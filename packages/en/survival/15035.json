Rich first appeared in\r\nthe U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Fisheries, Report of the\r\nUnited States Commissioner of Fisheries, for the fiscal year 1929.\r\n\r\nWhen Captain Robert McLellan of Boothbay Harbor died in 1981, the\r\nemployees of the Maine Department of Marine Resources contributed money\r\nto be used to purchase books in his memory, for the Department's\r\nFishermen's Library. Captain McLellan's family was asked what purchases\r\nthey would recommend, and a top priority was to somehow reprint this\r\nwork on the fishing grounds. This was a book that had been helpful to\r\nCaptain McLellan in his career, and one which his son, Captain Richard\r\nMcLellan, found still valid and useful.\r\n\r\nContributions from the employees of the Department of Marine Resources\r\npaid to get this project started; film to reproduce the pages of the\r\noriginal text was donated by the Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences;\r\nprinting costs were paid by the Department.\r\n\r\nIt is the hope of the Department and its employees that the fishermen of\r\ntoday will benefit from the detailed information in this publication,\r\nand that they will remember Captain Robert McLellan, a man who knew how\r\nto use books to enhance his career as a fisherman, who knew how to share\r\nhis knowledge with the scientific community, and who was widely\r\nrespected by fishermen and scientists alike.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nParalleling the northeastern coast line of North America lies a long\r\nchain of fishing banks--a series of plateaus and ridges rising from the\r\nocean bed to make comparatively shallow soundings. From very early times\r\nthese grounds have been known to and visited by the adventurers of the\r\nnations of western Europe--Northman, Breton, Basque, Portuguese,\r\nSpaniard, Frenchman, and Englishman. For centuries these fishing areas\r\nhave played a large part in feeding the nations bordering upon the\r\nWestern Ocean, and the development of their resources has been a great\r\nfactor in the exploration of the New World.\r\n\r\nAccording to statistics collected by the Bureau of Fisheries.[2] these\r\nbanks annually produce over 400,000,000 pounds of fishery products,\r\nwhich are landed in the United States; and, according to O. E. Sette,[3]\r\nannually about 1,000,000,000 pounds of cod are taken on these banks and\r\nlanded in the United States, Canada, Newfoundland, France, and Portugal.\r\n\r\nApparently the earliest known and certainly the most extensive of these\r\nis the Great Bank of Newfoundland, so named from time immemorial. From\r\nthe Flemish Cap, in 44° 06' west longitude and 47° north latitude,\r\nmarking the easternmost point of this great area, extends the Grand Bank\r\nwestward and southwestward over about 600 miles of length. Thence, other\r\ngrounds continue the chain, passing along through the Green Bank, St.\r\nPeters Bank, Western Bank (made up of several more or less connected\r\ngrounds, such as Misaine Bank, Banquereau, The Gully, and Sable Island\r\nBank); thence southwest through Emerald Bank, Sambro, Roseway, La Have,\r\nSeal Island Ground, Browns Bank, and Georges Bank with its southwestern\r\nextension of Nantucket Shoals.\r\n\r\nTo all these is added the long shelving area extending from the coast\r\nout to the edge of the continental plateau and stretching from the South\r\nShoal off Nantucket to New York, making in all, from the eastern part of\r\nthe Grand Bank to New York Bay, a distance of about 2,000 miles, an\r\nalmost continuous extent of most productive fishing ground.\r\n\r\nWithin the bowl that is the Gulf of Maine, the outer margin of which is\r\nmade by the shoaling of the water over the Seal Island Grounds, Browns\r\nBank, and Georges Bank, this chain is further extended by another series\r\nof smaller grounds, as Grand Manan Bank, the German Bank, Jeffreys Bank,\r\nCashes Bank, Platts Bank, Jeffreys Ledge, Fippenies Bank, Stellwagen or\r\nMiddle Bank; and again, lying inside these, this fishing area is\r\nincreased by a very large number of smaller grounds and fishing spots\r\nlocated within a very short distance of the mainland.\r\n\r\nAll these banks are breeding places of the most valued of our food\r\nfishes--the cod, haddock, cusk, hake, pollock, and halibut--and each\r\nin its proper season furnishes fishing ground where are taken many other\r\nimportant species of migratory and pelagic food fishes as well as those\r\nnamed here. It is probable that no other fishing area equaling this in\r\nsize or in productivity exists anywhere else in the world, and the\r\nfigures of the total catch taken from it must show an enormous poundage\r\nand a most imposing sum representing the value of its fishery.\r\n\r\nWith the most distant of these grounds we shall not deal here, leaving\r\nthem for later consideration when noting certain of the fishery\r\noperations most characteristic of them. Thus, we may treat of those\r\nwell-defined areas that lie within or are adjacent to the Gulf of Maine,\r\nsuch as the Bay of Fundy, the Inner Grounds (those close to the\r\nmainland), the Outer Grounds (those within the gulf), the Georges area,\r\nSeal Island Grounds, and Browns Bank, these forming the outer margin of\r\nthe gulf; and also make mention of certain others of those nearer\r\noffshore banks that are most closely connected with the market fishery\r\nof the three principal fishing ports within the Gulf of Maine.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: First published as Appendix III to the Report of the US\r\nCommissioner of Fisheries for 1929. Bureau of Fisheries Doc# 1059.\r\nSubmitted for publication Jan 18,1929.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: U.S. Bureau of Fisheries Statistical Bulletin No. 703]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: U.S. Bureau of Fisheries Document No. 1034]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\r\n\r\nAs to the charts, it has been the writer's endeavor, by consulting a\r\nlarge number of fishing captains of long experience upon these grounds,\r\nto reduce the margin of inaccuracy as much as possible. In case of\r\nconflict of their opinion, the greatest agreement as to the facts has\r\nbeen accepted.\r\n\r\nThe grounds as drawn are not meant to include any definite depth curve\r\nbut are meant to show certain fishing areas. It is known of course, that\r\nmost species frequent the shallows and the deep water at the various\r\nseasons: also, that certain other species are found on the deeper\r\nsoundings during virtually all the year. Thus, if a given area appears\r\nas a larger ground than is shown upon other charts made for navigating\r\npurposes, often this is because we have included in it a cusk ground or\r\na hake bottom lying adjacent to the shoal as charted.\r\n\r\nA large number of these grounds have been described before by G. Browne\r\nGoode and others, and where possible their work has been used as a basis\r\nfor the present paper, with any further information or the noting of any\r\nchanged condition of the grounds or difference in fishing methods\r\nemployed upon them that was obtainable.\r\n\r\nGrateful acknowledgment is hereby made to the many captains who\r\nfurnished information that, made the drawing of the charts possible and\r\nfor the facts used in the descriptions of the fishing grounds.\r\n\r\nWith the offshore banks, particularly with the Georges area and Browns\r\nBank and to a certain extent, also, the western portion of the Inner\r\nGrounds, the writer has had a considerable personal acquaintance from\r\nwhich to draw.\r\n\r\nFor the geographical and historical data the writer has quoted freely\r\nfrom various modern authors, who, in their turn, have drawn their facts\r\nfrom older records. Among those quoted are Holmes's American Annals;\r\nParkman's Pioneers of France in the New World; Southgates History of\r\nScarburo; Abbott and Elwell's History of Maine; Willis's History of\r\nMaine; Sabine's Report on the Principal Fisheries of the American Seas;\r\nA History of the Discovery of the East Coast of North America, by Dr.\r\nJohn G. Kohl, of Bremen, Germany; various chapters of Hakluyt's Voyages;\r\nthe Journal of John Jocelyn, Gent.; and New England Trials of the famous\r\nCaptain John Smith.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGULF OF MAINE--GEOGRAPHICAL & HISTORICAL NAME\r\n\r\nWhat is apparently the earliest mention of this body of water appears\r\non some old Icelandic charts that show, roughly, Cape Cod Bay in\r\ntheir southern areas and the Bay of Fundy in the northern. On these maps\r\nthe cape itself was shown on the \"Promontory of Vinland\" and was given\r\nthe name Kialarnes, or the Ship's Nose, from its resemblance in form to\r\nthe high upturned prow of the old Norse ships. To the entire area of the\r\ngulf was given the title Vinland's Haf.\r\n\r\nOviedo (Historia General de las Indias) sometimes names this gulf the\r\nArcipelago de La Tramontana, or the Arcipelago Septentrional--the\r\nnorthern archipelago. He gives us to understand that he, himself, or\r\nChaves, had this information from the Report and Survey of Gomez, who,\r\nin his search for a northwest passage to Asia in 1525, \"discovered all\r\nthese coasts lying between 41° and 41° 30' north\". As a matter of fact,\r\nhis careful explorations certainly covered all the territory between 40\r\nand 45 degrees.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish navigators who followed Gomez, in describing these coasts,\r\nwhen indicating this gulf, usually named it in honor of Gomez, the first\r\nof their nation to make a careful survey of its shores. Thus it became\r\nknown as the Arcipelago de Estevan Gomez, and the mainland behind it as\r\nLa Tierra de Gomez. It was so named on the map of Ribero in 1529 who\r\nthus acknowledged the source of his information.\r\n\r\nThe Biscayans followed Gomez but later gave way to the French fishermen,\r\nwho followed down the chain of banks extending southward from the Grand\r\nBank and entered these waters by way of Cape Sable. These gave to it the\r\nname Gulf of Norumbega or Sea of Norumbega. The name Norumbega was for a\r\ntime applied to the coast lands and to the inland country stretching\r\naway indefinitely westward and northwestward from the waters of the\r\ngulf.\r\n\r\nLater, with the coming of the English and the establishment of their\r\ncolony in Massachusetts, the title Massachusetts Bay came into general\r\nuse, although this name was afterwards restricted to the smaller section\r\nof the gulf at present so termed.\r\n\r\nThe charter of Gorges (in April, 1639) designated the territory deeded\r\nto him as the Province or County of Maine,[4] whence, perhaps, the\r\nmodern custom of referring to these waters as the Gulf of Maine may have\r\narisen. This latest name seems especially appropriate, in view of the\r\nfact that the present State of Maine lying directly opposite its\r\nentrance capes, stretches along the inner borders of the gulf and with\r\nits deeply indented shore line occupies by far the greatest section of\r\nits coasts. Thus the title has finally come into general use and\r\nacceptance in modern times. Apparently it was first officially proposed\r\nand used by the Edinburgh Encyclopedia in 1832 [5] and later was adopted by\r\nthe United States Coast Survey.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: \"All that parte, purport and porcion of the Mayne Land of New\r\nEngland, we doe name, ordeyne and appoynt shall forever hereafter bee\r\ncalled and named The Province and Countie of Mayne.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Edinburgh Encyclopedia, Philadelphia edition, by Thomas\r\nParker, Vol. XVIII, p. 263.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION\r\n\r\nA very striking and peculiar body of water is this Gulf of Maine,\r\nmarkedly different in character from any other of the bays on the coast\r\nline of the eastern United States. Especially does it differ in the\r\ndepth of its coastal waters, where in all the others, except the much\r\nsmaller New York Bay, the shoal water is found extending far out from\r\nthe land.\r\n\r\nIn the Gulf of Maine, however, with the single exception of the vicinity\r\nof Ammens Rock on the eastern part of Cashes Bank, the entire central\r\narea presents navigable deep water having a mean depth of 100 fathoms,\r\nout of which rise the various underwater plateaus, whose depths average\r\nabout 50 fathoms and which constitute the larger of the fishing grounds.\r\nIn addition to these, many smaller banks and \"fishing spots\" are found\r\nnearer the land where they lie a along the 50-fathom curve.\r\n\r\nIn general this curve lies at a distance of about 16 miles from the\r\ncoast line, but in many instances it approaches much neared to the\r\nmainland. From this 50-fathom depth the soundings decrease very\r\ngradually to the 20 and 10 fathom marks.\r\n\r\nThese latter soundings are often held far in toward the coast line, even\r\ncarrying the deep water well into the river mouths, so that in deeply\r\nindented hays, in long inlets running far into land, in the river\r\nmouths, the deep water behind the rocky headlands, or in the lee of the\r\nthousands of surf-washed islands that line the coast, are found\r\ninnumerable safe anchorages within easy run of the fishing grounds,\r\nwhere the fleets may take shelter from a sudden blow or await the\r\narrival of a \"fish day,\" when conditions may permit \"making a set\" under\r\nthe hardships of winter fishing.\r\n\r\nIf the marine features of this region are radically different from those\r\nof other coastal bodies of the eastern United States, so, too, the shore\r\nland, battered as it has been by sea and storm or worn by glacial action\r\nor Arctic currents, is no less remarkable.\r\n\r\nNo other section of the eastern United States has a similar coast, so\r\nserrated, indented, and rugged, as has this shore line of the Gulf of\r\nMaine. Here the battering by the forces of nature has resulted in making\r\nthousands of safe harbors and havens for the navigator. All along shore\r\nare strewn hundreds of islands, a characteristic feature of the region\r\nand one noted with wonder by every early explorer. [6] These islands, if\r\nnear the land, are beautiful and smiling; if in the open sea, of rugged\r\ngrandeur; and mainland and island alike are inhabited by a numerous and\r\nhardy race of fisher folk.\r\n\r\nThe tides within the Gulf of Maine have a very great rise and fall as\r\ncompared with other waters in this region. At the south of Cape Cod\r\ntides are seldom over 4 feet in their range, but beginning at once at\r\nthe north of Cape Cod with a rise of from 7 to 10 feet these increase\r\nquite constantly as they go eastward reaching about 28 feet in the\r\nneighborhood of Passamaquoddy Bay, to touch their highest point in the\r\nBay of Fundy, where in many places is a rise and fall of 50 feet, and in\r\nsome few places tides of 70 feet are reported. These Fundy tides\r\nprobably are the greatest in the world.\r\n\r\nThis great ebb and flow of water serves to aid shipbuilding and the\r\nlaunching of vessels as well as to carry the deep water far up into the\r\ninlets of the coast and into the mouths of the rivers, making these\r\nnavigable for crafts of considerable size well into the land or up to\r\nthe lowest falls of the streams.\r\n\r\nThe climate here is one of extremes, and, lying as it does between 42°\r\nand 45° north latitude, the region may be said to be cold. Apparently\r\nthe waters of the Gulf of Maine are not affected by any stray current\r\nfrom the Gulf Stream, which passes at a considerable distance from its\r\nmouth, thus doing little to temper the cold of this area either on land\r\nor at sea. Whether these waters are cooled further by any flow from the\r\nLabrador Current may be questioned.\r\n\r\nThe winters are long, usually bringing heavy snowfalls; and strong gales\r\nare frequent during much of the fall and winter season. Perhaps the most\r\ndangerous of these \"blows\" come out of the mountain to the north and\r\nnorthwest of the gulf. Thus, in addition to the uncertainty of an\r\nopportunity to set gear when once upon the fishing grounds, the winter\r\nfishing here is not without its element of serious danger. While the ice\r\ncrop in northern New England never fails, yet, perhaps because of the\r\nstrong tidal currents of these waters, the principal harbors rarely are\r\nclosed by ice, or, if closed, for but a few days only.\r\n\r\nWhile the summers are fairly mild and in certain parts of them even\r\nextremely hot, fogs are heavy and virtually continuous during the \"dog\r\ndays\" (July 20 to September 1). when southerly and south-westerly\r\nbreezes bring the warm moist air from the Gulf Stream into the cooler\r\ncurrents from the land. The fogs of Fundy are especially noted, even in\r\nthese waters. During the summer seasons winds from the east and north\r\nbring the only clear weather experienced in the outer chain of fishing\r\ngrounds.\r\n\r\nThe main body of the gulf lies approximately between 42° and 45° north\r\nlatitude. It is in form like a deep bowl whose outer rim is made by\r\nGeorges Bank and Browns Bank, with a narrow, deep-water spillway\r\nbetween: its area is half encircled in the arms of the mainland, two\r\nconspicuous headlands reaching bodily seaward to mark its wide entrance\r\nat the opposite sides--Cape Cod, Mass. [7] on the western side, and Cape\r\nSable, [8] Nova Scotia, on the eastern flank, distant from each other\r\nabout 230 miles. These two capes range with each other about ENE. and\r\nWSW, thus matching alike the general trend of the coast line, of the\r\nisland chains and of the offshore ledges within this area.\r\n\r\nFrom a base line connecting these outposts of the gulf the distance to\r\nthe Maine coast opposite averages about 120 miles. From Cape Sable, at\r\nits eastern end, the coast trends for some distance to the northwest,\r\nwhence a continuation of this course strikes the coast of Maine near\r\nWest Quoddy Head at a distance of rather more than 110 miles. From West\r\nQuoddy head to Cape Elizabeth (in a direct line about 160 miles) the\r\ncoast, in general rough, rocky, and with many lofty headlands is\r\nextremely irregular and deeply indented and follows a general course of\r\nWSW. Thence, the coast, lower and becoming more and more sandy, begins\r\nto trend more decidedly south-west until it reaches Boston, when it\r\nturns to the southeast, and to the east toward Cape Cod.\r\n\r\nBut this is not the entire story. There remain outside of these stated\r\nlimits the Bay of Fundy in the north, with a possible area of 3,000\r\nsquare miles; and at the south Cape Cod Bay, whose area, with that of\r\nthe waters west of a perpendicular drawn from the western end of the\r\nbase line that strikes the land in the vicinity of Portsmouth, N. H.\r\nmakes an additional section containing close to 1,500 square miles.\r\nWithin the limits thus inclosed there are, roughly, 30,000 square miles\r\nof most productive ground most intensively fished through all the year.\r\n\r\nThe Bay of Fundy is divided at its head by Cape Chignecto, making two\r\nbranches to north and to east--Chignecto Bay and Minas Basin. With\r\nthese smaller areas, lying as they do entirely within the territorial\r\nlimits of Canada, American fishermen have little to do, although both\r\nare valuable and productive fishing grounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: William Strachey (1609), speaking particularly of Casco Bay,\r\nbut the words equally applicable to almost any stretch of the Maine\r\ncoast, says \"A very great bay in which there lyeth soe many islands and\r\nsoe thick and neere together, that can hardly be discerned the number,\r\nyet may any ship pause betwixt, the greatest part of them having seldom\r\nlesse water than eight or ten fathoms about them\"--History of Travalle\r\ninto Virginia Britannica.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: This, the most striking cape of the Atlantic coast line,\r\nmade a very prominent landmark for all the early ocean voyagers\r\napproaching it, and all were greatly impressed by it, whether they came\r\nfrom the south and fought their way through its shoals to eastward, or,\r\ncoming from the north, found themselves caught in the deep pocket which\r\nit makes with Cape Cod Bay.\r\n\r\nThe Spaniard Gomez (1525) gave it the name \"Cabo de do Aricifes\" cape\r\nof the reefs, referring to the dangerous shoals to the eastward. The\r\nFrenchmen Champlain and Du Monts named it \"Cape Blanc\", and the Dutch\r\npilots, also noting its sandy cliffs, called it Witte Hoeck. The English\r\nmariners at first accepted his last name of White Cape, but the English\r\nCaptain Anthony Gosnold, the first to make a direct passage to the\r\nwaters of the Gulf of Maine from Europe, although at first he called it\r\n\"Shoal Hope\", soon changed this, because of the success of his fishing,\r\nto \"Cape Cod\", which title, commonplace though it be, has been the name\r\nto endure despite Prince Charles's attempt to change it to Cape James in\r\nhonor of his father.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: Cape Sable, at the southern end of Nova Scotia, has held\r\nthis title from very old times. It is so indicated on a Portuguese map\r\nof the middle of the sixteenth century.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBAY OF FUNDY\r\n\r\nAt the different seasons of the year the entire Bay of Fundy [9] is a\r\nfishing ground for sardines and large herring; and while these are of\r\nsomewhat less importance in recent years than formerly, the principal\r\nfisheries of this region still center around the herring industries--the\r\nsupplying of the canning factories with the small herring used as\r\nsardines and the taking of large herring for food and bait. The sardine\r\nindustry of the State of Maine is largely concentrated in the district\r\nabout and including Eastport and Lubec, where about 30 of the 59\r\nfactories and 16 of the 43 operating firms are located; so that, while\r\nthe herring catches of recent years have fallen much short of their\r\nformer proportions, they still show imposing figures.\r\n\r\nIn the past much of the catch was taken in St. Andrews (Passamaquoddy)\r\nBay and along the north shore of the Bay of Fundy to Lepreau Bay and\r\nPoint. Lepreau. Of late years virtually no herring have been taken in\r\nthese waters, in which the herring schools that arrive in October were\r\naccustomed to remain until spring. Of past fishing in this locality\r\nCapt. Sumner Stuart, of Lubec, says:\r\n\r\n\"The herring left St. Andrews Bay and the North Shore about 1885. There\r\nis no summer netting there now. Those waters and Lepreau Bay were\r\nformerly very productive fishing grounds, it being not unusual to take\r\n5,000 (count) big herrings (food fish) in a single haul. These were\r\nmainly spring and winter fishing grounds for large herring. The fish\r\nseem to have disappeared from all these grounds at about the same\r\ntime.[10]\r\n\r\n\"In past years (25 to 30 years ago) small herring were driven ashore in\r\nsuch quantities by their enemies--squid, silver hake and dogfish--that\r\nit sometimes became necessary for the authorities at St. John to use a\r\nsnowplow to cover them where they lay decaying on the beach.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the statistics of the sardine and smoked-herring industry for the\r\nyear 1924 (a year, be it noted, in which the sardine industry almost\r\nreached low--level mark for the pack) the waters of the Bay of Fundy\r\nfurnished to American purchasers alone a total of herring for smoking\r\nand canning purposes amounting to 76,756,250 pounds valued to the\r\nfishermen at $957,665. This showing, poor as it is when compared with\r\nthe figures of other years, by no means represents the herring fishery\r\nas an unimportant industry. There still remains to be accounted for the\r\ncatch of herring of Grand Manan and the neighboring Canadian Provinces.\r\n\r\nA new source of profit to the fishermen in this industry has been\r\ndeveloped in the purchase of herring scales by firms engaged in the\r\nmanufacture of artificial pearls. For this purpose there were collected\r\nat Eastport and Lubec 700,000 pounds of herring scales, valued at\r\n$39,000; and a further amount was taken at Grand Manan of 140,000\r\npounds, valued at $7,000. With other entrants already in the field, this\r\nbranch of the industry bids fair to grow to still greater importance.\r\n\r\nAn estimate of the number of weirs in St. Andrews Bay, by Capt. Guilford\r\nMitchell of Eastport, Me., is as follows: Canadian: 1921: 126 weirs\r\n1923: 40 weirs Calais to Eastport: 1921: 35 weirs; 1923: 7 weirs Total\r\nnumber in operation, 1923, Canadian, about 300; American less than 130.\r\n\r\nNorth Shore and coast of Nova Scotia. Along the North Shore\r\nand from Yarmouth to Cape Sable, over a hard bottom, cod abound. The\r\nwestern shore of Nova Scotia is virtually all fishing ground for cod,\r\nhaddock, hake, and cusk, but trawling is somewhat handicapped here by\r\nstrong tides and rocky bottom, these combining to destroy much gear.\r\nHalibut are somewhat unusual on this western shore except about the\r\nmouth of the Bay of Fundy, but in summer these fish are occasionally\r\nfound close inshore along the southwest coast, going somewhat beyond\r\nDigby to the northward. Haddocking is quite an important industry off\r\nYarmouth, Nova Scotia, during the winter, the sets being of rather\r\nshort duration and made at the slack of the tide at high water. This\r\npractice is made necessary by the heavy tidal currents on these grounds.\r\n\r\nThe whole western coast of Nova Scotia is herring ground at some season\r\nof the year. \"Drifting\" for herring was formerly a considerable industry\r\nfrom Digby to Briers Island, but in these last few years it has not been\r\nimportant, although the year 1927 had a very good run of large food\r\nfish. This western coast is also an important fishing area for lobster\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nSwordfishing in the Bay of Fundy was formerly profitable in September,\r\nalthough these fish were never so numerous here as upon the outer shore\r\nof Nova Scotia.\r\n\r\nSt. Marys Bay is a summer herring ground. Good haddocking may be had\r\nhere, also, from April 15 to October 15, with the period from the\r\nopening of the fishing in April up to July 15 the best of it.\r\n\r\nThe mackerel fishery of the Bay of Fundy seems of comparatively small\r\nimportance in these latter years. The local fishermen say that the fish\r\ncan not stem the tides of these waters! The abundance of small herring\r\nshould be an inducement sufficient to bring them here. Apparently these\r\nfish pass straight inshore northwesterly and reach the coast of Maine. A\r\nconsiderable amount of this species is taken by traps and by netting in\r\nSt. Marys Bay and in the general vicinity of Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, as\r\nat Cranberry Head, Burns Point. Beaver River, Woods Harbor, and at\r\nvarious other points between Yarmouth and Cape Sable; but the inner\r\nwaters of the Bay of Fundy show very slim catches when compared with the\r\ngreat amount taken on the outer shores of Nova Scotia in a normal\r\nmackerel season. It has been 32 years, it is said, since any number of\r\nmackerel have been \"hooked\" in St. Mary's Bay.\r\n\r\nLurcher Shoal. This lies WSW, from Cape St, Mary 19 miles and WNW, from\r\nCape Fourchu, distant 13 miles, it is an irregularly shaped piece of\r\nbottom, a rocky ground, about 5 miles long, north and south, by 3 miles\r\nwide, There are a number of \"nubbles\" arising to 5, 7, and 9 fathom\r\ndepths--with a spot reported as having only 12 feet of water over it--\r\nrising from the average depths over the rest of the shoal of from 13 to\r\n15 fathoms. Over this generally rocky bottom are scattered patches of\r\ngravel and of shells, Depths about the shoal are from 30 to 50 fathoms\r\nover a bottom consisting mostly of stones, Tide rips are very heavy\r\nhere, The seasons and species found here are as on Trinity: cod,\r\nhaddock, pollock, and herring, it is a good lobster ground.\r\n\r\nTrinity Shoal. This shoal, 14 miles N. by W. from Cape Fourchu and\r\n7½ miles SW. from Cape St Mary, with a rocky bottom upon it and over\r\nan indefinite area about it, is perhaps 3 miles long, NE and SW, by\r\nsome 2 miles wide. Near the center is a rock, uncovered at low water,\r\nbut over the greater part of the shoal there are depths of from 6 to 10\r\nfathoms, with an average of from 12 to 16 fathoms over the sandy and\r\nstony ground about it. There is a strong tide rip here on the eastern\r\nand northeastern part known as Flood Tide Eddy, where is good fishing by\r\nhand line for pollock in September and October. Cod and haddock are\r\ntaken here in small amounts by trawling. It is a herring ground also,\r\nand there is a lobster ground on the shoal and all about it.\r\n\r\nA cod ground extends offshore SW from Briers Island, beginning about 5\r\nmiles out from the island and extending to about 18 miles from the land.\r\nIts width is about 4 miles. Depths over this area are from 40 to 60\r\nfathoms over a hard, shelly bottom. Cod are taken here in from 30 to 44\r\nfathoms on the shoal ground running from 5 miles from Gull Rock and the\r\nSouth-West Ledges down to the Lurcher Shoal, a distance of about 22\r\nmiles. Between these points fishing is done mostly by hand-lining \"at a\r\ndrift.\" Cod are taken over the ledges in 5 fathoms of water and thence\r\nout to 60 fathoms about them from August to November. Pollock are taken\r\nby the same method. The best season is August. September, and October.\r\nThis is a good lobster ground.\r\n\r\nNorthwest Ledge. Lies about 3 3/4 miles northwesterly from Briers\r\nIsland. This is a piece of rocky bottom about 2 miles long by something\r\nless than 1 mile wide with depths of from 2 to 10 fathoms over the ledge\r\nand soundings of 12 to 30 fathoms on the gravelly ground about it. Cod\r\nare found here in good number from September to November, inclusive, and\r\nare taken by hand-lining. Pollock also are taken here in summer,\r\n\"drailing\" by hand line.\r\n\r\nA narrow piece of rocky ground with somewhat greater depths connects\r\nthis with Batsons Shoal, some 5 miles SW., the two thus making what is\r\nvirtually one piece of ground. Depths on Batsons Shoal are rather less\r\nthan on Northwest Ledge, but the methods of fishing, the species taken,\r\nand the seasons of their abundance are the same on both. The bottom all\r\nabout these two grounds is rocky, with from 20 to 40 fathoms inside of\r\nthem, but this deepens rapidly to 100 fathoms over rocks and coarse\r\ngravel outside of them to W. and NW.\r\n\r\nWest-Northwest Rips and the Flat Ground. These lie WNW from Briers\r\nIsland, extending offshore about 18 miles. On the eastern end of this\r\narea, two parallel shoals, about 1½ miles across and having 50-fathom\r\ndepths between them, rise from the 100-fathom depths of water over the\r\nmuddy ground around them to reach 15 fathoms on the landward end of the\r\nrips, deepening to 35 fathoms off the western part, where the two ridges\r\ncome together at about 9 miles distance from Briers Island, to carry on\r\nto the westward over the Flat Ground, which extends to a distance of\r\nabout 18 miles from the island.\r\n\r\nThis Flat Ground, deepening gradually westward, averages to have 50\r\nfathoms of water over a level, gravelly, and rocky bottom, to pitch down\r\nsuddenly, as do all other slopes of this piece of ground, to the\r\n100-fathom depth, which prevails on all sides of The Rips. Currents are\r\nvery strong here, as elsewhere in these waters, so that trawls are set\r\nonly on the slack of the tides, beginning about one hour before and\r\nremaining down until about one hour after these periods. Formerly this\r\nwas a good ground for the taking of large herring. In these days The\r\nRips furnish good cod and haddock fishing for the entire year, with hake\r\nabundant at all times on the mud about them. In fact; virtually all the\r\nground from this point south to the Lurcher Shoal furnishes good fishing\r\nfor these species.\r\n\r\nBoars Head Ground (also called Inner Ground). This parallels the coast\r\nabout 4 miles N. by NW from the Head, at Petit Passage, into St.\r\nMarys Bay. This ground is about 4 miles long by 3 miles wide, having\r\ndepths from 55 to 65 fathoms over a hard bottom of broken ground. Cod\r\nare most numerous here from April to July, inclusive; haddock from July\r\nto September, inclusive. Hake are found here in summer and early fall,\r\nprincipally on the muddy ground between this and the next fishing\r\nground--the Outer Ground.\r\n\r\nOuter Ground. This is about 3 miles long by 2 miles wide, lies about 9\r\nmiles out from the main on the same bearing as the Inner Ground, and is\r\nvisited by the same species, their periods of abundance upon this piece\r\nof bottom being the same as on the former ground. Virtually all taking\r\nof ground fish on these grounds is done by hand-lining, though the\r\npractice of trawl fishing has come more and more into use in recent\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nHead and Horns. A shoal of 68 fathoms, about 2 miles long in a NNE and\r\nSSW direction by 1 mile wide, lies due north from the Boars Head of Long\r\nIsland. Here is a hard bottom where good cod fishing is had during the\r\nspring and summer. Hand-lining from the bottom is carried on in summer\r\nfor pollock. Haddock are few here, these appearing mostly in the summer.\r\nDepths about the ground average 80 fathoms over mud and stones.\r\n\r\nSandy Cove Ground. Lies offshore NNE about 7 miles from West Sandy\r\nCove. It has from 40 to 50 fathoms of water over a sandy bottom, lying\r\nparallel with the coast, about 4 miles long by 2 miles wide. Cod are\r\nabundant on this ground from May to July, hake coming somewhat later. As\r\nwere most of the grounds of this vicinity, this ground was mainly a\r\nhand-line spot, but in recent years fishing here has been done mostly by\r\nthe trawl method.\r\n\r\nInner Sandy Cove Grounds. About 2 miles NNW. from West Sandy Cove.\r\nThese are 3 miles long NNE. and SSW. by ½ mile wide. Both hand-lining\r\nand trawling methods of fishing are in use here, but the trawl is fast\r\ndisplacing the older gear. Depths are about 35 fathoms over a sandy\r\nbottom and 50 fathoms all about it. Species and their seasons of\r\nabundance are as on the Outer Sandy Cove Ground. Almost anywhere\r\nbetween Spencer Island and Cape Split there is good haddock fishing in\r\nJune and July and cod fishing in May and June. Depths are from 16 to 40\r\nfathoms: the bottom is generally stony, with considerable areas of\r\ngravel. The fishing is done principally by trawling, rather short \"sets\"\r\nbeing made. Off Cape Split are considerable whirlpools, which, with\r\nspring tides, are very dangerous. These sometimes run 9 knots an hour.\r\n\r\nSpencer Island. Almost anywhere between Spencer Island and Cape Split\r\nthere is good haddock fishing in June and July and cod fishing in May\r\nand June. Depths are from 16 to 40 fathoms: the bottom is generally\r\nstony, with considerable areas of gravel. The fishing is done\r\nprincipally by trawling, rather short \"sets\" being made. Off Cape Split\r\nare considerable whirlpools, which, with spring tides, are very\r\ndangerous. These sometimes run 9 knots an hour.\r\n\r\nIsle au Haute. Lies far up within the bay 9 miles W. ½ S. from Cape\r\nChignecto. All about this island are good summer haddock grounds with\r\nfair cod fishing. The latter are taken by trawling principally. Depths\r\nabout the island are from 9 to 14 fathoms, deepening offshore to 35, the\r\naverage depths being 22 to 27 fathoms. North of the island the bottom is\r\ngenerally sandy; elsewhere much of the ground is rocky or stony, with\r\nhere and there a small patch of gravelly ground. To the S. of this\r\nground, toward the Nova Scotia shore and to within 2 miles of the coast,\r\nthe bottom is mainly muddy and of little account as a fishing ground.\r\nTides are very heavy on all the inner grounds of the Bay of Fundy.\r\n\r\nQuaco Ledges. This ground lies about 10 miles SE, from Quaco Head and\r\nis out at low tide, the water about the ledges having depths from 14 to\r\n30 fathoms over a bottom of stones and gravel, There is a heavy tide rip\r\nover these ledges when covered, These furnish good pollock fishing in\r\nthe summer months, and cod fishing is carried on here by hand-lining\r\nfrom May to July.\r\n\r\nSalmon Netting Ground. A salmon-netting ground lies off about the\r\nMouth Harbour and St, John Harbour, where these fish are netted, for the\r\nmost part during June and July, when they are en route to the St, John\r\nRiver, where are their spawning grounds.\r\n\r\nIngalls Shoal. This is the name given by some of the fishermen of the\r\nvicinity to a shoal lying about midway between Digby, Nova Scotia, and\r\nPoint Lepreau, New Brunswick. This ground is about 9 miles long. NE. and\r\nSW., by about 5 miles wide. It lies about 22 miles NW. from Digby and 18\r\nor 20 miles from Point Lepreau. The depths are from 35 fathoms on the\r\nshoalest area (where is a piece of ground some 4 miles long by 1 mile\r\nwide near the center of the bank, lying in a NE. and SW. direction), the\r\nbottom sloping away from this on all sides to 47 or even 55 fathoms in a\r\nfew places. The bottom is mostly of sand and gravel or of small stones\r\nover much of the ground except for the shoal parts, where it is mainly\r\nrocky. This piece of fishing ground furnishes good cod fishing in June,\r\nJuly, and August, which formerly was carried on by hand-lining but now,\r\nas elsewhere in the bay, is more and more becoming a trawl fishery.\r\nHaddock and pollock also are taken here in fair amounts.\r\n\r\nMussel Shoal Ground. This is a mussel-covered bottom lying 8 miles ESE.\r\nfrom the Eastern Wolf and 9 miles from Point Lepreau. It runs in an E.\r\nand W. direction and is about 2 miles long by 1 mile wide. Depths are\r\nfrom 40 to 50 fathoms. This is a mussel and scallop bed, where large cod\r\nare usually in abundance in winter. Pollock are plenty here in June, and\r\nhake are here and in the surrounding Hake Ground in all the summer\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nThe Wolves. These make a group of small islands lying N. ½ E. from\r\nGrand Manan, distant 8 or 10 miles. On the bottom of rocks and gravel,\r\nextending about a mile from the shores of these, in depths of from 18 to\r\n34 fathoms, small boats and small vessels take a quantity of fish by\r\ntrawl and hand line. These are mainly haddock and cod grounds in May and\r\nJune and pollock grounds in June and July. It is also a winter lobster\r\nground for Canadian fishermen.\r\n\r\nThe Wolves Bank. This bank lies between The Wolves and Grand Manan,\r\ndistant about 8 miles from East Quoddy Light, SE. ½ E. Marks: The\r\nCoxcomb showing to the eastward and just touching on the western edge of\r\nGreen Island: bring the heads of Grand Manan to form The Armchair, and\r\nWhite Horse and Simpson Island into range. This is a small-boat ground\r\nof scarcely more than 6 acres, with depths of 18 to 30 fathoms on a\r\nbottom of rocks and mud. Species and seasons are as on The Wolves.\r\nSoutheast from The Wolves from 2 to 20 miles lies a piece of muddy\r\nbottom where hake are usually abundant in summer.\r\n\r\nCampobello and vicinity. Fair quantities of haddock and cod are found\r\nbetween Grand Manan and the American shore in the North Channel (Grand\r\nManan Channel) between West Quoddy Head and Grand Manan in depths of\r\nfrom 40 to 50 fathoms, over a bottom of rocks, mud, and sand in June,\r\nJuly, and August and up to September 15, while hake is the most abundant\r\nspecies present.\r\n\r\nNo haddock or cod are on these grounds in winter. Halibut are taken in\r\nsimilar numbers in the North Channel in May, June, and July. Pollock are\r\ntaken on the western side of Campobello Island, near the eastern side of\r\nIndian Island, and at the mouth of the channel between Campobello and\r\nCasco Bay Island. In all these places are strong tidal eddies. Some fish\r\nare taken by seining, but most are caught by hook and line in a\r\nsmall-boat fishery lasting from June 1 to September 1.\r\n\r\nAll around Campobello and Deer Island and on the New Brunswick shore as\r\nfar as St. John are located weirs, which furnish large quantities of\r\nherring to the factories at Eastport and Lubec.\r\n\r\nPassamaquoddy Bay. [11] Depths here are from 10 to 24 fathoms, even 30\r\nfathoms where the St. Croix River passes out into the sea. In general\r\nthe bottom is muddy, although there are rocky patches. In most years a\r\nschool of cod \"strikes\" here in April, the early corners being mostly of\r\nsmall size, but the later arrivals may reach 30, 40, or even 60 pounds.\r\nHaddock sometimes make their appearance in the bay as early as May 1,\r\nremaining through August. Hake, also, are present from June to\r\nSeptember, but this excellent fish is held of little account by local\r\nfishermen. A considerable flounder industry is developing in these\r\nwaters, the fish being taken in specially devised traps as well as by\r\nthe smaller otter trawls.\r\n\r\nPassamaquoddy Bay is also a spring netting ground for herring (food\r\nfish), and there are also many weirs in operation here each year whose\r\ncatch goes to the factories of Eastport and Lubec for canning as\r\nsardines. Pollock are very abundant, and a great deal of fishing for\r\nthem is carried on from June to October, both by seine and hand line. At\r\ntimes the pollock completely fill the many herring weirs, until, from\r\ntheir numbers, there is no market for them. Pollock are also abundant at\r\nthe same season and are taken by the same methods in the St. Croix\r\nRiver, though perhaps they leave the river a month earlier in the fall.\r\n\r\nThe Mud Hake Grounds. These grounds extend about N. and S. between\r\nCampobello and The Wolves and from about West Quoddy Head to Grand\r\nManan. Their length is about 15 to 18 miles and their width 3½ miles.\r\nThis is a summer ground much used by Canadian fishermen out of\r\nCampobello, Grand Manan, and Beaver Harbor. It is said to be the best\r\nhake grounds in this vicinity. Depths are from 45 to 60 fathoms, and\r\nfishing is done by trawls and hand lines.\r\n\r\nThere is a stretch of muddy bottom from Point Lepreau and Beaver Harbor\r\nto Grand Manan, which furnishes good hake fishing. In general, the\r\nbottom on the western side of the Bay of Fundy is muddy. Off Beaver\r\nHarbor on a mud bottom with 30 fathoms of water cod are found the year\r\naround, although this fishery is mainly carried on in the winter in\r\nsmall craft from Beaver Harbor and Campobello, mostly by trawling, but\r\nsome hand-lining is carried on.\r\n\r\nBeaver Harbor. There is a stretch of muddy bottom from Point Lepreau\r\nand Beaver Harbor to Grand Manan, which furnishes good hake fishing. In\r\ngeneral, the bottom on the western side of the Bay of Fundy is muddy.\r\nOff Beaver Harbor on a mud bottom with 30 fathoms of water cod are found\r\nthe year around, although this fishery is mainly carried on in the\r\nwinter in small craft from Beaver Harbor and Campobello, mostly by\r\ntrawling, but some hand-lining is carried on.\r\n\r\nGrand Manan Bank. This bank is at the entrance of the Bay of Fundy, SW.\r\n½ S. from the southwest head of Grand Manan Island from which the\r\nnorthern part of the bank is 15 miles distant. From Mount Desert Rock,\r\nE. by S., it is 45 miles distant. The bank is 10 miles long and 5 miles\r\nwide, extending in a NE. and SW. direction. The bottom is mostly stones\r\nand gravel, the depths running from 24 to 45 fathoms. Soundings of 18\r\nand 21 fathoms are found on the northeast part.\r\n\r\nCod (especially abundant when the June school is on the ground) and\r\npollock are the principal fish. Haddock are not usually abundant,\r\nalthough sometimes they are plentiful in the fall from late September to\r\nDecember; hake are fairly abundant on the mud between Grand Manan Bank\r\nand the Middle Ground (in The Gully). This is a good halibut bank, the\r\nfish being in 33 to 60 fathoms in June and July; the southwest soundings\r\nand the southeast soundings are most productive always.\r\n\r\nThe best fishing season is from April to October, when the fish come to\r\nthis bank to feed. In the spring the fish, other than halibut, are\r\nmostly on the southwest part, but later (July to October) the best\r\nfishing is had on the northern edge of the ground. The very best herring\r\nfishing for large herring (food fish) occurs on this bank in June and\r\nJuly. In general, this is a small-vessel ground fished by craft from\r\nCutler, Eastport, Grand Manan, and, to a less extent, Yarmouth, Nova\r\nScotia, with an occasional visit by craft from Portland and Rockland,\r\nchiefly trawlers of moderate size.\r\n\r\nTides run NE. in flood and SW. on the ebb and are quite strong, the\r\nflood being the heaviest. Because of these powerful currents, fishing is\r\nsomewhat difficult, it being necessary to make sets at the slack of the\r\ntides, getting the gear over and traveling with the finish of the\r\ncurrent, to take it up and come back with the tide's return.\r\n\r\nClarks Ground. This lies SSE. from White head 4½ miles (just inside\r\nthe Bulkhead) and has depths from 6 to 14 fathoms over a rocky bottom.\r\nHere are very heavy rips on the ebb tide. This is a good summer ground\r\nfor pollock, cod, and halibut, and it is a good herring-netting ground\r\nin the season.\r\n\r\nSouthern Head Reef. The chain of reefs extending S from White Head\r\nIsland is all good ground in summer for cod and for pollock, also, when\r\nthe herring schools are on this ground. Currents are very heavy here.\r\nThe ledges that make up this reef are more or less connected. Among\r\nthese are Brazil Shoal, Tinker, Inner Diamond, Outer Diamond, Crawleys,\r\nRans, Proprietor (Foul Ground), and the Old Proprietor. While virtually\r\nall this reef is pollock ground, Crawleys and Rans perhaps furnish the\r\nbest fishing.\r\n\r\nGravelly. Lying about 5 or 6 miles SE. by S. from White Head, this\r\npiece of bottom has about 25-fathom depths over a rocky bottom. This is\r\na cod and pollock ground in their season. While an occasional halibut is\r\ntaken here in summer. Heavy tide rips occur here also.\r\n\r\nThe Soundings. Mentioned elsewhere as a herring ground, these lie\r\noutside the Bulkhead Rips 8 or 9 miles SE. from White Head. There are 30\r\nor 40 fathoms of water here over a rock bottom, where pollock and cod\r\nare found in good number in July, August, and September, and a certain\r\namount of halibut in summer.\r\n\r\nBulkhead Rips, also called The Ripplings. This is a long rocky barrier\r\nrising sharply from the deep water about it to depths of from 12 to 20\r\nfathoms. Here are found cod, haddock, hake, and pollock in abundance\r\nfrom June 1 to October 31. Apparently all are feeding on the small\r\nherring, so numerous in this vicinity at this season. Virtually no\r\nhaddock are found on the grounds in the near neighborhood of Grand Manan\r\nin winter. The Ripplings were formerly one of the principal fishing\r\ngrounds of the herring netters but of late years have been less\r\nproductive.\r\n\r\nCards Reef. The depths here are from 28 to 30 fathoms, over rocks, and\r\nthe ground lies 3 miles S. by E. from the Old Proprietor and 9 miles\r\nfrom White Head. This is a cod and haddock ground from June to\r\nNovember.\r\n\r\nGannet Rock. This lies east of the Murre Ledges. All about it is good\r\nground in from 40 to 70 fathoms over a hard bottom. Cod are found here\r\nin good number from March to May, and halibut are taken here from March\r\nto May, inclusive.\r\n\r\nSoutheast Ground and Gravel Bottom. These lie S. of Seal Island,\r\nforming an extensive piece of fairly level ground extensive piece of\r\nfairly level ground. The western part bears a little E. of S. and the\r\neastern part about ESE. from the island. It is about 5 or 10 miles in\r\ndiameter. While this is really but one piece of ground, the eastern part\r\nis called the Southeast Ground and the western part, from the nature of\r\nits bottom, the Gravel Bottom. The eastern portion is muddy and has 40\r\nto 60 fathoms. The western has 35 to 40 fathoms. It is a good cod ground\r\nin winter and spring. Haddock are present from November to March,\r\ninclusive; hake in summer. Fishing is done mainly by trawling by sloops\r\nand vessels.\r\n\r\nMachias Seal Island. Nineteen miles E. by S. from Moosabec Light.\r\nThis furnishes good ground in the water all about it, where depths are\r\nfrom 15 to 54 fathoms over a generally rocky and uneven bottom. In\r\nsummer cod, haddock, and pollock are abundant here, the cod and haddock\r\nremaining all winter. The fishery is carried on mostly by the smaller\r\nvessels from Maine ports, principally those from Cutler, with an\r\noccasional visit by larger craft, usually from the Portland fleet. This\r\nground is not much visited in winter. Fishing is done by trawling and\r\nhand-lining.\r\n\r\nGannet Rock. This lies east of the Murre Ledges. All about it is good\r\nground in from 40 to 70 fathoms over a hard bottom. Cod are found here\r\nin good number from March to May, and halibut are taken here from March\r\nto May, inclusive.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Table I--Fishing Grounds of the Bay of Fundy Area of the Gulf of Maine,\r\nshowing the principal species taken upon them.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: It (Fundy) was not clearly indicated by Verrazano (1524)\r\nnor in the report of Gomez (1525), who probably saw something of its\r\nentrance but fog or other unfavorable circumstances may have prevented\r\nhim from observing it more accurately, but we find in the first old\r\nSpanish maps, in the latitude where it ought to be, names like these:\r\n\r\nRio hondo or 'fondo' (a deep river) or Bahia Hondo (a deep bay), or\r\nGolfo (a gulf) once, also 'La Bahia de la ensenada', the bay of the deep\r\ninlet.\r\n\r\nDoctor Kohl, here quoted further says \"On the maps of the seventeenth\r\nand early part of the eighteenth century, especially, it is written Bay\r\nof Funda. I believe that this name grew out from and is a revival of,\r\nthe old Spanish name 'Bahia fondo'\".]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: It is gratifying to announce that the winter of 1925-26\r\nsaw a large run of herring on this ground, where for a number of years\r\npast there has been virtually no fishing for this species.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: \"According to Porter C. Bliss, a thorough student of the\r\nIndian dialects, Acadie is a pure Micmac word meaning place. In Nova\r\nScotia and Maine it is used by the Indians in composition with other\r\nwords, as in Pestum-Acadie; and in Etchemin, Pascatum-Acadie, now\r\nPassamaquoddy, meaning 'the place of the pollocks'\" (Doctor Kohl, _Dis.\r\nof Maine_, p. 234)\r\n\r\n\"This derivation is doubtful. The Micmac word Quoddy, Kady, or Cadie\r\nmeans simply a place or region and is properly used in conjunction with\r\nsome other noun; as, for example, Pestum-oquoddy (Passamaquoddy), the\r\nplace of pollocks.\" (Dawson and Hand, in _Canadian Antiquarian and\r\nNumismatic Journal_)\r\n\r\n\"La Cadie, or Arcadie: The word is said to be derived from the Indian\r\nAquoddiaukie, or Aquoddie, supposed to mean the fish called a pollock.\r\nThe Bay of Passamaquoddy, 'great pollock water,' if we may accept the\r\nsame authority, derives its name from the same origin.\" (Potter, in\r\n_Historical Magazine_, I, 84)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINNER GROUNDS\r\n\r\nUnder this heading are listed those grounds of the innermost chain of\r\nshoals, ledges, and \"fishing spots\", patches of rocky and gravelly\r\nbottom, the deeper water between them being over the muddy ground, which\r\nline the coast of the Gulf of Maine, making of it an almost continuous\r\npiece of fishing ground. In the Reports of the United States Bureau of\r\nFisheries, on which all the statistics of the catch and value of the\r\nvarious species quoted in this report are based, these figures are\r\ngrouped under the heading \"Shore\".\r\n\r\nThe larger and more important of these grounds are outcroppings along\r\nthe edge of the 50-fathom curve and lie at distances varying from 12 to\r\n20 miles offshore; but there are many inside this line, and where the\r\ndeep water of the Gulf of Maine extends so far inshore some are close in\r\nto the land. Thus, nearly all are within comparatively easy reach even\r\nfor the smaller craft (where these all now have power) and so furnish\r\nproductive fishing for a large fleet of gill netters and sloops (small\r\ncraft of from 5 to 10 tons net) and to the myriad of \"under-ton\" boats\r\n(of less than 5 tons net), all these being enabled to run offshore,\r\n\"make a set,\" and return the same day.\r\n\r\nWith the uncertainties of the weather and the hazards of the winter\r\nfishing, very often the large vessels also follow this practice on those\r\nnot too frequent \"fish days\" (when conditions permit fishing \"outside \")\r\nthat intervene between the storms; and with the scarcity of fish in the\r\nmarkets usual to the season and the consequent better price for the\r\ncatch, with ordinary fishing luck they are well paid for doing so.\r\n\r\nThe fish of these shore grounds, due perhaps to the greater abundance of\r\nfood here, are thought to be distinctly superior in quality to those of\r\nthe same species taken on the offshore banks. The cod and the haddock,\r\nespecially, of the Gulf of Maine are particularly well conditioned fish\r\nand are noted for their excellence.\r\n\r\nThe figures presented in Table 2 show only a fraction of the catch from\r\nthe Inner Grounds, since they deal entirely with the fares of fishing\r\nvessels of 5 net tons and over. There are literally thousands of the\r\nso-called \"licensed\" or \"under-tonned\" boats, mainly gill-netters, that\r\ntake millions of pounds from these waters annually, principally cod and\r\nhaddock.\r\n\r\nOn the Maine coast and across the line in New Brunswick there are more\r\nthan 300 weirs which furnished to American smokers and canners during\r\nthe year 1923 (whose figures have been chosen as representing an average\r\nseason) 77,000,000 pounds of herring. On the coast of Massachusetts\r\nthere are 50 or more weirs and fish traps, and from the Isle of Shoals\r\nto Pemaquid Point in Maine there are more than 50 floating traps in the\r\nvarious bays, on the points of offshore islands, or even in the open\r\nsea, and all these take a rich harvest from these waters. Then, too,\r\nthere is the lobster fishery, more important in the Gulf of Maine than\r\nanywhere else in the United States.\r\n\r\nOf these various branches of the fisheries industries few statistics are\r\navailable, yet we may say that the figures of the 1919 census showed\r\nthat the \"under-ton\" boats mentioned landed 5,324,426 pounds of fish at\r\nthe port of Boston, mostly of cod and haddock, and that the same type of\r\ncraft in 1923 landed at Portland, Me., more than 3,000,000 pounds,\r\nprincipally of ground fish. We also know that every island, hamlet,\r\nvillage, town, and city along this nearly 4,000 'miles of coast line\r\ntakes its toll from the sea.\r\n\r\nLukes Rock. This rock lies S. by E. 3 miles from Moosabec Light,\r\ncircular in shape, and about 1 mile in diameter. Depths are from 25 to\r\n35 fathoms; the bottom is rocks, gravel, and mud. This is mainly a\r\nsmall-boat fishing ground, but there is some vessel fishing. Hake are\r\ntaken here from June to September, inclusive; cod are present about the\r\nrocks the year around. Pollock are here in spring and fall, and haddock\r\nfrom December to February, inclusive. Fishing is by trawl and hand line.\r\n\r\nNewfound Ground. A small rocky spot about 1/4 mile across with an\r\nautomatic buoy in the center for guidance into the Bay of Fundy. This is\r\na small-boat ground having depths averaging 18 fathoms. It lies about 3\r\nmiles S. by W. from Moosabec Light. Species and seasons are as on Lukes\r\nRock. Fishing is by trawl and hand line.\r\n\r\nHenrys Rock. Five miles SW. by S. from Moosabec Light. 1/4 mile in\r\ndiameter, and 30 fathoms over a level bottom. Fishing is done by hand\r\nline and trawl. Cod are present the year around, a few haddock in the\r\nfall, hake in the summer but not in the fall, and pollock in spring and\r\nfall.\r\n\r\nHandspike Ground. Eight miles SW. by S. from Moosabec Light, nearly\r\ncircular in form, and ¼ mile across. It has a bottom of rocks and depths\r\nof from 35 to 40 fathoms. Species and seasons are the same as on Lukes\r\nRock, but mainly cod and pollock are taken here by trawl and hand line.\r\n\r\nWestern Egg Rock. This is SW. from Moosabec Light, 8 miles distant,\r\nlying in a NE. and SW. direction, 3 miles long by 1 mile wide. The\r\nbottom is irregular, sharp, and rocky and has 25 to 30 fathoms. Fishing\r\nhere is mostly by hand line, the ground being said to be too rough for\r\ntrawling. This is a small-boat ground, and fishing is done mainly in the\r\nsummer season. Cod and pollock are taken in the spring, summer, and\r\nfall; haddock are present in spring and fall; and cusk in 35 to 40\r\nfathoms in spring and fall. This is not a hake ground.\r\n\r\nOld Egg Rock. This rock is WSW. from Moosabec Light, 6 miles distant,\r\nand running in a NE. and SW. direction. It is 3 miles long by 1 mile\r\nwide; has a rocky bottom and depths of 25 to 30 fathoms. This is also a\r\nsmall-boat ground, where fishing is done mainly by hand lines, but\r\ntrawls also are employed. This ground is fished by the larger vessels in\r\nthe fall months when the weather is too rough for fishing on the outside\r\ngrounds. Cod, haddock, and a few pollock are taken in spring and fall;\r\nhake in fair number in the fall months.\r\n\r\nMiddle Ridge This is W. by S. from Moosabec Light 3 miles. It lies in a\r\nNE. and SW. direction and is about 1 mile long by ½ mile wide. The\r\ndepths are from 18 to 25 fathoms and the bottom is rough and rocky. It\r\nis a small-boat ground mostly and of little importance as a fishing\r\nground. Cod are present the year around haddock in late spring and\r\nsummer with a smaller number in the fall. Cusk are here the year around.\r\nA few pollock are here in the spring and fall.\r\n\r\nBroken Ground. This lies S by E from Moosabec light, 15 miles, whence\r\nthe ground extends WSW to within 4 miles of Mount Desert Rock with an\r\naverage width of 1 mile. The depths run from 15 to 100 fathoms. The\r\nshallows are sharp and rocky; the deeps, clay and gravel. There are\r\nplaces ½ mile long and others 3 miles long having depths of 70 fathoms.\r\nSeveral of these spots have special names: Crawley's Rocks, Puzzling\r\nRock, The Ridges. The grounds mentioned here and those previously\r\nmentioned are known to the fishermen as the Moosabec Ridges. All these\r\nseem to be fishing spots cropping out upon the 50 fathom curve. On the\r\nBroken Ground the fishing season is from June 1 through September.\r\nHerring usually are abundant here from May to September. Cod are taken\r\noutside of the grounds in spring and fall. Pollock and small cod are\r\ntaken on the shoals in summer and fall, and hake on the mud bottom in\r\nsummer and fall and hake on the mud bottom in summer and fall.\r\n\r\nTibbetts' Ledge. This lies east from Petit Manan 4 or 5 miles. The\r\nmarks are Schoodic Island over Green Island of Petit Manan and the Ladle\r\nover Nash's Island. This ledge consists of two rocky shoals with depths\r\nof 3 to 3½ fathoms, about one acre apiece in extent and 1/4 mile apart\r\nlying NW and SE from each other. To the westward of these is broken\r\nground nearly to Petit Manan. These are favorite small-boat grounds. The\r\neastern ledge drops suddenly into the mud. In May large cod are caught\r\nover the muddy bottom just E of the ledge in 27 to 30 fathoms. Hake and\r\nhaddock are taken in late spring (May) and fall. Fishing is by hand line\r\nand trawl.\r\n\r\nBen's Ground. Lies ESE from Petit Manan 4 or 5 miles. The marks are\r\nPetit Manan Light to northward of Middle Hill of Mount Desert and Humpback\r\nMountain on the west side of Trafton's Island or Pond Island Light to\r\nthe eastward of Jordan's Delight. The ground is circular in shape,\r\nabout 3/4 mile across, having 14 to 30 fathoms of water. The bottom is\r\nof rocks and mud. This ground is of little importance except as a\r\nsmall-boat ground in summer for cod and haddock. Hake are taken on the\r\nmuddy bottom near it, It is a winter haddock ground in calm weather,\r\nthese fish leaving it in the storms, the water being somewhat too\r\nshallow for them to \"ride out a blow\" in comfort, Such at least is the\r\nreason the fishermen give for the sudden cessation of their taking on\r\nshoal grounds after a period of heavy weather.\r\n\r\nSoutheast Rock. This is a ledge, nearly uncovered at low tide on its\r\nshoalest spot, SSE from Petit Manan and 4½ miles distant, The shoal\r\nportions slope toward the NE a distance of 4 miles over an irregular\r\nbottom, Depths vary from 17 to 30 fathoms, The shoals are rocky, and the\r\ndeeps are muddy, Cod and haddock are taken here in May and June, hake\r\nfrom July to September, It is a good lobster ground, also, Fishing here\r\nis by handline and trawl operated from vessels and small boats from\r\nnear-by Maine ports.\r\n\r\nBroken Ridges aka Joe Roy Ground. This lies SSE from Petit Manan 7\r\nmiles to the center. It is 2 miles long NE and SW and one mile wide and\r\nfrom 27 to 33 fathoms, and the bottom of rocks and mud is very uneven,\r\nThe shoalest portion is near the center. It is said to be a good cod and\r\nhaddock ground, and is mainly a small boat ground, although some vessel\r\nfishing is carried on here in the spring.\r\n\r\nBlack Ledges Ground. This ground lies between Jordan's Delight and the\r\nHalibut Ledges, or Black Ledges. It is a good haddock ground for a\r\nbrief season in the spring and early summer when the fish are following\r\nthe herring schools. In general it is a small-boat ground on which\r\nchiefly hand lines and trawls are operated, A few cod and cusk are taken\r\nhere in the fall, and it is a good lobster ground.\r\n\r\nBakers Island Ridge. This is a narrow ledge making out from Bakers\r\nIsland E, by N. The eastern part bears S. by E. from Schoodic Island 3/4\r\nmile distant The ridge is much broken, its average width being ½ mile,\r\nand it has depths of from 20 to 25 fathoms over a rocky and gravelly\r\nbottom. It is not much fished on the shoaler spots, but in 30 to 35\r\nfathoms, on a muddy bottom, hake are abundant from July to October,\r\ninclusive. Cod and cusk are found here in the spring and fall; haddock\r\nfrom October to January, inclusive. Fishing here is done by small boats\r\nand small vessels mainly from Bass Harbor and Southwest Harbor by trawl\r\nand hand line. It is a very good lobster ground.\r\n\r\nMartins Ground; Hillards Reef. The center bears WSW. from Schoodic\r\nPoint, distant 3 miles. It is a rocky patch of 4 or 5 acres and has\r\ndepths of from 15 to 25 fathoms. It is not important except for its\r\nhand-lining for cod and haddock in the spring and fall months and for\r\nhake in the fall. It is a good lobster ground.\r\n\r\nEgg Rock Broken Ground. This is a rocky ridge making out S. by W. from\r\nEgg Rock Ledges and is about 2 miles long by 14 miles wide. It has an\r\nirregular bottom, with depths from 9 to 15 fathoms. This ridge, with\r\nMartins and Seaveys Grounds, divides the western or Bakers Island mud\r\nchannel from Schoodic mud channel. Both these were formerly considered\r\nvery good hake grounds but, while still good, are not as profitable for\r\nhake fishing as in past years. Haddock are taken on the ridge in the\r\nspring and in October, November, and December. A few cod are taken in\r\nthe spring and fall. Fishing is by trawl and hand line. It is a good\r\nlobster ground.\r\n\r\nInner Schoodic Ridge. This ridge bears SE. by S. from Bakers Island,\r\nthe center distant 12 miles. This ground is nearly circular in form,\r\nabout 4 miles in diameter, and has depths running from 18 to 60 fathoms.\r\nThe bottom is of rocks, gravel, and mud; the shoaler portions are sharp\r\nand rocky. Vessels from Maine ports use this ground, fishing by hand\r\nline and trawl. Cod and haddock are abundant here in spring and fall,\r\nand hake fishing is good through the summer. It is a good lobster\r\nground.\r\n\r\nOuter Schoodic Ridge. The northwest part of this ground bears SE. from\r\nBakers Island, from which it is distant 22 miles. It lies 7 miles\r\noutside Inner Schoodic, has long been considered one of the best shore\r\nfishing grounds of the Maine coast, and still seems to deserve the\r\nreputation. The ridge is about 8 miles long in a NE. and SW. direction,\r\nlying nearly parallel with the adjacent coast. Its greatest breadth is 6\r\nmiles. The bottom is broken and irregular and has depths from 22 to 80\r\nfathoms over rocks and gravel on the shoaler parts and mud on the deeps.\r\nPrincipally Maine vessels fish this ground, using hand line and trawl.\r\nCod, pollock, haddock, cusk, and hake are present here from June to\r\nNovember, and a few large halibut, up to 300 pounds in weight, are taken\r\nhere in June and July.\r\n\r\nMount Desert Outer Ridge. This ridge lies SE. by E. from the Big Hill\r\nof Mount Desert Island. From Schoodic Island to the center of this\r\nground is about 25 miles. Its length E. by N. and W. by S, is 2 miles;\r\nits breadth 3/4 mile. Depths are from 45 to 60 fathoms; the shoals are\r\nrocky, but on the sides sand and clay predominate.  This is a\r\ncomparatively small ground, but it furnishes good cod fishing in the\r\nspring (April to July) and fall. Cusk are taken in the spring and fall.\r\nVirtually no haddock are taken here. Hake are found in the deep water on\r\nthe W. and SW. in spring, summer, and fall; trawl lines principally are\r\nused here. It is a good lobster ground but is too distant for present\r\nfishing methods.\r\n\r\nFlat Ground. This ground lies between Mount Desert and Swan Island,\r\nSW. from Long Island. In 50 fathoms, on a hard mud bottom, there is good\r\nfishing for hake in the summer. Fishing is by hand line and trawl.\r\n\r\nEnoch's Shoal. This shoal lies ENE. 3 miles from Great Duck Island.\r\nThis is a small hummock on the outer parts of a ridge extending out to\r\nit from Great Duck island. It has a sharp, rocky bottom with depths of\r\nabout 18 fathoms. Hand lining and trawling are the methods employed to\r\ntake a few cod in early spring; haddock are here in small numbers in the\r\nsummer as well as a small quantity of hake. It is a good lobster ground.\r\n\r\nBanks Ground. The center bears SE. by S. from Great Duck Island,\r\ndistant about 5 miles. It is about 1½ miles long in a NE. and SW.\r\ndirection by 1/4 mile wide and has a mud bottom with depths from 35 to\r\n50 fathoms. It is mainly a small-boat ground, fished mostly in the\r\nsummer, when hake are fairly abundant and there are a few haddock and\r\ncod. It is a lobster ground, also.\r\n\r\nShell Ground. This lies SE. from Long island Head, from which the\r\ncenter of the ground is distant 6 miles. It is 2 miles long, in a NE.\r\nand SW. direction and about ½ mile wide. In the middle portion is a\r\nshoal of 25 fathoms, its bottom sharp rocks. On all sides of this shoal\r\nthe bottom is quite irregular, consisting of pebbles and mud. The\r\ngreatest depth, near the edge of the bank, is 50 fathoms. Cod and\r\nhaddock, together with a few cusk and pollock, are taken here in June,\r\nJuly, and August and even into the late fall, but it is mainly a hake\r\nfishing ground for small boats and an occasional larger craft, all using\r\nhand line and trawl. It is a good lobster ground.\r\n\r\nAbner Ground. This ground is SSE. from Gott's Island, distant 8 miles.\r\nIt extends 1½ miles in a NE. and SW. direction and is about 1/4 mile\r\nwide. The bottom is broken, rocks and mud, with depths of from 25 to 50\r\nfathoms. This is principally a haddock ground, the best season being in\r\nJuly and August, and is resorted to mostly by small craft.\r\n\r\nGrumpy. Extends from SE. 4½ miles from Eastern Ear of Isle au Haute to\r\nSE. 1/4 E. from the western head of Isle au Haute, distant 7 miles. This\r\nground is 2½ miles long by 3/4 mile wide and has a small shoal of 14\r\nfathoms on the northeast part. Over the rest of the ground the average\r\ndepths run from 35 to 40 fathoms over a gravelly bottom. Though not of\r\ngreat importance of late years, this was formerly considered one of the\r\nbest inshore grounds for cod for the entire year and for haddock in\r\nwinter. Hake usually are abundant just off the southeast edge in summer.\r\nThis bank is mostly fished by craft from ports of eastern Maine--small\r\nboats as a rule--and the principal method is by trawling, although\r\nthere is considerable hand-lining for cod in 25 fathoms in June and\r\nJuly. Marks: Big Camden Mountain over the Eastern Ear of Isle au Haute;\r\nFog Island in Jericho Bay, touching on the eastern part of Big Spoon\r\nIsland; Brimstone between Isle au Haute and the Western Ear.\r\n\r\nHatchell Ground. This ground lies SE. by E 3/4 E. 9½ miles from the\r\nwestern head of Isle au Haute. Marks are eastern Mount Desert Hill in\r\nthe Middle Saddle of Long island, and Little Spoon Island in the great\r\nor center Saddle of Isle au Haute.\r\n\r\nBlue Hill Ground. This ground lies approximately E: by S. ¾ S from the\r\nwestern head of Isle au Haute, distant 7 miles. The bottom consists of\r\ngravel and pebbles. Marks: Brimstone Island out by the western head of\r\nIsle au Haute and Blue Hill on the west side of Marshall Island. These\r\nmarks lead to a depth of 25 fathoms on the northeast part of the ground,\r\ndeepening southwest to 40 fathoms in 1 mile from the shoaler part, which\r\nis about ½ mile wide, part of the ground, deepening southwest to 40\r\nfathoms in 1 mile from the shoaler part, which is about ½ mile wide.\r\nThis is a good ground for cod in the spring and fall but is best for\r\nhaddock during the entire winter. Hand lines and trawl are used.\r\n\r\nInner Horse Reef. This reef lies SE. ¾ E 1½ miles from the eastern ear\r\nof isle au Haute. There is a shoal here of 25 fathoms about 1/8 mile in\r\ndiameter. From this the water gradually deepens to NE. for ½ mile, where\r\nit drops off into the mud. Depths on this northeast portion are about 35\r\nfathoms. The bottom is of pebbles and gravel. In spring and fall this is\r\na good cod ground. Hake are found close to the edge in summer. Fishing\r\nis by small craft, generally, using trawl and handline. It is a good\r\nlobster ground. Marks: Bring Blue Hill Mountain in the saddle of White\r\nHorse; Brimstone showing between Western Ear and Isle au Haute.\r\n\r\nOuter Horse Reef. This is a short distance SW. from the Inner Reef,\r\nwith only a narrow gully between. The small shoal falls off rapidly on\r\nall sides. It has a depths of 30 fathoms. Over a space 1/4 mile in\r\ndiameter the bottom is gravelly. Seasons and species are as on Inner\r\nHorse Reef.\r\n\r\nHake Ground. North of Monhegan island lies a patch called the Hake\r\nGround or Mud Channel, the first name because of the abundance of hake\r\ntaken here during June, July, and August. It extends from just outside\r\nWhite Head to abreast of Monhegan Island on the northern side. The\r\ndepths vary from 20 to 45 fathoms, and the ground is still considered\r\none of the best hake grounds alongshore. It is fished by small boats and\r\nvessels when the dogfish are on the outer grounds. This is a good\r\nhaddock ground in December and January, as well as a good lobster\r\nground.\r\n\r\nSouthwest Ground. This lies 2 miles SW. from the western head of Isle\r\nau Haute. It is circular in form, ½ mile in diameter and has a gravelly\r\nbottom with depths varying from 35 to 40 fathoms. It is a cod ground\r\nfrom April to June and from September to November, inclusive. A few\r\npollock and haddock are taken with the cod. Hake are abundant in summer\r\nclose to Isle au Haute. Handlines and trawls are used in the fishing. It\r\nis also a good lobster ground.\r\n\r\nBarley Hill Ground. This ground lies NNE. from Seal Island and SSW from\r\nthe western head of Isle au Haute directly in line between the two,\r\nabout 3½ miles distant from each point. It is circular in form, has 28\r\nto 30 fathoms of water, and the bottom is mixed mud and rocks. This is a\r\nground much resorted to by sloops and larger vessels, and the fishing is\r\nby hand line and trawls. It is a good cod ground in spring and fall and\r\na hake ground on the mud and rocks in summer. Occasionally a few halibut\r\nare taken here during June and July. It is also a lobster ground.\r\n\r\nGilkey Ground. This bears S. from the western head of Isle au Haute.\r\n4 miles distant. It extends ENE. and WSW about 1½ miles long by 1/3 mile\r\nwide. The bottom is rocky on the shoals where depths are about 23\r\nfathoms sloping to 35 fathoms on the southwest part., where the bottom\r\nis gravelly and comparatively smooth.\r\n\r\nThis is a cod ground in spring and fall, a haddock ground in winter, and\r\nhake are taken on the edges in summer. Vessels fishing here are mostly\r\nfrom Maine ports. It is also a good lobster ground.\r\n\r\nRock Cod Ledge. This ledge lies NE. of Seal Island 1 mile. It has a\r\ndepth of 3½ fathoms on the shoalest part, deepening gradually on all\r\nsides for a considerable distance. The bottom is of sharp rocks and is\r\nbroken in places. Rock cod area present in fair numbers in spring and\r\nfall, and this is a mackerel and herring ground in their seasons.\r\nHaddock are abundant in the fall close in to the rocks of Seal Island in\r\n6 to 15 fathoms. This is not a hake ground, although there are a few\r\ncusk to be had here on the deeper parts and an occasional small halibut\r\nis taken in the kelp on the shoal in June and July. It is a good lobster\r\nground.\r\n\r\nGravel Bottom and Southeast Ground. These lie S. of Seal Island.\r\nforming an extensive piece of fairly level ground extensive piece of\r\nfairly level ground. The western that bears a little E. of S. and the\r\neastern part about ESE. from the island. It is about 5 or 10 miles in\r\ndiameter. While this is really but one piece of ground, the eastern part\r\nis called the Southeast Ground and the western part, from the nature of\r\nits bottom.\r\n\r\nThe Gravel Bottom. The eastern portion is muddy and has 40\r\nto 60 fathoms. The western has 35 to 40 fathoms. It is a good cod\r\nground in winter and spring. Haddock are present from November to March,\r\ninclusive; hake in summer. Fishing is done mainly by trawling by sloops\r\nand vessels.\r\n\r\nLaisdells Ground. This is a small, rocky spot outside the Brandy\r\nLedges. It is about 1/4 acre in extent and has a sharp rocky bottom with\r\n20 fathoms of water over it. It is the best cod and haddock ground in\r\nIsle au Haute Bay. This is chiefly a small boat ground and is also a\r\nlobster ground.\r\n\r\nSaddleback Reef. This reef lies S. from Saddle-back Ledge, 3/4 mile\r\ndistant. It is about 2/3 mile long N and S by 1/4 mile wide. Depths are\r\nfrom 15 to 35 fathoms over a broken and rocky bottom. Cod are taken\r\nhere by hand line in May and June; haddock and cod by trawling in fall\r\nand winter (November to January 1). It is a good lobster ground and\r\nchiefly a small-boat ground.\r\n\r\nOtter Island Reef; Snipper Shin; Western Reef. These are names applied\r\nto different sections of an irregular, broken piece of rocky ground\r\nabout halfway between Vinalhaven and Seal Island. Otter Island Reef is\r\nthe eastern section, lying 4 miles W. by S. by 1/4 S. from the western\r\nhead of Isle au Haute. Depths here are from 10 to 25 fathoms over a\r\nrocky bottom. The trawl, formerly not much used here, is now in general\r\nuse. This is a cod and haddock ground at seasons when these fish are in\r\nshoal water, but it is best for cod in winter and spring and for haddock\r\nin the fall, from November 1 to January 1.\r\n\r\nOld Ripper. This lies S. from the Western Ground (Western Reef) and 10\r\nmiles WSW. from Criehaven or Ragged Island. Apparently this is a part of\r\nthe Western Ground. On the deep-water mud bottom between these (Ripper\r\nand Western Reef) is good hake fishing in summer, and cusk are abundant\r\nfrom May to the time when the dogfish strike the ground, usually about\r\nJuly 5 to 10.\r\n\r\nCrie Ridges. These lie 4 miles NW. from Matinicus Rock, 4 miles WSW.\r\nfrom Criehaven or Ragged Island, and run SE. from Western Ground toward\r\nMatinicus, distant 4½ to 5 miles. Cod, pollock, and cusk are here in\r\nthe spring, and haddock are abundant in the fall.\r\n\r\nBald Ridges. These begin just outside Wooden Ball Island and run off\r\nin a nearly direct line for Matinicus Rock. They are each from 1/4 to ½\r\nmile wide, are quite close together, the distances between them being\r\nnot over ½ mile, and they are almost parallel with each other. Soundings\r\nshow from 15 to 30 fathoms upon them, with a broken, rocky bottom. The\r\nshoalest water is about 1 mile from Wooden Ball Island, the depth\r\nincreasing toward the southern end.\r\n\r\nThis is a good cod ground at all times when the fish are on the coast,\r\nthe spring school being the largest. The shoal is a favorite place for\r\nrock cod. Haddock are present from January 1 to February 15. Hake are\r\nabundant in their season on the mud bottom inside the Bald Ridges 1½\r\nmiles WSW, in 50 fathoms. It is a good lobster ground.\r\n\r\nHenry Marshalls Ground. This ground lies S. by W. from Matinicus Rock\r\nabout 3 miles; its area is about 2 acres. The shoaler portion has a\r\ndepth of 35 fathoms and a gravelly bottom; on the edge the depth is 45\r\nfathoms and the bottom is of rocks and mud. Cod are taken here in the\r\nspring, haddock in January and February, and hake in the summer months.\r\nIt is a good lobster ground.\r\n\r\nThe Bounties (The Bowdies). This ground bears SE. by S ½ S distant 6\r\nmiles from Wooden Ball Island. It is nearly circular in form, about 4\r\nmiles across, and has depths from 40 to 60 fathoms. The bottom, of\r\ngravel and rocks, is somewhat broken. It is a good cod and cusk ground\r\nin spring and fall and a haddock ground in winter and is fished by\r\nvessels and sloops, mainly by trawling but with a certain amount of hand\r\nlining, in May and June.  A summer hake ground extends from 3 miles\r\nESE. of Seal Island to 4 miles SSE of the Wooden Ball, thus it is about\r\n7½ miles long by some 2½ miles wide. The depths here are from 35 to 60\r\nfathoms.\r\n\r\nSummer Hake Ground. A summer hake ground extends from 8 miles SE. of\r\nthe eastern Ear of Isle au Haute to 3 miles SE. of Long Island in 35 to\r\n60 fathoms on a bottom of hard mud. This piece of ground is about 15\r\nmiles long by 4 miles wide.\r\n\r\nMinerva Hub. This bears SSE. from Matinicus Rock, distant 6 miles. This\r\nis a small, gravelly spot about 1/4 mile in diameter and with a depth of\r\n35 fathoms, abounding with cod in spring and fall. It is a summer ground\r\nfor hake and cusk. Hand lines and trawls are used.\r\n\r\nHaddock Nubble. This lies SE. ½ S. from Matinicus Rock, distant 16\r\nmiles, and has an average depth of 50 fathoms over a small, circular\r\npatch some 2,000 feet across. The bottom is of gravel and rocks, and\r\n\"lemons\" and marine growths of like nature are abundant. This is a June\r\ncod ground, usually furnishing good haddocking, also, from November to\r\nJanuary, inclusive.\r\n\r\nSkate Bank. This bank bears SSE. from Matinicus Rock, distant 12\r\nmiles. It is about 2 miles in diameter and nearly circular in form.\r\nDepths are from 35 to 60 fathoms. The bottom is gravelly but quite\r\nuneven. The best season on this ground for cod and cusk is from April\r\nto July. Hake abound in July and August. Hand lines and trawls are used\r\nhere, fished by sloops and vessels.\r\n\r\nMatinicus Sou'Sou'West Grounds. These grounds bear SSW. from Matinicus\r\nRock, from which the inner edge of the grounds is distant 6 miles. They\r\nextend about 9 miles N. and S. and have about the same width, being\r\nnearly triangular in shape, broadest at the northern end. On the\r\nnorthern part there is a shoal of about 30 fathoms 2 miles long E. and\r\nW. and 1 mile wide. Sharp rocks cover this, but the ground is not broken\r\nand drops off gradually to depths of 50 to 55 fathoms or even to 60\r\nfathoms on the southern part. Outside of the shoal the bottom is pebbly\r\nand gravelly. This is one of the best cod and haddock grounds in the\r\nvicinity. Cod are sometimes abundant here all winter; haddock are found\r\nhere from December 1 to February and are more abundant than the cod.\r\nHake are plentiful on this ground and in 60 fathoms on the mud off the\r\nedge SE. of this ground during the summer season. Marks: The high\r\npinnacle on the eastern end of Wooden Ball, showing just out by\r\nMatinicus Rock, SW. by S. from the rock, 5 miles.\r\n\r\nInner Breaker. This lies 2 miles W. of the southwest point of\r\nMatinicus Island. It is a rocky shoal about 1 acre in extent and having\r\n7 fathoms of water. From this shoal the bottom slopes gradually to\r\ndepths of 25 to 30 fathoms, and this slope furnishes good fishing for\r\ncod in May and June, while haddock are here in December and January. A\r\ngood school of hake is found on the edge of the ground in summer. The\r\nbottom is rocky and broken and, while sharp, is fished with trawls as\r\nwell as hand lines. It is mostly a small-boat ground.\r\n\r\nTowhead Grounds. These grounds hear N. by E. ½ E. from Matinicus\r\nIsland, from which they are distant 2½ miles. Depths are from 12 to 30\r\nfathoms. It is somewhat irregular in shape and has a very rocky, broken\r\nbottom. The ground is from 2½ to 3 miles long and ½ to 1½ miles wide.\r\nIt extends E. by S. and W. by N. and is considered one of the best\r\ninside shoal grounds for cod and haddock in the bay. Hand lines and\r\ntrawls are used here now, although in former times this and the\r\npreceding grounds were considered too sharp for the use of trawls. Both\r\nthese are good lobster grounds and chiefly small-boat grounds.\r\n\r\nGreen Island Ridge (or Western Ridge) and the Pigeon Ground. The\r\nnorthern portion of this ridge lies 6½ miles NW. by W. from Matinicus\r\nRock, from which the ground extends about 7 miles in a SSW. direction.\r\nThe greatest width is not over 1 mile. Depths are from 15 to 30 fathoms.\r\nThe bottom is broken and rocky. It is a good cod ground in the spring\r\nand fall. Haddock are found here in June, November, and December. In\r\nsummer this is a good hake ground. Halibut are found on the shoals (10\r\nfathoms) and about the northern part of Western Green Island, on the\r\nsandy bottom during June and July.\r\n\r\nMatinic Bank. This is an extension of the shore soundings that make out\r\nto the southward and eastward of Matinic a distance of 2 or 3 miles,\r\nwith depths (outside of 1½ miles) of 23 to 30 fathoms. The bottom is\r\nlevel, consisting of rocks, pebbles, and gravel, and the ground abounds\r\nin cod in the season from March to June. Just off the edge, in depths of\r\nfrom 40 to 50 fathoms, the bottom is soft mud, on which hake abound in\r\nsummer. Very few haddock are taken on this bank. Halibut are sometimes\r\nabundant here in 10 to 15 fathoms during May and June.\r\n\r\nMatinic Ooze. This is a flat bottom, composed of ooze and shells, that\r\nmakes off to the eastward of the Haddock Ledge and Shoal and bears about\r\nS. from Matinic. The Haddock Shoal and the Ooze are really parts of one\r\nground, though they have been given different names by the fishermen.\r\nThe Haddock Shoal (3 miles S. by B. from the Seal Ledge: breaks in rough\r\nweather) is thought to be poor ground and is but little fished, although\r\nit is a fall haddock ground. The Ooze falls off gradually, reaching a\r\ndepth of 50 fathoms on the outer part. It is considered fair fishing\r\nground for cod and haddock in the spring and for cod and hake in the\r\nsummer and fall.\r\n\r\nFreemans Ground. This ground lies 6½ miles E. from Monhegan Island\r\nbetween Ornes Ground and Matinicus Western Ground. It is 3 miles long\r\nand 1 mile wide and runs in a NE. and SW. direction. There is a shoal on\r\nthe southwest part having 20 fathoms over a sharp rocky bottom. The rest\r\nof the ground has depths of 25 to 40 fathoms, the bottom of rocks,\r\ngravel, and shells, in some places uneven and in others smooth. This is\r\na good spring ground for cod and for cod, hake, and pollock in the fall.\r\nHaddock are not numerous on this ground, though a few are usually to be\r\nfound here in December. Herring are here May to August.\r\n\r\nMiddle Shoal, Pollock Rip, Allens Shoal, and Deckers Shoal. These are\r\nsmall rocky patches lying to eastward of Monhegan Island and northerly\r\nfrom the Outer Shoal. They have depths from 6 to 30 fathoms over a\r\nsharp, rocky, and broken bottom. Middle Shoal is 2 miles from the\r\nisland. Pollock Rip 1½ miles. Allens Shoal 1 1/4 miles, having 5½\r\nfathoms and breaking in rough weather; and Deckers Shoal 1 mile. Depths\r\nvary here from 6 to 30 fathoms over a bottom generally sharp and rocky.\r\nThe principal fishing here is hand-lining for cod in the spring during\r\nthe herring season and in the fall in \"squid time\". A few pollock are\r\ntaken here also.\r\n\r\nA number of small patches lie westerly from the Outer Shoal and close to\r\nMonhegan Island. These are the Cusk Ground with a depth of 20 to 35\r\nfathoms; Gull Rock Ledge (breaks in rough weather) 3½ fathoms;\r\nLobster Point Ground, 15 to 30 fathoms; Inner Spring Ground, 15 to 30\r\nfathoms; Outer Spring Ground 25 to 30 fathoms. All these are fished for\r\ncod nearly all the year, for haddock in December and January, and for\r\npollock in early spring and late fall. The Spring Grounds are near the\r\nharbor and so are fished before the others. All are lobster grounds.\r\nSmall boats and vessels operate here.\r\n\r\nBlack Island Ground. This ground is ENE. 2 miles from Monhegan. 1 mile\r\nin diameter, has a shoal of 10 fathoms, and sharp rocky bottom in the\r\ncenter. The ground slopes gradually from this to the edges, where are 40\r\nfathoms. Beyond the depths of 28 to 30 fathoms the bottom is gravelly\r\nand smoother. This is a cod ground in spring, and cod and hake are taken\r\nhere on the edges in summer and fall. Pollock are found about the shoal\r\nin summer. It is a good lobster ground.\r\n\r\nFranklin Ground. This ground is NE. by N. midway between Monhegan and\r\nBurnt Island, distant 4 miles. Cod and haddock are found here from April\r\nto June and pollock in summer. In summer and fall hake are taken by\r\nnight fishing with hand line about the rocks in 20 to 30 fathoms on the\r\nbroken ground. Fishing here is by hand-lining in summer and trawling in\r\nfall and winter. It is a lobster ground.\r\n\r\nWhite Head Ground.  Depths on the shoal (the White Hub: Bring Budd\r\ncottage out by White Head, Black Head. and Allens Island touching) are 7\r\nfathoms, thence to 20 fathoms on the edges about it. This ground extends\r\nNE. and SW., 2 miles long by 1/4 mile wide. The bottom is chiefly\r\nbroken, of rocks, and with spots of coarse gravel and sand. Fish and\r\ntheir seasons are as on Franklin Ground. Marks: Bring Black Head, White\r\nHead, and Gull Head in range on the east side of Monhegan Island.\r\n\r\nBurnt Island, Inner Ridge aka Andrews Shoal. This is NE. by E. from\r\nMonhegan, distant 5 miles. It is a broken ground with depths from 15 to\r\n20 fathoms, the bottom rocky and gravelly, with occasional mud holes. It\r\nextends NE. about 4 miles, nearly to Roaring Bull Ledge, and is ½ mile\r\nwide. There are strong tidal currents here, the flood being NE., the ebb\r\nSW. It is a cod ground from April to June, and cod and hake are taken\r\nfrom September to November; haddock in December. It is a good lobster\r\nground.\r\n\r\nBurnt Island, Outer Ridge. This ground is parallel with the Inner\r\nRidge and at a distance of 3/4 mile. Depths are from 5 to 25 fathoms,\r\nthe bottom being rather less broken than on the Inner Ridge. Fishing\r\nseasons and species are as on Inner Ridge. Hand-lining is done mostly\r\nbecause of strong tides. It is a good lobster ground.\r\n\r\nOrnes Ground. This ground bears E., distant 4½ miles from Monhegan\r\nLight to the center. It is 1 mile long. E. and W. and 1 mile wide.\r\nDepths are from 30 to 45 fathoms. On the shoal parts the bottom is of\r\nsharp rocks and broken. On other parts it is generally pebbly and quite\r\nlevel. The shoal lies toward the eastern part of the ground and is a\r\ngood spring cod ground; also a pollock ground in the spring and fall. It\r\nis a night fishing ground for hake, by hand lining close to the rocks\r\nduring September and October. Herring are abundant here usually in May\r\nand June. It is a good lobster ground. Fishing is done by hand lines and\r\ntrawls.\r\n\r\nOuter Shoal. This ground is ESE from Monhegan Light about 2½ miles. It\r\nis circular in form and about 1½ miles across. Depths are from 10 to 38\r\nfathoms. There is a small rocky shoal in the center of the ground; the\r\nremainder of this piece has a gravelly bottom. This is a cod ground from\r\nspring to fall and a good pollock ground in September. A few haddock are\r\ntaken here about the edges in December. Hake are abundant on the edges\r\non the mud in 45 to 50 fathoms during the spring, summer and fall.\r\n\r\nMonhegan Inner Sou'Southeast Ground. This ground is SSE from Monhegan\r\nLight. It is circular in form and 1/14 miles across. The center is 5\r\nmiles fro the light. Depths are from 30 to 50 fathoms, the shoalest\r\nwater being on the eastern part, the shoal has a broken and rocky\r\nbottom, but the rest of the ground is gravelly and muddy. The principal\r\nfishes taken are cod and cusk in the spring, summer and fall. Very few\r\nhaddock are found here. Pollock are numerous in the fall, when they are\r\ntaken by hand lining. Hake are abundant in September and October. June\r\nis the best fishing month, except when the squid strike the ground in\r\nthe fall. This is mainly a small boat ground, fished by trawls, hand\r\nlines and an increasing number of gill nets.\r\n\r\nMonhegan Outer Sou'Southeast. Three miles outside the Inner Ground on\r\nthe same bearing and similar in size and form. The bottom is rocky and\r\nmuddy or of hard clay. The depths are from 35 to 55 fathoms. The same\r\nspecies are found here as on Inner Sou'Southeast and at the same\r\nseasons, and in addition, hand lining is done for cod in August and\r\nSeptember.\r\n\r\nBlue Ground. This is SE 1½ E from Monhegan, distant 14 miles; E 1½ S\r\nfrom Portland Lightship 45 miles, and SW from Matinicus Rock 9 miles to\r\nsouthern Edge. Fishermen usually take the Monhegan bearing [12] for their\r\nstarting point. This ground has a small shoal in the center, having 28\r\nto 30 fathoms, from which the bottom slopes off to 45 and 60 fathoms on\r\nthe edges. The shoal is broken and rocky, bu the deep water is over a\r\nlevel gravelly bottom. This ground is circular in form and about 2 miles\r\nacross. It is both a small-boat and vessel ground, larger craft\r\noperating here mainly in the fall. Hake are found here in large numbers\r\nin summer and fall; cusk are taken in the deep water the year around but\r\nare most abundant in January. Cod are here the year around, the largest\r\nschool occurring in February and March.\r\n\r\nMonhegan Southeast Ground. This ground lies SE from Monhegan Island,\r\nthe center distant 12 miles. This is nearly circular, 3 miles in\r\ndiameter. The bottom is so broken that depths may vary much within a\r\nshort distance, but depths are from 35 to 75 fathoms over a bottom of\r\nrocks, gravel and mud. Fishing is by trawl and handline. It is good cod\r\nground from April to July; haddock are taken in December and hake in\r\nsummer on the edges in 50 to 60 fathoms.\r\n\r\nHill Ground. This ground is SSW 9 miles from Matinic: between 3 and 4\r\nmiles long NE and SW and some 2 miles wide. The shoalest part has 35\r\nfathoms and a rocky bottom. From this it slopes gradually to a depth of\r\n50 fathoms over a bottom of mixed gravel, rocks and mud. Its best\r\nfishing is for hake, using both hand lines and trawls.\r\n\r\nMonhegan Inner Sou'Sou'west Ground. this ground takes its name from its\r\nbearing, lying SSW from Monhegan light, distant 5 miles. Its width is\r\n1½ miles, its length NNE and SSW is 1 1/4 miles. It has a sharp, broken,\r\nrocky bottom, including a small shoal of 20 fathoms and some hummocks of\r\nrather greater depths. The deepest water is in the neighborhood of 50\r\nfathoms. Fishing here is from May until July for codfish and pollock:\r\nhake and cusk are in the deep water in the spring months and halibut on\r\nthe shoal in July and September. This ground is principally fished by\r\ntrawls, but there is considerable hand lining in September and October.\r\nGillnetting, too, has become more common of later years.\r\n\r\nHarris Ground. From 15 miles S ½ W from Monhegan island to 6 miles\r\nSSW. It has 40 to 50 fathoms over a bottom of sharp rocks and mud--a\r\n\"blistery\" bottom. Cod, cusk and hake are found here the year around.\r\nHalibut are here in June, July and August. Fishing is by trawling and\r\nhand lining, with very little gillnetting.\r\n\r\nThe 45 Fathom Bunch. Sixteen miles S 1½ E from Monhegan. This is a\r\ngreat ground for June hand lining for cod. Thence 1 mile ENE to 70\r\nfathom depth, which leads to a piece of ground leading to the Inner\r\nFall, on which, on a hard bottom and mud where there is an abundance of\r\n\"lemons\" and similar forms, are found cod cusk and pollock in June. The\r\nground is about 6 miles long, WSW and ENE by 1 mile wide.\r\n\r\nAnother Forty Five Fathom Bunch lies 22 miles S ½ E from Monhegan. This\r\nground is 4 miles long by 1 mile wide, running ENE and WSW, and has\r\ndepths from 45 to 75 fathoms. This is likewise a great cod hand lining\r\nground in June.\r\n\r\nAnother of the same name lies 26 miles S 1½ E from Monhegan. It has a\r\n49 fathom shoal and the species and seasons are much the same as on the\r\nother grounds of the name. This is probably the ground known to other\r\nvessel captains as Toothaker Ridge.\r\n\r\nMonhegan Outer Sou'Sou'West. This ground is SSW from Monhegan Light.\r\nthe center distant 9 miles It is 4 miles long, NNE and SSW and about 2\r\nmiles wide, and has 45 fathoms on the shoalest part but the depths\r\ngenerally are from 60 to 80 fathoms. The bottom generally is gravelly\r\nand quite level. The ground is fished by both boats and vessels using\r\nhand lines and trawls.\r\n\r\nThis is a cod ground in spring and fall. In summer hake are abundant\r\nhere, and halibut are quite plentiful in July on the shoalest part.\r\n\r\nOld Jeffrey. An exceedingly good ground. It is said that better\r\nfishing may be had here than on any other ground of its size in the\r\nvicinity. This piece of bottom bears SE from Pumpkin Rock, from which\r\nthe center is distant about 6 miles. It is about 3 miles long NE and SW,\r\nand about 1 mile wide. The bottom is broken, of gravel and mud, with\r\ndepths from 25 to 50 fathoms. Fishing here is by trawling and\r\nland-lining. In spring cod are most abundant, in late summer and fall\r\nhake, cod, and pollock are taken. Halibut are found on the shoaler parts\r\nin July.\r\n\r\nLittle Jeffrey. A small piece of broken, rocky bottom, roughly\r\ncircular in form. Depths average 35 fathoms. Species and seasons are as\r\non Old Jeffrey, from which it lies about 4 miles NE by E.\r\n\r\nMonhegan Western Ground. This is a somewhat extensive ground lying\r\nabout 4½ miles WSW from Monhegan Island. The depths range from 22 to 45\r\nfathoms. Its length is 4 or 5 miles, and its greatest breadth is 2 miles\r\non the eastern portion, gradually narrowing westward to about 1 mile.\r\nThe ground runs SE and NW. Pollock are found here in September and\r\nOctober. It is fished by hand lines, trawls and gill nets. Marks: Bring\r\nhouses on New Harbor over the white cliff on Pemaquid 6 miles from New\r\nHarbor.\r\n\r\nBroken Ground. The center bears nearly S. from Pumpkin Island (at\r\nentrance to Boothbay Harbor), distant 7 miles. It extends 4 miles in an\r\nENE. and WSW direction and has an average width of 1¾ miles. Depths are\r\nfrom 35 to 50 fathoms on a bottom of rocks and mud. Cod are taken here\r\nthe year around; hake from June to September. Cusk also are found here\r\nall the year in 40 fathoms depths. It is fair herring ground on spring\r\nnights.\r\n\r\nGreat Ledge. Ten miles S. from Cape Newagen. It is about 4 miles long,\r\nSSW. and NNE and from 1 to 2 miles wide. There is said to be a shoal of\r\n14 fathoms on the northern edge and another of 22 fathoms near the\r\ncenter. These are both broken and rocky, but the main part of the\r\nground, having depths of 30 to 45 fathoms, is mostly composed of sand.\r\nis quite level, and slopes gradually toward the edge. It is a good\r\nground for cod and haddock in winter and for cod in the spring. A few\r\npollock are taken here, also. Halibut are found on the shoals in July.\r\nOn these, also, are good lobster grounds. It is chiefly a small-boat and\r\nvessel ground, fishing being done by hand lines and trawls, with some\r\ngill netting. Marks: Show the sawtooth of Morse's Mountain coming out by\r\nSeguin on the western side; hold this until Pumpkin Island comes onto\r\nWhite Island.\r\n\r\nBarnum Head Grounds. These lie SSE. from Damariscove Island and are\r\nabout 1 mile long by 400 yards wide. Depths are from 40 to 70 fathoms\r\nover broken ground of sharp rocks on the shoals, with mud on the deeper\r\nparts. This ground is fished by hand lines, gill nets, and trawls mainly\r\nby boats and small craft. Cod, haddock, and pollock are found here in\r\nthe spring and fall months: hake in the muddy parts in summer. It is a\r\nsummer hand-line ground for cod and pollock also. Marks: Bring the peak\r\nof Heron Island on Damariscove and the \"Whistler\" on Seguin, 7 miles\r\nfrom Damariscove Island (this gives 21-fathom soundings) or Big White\r\nIsland's inner part just touching on Barnum Head; Morse Mountain (in\r\nKennebec) touching on eastern part of Seguin to make a sawtooth.\r\n\r\nPeterson's Ground. Lies distant SW. from Monhegan 20 miles and SSE.\r\nfrom Seguin 16 miles. This is about 3 miles long in an ENE. and WSW.\r\ndirection by about 1½ miles wide. The northern and western edges rise\r\nsharply from the 85 or 90 fathoms of the muddy bottom about it to 60\r\nfathoms over a bottom of rocks and stones. Easterly and southerly the\r\nground slopes away gradually over hard gravel to 90 fathoms. Cod and\r\nhake furnish the best fishing here--at its peak during October and\r\nNovember.\r\n\r\nCusk Ridge. It lies S. ½ E. 12 miles from Pumpkin Island, 3½ to 4 miles\r\nlong, NE. and SW., and 1/4 mile wide. This ground is somewhat difficult\r\nto find. It has a bottom of black gravel and rocks with 30 to 60 fathoms\r\nof water over it. A \"blistery\" bottom that is a cod ground the year\r\naround, the best of the fishing occurring in the spring months. Hake are\r\nabundant in the fall, and cusk fishing is exceptionally good in the deep\r\nwater in June.\r\n\r\nPotato Patch. Three miles WNW. from Monhegan. A round nubble about 14\r\nmile in diameter, of sharp, rocky bottom having about 40 fathoms over\r\nit. Cusk and cod are taken on the shoal and hake from the muddy edges\r\nabout it.\r\n\r\nThe Apron. Four and one-half miles from Monhegan. Marks are the tripod\r\non Eastern Egg Rock over Franklin Island Light; Monhegan Light over the\r\nmiddle of Manana. Its length is 5 miles and its width 3 miles. It is a\r\nbroken piece of ground with 10 to 45 fathoms. Cod are present the year\r\naround and haddock all the year except for a few weeks in summer. Cusk\r\nare here most of the year, but the season for pollock is September.\r\n\r\nHenry Gallant Ridges. The inner one lies 16½ miles S. by E. of\r\nMonhegan Island, extending in a NNE. and SSW. direction, about 1 mile\r\nlong by 1/4 mile wide. The outer ridge lies about 1¼ miles farther from\r\nthe island on the same bearing as the first and paralleling it and\r\napparently is about the same size. The bottom on both shoals is of\r\ngravel and black rocks with depths averaging 45 fathoms but rising from\r\nthe 80 and 90 fathoms of the surrounding muddy ground. Both these are\r\nyear-around cod grounds, the spring months, however, having The largest\r\nschool. Cusk also are abundant on both shoals in the spring.\r\n\r\nMosers Ledge, also known as Middle Ground. This piece of shoal ground\r\nlies about midway between Monhegan Island and Pemaquid and has a\r\n3-fathom shoal on the eastern part where the sea breaks in heavy\r\nweather. This shoal, called Mosers Ledge, is broken and rocky but slopes\r\ngradually to the SW., reaching 48 fathoms, with a bottom of gravel and\r\nmud on the deepest part. The ground is about 2 miles long NE. and SW.\r\nand about 1 mile wide. It is good ground for cod and haddock in the\r\nspring and for herring in June and other top-schooling fish In their\r\nseason. Mackerel occur in late August and September. It is a lobster\r\nground the year around.\r\n\r\nJohns Head Ground. About 4 miles SSE. from Pemaquid Point. Depths are\r\nfrom 25 to 15 fathoms over a sandy bottom, making a good cod ground in\r\nApril and May. The ground is of circular form about 1 mile in diameter.\r\nHand lines and trawls, together with some gill nets, are used on the\r\nsand shoal.\r\n\r\nWhite Island Ground. This is ESE from White Island, from which its\r\ninner edge is distant ¼ mile and the outer edge about 4 miles. Of\r\ntriangular outline, it is widest at the outer end. It is very broken and\r\nuneven and has depths from 6 to 30 fathoms. In some places the bottom is\r\ngravelly, but on the shoal it is sharp, broken rocks. The small, rocky\r\nspots are known by other names, such as Browns Head Ground (a herring\r\nground in June), where the fishermen catch a few rock cod. The sandy\r\nbottom furnishes good fares of haddock in May and June. \"Bobber\r\ntrawling\" is the usual method used here in June. This ground is fished\r\nmainly by small boats and sloops using hand lines and trawls.\r\n\r\nSteamboat Ground. Seven miles WSW. from Monhegan Island; it is 3 miles\r\nlong, NE. and SW, and ½ mile wide. Its bottom is broken with patches of\r\nrocks. Depths are from 25 to 50 fathoms, the shoalest 20 fathoms. This\r\nis fished by hand lines and trawls mainly by craft from New Harbor. Cod\r\nare found here the year around but are most abundant in the fall.\r\nHaddock are present all the spring and fall; hake through the summer\r\nmonths; pollock in the fall. Cusk are most abundant in the spring. A\r\ncertain amount of lobster fishing is done here.\r\n\r\nInner and Outer Boutens (Bootlegs). The inner ground lies 3 miles SW.\r\nfrom Monhegan Island. It is about 1 mile long. NE. and SW., by 1/4 mile\r\nwide. It has a sharp, rocky bottom, shoalest in the center, where are 25\r\nfathoms, sloping gradually southwest and falling off suddenly on the\r\nnortheast side to the mud in 60 fathoms on the edges. Cod, haddock, and\r\ncusk are here the year around. Hake occur in summer on the muddy edges.\r\nIt is a fairly good lobster ground on the shoal. The Outer Bouten lies ½\r\nmile SW. of the Inner, separated from it by a deep, muddy channel. It\r\nhas a small shoal of 30 fathoms rising suddenly from the surrounding\r\nmud. Fish and seasons of their presence are as on Inner Bouten. Fishing\r\non these grounds is mainly by hand line and trawl. Marks: The Tripod on\r\nWestern Duck Island on the eastern side of the big eastern mountain of\r\nCamden: Black Head just out by White Head; White Head through the \"Hole\r\nin the Wall.\"\r\n\r\nHill Ground. This ground is SSW 9 miles from Matinic: between 3 and 4\r\nmiles long NE and SW and some 2 miles wide. The shoalest part has 35\r\nfathoms and a rocky bottom. From this it slopes gradually to a depth of\r\n50 fathoms over a bottom of mixed gravel, rocks and mud. Its best\r\nfishing is for hake, using both hand lines and trawls.\r\n\r\nSeguin Sou'Sou'West Ground. This ground lies SSW. from the western part\r\nof Seguin Island, the center distant 4 miles. It is a rocky shoal, ½\r\nmile long by 200 yards wide, with a ½-acre shoal in the center. Depths\r\nare 7 to 14 fathoms. This is evidently a SSW continuation of the Hill\r\nGround. It is fished by small boats for rock cod by hand-lining.\r\nTrawling is done in March for cod, and this is also a cod ground in\r\nApril. It is both a small-boat and a vessel ground and is a lobster\r\nground the year around. Marks: Elwells Rock touching the western side\r\nof Seguin, and Fullers Rock touching the southern part of Bald Head.\r\n\r\nSeguin Ridge. This ridge is SSW. from Seguin Island, distant 5 miles.\r\nFour miles long. ESE. and WSW by ½ mile wide. There are a number of\r\nsmall rocky spots--hummocks of 9 to 14 fathoms in depth. In general the\r\nground has from 10 to 40 fathoms over it, except as mentioned. Cod and\r\ncusk are taken in the spring, haddock in May and June. and hake in\r\nsummer. It is a good cod ground in the fall and also a lobster ground. A\r\nfew pollock are seined here in the spring. Fishing is by hand lines,\r\ngill netting, and trawling. Marks: Pond Island Light on the eastern spur\r\nof Seguin; Wooded Mark Island on Bald Head (Small Point).\r\n\r\nSeguin Ground. This ground is SW. by S. from Seguin Island, distant\r\nabout 7 miles to the center. About 4 miles long. NE. and SW., and a\r\nlittle more than 2 miles wide in the widest part. There is a small\r\nhummock called Bumpers Island Ground on the northern end with depths of\r\n13 fathoms. The northern part is mostly rocky, but toward the south the\r\nbottom is gravelly and sloping, so that on the middle and southern\r\nportions there are depths of 35 to 45 fathoms. Cod, hake, and pollock\r\nare the principal fishes taken here and furnish some of the best fishing\r\nin this vicinity. Haddock are not common here but are abundant on the\r\nsandy bottom to the westward in April and May. Trawl fishing and gill\r\nnetting are done in the spring for cod and hand lining for cod and\r\npollock in October. It is a small-boat and vessel ground and a winter\r\nlobster ground.\r\n\r\nMcIntire Reef. This reef is SSW. from Bald Head (Cape Small Point). The\r\ndistance to the center is 4½ miles. This is 2 miles long. NE. and SW.,\r\nby ½ mile wide. Marks are Yarmouth Island Hill over Mark Island and Pond\r\nIsland Light on the northern part of Fullers Rock. This reef is very\r\nbroken and hummocky and has a rocky bottom and depths from 14 to 20\r\nfathoms. A shoal of 7 fathoms is on the northwest part, where there is\r\ngood hand-lining for cod. It is a good lobster ground. Just east of this\r\nground is a piece of bottom composed of hard mud and shells where hake\r\nusually are abundant in summer.\r\n\r\nSeguin Hub. This lies SSE. 5½ miles from Seguin Light. There is a\r\ncollection of half a dozen small hummocks rising from the 65 or 70\r\nfathoms of the surrounding muddy bottom to 30 or 35 fathoms of rocky\r\nbottom. These are hand-line spots. Species and seasons are as on Seguin\r\nGround, except that a great proportion of hake are taken here on mud\r\nfrom 60 fathoms down. It is a cod ground in spring and summer. Marks:\r\nHunnewell Point Woods on Seguin; Damariscotta Hill over Damariscove\r\nIsland.\r\n\r\nCow Ground. Nearly SW. from Bald Head, the center distant 6½ miles.\r\nThis is nearly 4 miles long in a NE. and SW. direction and 1½ miles\r\nwide. The northeast portion is rough and rocky and has depths from 16 to\r\n18 fathoms. On the southwest part gravel and stones predominate, and the\r\nbottom slopes off to 20 or 30 fathom depths. Trawling and hand-lining\r\nare the principal methods employed here, but there is an increasing\r\namount of gill netting. Cod and pollock are the principal fishes taken\r\nhere, mainly in the spring. This is a lobster ground from November to\r\nApril.\r\n\r\nMurre Hub. This lies WSW. from Small Point, the center distant 10 3/4\r\nmiles and 3 miles SW. from Seguin. This ground is 3 miles long. N. and\r\nS., with an average width of 1½ miles. Depths are from 34 to 45\r\nfathoms. The inner parts are shoalest, and the bottom there is sharp\r\nrocks and broken ground. From this the ground slopes gradually to the\r\nsouth, where the bottom is sand and gravel. Cod are here from spring to\r\nOctober; hake from June to October; and haddock are present during the\r\nwinter season. Fishing is almost entirely by trawling.\r\n\r\nMistaken Ground. This ground bears N. from the center of New Ledge.\r\nfrom which it is distant about 10 miles; from Portland Lightship SE.\r\n½ S 21 miles to the edge and 22 miles to the shoal water. It is 8 miles\r\nlong in an E. and W. direction and 5 miles wide. Depths are from 45 to\r\n100 fathoms, both the shoalest and the deepest soundings being on the\r\nwestern part, where the bottom is mostly rocks and boulders. There is\r\nsaid to be a small shoal \"peak\" of 35 fathoms here. Over the greater\r\npart of the ground the bottom is of rocks and gravel. In proportion to\r\nits size this ground is nearly as important as New Ledge, being resorted\r\nto by the same species of fish at the same seasons and being visited by\r\nthe same type of craft, with a larger number of the small crafts\r\noperating here and the larger vessels fishing here principally during\r\nthe worst of the winter weather.\r\n\r\nThe fishing is by hand line, trawl, and gill netting, with a lessening\r\nuse of the hand line and an increase in the use of this ground by the\r\ngill-net fleet. Cod and cusk are taken here from May to July and\r\nthrough October and November, the cod predominating on the ridgy bottom\r\nin the deep water, on the western and northwestern side. Hake are also\r\nfound here in the winter. Haddock are fairly abundant from December to\r\nMarch. There are usually many pollock on the shoal in fall and winter.\r\n\r\nTag Ground. Between Broken Ground and Seguin Island, ESE. from Seguin,\r\ndistant 5 miles. A narrow rocky ridge 2 miles long, in a NNE. and SSW.\r\ndirection, with an uneven bottom and depths from 14 to 30 fathoms.\r\nPrincipally a summer small-boat ground fished by hand lines, trawls, and\r\ngill nets. Cod are found here the year around. Haddock are abundant in\r\nthe winter, hake in the summer months, and the pollock are here also in\r\nthe summer season when \"top schooling.\" Cusk are found in the deep water\r\nall the year.\r\n\r\nOuter Kettle, also known as Kettle Bottom. The center of this ground\r\nbears S. from Seguin Island, from which the northern edge of the ground\r\nis distant 10 miles. Its length is 12 miles in a N. and S. direction,\r\nand its width 10 miles, thus being roughly circular in forum. It is an\r\nuneven piece of bottom consisting of rocks, gravel, and mud. The depths\r\nrange from 25 to 75 fathoms. This is one of the best fishing grounds on\r\nthis part of the coast. Cod are the most abundant fish and are taken the\r\nyear around. Haddock are plentiful in the winter months and cusk are\r\npresent all the year in the 50-fathom depths. Fishing here is by trawl,\r\nhand line, and gill nets operated by small boats, sloops, and, in the\r\nrougher weather of the winter, larger vessels, which visit it also,\r\ngenerally to make one \"set\" at a season when a \"fish day\" (one on which\r\nit is possible to fish) is the exception.\r\n\r\nMurray Hole. A small circular piece of ground about 1½ miles across\r\nand capable of taking about 40 or 50 lines of trawl: it lies between the\r\ntwo kettles and heads S. by E. from Seguin. Depths here are from 42 to\r\n60 fathoms over a bottom of pebbles and gravel. It is a good cod and\r\nhake ground in June and July.\r\n\r\nInner Kettle. This is S. by E. from Seguin and distant 8 miles. The\r\ndepths here average 40 fathoms over a bottom of gravel and rocks.\r\nSpecies and season of abundance are as on the Outer Kettle. Marks are as\r\nfollows: The Eastern Hawkwings (west side of the Kennebec River) on\r\nwestern side of Seguin; Damariscove Mountain just touching the east side\r\nof Damariscove Island.\r\n\r\nBantam. This ground lies off Seguin 6 miles E. by N. It has a bottom of\r\nrocky broken ground. There is a buoy in the center over a reef that is\r\nsaid to break at low water. Elsewhere depths range from 14 to 20\r\nfathoms. The shoal is about 2 miles long in a NE. and SW. direction and\r\nis about 1 mile wide. This is a cod and haddock ground in the spring,\r\nand bake are plentiful in summer on the edges of the ground.\r\n\r\nWhite Head Ground. Depths on the shoal (the White Hub: Bring Budd\r\ncottage out by White Head, Black Head. and Allens Island touching) are 7\r\nfathoms, thence to 20 fathoms on the edges about it. This ground extends\r\nNE. and SW., 2 miles long by 1/4 mile wide. The bottom is chiefly\r\nbroken, of rocks, and with spots of coarse gravel and sand. Fish and\r\ntheir seasons are as on Franklin Ground. Marks: Bring Black Head, White\r\nHead, and Gull Head in range on the east side of Monhegan Island.\r\n\r\nGreen Ground. This is a hand-line spot for cod all the year, but the\r\nfishing is best in the spring and continues good until the last of the\r\nfishing for cod about the river mouths in June. There are two shoals,\r\none of 14 and the other of 16 feet, both of which break in rough\r\nweather, but depths elsewhere on the ground about are from 13 to 20\r\nfathoms. The bottom, both on the shoals and about them, is rocky and has\r\nmany starfish upon it, except on the north-western part, where the\r\nbottom is of sand. Marks: The eastern end of Elmwood Rock on the little\r\nhigh woods of Small Point: the Outer Sister on Lower Five Island.\r\n\r\nLambo. This lies B. by N. from Halfway Rock 5 miles. It has a buoy\r\nupon it, marking a 5 fathom shoal that breaks in heavy weather. Good\r\nfishing is to be had in all directions about it, with haddock in June on\r\nthe sand outside it, hake inside in August, and cod on the hard bottom\r\nabout it; but for these it is mostly a summer hand-line spot.\r\n\r\nBull Ground. This is an irregularly shaped piece of bottom of\r\nindefinite area, being perhaps 3 miles long by 2 miles wide. It lies\r\nbetween Lambo Ledge and the White Bull and at about 2 miles distance\r\nfrom Ragged Island. The bottom here is of rocks and mud with depths from\r\n20 to 30 fathoms. This ground furnishes hake fishing in June, July, and\r\nAugust. Cod are taken here in good numbers in the fall by gill nets,\r\nwith a lesser amount also in the spring by the same method. In the\r\nwinter the cod are taken here by \"bobber trawl.\" Haddock are taken about\r\nthe edges in August. mainly by hand line. This ground is visited\r\nprincipally by small boats, the greater part of the catch being taken by\r\ngill nets, although trawls and hand lines also are used here.\r\n\r\nThe Garden. This is a broken piece of ground lying outside The Elbow\r\nand Eagle Island. It runs NNE. and SSW., is about 2 miles long by 1 mile\r\nwide, and has depths running from 35 to 60 fathoms. This is a fall\r\nground for hand-line fishing for cod, while haddock, cod, and cusk are\r\nfound here in the spring. Hake are taken in May and June on the mud\r\nabout the edges.\r\n\r\nMarks: Halfway Rock Light on the big field of Chebeague Island; Eagle\r\nIsland Woods on the woods in the Eastern Bay.\r\n\r\nSand Shoal.

Fishing is by trawl, hand line, and gill\r\nnet. Marks: Western Light of Cape Elizabeth on eastern part of woods on\r\nCape until the lightship bears NE.\r\n\r\nEagle Island Ground. This lies S. from Halfway Rock 2 miles. It has a\r\nrocky bottom with 20 to 25 fathoms. It is a good cod ground the year\r\naround, fished mainly by hand line; there is little trawling here and\r\nonly a small amount of gill netting.\r\n\r\nFlat Ledge; Temple Ledge. Two miles SW. of Bald Head, Cape Small\r\nPoint, rises a piece of rocky ground from the 20-fathom depths\r\nsurrounding it. Over the shoal in the center are 5 fathoms, and from\r\nthis the water deepens on all sides, there being 16 fathoms on the\r\ndeepest part of the ledge and an average of 20 fathoms about it. The\r\nrocky bottom is about 1½ miles long, NE. and SW., by about 3/4 mile\r\nwide. The ledge and the hard bottom about it make good gill-netting\r\ngrounds for cod in the spring months. On the ledge a considerable amount\r\nof hand-lining fur cod and pollock is carried on in late May and through\r\nJune. In the normal seasons of the mackerel fishery this is a good\r\nground on which to seine these fish in June. July, and August. It is\r\nalso a good lobster ground and is a haddock ground in July and August.\r\nMarks: Wallace House in Bald Head Cove on the western edge of Bald\r\nHead; Flag Island and the eastern Brown Cow Into line.\r\n\r\nThe Gully: Mark Island Gully.

It is a good lobster\r\ngrounds.\r\n\r\nHaddock are taken here in the spring months by trawling; cod are taken\r\non trawl and in gill nets during February and March and from Augusta to\r\nNovember. Hake are taken during June, July and August by the sane\r\nmethods as are used in catching the other species.\r\n\r\nNew Meadows Channel. West from The Gully; E. from Seguin. This is a\r\nspring gill-net ground. Mostly a cod ground.\r\n\r\nPollock Hub.  This ground lies SE. from the lightship 6 to 8 miles and\r\n13½ miles S. from Cushings Island bell buoy. It is a rocky piece of\r\nbottom, having about 29 fathoms over it. It is about ½ mile across and\r\nis fished by hand line, trawl, and gill net, but is mostly a summer\r\nhand-line spot. It is a good cod ground in the spring and good for\r\npollock in their season. Between this and Trinidad (SE. by S. from\r\nPollock Hub 3 miles) is a fishing ground for haddock in January and\r\nFebruary, on a broken bottom, in depths of from 40 to 60 fathoms.

It has a broken bottom of rocks \"blisters,\"\r\nand mud, and is 3½ miles long by 2½ miles wide, with depths from 50 to\r\n80 fathoms. It is a cusk ground the year around as well as a year-around\r\ncod ground, also, but this fishing is at its best in the spring. It is a\r\nhake ground on the deeper soundings from September to December. Fishing\r\nhere is carried on by trawling, hand-lining, and gill netting.\r\n\r\nBig Ridge, or Doggetts. These names are given to a piece of fishing\r\nground about 8 miles long by 2 miles wide lying 18 miles SE. by S. ½ S.\r\nfrom the lightship at Portland or 14 miles SE. by E. from the same\r\npoint, according to which part it is desired to fish upon. It has from\r\n45 on the shoal in the center to 80 fathoms of water on the deeper parts\r\nover a bottom of rocks and gravel on the shallower portions and of mud\r\nabout the edges and in the deeper soundings.\r\n\r\nCod are abundant here in spring and fall on the shoaler parts of the\r\nbank and are present the year around on the muddy edges and in the deep\r\nwater about it; the spring school, however, is the largest. Hake are\r\nfound in spring and summer on the edges in deep water. A few haddock may\r\nbe taken in the winter and spring, January to April, inclusive. Cusk can\r\nbe taken the year around, the best fishing being in spring and winter.\r\nThe February cusk school is the largest, and the best catches are made\r\nin the deep water about the edges of the ground. Fishing here is\r\nprincipally by trawling, but hand-lining and gill netting also are\r\nemployed, the latter method in continually increasing volume.\r\n\r\nLying off Cape Porpoise, between the bearings of SE. and SSE., and at\r\ndistances varying from 6 to 8 miles, are a number of small, rocky, or\r\npebbly bottoms having depths ranging from 18 to 25 fathoms.

Depths are from 8 to 20\r\nfathoms over a broken piece of bottom, except for a mud gully about 3\r\nmiles from the main running NE. and SW. about 3 miles long. In general,\r\nthis is a small-boat ground, where good catches of cod and haddock are\r\nmade in spring and fall, especially in the latter season, with good\r\nhand-lining for cod in July and August in 8 and 10 fathom depths. These\r\ngrounds are fished by trawl, hand line and gill nets. All the grounds\r\nbetween Cape Porpoise and Boon Island are good lobster grounds.\r\n\r\nWells Bay. Beside a number of small, rocky patches of fishing ground of\r\nless importance, resorted to chiefly by small-boat fishermen and by gill\r\nnetters from Portsmouth, Wood Island, and Cape Porpoise; this ground has\r\na good cod shoal for spring and winter fishing, which also furnishes\r\ngood haddocking from April to October. The depths on this are from 25 to\r\n30 fathoms. These are fished by trawl, hand lines, and gill nets\r\n(perhaps mainly by the latter) operated by the smaller fishing vessels,\r\nchiefly from Portsmouth, Wood island, Cape Porpoise, and Portland.\r\n\r\nLightons. This ground is SE. by E. 8 miles from Cape Porpoise, 3 miles\r\nlong by 2 miles wide, with depths of 25 to 30 fathoms over a generally\r\ngravelly bottom. This is somewhat more productive as a haddock ground\r\nfrom January 1 to March, but cod and hake are numerous in the same season\r\nalso. A small amount of cod may be taken here in the summer. This is a\r\ngood lobster ground.\r\n\r\nTracadie; The Acre. This bears NE. by E. from Boon island, distant 5\r\nmiles. It is 1 mile in diameter and has a depth of 50 fathoms over a\r\nbottom of rocks and gravel.

Extends from the shore soundings at White Island (one\r\nof the isles of Shoals) 7 or 8 miles SE. nearly to Jeffreys in a long,\r\nrather narrow point. It is a piece of broken ground with a hard bottom,\r\nhaving depths running from 20 fathoms on the inner parts to 50 fathoms\r\nfarther out and deepening suddenly on all sides to the mud about it.\r\nFish and their seasons are as on Blue Clay, haddock being most abundant\r\non the eastern edge from January through March. This is growing steadily\r\nin importance as a gill-netting ground.\r\n\r\nThe Prairie. This name has been given to a flat ground of generally\r\nlevel bottom, lying E. by N. from Boon Island 7 miles. It has depths of\r\nfrom 41 to 50 fathoms over mud and gravel, rising out of 60 fathoms\r\nover the muddy ground about it. It extends in a generally ENE. by WSW.\r\ndirection, 2 miles long by 1 mile wide. It is a \"blistery\" ground, the\r\npresence of these growths on a rocky or gravelly bottom usually meaning\r\ngood fishing. This is principally a haddock ground, with the best season\r\nfrom mid March to the 1st of May. This is a small-boat and gill-netting\r\nground. It is also visited to a considerable extent by the larger\r\nvessels of the Portland fleet in the severer weather of the winter and\r\nearly spring because of its accessibility.\r\n\r\nBlue Clay Ground. also called Southeast Ground. This bears S. by E.\r\nfrom Boon Island. from which it is distant 8 miles. The form of the\r\nground is roughly square and is from 4 to S miles across. Depths here\r\nrange from 30 on the shoalest parts to 60 fathoms, the bottom being of\r\ntough blue clay. The water deepens suddenly on the muddy ground all\r\nabout it. It is one of the best winter haddock grounds in this vicinity,\r\nparticularly the eastern edge, which is much resorted to by haddock\r\ntrawlers from January through March, when this species is most abundant\r\nhere. It is a good winter cod ground, also.\r\n\r\nA long, narrow strip of hard bottom, separated from the Blue Clay by a\r\nnarrow mud gully of somewhat greater depth, is called the Prong. Depths\r\nhere run from 30 fathoms on the inner parts to 70 fathoms offshore. This\r\npiece furnishes a very suitable bottom for operating gill nets and is\r\nmuch visited by this type of craft. The Prong lies S. by E. from Cape\r\nPorpoise 17 miles. Marks: Bring Acre Hill in line, Notch of Agamenticus\r\nat the distance from Cape Porpoise just given. From the Isle of Shoals\r\nthe Prong is distant 10 miles SE. by E.\r\n\r\nDuck Island Ridges. These are two narrow rocky ridges running from\r\nDuck Island (one of the Isles of Shoals) toward Boon Island. reaching\r\nwithin I mile of the latter. Depths are from 25 to 30 fathoms. These are\r\ngood cusk and haddock grounds in the winter and spring, the cusk\r\nremaining on the ground also from April to October. This is a cod ground\r\nin winter and spring, the fish being taken on the \"bobber trawl.\" which\r\nis a trawl of the ordinary type buoyed to \"set\" 1 fathom or so from the\r\nbottom. It is a hand-line ground in summer for cod and pollock. Both\r\nsmall boats and vessels, line trawlers, and gillnetters operate here. It\r\nis also a lobster ground.\r\n\r\nBoon Island Rock Ground. This ground begins ½ mile eastward of Boon\r\nIsland Ledge and runs in an ESE. direction 2 or 3 miles from the ledge.\r\nIt has a bottom of sharp rocks and clay and depths from 40 to 60\r\nfathoms. It is an excellent fishing ground for cod, haddock, and cusk\r\nand is one of the best winter fishing grounds for haddock in this\r\nvicinity. It is fished mainly by line trawlers but is not much used as\r\nyet by gill-netters, being a somewhat difficult piece of bottom for\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nTower Ground.  This is a winter haddock ground having depths averaging\r\n50 fathoms over a ridgy and broken bottom. This is about 3 miles long by\r\n2 miles wide and bears about SE. from Boon Island. Marks: Bring Boon\r\nIsland Light on the Peak of Mount Agamenticus, running off until the top\r\nof the tower and the top of the mountain are level, perhaps 6 miles from\r\nBoon Island.\r\n\r\nTen Acre or Nipper Ground. Extends S. ½ E. from Boon Island 6 miles\r\nand E. from Isles of Shoals 7 miles. This shoal is about 1/4 mile wide\r\nand has 18 to 20 fathoms over clay and mud, the ground sloping gradually\r\nto 50 or 60 fathoms near the edge. This is a good fishing ground for\r\ncod, haddock, cusk, and pollock in the spring, while on the muddy edges\r\nhake are abundant in September. Marks: White Hills over Boon Island on\r\ncenter (these cross bearings meet near the center of the ground); also,\r\nthe Black Hill W. of Portsmouth over the Star Island of the Isles of\r\nShoals leads to the small rocky shoal that is in the middle of the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nIpswich Bay. This extends from the north side of Cape Ann about to\r\nPortsmouth and is resorted to in winter by large schools of cod coming\r\nhere to spawn. Shore soundings deepen here gradually from the land,\r\nreaching 35 to 40 fathoms at 6 or 7 miles out. Within this limit the\r\nbottom is mainly sandy, though rocky patches are numerous between\r\nNewburyport and Cape Ann. Beyond 40 fathoms the bottom is mainly mud.\r\n\r\nThe principal cod-fishing grounds of Ipswich Bay lie off the northern\r\nshore, from Newburyport to the entrance of Portsmouth Harbor, 1½ to 5\r\nmiles off the land In 12 to 25 fathoms. Cod are taken abundantly off\r\nBoars Head, also. During 1923 and 1924 the cod fishing in these waters,\r\nespecially off Boars Head, was the best for some years. Fishing is done\r\nby trawls and hand-lining, and of late years a large and increasing\r\ngill-netting fleet has operated in these waters, especially from March\r\nto June.\r\n\r\nThe muddy ground outside these waters Is a hake ground much frequented\r\nby small boats and vessels from the Isles of Shoals and Cape Ann during\r\nthe summer and fall. \"Flounder dragging\" Is a considerable industry in\r\nthese waters, the craft employed being a small type of the otter\r\ntrawler, mainly operating out of Newburyport on a piece of shallow mud\r\nbottom extending from NE. by E. to SE. of the Isles of Shoals and on\r\nanother ESE. from Thacher Island. Depths are from 4 to 14 fathoms.\r\n\r\nMassachusetts Bay. The larger part of this ground, especially inside\r\nStellwagens Bank, has a mud bottom, on which large quantities of fish\r\nare rarely taken. On the shore soundings between Boston Harbor and\r\nPlymouth to Sandwich are many rocky ledges, which are favorite feeding\r\ngrounds for cod In winter and fall. Off Plymouth, in late March, there\r\nis generally a large school of codfish, from which the gill-netters take\r\ngood fares. All over this ground in depths of from 10 to 40 fathoms.\r\nnetters from Gloucester and Boston operate in a codfishery In the months\r\nof December, January, and February. There is a considerable hand-line\r\nfishery for pollock in the fall. The gill-netters also take large fares\r\nof this species on these shore grounds as well as about Gloucester,\r\ntheir fares for a single month often amounting to nearly 4,000,000\r\npounds. November and December usually show the largest catches. These\r\nvessels operate mostly between Boston and Gloucester, and their catch\r\ngoes principally to \"the splitters.\" since the abundance of the fish\r\nnaturally operates to reduce its price. This pollock netting comes to an\r\nabrupt end with the closing days of January, when the fish move\r\noffshore.\r\n\r\nHerring appear about Cape Ann in September in large numbers in most\r\nyears, the fishing lasting about two weeks, when the school moves slowly\r\ninward toward the head, and the last catches usually are taken off Minot\r\nLight, Boston. The mackerel, after leaving the coast of Maine in their\r\nautumnal migrations, pass by Cape Ann and enter Massachusetts Bay during\r\nOctober and November, where they are taken in great number by purse\r\nseiners, netters, and pound nets, of which latter there are many in Cape\r\nCod Bay, and which take many mackerel and herring in their seasons.\r\n\r\nNear the center of Cape Cod Bay, on a line between Race Point and Cape\r\nCod Canal, lies a rocky elevation on which cod are taken, known as Eagle\r\nLedge or Bay Ledge, and by Provincetown fishermen as Red Bank. It has a\r\ndepth of 13 fathoms. Cape Cod Bay has a considerable Industry in\r\nflounder dragging, the fish being taken by a small type of otter trawl.\r\nSouth and southeast of Thacher Island from 5 to 8 miles lies a stretch\r\nof muddy bottom with patches of sand scattered over it, where a\r\nconsiderable amount of this method of fishing is carried on during most\r\nof the year.\r\n\r\nOld Man's Pasture. This ground is due S. from Thacher Island, SE. from\r\nEastern Point Light. Cape Ann, and distant 5 miles. It is about 3/4 mile\r\nlong, NNE. and SSW. by 1/ mile wide. The bottom is rough and rocky, with\r\nabout 24 fathoms average depths. It is a cod ground for the entire year,\r\nwhich fish are taken by gill-netters principally in November. Pollock\r\nare taken here, also by gill-netters, from October 1 to December.\r\nApparently there are few haddock here in the fall, but there is good\r\nfishing for these from February to April 1. It is also a lobster ground.\r\n\r\nHarts Ground. This lies S. 1/4 E. from Eastern Point Light. distant\r\n5½ miles. It is 3/4 mile long in an ENE. and WSW. direction by 1/4\r\nmile wide, and is a small, rocky patch with a depth of 30 fathoms. It is\r\na summer haddock ground, visited mainly by small boats. There is little\r\nor no gill netting here.\r\n\r\nEagle Ridge, sometimes called Little Middle Bank. This ridge is 7 2/3\r\nmiles S. by W. from Eastern Point Light, Cape Ann. and 1 mile long, NE.\r\nand SW., by ½ mile wide. The average depths are 25 fathoms on a rocky\r\nand uneven bottom. Formerly, with Old Man's Pasture and Browns Ledge.\r\nthis was considered the principal winter grounds of the cod, but not so\r\nmany have been taken here at that season in recent years.\r\n\r\nInside this area, at an average distance of 2½ miles from Eastern Point\r\nLight and between bearings S. ½ E. and SW.. are a number of small, rocky\r\npatches having depths of from 10 to 25 fathoms--Browns Ledge, Spot of\r\nRocks, Saturday Night Ledge, and Burnhams Rocks; SW ½ W. from Saturday\r\nNight Ledge, 6 miles, lies Old Tillie. Farther in are two shoal spots\r\nbearing nearly west from Eastern Point. one at 3/4 mile and the other at\r\n2 miles distance, each having 11 fathoms. The first is called Eleven\r\nFathom Ground. the second, Kettle Island Ledge. This latter lies ½ mile\r\nSE. of Kettle Island. These are cod grounds in winter and haddock\r\ngrounds in summer. Gill-netters operate from Kettle Island to Halfway\r\nRock and Italian boats trawl at all seasons off The Graves.\r\n\r\nWestern Point Ridge. This bears S. by E. ½ E. from Eastern Point\r\nLight, distant 9 1/4 miles. Its length NE. and SW. is 1½ miles and its\r\nwidth is ¾ mile. The depths average 29 fathoms over a broken and rocky\r\nbottom. Small vessels and boats fish here for cod and haddock in the\r\nsummer. Netters take many pollock on all these shore grounds in the fall\r\nruns, October to January furnishing the largest fares. Apparently these\r\nare spawning fish that leave abruptly during January, working offshore\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nThe Dump. This lies inside the lightship at Boston, extending from\r\nthis to and well into Nahant Bay. On these inner grounds soundings are\r\nfrom 12 to 15 fathoms over sand and gravel. This portion is a cod ground\r\nfrom March to May. The outer parts of the ground have from 15 to 20\r\nfathoms of water over a gravelly and muddy bottom, which usually\r\nfurnishes haddocking during the early spring. These are mainly gill-net\r\ngrounds.\r\n\r\nInner Bank. This lies SE. from Thacher Island 12 miles to the northern\r\nend, whence it extends in a generally southerly direction for about 10\r\nmiles, having an average width of 2½ miles. Depths here average about\r\n40 fathoms on a hard, gravelly bottom, where haddock usually are taken\r\nin the spring, pollock in the fall, and cod in the winter months. This\r\npiece of ground is much fished by the gill-netting fleet out of\r\nGloucester.\r\n\r\nA large area of muddy ground lying E. of this and between it and Middle\r\nBank is much visited by the flounder draggers out of Boston and\r\nGloucester. Depths here are from 40 to 55 fathoms over a comparatively\r\nsmooth bottom.\r\n\r\nA ridge that lies just S. of the Limiter Bank, and which may be a\r\ncontinuation of it, extends from a point E. by N. from Scituate buoy to\r\na point SE. by S. from the same about 10 or 11 miles and furnishes cod\r\nfishing in February, beginning at Brewers Spot, on the southern end of\r\nthe ground, and working northward with the schools to Si's Spot, at the\r\nnorthern end of the ridge. The bottom over much of the ridge is of\r\nmussel beds, with from 25 to 30 fathoms of water, but at the northern\r\nend it is rocky and pebbly, with from 30 to 35 fathoms and on the\r\nsouthern end the bottom is composed of stones, gravel, and pebbles with\r\n20 to 25 fathoms of water over it. This ridge is flanked E. and W. by a\r\nmuddy bottom, which furnishes the flounder-dragging fleet with good\r\nfishing during most of the year.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Table 2--Inner Fishing Grounds, showing the principal species taken\r\nupon them.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: Again, Captain Smith (1614): \"At the Ile of Manahigan, in\r\n43 1/2 of Northerly latitude . . . The remarkablest isle, and mountains\r\nfor landmarks, a round high isle, with little Monas by its side, betwixt\r\nwhich is a small harbor, where our ships can lie at anchor.\"\r\n(Transcriber's note: \"Ile\" is as spelled in the footnote, despite the\r\nother spellings of it in the footnote as \"isle.\")]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOUTER GROUNDS\r\n\r\nGrand Manan Bank. This bank is at the entrance of the Bay of Fundy, SW.\r\n½ S. from the southwest head of Grand Manan Island from which the\r\nnorthern part of the bank is 15 miles distant. From Mount Desert Rock,\r\nE. by S., it is 45 miles distant. The bank is 10 miles long and 5 miles\r\nwide, extending in a NE. and SW. direction. The bottom is mostly stones\r\nand gravel, the depths running from 24 to 45 fathoms. Soundings of 18\r\nand 21 fathoms are found on the northeast part.\r\n\r\nCod (especially abundant when the June school is on the ground) and\r\npollock are the principal fish. Haddock are not usually abundant,\r\nalthough sometimes they are plentiful in the fall from late September to\r\nDecember; hake are fairly abundant on the mud between Grand Manan Bank\r\nand the Middle Ground (In The Gully). This is a good halibut bank, the\r\nfish being in 33 to 60 fathoms in June and July; the southwest soundings\r\nand the southeast soundings are most productive always. The best fishing\r\nseason is from April to October, when the fish come to this hank to\r\nfeed. In the spring the fish, other than halibut, are mostly on the\r\nsouthwest part, but later (July to October) the best fishing is had on\r\nthe northern edge of the ground. The very best herring fishing for large\r\nherring (food fish) occurs on this bank in June and July. In general,\r\nthis is a small-vessel ground fished by craft from Cutler, Eastport,\r\nGrand Manan, and, to a less extent, Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, with an\r\noccasional visit by craft from Portland and Rockland, chiefly trawlers\r\nof moderate size.\r\n\r\nTides run NE. in flood and SW. on the ebb and are quite strong, the\r\nflood being the heaviest. Because of these powerful currents, fishing is\r\nsomewhat difficult, it being necessary to make sets at the slack of the\r\ntides, getting the gear over and traveling with the finish of the\r\ncurrent, to take it up and come back with the tide's return.\r\n\r\nMiddle Ground. This ground is between Grand Manan Bank and Marblehead\r\nBank; its length from NW. to SE. is 1½ miles, and it is about ½ mile\r\nwide. Depths averaging 37 fathoms are found on the southern edge on a\r\nhard, rocky bottom, increasing to over 60 fathoms over much of the\r\nground. The remainder of the bank has a bottom of sand and gravel. There\r\nis a shoal of 28 fathoms near the center with a bottom of rocks and\r\nstones. The species and seasons of their abundance are much as on Grand\r\nManan Bank and German Bank, but the Middle Ground is rather better as a\r\ncod ground than as a ground for other species, June, perhaps, being the\r\nbest month for the fishing.\r\n\r\nMarblehead Bank. Situated between Grand Manan and German Banks, the\r\nshoal water bearing SSE. from Moosabec Light, distant 32 miles. It is\r\nfrom 12 to 15 miles long and 7 or 8 miles wide, lying between 44° 00'\r\nand 44° 10' north latitude and 66° 58' and 67° 13' west longitude. There\r\nare from 35 to 70 fathoms of water over it; the bottom is mostly clay\r\nand gravel. The principal fishing is for cod, pollock, and haddock, but\r\nthere are more or less hake and cusk to be had from this ground.\r\n\r\nThe best fishing season is from early spring through the early part of\r\nthe summer, and this ground is of little account after July. The same\r\ntype of vessels operate here as on the neighboring banks, with an\r\noccasional larger vessel. The craft are mostly hand-liners from Cutler,\r\nJonesport, and Rockland, with a few vessels from the trawl fleets of\r\nPortland and others from the Canadian Provinces. Haddock are found in\r\nthe shoal water from May to October. Cusk are on the eastern portion in\r\nfrom 60 to 70 fathoms virtually the year around. Many large hake are\r\npresent on the western edge in 80 to 90 fathoms in the summer. The June\r\nand July cod school is the best, but this species is present in smaller\r\nnumbers all the year. Halibut are found all over the bank, being\r\nespecially abundant in the eastern shoal water in spring and summer\r\n(April to October). It seems necessary to leave the halibut trawls down\r\nfor a longer set here than on other grounds in order to make a good\r\ncatch.\r\n\r\nGerman Bank. This is one of the most important banks in the Bay of\r\nFundy. (We are here referring to the German Bank in the bay and not to\r\nthe part of Seal Island ground, so marked on some charts.) It bears SE.\r\nfrom Bakers Island Light, Mount Desert, from which the northeast part is\r\nabout 52 miles distant. Its length is about 15 miles, the width 9 or 10\r\nmiles. It lies between 43° 38' and 43° 53' north latitude and 64° 58'\r\nand 67° 15' west longitude. Depths are from 65 to 100 fathoms with\r\nsoundings of 47 fathoms on the northern part. The bottom is mostly tough\r\nred clay with spots of mud, sand, gravel, and pebbles on some parts. The\r\ntides set in and out over this bank to and from the Bay of Fundy, the\r\nebb SW. and the flood NE., but the currents are not so strong as might\r\nbe expected.\r\n\r\nCod, hake, and cusk are the principal species taken, with pollock and\r\nhaddock in lesser amounts. It is a fairly good halibut ground also,\r\nwherever a bottom of black and white gravel is found, though formerly\r\nlittle regarded as such. The fish (except hake) are most abundant in the\r\nspring. This ground is not much fished of late years, but was formerly\r\nconsidered a good place for hake fishermen in summer. Probably it is\r\nequally as good now, but the demand for hake has diminished materially\r\nin recent years, and this fishery has suffered in consequence. Mostly\r\nMaine vessels fish this bank, from Cutler, Moosabec, and Rockland, with\r\na few from Portland and perhaps an occasional visitor from the Yarmouth,\r\nNova Scotia, fleet.\r\n\r\nNewfound. This ground is 45 miles SE. by S. from Mount Desert Rock and\r\nhas depths of 90 to 100 fathoms over a gravelly bottom. It is about 12\r\nto 15 miles long. ENE. and WSW., by 7 miles wide, lying in the track of\r\nthe Yarmouth (Nova Scotia) to Boston steamers. Apparently, this title is\r\ngiven to some rediscovered old ground and with a new generation of\r\nfishermen displaces the old name. This is not a haddock ground, but cod,\r\ncusk, and hake (large fish) are abundant here in the spring. Perhaps\r\nthis is an all-the-year fishing ground, but thus far no further\r\ninformation about it has been obtainable. It is about 12 to 15 miles\r\nlong, ENE aned WSW, by 7 miles wide, lying in the track of the\r\nYarmouth (Nova Scotia) to Boston steamers.\r\n\r\nJones Ground. This is an important cod ground though of small size.\r\nThe western part bears SE, from Bakers Island Light, distant 32 miles.\r\nThe ground is 10 to 12 miles long, NE. and SW. and 5 miles wide. Depths\r\nrange from 50 to 100 fathoms. The bottom, which is quite broken,\r\nconsists of rocks, gravel, and mud. On the northeast parts, where depths\r\nvary from 50 to 70 fathoms, the bottom is rocky and rough. This part\r\nbears SE. by E. ½ E. from Bakers Island Light, distant 35 miles. (Green\r\nMountain, of Mount Desert, bears NW.) It is a hake ground in 110\r\nfathoms. The center of the ground furnishes good trawl fishing from May\r\n1 to September. The principal catch is large cod, but a smaller amount\r\nof hake, cusk, and pollock are taken also.\r\n\r\nBank Comfort. This is a comparatively little known fishing ground\r\nlying SE. by S. from Mount Desert Rock. distant 12 or 13 miles. It is\r\nsaid to be 5 miles long, SW. and NE., by 3 miles wide. Here are depths\r\nof from 75 to 80 fathoms over a hard gravelly bottom, the shoalest water\r\nbeing some 65 fathoms. This is an excellent ground but little fished\r\nbecause its small size makes it somewhat difficult to find. It is a very\r\ngood cod ground in spring and summer, hand-liners catching large cod\r\nhere from May to August. Hake and cusk are present here in summer also.\r\nIt is scarcely fished at any other than the seasons mentioned.\r\n\r\nClay Bank. This bank lies SW. by W. from Mount Desert Rock, the center\r\ndistant 7 miles. It is 4 miles long, WSW. and ENE., by 2 miles wide.\r\nDepths are from 50 to 80 fathoms over a bottom of hard clay. Cod are the\r\nprincipal catch in spring, hake in summer. There is virtually no winter\r\nfishing.\r\n\r\nNewfound. This ground lies off of the northeast edge of Jeffreys Bank\r\nand is often considered a part of it, but there seems to lie deep water\r\nbetween. This is one of three grounds of the name in these waters. The\r\npresent piece of bottom lies 20 miles SE. by S. from Matinicus block and\r\nS. ½ E. from Seal Island (in Penobscot Bay) and has a broken and\r\nirregular bottom with depths from 60 to 100 fathoms over blue mud and\r\nshells and considerable areas of gravelly ground. It is about 7 miles\r\nlong, E. by N. and W. by S., and about 4 miles wide.\r\n\r\nFishing here in the summer months is mostly by hand-lining because of\r\nthe presence of schools of dogfish in these waters at that season. In\r\nthe spring it is a good ground for cod, and in the fall months cod,\r\nhake, and cusk are taken, all by trawling. Perhaps March is the best\r\nmonth for cod fishing here, the cusk being most numerous at the same\r\nseason, when they are especially abundant in depths of 80 fathoms or\r\nmore and are then taken by trawling. In spring and early summer halibut\r\nare often found in depths of 35 to 60 fathoms on the gravelly parts of\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\nA small rocky eminence just off the northern edge of the ground rises\r\nsharply from the 94-fathom depths surrounding it to reach 48 fathoms. On\r\nthis are taken market cod (2½ to 10 pounds weight) during the spring\r\nmonths and very large cod (fish reaching 50, 60, and 70 pounds or more)\r\nduring June, July, and August. Its small area makes this spot somewhat\r\ndifficult to find.\r\n\r\nJeffreys Bank. This ground lies east of Cashes Bank and, despite its\r\nconsiderable size, is of comparatively little importance as a fishing\r\nground. It is about 20 miles long. SW. and NE., and 10 miles wide. The\r\nnorthern and southern limits are 43° 30' and 43° 15' north latitude. The\r\neastern edge is In 68° 25', the western in 68° 45'. west longitude. The\r\nbottom is somewhat broken--mud, sand, gravel, and pebbles, with a great\r\nnumber of small rocky ridges, upon which good fishing is generally to be\r\nhad, although these spots are quite difficult to find and accommodate\r\nbut little trawl gear. There is virtually no fishing upon much of the\r\ninterior parts of the bank between these spots, where the bottom is\r\nmostly of mud. Depths over the bank vary from 35 to 70 fathoms. The\r\nOuter Fall and the Inner Fall. generally called Monhegan Fall, are the\r\nonly parts of Jeffreys Bank thought to be of much importance as fishing\r\ngrounds. Both these formerly furnished excellent fishing but are not now\r\nas much resorted to, although vessels from Portland and Rockland often\r\nfish here and bring in fair catches.\r\n\r\nCod, haddock, and cusk are the most important species in the fares from\r\nthis ground, with a lesser amount of pollock and a few halibut, these\r\nlatter usually being taken on the small ridges above mentioned In the\r\nmain, this bank is a winter ground; good also in the spring and early\r\nsummer before the dogfish strike it. It is fished mostly by the smaller\r\nvessels--trawlers of from 15 to 70 tons.\r\n\r\nThe Inner Fall lies SE. ½ S. from Monhegan Island, 21½ miles, west of\r\nNewfound 6 miles, and S. by W ½ W. from Matinicus Rock 17 miles. The\r\nOuter Fall lies S. ½ E. from Matinicus Rock 21 miles. These both have\r\nhard sharp bottoms, which are good cod and cusk grounds in the spring.\r\nThe gravelly bottom, both on the Inner Fall and on the Outer Fall, often\r\nholds halibut in the spring and early summer (May 1 to July 15) in\r\ndepths of from 35 to 60 fathoms. The fishing ground of the Inner Fall is\r\nsomewhat difficult to find, the best portions lying in a narrow strip\r\nabout 6 miles long by something less than 1 mile wide along the\r\nnorthwestern edge of the bank.\r\n\r\nSoundings ranging from 35 to 55 fathoms over the main body of the bank\r\ndrop suddenly to 85 and even 94 on the edges. The average depth is about\r\n45 fathoms over a rocky bottom, with good cod fishing in summer and cusk\r\non the hard bottom of the deeper water. Haddock usually are abundant on\r\nthis bank in winter. Along the northern edge of Jeffreys Bank, between\r\nthe Inner Fall and the Outer Fall, in an average depth of 40 fathoms,\r\ncod and halibut are taken in spring and summer. The extreme southern\r\npart of the bank is also a fairly good cod ground, while halibut occur\r\nin fair numbers in summer. Depths here are from 38 to 45 fathoms over\r\nrocks and gravel.\r\n\r\nA small circular piece of ground rises about 2 miles W. of the bank,\r\nlying between it and Toothaker Ridge. This is about 2 miles across and\r\nhas depths averaging 50 fathoms over a rocky bottom. This spot is a good\r\nsummer cod ground.\r\n\r\nToothaker Ridge. This bank is 26 miles S. ½ E. from Monhegan and lies\r\nin an ENE. and WSW. direction. There seem to be two ridges here, the\r\nlarger being about 5 or 6 miles long by about 1½ miles wide. This inner\r\nridge has a shoal of 35 fathoms on the western end, from which it\r\ndeepens eastward to about 45 fathoms, which is the general depth\r\nelsewhere on this piece of ground.\r\n\r\nThe outer ridge parallels the inner at about 1½ miles distance and there\r\nis a deep, narrow gully between. It apparently has about half the area\r\nof the other. This smaller ridge has a 45-fathom shoal of rocks on the\r\nwestern end, deepening the water, like the other, to the eastward to 75\r\nand 80 fathoms over a broken rocky bottom and 90 fathoms on hard mud.\r\nThis is an all-the-year cusk ground. A few cod are present all the year.\r\nbut this species is most abundant here and on the other ridge in the\r\nspring and through June. Hake occur on the muddy ground in summer and\r\nfall.\r\n\r\nOn both shoals are abundant growths of \"lemons\" and like species of fish\r\nfood, and they are good \"hand-line spots\" over their rocky bottoms.\r\nFishing on both is said to be at its best in the spring and in June, the\r\nspecies taken being cod, cusk, pollock, and hake. As before stated,\r\nthese are year-around cod and cusk ground, pollock and hake being\r\npresent in summer and fall, the latter species over the muddy ground.\r\nThese grounds have been thought to lie too rough for trawling. But\r\noccasional good fares are taken on them by this method.\r\n\r\nCashes Bank. Our older reports state that Cashes Bank was not then an\r\nimportant fishing ground except for a short time in the spring, although\r\ngood fares were often taken there in the fall also. The writer has found\r\nit furnishing at least its quota in recent years and in apparently\r\nincreasing volume. It bears E. 1/4 S. from Cape Ann (Thacher Island\r\nLight, from which point most skippers lay their course), from which its\r\nshoaler parts are distant 78 miles, and bears SE. 1/4 S. from Portland\r\nLightship 69 miles to the buoy upon it, where is a depth of 17 fathoms;\r\nand 74 miles SE. ½ S. from Cape Elizabeth eastern light to the buoy. The\r\nbank is about 22 miles long, from 42° 49' to 43° 11' north latitude, and\r\nabout 17 miles wide, from 68° 40' to 69° 03' west longitude. There are\r\nthree small shoals upon its western part, of which the southern has a\r\ndepth of 7 fathoms, the middle one has 4 fathoms, and the northern one\r\nhas 11 fathoms. The middle shoal lies in 42° 56' north latitude and 68°\r\n52' west longitude. From this the south shoal bears S. by E. and the\r\nnorth shoal NNE., each being 3 1/4 miles distant from it. The water\r\nbreaks on these in rough weather and, though of small extent, they are\r\ndangerous to passing vessels bound from Cape Sable to Massachusetts\r\nports, across whose course they lie directly. Except for these shoals,\r\nthe water ranges from 15 to 60 fathoms. The ground is more or less\r\nbroken, and the bottom is of sand, pebbles, and rocks.\r\n\r\nThe principal fishing on these grounds is for cod, haddock, hake, and\r\ncusk; the cod and cusk are present the year around, the cod being most\r\nabundant in February, March. and April in an average depth of 60\r\nfathoms. The hake are found on the muddy edges in summer, with a lesser\r\nnumber present all the year. Haddock are present in considerable numbers\r\nfrom November to February, and sometimes a good school occurs in\r\n20-fathom depths in April. The arrival of the dogfish usually puts a\r\ntemporary ending to the fishing here in the last days of June or early\r\nIn July, to be resumed again when these pests have moved inshore.\r\nFormerly halibut were reported as seen rarely, but of late years they\r\nhave been found among the kelp in 15 to 18 fathoms on the shoal nearly\r\nthe year around, the fish ranging in size from 5 to 40 pounds, rarely\r\nlarger. Halibut of larger size are taken occasionally in fairly good\r\nnumbers in 30 to 50 fathoms in May and June. Perhaps this species is\r\nmore abundant on this and neighboring grounds than is generally\r\nrealized. At all events, certain Portland vessels have recently taken\r\ngood fares of halibut when fishing for them here in the season named.\r\nCusk are present in the deep water the year around. As is the case with\r\nmost of the detached ridges in this gulf, the cusk is the most abundant\r\nof the fish present about the middle of March. continuing in good\r\nnumbers through May. In herring years these fish usually occur in good\r\nnumbers on this ground In late May, and a considerable number of these\r\n(food fish or large herring) are taken here by seiners at this season.\r\nMackerel are generally abundant on these grounds In those years when\r\nthese fish occur In normal quantities on this coast.\r\n\r\nVessels operating on Cashes Bank range in size from 15 to 50 tons,\r\nprincipally from Maine ports, with a fair number of them from Gloucester\r\nand Boston, especially in winter. Of late years a few gill-netters have\r\nfished here, and these craft are using these grounds in steadily\r\nincreasing numbers.\r\n\r\nA comparatively little known and apparently as yet unnamed ridge lies E.\r\nby S. 15 miles from the buoy on Cashes Ledge, which is reported to be\r\ngood fishing ground, especially for cod and cusk. With both species\r\npresent here the year around, the cod is said to be most abundant in\r\nApril and May: and the cusk, as is the rule on these outlying ridges,\r\nappears in largest numbers in March and April. Haddock seem to be\r\nsomewhat rare here.\r\n\r\nThis ridge lies in a SE. and NW. direction, extending somewhat\r\nindefinitely but for at least 10 miles by about 3 miles in width. On the\r\nridge the bottom is broken--a hard bottom of black gravel, which\r\nusually means a good fishing spot--the depths here being from 85 to 90\r\nfathoms. There are numerous muddy spots between these harder pieces of\r\nground where soundings run to 100 fathoms or slightly more. The\r\nsurrounding bottom is mostly of mud, and the depths average from 100 to\r\n125 fathoms. There are a number of pieces of gravelly hard ground in the\r\nvicinity, each of which probably would furnish equally good fishing for\r\ncod and cusk at the same seasons as on the ridge.\r\n\r\nDue E. from the buoy on Ammens Rock about 12 miles lies a ridge that\r\nrises from the 100 to 120 fathom depths about it to a depth of about 80\r\nfathoms over a bottom of broken ground, mud, and shells. This shoaler\r\npiece is some 3 miles long. N. by E. and S. by NW., by 1 mile wide. It\r\nfurnishes good fishing for cod, hake, and cusk in the spring, April\r\nbeing the best season.\r\n\r\nA ridge lying NW. of Cashes Bank and nearly parallel with the main bank,\r\nonly separated by a narrow deep channel, is about 7 miles long by 1½\r\nmiles wide. The species and the seasons are the same here as on Cashes\r\nBank.\r\n\r\nBig Ridge (near Cashes Bank). This is a broken and rocky piece of\r\nbottom running from the tip of the southeastern part of the ground, at\r\nabout 10 miles S. from the buoy on Ammens Rock and about 82 miles SE. ½\r\nS. from the lightship at Portland, to a point about 20 miles S. by E.\r\nfrom the buoy named. Its length is not to be stated definitely, and it\r\nis probably greater than here shown. The width averages about 1½ to 2\r\nmiles. Depths are from 65 to 80 fathoms and more, increasing gradually\r\nas it goes away from the main bank. The species and their seasons of\r\nabundance here are as on Cashes Bank. Perhaps this is more of a cod and\r\ncusk ground than is the main part of Cashes Bank, the cusk being\r\nparticularly abundant during March and April. Halibut also are found\r\nhere in May and June in from 50 to 60 fathoms of water. A considerable\r\namount of the fish shown in the table of the catch from the area\r\nincluded in Cashes Bank may very well have come from this piece of\r\nground.\r\n\r\nAnother big ridge, paralleling the 100-fathom curve of Georges Bank at\r\nabout 20 miles N. of it, lies SE by S from the buoy on Cashes Ledge,\r\nforty miles to its center; SE by S 110 miles from Portland Lightship;\r\nESE 92 miles from Cape Ann to its western end, and E. by S. ½ S. from\r\nthe ship at Boston 100 miles. This ridge also is of somewhat indefinite\r\narea, being perhaps 20 miles long in an ESE by WNW direction by 1½ to\r\nthree miles wide. Apparently depths are fairly uniform from 85 to 95\r\nfathoms, the bottom of the ridge being of coarse black sand and having\r\nblue mud in the deeper area around it. This is said to be a good cod and\r\ncusk ground the year round.\r\n\r\nJohn Dyers Ridge. This lies 14 miles S. by E. from Toothakers Ridge, 40\r\nmiles S. by E. from Monhegan Island, and 7 miles NE. from Cashes Bank.\r\nIt is about 5 miles long by 2 miles wide, lying in an ENE. and WSW.\r\ndirection. The water is shoalest on the western edge, where are from 45\r\nto 50 fathoms over a sharp, pebbly bottom; thence the ground slopes to\r\nthe NE. into 75 and 80 fathoms over a hard, gravelly, and muddy bottom,\r\nin all other directions falling off sharply to 90 and 100 fathom\r\nsoundings over a muddy bottom.\r\n\r\nThis is essentially a cod ground for the entire year, the species being\r\nmost abundant from May 1 to November. It is a cusk ground all the year\r\non the hard bottom of the deeper parts, March and April showing the\r\nlargest schools. Hake also are abundant in 70 fathoms and deeper on the\r\nmud in summer and fall.\r\n\r\nFifty-five Fathom Bunch. West of Cashes Bank is a rocky ridge\r\nextending ENE. and WSW. about 4 miles and having a width of about 1\r\nmile. This is mainly a cod ground, the seasons for the species being as\r\non Cashes Bank.\r\n\r\nFippenies Bank. This consists of two shoals averaging 80 fathoms in\r\ndepth with a channel of 90 fathoms between them. These run NE. and SW.,\r\nthe eastern shoal about 8 miles long by 1 mile wide, the western about\r\nhalf as large. Fippenies bears E. 1/4 S. from Thacher Island, distant 61\r\nmiles; from Portland Lightship, SE. by S. ½ S, 57 miles to the western\r\npoint of the northern shoal in 35 fathoms. The bank is nearly 10 miles\r\nlong NE. and SW. and averages 4½ miles wide. The bottom is of gravel,\r\npebbles, and clay, having depths over much of the shoal of about 30\r\nfathoms but also from 36 to 60 fathoms. It is fished by the shore fleet\r\nin the spring and early summer. The fish and seasons are as on Cashes\r\nBank. Formerly twice as many haddock were taken here as on Cashes or on\r\nPlatts Bank, but this has changed in recent years. Halibut are taken\r\nhere in fair numbers in 45 to 55 fathom depths in June, July, and August\r\non the \"black gravel\" of the southern and western edge. The \"white\r\ngravel\" on the north shoal is of little account as a fishing ground,\r\nsince it is composed mostly of the shells of dead scallops.\r\n\r\nThe Ridge (on the southern part of Fippenies). This is SSE. from the\r\nlight-ship at Portland 75 miles and has a bottom of yellow mud and\r\npebbles and depths of 75 to 95 fathoms. Cod are present here in December\r\nand January; cusk the year around, but most numerous in February and\r\nMarch; haddock in December and January; hake in September and October.\r\nThe length of this bank is from 4 to 5 miles and the width somewhat less\r\nthan 2 miles. It lies in an ENE. and WSW. direction.\r\n\r\nMaurice Lubee's Ground. This lies outside of New Ledge (Platts Bank) 47\r\nmiles SSE. from the lightship at Portland. Extending in an ENE. and WSW.\r\ndirection, its boundaries are somewhat indefinite. It is perhaps 8 miles\r\nlong by 3 miles wide and has depths from 95 to 110 fathoms over a bottom\r\nconsisting mostly of mud.\r\n\r\nCusk are plentiful here in the spring, with a few in the fall. Cod are\r\ntaken all the year around, the Spring school being the largest. Hake are\r\nmost numerous In the spring and fall months, and haddock are not common\r\nbut are most numerous in winter.\r\n\r\nApparently the abundance of cod on this ground is due to the great\r\nquantity of shrimps and soft-shelled crabs found on the muddy bottom and\r\non the rocks that compose this ground. There seem to be many of these\r\ndeep-water grounds between and about the shoaler grounds, as near\r\nCashes, Fippenies, and Jeffreys, which apparently serve as fairways over\r\nwhich the schools of hake, cod, and cusk, move from Georges Bank into\r\nthe Gulf of Maine in the spring of the year.\r\n\r\nHarvey Blacks Ridge. This is SE. ½ S. from the lightship off\r\nPortland, distant 42 miles, and SE. from New Ledge, distant 8 miles.\r\nFrom Glovers Rock, off Small Point, Me. this ridge lies SE. by S. ½ S.\r\n41 miles. It extends in an ENE. and WSW. direction about 4 miles long by\r\nI mile wide. Depths average 70 to 100 fathoms over a bottom of yellow\r\nclay and gravel. Cod are taken here all the year. Haddock are found in\r\nthe deep water in the spring: cusk all the year in deep water, together\r\nwith hake in summer, also on the muddy bottom in deep water. Pollock and\r\nother surface-schooling fish are found here in their proper season.\r\n\r\nThe Cod Ridge (formerly Outer Harris Ground). This lies NE. from the\r\nNortheast Peak of New Ledge, distant 7 miles. It extends in an ENE. and\r\nWSW. direction, the ground narrowing and the water deepening to the\r\neastward, the shoal ground having 45 fathoms on a bottom of small\r\npebbles and fine black gravel and sand, depths increasing in all other\r\ndirections to 100 fathoms on the mud and sloping off somewhat steeply,\r\nespecially on the southeast side, where the drop is very sharp. The\r\nlength of the ground is about 5 miles, the width 1 mile. This is an\r\nall-the-year cod ground, the season of greatest abundance being from May\r\n1 to November. The haddock are usually In their greatest numbers here\r\nfrom January 1 to April. Apparently no large number of cusk or hake are\r\ntaken here on the ridge, perhaps because the water is not deep enough\r\nfor the former, except for the small fish, which are of little value to\r\nthe fishermen; and the ground is not muddy enough for the latter\r\nspecies. Both species, however, are found about the edges in the deep\r\nwater, the cusk on the sharpest, hardest part of the bottom (perhaps\r\nmost common in February and March), the hake, as usual, on the muddy\r\nparts about it.\r\n\r\nThree-Dory Ridge. Outside of New Ledge and about midway between it and\r\nHarvey Blacks Ridge is a small ridge about 3 miles long, running NE. and\r\nSW., and about ½ mile wide. This lies SE. by S. from the Portland\r\nLightship. 38 miles to the shoal of 55 fathoms, which is near its\r\ncenter. From this the ground slopes away on all sides to 63 and 65\r\nfathom depths over which area the bottom is made up of sand, gravel,\r\nmud, and rocks. At these lower depths are found \"pipes\" (clay\r\ncylinders), where the fishing ends abruptly. All about the ridge are\r\ndepths of 80 to 100 fathoms on a bottom of mud. This is almost entirely\r\na cod ground, good from May to August.\r\n\r\nPlatt's Bank or New Ledge.  This bears E. by N. ½ N. from Thacher\r\nIsland, from which the shoal portion of the ledge is distant 53 miles.\r\nFrom Portland Lightship it is 30 miles SSE. to the center of the ground.\r\nThe bank is about 12 miles long, NE. and SW.. and about 8 miles wide.\r\nThe western shoal, which is of small extent and rocky and which has a\r\nconsiderable amount of dead shells upon it, is situated near the center,\r\nits depth being 29 fathoms. From this shoal to the Southwest Peak is\r\nabout 11 miles SW. by S. Another shoal lies E. 3 miles, having about 30\r\nfathoms over sand and gravel, which is a good fall ground for haddock.\r\nEast-northeast from the western shoal 3 miles brings us to a rocky\r\nridge, with spots of hard mud and pebbles between, in 65-fathom depth,\r\nwhich is a fine winter cusk ground, these fish remaining here until\r\nApril. Over much of the bank the depths range from 30 to 35 fathoms with\r\na bottom of rocks and gravel. From the edge of the shoaler area the\r\nbottom slopes gradually to 50 or 60 fathoms, beyond which it drops\r\nsuddenly to 80 or 90 fathoms over a muddy bottom.\r\n\r\nThis was considered one of the very best fishing grounds for cod and\r\nhaddock in the Gulf of Maine, but the haddock catch here has fallen off\r\nrecently. Hake also are very abundant during the summer months and often\r\nduring October on the muddy bottom near the edge. Inside 100 fathoms, on\r\na \"punkin\" bottom of rocks and gravel, near the mud, haddock are found\r\nfrom December to March. Cod, pollock, and cusk occur from May to\r\nOctober, the former on the rocky and gravelly portions, the latter on\r\nthe deep soundings, with the Northeast Peak the best summer ground. This\r\nis also an especially good fall and winter ground for haddock. Halibut\r\nare often found in 35 fathoms (small fish) from September through\r\nNovember; also In spring and early summer. This ground is fished by\r\nvessels from Cape Cod, Mass., to Cutler, Me., mainly by trawling, some\r\nhand-lining, but no gill netting of importance as yet.\r\n\r\nJeffreys Ledge.  Jeffreys Ledge may be considered one of the best\r\nfishing grounds in the Gulf of Maine, although of comparatively small\r\nsize. It appears to be an extension of the shoal ground that makes off\r\nin an easterly direction from Cape Ann, it is about 20 miles long in a\r\nNE. and SW. direction and about 4 miles wide. Its southern limits is 42°\r\n54' and its northern limit 43° north latitude; its eastern and western\r\nboundaries may be placed at 69° 58' and 70° 18' west longitude. The\r\nbottom is rocky on the shoaler parts, with gravel and pebbles on the\r\nedges. Depths on the bank are from 27 to 35 fathoms, falling off to 40\r\nor 50 on the edges. The shoalest water lies from 4 to 5 miles N. by E.\r\nfrom the buoy, where there is 22 fathoms. Ordinarily there is little or\r\nno tide, with an occasional current SW. There are, however, strong\r\nwesterly currents with the heavy easterly winds, and often after a\r\nperiod of mild weather with no strong tides there will suddenly develop\r\na heavy SW. flow, indicating the approach of a strong northwester. This\r\nseems a general rule in the Gulf of Maine and is, perhaps, prevalent\r\nover much of our North Atlantic coast.\r\n\r\nJeffreys Ledge bears S. ½ W. from the lightship off Portland, 19 miles\r\nto the northern edge and 22 miles S. from the buoy on the Hue and Cry to\r\nthe edge of the shoal.\r\n\r\nA small cove makes for a short distance into the western side of\r\nJeffreys Ledge at about 20 miles from Boon Island in a SE. by S. ½ S.\r\ndirection. The bottom in the cove is broken and muddy, with depths of\r\nabout 60 fathoms. Thence, the ground slopes away to the mouth, where the\r\nedges about the entrance are rocky and have 70 and 75 fathom depths.\r\nThese rocky areas are cusk grounds in January, February, and March,\r\nduring which months the cove itself usually furnishes good haddock\r\nfishing. Outside these depths the water deepens westward over a muddy\r\nbottom, where are from 80 to 90 and even 100 fathoms of water. Fishing\r\nhere is mainly by trawl and gill nets.\r\n\r\nLying about SE. by S. ½ 5. from the Isle of Shoals 20 miles, 13 miles S.\r\nby W. from the whistling buoy on Jeffreys, and 43 miles S. by W. from\r\nCape Elizabeth is a broken piece of bottom having from 75 to 85 fathoms\r\nof water over it, which is a haddock ground from January to April and a\r\ncusk and hake ground all the year.\r\n\r\nA small shoal in the western part of the Cove of Jeffreys, having 50\r\nfathoms over a bottom of blue clay and rocks and rising from the 60 and\r\n70 fathom soundings about it, is about 1½ miles long by about 3/4 mile\r\nwide. This shoal is SSE. from Boon Island 15 miles. It is a winter\r\nground for cod and haddock.\r\n\r\nClay Ridge. At various points about the edges of Jeffreys Ledge are\r\nsmall detached ridges, which in their season are good fishing grounds.\r\nThe present piece of ground lies 26 miles S. by W. from the lightship at\r\nPortland, which course and distance bring us to the northern edge. There\r\nis a 50-fathom shoal of small size upon it, but elsewhere soundings\r\naverage from 65 to 70 fathoms over a bottom of hard clay. The length of\r\nthe ground is about 4 miles NNE. and SSW., and the breadth about 1 mile.\r\nThis furnishes good haddocking in January, February. and March. the\r\nlatter month showing the best fishing.\r\n\r\nJerry Yorks Ridge. This lies just inside and paralleling Jeffreys\r\nLedge WNW. from its shoal water and about 5 miles distant from the ledge\r\nand about 18 miles SE. by S. ½ S. from Cape Porpoise. This ground has\r\nfrom 45 to 48 fathoms of water on a rocky broken bottom. It is about 5\r\nmiles long, NNE. and SSW., and averages 1½ miles wide. This is a good\r\ncod and haddock ground In the fall and up to January, these fish\r\nreturning here in the spring months.\r\n\r\nHoward Nunans Ridge. Of similar nature to the last, this rises 4 miles\r\ninside of and parallel to it, lying 14 miles from Cape Porpoise on the\r\nsame bearings (SE. by S. ½ S.). This appears to be made up of two\r\nshoals, the northern rising to 50 fathoms of water over a rocky, broken\r\nbottom about 3 miles long by 1 mile wide, deepening southwesterly to a\r\nnarrow, muddy gully, where are 80 fathoms, and rising again to 60\r\nfathoms over rocks and broken ground. The whole ground is about 8 miles\r\nlong with average widths of from 1 to 1½ miles. This ground furnishes\r\ngood cod fishing and haddocking in the fall and early winter and again\r\nin the spring months.\r\n\r\nSoutheast Jeffreys. Off the southeast edge of Jeffreys, about 24 miles\r\nSE. from Boon Island, lies a piece of fishing ground having a hard\r\nbottom of sand, gravel, and rocks, where depths slope away gradually\r\nfrom the 50-fathom soundings near the main body of the bank to the\r\n90-fathom mark farther out. This area is a good ground for cod and\r\nhaddock in the winter and spring and a hake ground in March. This\r\nfishing spot is about 3 or 4 miles square and is bounded on all but the\r\nwestern side by muddy bottom, which is of little value as a fishing\r\nground. Usually there is good haddocking in March on the outside of\r\nJeffreys, on its southeastern edge and in the cove between it and\r\nTillies in 60 and 70 fathom depths on a broken and muddy bottom. This\r\nspot lies SE ½ from the Isle of Shoals, 27 miles to the center.\r\n\r\nEastern Shoal Water of Cape Ann. This is generally considered a part of\r\nJeffreys and is often spoken of as West Jeffreys by the fishermen. It\r\nextends In an ENE. direction from Cape Ann for a distance of from 15 to\r\n18 miles. It is, in fact, a southwest continuation of Jeffreys Ledge,\r\nthe two forming a nearly continuous ridge running NE. from Cape Ann a\r\ndistance of about 42 miles. Depths on the so-called Eastern Shoal Water\r\nvary from 20 to 45 fathoms, the bottom being of rocks, pebbles, and\r\ncoarse gravel over most of its extent. Sand and mud occur on the edges.\r\nThe eastern part of the ground is resorted to by the haddock fleet\r\nduring the fall and early winter, and other parts are visited more or\r\nless during the entire year for cod, haddock, and pollock by vessels and\r\nboats from Cape Ann and by craft of various types from Boston and\r\nPortland-line trawlers, gill-netters, and a few of the new type of small\r\notter trawlers, this latter fleet of craft constantly growing in number.\r\n\r\nOn the ledge cod, haddock, and cusk are taken in the full winter and\r\nspring, winter, perhaps, furnishing the best fishing. There are also\r\nmore or less pollock, and hake constitute an important part of the\r\ncatch. In those seasons when herring make their appearance in these\r\nwaters the seiners make good catches here, mostly of food fish, as the\r\nlarge herring are termed by the trade. The mackerel, also, appear on\r\nthese grounds and on the smaller grounds nearer to shore to northward\r\nand westward in good-sized schools, usually from July 1 through\r\nSeptember. For many years the haddock catch from this bank has been of\r\nconsiderable importance, and this statement remains true for recent\r\nyears as well.\r\n\r\nFormerly this fishery was almost entirely carried on by trawlers and\r\nhand-liners, but the gill-net fishery on these grounds is of great and\r\nsteadily growing importance. Of late the larger part of the haddock\r\ncatch has been taken by the \"otter-trawl\" method, this gear being\r\noperated by steamers of considerable size and upon the more distant\r\ngrounds, such as Georges Bank, the South Channel, and the Western Bank.\r\nThe same change to fishing grounds farther offshore has to a great\r\nextent taken place in the fleet of larger sailing vessels, thus leaving\r\nJeffreys and other inshore banks to the smaller craft; except that, with\r\nthe high prices of haddock and cod in the winter months, it is often\r\nprofitable for these larger vessels to run off to near-by banks for one\r\nset and return to port the same day.\r\n\r\nOn the inner parts of this ground, particularly, the gill-net fleet\r\noperates extensively, mainly in the full and spring, on northwest\r\nJeffreys 8 to 12 miles E. and SE. from Thacher Island, where the bottom\r\nis sand and rocks. Other gill-netting grounds are 8 to 15 miles NE. by\r\nE. from Thacher Island in 22 fathoms on a hard bottom of mud and mixed\r\nmaterial of sand and gravel. The Cove of Jeffreys, NE. by E. 12 to 15\r\nmiles from Thacher Island, is a favorite haddock ground in the spring\r\n(April 20 to May 15) in 45 to 70 or even 80 fathoms, although gill nets\r\nare not often fished in more than 50 fathoms because of the, weight of\r\nthe nets in the deeper water. In the spring (in April and May), the\r\nhaddock come in on Scantum, 10 miles NNE. from Thacher Island between\r\nJeffreys Ledge and the Isle of Shoals, on a broken bottom of rocks and\r\nblue clay in 55 to 70 fathoms.\r\n\r\nOff Newburyport and N. and SW. of the Isle of Shoals are gill-netting\r\ngrounds that are much used. Trawling and netting are carried on,\r\nbeginning in 40 fathoms in February and March and working off to 70\r\nfathoms off Salisbury Bench in May. Cod are on this ground about two\r\nweeks in October and in February and March are found in abundance off\r\nBoars Head. Hake are present here all the fall and are found all along\r\nthe southeast side of these grounds in depths of 45 to 60 fathoms. A\r\ncertain amount of halibut may be taken in most years at various points\r\non a bottom of hard gravel in spring and early summer in 35 to 65\r\nfathoms. In most years a large amount of mackerel is taken on Jeffreys,\r\nnotably so in 1925. Herring, also, are usually abundant here in \"herring\r\nyears\".\r\n\r\nThe Shoal Ground, stretching easterly from Thacher Island, has depths\r\nfrom 20 to 30 fathoms over a bottom of sand and gravel. This area is\r\nabout 15 miles long by 5 miles wide and is an important pollock ground\r\nin their spawning time as well as a good fall cod-fishing ground. It is\r\nabout 12 miles E. by N. from Thacher Island to its center and 21 miles\r\nSE. by S. from the Isle of Shoals. Flounder draggers also operate here\r\non the shoal ground and all around Thacher Island but mostly to eastward\r\n& southeastward.\r\n\r\nTillies Bank. [13] This bears E & S from Eastern Point Light just\r\ndropping Thacher Island Light, then 3 miles farther for best fishing:\r\nand E. by S. ½ S. from Thacher Island, Cape Ann, from which the shoal on\r\nthe center of the ground is distant 18 miles. This is a small rocky spot\r\nwith depths of from 25 to 28 fathoms, outside of which the water deepens\r\nto 40 fathoms over a considerable area. The length of the entire ground\r\nis about 10 miles in an E. and W. direction and the width about 5 miles.\r\nAt the edge it falls off rapidly to depths of 50 to 60 fathoms before\r\nreaching the mud at still greater depths but an area of shoal water\r\nconnects this ground with West Jeffreys. The bottom is rocky and rough\r\nover the greater part of the bank. Tillies was formerly regarded as one\r\nof the best fishing grounds off Cape Ann and is still resorted to for\r\ncod and haddock in the spring and fall; for hake in the spring, summer,\r\nand fall, and for pollock in the spring and fall. The fishing is mainly\r\nby trawling, with the gillnetters operating on the shoal grounds in less\r\nthan 50 fathoms.\r\n\r\nStellwagen Bank also called Middle Bank. This separates Massachusetts\r\nBay from the open water of the Gulf of Maine and extends from near Cape\r\nAnn nearly to Cape Cod. The center of this ground bears S by E ½ E from\r\nThacher Island and N by W ½ W from Highland Light, Cape Cod. The\r\nSouthern Part of the Bank is distant 5½ miles from Race Point Cape\r\nCod, and its northwest prong reaches to within 12 or 15 miles of Eastern\r\nPoint Cape Cod. The shoaler portion, with depths from 9½ to 19\r\nfathoms, is 17½ miles long in a N by W and S by E direction and has a\r\nwidth of 4 miles. This part is sandy but the eastern slope, in depths of\r\nfrom 25 to 55 fathoms, consists of coarse sand gravel and pebbles. On\r\nthis gravelly slope cod and haddock have been taken plentifully over a\r\nlong term of years, the cod in the fall and spring and the haddock in\r\nthe winter months. On the southern end of the bank and between this and\r\nRace Point cod abound in fall and winter. The whole bank is also a\r\nmackerel ground when the fish are in these waters, the best in the\r\nseason averaging to be from July 15 through September.\r\n\r\nThis bank is now mainly an Italian boat ground and is used by small\r\ncraft from Boston and Gloucester. Gill-netting here is especially\r\nextensive in November and December, mostly for pollock. Netters operate\r\nabout 22 miles SSE. from Eastern Point in 22 to 25 fathoms on a hard\r\nbottom. Good pollock catches are made in 25 to 40 fathoms on the eastern\r\nand southeastern slopes in the latter part of November and early\r\nDecember. Haddock are here from November 1 to March 1 and from April 20\r\nto May 15. Cod are present all the year, the largest school occurring\r\nduring August, September and October. It is a cusk ground from November\r\nto March in the deeper water. What seems a somewhat unusual occurrence\r\nin these later years was the appearance of a considerable school of\r\nhalibut on the northern slope of Stellwagen during the last half of\r\nApril 1926, several small craft getting from 2,000 to 3,000 pounds in\r\ntheir fares.\r\n\r\nWild Cat Ridge. Very heavy tides sweep over this ground, making it\r\ndifficult to haul gear in fishing upon it, whence, it is said, comes the\r\nname. It lies NNE from Highland Light, Cape Cod, 18 miles to its\r\nsouthern edge; SE ½ S from Thacher Island 31 miles; and is about 7½\r\nmiles long in a north and south direction by about 3½ miles wide. The\r\nbottom is hard, of broken shells and sand, and depths are from 45 to 60\r\nfathoms. There are 100 fathom depths inside of the ground and from 100\r\nto 110 fathoms outside of it. Apparently, this is an all the year\r\nground for cod, cusk, and haddock, although but little fished at any\r\ntime other than the winter seasons.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Table 3--Outer Fishing Grounds, showing the principle species taken\r\nupon them.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: There has been some speculation as to the origin of the\r\nsomewhat unusual name of this bank. The writer would note that there was\r\nan Edward Tillie in the Company of Captain John Smith when he explored\r\nthis region in 1614 and a Tilly (perhaps the same person) who operated a\r\nfishing station at Cape Ann during the years 1624 and 1625.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGEORGES AREA\r\n\r\nEast side of Cape Cod. The sea bottom off the east side of Cape Cod is\r\nmainly sandy and slopes off gradually from the beach, reaching depths of\r\n30 to 40 fathoms at 5 to 7 miles from land. Below Chatham the slope is\r\neven more gradual. Within these limits good catches of cod are taken\r\noccasionally, and to a less extent the same is true of haddock. Farther\r\nfrom the shore, in from 40 to 80 fathoms and from a point 8 or 10 miles\r\noff the Highlands of Cape Cod to another point lying 20 miles or more\r\nSSE. from Chatham Lights, is a continuous stretch of excellent haddock\r\ngrounds for winter fishing. The deep water off Chatham furnishes\r\nexcellent hake fishing in summer and fall.\r\n\r\nThis shore furnishes excellent mackerel fishing during most of the\r\nseason when these fish are in northern waters. Virtually no gill-netters\r\noperate here, the distance to market being great and the chance of rough\r\nweather and the lack of safe harbor making it dangerous for small craft.\r\nFrom this stretch of shore (mostly from off Chatham) there were landed\r\nat Boston in the year 1923, 66 fares with a total of 1,797,826 pounds\r\nvalued at $76,875.\r\n\r\nTobins. A name given to a piece of ground about 20 miles square lying\r\nS. by E. from the Highland Light. It runs from about 40 miles to about\r\n60 miles offshore, the depths gradually increasing as the bottom slopes\r\naway evenly from the shore from 75 to 95 fathoms over a bottom of clay,\r\nsand, and pebbles. Cod are taken here in the spring, summer, and fall,\r\nand haddock in February, March, and April. A few hake are taken here in\r\nsummer, but, as compared with the grounds off Chatham, this is not to be\r\nconsidered a hake ground.\r\n\r\nMorris Ledge. This lies eastward of Chatham and is a favorite ground\r\nfor certain cod fishermen during spring and early summer. Schooners and\r\nsmall craft operate here.\r\n\r\nOuter Crab Ledge. The center lies about 14 miles ESE from Chatham\r\nLights. It extends about 5 or 6 miles in a N. and S. direction and is\r\nabout 1 mile wide. Depths run from 19 to 23 fathoms; the bottom is\r\nrocky. The fishing is principally for cod in the fall, winter and\r\nspring. Vessel fishing here is principally in the spring.\r\n\r\nNantucket Shoals. This stretch of bars and deeper waters between,\r\nroughly triangular in form with its apex at the north, lies along the\r\nwestern edge of the South Channel, extending S. and SE. from the\r\nsouthern end of Cape Cod and Nantucket Island. From Monomoy Point to\r\nRogers Fishing Ground, on the eastern edge of Phelps Bank, it is SSE. 80\r\nmiles. Its width from Southeast Rips to the western edge of New South\r\nShoal is 40 miles. The area includes a number of \"fishing spots\" and\r\nshoals, among which the following are the most important: Pollock Rip\r\nGround, Rose and Crown Shoal, Great Rip, Davis Bank, Fishing Rip, Old\r\nand New South Shoal, and Phelps Bank.\r\n\r\nOn and about all these shoals the sail fleet makes good catches, mainly\r\nconsisting of cod but with a fair proportion of pollock, also, and in\r\nthe deeper water close to them, in spring and summer, a considerable\r\namount of haddock. An occasional large halibut is taken, and even good\r\ncatches have been reported. There were noted in the daily report of the\r\nBoston Fish Bureau between May 15 and August 15, 1920, 10 trips made by\r\nthe smaller vessels of the halibut fleet that landed fares of from 2,000\r\nto 10,000 pounds of this species from this area. Perhaps more would be\r\ntaken if the halibut fishery were to be followed here as in other areas.\r\n\"Rip fishing,\" as conducted here, is done \"at a drift,\" moving over the\r\nshoals and, as they move off from them, sailing back to repeat the\r\nprocess. The fish are taken by hand-lining with \"cockle\" bait or by\r\n\"jigging\" the fish with a shiny piece of metal representing a herring or\r\nsimilar fish, below which are set twin hooks, the fish being struck when\r\nit is felt investigating the lure. This fishery generally is carried on\r\nduring May, June, July, and August. In the mackerel and herring seasons\r\nthese grounds usually furnish good fishing for these species, the fish\r\nusually striking here from May 15 to July 15.\r\n\r\nPollock Rip Grounds. These lie between Pollock Rip Lightship and\r\nShovelful Lightship and extend northward to Pollock Rip Shoal. These\r\ngrounds are 3 miles long, E. and W., by 2 miles N. and S. The depths\r\nrange from 4 to 12 fathoms. These are fished from Monomoy and in stormy\r\nweather from Chatham instead of going to the Crab Ledge. Late in the\r\nspring and early in the fall the cod move inshore. In winter the cod\r\nleave Pollock Rip for the deeper water.\r\n\r\nRose and Crown Shoal. This is a small piece of ground 7 miles ESE.\r\nfrom Sankaty Head. The fishing area lies between the Round Shoal and\r\nRose and Crown buoys, making a stretch perhaps 6 miles long by 1½\r\nmiles wide. Sometimes good fishing may be had from 6 to 12 mile, from\r\nGreat Round Shoal buoy. As elsewhere on and about these shoals, the cod\r\nis the principal species caught, pollock being next in importance, and a\r\nfew haddock.\r\n\r\nNantucket Shoals, Madisons Spot. SSE. 13 miles front Round Shoal buoy,\r\nhas 9 fathoms over a smooth hard bottom of sand. It is about 3 miles\r\nlong, from SE. to NW. by 1½ miles wide. This is a flounder ground for\r\nthe greater part of the year and a good cod ground in October and\r\nNovember. As is the rule elsewhere in this neighborhood, tides are heavy\r\nover this ground.\r\n\r\nNantucket Shoal--Great Rip. Lies 13 miles E. by S. ½ S. from\r\nSankaty Head Light. Nantucket. It is 5 miles long from N, to S. and 3\r\nmiles broad. Over this area the depths are from 9 to 18 feet, but the\r\nfishing is done mainly around the edges in 6 to 12 fathoms where the\r\nbottom is gravel and shells covered with sponges and kelp. Here, as on\r\nall these shoals, the greater part of the fishing is done by that method\r\nknown as \"rip fishing.\" Cod are taken chiefly by hand-lining in May.\r\nJune, July, and August.\r\n\r\nNantucket Shoals; Davis Bank; Crab Bank. This is an irregular piece of\r\nbottom lying in a generally ENE. and WSW direction at about 20 miles\r\ndistance ESE from Sankaty Head. It is perhaps 14 miles long by 5 miles\r\nwide at its broadest. Depths upon it are from 4 to 9 fathoms, with\r\nsoundings of 12 to 18 about it, over a bottom of sand and broken shells.\r\n\r\nNantucket Shoals Fishing Rip is an elongate bank lying 29 miles SE. from\r\nSankaty Head Light. It is 10 miles long in a NE and SW direction and\r\nSoutheast Rip (Nantucket Shoals) lies SE. from Sankaty Head 35 miles. It\r\nhas depths from 8 to 10 fathoms over an area about 10 miles long by 2\r\nmiles wide, with from 22 to 30 fathoms over the sandy bottom around it.\r\n\r\nPhelps Bank. This bank lies 38 miles SE, ½ S. from Sankaty Head Light\r\nand agrees more or less in size, shape, trend, and character of the\r\nbottom with Fishing Rip. Depths are from 10 to 17 fathoms. On the\r\nsoutheast edge of this lies Rogers Fishing Ground, with 24 to 40 fathoms\r\nover fine gray sand. It is perhaps mainly a haddock ground.\r\n\r\nNantucket Shoals (South Shoal). This name is applied to the fishing\r\nground about Nantucket Lightship, which marks the Old South Shoal and\r\nthe New South Shoal, the two making a continuous reef of irregular form\r\nsome 10 to 12 miles in length and from 1 to 3 miles wide. The northern\r\nend of this lies about 12 miles S. by E. from Sankaty Head (the Old\r\nSouth Shoal), and the southern extremity of the New South Shoal reaches\r\nto about 20 miles S. ½ E. from the same point. The fishing ground lies\r\nmostly to the S. of these shoals and about the lightship, where otter\r\ntrawling is carried on in all directions from the ship except from N. to\r\nNE., where lie the vessels sunk by the German submarine in the late war.\r\nThis fishery is also carried on WNW. from the ship for a distance of 40\r\nmiles, even into 7 fathom depths near Muskeget Inlet.\r\n\r\nElsewhere depths average from 13 to 18 fathoms on the inner parts of the\r\ngrounds, whence they slope away gradually from the shore soundings into\r\n50, 80, or even more on the outer edge, where the ground falls away\r\nrapidly into the deeps. For the most part this area has a bottom of\r\nsand, but there are small stretches of coarse gravel, broken shells,\r\npebbles, and a few muddy spots.\r\n\r\nWithin comparatively recent years this ground has been much used by the\r\notter trawlers, which type of craft has developed a productive fishery\r\nhere, which is being operated in steadily increasing volume and takes a\r\ncatch that is predominantly of haddock.\r\n\r\nThe proportion of cod taken here by these vessels is very small, even\r\nsmaller than that from other grounds fished by the otter-trawl method.\r\nPollock and hake, too, make a small item in the fares from the\r\nneighborhood of the South Shoal. In the average otter-trawl fare haddock\r\nmakes up the greater part of the catch because, as a rule, this type of\r\ngear is operated mostly on the smooth, sandy bottom which this species\r\nprefers. The otter-trawl fishery here is at its best from early May\r\nthrough June, July, and the first halt of August. Few trips are reported\r\nfrom this ground at other seasons. Perhaps the haddock leaves the shoal\r\ngrounds here earlier than when it moves out of the same depths in The\r\nChannel.\r\n\r\nThe early fishing for the swordfish generally takes place in this\r\nvicinity, and in normal seasons mackerel are found here in abundance\r\nfrom May 15 to August, and, as is the custom with this uncertain fish,\r\nit may appear here again in the late fall.\r\n\r\nThe Channel. [14] The Channel marks the western edge of Georges Bank. Its\r\nboundaries are somewhat indefinite, but the old Eldridge chart states\r\nthat for the fishermen the 30 fathom curve running southerly from Race\r\nPoint. Cape Cod, limits its western edge. This ground is much visited by\r\nthe Boston fleet, both sail and steam, line trawlers and otter trawlers,\r\nthe fleet of Gloucester, and the otter-trawl fleet that has developed in\r\nNew York in recent years. This area is all good fishing ground in the\r\nproper season, but perhaps the most important is that part lying 25\r\nmiles E. ½ S. from Sankaty Head, Nantucket. Here is a level, sandy\r\nbottom, where, during May, June, July, and August, the otter trawlers\r\noperate successfully in 18 to 30 fathoms of water, making a catch that\r\nconsists principally of haddock, with a considerable proportion of cod,\r\nespecially in June and July, and with a fair amount also of pollock,\r\ncusk, and hake. Small halibut are fairly abundant here, also, these fish\r\nbeing of from 5 to R pounds, rarely larger. Flounders are abundant, with\r\na good number of \"lemon soles\" and \"gray soles,\" which are very popular\r\nwith the trade.\r\n\r\nThe sail fleet operates here also, but, as a rule, more of these vessels\r\nare found on the ground lying some 10 miles farther eastward, on the\r\nedge of Georges in somewhat deeper water (30 to 50 fathoms) on a rougher\r\nand rockier bottom, where there is a greater proportion of cod in the\r\ncatch than on the western area.\r\n\r\nThe Sankaty Head ground is about 20 miles long by about 8 miles wide,\r\nstretching from 55 miles SE. from Highland Light to 78 miles SE. by S\r\n½ S. from the same point (the bottom of the Channel), and is bounded\r\non all sides by pieces of bottom less favorable to the operation of the\r\notter trawl because of the presence of rocks, sponges, or other\r\nobstacles, which interfere with the free passage of the net over the\r\nbottom but offer less trouble to the line-trawl fishermen. A good spring\r\nhaddock ground lies ESE. 65 miles from the Highlands in 70 fathoms.\r\nbest in March and April. As the cold weather advances the fish move away\r\nin great part from these grounds, going into the deeper water, the\r\ncatches of the fall and winter months being taken mainly In depths of\r\nfrom 60 to 100 fathoms. At this season and in these depths the vicinity\r\nof the Corner of the Channel, Clarks Side. and the area N and W of the\r\nCultivator usually have a good winter school of haddock. This has been\r\nparticularly large during the past three year. (1923 to 1925). Thus, it\r\nmay be seen that the Channel is an important ground during most of the\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nThe figures of the catch from Clarks Bank have been shown together with\r\nthose of Georges Bank. of which, in fact, this area is a part.\r\n\r\nThe larger part of the sail fleet is found fishing on the grounds of\r\nthe eastern side of the Channel and of the western edge of Georges\r\nBank, in part to escape the damage that the otter trawlers cause to them\r\nin dragging away their gear. It is often impossible for these steamers\r\nto avoid some damage of this kind: especially is this the case in the\r\nthick weather so prevalent oil Georges. In the summer months of the\r\n\"mackerel years\" a large catch of this species is taken from the waters\r\nof the Channel.\r\n\r\nSt. Georges Bank, more generally known as Georges Bank. [15] This is\r\nby far the largest and most important fishing ground near the coast of\r\nthe United States and is second to none in the western Atlantic except\r\nthe Grand Bank of Newfoundland. It lies eastward of Cape Cod and\r\nNantucket Shoals and is apparently an extension of the latter, since the\r\nwater is no deeper between the southern part of the shoals and the\r\nwestern part of the bank than in many places upon it. Its southern\r\nlimit, as shown on the chart, is 40° 40' north latitude, though the\r\n50-fathom line extends 7 miles farther south. The southern limit,\r\ntherefore, may be considered to be about 40° 30' and the northern as 42°\r\n08' north latitude. The eastern part is in about 66° and the western in\r\nabout 69° west longitude. The greatest length from the northeastern to\r\nthe southwestern extremity is about 150 miles; the greatest width, N.\r\nand S., about 98 miles, according to the charts of the Coast Survey.\r\n\r\nDepths range from 2 to 50 fathoms. On the western part, between the\r\nparallels of 41° 10' and 41° 53' north latitude and the meridians of 87°\r\n20' and 68° 37' west longitude are a number of shoals, known as the East\r\nShoal, North Shoal, Southwest Shoal. Cultivator, etc. The Southwest\r\nShoal is the largest, being 15 miles long SSW and NNE., with an average\r\nwidth of 2½ miles. The position of the center of this shoal is 41°\r\n39' north latitude and 67° 48' west longitude. There are from 2 to 15\r\nfathoms of water on the shoals and between them are depths of from 12 to\r\n30 fathoms. The tide sweeps over these with great force, causing strong\r\nrips, and during rough weather the sea breaks heavily on them, rendering\r\napproach to their vicinity extremely hazardous.\r\n\r\nOver most of the bank the bottom is sand, although patches of rough\r\nground (gravel, pebbles, and rocks) of greater or less extent are found\r\nin some localities. Its position between the Bay of Fundy and the Gulf\r\nStream cause the tide to run swifter than on other banks and to swirl\r\naround instead of passing directly over, back and forth. The writer has\r\nseen two men have difficulty in holding an empty dory against the\r\ncurrent.\r\n\r\nThe Report on the Fishery Industry of the United States, in 1887, says\r\nthat the first attempt at fishing here (of which there is any record)\r\nwas made in 1821 by three Gloucester vessels. The cod and halibut\r\nindustry, according to the same authority, began in 1830, although not\r\nfully established as a permanent industry until 1835.\r\n\r\nThe area of the whole bank is approximately 8,050 square miles, all of\r\nwhich, except for the shoals, is available in summer for the taking of\r\ncod, haddock, cusk, halibut, and hake, with a considerable amount of\r\nmackereling and swordfishing, as well as the taking of other species.\r\n\r\nDuring February, March, and April large schools of cod make their\r\nappearance on the bank. At this season these are found most abundantly\r\non the \"Winter Fishing Ground\"; a part of Georges lying eastward and\r\nsoutheastward of the North Shoal between the parallels of 41° 30' and\r\n42° 00' north latitude and 66° 38' and 67° 30' west longitude. The area\r\nof this Winter Fishing Ground is about 1,100 square miles. This part of\r\nthe bank seems entirely given over to the codfish, since it is too\r\nbroken, sharp, and rocky to please the haddock. Depths here are from 30\r\nto 40 fathoms, deepening away from the North Shoal. This area is\r\nessentially a spawning ground for the cod, which appear to come on the\r\nhank from the SE., as they almost invariably, after reaching the ground,\r\nmove slowly to the N. and W. as spring approaches. This is in the\r\ndirection of the shoals. As soon as the spawning season is over the\r\nschools of cod break up, but more or less fish are caught on different\r\nparts of the ground at all times of the year, though rarely are they\r\nfound so plentiful as when the winter school is on the ground. Cod are\r\nfound along the Northern Edge virtually the year around, though many of\r\nthe winter school move on to the inner waters of the gulf and others go\r\nover to Browns Bank, where the early comers seem to appear in the first\r\ndays of April.\r\n\r\nIn its production Georges Bank itself is rather evenly divided between\r\nhaddock and cod, the cod showing a slightly larger proportion. The South\r\nChannel, on the western edge of Georges, shows predominantly as a\r\nhaddock ground, and the haddock from The Channel is considered a better\r\nfish than that from Georges. Georges Bank itself is also an important\r\nhaddock ground in the spring and early summer, when this species abounds\r\nabout the Cultivator Shoal (SE. by S. 88 miles from Highland Light. Cape\r\nCod) in depths from 18 to 30 fathoms; and at the same season along the\r\nNorthern Edge (140 to 200 miles E. by S. ½ S. from Boston Lightship in\r\nabout 41° to 42° N. lat. and 66° to 88° W. long.) in 45 to 80 fathoms in\r\nsummer, the fish moving off into the deeper water (90 to 100 fathoms) in\r\nthe neighborhood of the Corner of the Channel as the winter comes on.\r\nMany are found in March, when they return from the deep water, when\r\nfishing is carried on 65 miles SE. from Highland in 70 fathoms; then\r\nthey come into the 40-fathom depths from the North Shoal westward to the\r\nCorner of The Channel along the Northern Edge. In April the Cultivator\r\nCove is good ground even into 20-fathom depths.\r\n\r\nThe Southwest Part. (120 miles SSE. from Highland Light, Cape Cod,\r\nwith 45 to 80 fathom depths) is a good ground for haddock from the\r\nbeginning of the fall up to about Christmas, after which the best winter\r\nfishing for this species is found on the Southeast Part (reached by\r\nsteaming 145 miles ESE. from Boston Lightship in order to clear the\r\nshoals, then SSE. 40 to 50 miles, depending upon what part of the ground\r\nit is desired to fish). January is perhaps the best fishing month upon\r\nthis portion of Georges.\r\n\r\nWhile not considered a halibut ground, as compared with some of the\r\nother offshore banks, Georges can show a very considerable catch of this\r\nspecies. Because of its nearness to the markets it is more intensely\r\nfished than any other ground of equal area and by a far greater variety\r\nof crafts, most of which take a greater or less amount of halibut. The\r\notter-trawl fleet, both here and in The Channel, takes a large amount of\r\nthis species when its total catch is considered; and these fish are\r\nmainly small, of from 4 to 10 pounds in weight, with only rarely a\r\nlarger one. The salt fishers, also, and the rest of the market fleet\r\ncombine to make an imposing total of the poundage of halibut from\r\nGeorges and its vicinity. The Georges halibut is esteemed by the trade\r\nabove the halibut from other grounds. Perhaps its flesh may be superior,\r\nthough for what reason it is difficult to say, unless because, since the\r\ntrips to this ground average fewer days in length, the fish are received\r\nin the markets in a fresher condition than are those from more distant\r\nbanks.\r\n\r\nThe principal halibut grounds on Georges for the spring and summer\r\nmonths (April to July) lie between the Cultivator Shoal and the North\r\nShoal in depths from 10 to 18 fathoms, and E., S., and SW. from the\r\nNorth Shoal in the same soundings. This area is sometimes called Little\r\nGeorges. There are also a number of mussel grounds on the southwest part\r\nof Georges, having depths averaging 20 fathoms, all of which furnish\r\ngood feeding grounds and a substantial catch of halibut in the seasons\r\nwhen these fish are in the shoal water.\r\n\r\nDuring July and August the halibut are found along the Northern Edge,\r\nover a stretch of ground about 65 miles long in 60 to 100 fathoms; and\r\nfrom this time until the hard weather of the winter begins the fishing\r\ngoes on about the Northeast Peak (about 42° 00' N. and 66° 00' W.) over\r\nthe narrow area on the edge of the suddenly deepening water, beginning\r\nin from 60 to 70 fathoms, then out to 200 and even 300 fathoms. The\r\nwinter fishing on Georges is very difficult and somewhat hazardous, so\r\nthat the halibut fishery in these waters is rarely carried on or, at\r\nbest, by very few vessels after November or before March.\r\n\r\nMackerel are usually quite abundant on Georges in their season,\r\ngenerally being large or medium fish. Herring also are found there in\r\ngood number but are somewhat distant from market as fresh fish.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Table 4--Fishing grounds of the Georges Area, showing the principal\r\nspecies taken upon them.]\r\n\r\n\r\nBy far the largest percentage of the swordfish catch landed in the ports\r\nof Boston, Gloucester, and Portland comes from Georges Bank. A\r\nconsiderable portion of the fish listed from this ground under the\r\nheading \"Miscellaneous\" is made up of this species.\r\n\r\nThe swordfish arrive on Georges on the Southwest Part and on the\r\nSouthern Edge about June 5, and the traveling schools pass over the\r\nbank, northward bound, up to August 10. In fact, all through the season\r\nwhen they are present in northern waters, even up to November, they may\r\nbe found on Georges. Probably the best area of the bank for this species\r\nis on the parallel of 41° N., where the shoal rises steeply out of \"blue\r\nwater.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: Capt. John Smith wrote of this region: \"Toward the South\r\nand Southwest of this Cape (Cape Cod) is found a long and dangerous\r\nshoal of sands and rocks. But so far as I incircled it, I found thirtie\r\nfadom water aboard the shore, and a strong current; which makes mee\r\nthinke there is a Channell about the shoales; where is the best and\r\ngreatest fish to be had, Winter and Summer in all that Countree. But the\r\nSavages say there is no Channell; but that the shoales begin from the\r\nmain at Pawmet, to the Ile of Nausit; and so extends beyond their\r\nknowledge into the sea.\" That the captain's reputation for far-visioned\r\nwisdom may not be held too lightly, let these figures speak, taken as\r\nthey are from the bureau's records of the landings at the three ports of\r\nBoston, Gloucester. and Portland for the year 1927, when the fares from\r\nhis \"Channell\" numbered 2,036, with a poundage of 121,688,693 and a\r\nvalue of $3,607,358.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15. \"The earliest record of this name (Saint Georges Shoal)\r\nthat the writer has found appears upon a map discovered in the library\r\nof Simancas, in Spain, where a chart said to have been made by a\r\nsurveyor sent out to Virginia by James I of England, in 1610, was found\r\nin 1885 or 1888, after having long before disappeared from England. This\r\nchart is thought to embody, besides the work of Champlain and other\r\nforeigners, the information contained in the English charts of White,\r\nGosnold, Pring, and probably of Waymouth's Perfect Geographical Map. It\r\nis thought to have been drawn by Robert Tyndall or Captain Powell.\"\r\n_Genesis of the United States_. Alexander Brown.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOFFSHORE BANKS\r\n\r\nBrowns Bank. This bank lies in a northeastern direction from Georges\r\nand is separated from it by a gully 15 miles wide, in which the depths\r\nrange from 100 to 450 fathoms. Its area is about 2,275 square miles. The\r\ngreatest length, from SE to NW, is 63 miles and the greatest width is 43\r\nmiles. It is situated between 64° 52\" and 68° 29\" west longitude, and\r\n41° 50\" and 43° 02\" north latitude. There is a small rocky shoal on the\r\nnorthern part, on which, it is said, there is not 9 to 15 fathoms. The\r\nbank slopes away from the shoal, S. and E. to depths of 55 to 75\r\nfathoms, but at a distance of 12 or 15 miles off, it again rises to 30\r\nto 50 fathoms. This area of shoal water, within the 50 fathom limit, is\r\n50 miles long and has an average width of 15 miles. North of the shoal\r\nthe water deepens suddenly to 70 and 80 fathoms. The bottom is largely\r\ncoarse sand, gravel, pebbles, and rocks and is rich in animal life. The\r\narea of the bank is approximately 1,370 square geographical miles.\r\n\r\nTides here are quite as strong as on the eastern side of Georges Bank,\r\nthe ebb having an average strength of 1 1/3 miles an hour and the flood\r\nis somewhat stronger. The greatest strength of the flood tide sets W.\r\nthe ebb in nearly an opposite direction.\r\n\r\nHaddock, cod, cusk, halibut, pollock and hake are the principal food\r\nfishes procured from this bank, ranking in volume in the order named. In\r\nvalue, however, halibut takes third place in the list. Cod are plentiful\r\nhere in winter, though fewer vessels fish here than on Georges Bank, at\r\nthat season. At other seasons the codfishery on Browns Bank compares\r\nfavorably with that of other banks in the vicinity. Cod are present the\r\nyear around, in May and June feeding in depths of about 40 fathoms,\r\ngoing into 80 fathoms in August, and into depths of about 100 fathoms in\r\ncold weather.\r\n\r\nHaddock, also, are present all the year, the period of greatest\r\nabundance being usually January and February. In March and April they\r\nare most abundant in 27 to 30 fathoms; at other seasons they are in 50\r\nfathoms and deeper, especially in winter, when generally they can be\r\nfound in 80 to 100 fathoms. Cusk are present in the deep water all the\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nOlder reports say (1880-81): \"Halibut were formerly found here in\r\nabundance, but at present the fishery is limited to an occasional trip\r\noff the southern and western edge.\" It will be noted that a fair amount\r\nof halibut was taken here during 1923, when this bank ranked third in\r\nvolume of halibut taken, which seems a good showing when the\r\ncomparatively small size of the ground is considered. Fairly good\r\ncatches have been made SW from the Northwest Peak of Browns, about 66°\r\n50' west longitude and 42° 40' north latitude, along the 100-fathom\r\ncurve and following eastward to the southward of La Have and beyond,\r\nperhaps to 63° west longitude. The Southeast Peak is perhaps the most\r\nproductive of the halibut grounds here, \"setting\" off from the shoaler\r\nparts into the narrow deep-water channel between this and Georges\r\nperhaps 20 miles distant.\r\n\r\nA considerable part of the fish listed under the heading \"Miscellaneous\"\r\n are swordfish, which come upon this bank during their summer\r\nwanderings.\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that the number of otter-trawl fares from this ground\r\nis small. It is only in recent years that this method of fishing has\r\nbeen employed here, the bottom having been thought to be too rough for\r\nthe successful operation of gear of this type upon it.\r\n\r\nSeal Island Ground. This is called also on the charts in its northwest\r\npart, the German Bank and lies off the western part of Nova Scotia. Very\r\nfew charts show it, as it is somewhat difficult to define its exact\r\nlimits. It is a direct continuation of the shore soundings, which slope\r\ngradually from the land to the S. and W. and continue in a northerly\r\ndirection beyond what might be considered the bounds of the grounds. To\r\nthe S. it extends nearly to Browns Bank, from which it is separated by a\r\nnarrow gully 70 to 80 fathoms deep. To the N. it reaches 38 miles beyond\r\nSeal Island and to the NW. about 35 miles from the same island. The\r\nsouthern limit of the ground is in 43° and the northern 43° 45' north\r\nlatitude, while the western boundary may be placed at 66° 40' west\r\nlongitude. The entire ground outside the 3 mile limit covers an area of\r\n1,250 miles.\r\n\r\nThere is a small shoal called Pollock Rip, with a depth of 7 fathoms,\r\nbearing SW from Seal Island, distant 9½ miles; but otherwise the ground\r\nslopes quite gradually, the depths being from 15 to 70 fathoms. The\r\nbottom is mainly coarse gravel and pebbles with occasional rocky spots\r\nof greater or less extent. The tides sweep over this ground with\r\nconsiderable force out from and in toward the Bay of Fundy. the flood\r\nrunning strongest.\r\n\r\nIn general, the species of fish found here and the seasons of their\r\ngreatest abundance are much as on Browns Bank. The principal fishes\r\ntaken are haddock, cod, cusk, halibut, and hake, and a very small amount\r\nof pollock. Except for the haddocking, the best fishing season is from\r\nMarch to October. Halibut are said to have been very plenty here in the\r\npast but are said to have been comparatively rare in recent years,\r\nalthough occasional good fares are brought from these grounds, perhaps\r\nmore commonly in the spring and early summer and a few at other seasons.\r\nIn April they are found most commonly in 80 fathom depths; in May in 30\r\nto 40 fathoms, in June the best halibuting is had in 25-fathom depths or\r\neven in shoaler water. (The halibut catch shown for the year chosen\r\n(1927) is unusually small, most years yielding a fair amount of this\r\nspecies from this ground. Apparently no member of the American halibut\r\nfleet visited this ground for the year.)\r\n\r\nCod are present here the year around, perhaps the best fishing taking\r\nplace in May and June, when the fish are found in about 40 fathoms They\r\ngo into deeper water, about 60 fathoms, in August and into 100 fathoms as\r\nthe cold weather advances. This Seal Island ground may be considered\r\nessentially as a feeding ground for the cod, which seem to appear here\r\nafter the spawning season is over, to fatten upon the crabs and mollusks\r\nliving on the bottom and on the herring and other small fish that swim\r\nback and forth In the tide rips.\r\n\r\nHaddock are also present all the year, the schools being most abundant\r\nand the number greatest in January and February, when the fish are in\r\nabout 50 to 60 fathoms. Apparently they come into depths of from 27 to\r\n30 fathoms in March and April for spawning.\r\n\r\nCusk are present here during most of the year in 80 fathoms on the hard\r\nbottom. Pollock are few on this ground at any time of the year. This\r\nspecies, together with herring and mackerel, are abundant on the \"shore\r\nsoundings\" of Seal Island Ground, whence, following the abundant food\r\nfurnished by the smaller fish, they range a short distance in to the Bay\r\nof Fundy. Many mackerel are taken in the traps in the vicinity of\r\nYarmouth, Nova Scotia, which seems to mark the limit of their\r\npenetration in any considerable schools on the western shore of Nova\r\nScotia.\r\n\r\nWhat is apparently a gradually deepening extension of Seal Island Ground\r\nis found about 65 miles SSE. from Mount Desert Rock and 60 miles W. from\r\nSeal Island. There seems to be no distinguishing name for this area.\r\n\r\nThe depths here are from 70 to 100 fathoms over a broken bottom of mud,\r\ngravel, and in places fine sand. The ground falls off rapidly on all\r\nsides except toward Seal Island and the Nova Scotia coast, leaving an\r\narea at its end of somewhat indeterminate length, perhaps 18 or 20,\r\nmiles, and having a distance across of about 8 miles at its widest part.\r\n\r\nApparently there is no reason why this should not be an all-the-year\r\nfishing ground, but it seems not to be visited much in the winter. It\r\nfurnishes, however, a very good summer handline fishery for cod at\r\ndogfish time, and in the spring months it abounds in cod, cusk, and\r\nhake, all fish of large size.\r\n\r\nRoseway Bank. This bank lies N. of the western part of La Have and SE.\r\nof Shelbourne Light, Nova Scotia: 31 miles SSE. from the whistling buoy\r\noff Lockport, Nova Scotia, to the southeastern edge. It is oblong in\r\nshape and of small extent--about 270 square geographical miles. Its\r\ngreatest length is 21 miles and its greatest breadth 15 miles. It\r\nextends from 43° 12' to 43° 33' north latitude, and from 64° 25' to 64°\r\n52' west longitude and at the northwest corner is connected with the\r\nshore limit of 60 fathoms by a narrow neck. Depths are from 33 to 48\r\nfathoms. The bottom is of sand, gravel, and rocks; on the Northeast Peak\r\nthe bottom is of yellow mud and gravel.\r\n\r\nCurrents in this region are not nearly so strong as about Cape Sable and\r\nBrowns Bank, their general direction being WSW. and ENE the westerly\r\nmuch the stronger, though the force and direction of both are much\r\ninfluenced by the winds.\r\n\r\nThe principal fish taken here are cod, haddock, and cusk, but hake,\r\npollock and halibut occur, the best fishing months being from May to\r\nOctober, when the bank is resorted to by craft from western Nova Scotia.\r\nA few New England craft also fish here.\r\n\r\nLa Have Bank. Situated eastward of Browns Bank and S. and E. of\r\nRoseway Bank. It extends from 42° 34' to 43° 26' north latitude a\r\ndistance of 52 miles, and from 63° 50' to 65° 07' west longitude a\r\ndistance of about 54 miles. The bank is nearly divided into two\r\nportions, of which the eastern (La Have Bank proper) extends N and S. 39\r\nmiles and the western portion nearly E. and W. about 35 miles. The total\r\narea of the bank is about 1,200 miles.\r\n\r\nThe bottom is largely coarse gravel, pebbles, and rock, with smaller\r\nareas of sand distributed here and there. Depths run from 40 to 50\r\nfathoms. The general set of the currents is to the westward, but this is\r\nmuch influenced by the force and direction of the wind and is generally\r\nquite strong during easterly blows.\r\n\r\nThe principal fishing upon this bank in the past has been for cod and\r\nhaddock: and while former reports, (1881) speak of this as having once\r\nbeen a favorite fishing ground for halibut and state that it was not at\r\ntime of much importance in that fishery, the figures for this ground for\r\nthe year 1923 show the halibut catch to have been third in volume and\r\nfirst in value of the species taken there. In fact, the catch of halibut\r\nhere makes quite an imposing figure when the comparatively small size of\r\nthe ground is considered.\r\n\r\nLittle La Have and the La Have Ridges are simply continuations of this\r\nback toward the Western Bank for a distance of about 45 miles. This\r\nplaces the eastern limit in about 62° 50' west longitude, the northern\r\nand southern boundaries being about as those of La Have Bank. The area\r\nof the ridges is about 1,575 miles. The bottom here is a succession of\r\nridges of pebbles and gravel with occasional patches of rocks. Depths\r\nare from 53 to 80 fathoms. The current, occasionally strong, is weaker\r\nhere than farther W. on the bank and, except during easterly winds, is\r\nbut little noticed. The general set is westerly.\r\n\r\n\"The Ridges\" says the report before mentioned, \"were for a number of\r\nyears one of the favorite resorts for halibut catchers in winter, and\r\nmany good catches of cod were taken here at that season. At present but\r\nfew halibut are caught except in the deep water along the southern edge\r\nof the ground, where they sometimes have been found quite plentiful\r\nduring nearly the entire year.\" Apparently there has not been much\r\nchange in these conditions since the writer's time; fish seem to be\r\npresent here In about the same quantities as in former years.\r\n\r\nOne piece of bottom, having depths of 25 to 50 fathoms over red clay,\r\nlying approximately in 43° 08' to 43° 10' north latitude and about 81°\r\nto 83° west longitude, seems a good spring and early summer ground.\r\nApparently red-clay bottom indicates a good halibut ground, as this\r\nspecies is usually present where such a bottom is found.\r\n\r\nHake are found in good numbers in the deep water about the edges of the\r\nground and even on the Ridges.\r\n\r\nThese waters are quite heavily fished from Canadian ports, and a fair\r\nnumber of American vessels visit them each year, most of them hailing\r\nfrom Boston or Gloucester.\r\n\r\nScandinavian Bank. Eighteen miles SSW. from Shelbourne Light. Nova\r\nScotia. It is about 3 miles long in an E. and W. direction by about ½\r\nmile wide. In general, the bottom is level, with depths from 50 to 70\r\nfathoms; the shoal parts are sharp and rocky, the bottom over the deeper\r\nportions being composed mostly of small black and yellow pebbles.\r\n\r\nThis is a summer halibut ground (July and August) in depths from 45 to\r\n60 fathoms, and halibut occur in October in the deeper waters about it.\r\nIt is also a fair summer cod ground, and cusk are present in the deep\r\nwater about the edges during most of the year. In general, species and\r\nseasons are much as on Roseway.\r\n\r\nWestern Bank. This is one of the most important fishing grounds of the\r\nwestern Atlantic, whether as regards size or the abundance of its\r\nproduct. It lies S. of Cape Breton Island and the eastern part of Nova\r\nScotia between the parallels of 42° 55' and 44° 46' north latitude and\r\nthe meridians of 59°04' and 62° 35' west longitude. It has a length of\r\n156 miles and a width, including the Middle Ground, of 76 miles. It is\r\nabout 420 miles E. ½ S. from Boston to the southwestern edge, which\r\nmeans about 48 hours' steaming for the otter-trawl fleet.\r\n\r\nThe general contour of the bank within the 65-fathom line, as laid down\r\non the Admiralty chart, approaches somewhat a very elongated ellipse,\r\nthe longer axis running NE. by E. and SW. by W.; but over a broad area\r\nto eastward of the center of the bank, soundings of less than 50 fathoms\r\nconnect it directly with the Middle Ground, which we have here included\r\nin the some bank. The total extent of the bank thus defined is about\r\n7,000 square geographical miles. Off its eastern end lies Banquereau\r\n(the Quereau of the fishermen) with The Gully between, and a short\r\ndistance of the western edge are the La Have Ridges.\r\n\r\nThe depths off the southern edge of the bank increase rapidly from 80 to\r\n700, 1,200, and even 1,400 fathoms. At the eastern end is Sable Island,\r\n[16] \"graveyard of ships\", a long, narrow, crescent-shaped elevation\r\nseemingly lessening in area each year, formed entirely of sand that has\r\nbeen blown Into innumerable hummocks and dunes. Off both ends of the\r\nisland are long and dangerous sand bars. The length of the island is 20\r\nmiles; its greatest width is about 1½ miles. It is said that the\r\nNorthwest Light has been moved three times due to the fact that the\r\nwestern end of the island has been literally blown away. It lies in an\r\nE. and W. direction, and the depth of water over the bars for a distance\r\nof 7 to 10 miles out does not exceed 2 fathoms, and even 10 miles\r\nfarther out the depths do not exceed 10 to 11 fathoms. Within recent\r\nyears fishermen have reported the appearance of a sand shoal about 5 or\r\n6 miles SE. from the Northeast Light. This is said to appear at low\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nIn general, the bank slopes S. and W. from the island, depths ranging\r\nfrom 18 to 60 fathoms. The bottom is mostly sandy with patches of gravel\r\nand pebbles. Currents are sometimes very strong about Sable Island and\r\nare somewhat irregular; apparently they are much influenced by the\r\nwinds. On the other parts of the bank usually there is but little\r\ncurrent, whatever there is usually tending toward the west.\r\n\r\nFormerly the cod and halibut were the food fishes most taken here, but\r\nwith the changed methods in the fishery (as the growth of the\r\notter-trawl fleet) and a changed taste in our public the haddock catch\r\nhas become the second most important in the receipts of fish from these\r\nwaters. The halibut fishery stands third in the list. Other bottom\r\nfeeders occur in less numbers, the pollock and the cusk perhaps being\r\nnext in order of importance, with hake and a considerable amount of the\r\nvarious flatfishes in the otter trawls. These latter are marketed as\r\nsole.\r\n\r\nNoting the small amount of haddock in the fares taken from these waters\r\nin former years, the writer asked a number of old-time fishermen as to\r\nits abundance in the old days. The reply was usually \"Oh, yes, there\r\nwere always haddock there; sometimes they bothered us a lot.\" Then,\r\nnoting my surprise at so putting it, \"You know, the haddock isn't much\r\nas a salt fish.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that in 1923 the haddock catch here was a very good\r\nsecond to the cod catch in poundage, though not so valuable\r\nproportionately. In the otter-trawl catch from this ground it will be\r\nnoted that the positions of the two species are reversed. As a rule,\r\nthese steamers certainly take more than 2 pounds of haddock to 1 of cod\r\non other offshore grounds--perhaps the result of operating in the\r\nshoaler waters and on the smoother bottom because of the difficulty of\r\ndragging over the rocky and kelp-covered ground, which the cod seems to\r\nprefer. But the bottom on the Western Bank is of such nature as to offer\r\nlittle obstruction to the passage of the net, so that virtually all\r\nparts of it may be fished by this method; and this, added to the known\r\nmovements of the cod schools makes it possible at certain seasons of the\r\nyear to catch a larger proportion of this species if it is so desired.\r\n\r\nHaddock are found about the bars at both ends of the island in March and\r\nfrom that time to about June 1 in from 15 to 22 fathoms. They are also\r\nabundant 18 miles W. from the Northwest Light at the same seasons and\r\nat the same depths. During April, May, and June they come in close to\r\nthe island in from 10 to 17 fathoms--even to 1 fathom. Through the\r\nrest of the year (except for the colder months, when they have moved off\r\ninto deeper water) they may be found all over the bank on sandy bottom\r\nin 28 to 30 fathoms, where most of the beam trawl fishing is carried on.\r\n\r\nThere is a good cod school each year on the comparatively level bottom\r\nalong the western and southwestern edges of the ground in 70 fathoms and\r\nmore from February 1 to May 1, and in most years a certain amount of\r\nthis species is taken on this area. In May this school seems to have\r\nmoved on to a piece of bottom about 20 miles long lying SW. from the\r\nNorthwest Light and having depths averaging 27 fathoms. With fair\r\nfishing for cod on the Western Bank during most of the year, they seem\r\nto be most abundant from the first of March to June. The winter school\r\nhere appears to be smaller than that on Georges, but apparently this\r\nspecies visits this ground in considerable numbers during the spawning\r\nseason. In winter the cod are mainly found upon the western part of the\r\nbank, moving into the shoaler waters toward Sable Island as the spring\r\nadvances (during March and April), the \"Bend\" of the island and the\r\nneighborhood of the bars in 2 to 4 fathoms, where they can be seen\r\ntaking the hook or can be \"jigged.\" being favorite grounds. The ground\r\nlying W. from the Northwest Light, on and about the Northwest Bar (18\r\nmiles W, from the light), is a favorite cod ground in May and June. The\r\nshoal water over the rocky bottom WNW from the Northwest Light furnishes\r\ngood cod fishing from June 10 to July 1. This piece begins just outside\r\nthe 3-mile stretch of breakers running out from the land and extends\r\noffshore in a generally westerly direction to 24 fathoms. Much\r\nhand-lining is done here.\r\n\r\nIn the shoal water, in April and May, the fish seem to be feeding on the\r\n\"lant,\" (Ammodytes americanus). It is said that the fish taken on the\r\nbottom close to the island are smaller than those found farther west.\r\nThe shoal water of the northern shore of the island is said to have good\r\ncod grounds and favorite spots for \"dory hand-lining.\" The cod schools\r\nseem to arrive on the Northern Peak (SE. from the Northeast Light 40\r\nmiles to SE ½ S. from same point 28 miles) in late March and the first\r\nof April, moving N. and W. to the island. The cod of Sable Island are\r\nsaid to be fine, firm fish, perhaps due to the abundance of the \"red\r\nclams\" (bank clams) on these grounds.\r\n\r\nThe cod and haddock fishery is carried on by American and Canadian\r\nsailing vessels and otter trawlers, an increasing number of English and\r\nFrench vessels of the latter class engaging in the fishery of this\r\nground each year.\r\n\r\nHalibut are found on the Western Bank virtually all the year at depths\r\nvarying with the seasons. As a halibut bank, this, with The Gully and\r\nQuereau--in fact, all one piece of ground--ranks second only to the Grand\r\nBank Itself. The best fishing here for halibut is found from January to\r\nOctober. There are numerous places on and about the bank that the\r\nhalibut seems to prefer, as the Peak of Pike, 85 miles W. by S. from the\r\nNorthwest Light of Sable Island; S. and SW. of Sable Island from 12 to\r\n38 miles; SW. 20 miles in 60 fathoms in May; thence out into 100 and 150\r\nfathoms in June; in fact, following the 100--fathom curve along the\r\nedge of this bank, past the Northeast Peak (40 miles SE. from the\r\nNortheast Light), into the Gully and around the Southern Prong of\r\nQuereau to the Middle Prong. Apparently they leave this piece of bottom\r\nin July. Often the fish are close to the island in the spring, where the\r\nwater is so shoal that they can be seen taking the bait or playing with\r\nthe hook before taking. In April, May, and June a good halibut ground is\r\nin 18 fathoms 24 miles WNW. from Sable Island.\r\n\r\nThe Western Bank seems to be a good feeding ground for both cod and\r\nhalibut as it abounds in shellfish and crustaceans, and at certain\r\nperiods there are many smaller species of fish upon it, such as the lant\r\nand herring, on which these species and the haddock, also, especially\r\nprey. A considerable amount of swordfish is taken here in August and\r\nSeptember, mainly by American vessels.\r\n\r\nBanquereau. Separated from the Western Bank by The Gully, this has a\r\nvery irregular form--the main bank roughly rectangular, with a narrow\r\nwesterly extension of comparatively regular form. Its length, E. and W.,\r\nis about 120 miles, its greatest width about 47 miles, and its total\r\narea about 2,800 miles.\r\n\r\nThe main portion of the bank lies between 44° 04' and 45° 01' north\r\nlatitude and 67° 10' and 59° 00' west longitude, and the western\r\nprolongation lies between 44° 24' and 44° 42' north latitude and 69° 00'\r\nand 80° 05' west longitude. North of Banquereau lies Artimon, distant\r\n3 miles, and Misaine, distant from 2 to 15 miles according to the places\r\nfrom which measurements are taken. The currents here are of varying\r\nforce, much influenced by the wind, so that several days of strong tides\r\nmay be followed by intervals when there is little if any current.\r\n\r\nOn the eastern part of Quereau is an area of shoal ground called the\r\nRocky Bottom, having a depth of about 18 fathoms; elsewhere depths run\r\nfrom 18 to 50 fathoms. For the most part the bottom is rocky, but there\r\nare scattered patches of sand and gravel.\r\n\r\nCod and halibut are the principal food fishes taken, hake, haddock, and\r\ncusk being taken in small numbers. The Rocky Bottom, a shoal ground of\r\n20 to 25 fathom depths on the eastern part, was much resorted to by dory\r\nhandliners in summer. The cod are most plentiful on the eastern part of\r\nthe bank, though occasional good fares are taken toward the west. The\r\nbest cod fishing on this bank is from May until September, when the\r\nschools gather to feed upon the lant, squid, crustaceans, and shellfish,\r\nthen very abundant.\r\n\r\nHalibut are found here all the year off the edges in 100 to 400 fathoms.\r\nApparently these are feeding and breeding grounds for this species, and\r\nit is not unusual for a school to remain for weeks and even months in\r\none locality, though some of these may be fish in migration northward.\r\n\r\nThe principal halibut grounds are along the southern and eastern borders\r\nof the bank--the Southwest Prong and the Southwest Cove (in about 44°\r\nN. lat. and between 58° 30' and 58° 55' W. long), the Middle Prong (44°\r\n14' N. lat. and 58° W. long.), and the Eastern Slope (44° 28' to 45° 00'\r\nN. lat.)--in depths of 150 to 400 fathoms. These deep-water areas are\r\nrocky and support a very rich growth of gorgonians, corals, sea\r\nanemones, etc. The Eastern Slope has an abundance of bank clams in\r\ndepths of 25 fathoms. These beds are good hand-line grounds for cod. The\r\nhalibut, too, feeds to a considerable extent upon these red clams.\r\n\r\nThe Stone Fence off the eastern slope of Quereau is a very rocky piece\r\nof ground full of \"trees\" (corals) in 250 fathoms. This is a good\r\nhalibut ground although it is almost impossible to haul the gear by hand\r\nand the use of the \"gurdy\" (a roller turned by a crank and fastened to\r\nthe dory's bow for winding up the trawl) becomes necessary. Occasional\r\nfares of halibut are taken on and about the Rocky Bottom in 20 to 25\r\nfathoms from July 1 to August 1.\r\n\r\nThe Gully. This is the deep waterway between Banquereau and Sable\r\nIsland or Western Bank. It extends in an WNW. and an ESE. direction\r\nnorth of Sable Island, turning somewhat abruptly S. at its eastern end\r\nand continuing down between the eastern end of Western Bank and the\r\nSouthwest Prong of Banquereau. The entire length is about 80 miles, the\r\ngreatest width about 20 miles. Depths range from 68 to 145 fathoms over\r\na bottom of rocks, gravel, sand, and mud. The rocky and gravelly\r\nportions form several ridges separated by areas of finer materials,\r\nexcept in the eastern section, where the intervals between are mostly\r\ncovered by pebbles and sharp rocks. Ocean currents are generally\r\nwesterly, of varying strength, much affected by the easterly winds.\r\n\r\nThe Gully is a very important halibut ground. The halibut are not found\r\nin great numbers all over the ground, perhaps the best of the fishing\r\nbeing on the rocky and gravelly ridges and slopes included between the\r\nmeridians of 69° and 80° west longitude. This rocky bottom is rich in\r\nfood, and the lant and herring are usually plentiful here in their\r\nseason. In the spring the halibut seem to be especially numerous in the\r\nnorthern and northwestern parts of the bank, later, in June and July,\r\nmoving farther out. Some, are found here in winter. While the cod is\r\nsometimes found in The Gully in 60 to 90 fathoms, it does not seem to be\r\nof regular occurrence; and apparently there are almost no haddock here,\r\nprobably because of the depth of the water and the nature of the bottom.\r\n\r\nArtimon Bank. Has an area of some 120 square miles with a bottom of\r\ngravel and rocks and depths of 38 to 50 fathoms. It is but little known\r\nbecause of the tendency of the fishermen to use the larger grounds close\r\nat hand. Cod are known to be present here, however. The bank lies N. of\r\nthe eastern part of Quereau, separated from it by a narrow, deep-water\r\nchannel.\r\n\r\nMisaine Bank. Lies N. of the western two-thirds of Quereau, at one\r\nplace very near, but in general the banks are separated by some 20 miles\r\nof deep water. Its greatest length is 80 miles and its greatest width 40\r\nmiles. Depths are from 40 to 60 fathoms over a bottom broken and rocky.\r\nIt is not of much importance as a fishing ground, although a few halibut\r\ntrips are landed from it in most years.\r\n\r\nCanso Bank. A long, narrow extension of Misaine Bank, lying in an E,\r\nand W. direction; its length is 45 miles and its greatest width 13\r\nmiles, its area being about 425 square miles. Depths range from 30 to 65\r\nfathoms over a bottom of sand, with spots of gravel and pebbles. It is\r\nnot of much importance as a fishing ground, especially as judged by the\r\nuse of it by the American fleet, though more fished by vessels from Nova\r\nScotia; perhaps it is overshadowed by the presence of its larger\r\nneighbors, Western and Quereau Banks, with which grounds it forms\r\nvirtually one piece of bottom, only narrow, deep-water channels\r\nseparating them. These larger grounds are heavily fished both by\r\nAmerican vessels and by those from Nova Scotia ports as well as by\r\nFrench and English otter trawlers.\r\n\r\nThe statistics given here and elsewhere in this report are taken from\r\nthe published bulletins of the United States Bureau of Fisheries, and\r\ninclude only the landings of vessels of 5 tons net, or over, at the\r\nports of Boston and Glouscester, Mass., and Portland, Me.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Table 5--Fishing grounds of the offshore North Atlantic, showing\r\nthe principal species taken upon them]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: \"Pedro Reinel, a Portuguese pilot of much fame\" (Herrera)\r\nmade a map in 1505 showing Sable Island, feared and dreaded by all\r\nfishermen even in those days, where he called it \"Santa Cruz.\" Jacamo\r\nGastaldi, an Italian cartographer, in 1548 shows it \"Isolla de Arena.\"\r\nSir Humphrey Gilbert or his historian, says that the Portuguese had\r\nmade an interesting settlement here for shipwrecked mariners. This,\r\n\"Upon intelligence we had of a Portugal who was himself present when\r\nthe Portugals, above thirty years past (thus before 1551) did put upon\r\nthe island neat and swine to breed, which were since exceedingly\r\nmultiplied.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLES OF CATCH\r\n\r\n\r\n[Table 6--Distance from Boston or Gloucester, Mass., to the center\r\nof certain of the more important offshore banks]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Table 7--Distance from Portland, Me., to the center of certain of the\r\nmore important offshore banks]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Table 8--Landings by fishing vessels at Boston and Gloucester, Mass.,\r\nand Portland, Me., from inner or shore grounds, 1927]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Table 9--Landings by fishing vessels at Boston and Gloucester, Mass.,\r\nand Portland, Me., from the outer grounds of the Gulf of Maine, 1927]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Table 10--Landings by fishing vessels at Boston and Gloucester, Mass.,\r\nand Portland, Me., from the fishing grounds of the Georges Bank area,\r\n1927]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Table 11--Landings by the otter-trawl fleet at Boston and Gloucester,\r\nMass., and Portland, Me., from the fishing grounds of the Georges Bank\r\narea, 1927]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Table 12--Landings by fishing vessels at Boston and Gloucester, Mass.,\r\nand Portland, Me., from the offshore grounds adjacent to the Gulf of\r\nMaine, 1927]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Table 13--Landings by fishing vessels at Boston and Gloucester, Mass.,\r\nand Portland, Me., from all grounds, 1927]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Table 14--Landings by fishing vessels from the various fishing grounds\r\nat Boston and Gloucester, Mass., and Portland, Me., 1927]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Table 15--Landings by fishing vessels from all grounds at Boston and\r\nGloucester, Mass., and Portland, Me., 1916 to 1927]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAPS\r\n\r\n\r\n[Map--Coastal Banks and Inshore Grounds of the Gulf of Maine: Bay of\r\nFundy]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Map--Coastal Banks and Inshore Grounds of the Gulf of Maine: Monhegan\r\nto Petit Manan]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Map--Coastal Banks and Inshore Grounds of the Gulf of Maine: Monhegan\r\nto Cape Cod]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Map--Coastal Banks and Inshore Grounds of the Gulf of Maine: Petit\r\nManan to Seal Island]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Map--Fishing Grounds of the Gulf of Maine: The Georges Area]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX TO GROUNDS\r\n\r\nAbner Ground\r\nAcre, The\r\nAllens Shoal\r\nAndrews Shoal\r\nApron The\r\nArtimon Bank\r\n\r\nBaker's Island Ridge\r\nBald Ridges\r\nBank Comfort\r\nBanks Ground\r\nBanquereau\r\nBantam\r\nBarley Hill Ground\r\nBarnum Head Ground\r\nBay of Fundy\r\nBeaver Harbor\r\nBen's Ground\r\nBig Ridge Doggetts\r\nBig Ridge (Cashes)\r\nBlack Island Ground\r\nBlack Ledges Ground\r\nBlue Clay\r\nBlue Ground\r\nBlue Hill Ground\r\nBoar Head Ground\r\nBoon Island Rock Ground\r\nBounties, The\r\nBoutens, Inner and Outer\r\nBrewers Spot\r\nBroken Ground\r\nBroken Ground\r\nBroken Ridges\r\nBrowns Bank\r\nBulkhead Rips\r\nBumbo, Outer and Inner\r\nBurnt Island Inner Ridge\r\nBurnt Island Outer Ridge\r\nBull Ground\r\n\r\nCampobello\r\nCanso\r\nCape Porpoise Peaks\r\nCards Reef\r\nCashes Bank\r\nCashes Ridge, East\r\nCashes NW Ridge\r\nCashes Big Ridge\r\nChannel\r\nClarks Ground\r\nClay Bank\r\nClay Ridge\r\nCoast Nova Scotia\r\nCod Ledges\r\nCod Ridge\r\nCove (S.E.
