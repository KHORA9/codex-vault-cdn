WALKER, of Albany, N. Y. The\r\nfacts stated are but a small portion of the large amount of material\r\nin her possession. The compiler has endeavored to give due credit to\r\nall by name whose statements are given, so that none may suppose he has\r\neither drawn upon the resources of his imagination or appropriated the\r\nideas and language of others as his own.\r\n\r\n                                            HENRY E. PERRINE.\r\n  _June_, 1876.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn our northern States there are thousands of health and pleasure\r\nseekers who every fall eagerly hasten away from comfortable and\r\nluxurious homes to escape the rigors of approaching winter. Of late\r\nyears the current of travel has been constantly increasing, being\r\ndirected more and more toward that portion of our country which, beyond\r\ndispute, can now claim to be more healthful and free from disease\r\nthan any other section of the Union. The statistics furnished by the\r\nSurgeon-General of the United States establish this fact. He says:\r\n“The diseases which result from malaria are of a much milder type\r\nin the Peninsula of Florida than in any other State in the Union.\r\nThese records show that the rates of deaths to the number of cases of\r\nremittent fever has been much less than among the troops serving in\r\nany other portions of the United States. In the middle division of the\r\nUnited States, the proportion is one death to thirty-six cases; in\r\nthe northern, one to fifty-two; in the southern, one to fifty-four;\r\nin Texas, one to seventy-eight; in California, one to one hundred and\r\ntwenty-two; in New Mexico, one to one hundred and forty-eight; while\r\nin Florida, it is but _one to two hundred and eighty-seven_.” More\r\nwill be said upon this subject further on. The facts compiled in this\r\nlittle pamphlet with great care, are not intended alone for the benefit\r\nof the invalid and mere seeker of pleasure. They are to attract the\r\nattention of the large number of people who for many years have been\r\nstruggling in the various avenues of business, in our cities and large\r\ntowns, men whose earnings, even if large in the aggregate, have been\r\neach year swallowed up by the increased cost of living in these later\r\ndays. For those who would like a home in a more genial clime, where\r\nthey can, by patient industry, within from two to six years, lay the\r\nsure foundation for a permanent income, where the expenses of living\r\nare not more than about one-fourth as great as in the north, these\r\npages will surely be of interest and will repay them for the time\r\nconsumed in their perusal. The peninsula of Florida extends abruptly\r\nfrom the main land of the continent, in a direction a little east of\r\nsouth. It is nearly 400 miles in length, and has an average width of\r\n130 miles. Its formation is peculiar. Every other peninsula in the\r\nworld owes its existence to a central mountain chain, which affords a\r\nstubborn resistance to the waves. Florida has no such elevations, and\r\nmainly a loose, low, sandy soil. It has another peculiarity. It is\r\nsaid, that at no other point in the world do the trade winds divide,\r\nas at Cape Sable. On the one hand, passing up the east coast to the\r\nAtlantic, and on the west into the Gulf of Mexico. This it is that\r\nproduces that wonderful equability of climate, that puzzles a northern\r\nman to understand, why it should be so much cooler in summer than at\r\nthe north. The base of all southern Florida is limestone, not tertiary,\r\nbut modern and coralline. This it is that prevents all miasma, and\r\nthis decomposed limestone with its admixture of vegetable mold, makes\r\nthe best soil in the United States for the introduction of tropical\r\nplants. This it is, also, that causes the difference in fertility of\r\nthis soil, as compared with the siliceous sand of the more northern\r\npart of the State. Biscayne Bay is located on the south-eastern coast\r\nof Florida, between the twenty-fifth and twenty-sixth degrees of north\r\nlatitude, below the frost line, and is included within the limits of\r\nDade county. The following facts are quoted from the “Florida Settler\r\nand Immigrants’ Guide,” prepared by Dennis Eagan, Commissioner of Lands\r\nand Immigration: “The climate of Dade county is exceedingly agreeable\r\nand conducive to health. The thermometer throughout the year shows a\r\ntemperature of about seventy-five degrees, the extremes being fifty-one\r\nand ninety-two degrees. It is never visited by frost, and the heat in\r\nmidsummer is much less oppressive than at New York or places further\r\nnorth, being tempered by the influence of the Gulf Stream, which flows\r\nwithin a few miles of the coast. The water is pure and good. Many\r\nfine springs are found in different parts of the country; some of\r\nthem mineral springs of considerable value. The everglades, which are\r\nwithin the limits of Dade county, simply consist of a shallow lake of\r\nvast extent--the water is from six inches to six feet in depth, and\r\nteems with aquatic and semiaquatic plants, which present to the eyes\r\nof the beholder a scene of perpetual verdure. Out of the surface of\r\nthe lake rise innumerable small islands, which are covered over with a\r\ngrowth of cypress, sweet bay, crabwood, mastic, cocoa palms, cabbage\r\npalmetto, and live and water oaks. The waters abound in turtles, fish,\r\netc. Around the margin of the everglades is a prairie, from half a\r\nmile to a mile in breadth; * * * this prairie comprises some of the\r\nrichest land to be found in the United States, and has a productive\r\ncapacity for every variety of vegetable life known in the tropics\r\nthat is unsurpassed. * * * * Between the margin of the everglades and\r\nBiscayne Bay and Barnes Sound, there is a strip of land from three to\r\nfifteen miles in breadth. It is for the most part rocky pine land,\r\nand some portions have a considerable elevation above the level of\r\nthe ocean. The deposits are oolitic and crystalline calcareous rock.\r\nIn the vicinity of the bay the land is covered with an undergrowth of\r\nsago palm, called the coontie, probably from the Indian designation of\r\nthe root. It yields an excellent article of starch, and also farina,\r\nwhich cannot be distinguished from Bermuda arrow root, except by the\r\naid of the microscope. The soil is well adapted for the cultivation\r\nof sea island cotton, which is here perennial, and can be picked at\r\nalmost all seasons of the year. Along the bay tobacco, equal to the\r\nbest grown in Cuba, can be cultivated” (yielding from five to seven\r\ncuttings each year), “while every variety of tropical fruit can be\r\ngrown successfully. The banana, plaintain, cocoanut, guava, sapadilla,\r\npomegranate, mamma, tamarind, pine-apple, lime, lemon, and citron.\r\nLimes are so abundant in some places that they literally cover the\r\nground. Grapes ripen in May. The finest varieties of fig are found in\r\ngreat abundance. The olive tree yields an oil equal to the best of\r\nLucca. The castor oil plant is also very productive, and the Sisal hemp\r\nof commerce, from which the best of cordage is made, is wonderfully\r\nabundant. Sugar cane grows to a great height, and ratoons from seven\r\nto ten years. The tomato gets to be a stout bush, with hard, woody\r\nstalk, and bears continually. Biscayne Bay abounds with a great variety\r\nof fish, and is also the favorite haunt of the green turtle; it here\r\nfinds an abundance of the peculiar seaweed it prefers and on which it\r\nthrives and fattens, and the water swarms with them. Key West offers\r\na market for all that can be caught, and turtle catching, in this\r\nsection, is a most lucrative employment. Sponges are very abundant,\r\nand a large trade is now carried on in Key West in this article. The\r\nsponges taken from these waters probably realize for the gatherers\r\nfifty to seventy-five thousand dollars per annum.” Northern persons, in\r\ngoing to this section, must leave behind them all their preconceived\r\nideas as to soil, for they will find that the above-mentioned rocky\r\npine lands are “_the very best_” for the cultivation of most of the\r\ntropical fruits, but the prairie lands, to use the language of Col. M.\r\nA. WILLIAMS (the State agent for the survey and location of the lands\r\ngranted to the State by the general government), “are inconceivably\r\nrich, beyond description,” and are well adapted to the growth of the\r\nmost exhausting crops of sugar cane and tobacco. L. D. STICKNEY,\r\nsays in his pamphlet on Florida, “It is a great mistake to suppose\r\nthat sugar cannot be made to advantage without the investment of\r\nlarge capital. The cane produced on less than ten acres of ground, is\r\nusually ground in a wooden mill, which does not cost more than $100\r\n(generally the work of the farmer himself), while the juice is boiled\r\nin the common utensils of the kitchen, or at best, as the New England\r\nfarmer manufactures his maple sugar. The yield is usually greater,\r\nin proportion to the stock worked, than where the machinery has cost\r\nten or fifteen thousand dollars! Cane is cultivated with more ease\r\nthan corn, not requiring so much hoeing. From midsummer to the time\r\nof harvesting, the hands may be employed in other business; and even\r\nat the time of taking off the crop, no great increase of hands is\r\nrequired, as in Louisiana or Texas, where frost prevails. One hand can\r\ncultivate six acres with the hoe, or ten to twelve with the aid of a\r\nhorse and plough. At the same time he can raise other crops sufficient\r\nto subsist himself and family. Twelve hundred pounds of sugar to the\r\nacre, is an average yield, though four thousand pounds have been\r\nproduced. (This refers to the yield on land further north than Biscayne\r\nBay; it is very certain that the larger yield can be relied upon in\r\nthis locality.) “The molasses is always expected to pay the expense of\r\nmanufacturing.” Col. M. A. WILLIAMS, while engaged in the United States\r\nsurvey in 1874, writes: “This country is attracting attention; those\r\nwho are here (and there are several from various States, who have come\r\nsince January), are perfectly delighted.” WM. M. SWAN, who was with\r\nhim, writes, “Biscayne Bay comes up to the preconceived idea general\r\nwith strangers in Florida. If this place (I mean the entire Bay), had\r\na competent party to write it up _as it is_, into notice, the larger\r\npart of the travel and investment would _undoubtedly center here_.”\r\n“The whole of Biscayne Bay, is far more beautiful than the scenery\r\nalong the Indian river and the St. Johns.” * * * * * “We met here a Mr.\r\nSAMUEL ROGERS, of Omaha, seeking health, and a desirable tropical home\r\nfor his family. After carefully plodding over the beaten track, the St.\r\nJohns and Indian river, he finally selected this as the Eldorado he had\r\nbeen seeking. Mr. ROGERS is one of the founders of the new thriving\r\ncity of Omaha.” Under date of May 30th, he writes: “The nights are\r\nalways pleasant, calling for a blanket before morning. I must admit,\r\nthat with the exception of Key Largo, I have not found mosquitoes any\r\nthing as bad on the whole, as I was led to believe.” * * * * * A Mr.\r\nJONES, of New York, reported to be very wealthy, says, “he has traveled\r\nover the continent of Europe two or three times; has visited all of\r\nthe Islands of the Mediterranean in search of a climate favorable to\r\nhis (heart) disease. He decides unequivocally in favor of the Bay, and\r\nannounces his intention to buy a small tract of land, put up a splendid\r\ncottage, stock an orchard complete in every fruit suitable, have his\r\nsteam yacht on hand for his convenience to travel anywhere; but his\r\n_home_ must be _here_. The climate he says, is far more agreeable and\r\ndelightful the year round than any he has found.” He has been boarding\r\nwith Mr. ADDISON for one or two seasons. We see plenty of deer, and\r\none of our party on Sunday killed one and wounded another. Mr. NOYES\r\nbrought in a live fawn and saw ten yesterday, although too shy to get\r\na shot. Partridges are numerous. I wish I could have time to write\r\nfully on the fruits that could be grown here. Bananas, plantains,\r\netc., the year around. The Rev. D. W. W. HICKS, of Miami, Biscayne\r\nBay, Dade county, in a speech, made before the Florida Fruit Growers\r\nAssociation, said: “Mr. President and gentlemen--I place myself below\r\n‘the frost line’ and within a territory, the most beautiful by nature,\r\nand the most susceptible to the attentions of industrial art, probably,\r\non the continent. It may not compare in rugged grandeur with the far\r\nWest, up the canyons of the Yellowstone, or within the picturesque\r\nvalleys of the Rocky mountains; but more beautiful, because with us,\r\nnature is in repose and at rest, holding in her lap the riches of a\r\nsemitropical clime, adorned with the perpetual bloom of Spring, and\r\nregaled with the unceasing concerts of the oriole and mocking bird. *\r\n* * * * * Who can do justice to that climate? The sick are restored to\r\nhealth, the poor may speedily become rich by industry. * * * * While\r\nborne upon every breeze is the balmy health giving breath of the Gulf\r\nStream.” BYRON in one of his rhapsodies, speaks of being “intoxicated\r\nwith eternity.” The sentiment seems vague and almost unnatural, but\r\nwhoever casts himself into the eddying blessings of the climate of\r\nwhich I speak, will, if he have a spark of sentiment, forgive the\r\npoet’s license. The rheumatic and the consumptive, with ordinary care,\r\nlose their ailments with us. Eighteen months ago, one came from the\r\nhyperborean regions of the North, lame and almost despairing. He was\r\naccompanied with crutches. A few months enabled him to throw them\r\naside, and to-day you would rejoice to take a tramp with him through\r\nthe Coontie forest, or better still a sail in his boat upon the bosom\r\nof the Bay of Biscayne. He is well. Rheumatism and my friend have\r\nparted company, and his crutches are the relics of a past age. The\r\nclimate suits the consumptive, because rude, abrupt changes in the\r\natmosphere are _almost unknown_. The Gulf Stream hugs our shores so\r\ndevotedly that from the North, Northeast, East, Southeast and South,\r\nno chill can obtrude upon us. The strongest breeze is tempered with a\r\nwarm and genial spirit. It is impossible to conceive of a more perfect\r\nclimate, taking it all in all. Of course we have plenty of sunshine,\r\nand hot sunshine too; but with the sunshine comes the breeze, and not\r\na day in the whole year need be lost on account of the heat. * * * *\r\n* * If the soil is thin, for the most part it is very rich and yields\r\nabundantly. The rock is near the surface when it does not protrude and\r\nis soft, nutritious to plants, and otherwise valuable and useful. “What\r\nwill grow there?” Every thing that I see about me in this hall except\r\ndiscontent! (The platform on which the gentleman stood was covered with\r\nvarious fruits: oranges, lemons, limes, citrons, bananas, and many\r\nvarieties of vegetables.) This looks like home. I see familiar things,\r\nbut _miss_ more than I recognize! I think I must yield the palm to you\r\nin oranges, but in all other varieties of _citrus_, you must take a\r\nback seat. Our guava is a royal heritage, only we have not yet found\r\nhow to market them. We have about twenty varieties and thousands upon\r\nthousands of bearing trees. The fruit delicious to a cultivated taste\r\nfresh from the tree, while every housewife in the land, and every lover\r\nof sweets, can descant with eloquence upon the marmalades and jellies\r\nmade of this desirable fruit. The tree is hardy with us, and will take\r\ncare of and propagate itself, and is on terms of great cordiality\r\nwith our rocky plantations. It should bear in three years. Ours is the\r\nnatural country of the lime, lemon and citron; children of a common\r\nstock. We have several varieties of the lime. The trees are of rapid\r\ngrowth, constant bearers, very prolific, subject to no disease, and\r\nvery tenacious of life. The fruit is large, “How large?” as a Sicily\r\nlemon. I consider the lime as profitable as the orange, and more so,\r\nwith us. It should be cultivated for _citric acid_, of which it yields\r\nmore than any other fruit. The time will come when our part of Florida\r\nwill supply citric acid to the world. A peck of limes will yield a\r\ngallon of juice; one and a half gallons of juice should produce one\r\npound of citric acid, which in the markets of the world should bring\r\n$1.25 in gold. * * * Lime trees will bear in three years and can be\r\nplanted as thick as blackberry bushes, but to cultivate them, they\r\nshould be eight to ten feet apart. Too much attention can not be given\r\nto this matter. Citric acid is a commodity always, everywhere, and\r\nincreasingly in demand. The lime belt is narrow and limited. Ours is\r\nthe most productive in the world. The limes are larger than those of\r\nany other country and the percentage of acid is perceptibly greater.\r\nFortunes await in this department of industry alone, and the outlay\r\nof money to get a start is insignificant compared to the planting of\r\nan orange grove. Ours is the country of the palm and the cocoanut.\r\nThe tree grows with us enormously and bears continuously. They are\r\nmeat and drink in a thirsty land. Then we have the _mango_ and _maumee\r\napple_, fruits one soon becomes familiar with, after which, intimacy\r\nis never interrupted. But the _sugar apple_ is, from my point of view\r\nand experience, the choicest of all. There is nothing comparable to\r\nit. “Exquisite” is a nice word, and orange, mango, maumee, avocado\r\npear, pine-apple, banana, are names, the bare mention of which sets\r\none’s mouth watering, but gentlemen, they are all, compared with the\r\nsugar apple, common things! I can give you no adequate idea of it,\r\nand I will not attempt to put my experience of its lusciousness into\r\nmere English, for after all is said that may be said, the apple itself\r\nmust be seen, handled (very tenderly) and _eaten_ when, gentlemen, you\r\n_must_ come down to Dade to eat the proof of my words. (Some one in\r\nthe audience; can’t you send us a few?) No; for two or three reasons.\r\nFirst, to pull a sugar apple is to eat it. Second, some one would\r\nbe sure to capture it on the way. Third, it must be eaten where it\r\ngrows. (SOLON ROBINSON--How does it taste?) Ah! my friend, ask the\r\nlover how the pure kiss of affection tastes, and he will describe it\r\naccurately. The fruit immortalizes our country, and a true description\r\nof its deliciousness, its creamy, frosted sweetness, its fragrance\r\nbeneath the dimpled protecting ring will immortalize its author. Of the\r\nalligator pear, I need not speak at large. They are brought in large\r\nquantities to Key West from Cuba every year, and readily sell at from\r\nforty to seventy-five cents per dozen. They grow well with us. The\r\nfruit is large, and love of it is acquired; but once truly relished,\r\nbread is at a discount. Ours is the banana’s own country, and shortly\r\nthis delicious and valuable fruit will receive a large share of our\r\nattention. The _pine-apple_ belongs to us; nothing grows better. It is\r\npeculiarly adapted to our rock soil, and will thrive and bear fruit if\r\na hole is made in the soft rock for its accommodation. Our soft rock\r\nis admirably adapted for building purposes. It is easily worked but\r\nsoon hardens when exposed to the sun and air, and then coheres like\r\npublic plunder! When burned it is first-rate for lime and mortar, and\r\nalso as a fertilizer.” Mr. HICKS in answer to the question, whether\r\nhe would advise emigration, said, “yes; but I would advertise to all,\r\nthat it is no country for a lazy man without means. A man with money\r\nto keep him in necessaries for a couple of years could get a paying\r\nstart and so go on to fortune. Industry pays quite as well there as in\r\nany part of the globe.” R. M. BACHE, of Philadelphia, author of “The\r\nYoung Wrecker of the Florida Reef,” writes: “The climate of Biscayne\r\nBay, like that of all the Reef, is wonderfully equable and pleasant,\r\ninsular in its character, _rarely_ oppressively hot in the shade,\r\nand during most of the year leaving nothing to be desired regarding\r\nenjoyability, the only trying weather being an occasional “norther.”\r\nFish as well as turtle, are abundant, and game of various kinds on\r\nthe land. The impressions I have about the soil, is that it is _very_\r\nfertile; I do not see how, from its formation, it could be otherwise.”\r\nCapt. GIBBS of Buffalo, N. Y., writes from Biscayne Bay, under dates\r\nof March 14th and April 7th, and 25th, 1876 (to his wife and Mr. J.\r\nP. TRIBLE): “I am in love with this country; the climate is simply\r\neverything that is beautiful, it is all and more than all that has been\r\nsaid of it. There has never been a case of ague that I can hear of. I\r\ndo not wish to come back, and shall not if you will come down here. I\r\nhave not had an ache, pain, cough or sneeze, since I have been here.”\r\n(He left Buffalo with a bad cough.) “Two men can raise more stuff,\r\noff from ten acres of land here, than four times the number can from\r\na hundred acres in the North. With irrigation in the winter season,\r\nthere is no end to the growth of everything. Squashes (they call them\r\npumpkins here) once planted, grow forever. Sweet potatoes the same,\r\nand many other things.” * * * * * There is a man from Orange county,\r\nwho says the pine land here is better than in Orange county, and he is\r\ncoming down to settle, this side of New River, so as to get below the\r\nfrost line. * * * Bermuda grass grows luxuriantly. I have seen it on\r\nboth pine and hammock lands. You can have green peas, new potatoes,\r\ncabbage, onions, etc., every month in the year, they had them at\r\nChristmas and New Years.” Capt. GIBBS proposes to plant on the place\r\nhe has purchased on the Bay, ten thousand cocoanut trees, which are\r\nexpected to bear in six years, and will require no care whatever, save\r\nto be fenced in for protection from stock while growing. One hundred\r\nnuts to the tree (which is only one fourth what may be expected when\r\nin full bearing) would give a pretty fair income, at the lowest price\r\n$15.00 per thousand, paid on the ground by buyers. DANIEL G. BRINTON,\r\nA. M., M. D., in his book for tourists, and invalids, (“Florida and the\r\nSouth”), says of Biscayne Bay: “Undoubtedly the finest winter climate\r\nin the United States, both in point of temperature and health, is to\r\nbe found on the Southeastern coast of Florida. It is earnestly to be\r\nhoped, for the sake of invalids, that accommodations along the shore\r\nat Key Biscayne, and at the mouth of the Miami, will before long be\r\nprovided. While it is the _very best_, it could also be made the _most\r\naccessible_ part of the sea coast of Florida, as the whole journey from\r\nthe North could be made by water. Game as deer, bear, turkeys, etc.,\r\netc., very abundant in the pine woods, which extend along the coast,\r\nand fish swarm in countless numbers in the bay. Turtle of the finest\r\nkinds can be caught on the islets off the shore. Oysters are plentiful.\r\nThe abundance of game on the shore ridge from Cape Sable to Miami, led\r\nit to be chosen as a favorite spot of resort by the Indians, and it\r\nis still distinctively known as the ‘Hunting Grounds.’” Dr. BRINTON\r\ncontinues on page one hundred and twenty-eight of his book, “and\r\nthese are the words of Dr. R. F. SIMPSON, U. S. A., writing about Fort\r\nDallas, on the Miami. The very spot I have been maintaining approaches\r\nthe nearest, the model climate for consumptives; I have been on duty\r\nat most of the posts in Florida, but _none compare_ with this for\r\nsalubrity. The sea coast of south east Florida, therefore fulfills the\r\nfour conditions which make up the best climate for a consumptive. I\r\nhave other testimony about it, well worth presenting. It, too, comes\r\nfrom the same unimpeachable source, the medical statistics of the\r\nUnited States Army. We are inquiring particularly about throat and\r\nlung complaints. These army statistics are here of immense importance.\r\nThey specify the diseases of each station. I have taken these four.\r\nConsumption (phthisis pulmonalis), bronchitis, inflammation of the\r\nlungs (pneumonia) and pleurisy; and have ascertained their relative\r\nfrequency at various points in the South. Here are the results,\r\nomitting fractions. In Arkansas, each year, one man in every sixteen\r\ncame under the surgeons hands, with one or the other of these diseases;\r\non the southern frontier of Texas, also one in sixteen; at Baton\r\nRouge, La., one in seventeen; on the western frontier in Texas, one in\r\nnineteen; on the _west_ coast of Florida, one in twenty-one; on the\r\n_east_ coast of Florida, one in _thirty-nine_. This is confirmation\r\nstrong indeed. Even in the favored northwest we may look in vain for\r\nany thing equal to it. The sick reports of St. Paul, Minn., show one in\r\nevery nineteen, yearly treated for these complaints. * * * * * All that\r\nis needed to make it one of the most eligible spots in the South for\r\nthe invalid or the tourist, are a few well-kept, moderate priced hotels\r\nand weekly steamers. * * * * I have already detailed at some length the\r\nposition, soil, etc., of Biscayne Bay, but as already said, I build for\r\nthe future, and not the present. _It has the best warm climate in the\r\nUnited States for invalids and it deserves to become a much frequented\r\nresort._” The reader will bear in mind that Biscayne Bay is between the\r\nsame degrees of latitude as that of the Island of New Providence, on\r\nwhich Nassau is situated.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PERRINE GRANT--BISCAYNE BAY.\r\n\r\nThe facts embraced in the preceding pages, apply to various portions of\r\nBiscayne Bay. Before condensing the reports of Col. WILLIAMS and Mr.\r\nWM. M. SWAN, in regard to their survey of the land in 1874, it may be\r\nwell to explain to the reader the history of the “Perrine grant.” Dr.\r\nHENRY PERRINE, while United States Consul, at Campeche, in Yucatan, in\r\n1827, received a circular from RICHARD RUSH, Secretary of State, under\r\nJOHN QUINCY ADAMS, commencing as follows: “The President of United\r\nStates is desirous of causing to be introduced into the United States,\r\nall such trees and plants from other countries, not heretofore known\r\nin the United States, as may give promise under proper cultivation, of\r\nflourishing and becoming useful, as well as superior varieties of such\r\nas are already cultivated here. To this end I have his instructions\r\nto address myself to you, invoking your aid to give effect to the\r\nplan he has in view, etc., etc.” In obedience to that circular, Dr.\r\nPERRINE devoted nine years of his life to collecting and transmitting\r\nto the United States, the valuable plants and seeds of the tropics, a\r\nlist and description of which will be found in the printed reports of\r\nCongress in 1838. Upon his return to this country Congress granted to\r\nhim a township of land to be located in Florida, below the twenty-sixth\r\ndegree of north latitude. In 1840, while engaged in the cultivation\r\nand domesticating these plants upon the islands of Indian Key and\r\nMatacumba, preparatory to their removal to the township after the\r\nSeminole war should cease, an attack was made upon Indian Key by the\r\nIndians, in overwhelming force. Dr. PERRINE with others was killed, his\r\nfamily, after a concealment of nine hours in the water under a wharf,\r\nduring which time their house was plundered and burned within a few\r\nfeet of their place of retreat, and after miraculously escaping death\r\nfrom both suffocation and fire, providentially escaped from the Island\r\nin a boat which the Indians were loading with plunder from a store.\r\nCongress in 1841, by a supplementary act, gave to the family of Dr.\r\nPERRINE the same rights before granted to him. Among the most valuable\r\nof the many plants introduced by him into Florida, was the _Agave\r\nSisalana_, (the important Hemp of commerce) * * growing now in great\r\nabundance in many localities, and especially on Key West and Key Vacas,\r\nas well as on the lands bordering upon Biscayne Bay. The township was\r\nduly located in accordance with the conditions of the grant. Owing to\r\nvarious causes beyond their control, but little has been done by the\r\nfamily toward effecting a settlement of this valuable tract. It is\r\ntheir intention now to offer such favorable inducements to settlers as\r\nwill bring together a goodly sized colony in this favored locality. So\r\nmuch of the land at and near the Miami, (the northern portion of the\r\nbay), being held under old Spanish titles, has made an undisputed title\r\nan impossibility, and prevented settlers from locating. The “Perrine\r\ngrant,” being direct from the United States, cannot be disputed. It\r\nwill be seen by the letters given hereafter from the surveyors, (Col.\r\nWILLIAMS and Mr. SWAN), that they are candid and impartial witnesses.\r\nThey have in their surveys been all over the land, and in their report\r\ngive the worst side as well as the best. Col. M. A. WILLIAMS, under\r\ndate of Aug. 6, 1875, writes: “I have in my surveys been upon every\r\npart of the ‘Perrine grant.’ It commences at a point on the west side\r\nof Biscayne Bay, about opposite to the best inlet to the bay from\r\nthe sea, and I think about from nine to eleven feet of water, can be\r\ncarried to within about two or three hundred yards of the shore at an\r\nexceedingly rich and beautiful locality upon the claim. This particular\r\nplace is settled upon by a man named ADDISON, and embraces some two\r\nor three hundred acres of excellent lands. There is a large quantity\r\nof high land (that is high for that country). In this grant there are\r\nin many places, small hammocks which are exceedingly rich, there are\r\nalso passing through the claim several savannahs, through which in wet\r\nseasons the water passes from the Everglades to the sea. The face of\r\nthe country is exceedingly rocky, rocky beyond anything that you will\r\nimagine, but the climate is pleasant and healthy, and the mosquitoes\r\nnot at all troublesome during the winter months. The Miami and the\r\ncountry adjacent upon the bay is similar in all respects to the Perrine\r\nclaim, probably not quite so rocky, but _my favorite place upon the bay\r\nis the_ ADDISON _place upon the Perrine grant_. There is a beautiful\r\nsand beach in front of this section upon the bay, and it extends South\r\nfor a mile, probably a mile and a half.” Labor is scarce, it would be\r\nbest to take it along, the same of house servants. There is timber\r\nenough for all building purposes, if there were saw-mills. The country\r\nis _remarkably healthy_, and the climate in winter and spring _cannot\r\nbe excelled_, it is pleasant even in summer. It is attractive, and will\r\ndoubtless be well populated at no distant day. The great trouble is the\r\nwant of facilities to get to and from it. It is a splendid game country\r\nupon the Perrine grant. The water is pure and good. At the ADDISON\r\nplace there are some very remarkable springs, some of them mineral.\r\nMr. WM. A. SWAN, under date of April 10, 1876, writes, in answer to\r\nthe question, what time is the best for northerners to come to the\r\nbay? “The charm and chief merit of this locality is its equability of\r\nclimate. The months of May and June I was at and near ADDISON’s; there\r\nwas no night that I did not use my blanket, and frequently my double\r\nblanket, and I learned from all sources that the only perceptible\r\ndifference in the seasons was more northers in the winter months;\r\nthey usually last about three days. Hence I would say _any_ season\r\nwas desirable. Of course it is hot, but the constant sea breeze makes\r\nit invariably pleasant. The bay is the sanitarium, so to speak, where\r\nthe garrison at Key West was sent every year to avoid yellow fever,\r\nand if it were made accessible, I do not see that there would be any\r\ncomparison between it and Long Branch and Newport, in regard to the\r\nnatural attractions and advantages. And here should be the location of\r\nthe “National Botanical Garden,” referred to in the pamphlet I sent\r\nyou to-day. At Addisons’ you can wade out half a mile before you get\r\noverhead, over a bottom of clean, white, smooth polished rock, and\r\ncertainly no more delightful bathing can be found _winter_ or _summer_.\r\nThere is nothing in the masses of rotted seaweed, grass, etc., that\r\nline the shores of this entire region, and Indian River, to create\r\nmalaria. At least the same is found wherever our troops were located,\r\nand they never got sick from any such cause. Besides, if a settlement\r\nwere made, this mass would soon be utilized by applying to fruit trees,\r\ngardens, etc. Our tents were pitched upon beds of it, and the only\r\ninjurious results, if any, were _increased voracity of appetite_! Added\r\nto the natural beauty of the bay, are the colors of the water, from\r\nthe transparent crystal to every shade of the rainbow. The latter is\r\nproduced from alternate banks of sea-grass, saw-grass, minute shells\r\nand black and brown rock. Game is abundant. Except the ten days we\r\nwere in the everglades, we were hardly ever without fresh venison and\r\nfish, and soft-shell turtle always. On the _bay_, salt water fish of\r\nall varieties; mullet, bass, trout, sheephead, carvalho, pompino,\r\ngrunts, flounders, and in a pretty little creek of fresh water that\r\nruns into and out of Addisons hammock (and which is the water station\r\nsupplying the Keys above and below in dry seasons), can be found bream,\r\ntrout, etc. At Black Point, about twelve miles below (I believe) may be\r\nfound any quantity of large fat oysters and clams, the largest I ever\r\nsaw; Col. WILLIAMS says the best he “ever ate.” In speaking of other\r\nattractions for the mere tourist or invalid, Mr. W. says: “A sail also\r\nover to the light-house, among the cocoanut and other fruit trees,\r\nthen up to the north end of the bay, 15 or 25 miles; or stop at Miami\r\nRiver. At the mouth of the river are two of the finest locations in the\r\nworld. The site of old Fort Dallas, with its fields of guavas, bananas\r\nand cocoanuts, that fringe the shore, in all stages from the bud to the\r\nripe fruit.” * * * * In the four months time we were in the vicinity of\r\nthe bay, in and through hammock, marshes, prairie, or otherwise, we did\r\nnot see a rattlesnake, nor did we see but three moccasins. The presence\r\nof so many deer and hogs, who are their natural enemies, may account\r\nfor this.” Mr. SWAN also writes: “It is not usually known the full\r\nmaturity, size and flavor of the Florida pine-apple, as compared with\r\nthose of other markets, such as the Bahamas, etc. A judicious placing\r\nin market of the Florida pine-apple and banana, would secure for them a\r\npreference over all else, and establish a reputation that would enhance\r\ntheir value, and stimulate there production to a great degree, as\r\nwell as bringing this portion of the State into that prominence which\r\nits _merits so demand_.” Again he writes: “They tell me here that two\r\nmen, with mule and cart, usually make one hundred dollars per month,\r\ngathering and preparing the coontie for market. One hand gathers twelve\r\nbarrels of the root, which makes about one and a third barrels of\r\nmarketable coontie or what is known as Florida arrow-root. The roots\r\nmuch resemble the Rutabaga turnip. It is washed and ground, then put\r\nin a stand, and water applied, stirred thoroughly and left to settle\r\nabout two hours, or until the starch “thick as soft cheese” settles to\r\nthe bottom. Then draw off all the water and change to another stand,\r\nseparating the light coontie which collects on the top, leaving the\r\npure article in the first stand, to which sufficient water should be\r\nadded to give a consistency thin enough to facilitate its passage\r\nthrough the finest sieve or strainer. Place it in dryers containing\r\ntwenty-five pounds each. In two days of good weather it is ready for\r\nmarket. The refuse or “mash” is fed to stock: horses, hogs, poultry,\r\nall thrive well upon it. By boiling the skimmings, a substance as hard\r\nas bread is produced, which keeps well, and fattens hogs for market as\r\nreadily and as well as corn.” A small saw mill is also suggested on the\r\npoint of economy, if nothing else, that you might have your own lumber\r\nsawed on the spot, for your cottages, besides the necessary boards for\r\npaling, wharf, etc., thereby saving the risk and freight in shipments\r\neither from Jacksonville, Key West or New York. As I before mentioned,\r\nlumber is from thirty to fifty dollars per thousand at Key West, and\r\nyou could manufacture and sell all you did not want for your settlers\r\nto the settlers between you and the Miami as well as on the Keys.\r\nTimber (pitch pine, no sap) is abundant, and right at hand. Attachments\r\ncould also be fixed for running coontie, sugar, and grist mills. A\r\ngreat drawback to settlers will be the inconvenience of procuring\r\nlumber. When the war in Cuba is closed a great demand will spring\r\nup for cross ties; and as this is the nearest point to Cuba (about\r\n200 miles) a decided advantage is gained by a party engaging in the\r\nbusiness here. The quantity is inexhaustible and just the size suitable\r\nfor this business. A small stock of goods, would be indispensable,\r\nas the nearest store is at Miami, and it would pay in supplying the\r\nlarge number of small coasters, spongers, etc., almost constantly in\r\nthe Cove; coming in for water, etc., as also for the convenience of\r\nthe laborers and settlers on the mainland and Keys. Everything in the\r\nline of poultry, eggs, vegetables and fruit, finds a ready market at\r\nKey West.” In compiling the foregoing facts, there may appear to be\r\nsomething like repetition; but it is owing to the endeavor to give\r\nreliable testimony, which is of course cumulative in its nature; and\r\nbeing from different and disinterested persons, touches upon the same\r\npoint oftentimes. One objective point is to induce, if possible, a\r\ngoodly number of families of culture and refinement, who are desirous\r\nof seeking new homes to join us in forming a settlement upon our grant.\r\nWe do not wish any to go who expect that there will be no discomforts\r\nto encounter, or that they can at once step into the enjoyments of all\r\nthe comforts of a luxurious home _without working_ for them. Neither\r\nshould any go (unless in the employ of others) who have not sufficient\r\nmeans to enable them to procure supplies for their own subsistence for\r\nat least one or two years. The larger capital one has, the sooner of\r\ncourse, he can place himself in a pleasant home and lay the foundation\r\nfor future competence. Intelligent and well directed industry in the\r\ncultivation of any one of the staples mentioned, viz: sugar cane, sea\r\nisland cotton, tobacco, and coontie, will yield quicker returns than\r\ntropical fruits. The banana, pine-apple, and fig, can be relied on to\r\ncommence bearing in from eighteen months to two years from setting out,\r\nso that thereafter there will be an assured income from those delicious\r\nfruits alone. Limes, lemons, oranges, tamarind and cocoanuts require\r\nlonger delay, but when once in full bearing there can be no surer or\r\nmore permanent source of income than these. Grapes also thrive most\r\nluxuriously. In the Everglades upon the islands grow large, luscious,\r\ntender grapes, which, by cultivation, would become an important article\r\nof commerce. It is believed that all of the varieties of our hot-house\r\ngrapes can be cultivated in this latitude with great success.\r\n\r\nAs an inducement to settlers, we will, to each of the first thirty-five\r\nfamilies (who will in October or November of this year, locate\r\nthemselves upon our land with a view to permanent settlement), donate\r\ntwenty acres of land free of charge, save the condition of erecting\r\na dwelling place thereon, and agreeing to cultivate at least one\r\nuseful tropical plant. For others who desire to engage largely in the\r\ncultivation of the staples named, and who wish to purchase larger\r\ntracts of land for that purpose, we will give information as to terms,\r\netc., on application to us. We will also dispose of a limited number\r\nof lots, of one and two acres each, at “Perrine,” the most eligible\r\nlocation on the bay for a town, called at present Addisons’ Landing.\r\nBoth for those who expect to make permanent homes for themselves, and\r\nthose who wish for winter residences in the South, this is a most\r\nfavorable opportunity to procure building sites at reasonable rates.\r\nNone will be sold unless on condition that a neat and substantial house\r\nshall be erected thereon within one year from date of purchase. When it\r\nis remembered that in addition to the other advantages, the temperature\r\nof this favored spot is so equable that it does not vary in some\r\n_years_ more than twenty-five degrees, its advantages as a resort for\r\ninvalids will be evident.\r\n\r\nAll communications in regard to this land can be addressed to\r\n\r\n          HENRY E. PERRINE,\r\n\r\n              602½ _Main Street, Buffalo, N. Y._, or to\r\n\r\n          JAMES E. WALKER,\r\n\r\n              736 _Broadway, Albany, N.
