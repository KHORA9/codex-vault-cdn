BABBAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nDORSET STREET, MANCHESTER SQUARE, 29th April, 1830.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the causes which have induced me to print this volume I have little\r\nto say; my own opinion is, that it will ultimately do some service\r\nto science, and without that belief I would not have undertaken so\r\nthankless a task. That it is too true not to make enemies, is an opinion\r\nin which I concur with several of my friends, although I should hope\r\nthat what I have written will not give just reason for the permanence of\r\nsuch feelings. On one point I shall speak decidedly, it is not connected\r\nin any degree with the calculating machine on which I have been engaged;\r\nthe causes which have led to it have been long operating, and would have\r\nproduced this result whether I had ever speculated on that subject, and\r\nwhatever might have been the fate of my speculations.\r\n\r\nIf any one shall endeavour to account for the opinions stated in these\r\npages by ascribing them to any imagined circumstance peculiar to myself,\r\nI think he will be mistaken. That science has long been neglected and\r\ndeclining in England, is not an opinion originating with me, but is\r\nshared by many, and has been expressed by higher authority than mine. I\r\nshall offer a few notices on this subject, which, from their scattered\r\nposition, are unlikely to have met the reader's attention, and which,\r\nwhen combined with the facts I have detailed in subsequent pages, will\r\nbe admitted to deserve considerable attention. The following extract\r\nfrom the article Chemistry, in the Encyclopaedia Metropolitana, is from\r\nthe pen of a gentleman equally qualified by his extensive reading, and\r\nfrom his acquaintance with foreign nations, to form an opinion entitled\r\nto respect. Differing from him widely as to the cause, I may be\r\npermitted to cite him as high authority for the fact.\r\n\r\n\"In concluding this most circumscribed outline of the History of\r\nChemistry, we may perhaps be allowed to express a faint shade of regret,\r\nwhich, nevertheless, has frequently passed over our minds within the\r\nspace of the last five or six years. Admiring, as we most sincerely do,\r\nthe electro-magnetic discoveries of Professor Oersted and his followers,\r\nwe still, as chemists, fear that our science has suffered some degree\r\nof neglect in consequence of them. At least, we remark that, during this\r\nperiod, good chemical analyses and researches have been rare in England;\r\nand yet, it must be confessed, there is an ample field for chemical\r\ndiscovery. How scanty is our knowledge of the suspected fluorine! Are\r\nwe sure that we understand the nature of nitrogen? And yet these are\r\namongst our elements. Much has been done by Wollaston, Berzelius,\r\nGuy-Lussac, Thenard, Thomson, Prout, and others, with regard to the\r\ndoctrine of definite proportions; but there yet remains the Atomic\r\nTheory. Is it a representation of the laws of nature, or is it\r\nnot?\"---CHEMISTRY, ENCYC. METROP. p.596.\r\n\r\nWhen the present volume was considerably advanced, the public were\r\ninformed that the late Sir Humphry Davy had commenced a work, having the\r\nsame title as the present, and that his sentiments were expressed in the\r\nlanguage of feeling and of eloquence. It is to be hoped that it may be\r\nallowed by his friends to convey his opinions to posterity, and that the\r\nwritings of the philosopher may enable his contemporaries to forget some\r\nof the deeds of the President of the Royal Society.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the fate of that highly interesting document, we may\r\ninfer his opinions upon this subject from a sentiment expressed in his\r\nlast work:--\r\n\r\n\"--But we may in vain search the aristocracy now for\r\nphilosophers.\"----\"There are very few persons who pursue science with\r\ntrue dignity; it is followed more as connected with objects of profit\r\nthan those of fame.\"--SIR H. DAVY'S CONSOLATIONS IN TRAVEL.\r\n\r\nThe last authority which I shall adduce is more valuable, from the\r\nvaried acquirements of its author, and from the greater detail into\r\nwhich he enters. \"We have drawn largely, both in the present Essay, and\r\nin our article on LIGHT, from the ANNALES DE CHEMIE, and we take this\r\nONLY opportunity distinctly to acknowledge our obligations to that most\r\nadmirably conducted work. Unlike the crude and undigested scientific\r\nmatter which suffices, (we are ashamed to say it) for the monthly and\r\nquarterly amusement of our own countrymen, whatever is admitted into ITS\r\npages, has at least been taken pains with, and, with few exceptions, has\r\nsterling merit. Indeed, among the original communications which\r\nabound in it, there are few which would misbecome the first academical\r\ncollections; and if any thing could diminish our regret at the long\r\nsuppression of those noble memoirs, which are destined to adorn future\r\nvolumes of that of the Institute, it would be the masterly abstracts\r\nof them which from time to time appear in the ANNALES, either from the\r\nhands of the authors, or from the reports rendered by the committees\r\nappointed to examine them; which latter, indeed, are universally models\r\nof their kind, and have contributed, perhaps more than any thing, to the\r\nhigh scientific tone of the French SAVANS. What author, indeed, but\r\nwill write his best, when he knows that his work, if it have merit, will\r\nimmediately be reported on by a committee, who will enter into all its\r\nmeaning; understand it, however profound: and, not content with MERELY\r\nunderstanding it, pursue the trains of thought to which it leads; place\r\nits discoveries and principles in new and unexpected lights; and bring\r\nthe whole of their knowledge of collateral subjects to bear upon it. Nor\r\nought we to omit our acknowledgement to the very valuable Journals of\r\nPoggendorff and Schweigger. Less exclusively national than their Gallic\r\ncompeer, they present a picture of the actual progress of physical\r\nscience throughout Europe. Indeed, we have been often astonished to\r\nsee with what celerity every thing, even moderately valuable in the\r\nscientific publications of this country, finds its way into their pages.\r\nThis ought to encourage our men of science. They have a larger audience,\r\nand a wider sympathy than they are perhaps aware of; and however\r\ndisheartening the general diffusion of smatterings of a number of\r\nsubjects, and the almost equally general indifference to profound\r\nknowledge in any, among their own countrymen, may be, they may rest\r\nassured that not a fact they may discover, nor a good experiment they\r\nmay make, but is instantly repeated, verified, and commented upon, in\r\nGermany, and, we may add too, in Italy. We wish the obligation were\r\nmutual. Here, whole branches of continental discovery are unstudied,\r\nand indeed almost unknown, even by name. It is in vain to conceal the\r\nmelancholy truth. We are fast dropping behind. In mathematics we have\r\nlong since drawn the rein, and given over a hopeless race. In\r\nchemistry the case is not much better. Who can tell us any thing of the\r\nSulfo-salts? Who will explain to us the laws of Isomorphism? Nay, who\r\namong us has even verified Thenard's experiments on the oxygenated\r\nacids,--Oersted's and Berzelius's on the radicals of the\r\nearths,--Balard's and Serrulas's on the combinations of Brome,--and a\r\nhundred other splendid trains of research in that fascinating science?\r\nNor need we stop here. There are, indeed, few sciences which would not\r\nfurnish matter for similar remark. The causes are at once obvious and\r\ndeep-seated; but this is not the place to discuss them.\"--MR. HERSCHEL'S\r\nTREATISE ON SOUND, printed in the ENCYCLOPAEDIA METROPOLITANA.\r\n\r\nWith such authorities, I need not apprehend much doubt as to the fact of\r\nthe decline of science in England: how far I may have pointed out some\r\nof its causes, must be left to others to decide.\r\n\r\nMany attacks have lately been made on the conduct of various scientific\r\nbodies, and of their officers, and severe criticism has been lavished\r\nupon some of their productions. Newspapers, Magazines, Reviews, and\r\nPamphlets, have all been put in requisition for the purpose. Odium has\r\nbeen cast upon some of these for being anonymous. If a fact is to be\r\nestablished by testimony, anonymous assertion is of no value; if it\r\ncan be proved, by evidence to which the public have access, it is of\r\nno consequence (for the cause of truth) who produces it. A matter of\r\nopinion derives weight from the name which is attached to it; but a\r\nchain of reasoning is equally conclusive, whoever may be its author.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it would be better for science, that all criticism should be\r\navowed. It would certainly have the effect of rendering it more matured,\r\nand less severe; but, on the other hand, it would have the evil of\r\nfrequently repressing it altogether, because there exists amongst the\r\nlower ranks of science, a \"GENUS IRRITABILE,\" who are disposed to argue\r\nthat every criticism is personal. It is clearly the interest of all who\r\nfear inquiries, to push this principle as far as possible, whilst those\r\nwhose sole object is truth, can have no apprehensions from the severest\r\nscrutiny. There are few circumstances which so strongly distinguish the\r\nphilosopher, as the calmness with which he can reply to criticisms he\r\nmay think undeservedly severe. I have been led into these reflections,\r\nfrom the circumstance of its having been stated publicly, that I was\r\nthe author of several of those anonymous writings, which were considered\r\namongst the most severe; and the assertion was the more likely to be\r\ncredited, from the fact of my having spoken a few words connected with\r\none of those subjects at the last anniversary of the Royal Society.\r\n[I merely observed that the agreement made with the British Museum for\r\nexchanging the Arundel MSS. for their duplicates, (which had just been\r\nstated by the President,) was UNWISE;--because it was not to be expected\r\nthat many duplicates should be found in a library like that of the\r\nMuseum, weak in the physical and mathematical sciences: that it was\r\nIMPROVIDENT and UNBUSINESSLIKE;--because it neither fixed the TIME\r\nwhen the difference was to be paid, in case their duplicates should be\r\ninsufficient; nor did it appear that there were any FUNDS out of\r\nwhich the money could be procured: and I added, that it would be more\r\nadvantageous to sell the MSS., and purchase the books we wanted with the\r\nproduce.] I had hoped in that diminutive world, the world of science, my\r\ncharacter had been sufficiently known to have escaped being the subject\r\nof such a mistake; and, in taking this opportunity of correcting it, I\r\nwill add that, in the present volume, I have thought it more candid to\r\nmention distinctly those whose line of conduct I have disapproved, or\r\nwhose works I have criticised, than to leave to the reader inferences\r\nwhich he might make far more extensive than I have intended. I hope,\r\ntherefore, that where I have depicted species, no person will be so\r\nunkind to others and unjust to me, as to suppose I have described\r\nindividuals.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the cry against personality, which has been lately set\r\nup to prevent all inquiry into matters of scientific misgovernment, a\r\nfew words will suffice.\r\n\r\nI feel as strongly as any one, not merely the impropriety, but the\r\ninjustice of introducing private character into such discussions. There\r\nis, however, a maxim too well established to need any comment of mine.\r\nThe public character of every public servant is legitimate subject\r\nof discussion, and his fitness or unfitness for office may be fairly\r\ncanvassed by any person. Those whose too sensitive feelings shrink from\r\nsuch an ordeal, have no right to accept the emoluments of office, for\r\nthey know that it is the condition to which all must submit who are paid\r\nfrom the public purse.\r\n\r\nThe same principle is equally applicable to Companies, to Societies, and\r\nto Academies. Those from whose pocket the salary is drawn, and by whose\r\nappointment the officer was made, have always a right to discuss the\r\nmerits of their officers, and their modes of exercising the duties they\r\nare paid to perform.\r\n\r\nThis principle is equally applicable to the conduct of a Secretary of\r\nState, or to that of a constable; to that of a Secretary of the Royal\r\nSociety, or of an adviser to the Admiralty.\r\n\r\nWith respect to honorary officers, the case is in some measure\r\ndifferent. But the President of a society, although not recompensed by\r\nany pecuniary remuneration, enjoys a station, when the body over which\r\nhe presides possesses a high character, to which many will aspire, who\r\nwill esteem themselves amply repaid for the time they devote to the\r\noffice, by the consequence attached to it in public estimation. He,\r\ntherefore, is answerable to the Society for his conduct in their chair.\r\n\r\nThere are several societies in which the secretaries, and other\r\nofficers, have very laborious duties, and where they are unaided by a\r\ntrain of clerks, and yet no pecuniary remuneration is given to them.\r\nScience is much indebted to such men, by whose quiet and unostentatious\r\nlabours the routine of its institutions is carried on. It would be\r\nunwise, as well as ungrateful, to judge severely of the inadvertencies,\r\nor even of the negligence of such persons: nothing but weighty causes\r\nshould justify such a course.\r\n\r\nWhilst, however, I contend for the principle of discussion and inquiry\r\nin its widest sense, because I consider it equally the safeguard of our\r\nscientific as of our political institutions, I shall use it, I hope,\r\ntemperately; and having no personal feelings myself, but living in terms\r\nof intercourse with almost all, and of intimacy with several of those\r\nfrom whom I most widely differ, I shall not attempt to heap together\r\nall the causes of complaint; but, by selecting a few in different\r\ndepartments, endeavour to convince them that some alteration is\r\nessentially necessary for the promotion of that very object which we\r\nboth by such different roads pursue.\r\n\r\nI have found it necessary, in the course of this volume, to speak of the\r\ndeparted; for the misgovernment of the Royal Society has not been\r\nwholly the result of even the present race. It is said, and I think with\r\njustice, in the life of Young, inserted amongst Dr. Johnson's, that the\r\nfamous maxim, \"DE MORTUIS NIL NISI BONUM,\" \"appears to savour more of\r\nfemale weakness than of manly reason.\" The foibles and the follies of\r\nthose who are gone, may, without injury to society, repose in oblivion.\r\nBut, whoever would claim the admiration of mankind for their good\r\nactions, must prove his impartiality by fearlessly condemning their evil\r\ndeeds. Adopt the maxim, and praise to the dead becomes worthless, from\r\nits universality; and history, a greater fable than it has been hitherto\r\ndeemed.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I ought to apologize for the large space I have devoted to the\r\nRoyal Society. Certainly its present state gives it no claim to that\r\nattention; and I do it partly from respect for its former services,\r\nand partly from the hope that, if such an Institution can be of use to\r\nscience in the present day, the attention of its members may be excited\r\nto take steps for its restoration. Perhaps I may be blamed for having\r\npublished extracts from the minutes of its proceedings without the\r\npermission of its Council. To have asked permission of the present\r\nCouncil would have been useless. I might, however, have given the\r\nsubstance of what I have extracted without the words, and no one could\r\nthen have reproached me with any infringement of our rules: but\r\nthere were two objections to that course. In the first place, it is\r\nimpossible, even for the most candid, in all cases, to convey precisely\r\nthe same sentiment in different language; and I thought it therefore\r\nmore fair towards those from whom I differed, as well as to the public,\r\nto give the precise words. Again: had it been possible to make so\r\naccurate a paraphrase, I should yet have preferred the risk of incurring\r\nthe reproach of the Royal Society for the offence, to escaping their\r\ncensure by an evasion. What I have done rests on my own head; and I\r\nshrink not from the responsibility attaching to it.\r\n\r\nIf those, whose mismanagement of that Society I condemn, should accuse\r\nme of hostility to the Royal Society; my answer is, that the party which\r\ngoverns it is not the Royal Society; and that I will only admit the\r\njustice of the accusation, when the whole body, becoming acquainted\r\nwith the system I have exposed, shall, by ratifying it with their\r\napprobation, appropriate it to themselves: an event of which I need\r\nscarcely add I have not the slightest anticipation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  PREFACE\r\n  Introductory Remarks\r\n  CHAP.

That a country, eminently distinguished for its mechanical\r\nand manufacturing ingenuity, should be indifferent to the progress of\r\ninquiries which form the highest departments of that knowledge on whose\r\nmore elementary truths its wealth and rank depend, is a fact which is\r\nwell deserving the attention of those who shall inquire into the causes\r\nthat influence the progress of nations.\r\n\r\nTo trace the gradual decline of mathematical, and with it of the highest\r\ndepartments of physical science, from the days of Newton to the present,\r\nmust be left to the historian. It is not within the province of one who,\r\nhaving mixed sufficiently with scientific society in England to see\r\nand regret the weakness of some of its greatest ornaments, and to see\r\nthrough and deplore the conduct of its pretended friends, offers these\r\nremarks, with the hope that they may excite discussion,--with the\r\nconviction that discussion is the firmest ally of truth,--and with the\r\nconfidence that nothing but the full expression of public opinion can\r\nremove the evils that chill the enthusiasm, and cramp the energies of\r\nthe science of England.\r\n\r\nThe causes which have produced, and some of the effects which have\r\nresulted from, the present state of science in England, are so mixed,\r\nthat it is difficult to distinguish accurately between them. I shall,\r\ntherefore, in this volume, not attempt any minute discrimination,\r\nbut rather present the result of my reflections on the concomitant\r\ncircumstances which have attended the decay, and at the conclusion of\r\nit, shall examine some of the suggestions which have been offered for\r\nthe advancement of British science.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I. ON THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE OF SCIENCE AND EDUCATION.\r\n\r\nThat the state of knowledge in any country will exert a directive\r\ninfluence on the general system of instruction adopted in it, is a\r\nprinciple too obvious to require investigation. And it is equally\r\ncertain that the tastes and pursuits of our manhood will bear on them\r\nthe traces of the earlier impressions of our education. It is therefore\r\nnot unreasonable to suppose that some portion of the neglect of science\r\nin England, may be attributed to the system of education we pursue. A\r\nyoung man passes from our public schools to the universities, ignorant\r\nalmost of the elements of every branch of useful knowledge; and at these\r\nlatter establishments, formed originally for instructing those who\r\nare intended for the clerical profession, classical and mathematical\r\npursuits are nearly the sole objects proposed to the student's ambition.\r\n\r\nMuch has been done at one of our universities during the last fifteen\r\nyears, to improve the system of study; and I am confident that there\r\nis no one connected with that body, who will not do me the justice to\r\nbelieve that, whatever suggestions I may venture to offer, are prompted\r\nby the warmest feelings for the honour and the increasing prosperity of\r\nits institutions. The ties which connect me with Cambridge are indeed of\r\nno ordinary kind.\r\n\r\nTaking it then for granted that our system of academical education ought\r\nto be adapted to nearly the whole of the aristocracy of the country, I\r\nam inclined to believe that whilst the modifications I should propose\r\nwould not be great innovations on the spirit of our institutions, they\r\nwould contribute materially to that important object.\r\n\r\nIt will be readily admitted, that a degree conferred by an university,\r\nought to be a pledge to the public that he who holds it possesses a\r\ncertain quantity of knowledge. The progress of society has rendered\r\nknowledge far more various in its kinds than it used to be; and to meet\r\nthis variety in the tastes and inclinations of those who come to us for\r\ninstruction, we have, besides the regular lectures to which all must\r\nattend, other sources of information from whence the students may\r\nacquire sound and varied knowledge in the numerous lectures on\r\nchemistry, geology, botany, history, &c. It is at present a matter of\r\noption with the student, which, and how many of these courses he shall\r\nattend, and such it should still remain. All that it would be necessary\r\nto add would be, that previously to taking his degree, each person\r\nshould be examined by those Professors, whose lectures he had attended.\r\nThe pupils should then be arranged in two classes, according to their\r\nmerits, and the names included in these classes should be printed. I\r\nwould then propose that no young man, except his name was found amongst\r\nthe \"List of Honours,\" should be allowed to take his degree, unless he\r\nhad been placed in the first class of some one at least of the courses\r\ngiven by the professors. But it should still be imperative upon the\r\nstudent to possess such mathematical knowledge as we usually require. If\r\nhe had attained the first rank in several of these examinations, it\r\nis obvious that we should run no hazard in a little relaxing the\r\nstrictness of his mathematical trial.\r\n\r\nIf it should be thought preferable, the sciences might be grouped, and\r\nthe following subjects be taken together:--\r\n\r\n     Modern History.\r\n     Laws of England.\r\n     Civil Law.\r\n\r\n     Political Economy.\r\n     Applications of Science to Arts and Manufactures.\r\n\r\n     Chemistry.\r\n     Mineralogy.\r\n     Geology.\r\n\r\n     Zoology, including Physiology and Comparative Anatomy.\r\n     Botany, including Vegetable Physiology and Anatomy.\r\n\r\nOne of the great advantages of such a system would be, that no young\r\nperson would have an excuse for not studying, by stating, as is most\r\nfrequently done, that the only pursuits followed at Cambridge, classics\r\nand mathematics, are not adapted either to his taste, or to the wants of\r\nhis after life. His friends and relatives would then reasonably expect\r\nevery student to have acquired distinction in SOME pursuit. If it should\r\nbe feared that this plan would lead to too great a diversity of pursuits\r\nin the same individual, a limitation might be placed upon the number of\r\nexaminations into which the same person might be permitted to enter. It\r\nmight also be desirable not to restrict the whole of these examinations\r\nto the third year, but to allow the student to enter on some portion of\r\nthem in the first or second year, if he should prefer it.\r\n\r\nBy such an arrangement, which would scarcely interfere seriously with\r\nour other examinations, we should, I think, be enabled effectually to\r\nkeep pace with the wants of society, and retaining fully our power\r\nand our right to direct the studies of those who are intended for the\r\nchurch, as well as of those who aspire to the various offices connected\r\nwith our academical institutions; we should, at the same time, open\r\na field of honourable ambition to multitudes, who, from the exclusive\r\nnature of our present studies, leave us with but a very limited addition\r\nto their stock of knowledge.\r\n\r\nMuch more might be said on a subject so important to the interests of\r\nthe country, as well as of our university, but my wish is merely to open\r\nit for our own consideration and discussion. We have already done so\r\nmuch for the improvement of our system of instruction, that public\r\nopinion will not reproach us for any unwillingness to alter. It is our\r\nfirst duty to be well satisfied that we can improve: such alterations\r\nought only to be the result of a most mature consideration, and of a\r\nfree interchange of sentiments on the subject, in order that we may\r\ncondense upon the question the accumulated judgment of many minds.\r\n\r\nIt is in some measure to be attributed to the defects of our system of\r\neducation, that scientific knowledge scarcely exists amongst the\r\nhigher classes of society. The discussions in the Houses of Lords or of\r\nCommons, which arise on the occurrence of any subjects connected with\r\nscience, sufficiently prove this fact, which, if I had consulted the\r\nextremely limited nature of my personal experience, I should, perhaps,\r\nhave doubted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II. OF THE INDUCEMENTS TO INDIVIDUALS TO CULTIVATE SCIENCE.\r\n\r\nInterest or inclination form the primary and ruling motives in this\r\nmatter: and both these exert greater or less proportionate influence in\r\neach of the respective cases to be examined.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION 1. PROFESSIONAL IMPULSES.\r\n\r\nA large portion of those who are impelled by ambition or necessity to\r\nadvance themselves in the world, make choice of some profession in which\r\nthey imagine their talents likely to be rewarded with success; and there\r\nare peculiar advantages resulting to each from this classification of\r\nsociety into professions. The ESPRIT DE CORPS frequently overpowers the\r\njealousy which exists between individuals, and pushes on to advantageous\r\nsituations some of the more fortunate of the profession; whilst, on the\r\nother hand, any injury or insult offered to the weakest, is redressed or\r\nresented by the whole body. There are other advantages which are perhaps\r\nof more importance to the public. The numbers which compose the learned\r\nprofessions in England are so considerable, that a kind of public\r\nopinion is generated amongst them, which powerfully tends to repress\r\nconduct that is injurious either to the profession or to the public.\r\nAgain, the mutual jealousy and rivalry excited amongst the whole body\r\nis so considerable, that although the rank and estimation which an\r\nindividual holds in the profession may be most unfairly appreciated,\r\nby taking the opinion of his rival; yet few estimations will be found\r\ngenerally more correct than the opinion of a whole profession on the\r\nmerits of any one of its body. This test is of great value to the\r\npublic, and becomes the more so, in proportion to the difficulty of the\r\nstudy to which the profession is devoted. It is by availing themselves\r\nof it that men of sense and judgment, who have occasion for the services\r\nof professional persons, are, in a great measure, guided in their\r\nchoice.\r\n\r\nThe pursuit of science does not, in England, constitute a distinct\r\nprofession, as it does in many other countries. It is therefore, on\r\nthat ground alone, deprived of many of the advantages which attach\r\nto professions. One of its greatest misfortunes arises from this\r\ncircumstance; for the subjects on which it is conversant are so\r\ndifficult, and require such unremitted devotion of time, that few who\r\nhave not spent years in their study can judge of the relative knowledge\r\nof those who pursue them. It follows, therefore, that the public, and\r\neven that men of sound sense and discernment, can scarcely find means\r\nto distinguish between the possessors of knowledge, in the present\r\nday, merely elementary, and those whose acquirements are of the highest\r\norder. This remark applies with peculiar force to all the more difficult\r\napplications of mathematics; and the fact is calculated to check the\r\nenergies of those who only look to reputation in England.\r\n\r\nAs there exists with us no peculiar class professedly devoted to\r\nscience, it frequently happens that when a situation, requiring for the\r\nproper fulfilment of its duties considerable scientific attainments, is\r\nvacant, it becomes necessary to select from among amateurs, or rather\r\nfrom among persons whose chief attention has been bestowed on other\r\nsubjects, and to whom science has been only an occasional pursuit.\r\nA certain quantity of scientific knowledge is of course possessed by\r\nindividuals in many professions; and when added to the professional\r\nacquirements of the army, the navy, or to the knowledge of the merchant,\r\nis highly meritorious: but it is obvious that this may become, when\r\nseparated from the profession, quite insignificant as the basis of a\r\nscientific reputation.\r\n\r\nTo those who have chosen the profession of medicine, a knowledge of\r\nchemistry, and of some branches of natural history, and, indeed, of\r\nseveral other departments of science, affords useful assistance. Some of\r\nthe most valuable names which adorn the history of English science have\r\nbeen connected with this profession.\r\n\r\nThe causes which induce the selection of the clerical profession are\r\nnot often connected with science; and it is, perhaps, a question of\r\nconsiderable doubt whether it is desirable to hold out to its members\r\nhopes of advancement from such acquirements. As a source of recreation,\r\nnothing can be more fit to occupy the attention of a divine; and our\r\nchurch may boast, in the present as in past times, that the domain of\r\nscience has been extended by some of its brightest ornaments.\r\n\r\nIn England, the profession of the law is that which seems to hold out\r\nthe strongest attraction to talent, from the circumstance, that in it\r\nability, coupled with exertion, even though unaided by patronage, cannot\r\nfail of obtaining reward. It is frequently chosen as an introduction\r\nto public life. It also presents great advantages, from its being a\r\nqualification for many situations more or less remotely connected\r\nwith it, as well as from the circumstance that several of the highest\r\nofficers of the state must necessarily have sprung from its ranks.\r\n\r\nA powerful attraction exists, therefore, to the promotion of a study and\r\nof duties of all others engrossing the time most completely, and which\r\nis less benefited than most others by any acquaintance with science.\r\nThis is one amongst the causes why it so very rarely happens that men in\r\npublic situations are at all conversant even with the commonest branches\r\nof scientific knowledge, and why scarcely an instance can be cited of\r\nsuch persons acquiring a reputation by any discoveries of their own.\r\n\r\nBut, however consistent other sciences may be with professional\r\navocations, there is one which, from its extreme difficulty, and the\r\noverwhelming attention which it demands, can only be pursued with\r\nsuccess by those whose leisure is undisturbed by other claims. To be\r\nwell acquainted with the present state of mathematics, is no easy task;\r\nbut to add to the powers which that science possesses, is likely to be\r\nthe lot of but few English philosophers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION 2. OF NATIONAL ENCOURAGEMENT.\r\n\r\nThe little encouragement which at all previous periods has been afforded\r\nby the English Government to the authors of useful discoveries, or of\r\nnew and valuable inventions, is justified on the following grounds:\r\n\r\n1. The public, who consume the new commodity or profit by the new\r\ninvention, are much better judges of its merit than the government can\r\nbe.\r\n\r\n2. The reward which arises from the sale of the commodity is usually\r\nmuch larger than that which government would be justified in bestowing;\r\nand it is exactly proportioned to the consumption, that is, to the want\r\nwhich the public feel for the new article.\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted that, as general principles, these are correct:\r\nthere are, however, exceptions which flow necessarily from the very\r\nreasoning from which they were deduced. Without entering minutely into\r\nthese exceptions, it will be sufficient to show that all abstract truth\r\nis entirely excluded from reward under this system. It is only the\r\napplication of principles to common life which can be thus rewarded.\r\nA few instances may perhaps render this position more evident. The\r\nprinciple of the hydrostatic paradox was known as a speculative truth\r\nin the time of Stevinus; [About the year 1600] and its application to\r\nraising heavy weights has long been stated in elementary treatises on\r\nnatural philosophy, as well as constantly exhibited in lectures. Yet, it\r\nmay fairly be regarded as a mere abstract principle, until the late Mr.\r\nBramah, by substituting a pump instead of the smaller column, converted\r\nit into a most valuable and powerful engine.--The principle of the\r\nconvertibility of the centres of oscillation and suspension in the\r\npendulum, discovered by Huygens more than a century and a half ago,\r\nremained, until within these few years, a sterile, though most elegant\r\nproposition; when, after being hinted at by Prony, and distinctly\r\npointed out by Bonenberger, it was employed by Captain Kater as the\r\nfoundation of a most convenient practical method of determining the\r\nlength of the pendulum.--The interval which separated the discovery, by\r\nDr. Black, of latent heat, from the beautiful and successful application\r\nof it to the steam engine, was comparatively short; but it required the\r\nefforts of two minds; and both were of the highest order.--The influence\r\nof electricity in producing decompositions, although of inestimable\r\nvalue as an instrument of discovery in chemical inquiries, can hardly be\r\nsaid to have been applied to the practical purposes of life, until the\r\nsame powerful genius which detected the principle, applied it, by\r\na singular felicity of reasoning, to arrest the corrosion of the\r\ncopper-sheathing of vessels. That admirably connected chain of\r\nreasoning, the truth of which is confirmed by its very failure as a\r\nremedy, will probably at some future day supply, by its successful\r\napplication, a new proof of the position we are endeavouring to\r\nestablish.\r\n\r\n[I am authorised in stating, that this was regarded by Laplace as the\r\ngreatest of Sir Humphry Davy's discoveries. It did not fail in producing\r\nthe effect foreseen by Sir H. Davy,--the preventing the corrosion of\r\nthe copper; but it failed as a cure of the evil, by producing one of an\r\nOPPOSITE character; either by preserving too perfectly from decay the\r\nsurface of the copper, or by rendering it negative, it allowed marine\r\nanimals and vegetables to accumulate on its surface, and thus impede the\r\nprogress of the vessel.]\r\n\r\nOther instances might, if necessary, be adduced, to show that long\r\nintervals frequently elapse between the discovery of new principles\r\nin science and their practical application: nor ought this at all to\r\nsurprise us. Those intellectual qualifications, which give birth to new\r\nprinciples or to new methods, are of quite a different order from those\r\nwhich are necessary for their practical application.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the discovery of the beautiful theorem of Huygens,\r\nit required in its author not merely a complete knowledge of the\r\nmathematical science of his age, but a genius to enlarge its boundaries\r\nby new creations of his own. Such talents are not always united with a\r\nquick perception of the details, and of the practical applications\r\nof the principles they have developed, nor is it for the interest of\r\nmankind that minds of this high order should lavish their powers on\r\nsubjects unsuited to their grasp.\r\n\r\nIn mathematical science, more than in all others, it happens that truths\r\nwhich are at one period the most abstract, and apparently the most\r\nremote from all useful application, become in the next age the bases\r\nof profound physical inquiries, and in the succeeding one, perhaps, by\r\nproper simplification and reduction to tables, furnish their ready and\r\ndaily aid to the artist and the sailor.\r\n\r\nIt may also happen that at the time of the discovery of such principles,\r\nthe mechanical arts may be too imperfect to render their application\r\nlikely to be attended with success. Such was the case with the principle\r\nof the hydrostatic paradox; and it was not, I believe, until the\r\nexpiration of Mr. Bramah's patent, that the press which bears his\r\nname received that mechanical perfection in its execution, which has\r\ndeservedly brought it into such general use.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, for one person who is blessed with the power of\r\ninvention, many will always be found who have the capacity of applying\r\nprinciples; and much of the merit ascribed to these applications will\r\nalways depend on the care and labour bestowed in the practical detail.\r\n\r\nIf, therefore, it is important to the country that abstract principles\r\nshould be applied to practical use, it is clear that it is also\r\nimportant that encouragement should be held out to the few who\r\nare capable of adding to the number of those truths on which such\r\napplications are founded. Unless there exist peculiar institutions\r\nfor the support of such inquirers, or unless the Government directly\r\ninterfere, the contriver of a thaumatrope may derive profit from his\r\ningenuity, whilst he who unravels the laws of light and vision, on which\r\nmultitudes of phenomena depend, shall descend unrewarded to the tomb.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it may be urged, that sufficient encouragement is already\r\nafforded to abstract science in our different universities, by the\r\nprofessorships established at them. It is not however in the power of\r\nsuch institutions to create; they may foster and aid the development of\r\ngenius; and, when rightly applied, such stations ought to be its fair\r\nand honourable rewards. In many instances their emolument is small; and\r\nwhen otherwise, the lectures which are required from the professor are\r\nnot perhaps in all cases the best mode of employing the energies of\r\nthose who are capable of inventing.\r\n\r\nI cannot resist the opportunity of supporting these opinions by the\r\nauthority of one of the greatest philosophers of a past age, and of\r\nexpressing my acknowledgments to the author of a most interesting piece\r\nof scientific biography. In the correspondence which terminated in the\r\nreturn of Galileo to a professorship in his native country, he remarks,\r\n\"But, because my private lectures and domestic pupils are a great\r\nhinderance and interruption of my studies, I wish to live entirely\r\nexempt from the former, and in great measure from the latter.\"--LIFE\r\nOF GALILEO, p.18. And, in another letter to Kepler, he speaks with\r\ngratitude of Cosmo, the Grand Duke of Tuscany, who \"has now invited me\r\nto attach myself to him with the annual salary of 1000 florins, and with\r\nthe title of Philosopher and principal Mathematician to his Highness,\r\nwithout the duties of any office to perform, but with most complete\r\nleisure; so that I can complete my treatise on Mechanics, &c.\"--p.31.\r\n[Life of Galileo, published by the Society for the Diffusion of Useful\r\nKnowledge.]\r\n\r\nSurely, if knowledge is valuable, it can never be good policy in a\r\ncountry far wealthier than Tuscany, to allow a genius like Mr. Dalton's,\r\nto be employed in the drudgery of elementary instruction. [I utter these\r\nsentiments from no feelings of private friendship to that estimable\r\nphilosopher, to whom it is my regret to be almost unknown, and whose\r\nmodest and retiring merit, I may, perhaps, have the misfortune to offend\r\nby these remarks. But Mr. Dalton was of no party; had he ever moved in\r\nthat vortex which has brought discredit, and almost ruin, on the Royal\r\nSociety of England;--had he taken part with those who vote to each other\r\nmedals, and, affecting to be tired of the fatigues of office, make to\r\neach other requisitions to retain places they would be most reluctant\r\nto quit; his great and splendid discovery would long since have been\r\nrepresented to government. Expectant mediocrity would have urged on his\r\nclaims to remuneration, and those who covered their selfish purposes\r\nwith the cloak of science, would have hastened to shelter themselves in\r\nthe mantle of his glory.--But the philosopher may find consolation for\r\nthe tardy approbation of that Society, in the applause of Europe. If\r\nhe was insulted by their medal, he escaped the pain of seeing his name\r\nconnected with their proceedings.] Where would have been the military\r\nrenown of England, if, with an equally improvident waste of mental\r\npower, its institutions had forced the Duke of Wellington to employ his\r\nlife in drilling recruits, instead of planning campaigns?\r\n\r\nIf we look at the fact, we shall find that the great inventions of the\r\nage are not, with us at least, always produced in universities. The\r\ndoctrines of \"definite proportions,\" and of the \"chemical agency of\r\nelectricity,\"--principles of a high order, which have immortalized the\r\nnames of their discoverers,--were not produced by the meditations of\r\nthe cloister: nor is it in the least a reproach to those valuable\r\ninstitutions to mention truths like these. Fortunate circumstances must\r\nconcur, even to the greatest, to render them eminently successful. It is\r\nnot permitted to all to be born, like Archimedes, when a science was to\r\nbe created; nor, like Newton, to find the system of the world \"without\r\nform and void;\" and, by disclosing gravitation, to shed throughout that\r\nsystem the same irresistible radiance as that with which the Almighty\r\nCreator had illumined its material substance. It can happen to but few\r\nphilosophers, and but at distant intervals, to snatch a science, like\r\nDalton, from the chaos of indefinite combination, and binding it in the\r\nchains of number, to exalt it to rank amongst the exact. Triumphs like\r\nthese are necessarily \"few and far between;\" nor can it be expected that\r\nthat portion of encouragement, which a country may think fit to bestow\r\non science, should be adapted to meet such instances. Too extraordinary\r\nto be frequent, they must be left, if they are to be encouraged at all,\r\nto some direct interference of the government.\r\n\r\nThe dangers to be apprehended from such a specific interference, would\r\narise from one, or several, of the following circumstances:--That class\r\nof society, from whom the government is selected, might not possess\r\nsufficient knowledge either to judge themselves, or know upon whose\r\njudgment to rely. Or the number of persons devoting themselves to\r\nscience, might not be sufficiently large to have due weight in the\r\nexpression of public opinion. Or, supposing this class to be large, it\r\nmight not enjoy, in the estimation of the world, a sufficiently high\r\ncharacter for independence. Should these causes concur in any country,\r\nit might become highly injurious to commit the encouragement of science\r\nto any department of the government. This reasoning does not appear to\r\nhave escaped the penetration of those who advised the abolition of the\r\nlate Board of Longitude.\r\n\r\nThe question whether it is good policy in the government of a country\r\nto encourage science, is one of which those who cultivate it are not\r\nperhaps the most unbiased judges. In England, those who have hitherto\r\npursued science, have in general no very reasonable grounds of\r\ncomplaint; they knew, or should have known, that there was no demand for\r\nit, that it led to little honour, and to less profit.\r\n\r\nThat blame has been attributed to the government for not fostering\r\nthe science of the country is certain; and, as far as regards past\r\nadministrations, is, to a great extent, just; with respect to the\r\npresent ministers, whose strength essentially depends on public opinion,\r\nit is not necessary that they should precede, and they cannot remain\r\nlong insensible to any expression of the general feeling. But supposing\r\nscience were thought of some importance by any administration, it would\r\nbe difficult in the present state of things to do much in its favour;\r\nbecause, on the one hand, the higher classes in general have not a\r\nprofound knowledge of science, and, on the other, those persons whom\r\nthey have usually consulted, seem not to have given such advice as to\r\ndeserve the confidence of government. It seems to be forgotten, that the\r\nmoney allotted by government to purposes of science ought to be expended\r\nwith the same regard to prudence and economy as in the disposal of money\r\nin the affairs of private life.\r\n\r\n[Who, for instance, could have advised the government to incur the\r\nexpense of printing SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY copies of the Astronomical\r\nObservations made at Paramatta, to form a third part of the\r\nPhilosophical Transactions for 1829, whilst of the Observations made at\r\nthe Royal Observatory at Greenwich, two hundred and fifty copies only\r\nare printed?\r\n\r\nOf these seven hundred and fifty copies, seven hundred and ten will be\r\ndistributed to members of the Royal Society, to six hundred of whom they\r\nwill probably be wholly uninteresting or useless; and thus the country\r\nincurs a constantly recurring annual expense. Nor is it easy to see\r\non what principle a similar destination could be refused for the\r\nobservations made at the Cape of Good Hope.]\r\n\r\nTo those who measure the question of the national encouragement of\r\nscience by its value in pounds, shillings, and pence, I will here state\r\na fact, which, although pretty generally known, still, I think, deserves\r\nattention. A short time since it was discovered by government that the\r\nterms on which annuities had been granted by them were erroneous, and\r\nnew tables were introduced by act of Parliament. It was stated at the\r\ntime that the erroneous tables had caused a loss to the country of\r\nbetween two and three millions sterling. The fact of the sale of\r\nthose annuities being a losing concern was long known to many; and the\r\ngovernment appear to have been the last to be informed on the subject.\r\nHalf the interest of half that loss, judiciously applied to the\r\nencouragement of mathematical science, would, in a few years, have\r\nrendered utterly impossible such expensive errors.\r\n\r\nTo those who bow to the authority of great names, one remark may have\r\nits weight. The MECANIQUE COELESTE, [The first volume of the first\r\ntranslation of this celebrated work into our own language, has just\r\narrived in England from--America.] and the THEORIE ANALYTIQUE DES\r\nPROBABILITES, were both dedicated, by Laplace, to Napoleon. During the\r\nreign of that extraordinary man, the triumphs of France were as eminent\r\nin Science as they were splendid in arms. May the institutions which\r\ntrained and rewarded her philosophers be permanent as the benefits they\r\nhave conferred upon mankind!\r\n\r\nIn other countries it has been found, and is admitted, that a knowledge\r\nof science is a recommendation to public appointments, and that a man\r\ndoes not make a worse ambassador because he has directed an observatory,\r\nor has added by his discoveries to the extent of our knowledge of\r\nanimated nature. Instances even are not wanting of ministers who have\r\nbegun their career in the inquiries of pure analysis. As such examples\r\nare perhaps more frequent than is generally imagined, it may be useful\r\nto mention a few of those men of science who have formerly held, or who\r\nnow hold, high official stations in the governments of their respective\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\n\r\n Country.

Lindenau, the Minister from the King of Saxony to the King of the\r\nNetherlands, commenced his career as astronomer at the observatory of\r\nthe Grand Duke of Gotha, by whom he was sent as his representative at\r\nthe German Diet. On the death of the late reigning Duke, M. Lindenau\r\nwas invited to Dresden, and filled the same situation under the King of\r\nSaxony; after which he was appointed his minister at the court of the\r\nKing of the Netherlands. Such occurrences are not to be paralleled in\r\nour own country, at least not in modern times. Newton was, it is true,\r\nmore than a century since, appointed Master of the Mint; but let any\r\nperson suggest an appointment of a similar kind in the present day, and\r\nhe will gather from the smiles of those to whom he proposes it that the\r\nhighest knowledge conduces nothing to success, and that political power\r\nis almost the only recommendation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION 3. Of Encouragement from Learned Societies.\r\n\r\nThere are several circumstances which concur in inducing persons\r\npursuing science, to unite together, to form societies or academies. In\r\nformer times, when philosophical instruments were more rare, and the art\r\nof making experiments was less perfectly known, it was almost necessary.\r\nMore recently, whilst numerous additions are constantly making to\r\nscience, it has been found that those who are most capable of extending\r\nhuman knowledge, are frequently least able to encounter the expense of\r\nprinting their investigations. It is therefore convenient, that some\r\nmeans should be devised for relieving them from this difficulty, and the\r\nvolumes of the transactions of academies have accomplished the desired\r\nend.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, another purpose to which academies contribute.\r\nWhen they consist of a limited number of persons, eminent for their\r\nknowledge, it becomes an object of ambition to be admitted on their\r\nlist. Thus a stimulus is applied to all those who cultivate science,\r\nwhich urges on their exertions, in order to acquire the wished-for\r\ndistinction. It is clear that this envied position will be valued\r\nin proportion to the difficulty of its attainment, and also to the\r\ncelebrity of those who enjoy it; and whenever the standard of scientific\r\nknowledge which qualifies for its ranks is lowered, the value of the\r\ndistinction itself will be diminished. If, at any time, a multitude of\r\npersons having no sort of knowledge of science are admitted, it must\r\ncease to be sought after as an object of ambition by men of science, and\r\nthe class of persons to whom it will become an object of desire will be\r\nless intellectual.\r\n\r\nLet us now compare the numbers composing some of the various academies\r\nof Europe.-The Royal Society of London, the Institute of France, the\r\nItalian Academy of Forty, and the Royal Academy of Berlin, are amongst\r\nthe most distinguished.\r\n\r\n     Name                          Number of      Number\r\n                    Population.

That in Italy and Prussia, about one out of 300,000\r\npersons is a member of their Academies. That in England, every 32,000\r\ninhabitants produces a Fellow of the Royal Society. Looking merely at\r\nthese proportions, the estimation of a seat in the Academy of Berlin,\r\nmust be more than nine times as valuable as a similar situation in\r\nEngland; and a member of the Institute of France will be more than\r\nthirteen times more rare in his country than a Fellow of the Royal\r\nSociety is in England.\r\n\r\nFavourable as this view is to the dignity of such situations in other\r\ncountries, their comparative rarity is by no means the most striking\r\ndifference in the circumstances of men of science. If we look at the\r\nstation in society occupied by the SAVANS of other countries, in several\r\nof them we shall find it high, and their situations profitable. Perhaps,\r\nat the present moment, Prussia is, of all the countries in Europe, that\r\nwhich bestows the greatest attention, and most unwearied encouragement\r\non science. Great as are the merits of many of its philosophers, much of\r\nthis support arises from the character of the reigning family, by whose\r\nenlightened policy even the most abstract sciences are fostered.\r\n\r\nThe maxim that \"knowledge is power,\" can be perfectly comprehended\r\nby those only who are themselves well versed in science; and to the\r\ncircumstance of the younger branches of the royal family of Prussia\r\nhaving acquired considerable knowledge in such subjects, we may\r\nattribute the great force with which that maxim is appreciated.\r\n\r\nIn France, the situation of its SAVANS is highly respectable, as well as\r\nprofitable. If we analyze the list of the Institute, we shall find few\r\nwho do not possess titles or decorations; but as the value of such marks\r\nof royal favour must depend, in a great measure, on their frequency, I\r\nshall mention several particulars which are probably not familiar to\r\nthe English reader. [This analysis was made by comparing the list of the\r\nInstitute, printed for that body in 1827, with the ALMANACH ROYALE for\r\n1823.]\r\n\r\n\r\n     Number of the Members of the      Total Number of each Class\r\n     Institute of France who belong    of the Legion of Honour.\r\n     to the Legion of Honour.\r\n\r\n     GrandCroix.........  3                    80\r\n     GrandOfficier.....   3                   160\r\n     Commandeur........   4                   400\r\n     Officier..........  17                 2,000\r\n     Chevalier.........  40               Not limited.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     Number of Members of the Institute      Total Number\r\n     decorated with                          of\r\n     the Order of St. Michel.                that Order.\r\n\r\n     Grand Croix.......  2\r\n                                               100\r\n     Chevalier......... 27\r\n\r\n     Amongst the members of the Institute there\r\n     are,--\r\n\r\n     Dukes...................  2\r\n     Marquis.................  1\r\n     Counts..................  4\r\n     Viscounts................ 2\r\n     Barons.................. 14\r\n                               --23\r\n\r\n     Of these there are\r\n     Peers of France.......... 5\r\n\r\nWe might, on turning over the list of the 685 members of the Royal\r\nSociety, find a greater number of peers than there are in the Institute\r\nof France; but a fairer mode of instituting the comparison, is to\r\ninquire how many titled members there are amongst those who have\r\ncontributed to its Transactions. In 1827, there were one hundred and\r\nnine members who had contributed to the Transactions of the Royal\r\nSociety; amongst these were found:--\r\n\r\n     Peer........................ 1\r\n     Baronets.................... 5\r\n     Knights..................... 5\r\n\r\nIt should be observed, that five of these titles were the rewards of\r\nmembers of the medical profession, and one only, that of Sir H. Davy,\r\ncould be attributed exclusively to science.\r\n\r\nIt must not be inferred that the titles of nobility in the French list,\r\nwere all of them the rewards of scientific eminence; many are known to\r\nhave been such; but it would be quite sufficient for the argument to\r\nmention the names of Lagrange, Laplace, Berthollet, and Chaptal.\r\n\r\nThe estimation in which the public hold literary claims in France and\r\nEngland, was curiously illustrated by an incidental expression in the\r\ntranslation of the debates in the House of Lords, on the occasion of His\r\nMajesty's speech at the commencement of the session of 1830. The Gazette\r\nde France stated, that the address was moved by the Duc de Buccleugh,\r\n\"CHEF DE LA MAISON DE WALTER SCOTT.\" Had an English editor wished to\r\nparticularize that nobleman, he would undoubtedly have employed the term\r\nWEALTHY, or some other of the epithets characteristic of that quality\r\nmost esteemed amongst his countrymen.\r\n\r\nIf we turn, on the other hand, to the emoluments of science in France,\r\nwe shall find them far exceed those in our own country. I regret much\r\nthat I have mislaid a most interesting memorandum on this subject, which\r\nI made several years since: but I believe my memory on the point will\r\nnot be found widely incorrect. A foreign gentleman, himself possessing\r\nno inconsiderable acquaintance with science, called on me a few years\r\nsince, to present a letter of introduction. He had been but a short time\r\nin London; and, in the course of our conversation, it appeared to me\r\nthat he had imbibed very inaccurate ideas respecting our encouragement\r\nof science.\r\n\r\nThinking this a good opportunity of instituting a fair comparison\r\nbetween the emoluments of science in the two countries, I placed a sheet\r\nof paper before him, and requested him to write down the names of six\r\nEnglishmen, in his opinion, best known in France for their scientific\r\nreputation. Taking another sheet of paper, I wrote upon it the names of\r\nsix Frenchmen, best known in England for their scientific discoveries.\r\nWe exchanged these lists, and I then requested him to place against each\r\nname (as far as he knew) the annual income of the different appointments\r\nheld by that person. In the mean time, I performed the same operation on\r\nhis list, against some names of which I was obliged to place a ZERO. The\r\nresult of the comparison was an average of nearly 1200L. per annum for\r\nthe six French SAVANS whom I had named. Of the average amount of the\r\nsums received by the English, I only remember that it was very much\r\nsmaller. When we consider what a command over the necessaries and\r\nluxuries of life 1200L. will give in France, it is underrating it to say\r\nit is equal to 2000L. in this country.\r\n\r\nLet us now look at the prospects of a young man at his entrance into\r\nlife, who, impelled by an almost irresistible desire to devote himself\r\nto the abstruser sciences, or who, confident in the energy of youthful\r\npower, feels that the career of science is that in which his mental\r\nfaculties are most fitted to achieve the reputation for which he pants.\r\nWhat are his prospects? Can even the glowing pencil of enthusiasm add\r\ncolour to the blank before him? There are no situations in the state;\r\nthere is no position in society to which hope can point, to cheer him\r\nin his laborious path. If, indeed, he belong to one of our universities,\r\nthere are some few chairs in his OWN Alma Mater to which he may at some\r\ndistant day pretend; but these are not numerous; and whilst the salaries\r\nattached are seldom sufficient for the sole support of the individual,\r\nthey are very rarely enough for that of a family. What then can he reply\r\nto the entreaties of his friends, to betake himself to some business\r\nin which perhaps they have power to assist him, or to choose some\r\nprofession in which his talents may produce for him their fair reward?\r\nIf he have no fortune, the choice is taken away: he MUST give up that\r\nline of life in which his habits of thought and his ambition qualify\r\nhim to succeed eminently, and he MUST choose the bar, or some other\r\nprofession, in which, amongst so many competitors, in spite of his great\r\ntalents, he can be but moderately successful. The loss to him is\r\ngreat, but to the country it is greater. We thus, by a destructive\r\nmisapplication of talent which our institutions create, exchange a\r\nprofound philosopher for but a tolerable lawyer.\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, he possess some moderate fortune of his own; and,\r\nintent on the glory of an immortal name, yet not blindly ignorant of the\r\nstate of science in this country, he resolve to make for that aspiration\r\na sacrifice the greater, because he is fully aware of its extent;--if,\r\nso circumstanced, he give up a business or a profession on which he\r\nmight have entered with advantage, with the hope that, when he shall\r\nhave won a station high in the ranks of European science, he may a\r\nlittle augment his resources by some of those few employments to which\r\nscience leads;--if he hope to obtain some situation, (at the Board of\r\nLongitude, for example,) [This body is now dissolved] where he may\r\nbe permitted to exercise the talents of a philosopher for the paltry\r\nremuneration of a clerk, he will find that other qualifications than\r\nknowledge and a love of science are necessary for its attainment. He\r\nwill also find that the high and independent spirit, which usually\r\ndwells in the breast of those who are deeply versed in these pursuits,\r\nis ill adapted for such appointments; and that even if successful, he\r\nmust hear many things he disapproves, and raise no voice AGAINST them.\r\n\r\nThus, then, it appears that scarcely any man can be expected to pursue\r\nabstract science unless he possess a private fortune, and unless he\r\ncan resolve to give up all intention of improving it. Yet, how few thus\r\nsituated are likely to undergo the labour of the acquisition; and if\r\nthey do from some irresistible impulse, what inducement is there for\r\nthem to deviate one step from those inquiries in which they find the\r\ngreatest delight, into those which might be more immediately useful to\r\nthe public?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III. GENERAL STATE OF LEARNED SOCIETIES IN ENGLAND.\r\n\r\nThe progress of knowledge convinced the world that the system of the\r\ndivision of labour and of cooperation was as applicable to science, as\r\nit had been found available for the improvement of manufactures. The\r\nwant of competition in science produced effects similar to those which\r\nthe same cause gives birth to in the arts. The cultivators of botany\r\nwere the first to feel that the range of knowledge embraced by the Royal\r\nSociety was too comprehensive to admit of sufficient attention to their\r\nfavourite subject, and they established the Linnean Society. After many\r\nyears, a new science arose, and the Geological Society was produced. At\r\nan another and more recent epoch, the friends of astronomy, urged by the\r\nwants of their science, united to establish the Astronomical Society.\r\nEach of these bodies found, that the attention devoted to their science\r\nby the parent establishment was insufficient for their wants, and each\r\nin succession experienced from the Royal Society the most determined\r\nopposition.\r\n\r\nInstituted by the most enlightened philosophers, solely for the\r\npromotion of the natural sciences, that learned body justly conceived\r\nthat nothing could be more likely to render these young institutions\r\npermanently successful, than discouragement and opposition at their\r\ncommencement. Finding their first attempts so eminently successful,\r\nthey redoubled the severity of their persecution, and the result was\r\ncommensurate with their exertions, and surpassed even their wildest\r\nanticipations. The Astronomical Society became in six years known and\r\nrespected throughout Europe, not from the halo of reputation which\r\nthe glory of its vigourous youth had thrown around the weakness of its\r\ndeclining years; but from the sterling merit of \"its unpretending\r\ndeeds, from the sympathy it claimed and received from every practical\r\nastronomer, whose labours it relieved, and whose calculations it\r\nlightened.\"\r\n\r\nBut the system which worked so well is now changed, and the Zoological\r\nand Medico-Botanical Societies were established without opposition:\r\nperhaps, indeed, the total failure of the latter society is the best\r\nproof of the wisdom which guided the councils of the Royal. At present,\r\nthe various societies exist with no feelings of rivalry or hostility,\r\neach pursuing its separate objects, and all uniting in deploring with\r\nfilial regret, the second childhood of their common parent, and the evil\r\ncouncils by which that sad event has been anticipated.\r\n\r\nIt is the custom to attach certain letters to the names of those who\r\nbelong to different societies, and these marks of ownership are by\r\nmany considered the only valuable part of their purchase on entry. The\r\nfollowing is a list of some of these societies. The second column gives\r\nthe ready-money prices of the tail-pieces indicated in the third.\r\n\r\n\r\n     SOCIETIES.

It is\r\nindeed creditable to us, that the greater part of these societies are\r\nmaintained by the voluntary contributions of their members. But, unless\r\nthe inquiries which have recently taken place in some of them should\r\nrectify the SYSTEM OF MANAGEMENT by which several have been oppressed,\r\nit is not difficult to predict that their duration will be short. Full\r\nPUBLICITY, PRINTED STATEMENTS OF ACCOUNTS, and occasional DISCUSSIONS\r\nand inquiries at GENERAL MEETINGS, are the only safeguards; and a due\r\ndegree of VIGILANCE should be exercised on those who DISCOURAGE these\r\nprinciples. Of the Royal Society, I shall speak in a succeeding page;\r\nand I regret to add, that I might have said more. My object is to amend\r\nit; but, like all deeply-rooted complaints, the operation which alone\r\ncan contribute to its cure, is necessarily painful. Had the words of\r\nremonstrance or reproof found utterance through other channels, I had\r\ngladly been silent, content to support by my vote the reasonings of the\r\nfriend of science and of the Society. But this has not been the case,\r\nand after frustrated efforts to introduce improvements, I shall now\r\nendeavour, by the force of plain, but perhaps painful truths, to direct\r\npublic opinion in calling for such a reform, as shall rescue the Royal\r\nSociety from contempt in our own country, from ridicule in others.\r\n\r\nOn the next five societies in the list, I shall offer no remarks. Of the\r\nGeological, I shall say a few words. It possesses all the freshness, the\r\nvigour, and the ardour of youth in the pursuit of a youthful science,\r\nand has succeeded in a most difficult experiment, that of having an oral\r\ndiscussion on the subject of each paper read at its meetings. To say of\r\nthese discussions, that they are very entertaining, is the least part\r\nof the praise which is due to them. They are generally very instructive,\r\nand sometimes bring together isolated facts in the science which,\r\nthough insignificant when separate, mutually illustrate each other,\r\nand ultimately lead to important conclusions. The continuance of these\r\ndiscussions evidently depends on the taste, the temper, and the good\r\nsense of the speakers. The things to be avoided are chiefly verbal\r\ncriticisms--praise of each other beyond its reasonable limits, and\r\ncontest for victory. This latter is, perhaps, the most important of the\r\nthree, both for the interests of the Society and of truth. With regard\r\nto the published volumes of their Transactions, it may be remarked,\r\nthat if members were in the habit of communicating their papers to the\r\nSociety in a more finished state, it would be attended with several\r\nadvantages; amongst others, with that of lightening the heavy duties of\r\nthe officers, which are perhaps more laborious in this Society than in\r\nmost others. To court publicity in their accounts and proceedings,\r\nand to endeavour to represent all the feelings of the Society in the\r\nCouncil, and to avoid permanent Presidents, is a recommendation not\r\npeculiarly addressed to this Society, but would contribute to the\r\nwell-being of all.\r\n\r\nOf the Astronomical Society, which, from the nature of its pursuits,\r\ncould scarcely admit of the discussions similar to those of the\r\nGeological, I shall merely observe, that I know of no secret which has\r\ncaused its great success, unless it be attention to the maxims which\r\nhave just been stated.\r\n\r\nOn the Zoological Society, which affords much rational amusement to the\r\npublic, a few hints may at present suffice. The largeness of its income\r\nis a frightful consideration. It is too tempting as the subject for\r\njobs, and it is too fluctuating and uncertain in its amount, not to\r\nrender embarrassment in the affairs of the Society a circumstance likely\r\nto occur, without the greatest circumspection. It is most probable, from\r\nthe very recent formation of this Institution, that its Officers and\r\nCouncil are at present all that its best friends could wish; but it\r\nis still right to mention, that in such a Society, it is essentially\r\nnecessary to have men of business on the Council, as well as persons\r\npossessing extensive knowledge of its pursuits. It is more dangerous\r\nin such a Society than in any other, to pay compliments, by placing\r\ngentlemen on the Council who have not the qualifications which are\r\nrequisite; a frequent change in the members of the Council is desirable,\r\nin order to find out who are the most regular attendants, and most\r\nqualified to conduct its business. Publicity in its accounts and\r\nproceedings is, from the magnitude of its funds, more essential to the\r\nZoological than to any other society; and it is rather a fearful omen,\r\nthat a check was attempted to be given to such inquiries at the last\r\nanniversary meeting. If it is to be a scientific body, the friends of\r\nscience should not for an instant tolerate such attempts.\r\n\r\nIt frequently happens, that gentlemen take an active part in more\r\nthan one scientific society: in that case, it may be useful to derive\r\ninstruction as to their merits, by observing the success of their\r\nmeasures in other societies.\r\n\r\nThe Asiatic Society has, amongst other benefits, caused many valuable\r\nworks to be translated, which could not have otherwise been published.\r\n\r\nThe Horticultural Society has been ridden almost to death, and is\r\nnow rousing itself; but its constitution seems to have been somewhat\r\nimpaired. There are hopes of its purgation, and ultimate restoration,\r\nnotwithstanding a debt of 19,000L., which the Committee of Inquiry have\r\nascertained to exist. This, after all, will not be without its advantage\r\nto science, if it puts a stop to HOUSE-LISTS, NAMED BY ONE OR TWO\r\nPERSONS,--to making COMPLIMENTARY councillors,--and to auditing the\r\naccounts WITHOUT EXAMINING EVERY ITEM, or to omitting even that form\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\nThe Medico-Botanical Society suddenly claimed the attention of the\r\npublic; its pretensions were great--its assurance unbounded. It speedily\r\nbecame distinguished, not by its publications or discoveries, but by the\r\nnumber of princes it enrolled in its list. It is needless now to expose\r\nthe extent of its short-lived quackery; but the evil deeds of that\r\ninstitution will long remain in the impression they have contributed\r\nto confirm throughout Europe, of the character of our scientific\r\nestablishments. It would be at once a judicious and a dignified course,\r\nif those lovers of science, who have been so grievously deceived in this\r\nSociety, were to enrol upon the latest page of its history its highest\r\nclaim to public approbation, and by signing its dissolution, offer the\r\nonly atonement in their power to the insulted science of their country.\r\nAs with a singular inversion of principle, the society contrived to\r\nrender EXPULSION* the highest HONOUR it could confer; so it remains\r\nfor it to exemplify, in suicide, the sublimest virtue of which it is\r\ncapable. [* They expelled from amongst them a gentleman, of whom it is\r\nbut slight praise to say, that he is the first and most philosophical\r\nbotanist of our own country, and who is admired abroad as he is\r\nrespected at home. The circumstance which surprised the world was not\r\nhis exit from, but his previous entrance into that Society.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV. STATE OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY IN PARTICULAR.\r\n\r\nAs the venerable first parent of English, and I might perhaps say, of\r\nEuropean scientific societies; as a body in the welfare of which, in\r\nthe opinions of many, the interests of British science are materially\r\ninvolved, I may be permitted to feel anxiously, and to speak more in\r\ndetail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION 1. MODE OF BECOMING A FELLOW OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY.\r\n\r\nI have no intention of stating what ought to be the qualifications of\r\na Fellow of the Royal Society; but, for years, the practical mode of\r\narriving at that honour, has been as follows:--\r\n\r\nA. B. gets any three Fellows to sign a certificate, stating that he\r\n(A. B.) is desirous of becoming a member, and likely to be a useful and\r\nvaluable one. This is handed in to the Secretary, and suspended in the\r\nmeeting-room. At the end of ten weeks, if A. B. has the good fortune to\r\nbe perfectly unknown by any literary or scientific achievement, however\r\nsmall, he is quite sure of being elected as a matter of course. If, on\r\nthe other hand, he has unfortunately written on any subject connected\r\nwith science, or is supposed to be acquainted with any branch of it, the\r\nmembers begin to inquire what he has done to deserve the honour;\r\nand, unless he has powerful friends, he has a fair chance of being\r\nblack-balled. [I understand that certificates are now read at the\r\nCouncil, previously to their being hung up in the meeting-room; but I am\r\nnot aware that this has in the slightest degree diminished their number,\r\nwhich was, at the time of writing this note, TWENTY-FOUR.]\r\n\r\nIn fourteen years' experience, the few whom I have seen rejected,\r\nhave all been known persons; but even in such cases a hope\r\nremains;--perseverance will do much, and a gentleman who values so\r\nhighly the distinction of admission to the Royal Society, may try\r\nagain; and even after being twice black-balled, if he will a third time\r\ncondescend to express his desire to become a member, he may perhaps\r\nsucceed, by the aid of a hard canvass. In such circumstances, the odds\r\nare much in favour of the candidate possessing great scientific claims;\r\nand the only objection that could then reasonably be suggested, would\r\narise from his estimating rather too highly a distinction which had\r\nbecome insignificant from its unlimited extension.\r\n\r\nIt should be observed, that all members contribute equally, and that\r\nthe sum now required is fifty pounds. It used, until lately, to be\r\nten pounds on entrance, and four pounds annually. The amount of this\r\nsubscription is so large, that it is calculated to prevent many men\r\nof real science from entering the Society, and is a very severe tax on\r\nthose who do so; for very few indeed of the cultivators of science\r\nrank amongst the wealthy classes. Several times, whilst I have been\r\nconsulting books or papers at Somerset House, persons have called to\r\nask the Assistant-secretary the mode of becoming a member of the Royal\r\nSociety. I should conjecture, from some of these applications, that it\r\nis not very unusual for gentlemen in the country to order their agents\r\nin London to take measures for putting them up at the Royal Society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION 2. OF THE PRESIDENCY AND VICE-PRESIDENCIES.\r\n\r\nWhy Mr. Davies Gilbert became President of the Royal Society I cannot\r\nprecisely say. Let him who penned, and those who supported this\r\nresolution solve the enigma:\r\n\r\n\"It was Resolved,\r\n\r\n\"That it is the opinion of the Council that Davies Gilbert, Esq. is by\r\nfar the most fit person to be proposed to the Society at the approaching\r\nanniversary as President, and that he be recommended accordingly.\"\r\n\r\nTo resolve that he was a FIT person might have been sufficiently\r\nflattering: to state that he was the most fit, was a little hard upon\r\nthe rest of the Society; but to resolve that he was \"BY FAR THE MOST\r\nFIT\" was only consistent with that strain of compliment in which his\r\nsupporters indulge, and was a eulogy, by no means unique in its kind, I\r\nbelieve, even at that very Council.\r\n\r\nThat Mr. Gilbert is a most amiable and kind-hearted man will be\r\ninstantly admitted by all who are, in the least degree, acquainted with\r\nhim: that he is fit for the chair of the Royal Society, will be allowed\r\nby few, except those who have committed themselves to the above-quoted\r\nresolution.\r\n\r\nPossessed of knowledge and of fortune more than sufficient for it, he\r\nmight have been the restorer of its lustre. He might have called round\r\nhim, at the council board, those most actively engaged in the pursuits\r\nof science, most anxious for the improvement of the Royal Society.\r\nInstead of himself proposing resolutions, he might have been, what a\r\nchairman ought to be, the organ of the body over which he presides. By\r\nthe firmness of his own conduct he might have taught the subordinate\r\nofficers of the Society the duties of their station. Instead of paying\r\ncompliments to Ministers, who must have smiled at his simplicity, he\r\nmight have maintained the dignity of his Council by the dignity of\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\nBut he has chosen a different path; with no motives of interest\r\nto allure, or of ambition to betray him, instead of making himself\r\nrespected as the powerful chief of a united republic,--that of\r\nscience,--he has grasped at despotic power, and stands the feeble\r\noccupant of its desolated kingdom, trembling at the force of opinions\r\nhe might have directed, and refused even the patronage of their names by\r\nthose whose energies he might have commanded.\r\n\r\nMr. Gilbert told the Society he accepted the situation for a year; and\r\nthis circumstance caused a difficulty in finding a Treasurer: an office\r\nwhich he had long held, and to which he wished to return.\r\n\r\nAnother difficulty might have arisen, from the fact of the late Board\r\nof Longitude comprising amongst its Members the PRESIDENT of the Royal\r\nSociety, and three of its Fellows, appointed by the President and\r\nCouncil. Of course, when Mr. Gilbert accepted the higher situation, he\r\nbecame, EX OFFICIO, a Member of the Board of Longitude; and a vacancy\r\noccurred, which ought to have been filled up by the President and\r\nCouncil. But when this subject was brought before them, in defiance of\r\ncommon sense, and the plain meaning of the act of parliament, which had\r\nenacted that the Board of Longitude should have the assistance of four\r\npersons belonging to the Royal Society, Mr. Gilbert refused to allow\r\nit to be filled up, on the ground that he should not be President next\r\nyear, and had made no vacancy.\r\n\r\nNext year Mr. Gilbert wished again to be President one other year; but\r\nthe Board of Longitude was dissolved, otherwise we might have had some\r\nLOCUM TENENS to retire at Mr. Gilbert's pleasure.\r\n\r\nThese circumstances are in themselves of trifling importance, but they\r\nillustrate the character of the proceedings: and it is not becoming\r\nthe dignity of science or of the Society that its officers should be so\r\ncircumstanced as to have an apparent and direct interest in supporting\r\nthe existing President, in order to retain their own places; and if\r\nsuch a system is once discovered, doubt immediately arises as to the\r\nfrequency of such arrangements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION 3. OF THE SECRETARISHIPS.\r\n\r\nWhether the present Secretaries are the best qualified to aid in\r\nreforming the Society, is a question I shall not discuss. With regard\r\nto the senior Secretary, the time of his holding office is perhaps more\r\nunfortunate than the circumstance. If I might be permitted to allude\r\nfor a moment to his personal character, I should say that the mild\r\nexcellencies of his heart have prevented the Royal Society from deriving\r\nthe whole of that advantage from his varied knowledge and liberal\r\nsentiments which some might perhaps have anticipated; and many will\r\nagree with me in regretting that his judgment has not directed a larger\r\nportion of the past deeds of the Councils of the Royal Society. Of the\r\njunior Secretary I shall only observe, that whilst I admit his industry,\r\nhis perseverance, and his talents, I regret to see such valuable\r\nqualities exerted at a disadvantage, and that I sincerely wish them\r\nall the success they merit in situations more adapted for their\r\ndevelopement.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, some general principles which it may be important to\r\ninvestigate, which relate to the future as well as to the past state of\r\nthe office of Secretary of the Royal Society. Inconvenience has already\r\narisen from having had at a former period one of our Secretaries the\r\nconductor of a scientific journal; and this is one of the points in\r\nwhich I can agree with those who now manage the affairs of the Society.\r\n[These observations were written previous to the late appointment, to\r\nwhich I now devote Section 6. Experience seems to be lost on the Council\r\nof the Royal Society.] Perhaps it might be advantageous to extend the\r\nsame understanding to the other officers of the Society at least, if not\r\nto the members of its Council.\r\n\r\nAnother circumstance worthy of the attention of the Society is, to\r\nconsider whether it is desirable, except in special cases, to have\r\nmilitary persons appointed to any of its offices. There are several\r\npeculiarities in the military character, which, though they do not\r\nabsolutely unfit their possessors for the individual prosecution of\r\nscience, may in some degree disqualify such persons from holding offices\r\nin scientific institutions. The habits both of obedience and command,\r\nwhich are essential in military life, are little fitted for that perfect\r\nfreedom which should reign in the councils of science. If a military\r\nchief commit an oversight or an error, it is necessary, in order to\r\nretain the confidence of those he commands, to conceal or mask it as\r\nmuch as possible. If an experimentalist make a mistake, his only course\r\nto win the confidence of his fellow-labourers in science, and to render\r\nhis future observations of any use, is to acknowledge it in the most\r\nfull and explicit manner. The very qualifications which contribute to\r\nthe professional excellence of the soldier, constitute his defects when\r\nhe enters the paths of science; and it is only in those rare cases where\r\nthe force of genius is able to control and surmount these habits,\r\nthat his admission to the offices of science can be attended with any\r\nadvantage to it.\r\n\r\nAnother objection deserving notice, although not applying exclusively to\r\nthe military profession, is, that persons not imbued with the feelings\r\nof men of science, when they have published their observations, are too\r\napt to view every criticism upon them as a personal question, and\r\nto consider that it is as offensive to doubt the accuracy of their\r\nobservations as it is to doubt their word. Nothing can be more injurious\r\nto science than that such an opinion should be tolerated. The most\r\nunreserved criticism is necessary for truth; and those suspicions\r\nrespecting his own accuracy, which every philosophical experimenter will\r\nentertain concerning his own researches, ought never to be considered as\r\na reproach, when they are kept in view in examining the experiments of\r\nothers. The minute circumstances and apparently trivial causes which\r\nlend their influence towards error, even in persons of the most candid\r\njudgment, are amongst the most curious phenomena of the human mind.\r\n\r\nThe importance of affording every aid to enable others to try the merits\r\nof observations, has been so well expressed by Mayer, that I shall\r\nconclude these remarks with an extract from the Preface to his\r\nObservations:\r\n\r\n\"Officii enim cujusque observatoris ease reor, de habitu instrumenti\r\nsui, de cura ac precautione, qua usus est, ad illud recte tractandum,\r\ndeque mediis in errores ejus inquirendi rationem reddere publice, ut\r\naliis quoque copia sit judicandi, quanta fides habenda conclusionibus ex\r\nnostris observationibus deductis aut deducendis. Hoc cum minus fecissent\r\nprecedentis saeculi astronomi, praxin nimis secure, nimisque theoretice\r\ntractantes, factum inde potissimum est, ut illorum observationes tot\r\nvigiliis tantoque labore comparatae tam cito obsoleverint.\" P. viii.\r\n\r\nThere are certain duties which the Royal Society owes to its own\r\ncharacter as well as to the public, which, having been on some occasions\r\napparently neglected, it may be here the proper place to mention,\r\nsince it is reasonable to suppose that attention to them is within the\r\nprovince of its Secretaries.\r\n\r\nThe first to which I shall allude is the singular circumstances\r\nattending the fact of the Royal Society having printed a volume\r\nof Astronomical Observations which were made at the Observatory of\r\nParamatta (New South Wales), bearing the title of \"The Third Part of the\r\nPhilosophical Transactions for the Year 1829.\"\r\n\r\nNow this Observatory was founded at the private expense of a British\r\nofficer; the instruments were paid for out of his purse; two observers\r\nwere brought from Europe, to be employed in making use of those\r\ninstruments, at salaries defrayed by him. A considerable portion of\r\nthe observations so printed were made by these astronomers during their\r\nemployment in his service, and some of them are personally his own. Yet\r\nhas the Royal Society, in adopting them as part of its Transactions,\r\nomitted all mention, either in their title-page, preface, or in any\r\npart of the volume, of the FACT that the world owed these valuable\r\nobservations to the enlightened munificence of Lieutenant-General Sir\r\nThomas Brisbane; whose ardent zeal in the pursuit of science induced him\r\nto found, at his own private expense, an establishment which it has\r\nbeen creditable to the British Government to continue as a national\r\ninstitution. Had any kindred feelings existed in the Council, instead\r\nof endeavouring to shift the responsibility, they would have hastened to\r\nrectify an omission, less unjust to the individual than it was injurious\r\nto English science.\r\n\r\nAnother topic, which concerns most vitally the character and integrity\r\nof the Royal Society, I hardly know how to approach. It has been\r\npublicly stated that confidence cannot be placed in the written minutes\r\nof the Society; and an instance has been adduced, in which an entry\r\nhas been asserted to have been made, which could not have been the true\r\nstatement of what actually passed at the Council.\r\n\r\nThe facts on which the specific instance rests are not difficult to\r\nverify by members of the Royal Society. I have examined them, and shall\r\nstate them before I enter on the reasoning which may be founded upon\r\nthem. In the minutes of the Council, 26th November, 1829, we find--\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, that the following gentlemen be recommended to be put upon\r\nthe Council for the ensuing year.\" [Here follows a list of persons,\r\namongst whom the name of Sir John Franklin occurs [Sir John Franklin was\r\nabsent from London, and altogether unacquainted with this transaction,\r\nuntil he saw it stated in the newspapers some months after it had\r\ntaken place. That his name was the one substituted for that of Captain\r\nBeaufort I know, from other evidence which need not be produced here, as\r\nthe omission of the latter name is the charge that has been made.],\r\nand that of Captain Beaufort is not found. [Any gentleman may satisfy\r\nhimself that this is not a mistake of the Assistant Secretary's, in\r\ncopying, by consulting the rough minutes of that meeting of the Council,\r\nwhich it might perhaps be as well to write in a rough minute-book,\r\ninstead of upon loose sheets of paper; nor can it be attributed to any\r\nerror arising from accidentally mislaying the real minutes, for in that\r\ncase the error would have been rectified immediately it was detected;\r\nand this has remained uncorrected, although publicly spoken of for\r\nmonths. As there is no erasure in the list, one is reluctantly\r\ncompelled to conjecture that the real minutes of that meeting have been\r\ndestroyed.]]\r\n\r\nNow this could not be the list actually recommended by the Council on\r\nthe morning of the 26th of November, because the President himself, on\r\nthe evening of that day, informed Capt. Beaufort that he was placed on\r\nthe house list; and that officer, with the characteristic openness of\r\nhis profession, wrote on the next or the following day to the President,\r\ndeclining that situation, and stating his reasons for the step.\r\n\r\nUpon the fact, therefore, of the suppression of part of a resolution\r\nof the Council, on the 26th of November, there can be no doubt; but\r\nin order to understand the whole nature of the transaction, other\r\ninformation is necessary. It has been the wish of many members of the\r\nSociety, that the President should not absolutely name his own Council,\r\nbut that the subject should be discussed fairly at the meeting previous\r\nto the Anniversary--this has always been opposed by Mr. Gilbert, and\r\nthose who support him. Now, it has been stated, that, at the meeting\r\nof the Council on the 26th of November, the President took out of his\r\npocket a bit of paper, from which he read the names of several persons\r\nas fit to be on the Council for the ensuing year;--that it was not\r\nunderstood that any motion was made, and it is certain that none was\r\nseconded, nor was any ballot taken on such an important question; and\r\nit was a matter of considerable surprise to some of those present, to\r\ndiscover afterwards that it was entered on the minutes as a resolution.\r\nThis statement I have endeavoured to verify, and I believe it to be\r\nsubstantially correct; if it was a resolution, it was dictated, not\r\ndiscussed. It is also important to observe, that no similar resolution\r\nstands on the council-books for any previous year.\r\n\r\nOn examining the minutes of the succeeding Council, no notice of\r\nthe letter of Captain Beaufort to the President is found. Why was it\r\nomitted? If the first entry had been truly made, there would have been\r\nno necessity for the omission; and after the insertion of that letter,\r\na resolution would naturally have followed, recommending another name\r\ninstead of the one withdrawn. Such was the natural and open course; but\r\nthis would have exposed to the Society the weakness of those who manage\r\nit. If the rough minutes of each meeting of the Council were read over\r\nbefore it separated, and were copied previously to the next meeting,\r\nsuch a substitution could hardly have occurred; but, unfortunately, this\r\nis not the case, and the delay is in some cases considerable. Thus, the\r\nminutes of the three Councils, held on February 4, on February 11, and\r\non March 11, were not entered on the minute-books of the Council\r\non Tuesday, the 16th March; nor was this the fault of the\r\nAssistant-secretary, for up to that day the rough minutes of no one of\r\nthose Councils had been transmitted to him.\r\n\r\nDeeply as every friend to the Royal Society must regret such an\r\noccurrence, one slight advantage may accrue. Should that resolution be\r\never quoted hereafter to prove that the Council of 1829 really discussed\r\nthe persons to be recommended as their successors, the detection of\r\nthis suppression of one portion of it, will furnish better means of\r\nestimating the confidence due to the whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION 4. OF THE SCIENTIFIC ADVISERS.\r\n\r\nWhether it was feared by the PARTY who govern the Royal Society,\r\nthat its Council would not be sufficiently tractable, or whether the\r\nAdmiralty determined to render that body completely subservient to them,\r\nor whether both these motives concurred, I know not; but, low as has\r\nbeen for years its character for independence, and fallen as the Royal\r\nSociety is in public estimation, it could scarcely be prepared for\r\nthis last insult. In order to inform the public and the Society, (for I\r\nbelieve the fact is known to few of the members,) it will be necessary\r\nto trace the history of those circumstances which led to the institution\r\nof the offices of Scientific Advisers, from the time of the existence of\r\nthe late Board of Longitude.\r\n\r\nThat body consisted, according to the act of parliament which\r\nestablished it, of certain official members, who usually possessed no\r\nknowledge of the subjects it was the duty of the Board to discuss--of\r\ncertain professors of the two universities, and the Astronomer Royal,\r\nwho had some knowledge, and who were paid 100L. a year for their\r\nattendance;--of three honorary members of the Royal Society, who\r\ncombined the qualifications of the two preceding classes; and, lastly,\r\nof \"three other persons,\" named Resident Commissioners, who were\r\nsupposed to be \"WELL VERSED IN THE SCIENCES OF MATHEMATICS, ASTRONOMY,\r\nOR NAVIGATION,\" and who were paid a hundred a year to do the work of the\r\nBoard.\r\n\r\nThe first three classes were permanent members, but the \"three other\r\npersons\" only held the appointment for ONE YEAR, and were renewable at\r\nthe pleasure of the Admiralty. This Board was abolished by another act\r\nof parliament, on the ground that it was useless. Shortly after, the\r\nSecretary of the Admiralty communicated to the Council of the Royal\r\nSociety, the copy of an Order in Council:\r\n\r\nADMIRALTY OFFICE,\r\n\r\nNovember 1, 1828.\r\n\r\nSIR, I am commanded by my Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, to send\r\nherewith, for the information of the President and Council of the Royal\r\nSociety, a copy of His Majesty's Order in Council of the 27th of last\r\nmonth; explaining that the salaries heretofore allowed to the Resident\r\nCommissioners of the Board of Longitude, and to the Superintendents of\r\nthe Nautical Almanac, and of Chronometers, shall be continued to them,\r\nnotwithstanding the abolition of the Board of Longitude. And I am to\r\nacquaint you, that the necessary orders have been given to the Navy\r\nBoard for the payment of the said salaries.\r\n\r\nI am, Sir,\r\n\r\nYour most obedient humble servant,\r\n\r\nJOHN BARROW.\r\n\r\n\r\nAT THE COURT AT WINDSOR,\r\n\r\n27th October, 1828.\r\n\r\nPRESENT,\r\n\r\nThe King's most Excellent Majesty in Council,\r\n\r\nWhereas, there was this day read at the Board a Memorial from the Right\r\nHonourable the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, dated 4th of this\r\ninstant, in the words following, viz.--\r\n\r\nWhereas, by an Act of the 58th of his late Majesty's reign, cap. 20,\r\ninstituted \"An Act for the more effectually discovering the Longitude\r\nat sea, and encouraging attempts to find a Northern passage between\r\nthe Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, and to approach the North Pole,\"\r\nthree persons well versed in the sciences of Mathematics, Astronomy,\r\nor Navigation, were appointed as a Resident Committee of the Board\r\nof Commissioners for discovery of the Longitude at sea, and a\r\nSuperintendent of the Nautical Almanac and of Chronometers was also\r\nappointed, with such salaries for the execution of those services as\r\nhis Majesty might, by any Order in Council, be pleased to direct; and,\r\nwhereas, your Majesty was in consequence, by your Order in Council of\r\nthe 27th of May, 1828, most graciously pleased to direct, that the three\r\nsaid Resident Commissioners should be paid at the rate of 100L. a year\r\neach; and by your further Order in Council, of the 31st October, 1818,\r\nthat the Superintendent of the Nautical Almanac should be allowed a\r\nsalary of 300L., and the Superintendent of Chronometers 100L. a year;\r\nand, whereas, the act above mentioned has been repealed, and the Board\r\nof Longitude abolished; and doubts have therefore arisen, whether the\r\nsaid Orders in Council shall still continue in force; and whereas it\r\nis expedient that the said appointments be continued; We beg leave most\r\nhumbly to submit to your Majesty, that your Majesty may be graciously\r\npleased, by your Order in Council, to direct that the said offices\r\nof Superintendent of the Nautical Almanac, and of Superintendent of\r\nChronometers; and also the three persons before-mentioned as a Resident\r\nCommittee, to advise with the Commissioners for executing the Office\r\nof Lord High Admiral, on all questions of discoveries, inventions,\r\ncalculations, and other scientific subjects, be continued, with the same\r\nduties and salaries, and under the same regulations as heretofore; and\r\nfurther beg most humbly to propose, that such three persons to form\r\nthe Resident Committee, be chosen annually by the Commissioners for\r\nexecuting the office of Lord High Admiral, from among the Council of the\r\nRoyal Society.\r\n\r\nHis Majesty, having taken the said Memorial into consideration, was\r\npleased, by and with the advice of his Privy Council, to approve thereof\r\nand the Right Honourable the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty are to\r\ngive the necessary directions herein accordingly.\r\n\r\n(Signed) JAMES HILLER.\r\n\r\nThus, it appeared that the Admiralty were to choose three persons from\r\namong the Council of the Royal Society, who were to have a hundred a\r\nyear each during the pleasure of the Admiralty.\r\n\r\nSuch an open attack on the independence of the Council could not escape\r\nthe remarks of some of the members, and a kind of mild remonstrance was\r\nmade, in which the real ground of complaint was omitted.\r\n\r\nMINUTE OF COUNCIL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY. December 18, 1823.\r\n\r\nRESOLVED, That in acknowledging the communication of the Lords\r\nCommissioners of the Admiralty, made to the Council of the Royal\r\nSociety, on the 20th of November last, it be represented to them that\r\ninconvenience may arise from the plan therein specified, from the\r\ncircumstance of all the members of the Council being annually elected\r\nby the Society at large; and that body being consequently subject to\r\ncontinual changes from year to year.\r\n\r\nThis was answered by the following letter from the Secretary of the\r\nAdmiralty:\r\n\r\nADMIRALTY OFFICE, DEC. 30, 1828.\r\n\r\nSIR, Having submitted to my Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty your\r\nLetter of the 18th instant, subjoining an extract from the Minutes of\r\nthe proceedings of the Council of the Royal Society, arising out of the\r\ncommunication made to them by their Lordships, on the subject of his\r\nMajesty's Order in Council, of the fifth of October last, I have their\r\nLordships' command to acquaint you, for the information of the President\r\nand Council, and with reference to what they have stated as to the\r\ninconvenience which may arise from the intended plan of limiting their\r\nLordships' choice of members of the Resident Committee of Scientific\r\nAdvice to the Council of the Royal Society, that their Lordships were\r\ninduced to recommend this plan to his Majesty as a mark of respect to\r\nthe Society, and as a pledge to the public of the qualification of the\r\npersons chosen. Nor did their Lordships apprehend any inconvenience from\r\nthe circumstance stated in the Minute of the Council, of the Members\r\nbeing annually elected, as the Resident Committee is also annually\r\nappointed; and, in point of fact, no practical inconvenience has been\r\nfelt during the ten years that the Committee has been in existence,\r\nas four of the distinguished gentlemen whom their Lordships have\r\nsuccessively appointed to this office, have continued during the whole\r\nperiod to be members of the Council; and if any such difficulty or\r\ninconvenience should hereafter arise, their Lordships will be ready to\r\ntake proper measures for remedying it.\r\n\r\nTheir Lordships' intention therefore is, to propose to Captain Kater and\r\nMr. Herschel, to continue to fill this office; and to Dr. Young, who had\r\nresigned it, on receiving the appointment of Secretary to the late Board\r\nof Longitude, to be appointed.\r\n\r\nI am, Sir, Your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nJOHN BARROW.\r\n\r\nThe representation made by the Council was not calculated to produce\r\nmuch effect; but the Secretary of the Admiralty, who knew well the stuff\r\nof which Councils of the Royal Society are composed, might have spared\r\nthe bitter irony of making their Lordships say, that they recommended\r\nthis plan \"AS A MARK OF RESPECT TO THE SOCIETY,\" and \"AS A PLEDGE TO\r\nTHE PUBLIC OF THE QUALIFICATIONS OF THE PERSONS CHOSEN,\" whilst he\r\ndelicately hints to them their dependent situation, by observing, that\r\nthe \"RESIDENT COMMITTEE IS ALSO ANNUALLY APPOINTED.\"\r\n\r\nThe Secretary knew that, PRACTICALLY speaking, it had been the custom\r\nfor years for the President of the Royal Society to nominate the\r\nCouncil, and consequently he knew that every scientific adviser must\r\nfirst be indebted to the President for being qualified to advise, and\r\nthen to the Admiralty for deriving profit from his counsel. Thus then\r\ntheir Lordships, as a \"MARK OF RESPECT FOR THE SOCIETY\" confirm the\r\ndependence of the Council on the President, by making his nomination\r\na qualification for place, and establish a new dependence of the same\r\nCouncil on themselves, by giving a hundred pounds each year to such\r\nthree members of that Council as they may select. \"THE PLEDGE\" they\r\noffer \"TO THE PUBLIC, OF THE QUALIFICATIONS OF THE PERSONS CHOSEN,\" is,\r\nthat Mr. Davies Gilbert had previously thought they would do for his\r\nCouncil.\r\n\r\nWhat the Society, when they are acquainted with it, may think of this\r\nmark of respect, or what value the public may put upon this pledge, must\r\nbe left to themselves to express.\r\n\r\nIn looking over the list of officers and Council of the Royal Society\r\nthe weakest perhaps (for purposes of science) which was ever made, a\r\nconsolation arises from the possibility of some of those who were placed\r\nthere by way of compliment, occasionally attending. In that contracted\r\nfield Lord Melville's penetration may not be uselessly employed; and the\r\nsoldier who presides over our colonies may judge whether the principles\r\nwhich pervade it are open and liberal as his own.\r\n\r\nThe inconvenience to the public service from such an arrangement is,\r\nthat the number out of which the advisers are selected must, in\r\nany case, be very small; and may, from several circumstances, be\r\nconsiderably reduced. In a council fairly selected, to judge of\r\nthe merits of the various subjects likely to be brought under the\r\nconsideration of the Society, anatomy, chemistry, and the different\r\nbranches of natural history, will share with the numerous departments of\r\nphysical science, in claiming to be represented by persons competently\r\nskilled in those subjects. These claims being satisfied, but few places\r\nwill be left to fill up with mathematicians, astronomers, and persons\r\nconversant with nautical astronomy.\r\n\r\nLet us look at the present Council. Is there a single mathematician\r\namongst them, if we except Mr Barlow, whose deservedly high reputation\r\nrests chiefly on his physical and experimental inquiries, and whom the\r\nPresident and the Admiralty have clearly shown they do not look upon as\r\na mathematician, by not appointing him an adviser?\r\n\r\nSmall as the number of those persons on the Council, who are conversant\r\nwith the three subjects named in the Act of Parliament, must usually\r\nbe, it may be still further diminished. The President, when he forms\r\nhis Council, may decline naming those members who are most fit for such\r\nsituations. Or, on the other hand, some of those members who are best\r\nqualified for them, from their knowledge, may decline the honour of\r\nbeing the nominees of Mr. Gilbert, as Vice Presidents, Treasurers, or\r\nCouncillors, and thus lending their names to support a system of which\r\nthey disapprove.\r\n\r\nWhether the first of these causes has ever operated can be best\r\nexplained by those gentlemen who have been on the Council. The refusals\r\nare, notwithstanding the President's taciturnity on the subject, better\r\nknown than he is willing that they should be.\r\n\r\nHaving discussed the general policy of the measure, with reference both\r\nto the Society and to the public, and without the slightest reference\r\nto the individuals who may have refused or accepted those situations, I\r\nshall now examine the propriety of the appointments that have been made.\r\n\r\nDoubtless the gentlemen who now hold those situations either have never\r\nconsidered the influence such a mode of selection would have on the\r\ncharacter of the Council; or, having considered it, they must have\r\narrived at a different conclusion from mine. There may, however,\r\nbe arguments which I have overlooked, and a discussion of them must\r\nultimately lead to truth: but I confess that it appears to me the\r\nobjections which have been stated rest on principles of human nature,\r\ntoo deeply seated to be easily removed.\r\n\r\nThat I am not singular in the view I have taken of this subject, appears\r\nfrom several circumstances. A question was asked respecting these\r\nappointments at the Anniversary before the last; and, from the nature of\r\nthe answer, many of the members of the Society have been led to believe\r\nthe objections have been removed. Several Fellows of the Society, who\r\nknew these facts, thought it inexpedient ever to vote for placing any\r\ngentleman on the Council who had accepted these situations; and,\r\nhaving myself the same view of the case, I applied to the Council to be\r\ninformed of the names of the present Scientific Advisers. But although\r\nthey remonstrated against the PRINCIPLE, they replied that they had \"NO\r\nCOGNIZANCE\" of the fact.\r\n\r\nThe two first members of the Council, Mr. Herschel and Captain\r\nKater, who were so appointed, and who had previously been Resident\r\nCommissioners under the Act, immediately refused the situations. Dr.\r\nYoung became one of the Advisers; and Captain Sabine and Mr. Faraday\r\nwere appointed by the Admiralty as the two remaining ones. Of Dr. Young,\r\nwho died shortly after, I shall only observe that he possessed knowledge\r\nwhich qualified him for the situation.\r\n\r\nWhether those who at present fill these offices can be said to belong\r\nto that class of persons which the Order in Council and the Act of\r\nParliament point out, is a matter on which doubt may reasonably be\r\nentertained. The Order in Council speaks of these three persons as being\r\nthe same, and having the \"SAME DUTIES\" as those mentioned in the Act;\r\nand it recites the words of the Act, that they shall be persons \"WELL\r\nVERSED IN THE SCIENCES OF MATHEMATICS ASTRONOMY, AND NAVIGATION.\" Of\r\nthe fitness of the gentlemen who now hold those situations to pronounce\r\njudgment on mathematical questions, the public will be better able to\r\nform an opinion when they shall have communicated to the world any\r\nof their own mathematical inquiries. Although it is the practice to\r\nconsider that acceptance of office is alone necessary to qualify a man\r\nfor a statesman, a similar doctrine has not yet prevailed in the world\r\nof science. One of these gentlemen, who has established his reputation\r\nas a chemist, stands in the same predicament with respect to the other\r\ntwo sciences. It remains then to consider Captain Sabine's claims, which\r\nmust rest on his skill in \"PRACTICAL ASTRONOMY AND NAVIGATION,\"--a claim\r\nwhich can only be allowed when the scientific world are set at rest\r\nrespecting the extraordinary nature of those observations contained in\r\nhis work on the Pendulum.\r\n\r\nThat volume, printed under the authority of the Board of Longitude,\r\nexcited at its appearance considerable attention. The circumstance of\r\nthe Government providing instruments and means of transport for the\r\npurpose of these inquiries, placed at Captain Sabine's disposal means\r\nsuperior to those which amateurs can generally afford, whilst the\r\nindustry with which he availed himself of these opportunities, enabled\r\nhim to bring home multitudes of observations from situations rarely\r\nvisited with such instruments, and for such purposes.\r\n\r\nThe remarkable agreement with each other, which was found to exist\r\namongst each class of observations, was as unexpected by those most\r\nconversant with the respective processes, as it was creditable to one\r\nwho had devoted but a few years to the subject, and who, in the course\r\nof those voyages, used some of the instruments for the first time in his\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nThis accordance amongst the results was such, that naval officers of the\r\ngreatest experience, confessed themselves unable to take such\r\nlunars; whilst other observers, long versed in the use of the transit\r\ninstrument, avowed their inability to take such transits. Those who were\r\nconversant with pendulums, were at a loss how to make, even under more\r\nfavourable circumstances, similarly concordant observations. The same\r\nopinion prevailed on the continent as well as in England. On whatever\r\nsubject Captain Sabine touched, the observations he published seemed by\r\ntheir accuracy to leave former observers at a distance. The methods\r\nof using the instruments scarcely differed in any important point from\r\nthose before adopted; and, but for a fortunate discovery, which I shall\r\npresently relate, the world must have concluded that Captain Sabine\r\npossessed some keenness of vision, or acuteness of touch, which it would\r\nbe hopeless for any to expect to rival.\r\n\r\nThe Council of the Royal Society spared no pains to stamp the accuracy\r\nof these observations with their testimony. They seem to have thrust\r\nCaptain Sabine's name perpetually on their minutes, and in a manner\r\nwhich must have been almost distressing: they recommend him in a letter\r\nto the Admiralty, then in another to the Ordnance; and several of\r\nthe same persons, in their other capacity, as members of the Board of\r\nLongitude, after voting him a THOUSAND POUNDS for these observations,\r\nare said to have again recommended him to the Master-General of the\r\nOrdnance. That an officer, commencing his scientific career, should be\r\nmisled by such praises, was both natural and pardonable; but that the\r\nCouncil of the Royal Society should adopt their opinion so heedlessly,\r\nand maintain it so pertinaciously, was as cruel to the observer as it\r\nwas injurious to the interests of science.\r\n\r\nIt might have been imagined that such praises, together with the Copley\r\nmedal, presented to Captain Sabine by the Royal Society, and the medal\r\nof Lalande, given to him by the Institute of France, had arisen from\r\nsuch a complete investigation of his observations, as should place them\r\nbeyond the reach even of criticism. But, alas! the Royal Society may\r\nwrite, and nobody will attend; its medals have lost their lustre;\r\nand even the Institute of France may find that theirs cannot confer\r\nimmortality. That learned body is in the habit of making most\r\ninteresting and profound reports on any memoirs communicated to it;\r\nnothing escapes the penetration of their committees appointed for such\r\npurposes. Surely, when they enter on the much more important subject\r\nof the award of a medal, unusual pains must be taken with the previous\r\nreport, and it might, perhaps, be of some advantage to science, and\r\nmight furnish their admirers with arguments in their defence, if they\r\nwould publish that on which the decree of their Lalande's medal to\r\nCaptain Sabine was founded.\r\n\r\nIt is far from necessary to my present object, to state all that has\r\nbeen written and said respecting these pendulum experiments: I shall\r\nconfine myself merely to two points; one, the transit observations, I\r\nshall allude to, because I may perhaps show the kind of feeling that\r\nexists respecting them, and possibly enable Captain Sabine to explain\r\nthem. The other point, the error in the estimation of the division of\r\nthe level, I shall discuss, because it is an admitted fact.\r\n\r\nSome opinion may be formed of transit observations, by taking the\r\ndifference of times of the passage of any star between the several\r\nwires; supposing the distances of those wires equal, the intervals of\r\ntime occupied by the star in passing from one to the other, ought to be\r\nprecisely the same. As those times of passing from one wire to another\r\nare usually given to seconds and tenths of seconds, it rarely happens\r\nthat the accordance is perfect.\r\n\r\nThe transit instrument used by Captain Sabine was thirty inches in\r\nlength, and the wires are stated to be equi-distant. Out of about 370\r\ntransits, there are eighty-seven, or nearly one-fourth, which have the\r\nintervals between all the wires agreeing to the same, the tenth of\r\na second. At Sierra Leone, nineteen out of seventy-two have the same\r\naccordance; and of the moon culminating stars, p. 409, twelve out of\r\ntwenty-four are equally exact. With larger instruments, and in great\r\nobservatories, this is not always the case.\r\n\r\nCaptain Kater has given, in the Philosophical Transactions, 1819, p.\r\n427, a series of transits, with a three and a half foot transit, in\r\nwhich about one-eleventh part of them only have this degree of accuracy;\r\nand it should be observed that not merely the instrument, but the stars\r\nselected, have, in this instance, an advantage over Captain Sabine's.\r\n\r\nThe transit of M. Bessel is five feet in length, made by Frauenhofer,\r\nand the magnifying power employed is 182; yet, out of some observations\r\nof his in January, 1826, only one-eleventh have this degree of\r\naccordance. In thirty-three of the Greenwich observations of January,\r\n1828, fifteen have this agreement, or five-elevenths; but this is with\r\na ten-feet transit. Now in none of these instances do the times agree\r\nwithin a tenth of a second between all the wires; but I have accounted\r\nthose as agreeing in all the wires in which there is not more than\r\nfour-tenths of a second between the greatest and least.\r\n\r\nThis superior accuracy of the small instrument requires some\r\nexplanation. One which has been suggested is, that Captain Sabine\r\nemploys a chronometer to observe transits with; and that since it beats\r\nfive times in two seconds, each beat will give four-tenths of a second;\r\nand this being the smallest quantity registered, the agreement becomes\r\nmore probable than if tenths were the smallest quantities noticed. In\r\ngeneral, the larger the lowest unity employed the greater will be the\r\napparent agreement amongst the differences. Thus, if, in the transit of\r\nstars near the pole, the times of passing the wires were only registered\r\nto the nearest minute, the intervals would almost certainly be equal.\r\nThere is another circumstance, about which there is some difficulty. It\r\nis understood that the same instrument,--the thirty-inch transit, was\r\nemployed by Lieutenant Foster; and it has not been stated that the wires\r\nwere changed, although this has most probably been the case. Now, in the\r\ntransits which the later observer has given, he has found it necessary\r\nto correct for a considerable inequality between the first and second\r\nwires (See Phil. Trans. 1827). If an erroneous impression has gone\r\nabroad on this subject, it is doing a service to science to insure its\r\ncorrection, by drawing attention to it.\r\n\r\nShould these observations be confirmed by other observers, it would seem\r\nto follow that the use of a chronometer renders a transit more exact,\r\nand therefore that it ought to be used in observatories.\r\n\r\nAmong the instruments employed by Captain Sabine, was a repeating circle\r\nof six inches diameter, made by order of the Board of Longitude, for the\r\nexpress purpose of ascertaining how far repeating instruments might be\r\ndiminished in size:--a most important subject, on which the Board seem\r\nto have entertained a very commendable degree of anxiety.\r\n\r\nThe following extract from the \"Pendulum Experiments\" is important:\r\n\r\n\"The repeating circle was made by the direction, and at the expense of\r\nthe Board of Longitude, for the purpose of exemplifying the principle\r\nof repetition when applied to a circle of so small a diameter as six\r\ninches, carrying a telescope of seven inches focal length, and one inch\r\naperture; and of practically ascertaining the degree of accuracy which\r\nmight be retained, whilst the portability of the instrument should be\r\nincreased, by a reduction in the size to half the amount which had been\r\npreviously regarded by the most eminent artists as the extreme limit\r\nof diminution to which repeating circles, designed for astronomical\r\npurposes, ought to be carried.\r\n\r\n\"The practical value of the six-inch repeating circle may be estimated,\r\nby comparing the differences of the partial results from the mean at\r\neach station, with the correspondence of any similar collection of\r\nobservations made with a circle, on the original construction, and of\r\nlarge dimensions; such, for instance, as the latitudes of the stations\r\nof the French are, recorded in the Base du Systeme Metrique: when, if\r\ndue allowance be made for the extensive experience and great skill of\r\nthe distinguished persons who conducted the French observations, the\r\ncomparison will scarcely appear to the disadvantage of the smaller\r\ncircle, even if extended generally through all the stations of the\r\npresent volume; but if it be particularly directed to Maranham and\r\nSpitzbergen,--at which stations the partial results were more numerous\r\nthan elsewhere, and obtained with especial regard to every circumstance\r\nby which their accuracy might be affected, the performance of the\r\nsix-inch circle will appear fully equal to that of circles of the larger\r\ndimension. The comparison with the two stations, at which a more than\r\nusual attention was bestowed, is the more appropriate, because it was\r\nessential to the purposes for which the latitudes of the French stations\r\nwere required, that the observations should always be conducted with the\r\nutmost possible regard to accuracy.\r\n\r\n\"It would appear, therefore, that in a repeating circle of six inches,\r\nthe disadvantages of a smaller image enabling a less precise contact\r\nor bisection, and of an arch of less radius admitting of a less minute\r\nsubdivision, may be compensated by the principle of repetition.\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Sabine has pointed out Maranham and Spitzbergen as places most\r\nfavourable to the comparison. Let us take the former of these places,\r\nand compare the observations made there with the small repeating\r\ninstrument of six inches diameter, with those made by the French\r\nastronomers at Formentera, with a repeating circle of forty-one\r\ncenti-metres, or about sixteen inches in diameter, made by Fortin. It\r\nis singular that this instrument was directed, by the French Board\r\nof Longitude, to be made expressly for this survey, and the French\r\nastronomers paid particular attention to it, from the circumstance\r\nof some doubts having been entertained respecting the value of the\r\nprinciple of repetition.\r\n\r\nThe following series of observations were made with the two instruments.\r\n[I have chosen the inferior meridian altitude of Polaris, merely because\r\nthe number of sets of observations are rather fewer. The difference\r\nbetween the extremes of the altitude of Polaris, deduced from sets taken\r\nabove the pole by the same observers, amounts to seven seconds and a\r\nhalf.]\r\n\r\nLatitude deduced from Polaris, with a repeating circle, 16 inches\r\ndiameter.--BASE DU SYSTEME METRIQUE, tom. iv. p. 376. 1807.\r\n\r\n     Number of           Latitude              Names of Observers.\r\n     Observations.       of Formentera.\r\n\r\n                         deg. min. sec.\r\n      64                  38  39  55.3         Biot\r\n     100                          54.7         Arago\r\n      10                          56.2         Biot\r\n      88                          56.9         Biot\r\n     120                          56.7         Arago\r\n      84                          54.9         Biot\r\n     100                          56.5         Arago\r\n     102                          57.1         Arago\r\n      80                          54.5         Biot\r\n      88                          53.3         Arago\r\n      90                          53.6         Arago\r\n      88                          53.8         Arago\r\n      92                          53.7         Arago\r\n      42                          55.6         Chaix\r\n      90                          54.1         Chaix\r\n      80                          53.9         Arago\r\n\r\n     Mean of 1318 Observations, 38deg. 39min. 54.93sec.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSets of Observations made with a six-inch repeating circle, at Maranham.\r\n\r\n   Star.

One second and three-tenths\r\nis the greatest deviation from the mean of the Maranham observations;\r\nwhilst the greatest deviation of those of Formentera, is two seconds\r\nand two-tenths. If this mode of comparison should be thought unfair, on\r\naccount of the greater number of the sets in the French observations,\r\nlet any six, in succession, of those sets be taken, and compared with\r\nthe six English sets; and it will be found that in no one instance is\r\nthe greatest deviation from the mean of the whole of the observations\r\nless than in those of Maranham. It must also be borne in mind, that\r\nby the latitude deduced by the mean of 1250 superior culminations of\r\nPolaris by the same observers, the latitude of Formentera was found to\r\nbe 38deg. 39min 57.07sec., a result differing by 2.14sec. from the mean\r\nof the 1318 inferior culminations given above. [This difference cannot\r\nbe accounted for by any difference in the tables of refraction, as\r\nneither the employment of those of Bradley, of Piazzi, of the French, of\r\nGroombridge, of Young, of Ivory, of Bessel, or of Carlini, would make a\r\ndifference of two-tenths of a second.]\r\n\r\nThese facts alone ought to have awakened the attention of Captain\r\nSabine, and of those who examined and officially pronounced on the\r\nmerits of his observations; for, supposing the skill of the observers\r\nequal, it seems a necessary consequence that \"the performance of the\r\nsix-inch circle is\" not merely \"fully equal to that of circles of larger\r\ndimensions,\" but that it is decidedly SUPERIOR to one of sixteen inches\r\nin diameter.\r\n\r\nThis opinion did indeed gain ground for a time; but, fortunately for\r\nastronomy, long after these observations were made, published, and\r\nrewarded, Captain Kater, having borrowed the same instrument, discovered\r\nthat the divisions of its level, which Captain Sabine had considered to\r\nbe equal to one second each, were, in fact, more nearly equal to eleven\r\nseconds, each one being 10.9sec. This circumstance rendered necessary\r\na recalculation of all the observations made with that instrument: a\r\nre-calculation which I am not aware Captain Sabine has ever thought it\r\nnecessary to publish. [Above two hundred sets of observations with this\r\ninstrument are given in the work alluded to. It can never be esteemed\r\nsatisfactory merely to state the mean results of the corrections arising\r\nfrom this error: for the confidence to be attached to that mean will\r\ndepend on the nature of the deviations from it.]\r\n\r\nThis is the more to be regretted, as it bears upon a point of\r\nconsiderable importance to navigation; and if it should have caused\r\nany alteration in his opinion as to the comparative merits of great and\r\nsmall instruments, it might have been expected from a gentleman, who was\r\nexpressly directed by the Board of Longitude, to try the question with\r\nan instrument constructed for that especial purpose.\r\n\r\nFinding that this has not been done by the person best qualified for\r\nthe task, perhaps a few remarks from one who has no pretensions to\r\nfamiliarity with the instrument, may tend towards elucidating this\r\ninteresting question.\r\n\r\nThe following table gives the latitudes as corrected for the error of\r\nlevel:\r\n\r\n Station.

The second column of the table of\r\nlatitudes must now be considered the true one, as that which really\r\nresulted from the observations. Now, on examining the column of true\r\nlatitudes, the differences between the different sets of observations is\r\nso considerable as naturally to excite some fear of latent error, more\r\nespecially as nearly the greatest discordance arises from the same star,\r\nAlph.Lyrae, observed after an interval of only three days. It becomes\r\ninteresting to every person engaged in making astronomical observations,\r\nto know what is the probability of his being exposed to an error so\r\nlittle to be guarded against, and so calculated to lull the suspicions\r\nof the unfortunate astronomer to whom it may happen.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the question resolves itself into this: the true latitude of\r\na place being determined by sets of observations as in the first of the\r\nfollowing columns--\r\n\r\n                                                     Latitudes as\r\n     True latitudes observed.                    computed by a mistake\r\n                                                   of Capt. Sabine's.\r\n\r\n                                 deg.min.sec.       deg.min.sec.\r\n     Alph.Lyrae, 28th Aug....  2  31  22.0        2  31  42.4\r\n     Alph.Lyrae, 29th Aug....         31.8               43.8\r\n     Alph.Pavonis, 29th Aug...         44,0               44.5\r\n     Alph.Lyrae, 31st Aug....         42.6               44.6\r\n     Alph.Cygni, 31st Aug....         39.2               42.0\r\n     Alph.Gruris, 2d Sept....         27.4               42.2\r\n\r\nwhat are the chances that, by one error all the latitudes in the first\r\ncolumn should be brought so nearly to an agreement as they are in the\r\nsecond column? The circumstance of the number of divisions of the\r\nlevel being almost arbitrary within limits, might perhaps be alleged as\r\ndiminishing this extraordinary improbability: but let any one consider,\r\nif he choose the error of each set, as independent of the others, still\r\nhe will find the odds against it enormous.\r\n\r\nWhen it is considered that an error, almost arbitrary in its law, has\r\nthus had the effect of bringing discordant observations into an almost\r\nunprecedented accordance, as at Maranham; and not merely so, but that\r\nat eight of the nine stations it has uniformly tended to diminish the\r\ndifferences between the partial results, and that at the ninth station\r\nit only increased it by a small fraction of a second, I cannot help\r\nfeeling that it is more probable even that Captain Kater, with all his\r\nadmitted skill, and that Captain Sabine himself, should have been both\r\nmistaken in their measures of the divisions of the level, than that so\r\nsingular an effect should have been produced by one error; and I cannot\r\nbring myself to believe that such an anticipation is entirely without\r\nfoundation.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the result of a re-examination, it was a singular\r\noversight NOT TO MEASURE the divisions of a level intended to be used\r\nfor determining so important a question; more particularly as, in the\r\nvery work to which reference was made by Captain Sabine for the purpose\r\nof comparing the observations, it was the very first circumstance which\r\noccupied the French philosophers, and several pages [See pages 265\r\nto 275 of the RECUEIL D'OBSERVATIONS GEODESIQUES, &c. PAR MM. BIOT ET\r\nARAGO, which forms the fourth volume of the BASE DU SYSTEME METRIQUE.]\r\nare filled with the details relative to the determination of the value\r\nof the divisions of the level. It would also have been satisfactory,\r\nwith such an important object in view, to have read off some of the sets\r\nafter each pair of observations, in order to see how far the system of\r\nrepetition made the results gradually converge to a limit, and in order\r\nto know how many repetitions were sufficient. Such a course would almost\r\ncertainly have led to a knowledge of the true value of the divisions of\r\nthe level; for the differences in the altitude of the same star, after a\r\nfew minutes of time, must, in many instances, have been far too great to\r\nhave arisen from the change of its altitude: and had these been noticed,\r\nthey must have been referred to some error in the instrument, which\r\ncould scarcely, in such circumstances, have escaped detection.\r\n\r\nI have now mentioned a few of the difficulties which attend Captain\r\nSabine's book on the pendulum, difficulties which I am far from saying\r\nare inexplicable. He would be bold indeed who, after so wonderful an\r\ninstance of the effect of chance as I have been just discussing, should\r\nventure to pronounce another such accident impossible; but I think\r\nenough has been said to show, that the feeling which so generally\r\nprevails relative to it, is neither captious nor unreasonable.\r\n\r\nEnough also has appeared to prove, that the conduct of the Admiralty in\r\nappointing that gentleman one of their scientific advisers, was, under\r\nthe peculiar circumstances, at least, unadvised. They have thus lent, as\r\nfar as they could, the weight of their authority to support observations\r\nwhich are now found to be erroneous. They have thus held up for\r\nimitation observations which may induce hundreds of meritorious officers\r\nto throw aside their instruments, in the despair of ever approaching a\r\nstandard which is since admitted to be imaginary; and they have ratified\r\nthe doctrine, for I am not aware their official adviser has ever\r\neven modified it, that diminutive instruments are equal almost to the\r\nlargest.\r\n\r\nTo what extent this doctrine is correct, may perhaps yet admit of doubt.\r\nIt cannot, however, admit of a doubt, that it is unwise to crown it with\r\nofficial authority, and thus expose the officers of their service to\r\ndepend on means which may be quite insufficient for their purpose.\r\n\r\nHow the Board of Longitude, after EXPRESSLY DIRECTING THIS INSTRUMENT\r\nTO BE MADE AND TRIED, could come to the decision at which they arrived,\r\nappears inexplicable. The known difference of opinion amongst the best\r\nobservers respecting the repeating principle, ought to have rendered\r\nthem peculiarly cautious, nor ought the opinion of a Troughton, that\r\ninstruments of less than one foot in diameter may be considered,\r\n\"FOR ASTRONOMY, AS LITTLE BETTER THAN PLAYTHINGS,\" [Memoirs of the\r\nAstronomical Society, Vol.I. p.53.] to have been rejected without the\r\nmost carefully detailed experiments. There were amongst that body,\r\npersons who must have examined minutely the work on the Pendulum.\r\nCaptain Kater must have felt those difficulties in the perusal of it\r\nwhich other observers have experienced; and he who was placed in the\r\nBoard of Longitude especially for his knowledge of instruments, might,\r\nin a few hours, have arrived at more decisive facts. But perhaps I am\r\nunjust. Captain Kater's knowledge rendered it impossible for him to have\r\nbeen ignorant of the difficulties, and his candour would have prevented\r\nhim from concealing them: he must, therefore, after examining the\r\nsubject, have been outvoted by his lay-brethren who had dispensed with\r\nthat preliminary.\r\n\r\nIt would be unjust, before quitting this subject, not to mention with\r\nrespect the acknowledgment made by an officer of the naval service of\r\nthe errors into which he also fell from this same level. Lieutenant\r\nFoster, aware of the many occasions on which Captain Sabine had employed\r\nthis instrument, and knowing that he considered each division as equal\r\nto one second, never thought that a doubt could exist on the subject,\r\nand made all his calculations accordingly. When Captain Kater made him\r\nacquainted with the mistake, Lieutenant Foster immediately communicated\r\na paper [The paper of Lieutenant Foster is printed in the Philosophical\r\nTransactions, 1827, p.122, and is worth consulting.] to the Royal\r\nSociety, in which he states the circumstance most fully, and recomputed\r\nall the observations in which that instrument was used. Unfortunately,\r\nfrom the original observations of Mr. Ross being left on board the Fury\r\nat the time of her loss, the transcripts of his results could not be\r\nrecomputed like the rest, and were consequently useless.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION 5. OF THE UNION OF SEVERAL OFFICES IN ONE PERSON.\r\n\r\nAlthough the number of situations to which persons conversant with\r\nscience may hope to be appointed, is small, yet it has somewhat\r\nsingularly happened, that instances of one individual, holding more than\r\none such appointment, are frequent. Not to speak of those held by the\r\nlate Dr. Young, we have at present:--\r\n\r\nMR. POND--Astronomer Royal, Inspector of Chronometers, and\r\nSuperintendent of the Nautical Almanac.\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN SABINE--An officer of artillery on leave of absence from his\r\nregiment; Secretary of the Royal Society; and Scientific Adviser of the\r\nAdmiralty.\r\n\r\nMR. BRANDE--Clerk of the Irons at the Royal Mint; Professor of Chemistry\r\nat the Royal Institution; Analyser of Rough Nitre, &c. to the East-India\r\nCompany; Lecturer on Materia Medica, Apothecaries' Hall; Superintending\r\nChemical Operator at ditto; Lecturer on Chemistry at ditto; Editor\r\nof the Royal Institution Journal; and Foreign Secretary to the Royal\r\nSociety.\r\n\r\nOne should be led to imagine, from these unions of scientific offices,\r\neither that science is too little paid, and that gentlemen cannot be\r\nfound to execute the offices separately at the salaries offered;\r\nor else, that it is too well paid, since each requires such little\r\nattention, that almost any number can be executed by one person.\r\n\r\nThe Director of the Royal Observatory has a larger and better collection\r\nof instruments, and more assistants to superintend, than any other\r\nastronomer in the world; and, to do it properly, would require the\r\nalmost undivided attention of a man in the vigour of youth. Nor would\r\na superintendent of the Nautical Almanac, if he made a point of being\r\nacquainted with every thing connected with his subject, find his\r\nsituation at all a sinecure. Slight as are the duties of the Foreign\r\nSecretary of the Royal Society, it might have been supposed that Mr.\r\nBrande would scarcely, amongst his multifarious avocations, have found\r\ntime even for them. But it may be a consolation to him to know, that\r\nfrom the progress the Society is making, those duties must become\r\nshortly, if they are not already, almost extinct.\r\n\r\nDoubtless the President, in making that appointment, looked most\r\nanxiously over the list of the Royal Society. He doubtless knew that the\r\nAcademics of Sweden, of Denmark, of Scotland, of Prussia, of\r\nHanover, and of France, derived honour from the discoveries of their\r\nSecretaries;--that they prided themselves in the names of Berzelius, of\r\nOersted, of Brewster, of Encke, of Gauss, and of Cuvier. Doubtless the\r\nPresident must have been ambitious that England should contribute to\r\nthis galaxy of glory, that the Royal Society should restore the lost\r\nPleiad [Pleiades, an assemblage of seven stars in the neck of the\r\nconstellation Taurus. There are now only six of them visible to the\r\nnaked eye.--HUTTON'S DICTIONARY--Art. Pleiades.] to the admiring science\r\nof Europe. But he could discover no kindred name amongst the ranks of\r\nhis supporters, and forgot, for a moment, the interest of the Society,\r\nin an amiable consideration for the feelings of his surrounding friends.\r\nFor had the President chosen a brighter star, the lustre of his other\r\nofficers might have been overpowered by its splendour: but relieved\r\nfrom the pain of such a contrast, he may still retain the hope, that,\r\nby their united brightness, these suns of his little system shall yet\r\nafford sufficient light to be together visible to distant nations, as a\r\nfaint NEBULA in the obscure horizon of English science.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION 6. OF THE FUNDS OF THE SOCIETY.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Society is not in a state approaching to poverty, it may be\r\nuseful to offer a few remarks respecting the distribution of its money.\r\n\r\nEXPENSE OF ENGRAVINGS FOR SIR E. HOME'S PAPERS.--The great expense\r\nof the engravings which adorn the volumes of the Philosophical\r\nTransactions, is not sufficiently known. That many of those engravings\r\nare quite essential for the papers they illustrate, and that those\r\npapers are fit for the Transactions, I do not doubt; but, some inquiry\r\nis necessary, when such large sums are expended. I shall endeavour,\r\ntherefore, to approximate to the sum these engravings have cost the\r\nRoyal Society.\r\n\r\nPrevious to 1810, there are upwards of seventy plates to papers of\r\nSir E. Home's; in many of these, which I have purposely separated, the\r\nworkmanship is not so minute as in the succeeding ones. Since 1810,\r\nthere have occurred 187 plates attached to papers of the same author.\r\nMany of these have cost from twelve to twenty guineas each plate; but\r\nI shall take five pounds as the average cost of the first portion, and\r\ntwelve as that of the latter. This would produce,\r\n\r\n      70 X  5 =  350\r\n     187 X 12 = 2244\r\n     ......    -----......    L2594\r\n\r\nAs this is only proposed as a rough approximation, let us omit the odd\r\nhundreds, and we have two thousand pounds expended in plates only on ONE\r\nbranch of science, and for one person! Without calling in question\r\nthe importance of the discoveries contained in those papers, it may be\r\npermitted to doubt whether such a large sum might not have been expended\r\nin a manner more beneficial to science. Not being myself conversant with\r\nthose subjects, I can only form an opinion of the value from extraneous\r\ncircumstances. Had their importance been at all equal to their number,\r\nI should have expected to have heard amongst the learned of other\r\ncountries much more frequent mention of them than I have done, and even\r\nthe Council of the Royal Society would scarcely have excluded from\r\ntheir Transactions one of those productions which they had paid for as a\r\nlecture.\r\n\r\nIt might also have been more delicate not to have placed on the Council\r\nso repeatedly a gentleman, for whose engravings they were annually\r\nexpending, during the last twenty years, about an hundred pounds. On\r\nthe other hand, when the Council lent Sir E. Home the whole of\r\nthose valuable plates to take off impressions for his large work on\r\nComparative Anatomy, of which they constitute almost the whole, it might\r\nhave been as well not to have obliterated from each plate all indication\r\nof the source to which he was indebted for them.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRESIDENT'S DISCOURSES.--I shall mention this circumstance, because\r\nit fell under my own observation.\r\n\r\nObserving in the annual accounts a charge of 381L 5s. for the\r\nPresident's Speeches, I thought it right to inquire into the nature\r\nof this item. Happening to be on the Council the next year, I took an\r\nopportunity, at an early meeting of that Council, to ask publicly for\r\nan explanation of the following resolution, which stands in the\r\nCouncil-books for Dec. 21, 1828.\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That 500 copies of the President's Discourses, about to be\r\nprinted by Mr. Murray, be purchased by the Society, at the usual trade\r\nprice.\"\r\n\r\nThe answer given to that question was, \"THAT THE COUNCIL HAD AGREED TO\r\nPURCHASE THESE VOLUMES AT THAT PRICE, IN ORDER TO INDUCE MR. MURRAY TO\r\nPRINT THE PRESIDENT'S SPEECHES.\"\r\n\r\nI remarked at the time that such an answer was quite unsatisfactory, as\r\nthe following statement will prove.\r\n\r\nThe volume consists of 160 pages, or twenty sheets, and the following\r\nprices are very liberal:\r\n\r\n                                                   L  s. d.\r\n     To composing and printing twenty sheets, at\r\n          3L. per sheet...............             60  0  0\r\n     Twenty reams of paper, at 3L. per ream.....   60  0  0\r\n     Corrections, alterations, &c..........        30  0  0\r\n\r\n     Total cost of 500 copies......               150  0  0\r\n\r\nNow upon the subject of the expense of printing, the Council could not\r\nplead ignorance. The Society are engaged in printing, and in paying\r\nprinters' bills, too frequently to admit of such an excuse; and several\r\nof the individual members must have known, from their own private\r\nexperience, that the cost of printing such a volume was widely different\r\nfrom that they were about to pay, as an inducement to a bookseller to\r\nprint it on his own account. Here, then, was a sum of above two hundred\r\npounds beyond what was necessary for the object, taken from the funds\r\nof the Royal Society; and for what purpose? Did the President and his\r\nofficers ever condescend to explain this transaction to the Council;\r\nor were they expected, as a matter of course, to sanction any thing\r\nproposed to them? Could they have been so weak, or so obedient, as to\r\norder the payment of above three hundred and eighty pounds, to induce a\r\nbookseller to do what they might have done themselves for less than half\r\nthe sum? Or did they wish to make Mr. Murray a present of two hundred\r\npounds? If so, he must have had powerful friends in the Council, and it\r\nis fit the Society should know who they were; for they were not friends,\r\neither to its interests or to its honour.\r\n\r\nThe copies, so purchased, were ordered by the Council to be sold to\r\nmembers of the Society at 15s. each: (the trade price is 15s. 3d.) and\r\nout of the five hundred copies twenty-seven only have been sold: the\r\nremainder encumber our shelves. Thus, after four years, the Society are\r\nstill losers of three hundred and sixty Pounds on this transaction.\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE CONVERSION OF THE GREENWICH OBSERVATIONS INTO\r\nPASTEBOARD.--Although the printing of these observations is not paid for\r\nout of the funds of the Royal Society, yet as the Council of that body\r\nare the visitors of the Royal Observatory, it may not be misplaced to\r\nintroduce the subject here.\r\n\r\nSome years since, a member of the Royal Society accidentally learned,\r\nthat there was, at an old store-shop in Thames Street, a large quantity\r\nof the volumes of the Greenwich Observations on sale as waste paper. On\r\nmaking inquiry, he ascertained that there were two tons and a half to be\r\ndisposed of, and that an equal quantity had already been sold, for the\r\npurpose of converting it into pasteboard. The vendor said he could get\r\nfourpence a pound for the whole, and that it made capital Bristol board.\r\nThe fact was mentioned by a member of the Council of the Royal Society,\r\nand they thought it necessary to inquire into the circumstances.\r\n\r\nNow, the Observations made at the Royal Observatory are printed with\r\nevery regard to typographical luxury, with large margins, on thick\r\npaper, hotpressed, and with no sort of regard to economy. This\r\nmagnificence is advocated by some who maintain, that the volumes ought\r\nto be worthy of a great nation; whilst others, seeing how little that\r\nnation spends on science, regret that the sums allotted to it should not\r\nbe applied with the strictest economy. If the Astronomer Royal really\r\nhas a right to these volumes, printed by the government at a large\r\nexpense, it is, perhaps, the most extravagant mode which was ever\r\nyet invented of paying a public servant. When that right was given to\r\nhim,--let us suppose somebody had suggested the impolicy of it, lest he\r\nshould sell the costly volumes for waste paper,--who would have listened\r\nfor one moment to such a supposition? He would have been told that\r\nit was impossible to suppose a person in that high and responsible\r\nsituation, could be so indifferent to his own reputation.\r\n\r\nA short time since, I applied to the President and Council of the Royal\r\nSociety, for copies of the Greenwich Observations, which were necessary\r\nfor an inquiry on which I was at that time engaged. Being naturally\r\nanxious to economize the small funds I can devote to science, the\r\nrequest appeared to me a reasonable one. It was, however, refused; and\r\nI was at the same time informed that the Observations could be purchased\r\nat the bookseller's. [This was a mistake; Mr. Murray has not copies\r\nof the Greenwich Observations prior to 1823.] When I consider that\r\npractical astronomy has not occupied a very prominent place in my\r\npursuits, I feel disposed, on that ground, to acquiesce in the propriety\r\nof the refusal. This excuse can, however, be of no avail for similar\r\nrefusals to other gentlemen, who applied nearly at the same time with\r\nmyself, and whose time had been successfully devoted to the cultivation\r\nof that science. [M. Bessel, at the wish of the Royal Academy of Berlin,\r\nprojected a plan for making a very extensive map of the heavens. Too\r\nvast for any individual to attempt, it was proposed that a portion\r\nshould be executed by the astronomers of various countries, and\r\ninvitations to this effect were widely circulated. One only of the\r\ndivisions of this map was applied for by any English astronomer; and,\r\nafter completing the portion of the map assigned to him, he undertook\r\nanother, which had remained unprovided for. This gentleman, the Rev.\r\nMr. Hussey, was one of the rejected applicants for the Greenwich\r\nObservations.]\r\n\r\nThere was, however, another ground on which I had weakly anticipated a\r\ndifferent result;--but those who occupy official situations, rendered\r\nremarkable by the illustrious names of their predecessors, are placed\r\nin no enviable station; and, if their own acquirements are confessedly\r\ninsufficient to keep up the high authority of their office, they\r\nmust submit to the mortifications of their false position. I am sure,\r\ntherefore, that the President and officers of the Royal Society must\r\nhave sympathized MOST DEEPLY with me, when they felt it their duty to\r\npropose that the Society over which Newton once presided, should refuse\r\nso trifling an assistance to the unworthy possessor of the chair he once\r\nfilled.\r\n\r\nIn reply to my application to the President and Council, to be allowed a\r\ncopy of the Greenwich Observations, I was informed that, \"The number of\r\ncopies placed by government at the disposal of the Royal Society, was\r\ninsufficient to supply the demands made on them by various learned\r\nbodies in Europe; and, consequently, they were unable, however great\r\ntheir inclination, to satisfy the wishes of individual applicants.\"\r\nNow I have spent some time in searching the numerous proceedings in the\r\ncouncil-books of the Royal Society, and I believe the following is the\r\nreal state of the case:--\r\n\r\nIn 1785, Lord Sidney, one of His Majesty's principal Secretaries of\r\nState, wrote to the Council a letter, dated Whitehall, March 8, 1785,\r\nfrom which the following is extracted:--\r\n\r\n\"The King has been pleased to consent, that any copies of the\r\nAstronomical Observations, made at the Observatory of Greenwich, (and\r\npaid for by the Board of Ordnance, pursuant to His Majesty's command,\r\nof July 21, 1767,) which may at any time remain in the hands of the\r\nprinter, shall, after you have reserved such copies as you may\r\nthink proper as presents, be given to the said Nevil Maskelyne, in\r\nconsideration of his trouble in the superintending the printing thereof.\r\nI am to signify His Majesty's pleasure, that you do, from time to time,\r\ngive the necessary orders for that purpose, until His Majesty's further\r\ncommands shall be communicated to you.\r\n\r\nSoon after this letter, I find on the council-books:--\r\n\r\n\"Ordered, That sixty copies of the Greenwich Observations, last\r\npublished, be retained as presents, and that the rest be delivered to\r\nthe Astronomer Royal.\"\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to be sure of a negative fact, but in searching many\r\nvolumes of the Proceedings of the Council, I have not discovered any\r\nrevocation of this order, and I believe none exists. This is confirmed\r\nby the circumstance of the Council at the present day receiving\r\nprecisely the same number of copies as their predecessors, and I believe\r\nthat in fact they do not know the authority on which the right to those\r\nsixty rests.\r\n\r\nSupposing this order unrevoked, it was clearly meant to be left to the\r\ndiscretion of the Council, to order such a number to be reserved, \"from\r\ntime to time,\" as the demands of science might require. When, therefore,\r\nthey found that the number of sixty copies was insufficient, they ought\r\nto have directed the printer to send them a larger number; but when they\r\nfound out the purpose to which the Astronomer Royal applied them, they\r\nought immediately to have ordered nearly the whole impression, in order\r\nto prevent this destruction of public property. If, on the other hand,\r\nthe above order is revoked, and we really have no right to more than\r\nsixty copies; then, on discovering the Observations in their progress\r\ntowards pasteboard, it was the duty of the Council of the Royal Society,\r\nas visitors of the Royal Observatory, immediately to have represented to\r\nGovernment the evil of the arrangement, and to have suggested, that if\r\nthe Astronomer Royal have the right, it would be expedient to commute it\r\nfor a liberal compensation.\r\n\r\nWhichever be the true view of the case, they have taken no steps on the\r\nsubject; and I cannot help expressing my belief, that the President and\r\nCouncil were induced to be thus negligent of the interests of science,\r\nfrom the fear of interfering with the perquisites of the Astronomer\r\nRoyal.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, but justice to observe, that the injury already done to\r\nscience, by the conversion of these Observations into pasteboard, is not\r\nso great as the public might have feared. Mr. Pond, than whom no one can\r\nbe supposed better acquainted with their value, and whose right to\r\njudge no man can question, has shown his own opinion to be, that his\r\nreputation will be best consulted by diminishing the extent of their\r\ncirculation.\r\n\r\nBefore I quit the subject of the Royal Observatory, on which much might\r\nbe said, I will just refer to the report by a Committee of the Royal\r\nSociety that was made relative to it, some years since, and which, it is\r\nimagined, is a subject by no means grateful to the memory of any of\r\nthe parties concerned in it. My object is to ascertain, whether any\r\namendments have taken place in consequence. To one fact of considerable\r\nimportance, I was myself a witness, when I was present officially at a\r\nvisitation. At that time, no original observations made at the transit\r\ninstrument were ever preserved. Had I not been an eye witness of the\r\nprocess of an observation, I should not have credited the fact.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION 7. OF THE ROYAL MEDALS.\r\n\r\nAt a period when the attention of Government to science had not\r\nundergone any marked change, a most unexpected occurrence took place.\r\nHis Majesty intimated to the Royal Society, through his Secretary of\r\nState, his intention to found two gold medals, of the value of fifty\r\nguineas each, to be awarded annually by the Council of the Royal\r\nSociety, according to the rules they were desired to frame for that\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nThe following is the copy of Mr. Peel's letter:--\r\n\r\nWHITEHALL, December 3d, 1825.\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nI am commanded by the King to acquaint you, that His Majesty proposes to\r\nfound two gold medals, of the value of fifty guineas each, to be awarded\r\nas honorary premiums, under the direction of the President and Council\r\nof the Royal Society, in such a manner as shall, by the excitement of\r\ncompetition among men of science, seem best calculated to promote the\r\nobject for which the Royal Society was instituted.\r\n\r\nHis Majesty desires to receive from the President and Council of\r\nthe Royal Society their opinion upon the subject generally of the\r\nregulations which it may be convenient to establish with regard to the\r\nappropriation of the medals; and I have, therefore, to request that\r\nyou will make the necessary communication to the Council of the Royal\r\nSociety, in order that His Majesty's wishes may be carried into effect.\r\n\r\nI have the honour to be, &c. &c. (Signed) R. PEEL.\r\n\r\nNothing could be more important for the interests of science, than this\r\ngracious manifestation of His Majesty's concern for its advancement. It\r\nwas hailed by all who were made acquainted with it, as the commencement\r\nof a new era, and the energies which it might have awakened were\r\nimmense. The unfettered nature of the gift excited admiration, whilst\r\nthe confidence reposed in the Council was calculated to have insured\r\nthe wavering faith of any less-gifted body. Even those who, either from\r\nknowing the MANAGEMENT of the Society, or from other grounds, doubted\r\nthe policy of establishing medals, saw much to admire in the tone and\r\nspirit in which they were offered.\r\n\r\nThe Council immediately came to the resolution of gratefully accepting\r\nthem: and it appears that the President communicated that resolution, on\r\nthe 26th, to Mr. Peel, in a letter, which is found on the minutes of the\r\nCouncil-book of the 26th of January.\r\n\r\nAt the same Council, the rules for the award of the Royal medals were\r\ndecided upon; they were as follow:--\r\n\r\n26th January, 1826.\r\n\r\nRESOLVED,\r\n\r\nThat it is the opinion of the Council, that the medals be awarded for\r\nthe most important discoveries or series of investigations, completed\r\nand made known to the Royal Society in the year preceding the day of\r\ntheir award.\r\n\r\nThat it is the opinion of the Council, that the presentation of the\r\nmedals should not be limited to British subjects. And they propose, if\r\nit should be His Majesty's pleasure, that his effigy should form the\r\nobverse of the medal.\r\n\r\nThat two medals from the same die should be struck upon each foundation;\r\none in gold, one in silver.\r\n\r\nIf these rules are not the wisest which might have been formed, yet\r\nthey are tolerably explicit; and it might have been imagined that even a\r\ncouncillor of the Royal Society, prepared for office by the education\r\nof a pleader, could not have mystified his brethren so completely, as\r\nto have made them doubt on the point of time. The rules fixed precisely,\r\nthat the discoveries or experiments rewarded, must be completed and made\r\nknown to the Royal Society, within the YEAR PRECEDING THE DAY of the\r\naward.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it might have been a proper mark of respect to this\r\ncommunication, to have convened a special general meeting of the\r\nSociety, to have made known to the whole body the munificent endowment\r\nof their Patron: and when his approbation of the laws which were to\r\ngovern the distribution of these medals had been intimated to the\r\nCouncil, such a course would have been in complete accordance with the\r\nwish expressed in Mr. Peel's letter, \"TO EXCITE COMPETITION AMONGST MEN\r\nOF SCIENCE\" by making them generally known.\r\n\r\nLet us now examine the first award of these medals: it is recorded in\r\nthe following words:--\r\n\r\nNovember 16, 1826.\r\n\r\nONE of the medals of His Majesty's donation for the present year was\r\nawarded to John Dalton, Esq. President of the Philosophical and Literary\r\nSociety, Manchester, for his development of the Atomic Theory, and his\r\nother important labours and discoveries in physical science.\r\n\r\nThe other medal for the present year was awarded to James Ivory,\r\nEsq. for his paper on Astronomical Refractions, published in the\r\nPhilosophical Transactions for the year 1823, and his other valuable\r\npapers on mathematical subjects.\r\n\r\nThe Copley medal was awarded to James South, Esq. for his observations\r\nof double stars, and his paper on the discordances between the sun's\r\nobserved and computed right ascensions, published in the Transactions.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to believe that the same Council, which, in January,\r\nformed the laws for the distribution of these medals, should meet\r\ntogether in November, and in direct violation of these laws, award them\r\nto two philosophers, one of whom had made, and fully established, his\r\ngreat discovery almost twenty years before; and the other of whom (to\r\nstultify themselves still more effectually) they expressly rewarded for\r\na paper made known to them three years before.\r\n\r\nWere the rules for the award of these medals read previous to their\r\ndecision? Or were the obedient Council only used to register the edict\r\nof their President? Or were they mocked, as they have been in other\r\ninstances, with the semblance of a free discussion?\r\n\r\nHas it never occurred to gentlemen who have been thus situated, that\r\nalthough they have in truth had no part in the decision, yet the Society\r\nand the public will justly attribute a portion of the merit or demerit\r\nof their award, to those to whom that trust was confided?\r\n\r\nDid no one member of the Council venture, with the most submissive\r\ndeference, to suggest to the President, that the public eye would watch\r\nwith interest this first decision on the Royal medals, and that it\r\nmight perhaps be more discreet to adjudge them, for the first time, in\r\naccordance with the laws which had been made for their distribution? Or\r\nwas public opinion then held in supreme contempt? Was it scouted, as I\r\nhave myself heard it scouted, in the councils of the Royal Society?\r\n\r\nOr was the President exempt, on this occasion, from the responsibility\r\nof dictating an award in direct violation of the faith which had been\r\npledged to the Society and to the public? and, did the Council, intent\r\non exercising a power so rarely committed to them; and, perhaps,\r\nurged by the near approach of their hour of dinner, dispense with the\r\nformality of reading the laws on which they were about to act?\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been the cause, the result was most calamitous to the\r\nSociety. Its decision was attacked on other grounds; for, with a strange\r\nneglect, the Council had taken no pains to make known, either to the\r\nSociety, or to the public, the rules they had made for the adjudication\r\nof these medals.\r\n\r\nThe evils resulting from this decision were many. In the first place, it\r\nwas most indecorous and ungrateful to treat with such neglect the rules\r\nwhich had been approved by our Royal Patron. In the next place, the\r\nmedals themselves became almost worthless from this original taint: and\r\nthey ceased to excite \"competition amongst men of science,\" because no\r\nman could feel the least security that he should get them, even though\r\nhis discoveries should fulfil all the conditions on which they were\r\noffered,\r\n\r\nThe great injury which accrued to science from this proceeding, induced\r\nme, in the succeeding session, when I found myself on the Council of\r\nthe Royal Society, to endeavour to remove the stigma which rested on\r\nour character. Whether I took the best means to remedy the evil is now\r\na matter of comparatively little consequence: had I found any serious\r\ndisposition to set it right, I should readily have aided in any plans\r\nfor doing that which I felt myself bound to attempt, even though I\r\nshould stand alone, as I had the misfortune of doing on that occasion.\r\n[It is but justice to Mr. South, who was a member of that Council, to\r\nstate, that the circumstance of his having had the Copley medal of the\r\nsame year awarded to him, prevented him from taking any part in the\r\ndiscussion.]\r\n\r\nThe impression which the whole of that discussion made on my mind\r\nwill never be effaced. Regarding the original rules formed for the\r\ndistribution of the Royal medals, when approved by his Majesty, as\r\nequally binding in honour and in justice, I viewed the decision of the\r\nCouncil, which assigned those medals to Mr. Dalton and Mr. Ivory, as\r\nvoid, IPSO FACTO, on the ground that it was directly at variance with\r\nthat part which CONFINES the medals to discoveries made known to the\r\nSociety within ONE YEAR PREVIOUS TO THE DAY OF THEIR AWARD. I therefore\r\nmoved the following resolutions:\r\n\r\n\"1st, That the award of the Royal medals, made on the 16th of November,\r\n1826, being contrary to the conditions under which they were offered, is\r\ninvalid.\r\n\r\n\"2dly, That the sum of fifty guineas each be presented to J. Dalton,\r\nEsq. and James Ivory, Esq. from the funds of the Society; and that\r\nletters be written to each of those gentlemen, expressing the hope\r\nof the Council that this, the only method which is open to them of\r\nhonourably fulfilling their pledges, will be received by those gentlemen\r\nas a mark of the high sense entertained by the Council of the importance\r\nand value of their discoveries, which require not the aid of medals\r\nto convey their reputation to posterity, as amongst the greatest which\r\ndistinguished the age in which they lived.\"\r\n\r\nIt may be curious to give the public a specimen of the reasoning\r\nemployed in so select a body of philosophers as the Council of the Royal\r\nSociety. It was contended, on the one hand, that although the award was\r\nSOMEWHAT IRREGULAR, yet nothing was more easy than to set it right. As\r\nthe original rules for giving the medals were merely an order of the\r\nCouncil,--it would only be necessary to alter them, and then the\r\naward would agree perfectly with the laws. On the other hand, it was\r\ncontended, that the original rules were unknown to the public and to the\r\nSociety; and that, in fact, they were only known to the members of\r\nthe Council and a few of their friends; and therefore the award was no\r\nbreach of faith.\r\n\r\nAll comment on such reasoning is needless. That such propositions could\r\nnot merely be offered, but could pass unreproved, is sufficient to show\r\nthat the feelings of that body do not harmonize with those of the age;\r\nand furnishes some explanation why several of the most active members of\r\nthe Royal Society have declined connecting their names with the Council\r\nas long as the present system of management is pursued.\r\n\r\nThe little interest taken by the body of the Society, either in its\r\npeculiar pursuits, or in the proceedings of the Council, and the little\r\ncommunication which exists between them, is an evil. Thus it happens\r\nthat the deeds of the Council are rarely known to the body of the\r\nSociety, and, indeed, scarcely extend beyond that small portion who\r\nfrequent the weekly meetings. These pages will perhaps afford the first\r\nnotice to the great majority of the Society of a breach of faith by\r\ntheir Council, which it is impossible to suppose a body, consisting of\r\nmore than six hundred gentlemen, could have sanctioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION 8. OF THE COPLEY MEDALS.\r\n\r\nAn important distinction exists between scientific communications, which\r\nseems to have escaped the notice of the Councils of the Royal Society.\r\nThey may contain discoveries of new principles,--of laws of nature\r\nhitherto unobserved; or they may consist of a register of observations\r\nof known phenomena, made under new circumstances, or in new and peculiar\r\nsituations on the face of our planet. Both these species of additions to\r\nour knowledge are important; but their value and their rarity are very\r\ndifferent in degree. To make and to repeat observations, even with those\r\ntrifling alterations, which it is the fashion in our country (in the\r\npresent day) to dignify with the name of discoveries, requires merely\r\ninflexible candour in recording precisely the facts which nature has\r\npresented, and a power of fixing the attention on the instruments\r\nemployed, or phenomena examined,--a talent, which can be much improved\r\nby proper Instruction, and which is possessed by most persons of\r\ntolerable abilities and education.* To discover new principles, and to\r\ndetect the undiscovered laws by which nature operates, is another and\r\na higher task, and requires intellectual qualifications of a very\r\ndifferent order: the labour of the one is like that of the computer of\r\nan almanac; the inquiries of the other resemble more the researches of\r\nthe accomplished analyst, who has invented the formula: by which those\r\ncomputations are performed.\r\n\r\n[*That the use even of the large astronomical instruments in a national\r\nobservatory, does not require any very profound acquirements, is not\r\nan opinion which I should have put forth without authority. The\r\nAstronomer-Royal ought to be the best judge.\r\n\r\nOn the minutes of the Council of the Royal Society, for April 6, 1826,\r\nwith reference to the Assistants necessary for the two mural circles,\r\nwe find a letter from Mr. Pond on the subject, from which the following\r\npassage is extracted:\r\n\r\n\"But to carry on such investigations, I want indefatigable,\r\nhard-working, and above all, obedient drudges (for so I must call\r\nthem, although they are drudges of a superior order), men who will be\r\ncontented to pass half their day in using their hands and eyes in the\r\nmechanical act of observing, and the remainder of it in the dull process\r\nof calculation.\"]\r\n\r\nSuch being the distinction between the merits of these inquiries, some\r\ndifference ought to exist in the nature of any rewards that may be\r\nproposed for their encouragement. The Royal Society have never marked\r\nthis difference, and consequently those honorary medals which are given\r\nto observations, gain a value which is due to those that are given for\r\ndiscoveries; whilst these latter are diminished in their estimation by\r\nsuch an association.\r\n\r\nI have stated this distinction, because I think it a just one; but the\r\npublic would have little cause of complaint if this were the only ground\r\nof objection to the mode of appropriating the Society's medals. The\r\nfirst objection to be noticed, is the indistinct manner in which the\r\nobject for which the medals are awarded is sometimes specified. A medal\r\nis given to A. B. \"for his various papers.\"\r\n\r\nThere are cases, few perhaps in number, where such a reason may be\r\nadmissible; but it is impossible not to perceive the weakness of those\r\nwho judge these matters legibly written in the phrase, \"and for his\r\nvarious other communications,\" which comes in as the frequent tail-piece\r\nto these awards. With a diffidence in their own powers, which might be\r\nmore admired if it were more frequently expressed, the Council think to\r\nescape through this loop-hole, should the propriety of their judgment\r\non the main point be called in question. Thus, even the discovery which\r\nmade chemistry a science, has attached to it in their award this feeble\r\nappendage.\r\n\r\nIt has been objected to the Royal Society, that their medals have been\r\ntoo much confined to a certain set. When the Royal medals were added to\r\ntheir patronage, the past distribution of the Copley medals, furnished\r\ngrounds to some of the journals to predict the future possessors of\r\nthe new ones. I shall, doubtless, be told that the Council of the Royal\r\nSociety are persons of such high feeling, that it is impossible to\r\nsuppose their decision could be influenced by any personal motives. As I\r\nmay not have had sufficient opportunities, during the short time I was\r\na member of that Council, to enable me to form a fair estimate, I shall\r\navail myself of the judgment of one, from whom no one will be inclined\r\nto appeal, who knew it long and intimately, and who expressed his\r\nopinion deliberately and solemnly.\r\n\r\nThe late Dr. Wollaston attached, as a condition to be observed in the\r\ndistribution of the interest of his munificent gift of 2,000L. to the\r\nRoyal Society, the following clause:--\"And I hereby empower the said\r\nPresident, Council, and Fellows, after my decease, in furtherance of the\r\nabove declared objects of the trust, to apply the said dividends to aid\r\nor reward any individual or individuals of any country, SAVING ONLY\r\nTHAT NO PERSON BEING A MEMBER OF THE COUNCIL FOR THE TIME BEING, SHALL\r\nRECEIVE OR PARTAKE OF SUCH REWARD.\"\r\n\r\nAnother improvement which might be suggested, is, that it is generally\r\ninexpedient to vote a medal until the paper which contains the discovery\r\nis at least read to the Society; perhaps even it might not be quite\r\nunreasonable to wish that it should have been printed, and consequently\r\nhave been perused by some few of those who have to decide on its merits.\r\nThese trifles have not always been attended to; and even so lately as\r\nthe last year, they escaped the notice of the President and his Council.\r\nThe Society was, however, indebted to the good sense of Mr. Faraday, who\r\ndeclined the proffered medal; and thus relieved us from one additional\r\ncharge of precipitancy. [When this hasty adjudication was thus put\r\na stop to, one of the members of the Council inquired, whether, as a\r\nCopley medal must by the will be annually given, some other person might\r\nnot be found deserving of it. To which the Secretary replied, \"We do\r\nnot intend to give any this year.\" All further discussion was thus\r\nsilenced.]\r\n\r\nPerhaps, also, as the Council are on some occasions apt to be oblivious,\r\nit might be convenient that the President should read, previously to the\r\naward of any medals or to the decision of any other important subjects,\r\nthe statutes relating to them. He might perhaps propitiate their\r\nattention to them, by stating, HOW MUCH IT IMPORTETH TO THE CONSISTENCY\r\nOF THE COUNCIL TO BE ACQUAINTED WITH THE LAWS ON WHICH THEY ARE ABOUT TO\r\nDECIDE.\r\n\r\nIf those who have been conversant with the internal management of the\r\nCouncil, would communicate their information, something curious might\r\nperhaps be learned respecting a few of these medals. Concerning those\r\nof which I have had good means of information, I shall merely state--of\r\nthree of them--that whatever may have been the official reasons for\r\ntheir award, I had ample reasons to convince me of the following being\r\nthe true causes:--\r\n\r\nFirst.--A medal was given to A, at a peculiarly inappropriate\r\ntime--BECAUSE HE HAD NOT HAD ONE BEFORE.\r\n\r\nSecond.--Subsequently a medal was given to B, in order TO DESTROY THE\r\nIMPRESSION WHICH THE AWARD OF THE MEDAL TO A HAD MADE ON THE PUBLIC THE\r\nPRECEDING YEAR.\r\n\r\nThird.--A medal was given to C, \"BECAUSE WE THINK HE HAS BEEN ILL USED.\"\r\n\r\nI will now enter on an examination of one of their awards, which\r\nwas peculiarly injudicious. I allude to that concerning the mode of\r\nrendering platina malleable. Respecting, as I did, the illustrious\r\nphilosopher who invented the art, and who has left many other claims\r\nto the gratitude of mankind, I esteem it no disrespect to his memory to\r\nplace that subject in its proper light.\r\n\r\nAn invention in science or in art, may justly be considered as\r\npossessing the rights of property in the highest degree. The lands\r\nwe inherit from our fathers, were cultivated ere they were born, and\r\nyielded produce before they were cultivated. The products of genius are\r\nthe actual creations of the individual; and, after yielding profit or\r\nhonour to him, they remain the permanent endowments of the human race.\r\nIf the institutions of our country, and the opinions of society, support\r\nus fully in the absolute disposal of our fields, of which we can, by\r\nthe laws of nature, be only the transitory possessors, who shall justly\r\nrestrict our discretion in the disposal of those richer possessions, the\r\nproducts of intellectual exertion?\r\n\r\nTwo courses are open to those individuals who are thus endowed with\r\nNature's wealth. They may lock up in their own bosoms the mysteries they\r\nhave penetrated, and by applying their knowledge to the production of\r\nsome substance in demand in commerce, thus minister to the wants or\r\ncomforts of their species, whilst they reap in pecuniary profit the\r\nlegitimate reward of their exertions.\r\n\r\nIt is open to them, on the other hand, to disclose the secret they have\r\ntorn from Nature, and by allowing mankind to participate with them, to\r\nclaim at once that splendid reputation which is rarely refused to the\r\ninventors of valuable discoveries in the arts of life.\r\n\r\nThe two courses are rarely compatible, only indeed when the discoverer,\r\nhaving published his process, enters into equal competition with other\r\nmanufacturers.\r\n\r\nIf an individual adopt the first of these courses, and retaining his\r\nsecret, it perish with him, the world have no right to complain. During\r\nhis life, they profited by his knowledge, and are better off than if the\r\nphilosopher had not existed.\r\n\r\nMonopolies, under the name of patents, have been devised to assist and\r\nreward those who have chosen the line of pecuniary profit. Honorary\r\nrewards and medals have been the feeble expressions of the sentiments\r\nof mankind towards those who have preferred the other course. But these\r\nhave been, and should always be, kept completely distinct. [It is a\r\ncondition with the Society of Arts, never to give a reward to any thing\r\nfor which a patent has been, or is to be, taken out.]\r\n\r\nLet us now consider the case of platina. A new process was discovered of\r\nrendering it malleable, and the mere circumstance of so large a quantity\r\nhaving been sent into the market, was a positive benefit, of no ordinary\r\nmagnitude, to many of the arts. The discoverer of this valuable process\r\nselected that course for which no reasonable man could blame him;\r\nand from some circumstance, or perhaps from accident, he preserved no\r\nwritten record of the manipulations. Had Providence appointed for that\r\ndisorder, which terminated too fatally, a more rapid career, all the\r\nknowledge he had acquired from the long attention he had devoted to the\r\nsubject, would have been lost to mankind. The hand of a friend recorded\r\nthe directions of the expiring philosopher, whose anxiety to render\r\nuseful even his unfinished speculations, proves that the previous\r\nomission was most probably accidental.\r\n\r\nUnder such circumstances it was published to the world in the\r\nTransactions of the Royal Society. But what could induce that body\r\nto bestow on it their medal? To talk of adding lustre to the name of\r\nWollaston by their medal, is to talk idly. They must have done it then\r\nas an example, as a stimulus to urge future inquiries in the career of\r\ndiscovery. But did they wish discoveries to be so endangered?\r\n\r\nThe discoveries of Professor Mitscherlick, of Berlin, had long been\r\nconsidered, by a few members of the Society, as having strong claims on\r\none of its honorary rewards; but difficulties had arisen, from so few\r\nmembers of the Council having any knowledge of discoveries which had\r\nlong been familiar to Europe. The Council were just on the point of\r\ndoing justice to the merits of the Prussian philosopher, when it was\r\nsuggested that its medal should be given to Dr. Wollaston, and they\r\nimmediately altered their intention, and thus enabled themselves to\r\nreserve their medal to Professor Mitscherlick for another year; at\r\nwhich period, for aught they knew, his discoveries might possess the\r\nadditional merit of having been made prior to the limit allowed by their\r\nregulations. That medal was, in fact, voted at a meeting, at which no\r\none member present was at all conversant with the subjects rewarded. I\r\nshall, however, say no more on this subject. They erred from feeling,\r\nan error so very rare with them, that it might be pardoned even for its\r\nsingularity.\r\n\r\nI will, however, add one word to those whose censures have been unjustly\r\ndealt, to those who have reproached the philosopher for receiving\r\npecuniary advantage from his inventions.\r\n\r\nAmongst the many and varied contrivances for the demands of science,\r\nor the arts of life, with which we were enriched by the genius of\r\nWollaston, was it too much to allow him to retain, during his fleeting\r\ncareer, one out of the multitude, to furnish that: pecuniary supply,\r\nwithout which, the man will want food for his body, and the philosopher\r\nbe destitute of tools for his inventions? Had he been, as, from the rank\r\nhe held in science, he certainly would have been in other kingdoms, rich\r\nin the honours his country could bestow, and receiving from her a reward\r\nin some measure commensurate with his deserts,--then, indeed, there\r\nmight have been reason for that reproach; but I am convinced that,\r\nin such circumstances, the philosopher would have balanced, with no\r\n\"niggard\" hand, the claims of his country, and would have given to it,\r\nunreservedly, the produce of his powerful mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION 9. OF THE FAIRCHILD LECTURE.\r\n\r\nMr. Fairchild left by will twenty-five pounds to the Royal Society. This\r\nwas increased by several subscriptions, and 100L. 3 per cent. South\r\nSea Annuities was purchased, the interest of which was to be devoted\r\nannually to pay for a sermon to be preached at St.Leonard's, Shoreditch.\r\n\r\nFew members of the Society, perhaps, are aware, either of the bequest or\r\nof its annual payment. I shall merely observe, that for five years,\r\nfrom 1800 to 1804, it was regularly given to Mr. Ascough; and that for\r\ntwenty-six years past, it has been as regularly given to the Rev. Mr.\r\nEllis.\r\n\r\nThe annual amount is too trifling to stimulate to any extraordinary\r\nexertions; yet, small as it is, it might, if properly applied, be\r\nproductive of much advantage to religion, and of great honour to the\r\nSociety. For this purpose, it would be desirable that it should be\r\ndelivered at some church or chapel, more likely to be attended by\r\nmembers of the Royal Society. Notice of it should be given at the place\r\nof worship appointed, at least a week previous to its delivery, and at\r\nthe two preceding weekly meetings of the Royal Society. The name of the\r\ngentleman nominated for that year, and the church at which the sermon is\r\nto be preached, should be stated.\r\n\r\nWith this publicity attending it, and by a judicious selection of the\r\nfirst two or three gentlemen appointed to deliver it, it would soon\r\nbe esteemed an honour to be invited to compose such a lecture, and the\r\nSociety might always find in its numerous list of members or aspirants,\r\npersons well qualified to fulfil a task as beneficial for the promotion\r\nof true religion, as it ever must be for the interest of science. I am\r\ntempted to believe that such a course would call forth exertions of the\r\nmost valuable character, as well as give additional circulation to what\r\nis already done on that subject.\r\n\r\nThe geological speculations which have been adduced, perhaps with too\r\nmuch haste by some, as according with the Mosaic history, and by\r\nothers, as inconsistent with its truth, would, if this subject had been\r\nattentively considered, have been allowed to remain until the fullest\r\nand freest inquiry had irrevocably fixed their claim to the character\r\nof indisputable facts. But, I will not press this subject further on\r\nmy reader's attention, lest he should think I am myself delivering the\r\nlecture. All that I could have said on this point has been so much more\r\nably stated by one whose enlightened view of geological science has\r\ntaken away some difficulties from its cultivators, and, I hope, removed\r\na stumbling-block from many respectable individuals, that I should only\r\nweaken by adding to the argument. [I allude to the critique of Dr. Ure's\r\nGeology in the British Review, for July, 1829; an Essay, equally worthy\r\nof a philosopher and a Christian.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION 10. OF THE CROONIAN LECTURE.\r\n\r\nThe payment [Three pounds.] for this Lecture, like that of the\r\npreceding, is small. It was instituted by Dr. Croone, for an annual\r\nessay on the subject of Muscular Motion. It is a little to be regretted,\r\nthat it should have been so restricted; and perhaps its founder, had he\r\nforeseen the routine into which it has dwindled, might have endeavoured\r\nto preserve it, by affording it a wider range.\r\n\r\nBy giving it to a variety of individuals, competition might have been\r\ncreated, and many young anatomists have been induced to direct their\r\nattention to the favourite inquiry of the founder of the Lecture;\r\nbut from causes which need not here be traced, this has not been the\r\ncustom--one individual has monopolized it year after year, and it seems,\r\nlike the Fairchild Lecture, rather to have been regarded as a pension.\r\nThere have, however, been some intervals; and we are still under\r\nobligations to those who have supported THE SYSTEM, for not appointing\r\nSir Everard Home to read the Croonian Lecture twenty years in\r\nSUCCESSION. Had it been otherwise, we might have heard of vested rights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION 11. OF THE CAUSES OF THE PRESENT STATE OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY.\r\n\r\nThe best friends of the Royal Society have long admitted, whilst they\r\nregretted, its declining fame; and even those who support whatever\r\nexists, begin a little to doubt whether it might not possibly be\r\namended.\r\n\r\nThe great and leading cause of the present state to which the Royal\r\nSociety is reduced, may be traced to years of misrule to which it has\r\nbeen submitted. In order to understand this, it will be necessary\r\nto explain the nature of that misrule, and the means employed in\r\nperpetuating it.\r\n\r\nIt is known, that by the statutes, the body of the Society have the\r\npower of electing, annually, their President, Officers, and Council;\r\nand it is also well known, that this is a merely nominal power, and\r\nthat printed lists are prepared and put into the hands of the members\r\non their entering the room, and thus passed into the balloting box. If\r\nthese lists were, as in other scientific societies, openly discussed in\r\nthe Council, and then offered by them as recommendations to the Society,\r\nlittle inconvenience would arise; but the fact is, that they are private\r\nnominations by the President, usually without notice, to the Council,\r\nand all the supporters of the system which I am criticizing, endeavour\r\nto uphold the right of this nomination in the President, and prevent or\r\ndiscourage any alteration.\r\n\r\nThe Society has, for years, been managed by a PARTY, or COTERIE, or\r\nby whatever other name may be most fit to designate a combination of\r\npersons, united by no expressed compact or written regulations, but who\r\nact together from a community of principles. That each individual has\r\ninvariably supported all the measures of the party, is by no means the\r\ncase; and whilst instances of opposition amongst them have been very\r\nrare, a silent resignation to circumstances has been the most usual mode\r\nof meeting measures they disapproved. The great object of this, as of\r\nall other parties, has been to maintain itself in power, and to divide,\r\nas far as it could, all the good things amongst its members. It has\r\nusually consisted of persons of very moderate talent, who have had\r\nthe prudence, whenever they could, to associate with themselves other\r\nmembers of greater ability, provided these latter would not oppose the\r\nsystem, and would thus lend to it the sanction of their name. The party\r\nhave always praised each other most highly--have invariably opposed all\r\nimprovements in the Society, all change in the mode of management;\r\nand have maintained, that all those who wished for any alteration were\r\nfactious; and, when they discovered any symptoms of independence and\r\ninquiry breaking out in any member of the Council, they have displaced\r\nhim as soon as they decently could.\r\n\r\nOf the arguments employed by those who support the SYSTEM OF MANAGEMENT\r\nby which the Royal Society is governed, I shall give a few samples:\r\nrefutation is rendered quite unnecessary--juxta-position is\r\nalone requisite. If any member, seeing an improper appointment in\r\ncontemplation, or any abuse in the management of the affairs of the\r\nSociety continued, raise a voice against it, the ready answer is, Why\r\nshould you interfere? it may not be quite the thing you approve; but it\r\nis no affair of yours.--If, on the other hand, it do relate to himself,\r\nthe reply is equally ready. It is immediately urged: The question is\r\nof a personal nature; you are the last person who ought to bring it\r\nforward; you are yourself interested. If any member of the Society,\r\nfeeling annoyed at the neglect, or hurt by the injuries or insults of\r\nthe Council, show signs of remonstrance, it is immediately suggested to\r\nhim that he is irritated, and ought to wait until his feelings subside,\r\nand he can judge more coolly on the subject; whilst with becoming\r\ncandour they admit the ill-treatment, but urge forbearance. If, after\r\nan interval, when reflection has had ample time to operate, the offence\r\nseems great as at first, or the insult appears unmitigated by any\r\ncircumstances on which memory can dwell,--if it is then brought forward,\r\nthe immediate answer is, The affair is out of date--the thing is gone\r\nby--it is too late to call in question a transaction so long past. Thus,\r\nif a man is interested personally, he is unfit to question an abuse;\r\nif he is not, is it probable that he will question it? and if,\r\nnotwithstanding this, he do so, then he is to be accounted a meddler. If\r\nhe is insulted, and complain, he is told to wait until he is cool;\r\nand when that period arrives, he is then told he is too late. If his\r\nremonstrance relates to the alteration of laws which are never referred\r\nto, or only known by their repeated breach, he is told that any\r\nalteration is useless; it is perfectly well known that they are never\r\nadhered to. If it relate to the impolicy of any regulations attaching to\r\nan office, he is immediately answered, that that is a personal question,\r\nin which it is impossible to interfere--the officer, it seems, is\r\nconsidered to have not merely a vested right to the continuance of every\r\nabuse, but an interest in transmitting it unimpaired to his successors.\r\n\r\nIn the same spirit I have heard errors of calculation or observation\r\ndefended. If small errors occur, it is said that they are too trifling\r\nto be of any importance. If larger errors are pointed out, it is\r\nimmediately contended that they can deceive nobody, because of their\r\nmagnitude. Perhaps it might be of some use, if the Council would oblige\r\nthe world with their SCALE of ERROR, with illustrations from some of the\r\nmost RECENT and APPROVED works, and would favour the uninformed with\r\nthe orthodox creed upon all grades, from that which baffles the human\r\nfaculties to detect, up to that which becomes innocuous from its size.\r\n\r\nThe offices connected with the Royal Society are few in number, and\r\ntheir emolument small in amount; but the proper disposition of them\r\nis, nevertheless, of great importance to the Society, and was so to the\r\nscience of England.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the President, having in effect the absolute\r\nnomination of the whole Council, could each year introduce a few\r\ngentlemen, whose only qualification to sit on it would be the high\r\nopinion they must necessarily entertain of the penetration of him who\r\ncould discover their scientific merits. He might also place in the list\r\na few nobles or officials, just to gild it. Neither of these classes\r\nwould put any troublesome questions, and one of them might be employed,\r\nfrom its station in society, to check any that might be proposed by\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nWith these ingredients, added to the regular train of the party, and a\r\nstar or two of science to shed lustre over the whole, a very manageable\r\nCouncil might be formed; and such has been its frequent composition.\r\n\r\nThe duties of the Secretaries, when well executed, are laborious,\r\nalthough not in this respect equal to those of the same officers who, in\r\nseveral societies, give their gratuitous aid; and their labours are much\r\nlightened by the Assistant Secretary and his clerk. The following are\r\ntheir salaries:--\r\n\r\n     The Senior Secretary ........... 105L.\r\n     The Junior Secretary, 105L........ )\r\n     5L. for making Index to Phil. Trans... ) 110L.\r\n     The Foreign Secretary...........  20L.\r\n\r\nNow it is not customary to change these annually; and as these offices\r\nare amongst the \"loaves and fishes\" they are generally given by the\r\nPresident to some staunch supporters of the system. They have frequently\r\nbeen bestowed, with very little consideration for the interest, or even\r\nfor the dignity of the Society. To notice only one instance: the late\r\nSir Joseph Banks appointed a gentleman who remained for years in\r\nthat situation, although he was confessedly ignorant of every subject\r\nconnected with the pursuits of the Society. I will, however, do justice\r\nto his memory, by saying that his respectability was preserved\r\nunder such circumstances, by the most candid admission of the fact,\r\naccompanied by a store of other knowledge unfortunately quite foreign to\r\nthe pursuits of the Society; and I will add, that I regretted to see him\r\ninsulted by one President in a situation improperly given to him by a\r\nformer.\r\n\r\nNext in order come the Vice-Presidents, who are appointed by the\r\nPresident; and in this respect the present practice is not inconvenient.\r\n\r\nThe case, however, is widely different with the office of Treasurer. The\r\nPresident ought not to usurp the power of his appointment, which ought,\r\nafter serious discussion by the Council, to be made by the Society at\r\nlarge.\r\n\r\nBesides the three Secretaries, there is an Assistant Secretary,\r\nand recently another has been added, who may perhaps be called a\r\nSub-assistant Secretary. All these places furnish patronage to the\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\nLet us now look at the occasional patronage of the President, arising\r\nfrom offices not belonging to the Society. He is, EX OFFICIO, a Trustee\r\nof the British Museum; and it may seem harsh to maintain that he is not\r\na fit person to hold such a situation. It is no theoretical view, but it\r\nis the EXPERIENCE of the past which justifies the assertion; and I\r\nfear that unless he has the sole responsibility for some specific\r\nappointments, and unless his judgment is sharpened by the fear of public\r\ndiscussion, a President of the Royal Society, in the Board-room of the\r\nBritish Museum, is quite as likely as another person to sacrifice his\r\npublic duty to the influence of power, or to private friendship. With\r\nrespect to the merits of that Institution, I have no inclination at\r\npresent to inquire: but when it is considered that there is at this\r\nmoment attached to it no one whose observations or whose writings have\r\nplaced him even in the second rank amongst the naturalists of Europe,\r\nthe President of the Royal Society has given some grounds for the remark\r\nmade by several members of the Society, that he is a little too much\r\nsurrounded by the officers of a body who may reasonably be supposed to\r\nentertain towards him feelings either of gratitude or expectation.\r\n[It will be remembered that the name of Mr. Robert Brown has been but\r\nrecently attached to the British Museum, and that it is to be attributed\r\nto his possessing a life interest in the valuable collection of the late\r\nSir Joseph Banks.]\r\n\r\nThe late Board of Longitude was another source of patronage, which,\r\nalthough now abolished, it may be useful to hint at.\r\n\r\nThere were three members to be appointed by the Royal Society: these\r\nwere honorary, and, as no salary was attached, it might have been\r\nexpected that this limited number of appointments would have been given\r\nin all cases to persons qualified for them. But no: it was convenient\r\nto pay compliments; and Lord Colchester, whose talents and knowledge\r\ninsured him respect as Speaker of the House of Commons, or as a\r\nBritish nobleman, was placed for years in the situation as one of the\r\nCommissioners of the Board of Longitude, for which every competent judge\r\nknew him to be wholly unfit. What was the return which he made for this\r\nindulgence? Little informed respecting the feelings of the Society, and\r\nprobably misinformed by the party whose influence had placed him there,\r\nhe saved them in the day of their peril.\r\n\r\nWhen the state of the Society had reached such a point that many of\r\nthe more scientific members felt that some amendment was absolutely\r\nnecessary to its respectability, a committee was formed to suggest to\r\nthe Council such improvements as they might consider it expedient to\r\ndiscuss. [Amongst the names of the persons composing this Committee,\r\nwhich was proposed by Mr. South, were those of Dr. Wollaston and\r\nMr. Herschel.] The Council received their report at the close of the\r\nsession; and in recording it on the journals, they made an appeal to the\r\nCouncil for the ensuing year to bestow on it \"THEIR EARLIEST AND MOST\r\nSERIOUS ATTENTION.\"\r\n\r\nNow when the party, to whose government some of these improvements would\r\nhave been a death-warrant, found that the subject was likely to be taken\r\nup in the Council, they were in dismay: but the learned and grateful\r\npeer came to their assistance, and aided Mr. Davies Gilbert in getting\r\nrid of these improvements completely.\r\n\r\nIt has been the fashion to maintain that all classes of the Royal\r\nSociety should be represented in the Council, and consequently that a\r\npeer or two should find a place amongst them. Those who are most adverse\r\nto this doctrine would perhaps be the most anxious to render this\r\ntribute to any one really employing his time, his talents, or his rank\r\nin advancing the cause of science. But when a nobleman, unversed in our\r\npursuits, will condescend to use the influence of his station in aiding\r\na President to stifle, WITHOUT DISCUSSION, propositions recommended\r\nfor consideration by some of the most highly gifted members of the\r\nSociety,--those who doubt the propriety of the principle may reasonably\r\nbe pardoned for the disgust they must necessarily entertain for the\r\npractical abuse to which it leads.\r\n\r\nOf the other three Commissioners, who received each a hundred a-year,\r\nalthough the nomination was, in point of form, in the Admiralty, yet\r\nit was well known that the President of the Royal Society did, in fact,\r\nalways name them. Of these I will only mention one fact. The late Sir\r\nJoseph Banks assigned to me as a reason why I need not expect to be\r\nappointed, (as he had held out to me at a former period when I had\r\nspoken to him on the subject) that I had taken a prominent part in the\r\nformation of the ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY. I am proud of the part I did take\r\nin establishing that Society, although an undue share of its honour was\r\nassigned to me by the President.\r\n\r\nIt may, perhaps, be inquired, why I publish this fact at this distance\r\nof time? I answer, that I stated it publicly at the Council of the\r\nAstronomical Society;--that I always talked of it publicly and openly at\r\nthe time;--that I purposely communicated it to each succeeding President\r\nof the Royal Society; and that, although some may have forgotten the\r\ncommunications I made at the time, there are others who remember them\r\nwell.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the late Board of Longitude received 300L., and 200L.\r\nmore, as Superintendent of the Nautical Almanac.\r\n\r\nAnother situation, in the patronage of which the President is known to\r\nhave considerable influence, is that of Astronomer Royal; and it is\r\nto be observed, that he is kept in the Council as much as possible,\r\nnotwithstanding the nature of his duties.\r\n\r\nOf the three appointments of 100L. a-year each, which have been\r\ninstituted since the abolition of the Board of Longitude, the President\r\nis supposed to have the control, thus making him quite sure of the\r\nobedience of his Council.\r\n\r\nBesides these sources of patronage, there are other incidental occasions\r\non which Government apply to the Royal Society to recommend proper\r\npersons to make particular experiments or observations; and, although I\r\nam far from supposing that these are in many instances given to persons\r\nthe second or third best qualified for them, yet they deserve to be\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION 12. OF THE PLAN FOR REFORMING THE SOCIETY.\r\n\r\nThe indiscriminate admission of every candidate became at last so\r\nnotorious, even beyond the pale of the Society, that some of the members\r\nbegan to perceive the inconveniences to which it led. This feeling,\r\ntogether with a conviction that other improvements were necessary to\r\nre-establish the Society in public opinion, induced several of the most\r\nactive members to wish for some reform in its laws and proceedings;\r\nand a Committee was appointed to consider the subject. It was perfectly\r\nunderstood, that the object of this Committee was to inquire,--First, as\r\nto the means and propriety of limiting the numbers of this Society; and\r\nthen, as to other changes which they might think beneficial. The names\r\nof the gentlemen composing this Committee were:--\r\n\r\n     Dr. Wollaston,           Mr. Herschel,\r\n     Dr. Young,               Mr. Babbage,\r\n     Mr. Davies Gilbert,      Captain Beaufort,\r\n     Mr. South,               Captain Kater.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the various improvements suggested was different in\r\nthe eyes of different members. The idea of rendering the Society so\r\nselect as to make it an object of ambition to men of science to be\r\nelected into it, was by no means new, as the following extract from the\r\nMinutes of the Council will prove:--\r\n\r\n\"MINUTES OF COUNCIL. August 27, 1674 Present,\r\n\r\n   Sir W. Petty, Vice-President,\r\n   Sir John Lowther,\r\n   Sir John Cutler,\r\n   Sir Christopher Wren,\r\n   Mr. Oldenburgh,\r\n   Sir Paul Neile.\r\n\r\n\"It was considered by this Council, that to make the Society prosper,\r\ngood experiments must be in the first place provided to make the\r\nweekly meetings considerable, and that the expenses for making these\r\nexperiments must be secured by legal subscriptions for paying the\r\ncontributors; which done, the Council might then with confidence proceed\r\nto the EJECTION OF USELESS FELLOWS.\"\r\n\r\nThe reformers of modern times were less energetic in the measures they\r\nrecommended. Dr. Wollaston and some others thought the limitation of\r\nthe numbers of the Society to be the most essential point, and 400 was\r\nsuggested as a proper number to be recommended, in case a limitation\r\nshould be ultimately resolved upon. I confess, such a limit did not\r\nappear to me to bring great advantages, especially when I reflected\r\nhow long a time must have elapsed before the 714 members of the Society\r\ncould be reduced by death to that number. And I also thought that as\r\nlong as those who alone sustained the reputation of the Society by their\r\nwritings and discoveries should be admitted into it on precisely\r\nthe same terms, and on the payment of the same sum of money as other\r\ngentlemen who contributed only with their purse, it could never be an\r\nobject of ambition to any man of science to be enrolled on its list.\r\n\r\nWith this view, and also to assist those who wished for a limitation, I\r\nsuggested a plan extremely simple in its nature, and which would become\r\neffective immediately. I proposed that, in the printed list of the Royal\r\nSociety, a star should be placed against the name of each Fellow who\r\nhad contributed two or more papers which had been printed in the\r\nTransactions, or that such a list should be printed separately at the\r\nend.\r\n\r\nAt that period there were 109 living members who had contributed papers\r\nto the Transactions, and they were thus arranged:\r\n\r\n     37 Contributors of.. 1 paper\r\n     21.......... 2 papers\r\n     19.......... 3 ditto\r\n     5 .......... 4 ditto\r\n     3 .......... 5 ditto\r\n     3 .......... 6 ditto\r\n     12....  from 7 to 12 ditto\r\n     14... of more than 12 papers.\r\n\r\n100 Contributing Fellows of the Royal Society. 589 Papers contributed by\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nNow the immediate effect of printing such a list would be the division\r\nof the Society into two classes. Supposing two or more papers necessary\r\nfor placing a Fellow in the first class, that class would only consist\r\nof seventy-two members, which is nearly the same as the number of those\r\nof the Institute of France. If only those who had contributed three or\r\nmore were admitted, then this class would be reduced to fifty-one. In\r\neither of these cases it would obviously become a matter of ambition\r\nto belong to the first class; and a more minute investigation into the\r\nvalue of each paper would naturally take place before it was admitted\r\ninto the Transactions. Or it might be established that such papers only\r\nshould be allowed to count, as the Committee, who reported them as fit\r\nto be printed, should also certify. The great objection made to such\r\nan arrangement was, that it would be displeasing to the rest of the\r\nSociety, and that they had a vested right (having entered the Society\r\nwhen no distinction was made in the lists) to have them always continued\r\nwithout one.\r\n\r\nWithout replying to this shadow of an argument of vested rights, I will\r\nonly remark that he who maintains this view pays a very ill compliment\r\nto the remaining 600 members of the Royal Society; since he does,\r\nin truth, maintain that those gentlemen who, from their position,\r\naccidentally derive reputation which does not belong to them, are\r\nunwilling, when the circumstance is pointed out, to allow the world\r\nto assign it to those who have fairly won it; or else that they\r\nare incapable of producing any thing worthy of being printed in the\r\nTransactions of the Royal Society. Lightly as the conduct of the\r\nSociety, as a body, has compelled me to think of it, I do not think so\r\nill of the personal character of its members as to believe that if the\r\nquestion were fairly stated to them, many would object to it.\r\n\r\nAmongst the alterations which I considered most necessary to the\r\nrenovation of the Society, was the recommendation, by the expiring\r\nCouncil, of those whom they thought most eligible for that of the\r\nensuing year.\r\n\r\nThe system which had got into practice was radically bad: it is\r\nimpossible to have an INDEPENDENT Council if it is named by ONE PERSON.\r\nOur statutes were framed with especial regard to securing the fitness\r\nof the members elected to serve in the Council; and the President is\r\ndirected, by those statutes, at the two ordinary meetings previous to\r\nthe anniversary, to give notice of the elections, and \"to declare how\r\nmuch it importeth the good of the Society that such persons may be\r\nchosen into the Council as are most likely to attend the meetings and\r\nbusiness of the Council, and out of whom may be made the best choice of\r\na President and other officers.\" This is regularly done; and, in mockery\r\nof the wisdom of our ancestors, the President has perhaps in his pocket\r\nthe list of the future Council he has already fixed upon.\r\n\r\nIn some other Societies, great advantage is found to arise from the\r\ndiscussion of the proper persons to be recommended to the Society for\r\nthe Council of the next year. A list is prepared, by the Secretary, of\r\nthe old Council, and against each name is placed the number of times\r\nhe has attended the meetings of the Council. Those whose attendance has\r\nbeen least frequent are presumed to be otherwise engaged, unless absence\r\nfrom London, or engagement in some pursuit connected with the Society,\r\nare known to have interfered. Those members who have been on the Council\r\nthe number of years which is usually allowed, added to those who go out\r\nby their own wish, and by non-attendance, are, generally, more in number\r\nthan can be spared; and the question is never, who shall retire?--but,\r\nwho, out of the rest of the Society, is most likely to work, if placed\r\non the Council?\r\n\r\nIf any difference of opinion should exist in a society, it is always of\r\ngreat importance to its prosperity to have both opinions represented\r\nin the Council. In this age of discussion it is impossible to stifle\r\nopinions; and if they are not represented in the Council, there is some\r\nchance of their being brought before the general body, or, at last, even\r\nbefore the public. It is certainly an advantage that questions should be\r\nput, and even that debates should take place on the days appropriated\r\nto the anniversaries of societies. This is the best check to the\r\ncommencement of irregularities; and a suspicion may reasonably be\r\nentertained of those who endeavour to suppress inquiry.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, debates respecting the affairs of the Society should\r\nnever be entered on at the ordinary meetings, as they interrupt its\r\nbusiness, and only a partial attendance can be expected. That the\r\nconduct of those who have latterly managed the Royal Society has not\r\nled to such discussions, is to be attributed more to the forbearance of\r\nthose who disapprove of the line of conduct they have pursued, than to\r\nthe discretion of the party in not giving them cause.\r\n\r\nThe public is the last tribunal; one to which nothing but strong\r\nnecessity should induce an appeal. There are, however, advantages in it\r\nwhich may, in some cases, render it better than a public discussion at\r\nthe anniversary. When the cause of complaint is a system rather than any\r\none great grievance, it may be necessary to enter more into detail than\r\na speech will permit; also the printed statement and arguments will\r\nprobably come under the consideration of a larger number of the members.\r\nAnother and a considerable benefit is, that there is much less danger\r\nof any expression of temper interrupting or injuring the arguments\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\nThere were other points suggested, but I shall subjoin the Report of the\r\nCommittee:--\r\n\r\nREPORT OF THE COMMITTEE APPOINTED TO CONSIDER THE BEST MEANS OF LIMITING\r\nTHE MEMBERS ADMITTED INTO THE ROYAL SOCIETY, AS WELL AS TO MAKE SUCH\r\nSUGGESTIONS ON THAT SUBJECT AS MAY SEEM TO THEM CONDUCIVE TO THE WELFARE\r\nOF THE SOCIETY.\r\n\r\nYour Committee having maturely considered the resolution of the Council\r\nunder which they have been appointed; and having satisfied themselves\r\nthat the progressive increase of the Society has been in a much higher\r\nratio than the progressive increase of population, or the general growth\r\nof knowledge, or the extension of those sciences which it has been\r\nthe great object of the Society to promote, they have agreed to the\r\nfollowing Report:--\r\n\r\nYour Committee assume as indisputable propositions, that the utility\r\nof the Society is in direct proportion to its respectability. That\r\nits respectability can only be secured by its comprising men of high\r\nphilosophical eminence; and that the obvious means of associating\r\npersons of this eminence will be the public conviction, that to belong\r\nto the Society is an honour. Your Committee, therefore, think themselves\r\nfully borne out in the conclusion, that it would be expedient to limit\r\nthe Society to such a number as should be a fair representation of the\r\ntalent of the country; the consequence of which will be, that every\r\nvacancy would become an object of competition among persons of\r\nacknowledged merit.\r\n\r\nFrom the returns which have been laid on your table, of the Fellows who\r\nhave contributed papers, and from the best estimate they can make of the\r\npersons without doors who are engaged in the active pursuit of science,\r\nyour Committee feel justified in recommending that those limits should\r\nbe fixed at four hundred, exclusive of foreign members, and of such\r\nroyal personages as it may be thought proper to admit.\r\n\r\nAs many years must elapse before the present number of seven hundred and\r\nfourteen can be reduced to those limits by the course of nature, and as\r\nit would be prejudicial to the interests of the Society and of science,\r\nthat no fresh accessions should take place during that long period, your\r\nCommittee would further recommend, that till that event takes place,\r\nfour new members should be annually admitted.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the manner of admission, your Committee are of opinion,\r\nthat there are several inconveniences in the present mode of proceeding\r\nto a single ballot upon each certificate, according to its seniority.\r\nIf the above limitation should be adopted, it may be presumed, that for\r\nevery vacancy there will be many candidates; from amongst them, it must\r\nbe the general wish to select the most distinguished individuals; but to\r\naccomplish this, if the present system were to be continued, it would\r\nbe necessary to reject all those candidates whose certificates were of\r\nearlier date than theirs; a process not only extremely irritating,\r\nbut probably ineffectual from the want of unanimity. Your Committee,\r\ntherefore, most earnestly recommend, that one general election should\r\ntake place every year towards the end of the session, and that this\r\nshould be conducted on the same principles as the present annual\r\nelection of the Council and officers; VIZ. by having lists printed of\r\nall the candidates (whose certificates had been suspended for the usual\r\ntime,) in which lists each Fellow would mark the requisite number of\r\npersons.\r\n\r\nAs the charter, however, requires the concurrence of two-thirds of the\r\nFellows present, your Committee suggest, that after the choice has been\r\ndetermined by the plurality of votes by ballot in the above manner, the\r\nsuccessful candidates should be again submitted to a general vote, in\r\naccordance with the enactments of the said charter.\r\n\r\nIn concluding this part of the subject, your Committee beg leave\r\nto remark, that by the method now proposed, the invidious act of\r\nblackballing would cease, and with it all feelings of resentment and\r\nmortification; as the result of such an open competition could only be\r\nconstrued by the public into a fair preference of the superior claims of\r\nthe successful few, and not into a direct and disgraceful rejection of\r\nthe others.\r\n\r\nYour Committee are fully aware, that such a reduction in the usual\r\nadmissions would materially affect the pecuniary resources of the\r\nSociety; but they are at the same time convinced, that by a vigorous\r\neconomy its present income might be rendered adequate to all its real\r\nwants, and the aggregate expenditure might be considerably diminished by\r\nmany small but wholesome retrenchments.\r\n\r\nIt appears, from the accounts of last year, that although 1200L. was\r\nreceived for compositions, in addition to the standing income, and usual\r\ncontributions, &c., and although no money was invested, yet there was a\r\nbalance only of a few pounds at the end of the year. It further appears,\r\nthat 500L. was paid for the paper, 370L. for engravings, and nearly\r\n340L. for printing; and from those alarming facts, your Committee submit\r\nto your consideration, whether the expenditure might not be beneficially\r\ncontrolled by a standing Committee of Finance.\r\n\r\nIn obedience to the latter part of your resolution, your Committee now\r\nproceed to offer some further suggestions for your consideration.\r\nThey conceive that it would afford a beneficial stimulus to individual\r\nexertion, if the Fellows who have received the medals of the Society,\r\nand those who have repeatedly enriched its Transactions, were\r\ndistinguished by being collected into a separate and honourable list. It\r\nwould also be found, perhaps, not less a future incentive than an act of\r\nretrospective justice, if the names of all those illustrious Fellows who\r\nhave formerly obtained the medals, as well as of all those individuals\r\nwho have been large benefactors to the Society, were recorded at the end\r\nof the list. It would be a satisfactory addition likewise to the annual\r\nlist, if all those Fellows who have died, or had been admitted within\r\nthe preceding year, were regularly noticed. And your Committee think,\r\nthat these lists should always form part of the Transactions, and be\r\nstitched up with the last part of the volume.\r\n\r\nIt requires no argument to demonstrate that the well-being of the\r\nSociety mainly depends on the activity and integrity of its Council;\r\nand as their selection is unquestionably of paramount importance, your\r\nCommittee hope that our excellent President will not consider it any\r\nimpeachment of his impartiality, or any doubt of his zeal, if they\r\nventure to suggest, that the usual recommendation to the Society of\r\nproper members for the future Council should henceforth be considered as\r\na fit subject for the diligent and anxious deliberation of the expiring\r\nCouncil.\r\n\r\nThere is another point of great moment to the character of the Society,\r\nand to the dignified station it occupies among the learned associations\r\nof Europe; for its character abroad can only be appreciated by the\r\nnature and value of its Transactions. Your Committee allude to the\r\nimportant task of deciding on what papers should be published; and they\r\nare of opinion that it would be a material improvement on the present\r\nmode, if each paper were referred to a separate Committee, who should\r\nhave sufficient time given them to examine it carefully, who should be\r\nempowered to communicate on any doubtful parts with the author; and who\r\nshould report, not only their opinion, but the grounds on which that\r\nopinion is formed, for the ultimate decision of the Council.\r\n\r\nIf it should be thought fit to adopt the suggestions which your\r\nCommittee have now had the honour of proposing, they beg leave to move,\r\nthat another Committee be appointed, with directions to frame or to\r\nalter the necessary statutes, so that they may be in strict accordance\r\nwith the charters.\r\n\r\nIn concluding the Report, your Committee do not wish to disguise the\r\nmagnitude of some of the measures they have thought it their duty\r\nto propose; on the contrary, they would not only urge the fullest\r\ndiscussion of their expediency; but further, that if you should even be\r\nunanimously disposed to confirm them, your Committee would recommend,\r\nthat the several statutes, when they have been drawn up or modified,\r\nshould be only entered on your minutes, and not finally enacted.\r\nAll innovations in the constitution, or even the habits of the Royal\r\nSociety, should be scrutinized with the most jealous circumspection.\r\nIt is enough for the present Council to have traced the plan; let the\r\nCouncil of the ensuing sessions share the credit of carrying that plan\r\ninto effect.\r\n\r\nThis Report was presented to the Council very late in the session of\r\n1827, and on the 25th of June there occurs the following entry on the\r\ncouncil-book:--\r\n\r\n\"The Report of the Committee for considering the best means of limiting\r\nthe number of members, and such other suggestions as they may think\r\nconducive to the good of the Society, was received and read, and ordered\r\nto be entered on the minutes; and the Council, regarding the importance\r\nof the subject, and its bearings on the essential interests of the\r\nSociety, in conformity with the concluding paragraph, and considering\r\nalso the advanced stage of the session, recommend it to the most serious\r\nand early consideration of the Council for the ensuing year.\"\r\n\r\nThose who advocated these alterations, were in no hurry for their\r\nhasty adoption; they were aware of their magnitude, and anxious for the\r\nfullest investigation before one of them should be tried.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the concluding recommendation of the Committee did not\r\ncoincide with the views of Mr. Gilbert, whom the party had determined to\r\nmake their new President. That gentleman made such arrangements for the\r\nCouncil of the succeeding year, that when the question respecting the\r\nconsideration of the Report of that Committee was brought forward, it\r\nwas thrown aside in the manner I have stated. Thus a report, sanctioned\r\nby the names of such a committee, and recommended by one Council to\r\n\"THE MOST SERIOUS and EARLY consideration of the Council for the ensuing\r\nyear,\" was by that very Council rejected, without even the ceremony of\r\ndiscussing its merits. Was every individual recommendation it contained,\r\nnot merely unfit to be adopted, but so totally deficient in plausibility\r\nas to be utterly unworthy of discussion? Or did the President and his\r\nofficers feel, that their power rested on an insecure foundation, and\r\nthat they did not possess the confidence of the working members of the\r\nSociety?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V. OF OBSERVATIONS.\r\n\r\nThere are several reflections connected with the art of making\r\nobservations and experiments, which may be conveniently arranged in this\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION 1. OF MINUTE PRECISION.\r\n\r\nNo person will deny that the highest degree of attainable accuracy is an\r\nobject to be desired, and it is generally found that the last advances\r\ntowards precision require a greater devotion of time, labour, and\r\nexpense, than those which precede them. The first steps in the path of\r\ndiscovery, and the first approximate measures, are those which add most\r\nto the existing knowledge of mankind.\r\n\r\nThe extreme accuracy required in some of our modern inquiries has, in\r\nsome respects, had an unfortunate influence, by favouring the opinion,\r\nthat no experiments are valuable, unless the measures are most minute,\r\nand the accordance amongst them most perfect. It may, perhaps, be of\r\nsome use to show, that even with large instruments, and most practised\r\nobservers, this is but rarely the case. The following extract is taken\r\nfrom a representation made by the present Astronomer-Royal, to the\r\nCouncil of the Royal Society, on the advantages to be derived from the\r\nemployment of two mural circles:--\r\n\r\n\"That by observing, with two instruments, the same objects at the same\r\ntime, and in the same manner, we should be able to estimate how much of\r\nthat OCCASIONAL DISCORDANCE FROM THE MEAN, which attends EVEN THE\r\nMOST CAREFUL OBSERVATIONS, ought to be attributed to irregularity of\r\nrefraction, and how much to THE IMPERFECTIONS OF INSTRUMENTS.\"\r\n\r\nIn confirmation of this may be adduced the opinion of the late M.\r\nDelambre, which is the more important, from the statement it contains\r\nrelative to the necessity of publishing all the observations which have\r\nbeen made.\r\n\r\n\"Mais quelque soit le parti que l'on prefere, il me semble qu'on doit\r\ntout publier. Ces irregularites memes sont des faits qu'il importe de\r\nconnoitre. LES SOINS LES PLUS ATTENTIFS N'EN SAUROIENT PRESERVER LES\r\nOBSERVATEURS LES PLUS EXERCES, et celui qui ne produiroit que des angles\r\ntoujours parfaitment d'accord auroit ete singulierement bien servi\r\npar les circonstances ou ne seroit pas bien sincere.\"--BASE DU SYSTEME\r\nMETRIQUE, Discours Preliminaire, p. 158.\r\n\r\nThis desire for extreme accuracy has called away the attention of\r\nexperimenters from points of far greater importance, and it seems to\r\nhave been too much overlooked in the present day, that genius marks its\r\ntract, not by the observation of quantities inappreciable to any but the\r\nacutest senses, but by placing Nature in such circumstances, that she is\r\nforced to record her minutest variations on so magnified a scale, that\r\nan observer, possessing ordinary faculties, shall find them legibly\r\nwritten. He who can see portions of matter beyond the ken of the rest of\r\nhis species, confers an obligation on them, by recording what he sees;\r\nbut their knowledge depends both on his testimony and on his judgment.\r\nHe who contrives a method of rendering such atoms visible to ordinary\r\nobservers, communicates to mankind an instrument of discovery, and\r\nstamps his own observations with a character, alike independent of\r\ntestimony or of judgment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION 2. ON THE ART OF OBSERVING.\r\n\r\nThe remarks in this section are not proposed for the assistance of\r\nthose who are already observers, but are intended to show to persons not\r\nfamiliar with the subject, that in observations demanding no unrivalled\r\naccuracy, the principles of common sense may be safely trusted, and that\r\nany gentleman of liberal education may, by perseverance and attention,\r\nascertain the limits within which he may trust both his instrument and\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nIf the instrument is a divided one, the first thing is to learn to\r\nread the verniers. If the divisions are so fine that the coincidence is\r\nfrequently doubtful, the best plan will be for the learner to get some\r\nacquaintance who is skilled in the use of instruments, and having set\r\nthe instrument at hazard, to write down the readings of the verniers,\r\nand then request his friend to do the same; whenever there is any\r\ndifference, he should carefully examine the doubtful one, and ask his\r\nfriend to point out the minute peculiarities on which he founds his\r\ndecision. This should be repeated frequently; and after some practice,\r\nhe should note how many times in a hundred his reading differs from his\r\nfriend's, and also how many divisions they usually differ.\r\n\r\nThe next point is, to ascertain the precision with which the learner\r\ncan bisect an object with the wires of the telescope. This can be done\r\nwithout assistance. It is not necessary even to adjust the instrument,\r\nbut merely to point it to a distant object. When it bisects any\r\nremarkable point, read off the verniers, and write down the result; then\r\ndisplace the telescope a little, and adjust it again. A series of such\r\nobservations will show the confidence which is due to the observer's\r\neye in bisecting an object, and also in reading the verniers; and as the\r\nfirst direction gave him some measure of the latter, he may, in a great\r\nmeasure, appreciate his skill in the former. He should also, when he\r\nfinds a deviation in the reading, return to the telescope, and satisfy\r\nhimself if he has made the bisection as complete as he can. In general,\r\nthe student should practise each adjustment separately, and write down\r\nthe results wherever he can measure its deviations.\r\n\r\nHaving thus practised the adjustments, the next step is to make an\r\nobservation; but in order to try both himself and the instrument, let\r\nhim take the altitude of some fixed object, a terrestrial one, and\r\nhaving registered the result, let him derange the adjustment, and repeat\r\nthe process fifty or a hundred times. This will not merely afford him\r\nexcellent practice, but enable him to judge of his own skill.\r\n\r\nThe first step in the use of every instrument, is to find the limits\r\nwithin which its employer can measure the SAME OBJECT UNDER THE SAME\r\nCIRCUMSTANCES. It is only from a knowledge of this, that he can\r\nhave confidence in his measures of the SAME OBJECT UNDER DIFFERENT\r\nCIRCUMSTANCES, and after that, of DIFFERENT OBJECTS UNDER DIFFERENT\r\nCIRCUMSTANCES.\r\n\r\nThese principles are applicable to almost all instruments. If a person\r\nis desirous of ascertaining heights by a mountain barometer, let him\r\nbegin by adjusting the instrument in his own study; and having made the\r\nupper contact, let him write down the reading of the vernier, and then\r\nlet him derange the UPPER adjustment ONLY, re-adjust, and repeat the\r\nreading. When he is satisfied about the limits within which he can make\r\nthat adjustment, let him do the same repeatedly with the lower; but\r\nlet him not, until he knows his own errors in reading and adjusting,\r\npronounce upon those of the instrument. In the case of a barometer,\r\nhe must also be assured, that the temperature of the mercury does not\r\nchange during the interval.\r\n\r\nA friend once brought to me a beautifully constructed piece of\r\nmechanism, for marking minute portions of time; the three-hundredth\r\nparts of a second were indicated by it. It was a kind of watch, with\r\na pin for stopping one of the hands. I proposed that we should each\r\nendeavour to stop it twenty times in succession, at the same point. We\r\nwere both equally unpractised, and our first endeavours showed that we\r\ncould not be confident of the twentieth part of a second. In fact, both\r\nthe time occupied in causing the extremities of the fingers to obey the\r\nvolition, as well as the time employed in compressing the flesh before\r\nthe fingers acted on the stop, appeared to influence the accuracy of our\r\nobservations. From some few experiments I made, I thought I perceived\r\nthat the rapidity of the transmission of the effects of the will,\r\ndepended on the state of fatigue or health of the body. If any one were\r\nto make experiments on this subject, it might be interesting, to compare\r\nthe rapidity of the transmission of volition in different persons,\r\nwith the time occupied in obliterating an impression made on one of the\r\nsenses of the same persons. For example, by having a mechanism to make\r\na piece of ignited charcoal revolve with different degrees of velocity,\r\nsome persons will perceive a continuous circle of light before others,\r\nwhose retina does not retain so long impressions that are made upon it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION 3. ON THE FRAUDS OF OBSERVERS.\r\n\r\nScientific inquiries are more exposed than most others to the inroads of\r\npretenders; and I feel that I shall deserve the thanks of all who really\r\nvalue truth, by stating some of the methods of deceiving practised by\r\nunworthy claimants for its honours, whilst the mere circumstance of\r\ntheir arts being known may deter future offenders.\r\n\r\nThere are several species of impositions that have been practised in\r\nscience, which are but little known, except to the initiated, and which\r\nit may perhaps be possible to render quite intelligible to ordinary\r\nunderstandings. These may be classed under the heads of hoaxing,\r\nforging, trimming, and cooking.\r\n\r\nOF HOAXING. This, perhaps, will be better explained by an example. In\r\nthe year 1788, M. Gioeni, a knight of Malta, published at Naples an\r\naccount of a new family of Testacea, of which he described, with great\r\nminuteness, one species, the specific name of which has been taken from\r\nits habitat, and the generic he took from his own family, calling it\r\nGioenia Sicula. It consisted of two rounded triangular valves, united by\r\nthe body of the animal to a smaller valve in front. He gave figures\r\nof the animal, and of its parts; described its structure, its mode of\r\nadvancing along the sand, the figure of the tract it left, and estimated\r\nthe velocity of its course at about two-thirds of an inch per minute. He\r\nthen described the structure of the shell, which he treated with nitric\r\nacid, and found it approach nearer to the nature of bone than any other\r\nshell.\r\n\r\nThe editors of the ENCYCLOPEDIE METHODIQUE, have copied this\r\ndescription, and have given figures of the Gioenia Sicula. The fact,\r\nhowever, is, that no such animal exists, but that the knight of Malta,\r\nfinding on the Sicilian shores the three internal bones of one of the\r\nspecies of Bulla, of which some are found on the south-western coast\r\nof England, [Bulla lignaria] described and figured these bones most\r\naccurately, and drew the whole of the rest of the description from the\r\nstores of his own imagination.\r\n\r\nSuch frauds are far from justifiable; the only excuse which has been\r\nmade for them is, when they have been practised on scientific academies\r\nwhich had reached the period of dotage. It should however be remembered,\r\nthat the productions of nature are so various, that mere strangeness\r\nis very far from sufficient to render doubtful the existence of any\r\ncreature for which there is evidence; [The number of vertebrae in the\r\nneck of the plesiosaurus is a strange but ascertained fact] and that,\r\nunless the memoir itself involves principles so contradictory, as to\r\noutweigh the evidence of a single witness, [The kind of contradiction\r\nwhich is here alluded to, is that which arises from well ascertained\r\nfinal causes; for instance, the ruminating stomach of the hoofed\r\nanimals, is in no case combined with the claw-shaped form of the\r\nextremities, frequent in many of the carniverous animals, and necessary\r\nto some of them for the purpose of seizing their prey] it can only be\r\nregarded as a deception, without the accompaniment of wit.\r\n\r\nFORGING differs from hoaxing, inasmuch as in the latter the deceit is\r\nintended to last for a time, and then be discovered, to the ridicule of\r\nthose who have credited it; whereas the forger is one who, wishing to\r\nacquire a reputation for science, records observations which he has\r\nnever made. This is sometimes accomplished in astronomical observations\r\nby calculating the time and circumstances of the phenomenon from tables.\r\nThe observations of the second comet of 1784, which was only seen by\r\nthe Chevalier D'Angos, were long suspected to be a forgery, and were at\r\nlength proved to be so by the calculations and reasonings of Encke. The\r\npretended observations did not accord amongst each other in giving any\r\npossible orbit. But M. Encke detected an orbit, belonging to some of\r\nthe observations, from which he found that all the rest might be almost\r\nprecisely deduced, provided a mistake of a unity in the index of the\r\nlogarithm of the radius vector were supposed to have been made in all\r\nthe rest of the calculations. ZACH. CORR. ASTRON. Tom. IV. p. 456.\r\n\r\nFortunately instances of the occurrence of forging are rare.\r\n\r\nTRIMMING consists in clipping off little bits here and there from those\r\nobservations which differ most in excess from the mean, and in\r\nsticking them on to those which are too small; a species of \"equitable\r\nadjustment,\" as a radical would term it, which cannot be admitted in\r\nscience.\r\n\r\nThis fraud is not perhaps so injurious (except to the character of the\r\ntrimmer) as cooking, which the next paragraph will teach, The reason of\r\nthis is, that the AVERAGE given by the observations of the trimmer is\r\nthe same, whether they are trimmed or untrimmed. His object is to gain a\r\nreputation for extreme accuracy in making observations; but from respect\r\nfor truth, or from a prudent foresight, he does not distort the position\r\nof the fact he gets from nature, and it is usually difficult to detect\r\nhim. He has more sense or less adventure than the Cook.\r\n\r\nOF COOKING. This is an art of various forms, the object of which is to\r\ngive to ordinary observations the appearance and character of those of\r\nthe highest degree of accuracy.\r\n\r\nOne of its numerous processes is to make multitudes of observations, and\r\nout of these to select those only which agree, or very nearly agree.\r\nIf a hundred observations are made, the cook must be very unlucky if he\r\ncannot pick out fifteen or twenty which will do for serving up.\r\n\r\nAnother approved receipt, when the observations to be used will not\r\ncome within the limit of accuracy, which it has been resolved they shall\r\npossess, is to calculate them by two different formulae. The difference\r\nin the constants employed in those formulae has sometimes a most happy\r\neffect in promoting unanimity amongst discordant measures. If still\r\ngreater accuracy is required, three or more formulae can be used.\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted that this receipt is in some instances rather\r\nhazardous: but in cases where the positions of stars, as given in\r\ndifferent catalogues, occur, or different tables of specific gravities,\r\nspecific heats, &c. &c., it may safely be employed. As no catalogue\r\ncontains all stars, the computer must have recourse to several; and if\r\nhe is obliged to use his judgment in the selection, it would be cruel\r\nto deny him any little advantage which might result from it. It may,\r\nhowever, be necessary to guard against one mistake into which persons\r\nmight fall.\r\n\r\nIf an observer calculate particular stars from a catalogue which makes\r\nthem accord precisely with the rest of his results, whereas, had they\r\nbeen computed from other catalogues the difference would have been\r\nconsiderable, it is very unfair to accuse him of COOKING; for--those\r\ncatalogues may have been notoriously inaccurate; or--they may have\r\nbeen superseded by others more recent, or made with better instruments;\r\nor--the observer may have been totally ignorant of their existence.\r\n\r\nIt sometimes happens that the constant quantities in formulae given by\r\nthe highest authorities, although they differ amongst themselves, yet\r\nthey will not suit the materials. This is precisely the point in which\r\nthe skill of the artist is shown; and an accomplished cook will carry\r\nhimself triumphantly through it, provided happily some mean value of\r\nsuch constants will fit his observations. He will discuss the relative\r\nmerits of formulae he has just knowledge enough to use; and, with\r\nadmirable candour assigning their proper share of applause to Bessel, to\r\nGauss, and to Laplace, he will take THAT mean value of the constant used\r\nby three such philosophers, which will make his own observations accord\r\nto a miracle.\r\n\r\nThere are some few reflections which I would venture to suggest to those\r\nwho cook, although they may perhaps not receive the attention which, in\r\nmy opinion, they deserve, from not coming from the pen of an adept.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it must require much time to try different\r\nformulae. In the next place it may happen that, in the progress of human\r\nknowledge, more correct formula: may be discovered, and constants may\r\nbe determined with far greater precision. Or it may be found that some\r\nphysical circumstance influences the results, (although unsuspected at\r\nthe time) the measure of which circumstance may perhaps be recovered\r\nfrom other contemporary registers of facts. [Imagine, by way of example,\r\nthe state of the barometer or thermometer.] Or if the selection of\r\nobservations has been made with the view of its agreeing precisely with\r\nthe latest determination, there is some little danger that the average\r\nof the whole may differ from that of the chosen ones, owing to some law\r\nof nature, dependent on the interval between the two sets, which\r\nlaw some future philosopher may discover, and thus the very best\r\nobservations may have been thrown aside.\r\n\r\nIn all these, and in numerous other cases, it would most probably\r\nhappen that the cook would procure a temporary reputation for unrivalled\r\naccuracy at the expense of his permanent fame. It might also have the\r\neffect of rendering even all his crude observations of no value; for\r\nthat part of the scientific world whose opinion is of most weight, is\r\ngenerally so unreasonable, as to neglect altogether the observations\r\nof those in whom they have, on any occasion, discovered traces of the\r\nartist. In fact, the character of an observer, as of a woman, if doubted\r\nis destroyed.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which facts apparently lost are restored to light, even\r\nafter considerable intervals of time, is sometimes very unexpected, and\r\na few examples may not be without their use. The thermometers employed\r\nby the philosophers who composed the Academia Del Cimento, have been\r\nlost; and as they did not use the two fixed points of freezing and\r\nboiling water, the results of a great mass of observations have remained\r\nuseless from our ignorance of the value of a degree on their instrument.\r\nM. Libri, of Florence, proposed to regain this knowledge by comparing\r\ntheir registers of the temperature of the human body and of that of some\r\nwarm springs in Tuscany, which have preserved their heat uniform during\r\na century, as well as of other things similarly circumstanced.\r\n\r\nAnother illustration was pointed out to me by M. Gazzeri, the Professor\r\nof Chemistry at Florence. A few years ago an important suit in one of\r\nthe legal courts of Tuscany depended on ascertaining whether a certain\r\nword had been erased by some chemical process from a deed then before\r\nthe court. The party who insisted that an erasure had been made, availed\r\nthemselves of the knowledge of M. Gazzeri, who, concluding that those\r\nwho committed the fraud would be satisfied by the disappearance of the\r\ncolouring matter of the ink, suspected (either from some colourless\r\nmatter remaining in the letters, or perhaps from the agency of the\r\nsolvent having weakened the fabric of the paper itself beneath the\r\nsupposed letters) that the effect of the slow application of heat would\r\nbe to render some difference of texture or of applied substance evident,\r\nby some variety in the shade of colour which heat in such circumstances\r\nmight be expected to produce. Permission having been given to try the\r\nexperiment, on the application of heat the important word reappeared, to\r\nthe great satisfaction of the court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI. SUGGESTIONS FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF SCIENCE IN ENGLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION 1. OF THE NECESSITY THAT MEMBERS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY SHOULD\r\nEXPRESS THEIR OPINIONS.\r\n\r\nOne of the causes which has contributed to the success of the PARTY, is\r\nto be found in the great reluctance with which many of those whose names\r\nadded lustre to the Society expressed their opinions, and the little\r\nfirmness with which they maintained their objections. How many times\r\nhave those whose activity was additionally stimulated by their interest,\r\nproposed measures which a few words might have checked; whilst the\r\nnames of those whose culpable silence thus permitted the project to be\r\nmatured, were immediately afterwards cited by their grateful coadjutors,\r\nas having sanctioned that which in their hearts they knew to be a job.\r\n\r\nEven in the few cases which have passed the limits of such forbearance,\r\nwhen the subject has been debated in the Council, more than one, more\r\nthan two instances are known, where subsequent circumstances have\r\noccurred, which proved, with the most irresistible moral evidence, that\r\nmembers have spoken on one side of the question, and have voted on the\r\ncontrary.\r\n\r\nThis reluctance to oppose that which is disapproved, has been too\r\nextensively and too fatally prevalent for the interests of the Royal\r\nSociety. It may partly be attributed to that reserved and retiring\r\ndisposition, which frequently marks the man of real knowledge, as\r\nstrongly as an officious interference and flippant manner do the\r\ncharlatan, or the trader in science. Some portion of it is due to that\r\nimproper deference which was long paid to every dictum of the President,\r\nand much of it to that natural indisposition to take trouble on any\r\npoint in which a man's own interest is not immediately concerned. It is\r\nto be hoped, for the credit of that learned body, that no anticipation\r\nof the next feast of St. Andrew ever influenced the taciturnity of their\r\ndisposition. [It may be necessary to inform those who are not members\r\nof the Royal Society, that this is the day on which those Fellows who\r\nchoose, meet at Somerset House, to register the names of the Council and\r\nOfficers the President has been pleased to appoint for the ensuing year;\r\nand who afterwards dine together, for the purpose of praising each other\r\nover wine, which, until within these few years, was PAID for out of\r\nthe FUNDS of the Society. This abuse was attacked by an enterprising\r\nreformer, and of course defended by the coterie. It was, however,\r\ngiven up as too bad. The public may form some idea of the feeling which\r\nprevails in the Council, when they are informed that this practice was\r\ndefended by one of the officers of the Society, on the ground that,\r\nif abolished, THE ASSISTANT SECRETARY WOULD LOSE HIS PERCENTAGE ON THE\r\nTAVERN BILLS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION 2. OF BIENNIAL PRESIDENTS.\r\n\r\nThe days in which the Royal Society can have much influence in science\r\nseem long past; nor does it appear a matter of great importance who\r\nconduct its mismanaged affairs. Perpetual Presidents have been tried\r\nuntil the Society has become disgusted with dictators. If any reform\r\nshould be attempted, it might perhaps be deserving consideration whether\r\nthe practice of several of the younger institutions might not be worthy\r\nimitation, and the office of President be continued only during two\r\nsessions. There may be some inconveniences attending this arrangement;\r\nbut the advantages are conspicuous, both in the Astronomical and\r\nGeological Societies. Each President is ambitious of rendering the\r\nperiod of his reign remarkable for some improvement in the Society\r\nover which he presides; and the sacrifice of time which is made by the\r\nofficers of those Societies, would become impossible if it were required\r\nto be continued for a much longer period. Another circumstance of\r\nconsiderable importance is, that the personal character of the President\r\nis less impressed on the Society; and, supposing any injudicious\r\nalterations to be made, it is much less difficult to correct them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION 3. OF THE INFLUENCE OF THE COLLEGES OF PHYSICIANS AND SURGEONS\r\nIN THE ROYAL SOCIETY.\r\n\r\nThe honour of belonging to the Royal Society is much sought after\r\nby medical men, as contributing to the success of their professional\r\nefforts, and two consequences result from it. In the first place, the\r\npages of the Transactions of the Royal Society occasionally contain\r\nmedical papers of very moderate merit; and, in the second, the\r\npreponderance of the medical interest introduces into the Society some\r\nof the jealousies of that profession. On the other hand, medicine is\r\nintimately connected with many sciences, and its professors are usually\r\ntoo much occupied in their practice to exert themselves, except upon\r\ngreat occasions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION 4. OF THE INFLUENCE OF THE ROYAL INSTITUTION ON THE ROYAL\r\nSOCIETY.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Institution was founded for the cultivation of the more\r\npopular and elementary branches of scientific knowledge, and has risen,\r\npartly from the splendid discoveries of Davy, and partly from the\r\ndecline of the Royal Society, to a more prominent station than it would\r\notherwise have occupied in the science of England. Its general\r\neffects in diffusing knowledge among the more educated classes of the\r\nmetropolis, have been, and continue to be, valuable. Its influence,\r\nhowever, in the government of the Royal Society, is by no means attended\r\nwith similar advantages, and has justly been viewed with considerable\r\njealousy by many of the Fellows of that body. It may be stated,\r\nwithout disparagement to the Royal Institution, that the scientific\r\nqualifications necessary for its officers, however respectable, are not\r\nquite of that high order which ought to be required for those of the\r\nRoyal Society, if the latter body were in a state of vigour.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Institution interest has always been sufficient to appoint one\r\nof the Secretaries of the Royal Society; and at the present moment they\r\nhave appointed two. In a short time, unless some effectual check is put\r\nto this, we shall find them nominating the President and the rest of the\r\nofficers. It is certainly not consistent with the dignity of the Royal\r\nSociety thus to allow its offices to be given away as the rewards of\r\nservices rendered to other institutions. The only effectual way to put a\r\nstop to this increasing interest would be, to declare that no manager\r\nor officer of the Royal Institution should ever, at the same time, hold\r\noffice in the Royal Society.\r\n\r\nThe use the Members of the Royal Institution endeavour to make of their\r\npower in the Council of the Royal Society, is exemplified in the minutes\r\nof the Council of March 11, 1830, which may be consulted with advantage\r\nby those who doubt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION 5. OF THE TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY.\r\n\r\nThe Transactions of the Royal Society, unlike those of most foreign\r\nacademies, contain nothing relating to the history of the Society. The\r\nvolumes contain merely those papers communicated to the Society in\r\nthe preceding year which the Council have selected for printing, a\r\nmeteorological register, and a notice of the award of the annual medals,\r\nwithout any list of the Council and officers of the Society, by whom\r\nthat selection and that award have been made.\r\n\r\nBefore I proceed to criticise this state of things, I will mention one\r\npoint on which I am glad to be able to bestow on the Royal Society the\r\nhighest praise. I refer to the extreme regularity with which the volumes\r\nof the Transactions are published. The appearance of the half-volumes at\r\nintervals of six months, insures for any communication almost immediate\r\npublicity; whilst the shortness of the time between its reception and\r\npublication, is a guarantee to the public that the whole of the paper\r\nwas really communicated at the time it bears date. To this may also be\r\nadded, the rarity of any alterations made previously to the printing,\r\na circumstance which ought to be imitated, as well as admired, by other\r\nsocieties. There may, indeed, be some, perhaps the Geological, in which\r\nthe task is more difficult, from the nature of the subject. The sooner,\r\nhowever, all societies can reduce themselves to this rule, of rarely\r\nallowing any thing but a few verbal corrections to papers that are\r\nplaced in their hands, the better it will be for their own reputation,\r\nand for the interests of science.\r\n\r\nIt has been, and continues to be, a subject of deep regret, that the\r\nfirst scientific academy in Europe, the Institute of France, should be\r\nthus negligent in the regularity of its publications; and it is the\r\nmore to be regretted, that it should be years in arrear, from the\r\ncircumstance, that the memoirs admitted into their collection are\r\nusually of the highest merit. I know some of their most active members\r\nhave wished it were otherwise; I would urge them to put a stop to a\r\npractice, which, whilst it has no advantages to recommend it, is unjust\r\nto those who contribute, and is only calculated to produce conflicting\r\nclaims, equally injurious to science, and to the reputation of that\r\nbody, whose negligence may have given rise to them. [Mr. Herschel,\r\nspeaking of a paper of Fresnel's, observes--\"This memoir was read to\r\nthe Institute, 7th of October, 1816; a supplement was received, 19th of\r\nJanuary, 1818; M. Arago's report on it was read, 4th of June, 1821: and\r\nwhile every optical philosopher in Europe has been impatiently expecting\r\nits appearance for seven years, it lies as yet unpublished, and is only\r\nknown to us by meagre notices in a periodical journal.\" MR HERSCHEL'S\r\nTREATISE ON LIGHT, p. 533.--ENCYCLOPAEDIA METROPOLITANA.]\r\n\r\nOne of the inconveniences arising from having no historical portion in\r\nthe volumes of the Royal Society is, that not only the public, but our\r\nown members are almost entirely ignorant of all its affairs. With a\r\nmeans of giving considerable publicity (by the circulation of above 800\r\ncopies of the Transactions) to whatever we wish to have made known to\r\nour members or to the world, will it be credited, that no notice was\r\ntaken in our volume for 1826, of the foundation of two Royal medals,\r\nnor of the conditions under which they were to be distributed. [That\r\nthe Council refrained from having their first award of those medals thus\r\ncommunicated, is rather creditable to them, and proves that they had a\r\nbecoming feeling respecting their former errors.] That in 1828, when\r\na new fund, called the donation fund, was established, and through the\r\nliberality of Dr. Wollaston and Mr. Davies Gilbert, it was endowed by\r\nthem with the respective sums of 2,000L. and 1,000L. 3 per cents;\r\nno notice of such fact appears in our Transactions for 1829. Other\r\ngentlemen have contributed; and if it is desirable to possess such a\r\nfund, it is surely of importance to inform the non-attending, which is\r\nby far the largest part of the Society, that it exists; and that we are\r\ngrateful to those by whom it has been founded and augmented. Neither\r\ndid the Philosophical Transactions inform our absent members, that they\r\ncould purchase the President's Discourses at the trade-price.\r\n\r\nThe list of the Officers, Council, and Members of the Royal Society is\r\nprinted annually; yet, who ever saw it bound up with the Philosophical\r\nTransactions, to which it is intended to be attached? I never met with\r\na single copy of that work so completed, not even the one in our own\r\nlibrary. It is extremely desirable that the Society should know the\r\nnames of their Council; and whilst it would in some measure contribute\r\nto prevent the President from placing incompetent persons upon it, it\r\nwould also afford some check, although perhaps but a slight one, on\r\nthe distribution of the medals. When I have urged the expediency of the\r\npractice, I have been answered by excuses, that the list could not be\r\nmade up in time for the volume. If this is true of the first part, they\r\nmight appear with the second; and even if this were impracticable, the\r\nplan of prefixing them to the volume of the succeeding year, would\r\nbe preferable to that of omitting them altogether. The true reason,\r\nhowever, appeared at last. It was objected to the plan, that by the\r\npresent arrangement, the porter of the Royal Society took round the\r\nlist to those members resident in London, and got from some of them a\r\nremuneration, in the shape of a Christmas-box; and this would be lost,\r\nif the time of printing were changed. [During the printing of this\r\nchapter, a friend, on whom I had called, complained that the porter of\r\nthe Royal Society had demanded half-a-crown for leaving the list.] Such\r\nare the paltry interests to which those of the Royal Society are made to\r\nbow.\r\n\r\nAnother point on which information ought to be given in each volume,\r\nis the conditions on which the distribution of the Society's medals\r\nare made. It is true that these are, or ought to be, printed with\r\nthe Statutes of the Society; but that volume is only in the hands of\r\nmembers, and it is for the credit of the medals themselves, that the\r\nlaws which regulate their award should be widely known, in order that\r\npersons, not members of the Society, might enter into competition for\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nInformation relative to the admissions and deaths amongst the Society\r\nwould also be interesting; a list of the names of those whom the Society\r\nhad lost, and of those members who had been added to its ranks each\r\nyear, would find a proper place in the historical pages which ought to\r\nbe given with each volume of our Transactions.\r\n\r\nThe want of a distinction between the working members of the Society,\r\nand those who merely honour it with their patronage, renders many\r\narrangements, which would be advantageous to science, in some cases,\r\ninjudicious, and in other instances, almost impossible.\r\n\r\nCollections of Observations which are from time to time given to the\r\nSociety, may be of such a nature, that but few of the members are\r\ninterested in them. In such cases, the expense of printing above 800\r\ncopies may reasonably induce the Council to decline printing them\r\naltogether; whereas, if they had any means of discrimination for\r\ndistributing them, they might be quite willing to incur the expense\r\nof printing 250. Other cases may occur, in which great advantage\r\nwould accrue, if the principle were once admitted. Government, the\r\nUniversities, public bodies, and even individuals might, in some cases,\r\nbe disposed to present to the Royal Society a limited number of copies\r\nof their works, if they knew that they were likely to be placed in\r\nthe hands of persons who would use them. Fifty or a hundred additional\r\ncopies might, in some cases, not be objected to on the ground of\r\nexpense, when seven or eight hundred would be quite out of the question.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose twenty copies of a description of some new chemical\r\nprocess to be placed at the disposal of the Royal Society by any public\r\nbody; it will not surely be contended that they ought all to remain on\r\nthe Society's shelves. Yet, with our present rules, that would be the\r\ncase. If, however, the list of the Members of the Society were read over\r\nto the Council, and the names of those gentlemen known to be conversant\r\nwith chemical science were written down; then, if nineteen copies of\r\nthe work were given to those nineteen persons on this list, who had\r\ncontributed most to the Transactions of the Society, they would in all\r\nprobability be placed in the fittest hands.\r\n\r\nComplete sets of the Philosophical Transactions have now become\r\nextremely bulky; it might be well worth our consideration, whether the\r\nknowledge of the many valuable papers they contain would not be much\r\nspread, by publishing the abstracts of them which have been read at the\r\nordinary meetings of the Society. Perhaps two or three volumes octavo,\r\nwould contain all that has been done in this way during the last\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nAnother circumstance, which would contribute much to the order of the\r\nproceedings of the Council, would be to have a distinct list made out of\r\nall the statutes and orders of the Council relating to each particular\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nThus the President, by having at one view before him all that had ever\r\nbeen decreed on the question under consideration, would be much better\r\nable to prevent inconsistent resolutions, and to save the time of the\r\nCouncil from being wasted by unnecessary discussions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION 6. ORDER OF MERIT.\r\n\r\nAmongst the various proposals for encouraging science, the institution\r\nof an order of merit has been suggested. It is somewhat singular, that\r\nwhilst in most of the other kingdoms of Europe, such orders exist for\r\nthe purpose of rewarding, by honorary distinctions, the improvers of the\r\narts of life, or successful discoverers in science, nothing of the\r\nkind has been established in England. [At the great meeting of the\r\nphilosophers at Berlin, in 1828, of which an account is given in the\r\nAppendix; the respect in which Berzelius, Oersted, Gauss, and Humboldt\r\nwere held in their respective countries was apparent in the orders\r\nbestowed on them by the Sovereigns of Sweden, of Denmark, of Hanover,\r\nand of Prussia; and there were present many other philosophers, whose\r\ndecorations sufficiently attested the respect in which science was held\r\nin the countries from which they came.]\r\n\r\nOur orders of knighthood are favourable only to military distinction.\r\nIt has been urged, as an argument for such institutions, that they are a\r\ncheap mode of rewarding science, whilst, on the other hand, it has\r\nbeen objected, that they would diminish the value of such honorary\r\ndistinctions by making them common. The latter objection is of little\r\nweight, because the numbers who pursue science are few, and, probably,\r\nwill long continue so. It would also be easily avoided, by restricting\r\nthe number of the order or of the class, if it were to form a peculiar\r\nclass of another order. Another objection, however, appears to me to\r\npossess far greater weight; and, however strong the disposition of the\r\nGovernment might be (if such an order existed) to fill it properly, I\r\ndo not believe that, in the present state of public opinion respecting\r\nscience, it could be done, and, in all probability, it would be filled\r\nup through the channels of patronage, and by mere jobbers in science.\r\n\r\nAnother proposal, of a similar kind, has also been talked of, one which\r\nit may appear almost ridiculous to suggest in England, but which would\r\nbe considered so in no other country. It is, to ennoble some of the\r\ngreatest scientific benefactors of their country. Not to mention\r\npolitical causes, the ranks of the nobility are constantly recruited\r\nfrom the army, the navy, and the bar; why should not the family of that\r\nman, whose name is imperishably connected with the steam-engine, be\r\nenrolled amongst the nobility of his country? In utility and profit,\r\nnot merely to that country, but to the human race, his deeds may proudly\r\nclaim comparison even with the most splendid of those achieved by\r\nclasses so rich in glorious recollections. An objection, in most cases\r\nfatal to such a course, arises from the impolicy of conferring a title,\r\nunless a considerable fortune exists to support it; a circumstance\r\nvery rarely occurring to the philosopher. It might in some measure be\r\nremoved, by creating such titles only for life. But here, again, until\r\nthere existed some knowledge of science amongst the higher classes, and\r\na sound state of public opinion relative to science, the execution of\r\nthe plan could only be injurious.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION 7. OF THE UNION OF SCIENTIFIC SOCIETIES.\r\n\r\nThis idea has occurred to several persons, as likely to lead to\r\nconsiderable advantages to science. If the various scientific societies\r\ncould unite in the occupation of one large building, considerable\r\neconomy would result from the union. By properly arranging their\r\nevenings of meeting, one meeting-room only need be required. The\r\nlibraries might either be united, or arranged in adjoining rooms; and\r\nsuch a system would greatly facilitate the inquiries of scientific\r\npersons.\r\n\r\nWhether it would be possible to reunite in any way the different\r\nsocieties to the Royal Society, might be a delicate question; but\r\nalthough, on some accounts, desirable, that event is not necessary for\r\nthe purpose of their having a common residence.\r\n\r\nThe Medico-Botanical Society might, perhaps, from sympathy, be the first\r\nto which the Royal Society would apply; and by a proper interchange of\r\ndiplomas, [A thing well understood by the INITIATED, both at HOME and\r\nABROAD.] the two societies might be inoculated with each other. But\r\neven here some tact would be required; the Medico-Botanical is a\r\nlittle particular about the purity of its written documents, and lately\r\nattributed blame to one of its officers for some slight tampering with\r\nthem, a degree of illiberality which the Council of the Royal Society\r\nare far from imitating.\r\n\r\nThe Geological and the Astronomical Societies nourish no feelings of\r\nresentment to the parent institution for their early persecution; and\r\nthough they have no inducement to seek, would scarcely refuse any union\r\nwhich might be generally advantageous to science.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION.\r\n\r\nIn a work on the Decline of Science, at a period when England has so\r\nrecently lost two of its brightest ornaments, I should hardly be excused\r\nif I omitted to devote a few words to the names of Wollaston and of\r\nDavy. Until the warm feelings of surviving kindred and admiring friends\r\nshall be cold as the grave from which remembrance vainly recalls\r\ntheir cherished forms, invested with all the life and energy of\r\nrecent existence, the volumes of their biography must be sealed. Their\r\ncontemporaries can expect only to read their eloge.\r\n\r\nIn habits of intercourse with both those distinguished individuals,\r\nsufficiently frequent to mark the curiously different structure of their\r\nminds, I was yet not on such terms even with him I most esteemed, as to\r\nview his great qualities through that medium which is rarely penetrated\r\nby the eyes of long and very intimate friendship.\r\n\r\nCaution and precision were the predominant features of the character\r\nof Wollaston, and those who are disposed to reduce the number of\r\nprinciples, would perhaps justly trace the precision which adorned\r\nhis philosophical, to the extreme caution which pervaded his moral\r\ncharacter. It may indeed be questioned whether the latter quality will\r\nnot in all persons of great abilities produce the former.\r\n\r\nAmbition constituted a far larger ingredient in the character of\r\nDavy, and with the daring hand of genius he grasped even the remotest\r\nconclusions to which a theory led him. He seemed to think invention a\r\nmore common attribute than it really is, and hastened, as soon as he was\r\nin possession of a new fact or a new principle, to communicate it to the\r\nworld, doubtful perhaps lest he might not be anticipated; but, confident\r\nin his own powers, he was content to give to others a chance of reaping\r\nsome part of that harvest, the largest portion of which he knew must\r\nstill fall to his own share.\r\n\r\nDr. Wollaston, on the other hand, appreciated more truly the rarity of\r\nthe inventive faculty; and, undeterred by the fear of being anticipated,\r\nwhen he had contrived a new instrument, or detected a new principle, he\r\nbrought all the information that he could collect from others, or which\r\narose from his own reflection, to bear upon it for years, before he\r\ndelivered it to the world.\r\n\r\nThe most singular characteristic of Wollaston's mind was the plain and\r\ndistinct line which separated what he knew from what he did not know;\r\nand this again, arising from his precision, might be traced to caution.\r\n\r\nIt would, however, have been visible to such an extent in few except\r\nhimself, for there were very few so perfectly free from vanity and\r\naffectation. To this circumstance may be attributed a peculiarity of\r\nmanner in the mode in which he communicated information to those\r\nwho sought it from him, which was to many extremely disagreeable. He\r\nusually, by a few questions, ascertained precisely how much the inquirer\r\nknew upon the subject, or the exact point at which his ignorance\r\ncommenced, a process not very agreeable to the vanity of mankind; taking\r\nup the subject at this point, he would then very clearly and shortly\r\nexplain it.\r\n\r\nHis acquaintance with mathematics was very limited. Many years since,\r\nwhen I was an unsuccessful candidate for a professorship of mathematics,\r\nI applied to Dr. W. for a recommendation; he declined it, on the ground\r\nof its not being his pursuit. I told him I asked it, because I thought\r\nit would have weight, to which he replied, that it ought to have none\r\nwhatever. There is no doubt his view was the just one. Yet such is the\r\nstate of ignorance which exists on these subjects, that I have several\r\ntimes heard him mentioned as one of the greatest mathematicians of the\r\nage. [This of course could only have happened in England.] But in this\r\nas in all other points, the precision with which he comprehended\r\nand retained all he had ever learned, especially of the elementary\r\napplications of mathematics to physics, was such, that he possessed\r\ngreater command over those subjects than many of far more extensive\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\nIn associating with Wollaston, you perceived that the predominant\r\nprinciple was to avoid error; in the society of Davy, you saw that it\r\nwas the desire to see and make known truth. Wollaston never could have\r\nbeen a poet; Davy might have been a great one.\r\n\r\nA question which I put, successively, to each of these distinguished\r\nphilosophers, will show how very differently a subject may be viewed by\r\nminds even of the highest order.\r\n\r\nAbout the time Mr. Perkins was making his experiments on the compression\r\nof water, I was much struck with the mechanical means he had brought to\r\nbear on the subject, and was speculating on other applications of it,\r\nwhich I will presently mention.\r\n\r\nMeeting Dr. Wollaston one morning in the shop of a bookseller, I\r\nproposed this question: If two volumes of hydrogen and one of oxygen are\r\nmixed together in a vessel, and if by mechanical pressure they can be so\r\ncondensed as to become of the same specific gravity as water, will the\r\ngases under these circumstances unite and form water? \"What do you think\r\nthey will do?\" said Dr. W. I replied, that I should rather expect they\r\nwould unite. \"I see no reason to suppose it,\" said he. I then inquired\r\nwhether he thought the experiment worth making. He answered, that he did\r\nnot, for that he should think it would certainly not succeed.\r\n\r\nA few days after, I proposed the same question to Sir Humphry Davy. He\r\nat once said, \"they will become water, of course;\" and on my inquiring\r\nwhether he thought the experiment worth making, he observed that it was\r\na good experiment, but one which it was hardly necessary to make, as it\r\nmust succeed.\r\n\r\nThese were off-hand answers, which it might perhaps be hardly fair to\r\nhave recorded, had they been of persons of less eminent talent: and it\r\nadds to the curiosity of the circumstance to mention, that I believe Dr.\r\nWollaston's reason for supposing no union would take place, arose\r\nfrom the nature of the electrical relations of the two gases remaining\r\nunchanged, an objection which did not weigh with the philosopher whose\r\ndiscoveries had given birth to it.\r\n\r\n[The result of the experiment appeared, and still appears to me, to be\r\nof the highest importance; and I will shortly state the views with which\r\nit was connected. The next great discovery in chemistry to definite\r\nproportions, will be to find means of forming all the simple unions of\r\none atom with one, with two, or with more of say other substance: and it\r\noccurred to me that the gaseous bodies presented the fairest chance of\r\nsuccess; and that if wishing, for instance, to unite four atoms of one\r\nsubstance with one of another, we could, by mechanical means, reduce the\r\nmixed gases to the same specific gravity as the substance would possess\r\nwhich resulted from their union, then either that such union would\r\nactually take place, or the particles of the two substances would be\r\nmost favourably situated for the action of caloric, electricity, or\r\nother causes, to produce the combination. It would indeed seem to\r\nfollow, that if combination should take place under such circumstances,\r\nthen the most probable proportion in which the atoms would unite, should\r\nbe that which furnished a fluid of the least specific gravity: but\r\nuntil the experiments are made, it is by no means certain that other\r\ncombinations might not be produced.]\r\n\r\nThe singular minuteness of the particles of bodies submitted by Dr.\r\nWollaston to chemical analysis, has excited the admiration of all\r\nthose who have had the good fortune to witness his experiments; and the\r\nmethods he employed deserve to be much more widely known.\r\n\r\nIt appears to me that a great mistake exists on the subject. It has been\r\nadduced as one of those facts which prove the extraordinary acuteness of\r\nthe bodily senses of the individual,--a circumstance which, if it\r\nwere true, would add but little to his philosophical character; I am,\r\nhowever, inclined to view it in a far different light, and to see in it\r\none of the natural results of the admirable precision of his knowledge.\r\n\r\nDuring the many opportunities I have enjoyed of seeing his minute\r\nexperiments, I remember but one instance in which I noticed any\r\nremarkable difference in the acuteness of his bodily faculties, either\r\nof his hearing, his sight, or of his sense of smell, from those of other\r\npersons who possessed them in a good degree. [This was at Mr. South's\r\nobservatory, and the object was, the dots on the declination circle of\r\nhis equatorial; but, in this instance, Dr. Wollaston did not attempt to\r\nTEACH ME HOW TO SEE THEM.]\r\n\r\nHe never showed me an almost microscopic wire, which was visible to his,\r\nand invisible to my own eye: even in the beautiful experiments he made\r\nrelative to sounds inaudible to certain ears, he never produced a tone\r\nwhich was unheard by mine, although sensible to his ear; and I believe\r\nthis will be found to have been the case by most of those whose minds\r\nhad been much accustomed to experimental inquiries, and who possessed\r\ntheir faculties unimpaired by illness or by age.\r\n\r\nIt was a much more valuable property on which the success of such\r\ninquiries depended. It arose from the perfect attention which he could\r\ncommand, and the minute precision with which he examined every object. A\r\nstriking illustration of the fact that an object is frequently not seen,\r\nFROM NOT KNOWING HOW TO SEE IT, rather than from any defect in the organ\r\nof vision, occurred to me some years since, when on a visit at Slough.\r\nConversing with Mr. Herschel on the dark lines seen in the solar\r\nspectrum by Fraunhofer, he inquired whether I had seen them; and on my\r\nreplying in the negative, and expressing a great desire to see them,\r\nhe mentioned the extreme difficulty he had had, even with Fraunhofer's\r\ndescription in his hand and the long time which it had cost him in\r\ndetecting them. My friend then added, \"I will prepare the apparatus, and\r\nput you in such a position that they shall be visible, and yet you shall\r\nlook for them and not find them: after which, while you remain in the\r\nsame position, I will instruct you how to see them, and you shall see\r\nthem, and not merely wonder you did not see them before, but you shall\r\nfind it impossible to look at the spectrum without seeing them.\"\r\n\r\nOn looking as I was directed, notwithstanding the previous warning, I\r\ndid not see them; and after some time I inquired how they might be seen,\r\nwhen the prediction of Mr. Herschel was completely fulfilled.\r\n\r\nIt was this attention to minute phenomena which Dr. Wollaston applied\r\nwith such powerful effect to chemistry. In the ordinary cases of\r\nprecipitation the cloudiness is visible in a single drop as well as in\r\na gallon of a solution; and in those cases where the cloudiness is so\r\nslight, as to require a mass of fluid to render it visible, previous\r\nevaporation, quickly performed on slips of window glass, rendered the\r\nsolution more concentrated.\r\n\r\nThe true value of this minute chemistry arises from its cheapness and\r\nthe extreme rapidity with which it can be accomplished: it may, in hands\r\nlike those of Wollaston, be used for discovery, but not for measure. I\r\nhave thought it more necessary to place this subject on what I consider\r\nits true grounds, for two reasons. In the first place, I feel that\r\ninjustice has been done to a distinguished philosopher in attributing\r\nto some of his bodily senses that excellence which I think is proved to\r\nhave depended on the admirable training of his intellectual faculties.\r\nAnd, in the next place, if I have established the fact, whilst it\r\naffords us better means of judging of such observations as lay claim to\r\nan accuracy \"MORE THAN HUMAN,\" it also opens, to the patient inquirer\r\ninto truth, a path by which he may acquire powers that he would\r\notherwise have thought were only the gift of nature to a favoured few.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX, No. 1.\r\n\r\nIn presenting to my readers the account of the meeting of men of science\r\nat Berlin, in the autumn of 1828, I am happy to be able to state, that\r\nits influence has been most beneficial, and that the annual meeting\r\nto be held in 1831, will take place at Vienna, the Emperor of Austria\r\nhaving expressed a wish that every facility which his capital affords\r\nshould be given to promote its objects.\r\n\r\nIt is gratifying to find that a country, which has hitherto been\r\nconsidered adverse to the progress of knowledge, should become convinced\r\nof its value; and it is sincerely to be hoped, that every one of the\r\nnumerous members of the Society will show, by his conduct, that the\r\npaths of science are less likely than any others to interfere with those\r\nof politics.\r\n\r\n\r\nACCOUNT OF THE GREAT CONGRESS OF PHILOSOPHERS AT BERLIN, ON THE 18TH OF\r\nSEPTEMBER 1828. FROM THE EDINBURGH JOURNAL OF SCIENCE, APRIL, 1829.\r\n\r\nThe existence of a large society of cultivators of the natural sciences\r\nmeeting annually at some great capital, or some central town of Europe,\r\nis a circumstance almost unknown to us, and deserving of our attention,\r\nfrom the important advantages which may arise from it.\r\n\r\nAbout eight years ago, Dr. Okens, of Munich, suggested a plan for an\r\nannual meeting of all Germans who cultivated the sciences of medicine\r\nand botany. The first meeting, of about forty members, took place at\r\nLeipsic, in 1822, and it was successively held at Halle, Wurtzburg,\r\nFrankfort on the Maine, Dresden, Munich, and Berlin. All those who had\r\nprinted a certain number of sheets of their inquiries on these subjects\r\nwere considered members of this academy.\r\n\r\nThe great advantages which resulted to these sciences from the\r\ncommunication of observations from all quarters of Germany, soon induced\r\nan extension of the plan, and other departments of natural knowledge\r\nwere admitted, until, at the last meeting, the cultivators even of pure\r\nmathematics were found amongst the ranks of this academy.\r\n\r\nSeveral circumstances, independent of the form and constitution of the\r\nacademy, contributed to give unwonted splendour to the last meeting,\r\nwhich took place at Berlin in the middle of September of the last year.\r\n\r\nThe capital selected for its temporary residence is scarcely surpassed\r\nby any in Europe in the number and celebrity of its savans.\r\n\r\nThe taste for knowledge possessed by the reigning family, has made\r\nknowledge itself fashionable; and the severe sufferings of the Prussians\r\nprevious to the war, by which themselves and Europe were freed, have\r\nimpressed on them so strongly the lesson that \"knowledge is power,\" that\r\nits effects are visible in every department of the government; and there\r\nis no country in Europe in which talents and genius so surely open for\r\ntheir possessors the road to wealth and distinction.\r\n\r\nAnother circumstance also contributed its portion to increase the\r\nnumbers of the meeting of the past year. The office of president, which\r\nis annually changed, was assigned to M. Alexander de Humboldt. The\r\nuniversality of his acquirements, which have left no branch within the\r\nwide range of science indifferent or unexplored, has connected him by\r\nfriendship with almost all the most celebrated philosophers of the age;\r\nwhilst the polished amenity of his manners, and that intense desire of\r\nacquiring and of spreading knowledge, which so peculiarly characterizes\r\nhis mind, renders him accessible to all strangers, and insures for them\r\nthe assistance of his counsel in their scientific pursuits, and the\r\nadvantage of being made known to all those who are interested or\r\noccupied in similar inquiries.\r\n\r\nProfessor Lichtenstein, (Director of the Museum of Zoology,) as\r\nsecretary of the academy, was indefatigable in his attentions, and most\r\nably seconded the wishes of its distinguished president.\r\n\r\nThese two gentlemen, assisted by several of the residents at Berlin,\r\nundertook the numerous preliminary arrangements necessary for the\r\naccommodation of the meeting.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of September, 1828, there were assembled at Berlin 377\r\nmembers of the academy, whose names and residences (in Berlin) were\r\nprinted in a small pamphlet, and to each name was attached a number,\r\nto indicate his seat in the great concert room, in which the morning\r\nmeetings took place. Each member was also provided with an engraved card\r\nof the hall of meeting, on which the numbers of the seats were printed\r\nin black ink, and his own peculiar seat marked in red ink, so that every\r\nperson immediately found his own place, and knew where to look for any\r\nfriend whom he might wish to find.\r\n\r\nAt the hour appointed for the opening of the meeting, the members being\r\nassembled, and the galleries and orchestra being filled by an assemblage\r\nof a large part of the rank and beauty of the capital, and the\r\nside-boxes being occupied by several branches of the royal family, and\r\nby the foreign ambassadors, the session of the academy was opened by the\r\neloquent address of the president.\r\n\r\nSPEECH made at the Opening of the Society of German Naturalists and\r\nNatural Philosophers at Berlin, the 18th of September, 1828.--By\r\nALEXANDER VON HUMBOLDT.\r\n\r\nSince through your choice, which does me so much honour, I am permitted\r\nto open this meeting, the first duty which I have to discharge is one of\r\ngratitude. The distinction which has been conferred on him who has never\r\nyet been able to attend your excellent society, is not the reward of\r\nscientific efforts, or of feeble and persevering attempts to discover\r\nnew phenomena, or to draw the light of knowledge from the unexplored\r\ndepths of nature. A finer feeling, however, directed your attention to\r\nme. You have assured me, that while, during an absence of many years,\r\nand in a distant quarter of the globe, I was labouring in the same\r\ncause with yourselves, I was not a stranger in your thoughts. You have\r\nlikewise greeted my return home, that, by the sacred tie of gratitude,\r\nyou might bind me still longer and closer to our common country.\r\n\r\nWhat, however, can the picture of this, our native land, present more\r\nagreeable to the mind, than the assembly which we receive to-day for\r\nthe first time within our walls; from the banks of the Neckar, the\r\nbirth-place of Kepler and of Schiller, to the remotest border of the\r\nBaltic plains; from hence to the mouths of the Rhine, where, under the\r\nbeneficent influence of commerce, the treasuries of exotic nature have\r\nfor centuries been collected and investigated, the friends of nature,\r\ninspired with the same zeal, and, urged by the same passion, flock\r\ntogether to this assembly. Everywhere, where the German language is\r\nused, and its peculiar structure affects the spirit and disposition\r\nof the people. From the Great European Alps, to the other side of the\r\nWeichsel, where, in the country of Copernicus, astronomy rose to renewed\r\nsplendour; everywhere in the extensive dominions of the German nation\r\nwe attempt to discover the secret operations of nature, whether in the\r\nheavens, or in the deepest problems of mechanics, or in the interior of\r\nthe earth, or in the finely woven tissues of organic structure.\r\n\r\nProtected by noble princes, this assembly has annually increased in\r\ninterest and extent. Every distinction which difference of religion\r\nor form of government can occasion is here annulled. Germany manifests\r\nitself as it were in its intellectual unity; and since knowledge of\r\ntruth and performance of duty are the highest object of morality,\r\nthat feeling of unity weakens none of the bonds which the religion,\r\nconstitution, and laws of our country, have rendered dear to each of\r\nus. Even this emulation in mental struggles has called forth (as the\r\nglorious history of our country tells us,) the fairest blossoms of\r\nhumanity, science, and art.\r\n\r\nThe assembly of German naturalists and natural philosophers since its\r\nlast meeting, when it was so hospitably received at Munich, has, through\r\nthe flattering interest of neighbouring states and academies, shone\r\nwith peculiar lustre. Allied nations have renewed the ancient alliance\r\nbetween Germany and the ancient Scandinavian North.\r\n\r\nSuch an interest deserves acknowledgment the more, because it\r\nunexpectedly increases the mass of facts and opinions which are\r\nhere brought into one common and useful union. It also recalls lofty\r\nrecollections into the mind of the naturalist. Scarcely half a century\r\nhas elapsed since Linne appears, in the boldness of the undertakings\r\nwhich he has attempted and accomplished, as one of the greatest men of\r\nthe last century. His glory, however bright, has not rendered Europe\r\nblind to the merits of Scheele and Bergman. The catalogue of these great\r\nnames is not completed; but lest I shall offend noble modesty, I dare\r\nnot speak of the light which is still flowing in richest profusion\r\nfrom the North, nor mention the discoveries in the chemical nature of\r\nsubstances, in the numerical relation of their elements, or the eddying\r\nstreams of electro-magnetic powers. [The philosophers here referred to\r\nare Berzelius and Oersted.] May those excellent persons, who, deterred\r\nneither by perils of sea or land, have hastened to our meeting from\r\nSweden, Norway, Denmark, Holland, England, and Poland, point our the way\r\nto other strangers in succeeding years, so that by turns every part\r\nof Germany may enjoy the effects of scientific communication with the\r\ndifferent nations of Europe.\r\n\r\nBut although I must restrain the expression of my personal feelings\r\nin presence of this assembly, I must be permitted at least to name the\r\npatriarchs of our national glory, who are detained from us by a regard\r\nfor those lives so dear to their country;--Goethe, whom the great\r\ncreations of poetical fancy have not prevented from penetrating the\r\nARCANA of nature, and who now in rural solitude mourns for his princely\r\nfriend, as Germany for one of her greatest ornaments;--Olbers, who has\r\ndiscovered two bodies where he had already predicted they were to be\r\nfound;--the greatest anatomists of our age--Soemmering, who, with equal\r\nzeal, has investigated the wonders of organic structure, and the spots\r\nand FACULAE of the sun, (condensations and openings of the photosphere;)\r\nBlumenbach, whose pupil I have the honour to be, who, by his works and\r\nhis immortal eloquence, has inspired everywhere a love of comparative\r\nanatomy, physiology, and the general history of nature, and who\r\nhas laboured diligently for half a century. How could I resist the\r\ntemptation to adorn my discourse with names which posterity will repeat,\r\nas we are not favoured with their presence?\r\n\r\nThese observations on the literary wealth of our native country, and the\r\nprogressive developement of our institution, lead us naturally to\r\nthe obstructions which will arise from the increasing number of our\r\nfellow-labourers, The chief object of this assembly does not consist,\r\nas in other societies whose sphere is more limited, in the mutual\r\ninterchange of treatises, or in innumerable memoirs, destined to be\r\nprinted in some general collection. The principal object of this Society\r\nis, to bring those personally together who are engaged in the same field\r\nof science. It is the immediate, and therefore more obvious interchange\r\nof ideas, whether they present themselves as facts, opinions, or\r\ndoubts. It is the foundation of friendly connexion which throws light\r\non science, adds cheerfulness to life, and gives patience and amenity to\r\nthe manners.\r\n\r\nIn the most flourishing period of ancient Greece, the distinction\r\nbetween words and writing first manifested itself most strongly amongst\r\na race, which had raised itself to the most splendid intellectual\r\nsuperiority, and to whose latest descendants, as preserved from the\r\nshipwreck of nations, we still consecrate our most anxious wishes. It\r\nwas not the difficulty of interchange of ideas alone, nor the want of\r\nGerman science, which has spread thought as on wings through the world,\r\nand insured it a long continuance, that then induced the friends of\r\nphilosophy and natural history in Magna Graecia and Asia Minor to wander\r\non long journeys. That ancient race knew the inspiring influence of\r\nconversation as it extemporaneously, freely, and prudently penetrates\r\nthe tissue of scientific opinions and doubts. The discovery of the truth\r\nwithout difference of opinion is unattainable, because the truth, in its\r\ngreatest extent, can never be recognized by all, and at the same time.\r\nEach step, which seems to bring the explorer of nature nearer to his\r\nobject, only carries him to the threshold of new labyrinths. The mass of\r\ndoubt does not diminish, but spreads like a moving cloud over other and\r\nnew fields; and whoever has called that a golden period, when difference\r\nof opinions, or, as some are accustomed to express it, the disputes\r\nof the learned, will be finished, has as imperfect a conception of the\r\nwants of science, and of its continued advancement, as a person who\r\nexpects that the same opinions in geognosy, chemistry, or physiology,\r\nwill be maintained for several centuries.\r\n\r\nThe founders of this society, with a deep sense of the unity of nature,\r\nhave combined in the completest manner, all the branches of physical\r\nknowledge, and the historical, geometrical, and experimental philosophy.\r\nThe names of natural historian and natural philosopher are here,\r\ntherefore, nearly synonymous, chained by a terrestrial link to the type\r\nof the lower animals. Man completes the scale of higher organization. In\r\nhis physiological and pathological qualities, he scarcely presents to us\r\na distinct class of beings. As to what has brought him to this exalted\r\nobject of physical study, and has raised him to general scientific\r\ninvestigation, belongs principally to this society. Important as it\r\nis not to break that link which embraces equally the investigation\r\nof organic and inorganic nature, still the increasing ties and daily\r\ndevelopement of this institution renders it necessary, besides the\r\ngeneral meeting which is destined for these halls, to have specific\r\nmeetings for single branches of science. For it is only in such\r\ncontracted circles,--it is only among men whom reciprocity of studies\r\nhas brought together, that verbal discussions can take place. Without\r\nthis sort of communication, would the voluntary association of men in\r\nsearch of truth be deprived of an inspiring principle.\r\n\r\nAmong the preparations which are made in this city for the advancement\r\nof the society, attention has been principally paid to the possibility\r\nof such a subdivision into sections. The hope that these preparations\r\nwill meet with your approbation, imposes upon me the duty of reminding\r\nyou, that, although you had entrusted to two travellers, equally, the\r\nduty of making these arrangements, yet it is to one alone, my noble\r\nfriend, M. Lichtenstein, that the merit of careful precaution and\r\nindefatigable activity is due. Out of respect to the scientific spirit\r\nwhich animates the Society of German Naturalists and Natural Philosophy,\r\nand in acknowledgment of the utility of their efforts, government have\r\nseconded all our wishes with the greatest cheerfulness.\r\n\r\nIn the vicinity of the place of meeting, which has in this manner been\r\nprepared for our general and special labours, are situated the museums\r\ndedicated to anatomy, zoology, oryctognosy, and geology. They exhibit to\r\nthe naturalist a rich mine for observation and critical discussion. The\r\ngreater number of these well-arranged collections have existed, like\r\nthe University of Berlin, scarcely twenty years. The oldest of them, to\r\nwhich the Botanical Garden, (one of the richest in Europe) belongs, have\r\nduring this period not only been increased, but entirely remodelled. The\r\namusement and instruction derived from such institutions, call to our\r\nminds, with deep feelings of gratitude, that they are the work of that\r\ngreat monarch, who modestly and in simple grandeur, adorns every year\r\nthis royal city with new treasures of nature and art; and what is of\r\nstill greater value than the treasures themselves,--what inspires every\r\nPrussian with youthful strength, and with an enthusiastic love for the\r\nancient reigning family,--that he graciously attaches to himself every\r\nspecies of talent, and extends with confidence his royal protection to\r\nthe free cultivation of the understanding.\r\n\r\nThis was followed by a paper on magnetism, by Professor Oersted; and\r\nseveral other memoirs were then read.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of so many persons of similar pursuit, (for 464 members were\r\npresent,) rendered it convenient to have some ordinary, at which those\r\nwho chose might dine, and introduce their friends or families. This had\r\nbeen foreseen, and his Majesty had condescended to allow the immense\r\nbuilding used for the exercise of his troops, to be employed for this\r\npurpose. One-third of it was floored on the occasion, and tables were\r\narranged, at which, on one occasion, 850 persons sat down to dinner. On\r\nthe evening of the first day, M. de Humboldt gave a large SOIREE in the\r\nconcert rooms attached to the theatre. About 1200 persons assembled on\r\nthis occasion, and his Majesty the King of Prussia honoured with his\r\npresence the fete of his illustrious chamberlain. The nobility of the\r\ncountry, foreign princes, and foreign ambassadors, were present. It\r\nwas gratifying to observe the princes of the blood mingling with the\r\ncultivators of science, and to see the heir-apparent to the throne,\r\nduring the course of the evening, engaged in conversation with those\r\nmost celebrated for their talents, of his own, or of other countries.\r\n\r\nNor were the minor arrangements of the evening beneath the consideration\r\nof the President. The words of the music selected for the concert,\r\nwere printed and distributed to the visitors. The names of the most\r\nillustrious philosophers which Germany had produced, were inscribed in\r\nletters of gold at the end of the great concert room.\r\n\r\nIn the first rank amongst these stood a name which, England, too,\r\nenrolls amongst the brightest in her scientific annals; and proud, as\r\nwell she may be, of having fostered and brought to maturity the genius\r\nof the first Herschel, she has reaped an ample reward in being able to\r\nclaim as entirely her own, the inheritor of his talents and his name.\r\n\r\nThe six succeeding days were occupied, in the morning, by a meeting\r\nof the academy, at which papers of general interest were read. In\r\nthe afternoon, through the arrangement of M. de Humboldt and M.\r\nLichtenstein, various rooms were appropriated for different sections of\r\nthe academy. In one, the chemical philosophers attended to some\r\nchemical memoir, whilst the botanists assembled in another room, the\r\nphysiologists in a third, and the natural philosophers in a fourth. Each\r\nattended to the reading of papers connected with their several sciences.\r\nThus every member was at liberty to choose that section in which he felt\r\nmost interest at the moment, and he had at all times power of access to\r\nthe others. The evenings were generally spent at some of the SOIREES\r\nof the savans, resident at Berlin, whose hospitality and attentions to\r\ntheir learned brethren of other countries were unbounded. During the\r\nunoccupied hours of the morning, the collections of natural history,\r\nwhich are rapidly rising into importance, were open to examination; and\r\nthe various professors and directors who assisted the stranger in his\r\ninquiries, left him equally gratified by the knowledge and urbanity of\r\nthose who so kindly aided him.\r\n\r\nA map of Europe was printed, on which those towns only appeared which\r\nhad sent representatives to this scientific congress; and the numbers\r\nsent by different kingdoms appeared by the following table, which was\r\nattached to it;--\r\n\r\n     Russia.........  1\r\n     Austria........  0\r\n     England........  1\r\n     Holland........  2\r\n     Denmark........  7\r\n     France ........  1\r\n     Sardinia .......  0\r\n     Prussia........ 95\r\n     Bavaria........ 12\r\n     Hanover........  5\r\n     Saxony ........ 21\r\n     Wirtemburg ......  2\r\n     Sweden ........ 13\r\n     Naples ........  1\r\n     Poland ........  3\r\n     German States..... 43\r\n                            ---                       206\r\n     Berlin .......  172\r\n                            ---                       378\r\n\r\nThe proportion in which the cultivators of different sciences appeared,\r\nwas not easy to ascertain, because there were few amongst the more\r\neminent who had not added to more than one branch of human knowledge.\r\nThe following table, though not professing to be very accurate, will\r\nafford, perhaps, a tolerably fair view:--\r\n\r\n     Geometers.............  11\r\n     Astronomers...........   5\r\n     Natural Philosophers .  23\r\n                             -- 39\r\n\r\n     Mines............   5\r\n     Mineralogy ......  16\r\n     Geology..........   9\r\n                         -- 30\r\n\r\n     Chemistry........... 18\r\n     Geography...........  8\r\n     Anatomy............. 12\r\n\r\n     Zoology............  14\r\n     Natural History....   8\r\n     Botany.............. 35\r\n                          -- 57\r\n\r\n     Physicians.......   175\r\n     Amateurs  .......     9\r\n     Various .........    35\r\n                         ---381\r\n\r\nA medal was struck in commemoration of this meeting, and it was proposed\r\nthat it should form the first of a series, which should comprise all\r\nthose persons most celebrated for their scientific discoveries in the\r\npast and present age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX, No. 2.\r\n\r\nAn examination into some charges brought against one of the twenty-four\r\ncandidates, mentioned in a note as having their names suspended in the\r\nmeeting-room of the Royal Society, at one time, has caused a printed\r\npamphlet to be circulated amongst the members of the Society. Of the\r\ncharges themselves I shall offer no opinion, but entreat every member\r\nto judge for himself. I shall, however, make one extract, which tends to\r\nshow how the ranks of the Society are recruited.\r\n\r\nEXTRACT FROM A PRINTED LETTER FROM A. F. M. TO J. G. CHILDREN, ESQ.\r\nDATED, 22, UPPER BEDFORD-PLACE, MARCH 13, 1830.\r\n\r\n\"When I wished you to Propose me at the Geological Society, you asked me\r\nwhy you should not propose me also at the Royal Society; and my answer\r\nwas, that it was an honour to which I did not think I could aspire; that\r\nmy talents were too insignificant to warrant such pretensions. Many days\r\npassed, and still you pressed me on the subject, because your partiality\r\nmade you think me deserving of the honour; but I resisted, really\r\nthrough modesty, not that I did not covet the distinction, until\r\nsomething was said of my paper on the meteoric mass of iron of Brazil,\r\nwhich was published some years ago in the Transactions of the Royal\r\nSociety; when you insisted on proposing me, and I assented gratefully,\r\nbecause I was and am desirous of being a Fellow of the Royal Society, if\r\nI can be supposed worthy of having my name so honourably enrolled.\"\r\n\r\nEXTRACT FROM A LETTER OF J.

That similar applications were not unfrequently made in\r\nprivate, is well known; but it remains for the Society to consider\r\nwhether, now they are publicly and officially announced to them, it\r\nwill sanction this mode of augmenting the already numerous list of its\r\nfellows.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX, No. 3,\r\n\r\nLIST OF THE MEMBERS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY, WHO HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE\r\nPHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS, OR HAVE BEEN ON THE COUNCIL.\r\n\r\n\r\nN.

Hon. Chas.\r\n\r\nI had intended to have printed a list of those persons to whom the Royal\r\nSociety had in past years awarded the Copley medals, and the reasons for\r\nwhich they were given; but having applied to the Council for permission\r\nto employ an amanuensis, to copy those awards, either from the minutes,\r\nor from the volumes of the Philosophical Transactions, I was surprised\r\nat receiving a refusal. I confess it appeared to me, that as a whole,\r\nthose adjudications did us credit, although I doubted the propriety\r\nof many individual cases. As, however, the Council seem to have had a\r\ndifferent opinion, and as I had made the application through courtesy,\r\nI shall decline printing a list, every individual portion of which has\r\nbeen already published in many ways, although the whole has never been\r\nprinted in a collected form.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Decline of Science in England, by Charles Babbage",
