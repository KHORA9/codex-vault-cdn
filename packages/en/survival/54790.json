S. CROCKER & COMPANY, STATIONERS AND PRINTERS,\r\n  1890.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1890, by\r\n  GUSTAV EISEN,\r\n  in the office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf late years the raisin industry has been prominently before the\r\nhorticulturists of California. Many people now make their living and\r\nacquire wealth by the cultivation of the raisin grapes, and many are now\r\nstudying the methods of cultivation, pruning, curing and packing while\r\nwaiting for their vines to bear. The literature of the raisin industry\r\nis a very scant one, and, with the exception of a few notices in works\r\nof travel, or in treatises on general fruit culture, we find not a\r\nsingle book in which this important and interesting industry is made the\r\nspecial subject of study and discussion. A book on the raisin industry\r\nmay, therefore, be considered timely. I have endeavored to so write it\r\nthat it would contain something of interest to all those connected with\r\nthe growing and curing of the raisin grapes, to those who have already\r\nsucceeded in building up fame and fortune, as well as to those who have\r\njust begun the cultivation of the vine, and who have as yet only\r\nrealized the pleasures, but not the profits, of the industry. The\r\nhistorical part of the book will principally interest the former; for\r\nthe latter the practical part on cultivation, pruning, curing and\r\npacking is intended.\r\n\r\nAs our climate and other conditions differ from those of any other\r\ncountry in the world, so must our methods of cultivation and curing\r\ndiffer from those practiced elsewhere. Foreign methods, while\r\ninteresting and, in some respects, of great importance to us, had to be\r\ngreatly modified and improved upon before our growers succeeded in\r\nproducing raisins equaling the best from the raisin districts of the Old\r\nWorld. It has cost years of experimenting and study to attain success,\r\nas well as much money and disappointment to many who had nothing to\r\nguide them when they commenced.\r\n\r\nThese processes by which success was achieved can now become the\r\nproperty of all, and a safe guide to even the most inexperienced\r\nbeginners. The methods advocated here are the result of practical\r\nexperience of the author, as well as of the most successful\r\nraisin-growers of this State.\r\n\r\nFor the benefit of those of our readers who now study the raisin\r\nindustry at a distance, but whose steps may in the future be directed to\r\nthis Coast, a descriptive tour through the raisin districts of our State\r\nhas been added in order that they may see what our country is like,--the\r\ncountry of the raisin and the fig; the country of almonds, olives,\r\noranges and prunes; the country where health, profit and enjoyment are\r\nmore than anywhere else derived from horticultural pursuits. It is for\r\nthese prospective readers, that the short biographical sketches of our\r\nprincipal raisin-men are intended,--short records of the pioneers of the\r\nraisin industry,--men who have broken the way which is now easy to\r\ntravel, and through whose experience and perseverance others are now\r\nbeing benefited.\r\n\r\n  GUSTAV EISEN.\r\n\r\n  SAN FRANCISCO, CAL., OCTOBER, 1890.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE OF CONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                   PAGE.\r\n  HISTORICAL                                                           5\r\n\r\n      Raisins                                                          5\r\n\r\n      The Currant                                                      6\r\n\r\n      Muscatels                                                        7\r\n\r\n      Dehesa Raisins                                                   7\r\n\r\n      Lexias or Lye-dipped Raisins                                     9\r\n\r\n      Various Kinds of Raisins                                        10\r\n      --Muscatels;

Thus Falstaff replies to Prince\r\nHal: “If reasons were as plentiful as blackberries, I would give no man\r\na reason upon compulsion” (Henry IV, Act II, scene 4). Also, Cooper, in\r\nhis dictionary of 1685, indicates that “_raisin_” and “_reason_” are of\r\nidentical sounds. The derivation of the word has, again, been very\r\nvariously suggested either from “red” or “rose” color, connecting it\r\nwith the German and Danish word “_rosine_;” and it has even been\r\nsuggested that the word was derived from the fact that the raisins were\r\ncured in the “rays” of the sun. The true derivation, however, is from\r\nthe Latin word “_racemus_,” meaning a bunch or cluster. Richardson, who\r\nfirst points out this derivation, quotes: “Whether a reisyn (E. V.\r\ngraap, _racemus_) of Effraym is not better than the vindages of Abiezer”\r\n(Wicliffe Judges VIIJ, 2). “And there shall be left in it as a rasyn”\r\n(E. V., braunches of a cluster). Marginal note, “A rasyn is a lytil bow\r\nwith a lytil fruit” (Idem. Is., XVIJ., 6). But we have much older\r\ntestimony of this derivation being the correct one. An old document\r\nstates that, in 1265 A. D., the Countess of Leicester paid in London\r\ntwelve shillings for fourteen pounds, or, as the statement reads in\r\nLatin, “_Pro uno fraello racemorum_;” which, translated, would be, “for\r\none frail of bunches.” The evolution of the Latin word _racemus_ was\r\nthus seen to have been accomplished rapidly enough; but, on account of\r\nthe illiteracy of the olden times, it was spelled and pronounced\r\npromiscuously. Thus we meet with such spellings as “_reysyns_,” in 1266;\r\n“_reysons_,” in 1447 (“Russell’s Book of Nurture”). In 1554 the\r\n_Stationers’ Company_ in London paid twopence for one pound of “_greate\r\nreasons_;” while Andrew Borde, in his “Dietary” of 1542, says that\r\n“_great raysens be nutrytyve, specyally yf the stones be pulled out_.”\r\nIn 1578 Dodoens speaks of dried raysens. In 1685 the word “raisin” is\r\nused and spelled as in our days, and from that time on the different\r\nspellings were used, if not promiscuously, still without any great\r\nuniformity. The term of “greate raysens” was introduced to distinguish\r\nthem from the smaller raisins, or currants. In our own days, the latter\r\nis seldom classed or alluded to as a “raisin” proper, although it,\r\nstrictly speaking, should be considered as such. The tendency at present\r\nin California is to make the distinction between “raisins” and “dried\r\ngrapes,” meaning by the former certain varieties of grapes which have\r\nbeen skillfully dried and cured, and which are superior in taste,\r\nflavor, thinness of skin and saccharine matter. “Dried grapes,” again,\r\nare simply any kind of grape, especially wine-grapes, which have only\r\nbeen dried, and which have not undergone that skillful treatment which\r\nthe grape-grower is so proud of, and justly enough designates as\r\n“curing.” They are an outgrowth from the late efforts of the French wine\r\nmerchants to make genuine French wine out of anything that is sweet, and\r\nas they are immensely preferable to beets, potatoes and glucose, they\r\nwill always be in demand.\r\n\r\nWith the above definition of the “raisin” accepted, we can proceed to\r\nconsider their different varieties, their names and derivations. The old\r\ndesignations of the different varieties were derived from the places\r\nwhere they were produced, without special reference to the grapes from\r\nwhich the raisins were made. Thus we had Malagas, Currants, Valencias,\r\nDenias, Turkish and Italian raisins. But since it has been found that\r\nthe same kinds of raisins have been produced in very different\r\nlocalities, and that some localities can produce all the different\r\nkinds, a new division has been found necessary. Thus, disregarding the\r\nmany various brands with which this and other markets are flooded, the\r\nfollowing different varieties of raisins will be found the principal\r\nones: _Currants_, _Muscatels_, _Dipped_ and _Sultana_.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CURRANT.\r\n\r\nThe _currant_ is one of the very oldest raisins known. As early as 75 A.\r\nD. Pliny speaks of the fine grapes grown in Greece, the berry being\r\nthin-skinned, juicy and sweet, and the bunch being exceedingly small.\r\nThis, then, must be the currant of later times. After this first mention\r\nof this grape, the same drops out of history for ten centuries, and the\r\nname currant is first to be identified with raisins de Corauntz, or\r\nrather, “reysyns de _Corauntzs_” as late as 1334. As early as the\r\neleventh century, a lively traffic in this kind of raisins had taken\r\nplace between the Greek producers, the _Venetians_ and other of the\r\nMediterranean merchant nations. In 1334 we find them called “corauntz;”\r\nin 1435, “corent;” and old MS. of the Grocers’ Company in London, speaks\r\nof “x butts and vi roundelletts of resins of Corent.” Thus spelled, the\r\nname was used for years. In 1463 “reysonys of Corawnce” were three pence\r\nper pound, and in 1512 the Duke of Northumberland paid two pence per\r\npound for rasyns of Corens. In 1554 the name had changed to currans, and\r\nthe Stationers’ Company provided for a banquet “5 punde of currans at\r\none shilling and eight pence.” In 1558 the same company provided for “6\r\npunde of currance for 2 shillings.” In 1578 we find in Lytes’\r\ntranslation of Dodoens’s “Herbal,” in the description of different\r\nvarieties of vines, that “Small raysens, commonly called Corantes, but\r\nmore rightly raysens of Corinthe. The fruit is called in the shoppes of\r\nthe countrie,[1] passulae de Corinthe; in French, raisins de Corinthe;\r\nin base Almaigne (Dutch) Corinthea; in English, Currantes, and small\r\nraysens of Corynthe.” Here, then, is indicated for the first time that\r\nthe true and correct name should be “raisins of Corinth.” But we need\r\nnot follow this evolution any longer; there can be no possible doubt\r\nthat the name _currant_, the one now accepted for this class of raisins,\r\nis derived from the town of Corinth, on the mainland of Greece,--the\r\nMorea of our days, the Peloponnesus of the ancients. Until the time when\r\nthe Turks conquered Greece, the port of Corinth was the principal point\r\nof export for this class of raisins, and while, after the subjection of\r\nGreece this commerce entirely ceased, still this fruit always continued\r\nto bear the name by which it first became known to commerce.\r\n\r\n  [1] Holland, Dodoens was a learned Dutch botanist.\r\n\r\n\r\nMUSCATELS.\r\n\r\nThe principal and most valued class of raisins are the Muscatels or\r\nMuscats. They all derive their name from the Muscatel or Muscat grape,\r\nfrom which these raisins are made. As to the origin of the name Muscat,\r\nopinions differ. The most popular one is that the grape got its name\r\nfrom the supposed musky flavor peculiar to this variety of grape. It is,\r\nhowever, far more likely that the name is a very ancient one, and\r\nderived from the Latin word _Musca_, meaning a fly,--these fine grapes\r\nwhen drying being especially attractive to flies. The Romans called this\r\ngrape, “Uva Apiaria,” meaning bee grapes, or grapes beloved by bees,\r\nfrom the fact that the bees are especially attracted to these grapes\r\nwhen they are being dried. The Muscat or Muscatel would then not\r\noriginally designate a certain variety of grapes, but grapes used for\r\ndrying generally. In the course of time the name was transferred to or\r\nespecially given to the _best_ grape for drying purposes,--the Muscatel\r\nof our own times.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEHESA RAISINS.\r\n\r\nThe finest or at least the most expensive brand of raisins made is the\r\n_Dehesa_ raisin of Malaga. They are produced from the Muscatel variety\r\nand the name they bear has an interesting origin, giving us at the same\r\ntime an insight in the development of the agricultural and horticultural\r\nresources of Spain. The word “Dehesa” is found by reference to a good\r\nSpanish dictionary to mean pasture ground. The “Dehesa” raisins then are\r\npasture-ground raisins, or raisins grown on former pasture ground. The\r\nway the raisins came to be given such a name is as follows. Between the\r\nyears 800 and the end of the fifteenth century, the fairest part of\r\nSpain as well as Portugal was occupied by the Moors. Contrary to their\r\nnature in other countries, they proved here extremely industrious, and\r\nexcelled both as merchants, artisans and agriculturists. The waters of\r\nthe streams were conducted to the land in aqueducts, dams were thrown\r\nacross the rivers, reservoirs were formed, and the whole of Southern\r\nSpain became most highly cultivated, rich and prosperous. In fact, if\r\nthe historians are to be believed, and the yet remaining views of former\r\ngrandeur can be trusted, no country either in ancient or modern times\r\nhas ever in prosperity rivaled the ancient Moorish kingdoms of Granada\r\nand Andalusia. In the thirteenth century the Christian knights and kings\r\nof Central and Northern Spain succeeded in conquering the Moors, who\r\nagain were unmercifully expelled, massacred or enslaved, their cities\r\nburned and razed, and the fertile and cultivated districts utterly\r\nruined. Vast tracts were depopulated and abandoned, and, nature taking\r\nits course, wild grass, shrubbery and trees soon covered the former\r\nhighly cultivated plains. In the course of time these uncultivated lands\r\nattracted the attention of the highland shepherds, who drove their herds\r\nto them during the winters, again returning to the mountains at the\r\nadvent of the dry season.\r\n\r\nBy degrees the self-taken rights of the sheepmen became more widely\r\nrecognized, and, while the less valuable lands were taken possession of\r\nby the poorer peasantry, these pasture lands were set apart for the\r\nexclusive use of the sheep-owners. The pasture lands thus being free, it\r\nwas no wonder that the sheep industry flourished, and that the flocks\r\nincreased. The wool industry soon became one of the most important in\r\nSpain. The flocks were principally owned by nobles and monks, and the\r\npoor peasants, who constituted the only agricultural population, had\r\nvery little if any chance to oppose the ever greater encroachments of\r\nthe wandering flocks or their insolent owners. The Merinos, or moving\r\nsheep, were wintered in the warm valleys of Andalusia, Murcia and\r\nEstremadura, only to be again removed to the cooler mountains of Leon\r\nand Castille at the advent of spring. What curse this would entail on\r\nthe agricultural population is easy to be seen. The sheep were moving in\r\nbands of 10,000 each, and 700 to 800 such flocks were moved annually\r\ntwice through a country devoid of fences or inclosures of any kind.\r\nNumerous disputes and constant bloody fights arose between farmers and\r\nthe shepherd, to settle which the “Council of the Mesta” was instituted.\r\nIn tyranny, this dreaded institution was only equaled by the famous\r\nInquisition, with which in birth and death it was almost\r\ncontemporaneous. In the year 1556 a code of laws was promulgated, and a\r\ncompromise was entered upon. But the tyranny of the shepherds, upheld\r\nthrough their “Mesta,” was in no way diminished. The latter continually\r\nextended its power, encroached upon new territory, appropriating\r\ngradually the finest pastures of Spain, and finally obtained a monopoly\r\nof the wool trade. Its tyranny became at last intolerable. The shepherds\r\nof the Mesta were more dreaded than robbers and highwaymen in every\r\nplace through which they passed. Agriculture became almost impossible.\r\nAt last the “Mesta” was abolished by the Cortez in Cadiz in 1812, and a\r\nfew years afterwards the pastures or Dehesas were sold. One of the\r\nfinest Dehesas near Velez, Malaga, was planted to Muscatel grapes, and\r\nthrough the combined fertility of the soil, and the abundance of\r\nmoisture, the vineyard proved a great success. So fine were the grapes\r\ngrown there that they attracted great attention; no such fine grapes had\r\never been seen in Andalusia before. The merchants to whom the first\r\nraisins were sold were much astonished, and wonderingly asked whence\r\nthey came. The reply, “from the Dehesa,” was from that time on applied\r\nto the finest Muscatel grapes.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEXIAS, OR LYE-DIPPED, AND OTHER RAISINS.\r\n\r\nThe third class of raisins are the _dipped_ raisins, so called from\r\nbeing dipped in boiling lye before being dried and cured. The Spanish\r\nname for these raisins is _Lexias_. The name _Lexia_ is, again, derived\r\nfrom a more ancient word, the Latin _lixivium_, or _lixia_, meaning\r\n_lye_. To-day the continental name for this class of raisin is _Lexias_,\r\nwhen the more specific names of Denias and Valencias are not used. Here,\r\nin America, we generally use these names, and whenever we speak of\r\nValencias and Denias we mean the dipped raisins of these districts. To\r\nthe above three classes of raisins we might appropriately add Sultanas\r\nand Malagas. The Sultanas are made from the Sultana grape, a seedless\r\ngrape from Asia Minor, now grown in many Mediterranean countries, as\r\nwell as here in California. The Malagas, again, were originally the\r\nMuscatels grown around Malaga, in Spain; but of late this name is being,\r\nwith considerable confusion, applied to a coarser raisin made in\r\nCalifornia from a grape here called, for want of a better name, the\r\nMalaga grape.\r\n\r\nAmong names which were formerly much used, but which have gone out of\r\nuse, was the Solis, or sun-dried raisins, especially the sun-dried\r\nMuscatels of Malaga. As early as 1295 A. D., the Muscatels were\r\ngenerally called thus: Raisins of the sun; Solis, or sun-dried, so as to\r\ndistinguish them from the inferior dipped, or Lexias. In our own time,\r\nthis name was nearly being revived, when a couple of years ago our\r\nCalifornia _sun-dried_ raisins were spoken of in opposition to our\r\n_machine-dried_ raisins, and when both classes had their earnest and\r\nenthusiastic champions.\r\n\r\nWe cannot leave this chapter on names without referring to classes of\r\nraisins receiving their names from certain localities. Of course, the\r\nnumber of such names may be almost endless. It is, however, only of\r\ninterest to refer to the principal ones, such as have been known to\r\ncommerce in former days or are yet known. Thus, we designate as Malagas\r\nany of the raisins grown and shipped from Malaga. The Smyrnas (formerly\r\nSmirna) are those from Smyrna, in Asia Minor, both sun-dried and dipped\r\nraisins; the Alicantes, dipped raisins, from Alicante, in Spain; the\r\nDenias, dipped raisins from Denia, in Spain; the Valencias, dipped\r\nraisins from Valencia (include Denias); the Lipari, raisins from the\r\nIsland of Lipari, near Sicily; the Belvideres, from the same island and\r\nfrom the Island of Pantellaria; the Calabrian raisins, from Calabria, in\r\nItaly; the Faro raisins, from the port of Faro, in Algarve, Portugal. We\r\nhave above already referred to the currants, from the town of Corinth\r\nand the Grecian Islands, and the Malagas, from Malaga. The latter were\r\nalso known as “great raisins,” on account of their superior quality.\r\nAmong the latter we should, of course, count the California raisins;\r\nbut, unfortunately, our raisin-growers have not until quite recently\r\nrecognized the necessity of adopting names which should at once show the\r\nlocality where the raisins are produced. But we will return to this\r\nfurther on.\r\n\r\n\r\nVARIOUS KINDS OF RAISINS.\r\n\r\n_a._ _Sun-dried_ raisins.\r\n\r\n1. _Muscatels_, or Muscats, from Malaga or California. The former, also\r\nknown at various periods as “Solis,” or sun-dried, or “great raisins,”\r\non account of their very superior qualities.\r\n\r\n2. _Currants_, raisins made of the small currant grape, originally from\r\nCorinth.\r\n\r\n3. _Belvideres_, raisins from Calabria, in Italy, and from the Islands\r\nof Lipari and Pantellaria, near Sicily.\r\n\r\n4. _Black Smyrna_, properly only a dried grape, not exported to this\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n5. California _Malagas_, made from the Malaga grape.\r\n\r\n6. California sun-dried _Sultanas_, made from the Sultana grapes in this\r\nState. And, lastly,--\r\n\r\n7. _Seedless Muscatels_, made in California, and being the smallest\r\nMuscats separated from the larger seed-bearing berries.\r\n\r\n8. _Thompson Seedless_, a new, very promising raisin now being produced\r\nin this country from vines imported originally from Constantinople,\r\nproducing seedless grapes, slightly larger than the Sultanas.\r\n\r\n9. _Dried grapes_ of any description, especially wine grapes, exported\r\nfrom this and Mediterranean countries for wine-making to France, England\r\nand the Eastern States.\r\n\r\n_b._ _Dipped_ raisins.\r\n\r\n10. _Lexias_, or Dipped Muscatels, from Denia, Valencia, Alicante, in\r\nSpain.\r\n\r\n11. California Dipped, especially second-crop Muscatels. Proper name not\r\nyet established.\r\n\r\n12. Smyrnas, which again may be either _Sultanas_, _Chesmes_ or\r\n_Elemês_. The first from the Sultana grape, the two latter, the “red”\r\ngrapes, from Dipped Muscatels.\r\n\r\n13. _Faros_, from Algarve, in Portugal, not known in this country.\r\n\r\n_c._ _Dried in the shade._\r\n\r\n14. _Huasco_ raisin, from Chile. To this list might be added many more\r\nvarieties of less importance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRAISIN DISTRICTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_FOREIGN DISTRICTS._\r\n\r\n\r\nRAISINS IN ANCIENT TIMES.\r\n\r\nPrevious to the production of raisins in California within the last\r\ntwenty years, the raisin industry of the world was entirely confined to\r\nthe Mediterranean district of Europe and Asia. At that period, however,\r\nraisin grapes became more disseminated, and raisins were produced to\r\nbegin with in small quantities in widely distant countries, such as\r\nChile, Australia and California. By virtue of their climatic conditions,\r\nthe Mediterranean countries were the only parts of Europe where raisin\r\nculture could be successfully carried on, though it is almost certain\r\nthat the original home of the raisin grapes must be looked for\r\nelsewhere. In searching for the original habitat for the ancient\r\nvarieties of raisin grapes, we must look further east to ancient Persia,\r\nor to the tablelands of Western Asia generally. In remotest antiquity,\r\ngrape culture was carried on there, and in the ancient records of\r\ntravelers in those countries we find mentioned dried and seedless\r\ngrapes. We can trace the origin of two varieties of raisin grapes to the\r\nbeginning of our era, which must then already have attained perfection.\r\nAs has been mentioned before, Pliny spoke of a small, sweet and\r\nremarkable grape grown by the Greeks, evidently the “currant;” he also\r\nmentions _Uva Zibebae_ and _Uva Alexandria_.\r\n\r\nThe Latins generally spoke of Uvae Apiariae or Uvae Muscae, our present\r\nMuscatels or dried grapes generally. This carries us back fully nineteen\r\ncenturies. But we may well believe, even in want of records, that the\r\ndrying of grapes was practiced centuries before.\r\n\r\n\r\nMODERN RAISIN DISTRICTS.\r\n\r\nLeaving remote antiquity, it was only in the Mediterranean basin, and in\r\ncomparatively modern times, that the drying of grapes developed to an\r\nimportant industry, and in more recent times yet that grapes were\r\nexported to Northern Europe. While thus the industry is old, it was not\r\nuntil the eleventh century, at the time of the Crusades, that it became\r\nimportant. The returning knights brought with them taste for and\r\nacquaintance with the products of the East. Northern Europe became the\r\nconsumers of raisins, regarding them as the greatest luxuries, only to\r\nbe afforded by the rich. It has been reserved for our time to make the\r\nraisin a necessity even in humbler homes. The perfection to which the\r\nraisin industry has attained is of modern origin not yet half a century\r\nold.\r\n\r\nThe raisin districts of the world are not large, and while for centuries\r\nevery effort was made to extend the planting of raisin grapes and their\r\ncuring into raisins, few of these efforts have been crowned with\r\nsuccess. While raisin grapes may grow and be turned into raisins in\r\nalmost every part of the Mediterranean basin, experience has\r\ndemonstrated that it has only proved a paying business in comparatively\r\nfew localities. The reasons of this are not fully apparent; but they are\r\nevidently dependent both upon climatic conditions and upon the\r\ncapability of the natives to learn and profit by the experiences of\r\nothers, and upon their enterprise in venturing upon a new industry. On\r\nthe other hand, it is not likely that, even with extensive experiments\r\nand with the aid of large capital, the growing and curing of the raisin\r\ngrapes could be very extensively extended. The question there as well as\r\nhere is not one alone of agricultural consideration, but a financial\r\nproblem dependent upon the labor supply, the facilities for shipping,\r\nclimatic conditions during the curing season, etc. Such being the case,\r\nall the more interest is attached to those localities and districts\r\nwhere the raisin industry flourishes, and where there is every\r\nprobability that it will remain a success.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MALAGA DISTRICT.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Extent and Age of the District._--Malaga has been known to export\r\nraisins since 1295 A. D., but must have been a raisin-producing district\r\ncenturies before. The raisin cult, then, is no doubt of Phœnician\r\norigin, and has been practiced in the same locality for two thousand\r\nyears or more. Under the Romans the raisin industry was continued, but\r\nappears to have deteriorated and later on to have been abandoned\r\naltogether, as the local tradition credits the Moors with having\r\nre-introduced the raisin grape into Velez Malaga. The raisin district of\r\nMalaga extends along the southern coast of Spain for a distance of sixty\r\nor seventy miles. The district is subdivided into several other\r\ndistricts. Thus, the subdistrict of Malaga proper occupies a plain\r\neighteen miles long by nine miles wide, in the northeast corner of which\r\nis situated the town of Malaga.\r\n\r\nThe best part of the whole district is, however, found at Velez Malaga,\r\nsituated northeast of Malaga proper. It was here the raisin grape was\r\nfirst planted by the Romans or Phœnicians, and it was here also the\r\ndevastating phylloxera first made its appearance. The raisin vineyards\r\nextend here not over a _vega_ or plain, but occupy the fertile country\r\nalong the coast or the litoral towards Malaga proper.\r\n\r\nBeyond Velez Malaga to Algaroba, the Muscatel grape is of inferior\r\nquality, and is greatly superseded by the red Muscats, principally\r\nexported to France.\r\n\r\nAnother district is _Marbella_, on the coast, and in the interior we\r\nfind _Ronda_ and _Albuñol_. Of the principal towns in these districts,\r\nthe population of Malaga is 120,000, that of Velez Malaga 24,000, of\r\nMarbella 7,700, and of Ronda 19,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Climate._--The climate of Malaga is the very mildest. Frost is almost\r\nunknown, and is never heavy. The average temperature of Malaga during\r\nthe winter months of November to January is 56 degrees Fahrenheit, while\r\nthat of Pau in France is 41, and that of Nice 47. Malaga is well\r\nsheltered on the north and east by mountains, but is open to the south.\r\nIt is the most equitable climate of Europe, although the winds are\r\nsometimes trying. The summer is very tempered. The air is, however,\r\nmoist, and fog, while rare, is not entirely absent. Rain sometimes falls\r\nduring the growing season of the grapes, and quite frequently during the\r\ndrying season. But the fog is warm and not specially injurious to the\r\ngrapes, the latter often growing within reach of the spray on the\r\nseashore.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Soil._--The soil of the Malaga vineyards varies considerably, the best\r\nbeing a reddish clayey loam with much sand and gravel. But we have also\r\nother varieties of soil, such as the white ash, gray alluvial soils, and\r\nthe very sandy loam on the hills.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Location of the Vineyards._--In former years, the vineyards were\r\nprincipally located on the hillsides, only occasionally extending to the\r\nlevel plains. Of late, however, the hillside vineyards have suffered\r\nfrom the phylloxera and various other diseases, and many of them have\r\nbeen dug up. The lowland vineyards are now the best, although even they\r\nare, by far, not free from disease. Few of the vineyards are located on\r\nentirely level ground, there being but little such in the district. The\r\nnature of the country is rolling, with small valleys or flats. The\r\nraisin grapes grow apparently well both inland and on the coast.\r\nAccording to Consul Marston, about eighty per cent of the vineyards are\r\nsituated on rolling land, ten per cent on lowland and ten per cent on\r\nthe very coast. The vineyards on the coast are actually within reach of\r\nthe spray.\r\n\r\nThe vineyards are generally small, none being over eighty acres in\r\nextent. Most contain, perhaps, from three to four acres each; while from\r\ntwenty to forty acres is considered a good-sized vineyard.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Varieties of Grapes._--The principal variety used is the Gordo Blanco\r\nor Muscatel. It is identical with the grape known by us under that name,\r\nand which was imported to us from Malaga. But several types are found,\r\nalthough none superior to the Gordo Blanco.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Characteristics of the Raisins._--The Malaga raisins were, until\r\nlately, the finest raisins in the world, and for the present have only\r\nthe California raisins to compete with. They are characterized by great\r\nsweetness, deep bluish color, great size and by good keeping qualities.\r\nThe best raisins are those called Dehesas, being produced on the valley\r\nlands of the districts.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Yield of Grapes._--The yield of Malaga vineyards varies of course. The\r\nbest yield eight or nine tons of grapes to the acre,--just like those of\r\nCalifornia. But there is a great difference between new and old\r\nvineyards. In many vineyards where formerly the yield was nine tons, the\r\nsoil has been so exhausted by continuous croppings that to-day, even\r\nwith manuring, two or three tons of grapes must be considered a high\r\nyield.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Distances of the Vines._--The older vineyards had their vines set seven\r\nfeet by seven feet, but of late the vines are planted generally eight\r\nfeet by four feet, thus much closer than by us in California.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pruning._--The pruning of the vineyard is performed very much as in\r\nCalifornia. Formerly the soil had to be removed from the vines before\r\nthey could be pruned; now this is not necessary except while the vines\r\nare very young. The various branches are pruned back to a few inches,\r\nwith two eyes each, while the heads are elevated only a few inches above\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Manuring and Fertilizing._--The Malaga vineyardist fully understands\r\nthe value of manuring his vineyards, and uses for this purpose not only\r\nall fertilizers available at home, but also imports directly from\r\ndistant countries. The most valued fertilizers are the Mexican and\r\nChilean guanos or phosphates. The Mexican phosphate costs in Malaga\r\nsixty-five dollars per ton; still it is used by all the principal\r\nvineyardists, who know the value of fertilizers. In fact, concentrated\r\nfertilizers are a necessity to the Malaga vineyards; without them they\r\ncould not be cropped. Even the most virgin soil is exhausted in ten\r\nyears’ time by constant croppings of raisin grapes; no paying crops\r\ncould be expected if fertilizers were not used yearly. This fertilizing\r\nof the soil is, however, of recent origin, and fifty years ago was\r\nalmost unknown.\r\n\r\nWhen home manures are used, it is placed in holes dug round the roots of\r\nthe vines, which, after exposure to the air for several months, are\r\nagain filled up at the advent of spring, generally in March, before the\r\nvines start to bud.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Drying-floors, or Sequeros._--The raisins, when picked, are dried on\r\nso-called _sequeros_, or drying-floors, characteristic of the Malaga\r\ndistrict. These floors are of different sizes and lengths in different\r\nvineyards, but everywhere constructed on the same general principles.\r\nWhere an incline or a hill is found, the floor may simply be built on\r\nthe slope, with no artificial elevation; but, where the ground is level,\r\nthe structure of the _sequero_ is different. The floor must always face\r\nthe south, and the back is raised to give the floor the proper slope.\r\nThe _sequero_ thus consists of four walls, the front one of which is\r\nonly a foot high, and the back wall from six to eight feet high. The\r\nside walls slope between these, generally with an angle of forty-five\r\ndegrees. In length, these floors vary from forty to fifty feet,\r\naccording to the different ideas of the vineyardists. The whole interior\r\nis filled with black gravel, and is tamped hard. These _sequeros_ are\r\ndivided in beds, fourteen feet or so wide, by tiles that are sunk, thus\r\nforming walks of several feet in width, and which also serve for leading\r\noff the rainwater. Around every little bed of this kind are small\r\nupright tiles to prevent the rainwater entering from the walks. Finally,\r\nin the center of the bed, is a long row of upright tiles, high enough to\r\nsupport either boards, mats, or more generally canvas, in order that\r\nthey may shed the rain into the tile walks. The value of such floors is\r\nevident. Being covered with canvas, etc., every night, the heat is\r\npreserved, and every morning, when the sun rises, the grapes are yet\r\nwarm. The drying on such beds has never, in fact, been interrupted. The\r\ndrying-floors are also useful in case of too hot weather, when the\r\ngrapes can be properly sheltered with canvas and prevented from being\r\ncooked; when finally dried, the covering, again, will serve to keep the\r\nmoisture from too quickly evaporating.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Drying and Curing._--When the grapes are picked, the best vineyardists\r\nseparate the bunches immediately in three different grades. Each grade\r\nis placed by itself on the gravelly drying-ground, and remains there to\r\ndry. When half dried, they are taken bunch by bunch by a workman, who\r\npicks out bad or overdried berries and rubbish, and in putting the bunch\r\nback turns it over. In ten days the grapes are generally dried, provided\r\nthe weather has been favorable. Every night the canvas covering is slid\r\ndown over the _sequero_, and the grapes protected from dew and cold, or\r\nrain. The drying is sometimes greatly hastened by the _Terral_ or hot\r\nwinds blowing from the plains of La Mancha, a wind very similar in its\r\neffect to the desert wind of Riverside and Santa Ana, in California.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Packing._--The raisins in Malaga are packed by the large growers\r\nthemselves, and every such grower packs almost to a man. The generally\r\naccepted idea that a few packers living in Malaga pack all the raisins\r\nis erroneous. This is not the case.[2] Nearly all packers there are also\r\ngrowers owning their own vineyards. The raisins are all packed in\r\n22-pound boxes or in quarters, etc., according to the demands of the\r\ntrade.\r\n\r\n  [2] According to A. B. Butler.\r\n\r\nThe various raisin brands packed in Malaga are different according to\r\nthe different markets that are to be supplied. Thus for England we have:\r\nFinest Dehesa, three crown; finest Dehesa, two crown; finest Dehesa, one\r\ncrown; Dehesa; Choice layers; London layers, three crown; London layers,\r\ntwo crown; London layers, one crown.\r\n\r\nFor France again we have: 1 Imperiaux; 1 Royaux; Couches; Surchoix;\r\nChoix; Ordinaire; Surcouches, etc.\r\n\r\nThe loose raisins or _Brena_ and the seedless or _Escombro_ generally go\r\nto the continent or even to the United States. The old terms Garoon or\r\nSun are now never used.\r\n\r\nFor American markets we have: Imperial Dehesa; Royal finest Dehesa;\r\nfinest Dehesa; fine Dehesa; Dehesa; London layers, three crown; London\r\nlayers, two crown; London loose, one, two and three crown.\r\n\r\nBoxes are generally made from fir imported from Portugal, at fifteen\r\ncents each. Of late years, however, they are also received from Canada,\r\nand cost only seven cents each.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Labor._--The labor in Malaga is the most expensive in Spain, the best\r\nlaborer being paid forty cents per day, while in Denia the labor is\r\nobtained for fifteen cents only; but it must be remembered that the\r\npacking of the Malaga raisins is a much more particular work than the\r\npacking of the dipped Denias.\r\n\r\nThe price paid for Malaga raisins at the packing-house is at an average\r\nof seven cents per pound for the best, or from one to two cents more\r\nthan what is paid in California. The lower grades bring from two and a\r\nhalf cents upwards.\r\n\r\n\r\nVALENCIA AND DENIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Extent of the Districts._--The Valencia raisins, or, as they are\r\ncalled, the Lexias or Spanish dipped raisins, are produced in the\r\nprovince of Valencia, situated on the east coast of Spain. The district\r\ncontains three sub-districts, the southern one, the Alicante district,\r\nextending from Villa Joyosa in the north to Elche in the south. The\r\nraisins of the Alicante district are inferior to those produced in the\r\nother districts, both as regards quality and quantity. The most\r\nnortherly district is the Valencia district proper, extending from\r\nCullera in the south to Castellon in the north. North of the latter\r\nplace the Muscat grape does not come to perfection, and even within this\r\ndistrict comparatively few raisins are now produced as compared with a\r\nfew years ago. But the bulk of all the raisins produced in the province\r\nare exported from Valencia city, and hence these raisins are known as\r\nValencias, while in reality they come principally from Denia.\r\n\r\nThe bulk of the Valencia raisins come from the central district, or the\r\nDenia sub-district, comprising the land between Villa Joyosa in the\r\nsouth and Cullera in the north, or about thirty miles on each side of\r\nthe town of Denia. Towards the interior the raisin district extends at\r\nthe most nine miles, but the average is less, so that the whole district\r\nover which the Denia vineyards are spread includes only an area of 350\r\nsquare miles, equal to ten townships of land, or about 224,000 acres. A\r\nlarge part of this land is not cultivated, and consists of mountains and\r\nwaste places only suitable as watersheds. The town of Denia is the\r\nprincipal town of the sub-district, and has now a population of about\r\n2,600 people. It is situated about half way between Valencia in the\r\nnorth and Alicante in the south, on the shore of the Mediterranean, in\r\nabout the latitude of Sacramento in California, or thirty-eight degrees,\r\nfifty minutes north. Being one of the oldest towns in Spain, Denia was\r\nfirst founded by the Phœnicians, who here established the worship of\r\nDiana, from which word the name Denia is a corruption. The Phœnicians\r\nalso introduced the grapes, and possibly also the drying of raisins; but\r\nthe local tradition gives the honor of the latter industry to the Moors,\r\nwho are said to have brought with them the variety of grape known as the\r\nMuscat of Alexandria. During a part of the year, Denia is the export\r\nharbor for the raisins of the district. This is only possible in the\r\nearly part of the raisin season, as then only are the winds\r\nfavorable,--the so-called harbor being nothing but a roadstead. Later in\r\nthe season, when storms and rains set in, all the raisins are shipped to\r\nValencia by railroad, and from there exported by steamers and sailing\r\nvessels.\r\n\r\nAmong other industries of the Denia district are the cultivation of\r\nonions, the manufacture of cotton goods, its sardine fisheries, etc.,\r\nall giving work to the vineyard workers during a time of the year when\r\nthere is nothing or but little to do in the vineyards and\r\npacking-houses.\r\n\r\nThe raisins of Denia are not all of the same quality, but vary according\r\nto the locality where grown. The whole district is dotted with small\r\nvillages, all producing raisins. The principal ones of these are,\r\nbesides Denia proper, Jabea, Jaraco, Jerrea, Oliva, Pedreguer, Jalon,\r\nGandia, Ondara, Vergel, etc. Of these, Denia proper produced in 1876\r\nover 2,500 tons of raisins, Jabea 1,700 tons, Oliva 1,600 tons,\r\nPedreguer 1,000 tons, Retoria 900 tons, Jalon 850 tons, Ondara and\r\nBenisa 800 tons each. But, besides these, there are some twenty odd more\r\nvillages or smaller raisin centers, which produce from 200 to 700 tons\r\neach, or an aggregate of 20,000 tons of raisins.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Soils and Appearance of the Districts._--The soils of the province of\r\nValencia, where the vineyards are situated, are of various kinds, such\r\nas cretaceous and calcareous soils, containing admixtures of clay, sand\r\nand gravel. The color is often red, changing to gray where irrigation\r\nhas been practiced, but much of the soil is of an ashy white color,\r\nsimilar to that of bottom lands generally. In many of the lower situated\r\nplains, the soils are blackish or dark gray, especially so where stable\r\nor other manures have been used for years.\r\n\r\nMany vineyards are situated on the hillsides or on the rolling lands,\r\nwhere the gravelly soils produce raisins of smaller size and in less\r\nquantity, but sweeter and finer flavored. But the largest bulk of the\r\nvineyards are on comparatively level land, which can be and which is\r\nirrigated. The raisins produced on these low grounds in the moist and\r\ncool valleys are larger, but not of equal flavor and sweetness. In wet\r\nseasons, the hillsides are preferred, the valley lands then being too\r\nwet and cold. Accordingly, as the seasons are wet and cold, or dry and\r\nwarm, the various localities produce raisins of different qualities,\r\nwhich again are valued and paid for differently. The extent of the\r\nvalley or plain lands decides the extent of the raisin districts, and of\r\nlate years the rolling vineyards have decreased in quantity, while those\r\non the plains have increased, until at the present time almost all the\r\nplain lands are occupied with raisin vineyards, especially in the Denia\r\nsub-district.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Climate._--The climate of Denia and its surroundings is rather cold and\r\nwindy; damaging spring frosts, as well as early fall rains, frequently\r\ninterfere with the setting of the grapes and with the harvesting of the\r\ncrop; it has even happened several times that the entire crop has been\r\nseriously injured by one of these, or by both causes combined. Farther\r\nnorth, or in the Valencia district proper, the climate is milder, and\r\nfrost is rare. Oranges are here at home, while the culture of raisin\r\ngrapes becomes less every year. North of Castellon the climatic\r\nconditions are such that no raisin culture is possible.\r\n\r\nAs compared with the climate of Malaga, that of Denia is much less\r\nfavorable to the raisin grape. The production of sun-dried and undipped\r\nraisins in Denia is not possible, and, although it has been attempted\r\nseveral times, it has seldom succeeded. The rainfall of Denia averages\r\ntwelve inches per year. The rainiest months are those of November,\r\nFebruary and April, but the heaviest rainfall at one time occurs quite\r\nfrequently in the first week of September, while light showers are not\r\nuncommon in August, at that time doing much damage to the grapes or the\r\njust exposed raisins.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Irrigation._--Not only is irrigation necessary to grow the vines\r\nsuccessfully and to produce an abundance of grapes, but the irrigation\r\nin the province of Valencia is necessary to the health and longevity of\r\nthe vines. Nowhere else in Spain is the water so abundant, and no saving\r\nof the water is necessary in the majority of the districts. Through an\r\nabundance of water, the soil on the lowlands has now filled up to such\r\nan extent, that in the best vineyards the surface water is only from\r\nfive to eight feet from the surface of the ground. Those vines which\r\ncould not be irrigated have gradually become diseased, and the hillside\r\nvineyards are being rapidly abandoned and devoted to something else.\r\nUpon the abundance and constancy of the water depends the prosperity of\r\nthe whole province, and there is hardly a more prosperous country in\r\nSpain. To show the close connection between irrigation and raisin\r\nproduction in Spain, it will no doubt interest many to know something of\r\nthe irrigation system and the irrigation districts of the province of\r\nValencia, than which no more important ones are found in Spain.\r\n\r\nThe district of Alicante is supplied with water from the river Monegre,\r\nand the Elche district from the river Minalapo. In the northern part of\r\nthe province is the Murviado irrigation district, taking its water from\r\nthe river Palencia. The Jucar irrigation district, situated immediately\r\nsouth of the _huerta_ of Valencia, takes its water from the Jucar\r\nriver, distributing 850 cubic feet of water per second upon some 50,000\r\nacres of land.\r\n\r\nThe Valencia irrigation district consists of 26,350 acres of land close\r\nto the town of Valencia, and is watered by the river Guadalaviar, or, as\r\nit is generally called, the Turia. The water is distributed through\r\neight canals, each carrying from 35 to 120 cubic feet of water per\r\nsecond, the combined low-water discharge of all the canals being from\r\n250 to 350 cubic feet of water per second. Of the importance of\r\nirrigation in this district, we can judge when we learn that the above\r\n26,350 acres contain 72,000 inhabitants and sixty-two villages, or an\r\naverage of 1,774 people per square mile, not including the city of\r\nValencia itself, with a population of 120,000 people. It is also\r\nremarkable that this enormous population on a territory not as large as\r\nthe arable land surrounding any one of our principal inland towns in\r\nCalifornia, is not alone due to the irrigation and care of the land, but\r\nto the minute subdivision of the land, which makes this culture and\r\nirrigation possible. It is a practical illustration of the value of the\r\ncolony system as inaugurated in California, showing what we can expect\r\nof our inland plains when they become fully irrigated and the land\r\nproperly subdivided.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Quality of the Raisins._--It has already been stated that the grapes\r\ngrown in Denia are the Muscat of Alexandria, which were introduced there\r\nby the Moors. Farther south, in the Alicante district, other varieties\r\nare more common, but play no important part in the raisin production of\r\nthe district. The Valencia raisins are inferior to those of Malaga, the\r\nwant of heat requiring them to be dipped in lye before drying. This,\r\nagain, gives these raisins a peculiar reddish, semi-transparent color,\r\nwhich unfits them for table raisins. The Valencia raisins are\r\nprincipally used for cooking; even the best grades of Valencias are\r\ninferior to the inferior grades of Malaga raisins. During the last\r\nseason (1889) large quantities of Denia grapes were cured on the Malaga\r\nstyle, and with great success. Large quantities of such sun-dried Denias\r\nwere sent in bulk to Malaga, and there repacked for export to the United\r\nStates, the Malaga crop having so diminished that the usual demand could\r\nnot be supplied. Years in which such sun-drying is possible in Denia are\r\nrare.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Planting and Care._--The Muscat cuttings are planted generally in\r\nFebruary. The best cuttings are considered to be those taken from vines\r\nat least six years old. The cuttings are set at various distances\r\naccording to the richness of the soil. The richer the soil the less room\r\nis given the vines. Thus the vines are set either five by eleven feet or\r\nfive by twelve feet, or, in other words, they are set in rows eleven or\r\ntwelve feet apart, with the vines five feet apart in the row. The depth\r\nof the cutting is regulated by the moisture of the surface soil, but\r\naverages eighteen inches. The vines begin to bud in the middle of March,\r\nand are from the start subject to great care and constant cultivation.\r\nThe first operation after the cutting is planted is to cut off the top\r\nbud as soon as the vine starts to grow, leaving the two shoots only from\r\nthe two lower buds. No more shoots are allowed to grow the first year.\r\nNext winter the smaller of these two branches is cut off completely and\r\nthe remaining branch is pruned back to two eyes. In the second year the\r\nyoung shoots from the vine are allowed to grow to ten inches or so long,\r\nwhen all are cut away except two of the strongest. Next winter again\r\nthese are pruned so to leave only two eyes on each, or four buds on the\r\nwhole vine. In the succeeding years the branches are gradually increased\r\nin number, but always pruned back to two eyes. After the vine is five\r\nyears old, it is seldom increased as to branches; it is then always\r\npruned back to the same number of spurs. It can be said that the Denia\r\ngrowers pay less attention to the quality of the raisins, and prune more\r\nto attain quantity. They leave more spurs on their vines than do those\r\nin Malaga, and in this respect resemble many of our own California\r\ngrowers, who frequently leave from twelve to fifteen spurs on a vine.\r\nThe vines in Denia are also raised higher above the ground than in\r\nMalaga, very much as we have been in the habit of pruning our own vines.\r\nAt the age of three years the vines come into bearing; but no fine\r\nraisins are made until the vines are five or six years old.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dipping and Scalding._--The dipping process is one of the greatest\r\nimportance, and gives the peculiar characteristics to the Valencia or\r\nDenia raisins. As a similar process will sometime or other be more\r\ngenerally used in California, a more detailed description may prove\r\ninteresting to California growers. We can probably not do better than to\r\nimitate them, although in mechanical appliances we will readily improve\r\nupon their methods. The dipping is always done at the drying ground or\r\n_secadero_. The larger part of the dipping apparatus, or the kettles,\r\nare placed under the ground so as to save heat and fuel. A trench eight\r\nor nine feet in length is dug to the depth of three or four feet. At one\r\nend is built a chimney protruding three or four feet above the level of\r\nthe ground. In the other end of the trench is built a brick wall with an\r\nopening for feeding the fire. Some trenches are lined inside with\r\nbricks, making them more permanent and solid. On the top of this flue,\r\nand on a level with the ground, are built the kettles or boilers,\r\ncontaining not less than twenty gallons each. The boiler nearest the\r\nfire entrance is destined to contain a solution of lye or ashes, the one\r\nnext to the chimney being for boiling water only.\r\n\r\nThe lye is made from the ashes of burnt vine cuttings, together with\r\nlime and sometimes some salt, by men who have acquired the art from\r\nyears of experience, and who know by the appearance of the scalded\r\ngrapes whether the solution is too strong or too weak. If too weak, the\r\nskins of the grapes will be insufficiently cut, which will delay the\r\ndrying of the grapes, and cause them to rot if the weather is damp and\r\nfoggy. If, again, the lye solution is too strong, the skin will be\r\ndestroyed and the berries seriously injured.\r\n\r\nThe grapes to be dipped should be perfectly ripe. If dipped before, they\r\nwill become inferior both as to color and taste. The perfect ripeness is\r\na most important point. The grapes are picked in baskets of about ten\r\npounds each, and carried to the scalder. The man nearest him on the\r\nright fills a perforated ladle with about twenty pounds of the grapes.\r\nThe ladle is made either of wire netting or of tin or zinc, with large\r\nperforated holes about three-eighths of an inch wide. There is a scalder\r\nat each boiler. The first scalder dips the grapes in the scalding water\r\nfor a second, and immediately hands them to the second scalder, who dips\r\nthe same ladle in the boiling lye solution for not over two seconds. The\r\ngrapes are then carefully turned out on trays to dry.\r\n\r\nThe dipping first in scalding water is of the greatest importance, both\r\nin washing off the dust of the grapes and in preparing them to receive\r\nthe alkali wash with more effect. Since the hot-water process was\r\nintroduced, the Valencia raisins have materially improved in quality.\r\nThe grapes are never rinsed in cold water after being dipped, and it is\r\nmore than likely that the lye prevents molding, as, according to A. B.\r\nButler, dipped raisins are sometimes exposed to the rain for three weeks\r\nwithout being totally ruined. In California, our dipped and washed\r\nraisins spoil quickly if exposed to rain. The object of dipping is, of\r\ncourse, to slightly crack the skins so as to allow the water to readily\r\nevaporate. Dipped raisins dry sometimes in five days, while undipped\r\nraisins would require as many weeks. Efforts to produce sun-dried\r\nraisins without dipping them have repeatedly been made in Denia; but\r\nthey are invariably spoiled by the rain, and lately two firms were\r\nruined in their attempts to dispense with the dipping process.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Drying and Curing._--After the grapes have been properly dipped, the\r\ndrying proceeds very quickly. The grapes are immediately spread on cane\r\ntrays or _cañezos_, about six feet long by three or four feet wide.\r\nThese cane trays are made of the common Italian reed or _Arundo donax_,\r\nwhich grows everywhere, even in California, and is here incorrectly\r\nknown as bamboo. The trays are made either of split or of entire canes\r\ntied strongly together. These trays are placed flat on the ground, only\r\nleaving enough space around each one to allow the workmen free access to\r\nthe tray on all sides. After having been exposed to the sun for three\r\ndays, the grapes are turned, in order to dry evenly on both sides. On\r\nthe fifth day, the raisins are turned again, and, if the weather has\r\nbeen favorable, many of the raisins are then ready to pack. A day or two\r\nafter this, all the raisins are ready, and are collected and housed. If,\r\nagain, the weather has been unfavorable, the drying is very much\r\ndelayed. At the approach of rain, the mats or trays are taken up and\r\npiled on the top of each other, under sheds previously made. Every\r\ndrying ground has stationary appliances for this purpose. These simply\r\nconsist of poles stuck in the ground, and extending five or six feet\r\nabove the same. Other cross-rafters or scantlings are nailed between the\r\npoles, thus forming rows of roofless sheds eight or nine feet wide, of\r\ngreater or shorter length. Painted canvas, or simply mats or empty reed\r\ntrays, are used as covers, under which the raisin trays are piled. Under\r\nand between each tray are placed five little cubes of wood, for the\r\npurpose of lifting the tray and preventing it from pressing too heavily\r\non the grapes underneath.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Packing and Disposing of the Crop._--When at last the raisins are\r\ndried, they are either stored by the producer, or, as is more generally\r\nthe case, are taken to the merchant or packer who has supplied the\r\ngrower’s wants during the year in anticipation of the coming crop. There\r\nare thus a number of special packers in Denia, who own large and\r\nsplendid packing-houses in which the crop is yearly handled. The grower\r\nnever packs himself, the enhanced value of the raisins not being\r\nsufficient to warrant the trouble. One of the best and by far the\r\nlargest packing-houses in Denia is owned by J. D. Arquimbau. A more\r\nperfectly equipped establishment is not found anywhere else.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Views from Col. Wm. Forsyth’s Raisin Vineyard, Near\r\nFresno: Residence, Lake, Raisin Dryer, Packing House.]\r\n\r\nAll of the packing is done by women, while the men do the carting of the\r\nraisins from the vineyards to the packing-houses. During the balance of\r\nthe year, when there is no more work in the packing-houses, these very\r\nmen occupy themselves with the sardine fishery, while their wives then\r\ndress the sardines and pack them in oil. They have thus work all the\r\nyear round,--an absolute necessity in a country where the wages are so\r\nsmall, and where the poor man has no chance to save up a capital. The\r\nwages paid for packing in Denia is only fifteen cents per day; while in\r\nMalaga the same work commands from forty to sixty cents per day. In some\r\nof the warehouses in Denia, from two to three hundred women are\r\nemployed, as well as a number of men. The boxes now used are halves of\r\ntwenty-eight pounds, or quarters of fourteen pounds each. The large or\r\nwhole boxes of fifty-six pounds each are no longer in use. The raisins\r\nare all packed “off-stalk,” or, as we say, “loose.” Bunch or stem\r\nraisins, or “on-stalk” raisins, are seldom seen. This great improvement\r\nin packing is of recent origin, and is due entirely to the influence of\r\nEnglish merchants. Some thirty years ago, the raisin industry of\r\nValencia had so deteriorated, that it threatened to entirely cease. The\r\ncause of the deterioration was principally the habit of the buyers to\r\npay for crops, not according to the quality of the raisins, but\r\naccording to the quantity. The small farmer with a few hundred pounds of\r\nraisins carefully cured was paid less, or at least not any more, than\r\nthe man who had hundreds of tons carelessly cured. As a consequence, it\r\nwas to no one’s interest to take any particular pains in curing. The\r\nraisins deteriorated; no care was paid to packing; anything, almost,\r\nstalks, dirt and bruised berries were dumped in boxes together; brands,\r\ntrade-marks and labels were unknown. The whole business was apparently\r\ngoing to ruin. The orders from England became less and less every year.\r\nThose from America almost ceased. The “equality price” or “average\r\nprice,” which has been so much in vogue in California, actually ruined\r\nthe Valencia raisin industry. We ought to take a lesson from them, and\r\nchange this system in time, or we will be in the same bad fix as they\r\nwere.\r\n\r\nThe improvement in Valencia raisins was entirely due to the energetic\r\nefforts of English gentlemen. Mr. George Graham, agent for an English\r\nfirm, established himself in Valencia, investigated the raisin business,\r\nand, seeing the true cause of the ruin, set himself to work to remedy\r\nthe same. He introduced better methods in growing, curing and packing;\r\nand through his efforts a better price was paid for a better grade of\r\nraisins, and it was not long before the raisin business was on an\r\nentirely different footing. The object of the grower was from that on,\r\nnot only to increase the quantity, but to increase the quality as well.\r\nTo begin with, the raisins were shipped off-stalk or loose; but the\r\nboxes were not faced. Now the raisin boxes are all faced, and the\r\nraisins are carefully selected and assorted. As a consequence, the Denia\r\ntrade has of late years increased enormously, until at present all the\r\nland available has been planted to raisins. There is at present but\r\nlittle or no first-class raisin land left in Denia, and it looks as if\r\nthe raisin production there could not be further expanded.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Export and Production._--Although the raisin industry had long existed\r\nin the province of Valencia, it was only in late years that it assumed\r\nan importance. They were already known as _Duracinae_ by the Romans.\r\nRe-introduced or improved by the Arabs or Moors, it soon became a\r\nprominent industry, and the export of raisins to England was already of\r\nsome consequence in the time of William and Mary. In the year 1638,\r\nLewis Roberts, in his merchant map of commerce, informs us that Denia\r\nraisins cost eighteen rials or three shillings per hundred weight. In\r\n1664, Gandia raisins were quite famous, and were known as Pasas. At the\r\nend of the last century, the raisins from Denia and Liria reached forty\r\nthousand quintals, or two thousand tons, distributed as follows: Spain,\r\nsix thousand; France, six thousand; England, twenty-eight\r\nthousand,--equal to one million, four hundred and thirty thousand boxes,\r\nforty thousand quintals, or two thousand tons. In 1862, the raisin\r\nexport from Valencia had dwindled down to seven thousand tons. In 1876,\r\nit had again risen to nineteen thousand tons, and in 1883 to forty\r\nthousand tons. Of these, nine hundred and seventy-nine thousand boxes\r\nwere exported to the United States, one million, three hundred and\r\neighty-five thousand were sent to England, and four hundred and\r\nthirty-six thousand found their way to other parts of Europe and Spain.\r\nIn 1888, the yield was two million, three hundred and sixteen thousand\r\nboxes of twenty-eight pounds each, equal to thirty-two thousand, four\r\nhundred and twenty-four tons. If packed in twenty-pound boxes, this crop\r\nwould have equaled three million, two hundred and forty thousand, four\r\nhundred boxes, or four times as much as California produced at the same\r\ntime. The crop of 1889 is calculated to have reached two million, eight\r\nhundred thousand boxes of twenty-eight pounds each.\r\n\r\nWhen we remember that this class of raisins is as yet hardly produced in\r\nCalifornia, and that the nine hundred and seventy-nine thousand boxes or\r\nmore imported could and should be supplied by us, it would seem that our\r\nfears of overproduction will not immediately be realized. The tendency\r\nof the raisin market is now to supplant these Valencia dipped raisins\r\nwith California undipped or sun-dried raisins, the California Sultanas\r\nbeing considered superior for the same purpose that Valencias were\r\nformerly used.\r\n\r\n\r\nCORINTH AND CURRANTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Historical and Geographical Notes._--The principal and only raisins of\r\nany great commercial importance which are produced by Greece are the\r\ncurrants. We have already spoken of their name, and its supposed origin\r\nfrom the town of Corinth, and of their having been mentioned by Pliny in\r\nthe year 75 A. D. The currants must thus very early have been of\r\nconsiderable importance as a commercial product, although the great\r\nincrease in their production is of more recent date. The crusades which\r\nbrought the nations of the North in contact with the Orient and the\r\nSouth also spread the knowledge of the Grecian currants to the distant\r\nparts of Europe. After the Latin conquest, currants became a commercial\r\narticle, and we have every reason to suppose that, as early as the\r\nbeginning of the thirteenth century, currants had reached the English\r\nshores, and that in the middle of the fourteenth century the English\r\ntrade was fully established. Raysins of Corauntz were quoted in 1374 at\r\ntwo pence and three farthings per pound, equivalent to one dollar and\r\ntwenty-five cents in our money at its present value. In 1513, the first\r\nEnglish consul was appointed at Chios, and from that time on a direct\r\ntraffic was maintained between the Grecian Islands and the North of\r\nEurope. In 1582, Hakluyt writes that efforts had been made to introduce\r\nthe coren plant or vine into England, but that the same failed to fruit.\r\nThe first introduction of the Zante vine into England is supposed by\r\nAnderson to have taken place in 1533. In the end of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, the currant traders were in full intercourse with the Venetians\r\non the Island of Zante, and the Turks on the mainland or Morea. In 1581,\r\nthe Levant Company received a monopoly in the trade of the small fruits\r\ncalled currants, being the raysins of Corinth. According to Wheler, who\r\ntraveled in the Ionian Islands in 1675, Zante produced enough currants\r\nto charge five or six vessels, Cephalonia three or four, and Nathaligo,\r\nMissolonghi and Patros one each. Some few were also brought down from\r\nthe Gulf of Lepanto.\r\n\r\nAs to the native home of the currants, opinions have considerably\r\ndiffered. Some have supposed Zante or Naxos to have been the original\r\nhome of this grape; while others, with better reasons, have held that\r\ntheir original home was Corinth. Beaujour, who was French consul in\r\nGreece in 1790, says: “The fruit is not indigenous to Morea. No writer\r\nbefore the sixteenth century mentions it, and the result of my inquiries\r\nis that the currant came from Naxos into the Morea about 1580. It is\r\ntrue no such plant now exists in Naxos, but it has similarly disappeared\r\nfrom the territory of Corinth, though it is very certain it was\r\ncultivated there in former days, when the Venetians held the country.”\r\nThis account does not agree with the statements of Comte Grasset St.\r\nSauveur, consul to the Ionian Islands from France in 1781. He states, in\r\nhis History of the Ionian Islands, that “the first plants were imported\r\nfrom Corinth to Zante about two centuries ago” (or about 1580). There\r\nare no exact records of the time or of the introducer; but the date is\r\nfixed by the regulations of the Senate of Venice relating to custom\r\nduties. It is likely this introduction took place not much before 1553,\r\nand was caused by the hostility of the Turks, who then held Morea, to\r\nthe merchant vessels of the other nations of Europe, who in fact forbade\r\nthem any entrance to the Gulf of Corinth, the principal export place for\r\nthe currants. Thus John Locke, who in 1553 describes Zante, speaks of\r\nother products of the island, but not of currants.\r\n\r\nHakluyt states that, in 1586, the chief commodities of the island were\r\n“oyle and currants.” The latter, then, must have been introduced some\r\ntime in the middle of the sixteenth century. Lithgow, a Scotch traveler\r\nwho in 1609 visited the islands and published an account of the same in\r\n1633, informs us that, besides oyle and wine, Zante produced one hundred\r\nand sixty thousand chickens of currants, each chicken of gold being\r\nequal to nine shillings of English money. And he adds that the custom\r\nduties on those currants amounted to twenty-two thousand piasters (one\r\npiaster is equivalent to six shillings), a sum of money which those\r\nIslanders could not have afforded (they having been, not above sixty\r\nyears ago, but a base, beggarly people, and in an obscure place) if it\r\nwere not that in England there are some who cannot digest bread, etc.,\r\nwithout these currants. This seems to imply that, since the introduction\r\nof the currant culture in the Island of Zante about the year 1550, the\r\nZanteans had suddenly become comparatively wealthy. So suddenly had this\r\nimportant industry spread, that in 1610, according to Sandys, the chief\r\nexport of both Zante and Cephalonia was currants. In 1612, Coryat says\r\nthat “Zante is famous for its wine, oile and currants.” Fynes Moryson,\r\nin his “Itinerary” published in 1617, states that “the English merchant\r\nvessels exported currants from Zante and Cephalonia, and from Petrasso\r\nin the Gulfe of Corinth.” Tavernier says, in 1678, that, “Corinth\r\nexports great quantities of currants. Patras does the same, which is all\r\nthe trade from those two places.” In 1682, Wheler states that “the ports\r\nof Patros, Nathaligo and Missolonghi, all three together having enough\r\nto lade only one good ship every year.” Randolph, in 1689, mentions that\r\ncurrants were first planted on the plains of Corinth, and that the plain\r\nabout Vostizza produced corn, currants and wine. Of Zante, he says that\r\nit produced two thousand tons of currants. Thus it will seem as if,\r\nthrough the fostering care of the Venetians, the currant trade was\r\ntransplanted from the mainland of Morea to the Islands of Zante and\r\nCephalonia, there to become of almost national importance. Until the\r\nTurks were expelled from Morea, the latter never made any serious\r\nefforts to recover the lost trade. First in later times the culture of\r\ncurrants has again spread on the mainland, especially on the northern\r\nshore of the Gulf of Corinth, and to-day the combined production of the\r\nMorean vineyards is largely in excess of that of the Ionian Islands.\r\n\r\nIn our times the currants are exported either from the mainland of\r\nGreece, the Morea, the ancient Peloponnesus, or from the Grecian\r\nIslands,--Cephalonia and Zante. In Morea, the principal ports for the\r\nexportation of the currants are Patras and Vostizza, although other\r\nports export a few. Even the Islands of Ithaca and Santa Maura\r\ncontribute a few. Efforts have been made to extend the culture of the\r\ncurrant vine, and introduce it to other islands, but not with any great\r\ndegree of success. This is entirely attributed to climatic conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Characteristics and Quality._--The currants are small, seedless raisins\r\nproduced from the currant grape, which again is characterized by small\r\nclusters, which, when perfect, are very compact like the heads of Indian\r\ncorn or maize. The skin of the berries is thin, the pulp very sweet,\r\nwith a strong flavor and aroma. The raisins are similarly aromatic and\r\nvery sweet, sometimes semi-transparent, but generally dark violet. The\r\nflavor of the raisins is entirely distinct from the Muscatel, and is\r\nvery superior to that of the also seedless Sultana raisins.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Soil and Irrigation._--The soil best suited to the currant grape is a\r\ncalcareous marl, which must be of good depth, loose, and easily worked.\r\nSuch marls are also prized for their great power of retaining moisture.\r\nBut vineyards are planted in Cephalonia, Zante and Ithaca in the most\r\ndifferent soils and situations. They are found in gray marls, in red\r\nclay, on the plains and among the hills, in fact, in the most widely\r\ndifferent situations. The soil of Zante contains a small percentage of\r\nsulphate of lime or gypsum, which is by many considered indispensable\r\nfor the successful and profitable culture of the currant vine. The\r\ncurrant vine thrives especially in low and rich land which can be\r\nirrigated, and irrigation is quite essential to the perfect development\r\nof the grapes. Many vineyards, however, are not irrigated, the\r\nirrigation, of course, only being practicable on the plains. This\r\nirrigation is practiced from October to the end of December, often while\r\nthe natural rainfall supplies the artificial watering. The lands are\r\ngenerally small freeholdings, owned by the peasants. The most valuable\r\ncurrant vineyards are situated on the rich and level valley lands.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Preparation of the Land for Irrigation._--The preparation of the land\r\nfor a currant vineyard is expensive, as the land is hardly ever level\r\nenough to admit of the vines being immediately planted. The surface is\r\ntherefore first leveled and divided up in smaller cheeks or flats, each\r\none surrounded by a bank. The whole is covered with a network of\r\nditches, which are necessary for the perfect irrigation of the soil.\r\nWhere there is water enough, the vineyards are irrigated in November and\r\nDecember, and are then flooded as often as practicable, the water\r\nsometimes standing on the ground for weeks in succession. In perfectly\r\narranged vineyards, the irrigation is so managed that the water flows\r\nfrom one check to another, and is first shut off at the advent of the\r\nNew Year, when the pruning and cultivation begins. By this plentiful\r\nirrigation, the ground becomes thoroughly soaked, and remains saturated\r\nuntil the next season, when rain again sets in and fills the irrigation\r\ncanals. No summer irrigation is used in old vineyards, and in young\r\nvineyards only in case of great necessity.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Distances of the Currant Vines._--The vines are set at various\r\ndistances, in some places four feet each way, in others again six by\r\nten, giving a various number of from 740 to 2,622 to the acre. In some\r\nplaces, the old practice of planting the vines in groups of four still\r\nexists. Each group consists of four vines one and a half feet apart, and\r\neach group distant six feet from each other either way. Of late,\r\nhowever, the vines are planted farther apart, probably because the soil\r\nis becoming exhausted, a favorite way being to have the vines closer one\r\nway than the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Care of Cuttings, Planting and Grafting._--Great importance is attached\r\nto procuring cuttings from a distance, or in getting new strains.\r\nCuttings from the nearest vineyard are never used, as they are\r\nconsidered to produce inferior vines, and not do as well. To procure\r\ncuttings or vines, the old vines are sometimes cut a few inches below\r\nthe surface of the soil, causing the parent plant to throw off numerous\r\nsuckers or shoots, which the following winter are separated and used as\r\nwe do rooted vines here in California. Three or four years will elapse\r\nbefore they come into regular bearing. Some vineyards are produced by\r\ngrafting the black currant on the wine grape, and many wine vineyards\r\nthat do not pay are thus transformed into paying raisin vineyards. The\r\ngrafted vines come into bearing much sooner than those grown from\r\ncuttings. The grafting is performed in Zante as follows: The soil is dug\r\naway from the main trunk of the old vine to the depth of from twelve to\r\neighteen inches, and the trunk cut off square at the bottom of the pit.\r\nTwo or three scions are then inserted in the trunk, and made to slightly\r\nproject above the ground, in no case with more than two or three eyes.\r\nClay is then applied to the joint of the graft, and the trunk slightly\r\ncovered with leaves, and the hole then filled up with soil. The grafting\r\nis done in the spring, and the cuttings must be kept dormant in dark and\r\ncool cellars.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pruning the Vines._--The pruning is done in the fall, just as soon as\r\nthe leaves have fallen, and is performed in two parts. In December, the\r\nvines are cleaned of all small, weakly or dead branches, and at that\r\ntime only the large and strong branches are left. In February, the\r\nregular cutting back commences, two or three eyes being left on every\r\nspur. There are as many different ideas of pruning the vines in Greece\r\nas there are in California, each one having his favorite methods and\r\ntheories as to what is proper and what is not. Some vineyardists prefer\r\nto delay the second pruning until after the vines have started to bud\r\nout, and, when the young shoots are two weeks old, the old wood is so\r\ncut that the bleeding of the vine will not run down on the bud. Bleeding\r\nis at any time considered injurious. The principal pruning is therefore\r\nconducted in February, as being the time most suitable to the currant\r\ngrape and conducive to the best crops. Mr. Manoti, a very intelligent\r\nZanteote currant grower, told Dr. Davy (_Ionian Islands_, page 343) that\r\nhe had at one time experimented with pruning the currant vine at\r\ndifferent times of the year. Those pruned in December yielded very few\r\ngrapes, which were large; those pruned in April gave plenty, but very\r\nsmall berries. Again, those pruned in February were in every way the\r\nbest. Mr. Manoti added that if he had told one of his neighbors of his\r\nexperiments they would have laughed at him, and said, “Whoever thinks of\r\npruning the uva passa (or currant) in December or April.” This shows how\r\nmuch the growers are opposed to experimenting and improving upon the\r\nmethods which have been handed down to them from their forefathers. As\r\nwe have shown, the currant vines are all very closely pruned, very much\r\nin the same way as our Muscats. Seldom more than three spurs are allowed\r\nto remain, each one with two or three eyes. Summer pruning or topping\r\nthe branches is never practiced on the currant vines, but generally on\r\nthe wine grapes. On the contrary the currant branches are carefully\r\nguarded, and in order that they may not break are tied to stakes from\r\nfour to five feet high.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Care of the Vineyard._--After irrigation is over, the vineyards are dug\r\nover. The soil is dug up around the vines and placed on top of the\r\nground in small heaps, which process is considered beneficial both to\r\nthe roots of the vines and to the soil. In April, this soil is all put\r\nback, and the ground leveled. Each vine is staked. By the middle of\r\nApril, the vines are in leaf. By the middle of July, the first fruit is\r\nripe, and by the middle of August the harvest has everywhere begun. The\r\nstakes for the vines are imported at a cost of $15 or $16 per thousand,\r\nand constitute the most expensive item in the construction of a currant\r\nvineyard.\r\n\r\nThe mildew or oidium, which some fifty years ago spread all over the\r\nworld, destroyed many of the vineyards before the sulphuring was\r\ndiscovered as a sure remedy. Sulphuring the vines is now regularly\r\npracticed in all the vineyards; but there is a popular belief that the\r\nraisins are no longer of the same fine and pure flavor as they used to\r\nbe before the advent of the oidium and the sulphur.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ringing the Branches._--A process much used in the currant vineyards is\r\nthe ringing of the branches. At the time of blossoming, some of the main\r\nbranches are cut in such a way that a small ring of bark is separated\r\nfrom the branch near its base. The sap which ascends in the interior of\r\nthe branch, but which returns by the bark, is thus prevented from\r\nreturning, and must remain in the branch. The effect is that a large\r\nnumber of clusters are formed with berries both larger and sweeter than\r\nthose not thus treated. But the practice is not without its drawbacks.\r\nIn the dry lands of Cephalonia, where it was first introduced, it was\r\nsoon discovered that the ringed vines began to fail after two or three\r\nyears, and the method had to be modified or abandoned. In Morea, where\r\nthe soil is moister and richer, the ringing did not prove as dangerous,\r\nand is yet practiced, though great care is taken that the same branch is\r\nnever girdled or ringed in two successive years. Only the strongest\r\nvines are able to resist the exhausting effects of the process; the\r\nweaker ones should never be forced to overproduce.\r\n\r\nThe exhalations of fig-trees and pomegranate bushes are considered most\r\nbeneficial to the currant grape, and the former are found everywhere\r\namong the plantations, especially along roads and ditches.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Drying and Curing._--The drying and curing of the currant grapes are\r\ndone on drying grounds. These are simply leveled places covered with\r\nfresh cow dung, or cow dung first mixed with water into a paste. When\r\nthis paste is dried, it presents a smooth surface, firm but elastic, and\r\nentirely free from smell. This kind of drying ground is considered the\r\nbest kind. Inferior drying grounds are simply made of the cleared soil.\r\nThe currants dried on the latter are always full of sand and dirt to an\r\nalarming extent, and bring an inferior price in the market. The bunches\r\nare turned several times until dry, when they are raked over with a\r\nwooden rake or broom, by which process the stalks are separated from the\r\nberries. The berries are now gathered, and the better qualities are\r\nwinnowed in machines like our fanning-mills. The next step is to sweat\r\nthe currants, which is simply done by piling them in air-tight rooms.\r\nThe currants are here put in large piles, which by sweating and pressure\r\nbecome so hard and solid that, when removing the berries, a sharp spade\r\nis used for digging. The vintage begins in July in Zante; Cephalonia\r\ngrapes ripen almost one week earlier.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cost of Currant Vineyards in Greece._--In the Grecian Islands and\r\nMorea, the best vineyard land varies between $80 and $125 per acre for\r\nunimproved land. To prepare the land for the vineyard and irrigation, it\r\nwill cost, in extreme cases, from $20 to $50 more. The first year’s\r\ncultivation and care of the young vines is, of course, different\r\naccording to locality, but the average is seldom less than $50 per acre.\r\nThe value of already planted property or a vineyard in good bearing is\r\nseldom less than $320 per acre, and often as high as $650 per\r\nacre,--four stremmas. Strange enough, in calculating the cost of a\r\nvineyard in Greece, no one ever takes into consideration the price of\r\nthe plantation or the capital invested. The interest on the same is\r\nnever considered by the natives. In this respect they resemble our own\r\nfarmers, who, in calculating the expenses of their farms, never take\r\ninto consideration the labor of themselves and family. Of course, it is\r\nalmost impossible to obtain exact calculations of profit. The following\r\nwill serve as a sample: An acre of vineyard planted to currants yields\r\n3,200 pounds. The price obtained for the same is two cents per pound, or\r\n$64. The labor for the year on one acre is estimated at $45, leaving a\r\nyearly profit of $19 per acre. In reality, however, this is not a true\r\nstatement, as it does not consider the interest on the capital. If the\r\nsame should be added, it is evident that there would be but little or no\r\nprofit in the growing of currants. The industry simply enables the\r\npeasant who pursues the work to live and support his family, and\r\npossibly to pay his taxes. Only the very best land and the best\r\nvineyards can pay enough to enable its owner to save up a capital,\r\ngenerally a difficult thing in Greece for any one but a merchant or\r\ngovernment officer.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, the cost of producing one hundred pounds of currant raisins\r\nis not less than $1.35. Whatever the merchant pays above this to the\r\nproducer will be for the benefit of the producer. But, as a rule, this\r\nway of buying direct is not in use. The merchant sells on commission,\r\nand what this means we who have had experience in the raisin business in\r\nthis State all know. We will see how a calculation of an acre of\r\ncurrants will look, when all the expenses are taken into consideration:\r\n\r\n  One acre of currants equals 3,200 pounds at three cents per\r\n  pound                                                        $96.00\r\n                                                               ------\r\n  Expense on 3,200 pounds at $1.35                     $43.00\r\n  Packing and hauling                                    7.50\r\n  Freight, insurance, duty, etc.                        22.50\r\n  Interest on capital invested                          15.00\r\n  Merchant charges say                                   8.00\r\n                                                       ------\r\n                                                               $96.00\r\n\r\nIn this instance the poor currant raiser has had no other profit than\r\nthe five per cent interest on his capital invested; he has, in other\r\nwords, come out even. But figures, sometimes, are apt to lie. The\r\nprofit, no doubt, is small to the producer, but it must still be some.\r\nHe makes, no doubt, fair wages according to his own ideas, and as he has\r\npaid for his capital in labor, and probably never handled a dollar of\r\nthe same, he considers himself comparatively well-to-do. But, as currant\r\nvineyards sometimes sell, and sell high, too, it is simply unaccountable\r\nthat the interest is never taken into consideration in estimating the\r\nprofits of the grower. The currant industry is, I believe, the only one\r\nin the world in which this is not done. I have thus extensively dwelt\r\nupon the profits and expenses of this industry in its native country, on\r\naccount of the many attempts to introduce the growing of currants here\r\nin California. The question with us is, will it pay. Our advantage is\r\nthat our currants would be protected; but still it is very doubtful if\r\ncurrant plantations would ever pay enough to warrant us to engage in the\r\nsame. The price paid at present is too low, and, as long as Muscatels\r\nbring a higher price, it will probably be the favorite grape with us.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Consumption and Production._--The importation of currants to England\r\nwas, at the end of the last century, about 3,600 tons. In 1832 this had\r\nrisen to 7,135 tons, in 1864 to 37,151 tons, and in 1876 to 48,595 tons.\r\nAs regards the production of currants in Greece, the average yield from\r\n1816 to 1826 was, for Cephalonia, 2,000 tons, for Zante 3,000 tons, and\r\nfor Morea 4,000 tons or over. From that time on the exportations from\r\nZante and Cephalonia increased, while the export of Morea decreased.\r\nThus, in 1833, Zante and Cephalonia exported about 11,000 tons, and\r\nMorea only 2,000 tons, this principally on account of the Greek\r\nrevolution. In 1840, the three places exported 14,206 tons, which again\r\nin 1849 had risen to 30,850 tons, in 1858 to 32,950 tons, in 1868 to\r\n55,283 tons, and in 1876 to 86,104 tons. This large crop was exported as\r\nfollows: England, 60,263 tons; Germany, 1,475 tons; Holland, 4,847 tons;\r\nTrieste, 3,241 tons; America, 11,225 tons; Belgium, 4,105 tons; Various,\r\n948 tons.\r\n\r\nSince that time the production of currants has increased greatly in\r\nGreece, especially on the mainland, and now it reaches yearly from\r\n126,000 to 130,000 tons. During the last four years the production has\r\nbeen about as follows (according to L. C. Crowe in the _California\r\nFruit-grower_): 1884, 130,000 tons; 1885, 114,000 tons; 1886, 126,000\r\ntons; 1887, 127,000 tons.\r\n\r\nIn 1886 this crop was produced in the following places:\r\n\r\n  Gulf of Corinth                                    7,000 tons.\r\n  Vostizza                                          10,000   “\r\n  Patras                                            12,000   “\r\n  Gastuni, Pergos, Olympia                          38,000   “\r\n  Kyparissia, Figliatra, Gargaliano                 17,000   “\r\n  Ligudista, Pylos, Modone and Corone                9,000   “\r\n  Kalamata and Nisi                                 14,000   “\r\n  Missolonghi, Ætolico, Lepanto                      2,500   “\r\n  Nauplia and Argos                                    600   “\r\n                                                   -------\r\n  Total for Morea and Acarnania                    110,000   “\r\n  Ionian Islands, Cephalonia, Ithaca, Santa Maura   10,500   “\r\n  Zante                                              6,000   “\r\n                                                   -------\r\n  Total                                            126,000   “\r\n\r\nOf this crop the United States imported as follows (the freight to New\r\nYork in 1886 ranging from 17s. 6d. to 20s. per ton, gross): 1883, 13,895\r\ntons; 1884, 10,175 tons; 1885, 8,283 tons; 1886, 8,755 tons.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, the consumption of currants has increased largely\r\nduring the last twenty-five years. In 1874, we imported 14,141,797\r\npounds of currants; but in 1888 the importations had increased to\r\n30,636,424 pounds, valued at $1,176,532. The duty is now one cent per\r\npound in this country; while in England it is seven shillings per\r\nhundred pounds.\r\n\r\nThe currants exported to the United States are known as Provincial\r\ncurrants or American staple, and are not considered the best quality;\r\nthey are grown principally in Trifylla and Pylia and are shipped from\r\nthe ports Zante and Patras. Some come also from Vostizza, Catacolo,\r\nKalamata, Nauplia and Cephalonia. The Kalamata currants are inferior and\r\nare mostly exported to France for brandy and wine making. The choicest\r\ncurrants are those grown in Zante, and there known as “Cascalina.” They\r\ngo mostly to England, while the other products of the islands go to\r\nBelgium, Holland and Northern Germany.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Currants in California._--California has so far not cut any figure as a\r\ncurrant-producing country, not because the currants will not grow here,\r\nbut because no one has ever seriously engaged in their culture. Currant\r\ngrapevines are scattered all over the State; but, to our knowledge, no\r\nplantations are larger than an acre or two. In Fresno, a few acres of\r\ncurrants are found in the Mirabelle Vineyard east of town, and a few\r\nhundred vines are also grown on the Raisina Vineyard in the Central\r\nColony. Outside of these we know of only scattered vines. These currants\r\nare all of the white variety, which is considered inferior to the black\r\ncurrant of Zante and the mainland of Greece. When dried, they produce a\r\nmost beautiful semi-transparent raisin, entirely seedless, with a very\r\nthin skin and of very fine flavor. The yield, however, has from some\r\ncause or other not been equal to expectations, and, the price of\r\ncurrants being lower than that of other raisins, the former has not been\r\nconsidered as profitable as the Muscatels. Until we import the true\r\nblack currant from Zante and find the most suitable locality to grow\r\nthem, it is not likely that currant culture will make much headway in\r\nthis country. We have, however, no doubt that, with our various\r\nclimates, many places will be found in California where the currant will\r\nyield enough to pay, provided our raisinmen will be satisfied with a\r\nreasonable profit.\r\n\r\n\r\nSMYRNA RAISINS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Districts in Smyrna: Their Extent and Climate._--The port of Smyrna, so\r\nfamous for its dried figs, is hardly less renowned for the immense\r\nquantity of raisins and dried grapes of different kinds which are\r\nshipped from there to all parts of the world. While Smyrna figs are\r\nbetter known than Smyrna raisins, the latter are by far the most\r\nimportant industry. Thus from 1880 to 1881 the raisin crop exported from\r\nSmyrna was valued at $4,602,388; while the value of the fig crop did not\r\nexceed $1,646,998, or about three million dollars less than the former.\r\nSince that time the raisin trade has yet further increased, until it\r\nto-day reaches one hundred thousand tons of raisins and dried grapes.\r\nUnlike the figs, which are only grown in the interior valleys some\r\nthirty to sixty miles from Smyrna, the grapes which produce the raisins\r\nare grown in the immediate vicinity of the town. The large territory\r\nwhich exports the Smyrna raisins can, however, be divided into several\r\nsub-districts, each one having some characteristics of its own, both as\r\nregards quality of raisins, time of ripening, etc. These districts are:\r\nChesme, Vourla, Yerly and Carabourna. The principal variety of grape\r\ngrown in these districts is the Sultana, a seedless grape with enormous\r\nbunches. Many other varieties are found there also, such as “black” and\r\n“red,” the latter said to be identical with the Spanish Muscat of\r\nAlexandria, which I doubt.\r\n\r\nThe Chesme district is situated to the west on the peninsula near\r\nSmyrna, its principal port for exportation of the crop being the town of\r\nChesme. The Chesme raisins are considered inferior to those of the other\r\ndistricts. Three-fourths of the raisins from the district are exported\r\nto Hamburg, Bremen, Stettin, Amsterdam, and to Trieste in Austria. The\r\nlatter town is the main distributing point for most of the raisins grown\r\nin the eastern Mediterranean raisin districts.\r\n\r\nThe Carabourna or Karabournou district produces the best raisins,--both\r\nof the Sultanas, the red and the black. The district is situated to the\r\neast and north on the same peninsula as Chesme. The district is rough\r\nand hilly, but the whole is cultivated to vines. The Carabourna “Elemês”\r\ngo about one-half to Russia, the balance to England and Trieste.\r\n\r\nThe Vourla district consists of a fertile plain lying on the isthmus\r\nbetween the Bay of Smyrna and Scala Nova or Ephesus. The export place is\r\nthe port of Vourla, one of the finest harbors on the coast of Asia\r\nMinor, and often the meeting place for fleets of the Western nations of\r\nEurope during their remonstrances in Turkish waters.\r\n\r\nThe Yerly district immediately surrounds the town of Smyrna, and extends\r\nfrom Nymphio in the east to Tourbali in the south and Sivri-Hissar in\r\nthe west, thus bordering the Vourla district. Yerly Sultanas are the\r\nearliest in the market, sometimes being ready in the first weeks of\r\nAugust.\r\n\r\nSmall quantities of raisins also come from Tyra, Bairdir, Aidin and\r\nother places in the fig districts in the interior. The Island of Samos,\r\noff the coast of Asia Minor, produces raisins of several kinds, such as\r\nSultanas, black raisins, principally for distilling abroad, and Muscatel\r\nraisins, the latter reaching three thousand tons in favorable seasons.\r\nThe Island of Cos or Stanchio is also famous for its Sultana raisins,\r\nsaid to be the finest of any produced in Turkey.\r\n\r\nThe climate of the Smyrna raisin districts is very mild, allowing farm\r\nlabor to be performed the year round. The temperature seldom falls below\r\nthe freezing point, while from the middle of May to the middle of\r\nSeptember it ranges from 70 to 90 degrees Fahrenheit in the shade.\r\nDuring the summer, the _Imbat_ or seabreeze tempers the heat and makes\r\nthe climate pleasant to live in. The grapes begin to ripen about July\r\nfirst, the Sultana grapes being the earliest. The rainfall is abundant\r\nduring the rainy months of the year, September to April, and averages\r\ntwenty-five inches, varying from fifteen inches in dry seasons to\r\nthirty-three inches in very wet years. The following table of the\r\nrainfall is taken from the consular reports published in 1884:\r\n\r\n_Table showing the monthly rainfall in the city of Smyrna, in inches and\r\nhundredths of inches, during the nineteen years ending with 1882._\r\n\r\nCompiled by W.

The best vineyards are those which are situated inland\r\nfrom seven to twenty miles from the coast. The vineyard districts are\r\nall rough and hilly, except those in the Vourla district, which are on\r\ncomparatively level ground. While some vineyards stretch from the\r\nseashore, others reach an elevation of four hundred feet or over. The\r\nsoil varies with the districts. The best soil for the Sultanas is\r\nconsidered to be hippurite limestone soil, common in some districts.\r\nThis white, marly soil is in places mixed with a yellow-ocher-colored\r\nloam, with sand and gravel. The abundance of the rainfall makes\r\nirrigation unnecessary, and no vines are grown with irrigation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Care of the Vines._--While no general irrigation is needed, the young\r\nvines are watered by hand in years of exceptionally light rainfall. The\r\nvines are generally grown from rooted cuttings, which have been planted\r\nin trenches the year before. Previous to the planting of a vineyard, the\r\nsoil is dug to the depth of three or four feet. If this can be done the\r\nyear before planting, it is considered better, as resulting in a quicker\r\nand stronger growth of the vines.\r\n\r\nIn older vineyards, the vines are set in rows six or seven feet apart,\r\nand with three or four feet between the rows. The vines are not grown to\r\nstandards, but from branching stalks from one to two and a half feet\r\nhigh, with an average height of one and a half feet from the ground. No\r\nstakes are used, and only occasionally is there seen a prop under\r\nheavier loaded branches.\r\n\r\nThe pruning is done in the winter, when the vines are comparatively\r\ndormant. The superfluous branches are then cut away, and the remaining\r\nones are cut to two or three eyes each. The cultivation was, until\r\nlately, performed in the simplest way with pick and spade. The first\r\ndigging is done in January, at which time also the ground is manured.\r\nThis is done by digging pits and trenches in the vineyard, which are\r\nfilled with goat and camel dung. These trenches remain open for a month\r\nor more, and are after that time filled in. The first digging in the\r\nsoil is done in November, the second one in January and February, when,\r\nin leveling the ground, it is at the same time dug over again one foot\r\nor more. The third or last digging is performed in March, when simply\r\nthe weeds are spaded under. Of late years, vineyardists from other\r\nMediterranean districts have settled in Smyrna and brought with them\r\nbetter methods. Greek farmers have especially done much to improve the\r\nold ways of cultivation used by the slovenly or ignorant natives.\r\n\r\nIn May, the young shoots are pinched back after the grapes have set well\r\nand began to develop. The pinching of the ends produces a second crop,\r\nwhich, besides being later, also consists of smaller grapes than the\r\nfirst. All sterile and inferior shoots are then cut off, and this is\r\nrepeated during the summer in order that the vines may not be weakened\r\nunnecessarily. The vines come into bearing in the third year, begin to\r\npay expenses in the fourth year, and leave a profit in the fifth year\r\nafter being set out. In the seventh and eighth years the vines are\r\nconsidered in full bearing.\r\n\r\nThe Sultana grapes begin to ripen in July. The vintage begins towards\r\nthe end of July, and lasts until the middle of August. Other varieties\r\nof grapes are later, lasting from the middle of August to the end of\r\nSeptember, their vintage seldom lasting as late as the first week of\r\nOctober. The first raisins are ready about August 1st, and the last\r\nSultanas are all in by September 1st, the other varieties of raisins\r\ncoming in later.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dipping, Drying and Curing._--The curing of the grapes into raisins\r\nrequires great care, and nowhere is any more skill shown than in Smyrna.\r\nIts raisins are the most beautiful of any, their splendid appearance and\r\ntransparency being due to the process employed. The drying is done on\r\ndrying-floors, which sometimes consist of the bare ground only, at other\r\ntimes of elevated beds of earth a foot or so high. When the soil is not\r\nnaturally hard and suitable for drying-floors, it is first prepared by\r\ncutting off the weeds, and is then watered and packed until a smooth and\r\nhard surface is produced. This hard bed is sometimes left bare, and at\r\nother times covered with matting. In other places the grapes are dried\r\non canvas, or on trays made of the Italian reed, or of grasses. These\r\ntrays are raised on props three or four inches above the ground, and are\r\nloose so that they may be put on top of each other to exclude the sun,\r\nrain or fog, according to locality and season. Great stress is laid upon\r\nhaving the grapes fully ripe. Before thus exposed, the grapes are\r\ndipped in a solution of lye and oil, and upon the skill in this\r\nperformance depends the beauty and value of the raisins. A potash is\r\nmade from the ashes of the vine cuttings of the previous year. About one\r\ngallon of this potash solution is mixed with from twenty to twenty-five\r\ngallons of water, making a weak lye solution of a strength of from five\r\nto six degrees in Beaume’s “Lyeometer.” A similar strength would be\r\nobtained by dissolving one pound of pearl ash in ten gallons of water.\r\nTubs of wood or zinc of the size of two and a half by two feet are used\r\nfor dipping. To every such tub of twenty-five gallons is added from\r\none-fourth to two gallons of olive oil. The latter quantity is used in\r\nthe Karabournou district, where the finest raisins are made. When of\r\nproper strength as regards both oil and lye, the wash runs off from the\r\nbunches smoothly; when, again, the wash runs off in small globules,\r\nthere is a deficiency of either oil or potash. The grapes are loaded in\r\nsmall baskets of twenty-five pounds each, and immersed in the wash for\r\nhalf a minute. They are then taken out and spread either on the ground\r\nor on trays or canvas. In the interior, where the sun is hot, the reed\r\nmats are placed on top of each other to exclude the sun. The same is\r\nalso done if rain or fog is feared. After a few days of exposure, and\r\nwhen partially dried, the raisins are sprinkled every morning with the\r\nsame lye solution, but without oil. The Sultanas are dried in from five\r\nto eight days. This dipping process is also used for the larger\r\nMuscatels, but the lye is made stronger, probably reaching the\r\nproportion of about one and a half pounds of pearl ash to five gallons\r\nof water. The carefully dipped raisins have a pure greenish amber color,\r\nand a peculiar flavor. They are worth twenty per cent more than undipped\r\nfruit.\r\n\r\nThe Sultanas of the better grades are now sold off-stalk or loose. The\r\nfinest brands are the Chesme elemê, or Chesme select. Elemê means choice\r\nor select, and is used both for raisins and figs. The yield of an acre\r\nof Sultana vines varies in different vineyards, according to the quality\r\nof the soil. A good yield is considered about seven tons of fresh\r\ngrapes, or about two and a third tons of raisins.\r\n\r\nThe price of the Smyrna Sultanas fluctuates considerably; but it may be\r\nsaid that the best grades are always from twenty-five to thirty per cent\r\nhigher than the dipped raisins of Valencia. Thus, in 1843, dipped\r\nValencias brought six and a quarter cents, while the Smyrna Sultanas\r\nbrought ten cents. In 1844, the Valencias were quoted at ten cents,\r\nwhile the Sultanas brought twenty cents per pound. Of late years, the\r\nSmyrna Sultanas have fluctuated between four and a half and twelve and a\r\nhalf cents per pound.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Production and Export._--The production of Smyrna raisins and dried\r\ngrapes has enormously increased during the last few years. In 1844, the\r\naverage crop was only from six to eight thousand tons. In 1868, this had\r\nincreased to nineteen thousand tons, and in 1871 we find the export from\r\nSmyrna to be forty-eight thousand tons. In 1881, this had grown to\r\nseventy-five thousand tons (according to the consular report of\r\nConsul-General G. H. Heap of Constantinople). Of the districts already\r\nmentioned, Chesme and Vourla produce about three times as much as Yerly\r\nand Carabourna. A somewhat varied estimate of the Smyrna raisin crop is\r\ngiven by Consul W. E. Stevens of Smyrna, in his report dated February\r\n28, 1884. According to him, the raisin crop of Smyrna should amount to\r\none million, nine hundred thousand hundred weight or ninety-five\r\nthousand tons. These two consular estimates would give Smyrna as\r\nfollows: 1871, forty-eight thousand tons; 1872, thirty-one thousand\r\ntons; 1879, seventy-five thousand tons; 1881, forty-nine thousand tons;\r\n1884, ninety-five thousand tons. This, of course, includes all kinds of\r\nraisins. As regards the Sultana raisins, the reports of the two consuls\r\nalso differ. By Consul Stevens, it is estimated to be thirty-two\r\nthousand, five hundred tons, or sixty-five million pounds; while Consul\r\nHeap puts the figures at only nineteen million, four hundred thousand\r\npounds, or only nine thousand, seven hundred tons. We have no means to\r\nverify the statements, but are inclined to think the higher figure the\r\nmore correct. If it is true that the raisin yield of Smyrna to-day\r\nreaches one hundred thousand tons, it would be absurd to think that only\r\nten per cent should be Sultanas, which is the principal raisin grape of\r\nthe district. It is more probable that at least one-third of the whole\r\ncrop consists of Sultanas. About eighty per cent of all the Sultana\r\nraisins go to England, ten per cent are consumed by Eastern Europe and\r\nRussia, a small part only going to the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cost of Vineyards in Smyrna._--The cost of vineyards in the Smyrna\r\ndistrict varies just as it does elsewhere. Bearing vineyards change\r\nhands at from three hundred to four hundred and fifty dollars per acre.\r\nThe yearly labor on an acre of vines, including pruning, cultivation and\r\ndrying, amounts to fifty dollars an acre or more. The average yield per\r\nacre averages from about eighty-five to ninety dollars, leaving a profit\r\nof from thirty to forty dollars, equal to from about eight to ten per\r\ncent on the capital invested. I believe, however, that these figures may\r\nbe modified, and that the profit on an acre of average vineyard often\r\nreaches from fifty to sixty dollars. The fact that an acre of vineyard\r\nsells for four hundred and fifty dollars indicates that it must not only\r\ngive a fair but a good interest on that sum. The raisins from one acre\r\nof a Smyrna vineyard are sold for $88. The interest on the par value of\r\nan acre ($450) for one year at five per cent is $22.50. The other\r\nexpenses during the year amount to $50, leaving, as net profit, $6.50.\r\nThe above is a low estimate copied from English statements.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Other Varieties of Raisins._--Besides Sultanas, Smyrna produces an\r\nenormous quantity of raisins of other kinds. The demand for these has\r\nbeen and is constantly increasing, the most being shipped to\r\nmanufacturers of wines, distilled liquors of all kinds, jellies, jams,\r\netc. These varieties are known as Large Black and Large Red. These\r\nvarieties are grown in all the Smyrna districts, and in quantity far\r\nexceed the Sultanas. The following will give an idea of how this trade\r\nhas increased of late. Red and Black Smyrna raisins in tons: 1868,\r\n12,795; 1876, 15,500; 1881, 40,000; 1883, 45,000; 1888, 60,000. The\r\nprice varies from three to four cents per pound in the local market.\r\nJudging from the constantly increased export of these kinds of raisins,\r\nit is not likely that the production of the same is likely to soon be\r\noverdone.\r\n\r\n\r\nITALY AND ITALIAN RAISINS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lipari and Belvidere._--Of the Mediterranean countries, Italy produces\r\nthe smallest quantity of raisins. We cannot imagine this to be on\r\naccount of unsuitable soil and climate, but more on account of the\r\ntardiness of its people to take kindly to new industries and improve\r\nupon their older methods. In former years the raisins from Southern\r\nItaly were much exported to Northern Europe; to-day the trade is\r\ninsignificant. In the sixteenth century, the raisins from Lipari and\r\nBelvidere were of considerable repute, but were, however, considered\r\ninferior to the Spanish raisins. The Island of Lipari, to-day\r\nprincipally known on account of its volcanoes, produces yet so-called\r\nLipari currants of larger size than those from Morea. They are of much\r\ninferior quality, being hard and dry and of oblong shape.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pantellaria._--The Island of Pantellaria, between Sicily and Africa,\r\nalso produces raisins of somewhat better quality, which, if better\r\npacked, would favorably compare with the Lexias of Valencia and Denia.\r\nThe Pantellarias, or Belvideres, as they are known in the market, are\r\nprincipally consumed in Northern Italy and Southern France. They are\r\nsweet and good raisins, which, if carefully and intelligently handled,\r\nwould rapidly improve in quality.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Calabria._--Since the destruction of the Calabrian raisins through the\r\nmildew, the raisin production of this peninsula has largely increased.\r\nIn 1876, it had reached eight thousand tons, but must now probably be\r\ndouble that amount. The Calabrian raisins produced on the mainland of\r\nItaly are of good quality, and are principally exported to France.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHILE AND HUASCO RAISINS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Characteristics._--The Chile or Huasco raisin is one of the finest\r\nraisins in the world, and in the opinion of the author superior to both\r\nSpanish and California raisins. They excel in sweetness and aroma as\r\nwell as flavor; their skin is thin, and the seeds are small. The color\r\nis entirely different from sun-dried California or Spanish raisins,\r\nbeing yellowish amber with a fine and thin bluish bloom, indicating that\r\nthey have been dried in the shade or in partial shade without dipping in\r\nlye or other solutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Location._--The number of acres devoted to raisin culture in Chile is\r\nnot known. The grapes for this purpose are grown almost exclusively in\r\nthe valley of the Huasco, back of the port of Huasco in the province of\r\nAtacama. There appear to be two distinct valleys of the same name, one\r\nsituated only twenty minutes’ ride from the port of Huasco on the\r\nPacific Ocean, the other farther inland about sixty miles from the\r\ncoast. In the former place, the culture of the raisin grape is very\r\nlimited, the whole valley and town only containing four hundred people,\r\nof which not all are occupied with the raisin industry. The interior\r\nvalley is more extensive, and the largest quantity of the Huasco raisins\r\ncome from this place. The port of Huasco is situated in latitude\r\ntwenty-seven degrees, thirty minutes south, longitude seventy-one\r\ndegrees, sixteen minutes west.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Muscatel or Gordo Blanco Raisin Grape, Second Crop.\r\nTwo-thirds Natural Size.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Varieties._--The grape used for raisins is a variety of the Muscat,\r\nvery similar to the Muscat of Alexandria. Grapevines transplanted to\r\nCalifornia resemble this variety very much, but, according to Professor\r\nHilgard, set their fruit better, and do not suffer so much from colure.\r\nIt is said that these grapes were imported to Chile long ago by the\r\nSpanish conquerors, and it is supposed they grew the vines from seed\r\nbrought from Spain, and selected the best of the seedlings. In this way\r\nthe slight difference of the Huasco grape from the Muscat of Alexandria\r\ncan be accounted for.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Soils._--The soil in the coast valley consists of a reddish, sandy\r\nloam, which changes to a fine yellow sand, of great richness. This sand\r\ncovers the hills almost everywhere in the vicinity of the Huasco river,\r\nthe nature of the country being a rolling one.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Climate._--The climate is notoriously dry, and rain falls only very\r\nseldom between June and September, is of short duration and very scant.\r\nIn the interior valley, rain is said to be seldom known, and the climate\r\nthere can be called entirely rainless. Dew is abundant in the winter,\r\nbut the summers are warm and dry.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Irrigation._--Near the coast no irrigation is required, but in the\r\ninterior valley the grapes are irrigated three times a year, first when\r\nthe buds begin to swell, second when they begin to blossom, and lastly\r\nwhen the fruit is well advanced.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Vineyard._--The vines are planted six feet one way by eight feet\r\nthe other, and the intermediate space is often planted to alfalfa,\r\ngiving three crops of hay each year. The heads are kept low, the vines\r\nare pruned heavily, and only two eyes left on each cane. Sometimes whole\r\nbranches are cut away, especially if they do not bear well. The vines\r\nare grown both on hillsides and in the valleys on the bottom lands. Many\r\nof the vineyards are surrounded by elevated arbors or trellises, over\r\nwhich the vines are trained, to keep off the heavy spring winds which\r\notherwise would break the branches,--windbreaks, in fact. The\r\ncultivation of the Huasco vines is of the most primitive kind. The land\r\nis poorly cultivated, and the fact that alfalfa is grown between the\r\nrows of the vines indicates that the industry is not highly developed.\r\nOn the other hand, it is not impossible that the crowding together of\r\nvarious things on the land may help to give the grapes a certain flavor\r\nor aroma.\r\n\r\nThere is said to be a great difference between the various Huasco\r\ngrapes, some being very superior to others. The inferior kinds are\r\ncalled simply Muscats, while the better kinds are the Huascos. It is not\r\nknown if these varieties come from different kinds of grapes, but it is\r\nlikely that this is the case. Vines of the best variety transplanted to\r\nother localities than the Huasco valley give invariably indifferent\r\nresults, and produce raisins inferior to the Huasco.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Drying and Curing._--The poorer qualities are simply dried on boards or\r\non the roofs of the houses in the sun; but the fine and most valuable\r\nraisins are dried in the shade. When ripe, the bunches are carefully\r\npicked and taken to open sheds with thatched roofs, and there hung up to\r\ndry. The raisins are turned at intervals, and when ready are packed in\r\ntwenty-five-pound boxes without any great care or skill. The best\r\nHuasco raisin sells at fifty cents per pound in the local market, and is\r\ndecidedly the most high-priced raisin known. The best variety is scarce\r\neven in Chile, and in Chilean statistics I could not find any quoted.\r\nThe following houses in Huasco are dealers in fruits and raisins: Juan\r\nQuijada, Ramon F. Martinez, and José Manuel Balmaceda. The export from\r\nthe port of Huasco in 1885 amounted only to $685,853. How large a\r\nportion of this was raisins is not known.\r\n\r\n\r\n_CALIFORNIA RAISIN DISTRICTS._\r\n\r\n\r\nA GENERAL REVIEW.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Early History._--While the planting of raisin grapes and the production\r\nof raisins in California dates back some thirty odd years, the raisin\r\nindustry cannot be said to be as yet twenty years old. Already, in 1851,\r\nCol. Agoston Haraszthy grew Muscatel vines from seeds of Malaga raisins.\r\nOn the 25th of March, 1852, he imported the Muscat of Alexandria from\r\nMalaga, and ten years later, during a visit to that place on September\r\n27, 1861, he selected cuttings of the Gordo Blanco which afterwards were\r\ngrown and propagated on his San Diego county vineyard. The same year he\r\nimported Sultana vines from Malaga, and white and red Corinth from\r\nCrimea. Col. Haraszthy was thus the first one to introduce the\r\nraisin-vines in this State. Another importation of the ovoid Muscat of\r\nAlexandria was made in 1855 by A. Delmas and planted at San José,\r\naccording to a statement made by his son D. M. Delmas,[3] the prominent\r\nSan Francisco lawyer. G. G. Briggs of Davisville also imported Muscatel\r\ngrapes from Malaga in Spain; while R. B. Blowers of Woodland, Yolo\r\ncounty, started his raisin vineyard in 1863 from Gordo Blanco cuttings\r\nreceived from Col. Haraszthy. In 1876, W. S. Chapman, imported the best\r\nMuscatels from Spain for his colonists in the Central California Colony\r\nin Fresno, which proved in no way different from those already growing\r\nthere. Who produced the first raisins in California will probably never\r\nbe satisfactorily known. According to page 88 of the Report of the State\r\nAgricultural Society of California, 1863, cured raisins were exhibited\r\nby Dr. J. Strentzel at the State Fair in 1863.[4] The first successful\r\nraisin vineyards in the State were those planted by G. G. Briggs at\r\nDavisville in Solano county, and by R. B. Blowers at Woodland in Yolo\r\ncounty. Both these gentlemen grew the raisin grapes on a large scale,\r\nand shipped raisins extensively. The Briggs vineyard consisted mainly of\r\nMuscats of Alexandria, while the Blowers vineyard contained the Gordo\r\nBlanco. Both these vineyards produced raisins as early as 1867; but it\r\nwas not until 1873 that their raisins cut any conspicuous figure in the\r\nmarket. That year six thousand boxes were produced in the State, the\r\nmajority by far coming from these two vineyards.\r\n\r\n  [3] See also Wickson’s “California Fruits,” page 357.\r\n\r\n  [4] _Same_, page 79.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Later Planting._--In 1873, in the fall, the Muscat vines were first\r\nbrought to the Fresno raisin district, where twenty-five acres of Muscat\r\nof Alexandria were planted in the Eisen vineyard. A few years later, or\r\nin 1876 and 1877, T. C. White planted the Raisina Vineyard in the\r\nCentral California Colony near Fresno from Gordo Blanco Muscatels\r\nbrought from R. B. Blowers’ vineyard at Woodland. The following year, or\r\nin 1877-78, Miss M. F. Austin began improving her Hedgerow Vineyard,\r\nalso in the same colony, with grapes of the same kind as Messrs. White\r\nand Blowers. Robert Barton had also planted some twenty-five acres of\r\nMuscat grapes, but did not make raisins until later. The year 1879 saw\r\nthe first planting of the A. B. Butler vineyard, now the largest\r\nvineyard in the State. J. T. Goodman had begun improving his place at\r\nthe same time; while Col. William Forsyth entered upon raisin-grape\r\ngrowing between 1881 and 1882, most of his grapes, however, being\r\nplanted a year or two later. From that time the raisin vineyards in\r\nFresno multiplied rapidly, and about 1886 and 1887 raisin production\r\nbecame recognized as the principal industry of the district.\r\n\r\nThe history of the development of the raisin industry in the other\r\ndistricts of the State runs very much the same. Riverside had entered\r\nthe field in 1873, when the founder of that colony, Judge John Wesley\r\nNorth, planted there the first raisin-vines of the variety Muscat of\r\nAlexandria. But raisin-grape growing did not become general until 1875\r\nand 1876, when the largest vineyards in the colony were planted. In El\r\nCajon valley in San Diego county, the first raisin vines of the Muscat\r\nof Alexandria variety were planted in 1873 by R. G. Clark; but the\r\nraisin industry did not get a good start until some six or seven years\r\nago, while most of the vineyards were planted from 1884 to 1886. In\r\nOrange county, raisin grapes were planted at the same time as in\r\nRiverside and El Cajon by MacPherson Bros., near Orange, now called\r\nMacPherson. The raisin industry developed rapidly, and Robert\r\nMacPherson, the largest grower and packer in the district, and at one\r\ntime in the State, handled yearly over one hundred thousand boxes, while\r\nthe yearly crop of the district rose to one hundred and seventy thousand\r\nboxes.\r\n\r\nIn Central California, the raisin industry is gradually spreading from\r\nthe original center around Fresno, the greater freedom from rain and the\r\nbetter facilities for irrigation being great inducements for the\r\nsettlers to engage in the growing and curing of the raisin grapes. The\r\nSan Joaquin valley is especially adapted to the production of raisins,\r\nthe Fresno raisin district being by far the largest, and now producing\r\nalmost one-half of the raisin crop of the State. In San Bernardino\r\ncounty and district, the raisins are also grown to great profit and with\r\ngreat facility, and are of equal quality with those of the interior of\r\nthe State. But the raisin industry is here gradually giving way to the\r\nculture of oranges and other citrus fruits, and the increase in the\r\nraisin acreage has therefore not been so great as in the San Joaquin\r\nvalley. In El Cajon, irrigation is not used, and the raisins produced\r\nthere are very similar to the Malaga raisins, but through absence of\r\nirrigation the crops are smaller than in any of the other districts in\r\nthe State. In Los Angeles and Orange county district, the raisin\r\nindustry has suffered immensely from the ravages of the vine plague, an\r\nas yet entirely mysterious disease, and the output of raisins there has\r\ndwindled down to almost nothing. But the farmers of the district are\r\nready to replant whenever there are any prospects that the vines will do\r\nwell again.\r\n\r\nIn the interior of California, north of Solano and Yolo counties, large\r\nquantities of raisin grapes have been planted during the last few years,\r\nboth in the foothill valleys, out on the plains, and in the bottom lands\r\nof the Sacramento, Yuba and Feather rivers, etc. Raisins of very good\r\nquality have been produced in that part of the State for years in\r\nlimited quantities, but it is yet a question to what extent that section\r\ncan compete with the central and southern parts of the State. In Sutter\r\ncounty around Yuba City the cultivation of a seedless raisin grape is\r\nadvancing rapidly, the raisins made from it being of excellent quality\r\nand finding a ready market.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Acreage and Crops._--The quantity of raisin-vines planted cannot be\r\nestimated correctly; but it is certain that at least sixty-five thousand\r\nacres of Muscat vines are now set out in the State, including grapes in\r\nbearing, as well as vines lately set out.\r\n\r\nCalifornia enjoys a climate peculiarly adapted to the culture and curing\r\nof the raisin grape. The summers are warm and rainless, the winters\r\nagain moderately rainy. The interior is free from injurious fogs and\r\nheavy dews, while the most southern coast is only visited by warm fogs,\r\nwhich are not greatly harmful to the grapes. Irrigation is practiced\r\nalmost everywhere, except in El Cajon valley, and in some of the\r\nnorthern districts of the State, but even there it is no doubt that\r\njudicious irrigation would be beneficial and greatly increase the crop.\r\nThe demand for California raisins has kept pace with the improvements in\r\ncuring and packing, and has steadily increased from year to year. What\r\nthe future has in store only the future can tell, but it is almost\r\ncertain that first-class raisins will always be in demand, while\r\ninferior grades may from time to time bring lower prices. The ruling\r\nprice of raisins in sweatboxes, as they may be had from those growers\r\nwho do not pack themselves, has been from four to five cents per pound.\r\nOf late years, the tendency is developing to pay according to quality,\r\nand from three to seven cents was the ruling price for unpacked raisins\r\nin sweatboxes during last season (1889). This practice will greatly\r\npromote the raisin industry and encourage growers to grow large grapes\r\nand fine bunches, and to cure their raisins well. It will also benefit\r\nthe buyers, who will know what they pay for, and who will be able to\r\nfurnish better grades, and more of the best grades than formerly, when\r\ngood, bad and indifferent raisins brought five cents per pound.\r\n\r\nThe raisin crop of 1889 did not exceed one million boxes. Should we\r\nventure upon a statement as to the distribution of the same among the\r\nvarious counties or districts of the State, the following figures would\r\nbe found as near correct as it is possible to get them:\r\n\r\n  Fresno district         475,000 twenty-pound boxes.\r\n  Tulare                   15,000    “     “     “\r\n  Kern                      4,000    “     “     “\r\n  Yolo and Solano         120,000    “     “     “\r\n  Scattering               25,000    “     “     “\r\n  San Bernardino          265,000    “     “     “\r\n  Orange and Los Angeles    8,000    “     “     “\r\n  San Diego                75,000    “     “     “\r\n                          -------\r\n                          987,000    “     “     “\r\n\r\n\r\nYOLO AND SOLANO.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Location and Acreage._--The district is situated north of San Francisco\r\nBay, bordering on it as well as on the Sacramento river, and is a part\r\nof the Sacramento valley. The number of acres overreaches seven\r\nthousand, and is increasing yearly. The principal vineyards are those of\r\nthe late G. G. Briggs at Davisville, Solano county, with three hundred\r\nacres, and at Woodland in Yolo county, four hundred and sixty acres; E.\r\nGould, also at Davisville, two hundred acres; H. M. Larou, at same\r\nplace, about fifty acres; sundry vineyards around Davisville, fifty\r\nacres; around Woodland and Capay valley, some four hundred acres;--or in\r\nfull bearing more than two thousand acres. The district comprises the\r\nsouthern part of Yolo and the northern part of Solano counties. The\r\ngrape used for raisins is principally the Muscat of Alexandria, except\r\nthe vineyard of R. B. Blowers, which is composed exclusively of Gordo\r\nBlanco. The Muscat of Alexandria is generally preferred, as it makes a\r\nfine raisin and bears well.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Soil and Climate._--The soil varies somewhat; the best is a deep gray,\r\nalluvial bottom-land soil; other soils are not much thought of for\r\nMuscatel raisin grapes. The average depth of water is about eighteen\r\nfeet from the surface. It is not necessary, as a rule, to first level\r\nthe land, as the ground is very level naturally. The rainfall averages\r\nthirteen inches. The most rain falls in January and February; the least\r\nfalls in August. There is seldom a shower in the summer, but about\r\nNovember 1st rains are almost always certain to interfere with the\r\ndrying of the grapes. Sometimes the rain comes in October, when it\r\ncauses considerable damage to the grapes and partially dried raisins.\r\nThere is very little dew in summer time, but plenty in October and also\r\nsome in September. The temperature is considerably modified by the\r\nnearness of the bay. It reaches in the hottest part of the summer one\r\nhundred and fourteen degrees Fahrenheit in the shade, but only for a day\r\nor two. The average highest is about ninety degrees Fahrenheit in the\r\nshade, while the heat almost every day in July and August shows\r\neighty-five degrees Fahrenheit in the shade. Thus this district is\r\nconsiderably cooler than the San Joaquin valley and San Bernardino\r\ncounty, but warmer than Los Angeles and San Diego districts. There are\r\nheavy frosts in winter, when at times even the thermometer falls to\r\neighteen degrees Fahrenheit, although this is the extreme low\r\ntemperature, six or seven degrees of frost being more common. There is\r\nspring frost in April one year in every three or four, and the vineyards\r\nare then smoked to prevent injury to the vines. Irrigation is not needed\r\nto produce crops, only to produce larger crops, as it increases the\r\nyield fifty per cent. Generally two irrigations a year are needed, the\r\nfirst one in early summer, the other later, when the berries have begun\r\nto ripen. Water from ditches is used and carried to the vines in furrows\r\nonly, no flooding being practiced.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Vineyard._--In planting, cuttings are used principally, but rooted\r\nvines are preferred by some. The distances most common are ten by ten\r\nfeet each way, one vineyard being set ten feet by sixteen feet. The\r\nvines bear the third year. The ground is plowed and cross-plowed, the\r\nfirst plowing being from the vines, and the second to the vines.\r\nHarrowing and cultivating both ways are secondary operations, continued\r\nto the middle of May, but seldom later. Hoeing the vines finishes the\r\nwork of the soil in the middle or end of May.\r\n\r\nIn pruning, the crowns are never raised over six inches above the\r\nground, from seven to eight spurs are left on large vines, and each spur\r\nis pruned to two or three eyes each. Formerly more eyes, say from four\r\nto five, were left on each cane, but it was found that this was too\r\nmany, hence the change to two or three eyes. Summer pruning is practiced\r\nby some, but not by all; there is yet a controversy in regard to its\r\nusefulness. When practiced, the vines are cut six or eight inches from\r\nthe tops, and this is done not later than June. Sulphuring is in use\r\neverywhere; the vines are sulphured two times, once before and once\r\nafter the bloom. Sulphured vines do not suffer from mildew. Colure, or\r\nthe dropping of the young berries, is not common, the Muscat of\r\nAlexandria even setting well. The leaf-hopper (_Erythroneura comes_) is\r\nmore common in some years than in others. They eat the leaves and cause\r\nthe grapes to sunburn. Grasshoppers have never caused any damage. Grape\r\nmoths are more or less common, but never troublesome. Black-knot is\r\noften seen on neglected vines, but is rare in old vineyards well cared\r\nfor.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Crop._--The grapes ripen in September, generally from the first to\r\nthe tenth. The drying and curing occupies three weeks. The bunches are\r\nplaced on trays made of pine two feet by three. Several growers have\r\nartificial dryers, which are needed for curing the second crop. The\r\nsweatboxes are large enough to contain seventy pounds of raisins, and\r\nare eight inches deep. In the Briggs raisin vineyard, the following\r\nbrands are packed: three crown Layer Muscatels; two crown Layer\r\nMuscatels; one and two crown Loose Muscatels; Dehesas and Seedless\r\nMuscatels. The raisins are seldom sold in sweatboxes, and no fixed price\r\nis known for such raisins. Most growers pack their own raisins. The\r\noldest raisin vineyard is that started by the late G. G. Briggs, and now\r\nowned by his widow. The most renowned vineyard was that owned by R. B.\r\nBlowers of Woodland, which has of late years been mostly replaced by\r\nother crops. Raisin land can be had for from one hundred to one hundred\r\nand fifty dollars per acre. This is vacant land of the very best\r\nquality. An average profit of fifty dollars per acre is realized,\r\nalthough some have made more money out of their vines. A yield of two or\r\nthree tons of grapes per acre is common. As regards prices of labor,\r\netc., the following were those most common last season: Man and team,\r\nwho boards himself and animals, three dollars and twenty-five cents per\r\nday, can plow one and a half acres of vineyard well. Pruning, one man,\r\none dollar per day, can prune three hundred vines, or three-fourths of\r\nan acre. Laborers generally board themselves. The raisins of this\r\ndistrict were the first ones in the State or on this continent to\r\nattract attention, and they were the first which successfully competed\r\nwith Spain. The crop of 1889 reached one hundred and twenty thousand\r\nboxes.\r\n\r\n\r\nNORTHERN CALIFORNIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n_General Remarks._--The Muscatel and Sultana raisin grapes grow almost\r\neverywhere in the State, and it is therefore natural enough that the\r\nplanting of raisin-vines should have increased considerably of late\r\nyears, even in localities situated outside of those raisin districts\r\nmentioned, which have already made a success of the raisin industry.\r\nBelow will be found a few notices from various such places which aspire\r\nto raisin fame, some of which have yet to make their reputation in this\r\nline. These notices are partly taken from the San Francisco _Chronicle_,\r\nwhich paper went to the trouble and expense of collecting such\r\nstatistics at the beginning of the year. It must be remembered, however,\r\nthat these statements are more or less approximate. As will be seen, all\r\nthese localities here mentioned lie in the interior or the Sacramento\r\nvalley proper, enjoying an inland climate. The climate in this valley is\r\nsomewhat like that of the San Joaquin valley, of which it is an\r\nextension. Only the heat in summer is less, the rain in winter is more\r\nprofuse, the showers in the spring of the year are later and those of\r\nthe fall are earlier.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Placer County._--At Rocklin J. P. Whitney has two hundred and fifty\r\nacres of raisin grapes, and is the largest raisin-maker in the county.\r\nThere are not over three hundred and fifty acres of Muscats devoted to\r\nraisin-making in the county, and the total output this year was about\r\nfour hundred tons, most of which was shipped directly East. The first\r\ncarload of Muscat raisins sent East was shipped from the Whitney\r\nvineyard about ten years ago. A large area of Muscat and other vineyards\r\nwill be planted this season, but none for raisin-making.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Yuba County._--The raisin industry has received but little attention in\r\nYuba county, although it has long been known that raisins of superior\r\nquality can be produced here. The area in raisin-vines is about three\r\nhundred acres, which will probably be increased by several hundred acres\r\nthis season. Less than a hundred acres are in bearing. The raisin\r\nvineyards planted last season are chiefly at Colmena, midway between\r\nMarysville and Wheatland. The Muscatel grape is planted to some extent,\r\nbut the favorite grape is the Thompson Seedless, a new variety of great\r\npromise.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sutter County._--The raisin industry of Sutter county dates back to the\r\nyear 1876, and the venture was first made by the late Dr. S. R. Chandler\r\nthree miles south of this city. The area now in raisin vineyard is about\r\nsix hundred acres, three-fourths of which are in bearing. The crops\r\nmarketed and prices received are about as follows: Three thousand\r\ntwenty-pound boxes at $1.65 per box; eight hundred sacks of one hundred\r\npounds each, at five cents a pound; five hundred and twenty-five sacks\r\nof dried grapes of one hundred pounds each, at three cents a pound. The\r\nhome consumption is extensive, but is not estimated. The county is well\r\nadapted to raisin growing and curing, and received the second prize at\r\nthe late Oroville State Citrus Exposition. Muscatel and Thompson\r\nSeedless are the favorite grapes. The soil of this county is very rich\r\nand warm, and no irrigation has been practiced.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Colusa County._--In the immediate vicinity of Colusa there are about\r\none hundred and fifty acres in bearing, and fully one hundred acres more\r\nwill be set out the coming season. The crop of raisins in 1888 was very\r\ninsignificant; but in 1889 the Colusa canneries packed forty tons in\r\nboxes. The prices ranged from $1.75 to $2.25 per box, according to\r\nquality. These figures refer only to the territory lying within a radius\r\nof eight miles of Colusa. Some of the finest raisin grapes in the county\r\nare grown near College City, and the entire output was at least eighty\r\ntons of raisins. Many of the people around Orland are reported as going\r\ninto the business on a large scale. The ranchers in and near the\r\nfoothills are also producing raisins of excellent quality. A single\r\nvineyard of fifteen hundred acres is being planted in one place in the\r\nfoothills.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Butte County._--While Butte produces a fair quality of raisins, her\r\nvineyards are yet young and are just coming into bearing. The older\r\nvines are those of General Bidwell, at Chico, covering about one hundred\r\nacres, and those of Oroville and Mesilla valley, embracing about the\r\nsame area. A large number of young vines have been set out during the\r\npast two years, and these number 52,200 near Oroville, 77,480 at\r\nPalermo, 67,200 at Thermalito, 20,570 at Wyandotte, 25,000 at Central\r\nHouse, 50,500 at Gridley, and something over 50,000 near Chico. These\r\nhave nearly all been planted within the past two years, but a limited\r\nnumber are three years old. In the foothills are a number of small\r\nvineyards, but it is impossible to ascertain the acreage and product,\r\nthough the total of each is not large. Practically the bearing vines of\r\nButte number between 300 and 400 acres. The one and two year old\r\nvineyards embrace about 350 acres, so that a conservative estimate for\r\nthe total raisin vineyards of the county, young and old, would be 700\r\nacres. The raisins are all boxed and sold directly by the vineyardists,\r\nthe local demand taking nearly the whole crop. The area to be planted\r\nthis year will not exceed 250 acres.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tehama County._--The area planted to grapes in Tehama county is over\r\nten thousand acres. The greater part of the fruit grown is used for\r\nwine, and probably one-third for raisins. All the raisins produced here\r\nare packed in boxes, and a large portion is used in home consumption,\r\nwhile the remainder is shipped. Probably about ten thousand boxes in\r\nbulk and packed will cover the yield.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Shasta County._--The raisin industry of Shasta county is only in its\r\ninfancy. There are 147 acres planted to raisin grapes within a radius of\r\nfifteen miles from Redding. The largest acreage of raisin grapes is in\r\nHappy valley. There are patches of grapes all through the foothills.\r\nProbably not over one thousand boxes of raisins were shipped. The\r\nplanting of raisin grapes continues every year. Raisins are made by many\r\nsmall growers, and sold here at an average of six cents per pound.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRESNO AND SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n_General Remarks._--The San Joaquin valley is well adapted to raisins\r\nalong its whole length almost, but especially in its central and\r\nsouthern parts. The farther we go south in the valley, the drier is the\r\nclimate, and the less is the rainfall in the autumn of the year, both\r\nconditions favoring the curing of the grapes. The present raisin center\r\nis around Fresno City, where over twenty-five thousand acres are planted\r\nto raisin grapes, principally Muscatels; but from this locality the\r\nindustry has been constantly spreading, until at present the other\r\ncounties in the valley, viz., Merced, Tulare and Kern, can show a good\r\nacreage of young vines. Next after Fresno, Tulare county produces the\r\nlargest quantity of raisin grapes, and produces raisins of the very\r\nhighest quality. The principal raisin vineyards in that county are\r\nsituated in the Mussel Slough district, on the rich bottom lands formed\r\nby the former delta of Kings river; of late, the planting of raisin\r\ngrapes has extended to other parts of the county as well. In Kern county\r\nfew old raisin vineyards exist, the oldest one being situated on the\r\nLivermore ranch, being a part of the Haggin and Carr tract. Several\r\nhundred new acres have been planted there this spring, especially in the\r\nRosedale, Lerdo and Virginia Colonies, as well as on the plains near\r\nDelano. I need here hardly say that the raisins of Fresno, Tulare, Kern\r\nand Merced counties should be all classed together, as the climate in\r\nthese various localities is one and the same, with only a slight and\r\ngradual change as to rainfall as we go south in the valley. If there\r\nwill, in the course of time, be found some difference as regards quality\r\nin the raisins of these various localities in the San Joaquin valley,\r\nthis difference will not be due to any great difference in the climate,\r\nbut to the variety of soil on which the grapes are grown. The raisins\r\nare only grown on the level lands, situated from three to four hundred\r\nfeet above the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Extent and Location._--The Fresno district contains about thirty\r\nthousand acres, out of which about twelve thousand are in good or full\r\nbearing. Merced county has about two thousand acres, nearly all very\r\nyoung vines. Kern county has probably about one thousand acres, also\r\nvery young vines, and some thirty acres of old vines. Tulare county has\r\nabout seven thousand acres of Muscats, a large part of which is in full\r\nor good bearing. Many vineyards, large and small, are being planted in\r\nthese counties this year, but enough attention is not paid to proper\r\nsoil and to locality, and here, as elsewhere in the State, many of these\r\nvineyards will not turn out as the owners expect they will. In Fresno\r\ncounty, the old vineyards are planted principally around Fresno City,\r\nwhile in late years other raisin districts or sub-districts are growing\r\ninto prominence around Malaga, Sanger, Selma, Fowler and Madera. The\r\nvarieties used are principally the Gordo Blanco Muscatel, much mixed\r\nwith the Muscat of Alexandria. There are some few acres of Sultanas and\r\nWhite Corinths, and of late many Malagas have been planted.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Soils and Climate._--There are several different varieties of soils in\r\nthe district,--the red or chocolate-colored sandy loam principally east\r\nof the railroad, the white, ashy soil west of the railroad, and the very\r\nsandy soil, generally occurring in elevated ridges. We have also the\r\ndeep, gray-colored bottom land in the river bottoms or along the rivers\r\nand creeks. The best grades of the chocolate and reddish loams, and of\r\nthe river bottom soil, is considered the best for raisins. The very\r\nsandy soil and the alkali soil should not be used for raisin purposes.\r\nThe climate is warm and dry during the summer, while the winters are not\r\nvery rainy. From seven to ten inches of rain are an average in Fresno;\r\nsouth to Kern the rainfall decreases, five and a half inches being an\r\naverage around Delano. Towards the northern end of the valley, the\r\nrainfall increases, and in Merced county varies between ten and twenty\r\ninches, fifteen inches being a high average. In no portion of the\r\nraisin-producing portion of the valley can raisin grapes be grown\r\nwithout irrigation, the natural rainfall being entirely insufficient.\r\nThe lowest temperature is about eighteen degrees Fahrenheit in Fresno,\r\ngenerally in January, while the highest is one hundred and eighteen\r\ndegrees Fahrenheit in the shade in July and August. The lowest\r\ntemperature is reached once in from three to five years, and the highest\r\nquoted is similarly scarce. The high average in summer time is one\r\nhundred and ten in the shade, and for three months of the year the\r\nthermometer every day can be counted on to vary between one hundred and\r\none hundred and ten in the shade. In the winter, twenty degrees\r\nFahrenheit is often reached, and the end of December and January may be\r\ncounted on as being cold and frosty. These figures all refer to the\r\nlevel plain land, where the most of the vineyards are planted, and not\r\nto the foothills or the thermal belt, nor to the high Sierra Nevada,\r\nwhere snow and ice are common, and where glaciers cover many of the\r\nhighest mountain peaks. The most rainfall occurs from December to\r\nFebruary, and the rain continues more or less scattering to April and\r\nMay. There is only very seldom a shower in the summer, one perhaps in\r\nthree years. In the mountains, the fall rains commence about the middle\r\nof August, on the plains again in October and November, sometimes even\r\nlater. Dew is rare in summer time, but common from the beginning of\r\nOctober. Fog is rare, sometimes an unwelcome visitor in November, but\r\nnever known at any other time of the year. Spring frosts are almost\r\nunknown, and occur only once in from five to eight years.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Irrigation._--Irrigation is practiced wherever raisins are grown. The\r\nwater is taken from the rivers,--from Kings river in the Fresno\r\ndistrict, and from the Merced, Kaweah and Kern rivers, etc., in the\r\nother districts. Before irrigation was begun in the Fresno districts,\r\nthere were from fifty to sixty feet of dry soil before the natural water\r\nlevel was reached; but this has been so changed through a few years of\r\nconstant irrigation, that now in places the land is subirrigated or\r\nmoist to the surface, while in places even the soil requires to be\r\ndrained, and no other irrigation is now needed except to allow the water\r\nto flow in the main or secondary canals, from which it seeps and keeps\r\nthe soil filled with water, the moisture rising from below. The\r\nirrigation when practiced is done by flooding or by irrigating in\r\nfurrows. New land must be irrigated until it becomes subirrigated; but,\r\nwhen once this is done, no separate irrigation becomes necessary. Many\r\nvineyards planted on subirrigated land which was once dry land have\r\nnever since been irrigated.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Vineyard._--The general distance of the vines is eight by eight or\r\nten by ten feet, varying in different vineyards. Of late, there have\r\nbeen some efforts made to improve upon these distances, and to have\r\nthem planted closer one way than the other, say five by ten or six by\r\ntwelve feet. The vines begin to bear the second and third years, and if\r\nplanted on proper soil should pay the fourth year and give an income the\r\nfifth year. Some vines have been known to pay the third year, there\r\nbeing much difference in this respect. Both cuttings and rooted vines\r\nare used, rooted vines having been preferred during the last few years.\r\nThe ground is plowed in various ways in the winter time, according to\r\nthe ideas of the owner. Cross-plowing is sometimes practiced. The\r\ngeneral rule is to first plow one way, and then to cross-cultivate\r\nrepeatedly until the soil is level and the weeds are destroyed. In wet\r\nplaces, the cultivation is kept up until July, but in proper places the\r\nworking of the soil is finished in the early part of June.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pruning and Other Operations._--The heads of the vines are kept\r\nlow,--from six to sixteen inches above the ground. The canes are cut to\r\ntwo or three eyes, and the number of canes left vary from five to\r\nfifteen or more. The pruning is done between December and February.\r\nSummer pruning is practiced by some, but not by all growers, there being\r\nconsiderable difference of opinion as to the value of this operation.\r\nSulphuring is practiced by all growers, some sulphuring only once, but\r\nthe best vineyards are sulphured three or more times. Oidium or mildew\r\nnever appears in sulphured vineyards. Some few growers sulphur with\r\ngreat success against the colure or dropping of the grapes. Leaf-hoppers\r\nare common, but do no great harm. Grasshoppers and grape caterpillars\r\nwere troublesome one or two seasons, but have not reappeared of late.\r\nBlack-knot is common in many places.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Crop._--The grapes begin to ripen in the middle of August, or from\r\nthe middle of August to the first of September, and at the latter date\r\nthe first boxes of cured and packed raisins are generally heralded\r\nthrough the press. The first grapes dry in from seven to ten days, but\r\nthe later grapes require three weeks or more. The drying continues\r\nthrough September, and for the second crop through October and even in\r\nNovember, or until the rains set in. The grapes are dried on trays two\r\nby three or three by three feet. The sweatboxes are generally two by\r\nthree feet and from six to eight inches high. A large number of brands\r\nare packed, such as Imperial Clusters, Dehesas, Layers, Loose and\r\nSeedless. The common price for raisins in sweatboxes is from three and a\r\nhalf to six cents, five and five and a half cents being the average for\r\ngood layers. Good land for raisin purposes can be had for one hundred\r\ndollars per acre, but nearer the town of Fresno is held higher. Bearing\r\nraisin vineyards have changed hands at as high as $1,000 per acre. From\r\none hundred to two hundred and fifty boxes of raisins are realized per\r\nacre, and the profits vary from seventy-five to two hundred and fifty\r\ndollars per acre, according to location, soil, management, etc. From\r\nthirty to fifty dollars per acre is spent yearly in many vineyards. Few\r\ndipped raisins are produced. Some dipped Sultanas have brought seven\r\ncents in the San Francisco market. Last season about four hundred and\r\nseventy-five thousand boxes were produced in the Fresno district, and\r\nsome twenty thousand boxes more in the other parts of the San Joaquin\r\nvalley.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAN BERNARDINO COUNTY AND RIVERSIDE.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Location and Acreage._--San Bernardino county, California, is entirely\r\nan inland county, sheltered by low and high hills from the ocean. Fogs\r\nand dew are rare, in places unknown, and the county offers unusual\r\nadvantages for raisin-growing. The vineyards are widely distributed\r\nthrough the county in different localities or raisin centers, all of\r\nwhich are greatly similar as to climatic conditions, except as regards\r\naltitude. The San Bernardino vineyards are the highest elevated above\r\nthe sea of any in California. Below will be found a list of the raisin\r\ncenters in the county, with the number of acres and their altitude above\r\nthe sea. It must be understood that each locality has a large extension\r\nas regards altitude, and varies in many instances several hundred feet;\r\nthis fact being indeed a characteristic of the San Bernardino county\r\nvineyards. The raisin centers in San Bernardino county are:\r\n\r\n  Riverside, 1,500 acres. Altitude above sea, 900 to 1,000 feet.\r\n  Redlands,    800   “        “      “    “ 1,200  “ 1,600 feet.\r\n  Highlands,   400   “        “      “    “          1,500 feet.\r\n  Ontario,     500   “        “      “    “   983  “ 2,350 feet.\r\n  Cucamonga,  ----   “        “      “    “   900  “ 1,500 feet.\r\n  Etiwanda,    700   “        “      “    “          1,200 feet.\r\n\r\nThere are several other localities where raisin vineyards are found in\r\nsmaller quantities, and it is safe to estimate the number of acres in\r\nthe county at over five thousand. Nearly all these vineyards are\r\nsituated on mesa lands, by which is meant the lands situated between the\r\nriver bottoms and the foothills. As a consequence, the surface water is\r\nnever near the top, but generally far down, and even continued\r\nirrigation would not be liable to raise it much higher, as the water\r\nwill as rapidly drain off through the substrata, which generally\r\nconsists of sandy soil and gravel. The land is in fact well drained, and\r\ndiffers in this respect from the plains of the San Joaquin valley. In\r\nRiverside, the surface water is from thirty to fifty feet down, and only\r\nin one or two vineyards situated deep down in the _arroyo_ is the\r\nsurface water as shallow as ten feet. These latter vineyards are never\r\nirrigated. In Redlands the surface water is at an average of thirty feet\r\non the mesa lands. In Ontario the surface water is even deeper, and\r\nfound at from seventy to eight hundred feet, and the shallowest water in\r\nthe district is, according to Mr. W. E. Collins, twenty-five feet below\r\nthe surface. It is the general belief in the San Bernardino district\r\nthat deep water is necessary for, or at least beneficial to, raisin\r\ngrapes, and that shallow surface water is conducive to all kinds of\r\ndiseases. In this I cannot agree, as contrary to my own experiences and\r\nto the experiences of the Spanish growers.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Climate._--As regards temperature, there is some difference in the\r\nvarious districts. A true comparison between them and other districts is\r\nalmost impossible, as the signal service thermometers are placed at\r\nunequal heights above the ground, and in localities with very different\r\ncharacteristics. It can, however, be said that the winter climate of the\r\ndistrict is much milder during the winter than that of the plains of the\r\nSan Joaquin valley, and very similar to the Orange county and the San\r\nDiego districts. In Riverside and Redlands, the thermometer seldom\r\nreaches one hundred and nine degrees Fahrenheit in the shade during the\r\nsummer, and in winter seldom goes below twenty-four degrees Fahrenheit,\r\nwhile twenty-eight or twenty-seven degrees Fahrenheit is no unusual\r\noccurrence once every year, but is considered the extreme of the season.\r\nIt may thus be seen that raisin vineyards and orange orchards may be and\r\nactually are grown side by side in every part of San Bernardino county,\r\nand this is a distinct characteristic of the district, which, however,\r\nit shares with Orange and San Diego counties. The warmest months are\r\nAugust and September, and October is generally fine for drying. So is\r\nNovember, and only twice (in 1885 and 1889) has there been any serious\r\ndifficulty in drying the grapes. In two other years the crop has\r\nsuffered slightly, but during the majority of seasons in the months of\r\nNovember there has not been any rain on the mesa lands, and it is this\r\nabsence of fall rains which makes it possible for the raisin-grower to\r\ndry his crop without any other appliances than raisin-trays. Dew and\r\nfogs are very rare, and occur only very seldom during the summer months.\r\nWhen they do occur at this time, they are of but short duration, and\r\nlast perhaps only from five to seven o’clock in the morning. In the fall\r\nof the year, in October and November, the desert wind blows warm and\r\ndry, and hastens the drying of the raisins. It may blow three or four\r\ntimes during the season, but has also been known to be entirely absent.\r\nThe rain in the winter season is light, in Riverside twelve inches being\r\nan exceptionally wet season. From six to eight inches are the usual\r\nrainfall, while again the actual average for Riverside is six and\r\none-fourth inches. In Ontario the rainfall in 1887 was 8.21 inches, and\r\nin 1888 9.23 inches.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Irrigation._--In Riverside grapes cannot be grown without irrigation on\r\nthe mesa lands, with the exception of one or two localities in the\r\narroyo. In the Ontario district, raisin grapes may be grown without\r\nirrigation in the center of the valley, but on the mesas, higher on the\r\nsides, they must be irrigated, and even in localities where they could\r\nbe grown without artificial irrigation the same is always practiced\r\nwhenever it can be obtained. Less water is, however, needed than in the\r\nSan Joaquin valley, but more than would suffice in El Cajon. Through the\r\nnature of the gravelly subsoil, the raisin land cannot fill up with\r\nwater. Seepage is only possible to a limited degree; summer irrigation\r\nis always required. The vines are irrigated three times a year, in\r\nApril, June and August. The system of furrows is used, and a ten-inch\r\nflow is considered enough to irrigate one acre of grapes during one day\r\nand night each time. In Ontario the raisin grapes are irrigated every\r\nfive weeks, not, however, while they are in bloom, as it is considered\r\nbest to wait until the berries are well set. In Redlands, one irrigation\r\nafter the winter rain ceases is considered enough, even on soil with\r\nthirty feet to water.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Soils._--The soil in San Bernardino county varies considerably. In\r\nRiverside and Redlands the best soil is a reddish loam, with some sand\r\nand gravel. But in Riverside we also find sandy soil of lighter color\r\nand strength, which, however, is less suited to grapes. In Ontario the\r\nsoil varies from a heavy clayey _adobe_ to a lighter but very rich sandy\r\nloam of a grayish color. The very sandy soil in some river bottoms,\r\nespecially around Lugonia, has, through experience, been found to be\r\nentirely unsuited to the raisin grapes.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Vineyards._--The variety used for raisins is nearly entirely the\r\nMuscat of Alexandria, although several vineyardists call these grapes\r\nincorrectly the Gordo Blanco. I saw nowhere this variety, but I suppose\r\nsome must have been imported there. In planting, cuttings have been\r\npreferred, probably because they are the cheapest, and because the value\r\nof rooted vines has not been properly understood. The vines are set,\r\nalmost everywhere, eight by eight, only in a few vineyards nine by nine\r\nfeet. There is, however, a growing belief that eight by ten feet or\r\neight by twelve feet is better than the old accepted eight by eight\r\nfeet. But I believe that this tendency to give the vines greater room\r\nwill, in course of time, be followed by the opposite tendency to plant\r\nthem closer, at least one way, and give more room the other way. The\r\nMuscat of Alexandria begins to bear in three years, and in four years\r\nwill pay fifty dollars per acre. The practice of plowing is, in\r\nRiverside, to first plow towards the vines in the fall, and then, when\r\nthe vegetation has begun in the spring, the soil is turned back towards\r\nthe center of the space between the rows, or from the vines. Then the\r\nsoil is cultivated with chisel-tooth cultivators, both crosswise and\r\nlengthwise, also similarly after every irrigation. But this practice is\r\nnot entirely the same everywhere, and the different vineyardists have\r\nhere as elsewhere different ideas, even in regard to the most common\r\nfarm or vineyard practices. Pruning was formerly done much closer than\r\nnow, but it was found that by close pruning the vines bore less. To-day\r\nfrom fifteen to twenty spurs are left on the strongest vines, and on\r\nevery spur about two eyes. From twenty to twenty-five spurs were found\r\nto be too much; with such quantity of spurs the vines produce smaller\r\nand inferior grapes. Some vines which were pruned with twenty-five spurs\r\nlast year have this year been given nine or ten spurs only, so as to\r\nenable them again to recover and grow strong, when the quantity of spurs\r\nwill again be increased to fifteen. Summer pruning is used by some, but\r\nnot by others. It does not, according to observation, injure the vine,\r\nbut produces always a second crop, which is difficult to cure.\r\nSulphuring the vines is practiced by some, but not by all, growers. A\r\ngreat many cannot see the use and value of sulphur. No one sulphurs for\r\ncolure or the dropping of the grape, which is quite a common occurrence.\r\nThe vines, however, never suffered from the leaf-hopper nor the grape\r\ncaterpillars, but sunscald is not uncommon, nor is black-knot.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Crop._--The Muscat grapes begin to ripen in Riverside later than in\r\nthe San Joaquin valley, and picking commences between the 10th and the\r\n30th of September. Highlands is said to be two weeks later than\r\nRiverside. The first crop is ready to turn in two weeks, and is ready\r\nfor the sweatbox in three weeks’ time. For drying, trays are used, and\r\nabout twenty pounds are placed on each tray. These trays are all made of\r\npine or fir. Redwood has been found unsuitable, as imparting both a\r\ncolor and a taste to the raisins if accidentally wet by early showers\r\nin the fall. Size of trays, two by three feet, with a cleat nailed at\r\nthe short ends, but none at the long ends of the trays. Sweatboxes\r\nreceive the raisins when they leave the trays. Formerly the sweatboxes\r\nwere much larger and deeper than now, eight or even twelve inches in\r\ndepth not being unknown. Of late sweatboxes are made two by three feet,\r\nor of the exact size of the trays, and not over six inches in depth. A\r\ngreater depth makes the boxes too heavy to handle, and also causes the\r\nbunches to break. The packing of the raisins in Riverside and in the\r\nSouthern California raisin districts generally is done by the method\r\nknown as “top up.” That is, the first raisins are placed in the bottom\r\nof the box and successive layers are placed on top, until finally the\r\ntop layer is put on the last. The lever press for the compression of the\r\nlayers is a Riverside invention. A modification of this press is now in\r\nuse in nearly all districts where the “top-up” method of packing is\r\npracticed. The brands packed are as follows: Three Crown London Layers,\r\nTwo Crown London Layers, Three Crown Loose Muscatels, Two Crown Loose\r\nMuscatels, and Muscatels in sixty-pound sacks; also Seedless Muscatels\r\nin sacks of sixty and thirty pounds respectively. Cotton sacks are\r\ncommonly used for the two latter brands. The brands are apt to vary from\r\nyear to year, according to the fancy or ideas of the packers, new ones\r\nof which are in the field every year. Only those who both produce and\r\npack have anything like established brands. The prices paid for raisins\r\nin sweatboxes have varied in different years. In 1887 and 1888, the\r\nprice was from four and one-half to five cents per pound. In 1889, the\r\nprice rose to five and five and three-fourths cents, and in one or two\r\ninstances six cents were paid.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Profits and Other Items._--The profit varies, of course, greatly,\r\nbut an average profit may be considered to be from about $125 to $150\r\nper acre. The yield of an acre is variable, but from eight to ten tons\r\nof fresh grapes is said not to have been uncommon. In some cases the\r\nyield has been much higher and the profit larger. I have from\r\ntrustworthy source the statement that one vineyardist who owns only a\r\nfew acres, I believe only five, and who has given all his time and\r\nattention to these vines, has realized as much as $430 per acre. This I\r\nquote only as an instance of what might be done with care and expense in\r\nan exceptionally favored locality. Some few growers have realized $250\r\nprofit on each of a few acres, which also is to be considered\r\nexceptional. I believe my former statement of $150 per acre as being\r\nreliable and attainable by all San Bernardino county raisin-growers who\r\nhave good land, and who give their vines sufficient care. As another\r\ninstance of a high yield, I copy below an account of the vintage of C.\r\nNewton Ross of Etiwanda, San Bernardino county, California. The article\r\nappeared in the _Press and Horticulturist_ of Riverside, September 27th,\r\nand I have every reason to consider it trustworthy. The writer adds that\r\nthe yield is extraordinary. “Mr. Ross has seventeen acres of 8,000 vines\r\nfive years old from which he picked 8,648 trays of grapes that average\r\ntwenty-five pounds to the tray, or a total of 108 tons of grapes, which\r\nwill make thirty-six tons of raisins,--equal to 3,600 boxes,--over 200\r\nboxes to the acre. This is the first picking only, and it is estimated\r\nthat the second crop will be half as large as the first, which will give\r\na total yield of 318 boxes to the acre. Mr. Ross has sold his first crop\r\nat five and one-half cents per pound in the sweatbox, which will give\r\nhim an income of $242 an acre on the first crop, and half as much more\r\non the second crop if he succeeds in saving it in good shape, or a total\r\nincome of $363 per acre on his crop. Mr. Ross estimates that $50 an acre\r\nwill cover the entire cost of taking care of the vineyard and putting\r\nthe crop in the sweatbox, and this would leave him a net income of $313\r\nan acre for his vineyard, which is ten per cent on $3,130 per acre.”\r\nBut, I may add, it is not likely that such a profit can be realized year\r\nafter year.\r\n\r\nAs regards care of the vineyard and expenses of running the same, they\r\nvary, of course, and are estimated at from twenty dollars upwards. But\r\nthe best vineyardists spend from thirty to forty dollars per acre in the\r\ncare of an acre, but in this do not include interest, trays bought,\r\netc., nothing in fact but “care.”\r\n\r\nVines were first planted in Riverside by Judge John Wesley North in\r\n1873. Vacant land that is suitable for raisins may be had with water for\r\n$250 per acre. Some land with choice locations is held at higher prices.\r\nThe highest yield of raisins in San Bernardino has been 290,000 boxes in\r\n1888. Of this Riverside produced 150,000 boxes, Etiwanda 30,000 boxes,\r\nand Ontario 15,000 boxes. The raisin shipments from Riverside during the\r\nfall of 1889, up to December 12th, amounted, according to the _Daily\r\nPress_, to 216,000 boxes. There was a balance on hand of 7,000 boxes,\r\nmaking the total production 223,000 boxes. It is estimated that the\r\nvalue of this crop was $3,500,000 at wholesale. Later advices give to\r\nthe county 265,000 boxes as last season’s crop. The San Bernardino\r\nraisins are superior both as regards quality and size, and raisin\r\ngrowing and curing is a profitable business, eminently suited to the\r\nsettler with small means, who cannot invest large capital, nor can\r\nafford to wait long for a return. No dipped or sulphured raisins have\r\never been produced in the district, although dipped raisins would prove\r\nprofitable. Especially does this refer to the second crop, which ripens\r\nenough to make good raisins, but which cannot be cured when the early\r\nrains set in.\r\n\r\n\r\nORANGE COUNTY AND SANTA ANA.\r\n\r\n\r\n_General Remarks._--On account of the vine disease which has been\r\ninjuring the Orange county raisin and wine vineyards, this district has\r\na special interest to every one engaged in grape-growing. While the\r\ncountry has received a hard blow through the injury and destruction of\r\nso many of its vineyards, still it is likely that it will recover and\r\nrise as soon as the vine disease leaves.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Location._--The Orange county raisin district lies close to the sea. Of\r\nall raisin districts, it is nearest the ocean, the average distance of\r\nthe raisin vineyards from the latter being eight to twelve miles, some\r\nfew perhaps a little more. As will be seen, the district resembles in\r\nthis respect some of the Mediterranean districts, such as Malaga and\r\nSmyrna, where the vineyards come within actual reach of the sea fogs. On\r\none side of the Orange county district we have the ocean, on the\r\nopposite side it is bordered by rather high foothills, beyond which are\r\nthe San Bernardino county vineyards, some forty to sixty miles away.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Raisin-grower’s Residence at Fresno.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Climate._--The nearness to the ocean modifies the climate much. The\r\ntemperature is more even all the year round than anywhere else on the\r\ncoast where raisins are grown. The extreme of heat is 105 degrees; in\r\nfact, July 27, 1889, it was 104 degrees Fahrenheit in the shade, while\r\nin the winter it seldom goes lower than 28 degrees Fahrenheit, and\r\nindeed very, very rarely as low as that. In many places there is no\r\nfrost at all, except, perhaps, one in April, which, of course, cannot\r\nbut prove damaging to the vines. This absence of heavy frost, which is\r\nbeneficial to every other semi-tropical product, is not favorable to the\r\nvine. The grape requires heavy frost to become dormant. The farther\r\nsouth we go the less frost and the less grapes, at least of the Asiatic\r\nkind. There are, as we know, native grapes even in tropical countries,\r\nbut they are adapted to their surroundings and cannot be considered\r\nhere. The proximity to the coast modifies the air considerably. With 100\r\ndegrees Fahrenheit in the shade, which is an exception here, I felt as\r\nwarm as I do in the San Joaquin valley with the mercury at 114;--the two\r\nextremes in both places affect us just the same. The air here is\r\ncertainly much more moist, which again must have a marked effect upon\r\nthe vine, and in no small degree promote fungoid growths, or parasites\r\ngenerally. In this respect, then, the coast vineyard must certainly be\r\nat a disadvantage. The fog is not an unusual visitor in the district\r\nbetween the coast and the foothills, which, in fact, covers the whole\r\narea ever planted in raisin grapes. For days in succession every morning\r\nis foggy, and the fog condenses on the leaves of the trees and falls\r\nunder them in real showers, making the adjoining and underlying road\r\nwet. For a few days again the sun will rise bright, again to be followed\r\nby foggy mornings. By from nine to eleven o’clock the fog is again gone\r\nand the sun shines brightly. Every evening and morning there is a heavy\r\ndew, and every branch, leaf or grass is then dripping wet. Several\r\nmornings when the fog was in I found the thermometer at 62 degrees\r\nFahrenheit, while at noon it rose to over 100.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Soils and Ripening._--The soil here is the very best, and I doubt if\r\nthe same fine quality of soil is found anywhere else in California over\r\nthe same extended territory. I ride for miles and miles, everywhere the\r\nfinest and richest loam of a gray color, sometimes a little drawing\r\ntowards slate blue, sometimes again towards yellowish. It is immensely\r\nrich, and can hardly be improved. There is, however, especially near\r\nOrange, a different kind of soil consisting of the sand loam, but\r\nintermixed with very coarse gravel. This soil is warmer but consequently\r\nnot so rich. The grapes ripen on it two weeks earlier, but yield only\r\none-half as much as those on the richest loam along the creeks. The\r\nvines planted here were alone the Muscat of Alexandria. Strangely enough\r\nI find no traces of Sultanas or currant, which latter, it seems, should\r\nbe especially adapted to the coast climate.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Vineyards._--In planting a vineyard, rooted vines were seldom used.\r\nCuttings grew so readily and so well that they were much preferred. I\r\nam told that five per cent loss was unusual. It must be remarked that\r\nthe moister is the air the better it is for any kind of cuttings. The\r\nmoisture sustains and nourishes the wood while it is making roots. As to\r\ndistances, I remarked nothing new. Eight by eight or eight by ten feet\r\nseems the generally adopted way. The nature of the soil and climate make\r\nhigher cultivation a necessity. McPherson Bros., who packed the largest\r\nquantity of raisins and owned the finest vineyards, told me that they\r\nplowed and cross-plowed and cultivated from fourteen to sixteen times\r\nevery season; in fact they never ceased working the ground. The pruning\r\nwas begun in December, or as soon as the leaves began to turn and fall.\r\nTo begin with, only a few spurs were left on every vine, and on every\r\nspur three eyes, including the bottom eyes, but experience taught that\r\nthat way was not the very best. Gradually more space was given the\r\nvines, and now from fifteen to twenty spurs to a vine in full bearing is\r\nconsidered proper. Summer pruning is only practiced in some of the\r\nvineyards where the ground is quite wet. The most profitable vineyards\r\nwere irrigated. The nearer the coast the more moisture there is in the\r\nsoil. Thus three miles west of Santa Ana the ground is always moist\r\nenough to grow grapes, but as we come nearer the foothills to the east,\r\nthe moisture is farther down. At Tustin, Orange, and especially at\r\nMcPherson, irrigation was practiced in all first-class vineyards. Some\r\nwere irrigated in the winter only, and this was considered the best;\r\nothers again were irrigated also once in summer,--a practice the best\r\nvineyardmen considered unnecessary and even injurious. I found land near\r\nthe town of Santa Ana moist one inch below the surface, where no\r\nirrigation had even been practiced. Sulphuring was used everywhere to\r\ncounteract the oidium. For this purpose powdered sulphur was dusted\r\nthrough the vines as soon as the grapes were as large as small shot.\r\nFrom three to four sulphurings were used every year with a week between\r\neach. Sulphuring for the colure or dropping of grapes was not known; in\r\nfact I am informed that this colure was seldom known. Besides mildew,\r\nthere are few enemies to the vine here. Grasshoppers, leaf-hoppers and\r\ngrape moths have never been known to molest the vines. When the late\r\nvine-plague struck the country the vineyardists were entirely unused to\r\nfight any enemy of the vines besides the oidium. Sunscald of the berries\r\nwas not known.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Crop and its Curing._--The grapes begin to ripen in the end of\r\nAugust, say about the twenty-fifth, on the gravelly soil, but on the\r\ncooler and richer bottom land very much later, or about the middle of\r\nSeptember. The harvest then begins; the grapes are picked on trays two\r\nand a half by three feet and placed to dry in the sun; the drying takes\r\ntwo or three weeks or more, and is accomplished with some difficulty.\r\nTwo years the grapes had to be carried out to the Mojave desert, to be\r\ndried there. The trays are placed among the vines in such a way that the\r\ntrays from three rows are placed in one. To protect them from the fog\r\nand dew, they are covered with canvas. This is done in two ways. One way\r\nis to put small pegs on one side of the trays. The long canvas is\r\nfurnished at intervals with rings, which are slipped over the pegs and\r\nthus held steady on one side. In the daytime the other end of the canvas\r\nis simply thrown back over the pegs; in the night-time the canvas is\r\nagain turned over the trays, resting directly on the grapes. The other\r\nand better way is to run three wires along the row of trays, one on each\r\nside of the trays. The canvas is furnished with rings on each long side,\r\nwhich are made to run on the wire. The center wire is run a little\r\nhigher up, and here and there simply supported by posts. It takes\r\ncomparatively little time every evening to run the canvas along the\r\nwires and cover the trays. The expense is considerable, both in\r\nfurnishing and preparing the canvas, and in maintaining and operating\r\nit. The peculiar climatic conditions of the district, however,\r\nnecessitate some such contrivance for the drying of the grapes. The\r\nvines seldom bear a second crop of any importance. Sometimes in October\r\nthe district is visited by a warm and dry desert wind called the Santa\r\nAna wind. It comes from the cañon of the Santa Ana river, and\r\noriginates, no doubt, in the Mojave desert, and rising high up in the\r\nair is again precipitated over the hills on the lowlands towards the\r\nocean. This Santa Ana wind is always welcome. It hastens the drying of\r\nthe grapes just as the _Terral_ or land winds from the plains of La\r\nMancha hasten the drying of the grapes of Malaga in Spain.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Yield and Profits._--The yield is quite small on the gravelly soil, at\r\nthe most being three tons of green grapes to the acre, on richer land\r\nfrom six to seven tons, and in rare instances ten tons to the acre. I\r\nheard of one vineyard where the owner had sold from twenty acres of\r\nMuscatels thirty-three tons of raisins and fifty-six tons of green\r\ngrapes, equal to about 155 tons from the lot. Another lot of three-year\r\nMuscatels bore ten tons to the acre,--indeed a very unusual yield\r\nanywhere for Muscatels. I hear reports of some wonderful yields and high\r\nprofits, but am informed by the most experienced and trustworthy that\r\n$125 per acre is an average profit which can be relied upon year after\r\nyear. The first Muscat vines were planted near Orange, now the station\r\nof McPherson, about 1873, by McPherson Bros. The acreage in grapevines\r\nin the Orange county district was about 8,000 acres; but probably over\r\nhalf of it is wine grapes. The highest output of raisins was 170,000\r\nboxes of twenty-pounds each.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAN DIEGO AND EL CAJON.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Location and Acreage._--The El Cajon and Sweetwater valleys are the\r\nraisin centers of San Diego county. The former contains about four\r\nthousand acres of Muscat vines, the latter about five hundred acres.\r\nMagnificent-looking Muscat grapes are also grown within three miles of\r\nSan Diego. Escondido is by many pronounced superior for raisin grapes to\r\nany of the other places; but El Cajon is the present center of the\r\nraisin industry, and is likely to remain so for years. The\r\nraisin-growing section of the two valleys lies from about fifteen to\r\nseventeen miles from the coast line, and at an altitude of from 450 to\r\n500 feet. The arable land in El Cajon valley contains 50,000 acres, or\r\nperhaps less, and consists of the rolling bottom of the valley, but\r\nwhich can in no way be classed as bottom land. The land partakes more\r\nof the characteristics of mesa or upland, and extends on all sides,\r\nslightly undulating upon the sides of the hills. Lower hills and behind\r\nthem, again, higher hills surround the valley, and the high peaks beyond\r\nthe Cuyamaca Mountains reach 4,500 feet or more. None of these hills or\r\nmountains in sight are covered with timber of any kind, and even the\r\nvalleys are without the usual sycamores. Only in the very narrow bottom\r\nof the creek is there a vegetation of willows and shrubbery.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Climate and Rainfall._--The rainfall of the valley varies considerably.\r\nIt has been known to be as little as six inches and as much as twenty,\r\nthe average probably being about twelve inches, distributed as generally\r\nelsewhere in California,--during the winter months. In summer time it\r\nseldom rains,--perhaps a shower in two or three years. September is the\r\nwarmest month, or at least the month with the greatest number of warm\r\ndays. The highest temperature reached in the shade in El Cajon is 105\r\ndegrees Fahrenheit, and in Sweetwater valley 108, and the coldest in the\r\nwinter twenty-four degrees Fahrenheit on the upper mesa land, while on\r\nthe lower land, close to the river, the temperature falls low enough to\r\nkill orange trees, probably somewhere about eighteen degrees Fahrenheit.\r\nSeptember is freer from fog than any other month. During the other\r\nsummer months there is fog in the morning two days out of three. The\r\nfog, however, is warm and pleasant to all but consumptives, but,\r\nnevertheless, leaves behind a soaking dew on all vegetation, and is even\r\nheavy enough to moisten the dust on the roads. The moisture on this mesa\r\nland--by which is meant all the land between the hills, which are too\r\nsteep to be plowed, and the actual river bottom lands--is near the\r\nsurface. In the El Cajon and Sweetwater valleys, the water is found on\r\nthis mesa at from eight to twenty feet, or at an average of from twelve\r\nto fifteen feet. On little hills or knobs in the valley the water is\r\nfound at about the same depth. It is strange that with the water so near\r\nthe surface no perennial vegetation of either shrubbery or trees should\r\nbe found on this land. The grapevines will grow on it without\r\nirrigation; in fact none is used anywhere now, but no doubt it would\r\nprove profitable to irrigate somewhat, so as to increase the crops of\r\ngrapes. Water can be had through the Cuyamaca flume, but has so far not\r\nbeen used. The vines do not grow after August 1st, and may stop growing\r\nsooner.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Soils._--The soils of the district are of four kinds: First, reddish\r\nclay mixed with gravel, the color changing between light chocolate and\r\ndeep reddish. This soil is considered by many the most desirable.\r\nSecond, a steel or slate gray adobe with much gravel of a coarse nature.\r\nThird, black adobe with little gravel. Fourth, alluvial sandy soil,\r\napparently consisting of decomposed granite mixed with much vegetable\r\nmatter. This soil is coarse, of a dark steel-gray color, very easily\r\nworked; it is considered the best for raisins, but it contains streaks\r\nwhere they will not grow and prove profitable. The last-named soil goes\r\ngradually over into common alluvial soil of a sandy nature. The two\r\nlast-named soils are found principally in the Sweetwater valley.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Vines and the Vineyard._--In planting, cuttings are generally used,\r\nnot because they are most preferred, but because good rooted vines\r\ncannot be obtained. The distance to, and the difficulty of reaching,\r\nthis district was formerly such that roots would suffer in transit and\r\nwould rapidly dry, while cuttings could be had handy and fresh. The\r\nvines, originally planted eight by eight feet, have been given more\r\ndistance of late, some vineyardists planting them eight by twelve feet,\r\nwhile others prefer twelve by twelve or ten by twelve feet. The\r\nvarieties used are the Muscat of Alexandria only. This variety happened\r\nto be the one that was imported first from Riverside, I believe, and it\r\nwas afterwards propagated by every one. The variety as grown in El Cajon\r\nis the type of Muscat of Alexandria with oblong berries, large clusters\r\nwith loosely hanging berries and large strong stems. The shape of the\r\nvines is erect, with a few center shoots, strong and upright. The vines\r\ncommence bearing the second year, and are said to pay expenses of caring\r\nfor in the third year, but I think it would be safer to say in the\r\nfourth year.\r\n\r\nAs regards cultivation and plowing, many plow both ways and harrow and\r\ncultivate crosswise several times until the 1st of June, when, on\r\naccount of the dryness of the soil, no more weeds start and no\r\ncultivation of any kind is needed. The large majority of the vineyards\r\nare splendidly kept, not a weed being seen anywhere for miles around.\r\nWinter pruning commences as soon as the leaves fall. In former years\r\nfrom five to nine spurs were left in pruning and two or three eyes on\r\neach spur, but it has been found profitable and judicious to leave more\r\nspurs, so as to take the sap in the spring, and now from twelve to\r\nfifteen spurs with two or three eyes each are left every winter. Spring\r\nor summer pruning has only been practiced the last two seasons, and\r\nbeing found very profitable is now adopted by everybody. The vines are\r\nnot pinched, but headed well back as soon as the grapes are well set.\r\nThis method has in this district the following advantages: It gives\r\nbetter shade to the bunches on account of the production of a strong\r\nsecond growth; it causes the bunches to fill better, and, finally, it\r\nleaves more room between the rows of the vines. I was told that any of\r\nthese three advantages would warrant the system of summer pruning to be\r\ngenerally adopted. The valley has been unusually free from any insect\r\npest, such as leaf-hoppers (_Erythroneura comes_) caterpillars,\r\ngrasshoppers, etc., but suffers from mildew, not, however, to the extent\r\nthat the presence of almost daily fogs would lead us to suppose.\r\nSulphuring is now practiced to some extent, but not as much as it should\r\nbe. The sulphur is applied with bellows as soon as the berries are the\r\nsize of shot, but not before. Sulphuring for colure, or the dropping of\r\nthe grapes when very small, is not practiced, nor was it ever suspected\r\nthat it would help. Colure is quite common, much more so on sandy soil.\r\nSunscald is frequent but not bad. I saw quite a number of grapes scalded\r\non every vine, but not enough to warrant any special measures to be\r\ntaken as a protection. The grapes have during this and last year ripened\r\nby the first days of September, but it is generally much later, or at\r\nabout the 10th of September, when the vintage usually commences. The\r\npicking was, until last year, done by white labor, but the same was so\r\nvery difficult to obtain that Chinese were then employed. They gave\r\nsatisfaction to some, while to others not. Some of the principal growers\r\nare this year (1889) going to employ Chinese help at $1.25 per day, at\r\nwhich price they board themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Crop._--The grapes are dried on redwood trays made of sawed redwood\r\nshingles, three-eighths of an inch thick. The trays are made two by\r\nthree feet. The best growers are this year going to assort the grapes\r\nwhen putting them on the trays. This was never done before, but will be\r\nof great advantage. A tray will average eighteen pounds of fresh grapes,\r\nwhich will take about one month to dry,--never less than three weeks.\r\nThere is but little second crop, generally none that can be saved.\r\nSeptember is the warmest month, or else the grapes could not be dried.\r\nAt a temperature of 103 degrees Fahrenheit, it was found that grapes\r\nscalded or cooked while on the trays. This is, however, very rarely the\r\ncase. From ninety-five to one hundred degrees is considered the best\r\ntemperature at which the best raisins are made. The sweatboxes used\r\nformerly were two by three feet and ten inches deep; but of late eight\r\ninches and six inches in depth is considered the best, on account of the\r\nfacility with which they can be handled. As to packing, many advocate\r\ntwenty-pound boxes, that are only four and one-half inches deep,\r\ncontending that they will hold twenty pounds of loose raisins. Few\r\nDehesas are put up, the general brands being three crown London layers,\r\nand three crown loose Muscats. Some are also put up in fancy paper\r\nboxes. This year the valley has two packing companies, who buy raisins\r\nin sweatboxes, and pay from four to five and a half cents per pound. The\r\nyield per acre is from two to three tons of green grapes, I should say\r\nthis year nearer two than three tons. I saw, however, some that would\r\naverage five tons per acre, but this land was favorably situated in a\r\nmoister place than is generally found in Sweetwater valley, and the\r\nvines were yet growing on August 21st. I heard of much greater yields,\r\nso extraordinary indeed that they are not likely to return again. From\r\nfive to seven tons to the acre is a really rare yield, even on the best\r\nland, where the water is within six or seven feet of the surface. This\r\nshows me conclusively that judicious irrigation would materially\r\nincrease the crop, and greatly improve the uniform size of the berries.\r\nThe profit on an acre of bearing Muscat vines is from fifty to one\r\nhundred and twenty-five dollars per acre. The latter is the most any one\r\nrealized, and thirty-five dollars is considered a good profit. The\r\nexpense of running a vineyard is hard to ascertain, but those best\r\ninformed told me that forty dollars per acre would be an average; this\r\nof course includes everything. The small amount of weeds and the absence\r\nof irrigation materially lessens the expenses of the El Cajon vineyards.\r\n\r\nGood vineyard or raisin land can be had for seventy-five dollars per\r\nacre. No vineyards in bearing have changed hands. Last year’s (1888)\r\npack of the whole of San Diego county was variously estimated at from\r\ntwenty to thirty thousand boxes, and this year at sixty thousand boxes\r\nof twenty pounds each.\r\n\r\nThe unanimous verdict of the best growers in El Cajon is that want of\r\nmoisture is the greatest drawback to raisin culture there. And I agree\r\nwith them in this, but also think it might to some extent be remedied,\r\nas water for irrigation is close at hand. At last I must say a few words\r\nas to the quality of the El Cajon and Sweetwater valley raisins. They\r\nare very sweet, highly flavored, the skin is thin, and the seeds are\r\nsmall and few. But while some of the berries are of very large size,\r\nthere are comparatively few which would be considered large, and even\r\nthe best bunches have too many small berries. The grapes that had plenty\r\nof water were simply magnificent, and a general irrigation system would\r\ngreatly improve the size of the grapes, as well as the quality of the\r\ncrop. The best selected raisins from this valley must be counted as\r\namong the very best. The constant fog injures the bloom on the raisins\r\nto some extent, and most raisins that I saw were in this respect\r\ndeficient; but their color generally was very good. The Sweetwater\r\nvalley raisins are in this respect finer than those of El Cajon; they\r\nare also farther inland, and have less fog. The Escondido raisins are\r\nsaid to be superior, but I saw none of them. While many vines have been\r\nplanted in this locality of late, only one or two small vineyards are in\r\nbearing.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER RAISIN DISTRICTS.\r\n\r\nOf late raisin grapes have been planted in considerable quantities in\r\nSalt river valley and in Gila river valley in Arizona, but the outcome\r\nof the venture is yet unknown, at least to us. The growers of Arizona\r\nclaim for their localities the advantage of great earliness, as the\r\ngrapes ripen there in July, or a month earlier than in California.\r\n\r\nIn the Argentine Republic in South America it is said that the Spanish\r\nimmigrants have planted many raisin grapes during the last few years. In\r\nAustralia we are also informed that dipped raisins, and perhaps even\r\nsun-dried ones, have been produced, but even there the result is unknown\r\nto us. So far these raisins have cut no figure in the general market,\r\nbut it is not improbable that many localities in those vast countries\r\nwill be found where Muscat grapes can be profitably grown and cured.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCLIMATIC CONDITIONS, SOILS, LOCATION AND IRRIGATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLIMATIC CONDITIONS FAVORABLE AND UNFAVORABLE TO THE RAISIN INDUSTRY.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Limits of the Raisin Districts._--It is an interesting fact, and by no\r\nmeans a coincidence, that the raisin districts of the world are found on\r\nor between the same latitudes. Thus we find the California districts\r\nbetween latitudes 32°, 75´ and 38°, 75´. The latitude of Smyrna is 38°,\r\n28´, 7´´, that of Malaga in Spain 36°, 75´, Valencia 39°, 25´, Denia\r\n38°, 50´, the Grecian Islands and Morea 37° and 38°, and finally Huasco\r\nin Chile 28° south latitude. That the latter place is situated so much\r\nfarther south or so much nearer the equator cannot exactly be considered\r\nexceptional, as it conforms with the general characteristics of the\r\nSouthern hemispheres as compared with those on the northern half of the\r\nglobe. In Europe the Muscat grape for raisin purposes is not a success\r\nnorth of the fortieth degree of latitude. While the limits in California\r\nand Chile are not yet fully ascertained, it may be presumed that, as far\r\nas regards this country, these limits will not differ very much from\r\nthose of Spain and Asia Minor. Only years if not centuries of experience\r\nwill finally decide where and where not raisin grapes can be grown and\r\ncured to perfection. While the vines and the grapes can be grown in many\r\nplaces, the proper curing of the raisins is attended with more or less\r\ndifficulty in the various districts. With proper modes of curing the\r\ngrapes, and by protecting them from the inclemencies of the weather, the\r\nlimits of the successful raisin districts may be extended considerably\r\nboth north and south.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dry Seasons, Spring and Fall Rains._--The climate of the Mediterranean\r\nbasin, as well as of the raisin districts of the New World, present the\r\npeculiarity of having only two distinct seasons, one dry and warm, and\r\none cold and wet. There are other parts of the world also characterized\r\nby a dry and a wet season, for instance Mexico and Central America,\r\netc., but they differ in the important point, that whereas the climate\r\nof the raisin districts is dry during the growing or summer season,\r\nMexico has then its greatest rainfall. While grape-growing may not be\r\nimpossible under such circumstances, the curing and drying of raisins is\r\nimpossible, except with the aid of costly and burdensome appliances, the\r\nexpense of which will very much increase the cost of producing the\r\nraisins. The climate of the raisin centers is by no means uniform. As a\r\nrule, the farther north we go the less is the distinction between the\r\ndry and the wet season, the shorter is the former and the longer the\r\nseason of rain. Experience shows that the less this distinction between\r\nthe seasons is marked, and the shorter the rainless season, the less\r\nfavorable is the climate for the raisin industry. The longer the dry\r\nseason, and the less rain during the same, the more favorable is the\r\nlocality for raisin drying and curing, supposing, of course, other\r\nnecessary conditions are not absent. This absence of summer rains and\r\ncold fog is the most important climatic condition, and the one that more\r\nthan any other decides upon the advantages of any certain locality for\r\nthe industry under our consideration. A perusal of the reports from the\r\ndifferent raisin districts will convince us of this. For California we\r\nneed not refer to any special reports, as the newspapers are full of\r\nthem every year from May to November, and it will suffice to state that\r\nany large amount of rain after the beginning of June, and especially in\r\nSeptember, October and November, when the raisins are curing, is\r\nconsidered very detrimental, and sure to cause much loss. Heavy and\r\ncontinued rainfall during the drying season would not only injure the\r\nraisins, but might even totally ruin the crop. Any district where year\r\nafter year such showers occur, would not be considered favorable for the\r\nraisin industry, and would no doubt be given up to something else. To\r\nshow that these same conditions also exist in the Mediterranean raisin\r\ndistricts, we will here quote a few extracts from the United States\r\nconsular reports from there. Consul W. E. Stevens, United States consul\r\nat Smyrna, writes:[5] “It happens occasionally that rain falls during\r\nthe vintage time, causing heavy loss to growers through the inevitable\r\ndeterioration in quality. This was the case last season (1883), and\r\nlarge quantities of raisins were in consequence shipped to France to be\r\nmade into spirits.” From Valencia another consul writes: “In the event\r\nof wet and damp weather, the hurdles (or grape mats) are piled up in\r\nsheds covered with mats or painted canvas. Of course in this case the\r\ndrying is retarded, the quality of the fruit deteriorates, and the\r\nexpense and labor of curing are considerably increased.” Two years ago\r\nten thousand tons were thus damaged in the Denia district. While the\r\nMediterranean districts are comparatively rainless during the summer\r\ntime, still they are far less so than California. The rainy and dry\r\nseasons there are less distinct than with us.\r\n\r\n  [5] Consular Reports, No. 41½, June, 1884, page 745.\r\n\r\nAmong the Grecian Islands, the production of currants is confined to\r\nonly a few localities, principally on account of the untimely rainfall\r\non the other islands. Dr. Davy (_Ionian Islands_, page 320) tells us:\r\n“The attempts to extend the culture of the currant to some other islands\r\nhave been only partial, and attended with doubtful success. This, it is\r\nto be understood, is not owing, as has been asserted, to any unfitness\r\nof the soil on other islands, as it is analogous on them all, but rather\r\nto some difference of climate, especially about the times of ripening,\r\ngathering and drying of the fruit, consisting in greater liability to\r\nrain, a heavy fall of which is ruinous to the crop, and which, during\r\nthe period of gathering in the currant islands, is considered a great\r\ncalamity.” But even in Zante and Cephalonia in Greece, the crop is\r\nsometimes greatly injured on account of rain. Thus in 1857 a crop of\r\nfifty thousand tons was expected, but disastrous rains in August injured\r\nthe raisin grapes to such an extent that seventeen thousand tons were\r\ntotally destroyed, and twelve thousand tons became unfit for anything\r\nelse than distilling. Malaga in Spain, which of all the districts most\r\nresembles California, has undergone similar experiences, both damaging\r\nand ruinous.\r\n\r\nIt is thus that the fall rains are everywhere feared the most, the more\r\nso where they may be expected with regularity, and where the district is\r\nso situated that the heat of the sun is not powerful enough to rapidly\r\ndry the injured crop. Thus in Valencia the rains are feared more than at\r\nMalaga. In the latter place the sun is powerful enough to dry the\r\nraisins, and only repeated showers would injure the crop. Our experience\r\nis very much the same, and the early fall rains in the northern part of\r\nthe State are to be feared much more than rains at the same time farther\r\nsouth, where a few showers would soon be succeeded by warm weather, and\r\na hot sun powerful enough to dry the partially cured grapes. On account\r\nof local conditions, certain parts of Central California are freer from\r\nthese fall rains than the more southern districts, but this disadvantage\r\nis counteracted by the greater amount of warm weather and drying winds\r\njust at a time when they are most needed. But while the southern part of\r\nthe State is in this respect not as favorably situated as some other\r\nparts, the disadvantage is greatly counteracted by the warmer and drier\r\nfall weather in October and November, and by drying winds which are\r\noften able to desiccate the moistened raisins in a very few days.\r\n\r\nSpring rains in May or even in the early part of June cannot be\r\nconsidered greatly detrimental to the vines. On the contrary, if only\r\noccurring at long intervals, one or two showers say during the season,\r\nthey are rather beneficial than otherwise. In California I have never\r\nknown them to injure the crop, except if accompanied by heavy hail. Much\r\nalarm is regularly felt every time such a shower happens to come, but\r\nafter it is well over it will generally be found that the vines look\r\nfresher and better, the ozone and ammonia which was brought down by the\r\nrain having acted as powerful fertilizers for the grape-leaves, and\r\nincreased their vigor and growth. The only thing that might prove\r\ninjurious at this or any other time of the growing season would be\r\ncontinued cloudy weather before or after such showers, which would cause\r\nmildew. Such weather has to my knowledge never been experienced.\r\nOccasionally spring rains also bring frost, and this of course is one of\r\nthe greatest enemies of the raisin-vines.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Winter Rains._--In order that the raisin grapes may develop and mature\r\nwithout the aid of irrigation, the winter rains should be sufficient to\r\nkeep the soil moist during the dry months. The absolute quantity of rain\r\nthus necessary varies in different localities. In California, generally,\r\nwe would say that from twenty to twenty-four inches of rain would be\r\nrequired every year to keep the soil sufficiently moist to grow Muscatel\r\ngrapes without irrigation. The nearer we go to the coast the less\r\nrainfall is required to supply this moisture, and the farther we go\r\ninland, the more elevated the land, the less rain is needed. Thus a\r\nregular rainfall of twenty-four inches would possibly not suffice on the\r\nlow plains of the San Joaquin valley, while in El Cajon in San Diego\r\ncounty one-half of this rainfall is enough to grow the vines and mature\r\nsmall crops of very good and superior grapes.\r\n\r\nIt matters not from where the moisture comes,--from rain, seepage, moist\r\nair or irrigation,--as long as it is not present in excess nor too\r\nscant. In El Cajon valley the moisture appears to be held in suspense in\r\nimpervious strata, or perhaps in strata which contain and preserve the\r\nmoisture as does a sponge. In parts of Chile, as well as in Malaga and\r\nSmyrna, the winter rainfall is sufficient to grow crops of fair size and\r\ngood quality, but it is almost certain that judicious irrigation in any\r\nof these places proves beneficial and remunerative. Of all the present\r\nraisin districts, Smyrna enjoys the greatest rainfall, often as much as\r\nthirty odd inches of rain. Of localities which grow raisins profitably\r\nwith the least possible amount of rain, and without irrigation, Huasco\r\nand El Cajon take the lead. In Central California, as well as in San\r\nBernardino county, no raisin culture would be possible with the natural\r\nrainfall. In foreign countries, Valencia and the Grecian Islands, as\r\nwell as Morea, are similarly situated in not having sufficient rainfall\r\nto produce paying crops.\r\n\r\nAs a rule it may be said that, where the rainfall is sufficient to grow\r\nthe Muscats without irrigation and cause them to bear good crops, the\r\nfall rains are also too frequent and too injurious to the drying grapes\r\nto allow a profitable raisin cult. The proper amount of moisture\r\nnecessary to perfect the grapes cannot be ascertained by the aid of the\r\nrain gauge. While, as we have said, from twenty to thirty inches may be\r\nenough in Smyrna, from seven to ten inches suffice in El Cajon, and in\r\nChile even less is required. The proper amount of moisture can best be\r\ntold by the state of growth of the vines. The vines must have moisture\r\nenough to be kept growing up to the very time of the maturity of the\r\ngrapes. The proper sign of this is the green and fresh color of the\r\nyoung shoots or the tips, combined with a certain vigor of the tendrils.\r\nWhen the tips cease to grow, and the tendrils begin to dry up, then the\r\nmoisture has begun to give out, and irrigation should have been resorted\r\nto; the winter rains were not sufficient.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Frosts in Spring and Winter._--One of the frequent effects of spring\r\nshowers is spring frosts. They are always injurious to the tender Muscat\r\nvine, and if occurring more than once during the same spring may\r\nentirely ruin the crop. In California such frosts occur sometimes in\r\nApril, and observations inform us that they are most to be feared\r\nbetween the tenth and fifteenth of that month, while sometimes they come\r\neven later. The young buds are then either opening or fully developed\r\ninto shoots, which the lightest frost will blacken and cause to dry up.\r\nWhere the vines are irrigated and strong, one such frost may not ruin\r\nthe crop, as new buds will start out in place of the old ones destroyed,\r\nand new shoots and new blossoms will come out. I have seen as many as\r\nthree such crops of shoots develop from the winter buds, but each\r\nsucceeding crop of such shoots is weaker than the preceding one, and\r\nbears less and later grapes. Happily, these frosts occur but very seldom\r\nin the Central and Southern California raisin districts, and during\r\nfifteen years of observation I have seen only three such frost years in\r\nwhich the branches were partially injured. In neither of these seasons\r\nwas the crop materially injured as to quantity, the principal effect of\r\nthe frost being a retarding of the crop for a week or more. Smoking of\r\nvineyards can only be successfully carried out in small valleys\r\nsheltered from heavy winds, but on the open plains such smoking is\r\naccompanied with difficulties, and its effect is uncertain. The growing\r\nof a limited number of windbreaks has in the Fresno district no doubt\r\nmodified the climate, and made spring frosts rarer and less to be\r\nfeared.\r\n\r\nWhile the spring frosts are injurious to the grapes, winter frosts are\r\non the other hand most beneficial, if not necessary to a continued\r\nraisin cult. The raisin grape must have a season of recuperation, and\r\nwinter frost is the only climatic phenomenon which, without injury to\r\nthe vine, can procure it that rest which is so necessary for all\r\ndeciduous trees, by nature destined to enjoy alternate periods of growth\r\nand sleep. The absence of frost causes the sap of the vine to circulate\r\nmore or less in the wood, and the vine never ceases to grow. This is one\r\nof the reasons why our deciduous vines do not succeed well in the\r\ntropics, where there are no cold seasons to cause the leaves to fall and\r\nthe sap to become dormant. In the tropics, therefore, our deciduous\r\nvines keep on growing, set little or no fruit, and prove unprofitable.\r\nThis phenomenon is shared there with other trees, and peaches, pears and\r\napples act in the same manner. They all appear to need the rest afforded\r\nthem by the winter frosts. It is also a question of very great\r\nimportance, whether the continued and unnatural activity of the vine, at\r\na time when it should be dormant, does not invite diseases of various\r\nkinds, which find the exhausted vines unfit to withstand their ravages.\r\nIt may be possible that _mal nero_, the vine plague and other similar\r\nand as yet insufficiently understood diseases, are especially\r\ndestructive to vines growing in frost-free climates, while in colder\r\nclimates they make but little headway, the vines as it were being\r\nprotected by the heavy frosts, which either kill the enemies of the vine\r\nor enable the latter to gather the necessary strength to battle with\r\nthem through the growing season. There can be little doubt that at\r\npresent the healthiest vineyards are those growing in countries where\r\nwinter frosts are severe, but on the other hand we know that grapevines\r\nhave been growing for ages in temperate climates, where the frosts, even\r\nif not entirely unknown, are still of very rare occurrence.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Summer Temperature_.--The temperature in summer time must be sufficient\r\nto properly ripen the grapes, but must not be so great as to injure them\r\neither while they hang on the vines, or while they are exposed to dry on\r\nthe trays. The average heat required to do the work of maturing is not\r\nexactly known, but it is certain that a very high degree is not\r\nabsolutely needed to produce sweet grapes. As far as our experience\r\ngoes, it seems that cool weather, with the average temperature of ninety\r\ndegrees Fahrenheit, would be most beneficial in the fore part of the\r\nseason, while when the grapes begin to ripen a greater heat is\r\ndesirable. It is not the warmest countries nor the warmest seasons which\r\nproduce the earliest grapes. Thus while the season of 1888 was in\r\nCalifornia unusually cool, with the thermometer seldom reaching one\r\nhundred degrees in June and July, the raisin season was nevertheless a\r\nvery early one, and much earlier than seasons remarkable for their early\r\nhigh temperature. In Malaga and Smyrna, the heat seldom reaches one\r\nhundred degrees, and the grapes ripen several weeks earlier than in\r\nFresno, where the summer temperature averages ten degrees higher. In\r\nFresno, on the contrary, the season is earlier than in Southern\r\nCalifornia, where probably the seabreezes retard the ripening of the\r\ngrapes. A temperature of over one hundred and five degrees proves\r\ninjurious to unprotected or exposed grapes in the central region of\r\nCalifornia, but in San Diego county several degrees less is sufficient\r\nto scald the grapes or give them a cooked flavor if they are already\r\nexposed on the trays to dry. It is certain that with an average highest\r\ntemperature of ninety degrees, the grapes develop better and become\r\nlarger and sweeter than where the heat is excessive and reaches one\r\nhundred and ten degrees or more.[6]\r\n\r\n  [6] Whenever the temperature is referred to it means the degree of\r\n  heat (Fahrenheit) in the shade, and not in the sun except when so\r\n  expressly stated.\r\n\r\nThe time when the greatest temperature occurs is of practical\r\nimportance. Excessive heat can be tolerated by grapes protected by\r\nleaves and branches or otherwise sheltered, but if it happens at a time\r\nwhen the bunches are exposed to dry on the trays, the injury to the\r\nberries will be great or even ruinous. Early localities are especially\r\napt to suffer in this way, and it is well to experiment before too much\r\nconfidence is placed in very early regions. To such places, however,\r\nthere remains the possibility of curing the raisins in partial shade, as\r\nis done in Chile, thus producing raisins of an entirely different type\r\nfrom the Malaga or California product.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Winds, Injurious or Beneficial._--In the California raisin districts\r\nhot, electrical winds are much feared in the months of June and July, or\r\nbefore the grapes have begun to ripen. In the San Joaquin valley these\r\nwinds come from the northwest and sweep down over the vines, often\r\nscorching the leaves and frequently drying the berries on the exposed\r\nside. In the course of a few days the berries dry up entirely, and the\r\nwhole bunch is lost. These drying winds are not peculiar to any certain\r\npart of California, but occur from time to time in every raisin district\r\non the coast, in the south as well as in the center, on the coast as\r\nwell as inland. The remedy is to grow the vines low and to keep the\r\nberries well covered. The planting of windbreaks will also modify these\r\nwinds, and in places where they formerly were common they have now\r\nentirely ceased or become so modified that they cause no injury to the\r\ngrapes, but prove even beneficial on account of the quicker and better\r\nmaturing of the fruit. In certain districts, especially in San\r\nBernardino and in Orange, some very drying winds are experienced late in\r\nthe season,--in September and October. For the raisin-growers these\r\nwinds are a blessing. They quickly dry the exposed grapes, which have\r\nbeen retarded in drying, or perhaps even injured by a previous shower of\r\nrain or by continued heavy dews. These winds are undoubtedly desert\r\nwinds, and similar to the Terral of Malaga, which, sweeping over the\r\ninland plains of La Mancha, reach the coast vineyards and quickly mature\r\nthe grapes. In Malaga there is also a moist southern wind, the Levante,\r\nwhich retards the ripening and the curing of the grapes, and which must\r\nbe considered as our southwesterly fall winds, which, saturated with\r\nmoisture, swell the overdried raisins as well as prevent the yet green\r\ngrapes from drying. They are precursors of the rainy season, and warn\r\nthe grower to prepare his dryer if he possess one. In Greece and Smyrna\r\nsuch hot or moist winds are also known and feared, and cause at times\r\nmuch damage in one way or another. We might here also mention the cold\r\n“northers” which are common in the California raisin districts in\r\nspringtime, and which sometimes both cause the young shoots to break off\r\nfrom the old wood and make it easy for the mildew to attack the flowers\r\nor the young berries of the vines. Against these northwest winds we have\r\ntwo remedies, summer pruning and sulphuring, which, if applied in time,\r\nare both quite effective.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fogs and Moisture in the Air._--It is certain that the air in the\r\nCalifornia raisin districts is much drier than that of the Spanish or\r\nMediterranean districts generally. The night air is, in these districts,\r\nloaded with moisture, and dew is heavy and frequent, even in the middle\r\nof the summer. The air in Malaga and Smyrna feels quite moist, and\r\nwithout this moisture in the air the vines would grow less and require\r\nirrigation. In these places the raisin grapes grow on the steep\r\nhillsides without irrigation, but in California this could not be done\r\nanywhere except in El Cajon or in other parts of the San Diego district,\r\nwhere the air is considerably moister than elsewhere. This increased\r\nmoisture is partly caused by the increased rainfall in these districts,\r\nand partly by their nearness to the sea and fogs. This moisture in the\r\nair will, when other conditions are equal, greatly benefit the grapes,\r\ncausing them to grow larger, and the thickness of the skin is materially\r\ndiminished. Combined with this moisture in the air, fogs are injurious\r\nor indifferent. There is always a great difference between warm fogs and\r\ncold fogs, and now I speak principally of fogs from the ocean. Warm fogs\r\nare not particularly injurious to the grapes, generally indifferent and\r\nsometimes even considerable of a benefit to the proper development of\r\nthe grapes. In Malaga, San Diego and in Chile the Muscat grapes grow and\r\nthrive actually within the reach of the spray of the waves, and fogs are\r\nthere not uncommon, but they are warm. It would seem that such a climate\r\nwould cause mildew or oidium, but I cannot find that these fungi are\r\nparticularly frequent in San Diego county, while in Malaga they are but\r\nlittle more common than in the inland districts of our State. But as we\r\ngo north the cold fogs become more common, and the vines thrive less\r\nunder their influence. North of Los Angeles county the Muscat vines do\r\nnot enjoy the coast air, while even in Orange county the interior\r\nvineyards are preferred to those closer to the coast. But anywhere, even\r\nin the best situated districts, protection from the direct influence of\r\nthe sea fogs is appreciated, and the best localities are those in which\r\nlow hills afford this protection by modifying and increasing the\r\ntemperature of the fog or sea air.\r\n\r\nIn Central, and in the larger part of Southern, California, the inland\r\nvalleys are the most successful raisin-producing districts, while even\r\nin San Diego county, where the Muscats seem to thrive at the very\r\nseashore, the interior valleys alone afford the necessary heat and dry\r\nair for curing the grapes and transforming them into raisins. According\r\nto Consul G. H. Heap of Constantinople, the positions preferred for\r\nvineyards in Turkey are the slopes of elevated and sheltered undulating\r\nlands, or on the sunny hills that do not lie too near the coast, or are\r\nnaturally protected from the cold winds and fogs of the sea. The Island\r\nof Cos or Zea is called the paradise of the Sultana grape, because\r\nNature has given the cultivable land there the best possible protection\r\nfrom the direct influence of the fogs. In Malaga, according to Consul\r\nMarston, eighty per cent of the vineyards are situated on the hills and\r\ninland, ten per cent on the valley lands or plains, and ten per cent on\r\nthe coast. With the exception of some of the San Diego vineyards,\r\nCalifornia cannot show any raisin vineyards as close to the coast as\r\nthose found in Malaga. The main El Cajon vineyards are from ten to\r\nfifteen miles inland, while the former Santa Ana vineyards were situated\r\nfrom eight to twelve miles from the coast. The San Bernardino raisin\r\nvineyards are from twenty to thirty miles inland, while in the San\r\nJoaquin valley the raisin districts are more than a hundred miles from\r\nthe coast, while the sea wind, before it reaches any of the vines, has\r\nbeen modified by passing over from two to three hundred miles of dry\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ideal Conditions of Climate._--There remains only to draw some\r\nconclusions from the above facts. We are often asked what are the ideal\r\nconditions, as far as climate is concerned, for the proper development\r\nof the raisin grape, and for the proper curing of the raisins. Could we\r\nselect such an ideal spot, where all the requirements for the raisin\r\nindustry could be found in their highest perfection, with as few of the\r\ndrawbacks as possible, our choice would be as follows: A moderately dry\r\nair, a frostless spring, a rainy winter and a rainless autumn. The\r\ntemperature in the summer should vary between ninety and one hundred\r\ndegrees, the fall months should now and then be visited by drying winds,\r\nwhile the winter frosts should be heavy and regular, but not below\r\ntwelve degrees. Some have suggested that absolute freedom from any rain\r\nwould be very desirable, as then no interference would be experienced\r\nwith the cultivation of the grapes, but I doubt if the soil in such\r\ndistricts would not be rapidly exhausted through the want of weeds, the\r\nplowing under of which enriches the ground and enables it better to\r\npreserve the moisture provided for it by irrigation.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOILS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_General Remarks._--No one certain variety of soil can be said to be the\r\nbest for raisin purposes, and both in different countries, as well as in\r\nthe same district, various varieties of soils are valued equally. Every\r\nraisin district has, however, its favorite soil, which is supposed to\r\nhave some peculiar advantages for the raisin grapes, but upon closer\r\ninvestigation we generally find other varieties of soils which are not\r\ninferior. Growers who have succeeded with raisin grapes on one variety\r\nof soil are only too apt to consider this kind preferable to any other.\r\nThis is especially the case in California, where soils vary so much and\r\nwhere in some districts it is difficult to find forty acres with a\r\nuniform soil. Whether the soil is black, red or gray, it makes but very\r\nlittle difference, as long as it is rich and susceptible of the highest\r\nstate of cultivation and has the faculty of retaining moisture. The\r\ndeeper and richer the soil the better the Muscatel grape will thrive and\r\nproduce, and as such soils are most generally found along the banks of\r\ncreeks and rivers, or in their bottoms and sinks, we might conclude that\r\nin such localities the best soils for the Muscat grape may be found.\r\nOther varieties of raisin grapes, such as the Malaga (California) and\r\nthe Sultana, do well in less rich soil; indeed, they bear profitably in\r\nplaces where the Muscat would be a failure. It is therefore important\r\nfor every vineyardist to carefully select his soil and then plant on it\r\nthe proper variety of vine.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Malaga._--The soils of Malaga are of various kinds. The best is a\r\nreddish loam containing much gravel, both coarse and fine. This soil is\r\nvery stiff and hard, and when dry is as solid as a brick. The red color\r\nis derived from oxide of iron or other iron compounds, which many of the\r\nbest vineyardists consider a most desirable element in any raisin soil.\r\nThe upland vineyards, or those on the slope of the hills, contain soils\r\nof decomposed clay and slate mixed with more or less gravel and sand.\r\nThe Dehesa lands contain alluvial deposits of a black or gray color.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valencia and Denia._--In this district we find soils of many different\r\ngrades and colors. The sandy and gravelly soils are considered as\r\nproducing the finest flavored raisins, and those having the best keeping\r\nqualities, while the rich, loamy soils of the valleys produce raisins of\r\ninferior flavor and keeping qualities, but of larger size and more per\r\nacre. For economical reasons, the latter soils are preferred, as they\r\nalone can be irrigated and made to produce large crops. Some of the best\r\nvineyards in this district contain a gray, ashy soil, quite similar to\r\nthe white ash of the Kings river lands, while others are growing on a\r\nred clayey loam similar to the California red soil.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Smyrna._--The raisin-grapes of Smyrna in Asia Minor are almost\r\nexclusively grown on a white limestone soil, which consists of\r\ndecomposed white rocks mixed with a stiff ocher-colored loam. This soil\r\nis so rocky that it must first be cleared, and the large rocks are\r\ncarried away and used for boundary walls. This is the soil in the coast\r\ndistricts. In the interior the Sultana vines, as well as the Muscats,\r\nare replaced by fig orchards and other trees which delight in sandy\r\nsoil,--too sandy to produce profitable raisin crops.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Zante._--The soils of Zante, the home of the Currant grape, are of\r\nvarious kinds. The heavy marl of the plains, which contains a large\r\npercentage of gypsum or sulphate of lime, is considered the best; indeed\r\nthe gypsum is by many considered indispensable, or at least highly\r\nbeneficial, to the above variety of grape. Other soils are red clay,\r\ngray marl and gravelly loam, all containing an abundance of lime. The\r\nCurrant grape grows well and produces well on all these different soils,\r\nbut does the best on the gypsum soil, which is therefore the most\r\nvalued. On other soils the bunches are less solid, and the quantity of\r\ngrapes produced is somewhat less, while their quality is inferior.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Scene in a Fresno Raisin Vineyard: Raisin Trays Exposed\r\nfor Drying.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chile._--The Huasco grape grows in the valley of Huasco, on the coast\r\nof Chile, in a soil that is very light and red, containing a great\r\nquantity of sand. While very light in weight, this soil is said to be\r\nvery rich in plant food, and yields good crops.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fresno._--The Fresno soils are of several kinds, but the three\r\nprincipal varieties are red or chocolate-colored loam, white or gray\r\nashy soil, and a light, very sandy, loam. To this may be added the\r\ndeeper gray bottom soils or alluvial deposits of the Kings river. Each\r\none of these varieties have different grades more or less suitable to\r\nthe Muscatel grape. The best grades of each are equally valuable, while\r\nagain the poorer grades are not to be recommended. The deep\r\nchocolate-colored loam is by many preferred, and the largest and most\r\nsuccessful raisin vineyards are now located on this soil. But even in\r\nthe best districts the soil varies to such an extent, that while one\r\ntwenty-acre field will yield 250 boxes of raisins to the acre, the\r\nadjoining field, with only a slight change in the soil, will yield only\r\nseventy-five boxes to the acre. The best grades of the white ashy soil\r\nare also very good, and almost identical with the gray bottom-land\r\ndeposits of Kings river. The light sandy soil should be avoided for\r\nMuscat grapes, but may do for Malaga and Sultanas, especially if\r\njudiciously fertilized.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Other Soils in San Joaquin Valley._--In Merced the best soil is heavy\r\nchocolate-colored loam, in places redder, in others darker, almost\r\nblackish. It is generally mixed with some gravel. As a rule, all the red\r\nsoil in the San Joaquin valley is of the same characteristics, and well\r\nsuited to the Muscat grape, provided the ground is sufficiently level.\r\nIn Tulare county the proper soil for the Muscat is found to be the\r\nbottom lands of Kings and Kaweah rivers, as well as the deposits of the\r\nsmaller creeks. This variety of gray alluvial loam is exceedingly\r\nfertile, and there is none superior for the Muscat grape. But an\r\nadmixture of alkali often spoils soils which otherwise would be\r\nconsidered the very best. A similar soil is found in Kern county,\r\nespecially near Kern Lake, and which must be rated among the best in the\r\nState, its color being a deep bluish gray. The vineyards of Yolo and\r\nSolano counties are located on a very similar soil, rich in humus, lime\r\nand phosphates, but more yellowish or pale chocolate colored.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Orange County._--A similar rich alluvial deposit is found in Orange\r\ncounty in the fertile district known as Santa Ana valley. The soil\r\naround Anaheim, Santa Ana, Orange and Tustin consists of a more or less\r\ndark alluvial loam of unsurpassed fertility, and especially adapted to\r\nthe Muscat grape. It varies as to the percentage of sand and gravel. The\r\nsandiest soil in this district, while less rich, brings the earliest\r\ngrapes, which come to perfect ripeness several weeks before those grown\r\non the heavier soils, but the latter produce the best raisins.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Redlands and Riverside._--The Redlands soil of the mesa lands is\r\nreddish, rather darker than the same quality of soil in Riverside and\r\nFresno. It is mixed with sand and gravel, and partakes strongly of the\r\nnature of the red or chocolate-colored loams of the State. The Lugonia\r\nbottom soil consists of a very sandy loam, on which the Muscat grape\r\nhas proved a failure. The best Riverside soil is red or\r\nchocolate-colored sandy loam, so often spoken of. Towards Rincon we find\r\nalluvial bottom soils producing grapes of superb quality and size. The\r\nsoil of the San Bernardino district resemble the red Fresno soils, while\r\nthe white ashy soil is not found there.\r\n\r\n\r\n_El Cajon._--The El Cajon valley soils are of three or more kinds: Rich\r\nred clay mixed with gravel, with the color changing from lighter\r\nchocolate to deeper reddish. This is a very desirable soil,--a steel\r\ngray or slate gray adobe with much gravel of a coarse nature; a black\r\nadobe with some gravel; an alluvial sandy loam consisting of decomposed\r\ngranite mixed with much vegetable matter and humus. The El Cajon soils,\r\nwhile sandy and gravelly, produce exceedingly sweet and highly flavored\r\ngrapes but comparatively small crops.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Subsoils._--The subsoil in a raisin vineyard is of great importance.\r\nProperly irrigated soils, if they are sufficiently rich, need not\r\nnecessarily be very deep, as the raisin grapes, especially the Muscat,\r\nseldom extend deeper than eight feet below the surface. Even from four\r\nto five feet of rich soil may be considered as enough in irrigated\r\nvineyards, where the water is abundant. In poorer soils, or in districts\r\nwith less irrigation, the roots of the vines penetrate much deeper, and\r\nthe importance of the subsoil in such cases is apparent. Any rich\r\nsubsoil will serve our purpose. It is always best to thoroughly\r\ninvestigate the subsoil before the vineyard is planted, and in doing\r\nthis the following points must be considered: The subsoil should be as\r\nrich as possible, and there should, in no instance, be less than four\r\nfeet of rich top soil. _Very_ sandy soil or pure sand is not a proper\r\nsubsoil for raisin grapes. Such soil will cause the top soil to dry too\r\nquickly after each irrigation, and will cause the top soil to leach out,\r\nwhile it besides gives no nourishment to the vines. Hardpan is not\r\ndesirable, not even admissible, except in places that are or will become\r\nsubirrigated. Alkali or salty subsoils will soon spoil the quality of\r\neven the best top soil. This especially is the case in irrigated\r\ndistricts, where the salts of the subsoil are carried to the top by the\r\nrising waters or by the continued irrigation. Hardpan which readily\r\ndissolves when wet is not injurious.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hardpan Soils._--While I have alluded to them already, a few more\r\nremarks on these soils are here in place. The hardpan consists of a\r\nstratum of hard soil or hard rocky substance below the top soil. The\r\ndepth at which the hardpan is found varies. In places where it is\r\nsituated eight or ten feet below the top surface it does but very little\r\nharm, and may even prove beneficial in localities where water for\r\nirrigation is scarce, as it checks too rapid drainage. If the hardpan is\r\nsituated closer to the top soil, it may seriously interfere with the\r\nvines, and if too close, or say within two or three feet from the top,\r\nit makes such soils entirely unfit for raisin grapes. If situated\r\nsomewhat lower down, say from four to six feet, the hardpan does no\r\ngreat harm in subirrigated districts, while, in places where irrigation\r\nis not used, it leaves the top soil too shallow and too dry. But\r\nallowance must always be made as to the nature of the hardpan. Some\r\nvarieties of hardpan are so hard that they can best be compared to\r\nregular stratified rocks, impenetrable to the roots of the vines, and\r\nimpervious to water. Other hardpans again are softer, and allow the vine\r\nroots to penetrate more or less readily, while some again are so soft\r\nthat they dissolve in water and make good soil for the vines. If the\r\nhardpan is very shallow, it may pay to blast holes through it, in order\r\nto allow the roots of the vines to penetrate to lower soils. But if the\r\nhardpan is thick and hard, and if there is no immediate prospect of\r\nsubirrigation, it is better to use such land for some other purpose than\r\nfor raisin-vines, which will only pay properly if grown under the most\r\nfavorable circumstances, and on the best and deepest soils.\r\n\r\nAs to the nature of the hardpan, a few remarks may prove of interest.\r\nThe hardpan can best be compared to a stalactite formation similar to\r\nthose found in various caves. It has been formed very much in the same\r\nway as they were. In caves the rainwater, that seeps down from the top\r\nsurface, dissolves various substances, especially carbonates (and\r\nsilicates even) which again are deposited on the underside of the cave\r\nroof. This precipitation of hard material is caused both by evaporation\r\nof the water, as well as by attraction and adhesion. Such redeposition\r\nof dissolved minerals is seen for instance if solutions of salt in water\r\nare passed through tasteless and clean sand. The water will come through\r\nsweet and tasteless, the salt having adhered to the surface of the sand\r\ngrains. Similarly, if a hole is dug near the seashore in the sand, the\r\nsalt water will seep through, and form a well of more or less tasteless\r\ndrinking water. In the formation of hardpan, this is exactly what has\r\ntaken place. The rainwater has dissolved certain elements, such as\r\ncarbonates of lime, or carbonates of sodium and various other salts, and\r\nin its way through the lower strata of the soil these dissolved elements\r\nhave again been taken up by the sand and cemented it together. Thus it\r\nis explained why hardpan upon examination is so often found to resemble\r\nsand or sandstone: the lower sandy strata of the soil have been\r\nespecially effective in causing the lime in the water to adhere to the\r\nnumerous surfaces of every individual grain of sand. In hog-wallow\r\ndistricts the hardpan is found principally between the individual\r\nhog-wallows, but rarely in or under them. The rainwater has here carried\r\nthe minerals in the soil to the deeper places between the hog-wallows,\r\nin which it has accumulated to a greater extent than anywhere else, and\r\nthus formed a heavier hardpan. In flooding the hog-wallows, the top of\r\nevery hog-wallow is seen to settle and fall in, there being no hardpan\r\nbelow it, if the sides of the hog-wallow are steep. Where the hardpan\r\nconsists principally of lime compounds, its chemical composition is not\r\ndetrimental to the vines. But where the hardpan is cemented by alkalies\r\nmore or less soluble in water, these deleterious substances will\r\ndissolve and rise to the surface to the great detriment or even to the\r\ntotal destruction of the vineyard.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Comparative Value of Soils._--The river bottom soils, or soils formed\r\nby the deposit of creeks, are with few exceptions rich and deep, and\r\ncontain in abundance all the elements necessary to produce a superior\r\nMuscat grape. Such soils are, however, often injured by subsoils\r\ncontaining mineral deposits, which will injure the vines, or by\r\nhardpans, which will cause the soil to dry out. Poor soils will not\r\nprove profitable, and rather than plant vines on such soils it would be\r\nbetter to plant no vines at all. The rich soils are not only the\r\nheaviest producers, but the vines grown on them are stronger and\r\nhealthier and in every way better able to resist the attacks of insects\r\nand fungi and the ravages of other inexplicable diseases. But regardless\r\nof these advantages the various soils leave their effects on the grapes,\r\nsome of them producing sweet and very keeping raisins, while others\r\ncause large berries and bunches, which bring the highest market price.\r\nThus the lighter and drier soils produce richer flavored and sweeter\r\nraisins than the wet and rich soils, which again produce the largest and\r\nhandsomest grapes. On the latter soils the raisins when cured will be\r\nfound to be dark and covered with a heavy bloom, while the raisins from\r\nthe sandier or gravelly soils are lighter in color and with less\r\npronounced bloom. The keeping quality of the raisins from gravelly soils\r\nis well known. In California the keeping quality of the raisins is\r\nseldom inquired into, as our raisins keep remarkably well and are in\r\nthis respect superior to those grown in Spain. This may be from the\r\neffect of our drier climate more than from any certain quality in our\r\nsoils.\r\n\r\nAs a rule it may be said that poor soil causes the raisins to mature\r\nearlier than the rich, heavy loams, and on this account the latter are\r\nto be greatly preferred, as the earliest raisins in any district are\r\nnever as good as the bulk of the crop, and are in demand rather as a\r\ncuriosity, and for the purpose of supplying an early market, than\r\nthrough any superior qualities. In some districts there is such a great\r\ndifference in the time of ripening upon the various soils that the\r\ngrapes grown on the earliest soils are used only as table grapes fresh.\r\nIn planting a raisin vineyard, the future profits depend upon the choice\r\nof land, and it is far better to pay a high price for the best land than\r\nto take the inferior land as a gift. Few of those who now enter upon\r\nraisin culture take the proper care in selecting the land, neither do\r\nthey sufficiently, if at all, realize the advantages of the rich soil,\r\nnor the disadvantages of the poor land.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Alkali Soils._--While nothing but first-class land is to be recommended\r\nfor raisin vineyards, and alkali lands are of all soils those least\r\nsuitable for our purpose, still a consideration of these lands will\r\ninterest many raisin-grape growers. The best lands for raisin purposes\r\nin California are often contiguous to alkali lands, or to land\r\ncontaining more or less traces of alkali. A vineyard on the best soil\r\ncontains often spots charged with alkali, and it may be inconvenient for\r\nthe grower to allow these spots to lie idle, and he would prefer to fill\r\nthem up with vines. The first work must then be to get rid of the alkali\r\nor reduce it to such an extent that it will not prove injurious. The\r\ngeneral alkali lands are classed in three kinds, according to the\r\nquality of the alkali.\r\n\r\n1st. Alkali salts, such as carbonates and borates. These are greatly\r\ndetrimental to the vines, and no vines could be expected to do well in\r\nsuch soils, as even the smallest percentage of this alkali is injurious\r\nor even ruinous to the crop. In clayey soils these alkalies cause the\r\nclay to harden in such a way that no good tilth can be obtained. The\r\nland may be plowed ever so much, it will only turn up in chunks and\r\nnever become properly pulverized. These true alkali salts consist\r\nprincipally of carbonate of sodium (sal-soda) or of carbonate of\r\npotassium (saleratus). _Remedies_: Gypsum, land-plaster or leaching with\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n2d. A second class of alkalies are the sulphates and chlorides, all\r\nsoluble in water. Such salts are: Magnesium chloride (bittern),\r\nmagnesium sulphate (Epsom salt), calcium chloride, etc. These salts,\r\nwhen not present in too large quantities, are easily counteracted by\r\nlime.\r\n\r\n3d. A third class of alkalies is composed of neutral salts, such as\r\nchloride of sodium (common salt), sulphate of sodium (Glauber salt),\r\nsulphate of potassium, all soluble in water, but not convertible into\r\nless injurious substances by lime or gypsum. These salts do not bake the\r\nsoil, but rather contribute towards keeping it loose and mellow.\r\n\r\nThe remedies which are practical and not too expensive may be divided\r\ninto several classes, which, if used in combination, may prove\r\neffective, while each one of them used separately would fail.\r\n\r\n1st. Leaching with water. All soluble salts may be leached with water.\r\nThe alkali land should be checked and so ditched that the water from\r\neach check can be drained into a waste ditch. But, besides these waste\r\nditches, drain ditches should be made for the purpose of draining off\r\nthe water, say to a depth of four feet below the surface. The _modus\r\noperandi_ consists in first flooding the soil, and while the check is\r\nyet full the floodgates are opened and the water drawn off into the\r\nwaste ditch, when the water will carry off the salts which have been\r\ndissolved in it. A second or third flooding should be allowed to settle\r\nin the soil and be drained off below into the drain ditches. The\r\ndrawback to common leaching is that under certain circumstances the\r\nwater may deposit its alkali in lower strata, especially if they are\r\nsandy, and there form hardpan or alkali accumulations. A much better\r\nmethod is under-drainage by means of pipes or gravel drains constructed\r\nall through the tract at certain regular distances. This under-drainage,\r\nif properly constructed under conditions favorable for its perfect\r\nworking, is by far the best method of freeing alkali soils from their\r\nsuperfluous salts. To what extent this system is practical depends upon\r\ncircumstances. To reclaim large districts by this method may not prove\r\neconomical as long as good land is plentiful and cheap, but where\r\nsmaller alkali tracts are surrounded by soil, and where it is of\r\nimportance to get a uniform plantation, under-drainage by pipes or\r\ncommon drains is both the surest and most practical solution of the\r\nalkali problem. Under-drainage is strongly recommended by Prof. E. W.\r\nHilgard, who has repeatedly pointed out its value, and who has called\r\nthe author’s special attention to this as yet little understood remedy.\r\n\r\n2d. Deep and constant plowing. Deep and frequent plowing acts in various\r\nways. By being mixed with a larger quantity of soil, the alkali is\r\ndiluted sufficiently to not cause any serious injury to the crops, the\r\ndamage generally being done near the surface. Constant plowing also\r\nprevents evaporation, which carries the alkali to the surface and\r\ndeposits it there. This method can only be successful when the alkali\r\nsalts are limited in quantity, and no one need expect to be able to rid\r\nbadly charged lands from their alkali by plowing it under.\r\n\r\n3d. By plowing under green or dry crops. If grain can be made to grow on\r\nthe alkali land at all the turning under of it, either green or dry,\r\nwill in course of time greatly reduce the alkali. The turned-under\r\nstubble or straw forms in decaying an acid, which in many instances will\r\ncombine with and counteract the effects of the alkali. Similarly, straw\r\nstacks spread on alkali spots and plowed under will considerably reduce\r\nthe alkali. But manure containing ammonia and other salts should not be\r\nused, as it will, on the contrary, only increase the alkali by adding\r\nother or similar salts to those already in the soil.\r\n\r\n4th. Cropping. If water, either in the form of sufficient rain or as\r\nirrigation can be had, alkali lands can be reclaimed by cropping. It is\r\namply proved that beets and carrots, as well as other plants, such as\r\nsalt-bush (_Chenopodium_), take up large quantities of alkali salts, and\r\nin the course of a few years render alkali soils available for grain.\r\nWheat also extracts alkalies, and repeated croppings with grain will in\r\nthe course of time prepare the soil for vines and trees. Bermuda grass\r\nwill completely remove the alkali from soils to the depth at which the\r\nroots can penetrate, and must be recommended for the worst places.\r\nAfterwards, cropping with annual crops may be advisable before vines are\r\nfinally planted on such reclaimed lands. The Australian salt-bushes, or\r\n_Chenopodium_, extract alkalies, and are besides liked by stock. They\r\nshould be introduced to alkali lands and take the place of the\r\nCalifornia native salt-bushes, which are not eaten by stock. While being\r\nreal desert plants, they yet require some moisture in the soil, but they\r\ncould probably be grown anywhere on the alkali lands in this State where\r\nthe rainfall is over three or four inches.\r\n\r\n5th. By chemicals. The use of chemicals of various kinds in\r\ncounteracting the alkali is not resorted to by our farmers as it should\r\nbe. The principle upon which chemicals can be used is that obnoxious or\r\ngreatly injurious alkalies may be changed into less obnoxious and less\r\ninjurious salts, or even into fertilizers. The most available of these\r\nchemical compounds are gypsum (sulphate of lime) and lime (carbonate of\r\nlime). When the alkali consists mainly of carbonates, such as carbonate\r\nof sodium (sal-soda) or potassium carbonate (saleratus), in other words\r\nof the class which we have designated as class number one, the most\r\ndangerous and worst class of alkalies to combat, gypsum may be used as\r\nan antidote or rather as a means to convert these alkalies into alkalies\r\nof the second class, or the sulphates. The principle upon which this is\r\ndone is to displace the sulphate in the gypsum and force it to combine\r\nwith the alkali (sodium carbonate) and form sulphate of sodium (Glauber\r\nsalt), an alkali belonging to the third class of alkalies, and which is\r\ntwenty times less injurious to vegetation than is class number one. The\r\nchange is made on the following principle, and might be thus\r\nillustrated: To the alkali in the soil (carbonate of sodium), add\r\nsulphate of lime. As soon as the mixture is made with sufficient water,\r\na change will take place, and the substances (carbonate of sodium and\r\nsulphate of lime) will form new compounds. Thus we will get, out of\r\nthose two substances, two new compounds, _viz._, carbonate of lime and\r\nsulphate of sodium. Of these, carbonate of lime is not injurious to\r\nvegetable life, and sulphate of sodium (Glauber salt) is only injurious\r\nwhen present in large quantities. The carbonate of lime is not soluble\r\nin water, but the sulphate of sodium is, and can consequently be\r\neliminated by underdraining or by flooding, as we have previously\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\nTo know when gypsum can be used is not necessarily a scientific matter.\r\nMix some of the alkali in a tumbler with water, and allow the mixture to\r\nsettle. In another tumbler mix some gypsum and water, and allow it to\r\nsettle. Then mix the two clear liquids, which, if gypsum is an antidote\r\nand the proper thing to use, will be turbid or milky through the\r\nchemical combinations which take place. If the water remains clear,\r\ngypsum will not prove an antidote to the alkali under consideration. The\r\nuse of lime is based very much on the same principle. If the second\r\nclass of alkalies are present, and lime is added, the changes that take\r\nplace may be illustrated as follows: Epsom salt (magnesium sulphate)\r\ncombined with calcium carbonate, will form two new compounds, _viz._,\r\ngypsum (calcium sulphate) and magnesium carbonate, both of which\r\nsubstances are less injurious to crops. But, as I have already stated,\r\nraisin-vines prefer soils which are naturally free from alkali, and\r\nshould never be planted on soils which cannot readily be reclaimed.\r\nChemical antidotes may do where the alkali occurs in a few spots mixed\r\nin among tracts of good soil, but where the whole field must be\r\nreclaimed some other crop than vines had better be first attempted.\r\nThere is too much good and suitable soil in California, and until all\r\nthis is occupied the alkali soils had better be given up to other crops\r\nthan vines.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fertilizing._--To this date but few grape-growers manure their soil.\r\nCalifornia has not yet been engaged in the raisin business twenty years,\r\nand her vineyards are comparatively virgin. The first raisin vineyards\r\nwere planted on the deepest and richest soil, the soil which would\r\nnaturally hold out the longest, but the croppings of a raisin vineyard\r\nare enormous, and when from eight to ten tons of green grapes have been\r\ntaken from the soil year after year, it is but natural that the land\r\nshould become gradually exhausted. In Spain it is considered that even\r\nthe richest soils require manuring after ten years of constant cropping\r\nwith Muscats, and the same experience is likely to become ours in\r\nCalifornia. So far, I know of not one vineyard which has yielded Muscat\r\ngrapes for ten continuous years and still keeps yielding as much as\r\nformerly. Yearly the crop must become less, and finally will not be\r\nlarge enough to pay. The manuring of the Muscatel vines is fully\r\nunderstood in Spain, where all kinds of manures are used. When home\r\nmanures fail in supply, the Spaniards use imported fertilizers, such as\r\nMexican phosphates, etc. This fertilizer brings in Spain sixty-five\r\ndollars per ton, and is brought there from our very doors,--the Gulf of\r\nLower California. It could be laid down here for, and is actually sold\r\nhere now at, forty dollars per ton, or twenty-five dollars less than in\r\nSpain; still to my knowledge only very few raisin-growers in Fresno use\r\nit for their vines. In one year one of these succeeded, with the aid of\r\nthis phosphate, in raising the crop of an acre of Sultana grapes from a\r\nvery poor yield to over eight tons. The grapes were grown on a piece of\r\nsandy soil of the kind well known to Fresno vine-growers, and which is\r\ngenerally considered as less suited to raisins, lacking in fact in more\r\nthan one of the necessary qualities of a good raisin soil.\r\n\r\nIt is certainly a wrong policy to crop the soil until the grape crops\r\nbegin to fail. The soil will then be so exhausted of several of its\r\ningredients, that it will take the most scientific treatment to bring it\r\nback again to what it was formerly, and it is even questionable if this\r\ncould be done in a way that would prove profitable. Experience in Spain\r\nteaches that vineyards which formerly used to yield from eight to ten\r\ntons of green grapes to the acre now, after years of neglect, only yield\r\ntwo tons to the acre, and even with expensive manuring can in no way be\r\nbrought back to their former fertility. On the other hand, we know that\r\nvineyards which have been fertilized from the beginning have for fifty\r\nyears been kept up in apparently as good condition as at first; it is\r\naccordingly this method that must be recommended. The manure or\r\nfertilizer must be varied occasionally. In rotation, phosphates, bone\r\ndust, guano, stable manure, sheep manure, lime and plaster of Paris or\r\ngypsum may be used, but it is best to have every variety of soil in the\r\nvineyard analyzed, and to apply from year to year that kind of\r\nfertilizer which is particularly needed. The phosphates are those which\r\nwill first give out in our California soils. Phosphates must therefore\r\nbe considered as the best fertilizers we can use, but the quantity to be\r\nused must always be determined by a practical chemist. Of these chemical\r\nfertilizers, it is dangerous to use too much, as they might injure the\r\nvines, and from fifty to a few hundred pounds to the acre may in some\r\ninstances suffice and produce better crops than would four or five times\r\nas much. But, regardless of chemical fertilizers, the cautious\r\nraisin-grower should endeavor to return to the soil as much as he\r\npossibly can out of the wastes of his crop. The refuse of stems and\r\nberries, which are wasted at the stemmer and in the packing-house,\r\nshould not be burned, as is generally the case, but returned to the\r\nvineyard, and applied one year on one piece of ground, and another year\r\non some other piece. If, however, these wastes must be used as fuel in\r\nthe dryer, etc., the ashes should be carefully collected and spread over\r\nthe soil, and kept dry and shaded until thus used.\r\n\r\nAnother most valuable fertilizer generally wasted is the trimmings. In\r\nour careless California farming, these trimmings of the vines are put in\r\npiles on the roads, outside of the vineyards, and there burned. Thus the\r\nground loses the most powerful soluble salt, which would greatly\r\nincrease the yield of grapes and the profits to the farmer. Where the\r\nvines are planted far enough apart, the trimmings may be burned between\r\nthe rows of the vines without injury to them, but, when the vines are\r\nset close, there is no other way than to carefully collect the ashes and\r\nspread them evenly over the soil. Some vineyardists use large troughs\r\nmade of galvanized iron and perforated with holes. These vats are drawn\r\nthrough the vineyard by a team, and scatter the ashes evenly over the\r\nsoil. The vats may be so constructed that the cuttings are burned in\r\nthem directly as they are being pulled along, thus saving much labor as\r\nwell as ashes. Such contrivances will probably only prove profitable in\r\nlarge vineyards, where there are long rows and few turnings for the\r\nteams. Even the stable manure in our State is not used as it should be.\r\nIt is hardly possible to understand how vineyardists can be thoughtless\r\nenough to haul loads upon loads of stable manure on their roads or in\r\nholes and waste places, while their vines adjoining are suffering from\r\nthe want of sufficient nourishment. In the irrigated districts, this is\r\na very common sight, and the wet places on the road are often deep with\r\nmanure and strongly smelling of ammonia. If the manure had been placed\r\naround the vines, the increase in crops would probably have been\r\nsufficient to enable the owner to macadamize or otherwise permanently\r\nfix the roads.\r\n\r\n\r\nIRRIGATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Introductory Notes._--The irrigation of the raisin grapes was, for\r\nseveral years, considered as a practice entirely peculiar to California,\r\nbut as our knowledge extended it was found that, far from being anything\r\nat all new, it had been practiced successfully for centuries in some of\r\nthe Mediterranean countries. We have already mentioned how irrigation is\r\ncustomary both in the Valencia and Denia districts, as well as in\r\nGreece. It is evident that irrigation there is only limited by the\r\nsupply of water, and that there is no question about its usefulness. As\r\nregards the methods of irrigation in these foreign countries, we beg to\r\nrefer to the chapters treating of these countries. Here our efforts\r\nshall be to consider irrigation in its relation to the following points,\r\nwhich are of more general interest to the Californian growers: Necessity\r\nof irrigating the raisin-vines; the health of irrigated vines; the\r\nbearing quality of irrigated vines; the quality of the irrigated grape;\r\nsupposed unhealthiness of irrigated vineyards; irrigation by flooding;\r\nirrigation by furrowing; subirrigation; seepage; drainage; irrigation\r\nand its influence on the soil.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Necessity of Irrigating the Raisin-vines._--When the irrigation of\r\nraisin grapes was first attempted in Fresno and Riverside, hardly any\r\none was acquainted with or knew that irrigation had ever been used for\r\nsuch a purpose before, and irrigation was considered as a venture which\r\ndid not promise well for the future. Later on it was found that the\r\nraisin grape really would grow and do well in some localities without\r\nirrigation, and the latter practice was accordingly condemned. To-day,\r\nhowever, the practical knowledge of irrigation is greater and more\r\ngenerally distributed, and it is now fully understood that irrigation is\r\nnot only not injurious, but beneficial and necessary in localities where\r\nthe raisin-vine will not grow or bear sufficiently without it. The\r\nquestions then arose, When is irrigation necessary, and how much\r\nirrigation is required? The first object in raisin-growing is the\r\nprofit; a secondary object is how to so treat the vines that they will\r\nlast as long as possible. To attain the first object, we must raise\r\nplenty of grapes, and when a larger quantity of good raisin grapes can\r\nbe grown with irrigation than without it, irrigation is justifiable and\r\nnecessary. In Spain, especially in the Denia district, irrigation of the\r\nraisin grapes is practiced wherever water can be had, and the same is\r\nthe case in Greece and Italy.\r\n\r\nIn California the tendency is now to irrigate wherever water can be had,\r\nand wherever it is profitable to procure it. In Fresno, Tulare and Kern\r\ncounties, raisin grapes could not be grown without irrigation. These\r\nsame conditions are also found in San Bernardino county, while in Los\r\nAngeles and Orange counties all the best vineyards are irrigated, and\r\nonly occasionally do we find the conditions such that irrigation is not\r\nabsolutely necessary. In Northern California, raisin-vines may be grown\r\nwithout irrigation, but the latter is considered of such advantage that\r\nexpensive pumping works have been erected in places where no other means\r\nwere had for irrigating the vines. In San Diego county, especially in El\r\nCajon and Sweetwater valleys, irrigation is not absolutely necessary, in\r\nfact it is not practiced there at all, although water could be had, but\r\nas a consequence the crops there are not as large. In Smyrna, in Asia\r\nMinor, the largest raisin center in the world, the raisin-vines receive\r\nno irrigation, but the unusually heavy rainfall of this section makes\r\nthe want of irrigation less felt. Of course, outside of the raisin\r\ndistricts proper, Muscatels or other raisin-vines may be grown, and are\r\ngrown to good advantage without irrigation, but the climate in those\r\nplaces is generally unsuited to the drying of the grapes.\r\n\r\nShould we inquire into the reasons why raisin grapes may in some\r\nlocalities be grown and actually prove profitable without irrigation; we\r\nfind the same to depend not alone upon the rainfall of the locality, but\r\nprincipally upon such other circumstances as dew, fog, the nature of the\r\nsubsoil, and the moisture of the air. In Smyrna the rainfall of the wet\r\nseason is from twenty-four to thirty-six inches annually, and greater\r\nthan in any other raisin district. In El Cajon the rainfall is only half\r\nthat much, and the moisture in this case must be sought partly in the\r\nsubsoil, which is especially retentive of moisture, as well as in the\r\ndew, and the warm fogs from the ocean. The subsoil has the greatest\r\npossible influence, as in other valleys near by, where the fog and the\r\ndew are the same, but, where the subsoil is different, no raisin grapes\r\ncan be grown without irrigation. Malaga is in this respect very similar\r\nto El Cajon and Sweetwater valleys, but it enjoys more rainfall than the\r\nlatter places, while probably the dew and fog is about the same. Still\r\nin Malaga irrigation is used in a few isolated localities where it can\r\nbe obtained, the nature of that country being such, that no general\r\nirrigation system is possible, and this is probably, more than anything\r\nelse, the reason why the vines are not more generally irrigated there.\r\nIn Chile, in the valley of the Huasco, the Muscat vines are grown both\r\nwith and without irrigation, the conditions there appearing to be very\r\nsimilar to those of El Cajon valley in San Diego county. From the above\r\nwe might draw a general conclusion, that wherever the raisin-vines\r\ncannot grow without irrigation, and wherever water can be had in\r\nsufficient quantities, irrigation is practiced in order to increase the\r\ncrops and to make the business more profitable.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Health and Longevity of Irrigated Vines._--As regards the health of the\r\nvines, the old idea in this country that vines would suffer from\r\nirrigation is decidedly erroneous. The vines of Denia in Spain have been\r\nirrigated for eighty years or more, and are to-day the healthiest vines\r\nin Spain. Similarly, the Fresno vines, where the water level, as in\r\nDenia, is only from five to ten feet below the surface, show no signs of\r\ndecay, while many of the raisin-vines in other parts of the State,\r\nespecially where planted on the hillsides, show diseases which baffle\r\nthe cultivator. I do not, of course, mean to say that irrigated\r\nraisin-vines are entirely free from diseases, but only that, so far, the\r\nhealthiest and strongest raisin-vines of the world are those which are\r\nirrigated, and which have always been irrigated. Of course in this\r\nrespect the Muscat grapes, as well as the currant vines, differ\r\nmaterially from certain wine grapes, which as a rule have originated on\r\ndrier soils, and which, if grown with irrigation, deteriorate and yield\r\ninferior fruit. The raisin-vines require much moisture, and, if this is\r\nnot supplied in one way or another, they will suffer and prove\r\nunprofitable. The same is observed in soils which rapidly lose their\r\nmoisture. In such soils the Muscat is not at home, and its health and\r\nvigor is seriously impaired.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Bearing Quality of Irrigated Vines._--In regard to the bearing\r\nquality of the raisin grapes under irrigation, we know with certainty\r\nthat the irrigated raisin-vines yield by far the most. In Valencia and\r\nDenia, the vines yield from five to ten tons to the acre, and so do\r\nthose of Riverside and Fresno, while the El Cajon unirrigated vines\r\nyield only from one to two tons per acre. If the latter place would\r\nirrigate judiciously, its Muscat vines would no doubt bear as well as\r\nthose of any other locality. I am led to this belief from what I have\r\nseen of irrigated grapes elsewhere in San Diego county, which were fully\r\nas well loaded as the heaviest vines in San Bernardino county or Fresno.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Quality of Irrigated Grapes._--That the quality of the irrigated raisin\r\ngrape is increased by judicious irrigation is readily seen in all\r\nirrigated districts, where those vines which receive their proper share\r\nof water produce the largest bunches and berries. But it is also evident\r\nthat too much water will cause a deficiency of sugar in the grapes, as\r\nwell as a lack of flavor, by which the irrigated grapes can always be\r\ndistinguished from those grown with natural moisture. Grapes too freely\r\nirrigated are not alone wanting in sugar, but also in color. Such grapes\r\nremain green to the end of the season, and never assume that amber color\r\nso valued in grapes, and which always indicates beforehand what raisins\r\nthey will produce when properly dried. In our interior valleys, where\r\nthe sun and the wind sometimes produce sunscald of the berries, which\r\nagain causes them to fall off or dry up long before they are properly\r\nripe, this defect is much more frequent on vines which suffer from want\r\nof water than on those which have had enough. When the soil is not\r\nsubirrigated, it is therefore advisable to irrigate the vines at the end\r\nof June, just before the hottest part of the summer arrives. Similarly,\r\nirrigation will help to swell out the berries if applied just before\r\nthey commence to ripen.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion we might with truth say that the raisin grapes may in many\r\nlocalities be grown without irrigation, but that in California, in\r\nGreece and in Spain, the largest and most prosperous districts are those\r\nwhere the raisin-vines are liberally irrigated. The Muscat grape seems\r\nespecially to love water, and, in the real raisin districts, the\r\nhealthiest vineyards are those that are best irrigated. The berries and\r\nbunches are also increased in size, but not in flavor and aroma, by\r\nirrigation. In places where the raisin grapes will not bear without\r\nirrigation, the latter, of course, is a necessity. There are always\r\nnaturally subirrigated parts, in every county or district, where\r\nartificial irrigation is not required. But these parts are generally\r\nconfined to river bottoms or to natural sinks, which, so far, have\r\nplayed no important part in the raisin industry. Considered from a\r\npractical standpoint, irrigation of the raisin-vines is necessary in\r\nCalifornia, and, should it from some reason or other be made impossible,\r\nthe raisin industry would not prove profitable or even possible, except\r\nin a few very limited localities.\r\n\r\nMuch has been written in regard to the supposed unhealthiness of the\r\nirrigated vineyards. The malaria prevalent in some vineyards is no doubt\r\ncaused by irrigation; but it has been amply proved in Fresno and\r\nelsewhere that if the grower would know from the beginning how to so\r\nprepare his land that there would be no stagnant pools, no waste water,\r\nand no swampy grounds, the so much talked of malaria would be as rare in\r\nthe irrigated vineyards as anywhere else. It is not the irrigation that\r\ncauses malaria, but the waste of the water, the carelessness of the\r\nirrigator and the faultiness of the badly constructed irrigation works.\r\nAfter the vineyard has been irrigated a few years, the malaria leaves it\r\nentirely. This is the experience in Fresno where the vineyards, after\r\nyears of irrigation, have become perfectly healthy.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Various Methods of Irrigation._--There are several methods of\r\nirrigation now practiced in the irrigated vineyard districts. We may\r\nirrigate by flooding the land or by leading the water in furrows between\r\nthe vines. Both ways, but especially the former, may, if continued long\r\nenough, cause subirrigation, the most desirable state of irrigation. The\r\nchoice of methods of irrigating does not always lie with ourselves, but\r\ndepends upon the quantity of water at our command, the lay of the land,\r\netc. Sometimes one method will in course of time give room to another,\r\nand again, after the lapse of a few years, continued irrigation may not\r\nbe necessary or desirable.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Irrigation by Flooding._--This method consists of flooding the land\r\neither by means of checks and banks, which must have been constructed\r\nbefore the vines were planted, or in simply flooding ground which is\r\nnaturally level. In either case the land must naturally not be too\r\nrough, and the water must be abundant, else this method cannot be used.\r\nIt will always pay to engage the services of an engineer in preparing\r\nsuch ground for vines. The extra cost will be more than paid for in the\r\nfirst few years, when frequent irrigations of the vineyard are as\r\nnecessary as they are expensive. The ditch supplying the vineyard should\r\nalways run on the highest ground, and in no instance should it be run\r\nthrough low ground when high ground can be had, as the low ground may in\r\nthe future have to be used for drainage, about which we will treat\r\nfurther on. From the main canal, branch ditches should run out at right\r\nangles if possible, or if the ground is very uneven they may follow the\r\nhighest parts. The ground between these ditches should be properly\r\nleveled into checks. With checks the irrigator simply measures a piece\r\nof ground of any size which is surrounded by a levee or bank. This bank\r\nmust be high enough to allow the water to cover all of the ground as\r\nsoon as the check is filled with water from the ditch.\r\n\r\nTo make the ground level enough, it is generally necessary to level it\r\nwith scrapers. The more level is the surface the better, cheaper and\r\nquicker will be the irrigation, and no small amount of trouble will be\r\navoided if this work is properly done before the vines are planted. Too\r\nlittle of this leveling is done in some places, and I have seen\r\nthousands of acres planted in Muscat vines which were so improperly\r\nleveled that the profits of the vineyard in after years would be\r\nseriously interfered with. To understand how this can be possible, we\r\nmust remember what takes place when we irrigate and after we have\r\nirrigated. The gate in the ditch is opened, the water flows out and runs\r\nimmediately down to the lowest part of the check. When this part is\r\nreached, the check begins to fill up. If the ground is very uneven, it\r\nmay take days to fill the check, and the lower part will require to be\r\ncovered several feet with water before it will reach the higher parts,\r\nwhich always need irrigation the most. To back it up so high requires\r\nalso a correspondingly high levee, which again is more apt to break and\r\ncause trouble and expense the higher it is. After the water has reached\r\nthe highest possible point, the flow is shut off, and the water begins\r\nto subside. The highest part of the land becomes dry the first, and\r\nquickly, while it may take days or even weeks to dry up the lowest part\r\nof the check. When at last the check is all dry it may be found that the\r\nlowest vines have been injured or entirely drowned out. When summer\r\nirrigation is used, it is absolutely necessary to have the ground level,\r\nso that when it is flooded the water will not reach up to the grapes, as\r\nthey spoil when coming in contact with the water.\r\n\r\nThe time when flooding should be used must depend upon circumstances. As\r\na rule, flooding is especially adapted to winter irrigation, as, when\r\nthe vines are entirely dormant, they may be submerged for months without\r\nsuffering any harm. Young vineyards may also be flooded in summer time,\r\nbut, when the grapes begin to appear, flooding can only be done in the\r\nwinter or when the land is absolutely level, but even under the most\r\nfavorable circumstances many grapes are always lost. Some have so\r\nprepared their vineyards that a check, when flooded, can be drained into\r\na lower check or into a ditch. This is a very good arrangement where the\r\nland is not entirely level, as it will cause the low places to dry up as\r\nquickly as possible. But a better way is to have the ground so level\r\nthat the water will sink evenly and leave no sinks nor any high and\r\nprematurely dry places. There are, however, soils so composed that the\r\nwater cannot sink through them in any reasonably short time. Such heavy\r\nsoils must be surface drained after every flooding, or perhaps had best\r\nbe given up to some other method of irrigation. But such hard or\r\nimpervious soils are frequently improved by irrigation, and in course\r\nof time lose their impervious nature and become subirrigated. If the\r\nland is tolerably level by nature, and there are prospects of\r\nsubirrigation soon appearing, it may be unnecessary to level the land,\r\nand flooding with temporary checks may be used with advantage for the\r\nfirst few seasons. Furrowing will generally assist this mode of\r\nirrigation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Irrigation by Furrowing._--This method of irrigation is practiced where\r\nthe land is not sufficiently level to be flooded, or when the water is\r\nnot sufficient to enable the irrigator in a short time to flood the\r\nland. The practice of furrowing simply consists in plowing furrows\r\nalongside of the vines, and then to lead the water in the furrows. This\r\nsystem is by far the one that is most practiced in Southern California,\r\nas it has some advantages over the flooding; it is, however, not so\r\neffective and cannot supply the vineyard with as much water as flooding.\r\nTo use the furrowing system to advantage, the land must have been\r\npreviously leveled, but not necessarily graded to an absolute level. It\r\nis enough to have the surface smooth and on an even grade, in order that\r\nthe water may run from a higher point to a lower one without spreading\r\nor breaking out. Especially all knolls in the vineyard must be leveled\r\noff, and care must be taken to fill all hollows or sinks in which the\r\nwater would otherwise collect.\r\n\r\nAfter the vines are planted, or when irrigation is necessary, one or\r\nmore furrows are plowed on each side of the vine, and the water is\r\nallowed to run in them for several hours, or even days, until the soil\r\nis sufficiently soaked. In many places three furrows are made between\r\nthe rows of vines, and the water is allowed to run in at one end and out\r\nthrough the other in a stream only sufficiently large to cause all the\r\nwater to sink. Where particular nicety is required, the waste water\r\nwhich runs out at the farther end may be collected in a trough with\r\nperforated holes, through which it is conducted to a ditch or lower\r\ncheck. Similarly, a long trough may be used for conducting the water to\r\nthe land in the first instance, and allow it to run out through a number\r\nof small holes, one of which is situated in front of every furrow. When\r\nthe ground is well prepared, level and with an even slope, this system\r\nof irrigation is very perfect, and causes but little expense and trouble\r\nin management. In Riverside the vines are irrigated thus every three or\r\nfive weeks, while in Redlands less irrigation is used on old vines. As a\r\nrule, in Southern California the furrowing system is the accepted one as\r\nbeing best adapted to the nature of the country. The water is conducted\r\nboth in open ditches and in pipes, and when under pressure saves much\r\nlabor and expense which would otherwise be required for the continued\r\nconstruction and repair of ditches.\r\n\r\nThe furrowing system has, however, its disadvantages. It requires a\r\nlonger time to fill the soil sufficiently, and accordingly it takes many\r\nmore irrigations to accomplish as much as with flooding. As advantages\r\nof this system, we might state that it requires no banks or levees to\r\nback up the water, and a vineyard irrigated this way can be kept\r\nentirely free from weeds by a few cultivations, while a checked vineyard\r\nmust besides be cleared with hand labor, as the banks and checks are apt\r\nto be destroyed by cultivation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Subirrigation._--Subirrigation may be either artificial or natural. The\r\nartificial subirrigation has, as far as I know, only been used in a few\r\nvineyards in Yolo and Solano counties, the report, shortly after it had\r\nbeen established, being very flattering as regards its success. But of\r\nlate years we have heard nothing about this kind of irrigation, and it\r\nis likely that some practical difficulty was encountered which could not\r\nbe fully overcome. The artificial subirrigation consists in laying\r\nlarger and smaller cement pipes between the rows of the vines. These\r\npipes are perforated in various places, and, when filled with water\r\nunder pressure, the water runs through the perforated holes and keeps\r\nthe ground outside the pipes constantly moist, without causing the\r\nsurface of the soil to get wet and weedy, and herein consist the\r\nprincipal advantages of the system, as well as in the fact that rolling\r\nground can be irrigated thus without being previously leveled and\r\nwithout being cut up with open ditches. The difficulty of keeping the\r\nholes open and of preventing the roots of the vines from entering the\r\npipes is, I understand, very great and probably impossible to overcome.\r\nBoth irrigation water and liquid manures could by this system be\r\nsupplied to the roots of the vines directly without any waste, and, in\r\ncases of diseases or attacks by underground pests, medicines or\r\ninsecticides could be brought to the soil with the least possible cost.\r\n\r\nThe natural subirrigation is caused either by the whole soil filling up\r\nwith water from the natural and original water level to the very top or\r\nto the roots of the vines, or from an impervious hardpan or clay, as\r\nsubsoil, up towards the surface. As an example of the former we might\r\ncite the country around the irrigated plains of the San Joaquin valley,\r\nespecially around Fresno and in Mussel Slough. Before irrigation was\r\nbegun there in 1872, the surface water was from sixty to seventy feet\r\nfrom the top east of the railroad, and from forty to fifty feet west of\r\nthe railroad, lower down in the valley. After five years of irrigation\r\nit began to be noticed that the soil required less water. The water in\r\nthe wells began to rise, and the following year the water stood in many\r\nplaces near or on the top of the surface. Now the whole irrigated\r\ndistrict around Fresno has filled up with water to such an extent that\r\ndrainage ditches have become necessary in some places in order to lower\r\nthe water in the wet season some four or five feet from the surface.\r\nMany more drainage ditches will be required, as in wet winters the\r\nsurface water in places is not only very near the top, but actually\r\nforms ponds or swamps where formerly the ground was entirely dry.\r\n\r\nIn the old irrigated districts, water can now be found at from six to\r\nten feet in the driest season, while formerly the wells had to be from\r\nfifty to seventy feet deep. In the older vineyards, and even in many of\r\nthe younger ones, no more surface irrigation is used; all that is now\r\nrequired is to allow the water to run in the main ditches, in which the\r\nwater sinks sufficiently to keep up the supply of the evaporation of the\r\nground outside. Large tracts of land which have never been surface\r\nirrigated are now sufficiently moist to grow vines to the greatest\r\nperfection, and many of the best vineyards have never been irrigated at\r\nall; in fact, nothing but drainage ditches have ever been made on the\r\nland. Whenever such subirrigation exists, the water level will be found\r\nhigher in the winter than in the summer, and drainage should accompany\r\nsubirrigation in nearly every instance. A subirrigation like the above\r\nexists in Denia and other of the Spanish districts. Subirrigation may be\r\nalso caused by either impervious subsoils, such as hardpan and clay, or\r\nby spongy subsoils, which keep the water like a sponge. Such is the case\r\nto a limited extent in parts of San Bernardino county. At Redlands, for\r\ninstance, much less irrigation is now used than when the vines were\r\nfirst planted, and this fact is attributed to a spongy subsoil\r\npeculiarly retentive of water. A similar subirrigation exists in the\r\nMussel Slough country, where the water rapidly fills the land and keeps\r\nit moist throughout the summer. The phenomenal moisture of the El Cajon\r\nland is probably also produced by some kind of subirrigation, either on\r\nimpervious or through retentive strata; the waste water from the\r\nsurrounding hills no doubt supplies much of the water appearing in the\r\nlower lands of the valley. Other valleys close by do not show this\r\nmoisture, the underlying strata probably making subirrigation impossible\r\nwith the present amount of rainfall.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Seepage._--Seepage is the quality of the soil to attract moisture and\r\nretain it. Seepage soils attract the water from a ditch run through the\r\nland, the water spreading all through the soil towards all sides instead\r\nof sinking only vertically down. There is a distinct difference between\r\nsuch seepage soils and those that do not seep, although there is a\r\ngradation in the degree of the seepage, some soils seeping more than\r\nothers. Thus the Fresno soil, or the soils on the Fresno plains,\r\nespecially the red and sandy soils, do not seep or percolate. Vines\r\nplanted on the sides of the ditches, or a foot or two from their banks,\r\nwill die and dry up if not specially irrigated by bringing water to\r\ntheir very roots. Other soils, especially the river-bottom soils or the\r\nalluvial soils, seep or percolate in a great or less degree. They act\r\nlike a sponge, attract water and give it away slowly, and the soil will\r\nbe found wet for long distances from the ditch. This seepage capacity of\r\nthe soil is partly caused by an abundance of humus or vegetable matter.\r\nThe seepage capacity of the soil greatly increases by admixtures of\r\ngreen vegetable matters through the plowing under of green crops, such\r\nas alfalfa, peas, beans, grain, etc. The value of seepage soils is seen\r\nespecially where some uneven ground is scraped off and the top soil\r\nremoved to low places. Such ground often becomes useless for years\r\nafterwards, especially if the quantity of humus in the lower soils is\r\nsmall. Frequent irrigations will not serve to keep such soils moist, as\r\nthe water sinks rapidly down, leaving the poor top soil dry. Vines\r\nplanted in such places never do well, and even heavy manuring will not\r\nsuffice to bring on a strong, healthy growth. Such humus-wanting soils\r\nmust be treated with green crops, as stated above, in order to become\r\nfertile and moist. Thus seepage and subirrigation are often confounded.\r\nThe former is caused by the retentive and communicative quality of the\r\nsoil, while the latter is caused by the natural or artificial\r\ndistribution of the underground water.\r\n\r\nSubirrigation and seepage combined make the most perfect irrigation for\r\na raisin vineyard, with advantages that can in no other way be attained:\r\nabsence of distribution ditches, which take up valuable land and which\r\ncost money to keep clean from weeds; less growth of weeds on the surface\r\nof the ground; greater mellowness of the top soil and less work in\r\nplowing generally; a greater and more uniform supply of moisture, which,\r\ninstead of being near the top of the ground, is accumulated deeper down,\r\nthus causing the roots to go down instead of spreading near the surface;\r\nno expensive irrigation, which will require plowing every time after the\r\nwater is spread on the surface; a greater coolness of the ground and a\r\nlower temperature generally, which shows itself in a more vigorous\r\ngrowth of the vines, a greater supply of grapes and less danger from\r\nsunburn. These and many more are the advantages of subirrigation and\r\nseepage combined. To attain them in a raisin vineyard, no labor and\r\nreasonable cost should be spared.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Raisin-grape Picking at Riverside.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Drainage._--Drainage is necessary in all vineyards where large\r\nquantities of water are used for irrigation, and principally at the very\r\ntime that subirrigation begins. Thus in Fresno county the best raisin\r\nvineyards are those in which the land is both subirrigated and drained.\r\nWhen irrigation commences in any certain district, no one thinks of\r\ndrainage as a possibility, and great carelessness is shown in locating\r\nditches and other irrigation works. But in a few years, when the soil is\r\nfull of water which finds no outlet, drainage becomes both necessary and\r\ndesirable. A very successful and highly necessary drain has been\r\nconstructed through a part of the Fresno district, which so filled up\r\nwith water during the rainy winter of 1883-84 that much of the ground\r\ncould not be plowed until late in the spring. The drain remedied the\r\nevil and drained the soil, and the vineyards grown there are now counted\r\namong the best and most profitable. The water thus drained off lowered\r\nthe water level from six to seven feet. In very dry seasons this ditch\r\nis filled with water, and serves then to keep the soil moist through\r\nseepage or subirrigation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Influence of Irrigation on the Soil._--It is by many considered\r\nthat irrigation helps to fertilize the soil. The spring and flood water\r\ncontain great quantities of mud and humus, which when spread over the\r\nland will greatly increase its fertility. Even ordinary river water\r\ncontains salts and other ingredients, which will fertilize the soil to\r\nno small degree. Another cause of the increased fertility of\r\nsubirrigated soils is that the water which constantly evaporates carries\r\nwith it salts, etc., from the lower strata up towards the surface, and\r\nmakes them accessible to the roots of the vines. But, on the other hand,\r\nif the water or the soils contain alkalies or other destructive\r\nsubstances, these also are deposited on the surface to the great\r\ndetriment of the vines, and often to such an extent that the vines will\r\ndie or become sickly. Too abundant flooding may also leach out of the\r\nsoil its soluble salts, and carry them deeper down in the ground. But if\r\nthis soil after a while fills up with water and becomes subirrigated,\r\nthe evaporation of water from the surface will gradually carry these\r\nsalts back to the surface, when they will increase the fertility of the\r\nsoil. Where drainage is very perfect, constant irrigation will gradually\r\nrob the soil of many of its soluble salts, and carry them to places\r\nwhere they will forever be out of the reach of the vines. To ascertain\r\nthese facts and conditions, every vineyardist should have the soil\r\nanalyzed about every five years, and too great care cannot be taken to\r\nkeep the soil of proper strength.\r\n\r\nAnother influence of irrigation on the soil may also be mentioned here.\r\nSome of the soils in the irrigated districts which were formerly very\r\nhard and difficult to work have in course of time changed and become\r\nmellow. The water has undoubtedly caused a chemical and mechanical\r\ndecomposition of the components of the soil, which has caused it to\r\ncontinually improve. Even certain kinds of hardpan have been known to\r\ndissolve when irrigated, and to change into useful and mellow soil, in\r\nwhich the vines can find nutriment. Such hardpans are those which are\r\ngenerally found in very dark red soils; those in lighter soils are not\r\nso readily dissolved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RAISIN GRAPES.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Introductory Notes._--The raisin grapes might be divided into two\r\nclasses,--proper and genuine, such as Muscats, Sultanas and Currants,\r\nand irregular or inferior raisin grapes, such as Malagas and Feher\r\nSzagos. Now-a-days almost any kind of grapes are dried and sometimes\r\ncalled raisins, but the proper name for them should be dried grapes.\r\nWith these we need not here busy ourselves, as with a few exceptions\r\nthey are of little value, and cannot be compared with the regular raisin\r\ngrapes, either as regards quality, demand or price.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Muscatel or Gordo Blanco._--This variety is the best type of the raisin\r\ngrape of Malaga. Its growth is low and spreading, with no upright\r\nbranches in the center. Its bunches are heavy, and, when perfect, close\r\nand shouldered. Its berries are round and large, the greatest\r\ncircumference being at the center. A crease is often found at the apex\r\nof the berry. The color is green, or, when fully ripe, amber green or\r\nyellow. As compared with the Muscat of Alexandria, this variety is\r\ndistinguished, when perfect, by its low, depressed growth, without any\r\nupright branches in the center of the vine; by a closer bunch; by\r\nrounder berries, and by a thicker and firmer bloom. The berries set\r\nbetter than those of the Muscat of Alexandria, although both varieties\r\nsuffer from the early stages of oidium or colure. The Gordo Blanco is\r\nthe choice raisin grape for the San Joaquin valley, and for the interior\r\ngenerally. It is the raisin grape of Malaga in Spain, where it is\r\nprobable the variety originated. Importations of this variety have been\r\nmade to California at various times by A. Haraszthy in 1861, and by W.\r\nS. Chapman in 1876.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Muscat of Alexandria._--The growth of this variety is upright in the\r\ncenter. Its clusters, even when perfect, are never close. Its berries\r\nare oblong and tapering, the largest circumference being near the apex.\r\nThe color when fully ripe is amber green or yellowish green. The leaves\r\nof both varieties of Muscats are five-pointed, light green, lighter\r\nbelow, and do not differ materially from each other. Both Muscats are\r\nremarkable for their second and third growths, and for the large second\r\ncrop on the laterals.\r\n\r\nThe Muscat of Alexandria, as compared with the Gordo Blanco, is\r\ncharacterized by its oblong berries, and by its more upright branches in\r\nthe center of the vine. Its growth is more straggling than that of the\r\nGordo Blanco, and, planted side by side, the two varieties are\r\ndistinctly characteristic. The Muscat of Alexandria is the favorite\r\nraisin grape in Southern California, where it seems eminently adapted. I\r\nfound no other Muscat in San Bernardino and San Diego counties. The most\r\nmagnificent bunches of this variety which I have ever seen were grown\r\nthere only a few miles from the ocean,--bunches that could not be\r\nsurpassed, and which certainly were equal in weight to any Gordo Blanco\r\nthat have ever come under my notice. A. B. Butler considers that the\r\nMuscat of Alexandria does equally as well as the Gordo Blanco in Fresno,\r\nbut most growers are not ready to agree with him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 2.--Planting Bar (Fresno). 3.--Fresno “Sheep’s-foot.”\r\n4.--Muscat of Alexandria (N. S.). 5.--Muscatel Gordo Blanco.]\r\n\r\nThe raisin made from the Muscat of Alexandria looks smaller on account\r\nof its oblong form, and is less suited for facing the boxes, but as to\r\nother qualities, such as taste, sweetness and color, there is no marked\r\ndifference between these two varieties of Muscats. All varieties of\r\nMuscats set better in moist air than where the air is very dry, and the\r\nmoister air tends to better develop the bunches. This explains why, in\r\nisolated vineyards in the interior, the bunches are never so large as\r\nwhere a large number of acres of vines have modified the often excessive\r\ndryness of the atmosphere. As to the relative distribution of these two\r\nvarieties of Muscats in our State, it may be stated that the former is\r\nnot based upon any particular adaptability of the respective varieties\r\nto the localities where they are grown. The Muscat of Alexandria is the\r\nolder variety of the two, probably both in Spain as well as in\r\nCalifornia. To Valencia in Spain it was brought by the Moors from\r\nAfrica, or possibly from Alexandria in Egypt. The Gordo Blanco again\r\nappears to be a native Spanish variety, especially adapted to the warmer\r\nregion of Malaga or Southern Spain. The Gordo Blanco is the principal\r\ngrape of Malaga; the Muscat of Alexandria is the one grown in Valencia\r\nand Denia and also in Smyrna in Asia Minor.\r\n\r\nIn California the Gordo Blanco is found around Woodland in Yolo county,\r\nthroughout the San Joaquin valley, and in Fresno it is the favorite and\r\nalmost exclusive Muscat grape. The Muscat of Alexandria is grown in\r\nSolano county and elsewhere in Northern California, while it is the\r\nexclusive grape in Riverside, Redlands, Orange county and El Cajon, and\r\nprobably elsewhere in San Diego county or Southern California generally.\r\nThe Muscat of Alexandria was imported by Colonel Agoston Haraszthy in\r\n1852 from Malaga, and by D. M. Delmas some thirty-eight years ago from\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Huasco Muscat._--This variety (pronounced Uasco) resembles very much\r\nthe Muscat of Alexandria, of which it is probably a seedling, and was\r\nintroduced into Chile by the Spaniards soon after the conquest.\r\nAccording to Professor E. W. Hilgard, this variety sets better than the\r\nAlexandria, and on that account deserves to be cultivated. It is strange\r\nthat no attempts have been made in this country to grow it on a larger\r\nscale. The Huasco is undoubtedly one of the most interesting grapes, and\r\nthe fact that it produces the most expensive raisins in the world should\r\nbe a sufficient inducement to our California growers to at least study\r\nthe variety closely. I should think that El Cajon valley would be the\r\nproper locality for it in this State.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Other Varieties of Muscats._--A variety of Muscatel resembling the\r\nGordo Blanco, but with more erect growth, is said to have been imported\r\nby G. G. Briggs of Davisville, Solano county. I have seen it growing in\r\nthe vineyard of George A. Freeman of Fresno, but cannot distinguish its\r\nberries from those of the Gordo Blanco. The growth of the vine is more\r\nerect, and leaves the center of the vine rather uncovered and exposed. I\r\nwould decidedly prefer the Gordo Blanco. A seedling of the Gordo Blanco\r\noriginated by the author is now growing on the Floreal vineyard, owned\r\nby J. T. Goodman, near Fresno. This variety promised a great deal the\r\nfirst season. I have no doubt that, with some selection of berries and\r\nbunches, many new and valuable raisin grapes could be originated in this\r\nState, varieties which would be especially adapted to our soil and\r\nclimate. While our fruit-growers have produced a number of new fruits of\r\nvarious kinds, we have yet to hear of the first superior grape\r\nseedlings. According to the _Rural Press_ of May 5, 1877, C. T. Ward of\r\nHaywards, Alameda county, raised some seedlings from Huasco seed, but\r\nwhat has become of them I do not know. Haywards would not be likely to\r\nbe a proper place for raisin grapes, and even the best variety could not\r\npossibly be a success there.\r\n\r\nJ. T. Goodman of Fresno has a Muscatel vine in his vineyard which ripens\r\nten days earlier than the Gordo Blanco, but whether it is a seedling is\r\nnot known. It may prove a most valuable variety if extensively grown. B.\r\nG. Stabler of Yuba City tells me that Ch. E. Swezy, near Marysville,\r\nhas raised a seedling from an imported Dehesa raisin, which in size,\r\nflavor and all other qualities excels any other table grape known, but\r\nthe flavor of the grape does not resemble that of the Muscatel. I have\r\nseen raisins made from this grape, but they were not desirable; but as a\r\ntable grape this variety is said to be superior. If so, this grape\r\nshould be tried in different localities, and may prove a real\r\nacquisition. There is no doubt that other seedling raisin grapes have\r\nbeen raised in this State, and we hope in course of time to know all\r\nabout them.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Seedless Sultana._--This grape is decidedly one of the most important\r\nraisin grapes known. Its bunches are very large, sometimes weighing five\r\npounds each. The berries are round and seedless, the size of large peas,\r\nof a green color, which, when the grape ripens, turns bright amber\r\nyellow, with small brown spots. The leaves are large and very entire,\r\nand more yellowish than those of the Muscat. The growth of the vine is\r\nupright, with erect or climbing branches. This grapevine in order to\r\nbear must be pruned long, and should properly be staked from four to\r\nfive feet high. The yield of the Sultana is very heavy, and as much as\r\nsixteen tons of fresh grapes are frequently harvested from an acre,\r\nprovided the soil is the very best possible. The grapes begin to color\r\nand sweeten several weeks before the Muscat, but they become fully ripe\r\nlater than this variety, and are on that account not as extensively\r\ngrown as they certainly deserve to be. For districts with long summers\r\nand autumns the Sultana will prove a very profitable and desirable\r\ngrape. The native home of the Sultana is Asia Minor. There it is grown\r\nprincipally around Smyrna and in several of the islands in the\r\nArchipelago. In California only few Sultana vineyards are planted; still\r\nthere is undoubtedly a great field for this grape where the seasons are\r\nlong enough to allow of its perfect ripening. The raisins are light in\r\ncolor and somewhat acid, but with no particular flavor, and in this\r\nrespect are inferior to the Muscats and the Currants. They are produced\r\neither by dipping, as is done in Smyrna, or by sun-drying, as we do in\r\nthis State. If the dipping process is used, the grapes must be very\r\nripe, else they will turn reddish and dark and lose quality. In\r\nCalifornia the Sultana grape does well, and only seldom produces seeds.\r\nIn Eastern Mediterranean countries, except in the few favored spots of\r\nSmyrna, or in some of the Islands, this variety rapidly deteriorates and\r\nbecomes seed-bearing, which of course entirely ruins its usefulness. The\r\nSeedless Sultana was first brought to California by Colonel Agoston\r\nHaraszthy in 1861.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Black Currant._--This variety is but little known in this State. The\r\ngrowth is erect and climbing. The bunches are long, narrow and\r\ncylindrical, with heavy shoulders. The berries are small, of the size of\r\npeas, seedless and black, very sweet and with a peculiar aroma not found\r\nin any other variety. The Black Currant should be pruned short, and the\r\nyoung branches require staking in order to bear well. The home of the\r\nBlack Currant is the Grecian Islands as well as Morea, especially around\r\nPatras. Zante, Cephalonia and Ithaca all produce Currants of the highest\r\nquality.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Other Varieties of Currants._--The White Currant grown in California is\r\nnot the true raisin grape which produces the Currant of commerce. The\r\nbunch and berry resemble the Black Currant, but differ in not being\r\nblack, and in lacking the peculiar aroma and flavor alone possessed by\r\nthe Black and true Currant. There are in Greece several other varieties\r\nof Currants, such as red and gray, but these are used for wine and not\r\nfor raisins. The White and Red Currants were introduced from Crimea in\r\n1861 by Colonel Agoston Haraszthy.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Thompson Seedless._--This variety has been growing in California for\r\nmany years, but has only lately come into notice. It was imported from\r\nRochester, New York, from the establishment of Elwanger & Barry, about\r\n1872, and was by them described as a grape from Constantinople under the\r\nname of Lady Decoverly. Thompson Seedless is the name given this grape\r\nby the local growers around Yuba City, and not the original name. I am\r\ninclined to believe that this grape is related to, but not identical\r\nwith, the oblong, seedless grape which is grown around Damascus in Asia\r\nMinor, and there dried into a raisin of very good quality. This Damascus\r\ngrape is brownish when ripe. Thompson Seedless is an oval grape,\r\ngreenish yellow, as large as a Sultana, seedless, with thin skin, good\r\nbut not strong flavor, and without that acid which characterizes the\r\nSultana grape and raisin. The bunches are large, or very large, and the\r\nvine is an enormous bearer. As yet it is principally grown around Yuba\r\nCity and Marysville in limited quantities, but the raisins are in good\r\ndemand. When sun-dried and cured, these raisins are bluish and dark like\r\nMuscats, but narrower and more tapering, and only a quarter the size.\r\nTheir sweetness and taste commend them for cooking purposes, and the\r\nbearing quality of the vine will no doubt make their growing profitable\r\nin all places where the seasons are too short to thoroughly ripen the\r\nSultana. In Yuba this grape ripens early in August.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Other Seedless Grapes._--In the Islands of Lipari and Pantelleria a\r\ncoarse but seedless grape is grown, out of which a variety of Sultana\r\nraisin is made. We have no further notices and description of this\r\nvariety.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Malaga._--This is not a real raisin grape, but of late years raisins\r\nhave been made from it and found both fair in quality and profitable to\r\nthe grower. The Malaga is a heavy bearer of one crop of very large but\r\nloose bunches. There is no second crop. The berries are large, oval, not\r\ntapering, the flesh is meaty and solid, very sweet, but with no decided\r\nflavor. The skin is thick and green, when ripe amber yellow, with thick\r\nbloom. Raisins made of this grape are very large, and the bunches are\r\nalso large and solid, and the berries are not easily torn off. When\r\nsweated, the skin becomes thinner, and the quality improves generally.\r\nThe Malaga is a very hardy vine, not particular about soil, a strong\r\ngrower, bears well, and its grapes ripen at the time of the Muscats.\r\nBut, as there is no second crop, the vintage of the Malaga will be over\r\nlong before that of the Muscats, and out of the way of rain or fog. This\r\nis what makes this grape so valuable. Four cents per pound has been paid\r\nfor these raisins in sweatboxes for the past two years, and at that\r\nprice this grape pays better than the Muscats. The Malaga raisins are\r\nalso very heavy and solid. I am satisfied that there will be a good\r\ndemand for this raisin, especially among consumers, who prefer a bunch\r\nraisin, but who do not care to pay for the expensive packing which is\r\nnecessary to preserve the Muscat bunches. The Malaga raisin could be\r\nsold in bulk, and still would not break up. The Malaga grape is grown in\r\nmany places in California, and is used principally as a table grape; it\r\nhas only been cured and dried into raisins in Fresno. According to A. B.\r\nButler, this grape is grown in Malaga for table purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Feher Szagos._--Feher Szagos raisins have been in the market for\r\nseveral years, and have brought in sweatboxes from three to three and a\r\nhalf cents per pound. This grape is a heavy bearer and grower, branches\r\nerect but slender, leaves glossy, entire, bunches medium to small,\r\npointed and solid. The berries are greenish amber, medium, oval,\r\npointed, with thin skin, and few and small seeds. The flesh is not firm,\r\nbut dries well, and when dried the raisin is very good, with a peculiar\r\nflavor of its own. They are only used for cooking, but are nevertheless\r\nrather good raisins to eat, and their seeds are so soft that they are\r\nnot objectionable. The bearing quality of the Feher Szagos is very\r\nheavy, as much as sixteen tons of green grapes having been raised to the\r\nacre, and from ten to twelve tons is a common yield. It ripens with the\r\nMuscat, and the vine bears only one crop. At three cents per pound, the\r\nFeher Szagos is a profitable grape. The native home of this variety is\r\nHungary or Southern Austria, the name meaning, in Hungarian, White Jack.\r\nIn Fresno it is grown quite extensively, having originally been planted\r\nas a wine grape. As such it is highly valued, producing an abundance of\r\nhighly flavored sherry.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Other Raisin Grapes._--In Asia Minor, the Grecian Islands, Morea,\r\nItaly, Spain and Morocco, there are grown a number of varieties of\r\ngrapes which are cured into raisins and sold as such. Many of these are\r\nlittle, if any, better than our dried grapes, while others again are\r\nsuperior, more resembling the regular raisins. Among the latter we have\r\nthe Spanish Black and Red, and the Smyrna and Turkish Black and Red.\r\nSome of them belong to the Muscat family, probably resembling Black and\r\nRed Muscats, but of these varieties we have no particular information,\r\nand our growers will probably not lose much by avoiding a more intimate\r\nacquaintance with them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISEASES AND INSECT PESTS.\r\n\r\n  The following short account of the diseases and insect pests is not\r\n  intended to be exhaustive, and is only intended to refer to the raisin\r\n  districts of our State. I have not included accounts of the phylloxera\r\n  nor of other insects or fungi which do not exist in these districts,\r\n  but which may be troublesome in other parts of the State. Strictly\r\n  scientific descriptions have purposely been left out, but I have\r\n  endeavored to make the popular account as correct and as condensed as\r\n  possible. Of insects and fungi I have only enumerated those which are\r\n  of importance through the damage they occasion from time to time.\r\n  Those which prey on the vines, but which cause no great damage, and\r\n  which the grower need not prepare himself to fight, have here been\r\n  left out.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOWDERY MILDEW OR UNCINULA.\r\n\r\n\r\n_General Notes._--This disease of the grapevine is caused by the growth\r\nof parasitic fungus known in Europe as _Oidium Tuckeri_, and in this\r\ncountry as _Uncinula spiralis_ or powdery mildew. I am satisfied the two\r\nnames signify the same fungus, only the European form has never been\r\nfound as highly developed as the American one, which has on that account\r\nreceived a name of its own. If the two are identical, then the European\r\nOidium, which for many years caused the destruction of the transatlantic\r\nvineyards, was imported to that country from this. The _Uncinula\r\nspiralis_ is undoubtedly native on our indigenous vines.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Characteristics._--The mildew appears in two different stages, one in\r\nthe spring when the vines are in blossom, the other again later in the\r\nsummer when the fruit is more advanced. The first stage of the mildew\r\nresembles a fine cobweb spun between the flowers of the bunch. If\r\nallowed unrestricted sway, the flowers will drop off, the fruit will\r\nnever set, or set only imperfectly, and the crop will be a great loss or\r\neven a total failure. Generally the inexperienced vineyardist does not\r\nperceive the mildew until too late. A slight touch to the vine will then\r\nbring down all the young fruit or blossoms like a shower, and the stem\r\nof the bunch will be seen to be entirely bare, or with only a few\r\nscattered berries. This form of the Uncinula mildew has not been as\r\nscientifically investigated as would be desirable, and nothing is known\r\nas regards its development. It is possibly a primary generation and\r\nearly stage of the later Uncinula. I believe this form of the mildew is\r\nidentical with the disease which is called Colure by the French, and\r\nwhich is characterized by the dropping of the young, undeveloped grapes.\r\nThe first appearance of this mildew is always accompanied by white,\r\nsalty excrescences on the edges of the grape leaves. Whether they are\r\ndirectly or indirectly connected with the fungus is not known.\r\n\r\nThe later form, the powdery mildew, and the form which has given this\r\nmildew its name, appears later in the season, when the grapes are half\r\ngrown or more. It then takes the shape of fine powder-like patches or\r\nblotches on the upper side of the leaves, stems or berries. These spots\r\nare of a dull gray or whitish gray color, and smell strongly of mold or\r\nmushrooms. If these mildew spots when young are rubbed smooth,\r\nespecially on the green stems or berries, we see below them, in the\r\nepidermis of the vine, the _mycelium_ or stem of the fungus spreading in\r\nall directions from a central point, like the roots of a tree or plant.\r\nThis part of the mildew corresponds with the stem and root of a plant,\r\nwhile the upper, powdery part is the one which produces the spores or\r\nthe seed, conidia and peritheca, all of which are reproductive organs.\r\nThe grapes thus attacked gradually dry up or crack open. The leaves are\r\neaten through and dry up, and the whole plant becomes badly diseased,\r\nand may even die.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Powdery Mildew (Oidium Form), Greatly Magnified.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_History and Distribution._--The powdery mildew or Oidium was observed\r\nfor the first time in the year 1845 in hothouses in England. It\r\nimmediately began to spread, and in a few years infested all the vine\r\ndistricts of the Old World. Before any remedy had been discovered, many\r\nvine districts were so injured that they have not since been able to\r\nrecover. Thus in 1850 and 1851 France suffered greatly from this mildew,\r\nand the Island of Madeira, which for three hundred years had produced\r\nthe finest wines, had its grapevines so injured that they up to this\r\ntime have not again produced as good a quality of grapes as before the\r\nadvent of the disease. The Grecian Islands as well as Morea were also\r\nvisited by the powdery mildew, and though the latter is now kept in\r\ncontrol, the general opinion is that the quality of the currants is not\r\nas high as it was before the mildew appeared. Now there is probably no\r\nplace in the Old World where grapes are not attacked by this mildew,\r\nalthough some places are injured much more than others. Adjoining\r\nvineyards are often differently attacked, some being even entirely free,\r\nwhile others are visited yearly. Young vines are less attacked than old\r\nones, and in favorable places the mildew seldom infests vines before\r\nthey are two or three years old. Elevated places and localities exposed\r\nto winds and cold are generally attacked by the first stages of this\r\noidium, while its second or last stage prefers low, damp places exposed\r\nto dew or fog.\r\n\r\nThe American form of the powdery mildew or _Uncinula spiralis_ differs\r\nin some respects from the European Oidium, not as to its effects, but as\r\nto its microscopical characteristics. The Oidium occurs in Europe only\r\nwith certain generative organs called gonidia, while the American\r\n_Uncinula_ also develops so-called _peritheca_. It is more than probable\r\nthat both fungi belong to the same species, but until these perithecal\r\norgans have been found on the European Oidium, the proper name for our\r\nmildew must be _Uncinula_, and not Oidium. It is also probable that the\r\n_Uncinula_ fungus is a native of this continent, and that it from here\r\nhas spread to Europe, where the natural conditions are such that only\r\nthe gonidial form of the fungus has been able to develop. In general\r\nappearance and in their effects the _Uncinula_ and Oidium are identical.\r\n\r\nThe Oidium appears sooner on poor soil and on exhausted vines, and vines\r\nin which the flow of the sap for some reason or other has been checked\r\nare more subject to the mildew than those which are yet in full growing\r\nvigor. Elevated vines on trellises which are much exposed, and vines\r\nwhich are so covered up that the air has little access, are the first\r\nones to be attacked, and those which will suffer the most. The powdery\r\nmildew affects all varieties of grapes, but some kinds more than others.\r\nThe Muscats are among those which suffer considerably, and if not\r\nsulphured would in severe cases neither set nor bear suitable grapes.\r\nThe Malaga is less affected, and so is the Sultana. In new districts the\r\nUncinula does not appear until the vines are older. Thus in the Fresno\r\ndistrict the earliest vines did not suffer from mildew until they became\r\nfive years old, but now the mildew would destroy the grapes every year,\r\nin case they were not treated with sulphur.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Remedies._--The most common and perhaps the best remedy is powdered\r\nsulphur. The latter is applied either with the dust can or “dredger,” or\r\nwith bellows. The dust can is used when the vines or vine shoots are yet\r\nsmall, and the bellows when the vines are larger. The first sulphuring\r\nshould be done when the young shoots are six inches long, immediately\r\nbefore the bloom, and the second time when the berries are well set.\r\nSulphuring as a regular vineyard operation will be more fully discussed\r\nfurther on.\r\n\r\n\r\nDOWNY MILDEW OR PERONOSPORA.\r\n\r\n\r\n_General Notes._--The downy mildew is a fungus known botanically as\r\n_Peronospora viticola_. Its native country is the United States, but its\r\ngreatest damage is done in Europe. It appears as white, downy spots on\r\nthe underside of the grape leaves, which are gradually destroyed, and\r\nlater on attacks the berries, which shrivel and spoil. In California the\r\ndowny mildew occurs frequently on wild native grapevines, but only very\r\nrarely on the cultivated Asiatic vines. Dr. H. W. Harkness, the eminent\r\nmycologist, found it only once on cultivated vines in the Sacramento\r\nriver bottom. These vines were growing close to native vines, from which\r\nthe fungus had spread. There is no fear that this fungus will ever\r\nspread and cause damage in our State as long as the vineyards are given\r\nplenty of air. In France the _Peronospora_ has caused much damage, but\r\nis now being combated with bluestone and lime solutions, according to\r\nthe following formula: Slake thirty pounds of lime in seven and a half\r\ngallons of water, also mix sixteen pounds of bluestone (copper sulphate)\r\nin twenty-five gallons of water. Mix the two together, and either\r\nsprinkle the foliage with it, or dilute it further with say five\r\nhundred gallons of water and spray the vine leaves on both the upper and\r\nlower sides. According to Dr. Harkness the efficiency of this spray\r\ncannot always be relied on. So far no other fungi have appeared in the\r\nraisin districts of this State, nor have we reason to fear that any will\r\nattack the vines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Downy Mildew (_Peronospora_), Greatly Magnified. _a._ The\r\nFungus Growing out of a Stoma of the Vine Leaf. _b._ Transversal Section\r\nof Vine Leaf, showing Fungi and their Tuberous Mycelium.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VINE PLAGUE.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Characteristics._--The first, or at least the most characteristic signs\r\nof this disease appear especially after a summer rain, or after the\r\nfirst fall rain. The leaves then become spotted with yellow. The\r\nfollowing season these yellow spots appear as if fused together, and\r\nmany leaves become entirely yellow, except the veins, which stand out\r\nbright green. Some leaves are invaded by the yellow from the edges,\r\nwhile the veins as before remain green. These yellow spots soon turn\r\nbrown, the leaves dry up and curl slightly backwards and finally fall\r\noff, leaving the canes bare. During the very first appearance of the\r\nvine plague, many leaves turn brown and dry up in certain spots in the\r\nvineyard without the previous appearance of any yellow spots. The drying\r\nof the leaves proceeds either from the center of the spots, or from the\r\nmargin of the leaves, destroying both the leaves and their veins. Later\r\non in the fall a new crop of leaves appear, but these leaves are small\r\nor very small, bright green and sickly, and do not continue to develop\r\nafter they have reached a certain size, different in different vines. In\r\nred varieties of grapes, the yellow spots in the leaves gradually turn\r\nred or claret colored, often resembling the most beautiful autumn\r\nleaves. In districts where the disease is common, these leaves are\r\ngenerally known as calico leaves on account of their peculiar markings.\r\n\r\nThe canes do not attain their regular growth, and fail to mature in the\r\nfall, or mature only in spots, the balance of the wood remaining dull\r\ngreen. The inner parts of the canes are, as a rule, more mature than the\r\ntips. Very often only one or two joints nearest the stem mature, and in\r\nbad cases no part of the canes mature, but at the advent of the rain\r\nturn black and die. Late in the fall the tips of the green canes turn\r\nblack, dry up and snap off like glass when touched. The pith turns in\r\nthe older canes dark brown, dries up prematurely and dies, while in very\r\nyoung canes the pith remains watery like a semi-transparent jelly.\r\n\r\nMany vines have no mature wood when the leaves have fallen in the\r\nautumn, while others again have some. While the spotted leaves may\r\nappear all over the vineyard, the diseased canes appear on vines in\r\nspots, these spots in the vineyard growing larger year after year. A\r\ndead vine may be seen in the midst of healthy ones, while a healthy\r\nvine, on the other hand, may remain in the midst of dead ones. It takes\r\ngenerally several years to kill the vines, and some varieties are\r\nhardier than others. Some Muscats may succumb in one year, while some\r\nwill last for three years or more. The roots remain alive and healthy\r\nlonger than any other part, and, when the top of the vine has already\r\ndied, it is common to see the root send up a healthy sucker, which,\r\nhowever, in its turn, will become diseased and die. It is likely that\r\nthe vines in some districts will suffer more than in others, and in\r\nplaces the vines may not become seriously injured by the disease.\r\n\r\nThe berries on badly diseased vines do not develop, but shrivel up or\r\nremain sour, and in some cases dry up entirely. In others, again, they\r\nacquire a mawkish taste, lose flavor and sweetness, and make only\r\ninferior or bad raisins. These many different characteristics of the\r\nplague depend evidently on the stage of infection. They do not follow\r\neach other in any certain succession, nor do they all appear on the same\r\nvine. Some vines show one face of the disease, other vines show another,\r\nand the observer must have been previously acquainted with the disease\r\nbefore he can readily recognize it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nature and Cause._--The cause of the vine plague is not known. No\r\ndeadly fungus has so far been found on the vine, nor has any other\r\ndeadly parasite been found on the diseased vines. In California the vine\r\nplague has been studied by N. B. Pierce, of the Agricultural Department\r\nat Washington. He suggested once that the disease was of bacterial\r\nnature, but has not proved his theory, his investigations not yet being\r\nfinished. Mr. E. Dowlen has also been investigating this disease, and at\r\none time thought it caused by a fungus, which, however, was proved later\r\nby Dr. H. W. Harkness to belong to the non-injurious kind. No insects of\r\nany kind prey on the vines in sufficient numbers to cause the serious\r\nsymptoms of the vine plague.[7] Whatever may be the true cause of the\r\nvine plague, certain it is that it resembles in its advent and spreading\r\nsuch diseases in men as cholera, yellow fever or the Oriental plague.\r\nThe vine plague appears to be especially promoted by warm, moist air and\r\nrain, but it is not confined to damp places, nor has it as yet been\r\nascertained in what relation it stands to locality and climate.\r\n\r\n  [7] The most interesting and correct account of the vine plague yet\r\n  published is found in an essay on “The Mysterious Vine Disease,” by\r\n  Newton B. Pierce, read before the State Horticultural Convention, at\r\n  Los Angeles, March, 1890, and published in CALIFORNIA--A JOURNAL OF\r\n  RURAL INDUSTRY, May 10, 1890; Vol. 3, No. 18.\r\n\r\nIn California it first made its general appearance in Anaheim in Orange\r\ncounty, in the month of August, 1884, when vineyards of old Mission\r\nvines suddenly stopped growing, and the grapes failed to color and\r\nripen, while many of the vines died the same year. The plague attacks in\r\npreference vines growing on poor, sandy or alkaline soil, or in\r\nvineyards underlaid with hardpan. The weak vines succumb the first of\r\nany. This is the reason why so many vineyardists doubt the existence of\r\nany particular disease, contributing the poor condition of the vineyard\r\nto anything else than the true cause.\r\n\r\nN. B. Pierce, who has now spent a year in studying the vine plague, has\r\nfound many similarities between it and the _mal nero_ of Italy; but the\r\ndescriptions of the foreign investigators are both contradictory and\r\ninsufficient, and, without a personal investigation of the Italian or\r\nFrench vines, the identity of our vine plague with any foreign disease\r\ncannot be established. It is to be hoped that the United States Congress\r\nwill make such investigations possible. At present we do not even know\r\nwhether the vine plague is original in this country or whether it was\r\nimported from foreign countries. The general opinion in the first\r\nattacked district is that the disease was imported there with grapevines\r\nbrought from Europe. So far I have not been able to ascertain when and\r\nby whom such vines were imported, but I am satisfied that in the course\r\nof time it will be found that foreign grapevines were imported to the\r\nvineyards where shortly afterwards this disease first appeared.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Damages._--The damages caused by the vine plague may be summed up as\r\nfollows: The leaves turn spotted and yellow, finally dry up and fall\r\noff. The canes fail to mature, or mature only in spots. Later in the\r\nfall, they die from the tips, which turn black and become brittle. The\r\nberries either dry up or shrivel up, and fail to mature, or at any rate\r\nbecome mawkish or bitter. The yield becomes less and less every year,\r\nalthough, the first year that the vines are touched by the disease, the\r\nyield is often unusually large. In severe cases the vine dies in from\r\none to three years, but a few may linger longer.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Remedies._--The vine plague has existed in this State for six or eight\r\nyears, but as yet few, if any, efforts have been made to extinguish it,\r\nand only during the last year have any experiments been carried on. The\r\nsolutions of bluestone and lime which many expected would prove\r\nbeneficial to the vines attacked by the plague have, in my opinion, done\r\nlittle or no good. Spraying the vines when in full foliage with the\r\nI X L compound greatly benefits the vines, and proves a powerful\r\nstimulant and the best remedy yet employed.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEAF-HOPPER (_Erythroneura comes_).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Characteristics._--This pernicious little pest is a bug which\r\nmultiplies in enormous quantities and sucks the sap out of the vine\r\nleaves. Many use the name of thrips to denote this insect, but this is\r\nincorrect, as the thrips is an entirely different, much smaller, insect,\r\nwhich so far has never been injurious to the vines of this coast. In\r\nsize the leaf-hopper is, at maturity, about one-tenth of an inch. In\r\ncolor it is yellowish white, with a few red spots. When the insect\r\napproaches maturity, it jumps, but the undeveloped insect or larva only\r\ncrawls, principally on the underside of the vine leaves, where their\r\ncast-off skins can be seen in all stages and sizes. The eggs are laid in\r\nthe veins of the leaves. The glossy globules which are always seen on\r\nleaves where the leaf-hopper is found are not the eggs, as has been\r\nsupposed by many, but is only the vomit which, when irritated, the\r\nhopper throws out either as a defense, or because it desires to rid\r\nitself of an unnecessary burden. The leaf-hopper hatches at least two\r\ntimes, or possibly three times, during the summer. Many of the insects\r\nremain over during winter time. They feed on almost anything, such as\r\n_alfilerilla_ (_Erodium_), etc., but are especially fond of the\r\ngrapevines, and even in the early spring flock onto the young vine\r\nshoots, leaving the less desirable weeds. In some localities this insect\r\nis known variously as the white fly, the vine-hopper, or incorrectly as\r\nthe thrips.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Damages._--The hopper punctures the leaves and causes them to dry up\r\nand fall, thus exposing the grapes to the hot sun. The excrement of the\r\nhoppers also covers the grapes largely, and spoils their appearance and\r\nkeeping quality, at least as table grapes. It is principally the table\r\ngrapes and wine grapes which are injured by this insect; the former are\r\nmade unfit for shipment, and the latter do not color well when deprived\r\nof their leaves. If the grapevines are kept growing, the grapes are less\r\ninjured, and some growers even contend that the hopper is advantageous,\r\nas it causes the leaves to fall and the grapes to mature.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Distribution._--It is not known whether the leaf-hopper is a native of\r\nCalifornia, and I hardly believe it is. It does not exist in Southern\r\nCalifornia, but in Northern California and in the San Joaquin valley it\r\nis common. In the grape districts of Southern California there is found\r\nanother variety of leaf-hopper almost twice the size and of a brilliant\r\ngreen color, which only once appeared in such quantity as to do any\r\ndamage at all. Generally it is quite rare. The _Erythroneura comes_,\r\nhowever, occurs in countless numbers, and often rises in clouds when the\r\nvines are approached. In some years it is less common than in others,\r\nand after having been plentiful for several years gradually diminishes\r\nin quantity, but never disappears entirely.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Remedies._--Pasturing the vineyards with sheep as soon as the grapes\r\nare picked is very beneficial. The sheep destroy both hoppers and\r\nleaves, and the following season always finds the hoppers greatly\r\ndiminished in numbers. The sheep do no injury to low-pruned vines, and\r\nin Fresno many vineyardists pasture their vines regularly every year in\r\nOctober and November, or as soon as the grapes are picked and the\r\nvineyards are made accessible.\r\n\r\nThe gauze bell consists of a bell-shaped cover made of wire netting,\r\nlarge enough to cover the vine. The inside of the bell is sprayed with\r\npetroleum, and then turned over the vine. A shake is then given the\r\nvine, when many leaf-hoppers will fly up and stick in the petroleum. It\r\nwill only pay to use this remedy on table grapes; for raisin grapes it\r\nis too expensive.\r\n\r\n\r\nRED SPIDER.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Characteristics._--Red or yellow mites are quite frequently injurious\r\nto grapevines. These mites are small, almost microscopical, and appear\r\nin enormous quantities on both sides of the leaves, especially, however,\r\non their under side. They cover the leaves, and even the ground of the\r\nvineyard, with a thick cobweb, in which they live and hatch. Dry air and\r\nheat promote the wellbeing of the mites, and hasten the injury they do\r\nto the vine leaves, which soon dry up and check the growth of the vines.\r\nOn the contrary, dew and moisture destroy the red mites in a short time,\r\nand in places near the coast they are seldom very injurious.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Remedies._--Sprays of various kinds, such as whale-oil soap, resin\r\nsprays, etc., have been used. Frequent spraying with pure water will\r\ndestroy the mites, but they will multiply again if the climate is\r\nfavorable. The best success is had with a spray of a compound known as\r\nthe I X L compound, which is used in the proportion of five pounds of\r\nthe compound to thirty gallons of water. One good spray will destroy\r\nboth the mites and their eggs.\r\n\r\n\r\nCATERPILLARS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Characteristics._--The caterpillars which trouble the raisin grapes are\r\nconfined to three or four kinds. The most common and also the most\r\ndestructive are the very large larvæ of the sphinx moth. The common\r\ngrapevine sphinx (_Philampelus achæmon_) is a large larva, incorrectly\r\ncalled a worm, which is, when full grown, over three inches long. The\r\ncolor varies from bluish green to brown, with several lighter stripes on\r\neach side. The head is truncate, and the tail is furnished with a curved\r\nhorn. The _pupa_ hibernates in the soil below the vines, and is about\r\nhalf the size of the full-grown caterpillar. The full-grown moth is\r\nabout two inches long by two and one-half inches between the\r\noutstretched wings. The eggs are laid by the moths on the leaves of the\r\nvines. Two broods of caterpillars appear yearly under favorable\r\nconditions, or else only one brood, which generally appears in the end\r\nof July. The caterpillars grow with great rapidity, and attain their\r\nfull size in a few weeks. The _pupæ_ hibernate in the soil and hatch the\r\nfollowing summer.\r\n\r\nAnother large grapevine caterpillar is the _Deilephila striata_, which\r\nis about the same size as the _Achæmon_. The moth has more pointed\r\nwings, with narrow stripes, and the larva is brighter colored, often\r\nyellowish green, with several colored stripes on the sides. The eggs are\r\nnot laid on the vines, but on the weeds on the vacant lands outside the\r\nvineyard, especially on species of _Epilobium_, but also on other weeds,\r\nand they hatch and feed on them. The caterpillars feed in ordinary years\r\nonly on the weeds on which they are bred, but in other years which are\r\nespecially favorable to their enormous increase they migrate to the\r\nvineyards and feed on the vines at the most alarming rate. The\r\ncaterpillars of both the above large moths vary in color from green to\r\nbrown or violet brown, but as a rule the _Deilephila_ is more brightly\r\ncolored than the _Achæmon_. The former is more active and often travels\r\nin enormous numbers, when it is called the army-worm. The _Achæmon_ is\r\nmore blunt at both extremities, the head being almost truncate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Vineyard Scene, Rosedale Colony, Kern County, July,\r\n1890.--Three Months After Planting.]\r\n\r\nArmy-worms are smaller caterpillars, about one inch or more in length,\r\nwhich breed on the outside weeds, and which, when feed becomes scarce,\r\nmigrate to the vineyards and feed on the vines. These caterpillars are\r\nthe larvæ of smaller moths of various genera such as _Prodenia_ and\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nCutworms are other caterpillars of moths of the genus _Agrotis_, which\r\nfeed on the branches of the vines, especially in the night-time, and in\r\nthe daytime bury themselves in the soil beneath the vine. They are\r\ngenerally a gray or leathery color, while the army-worms are more violet\r\nand darker.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Damages._--The damages from these various caterpillars are sometimes\r\nvery large. Some years they occur in enormous quantities, and hundreds\r\nof tons of them may then be picked from a vineyard of a hundred acres of\r\nvines. The leaves are eaten by them, and the grapes are either scalded\r\nby the sun or do not attain their sweetness and coloring. Sometimes\r\nthese various caterpillars are very common and destructive for one or\r\ntwo years in succession, after which they disappear and do not return to\r\ntrouble the vines again for many years.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Remedies._--The great caterpillars, after they have once infested the\r\nvineyard, can be destroyed by picking. A gang of men or boys should be\r\nfurnished with buckets, which are besmeared on the inside with coal-oil.\r\nThe caterpillars are picked and dropped in the buckets, from which they\r\ncannot crawl out, and when the buckets are half filled they may be\r\nemptied into trenches and covered up with soil.\r\n\r\nMany use small scissors, with which the caterpillars are cut in twain\r\nwhile sitting on the vines. This will do for wine grapes, which are\r\ngrown higher above the ground, but will hardly be proper on the low\r\nMuscat vines, as the contents of the caterpillars are apt to soil the\r\ngrapes.\r\n\r\nI have used Buhach sprays with great success. Ten pounds of Buhach, with\r\na hundred gallons of water, brought the caterpillars down from the vines\r\nin forty-five minutes after spraying. As some, however, recovered, it is\r\nbest to kill as many as possible of those which fall to the ground by\r\npunching them with a stick. The cost of Buhach is, however, great, and\r\nthe difficulty of encountering favorable weather is such that this\r\nremedy is not apt to be extensively used.\r\n\r\nWhen the vineyards are threatened by the invasion of the army-worms, or\r\nby the striped _Deilephila_ caterpillar, the best remedy consists in\r\ntrenching. A narrow trench, say one foot or more wide and two feet deep,\r\nwith perpendicular sides, should immediately be dug around the vineyard.\r\nIf water is at hand, fill the trench with water, on which some coal-oil\r\nmay be poured,--enough to cause a film on the surface. If no water can\r\nbe had, a log or scantling may be continually dragged up and down the\r\nfurrow or trench, so as to crush the caterpillars before they can crawl\r\nout. In many places, however, the trench alone will do the work, as the\r\ncaterpillars will generally not be able to get up the other side of the\r\ntrench. What few crawl up can easily be kept down by hand-picking.\r\n\r\nIf certain attractive flowers, such as honey-suckles or petunias, are\r\nplanted on a small bed in the vineyard, say near the house, the moths\r\nwill come to them to feed from all the surrounding neighborhood. Only\r\none small bed should be planted on every vineyard. A boy with a\r\nbutterfly net, posted at each flower bed at sundown, can catch hundreds\r\nof moths every evening, and considerably reduce their number and prevent\r\nthem from breeding.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLACK-KNOT.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Characteristics._--The woody or spongy excrescences which appear on the\r\nvines, and which are known as black-knots, are really only a wart-like\r\ngrowth, the origin of which is entirely unknown. It is supposed that an\r\ninsufficient outlet for the sap in the spring caused by too close\r\npruning is the chief cause. Certainly closely pruned vines are more\r\nsubject to the black-knot than long pruned vines, but on the other hand\r\nneglected vines which have had no cultivation, and which accordingly\r\ncould hardly have had too rapid a flow of sap, suffer more than any\r\nothers. The woody warts appear quite frequently on the ends of the spurs\r\nof the old wood, or on places of last year’s growth which have been\r\nwounded or injured in some way, but never on the green wood. They vary\r\nin size from that of a pea to that of lumps weighing several pounds.\r\nWhen present in small quantities, the warts cause no injury, but when\r\nthey become larger the vines may even die. These black-knots always die\r\nwith the year, and never survive to the next season. At the end of the\r\nseason, they burst open and then often display black spores of fungi,\r\nwhich, however, are only parasitical growths on the already decayed\r\nwood, and not the cause of the disease. As I said, it is generally\r\nsupposed that the flow of sap is during spring time so great that it\r\nruptures the cells of the vine and causes the warts to form. Under the\r\nmicroscope, however, there are no such ruptured cells visible. It is\r\nmore natural to suppose, that through the accumulation of sap an\r\nirritating poison is originated, which causes the warty growth to form\r\nin a manner similar to the formation of galls. On sandy soil the\r\nblack-knot is the most common, probably on account of the earliness and\r\nthe natural warmth of this kind of soil.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Remedies._--So far no decidedly successful remedy has been found. Some\r\ngrowers advise leaving plenty of spurs on the vine, so as to give a\r\nsufficient outlet to the sap, but it remains to be seen if this will\r\nmitigate the evil. If the black-knot should be very destructive, a\r\ncutting out of the same in summer time while they are forming would be\r\nbeneficial. This could best be done in June and July. Mixtures of\r\ncoal-oil and lime, etc., have been used during the winter after the\r\nvines were already pruned, but, as the black-knot is then already dead,\r\nno advantages can result from this remedy.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRASSHOPPERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_General Notes._--While grasshoppers cannot be considered as a common\r\npest in the vineyard, still they are at times greatly destructive.\r\nThere has been during the last sixteen years two such invasions of\r\ngrasshoppers in the California raisin districts. The grasshoppers are of\r\nmany species, some seventeen kinds having been recognized one season.\r\nThey all breed in the waste or unplowed ground outside the vineyard, and\r\nwhen full-grown invade the vines. This fact can be taken advantage of to\r\ndestroy them.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Remedies._--The waste lands for a half mile at least all around the\r\nvineyard should be plowed and harrowed in the early spring. This will\r\ndestroy the eggs of the grasshoppers, and the fallow land will serve as\r\na barrier over which the grasshoppers do not readily pass.\r\n\r\nIf the vineyards are so situated that the weeds or natural vegetation on\r\nthe land surrounding the vines can be burned for half a mile or more,\r\nthis will also prove a certain barrier for the hoppers.\r\n\r\nA mixture of fifteen pounds of white arsenic with eighty pounds of bran\r\nand twenty pounds of middlings, moistened with enough water to make a\r\npaste, will be eaten by the grasshoppers. The paste is spread on bits of\r\nshakes or shingles and distributed all around the vineyard, and later on\r\nin the vineyard. It may also be smeared on fences or trees. The\r\ngrasshoppers will eat it readily, and can thus be successfully\r\ndestroyed. If this method is used in time, the advancing army of the\r\npest can be kept back or destroyed at the very entrance of the vineyard.\r\nAs another remedy, a spray is recommended consisting of one ounce of\r\nParis green, one hundred gallons of water, and two pounds of paste. This\r\nis sprayed on the trees or vines, and is said to kill the grasshoppers\r\neffectively without injuring the fruit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RAISIN VINEYARD.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANTING.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Distances for Muscat Vines._--An examination of the various vineyards\r\nin any or in all the different raisin districts will not help us much in\r\ndeciding upon how far apart the vines should be set, as most vineyards\r\nhave been planted by men of no previous experience in the raisin\r\nbusiness, and when that experience was at last acquired the vineyards\r\nwere already established and could not easily be changed. In planting,\r\nwe are too apt to do as other people do without first inquiring from\r\nthem if their experience has not taught them anything else, and if they\r\nwould not do otherwise if they had to commence over again. For years the\r\nstandard distances between raisin-vines have been eight by eight feet.\r\nOf late years this distance was considered too small, as our soil was\r\nsupposed to be so rich, that all that was required, in order to get\r\nlarge crops, was to give the vines plenty of room. Many vineyards have\r\nbeen set nine by nine, nine by ten, ten by ten, or even ten by twelve\r\nand twelve by sixteen feet. The effect has, however, been different from\r\nthat which was expected. Instead of producing larger crops, those vines\r\nwhich were given more room produced only more wood and more leaves. They\r\nfollowed that law of nature, which causes any animal or vegetable to\r\ngrow luxuriantly when overfed, and which, on the contrary, causes seed\r\nand fruit to form when the vegetable system is restricted to certain\r\nproportions, which, of course, we can only determine by actual\r\nexperience. By giving the vines less space, some inconvenience will be\r\nexperienced in working the soil, and in drying the crop between the\r\nrows. On that account some vineyards have been planted with the vines\r\ncloser one way than the other, thus giving plenty of room in which to\r\nwork the soil, while on the other hand sufficiently confining the vines\r\nin order to cause them to bear well. I therefore now recommend that the\r\nvines be set four and a half by eleven, five by ten and a half, or five\r\nby eleven feet. The first would probably be my choice. I claim for this\r\nsystem many advantages, and beg intending growers to carefully consider\r\nthe following points:\r\n\r\nIt gives us more vines to the acre, which means more grapes to the acre,\r\nas long as the land is of the best quality, and no raisin grapes should\r\never be planted on inferior soil, or at least the soil should be\r\nsufficiently rich to supply plant food to the greater number of vines.\r\n\r\nIt makes the working of the soil cheaper, and fully one-third more of\r\nthe work can be done by two-horse plows. The single-horse work can be\r\nconfined to plowing a furrow on each side of the vines, and to running a\r\ncultivator crosswise. As the number of rows in this system is less, it\r\nalso follows that less single-team work is needed.\r\n\r\nThe vines protect themselves from the hot sun and hot winds which cause\r\nsunscald. The short distances should be in the direction of the hot\r\nwind, if any there be, or in the direction of east and west if there are\r\nno hot winds in the district. The spaces between the rows will thus\r\ncatch the morning sun, which is of importance when we dry on trays\r\nbetween the vines.\r\n\r\nLess roads will be needed in the vineyard, as the larger distance is\r\nsufficient to enable any teams to pass between every row of vines, and\r\ndistribute trays, boxes, etc., without interfering with the vines. The\r\nsaving thereby of labor in carrying the boxes and trays is quite an item\r\nin vineyards where the vines are planted say eight by eight feet or\r\ncloser.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Land Scrapers.]\r\n\r\nThe trimmings of the vines can be burned in the vineyard between the\r\nrows, and will thus help to fertilize the soil. Besides, the expense of\r\nhauling the trimmings away will be saved.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Marking Out of a Vineyard._--As any practical horticulturist knows\r\nhow to stake out an orchard or vineyard, a minute description is not\r\nhere needed. I will only indicate the most important points. Cut a large\r\nnumber of small pegs, one inch or so square and a foot or so long. Next\r\nget two lines of twisted wire, each say 150 feet long. Mark off on one\r\nwire every five feet by inserting a small, bright copper wire in the\r\ntwist, and wind it around the iron wire three or four times, enough to\r\nshow the place. On the other wire mark off similarly every ten or eleven\r\nfeet, always supposing these are the distances decided upon. Now stretch\r\none of the wires along one end of the future vineyard and call this line\r\nthe base line No. 1. Set a peg close to every copper ringlet, on the\r\nside of the wire away from the vineyard. When done, stretch the other\r\nwire, No. 2, at a right angle with the former, and set pegs similarly.\r\nRemove wire No. 1 from base line No. 1 and stretch it at the end of wire\r\nNo. 2, parallel to the base line. Call this base line No. 2. Set pegs as\r\nbefore every eight feet. It is now evident that, by stretching\r\nsuccessively the wire No. 2 between the pegs set on the two base lines,\r\nand by setting cuttings or rooted vines close to the copper ringlets on\r\nthe wire line, perfectly straight and even rows can be had in every\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nToo much stress cannot be laid on this work. Remember that the vineyard\r\nis to last for a lifetime or more, and that any careless work will ever\r\nbe an eyesore and a drawback. Unsightly vineyards, carelessly staked\r\nout, are never worth as much as those carefully planted, where every row\r\nis straight, and where plowing, cultivating and other farming and\r\nvineyard work can be performed without meeting any obstacles in the way\r\nof crooked rows, or of vines standing out of line. Only too frequently\r\nvineyard rows are plowed out, and the cuttings are “slapped” in anyway\r\nin order to get the work quickly done. In after years, when the\r\nproprietor’s taste and experience has improved, he finds that his\r\nreputation as a careless or ignorant grower cannot be changed; for the\r\nvineyard is there to last, and to tell the tale of early ignorance or\r\nneglect.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 1-_a_, _b_, _c_, _d_.--Vineyard Tools used in the Currant\r\nVineyards of Zante.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Relative Value of Cuttings and Rooted Vines._--Cuttings and rooted\r\nvines have their advocates, but the majority of vineyardists are now in\r\nfavor of planting rooted vines, and I would myself choose the latter\r\nevery time. As, however, rooted vines and cuttings are both likely to be\r\nused as long as vines are planted, a few words in regard to their\r\nrespective merits may be of general interest. In planting cuttings, we\r\nare never sure that they will all grow. Cuttings if cared for generally\r\ndo well, but sometimes, even with good care, they fail, and the loss and\r\nannoyance is then always great, and even in very careful planting seldom\r\nover ninety per cent live, while often twenty-five per cent die. The\r\nreason is often careless planting, when the season is favorable, but in\r\nunfavorable seasons the failure must be attributed to other causes.\r\nThose cuttings which grow, generally grow well and often make as good\r\nvines as those raised from previously rooted ones.\r\n\r\nThe replanting of the cuttings that failed to live is both expensive and\r\ntroublesome. Every vineyardist knows how difficult it is to succeed in\r\nmaking cuttings, or even vines, grow on places in the vineyard where\r\nother ones have failed to grow before. Some attribute this difficulty to\r\nsome poison in the soil, but I believe the cause will be found in the\r\ngreater difficulty to attend to a few young vines in among the older\r\nones. The older vines will naturally use up the moisture in the soil,\r\nand the cuttings, with their young and tender roots, will have but\r\nlittle chance in the general struggle for life. But even if we suppose\r\nthat the replanted vines will do equally well, it will be found that the\r\nreplanting of the cuttings is actually more expensive than the first\r\nplanting. The reason why this is so lies in the greater work in getting\r\nthe soil in first-class condition after the first planting failed. In\r\nthe first planting, the soil has been put in order with the help of\r\nhorses and plows, while, when we replant, the very spots where the vines\r\nare to be located cannot be reached by other means than by a pick or\r\nshovel, as, no matter how well the old vineyard is plowed, there will\r\nalways be a hard spot around every vine, or around the place where the\r\nvine should be, and where it failed to grow. If only a few cuttings have\r\ntaken root, it is better to plow up the whole vineyard and reset, and in\r\nso doing endeavor to do better work. I know of vineyards where the\r\nowners have not succeeded in replanting during ten years, every year\r\nspending money and labor with little success. There will always be a few\r\ncuttings that fail to live.\r\n\r\nThe causes of the uncertainty of cuttings are our inability to foresee\r\nthe outcome of the season’s climatic conditions. More or less rain has a\r\ndirect influence on our success. Thus in very rainy seasons the cuttings\r\nshould be small or rather short, so as to be as much as possible in the\r\nupper, dryer and warmer soil. In dry seasons, again, the cuttings should\r\nbe long, so as to be in the moist ground, but as we can never foresee\r\nwhat the season will be, we had better have a recourse to rooted vines,\r\nwhich, if in good condition, will be comparatively independent of\r\nweather and wind.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Making of Cuttings._--The making of cuttings is not a difficult\r\nprocess, but nevertheless it should be carefully done in order to insure\r\nfinal success. After the vines have been trimmed and the trimmings have\r\nbeen placed in small piles along the rows of the vineyard, the cuttings\r\nshould be made as quickly as possible on the spot, the laborers moving\r\nfrom pile to pile as they finish up. The shears should be sharp and kept\r\nsharp, both to insure good cuttings and to hasten the work. A poor shear\r\nis worse than a poor farmhand, and it pays to keep the best kind of\r\nevery tool that is used in vineyard work. The size of the cutting must\r\nbe decided upon according to the conditions of the soil. If the land is\r\nvery wet and is likely to remain so, an eight-inch, or even a six-inch,\r\ncutting, will do, and will grow better than a long one. Long cuttings\r\nwill reach down into the wet soil and decay at the lower end before\r\nthey take root. In dry and warm soils the cuttings may be from twelve to\r\neighteen inches long, or even longer if it is desirable to bend them in\r\na circular way in the holes in which they are to be planted, or if the\r\nsoil is very warm and dry, when it is of importance that the cutting\r\nshould reach the deeper moisture. A twelve or fourteen inch cutting is\r\nprobably an average size cutting, and one that will answer most\r\nconditions, in case they are not previously known.\r\n\r\nA nurseryman, or any one who can give his cuttings as much attention as\r\nthey require, can use even the very tips of the vines and make them\r\ngrow. But for general planting, especially direct in the field, seldom\r\nmore than one or two cuttings can be made from a branch. The cutting\r\nshould be cut immediately below an eye or joint. Such cuttings grow\r\nbetter, are easier to plant and are less apt to dry out. The more eyes a\r\ncutting contains the better is the cutting, as the roots mostly form at\r\nthe joints. Many make the cuttings with a heel of old wood, but I do not\r\nbelieve such cuttings are in any way preferable to those made of only\r\none season’s wood. The old wood does not grow any better than young\r\nwood, generally not so well, and, besides, such cuttings with heels are\r\nmore difficult to plant and handle. When the cuttings are made, they\r\nshould at first be placed in small piles, with the top ends all the same\r\nway, and as soon as possible afterwards tied up in bundles, with at\r\nleast two strings to every bundle. For tying, any string will do, but\r\nsplit basket-willow twigs are probably the strongest and least apt to\r\nroot. Still any stout twine will answer the purpose. From one hundred to\r\ntwo hundred cuttings may conveniently be put in each bundle, according\r\nto the size of the cuttings.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Care of Cuttings._--After the cuttings are made and bundled, they\r\nshould be labeled with wooden labels and immediately taken to some place\r\nwhere they can be heeled in. The lead-pencil is the best for writing the\r\nnames. The best place in which to heel in the cuttings is on the north\r\nside of some large building, under an open shed or under some large\r\ntrees. In fact, any place which is partially shaded and cool will do. If\r\nthe bundles are to be used soon or shipped, they might be placed on the\r\nwet ground, and only covered with sacks or with straw, but, if they are\r\nto remain any longer time, they must be placed in the ground and\r\ncarefully covered. A trench should be dug half the depth of the cutting,\r\nbut slightly wider. The bundles are placed in the trench upright, and\r\nafter the trench is full the soil from the new trench, parallel with the\r\nfirst one, is thrown on and around the bundles so as to keep them moist.\r\nIt is best not to keep the cuttings too moist, and on no account should\r\nthey be wet, as they will then begin to root rapidly, and when they are\r\nagain removed these roots will break or dry up to the great injury of\r\nthe cutting. If unavoidably the planting is delayed longer than\r\nexpected, the bundles of cuttings may be taken out and placed in dry air\r\nfor a day or for a few hours, and then replaced in the soil. This may be\r\ndone several times without any injury accruing to the cuttings, the only\r\neffect of the drying being to retard their rooting and sprouting, but it\r\nshould of course not be done after they have once begun to callus or\r\nroot. To place cuttings in water for any length of time is nearly always\r\ninjurious, and especially so if the water is bad or contains manure.\r\nManure water always kills cuttings readily. If the cuttings have\r\nsprouted, or begun to make roots, or form callus, a careful vineyardist\r\nwill take his bundles to the field submerged in a barrel or bucket of\r\nwater, or at least wrapped in wet sacks or blankets. If again the\r\ncuttings are dry and a fresh cut does not show a flow of sap, they may\r\nbe freshened by soaking in fresh water over night. Even very poor and\r\ndry cuttings are easily revived this way, but a continuous immersion for\r\nseveral days will injure the cuttings and cause them to rot. It is also\r\nof importance that the water should be clear and cold, or at least not\r\nwarm. Instead of immersing the cuttings in water, they may be set down\r\nin cool and moist soil for three or four days before being planted. The\r\nsoaking in water is the simplest, quickest and most effective for\r\nslightly dried cuttings.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Planting Cuttings._--Planting cuttings in the vineyard can be done in\r\nseveral different ways. They may be planted with a spade, with a flat\r\nplanting bar, or with the “sheep’s-foot.” Each one of these tools will\r\nanswer the purpose if properly used, but their selection must depend\r\nupon the quality of the soil, and upon the nature of the land generally.\r\nIn all planting of cuttings, the following points must be observed as of\r\nimportance in insuring success. The cuttings must be set in moist and\r\ncool soil. The lower end of the cuttings must lodge in solid ground, and\r\nthere must be no air space at the bottom. Only one eye should be left\r\nabove the surface of the soil. The soil must be tamped well around the\r\ncutting from the bottom to the top. All inferior cuttings should be\r\nthrown away, and every cutting should be examined before it is planted.\r\n\r\nFor a description of the tools used in planting, I beg to refer to the\r\nend of this chapter. I will now further consider the above points. Many\r\nfailures are made by not planting in moist soil. If irrigation is\r\nneeded, irrigate before planting, then plow and harrow, and then plant.\r\nWhen moist cuttings are planted in dry and warm soil, the latter will\r\nextract all the moisture from the cuttings, and the latter will fail to\r\ngrow. I have seen parties first plow deep furrows through the vineyard,\r\nso as to air and dry the ground before planting the cuttings. This is\r\nnot necessary and even harmful. Moist and warm ground is essential to\r\nthe starting and growth of cuttings. The lower end of the cutting should\r\nbe lodged in solid ground, or the cutting will fail to grow. This point\r\nis of the utmost importance, and should be carefully observed. If, when\r\nthe cutting is pushed down in the soil, a small air chamber form at the\r\nlower end, the butt end of the cutting will mold, and the latter will be\r\npoisoned and die. Nine-tenths of all the failures in planting are caused\r\nby neglect in this respect. Care is especially needed when the\r\nsheep’s-foot is used. Only one eye should be left above ground, which is\r\nenough for all purposes. Any more eyes will exhaust the cutting before\r\nit is rooted, and the additional length of the cutting will expose it to\r\nthe danger of being broken or otherwise injured. The soil must be tamped\r\nhard all along the cutting so as to cause the latter to attract the\r\nnecessary moisture. Loosely set cuttings very often fail, especially in\r\ndry seasons. All inferior cuttings, especially those frosted or\r\notherwise injured, should be thrown out before being brought to the\r\nfield. A cutting costs so little that it pays to use only the strongest\r\nand best, when a much better stand will be the result. Frosted cuttings\r\ncan be detected by their darker color. Fresh and healthy cuttings should\r\nhave a green and fresh cambium or inner bark, and a fresh cut should\r\nshow fresh sap oozing out.\r\n\r\nWhen the sheep’s-foot is used in planting, the butt end of the cutting\r\nis inserted in the forked end of this tool, and this explains why it is\r\nnecessary to have as little wood as possible below the last eye of the\r\ncutting. By pushing the sheep’s-foot down in the soil, the cutting is\r\npushed simultaneously down to the proper length; a twist is then given\r\nthe sheep’s-foot so as to get it loose from the cutting, and the former\r\nis then pulled up. It may in some instances be necessary to push down\r\nthe cutting with the left hand, while the sheep’s-foot is being pulled\r\nback, as care must be taken that in pulling back the sheep’s-foot the\r\ncutting is not lifted. Even the smallest lift will cause the lower end\r\nof the cutting to hang in an air chamber, and this will, as I have\r\nstated, cause the cutting to mold and die. When planted, a few sharp\r\ntaps with the foot will sufficiently fix the cutting. When the flat bar\r\nis used, a hole is first made by the bar, the cutting is then inserted,\r\nand the hole filled up by again inserting the bar near the cutting, and\r\nby pressing it forward towards the latter. Neither of these tools can be\r\nused in dry or stony soils, but in moist and loamy soil, which has been\r\npreviously well prepared, they are most excellent, as doing the work\r\nboth quickly and well. The sheep’s-foot is unexcelled for speed in loose\r\nsoil, while the flat bar is of advantage where the soil is a little\r\nharder. The flat spade is used when rocky and stony or even gravelly\r\nsoil interferes with the using of the former tools. Every farmer will\r\nknow how to use the spade, and no further explanation is required here.\r\n\r\nSome plant the cuttings slantingly in the soil, in order to bring them\r\nas near the surface as possible. This is well enough and proper in very\r\nwet soils, where the lower strata are too cool, but in this warm country\r\nthe perpendicular planting is easier and better. By twisting and bending\r\nthe cutting in the dug hole a longer cutting can be used, but I have\r\nseldom found any advantage of very long cuttings, and few soils are\r\nsuited to raisin grapes when such methods are needed to produce strong\r\nand rapidly growing vines.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Care of Young Cuttings._--In places where irrigation is needed and\r\nused, many irrigate the cuttings immediately after they are planted, so\r\nas to settle the soil. This, however, is only needed where the ground is\r\nvery dry or very sandy. It is much the better way to irrigate before\r\nplanting and to plant on the loose soil after it has been replowed and\r\nproperly prepared. Such soil keeps the moisture for a long time, and\r\neven in dry climates will require no irrigation for months after the\r\nplanting. The principal care, after the cuttings have been planted, but\r\nbefore they are fairly started, is to keep the ground loose and to\r\nprevent it from baking on the surface. The best way to accomplish this\r\nis to run a revolving randel harrow over the land regardless of the\r\ncuttings. This kind of harrow consists of a row of vertical, slightly\r\nconcave steel discs, which revolve when the harrow is pulled over the\r\nland. No regard need be paid to the rows of cuttings, provided they do\r\nnot stand too high above the surface, or have begun to swell. Not one\r\ncutting in a hundred is injured, and those that are cut off are sure to\r\nsprout from below. After every shower of rain, the land should be\r\nharrowed or pulverized in this way. If the soil is baked and hard around\r\nthe cuttings, the latter will be slow to start, but a loosening of the\r\nsoil will have the desired effect almost immediately. The amount of\r\nirrigation needed for young plantations can only be decided upon on the\r\nground. The cuttings should be kept growing, and young leaves should\r\nalways be seen at the tips of the branches. Long before these young\r\nleaves cease growing, a copious supply of water should be added to keep\r\nthe soil from becoming too dry.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Transporting Cuttings to Distant Parts._--When cuttings are to be\r\nshipped any distance, they must be packed. The simplest method of\r\npacking for short distances is to fill the bottom of a sack with wet\r\nstraw, and then slip the bundle of cuttings down in the sack, and a\r\nsingle string will then suffice to secure the sack to the bundle. Packed\r\nthis way, cuttings can stand a voyage of a week or more if the weather\r\nis not too hot. If a longer voyage, of say several weeks’ duration, is\r\nnecessary, the cuttings should be packed in dry-goods boxes, and, if the\r\ntime of transit is not too long, no other packing is needed. If,\r\nhowever, a very long transit is in view, more precautions for the safe\r\narrival of the cuttings are required. After the bundles have been\r\npressed down in the box, moist and fresh moss is packed tightly down all\r\nalong the sides of the box. Such packing will keep the cuttings fresh\r\nfor over a month. For a longer time, coarse, pulverized charcoal filled\r\nin between the cuttings is a splendid packing. The charcoal must be dry,\r\nthe moisture in the cuttings being enough to keep them alive for several\r\nmonths. Packed first in tin boxes surrounded by charcoal, and then the\r\nboxes soldered tightly, so as to allow no air to enter, is the safest\r\nmethod for transporting cuttings long distances. If there is a\r\npossibility to repack at certain stations on the road, wooden boxes may\r\nbe used instead of tin. The waxing of the ends of the cuttings will help\r\nto keep them moist. All lumber boxes should be lined with waxed paper,\r\nand all cracks carefully nailed up, as by the drying of the boards the\r\ncontents are very liable to run out. Large and heavy boxes should be\r\nsurrounded by iron bands.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rooting Cuttings._--There are two ways of planting cuttings in the\r\nnursery in order to have them rooted for next season’s planting. One way\r\nis to plant in nursery rows four feet apart; the other is to set in\r\nbeds. For such nursery, a plat of land with rich soil and with good\r\nwater facilities should be selected. Water should never fail in the\r\nnursery, as cuttings always require more water than old plants set\r\nfarther apart. The rows should be staked out four feet from each other.\r\nSix or eight inch cuttings should be used, according to the depth to\r\nmoisture; the more moisture, the shorter need be the cuttings. With a\r\nbig, flat hoe the soil along the line of the row is thrown up on one\r\nside, the cuttings are set down upright close to the perpendicular\r\nside, and the soil is again raked back with the same kind of hoe, and\r\nthen tamped hard around the cuttings. The latter need not be over two or\r\nthree inches apart, and from forty to fifty thousand may be set on one\r\nacre of ground. In no instance should the cutting be left more than one\r\nor two inches above the surface of the ground. The best instrument or\r\ntool for opening the soil and for covering the cuttings is the large\r\nflat-faced Italian hoe, used by Italian workmen both in Europe and in\r\nthis country.\r\n\r\nIf the bed system is adopted, much smaller cuttings may be used,\r\nalthough it is not necessary to have them smaller than six inches. The\r\nbeds may be two feet wide and four feet apart, in this respect\r\nresembling nursery rows, and treated just as such. The cuttings are set\r\nin the beds two or three inches apart each way. We must remember that\r\nsuch cuttings require much more water than cuttings planted in four-foot\r\nrows, as the quantity soon exhausts the moisture in the soil. The beds\r\nmay also be square, each one surrounded by a little bank or levee of\r\nsoil in order to hold the water. In these beds, which should be slightly\r\nbelow the general surface of the ground, the cuttings are set very\r\nclose,--two or three inches apart,--until the whole bed is filled up.\r\nThese beds are never cultivated in any other way than by pulling the\r\nweeds out by hand. They must be frequently irrigated by flooding, except\r\nwhen the soil is immensely wet or moist.\r\n\r\nVines may also be propagated from a single eye, or from cuttings\r\ncontaining a single eye. Such cuttings may be set perpendicularly in\r\nbeds or in rows, or they may be placed horizontally in boxes with pure\r\nsand, and entirely covered over. The single eyes soon sprout and make\r\nnice little plants, with a well-developed system of roots.\r\n\r\nAll these cuttings planted in beds, if properly watered during the\r\nsummer, will make excellent vines to be set in vineyard form next\r\nseason. Being set so close, they require much moisture and irrigation,\r\nthe many new roots soon exhausting the moisture in the soil. It is\r\nbetter, however, to have the cuttings set as closely as possible, so as\r\nnot to get too strong vines. An overgrown vine is more expensive to\r\nplant and more difficult to handle than one of medium growth. Besides,\r\nthe latter has a greater number of fibrous roots, which, if in good\r\ncondition, will give a quick start and rapid growth to the new vine.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Care of Rooted Vines._--The same precautions are to be observed with\r\nrooted vines as with cuttings, only more care is required to shield the\r\nroots from the sun and wind. Wet blankets or sacks should always be used\r\nwhen the roots are taken to the field, and, if the vines show the least\r\nsign of being dry, they should be soaked for several hours in pure\r\nwater, and in this respect treated just like cuttings.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Planting Rooted Vines._--Planting rooted vines is not attended with\r\nmany difficulties. The most important points to observe are these. The\r\nvines must be freshly dug. If not, or if the least dry, soak in water\r\nover night. Cut away all dead or dry rootlets. Prune the top of the vine\r\ndown to two or three buds, and leave only one spur. Have the vines\r\ncovered while carried out in the field, and plant only in moist ground.\r\nThe young and tender roots are easily dried if set in warm and dry\r\nsoil, and they will afterwards decay and injure the vine. A carefully\r\nplanted vineyard, where rooted vines alone have been used, and where\r\nevery precaution has been taken to insure success, should have about\r\nninety-seven per cent of the vines growing. To make every one grow would\r\nonly be possible in a very small plantation. In the large raisin\r\ncenters, all this planting may be contracted for. The cost of planting\r\ncuttings is generally calculated at one-half cent per cutting, and for\r\nrooted vines at one cent per vine. Frequently parties contract to supply\r\ncuttings and to plant the land for from eighteen to twenty dollars per\r\nacre or less. It is generally better to pay the higher price and get the\r\nwork done properly.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Proper Time for Planting._--The time for planting cuttings depends\r\ngreatly upon the season, the quality of the soil and the moisture. In\r\nwet seasons the dry land should be planted first, and cuttings might be\r\nstarted there as soon as the first frost allows us to make them with\r\nadvantage. The moister the soil the later should the planting be begun,\r\nand on the contrary the drier the soil and the warmer, the sooner should\r\nthe cuttings as well as the rooted vines be planted in the fall.\r\nDecember and January are the best months to plant, although with care\r\ncuttings as well as rooted vines may be set as late as in April or even\r\nin May. As a rule, early planting is better, as it gives the cuttings\r\nchance to root well before the hot weather causes the shoots to start.\r\nIn very rainy seasons, or in wet places, cuttings should be planted\r\nlater than rooted vines. Moisture in undue degree will cause cuttings to\r\nrot, while its influence on the roots of the vines is not as great.\r\nRooted vines stand both moisture and drought better than cuttings do. On\r\nsandy, dry soil and in dry seasons I would wish my cuttings planted as\r\nearly in December as possible; while, on wet places, I would delay\r\nplanting until after the frost is over in February. The same rule\r\napplies to rooted vines, but we must remember that roots begin to send\r\nout rootlets almost as soon as they are dug, and that early planting\r\nwill preserve these for the early use of the vine, while, in late\r\nplanting, almost every one of these new roots will be destroyed in\r\nplanting and must be produced over again. We might also say that both\r\ncuttings and rooted vines should be set as soon as the soil is in proper\r\ncondition in the fall. Do not wait for anything after the soil is dry\r\nenough to permit planting. Early planted vines will have a good start.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cost of Cuttings and Rooted Vines._--The price of Muscat or\r\nraisin-grape cuttings generally varies from two dollars and fifty cents\r\nto five dollars per thousand, and have been sold as low as one dollar\r\nper thousand cuttings. Rooted vines again vary from ten to twenty\r\ndollars per thousand, according to the demand and supply. The cost of\r\nplanting is, of course, different in different localities. In Fresno the\r\nruling prices for vineyard planting with cuttings is one-half cent per\r\ncutting. The men board and lodge themselves for this sum. For rooted\r\nvines the price is from sixty cents to one dollar per hundred vines. The\r\nground must be in a perfect condition, but the success of the work is\r\nnever guaranteed, as so much depends upon after treatment. While the\r\nactual cost of planting the grapes is insignificant, it will be found\r\nthat the many different expenses of a large vineyard of say 160 acres\r\nwill be quite considerable, and few of our larger raisin vineyards in\r\nirrigated districts have cost less than fifty dollars per acre during\r\nthe first year. This includes labor, buildings, tools, etc., but not the\r\nfirst cost of land. With experience and constant supervision, this cost\r\nmay be reduced somewhat, and under very favorable circumstances from\r\ntwenty to forty dollars even per acre may cover the cost of planting and\r\nmaintenance during the first season. But estimates in this direction are\r\nnot reliable, as one man will spend twice as much as another under\r\nsimilar circumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLOWING AND CULTIVATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Winter Plowing._--The plowing and cultivation of a vineyard comprise\r\ndifferent operations, both in the spring, winter and summer. Winter\r\nplowing should begin as soon as the vines are pruned, and should be\r\nfinished before the buds begin to swell in the spring. The plowing\r\nshould begin with a large plow and two horses, and the soil should be\r\nthrown from the vines towards the center of the land between them. As\r\nsuch a large plow cannot go too near the vines without breaking branches\r\nand injuring the buds, a smaller single-horse plow is used to follow\r\nafter the double team, and to finish up by plowing a furrow nearest to\r\nthe vines. The depth of this plowing should, if possible, be from six to\r\neight inches in the center of the row, and from four to six inches\r\nnearest to the vines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Vineyard Double Plow.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Plowing Devices._--To enable the single plow to run as closely to the\r\nvines as possible without injury to the vines, several devices are used.\r\nThe block device consists of inserting a block of wood two inches wide\r\nbetween the center of the clevis and the plow-beam. This throws the\r\nsingletree out to one side and enables the horse to walk at a distance\r\nfrom the vine, while the plow follows as close to the latter as\r\npossible. In combination with this block, the singletrees should be so\r\nconstructed as not to catch the branches of the vines. This is best\r\naccomplished by attaching to the outside end of the singletree a flat,\r\ndoubled leather strap, to which is fixed a common, large snap, in which\r\nlatter the traces of the harness are fixed. Such a singletree will\r\nglide by the branches without giving them a chance to catch anywhere.\r\nSimilar singletrees, or even doubletrees, should be used wherever\r\nvineyard work is to be done, and they have the double advantage of being\r\ncheap, practical and easily made by any farmhand handy with tools.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cultivation._--The cultivation should always follow the plowing\r\nimmediately, so as to prevent the soil from baking, and so as to tear up\r\nthe roots of the weeds which have been partially dislodged. The first\r\ncultivation, which should always be in the same direction as the\r\nplowing, should be followed by cross-cultivation. The latter brings the\r\nsoil back towards the vines, filling up the hollow formed by the\r\nthrowing of the soil from the vines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Raisin Vineyard Diamond-tooth Cultivator.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Back-furrowing._--Later on, when the weeds have to some extent decayed,\r\na double-shovel plow is by some growers used for turning a part of the\r\nsoil back towards the vines. One round of this plow on each side of the\r\nvines is all that is required, as the repeated cultivation that should\r\nbe carried on in a vineyard will generally suffice to bring the balance\r\nof the soil back from the center of the land towards the vines.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cross-plowing._--Cross-plowing is not absolutely needed, and in many\r\nplaces not even possible, as where the vines are planted closer one way\r\nthan the other. But wherever plowing can be done both ways, the land\r\nwill be benefited by being plowed one way one year and the other way the\r\nnext year, so that in course of time all the soil will be regularly\r\nbroken up. When there is plenty of time and enough labor, cross-plowing\r\nthe same season will greatly benefit the vines.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Weed-cutters._--These are used to great advantage after the first\r\nplowing, and any cultivator may be rigged with one of them, or they may\r\nbe made as separate tools. The cutter-bar is simply a flat bar, which is\r\nbent in the shape of a very wide U, and is fastened to the beams of the\r\ncultivator just behind the last shovels or blades. The horizontal part\r\nof this cutter-knife should be on the same level as the center of the\r\ncultivator blades, and stand as horizontal as possible, in order to be\r\nsubjected to the least amount of friction. The effect of such cultivator\r\ncutters are that no growing weeds are left behind wherever they pass.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cutter-sled._--I have used with great advantage a combination of this\r\ncutter-knife and a sled, upon which the driver could stand and ride, and\r\nits use saved time, besides doing the required work well. Such a\r\ncutter-sled is, however, only useful in already well plowed and\r\ncultivated soil, and for summer work it is just the thing and can then\r\nnot be surpassed by any other weed-cutting tool which I have ever seen\r\nused.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Raisin Vineyard Weed-cutter.]\r\n\r\nVarious other tools are used, and different ones at that in each\r\nseparate district. Each grower has his particular way to cultivate and\r\nplow, and not two vineyardists do the work alike. Each one has his\r\nfavorite tools and instruments, which he often changes from year to year\r\nor replaces by new inventions of local mechanics or inventors. A\r\ndescription of these tools and the various methods of plowing,\r\ncultivating and bringing the land in proper condition would make a book\r\nof itself and would be merely a history of each individual vineyard in\r\nthe land. An enumeration of them will be found later on.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of the vineyard should be continued as long as it can be\r\ndone without causing injury to the new growth of the vines. The exact\r\nnumber of times the vines should be cultivated is impossible to decide\r\nupon beforehand, as almost every vineyard requires a different method of\r\nworking. It is safe to say that during the summer no weeds should be\r\nallowed to grow in the vineyard, and, as long as any of them are left,\r\nthe soil should, if possible, be cultivated. Every weed acts like a\r\nchimney for the moisture in the soil, which it sucks out to the\r\ndetriment of the vine, while weeds which grow in among the branches of\r\nthe vines will also seriously interfere with the picking of the grapes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Riverside: City, Orchards and Vineyards.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hoeing._--Only little manual cultivation is needed. In the spring,\r\nafter the first plowing and before the buds have started or have grown\r\nlong enough to interfere with the work, the vines should be hoed. The\r\nobject of hoeing is to loosen the soil nearest the vines, and to destroy\r\nall the weeds which cannot be turned under by the plow, and especially\r\nthose which grow close to the vines. The best tool for this purpose is\r\nthe common, heavy hoe with a long handle. A very useful hoe can be made\r\nof old shovels which are so worn and broken that they cannot be longer\r\nused for digging. The blade of the shovel is fixed to a new handle at a\r\nright angle, similar to a hoe handle, while the blade itself is left as\r\nit is. Such hoes are very useful in cutting heavy weeds, and work with\r\ngreat facility. Forked hoes are used by many vineyardmen, especially for\r\nstirring the hardened crust around the vine, but I believe the common,\r\nheavy hoe a more useful instrument, and if used in time will make the\r\nforked hoe unnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Time for Cultivation._--Too early plowing or cultivation before the\r\nweeds have started is not always desirable, as it prevents the weeds\r\nfrom growing. Such weeds, if turned under, will yearly enrich the land,\r\nand in course of time form a heavy and humus-rich top soil, which will\r\nserve to keep the moisture in the soil below. I therefore advocate\r\nplowing as late as possible. The exact time must be decided for every\r\nparticular season and for every separate locality, and no general rule\r\ncan be given. Wet lands should be plowed earlier than dry lands; it is\r\nthe latter which especially require the green weeds to be turned under,\r\nand which will be the most benefited by the accumulation of humus. Our\r\nvineyardists disregard this fact too much, and are generally too apt to\r\nplow their dryest lands first.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRAFTING THE MUSCAT ON OTHER STOCKS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Time for Grafting Raisin-vines._--The best time for grafting\r\ngrapevines, as well as for grafting anything else, is when the stock on\r\nwhich we graft has its sap in circulation, and when the scions or\r\ncuttings which we are to insert in the stock are yet dormant. This time\r\noccurs from the middle of January, when the sap first rises in the old\r\nvine, and continues to March or even April, February and March being\r\ngenerally the months best suited to the work. Grafting may also be done\r\nin the fall of the year after the grape crop has been gathered, while\r\nsome growers have best succeeded still earlier, and advocate the month\r\nof August as being the most favorable time for this process. The sap at\r\nthat time ceases flowing, and there is no danger of its being clogged.\r\nGrapevines can be grafted at almost any time of the year at which the\r\nweather is not too warm, as this will cause the cuttings to bud out\r\nbefore they have joined the stock. If grafting on resistant stocks is\r\ndesired, the stocks, if small, must first be dug, and the grafting can\r\nthen be performed in the workshop any time between December and March,\r\nthe early winter months being preferable.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Points to be Observed in Grafting._--The main object in grafting is to\r\nproperly join the scions and the stock. The point of junction should be\r\nthe cambium layer, or what is commonly called the inner bark. If a\r\ncutting of a vine is cut off smoothly and placed in the ground, the\r\ncallus soon begins to form at the lower end. This callus, which is seen\r\nto exude from the green layer between the hard wood and the bark, is fed\r\nby the sap in the cutting descending through the cambium layer and\r\nforming new cells at its free end. If this callus joins a similar callus\r\nof the cambium or green layer of the stock, the two calluses unite and\r\nform together a new vine, in which the top consists of the new scion and\r\nthe root of the old vine. The junction of the two is the place where the\r\ncambium surface of the scion met the cambium of the stock. In the\r\nscions, the cambium lies very close to the exterior layer of the\r\ncutting, the bark here being very thin, while in the old stock the\r\ncambium is situated many times deeper in, the outer layer or the bark\r\nbeing very thick. It is not necessary that the cambium layers of the two\r\nshould meet or join all along the cut surface, and a few points of\r\ncontact and junction is sufficient, although it is better to have as\r\nlarge a junction surface as possible. If the two cambium layers do not\r\nmeet, the scion will not grow, or, as it is called, take. The scions\r\nmust be dormant when being grafted, and, if their buds have begun to\r\nswell, they will probably not take, or at least success is less certain.\r\nIn order to keep them dormant they should be cut early in winter, and\r\nthen be buried in cool and only slightly moist earth, either in a cellar\r\nor on the north side of a house, where the sun and heat will not strike\r\nthem and cause them to start their buds. If the callus should form, or\r\neven root, the callus and roots may be cut away without great injury to\r\nthe cuttings. If the cuttings are dry, they should be soaked for a few\r\nhours in tepid water, and afterwards buried in moist sand. This\r\ntreatment is often useful for imported cuttings which have been injured\r\nin transit. They often recover vigor wonderfully fast, and should never\r\nbe given up for lost as long as there is any green-colored cambium left,\r\nin which the sap may again be brought into circulation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Various Methods of Grafting._--The general way to graft is to graft on\r\nold stocks. Vines of one variety are thus changed into the variety we\r\nwish to grow, and from which the scions are taken. The first step is to\r\ndig away the soil from the vines down to the first roots, which should\r\nbe done by a separate gang of men. Next the stocks are sawed off\r\nhorizontally at the first roots, or say from four to six inches below\r\nthe surface of the soil. This should also be done by separate hands so\r\nas to insure rapidity and skill in the work. Some grafters saw off the\r\nstocks somewhat slanting, so as to cause them to shed the sap which\r\nalways exudes from the stump. Next in order comes the splitting of the\r\nwood of the stock and the insertion of the grafts. This requires care\r\nand skill, and should not be done by careless hands.\r\n\r\nThe splitting of the stock is done in several different ways, and to\r\naccomplish it we can either use a knife and a wooden mallet or a\r\nhand-saw. If the former is used, the knife must be sharp and thick, so\r\nas to stand the blows of the mallet. Some growers even use a sharp\r\nchisel. If a saw is the tool used,--and I prefer it every time,--the\r\nedges of the old wood should afterwards be pared off smoothly with a\r\nsharp knife, so as to leave no rough marks of the teeth of the saw. The\r\nstock is split straight across, as in the cleft graft, and one scion is\r\nthen inserted at each end of the cleft on opposite sides of the stock;\r\nor the stock is split on one side only, care being taken that the cleft\r\ndoes not extend across the stump, and in this cleft a scion is carefully\r\nfitted as before; or a wedge-shaped piece may be sawed out or cut out of\r\nthe stock, and of the size that can be fitted by a scion. It makes but\r\nlittle difference what method is used, as with ordinary care and skill\r\nthe scions will take quite readily. Even if they should entirely fail,\r\nthe same stocks may be grafted over next fall or next year, as they keep\r\ntheir vitality almost unimpaired for years after they are cut. It is\r\nonly necessary to saw them off until fresh wood is reached.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Simple Lateral Cleft Graft, 1_a._ Splitting the Trunk,\r\n1_b._ The Scion, 1_c._ The Beveled End of the Latter, 1_d._ Scion and\r\nStock Joined.\r\n\r\n2.

They should never be longer than\r\nsufficient to have one eye above the surface of the soil, two or three\r\neyes to the scion being generally enough. The cuttings are first cut in\r\nsufficient lengths in the field, or on the spot, and there pared to fit\r\nthe cleft in the stock. If prepared in the house, they are apt to dry\r\nout and become ruined. By keeping them in water they may be kept fresh,\r\nbut this greatly injures their quality. The best way is to bring the\r\ncuttings out to the vineyard wrapped up in wet sacks, and to cut and\r\npare them on the spot where they are to be grafted. With a sharp knife\r\nthe two opposite sides of the scions are pared off tapering, but not\r\nnecessarily to a fine point. The scion is then fitted in the cleft, a\r\nsmall wooden wedge being useful for holding the latter open while the\r\nscion is fitted. If the stock closes tightly upon the graft, no tying is\r\nrequired, but, if the grip of the stock is not sufficient, tying is\r\nneeded. Cotton cloth, manilla rope or anything that will hold the two\r\ntogether will answer the purpose. The stocks and scions will both dry\r\nslightly, and the tying should therefore be secure and tight.\r\n\r\nA piece of bark of the vine is next placed over the cleft, so as to\r\nprevent any soil from falling in the cleft, and very careful grafters\r\nuse a paste made of a mixture of two parts of adobe or clay and one part\r\nof cowdung, for covering both the cleft and the sides of the grafts\r\noutside of the tying. A stout stake is driven in the ground close to the\r\ngraft, and the two tied together in order that the graft may not give or\r\nbe disturbed in the least. The hole is next filled with soil, which\r\nshould be packed tightly and heaped above the scion, thus forming a\r\nsmall mound above the ground all around the graft. The soil should not\r\nbe disturbed until the new shoots are well above the ground and have\r\nbegun to harden their wood, at which time the security of the graft is\r\nfully assured. One or more of the grafts may be left growing for the\r\nfirst year, and later on all except one graft are cut off so as to give\r\nthe vine only one trunk.\r\n\r\nIn grafting on resistant stocks, the latter generally being smaller then\r\nold stocks, a different graft may be used, such as the whip graft. This\r\ngraft should be above or at least near the top of the ground in order to\r\nprevent the scion from taking root, the latter’s roots not being\r\nresistant to the phylloxera. Such grafts should be carefully covered\r\nwith the clay mixture, and soil should be heaped up over their tops. To\r\nprevent the scions from drying out, their tops may also be covered with\r\ngrafting wax.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Stocks and Their Influence._--The old stock has a decided influence on\r\nthe scion and the new vine. Which stock is the best on which to graft\r\nthe Muscat has not yet been determined, but we may presume that any\r\nstrong and healthy growing variety will answer our purpose. During the\r\nfirst year, and also during the second year, in many instances the new\r\nvine assumes a character half way between that of an old-stock variety\r\nand that of the variety of the scions. Thus I have seen Muscats grafted\r\non Sultanas and Zinfandels which were almost identical with these\r\nvarieties. If I had not positively known that they were the tops\r\nproduced from Muscat scions, I would never have believed them to be\r\nanything else than suckers from the old stocks. The leaves, berries and\r\nbranches of these Muscats were the first year exactly like Sultanas. The\r\nberries of those grafted on black grapes were, however, in this\r\ninstance, not black but white, but I have heard of other instances in\r\nwhich they were partially colored. Some vines, again, showed\r\ncharacteristics of both varieties, the leaves generally being similar to\r\nthe old stock, while the grapes showed the characteristics of the\r\nMuscats. This bastardity, however, wears off in a year or two, and\r\nfinally the vine assumes the full characteristics of the scion variety.\r\nWhen this takes place it is evident that the sap of the scion or the top\r\nof the vine has either changed the root, or through its quantity\r\noverpowered the effects of the root-sap.\r\n\r\nMuscats grafted on Malagas, Feher Szagos, Sultanas and Zinfandels all do\r\nwell in time, and in many instances bear even better than Muscats on\r\ntheir own roots. Our experience in grafting the Muscat is, however,\r\nlimited, and we do not know with any certainty which roots are the most\r\nfavorable or the most unfavorable on which to graft the Muscat grape. I\r\nhave seen grafted Muscats on wine stocks which did not do well as\r\nregards bearing, while the growth of the vines was rather vigorous.\r\nThese varieties mentioned above are, however, suitable stocks for Muscat\r\ngrafts. I learn from Mr. R. C. Kells of Yuba City that the late Dr. S.\r\nR. Chandler of the same locality cleared the third year seventy-five\r\ndollars per acre from Muscats grafted on Mission vines. This must be\r\nconsidered as very successful, especially as I have heard of other\r\ninstances where similar grafts did not bear sufficiently the third year\r\nto pay for the labor of caring for the vineyard work that year.\r\n\r\n\r\nVARIOUS SUMMER WORK.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sulphuring._--Sulphuring the vines is now considered a most necessary\r\noperation, and without doing it well and in time no good crops can be\r\nrelied upon. It is true that good crops of grapes are sometimes had\r\nwithout sulphuring, but this is only due to chance; the absence of\r\nmildew, and immunity from disease of unsulphured vines are rare, even in\r\notherwise most perfectly kept vineyards.\r\n\r\nThe sulphuring consists in thoroughly dusting the growing vines, leaves,\r\nbranches, flower buds and berries with powdered sulphur. The first\r\nsulphuring must be done when the grapevines leaf out in the spring, and,\r\nwhen the young shoots are about six inches long, it is about time to\r\ncommence. Many growers sulphur only once, some go over their vines two\r\ntimes, but our most successful growers,--those who get the best and\r\nlargest fruit crop of grapes and bunches,--sulphur in unfavorable\r\nseasons three or four times. The second sulphuring is done just before\r\nthe blossoms open, and may even, provided the weather remains cool and\r\nwindy, be done in the open blossoms with great benefit to the setting\r\nberries. Miss M. F. Austin of Fresno was the first to successfully\r\nsulphur in the open blossom, the result being very large crops. But not\r\nall have been as successful as she, and one of our most experienced\r\nvineyardists and raisin-growers, T. C. White, prefers to sulphur just\r\nbefore the blossom opens, as, in case of very warm weather when the\r\nsulphur is thrown on the blossom, the latter is apt to blast. We are\r\ntherefore on the safe side if we sulphur just before the buds have\r\nopened, and after the grapes have set. But on cold, windy days when one\r\nof the cold electric northwest winds are sweeping down the valleys,\r\nsulphuring must be done whether the blossom is open or not, as it is\r\njust at this time the sulphur is required the most, in order to\r\ncounteract the formation of the first stage of the powdery mildew. The\r\nvapor of the sulphur destroys the germs of the mildew, and thus prevents\r\nthe latter from causing the grapes to fall off. After the grapes have\r\nfully set, no further sulphuring is required except in the case of heavy\r\nrains or in continued cloudy weather, when there is always danger that\r\nthe mildew will reappear. If heavy rains should occur during the summer,\r\na renewed sulphuring is always necessary or at least advisable, but in\r\nordinary seasons no sulphuring is needed after the berries have set\r\nwell, as the germs of the mildew are then sufficiently injured to not\r\ndevelop later in the season.\r\n\r\nSufficient sulphuring is always noticeable in the vineyard by its smell,\r\nand, when this smell is strong and pronounced, no further sulphuring is\r\nrequired. The sulphur is applied to the vines either by the “dredger”\r\n(or dust-can) or by a pair of sulphur bellows. The dredger is used when\r\nthe vines are small, while the bellows are necessary to spread the\r\nsulphur evenly when the vines have reached a certain size. Many growers\r\nuse, during the first sulphuring, small burlap bags filled with sulphur.\r\nThe meshes of the burlaps are large enough to allow the sulphur to go\r\nthrough. The sulphur should be finely pulverized to be effective, and\r\nthe sublimated French sulphur is by many considered the best. The cost\r\nof sulphuring varies according to the size of the vines, but is\r\ngenerally about three dollars per acre. Young vines under three years of\r\nage require little sulphuring, while older vines require a great deal.\r\nAbout ten tons of sulphur will be enough for 160 acres.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tying Over._--The tying over of the branches is another vineyard\r\noperation much used in the interior raisin districts, generally in the\r\nend of June or the middle of July. It consists in so bending and tying\r\nthe long, straggling branches of the vine that they will shade the\r\ngrapes hanging in the center. The long branch is bent, not in a direct\r\nline towards the center, as it would then expose too many of the lower\r\ngrape bunches, but in a spiral direction round the vine. If there is any\r\nfear that the grapes will be exposed and sunburned, and the vines have\r\nnot been properly summer pruned, the tying over is the only process by\r\nwhich great loss can be prevented and the grape crop saved. In tying\r\nover, no twine is used. The end of the long branch is twisted and\r\nfastened to other branches, and, when the grapes are ripe and the\r\npicking season comes, a single light pull will suffice to untie all and\r\nallow the grapes to be picked. Great care should be used in tying over,\r\nlest the lower branches become exposed and sunburned. Careless or\r\ninexperienced laborers will often accomplish a great deal of work and a\r\ngreat deal of harm in an incredibly short time. I have seen vineyards\r\nwhere more harm was done by tying over than by the sun and wind\r\ncombined.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Covering the Vines._--Instead of tying over, many vineyardists now\r\ncover the vines, and place the covers on the open center of the vine, in\r\norder that they may protect the grapes from exposure to the sun. This is\r\ndone in June, several days before the hot spell is expected. The last\r\nweek in June is the best time almost everywhere in California, as the\r\nvines are then open in the center, and any unusually hot weather would\r\neasily cause the grapes to sunburn. The process of covering is very\r\nsimple. With a pair of shears the longest branches are clipped off and\r\nimmediately placed on the open center. This is generally enough to\r\nprevent the exposed grapes in the center of the vine from being scalded.\r\nMore than half a dozen branches will seldom be required, and at picking\r\ntime these dry branches must first be thrown off, so as to give the\r\npicker access to the grapes. The covering of the vines is a better\r\nprocess than tying over, requiring less work and being more quickly\r\nperformed. It is especially useful for old vines, as the grapes of young\r\nvines are principally exposed from the sides.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Thinning the Crop._--The proper thinning of the crop should be done by\r\npruning. If the proper amount of wood is left, no thinning out of the\r\ngrapes is needed. If a few show-grapes or extra large raisins are needed\r\nfor exhibiting purposes, they can be produced by a judicious cutting of\r\nthe majority of the grapes from any single bunch. If the free half of\r\nthe bunch is cut off, the part that is left will produce very large\r\ngrapes. This operation is, however, never likely to enter as a regular\r\nvineyard operation in our vineyards, as with us labor is too scarce. The\r\nobject of our raisin industry is to produce cheap medium-sized raisins\r\nof good quality, to be used by the masses of the people, instead of a\r\nsmaller quantity of very large grapes, which could only be used by the\r\nrich.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ringing the Vines._--This consists in removing a part of the bark all\r\naround a cane. In France and Greece a special instrument is made to\r\nperform this operation quickly and carefully. A ring of bark half an\r\ninch wide is all that is required to have the desired effect. The vines\r\nare ringed when the grapes are half grown, and only a few canes are\r\nringed on each vine. The effect of ringing is to greatly increase the\r\ncrop of grapes, also to produce the grapes earlier in the season. So far\r\nthis process has not been used in California to any extent. In the\r\nGrecian Islands, where currants are raised, this ringing has been\r\npracticed for years, with more or less beneficial effect. The sap in the\r\ncane that is ringed is prevented from again returning to the root, and\r\ngoes to produce a larger quantity of grapes above the ring. But thereby\r\nthe cane is seriously injured, and often to such an extent that it must\r\nbe entirely removed the following season. Care must therefore be taken\r\nto leave enough unringed branches to serve as fruit-bearing wood the\r\nfollowing year. If done with care and good judgment, the ringing does no\r\ngreat injury to the vine. For a fuller account of the process, see\r\narticle on Currants.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Vineyard Labors of the Year._--The following synopsis of the\r\nvarious labors in a raisin vineyard can only be of interest to the\r\nbeginner, or to any one who contemplates engaging in the raisin\r\nbusiness. The data given are only approximate, as they must differ in\r\ndifferent localities, or according to the changing of the seasons:\r\n\r\n\r\n_December._--After the first frost, or when the vines are dormant,\r\nplanting new vines and cuttings may begin.

New land should be prepared for\r\nplanting, which should begin as soon as the first frost has killed the\r\nleaves of the vine.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRUNING.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Winter Pruning, or Pruning Hard Wood._--The pruning of vines comprises\r\ntwo different processes. The first one has for its object the shaping of\r\nthe vines, the second one similarly the shortening of the branches\r\nproperly so as to enable them to bear better fruit. These two points\r\nmust always be kept in view, much more so of course during the first few\r\nyears, before the vines have reached their bearing age. But even in\r\nafter years the pruning must be so conducted, that the shape of the vine\r\nis not changed so as to interfere with the work in the field, or with\r\nthe perfect development of the grapes. As regards the shape of the vine,\r\nit has been decided that in our raisin districts the Muscat requires to\r\nbe pruned low, in order to properly protect the grapes from sun and\r\nwind. The head should be as low as possible, or even rest on the ground,\r\nand in no instance be more than a few inches above the same. Many of the\r\nbunches will then rest on the ground or hang a few inches above it, and\r\nexperience shows us that such low bunches are the best and those which\r\nproduce the finest raisins. Tall Muscat vines never produce as sweet and\r\nas large bunches or grapes as those headed low, and their grapes are apt\r\nto sunburn or be otherwise checked in their growth. During the first\r\nyear, the young vine should be cut back to a single stem, it being\r\nenough to leave two or three eyes above the ground. The second season\r\nthese canes should all be cut away except three, which are to form the\r\nfuture head of the vine. Each one of these may be cut to two eyes, thus\r\nleaving six eyes on the vine. In the majority of vines, the head should\r\nby this time have been formed, as the following year will be the first\r\nyear in which the vines will bear.\r\n\r\nWhen Muscat vines have grown two seasons, they should be pruned for\r\nfruit. The third season will always give some fruit, while, in many\r\nlocalities where the vines have been well cared for, the yield may be\r\nquite large and pay handsomely. No direction as to pruning, which will\r\napply to every locality or to every vine, is possible. In different\r\nlocalities the climatic and other conditions are so variable that the\r\nmethods of pruning may be modified. Where the vines grow strong and\r\nvigorous more wood should be left. In cool and sheltered places the\r\nvines should be given a greater spread to allow more sun and air to\r\nenter. In warm localities, with a broiling sun, the principal object in\r\npruning should be to properly shelter the grapes. There is danger, or at\r\nleast there are great disadvantages in pruning either too long or too\r\nshort, and in leaving too many or too few spurs. In pruning too long, or\r\nleaving too many eyes, the shape of the vine is changed or even\r\nseriously injured. In leaving too many spurs, the vines may bear too\r\nmany and too small grapes. To find the medium between these extremes is\r\nalways the great object and study to which the grower should devote his\r\nattention. In rich and moist soils which produce strong vines, more eyes\r\nshould be left, and in sandy, poor soil a few eyes may suffice to cause\r\nthe vine to bear much more that it can properly mature and perfect. The\r\nyear before the vines bear their first good crop, the spurs left should\r\nnot exceed three or four, and each spur should not have more than two\r\neyes, including the eye nearest the old wood, which eye is often\r\noverlooked and not counted in. The next year a few more spurs may be\r\nleft, but at no time should each spur be allowed to carry more than two\r\neyes. If more eyes are left, the lower eyes will not develop, and the\r\nonly thing attained by such pruning is to increase the size of the head,\r\nand to place the leaves and the grapes farther away from the center of\r\nthe vine.\r\n\r\nAt the age of six years, or when the vine is in full bearing, no more\r\nspurs should be added, as the vine has then attained a mature age, and\r\nthe yield will increase independently of an increased number of spurs.\r\nHow many spurs should be left it is not possible to say. The experience\r\nwith most growers is generally that too few spurs are left, and that\r\nfrom ten to fifteen spurs are not too many on large and healthy vines.\r\nThe tendency of the growers is now to leave more spurs than formerly,\r\nand to always restrict the spurs to two eyes each. This experience has\r\nbeen acquired simultaneously in Fresno, San Bernardino and San Diego\r\ncounties. Many growers affirm the fact that the difficulty is to get\r\nspurs enough, and my own experience is that, after the vine has once\r\nattained its age of full bearing, all the strongest branches are\r\nrequired to furnish spurs, and that only the weak and sickly shoots\r\nshould be cut away entirely. The strong flow of sap in the spring\r\nrequires many outlets, so as not to unnecessarily push the cell walls\r\nand cause disorders, and in case the soil is not strong enough to\r\nsustain and perfect so many grapes, it is better to manure it heavily\r\nand make it rich enough for all purposes. I believe an average of from\r\neight to ten spurs are required by strong and bearing vines. Only strong\r\ncanes should be left at any time. Weak and immature canes should be cut\r\noff close to the trunk or to the head.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Muscatel Vine Eight Years Old, after Winter Pruning.]\r\n\r\nThis method of pruning differs materially from that this season adopted\r\nby A. B. Butler. He leaves now only from five to eight spurs on the\r\nvines, generally the lesser number. He maintains that his object is to\r\nproduce large and superior grapes, and not to have his vines overbear.\r\nThe outcome of such close pruning has not yet been demonstrated, but it\r\nmay be possible that this is the proper way. Mr. Butler has certainly\r\none point in his favor, and that is that it has not yet been\r\ndemonstrated that very close pruning causes the disease known as\r\nblack-knot, as quite frequently the unpruned vines show this disease\r\nmuch more than those which are pruned close. Another point in favor of\r\nthis pruning is that it has been practiced in Malaga for years without\r\nany ill effects. But, before such very close pruning can be generally\r\nrecommended, our experience in this direction should be more extensive,\r\nand several years more will be necessary to come to any satisfactory\r\nconclusion in this respect. We know, however, that too many (say from\r\ntwenty to twenty-five) spurs will exhaust the low-headed Muscatel vines,\r\nand in order to bring such vines back to proper bearing it has been\r\nfound necessary to reduce the number of spurs at once to one-third and\r\nthen gradually increase their number as the vines grow stronger. Every\r\ngrower should study his own vines and adapt the number of spurs to the\r\nquality of the crop. If the crop is inferior, reduce the number; if\r\nagain the crop is superior, we may try to gradually give a few more\r\nspurs in order to reach the greatest yield of first-class grapes. In\r\npruning the spurs, the cut should be made a little above the eye or bud,\r\nand not so close to it that it will be injured and dry out.\r\n\r\nSuckers from the roots should be removed to a limited extent, that is,\r\nnow and then a sucker may be left in order to give material for forming\r\na new head, if this should be found necessary. But as a rule the many\r\nsuckers which rise from the roots should be removed in early spring with\r\na sharp-pointed stick, and even those which rise from below the regular\r\nhead should be broken off while young, or be pruned off in winter time.\r\n\r\nAnother system of pruning called the Chaintre system has been\r\nintroduced, or at least spoken of during the last few years. As,\r\nhowever, it is not generally used, or even to my knowledge used at all,\r\nfor raisin grapes, I need only here allude to it. It consists of pruning\r\nthe vine to one single long stem, which is carried along the ground and,\r\nat a distance of six or eight feet from the root, fastened to a stake.\r\nThis branch is pruned to shorter branches and spurs, each of the latter\r\nto one or two eyes each to furnish wood and fruit. The advantages of the\r\nChaintre pruning are claimed to be principally two,--a greater yield of\r\ngrapes and a larger outlet for the abundant sap in the spring. It is\r\nsupposed that, if the vine is pruned too short, the sudden flow of sap\r\nin the spring has a great tendency to poison some of the cells and\r\nvessels of the wood, and cause the disease known as black-knot. The\r\nChaintre system endeavors, by furnishing the vine with more cells and\r\nvessels, and thus a larger outlet for the sap, to overcome this\r\ndifficulty. The Chaintre system has, however, some great inconveniences.\r\nIt interferes considerably with the tillage of the soil. It increases\r\nthe cost of the vineyard through the extra stakes necessary to support\r\nthe vines,--inconveniences so great that I doubt whether the system will\r\never be seriously adopted anywhere on this coast, even if it should\r\nprove of any advantage.\r\n\r\nThe time for the pruning depends upon the season. The only safe rule is\r\nthat vineyards may be pruned as soon as the vines are dormant. If pruned\r\ntoo soon, a new growth will start, which will be killed by the first\r\nfrost. In many seasons the pruning may be done in November and December;\r\nin large vineyards it must be begun early, so as to finish before the\r\nplowing commences. Early pruning will cause the vines to start early in\r\nthe spring, while late pruning will considerably delay the starting of\r\nthe buds. When the spring frosts are to be feared, the pruning may be\r\ndeferred for some months, or until the end of January, as it delays the\r\nbudding out of the vine in the spring, sometimes as much as fourteen\r\ndays. But, on the other hand, the first warm spring weather is so\r\nfavorable to the development of the grapevines and the setting of the\r\nfruit, that every advantage should be taken of the same. The very best\r\ncrops are generally had on early pruned vines.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bleeding of the Vines._--The bleeding of the vines after pruning in the\r\nspring is by many considered injurious. So far as I know, no direct\r\nexperiments to prove this have been made in this country, but European\r\nexperiments with wine grapevines point to no ill effects from the\r\nbleeding of the vines. The bleeding retards the budding out, and this\r\nfact has led some growers to the practice of pruning twice. In the first\r\npruning an extra eye is left on every spur, and these eyes are again\r\nclipped off shortly before the eyes begin to swell in the spring. The\r\nbleeding of the vines thus causes the eyes to be retarded until the\r\nfrost is over. I believe such practice is both unnecessary and too\r\ncostly, and is not required in any of our raisin districts, and where\r\nsuch practice must be employed the raisin grape cannot be perfectly at\r\nhome. Of late years spring frosts have become very rare in our principal\r\nraisin districts, and the practice of double pruning is no longer\r\nthought of.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Summer Pruning, or Pruning Green Wood._--Summer pruning is a much\r\ndisputed vineyard operation, which, however, at least in some\r\nlocalities, is of great importance. This summer, or rather spring,\r\npruning consists of cutting back the young growing shoots from one-third\r\nto one-half just after the berries have set well. The proper time of the\r\nyear is in May, but the exact time must necessarily be different in\r\ndifferent localities and seasons. In Fresno the cutting back should not\r\nbe done later than May, and never except when the vines show a vigorous\r\ngrowth. The principal object the summer pruner has in view is to force\r\nthe secondary branches of the vine as much towards the center of the\r\nvine as possible, so as to form there a perfect canopy of shade to serve\r\nas a protection to the young and tender berries. If let alone, the\r\nbranches of the vine will throw out these secondary shoots near the top\r\nof the branches, thus leaving the head of the vine unprotected from the\r\nsun. The shortening in of the branches necessarily throws the new shoots\r\nto the center of the vine. A not less important object to be sought by\r\nthe summer pruning is the strengthening of the young branch. In May,\r\nwhen the vines are covered by the young and vigorous shoots, they are\r\nyet exceedingly brittle, and only a slight pushing is required to break\r\nthe branch off just at its junction with the old wood. A heavy wind at\r\nthis time sometimes does an immense damage, and the vineyard will look\r\nas though every vine had been dragged over. Half of the branches may be\r\nbroken and hang partially attached to one side of the vine. A single\r\nwind may ruin two-thirds of the crop. This can only be prevented by the\r\nsummer pruning of the vines. By a heavy shortening in of the branches,\r\nthe latter expose so much less surface for the wind to act on, that no\r\nbranches are broken, and we have failed to see the heaviest wind cause\r\nany noticeable damage in vineyards which had their vines properly\r\nshortened in. The summer pruning in no way injures the vines. The sap is\r\nchecked in its flow only for a few days, and within a week the new side\r\nshoots make their appearance. But the vineyardist must be careful not to\r\nsummer prune after the hot summer weather has set in, as the hot weather\r\nwill burn or scald the young grapes and ruin them entirely. For the San\r\nJoaquin valley raisin districts, I cannot advise summer pruning after\r\nthe first days of June; in Southern California, somewhat later.\r\nGrapevines on sandy, dry and poor soil should not be summer pruned, or\r\nonly very lightly so. They have not strength to start a new growth and\r\nwill remain stunted all through the season.\r\n\r\nMany growers of Riverside, El Cajon and Fresno consider summer pruning\r\nbeneficial, if not necessary, and practice it every year regularly. It\r\nis necessary to summer prune heavily or not at all. Cut back one-half of\r\nthe growth, or cut back leaving one or two leaves above the bunch of\r\ngrapes on every cane. If the young canes are only topped, the secondary\r\nbranches will come out near the ends of the canes and bear them down, in\r\ntime exposing the bunches to the sun as well as causing the second crop\r\nto grow too far from the main trunk, the summer pruning thus acting the\r\nopposite of which it was intended. In Greece the wine grapevines are\r\nsummer pruned, but the currants are never so treated.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Root-pruning._--The pruning of the roots of grapevines, in order to\r\ncause them to bear, is entirely unnecessary, and is never done by\r\nexperienced growers. Some growers have practiced the cutting of the\r\nsurface roots of the vines so as to cause the tap roots or the main\r\nroots to go farther down, and they claim that by this method greater\r\ncrops are harvested. I am satisfied this is only a theory not supported\r\nby facts. Surface roots are as necessary to plants as deep-soil roots,\r\nand serve the plants in their way, bringing atmospheric air to the\r\ncirculation in the roots. If too many surface roots are formed, it is a\r\nsure indication of too much water in the top soil, as too frequent\r\nirrigation with a small stream of water will cause such roots to form.\r\nThe proper remedy is to irrigate less frequently, but more at a time.\r\nThe above does not refer to the pruning of the roots of grafted vines.\r\nIn cases where Muscats have been grafted on resistant stocks, it is of\r\nimportance that the graft should not make roots of its own, as these\r\nwould soon overpower the stock and in their turn succumb to the enemies\r\nwhich it was the intention to avoid. When rooted vines are planted in\r\nthe vineyard, their roots should be well pruned, and all dead and\r\ndecaying, as well as dried-up, parts should be removed. If they are\r\nallowed to remain on the vines, they will draw moisture from the sound\r\nparts at a time when all the moisture is needed for the formation of new\r\nroots.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Suckering._--The object of this process is to relieve the raisin-vine\r\nof superfluous wood before the latter has had time to draw on the\r\nstrength of the vine and deprive it of the elements necessary to support\r\nthe fruit-bearing branches. The proper time for suckering is early in\r\nthe spring, when the young wood is yet tender and easily broken. With a\r\nhard and flat piece of wood, the lower suckers are dug out from below\r\nthe ground, while the upper suckers may be broken by hand. A sucker must\r\nbe understood to be any branch which does not produce fruit at a time\r\nwhen the vine is old enough to bear. In strong and moist soil and on\r\nstrong vines even the lowest shoots produce grapes, and can therefore\r\nhardly be called suckers. But as a rule even they should be removed,\r\nunless we have a special object in view, such as renewing the trunk of\r\nthe vine, lowering its head, or in otherwise encouraging the lower\r\nbranches.\r\n\r\nWhile few vineyardists take sufficient care and time to sucker their\r\nvines, there can be no doubt that the operation is of the greatest\r\nimportance, in order that as large and good a crop as possible may be\r\nsecured. It is not only best to remove all the non-fruit-bearing\r\nbranches which spring out from the root and the trunk, but also a little\r\nlater on, after the shoots have reached a foot or more, to cut any\r\nbranch from the head of the vine which does not produce fruit. In many\r\ninstances, however, it is necessary to renew the head of the vine, and\r\nfor that purpose lower suckers may be allowed to grow. For a year or two\r\nthese are pruned regularly and made to bear, and the old sickly head is\r\nthen removed.\r\n\r\n\r\nVARIOUS VINEYARD TOOLS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_General Notes._--It is not my intention to here describe the various\r\ntools used in the vineyard so minutely that they can be made after the\r\ndescription, but simply to enumerate and call attention to them in order\r\nthat as little repetition as necessary may be made. Every local\r\nblacksmith or mechanic invents, improves or patents vineyard tools of\r\nevery description, and almost every year sees new tools introduced and\r\nolder ones discarded. Still a few of these tools have become standard,\r\nand modifications of them are not always improvements.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Sheep’s-foot._--This is a very useful tool in planting grape\r\ncuttings. It consists of a round rod of three-eighths-inch iron and\r\nabout three and one-half feet long, furnished with a cross handle at the\r\nupper end. The lower end is very slightly flattened out and split to a\r\ndepth of one and one-half inches, the cleft thus formed being a little\r\nwider at the point of the bar, while the interior angle of the cleft\r\nshould be rounded in order that the cutting may not be cut. The\r\nsheep’s-foot is used in very soft ground only, where it can be pushed\r\ndown readily. In planting, the lower joint of the cutting is grasped by\r\nthe cleft in the rod, and both are pushed down together to the required\r\ndepth. A twist is then given the handle, so as to get the rod loose from\r\nthe cutting. The rod is then pulled up, and a tamp with the foot sets\r\nthe ground solid round the cutting. Care should be taken that the\r\ncutting is not pulled up with the rod, as it will prove fatal to the\r\ncutting.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Planting Bar._--This bar is used also in loose ground free from\r\nrocks. It consists of a flat bar of iron two and one-half inches wide,\r\nfrom three-eighths to one-half inch thick and three and one-half feet\r\nlong, and is furnished at the upper end with a handle. In using this\r\nbar, it is first pushed in the ground, and a hole is made for the\r\ncutting. The cutting is then pushed down into the hole, the bar inserted\r\nalongside of it and pressed forward, in order to fill the hole and set\r\nthe soil solid around the cutting.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Dibble._--This tool is simply a hard piece of oakwood, with a\r\ncurved handle and pointed. It is a most useful instrument when the vines\r\nare being pruned. By means of it the soil is scraped off from around the\r\ntrunk of the vine, to enable the pruner to cut off the suckers as close\r\nto the trunk as possible. Every pruner should be furnished with a\r\ndibble.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Planting Chains._--These are best made of twisted wire, such as is used\r\nfor clothes lines. Lines made of cotton or hemp are apt to stretch when\r\ndry, and shrink when wet. Copper wires are inserted to mark the\r\ndistances at which the vines should be planted.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Spades._--Spades are often used for planting. Long-handled spades are\r\nmore useful than those with short handles.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hoes._--Besides the common, heavy hoes, very useful hoes can be made of\r\nold shovels which are too worn to be of account as such. New handles are\r\nset on the shovel blades at a right or sharp angle, thus transforming\r\nthem into veritable hoes. With these tools much more work can be\r\naccomplished than with the common, manufactured hoe, which never cuts\r\nwell. The large, flat-faced Italian hoe imported to this country from\r\nItaly is a most admirable instrument when planting cuttings in nursery\r\nrows. In fact it is then indispensable.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Plows._--Of plows, heavy double plows for two horses are used for\r\nplowing in the center between the rows, and smaller plows for plowing\r\ncloser to the vines. As these can be had everywhere, and as every grower\r\nhas his own preferences, no description of them is required.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cultivators._--These are indispensable in the vineyard, and various\r\nmodels are in use. The common, diamond-shovel cultivator for both one\r\nand two horses is indispensable in every vineyard. The larger one of\r\nthese may be greatly improved by affixing to the posterior shovels a\r\ncutter-bar, which should stand horizontal and on a level with the center\r\nof the posterior shovels.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Randel Disc Cultivators._--These are useful in ground that has baked\r\nbefore the lately planted cuttings have begun to bud. They seldom cut or\r\ninjure any of the cuttings, and the whole field may be gone over\r\nregardless of rows or cuttings.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Ash Trough._--The ash trough consists of a long trough on wheels,\r\nall made of galvanized iron, and furnished with numerous perforated\r\nholes. It is drawn by two or more horses through the vineyard, and the\r\ncuttings are burned in it as it goes along, and the ashes are scattered\r\nover the soil. As yet this trough is only used in a few of the largest\r\nvineyards, but when perfected will be useful everywhere, as by its aid\r\nthe ashes may be saved for the vines instead of being wasted as is now\r\nso often the case.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sulphuring Cans or Bellows._--These are of various shapes and patterns.\r\nThe cans have been superseded by the simple little burlap bag, which\r\ndoes the same or better work. The bellows are similar to common bellows,\r\nbut are furnished with a distributing nozzle and with an air opening\r\nthrough which the sulphur can be poured.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Cutter-sled._--This is simply a sled four feet long by two and a\r\nhalf feet wide or more, under which has been fixed a horizontal bar of\r\niron in the shape of a shallow U. It is used in the vineyard after the\r\nplowing and cultivation is finished, and when it is of importance to\r\nkill the few remaining weeds. The driver stands on the sled, which is\r\npulled by one or two horses. It cuts all the weeds below the soil, and\r\nis a most effective and useful tool.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Vineyard Trucks._--These useful trucks are California inventions, and\r\nof the greatest importance to the grower. They are now made of various\r\nsizes, but should never be over four feet wide, while three feet is even\r\nbetter, and their length should not exceed six feet. They are made to\r\nturn readily anywhere by having the front wheels or wheel movable,\r\nindependently of the balance of the truck. By the aid of these trucks\r\nthe grower can use horse labor in distributing his boxes and trays in\r\nthe vineyard, even where the vines are planted so close that ordinary\r\nwagons cannot pass. The vineyard truck is now used in all Fresno\r\nvineyards, and is considered almost indispensable. The first truck ever\r\nmade for this purpose was designed and invented by J. T. Goodman of\r\nFresno.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Shears._--These should be of the very best make of soft steel, and\r\nfurnished with double springs. So far no good pruning shears are\r\nmanufactured in this country, the best make coming from Switzerland, and\r\nretailed here at $3.00 per pair. It pays any grower to buy the best\r\nshears, as inferior ones not only last but a short time, but also do\r\npoor and slow work, and in the long run cost more than the best and most\r\nexpensive make. With a good pair a pruner can in a day cut fifty per\r\ncent more than with a poor pair, and from ten to twenty-five per cent\r\nmore than with an ordinary pair. It therefore can be readily seen how\r\nthe extra price can be saved in the first day or two. Such fine shears\r\nshould be handled and cared for very much like a razor. They should\r\nnever be ground on a revolving stone, but only honed with oil on a fine\r\nhone. When the season is over they should be oiled, looked over and laid\r\naway. Large shears with wooden handles are not needed for Muscat vines.\r\nThe best size shear is the medium size, which can be used with one\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDRYING AND CURING.\r\n\r\n\r\nCALIFORNIA SUN-DRIED RAISINS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Note._--In describing the processes of drying, curing, packing,\r\nassorting, etc., I have followed only methods which should be used by\r\nevery conscientious raisin grower and packer. These methods are now\r\nactually in use, not by every packer and grower, but by the best of\r\nthem, by those who strive to produce a very superior article, which will\r\ncompare favorably with and compete successfully with the best products\r\nof Malaga or other foreign raisin districts. Too much poor curing and\r\npacking is done in every raisin district, to the great detriment of the\r\ndistrict, its growers and its packers. The cause of so much poor work is\r\nundoubtedly due to the method of selling the raisins in bulk for a\r\npreviously fixed sum, whether the crop is good, bad or indifferent. For\r\nmany years no inducements were held out to the grower to produce a very\r\nsuperior article, and as a consequence the packer got very little\r\nfirst-class raisins to pack. When raisins are paid for according to\r\ntheir quality alone, there will be plenty of first-class raisins, and\r\nboth packers and growers will be the gainers. The former will get more\r\nfirst-class fruit to pack, the latter will find it to their advantage to\r\nproduce it. During the last season (1889 to 1890), a change was\r\ninaugurated, and a grading of prices according to the quality of the\r\nraisins has been insisted on. When this system is fully carried out, and\r\nwhen the grower knows at the beginning of the season that he can get a\r\nhigher price for his superior raisins, California will produce as many\r\nhigh-grade raisins as Malaga or any other raisin district. Already now\r\nour average raisins are better than the average Malagas, and all that\r\nour growers ask for are inducements to produce the best. With a view to\r\npromote the attainment of these expectations, the following has been\r\nwritten. Raisins may be produced by cheaper methods than those which I\r\nadvocate, but only great care, judgment and study will accomplish the\r\nbest results. In the raisin industry it pays to produce the best, and to\r\nattain this very little extra care is required.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Time of Ripening._--Varying with different localities and seasons, the\r\nMuscat grape ripens in California between the 10th of August and the\r\n30th of September. The earliest points where raisin grapes are now grown\r\nare probably Palm Valley in San Bernardino county and the plains of Kern\r\ncounty. In both these localities Muscats have been known to be ripe as\r\nearly as July, but neither locality has yet produced any great quantity\r\nof raisins, and can hardly be considered as a raisin center. The\r\nearliness of the San Joaquin valley generally is probably caused by its\r\nsmall elevation above the sea, which is about three hundred feet for\r\nFresno, and increasing as we go farther south. San Bernardino county\r\nagain, somewhat later as to ripening, is, as far as its raisin centers\r\nare concerned, more elevated, or from one thousand to two thousand feet\r\nor more. The nearness to the sea has there also some influence to retard\r\nthe maturing of the grapes, and it is certain that in Southern\r\nCalifornia the later ripening of the raisin grapes is principally due to\r\nthis cause. Thus the picking in Riverside commences between the 10th and\r\nthe 30th of September, and while the other raisin districts in the\r\nsouthern part of California may vary some, still the ripening season\r\ncoincides very nearly with that of Riverside. In Highlands the grapes\r\nare said to ripen two weeks later than at Riverside. In El Cajon the\r\ngrapes ripen between the 1st and 10th of September. In Fresno the\r\nMuscatel raisin grapes ripen in the end of August, and generally by the\r\n20th of August the picking has begun everywhere on the drier soils,\r\nwhile on the wet soils it is generally retarded from one to two weeks.\r\nAs a rule the dryness of the soil influences considerably the ripening\r\nof the grapes, and even the quality of the soil is not without some\r\ninfluence, as on sandy, warm soil grapes ripen much earlier than on\r\nheavy land. As an illustration of such early ripening, we may mention\r\nthat, on certain gravelly soils northwest or north of Santa Ana, the\r\nMuscat grapes ripen two weeks earlier than on the heavier and finer\r\nsoils in the immediate vicinity. The growers take advantage of this\r\nearly ripening to sell their Muscat grapes fresh instead of drying them.\r\n\r\nIn Salt river and Gila valleys in Arizona the grapes are said to ripen\r\nmuch earlier than in California, but so far the vineyards there are not\r\nold enough to have been greatly benefited by this early ripening. On the\r\nplains of Kern county the ripening is hastened by the nature of the\r\nsoil, and possibly also by the nearness to the desert and the desert\r\nwind, by the greater distance from the sea, and by a less amount of\r\nrainfall. In Malaga the grapes ripen several weeks earlier than in\r\nFresno; in fact, the whole Mediterranean region seems to be earlier than\r\nCalifornia. As a general rule, we may state that the Muscat grapes ripen\r\nlater in Southern California than in the central portion of the State.\r\nIn regard to Sacramento and San Joaquin valleys, the farther we go\r\ntowards the south the earlier do the grapes ripen. But in every district\r\nthere are localities which are earlier than others. The Muscat and\r\nMuscatel ripen earlier than the Sultana, which latter grape begins to\r\nripen earlier than the Muscat, but attains perfection much later than\r\nany other of our raisin grapes. Thompson Seedless ripens in Yolo about\r\nAugust 10th, and is thus our earliest raisin grape.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Signs of Maturity._--There are three different ways by which the\r\nripeness of a grape can be tested,--saccharometer, taste or color. The\r\nsaccharometer is a well-known instrument, consisting of a graded glass\r\ntube that will sink to different depths in liquors containing different\r\npercentages of sugar. There are different kinds of saccharometers, but\r\nthe most practical one for the general raisin-grower is one divided in\r\none hundred degrees, each degree showing one per cent of sugar to every\r\nhundred of water. Thus, if the saccharometer sinks down to twenty-five,\r\nwe know that the water or must contains twenty-five per cent of\r\nsaccharine water and seventy-five per cent of water. To properly test\r\nthe grapes, a few bunches should be picked from several vines, the\r\njuice should be squeezed out and passed through a towel or otherwise\r\nstrained. The must is then poured into the test tube, and the\r\nsaccharometer inserted. If it shows twenty-five degrees or more of\r\nsugar, the grapes will make good raisins, but for very superior raisins\r\nseveral degrees more of saccharine are needed. It is not unusual to find\r\nthe grapes reach thirty degrees in favored localities and in favorable\r\nseasons. Only inexperienced vineyardists will require the aid of the\r\nsaccharometer to determine the state of ripening of the grapes; the more\r\nexperienced judge by taste and color.\r\n\r\nThe taste of course is the most commonly used method for ascertaining\r\nthe ripeness of the raisin grapes. Every grower experienced or not\r\nshould examine his grapes repeatedly. To give directions for tasting the\r\nripeness of the grapes is of course impossible; it must be learned, and\r\ncan only be learned by practice. It is enough to say here that the\r\ngrapes should taste very sweet, contain no acid, and if possible be\r\nrather solid.\r\n\r\nThe color is also a valuable adjunct in determining the ripeness of the\r\nraisin grapes. Fully ripe and perfect fruit should be amber yellow,\r\nsomewhat transparent and waxy. If this color is combined with great\r\nsweetness, and in Muscatels with absence of acidity, we can be sure that\r\nthe grapes are ripe. Some grapes do, however, especially when too much\r\nexposed to the sun, acquire the yellow amber tint without being sweet,\r\nbut they are readily distinguished from the ripe grapes by their being\r\nof smaller size and harder, tasteless and acid. Such grapes never\r\ndevelop into good, mature grapes, and do not make good raisins. I may\r\nalso remark that not all ripe grapes become amber colored. Those that\r\ngrow in the shade and on very damp ground remain always green, although\r\nthey acquire a certain sweetness, and will make good raisins. The Muscat\r\ngrapes will make salable raisins even if not fully ripe, but in order to\r\nmake superior and good raisins all grapes should be “dead” ripe,\r\nespecially so if the grapes are to be dipped in lye. If unripe or\r\npartially ripe grapes of Muscats and Sultanas are dipped, they make very\r\npoor and red raisins; it would have been better-if they had never been\r\ndipped. This is especially the case with the Sultana, which begins to\r\nripen and is eatable long before the Muscat, but which only makes a good\r\ndipped raisin after the Muscat has been ripe for some time. Three or\r\nfour days make a great difference sometimes in the amount of sugar in\r\nthe grapes, and consequently in the quality of the raisins, and the\r\nexperienced grower will keep his grapes on the vines as long as possible\r\nto attain the greatest possible amount of sweetness. But on the other\r\nhand it takes judgment to foresee how sweet the grapes will be, as in\r\nunfavorable seasons they will not attain their full sweetness even if\r\nallowed to hang long on the vines. To know the time after which the\r\ngrapes do not increase in sugar requires much experience and\r\nacquaintance with the locality where they are grown. In this respect\r\ndifferent years vary very much.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Picking._--Many vineyardists pick their raisins too green or before\r\nthey are fully ripe. Not all raisins ripen at the same time, and to make\r\nthe best possible raisins out of the grapes, it is necessary to pick\r\nover the vineyard several times, each time picking only the ripest\r\ngrapes. In places where there are two crops of grapes, at least two\r\npickings are absolutely necessary, and in many places two pickings are\r\nenough. The green grapes of the first crop are then left to be picked\r\nwith the second crop, at which time they will probably be perfectly ripe\r\nand very choice. But if the vineyard is small and manageable, and the\r\nowner wishes to realize the most that he possibly can, he should make at\r\nleast three different pickings, each time taking care only to pick those\r\ngrapes which are fully ripe and which would make a first-class quality\r\nof raisins. As long as the smaller vineyardists sell their raisins in\r\nbulk at a contracted price of so much a pound for any kind or quality of\r\nraisins, we cannot expect any great improvement in the too common mode\r\nof picking, where good, bad and indifferent grapes go on the trays\r\ntogether. But I am certain that in a few years this will or must change.\r\nRaisins in sweatboxes will bring the price they are actually worth, and\r\nit will be to the interest of every grower to pick his grapes at the\r\ntime they will make the best possible raisins, even if extra labor is\r\nrequired for the work. The pickers generally use small, pointed knives\r\nfor separating the bunches, and they are preferable to small shears, as\r\nbetter enabling the picker to reach farther in between bunches and\r\nbranches, and to cut the former without injuring the branch.\r\n\r\nIn picking the bunches, great care should be taken, much more than is at\r\npresent in use. It is always best to begin picking in the poorest part\r\nof the vineyard, as it will take some time for the pickers to learn;\r\nthey are almost certain to pick in the beginning too many green grapes.\r\nThe poorest part of the vineyard is also apt to have the ripest grapes.\r\nThe large, fine bunches should be handled with the utmost care, in order\r\nthat the bloom of the grapes may not be injured. The bunches generally\r\nshould be handled by the stems only, or, if this is impracticable, by\r\nthe stem as much as possible. In separating a large bunch from the vine,\r\nthe bunch should be cut as close to the stem as possible, and at the end\r\nof the stem of the bunch there should remain a portion of that broader\r\npart by which the bunch is attached to the main branch. There is nothing\r\nprettier on a bunch of raisins than this broad end of the bunch; it\r\ngives an idea of strength and oddity to the raisin cluster, showing the\r\nbuyer at a glance that it is a cluster which was once solidly attached\r\nto the vine. Many raisin-packers place this broad end of the bunch so as\r\nto protrude above or between the berries, as if inviting the purchaser\r\nto take hold of it and thus lift the luscious bunch out of the box. With\r\nthe poorer and smaller bunches, no such care in cutting need be\r\nexercised, and it would be to no benefit to so cut a small, poor bunch\r\nthat it would cause the purchaser to believe it was a large bunch.\r\nPoorer bunches might therefore be cut with short stems. As to the\r\nhandling of the bunches, the intelligent grower will soon learn how to\r\ninstruct his men. If vine branches interfere with the lifting of the\r\nbunch from the vine, some of them may be cut without any injury to the\r\nvine, but too many branches cut this way will cause a new growth to\r\nstart, which often is derived from the best fruit buds for the ensuing\r\nseason, and which always is apt to be injured from frost.\r\n\r\nA picker should average not less than fifty trays a day of cleaned and\r\nassorted grapes. At this rate the picking of twenty pounds of grapes\r\ncosts about two and a half cents. Some persons employing white labor\r\nclaimed to have lowered the cost of picking to one and three-quarter\r\ncents per tray of twenty pounds, but I failed to learn how these grapes\r\nhad been handled, cleaned and assorted. The picking of the grapes is\r\nfacilitated by previous care given the vines. Neglected and entangled\r\nvines are much more difficult and expensive to pick than those which\r\nhave been properly cared for and correctly pruned the season before. The\r\nsame may be said as regards vines between the branches of which weeds\r\nhave been allowed to grow. In picking from such vines, the grapes are\r\nalways torn, the best bunches destroyed and many grapes wasted on the\r\nground.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Raisin Vineyard Truck.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cleaning._--When the bunch is picked or cut from the stem, it should be\r\ncleaned. If it is a first-class or even an ordinary layer bunch, every\r\nsunburnt berry, every leaf, twig or other conspicuous foreign substance,\r\nmust be carefully removed with the picker’s right hand, while the left\r\nhand holds the bunch by the stem. This cleaning must some time be done,\r\nand at no time can it be performed with better results than when the\r\ngrapes are green. The stems are then soft and flexible, while later on\r\nthey are brittle, and in endeavoring to remove foreign substances many\r\nberries will be detached, or sometimes even the whole bunch broken. This\r\ncleaning of the bunch does not need to extend to third-rate or small\r\nbunches, which are to be used for loose raisins. The latter can be\r\ncleaned very rapidly with machinery, and it would only be a waste of\r\ntime to clean them by hand-picking. The use of a pair of bellows is also\r\nvery practical. With them much of the spider webs and smaller refuse can\r\nbe removed, which could not be gotten rid of in any other way. A few\r\nhands should therefore go over all finer bunches and blow them clean,\r\nespecially if sand or dust have accumulated on the trays or bunches. If\r\nthe grapes are carefully assorted when picked, and the different grades\r\nplaced on separate trays as they should be, this cleaning is done\r\nrapidly, as the largest part of the crop, which only will make loose\r\nraisins, need not be cleaned.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Drying on Trays._--As soon as the grapes begin to ripen, the trays\r\nshould be distributed along the rows in the vineyard. They may either\r\nfirst be placed in piles at every row where the roads cross the\r\nvineyard, or at once distributed along the vines. The former method is\r\nto be preferred, as it protects the trays from dirt and dust, and in\r\ndistributing afterwards it gives the pickers a more varied labor, often\r\nwelcome as a change from the cramped position necessary in picking.\r\nMuscat vines in proper bearing require one or two trays to the vine,\r\nwhile for young vines one tray will suffice. The probable quantity\r\nneeded should be ascertained beforehand in order that the trays may be\r\nproperly distributed. The ripe grapes are always placed directly on the\r\ntrays, and not previously picked in boxes. In placing the bunches on the\r\ntrays, the proper way for each picker should be to have two trays, one\r\nfor each grade. On one tray he places all the large bunches that promise\r\nto make first-class bunch raisins; on the other tray he places again all\r\ninferior bunches and loose berries. The smaller bunches and loose\r\nberries may be placed any way almost, as long as they are not heaped on\r\ntop of each other. The largest bunches should be placed with the stem\r\nside down, as this side will, when cured, become the finest and will\r\neventually by the careful packer be placed upwards in the box. That part\r\nof the raisin which in drying touches the tray will also present, when\r\ncured, a flat surface with several concentric layers, which are\r\nconsidered a prominent feature in the perfect raisin.\r\n\r\nThe general method of drying is, however, to place good, bad and\r\nindifferent bunches together on the same tray, with no attempt at\r\nassorting. While this method may do when superior raisins are not\r\nrequired, and when no higher price is paid for better grades, it will be\r\nfound a very inferior practice when the grower desires to pack himself,\r\nin order to reap all the benefit he can out of his crop. For all\r\nsuperior raisins, I therefore strongly recommend the assorting of the\r\nraisins on the trays as having the following advantages. It requires\r\nless handling of the large bunches. The large bunches dry the slowest,\r\nand by having them from the beginning separated from the small and the\r\nloose the latter can be brought away to the sweatboxes, when ready,\r\nwithout necessitating the reassorting and handling from the trays, which\r\nat this time, when the stems are very brittle, is always expensive as\r\nwell as injurious to the fine bunches. The larger bunches, which are to\r\nproduce layer raisins, require less drying, as they are to be sweated or\r\nequalized before being packed. The smaller and inferior bunches, on the\r\ncontrary, must be stemmed and assorted by machinery before they are\r\nequalized, and immediately after they are taken from the trays. In order\r\nto “stem” readily these raisins must be rather overdried, as if soft\r\nthey would tear from the stems instead of having the latter broken. We\r\ncan therefore perceive the advantage of having the two grades on\r\ndifferent trays. Without the necessity of assorting we can simply take\r\nup our “layer” trays when they are ready and allow our “loose” to remain\r\nas long out as necessary, without fear of having the layers overdried.\r\nBy this assorting when green, each grade can be treated separately in a\r\nquick and effective way.\r\n\r\nA tray two by three feet may be made to comfortably hold from eighteen\r\nto twenty pounds of grapes. The first crop should be placed pretty close\r\non the trays, not allowing any part of the tray to be visible, as the\r\nreflected heat will be too great and may injure the raisins. The second\r\ncrop should be packed less close, as the reflected heat from the\r\nsurface of the tray will help to dry the grapes. This of course only\r\nrefers to localities where the temperature during the first drying is\r\nvery high. The warmer it is the closer should the bunches be packed on\r\nthe trays, and on the contrary when later on in the season, or when the\r\ndrying weather is unfavorable, plenty of space should be given the\r\ngrapes. It is often said that grapes, to make good raisins, should not\r\nonly dry, but cure. There is much truth in this. Good raisins should dry\r\nand cure at the same time, by which is meant that a chemical process is\r\ntaking place, which is something else than the mere evaporation of the\r\nwater in the grape. The heat necessary and favorable for drying the\r\ngrapes is different in different localities. At certain temperatures the\r\nraisins will get cooked and spoil, assume a red color, lose their\r\nsweetness, become sour and hard, and covered with large, sharply defined\r\ncorrugations,--signs of a very inferior or even entirely worthless\r\nraisin. In Riverside the grapes are said to cook at from 98 to 100\r\ndegrees Fahrenheit in the shade. In Fresno the grapes dry and cure well\r\nup to a temperature of 105 degrees, and in El Cajon they do not spoil\r\nuntil 103 degrees are reached. I would think that from 90 to 103 degrees\r\nin the shade would be the best temperature for drying perfectly ripe and\r\nsweet Muscat grapes. When the grapes are very ripe, a much higher\r\ntemperature will not injure them, while unripe and sour grapes,\r\nespecially of the second crop, will burn or cook at a lower temperature\r\nthan would be the proper one for ripe grapes.\r\n\r\nIt is not always advisable to stop picking when the heat becomes too\r\ngreat. A better method is to stack the trays in the field, so as to\r\nprotect the raisins from the sun. When the heat subsides, the trays are\r\nagain spread. The expense and trouble of stacking the trays is not as\r\ngreat as may be supposed, and a few hours will generally suffice to\r\nstack a large vineyard with the regular picking gang. Some packers have\r\nsuggested that to secure good raisins the trays should be stacked for\r\nseveral weeks in the beginning of the period of drying. For the\r\nproduction of our usual dark-colored raisins this is not necessary nor\r\neven advisable, except when the heat is such that the raisins would cook\r\nand spoil. With a little experience this cooking of the grapes can be\r\nreadily detected by the smell emitted by the grapes. As soon as they are\r\nin the least injured by the heat, a cooked flavor begins to pervade the\r\nwhole vineyard. When this peculiar flavor is noticed, and when the\r\nberries begin to show small red and soft blotches on the side facing the\r\nafternoon sun, the stacking should be commenced as quickly as possible.\r\nIf the trays are kept in piles for several days, the injured grapes will\r\npartially recover and at least to some extent regain their color.\r\nGreatly injured grapes will dry much slower, sometimes remaining several\r\nweeks behind those which were not injured by the sun. Slightly\r\ndiscolored raisins may partially regain their color by sweating, but\r\nthey will not improve otherwise.\r\n\r\nAfter the trays are filled with grapes, the best way is to put several\r\nrows of trays together, or rather to place the trays from three rows of\r\nvines along one of the spaces between the rows. This gives more\r\ncompactness to the crop, makes it easier to handle the trays, and\r\nfacilitates the stacking of the trays, their turning and reversing, or\r\nany labor with the trays that may be required. By thus clearing some of\r\nthe spaces between the rows, admission for trucks and wagons is had\r\nclose to the trays.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Turning._--After the grapes have been exposed to the sun for some days,\r\nthey must be turned. By this time it will be found that the grapes have\r\ndried principally on the upper side, while the lower side is yet\r\ncomparatively green. The time when the turning of the grapes should be\r\ndone depends entirely on the weather. One-half of the drying process\r\nshould be over, and this requires a longer or shorter time. When the\r\ntime for turning is at hand, it will be found that the under side of the\r\ngrapes, or rather the side of each berry that was placed against the\r\ntrays, has flattened out and shows concentric circles, which are\r\nconsidered of much beauty, and greatly valued in all good raisins. When\r\nthey are well formed and established, it is generally time to turn. If\r\nthe grapes are turned before these concentric circles are hardened, the\r\nlatter will open and become less distinct. Another objection to turning\r\ntoo early is that the upper side of the grapes, if not properly dried\r\nbefore turning, will dry but very slowly afterwards, and often so slowly\r\nthat the raisins may have to be turned a second time, which will prove\r\nboth expensive and to the disadvantage of the raisins. One turning is\r\nalways enough, and the only one proper. There are several ways to turn.\r\nThe Malaga grower, with his raisin floors, must turn his raisins by\r\nhand. The great advantage of our trays is that we can turn much quicker.\r\nThe turning is done in our vineyards by placing one tray on the top of\r\nanother and then turning them quickly over, when in changing the tray\r\nthe bottom side of the bunches will be found to be up.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Raisin Tray Catcher.]\r\n\r\nThis turning, however, requires some little knack, so as not to drop any\r\nraisins on the ground. The trays may be turned either the short or the\r\nlong way. If the long way, one tray is first placed on the top of the\r\nother, and two men catch hold of the long opposite sides of the trays by\r\nplacing their hands on the outside quarters of the edge and then\r\npressing firmly. This keeps the raisins steady between the trays, and in\r\nturning rapidly, if the bunches are at all entire, few or no raisins\r\nwill be dropped. In turning the short way, the men grasp with their\r\nopposite hands at the middle of the short sides, while with their other\r\nhands they catch the outside quarters of one of the long sides. By\r\nturning quickly over the long side that is held by the hands of the\r\nturners, the operation may be performed without dropping any berries. In\r\nsmall vineyards, where the owner must perform the work alone, he may\r\nturn the trays without any help whatever, though, naturally, his work\r\nwill be somewhat slower. He can operate by the aid of a small\r\ncontrivance called the catcher, a most simple but very effective little\r\ntool. It resembles a miniature stool like those used by the milkers of\r\ncows. The seat or top may be twelve inches long by six wide, made from\r\none-inch lumber. On one side are inserted four pegs, each about six\r\ninches long. The two opposite ones are inserted very close together, but\r\nspread strongly outward. After one tray has been placed on the top of\r\nthe other, the catcher is pushed over the long edge of the trays, which\r\nof course will cause them to jam tightly together on that side. By now\r\ngrasping the trays on the opposite edge, they may be turned without the\r\naid of any one else, and without any loss of raisins. Some use steel\r\nclips for the same purpose, but the common home-made wooden catch is\r\nundoubtedly the most practical method, as it is the cheapest.\r\n\r\nTurning should, as much as possible, be done in the morning or at least\r\nin the forenoon while the air is yet cool and the stems of the raisins\r\ndamp. The pressure of the tray will not then cause the stems to break\r\noff and the quality of the raisins to be lowered. If the bunch raisins\r\nare on separate trays, which is best, they may be turned earlier in the\r\nday than the second grade, which is not apt to be greatly damaged by the\r\nbreaking of the stems, as they are to be stemmed anyhow.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Reversing._--This is an operation not properly understood by every\r\nraisin-grower, but is still of the utmost importance, especially for the\r\nfirst-class bunches of the first crop, which naturally dry more slowly\r\nthan the smaller bunches. But the method is also very useful for the\r\nsecond crop, when late in the season the drying is slow and uncertain.\r\nThe reversing consists simply in reversing the trays on the ground in\r\nsuch a way that the edges which first faced the north afterwards face\r\nthe south, or _vice versa_. The object of reversing is plain. It will\r\nnearly always be found that the raisins at the top or on the side of the\r\ntray nearest the north will dry much more slowly than those on the side\r\nfacing the south, especially so as soon as the weather begins to turn\r\ncolder. To prevent this and insure equal drying at the top and bottom,\r\nthe reversing is performed after the trays have first been turned. This\r\nwill enable the grower to get his raisins in several days sooner than he\r\notherwise would. Indeed, at the critical period of drying, when fall\r\nrains may set in and injure the raisins, it is of the utmost importance\r\nto hurry the crop as much as possible; the reversing is at this time\r\nalmost as important as turning. I have seen the second crop of many a\r\nvineyard seriously injured by rain, and its drying delayed only through\r\nneglect to reverse the trays. The effect of reversing is oftentimes very\r\nstriking, and one grower who reverses his trays in time may get his crop\r\nin safely, while his neighbor who neglects reversing may lose a great\r\npart of his. A few days’ delay at this time of the year is often fatal\r\nto the whole second crop, and no pains should be spared in order to\r\nhasten the drying by every possible means available.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Slanting the Trays._--The practice of raising one end of the tray\r\nhigher than the other is of very questionable value. In the fore part of\r\nthe drying season, the heat from the sun is such that the raisins\r\nreceive all the heat they require without being raised at an angle\r\nagainst the sun. Towards the end of the season, I have found that, when\r\nthe trays have been raised, those grapes which lie on the lower edge of\r\nthe tray, and accordingly nearest to the ground, dry the quickest, while\r\nthose at the upper edge dry considerably slower. The cause is that the\r\nair a foot above the ground is much cooler than close to the ground; the\r\nlarge space under the raised tray also serves as a cooling room to cool\r\nthe tray. In some direct experiments made, it was found that, as regards\r\nthe tail end of the first crop, the raised trays came in several days\r\nlater than the trays which had remained flat on the ground. In\r\nadvocating that the trays should not be tilted, I must not be understood\r\nto mean that it is not beneficial to keep the tray in a tilted position\r\nwhen there is a close background to sufficiently heat the air equally at\r\nthe upper and lower end of the trays. This can only be secured by either\r\nplacing the trays against the side of a hill or on specially prepared\r\ndrying floors, which are described further on. In this connection I may\r\nsuggest that when the heat of the sun is not great, and when the raisins\r\ndry slowly, the placing of an empty tray behind the drying tray, in\r\norder to reflect the sun on the raisins, will considerably hasten their\r\ndrying. This is a valuable aid in drying, especially when the second\r\ncrop is late.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Elevating the Trays._--The practice of elevating the trays containing\r\nthe tail end of the second crop is a good one. The best way is to place\r\nthe trays on the top of the vines, when it will be found that the free\r\ncirculation of air underneath will help to dry the raisins and prevent\r\nrot and mold. This method is only adopted after fall rains, but is then\r\nof great help in drying the crop.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Stacking Against Rain and Dew._--The stacking of the trays is also a\r\nvaluable help in keeping out dew and cold. Late in the season, when it\r\ntakes several hours of sunlight to dry the night dews, the stacked trays\r\nwill be dry when the first rays of the sun are out. When heavy rains are\r\nexpected, the grapes, whether partially dried or not, should always be\r\nstacked. It will keep the stems from rotting off from the berries, and\r\nwill generally save the crop from being seriously injured. Some growers\r\nhave an idea that only the partially dried grapes should be stacked, but\r\nthe green ones are equally benefited.\r\n\r\nThere are several ways of stacking. The flat-stacking is used\r\nprincipally when the raisins are very dry, and when it is of importance\r\nthat no air should enter the trays. In flat-stacking, one tray is simply\r\nplaced on the top of the other, and the circulation of air thus brought\r\nto a minimum. In rainy weather, however, the roof-stacking is to be\r\npreferred. Instead of placing one tray on the top of another, the trays\r\nare placed in two piles joining each other in such a way that the inner\r\nend of every tray overlaps the edge of the tray in the adjoining pile.\r\nThis lifting up of one edge of the tray gives to the whole pile a\r\nroof-like appearance, and the angle in which the trays join together\r\nbecomes steeper the higher the pile grows, until, at the height of\r\nthree or four feet, the trays slant so much that the raisins cannot rest\r\non them, but are in danger of sliding off, when, of course, the pile\r\nshould not be made any higher. It takes several times longer to stack\r\nthe trays in roof fashion than to simply pile them up flat. The\r\nadvantage of roof-stacking is that it admits more air, and sheds the\r\nrain better. In damp weather the piles should not be covered on the\r\nsides for any length of time, as the raisins will then mold more\r\nrapidly. If, instead of joining two piles of trays, three piles are made\r\nto join, the center stack will be flat, while much air is admitted to\r\nthe raisins. In this stacking the first two trays are placed flat on the\r\nground at almost the distance of one tray. Another tray is made to rest\r\non the inner edge of the lower trays and cover the intermediate space,\r\nand so on. This method gives twice as much air space between the trays\r\nas regular flat-stacking, and is to be recommended when the weather is\r\ndamp. A combination of this last method and roof-stacking is used by\r\nsome, every grower almost having his favorite way to stack. It must be\r\nremembered that in very rainy weather no kind of stacking will be of any\r\nvalue, while, when the showers are few and far between, stacking may\r\nsave the crop.\r\n\r\nStacking is especially valuable in conjunction with dryers, when\r\nprotection during a few days only is all that is needed. One man can\r\nstack about five hundred trays an hour, and the regular picking gang can\r\nstack a whole vineyard in a few hours. Should the rain be very heavy and\r\nno dryer handy, it is of no use to try to save the crop after the mold\r\nhas begun to make its appearance, and when the berries have begun to\r\nrot. It is then far better to dump the whole crop in the field rather\r\nthan to spend time, money and anxiety on raisins which must in any case\r\nbecome a total loss.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Taking Up._--When, at last, the raisins are sufficiently dried, they\r\nmust be taken up as quickly as possible. This process again consists of\r\nthree different labors,--the stacking, assorting and boxing. It is of\r\ngreat importance to know exactly when the raisins have sufficiently\r\ndried to be ready for the sweatboxes. This can properly only be\r\nascertained by experience, still a few directions will materially help\r\nthe inexperienced grower in his judgment. A perfect raisin should be\r\nneither too hard nor too soft. A raisin is too soft when, after rolling\r\nit between the fingers, the least particle of juice exudes through the\r\ncracked skin or meat. Such raisins will “sugar” in course of time, and\r\nnot keep a year. If the raisins, or a majority of them, on a bunch are\r\ntoo wet, they should be spread to the sun for some time longer. If,\r\nhowever, there are only a few underdried raisins in a bunch, the bunch\r\nmay be taken in, and the soft raisins clipped off afterwards. A raisin\r\nis too dry when, in pressing and rolling it between two fingers, the\r\npulp does not move readily inside the skin. Such overdried raisins will\r\nnot again become first-class raisins; their skin will always be tough,\r\nand their color will be somewhat inferior. If but slightly overdried,\r\nthey may be brought out by equalizing. To know when the raisins are in a\r\nproper condition to take up is most important to every raisin-man, and\r\nhe should never neglect to watch his trays early and late. Upon his good\r\njudgment and watchfulness depend the quality of his crop. To prevent\r\ntoo rapid drying out after the raisins are nearly ready, the practice\r\nnow is to stack the trays in the field.\r\n\r\nThis stacking simply consists in placing the trays which contain the\r\nready raisins on top of each other, in piles five feet high. On the top\r\nof every such pile are placed several loose trays crosswise, so as to\r\nshelter the pile from the sun, and possibly even from rain, and other\r\ntrays are raised up against the sides of the pile in order to exclude as\r\nmuch air as possible. If, however, the raisins are rather underdried,\r\nthe side trays may be left out so as to allow the raisins to dry more.\r\nIt is always best to stack the trays before the raisins are fully dried,\r\nas they will finish drying and curing in the stack much better than in\r\nthe sun. The underdried raisins will thus dry just enough, while the\r\noverdried ones, or those just right, will not dry much more.\r\n\r\nAfter the stacking is done, the assorting is in order. This consists in\r\ntaking out every bunch that is not sufficiently dried to go into the\r\nsweatbox, and placing them on new trays to dry more. At this time, also,\r\nthe bad or inferior and red berries may be taken out, if present in a\r\nvery large quantity on good bunches; but when there are only a few on,\r\nit is better not to touch the bunch, as, in handling it, it is only too\r\napt to break. Any further picking out of bad berries had better be\r\ndeferred to the packing-house. The boxing and assorting, which may be\r\nconsidered together, consist in transferring the different grades of the\r\nnow dried raisins to separate sweatboxes. This is done in two ways. The\r\nnumber one bunches, which have been placed on separate trays, may now\r\nsimply be slid into the sweatbox, by a dexterous movement of the tray.\r\nBetween every two layers of these first-class bunches should be placed a\r\nstout manilla paper cut so as to exactly fit the box. It is of\r\nimportance to have the paper just fit the box, and not be too large nor\r\ntoo small, as in either case the raisins are apt to become mixed and the\r\nbunches broken. But, if the grapes have not been assorted from the\r\nbeginning on separate trays, more work will be required to get them into\r\nthe sweatboxes. Every bunch must be carefully taken up by hand from the\r\ntray, and then placed on the paper in the box. But in doing so many\r\nbunches are necessarily broken, as even careful hands cannot help\r\nfrequent mishaps, while ignorant and careless workmen may do an immense\r\ninjury to the crop. Too few manilla papers are generally used. Some\r\npackers require only two papers in every box, while six or eight, or at\r\nleast five, papers should be the proper number for every box of very\r\nchoice or even ordinary layers. We must remember that, the more papers\r\nwe use, the less apt are the bunches to be injured, but even the best\r\nlayer bunches will not suffer if placed two layers high between every\r\npaper. On top and in the bottom of every box must be one paper, so as to\r\nkeep out dust. The loose and inferior raisins, which either have been\r\nleft on the tray after the layers are picked out, or which from the\r\nbeginning have been placed on separate trays, may now, when perfectly\r\ndry, be simply dumped in sweatboxes without any paper.\r\n\r\nWe have thus at least two kinds of sweatboxes. One kind contains those\r\nraisins which are destined to make layers, and which require sweating\r\nand equalizing before they can be packed. The other kind contains the\r\nloose and drier berries, which are to go immediately to the stemmer and\r\ngrader, and which would not separate from the stems if they were made to\r\nequalize.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Covering._--If the weather has been favorable, the raisins may have\r\nbeen dried and cured in twelve days. Of these twelve days, the first\r\nseven or eight were used for drying the upper side of the raisins. On\r\nthe seventh or eighth day they were turned, and on the twelfth day they\r\nwere ready to put in the sweatboxes. But this is fast drying, and drying\r\nunder favorable circumstances, with a dry wind blowing gently all the\r\ntime. But sometimes it takes a much longer time to dry, say from\r\nfourteen to twenty-one days. In Fresno, where the weather is less\r\nfavorable, the drying of the first crop may require from two to three\r\nweeks. In El Cajon it always takes two or three weeks for the raisins to\r\ndry, and in Orange county the drying sometimes requires from thirty days\r\nto five weeks. In Malaga the drying is accomplished quicker than in\r\nCalifornia, because there they cover the raisin floors every night with\r\ncanvas, and in the morning, when the canvas is unrolled, the raisins are\r\nyet warm. The drying, then, has been continued all night, and the\r\nraisins have not had time to cool when they meet the first rays of the\r\nsun. In California, again, our raisins are cold, possibly even wet with\r\ndew or rain, and it sometimes takes the sun until noon to dry up the\r\nmoisture accumulated through the night.\r\n\r\nTo counteract this absorption of moisture, many of the raisin-growers in\r\nOrange county, California, especially around Santa Ana and McPherson,\r\ncover the trays with canvas every night. This method is to be\r\nrecommended wherever there is any difficulty in curing either the first\r\nor the second crop. If this method is employed, I am satisfied that\r\nraisins could be grown and properly cured in localities where otherwise\r\nno raisin cult is possible. The method of covering the raisin trays at\r\nSanta Ana is as follows, varied by different growers, but in the main\r\nthe same everywhere. The trays are placed together in long rows; about\r\ntwenty yards long is found to be most convenient. The width of the row\r\nis just the width of two trays, or five feet. Thus the row of trays\r\nladen with raisin grapes is about sixty feet long by five feet wide.\r\nAlong the north end of this long row of trays are driven down small\r\nposts every six or ten feet, and left extending about two feet above the\r\nground. Along the south side of the row of trays smaller posts are\r\ndriven down at the same distances, but not allowed to extend so high\r\nabove the surface of the soil. These pegs or small posts may best be\r\nslanting outward, or from the trays. Along the high posts is strung a\r\nwire in such a way that it cannot easily get loose. To a long canvas\r\ncover are now secured small rings for running on the wire, and on the\r\nother side larger rings to hook over the smaller posts in front. If the\r\ncanvas is only one yard wide, two widths must be sewed together so as to\r\nmake the canvas six feet wide. The trays, which are two and one-half\r\nfeet by three feet, when placed side by side will just form a drying\r\nfloor of five feet, large enough to be covered by the canvas six feet\r\nwide. The cost of canvas is six and one-half cents a yard by the bale.\r\n\r\nThe manner of using the canvas is very simple. The canvas cover, which\r\nis stationary, is attached to the wire and the higher posts. Every\r\nevening the cover is thrown over the trays, the front or lower edge is\r\nhooked by the aid of the rings over the pegs in the ground, and the\r\ntrays thus securely sheltered. In the morning, when the sun is up, the\r\ncover is thrown back over the higher posts, and the trays fully exposed.\r\nThe trouble to cover is not very great; two men can cover forty tons of\r\ngrapes in half an hour, and generally it is considered that the\r\npicking-gang can cover the whole crop in half an hour’s time every\r\nevening, and it takes them as long to uncover in the morning. If well\r\ncared for and properly dried, and stored away in the autumn after the\r\ncrop is all in, this canvas cover, with its posts, will last six or\r\nseven years, and if painted or oiled would probably last still longer.\r\nOne yard of canvas can cover thirty pounds of grapes, and for the\r\npurpose of utilizing the full space, the trays are made two and one-half\r\nby three feet.\r\n\r\nSuch is the process practiced in Orange county. If adopted elsewhere, it\r\nwould enable many localities to produce good raisins, where the climatic\r\nconditions are such that no drying is now practicable. The process is\r\nnot as good as the one employed in Malaga, but it has some advantages\r\nwhich make it very acceptable. It enables the grower to use trays, and\r\nit makes drying-floors unnecessary, and the spaces in the vineyard can\r\nbe used without taking away room from the vines. On the other hand, the\r\ndrying-floors of Malaga are warmer and more secure, and almost\r\nabsolutely safe in case of rain.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Drying-floors._--While, in some parts of California, the first crop\r\ndries generally without any difficulty, in other parts rain and dew very\r\nfrequently interfere with the drying of even the first crop. In many\r\nplaces where raisin-curing is not successful, the same could be\r\npracticed profitably if we would adopt the system of drying-floors used\r\nin Spain. Even in localities where the first-crop raisins dry well, the\r\nsecond crop is always exposed to more or less rain, and the\r\nraisin-grower annually loses large sums of money on account of not being\r\nable to hasten the drying of the second crop. But it is doubtful if the\r\nMalaga drying-floors will ever be found practical and come into general\r\nuse with us. They take considerable space from the vineyard, and are\r\nvery expensive, but they are very secure, and when once built are very\r\nprofitable. A limited number of such floors would be very useful in\r\nevery vineyard, especially for drying the second crop. At present no\r\nsuch floors exist in this State. The following description gives an idea\r\nof how they may be constructed:\r\n\r\nThese drying-floors may be built of brick with the long sides as long as\r\nrequired, while the short sides should be about twelve feet long. The\r\nback wall is six feet high, while the front wall is only six inches\r\nhigh, which, with the above length of side wall, would give enough\r\nslope. In Malaga the interior is filled with black gravel and tamped\r\nhard, but for our purpose probably nothing would be superior to\r\nasphaltum, bituminous rock or cement. It must first be ascertained if\r\nbituminous rock would not impart a flavor to the grapes, in which case\r\ncement would be the most useful flooring. In order to allow the rain to\r\nrun off, the front wall should be pierced with small holes close to the\r\nground, but this would only be necessary in case the bed is filled with\r\ngravel, or no cement floor exists on top of it. Along the back part of\r\nthe floor should be set a row of uprights of two by four lumber, driven\r\nsecurely in the ground. On the top of each post is set an eyelet,\r\nthrough which runs a stout wire along the whole back of the frame. A\r\ncanvas cover long enough to reach the whole length of the floor should\r\nbe used for covering, and, in order to secure it to the wire and the\r\nposts, it should be hemmed and furnished with small rings to run on the\r\nwire. In front similar rings are set in order that the canvas may be\r\nsecured to the smaller posts and kept down in case of wind. On such\r\nfloors common trays may be used. To make the canvas impervious to rain,\r\nit may be painted with boiled linseed oil. The above are only\r\nsuggestions based on the Spanish drying-floors. For a full description\r\nof them, I beg to refer to the article on Malaga. In using linseed oil,\r\ncare should be taken that only pure oil is used. There is linseed oil\r\nwhich contains chemicals which rapidly rot the canvas.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dryers._--The subject of dryers is of great importance to the\r\nCalifornia grower. The last few years have fully demonstrated that every\r\nraisin vineyard, no matter where it is situated, should have one or more\r\ndryers, in order that the last of the crop may be dried properly when\r\nthe rain sets in. Many years these dryers are not required, but from\r\ntime to time they prove of vast value, and if properly constructed are\r\nmuch superior to any drying-floor. But so far no perfect dryer has ever\r\nbeen constructed. Most dryers are too expensive, costing from three\r\nthousand to seven thousand dollars, when of a capacity to dry from\r\ntwenty-five to fifty tons of green grapes at one charge. Nearly all late\r\ndryers are constructed with a fan, which sucks the air out through one\r\nend of the building. The large complicated dryers are all patented, but\r\nthere can be no doubt that good small dryers might be constructed by\r\nevery grower, which will do good service. As, however, so far no very\r\nperfect dryers have ever been constructed, and as every owner of one\r\nchanges and rebuilds every year, we must leave the consideration of the\r\nconstruction of these dryers to some future time when more knowledge or\r\nexperience will have been gained. Dryers large enough to hold a charge\r\nof one ton of green fruit have been constructed at the price of two\r\nhundred dollars by Ellwood Cooper of Santa Barbara. They dried their\r\nfruit in twenty-four hours, but they were never used for raisins.\r\n\r\nBut as this style of dryer may be adapted to raisins, I will give a few\r\nhints at its construction. The heating apparatus consists of a large\r\niron drum, or radiator, seventeen and one-half feet long by two and\r\none-half feet wide, set on a furnace in which is burned wood. The\r\nfurnace and radiator are built into a bank, on top of which the dryer is\r\nbuilt. This dryer is simply a large wooden box about seventeen feet\r\nsquare and six feet high, and looks, as seen from the outside, like a\r\nchest full of drawers. These slide on frames, are deeper than they are\r\nbroad, and contain movable bottoms or trays made of small redwood ribs.\r\nThey begin about two feet from the top of the radiator; if closer, the\r\nheat would be too strong for the fruit. The ventilation is had by small\r\nsliding doors at the bottom of the chest, through which the air rushes\r\nin, while it goes out through the drawers, which for this purpose are\r\nleft open an inch or two. The chest is covered over with an open shed,\r\nwhich makes the labor pleasant, and enables the attendant to inspect any\r\ndrawer at any time without seriously disturbing the heat of the dryer.\r\nThe cheapness and effectiveness of such small dryers are such that every\r\none can afford them. A dozen such small dryers all set in a row in a\r\nbank could be attended to by very few hands. They would also be\r\npreferable to very large dryers on account of the short time required to\r\nfill them, and their raisins can be dried long before a larger dryer has\r\nbeen filled.\r\n\r\nAs to the usefulness of steam or fire dryers there can be no doubt. The\r\nidea is not to entirely dry the raisins in them, but only to finish up\r\nthe raisins when, on account of unfavorable climatic conditions, they do\r\nnot dry any more out-of-doors. The question as to which are best,\r\n“machine-dried” raisins or those dried in the sun, is entirely\r\nunimportant. No one would think of drying raisins entirely in the dryer,\r\nas it would not pay. Raisins properly finished in the dryer are not\r\ninferior to those entirely sun-dried.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sweatboxes._--The sweatboxes should be made of strong lumber one inch\r\nthick. The length and width should be according to the size of the tray,\r\nand always one inch larger every way than the tray, in order that the\r\nraisins may be let down readily, or that they may receive a tray. The\r\nheight of a sweatbox should be from six to eight inches, no more, as a\r\ngreater depth will make them too heavy to be handled with ease by two\r\nmen. Six inches in depth is better than eight. In order to secure the\r\nbox and prevent it from splitting, the sides should be bound with hide,\r\niron bands or with twisted galvanized wire. The latter is the strongest\r\nand best, costs the least, and is the easiest to put on.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Trays for Drying._--The tray consists of a wooden frame made of\r\nwell-dried half-inch lumber, nailed to cleats of one inch by one and\r\none-half inch and of desired length. The lumber most commonly used is\r\nwell-seasoned spruce. Pine, if not well seasoned, is apt to give the\r\nraisins a taste of the wood or of rosin, while redwood may discolor the\r\nraisins if exposed to rain or very heavy dew. But as the lumber attains\r\nage, it also becomes less injurious to the grapes. Cottonwood or\r\npoplar-wood, which can be obtained in some places, make most useful\r\nlumber for trays, as they do not contain any taste or other substance\r\napt to injure the raisins. The size of the tray varies according to the\r\nidea of the raisin-grower, but the size generally adopted is two by\r\nthree feet. Formerly a smaller tray was used, but no smaller ones are\r\nnow made. A larger size, three by three feet, is used by several\r\ngrowers, but, while it has the advantage of holding more grapes, it is\r\nalso less readily handled than the smaller tray. In the southern part of\r\nCalifornia, a tray two and one-half by three feet is very popular. The\r\ntops of the trays are bought in the shape of shingles, which should be\r\nwell dried before being nailed, as they will otherwise shrink up and\r\ncause cracks to form in the tray, greatly to the detriment of the drying\r\nof the raisins. Loss is also caused by loose raisins dropping through\r\nsuch cracks. The cleats should be wet or green, or they will split in\r\nnailing. If too dry, they should be soaked in water over night or for a\r\nfew hours. The shingles should be planed on the side which is to be\r\nplaced upwards. The cost of the lumber for the trays varies from nine to\r\ntwelve and one-half cents in the shooks. For nailing the trays together,\r\na frame is made of wood and iron. The cleats are placed on the two\r\nshort, opposite sides, with a heavy bar of iron immediately underneath\r\nso as to clinch the nails. The planed shingles are then placed on top\r\nand nailed to the cleats with round-wire nails, which clinch\r\nautomatically on the lower side as soon as they strike the iron bar. No\r\ncleats are required on the long side of small size trays, but if a\r\nlarger tray is used a bar on each side may be required to give the tray\r\nsufficient strength. A good workman, after a few days of practice, can\r\ncomfortably nail up four hundred trays a day. When the season is over,\r\nevery tray should be nailed up and washed, or at least swept clean and\r\nstored dry. The age of a tray, if cared for, is about ten years.\r\n\r\n\r\nCALIFORNIA LYE-DIPPED RAISINS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_General Notes._--In California the dipping of raisins in solutions of\r\nlye is yet in its very infancy, and I do not think that in the whole\r\nState over ten tons of lye-dipped raisins have been placed on the market\r\nyearly. But undoubtedly this process is destined to become of\r\nconsiderable importance, especially in localities where the drying of\r\nthe first crop is accomplished with difficulty in the open air. The\r\nfirst and also most important condition in producing superior dipped\r\nraisins is that the grapes should be absolutely ripe. Unripe grapes will\r\nnot produce any good raisins when dipped, but will turn reddish and\r\notherwise become inferior.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dipping Process._--A good location for dipping raisins is by the side\r\nof an irrigation ditch, provided the water in the latter can be depended\r\nupon to flow constantly while the operation of dipping lasts. If not,\r\nthe water must be procured by pumping or by means of pipes from\r\nreservoirs or water-works. Flowing water is of great importance in\r\nproducing good dipped raisins, and is required for the perfect washing\r\nof the grapes. For this purpose, if no ditch is available, a large\r\ntrough may be used to advantage, and so arranged that the water in it\r\ncan be kept changing through a continuous flow. The following is a cheap\r\nand efficient arrangement for dipping in actual use in one of the\r\nlargest raisin vineyards, and can be recommended on account of its\r\ncheapness and easy working: On one side of the trough is a stationary\r\niron kettle with a fireplace underneath. By the trough is also placed an\r\nupright post, about five feet high, and on this balanced a horizontal\r\nbeam with a double motion. It can be raised and lowered at either end,\r\nor swung to the left or right with ease. On one end of the beam is a\r\nhook on which to hang the grape bucket. On the other side of the trough\r\nis a rough assorting table. Two or more buckets are needed. These\r\nbuckets are common galvanized-iron buckets, perforated thickly with\r\nholes, the latter not large enough to let any loose grapes through. In\r\nthe kettle is kept constantly boiling a solution of water and potash.\r\nSoda is not suitable. The very best potash should be used in the\r\nproportion of about one pound to twelve gallons of water. The ripe\r\ngrapes are now brought to the table and emptied in the buckets. A bucket\r\nis then hung on the beam, the latter swung and the bucket for a second\r\nlowered first in the pure water and then in the boiling potash; but it\r\nis immediately withdrawn and immersed in the water-trough. When rinsed\r\nfor a few seconds, the grapes are taken out and spread on common raisin\r\ntrays. If the weather is warm, the trays are stacked one on top of the\r\nother, and the grapes thus prepared are dried in the shade.\r\n\r\nThe rinsing of the fruit before drying is of great importance, and by\r\nfar not sufficiently understood. In Valencia the finest raisins are\r\ntreated that way and thoroughly rinsed before being dipped in the lye.\r\nBut nowhere in Spain are the grapes rinsed in water afterwards, and it\r\nis yet an undecided question if this rinsing improves or injures the\r\nraisins. It is certain that the washing cleanses the berries, as the\r\nwater in the kettle is sometimes dark and dirty; but if it is an\r\nadvantage to deprive the berries of the lye which more or less sticks to\r\nthem is very doubtful. It is well known here that lye-dipped raisins are\r\napt to mold if the rains set in while the drying lasts, while we are\r\ntold that in Spain the dipped raisins do not spoil even if subjected to\r\nseveral showers of rain. From this it will seem as if rinsing after\r\ndipping is not necessary or perhaps even injurious, but that, on the\r\ncontrary, rinsing before dipping is of the utmost importance. It may be\r\npossible that the lye which adheres to the grapes will, in a great\r\nmeasure, prevent them from molding.\r\n\r\nIn Spain no olive oil is used for mixing in the lye, and it is not\r\nlikely that the oil process will come in vogue in California until it is\r\nfully demonstrated that it not only greatly improves the grapes, but\r\nthat it also enables the grower to realize a correspondingly better\r\nprice for his raisins. Those who care to experiment with it cannot do\r\nbetter than to follow the practice as it is used in Smyrna, for a full\r\naccount of which we beg to refer to the article under that heading. We\r\nmight here only point out that the oil-dipped raisins of Smyrna bring\r\nmany times the price of the lye-dipped raisins of Valencia. The\r\narrangement of dipping, kettles, etc., may, of course, be greatly\r\nvaried. Steam may be used for heating the lye and the rinsing water, if\r\nit is desired to keep the latter hot, and regular trays might be used to\r\nhold the grapes, instead of the buckets referred to above. Every grower\r\nwill no doubt vary these appliances to suit his own fancy, and improve\r\nupon the methods of others. As an example of the devices used by another\r\ngrower, we here reproduce the following from an essay on bleaching\r\nraisin grapes, compiled by the chief viticultural officer, and\r\nespecially referring to the system used by Mr. Byron Jackson: “Mr.\r\nJackson places the grapes on a tray made with a frame of iron, which is\r\ncovered with wire gauze with a quarter-inch mesh. The frame projects\r\nupwards on the sides to prevent the fruit floating off while in the dip,\r\nand is made to receive, as a cover, the wooden tray on which the fruit\r\ngoes to the dryer. When dipped and rinsed, the wooden tray is placed\r\nover the dipping tray, and two men transfer the fruit by turning over\r\nthe two.”\r\n\r\nThe length of time required for dipping can only be ascertained by\r\nexperience, and must differ with the strength of the lye, with the heat\r\nof the solution, and with the thickness of the skin of the grapes. Thus\r\nin different localities the strength of the lye and the length of\r\nimmersion must always be different, and may even differ from year to\r\nyear. When properly dipped, the skin of the grapes must show some very\r\nminute cracks, similar to cracks in glass which has been heated and\r\nsuddenly immersed in or sprinkled with ice-cold water. Deep cracks are\r\nnot desirable, as they will cause the juice of the pulp to leak out,\r\nafter which the raisins will sugar. In Valencia the grapes used for\r\ndipping are the various varieties of Muscats, while in Smyrna both\r\nMuscats and Sultanas are used. Corinths are never dipped, as they dry\r\nreadily and make superior raisins without this process.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Drying and Curing._--After the grapes are dipped, they must be\r\nimmediately dried either in the sun, or in sun and shade alternately, or\r\nentirely in the shade. According to the circumstances attending the\r\ndrying of the grapes, the color of the raisins becomes more or less red\r\nor yellow, transparent or opaque. The most perfect amber color is\r\nattained in the shade, while in the sun the color rapidly changes to\r\nreddish, a less desirable color in dipped raisins. The more favorable is\r\nthe weather for drying, the choicer will be the raisins, and the better\r\ntheir color. If the sun is very warm and the chances are otherwise\r\nfavorable for drying, the trays should be exposed to the sun only long\r\nenough to have their dip thoroughly evaporated, and for this purpose one\r\nday in the sun may suffice. After this the stacking of the trays is\r\nadvisable, and only occasionally may the trays be spread if the drying\r\ndoes not proceed rapidly enough. Such shade-dried dipped raisins will\r\nassume a beautiful amber-yellow color, and bring several cents more than\r\nthose exposed to very warm sun. If, however, the weather is not very\r\nwarm, the grapes must be dried in the sun, and the grower has then to be\r\nsatisfied with the color that nature will give to his raisins. Dipped\r\nraisins do not necessarily require turning, as they generally dry well\r\nanyhow in from four to six days in fair weather. For this class of\r\nraisins dryers are very useful to help finish the drying. Such dryers\r\nmust be almost air-tight, as sandstorms would invariably spoil the\r\nraisins, which, on account of their stickiness, are almost impossible to\r\nafterwards cleanse. Dipped raisins should always be dried on their\r\ntrays, and on special drying grounds, which should be so constructed\r\nthat no sand can blow on them, or at least so arranged that in case of\r\nrain the sand from the ground will not be splashed over the trays. In\r\nCalifornia we have at present no such drying-floors, but it will pay any\r\none who intends dipping his grapes to construct them either of bricks,\r\nbituminous rock or lumber.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Stemming, Grading and Packing._--Dipped raisins should be stemmed when\r\nwell dried, and then graded in two grades. The proper receptacles for\r\nthem are either sacks lined with paper, or twenty-pound boxes, in which\r\nthey may be packed without fancy paper, or in the same way as prunes or\r\nother dried fruit. So far no uniform method of packing such raisins has\r\nbeen adopted in this State.\r\n\r\nAs to the usefulness and future of dipped raisins, not much can be said\r\nat present. Our importations of Valencia raisins, which are mostly\r\ndipped, are considerable, and as long as this class of cooking raisins\r\nis in demand, there is no good reason why we should not compete and\r\nendeavor to supply the demand. We can produce them as well as Spain can,\r\nand the only reason why we have not competed with Spain so far is that\r\nsun-dried raisins are so readily produced here, that it has not been to\r\nour advantage to produce anything else. There are, however, many places\r\nin our State which will grow Muscatel grapes of good quality, but with\r\ntoo thick skins to make them proper for sun-dried raisins. For all such\r\nlocalities the dipping process is to be recommended, as it will enable\r\nthe growers to produce marketable raisins, and to profitably supply the\r\ndemand for this variety of raisins now imported to this country from\r\nabroad. In localities with early and copious fall rains, the dipping\r\nprocess will enable the growers to finish quickly before the rains set\r\nin. California dipped second-crop Muscatels and Sultanas have brought as\r\nhigh as seven cents per pound wholesale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PACKING-HOUSE.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUILDINGS AND MECHANICAL APPLIANCES.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Packing-house._--The packing-house should be large and airy and,\r\nwhether it is made of lumber, brick or adobe, it should in preference to\r\nanything else be large. Room is needed at every operation in the\r\npacking-house, and it is hardly possible to get too much of it. So far\r\nno very large and perfect buildings for packing-houses have ever been\r\nerected in California; the raisin industry is too young for that, and\r\neven the best of our buildings are only temporary ones. It is here not\r\npossible nor desirable to give any instructions how to build and arrange\r\na raisin packing-house, as every packer will have his own ideas and his\r\nown necessities in this respect, and not two packers would build alike.\r\nAll we can do here is to refer to what is needed in a general way, in\r\norder that the reader will get some preliminary ideas of what he will\r\nrequire when his raisin vineyard comes in bearing.\r\n\r\nThe packing-house should contain the following apartments: First, the\r\ngeneral packing-room, in which the raisins are assorted and packed. Then\r\nthe sweating-house or equalizing room, in which the boxes are stored for\r\nseveral weeks in order to equalize the moisture in the raisins. Then the\r\nstemming-room, in which the stemming and grading of the loose raisins is\r\ncarried on. Then we have the weighing room, where the raisins are\r\nreceived from the field, and where they are weighed when this is\r\nrequired. There should also be an office and a pasting room, where the\r\nlabels are pasted on the lining paper, and finally there should be\r\nplenty of veranda or shed room all around the building, where boxes of\r\nall kinds can be received and temporarily stored, either before the\r\nraisins are packed, or afterwards when they are ready to be shipped. We\r\nmight also wish to have a room for a box factory, where boxes of all\r\nkinds are nailed up. This can in our climate best be done in the shed or\r\nunder the veranda. The packing-house proper should be as large as all\r\nthe other rooms together. It can hardly be made too large, as during the\r\nlively packing season hundreds of hands will here be busy, each one with\r\nhis special work. The floor of the packing-house should be of matched\r\nlumber, and slanting towards the center, along which should run a small\r\ngutter. Any other material, such as cement, may also be used, the only\r\nobject in view being that the floor can be washed from time to time and\r\nthe dirt carried off through the gutter as readily as possible. The\r\npacking-room should have places for long narrow tables, at which the\r\npacking and assorting is done, and these tables can most conveniently be\r\nrun the whole length of the room. At one end there should be room for\r\nthe presses and the nailing tables, as well as storage room for empty\r\nand full boxes.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Sweating-house._--The sweating-house or sweating-room should\r\nimmediately adjoin the packing-room. It should be built either of\r\nmatched lumber or of brick or adobe, in order that the temperature may\r\nbe kept tolerably even and the moisture confined if necessary. The\r\nsweating-room in the Fresno Raisin and Fruit Packing Co’s house in\r\nFresno is large enough to contain 40 tons of raisins at one time, and is\r\nabout 50 feet square, while the sweating-room on the Forsyth vineyard\r\nmeasures about 35 feet by 50 feet, and is built of brick in two stories,\r\nthe lower one of which is used for raisins, the upper one for storage.\r\nFor those who wish figures, we might state as examples of buildings,\r\nthat the Forsyth packing-house, which also contains a sweating-room but\r\nnot a stemming-room, is 120 feet by 35 feet, and contains besides a\r\nsmall platform outside for the reception of boxes, etc. The Fresno\r\nRaisin and Fruit Packing Co’s building is about 150 feet by 75 feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Raisin Stemmer and Grader.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Stemmer and Grader._--This large machine is a California invention.\r\nThe principle on which it works is that the dry stems are separated by\r\nrevolving the raisins rapidly in a drum made of perforated galvanized\r\niron or of strong galvanized wire. After the stems are separated, the\r\nraisins fall together on screens of wire with various size meshes,\r\nthrough which the smaller berries are separated from the larger berries,\r\nwhile the refuse and broken stems are blown away by a fan. The most\r\nperfect stemmer and grader is the one on the Butler vineyard. The\r\nraisins are first dumped into a hopper below the floor, and from there\r\nthey are run automatically on a belt to the top of the stemmer, where\r\nthey enter the drum. From the drum they fall on the separating screens,\r\nwhich grade them in three grades, each one falling in a box of its own.\r\nSomewhat similar stemmers are seen in all the large vineyards, all run\r\nby steam and large enough to stem and grade from forty to sixty tons of\r\nraisins a day. There is considerable difference as to the ingenuity with\r\nwhich these stemmers are built, some requiring many more hands to run\r\nthem than others. The Butler stemmer requires, part of the time, only\r\none man for its successful running. The Forsyth stemmer stands under a\r\nshed in the open air, apart from the packing-house, in order that the\r\ndust may be freely carried away. The smaller vineyards have stemmers run\r\nby hand, and have separate graders also run by hand, large enough to\r\nstem and grade from five to eight tons of raisins per day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Raisin Lever Press.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Presses._--These are of two kinds, screw presses and lever presses.\r\nThe screw press is much preferable (at least until the lever press may\r\nbe perfected), as with it we can gauge the pressure given the raisins.\r\nThe only press of this kind is found on the Raisina vineyard of T. C.\r\nWhite. The press that is generally adopted, and the one that is most\r\nhandy, is the lever press, which is so constructed that four boxes of\r\nraisins can be kept in the press at one time, or until the last box or\r\npart of a box is ready. By a pressure with the foot, the levers are\r\nreleased and the boxes freed from the pressure. While this press is\r\nexceedingly handy and quickly worked, the pressure cannot readily be\r\ngauged, and the raisins are apt to be injured by too heavy pressure. But\r\nit is likely that improvements will soon be made which will remedy this\r\ndefect.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Boxes and Cartoons._--The California raisin boxes are of three\r\nkinds,--whole boxes of twenty pounds, halves of ten pounds and quarters\r\nof five pounds. The wholes and the quarters are those most used, while\r\nthe halves are seldom used or required. The cartoons are made of paper\r\nand contain two and one-half pounds of raisins each. The following are\r\nthe measurements of raisin boxes and cartoons, and of the lumber\r\nrequired for making them. Twenty-pound box: 9 x 18 x 4¾ inches.\r\nTen-pound box: 9 x 18 x 2⅜ inches. Five-pound box: 9 x 18 x 1³⁄₁₆\r\ninches. The foregoing are inside measurements. The tops and bottoms are\r\none-quarter inch thick, 19½ inches long and 9¾ inches wide. The sides of\r\nthe twenty-pound box are 19½ inches long, 4¾ inches wide and\r\nthree-eighths inches thick. The ends of a twenty-pound box are 9 inches\r\nlong, 4¾ inches wide and three-fourths of an inch thick. The sides of\r\nthe ten-pound box are 19½ inches long, three-eighths of an inch thick\r\nand 2⅜ inches wide. The ends of a ten-pound box are 9 inches long,\r\nthree-fourths of an inch thick and 2⅜ inches wide. The sides of a\r\nfive-pound box are 19½ inches long, three-eighths of an inch thick and\r\n1³⁄₁₆ inches wide. The two and one-half pound cartoon is five inches\r\nwide, ten inches long and one and one-half inches deep.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Packing Frames or Packing Trays._--These are of two kinds, according to\r\nthe method of packing. For the top-up method, wooden frames large enough\r\nto hold five pounds of raisins are used. In length and width these\r\nframes correspond with the raisin box, but in height they are only\r\none-third of a whole box, or about one and one-half inches. The bottom\r\nis a sliding one, and can be pulled out broadwise. The frame is first\r\nlined on the inside with the necessary paper, and then five pounds of\r\nraisins are placed in the paper. A follower or block of wood, large\r\nenough to fill the form or frame, is then placed on top, the frame is\r\nplaced over an empty box, the sliding bottom quickly withdrawn, and the\r\nwhole contents fall in the box below undisturbed. For the top-down\r\nmethod, frames of galvanized iron are used, slightly deeper than the\r\nformer, but the bottom is a drop-bottom, resting on a flange, instead of\r\na sliding bottom, as in the former tray. A loose plate of zinc is placed\r\non top of the frame, the latter is inverted and placed over the box, and\r\nthe zinc plate quickly withdrawn, when the contents covered by the loose\r\ndrop-bottom (or by the facing-plate) fall into the raisin box.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Facing-plate._--This useful tool was invented by T. C. White. It\r\nconsists of a brass plate large enough to fit readily into the bottom of\r\nthe raisin box. In this plate are arranged small cavities, each one wide\r\nenough to hold a large raisin. For large boxes the plate is made to\r\ncontain eleven raisins the short way and eighteen the long way. The\r\nplate is first placed in the bottom of the iron frame in place of the\r\nloose bottom. A raisin is placed in each cavity and lightly pressed, and\r\nloose raisins are carefully filled in on the top. When this frame is\r\nafterwards reversed and the raisins and the plate as follower are\r\nreceived in the box, it will be found that the top layer has retained\r\nits arrangement and is regularly faced. This facing-plate enables the\r\npacker to face quickly and cheaply, but it can only be used when the\r\ntop-down method of packing is used. The standard plate is nine inches by\r\neighteen inches, and the plate for cartoons is five inches by ten\r\ninches, both made of heavy brass.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Scales._--For weighing the quantity of raisins necessary for every\r\nlayer, scales must be found on every weighing table. Any ordinary\r\ngrocery scales which work with springs may be used. Generally one pair\r\nof such scales are used at each end of the assorting table.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Labeling Press._--Of late every large packer labels his boxes before\r\nthey are nailed together. This is done by passing the shooks through a\r\nlabeling press, which prints under pressure the required label on each\r\nside or top, the name, etc., appearing in concave type on their face.\r\nThese presses are run by machinery and work very rapidly.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tables._--In the packing-house are tables of various kinds; they are\r\ngenerally long and narrow, and about four feet wide. The assorting\r\ntables should be furnished with square holes at intervals of five or six\r\nfeet, so that the loose raisins may be scraped through them into boxes\r\nbelow. The assorting and weighing tables are furnished with a low flange\r\nor guard all around, to prevent any raisins falling on the floor.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bags and Bag-holders._--Two kinds of bags are used,--cotton sacks or\r\njute sacks. The former are white like flower sacks, the latter coarser\r\nand brownish. In the former no paper linings are used, but in the latter\r\na paper bag is stitched, in order that the air may not penetrate and dry\r\nthe raisins. Both kinds of bags are used to an equal extent. The cotton\r\nsacks contain either thirty or sixty pounds, while the jute sacks are\r\nmade to contain an average of eighty pounds each. Patented bag-holders\r\nare used everywhere for holding the bags open while they are being\r\nfilled.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Trucks._--For inside work, trucks very similar to those used in the\r\nvineyard are now generally adopted. They are handled with ease, and for\r\nmoving boxes of various kinds are absolutely indispensable in the modern\r\nraisin packing-house.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Trays for Weighing._--These are small, shallow boxes, made of zinc or\r\ntin, and large enough to hold five pounds of raisins each. One short\r\nside of the tray should be slanting outward in order that the raisins\r\nmay fall out readily. They are only used in weighing the raisins which\r\nare to go in each five-pound layer in the whole boxes.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Followers._--These are wooden blocks of the size of a quarter box of\r\nraisins, inside measurement. They should be lined with zinc on the flat\r\nsides, in order that they may be washed readily, and also to prevent the\r\nsugar of the raisins from adhering to them. They should be large enough\r\nto just fit inside a box or frame, and are used to keep the raisins\r\nsteady while being changed from the frame to the box. They are also\r\nplaced on top of the raisin frames when they are being pressed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paper._--Several kinds of paper are used in the raisin business. Heavy\r\nyellow manilla paper is used to place in the sweatboxes, one sheet\r\nbetween every two layers of raisins. The paper should be heavy, and cut\r\nto fit the box. Many growers use too short paper, which always has the\r\ninconvenience of causing the raisins to mix and become entangled. Only\r\none whole sheet of paper should be used at a time; two short sheets will\r\nnot answer, as, in lifting out a layer of raisins, the assorter takes\r\nhold of the four corners of the paper, and thus readily lifts out the\r\nraisin block. Lighter paper for lining the raisin boxes is used, both\r\nfor layers and loose. The paper generally used is common book paper\r\ntwenty-one by twenty-eight inches, and forty, fifty or sixty pounds to\r\nthe ream in quality. Previous to being used, this paper is cut to fit\r\nthe tray, a square piece being cut out of every corner. When placed in\r\nthe tray, the central part of the paper fits the bottom of the tray,\r\nwhile the sides of the paper extend sufficiently over the sides of the\r\ntray to meet on top when folded over the raisins. Waxed tissue paper\r\nshould always be placed on the top of the raisins in order to prevent\r\nthe moisture from the raisins injuring the colored and artistic labels.\r\n\r\nColored lithographs or chromos of various designs and qualities are used\r\nfor all raisins packed in boxes. When bought they come in three sizes.\r\nThe central label should be nearly the size of the face of the box. The\r\ntop labels are shorter pieces, almost as wide as the box, but only a few\r\ninches long. They are previously pasted to the top flaps of the lining.\r\nThe side labels are twice as long as the face of the box, but not quite\r\nhalf as wide; they are similarly pasted on the long side flaps of the\r\nlining. There is a great variety of designs used, some of which are not\r\nappropriate. Whatever designs we use, it will be to the advantage of\r\nevery country not to imitate, but to use labels characteristic of the\r\ncountry and locality where the raisins are made.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tin Boxes._--For packing raisins for tropical countries, boxes made of\r\ntin should be used. The dampness in those countries causes raisins\r\npacked the common way to mold and spoil. No box should contain more than\r\nten pounds of raisins, and the top should be so soldered on that it can\r\nbe removed without cutting or injuring the box. The French system of\r\nsoldering on by means of a narrow strip of tin, which can be wound up,\r\nis admirable, and could hardly be improved upon. Five ten-pound boxes\r\nshould be packed in a _light_ case made of light timber, and the whole\r\npackage when closed should not weigh over sixty pounds. Four such cases\r\nwill make one mule-load, and two such cases can be conveniently carried\r\nby one man.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOOSE RAISINS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Stemming and Assorting._--It must be understood that all the mechanical\r\nappliances and tools mentioned above should now be on hand ready for\r\nuse and properly placed. The several different operations in packing,\r\nstemming, assorting, etc., of both loose and layers, will at times be\r\ncarried on in different parts of the packing establishment at the same\r\ntime, so as to meet the requirements of mixed lots or orders, the\r\ngeneral shipments being of that nature. Loose and layer raisins are\r\nproduced more or less from almost every sweatbox brought into the\r\npacking-house, and the only delay to their being immediately disposed of\r\nis because the layer raisins must be sweated or equalized before they\r\nare ready for use. The loose raisins, provided they are properly or\r\nsufficiently dried, are ready to be handled as soon as brought from the\r\nvineyard. A loose raisin, or a bunch from which loose raisins are to be\r\nmade, must be overdried rather than underdried; at any rate, it must be\r\nso dry, that no juice will come out of it when the raisin is squeezed\r\nheavily or even torn. But a matter of greater importance even is that\r\nthe stems should be brittle or sufficiently dry to break off readily. If\r\nthey do not break, the raisins cannot be easily separated from the stem.\r\nThe stems, instead of breaking off, will tear off, and the raisins will\r\nbe open to the entrance of air, which will cause them to undergo a\r\nchemical change, to sugar and deteriorate.\r\n\r\nAs soon as a perfectly dried sweatbox of third-grade or loose raisins\r\nenters the packing-house, it should be taken to the stemmer. Any delay\r\nin this is injurious to the raisins, as they will rapidly undergo a\r\nsweating or equalizing, causing the stems to soften and to lose their\r\nbrittleness. It will, therefore, be seen that loose raisins must on no\r\naccount be sweated or equalized before they have been stemmed. Besides,\r\nif the raisins are in any way moist, they will not shed the dust and\r\ndirt when being passed through the stemmer. It is therefore to every\r\nraisin-grower’s interest to so hasten the drying of the loose raisins\r\nthat as many of them as possible can be out of the way when the layers,\r\nwhich take longer to dry, come in. This, as we have shown before, can\r\nonly be done by assorting the raisins while green, and at the moment\r\nthey are being picked from the vines. The different size bunches dry at\r\ndifferent times, and the loose can then be partially disposed of when\r\nthe layers are ready. The stemmer and grader should separate the raisins\r\nin at least three grades: Number one, large loose; number two, smaller\r\nloose; number three, smallest seedless, to which may be added a number\r\nfour, or rubbish. The large loose bring always a good price, and great\r\ncare should be taken with them. After having passed through the stemmer\r\nand assorter once, they should be passed through a second or third time,\r\nin order that all the inferior or smaller raisins may be eliminated. In\r\nthis way, a fine, large number one is had, which is sure to give\r\nsatisfaction. Number two loose may be passed through a second time if\r\nthe stemmer has not done its full duty, and the same may also be done\r\nwith number three seedless. It always pays to do a thing well, and this\r\nholds good with raisins as with everything else. Colonel Forsyth, who\r\nhas acquired a high reputation for his loose raisins, advocates and\r\npractices this repeated assorting, especially of the number one grade,\r\nin order that it may be entirely uniform. Too many poor raisins are\r\ngenerally found among the small seedless, and if they are to be made to\r\npartially replace the seedless Sultanas or the Currants in the same\r\nmanner as the number two is expected to replace the imported Valencias,\r\nthey must be made clean from all rubbish. Only by producing a superior\r\narticle can we hope to replace the imported dipped raisins by our loose\r\nMuscatels.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Packing and Cleaning._--The number one and two loose are always put up\r\nin whole boxes of twenty pounds each, never in quarter boxes, but\r\nsometimes in cartoons, to be used as samples or as holiday gifts. In\r\npacking whole boxes, they may either be faced or not. If not faced, the\r\nwork is very simple. The raisins are first brought to a large separate\r\ntable with a guard all around its edges, so as to prevent the raisins\r\nfrom falling to the floor. On each such table are one or more small\r\nscales. The workmen gather the raisins with small shovels, and place\r\nthem in quantities of twenty pounds each in tin trays, with the guards\r\nslanting at one end, in order that the raisins may fall out readily.\r\nThese trays are then immediately carried by other hands to the\r\npacking-table close by. Here the proper papers are being placed in\r\nregular whole raisin boxes, the loose raisins are poured in from the\r\ntrays, and from time to time looked over and cleaned. All poor or\r\ninferior raisins should be carefully eliminated, and only good ones\r\nallowed to be boxed. Finally the paper leaves are folded over, and the\r\nboxes are taken away to be nailed up. Number two undergoes the very same\r\nprocess when packed in boxes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Raisin Truck for Packing-house.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sacking._--A very large trade is springing up in sacked raisins, and\r\nthe demand for them is increasing every year. Both numbers two and three\r\ngrades loose are now exported this way either in cotton sacks, or in\r\njute sacks lined inside with paper. The jute sacks are by many preferred\r\non account of their showing the dirt less, the cotton sacks generally\r\narriving soiled at their destination. If cotton sacks are used for\r\nshipment East, they should be first placed in common burlap sacks, in\r\norder to arrive clean and attractive. The extra expense is not great, as\r\nthe cheapest kind can be used for this purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Facing, Top-up Method._--The facing is quickly done with the aid of\r\nWhite’s facing-plate, but it can also be accomplished without it if the\r\npacker may so desire. The facing-plate, however, is greatly to be\r\npreferred, as we shall show directly. If no plate is used, the operation\r\nis as follows: At the filling table, fifteen pounds of loose raisins are\r\nweighed off directly in the twenty-pound boxes. Then five pounds loose\r\nare weighed separately in a tin tray. The whole boxes are taken to the\r\npacking-table and placed close to the press, one on top of the other,\r\nthe smaller trays, with five pounds each, are brought to the facer, who\r\nnow takes one of the loose wooden frames with a sliding bottom and\r\nplaces in it the necessary papers. He then fills in the five pounds of\r\nloose raisins, smooths and spreads them out, and sees that no bad\r\nberries are among the good ones. This operation may also be performed by\r\ndifferent hands, so as to divide up the work. This is probably the best\r\nand most economical way. The next step is to take the tray to the press\r\nand subject it to a certain pressure, so as to get a smooth upper\r\nsurface on which to face or place the raisins in rows. When this is done\r\nthe tray is taken to the facer. The facer now has in front of him a tray\r\nfilled with the ornamental papers and the five pounds of raisins. The\r\nsurface of the raisins is smooth and even. The next operation is to\r\nplace large raisins in rows on the top surface. A small box with loose,\r\nlarge raisins should be at the side of the facer, who in taking each one\r\nof them at first presses it towards the table with the thumb of either\r\nhand, thus flattening out the raisin in order to make it appear large.\r\nWhen the tray is faced, it may again be subjected to slight pressure,\r\nbut generally this is not needed. The contents of the tray are now\r\ntransferred to the twenty-pound box, which already contains fifteen\r\npounds of loose. These loose raisins, which will be on the bottom of the\r\nbox, are not generally wrapped in paper, although such would very much\r\nimprove their appearance. The box is now ready for nailing. This top-up\r\nmethod is very inferior to the top-down method, as will be described\r\nfurther on. In packing with this method, only the wooden frame with the\r\nsliding bottom is used. The drop-bottom frame is only used for the\r\ntop-down method.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Facing, Top-down Method._--In using this method, the top layer is\r\nfinished first, and the bottom last. The packing is done as follows: In\r\nthe bottom of a tin or galvanized-iron tray, previously described, is\r\nplaced one of White’s facing-plates. As will be remembered, the frame\r\nhas a loose drop-bottom, which falls out as soon as the tray is turned\r\nover. The facing-plate is placed either directly on this loose bottom,\r\nor on the flange supporting it, and always with the facing-cups upward.\r\nThe facer now places loose selected raisins, one in each hollow, presses\r\nhis finger on the raisin and works it in the hollow until it becomes\r\nflattened. When all the cavities are filled, loose raisins are carefully\r\nfilled in until the tray is full, when but a gentle pressure is required\r\nto steady the raisins and make them keep their places. In the meantime,\r\nfifteen pounds of raisins have been put in twenty-pound boxes and\r\n_gently_ pressed. Some packers of choice raisins use a wrapper and label\r\nfor every layer of five pounds, which greatly improves the general\r\nappearance of the box. After all is ready, a loose zinc plate is placed\r\nover the filled frame or tray, the latter is reversed and placed\r\ndirectly over the raisin box, in which has already been placed the\r\nrequired paper wrapper. The zinc plate, which only served to steady the\r\nraisins while the frame was being turned, is now quickly withdrawn, and\r\nthe five-pound faced layer falls down in the box entirely undisturbed,\r\nkept so by the facing-plate which here acted as follower. The box is now\r\nready for nailing, after a label and wax paper have first been placed on\r\ntop of the plate. Without the facing-plate, a skilled facer can face\r\nsome forty boxes a day, while from twenty to thirty boxes is a low\r\naverage. With the facing-plate, the facing can be accomplished with more\r\nspeed and accuracy.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Comparative Value of the Two Methods._--The top-up method has several\r\ndisadvantages. It requires a heavy pressure of the raisins to create a\r\nsmooth, flat surface on which to face. But even if no facing is done,\r\nthe top layer will always be more or less uneven, and requires heavy\r\npressure to make it smooth, and appear well and to advantage. This heavy\r\npressure always bursts many of the raisins, and causes them to sugar and\r\nspoil. It has also another disadvantage, that the facing of the top\r\nlayer can only be done with the fancy paper previously placed in the\r\nbox. In facing and manipulating the raisins, this paper becomes more or\r\nless soiled and wet. In using the top-down method, the paper is placed\r\nin the box at the last moment, just before the final five-pound layer is\r\nemptied from the tray upon the fifteen-pound layer below. I consider\r\nthese advantages so essential that I must strongly indorse the top-down\r\nmethod, and I believe that, in course of time, it will be generally\r\nadopted by all packers who care for the keeping qualities of their\r\nraisins. As to the time and expense required by these two methods, there\r\nis but very little difference. The top-down method is possibly a little\r\nslower and more expensive, but it is by far the better, and the\r\ndifference in expense of packing is not great enough to be taken into\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAYER RAISINS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sweating or Equalizing._--This is a process by which the overdried\r\nraisins are made to attract sufficient moisture from the underdried\r\nraisins in the same box or bunch, and whereby the overdried raisins are\r\nmade moister, while the underdried ones become drier. Equalizing also\r\nmoistens the stems sufficiently to prevent them from breaking when being\r\nhandled. In our California climate, where the air is so dry, this\r\nequalizing process is an absolute necessity, and no first-class raisin\r\npack can be produced without the raisins having first been equalized.\r\nThe word “equalizing” is to be preferred to “sweating,” as the latter\r\nword may be misunderstood as meaning that a certain amount of heat is\r\ndeveloped by storing the raisins. Heat is indeed necessary, but it\r\nshould come from the outside air, not from the inside or from the\r\nraisins. If from the latter the raisins will be in a fair way to become\r\nspoiled. In the foregoing I have described the construction and workings\r\nof the sweathouse. It may be suggested that, if there is no sweathouse\r\non the vineyard, a large sail or canvas may be used as a substitute. The\r\nlatter is simply thrown over the boxes where they are piled\r\nout-of-doors, and answers to some degree in keeping the raisins moist.\r\nBut as this is only a substitute, I shall not dwell longer on its\r\nusefulness. It may, however, be said in favor of this appliance, that\r\nit is used by one of our largest packers, and by him considered as of\r\nequal value if not superior even to a regularly constructed equalizing\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nThe raisins which are to be sweated are only the clusters or layers, and\r\nnot the loose, which as we have seen should at once be taken from the\r\nfield to the stemmer, while the stems are yet crisp and dry. It is\r\ntherefore of importance that the bunches or layers should be separated\r\nfrom the loose already in the field, or, which is much preferable,\r\nbefore they are dried, at the time when they are picked from the vines.\r\nIf the latter is done properly, there will be only a small quantity of\r\nloose which will go in the sweating-house with the layers. The layers\r\nshould at any rate be placed at once in sweatboxes when taken from the\r\ntrays, and between every two layers of bunches there should be a stout\r\nsheet of manilla paper, in order that the bunches may not become mixed.\r\nWhen taken to the sweathouse the boxes should be so placed that air can\r\nenter every one. It will not do to place one box on top of another so as\r\nto cover up the top entirely, as the raisins are then apt to ferment in\r\na very short time, and, before the raisin-packer is aware, whole piles\r\nmay be absolutely spoiled. It is not necessary to place the boxes\r\ncrosswise, as it is enough to allow the short side of each box to\r\noverlap the underlying box a little; sufficient air will then enter. In\r\nvery dry weather the floor of the sweathouse may be sprinkled with\r\nwater, but this is generally not needed, as the underdried raisins will\r\ngive out moisture enough to soften those that are too dry, as well as\r\nthe stems. Every day the sweathouse should be aired, and it is a mistake\r\nto believe that all air should be excluded. If air is not daily\r\nadmitted, the raisins will mold and spoil, and it is even advisable to\r\nkeep a circulation of air constantly through the house during the\r\ndaytime. The attentive packer will soon learn to regulate this, and\r\nnothing but actual experience with his particular sweathouse will enable\r\nhim to decide how much air should be let in and to what extent the doors\r\nshould be closed.\r\n\r\nAt the end of from ten days to three weeks, the equalizing process\r\nshould be over, and the layers ready for further packing. When the boxes\r\nare removed, it will be found that the majority of those raisins which\r\nhad been too moist or underdried have dried sufficiently, while on the\r\ncontrary the overdried raisins, as well as the formerly brittle stems,\r\nwill have acquired sufficient moisture to enable the packer to\r\nmanipulate them without risk of breaking the bunches. The raisins should\r\nbe pliable, and stand moderate pressure without cracking or breaking.\r\nBut while equalizing is an important operation, and one which we cannot\r\ndispense with, it is always to the grower’s interest to so dry his\r\nraisins previously that they will require as little equalizing as\r\npossible, as even the most carefully sweated raisins which have once\r\nbeen overdried will never afterwards equal those which were at once\r\nproperly dried in the field. The overdried raisins will always have a\r\ntougher skin and be inferior in color; but on the other hand they will\r\nkeep better than raisins which have been dried less.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Grading and Weighing._--The next step after the raisins have been\r\nequalized is to remove them to the grading tables. This should not be\r\ndone by dumping the contents of a sweatbox on the table, as in this way\r\nbut very few of the real choice bunches are saved for the packer. If,\r\nhowever, the raisins have been placed carelessly in the boxes, without\r\nsufficient or perhaps without any manilla papers between the layers, the\r\nonly way is to dump out the contents. By first placing the sweatbox on\r\nthe long side, and then turning it over, the raisins are but slightly\r\ndisturbed. But to get these out afterwards from the chunk is the great\r\ndifficulty, and many bunches must necessarily be broken. If, again, the\r\nraisins have been carefully handled and consigned to the sweatboxes,\r\nwith four papers in every box, not counting in the top cover, the care\r\nand handling of the sweatboxes will be much simplified. The sweatbox is\r\nthen placed alongside of the grading table, and each layer with its\r\npaper is lifted out carefully, and placed on the table. The assorting is\r\nnow to begin. The bunches are taken up one by one, all inferior berries\r\nare clipped out, all soft ones are separated and placed in a box by\r\nthemselves to be further dried. As each bunch is examined and cleaned,\r\nit is put in one of the weighing trays resting on small scales at either\r\nend of the table, and, when the scales indicate that five pounds of\r\nraisins are in the tray, the latter is removed to the packing table.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime all loose or inferior bunches are raked down through the\r\nopenings in the grading tables and received in sweatboxes below, to be\r\neither further dried or to be stemmed and graded at once. In packing\r\nseveral grades of layer raisins, the grading of the bunches should be\r\nmade at this table. No great choice in selecting the bunches should be\r\nleft to the packer, as his time should alone be occupied with the\r\npacking of his box. The best way is to have differently colored scales\r\nfor number one and number two layers, and when taking them out of the\r\nsweatbox assort them at once by placing them in different trays. The\r\ngraders can never be too careful. No moist raisins, no small ones, no\r\nred and poor raisins, should ever be allowed among a better quality.\r\nThey will lower the grade of the whole box, while the good quality of\r\nhigh-grade raisins will not raise the grade of a generally poor box.\r\nThus, while the many good raisins in a poor box are not paid for\r\naccording to their value, the few poor raisins which will be\r\naccidentally or carelessly smuggled in a good box will lower the value\r\nof the whole. Few packers will sufficiently understand this, which is\r\nreally the principle of all good packing, and which should be\r\nscrupulously adhered to. Even inferior size berries, if otherwise ever\r\nso good, should be carefully clipped from the large-berried bunches. It\r\nis astonishing how quickly the buyer will notice a few small berries,\r\nand how readily he will ignore the value of the largest raisins in the\r\nbox.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Packing Layers, Top-up Method._--As with packing the loose raisins,\r\nthere are two methods, the top up and the top down. The top-up method\r\ncan be as little recommended in this case as in the former, but as it is\r\nused by many of the packers I will here describe it: The trays\r\ncontaining the five-pound layers are placed in front of the packer on\r\nthe packing table, so as to be within easy reach of the packer. The\r\ntrays or frames with the sliding bottom are now used. The first move is\r\nto place one of the inner paper wrappers in the tray, and next the\r\nlayers are placed in the frame as carefully as possible. There are two\r\nways in vogue in which this is done. One of them is to crowd the raisins\r\nto one side,--“bunch” them, so to say, beginning at one end of the tray\r\nand gradually working towards the other end. This is the _wrong_ way,\r\nwhich I am sorry to say is used by very many packers, who desire speed\r\nabove everything, thus sacrificing care and quality and even appearance.\r\nRaisins packed this way point their ends upwards in a slanting way,\r\nwhich not only detracts from their appearance, but causes them to get\r\nentangled in each other. Such bunches when pressed will generally break,\r\nand, when lifted out of the box afterwards, will be very different from\r\nwhat they were when they were placed there in the first instance. The\r\nraisins, whatever method is used, should always be placed flat on the\r\nbottom of the tray. Care should be taken to arrange them so that they\r\nwill fit, and only _very_ few broken bunches should be allowed to fill\r\nunoccupied corners or spaces in the box. It is better even to leave such\r\nspaces empty than to tear up good bunches in order to get the small\r\nquantities needed, or in using inferior berries to fill up the holes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Riverside, Showing Orange Orchards and Raisin\r\nVineyards.]\r\n\r\nWhen at last the tray is full, and all the five pounds of raisins from\r\nthe weighing tray are in, the upper surface should be smooth so as to\r\nrequire as little pressure as possible. When full the trays are taken to\r\nthe press and stored on a side table until actually used. The presses\r\nare generally arranged for four trays. These are now placed under the\r\npress, a follower is placed on the top of every tray, and only\r\nsufficient pressure applied. Frequently too much pressure is used, and\r\nthe raisins are flattened out to their greatest possible extent, many\r\neven crushed and so broken that the juice runs out. All such crushed\r\nraisins will sugar in a few months, and the whole box containing them\r\nwill spoil and deteriorate in value. If, again, the raisins have been\r\nproperly pressed, they will keep for months or even years. After the\r\ntrays have been sufficiently pressed, which generally is accomplished in\r\none minute’s time, the pressure is released, the follower removed, the\r\nfolders turned over the raisins, and the trays removed to the boxing\r\ntable, on which they may be allowed to accumulate until the boxer is\r\nready to fill his boxes. On this table the final packing or “making up”\r\nof a box is done. It takes four of these five-pound frames to fill one\r\nwhole box. Each tray is in its turn placed over a box, the sliding\r\nbottom is quickly removed, and the five-pound layer drops down in the\r\nbox undisturbed. Every fourth frame should, in addition to the common\r\npaper wrapper, have labels and fancy paper pasted on the folders, or, as\r\nis sometimes done, an extra fancy folder or wrapper is placed on the\r\nthird layer, and on the top or inside of it the fourth layer is dropped.\r\nEach layer will thus be found in its own wrapper, but the upper layer\r\nwill have two, the outside one of which is fancy. Fine layers should\r\nhave a waxed paper immediately above the raisins, in order that the\r\nmoisture or sugar from them may not spoil the labels. On the top of the\r\nwaxed paper the chromo or label is placed. The box is now ready for\r\nnailing.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Packing Layers, Top-down Method._--This method I advocate as the most\r\nproper one to use. Thin galvanized-iron trays with a drop bottom are\r\nused. On the top of the drop bottom is placed a heavy follower of metal.\r\nWhite’s facing-plate, turned over, can be used to great advantage, even\r\nwhere no facing is required. The choicest bunches are now selected and\r\nspread evenly on the bottom of the tray; other bunches are placed on top\r\nof them, and so on until the tray is full. Great care must be taken in\r\npacking so as to make the bunches fit each other and lie solid;\r\notherwise they are very apt to be disturbed, or they will require too\r\nheavy pressure to be kept in place. When the tray is full, it is gently\r\npressed, and the pressure kept up for a few seconds. A loose zinc plate\r\nis then placed over the tray, the latter is turned over and placed over\r\nthe box, in which the necessary wrapping papers have been previously\r\nplaced, the loose zinc plate is quickly withdrawn, and the contents fall\r\ninto the box. The heavy follower keeps the top layer steady, and with a\r\nlittle care the raisins are not disturbed.\r\n\r\nThe top-down method for packing layers has the following advantages over\r\nthe top-up method. It gives a smooth surface on which to pack the top\r\nlayer, without necessitating pressure to first create such a surface,\r\nthe packing being done on a hard plate. The wrappers are not soiled, as\r\nthey are not first placed in the frames. The packer is enabled to pack\r\nand select his choicest bunches for the top layer while he has plenty to\r\nselect from, and any odd berries and broken or smaller bunches come\r\nnaturally in the bottom of each layer. In the top-up method all such\r\nodds remain for the top, where they _must_ go in, in order to make up\r\nthe required five pounds.\r\n\r\nA raisin-packer averages seventy-five trays of five pounds each per day,\r\nfor which she is paid two cents each. Some pack more than this; but very\r\nexcellent packing proceeds slower, and a packer of very choice layers\r\ncan only pack twenty-five trays of five pounds each per day, for which a\r\ncorrespondingly higher price is paid. In Malaga, a trained and expert\r\npacker receives between two and three dollars per day. In California,\r\nthey do not receive any more. In our raisin district, the girls are\r\nrapidly becoming expert packers, and the same ones are reëngaged year\r\nafter year by the same packing-house.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Filling._--The filling of the raisins is a trick to make them appear\r\nlarger than they are. This filling was invented in Spain, and is used\r\nthere especially on Dehesa boxes and where very expensive packing is\r\nrequired. It is done in the following manner. The raisin is first\r\nflattened out as much as possible, then the edges are bent, making the\r\nraisins slightly concave. In placing the concave side downwards, a\r\nsmaller raisin is slipped underneath so as to cause the manipulated\r\nraisin to keep its shape. These filled raisins are used for facing only.\r\nThe Spanish filled raisins have been handled to such an extent that all\r\nthe bloom is lost, and the raisin looks anything but attractive. The\r\nCalifornia method of filling is a great improvement on the Spanish way.\r\nWhen the facing-plate is used, the raisin is first placed in a cavity\r\non the plate, then worked out by a pressure with the finger, and when\r\nsufficiently concave another raisin is dropped in the hollow and pressed\r\ntightly. The faced raisin is thus filled, and when seen from the other\r\nside will appear much larger than otherwise. When, again, the top-up\r\nmethod of packing is used, a small block of wood may be employed. This\r\nblock contains a single cavity of the size, that a raisin when pressed\r\nwill fill it. The counterpart of this block is furnished with a convex\r\nprotuberance, and when the two halves are placed together with a raisin\r\nbetween, and pressure is brought to bear, the raisin flattens out and\r\nbecomes concave just enough to receive the filling.\r\n\r\nIn this way no handling with the fingers is done, and the raisin keeps\r\nits bloom undisturbed. Nothing is more attractive than a raisin with its\r\nbloom untouched; similarly the raisin that has lost its bloom always\r\ngives the buyer an idea that it has been fingered. Its appetizing\r\nquality is gone. Spanish Dehesas are generally both faced and filled.\r\nSome objection to this method is that it deceives, but as long as people\r\nnot only are willing to be deceived but are actually anxious to pay for\r\nthe deception, there is no reason why the filling should not be used.\r\nThe deception, besides, is a very innocent one. It has also another\r\nexcuse: A well faced and filled box is really a work of art; it will\r\nhelp to educate the people up to the appreciation of what fine raisins\r\nand fine packing should be. Filling and facing combined are practiced\r\nbut little in California, and it is doubtful if filled facing will ever\r\ngrow in much demand here.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nailing and Trimming._--The boxes are next moved to the nailing table.\r\nTwo nails are put in the short sides and two in the long sides of the\r\ncover. The boxes when nailed are passed to the trimmer, who with a\r\ndrawknife trims the edges and cuts off the comers diagonally. The latter\r\nprevents the boxes or covers from splitting. The best nails are French\r\nwire nails for the sides and ends, one and one-quarter inches long, and\r\nfor tops and bottoms one inch long.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Labels._--I cannot finish this part without adding some words about our\r\nlabels. It is of importance that our labels and colored lithographs\r\nshould be appropriate. The time has come when our raisins should stand\r\nupon their own merits, and should be designated with appropriate names.\r\nI should wish to see only California names used, California layers\r\ninstead of London layers, California scenes instead of foreign scenes,\r\nwhich give no idea of our conditions, and which do not help to advertise\r\nour State and its resources. Whatever our labels may represent, they\r\nshould be distinctly Californian. Another point which is but seldom\r\nobserved on these labels is the shape and color of our raisin grapes.\r\nThe latter are often represented on the labels, but their shape is\r\nseldom observed. Nowhere have we seen on them a true Gordo Blanco or a\r\ntrue Muscat of Alexandria represented, the grapes there pictured being\r\nimpossible as raisin grapes, or even well-known wine or table grapes,\r\nout of which no raisins could be made. The packer has a right to protest\r\nagainst such misrepresentations of our fair grapes, especially as the\r\nlithographer could just as readily and just as cheaply have followed\r\nthe originals. A beautiful label is well worth its price. As a work of\r\nart, it is seldom thrown away, but is carefully kept and made to adorn\r\nthe walls of many a humble home, in which the name and fame of our State\r\nwill soon be a household word. Let these labels go out by the million\r\nyearly to tell of our climate and of our soil, and of the land where the\r\nluscious raisins are produced, with the same care as apples or garden\r\nstuff in countries less favored by nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATISTICS OF IMPORTATION, PRODUCTION AND PRICES.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Production of Raisins in California from to 1889:_\r\n\r\n         Twenty-\r\n          pound\r\n          boxes.\r\n  1873     6,000\r\n  1874     9,000\r\n  1875    11,000\r\n  1876    19,000\r\n  1877    32,000\r\n  1878    48,000\r\n  1879    65,000\r\n  1880    75,000\r\n  1881    90,000\r\n  1882   115,000\r\n  1883   140,000\r\n  1884   175,000\r\n  1885   500,000\r\n  1886   700,000\r\n  1887   800,000\r\n  1888   963,000\r\n  1889 1,000,000\r\n\r\nThe California crop, from 1885 to 1889, was divided between the various\r\nraisin districts of the State about as follows:\r\n\r\n  ==============================+=======+=======+=======+=======+=======\r\n                                | 1885. | 1886. | 1887. | 1888. | 1889.\r\n  ------------------------------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------\r\n  Fresno                        |107,000|225,000|350,000|440,000|475,000\r\n  Riverside and San Bernardino  |129,000|195,000|190,000|270,000|265,000\r\n  Orange County and Los Angeles}|139,000|180,000| 85,000| 42,000|  8,000\r\n  County                       }|       |       |       |       |\r\n  Woodland and Davisville       | 67,000| 75,000|125,000 115,000|120,000\r\n  San Diego                     | 10,000| 25,000| 20,000| 40,000| 75,000\r\n  Tulare                        |  6,000|  8,000| 10,000| 11,000| 15,000\r\n  Kern                          |   --  |   --  |   --  |   --  |  4,000\r\n  Scattering                    | 12,000| 15,000| 20,000| 25,000| 25,000\r\n                                +-------+-------+-------+-------+-------\r\n                                |470,000|723,000|800,000|943,000|987,000\r\n  ------------------------------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------\r\n\r\n\r\n_Number of Acres in Raisin Grapes in California in 1890:_\r\n\r\n  Fresno district                    30,000 acres.\r\n  Balance of San Joaquin valley      10,000   “\r\n  San Bernardino district             5,000   “\r\n  San Diego and El Cajon              6,000   “\r\n  Yolo and Solano                     8,000   “\r\n  Balance of the State                7,000   “\r\n                                     ------\r\n                                     66,000   “\r\n\r\nThis includes grapes in bearing, as well as vines lately set out.\r\n\r\n\r\n_California and Malaga Prices, Importations, etc., from 1871 to 1889:_\r\n\r\nThe following statistics of prices of California and Malaga raisins have\r\nbeen mostly compiled from various sources, such as the Fresno\r\n_Expositor_, the San Francisco _Journal of Commerce_, the _Fruit\r\nGrower_, etc. These statistics and notes will give a fair idea of the\r\nprogress made by the raisin industry in this State since 1873, the year\r\nwhen our raisins first cut any conspicuous figure in the market of this\r\ncontinent. The first struggle of the raisin-producers of this Coast was\r\ndirected against the importers of Malaga raisins, and against the\r\nprejudice of our own consumers. It took about ten years to supersede the\r\nMalaga product by our own. The following table gives the importation of\r\nMalaga raisins to this State from 1871 to 1884:\r\n\r\n          Twenty-\r\n           pound\r\n           boxes.\r\n  1871     16,534\r\n  1872     36,153\r\n  1873     27,692\r\n  1874     35,447\r\n  1875     22,228\r\n  1876     29,187\r\n  1877     13,357\r\n  1878     14,824\r\n  1879     10,884\r\n  1880      3,988\r\n  1881      1,719\r\n  1882      1,218\r\n  1883        633\r\n  1884      1,437\r\n  1885        800\r\n  1886       --\r\n  1887       --\r\n  1888       --\r\n  1889       --\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that the imports began to fall off in 1875, being\r\nthat year more than 13,000 boxes short of the preceding year. In 1876\r\nthe importations struggled back to 29,187, still being more than 6,000\r\nboxes short of the importations of 1874; and then the battle was\r\npractically won, for in the succeeding years the importations dwindled\r\naway until in 1883 only 633 boxes were imported. The figures from 1886\r\nto date are not obtainable, but are so insignificant as to be considered\r\nunnecessary to record.\r\n\r\n\r\n_1873._--In 1873 the market was liberally supplied with Malaga raisins,\r\nwhich brought at wholesale the following prices: Layers, whole boxes,\r\n$3.00 to $3.75; half boxes, $3.62½; quarters, $3.75; eighths, $4.00 to\r\n$4.25; London layers, $4.50.\r\n\r\n\r\n_1874._--Coming down to 1874, the Malaga still holds the fort, layers\r\nbringing $3.25 for whole boxes, and $3.12½ for half boxes, with the\r\ncustomary advance on fractions. In all this time the California raisin\r\nwas too insignificant for notice, and was not quoted by commercial\r\npapers.\r\n\r\n\r\n_1875._--On January 14, 1875, this significant comment appears in the\r\n_Journal of Commerce_: “A decided change is being wrought in the markets\r\nof this coast respecting the use of Malaga raisins, figs, Zante\r\ncurrants, Hungarian prunes, almonds, walnuts, etc. In fact, from this\r\ntime forward Pacific Coast supplies of bunch raisins and dried fruits\r\ngenerally are to be produced here in large quantities, and in favorable\r\nseasons we will doubtless have a large surplus of almonds (hard, soft\r\nand paper shells), English walnuts, chestnuts, hickory nuts, raisins,\r\nfigs, etc.”\r\n\r\nOn November 4, 1875, it was recorded that up to the 1st of November\r\nthere had been received 6,000 boxes of California raisins, “the quality\r\ngenerally good,” worth from eight to ten cents per pound, say $2.00 and\r\n$2.25 per box of twenty-two pounds net; London layers, $3.50 and $3.75.\r\n\r\n\r\n_1876._--In January of 1876 Malagas were quoted at $3.25 and $3.50,\r\nCalifornia raisins bringing ten and twelve and one-half cents per pound.\r\nThe following comment was made at that time, which may be considered as\r\nanother mile-stone in the progress of the California industry: “Malaga\r\nraisins have been imported to very much less extent the present than\r\nlast season, owing to the large products of California cured, which\r\nlatter have amounted to upwards of 30,000 boxes, about one-half of which\r\nhave been of prime quality, suitable for table use, a portion being\r\npoorly cured and considerably inferior to the imported, but have sold at\r\nlower rates for ordinary cooking purposes.”\r\n\r\nThe California raisin was now fairly on its feet, so to speak, and was\r\nin lively competition with the Malaga dried grape. The market reports\r\nspoke well of Blowers’ California Muscatels and Briggs’ bunch raisins.\r\nThe jobbers, however, were loth to give up the Malaga; but to sell that\r\narticle they had to import an extra choice quality, as the public was\r\nbeginning to show a marked preference for the home product. In proof of\r\nthis the following extract, dated November 9, 1876, is given: “The\r\nquality of the Malaga raisins now here is superior to any ever before\r\nimported, and have a preference over our best California raisins. This,\r\nhowever, will not always be the case, as experience makes perfect, and\r\nin a few years we will be entirely independent of the Old World for all\r\nsorts of dried fruits.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_1877._--In November, 1877, very complimentary notice is made of\r\nBlowers’ layer raisins from Woodland, which brought $2.75 and $3.00 per\r\nbox. Briggs’ raisins were worth $2.25 and $2.70. This extract, dated\r\nJanuary 18, 1877, is still another landmark in the raisin industry: “The\r\nconsumption of raisins has been fully up to the average of past years,\r\nyet divided between Malaga imports and our own California production. Of\r\nthe latter, upwards of 20,000 boxes have been already marketed; and, had\r\nit not been for the unusual and unexpected heavy rainfall in October,\r\nthere is every reason to believe that our home crop of bunch and layer\r\nraisins would have reached 50,000 boxes of twenty pounds each. Blowers’\r\nMuscat raisins were superior and in every way equal to the imported.\r\nBriggs, of Marysville, also turned out several thousand boxes of bunch,\r\nand others have made a creditable beginning. Enough has been done here\r\nin this line to satisfy our grape-growers that raisin-curing is to be,\r\nin the near future, a prominent California interest, and, to do it\r\nsuccessfully, the sun-drying process is infinitely superior to that of\r\nmachine-drying. Sheds must be erected and prepared in time to protect\r\nthe fruit from early rain, and then the working process is sure to all\r\nwho have the right kind of grapes. Then uniform weight in twenty, ten\r\nand five pound boxes, all handsomely put up in fancy papered boxes, and\r\nCalifornia then will be prepared to secure all the raisin trade west of\r\nthe Rocky Mountains, and a good part of that of the Eastern States. As\r\nit is, those of our merchants importing Malaga raisins from New York\r\nconfine themselves to London layers and others of the best and choicest\r\nquality, leaving the home market to be cared for, in a great measure, by\r\nthose of our own production. As a result, raisins have ruled low all the\r\nwinter, and are likely to do so for a long time to come.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_1878._--In 1878 several carloads of California raisins were sent to\r\nChicago, New York and Boston, and were well received by the trade. In\r\nOctober of that year, California layers were bringing $2.50 and $3.25.\r\nImports had fallen away more than forty per cent from the figures of\r\n1874.\r\n\r\n\r\n_1879._--In 1879 the ruling prices for California raisins, in lots of\r\n250 boxes and upwards, were: Common layers, $2.00 for wholes, $2.25 for\r\nhalves, $2.50 for quarters, $3.00 for eighths; London layers, $2.25 to\r\n$2.50 for wholes, $2.50 to $2.75 for halves, $2.75 to $3.00 for\r\nquarters, $3.25 to $3.50 for eighths.\r\n\r\n\r\n_1880._--In October, 1880, the following quotations were made: Briggs’\r\nlayers, $2.00 and $2.75 per box. California raisins, in lots of 250\r\nboxes and upwards, common layers, $2.50 and $2.25 per box; London\r\nlayers, $2.50 per box.\r\n\r\n\r\n_1881._--In November of 1881, Malaga ruled high in the East, and in\r\nconsequence prices were generally higher here, quotations for the\r\nCalifornia article running $2.50 for wholes, $2.75 for halves, $3.00 for\r\nquarters, and $3.25 for eighths, in lots of one hundred boxes. London\r\nlayers, twenty-five cents per box more.\r\n\r\n\r\n_1882._--In 1882 prices ran $2.37½ and $2.75. During all the period just\r\nreviewed, the duty was two and a half cents per pound on raisins; but in\r\nMarch, 1883, the duty was reduced to two cents, and yet importations for\r\nthat year were only 633 boxes,--a rather singular fact. The reduction in\r\nduty does not seem to have had a very bad effect on prices, because, as\r\nis easily evident from the small importation, no competition to speak of\r\nwas encountered in the local market, and, as in that year the imports at\r\nNew York from Spain were many thousands of boxes short, Eastern\r\ncompetition was reduced to a minimum. Prices here ruled through the year\r\nat an average of from seven to eight cents a pound, anything especially\r\nchoice bringing better prices.\r\n\r\n\r\n_1883._--In 1883 California made a big stride forward in packing and\r\ncuring, and fancy raisins were put up in layers and cartoons. The Dehesa\r\nbrand and other fancy brands made their appearance, and as high as one\r\ndollar was paid for quarters of five pounds each, and T. C. White’s and\r\nMiss Austin’s brands became famous.\r\n\r\n\r\n_1884._--In 1884, the year following that in which the duty was reduced\r\nto two cents, the following prices prevailed:\r\n\r\nIn January the following quotations are recorded: Malaga layers, $3.50\r\nfor wholes, $5.00 for halves, and $5.50 for quarters in frames. Valencia\r\nraisins, fifteen cents per pound. Loose Muscatels, $1.60. London layers,\r\n$4.00. Briggs, wholes $2.50,--usual advance of twenty-five cents on\r\nfractions. Blowers, wholes $----, quarters $3.50, eighths $3.75. Other\r\nraisins, $2.50 in large lots; quarter and eighth boxes twenty-five cents\r\nhigher.\r\n\r\nIn August the following were the quotations: Malaga layers, $3.50 for\r\nwholes, $4.00 for halves, and $4.50 for quarters in frames. Valencias,\r\nfifteen cents per pound. Loose Muscatels, $1.90. London layers, $3.00.\r\nBriggs, wholes $1.40, halves $1.75, quarters $2.25, eighths $2.75.\r\nBlowers, wholes $2.25, halves $2.50, quarters $2.75, eighths $3.00.\r\n\r\nIn October the following quotations are to be found: Common layers,\r\n$1.00 to $1.25 for wholes, $1.50 for halves, $1.75 for quarters, $2.25\r\nfor eighths. London layers, $1.35 to $1.50 for wholes, $1.95 for halves,\r\n$2.00 for quarters, $2.50 for eighths.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1884, the following comment is made: The California raisin\r\npack will probably be 100,000 boxes. There would have been much more but\r\nfor the October rains, that prevented proper curing. The crop in Europe\r\nis short, too, and prices are much higher than they were a year ago. It\r\nis said that 15,000 boxes have been sold for the East. We quote: Malaga\r\nlayers, $3.75 for wholes, $4.00 for halves, and $4.50 for quarters in\r\nframes. Valencia raisins, fifteen cents per pound. Loose Muscatels,\r\n$1.90. London layers, $4.00. Briggs, wholes $1.75, halves $2.00,\r\nquarters $2.35 to $2.50. Blowers, wholes $2.00, halves $2.25, quarters\r\n$2.50, eighths $2.75. California layers, wholes $1.50, halves $1.75,\r\nquarters $2.00.\r\n\r\n\r\n_1885._--In 1885 the market showed a gratifying ability to absorb at\r\nprofitable rates a good article, for prices ran: California common\r\nlayers, $1.75 for wholes, $2.00 for halves, $2.25 for quarters. Briggs,\r\nwholes $2.00, with an advance of twenty-five cents on fractions.\r\nBlowers, $2.25 for wholes, with an advance of twenty-five cents on\r\nfractions.\r\n\r\n\r\n_1886._--In 1886 quotations show that only extra choice Malagas were\r\nimported, and that, too, for a limited trade. Prices were: Malaga\r\nlayers, $4.00 for wholes, $4.25 and $4.75 for halves and quarters.\r\nValencia raisins, fifteen cents per pound. London layers, $3.00.\r\nCalifornia layers, wholes $1.75,--usual advance of twenty-five cents on\r\nfractions. Briggs, wholes $2.00, halves $2.25, etc. Blowers, wholes\r\n$2.25,--usual advance on fractions.\r\n\r\nFor 1886 the market is reviewed as follows: The past year has been the\r\ngreatest for California dried fruit that the State has ever seen. There\r\nhas been an increase in every item, and a specially heavy increase in\r\nthe matter of raisins, the production of which has increased so fast\r\nthat they have become a leading article of merchandise. Where we were\r\nlarge importers and generous consumers, more in proportion to our size\r\nthan any one else in the world, we have almost totally ceased\r\nimportation and are among the largest producers and exporters in the\r\nworld, next to Spain itself. The total receipts of imported raisins at\r\nNew York for the season of 1886-87 were as follows: 911,816 boxes of\r\nValencias, 427,936 boxes of Malagas, 400 half boxes of Malagas, 88,657\r\nboxes of Sultanas. The California pack is this year almost doubled, and\r\nshows great improvement in quality and packing.\r\n\r\n\r\n_1887._--In October, 1887, prices were quoted as follows: London layers,\r\nper box, $2.00 to $2.25. Loose Muscatels, from $1.50 to $1.80.\r\n\r\nRiverside, El Cajon and Fresno raisins of excellent quality are now in\r\nthe market, and Butler and Forsyth raisins in Fresno begin to rival the\r\nvery best imported brands. Many large packing-houses are established in\r\nFresno, Riverside and El Cajon.\r\n\r\n\r\n_1888._--The pack reaches in California 850,000 boxes, and the Fresno as\r\nwell as the Riverside raisins are very large and choice. Forsyth and\r\nButler raisins take the lead, some of the choicest layers bringing as\r\nhigh as one dollar per five-pound quarter box. Only 112,000 boxes of\r\nMalaga raisins are imported to the United States.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1888, the following prices were obtained for imported\r\nraisins at auction sale in New York: 645 boxes best London Layers, $3.25\r\nto $3.12½; 348 Imperial Cabinets, $3.35 to $3.20; 200 fine Dehesa\r\nBunches, $4.50 to $3.75; 50 Imperial Dehesa Bunches, $5.65; 104 Dehesa\r\nBunches, $4.05 to $4.00; 100 Finest Selected Clusters, $4.45 to $4.40;\r\n50 Finest Royal Clusters, $4.75; 3 Imperial Excelsior Dehesa Loose\r\nMuscatels, $5.00; 140 Imperial Loose Muscatels, $3.30 to $2.15; 1\r\nImperial Excelsior Dehesa Clusters, $5.50; 9 Imperial Dehesa Clusters,\r\n$5.12½ to $5.00; 2 Dehesa Dessert Fruit, $4.10; 1,194 Finest Valencia\r\nLayers, 8⅛ to 8 cents; 899 Finest Valencia Raisins, 7 to 6¾ cents; 150\r\nhalf boxes Finest Valencia Layers, 8⅛ to 8 cents; 246 boxes Finest\r\nSultanas, 8¼ to 8 cents.\r\n\r\nAt the same time California layers were quoted at from $1.80 to $2.25\r\nfor medium grades, while for Dehesa and Imperial quarter boxes from\r\neighty cents to one dollar were realized. Raisins in sweatboxes were\r\nbought by packers at five cents per pound, prices not rated according to\r\nquality.\r\n\r\n\r\n_1889._--The crop of 1889 was not as large as at first calculated, on\r\naccount of loss through unusual and heavy rains. It was especially the\r\nsecond crop which suffered. The first crop was good, and brought good\r\nprices, average layers bringing from $1.75 to $2.25 per box of twenty\r\npounds. Great improvement is made in packing and labels, and our average\r\nraisins are better than the average imported Malagas. Our choicest\r\nlayers, however, do not yet equal in size, curing and packing the\r\nchoicest Malagas, and no efforts have been made to compete with them.\r\nThere are at least four higher grades packed in Malaga which we do not\r\nproduce here. During last season raisins in sweatboxes have ruled higher\r\nthan before, and have been bought by packers at from three to seven\r\ncents.\r\n\r\n\r\n_1890 (to July)._--The crop promises to be as large as last year. It is\r\ngreatly in demand, and representatives of Eastern and California dealers\r\nhave already bought up the most of the coming crop at prices averaging\r\none-half a cent more per pound than last year.\r\n\r\nFrom the above statistics we learn that through the production of\r\nraisins in California the price of sun-dried raisins to the consumer on\r\nthis coast has been lowered from $3.00, $3.75, $4.00 and $4.50 in 1873\r\nto $2.00 and $2.50 in 1890. The importation of Malaga raisins in the\r\nUnited States has greatly diminished, while that of Valencia or “dipped”\r\nraisins has increased. In 1873, the United States imported 35,271,312\r\npounds of raisins, for which it paid $2,292,948, while in 1888 our\r\nimportation was 40,340,117 pounds, or about five million pounds more,\r\nfor which we paid $2,098,503, or about $200,000 less.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Exports of Valencia Raisins from 1850 to 1889, according to English\r\nestimates:_\r\n\r\n  =====+========+========+========+=======\r\n

Total\r\nPopulation in 1884:_\r\n\r\n  United Kingdom of Great Britain. 4.38 pounds.\r\n  United States of North America.  1.70    “\r\n\r\n\r\n_Prices Ruling in the California Raisin Districts:_\r\n\r\nIt is not my intention to give here a regular prospective estimate of\r\nthe cost of a raisin vineyard and the profits to be derived therefrom.\r\nSuch an estimate, applicable to every case, cannot be made out; about it\r\nnot two raisin-growers with equal experience would agree. Below I simply\r\ngive isolated statistics of costs of the various operations necessary in\r\nthe raisin industry. Each one can figure for himself, and my advice is\r\nto add liberally to the calculated expenses, if disappointment would be\r\navoided.\r\n\r\nAs to the profits of a raisin vineyard, the reader will by this time\r\nunderstand how it might vary, how it must depend upon nice little\r\ncircumstances, never foreseen and only to be taken advantage of or\r\ncounteracted by the experienced grower. The high statements which have\r\nbeen given in these pages as samples of how much might be gained from an\r\nacre of raisin-vines can never be counted on as regular. From fifty to\r\nseveral hundred dollars per acre may be obtained as net profit by care,\r\nskill and favorable circumstances, but an average of seventy-five\r\ndollars per acre can be considered a conservative sum, which the owner\r\nof a good irrigated vineyard may calculate on as a safe net profit. Many\r\ndo not reach even that. But, even with that profit per acre, how many\r\nhorticultural industries can be counted on to produce better results?\r\nVery few, if any. For the benefit of those who desire figures to guide\r\nthem, the following statistics are offered. They have been carefully\r\ncompiled in company with T. C. White, one of the most prominent\r\nraisin-growers the State has ever had. These statistics refer especially\r\nto the Fresno district, but they will be found to differ but little from\r\nthose elsewhere in this State.\r\n\r\nLand suitable to raisins can be had at from fifty to two hundred dollars\r\nper acre. No one not thoroughly acquainted with the requirements of\r\nraisin land should attempt to rely on his own judgment alone in making a\r\nselection.\r\n\r\nVines, already rooted, at from ten to twenty dollars per thousand vines.\r\nAn average would be fifteen dollars. The cost of _rooting_ vines is from\r\none dollar to two dollars and fifty cents per thousand, according to\r\nlocality and circumstances.\r\n\r\nCuttings, from two to three dollars per thousand, more or less,\r\naccording to size and quality.\r\n\r\nPlanting rooted vines, one cent per vine. Planting cuttings, half a cent\r\nper cutting.\r\n\r\nPlowing yearly, one dollar and fifty cents per acre.\r\n\r\nHarrowing, fifty cents per acre.\r\n\r\nLeveling land for irrigation, according to the quality of the land.\r\nLeveling the land in from one-half to three-quarter acre checks,\r\nincluding small ditches, etc., can be done for from ten to fifteen\r\ndollars per acre, if the land is fair. Rougher land will cost\r\ntwenty-five dollars or thereabouts, and if the land is rolling and\r\ncontains hardpan the expense may reach from fifty to one hundred dollars\r\nper acre. The more “naturally” level the land is the better suited it is\r\nto raisin-vines under irrigation.\r\n\r\nIrrigation and cultivation, until the vines come into bearing, including\r\nsuckering and pruning, all in large tracts of from forty to one hundred\r\nacres, ten dollars per acre. If in smaller tracts the expense will be\r\nlarger.\r\n\r\nPruning when the vines are in bearing, from two to three dollars per\r\nacre.\r\n\r\nSulphuring twice, two dollars per acre. Sulphur costs from two to three\r\ncents per pound. It takes about one ton to twenty-five acres and one man\r\ncan sulphur from five to six acres a day.\r\n\r\nTopping, about fifty cents per acre.\r\n\r\nTrays, twenty-four by thirty-six inches, cost ten cents in shooks,\r\nnailing one cent, nails one cent, total about twelve cents per tray.\r\n\r\nSweatboxes, fifty cents apiece when ready.\r\n\r\nPacking-boxes: Wholes of twenty pounds, in shooks, six cents, nailing\r\nand nails two cents, total eight cents each. Halves of ten pounds, in\r\nshooks, four cents, nailing and nails one and one-half cents, total five\r\nand one-half cents. Quarter boxes of five pounds, in shooks, three and\r\none-half cents, nailing and nails one and one-half cents, total five\r\ncents each.\r\n\r\nTwenty pounds of layer raisins will contain about one-half pound of\r\nstems.\r\n\r\nCost of curing cannot be calculated. It depends upon the manner in which\r\nit is done.\r\n\r\nPicking: One man can pick from twenty-five to fifty trays of twenty\r\npounds each a day, at a cost of say from two to three cents per tray, or\r\nabout a half a ton of grapes a day, equal to a cost per ton of two\r\ndollars and fifty cents. This places the grapes on the trays, but does\r\nnot assort them. By assorting the grapes when picking, the cost is\r\nincreased, but better raisins and more good raisins are obtained.\r\n\r\nTurning: Two men can turn twenty acres of grapes a day.\r\n\r\nPacking London Layers: One man can pack “carefully” ten wholes or forty\r\ntrays (of five pounds each) per day. Cost about twelve and a half cents\r\nper box.\r\n\r\nPacking Dehesas: One man can pack ten quarters of five pounds each a\r\nday. Cost twelve and one-half cents per quarter box. This includes\r\nfacing.\r\n\r\nPacking Loose: One man can pack one hundred boxes per day.\r\n\r\nFacing-plate (T. C. White’s): Large plate, size nine by eighteen inches,\r\nfive dollars per plate. Cartoon plate, size five by ten inches, two\r\ndollars and fifty cents per plate.\r\n\r\nManilla paper for sweatboxes, one hundred and fifty pounds per ream at\r\nfifteen dollars per ream, size thirty-six by forty-eight. The sheets to\r\nbe cut in two to fit the boxes.\r\n\r\nStemming: Steam stemmers can separate and assort fifty tons a day. Hand\r\nstemmers run by two men can separate about five tons per day.\r\n\r\nPapers for boxes cost, according to quality, three cents per box, more\r\nor less.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHROUGH THE CALIFORNIA RAISIN DISTRICTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHROUGH SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY TO FRESNO.\r\n\r\nWe are on our way up the valley. The train left San Francisco in the\r\nmorning. We have crossed the bay and rounded the Contra Costa Mountains,\r\nand Mount Diablo, with its majestic twin peaks, lies already behind us.\r\nWe have just crossed the San Joaquin river not far from its mouth; the\r\nwest side of the valley is on our right; on the left looms up the Sierra\r\nNevada, far away it is true, but grand and imposing, gradually\r\ndecreasing, as it were, towards the south, finally to disappear among\r\nthe clouds at the farther end of the valley. It is in the middle of\r\nAugust; the day is warm, but there has been a shower in the mountains,\r\nas is usual at this season of the year, a sprinkling of rain has\r\npurified the atmosphere in the foothills, which stand out clear and\r\nbright, a contrast to the dusty road in the center of the valley, over\r\nwhich the smoking train carries us at a rapid speed. On both sides of us\r\nstretch apparently endless plains, thirty miles wide,--to the Coast\r\nRange on one side, to the Sierra Nevada on the other,--plains dry and\r\nyellow, parched in the brilliant sun, shaded by no clouds, but cooled by\r\na steady breeze from the northwest following us up the valley. Up, we\r\nsay, but it is hardly any more up than down, the ascent being about one\r\nfoot to the mile; it is rather a journey over one of the most level\r\nplains on the continent, but still the popular usage insists upon saying\r\n“up the valley.” Acres and acres of already harvested grainfields are\r\nseen on both sides, crossed by roads at right angles; here and there are\r\nstacks of grain which have not yet been threshed, or heaps of straw,\r\nwhere the threshing engine has done its work; on almost every section of\r\nland we see a farmhouse and barn, a few gum-trees or cottonwoods, and\r\nmany a windmill and elevated tank informs us where the farmer gets his\r\nwater for his house and his scanty trees. All this we see under a\r\nblazing sun and a quivering air.\r\n\r\nThis is the great San Joaquin valley, the fertile center of California.\r\nOf the much spoken of irrigation of California, we see almost nothing;\r\nthe land is dry and thirsty, the soil is loose, and the engine forces\r\nthe dust in a cloud before us. Nothing green is seen anywhere except a\r\nfew scattered trees far, far apart. Here and there we pass a little town\r\nwith wooden houses and dusty streets, with wooden churches whose spires\r\ndo not pierce the sky. We cross many streams, several of which are dry,\r\nor have sluggish waters, while some wind their way down the valley\r\nbetween banks covered with willows and cottonwoods. Yet there is\r\nsomething grand in this immense stretch of open, level country, with its\r\nframe of snowy mountains, with its fertile fields waiting for the\r\nwinter’s rain or irrigating ditch to produce abundantly of almost\r\nanything that can be grown in any temperate country in the world. The\r\nnumerous grain stacks speak of the fertility of the soil and of abundant\r\nharvests, while the vegetation along the rivers indicates that water is\r\nall that is needed to make this large valley like a fruitful garden.\r\n\r\nWe have passed Lathrop and Modesto and numerous smaller stations\r\nbetween; the picture is everywhere the same. At Atwater we met the first\r\nsigns of irrigation, and saw young vineyards and orchards on either\r\nside, and as we approach Merced we pass large irrigating ditches flowing\r\nwith water, and in the distance many houses and farms. The country is\r\ngetting greener, and the deep color of the soil is a sign that it is\r\nrich and fertile. At Merced there is a Yosemite air. The large El\r\nCapitan Hotel stands out like a landmark, and the garden with its\r\nflowers and shade trees, and the marble fountain with its rippling\r\nwaters, speak loudly of beauty and refinement.\r\n\r\nClose to Merced are situated some of the new promising colonies which\r\nare making raisin-growing one of their specialties, and in whatever\r\ndirection we look we see signs of such new enterprises, all young, of\r\ncourse, as irrigation has only lately been brought in here, where no\r\ndense settlements could exist without it. Much of the land is yet held\r\nin very large tracts, but they are being rapidly subdivided and sold out\r\nto actual settlers as fast as there is any demand for them. To our right\r\nlies a splendid body of perfectly level land occupied by the Yosemite\r\nColony with many settlers already on the land, whose new and cosy\r\ncottages mark their future homes.\r\n\r\nIn the distance, on the slope of the low hills, stand out prominently a\r\nnumber of houses, some of them quite pretentious, white and gleaming in\r\ntheir new dress. This is the Rotterdam Colony, a settlement of\r\nHollanders who have only lately arrived here. There is not a colony\r\nanywhere which promises to be more interesting, and which is likely to\r\nprove a greater success. The Dutch as a people had succeeded with\r\ncolonization long before any other nation began a similar work, and, as\r\nimmigrants to this State, they are most desirable. Industrious, saving,\r\nintelligent and persevering, with good land, plenty of water at all\r\ntimes of the year, and with a good location which insures health and\r\ncomfort, there is no reason why they should not succeed. The colony is\r\nmost beautifully situated on high sloping ground,--a veritable mesa land\r\noverlooking the vast Merced plains, and only four or five miles distant\r\nfrom the city. These Hollander colonists are the very best kind of\r\nsettlers the State can get,--not the ignorant peasantry of Europe, but\r\nintelligent and well-educated people, which any community can be proud\r\nof. There is great activity in the colony just now. Thousands of acres\r\nare covered with magnificent grain, which, without any more rain, would\r\ngive a profit of from twenty to twenty-five dollars per acre, and thus\r\nmaterially help to pay for the land. A hundred or more horses and mules\r\nwith their drivers are plowing and harrowing the soil; and such a\r\nplowing is not often seen anywhere. The plows are set about a foot deep,\r\nand the work is done by the canal company just to help the settlers\r\nalong and give them a good start. What more can they expect? Good\r\ntreatment is in Merced dealt out to everybody,--a good policy which\r\nshould be followed in every new colony in the land. We stop at the\r\nnewly-built house of Mr. Canne, a gentleman of middle age with a large\r\nfamily, and hearty and pleasing, as is so characteristic of the Dutch.\r\nHis house is large, very comfortable and airy, with large verandas\r\noverlooking the country far and wide. Inside everything is cosy and\r\nneat, with lots of mementoes from quaint old Holland, with colored china\r\non the walls and odd tables and odder bric-a-brac, family heirlooms from\r\ngenerations back. The old grandma, with her eighty-one years, has come\r\nalong with the younger folks, happy as they, and, as they, meeting\r\nbravely and with confidence new times and experiences in the new country\r\nwhich they have chosen as their home. Our wishes for good luck are not\r\nneeded; it is sure to come when such people are settled upon such land,\r\nand when everybody enjoys everybody else’s good-will. The land which is\r\nnow being broken is to be planted to olives, almonds, oranges, peaches\r\nand vines,--a very good selection indeed, and one which cannot fail to\r\nprove profitable. The deep red soil on the mesa will grow almost\r\nanything, and with proper care and management this colony must in the\r\nnear future become one of the most attractive and prosperous in the\r\nState.\r\n\r\nThe Rotterdam Colony is bounded on one side by the now famous and often\r\ndescribed Crocker and Huffman reservoir. Those who believe that a\r\nreservoir in the foothills is not the proper thing should come and take\r\na look at this one, and be convinced that it is. The location is a most\r\nfavorable one, being ninety feet above the town of Merced, and elevated\r\nsufficiently to irrigate the whole of the level surrounding district,\r\ncontaining two hundred and sixty thousand acres. The water covers now\r\nabout six hundred and forty acres which were formerly a real and natural\r\nvalley, across the mouth of which the dam checking the water was thrown.\r\nThe average depth of water is about thirty feet, while in some places it\r\nis fifty odd feet deep. The statistics of this reservoir and dam have\r\nbeen given often enough, but more or less correctly. The dam checking\r\nthe water is four thousand feet long, two hundred and seventy-five feet\r\nwide at the base, twenty feet on the top and sixty feet high in the\r\ncenter. It took four hundred mules and two hundred and fifty men two\r\nyears to build it. The reservoir and canal tapping Merced river cost\r\ntogether two million dollars to build, and the work was constructed in\r\nsuch a substantial and scientifically correct manner, that it will be\r\nlikely to last for ages. There is no other irrigation system in the\r\nState that is as well planned and carried out. This can and must be said\r\nto the honor of the constructors. The canal which taps the river is\r\ntwenty-seven miles long, from sixty to seventy feet wide on the bottom,\r\none hundred feet on the top, and has fall enough to carry four thousand\r\ncubic feet of water per second.\r\n\r\nWe have already remarked that the country between the dam and the city\r\nof Merced is a magnificent and level body of land, all eminently suited\r\nfor irrigation. From the water tower in the reservoir, we overlook all\r\nthis land, now in its spring dress a very beautiful sight indeed. The\r\nvast sheet of water, like a placid lake, in which the Sierra Nevada\r\nreflects its snowy peaks, the prairie extending far and wide, divided\r\nbetween luxuriant grainfields and unbroken lands now covered with their\r\nspring carpet of flowers in the colors of the rainbow,--yellow, white,\r\nblue, violet, red and shades of each, and dotted over with the new\r\nsettlers’ homes, freshly built and freshly painted,--what more lovely\r\nview could we wish, a sight of beauty and of plenty. As we drive back to\r\ntown, we are more than at first impressed with the lay of the land. The\r\nsurface is level and without hills or knolls, but is cut through by many\r\nnatural channels or creeks from fifteen to twenty feet deep, insuring a\r\nnatural drainage, invaluable in a country where irrigation is required.\r\n\r\nThe soil in this part of Merced county appears to be made up entirely of\r\nalluvial deposits from the various creeks which in winter irrigate the\r\nplains with their natural overflow. The largest of these creeks is Bear\r\ncreek, its deep channel resembling rather an irrigation ditch\r\nconstructed on the latest engineering principles than a natural stream.\r\nIts banks are even and slanting, while its bed is deep below the\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nBut our time to stay was short. We have left Merced and many smaller\r\ntowns behind us, crossed many more dry streams, and passed the large\r\nvineyards at Minturn, where sherry and port of excellent quality are\r\nmade. We have again crossed the main channel of the upper San Joaquin,\r\nnot far from where it emerges from the Sierra Nevada, its silvery waters\r\nwinding their way over the thirsty plains between steep and barren\r\nbanks. We have crossed a few irrigating ditches full to overflowing with\r\nwater, and see a few orchards and vineyards with their bright green\r\nscattered about on the yellow plains. There is suddenly a general stir\r\nin the cars, hats and bundles are taken down from the racks, most of the\r\npassengers prepare to move, the locomotive whistles, houses and trees\r\nare seen on both sides through the car windows, the train comes to a\r\nstandstill, there is a hum of voices, a waiting crowd swarms around the\r\ncars, a throng of people pushes in, and another throng pushes out. We\r\nare among the latter, as we are now in Fresno, the largest raisin center\r\non the continent.\r\n\r\nFresno, as seen from the railroad station, is not as inviting as it\r\nmight be, and the thousands of travelers who pass by on the cars, headed\r\nfarther south, can judge but little of the town and the district behind\r\nit. The country is so level, that the only way to get a good view of the\r\ncountry is to ascend some elevated building, the courthouse being the\r\nhighest, and through its location the best suited building for the\r\npurpose. The early forenoon, before the noonday sun has acquired its\r\nfull power, is the best time for this. Once up there, the view is\r\ndecidedly magnificent, and more extensive than we had ever expected\r\nwhile below. Under us lies a lovely park of trees,--umbrella, elm,\r\nlocust and fan palms, covering about four blocks. From it stretch the\r\nregular streets in all directions, lined by cottages as well as with\r\ncostly dwelling-houses, shaded with stately trees of various kinds. The\r\nbusiness portion of the town presents itself particularly well,--large\r\nand costly hotels, with comforts that the tired travelers enjoy so much,\r\nimposing bank blocks of brick and stone, with towers and ornamental\r\nroofs, solid structures with continuous lines of stores, etc., mark this\r\npart of town. For a mile in every direction the town stretches out, the\r\ncenter thickly built, the outskirts with sparsely scattered houses.\r\nAdjoining these the country begins,--vineyards as far as we can trace,\r\ngroups of houses shaded by trees in different tints of green, while\r\nbroken rows of endless poplars traverse the verdant plains and lose\r\nthemselves in the distant horizon. The Sierra Nevada, with their\r\nsnowclad summits, and the Coast Range in the west, cloudy and less\r\ndistinct, form the frame for two sides of this attractive picture, while\r\nto the north and the south the open horizon, where sky and plains meet,\r\nlimits the extensive view.\r\n\r\nThe street-car lines of Fresno do not run very far out in the country,\r\nand to see the latter we must procure a team. The colonies or\r\nsettlements of small farms immediately join the town limits; we are thus\r\nwith one step out in the country. On either side we see continuous rows\r\nof vineyards,--the leaves green and brilliant, the vines planted in\r\nsquares and pruned low, with the branches trailing on the ground. To\r\nbegin with, the houses stand closely, almost as in a village. As we get\r\nfarther out there is a house on every twenty-acre farm, or every\r\none-eighth of a mile. The cottages are neat and tasty, surrounded by\r\nshade trees, while rose-trees and shrubbery adorn the yard, and climbers\r\nshelter the verandas from the sun. At every step, almost, we pass teams\r\ngoing in various directions,--teams loaded with raisin boxes, teams with\r\nraisin trays, teams crowded with raisin pickers hurrying out to the\r\nvineyards, teams driven by raisin-growers or colonists generally, who\r\nrush to and from town to transact business connected with their one\r\ngreat industry. Everywhere is bustle and life; every one is in a hurry,\r\nas the grape-picking has begun, and the weather is favorable; no one has\r\nany time to lose. Some of the avenues are lined with elm-trees, others\r\nwith fig-trees, with their luscious, drooping fruit, others again are\r\nbordered with evergreen and towering gums, with weeping branches and\r\nsilvery bark. Every acre is carefully cultivated; there is room for only\r\na few weeds. As far as we drive the same scene is everywhere, a scene\r\nlike that in the outskirts of a populous city, where villas and pleasure\r\ngrounds alternate with the cultivated acres, here those of the\r\nraisin-grower, and where every foot of ground is guarded with zealous\r\ncare and made to produce to its utmost capacity. It is a pretty sight, a\r\nsight of thrift and intelligence, of enterprise and of success, of\r\nwealth and of refinement, found nowhere else outside of the\r\nfruit-growing and raisin-producing districts of California.\r\n\r\nThe raisin harvest has just begun; the vineyards are full of workers,\r\ngrape-pickers are stooping by every vine, and are arranging the grapes\r\non small square or oblong trays, large enough to be easily handled;\r\nteams with trucks are passing between the vines distributing the trays\r\nor piling them up in small, square stacks at every row. Some trays with\r\ntheir amber grapes lie flat on the ground in long continuous rows\r\nbetween the vines, others again are slightly raised so as to catch as\r\nmuch of the sun as possible. In some vineyards the laborers are turning\r\nthe partially cured and dried raisins by placing one tray on top of\r\nanother, and then turning them quickly over. In other places, again, the\r\ntrays with the raisins already cured are stacked in low piles, so as to\r\nexclude the sun and air, and at other stacks a couple of men at each\r\nare busy assorting the grapes, and placing the various grades in\r\ndifferent sweatboxes, large enough to hold one hundred pounds each. In\r\nevery vineyard, large and small, we find the hands at work, and every\r\none able and willing to do a day’s work is engaged to harvest the large\r\ncrop. The most of the pickers are Chinese, at least in the larger\r\nvineyards, while in the smaller vineyards, where large gangs of men are\r\nnot absolutely necessary, white men and boys are generally employed. The\r\nfame of the raisin section and the harvest has spread far and wide, and\r\nat picking time laborers gather from all parts of the State to take part\r\nin the work, and find remunerative wages at from $1.25 to $1.50 per day.\r\nThe country now swarms with pickers of all nationalities,--Germans,\r\nArmenians, Chinese, Americans, Scandinavians, etc., and as the schools\r\nhave closed in order to allow the children to take part in the work,\r\nboys of all sizes are frequently seen kneeling at the vines.\r\n\r\nThe crop this year is very heavy, many vines yielding two trays or even\r\nthree, containing twenty pounds each, and, as the trays are generally\r\nplaced in alternate rows between the vines, we see, as we pass,\r\ncontinuous lines of them filled with grapes in various stages of curing,\r\nfrom the green to the amber-colored and the dark of the fully-cured\r\nraisin. The aroma from the drying berries is noticeable, and the breeze\r\nis laden with the spicy and pronounced odor of the Muscatel raisins.\r\n\r\nThe average size of a colony lot is twenty acres. Many settlers own two\r\nor three lots, a few owning four or five. But it must not be understood\r\nthat the whole of these lots are planted to raisin grapes. While most of\r\nthe larger tracts are almost exclusively planted to raisin grapes, the\r\nsmaller farms of twenty acres contain as a rule only a few acres of\r\nvines, the balance being occupied by alfalfa, berries, garden, fruit\r\ntrees, and yard for houses and barns. From three to fifteen acres of\r\nraisin-vines are found on every twenty-acre farm; none is without its\r\npatch of raisin-vines. We step off and inspect many of the places, large\r\nas well as small. Magnificent vineyards are owned by T. C. White, one of\r\nthe oldest and most successful vineyardists, and by other parties, only\r\nsecond in importance to his. The vineyard of the late Miss Austin is yet\r\nin its prime, the evergreen trees and hedges being as inviting as in\r\ndays of old. New vineyards which have not yet come into bearing are seen\r\non every side, while in places whole orchards or single rows of trees\r\nhave yielded to the axe to be replaced by the better-paying\r\nraisin-vines.\r\n\r\nSome of the best-paying and largest vineyards are found east of Fresno\r\nCity. From the very outskirts of the city we pass through raisin\r\nvineyards, very few fields being planted with anything else. Near the\r\ntown some vineyards have given place to town lots, and whole villages\r\nare growing up in the old vineyards. We pass by the large vineyard of\r\nFrank Ball, containing about 120 acres, all in vines except a small\r\nreserve for house, barn and alfalfa field. Adjoining on the same road is\r\nthe Bretzner vineyard of forty odd acres, the vines loaded with grapes.\r\nWe turn to the left and, passing the vineyards of Merriam and Reed, see\r\non our left the magnificent Cory vineyard of eighty acres, bordered by\r\na wonderfully beautiful row of umbrella trees, with crowns as even as\r\nveritable gigantic umbrellas, and through the foliage of which not a ray\r\nof light can penetrate. A little farther on, also to the left, is the\r\nGordon vineyard, lined by fan palms and fig trees. A large sign across\r\nthe main road announces that we now enter the Butler vineyard, the\r\nlargest and most famous vineyard in the State, with its six hundred\r\nacres nearly all in vines,--the largest vineyard in one body and owned\r\nby one man in the world. Magnificent avenues of poplars, magnolias and\r\nfan palms stretch in various directions leading to the outbuildings, of\r\nwhich the packing and drying houses appear most prominently. Mr.\r\nButler’s home is one of the most attractive, shaded by umbrella trees\r\nand fantastic fan palms, and surrounded by flowers and evergreens. From\r\nhis vineyard alone over five hundred carloads of raisins have been\r\nshipped, the yearly product being over one hundred thousand boxes of\r\nraisins,--a thousand tons. The vineyard now swarms with laborers; the\r\nteams wait in long lines to load the ready raisin-boxes, while the\r\nspaces between the vines, as far as we can see, are almost covered with\r\ncontinuous rows of trays, all loaded with Muscat grapes in all stages of\r\ndrying.\r\n\r\nWe travel constantly eastward; on both sides are raisin vineyards, large\r\nand small. The four hundred acres owned by the Fresno Vineyard Company\r\nare devoted to wine grapes, and large wineries and cellars built of\r\nadobe show the wealth and extensive business of the place. No vacant\r\nland anywhere, nothing but vineyards, the only breaks being groves of\r\ntrees shading the homes, wine cellars or packing-houses of the\r\nproprietor. Farther to the north lies in an unbroken row the well-known\r\nEisen vineyard, where the first raisins were made in this district, but\r\nwhere now principally wine is produced; the Nevada and Temperance\r\nColonies, devoted mostly to raisins; the Pew, the Kennedy, the Forsyth,\r\nWoodworth’s, Duncan’s, Goodman’s and Backman’s raisin vineyards, all\r\nsplendidly cared for and lined by fig trees. Of these the Forsyth\r\nvineyard deserves more than a passing notice, as it is more inviting to\r\nan hour’s rest than any other. Containing 160 acres, nearly all in\r\nvines, it is one of the best properties of the county. The place shows\r\nan uncommon taste and refinement, and is beautified by avenues of\r\npoplars and magnolias, by groves of acacia and umbrella trees, by palms\r\nand flowers, and by roses and climbing plants. A pond with its lilies,\r\noverhung by weeping willows and shaded by stately elms, is an unusual\r\nsight even in this county of abundant irrigation. The packing-houses and\r\ndryer all display a taste and practical arrangement hardly seen\r\nelsewhere. A climb to the top of the tank-house is well worth the\r\ntrouble. The view becomes wonderfully enlarged; we overlook the level\r\nplains, all in vines, with houses and groves scattered about like\r\nislands in a sea,--no wild, unbroken country anywhere. In the distance\r\nis Fresno City, to the north the view is hemmed in by new vineyards and\r\ncolonies,--a mass of trees and vines in straight and regular rows. The\r\ncourteous owner conducts us through his packing-house and shows us how\r\nthe bunches are placed in layers and carefully made to fit every corner\r\nin the box, how the boxes are covered with papers and artistic labels\r\nand finally made ready for the market. As we pass out we get a glimpse\r\nof the equalizing room, crowded to the ceiling with sweatboxes, in which\r\nthe raisins assume an even and uniform moisture. And what luscious\r\nbunches they are, large, sweet, thin skinned and highly flavored. Malaga\r\nproduces nothing better, and much not as good. And, when we are all\r\nthrough tasting and admiring, we are invited into the cosy and\r\nartistically furnished dwelling, where in the cool shade the lunch and\r\nthe rest are as welcome and interesting as the vineyards and\r\npacking-houses outside.\r\n\r\nAs we turn again towards town, we pass the well-kept Goodman vineyard,\r\nafter which we enter the large Barton vineyard, now partly owned by an\r\nEnglish syndicate. The old 640 acres are nearly all in wine grapes,\r\nwhile several hundred acres of young raisin grapes have lately been\r\nadded. One of the most extensive wine cellars in the State is found\r\nhere, all kept in splendid shape,--hardly a speck of dirt, not a foot of\r\nwaste land seen anywhere. The mansion is stately, situated on a small\r\nhill surrounded by fine groves of gum-trees, evergreen hedges and\r\nornamental grounds. Should we care to go farther east, we might visit\r\nthe Eisen vineyard, where the first Muscats were planted in the county.\r\nThe famous avenue is half a mile long, and one of the most beautiful in\r\nthe State, lined on both sides with blooming and beautiful oleanders\r\nalternating with poplars over a hundred feet high. We might also visit\r\nthe Locan vineyard and orchard, and admire the orange-trees, which speak\r\nof what the country can produce in this line. But the time is too short;\r\nwe might travel a week over this level but beautiful country, and every\r\nday, every minute, see something new and interesting among all these\r\nvineyards, with their packing-houses, and raisins exposed on trays to\r\ndry.\r\n\r\nWhen we return to town, a visit to the packing-houses is one of the most\r\ninteresting that can be made. Of these packing establishments Fresno has\r\nfour or five, besides several in the colonies or in the larger\r\nvineyards. Three of these packing-houses are the largest in the State.\r\nThe building of each one of them, though large, is full and overcrowded.\r\nWomen at long tables pack the raisins in boxes, at other tables men\r\nweigh and assort raisins and take them out of the large sweatboxes in\r\nwhich they left the field. At some tables fancy packing is done, and\r\nwomen “face” the boxes by placing large selected raisins in rows on the\r\ntop layers. At another table the raisin-boxes are covered with fine\r\ncolored labels, then nailed and made ready for shipment. Some four\r\nhundred men and women are busy with this work under one roof, all\r\nearning wages of from one to two dollars a day each. We catch a glimpse\r\nof the equalizing room, where fifty tons of raisins are stored at one\r\ntime for a week or more in order to become of even moisture, the floor\r\nbeing sometimes sprinkled with water to make the air sufficiently moist.\r\nAs we go out we see the raisin-boxes already packed being loaded on cars\r\nand shipped east by the train-load, from four to six such raisin trains\r\nleaving every week, each train of from ten to twenty cars. On the other\r\nside of the packing-house is a continuous row of teams from the country,\r\nall loaded with raisins, brought by the country growers to the packers\r\nin town. It takes a gang of men to receive, weigh and unload them. In\r\nanother department we see the large stemmer and grader, which runs by\r\nsteam, and stems and assorts from thirty to forty tons per day, the\r\nclean and uniform raisins running out in a continuous stream, each grade\r\nin separate boxes. There is a restless activity on every side. The large\r\nraisin crop this year is very large; it must be handled in a few months,\r\nand every grower and packer is pushing the work to his utmost ability.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider that most of the crop, which this year will reach five\r\nhundred thousand boxes, comes from the country immediately surrounding\r\nFresno City, and that the San Joaquin valley is 250 miles long by 75\r\nmiles wide, almost all the land capable of being highly cultivated and\r\nof producing abundant crops of one thing or another, then alone can we\r\nrealize what the future has in store for this wonderful valley, an\r\nagricultural empire in the very center of California.\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM LOS ANGELES TO SANTA ANA.\r\n\r\nWe are fairly out of Los Angeles when the character of the scenery\r\nchanges. The railroad here runs through one of the most fertile counties\r\nin the State,--the rich bottom lands being formed by the deposits of\r\nages from the overflow of rivers and creeks from the Sierra Madre range.\r\nNot an acre of waste land is to be seen anywhere. Everything is clothed\r\nin the softest green, and only in the far distance are seen the hills\r\nand higher mountains of a brownish violet color, with the boldest\r\noutlines against the sky. A more diversified farming district is seldom\r\nseen. Orchards of prunes, walnuts, apples and figs are met with on\r\neither side of the track, here and there expansive vineyards with their\r\ncharacteristic green, or groves of straight and stately gums, like\r\nimmense square blocks of verdure, planted all along from the nearest\r\nfields to the far distant hills. We pass in succession Ballona,\r\nFlorence, Downey and Norwalk. The country around the two latter places\r\nseems especially attractive,--orchards as far as we can see, vineyards\r\nand native pastures. We pass villages and farmhouses, here and there a\r\nmore pretentious villa, and, in some spots more lovely than the\r\nsurrounding, many a mansion has been erected with luxury and taste.\r\n\r\nWe are soon in Orange county, and the scene changes some, the soil\r\nbeing, if possible, more fertile. We pass large orange groves of the\r\ndeepest green, and immense fields of corn, squashes, pumpkins, peanuts,\r\nbeans, and here and there walnut groves and plantations of young fig\r\ntrees. Anaheim, Orange and Santa Ana come in quick succession; we are in\r\nthe center of a raisin district of the very greatest interest. We can\r\nhardly realize the change. Not having been here since the boom,\r\neverything seems almost new. Santa Ana has grown to be the queen of the\r\nvalley, and is undoubtedly, together with its two sister cities, Orange\r\nand Tustin, one of the most prosperous as well as lovely places to be\r\nfound in the beautiful South. As we board the street car and ride up\r\ntown from the depot, we realize the change even more. On every side are\r\nsigns of wealth and refinement, of new ideas and new capital, both\r\nmostly imported from the East. Broad avenues one hundred feet wide, on\r\neither side, lined with trees of various kinds, cultivated fields\r\nimmediately beyond, which, with cottages, villas and churches, all speak\r\nof a prosperous and intelligent population.\r\n\r\nSanta Ana has her share of these stately structures. The Brunswick is as\r\nfine and substantial a building as any one could wish,--lofty and airy\r\nand of imposing architecture, large rooms and spacious halls. The boom\r\nthat has been so much misjudged has done much more than settle up the\r\ncountry and bring capital. It has left behind substantial improvements\r\nand a taste for architecture, the arts and sciences, which can but be of\r\npermanent value to the country. It brought the country at one bound from\r\nits former frontier life and characteristics to a high degree of\r\ncivilization and refinement. It brought capital, soil, climate and\r\nenergy together in a way that is hardly found anywhere else out of our\r\nState. The boom is over, but the benefits of the boom are yet here, and\r\nare permanent.\r\n\r\nSanta Ana, Orange and Tustin are like three precious stones in a ring of\r\nverdure. Only a few miles apart, they are like the villas on the\r\noutskirts of a central imaginary city, from which the wealthy and poor\r\nlikewise fled to a more retired country life, to enjoy both seclusion\r\nand society, both the pleasures of country life and the advantages of an\r\nactive city, where every luxury and necessity can be found at the door\r\nof every home.\r\n\r\nSanta Ana has a fine, large, central business street, with new and\r\ncostly brick blocks containing stores of every description. In this\r\nclimate, however, we can see no necessity for ice, and the manufacturer\r\nand mixer of cool drinks can but find his business unprofitable. Up and\r\ndown this street a line of cars runs all day long at fixed hours,\r\nconnecting with other lines in Tustin and Orange. A trip or two on any\r\nof the lines is one of real pleasure.\r\n\r\nTustin is only two or three miles away, nearer the hills. The car, an\r\nopen one with many seats, winds its way under shady lanes on either\r\nside, bordered by large and graceful pepper trees covered with spicy and\r\nfragrant blossoms. Here and there we see alongside the pavement an\r\nenormous sycamore tree, a monument of olden days and the native\r\nvegetation of the country. On both sides of the avenue are sidewalks of\r\ncement, and they who prefer walking can do so for miles under the shady\r\ntrees without getting dusty or becoming heated by the sun. These\r\nsidewalks are marvels of beauty and comfort. On one side are old and\r\ngraceful trees with drooping limbs, on the other are well-kept cypress\r\nhedges trimmed square and even, or long natural barriers of\r\never-blooming geraniums in numerous varieties, of every favorite shade\r\nof color from crimson to palest pink. Over the hedges we look into\r\nblue-grass lawns, green and well kept and exceedingly attractive.\r\nSuddenly we are in the middle of Tustin City. A beautiful, even\r\nmagnificent bank building on one corner, a store on the opposite, two or\r\nthree smaller shops and the inevitable splendid and elaborate hotel, and\r\nthe town is fully described. Immediately adjoining are the beautiful and\r\nevergreen lawns and trees,--the city and country actually combined.\r\n\r\nA trip to Orange reveals the very same features, only we pass through a\r\nmore fertile country, with vineyards and orchards on every side, orange\r\ngroves of various ages, walnut orchards, fields of tall corn, peanuts,\r\nbeans and melons. Between all wind the shaded avenues with pepper and\r\ngum, cypress, pine or yellow flowering grevillea. The soil is everywhere\r\nof the richest kind, of a color between ashy green and chocolate.\r\nNowhere have we seen such magnificent Indian corn,--whole fields where\r\nthe stalks are from twelve to sixteen feet high. Orange is a more\r\npretentious town than Tustin, but hardly any more beautiful, and far\r\nless secluded and quiet. There are two large and fine hotels, the one of\r\nbrick being in town, while the other, the family hotel, lies in the\r\nsuburbs in bowers of evergreen trees and gardens. In the middle of the\r\ntown there is a plaza with a fountain and an exquisite little garden\r\nwell planned and better kept. The lawns are like the softest velvet, and\r\nare bordered with blue and green flowers, with beds of sweetest\r\nmignonette, while bananas and palms spread their stately foliage in the\r\ncenter.\r\n\r\nThe climate of this part of Southern California is excellent. The\r\nthermometer stands at midday at eighty in the shade; in the evening\r\nthere is always a breeze. Many of those I meet complain as usual, and\r\ngreet me with the inevitable, “How warm it is to-day,” and our as\r\ninevitable answer is, that we cannot feel it, and that it just seems\r\ndelightful to us. People here observe and feel the changes of\r\ntemperature much more than we do farther north. With us they share the\r\nhabit of complaining even if there is nothing to complain of.\r\n\r\nThe vineyards of Santa Ana have suffered much from a vine disease which\r\nmay be compared with consumption or the Oriental plague in man. But\r\nevery one thinks here that the pest will run its course and become\r\nharmless, and even now some of the vineyards are being replanted with\r\nfresh vines. The oranges do eminently well, but they must be sprayed and\r\nconstant watch kept for the red scale imported here from Australia by an\r\nenterprising nurseryman. The plantations of walnuts are being rapidly\r\nextended, and nurseries of young walnut trees just appearing above the\r\nground are seen in many places, the plants probably amounting to\r\nmillions. The walnut generally planted is the seedling soft-shell and\r\nthe common Santa Ana walnut, than which there is none choicer and more\r\nvalued on the coast. Prunes are also a favorite crop, and pay well if\r\nnot allowed to overbear, in which case the succeeding crop will be\r\nsmall. The same may be said of the apricot. These trees are here fine\r\nand healthy, and of a deeper and finer green than is seen almost\r\nanywhere else; but last year the trees bore too much, and this year the\r\ncrop is by far not what it should be.\r\n\r\nThe resources of this country are such that the partial failure of a\r\nsingle crop will cause no serious injury. New resources are developed\r\nevery day; there are few plants that do not thrive here. In the gardens\r\nas well as in the fields we see the tender semi-tropical plants, which\r\ncannot stand any frost, growing close to varieties from the North.\r\nBananas, date palms, walnuts and oranges grow in the same field with\r\npeaches, apples and prunes. Pepper and camphor trees and the tender\r\ngrevillea are on one side of the avenue, while on the other side we may\r\nfind elm, eucalyptus or even the beautiful umbrella.\r\n\r\nIrrigation is practiced on every farm. Fifteen thousand acres are\r\ncovered by water stock, but not all irrigated yet. Just now the orange\r\ngroves are irrigated, and I observe their methods. The land is always\r\nleveled before anything is planted, as there is too little water here to\r\nwaste any on unlevel land. One way to irrigate an orchard is to plow\r\nfurrows in between the rows of trees, and then let the water run in\r\nthem. Another way is to check the whole orchard with small levees,\r\ninclosing thus a little square around every tree, and the square check\r\nof one tree meeting the same of the adjoining tree. This is actually\r\nflooding the land. Deciduous trees and vines grow without irrigation,\r\nbut to get a good crop irrigation is necessary. The large, dry and rocky\r\ncreek beds speak of the water that is wasted in winter time in flowing\r\nto the sea. Practically nothing of it is then saved. Irrigation\r\ndistricts under the Wright law are formed and forming, and everybody\r\nseems hopeful that in course of time there will be water enough to\r\nirrigate all the land that is good enough to be irrigated. Some of the\r\nfinest ranches in the State lie right at the feet of Santa Ana. The San\r\nJoaquin ranch contains one hundred thousand acres, I am told, and it is\r\nnot yet cut up, and thus some of the best land around Santa Ana is yet\r\nonly used as pasture. The owners failed to sell in the time of the boom\r\nand must now wait until the land that is already covered with ditches\r\nwill be fully settled before they can sell, but the time, we predict, is\r\nnot very far off.\r\n\r\n\r\nSANTA ANA TO SAN DIEGO.\r\n\r\nA railroad trip from Santa Ana to San Diego offers many points of\r\ninterest. It carries us through both the most highly cultivated and\r\nthrough the absolutely vacant, not to say barren, lands. We leave the\r\norange grove and walnut plantations of Santa Ana, and are carried almost\r\nimmediately past the lovely and shaded Tustin, where pepper groves and\r\nlime hedges, gardens and splendid villas, combine nature with art, taste\r\nand enterprise to create a veritable oasis for those favored ones who\r\ncan remain there. We rush for a few minutes through these highly\r\ncultivated lands, and suddenly find ourselves out on a wide, open plain,\r\ncomprising about eighty thousand acres, without a house to be seen\r\nanywhere, with no orchards, no vineyards, no signs of civilized life.\r\nAnd still the soil is the richest, the native vegetation of grasses the\r\nmost luxuriant. The soil is apparently subirrigated, and could grow\r\nalmost anything the farmer might plant there. Along the horizon,\r\nstretching from the mountains way down on the plains like an immense\r\nplumed serpent in its wavy and coiling track, is seen a continuous band\r\nof sycamore trees, outlining the bed of a stream. It is like stepping\r\nout of one room into another. What can be the reason of the sudden\r\nchange? This vast body of land, containing over 126,000 acres, is an old\r\nMexican grant, the remnant of one of those Mexican cancers, which to\r\nsuch an extent has retarded the development of California. Sure enough,\r\nwe see wire fences everywhere, and cattle with spreading horns and\r\nsheep without number. But we see no sign of the cultivator, no horses,\r\nno signs of progress. The owner held onto the land, probably expecting\r\nit to bring a price many times the sum it was worth. He died, and so\r\ndied the boom, and now the land is under administration. When the time\r\ncomes that this large San Joaquin grant can be sold to farmers in small\r\ntracts, it will very greatly increase the cultivable area of Orange\r\ncounty.\r\n\r\nBut we pass on, leaving the open country; we are soon in among the\r\nrolling lands, among foothills not unlike those of the Sierra Nevada in\r\nthe San Joaquin valley. To the left are the San Bernardino Mountains,\r\nhere and there a peak of boldest outline, and streams and cañons winding\r\ntheir way to the sea. At El Toro a number of passengers got off to take\r\nthe stage to Laguna, a seaside hotel, where the farmers and business men\r\nof every color, from the heated interior valleys, delight to spend a day\r\nin fishing, hunting for abalones, or in watching the breakers roll\r\nagainst the sandy beach. A little farther on we stop at El Capistrano,\r\nor rather at San Juan Capistrano, the old ruined mission, situated in\r\nthe most beautiful little valley, with its winding and sycamore shaded\r\ncreek. The mission must have been one of the very largest in the State.\r\nThe ruins are yet very extensive, consisting of long and regular adobe\r\nwalls, and one-half of a yet magnificent looking church, in the regular\r\nSpanish style of architecture. A rather large size town of Mexican\r\nhouses, with a Mexican population, and venerable fig trees, tall and\r\nwavy palm trees, and large but unkempt gardens, give the place a rather\r\nmore important look than it perhaps deserves. There is but little sign\r\nthat the boom was ever here. Still the valley is so beautiful and\r\nevidently so fertile, that it needs only work and taste to make it equal\r\nto the very best. We see yet the old mission pear trees, large and\r\nuntrimmed, not unlike our drooping oaks, loaded with pears to such an\r\nextent that there appears hardly room for a blackbird to get through.\r\nThe mission grapevines are all dead. Gigantic vines, which covered\r\ntrellises and arbors, and which perhaps bore tons of grapes, with trunks\r\nas heavy as the body of a boy, are there yet, but without leaves and\r\nyoung shoots; they are dead, having surrendered to the vine pest of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving Capistrano we follow the little creek to the sea. The\r\nvalley is from one-half to one mile wide. Here and there are flourishing\r\nlittle vineyards, but mostly pastures and cornfields or patches of\r\nbeans. At last we reach the sea, the Pacific, calm and blue, with\r\nbreakers lashing the shore. To the right we leave the rocky promontory\r\nof the Capistrano Mountains, and for an hour or more run on the very\r\nbeach. In stormy weather the spray of the breakers must wet the cars,\r\nwhich run only a stone’s throw from the water’s edge. This part of the\r\nroute is the most interesting and the most refreshing to one coming from\r\nthe interior plains. We are now in San Diego county. The shore is abrupt\r\nand bluffy, the hills bordering on the sea.\r\n\r\nAt Oceanside we meet the first of the boom towns, one of those that\r\nsprang up for pleasure and profit, towns of magnificent villas, broad\r\nstreets and avenues, lined with infant blue gums, with rows and hedges\r\nof the ever-bright geraniums, and with large and splendid-looking\r\nhotels, with airy balconies, verandas and lookout towers, swept by the\r\nfresh breezes of the sea. The vicinity of every such station is heralded\r\nby the characteristic white stakes that mark the town lots, and by rows\r\nof small, intensely blue, gums; by a sprinkling of cottages, small and\r\nlarge, perhaps a mile or two before the whistle of the steam-engine\r\nbrings us to a standstill. The first things that meet our eye at every\r\nstation are large and splendid lawns, young plantations of palm trees\r\nand other plants characteristic of the Southern coast climate, flowers\r\nof brightest hue, all started by the enterprising immigrants who came\r\nhere to buy climate, sun and air, and to enjoy the breakers and the\r\nocean every day in the year. After Oceanside, we touch at Carlsbad and\r\nDel Mar, both seaside resorts with magnificent villas costing from\r\ntwenty to forty thousand dollars each, and with fine but young\r\nplantations and gardens. I was especially charmed with Del Mar, with its\r\nlarge, tasteful hotel on the bluff, and quite a large colony of villas\r\nand mansions in various sizes and styles close around,--a bright and\r\ncharming picture, a place where a traveler feels at home at once, where\r\nhe would like to pass the balance of all the days he can spare from\r\nbusiness and toil.\r\n\r\nThe scene changes again as the cars carry us through the foothills,\r\nalong the bed of creeks, or across lagoons connected with the sea, or\r\nover gaping chasms. We look down deep into the valleys below, where\r\nshady sycamores and white cottages mark the farmers’ homes, and where\r\nvine-clad hills offset the native brown of the country. I am surprised\r\nto see how the grapevines thrive so luxuriantly so very close to the\r\nshore. In some places there are fine and thrifty vines within a stone’s\r\nthrow of the breakers, only protected by a slight undulation in the\r\nground from the most direct wind. Of course, grapes on those vines\r\ncannot be expected to be very sweet; it is wonderful enough that they\r\nare there at all.\r\n\r\nThe water supply of this part of San Diego county has been very much\r\nunderrated. The railroad crosses perhaps a dozen different creeks, all\r\nshowing living water, and which are far from being entirely dried up.\r\nWith a Supreme Court more enlightened, and with proper legislation as to\r\nthe needs of the country, San Diego county may yet be able to store\r\nwater enough to irrigate very large areas of land, where colonies of\r\nthrifty farmers may create and maintain prosperous orchards and\r\nvineyards as a support and backbone to the many pleasure resorts.\r\n\r\nBut we are out of the hills. Smiling and glistening in the evening sun\r\nlies San Diego Bay, with the elevated Point Loma, the ever-present\r\nbreakers on the bar, and away out on the low peninsula the gigantic and\r\nturreted pile of the Hotel del Coronado, to say nothing of San Diego\r\nitself, with its miles of marked town lots and villas. But I shall not\r\nendeavor to describe this town and its bay and climate. The latter may\r\npossibly not be excelled anywhere; the former lacks a most essential\r\nthing,--an abundance of trees and vegetation. Still, with the water that\r\nhas lately been brought here the trees and flowers will come soon enough\r\nwe hope, when green lawns, bananas and palms will be ready to tell the\r\ntale, and young plantations will be seen on the hills and around\r\nroadway homes. But I forget I am bound for El Cajon and its raisin\r\nvineyards, and must catch the train.\r\n\r\n\r\nEL CAJON.\r\n\r\nThe country lying between San Diego and El Cajon does not at this time\r\nof the year present many attractive features. The little train,\r\nconsisting of a locomotive, tender and a passenger car, wriggles itself\r\nbetween brown, rolling hills, over small cañons, dry and sandy, without\r\nany other vegetation than grass, and here and there a few evergreen\r\nshrubs. Close to San Diego we pass along the Chollas valley and creek,\r\nwhere an attempt has been made at colonization, as we understand it in\r\nthe San Joaquin valley. The land is divided up in ten and twenty-acre\r\ntracts and dotted over with small and unpretentious cottages, as well as\r\nwith fine and expensive mansions. Young orchards of pears, olives,\r\nprunes, oranges and figs are seen wedged in between vacant and unbroken\r\nland. In the river bottom are Chinese gardens, with windmills, and\r\npatches of cabbage, corn and small truck. Much of this land is irrigated\r\nwith water from the Sweetwater dam, some twelve miles away on the\r\nSweetwater river. On the bottom land there are a few Muscat vineyards,\r\nfor the supply of the San Diego market. I noticed the grapes there. They\r\nwere of the Muscat of Alexandria variety, very large and fine both as to\r\nbunch and berry, and very sweet. I have seen no finer Alexandrias\r\nanywhere.\r\n\r\nBut we have hardly time to observe this cultivated spot before we are\r\nout again among the rolling hills. The engine pants heavily, and we are\r\nconstantly ascending. The same low hills everywhere,--no settlers, no\r\ngardens, no plantations of any kind. The soil is brown adobe mixed with\r\ngravel and small boulders; in fact there is nothing to see and admire.\r\nFor twenty miles there are two or three small stations, but there were\r\nno station houses to be seen nor any settlements around. The railroad is\r\napparently made to tap a better country in the interior. But even in\r\nthis uninhabited country the boom started to penetrate in earnest. Large\r\nsigns announcing the sale of town lots, wide streets once plowed up\r\nacross each other at right angles, square blocks which are plowed around\r\nor otherwise mapped out, here and there a white post with a number and a\r\nname, and we have a good idea of a town where the lots sold for $250\r\napiece or more.\r\n\r\nAll at once the engine whistles, the area widens and we see in front of\r\nus a large, flat valley, apparently almost circular, from four to five\r\nmiles across, bounded by lower and higher hills, behind which a few\r\nhigher peaks look down gray and solemn. This is El Cajon. We step out on\r\nthe platform of the station, and the view is fine. The valley lies below\r\nus, the bottom is apparently flat, but in reality slightly undulating\r\nand somewhat sloping towards the center. Rows of vines begin at the\r\nstation, and from here vineyards stretch in all directions for miles and\r\nmiles, sometimes in large blocks of regular shape, then again in\r\nirregular patches among otherwise cultivated lands half way up on the\r\nlower hills. Dotted all over the valley are farmhouses in all styles,\r\nelegant and tasty or plain and simple, enough only to keep out the rain\r\nand the sun. Around every such cluster of buildings there is a little\r\nplantation of eucalyptus and cypress, and a few ornamental plants. Here\r\nand there at long intervals is seen a row of gums, black and somber, as\r\nif they were on duty as shields from wind and fog. We are soon in the\r\nbus on the way to town. The roads are straight and well kept, bordered\r\nwith young eucalyptus and cypress, and with vineyards on both sides with\r\nthe rows of vines remarkably distinct; we can follow each one of them\r\ndistinctly for several miles over the undulating ground until they end\r\non the steeper slopes of the hills, or run into the little cañons\r\nbordering the valley. El Cajon has no pretentions to being a town; it is\r\nan unassuming and quiet little village, whose inhabitants, when they\r\nspeak of “town,” always mean San Diego, twenty miles away. El Cajon has\r\na dozen houses, all told, one of each kind of the most necessary stores\r\nand shops, but Wells, Fargo & Co. have not yet discovered this quiet\r\nplace. Nevertheless, it has two hotels, one small and unassuming, which\r\nruns a bus to the station, and where everybody seems to meet; the other,\r\nlarge and pretentious, both as to bay-windows and name,--Corona del\r\nCajon, but apparently void of much internal life. The railroad to El\r\nCajon was finished only some eight months ago. If it had been running\r\nthree years ago during the Southern boom, the valley would perhaps\r\nto-day be rivaling Pasadena and Riverside in thrifty farms and\r\nresidences.\r\n\r\nEl Cajon is the most important raisin-producing district in San Diego\r\ncounty, and so exclusively and to such an extent have the raisin grapes\r\nbeen planted here that we hardly see anything else. Vineyards as far as\r\nwe can see in all directions; vineyards in the rolling bottom of the\r\nvalley; vineyards also on the steeper slopes of the hills; nothing else\r\nthan Muscats of Alexandria for business, and only a few other vines\r\naround the cottages for home use. A drive through the valley brings us\r\nin close contact with what we saw from the more elevated station. One\r\nvineyard joins the other, with only a road between, and there are no\r\nrows of poplars and only very rarely a row of eucalyptus or cypress. The\r\nview is open on every side, and from every point we can see over the\r\nvalley and the low hills surrounding it. The vines have at this time of\r\nthe year left off growing and have assumed a dark green color, not\r\nrelieved by any young and more vividly colored shoots. The grapes hang\r\nripe under the branches, and the trays are in many places distributed in\r\npiles over the field. There are two packing-houses in the valley; the\r\none now under way is 40 by 130 feet, being built of redwood, and\r\napparently most carefully put up. I see no sign of irrigation anywhere,\r\nand every one tells me that it is not required. But I cannot help\r\nthinking that a little water judiciously used would have kept the vines\r\ngrowing much longer, and would have naturally increased the crop, which\r\nnow only averages two and one-half tons of green grapes per acre. There\r\nare many very beautiful mansions in the valley, surrounded by very\r\npraiseworthy attempts at landscape gardening, but the absence of water\r\nfor irrigation makes itself felt everywhere, both in regard to the size\r\nof the plants and their color. Water can be had in abundance at a depth\r\nof from only twelve to eighteen feet, and windmills and reservoirs would\r\ndo much towards a substitute for ditches. As we drive through the valley\r\nand up the divide between El Cajon and the Sweetwater valley, the view\r\nis very attractive indeed,--on one side the many well-kept vineyards of\r\nEl Cajon, on the other, way below us, the narrow and winding valley of\r\nthe Sweetwater.\r\n\r\nThe Sweetwater valley, or rather continuation of valleys, is much\r\nsmaller than El Cajon, perhaps only a quarter or half mile wide, but it\r\nis more favorable to raisins, grapes or vegetation of any kind. Olive\r\norchards of good size trees, vineyards with large and yet growing vines,\r\ncornfields and pastures, and the winding and shaded little creek in the\r\ncenter of the valley, give the latter a freshness and beauty not\r\nsurpassed anywhere.\r\n\r\nOn our way on the railroad as well as through El Cajon valley, we have\r\nfrequently passed alongside of or under the now famous Cuyamaca flume,\r\ncarrying water to San Diego and Coronado. This flume is a fine\r\nstructure, running sometimes in the ground, sometimes again on elevated\r\ntrestle-work over the ravines, or spanning the gaps between lofty hills.\r\nThe whole length of the flume is thirty-six miles, and the cost of\r\nconstruction was $112,000. Its size is five feet, ten inches wide, and\r\nsixteen inches deep, but by an addition of two more boards the depth of\r\nthe water can be increased to three feet, ten inches,--a large body of\r\nwater for this country, where water is comparatively scarce. The flume\r\nheads in a magnificent dam at the head of San Diego river, and it would\r\nsuffice to irrigate quite a large stretch of country if the people were\r\nonly willing to use the water. But the farmers here have been so\r\nrepeatedly told that the land absolutely needs no irrigation, and indeed\r\nwould be ruined by the same, that the most of them now fully believe\r\nthis to be the case. The water is therefore not diverted anywhere along\r\nthe route of the flume, and even in El Cajon and other places, where the\r\ncrop of almost every kind of fruit would be doubled by judicious\r\nirrigation, no effort to use the same is made. I could find no one who\r\nirrigated, and as a consequence the company that owns the flume have not\r\nyet put in the extra boards that would more than double the carrying\r\ncapacity of the flume.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting places in San Diego county is the famous\r\nSweetwater dam. It takes only two and one-half hours to visit it and\r\nreturn, and a trip to it will repay the trouble. We start out southeast\r\nand cross to National City, only a few miles from San Diego, and really\r\na suburb of that town. National City is decidedly new, an attempt at\r\nsomething grand, which it will take sometime to finish. The most\r\ninteresting thing there, in a horticultural sense, is the olive orchards\r\nof Kimball Brothers. They are scattered in two or three places, and\r\ncomprise about fifty acres altogether. The trees are as large as good\r\nsize apple trees, bushy and silvery, and are heavily laden with fruit.\r\nThe land around each tree was checked up, each tree having a little\r\nsquare for itself, and a Chinaman with a hoe was busy irrigating. In\r\none corner of the orchard was a large circular reservoir five or six\r\nfeet high, and perhaps twenty feet across, to facilitate the irrigation.\r\nThe train starts from here directly in among the hills, following the\r\nbed of the Sweetwater river. The bottom land is now being settled up by\r\nfarmers and gardeners, who were busy taking their first lessons in\r\nirrigation. The plantations of course are very young, the irrigation\r\nworks having been finished quite recently. At Sunnyside there are a few\r\nolder orchards of oranges and olives, but, as a whole, the country is\r\nuncultivated.\r\n\r\nFive minutes more and we are at the dam. There is no station, except a\r\nlittle wooden platform, and we had to scramble over a rough hill to get\r\ndown to the dam. The gorge there is probably one hundred feet wide and\r\nseveral hundred feet deep, with almost perpendicular sides. There is no\r\nother vegetation visible than grass and a few low shrubs scattered\r\naround. It is a most excellent place for a dam. The Sweetwater dam is\r\nbuilt almost entirely of masonry and cement, and, both as regards\r\nconstruction and size, is one of the very best in the world. It is built\r\nin the shape of an arch, with the convex part up stream, and gives an\r\nimpression of solidity and safety not always found in structures of this\r\nkind. The masonry dam is forty-six feet wide at the bottom, at the top\r\ntwelve feet. The length of the top is 340 feet, and at the bottom of the\r\ncañon the base of the dam is about one hundred feet, while the height is\r\nabout ninety feet in the center. At one end of the dam is a wasteway and\r\ngates for letting the water out in case of a flood. The gates slide on\r\nan inclined plane, and consist simply of three-inch boards with pegs in\r\neach end, which are caught by a hook when they are to be raised. The\r\ncapacity of the wasteway is said to be fifteen hundred cubic feet per\r\nsecond, or as much as the Sweetwater river is ever likely to carry, even\r\nduring flood time. For one who is accustomed to headgates and waterways\r\nin the Fresno canals, this waterway looks very small indeed. But the\r\nengineers say it is large enough, and we suppose they must be right. The\r\nwater is delivered through a large iron pipe thirty-six inches in\r\ndiameter, covered for some distance down the cañon with masonry. For\r\n29,807 feet, this pipe line runs down the valley or on the mesa lands\r\nadjoining it. It will deliver fifty million gallons of water per day,\r\nand can now irrigate ten thousand acres of land. The whole cost of\r\nconstruction was $502,000, and the time consumed in building was two\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nThe reservoir, as it now stands, is a magnificent sheet of water with\r\ntributary watersheds of 186 square miles, and a water surface of about\r\nthree and one-half square miles. It is a grand illustration of the\r\nenterprise of the San Diego capitalists, of the skill and success of the\r\nCalifornia engineers, and of what may possibly be accomplished on nearly\r\nevery stream in San Diego county. It is a structure of which any country\r\nmight be proud, and which has few equals and no superiors anywhere in\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nOn our way back we meet a picnic party of schoolgirls, who with their\r\nteachers have spent the day in the country. They fill the cars with\r\nsmiles and chat, with flowers in bouquets and garlands, in baskets and\r\nby the armful. We are treated to flowers and to beautiful Muscat grapes\r\nculled from the vineyards,--enormous bunches and berries almost as large\r\nas plums. These grapes are a revelation to me, grown here within the\r\nreach of the fogs of the ocean, and irrigated with water from the dam or\r\nflume. Verily, I have never seen choicer grapes anywhere, and I am\r\nsatisfied that they could not be surpassed by any for raisins. What a\r\nfertile country this will be when irrigation is better understood and\r\nmore practiced. Could we but see it when that time comes.\r\n\r\n\r\nRIVERSIDE.\r\n\r\nThere is no place in Southern California where the effects of a close\r\nand intelligent study of horticultural matters are so visible as in\r\nRiverside. Money alone may build villas and mansions; but the\r\nintelligent and ever watchful horticulturist alone can, out of climate,\r\nsoil, water and capital, produce a Riverside. It is charming beyond\r\ndescription; it must be seen to be realized. The best time to get a full\r\nand good view of Riverside is early in the morning, just at sunrise, and\r\nthere is no better place to view it from than the hill on which the\r\nHotel Rubidoux was to have been built. I arose before sunrise, and\r\nstruggled up the steep hillside. It well repaid me for the trouble, as\r\nfew more beautiful views can be had. The whole settlement can be taken\r\nin at a glance,--the town close by imbedded in orange groves and\r\nvineyards, and the dense verdure of the country stretching for ten miles\r\ndown the valley, and almost connecting with the yet farther off South\r\nRiverside. On the eastern side we see the San Bernardino Mountains, with\r\nthe “Old Greyback,” and between the mountains and the settlements a\r\nlower range of steep hills appear, which in a continuous range either\r\nbar the way or like isolated islands shoot boldly up from the mesa land.\r\n\r\nThe Riverside colony forms a continuous settlement along the mesa,\r\nskirting the river, the deep green of the orange orchards harmonizing\r\nsplendidly with the lighter green of the vineyards. At close intervals\r\nthere are houses in every direction, with the bluest smoke rising\r\nstraight up from their chimneys, and thence carried in long, tiny bands\r\nand columns down the valley just level with the tree tops. It is a pity\r\nthe hotel on this hill was never finished--a great many more would then\r\nhave enjoyed the almost unequaled view. An extension of the main\r\nbusiness street in town leads up to this hill. On both sides of the\r\nstreet there are fine orange orchards and neat houses,--real country\r\nhomes, sidewalks of cement where rows of fan-palms take the place of\r\nregular shade trees along their sides. The business portion of Riverside\r\nis confined to two streets crossing each other at right angles. If we\r\nstand in the center of this crossing we take it all in, the houses\r\nextending a block and a half in the four different directions. Some of\r\nthe houses and brick blocks are very large and expensive, while many\r\nagain are smaller, but all are costly and elegant, with new and perhaps\r\nstartling ornamental designs. Whatever Southern California does, it does\r\nwell, and even the cheapest structures have an air of character and\r\ntaste which can hardly be too much admired.\r\n\r\nWhen one speaks of Riverside he means the whole settlement that is\r\nirrigated, and to live in Riverside may mean to live in town, or it may\r\nmean a suburban residence ten miles away. In the latter locality the\r\nbenefits of the country are happily combined with the luxuries of city\r\nlife. Street cars run from the center of the business part of town down\r\nto the end of the settlement. It is a cheap way to view the settlement\r\nto board one of these early cars. You can see as much as any one may\r\ncare to see, but of course cannot stop and examine. The whole drive is\r\none not to be matched anywhere else. From the moment you leave town you\r\npass orchards and vineyards separated from each other by only a road or\r\ncypress hedge. Every foot of ground is taken up. The main effort of all\r\nthe settlers appears to be to make everything attractive, from the very\r\nsidewalk to the elaborate garden and the villa. Nearer town, every\r\nstreet has sidewalks of cement, and bordering them are continuous hedges\r\nof cypress trimmed in various styles, and in front of every house are\r\nlawns and plats of shrubbery and flowers, as neatly kept as if visitors\r\nwere expected day or night. Some of the villas partake of the character\r\nof mansions, with towers, balconies and painted windows, while here and\r\nthere in some of the finest orchards are yet seen some of the first\r\nhouses built, small and unpretentious. The individual tastes of the\r\nowners are clearly discernible. One has a row of palms running along his\r\nsidewalk, another has palms and grevilleas, while others prefer the\r\npepper and gum. The manner of trimming the hedges is charming; it has\r\nhere become quite an art. Some hedges have square, others roofed tops,\r\nand at every corner there is a little pillar of cypress with diamond or\r\nglobular top, not at all artificial or stiff.\r\n\r\nThe vast majority of the plantations consist of orange groves. The color\r\nof the trees is splendid, every leaf being bright and shining, and there\r\nis no sign of smut or scale. The large and upright Seedlings are easily\r\ndistinguished from the smaller but bushy Navels. The tendency is now to\r\nplant mostly the latter, and most of the old Seedling trees are being\r\nbudded over. The original Navel tree, which is the prime cause of the\r\nprosperity of Riverside and of the fame of its oranges, is yet standing\r\nby a modest cottage, which appears not to have kept pace with the times.\r\nThe tree is small, perhaps twelve feet high, having been constantly cut\r\nback for buds. From this tree have sprung all the rest. No other Navel\r\ntree imported from Brazil or Australia resembles it in quality of fruit\r\nor in bearing capacity. It is probably a chance “sport” originally\r\nimported by the Agricultural Department at Washington, its companion\r\ntrees being different in the most essential points which make this\r\nvariety so valuable and so famous. This beautiful and choice orange, now\r\ngenerally known as the “Washington Navel,” is slightly oblong or\r\negg-shaped, and the skin is very smooth, with no ridges at the poles,\r\nthe latter being characteristic of the other Navel varieties. The crop\r\nof Navels this year is good. Many growers expect from three to four\r\nboxes to the tree, and, as each box brings from three to four dollars,\r\nit is evident the business pays. The valuable and permanent improvements\r\neverywhere show this to be the case; the account books of the grower\r\nneed not be searched to demonstrate it. Here and there we also see a\r\nlemon orchard with its larger trees of a different green. A few years\r\nago many lemon orchards were dug up, as no one understood the secret of\r\nsaving the lemons till the warm season, when alone they can bring a good\r\nprice. But at last one of the growers wrung the secret from Nature, and\r\nnow buys up all the young lemons he can find and stores them away to be\r\nused from six to ten months later, just when they are most in demand. In\r\ncompany with that courteous horticulturist, the editor of the Riverside\r\n_Press_, E. W. Holmes, we visited this gentleman, G. W. Garcelon. To him\r\nis due much credit for having discovered the process. He presented us\r\nwith lemons of the small and proper size that had been picked green\r\neight months ago. They were equal to the best imported, both as to\r\nsmallness of size, acidity, thinness of skin and quality of juice. These\r\nlemons bring now five dollars per box, at which price lemon culture\r\nproves more profitable than that of the orange.\r\n\r\nThe only variety that should be planted is the Lisbon lemon, the Eureka\r\nhaving too bitter a peel, and the much recommended Villa Franca being\r\nround and thus unacceptable. We passed several vineyards, the Muscat\r\nvines being large and the vineyards well kept. The grapes are just\r\nripening, but it will be some two weeks yet before they are ready to\r\ncut. The only variety grown here is the Muscat of Alexandria, the real\r\nGordo Blanco being unknown, or at least not generally planted.\r\n\r\nThe far-famed Magnolia avenue is near at hand. The center is occupied by\r\na continuous row of old pepper trees, with gracefully drooping branches,\r\nunder which the cars run. The outside rows are different in various\r\nplaces, generally palms with alternating grevilleas, or gum or pepper\r\ntrees. The custom now is to replace the outside trees with palms, and\r\nmany of the stately gums are being cut away. Beyond the sidewalks are\r\nthe trimmed cypress hedges, and behind them orange orchards, only\r\ninterrupted by open lawns and gardens partially hiding the tasty\r\ndwelling-houses of the horticulturists. All that we see, now so\r\nluxuriant and beautiful, is the effect of water on the otherwise barren\r\nplains. Everything is irrigated several times a year by means of flowing\r\nwater brought from distant points, from the mountain cañons, or from the\r\nartesian wells in the river bottom higher up, several miles away.\r\n\r\nThe canals are all on the highest ground, and are dug on technical\r\nprinciples. There is no washing and no filling up, no broken-down gates\r\nand overflowing and stagnant ponds. Some ditches are cemented, and look\r\nmagnificently clean, without any weeds or mud. The water in them is like\r\nthe water of a spring, clear and pellucid. In course of time all the\r\nditches will be cemented, the cost for doing the work being paid for in\r\na short time by the water saved and the absence of the necessary\r\ncleaning out.\r\n\r\nRiverside is indeed to be envied its Chinatown. The latter was, some\r\nyears ago, moved a mile from town into a hollow, and now every house\r\nthere is surrounded by cypress hedges and windbreaks of cypress and gum.\r\nMoreover, every house there is connected with the sewerage system, and\r\nthe usual smell is not noticed on the outside. Indeed, one can drive by\r\nand not know the nature of the town, for it looks like any other country\r\nvillage, almost hidden in evergreens.\r\n\r\nIn a few weeks the raisin harvest will commence, and from that time on\r\nRiverside, along its whole extent, will be life and bustle. When the\r\ngrapes are all in, the oranges will be ready for harvesting, and the\r\ncountry will again boast of its thousands of carloads of the golden\r\nfruit.\r\n\r\n\r\nREDLANDS.\r\n\r\nWe have reached the object of our journey in the upper end of the San\r\nBernardino valley. One of the features of South California, not Southern\r\nCalifornia, as we in the center all used to say, is the motor roads, not\r\nelectric motors, but regular little steam engines, that will pull you\r\nanywhere, and which will not shock you with anything except perhaps with\r\ntheir smoke. Such motor roads lead almost everywhere, connecting the\r\noutlying colonies way up in the mesa with the headquarters on the\r\nregular railroad. And these motor roads are neither neglected, nor do\r\nthey go begging for customers and freight. They are as much or more\r\npatronized even than the regular railroads, and they pay well. The cause\r\nof this is evident. They are more accommodating; they can without\r\ninconvenience stop wherever required, and passengers get on or off at\r\nalmost every corner. The little train stops with equal readiness at the\r\ncall in front of the rich man’s villa, to enable him and his family to\r\nembark, as at the poor man’s garden, to allow him to get on with a load\r\nof greens or with a basket of eggs. Thus managed, it rushes along with\r\nshort and frequent stops, always full of passengers and freight.\r\n\r\nGoing up the San Bernardino valley from Riverside is a trip that no one\r\nshould neglect. It takes us through one of the best improved parts of\r\nSouth California, through a veritable garden spot, with a radius of six\r\nor seven miles. From Riverside we pass for several miles over the level\r\nmesa land, just brought into cultivation through the new Gage canal\r\nsystem. Over two thousand acres have been planted here within the last\r\ntwo years to oranges, lemons and vines, and the fine and regularly\r\nplanted trees with the large distances between show us how much the new\r\nsettlers have been able to profit from the experience of the older ones.\r\nFor several miles there are young plantations, each with its neat and\r\nsubstantial residence and outhouses, indicating that the settlers mostly\r\nare people of some means and of much refinement and taste,--just the\r\nclass of people that we all would choose for our nearest neighbors.\r\nEverywhere are school-houses of artistic designs, most magnificent ones\r\nin the older settlements, smaller but tasty ones in those of almost\r\nyesterday. As we pass along the mesa, the upper San Bernardino valley,\r\nclosed in by steep and lofty mountains, lies on our right, and in front\r\nthe Santa Ana river courses through the center of the valley, with its\r\nvast broad river bottom covered with wild vegetation, pastures or\r\ncultivated fields. We cross several ditches, one laid in cement, with\r\nthe water running in them as clear as that in the washbowl.\r\n\r\nOnce across the river bottom we are almost directly at Colton on the\r\nSouthern Pacific Railroad. The first thing that attracts our attention\r\nis the beautiful plantation on the railroad reservation. Fine green\r\nlawns, fountains, beds of evergreens and flowers, the whole inclosed in\r\npepper trees, gives the traveler immediately the impression that\r\nsomething beautiful in the way of gardening can be accomplished, where\r\nthere is only a will and a taste. Such beautiful places everywhere in\r\nthe South show that the people who came here, came not alone to make\r\nmoney, but also to enjoy life and to cultivate those pleasures and\r\noccupations which help to prolong and beautify the same.\r\n\r\nFrom Colton up to San Bernardino the whole country is settled up and\r\nresembles the outskirts of a large city, where the business men have\r\ntheir suburban residences. The level and gradually sloping mesa is\r\ndotted over with little hills and knolls, just the place for a\r\nresidence. Every such place has been taken advantage of, and fine\r\nresidences with towers, balconies and airy awnings crown every little\r\neminence, each one through its peculiar situation seemingly dominating\r\nthe valley.\r\n\r\nSan Bernardino has been greatly benefited by the boom. The old and the\r\nnew are there in strong contrast, the new decidedly predominating.\r\nMagnificent brick blocks grace the principal business streets, and the\r\nnearest streets crossing them, blocks that must have cost large sums of\r\nmoney, and which for design and substantial structure can nowhere be\r\nsurpassed in any city of this size. The fine large hotels erected lately\r\nare kept up with style and even splendor. The large Stewart House is not\r\ninferior to the best town hotel that can be seen anywhere, and its\r\ninterior arrangements, with a large covered court, are most admirable.\r\nMy stay in San Bernardino was only too short; a long stroll around town\r\nand a little longer shake hands with the veteran journalist and\r\nhorticulturist, L. M. Holt, took all the time I had to spare.\r\n\r\nFrom San Bernardino to Redlands is but half an hour’s ride through the\r\nbottom lands of the Santa Ana river. We approach rapidly the upper end\r\nof the valley, where the elevated mesa spreads out all around like a\r\nperfect ampitheater, backed by the loftiest mountains in Southern\r\nCalifornia. The mesa is now in close view, and Redlands, Lugonia,\r\nTerracina, Crafton, all different points of the same settlement, lie in\r\nfront of us at an elevation of about fifteen hundred feet above the sea,\r\nlike a map or extensive panorama, where roads, orchards and houses are\r\nso clearly and distinctly seen that they can be observed at a glance.\r\nThe mesa land here slopes about four hundred feet to the mile, and the\r\ndifferent orchards or settlements lie apparently one above the other,\r\nall in full view. If I am asked for the place in this part of the\r\ncountry with the finest view, with the freshest air, with the purest\r\nwater, and with the coolest breezes, and where business and the comforts\r\nof life can be combined, I will say, and say it again, Redlands. In all\r\nthese points there is nothing here that surpasses it, and few are the\r\nplaces indeed that even can pretend to equal it. From whatever point we\r\nstand, be it at the lower end of the railroad depot, at any orchard or\r\nhome in the center of the settlement, or at the upper end close to the\r\nrolling hills, from every point we see every other point, some below,\r\nsome above us, all equally distinct. And this extensive and magnificent\r\nview, that requires no tedious and tiresome climbing to see, extends\r\naway down the valley for sixty miles, over slightly rolling hills, over\r\nlevel mesas with their dark-green orchards and vineyards, over the\r\nsteeper hills, over the lofty Sierra Madre range in the northwest. If we\r\nturn to the right we are immediately met by the snowy peaks and the bare\r\nwalls of the San Bernardino range, here and there cut by the cañons and\r\ngorges of the tributaries of the Santa Ana river.\r\n\r\nThe business part of Redlands is as neat and tasty as any,--brick blocks\r\nand cement sidewalks, horse cars, and water under pressure.\r\n\r\nNo explanation is required to be made of the quality of the Redlands\r\nclimate and soil. A trip over the settlement will reveal all to any one\r\nwith open eyes. Orange orchards, young of course, but thrifty, on every\r\nside, alternating with Muscat vineyards, according to the taste of the\r\nowner; beautiful homes of the horticulturists, the stately mansions of\r\nthe bank presidents and those that became wealthy quickly, and the grand\r\nview common to all,--these are some of the good things this settlement\r\nenjoys. The water for irrigation is all under pressure, either coming to\r\nthe surface in open flues or in iron pipes. The orange orchards are\r\nbeing irrigated everywhere, in a way which should make a San Joaquin\r\nvalley man stare. Iron pipes are laid all over the orchard, and at the\r\nbeginning of every row of trees there is a faucet. These faucets are all\r\nopened at the same time, and a tiny stream of water issues forth and\r\nruns on each side of the young orange trees down to the other end of the\r\ncheck. It is left to run for several days at a time. At the other end of\r\nthe check the water is not wasted, but runs into a little wooden spout\r\nat every row of trees and through the same into a cement ditch which\r\ncarries the water to another place. The system of irrigation is simply\r\nperfect; if it were not so, the land could not be irrigated. With this\r\nsystem there is no waste, no weeds, no malaria, no hoeing nor other work\r\nof any kind. Irrigation is here as easy as the washing of your hands in\r\na patent washstand: you open the faucet and let the water run. The\r\ngeneral opinion by people not acquainted with the colony is that water\r\nhere is very scarce; this is a mistake. There is water enough to\r\nirrigate all the land; most of it is now only running to waste to the\r\nsea; to be utilized it must only be stored. The Bear valley reservoir,\r\nwhen perfected, as it soon will be, will hold water enough to irrigate\r\nover twenty-six thousand acres of ground, which is about all the\r\nirrigable land tributary to Redlands. There are other reservoir sites in\r\nthe mountains, and the possibilities of future irrigation can hardly be\r\ncomprehended. Although young, only four years old, the upper San\r\nBernardino colonies produce already considerable quantities of fruit.\r\nSix thousand acres are now under cultivation, eight hundred of which are\r\nin Muscat grapes, the balance mostly in oranges and other fruits. Last\r\nyear they produced fifty carloads of grapes and forty carloads of\r\nraisins, and altogether about 149 carloads of fruit, dried or fresh. No\r\nbetter showing could be expected of any place, and there is no better\r\nadvertisement of the resources of the country.\r\n\r\nI have yet a thing to add, a thing to praise. Everywhere in the South\r\nmagnificent drives are laid out, avenues are planted with shade trees,\r\nevergreens and palms, street cars take you everywhere, and the comforts\r\nof pedestrians and riders are always assured. The roads are all\r\nsprinkled, and the dust is an unknown quantity except in by-lanes and\r\ncorners, where the sprinkler cannot reach. Riverside sprinkles the whole\r\nof her business streets, and her Magnolia avenue effectively and\r\ncontinually for about ten miles down the valley. Other places do the\r\nsame, perhaps only not to as liberal an extent. In many places the tired\r\npedestrian finds little wooden benches to rest on under a shady tree,\r\nclose to a fountain of drinking water, all placed there by the kind\r\nsociety, W. C. T. U. Comparisons are not in place; but how many times I\r\nhave wished such a thing had been met with in some other places I know\r\nof where the sun is just as hot, and where the dust is just as deep.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN HOUR IN A PACKING-HOUSE.\r\n\r\nThe following sketch of a Fresno packing-house, where already cured\r\nraisins are bought and packed, may prove interesting to those of my\r\nreaders who have not had time or opportunity to visit any similar\r\nestablishment. The same kind of work is going on in each packing-house,\r\nwhether it be large or small, except that the number of hands are\r\nvaried. In the two or three largest packing-houses in Fresno, as many as\r\nfour hundred hands are sometimes employed at one time when the work is\r\npressing; as it slackens, less hands are used. These large city\r\npacking-houses are all situated close to the railroad; they buy the\r\nraisins already cured and dried from the colonists, who bring them in\r\nsweatboxes to town. The time of the greatest activity is from the last\r\nweek in August to October 15th. The largest of these city packers are\r\nMessrs. Cook & Langley, who own packing-houses both in Riverside and\r\nFresno; Schacht, Lemcke & Steiner, successors to George W. Meade, the\r\noldest packing-house in Fresno, superintended by H. W. Shram; Chas.\r\nLeslie & Co., Griffin & Skelley, etc.\r\n\r\nThe pioneer packing company of Fresno, known as the Fresno Raisin &\r\nFruit Packing Company, is doing at this time a large business. Every day\r\nfive or six carloads of raisins are sent away, while a string of from\r\ntwenty to thirty, two and four horse teams are waiting outside of the\r\nweighing shed to have their raisins weighed and received. These raisins\r\ncome both from large and small vineyards from all over the country, but\r\nprincipally from the colonies, where they are the products of\r\ntwenty-acre vineyards. Some of the best raisins in fact came from the\r\nsmallest vineyards, where they had the best care, and where the owner\r\nhas given the vineyard all his time. Mr. H. W. Shram, the superintendent\r\nof this large and old packing-house, has had years of experience in the\r\npacking business, and has followed the Fresno raisin business from its\r\ninfancy. As soon as the raisin boxes are unloaded they are immediately\r\nweighed. It takes eight men to attend to this part of the business, one\r\nweighing and one clerk to keep accounts. The dried wine grapes, such as\r\nZinfandel, Malagas, and even Sultanas, are immediately wheeled into the\r\nstemmer-house to be separated from the stems and cleaned. This stemmer\r\nis one of the largest in the State, and the only one of its kind as\r\nregards construction. It stems, cleans and assorts, in from three to\r\nfour different grades, sixty tons of raisins a day. Nine men are\r\nworking this machine, some feeding, others pushing wide but shallow\r\nboxes under the spouts, others again wheeling them away when full. The\r\nsteam engine of ten horse-power and boiler are fired principally with\r\nseparated stems, refuse raisins, and stones of peaches and apricots. The\r\nseparated dried grapes are packed and shipped in eighty-pound sacks, and\r\ngo in this way to the East, or even to Europe. Every day one or two\r\ncarloads of these dried grapes are shipped. The Muscatel layers,\r\nhowever, go first to the sweating-room, before anything is done with\r\nthem. This sweating-room is one hundred by fifty feet, and has the walls\r\nand floor filled around with one foot in thickness of sawdust, so as to\r\nprevent the outside air from entering. This sweating room is constantly\r\nfilled with raisin boxes from floor to ceiling, and seldom contains less\r\nthan forty tons of raisins at one time. It takes from ten to thirty days\r\nto equalize the moisture in the raisins as well as to properly soften\r\nthe stems so that the grapes will not fall off. This is of the utmost\r\nimportance. If it is not done the stems will break and the berries fall\r\noff, and instead of a first-class layer raisin we would only get a\r\nfirst-class loose.\r\n\r\nAfter having sweated for several weeks the raisins are brought out to be\r\nassorted. We see several rows of oblong tables, each one with a border\r\naround like a deep and large tray, and with a hole at each end in which\r\nthe loose raisins are pushed. It takes eighteen of these tables to\r\nreceive the grapes to be assorted, and as it also takes six girls at\r\neach table, it is evident the work is one of great importance. Only\r\ngirls are used, as boys and men could not as properly do the work. It\r\ntakes a girl’s nimble fingers to handle the raisins, so that none break.\r\nThey are also more patient, and are, in every way, suited for the work.\r\nAs the raisins are being assorted, the different grades are clipped from\r\nthe same bunches, and placed in different trays. Thus one and the same\r\nbunch may contain four different grades of raisins. Each one is\r\nseparated at these tables, to make different brands of raisins. The\r\ntrays, with five pounds of raisins each as they leave the graders, are\r\nplaced in large piles on the floor, and are from there taken away at\r\nleisure, first to be packed and afterwards to the press. This is a\r\ndepartment of its own. It takes great experience to press the raisins\r\njust so much, that they will look well, but not so much as to burst. A\r\nbroken raisin will sugar and spoil, and would cause complaint and\r\ndissatisfaction. The public is constantly being educated as to what fine\r\nraisins are, and now wants only the best. Each tray is pressed, and it\r\ntakes four trays to make up a box of twenty pounds. A tray is placed\r\nover the box, the sliding bottom is pulled out, and the whole cake of\r\nraisins with paper and all drop in the box below.\r\n\r\nAfter the raisins are assorted they have to be packed. Twenty girls are\r\noccupied with this, the most pleasant, but also the most skillful, work\r\nin the packing-house. No bad raisins go in here, and if any there should\r\nbe, they are separated and placed with a lower grade, as even one or two\r\nraisins would spoil an otherwise good box. This requires a great deal of\r\ncare and attention, but the girls are being educated, and the same ones\r\nare re-engaged from year to year. Fresno is getting an army of girls\r\neducated for the business, and we find much less trouble now to get the\r\nraisins well packed than a few years ago, when everything was\r\ncomparatively new. Now there is hardly a girl in any of the colonies who\r\ndoes not know something about raisin-packing, and who is able to make\r\ngood wages during packing time. Several cents a tray are paid for\r\npacking, and many girls earn two dollars a day, while none earn less\r\nthan one dollar a day. The first quality raisins are packed under the\r\nLion Brand, while the second quality goes by the name of the Golden\r\nGate. Both brands are equally popular and are readily sold. The loose\r\nraisins are as important as the bunches and layers. The American\r\nhousewife has learned that she gets more for her money if she buys loose\r\nraisins than if she buys layers, which always contain a large percentage\r\nof stems. Loose raisins are therefore now very popular. The loose\r\nraisins have all been sweated, and the best of them have come from\r\nlarge, fine bunches, from which they have simply dropped off, and\r\nmagnificent they look indeed as they are separated and graded into\r\nseveral grades, the largest of course to make the very choicest brands.\r\nThe process of packing is quite different from that of packing layers.\r\nIn loose, the boxes are simply filled with fifteen pounds of loose\r\nraisins; then a tray containing five pounds, and which has been faced,\r\nis placed on top, this making up twenty-pound boxes.\r\n\r\nThe facing is a most important and interesting work. It takes from forty\r\nto fifty girls to do it, and only expert hands are allowed at the facing\r\ntables. The facing consists in placing large, fine and flatted raisins\r\nin layers on top of the box, as an advertisement that the contents\r\nunderneath are equally carefully assorted and choice. A careful and\r\nskillful facer can face forty boxes a day, while from twenty to thirty\r\nboxes is a low average. Mr. Shram buys raisins and dried grapes from\r\nevery one who has any that are really choice. For Feherzagos three to\r\nthree and one-half cents are paid, for Malagas four cents, and for\r\nMuscatels three and one-half to five cents, according to quality. All\r\nthe work in the packing-house is done by piece work, and from two to\r\nfive cents are paid for different qualities of the work, such as\r\nassorting, picking over, picking and facing. Four hundred girls and boys\r\nare daily employed. The present raisin pack, Mr. Shram affirms, is the\r\nbest of any he has ever handled. They are shipped to every large town in\r\nthe East, and are constantly increasing in demand. Besides raisins, Mr.\r\nShram handles peaches, figs, apricots, and in fact any dried fruit we\r\nhave. Tons and tons of Adriatic figs are brought from the colonies every\r\nday at six cents per pound, an enormous price when we consider the yield\r\nof a fig tree. But, says Mr. Shram, they are in demand, and as long as\r\nwe can sell them again when packed and sweated to advantage we can\r\nafford to pay a good price.\r\n\r\nWhen sufficient boxes are packed, they are loaded in cars and made up\r\ninto trains exclusively loaded with raisins. The various packing-houses\r\ncombine to do this. Generally during the packing season two such\r\ntrain-loads are sent away every week, each one consisting of from ten to\r\nfifteen cars of raisins, each car containing one thousand boxes. Five\r\nhundred and thirty such cars were shipped from Fresno last year (1889).\r\nSome of the packers packed one hundred thousand boxes each.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRAISIN GROWERS AND THEIR VINEYARDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following sketches are intended to convey to those not living in the\r\nraisin districts of our State an idea of the men who have made a\r\nspecialty of the raisin industry,--men through whose experiences and\r\nintelligent work others are now profiting.\r\n\r\nWhile the raisin growers and packers can now be counted by the hundred,\r\nand while all of them have in some way contributed to the development of\r\nthe industry, and as such deserve to be mentioned in the annals of this\r\nindustry, it has only been practicable to here refer to a few of the\r\nmost prominent. Where exactly to draw the line was not easy to decide,\r\nand my intention has been not to slight or neglect any one, and should\r\nany one find himself omitted he should account for it through my\r\nignorance of real facts. I should especially have wished to add to these\r\nshort notes more extensive accounts of the work and vineyards of R. B.\r\nBlowers of Woodland, of the late G. G. Briggs of Davisville, and of\r\nRobert McPherson of McPherson, but I have not been able to procure the\r\nnecessary data. These three gentlemen have all greatly contributed to\r\nthe development of the high standing of the raisin industry in this\r\nState.\r\n\r\n\r\nG. G. BRIGGS.\r\n\r\nMr. Briggs was the first large raisin-grower in the State, and owned\r\nvineyards in both Solano and Yolo counties aggregating seven hundred\r\nacres or more. Subirrigation by means of perforated pipes, in which the\r\nwater was made to circulate under pressure, was first tried extensively\r\nin Mr. Briggs’ vineyard at Davisville, by which means the grape crop was\r\nalmost doubled. Later on Mr. Briggs planted extensively in the\r\nWashington Colony at Fresno, but he died before his vineyard there came\r\ninto bearing. He is said to have imported raisin grapes direct from\r\nSpain, and a grape now growing in the vineyard of G. E. Freeman at\r\nFresno is said to be of that variety. It resembles the Muscat of\r\nAlexandria in growth, but the berries are those of the Gordo Blanco. Mr.\r\nBriggs advised to give the raisin-vines more room, and following his\r\nideas several vineyards as well as his own were planted with the vines\r\nten by sixteen feet.\r\n\r\n\r\nR. B. BLOWERS.\r\n\r\nR. B. Blowers of Woodland, Yolo county, planted his first vines in 1863,\r\nand produced his first raisins in 1867. From 1870 to 1873 he planted the\r\nprincipal part of his vineyard. He was the first one in California to do\r\nany really careful packing, and he may justly be said to be the father\r\nof the raisin industry in this State. Mr. Blowers was the first to\r\nirrigate the raisin-vines by means of pumping and flooding, for which\r\npurpose he constructed his afterwards so famous well. The first\r\nsuccessful raisin dryer was invented and built by him at a time when\r\nevery one else doubted the propriety and desirability of drying grapes\r\nby artificial heat, and the dryer thus constructed has never yet been\r\nsurpassed. One of the characteristics of the Blowers dryer was the\r\nblower or suction fan, by which means the air was changed in the dryer,\r\nthe moist air being sucked out, while dry air was allowed to rush in.\r\nMr. Blowers improved nearly every branch of the raisin industry, and\r\nstudied every operation, such as plowing, irrigation, curing and\r\npacking, more thoroughly than any one ever did before or has done after\r\nhim. Mr. Blowers’ raisins were the best in the State at their time, and\r\nwherever exhibited received the first premium. At the World’s Fair at\r\nPhiladelphia, they received the first premium, and attracted much\r\nattention. I may add that Mr. Blowers is the inventor or at least the\r\nperfector of the “face-down” method of packing, the best method for\r\npacking raisins. Mr. Blowers has published a short essay on raisins,\r\nreferred to elsewhere in this book.\r\n\r\n\r\nROBERT McPHERSON.\r\n\r\nRobert McPherson was for Southern California what G. G. Briggs and R. B.\r\nBlowers were for the Northern part. The McPherson vineyard extended once\r\nover 360 acres of land, and one year he shipped over one hundred\r\nthousand boxes. Many of the practical devices for irrigating, curing and\r\npacking raisins now generally in use in the southern part of the State\r\nwere invented by him. The McPherson vineyard was situated in Orange\r\ncounty in the southern part of this State. Robert McPherson was\r\ncertainly the largest and most prominent raisin-grower in Southern\r\nCalifornia. He is now no longer in the business.\r\n\r\n\r\nT. C. WHITE.\r\n\r\nThe “Raisina” vineyard was the first thoroughly conducted raisin\r\nvineyard in Fresno. It was planted by T. C. White in 1876, ’77 and ’78,\r\nand from that time gradually extended until it contained one hundred and\r\ntwenty acres, of which sixty-five acres are in Muscatel grapes of the\r\nvariety known as Gordo Blanco, brought there from the Blowers vineyard\r\nat Woodland. The vineyard also contains some Seedless Sultanas and White\r\nCorinths. The soil of the vineyard is white ash, the location two miles\r\nsouth of Fresno, in the old Central California Colony. The soil is now\r\npartly subirrigated. T. C. White has done a great deal to develop and\r\nperfect the packing and curing of raisins, and he has also given much\r\ntime and study to the other branches of the industry, such as growing,\r\npruning and cultivation. Through the study of the imported Spanish\r\nraisins, as well as of those produced by R. B. Blowers, Mr. White\r\nsucceeded in packing a very superior brand, which has never been\r\nsurpassed in this State. The brands packed at the Raisina vineyard were\r\nas follows: Dehesa Clusters, London Layers, California Layers, Loose\r\nMuscatels, and cartoons of two and one-half pounds. The largest pack at\r\none time was thirteen thousand boxes of twenty pounds each. In order to\r\n“face” the boxes accurately and rapidly, T. C. White invented the\r\nfacing-plate elsewhere described in this book. Experiencing considerable\r\ndifficulty in properly facing his Dehesas, it occurred to him that a\r\nblock or plate might be made with cavities in which the raisins could be\r\nplaced quickly and without danger of being disturbed. His idea was\r\nentirely original, and the facing device as made by him is a perfect\r\nmachine which has not been improved upon. This device is now covered by\r\npatents.\r\n\r\nIn packing T. C. White employed the Blowers’ method, or the “face-down”\r\nmethod, which he so improved upon that it has not since been excelled.\r\nMany of the fine points in raisin curing and packing were perfected by\r\nhim, and the raisin industry will always be benefited by the work he has\r\ndone. Below I give a list of the premiums taken by T. C. White’s raisins\r\nat various fairs: 1885, silver medal and special first premium for best\r\nraisins at the Mechanics’ Fair in San Francisco; 1886, first premium and\r\ngold medal at the Mechanics’ Fair in San Francisco; 1888, first premium\r\nand one hundred dollars for best raisins at the State Fair. Same year\r\nthey received first premium and gold medal at the Fresno District Fair;\r\n1889, first premium at the Fresno District Fair.\r\n\r\n\r\nMISS M. F. AUSTIN.\r\n\r\nThe story of Miss M. F. Austin and her success with the Hedge Row\r\nVineyard reads like a beautiful tale. A schoolteacher by occupation,\r\nMiss Austin possessed many prominent qualities and elevated ideas, among\r\nothers that horticulture should become a business for women as well as\r\nfor men. Acting upon these ideas, Miss Austin removed to Fresno in 1878\r\nin company with a lady friend and teacher, Miss L. H. Hatch, and she\r\nbegan immediately to improve her Hedge Row Vineyard, a part of which had\r\nbeen planted two years before by Bernhard Marks, the founder of the\r\nCentral California Colony. The vineyard was gradually extended until it\r\ncontained one hundred acres, nearly all in Gordo Blanco vines. Miss\r\nAustin must be given credit for having improved upon many operations in\r\nthe vineyard and in the packing-house. She first discovered that under\r\nproper conditions the sulphuring should be done in the flowers of the\r\ngrapevines. By this method she one year largely increased her crop of\r\ngrapes. In packing she showed her womanly taste and refinement, and not\r\nonly succeeded in producing superior Layer and Dehesa raisins, but made\r\nseveral innovations in packing which to this day are imitated. Among\r\nthese we may mention the packing in cartoons, and in small ornamented\r\npaper bags, which latter were again placed in paper boxes. Miss Austin\r\nand T. C. White were the originators of fancy packing in this State.\r\n\r\nThe largest pack of the Hedge Row Vineyard was seventy-five hundred\r\nboxes, while the total of one year’s pack reached sixteen thousand\r\nboxes. Miss Austin built the first raisin dryer in Fresno, and\r\ndemonstrated that machine-dried raisins were a success if not a\r\nnecessity as regards the last crop. The pluck and intelligence of Miss\r\nAustin soon became extensively known, and many were the ladies who,\r\nimitating her, engaged in horticulture and in the raisin industry.\r\nFresno county and the State at large owe her a debt of gratitude for\r\nwhat she has done. Those who had the pleasure and honor of her\r\nfriendship lost in her a dear and faithful friend, a brilliant and\r\nintelligent companion, and a person who had few equals in any path of\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOSEPH T. GOODMAN.\r\n\r\nThe owner of the Floreal vineyard arrived in Fresno in 1879, and\r\npurchased a then already started plantation, which, however, he soon\r\ngreatly remodeled, enlarged and improved. Mr. Goodman, formerly one of\r\nthe brilliant newspaper men and literary writers of this coast, and\r\npublisher of the _Territorial Enterprise_ of Virginia City, Nevada, has\r\nprobably more than any other man studied the characteristics and\r\nrequirements of the raisin grapes. His vineyard, while not the largest,\r\nis in our opinion the best cared for in the State, and newcomers could\r\nperhaps not do better than learn from it. It now comprises one hundred\r\nand twenty acres, mostly in Gordo Blanco. For the curing of the grapes,\r\nthirty thousand trays or more are needed, while a separate packing-house\r\nand tray-shed are prominent features of the vineyard. The land was all\r\nleveled with great care before planting, and every check can be flooded\r\nif necessary. The soil is the very richest, being the chocolate-colored\r\nloam, which in Fresno is considered the best and strongest soil for\r\nMuscat grapes. The location of the vineyard is the old sink of Red Bank\r\ncreek, in the same district where Forsyth’s and Butler’s vineyards are\r\nsituated. As regards planting, pruning, sulphuring, topping and other\r\nvineyard operations, Mr. J. T. Goodman is an authority from whose\r\nverdict there is no appeal. The Floreal vineyard always bears good\r\ncrops, which must be exclusively attributed to the care given the\r\nvineyard and to the judgment with which all operations there are\r\nconducted. Mr. Goodman has invented several appliances for facilitating\r\nthe vineyard work, most prominent among which I may mention the vineyard\r\ntruck, by the means of which the expenses of harvesting and some other\r\nvineyard labors are greatly reduced. He also suggested the facing-plate\r\nindependently of T. C. White.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. B. BUTLER.\r\n\r\nThe largest raisin vineyard in Fresno county or in the State of\r\nCalifornia, as well as in the world, is owned by A. B. Butler. The\r\nvineyard is situated about three miles southeast of Fresno, on the sink\r\nof Red Bank. It contains about six hundred acres, nearly all of which is\r\nplanted in Muscat grapes of the Gordo Blanco and Alexandria varieties,\r\nand a few Sultanas. The vines are planted at various distances, such as\r\nten by sixteen feet, and six by twelve feet, etc. The pruning is all\r\n“low standard,” except the Sultanas, which are staked four feet high.\r\nThe only trees in the vineyard consist of two or three avenues of fig\r\nand poplar interspersed with fan palms, while some poplar trees line the\r\noutside boundaries of the vineyard. The first vines were set in 1879,\r\nand since that time the planting has been carried on until the whole six\r\nhundred acres are now in vines in full bearing. Mr. Butler himself\r\nsuperintends the general work of the vineyard, and during the packing\r\ntime carefully watches the packing. The latter is accomplished in a\r\nlarge building containing packing-rooms, storerooms, steam dryer,\r\nseparator, box factory and storeroom for labels. The dryer has a\r\ncapacity of fifty tons charge of green fruit, and is considered one of\r\nthe best in the State. There are two dryers, the large one just\r\nmentioned and one smaller, of twenty-five tons capacity, situated in the\r\ncenter of the vineyard. The Butler raisins are celebrated all over the\r\ncontinent, and are most excellently packed. The labels used are very\r\nfine and are manufactured to order in France. The principal brand packed\r\nis “Butler’s Cluster Raisins.”\r\n\r\nMr. Butler acquired much experience in Spain, where he spent\r\nconsiderable time studying the raisin business. The output of the\r\nvineyard has been as high as one hundred thousand boxes per year.\r\nSimilar to the other vineyards in this district, the soil of the Butler\r\nvineyard is among the very best in the county, all now subirrigated. Mr.\r\nButler is the largest packer in the State, and his raisins have gained a\r\ncontinental reputation. As regards Spanish methods of packing, Mr.\r\nButler is better posted than any other packer in the State. An\r\ninteresting essay on Mr. Butler’s experiences in California and in Spain\r\nis published in monthly _California_ for March, 1890. The crop this year\r\npromises to be of extra quality.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM FORSYTH.\r\n\r\nThe owner of the Forsyth vineyard and the producer of one of the two\r\nfinest brands of raisins in this State arrived in Fresno in 1881, and\r\nplanted his present vineyard of one hundred and sixty acres in 1882 and\r\n1883. The vineyard is situated in the sink of Red Bank creek, some four\r\nmiles east of Fresno, and consists of heavy reddish or chocolate-colored\r\nsoil of unusual richness. The vines used are almost entirely the Gordo\r\nBlanco variety, with a few Sultanas. The land is all leveled, was\r\nirrigated the first year only, and is now subirrigated and drained,\r\nrequiring no further irrigation of any kind. The vines, set eight by\r\neight feet, are pruned low, and given short spurs. The outbuildings\r\nconsist of a packing-house, and equalizing or sweating house combined,\r\nthirty-five by one hundred and seventy feet. A dryer of late pattern,\r\nwith steam boilers and flues, has a capacity of forty tons at a charge.\r\nThe houses for the laboring men as well as the Colonel’s dwelling-house\r\nare most elegant and complete, and show the care and refined taste of\r\nthe owner. Over fifty thousand trays for drying the raisins are used in\r\ncuring, the trays being three feet square, large enough to hold thirty\r\npounds of grapes. The grove of palms, ornamental and shade trees, the\r\nflowers and shrubbery surrounding the Colonel’s home in the center of\r\nthe vineyard, are all models of beauty and testify to the culture and\r\nprosperity of one of our foremost raisin-growers.\r\n\r\nThe vineyard produces yearly from fifty to sixty thousand boxes of\r\ntwenty pounds each, of the highest quality of raisins. The raisins are\r\nremarkable for their high grade and even packing. The brands are:\r\nForsyth’s Imperial Clusters, the “Tiger” brand and the “Forget-me-not”\r\nbrand. During the packing and picking season some two hundred and fifty\r\nhands are employed daily in the various departments, all under the\r\ndirect supervision of Colonel Forsyth himself, who has gained his\r\nexperience both by practical work in California and by visits to the\r\nraisin districts of Spain. During the latter he has gained much\r\nexperience about foreign methods, which he has not been slow to apply in\r\nhis own business. As regards location, the Forsyth vineyard is not\r\nsurpassed by any, and as regards appointments it is the most complete\r\nand handsome establishment that can be found anywhere. The Forsyth\r\nraisins excel in quality of berry, grade, uniformity of size and in the\r\nelegance and care with which they are packed. They stand at the head of\r\nthe California raisin product. Col. Forsyth has been appointed\r\nCommissioner for California at the World Fair in Chicago, 1892.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. D. BARLING.\r\n\r\nAmong our younger raisin-growers and packers, Mr. A. D. Barling occupies\r\na prominent place. A sketch of his life and connection with the raisin\r\nindustry is most interesting. He came to the raisin district with only a\r\ndollar in his pocket. To-day he is a wealthy grower and packer, whose\r\nraisin brand is among the best in the State.\r\n\r\nMr. Barling, formerly of Michigan, was educated at Ann Arbor. In 1873 he\r\nleft college and started West, settling in Merced county, California.\r\nThere he became connected with the Farmers’ Canal Co., as their chief\r\nengineer, which position he held for seven years, and in that capacity\r\nconducted the water of the Merced river down to Livingston on the S. P.\r\nR. R. From Merced he went to Mexico in the employ of the Mexican Central\r\nRailroad, but returned to San Francisco, California, in 1882. Here he\r\nhad charge of the construction of the large wharf at Alameda point, then\r\nbeing constructed by the S. P. R. R. Co.\r\n\r\nBecoming tired of working for a salary, Mr. Barling went to Fresno and\r\nrented a lot in the Central Colony. By dint of hard work, not having any\r\ncapital at all to start with, he and his wife saved one thousand\r\ndollars, with which they purchased the present El Modelo vineyard,\r\npaying forty-five dollars per acre for the rough land in 1885. Mr.\r\nBarling and his wife went to work with a will and set out the land in\r\nMuscat cuttings, but through unfortunate and unforeseen circumstances\r\nall the first planting was lost. Undaunted they replanted in 1886 with\r\ngreat success, and to-day they own one of the finest and best-paying\r\n150-acre vineyards in the county, having yearly added new territory to\r\nthe first purchase. Last season they packed sixteen thousand boxes of\r\nMuscat raisins, and established the El Modelo brand, which in the market\r\nis considered second to none, and which has established an enviable\r\nreputation for its packers. This year’s pack is estimated to reach fifty\r\nthousand boxes of twenty pounds each. Mr. Barling’s thorough education\r\nand skill and experience as an engineer has materially contributed to\r\nhis success. He has also held the position of assistant cashier in the\r\nFresno Loan & Savings Bank for the last five years.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANK H. BALL.\r\n\r\nThe Ball Vineyard adjoins the town of Fresno, and is situated in the\r\nrich red lands, the sink of old creeks. The one hundred and twenty acres\r\nin Muscatels are among the best cared for in the district. Mr. Ball\r\npossesses the faculty of doing the necessary work at the right time and\r\ndoing it thoroughly. The crop is annually sold in the sweatboxes to\r\npackers in Fresno City, no raisins being packed on the vineyard. Mr.\r\nBall is the author of an excellent essay on raisin-grape growing and\r\ncuring, published in the _California_ for July, 1890. His methods of\r\nculture and curing are the best, and the raisins produced by them are\r\nnot surpassed by any in the State. Mr. Ball is one of our most\r\nsuccessful raisin-men.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAN JOAQUIN VALLEY RAISIN PACKERS, 1889.\r\n\r\n  ===============+=========+==============+==============+==============\r\n       NAME.     |LOCATION.|    BRANDS.   | LOCAL AGENTS |EASTERN AGENTS\r\n                 |         |              |AND ADDRESSES.|AND ADDRESSES.\r\n  ---------------+---------+--------------+--------------+--------------\r\n  American Raisin|Fresno.  |Eagle, Star.  |Noble Bros.,  |Delafield,\r\n  Co.            |         |              |Fresno.       |McGovern &\r\n                 |         |              |              |Co., Chicago.\r\n                 |         |              |              |\r\n  Barling, A.

The various cyclopedias\r\ncontain articles on raisins, but they are all more or less confused and\r\nunreliable, and of no great use to any one who wishes only reliable\r\ninformation, and who must depend upon the same for practical purposes.\r\nAs regards California, much information has been given about raisin\r\ngrowing and curing in almost every newspaper published in the State. To\r\nmention them all would be to enumerate all the papers of the Pacific\r\nCoast. I can here refer only to a few of the principal ones, where the\r\nstudent who has time and inclination to follow up the subject may find\r\nmaterial for a more detailed history of the raisin industry than the one\r\nI have written.\r\n\r\nFirst among these papers I must mention the _Pacific Rural Press_,\r\nedited by that distinguished horticulturist, Professor E. J. Wickson,\r\nand published by Messrs. Dewey & Co. of San Francisco. In the files of\r\nthis weekly, from 1873 to the present time, 1890, may be found scattered\r\nmany interesting articles referring to our subject. A paper\r\ncontemporaneous with it was the San Francisco _Merchant_, which\r\ncontained many interesting articles on raisins and raisin grapes,\r\nespecially during the period from 1881 to 1887. In the issues of the\r\n_Press and Horticulturist_ of Riverside, San Bernardino county,\r\nCalifornia, we find during a series of years occasional notes and\r\narticles referring to the raisin industry of that section of the\r\ncountry. As regards the Santa Ana and Orange county district, the\r\nAnaheim _Gazette_ will prove the most reliable guide, as recording the\r\nrise and decline, and, as we believe, also the revival, of the raisin\r\nindustry of that section. The Yolo _Democrat_ and the Woodland _Mail_\r\npublished at Woodland, Yolo county, have devoted much space to the\r\nraisin industry of that section. In Fresno county the Fresno\r\n_Republican_, between the years 1882 and 1887, contained weekly a\r\nseparate department for viticulture and horticulture edited by the\r\nauthor of this book, and that paper has ever afterwards devoted much\r\nspace to recording the progress of the raisin industry of the country.\r\nThe Fresno _Expositor_, the oldest paper in Fresno county, has contained\r\nmuch information about raisin grapes and vineyards since 1873, when the\r\nfirst raisin-vines were planted in the county. During the period from\r\n1888 to 1890, this paper contained almost daily editorials upon the\r\nraisin industry, mostly contributed by this author.\r\n\r\nThe California _Fruit Grower_, a weekly horticultural paper mentioned\r\nbelow, has since its beginning a few years ago made dried fruit its\r\nspecialty, and has contained many important articles on our industry,\r\nand in its columns may be found the most reliable raisin statistics\r\npublished in this State. The San Francisco _Examiner_ contained in 1888\r\na series of articles on raisins, contributed by this author. The San\r\nFrancisco _Chronicle_ has from time to time given much space to the\r\nraisin industry, and its horticultural editor, George F. Weeks, has most\r\nably contributed to the dissemination of knowledge about our California\r\nraisins. A special raisin edition of this paper appeared February 2,\r\n1890. Another San Francisco paper, the _Journal of Commerce_, contains\r\nmuch information as regards raisin statistics and the progress of the\r\nraisin industry generally, and its files may be consulted with much\r\ninterest and profit. Among Eastern journals I wish only to call\r\nattention to the _Fruit Trade Journal_ published at New York up to date\r\n(June, 1890); it contains weekly statistics of raisin sales, etc., all\r\nof great interest to the grower and packer. An important contribution to\r\nthe history of the raisin industry is the work by Professor E. J.\r\nWickson,--“California Fruits, and How to Grow Them.” It contains several\r\nchapters on grapes, most conscientiously written and very reliable. This\r\nbook will always remain as a standard work of reference upon the\r\nsubject. Professor E. W. Hilgard has during a number of years published\r\nessays upon topics related to our industry, all most valuable to the\r\npractical grower. They are enumerated below.\r\n\r\nI may also mention the _Rural Californian_, published in Los Angeles. It\r\ndevotes from time to time some space to the raisin industry of the\r\nsouthern part of the State. In the Reports of the State Board of\r\nHorticultural Commissioners will be found several papers upon the raisin\r\nindustry, all mentioned below. Similarly the Reports of the State Board\r\nof Viticultural Commissioners contain several important and very\r\ninteresting essays on raisins, etc., which are duly mentioned below. In\r\nthese reports we find articles by T. C. White and W. B. West and others,\r\nas well as interesting discussions by growers. The _California_, a\r\njournal of rural industry, which commenced publication this year (1890),\r\nand is issued weekly and monthly, makes the raisin industry a specialty.\r\nIt has already contained many articles contributed by our most\r\nsuccessful growers, such as A. D. Barling, T. C. White, A. B. Butler,\r\nFrank Ball, Wm. Forsyth, etc., and also by this author. In the way of\r\nillustrations, California is fortunate to possess a most exquisite work\r\non grapes. We refer to the very fine colored prints of California grape\r\nvarieties published by Edward Bosqui. Among the number are our Muscat of\r\nAlexandria and Seedless Sultana. Each one of these plates is a work of\r\nart, than which there is nothing superior produced anywhere.\r\n\r\nBelow follows an enumeration of books, which to a greater or less degree\r\nrefer to the raisin industry. For access to many of them I am indebted\r\nto the kindness of the proprietor of the Sutro Library, Mr. Adolph\r\nSutro, of San Francisco, and to his librarian, Mr. George Moss.\r\n\r\n  ANSTED, D.

The second crop, however, is\r\nlarge and very good, and altogether the yield is a satisfactory one. The\r\nprices have ruled higher than before and raisins in sweatboxes have been\r\ncontracted for readily at from 5½ to 6½ cents per pound or even higher.\r\nWine grapes dried here sold for 3 to 4 cents per pound, and Malaga and\r\nFeherszagos raisins have brought from 4 to 5 cents. No such prosperous\r\nyear has before been experienced by the raisin men of this State, and\r\nreports come in that many growers are realizing from $250 to $450 per\r\nacre from vines in full bearing.\r\n\r\nThe weather all through the summer has been unusually temperate and thus\r\nvery favorable to the full development of the grapes, and so far the\r\ndrying weather has been very favorable for the proper curing of the\r\nraisins. Many new packing houses have been established, and the crop is\r\nbeing better cared for than in previous years. The health and general\r\ncondition of the vines is better than it was last year and the vine\r\nplague is less virulent, and according to some reports even on the\r\nretrograde. The demand for the raisin product has never been as large as\r\nnow and there will apparently be no surplus left over, as the demand is\r\nrapidly increasing. The above refers especially to the central part of\r\nthe State, to Merced, Fresno, Tulare and Kern counties, where the\r\nprosperous season will encourage increased planting. In Southern\r\nCalifornia the crop will be fair both in quality and quantity. In El\r\nCajon valley it is reported as very good, and as being one-half larger\r\nthan last year. Prices here ruled to begin with at from 4½ to 5 cents\r\nbut rose rapidly to 5½ and 6 cents in sweatboxes.\r\n\r\nThe duty on raisins has this fall been raised from 2 cents to 2½ cents\r\nper pound, which insures an additional profit to the raisin men.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rain-fall of 1889-90._--The rain-fall of 1889-90 in the Central and\r\nNorthern raisin districts of California was as follows:\r\n\r\n  ======+====+====+====+====+====+====+====+====+======\r\n        |Oct.|Nov.|Dec.|Jan.|Feb.|Mar.|Apr.|May.|Total.\r\n  ------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+------\r\n  Fresno|3.10|1.43|3.80|2.16| .65| .92| .29| .25|12.60\r\n  Tulare|4.17| .43|2.60|2.75| .74| .81| .22| .20|11.92\r\n  Kern  |2.04| .22|1.75|1.20| .16| .24|    | .06| 5.67\r\n  Yolo  |8.14|3.04|9.62|6.36|3.69|3.35|1.60|2.21|37.41\r\n  Yuba  |5.87|3.73|9.01|4.44|4.65|6.71|1.85|2.55|38.81\r\n  ======+====+====+====+====+====+====+====+====+======\r\n\r\nThe above figures are from the “tables of rainfall in the principal\r\nagricultural counties” of California, compiled and published by Albert\r\nMontpelier, Esq., Manager of the Grangers’ Bank, San Francisco, but no\r\nreport is made of the rain-fall in the counties of San Bernardino and\r\nSan Diego, and statistics of those counties are not at hand.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_Duty on Raisins._--The revised tariff of 1890 makes the duty on\r\nimported raisins 2½ cents per pound, an increase of ½ cent on the old\r\nschedule.

Merced, from\r\n  its fine fountains, is now known as “The Fountain City.” It is the\r\n  county seat of Merced County. The Southern Pacific Railroad, a\r\n  transcontinental line, passes through this place, from San Francisco\r\n  to New York. The Oakdale Line from the north also starts from Merced\r\n  City, giving direct communication by rail with Sacramento Valley,\r\n  Oregon, Washington, and all points north. Merced City is the nearest\r\n  point in the San Joaquin Valley to the great Yosemite Park, and\r\n  commands the only passable railroad route to this “World’s Greatest\r\n  Wonder.” Merced City also lies in a direct line from Yosemite, through\r\n  Pacheco Pass, in the Coast Range, to Del Monte, on the Bay of\r\n  Monterey. These great natural advantages are now being developed on a\r\n  scale commensurate with nature’s own great gifts. The largest and most\r\n  costly irrigating canal in the United States has been completed, and\r\n  is now discharging the crystal snow waters, fresh from the Yosemite\r\n  Falls, into Lake Yosemite, one mile from this colony. Thus we find\r\n  ourselves in the possession of a combination of nature and art, which\r\n  present advantages in climate, health, water privileges, wealth of\r\n  soil and their productions which are not as fully possessed by any\r\n  other locality in California. And, as an enduring crown to our\r\n  prosperity, we point to the late Act of Congress of the United States\r\n  in setting apart the Yosemite Park, with her giant Sequoia and\r\n  sugar-pine forests, insuring and perpetuating the annual snow and rain\r\n  on the watershed of our canal system. The Yosemite Colony contains\r\n  about 5,000 acres, and is beautifully situated by the side of Lake\r\n  Yosemite, and bounded on the north by the fine Colony of Rotterdam.\r\n  “The Yosemite” was the first colony subdivided and placed on the\r\n  market after the perfection of our irrigating system, two years ago;\r\n  and a large main ditch was then brought by the proprietor from Lake\r\n  Yosemite to and through these lands. Young Orange Groves, Almonds,\r\n  Prunes and Apricots, Figs, Pomegranates, Peaches, etc., etc., have\r\n  already been planted; also several fine young Raisin Vineyards, of\r\n  only two years’ growth, which this autumn produced raisins of the most\r\n  superior quality. The soil is from four to twelve feet in depth, with\r\n  under strata of heavy, rich clay, which will always insure an\r\n  abundance of moisture, when with proper irrigation. These lands are\r\n  all free from alkali, and about one-half of them situated on the rich,\r\n  alluvial plain; the other half are gently rolling, and extend into the\r\n  red gravelly soils, so much prized for Olives, Oranges, Lemons, Wine\r\n  Grapes and Strawberries, while the lower levels are especially prized\r\n  for the famous Muscat Raisin Grape, as well as for the Prune, Almond,\r\n  Pear, Apricot, Alfalfa and Vegetables. Merced City, situated one\r\n  hundred and fifty miles from San Francisco by rail,--one hundred miles\r\n  from the coast,--in the center of the San Joaquin Valley, is also the\r\n  exact geographical center of the State--north, south, east and west.\r\n\r\n  We are not offering you land that has not been thoroughly tested to\r\n  produce what we advertise. Neither are we offering you hog wallows,\r\n  salt grass and alkali flats; but we offer you a block out of one of\r\n  the richest fields of California. As to health, we challenge the whole\r\n  world to surpass us. Our locality is free from malaria; and fogs in\r\n  summer and autumn are unknown in this dry and equable climate. Not\r\n  only is our locality free from fog, and fanned by the gentle\r\n  invigorating sea-breezes from the south and southwest, but we are\r\n  protected from the harsh, desiccating northwest winds, offering a\r\n  retreat to the weak and ailing; and its rich and attractive location\r\n  contributes greatly to its charms.\r\n\r\n  For scenic beauty it has but few, if any, superiors in California.\r\n  Standing at the lake, or on any other elevated point on the Colony, a\r\n  most inspiring panorama is presented to the eye. The vision reaches\r\n  one hundred and fifty miles south and east, and takes in the ever\r\n  snow-capped Sierra Nevada; thence south and southwest we follow the\r\n  long blue line of the Coast Range to the Mt. Diablo, one hundred and\r\n  thirty miles to the northwest, in the vicinity of San Francisco.\r\n  Looking to the north and east, you see looming up the grand Sierra\r\n  Nevada, with its mantles of perpetual snow, seemingly so near in the\r\n  pure air that, although it is one hundred miles to the summit,\r\n  strangers are almost tempted to quit the green colony fields and visit\r\n  them as an afternoon stroll.\r\n\r\n  A fine school-house has been erected on the Colony, at a cost of\r\n  $5,000, and is now in good working order. Trees of one and two years’\r\n  growth border most of the avenues, including Palms, Locust, Olive,\r\n  Magnolia, Eucalyptus, Mulberry, etc., etc.\r\n\r\n  Under our irrigation system the owner of the land purchases water from\r\n  the Canal Company which is filed in the County Recorder’s books, and\r\n  is then inseparable from the land, and is always conveyed as a part of\r\n  the realty.\r\n\r\n  We now offer you this land, together with perpetual water-right, at\r\n  from $150 to $200 per acre, according to quality and location. No land\r\n  will be deeded to any persons except actual settlers. As inducements\r\n  to families, we will plow and prepare the land ready for planting, as\r\n  our aim is to settle these lands with families. Payments may be made\r\n  in installments to suit purchasers. We make the following liberal\r\n  offer to those who do not feel able to pay cash for the land: The\r\n  purchaser is to build and occupy a neat and substantial cottage; also\r\n  build all needed outhouses, paint or whitewash the same, and plant the\r\n  land to such trees and fruits as may be agreed to be the best. This\r\n  done the first payment will be deferred for five years, one-quarter to\r\n  be paid annually thereafter. Said sum agreed to be paid to bear eight\r\n  per cent interest per annum from date of sale. Deed will be given\r\n  purchaser when he builds and plants, and the purchase price secured by\r\n  mortgage on the premises. A family with from $1,500 to $2,000 to make\r\n  their improvements can settle down and safely wait until their fruits\r\n  or raisin vineyard come into bearing. The whole purchase price should\r\n  be produced from the lands the fifth year.\r\n\r\n  For those who have not experience, or are desirous of avoiding the\r\n  expense of team and tools, we will plant, cultivate, irrigate and care\r\n  for their orchard and vineyard until it comes into bearing. It will be\r\n  worth about $25 per acre to furnish and plant the first year, and $10\r\n  to $15 per acre each year thereafter. The above figures mean\r\n  compensation for good, first-class work.\r\n\r\n  We have already some fine planted tracts for sale, embracing Raisin\r\n  Vineyards, that will come into bearing next year (1891), also young\r\n  Orange Groves, as well as deciduous Fruit Orchards. We also aim to\r\n  keep a vacant cottage on the Colony, for the accommodation of each\r\n  newcomer until such time as he can build on a lot of his own choice.\r\n  Deciduous Fruit Trees can be planted commencing January 1st, and as\r\n  late as the 1st of April. Orange Trees in March and April. Grape\r\n  vines, rooted or cuttings, should be planted in February or March.\r\n  Peaches and Apricots will bear light crops the third year. Pears,\r\n  Almonds, Figs and Oranges will begin to bear the fourth year. Raisins\r\n  begin to bear, from the cuttings, in the third year. One year’s time\r\n  is gained by planting rooted vines. It is safe to expect $50 per acre\r\n  the third year from rooted vines, and $100 per acre the fourth year,\r\n  at least, gross product. A respectable cottage should be built, with\r\n  from four to five rooms, at a cost of from $500 to $800; barn, $200.\r\n  One pair of horses and harness, $150; milch cow, $25; tools, $25; wood\r\n  is high, $7 per cord; flour, $3 to $4 per barrel of 200 lbs.; beef,\r\n  from 6 cts. to 10 cts. per lb.; hens, from $5 to $7 per dozen; eggs,\r\n  from 25 cts. to 50 cts. per dozen; building lumber, $25 per M. in the\r\n  valley or farming sections of the State. Male labor on the farm, $30\r\n  per month, except four or five months in the summer, when they receive\r\n  $1.50 to $2 per day. Female labor has never been ample, and commands\r\n  from $20 to $30 per month. Families coming out here can bring with\r\n  profit all clothing, bed-clothing, table cutlery and such articles as\r\n  would not be bulky. Large furniture or farming implements will not\r\n  bear transportation.\r\n\r\n  The very favorable conditions existing for small farming in this rich\r\n  valley of California, where water can be obtained to render crops\r\n  certain, are not generally known in the East and Europe. For instance,\r\n  our breadstuffs (wheat) must be shipped around Cape Horn to Liverpool\r\n  to find a market. Beef and pork the same. Our wool also has to go\r\n  around the Horn or across the Continent. The consequence is that the\r\n  fruit farmer eats the cheapest bread and beefsteak of any people in\r\n  the world. Our woolen mills are able to furnish the finest and\r\n  cheapest clothing worn. Labor is high, and everything the small farmer\r\n  produces is high, including poultry, vegetables and fruit, and will\r\n  always be so. The big farmer can’t get at this business with his steam\r\n  engine and long sickle. We can close Europe and the United States out\r\n  of the fruit-producing business, and force them to become consumers.\r\n  Why? Because of the certainty of our crops, and because we have the\r\n  whole valley for a drying house.\r\n\r\n  Address or call upon the undersigned, owners and proprietors,\r\n\r\n  V. C. W. HOOPER &.

G. Stabler\r\n  makes a specialty of dried peaches and seedless raisins, and has\r\n  succeeded well with both. The principal raisin-grape of this vicinity\r\n  is the little-known seedless grape, Lady Decoverly, here known as the\r\n  Thompson Seedless, he being the first to grow it. Years ago, about\r\n  1872, this gentleman saw advertised in an Eastern Catalogue a seedless\r\n  grape, said to come from Constantinople, and was called the Lady\r\n  Decoverly. It proved to be very different from the common Sultana,\r\n  being of yellow color, and of oblong shape. It is certainly strange\r\n  that this singular variety of grape should have existed here so many\r\n  years, and failed to attract general attention. It is an enormous\r\n  bearer, heavier even than the Sultana, and ripens early in August. It\r\n  makes very choice raisins for cooking purposes. The color is similar\r\n  to that of the Muscatel, and makes a raisin of beautiful color. Among\r\n  other novelties in the way of fruit, Mr. Stabler has a Chance Seedling\r\n  Apricot, which promises to be something extraordinary. It is not yet\r\n  in bearing, * * * but think of apricot leaves six inches in diameter,\r\n  and limbs many times as long and strong as those of ordinary apricot\r\n  trees,” etc.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n  FRESNO AND MERCED\r\n\r\n  COUNTY LANDS\r\n\r\n  TO RENT AND FOR SALE.\r\n\r\n  75,000 ACRES OF WHEAT AND SUGAR-BEET LAND in the above counties to\r\n  rent for a term of years; also =100,000 acres= of fine Raisin, Fruit,\r\n  Alfalfa and Sugar-Beet Land, with water for irrigation, for sale in\r\n  tracts of from twenty acres to large tracts suitable for colony\r\n  purposes.\r\n\r\n  For particulars apply to\r\n\r\n  E.

Besides\r\n  being so favorably located, they offer advantages which are not\r\n  possessed by any other lands in the State. The fifty-five thousand\r\n  acres, which are now for the first time subdivided, consist of virgin\r\n  pasture and wheat lands, which have become too valuable to be devoted\r\n  to their former use. They are now being irrigated by the most\r\n  expensive and magnificent irrigation system on the continent, by a\r\n  canal capable of carrying 4,000 cubic feet of water per second, and by\r\n  the artificial lake Yosemite, the most extensive irrigation reservoir\r\n  ever built in America. The water from this system is abundant and\r\n  continuous; it comes from the snow-capped Sierra, from the Falls of\r\n  the Yosemite, and will suffice to irrigate and fertilize hundreds of\r\n  thousands of acres more than are offered for sale.\r\n\r\n  These fruit and horticultural lands are situated in the warm belt of\r\n  the foot-hills of the Sierra Nevada, protected by sheltering hills,\r\n  traversed by natural creeks and surrounded by the grandest scenery\r\n  known to man. The famous Yosemite is almost within sight, and the\r\n  high-peaked Sierra can be reached in a day’s journey. The Coast Range,\r\n  with Mt. Diablo, is in full view, while the fresh breezes from the San\r\n  Pablo Bay temper the climate, and contribute to make it one of the\r\n  finest, most salubrious and most enjoyable in the world. Through the\r\n  irrigation water always at the command of the horticulturist, our\r\n  lands are being transformed into beautiful orchards, vineyards and\r\n  meadows. The peach, the prune, the apricot, the pear and the\r\n  raisin-grape are made to flourish, and the olive to produce its\r\n  valuable oil, the orange and the lemon their golden fruit. The\r\n  colonies already established are situated in the thermal belt of the\r\n  Sierra, in the finest citrus region of the State, in a district equal\r\n  to the best anywhere, and in a territory remarkable for its earliness\r\n  and productiveness. Every variety of temperate and semi-tropical fruit\r\n  is now growing within sight of the colonies,--the almond, the olive\r\n  and orange upon the more elevated land; the peach, the prune, the\r\n  apricot, the pear and the raisin-grape upon that of a more alluvial\r\n  nature. The Rotterdam Colony contains now over a hundred settlers from\r\n  Holland; other colonies are being established by English and American\r\n  farmers, by doctors, lawyers and professional men of every station in\r\n  life. The people whom we invite, and who have responded to our call,\r\n  are the most desirable, the most intelligent, the most energetic and\r\n  the most refined classes. They are now building up horticultural\r\n  communities of the most prosperous nature.\r\n\r\n  The lands we offer are situated six hours by railroad from San\r\n  Francisco. They are traversed by two railroads, and the principal\r\n  colony is only four miles from Merced City, the county seat, while\r\n  some of our land joins, and actually surrounds, that town. Our prices\r\n  are low, and our terms very reasonable. We offer various grades of\r\n  land, all eminently suitable for the highest state of horticulture, at\r\n  prices ranging from $75 to $175 per acre, with water.\r\n\r\n  For particulars address the\r\n\r\n  Crocker-Huffman Land and Water Company,\r\n\r\n  MERCED,\r\n\r\n  Merced County, Cal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber’s Notes\r\n\r\n\r\n  Inconsistent and unusual spelling, hyphenation and capitalisation have\r\n  been retained, unless mentioned below; this also applies to\r\n  non-English words and phrases.\r\n\r\n  Robert McPherson and Robert MacPherson are presumably the same person.\r\n\r\n  Page 29, table: the data given do not add up to the totals given.\r\n\r\n  Page 216, Audibert: the full title is L’Art de faire le vin avec les\r\n  raisins secs.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Changes made:\r\n\r\n  Some minor punctuation and typographical errors have been corrected\r\n  silently.\r\n\r\n  Footnotes have been moved to directly under the paragraph where they\r\n  are referenced.\r\n\r\n  Several tables have been split or otherwise re-arranged to fit the\r\n  available width.\r\n\r\n  Page  ii  The Raisin Grapes moved up one level as in text;\r\n  Page   6  Venitians changed to Venetians; _Dipped and Sultana_ changed\r\n            to _Dipped_ and _Sultana_;\r\n  Page   7  Dodoen’s changed to Dodoens’s;\r\n  Page  10  elemes changed to elemês; Pantallaria changed to\r\n            Pantellaria;\r\n  Page  15  known as Velencias changed to known as Valencias;\r\n  Page  26  Ionion Islands changed to Ionian Islands;\r\n  Page  31  Stan-chio changed to Stanchio;\r\n  Page  96, illustration caption: _c._ changed to _b._; its Tuberous\r\n            Mycelium changed to their Tuberous Mycelium;\r\n  Page 119  illustration captions combined into single caption;\r\n  Page 133  as high-grade raisins changed to as many high-grade raisins;\r\n  Page 182  about a feet deep changed to about a foot deep;\r\n  Page 205  Shacht changed to Schacht;\r\n  Page 214  table row Mau, Sadler & Co. moved to before Miller, James;\r\n            Schact changed to Schacht;\r\n  Page 217  Grasset de Saint Sauveur, Jacque changed to Grasset de Saint\r\n            Sauveur, Jacques; Noveau Duhamel On Traité des Arbres ...\r\n            changed to Nouveau Duhamel ou Traité des Arbres ...; Rambert\r\n            changed to Rembert;\r\n  Page 218  varietés changed to variétés;\r\n  Page 219  Aetolico changed to Ætolico; Albunol changed to\r\n            Albuñol; Cascalira changed to Cascalina; Cooper, Elwood\r\n            changed to Cooper, Ellwood;\r\n  Page 220  Crocker-Hoffman Reservoir changed to Crocker-Huffman\r\n            Reservoir; Eleme changed to Elemê; Gargalino changed\r\n            to Gargaliano;\r\n  Page 222  Sweat-boxes changed to Sweatboxes; Entry Quality of Raisins\r\n            moved to before Racemus;\r\n  Index     some page numbers have been corrected.",
