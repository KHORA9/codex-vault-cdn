CURTIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was intended by the Author to publish an exhaustive practical work\r\non Dairying. But his time was so occupied by other matters that he was\r\ncompelled to abandon the idea. Much of the following pages was written\r\nwhile traveling, the intervals of waiting at hotels and railroad\r\nstations being devoted to this work. But on reperusing the chapters\r\nas they appeared in the columns of the FARMER AND DAIRYMAN,\r\nand making slight additions, he has concluded to give them to the\r\nDairy Public in their present form, believing that they may be of some\r\nassistance to the tyro, and perhaps afford a hint, here and there,\r\nto the dairyman of more experience who wishes to keep abreast of his\r\nfellows in the march of progress. This little book is not intended to\r\nsupersede any other work on the subject, but to play the part of an\r\nauxiliary and present in a condensed form the pith which the reader\r\nmight not have time to get from a more elaborate volume. The favor with\r\nwhich his \"Hints on Cheesmaking\"--now out of date--was received, gives\r\nthe author confidence that his later effort may serve to fill a place\r\nthat now remains unoccupied. Providence seems to have selected him as\r\none of the laborers in this field of education, and he conscientiously\r\ndevotes a portion of his energies to the service with envy toward none,\r\nbut entertaining the hope that his mite may not be unacceptable among\r\nso many larger contributions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          HINTS ON DAIRYING.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORICAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nDairying runs back to a period in the development of the human race of\r\nwhich we have no record. Man early learned to not only slay animals and\r\neat their flesh, but to appropriate to himself the food belonging to\r\ntheir young--a trait of selfishness which he has not yet overcome, and\r\neven manifests by preying in various ways upon his fellows. We have in\r\nthe world large classes who add nothing to its real wealth, but live\r\nand luxuriate on the fat of the earth by drawing the results of labor\r\nfrom the toilers through cunningly devised schemes of finance, business\r\nand government.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN ASIA.\r\n\r\nAway back in the dimness of antiquity, of which even tradition gives no\r\nhint, comparative philology shows us that a civilized race, now known\r\nas the Aryan race, dwelt on the steppes of Central Asia, and that the\r\nox and the cow constituted their chief means of subsistence. They lived\r\nin simple peace and innocence, their language having no terms of war\r\nand strife. But there came a time when separation began and migration\r\nfollowed. They were scattered to the four corners of the Eastern\r\nContinent, and their descendants now constitute the progressive nations\r\nof the earth. The parent nation appears to have utterly perished in\r\ngiving birth to the nations of the future. No trace of it is left,\r\nsave the remnants of its language inherited by its children; but they\r\nfurnish indisputable evidence of a common parentage.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMONG THE JEWS.\r\n\r\nOur earliest authentic records about the dairy are of the use of milk\r\nand its products among the Jews. We are told, in the 8th verse of\r\nthe 18th chapter of Genesis, that when Abraham entertained the three\r\nstrangers, \"he took butter and milk, and the calf which he had dressed,\r\nand set it before them.\" Moses, in his song, as recorded in the 23d\r\nchapter of Deuteronomy, 14th verse, says of Jacob that the Lord, among\r\nother things, gave him to eat \"butter of kine and milk of sheep.\"\r\nDeborah, who declares in her song that \"the stars in their courses did\r\nfight against Sisera,\" who was entertained and slain by Jael, says of\r\nthe murderess (Judges, 25th verse and 8th chapter) \"he asked water\r\nand she gave him milk, she brought forth butter in a lordly dish.\"\r\nIn the 17th chapter and 5th verse of 2d Samuel, the writer tells us\r\nthat David and his people, after the battle in the wood of Ephraim,\r\nwere given \"honey and butter, and sheep and cheese of kine,\" to eat.\r\nZophar, in the 20th chapter of Job, 17th verse, declares of the wicked\r\nhypocrite, who \"hath swallowed down riches,\" that his triumph is short,\r\nand \"he shall not see the rivers, the floods, the brooks of honey and\r\nbutter\"--which, we infer, are designed for the righteous; and Job (29th\r\nchapter and 6th verse) bemoans the loss of his former prosperity,\r\n\"when I washed my steps with butter.\" In the 55th Psalm, 24th verse,\r\nDavid says of his enemy that \"the words of his mouth were smoother\r\nthan butter.\" Solomon appears to have understood the whole business.\r\nIn Proverbs, 30th chapter and 33d verse, he exclaims: \"Surely, the\r\nchurning of milk bringeth forth butter.\" Isaiah, in the 7th chapter and\r\n15th verse, declares of the coming Immanuel, that \"butter and honey\r\nshall he eat;\" and again (22d verse) that \"for the abundance of milk\r\nthat they shall give he shall eat butter.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIN SOUTHERN EUROPE.\r\n\r\nChambers says: \"In ancient times, the Hebrews seem to have made\r\ncopious use of butter as food; but the Greeks and the Romans used it\r\nonly as an ointment in their baths, and it is probable that the Greeks\r\nobtained their knowledge of the subject from the Scythians, Thracians,\r\nand Phrygians, whilst the Romans obtained it of Germany.\" This would\r\nindicate that the Germans at that time were engaged in dairying. But,\r\neven now, in Southern Europe, butter is sparingly used, and in Italy,\r\nSpain, Portugal and Southern France, it is sold by apothecaries as an\r\nointment. Dairying is now extensively carried on in all the countries\r\nof Northern Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN AMERICA.\r\n\r\nWhen the early settlers of America crossed the Atlantic, they brought\r\nwith them their favorite domestic animals, including the family cow.\r\nBut dairying for a long time, in this country, appears to have been\r\nconfined mainly to producing supplies for the family of the dairyman.\r\nIt was not until quite a recent date that dairying sprang into\r\ncommercial importance. But, to-day, dairying cannot be considered\r\nsecond to any other industry as to either magnitude or importance; and\r\nit is a patent fact that, in those sections where dairying is most\r\nextensively and successfully carried on, the farming population is the\r\nmost prosperous and happy.\r\n\r\nWithin the last twenty years, since associated dairying has been\r\nintroduced, great progress has been made in the dairy--but not greater\r\nthan in many other occupations, nor out of proportion with the growth\r\nof population. The growth of the dairy will probably never exceed the\r\ngrowth of population so long as the present heavy tide of immigration\r\ncontinues to set toward our shores.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIGURES FROM THE CENSUS.\r\n\r\nLet us refer to the census of 1880, and note the development of the\r\ndairy during the previous 30 years:\r\n\r\nBy the census of 1850, we had 6,385,094 cows, and produced 314,345,306\r\npounds of butter, and 105,535,893 pounds of cheese--a total of\r\n418,881,199 pounds of product.\r\n\r\nBy the census of 1860, we had 8,585,735 cows, and produced 459,681,372\r\npounds of butter, and 103,663,927 pounds of cheese--a total of\r\n563,345,299 pounds of product.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the census of 1870, we had 8,935,332 cows and produced 514,692,683\r\npounds of butter, and 162,927,382 pounds of cheese--a total of\r\n677,620,065 pounds of product--and this notwithstanding the war of the\r\nrebellion came in this decade.\r\n\r\nBy the census of 1880, we had 12,443,120 cows, and produced 803,662,071\r\npounds of butter, and 243,157,850 pounds of cheese--a total of\r\n1,049,819,921 pounds of product.\r\n\r\n\r\nGROWTH IN THIRTY YEARS.\r\n\r\nThis is an increase in annual product of 630,948,622 pounds in thirty\r\nyears, or 212,057,523 pounds more than double the amount, in 1880, that\r\nwas manufactured in 1850. History records no parallel to this anywhere\r\non the face of the globe.\r\n\r\nLet us put some of these figures into tabular form. We had in\r\n\r\n                          Cows            Inhabitants\r\n\r\n    1880                12,443,120   to   50,155,783\r\n\r\n    1850                 6,385,094   to   23,191,876\r\n                         ---------        ----------\r\n    Increase in 30 years 6,058,026        26,963,907\r\n\r\nWe did not quite double the number of cows, but considerably more than\r\ndoubled the population. The number of inhabitants was, in\r\n\r\n    1850      3.63 per cow\r\n\r\n    1880      4.03    \"\r\n\r\nThe increase in 30 years is .40 inhabitant to each cow. That is to\r\nsay, the population, as compared with the number of cows, was .40\r\nlarger in 1880 than it was in 1850.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRODUCT PER COW AND PER CAPITA.\r\n\r\nAnd now let us compare the product per cow and per capita. It was in\r\n\r\n                                Lbs. per   Lbs. per\r\n                                   cow     capita\r\n\r\n    1850     418,881,199 lbs., or 65.77 or 18.06\r\n    1880   1,049,829,921 lbs., or 84.37 or 20.93\r\n                                  -----    -----\r\n    Increase in 30 years          18.60     2.87\r\n\r\n\r\nHOME CONSUMPTION VS. EXPORTS.\r\n\r\nBut it should be borne in mind that in 1850 very nearly all our dairy\r\nproducts were consumed at home; whereas in 1880, we exported a large\r\namount. As the exports do not all come in the year of production, we\r\nwill take the average amount of exports for 1879 and 1880:\r\n\r\n                   Lbs. Butter.    Lbs. Cheese.\r\n\r\n    Exports, 1879   38,248,016     141,654,474\r\n       \"     1880   39,236,658     127,553,907\r\n                    ----------     -----------\r\n    Divided by    2)77,484,674     269,208,381\r\n                    ----------     -----------\r\n    Yearly average  38,742,337     134,604,190\r\n    Add butter and cheese together  38,742,337\r\n                                   -----------\r\n    We have a yearly av. export of 173,346,527\r\n\r\npounds of product. If we take this from the total product\r\n\r\n    of 1880      1,049,829,921 pounds\r\n                   173,346,527 pounds\r\n                 -------------\r\n    we have        876,483,394 pounds\r\n\r\nof product for home consumption, or more than five times as much as\r\nwe export. This is a consumption of 17.47 pounds per capita for our\r\n50,155,783 inhabitants, or .59 of a pound less than in 1850, when\r\nit was 18.60 pounds per capita. Does not this indicate the folly of\r\ncatering for a foreign market to the neglect of our own?\r\n\r\n\r\nFORMS OF MILK CONSUMPTION.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated by good judges that 45 per cent. of our milk product is\r\nconsumed in its natural state, 50 per cent. is used in butter making,\r\nand 5 per cent. is made into cheese. The fact of there being a foreign\r\ndemand for so large a proportion of our cheese, has led everybody\r\nastray, and magnified the cheese factory into the position of supreme\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRIVATE DAIRY VS. THE FACTORY.\r\n\r\nLet us again turn to the census of 1880, and see how the factory\r\nproduct compares in amount and importance with the product of the\r\nprivate dairy. It appears by the census of 1880 that the number of\r\npounds of dairy products made in factories was as follows:\r\n\r\n    Cheese made in factories    215,885,361 lbs.\r\n    Butter  \"    \"    \"          29,411,784  \"\r\n                                -----------\r\n        Total factory product   245,307,145 lbs.\r\n\r\n    Cheese made on farms         27,272,489 lbs.\r\n    Butter  \"    \"  \"           777,250,287  \"\r\n                                -----------\r\n        Total farm product      804,522,776 lbs.\r\n    Deduct factory product      245,307,145  \"\r\n                                -----------\r\n        Excess of private dairy 559,215,631 lbs.\r\n\r\nor considerably more than double the total factory product.\r\n\r\nNow, let us make a comparison by values, calling the cheese 10 cents\r\nand the butter 25 cents a pound. We made in factories:\r\n\r\n    Cheese, 215,885,361 lbs., @ 1Oc. $21,538,536\r\n    Butter,  29,411,784 lbs., @ 25c.   7,352,946\r\n                                      ----------\r\n        Value of factory product     $29,941,482\r\n\r\nThere was made in the private dairies:\r\n\r\n    Cheese,  27,272,489 lbs., @ 10c. $  2,727,249\r\n    Butter, 777,250,287 lbs., @ 25c.  194,312,571\r\n                                      -----------\r\n    Value of private dairy products  $197,039,820\r\n    Deduct value of factory products   29,941,482\r\n                                      -----------\r\n    In favor of private dairy        $167,098,338\r\n\r\nIn short, the product of the private dairy is between three and four\r\ntimes larger than that of the factory, and nearly seven times its\r\nvalue. Important as the factory is and is likely to become, let us not\r\nforget the private dairy nor overlook the home interest in striving for\r\na little foreign patronage.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the fault with the census that is found by some, the\r\ncensus is the most reliable source of statistical information about the\r\ndairy that we have.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONDITIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not every novice that can take up the business of dairying and\r\ncarry it on successfully; yet, some of our most successful dairymen\r\nare comparative novices in the business. Quick observation and sound\r\njudgment are important qualities in a dairyman. These qualities are not\r\nalways acquired by long experience, but are oftener the generous gifts\r\nof nature. Hence, it frequently happens that men of quick discernment\r\nstep into a new business and achieve success where others have met\r\nonly years of failure. Improvements in all callings are apt to be made\r\nby sharp lookers-on, who are not bred in the habits of routinism, nor\r\nprejudiced against radical innovations. They see at a glance where\r\nthe plodder fails, and fearlessly apply the remedy--often a short-cut\r\nto ends that have hitherto been reached with much difficulty and hard\r\nlabor. And here is where the real inventor finds his greatest field of\r\nusefulness.\r\n\r\n\r\nPASTURES.\r\n\r\nSweet pastures, with a variety of nutritious grasses growing in them,\r\nare essentials to success in dairying--especially in butter making--in\r\nsummer. Bitter and other mal flavored weeds must be avoided, as they\r\nflavor both the milk and the product manufactured from it. The cows\r\nmust not be worried, nor over-worked in rambling over poor pastures to\r\nget sufficient food.\r\n\r\n\r\nWATER.\r\n\r\nPlenty of clean water must be conveniently at hand for the cows to\r\ndrink. The water must be sweet and clean enough for the human stomach.\r\nAbundance of such water is more essential in the pasture--for the cows\r\nto drink while secreting milk that contains 87 per cent. of water--than\r\nit is in the daily-house, where a small amount of water will answer, if\r\nice is used, and hence can more easily be obtained pure.\r\n\r\n\r\nWINTER FOOD.\r\n\r\nIn winter, the food must be in proper condition, properly balanced\r\nbetween the nitrogenous and carbonaceous materials, and in full\r\nsupply--all the cow can digest and assimilate. At least one ration a\r\nday should include sweet ensilage, roots, or other succulent food, to\r\naid in the separation of the butter from the cream by action of the\r\nchurn, it having been shown that all dry feed not only reduces the\r\nflow of milk, but makes churning slow and difficult, leaving a large\r\npercentage of fat in the buttermilk.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STABLE.\r\n\r\nWhile in stable, the cow must also have plenty of pure air and sweet\r\nwater, and not be chilled in obtaining either. Without pure air,\r\nthe cow becomes debilitated and diseased, and the milk impure and\r\nunwholesome. Impure water both taints and corrupts the product. A\r\nproper temperature--certainly above freezing--should be kept up.\r\nRemember, the cow standing still cannot resist cold as she could if she\r\nwere free to move about. It is cheaper to build warm stables--always\r\nproviding for perfect ventilation, the air coming in at the head and\r\npassing off in the rear of the cow--and even to resort to artificial\r\nheating, than to compel the cow to burn an extra amount of carbonaceous\r\nfood in her system to keep up the temperature of her body. Not only is\r\nfuel cheaper than food, but the system of the cow cannot devote to milk\r\nsecretion the energy which is expending in secreting and consuming fat\r\nto maintain a proper amount of vital heat.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHELTER.\r\n\r\nProper shelter in summer, from the scorching rays of the mid-day sun,\r\nand from beating storms and winds, is necessary. This should be easily\r\naccessible. Especially in early spring and late fall do the animals\r\nsuffer severely from exposure to the cold winds and storms of all hours\r\nin the twenty-four.\r\n\r\n\r\nDAIRY HOUSE.\r\n\r\nEvery dairyman should have a good dairy house distinct from the\r\ndwelling apartments. It need not, necessarily, be a separate building,\r\nbut it should not be subject to the inflowing of odors from the kitchen\r\nand sitting rooms. The dairy house should be so constructed that the\r\ntemperature may at all times be kept under perfect control. There\r\nshould be no surrounding cesspools or other malodorous sources of\r\ntaint, and the ventilation should be free without perceptible drafts or\r\ncurrents of air. No matter what method of setting milk and churning may\r\nbe adopted, there is a decided advantage in having the dairy house, or\r\nany other workshop, separate from the dwelling apartments, so that the\r\nwork of the one shall in no way interfere with the work of the other.\r\nAlmost all dairymen fail, to some extent, in not having the dairy\r\nhouse entirely separate. It would cost but little extra; and until\r\ndairymen look upon the business as their life work and build and plan\r\naccordingly, we need not expect the best possible success in dairying.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLEANLINESS.\r\n\r\nCleanliness everywhere and at all times is an absolute necessity. There\r\nis not the least danger of being too clean. The writer has never yet\r\nseen a dairy without defects in this particular. Yet, most people mean\r\nto be clean, and suppose they are. Lack of information is often the\r\ncause of uncleanliness, and habit goes a great way in making people\r\nindifferent to untidy surroundings. It is safe to copy the neat points\r\nfound in every dairy, as well as to avoid the offensive ones. As Gov.\r\nSeymour once said, \"cleanliness is a comparative term.\" It is well to\r\nkeep making comparisons on this point, until no unfavorable comparisons\r\nwith anybody's dairy can be found; and these comparisons should extend\r\nto the surroundings of the cows, the manner of milking, the handling\r\nof the milk, the cleansing of milk utensils, and all the processes of\r\nmanipulation from beginning to end. The dairy house should not only\r\nlook clean, but be, as it were, fragrant with neatness and sweetness.\r\nAnd it is all-important that the clothing and person should be clean\r\nand neat to a fault. A sweet temper, even is no drawback.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HERD.\r\n\r\nOf course, a thorough knowledge of the business must be had or be\r\nacquired. The proper selection or rearing of dairy stock is essential\r\nto success. The cow should not only be a good milker, but give milk\r\nsuited to the line of dairying pursued. If cheese making is the object,\r\nthere must be a large flow of milk rich in caseine. In butter making,\r\na large flow of milk is not essential, but there must be a large\r\npercentage of fat in it. And the breeding must be such as to keep up\r\nthe status of the herd. Some depend on purchasing cows, and exercise\r\ngreat care and judgment in so doing. In exceptional cases, a herd may\r\nbe kept up in this way. But somebody must breed and rear good cows, or\r\nsoon none can be had at any price. As a rule, it may be said to be the\r\nduty of every dairyman to breed from the best blood obtainable, and\r\nto rear the heifer calves from his best cows. Unless this condition\r\nis fulfilled, the dairy as a whole must run down. It is only by\r\nconstant care and breeding from the best that the present status can\r\nbe maintained, and possibly a little progress made. It should be the\r\nambition of every dairyman to constantly improve the value of his herd,\r\nand to make progress in every department of his dairy, while improving\r\nthe quality of his product.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDAIRY STOCK.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no more important subject connected with the dairy than\r\nthat of the selection and rearing of stock. The herd is the fountain\r\nhead. If there is failure here there is failure everywhere. Many a\r\ndairyman has remained poor all his days because he spent his time\r\nand energies on an unprofitable herd. This is the first thing to be\r\nlooked after. The selection of a herd is a matter of both knowledge\r\nand judgment--knowledge of the characteristics of breeds and of\r\nthe requisites of a good dairy cow, and judgment as to whether\r\nthe individual cow in question possesses these characteristics\r\nand requisites. We will give some of the generally acknowledged\r\ncharacteristics of the different breeds, first indicating, as far as we\r\ncan in words, some of the points of a good dairy cow.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOINTS OF A MILKER.\r\n\r\nThe dairy cow should be deep and broad through the flank--deeper and\r\nbroader than through the shoulders--but must have a comparatively large\r\nchest, giving capacity of lungs and stomach, for she must have good\r\ndigestive powers and inhale plenty of fresh air. Her hips should be\r\nbroad, setting her thighs well apart, and her thighs should be rather\r\nthin. This gives space for a large udder, which is indispensable, for\r\nit is unreasonable to expect a large flow of milk from an udder of\r\nsmall capacity. The udder should be soft and fleshless when empty, and\r\nextend high up in the rear. It should also extend well forward, and\r\nfrom it should extend further forward large, protruding milk-veins. If\r\nthey are double and are crooked and knotty, all the better. These veins\r\ncarry off the blood after it has passed through the udder and performed\r\nits part in elaborating milk, and their size indicates the amount of\r\nblood employed, and by inference the amount of milk secreted. So the\r\nescutcheon, which should extend out on the thighs and run with even\r\nedges and unbroken surface up to or near the vulva, is supposed to be\r\nsome indication of the extent of the arterial system that contributes\r\nblood for the elaboration of milk. The neck should be slender, taper\r\nand thin, the horns small and slender, the face dishing or flat, the\r\neyes wide apart and mild and intelligent in expression, the muzzle\r\nbroad when viewed from the front but thin when viewed from the side,\r\nand the lips thick and strong. A long, slender tail is indicative of\r\ngood breeding. A yellow skin, or one which secretes an oily yellow\r\nscurf--especially seen in the ears, along the back and at the end of\r\nthe tail--is considered a sign of milk rich in fat. The skin should be\r\nsoft and pliable, the hair fine, and the coat glossy. We prefer rather\r\nlight to very dark colors. Our observation is that a black cow never\r\ngives as rich milk as one in which the white predominates. In other\r\ncolors we have not noted such a difference. Viewed from the front, the\r\ngeneral shape of the cow should be a little wedging--thinner in front\r\nand thicker in the rear. Viewed from the side, the cow should taper\r\nfrom rear to front, with the upper and lower lines generally straight,\r\nwith little or no, slope from the rump to the tail.\r\n\r\n\r\nDUTCH-FRIESIAN.\r\n\r\nFor general or all purposes, the Dutch-Friesian cow is not excelled.\r\nShe may be equaled, but where is her superior? We use the name\r\nDutch-Friesian because it expresses precisely what we mean--the black\r\nand white cattle of Friesian origin which have been bred pure in\r\nFriesland or North Holland, and not the cattle called \"Holstein\" in\r\nthis country, which have been picked up promiscuously in the different\r\nprovinces of Germany, because of their peculiar markings, but without\r\nreference to their breeding. Some of these may be pure bred, but they\r\nare liable to disappoint the honest purchaser, who buys them for and\r\npays the price of pure bloods. The Dutch-Friesian cow is large, readily\r\ntakes on flesh when not in milk, and therefore makes splendid beef.\r\nShe is hardy, docile and easily cared for. No other breed equals her\r\nin yield of milk. Her milk is of average richness, and she gives so\r\nmuch of it that it makes her valuable as a butter cow. Microscopists\r\nsay the fat globules in her milk are very small. This makes it somewhat\r\ndifficult to separate the fats from the milk for the purposes of butter\r\nmaking. Though the fat globules are quite uniform in size, it requires\r\na long time to raise the cream by the ordinary methods, and the\r\nseparation is not complete; but this makes the skim-milk all the more\r\nvaluable for cheese making, feeding, or to market. With the centrifuge,\r\nthere would be no difficulty in getting out all the cream. For market,\r\nor family use, or for cheese making, the milk of the Dutch-Friesian\r\ncow, because of the slowness with which the cream separates from the\r\nmilk, is superior. It is rich in caseine, and therefore very valuable\r\nfor cheese making. We could not recommend any other breed with greater\r\nconfidence. Dutch-Friesian grades--the result of using pure-blooded\r\nDutch-Friesian bulls on common or other stock--make very valuable dairy\r\nstock.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Dutch-Friesian Bull, MOOIE, 26 D.F.H.B.\r\n\r\n    Property of the Unadilla Valley Stock Breeders' Association,\r\n    Whitestown, N.Y.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Dutch-Friesian Cow, JACOBA HARTOG, 2 D.F.H.B.\r\n\r\n    Property of the Unadilla Valley Stock Breeders' Association,\r\n    Whitestown, N.Y.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE JERSEY.\r\n\r\nPerhaps as widely separated from the Dutch-Friesian cow as any breed is\r\nthe Jersey. She certainly is the smallest of all as the Dutch-Friesian\r\nis the largest--unless we except the Shorthorn and Hereford. The\r\nJersey gives a small mess of milk, but it is very rich in fat, and\r\nthe fat readily separates from the milk, leaving the skim-milk very\r\nblue and poor. It is not generally considered very rich in caseine,\r\nand it is therefore as poor and worthless as skim-milk well can be.\r\nBut, considering size, the Jersey is conceded to yield more butter\r\nthan any other breed. The cream globules are said to be very large\r\nand very uniform in size. Hence, they not only readily separate from\r\nthe milk, but churn easily. The Jersey is out of the question as a\r\nbeef animal, there is so little of her carcass; but we never heard\r\ncomplaint of the quality of the meat. But lack of beef qualities we\r\ndo not consider a very serious objection in a dairy cow. We get our\r\nprofit from her in the dairy. We cannot reasonably expect all good\r\nqualities in one animal or one breed. Nature is nowhere thus partial\r\nin her gifts. We find some good quality predominating in every one of\r\nthe several breeds, and we must select accordingly to suit our line of\r\ndairying and our circumstances. The Jersey is a fawn-like, beautiful\r\nanimal, with a mild eye and intelligent face, but usually has a quite\r\nangular frame, as a consequence of her excessive dairy qualities. She\r\nis rather tender, and cannot bear the exposure and harsh treatment that\r\nsome of the breeds can. But no animal ought to receive such treatment.\r\nKindness and comfortable quarters are due to all domestic animals, and\r\nsuch care, with proper feed, is the most profitable to the owner. The\r\nJersey will not stand harsh usage; but for the man of refined taste and\r\ngood judgment, who wants a nice thing and to turn out fancy goods, she\r\nis most decidedly the cow, and will not disappoint him. Solid colors\r\nand black muzzles are the fashion in Jerseys, but we are not aware\r\nthat there is any practical merit in these. They have been bred down\r\nin size, to suit the taste of the English Lord, who wants them as pets\r\non his lawns. This is rather against than in favor of the Jersey as a\r\ndairy cow, as it must of necessity reduce her capacity for converting\r\nfood into milk and cream.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GUERNSEY.\r\n\r\nThere are but few of these animals as yet in this country, but the few\r\nthat have been imported and bred here have proved very satisfactory\r\nand promising. They are pale red or buff red and white. The colors are\r\nabout in equal proportions, though the red may predominate. They are\r\nconsiderably larger than the Jersey and possess all the good qualities\r\nof the latter. Indeed, there is pretty good evidence that these\r\nbreeds have the same origin, and that the Jersey is the Guernsey bred\r\ndown in size and bred also for solid colors. The Guernsey is just as\r\nbeautiful in face and form as the Jersey, and we think rather hardier\r\nand possesses more capacity. For all practical purposes, we should be\r\ninclined to give preference to the Guernsey, which has no rival in\r\nher line, except the Jersey. This breed can lay claim to some beef\r\nqualities, because of its size. It is destined to become a popular\r\nfavorite in the butter dairy and as a family cow.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AYRSHIRE.\r\n\r\nThis breed is a great favorite with many. It is small--scarcely larger\r\nthan the Guernsey--and is remarkably nimble and hardy, thriving on\r\nscant feed and in rough pastures where some of the other breeds would\r\nstarve. The Ayrshires are red or red and white and give a large flow\r\nof milk, fairly rich in caseine and in butter. The breed has its\r\nphenomenal cows, both as milkers and as butter makers. The cream\r\nglobules of the milk are quite irregular in size, and hence do not\r\nreadily separate from the milk by ordinary methods of cream raising.\r\nBut this fact makes the milk all the better for family use, for\r\nmarketing and for the cheese factory, or for both butter and cheese\r\nfrom the same milk. The Ayrshire, like the Dutch-Friesian, may be\r\ncalled a good general purpose cow. The greatest objections to this\r\nbreed have been its nervousness and its small teats; but both of these\r\nmay be overcome by gentle treatment and careful breeding--indeed, have\r\nbeen overcome in many cases. For rough, hilly pastures, there is no\r\nbetter cow than the Ayrshire. But although she can stand some hard\r\nfare, she responds quickly to gentle and generous usage. Well-selected\r\nand well-bred Ayrshires make a splendid dairy herd.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SHORTHORN.\r\n\r\nThis has long been a popular breed, and there may be said to be a\r\nstrong popular prejudice in its favor. Its undisputed, and perhaps\r\nunequaled, beef qualities have been its strongest recommend. It was,\r\nhowever, originally a milch breed, and some families of the breed are\r\nstill hard to excel for the dairy. But it is quite difficult to select\r\nand maintain a milking strain, so long have the Shorthorns been bred\r\nfor \"beef and beauty,\" and so effectually have the milking qualities\r\nbeen bred out of them. In some of the beef families, the cows do not\r\ngive milk enough to support their calves. Yet, many dairymen cling to\r\nthis breed and keep unprofitable dairies because they can get a good\r\nprice for the old carcass as beef when the cow is no longer tolerable\r\nin the dairy herd. This is short-sightedness, and holding beef for\r\nmarket too long and at too great a cost. The profit should be in\r\nthe dairy products, where a dairy herd is kept, and beef should be\r\naltogether a subordinate consideration. The Shorthorn is usually red or\r\nroan, and occasionally red and white, though we always suspect other\r\nblood--Ayrshire, for instance--in the spotted animals. As a rule, we\r\ndo not consider the Shorthorns as really profitable dairy cows, though\r\nthere are many exceptions where a milking strain is cultivated. But\r\nthere is no disputing their value for beef.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: GUERNSEY BULL, \"LORD FERNWOOD.\" PROPERTY OF L.W.\r\n    LEDYARD, FERNWOOD FARM, CAZENOVIA, N.Y.]\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: GUERNSEY COW, \"COUNTESS OF FERNWOOD.\" PROPERTY OF\r\n    L.W. LEDYARD, FERNWOOD FARM, CAZENOVIA, N.Y.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEVON.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the choicest and most reliable of the dairy breeds.\r\nThey are uniformly red, of fair size, have a sprightly appearance, and\r\nreproduce their like more certainly than any other breed that we know.\r\nAs has been said, they are so prepotent, uniform, and distinct from\r\nthe other breeds that they may be called a _race_ of cattle. Their\r\nhistory runs back hundreds of years, until it is lost in tradition and\r\nuncertainty. But origin and history are of little consequence, since it\r\nis the living fact--the cattle themselves--that we have to deal with.\r\nThe cows give a good sized mess of milk--large milkers have appeared\r\namong them as among other breeds--and their milk is very rich. It is\r\nnot as rich as the Jersey's and the Guernsey's milk, but there is more\r\nof it, and it approximates the richness of the milk of these breeds\r\nmore closely than that of any other. Hence, they are excellent butter\r\ncows, and justly favorites among those who are the most familiar with\r\nthem and know how to breed them. Healthy, hardy, and easy to keep,\r\nthey are adapted to almost any circumstances, and are excellent as\r\nbutter or family cows, while the males, owing to their activity and\r\nendurance, make splendid oxen--both useful and fine looking. They make\r\nfine beef and a fair amount of it. They would be useful animals for\r\ncrossing on the common stock and grades of the Northwest, where the\r\nclimate is rigorous and both butter and beef are objects of importance.\r\nAs workers, they would be very useful there. They will stand as much\r\nhardship as any breed we have, and as much as any breed ought to, but\r\nwill do better under favorable than under unfavorable circumstances.\r\nLike all other breeds, they respond readily to kind and generous\r\ntreatment, it being a universal law that want and abuse are sources of\r\nloss in the keeping of stock, the best results always following the\r\nbest treatment. They will do well on level, hilly or rough pastures,\r\nbecause of their nimbleness and endurance: while the certainty of their\r\nbreeding makes it perhaps less difficult to perpetuate their good\r\nqualities than is the case with any of the other breeds. In short,\r\nthey are the most prepotent and uniform of all, give a good-sized\r\nmess of very rich milk, are easy to keep, hardy and active, and fill\r\na sphere which it would be difficult to fill without them. We do not\r\nknow how their milk appears under the microscope, but we judge from the\r\ncharacteristics of these animals that the butter globules are above\r\nthe average size and very uniform. Hence the cream rises readily, is\r\neasily churned, and makes a rich-colored, fine-flavored butter. It is a\r\nlittle remarkable that the breeders of these cattle have not succeeded\r\nin getting up a \"boom;\" but the probability is that no strenuous and\r\npersistent effort has been made in this direction. Their superior\r\nmerits are unquestioned and unquestionable.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AMERICAN HOLDERNESS.\r\n\r\nThis is a new breed, and its reputation is mainly of a local character.\r\nBut it is not without its representatives in most of the Northern and\r\nNorthwestern States, and its fame has traveled quite extensively,\r\nconsidering the quiet and unpretentious manner in which it was\r\noriginated and has been bred. In some particulars it is the most\r\nuniform of the breeds, even more uniform than the Devon. Especially is\r\nthis true of the quality of the milk, which is as uniform throughout\r\nthe herd as if it were drawn from a single cow, the quality varying,\r\nwhere the keep is the same, only with the age of the cow, and the lapse\r\nof time since calving. The yield of milk, though not excessive, is\r\nlarge and very rich--almost equal to that of the Jersey and Guernsey,\r\nand quite equal to that of the Devon. It churns easily, and the butter\r\ncompletely separates from the buttermilk, rendering a second churning\r\nof no avail. Three hundred pounds per cow a year of high-colored\r\nand fine-flavored butter is a fair average for a herd. Few, even of\r\nselected herds, of other animals equal this. We are not aware of\r\nphenomenal milkers among the Holderness cattle, unless all can be\r\ncalled such, their chief characteristic being uniformity. They breed,\r\nit may be said, perfectly true to type, so that all are excellent.\r\nThe reason for this uniformity is plain, and is found in the origin\r\nof the breed in the closest possible inbreeding for thirty years.\r\nThey originated from a cow with calf which was bought by Mr. Truman\r\nA. Cole, of Solsville, N.Y., of a drover who had just purchased it at\r\nauction in Knoxboro, N.Y., where a herd of pure-bloods, because of\r\nthe death of the owner, had been sold under the auctioneer's hammer.\r\nThe cow dropped a bull calf, which was bred to its mother, then to\r\nboth mother and sister; and this system of close inbreeding, even sire\r\nto daughter, as well as brother to sister, has been continued down\r\nto the present time, or for thirty years, as before stated. This has\r\nfixed and intensified the qualities, and at the same time secured the\r\ngreatest possible uniformity and really established a breed, separate\r\nand distinct from all others. This is the way in which all the valuable\r\nbreeds have been established, and this is the first persistent and\r\nsuccessful effort at establishing a purely American breed that has ever\r\nbeen made. While carefully watching results and selecting for breeding\r\npurposes, Mr. Cole has steadily refused to be turned from his course,\r\nor to change his purpose of establishing a uniform butter breed, and of\r\ntesting the fallacy of the popular notion about the injurious effects\r\nof inbreeding. His thirty years of the closest inbreeding have shown\r\nno such disastrous effects, but, on the contrary, have produced only\r\ngood ones. There is no failure in form or constitution. The only marked\r\nexternal change, save in securing the greatest uniformity, has been in\r\nthe gradual change of color. The original animals were pale red and\r\nwhite, the white being along the back from the shoulders to the tail,\r\ndown the hind-quarters, and along the belly to the shoulders. This\r\ndistribution of the light and dark colors has remained essentially the\r\nsame, but the light red gradually turned to dark red, then to brindle\r\nand finally to black. The later bred animals are all black and white.\r\nBut the calves, when first dropped, are still red and white, the red\r\nchanging to black when the first coat of hair is shed. This is probably\r\none of the most remarkable cases of inbreeding on record, as the breed\r\nis also one of the most remarkable. All who have tried this stock are\r\nremarkably well pleased with it, and calves readily sell for $100\r\na head with a demand greater than the supply--and this without any\r\nnewspaper advertising. The breed is endorsed by Mr. Lewis F. Allen,\r\nformer editor of the Shorthorn Herd-Book, and author of a work on\r\ncattle that stands second to none as authority. This endorsement has\r\nappeared in print over Mr. Allen's signature, as have the favorable\r\nopinions of many other good judges. In the latest edition of his book\r\non the Cattle of America, he says:\r\n\r\n    \"I never saw a more uniform herd of cows, in their general\r\n    appearance and excellence, which latter quality they daily prove\r\n    in the milk they produce. * * Compared with ordinary dairy herds,\r\n    the uniformity in yield testifies to their purity of breeding and\r\n    management.\"\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: American Holderness Bull, LEWIS F. ALLEN, at 16 months.\r\n\r\n    Property of T.A. Cole, Solsville, N.Y.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: American Holderness Cow, ADELAIDE 17th.\r\n\r\n    Property of T.A. Cole, Solsville, N.Y.]\r\n\r\nCol. Weld, who saw these cattle on exhibition at the New York State\r\nFair, held at Utica in 1879, said of them, in the November number of\r\nthe _American Agriculturist_;\r\n\r\n    \"The cattle of this 'Cole-Holderness breed' are of good size\r\n    and fair form as beef animals. * * * They are deep-bodied, with\r\n    large udders and teats, with excellent escutcheons, great swollen\r\n    and tortuous milk-veins and skins as yellow as Guernsey's. The\r\n    interior of their ears was almost like orange-peel. The butter made\r\n    from their milk * * * showed admirable color and keeping qualities.\r\n    * * * Could we test the various breeds of cattle, with the view of\r\n    determining with accuracy which is the most profitable dairy cow\r\n    for all purposes--butter, cheese, veal, and ultimately beef--giving\r\n    to each its fair weight in the scale of excellence, I would not be\r\n    surprised if Mr. Cole's breed would win the distinction of being\r\n    the most useful of all.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nINBREEDING.\r\n\r\nA word here about inbreeding will not be out of place. It may be\r\ndisastrous, or it may be beneficial. So also may be crossing or\r\ngrading. The evil as well as the good qualities are developed and\r\nintensified. Like begets like. Couple animals having the same bad\r\npoints, and these points will be increased and strengthened. Couple\r\nthose with good points, and corresponding results follow--that is, the\r\ngood are increased and strengthened. But if one animal has one point\r\nto excess, so as to become a deformity, and the other is deformed by\r\nlack of this same point, it is both safe and advantageous to breed them\r\ntogether, as the result is likely to be a medium between the two. So,\r\nwhatever the manner of breeding--inbreeding, crossing or grading--the\r\ngood or evil results depend altogether on the characteristics of the\r\nanimals coupled. Inbreeding intensifies and fixes the qualities, be\r\nthey good or bad.\r\n\r\n\r\nSWISS.\r\n\r\nThere have been a few importations of Swiss cattle, which are\r\nshort-legged and strong-boned, and hence well adapted to hilly\r\nregions. Some of these have made splendid butter records--from 500 to\r\nover 700 pounds of butter in a year. We should have great hopes of them\r\nfor the mountainous sections of our country; but as yet importation\r\nand breeding of this stock is not extensive enough to permit of their\r\navailability to any considerable extent for dairy purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLLED.\r\n\r\nThe polled or hornless cattle are great favorites with some of the\r\nWestern people, and an effort is made to get up a boom on them. But\r\nthey not only lack in numbers, but in the essential quality of a large\r\nflow of milk, or of a very rich one. The best information we can get\r\ndoes not indicate usefulness for the dairy. Neither do they excel\r\nseveral of the other breeds for beef. Their chief recommend appears to\r\nbe their destitution of horns, which in our eye is far from a mark of\r\nbeauty. It gives them a sort of bald, unfinished look that is anything\r\nbut pleasing. We prefer, for looks, short, well-turned horns. But of\r\ncourse, without horns there is no hooking, but pushing is by no means\r\navoided. Besides, in some cases we have known a lack of horns to make\r\nit difficult to fasten the animals in stanchions or with ropes. This\r\nmay not be true of the cows; but we were cognizant of an instance on\r\nthe New York State Fair grounds where a polled bull was constantly\r\ngetting loose. His neck was so thick that he could slip his head\r\nthrough any place not tight enough to choke him. As to disposition, we\r\npresume the lack of horns would not make the bulls any more amiable.\r\nHowever, we have nothing to say against this kind of stock, and would\r\nadvise all who like them to keep them. If horns are objectionable, it\r\nis easy to prevent them from growing on any stock by removing the first\r\nappearance of them on the calf. This can be done without much pain to\r\nthe calf and without much trouble to one who knows how to do it. It, as\r\nwe understand, requires no great skill, and can hardly be said to come\r\nunder the head of cruelty to animals. It is nothing like as painful as\r\ncastration.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEREFORDS.\r\n\r\nThe Herefords are having quite a boom in the West, but it is not as\r\ndairy stock, but as superior for beef. We have seen no strong claims\r\nput in for them for dairy purposes. The few we have seen did not seem\r\nto indicate any great dairy qualities, nor have any of the numerous\r\nportraits we have seen published borne the marks of dairy stock. But\r\nthe claim of beef qualities we believe is well founded. Their great\r\nrivals in this line are the Shorthorns.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMON STOCK.\r\n\r\nWe have not mentioned the so-called \"Native\" stock as a dairy breed,\r\nbecause it is not a breed, but a mixture of breeds--crazy-quilt stock.\r\nWe would not be understood as considering it of no value for dairy\r\npurposes, for when carefully selected, a dairy herd of common stock\r\nmay be very valuable. Great milkers and great butter makers are not\r\nuncommon among them; but there is such a mixture of blood in their\r\nveins that there is no guarantee of their producing their like. They\r\noriginally sprang from the best animals that the early emigrants could\r\nselect to bring over with them from Europe. But they were subsequently\r\ncross-bred so promiscuously that no trace of the original blood\r\ncan be discovered with any certainty. They were also subjected to\r\ngreat exposure and hardship, with scanty food, which had a greatly\r\ndeteriorating tendency. But, perhaps worst of all, there was no careful\r\nselection of males for breeding purposes, nor any attempt at judicious\r\ncoupling for improvement, or for even the maintenance of the existing\r\nstatus. In short, the entire treatment and all the surroundings had a\r\ndeteriorating influence and a tendency to the production of scrubs. If\r\nwe were to take all the existing pure-blood stock and breed it together\r\npromiscuously, while at the same time subjecting it to harsh treatment\r\nand neglect, it would not require a very long period to reduce it to\r\nthe same mongrel and scrub condition in which we now find the common\r\nstock of the country. Yet some of our common stock make excellent\r\ncrosses, when pure-blood males are used. But no improvement or valuable\r\nresults could come from using common stock bulls on pure-blood or other\r\ncows. The male has the controlling influence, and to the constant use\r\nof pure-blood males must we look for the improvement of the common\r\nstock of the country and for the maintenance of the existing status\r\nof the pure-bloods; and not only must we use pure-blood males, but\r\nkeep up a constant and careful selection of the best. Neither should\r\nwe trust to cross-bred or grade bulls for breeding purposes; for the\r\nprogeny will inherit the traits of ancestors on one side or the other,\r\nand hence will lack in uniformity, both in appearance and in quality.\r\nWhen we use a grade bull, the result is just the opposite of what it\r\nis when we use a pure blood. With the latter, we get half-bloods, then\r\nquarter, then eighths, sixteenths, thirty-seconds, and so on, toward\r\npure blood; but with a half-blood grade bull, the first offspring from\r\ncommon stock has only one-fourth pure blood, the next cross has only\r\none-eighth, the third one-sixteenth pure blood, and so on--reducing\r\nthe purity in the same ratio as the use of pure blood improves it--if\r\nwe continue to breed from the grade male offspring. If we always use a\r\nhalf-blood male, there may be a slight improvement in the blood. But\r\nthe improvement is too slow and the benefit too uncertain to make the\r\nuse of a grade bull advisable when a pure blood can be had.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBREEDING DAIRY STOCK.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving briefly glanced at the characteristics of the different breeds,\r\nit will not be out of place to say a few words about breeding and\r\nrearing dairy stock. There are three things to be considered:\r\n\r\n  1. Selection.\r\n  2. Coupling.\r\n  3. Care.\r\n\r\n\r\nSELECTION.\r\n\r\nBy selection, we mean not only the selection of the breed adapted to\r\nthe line of dairying pursued, but the selection of the individual\r\nanimals to breed and rear animals from, and especially the bull to\r\nbe used on the herd. This male should have a good pedigree--that is,\r\nbe the lineal descendant of animals known to possess the qualities\r\ndesired in the future herd. This is all-important; for however\r\nwell-formed and comely he may be, he will transmit the qualities of\r\nhis ancestors as surely as like begets like. This fact can never be\r\nsafely ignored. Milk and butter qualities, in a dairy herd, must take\r\nprecedence over beauty of form, however desirable the latter may be.\r\nThe cows to rear stock from should be selected, as far as possible,\r\non the same principle. Pedigree is not of as much consequence in\r\na cow, so far as practical results are concerned, though it helps\r\ninsure certainly in the quality of the offspring when that of the\r\ncow, as well as of the bull, is right. But we may safely venture on\r\nraising the calves of a good milker, as the probabilities are that the\r\noffspring will inherit the qualities of the sire, while it may also\r\ninherit the qualities of the dam, though she be of the most mongrel\r\nor mixed blood. If there is failure, however, it need not go beyond\r\nthat one animal--unless an attempt is made to use a grade bull on a\r\nnondescript dam, in which case prepotency is weakened and mongrelism\r\nmay show in the offspring. But grade bulls should never be used when it\r\nis possible to have the use of the right kind of pure blood, which is\r\nalways stronger than mixed blood, and hence a pure blood sire is pretty\r\nsure to transmit the qualities of his herd and family, in a great\r\ndegree, even when coupled with a cow of uncertain blood. In breeding,\r\nthe one bull makes half the herd, and when used on common stock, the\r\noffspring will always be half-bloods the first generation. The second\r\ngeneration they become three-quarter bloods; the third seven eighths;\r\nthe fourth fifteen-sixteenth, and so on, constantly approaching,\r\nbut never reaching, purity. For all dairy purposes, however, they\r\nbecome practically as good as pure-bloods. But if the breeding is the\r\nother way--that is, if a scrub bull is used on pure-blood cows--the\r\ndegeneration to the scrub status is in precisely the same ratio that we\r\nhave just given for improvement when pure-blood males are constantly\r\nused. By using grade bulls, there is also a constant deterioration\r\nof blood, but not as rapid as when scrub bulls are used. The only\r\nsafety is in using pure blood males. With these well selected and all\r\nother conditions maintained, the status is certain to be preserved,\r\nif improvements, in consequence of better care and selection, are not\r\nsecured.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOUPLING.\r\n\r\nProper coupling, or rather the coupling of proper animals, has received\r\nlittle attention, and is now confined generally if not exclusively to\r\nprofessional breeders. But it is a subject to which the dairymen can\r\nas well as not pay attention with good results. By coupling proper\r\nanimals, we mean having regard to individual points and qualities,\r\nnever coupling those having the same defects, either in form or\r\nquality. For instance, to illustrate, a cow high on the rump may be\r\nsafely bred to a bull low on the rump, or _vice versa_, the result, in\r\nall probability, being an offspring with a level rump. This is breeding\r\ntogether opposite extremes, depending on the one to correct the other.\r\nBut if we breed two sloped rumps together, or two humped rumps,\r\nthe result would be to exaggerate and intensify or strengthen this\r\ndeformity in the offspring. So of quality or disposition. A nervous cow\r\nbred to a nervous or irritable bull, would be pretty sure to drop a\r\ncalf that would be more nervous than either sire or dam. But if one of\r\nthe parents is dull and sluggish and the other irritable and sensitive,\r\nthe offspring might be an improvement on both. Again, a cow lacking in\r\nthe quality of richness of milk, though giving a large flow, should\r\nnot be coupled with a bull descended from a family having the same\r\npeculiarity of large flow lacking in richness. But if there is richness\r\non one side and abundance on the other, the coupling of the two might\r\nreasonably be expected to result in improvement in the offspring,\r\nwhich might inherit both the large flow and the rich quality. Bad\r\npoints and qualities are inherited as well as good ones. Hence, the\r\nconstant aim and care must be to avoid developing what is objectionable\r\nas well as to develop what is desired. It must be constantly borne\r\nin mind that like begets like. All the trouble attending inbreeding,\r\ncrossing or grading comes from not properly regarding this fact. Where\r\ninbreeding is followed, the only disadvantage arises from the fact\r\nthat all the animals are likely to have the same defects of form,\r\nquality and constitution. But where these are all right, the advantage\r\nis that inbreeding fixes the features and qualities and secures the\r\nestablishment of them in a type or breed. But crossing or grading\r\nanimals having the same failing will prove just as disastrous as\r\nwould inbreeding. But crossing may be done in a way to develop good\r\nqualities, and these may afterward be fixed by careful selection and\r\ninbreeding of offspring. This subject of breeding is one of great\r\nimportance, and yet little understood. Many things pertaining to it are\r\nyet to be settled, though great progress has been made during the last\r\nfew years, and public attention is being drawn to it as it never was\r\nbefore. It will be found that man can become master of the situation,\r\nand may, by observing certain fundamental conditions and varying only\r\nthe details, breed domestic animals of almost any form, disposition,\r\nand quality, that he may desire.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARE AND KEEP.\r\n\r\nBetter care and keep, however, are the key notes to improvement.\r\nHigher conditions and better surroundings lead to improvements which\r\nmay be developed into fixed traits by proper selection and coupling,\r\nprovided the improved environment is maintained. The status can be\r\nmaintained only by maintaining the conditions. This is what we mean\r\nby care. Under this head, we include all that pertains to the health\r\nand comfort of the animal. Judicious care is of prime importance not\r\nonly in breeding but in securing the best results in dairy products.\r\nProper food and drink and enough of it, with shelter, kind treatment,\r\nregularity and the most thorough system, must be provided, or\r\ncorresponding failure, for any and all abuse, neglect or mistake, is\r\nsure to follow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEEDING STOCK.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe question of feeding stock is yearly rising into greater prominence\r\nand importance. Formerly, it was thought that anybody who could throw\r\nout coarse fodder and hay to cattle knew enough for all practical\r\npurposes about feeding, and that any sort of a shelter, or no shelter,\r\nif the animal survived, was sufficient. Better ideas are beginning to\r\nprevail. Few men now think they know all that can be learned about\r\nfeeding stock, and those who know the most are the most anxious\r\nto learn. A thorough knowledge of feeding requires a knowledge of\r\nphysiology and biology, with the chemical composition and nutritive\r\nqualities of the different kinds of food. Added to this must be the\r\npractical knowledge gained by observation of the effects of the\r\ndifferent foods on different animals under various conditions. And\r\nwhen all is known that can be, there will still be room left for the\r\nexercise of the best judgment of the feeder as to the conditions and\r\nrequirements of the animal fed, and as to the quality of the foods\r\navailable and the quantity and proportions of each.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARBONACEOUS AND NITROGENOUS FOODS.\r\n\r\nIt is pretty well known what the constituents of the animal organism\r\nare, and what elements of nutrition are required in the food for the\r\nsustenance of the animal. Of these primal elements--some twelve or\r\nfifteen in number--it is found that, practically, when foods combined\r\ncontain two of them in proper proportion, the rest are generally\r\npresent in sufficient quantity. These two are CARBON and\r\nNITROGEN, and the foods containing them in relatively large\r\nproportion are respectively called _carbonaceous_ and _nitrogenous_.\r\nAll foods contain these elements in greater or less proportion. The\r\nproper proportion for feeding is found to be about _one_ of nitrogen to\r\n_five_ or _six_ of carbon. If the temperature of the weather is low,\r\nthe proportion of carbon may be raised to eight, and even ten, where\r\nlittle exercise is had--as, for instance, milch cows standing in a cold\r\nstable. But, in hot weather, when cows are giving milk, the carbon may\r\nbe reduced to four and even three--that is, so that there shall be\r\none part of nitrogen to three or four parts of carbon. The carbon is\r\nheat and fat producing, and some class it as motor producing, but we\r\nthink this is a mistake, save so far as heat is essential to motion. We\r\nthink nitrogen is motor producing as well as muscle producing--or, in\r\nother words, that the element which produces the organs of motion also\r\nfills them with energy, for the exercise of which heat is essential. We\r\ncannot have motion, or even life, much below the normal temperature of\r\nabout 98 degrees Fahrenheit. At all events, it is found necessary to\r\nfeed nitrogenous food to all animals that are working hard, to supply\r\nthe waste of muscle--and we think also to replace the expended energy.\r\nDr. J. Milner Fothergill, in his work on the \"Maintenance of Health,\"\r\npublished by G.P. Putnam's Sons, says: \"The effect of the nitrogen\r\nupon the brain is to _evolve nerve force freely_, and this rules and\r\nregulates the actual force which takes its origin in the respiratory\r\nfoods consumed. These respiratory foods furnish the force itself, but\r\nthe nitrogenized foods furnish the manifesters of force.\" It appears to\r\nus that the nerve force, which he says is evolved, is all there is of\r\nit, save the requisite conditions afforded by heat. Dr. Houghton says:\r\n\"The hunted deer will outrun the leopard in a fair open chase, because\r\nthe force supplied to its muscles by vegetable food is capable of being\r\ngiven out continuously for a long period of time; but in a sudden\r\nrush at a near distance, the leopard will infallibly overtake the\r\ndeer, because its flesh food stores up in the blood a reserve of force\r\ncapable of being given out instantaneously in the form of exceedingly\r\nswift muscular action.\" Dr. Fothergill goes on to say: \"Nitrogen is\r\nthe essential factor in all explosive compounds, from gunpowder to\r\nnerve force. It endows the consumer of it with energy and enables him\r\nto discharge his force quickly and rapidly.\" Again, he says of the\r\nrace-horse: \"His food affects his speed and endurance, and without his\r\nnitrogenized food he would cut a poor figure at a race, because without\r\nit he could not discharge his force fast enough.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT IS CARBON?\r\n\r\nIt is pure in the diamond, nearly pure in coal, and is the principal\r\nconstituent of all woody fiber--also of oils, fat, starch, sugar,\r\netc. Nearly all the visible organic world is composed of carbon. It\r\nappears to be very plentiful, but of our atmosphere it composes only\r\nabout four-ten-thousandths, while oxygen, with which it unites to\r\nform carbonic acid gas for vegetation to feed on, composes one-fifth\r\nand nitrogen four-fifths. Really, we have little trouble in securing\r\ncarbonaceous foods. The only difficulty is to get them in a digestible\r\nform. Only what is soluble can be digested and assimilated by the\r\nanimal organism. Hence, great care must be taken to get food in a\r\nproper condition for animal nutrition.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT IS NITROGEN?\r\n\r\nIt is almost pure in the albumens; both vegetable and animal. It\r\nis nearly pure in the white of egg. Hence, nitrogenous foods are\r\nquite commonly called albuminoids. It exists abundantly in all the\r\nproteins--as cheese or caseine, fibrin or lean meat, albumen, etc.\r\nNitrogen, in its free state, appears to be an innocuous gas, diluting\r\nthe oxygen and preventing it from rapidly oxydizing or burning\r\nup everything. As before said, it constitutes four-fifths of our\r\natmosphere, but does not appear to be directly appropriated by either\r\nvegetables or animals. As food for either, it must be in combination\r\nwith other elements--especially carbon--and yet it is very difficult to\r\nmake it unite with other elements, and hard to maintain the union when\r\nit is once formed. Its disposition is to break these unions and seek\r\nan idle state of freedom. Hence it is that, when held in durance, its\r\nconstant tendency to free itself makes it the motor force in all animal\r\norganisms, and the terrible energy in all explosives. It is secured\r\nin the form of ammonia in rain, by a process called nitrification it\r\nunites with the soil, and it exists in all decayed animal and vegetable\r\nmatter in a form suitable for plant food. Men and animals get it by\r\neating vegetables or by eating one another. It is a very abundant and\r\nimportant element, yet very difficult to obtain in an available form\r\nfor plant and animal food. Fortunately, but comparatively little of it\r\nis needed.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPOUNDING RATIONS.\r\n\r\nBy referring to the feed tables furnished by the analysts of this\r\ncountry and Europe, the farmer can learn the constituents of foods.\r\nThen, knowing the ration required, he can take different foods and\r\ncompound in the right proportions aimed at in feeding, whether for\r\nwork, for growth, for fat, for bare maintenance, or for milk.

This\r\nis .71 lb. albuminoids more, and .22 lb. of carbohydrates less, with\r\n.13 lb. of fat more, than the standard. Then he takes the richest and\r\nbest meadow hay, of which 30 lbs. contains of organic substance 23.2\r\nlbs., having digestible--albuminoids 2.49 lbs., carbohydrates 12.75\r\nlbs., and fat 42 lb. This is almost exactly the feeding standard.\r\n\r\nAs will have been seen by what has preceded, the German standard ration\r\nfor a milch cow is 24 lbs. of dry organic substance, containing 2.50\r\nlbs. nitrogenous food, and 12.90 lbs. of carbonaceous food.

And it will always be\r\nfound to work well if corn meal is fed with clover hay. Corn ensilage\r\nwith clover hay will constitute a proper feed. To avoid waste, and\r\nsecure the best results, we must learn to balance the nitrogenous and\r\ncarbonaceous foods. Our greatest difficulty in feeding, as in manuring\r\nthe soil, is to secure enough of the nitrogenous elements. These are\r\nwhat we have mainly to look out for, the carbonaceous foods usually\r\nbeing over abundant.\r\n\r\nNot only must we proportion the elements of food properly, but we must\r\nprepare the food so that it will be in a proper condition. It may\r\ncontain all the elements, but in consequence of being in a bad or wrong\r\ncondition, the animal cannot digest it. There is plenty of carbon in\r\ncoal, but who would expect the animal stomach to digest it? So there is\r\nnitrogen in saltpeter and gun-cotton, but they are not in a suitable\r\ncondition or form for digestion, and hence have no food value. Most\r\nraw vegetables are indigestible in the human stomach, but cook them,\r\nand thus put them in a proper condition, and they become nutritious\r\nfoods.\r\n\r\nThere are few, if any, perfect foods. Every food needs to be\r\nsupplemented with something else. Hence it is that both men and animals\r\nwant variety. Summer pasture, composed of mixed grasses, makes the\r\nbest food for all kinds of stock. Meadow hay, cut at the right time\r\nand properly cured--provided there is a mixture of grasses--makes a\r\nproper food for winter; but even this needs to be accompanied by roots,\r\nensilage or something of a juicy nature, as a relish, if for nothing\r\nelse, and as an aid to digestion.\r\n\r\nIn a state of nature, roaming free, animals select and balance their\r\nrations according to the cravings of appetite. But when domesticated,\r\nthey have no such freedom of choice, except perhaps in a few of the\r\nsummer months. In winter, they must take what is given to them. It is\r\nour duty, therefore, to give their food a proper balance of elements as\r\nfar as possible; and in thus conforming to the laws of nature, we shall\r\nfind both the greatest economy and the greatest profit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHANDLING MILK.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a comparatively easy operation to milk, if one knows how. The\r\nprocess is about as simple as that of Columbus in making an egg stand\r\non end, but it requires skill, practice and a muscular hand to do it\r\nwell. Grasping the teat so as to fill it with milk, and then tighten\r\nthe thumb and fore finger so as to prevent a return of the milk to the\r\nudder as the rest of the fingers are gently but firmly closed, so as to\r\ngive a downward pressure and expel the milk, is not likely to be done\r\nby the novice the first time trying. But ordinarily, the performance\r\nof this operation is soon achieved by any one who wishes to learn,\r\nthough it is declared by some that they \"never could learn to milk.\"\r\nSubstitute \"would\" for \"could,\" and we think the truth is more nearly\r\napproximated. Still there is a great difference in milkers, as well as\r\nin cows, the man or woman with a good grip in the hand having decidedly\r\nthe advantage, both as regards ease and expedition--and it is quite\r\nimportant that the milk should all be quickly and continuously drawn\r\nfrom the cow after the milking is begun, and while the cow is in the\r\nmood of \"giving down.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nKEEP QUIET.\r\n\r\nIf a cow is suddenly disturbed, so as to get excited, or gets tired\r\nand out of patience, the flow of milk may be prematurely stopped. If\r\nthis disturbance is continued from time to time, the effect will be\r\nto permanently lessen the flow, or \"dry up\" the cow. Anything that\r\nirritates a cow, while being milked, reduces both quality and quantity.\r\nHence, milking should be done in a quiet and orderly manner. Treat the\r\ncow very kindly and gently, so as to gain her confidence, and be as\r\ncareful as possible not to hurt her teats by unnecessarily tearing open\r\nany cracks there may be, or pinching any warts, and be sure to not dig\r\nyour finger-nails into the teats.\r\n\r\n\r\nREGULARITY.\r\n\r\nIt is a good plan to milk cows regularly in the same order, taking the\r\nsame one first, and winding up with the same one every time. Regularity\r\nof hour in commencing the milking of the herd is an advantage, in\r\nsecuring the best results, since animals as well as men are greatly the\r\ncreatures of habit, and when the time comes around the cow will desire\r\nto be milked and all the functions of her system will concur in this\r\ndesire.\r\n\r\n\r\nKEEP DOWN THE FOUL ODORS.\r\n\r\nThe milking should be done in a sweet, clean place--either a stable\r\nkept scrupulously clean, and plaster or other deoderizer freely used,\r\nor in a row of stanchions in an open shed, with barely a roof to keep\r\noff storm and sunshine, and no filthy deposits allowed to accumulate\r\naround it. The milk, as fast as drawn, should be removed from the\r\nplace of milking, lest it absorb odors from the droppings, the breath,\r\nor the exhalations from the cow's body--or even from the sweat and\r\ngrime of the person and clothes of the milker--for milk is extremely\r\nsensitive to these influences. It is much more so than is popularly\r\nsupposed, and should be put in a sweet atmosphere as soon as possible\r\nwhen drawn. Fine fancy goods, with the most delicious and delicate\r\nflavor, cannot be made from milk that has been exposed to the influence\r\nof a foul atmosphere.\r\n\r\n\r\nKEEP OUT THE DIRT.\r\n\r\nSo, also, great care should be taken to keep out all hairs, dirt and\r\nfilth of every kind. If permitted to get into the milk, filth cannot\r\nbe entirely strained out, and hence some of its odors and flavors will\r\nlinger in the fats of the milk and appear in the product manufactured\r\nfrom it. The indispensable necessity for clean utensils has already\r\nbeen mentioned. Filth from this source will not only affect odor and\r\nflavor, but is quite likely to contain the germs of ferment which will\r\nmultiply in the milk and product, and cause disastrous results. With a\r\nclean can, clean pails and clean hands, begin the task of milking by\r\nbrushing off all loose materials from the cow's side that may rattle\r\ndown into the pail, carefully brush and clean the udder and teats, and\r\nthen place the pail between your knees in a way to prevent the cow\r\nputting her foot into it, or upsetting it, if she should move about\r\nnervously, or be suddenly startled--which should not be permitted if it\r\nis possible to avoid it.\r\n\r\n\r\nLET OUT THE COWS.\r\n\r\nAs fast as milked, it is best to let the cows go. This gives more room,\r\nreduces the generation of heat in the stable or milking place, and\r\nlessens the amount of droppings and consequent bad odors rising from\r\nthem. Those left will soon understand this and not get uneasy.\r\n\r\n\r\nA LICK OF MEAL.\r\n\r\nIf the cows have been prepared for milking by giving them a lick of\r\nmeal, or a little dry hay, when they come into the stable, it will\r\nbe found to have a good effect. It will also cultivate a willingness\r\nto come home at milking time and take their respective places in the\r\nstanchions. It pays to please and satisfy a cow. She will deposit her\r\nappreciation in the pail.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARE OF MILK.\r\n\r\nWhen the milking is over, the milk should be taken as directly to the\r\nplace of manufacture as possible. If it must be kept over night, see\r\nthat it is well stirred and properly cooled to 70 degrees Fahrenheit,\r\nbefore leaving it. Do not put on a close cover, unless the milk\r\nis thoroughly cooled. It is far better to deliver it directly to\r\nthe cheese or butter maker, who knows how to care for it, and has\r\nfacilities for doing the work--or, at least, ought to have. Very much\r\ndepends on having the milk delivered in good condition. If it is not,\r\nno after care and skill can make a perfect product from it. True, if\r\nall right when delivered, it may be afterward injured or spoiled, but\r\nit is not likely to be. It is therefore the duty of the patron to do\r\nhis part of the work all right; then he may with some reason blame\r\nthe operator if the result is not right. But butter and cheese makers\r\nare too often expected to turn out first-class products from second\r\nor third class milk--a task impossible to perform. With good milk and\r\nproper facilities, there is no valid excuse for failure.\r\n\r\nThe first object is the production of good milk. This is of prime\r\nimportance. Without it, the after product must of necessity be\r\ninferior. The next object is to preserve the milk in its best\r\ncondition, all through the handling, in order to reach the best\r\nresults. Milk is often spoiled in the handling. Hence care and judgment\r\nmust be exercised to maintain the proper conditions to the end.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPOSITION OF MILK.\r\n\r\nFew understand the delicate and complex nature of milk. It is a\r\ncompound of many ingredients; and if any one of these is disturbed, it\r\naffects the whole. Their union is very weak and unstable, and liable to\r\nbe broken by many influences. To give a clearer idea of the composition\r\nof milk, we copy the following diagram, prepared by Dr. E. Lewis\r\nSturtevant, Director of the New York Agricultural Experiment Station:\r\n\r\n                                       MILK.\r\n                                         |\r\n                       +-----------------+--------------+\r\n                     Cream.

Their combination is effected through the organism of the\r\ncow, the ultimate work being performed by the udder, where it is no\r\nsooner completed than reaction begins and change is the result.\r\n\r\n\r\nDETERIORATION OF MILK IN THE UDDER.\r\n\r\nThe longer the milk remains in the udder, the more it is impoverished\r\nby absorption of some of its ingredients. This is specially true of\r\nthe fats, which are taken up by the absorbent vessels of the udder\r\nand carried into general circulation. For this reason, the first milk\r\ndrawn--which is the first secreted, and therefore remains in the udder\r\nthe longest--is the poorest milk drawn, and that which is last secreted\r\nand last milked (the strippings) is the richest. Hence, the longer the\r\ninterval between milkings, the poorer the milk for butter making. Three\r\nmilkings a day will give better results than two.\r\n\r\n\r\nDO FATS EXPAND BEFORE CONGEALING?\r\n\r\nIf milk is to be set for cream, the sooner it is put to rest and the\r\nless heat it looses before setting, the better for the separation of\r\nthe cream. If cooled down much, the cream will rise more slowly and\r\nseparate more imperfectly. In cooling, the fluids and semi-fluids\r\ncondense faster than the fats, and hence become relatively heavier, and\r\nsettle as the fat globules rise, by virtue of the law of gravitation.\r\nThe theory has been broached by Mr. H.B. Gurler, of DeKalb, Illinois,\r\nthat in sudden cooling, the fluids and semi-fluids are not only\r\ncondensed, but the fats expanded, thus increasing the difference in\r\nspecific gravity in both directions. In this way, the rapid rising of\r\ncream in sudden cooling he thinks may be better accounted for. His\r\nidea is based on the fact that water, just before congealing, begins\r\nto expand and continues to expand as the temperature lowers. Fats\r\nconsolidate at a much higher temperature than water, and he thinks the\r\nsame law of expansion may intervene in both cases. So far as we are\r\naware, it is not known whether fats do actually expand before and after\r\nreaching the point of congelation or not, and we shall feel an interest\r\nin having the question positively settled by the scientists. If it is a\r\nfact, it introduces a new element into our philosophy, and will help in\r\nthe solution of some points not yet satisfactorily determined.\r\n\r\n\r\nEFFECTS OF FALLING TEMPERATURE.\r\n\r\nIt is a fact that cream rises best in a falling temperature, very\r\nslowly in a stationary one, and little or none in a rising temperature.\r\nHence, in cold weather, when milk cools very rapidly after being drawn\r\nfrom the cow, it is the practice of many good dairymen to raise the\r\ntemperature of the milk to 100 degrees when set. In this way, they get\r\na quicker and more complete separation of the cream as the milk cools\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nIt would be a good idea to have, in all butter factories, apparatus\r\nfor setting milk so constructed that the temperature of the mass\r\nof milk can be gradually and evenly raised to 100 degrees, or even\r\nslightly above; for it is difficult to deliver warm milk in a good\r\ncondition especially in hot weather--if it has to be carried any\r\nconsiderable distance, while in cold weather, it is sure to get\r\nconsiderably reduced in temperature, both in milking and on the road to\r\nthe factory. Hence, it seems almost absolutely essential, if the best\r\nresults are to be attained, to have some means of properly raising the\r\ntemperature of the milk at the factory.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOOLING AND AIRING.\r\n\r\nIf milk is to be sent to the factory, for either butter or cheese\r\nmaking, where the distance is half a mile or more, it should be aired\r\nand cooled--especially if it is to be shut up in a tight can. This\r\ncooling should be done as speedily as possible after milking, to avoid\r\ntaint or souring. If the milk is kept over night, such airing and\r\ncooling are absolutely indispensable. The mode of doing this must vary\r\nwith conditions and circumstances; but, whatever method may be adopted,\r\nwe would by no means recommend putting ice directly into the milk. The\r\neffect cannot be to improve flavor or keeping quality.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROTECTION FROM THE HOT SUN.\r\n\r\nBy no means should the can of milk be exposed to the direct rays of\r\na hot sun, either on the platform waiting for the delivery wagon, or\r\non the wagon. Give it shelter and shade of some kind, in both cases.\r\nIf a woolen blanket is wet in cold water and wrapped around the can,\r\nthe rapid evaporation from the blanket will keep down the temperature.\r\nEverything that can be should be done to preserve milk in its normal\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATMENT OF NIGHT'S AND MORNING'S MILK.\r\n\r\nThe night's milk and the morning's milk should never be mixed before\r\nstarting for the factory, but kept in separate cans and so delivered.\r\nThe effect of mixing will be seen soon enough at the factory, and\r\noften much too soon in hot weather. If the morning's milk were made\r\nas cool as the night's, the effect of mixing would not be so speedy\r\nand disastrous. But it appears to be an immutable law, that reducing\r\nthe temperature and then raising it hastens decomposition. A low\r\ntemperature only retards decomposition; it does not prevent it, unless\r\nvery low and it is continued. As soon as the temperature is raised,\r\ndecomposition sets in with accelerated rapidity, as if to make up for\r\nlost time. Hence, we have always looked upon low temperatures in the\r\ndairy as objectionable. As low as 60 degrees but not below 50 degrees\r\nis the limit which we prefer. We think this range more effective\r\nfor long keeping than a lower one. Certainly, dairy goods made and\r\nkept within this range will not go to decay so soon as in a higher\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECEIVING.\r\n\r\nIn receiving either milk or cream from the patron, it is essential\r\nnot only that justice be done in the weight or measure, but that the\r\npatron should be satisfied of this fact. The agent sent out to gather\r\ncream should be an honest man, in whom the patrons as well as the\r\nemployer have confidence, and should understand his business and do\r\nit in a workman-like manner, so as to inspire confidence. He should\r\nalso be versed in the various tricks that may be resorted to by\r\npatrons to deceive and cheat, and be on his guard, quick to discern any\r\nsuspicious surroundings or indications. As much depends on his judgment\r\nand observation as on his honesty--especially if any of the patrons\r\nare disposed to be dishonest, as is sometimes the case where it would\r\ngenerally be least suspected. The later device of not only measuring\r\ncream by the gauge, but of testing its yield of butter by churning a\r\nsample, is not only a guard, to considerable extent, against fraud, but\r\nmore closely approximates justice by getting at the actual quality of\r\nthe cream, on which depends its value. There is no associated system\r\nyet devised--save that of churning every patron's cream separately and\r\nweighing the product--that secures exact justice to all. Nature does\r\nnot appear to have furnished standards of commercial measure or value\r\nfor the purpose of indicating mine and thine in mixed transactions, or\r\nin speculative exchange. We have only relative and approximate guides,\r\nby which justice, in a business sense, is by no means secured.\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTING.\r\n\r\nWhere milk is delivered at the factory, we have as yet no standard\r\ntest of value. All the receiver can do is to see that it is in a\r\nnormal condition--neither sour nor tainted, nor containing bad odors.\r\nFor this purpose, the smell must mainly be relied on. Hence, healthy\r\nand keen olfactories are a great aid here, as in some other cases. If\r\none catches the fumes when the can cover is first removed, or as the\r\nmilk runs into the weighing can, he is pretty sure to detect any very\r\npositive bad odor. The eye, to one of experience, is almost certain to\r\ndetect any great variation. Even slight watering is seen by some from\r\nthe peculiarity of the reflection of light from the surface--especially\r\nwhen in motion. Much water shows from the \"thin\" appearance of the\r\nfluid. Where the smell or appearance are cause for suspicion, or there\r\nis any other cause, a sample may be saved and such tests as are at\r\nhand may be applied. The so-called lactometer will show whether the\r\nspecific gravity is below or above the normal standard. The cream gauge\r\nwill give the percent of cream at a given temperature. If, afterward,\r\na sample right from the herd, taken so as to know that it has not been\r\ntampered with, shows better quality by these two tests, it is pretty\r\nconclusive evidence that the milk from which the factory sample was\r\ntaken was not in a normal condition. If the herd has been subject to\r\nno change of feed or conditions between the times of taking the two\r\nsamples, any jury would be safe in bringing in a verdict against the\r\ndefendant for watering, skimming, or otherwise tampering with his milk,\r\nas the facts in evidence might indicate.\r\n\r\n\r\nBAD MILK.\r\n\r\nSour or tainted milk, to any perceptible degree, ought not to be\r\nreceived at the factory. One such mess will injure, if it does not\r\nspoil, a whole batch. The sour milk is likely to lead to a sour, leaky\r\nbatch, and the tainted milk to huffy if not floating curd, and porous,\r\nquickly off-flavor and decaying cheese. We have little patience with\r\nthose who deliver such milk, and none with those who attempt to devise\r\nmeans to work it into palatable cheese and thus to get it into the\r\nunsuspecting stomachs of the consumers. It is too much like making\r\nomelets of rotten eggs. This is especially the case with tainted\r\nmilk. The first stages of souring are not so objectionable, so far as\r\nwholesomeness is concerned. Sour milk may make good pot-cheese to which\r\nwe do not object, but it will not make good American cheddar cheese. To\r\nattempt to work it into this is the worst use it can be put to.\r\n\r\n\r\nWEIGHING.\r\n\r\nAll possible precautions should be taken to avoid mistakes in weighing\r\nand giving credit. A hasty comparison of each mess with that of the\r\nprevious one delivered by the same man will indicate any marked\r\ndeparture from weight and serve as a check against error. It is well\r\nto always announce the weight to the patron, who then has a chance\r\nfor comparison with his average or previous messes. He will be pretty\r\nlikely to mention any marked variation, especially if it is against\r\nhim. Some patrons like to have a pass-book, in which the weight of\r\neach mess is entered. This is a little trouble to the receiver when\r\nin a hurry, but it is a complete check against errors of entry on the\r\nfactory book, and against the forgetfulness of the patron, who may get\r\nthe impression that he has delivered more milk in a given time than\r\nhe has been credited with. Everything that guards against error or\r\nmisunderstanding will be found to pay and give satisfaction to honest\r\nmen. An honest factoryman not only wants to be right, but to appear\r\nright and have the confidence of his patrons. A dishonest one will want\r\nto appear right, and it is well to take such precautions as will make\r\nhim what he appears. See that the weighing can is properly balanced,\r\nthat the scales are true, and that the weights are correct. An honest\r\nman will bear watching, and it is absolutely necessary to watch a\r\nrogue. Where the milk is sold to the factory, of course all interest in\r\nthe matter with the patron ends when he gets his milk correctly weighed\r\nand his money for it. Where the _pro rata_ system is carried out, this\r\ninterest extends to the weighing of the cheese, its marketing and the\r\ndivision of the proceeds.\r\n\r\n\r\nKEEPING MILK.\r\n\r\nWhen the milk is in the cheese vat, it should be stirred and aired\r\nat night until the temperature is down to 70 degrees, if it is to\r\nstand quiet; if an agitator is used, which is preferable, no further\r\nattention need be paid to the milk but to see that the supply of\r\ncold water is ample and continuous. As to mixing the morning's with\r\nthe night's milk, it appears to be preferable to working up the two\r\nmilkings separately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBUTTER MAKING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere really are but four systems of setting milk for cream,\r\nnotwithstanding the numerous inventions and devices. These are: 1.\r\nCooling in water; 2. cooling in air; 3. shallow setting; 4. deep\r\nsetting.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEEP SETTING AND WATER COOLING.\r\n\r\nDeep setting, whether in pails or pans, is always accompanied with\r\nwater and the use of ice. In many instances, however, where running\r\nwater is abundant, ice is dispensed with, and the pails are set in\r\npools or tanks, while the pans have water run around them, if not\r\nunder them. Under-cooling, however, is pretty well understood to be\r\na disadvantage, unless the vessel containing the milk is submerged\r\nin water or nearly so. Ice is a good deal used, and the milk rapidly\r\nrun down in temperature. Some think this is the better as well as\r\nthe quicker way, if not the only way to get all the cream. Our only\r\nobjection to this rapid cooling is that it runs the temperature too\r\nlow, and, in our opinion, injures the keeping quality of the product.\r\n\r\n\r\nEFFECT OF TOO LOW COOLING.\r\n\r\nIf run below 40 degrees, or the point where water begins to expand, all\r\ncooling below that point lessens the difference in specific gravity\r\nbetween the water and the fat globules, and operates diametrically in\r\nthe opposite direction to what is desired. The aim is to condense the\r\nwater, which is a good conductor, and leave the fat globules, which are\r\npoor conductors, unchanged or but slightly contracted. In this way,\r\nthe heavier fluid settles and drives the light particles of fat upward\r\nto rest on the surface. But, if we go below 40 degrees, we produce\r\nthe directly opposite effect and retard the rising of the cream. For\r\nquality, we prefer the slower cooling in water, and think the longer\r\ntime given will secure all the cream available and in a purer condition.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUTTERMILK FLAVOR.\r\n\r\nIf more cream or butter is obtained by rapid cooling, we think it is\r\nbecause more particles of caseine are entangled in the cream and remain\r\nin the butter when churned. This would of course make more weight for\r\nmarket, but of inferior quality and sooner to go off flavor. But where\r\nthe butter is consumed fresh from the churn, this does not matter\r\nso much; and if the particles of caseine give the butter a slight\r\nbuttermilk flavor, it pleases some palates that have been educated\r\nto like it. We, however, prefer the sweet, delicate flavor of cream\r\nbutter, free from caseine or lactic acid. But, if one has a special\r\nline of customers, he must please them, whatever the demand may be. If\r\nthe butter is thrown on the general market, and there is liable to be\r\ndelay in getting it into consumption, it cannot be made too pure, nor\r\nretain its rosy flavor too long.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHALLOW SETTING AND AIR COOLING.\r\n\r\nGenerally, in shallow setting, whether in large or small pans, cooling\r\nthe milk in air is depended upon. Formerly, an underground room, or\r\none in a shady place, was the only appliance usually resorted to for\r\ncooling. But, of late years, some method of artificially cooling the\r\nair by the use of ice is generally adopted. In some cases, the milk\r\nroom is made small, with low ceiling and double walls, so that a cake\r\nof ice near the ceiling does the cooling. Usually, however, some sort\r\nof refrigerator construction is resorted to, so that cool air from the\r\nice-house, or ice placed above the milk room, is introduced to regulate\r\nthe temperature and keep it steady. We prefer cooling in air, though\r\nit may take a little more space and time. By this method, extremely\r\nrapid cooling and low temperature are avoided, and no violence is done\r\nto the milk or cream. Deep setting, it is true, exposes less surface\r\nto the air; but if the milk is not submerged, the surface is likely to\r\nbe cooler than the air above, and to condense the vapor in it, which\r\nfalls with all its impurities on the surface of the cream. Any foulness\r\nor bad odors are thus absorbed and go into the butter product. While\r\nsubmerging obviates this objection and keeps out all impurities from\r\nthe air, it also prevents all escape of bad odors by evaporation.\r\nWhatever that is objectionable may be in the milk is retained there. By\r\nsetting in open air, which should of course always be pure and sweet,\r\nthe air, being cooled down and used as a medium for cooling the milk,\r\ntakes up the exhalations of moisture and odor from the milk, and thus\r\npurifies it. The colder medium is always the condenser and absorbent,\r\nand it is only when the milk gets colder than the air above it that it\r\ncondenses the moisture in the air and absorbs its odor. This will never\r\noccur where cold air is the cooling medium. The milk theoretically can\r\nnever get cooler than the air, while practically it remains a degree or\r\ntwo warmer than the air.\r\n\r\n\r\nOXYDIZING CREAM.\r\n\r\nThere is another advantage in using the air as a cooling medium. In\r\nshallow setting, more surface is exposed and the air, coming in contact\r\nwith the surface, imparts to it a portion of its oxygen, which mingles\r\nwith the oils and develops that fine butter flavor so much relished by\r\nmost and which is a peculiarity of fine butter. Again, slow cooling\r\ngives more time for this oxydation to go on, and thus \"ripen\" the cream\r\nfor churning without souring it. This leaves all the fine flavor in\r\nit, unmixed with flavors resulting from acidification. But, where milk\r\nis set deep for creaming--and especially where there is no exposure to\r\nthe air, as is the case in submerging--no butter flavor is developed,\r\nand the cream has to be kept until sour before it is properly\r\noxydized. There is not a full development of butter flavor proper, but\r\ndevelopment of flavor resulting from the mingling of lactic acid with\r\nthe oils. But without this exposure and acidification, the butter is\r\ninsipid and comparatively flavorless. Any subsequent exposure to the\r\nair soon throws the butter off flavor, the oxygen mingling with the\r\nfats alone while the cream is rising and still sweet. This development\r\nof flavor by oxydation is not mere theory; it has been scientifically\r\ndemonstrated at Cornell University, New York, if not elsewhere, and\r\nmust sooner or later be generally accepted and butter making proceed on\r\na more rational and certain basis. But it is hard work to get people\r\nout of old ruts, or to overcome fixed habits and prejudices. Really\r\nscientific butter making, in which every step will be thoroughly\r\nunderstood and deliberately taken, is a thing of the future. It will\r\ncome in time, and then our descendants will wonder why we were so\r\nstupid and slow as not to see and adopt the simplest principles when\r\nthey were thrust into our very faces. But mind and judgment are matters\r\nof growth, the same as everything else in this universe of being.\r\n\r\n\r\nSKIMMING MILK.\r\n\r\nSo many improvements or inventions have been introduced in the\r\nsetting of milk for cream that the term \"skimming\" has become almost\r\na misnomer. In both deep and shallow setting, arrangements have been\r\nmade in several of the patent pans and cans for drawing out the milk\r\nfrom the bottom and leaving the cream. Glass gauges are set in the\r\nvessels so that the exact depth of the cream can be seen, and the milk\r\ndrawn down close to the cream or a small amount of the upper portion\r\nof the milk left with the cream. In skimming with a skimmer or dipper,\r\nmany aim to take the upper portion of the milk, on the theory that\r\nthe separation is less perfect toward the top than it is lower down.\r\nEspecially may this be done where a dipper or skimmer without holes is\r\nused. It is claimed by some careful experimenters and close observers\r\nthat this adds to the quantity of butter yielded without deteriorating\r\nthe quality.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN TO SKIM.\r\n\r\nWhether skimming off the cream or drawing off the milk be practiced,\r\nthe question arises as to the proper time for performing the operation.\r\nThe more general practice is to \"skim\" just as the milk gives\r\nunmistakable signs of acidity, or thickens a very little on the bottom\r\nof the pan or can. A few prefer to skim the cream sweet, and still\r\nanother few let the milk lopper. This wide divergence of opinion and\r\npractice shows how very imperfectly is the real philosophy of butter\r\nmaking understood; but, notwithstanding this, each one is usually very\r\ntenacious in his belief as to the superiority of his own practice. A\r\nfew fancy butter makers say that the finest butter is made from sweet\r\ncream, raised in cold air by shallow setting. It is insisted by them\r\nthat airing and oxydizing, and not souring, is what \"ripens\" cream and\r\nfits it for easy churning, while this airing and oxydizing imparts\r\nthe fine aroma so much desired in the finest butter. This view of\r\nthe origin or development of flavor is sustained by experiments made\r\nat Cornell University, at the suggestion or under the supervision of\r\nProf. L.B. Arnold. It is also claimed that the lack of flavor and the\r\nshort-keeping of sweet-cream butter churned from cream raised by deep\r\nsetting is due to its lack of oxygen, and that souring the cream thus\r\nraised, before churning, both oxydizes it and imparts a ranker and\r\nmore positive flavor resulting from the effects of the lactic acid. We\r\nthink both propositions look reasonable, and we should like to see a\r\nseries of scientific experiments made to determine both the effects of\r\noxygen and the effects of lactic acid on the butter product of cream.\r\nAt present, theory and practice vary so widely with different butter\r\nmakers who turn out a high-priced butter for the market, that one is\r\nled to doubt all theories and query whether the quality of butter does\r\nnot depend on something not yet known, which is independent of all\r\ncurrent theories and practices.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHURNING.\r\n\r\nAnd as to the proper time of churning, there is an equal divergence\r\nof opinion and practice. One churns his cream sweet, another wants it\r\nslightly changed, a third wants positive acidity in the cream, and\r\na fourth loppers the cream, while a fifth lets the cream stand even\r\ntwelve hours after loppering--and this extremely sour cream butter\r\nsells for the very highest market price. So we are left all at sea,\r\nso far as acidity is an element in butter making. Again, to further\r\nillustrate these extremes, while a gentleman in Vermont is setting his\r\nneighbors agog by raising cream in a vacuum, a Canada gentleman is\r\nexperimenting with an invention to raise cream by hydrostatic pressure\r\nand get the fat of the milk so pure as to dispense with churning. We\r\nhope both will succeed.\r\n\r\n\r\nTEMPERATURES.\r\n\r\nThere is not so wide a difference in opinion and practice as regards\r\nthe temperature at which churning should be done in order to secure\r\nthe best results; yet there is quite a wide range--from 55 degrees to\r\n65 degrees--or 10 degrees Fahrenheit. But only a few go as high as 65\r\ndegrees or as low as 55 degrees. The great majority favor 60 degrees\r\nto 63 degrees as the proper range of temperature for different seasons\r\nand conditions. Some favor 58 degrees to 60 degrees, and all appear\r\nsatisfied with results. It is not improbable that different degrees\r\nof acidity in the cream require different degrees of temperature\r\nfor churning, and that sweet cream requires still another variation\r\nof temperature. So the breed, condition of the cows, kind of feed,\r\nquality of feed, character of the water drank, length of time the\r\ncows have been in milk, and other considerations, require variations\r\nin the temperature. Sure we are that the difference in conditions and\r\nsurroundings must explain some of the differences of opinions and\r\npractices among butter makers.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT MAKES THE BUTTER COME.\r\n\r\nIt is not known whether concussion or friction, or both, cause the\r\nseparation of the butter from the buttermilk in churning. But we\r\nsuspect that concussion is the real agent that produces the separation,\r\nas we have really seen no churn that did not in some way produce more\r\nor less concussion. All the churns we have seen used appeared to\r\nproduce good results, and we find every dairyman is satisfied with\r\nthe work of the churn he uses, whatever the kind, style or patent. We\r\ncannot, therefore, recommend any style of churn as superior to another,\r\nbut we prefer the simple and less expensive forms, as not only costing\r\nless but being easier to keep clean.\r\n\r\nThe churning should be steady and not violent. A too rapid or sudden\r\nseparation of the butter from the buttermilk is not desirable. It is\r\nno recommend for a churn that it churns quick. Such a churn is apt to\r\ninjure the so-called grain of the butter and make it salvy and greasy.\r\nThe least churning that will separate the butter from the buttermilk is\r\nthe best.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN TO STOP CHURNING.\r\n\r\nThe improved modern method, now in practice by the best butter makers\r\ngenerally, is to stop the churn as soon as the butter is collected in\r\nparticles the size of wheat kernels. Just before this, when the first\r\nsigns of the separation of the butter is seen, the sides of the churn\r\nare washed down with cold water--usually below 60 degrees, or about 55\r\ndegrees--to not only prevent waste, but to harden the butter and make\r\nit easier to handle. When the granules are the size of wheat kernels,\r\nthe butter is drawn off or the butter taken out of the buttermilk, as\r\nthe case may be. If the butter is left in the churn, water is poured\r\nin to float the butter, which is then gently agitated a moment and\r\nthe water drawn off. This operation is repeated until the water runs\r\nclear. Sometimes one of the washings is in brine, which coagulates the\r\ncaseine into a soluble form and prepares it to be washed out afterward.\r\nIn this way, it is believed that purer, longer-keeping butter can be\r\nmade. In some cases, however, butter makers have customers who want a\r\nbuttermilk flavor in their butter. They, therefore, do not wash the\r\nbutter, or wash it very little. Such butter must be consumed at once,\r\nas it will not keep.\r\n\r\n\r\nWORKING.\r\n\r\nBy this method of retaining the butter in a granulated form, only\r\nsufficient working is required to evenly work in the salt. The less\r\nworking the better.\r\n\r\n\r\nSALTING.\r\n\r\nThe salt, after the butter is properly drained, can be carefully mixed\r\nwith the butter by stirring. When thoroughly incorporated, barely\r\npressing the butter together into a solid mass is all that is needed.\r\nIf one does not want butter very salty to the taste, it can be evenly\r\nand nicely salted by completely wetting it with saturated brine, then\r\ncarefully pressing the granulated butter together and leaving in it as\r\nmuch of the strong brine as will remain. We have seen butter salted in\r\nthis way, and it was very evenly and completely salted, having in it no\r\nundissolved grains of salt, but it was not as salt to the taste as some\r\nlike.\r\n\r\nAbout an ounce to the pound is good salting; but more or less salt must\r\nbe used to suit the taste of customers. None but refined salt should be\r\nput into butter. No salt is better for this purpose than the Onondaga\r\nF.F., which is American, and the cheapest salt fit for dairy use that\r\ncan be obtained.\r\n\r\nThe principal office of the salt in butter is to impart an agreeable\r\nflavor, in conjunction with the natural aroma of fine butter; but it\r\nis a fact that too much salt injures good flavor, and it may, to\r\nsome extent, be used to cover up or neutralize bad flavors. We do not\r\nrecommend its use for this latter purpose, preferring that the natural\r\nflavor of butter from pure cream should be preserved.\r\n\r\n\r\nSALT AS A PRESERVATIVE.\r\n\r\nSalt does very little to preserve butter. It retards the decomposition\r\nof the caseous and albuminous materials left in it; but if butter is\r\nproperly made of cream not mixed with loppered milk and is completely\r\nwashed with pure water, it is a fair question if butter will not keep\r\nlonger without salt than with it. There are instances on record where\r\nbutter has been kept sweet without salt for a long time. We half\r\nsuspect that, though salt at first retards decomposition, the salt\r\nitself, in time, decomposes and becomes sodium and chlorine gas, or\r\nenters into new combinations with the constituents of the butter, and\r\nthus makes new compounds that do not in the least improve the flavor.\r\nWe have no positive evidence of this, but have had this suspicion\r\nawakened by facts related about the keeping of butter and by a process\r\nof general reasoning. It is true that salt is one of the most stable\r\ncompounds known, but we have proof that it can be resolved into its\r\noriginal elements, when stronger affinities are presented for one or\r\nboth of them to unite with. It would not, therefore, be strange if such\r\ndecomposition sometimes follows when used in our food preparations.\r\n\r\n\r\nPACKING BUTTER.\r\n\r\nIt is quite a knack to properly pack butter in large packages, and\r\nthe work needs to be carefully done. Some use it too violently, by\r\npounding it down, and thus making the butter greasy or oily. It should\r\nbe gently pressed together in the package in such a way as to leave\r\nno spaces filled with air, for the air will surely mingle with the\r\nsurrounding butter and injure its flavor. A good way is to begin the\r\npressure at the center and work carefully toward the circumference, so\r\nthat all air may escape at the sides. In this way, perfect solidity of\r\nthe mass is secured, and it is left in the best condition for keeping,\r\nso far as the packing is concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\nPREPARING THE PACKAGE.\r\n\r\nBefore putting the butter in the package, the package should be soaked\r\nin water, so as to remove the taste of the wood, and then thoroughly\r\nsoaked in saturated brine, so that the wood will not draw the salt from\r\nthe butter which comes in contact with it. If it does, the butter thus\r\ndeprived of salt will turn white, have a sickish flavor, and soon turn\r\nrancid. It is a good idea to not only sprinkle a thin layer of salt\r\nover the bottom of the package, but to rub the moist inner sides with\r\ndairy salt, and thus make sure that there is salt enough in contact\r\nwith the wood to prevent its absorbing the salt from the butter.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLOSING THE PACKAGE.\r\n\r\nWhen a package is filled, a piece of thin muslin, cut so as to just fit\r\ninto the top of the package and completely cover the butter, should be\r\nwet in cold water and carefully placed over the top, having the edges\r\npressed down close to the sides of the tub. Then the cloth should be\r\ncompletely covered with a thin layer of salt; and if the salt is\r\nmoistened, so as to form of it a thick paste that will become air-tight\r\nwhen it dries, it will do much to keep the top of the butter clean and\r\nsweet--for the more nearly air tight the package is when completed the\r\nbetter it is for the preservation of the butter. Then put on the cover,\r\nand seal the whole as tightly as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTORING.\r\n\r\nRemove the package to a cool, sweet place, not above the temperature of\r\n60 degrees, and set it so that it will absorb no moisture or odors from\r\nthe ground. Much butter is spoiled by keeping, because of neglecting\r\nthe temperature, and setting the bottom of the package directly on the\r\ncellar bottom. If kept at a temperature above 60 degrees, butter will\r\nsurely go off flavor, and wood will as surely draw moisture from the\r\nground, if in contact with it, and become sour and musty, sooner or\r\nlater affecting the flavor of the butter within the package. Nothing is\r\nto be lost, but all to be gained, by paying attention to these little\r\nthings.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTYLE OF PACKAGE.\r\n\r\nOf course, where a maker has a special market for his butter, he will\r\nput it up in such style and form of package as suits his customers.\r\nHe needs no other guide and would injure his business if he followed\r\none. But, for general market purposes, the 50 lb. tub is the best form.\r\nThe New York and Boston dealers like this because it is convenient\r\nfor the retailer, who can readily slip the tub off from the butter\r\nfor either weighing or cutting up for his customers. But aside from\r\nthese considerations, the Welsh tub is a very bad form of package for\r\nkeeping butter, as it is by no means air-tight nor anything approaching\r\nit. Hence, butter sent to market in these tubs must soon be sold and go\r\ninto consumption, or there is material depreciation in quality and a\r\ncorresponding loss in price. The old-fashioned firkin, which could be\r\nheaded up and the butter covered with brine, is a much better package\r\nfor keeping butter. But, where butter is consumed as fast as it is\r\nmade, and fresh winter made butter supplies the demand through the cold\r\nseason, the keeping of butter for any considerable length of time is\r\nnot of so much consideration. We think it fortunate that this is so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEESE MAKING.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo much has been written and said, and so little understood, about\r\ncheese making, that it seems almost a hopeless task, as well as a\r\nthankless one, to attempt to say anything more on the subject. Sour\r\nignoramuses and floating charlatans have spoiled more curds than have\r\nbeen spoiled by any defect in the milk. Sour, whey-soaked cheese has\r\nbeen the rage, and it is generally supposed that acid alone makes a\r\nfirm cheese, when the experience of every cheese maker is that it is\r\nvery difficult, by the ordinary processes, to make a firm curd out of\r\nsour milk--which, of course, no one ought to be asked to make into\r\ncheese--unless it be pot-cheese. Acid may make a curd solid, but not\r\nuntil it has cut out a large share of the goodness of the curd, and the\r\ncheese resulting will be about as digestible as so much putty.\r\n\r\n\r\nDUTY OF PATRONS.\r\n\r\nIt is the duty of every patron of a cheese factory to send good milk to\r\nit, and to send the milk in good condition. It is not only his duty,\r\nbut his interest to do this. A bad mess of milk may spoil a whole\r\nvat-full. This not only entails loss on his neighbor, where the factory\r\nis run on the _pro rata_ plan, but the patron must stand his share of\r\nthe loss. Aside from the loss entailed on others and himself, he ought\r\nto be ashamed to deliver milk in a bad condition. There is no valid\r\nexcuse for it. It ought to be his pride to deliver milk in as good\r\ncondition as anybody does. If he cannot, he should leave the business,\r\nand go into something in which he has the ability to excel. Care and\r\ncleanliness, if the cows are healthy and have proper food, will insure\r\ngood milk always.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNREASONABLE EXPECTATION.\r\n\r\nIt is unreasonable to expect a cheese maker to turn a prime article of\r\ncheese out of poor milk. If one carries shoddy cloth to the tailor,\r\nhe expects a shoddy suit in return, not a broadcloth one. So, if he\r\ncarries bad milk to the factory, he must expect bad cheese. If he takes\r\nsour apples to the cider mill, he does not expect sweet-flavored cider,\r\nbut sour. So, if he carries sour milk to the cheese factory, he must\r\nexpect sour cheese. These defects, when they exist in a small degree,\r\nmay be overcome, or nearly so, and a passable cheese made. But, is\r\nthe cheese made from imperfect milk really a fit article of food? Who\r\nwould work rotten eggs into custard, or sour meal into bread? Yet this\r\nis just as consistent as working sour or tainted milk into cheese, and\r\nthe product is just as wholesome. That which makes stinking eggs makes\r\nstinking milk--decayed albumen--which is just as wholesome in the one\r\nas in the other.\r\n\r\n\r\nGUARANTEES.\r\n\r\nThe cheese maker who guarantees his cheese is very foolish if he does\r\nnot insist on a guarantee of good milk, nor should he be compelled\r\nto rely on his judgment formed in the haste of receiving the milk. A\r\ntricky man may juggle a bad mess of milk on to the best expert. How\r\ncan the cheese maker tell whether the milk is from a gargetty udder,\r\nor the first milk after calving--both of which may develop in a very\r\noffensive way when the milk is heated up? So the milk may be so nearly\r\ntainted or so nearly sour that it will not stand the process of heating\r\nup and cooking. The law ought to be very severe on the man who delivers\r\nbad milk at a factory, or sells it to anyone. The factoryman who pays\r\nthe price of good milk for sour or tainted milk is certainly very\r\nshort-sighted, and cannot long maintain the respect of the man who\r\nsells it to him, nor sustain himself pecuniarily. The man who pays\r\ncash for milk has the right, above all others, to demand that the milk\r\nshall be sweet and wholesome. This is one point that should be insisted\r\nupon--the delivery of good milk in good condition.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEATING.\r\n\r\nAfter the milk is all in, or the requisite amount is in the vat, the\r\nheat may at once be started and raised to some point between 80 and 86\r\ndegrees. If we set below this, the rennet works too slow; if we set\r\nabove, it is thought to work too fast--so custom has fixed upon this\r\nrange of temperature for setting, and there appears to be no valid\r\nobjection to it. But while the temperature of the milk is being raised,\r\nand before, it should receive frequent stirrings to keep the cream\r\nfrom rising, and thus becoming partially or wholly wasted. The rennet\r\nshould by no means be added until the temperature stops rising--or so\r\nnearly so that by the time the rennet is stirred in and the stirring\r\nstopped, because the milk begins to coagulate, a stationary temperature\r\nwill have been reached.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLORING.\r\n\r\nThe coloring fluid should be added just before the rennet is--unless\r\nwhite cheese is made. There is a limited demand for white cheese for\r\nthe London market. But do not make the color too high--as there is a\r\nlimited demand for high-colored goods, and this mainly from the South,\r\nin spring and fall. Nor should the color be too pale, as there is\r\nreally no demand for pale cheese. It should be either white or of a\r\nmedium hue--a bright, golden yellow. There is a demand for uniformity\r\nof color, as buyers often want large lots, all of the same hue or\r\nshade. In selecting such a lot, they may rule out first-class cheese\r\nthat is too pale or too high-colored. The universal use of the same\r\nmanufacture of coloring extract guaranteed of uniform strength, might\r\nsecure uniformity in coloring. But this is doubtful and difficult.\r\nA better, and we think, a feasible way, would be to have a standard\r\ncolor--like those accompanying paints--furnished to every cheese maker\r\nas a guide, and let him color to it as nearly as possible. In this\r\nway, a close approximate to uniformity of color might be secured. He\r\ncould then use whatever coloring fluid he chose, and his eye would be\r\nhis guide. Coloring does not improve the product. If it does no harm,\r\nit does no good beyond gratifying the eye and deceiving the palate\r\nthrough the common notion that high color and high flavor go together.\r\n\r\n\r\nSETTING.\r\n\r\nTheoretically, 98 degrees or blood heat would seem to be the\r\ntemperature for setting, as rennet is the most active at this point.\r\nUsually, 82 degrees in warm weather, and 86 degrees in cool weather,\r\nare the points at which the rennet is added in setting. But there is no\r\nreason for a different temperature at different seasons, except that\r\nin cool weather the temperature is liable to run down a little--which\r\nshould not and would not be the case, if the make room were so\r\nconstructed that the temperature could be controlled and kept at summer\r\nheat.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER DETAILS.\r\n\r\nEnough rennet should be added, as a rule, to cause thickening of the\r\nmilk to begin in 20 minutes, at 82 degrees. More or less rennet may be\r\nused, as it is designed to have cheese cure more or less rapidly. As a\r\nrule, the more rennet is used, the lower should be the temperature at\r\nwhich the milk is set and the curd worked. Agitation of the milk should\r\nbe kept up for at least 15 minutes, where coagulation begins in 20\r\nminutes, or as long as it can be and not prevent a solid coagulation.\r\nThe stirring after the rennet is incorporated is merely to keep the\r\ncream from rising. The less cream gets to the surface, the less waste\r\nthere will be. In a cool room, where the surface cools quickly and\r\nthere is a falling of the temperature of the milk, there will be a thin\r\ncream on the surface. This will form a soft cream curd, which will\r\nadhere to the sides of the vat, to the rake, and to the hands, and be\r\nquite annoying. The amount is trifling, but the annoyance of the thing\r\nis enough of itself to make it desirable to keep the cream down; and a\r\nsummer temperature of the room is useful for this purpose, aside from\r\nthe comfort and the better handling of the curd, from first to last.\r\n\r\n\r\nKEEP THE TEMPERATURE EVEN.\r\n\r\nAfter the milk begins to thicken, a cloth should be thrown over the\r\nvat to keep the surface warm. A convenient way is to tack a cloth to\r\nslats a little longer than the vat is wide, putting the slats a foot or\r\neighteen inches apart. This is easily rolled up and set aside, when not\r\nwanted, and is easily unrolled over the vat when needed. There should\r\nbe no raising of the temperature after the rennet is added and the mass\r\ncomes to a standstill. If there is, the portion next to the sides and\r\nin the bottom of the vat will get the most heat, and there the rennet\r\nwill work the fastest and the curd will become tough before it is firm\r\nenough on the surface. Therefore, let the heat be stationary after the\r\nrennet is added and until the curd is cut fine, and keep the heat as\r\neven as possible all this time.\r\n\r\n\r\nCUTTING.\r\n\r\nThe coagulum should be cut as soon as it will break clean across the\r\nfinger when placed in it and lifted gently upward. This early cutting\r\nis essential. There is seldom, if ever, any waste from cutting a curd\r\ntoo soon. The clearest whey will always be obtained by cutting early.\r\nThe whey exudes from the curd much more freely when it is yet young and\r\ntender--and the only object in cutting the curd at all is to get out\r\nthe whey. When cutting is begun, let it be continued as expeditiously\r\nas possible until it is finished. Do not stop and let the curd stand\r\nand toughen. It cuts more easily, with less friction and less waste by\r\nloosening fine particles of curd, when it is tender and parts easily\r\nbefore the knife. The more it toughens, the harder it cuts, the more\r\nfriction there is, the more the curd is torn and bruised, and the more\r\nthe waste. If we could cut early and cut instantaneously, it would be\r\nall the better.\r\n\r\n\r\nCUT FINE.\r\n\r\nCut the curd very fine. Seldom, if ever, is a curd cut too fine. As\r\nthe object is to get rid of the whey, the finer it is cut, the more\r\neasily we achieve our object. It is not as far from the center of a\r\nsmall piece of curd for the whey to run out as it is from the center\r\nof a large piece. By cutting fine, we expose more surface for the whey\r\nto run out of, and we have smaller pieces to heat up. Curd is a bad\r\nconductor of heat. If the pieces are large, it takes a long time for\r\nthe heat to slowly penetrate them when we want to increase it. The\r\nsmall pieces, therefore, absorb the heat more evenly, and this gives an\r\nevener action of the rennet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"COOKING.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the cutting is done, if the whey is separating rapidly, the heat\r\nmay be started at once. If the action of the rennet is rather slow,\r\nit is better to wait a few minutes for the curd to harden a little,\r\nwhile with your hand you carefully rub down the side of the vat, thus\r\nremoving all the curd that may be adhering to it. Not over five minutes\r\nwaiting, as a usual thing, is necessary, and generally there need be\r\nno waiting. But as soon as the heat is started, begin to gently stir\r\nthe curd with a rake, by passing it down into the middle of the vat\r\nand gently raising the curd on each side. If uncut pieces appear,\r\ncarefully separate them with the teeth of the rake. Keep up this\r\nstirring, which may be more violent after the curd hardens, until the\r\nwhole is heated up to 98 or 100 degrees--or to blood heat. The reason\r\nfor constant agitation is to keep an even temperature throughout the\r\nmass and prevent the curd from packing. This secures even action of\r\nthe rennet. The reason for going to blood heat is because rennet is\r\nmost active at this point. It is the temperature indicated by Nature.\r\nIt is the one at which we digest our food, and the one at which the\r\ncalf's stomach forms curd and afterwards digests it. The pepsin or\r\ngastric juice is more potent at blood heat, and this pepsin or rennet\r\nis what does the work. The heat does not cook the curd in the vat any\r\nmore than it cooks the milk in the cow's udder. We choose 98 degrees\r\nas the proper temperature because the digestive or cheesing process of\r\nthe rennet goes on faster at this point. To go above or below it is to\r\nlose instead of gain. This temperature should therefore be maintained\r\nuntil the curd is \"cooked\"--that is, until the action of the rennet has\r\nexpelled the proper amount of whey and the curd is as firm as we want\r\nit. Anent the stirring of curds, use the hands as little as possible.\r\nThere is nothing better for this purpose than the common hay rake with\r\nthe handle shortened and one tooth cut off from each end by severing\r\nthe rake-head within three quarters of an inch of the next tooth.\r\n\r\n\r\nDRAWING THE WHEY.\r\n\r\nWe next draw the whey down to the curd--leaving enough to stir it in\r\neasily, and cool the whole mass down to 90 degrees, to avoid too much\r\npacking, and draw off the balance of the whey. The whey should be run\r\noff before the acid develops, because acid, formed from the milk in\r\nthe sugar, dissolves the minerals and cuts some of the oils in the\r\ncurd, and these run off in the whey. Many curds, by remaining in the\r\nwhey too long, become whey-soaked, and make cheese that is soggy and\r\nhard, with a sour flavor. This kind of firmness is not desirable,\r\nnotwithstanding it is called for by buyers, who seldom know anything\r\nabout cheese making. If the acid develops before the whey is properly\r\nexpelled, or the curd is \"cooked,\" it carries off the minerals, which\r\nare in the form of phosphates, and this makes the cheese poor indeed.\r\nThese phosphates are of lime, iron, magnesium, etc., but the principal\r\nis phosphate of lime. The affinity of these minerals for lactic acid\r\nis stronger than for phosphoric acid; so they let go of the latter\r\nand unite with the lactic acid, forming lactates and leaving the\r\nphosphoric acid free. But if we get all of the whey out of the curd\r\nthat we desire, and then get the curd out of the whey--that is, draw\r\noff the whey--before the acid comes on, we retain the phosphates and\r\nfats in the cheese--all the goodness that belongs in it. The acid will\r\ncome on afterward, but we have reduced the sugar to a minimum, and the\r\namount of acid developed does no serious injury. As the whey is already\r\nexpelled, of course it cannot wash out the minerals that are dissolved.\r\nThese remain, and in the process of curing recombine with the\r\nphosphoric acid. We have left in the curd about 3-1/2 parts of the 87\r\nparts in 100 parts of milk. The whey left in the curd contains, we will\r\nsay, 1-10th of the sugar that was in the milk. The acid formed from\r\nthis, though too small to do any known injury, is large enough to do\r\nall the good required, if it does any good at all. We are, therefore,\r\nsafe when we get the whey out of the curd and the curd out of the whey\r\nbefore the development of the lactic acid.\r\n\r\n\r\nSALTING.\r\n\r\nWhen the whey is well out of the curd, so as not to waste the salt,\r\nthe salt may be applied and stirred in. The salt does not stop the\r\ndevelopment of acid, as is popularly supposed. When applied, it aids\r\nin keeping the curd loose. Then the curd may stand, with occasional\r\nstirring, almost any length of time for the purpose of airing and\r\ncooling, of getting rid of any bad odors, of developing flavor by\r\noxydation from contact with the atmosphere, and of letting the acid\r\ncome on. It is safest not to put the curd to press until it has a\r\npositively clean sour smell. This shows that certain chemical changes\r\nhave taken place, freeing the curd of the gases generated by this\r\nprocess, and prevents any huffing of the cheese on the shelf in the\r\ncuring room. Where cheddaring and grinding are practiced, the salt is\r\nof course applied after the curd is ground. Cheddaring is the easier\r\nand safer method, as the whey can be drawn early, and there is no\r\ndanger from the acid. Salting at the rate of 2-1/2 lbs. of salt to\r\n1,000 lbs. of milk is the usual practice and not far from right. For\r\nlong keeping, 3 lbs. of salt are not too much. Use none but the best\r\ndairy salt--the best of all the dairy salts, as well as the cheapest,\r\nbeing the Onondaga, F.F.\r\n\r\n\r\nPUTTING TO PRESS.\r\n\r\nAfter the acid fermentation is properly progressed, the curd should be\r\nput to press at a temperature not much below 80 degrees, nor much above\r\n85. If higher, it is liable to heat and taint the cheese at the center;\r\nif lower it is difficult to face the cheese and press the curd together\r\nproperly. But in warm weather, there is not much danger of getting the\r\ncurd too cool.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACID IN CHEESE MAKING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis has been written on so much that the subject has become hackneyed.\r\nThe acid seems to have eaten into the souls of some and turned them\r\nsour; but notwithstanding, the so-called \"sweet curd\" idea has made\r\nsteady progress. Much of the opposition has come from buyers for\r\nexport, who do not appear to be able to distinguish between a firm\r\ncheese and a hard cheese, and who ignore quality if they get a cheese\r\nhard enough to ship, without danger of breaking, by the time it is ten\r\ndays old. This has been demonstrated by the fact that cheese condemned\r\nwhen green as too soft has been pronounced by the same buyers fine and\r\nall right, even endorsed with enthusiasm, when it was two or three\r\nmonths old, which is about as young as a first-class cheese should be\r\nshipped.\r\n\r\n\r\nANALYSIS OF MILK.\r\n\r\nOf course, there would be no acid in milk if there were no sugar in\r\nit. The proportion of sugar is shown by the following analysis of an\r\naverage sample of good milk made by Dr. Voelcker, the late chemist of\r\nthe Royal Agricultural Society of Great Britain:\r\n\r\n  Water                                     87.30\r\n  Butter                                     3.75\r\n  Caseine                                    3.31\r\n  Milk-sugar and extractive matter           4.86\r\n  Mineral matter (ash)                       0.78\r\n                                           ------\r\n           Total                           100.00\r\n\r\nIt will be seen by this that the per cent. of sugar is at least 4.50,\r\nif we deduct the extractive matter, the proportion of which is not\r\ngiven. Numerous German analyses show it to range from 3.50 to 5.75\r\nper cent. Henry and Chevalier put the average at 4.77, and Prof. L.B.\r\nArnold says milk from cows in perfect health should contain, during the\r\nmonth of August, 4.30 to 5.50 per cent. We will call it 4.50 per cent.\r\nThere is 87.30 per cent of water.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT THE CHEESE MAKER DOES.\r\n\r\nIn separating the solids from the liquids, by the action of rennet, at\r\nthe proper temperature, we expel, say 83.30 parts of the water, leaving\r\n4 parts. We get rid of, say 4.20 parts of the sugar, which is held in\r\nperfect solution in the water. We lose, say .50 of one part of butter,\r\n.31 of one part of the caseine or albuminoids, and .13 of one part of\r\nash. This leaves--\r\n\r\n  Water                                          4.00\r\n  Butter                                         3.25\r\n  Caseine                                        3.00\r\n  Sugar                                           .30\r\n  Ash                                             .65\r\n                                                -----\r\n           Total                                11.20\r\n\r\nWe thus have 11.20 per cent. of the 100 parts out of which to get our\r\ncured cheese. A fair average is 10 lbs. of cheese for 100 pounds of\r\nmilk. Some of the water evaporates in curing, say 1 part, leaving 3\r\nparts. Our 10.20 parts of cheese is then composed of the following:\r\n\r\n  Water                                          3.00\r\n  Butter                                         3.25\r\n  Caseine                                        3.00\r\n  Sugar, or what results from decomposition       .30\r\n  Ash                                             .65\r\n                                                -----\r\n  Total                                         10.20\r\n\r\nThis is a little in excess of the general yield. The waste is usually\r\nin the greater amount of ash, sometimes nearly the whole of it, when\r\nthe acid develops before the whey is expelled. In that case, the lactic\r\nacid dissolves the phosphates and they run out with the whey. This\r\nis so much loss of ingredients absolutely essential to digestion and\r\nassimilation.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT OUGHT TO BE.\r\n\r\nSo far from this, there ought to be less loss of ingredients than\r\nwe have supposed in our illustrative figures. But more of the butter\r\nis cut and runs off with the whey when the acid is developed before\r\ndrawing the whey. The aim of the \"sweet curd\" system is to avoid this\r\nwaste as much as possible, especially that of the butter and ash. To\r\neffect this, the whey is drawn sweet and the acid allowed to develop\r\nafter the curd is cooked and the whey expelled. There need be no\r\nmore water left in the curd, but more butter and ash, both of which\r\ntend to make the cheese softer. But with proper curing rooms, there\r\nis no trouble in making the cheese firm enough for all practical\r\npurposes, including shipping. It is better to use less rennet and\r\nnot have coagulation begin under 25 minutes, cutting the curd about\r\n15 or 20 minutes later, and to take more time for curing, at a lower\r\ntemperature. We then have a firmer, more buttery, and better flavored\r\ncheese, which is a desideratum. But, with high and changing temperature\r\nin the curing room, no certain or satisfactory results can be counted\r\non.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEORY AND PRACTICE.\r\n\r\nIn theory, we ought to prevent the waste of butter and caseous matter\r\naltogether; but in practice, there is always a little loss of butter,\r\nand there are certain albuminous ingredients, called by the Germans\r\n_ziega_, which rennet will not coagulate. There is, of course, no\r\nmeans of saving this. The sugar we cannot and do not want to save in\r\nthe cheese. If retained, it would be injurious and probably spoil the\r\ncheese, as the lactic acid in the small amount of sugar retained in\r\nthe water is all that we can well manage. But all matter coagulable by\r\nrennet, all the butter, and all the ash, we ought to retain; and we\r\ncannot really call ourselves scientific cheese makers until we can do\r\nthis. When accomplished, a greater weight of cheese will be the result.\r\n\r\nThere is no avoiding the acid resulting from the small amount of\r\nsugar retained in the curd; but, having expelled sufficient whey, if\r\nwe keep the curd warm enough, and hold it in the vat or the sink long\r\nenough, the lactic acid will come on and we shall get rid of the bad\r\nresults of putting a curd to press sweet. This acidity is absolutely\r\nnecessary with the generality of curing rooms. But with low and steady\r\ntemperature in the curing room, we can do about as we please.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRENNET.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur recent observations more than ever convince us of the importance of\r\ngood rennet in cheese making. Great evils and losses result from the\r\nuse of bad rennet; and the great trouble is that many cheese makers do\r\nnot know when rennet is bad. There is not only the evil of diseased and\r\ntainted rennets, to begin with, but the preparation from good rennets\r\nis often spoiled in the preparing. Frequently, in hot weather, they are\r\nallowed to taint while soaking; and when the liquid is prepared sweet,\r\nit is often allowed to ferment and taint for want of sufficient salt\r\nand from exposure in a high temperature.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOAKING IN WHEY.\r\n\r\nSoaking in whey, containing all its taints and impurities, is the\r\nsource of a vast amount of foul rennet and off-flavored cheese. If whey\r\nis used, it should be boiled to kill taints and precipitate, as far as\r\npossible, the solids remaining in it. But, do the best that can be done\r\nwith it, and still whey is objectionable for soaking rennets, because\r\nof the acid that develops in it from the presence of sugar. This acid\r\nneutralizes a corresponding amount of rennet and helps to impoverish\r\nthe cheese. Indeed, if carried far enough before the curd is removed\r\nfrom it, the finer flavoring oils are cut by it, the phosphates are\r\ndissolved, and these pass out with the whey, leaving the cheese but\r\nlittle better than an indigestible mass. If the acid adds solidity to\r\nthe cheese, it does it by removing from it valuable ingredients.\r\n\r\n\r\nTAINTED RENNET.\r\n\r\nFrequently, we have encountered rennet preparations that were not only\r\nvery sour, but also tainted and having a strong smell of carrion.\r\nNothing but huffy, porous, stinking and rotten cheese can result from\r\nthe use of such rennet preparation. Yet it is used, and the result\r\nis attributed to bad milk, or to the presence of some inscrutable\r\ntaint or ferment, so prone are mankind to attribute effects to wrong\r\ncauses. It has been to us unaccountable that cheese makers should use\r\nsuch horrid broth as we have seen them use, if they have any sense of\r\nsmell whatever, and utterly astonishing that they should expect good\r\ncheese to be made from using it. With good milk, the cheese may appear\r\nfairly good for several days--especially if put to curing at a low\r\ntemperature. But sooner or later, the taint must make its appearance.\r\nPossibly, it may not show ten days from the hoops, but the cheese can\r\nnever become a mellow mass without also becoming a stinking one. It\r\nwill soon be ripe and soon rotten.\r\n\r\n\r\nCURING RENNETS.\r\n\r\nIt is usually understood that rennets are calves' stomachs salted and\r\ndried, or otherwise prepared; but it is not so certain that all the\r\nrennets in market are of this kind. The stomachs of the young of all\r\nmilk-eating animals may be used for curding milk. We are not so sure\r\nbut that among \"Bavarian\" rennets we get the stomachs of the young\r\nof every animal known under the sun. They are of all sizes and all\r\ndegrees of strength, but are generally liked by those who use them.\r\nThey are cured by tying the two ends, and blowing the rennets up, like\r\nbladders. A better way, we think, is to rub them well with pure dairy\r\nsalt, stretch them on a hoop or crotched stick, and hang them in a cool\r\ndry place. Some simply fill them with salt, tie them, and hang them up\r\nto dry. A great objection to this is, that the salt is likely to draw\r\nmoisture from the atmosphere, and in wet weather the rennets are liable\r\nto drip and thus lose strength. Salting rennets down in a barrel, as we\r\ndo meat, is considered objectionable--for what reason, we know not. The\r\nwriter had excellent \"luck,\" one season, with rennets preserved in this\r\nway. In whatever way preserved, rennets should, by all means, be kept\r\ncool. Heat is found to be very injurious, while cold--even freezing\r\nand thawing--appears advantageous. Possibly because the freezing and\r\nthawing loosen the fiber and set the rennet spores free.\r\n\r\n\r\nAGE AN ADVANTAGE.\r\n\r\nNo rennets less than a year old should be used, if it can possibly be\r\navoided. The old rennets, other things being equal, are stronger and\r\nmake a firmer curd than new ones. Any one who has experimented with\r\nboth will always aim to have a supply of good old rennets on hand.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAVING RENNETS.\r\n\r\nIn saving rennets, great care should be taken to have them right.\r\nThe fourth stomach of the calf is what is saved. Cut it from the\r\nadjoining stomach, at the point of junction, and do not leave a piece\r\nof intestine on the other end, but cut close to the opening of the\r\nrennet. Remove straws and dirt of all kinds carefully, but be sure to\r\nnot rub off the delicate lining of the stomach, which is the digestive\r\nor coagulative part and very much inclined to adhere to your hands,\r\nespecially if they are dry. Do not try to rinse off anything more\r\nthan the loose dirt, and that without rubbing, for you cannot rub\r\nwithout waste. What is better, avoid having dirt or any thing else in\r\nthe stomach to remove. This you can do by letting the calf go sixteen\r\nor eighteen hours without eating, and placed where it can get hold\r\nof nothing to swallow before killing. Say, feed it at night and slay\r\nit the next day about noon. The stomach will then be empty and clean\r\nand well stored with pepsin for the digestion of the next meal. This\r\nsecretion, is just what you want. The rennet is best when the calf\r\nis six or eight days old. But, in any case, digestion should be well\r\nestablished before killing. If the calf should go too long without\r\nfood--as is often the case with veal calves--the stomach will get\r\ninflamed. This is objectionable.\r\n\r\n\r\nSELECTING RENNETS.\r\n\r\nIn selecting rennets to soak, all discolored and bad smelling ones\r\nshould be scrupulously rejected. But rubbing rennets is a disagreeable\r\nand disgusting business, and it is somewhat difficult to keep your\r\nrennet of uniform strength. Therefore, if good rennet extract can be\r\nbought at a reasonable price, we would recommend its use. It ought to\r\nbe made better and cheaper in a wholesale way than in little batches\r\nat each factory. To guard against imposition, one should buy only of\r\nknown reputable dealers. Preparing your own rennet is much like doing\r\nyour own shoe making. It doesn't pay, if you have got anything else\r\nremunerative to do.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHOLESALE PREPARATION.\r\n\r\nIf one must prepare his own rennet, the better way is to do it in a\r\nlump before the cheese-making season begins. Get a strong barrel and a\r\npounder--such as used by washerwomen; also a wringer. Take old rennets\r\nand cut them into strips. Make a weak brine of pure water, by using\r\none pound of salt to twenty pounds of water, and in this, soak, pound\r\nand wring your rennets. Hang them up and freeze them; then soak, pound\r\nand wring them again; and so on as long as you can get any strength.\r\nWhen done, carefully settle, skim, and strain your liquid. Put it in a\r\nclean barrel or stone jars, put in all the salt that it will dissolve,\r\nso that a little will settle on the bottom, then stop or cover tight;\r\nput in a cool place and take from it as wanted for use. There is\r\nnothing better than saturated brine for keeping animal products. Be\r\nsure, however, that you use only the purest dairy salt in preparing\r\nbrine. Some say that only stone jars should be used for keeping rennet.\r\nWe have used an ash tub for the amount prepared weekly. To keep the\r\nwood from tainting, we invariably, every time we dipped out rennet and\r\nexposed new surface, rubbed it with salt.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXCLUDING AIR.\r\n\r\nRennet could be much more easily kept sweet if put in an air-tight\r\nvessel. The \"American Dispensatory\" says: \"When gastric juice is\r\ncompletely protected from the air it may be kept unchanged for a\r\nlongtime; but on exposure it speedily undergoes decomposition,\r\nacquires a very offensive odor, and loses its characteristic digestive\r\nproperty.\" We think that the Dispensatory is right. The composition of\r\npure gastric juice is as follows: Water, 97.00; salts, 1.75; pepsin,\r\n1.25; total, 100.00. There is also a small amount of free acid. Both\r\nrennet extract and pepsin are used as medicine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCURING ROOMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is hard to determine which is of the greater importance, good\r\nrennet or properly constructed curing-rooms; for both are necessary\r\nto the production of the best cheese, while the want of either is\r\nsure to injure if not to spoil it. The importance of controlling the\r\ntemperature in curing has not yet taken hold of the popular mind. The\r\nbest milk in the world may be spoiled by bad rennet, and the best curd\r\nin the world may be spoiled by a bad curing-room.\r\n\r\n\r\nTEMPERATURE.\r\n\r\nIn a large majority of the curing-rooms of the country, the temperature\r\nranges from 60 degrees Fahrenheit to 90 degrees and even above.\r\nSometimes these extremes are realized within a few days. Think of\r\nsetting a curd to fermenting at 80 to 90 degrees, when it ought to\r\nstart at 60 to 65 degrees! Yet, this is frequently done; and to prevent\r\nthe cheese from huffing and crawling it is proposed by some to make\r\nthe curd so dry and sour in the beginning that heat will not soften\r\nit. In this way, is made what some buyers style a \"firm\" cheese. The\r\nbest English Cheddars, according to the American Encyclopedia, are set\r\nto curing at a temperature of 60 degrees, and are never allowed to go\r\nabove 70 degrees. Our observation and experience are that the range of\r\ntemperature should never go above 75 degrees. Curing should begin as\r\nlow as 65 degrees, and no cheese should be marketed under thirty days\r\nfrom the hoops. When the curing is slow, as it ought to be, the cheese\r\nwill not be ripe in less than that time. If sixty days old before\r\nready for market, the better. The hurrying process is everywhere bad\r\nfor the product, and no amount of souring helps the matter, however\r\nhard it may make the cheese and however well it may stand up in hot\r\nweather. We want something else besides standing-up quality. With a\r\nlow and even temperature for curing, we do not need to work all the\r\ngoodness out of the curd to make a firm cheese. We do not have to cut\r\nthe fats and phosphates out with acid, nor to dry all the moisture out\r\nby fine cutting and high scalding or long scalding. We can stop the\r\ncooking when the curd is evenly cooked through so as to be springy when\r\npressed together by the hands, take it out of the whey before the acid\r\ndevelops, and put it to press without unnecessary delay.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN EXAMPLE.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1884, we ate some cheese at Mr. N.L. Brown's, Gurnee,\r\nIll., which was dipped sweeter and put to press softer than we ever\r\nthought of doing; yet the cheese was close-grained and fine-flavored,\r\nand one that would pass muster as a first-class cheese anywhere. But it\r\nwas not cured in a hot curing room, nor in one where the temperature\r\nwent up and down the same as it did on the outside of the building.\r\nIt was placed in his cellar, at a temperature of 64 degrees, and\r\nthere remained until it was fit to cut. Nor was it even rubbed, but\r\noccasionally turned over. When out, it looked like a cheese that had\r\nbeen kept in a box a year, covered with mold and mites. The superfluous\r\nmoisture was dried out but the butter was all left. It demonstrated\r\nwhat can be done by temperature. Had this cheese been cured in an\r\nordinary curing-room, it would have gone all out of shape in a few\r\ndays--as soon as rapid fermentation set in--and been off flavor by\r\nthe time it was ten days old. Several other cheeses were cured in the\r\nsame cellar, in the same way, but none of them were put to press so\r\nsoft or sweet, but all sweet-curd cheeses, and all buttery and fine.\r\nThis particular one was the result of hurry, as other matters than\r\nthe curd demanded attention. But the thought came that it would be a\r\ngood experiment, as it was, and the result was satisfactory, though\r\nnot different from what was expected. Cheeses made in the same way as\r\nthe others that were cured in the cellar, and some cooked more and\r\nsoured more, were made by the same gentleman and cured in an ordinary\r\ncuring-room. In hot weather, they swelled and some of them got out of\r\nshape, while the flavor was sharp and rough. But those in the cellar,\r\nat 64 degrees, apparently never moved a hair's breadth out of shape,\r\nwere as solid as old butter, yet firm enough for shipping even, and of\r\nthe finest flavor. It is hardly necessary to say that the cellar was\r\nexceedingly clean and sweet, and was well ventilated. These cheeses\r\nwere a demonstration, if not a revelation.\r\n\r\n\r\nMOISTURE IN CURING.\r\n\r\nIt should be remarked, by the way, that a curing-room does not want to\r\nbe a dry room. We do not want to dry cheese; we want to cure it; that\r\nis, let it go through the proper chemical change. This it does best in\r\na somewhat moist room, in which the surface does not dry and become\r\nhard and impervious, so that the gases cannot escape. It is better to\r\ncontend with a little mold than a dry atmosphere.\r\n\r\n\r\nBETTER CHEESE CAN BE MADE.\r\n\r\nWe see, on turning to Prof. Arnold's \"American Dairying,\" that he\r\nsays: \"The temperature of a curing-room for whole milk should be 65 to\r\n70 degrees; for part skims, 75 to 80 degrees.\" It is thus seen that\r\nfat plays an important part in curing. \"The more fat,\" he says, \"the\r\ncooler may be the room; and the less fat, the warmer may it be.\" Again:\r\n\"Under the present state of things, a cheese that will stand a voyage\r\nof 4,000 miles can hardly be called a fancy cheese. * * * But a much\r\nfancier cheese than we are now producing, one that will stand shipping,\r\ncan be made. To do this will require milk to be free from some of the\r\nimperfections which are now quite common; it must be transported to\r\nthe factories in much better ventilated cans; _it must be made with\r\nless rennet and less acidity; and it must be cured in an even and lower\r\ntemperature_.\" We mark the conclusion in _italics_, because we believe\r\nthese are vital points. We insist that we cannot do ourselves credit\r\nnor realize the best financial results in cheese making until we build\r\nbetter curing rooms--rooms in which we can control the temperature\r\nwithout fail. We have not yet settled down to cheese making. We are\r\nstill trying experiments and resorting to temporary expedients. We must\r\nbuild far more deliberately and for permanency. It is not necessary\r\nthat we should point out just how a building may be erected so as to\r\ngive control of the inside temperature. Architects know how to do\r\nit. When our cheese makers get to the point where they demand such\r\nbuildings, they will get them without much trouble and at moderate\r\nexpense. It is only necessary that they should have the \"will.\" The\r\n\"way\" will speedily open.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe notice that, in some localities, the patrons of the cheese factory\r\nare very much interested in the question of the value of whey for\r\nfeeding purposes--some going so far as to assert that what is left of\r\nmilk in cheese making is as valuable as what is removed! This is a\r\nstartling assertion, and, if true, would convict our dairymen of a vast\r\namount of stupid waste. Is it true? Let us try to get at the facts of\r\nthe case by a direct, common-sense investigation of it.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPOSITION OF MILK.\r\n\r\nWe will begin with the composition of milk. From hundreds of German\r\nanalyses, ranging from 81.30 to 91.50 parts of water, we take a fair\r\naverage analysis, which we think will do justice to the mixed milk of\r\nour best cheese factories:\r\n\r\n  Water                  87.18\r\n  Caseine                 4.21\r\n  Albumen                  .55\r\n  Fat                     3.24\r\n  Sugar                   4.21\r\n  Ash                      .60\r\n                         -----\r\n        Total            99.99\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT IS TAKEN OUT BY CHEESE MAKING.\r\n\r\nNow, in making cheese, what follows? We ought to secure all the\r\ncaseine, but we do not quite. There is a small waste. We loose all, or\r\nnearly all, of the albumen. We leave in the whey most of the sugar, if\r\nwe do not convert it into acid before getting rid of the whey, in which\r\ncase we may have an injurious amount of the acid in the curd, besides\r\ndissolving and washing out nearly all the ash, which is composed of\r\nphosphates, principally of iron, magnesia and lime. These are changed\r\ninto lactates, leaving the phosphoric acid free--not a very good\r\nfood for anything but rats. We ought to save nearly or quite all the\r\nash--the phosphates. But by the ordinary process of cheese making,\r\nthese are nearly all lost, as is shown by the analyses of whey, which\r\nprobably accounts for the low estimate in the popular mind of the\r\nvalue of cheese as food, it being rated at one-half the value that\r\nit would have were the phosphates all retained. But, four-fifths of\r\nthe nitrogenous and muscle-making material has been removed, and also\r\nnine-tenths of the fat, which is heat producing and some say furnishes\r\nmotor power. We have retained in the cheese 5.84 of the 12.82 parts\r\nof solids, leaving 5.98 parts, 4.21 parts of which are sugar and not\r\nwanted in the cheese, or, at most, only a fraction of it. We leave less\r\nthan one part of the albuminous and caseous matter, which is the most\r\nvaluable, and only one-third of one part of fat. So there is less than\r\none part of solids left besides sugar, and the rest of the whey is\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPOSITION OF WHEY.\r\n\r\nWhat is whey, then, but sweetened water, using sugar of a very low\r\nsweetening quality, with a fraction of albuminous matter and ash in\r\nit? Again, by the so-called \"sweet\" process, which retains all, or\r\nnearly all, the phosphates in the cheese, the whey is made still poorer\r\nby analysis. Only the sugar and a fraction of the albuminous matter,\r\nnot coagulated by rennet, is left in the whey; and the amount of sugar\r\nin milk varies considerably, ranging, in a large number of German\r\nanalyses, from 3.0 to 5.48 per cent. of sugar. But let us more closely\r\nexamine the composition of whey. An average of eighteen analyses made\r\nby Voelcker is as follows:\r\n\r\n  Water                93.02\r\n  Nitrogenous matter     .96\r\n  Fat                    .33\r\n  Ash                    .70\r\n  Sugar              }  4.99\r\n  Lactic acid        }\r\n                       -----\r\n       Total          100.00\r\n\r\n\r\nPOOR STUFF.\r\n\r\nThus it is very plainly to be seen that whey is poor stuff to feed,\r\neven in its best estate. It has some value to mix with other foods,\r\nif used sweet; but when the sugar has all turned to acid, and the\r\nphosphates have become lactates, leaving the phosphoric acid free,\r\nthe whey is abominable, and can be used only in small quantities and\r\nwith great care. It ought not to be fed to young animals with tender\r\nstomachs, and does older animals no good.\r\n\r\n\r\nCRUELTY TO ANIMALS.\r\n\r\nAll this corresponds with general observation and experience. The most\r\nintelligent dairymen with whom we are acquainted do not consider sour\r\nwhey worth drawing home. It is cruel to feed sweet whey to any animal\r\nexclusively. Even a hog, which has made its growth--and no animal\r\ncan more fully extract the nutrihealth while actually growing fat\r\non sweet whey. The portion of less than one per cent. of albuminous\r\nmatter prolongs, rather than sustains life. That is to say, the hog\r\nwill not starve to death quite so quick if fed whey as it will without\r\nit. The sugar accumulates in the system as fat, while the hog is slowly\r\nperishing of inanition. But if it is thus cruel to feed it alone to\r\nfull grown animals, it is doubly so to feed it to young and growing\r\nanimals--as pigs and calves--the necessities of the lives of which\r\ndemand tissue-making material as well as life-sustaining. If whey is\r\nused, let it be fed sweet, and always with some kind of dry nitrogenous\r\nfood, as bean meal, oil meal, pea meal, clover, etc. But, with the\r\nacid system of cheese-making, it is impossible to do this. The whey is\r\ndecomposed before run into the whey-vat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE END]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  PREFACE                                                         3-4\r\n\r\n  HISTORICAL--In Asia; Among the Jews; In Southern Europe;\r\n  In America; Figures from the Census; Growth in\r\n  Thirty Years; Product per Cow and per Capita; Home\r\n  Consumption vs. Exports; Forms of Milk Consumption;\r\n  The Private Dairy vs. the Factory                              5-12\r\n\r\n  CONDITIONS--Pastures; Water; Winter Food; The Stable;\r\n  Shelter; The Dairy House; Cleanliness; The Herd.              13-17\r\n\r\n  DAIRY STOCK--Points of a Milker; Dutch-Friesian; The\r\n  Jersey; The Guernsey; The Ayrshire; The Shorthorn;\r\n  The Devon; The American Holderness; Inbreeding;\r\n  Swiss; Polled; Hereford; Common Stock                         18-34\r\n\r\n  BREEDING DAIRY STOCK--Selection; Coupling; Care               35-39\r\n\r\n  FEEDING STOCK--Carbonaceous and Nitrogenous Foods;\r\n  What is Carbon?

SALT\r\n\r\n                               WARRANTED\r\n\r\n                  as Pure as any Salt in the Market.\r\n\r\n     Not Excelled for Butter or Cheese, for the Table, or for all\r\n                          Culinary Purposes.\r\n\r\n    The following is the analysis made by Prof. Babcock, of the New\r\n    York Experiment Station, in January, 1884:\r\n\r\n    Water                                             0.593\r\n    Insoluble Matter                                  0.019\r\n    Sulphate of Lime                                  0.760\r\n    Sulphate of Magnesia                              0.094\r\n    Chloride of Sodium (Pure Salt)                   98.501\r\n                                                     ------\r\n                                                     99.967\r\n\r\n    It will be seen by the foregoing that, the Onondaga F.F. Salt\r\n    is very pure, containing only 1-1/2 per cent. of impurities and\r\n    water. The amount of pure salt is 98.501. This is not materially\r\n    different from the analysis of Walz & Stillwell, made by the\r\n    direction of the New York Butter and Cheese Exchange, in 1875--one\r\n    analysis showing 98.5242, and the other 98.3864 parts of pure salt.\r\n    Ashton contained, according to their analysis, 97.7598, and Higgin\r\n    97.6809 parts of pure salt, the impurities equaling 2.20 per cent.\r\n    in Ashton and 2.25 per cent. in Higgin, while the impurities in\r\n    Onondaga F.F. Salt are only 1.50 per cent.\r\n\r\n    First premiums were taken at New Orleans, at the World's Fair, by\r\n    both Butter and Cheese salted with Onondaga F.F. Salt. It wins\r\n    everywhere that there is open and fair competition. Dairy goods\r\n    salted with it took a majority of all the premiums (46 out of 89)\r\n    awarded at the Grand Union Fair in Milwaukee, December 2d to 9th.\r\n    1882, over four foreign competitors. It was awarded a medal at the\r\n    Centennial by a committee of scientists and experts from all parts\r\n    of the world, \"for purity and high degree of excellence.\"\r\n\r\n    SOLE Manufacturers,\r\n\r\n    AMERICAN DAIRY SALT CO., L.\r\n\r\n    ADDRESS\r\n\r\n        J.W.
