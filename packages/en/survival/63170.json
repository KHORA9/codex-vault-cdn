The dotted area shows where crimson clover was generally\r\ngrown before 1938. The cross-hatched area shows where production can be\r\nextended by using favorable cultural and fertilizer treatments and adapted\r\nvarieties.]\r\n\r\nCRIMSON clover (_Trifolium incarnatum_) is the most important winter\r\nannual legume of the central section of the Eastern States. This crop can\r\nbe grown over a much larger area by using seed of adapted varieties for\r\neach section, by using better cultural methods, and by fertilizing the\r\nsoil (fig. 1). Besides being an excellent pasture plant and furnishing\r\nplenty of hay, it protects the soil during fall, winter, and spring,\r\nprevents soil washing, and provides green manure for soil improvement.\r\nThis legume has the distinct advantage of producing large quantities of\r\nseed that can be easily harvested and sown without the use of expensive\r\nmachinery. Crimson clover is a native of Europe and is widely grown in\r\nFrance, Hungary, and other central and southern European countries. Seed\r\nwas introduced into this country as early as 1819, but it was not until\r\n1880 that the plant became important. The acreage has been steadily\r\nincreasing. During the 5-year period 1940-45 the annual purchase of seed\r\nthrough markets in the United States has ranged from 6 to 18 million\r\npounds. In 1935 about 2 million pounds were used. In addition, large\r\nquantities of home-grown seed are handled from farm to farm.\r\n\r\nThe common name of this clover is derived from the bright crimson color of\r\nthe blossoms. Other such common names as German clover and scarlet clover\r\nare frequently used. In general the leaves and stems resemble those of red\r\nclover, but are distinguished by the rounded tips of the leaves and more\r\nhair on both leaves and stems. When crimson clover is planted in fall the\r\nleaves develop from the crown and form a rosette, which enlarges whenever\r\nweather conditions are favorable. In spring, flower stems develop rapidly\r\nand end their growth with long pointed flower heads. Seed forms and the\r\nplant dies with the coming of hot summer weather. The seed is yellow and\r\nis about twice as large as red clover seed and more rounded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=Adaptation=\r\n\r\n\r\nCrimson clover does well in cool, humid weather and is tolerant of winter\r\nconditions where the temperature does not become severe or too changeable.\r\nIt may be planted from midsummer to late fall. In the northern part of the\r\nregion early seeding and growth are necessary for the seedlings to survive\r\nthe winter. It will thrive both on sandy and clay soils and is tolerant of\r\nordinary soil acidity. On very poor soils, stands are difficult to obtain\r\nand the growth is stunted. The use of phosphate and potash fertilizers and\r\nmanure on such soils will help to obtain good stands.\r\n\r\nCrimson clover may also be grown successfully as a summer annual in\r\nnorthern Maine, Michigan, and Minnesota. Winter culture can be extended\r\ninto Kentucky, southern Missouri, southern Indiana, and Ohio, provided\r\nvarieties are grown that are adapted to these sections and the seed is\r\nsown in fertile soils early in August.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=Seedbed Preparation=\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most important and difficult part of producing a large crop is getting\r\na stand. Enough soil moisture to sprout the seed and establish the\r\nseedlings is the greatest factor in obtaining a stand. When established,\r\ncommon crimson clover usually produces a good crop.\r\n\r\nSeedings may be made alone or combined with winter grains, ryegrass, or\r\ngrass sod. It is possible also to seed between the rows of cultivated\r\ncrops, but it is difficult to make an ideal seedbed. Furthermore, the crop\r\nplants in the row shade the clover seedlings and use some of the available\r\nmoisture. If the row crop is planted in wider rows and seeded more thinly,\r\nthe clover will become better established. When planted between the rows\r\nof other crops, the seed is usually broadcast on the surface and covered\r\nby cultivating or harrowing. Drilling the seed after the soil surface has\r\nbeen stirred usually gives more complete stands than broadcasting, and it\r\nmay be done with a small one-horse drill. The seed should not be planted\r\nmore than one-half to three-fourths of an inch deep, respectively, in clay\r\nand sandy soils.\r\n\r\nCrimson clover is often seeded following a grain crop. This is a surer\r\nmethod of establishing a stand than planting between the rows of\r\ncultivated crops, provided the seedbed is well prepared. After the grain\r\ncrop is harvested the soil is plowed or disked and allowed to settle.\r\nThis is followed by light harrowing or disking to kill weed seedlings.\r\nBefore the clover is seeded the sod should be firmly packed, because a\r\nloose cloddy seedbed will not produce good stands. The seed may be either\r\ndrilled or broadcast, but drilling will give more uniform stands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=Fertilizers=\r\n\r\n\r\nGood stands and growth cannot be expected on very poor soils. Soil\r\nconditions can be improved by adding phosphate and potash fertilizers and\r\nmanure or by turning under such crops as cowpeas, soybeans, or lespedeza.\r\nIn many soils of low fertility the use of a complete fertilizer will\r\nencourage early seedling growth and establishment. On fertile sods crimson\r\nclover may be successfully grown without fertilizer, but on most sods\r\napplications of 200 to 400 pounds per acre of phosphate and 50 to 100\r\npounds of potash pay in obtaining good stands and vigorous growth (fig. 2).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 2.--Effect of phosphate application on good soil:\r\nTreated (left); untreated (right).]\r\n\r\nFrequently a single large application of phosphate and potash fertilizer\r\nis sufficient to produce two crops of crimson clover before it becomes\r\nnecessary to make another application. In some soils the addition of such\r\nminor elements as boron may improve growth and increase seed yields. Since\r\nthe need for minor elements varies from place to place, their use should\r\nbe based on the recommendations of the agricultural experiment station of\r\nthe State in which the clover is planted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=Seed Sources and Varieties=\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore World War II more than half the crimson clover seed used in the\r\nUnited States was imported, principally from Hungary and France. Since\r\n1938 domestic production has rapidly increased, reaching more than 18\r\nmillion pounds in 1942. Tennessee produced more than half the home supply.\r\nNearly all the crimson clover may be called common crimson clover, since\r\nit does not represent strains or varieties having special characteristics.\r\nWhite-flower strains and several others that differ slightly in maturity\r\nhave been selected but have not been used.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=Dixie Crimson Clover=\r\n\r\n\r\nDixie crimson clover is a new hard-seeded variety that has given promising\r\nresults in extensive trials. It is more widely adapted than common crimson\r\nclover, as it grows well in the Gulf coast section and appears to be\r\nslightly more winter-hardy than common crimson. Dixie has successfully\r\nvolunteered to good stands when grown in pastures with Bermuda grass, with\r\nsmall grains for grazing, and in rotation with such cultivated crops as\r\nsorghum or late-planted corn.\r\n\r\nSeed of Dixie shattered in harvesting operations has successfully produced\r\ngood volunteer stands in fall. When used in rotations with cultivated\r\ncrops, the seed must be matured before the seedbed is prepared for the\r\nfollowing crop. When Dixie is used in pasture, care should be taken to\r\nprevent close grazing at the time of blooming, since it may limit the\r\nquantity of seed produced and cause thin fall stands. Summer-growing\r\ngrasses must be either closely grazed or clipped in fall to give the\r\nclover seedlings a chance to become established.\r\n\r\nThe seed and plants of Dixie cannot be distinguished from common\r\ncrimson clover, and the variety may be readily contaminated by either\r\ncross-pollination or mechanical mixtures. For these reasons the farmer\r\nbuying Dixie should buy only certified seed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=Rate and Time of Seeding=\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder ordinary conditions 12 to 15 pounds of hulled seed to the acre will\r\ngive good stands unless there is lack of soil moisture. Depending upon the\r\nquantity of chaff and pieces of stems, 45 to 60 pounds of unhulled seed\r\nis comparable with 15 pounds of hulled seed. Crimson clover may be sown\r\nfrom the middle of July until November, depending upon the location, with\r\nthe expectation of obtaining a good stand. The later it is seeded the less\r\ngrowth can be expected and the more readily winterkilling occurs. Early\r\nestablishment becomes more important as plantings are extended northward.\r\nSeeding crimson clover either immediately before or following heavy rains,\r\nif possible, increases its chances of making a stand. Spring planting\r\nin or south of the Corn Belt usually results in a short, stunted growth\r\nfollowed by little blossoming and low yield.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=Inoculation=\r\n\r\n\r\nIn many areas where crimson clover has been grown successfully for several\r\nyears it is not necessary to inoculate the seed with bacterial cultures\r\nfor the production of nodules. But either the seed or the soil must be\r\ninoculated if crimson clover has not been grown. If the plants are not\r\ninoculated they will develop slowly, become yellow, and die. Inoculated\r\nplants are able to obtain about two-thirds of then nitrogen from the air\r\nthrough then root nodules. The plants may be artificially inoculated by\r\napplying cultures of the bacteria to the seed or by scattering soil from a\r\nfield where inoculated crimson clover has been grown. Two hundred to three\r\nhundred pounds per acre of such soil evenly distributed at seeding time is\r\nusually sufficient.\r\n\r\nWhen crimson clover is grown for the first time an additional inoculation\r\ntreatment is recommended if weather conditions are dry and hot after\r\nseeding. This supplemental inoculation consists in mixing commercial\r\ncultures with sand, soil, or cottonseed meal and broadcasting the\r\nmixture over the soil surface during cloudy, rainy weather as the young\r\nseedlings are emerging. A bushel-size culture mixed with 60 pounds of the\r\nabove-mentioned material is sufficient for an acre if distributed evenly.\r\nSoil from a field where inoculated crimson clover has been grown may also\r\nbe used for the supplemental treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=Unhulled Seed=\r\n\r\n\r\nUsing unhulled common seed increases the chance of obtaining thick stands.\r\nWhen the soil is dry, light rainfall does not cause the unhulled seed to\r\nsprout, but hulled seed germinates readily and the seedlings may die from\r\nlack of moisture before they can become established.\r\n\r\nIts bulky nature makes unhulled seed more difficult to distribute\r\nuniformly than hulled seed. It must be broadcast and may be harrowed in.\r\nIt is also difficult to market and is not generally handled by the seed\r\ntrade. But farmers can harvest seed for their own use and save the expense\r\nof having it hulled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=Companion Crops=\r\n\r\n\r\nRye, vetch, ryegrass, and fall-sown grain crops are often seeded with\r\ncrimson clover. Such crops are seeded at half to a third the normal rate,\r\nand the crimson clover is seeded at half to two-thirds the normal rate.\r\nSeeding is done at the same time, but, as a greater depth is required\r\nfor most of the seed of the companion crops, two seeding operations are\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nFarmers often use a mixture of 5 pounds of red clover and 10 pounds of\r\ncrimson clover per acre with excellent results. The first growth of the\r\nmixture may be grazed or harvested for hay or for crimson clover seed,\r\nwhile the second crop is wholly red clover. Dixie crimson clover has given\r\ngood results when planted with Johnson and Bermuda grasses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=Diseases and Insects=\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most serious disease that affects crimson clover is crown rot. The\r\neffect of this disease is seen early in spring and is characterized by\r\nthe plants dying in patches. The stems rot at the surface of the soil or\r\nwhere they join the crown. Continued damp, cool weather during winter and\r\nearly spring favors the development of the disease. This disease can be\r\ncontrolled by not growing clover or other legumes in rotation for 2 to 5\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nSandy soils in the southern part of the crimson clover belt are often\r\ninfested with nematodes. Nematode injury stunts and yellows the plants.\r\nWhile the clover-seed chalcid, the pea aphid, and other insects sometimes\r\nbecome numerous in crimson clover, insects do not ordinarily cause\r\nappreciable damage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=Utilization=\r\n\r\n\r\nCrimson clover grows rapidly in fall and spring and furnishes an abundance\r\nof grazing (fig. 3). If planted early and good fall growth is made,\r\nthe clover may also be grazed during the fall and winter months. Such\r\na practice has been successfully followed in many States where crimson\r\nclover is providing winter pasture. Crimson clover combined with small\r\ngrains or ryegrass has been most widely used for winter grazing. Crimson\r\nclover makes little growth during cold periods in winter. Under such\r\nconditions, to prevent close grazing, it is necessary to remove the\r\nanimals or shift them to other fields that have not been grazed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 3.--Crimson clover provides an abundance of early\r\nspring grazing.]\r\n\r\nAnimals grazing on crimson clover seldom bloat; however, it is advisable\r\nnot to turn them into clover fields for the first time when they are\r\nhungry. Bloat is less likely to occur on a mixture of clover and grass\r\nor grain then when the clover alone is grazed. As crimson clover reaches\r\nmaturity the hairs of the heads and stems become hard and tough. When\r\nit is grazed continuously or when it is fed as hay at this stage large\r\nmasses of the hairs are liable to form into hair balls in stomachs of\r\nhorses and mules, occasionally with fatal results. If small quantities of\r\nother feeds, particularly roughages, are fed along with the clover, the\r\nformation of these balls will be reduced. Cattle, sheep, and swine do not\r\nseem to be affected.\r\n\r\nCrimson clover makes excellent hay when cut at the early-bloom stage,\r\nalthough the yield may be slightly reduced. For best yields it should be\r\nharvested in full bloom. The hay is easily cured either in the swath or in\r\nthe windrow. Fewer leaves are lost and less bleaching occurs in windrowed\r\nhay. Although yields as high as 2½ tons per acre are not uncommon on\r\nfertile soil, 1½ to 2 tons is the usual harvest.\r\n\r\nCrimson clover is an ideal green-manure crop. For best results it should\r\nbe plowed under 2 to 3 weeks before the succeeding crop is planted. This\r\ngives enough time for decomposition, which is rapid unless the crop is\r\nripe when turned under. Occasionally strips are plowed in which row\r\ncrops are to be planted, allowing the clover between the plowed strips\r\nto mature. Seed may be harvested by hand from the clover between the row\r\ncrops, and the remaining clover straw allowed to mat and serve as a mulch,\r\nor the entire plant may be permitted to form a mulch.\r\n\r\nCrimson clover may be made into silage by the same methods as are used\r\nfor other legumes and grasses. In orchards it is often allowed to mature,\r\nafter which it is disked into the soil. A volunteer stand from shattered\r\nseed may be obtained in fall by using the Dixie variety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=Seed Production=\r\n\r\n\r\nCrimson clover is a heavy seed-producing plant, and yields of 5 to 10\r\nbushels per acre are common, depending upon the thickness of the stand,\r\nthe extent of growth produced, and the care used in harvesting the seed.\r\nThe florets are self-fertile, but bees increase the number of seed\r\nper head by tripping and transferring the pollen. Placing colonies of\r\nhoneybees next to blooming fields will increase pollination. More seed is\r\nusually produced on soils of medium fertility than on rich soils, since\r\nfertile soils seem to stimulate the growth of stems and leaves rather than\r\ndevelop flower heads.\r\n\r\nLarge yields and ease of harvesting seed are two important reasons why\r\ncrimson clover is such an ideal legume crop. Farmers can save seed with\r\nvery little expense other than their own labor. When the seed heads are\r\nmature they readily shatter and are easily harvested either by hand\r\nstripping or by using horse-drawn home-made strippers. One bushel of\r\nunhulled seed contains about 2 pounds of hulled seed, and although bulky,\r\nit can be easily stored on the farm until fall.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 4.--Crimson clover seed crop cut with a mower\r\nequipped with a bunching attachment.]\r\n\r\nWhen the seed is mature the crop is cut with a mower (fig. 4), which\r\nmay be equipped with a bunching or windrowing attachment, or it can be\r\nharvested with a combine. During wet seasons it is sometimes difficult\r\nto combine the seed from standing plants. Under such conditions the\r\nplants can be cut and windrowed and than threshed by the combine from\r\nthe windrow. As crimson clover shatters easily when ripe, cutting with\r\nthe mower when the heads are damp with dew or rain is recommended. If it\r\nis allowed to stand too long after ripening a beating rain will shatter\r\nmuch of the seed. After a few days of curing, the seed is hulled with\r\nan ordinary clover huller, with a grain separator equipped with hulling\r\nattachments, or by a combine equipped with pick-up attachments or used\r\nas a stationary machine. The less the clover is handled the less seed\r\nwill be lost by shattering. Many troublesome weeds are difficult to\r\nseparate from crimson clover seed, including field peppergrass (_Lepidium\r\ncampestre_), wintercress (_Barbarea praecox_), and the bulblets of\r\nwild onion (_Allium_ spp.), which are probably the worst. Seed of the\r\nmustards, rapes, and turnips (_Brassica_ spp.), dock (_Rumex crispus_),\r\nwild geranium (_Geranium dissectum_), sorrel (_Rumex acetosella_), and\r\ncatchweed (_Galium aparine_) are also found in the seed. Little barley\r\n(_Hordeum pusillum_) is a pest in unhulled seed, and the use of such seed\r\nwill naturally increase the prevalence of this weed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  U. S.
