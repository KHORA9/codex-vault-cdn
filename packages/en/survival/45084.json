Taylor, F.L.S., F.G.S.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great end of natural-history reading should be the development of\r\na love for the objects dwelt upon, and a desire to know more about\r\nthem. This can only be brought about by such practical acquaintance as\r\ncollecting and preserving them induces. At the same time we should be\r\nsorry to see our young readers degenerate into mere collectors! It is\r\na great mistake to suppose, that because you have a full cabinet of\r\nbutterflies, moths, or beetles, therefore you are a good entomologist;\r\nor that you may lay claim to a distinguished position as a geologist,\r\non account of drawers full of fossils and minerals. But this is a\r\nmistake into which young naturalists frequently fall. We have seen\r\npeople with decided tastes for these studies never get beyond the\r\nmere collecting. In that case they stand on a par with collectors of\r\npostage-stamps. Nor is there much gained, even if you become acquainted\r\nwith English, or even Latin, names of natural-history objects. Many\r\npeople can catalogue them glibly, and never make a slip, and yet they\r\nare practically ignorant of the _real_ knowledge which clusters round\r\neach object, and its relation to others. Both Latin and English names\r\nare useful and even necessary; but when you have simply learnt them,\r\nand nothing more, how much wiser are you than before? No, let the\r\nlearning of names be the alphabet of science--the means by which you\r\ncan acquire a further knowledge of its mysteries. It would be just as\r\nreasonable to set up for a literary man on the strength of accurately\r\nknowing the alphabet, as to imagine you are a scientific man the moment\r\nyou have learned by heart a few scores of Latin names of plants,\r\nfossils, or insects! Let each object represent so much knowledge, to\r\nwhich the very mention of its name will immediately conjure up a crowd\r\nof associations, relationships, and intimate acquaintances, and you\r\nwill then see what a store of real knowledge may be represented in a\r\ncarefully-arranged cabinet.\r\n\r\nThe heading of the present articles will have indicated the subject\r\nchosen for brief treatment. We shall never forget the influence left\r\nby reading such charming and suggestive books as Mantell's 'Medals\r\nof Creation,' many years ago. Our mind had been prepared for the\r\nenthusiasm which this little book produced by the perusal of Page's\r\n'Introductory Text-book,' Phillips's 'Guide to Geology,' and several\r\nothers of a similar character. But we know of none which impels a\r\nyoung student to go into the field and hammer out fossils for himself,\r\nlike Dr. Mantell's works. It is impossible not to catch the enthusiasm\r\nof his nature. The first place we sallied out to, on our maiden\r\ngeological trip, was a heap of coal-shale, near a pit's mouth, in the\r\nneighbourhood of Manchester. Our only weapon was a common house hammer,\r\nfor we then knew nothing of the technical forms which geological fancy\r\nso often assumes. We had passed that same heap of coal-shale hundreds\r\nof times, without suspecting it to be anything more than everybody else\r\nconsidered it viz. a heap of rubbish. Why that particular spot was\r\nselected, we cannot now say. We had seen illustrations of carboniferous\r\nplants, shells, &c., in books, but we seemed to imagine their discovery\r\ncould only be effected by scientific men, and that it required a good\r\ndeal of knowledge before one should attempt to find them. Suffice it to\r\nsay we made the pilgrimage to the coal-shale heap in pretty much the\r\nsame mind as we should expect to get the head prize in some fine-art\r\ndrawing. The humble hammer was put into use, for a brief time without\r\nmuch effect, as we could hardly have commenced on a more barren kind of\r\nshale than we had chanced to hit upon. We imagined we could perceive\r\ntraces of leaves and slender stems, but were afraid to trust our eyes.\r\nAt any rate, there was nothing definite enough to raise our enthusiasm.\r\nBut by-and-by, as the hammer kept cleaving open the thin leaf-like\r\nlayers of shale, there appeared a large portion of that most beautiful\r\nof all fossil plants, the _Lepidodendron_. Those who are familiar with\r\nthis object, with its lozenge-shaped markings running spirally up the\r\nstem, will readily understand the outburst of pleasure which escaped\r\nour lips! That was the first real fossil--a pleasure quite equivalent\r\nto that of landing the first salmon. How carefully was it wrapped in\r\npaper, and carried home in the pocket! There never was, and never will\r\nbe, another fossil in the world as beautiful as that insignificant\r\nfragment of _Lepidodendron_.\r\n\r\nWe have seen a good many converts made to geology in a similar manner,\r\nsince first we laid open to the light this silent memorial of ages\r\nwhich have passed away. Let a man have ever so slight acquaintance with\r\ngeology, and give him the chance of hammering out a fossil for himself,\r\nand the odds are you thereby make him a geologist for life. There is\r\nsomething almost romantic in the idea that you are looking for the\r\nfirst time, and have yourself disentombed the remains of creatures\r\nwhich probably lived scores of millions of years ago! We would strongly\r\nadvise our readers, therefore, not to fall into the error of supposing\r\nthat fossil-hunting belongs to highly-trained geologists. On the\r\ncontrary, it is by fossil-hunting alone that you can ever hope to be a\r\ngeologist yourself. Another mistake often made, is that of supposing\r\nthese rich and interesting geological localities are at a distance.\r\nIt seems so hard to suppose, after reading about typical sections,\r\n&c., that under your very feet, in the fields where you have so often\r\nplayed, there occur geological phenomena of no less interest. But it\r\nis actually surprising what evidences of our earth's great antiquity,\r\nin the shape of fossils, &c., may be studied and obtained in the most\r\nout-of-the-way and insignificant places.\r\n\r\nYou say you have no _rocks_ in your neighbourhood--nothing but barren\r\nsands, or beds of brick-earth or clay. Well, go to some section of\r\nthe latter, exposed, perhaps, in some tarn or stagnant pond in a\r\nturnip-field. You examine the sides, and what do you see? Nothing, but\r\nhere and there a boulder-stone sticking out. Well, be content with\r\nthat. You said you had no rocks in your neighbourhood; how, then, has\r\nthat boulder, which is a rounded fragment of a rock broken off from\r\nsomewhere--how has it come there? Here is a poser at once. Examine\r\nit, and you will perhaps see that its hard surface is polished or\r\nscratched, and then you remember the theory of icebergs, and feel\r\nastonished to think that you hold in your hand an undeniable proof\r\nof the truth of that theory. Those very scratchings could have been\r\nproduced in no other way; that foreign fragment of a rock now only to\r\nbe found on some distant mountain-side could have been conveyed in no\r\nother manner. Not content with the exterior examination, you break\r\nthe boulder-stone open, when you may chance to find it is a portion\r\nof silurian, carboniferous or oolitic limestone, and that it contains\r\n_fossils_ belonging to one of those formations. Here is a find--an\r\nobject with a double interest turning up where you never expected\r\nto discover the slightest geological incident! You examine other\r\nboulders, and find in them general evidences of ice-action in their\r\npresent re-deposition, and most instructive lessons as to the nature of\r\nrocks of various formations, from the granite and trap series to the\r\nfossiliferous deposits. In fact, there is no place like one of these\r\nold boulder-pits for making oneself acquainted with petrology, or the\r\nnature of stones.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1. Pocket Trimming-hammer.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2. Duck's-head Hammer.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now, as to the _tools_ necessary to the young geologist. First\r\nof all, he cannot take _too few_! It is a great mistake to imagine\r\nthat a full set of scientific instruments makes a scientific man.\r\nThe following hammers, intended for different purposes, ought to be\r\nprocured. Fig. 1 is an exceedingly useful weapon, and one we commonly\r\nuse, to the exclusion of all others. It is handy for breaking off\r\nfragments of rock for examination; and, if fossils be included in them,\r\nfor trimming the specimens for cabinet purposes. As a rule, however,\r\nfield geologists are always divided over the merits of their hammers,\r\nsome preferring one shape and some another. Fig. 2 is generally\r\nused for breaking up hard rocks, for which the bevel-shaped head is\r\npeculiarly adapted. It is usually much heavier than the rest, and is\r\nseldom used except for specific purposes. If our readers are inclined\r\nto study sections of boulder clay, and wish to extract the rounded\r\nand angular boulder from its stiff matrix, they cannot do better than\r\nuse a hammer like Fig. 3. This is sometimes called the \"Platypus\"\r\npick. Both ends can be used, and the pick end is also good for working\r\non soft rocks, like chalk. A little practice in the field will teach\r\nthe student how to use these tools, and when, much better than we can\r\ndescribe on paper. The hammers can be obtained from any Scientific\r\ninstrument manufacturer, or from any of the dealers in geological\r\nspecimens. We have found that the best hammers for usage, however, were\r\nto be made out of an old file, softened and well welded, rolled, and\r\nthen hammered into a solid mass. If properly tempered a hammer made in\r\nthis fashion will last you your life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3. \"Platypus\" Pick for clay, &c.]\r\n\r\nSo much for the rougher weapons of geological strife. Next, be sure\r\nand provide yourself with _thick-soled_ shoes or boots. Geological\r\nstudy will take you into a good many queer places, wet and dry, rough\r\nand smooth, and it is absolutely necessary to be prepared for the\r\nworst. Patent leather boots and kid gloves are rarely worn by practical\r\ngeologists. And we have heard it remarked at the British Association\r\nmeetings, that they could always tell which members belonged to the\r\nGeological Section by their _thick-soled_ boots. A similar remark\r\napplies to clothes. The student need not dress for the quarry as he\r\nwould for the dining room. Good, strong, serviceable material ought to\r\nbe their basis.\r\n\r\nSecondly, as to the student's comforts and necessaries. These are\r\ngenerally the last thing an ardent naturalist thinks about. For\r\nourselves, however, we give him ample leave to provide himself with\r\npipe and tobacco, should his tastes lie in that direction. _We_ never\r\nenjoyed a pipe half so much as when solitarily disinterring organic\r\nremains which had slumbered in the heart of the rock for myriads of\r\nages. As to the _beer_, we can vouch that it never tastes anything like\r\nso good as during a geological excursion.\r\n\r\nWe have found the leathern bags sold for school-book purposes to be\r\nas handy to deposit specimens in, during a journey, as anything else.\r\nThey have the merit of being cheap, are strong, and easily carried. If\r\nnot large enough, then get a strong, coarse linen haversack, like that\r\nworn by volunteers on a field day. Paper, cotton _wadding_ (not wool),\r\nsawdust for fragments of larger fossils, intended to be repaired\r\nat home, wooden pill-boxes, and a few boxes, which may be obtained\r\nfrom any practical naturalist, with _glass tops_, are sufficient\r\n\"stock-in-trade\" for the young geologist. The wadding does not adhere\r\nto the specimens as wool does, and the glass-topped boxes are useful,\r\nas it is not then necessary to open a box and disinter a delicate\r\nfossil from its matrix in order to look at it. Add a good strong pocket\r\nlens, such as may be bought for half-a-crown, and your equipment will\r\nbe complete. If you intend to study any particular district, get the\r\nsheets published by the Geological Survey. These will give you, on a\r\nlarge scale, the minute geology of the neighbourhood, the succession\r\nof rocks, faults, outcrops, &c. In fact, you may save yourself a world\r\nof trouble by thus preparing yourself a week or so before you make\r\nyour geological excursion. The pith of these remarks applies with\r\nequal force if you purpose, first of all, to examine the neighbourhood\r\nin which you live. Don't do so until you have read all that has been\r\nwritten about it, and examined all the available maps and sections.\r\nThis advice however, applies more particularly to _geological_\r\nexamination of strata. If you are bent chiefly on _palæontological_\r\ninvestigation, that is, on the study of _fossils_, perhaps it will be\r\nbest just to read any published remarks you may have access to, and\r\nthen boldly take the field for yourself. In addition to a hammer, we\r\nwould advise the young student to take a good narrow-pointed steel\r\nchisel, and a putty-knife. The former is very useful for working round,\r\nand eventually obtaining, any fossil that may have been weathered into\r\nrelief. The latter is equally serviceable for clayey rocks or shales.\r\n\r\nIn arranging the spoils of these excursions for the cabinet, a little\r\ncare and taste are required. We will suppose you to possess one of\r\nthose many-drawered cabinets which can now be obtained so cheaply.\r\nBegin at the bottom, so that the lowest drawers represent the\r\nlowest-seated and oldest rocks, and the uppermost the most recent. If\r\npossible, have an _additional_ cabinet for _local_ geology, and never\r\nforget that the first duty of a collector is to have his own district\r\nwell represented! A compass of a few miles will, in most cases,\r\nenable him to get a store of fossils or minerals which cannot well be\r\nobtained elsewhere. Supposing he is desirous of having the geological\r\nsystems well represented, he can always do so by the insertion of such\r\nparagraphs as those which appear in the Exchange columns of 'Science\r\nGossip.' It is by well and thoroughly working separate localities in\r\nthis fashion that the science of geology is best advanced. You hear\r\na good deal about the \"missing links,\" and it is an accepted fact\r\nthat we, perhaps, do not know a tithe of the organic remains that\r\nformerly enjoyed life. Who knows, therefore, but that if you exhaust\r\nyour district by the assiduous collection of fossils, you may not come\r\nacross such new forms as may settle many moot points in ancient and\r\nmodern natural history? The genuine love of geological study is always\r\npretty fairly manifested in a student's cabinet. Science, like charity,\r\nbegins at home. It impels a man to seek and explain that which is\r\nnearest to him, before he attempts the elucidation of what really lies\r\nin another man's territory!\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary that the student should waste time in the field\r\nabout naming or trying to remember the names of fossils, &c., on the\r\nspot. That can be best done at home, and the pleasure of \"collecting\"\r\ncan thus be spun to its longest length. Box them, pack them well (or\r\nall your labour is lost), and name them at home. Or supposing you do\r\nnot possess books which can assist you in nomenclature, carry your\r\nfossils or minerals, just as you found them, to the nearest and best\r\nlocal museum, where you will be sure to see the majority of them in\r\ntheir proper places and with their proper names. Copy these, and when\r\nyou arrange your specimens in the cabinet, either get printed cards\r\nwith the following headings--\r\n\r\n  _Genus______________________________________\r\n\r\n  _Species____________________________________\r\n\r\n  _Formation__________________________________\r\n\r\n  _Locality___________________________________\r\n\r\n(which can always be obtained at a cheap rate from the London dealers),\r\nor else set to work and copy them yourself in a good plain hand, so\r\nthat there is no mistaking what you write. As far as possible, in\r\neach drawer or drawers representing a geological formation, arrange\r\nyour specimens in natural-history order--the lowest organisms first,\r\ngradually ascending to the higher. By doing so, you present geological\r\nand zoological relationship, so that they can be taken in at a glance.\r\nYou further make yourself acquainted with the relations of the fossils\r\nin a way you never would have done, had you been content to huddle\r\nthem together in any fashion, so that you had them all together.\r\nGlass-topped boxes, again, are very useful in the cabinet, especially\r\nfor delicate or fragile fossils, as people are so ready to take them in\r\ntheir hands when they are shown, little thinking how soon a cherished\r\nrarity may be destroyed, never to be replaced. Pasteboard trays, made\r\nof stiff green paper, squared by the student according to size, can\r\nalso be so arranged as that the drawer may be entirely filled, and so\r\nthe danger of shaking the contents about may be removed. Each tray of\r\nfossils ought to have the above-mentioned label fastened down in such a\r\nway as that it cannot by accident get changed by removal.\r\n\r\nThe spring and summer time are fast approaching, and we know of nothing\r\nthat will so much assist in their rational enjoyment as the adoption\r\nof some study in natural science. Botany, entomology, ornithology,\r\ngeology, are all health-affording, nature-loving pursuits. We have\r\npassed some of the very happiest moments of our lives in solitary\r\nquarries, or on green hill-sides,\r\n\r\n  \"The world forgetting, by the world forgot!\"\r\n\r\nThere, amid the wreck of former creations, and with the glory of\r\nthe present one around us, we have yielded to the delicious sense\r\nof reverie, such as can only be begotten under such circumstances.\r\nThe shady side of the quarry has screened us from solar heat, and,\r\nwhilst the air has been melodious with a thousand voices, we have made\r\npersonal acquaintance with the numerous objects of God's creation,\r\nanimals and plants. How apt are the thoughts of the poet Crabbe, and\r\nhow well do they convey the feeling of the young geologist in such\r\nplaces:\r\n\r\n  \"It is a lonely place, and at the side\r\n  Rises a mountain rock in rugged pride;\r\n  And in that rock are shapes of shells, and forms\r\n  Of creatures in old worlds, and nameless worms;\r\n  Whole generations lived and died, ere man,\r\n  A worm of other class, to crawl began.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nBONES.\r\n\r\nBy Edward Fentone Elwin, Caius College.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy is it that the students of Osteology are so few in number? It is\r\na branch of science which offers a wide field for original research,\r\nand one in which at every step one's interest must get more and more\r\nengrossed. It is a branch of science in which a sufficient portion\r\nof its elements may be rapidly learned, in order to set the student\r\nfairly on his road. The barriers which surround it are few: that is to\r\nsay, the _technical_ barriers are few. Many people who want to occupy\r\nthemselves with scientific study are deterred, because of the feeling\r\nthat there are so many laborious preliminaries to be gone through\r\nbefore they can begin to take any real pleasure in the pursuit. Now,\r\nin Osteology it is true that a wide and really almost unexplored field\r\nlies open before one, but the equipments necessary to fit one for\r\none's journey are easily attained. The first step is to get thoroughly\r\nacquainted with some one typical specimen, as a standard of comparison\r\nfor all future work. It matters little what species is taken;\r\nwhichever comes most convenient. Some familiar mammal of fair size is\r\nthe best. The dog is as good as any, and easy to obtain. There ought\r\nnever to be any real difficulty in getting a suitable specimen. If\r\nexpense is no object, the simplest way is to get a preparation, set up\r\nso as readily to take to pieces, at any of the bone-preservers' shops\r\nin London. One like this costs only a moderate sum, and is, of course,\r\nthe least trouble, although the manner in which professionals prepare\r\ntheir bones is not altogether satisfactory. But we may regard this\r\nas something in the light of a luxury; and it is not hard to prepare\r\none's own specimens, provided we do not mind a little manipulation with\r\nunsavoury objects. I have given hints as to the best method by which\r\nthis may be done in various pages of 'Science-Gossip.'[A] Of course,\r\nas one's work gets on, one needs further specimens, but I do not think\r\nthat anyone who keeps his eyes open need be at a loss in this matter.\r\nI have picked up several admirable bones ready cleaned by the wind and\r\nweather, and many slightly damaged ones may be got at naturalists'\r\nshops for small sums, which are almost as good as the perfect ones for\r\nan observer's purposes. Even single and isolated bones are often very\r\ninstructive.\r\n\r\n[A] 'Science-Gossip' for 1873, p. 39; for 1874, p. 226.\r\n\r\nBut the first main point is that of getting the forms, peculiarities,\r\nnames, and positions of the bones of one skeleton fully impressed on\r\nthe student's mind. As to the books which are to help him to do this,\r\nit is very hard to know what to recommend. As far as I know, there is\r\nno really luminous book on osteology in existence. So far as learning\r\nthe names and peculiarities of the bones, nothing could be better\r\nor more to the purpose than Flower's 'Osteology of the Mammalia';\r\nbut this treats only of one class, and does not get beyond technical\r\ndescription. The first and second volumes of Owen's 'Comparative\r\nAnatomy of Vertebrates' fill the gap the best of any, and yet these are\r\nby no means what we really want. There is a good deal about bones in\r\nHuxley's 'Anatomy of Vertebrated Animals,' but in such a fragmentary\r\nand scattered form as to be of little use. The fact is, the field is\r\nyet open for an Osteological Manual. Much has been written on the\r\nsubject. Pages of precise and accurate description, beautiful and\r\nartistic sheets of plates of bones without number, can be seen in\r\nany scientific library. But this is only half the matter. We want\r\nto advance a step farther. It is the relation between structure and\r\nfunction which needs working out.\r\n\r\nWhen a new bone finds its way into the student's hands, he observes\r\nsome peculiarity in shape or structure in which it differs from the\r\nbones he is already acquainted with; the question naturally occurs to\r\nhim, Why does this bone assume one shape in one animal, and in another\r\nis modified into a different form? He may look in vain in his books for\r\nan answer to his query. And yet it is points like these which, in my\r\nopinion, make up the true science of Osteology. It is through careful,\r\nconstant, and intelligent observation, that these enigmas are to be\r\nsolved. Observation, indoors and out; close attention to the habits of\r\nthe animal in question, on the one hand, and careful consideration of\r\nits anatomical peculiarities, on the other.\r\n\r\nLet me give an instance of this, first of all taking it as an axiom\r\nthat everything has been done with a purpose. Take, then, the skull\r\nof a crocodile. What do we find? The orbits of the eyes, the nasal\r\norifice, the passages leading to the auditory apparatus, all situated\r\non a plane, along the upper flattened surface of the head. What,\r\nthen, is the cause of this? Palpably to allow the crocodile to remain\r\nsubmerged in the water, with its nose, eyes, and ears just above the\r\nsurface to warn him of the approach of enemies or prey, and the rest of\r\nhis carcase securely hidden beneath the waters.\r\n\r\nTake another instance. Observe the habits of a mole. With what\r\nrapidity it burrows underground, shovelling away the earth with its\r\nfore feet. Then look at its skeleton. We find just what we should\r\nhave expected. The bones of its fore legs of astounding strength and\r\nbreadth, furnished with deep grooves, which, together with its sternum\r\nor breastbone, which is furnished with a keel almost like that of the\r\nsternum of a bird, afford attachment to the powerful muscles. Its hind\r\nlegs, being simply needed for locomotion, are of the normal size. So,\r\nalso, with the birds. The size of the keel of the sternum varies in\r\nproportion to the powers of flight which each species requires, for it\r\nis to the broad surfaces of the sternum that the great wing-muscles are\r\nattached. Take the skeleton of a hummingbird, which spends its life\r\nalmost upon the wing. We find there a keel of so vast a size, that the\r\nremainder of the skeleton is reduced to insignificance in comparison.\r\nOf course, these instances that I have given are all of the most\r\nobvious nature, but they serve to show my meaning; and the same line of\r\nreasoning can, I am sure, be extended to all the more minute points in\r\nosteological structure.\r\n\r\nIn these researches, one is soon struck by the fact that in the\r\nmodifications in various bones, or sets of bones, in accordance with\r\nthe habits of each animal, the original type is never departed from,\r\nonly modified. See, for example, the paddle of a whale. More like the\r\nfin of a fish in general appearance, and yet the same set of bones\r\nwhich are found in the arm of a man, are again found in an adapted form\r\nin the paddle of the whale. So, also, the fore leg of a horse preserves\r\nthe same general plan. What is generally called its knee is in reality\r\nits wrist. It is there that we find the little group of bones which\r\nforms the carpus. All below it answers to our hand--a hand consisting\r\nof one finger.\r\n\r\nTake even a wider instance. Compare the arm of a man and the wing\r\nof a bird. Still greater adaptations have taken place, and yet the\r\nplan remains the same. We still find the clavicle or collar-bone, the\r\nscapula or shoulder-blade, the humerus, ulna, and radius, answering to\r\nthe same bones of our arm, a small carpus or wrist, and finally the\r\nphalanges or fingers, simplified and lengthened and anchylosed to form\r\nbut one series of bone, with the exception of a rudimentary thumb. It\r\nis not uncommon to find a rudimentary bone like this which in some\r\nallied species is fully developed. The leg of the horse again gives us\r\na very striking example of this. There is, so to speak, only a single\r\nfinger, but we find, one on each side of this single finger, two small\r\nbones, commonly known only as splint-bones. These are the rudimentary\r\ntraces of the same finger-bones, which in the rhinoceros are fully\r\ndeveloped.\r\n\r\nNow Osteology abounds in wonderful forms of structure like these. It\r\nis a study pregnant with pleasurable results, and is a real profitable\r\nstudy, and one in which each fresh student may do real solid work.\r\nIt is all the little facts observed by naturalists from time to\r\ntime all over the world, which on being collected together form the\r\nnucleus of knowledge; for indeed all the scientific knowledge which\r\nwe possess is little more than a nucleus, with which we are supplied.\r\nThe mere collector of curious objects in no way furthers science.\r\nPlenty of people have amassed beautiful collections of insects\r\ninteresting in their way, but of very transient interest if it goes no\r\nfarther. The collector possibly knows nothing at all of the wonderful\r\ninternal structure of the animals he preserves. His insects are to\r\nhim simply a mosaic--a collection of pretty works of art. So also\r\nthe shell-collector--for I cannot call such a one as I describe a\r\nconchologist--has often, I believe, the most vague ideas of what kind\r\nof animals they were that dwelt in the cases he so carefully treasures,\r\nand his collection is consequently of a dubious worth to him. Now,\r\nto those who study the anatomy of the mollusc as well as its shell,\r\nsuch a collection is full of the deepest interest. He has learnt\r\nfrom his dissections that the habits of every variety of mollusc are\r\naccompanied by a variety of structure, which occasions a variety in\r\nthe shape of the case which envelopes it. It all blends together, and\r\nforms a harmonious whole. With a real love for science, as doubtless\r\nsome of these collectors have, one is sorry to see so much time and\r\nmoney wasted on a pursuit which in their hands yields no fruit of any\r\nworth. The work of the mere collector can only be classed with that\r\nof the compiler of a stamp-album. Whereas, collections of natural\r\nobjects, combined with intelligent study, are invaluable and almost\r\nindispensable to the naturalist.\r\n\r\nIn Mr. Chivers's note on Preserving Animals, No. 117 of\r\n'Science-Gossip,' the following passage occurs:--\"The skeleton must\r\nbe put in an airy place to dry, but not in the sun or near the fire,\r\nas that will turn the bones a bad colour.\" I cannot comprehend how\r\nthis idea should have arisen. Perhaps the most indispensable assistant\r\nto the skeleton preparer is that very sun which Mr. Chivers warns\r\nhim against. The bleaching power of the rays of a hot summer sun is\r\nastounding, and bones of the most inferior colour can rapidly be turned\r\nto a beautiful white by this means. It is for want of time and care in\r\nfollowing out this method that the professional skeleton preparers in\r\nLondon resort to the aid of lime, which, although it makes them white,\r\nis terribly detrimental to the bones themselves. In a smoky city like\r\nLondon, the principle of sun-bleaching would be hard to follow; but so\r\ngreat is its value, that more than once I have had valuable specimens\r\nsent down to me in the country, by a comparative anatomist in London,\r\nto undergo a course of sun-bleaching; and a specimen which I have\r\nreceived stained and blotched, I have returned of a beautiful uniform\r\nwhite, a change entirely due to that sun which we are told to beware of.\r\n\r\nThe question, How are skeletons to be prepared? is one which is\r\nrepeatedly asked. People desire a method by which with little trouble\r\nthe flesh may be removed from a specimen, and a beautiful skeleton of\r\nivory whiteness left standing in its natural position. I can assure all\r\nsuch inquirers that this cannot be accomplished by any method at all.\r\nThe art of preparing bones is a long, elaborate, and difficult one, and\r\nhe who wishes to become a proficient in it must be alike regardless to\r\nthe most unpleasant odours, and to handling the most repulsive objects.\r\nMr. Chivers's receipt for the maceration of specimens is about the best\r\nwhich one could have, only I should not advise so frequent a change\r\nof the water. What is needed is as rapid a decomposition of the flesh\r\nas is possible, and then the cleaning of the skeleton just before the\r\nharder ligaments have also dissolved. But this requires very careful\r\nwatching, and with the utmost pains it is almost impossible to get a\r\nskeleton entirely connected by its own ligaments.\r\n\r\nAnother point which must be taken into consideration is this: What use\r\nis to be made of the specimens after they are prepared? Are they for\r\npurposes of real study, or simply as curious objects to look at? If the\r\nlatter is the purpose, I must confess I do not think they are worth the\r\ntrouble of preparing. If the former is the object for which they are\r\nintended, then I think no care or pains are thrown away. But for the\r\nreal student of Osteology the separated bones, as a rule, are far more\r\nvaluable than those which are connected. He needs one or two set up\r\nfor purposes of reference, but the great bulk of his specimens should\r\nbe separate bones. Osteology is one of the most delightful branches\r\nof comparative anatomy, and one not very hard to master. Let anyone\r\ntry the experiment by getting together a few bones--and those from the\r\nrabbit or the partridge we have had for dinner are by no means to be\r\ndespised--and then, by purchasing Flower's 'Osteology of the Mammalia,'\r\nwhich is a cheap and first-rate book, he will learn what the study\r\nof the skeleton really is. And then let him be on the look-out for\r\nspecimens of all kinds on all occasions, bringing home all suitable\r\nobjects he meets with in his walks, however unsavoury they may be, and\r\nhe will be astonished to find how many specimens he will get together\r\nin the course of a year. I have now myself upwards of seventy skulls of\r\nvarious kinds, with often the rest of the skeleton as well, the greater\r\npart of which were gradually collected, by keeping constantly on the\r\nwatch for them, within a year and a half.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nBIRDS' EGGS.\r\n\r\nBy Thomas Southwell, F.Z.S., etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nI can imagine no branch of natural history more _fascinating_ in its\r\nnature, or more calculated to attract the attention of the young,\r\nthan the study of the nests and eggs of birds; the beauty of the\r\nstructure of the one, and of the form and colour of the others, cannot\r\nfail to excite wonder and admiration; and the interest thus excited,\r\nif rightly directed, may, and indeed has, in many instances, led to\r\nthe development of that passionate love for all nature's works, that\r\ncareful and patient spirit of investigation, and that deep love for\r\ntruth which should all be characteristics of the true naturalist.\r\nWho can look back upon the days, perhaps long passed away, when as a\r\nschool-boy he wandered through the woods and fields, almost every step\r\nunfolding to him some new wonder, some fresh beauty--glimpses of a\r\nworld of wonders only waiting to be explored--who can look back to such\r\na time without feeling that in those wanderings there dawned upon his\r\nmind a source of happiness which in its purity and intensity ranks\r\nhigh amongst those earthly pleasures we are permitted to enjoy, and\r\nwhich has influenced him for good in all the changes which have since\r\ncome upon him, lightening the captivity of the sick room, and adding\r\nfresh brightness to the enjoyments of health.\r\n\r\nBetween the true naturalist and the mere \"collector\" there is a wide\r\ngap, and I trust that none for whom I am writing will allow themselves\r\nto drift into the latter class; the incalculable mischief wrought by\r\nthose who assist in the extermination of rare and local species by\r\nbuying up every egg of a certain species which can be obtained, for\r\nthe mere purpose of exchange, cannot be too much deprecated, and I\r\nhope that none of my readers will be so guilty; to them the pleasures\r\nof watching the nesting habits of the bird, the diligent search and\r\nthe successful find are unknown; the eggs in such a cabinet are mere\r\negg-shells, and not objects pregnant with interest, recalling many a\r\nhappy ramble, and many a hardly-earned reward in the discovery of facts\r\nand habits before unknown. Every naturalist must be more or less a\r\ncollector, but the naturalist should always be careful of drifting into\r\nthe collector, his note-book and his telescope should be his constant\r\nand harmless companions.\r\n\r\nWhen the writer first commenced his collection, the mode of preparing\r\nthe specimens for the cabinet was very rude indeed, and the method of\r\narranging equally bad; he is sorry to say the popular books upon the\r\nsubject which he has seen do not present any very great improvement; in\r\ngiving the results of his own experience, and the plan pursued by the\r\nmost distinguished oologists of the day, who have kindly allowed him to\r\nexplain the methods they adopt, he will, he trusts, save not only much\r\nuseless labour, but many valuable specimens.\r\n\r\nBefore saying a word as to preparing specimens for the cabinet, I wish\r\nto impress upon the young oologist the absolute necessity for using\r\nthe greatest care and diligence in order satisfactorily to identify,\r\nbeyond possibility of doubt, every specimen, before he admits it to\r\nhis collection. Without such precautions, what might otherwise be\r\na valuable collection is absolutely worthless; and it is better to\r\nhave a small collection of authentic specimens than a much larger\r\none, the history of which is not perfectly satisfactory; in fact, it\r\nis a good rule to banish from the cabinet every egg which is open\r\nto the slightest doubt. There are some eggs which, when mixed, the\r\nmost experienced oologist will find it impossible to separate with\r\ncertainty, and which cannot be identified when once they are removed\r\nfrom the nest.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties in the way of authentication are by no means slight,\r\nbut space will not allow me to dwell upon them; the most ready means,\r\nhowever, is that of watching the old bird to the nest, although even\r\nin this, as the collector will find by experience, there is a certain\r\nliability to error. In collecting abroad it will be found absolutely\r\nnecessary (however reluctant we may be to sacrifice life) to procure\r\none of the parents with the nest and eggs. As we are writing for\r\nbeginners at home, we trust such a measure will rarely be necessary;\r\nbut that an accurate knowledge of the appearance of the bird, its\r\nnesting habits, the situation, and the materials of which the nest is\r\ncomposed, will be found amply sufficient to identify the eggs of our\r\nfamiliar birds. This knowledge of course is only to be obtained by\r\npatient and long observation; but it is just by such means that the\r\nstudent obtains the practical insight into the habits and peculiarities\r\nof the objects of his study, together with the careful and exact method\r\nof recording his observations, which eventually enables him to take his\r\nplace amongst the more severely scientific naturalists whom he desires\r\nto emulate.\r\n\r\nI will first describe the tools required, and then proceed to the mode\r\nof using them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4. Fig. 5. Drills for perforating Birds' Eggs.]\r\n\r\nFigs. 4 and 5 are drills used for making the hole in the side of the\r\negg, from which the contents are discharged by means of the blowpipe,\r\nFig. 6. Fig. 4 has a steel point, brass ferrule, and ebony handle, and\r\nmay be used for eggs up to the size of the wood-pigeon's; Fig. 5 is\r\nall steel, the handle octagonal, to give a firm hold to the fingers in\r\nturning it, and may be used for eggs from the size of the wood-pigeon's\r\nupwards. The points of both are finely cut like the teeth of a file,\r\nas shown in the woodcut. The blowpipe, Fig. 6, is about 5-1/2 inches\r\nin length (measured along the curve), and is made of German silver,\r\nwhich from its cleanliness, lightness, and freedom from corrosion, will\r\nbe found the most suitable: it should be light and tapering, and with\r\na ring at the upper end to prevent it from slipping out of the mouth\r\nwhen used. A piece of thin wire, Fig. 7, should be kept in the tube\r\nwhen not in use, to prevent it from becoming stopped up by any foreign\r\nsubstance. A common jeweller's blowpipe may be used for large eggs,\r\nsuch as those of gulls and ducks. Fig. 8 is a small glass bulb-tube,\r\nwhich may be used for sucking out the contents of very delicate eggs,\r\nand other purposes, which will be explained hereafter. The small drill\r\nand blowpipe may be carried inside the cover of the note-books.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6. German-silver Blowpipe.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7. Wire for unstopping ditto.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8. Glass Bulb-tube, for sucking eggs.]\r\n\r\nThe sooner a fresh egg is emptied of its contents after it is taken\r\nfrom the nest the better. This should be done by making a hole in the\r\nside with the drill (choosing the side which is least conspicuously\r\nmarked) by working it gently backwards and forwards between the\r\nforefinger and thumb, and taking great care not to press too heavily,\r\nor the egg will burst with the outward pressure of the drill: a very\r\nsmall hole will generally be found sufficient. When this is done,\r\ntake the egg in the left hand with the hole _downwards_, introduce\r\nthe blowpipe, by blowing gently through which, the contents may soon\r\nbe forced out. Water should then be introduced by means of a syringe\r\nor the bulb-tube, which may be filled and blown into the egg. After\r\nshaking, blow the water out again by means of the blowpipe; repeat this\r\ntill the egg is free from any remains of the yolk or white: should\r\nthe egg not be quite fresh, it will require more washing. Care should\r\nbe taken to wet the surface of the egg as little as possible. After\r\nwashing the interior, lay the egg, with the hole downwards, on a pad of\r\nblotting-paper to drain till it is quite dry. Should the eggs be much\r\nincubated, I should recommend that the old birds be left to complete\r\ntheir labour of love; but a valuable egg may be made available by\r\ncarefully cutting a piece out of the side, extracting the young one,\r\nand, after replacing the piece of shell with strong gum-water, covering\r\nthe join with a slip of very thin silk-paper, which may be tinted so as\r\nto resemble the egg, and will scarcely be noticed. This is a very rough\r\nway of proceeding, however, compared with Professor Newton's plan of\r\ngumming several thicknesses of fine paper over the side of the egg to\r\nstrengthen it, through which the hole is drilled: the young chick is\r\nthen cut into small pieces by means of suitable instruments, and the\r\npieces removed with others:[B] the paper is then damped and removed\r\nfrom the egg.\r\n\r\n[B] \"Suggestions for forming Collections of Birds' Eggs.\" By Professor\r\nNewton. Written for the Smithsonian Institution of Washington, and\r\nrepublished by Newman, 9, Devonshire Street, Bishopsgate.\r\n\r\nThe old plan of making two holes in the side of the egg is very\r\nobjectionable: a hole at each end is still worse. Many eggs would be\r\ncompletely spoiled by washing; none improved. There is no necessity\r\nfor washing at all, except such as are very filthy, and these eggs\r\n(which you may be sure are not fresh) are not such as should be\r\nwillingly accepted as specimens: a _little_ dirt only adds to the\r\nnatural appearance of the egg; washing in most cases certainly does\r\nnot. Never use varnish to the shell; it imparts a gloss which is not\r\nnatural: all eggs should not have a polished appearance like those of\r\nthe Woodpecker. Should the yolk be dried to the side of the egg, a\r\nsolution of carbonate of soda should be introduced: let it remain till\r\nthe contents are softened, then blow out and wash well. Great care must\r\nbe taken not to allow the solution to come in contact with the outside\r\nof the egg. Having blown the egg, and allowed the inside to become\r\nquite dry, procure some thin silk-paper gummed on one side, and with a\r\nharness-maker's punch cut out a number of little tickets suitable to\r\nthe size of the hole in the egg, moisten one of these, and place it\r\nwith the gum side downwards over the hole, so as to quite cover it;\r\ncover the ticket with a coat of varnish, which will render it air-tight\r\nand prevent its being affected by moisture. The egg thus treated will\r\nhave all the appearance of a perfect specimen, and if kept from the\r\nlight will suffer very little from fading.\r\n\r\nThe note-book has been mentioned. This should be a constant companion;\r\nnothing should be left to memory. When an egg is taken, a temporary\r\npencil number should at once be placed upon it, and this number should\r\ncorrespond with the number attached to an entry in the note-book,\r\ndescribing the nest (if not removed), its situation, number of eggs,\r\nday of month, and any other particular of interest. When the egg is\r\nready for the cabinet, as much of this information (certainly, name,\r\ndate, and locality) should be indelibly marked upon it as conveniently\r\ncan be done (neatly, of course, and on the under side); also the number\r\nreferring to the collector's general list of his collection, into\r\nwhich the important parts of the entry from the note-book should be\r\ncopied. Never trust to gummed labels, which are always liable to come\r\noff; by writing the necessary particulars upon the egg itself there\r\ncan be no confusion or mistake. Most collectors have their own plan of\r\ncataloguing their collection. I have adopted the following, which I\r\nfind to answer very well. Obtain a blank paper book the size of common\r\nletter-paper, rule a horizontal line across the centre of each page,\r\nand make a complete list of British birds, placing only two names on\r\neach page, one at the head of each division, prefixing a progressive\r\nnumber to each name: this number is to agree with that marked on the\r\negg of the species named. Then follow the locality whence the egg came,\r\nby whom taken (if not by myself), or how it came into my possession,\r\nwith any other particular worthy of note. With all eggs received in\r\nexchange or otherwise, this note should, if possible, be obtained in\r\nthe handwriting of the person from whom they are received, and the\r\nslip on which it is written be affixed in the book under the number.\r\nWhen specimens of the eggs of the same species are obtained from\r\nvarious localities, those from each locality should be distinguished by\r\na letter prefixed to the number. The plan will be better understood by\r\nreferring to the following extract:\r\n\r\n  62. Great Sedge-warbler (_Sylvia turtoides_, Meyer).\r\n\r\n  62. Received of ----, from the cabinet of Mr. ----.\r\n\r\n  a62. Taken by ----, a servant of ----, on the banks of the river\r\n  Tougreep, near Valkenswaard, in the south of Holland,\r\n  on the 9th of June, 1855. The birds may be heard a long\r\n  way off by their incessant \"Kara, Kara, Kara.\" A few\r\n  years ago not one was to be found near Valkenswaard.\r\n\r\n    A. B----\r\n\r\n  b62. Bought at Antwerp in August, 1865. X/\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  118. Mealy Red-pole (_Fringilla borealis_, Tem.).\r\n\r\n  118.

The birds were very\r\n  plentiful, and only one species seen, which appears\r\n  quite identical with that which visits England every\r\n  winter.\r\n\r\n    C. D. E----\r\n\r\nBy means of these entries, and the corresponding number on the egg,\r\nmistakes are impossible, and the name and history of each egg would be\r\nquite as well known to a stranger as to the possessor. It needs not to\r\nbe said that this catalogue is replete with the deepest interest to\r\nits compiler. In it he sees the record of many a holiday trip and many\r\na successful find. Some of the entries in my own register--the earliest\r\ndate back five-and-twenty years--are memorials of companions long since\r\ndead, or separated by rolling oceans, but on whose early friendship it\r\nis a pleasure to dwell.\r\n\r\nNothing can be more vexatious and disappointing than the receipt of a\r\nbox of valuable eggs in a smashed or injured condition from want of\r\ncare or knowledge of the proper method of packing. A simple method\r\nis recommended by Professor Newton, which, from experience, I can\r\nconfidently recommend:--Roll each egg in tow, wool, or some elastic\r\nmaterial, and pack them closely in a stout box, leaving no vacant\r\nplace for them to shake; or a layer of soft material may be placed at\r\nthe bottom of the box, and upon it a layer of eggs, each one wrapped\r\nloosely in old newspaper; upon this another layer of wool or moss, then\r\nagain eggs, and packing alternately until the box is quite full. Bran,\r\nsawdust, &c., should never be used; and it should be ascertained that\r\nthe box is quite filled, so that no shaking or settlement can occur.\r\n\r\nAlmost every collector has his own plan for constructing his cabinet,\r\nand displaying his collection. The beginner, if left to himself, will\r\nfind it a matter of no small difficulty, and many will be the changes\r\nbefore he arrives at one at all satisfactory. Mr. Osbert Salvin has\r\ninvented a plan which I think as near perfection as it is possible\r\nto arrive at, and through his kindness I am enabled to give a brief\r\ndescription of it. In the first place, his cabinets are so constructed\r\nthat the drawers, of different depths, are interchangeable. This is\r\neffected by placing the runners, which carry the drawers, at a fixed\r\ndistance from each other and making the depth of each drawer a multiple\r\nof the distance between the runners. For example: if the runners are\r\nthree-quarters of an inch off each other, then let the drawers be\r\n1-1/2, 2-1/4, 3, 3-3/4, 4-1/2, &c., inches deep. All these drawers\r\nwill be perfectly interchangeable, and a drawer deep enough to hold an\r\nostrich's egg can in a few moments be placed amongst those containing\r\nwarblers': every requirement of expansion and rearrangement will be\r\nvastly facilitated, involving none of those radical changes so worrying\r\nto a collector.[C] Mr. Salvin's plan of arranging the eggs is equally\r\nsimple, and admits of any amount of change with very little trouble.\r\nEach drawer is divided longitudinally by thin slips of wood into three\r\nor more parts, about 4 to 6 inches across, as may be convenient; a\r\nnumber of sliding stages are then constructed of cardboard, by cutting\r\nthe cardboard half through, at exactly the width of the partition,\r\nand bending the sides down to raise the stage to the required height.\r\nA section of one of these stages will be seen in Fig. 9, and the\r\narrangement in the drawer at Fig. 10. A number of oval holes are then\r\nto be cut by hand, or with a wadding-punch of suitable size (altered\r\nin shape by hammering), and a thin layer of cotton-wool gummed on the\r\nupper surface of the stage: the holes, of course, should be suitable\r\nin size to the egg they are intended to receive. Between these stages\r\nsliding partitions must be placed: these should be made of just\r\nsufficient height that the horizontal part may fit closely on the wool,\r\nas shown at Fig. 9. These partitions should be made of thin wood for\r\nthe upright part, along which a horizontal strip of cardboard is to be\r\nfastened with glue, on which is to be placed a label bearing the name\r\nof the species of egg displayed on the stage, as seen in Fig. 10. All\r\nthis will be better understood by referring to the figures.\r\n\r\n[C] Of course, cabinets thus constructed will be found equally\r\nconvenient for collections of bird-skins, fossils, &c.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9. Section of Sliding Stage.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10. Cabinet Drawer on Mr. Salvin's plan.]\r\n\r\nFig. 9 represents a longitudinal section of one of the stages in its\r\nplace, with the ends of the two next; 1, showing the cardboard stage;\r\n2, the cotton-wool; 3, the sliding partition; and 4, the horizontal\r\nslip of cardboard to carry the label.\r\n\r\nFig. 10 represents one of the drawers on Mr. Salvin's plan: it is\r\ndivided into three parts (1, 2, 3) by fixed partitions. No. 1 is\r\nrepresented empty; No. 2 with the specimens arranged; No. 3 with two\r\nstages and two of the movable partitions.\r\n\r\nThis may appear very complicated at first sight, but a few trials\r\nwill be sufficient to master the details, and the result will be very\r\nbeautiful if neatly carried out. The eggs are well shown, not liable to\r\nfall out of their places, and it is very little trouble to alter the\r\narrangement, every part being movable. Each drawer should be covered by\r\na sheet of glass to exclude dust.\r\n\r\nMr. Salvin's cabinet is an excellent one for holding the nests of\r\nbirds, which should be removed with as little damage as possible, and\r\nplaced in the drawers, under cover of glass. Great care must be taken\r\nto keep them free from moth, to which they are very liable; for this\r\npurpose they should be dressed with the solution of corrosive sublimate.\r\n\r\nThe young collector should remember that what is worth doing at all is\r\nworth doing well, and that the care bestowed upon his cabinet is not\r\nlabour in vain; habits of exactness and precision of arrangement are\r\nabsolutely necessary if he would make the best use of the materials\r\nwhich come in his way; and, above all, never let him degenerate into\r\nthe mere collector: his collection should be for use, and not merely\r\nornamental.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nBUTTERFLIES AND MOTHS.\r\n\r\nBy Dr. Henry Knaggs.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe collector of Lepidoptera who aspires to success must read the\r\nbook of nature as he runs. If he have not the wit to note and turn to\r\naccount each little fact which may come under his observation, neither\r\nhe nor science will be the better for his collecting. He should,\r\nwhenever he makes a capture, _know the reason why_, or he will never\r\nmake a successful hunter. He should be ever on the alert: his motto,\r\n_nunquam dormio_.\r\n\r\nSome collect for profit, others for pastime; but the aim of our\r\nreaders, I take it, is not only to acquire a collection of really\r\ngood specimens, but also at the same time to improve their minds; and\r\nthe best way of effecting this purpose is to hunt the perfect insect,\r\nnot so much for itself as for the sake of the golden eggs, which,\r\nwith proper care and attention, will in due course yield the most\r\nsatisfactory results in the shape of bred specimens.\r\n\r\nThis being the case, and space being limited, it seems best to simply\r\ntouch upon the preliminary stages of insect existence, pointing out as\r\nwe go those methods of collecting and preserving which experience has\r\nshown to be the most successful.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt but that egg-hunting is a very profitable\r\noccupation, and far more remunerative than most people dream of,\r\nparticularly as a means of acquiring the Sphinges, Bombyces, and\r\nPseudo-bombyces. Eggs, speaking generally, are to be found on the\r\nplants to which the various species are attached; and a knowledge of\r\nthe time during which the species remains in the egg state, as well as\r\nthe appearance of the eggs as deposited in nature, should if possible\r\nbe acquired previous to proceeding to hunt. The most practical way of\r\nascertaining the food and time is to watch the parent insect in the act\r\nof depositing her ova; but when the plant has been thus discovered, the\r\nbest way is to capture her, and induce her to lay at our home. When\r\neggs are inconspicuous, of small dimensions, or artfully concealed, the\r\nuse of a magnifying glass is invaluable.\r\n\r\nEggs may be preserved by plunging them in boiling water or piercing\r\nthem with a very fine needle, or they may have their contents squeezed\r\nout and be refilled by means of a fine blowpipe, with some coagulable\r\ntinted fluid; but the shells themselves, after the escape of the larvæ,\r\nform, when mounted, beautiful objects for the microscope.\r\n\r\nThe three most successful plans of obtaining caterpillars are\r\nsearching, beating, and sweeping. The first requires good eyesight and\r\na certain amount of preparatory knowledge; the others are a sort of\r\nhappy-go-lucky way of collecting, useful enough and profitable in their\r\nway, but affording a very limited scope for the exercise of the wits.\r\nIn searching for larvæ, the chief thing is to observe the indications\r\nof their presence. A mutilated leaf, a roughened bark, a tumid twig,\r\na sickly plant, an unexpanded bud, an abortive flower, or a windfall\r\nfruit, should at once set us thinking as to the cause; or, again, the\r\nwebs, the silken threads, the burrowings and trails, or the cast-off\r\nskins of larvæ, may first call our attention to their proximity. Of\r\ncourse, larvæ may be found on almost all plants, as well as in the\r\nbark, stems, or wood of many; but the collector should fortify himself\r\nwith a knowledge of what each plant is likely to produce, and hunt\r\naccordingly; for though indiscriminate collecting may sometimes be\r\nsuccessful, it does not tend to improve the intellectual powers.\r\n\r\nBeating is the more applicable method of working trees and bushes. It\r\nis carried out by jarring the larvæ from their positions by the aid of\r\na stick or pole, in such a manner that they will fall into an inverted\r\numbrella, or net; or a sheet may be spread beneath for their reception.\r\nSweeping with a strong net, passed from side to side with a mower-like\r\nmovement, is better adapted for working low ground-herbage. The\r\numbrella net, shown in Fig. 11, is, perhaps, the best for the purpose.\r\nIt is constructed by hinging two lengths of jack-spring on two pieces\r\nof brass, and adapting them to the stick of the net, the upper piece of\r\nbrass being fixed, the lower movable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11. Umbrella Net.]\r\n\r\nWhen captured, larvæ should be transferred to chip boxes, or else to\r\nfinely and freely perforated tins, the latter better preserving the\r\nfood. A very handy box for the purpose is formed by fitting a second\r\nlid on to the bottom of a chip box, and then cutting from the second\r\nlid and bottom a hole, as shown in Fig. 12 (2); larvæ may then be\r\ninserted through the hole; but when the lid is shifted round, and the\r\nholes are not opposite, of course there will be no opening, as in Fig.\r\n12 (1), and the contents are secured from escape.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12. Collecting Box for Larvæ.]\r\n\r\nLarva preserving is carried out by first killing, and then squeezing\r\nand extracting the contents through the anal orifice by means of a\r\ncrochet hook.\r\n\r\nWhen this has been done, the skin is inflated, but not to such an\r\nextent as to distend the segments, and is kept thus inflated while it\r\nis being dried in a heated metal chamber. Afterwards, if the colours\r\nare observed to have faded, they may be cautiously restored by the\r\napplication of paint. These objects, mounted on suitable artificial\r\nleaves, are then ready for the cabinet.\r\n\r\nChrysalis collecting is conducted according to the situation of the\r\nobject sought. Some are to be found in the chinks of bark or under\r\nloose bark, which may be detached by means of a powerful lever. Some\r\nare suspended from trees, bushes, copings, hanging head downwards,\r\nor girded by silken threads to low plants or walls; others are to be\r\nfound in the stems or trunks of their food-plants; many are concealed\r\nin cocoons of more or less perfect construction, others again amongst\r\nfallen leaves, but the majority are to be met with under the surface of\r\nthe ground; in which case we shall have to dig for them by the aid of a\r\ntrowel or broad chisel. The best situations for subterranean pupæ are\r\nopen park-like fields, borders of streams, open spaces in fir woods,\r\nand they are usually situated within a foot or so of the tree trunks,\r\nat the depth of two or three inches, though sometimes considerably\r\ndeeper. Of course both larvæ and pupæ of aquatic species will have to\r\nbe sought for in their element, among the plants they frequent.\r\n\r\nChrysalis preserving is a simple matter: the pupæ may be killed by\r\nplunging them into hot water or by baking; frequently, however, we\r\nfind that the natural polish disappears with death, and this may be\r\nrestored by varnishing. It is advisable that the cocoons also, where\r\npracticable, should be preserved, to give a notion of their appearance\r\nin nature.\r\n\r\nMoths and butterflies may be sought for at rest or on the wing. They\r\nmay be disturbed from their hiding places or they may be attracted by\r\nvarious alluring baits.\r\n\r\nAt rest on stems of grasses and other plants butterflies may be taken\r\non dull, sunless days; but it requires some experience to detect a\r\nbutterfly with its wings raised up over its back: the little \"Blues\"\r\nmay thus be freely boxed in their localities. Again, such butterflies\r\nas hybernate may be found in old sheds and outhouses, or under stacks.\r\n\r\nMoths may be taken at rest on tree trunks, palings, and walls, or\r\namongst foliage and ground herbage. Some species are to be freely\r\ncaptured in this way after their evening flight is over. Of course, for\r\nevening work, a lantern to assist our vision will be indispensable.\r\n\r\nOn the wing, some butterflies are exceedingly active, others\r\ncomparatively sluggish; some fly high, others low. In hunting them, the\r\nchief points to be remembered are not to alarm, but rather cautiously\r\nto stalk our game, and strike, when we have an opportunity, with\r\nprecision. It is important also to avoid throwing a shadow over them,\r\nand it is a good plan to get to windward of them--anything like flurry\r\nwill be fatal to success.\r\n\r\nMoths which fly by day may be chased in the same manner, but some\r\nmay be observed disporting themselves round trees; these must be\r\nwatched, and netted as they now and then descend. Others fly at a\r\nvery low altitude, and are only brought into the field of vision by\r\nour assumption of the recumbent position. At night again, though we\r\nwatch for anything stirring the air, among the trees or the herbage,\r\nour tactics are somewhat modified; for, if the insect be of whitish\r\ncolour, we should so place ourselves that its form will stand boldly\r\nout against a mass of dark foliage, whereas, if it be dingy in hue, we\r\nmust take the sky for our background.\r\n\r\nDisturbing insects, and thus causing them to start forth, and so render\r\nthemselves visible, is another method of collecting. This is carried\r\nout in various ways.\r\n\r\nFirst, the occupants of high trees may be expelled by jarring the\r\ntrunk with a heavily loaded mallet, or by thwacking the trunk with a\r\nlong hazel stick; but a sharp look-out must be kept, for some sham\r\ndeath, and fall plump down, while others make off as fast as they can.\r\nOther plans are to pelt the trees with stones, or pump on them with a\r\npowerful garden engine, or beat them with a long pole; and of all tress\r\nthe most profitable for this purpose is the yew; though firs, oaks,\r\nbeeches, and other trees are not to be despised.\r\n\r\nFor beating bushes there is nothing better than a walking-stick, and\r\nfor low herbage a long switch passed quickly from side to side with a\r\ntapping movement is best adapted. The tenants of tree trunks may be\r\ndisturbed by brushing the surface with a leafy little bough, or, better\r\nstill, by the use of a strong fan, with which a powerful blast may be\r\ndriven, the net being held in such a position as to intercept such\r\ninsects as are blown off.\r\n\r\nThatch-beating in the autumn is a very profitable employment,\r\nparticularly in the matter of _Depressariæ_. Sweeping need only be\r\nmentioned here, for moths collected by the process are anything but\r\nperfect insects.\r\n\r\nThere are various methods of attracting moths and butterflies. The\r\nfirst is effected by confining a virgin female in a muslin cage, the\r\nframe of which may be very readily formed by bending three pieces of\r\ncane into circles, and fixing these together at right angles, as shown\r\nin Fig. 13. When this baited cage is placed in a favourable position,\r\nand the weather is propitious for the flight of the males, the latter\r\nwill, in some cases, congregate, and may be freely captured.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13. Frame of Cage for Virgin Lepidoptera.]\r\n\r\nThen, the food-plant of the species is an attraction at which we stand\r\nthe best chance of procuring impregnated females.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14. Lantern and Net.]\r\n\r\nVarious kinds of blooms possess alluring qualities for insects: of\r\nthese, sallow and ivy are the greatest favourites with collectors.\r\nThey should be worked after dusk by means of a lantern and net; but\r\nthe combination of a lantern fixed to a long stick, with a shallow net\r\nbeneath and a little in advance of it, as shown in the cut, is the\r\napparatus best adapted for the purpose; the object of the net being\r\nto intercept any insects which may happen to fall under the stimulus\r\nof light. These attractions should be first well searched over, and\r\nafterwards, a sheet (split if necessary) having been carefully spread\r\nbelow the bushes, a gentle shaking should be administered. Besides\r\nthese blossoms, heather, ragwort, bugloss, catchfly, bramble,\r\nvarious grasses, and a vast number of other flowers, are wonderfully\r\nattractive. In working patches of bloom we should remain stationary and\r\nstrike as the visitors arrive. Again, over-ripe fruit, the juicy buds\r\nof certain trees, sap exuding from wounds in trees, are all more or\r\nless attractive. The secretion of aphides, commonly called honeydew,\r\nobservable in hot seasons on the leaves of nettles and various other\r\nplants and trees, is also well worth attention, and is at times very\r\nproductive of insects.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15. Net for sugaring.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 16. Box with linen joints.]\r\n\r\nSugaring is the next attraction, and a very important one it is.\r\n\"Sugar\" may be prepared by boiling up equal quantities of coarse\r\n\"foots\" sugar and treacle in a sufficient quantity of stale beer,\r\na small quantity of rum being added previous to use, and also, if\r\nconsidered advisable, a flavouring of jargonelle pears, anise-seed, or\r\nginger-grass. This mixture should be applied by means of a small paint\r\nbrush to the trunks of trees, to foliage, flowers, tufts of grass, or\r\nindeed to any object which may present a suitable surface; for in some\r\nlocalities we are put to shift to know where to spread our sweets. This\r\noperation should be performed just before dusk, and soon afterwards\r\nthe baited spots should be visited and, by the aid of a lantern gently\r\nturned on them, examined, a net being held beneath the while. The\r\nbest form of net for the purpose is formed by socketing two paragon\r\nwires into a Y-piece and connecting their diverging extremities by a\r\npiece of catgut, as shown in Fig. 15. The catgut, being flexible, will\r\nadapt itself (see the dotted line) to the surface of a tree trunk when\r\npressed against it. With regard to insects captured at sugar, they\r\nare usually remarkably quiet, and may be boxed without difficulty,\r\nand, with a few exceptions, may be conveyed home in the boxes, care\r\nbeing taken to let each have a separate apartment. The boxes should be\r\nstrengthened with strips of linen pasted round the joints, as shown in\r\nFig. 16, otherwise accidents may occur, particularly on wet evenings\r\nor on rough ground. The skittish individuals may be best captured by\r\nmeans of the sugaring drum, of which a cut is given in Fig. 17. This\r\napparatus consists of a cylinder, one end of which is covered with\r\ngauze, the other provided with a circular valve, which works in a slit.\r\nFor use, the valve is opened and the cylinder placed over the insect,\r\nwhich naturally flies towards the gauze; then the valve is closed, the\r\ncorked piston, shown at the upper part of the cut, placed against it,\r\nthe valve re-opened, the piston pushed up to the gauze, the insect\r\npinned through the gauze, and the piston withdrawn with the insect\r\ntransfixed to it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig 17. Sugaring Drum.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 18. Cyanide Bottle and Ferrule.]\r\n\r\nLight is another most profitable means of attracting. The simplest way\r\nis to place a powerful moderator lamp upon a table in front of an open\r\nwindow which faces a good locality, and then wait net in hand for our\r\nvisitors, which usually make their appearance late in the evening, and\r\ncontinue to arrive until the small hours. Those who prefer it can use\r\nthe American moth-trap, which is self-acting, detaining such insects\r\nas may enter its portals, or those who can afford the space may fit\r\nup a room on the same principle. Street lamps are very profitable\r\ncertain localities, and amply reward the collector who perseveringly\r\nand minutely examines them. The apparatus depicted in Fig. 18 is very\r\nuseful for taking off such insects as may be on the glass of the lamp:\r\nit consists of a cyanide bottle attached by a ferrule to the end of a\r\nsufficiently long stick. When placed over an insect, stupefaction is\r\nquickly produced. A net of the shape represented in Fig. 19 is also\r\nvery useful for getting at the various parts of the lamp.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 19. Lamp Net.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 20. Chloroform Bottle.]\r\n\r\nThe best methods of stupefying and killing insects on the field is the\r\ncyanide bottle, prepared by placing alternate layers of cyanide of\r\npotassium and blotting-paper in the bottom of a wide-mouthed bottle,\r\nthe mouth of which is accurately stopped with a cover, which is better\r\nfor the purpose than a bung. The chloroform bottle, which is generally\r\nmade with a little nipple, through which the fluid flows slowly out,\r\nand covered with a screw-tap, as in the cut 20, is also handy. The\r\nchloroform should be dropped over perforations in the box containing\r\nour patient, these perforations having been previously made by a few\r\nstabs of a penknife. After the fluid is dropped, our thumb should cover\r\nit, when the vapour will quickly enter, and the inmate speedily become\r\ninsensible. Afterwards the _coup de grâce_ may be given to the insect\r\nby pricking it under the thorax with the nib of a steel pen dipped in\r\na saturated solution of oxalic acid. If we are smokers, a puff of\r\ntobacco may be blown into the box with like result. If we are destitute\r\nof any apparatus, and brimstone lucifers for the purpose of suffocating\r\nour captures under an inverted tumbler cannot be obtained at some\r\nroadside inn, we must fall back on the barbarous practice of pinching\r\nthe thoraces of such as cannot be carried home in boxes. At home we\r\nshall find the laurel jar and ammonia bottle the most useful. The\r\nformer is made by partially filling a large wide-mouthed bottle or jar\r\nwith cut and bruised dry leaves of young laurel: if any dampness hang\r\nabout them, we shall have the mortification of seeing our specimens\r\nbecome mildewed. The latter consists in adding a few lumps of carbonate\r\nof ammonia, or some drops of strong liquid ammonia, on a sponge, to the\r\nbottle in which our captures, with each box lid slightly opened, have\r\nbeen placed. But it must be borne well in mind, firstly, that ammonia\r\nis injurious to the colours of most green insects; and secondly, that\r\nif the specimens be not well aired after having been thus killed, the\r\npins with which they are transfixed will become brittle and break.\r\nInsects should be left in the ammonia for several hours, and are then\r\nin the most delightful condition for setting out.\r\n\r\nTo pin an insect properly is a most important procedure. The moth, if\r\nof moderate dimensions may be rested or held between the thumb and fore\r\nfinger of the left hand, while the corresponding digits of the right\r\nhand operate by steadily pushing a pin through the thorax, bringing\r\nit out between the hind pair of coxæ until sufficient of the pin is\r\nexposed beneath to steady the insect in the cabinet The direction of\r\nthe pin should be perpendicular when the insect is viewed from the\r\nfront, as in Fig. 21; but a lateral view should show the pin slightly\r\nslanting forwards, as in Fig. 22. Pins made for the purpose in numerous\r\nsizes are sold by Mr. Cooke, of New Oxford Street.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 21. Front View of properly pinned Insect.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 22. Side View of ditto.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 23. Cork Saddle for setting out Insects.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 24. Braces for setting out.]\r\n\r\nSetting out moths and butterflies is an operation which, if skilfully\r\nperformed, adds much to the beauty of the future specimens. The method\r\nof setting most popular is carried out by means of saddles and braces.\r\nThese so-called saddles are pieces of cork rounded as in the sectional\r\nfigure, a groove being cut out for the reception of the bodies of the\r\ninsects: they are generally strengthened by a strip of wood, upon\r\nwhich they are glued. Braces are wedge-shaped pieces of card or thick\r\nnote-paper, the thick end strengthened, if necessary, with a disc\r\nof card fixed by shoemakers' paste, and pierced with a pin through\r\nit, as shown in Fig. 24. The mode of application of these appliances\r\nis beautifully shown in Fig. 26[D]. But before these straps can be\r\napplied, the wings must first be got into position by means of the\r\nsetting needle and setting bristle, which are thus manipulated (the\r\nsetting bristle, by the way, being formed by fixing a cat's whisker and\r\na pin into a piece of cork, at the angle shown in Fig. 25):--After the\r\ninsect is straightly pinned upon the saddle, and the legs, antennæ,\r\nand, if necessary, the tongue, got into position, the left fore-wing is\r\nto be pushed or tilted into its place by means of the setting needle,\r\nwhich is merely a darning needle with a handle; and simultaneously it\r\nis to be held down by the bristle; then a small brace should be applied\r\nto the costa of the fore wing. Next the hind wing should in like\r\nmanner be adjusted, and as many braces as are considered necessary to\r\nkeep the wings in their place should be added. Lastly, the right side\r\nof the insect should be treated in a similar way.\r\n\r\n[D] Figs. 26 and 27 have been kindly lent by Messrs. Reeve & Co.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 25. Setting Bristle.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 26. Moth set out on Cork Saddle.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 27. Four-strap setting.]\r\n\r\nA very useful mode of setting, invaluable when we are destitute of\r\nsaddles, is known as \"four-strap\" setting, and is well explained in\r\nFig. 27. In this case the lower straps are first put into such a\r\nposition, that when the insect is placed over them the middle of each\r\nof the costæ will rest upon them; then the wings are got into position,\r\nand the second pair of straps are applied over the wings, the latter\r\nretaining their position through the elasticity of their costæ: two\r\nmore straps are generally added to secure the outer borders of the\r\nwings, as shown in the drawing; but these, though advantageous, are\r\nnot absolutely necessary. The saddles, with their contents, should be\r\nkept in a drying house, which is a box adapted for their reception, and\r\nfreely ventilated, until the specimens are thoroughly dry, when the\r\nlatter may be cautiously removed, and transferred to the collection.\r\n\r\nTo preserve our collection from decay, considerable care and attention\r\nis necessary. In the first place no insect which is in the least degree\r\nsuspected of being affected by mites, or mould, or grease, should on\r\nany account be admitted to our collections. It is best to be on the\r\nsafe side and submit every insect received from correspondents, whether\r\nmity or not, to quarantine, by which is meant their detention for a few\r\nweeks in a box the atmosphere of which is impregnated with some vapour\r\ndestructive to insect life; such as that of benzole. Our own specimens\r\nwe should kyanize by touching the bodies of each with a camel's-hair\r\nbrush dipped in a solution of bichloride of mercury of the strength six\r\ngrains to the ounce of spirits of wine,--no stronger.\r\n\r\nAs for mould, it is best destroyed by the application of phænic\r\nor carbolic acid, mixed with three parts of ether or spirit. As\r\npreventives, the specimens should be kyanized as above. Caution in the\r\nuse of laurel as a killing agent must be exercised, and the collection\r\nmust be kept in a dry room.\r\n\r\nGrease may be removed by soaking the insects in pure rectified naphtha\r\nor benzole, even by boiling them in it if necessary. When the bodies\r\nonly are greasy, they may be broken off, numbered, and treated as\r\nabove. After the grease is thoroughly softened, the insects should\r\nbe covered up in powdered pipeclay or French chalk, which may be\r\nsubsequently removed by means of a small sable brush. As a precaution\r\nagainst grease, it is advisable to remove the contents of the abdomina\r\nby slitting up the latter beneath with a finely pointed pair of\r\nscissors before they are thoroughly dry, and packing the cavities with\r\ncotton wool. The males, especially of such species as have internal\r\nfeeding larvæ, should be thus treated.\r\n\r\nSome prefer to keep their collections in well-made store boxes, which\r\npossess many advantages over the cabinet; for example, they may be kept\r\nlike books in a bookcase, the upright position rendering the contents\r\nless liable to the attacks of mites; they are more readily referred to,\r\nand are more portable, and they admit of our gradually expanding our\r\ncollections to any extent. Cabinets, on the other hand, are preferred\r\nby many, for the reasons that they are compact and generally form\r\na handsome article of furniture; moreover, good cabinets are made\r\nentirely of mahogany, which is the best wood for the purpose; deal, and\r\nother woods containing resinous matter, having a decidedly injurious\r\neffect on the specimens. As a preservative, there is, after all,\r\nperhaps nothing better than camphor; but it should be used sparingly,\r\nor its tendency will be to cause greasiness of the specimens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nBEETLES.\r\n\r\nBy E. C. Rye, F.Z.S., etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe general rules, so ably expounded by Dr. Knaggs in his instructions\r\nfor collecting _Lepidoptera_, as to constant alertness and making \"the\r\nreason why\" the starting-point of investigation, apply with equal force\r\nto the collector of _Coleoptera_, and need not be here recapitulated.\r\nBut they do not, in the instance of the latter, require generally to\r\nbe observed, except as to the perfect state of beetles; for, owing\r\nto the hidden earlier conditions of life of most of those insects,\r\nand to the long period during which these conditions exist, it is but\r\nseldom that the pursuit of rearing them, so universally and profitably\r\nadopted by the Lepidopterist, is found of much use to the collector\r\nof beetles. And this is very much to be regretted; because, in the\r\nmajority of cases, if the latter succeed in rearing a beetle from its\r\nearliest stage, and keep proper notes of its appearance and habits,\r\nhe will probably be adding to the general stock of knowledge, as the\r\nlives of comparatively few, even of the commonest species, are recorded\r\nfrom the beginning. It may be, also, in addition to the reasons above\r\nmentioned, for the usual want of success attending the rearing of\r\nbeetle larvæ, that the fact of bred specimens being frequently (from\r\nthe artificial conditions attending their development, and from their\r\nnot being allowed that length of time which, in a state of nature,\r\nthey require after their final change before they are ready to take an\r\nactive part in their last stage of life) not nearly so good as those\r\ntaken at large, militates considerably against the more general use\r\nof this method of adding to a collection. In this respect, of course,\r\nthe Lepidopterist is actuated by precisely opposite motives; as for\r\nhim, a bred specimen is immeasurably superior to one captured. And the\r\nfact of so few beetle larvæ being known at all, or, if known, only\r\nto the possessor of somewhat rare books, renders it very likely that\r\na mere collector, finding a considerable expenditure of patience and\r\ntrouble result in the rearing of a species of which he could at any\r\ntime readily procure any number of specimens, may very probably abandon\r\nrearing for the future.\r\n\r\nThese observations, however, are not in the least intended to dissuade\r\nanyone from breeding or endeavouring to breed beetles. On the contrary,\r\nit is obvious from them that it is precisely by attending to these\r\nearlier stages that the earnest student (novice or expert) has the\r\nmost chance of distinguishing himself, on account of the more open\r\nfield for discovery. And in the instance of many small, and especially\r\ngregarious, beetles, breeding from the larvæ is frequently very easy,\r\nif only the substances (fungus, rotten wood, roots, stems of plants,\r\n&c.) containing them be carefully left in precisely the state as when\r\nfound, and be exposed to the same atmospheric or other important\r\nconditions. In fact, to ensure success and good specimens, it is best\r\nthat in their early stages beetles should be \"let alone severely.\"\r\n\r\nIt may be here observed that we have been lately in this country\r\nindebted to the minute observations and great tact of some of our best\r\nstudents of _Micro-Lepidoptera_ (in which branch of entomology we are\r\nsecond to none in Europe) for some most interesting additions to our\r\nknowledge of habits, and for long series of beetles usually rare in\r\ncollections.\r\n\r\nDismissing then the earlier stages of beetles, the following\r\nobservations will apply only to the imago, or \"beetle proper.\" And here\r\nI would repeat how evident it is that the knowledge of \"the reason\r\nwhy\" is especially indispensable to the beetle collector, judging from\r\nthe extreme rarity of the occurrence of any new or valuable insect\r\nin the stores of a mere random collector or a beginner. For him, no\r\nold hand detects an equivalent to _Daplidice_ or _Lathonia_ in his\r\nduplicate boxes; whereas, among Lepidopterists, \"school-boy's luck\" is\r\nproverbial. I can give no reason for this statement, founded on my own\r\n(by no means trifling) experience in the way of examining specimens.\r\nAnd in this idea I think I am corroborated by the very great rarity in\r\nold collections and records of many species now universally common;\r\nthe directions in older manuals, as to looking under stones, on walls,\r\npaths, &c., pretty clearly showing that the majority of captures in\r\nthe olden time were what are now irreverently designed as \"flukes.\"\r\nStill, it is astonishing to what good account a sharp observer may turn\r\nthese casual meetings, often to him resulting in the discovery of \"the\r\nreason why\" as to the particular species accidentally found, and to the\r\ncorrelative increase of his collection. And, apart from captures during\r\ncollecting expeditions, good things will at times occur to the alert\r\nentomologist: one, for instance, who will startle his friends in the\r\nstreets by suddenly swooping with his hat after an atom flying in the\r\nsunshine, or who is not too proud to pick up another, racing on the hot\r\npavement, during those days of early spring, when the insect myriads,\r\nrevelling in warmth and light, after their long winters durance, may be\r\nseen madly dashing about, even in towns: on such a day, for instance,\r\nas that whereon a certain well-known doctor among the beetles found\r\nthat living carabideous gem _Anchomenus sexpunctatus_, far from its\r\nnative _Sphagnum_ and heath, wandering on the flagstones of the W.C.\r\ndistrict.\r\n\r\nBut, before referring to special modes of hunting, it may be as well\r\nto mention the _instrumenta belli_ required for the equipment of the\r\nColeopterist in this country. These are but few, and of the simplest\r\nkind; indeed, in entomology, as in the gentle art of angling, it\r\nis often the most roughly accoutred that secures the best basket.\r\nThe umbrella net, figured at p. 47, used both for beating into and\r\nsweeping, cannot be dispensed with, and a beating stick can be cut\r\nout of the nearest hedge. The net itself should be of fine \"cheese\r\ncloth,\" or some strong fabric that allows the passage of air, but not\r\nof beetles; otherwise, if of too close a fibre, it is apt to \"bag\"\r\nwith the inclosed air, and reject its contents during the operation\r\nof sweeping. The net being of course used with the right hand, its\r\nleft top edge especially bears the brunt of the attendant friction,\r\nand gets soon worn; it is consequently advisable to have an outer\r\nstrip of stout \"leather-cloth\" sewn strongly over the rim there for\r\nsome little distance, extending that protection also to the right top\r\nedge, though not for so long a space. The curved handle of the stick\r\nshould be sawn off as soon as possible; it frequently catches in the\r\npockets of the sweeper, causing a jerk to the net, and dispersal of its\r\ncontents. For a similar reason, the ferruled apex may well be removed.\r\nSome collectors keep the sharp cutting edge of the spring sides of the\r\nnet uncovered, sewing the net itself to holes drilled at intervals on\r\nthe lower side of the springs: a net of this kind cuts very close,\r\nand where there is much herbage soon gets full of fragments, taking a\r\nlong time to examine. It will be found handy if the bag of the net be\r\ncut to a point from the front towards the handle side: this causes the\r\ncontents to gravitate to the bottom, as far as possible from the point\r\nwhere the rim meets the substance swept.\r\n\r\nA common umbrella (easily slung by a stout string over the back when\r\nnot in use) is an admirable (some think, superior) substitute for\r\nthis net, as it can be held up higher by the ferrule, and tall bushes\r\nand trees (of which the branches nearer the top are usually most\r\nproductive) can be beaten into it with more certainty of their beetle\r\ncontents being caught. The steel frames will be found in the way when\r\nthe beetles are being bottled; consequently, a good large gingham may\r\nbe consecrated to collecting, and its inside (not merely the outer\r\nribs) covered all over up to the middle (leaving no aperture there if\r\npossible) with thin white calico, stitched _over_ the frame.\r\n\r\nAnother good form of net for sweeping or dragging in long grass or\r\nherbage, is of the common fishing landing-net description, made of\r\nvery stout wrought-iron or steel wire, either in a simple hoop, if a\r\nmoderate size only be required, or with a single hinge to fold into\r\ntwo, or with three such hinges, folding into four, as may be desired.\r\nI have used one of these four-folding nets for years, and never found\r\nit fail. One end is hammered out flat and perforated, the other forming\r\na male screw (1-1/2 inch long), bent at right angles with the body\r\nof the frame, passes through the hole, and fits into a female screw\r\nin a strong and long ferrule, fixed in the usual way to the end of\r\na stout oaken walking-stick. As the power exerted in sweeping with\r\nsuch a net is great, and the action continuous, the simple screw\r\nis not enough, and a small screw hole is drilled right through the\r\nferrule and the screw end of the net; a small thumb-screw, in shape\r\nlike an old-fashioned clock key, going transversely through both, and\r\neffectually hindering lateral displacement. The framework of the net\r\nand the ferrule are better made of the same metal, because, if made\r\nof two metals of different density, the stronger soon wears away the\r\nweaker; and the stick must be inserted deeply into the ferrule, and\r\nheld on with _two_ deep pins or small screws on opposite sides (not on\r\nthe same level, however, as the wood is in that case weakened), one\r\nbeing insufficient to stand the strain. The net, of the same substance\r\nas that above mentioned, is made with a loose \"hem\" to slip on the\r\nframe before screwing it in the ferrule. A leather-cloth edging all\r\nround is advisable, and the bag should be cut long enough to prevent\r\nthe possibility of the contents jerking out. Another very good plan for\r\nsecuring the frame to the ferrule is to have both ends of it soldered\r\ntogether into a deep square-sided plug, fitting into a corresponding\r\nsquare hole in the ferrule. The small cross-screw or pin is here also\r\nto be used; but the angles of the plug naturally keep a much tighter\r\nhold than the worm of a screw. Such a frame as this cannot, of course,\r\nbe folded.\r\n\r\nFor water beetles, a similar net to that last mentioned is effective,\r\nbut it should be stouter and with a flat front, for dredging closely\r\nagainst the sides and bottoms of ponds. The best substance for its\r\nbag is fine sampler canvas; and a very large, stout bamboo cane is at\r\nonce light and strong for its stick. To avoid friction the bag may be\r\naffixed to small wire rings let into holes on the lower edge of the\r\nframe, or running on the frame itself.\r\n\r\nA sieve is one of the most remunerative implements, and may be procured\r\neither simple or folding. It consists of a stout wire-framed circle,\r\nconnected by a strong linen band, six inches deep, with the bottom of\r\nan ordinary wire sieve, the meshes of which are wide enough to allow\r\nany beetle to pass through. Leaves, grass, flood refuse, ants' nests\r\nmaterials, cut grass, seaweed, haystack and other _débris_, are roughly\r\nshaken in this over a sheet of brown paper, which should invariably\r\nform part of a Coleopterist's apparatus. A stout piece of double\r\nwaterproof material may be substituted; and, in marsh collecting, must\r\nbe used as a kneeling pad.\r\n\r\nFor ordinary bark collecting, a strong ripping chisel (of which the\r\nblade is well collared, so as not to slip) is as useful a tool as\r\ncan be procured; but for _real_ tree working, no ordinarily portable\r\ninstrument is thoroughly effective. Light steel hammers with a lever\r\nspike may delude the collector; but a woodman's axe, a saw, a pickaxe\r\nor crowbar, will often be found not too strong. For cutting tufts,\r\n&c., a strong garden pruning-knife is good, and an old fixed-handled\r\ndinner-knife (carried in a sheath) better. For holding the results of\r\nthe operation of these instruments, the collector needs but one or two\r\ncollecting bottles--one rather small and circular, of as clear and\r\nstrong glass (_not_ cast) as can be got, with a wide mouth and flat\r\nbottom. Its neck should not slope, but be of even width, or the cork\r\nwill often get out of itself. This cork should be a deep one, and\r\nbe perforated longitudinally by a stout and large round quill, the\r\nbottom of which should be level with the bottom of the cork, the top\r\nprojecting some inch and a half, with the upper orifice not cut off\r\nstraight, but slightly sloped diagonally, so as more easily to scoop\r\nup beetles from the net or hand. It is closed with an _accurately\r\nfitting_, soft, wooden plug, rather longer than the quill, reaching\r\nexactly to the bottom of it, but with its top projecting above the top\r\nof the quill, and broader than it, so as to be easily pulled out by\r\nthe teeth when the hands are occupied. The bottle should be secured\r\nby stout twine to the buttonhole, enough play being left for it to\r\nreach the net in any ordinary position. I usually secure the external\r\njunction of quill and cork with red sealing-wax, and have more than\r\nonce found the bright red catch my eye when I have lost my bottle.\r\n[N.B. This loss will always happen to every collector; generally after\r\na peculiarly lucky day's work: so use the string-preventive.] The body\r\nof the bottle may usefully be half covered with white paper gummed on.\r\nA few stout, plain glass tubes, papered in like way, and with plain\r\ncorks, should be carried for special captures; and a cyanide bottle,[E]\r\nas mentioned at p. 57, or one containing bruised and shredded young\r\nlaurel shoots, will be found useful for safely bringing home larger\r\nspecies, or such as would devour their fellow-captives. When put into\r\nthese, beetles almost instantly die and become rigid, needing a stay\r\nof two days or so to become relaxed, in which condition they will then\r\nsafely remain for a considerable period. In the first collecting bottle\r\na piece of muslin should be put, to give the contents foothold: these\r\nare brought home alive, and killed by bodily immersion in boiling\r\nwater, after which they are placed on blotting paper to drain off\r\nsuperfluous moisture.\r\n\r\n[E] \"Killing bottles,\" containing cyanide of potassium under a layer of\r\ngypsum, may be bought at most natural-history apparatus dealers, and\r\nare useful as relaxing dépôts.\r\n\r\nGood things should always, when practicable, be set out at once, as the\r\npubescence is apt to get matted if they are consigned for too long a\r\nperiod to the laurel or cyanide bottle; but such as remain unmounted\r\ncan be put in a little muslin bag, and deposited in laurel until a\r\nmore convenient opportunity. Beetles also, when taken in large numbers\r\nduring an expedition into a productive locality, may be collected\r\nindiscriminately into a bottle containing sawdust (sifted to get rid\r\nboth of large pieces and actual dust), slightly alcoholized, or with\r\na small quantity of carbolic acid or cyanide of potassium in it. Each\r\nnight, on reaching home, these will be found to be dead, and they can\r\nthen be transferred to a larger bottle or air-tight tin can, partially\r\nfilled with the same materials and a little carbolic acid to check\r\nundue moisture. Filled up with sawdust, this will travel in safety for\r\nany distance, and almost any time.\r\n\r\nSpecies of moderate size, say up to that of an ordinary _Harpalus_, are\r\nin this country usually mounted on card. Much is to be said both for\r\nand against this practice: it enables the proportions and formation of\r\nlimbs to be well appreciated, and it preserves the specimens securely;\r\nbut there can be no doubt that it prevents an inspection of the under\r\nside, except at the slight trouble of extra manipulation in floating\r\noff in cold water and reversing, and that the gum used clogs the\r\nsmaller portions of the insect that come in contact with it. Specimens\r\nlarger than those mentioned should be pinned through the centre of\r\nthe upper third of the right wing-case (never through the scutellum\r\nor thorax), and the limbs extended in position with pins on a setting\r\nboard, made of a flat strip of cork glued on deal. Both these and the\r\nmounted examples must be left to dry, for a week at least, in the open\r\nair: if the boards are fitted in a frame, they can be reversed (as soon\r\nas the gum is dry in mounted specimens), so that the specimens are\r\nbottom upwards--dust cannot then collect on them, and there is less\r\nchance of mites attacking them. Specimens dry more rapidly in spring\r\nand summer than at any other time, and of course more readily in dry\r\nweather.\r\n\r\nFor mounting specimens, five or six small pieces of the finest and\r\nmost transparent gum tragacanth, or \"gum dragon,\" with rather less\r\nthan the same number of pieces of clear gum arabic, are to be put in\r\na wide-mouthed bottle with about a large wine-glassful of cold water.\r\nIn a short time (twenty-four hours at most) the gum absorbs the fluid\r\nand swells; then add half as much more water, and stir the mixture,\r\nwhich, on being left for another twenty-four hours at most, will be\r\nready for use. The mixture should be dull white, of even texture,\r\nand not quite fluid. Never make a large quantity at one time, or be\r\npersuaded to put _anything_ else into it. Card for mounting should be\r\nthe whitest, smoothest, and best that can be procured. \"Four-sheet\r\nBristol board\" for large specimens, and three-sheet for ordinary use,\r\nare about the proper degrees of thickness. Robersons, of Long Acre,\r\nartists' colourmen, have promised the writer to turn out cardboard of\r\nthis kind with an extra milling, to ensure a good surface. Upon strips\r\nof this card, pinned on a setting board, the insects to be set out are\r\nmounted, one at a time, and not too close to each other, each on a\r\nseparate \"dab\" of the gum, the limbs being duly set out with a fine pin\r\nor needle mounted in a paint-brush stick. A pin with the point very\r\nfinely turned, so as to form a minute hook, is very useful; and for\r\nextremely minute work a \"bead-needle\" is valuable. The gum-brush should\r\nnot be used in setting, but one or two very fine-pointed camel's-hair\r\nbrushes may be found of advantage. Before mounting, reverse the\r\nspecimen on the blotting-paper, and brush out its limbs as far as\r\npracticable with a damp flat brush. Very refractory individuals may\r\nrequire to be gummed on their backs; as soon as the gum is dry, their\r\nlimbs can be more easily got into position, and they can then be gently\r\ndamped off their temporary mount, and treated as above.\r\n\r\nA small pair of brass microscope-forceps, ground or cut to a minute\r\npoint, will often materially assist in getting refractory limbs into\r\nposition. French white liquid glue (not made of shell-lac) is useful\r\nfor fastening down larger specimens, as it is very strong and dries\r\nreadily; and with a very small quantity of it rows of specimens can\r\nquickly and securely be roughly mounted, in the Continental way, which\r\nis preferable in many cases to leaving the insects for a long time\r\nin laurel before setting them out. Such specimens can afterwards, if\r\ndesired, be relaxed by leaving them on damp sand, or in the cyanide or\r\nlaurel bottle, and be then set in the way above indicated.\r\n\r\nCare must be taken, in setting, not to put the specimen lop-sided\r\non the card, or to distort its segments unnaturally by pulling them\r\nout of position, &c., and not to allow gum to lodge anywhere on\r\nthe upper surface. It is easy, soon after a specimen is securely\r\nmounted, to remove with clean water and brush any superfluous gum. In\r\npreparing such insects as are liable to \"run up\" in drying (e.g. the\r\n_Staphylinidæ_), the abdomen should be duly pulled out by a bead-needle\r\ninserted at its apex; and to prevent the contraction of the internal\r\nmuscles in drying, this part may be held with the liquid glue above\r\nmentioned. Usually, by putting these insects as soon as mounted into\r\na box and keeping it closed for a few hours, while the first drying\r\ntakes place, the proper dimensions of the abdomen may be preserved,\r\nand thus the natural facies of the insect retained. The contents of\r\nthe bodies of very large insects may well be removed, either by the\r\nanal orifice, or by an incision on the lower side of the abdomen. The\r\nOil-beetles (_Meloë_) alone require careful stuffing. This is best\r\ndone by separating the entire abdomen from the metathorax, beneath the\r\nelytra, and close to their point of insertion: the body is then easily\r\nemptied and washed out, and may be filled with cut-up wool, which packs\r\nclosely; when gummed on again, the junction is not visible, and the\r\nentire insect preserves its wonderfully obese appearance.\r\n\r\nTo save time, in mounting many specimens, it is better to merely gum\r\nstraight on the strip of card as many specimens as can be managed\r\nat a sitting. The left side of each of these can then be slightly\r\ndamped with clear cold water, and its left limbs set out: when all\r\nare thus done, the first one will be nearly, if not quite, ready to\r\nhave its right side treated in like manner; and so on to the end. Very\r\nrefractory specimens will sometimes require to be even held down with\r\nlittle braces of card on pins, and to have each limb damped and set out\r\nby a separate operation. The card of large specimens will often curl\r\nupwards in drying, owing to the amount of damp: to counteract this,\r\nthe lower face of the card may be washed with a wet brush, just before\r\ngumming its surface.\r\n\r\nBefore putting insects away, when dry, the individual specimens should\r\nbe cut off the strips of card by a straight cut on each side, one at\r\nright angles to the sides in front, and another behind, all (except the\r\nlast) close to the tips of the limbs as set out, so that the whole card\r\nforms a parallelogram. A very little practice will enable the operator\r\nto do this both certainly and quickly. No two individuals (save perhaps\r\na male and female, of whose sexual relations there can be no doubt, or\r\nan example mounted on its back, to show its under side, along with a\r\nmember of the same species) should be allowed to continue on one card;\r\nmuch less should a row be left together. The reason of this is, that in\r\nmany cases species closely resembling each other often get confused;\r\nand it is, moreover, difficult to get a glass of anything but a very\r\nlow power to bear upon all parts of the individuals without injuring\r\nsome of them. Each specimen should have sufficient card left _behind_\r\nit to allow of a glass of high power being passed between it everywhere\r\nand its pin. The pin should perforate the card in the middle of, and\r\nclose to, its hinder margin; and the whole card be lifted three-fourths\r\nup the pin, to keep it from mites and dirt as much as possible. Proper\r\nentomological pins can be obtained of all sizes at the agents of\r\nEdelsten, 17, Silver Street, St. Martin's-le-Grand; also (with all\r\nother apparatus) of any natural-history agent or dealer in London;\r\nsuch as Mr. E. W. Janson, 28, Museum Street, or Cooke, New Oxford\r\nStreet. \"No. 8\" pin is, perhaps, the most useful size. In removing many\r\nspecimens, proper insect forceps will be found handy: these can be\r\nobtained at the two last addresses; or of Buck, cutler, Tottenham Court\r\nRoad.\r\n\r\nSpecimens will occasionally become discoloured with grease, usually\r\nfrom defective drying, though many water beetles and internal feeders,\r\nand most autumn-caught specimens, are specially liable to this defect.\r\nBenzine is an effectual remedy for it and for mites, and can be\r\nliberally applied with a brush. Carbolic or phænic acid, dissolved in\r\nthat fluid (or alone, see p. 64), is an effectual safeguard against\r\nmould from damp; and when in solution with water, this acid has been\r\nfound useful as a wash for card and boxes, which then are not attacked\r\nby mites. To re-card a specimen that has become discoloured (whether\r\nfrom either of these causes, or from age), it is only necessary that\r\nit should be floated in cold water for a few minutes; the insect can\r\nthen be dried, well saturated with benzine, and again mounted, looking\r\nas fresh as ever. But, in re-carding specimens, it is necessary to be\r\nvery careful with such as were originally kept too long in a laurel or\r\ncyanide bottle, as they are apt to become so rotten that a little damp\r\nwill cause a \"solution of continuity.\"\r\n\r\nAs to storing the specimens when quite dry, I can add nothing to the\r\nexcellent observations of Dr. Knaggs, at p. 65; the same remarks\r\napplying with equal force to _Coleoptera_; except, perhaps, that, even\r\nwhen the collector has (and is satisfied with) a cabinet, he is likely,\r\nin proportion to the _real_ work done by him, to establish type-boxes\r\nof all the difficult groups.\r\n\r\nFor the examination of insects, readily manipulated by being pinned\r\nsingly on a square, flat, thick piece of cork or bung, a pocket\r\nglass is, of course, necessary. In this case, the best instrument is\r\nthe cheapest in the long run, whatever its cost; and one by a good\r\nmaker, such as Ross, with modifications of four powers, will suffice\r\nfor any ordinary work. For very small species, a Coddington, of the\r\nclearest definition and highest power attainable, is of immense help.\r\nBut when the collector finds that he needs a compound microscope\r\nto separate species, it is the firm opinion of the present writer\r\nthat that collector had better take to some other pursuit than\r\nstudying _Coleoptera_. To anyone, however, whose researches entail an\r\nexamination of the minute cibarian and other organs of beetles, whether\r\nfor purposes of classification or otherwise, the compound is absolutely\r\nnecessary; though even then the lower powers are usually sufficient.\r\nFor rough dissection, all that is needed are an oculist's very small\r\nlance-headed dissecting-knife and a stout and fine needle. With these,\r\nunder a lens mounted on a little stage to allow the free use of both\r\nhands, much may be done. The writer, however, has seen and used a very\r\npretty (and comparatively inexpensive) dissecting-stand, with various\r\npowers and much latitude of motion, by Ross.\r\n\r\nAfter mentioning that, in sending mounted beetles by post to\r\ncorrespondents, it is far more practical to use a _strong_ box, not too\r\ndeep, to fasten the pins securely, with a layer of manufactured wool in\r\nthe lid (glazed side towards the beetles, so as not to catch limbs),\r\nand to put more wool outside, and write the address and affix the stamp\r\non a label attached, than it is to pack carelessly, write \"With care\"\r\noutside,[F] and then grumble at the post-office because the insects are\r\nbroken,--I think I cannot, with use, say anything more upon beetles in\r\ntheir preserved condition; and I will therefore now give some hints as\r\nto their haunts when alive.\r\n\r\n[F] It is, however, always as well to write \"Insects,\" signifying\r\ncontents that are \"caviare to the million,\" and therefore not likely to\r\nbe appropriated en route.\r\n\r\nTo exhaust the accidental-capture system above alluded to, mention must\r\nfirst be made of sand-pit collecting, a most profitable employment,\r\nespecially in spring and early summer. A clean, straight-sided\r\nsilver-sand pit is the best, and if in or near a wood its attractions\r\nwill be at their highest. Beetles, flying of an evening and by night,\r\ndash against the pit sides and fall to the bottom; others merely crawl\r\nin for shelter, or tumble over the sides, and many seem attracted by\r\nthe mere damp at the bottom or in the corners. Old collectors used\r\nto recommend a sheet spread out to attract insects; and there is no\r\ndoubt that a certain number can be found by such means, just as they\r\ncan be picked up floating on horse-troughs or on ponds. Artificial\r\ntraps exist in the corridors of the Crystal Palace, some half-inclosed\r\ncountry railway stations, and such places; crawling up the windows of\r\nwhich many specimens are to be found. But these can only be considered\r\nas indications of what species occur in the district, as they are\r\nmere stragglers. Deliberately laying traps in sand pits, on commons,\r\n&c., will be found most productive. Small dead animals, fir branches,\r\ndead leaves, &c., can be examined time after time with profit in such\r\nsituations. Burying a stout branch with the bark on, leaving the top\r\nabove the soil, and periodically examining it when damp and nearly\r\nrotten, has been found effective; many insects collecting beneath the\r\nloose wet bark.\r\n\r\nAfter heavy floods, as during severe droughts, beetles may be found\r\nin great profusion; in the former case, by sifting the refuse left by\r\nthe water; in the latter, by diligently examining the damp residuum\r\nof former ponds, and if no damp be found, by even searching below the\r\nsurface where it last occurred.\r\n\r\nThe wet hay, often decayed and mouldy, at the bottoms of stacks, which\r\nbad farmers have placed directly on the ground, will be found to teem\r\nwith beetle-life; as will the margins of dung and vegetable-refuse\r\nheaps, wood-stacks, cut grass, &c.; and many good things may be taken\r\nby gently waving a light gauze net to and fro, just before sunset,\r\nclose to such places, whither the instinct of nature impels the flight\r\nof myriads.\r\n\r\nIn winter, isolated tufts of grass in wet places, on the margins of\r\nstreams, the crests of banks, &c., must be cut close to the ground, and\r\ngently torn in pieces over brown paper. Wherever many insects seem to\r\nbe found, it will in most of these cases be found advisable to sift the\r\nfragments, and bring home the beetles and small stuff unexamined in a\r\nbag with a string at the neck to prevent their escape. Moss should be\r\ntreated in this way, and the layers of black and rotting leaves found\r\nin woods, especially at their outskirts. Beech leaves usually produce\r\nmany species, and the autumn and spring are the best times for hunting\r\nfor them.\r\n\r\nIn winter, also, many species will be found hybernating in grass at the\r\nroots of trees, under bark, &c., in conditions not usual with them at\r\nother times.\r\n\r\nIn autumn, fungi, in woods especially, will be found most productive.\r\n\r\nGeneral sweeping, except during the winter, will always be more or\r\nless remunerative. No general rules can be laid down for this; in a\r\ngood neighbourhood (on chalk or sand, or, better still, in a district\r\nwhere both these soils are found) beetles will swarm almost anywhere\r\nin due season, and the most unlikely-looking spots will frequently be\r\nfound the best in the end. In luxuriant herbage, among low shrubs,\r\nin the close-growing vegetation of hill-sides, the sweeping net may\r\nbe plied with success; but the best way, with all _Phytophaga_ at\r\nleast, is to start with a fixed idea as to catching certain definite\r\nspecies, and then, at the right time, to hunt for such plants as these\r\nare known or supposed to frequent; and, such failing in the district,\r\nto try their allies. Of course, the collector will not fail to sweep\r\nflowers in woods and lanes, whereon, in the hot sunshine, many showy\r\nbeetles bask. Many good things will be found by sweeping under fir\r\ntrees, especially towards evening, and even by night; in many places,\r\nespecially marshes, nocturnal feeders may be secured by the vague use\r\nof this net. By night, also, many species may be found at sugar put on\r\ntrees for moths, and on ivy or sallow-blossom.\r\n\r\nBeating is most productive in early summer, especially in the second\r\nyear's growth of young cuttings in woods; and the oak, hazel, and\r\npoplar will generally yield many species to the tap of the stick.\r\nGood thick, and especially _old_ hedges, must also be always carefully\r\nthrashed into the net; very many good things, otherwise not procurable,\r\nwill reward this toil. Another scheme for getting rare species is to\r\nbeat the tops of trees with a long pole, placing beneath a sheet or\r\ntent covering.\r\n\r\nBreaking away the extreme edges of banks, throwing water on them,\r\ntreading heavily on the margins, diligently examining grass and roots\r\nclose to the water, reeds (especially if cut and on the ground in\r\nheaps), &c., will bring to light great numbers of wet-loving beetles.\r\nWater beetles, pure and simple, must be dragged and dredged for,\r\nespecially round water plants beneath the surface, and along the sides\r\nof ponds, in eddies of running streams, in the moss on stones in them,\r\nand on the stones themselves, &c.\r\n\r\nThe _Coprophaga_ will be found readily in the droppings of various\r\n_Mammalia_, and also in holes bored in the ground beneath, often\r\nto a great depth. An easy and clean way to secure them is to throw\r\ndroppings, ground and all, into water, the beetles coming to the\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nAs to wood beetles, they must be sought for under and in bark, in solid\r\nwood, in decaying branches, and such places; a rule to be remembered\r\nis, that most of these occur at the _tops_ of trees: hence the paucity\r\nof so many species in collections. Indeed, to properly hunt for the\r\nmajority of them, it is necessary to obtain _carte blanche_ and a\r\nladder, if any success be hoped for. Felled trunks are, of course, easy\r\nto manipulate; and their freshly-cut stumps, exuding either resin or a\r\npeculiar and often sweet _mucor_, are very attractive to many beetles,\r\nas is freshly-cut sawdust, and most especially the (to us) fetid and\r\nacrid juice resulting from the attacks of the larva of the Goat-moth.\r\nRotten fruit, &c., are also not to be passed by without examination.\r\nMany small species occur in, or can be obtained from, the topmost twigs\r\nof trees blown down by the wind.\r\n\r\nDead animals, as before mentioned, must be examined, as must the\r\nvegetation and soil near them. A keeper's tree in a wood will always\r\nproduce something for the collector, who need only hold his net\r\nbeneath the gibbeted _feræ_ and bang their hides and bones with\r\nhis beating-stick. During different stages of decomposition and\r\ndesiccation, beetles of widely varied affinities will result from this\r\nmethod of collecting.\r\n\r\nAnts' nests would require a special notice, so productive are they:\r\ntheir material can be sifted and their neighbouring \"runs\" or paths\r\nexamined, traps laid near or on them, and periodically cleared out,\r\n&c. Bees' and wasps' nests also produce good, though fewer species,\r\nand are, moreover, not quite so easy of access. The nests of birds,\r\nespecially if the latter are gregarious, and, indeed, the habitations\r\nof any animals, will be found to harbour many beetles, amongst other\r\ninsects.\r\n\r\nIn gardens, the beetle collector should lay cunning traps of cut grass,\r\ntwigs, planks, bones, &c.; by a periodical examination of which he will\r\nsecure many good things. If there be a hothouse about the premises, it\r\nand its belongings will always act as a bait.\r\n\r\nLarge tracts of waste land and commons, though superficially apparently\r\nunproductive, often contain congregations of good species, in some\r\nlittle oasis of damp or vegetation; moreover, on them several peculiar\r\nbeetles occur. Hills and mountains will often suddenly repay the toil\r\nof the collector, who has despondently worked his way up, turning over\r\nstones, and finding comparatively nothing. The moss, &c., attending the\r\nchannels of any streams in such places should be carefully searched,\r\nand the stones on the top especially not neglected. River banks and\r\nsalt marshes are invariably frequented by good insects, and the very\r\nheaps of seaweed, dry or wet, on the shore harbour countless beetles.\r\nIn such places small sand-loving plants should be pulled up by the\r\nroots, and, with the neighbouring soil, shaken over brown paper. The\r\nsand itself may in many instances be scraped, and burrowing beetles\r\nbrought to light; but if the hunter comes upon a dead fish or bird, a\r\nfull bottle will be his.\r\n\r\nThus it will be seen that almost every locality contains beetles,\r\nif the collector can only detect them (and it may be as well here\r\nto impress on him that it is better to bottle a dubious insect and\r\nexamine it at home, than to reject it for being _apparently_ common).\r\nStill there can be no doubt that certain soils and districts are much\r\nmore productive than others; for instance, most of the midland and\r\nwestern counties, and some of the south-western, are not by any means\r\nso prolific as the eastern, southern, and many parts of the northern\r\ndistricts of Great Britain; clay being the worst of all soils for the\r\nColeopterist.\r\n\r\nThe collector will do well, after a first hurried \"burst\" at all\r\nbeetles that come in his way, to select a special group, and lay\r\nhimself out to work it carefully, buying or borrowing the works\r\nof authorities upon it, and making himself master of the _botany_\r\nconnected with it, if it be a group of plant-frequenting habits. By\r\nsuch a way of working, he will more quickly, though step by step,\r\nacquire a good collection, and a stock of useful knowledge, than by\r\nany other. He will of course keep a register of the date and place of\r\ncapture, and any peculiarity of habit of each insect he takes. Figures\r\nof the date of the year (usually the last two are sufficient), followed\r\nby another set, commencing with 1, will generally be quite enough;\r\ncorresponding entries being made in the first column of a ruled diary.\r\nThese figures may be written in ink on the under side of the card of a\r\nmounted specimen, or on a circular disc of paper, pierced by the pin of\r\none too large to be carded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\nHYMENOPTERA.\r\n\r\nBy John B. Bridgman.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving been asked to give some instructions as to the method of setting\r\nand preserving the aculeate _Hymenoptera_, it is with great pleasure I\r\ncomply, and I hope it may be the means of inducing others to collect\r\nthese insects. To begin at the beginning, it is almost needless to\r\nstate that the females of all of them (a few of the ants excepted)\r\nare furnished with stings, but with very little care one need never\r\nbe stung. As Mrs. Glass says, \"First catch your hare\": so first I\r\nshall give a few instructions where to look for and how to catch these\r\ninsects. All the apparatus necessary is a gauze ring-net, a cyanide\r\nbottle, and a pocket full of small card pill-boxes; the cyanide bottle\r\nis best made by wrapping a small piece of cyanide of potassium in two\r\nor three thicknesses of blotting-paper, tying it round with cotton to\r\nprevent it shaking out, then fixing it to the bottom of a wide-mouthed\r\nflat bottle with sealing-wax, which is made to adhere firmly to the\r\nglass by heating the glass carefully over a lamp, and then corking\r\nit up. The pill-boxes ought to have the tops and bottoms fastened in\r\nwith liquid glue (a preparation of shell-lac). These are all that are\r\nrequired to catch and bring home the game; which is to be looked for\r\nat the flowers of trees, bushes, and plants--one season's experience\r\nwill teach the best, as some species frequent one, some another, and\r\nsome almost all. The flowers I have found the greatest favourites are\r\nsallows, willows, sycamore, holly, blackthorn, bramble, hawkweeds,\r\nragwort, thistles, and umbelliferæ. Some bore in putrescent wood,\r\nand must be looked for on or in the neighbourhood of old posts and\r\npalings; some are to be found flying about dry banks, hard-trodden\r\npathways, on heaths, while old sand pits are favourite places; but\r\nthey should be sought for in any warm, rough, weedy spot; and some may\r\nbe obtained by digging them out of their burrows with a trowel. My\r\nplan of proceeding, after having got one in the net, is to catch hold\r\nof the net so that the insect is inclosed in a sort of sack, I then\r\nuncork the cyanide, and introduce that into the sack, holding the net\r\nfirmly round the neck of the bottle, so that there is no other escape\r\nfor the insect from the net but into the bottle, then gradually work\r\nthe insect into the bottle and close the mouth with several folds of\r\nthe net, watch my opportunity and insert the cork: when the insect is\r\nstupefied, which happens in a few seconds if the bottle is slightly\r\nwarm, I turn it into the pill-box. A word of caution: it is necessary\r\nto be methodical in carrying the boxes. I always keep the empty ones in\r\nmy right-hand pocket, and the filled ones in the left-hand one, as, if\r\nthey are carried sometimes one way, sometimes another, sooner or later\r\na previously filled one will be opened to put an insect in, which will\r\nresult in the former tenant speedily making room for the new comer; and\r\nmy experience has been, if you do lose anything it is generally your\r\nbest capture.\r\n\r\nHaving got home with the left-hand pocket more or less filled, turn\r\nthe boxes out, preparatory to killing the contents, which must be done\r\nwith burnt sulphur. My mode of proceeding is as follows:--I stupefy\r\nthe contents of each box with chloroform, in a manner I will describe\r\nfarther on. Having stupefied them, I empty them all into a short,\r\nwide-mouthed, round bottle, having a piece of glass tube put through\r\nthe cork; the mouth of the tube is plugged with cotton wool, not too\r\ntight, to act as a strainer. I then put this in a Nabob pickle-bottle\r\n(any other bottle will do as well), through the stopper of which I have\r\ndrilled a hole about a sixteenth of an inch in diameter, in which is\r\nfixed a copper wire, having a shallow tin cup at the end. In this tin\r\ncup is placed the sulphur. The tin cup is then held over the flame of a\r\nlamp, gas, or candle, till the sulphur is burning, then put it into the\r\nbottle and press it down. When all the oxygen is consumed the sulphur\r\ngoes out. Leave them for about three hours, take them out, and put\r\nthem into a damp box for twelve or more hours: they will then be in a\r\nsplendid condition for setting. To stupefy the insects I tip the lids\r\non one side, put them into the sulphur bottle, pour a drop or two into\r\nthe tin cup, and put it into the bottle. Be careful not to chloroform\r\nthem too much, as if killed so they become so rigid that it is with\r\ndifficulty they can be set.\r\n\r\nHaving killed them, there only remains to pin and set them. There are\r\nvarious sizes of pins used; most collectors have fancies of their\r\nown on this subject; I shall therefore only say what is my practice.\r\nThe pins I use are D. F. Tayler & Co.'s, New Hall Works, Birmingham;\r\nNo. 15 for bumble-bees only; the other sizes I find most useful are\r\n15, 10, and 18. Some pin the insects straight, and some with the pin\r\ninclining forward. Having pinned them, the next thing is to set them.\r\nThere are two ways of doing this; one is, cut an oblong square of stout\r\ncardboard, and put a pin through one end; after the legs are stretched\r\nout, this is put into the cork, one on each side, till the upper\r\nsurface of cork is just below the level of the wings, which are then\r\nlaid out on the card, and held there by a brace the same shape as the\r\ntable (see Fig. 28). If the insect has been properly killed, the legs\r\nand antennæ will keep set out without the aid of pins; if not, this is\r\ndone with bent or straight pins, as may be necessary. The other way is\r\na \"hymn of my own composing.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 28 Insect set with Table Braces.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 29 Wood, with the Strips glued on.]\r\n\r\nFirst take one of the strips of cork as sold at the shops, paper it on\r\nboth sides with thin soft paper; then take a piece of wood a little\r\nlarger than the cork, about half an inch thick; on this I glue strips\r\nof cardboard, or thin wood, according to the size of the insect, side\r\nby side, and as far apart as necessary (see Fig. 29). These being dry,\r\nI glue the sheet of cork on to the top of the strips, which leaves it\r\nlooking like a succession of bridges. When this is dry the cork must be\r\ncut through between the pieces first fastened on the wood. These pieces\r\nare then taken out and glued to the wood (see Fig. 30); this leaves\r\nmany setting boards, something similar to the single rounded ones used\r\nby Lepidopterists; but these are flat--they want to be just deep enough\r\nfor the insect and wide enough to allow the legs to be stretched out. A\r\nlittle practice will soon determine the size. The wing I hold down with\r\nsmall triangular braces. Each board will hold about seventy or eighty\r\ninsects; beneath I put the date they were set, and leave them on the\r\nboard about a month to dry, as if taken off too soon the wings spring.\r\nAlways put a label to each specimen, either with the date or a number\r\ncorresponding to one in a book, in which enter the date and locality.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 30. Ditto, side view. A, the same with the cork\r\nglued on; B, cork; C, the same with the cork cut through at the dotted\r\nlines in A, and fastened down.]\r\n\r\nOne more observation and I have done. Sometimes one comes across an\r\ninsect whose rigid wings seem to defy all attempts to set; in such\r\ncases just press firmly at the back part of the thorax, between that\r\nand the abdomen, towards the pin, and the wings will sometimes fly open\r\nof their own accord, or will allow of their being easily set in the\r\nrequired direction, which should always be set well forward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\nLAND AND FRESHWATER SHELLS, ETC.\r\n\r\nBy Professor Ralph Tate, F.G.S., etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nA young friend, desirous of entering upon one of the most accessible\r\nnatural history pursuits, that of the study of Land and Freshwater\r\nMolluscs, begged of me some practical hints on the collection\r\nand preservation of these objects of our woodlands, waysides,\r\nand watercourses. Believing that this kind of work offers a good\r\nstepping-stone to the study of nature in its more extended forms and\r\ncomplicated relations, I was most anxious to help my tyro naturalist,\r\nand that beyond his utmost expectations, as I made a few initiatory\r\ntrips with him in a search for the coveted treasures.\r\n\r\nOur equipment was simple and inexpensive, consisting of a block-tin\r\nsaucepan finely perforated at the bottom, about six inches across, and\r\nhaving a hollow handle of a size to receive firmly the end of a common\r\nwalking-stick--such a _dredge_ or a _sifter_ will cost ninepence or a\r\nshilling at a tinman's; secondly, of a pocket lens; and lastly, of a\r\nvariety of boxes, and a bag to contain specimens of different sizes.\r\nThus provided, our first excursion had for its object an examination\r\nof certain neighbouring ponds and streams. My pupil, guessing the use\r\nof the perforated saucepan, makes his way to the nearest pond, fixes\r\nthe improvised handle, dashes in the _sifter_ with impatient ardour,\r\nand having brought up a quantity of mud from the bottom, looked upon\r\nthe oozy mass with despair. Patience, my lad! Remember that the\r\npleasure of success in science is the higher the greater the labour\r\nexpended in obtaining the objects of our search. Expect failure now\r\nand again, but do not be disheartened. _Ohne Hast ohne Rast_, should\r\nbe the motto of every naturalist. Now, shake the tin in the water,\r\nkeeping its rim just out of the water, dipping it down now and then.\r\nThat is well; thus you see that you have cleared off the mud, and what\r\nyou want is probably left behind along with the rubbish. What, nothing!\r\nCome, try again; but this time scrape the sifter along the surface of\r\nthe mud, and I am confident that you will find something to reward you,\r\nand with much less trouble and display of temper. In this way, after\r\nrepeated trials, a number of shells were secured and transferred to\r\nthe boxes. Then, after the first gush of excitement is over, we retire\r\nto an adjoining bank to con over the spoils, and I to make mention\r\nof the various habits of freshwater snails, and consequently of the\r\ndifferent modes of search. My young friend's enthusiasm is aroused by\r\nthe mention that a few large mussel-like shells are inhabitants of our\r\nfresh waters, and great is his haste to be up and again doing, in the\r\nhope of adding some of them to his stock. But in vain were his many\r\nattempts to find them in the pond which had already yielded us such a\r\nvariety. \"Do they live here?\" is at last the anxious question. \"No; but\r\nlet us away to yon sluggish brook, for it is in such that we may expect\r\nto meet with them.\" \"Now I see them. Are not those their ends just\r\npeeping above the mud?\" And full of eagerness he dashes in the dredge,\r\nbut with little result, excepting that of a dead shell or two. \"Oh! how\r\ncan I get them? Shall I take off my shoes and socks and wade for them?\"\r\n\"Well, you might secure them that way, and sometimes it is the only\r\nway, but on this occasion I do not think it necessary. Come, we will\r\nmove a little higher up, where the stream is clear, and the shellfish\r\nundisturbed. Observe the gaping ends of the shell, and thus I push the\r\nend of the stout rod between the partially-open valves; now they close\r\nupon the stick, and so we bring our prize holding on to the stick to\r\nthe bank.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will recollect,\" addressing my companion, \"that in the muddy pond\r\nwe have just left, we chiefly got small bivalves and only a few snail\r\nshells. I have already told you that water shells differ much in their\r\nhabits, and that consequently our search for any particular species, or\r\nset of species, can only be successfully carried on when that knowledge\r\nis our guide. Those little bivalves, and a few of the snails that we\r\nhave gathered, habitually live at the bottom, and will of course be\r\nbrought up in the dredge when that implement is dragged over it; but\r\nthere are many shells which live at or near the surface, and which\r\nfeed on the submerged and floating plants. Therefore we must seek out\r\na weedy pool if we would increase the variety of our collection.\" Such\r\na spot is reached; and the dredge is brought into requisition, anon\r\nto snatch up a floating snail, or again to sweep over and through the\r\nplants, varying our occupation by dragging to the margin the tangled\r\nmasses of weeds; by all of which means a considerable number of the\r\nclass of air-breathing water snails was obtained--admonishing my young\r\nfriend that this last plan does very well when the plants grow in dense\r\nmasses, because when thus interlaced they form a natural net to catch\r\nthose snails which on the slightest disturbance lose their hold upon\r\nthe weeds, and which would otherwise fall to the bottom.\r\n\r\nYet another plan remains to be pursued, one by which the few small\r\nshells hiding among the roots of the plants may be secured. Obviously\r\nthe dredge misses such; but by pulling up the plants by their roots,\r\nand well shaking them in the half-sunken sifter, we yet after all\r\nobtain them.\r\n\r\nFrom causes which need not be explained here, the shells living in some\r\nponds are all much eroded, or coated with a ferruginous deposit; it\r\nwill be desirable therefore to find out the localities where specimens\r\nare in the best condition, so that you may have typical specimens for\r\ncomparison before an extensive collection is made.\r\n\r\nOur experience is, that though a considerable number of species may\r\nbe obtained from a ditch or pond, yet a few are found as the sole\r\nmolluscan tenants of particular sheets of water; that lakes exhibit a\r\ndearth of life, and that the greatest variety is often to be met with\r\nin canals; but should a search be carried on in them, avoid the towpath\r\nside, for reasons that a little thought will readily suggest.\r\n\r\nLiving near the sea, and within a short distance of wooded hill-sides,\r\nwe had within a limited area such a variety of physical features that\r\nwe were led to infer the existence of a rich molluscan fauna for the\r\nneighbourhood. Our second excursion was devoted to a search for snails\r\nalong the sea margin and shores of the estuary. Proceeding along the\r\nlow sand-dunes--at first sight a most uninteresting spot--_Helix\r\ncaperata_, _H. virgata_, _Bulimus acutus_, and a few other snails, were\r\nfound clustering upon the low stunted vegetation in such numbers, that\r\nhandfuls might have been gathered within an area of a few square feet.\r\nLeaving the seashore, our way led us over the foreshore of the mouth\r\nof the river, crushing under our feet at every step shells of _Cardium\r\nedule_, _Scrobicularia piperata_, and a few other bivalves which find\r\na congenial habitat in such situations. Gaining the muddy margins of\r\nthe higher part of the estuary, _Conovulus_ was looked for, and found\r\nunder the stones along the high-water mark. Higher up the river the\r\nrejectamentum on its banks was carefully turned over, and we were\r\nsuccessful in securing a number of land shells. The animals, of course,\r\ndo not live in such places; but their empty shells, which alone were\r\nfound, had been brought down from the land surface by the agency of\r\nthe streams and tributaries of the river. Nevertheless such an _omnium\r\ngatherum_ should demand attention, as its contents give an insight\r\ninto the character of the land and freshwater forms within the area of\r\ndrainage of the river.\r\n\r\nThe number of estuarine species which have a place in our works devoted\r\nto British land and freshwater snails is very few, and the majority,\r\nmoreover, are confined to the margins of the tidal rivers in the south\r\nof England. Thus _Assiminea Grayana_, _Hydrobia ventrosa_, and _H.\r\nsimilis_, live on the mud banks beneath the shade of sedges and rushes,\r\nskirting the Thames below Greenwich. To gather these small shells\r\nsingly is a tedious operation; but if a thin piece of flat wood, or\r\nother substitute as the ingenuity of the collector suggests, be used to\r\nscrape lightly over the surface of mud, transferring the mass to the\r\n_dredger_, and washing in water, a number of specimens sufficient to\r\nstock every private cabinet in the country may be obtained in a short\r\nspace of time.\r\n\r\nFor the third initiatory excursion our steps were directed inland, and\r\nas we proceeded the hedgerows, mossy banks, and margins of watercourses\r\nwere diligently searched, finding a _Helix_ here, a _Pupa_ or a\r\n_Succinea_ there. Gaining the woods, we turn over the damp leaves, grub\r\nunder the clumps of ferns and wood-rushes for small Helices, Pupæ, and\r\nthe like; scan the trunks of the trees for the climbing _Clausiliæ_,\r\n_Bulimi_, and _Helices_, not unmindful that each little dirt-like mass\r\nis probably a _Bulimus obscurus_, which, by covering its shell with\r\nmud, thus exhibits a protective faculty, and often escapes detection.\r\nRaise the rotting bark for _Balia_; lift the stones at our feet, or\r\nroll away a log for _Helicella_, and other small shells which usually\r\nlive in such situations.\r\n\r\nFrom all this we learn that each species affects certain stations, and\r\ntherefore, with the knowledge of the circumstances in which they are\r\nfound, we may set out with some definite idea as to what we are likely\r\nto meet with; and, in consequence, when to collect and where to collect\r\nare regulated by the unvarying habits of the objects of our search.\r\n\r\nNow, a large portion of the life of most land snails is passed in a\r\nstate of sleep. Those living in open situations are inactive during the\r\nheat of a summer's day, and when there is continued drought; but on the\r\nfirst shower, or after the fall of dew at night, they recover and move\r\nabout in search of food. Cold acts much in the same way as heat, and\r\nwith the fall of the leaf they retire to winter quarters in crannies of\r\nrocks, crevices of walls, under heaps of decaying vegetation, &c., or\r\nbury themselves in the soil, there to hybernate till the genial showers\r\nof spring awaken them.\r\n\r\nThe best time of the year for collecting is in the autumn, when the\r\nshells are full-grown. Those collected in spring have lost much of\r\ntheir original beauty by exposure to the rains and cold of the winter\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nAs regards the particular time of day to collect with advantage, it\r\nhas already been implied that a search in an open country should be\r\nprosecuted after a shower of rain, or during early morn. In damp woods,\r\nwhere throughout the day the air is sufficiently moist to maintain the\r\nanimals in full activity, no such considerations determine the best\r\ntime for collecting. In such places, light is usually the desideratum,\r\nand consequently I have found that a search conducted at midday in a\r\nclear sky has been amply rewarded.\r\n\r\nLand snails exhibit a partiality for calcareous soils, not only by\r\nthose living on downs and hill-sides, but also by the woodland species.\r\n\r\nHaving spent the forenoons of three days in gathering slugs and snails\r\nas before detailed, one evening was devoted to the preparation of the\r\nspecimens for the cabinet.\r\n\r\nThe first step was to remove the animals, and, as all know, it is\r\nneither an easy nor a clean task to separate the living snail and\r\nits house; but kill your snail, and the muscular connection with the\r\nshell being severed, its whole body is readily taken out by means of a\r\npin--why, it is just like picking periwinkles; and if the proclivities\r\nof our childhood's days are not entirely obliterated, cleaning out\r\nlarger snails from their shells will be a task requiring no teaching.\r\nBut, with regard to the smaller kind, it is another matter, and it will\r\nbe my duty to show you how to set about the work.\r\n\r\nNow pick out those shells, the apertures of which are wide enough, as\r\nit seems to you, to permit the removal of the dead body of the snail\r\nby a pin. You may also place with them the larger bivalves. All these\r\nwe will boil to kill the animals; then strain off the water, and wash\r\nwith cold water. By this means the bodies contract, and being firmer\r\nare not so liable to be broken in the process of removal. Shake the\r\nwater out of the empty shell, and place them before the fire to dry;\r\ndo not rub them, but particles of dirt may be gently flicked off by\r\nthe aid of a camel-hair brush. Thus we treat the larger snails. Now\r\nfor the mussels. Doubtless most of the dead bodies will have fallen\r\nout between the open valves while in the water; should any remain, a\r\nslight shaking of the shell held by the hand in the water will remove\r\nthe contained body. Taken from the water, the valves gape widely; dry\r\nthe inside and outside with a cloth, and having tape or cotton at\r\nhand, close the valves by the pressure of the thumb and fingers of the\r\none hand, and with the end of the thread between your teeth, wind the\r\nthread two or three times around the shell with the other; now tie the\r\nthread as tight as you can. \"Yes, I have done so, but still the valves\r\nare not closed.\" True, this is because of the elasticity of thread. If,\r\nhowever, you will take the precaution to wet the thread before tying,\r\nyou will find that the tie is more secure, and that there is less\r\ndifficulty in making the second knot.\r\n\r\nWith patience and a little skill, bivalves as small as _Cyclas cornea_\r\nmay be treated in this way. But the smaller _Pisidiums_, and some\r\nof the minute snails, as _Carychium minimum_, may be prepared for\r\nthe cabinet by gently drying them in sand; too great a heat causes a\r\ntransfusion of the carbonaceous matter of the animal into the substance\r\nof the shell, which is thereby discoloured.\r\n\r\nThere still remain for treatment such shells as _Clausilia_, _Bulimus_,\r\n_Helicella_, some Helices, &c., the animals of which retreat, on the\r\nleast irritation, beyond the reach of a pin, and whose shells, indeed,\r\nwill hardly bear the rough handling almost necessary when a pin is\r\nused. Their bodies might be dried within the shells, but if it be\r\npossible to remove some portion only of the animal, an attempt should\r\nbe made to do so.\r\n\r\nLand snails, when placed in water, do their best to effect an escape\r\nfrom a medium so fatal to them; their efforts are usually exhibited by\r\nstretching out their bodies to the utmost, swaying them to and fro\r\nas if in search of a foothold. Taking advantage of this propensity,\r\nthe snails should be immersed in tepid water, because the majority,\r\nafter a day or two's confinement in the collecting boxes, will be in a\r\ndormant condition, and warm water has a greater resuscitating effect\r\nthan cold. When all the snails are struggling to find a way out of\r\ntheir unpleasant situation, gradually add hot water so as to kill or\r\nparalyze them while in an extended state. They may now be thrown into\r\nboiling water, the better to relax the muscular attachments, and the\r\nbodies, or so much as will come away, dragged out by forceps, or a pin\r\npassed through the foot. The shells may now be dried in sand, as before\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nIn cleaning the shells of some species, great care is needed, so as\r\nnot to remove the hairs or bristles which clothe the surface of the\r\nepidermis.\r\n\r\nThe shells of such snails as _Paludina_, _Cyclostoma_, &c., &c., would\r\nbe imperfectly illustrated without the opercula or lids which close the\r\napertures of their shells. Each one should be detached from the foot of\r\nthe snail, the interior of the shell plugged with cotton wool, and the\r\nspecimen gummed down in its natural position.\r\n\r\nThe preservation of slugs requires separate treatment, and I can give\r\nbut little additional information to that published in my 'British Land\r\nand Freshwater Molluscs' an extract from which is subjoined:--\r\n\r\n\"As regards the internal shell, it may be obtained by making a conical\r\nincision in the shield, taking care not to cut down upon the calcareous\r\nplate, which can then be removed without difficulty. The animals\r\ncan only be conserved by keeping them in some preservative fluid;\r\nbut the great object to keep in view is to have the slug naturally\r\nextended. Most fluids contract the slugs when they are immersed in\r\nthem. The slugs should be killed whilst crawling, by plunging them\r\ninto a solution of corrosive sublimate, or into benzine. Models in\r\nwax or dough are sometimes substituted for the animals. A writer in\r\nthe 'Naturalist' gives a process for the preservation of slugs, which\r\nhe states to answer admirably, and to be very superior to spirit,\r\nglycerine, creosote, and other solutions:--'Make a cold saturated\r\nsolution of _corrosive sublimate_; put it into a deep wide-mouthed\r\nbottle; then take the slug you wish to preserve, and let it crawl upon\r\na long slip of card. When the tentacles are fully extended, plunge it\r\nsuddenly into the solution; in a few minutes it will die, with the\r\ntentacles fully extended in the most life-like manner; so much so\r\nindeed, if taken out of the fluid it would be difficult to say whether\r\nit be alive or dead. The slugs thus prepared should not be mounted\r\nin spirit, as it is apt to contract and discolour them. A mixture of\r\none and a half parts of water and one part of glycerine, I find to\r\nbe the best mounting fluid. It preserves the colour beautifully, and\r\nits antiseptic qualities are unexceptionable. A good-sized test-tube\r\nanswers better than a bottle for putting them up, as it admits of\r\ncloser examination of the animal. The only drawback to this process\r\nis, that unless the solution is of sufficient strength, and unless the\r\ntentacles are extruded when the animal is immersed, it generally, but\r\nnot invariably, fails. Some slugs appear to be more susceptible to the\r\naction of the fluid than others; and it generally answers better with\r\nfull-grown than with young specimens. But if successful, the specimens\r\nare as satisfactory as could be desired; and even if unsuccessful, they\r\nare a great deal better than those preserved in spirit; for, although\r\nthe tentacles may not be completely extruded, they are more or less\r\nso'\".\r\n\r\nThe Testacellæ I have treated in the following manner: by partially\r\ndrying them in sand, and removal of the soft parts through a cut in the\r\nlength of the foot, filling up with cotton wool and a renewal of the\r\ndrying.\r\n\r\nOur land and freshwater snails have other structures besides their\r\nshells which should claim our attention. These, which include their\r\njaws, tongues, and some other minute parts, are not so inaccessible\r\nas one is at first too apt to consider, and are deservedly in favour\r\nas microscopic objects requiring a low power. I shall assume that\r\nthe collector has preserved the bodies or the heads of the snails\r\nin spirit, which he has removed from their shells in the process of\r\npreparing them for his cabinet. He will take care to keep separate the\r\nanimals of each species.\r\n\r\nA last word upon the mode of displaying the shells in the cabinet. Here\r\none has considerable choice, as they may be kept in open card trays,\r\nor in glass-topped boxes, or gummed on cards, papered boards, or glass\r\ntablets. Loose specimens admit of ready examination, whilst the method\r\nof mounting permits an arrangement of individuals according to size and\r\nlocality, and is much to be preferred.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\nFLOWERING PLANTS AND FERNS.\r\n\r\nBy James Britten, F.L.S.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I.\r\n\r\nThe kindred subjects of the collecting of plants and their arrangement\r\nin the herbarium have been treated of over and over again, and it might\r\nalmost seem as though nothing further need be said upon the matter. But\r\nin spite of all that has been written, it cannot be said that anything\r\nlike uniform excellence has been attained, either in the collecting\r\nor drying of specimens: on the contrary, much carelessness is still\r\nexhibited in both particulars, and the following remarks on the subject\r\nmay therefore be useful to some, at any rate, among the readers of\r\n'Science Gossip.' It has been found impossible to treat both points\r\nadequately in one paper, so, on the present occasion, we shall devote\r\nourselves to collecting, leaving the arrangement and matters connected\r\ntherewith for another occasion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 31. Young Plant of _Ipomæa Quamoclit_\r\n(from Decandolle's 'Organographie').]\r\n\r\nThe great aim to be kept in view in collecting is to obtain as perfect\r\nand comprehensive a specimen as possible; that is, one showing every\r\npart of the plant--root, leaves, flowers, and fruit. It is not always\r\npracticable to show all these upon one specimen, and in such cases such\r\na number must be selected as will carry out this plan. The wretched\r\nscraps with which some collectors content themselves are not only\r\nuseless to their owners, but annoyances to everyone who has to do with\r\nthem, or who is requested to pronounce an opinion upon them. Anyone\r\nwho has had anything to do with naming plants for 'Science Gossip' or\r\nany other journal, which in this manner supplies information to its\r\nsubscribers, will be able to testify to the large number of persons who\r\ndo not scruple to send for determination single leaves, or a terminal\r\nshoot of a flowering plant, or a pinnule of a fern without fruit;\r\na proceeding which is unfair to those to whom they are submitted,\r\ninasmuch as they either have to risk their reputation for accuracy,\r\nor to appear uncourteous by refusing to have anything to do with such\r\nspecimens.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 32. Lime (_Tilia Europæa_).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 33. Beech (_Fagus sylvatica_).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 34. Sycamore (_Acer pseudo-platanus_),\r\nshowing cotyledons and first and second pair of leaves.]\r\n\r\nTo begin at the beginning, How rarely do we find the embryo of any\r\nspecies represented in a collection of dried plants? It ought to be\r\nthere, not only as essential to the complete presentment of the history\r\nof the species, but as in certain cases indicating relationships which\r\nare not apparent when the plant is more advanced. Those who have not\r\nobserved them would be surprised to find how much variety of form\r\nexists in the cotyledons alone, from the fleshy cotyledons of many\r\nof the Leguminosæ, the horse-chestnut, &c., to the foliaceous ones,\r\nor seed-leaves, of other plants. Among the latter may be noted and\r\ncompared the lobed or palmate cotyledons of the lime (Fig. 32); the\r\nglossy dark green, somewhat kidney-shaped ones of the beech (Fig.\r\n33); and the pinnatifid ones of the common garden cress (_Lepidium\r\nsativum_); the obcordate ones of the mustard or radish; the long,\r\nnarrow, thin ones of the sycamore (Fig. 34); the sinuous or corrugated\r\nand bilobed ones of the walnut, and many more which will occur to the\r\nobservant reader, or which may be collected by anyone who will take\r\nthe trouble to watch the germination of plants. And by making such\r\ncollections, unexpected discoveries may arise, which will yet further\r\nconfirm what has been said about the variety in form and structure\r\neven in these beginnings of growth. Plants which are, on account of\r\ntheir general affinities, reckoned among the dicotyledons, may be found\r\non investigation to have but one cotyledon, as Dr. Dickson observed\r\nto be the case with two of our butterworts, _Pinguicula vulgaris_\r\nand _P. grandiflora_, the third species, _P. lusitanica_, being\r\ndicotyledonous; or even to be acotyledonous, as is the case with the\r\ndodder (_Cuscuta_). In the latter-named genus, it is of importance to\r\ncollect young specimens, as showing that the plant, although parasitic\r\nas soon as it comes in contact with a suitable foster-plant, is of\r\nindependent origin. A search among young plants will no doubt lead to\r\nthe discovery of some abnormalities, such as tricotyledonous embryos\r\nand other irregularities. Of some plants, such as the furze, the true\r\nleaves can only be found at an early stage of growth; in others, much\r\nvariation may be noted in many points between the first leaves and\r\nthe more perfect ones which succeed them; some, as the holly, at once\r\ndeveloping leaves similar to those which are produced throughout the\r\nlife of the plant, and others going through many modifications before\r\nthe ultimate shape is attained, as in the ash, elder, ivy, maple, &c.\r\n\r\nThe roots or rhizomes also require to be much more fully represented\r\nand carefully collected than is usually the case. In every instance\r\nwhere the size of the plant does not prevent, the subterranean and\r\nsubaqueous parts should be carefully procured and preserved.\r\n\r\nDr. Trimen has lately directed attention to the corm-like tubers of the\r\nwater plantain (_Alisma_),[G] closely resembling those of the arrowhead\r\n(_Sagittaria_), which have been described and figured by Nolte, but\r\n\"do not seem to have been observed, or at least properly understood,\r\nin this country. They are buds remaining dormant through the winter,\r\nand containing a store of nutriment, to be employed in the development\r\nof the new plant from the tuber in the next year.\" Similar bulbs are\r\ndeveloped by the frogbit (_Hydrocharis_). In determining many grasses\r\nand rushes, it is of importance to ascertain whether the rhizome is\r\ncreeping or cæspitose, and it is therefore essential to collect good\r\nspecimens. In the case of such plants as the coral-wort (_Dentaria\r\nbulbifera_) and toothwort (_Lathræa squamaria_), the root-stocks\r\nare eminently characteristic. Of such parasites as the broomrapes\r\n(_Orobanche_), some care is requisite in obtaining specimens in which\r\nthe connection between the parasite and its foster-plant may be\r\npreserved and shown. The absence or presence of tubers should also be\r\nnoted, and if present, they must be represented.\r\n\r\n[G] 'Journal of Botany,' 1871, p. 306.\r\n\r\nPassing on to the leaves, we may note the importance of obtaining\r\nin every case the root-leaves of each species. These are often very\r\ndifferent in form from the stem-leaves, as in such species as the\r\nharebell (_Campanula rotundifolia_), _Pimpinella saxifraga_, the\r\nearth-nut (_Bunium flexuosum_), and many more; in some instances, as in\r\nthe Jersey bugloss (_Echium plantagineum_), they at once characterize\r\nthe species. Still more important are these lower leaves in the case of\r\nwater-plants: in the arrowhead (_Sagittaria_), for example, they are\r\nnarrow, and resemble those of the bur-reed (_Sparganium_); and in the\r\nwater plantain (_Alisma plantago_), the submerged leaves are equally\r\ndifferent from those which rise out of the water. This difference is\r\nstill more noticeable in the case of the aquatic _Ranunculi_, where a\r\nknowledge of the submerged leaves is essential to the discrimination of\r\nthe various forms or species.\r\n\r\nWhere practicable, the whole plant should be collected for the\r\nherbarium; but when, from its size, this cannot be accomplished, leaves\r\nfrom the root, the centre of the main stem, and the lateral branches,\r\nshould be taken. As to the stem itself, that must be represented: in\r\nthe _Rubi_, indeed, it is essential. \"To judge properly of a bramble\r\nfrom a preserved specimen,\" says Professor Babington, \"we require a\r\npiece of the middle of the stem with more than one leaf; the base and\r\ntip of the stem are also desirable, likewise a piece of the old stem\r\nwith the flowering shoot attached to it; the panicle with flowers,\r\nand the fruit. We likewise want to know the direction of the stem\r\nthroughout, of the leaflets, and of the calyx; also the shape of the\r\npetals and the colour of the styles: a note of these should be made\r\nwhen the specimen is gathered.\"\r\n\r\nPassing on to the flowers, we shall find it necessary to represent\r\nthem in almost every stage, from the bud to the perfecting of the\r\nfruit. It is of course in most cases possible to select an example\r\nin such a state as to show upon the same plant buds, flowers, and\r\nfruits; but where this is not the case, each of these particulars must\r\nbe supplemented by additional specimens. The turn which botanical\r\ninvestigation has recently taken towards the study of the phenomena\r\nconnected with fertilization has given the collector another subject to\r\nwhich his attention may be profitably directed. It has been observed\r\nthat in some plants the stamens are developed before the pistils;\r\nin others, the pistils are matured before the stamens; while in\r\nyet a third set, stamens and pistils are simultaneously perfected.\r\nThese three groups of plants are termed respectively protandrous,\r\nprotogynous, and cynacmic, and a very little observation will show that\r\nexamples of each are sufficiently common.\r\n\r\nThen in dioecious and monoecious plants, both male and female\r\nflowers must be collected, and in some cases, as in the willows, four\r\nspecimens are necessary to the complete presentment of the species,\r\nshowing respectively the male and female catkins, the leaves, and\r\nthe fruit. Some plants produce two distinct forms of blossom, as is\r\nnoticeable in the violets and the woodsorrel, one being conspicuous\r\nand usually barren, the other insignificant and often apetalous, but\r\nproducing perfect fruit. The pollen will afford occupation to the\r\nmicroscopist: the researches of Mr. Gulliver and Mr. Charles Bailey\r\nhave demonstrated that important distinguishing characters are in some\r\ninstances furnished by it. While on this point it may be suggested\r\nthat it is convenient in many cases to collect several specimens of\r\nthe flowers alone, which, when dried, should be placed in a small\r\nenvelope or capsule, and attached to the sheet on which the plant is\r\nrepresented. In the event of any examination which may be requisite\r\nafter the plant is dried, these detached blossoms will be found very\r\nuseful, and will prevent the necessity of damaging the specimen. In\r\nthe case of such plants as shed their corollas very readily, as the\r\nspeedwells, it is as well to put them in press as soon as collected;\r\nand the colour of many may be retained by the same means.\r\n\r\nThe fruits and seeds of plants are too generally neglected by amateur\r\ncollectors, but are essential to the completeness of a specimen. It\r\nmay be found practically convenient to keep these in a separate place,\r\nand detached from the plant; and in many cases of dried fruits it is\r\nadvisable to sort them into their places without previous pressing.\r\nBy this means the modes of dehiscence will readily be seen: pulpy and\r\nsucculent fruits should be preserved in spirit. In such plants as the\r\nspecies of sea sandwort (_Lepigonum_), and some Chenopodia, important\r\nspecific characters are drawn from the seed; as they are from the pods\r\nof _Melilotus_ and the fruits of _Agrimonia_. In collecting ferns,\r\nwell-fruited fronds must be selected, as it is impossible to determine\r\nspecimens without fructification. Grasses should be selected when in\r\nflower and fruit, but must not be allowed to attain too great an age\r\nbefore they are collected.\r\n\r\nWe have been speaking so far of the things to be collected, and space\r\nwill not allow us to dilate at any length upon the apparatus necessary\r\nto that end. Nor indeed is this necessary; a good-sized vasculum, with\r\none or two smaller boxes for the pocket, in which the more delicate\r\nplants may be preserved; a strong pocket-knife or small trowel, for\r\nprocuring roots, and a hooked stick wherewith to fish out water-plants,\r\nor pull down branches, are the principal things required. To anyone\r\nresiding for any length of time, or even only for a few days, in a\r\ndistrict, a \"London Catalogue\" is an important acquisition, in which\r\nshould be marked off all the species met with; by this means the flora\r\nof the neighbourhood is ascertained at a very slight expenditure of\r\ntime and trouble. It is not advisable to collect too many plants at\r\nonce, or to crowd the vasculum, unless under exceptional circumstances;\r\nnor should the desire to possess rare plants tend, as is too often the\r\ncase, to the neglect and exclusion of commoner ones.\r\n\r\nA careful and observant collector will frequently meet with forms\r\nwhich deviate more or less from the accepted type of a species. When\r\nthese appear to offer any marked characters, they should be noted; and\r\nin all cases it is well to preserve any forms which, from external\r\ncircumstances, have a different appearance from the normal state. The\r\ndifferences produced by soil and situation alone are very considerable;\r\nand though the essential characters are usually to be discerned,\r\nthe interest and value of a herbarium are very much increased by a\r\nselection of examples showing the range of a species. _Campanula\r\nglomerata_ offers a good example of this. In damp meadows it is from\r\none to two feet high, with a large spreading terminal head of blossoms,\r\nwhile on chalk downs it does not attain more than as many inches, with\r\nonly one or two flowers; in this state it was described by Withering as\r\na gentian, under the name of _Gentiana collina_; and the same author\r\ngives as _Campanula uniflora_ a one-flowered mountain state of the\r\nharebell (_C. rotundifolia_).\r\n\r\nThe collector will also do well to keep a look-out for deviations in\r\nstructure, which are often of great interest. In short, nothing should\r\nbe neglected which can tend to the perfect presentment of a species in\r\nthe herbarium: its utility is commensurate with its completeness. The\r\nmere collector may be satisfied with scraps of a rare plant and the\r\nabsence of commoner species; but the real worker will pride himself\r\nrather upon the possession of instructive examples, which may be of\r\nassistance to himself, as well as to all those who may consult them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.\r\n\r\nFLOWERING PLANTS AND FERNS.\r\n\r\nBy James Britten, F.L.S.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II.\r\n\r\nWe will assume that our collecting for the year has come to a close;\r\nthat the long evenings are beginning, and that our dried plants have\r\nbeen brought together from their temporary resting-places to be revised\r\nand selected from, so that they may be intercalated in their places in\r\nthe herbarium, if we already possess one, or, if we are as yet quite\r\nnovices, that they may form a nucleus around which the whole British\r\nflora shall be gathered in due course. First of all, we must make all\r\nnecessary preparation for--\r\n\r\n_Mounting_, the first essential to which is paper. Much of the neatness\r\nof a herbarium depends upon its uniformity, so that it is desirable\r\nto lay down a definite plan at the beginning and to act up to it\r\nconsistently. Amateurs often spoil specimens which they have collected\r\nand preserved with considerable care by transferring them from one\r\nsheet to another; from books--but it is only _very_ amateur botanists\r\nwho keep their plants in this way!--to loose sheets, from small paper\r\nto large, and so on; each change being attended with some slight damage\r\nto the specimen so treated. It is, I believe, the common practice on\r\nthe Continent to keep the specimens loose in folded sheets of paper;\r\nbut this plan is not followed in England, and although advantageous,\r\nas permitting the fullest examination of the plant, it is attended\r\nwith much risk to the specimens in the way of breakage; so that we\r\nmay consider it settled that we are going to fasten our plant down\r\nupon a sheet of paper. This must be rather stout, and large enough\r\nto admit the full representation of the species. The sheets used at\r\nthe Kew Herbarium are 16-1/2 inches long by 10-1/3 inches wide; those\r\nemployed at the British Museum are 17-1/2 inches by 11-1/4 inches; but\r\nthe former will be found amply sufficient for our purpose. The next\r\nconsideration is the means by which the specimens are to be secured,\r\nwhich are more various than might at first be supposed. Some persons\r\nsew them to the paper; others place straps over them, which are secured\r\nwith small pins; but the choice practically lies between fixing the\r\nwhole specimen to the paper with gum, paste, or glue, or securing it\r\nwith straps of gummed paper. The former plan, which is that adopted at\r\nour great public herbaria, is certainly better for specimens which\r\nare likely to be much consulted; but the latter is in some respects\r\nmore satisfactory, if somewhat tedious, as it admits the removal of the\r\nplant to another sheet if necessary, and delicate portions, such as\r\nthin petals or leaves, are not injured as they are when gummed down. At\r\nthe British Museum and Kew a mixture of gum tragacanth and gum-arabic\r\n(the former dissolved in the latter), in about equal parts, is used for\r\nthis purpose; but very coriaceous specimens are secured with glue at\r\nthe last-named establishment, while in the former the stems and ends\r\nof branches are usually also secured with straps. When the specimen is\r\nentirely gummed down, it is a good plan to keep a few extra flowers or\r\nfruits in a small capsule attached to the sheet: these will be useful\r\nif it is required to dissect such portions, and the specimen need not\r\nbe injured for such purpose.\r\n\r\n_Poisoning._--Some persons are in the habit of employing a solution of\r\ncorrosive sublimate for the purpose of washing over their plants when\r\nmounted, and so preventing the development of animal life. The solution\r\nin use at the Kew Herbarium is composed of one pound of corrosive\r\nsublimate, and the same quantity of carbolic acid to four gallons of\r\nmethylated spirit; this fulfils the purpose for which it is intended\r\nvery well, but is somewhat disagreeable to use. At the British Museum\r\nit is found that the presence of camphor, frequently renewed in each\r\ncabinet, is sufficient to prevent the attacks of insects. It will soon\r\nbe discovered that some plants, such, for example, as the _Umbelliferæ_\r\nand _Grossulariaceæ_, are peculiarly liable to such attacks; and these\r\norders must be inspected from time to time, so that any insect ravages\r\nmay at once be checked. Damp is to be avoided in the situation of the\r\nherbarium, as it favours the development not only of insects but of\r\nmould, and renders the specimens rotten.\r\n\r\nThe question of _labelling_ is of some importance, especially to those\r\nwho value neatness and uniformity in the appearance of their herbarium.\r\nOne or two sets of printed labels for this purpose have been issued,\r\nbut they cannot be recommended. They give more than is necessary, e.g.\r\nthe English, or, more correctly, the book-English names, the general\r\nhabitats, and definite localities of rare species, and allow very\r\ninsufficient space for filling in the date and place of collecting,\r\nthe name of the collector, and such remarks as occasionally occur.\r\nThe plan of writing all necessary information upon the sheet itself\r\nis a good one; but those who prefer a uniform series of labels will\r\nfind that a form like the following is as useful as any which they can\r\nadopt, and includes all necessary information. The size here given\r\nwill be adequate for almost all requirements, and is a \"happy medium\"\r\nbetween the small tickets upon which we have animadverted, and the\r\nenormous ones with which some botanists think it necessary to accompany\r\ntheir specimens. Care should be taken to avoid the possibility of a\r\nmisplacement of labels; many serious blunders have arisen from the\r\nneglect of due precaution in this matter.\r\n\r\n  Herb. John Smith.\r\n\r\n  Ranunculus acris, L.\r\n\r\n      & R. Steveni, Reich.\r\n\r\n  Loc. Meadows near Barchester.\r\n\r\n                  Date, June 30, 1874.\r\n\r\n  Coll. John Smith.\r\n\r\n_Arrangement._--The plants, being now affixed to their respective\r\nsheets and duly labelled, are ready to be placed in covers, and\r\nrendered available for ready reference. Each genus will require a\r\nseparate cover, which may well be of somewhat stouter paper than\r\nthat on which the plants are mounted; the name of the genus should\r\nbe written at the left-hand corner, followed by a reference to the\r\npage of the manual by which the plants are arranged, or to the number\r\nwhich it bears in the \"London Catalogue,\" if that be employed in\r\ntheir arrangement--a purpose for which it is very suitable. Should\r\nthe species be represented by more than one sheet, it is convenient\r\nto inclose each in a cover of thinner paper, which may bear the\r\nnumber assigned to the plant in the right-hand corner; and it is\r\nalso convenient to write the name of the plant at the bottom of each\r\nsheet, and to number it also in the right-hand corner. These details\r\nmay appear trivial, but they in reality affect in no small degree the\r\nreadiness with which any species may be referred to. Should the plants\r\nbe arranged in accordance with the \"London Catalogue,\" a copy should be\r\nkept with the herbarium, in which the plants should be ticked off, so\r\nthat it may serve as a catalogue of the species represented.\r\n\r\n_Cabinets._--It will of course be necessary to provide some\r\naccommodation for our specimens, and for this purpose we shall find\r\nno better model than the cabinets in use in the Botanical Department\r\nof the British Museum. The accompanying figure (drawn to scale) is an\r\nexact representation of one of these. The measurements can of course\r\nbe modified so as to suit the size of the herbarium sheets. Each\r\nshelf is a separate drawer, which with its contents can be taken out\r\nand replaced at will. Two cabinets such as that figured will be found\r\namply sufficient to contain a very good British herbarium. At Kew the\r\ncabinets employed are somewhat similar, but their height is greater and\r\nthe shelves are fixed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 35. Cabinet for Herbarium Sheets.]\r\n\r\nThe above are the principal points connected with the arrangement of a\r\nherbarium, considered as distinct from the work of collecting. It is\r\npossible that I may have omitted to touch upon certain details which\r\nmay occur to the amateur; should such be the case, I may add that I\r\nshall be happy to supply any additional information, either by letter\r\nor by word of mouth; or to show the system adopted at the British\r\nMuseum to anyone who may call upon me there for further hints upon the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX.\r\n\r\nGRASSES, ETC.\r\n\r\nBy Professor Buckman, F.G.S., etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nGrasses form such a distinct group of plants, and their study is so\r\noften undertaken for special purposes, that a few remarks upon their\r\ncollection and preservation can hardly be considered as out of place in\r\nthis little manual.\r\n\r\nDelicately as grasses are formed, yet it cannot be said that their\r\ntissues are so liable to injury, or their colours so evanescent, as\r\nthose of the flowering plants which the botanist ordinarily delights\r\nin. Nor indeed are the grasses so succulent as many other herbs. In\r\nthis respect they may be said to hold a place between ferns and those\r\nplants which usually are called flowers.\r\n\r\nAgain, in the dried state their organs are generally so well preserved\r\nas to present all that a botanist can wish for, for identification\r\nas well as arrangement; and the student of grasses ever finds his\r\ncollection to contain beauties not only in point of rarity, but as\r\nregards delicacy of structure and grace of outline.\r\n\r\nViewing them in this light alone, we have often been astonished that\r\nso many students of plants pay so little attention to them, and this\r\nfeeling is enhanced when the great value of the grasses is considered.\r\n\r\nIf then a few simple directions for preserving these plants shall have\r\nthe effect of winning a convert to these views, we shall be delighted;\r\nand to this end we shall make our descriptions as plain as our process\r\nhas ever been easy and simple, and yet complete.\r\n\r\nIn collecting grasses, as in other tribes of plants, it will be\r\nnecessary that our specimens should be chosen with the view to exhibit\r\nevery feature of interest. With this aim, then, it will be best in the\r\ngeneral way to obtain as much of the plant as possible, so that it\r\nmay be necessary to get them up by the roots. Still, in many species\r\nthe root is not of much importance: but there are a few which possess\r\nrhizomata, or underground stems; such as the _Triticum repens_, _Poa\r\npratensis_, _P. compressa_, _Holcus mollis_, _Agrostis stolonifera_,\r\nand others. These should always exhibit these parts; and as such\r\nexamples are usually agrarian, it is easier to mark down desirable\r\nspecimens and seek a fork at the neighbouring farm-buildings wherewith\r\nto completely get them out, than to carry any substitute in a smaller\r\nand less perfect implement.\r\n\r\nHaying made these remarks, we will suppose that we are now about to\r\nsally forth in search of grasses; in which case we make the following\r\npreparations.\r\n\r\nAs we do not file our copy of the 'Times' we make use of it as\r\ncollecting-paper as follows:--Each side of the paper is cut in two,\r\nor, as a Cockney would say, \"in half.\" Each half is then folded into\r\na double collecting-sheet, and as many of these are taken as are\r\nlikely to be useful. In each of these papers is put a small slip of\r\nwriting-paper, on which to note the locality and any other noteworthy\r\nfact connected with a specimen when put in the paper. These papers,\r\nseparately folded, are placed with the open ends inwards in a\r\nconvenient portfolio, and the collector is ready to take the field.\r\n\r\nOf course there will be those who will advocate Bentall's drying-paper,\r\nblotting-paper, and so on, and we would not have it supposed that we\r\ndespise these luxuries; but as we have found the plan advocated always\r\nto answer the purpose for grasses, we have felt independent of the more\r\nrefined collecting-papers.\r\n\r\nNow let us suppose that we have gathered fifty specimens, and have\r\nreturned home. The next thing will be to put them as soon as may be in\r\na position for drying.\r\n\r\nOur drying apparatus then consists of half-a-dozen smoothly planed\r\ndeal boards, and for our first collection we take two of these, and\r\nupon one we lay some few folds of our old 'Times' then a specimen\r\nin their papers (having previously improved their arrangement, when\r\nnecessary), and then some more folds of paper, and proceed as before,\r\nuntil all the specimens have been placed; then put a board on the top\r\nsheet, and upon that a stone, or a 7 or 14 lb. weight, according to\r\nthe size and quantity of the specimens. If another day's collection of\r\nspecimens be made before the foregoing are dry, they may be arranged in\r\nthe same way on the top board, and another board used and the weight\r\nreplaced. The object of this is to keep partially dried from fresh\r\nspecimens, the putting together of which is a fertile source of mildew\r\nand decay.\r\n\r\nIn arranging our specimens for the herbarium, we procure sheets of\r\ncartridge paper 18 inches long by 11 inches wide, using a folded sheet\r\nfor each species.\r\n\r\nIn these papers the specimens are fastened down in the following manner:\r\n\r\nGum over a portion of the cartridge paper (so as to have the same\r\ncolour) with two consecutive coats of a clean solution of gum-arabic.\r\n\r\nThis can be cut into slips of any length and breadth, making them as\r\nnarrow as possible for the sake of neatness, and when the specimen is\r\nplaced in its paper, a few of these slips may be made to confine it in\r\nthe desired position. Each example is then to be labelled at the bottom\r\nof the sheet, and each label should set forth--_a_, Its botanical\r\nname; _b_, its trivial or local name; _c_, the locality whence it was\r\nobtained; _d_, the date when gathered; added to which, if presented,\r\nthe donor's name.[H]\r\n\r\n[H] Printed herbarium labels may be got at Messrs. Hardwicke and\r\nBogue's, the publishers.\r\n\r\nThe sheets so prepared may be arranged in groups or genera, each being\r\nfolded in convenient paper or cloth wrappers, and the whole arranged in\r\nvolumes of stiff covered portfolio.\r\n\r\nThis, then, is all that seems to us necessary in the collection and\r\npreservation of grasses; but we would recommend the student, if an\r\nartist, to make a typical specimen of each sit for its portrait. In\r\nthis way we have made drawings of all the species and varieties that\r\nhave come in our way.\r\n\r\nOur drawings are life-size, usually lined in with Indian ink with a\r\nfine \"lithographic pen.\" These we partially colour on the spot.\r\n\r\nThe anatomical details are much enlarged and always fully coloured.\r\nTo this end our _impedimenta_ for a day among the grasses consist of,\r\nbesides the collecting portfolio, a sketching block, large octavo size,\r\nand a small box of soft colours. Armed with these we have made many a\r\ndrawing of a grass under the shade of a tree, or in the parlour of some\r\ncontiguous inn.\r\n\r\nLastly, we would venture to remark, if, besides the interest which\r\ngrasses should have for the student of botany, these plants be viewed,\r\nas they have ever been by us, as indicators of the nature of soil\r\nand the value and capabilities of the land on which they grow, the\r\ncollector should not fail to make notes connected with the soil,\r\nsituation, and other practical facts connected with the habitats of\r\nGrasses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI.\r\n\r\nMOSSES.\r\n\r\nBy Dr. Braithwaite, F.L.S., etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn making a collection of the vegetable productions of a country we\r\nfind considerable differences in the structure of the various groups\r\nof plants, and in the tissues of which they are composed; and hence\r\nspecial manipulation is requisite in dealing with certain orders.\r\nSome are of so succulent a nature, or have a framework so easily\r\ndisintegrated, that they contain within themselves the elements of\r\ndestruction, and present the greatest difficulty in satisfactory\r\npreservation, while others are so slightly acted on by external agents,\r\nthat little trouble is required to prepare specimens of permanent\r\nbeauty.\r\n\r\nThe Ferns and Lycopods, being generally appropriated by the collector\r\nof flowering plants, will be treated on with the latter, and following\r\nthese come the Mosses, to which we will now direct attention, taking\r\nthe alliance in its broadest sense, as including the three groups of\r\nFrondose Mosses, Bog Mosses, and Liver Mosses, or Hepaticæ, all of\r\nwhich are readily collected and preserved, and yield an endless fund\r\nof instructive entertainment to the microscopist. But it may be asked,\r\nWhere is the game to be found? Where are the pleasant hunting-grounds\r\nin which they most do congregate? We answer, everywhere may some\r\nspecies or other be met with; yet, though many are cosmopolitan, the\r\nmajority have their special habitats, and some their special seasons,\r\nboth being considerably influenced by the presence of moisture.\r\n\r\n_Collecting._--The bryologist has one advantage over the phænogamous\r\nbotanist, for it is not imperative that mosses should be laid out and\r\npressed immediately; and hence less care is required in collecting\r\nthem, than is bestowed on flowering plants; the necessary apparatus is\r\nconfined to a pocket-knife, to remove specimens from stones or trees,\r\na stock of stout waste paper, and a vasculum, or, better still, a\r\nstrong bag, in which to carry the packets. When collecting the plants,\r\nit is well to remove any superfluous earth or stones, or to squeeze\r\nout the water from those found in bogs; and then each is to be wrapped\r\nseparately in paper, and the locality marked outside; or the more\r\nminute species may, for greater safety, be placed in chip boxes. On\r\nreaching home, if we do not prepare the specimens at once, we must\r\nnot leave the parcels packed together in their receptacle, or mould\r\nwill soon attack them and spoil the whole; but we must spread them out\r\non the floor until quite dry, and then reserve them to a convenient\r\nopportunity to lay out; as in the dry state they may be kept for years\r\nunchanged.\r\n\r\nIt often happens that our line of study is developed by some fortuitous\r\ncircumstance. A neglected flowerpot in the corner of the garden\r\nattracts attention by its verdant carpet of moss, or, peeping over the\r\nwall, we see the crevices between the bricks bristling with capsules of\r\n_Tortula muralis_, the red twisted peristome freshly brought to view\r\nby the falling away of the lid, and, taking a bit indoors to submit to\r\nthe microscope, we are so captivated therewith that we then and there\r\ndetermine to become a bryologist. Nor is this all that a journey round\r\nthe garden will disclose: the neglected paths yield other species not\r\nless worthy of examination, and old apple-trees are not unfrequently\r\ntenanted by mosses.\r\n\r\nExtending our walks to the commons, lanes, and woods, we may find on\r\nthe ground and banks, in bogs and on the stumps and trunks of trees, a\r\nnumber of species greatly extending our list; while others again are\r\nonly met with on the clay soil of stubble-fields, as various species of\r\n_Pottia_ and _Ephemerum_: appearing in October, their delicate texture\r\nis developed by the constant moisture of winter, and with it also they\r\nvanish, to appear no more until the succeeding season. Travelling yet\r\nfarther away, we find that each locality we visit yields some novelty:\r\nold walls and rocks of sandstone or slate, limestone districts, and,\r\nabove all, a mountainous country, are rich in species we seek in vain\r\nelsewhere. Here peat bogs, and rocks dripping with water, ever supplied\r\nby the atmosphere, or the tumbling streams everywhere met with, are the\r\nchosen homes of these little plants, and thither must the collector\r\nresort, if he would reap his richest harvest. Winter and spring in the\r\nlowlands, and a later period in the elevated districts, will be found\r\nmost productive of fruiting plants.\r\n\r\n_Preparation of Specimens._--So rapidly does the cellular texture\r\nof the mosses transmit fluid, that, when soaked in water, we see\r\nthem swell up and expand their little leaves, and in a short time\r\nlook as fresh as when growing; hence a basin of water, a towel, and\r\ndrying-paper are all we require to prepare our specimens for the\r\nherbarium. If the tufts are large, we must separate them into patches\r\nsufficiently thin to lie flat, and by repeated washing, get rid of\r\nadherent earth, mud, or gravel. This is conveniently accomplished by\r\nholding the tuft in the palm of the hand, under a tap, and allowing a\r\nstream of water to pass through it; then by pressure in the folding\r\ntowel we remove superfluous moisture and immediately transfer to paper,\r\narranging the plants as we wish them to lie permanently, and placing\r\nwith each a ticket bearing the name: a moderate weight is sufficient to\r\ndry them, as with great pressure the capsules split, and thus the value\r\nof the specimen is decreased. It not unfrequently happens that two or\r\nthree species grow intermixed: these must be carefully separated at the\r\ntime of soaking, and any capsules required to show the peristome must\r\nalso be removed before the plants are submitted to pressure.\r\n\r\n_Examination of Specimens._--We have very much to learn about a moss\r\nbefore we can become masters of all the characters that pertain to it\r\nas a specific individual. We must observe its branching, the mode of\r\nattachment of the leaves to the stem, and their direction; the form\r\nand structure of a separate leaf, the position of the male flowers,\r\nand, lastly, the position and structure of the fruit. For the efficient\r\ndetermination of these we require a microscope (the simple dissecting\r\nmicroscope is amply sufficient), a couple of sharp-edged, triangular\r\nneedles fixed in handles, and a few glass slides and covers. Having\r\nsoaked our specimen in water, we lay it on a slide, and by cutting\r\nthrough the stem with one of the needles, close to the attachment of\r\na leaf, we can readily remove the leaf entire, and two or three may\r\nbe transferred to another slide, and placed in a drop of water under a\r\ncover: the same thing may be roughly accomplished by scraping the stem\r\nbackwards with one of the needles; but in this way the leaves are often\r\ntorn.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 36. _Tortula muralis._\r\n\r\n_a._ Leaf and its areolation. _b._ Capsule. _c._ Calyptra. _d._ Lid.\r\n_e._ Male flower. _f._ Antheridia and paraphyses.]\r\n\r\nBy examination of a leaf we notice its form, the condition of its\r\nmargin, whether entire or serrated or bordered; the presence and\r\nextent of the nerve; and lastly, and most important of all, the form\r\nand condition of its component cells; and for this a higher power is\r\nrequired. With a 2/3-inch object-glass and C eyepiece we can observe\r\ntheir form, and whether their walls are thickened so as to render them\r\ndot-like; their contents, whether chlorophyllose or hyaline; and their\r\nsurface, whether smooth or covered with papillæ; for often these points\r\nare so characteristic, that by them alone we can at once refer a barren\r\nspecimen to its proper family or genus.\r\n\r\n_Preservation of Specimens._--This may be discussed under two heads:\r\n1st, as microscopic objects; 2nd, for the herbarium.\r\n\r\n1. The parts required for microscopic examination are the capsules\r\nand peristome, entire specimens of the smaller species, and detached\r\nleaves. The capsules having to be viewed by condensed light, must be\r\nmounted dry as opaque objects; and for this purpose I use Piper's\r\nwooden slides, with revolving bone cover; and in one of these we\r\nmay fix a capsule with the lid still attached, another laid on its\r\nside, but showing the peristome, and a third with the mouth of the\r\ncapsule looking upward, a position very useful for the species of\r\n_Orthotrichum_, as we are thus enabled to see the inner peristome; and\r\nwith them also may be placed the calyptra: should the cost of these be\r\nan object, a cheaper substitute may be found in shallow pill-boxes,\r\nblackened on the inside.\r\n\r\nTo preserve the leaves in an expanded state we may employ the fluid\r\nmedia used for vegetable tissues, or, when time is of consequence,\r\nRimmington's glycerine jelly is a convenient material in which to\r\nmount them, a ring of dammar cement being first placed on the slide,\r\nand within this the liquefied jelly, to which the expanded specimen\r\nis quickly transferred, and the cover securely sealed by gold size.\r\nPreparations of this kind are of the highest value as types for\r\ncomparison with actual specimens we may have for determination.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 37. _Ceratodon purpureus._\r\n\r\n_a._ Male plant. 1. Leaf and its areolation. 2. Capsule. 3. Calyptra 4.\r\nTwo teeth of the peristome.]\r\n\r\n2. In mounting specimens for the herbarium we must be guided by the\r\nlimits which we have fixed on for the extent of the same; and I may\r\nfirst describe the method adopted for my own collection. Every\r\nspecies has a separate leaf of cartridge-paper measuring 14-1/2 ×\r\n10-1/2 inches, and on this the specimens are fixed, each mounted by\r\na little gum on a piece of toned paper; thus 4 or 6 to 12 specimens,\r\naccording to size, are attached to each leaf,--varieties have one\r\nor more additional leaves; and to each is also fixed a triangular\r\nenvelope, inclosing loose capsules and leaves for ready transfer to the\r\nmicroscope, and also a label indicating the name, habitat, and date of\r\ncollection. A pink cover for each genus includes the species, and a\r\nstout millboard cover embraces the genera of each family, with the name\r\nof which it is labelled outside, the whole shutting up in a cabinet.\r\n\r\nAnother form is that seen in Rabenhorst's Bryotheca Europæa, quarto\r\nvolumes of 50 specimens, one occupying each leaf, and so arranged that\r\nthe specimens do not come opposite to each other. Others again use\r\nloose sheets of note-paper, within each of which a single specimen\r\nis mounted; but this, from their size, is very cumbersome. Or we may\r\ntake a single well-chosen typical specimen and arrange many species\r\non a page, as is seen in the beautiful volume of Gardiner's 'British\r\nMosses' or McIvor's 'Hepaticæ Britannicæ.' Whatever plan we adopt, our\r\nspecimens, once well dried and kept in a dry place, are unchangeable,\r\nand are always looked upon with pleasure, each recalling some pleasing\r\nassociations, or perchance reminding us of some long-lost friend, in\r\ncompanionship with whom they were collected or studied. A stock of\r\nduplicates must also be reserved, from which to supply our friends, or\r\nexchange with other collectors for desiderata in our own series: these\r\nmay be kept in square cases of various sizes, cut so as to allow the\r\nedges of the top and sides to wrap over the other half folded down on\r\nthe specimens.\r\n\r\nThe Hepaticæ of the family Jungermanniaceæ are treated precisely\r\nas mosses, the capsules, however, show but little diversity, and\r\nwill not require separate preservation; but the elaters, or spiral\r\nthreads accompanying the seeds, are elegant microscopic objects. The\r\nMarchantiaceæ must be pressed when fresh, as they do not revive with\r\nthe same facility as other species, owing to their succulent nature and\r\nnumerous layers of cells.\r\n\r\n_Classification._--On this I have fully treated elsewhere (\"The Moss\r\nWorld,\" 'Popular Science Review,' Oct., 1871), and it may suffice\r\nhere simply to indicate the families of British mosses and their\r\nmode of arrangement. The cell-texture of the leaf takes an important\r\nplace in the characters, and in accordance with this principle the\r\nCleistocarpous or Phascoid group is broken up and distributed in\r\nvarious families. We have two orders; one indeed, comprising only the\r\ngenus _Andreæa_, is distinguished by the capsule splitting into four\r\nvalves united at apex; the other, including the bulk of the species,\r\nhas in most cases a lid, which separates transversely, and usually\r\ndiscloses a peristome of tooth-like processes. The structure of these\r\nteeth again enables us to form three divisions. In the first they\r\nconsist of a mass of confluent cells; in the second, of tongue-shaped\r\nprocesses, composed of agglutinated filaments; and in the third, of\r\na double layer of cells, transversely articulated to each other, the\r\nouter layer composed of two rows of firm coloured cells, the inner of\r\na single series of vesicular hyaline cells, on which the hygroscopic\r\nquality of the tooth depends.\r\n\r\n           Sub-Class SPHAGNINÆ.\r\n                Bog Mosses.\r\n           Fam. 1.--Sphagnaceæ.\r\n\r\n             Sub-Class BRYINÆ.\r\n              Frondose Mosses.\r\n\r\n  Order 1.--Schistocarpi.\r\n            Fam. 1.--Andreæaceæ.\r\n\r\n  Order 2.--Stegocarpi.\r\n       Div. 1.--Elasmodontes.\r\n            Fam. 2.

Smith, F.L.S.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the fogs and rains of autumn the fungologist's harvest begins. A\r\nfew fungi (large and small) appertain to the spring, and some species\r\nmay be found in every month of the year; but it is not till September\r\nhas well set in, or October is reached, that the glut of fungi is\r\nreally upon us. Fungi may generally be met with in abundance for\r\nthree months of the year; viz. from the latter half of September till\r\nthe middle of December, the month of October taking pre-eminence for\r\nproducing the greatest abundance of species. A season of moderate heat\r\nand rain is the most productive, for an excessive amount of either\r\ndryness or moisture appears to destroy the fecundity of the mycelium,\r\nwhich it must always be remembered is alive and at work (underground)\r\nthe whole of the year; for, as a matter of course, this year's fungi\r\nis produced from last year's spores. These spores are set free in\r\nautumn, and at once vegetate and form masses of mycelium, from which\r\nnext years crop must spring; just as the seeds of our wild annuals are\r\nself-sown at the fall of each year and first germinate at that season.\r\nIt is a great mistake to suppose that Agarics and Boleti wait till\r\nthe leaves fall, so that they may prey upon them; for, as a rule, the\r\nlarger fungi never live upon the leaves of the same year as that in\r\nwhich they (the fungi) come up; fungi live upon the fallen leaves of\r\nthe previous autumn. The spring and summer months will sometimes prove\r\nvery productive, especially after stormy weather; but the collector\r\nmust always bear in mind that fungi, like all other things, have\r\ntheir _seasons_. I have known the fungus harvest quite over by the\r\nend of August, and I have also known it not come in before December:\r\nit depends entirely upon a certain amount of atmospheric heat and\r\nmoisture. A damp summer and stormy August will produce the crop at\r\nthe beginning of September; but a dry autumn, without much rain till\r\nNovember, will delay the fungus crop till Christmas. Some species\r\nappear regularly _twice_ a year from the same mycelium; once after the\r\nrains of March and April, and again in October. This is the case with\r\n_Coprinus atramentarius_, which I have growing (originally from spores)\r\nin a bed of my own garden.\r\n\r\nIt is useless to go out specially to collect fungi, either during the\r\ndry hot weather of summer or the frosts of winter; it sometimes,\r\nhowever, happens that odd fungi may be found here and there, in\r\nout-of-the-way places, such as the sides of open cellars and sawpits,\r\nunder bridges, on prostrate logs in streams, in damp outhouses, or\r\nabout old water-butts, &c.; therefore I never go out without two or\r\nthree old seidlitz-powder boxes, some thin paper, and a strong knife,\r\nin case any waifs and strays should fall in my way. I have sometimes\r\nfound good species in a friend's dustbin or cistern, or upon the sides\r\nof the open cellar of a public-house. I once found an agaricus on\r\nthe cornice of London Bridge, to secure which I had to get over the\r\nparapet, and was nearly being taken into custody as one tired of life;\r\nanother time I found a colony of _Coprinus domesticus_ upon a friend's\r\nscullery wall, and a _Peziza_ upon my brother's ceiling. Moral:\r\nFungologists' pockets should, _at all times_, contain one or two small\r\nboxes for securing stray and erratic members of the fungus family.\r\n\r\nThe equipment for a fungus foray differs with the nature of the fungi\r\nto be collected. If the plants sought for are wholly microscopic, a\r\nsmall vasculum, knife, pocket-lens, and package of thin paper will be\r\nfound sufficient; but if Agarics, Boleti, the larger Polyporei, &c.,\r\nare to be brought home, a more complete set of things will be required,\r\nwhich should include a very small garden-trowel or carpenter's gouge\r\n(any saddler or bootmaker will make a suitable leather case for the\r\nblades for a shilling or two), a strong knife--such as gardeners use\r\nfor pruning trees, a few sheets of thin paper, a lens, pocket-compass,\r\nand some string. If truffles are desired, a rake is necessary, and the\r\nbest plan is to carry the iron-toothed end separately in a leather\r\ncase, and made to screw on to the end of a walking-stick; when not\r\nin use, this end can be carried in the pocket with the trowel, &c.\r\nIt is requisite that the vasculum be large, with straps to carry it\r\nover the shoulders; and the collector should be provided with a set of\r\ncardboard boxes, large and small, to go inside the vasculum, and to\r\ncontain the more delicate or choice spoils of the day. Leather gloves\r\nand a thin great-coat are good things for the chilly days of early\r\nwinter--this coat should be provided with at least four large pockets;\r\nand, if the weather is inclement, strong boots and waterproof leggings\r\nwill be found serviceable. An old felt hat and large cotton umbrella\r\nare also desirable, for it is only a piece of folly to go into the\r\nwet dripping woods with good clothes. As for the umbrella, it should\r\nbe one of the Mrs. Gamp pattern, of good size, and with a (removable)\r\nring at the end farthest from the handle, so that it may be suspended\r\nfrom branches of trees, &c., whilst the fungi are sorted or examined\r\nbelow, or a frugal luncheon is discussed (perhaps during a passing\r\nstorm of rain). The string will be found useful for tying up the larger\r\nPolyporei; these are frequently of great size, and often weigh many\r\npounds. In collecting, all Agarics should be kept separate as much as\r\npossible; for this purpose thin paper, such as is used by stationers\r\nand milliners, is indispensable; every specimen should be wrapped very\r\nlightly in a piece of thin paper before boxing, as the elasticity of\r\nthe paper not only prevents breaking and bruising, but it also prevents\r\nthe spores of one species being scattered over another. In carrying\r\nfungi about, or sending fresh specimens from one place to another,\r\nnothing is so good as this thin paper interspersed here and there with\r\nfronds of the common bracken. Sawdust, hay, or wool, should never, on\r\nany account, be used: such things totally destroy the plants; but with\r\ncareful packing with paper and bracken-fronds, fungi may be transported\r\nfor any distance, by rail or otherwise, perfectly intact and undamaged.\r\nIn packing the vasculum, see that the heavier plants are at the bottom\r\nand the lighter ones at the top; for if packed otherwise any fragile\r\nspecies will be certainly destroyed. I have known a good collection\r\nof Agarics rendered worthless by a loose puff-ball being placed with\r\nthem, which has rolled about with every movement of the collector's\r\nbody, and damaged big and little species alike, when a piece of paper\r\nor a fern-frond or two, to prevent rolling, would have kept all quite\r\nsafe.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to specify localities, because fungi abound\r\neverywhere. If leaf fungi are sought for, hedge-sides will produce an\r\nabundant crop; if the Agaricini and Polyporei, forests and woods must\r\nbe ransacked; if the edible species are wanted, rich open pastures\r\n(with few exceptions) must be traversed: the various species of\r\ntruffles must be looked for principally in leafy glades--many prefer\r\na calcareous subsoil, but at times they may be met with even in\r\nhedge-sides, town parks, or elsewhere.\r\n\r\nWhen the collection of the day is complete, no species must be allowed\r\nto remain in the collecting-cases all night; for if the boxes are\r\nnot carefully opened and the contents laid out, it will probably be\r\nfound in the morning that some will have dissolved into an inky fluid,\r\nothers will have got into the treacle state, whilst a third lot will be\r\noverrun with mould, or the smaller ones perhaps entirely eaten up by\r\nslugs or larvæ. Few things decompose so rapidly as fungi, especially\r\nthe full-grown Boleti; these, though apparently perfectly sound one\r\nday, will sometimes be a horrible mass of foetid treacle the next.\r\nI have sometimes received large parcels by rail or post when this\r\nhorrible stinking matter has been dripping out, perhaps all over the\r\ncarter's hands or down the postman's trousers; for _ladies_ always\r\n_will_ send Boleti in bonnet-boxes, tied with thin twine. Should any\r\nextra charge be demanded, on the ground of the insufficiently prepaid\r\npostage, or the parcels be unpaid, I invariably refuse to take them in,\r\nto the disgust of the parties bringing them. I shall not soon forget\r\nan ill-tempered postman who brought me two of these dripping treasures\r\nat the same time last autumn, with a demand for extra postage, and his\r\nlook of silent disrelish as he walked off with one twine-suspended\r\nbonnet-box in each hand, the fragrant Boleti-treacle meanwhile\r\nmanifesting itself upon the pavement. Even when quite fresh, the odour\r\nof some species is disgusting in the extreme; for instance, a single\r\nspecimen of _Phallus impudicus_ in the collecting-box will affect a\r\nwhole railway carriage with the most horrible and sickening stench;\r\nwhilst the curious truffle _Melanogaster ambiguus_ is perhaps worse\r\nstill, for its abominable odour is perfectly insufferable.\r\n\r\nTo dry and preserve a collection of fresh fungi is at times a very\r\ndifficult task; for instance, some species are so entirely covered with\r\na tenacious gluten that if they were at once put between drying-papers,\r\nit is certain they would never come out again with the least chance\r\nof being recognized by even the most acute fungologist; others are so\r\ndeliquescent that in an hour or two they would dissolve into a watery\r\nmass, soak through all the paper, and leave a mere dirty stain between\r\nthe sheets where the plant was originally placed. As a contrast,\r\nsome of the Polyporei (as the young state of _Polyporus igniarius_)\r\nare so hard that nothing but a steam-hammer would have any chance of\r\nflattening them. There is considerable difficulty in ridding the plants\r\nfrom the larvæ with which they are often infested. A few drops of the\r\noil of turpentine will, however, generally drive them from Agarics\r\nand other fleshy fungi; and, in regard to the woody Polyporei, a good\r\nplan is to place the plants in an oven, or on a hob for a short time,\r\nwhere the heat is not too powerful to destroy the plants, but still\r\nsufficiently potent to drive the larvæ from their holes. If this is\r\nnot done, the collector's experience will probably be the same as\r\nmine has more than once been; viz. on opening a package (which should\r\ncontain some choice dried fungus), to find only a stain, a few skins\r\nof dead maggots, and a little dirt--in fact, some of the species in\r\nmy herbarium, though mostly poisoned with corrosive sublimate, get\r\nentirely devoured by rapacious and poison-proof larvæ, mites, and\r\nminute beetles.\r\n\r\nIn addition, however, to the mere drying, certain notes and particulars\r\nare required, without which the best dried specimens are worthless;\r\nand, again, for the larger fungi to be of real service, the spores of\r\neach species must be separately preserved. As regards the drying of the\r\nfleshy fungi themselves, the process to observe is as follows:--Lay\r\nall ordinary Agarics out separately in a dry place, or in a current of\r\ndry air from six to twelve, or even twenty-four hours, according to\r\nthe species, so that they may part with their superfluous moisture,\r\nand thus facilitate drying. In the case of species with glutinous\r\npilei, it will be found that the gluten will more or less set, if\r\ncarefully attended to, in a dry warm place. If the larger fleshy\r\nfungi are inadvertently placed under a propagating-glass, or left on\r\na lawn or grassy place, or kept in damp air from over-night till next\r\nmorning, the chances are that they will never properly dry at all.\r\nWhen the superfluous moisture has evaporated they may be put gently\r\nbetween drying-papers, but the weight put upon them must at first be\r\nof the slightest kind; ordinary books, more or less light, will be\r\nfound quite sufficient; and few, or perhaps no other plants, require\r\nsuch frequent changing as Agarics. An hour, or often less, suffices\r\nfor the first pressure, when care must be taken to supply them with\r\nfresh and perfectly dry paper, or they will immediately mould. It is\r\na good plan, when the plants are half dry, to take them out of the\r\npapers and put them in dry air, or in a sunny place for a short time\r\n(the length of time being determined by experience and the nature of\r\nthe species), to part with more of their moisture: so, with constant\r\nattention and frequent changing of the papers, very presentable\r\nspecimens may at last be obtained. These dried fungi will now be found\r\nvery useful for showing the more superficial characters of the plants;\r\nbut without sections, spores, and proper notes, they will be next to\r\nuseless. In Agarics it is of the first importance to show the nature\r\nof the attachment of the gills to the stem: and should the stems be\r\nfurnished with a volva or annulus, this must be preserved with the\r\ngreatest care--young specimens, too, in different stages of growth,\r\nare often of great value. If possible, it is well to have a series of\r\ndried specimens of each species; one, as in Fig. 38, A, to display\r\nthe nature of the tubes in Boletus and the gills in the Agaricini,\r\nwhether they are thick or thin, crowded together or distant from each\r\nother, plain or serrated, free or annexed; another, as at B, to show\r\nthe pileus, whether smooth or floccose, plain, warted, or zoned, and\r\nthe nature of the margin, whether striate, bullate, or plain; a third,\r\nas at C, to show the attachment of pileus to stem in infancy; and,\r\nfourthly, a section or thin slice removed from the exact middle of the\r\nyoung plant from top to bottom, as at D: this will show the nature of\r\nthe veil (if present), and whether universal or not; and if absent,\r\nwhether the margin is at first straight, incurved, or involute. A\r\nsimilar section through the mature plant is also required, E and F\r\n(Fig. 39): this will give the attachment of gills to stems (a character\r\nof great importance), and the nature of the stem itself, whether solid,\r\nstuffed, or hollow. Great care and experience are required to cut a\r\nthin and perfect slice from the middle of a tender Agaric or Boletus;\r\nfor there is often a sort of articulation at the point G, which\r\ncauses the slice to fall in two. As for preserving fungi in fluids,\r\nI think it in all ways undesirable. It may more or less answer for\r\nsingle or unique specimens, or for large museums, where space is of no\r\nconsequence; but for all purposes of constant reference and private\r\nstudy, any process of this sort is worthless. Few persons, I imagine,\r\nwould care to have hundreds (or I might say thousands) of tolerably\r\nlarge glass bottles of fluids in their houses. It is essential that\r\nthe spores should be secured, as their colour and size are very\r\nimportant. They may be preserved in various ways: if coloured, they are\r\nbest kept on white paper, and if white, on black glazed paper, such\r\nas is supplied to photographers; or they may be at once deposited and\r\nkept on glass slides and covered, or between thin sheets of mica, such\r\nas photographers use. I prefer the spores free on paper, as they can\r\neasily be transferred to glass for examination by breathing on a corner\r\nof a glass slide and just touching it on to the dry spores; thousands\r\nwill attach themselves to the glass, and, moreover, the supply from\r\none fungus appears to be perfectly inexhaustible. To secure a good\r\nbatch of spores, it is not sufficient to let the Agaric merely rest in\r\nthe position shown at H (Fig. 40), for the spores will not properly\r\nfall when this plan is adopted; a far better one is to cut a small\r\nhole, about the size of the diameter of the stem of the fungus, in\r\nthe centre of the paper on which the spores are to be deposited: slip\r\nthe stem through the hole, carefully draw up the paper collar, and\r\nsupport the fungus in a small pot, glass, or dry phial (placed under a\r\npropagating-glass to keep the plant fresh) as shown in Fig. 41. If it\r\nis wished to fix the spores, let the paper be first washed with a thin\r\nsolution of gum-arabic, which must be allowed to get perfectly dry; the\r\nspores may now fall upon the dry gummed paper; and after the deposition\r\nthe gummed surface must be breathed upon to moisten the gum, and when\r\nit has dried for the second time the spores will be fixed, and not\r\nreadily rubbed off.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 38. Specimens showing the gills, rings, and stages\r\nof growth.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 39. Section cut through Agaricus.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 40.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 41. Agaric placed to catch spores.]\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to prepare the woody specimens in a different manner.\r\nThey must first be perfectly dried before the fire, or in the sun, and\r\nthen a thin slice must be sawn (or cut with a powerful knife) out of\r\nthe middle. This slice may be poisoned, as described hereafter, and\r\nmounted on the herbarium sheets at once. If the Polyporus is very thin,\r\nit may be mounted in company with the slice, but more than one specimen\r\nis desirable, as it is indispensable to have both surfaces handy for\r\nexamination. If the specimens are very large, they are best kept in\r\nwooden boxes, and labelled according to the genera and sub-genera they\r\ncontain; or they may be kept in drawers, the drawers being divided by\r\npartitions if large, and labelled outside. If boxes are used, they\r\nshould all be the same depth; the height and width may be doubled or\r\nhalved according to the nature of the plants: the plan will be better\r\nunderstood by reference to the diagram, Fig. 42. If this plan is\r\nadopted, there will be no waste space, and the boxes will stand evenly\r\nupon a sideboard or against a wall.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 42. Cabinet for Fungi.]\r\n\r\nBefore the specimens are transferred to the herbarium they may or not\r\nbe poisoned, according to the wish or convenience of the collector.\r\nSome of my plants which have never been poisoned remain perfectly\r\nuninjured, whilst others, which have been treated with a strong\r\nsolution of corrosive sublimate, have been devoured by larvæ, &c.,\r\nintroduced, I presume, since the plants were put away. A solution of\r\ncorrosive sublimate in pyroligneous naphtha, carefully washed over the\r\nspecimens, has been recommended; but the ordinary poison is oil of\r\nturpentine, mixed with finely-powdered sublimate, well shaken before\r\napplied. If the specimens are to be glued down, they should be mounted\r\nas shown in Figs. 38 and 39, so as to display all their characters,\r\nand fixed with poisoned gum tragacanth; but some botanists, and\r\nmyself amongst the number, prefer to have the specimens _free_. For\r\nthis purpose I have envelopes gummed to the herbarium sheets, and the\r\nspecimens (including a small paper containing the spores) are free\r\nwithin the envelopes. Some mites are very fond of the spores of certain\r\nfungi, whilst they will not touch the spores of others: therefore,\r\nif the specimens are to be kept perfectly intact, gummed paper must\r\nbe used, or they may be kept between little slips of mica. As to the\r\nlabelling of the herbarium sheets, I shall not touch upon that, as the\r\nplan universally followed is similar to the one used for flowering\r\nplants, and described in this volume. Some sub-genera of Agaricus,\r\nhowever (as Tricholoma), are so numerous in species that it will be\r\nfound requisite to have several wrappers for one sub-genus.\r\n\r\nNow as to the necessary notes to be made on the sheets: the points in\r\ndiscriminating fungi differ considerably from those used in naming\r\nflowering plants. It is presumed the spores have been preserved by the\r\ncollector. Now, if he has time, the next best thing is to measure and\r\nnote them at once, in decimals of an inch and millimetre: a second\r\nand essential thing is a note as to the taste of the fungus, whether\r\nit is mild, acrid, bitter, &c. This point will be found very useful,\r\nas some species are tasteless, insipid, or extremely acrid, bitter,\r\nor poisonous: it is only necessary to taste a small piece; but as so\r\nlittle is really known of the qualities of fungi, unless this is done\r\nno advance will be made. I invariably taste every fungus new to me, and\r\nhave notes to this effect of all the species which have passed through\r\nmy hands: in some species the effect is very peculiar, sometimes (as\r\nin _Agaricus melleus_) it causes a cold sensation at the back of\r\nthe ears, and swelling of the throat; at others (as in _Marasmius\r\ncaulicinalis_), the taste proves to be intensely bitter; some are\r\nso fiery (as in _Lactarius turpis_, _blennius_, and _acris_), that\r\nthe smallest piece placed upon the tongue resembles the contact of a\r\nred-hot poker. Often, when I have been out botanizing with young men\r\nand amateurs, when a dubious _Russula_ or _Lactarius_ has been shown\r\nme to name, I have requested the inquirer to taste it, as, if mild or\r\npungent, the taste might at times decide the species; I have generally\r\nfound, however, that though certain persons are anxious enough to\r\nacquire _names_, they will not burn their tongues to secure them. No\r\nfungi that I am acquainted with are really pleasant raw, unless it is\r\n_Hydnum gelatinosum_, though many are very good when cooked. A very\r\nimportant thing to note is the odour in the larger fungi: many are very\r\npleasant, like meal; a few are sweet; some resemble stinking fish (as\r\n_Agaricus cucumis_); one, mice (as _A. incanus_); another, camphor,\r\nwhilst _Marasmius foetidus_ and _impudicus_ are like putrid carrion;\r\nothers are like burnt flannel, garlic, rotten beans, and almost every\r\nimaginable disagreeable thing. The habitat is of great importance: if\r\nthe plant grows upon trees, the tree should be named; or if parasitic\r\nupon any other material, the matrix should be named with the place.\r\nThe viscidity, dryness, or bibulosity must be given, and in the\r\n_Agaricini_, any notes that may suggest themselves as to the presence\r\nor absence of a veil, volva, or trama, and whether the gills have a\r\nhabit of separating from the stem, as at J (Fig. 39), must be carefully\r\nnoted.\r\n\r\nThe study of the larger fungi has been to me one of the greatest\r\npleasures of my life: when all things else have failed, this has never\r\nfailed; it has taken me into the pleasantest of places and amongst the\r\nbest of people. Had it not been for fungi, I should have been dead\r\nyears ago; often tired, jaded, and harassed with business matters,\r\na stroll in the rich autumn woods has given me a renewed lease of\r\nlife. In these favourite haunts I never tire or flag; rain, fog,\r\nand mud, never detract from the pleasures of the woods to me--I am\r\nonly depressed in the hot, dry weather of midsummer. In the autumn I\r\nconstantly visit the forests, with all my collecting paraphernalia; I\r\nsometimes take a saw to cut off the big, woody, fungus excrescences of\r\ntrees. I was once fortunate enough to find a ladder in a wood, which\r\nproved invaluable for ascending the beeches in search of _Agaricus\r\nmucidus_, &c. I, however, find fungi everywhere: I only go round the\r\ncorner, and there they are. I often visit a neighbouring builder's\r\nyard, and descend the sawpits, to the amazement of the operatives:\r\nsome of the rarest species of our Flora, and many new ones, I have\r\nfound within a few minutes' walk of my own house. I once found a rare\r\n_Lentinus_ on a log as it was being carted down King William Street,\r\nand a year or so ago an undescribed _Peziza_ flourished inside my\r\ncistern.\r\n\r\nCollecting fungi is not without its humours as well as its pleasures,\r\nas the following will show. I once saw a portly, well-dressed gentleman\r\nwalking along the high road, with his vasculum over his shoulders, and\r\ncarrying home (one in each hand) a pair of cast-off, rotten boots,\r\ndiscarded by some vagrant; the rotting leather having produced a crop\r\nof rare microscopic fungi. At times abominable cast-off foetid gipsy\r\nrags will be lovingly taken from out a ditch, and choice pieces cut out\r\nand consigned to the vasculum of the cryptogamic botanist; at other\r\ntimes some rare species will be seen \"up a tree,\" and it has several\r\ntimes happened in my presence that one enthusiastic botanist has got\r\non to the shoulders of another to secure a prize, or even waded into\r\na pond to get at some prostrate fungus-bearing log. The humours of\r\ntruffle hunting are manifold. I have seen a gentleman trespass, on\r\nhands and knees, through a holly hedge, on to a gentleman's lawn,\r\nand there dig up the turf in some promising spot, risking an attack\r\nfrom the house-dog, or a few shots from the proprietor; the said\r\ntrespasser meanwhile armed with a rake, gouge, and dangerous-looking\r\nopen knife. Country labourers are often sorely puzzled by the acts of\r\ncryptogamic botanists; they stand agape in utter amazement to witness\r\npoisonous \"frog-stools\" bagged by the score. Ofttimes one gets warned\r\nthat the plants are \"deadly pisin\"; but collectors are usually looked\r\nupon as harmless lunatics, a climax in this direction generally being\r\nreached if a gentleman in search of _Ascoboli_ and the dung-borne\r\n_Pezizæ_, sits down, and after making a promising collection of horse\r\nor cow-dung, carefully wraps these treasures in tissue paper, and puts\r\nthem in his \"sandwich-box.\"\r\n\r\nOne word of warning to the beginner--never, on any account, amass\r\nand put away a lot of imperfect materials with insufficient notes,\r\nfor in the end they will prove worse than useless. To name fungi\r\nwith certainty the fullest notes and most complete materials are\r\nindispensable: without these nothing whatever can be done. It is far\r\nbetter to laboriously make out twenty species, and know them in all\r\ntheir aspects for certain, than to amass imperfect materials of two\r\nthousand without any sound botanical knowledge. If the former course\r\nis pursued, the study of fungi will prove a never-failing source of\r\npleasure to the mind and of health to the body.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I cannot do better than quote a few words written by the\r\nillustrious Fries (now more than eighty years of age) in the preface\r\nto a recent work of his on Fungi. He says: \"Now in the evening of my\r\nlife, I rejoice to call to mind the abundant pleasures which my study\r\nof the more perfect fungi, sustained for more than half a century, has\r\nthroughout this long time afforded me.... Therefore, to botanists,\r\nwho can wander at will the country side, I commend the study of these\r\nplants as a perennial fountain of delight and admiration for that\r\nSupreme Wisdom which reigns over universal nature.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII.\r\n\r\nLICHENS.\r\n\r\nBy the Rev. Jas. Crombie, F.L.S., etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nMuch as it is to be regretted, it cannot be questioned that of those\r\nwho have devoted themselves to the study of botany, lichenists have\r\nalways been \"few and far between.\" While flowering plants have had\r\ntheir hosts of enthusiastic students, and while other classes of\r\ncryptogamics have had due attention paid to them, the study of lichens\r\nhas, up even to the present time, been but too much neglected. To many\r\nindeed the term conveys only some faint and confused idea, and though\r\nthey know that there are plants so called, they are at the same time\r\nutterly ignorant of their nature. With flowering plants, ferns, mosses,\r\nseaweeds, and even fungi, they have at least some acquaintance, more or\r\nless accurate; but lichens they generally pass by with indifference,\r\nregarding them merely as \"time-stains\" on the trees, the walls, and\r\nthe rocks where they grow. Nay, we have even met with some professed,\r\nand otherwise well-informed botanists, who, while recognizing certain\r\nof the larger and more conspicuous species as lichens, yet fancied\r\nthat many of the smaller and more obscure species were merely inorganic\r\ndiscolorations. It is certainly very difficult to account for such a\r\nstate of matters at the present day, when so much attention is being\r\npaid to almost every other class of plants. Vainly have I sought either\r\nin the nature of the case itself or in my conversations with botanists,\r\nfor any intelligible solution of such apathy and neglect: though many\r\ngood and sufficient reasons have presented themselves to my mind why\r\nthey should be regarded in a very different light. It cannot with any\r\nshow of propriety be objected that lichens are an uninteresting class\r\nof plants, and consequently undeserving of serious study. So far from\r\nthis, they are in various respects as interesting not only as any other\r\nclass of cryptogamics, but also as many other plants, which occupy a\r\nhigher and more conspicuous place in the scale of vegetation. Being as\r\nit were the pioneers of all other plant life, for which they serve to\r\nprepare the soil on the coral islet and the barren rock,--constituting\r\nthe most generally diffused class of terrestrial plants on the surface\r\nof the globe, from arctic lands to tropical climes,--presenting\r\nessential simplicity of structure, being composed entirely of an\r\naggregation of cells, though at the same time this is amply compensated\r\nfor by endless variety of form,--adorning as they do, with their\r\nvariously coloured thalli and apothecia, the most romantic and the most\r\ndreary situations,--affording in some cases valuable material for the\r\ndyer and the perfumer, nay, even for medicinal purposes,--supplying,\r\nas some of them do, more or less, nutritious food for man and beast,\r\nunder circumstances and in regions where no other can be had,--it is\r\nvery evident that the prevailing neglect of them cannot arise from\r\ntheir being in any way uninteresting, and destitute either of beauty\r\nor utility. Nor does this, as might be inferred, result from any\r\npeculiar difficulty attending their study. There indeed seems to be\r\na notion prevalent, not only amongst the students of phænogamic, but\r\nalso amongst those of cryptogamic plants, that there are, somehow or\r\nother, almost insuperable difficulties connected with the pursuit of\r\nLichenology. Now, it is quite true that the correct study of these\r\nplants is by no means an easy one, and that an accurate knowledge of\r\nthem is not to be obtained in a day or an hour; but the same may,\r\nwith equal truth, be said of any other branch of Phytology, which\r\nrequires minute research and microscopical examination. Here, as\r\nelsewhere, there is no royal road to learning, and the difficulties\r\nwhich lie in the way must be boldly faced. If the student can only\r\nmuster up sufficient courage to cross the threshold and prosecute his\r\ninvestigations with zeal and steady perseverance, he will find in this,\r\nas in other cases, that the difficulties which looked so formidable at\r\na distance, will, one by one, be successfully surmounted.\r\n\r\nBut to whatever cause the paucity of lichenists, both in our own\r\nand other countries, is to be attributed, it certainly does not\r\noriginate in any difficulty connected with their collection and\r\npreservation. In fact, there is no other class of plants, where\r\nthese, and more especially the latter, can be so easily effected, at\r\na little expenditure of time and trouble. A few simple directions\r\nare, therefore, all that are necessary to be given on these points.\r\nAs to the collecting of lichens, it has already been intimated that\r\nthey are almost universally distributed, though of course in this\r\nrespect subject to the same laws as the higher orders of vegetation.\r\nIn our own country we have now a list of about eight hundred species,\r\nconstituting by far the greater proportion of the Lichen Flora of\r\nEurope. In most parts of Great Britain and Ireland, a very fair number\r\nof these may readily be gathered, capable, as they are, of existing\r\nin almost every situation where they can derive requisite nourishment\r\nfrom the atmosphere. On the rocks and boulders of the seashore and\r\nthe mountain-side, on the trunks and branches of trees in woods and\r\nforests, on peaty soil of bare moorlands, and on stone fences in\r\nupland tracts, nay, even on old pales and walls in suburban districts,\r\na goodly harvest may generally be reaped. Few localities indeed there\r\nare, within the area of these islands (London and its environs,\r\nwhere the atmosphere is so impregnated with smoke, being the chief\r\nexception), in which the lichenist will find his occupation gone. True,\r\nit is only in some more favoured tracts, chiefly maritime and montane,\r\nthat he can expect to meet with many of our rarer species; but even in\r\nmost lowland districts, especially such as are well wooded, he may,\r\nwith profit, pursue his researches, and collect various of the more\r\ncommon species. These will just be as useful in making him acquainted\r\nwith the structure and physiology of lichens as though he had gathered\r\nthe rarest that grow on Ben Lawers or by Killarney's lake. The\r\napparatus requisite for collecting is neither complicated nor expensive.\r\n\r\nA tin japanned vasculum, or what is perhaps better still, a black\r\nleather haversack, of larger or smaller dimensions as the case may be,\r\nsuspended over the shoulder by a strap, is of course indispensable\r\nfor holding the specimens gathered. The latter of these we have found\r\nto be more generally convenient, as we can take it with us also for a\r\nshort ramble, without its attracting so much attention from curious\r\nrustics, as the less-known and more singular-looking vasculum. Two\r\nsets of instruments are also necessary for removing the plant from\r\nthe substratum on which it grows, as well as for breaking off in\r\nmany cases a thin portion of the latter along therewith. These are a\r\ngeologist's hammer and chisel for such as grow on rocks, boulders, and\r\nstones; a gardener's pruning-knife for such as grow on trees, pales,\r\nand the ground; as also an ordinary table-knife for detaching, by\r\ninsertion under them, such foliaceous species as can thus be separated\r\nfrom the substratum. To these must be added several sheets of soft\r\nand moderately thick paper, cut into different sizes (some newspapers\r\nsuit remarkably well), in which to wrap up the individual specimens\r\nand prevent them rubbing against each other; a few card-boxes also, of\r\nvarious sizes, in which for greater safety to place any of the more\r\nbrittle species, or fragments of the rarer ones, by themselves; and\r\na pocket-lens of good magnifying power, by which we may be able to\r\ndetect on the spot those minuter species which the naked eye can with\r\ndifficulty distinguish. With these the lichenist is fully equipped for\r\nan excursion, whether \"near at hand or far away,\" and, with waterproof\r\nand umbrella, is ready to take the field even in threatening weather. A\r\ngood deal of discrimination must be used in the selection of specimens\r\nfor removal, which, in all cases where such can be obtained, ought\r\nto be fertile, with both apothecia and spermagones fully developed.\r\nHence, such as are too old or too young, may be passed by, as neither\r\nthe spores nor spermatia, by which alone, in many instances, they can\r\nbe determined, will be found in a normal condition, any more than the\r\nthallus itself. The specimens gathered ought in every case to be of\r\nsufficient size to show distinctly the character of the thallus and of\r\nthe fructification. Where, however, the thallus, as it frequently does,\r\nspreads very extensively over the substratum, it will be sufficient to\r\nbreak off such a portion from the circumference towards the centre, as\r\nwill give an adequate idea of the more important characteristics of\r\nthe plant. This is a point of considerable consequence; for should a\r\nportion be taken off from the circumference alone, or from the centre\r\nalone, it will often be entirely unsuitable for showing the real nature\r\nof the plant, and be quite useless for purposes of description. A\r\nlittle experience, however, will serve to prevent the commission of a\r\nmistake, into which, judging from the number of imperfect specimens\r\nwhich are sent me to be named, beginners are very apt to fall. Practice\r\nwill also in time enable the tyro to use the hammer and chisel in\r\nsuch a way as to obtain neat specimens of saxicole species--a matter\r\nof importance with respect to their subsequent mounting. As to the\r\nbest season for collecting, I need scarcely remind the reader that\r\nlichens are perennial plants, remarkable for their longevity, and that\r\nduring the whole year round they may be found in fruit. The lichenist\r\nhas not to wait for any particular month or months, as other botanists\r\nhave to do, before he can collect the objects of his search in a\r\nfully-developed condition. Spring, summer, autumn, and even winter,\r\nexcept when the snow conceals all vegetation beneath its white mantle,\r\nare all alike to him, and in each he will find every species of lichen\r\nin perfection. At the same time, he will be most successful after a\r\nshower of rain or a slight frost has fallen, inasmuch as, becoming\r\nswollen with the moisture then imbibed, many of the minuter species\r\nwhich might otherwise be overlooked, are more readily perceived, and\r\nthe foliaceous species more easily removed from the substratum to which\r\nthey are more or less closely affixed.\r\n\r\nNothing more need be said on the collecting of lichens, as a short\r\nexperience will be more useful than further details. We proceed,\r\ntherefore, to give a few hints on their subsequent preservation.\r\nThis is a very easy process, presenting no difficulty whatever, and\r\noccupying but little time. We shall suppose that the collector has\r\nreturned from a successful expedition, with his vasculum or haversack\r\nwell filled with specimens from all sorts of habitats. Opening the\r\npapers in which they have been wrapped up, he will take them out one by\r\none, and place them separately upon a table, over which a newspaper has\r\npreviously been spread. If gathered in wet weather, they ought not to\r\nbe left long in the papers, as in this case they are very apt to become\r\ncovered with mould. After allowing them to remain in this position till\r\nthey are thoroughly dry, he may at once proceed with hammer and chisel,\r\nor with knife and scissors, to reduce to a suitable size such of them\r\nas he could not conveniently thus manipulate in the field. When this is\r\ndone, they may then be affixed with gum, of a rather thick consistency,\r\nto slips of white paper, with the locality and date of their collection\r\nwritten beneath. There will be no difficulty felt in thus affixing\r\nsaxicole, corticole, and lignicole species, though where the nature of\r\nthe stone or wood is more absorbent, several applications of the gum\r\nmay be necessary before they properly adhere. With terricole species,\r\nhowever, a somewhat more lengthened process is necessary, owing to\r\nthe brittle nature of the substratum, in consequence of which, if not\r\nproperly preserved, they often crumble into dust in the herbarium. To\r\nprevent this, M. Norman, of Trömsoe, Norway, has recently prescribed a\r\nsolution of isinglass in spirits of wine, which, when liquefied in a\r\nvessel plunged in water of the temperature of 25°-30°C., is greedily\r\nimbibed by the earth, and becomes inspissated into a solid gelatine\r\nat a temperature below 15°. This solution may be applied until the\r\nearth becomes thoroughly saturated, and after it is perfectly dry, the\r\nspecimens will possess sufficient hardness and tenacity, and may then\r\nbe mounted like the others. So far, however, as my own experience goes,\r\nI have found a weak solution of gum-arabic, frequently repeated, and\r\napplied to the under surface and edges of the specimens, to be quite\r\nas efficacious; and if after becoming thoroughly dry, they be first\r\naffixed by a thicker solution to slips of thin tissue-paper, they\r\nwill be equally ready for being mounted as above. Either of these two\r\nmethods may also with advantage be applied to such species as grow\r\nupon decayed mosses. Slight pressure may be applied to the thallus of\r\nfruticulose, filamentose, and foliaceous species, in order that they\r\nmay lie better in the herbarium; but this should be done only to a\r\nvery limited degree, so as not to obliterate the normal appearance of\r\nthe branches or lobes. As the character of the under surface of the\r\nthallus is frequently of great importance, at least in foliaceous\r\nand fruticulose plants, a portion of this, not necessarily detached,\r\nshould be turned over, for facility of inspection, and pressed down on\r\nthe paper, before the specimens have become quite dry and rigid. In\r\norder to destroy any insects that may be upon the plants when gathered,\r\nor by which they may afterwards be infested, lichenists at one time\r\nwere in the habit of poisoning them with corrosive sublimate. Frequent\r\nexposure, however, to the air in dry weather, and the presence of a\r\nlittle camphor, will be quite sufficient to prevent any mischief from\r\nthis source.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 43. Section of _Physcia parietina_.\r\n\r\n_a._ Paraphyses. _b._ Asci with spores. _c._ Hypothecium. _d._ Section\r\nof apothecium. _e._ Spore.]\r\n\r\nBut having thus arranged, though the arrangement is but temporary,\r\nthe specimens gathered, on slips of white paper, the next and most\r\nimportant point is their due examination and determination. This, in\r\nthe present advanced state of Lichenology, is unquestionably, in many\r\ncases, a task of considerable difficulty, and in the short space at\r\nour disposal it would be quite impossible to give anything like an\r\nadequate explanation of the mode in which this is to be effected.\r\nSuffice it at present to say that sections must be made of the\r\nthallus to ascertain the character of its different layers, as also\r\nsections of the apothecia and spermagones to ascertain the nature of\r\nthe spores and spermatia. For both purposes a good microscope, with\r\n1/4-inch object-glass, is absolutely indispensable to the student.\r\nThe examination of the spores, upon which, in so many cases, the\r\ndetermination of the species chiefly depends, should present little\r\nor no difficulty, at least to the fungologist. It may be readily\r\neffected by moistening the apothecium with water, and then, with a\r\ndissecting-knife, making a thin vertical section through its centre.\r\nPutting this on a glass slide, or in a compressorium, in a drop of\r\nhydrate of potash, and then placing it under the microscope, a view\r\nwill be obtained of the asci, spores, paraphyses, hypothecium, &c.,\r\neach of which may afterwards be insulated and examined more minutely\r\nin detail. Take, for example, the well-known beautiful yellow lichen\r\n(_Physcia parietina_), so common everywhere on walls, rocks, and trees,\r\nand treat a very thin section of the mature apothecium as before\r\nmentioned. Under the microscope it will appear as represented in Fig.\r\n43.\r\n\r\nIn the same way the spermagones may be examined, when the nature of\r\nthe sterigmata and spermatia will be apparent. By cutting across the\r\nthallus of the above species, we can perceive even by the naked eye\r\nthat it consists of three different layers, which when microscopically\r\nexamined present the appearance shown in the above figure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 44. Section of _Physcia parietina_.\r\n\r\n_a._ Cortical stratum. _b._ Gonidic stratum. _c._ Medullary stratum.]\r\n\r\nBut in addition to this microscopical examination, it is also requisite\r\nto observe the different chemical reactions produced on the asci or the\r\nhymeneal gelatine with iodine (I), which will tinge these either bluish\r\nor reddish wine-coloured, or else leave them uncoloured. Similarly the\r\nthallus, including both the cortical layer and the medulla, may be\r\ntested with hydrate of potash (K), and hypochlorite of lime (C), the\r\nlatter being applied either by itself or added to K when wet. In some\r\ncases no reaction will be produced by these either upon the cortical\r\nstratum or the medulla; in others they will be tinged yellowish or\r\nreddish. The formulæ for the preparation of these reagents are: for\r\niodine, iodine, gr. j; iodide of potash, gr. iij, distilled water, 1/2\r\noz.; for hydrate of potash, equal weights of caustic potash and water;\r\nfor hydrochlorite of lime, chloride of lime and water of any strength.\r\nAfter correctly ascertaining the specific name of the specimens\r\ncollected, this is to be written on the slips of paper to which they\r\nare affixed, above the locality and date, and the best of them,\r\nincluding all varieties and forms, selected for subsequent mounting\r\nin the herbarium. This may be effected either in the same way as the\r\nmounting of phanerogamic plants, or by affixing the specimens to pieces\r\nof millboard covered with white paper, and arranging them according to\r\nthe order of the genera and species in the system of classification\r\nwhich may be adopted. For facility of reference the latter is\r\nundoubtedly the preferable method; and if the cards are disposed in a\r\ncabinet with shallow drawers, they will not, so far at least as our\r\nBritish species are concerned, be found to occupy too much space.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV.\r\n\r\nSEAWEEDS.\r\n\r\nBy W. H. Grattann.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn some articles published in 'Science-Gossip' a few years ago, I\r\ngave some directions for collecting and preserving Marine Algæ, or\r\nseaweeds, and although, I think, it will be difficult to simplify those\r\ndirections, or even to add much that would be really serviceable to\r\nyoung beginners in this delightful pursuit, it is my intention, in\r\ngoing over the ground once more, to be as explicit as I possibly can;\r\nand here, on the threshold of the subject, I have a few words to say\r\nto one or two occasional contributors to that journal, who, in calling\r\nattention to the beauty of marine vegetation, and urging young persons\r\nto collect and preserve Algæ, have advised them to ignore books on\r\nthe subject, and go to the shore, use their own eyes, and collect for\r\nthemselves, &c. I am sorry very greatly to differ from such advice.\r\nCollecting in this way may be amusing enough to those who care not for\r\nscience, but when it leads to parcels of seaweeds, picked up at random,\r\nbeing sent to botanists with a request that the names of such plants\r\nshould be sent to the writer, it is the reverse of pleasure to the\r\nscientific botanist, for it gives him infinite trouble, and enables\r\nhim to convey but very imperfect information to his applicant. The\r\neditor of that journal has often been thus appealed to, and packages\r\nof decayed rubbish have frequently been sent to me for examination,\r\ncontaining species or rather fragments of plants, which, for the most\r\npart, were utterly worthless and defied identification.\r\n\r\nAlmost all collectors commence by mounting plants which a little\r\nexperience proves to be really what the old poet termed \"_alga projecta\r\nvilior_\"; but as seaweed-gathering, like everything else, requires\r\npractice, beginners must not be disappointed because they do not find\r\nrarities or fine specimens whenever and wherever they may seek for them.\r\n\r\nWhen I think of the difficulties I experienced at the outset of my\r\nstudy of marine botany, especially in the collecting and drying of\r\nseaweeds, I feel strongly inclined to urge all beginners to obtain\r\nsome information concerning Marine Algæ before they go to the shore to\r\ncollect for themselves. A very few hours of study with an experienced\r\nalgologist, or even a perusal of some illustrated work on British algæ,\r\nwill save much trouble and materially assist the unpractised eye in\r\nselecting specimens for the herbarium. I may here mention as highly\r\nuseful to incipient algologists Dr. Landsborough's 'British Seaweeds'\r\nand Professor Harvey's 'Manual,' either of which may be obtained for a\r\nfew shillings; but if my readers are resident in London, I advise them\r\nto pay a few visits to the Library of the British Museum, and there\r\ninspect Dr. Harvey's 'Phycologia Britannica.' In this magnificent work\r\nthey will find coloured figures of nearly every British seaweed, with\r\ndrawings from magnified portions, and various structural details of the\r\nhighest value to students; and I once more impress on all collectors\r\nthe importance of some degree of book-learning ere they sally forth,\r\nbag or vasculum in hand, to cull the lovely \"flowers of the ocean,\" or\r\ngather what best may please them from the rejectamenta on the shore.\r\n\r\nIf the collector wishes to learn, not merely the _names_ of plants,\r\nbut to distinguish _species_, he will do well to provide himself with\r\na copy of Harvey's little volume the 'Synopsis of British Seaweeds,'\r\nand a Stanhope or Coddington lens, by means of which he can examine\r\nportions of delicate plants as he finds them, and compare them with\r\nthe descriptions given in the 'Synopsis'; in this way, if he have any\r\nsuccess during his excursions, he will quickly become familiar with\r\nmost of the plants which are cast ashore or grow within tide-marks.\r\n\r\nTime will not admit of, neither is space at present available for, a\r\nsingle line beyond what may be practically serviceable to my youthful\r\nreaders; therefore I will hasten to describe the course of action in\r\nseaweed-collecting as I have practised it for many years. At once,\r\nthen, to the shore, but not to the sandy shore, for only useless\r\ndecayed rubbish, or here and there some straggling plants of _Zostera\r\nmarina_, or grass-wrack, will be met with there. The collector must\r\naway to the rocks, and search carefully every pool he meets with, from\r\na little distance below high-water mark, and so on down to the water's\r\nedge, always remembering that it is better to collect while the tide is\r\nreceding than as it is coming in.\r\n\r\nPresuming that few persons will think of collecting seaweeds much\r\nearlier than the month of May, let me observe that most of the\r\naccessible species of olive and green plants which grow on rocky shores\r\nand in tide-pools, will be found from May to June in pretty fair\r\ncondition, but very few red plants, except those which grow on the\r\nshady sides of rock-pools, or under the shelter of the larger olive\r\nweeds, will be met with until a considerable space is laid bare by the\r\nreceding water at the low spring tides, about a day or two before and\r\nafter the full moon.\r\n\r\nAs nearly all the _rare_ red weeds grow in deep water, they are seldom\r\ntaken in any degree of perfection unless they are dredged; but in the\r\nsummer months, say from June to the end of August, many fine plants are\r\noccasionally thrown up from deep water, and others are found growing\r\non the stems of the great oar-weeds, portions of which are cast ashore,\r\nbeautifully fringed with one or more species of Delesseria and other\r\nrare Rhodosperms--in fact, during the rising tide, diligent collectors\r\nmay secure many a lovely deep-water plant as it comes floating in, but\r\nwhich, if allowed to remain long exposed to the action of sunlight,\r\nwill fade in colour and decompose before it can be mounted. This is\r\nespecially the case with all the soft gelatinous red plants, such as\r\nthe Callithamnia, and all the Gloiocladiæ, as well as a few of the\r\nsofter olive weeds; and here I may observe that there is one genus of\r\nbeautiful olive plants, the _Sporochnaceæ_, which must on no account be\r\nput into the vasculum with any of the delicate red plants, for they not\r\nonly very rapidly decompose, but injure almost all others with which\r\nthey are placed in contact. The species are not numerous, and they may\r\nbe easily recognized, after having been previously studied from the\r\ncoloured figures either in Harvey's 'Phycologia,' or in Bradbury and\r\nEvans's 'Nature-printed Seaweeds.' It is also a curious fact respecting\r\nthis genus, that while they are all of a beautiful olive tint in the\r\ngrowing state, they invariably change to a fine verdigris-green in\r\ndrying; and indeed this is very generally the case with the filamentous\r\nolive weeds, the Fuci, or common rock-weeds, as constantly turning\r\nquite black after mounting: whence the term, that of \"Melanosperm,\"\r\nwhich is given to the subdivision to which all the olive weeds belong.\r\n\r\nAs there are so few seaweeds which have generally known common names,\r\nI shall make no apology for using the names by which they are known\r\nto science, presuming that all intending collectors will, as I have\r\nalready suggested, gain _some_ knowledge of Terminology ere they go out\r\n\"seaweeding.\"\r\n\r\nBeginners should be cautioned against the very natural error of\r\nbringing home too many plants at a time; they must be moderate in\r\ntheir gatherings, or be content to risk the loss of some choice\r\nspecimens, which will decompose unless they are attended to before\r\nnight. The first thing to be done upon arriving at home, is to empty\r\nthe collecting-bag into a white basin of sea-water, and to select\r\nthe best and cleanest plants as soon as possible, giving each a good\r\nswill before placing it in another vessel of clean water, and getting\r\nrid of rejected plants at once, so that the basin first used will be\r\navailable for rewashing the weeds before they are severally placed in\r\nthe mounting dish. When a day is fixed on for seaweeding, the collector\r\nshould order a large bucket of clean sea-water, which, after being left\r\nto settle, should be strained through a towel, so as to be as free as\r\npossible from sand and dirt. Two or three large pie-dishes will be\r\nnecessary, the deeper the better, and white, if such can be obtained.\r\nPlace these on a separate table with towels under them, and reserve\r\na table specially for the mounting dish and the parcels of papers,\r\ncalicoes, and blotting-papers. The large white bath used in photography\r\nis very well adapted for mounting seaweeds; the lip at one corner is\r\nconvenient for pouring off soiled water, and its form--that of an\r\noblong--is most suitable for receiving the papers on which the plants\r\nare to be mounted. Beside this vessel should be placed the following\r\nimplements--a porcupine quill, two camel-hair pencils (one small, the\r\nother large and flat), a pair of strong brass forceps, a penknife, a\r\npair of scissors, a small sponge, an ivory paper-knife, and two thin\r\nplates of perforated zinc somewhat less in length and breadth than the\r\ninside of the mounting dish.\r\n\r\nSmooth drawing paper, or fine white cartridge paper, is generally\r\nemployed for mounting. The operator should be provided with three\r\ndifferent sizes of paper, and these should have each a piece of very\r\nfine calico and four pieces of blotting-paper to correspond. The\r\nprocess of mounting one of the filamentous or branching species is as\r\nfollows:--The specimen being cleaned and placed in the mounting dish, a\r\npiece of paper of suitable size is laid on one of the perforated zinc\r\nplates, and both are then slipped quickly under the floating weed.\r\nThe root or base of the specimen is then pressed down on the paper\r\nwith a finger of the left hand, while the right hand is employing\r\nthe forceps or porcupine quill in arranging the plant in as natural\r\na position as possible, ere the zinc plate is gently and gradually\r\nraised at the top or bottom, as may be necessary, to ensure a perfect\r\ndisplay of every portion of the plant; but if, upon drawing it out of\r\nthe water, it should present an unsightly appearance from too thick an\r\noverlapping of the branches, the whole must be reimmersed, and a little\r\npruning of superfluous portions may be employed with advantage to the\r\nspecimen and satisfaction to the operator. Care should be taken that\r\nthe water be drained off the paper as completely as possible before\r\nthe calico is laid over the plant, and this is accomplished by raising\r\nthe paper containing the plant as it still lies on the zinc plate, and\r\ntransferring it to a thin board placed in an inclined position against\r\none of the basins, and with the large camel-hair pencil _paint_ off\r\nthe water as it runs away from the specimen, and absorb what remains,\r\nwhen the paper is laid flat, with the sponge. Delicate species may be\r\nleft to drain for a few minutes, while the operator is arranging other\r\nspecimens. When the water is sufficiently drained off, the paper is\r\nthen laid on the blotter, and the piece of calico is placed upon the\r\nplant--a sheet of blotter being laid upon the calico.\r\n\r\nCare should be observed in subjecting plants to pressure, which, in the\r\nfirst instance, should be sufficient only to help the absorption of\r\nwater. The first set of blotting-papers should be changed in half an\r\nhour after the whole batch of specimens have been placed in the press,\r\nand these must be thoroughly dried before they are used again. After\r\nthe second or third change of blotters, the plants should remain under\r\nstrong pressure for two or three days; but the pieces of calico must\r\nnot be removed until it is pretty certain that the papers and plants\r\nare quite dry.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the Fuci or common rock-weeds, I never place\r\nseaweeds in _fresh_ water: with these, especially _Fucus serratus_,\r\n_F. nodosus_, _F. vesiculosus_, and _F. canaliculatus_, a few hours'\r\nimmersion in fresh water is an advantage, as it soaks the salt out of\r\ntheir fronds and renders them more pliable. As all the Fuci turn black\r\nin drying, and few of them adhere well to paper, I arrange my specimens\r\nin single layers between the folds of a clean dry towel, and keep them\r\nunder pressure until they are quite dry; they may then be put away\r\nloosely, or gummed on sheets of paper.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing directions for mounting filamentous seaweeds are\r\napplicable to all the branching species of Olive, Red, and Green\r\nplants; but in each of the three subdivisions there are a few species\r\nwhich are so gelatinous--in fact, so soft and spongy, that they\r\nrequire the utmost care during pressure, otherwise they adhere to the\r\ncalico and break off in fragments as it is drawn away. Such plants\r\nmust be left to dry in a horizontal position for an hour or so before\r\nthe calico and blotters are placed over them, and pressure must be\r\nvery slight until they have adhered closely to the paper. Among the\r\nChlorosperms, or green plants, there are the various species of Codium,\r\nyoung plants of which only are manageable or indeed desirable. In\r\nthe Melanosperms, some species of the genus _Mesogloia_ will require\r\ncare and patience in mounting, as well as the long string-like\r\nplant, known as _Chorda filum_; and again, the spreading tuberous\r\nmass called _Leathsia tuberiformis_, portions of which should be cut\r\nfrom the rock, the sand scraped and washed out, then laid on the wet\r\npaper, and allowed to shrink for some hours ere calico blotters and\r\npressure be applied. These difficulties are much more numerous among\r\nthe Rhodosperms, or red seaweeds, experience only teaching the best\r\nmethod of treatment. I will, however, mention the names of some very\r\ntroublesome plants, the fronds of which, if subjected to pressure too\r\nsoon, burst and discharge their carmine contents; not only presenting\r\nan unsightly appearance, but destroying the specimen. These are\r\n_Griffithsia corallina_, _Dudresnaia coccinea_, _Naccaria Wigghii_, all\r\nthe _Chylocladia_, and the rare _Gloiosiphonia_, as well as the slimy\r\nworm-like plant known as _Nemalion multifidum_.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these troubles among the red plants, there is an\r\nopposite difficulty connected with several Rhodosperms which must be\r\npointed out; and that is owing to an absence or scarcity of gelatine\r\nin their substance, which is in some of a stout, leathery, or horny\r\nnature, and in others is due to a coating of carbonate of lime, which\r\ncompletely envelops the vegetable structure. Among the former may be\r\nmentioned the several species of Phyllophora, and several among the\r\ngenera Gigartina, Chondrus, and Sphærococcus; and in the latter, all\r\nthe calcareous Algæ, especially the well-known _Corallina officinalis_\r\nand _Jania rubens_. All these, and several others of a membraneous\r\nnature, among the olive as well as the red weeds, must be first mounted\r\nin the ordinary manner, and when they are tolerably dry and begin to\r\nshrink away from the paper, fill the mounting-dish with stale skimmed\r\nmilk; refloat the plants on their papers in the milk, and indeed go\r\nthrough the same process as before with the sea-water, but be careful\r\nto absorb all the milk from off the surface of the plants and the back\r\nof the papers, and then, after the usual time for drying and pressing,\r\nthe most obstinate seaweed will be found adhering perfectly to the\r\npaper, and will remain so permanently.\r\n\r\nOne more difficulty must be referred to for the benefit of young\r\nbeginners, who, in mounting some of the Laminaria and that peculiar\r\nolive weed called _Himanthalia lorea_, may wish to preserve the\r\nthick-branching roots and stems. First wash the roots as clean as\r\npossible, and then, with a sharp penknife, make a clean cutting\r\nhorizontally of the whole root and some little distance up the thick\r\nround stem; then, after having removed the cut portions, place the\r\ninner surface of the root and stem on the paper, and the gelatinous\r\nmatter which oozes from the plant will cause the roots to adhere firmly\r\nto the paper, and in drying, the usual olive tint of the various\r\nspecies of Laminaria will be finely preserved. Some botanists employ\r\na mixture made of isinglass, dissolved in alcohol, to fix some of the\r\nhorny or robust species on paper; but if gum be made use of, it is\r\nbetter to employ gum tragacanth than gum-arabic, because, in drying,\r\nthe former has none of that objectionable glare which is peculiar to\r\ngum arabic.\r\n\r\nAs regards the best method of pressing seaweeds, I think I can hardly\r\ndo better than refer my readers to the figure of a Seaweed Press\r\n(Fig. 45), which I invented for myself many years ago, in which I\r\nhave pressed many thousands of beautiful seaweeds. Almost any degree\r\nof pressure can be obtained in it: first, by the thumb-screws on the\r\niron rods at each corner, and, finally, by means of the clamp which\r\nis strapped on the top of the press. Any intelligent cabinet-maker or\r\nironmonger could provide such a press from an inspection of the figure;\r\nthe cost, of course, varying with the dimensions and the number of\r\nboards.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 45. Seaweed Press.]\r\n\r\nWith respect to localities favourable to seaweed-gathering, I may\r\nspecially mention the south coast of Devon; from Exmouth, where\r\n_Bryopsis_ and _Padina pavonia_ grow in perfection, to Torquay and the\r\ncoves of Torbay, and down the coast to Plymouth, Cawsand Bay, and\r\nfinally Whitsand Bay, the \"happy hunting-grounds\" of the enthusiastic\r\nalgologist. On the north-east coast, Filey and Whitby must be\r\nmentioned, as well as the shores upwards from Tynemouth to Whitley.\r\nPeterhead is also a good locality, the rare _Ectocarpus Mertensii_,\r\n_Odonthalia dentata_, and _Callithamnion floccosum_ being found there\r\nin abundance. Other favourable stations in Scotland, well known to\r\nme, are Lamlash Bay and Whiting Bay; nor must the Isle of Wight be\r\nforgotten, for in the rock-pools, at Shanklin especially, the most\r\nmagnificent form of _Padina pavonia_ may be found growing during the\r\nsummer months in the utmost profusion.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I beg leave to inform my readers that I have recently\r\npublished a volume on British Marine Algæ, in which every species that\r\nis likely to be met with by ordinary collectors is described, and every\r\nBritish seaweed that is capable of illustration in a work intended for\r\npopular information, is figured from plants in my own possession, and,\r\nin addition, diagrams and figures from drawings of magnified portions,\r\nillustrative of structure and fructification, appear throughout the\r\npages of my work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\nA\r\n\r\n                                    PAGE\r\n\r\n  Adventures of fungus
