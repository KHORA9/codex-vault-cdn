T. Pritchett\r\nof places visited and objects described.\r\n\r\nLONDON\r\nJOHN MURRAY, ALBEMARLE STREET\r\n1913.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO\r\nCHARLES LYELL, ESQ., F.R.S.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis second edition is dedicated with grateful pleasure, as an\r\nacknowledgment that the chief part of whatever scientific merit this\r\njournal and the other works of the author may possess, has been derived\r\nfrom studying the well-known and admirable\r\n\r\nPRINCIPLES OF GEOLOGY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFATORY NOTICE TO THE ILLUSTRATED EDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis work was described, on its first appearance, by a writer in the\r\n_Quarterly Review_ as “One of the most interesting narratives of\r\nvoyaging that it has fallen to our lot to take up, and one which must\r\nalways occupy a distinguished place in the history of scientific\r\nnavigation.”\r\n\r\nThis prophecy has been amply verified by experience; the extraordinary\r\nminuteness and accuracy of Mr. Darwin’s observations, combined with the\r\ncharm and simplicity of his descriptions, have ensured the popularity\r\nof this book with all classes of readers—and that popularity has even\r\nincreased in recent years. No attempt, however, has hitherto been made\r\nto produce an illustrated edition of this valuable work: numberless\r\nplaces and objects are mentioned and described, but the difficulty of\r\nobtaining authentic and original representations of them drawn for the\r\npurpose has never been overcome until now.\r\n\r\nMost of the views given in this work are from sketches made on the spot\r\nby Mr. Pritchett, with Mr. Darwin’s book by his side. Some few of the\r\nothers are taken from engravings which Mr. Darwin had himself selected\r\nfor their interest as illustrating his voyage, and which have been\r\nkindly lent by his son.\r\n\r\nMr. Pritchett’s name is well known in connection with the voyages of\r\nthe _Sunbeam_ and _Wanderer_, and it is believed that the\r\nillustrations, which have been chosen and verified with the utmost care\r\nand pains, will greatly add to the value and interest of the “VOYAGE OF\r\nA NATURALIST.”\r\n\r\nJOHN MURRAY.\r\n\r\n_December_ 1889.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTHOR’S PREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have stated in the preface to the first Edition of this work, and in\r\nthe _Zoology of the Voyage of the Beagle_, that it was in consequence\r\nof a wish expressed by Captain Fitz Roy, of having some scientific\r\nperson on board, accompanied by an offer from him of giving up part of\r\nhis own accommodations, that I volunteered my services, which received,\r\nthrough the kindness of the hydrographer, Captain Beaufort, the\r\nsanction of the Lords of the Admiralty. As I feel that the\r\nopportunities which I enjoyed of studying the Natural History of the\r\ndifferent countries we visited have been wholly due to Captain Fitz\r\nRoy, I hope I may here be permitted to repeat my expression of\r\ngratitude to him; and to add that, during the five years we were\r\ntogether, I received from him the most cordial friendship and steady\r\nassistance. Both to Captain Fitz Roy and to all the Officers of the\r\n_Beagle_[1] I shall ever feel most thankful for the undeviating\r\nkindness with which I was treated during our long voyage.\r\n\r\n [1] I must take this opportunity of returning my sincere thanks to Mr.\r\n Bynoe, the surgeon of the _Beagle_, for his very kind attention to me\r\n when I was ill at Valparaiso.\r\n\r\nThis volume contains, in the form of a Journal, a history of our\r\nvoyage, and a sketch of those observations in Natural History and\r\nGeology, which I think will possess some interest for the general\r\nreader. I have in this edition largely condensed and corrected some\r\nparts, and have added a little to others, in order to render the volume\r\nmore fitted for popular reading; but I trust that naturalists will\r\nremember that they must refer for details to the larger publications\r\nwhich comprise the scientific results of the Expedition. The _Zoology\r\nof the Voyage of the Beagle_ includes an account of the Fossil\r\nMammalia, by Professor Owen; of the Living Mammalia, by Mr. Waterhouse;\r\nof the Birds, by Mr. Gould; of the Fish, by the Reverend L. Jenyns; and\r\nof the Reptiles, by Mr. Bell. I have appended to the descriptions of\r\neach species an account of its habits and range. These works, which I\r\nowe to the high talents and disinterested zeal of the above\r\ndistinguished authors, could not have been undertaken had it not been\r\nfor the liberality of the Lords Commissioners of Her Majesty’s\r\nTreasury, who, through the representation of the Right Honourable the\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer, have been pleased to grant a sum of one\r\nthousand pounds towards defraying part of the expenses of publication.\r\n\r\nI have myself published separate volumes on the _Structure and\r\nDistribution of Coral Reefs_; on the _ Volcanic Islands visited during\r\nthe Voyage of the Beagle_; and on the _Geology of South America._ The\r\nsixth volume of the _ Geological Transactions_ contains two papers of\r\nmine on the Erratic Boulders and Volcanic Phenomena of South America.\r\nMessrs. Waterhouse, Walker, Newman, and White, have published several\r\nable papers on the Insects which were collected, and I trust that many\r\nothers will hereafter follow. The plants from the southern parts of\r\nAmerica will be given by Dr. J. Hooker, in his great work on the Botany\r\nof the Southern Hemisphere. The Flora of the Galapagos Archipelago is\r\nthe subject of a separate memoir by him, in the _ Linnean\r\nTransactions._ The Reverend Professor Henslow has published a list of\r\nthe plants collected by me at the Keeling Islands; and the Reverend J.\r\nM. Berkeley has described my cryptogamic plants.\r\n\r\nI shall have the pleasure of acknowledging the great assistance which I\r\nhave received from several other naturalists in the course of this and\r\nmy other works; but I must be here allowed to return my most sincere\r\nthanks to the Reverend Professor Henslow, who, when I was an\r\nundergraduate at Cambridge, was one chief means of giving me a taste\r\nfor Natural History,—who, during my absence, took charge of the\r\ncollections I sent home, and by his correspondence directed my\r\nendeavours,—and who, since my return, has constantly rendered me every\r\nassistance which the kindest friend could offer.\r\n\r\nDOWN, BROMLEY, KENT,\r\n_June_ 1845.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nPorto Praya — Ribeira Grande — Atmospheric Dust with Infusoria — Habits\r\nof a Sea-slug and Cuttle-fish — St. Paul’s Rocks, non-volcanic —\r\nSingular Incrustations — Insects the first Colonists of Islands —\r\nFernando Noronha — Bahia — Burnished Rocks — Habits of a Diodon —\r\nPelagic Confervæ and Infusoria — Causes of discoloured Sea.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nRio de Janeiro — Excursion north of Cape Frio — Great Evaporation —\r\nSlavery — Botofogo Bay — Terrestrial Planariæ — Clouds on the\r\nCorcovado — Heavy Rain — Musical Frogs — Phosphorescent insects —\r\nElater, springing powers of — Blue Haze — Noise made by a Butterfly —\r\nEntomology — Ants — Wasp killing a Spider — Parasitical Spider —\r\nArtifices of an Epeira — Gregarious Spider — Spider with an\r\nunsymmetrical web.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nMonte Video — Maldonado — Excursion to R.

JAGO—CAPE DE VERD ISLANDS\r\n\r\nAfter having been twice driven back by heavy south-western gales, Her\r\nMajesty’s ship _Beagle_, a ten-gun brig, under the command of Captain\r\nFitz Roy, R.N., sailed from Devonport on the 27th of December, 1831.\r\nThe object of the expedition was to complete the survey of Patagonia\r\nand Tierra del Fuego, commenced under Captain King in 1826 to 1830—to\r\nsurvey the shores of Chile, Peru, and of some islands in the\r\nPacific—and to carry a chain of chronometrical measurements round the\r\nWorld. On the 6th of January we reached Teneriffe, but were prevented\r\nlanding, by fears of our bringing the cholera: the next morning we saw\r\nthe sun rise behind the rugged outline of the Grand Canary Island, and\r\nsuddenly illumine the Peak of\r\nTeneriffe, whilst the lower parts were veiled in fleecy clouds. This\r\nwas the first of many delightful days never to be forgotten. On the\r\n16th of January 1832 we anchored at Porto Praya, in St. Jago, the chief\r\nisland of the Cape de Verd archipelago.\r\n\r\nThe neighbourhood of Porto Praya, viewed from the sea, wears a desolate\r\naspect. The volcanic fires of a past age, and the scorching heat of a\r\ntropical sun, have in most places rendered the soil unfit for\r\nvegetation. The country rises in successive steps of table-land,\r\ninterspersed with some truncate conical hills, and the horizon is\r\nbounded by an irregular chain of more lofty mountains. The scene, as\r\nbeheld through the hazy atmosphere of this climate, is one of great\r\ninterest; if, indeed, a person, fresh from sea, and who has just\r\nwalked, for the first time, in a grove of cocoa-nut trees, can be a\r\njudge of anything but his own happiness. The island would generally be\r\nconsidered as very uninteresting, but to any one accustomed only to an\r\nEnglish landscape, the novel aspect of an utterly sterile land\r\npossesses a grandeur which more vegetation might spoil. A single green\r\nleaf can scarcely be discovered over wide tracts of the lava plains;\r\nyet flocks of goats, together with a few cows, contrive to exist. It\r\nrains very seldom, but during a short portion of the year heavy\r\ntorrents fall, and immediately afterwards a light vegetation springs\r\nout of every crevice. This soon withers; and upon such naturally formed\r\nhay the animals live. It had not now rained for an entire year. When\r\nthe island was discovered, the immediate neighbourhood of Porto Praya\r\nwas clothed with trees,[1] the reckless destruction of which has caused\r\nhere, as at St. Helena, and at some of the Canary islands, almost\r\nentire sterility. The broad, flat-bottomed valleys, many of which serve\r\nduring a few days only in the season as watercourses, are clothed with\r\nthickets of leafless bushes. Few living creatures inhabit these\r\nvalleys. The commonest bird is a kingfisher (Dacelo Iagoensis), which\r\ntamely sits on the branches of the castor-oil plant, and thence darts\r\non grasshoppers and lizards. It is brightly coloured, but not so\r\nbeautiful as the European species: in its flight, manners, and place of\r\nhabitation, which is generally in the driest valley, there is also a\r\nwide difference.\r\n\r\n [1] I state this on the authority of Dr. E. Dieffenbach, in his German\r\n translation of the first edition of this Journal.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne day, two of the officers and myself rode to Ribeira Grande, a\r\nvillage a few miles eastward of Porto Praya. Until we reached the\r\nvalley of St. Martin, the country presented its usual dull brown\r\nappearance; but here, a very small rill of water produces a most\r\nrefreshing margin of luxuriant vegetation. In the course of an hour we\r\narrived at Ribeira Grande, and were surprised at the sight of a large\r\nruined fort and cathedral. This little town, before its harbour was\r\nfilled up, was the principal place in the island: it now presents a\r\nmelancholy, but very picturesque appearance. Having procured a black\r\nPadre for a guide, and a Spaniard who had served in the Peninsular war\r\nas an interpreter, we visited a collection of buildings, of which an\r\nancient church formed the principal part. It is here the governors and\r\ncaptain-generals of the islands have been buried. Some of the\r\ntombstones recorded dates of the sixteenth century.[2] The heraldic\r\nornaments were the only things in this retired place that reminded us\r\nof Europe. The church or chapel formed one side of a quadrangle, in the\r\nmiddle of which a large clump of bananas were growing. On another side\r\nwas a hospital, containing about a dozen miserable-looking inmates.\r\n\r\n [2] The Cape de Verd Islands were discovered in 1449. There was a\r\n tombstone of a bishop with the date of 1571; and a crest of a hand and\r\n dagger, dated 1497.\r\n\r\nWe returned to the Vênda to eat our dinners. A considerable number of\r\nmen, women, and children, all as black as jet, collected to watch us.\r\nOur companions were extremely merry; and everything we said or did was\r\nfollowed by their hearty laughter. Before leaving the town we visited\r\nthe cathedral. It does not appear so rich as the smaller church, but\r\nboasts of a little organ, which sent forth singularly inharmonious\r\ncries. We presented the black priest with a few shillings, and the\r\nSpaniard, patting him on the head, said, with much candour, he thought\r\nhis colour made no great difference. We then returned, as fast as the\r\nponies would go, to Porto Praya.\r\n\r\nAnother day we rode to the village of St. Domingo, situated near the\r\ncentre of the island. On a small plain which we crossed, a few stunted\r\nacacias were growing; their tops had been bent by the steady\r\ntrade-wind, in a singular manner—some of them even at right angles to\r\ntheir trunks. The direction\r\nof the branches was exactly north-east by north, and south-west by\r\nsouth, and these natural vanes must indicate the prevailing direction\r\nof the force of the trade-wind. The travelling had made so little\r\nimpression on the barren soil, that we here missed our track, and took\r\nthat to Fuentes. This we did not find out till we arrived there; and we\r\nwere afterwards glad of our mistake. Fuentes is a pretty village, with\r\na small stream; and everything appeared to prosper well, excepting,\r\nindeed, that which ought to do so most—its inhabitants. The black\r\nchildren, completely naked, and looking very wretched, were carrying\r\nbundles of firewood half as big as their own bodies.\r\n\r\nNear Fuentes we saw a large flock of guinea-fowl—probably fifty or\r\nsixty in number. They were extremely wary, and could not be approached.\r\nThey avoided us, like partridges on a rainy day in September, running\r\nwith their heads cocked up; and if pursued, they readily took to the\r\nwing.\r\n\r\nThe scenery of St. Domingo possesses a beauty totally unexpected, from\r\nthe prevalent gloomy character of the rest of the island. The village\r\nis situated at the bottom of a valley, bounded by lofty and jagged\r\nwalls of stratified lava. The black rocks afford a most striking\r\ncontrast with the bright green vegetation, which follows the banks of a\r\nlittle stream of clear water. It happened to be a grand feast-day, and\r\nthe village was full of people. On our return we overtook a party of\r\nabout twenty young black girls, dressed in excellent taste; their black\r\nskins and snow-white linen being set off by coloured turbans and large\r\nshawls. As soon as we approached near, they suddenly all turned round,\r\nand covering the path with their shawls, sung with great energy a wild\r\nsong, beating time with their hands upon their legs. We threw them some\r\nvintéms, which were received with screams of laughter, and we left them\r\nredoubling the noise of their song.\r\n\r\nOne morning the view was singularly clear; the distant mountains being\r\nprojected with the sharpest outline, on a heavy bank of dark blue\r\nclouds. Judging from the appearance, and from similar cases in England,\r\nI supposed that the air was saturated with moisture. The fact, however,\r\nturned out quite the contrary. The hygrometer gave a difference of 29.6\r\ndegrees, between the temperature of the air, and the point at which dew\r\nwas precipitated. This difference was nearly double\r\nthat which I had observed on the previous mornings. This unusual degree\r\nof atmospheric dryness was accompanied by continual flashes of\r\nlightning. Is it not an uncommon case, thus to find a remarkable degree\r\nof aerial transparency with such a state of weather?\r\n\r\nGenerally the atmosphere is hazy; and this is caused by the falling of\r\nimpalpably fine dust, which was found to have slightly injured the\r\nastronomical instruments. The morning before we anchored at Porto\r\nPraya, I collected a little packet of this brown-coloured fine dust,\r\nwhich appeared to have been filtered from the wind by the gauze of the\r\nvane at the masthead. Mr. Lyell has also given me four packets of dust\r\nwhich fell on a vessel a few hundred miles northward of these islands.\r\nProfessor Ehrenberg[3] finds that this dust consists in great part of\r\ninfusoria with siliceous shields, and of the siliceous tissue of\r\nplants. In five little packets which I sent him, he has ascertained no\r\nless than sixty-seven different organic forms! The infusoria, with the\r\nexception of two marine species, are all inhabitants of fresh-water. I\r\nhave found no less than fifteen different accounts of dust having\r\nfallen on vessels when far out in the Atlantic. From the direction of\r\nthe wind whenever it has fallen, and from its having always fallen\r\nduring those months when the harmattan is known to raise clouds of dust\r\nhigh into the atmosphere, we may feel sure that it all comes from\r\nAfrica. It is, however, a very singular fact, that, although Professor\r\nEhrenberg knows many species of infusoria peculiar to Africa, he finds\r\nnone of these in the dust which I sent him. On the other hand, he finds\r\nin it two species which hitherto he knows as living only in South\r\nAmerica. The dust falls in such quantities as to dirty everything on\r\nboard, and to hurt people’s eyes; vessels even have run on shore owing\r\nto the obscurity of the atmosphere. It has often fallen on ships when\r\nseveral hundred, and even more than a thousand miles from the coast of\r\nAfrica, and at points sixteen hundred miles distant in a north and\r\nsouth direction. In some dust which was collected on a vessel three\r\nhundred miles from the land, I was much surprised to find particles of\r\nstone above the thousandth of an inch square,\r\nmixed with finer matter. After this fact one need not be surprised at\r\nthe diffusion of the far lighter and smaller sporules of cryptogamic\r\nplants.\r\n\r\n [3] I must take this opportunity of acknowledging the great kindness\r\n with which this illustrious naturalist has examined many of my\r\n specimens. I have sent (June 1845) a full account of the falling of\r\n this dust to the Geological Society.\r\n\r\nThe geology of this island is the most interesting part of its natural\r\nhistory. On entering the harbour, a perfectly horizontal white band in\r\nthe face of the sea cliff, may be seen running for some miles along the\r\ncoast, and at the height of about forty-five feet above the water. Upon\r\nexamination, this white stratum is found to consist of calcareous\r\nmatter, with numerous shells embedded, most or all of which now exist\r\non the neighbouring coast. It rests on ancient volcanic rocks, and has\r\nbeen covered by a stream of basalt, which must have entered the sea\r\nwhen the white shelly bed was lying at the bottom. It is interesting to\r\ntrace the changes, produced by the heat of the overlying lava, on the\r\nfriable mass, which in parts has been converted into a crystalline\r\nlimestone, and in other parts into a compact spotted stone. Where the\r\nlime has been caught up by the scoriaceous fragments of the lower\r\nsurface of the stream, it is converted into groups of beautifully\r\nradiated fibres resembling arragonite. The beds of lava rise in\r\nsuccessive gently-sloping plains, towards the interior, whence the\r\ndeluges of melted stone have originally proceeded. Within historical\r\ntimes no signs of volcanic activity have, I believe, been manifested in\r\nany part of St. Jago. Even the form of a crater can but rarely be\r\ndiscovered on the summits of the many red cindery hills; yet the more\r\nrecent streams can be distinguished on the coast, forming lines of\r\ncliffs of less height, but stretching out in advance of those belonging\r\nto an older series: the height of the cliffs thus affording a rude\r\nmeasure of the age of the streams.\r\n\r\nDuring our stay, I observed the habits of some marine animals. A large\r\nAplysia is very common. This sea-slug is about five inches long; and is\r\nof a dirty yellowish colour, veined with purple. On each side of the\r\nlower surface, or foot, there is a broad membrane, which appears\r\nsometimes to act as a ventilator, in causing a current of water to flow\r\nover the dorsal branchiæ or lungs. It feeds on the delicate seaweeds\r\nwhich grow among the stones in muddy and shallow water; and I found in\r\nits stomach several small pebbles, as in the gizzard of a bird. This\r\nslug, when disturbed, emits a very fine\r\npurplish-red fluid, which stains the water for the space of a foot\r\naround. Besides this means of defence, an acrid secretion, which is\r\nspread over its body, causes a sharp, stinging sensation, similar to\r\nthat produced by the Physalia, or Portuguese man-of-war.\r\n\r\nI was much interested, on several occasions, by watching the habits of\r\nan Octopus, or cuttle-fish. Although common in the pools of water left\r\nby the retiring tide, these animals were not easily caught. By means of\r\ntheir long arms and suckers, they could drag their bodies into very\r\nnarrow crevices; and when thus fixed, it required great force to remove\r\nthem. At other times they darted tail first, with the rapidity of an\r\narrow, from one side of the pool to the other, at the same instant\r\ndiscolouring the water with a dark chestnut-brown ink. These animals\r\nalso escape detection by a very extraordinary, chameleon-like power of\r\nchanging their colour. They appear to vary their tints according to the\r\nnature of the ground over which they pass: when in deep water, their\r\ngeneral shade was brownish purple, but when placed on the land, or in\r\nshallow water, this dark tint changed into one of a yellowish green.\r\nThe colour, examined more carefully, was a French grey, with numerous\r\nminute spots of bright yellow: the former of these varied in intensity;\r\nthe latter entirely disappeared and appeared again by turns. These\r\nchanges were effected in such a manner that clouds, varying in tint\r\nbetween a hyacinth red and a chestnut-brown,[4] were continually\r\npassing over the body. Any part, being subjected to a slight shock of\r\ngalvanism, became almost black: a similar effect, but in a less degree,\r\nwas produced by scratching the skin with a needle. These clouds, or\r\nblushes as they may be called, are said to be produced by the alternate\r\nexpansion and contraction of minute vesicles containing variously\r\ncoloured fluids.[5]\r\n\r\n [4] So named according to Patrick Symes’s nomenclature.\r\n\r\n\r\n [5] See _Encyclopedia of Anatomy and Physiology_ article\r\n “Cephalopoda.”\r\n\r\nThis cuttle-fish displayed its chameleon-like power both during the act\r\nof swimming and whilst remaining stationary at the bottom. I was much\r\namused by the various arts to escape detection used by one individual,\r\nwhich seemed fully aware that I was watching it. Remaining for a time\r\nmotionless, it would then stealthily advance an inch or two, like a cat\r\nafter a mouse; sometimes changing its colour: it thus proceeded, till\r\nhaving\r\ngained a deeper part, it darted away, leaving a dusky train of ink to\r\nhide the hole into which it had crawled.\r\n\r\nWhile looking for marine animals, with my head about two feet above the\r\nrocky shore, I was more than once saluted by a jet of water,\r\naccompanied by a slight grating noise. At first I could not think what\r\nit was, but afterwards I found out that it was this cuttle-fish, which,\r\nthough concealed in a hole, thus often led me to its discovery. That it\r\npossesses the power of ejecting water there is no doubt, and it\r\nappeared to me that it could certainly take good aim by directing the\r\ntube or siphon on the under side of its body. From the difficulty which\r\nthese animals have in carrying their heads, they cannot crawl with ease\r\nwhen placed on the ground. I observed that one which I kept in the\r\ncabin was slightly phosphorescent in the dark.\r\n\r\nST. PAUL’S ROCKS.—In crossing the Atlantic we hove-to, during the\r\nmorning of February 16th, 1832, close to the island of St. Paul’s. This\r\ncluster of rocks is situated in 0° 58′ north latitude, and 29° 15′ west\r\nlongitude. It is 540 miles distant from the coast of America, and 350\r\nfrom the island of Fernando Noronha. The highest point is only fifty\r\nfeet above the level of the sea, and the entire circumference is under\r\nthree-quarters of a mile. This small point rises abruptly out of the\r\ndepths of the ocean. Its mineralogical constitution is not simple; in\r\nsome parts the rock is of a cherty, in others of a feldspathic nature,\r\nincluding thin veins of serpentine. It is a remarkable fact that all\r\nthe many small islands, lying far from any continent, in the Pacific,\r\nIndian, and Atlantic Oceans, with the exception of the Seychelles and\r\nthis little point of rock, are, I believe, composed either of coral or\r\nof erupted matter. The volcanic nature of these oceanic islands is\r\nevidently an extension of that law, and the effect of those same\r\ncauses, whether chemical or mechanical, from which it results that a\r\nvast majority of the volcanoes now in action stand either near\r\nsea-coasts or as islands in the midst of the sea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe rocks of St. Paul appear from a distance of a brilliantly white\r\ncolour. This is partly owing to the dung of a vast multitude of\r\nseafowl, and partly to a coating of a hard glossy substance with a\r\npearly lustre, which is intimately united to the surface of the rocks.\r\nThis, when examined with a lens, is\r\nfound to consist of numerous exceedingly thin layers, its total\r\nthickness being about the tenth of an inch. It contains much animal\r\nmatter, and its origin, no doubt, is due to the action of the rain or\r\nspray on the birds’ dung. Below some small masses of guano at\r\nAscension, and on the Abrolhos Islets, I found certain stalactitic\r\nbranching bodies, formed apparently in the same manner as the thin\r\nwhite coating on these rocks. The branching bodies so closely resembled\r\nin general appearance certain nulliporæ (a family of hard calcareous\r\nsea-plants), that in lately looking hastily over my collection I did\r\nnot perceive the difference. The globular extremities of the branches\r\nare of a pearly texture, like the enamel of teeth, but so hard as just\r\nto scratch plate-glass. I may here mention, that on a part of the coast\r\nof Ascension, where there is a vast accumulation of shelly sand, an\r\nincrustation is deposited on the tidal rocks, by the water of the sea,\r\nresembling, as represented in the picture above, certain cryptogamic\r\nplants (Marchantiæ) often seen on damp walls. The surface of the fronds\r\nis beautifully glossy; and those parts formed where fully exposed to\r\nthe light, are of a jet black colour, but those shaded under ledges are\r\nonly grey. I have shown specimens of this incrustation to several\r\ngeologists, and they all thought that they were of volcanic or igneous\r\norigin! In its hardness and translucency—in its polish, equal to that\r\nof the finest oliva-shell—in the bad smell given out, and loss of\r\ncolour under the blowpipe—it shows a close similarity with living\r\nsea-shells. Moreover in sea-shells, it is known that the parts\r\nhabitually covered and shaded by the mantle of the animal, are of a\r\npaler colour than those fully exposed to the light, just as is the case\r\nwith this incrustation. When we remember that lime, either as a\r\nphosphate or carbonate, enters into the composition of the hard parts,\r\nsuch as bones and shells, of all living animals, it is an interesting\r\nphysiological\r\nfact[6] to find substances harder than the enamel of teeth, and\r\ncoloured surfaces as well polished as those of a fresh shell, re-formed\r\nthrough inorganic means from dead organic matter—mocking, also, in\r\nshape, some of the lower vegetable productions.\r\n\r\n [6] Mr. Horner and Sir David Brewster have described (_Philosophical\r\n Transactions_, 1836, p. 65) a singular “artificial substance\r\n resembling shell.” It is deposited in fine, transparent, highly\r\n polished, brown-coloured laminæ, possessing peculiar optical\r\n properties, on the inside of a vessel, in which cloth, first prepared\r\n with glue and then with lime, is made to revolve rapidly in water. It\r\n is much softer, more transparent, and contains more animal matter,\r\n than the natural incrustation at Ascension; but we here again see the\r\n strong tendency which carbonate of lime and animal matter evince to\r\n form a solid substance allied to shell.\r\n\r\nWe found on St. Paul’s only two kinds of birds—the booby and the noddy.\r\nThe former is a species of gannet, and the latter a tern. Both are of a\r\ntame and stupid disposition, and are so unaccustomed to visitors, that\r\nI could have killed any number of them with my geological hammer. The\r\nbooby lays her eggs on the bare rock; but the tern makes a very simple\r\nnest with seaweed. By the side of many of these nests a small\r\nflying-fish was placed; which I suppose, had been brought by the male\r\nbird for its partner. It was amusing to watch how quickly a large and\r\nactive crab (Graspus), which inhabits the crevices of the rock, stole\r\nthe fish from the side of the nest, as soon as we had disturbed the\r\nparent birds. Sir W. Symonds, one of the few persons who have landed\r\nhere, informs me that he saw the crabs dragging even the young birds\r\nout of their nests, and devouring them. Not a single plant, not even a\r\nlichen, grows on this islet; yet it is inhabited by several insects and\r\nspiders. The following list completes, I believe, the terrestrial\r\nfauna: a fly (Olfersia) living on the booby, and a tick which must have\r\ncome here as a parasite on the birds; a small brown moth, belonging to\r\na genus that feeds on feathers; a beetle (Quedius) and a woodlouse from\r\nbeneath the dung; and lastly, numerous spiders, which I suppose prey on\r\nthese small attendants and scavengers of the waterfowl. The\r\noften-repeated description of the stately palm and other noble tropical\r\nplants, then birds, and lastly man, taking possession of the coral\r\nislets as soon as formed, in the Pacific, is probably not quite\r\ncorrect; I fear it destroys the poetry of this story, that feather and\r\ndirt-feeding and parasitic insects and spiders should be the first\r\ninhabitants of newly formed oceanic land.\r\n\r\nThe smallest rock in the tropical seas, by giving a foundation\r\nfor the growth of innumerable kinds of seaweed and compound animals,\r\nsupports likewise a large number of fish. The sharks and the seamen in\r\nthe boats maintained a constant struggle which should secure the\r\ngreater share of the prey caught by the fishing-lines. I have heard\r\nthat a rock near the Bermudas, lying many miles out at sea, and at a\r\nconsiderable depth, was first discovered by the circumstance of fish\r\nhaving been observed in the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nFERNANDO NORONHA, _Feb_. 20_th._—As far as I was enabled to observe,\r\nduring the few hours we stayed at this place, the constitution of the\r\nisland is volcanic, but probably not of a recent date. The most\r\nremarkable feature is a conical hill, about one thousand feet high, the\r\nupper part of which is exceedingly steep, and on one side overhangs its\r\nbase. The rock is phonolite, and is divided into irregular columns. On\r\nviewing one of these isolated masses, at first one is inclined to\r\nbelieve that it has been suddenly pushed up in a semi-fluid state. At\r\nSt. Helena, however, I ascertained that some pinnacles, of a nearly\r\nsimilar figure and constitution, had been formed by the injection of\r\nmelted rock into yielding strata, which thus had formed the moulds for\r\nthese gigantic obelisks. The whole island is covered with wood; but\r\nfrom the dryness of the climate there is no appearance of luxuriance.\r\nHalf-way up the mountain some great masses of the columnar rock, shaded\r\nby laurel-like trees, and ornamented by others covered with fine pink\r\nflowers but without a single leaf, gave a pleasing effect to the nearer\r\nparts of the scenery.\r\n\r\nBAHIA, OR SAN SALVADOR. BRAZIL, _Feb_. 29_th._—The day has past\r\ndelightfully. Delight itself, however, is a weak term to express the\r\nfeelings of a naturalist who, for the first time, has wandered by\r\nhimself in a Brazilian forest. The elegance of the grasses, the novelty\r\nof the parasitical plants, the beauty of the flowers, the glossy green\r\nof the foliage, but above all the general luxuriance of the vegetation,\r\nfilled me with admiration. A most paradoxical mixture of sound and\r\nsilence pervades the shady parts of the wood. The noise from the\r\ninsects is so loud, that it may be heard even in a vessel anchored\r\nseveral hundred yards from the shore; yet within the recesses of the\r\nforest a universal silence appears to reign. To a person fond of\r\nnatural\r\nhistory, such a day as this brings with it a deeper pleasure than he\r\ncan ever hope to experience again. After wandering about for some\r\nhours, I returned to the landing-place; but, before reaching it, I was\r\novertaken by a tropical storm. I tried to find shelter under a tree,\r\nwhich was so thick that it would never have been penetrated by common\r\nEnglish rain; but here, in a couple of minutes, a little torrent flowed\r\ndown the trunk. It is to this violence of the rain that we must\r\nattribute the verdure at the bottom of the thickest woods: if the\r\nshowers were like those of a colder clime, the greater part would be\r\nabsorbed or evaporated before it reached the ground. I will not at\r\npresent attempt to describe the gaudy scenery of this noble bay,\r\nbecause, in our homeward voyage, we called here a second time, and I\r\nshall then have occasion to remark on it.\r\n\r\nAlong the whole coast of Brazil, for a length of at least 2000 miles,\r\nand certainly for a considerable space inland, wherever solid rock\r\noccurs, it belongs to a granitic formation. The circumstance of this\r\nenormous area being constituted of materials which most geologists\r\nbelieve to have been crystallised when heated under pressure, gives\r\nrise to many curious reflections. Was this effect produced beneath the\r\ndepths of a profound ocean? or did a covering of strata formerly extend\r\nover it, which has since been removed? Can we believe that any power,\r\nacting for a time short of infinity, could have denuded the granite\r\nover so many thousand square leagues?\r\n\r\nOn a point not far from the city, where a rivulet entered the sea, I\r\nobserved a fact connected with a subject discussed by Humboldt.[7] At\r\nthe cataracts of the great rivers Orinoco, Nile, and Congo, the\r\nsyenitic rocks are coated by a black substance, appearing as if they\r\nhad been polished with plumbago. The layer is of extreme thinness; and\r\non analysis by Berzelius it was found to consist of the oxides of\r\nmanganese and iron. In the Orinoco it occurs on the rocks periodically\r\nwashed by the floods, and in those parts alone where the stream is\r\nrapid; or, as the Indians say, “the rocks are black where the waters\r\nare white.” Here the coating is of a rich brown instead of a black\r\ncolour, and seems to be composed of ferruginous matter alone. Hand\r\nspecimens fail to give a just idea of these brown burnished stones\r\nwhich glitter in the sun’s rays. They occur only within\r\nthe limits of the tidal waves; and as the rivulet slowly trickles down,\r\nthe surf must supply the polishing power of the cataracts in the great\r\nrivers. In like manner, the rise and fall of the tide probably answer\r\nto the periodical inundations; and thus the same effects are produced\r\nunder apparently different but really similar circumstances. The\r\norigin, however, of these coatings of metallic oxides, which seem as if\r\ncemented to the rocks, is not understood; and no reason, I believe, can\r\nbe assigned for their thickness remaining the same.\r\n\r\n [7] _Personal Narrative,_ vol. v, pt. i, p. 18.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nOne day I was amused by watching the habits of the Diodon antennatus,\r\nwhich was caught swimming near the shore. This fish, with its flabby\r\nskin, is well known to possess the singular power of distending itself\r\ninto a nearly spherical form. After having been taken out of water for\r\na short time, and then again immersed in it, a considerable quantity\r\nboth of water and air is absorbed by the mouth, and perhaps likewise by\r\nthe branchial orifices. This process is effected by two methods: the\r\nair is swallowed, and is then forced into the cavity of the body, its\r\nreturn being prevented by a muscular contraction which is externally\r\nvisible: but the water enters in a gentle stream through the mouth,\r\nwhich is kept wide open and motionless; this latter action must,\r\ntherefore, depend on suction. The skin about the abdomen is much looser\r\nthan that on the back; hence, during the inflation, the lower surface\r\nbecomes far more distended than the upper; and the fish, in\r\nconsequence, floats with its back downwards. Cuvier doubts whether the\r\nDiodon in this position is able to swim; but not only can it thus move\r\nforward in a straight line, but it can turn round to either side. This\r\nlatter movement is effected solely by the aid of the pectoral fins; the\r\ntail being collapsed and not used. From the body being buoyed up with\r\nso much air, the branchial openings are out of water, but a stream\r\ndrawn in by the mouth constantly flows through them.\r\n\r\nThe fish, having remained in this distended state for a short time,\r\ngenerally expelled the air and water with considerable force from the\r\nbranchial apertures and mouth. It could emit, at will, a certain\r\nportion of the water, and it appears, therefore probable that this\r\nfluid is taken in partly for the sake of regulating its specific\r\ngravity. This Diodon possessed several means of defence. It could give\r\na severe bite, and could eject water from its mouth to some distance,\r\nat the same time making a curious noise by the movement of its jaws. By\r\nthe inflation of its body, the papillæ, with which the skin is\r\ncovered, become erect and pointed. But the most curious circumstance\r\nis, that it secretes from the skin of its belly, when handled, a most\r\nbeautiful carmine-red fibrous matter, which stains ivory and paper in\r\nso permanent a manner, that the tint is retained with all its\r\nbrightness to the present day: I am quite ignorant of the nature and\r\nuse of this secretion. I have heard from Dr. Allan of Forres, that he\r\nhas frequently found a Diodon, floating alive and distended, in the\r\nstomach of the shark; and that on several occasions he has known it eat\r\nits way, not only through the coats of the stomach, but through the\r\nsides of the monster, which has thus been killed. Who would ever have\r\nimagined that a little soft fish could have destroyed the great and\r\nsavage shark?\r\n\r\n\r\n_March_ 18_th._—We sailed from Bahia. A few days afterwards, when not\r\nfar distant from the Abrolhos Islets, my attention\r\nwas called to a reddish-brown appearance in the sea. The whole surface\r\nof the water, as it appeared under a weak lens, seemed as if covered by\r\nchopped bits of hay, with their ends jagged. These are minute\r\ncylindrical confervæ, in bundles or rafts of from twenty to sixty in\r\neach. Mr. Berkeley informs me that they are the same species\r\n(Trichodesmium erythræum) with that found over large spaces in the Red\r\nSea, and whence its name of Red Sea is derived.[8] Their numbers must\r\nbe infinite: the ship passed through several bands of them, one of\r\nwhich was about ten yards wide, and, judging from the mud-like colour\r\nof the water, at least two and a half miles long. In almost every long\r\nvoyage some account is given of these confervæ. They appear especially\r\ncommon in the sea near Australia; and off Cape Leeuwin I found an\r\nallied, but smaller and apparently different species. Captain Cook, in\r\nhis third voyage, remarks that the sailors gave to this appearance the\r\nname of sea-sawdust.\r\n\r\n [8] M. Montagne in _Comptes Rendus_, etc. Juillet 1844; and _Annales\r\n des Sciences Naturelles_, December 1844.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nNear Keeling Atoll, in the Indian Ocean, I observed many little masses\r\nof confervæ a few inches square, consisting of long cylindrical threads\r\nof excessive thinness, so as to be barely visible to the naked eye,\r\nmingled with other rather larger bodies, finely conical at both ends.\r\nTwo of these are shown above united together. They vary in length from\r\n.04 to .06, and even to .08 of an inch in length; and in diameter from\r\n.006 to .008 of an inch. Near one extremity of the cylindrical part, a\r\ngreen septum, formed of granular matter, and thickest in the middle,\r\nmay generally be seen. This, I believe, is the bottom of a most\r\ndelicate, colourless sac, composed of a pulpy substance, which lines\r\nthe exterior case, but does not extend within the extreme conical\r\npoints. In some specimens, small but perfect spheres of brownish\r\ngranular matter supplied the places of the septa; and I observed the\r\ncurious process by which they were produced. The pulpy matter of the\r\ninternal coating suddenly grouped itself into lines, some of which\r\nassumed a form radiating from a common centre; it then continued, with\r\nan irregular and rapid movement, to contract itself, so that in the\r\ncourse of a second\r\nthe whole was united into a perfect little sphere, which occupied the\r\nposition of the septum at one end of the now quite hollow case. The\r\nformation of the granular sphere was hastened by any accidental injury.\r\nI may add, that frequently a pair of these bodies were attached to each\r\nother, as represented above, cone beside cone, at that end where the\r\nseptum occurs.\r\n\r\nI will here add a few other observations connected with the\r\ndiscoloration of the sea from organic causes. On the coast of Chile, a\r\nfew leagues north of Concepcion, the _Beagle_ one day passed through\r\ngreat bands of muddy water, exactly like that of a swollen river; and\r\nagain, a degree south of Valparaiso, when fifty miles from the land,\r\nthe same appearance was still more extensive. Some of the water placed\r\nin a glass was of a pale reddish tint; and, examined under a\r\nmicroscope, was seen to swarm with minute animalcula darting about, and\r\noften exploding. Their shape is oval, and contracted in the middle by a\r\nring of vibrating curved ciliæ. It was, however, very difficult to\r\nexamine them with care, for almost the instant motion ceased, even\r\nwhile crossing the field of vision, their bodies burst. Sometimes both\r\nends burst at once, sometimes only one, and a quantity of coarse,\r\nbrownish, granular matter was ejected. The animal an instant before\r\nbursting expanded to half again its natural size; and the explosion\r\ntook place about fifteen seconds after the rapid progressive motion had\r\nceased: in a few cases it was preceded for a short interval by a\r\nrotatory movement on the longer axis. About two minutes after any\r\nnumber were isolated in a drop of water, they thus perished. The\r\nanimals move with the narrow apex forwards, by the aid of their\r\nvibratory ciliæ, and generally by rapid starts. They are exceedingly\r\nminute, and quite invisible to the naked eye, only covering a space\r\nequal to the square of the thousandth of an inch. Their numbers were\r\ninfinite; for the smallest drop of water which I could remove contained\r\nvery many. In one day we passed through two spaces of water thus\r\nstained, one of which alone must have extended over several square\r\nmiles. What incalculable numbers of these microscopical animals! The\r\ncolour of the water, as seen at some distance, was like that of a river\r\nwhich has flowed through a red clay district; but under the shade of\r\nthe vessel’s side it was quite as dark as chocolate. The line where the\r\nred and blue water joined was distinctly\r\ndefined. The weather for some days previously had been calm, and the\r\nocean abounded, to an unusual degree, with living creatures.[9]\r\n\r\n [9] M. Lesson (_Voyage de la Coquille_, tome i, p. 255) mentions red\r\n water off Lima, apparently produced by the same cause. Peron, the\r\n distinguished naturalist, in the _Voyage aux Terres Australes_, gives\r\n no less than twelve references to voyagers who have alluded to the\r\n discoloured waters of the sea (vol. ii, p. 239). To the references\r\n given by Peron may be added, Humboldt’s _Personal Narrative_, vol. vi,\r\n p. 804; Flinder’s _Voyage_, vol. i, p. 92; Labillardière, vol. i, p.\r\n 287; Ulloa’s _Voyage_; _Voyage of the Astrolabe and of the Coquille_;\r\n Captain King’s _Survey of Australia_, etc.\r\n\r\nIn the sea around Tierra del Fuego, and at no great distance from the\r\nland, I have seen narrow lines of water of a bright red colour, from\r\nthe number of crustacea, which somewhat resemble in form large prawns.\r\nThe sealers call them whale-food. Whether whales feed on them I do not\r\nknow; but terns, cormorants, and immense herds of great unwieldy seals\r\nderive, on some parts of the coast, their chief sustenance from these\r\nswimming crabs. Seamen invariably attribute the discoloration of the\r\nwater to spawn; but I found this to be the case only on one occasion.\r\nAt the distance of several leagues from the Archipelago of the\r\nGalapagos, the ship sailed through three strips of a dark yellowish, or\r\nmud-like water; these strips were some miles long, but only a few yards\r\nwide, and they were separated from the surrounding water by a sinuous\r\nyet distinct margin. The colour was caused by little gelatinous balls,\r\nabout the fifth of an inch in diameter, in which numerous minute\r\nspherical ovules were embedded: they were of two distinct kinds, one\r\nbeing of a reddish colour and of a different shape from the other. I\r\ncannot form a conjecture as to what two kinds of animals these\r\nbelonged. Captain Colnett remarks that this appearance is very common\r\namong the Galapagos Islands, and that the direction of the bands\r\nindicates that of the currents; in the described case, however, the\r\nline was caused by the wind. The only other appearance which I have to\r\nnotice, is a thin oily coat on the water which displays iridescent\r\ncolours. I saw a considerable tract of the ocean thus covered on the\r\ncoast of Brazil; the seamen attributed it to the putrefying carcass of\r\nsome whale, which probably was floating at no great distance. I do not\r\nhere mention the minute gelatinous particles, hereafter to be referred\r\nto, which are frequently dispersed throughout the water, for they are\r\nnot sufficiently abundant to create any change of colour.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are two circumstances in the above accounts which appear\r\nremarkable: first, how do the various bodies which form the bands with\r\ndefined edges keep together? In the case of the prawn-like crabs, their\r\nmovements were as coinstantaneous as in a regiment of soldiers; but\r\nthis cannot happen from anything like voluntary action with the ovules,\r\nor the confervæ, nor is it probable among the infusoria. Secondly,\r\nwhat causes the length and narrowness of the bands? The appearance so\r\nmuch resembles that which may be seen in every torrent, where the\r\nstream uncoils into long streaks the froth collected in the eddies,\r\nthat I must attribute the effect to a similar action either of the\r\ncurrents of the air or sea. Under this supposition we must believe that\r\nthe various organised bodies are produced in certain favourable places,\r\nand are thence removed by the set of either wind or water. I confess,\r\nhowever, there is a very great difficulty in imagining any one spot to\r\nbe the birthplace of the millions of millions of animalcula and\r\nconfervæ: for whence come the germs at such points?—the parent bodies\r\nhaving been distributed by the winds and waves over the immense ocean.\r\nBut on no other hypothesis can I understand their linear grouping. I\r\nmay add that Scoresby remarks that green water abounding with pelagic\r\nanimals is invariably found in a certain part of the Arctic Sea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter II\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nRio de Janeiro—Excursion north of Cape Frio—Great\r\nEvaporation—Slavery—Botofogo Bay—Terrestrial Planariæ—Clouds on the\r\nCorcovado—Heavy Rain—Musical Frogs—Phosphorescent Insects—Elater,\r\nspringing powers of—Blue Haze—Noise made by a\r\nButterfly—Entomology—Ants—Wasp killing a Spider—Parasitical\r\nSpider—Artifices of an Epeira—Gregarious Spider—Spider with an\r\nunsymmetrical Web.\r\n\r\nRIO DE JANEIRO.\r\n\r\n_April_ 4_th to July_ 5_th_, 1832.—A few days after our arrival I\r\nbecame acquainted with an Englishman who was going to visit his estate,\r\nsituated rather more than a hundred miles from the capital, to the\r\nnorthward of Cape Frio. I gladly accepted his kind offer of allowing me\r\nto accompany him.\r\n\r\n_April_ 8_th_, 1832.—Our party amounted to seven. The first stage was\r\nvery interesting. The day was powerfully hot, and as we passed through\r\nthe woods, everything was motionless, excepting the large and brilliant\r\nbutterflies, which lazily fluttered about. The view seen when crossing\r\nthe hills behind Praia Grande was most beautiful; the colours were\r\nintense, and the prevailing tint a dark blue; the sky and the calm\r\nwaters of the bay vied with each other in splendour. After passing\r\nthrough some cultivated country, we entered a forest which in the\r\ngrandeur of all its parts could not be exceeded. We arrived by midday\r\nat\r\nIthacaia; this small village is situated on a plain, and round the\r\ncentral house are the huts of the negroes. These, from their regular\r\nform and position, reminded me of the drawings of the Hottentot\r\nhabitations in Southern Africa. As the moon rose early, we determined\r\nto start the same evening for our sleeping-place at the Lagoa Marica.\r\nAs it was growing dark we passed under one of the massive, bare, and\r\nsteep hills of granite which are so common in this country. This spot\r\nis notorious from having been, for a long time, the residence of some\r\nrunaway slaves, who, by cultivating a little ground near the top,\r\ncontrived to eke out a subsistence. At length they were discovered, and\r\na party of soldiers being sent, the whole were seized with the\r\nexception of one old woman, who, sooner than again be led into slavery,\r\ndashed herself to pieces from the summit of the mountain. In a Roman\r\nmatron this would have been called the noble love of freedom: in a poor\r\nnegress it is mere brutal obstinacy. We continued riding for some\r\nhours. For the few last miles the road was intricate, and it passed\r\nthrough a desert waste of marshes and lagoons. The scene by the dimmed\r\nlight of the moon was most desolate. A few fireflies flitted by us; and\r\nthe solitary snipe, as it rose, uttered its plaintive cry. The distant\r\nand sullen roar of the sea scarcely broke the stillness of the night.\r\n\r\n_April_ 9_th_, 1832.—We left our miserable sleeping-place before\r\nsunrise. The road passed through a narrow sandy plain, lying between\r\nthe sea and the interior salt lagoons. The number of beautiful fishing\r\nbirds, such as egrets and cranes, and the succulent plants assuming\r\nmost fantastical forms, gave to the scene an interest which it would\r\nnot otherwise have possessed. The few stunted trees were loaded with\r\nparasitical plants, among which the beauty and delicious fragrance of\r\nsome of the orchideæ were most to be admired. As the sun rose, the day\r\nbecame extremely hot, and the reflection of the light and heat from the\r\nwhite sand was very distressing. We dined at Mandetiba; the thermometer\r\nin the shade being 84°. The beautiful view of the distant wooded hills,\r\nreflected in the perfectly calm water of an extensive lagoon, quite\r\nrefreshed us. As the vênda[1] here was a very good one, and I have the\r\npleasant, but rare remembrance, of an excellent dinner, I will be\r\ngrateful and\r\npresently describe it, as the type of its class. These houses are often\r\nlarge, and are built of thick upright posts, with boughs interwoven,\r\nand afterwards plastered. They seldom have floors, and never glazed\r\nwindows; but are generally pretty well roofed. Universally the front\r\npart is open, forming a kind of verandah, in which tables and benches\r\nare placed. The bedrooms join on each side, and here the passenger may\r\nsleep as comfortably as he can, on a wooden platform covered by a thin\r\nstraw mat. The vênda stands in a courtyard, where the horses are fed.\r\nOn first arriving, it was our custom to unsaddle the horses and give\r\nthem their Indian corn; then, with a low bow, to ask the senhôr to do\r\nus the favour to give us something to eat. “Anything you choose, sir,”\r\nwas his usual answer. For the few first times, vainly I thanked\r\nProvidence for having guided us to so good a man. The conversation\r\nproceeding, the case universally became deplorable. “Any fish can you\r\ndo us the favour of giving ?”—“Oh no, sir.”—“Any soup?”—“No, sir.”—“Any\r\nbread?”—“Oh no, sir.”—“Any dried meat?”—“Oh no, sir.” If we were lucky,\r\nby waiting a couple of hours, we obtained fowls, rice, and farinha. It\r\nnot unfrequently happened that we were obliged to kill, with stones,\r\nthe poultry for our own supper. When, thoroughly exhausted by fatigue\r\nand hunger, we timorously hinted that we should be glad of our meal,\r\nthe pompous, and (though true) most unsatisfactory answer was, “It will\r\nbe ready when it is ready.” If we had dared to remonstrate any further,\r\nwe should have been told to proceed on our journey, as being too\r\nimpertinent. The hosts are most ungracious and disagreeable in their\r\nmanners; their houses and their persons are often filthily dirty; the\r\nwant of the accommodation of forks, knives, and spoons is common; and I\r\nam sure no cottage or hovel in England could be found in a state so\r\nutterly destitute of every comfort. At Campos Novos, however, we fared\r\nsumptuously; having rice and fowls, biscuit, wine, and spirits, for\r\ndinner; coffee in the evening, and fish with coffee for breakfast. All\r\nthis, with good food for the horses, only cost 2 shillings 6 pence per\r\nhead. Yet the host of this vênda, being asked if he knew anything of a\r\nwhip which one of the party had lost, gruffly answered, “How should I\r\nknow? why did you not take care of it?—I suppose the dogs have eaten\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n [1] Vênda, the Portuguese name for an inn.\r\n\r\nLeaving Mandetiba, we continued to pass through an\r\nintricate wilderness of lakes; in some of which were fresh, in others\r\nsalt water shells. Of the former kind, I found a Limnæa in great\r\nnumbers in a lake, into which the inhabitants assured me that the sea\r\nenters once a year, and sometimes oftener, and makes the water quite\r\nsalt. I have no doubt many interesting facts in relation to marine and\r\nfresh-water animals might be observed in this chain of lagoons which\r\nskirt the coast of Brazil. M. Gay[2] has stated that he found in the\r\nneighbourhood of Rio shells of the marine genera solen and mytilus, and\r\nfresh-water ampullariæ, living together in brackish water. I also\r\nfrequently observed in the lagoon near the Botanic Garden, where the\r\nwater is only a little less salt than in the sea, a species of\r\nhydrophilus, very similar to a water-beetle common in the ditches of\r\nEngland: in the same lake the only shell belonged to a genus generally\r\nfound in estuaries.\r\n\r\n [2] _Annales des Sciences Naturelles_ for 1833.\r\n\r\nLeaving the coast for a time, we again entered the forest. The trees\r\nwere very lofty, and remarkable, compared with those of Europe, from\r\nthe whiteness of their trunks. I see by my notebook, “wonderful and\r\nbeautiful flowering parasites,” invariably struck me as the most novel\r\nobject in these grand scenes. Travelling onwards we passed through\r\ntracts of pasturage, much injured by the enormous conical ants’ nests,\r\nwhich were nearly twelve feet high. They gave to the plain exactly the\r\nappearance of the mud volcanoes at Jorullo, as figured by Humboldt. We\r\narrived at Engenhodo after it was dark, having been ten hours on\r\nhorseback. I never ceased, during the whole journey, to be surprised at\r\nthe amount of labour which the horses were capable of enduring; they\r\nappeared also to recover from any injury much sooner than those of our\r\nEnglish breed. The Vampire bat is often the cause of much trouble, by\r\nbiting the horses on their withers. The injury is generally not so much\r\nowing to the loss of blood, as to the inflammation which the pressure\r\nof the saddle afterwards produces. The whole circumstance has lately\r\nbeen doubted in England; I was therefore fortunate in being present\r\nwhen one (Desmodus d’orbignyi, Wat.) was actually caught on a horse’s\r\nback. We were bivouacking late one evening near Coquimbo, in Chile,\r\nwhen my servant, noticing that one of the horses was very restive, went\r\nto see what was the matter, and fancying he could distinguish\r\nsomething,\r\nsuddenly put his hand on the beast’s withers, and secured the vampire.\r\nIn the morning the spot where the bite had been inflicted was easily\r\ndistinguished from being slightly swollen and bloody. The third day\r\nafterwards we rode the horse, without any ill effects.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n_April_ 13_th_, 1832.—After three days’ travelling we arrived at\r\nSocêgo, the estate of Senhôr Manuel Figuireda, a relation of one of our\r\nparty. The house was simple, and, though like a barn in form, was well\r\nsuited to the climate. In the sitting-room gilded chairs and sofas were\r\noddly contrasted with the whitewashed walls, thatched roof, and windows\r\nwithout glass. The house, together with the granaries, the stables, and\r\nworkshops for the blacks, who had been taught various trades, formed a\r\nrude kind of quadrangle; in the centre of which a large pile of coffee\r\nwas drying. These buildings stand on a little hill, overlooking the\r\ncultivated ground, and surrounded on every side by a wall of dark green\r\nluxuriant forest. The chief produce of this part of the country is\r\ncoffee. Each tree is supposed to yield annually, on an average, two\r\npounds; but some give as much as eight. Mandioca or cassava is likewise\r\ncultivated in\r\ngreat quantity. Every part of this plant is useful: the leaves and\r\nstalks are eaten by the horses, and the roots are ground into a pulp,\r\nwhich, when pressed dry and baked, forms the farinha, the principal\r\narticle of sustenance in the Brazils. It is a curious, though\r\nwell-known fact, that the juice of this most nutritious plant is highly\r\npoisonous. A few years ago a cow died at this Fazênda, in consequence\r\nof having drunk some of it. Senhôr Figuireda told me that he had\r\nplanted, the year before, one bag of feijaô or beans, and three of\r\nrice; the former of which produced eighty, and the latter three hundred\r\nand twenty fold. The pasturage supports a fine stock of cattle, and the\r\nwoods are so full of game that a deer had been killed on each of the\r\nthree previous days. This profusion of food showed itself at dinner,\r\nwhere, if the tables did not groan, the guests surely did; for each\r\nperson is expected to eat of every dish. One day, having, as I thought,\r\nnicely calculated so that nothing should go away untasted, to my utter\r\ndismay a roast turkey and a pig appeared in all their substantial\r\nreality. During the meals, it was the employment of a man to drive out\r\nof the room sundry old hounds, and dozens of little black children,\r\nwhich crawled in together, at every opportunity. As long as the idea of\r\nslavery could be banished, there was something exceedingly fascinating\r\nin this simple and patriarchal style of living: it was such a perfect\r\nretirement and independence from the rest of the world. As soon as any\r\nstranger is seen arriving, a large bell is set tolling, and generally\r\nsome small cannon are fired. The event is thus announced to the rocks\r\nand woods, but to nothing else. One morning I walked out an hour before\r\ndaylight to admire the solemn stillness of the scene; at last, the\r\nsilence was broken by the morning hymn, raised on high by the whole\r\nbody of the blacks; and in this manner their daily work is generally\r\nbegun. On such fazêndas as these, I have no doubt the slaves pass happy\r\nand contented lives. On Saturday and Sunday they work for themselves,\r\nand in this fertile climate the labour of two days is sufficient to\r\nsupport a man and his family for the whole week.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n_April_ 14_th_, 1832.—Leaving Socêgo, we rode to another estate on the\r\nRio Macâe, which was the last patch of cultivated ground in that\r\ndirection. The estate was two and a half miles long, and the owner had\r\nforgotten how many broad. Only a very small\r\npiece had been cleared, yet almost every acre was capable of yielding\r\nall the various rich productions of a tropical land. Considering the\r\nenormous area of Brazil, the proportion of cultivated ground can\r\nscarcely be considered as anything compared to that which is left in\r\nthe state of nature: at some future age, how vast a population it will\r\nsupport! During the second day’s journey we found the road so shut up\r\nthat it was necessary that a man should go ahead with a sword to cut\r\naway the creepers. The forest abounded with beautiful objects; among\r\nwhich the tree ferns, though not large, were, from their bright green\r\nfoliage, and the elegant curvature of their fronds, most worthy of\r\nadmiration. In the evening it rained very heavily, and although the\r\nthermometer stood at 65°, I felt very cold. As soon as the rain ceased,\r\nit was curious to observe the extraordinary evaporation which commenced\r\nover the whole extent of the forest. At the height of a hundred feet\r\nthe hills were buried in a dense white vapour, which rose like columns\r\nof smoke from the most thickly-wooded parts, and especially from the\r\nvalleys. I observed this phenomenon on several occasions: I suppose it\r\nis owing to the large surface of foliage, previously heated by the\r\nsun’s rays.\r\n\r\nWhile staying at this estate, I was very nearly being an eye-witness to\r\none of those atrocious acts which can only take place in a slave\r\ncountry. Owing to a quarrel and a lawsuit, the owner was on the point\r\nof taking all the women and children from the male slaves, and selling\r\nthem separately at the public auction at Rio. Interest, and not any\r\nfeeling of compassion, prevented this act. Indeed, I do not believe the\r\ninhumanity of separating thirty families, who had lived together for\r\nmany years, even occurred to the owner. Yet I will pledge myself, that\r\nin humanity and good feeling he was superior to the common run of men.\r\nIt may be said there exists no limit to the blindness of interest and\r\nselfish habit. I may mention one very trifling anecdote, which at the\r\ntime struck me more forcibly than any story of cruelty. I was crossing\r\na ferry with a negro who was uncommonly stupid. In endeavouring to make\r\nhim understand, I talked loud, and made signs, in doing which I passed\r\nmy hand near his face. He, I suppose, thought I was in a passion, and\r\nwas going to strike him; for instantly, with a frightened look and\r\nhalf-shut eyes, he dropped his hands. I shall never\r\nforget my feelings of surprise, disgust, and shame, at seeing a great\r\npowerful man afraid even to ward off a blow, directed, as he thought,\r\nat his face. This man had been trained to a degradation lower than the\r\nslavery of the most helpless animal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n_April_ 18_th_, 1832.—In returning we spent two days at Socêgo, and I\r\nemployed them in collecting insects in the forest. The greater number\r\nof trees, although so lofty, are not more than three or four feet in\r\ncircumference. There are, of course, a few of much greater dimension.\r\nSenhôr Manuel was then making a canoe 70 feet in length from a solid\r\ntrunk, which had originally been 110 feet long, and of great thickness.\r\nThe contrast of palm trees, growing amidst the common branching kinds,\r\nnever fails to give the scene an intertropical character. Here the\r\nwoods were ornamented by the Cabbage Palm—one of the most beautiful of\r\nits family. With a stem so narrow that it might be clasped with the two\r\nhands, it waves its elegant head at the height of forty or fifty feet\r\nabove the ground. The woody creepers, themselves covered by other\r\ncreepers, were of great thickness: some which I measured were two feet\r\nin circumference. Many of the older trees presented a very curious\r\nappearance from the tresses of a liana hanging from their boughs, and\r\nresembling bundles of hay. If the eye was turned from the world of\r\nfoliage above, to the ground beneath, it was attracted by the extreme\r\nelegance of the leaves of the ferns and mimosæ. The latter, in some\r\nparts, covered the surface with a brushwood only a few inches high. In\r\nwalking across these thick beds of mimosæ, a broad track was marked by\r\nthe change of shade, produced by the drooping\r\nof their sensitive petioles. It is easy to specify the individual\r\nobjects of admiration in these grand scenes; but it is not possible to\r\ngive an adequate idea of the higher feelings of wonder, astonishment,\r\nand devotion, which fill and elevate the mind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n_April_ 19_th_, 1832.—Leaving Socêgo, during the two first days we\r\nretraced our steps. It was very wearisome work, as the road generally\r\nran across a glaring hot sandy plain, not far from the coast. I noticed\r\nthat each time the horse put its foot on the fine siliceous sand, a\r\ngentle chirping noise was produced. On the third day we took a\r\ndifferent line, and passed through the gay little village of Madre de\r\nDeôs. This is one of the principal lines of road in Brazil; yet it was\r\nin so bad a state that no wheel vehicle, excepting the clumsy\r\nbullock-wagon, could pass along. In our whole journey we did not cross\r\na single bridge built of stone; and those made of logs of wood were\r\nfrequently so much out of repair that it was necessary to go on one\r\nside to avoid them. All distances are inaccurately known. The road is\r\noften marked by crosses, in the place of milestones, to signify where\r\nhuman blood has been spilled. On the evening of the 23rd we arrived at\r\nRio, having finished our pleasant little excursion.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the remainder of my stay at Rio, I resided in a cottage at\r\nBotofogo Bay. It was impossible to wish for anything more delightful\r\nthan thus to spend some weeks in so magnificent a country. In England\r\nany person fond of natural history enjoys in his walks a great\r\nadvantage, by always having something to attract his attention; but in\r\nthese fertile climates, teeming with life, the attractions are so\r\nnumerous, that he is scarcely able to walk at all.\r\n\r\nThe few observations which I was enabled to make were almost\r\nexclusively confined to the invertebrate animals. The existence of a\r\ndivision of the genus Planaria, which inhabits the dry land, interested\r\nme much. These animals are of so simple a structure, that Cuvier has\r\narranged them with the intestinal worms, though never found within the\r\nbodies of other animals. Numerous species inhabit both salt and fresh\r\nwater; but those to which I allude were found, even in the drier parts\r\nof the forest, beneath logs of rotten wood, on which I believe they\r\nfeed. In general form they resemble little slugs, but are very much\r\nnarrower in proportion, and several of the species are beautifully\r\ncoloured with longitudinal stripes. Their structure is very simple:\r\nnear the middle of the under or crawling surface there are two small\r\ntransverse slits, from the anterior one of which a funnel-shaped and\r\nhighly irritable mouth can be protruded. For some time after the rest\r\nof the animal was completely dead from the effects of salt water or any\r\nother cause, this organ still retained its vitality.\r\n\r\nI found no less than twelve different species of terrestrial Planariæ\r\nin different parts of the southern hemisphere.[3] Some specimens which\r\nI obtained at Van Diemen’s Land, I kept alive for nearly two months,\r\nfeeding them on rotten wood. Having cut one of them transversely into\r\ntwo nearly equal parts, in the course of a fortnight both had the shape\r\nof perfect animals. I had, however, so divided the body, that one of\r\nthe halves contained both the inferior orifices, and the other, in\r\nconsequence, none. In the course of twenty-five days from the\r\noperation, the more perfect half could not have been distinguished from\r\nany other specimen. The other had increased much in size; and towards\r\nits posterior end, a clear space was formed in the parenchymatous mass,\r\nin which a rudimentary cup-shaped mouth could clearly be distinguished;\r\non the under surface, however, no corresponding slit was yet open. If\r\nthe increased heat of the\r\nweather, as we approached the equator, had not destroyed all the\r\nindividuals, there can be no doubt that this last step would have\r\ncompleted its structure. Although so well known an experiment, it was\r\ninteresting to watch the gradual production of every essential organ,\r\nout of the simple extremity of another animal. It is extremely\r\ndifficult to preserve these Planariæ; as soon as the cessation of life\r\nallows the ordinary laws of change to act, their entire bodies become\r\nsoft and fluid, with a rapidity which I have never seen equalled.\r\n\r\n [3] I have described and named these species in the _Annals of Natural\r\n History_, vol. xiv, p. 241.\r\n\r\nI first visited the forest in which these Planariæ were found, in\r\ncompany with an old Portuguese priest who took me out to hunt with him.\r\nThe sport consisted in turning into the cover a few dogs, and then\r\npatiently waiting to fire at any animal which might appear. We were\r\naccompanied by the son of a neighbouring farmer—a good specimen of a\r\nwild Brazilian youth. He was dressed in a tattered old shirt and\r\ntrousers, and had his head uncovered: he carried an old-fashioned gun\r\nand a large knife. The habit of carrying the knife is universal; and in\r\ntraversing a thick wood it is almost necessary, on account of the\r\ncreeping plants. The frequent occurrence of murder may be partly\r\nattributed to this habit. The Brazilians are so dexterous with the\r\nknife that they can throw it to some distance with precision, and with\r\nsufficient force to cause a fatal wound. I have seen a number of little\r\nboys practising this art as a game of play, and from their skill in\r\nhitting an upright stick, they promised well for more earnest attempts.\r\nMy companion, the day before, had shot two large bearded monkeys. These\r\nanimals have prehensile tails, the extremity of which, even after\r\ndeath, can support the whole weight of the body. One of them thus\r\nremained fast to a branch, and it was necessary to cut down a large\r\ntree to procure it. This was soon effected, and down came tree and\r\nmonkey with an awful crash. Our day’s sport, besides the monkey, was\r\nconfined to sundry small green parrots and a few toucans. I profited,\r\nhowever, by my acquaintance with the Portuguese padre, for on another\r\noccasion he gave me a fine specimen of the Yagouaroundi cat.\r\n\r\nEvery one has heard of the beauty of the scenery near Botofogo. The\r\nhouse in which I lived was seated close beneath the well-known mountain\r\nof the Corcovado. It has been remarked, with much truth, that abruptly\r\nconical hills are characteristic of\r\nthe formation which Humboldt designates as gneiss-granite. Nothing can\r\nbe more striking than the effect of these huge rounded masses of naked\r\nrock rising out of the most luxuriant vegetation.\r\n\r\nI was often interested by watching the clouds, which, rolling in from\r\nseaward, formed a bank just beneath the highest point of the Corcovado.\r\nThis mountain, like most others, when thus partly veiled, appeared to\r\nrise to a far prouder elevation than its real height of 2300 feet. Mr.\r\nDaniell has observed, in his meteorological essays, that a cloud\r\nsometimes appears fixed on a mountain summit, while the wind continues\r\nto blow over it. The same phenomenon here presented a slightly\r\ndifferent appearance. In this case the cloud was clearly seen to curl\r\nover, and rapidly pass by the summit, and yet was neither diminished\r\nnor increased in size. The sun was setting, and a gentle southerly\r\nbreeze, striking against the southern side of the rock, mingled its\r\ncurrent with the colder air above; and the vapour was thus condensed:\r\nbut as the light wreaths of cloud passed over the ridge, and came\r\nwithin the influence of the warmer atmosphere of the northern sloping\r\nbank, they were immediately redissolved.\r\n\r\nThe climate, during the months of May and June, or the beginning of\r\nwinter, was delightful. The mean temperature, from observations taken\r\nat nine o’clock, both morning and evening, was only 72°. It often\r\nrained heavily, but the drying southerly winds soon again rendered the\r\nwalks pleasant. One morning, in the course of six hours, 1.6 inches of\r\nrain fell. As this storm passed over the forests which surround the\r\nCorcovado, the sound produced by the drops pattering on the countless\r\nmultitude of leaves was very remarkable, it could be heard at the\r\ndistance of a quarter of a mile, and was like the rushing of a great\r\nbody of water. After the hotter days, it was delicious to sit quietly\r\nin the garden and watch the evening pass into night. Nature, in these\r\nclimes, chooses her vocalists from more humble performers than in\r\nEurope. A small frog, of the genus Hyla, sits on a blade of grass about\r\nan inch above the surface of the water, and sends forth a pleasing\r\nchirp: when several are together they sing in harmony on different\r\nnotes. I had some difficulty in catching a specimen of this frog. The\r\ngenus Hyla has its toes terminated by small suckers; and I found this\r\nanimal could crawl up a pane of glass, when placed\r\nabsolutely perpendicular. Various cicadæ and crickets, at the same\r\ntime, keep up a ceaseless shrill cry, but which, softened by the\r\ndistance, is not unpleasant. Every evening after dark this great\r\nconcert commenced; and often have I sat listening to it, until my\r\nattention has been drawn away by some curious passing insect.\r\n\r\nAt these times the fireflies are seen flitting about from hedge to\r\nhedge. On a dark night the light can be seen at about two hundred paces\r\ndistant. It is remarkable that in all the different kinds of glowworms,\r\nshining elaters, and various marine animals (such as the crustacea,\r\nmedusæ, nereidæ, a coralline of the genus Clytia, and Pyrosoma),\r\nwhich I have observed, the light has been of a well-marked green\r\ncolour. All the fireflies, which I caught here, belonged to the\r\nLampyridæ (in which family the English glowworm is included), and the\r\ngreater number of specimens were of Lampyris occidentalis.[4] I found\r\nthat this insect emitted the most brilliant flashes when irritated: in\r\nthe intervals, the abdominal rings were obscured. The flash was almost\r\ncoinstantaneous in the two rings, but it was just perceptible first in\r\nthe anterior one. The shining matter was fluid and very adhesive:\r\nlittle spots, where the skin had been torn, continued bright with a\r\nslight scintillation, whilst the uninjured parts were obscured. When\r\nthe insect was decapitated the rings remained uninterruptedly bright,\r\nbut not so brilliant as before: local irritation with a needle always\r\nincreased the vividness of the light. The rings in one instance\r\nretained their luminous property nearly twenty-four hours after the\r\ndeath of the insect. From these facts it would appear probable, that\r\nthe animal has only the power of concealing or extinguishing the light\r\nfor short intervals, and that at other times the display is\r\ninvoluntary. On the muddy and wet gravel-walks I found the larvæ of\r\nthis lampyris in great numbers: they resembled in general form the\r\nfemale of the English glowworm. These larvæ possessed but feeble\r\nluminous powers; very differently from their parents, on the slightest\r\ntouch they feigned death, and ceased to shine; nor did irritation\r\nexcite any fresh display. I kept several of them alive for some time:\r\ntheir tails are very singular organs, for they act, by a well-fitted\r\ncontrivance, as suckers or organs of attachment,\r\nand likewise as reservoirs for saliva, or some such fluid. I repeatedly\r\nfed them on raw meat; and I invariably observed, that every now and\r\nthen the extremity of the tail was applied to the mouth, and a drop of\r\nfluid exuded on the meat, which was then in the act of being consumed.\r\nThe tail, notwithstanding so much practice, does not seem to be able to\r\nfind its way to the mouth; at least the neck was always touched first,\r\nand apparently as a guide.\r\n\r\n [4] I am greatly indebted to Mr. Waterhouse for his kindness in naming\r\n for me this and many other insects, and giving me much valuable\r\n assistance.\r\n\r\nWhen we were at Bahia, an elater or beetle (Pyrophorus luminosus,\r\nIllig.) seemed the most common luminous insect. The light in this case\r\nwas also rendered more brilliant by irritation. I amused myself one day\r\nby observing the springing powers of this insect, which have not, as it\r\nappears to me, been properly described.[5] The elater, when placed on\r\nits back and preparing to spring, moved its head and thorax backwards,\r\nso that the pectoral spine was drawn out, and rested on the edge of its\r\nsheath. The same backward movement being continued, the spine, by the\r\nfull action of the muscles, was bent like a spring; and the insect at\r\nthis moment rested on the extremity of its head and wing-cases. The\r\neffort being suddenly relaxed, the head and thorax flew up, and in\r\nconsequence, the base of the wing-cases struck the supporting surface\r\nwith such force, that the insect by the reaction was jerked upwards to\r\nthe height of one or two inches. The projecting points of the thorax,\r\nand the sheath of the spine, served to steady the whole body during the\r\nspring. In the descriptions which I have read, sufficient stress does\r\nnot appear to have been laid on the elasticity of the spine: so sudden\r\na spring could not be the result of simple muscular contraction,\r\nwithout the aid of some mechanical contrivance.\r\n\r\n [5] Kirby’s _Entomology_, vol. ii, p. 317.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn several occasions I enjoyed some short but most pleasant excursions\r\nin the neighbouring country. One day I went to the Botanic Garden,\r\nwhere many plants, well known for their great utility, might be seen\r\ngrowing. The leaves of the camphor, pepper, cinnamon, and clove trees\r\nwere delightfully aromatic; and the bread-fruit, the jaca, and the\r\nmango, vied with each other in the magnificence of their foliage. The\r\nlandscape in the neighbourhood of Bahia almost takes its character\r\nfrom the two latter trees. Before seeing them, I had no idea that any\r\ntrees could cast so black a shade on the ground. Both of them bear to\r\nthe evergreen vegetation of these climates the same kind of relation\r\nwhich laurels and hollies in England do to the lighter green of the\r\ndeciduous trees. It may be observed that the houses within the tropics\r\nare surrounded by the most beautiful forms of vegetation, because many\r\nof them are at the same time most useful to man. Who can doubt that\r\nthese qualities are united in the banana, the cocoa-nut, the many kinds\r\nof palm, the orange, and the bread-fruit tree?\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nDuring this day I was particularly struck with a remark of Humboldt’s,\r\nwho often alludes to “the thin vapour which, without changing the\r\ntransparency of the air, renders its tints more harmonious, and softens\r\nits effects.” This is an appearance which I have never observed in the\r\ntemperate zones. The atmosphere, seen through a short space of half or\r\nthree-quarters of a mile, was perfectly lucid, but at a greater\r\ndistance all colours were blended into a most beautiful haze, of a pale\r\nFrench grey, mingled with a little blue. The condition of the\r\natmosphere between the morning and about noon, when the effect was most\r\nevident, had undergone little change, excepting in its dryness. In the\r\ninterval, the difference between the dew point and temperature had\r\nincreased from 7.5° to 17°.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion I started early and walked to the Gavia, or topsail\r\nmountain. The air was delightfully cool and fragrant; and the drops of\r\ndew still glittered on the leaves of the large liliaceous plants, which\r\nshaded the streamlets of clear water. Sitting down on a block of\r\ngranite, it was delightful to watch the various insects and birds as\r\nthey flew past. The humming-bird seems particularly fond of such shady\r\nretired spots. Whenever I saw these little creatures buzzing round a\r\nflower, with their wings vibrating so rapidly as to be scarcely\r\nvisible, I was reminded of the sphinx moths: their movements and habits\r\nare indeed in many respects very similar.\r\n\r\nFollowing a pathway I entered a noble forest, and from a height of five\r\nor six hundred feet, one of those splendid views was presented, which\r\nare so common on every side of Rio. At this elevation the landscape\r\nattains its most brilliant tint; and every form, every shade, so\r\ncompletely surpasses in magnificence all that the European has ever\r\nbeheld in his own country, that\r\nhe knows not how to express his feelings. The general effect frequently\r\nrecalled to my mind the gayest scenery of the Opera-house or the great\r\ntheatres. I never returned from these excursions empty-handed. This day\r\nI found a specimen of a curious fungus, called Hymenophallus. Most\r\npeople know the English Phallus, which in autumn taints the air with\r\nits odious smell: this, however, as the entomologist is aware, is to\r\nsome of our beetles a delightful fragrance. So was it here; for a\r\nStrongylus, attracted by the odour, alighted on the fungus as I carried\r\nit in my hand. We here see in two distant countries a similar relation\r\nbetween plants and insects of the same families, though the species of\r\nboth are different. When man is the agent in introducing into a country\r\na new species this relation is often broken: as one instance of this I\r\nmay mention that the leaves of the cabbages and lettuces, which in\r\nEngland afford food to such a multitude of slugs and caterpillars, in\r\nthe gardens near Rio are untouched.\r\n\r\nDuring our stay at Brazil I made a large collection of insects. A few\r\ngeneral observations on the comparative importance of the different\r\norders may be interesting to the English entomologist. The large and\r\nbrilliantly-coloured Lepidoptera bespeak the zone they inhabit, far\r\nmore plainly than any other race of animals. I allude only to the\r\nbutterflies; for the moths, contrary to what might have been expected\r\nfrom the rankness of the vegetation, certainly appeared in much fewer\r\nnumbers than in our own temperate regions. I was much surprised at the\r\nhabits of Papilio feronia. This butterfly is not uncommon, and\r\ngenerally frequents the orange-groves. Although a high flier, yet it\r\nvery frequently alights on the trunks of trees. On these occasions its\r\nhead is invariably placed downwards; and its wings are expanded in a\r\nhorizontal plane, instead of being folded vertically, as is commonly\r\nthe case. This is the only butterfly which I have ever seen that uses\r\nits legs for running. Not being aware of this fact, the insect, more\r\nthan once, as I cautiously approached with my forceps, shuffled on one\r\nside just as the instrument was on the point of closing, and thus\r\nescaped. But a far more singular fact is the power which this species\r\npossesses of making a noise.[6] Several times when a pair,\r\nprobably male and female, were chasing each other in an irregular\r\ncourse, they passed within a few yards of me; and I distinctly heard a\r\nclicking noise, similar to that produced by a toothed wheel passing\r\nunder a spring catch. The noise was continued at short intervals, and\r\ncould be distinguished at about twenty yards’ distance: I am certain\r\nthere is no error in the observation.\r\n\r\n [6] Mr. Doubleday has lately described (before the Entomological\r\n Society, March 3rd, 1845) a peculiar structure in the wings of this\r\n butterfly, which seems to be the means of its making its noise. He\r\n says, “It is remarkable for having a sort of drum at the base of the\r\n fore wings, between the costal nervure and the subcostal. These two\r\n nervures, moreover, have a peculiar screw-like diaphragm or vessel in\r\n the interior.” I find in Langsdorff’s travels (in the years 1803-7, p.\r\n 74) it is said, that in the island of St. Catherine’s on the coast of\r\n Brazil, a butterfly called Februa Hoffmanseggi, makes a noise, when\r\n flying away, like a rattle.\r\n\r\nI was disappointed in the general aspect of the Coleoptera. The number\r\nof minute and obscurely coloured beetles is exceedingly great.[7] The\r\ncabinets of Europe can, as yet, boast only of the larger species from\r\ntropical climates. It is sufficient to disturb the composure of an\r\nentomologist’s mind, to look forward to the future dimensions of a\r\ncomplete catalogue. The carnivorous beetles, or Carabidæ, appear in\r\nextremely few numbers within the tropics: this is the more remarkable\r\nwhen compared to the case of the carnivorous quadrupeds, which are so\r\nabundant in hot countries. I was struck with this observation both on\r\nentering Brazil, and when I saw the many elegant and active forms of\r\nthe Harpalidæ reappearing on the temperate plains of La Plata. Do the\r\nvery numerous spiders and rapacious Hymenoptera supply the place of the\r\ncarnivorous beetles? The carrion-feeders and Brachelytra are very\r\nuncommon; on the other hand, the Rhyncophora and Chrysomelidæ, all of\r\nwhich depend on the vegetable world for subsistence, are present in\r\nastonishing numbers. I do not here refer to the number of different\r\nspecies, but to that of the individual insects; for on this it is that\r\nthe most striking character in the entomology of different countries\r\ndepends. The orders Orthoptera and Hemiptera are particularly numerous;\r\nas likewise is the stinging division of the Hymenoptera; the bees,\r\nperhaps, being excepted. A person, on first entering a tropical\r\nforest, is astonished at the labours of the ants: well-beaten paths\r\nbranch off in every direction, on which an army of never-failing\r\nforagers may be seen, some going forth, and others returning, burdened\r\nwith pieces of green leaf, often larger than their own bodies.\r\n\r\n [7] I may mention, as a common instance of one day’s (June 23rd)\r\n collecting, when I was not attending particularly to the Coleoptera,\r\n that I caught sixty-eight species of that order. Among these, there\r\n were only two of the Carabidæ, four Brachelytra, fifteen Rhyncophora,\r\n and fourteen of the Chrysomelidæ. Thirty-seven species of Arachnidæ,\r\n which I brought home, will be sufficient to prove that I was not\r\n paying overmuch attention to the generally favoured order of\r\n Coleoptera.\r\n\r\nA small dark-coloured ant sometimes migrates in countless numbers. One\r\nday, at Bahia, my attention was drawn by observing many spiders,\r\ncockroaches, and other insects, and some lizards, rushing in the\r\ngreatest agitation across a bare piece of ground. A little way behind,\r\nevery stalk and leaf was blackened by a small ant. The swarm having\r\ncrossed the bare space, divided itself, and descended an old wall. By\r\nthis means many insects were fairly enclosed; and the efforts which the\r\npoor little creatures made to extricate themselves from such a death\r\nwere wonderful. When the ants came to the road they changed their\r\ncourse, and in narrow files reascended the wall. Having placed a small\r\nstone so as to intercept one of the lines, the whole body attacked it,\r\nand then immediately retired. Shortly afterwards another body came to\r\nthe charge, and again having failed to make any impression, this line\r\nof march was entirely given up. By going an inch round, the file might\r\nhave avoided the stone, and this doubtless would have happened, if it\r\nhad been originally there: but having been attacked, the lion-hearted\r\nlittle warriors scorned the idea of yielding.\r\n\r\nCertain wasp-like insects, which construct in the corners of the\r\nverandahs clay cells for their larvæ, are very numerous in the\r\nneighbourhood of Rio. These cells they stuff full of half-dead spiders\r\nand caterpillars, which they seem wonderfully to know how to sting to\r\nthat degree as to leave them paralysed but alive, until their eggs are\r\nhatched; and the larvae feed on the horrid mass of powerless,\r\nhalf-killed victims—a sight which has been described by an enthusiastic\r\nnaturalist[8] as curious and pleasing! I was much interested one day by\r\nwatching a deadly contest between a Pepsis and a large spider of the\r\ngenus Lycosa. The wasp made a sudden dash at its prey, and then flew\r\naway: the spider was evidently wounded, for, trying to escape, it\r\nrolled down a little slope, but had still strength\r\nsufficient to crawl into a thick tuft of grass. The wasp soon returned,\r\nand seemed surprised at not immediately finding its victim. It then\r\ncommenced as regular a hunt as ever hound did after fox; making short\r\nsemicircular casts, and all the time rapidly vibrating its wings and\r\nantennæ. The spider, though well concealed, was soon discovered, and\r\nthe wasp, evidently still afraid of its adversary’s jaws, after much\r\nmanœuvring, inflicted two stings on the under side of its thorax. At\r\nlast, carefully examining with its antennæ the now motionless spider,\r\nit proceeded to drag away the body. But I stopped both tyrant and\r\nprey.[9]\r\n\r\n [8] In a Manuscript in the British Museum by Mr. Abbott, who made his\r\n observations in Georgia; see Mr. A. White’s paper in the _Annals of\r\n Natural History_, vol. vii, p. 472. Lieutenant Hutton has described a\r\n sphex with similar habits in India, in the _Journal of the Asiatic\r\n Society_, vol. i, p. 555.\r\n\r\n\r\n [9] Don Felix Azara (vol. i, p. 175), mentioning a hymenopterous\r\n insect, probably of the same genus, says he saw it dragging a dead\r\n spider through tall grass, in a straight line to its nest, which was\r\n one hundred and sixty-three paces distant. He adds that the wasp, in\r\n order to find the road, every now and then made “demi-tours d’environ\r\n trois palmes.”\r\n\r\nThe number of spiders, in proportion to other insects, is here compared\r\nwith England very much larger; perhaps more so than with any other\r\ndivision of the articulate animals. The variety of species among the\r\njumping spiders appears almost infinite. The genus, or rather family of\r\nEpeira, is here characterized by many singular forms; some species have\r\npointed coriaceous shells, others enlarged and spiny tibiæ. Every path\r\nin the forest is barricaded with the strong yellow web of a species,\r\nbelonging to the same division with the Epeira clavipes of Fabricius,\r\nwhich was formerly said by Sloane to make, in the West Indies, webs so\r\nstrong as to catch birds. A small and pretty kind of spider, with very\r\nlong fore-legs, and which appears to belong to an undescribed genus,\r\nlives as a parasite on almost every one of these webs. I suppose it is\r\ntoo insignificant to be noticed by the great Epeira, and is therefore\r\nallowed to prey on the minute insects, which, adhering to the lines,\r\nwould otherwise be wasted. When frightened, this little spider either\r\nfeigns death by extending its front legs, or suddenly drops from the\r\nweb. A large Epeira of the same division with Epeira tuberculata and\r\nconica is extremely common, especially in dry situations. Its web,\r\nwhich is generally placed among the great leaves of the common agave,\r\nis sometimes strengthened near the centre by a pair or even four zigzag\r\nribbons, which connect two adjoining rays. When any large insect, as a\r\ngrasshopper or wasp, is caught, the spider, by a dexterous movement,\r\nmakes it revolve\r\nvery rapidly, and at the same time emitting a band of threads from its\r\nspinners, soon envelops its prey in a case like the cocoon of a\r\nsilkworm. The spider now examines the powerless victim, and gives the\r\nfatal bite on the hinder part of its thorax; then retreating, patiently\r\nwaits till the poison has taken effect. The virulence of this poison\r\nmay be judged of from the fact that in half a minute I opened the mesh,\r\nand found a large wasp quite lifeless. This Epeira always stands with\r\nits head downwards near the centre of the web. When disturbed, it acts\r\ndifferently according to circumstances: if there is a thicket below, it\r\nsuddenly falls down; and I have distinctly seen the thread from the\r\nspinners lengthened by the animal while yet stationary, as preparatory\r\nto its fall. If the ground is clear beneath, the Epeira seldom falls,\r\nbut moves quickly through a central passage from one to the other side.\r\nWhen still further disturbed, it practises a most curious manœuvre:\r\nstanding in the middle, it violently jerks the web, which is attached\r\nto elastic twigs, till at last the whole acquires such a rapid\r\nvibratory movement, that even the outline of the spider’s body becomes\r\nindistinct.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that most of the British spiders, when a large insect\r\nis caught in their webs, endeavour to cut the lines and liberate their\r\nprey, to save their nets from being entirely spoiled. I once, however,\r\nsaw in a hot-house in Shropshire a large female wasp caught in the\r\nirregular web of a quite small spider; and this spider, instead of\r\ncutting the web, most perseveringly continued to entangle the body, and\r\nespecially the wings, of its prey. The wasp at first aimed in vain\r\nrepeated thrusts with its sting at its little antagonist. Pitying the\r\nwasp, after allowing it to struggle for more than an hour, I killed it\r\nand put it back into the web. The spider soon returned; and an hour\r\nafterwards I was much surprised to find it with its jaws buried in the\r\norifice through which the sting is protruded by the living wasp. I\r\ndrove the spider away two or three times, but for the next twenty-four\r\nhours I always found it again sucking at the same place. The spider\r\nbecame much distended by the juices of its prey, which was many times\r\nlarger than itself.\r\n\r\nI may here just mention, that I found, near St. Fé Bajada, many large\r\nblack spiders, with ruby-coloured marks on their backs, having\r\ngregarious habits. The webs were placed\r\nvertically, as is invariably the case with the genus Epeira: they were\r\nseparated from each other by a space of about two feet, but were all\r\nattached to certain common lines, which were of great length, and\r\nextended to all parts of the community. In this manner the tops of some\r\nlarge bushes were encompassed by the united nets. Azara[10] has\r\ndescribed a gregarious spider in Paraguay, which Walckanaer thinks must\r\nbe a Theridion, but probably it is an Epeira, and perhaps even the same\r\nspecies with mine. I cannot, however, recollect seeing a central nest\r\nas large as a hat, in which, during autumn, when the spiders die, Azara\r\nsays the eggs are deposited. As all the spiders which I saw were of the\r\nsame size, they must have been nearly of the same age. This gregarious\r\nhabit, in so typical a genus as Epeira, among insects, which are so\r\nbloodthirsty and solitary that even the two sexes attack each other, is\r\na very singular fact.\r\n\r\n [10] Azara’s _Voyage_, vol. 1, p. 213.\r\n\r\nIn a lofty valley of the Cordillera, near Mendoza, I found another\r\nspider with a singularly-formed web. Strong lines radiated in a\r\nvertical plane from a common centre, where the insect had its station;\r\nbut only two of the rays were connected by a symmetrical mesh-work; so\r\nthat the net, instead of being, as is generally the case, circular,\r\nconsisted of a wedge-shaped segment. All the webs were similarly\r\nconstructed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter III\r\n\r\n\r\nMonte Video—Maldonado—Excursion to R.

In our passage to the Plata, we\r\nsaw nothing particular, excepting on one day a great shoal of\r\nporpoises, many hundreds in number. The whole sea was in places\r\nfurrowed by them; and a most extraordinary spectacle was presented, as\r\nhundreds, proceeding together by jumps, in which their whole bodies\r\nwere exposed, thus cut the water. When the ship was running nine knots\r\nan hour, these animals could cross and recross the bows with the\r\ngreatest ease, and then dash away right ahead. As soon as we entered\r\nthe estuary of the Plata, the weather was very unsettled. One dark\r\nnight we were surrounded by numerous seals and penguins, which made\r\nsuch strange noises, that the officer on watch reported he could hear\r\nthe cattle bellowing on shore. On a second night we witnessed a\r\nsplendid scene of natural fireworks; the mast-head and yard-arm ends\r\nshone with St. Elmo’s light; and the form of the vane could almost be\r\ntraced, as if it had been rubbed with phosphorus. The sea was so highly\r\nluminous, that the tracks of the penguins were marked by a fiery wake,\r\nand the darkness of the sky was momentarily illuminated by the most\r\nvivid lightning.\r\n\r\nWhen within the mouth of the river, I was interested by observing how\r\nslowly the waters of the sea and river mixed. The latter, muddy and\r\ndiscoloured, from its less specific gravity, floated on the surface of\r\nthe salt water. This was curiously exhibited in the wake of the vessel,\r\nwhere a line of blue water was seen mingling in little eddies with the\r\nadjoining fluid.\r\n\r\n_July_ 26_th_, 1832.—We anchored at Monte Video. The _Beagle_ was\r\nemployed in surveying the extreme southern and eastern coasts of\r\nAmerica, south of the Plata, during the two succeeding years. To\r\nprevent useless repetitions, I will extract those parts of my journal\r\nwhich refer to the same districts, without always attending to the\r\norder in which we visited them.\r\n\r\nMALDONADO is situated on the northern bank of the Plata, and not very\r\nfar from the mouth of the estuary. It is a most quiet, forlorn, little\r\ntown; built, as is universally the case in these countries, with the\r\nstreets running at right angles to each other, and having in the middle\r\na large plaza or square, which, from its size, renders the scantiness\r\nof the population more evident. It possesses scarcely any trade; the\r\nexports being confined to a few hides and living cattle. The\r\ninhabitants are chiefly landowners, together with a few shopkeepers and\r\nthe necessary tradesmen, such as blacksmiths and carpenters, who do\r\nnearly all the business for a circuit of fifty miles round. The town is\r\nseparated from the river by a band of sand-hillocks, about a mile\r\nbroad: it is surrounded on all other sides by an\r\nopen slightly-undulating country, covered by one uniform layer of fine\r\ngreen turf, on which countless herds of cattle, sheep, and horses\r\ngraze. There is very little land cultivated even close to the town. A\r\nfew hedges made of cacti and agave mark out where some wheat or Indian\r\ncorn has been planted. The features of the country are very similar\r\nalong the whole northern bank of the Plata. The only difference is,\r\nthat here the granitic hills are a little bolder. The scenery is very\r\nuninteresting; there is scarcely a house, an enclosed piece of ground,\r\nor even a tree, to give it an air of cheerfulness. Yet, after being\r\nimprisoned for some time in a ship, there is a charm in the unconfined\r\nfeeling of walking over boundless plains of turf. Moreover, if your\r\nview is limited to a small space, many objects possess beauty. Some of\r\nthe smaller birds are brilliantly coloured; and the bright green sward,\r\nbrowsed short by the cattle, is ornamented by dwarf flowers, among\r\nwhich a plant, looking like the daisy, claimed the place of an old\r\nfriend. What would a florist say to whole tracts, so thickly covered by\r\nthe Verbena melindres, as, even at a distance, to appear of the most\r\ngaudy scarlet?\r\n\r\nI stayed ten weeks at Maldonado, in which time a nearly perfect\r\ncollection of the animals, birds, and reptiles, was procured. Before\r\nmaking any observations respecting them, I will give an account of a\r\nlittle excursion I made as far as the river Polanco, which is about\r\nseventy miles distant, in a northerly direction. I may mention, as a\r\nproof how cheap everything is in this country, that I paid only two\r\ndollars a day or eight shillings, for two men, together with a troop of\r\nabout a dozen riding-horses. My companions were well armed with pistols\r\nand sabres; a precaution which I thought rather unnecessary; but the\r\nfirst piece of news we heard was, that, the day before, a traveller\r\nfrom Monte Video had been found dead on the road, with his throat cut.\r\nThis happened close to a cross, the record of a former murder.\r\n\r\nOn the first night we slept at a retired little country-house; and\r\nthere I soon found out that I possessed two or three articles,\r\nespecially a pocket compass, which created unbounded astonishment. In\r\nevery house I was asked to show the compass, and by its aid, together\r\nwith a map, to point out the direction\r\nof various places. It excited the liveliest admiration that I, a\r\nperfect stranger, should know the road (for direction and road are\r\nsynonymous in this open country) to places where I had never been. At\r\none house a young woman who was ill in bed, sent to entreat me to come\r\nand show her the compass. If their surprise was great, mine was\r\ngreater, to find such ignorance among people who possessed their\r\nthousands of cattle, and “estancias” of great extent. It can only be\r\naccounted for by the circumstance that this retired part of the country\r\nis seldom visited by foreigners. I was asked whether the earth or sun\r\nmoved; whether it was hotter or colder to the north; where Spain was,\r\nand many other such questions. The greater number of the inhabitants\r\nhad an indistinct idea that England, London, and North America, were\r\ndifferent names for the same place; but the better informed well knew\r\nthat London and North America were separate countries close together,\r\nand that England was a large town in London! I carried with me some\r\npromethean matches, which I ignited by biting; it was thought so\r\nwonderful that a man should strike fire with his teeth, that it was\r\nusual to collect the whole family to see it: I was once offered a\r\ndollar for a single one. Washing my face in the morning caused much\r\nspeculation at the village of Las Minas; a superior tradesman closely\r\ncross-questioned me about so singular a practice; and likewise why on\r\nboard we wore our beards; for he had heard from my guide that we did\r\nso. He eyed me with much suspicion; perhaps he had heard of ablutions\r\nin the Mahomedan religion, and knowing me to be a heretic, probably he\r\ncame to the conclusion that all heretics were Turks. It is the general\r\ncustom in this country to ask for a night’s lodging at the first\r\nconvenient house. The astonishment at the compass, and my other feats\r\nof jugglery, was to a certain degree advantageous, as with that, and\r\nthe long stories my guides told of my breaking stones, knowing venomous\r\nfrom harmless snakes, collecting insects, etc., I repaid them for their\r\nhospitality. I am writing as if I had been among the inhabitants of\r\nCentral Africa: Banda Oriental would not be flattered by the\r\ncomparison; but such were my feelings at the time.\r\n\r\nThe next day we rode to the village of Las Minas. The country was\r\nrather more hilly, but otherwise continued the\r\nsame; an inhabitant of the Pampas no doubt would have considered it as\r\ntruly alpine. The country is so thinly inhabited, that during the whole\r\nday we scarcely met a single person. Las Minas is much smaller even\r\nthan Maldonado. It is seated on a little plain, and is surrounded by\r\nlow rocky mountains. It is of the usual symmetrical form, and with its\r\nwhitewashed church standing in the centre, had rather a pretty\r\nappearance. The outskirting houses rose out of the plain like isolated\r\nbeings, without the accompaniment of gardens or courtyards. This is\r\ngenerally the case in the country, and all the houses have, in\r\nconsequence, an uncomfortable aspect. At night we stopped at a\r\npulperia, or drinking-shop. During the evening a great number of\r\nGauchos came in to drink spirits and smoke cigars: their appearance is\r\nvery striking; they are generally tall and handsome, but with a proud\r\nand dissolute expression of countenance. They frequently wear their\r\nmoustaches, and long black hair curling down their backs. With their\r\nbrightly coloured garments, great spurs clanking about their heels, and\r\nknives stuck as daggers (and often so used) at their waists, they look\r\na very different race of men from what might be expected from their\r\nname of Gauchos, or simple countrymen. Their politeness is excessive;\r\nthey never drink their spirits without expecting you to taste it; but\r\nwhilst making their exceedingly graceful bow, they seem quite as ready,\r\nif occasion offered, to cut your throat.\r\n\r\nOn the third day we pursued rather an irregular course, as I was\r\nemployed in examining some beds of marble. On the fine plains of turf\r\nwe saw many ostriches (Struthio rhea). Some of the flocks contained as\r\nmany as twenty or thirty birds. These, when standing on any little\r\neminence, and seen against the clear sky, presented a very noble\r\nappearance. I never met with such tame ostriches in any other part of\r\nthe country: it was easy to gallop up within a short distance of them;\r\nbut then, expanding their wings, they made all sail right before the\r\nwind, and soon left the horse astern.\r\n\r\nAt night we came to the house of Don Juan Fuentes, a rich landed\r\nproprietor, but not personally known to either of my companions. On\r\napproaching the house of a stranger, it is usual to follow several\r\nlittle points of etiquette: riding up slowly to the door, the\r\nsalutation of Ave Maria is given, and\r\nuntil somebody comes out and asks you to alight, it is not customary\r\neven to get off your horse: the formal answer of the owner is, “sin\r\npecado concebida”—that is, conceived without sin. Having entered the\r\nhouse, some general conversation is kept up for a few minutes, till\r\npermission is asked to pass the night there. This is granted as a\r\nmatter of course. The stranger then takes his meals with the family,\r\nand a room is assigned him, where with the horsecloths belonging to his\r\nrecado (or saddle of the Pampas) he makes his bed. It is curious how\r\nsimilar circumstances produce such similar results in manners. At the\r\nCape of Good Hope the same hospitality, and very nearly the same points\r\nof etiquette, are universally observed. The difference, however,\r\nbetween the character of the Spaniard and that of the Dutch boor is\r\nshown, by the former never asking his guest a single question beyond\r\nthe strictest rule of politeness, whilst the honest Dutchman demands\r\nwhere he has been, where he is going, what is his business, and even\r\nhow many brothers, sisters, or children he may happen to have.\r\n\r\nShortly after our arrival at Don Juan’s one of the largest herds of\r\ncattle was driven in towards the house, and three beasts were picked\r\nout to be slaughtered for the supply of the establishment. These\r\nhalf-wild cattle are very active; and knowing full well the fatal lazo,\r\nthey led the horses a long and laborious chase. After witnessing the\r\nrude wealth displayed in the number of cattle, men, and horses, Don\r\nJuan’s miserable house was quite curious. The floor consisted of\r\nhardened mud, and the windows were without glass; the sitting-room\r\nboasted only of a few of the roughest chairs and stools, with a couple\r\nof tables. The supper, although several strangers were present,\r\nconsisted of two huge piles, one of roast beef, the other of boiled,\r\nwith some pieces of pumpkin: besides this latter there was no other\r\nvegetable, and not even a morsel of bread. For drinking, a large\r\nearthenware jug of water served the whole party. Yet this man was the\r\nowner of several square miles of land, of which nearly every acre would\r\nproduce corn, and, with a little trouble, all the common vegetables.\r\nThe evening was spent in smoking, with a little impromptu singing,\r\naccompanied by the guitar. The signoritas all sat together in one\r\ncorner of the room, and did not sup with the men.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nSo many works have been written about these countries,\r\nthat it is almost superfluous to describe either the lazo or the bolas.\r\nThe lazo consists of a very strong, but thin, well-plaited rope, made\r\nof raw hide. One end is attached to the broad surcingle, which fastens\r\ntogether the complicated gear of the recado, or saddle used in the\r\nPampas; the other is terminated by a small ring of iron or brass, by\r\nwhich a noose can be formed. The Gaucho, when he is going to use the\r\nlazo, keeps a small coil in his bridle-hand, and in the other holds the\r\nrunning noose, which is made very large, generally having a diameter of\r\nabout eight feet. This he whirls round his head, and by the dexterous\r\nmovement of his wrist keeps the noose open; then, throwing it, he\r\ncauses it to fall on any particular spot he chooses. The lazo, when not\r\nused, is tied up in a small coil to the after part of the recado. The\r\nbolas, or balls, are of two kinds: the simplest, which is chiefly used\r\nfor catching ostriches, consists of two round stones, covered with\r\nleather, and united by a thin plaited thong, about eight feet long. The\r\nother kind differs only in having three balls united by the thongs to a\r\ncommon centre. The Gaucho holds the smallest of the three in his hand,\r\nand whirls the other two round and round his head; then, taking aim,\r\nsends them like chain shot revolving through the air. The balls no\r\nsooner strike any object, than, winding round it, they cross each\r\nother, and become firmly hitched. The size and weight of the balls\r\nvaries, according to the purpose for which they are made: when of\r\nstone, although not larger than an apple, they are sent with such force\r\nas sometimes to break the leg even of a horse. I have seen the balls\r\nmade of wood, and as large as a turnip, for the sake of catching these\r\nanimals without injuring them. The balls are sometimes made of iron,\r\nand these can be hurled to\r\nthe greatest distance. The main difficulty in using either lazo or\r\nbolas is to ride so well as to be able at full speed, and while\r\nsuddenly turning about, to whirl them so steadily round the head, as to\r\ntake aim: on foot any person would soon learn the art. One day, as I\r\nwas amusing myself by galloping and whirling the balls round my head,\r\nby accident the free one struck a bush, and its revolving motion being\r\nthus destroyed, it immediately fell to the ground, and, like magic\r\ncaught one hind leg of my horse; the other ball was then jerked out of\r\nmy hand, and the horse fairly secured. Luckily he was an old practised\r\nanimal, and knew what it meant; otherwise he would probably have kicked\r\ntill he had thrown himself down. The Gauchos roared with laughter; they\r\ncried out that they had seen every sort of animal caught, but had never\r\nbefore seen a man caught by himself.\r\n\r\nDuring the two succeeding days, I reached the farthest point which I\r\nwas anxious to examine. The country wore the same aspect, till at last\r\nthe fine green turf became more wearisome than a dusty turnpike road.\r\nWe everywhere saw great numbers of partridges (Nothura major). These\r\nbirds do not go in coveys, nor do they conceal themselves like the\r\nEnglish kind. It appears a very silly bird. A man on horseback by\r\nriding round and round in a circle, or rather in a spire, so as to\r\napproach closer each time, may knock on the head as many as he pleases.\r\nThe more common method is to catch them with a running noose, or little\r\nlazo, made of the stem of an ostrich’s feather, fastened to the end of\r\na long stick. A boy on a quiet old horse will frequently thus catch\r\nthirty or forty in a day. In Arctic North America[1] the Indians catch\r\nthe Varying Hare by walking spirally round and round it, when on its\r\nform: the middle of the day is reckoned the best time, when the sun is\r\nhigh, and the shadow of the hunter not very long.\r\n\r\n [1] Hearne’s _Journey_, p. 383.\r\n\r\nOn our return to Maldonado, we followed rather a different line of\r\nroad. Near Pan de Azucar, a landmark well known to all those who have\r\nsailed up the Plata, I stayed a day at the house of a most hospitable\r\nold Spaniard. Early in the morning we ascended the Sierra de las\r\nAnimas. By the aid of the rising sun the scenery was almost\r\npicturesque. To the westward\r\nthe view extended over an immense level plain as far as the Mount, at\r\nMonte Video, and to the eastward, over the mammillated country of\r\nMaldonado. On the summit of the mountain there were several small heaps\r\nof stones, which evidently had lain there for many years. My companion\r\nassured me that they were the work of the Indians in the old time. The\r\nheaps were similar, but on a much smaller scale, to those so commonly\r\nfound on the mountains of Wales. The desire to signalise any event, on\r\nthe highest point of the neighbouring land, seems a universal passion\r\nwith mankind. At the present day, not a single Indian, either civilised\r\nor wild, exists in this part of the province; nor am I aware that the\r\nformer inhabitants have left behind them any more permanent records\r\nthan these insignificant piles on the summit of the Sierra de las\r\nAnimas.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe general, and almost entire absence of trees in Banda Oriental is\r\nremarkable. Some of the rocky hills are partly covered by thickets, and\r\non the banks of the larger streams, especially to the north of Las\r\nMinas, willow-trees are not uncommon. Near the Arroyo Tapes I heard of\r\na wood of palms; and one of these trees, of considerable size, I saw\r\nnear the Pan de Azucar, in lat. 35°. These, and the trees planted by\r\nthe Spaniards, offer the only exceptions to the general scarcity of\r\nwood. Among the introduced kinds may be enumerated poplars, olives,\r\npeach, and other fruit trees: the peaches succeed so well, that they\r\nafford the main supply of firewood to the city of Buenos Ayres.\r\nExtremely level countries, such as the Pampas, seldom appear favourable\r\nto the growth of trees. This may possibly be attributed either to the\r\nforce of the winds, or the kind of drainage. In the nature of the land,\r\nhowever, around Maldonado, no such reason is apparent; the rocky\r\nmountains afford protected situations; enjoying various kinds of soil;\r\nstreamlets of water are common at the bottoms of nearly every valley;\r\nand the clayey nature of the earth seems adapted to retain moisture. It\r\nhas been inferred, with much probability, that the presence of woodland\r\nis generally determined[2] by the annual amount of moisture; yet in\r\nthis province abundant and heavy rain falls during the winter; and the\r\nsummer, though\r\ndry, is not so in any excessive degree.[3] We see nearly the whole of\r\nAustralia covered by lofty trees, yet that country possesses a far more\r\narid climate. Hence we must look to some other and unknown cause.\r\n\r\n [2] Maclaren, article “America,” _Encyclopedia Britannica._\r\n\r\n\r\n [3] Azara says “Je crois que la quantité annuelle des pluies est, dans\r\n toutes ces contrées, plus considérable qu’en Espagne.”—Vol. i, p. 36.\r\n\r\nConfining our view to South America, we should certainly be tempted to\r\nbelieve that trees flourished only under a very humid climate; for the\r\nlimit of the forest-land follows, in a most remarkable manner, that of\r\nthe damp winds. In the southern part of the continent, where the\r\nwestern gales, charged with moisture from the Pacific, prevail, every\r\nisland on the broken west coast, from lat. 38° to the extreme point of\r\nTierra del Fuego, is densely covered by impenetrable forests. On the\r\neastern side of the Cordillera, over the same extent of latitude, where\r\na blue sky and a fine climate prove that the atmosphere has been\r\ndeprived of its moisture by passing over the mountains, the arid plains\r\nof Patagonia support a most scanty vegetation. In the more northern\r\nparts of the continent, within the limits of the constant south-eastern\r\ntrade-wind, the eastern side is ornamented by magnificent forests;\r\nwhilst the western coast, from lat. 4° S. to lat. 32° S., may be\r\ndescribed as a desert; on this western coast, northward of lat. 4° S.,\r\nwhere the trade-wind loses its regularity, and heavy torrents of rain\r\nfall periodically, the shores of the Pacific, so utterly desert in\r\nPeru, assume near Cape Blanco the character of luxuriance so celebrated\r\nat Guayaquil and Panama. Hence in the southern and northern parts of\r\nthe continent, the forest and desert lands occupy reversed positions\r\nwith respect to the Cordillera, and these positions are apparently\r\ndetermined by the direction of the prevalent winds. In the middle of\r\nthe continent there is a broad intermediate band, including central\r\nChile and the provinces of La Plata, where the rain-bringing winds have\r\nnot to pass over lofty mountains, and where the land is neither a\r\ndesert nor covered by forests. But even the rule, if confined to South\r\nAmerica, of trees flourishing only in a climate rendered humid by\r\nrain-bearing winds, has a strongly marked exception in the case of the\r\nFalkland Islands. These islands, situated in the same latitude with\r\nTierra del Fuego and only between two and three hundred miles distant\r\nfrom it, having a nearly similar\r\nclimate, with a geological formation almost identical, with favourable\r\nsituations and the same kind of peaty soil, yet can boast of few plants\r\ndeserving even the title of bushes; whilst in Tierra del Fuego it is\r\nimpossible to find an acre of land not covered by the densest forest.\r\nIn this case, both the direction of the heavy gales of wind and of the\r\ncurrents of the sea are favourable to the transport of seeds from\r\nTierra del Fuego, as is shown by the canoes and trunks of trees drifted\r\nfrom that country, and frequently thrown on the shores of the Western\r\nFalkland. Hence perhaps it is, that there are many plants in common to\r\nthe two countries: but with respect to the trees of Tierra del Fuego,\r\neven attempts made to transplant them have failed.\r\n\r\nDuring our stay at Maldonado I collected several quadrupeds, eighty\r\nkinds of birds, and many reptiles, including nine species of snakes. Of\r\nthe indigenous mammalia, the only one now left of any size, which is\r\ncommon, is the Cervus campestris. This deer is exceedingly abundant,\r\noften in small herds, throughout the countries bordering the Plata and\r\nin Northern Patagonia. If a person crawling close along the ground,\r\nslowly advances towards a herd, the deer frequently, out of curiosity,\r\napproach to reconnoitre him. I have by this means, killed from one\r\nspot, three out of the same herd. Although so tame and inquisitive, yet\r\nwhen approached on horseback, they are exceedingly wary. In this\r\ncountry nobody goes on foot, and the deer knows man as its enemy only\r\nwhen he is mounted and armed with the bolas. At Bahia Blanca, a recent\r\nestablishment in Northern Patagonia, I was surprised to find how little\r\nthe deer cared for the noise of a gun: one day I fired ten times from\r\nwithin eighty yards at one animal; and it was much more startled at the\r\nball cutting up the ground than at the report of the rifle. My powder\r\nbeing exhausted, I was obliged to get up (to my shame as a sportsman be\r\nit spoken, though well able to kill birds on the wing) and halloo till\r\nthe deer ran away.\r\n\r\nThe most curious fact with respect to this animal, is the\r\noverpoweringly strong and offensive odour which proceeds from the buck.\r\nIt is quite indescribable: several times whilst skinning the specimen\r\nwhich is now mounted at the Zoological Museum, I was almost overcome by\r\nnausea. I tied up the\r\nskin in a silk pocket-handkerchief, and so carried it home: this\r\nhandkerchief, after being well washed, I continually used, and it was\r\nof course as repeatedly washed; yet every time, for a space of one year\r\nand seven months, when first unfolded, I distinctly perceived the\r\nodour. This appears an astonishing instance of the permanence of some\r\nmatter, which nevertheless in its nature must be most subtile and\r\nvolatile. Frequently, when passing at the distance of half a mile to\r\nleeward of a herd, I have perceived the whole air tainted with the\r\neffluvium. I believe the smell from the buck is most powerful at the\r\nperiod when its horns are perfect, or free from the hairy skin. When in\r\nthis state the meat is, of course, quite uneatable; but the Gauchos\r\nassert, that if buried for some time in fresh earth, the taint is\r\nremoved. I have somewhere read that the islanders in the north of\r\nScotland treat the rank carcasses of the fish-eating birds in the same\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nThe order Rodentia is here very numerous in species: of mice alone I\r\nobtained no less than eight kinds.[4] The largest gnawing animal in the\r\nworld, the Hydrochærus capybara (the water-hog), is here also common.\r\nOne which I shot at Monte Video weighed ninety-eight pounds: its\r\nlength, from the end of the snout to the stump-like tail, was three\r\nfeet two inches; and its girth three feet eight. These great Rodents\r\noccasionally frequent the islands in the mouth of the Plata, where the\r\nwater is quite salt, but are far more abundant on the borders of\r\nfresh-water lakes and rivers. Near Maldonado three or four generally\r\nlive together. In the daytime they either lie among the aquatic plants,\r\nor openly feed on the turf plain.[5] When viewed at a distance, from\r\ntheir manner of walking and colour they resemble pigs: but when seated\r\non their haunches, and attentively watching any object with one eye,\r\nthey reassume the appearance of their congeners, cavies and rabbits.\r\nBoth the front and side view of their head has quite a ludicrous\r\naspect, from the great depth of their jaw. These animals, at Maldonado,\r\nwere very tame; by cautiously walking, I approached within three yards\r\nof four old ones. This tameness may probably be accounted for, by the\r\nJaguar having been banished for some years, and by the Gaucho not\r\nthinking it worth his while to hunt them. As I approached nearer and\r\nnearer they frequently made their peculiar noise, which is a low abrupt\r\ngrunt, not having much actual sound, but rather arising from the sudden\r\nexpulsion of air: the only noise I know at all like it, is the first\r\nhoarse bark of a large dog. Having watched the four from almost within\r\narm’s length (and they me) for several minutes, they rushed into the\r\nwater at full gallop with the greatest impetuosity, and emitted at the\r\nsame time their bark. After diving a short distance they came again to\r\nthe surface, but only just showed the upper part of their heads. When\r\nthe female is swimming in the water, and has young ones, they are said\r\nto sit on her back. These animals are easily killed in numbers; but\r\ntheir skins are of trifling value, and the meat is very indifferent. On\r\nthe islands in the Rio Parana they are exceedingly abundant, and afford\r\nthe ordinary prey to the Jaguar.\r\n\r\n [4] In South America I collected altogether twenty-seven species of\r\n mice, and thirteen more are known from the works of Azara and other\r\n authors. Those collected by myself have been named and described by\r\n Mr. Waterhouse at the meetings of the Zoological Society. I must be\r\n allowed to take this opportunity of returning my cordial thanks to Mr.\r\n Waterhouse, and to the other gentleman attached to that Society, for\r\n their kind and most liberal assistance on all occasions.\r\n\r\n\r\n [5] In the stomach and duodenum of a capybara which I opened, I found\r\n a very large quantity of a thin yellowish fluid, in which scarcely a\r\n fibre could be distinguished. Mr. Owen informs me that a part of the\r\n œsophagus is so constructed that nothing much larger than a crowquill\r\n can be passed down. Certainly the broad teeth and strong jaws of this\r\n animal are well fitted to grind into pulp the aquatic plants on which\r\n it feeds.\r\n\r\nThe Tucutuco (Ctenomys Brasiliensis) is a curious small animal, which\r\nmay be briefly described as a Gnawer, with the habits of a mole. It is\r\nextremely numerous in some parts of the country, but it is difficult to\r\nbe procured, and never, I believe, comes out of the ground. It throws\r\nup at the mouth of its burrows hillocks of earth like those of the\r\nmole, but smaller. Considerable tracts of country are so completely\r\nundermined by these animals that horses, in passing over, sink above\r\ntheir fetlocks. The tucutucos appear, to a certain degree, to be\r\ngregarious: the man who procured the specimens for me had caught six\r\ntogether, and he said this was a common occurrence. They are nocturnal\r\nin their habits; and their principal food is the roots of plants, which\r\nare the object of their extensive and superficial burrows. This animal\r\nis universally known by a very peculiar noise which it makes when\r\nbeneath the ground. A person, the first time he hears it, is much\r\nsurprised; for it is not easy to tell whence it comes, nor is it\r\npossible to guess what\r\nkind of creature utters it. The noise consists in a short, but not\r\nrough, nasal grunt, which is monotonously repeated about four times in\r\nquick succession:[6] the name Tucutuco is given in imitation of the\r\nsound. Where this animal is abundant, it may be heard at all times of\r\nthe day, and sometimes directly beneath one’s feet. When kept in a\r\nroom, the tucutucos move both slowly and clumsily, which appears owing\r\nto the outward action of their hind legs; and they are quite incapable,\r\nfrom the socket of the thigh-bone not having a certain ligament, of\r\njumping even the smallest vertical height. They are very stupid in\r\nmaking any attempt to escape; when angry or frightened they utter the\r\ntucu-tuco. Of those I kept alive, several, even the first day, became\r\nquite tame, not attempting to bite or to run away; others were a little\r\nwilder.\r\n\r\n [6] At the R. Negro, in Northern Patagonia, there is an animal of the\r\n same habits, and probably a closely allied species, but which I never\r\n saw. Its noise is different from that of the Maldonado kind; it is\r\n repeated only twice instead of three or four times, and is more\r\n distinct and sonorous: when heard from a distance it so closely\r\n resembles the sound made in cutting down a small tree with an axe,\r\n that I have sometimes remained in doubt concerning it.\r\n\r\nThe man who caught them asserted that very many are invariably found\r\nblind. A specimen which I preserved in spirits was in this state; Mr.\r\nReid considers it to be the effect of inflammation in the nictitating\r\nmembrane. When the animal was alive I placed my finger within half an\r\ninch of its head, and not the slightest notice was taken: it made its\r\nway, however, about the room nearly as well as the others. Considering\r\nthe strictly subterranean habits of the tucu-tuco, the blindness,\r\nthough so common, cannot be a very serious evil; yet it appears strange\r\nthat any animal should possess an organ frequently subject to be\r\ninjured. Lamarck would have been delighted with this fact, had he known\r\nit, when speculating[7] (probably with more truth than usual with him)\r\non the gradually-_acquired_ blindness of the Aspalax, a Gnawer living\r\nunder ground, and of the Proteus, a reptile living in dark caverns\r\nfilled with water; in both of which animals the eye is in an almost\r\nrudimentary state, and is covered by a tendinous membrane and skin. In\r\nthe common mole the eye is extraordinarily small but perfect, though\r\nmany anatomists doubt whether it is connected with the true optic\r\nnerve; its vision must certainly be imperfect, though\r\nprobably useful to the animal when it leaves its burrow. In the\r\ntucu-tuco, which I believe never comes to the surface of the ground,\r\nthe eye is rather larger, but often rendered blind and useless, though\r\nwithout apparently causing any inconvenience to the animal; no doubt\r\nLamarck would have said that the tucu-tuco is now passing into the\r\nstate of the Aspalax and Proteus.\r\n\r\n [7] _Philosoph. Zoolog._ tome i, p. 242.\r\n\r\nBirds of many kinds are extremely abundant on the undulating grassy\r\nplains around Maldonado. There are several species of a family allied\r\nin structure and manners to our Starling: one of these (Molothrus\r\nniger) is remarkable from its habits. Several may often be seen\r\nstanding together on the back of a cow or horse; and while perched on a\r\nhedge, pluming themselves in the sun, they sometimes attempt to sing,\r\nor rather to hiss; the noise being very peculiar, resembling that of\r\nbubbles of air passing rapidly from a small orifice under water, so as\r\nto produce an acute sound. According to Azara, this bird, like the\r\ncuckoo, deposits its eggs in other birds’ nests. I was several times\r\ntold by the country people that there certainly is some bird having\r\nthis habit; and my assistant in collecting, who is a very accurate\r\nperson, found a nest of the sparrow of this country (Zonotrichia\r\nmatutina), with one egg in it larger than the others, and of a\r\ndifferent colour and shape. In North America there is another species\r\nof Molothrus (M. pecoris), which has a similar cuckoo-like habit, and\r\nwhich is most closely allied in every respect to the species from the\r\nPlata, even in such trifling peculiarities as standing on the backs of\r\ncattle; it differs only in being a little smaller, and in its plumage\r\nand eggs being of a slightly different shade of colour. This close\r\nagreement in structure and habits, in representative species coming\r\nfrom opposite quarters of a great continent, always strikes one as\r\ninteresting, though of common occurrence.\r\n\r\nMr. Swainson has well remarked,[8] that with the exception of the\r\nMolothrus pecoris, to which must be added the M. niger, the cuckoos are\r\nthe only birds which can be called truly parasitical; namely, such as\r\n“fasten themselves, as it were, on another living animal, whose animal\r\nheat brings their young into life, whose food they live upon, and whose\r\ndeath would\r\ncause theirs during the period of infancy.” It is remarkable that some\r\nof the species, but not all, both of the Cuckoo and Molothrus should\r\nagree in this one strange habit of their parasitical propagation,\r\nwhilst opposed to each other in almost every other habit: the\r\nmolothrus, like our starling, is eminently sociable, and lives on the\r\nopen plains without art or disguise: the cuckoo, as every one knows, is\r\na singularly shy bird; it frequents the most retired thickets, and\r\nfeeds on fruit and caterpillars. In structure also these two genera are\r\nwidely removed from each other. Many theories, even phrenological\r\ntheories, have been advanced to explain the origin of the cuckoo laying\r\nits eggs in other birds’ nests. M. Prévost alone, I think, has thrown\r\nlight by his observations[9] on this puzzle: he finds that the female\r\ncuckoo, which, according to most observers, lays at least from four to\r\nsix eggs, must pair with the male each time after laying only one or\r\ntwo eggs. Now, if the cuckoo was obliged to sit on her own eggs, she\r\nwould either have to sit on all together, and therefore leave those\r\nfirst laid so long, that they probably would become addled; or she\r\nwould have to hatch separately each egg or two eggs, as soon as laid:\r\nbut as the cuckoo stays a shorter time in this country than any other\r\nmigratory bird, she certainly would not have time enough for the\r\nsuccessive hatchings. Hence we can perceive in the fact of the cuckoo\r\npairing several times, and laying her eggs at intervals, the cause of\r\nher depositing her eggs in other birds’ nests, and leaving them to the\r\ncare of foster-parents. I am strongly inclined to believe that this\r\nview is correct, from having been independently led (as we shall\r\nhereafter see) to an analogous conclusion with regard to the South\r\nAmerican ostrich, the females of which are parasitical, if I may so\r\nexpress it, on each other; each female laying several eggs in the nests\r\nof several other females, and the male ostrich undertaking all the\r\ncares of incubation, like the strange foster-parents with the cuckoo.\r\n\r\n [8] _Magazine of Zoology and Botany_, vol. i, p. 217.\r\n\r\n\r\n [9] Read before the Academy of Sciences in Paris. L’Institut, 1834, p.\r\n 418.\r\n\r\nI will mention only two other birds, which are very common, and render\r\nthemselves prominent from their habits. The Saurophagus sulphuratus is\r\ntypical of the great American tribe of tyrant-flycatchers. In its\r\nstructure it closely approaches the true shrikes, but in its habits may\r\nbe compared to many birds. I have frequently observed it, hunting a\r\nfield, hovering over\r\none spot like a hawk, and then proceeding on to another. When seen thus\r\nsuspended in the air, it might very readily at a short distance be\r\nmistaken for one of the Rapacious order; its stoop, however, is very\r\ninferior in force and rapidity to that of a hawk. At other times the\r\nSaurophagus haunts the neighbourhood of water, and there, like a\r\nkingfisher, remaining stationary, it catches any small fish which may\r\ncome near the margin. These birds are not unfrequently kept either in\r\ncages or in courtyards, with their wings cut. They soon become tame,\r\nand are very amusing from their cunning odd manners, which were\r\ndescribed to me as being similar to those of the common magpie. Their\r\nflight is undulatory, for the weight of the head and bill appears too\r\ngreat for the body. In the evening the Saurophagus takes its stand on a\r\nbush, often by the roadside, and continually repeats without change a\r\nshrill and rather agreeable cry, which somewhat resembles articulate\r\nwords: the Spaniards say it is like the words “Bien te veo” (I see you\r\nwell), and accordingly have given it this name.\r\n\r\nA mocking-bird (Mimus orpheus), called by the inhabitants Calandria, is\r\nremarkable, from possessing a song far superior to that of any other\r\nbird in the country: indeed, it is nearly the only bird in South\r\nAmerica which I have observed to take its stand for the purpose of\r\nsinging. The song may be compared to that of the Sedge warbler, but is\r\nmore powerful; some harsh notes and some very high ones, being mingled\r\nwith a pleasant warbling. It is heard only during the spring. At other\r\ntimes its cry is harsh and far from harmonious. Near Maldonado these\r\nbirds were tame and bold; they constantly attended the country houses\r\nin numbers, to pick the meat which was hung up on the posts or walls:\r\nif any other small bird joined the feast, the Calandria soon chased it\r\naway. On the wide uninhabited plains of Patagonia another closely\r\nallied species, O. Patagonica of d’Orbigny, which frequents the valleys\r\nclothed with spiny bushes, is a wilder bird, and has a slightly\r\ndifferent tone of voice. It appears to me a curious circumstance, as\r\nshowing the fine shades of difference in habits, that judging from this\r\nlatter respect alone, when I first saw this second species, I thought\r\nit was different from the Maldonado kind. Having afterwards procured a\r\nspecimen, and comparing the two without particular care, they appeared\r\nso very similar,\r\nthat I changed my opinion; but now Mr. Gould says that they are\r\ncertainly distinct; a conclusion in conformity with the trifling\r\ndifference of habit, of which, however, he was not aware.\r\n\r\nThe number, tameness, and disgusting habits of the carrion-feeding\r\nhawks of South America make them pre-eminently striking to any one\r\naccustomed only to the birds of Northern Europe. In this list may be\r\nincluded four species of the Caracara or Polyborus, the Turkey buzzard,\r\nthe Gallinazo, and the Condor. The Caracaras are, from their structure,\r\nplaced among the eagles: we shall soon see how ill they become so high\r\na rank. In their habits they well supply the place of our\r\ncarrion-crows, magpies, and ravens; a tribe of birds widely distributed\r\nover the rest of the world, but entirely absent in South America. To\r\nbegin with the Polyborus Brasiliensis: this is a common bird, and has a\r\nwide geographical range; it is most numerous on the grassy savannahs of\r\nLa Plata (where it goes by the name of Carrancha), and is far from\r\nunfrequent throughout the sterile plains of Patagonia. In the desert\r\nbetween the rivers Negro and Colorado, numbers constantly attend the\r\nline of road to devour the carcasses of the exhausted animals which\r\nchance to perish from fatigue and thirst. Although thus common in these\r\ndry and open countries, and likewise on the arid shores of the Pacific,\r\nit is nevertheless found inhabiting the damp impervious forests of West\r\nPatagonia and Tierra del Fuego. The Carranchas, together with the\r\nChimango, constantly attend in numbers the estancias and\r\nslaughtering-houses. If an animal dies on the plain the Gallinazo\r\ncommences the feast, and then the two species of Polyborus pick the\r\nbones clean. These birds, although thus commonly feeding together, are\r\nfar from being friends. When the Carrancha is quietly seated on the\r\nbranch of a tree or on the ground, the Chimango often continues for a\r\nlong time flying backwards and forwards, up and down, in a semicircle,\r\ntrying each time at the bottom of the curve to strike its larger\r\nrelative. The Carrancha takes little notice, except by bobbing its\r\nhead. Although the Carranchas frequently assemble in numbers, they are\r\nnot gregarious; for in desert places they may be seen solitary, or more\r\ncommonly by pairs.\r\n\r\nThe Carranchas are said to be very crafty, and to steal great\r\nnumbers of eggs. They attempt, also, together with the Chimango, to\r\npick off the scabs from the sore backs of horses and mules. The poor\r\nanimal, on the one hand, with its ears down and its back arched; and,\r\non the other, the hovering bird, eyeing at the distance of a yard the\r\ndisgusting morsel, form a picture, which has been described by Captain\r\nHead with his own peculiar spirit and accuracy. These false eagles most\r\nrarely kill any living bird or animal; and their vulture-like,\r\nnecrophagous habits are very evident to any one who has fallen asleep\r\non the desolate plains of Patagonia, for when he wakes, he will see, on\r\neach surrounding hillock, one of these birds patiently watching him\r\nwith an evil eye: it is a feature in the landscape of these countries,\r\nwhich will be recognised by every one who has wandered over them. If a\r\nparty of men go out hunting with dogs and horses, they will be\r\naccompanied, during the day, by several of these attendants. After\r\nfeeding, the uncovered craw protrudes; at such times, and indeed\r\ngenerally, the Carrancha is an inactive, tame, and cowardly bird. Its\r\nflight is heavy and slow, like that of an English rook. It seldom\r\nsoars; but I have twice seen one at a great height gliding through the\r\nair with much ease. It runs (in contradistinction to hopping), but not\r\nquite so quickly as some of its congeners. At times the Carrancha is\r\nnoisy, but is not generally so: its cry is loud, very harsh and\r\npeculiar, and may be likened to the sound of the Spanish guttural _g_,\r\nfollowed by a rough double _r r_; when uttering this cry it elevates\r\nits head higher and higher, till at last, with its beak wide open, the\r\ncrown almost touches the lower part of the back. This fact, which has\r\nbeen doubted, is quite true; I have seen them several times with their\r\nheads backwards in a completely inverted position. To these\r\nobservations I may add, on the high authority of Azara, that the\r\nCarrancha feeds on worms, shells, slugs, grasshoppers, and frogs; that\r\nit destroys young lambs by tearing the umbilical cord; and that it\r\npursues the Gallinazo, till that bird is compelled to vomit up the\r\ncarrion it may have recently gorged. Lastly, Azara states that several\r\nCarranchas, five or six together, will unite in chase of large birds,\r\neven such as herons. All these facts show that it is a bird of very\r\nversatile habits and considerable ingenuity.\r\n\r\nThe Polyborus Chimango is considerably smaller than the\r\nlast species. It is truly omnivorous, and will eat even bread; and I\r\nwas assured that it materially injures the potato-crops in Chiloe, by\r\nstocking up the roots when first planted. Of all the carrion-feeders it\r\nis generally the last which leaves the skeleton of a dead animal, and\r\nmay often be seen within the ribs of a cow or horse, like a bird in a\r\ncage. Another species is the Polyborus Novæ Zelandiæ, which is\r\nexceedingly common in the Falkland Islands. These birds in many\r\nrespects resemble in their habits the Carranchas. They live on the\r\nflesh of dead animals and on marine productions; and on the Ramirez\r\nrocks their whole sustenance must depend on the sea. They are\r\nextraordinarily tame and fearless, and haunt the neighbourhood of\r\nhouses for offal. If a hunting party kills an animal, a number soon\r\ncollect and patiently await, standing on the ground on all sides. After\r\neating, their uncovered craws are largely protruded, giving them a\r\ndisgusting appearance. They readily attack wounded birds: a cormorant\r\nin this state having taken to the shore, was immediately seized on by\r\nseveral, and its death hastened by their blows. The _Beagle_ was at the\r\nFalklands only during the summer, but the officers of the _ Adventure_,\r\nwho were there in the winter, mention many extraordinary instances of\r\nthe boldness and rapacity of these birds. They actually pounced on a\r\ndog that was lying fast asleep close by one of the party; and the\r\nsportsmen had difficulty in preventing the wounded geese from being\r\nseized before their eyes. It is said that several together (in this\r\nrespect resembling the Carranchas) wait at the mouth of a rabbit-hole,\r\nand together seize on the animal when it comes out. They were\r\nconstantly flying on board the vessel when in the harbour; and it was\r\nnecessary to keep a good look-out to prevent the leather being torn\r\nfrom the rigging, and the meat or game from the stern. These birds are\r\nvery mischievous and inquisitive; they will pick up almost anything\r\nfrom the ground; a large black glazed hat was carried nearly a mile, as\r\nwas a pair of the heavy balls used in catching cattle. Mr. Usborne\r\nexperienced during the survey a more severe loss, in their stealing a\r\nsmall Kater’s compass in a red morocco leather case, which was never\r\nrecovered. These birds are, moreover, quarrelsome and very passionate;\r\ntearing up the grass with their bills from rage. They are not truly\r\ngregarious; they do not soar, and their\r\nflight is heavy and clumsy; on the ground they run extremely fast, very\r\nmuch like pheasants. They are noisy, uttering several harsh cries, one\r\nof which is like that of the English rook, hence the sealers always\r\ncall them rooks. It is a curious circumstance that, when crying out,\r\nthey throw their heads upwards and backwards, after the same manner as\r\nthe Carrancha. They build in the rocky cliffs of the sea-coast, but\r\nonly on the small adjoining islets, and not on the two main islands:\r\nthis is a singular precaution in so tame and fearless a bird. The\r\nsealers say that the flesh of these birds, when cooked, is quite white,\r\nand very good eating; but bold must the man be who attempts such a\r\nmeal.\r\n\r\nWe have now only to mention the turkey-buzzard (Vultur aura), and the\r\nGallinazo. The former is found wherever the country is moderately damp,\r\nfrom Cape Horn to North America. Differently from the Polyborus\r\nBrasiliensis and Chimango, it has found its way to the Falkland\r\nIslands. The turkey-buzzard is a solitary bird, or at most goes in\r\npairs. It may at once be recognised from a long distance, by its lofty,\r\nsoaring, and most elegant flight. It is well known to be a true\r\ncarrion-feeder. On the west coast of Patagonia, among the\r\nthickly-wooded islets and broken land, it lives exclusively on what the\r\nsea throws up, and on the carcasses of dead seals. Wherever these\r\nanimals are congregated on the rocks, there the vultures may be seen.\r\nThe Gallinazo (Cathartes atratus) has a different range from the last\r\nspecies, as it never occurs southward of lat. 41°. Azara states that\r\nthere exists a tradition that these birds, at the time of the conquest,\r\nwere not found near Monte Video, but that they subsequently followed\r\nthe inhabitants from more northern districts. At the present day they\r\nare numerous in the valley of the Colorado, which is three hundred\r\nmiles due south of Monte Video. It seems probable that this additional\r\nmigration has happened since the time of Azara. The Gallinazo generally\r\nprefers a humid climate, or rather the neighbourhood of fresh water;\r\nhence it is extremely abundant in Brazil and La Plata, while it is\r\nnever found on the desert and arid plains of Northern Patagonia,\r\nexcepting near some stream. These birds frequent the whole Pampas to\r\nthe foot of the Cordillera, but I never saw or heard of one in Chile:\r\nin Peru they are preserved as scavengers. These vultures certainly may\r\nbe called gregarious, for\r\nthey seem to have pleasure in society, and are not solely brought\r\ntogether by the attraction of a common prey. On a fine day a flock may\r\noften be observed at a great height, each bird wheeling round and round\r\nwithout closing its wings, in the most graceful evolutions. This is\r\nclearly performed for the mere pleasure of the exercise, or perhaps is\r\nconnected with their matrimonial alliances.\r\n\r\nI have now mentioned all the carrion-feeders, excepting the condor, an\r\naccount of which will be more appropriately introduced when we visit a\r\ncountry more congenial to its habits than the plains of La Plata.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a broad band of sand-hillocks which separate the Laguna del Potrero\r\nfrom the shores of the Plata, at the distance of a few miles from\r\nMaldonado, I found a group of those vitrified, siliceous tubes, which\r\nare formed by lightning entering loose sand. These tubes resemble in\r\nevery particular those from Drigg in Cumberland, described in the\r\n_Geological Transactions._[10] The sand-hillocks of Maldonado, not\r\nbeing protected by vegetation, are constantly changing their position.\r\nFrom this cause the tubes projected above the surface; and numerous\r\nfragments lying near, showed that they had formerly been buried to a\r\ngreater depth. Four sets entered the sand perpendicularly: by working\r\nwith my hands I traced one of them two feet deep; and some fragments\r\nwhich evidently had belonged to the same tube, when added to the other\r\npart, measured five feet three inches. The diameter of the whole tube\r\nwas nearly equal, and therefore we must suppose that originally it\r\nextended to a much greater depth. These dimensions are however small,\r\ncompared to those of the tubes from Drigg, one of which was traced to a\r\ndepth of not less than thirty feet.\r\n\r\n [10] _Geological Transactions_, vol. ii, p. 528. In the _Philosophical\r\n Transactions_, 1790, p. 294, Dr. Priestley has described some\r\n imperfect siliceous tubes and a melted pebble of quartz, found in\r\n digging into the ground, under a tree, where a man had been killed by\r\n lightning.\r\n\r\nThe internal surface is completely vitrified, glossy, and smooth. A\r\nsmall fragment examined under the microscope appeared, from the number\r\nof minute entangled air or perhaps steam bubbles, like an assay fused\r\nbefore the blowpipe. The sand is entirely, or in greater part,\r\nsiliceous; but some points\r\nare of a black colour, and from their glossy surface possess a metallic\r\nlustre. The thickness of the wall of the tube varies from a thirtieth\r\nto a twentieth of an inch, and occasionally even equals a tenth. On the\r\noutside the grains of sand are rounded, and have a slightly glazed\r\nappearance: I could not distinguish any signs of crystallisation. In a\r\nsimilar manner to that described in the _ Geological Transactions_, the\r\ntubes are generally compressed, and have deep longitudinal furrows, so\r\nas closely to resemble a shrivelled vegetable stalk, or the bark of the\r\nelm or cork tree. Their circumference is about two inches, but in some\r\nfragments, which are cylindrical and without any furrows, it is as much\r\nas four inches. The compression from the surrounding loose sand, acting\r\nwhile the tube was still softened from the effects of the intense heat,\r\nhas evidently caused the creases or furrows. Judging from the\r\nuncompressed fragments, the measure or bore of the lightning (if such a\r\nterm may be used) must have been about one inch and a quarter. At\r\nParis, M. Hachette and M. Beudant[11] succeeded in making tubes, in\r\nmost respects similar to these fulgurites, by passing very strong\r\nshocks of galvanism through finely-powdered glass: when salt was added,\r\nso as to increase its fusibility, the tubes were larger in every\r\ndimension. They failed both with powdered feldspar and quartz. One\r\ntube, formed with pounded glass, was very nearly an inch long, namely\r\n.982, and had an internal diameter of .019 of an inch. When we hear\r\nthat the strongest battery in Paris was used, and that its power on a\r\nsubstance of such easy fusibility as glass was to form tubes so\r\ndiminutive, we must feel greatly astonished at the force of a shock of\r\nlightning, which, striking the sand in several places, has formed\r\ncylinders, in one instance of at least thirty feet long, and having an\r\ninternal bore, where not compressed, of full an inch and a half; and\r\nthis in a material so extraordinarily refractory as quartz!\r\n\r\n [11] _Annales de Chimie et de Physique_, tome xxxvii, p. 319.\r\n\r\nThe tubes, as I have already remarked, enter the sand nearly in a\r\nvertical direction. One, however, which was less regular than the\r\nothers, deviated from a right line, at the most considerable bend, to\r\nthe amount of thirty-three degrees. From this same tube, two small\r\nbranches, about a foot apart, were sent off; one pointed downwards, and\r\nthe other upwards. This\r\nlatter case is remarkable, as the electric fluid must have turned back\r\nat the acute angle of 26°, to the line of its main course. Besides the\r\nfour tubes which I found vertical, and traced beneath the surface,\r\nthere were several other groups of fragments, the original sites of\r\nwhich without doubt were near. All occurred in a level area of shifting\r\nsand, sixty yards by twenty, situated among some high sand-hillocks,\r\nand at the distance of about half a mile from a chain of hills four or\r\nfive hundred feet in height. The most remarkable circumstance, as it\r\nappears to me, in this case as well as in that of Drigg, and in one\r\ndescribed by M. Ribbentrop in Germany, is the number of tubes found\r\nwithin such limited spaces. At Drigg, within an area of fifteen yards,\r\nthree were observed, and the same number occurred in Germany. In the\r\ncase which I have described, certainly more than four existed within\r\nthe space of the sixty by twenty yards. As it does not appear probable\r\nthat the tubes are produced by successive distinct shocks, we must\r\nbelieve that the lightning, shortly before entering the ground, divides\r\nitself into separate branches.\r\n\r\nThe neighbourhood of the Rio Plata seems peculiarly subject to electric\r\nphenomena. In the year 1793,[12] one of the most destructive\r\nthunderstorms perhaps on record happened at Buenos Ayres: thirty-seven\r\nplaces within the city were struck by lightning, and nineteen people\r\nkilled. From facts stated in several books of travels, I am inclined to\r\nsuspect that thunderstorms are very common near the mouths of great\r\nrivers. Is it not possible that the mixture of large bodies of fresh\r\nand salt water may disturb the electrical equilibrium? Even during our\r\noccasional visits to this part of South America, we heard of a ship,\r\ntwo churches, and a house having been struck. Both the church and the\r\nhouse I saw shortly afterwards: the house belonged to Mr. Hood, the\r\nconsul-general at Monte Video. Some of the effects were curious: the\r\npaper, for nearly a foot on each side of the line where the bell-wires\r\nhad run, was blackened. The metal had been fused, and although the room\r\nwas about fifteen feet high, the globules, dropping on the chairs and\r\nfurniture, had drilled in them a chain of minute holes. A part of the\r\nwall was shattered as if by gunpowder, and the fragments had been blown\r\noff with force sufficient to dent the wall on the\r\nopposite side of the room. The frame of a looking-glass was blackened,\r\nand the gilding must have been volatilised, for a smelling-bottle,\r\nwhich stood on the chimney-piece, was coated with bright metallic\r\nparticles, which adhered as firmly as if they had been enamelled.\r\n\r\n [12] Azara’s _Voyage_, vol. i, p. 36.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IV\r\n\r\n\r\nRio Negro—Estancias attacked by the Indians—Salt Lakes—Flamingoes—R.\r\nNegro to R.

This is the\r\nprincipal river on the whole line of coast between the Strait of\r\nMagellan and the Plata. It enters the sea about three hundred miles\r\nsouth of the estuary of the Plata. About fifty years ago, under the old\r\nSpanish government, a small colony was established here; and it is\r\nstill the most southern position (lat. 41°) on this eastern coast of\r\nAmerica inhabited by civilised man.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe country near the mouth of the river is wretched in the extreme: on\r\nthe south side a long line of perpendicular cliffs commences, which\r\nexposes a section of the geological nature of the country. The strata\r\nare of sandstone, and one layer was remarkable from being composed of a\r\nfirmly-cemented conglomerate of pumice pebbles, which must have\r\ntravelled more than four hundred miles, from the Andes. The surface is\r\neverywhere covered up by a thick bed of gravel, which extends far and\r\nwide over the open plain. Water is extremely scarce, and, where found,\r\nis almost invariably brackish. The vegetation is scanty; and although\r\nthere are bushes of many kinds, all are armed with formidable thorns,\r\nwhich seem to warn the stranger not to enter on these inhospitable\r\nregions.\r\n\r\nThe settlement is situated eighteen miles up the river. The road\r\nfollows the foot of the sloping cliff, which forms the northern\r\nboundary of the great valley in which the Rio Negro flows. On the way\r\nwe passed the ruins of some fine estancias, which a few years since had\r\nbeen destroyed by the Indians. They withstood several attacks. A man\r\npresent at one gave me a very lively description of what took place.\r\nThe inhabitants had sufficient notice to drive all the cattle and\r\nhorses into the “corral”[1] which surrounded the house, and likewise to\r\nmount some small cannon.\r\n\r\n [1] The corral is an enclosure made of tall and strong stakes. Every\r\n estancia, or farming estate, has one attached to it.\r\n\r\nThe Indians were Araucanians from the south of Chile; several hundreds\r\nin number, and highly disciplined. They first appeared in two bodies on\r\na neighbouring hill; having there dismounted, and taken off their fur\r\nmantles, they advanced naked to the charge. The only weapon of an\r\nIndian is a very long bamboo or chuzo, ornamented with ostrich\r\nfeathers, and pointed by a sharp spear-head. My informer seemed to\r\nremember with the greatest horror the quivering of these chuzos as they\r\napproached near. When close, the cacique Pincheira hailed the besieged\r\nto give up their arms, or he would cut all their throats. As this would\r\nprobably have been the result of their entrance under any\r\ncircumstances, the answer was given by a volley of musketry. The\r\nIndians, with great steadiness, came to the very fence of the corral:\r\nbut to their surprise they found the posts fastened\r\ntogether by iron nails instead of leather thongs, and, of course, in\r\nvain attempted to cut them with their knives. This saved the lives of\r\nthe Christians: many of the wounded Indians were carried away by their\r\ncompanions, and at last, one of the under caciques being wounded, the\r\nbugle sounded a retreat. They retired to their horses, and seemed to\r\nhold a council of war. This was an awful pause for the Spaniards, as\r\nall their ammunition, with the exception of a few cartridges, was\r\nexpended. In an instant the Indians mounted their horses, and galloped\r\nout of sight. Another attack was still more quickly repulsed. A cool\r\nFrenchman managed the gun; he stopped till the Indians approached\r\nclose, and then raked their line with grape-shot: he thus laid\r\nthirty-nine of them on the ground; and, of course, such a blow\r\nimmediately routed the whole party.\r\n\r\nThe town is indifferently called El Carmen or Patagones. It is built on\r\nthe face of a cliff which fronts the river, and many of the houses are\r\nexcavated even in the sandstone. The river is about two or three\r\nhundred yards wide, and is deep and rapid. The many islands, with their\r\nwillow-trees, and the flat headlands, seen one behind the other on the\r\nnorthern boundary of the broad green valley, form, by the aid of a\r\nbright sun, a view almost picturesque. The number of inhabitants does\r\nnot exceed a few hundreds. These Spanish colonies do not, like our\r\nBritish ones, carry within themselves the elements of growth. Many\r\nIndians of pure blood reside here: the tribe of the Cacique Lucanee\r\nconstantly have their Toldos[2] on the outskirts of the town. The local\r\ngovernment partly supplies them with provisions, by giving them all the\r\nold worn-out horses, and they earn a little by making horse-rugs and\r\nother articles of riding-gear. These Indians are considered civilised;\r\nbut what their character may have gained by a lesser degree of\r\nferocity, is almost counterbalanced by their entire immorality. Some of\r\nthe younger men are, however, improving; they are willing to labour,\r\nand a short time since a party went on a sealing-voyage, and behaved\r\nvery well. They were now enjoying the fruits of their labour, by being\r\ndressed in very gay, clean clothes, and by being very idle. The taste\r\nthey showed in their dress was admirable; if you could have turned one\r\nof these young\r\nIndians into a statue of bronze, his drapery would have been perfectly\r\ngraceful.\r\n\r\n [2] The hovels of the Indians are thus called.\r\n\r\nOne day I rode to a large salt-lake, or Salina, which is distant\r\nfifteen miles from the town. During the winter it consists of a shallow\r\nlake of brine, which in summer is converted into a field of snow-white\r\nsalt. The layer near the margin is from four to five inches thick, but\r\ntowards the centre its thickness increases. This lake was two and a\r\nhalf miles long, and one broad. Others occur in the neighbourhood many\r\ntimes larger, and with a floor of salt, two and three feet in\r\nthickness, even when under water during the winter. One of these\r\nbrilliantly white and level expanses, in the midst of the brown and\r\ndesolate plain, offers an extraordinary spectacle. A large quantity of\r\nsalt is annually drawn from the salina: and great piles, some hundred\r\ntons in weight, were lying ready for exportation.\r\n\r\nThe season for working the salinas forms the harvest of Patagones; for\r\non it the prosperity of the place depends. Nearly the whole population\r\nencamps on the bank of the river, and the people are employed in\r\ndrawing out the salt in bullock-waggons. This salt is crystallised in\r\ngreat cubes, and is remarkably pure: Mr. Trenham Reeks has kindly\r\nanalysed some for me, and he finds in it only 0.26 of gypsum and 0.22\r\nof earthy matter. It is a singular fact that it does not serve so well\r\nfor preserving meat as sea-salt from the Cape de Verd islands; and a\r\nmerchant at Buenos Ayres told me that he considered it as fifty per\r\ncent less valuable. Hence the Cape de Verd salt is constantly imported,\r\nand is mixed with that from these salinas. The purity of the Patagonian\r\nsalt, or absence from it of those other saline bodies found in all\r\nsea-water, is the only assignable cause for this inferiority: a\r\nconclusion which no one, I think, would have suspected, but which is\r\nsupported by the fact lately ascertained,[3] that those salts answer\r\nbest for preserving cheese which contain most of the deliquescent\r\nchlorides.\r\n\r\n [3] Report of the Agricultural Chemistry Association in the\r\n _Agricultural Gazette_, 1845, p. 93.\r\n\r\nThe border of the lake is formed of mud: and in this numerous large\r\ncrystals of gypsum, some of which are three inches long, lie embedded;\r\nwhilst on the surface others of sulphate of soda lie scattered about.\r\nThe Gauchos call the former\r\nthe “Padre del sal,” and the latter the “Madre;” they state that these\r\nprogenitive salts always occur on the borders of the salinas, when the\r\nwater begins to evaporate. The mud is black, and has a fetid odour. I\r\ncould not at first imagine the cause of this, but I afterwards\r\nperceived that the froth which the wind drifted on shore was coloured\r\ngreen, as if by confervæ; I attempted to carry home some of this green\r\nmatter, but from an accident failed. Parts of the lake seen from a\r\nshort distance appeared of a reddish colour, and this perhaps was owing\r\nto some infusorial animalcula. The mud in many places was thrown up by\r\nnumbers of some kind of worm, or annelidous animal. How surprising it\r\nis that any creatures should be able to exist in brine, and that they\r\nshould be crawling among crystals of sulphate of soda and lime! And\r\nwhat becomes of these worms when, during the long summer, the surface\r\nis hardened into a solid layer of salt?\r\n\r\nFlamingoes in considerable numbers inhabit this lake, and breed here,\r\nthroughout Patagonia, in Northern Chile, and at the Galapagos Islands,\r\nI met with these birds wherever there were lakes of brine. I saw them\r\nhere wading about in search of food—probably for the worms which burrow\r\nin the mud; and these latter probably feed on infusoria or confervæ.\r\nThus we have a little living world within itself, adapted to these\r\ninland lakes of brine. A minute crustaceous animal (Cancer salinus) is\r\nsaid[4] to live in countless numbers in the brine-pans at Lymington:\r\nbut only in those in which the fluid has attained, from evaporation,\r\nconsiderable strength—namely, about a quarter of a pound of salt to a\r\npint of water. Well may we affirm that every part of the world is\r\nhabitable! Whether lakes of brine, or those subterranean ones hidden\r\nbeneath volcanic mountains—warm mineral springs—the wide expanse and\r\ndepths of the ocean—the\r\nupper regions of the atmosphere, and even the surface of perpetual\r\nsnow—all support organic beings.\r\n\r\n [4] _Linnæan Transactions_, vol. xi, p. 205. It is remarkable how all\r\n the circumstances connected with the salt-lakes in Siberia and\r\n Patagonia are similar. Siberia, like Patagonia, appears to have been\r\n recently elevated above the waters of the sea. In both countries the\r\n salt-lakes occupy shallow depressions in the plains; in both the mud\r\n on the borders is black and fetid; beneath the crust of common salt,\r\n sulphate of soda or of magnesia occurs, imperfectly crystallised; and\r\n in both, the muddy sand is mixed with lentils of gypsum. The Siberian\r\n salt-lakes are inhabited by small crustaceous animals; and flamingoes\r\n (_Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal_, Jan. 1830) likewise frequent\r\n them. As these circumstances, apparently so trifling, occur in two\r\n distant continents, we may feel sure that they are the necessary\r\n results of common causes.—See _Pallas’s Travels_, 1793 to 1794, pp.\r\n 129 to 134.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the northward of the Rio Negro, between it and the inhabited country\r\nnear Buenos Ayres, the Spaniards have only one small settlement,\r\nrecently established at Bahia Blanca. The distance in a straight line\r\nto Buenos Ayres is very nearly five hundred British miles. The\r\nwandering tribes of horse Indians, which have always occupied the\r\ngreater part of this country, having of late much harassed the outlying\r\nestancias, the government at Buenos Ayres equipped some time since an\r\narmy under the command of General Rosas for the purpose of\r\nexterminating them. The troops were now encamped on the banks of the\r\nColorado; a river lying about eighty miles northward of the Rio Negro.\r\nWhen General Rosas left Buenos Ayres he struck in a direct line across\r\nthe unexplored plains: and as the country was thus pretty well cleared\r\nof Indians, he left behind him, at wide intervals, a small party of\r\nsoldiers with a troop of horses (_a posta_), so as to be enabled to\r\nkeep up a communication with the capital. As the _Beagle_ intended to\r\ncall at Bahia Blanca, I determined to proceed there by land; and\r\nultimately I extended my plan to travel the whole way by the postas to\r\nBuenos Ayres.\r\n\r\n\r\n_August_ 11_th_, 1833.—Mr. Harris, an Englishman residing at Patagones,\r\na guide, and five Gauchos who were proceeding to the army on business,\r\nwere my companions on the journey. The Colorado, as I have already\r\nsaid, is nearly eighty miles distant: and as we travelled slowly, we\r\nwere two days and a half on the road. The whole line of country\r\ndeserves scarcely a better name than that of a desert. Water is found\r\nonly in two small wells; it is called fresh; but even at this time of\r\nthe year, during the rainy season, it was quite brackish. In the summer\r\nthis must be a distressing passage; for now it was sufficiently\r\ndesolate.\r\n\r\nThe valley of the Rio Negro, broad as it is, has merely been excavated\r\nout of the sandstone plain; for immediately above the bank on which the\r\ntown stands, a level country commences, which is interrupted only by a\r\nfew trifling valleys and depressions. Everywhere the landscape wears\r\nthe same sterile aspect; a dry gravelly soil supports tufts of\r\nbrown withered grass, and low scattered bushes, armed with thorns.\r\n\r\nShortly after passing the first spring we came in sight of a famous\r\ntree, which the Indians reverence as the altar of Walleechu. It is\r\nsituated on a high part of the plain; and hence is a landmark visible\r\nat a great distance. As soon as a tribe of Indians come in sight of it,\r\nthey offer their adorations by loud shouts. The tree itself is low,\r\nmuch branched, and thorny: just above the root it has a diameter of\r\nabout three feet. It stands by itself without any neighbour, and was\r\nindeed the first tree we saw; afterwards we met with a few others of\r\nthe same kind, but they were far from common. Being winter the tree had\r\nno leaves, but in their place numberless threads, by which the various\r\nofferings, such as cigars, bread, meat, pieces of cloth, etc., had been\r\nsuspended. Poor Indians, not having anything better, only pull a thread\r\nout of their ponchos, and fasten it to the tree. Richer Indians are\r\naccustomed to pour spirits and maté into a certain hole, and likewise\r\nto smoke upwards, thinking thus to afford all possible gratification to\r\nWalleechu. To complete the scene, the tree was surrounded by the\r\nbleached bones of horses which had been slaughtered as sacrifices. All\r\nIndians of every age and sex make their offerings; they then think that\r\ntheir horses will not tire, and that they themselves shall be\r\nprosperous. The Gaucho who told me this, said that in the time of peace\r\nhe had witnessed this scene, and that he and others used to wait till\r\nthe Indians had passed by, for the sake of stealing from Walleechu the\r\nofferings.\r\n\r\nThe Gauchos think that the Indians consider the tree as the god itself;\r\nbut it seems far more probable that they regard it as the altar. The\r\nonly cause which I can imagine for this choice, is its being a landmark\r\nin a dangerous passage. The Sierra de la Ventana is visible at an\r\nimmense distance; and a Gaucho told me that he was once riding with an\r\nIndian a few miles to the north of the Rio Colorado, when the Indian\r\ncommenced making the same loud noise, which is usual at the first sight\r\nof the distant tree, putting his hand to his head, and then pointing in\r\nthe direction of the Sierra. Upon being asked the reason of this, the\r\nIndian said in broken Spanish, “First see the Sierra.”\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout two leagues beyond this curious tree we halted for the night: at\r\nthis instant an unfortunate cow was spied by the lynx-eyed Gauchos, who\r\nset off in full chase, and in a few minutes dragged her in with their\r\nlazos, and slaughtered her. We here had the four necessaries of life\r\n“en el campo,”—pasture for the horses, water (only a muddy puddle),\r\nmeat and firewood. The Gauchos were in high spirits at finding all\r\nthese luxuries; and we soon set to work at the poor cow. This was the\r\nfirst night which I passed under the open sky, with the gear of the\r\nrecado for my bed. There is high enjoyment in the independence of the\r\nGaucho life—to be able at any moment to pull up your horse, and say,\r\n“Here we will pass the night.” The deathlike stillness of the plain,\r\nthe dogs keeping watch, the gipsy-group of Gauchos making their beds\r\nround the fire, have left in my mind a strongly-marked picture of this\r\nfirst night, which will never be forgotten.\r\n\r\nThe next day the country continued similar to that above described. It\r\nis inhabited by few birds or animals of any kind. Occasionally a deer,\r\nor a Guanaco (wild Llama) may be seen; but the Agouti (Cavia\r\nPatagonica) is the commonest quadruped. This animal here represents our\r\nhares. It differs, however, from that genus in many essential respects;\r\nfor instance, it has only three toes behind. It is also nearly twice\r\nthe size, weighing from twenty to twenty-five pounds. The Agouti is a\r\ntrue friend of the desert; it is a common feature of the landscape to\r\nsee two or three hopping quickly one after the other in a straight line\r\nacross these wild plains. They are found as far north as the Sierra\r\nTapalguen (lat. 37° 30′), where the plain rather suddenly becomes\r\ngreener and more humid; and their southern limit is between Port Desire\r\nand St. Julian, where there is no change in the nature of the country.\r\n\r\nIt is a singular fact, that although the Agouti is not now found as far\r\nsouth as Port St. Julian, yet that Captain Wood, in his voyage in 1670,\r\ntalks of them as being numerous there. What cause can have altered, in\r\na wide, uninhabited, and rarely-visited country, the range of an animal\r\nlike this? It appears also, from the number shot by Captain Wood in one\r\nday at Port Desire, that they must have been considerably more abundant\r\nthere formerly than at present. Where the Bizcacha lives and makes its\r\nburrows, the Agouti uses them;\r\nbut where, as at Bahia Blanca, the Bizcacha is not found, the Agouti\r\nburrows for itself. The same thing occurs with the little owl of the\r\nPampas (Athene cunicularia), which has so often been described as\r\nstanding like a sentinel at the mouth of the burrows; for in Banda\r\nOriental, owing to the absence of the Bizcacha, it is obliged to hollow\r\nout its own habitation.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, as we approached the Rio Colorado, the appearance of\r\nthe country changed; we soon came on a plain covered with turf, which,\r\nfrom its flowers, tall clover, and little owls, resembled the Pampas.\r\nWe passed also a muddy swamp of considerable extent, which in summer\r\ndries, and becomes incrusted with various salts; and hence is called a\r\nsalitral. It was covered by low succulent plants, of the same kind with\r\nthose growing on the sea-shore. The Colorado, at the pass where we\r\ncrossed it, is only about sixty yards wide; generally it must be nearly\r\ndouble that width. Its course is very tortuous, being marked by\r\nwillow-trees and beds of reeds: in a direct line the distance to the\r\nmouth of the river is said to be nine leagues, but by water\r\ntwenty-five. We were delayed crossing in the canoe by some immense\r\ntroops of mares, which were swimming the river in order to follow a\r\ndivision of troops into the interior. A more ludicrous spectacle I\r\nnever beheld than the hundreds and hundreds of heads, all directed one\r\nway, with pointed ears and distended snorting nostrils, appearing just\r\nabove the water like a great shoal of some amphibious animal. Mare’s\r\nflesh is the only food which the soldiers have when on an expedition.\r\nThis gives them a great facility of movement; for the distance to which\r\nhorses can be driven over these plains is quite surprising: I have been\r\nassured that an unloaded horse can travel a hundred miles a day for\r\nmany days successively.\r\n\r\nThe encampment of General Rosas was close to the river. It consisted of\r\na square formed by waggons, artillery, straw huts, etc. The soldiers\r\nwere nearly all cavalry; and I should think such a villainous,\r\nbanditti-like army was never before collected together. The greater\r\nnumber of men were of a mixed breed, between Negro, Indian, and\r\nSpaniard. I know not the reason, but men of such origin seldom have a\r\ngood expression of countenance. I called on the Secretary\r\nto show my passport. He began to cross-question me in the most\r\ndignified and mysterious manner. By good luck I had a letter of\r\nrecommendation from the government of Buenos Ayres[5] to the commandant\r\nof Patagones. This was taken to General Rosas, who sent me a very\r\nobliging message; and the Secretary returned all smiles and\r\ngraciousness. We took up our residence in the _rancho_, or hovel, of a\r\ncurious old Spaniard, who had served with Napoleon in the expedition\r\nagainst Russia.\r\n\r\n [5] I am bound to express, in the strongest terms, my obligation to\r\n the government of Buenos Ayres for the obliging manner in which\r\n passports to all parts of the country were given me, as naturalist of\r\n the _Beagle._\r\n\r\nWe stayed two days at the Colorado; I had little to do, for the\r\nsurrounding country was a swamp, which in summer (December), when the\r\nsnow melts on the Cordillera, is overflowed by the river. My chief\r\namusement was watching the Indian families as they came to buy little\r\narticles at the rancho where we stayed. It was supposed that General\r\nRosas had about six hundred Indian allies. The men were a tall, fine\r\nrace, yet it was afterwards easy to see in the Fuegian savage the same\r\ncountenance rendered hideous by cold, want of food, and less\r\ncivilisation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nSome authors, in defining the primary races of mankind, have separated\r\nthese Indians into two classes; but this is certainly incorrect. Among\r\nthe young women or chinas, some deserve to be called even beautiful.\r\nTheir hair was coarse, but bright and black; and they wore it in two\r\nplaits hanging down to the waist. They had a high colour, and eyes that\r\nglistened with brilliancy; their legs, feet, and arms were small and\r\nelegantly formed; their ankles, and sometimes their waists, were\r\nornamented by broad bracelets of blue beads. Nothing could be more\r\ninteresting than some of the family groups. A mother with one or two\r\ndaughters would often come to our rancho, mounted on the same horse.\r\nThey ride like men, but with their knees tucked up much higher. This\r\nhabit, perhaps, arises from their being accustomed, when travelling, to\r\nride the loaded horses. The duty of the women is to load and unload the\r\nhorses; to make the tents for the night; in short to be, like the wives\r\nof all savages, useful slaves. The men fight, hunt, take care of the\r\nhorses, and\r\nmake the riding gear. One of their chief indoor occupations is to knock\r\ntwo stones together till they become round, in order to make the bolas.\r\nWith this important weapon the Indian catches his game, and also his\r\nhorse, which roams free over the plain. In fighting, his first attempt\r\nis to throw down the horse of his adversary with the bolas, and when\r\nentangled by the fall to kill him with the chuzo. If the balls only\r\ncatch the neck or body of an animal, they are often carried away and\r\nlost. As the making the stones round is the labour of two days, the\r\nmanufacture of the balls is a very common employment. Several of the\r\nmen and women had their faces painted red, but I never saw the\r\nhorizontal bands which are so common among the Fuegians. Their chief\r\npride consists in having everything made of silver; I have seen a\r\ncacique with his spurs, stirrups, handle of his knife, and bridle made\r\nof this metal: the head-stall and reins being of wire, were not thicker\r\nthan whipcord; and to see a fiery steed wheeling about under the\r\ncommand of so light a chain, gave to the horsemanship a remarkable\r\ncharacter of elegance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nGeneral Rosas intimated a wish to see me; a circumstance which I was\r\nafterwards very glad of. He is a man of an extraordinary character, and\r\nhas a most predominant influence in the country, which it seems\r\nprobable he will use\r\nto its prosperity and advancement.[6] He is said to be the owner of\r\nseventy-four square leagues of land, and to have about three hundred\r\nthousand head of cattle. His estates are admirably managed, and are far\r\nmore productive of corn than those of others. He first gained his\r\ncelebrity by his laws for his own estancias, and by disciplining\r\nseveral hundred men, so as to resist with success the attacks of the\r\nIndians. There are many stories current about the rigid manner in which\r\nhis laws were enforced. One of these was, that no man, on penalty of\r\nbeing put into the stocks, should carry his knife on a Sunday: this\r\nbeing the principal day for gambling and drinking, many quarrels arose,\r\nwhich from the general manner of fighting with the knife often proved\r\nfatal.\r\n\r\n [6] This prophecy has turned out entirely and miserably wrong. 1845.\r\n\r\nOne Sunday the Governor came in great form to pay the estancia a visit,\r\nand General Rosas, in his hurry, walked out to receive him with his\r\nknife, as usual, stuck in his belt. The steward touched his arm, and\r\nreminded him of the law; upon which turning to the Governor, he said he\r\nwas extremely sorry, but that he must go into the stocks, and that till\r\nlet out, he possessed no power even in his own house. After a little\r\ntime the steward was persuaded to open the stocks, and to let him out,\r\nbut no sooner was this done, than he turned to the steward and said,\r\n“You now have broken the laws, so you must take my place in the\r\nstocks.” Such actions as these delighted the Gauchos, who all possess\r\nhigh notions of their own equality and dignity.\r\n\r\nGeneral Rosas is also a perfect horseman—an accomplishment of no small\r\nconsequence in a country where an assembled army elected its general by\r\nthe following trial: A troop of unbroken horses being driven into a\r\ncorral, were let out through a gateway, above which was a cross-bar: it\r\nwas agreed whoever should drop from the bar on one of these wild\r\nanimals, as it rushed out, and should be able, without saddle or\r\nbridle, not only to ride it, but also to bring it back to the door of\r\nthe corral, should be their general. The person who succeeded was\r\naccordingly elected; and doubtless made a fit general for such an army.\r\nThis extraordinary feat has also been performed by Rosas.\r\n\r\nBy these means, and by conforming to the dress and habits\r\nof the Gauchos, he has obtained an unbounded popularity in the country,\r\nand in consequence a despotic power. I was assured by an English\r\nmerchant, that a man who had murdered another, when arrested and\r\nquestioned concerning his motive, answered, “He spoke disrespectfully\r\nof General Rosas, so I killed him.” At the end of a week the murderer\r\nwas at liberty. This doubtless was the act of the general’s party, and\r\nnot of the general himself.\r\n\r\nIn conversation he is enthusiastic, sensible, and very grave. His\r\ngravity is carried to a high pitch: I heard one of his mad buffoons\r\n(for he keeps two, like the barons of old) relate the following\r\nanecdote. “I wanted very much to hear a certain piece of music, so I\r\nwent to the general two or three times to ask him; he said to me, ‘Go\r\nabout your business, for I am engaged.’ I went a second time; he said,\r\n‘If you come again I will punish you.’ A third time I asked, and he\r\nlaughed. I rushed out of the tent, but it was too late—he ordered two\r\nsoldiers to catch and stake me. I begged by all the saints in heaven he\r\nwould let me off; but it would not do,—when the general laughs he\r\nspares neither mad man nor sound.” The poor flighty gentleman looked\r\nquite dolorous, at the very recollection of the staking. This is a very\r\nsevere punishment; four posts are driven into the ground, and the man\r\nis extended by his arms and legs horizontally, and there left to\r\nstretch for several hours. The idea is evidently taken from the usual\r\nmethod of drying hides. My interview passed away without a smile, and I\r\nobtained a passport and order for the government post-horses, and this\r\nhe gave me in the most obliging and ready manner.\r\n\r\nIn the morning we started for Bahia Blanca, which we reached in two\r\ndays. Leaving the regular encampment, we passed by the toldos of the\r\nIndians. These are round like ovens, and covered with hides; by the\r\nmouth of each, a tapering chuzo was stuck in the ground. The toldos\r\nwere divided into separate groups, which belonged to the different\r\ncaciques’ tribes, and the groups were again divided into smaller ones,\r\naccording to the relationship of the owners. For several miles we\r\ntravelled along the valley of the Colorado. The alluvial plains on the\r\nside appeared fertile, and it is supposed that they are well adapted to\r\nthe growth of corn.\r\n\r\n\r\nTurning northward from the river, we soon entered on a country,\r\ndiffering from the plains south of the river. The land still continued\r\ndry and sterile: but it supported many different kinds of plants, and\r\nthe grass, though brown and withered, was more abundant, as the thorny\r\nbushes were less so. These latter in a short space entirely\r\ndisappeared, and the plains were left without a thicket to cover their\r\nnakedness. This change in the vegetation marks the commencement of the\r\ngrand calcareo-argillaceous deposit, which forms the wide extent of the\r\nPampas, and covers the granitic rocks of Banda Oriental. From the\r\nStrait of Magellan to the Colorado, a distance of about eight hundred\r\nmiles, the face of the country is everywhere composed of shingle: the\r\npebbles are chiefly of porphyry, and probably owe their origin to the\r\nrocks of the Cordillera. North of the Colorado this bed thins out, and\r\nthe pebbles become exceedingly small, and here the characteristic\r\nvegetation of Patagonia ceases.\r\n\r\nHaving ridden about twenty-five miles, we came to a broad belt of\r\nsand-dunes, which stretches, as far as the eye can reach, to the east\r\nand west. The sand-hillocks resting on the clay, allow small pools of\r\nwater to collect, and thus afford in this dry country an invaluable\r\nsupply of fresh water. The great advantage arising from depressions and\r\nelevations of the soil, is not often brought home to the mind. The two\r\nmiserable springs in the long passage between the Rio Negro and\r\nColorado were caused by trifling inequalities in the plain, without\r\nthem not a drop of water would have been found. The belt of sand-dunes\r\nis about eight miles wide; at some former period, it probably formed\r\nthe margin of a grand estuary, where the Colorado now flows. In this\r\ndistrict, where absolute proofs of the recent elevation of the land\r\noccur, such speculations can hardly be neglected by any one, although\r\nmerely considering the physical geography of the country. Having\r\ncrossed the sandy tract, we arrived in the evening at one of the\r\npost-houses; and, as the fresh horses were grazing at a distance we\r\ndetermined to pass the night there.\r\n\r\nThe house was situated at the base of a ridge between one and two\r\nhundred feet high—a most remarkable feature in this country. This posta\r\nwas commanded by a negro lieutenant,\r\nborn in Africa: to his credit be it said, there was not a ranche\r\nbetween the Colorado and Buenos Ayres in nearly such neat order as his.\r\nHe had a little room for strangers, and a small corral for the horses,\r\nall made of sticks and reeds; he had also dug a ditch round his house\r\nas a defence in case of being attacked. This would, however, have been\r\nof little avail, if the Indians had come; but his chief comfort seemed\r\nto rest in the thought of selling his life dearly. A short time before,\r\na body of Indians had travelled past in the night; if they had been\r\naware of the posta, our black friend and his four soldiers would\r\nassuredly have been slaughtered. I did not anywhere meet a more civil\r\nand obliging man than this negro; it was therefore the more painful to\r\nsee that he would not sit down and eat with us.\r\n\r\nIn the morning we sent for the horses very early, and started for\r\nanother exhilarating gallop. We passed the Cabeza del Buey, an old name\r\ngiven to the head of a large marsh, which extends from Bahia Blanca.\r\nHere we changed horses, and passed through some leagues of swamps and\r\nsaline marshes. Changing horses for the last time, we again began\r\nwading through the mud. My animal fell, and I was well soused in black\r\nmire—a very disagreeable accident, when one does not possess a change\r\nof clothes. Some miles from the fort we met a man, who told us that a\r\ngreat gun had been fired, which is a signal that Indians are near. We\r\nimmediately left the road, and followed the edge of a marsh, which when\r\nchased offers the best mode of escape. We were glad to arrive within\r\nthe walls, when we found all the alarm was about nothing, for the\r\nIndians turned out to be friendly ones, who wished to join General\r\nRosas.\r\n\r\nBahia Blanca scarcely deserves the name of a village. A few houses and\r\nthe barracks for the troops are enclosed by a deep ditch and fortified\r\nwall. The settlement is only of recent standing (since 1828); and its\r\ngrowth has been one of trouble. The government of Buenos Ayres unjustly\r\noccupied it by force, instead of following the wise example of the\r\nSpanish Viceroys, who purchased the land near the older settlement of\r\nthe Rio Negro, from the Indians. Hence the need of the fortifications;\r\nhence the few houses and little cultivated land without the limits of\r\nthe walls; even the cattle are not safe from the\r\nattacks of the Indians beyond the boundaries of the plain on which the\r\nfortress stands.\r\n\r\nThe part of the harbour where the _Beagle_ intended to anchor being\r\ndistant twenty-five miles, I obtained from the Commandant a guide and\r\nhorses, to take me to see whether she had arrived. Leaving the plain of\r\ngreen turf, which extended along the course of a little brook, we soon\r\nentered on a wide level waste consisting either of sand, saline\r\nmarshes, or bare mud. Some parts were clothed by low thickets, and\r\nothers with those succulent plants which luxuriate only where salt\r\nabounds. Bad as the country was, ostriches, deers, agoutis, and\r\narmadilloes, were abundant. My guide told me, that two months before he\r\nhad a most narrow escape of his life: he was out hunting with two other\r\nmen, at no great distance from this part of the country, when they were\r\nsuddenly met by a party of Indians, who giving chase, soon overtook and\r\nkilled his two friends. His own horse’s legs were also caught by the\r\nbolas, but he jumped off, and with his knife cut them free: while doing\r\nthis he was obliged to dodge round his horse, and received two severe\r\nwounds from their chuzos. Springing on the saddle, he managed, by a\r\nmost wonderful exertion, just to keep ahead of the long spears of his\r\npursuers, who followed him to within sight of the fort. From that time\r\nthere was an order that no one should stray far from the settlement. I\r\ndid not know of this when I started, and was surprised to observe how\r\nearnestly my guide watched a deer, which appeared to have been\r\nfrightened from a distant quarter.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe found the _Beagle_ had not arrived, and consequently set out on our\r\nreturn, but the horses soon tiring, we were obliged to bivouac on the\r\nplain. In the morning we had caught an armadillo, which, although a\r\nmost excellent dish when roasted in its shell, did not make a very\r\nsubstantial breakfast and dinner for two hungry men. The ground at the\r\nplace where we stopped for the night was incrusted with a layer of\r\nsulphate of soda, and hence, of course, was without water. Yet many of\r\nthe smaller rodents managed to exist even here, and the tucutuco was\r\nmaking its odd little grunt beneath my head, during half the night. Our\r\nhorses were very poor ones, and in\r\nthe morning they were soon exhausted from not having had anything to\r\ndrink, so that we were obliged to walk. About noon the dogs killed a\r\nkid, which we roasted. I ate some of it, but it made me intolerably\r\nthirsty. This was the more distressing as the road, from some recent\r\nrain, was full of little puddles of clear water, yet not a drop was\r\ndrinkable. I had scarcely been twenty hours without water, and only\r\npart of the time under a hot sun, yet the thirst rendered me very weak.\r\nHow people survive two or three days under such circumstances, I cannot\r\nimagine: at the same time, I must confess that my guide did not suffer\r\nat all, and was astonished that one day’s deprivation should be so\r\ntroublesome to me.\r\n\r\nI have several times alluded to the surface of the ground being\r\nincrusted with salt. This phenomenon is quite different from that of\r\nthe salinas, and more extraordinary. In many parts of South America,\r\nwherever the climate is moderately dry, these incrustations occur; but\r\nI have nowhere seen them so abundant as near Bahia Blanca. The salt\r\nhere, and in other parts of Patagonia, consists chiefly of sulphate of\r\nsoda with some common salt. As long as the ground remains moist in the\r\nsalitrales (as the Spaniards improperly call them, mistaking this\r\nsubstance for saltpetre), nothing is to be seen but an extensive plain\r\ncomposed of a black, muddy soil, supporting scattered tufts of\r\nsucculent plants. On returning through one of these tracts, after a\r\nweek’s hot weather, one is surprised to see square miles of the plain\r\nwhite, as if from a slight fall of snow, here and there heaped up by\r\nthe wind into little drifts. This latter appearance is chiefly caused\r\nby the salts being drawn up, during the slow evaporation of the\r\nmoisture, round blades of dead grass, stumps of wood, and pieces of\r\nbroken earth, instead of being crystallised at the bottoms of the\r\npuddles of water.\r\n\r\nThe salitrales occur either on level tracts elevated only a few feet\r\nabove the level of the sea, or on alluvial land bordering rivers. M.\r\nParchappe[7] found that the saline incrustation on the plain, at the\r\ndistance of some miles from the sea, consisted chiefly of sulphate of\r\nsoda, with only seven per cent of common salt; whilst nearer to the\r\ncoast, the\r\ncommon salt increased to 37 parts in a hundred. This circumstance would\r\ntempt one to believe that the sulphate of soda is generated in the\r\nsoil, from the muriate left on the surface during the slow and recent\r\nelevation of this dry country. The whole phenomenon is well worthy the\r\nattention of naturalists. Have the succulent, salt-loving plants, which\r\nare well known to contain much soda, the power of decomposing the\r\nmuriate? Does the black fetid mud, abounding with organic matter, yield\r\nthe sulphur and ultimately the sulphuric acid?\r\n\r\n [7] _Voyage dans l’Amérique Mérid._ par M. A. d’Orbigny. Part. Hist.,\r\n tome i, p. 664.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo days afterwards I again rode to the harbour: when not far from our\r\ndestination, my companion, the same man as before, spied three people\r\nhunting on horseback. He immediately dismounted, and watching them\r\nintently, said, “They don’t ride like Christians, and nobody can leave\r\nthe fort.” The three hunters joined company, and likewise dismounted\r\nfrom their horses. At last one mounted again and rode over the hill out\r\nof sight. My companion said, “We must now get on our horses: load your\r\npistol;” and he looked to his own sword. I asked, “Are they\r\nIndians?”—“Quien sabe? (who knows?) if there are no more than three, it\r\ndoes not signify.” It then struck me, that the one man had gone over\r\nthe hill to fetch the rest of his tribe. I suggested this; but all the\r\nanswer I could extort was, “Quien sabe?” His head and eye never for a\r\nminute ceased scanning slowly the distant horizon. I thought his\r\nuncommon coolness too good a joke, and asked him why he did not return\r\nhome. I was startled when he answered, “We are returning, but in a line\r\nso as to pass near a swamp, into which we can gallop the horses as far\r\nas they can go, and then trust to our own legs; so that there is no\r\ndanger.” I did not feel quite so confident of this, and wanted to\r\nincrease our pace. He said, “No, not until they do.” When any little\r\ninequality concealed us, we galloped; but when in sight, continued\r\nwalking. At last we reached a valley, and turning to the left, galloped\r\nquickly to the foot of a hill; he gave me his horse to hold, made the\r\ndogs lie down, and then crawled on his hands and knees to reconnoitre.\r\nHe remained in this position for some time, and at last, bursting out\r\nin laughter, exclaimed, “Mugeres!” (women!) He knew\r\nthem to be the wife and sister-in-law of the major’s son, hunting for\r\nostrich’s eggs.\r\n\r\nI have described this man’s conduct, because he acted under the full\r\nimpression that they were Indians. As soon, however, as the absurd\r\nmistake was found out, he gave me a hundred reasons why they could not\r\nhave been Indians; but all these were forgotten at the time. We then\r\nrode on in peace and quietness to a low point called Punta Alta, whence\r\nwe could see nearly the whole of the great harbour of Bahia Blanca.\r\n\r\nThe wide expanse of water is choked up by numerous great mudbanks,\r\nwhich the inhabitants call Cangrejales, or _ crabberies_, from the\r\nnumber of small crabs. The mud is so soft that it is impossible to walk\r\nover them, even for the shortest distance. Many of the banks have their\r\nsurfaces covered with long rushes, the tops of which alone are visible\r\nat high water. On one occasion, when in a boat, we were so entangled by\r\nthese shallows that we could hardly find our way. Nothing was visible\r\nbut the flat beds of mud; the day was not very clear, and there was\r\nmuch refraction, or, as the sailors expressed it, “things loomed high.”\r\nThe only object within our view which was not level was the horizon;\r\nrushes looked like bushes unsupported in the air, and water like\r\nmudbanks, and mudbanks like water.\r\n\r\nWe passed the night in Punta Alta, and I employed myself in searching\r\nfor fossil bones; this point being a perfect catacomb for monsters of\r\nextinct races. The evening was perfectly calm and clear; the extreme\r\nmonotony of the view gave it an interest even in the midst of mudbanks\r\nand gulls, sand-hillocks and solitary vultures. In riding back in the\r\nmorning we came across a very fresh track of a Puma, but did not\r\nsucceed in finding it. We saw also a couple of Zorillos, or\r\nskunks,—odious animals, which are far from uncommon. In general\r\nappearance the Zorillo resembles a polecat, but it is rather larger,\r\nand much thicker in proportion. Conscious of its power, it roams by day\r\nabout the open plain, and fears neither dog nor man. If a dog is urged\r\nto the attack, its courage is instantly checked by a few drops of the\r\nfetid oil, which brings on violent sickness and running at the nose.\r\nWhatever is once polluted by it, is for ever useless. Azara\r\nsays the smell can be perceived at a league distant; more than once,\r\nwhen entering the harbour of Monte Video, the wind being off shore, we\r\nhave perceived the odour on board the _Beagle._ Certain it is, that\r\nevery animal most willingly makes room for the Zorillo.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter V\r\n\r\n\r\nBahia Blanca—Geology—Numerous gigantic extinct Quadrupeds—Recent\r\nExtinction—Longevity of Species—Large Animals do not require a\r\nluxuriant Vegetation—Southern Africa—Siberian Fossils—Two Species of\r\nOstrich—Habits of Oven-bird—Armadilloes—Venomous Snake, Toad,\r\nLizard—Hybernation of Animals—Habits of Sea-Pen—Indian Wars and\r\nMassacres—Arrowhead, antiquarian Relic.\r\n\r\nBAHIA BLANCA.\r\n\r\nThe _Beagle_ arrived here on the 24th of August, and a week afterwards\r\nsailed for the Plata. With Captain Fitz Roy’s consent I was left\r\nbehind, to travel by land to Buenos Ayres. I will here add some\r\nobservations, which were made during this visit and on a previous\r\noccasion, when the _Beagle_ was employed in surveying the harbour.\r\n\r\nThe plain, at the distance of a few miles from the coast,\r\nbelongs to the great Pampean formation, which consists in part of a\r\nreddish clay, and in part of a highly calcareous marly rock. Nearer the\r\ncoast there are some plains formed from the wreck of the upper plain,\r\nand from mud, gravel, and sand thrown up by the sea during the slow\r\nelevation of the land, of which elevation we have evidence in upraised\r\nbeds of recent shells, and in rounded pebbles of pumice scattered over\r\nthe country. At Punta Alta we have a section of one of these\r\nlater-formed little plains, which is highly interesting from the number\r\nand extraordinary character of the remains of gigantic land-animals\r\nembedded in it. These have been fully described by Professor Owen, in\r\nthe _Zoology of the Voyage of the Beagle_, and are deposited in the\r\nCollege of Surgeons. I will here give only a brief outline of their\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nFirst, parts of three heads and other bones of the Megatherium, the\r\nhuge dimensions of which are expressed by its name. Secondly, the\r\nMegalonyx, a great allied animal. Thirdly, the Scelidotherium, also an\r\nallied animal, of which I obtained a nearly perfect skeleton. It must\r\nhave been as large as a rhinoceros: in the structure of its head it\r\ncomes, according to Mr. Owen, nearest to the Cape Ant-eater, but in\r\nsome other respects it approaches to the armadilloes. Fourthly, the\r\nMylodon Darwinii, a closely related genus of little inferior size.\r\nFifthly, another gigantic edental quadruped. Sixthly, a large animal,\r\nwith an osseous coat in compartments, very like that of an armadillo.\r\nSeventhly, an extinct kind of horse, to which I shall have again to\r\nrefer. Eighthly, a tooth of a Pachydermatous animal, probably the same\r\nwith the Macrauchenia, a huge beast with a long neck like a camel,\r\nwhich I shall also refer to again. Lastly, the Toxodon, perhaps one of\r\nthe strangest animals ever discovered: in size it equalled an elephant\r\nor megatherium, but the structure of its teeth, as Mr. Owen states,\r\nproves indisputably that it was intimately related to the Gnawers, the\r\norder which, at the present day, includes most of the smallest\r\nquadrupeds: in many details it is allied to the Pachydermata: judging\r\nfrom the position of its eyes, ears, and nostrils, it was probably\r\naquatic, like the Dugong and Manatee, to which it is also allied. How\r\nwonderfully are the different Orders, at the present time so well\r\nseparated, blended together in different points of the structure of the\r\nToxodon!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe remains of these nine great quadrupeds and many detached bones were\r\nfound embedded on the beach, within the space of about 200 yards\r\nsquare. It is a remarkable circumstance that so many different species\r\nshould be found together; and it proves how numerous in kind the\r\nancient inhabitants of this country must have been. At the distance of\r\nabout thirty miles from Punta Alta, in a cliff of red earth, I found\r\nseveral fragments of bones, some of large size. Among them were the\r\nteeth of a gnawer, equalling in size and closely resembling those of\r\nthe Capybara, whose habits have been described; and therefore,\r\nprobably, an aquatic animal. There was also part of the head of a\r\nCtenomys; the species being different from the Tucutuco, but with a\r\nclose general resemblance. The red earth, like that of the Pampas, in\r\nwhich these remains were embedded, contains, according to Professor\r\nEhrenberg, eight fresh-water and one salt-water infusorial animalcule;\r\ntherefore, probably, it was an estuary deposit.\r\n\r\nThe remains at Punta Alta were embedded in stratified gravel and\r\nreddish mud, just such as the sea might now wash up on a shallow bank.\r\nThey were associated with twenty-three species of shells, of which\r\nthirteen are recent and four others very closely related to recent\r\nforms.[1] From the bones of the Scelidotherium, including even the\r\nkneecap, being entombed in their proper relative positions,[2] and from\r\nthe osseous armour of the great armadillo-like animal being so well\r\npreserved, together with the bones of one of its legs, we may feel\r\nassured that these remains were fresh and united by their ligaments,\r\nwhen deposited in the gravel together with the shells. Hence we have\r\ngood evidence that the above enumerated gigantic quadrupeds, more\r\ndifferent from those of the present day than the oldest of the tertiary\r\nquadrupeds of Europe, lived whilst the sea was peopled with most of its\r\npresent inhabitants; and we have confirmed that remarkable law so often\r\ninsisted on by Mr. Lyell, namely, that the “longevity of the species in\r\nthe mammalia is upon the whole inferior to that of the testacea.”[3]\r\n\r\n [1] Since this was written, M. Alcide d’Orbigny has examined these\r\n shells, and pronounces them all to be recent.\r\n\r\n\r\n [2] M. Aug. Bravard has described, in a Spanish work (_Observaciones\r\n Geologicas_, 1857), this district, and he believes that the bones of\r\n the extinct mammals were washed out of the underlying Pampean deposit,\r\n and subsequently became embedded with the still existing shells; but I\r\n am not convinced by his remarks. M. Bravard believes that the whole\r\n enormous Pampean deposit is a sub-aerial formation, like sand-dunes:\r\n this seems to me to be an untenable doctrine.\r\n\r\n\r\n [3] _Principles of Geology_, vol. iv, p. 40.\r\n\r\nThe great size of the bones of the Megatheroid animals, including the\r\nMegatherium, Megalonyx, Scelidotherium, and Mylodon, is truly\r\nwonderful. The habits of life of these animals were a complete puzzle\r\nto naturalists, until Professor Owen[4] solved the problem with\r\nremarkable ingenuity. The teeth indicate, by their simple structure,\r\nthat these Megatheroid animals lived on vegetable food, and probably on\r\nthe leaves and small twigs of trees; their ponderous forms and great\r\nstrong curved claws seem so little adapted for locomotion, that some\r\neminent naturalists have actually believed that, like the sloths, to\r\nwhich they are intimately related, they subsisted by climbing back\r\ndownwards on trees, and feeding on the leaves. It was a bold, not to\r\nsay preposterous, idea to conceive even antediluvian trees, with\r\nbranches strong enough to bear animals as large as elephants. Professor\r\nOwen, with far more probability, believes that, instead of climbing on\r\nthe trees, they pulled the branches down to them, and tore up the\r\nsmaller ones by the roots, and so fed on the leaves. The colossal\r\nbreadth and weight of their hinder quarters, which can hardly be\r\nimagined without having been seen, become, on this view, of obvious\r\nservice, instead of being an encumbrance: their apparent clumsiness\r\ndisappears. With their great tails and their huge heels firmly fixed\r\nlike a tripod on the ground, they could freely exert the full force of\r\ntheir most powerful arms and great claws. Strongly rooted, indeed, must\r\nthat tree have been, which could have resisted such force! The Mylodon,\r\nmoreover, was furnished with a long extensile tongue like that of the\r\ngiraffe, which, by one of those beautiful provisions of nature, thus\r\nreaches with the aid of its long neck its leafy food. I may remark,\r\nthat in Abyssinia the elephant, according to Bruce, when it cannot\r\nreach with its proboscis the branches, deeply scores with its tusks the\r\ntrunk of the tree, up and down and all round, till it is sufficiently\r\nweakened to be broken down.\r\n\r\n [4] This theory was first developed in the _Zoology of the Voyage of\r\n the Beagle_, and subsequently in Professor Owen’s _Memoir on Mylodon\r\n robustus._\r\n\r\nThe beds including the above fossil remains stand only from fifteen to\r\ntwenty feet above the level of high water; and hence\r\nthe elevation of the land has been small (without there has been an\r\nintercalated period of subsidence, of which we have no evidence) since\r\nthe great quadrupeds wandered over the surrounding plains; and the\r\nexternal features of the country must then have been very nearly the\r\nsame as now. What, it may naturally be asked, was the character of the\r\nvegetation at that period; was the country as wretchedly sterile as it\r\nnow is? As so many of the co-embedded shells are the same with those\r\nnow living in the bay, I was at first inclined to think that the former\r\nvegetation was probably similar to the existing one; but this would\r\nhave been an erroneous inference, for some of these same shells live on\r\nthe luxuriant coast of Brazil; and generally, the characters of the\r\ninhabitants of the sea are useless as guides to judge of those on the\r\nland. Nevertheless, from the following considerations, I do not believe\r\nthat the simple fact of many gigantic quadrupeds having lived on the\r\nplains round Bahia Blanca, is any sure guide that they formerly were\r\nclothed with a luxuriant vegetation: I have no doubt that the sterile\r\ncountry a little southward, near the Rio Negro, with its scattered\r\nthorny trees, would support many and large quadrupeds.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat large animals require a luxuriant vegetation, has been a general\r\nassumption which has passed from one work to another; but I do not\r\nhesitate to say that it is completely false, and that it has vitiated\r\nthe reasoning of geologists on some points of great interest in the\r\nancient history of the world. The prejudice has probably been derived\r\nfrom India, and the Indian islands, where troops of elephants, noble\r\nforests, and impenetrable jungles, are associated together in every\r\none’s mind. If, however, we refer to any work of travels through the\r\nsouthern parts of Africa, we shall find allusions in almost every page\r\neither to the desert character of the country, or to the numbers of\r\nlarge animals inhabiting it. The same thing is rendered evident by the\r\nmany engravings which have been published of various parts of the\r\ninterior. When the _ Beagle_ was at Cape Town, I made an excursion of\r\nsome days’ length into the country, which at least was sufficient to\r\nrender that which I had read more fully intelligible.\r\n\r\nDr. Andrew Smith, who, at the head of his adventurous party, has lately\r\nsucceeded in passing the Tropic of Capricorn,\r\ninforms me that, taking into consideration the whole of the southern\r\npart of Africa, there can be no doubt of its being a sterile country.\r\nOn the southern and south-eastern coasts there are some fine forests,\r\nbut with these exceptions, the traveller may pass for days together\r\nthrough open plains, covered by a poor and scanty vegetation. It is\r\ndifficult to convey any accurate idea of degrees of comparative\r\nfertility; but it may be safely said that the amount of vegetation\r\nsupported at any one time[5] by Great Britain, exceeds, perhaps even\r\ntenfold, the quantity on an equal area in the interior parts of\r\nSouthern Africa. The fact that bullock-waggons can travel in any\r\ndirection, excepting near the coast, without more than occasionally\r\nhalf an hour’s delay in cutting down bushes, gives, perhaps, a more\r\ndefinite notion of the scantiness of the vegetation. Now, if we look to\r\nthe animals inhabiting these wide plains, we shall find their numbers\r\nextraordinarily great, and their bulk immense. We must enumerate the\r\nelephant, three species of rhinoceros, and probably, according to Dr.\r\nSmith, two others, the hippopotamus, the giraffe, the bos caffer—as\r\nlarge as a full-grown bull, and the elan—but little less, two zebras,\r\nand the quaccha, two gnus, and several antelopes even larger than these\r\nlatter animals. It may be supposed that although the species are\r\nnumerous, the individuals of each kind are few. By the kindness of Dr.\r\nSmith, I am enabled to show that the case is very different. He informs\r\nme, that in lat. 24°, in one day’s march with the bullock-waggons, he\r\nsaw, without wandering to any great distance on either side, between\r\none hundred and one hundred and fifty rhinoceroses, which belonged to\r\nthree species: the same day he saw several herds of giraffes, amounting\r\ntogether to nearly a hundred; and that, although no elephant was\r\nobserved, yet they are found in this district. At the distance of a\r\nlittle more than one hour’s march from their place of encampment on the\r\nprevious night, his party actually killed at one spot eight\r\nhippopotamuses, and saw many more. In this same river there were\r\nlikewise crocodiles. Of course it was a case quite extraordinary, to\r\nsee so many great animals crowded together, but it evidently proves\r\nthat they must exist in great numbers. Dr. Smith describes the country\r\npassed through that day, as “being\r\nthinly covered with grass, and bushes about four feet high, and still\r\nmore thinly with mimosa-trees.” The waggons were not prevented\r\ntravelling in a nearly straight line.\r\n\r\n [5] I mean by this to exclude the total amount which may have been\r\n successively produced and consumed during a given period.\r\n\r\nBesides these large animals, every one the least acquainted with the\r\nnatural history of the Cape has read of the herds of antelopes, which\r\ncan be compared only with the flocks of migratory birds. The numbers\r\nindeed of the lion, panther, and hyæna, and the multitude of birds of\r\nprey, plainly speak of the abundance of the smaller quadrupeds: one\r\nevening seven lions were counted at the same time prowling round Dr.\r\nSmith’s encampment. As this able naturalist remarked to me, the carnage\r\neach day in Southern Africa must indeed be terrific! I confess it is\r\ntruly surprising how such a number of animals can find support in a\r\ncountry producing so little food. The larger quadrupeds no doubt roam\r\nover wide tracts in search of it; and their food chiefly consists of\r\nunderwood, which probably contains much nutriment in a small bulk. Dr.\r\nSmith also informs me that the vegetation has a rapid growth; no sooner\r\nis a part consumed, than its place is supplied by a fresh stock. There\r\ncan be no doubt, however, that our ideas respecting the apparent amount\r\nof food necessary for the support of large quadrupeds are much\r\nexaggerated: it should have been remembered that the camel, an animal\r\nof no mean bulk, has always been considered as the emblem of the\r\ndesert.\r\n\r\nThe belief that where large quadrupeds exist, the vegetation must\r\nnecessarily be luxuriant, is the more remarkable, because the converse\r\nis far from true. Mr. Burchell observed to me that when entering\r\nBrazil, nothing struck him more forcibly than the splendour of the\r\nSouth American vegetation contrasted with that of South Africa,\r\ntogether with the absence of all large quadrupeds. In his _Travels_,[6]\r\nhe has suggested that the comparison of the respective weights (if\r\nthere were sufficient data) of an equal number of the largest\r\nherbivorous quadrupeds of each country would be extremely curious. If\r\nwe take on the one side, the elephant,[7] hippopotamus, giraffe, bos\r\ncaffer,\r\nelan, certainly three, and probably five species of rhinoceros; and on\r\nthe American side, two tapirs, the guanaco, three deer, the vicuna,\r\npeccari, capybara (after which we must choose from the monkeys to\r\ncomplete the number), and then place these two groups alongside each\r\nother, it is not easy to conceive ranks more disproportionate in size.\r\nAfter the above facts, we are compelled to conclude, against anterior\r\nprobability,[8] that among the mammalia there exists no close relation\r\nbetween the _bulk_ of the species and the _quantity_ of the vegetation\r\nin the countries which they inhabit.\r\n\r\n [6] _Travels in the Interior of South Africa_, vol. ii, p. 207.\r\n\r\n\r\n [7] The elephant which was killed at Exeter Change was estimated\r\n (being partly weighed) at five tons and a half. The elephant actress,\r\n as I was informed, weighed one ton less; so that we may take five as\r\n the average of a full-grown elephant. I was told at the Surry Gardens,\r\n that a hippopotamus which was sent to England cut up into pieces was\r\n estimated at three tons and a half; we will call it three. From these\r\n premises we may give three tons and a half to each of the five\r\n rhinoceroses; perhaps a ton to the giraffe, and half to the bos caffer\r\n as well as to the elan (a large ox weighs from 1200 to 1500 pounds).\r\n This will give an average (from the above estimates) of 2.7 of a ton\r\n for the ten largest herbivorous animals of Southern Africa. In South\r\n America, allowing 1200 pounds for the two tapirs together, 550 for the\r\n guanaco and vicuna, 500 for three deer, 300 for the capybara, peccari,\r\n and a monkey, we shall have an average of 250 pounds, which I believe\r\n is overstating the result. The ratio will therefore be as 6048 to 250,\r\n or 24 to 1, for the ten largest animals from the two continents.\r\n\r\n\r\n [8] If we suppose the case of the discovery of a skeleton of a\r\n Greenland whale in a fossil state, not a single cetaceous animal being\r\n known to exist, what naturalist would have ventured conjecture on the\r\n possibility of a carcass so gigantic being supported on the minute\r\n crustacea and mollusca living in the frozen seas of the extreme North?\r\n\r\nWith regard to the number of large quadrupeds, there certainly exists\r\nno quarter of the globe which will bear comparison with Southern\r\nAfrica. After the different statements which have been given, the\r\nextremely desert character of that region will not be disputed. In the\r\nEuropean division of the world, we must look back to the tertiary\r\nepochs, to find a condition of things among the mammalia, resembling\r\nthat now existing at the Cape of Good Hope. Those tertiary epochs,\r\nwhich we are apt to consider as abounding to an astonishing degree with\r\nlarge animals, because we find the remains of many ages accumulated at\r\ncertain spots, could hardly boast of more large quadrupeds than\r\nSouthern Africa does at present. If we speculate on the condition of\r\nthe vegetation during those epochs, we are at least bound so far to\r\nconsider existing analogies, as not to urge as absolutely necessary a\r\nluxuriant vegetation, when we see a state of things so totally\r\ndifferent at the Cape of Good Hope.\r\n\r\nWe know[9] that the extreme regions of North America\r\nmany degrees beyond the limit where the ground at the depth of a few\r\nfeet remains perpetually congealed, are covered by forests of large and\r\ntall trees. In a like manner, in Siberia, we have woods of birch, fir,\r\naspen, and larch, growing in a latitude[10] (64°) where the mean\r\ntemperature of the air falls below the freezing point, and where the\r\nearth is so completely frozen, that the carcass of an animal embedded\r\nin it is perfectly preserved. With these facts we must grant, as far as\r\n_quantity alone_ of vegetation is concerned, that the great quadrupeds\r\nof the later tertiary epochs might, in most parts of Northern Europe\r\nand Asia, have lived on the spots where their remains are now found. I\r\ndo not here speak of the _kind_ of vegetation necessary for their\r\nsupport; because, as there is evidence of physical changes, and as the\r\nanimals have become extinct, so may we suppose that the species of\r\nplants have likewise been changed.\r\n\r\n [9] See _Zoological Remarks to Captain Back’s Expedition_, by Dr.\r\n Richardson. He says, “The subsoil north of latitude 56° is perpetually\r\n frozen, the thaw on the coast not penetrating above three feet, and at\r\n Bear Lake, in latitude 64°, not more than twenty inches. The frozen\r\n substratum does not of itself destroy vegetation, for forests flourish\r\n on the surface, at a distance from the coast.”\r\n\r\n\r\n [10] See Humboldt _Fragmens Asiatiques_, p. 386: Barton’s _Geography\r\n of Plants_; and Malte Brun. In the latter work it is said that the\r\n limit of the growth of trees in Siberia may be drawn under the\r\n parallel of 70°.\r\n\r\nThese remarks, I may be permitted to add, directly bear on the case of\r\nthe Siberian animals preserved in ice. The firm conviction of the\r\nnecessity of a vegetation possessing a character of tropical\r\nluxuriance, to support such large animals, and the impossibility of\r\nreconciling this with the proximity of perpetual congelation, was one\r\nchief cause of the several theories of sudden revolutions of climate,\r\nand of overwhelming catastrophes, which were invented to account for\r\ntheir entombment. I am far from supposing that the climate has not\r\nchanged since the period when those animals lived, which now lie buried\r\nin the ice. At present I only wish to show, that as far as _quantity_\r\nof food _alone_ is concerned, the ancient rhinoceroses might have\r\nroamed over the _steppes_ of central Siberia (the northern parts\r\nprobably being under water) even in their present condition, as well as\r\nthe living rhinoceroses and elephants over the _Karros_ of Southern\r\nAfrica.\r\n\r\n\r\nI will now give an account of the habits of some of the more\r\ninteresting birds which are common on the wild plains of Northern\r\nPatagonia: and first for the largest, or South\r\nAmerican ostrich. The ordinary habits of the ostrich are familiar to\r\nevery one. They live on vegetable matter, such as roots and grass; but\r\nat Bahia Blanca I have repeatedly seen three or four come down at low\r\nwater to the extensive mudbanks which are then dry, for the sake, as\r\nthe Gauchos say, of feeding on small fish. Although the ostrich in its\r\nhabits is so shy, wary, and solitary, and although so fleet in its\r\npace, it is caught without much difficulty by the Indian or Gaucho\r\narmed with the bolas. When several horsemen appear in a semicircle, it\r\nbecomes confounded, and does not know which way to escape. They\r\ngenerally prefer running against the wind; yet at the first start they\r\nexpand their wings, and like a vessel make all sail. On one fine hot\r\nday I saw several ostriches enter a bed of tall rushes, where they\r\nsquatted concealed, till quite closely approached. It is not generally\r\nknown that ostriches readily take to the water. Mr. King informs me\r\nthat at the Bay of San Blas, and at Port Valdes in Patagonia, he saw\r\nthese birds swimming several times from island to island. They ran into\r\nthe water both when driven down to a point, and likewise of their own\r\naccord when not frightened: the distance crossed was about two hundred\r\nyards. When swimming, very little of their bodies appear above water;\r\ntheir necks are extended a little forward, and their progress is slow.\r\nOn two occasions I saw some ostriches swimming across the Santa Cruz\r\nriver, where its course was about four hundred yards wide, and the\r\nstream rapid. Captain Sturt,[11] when descending the Murrumbidgee, in\r\nAustralia, saw two emus in the act of swimming.\r\n\r\n [11] Sturt’s _Travels_, vol. ii, p. 74.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of the country readily distinguish, even at a distance,\r\nthe cock bird from the hen. The former is larger and\r\ndarker-coloured,[12] and has a bigger head. The ostrich, I believe the\r\ncock, emits a singular, deep-toned, hissing note: when first I heard\r\nit, standing in the midst of some sand-hillocks, I thought it was made\r\nby some wild beast, for it is a sound that one cannot tell whence it\r\ncomes, or from how far distant. When we were at Bahia Blanca in the\r\nmonths of September and October, the eggs, in extraordinary numbers,\r\nwere found all\r\nover the country. They lie either scattered and single, in which case\r\nthey are never hatched, and are called by the Spaniards huachos; or\r\nthey are collected together into a shallow excavation, which forms the\r\nnest. Out of the four nests which I saw, three contained twenty-two\r\neggs each, and the fourth twenty-seven. In one day’s hunting on\r\nhorseback sixty-four eggs were found; forty-four of these were in two\r\nnests, and the remaining twenty, scattered huachos. The Gauchos\r\nunanimously affirm, and there is no reason to doubt their statement,\r\nthat the male bird alone hatches the eggs, and for some time afterwards\r\naccompanies the young. The cock when on the nest lies very close; I\r\nhave myself almost ridden over one. It is asserted that at such times\r\nthey are occasionally fierce, and even dangerous, and that they have\r\nbeen known to attack a man on horseback, trying to kick and leap on\r\nhim. My informer pointed out to me an old man, whom he had seen much\r\nterrified by one chasing him. I observe in Burchell’s _Travels in South\r\nAfrica_ that he remarks, “Having killed a male ostrich, and the\r\nfeathers being dirty, it was said by the Hottentots to be a nest bird.”\r\nI understand that the male emu in the Zoological Gardens takes charge\r\nof the nest: this habit, therefore, is common to the family.\r\n\r\n [12] A Gaucho assured me that he had once seen a snow-white or Albino\r\n variety, and that it was a most beautiful bird.\r\n\r\nThe Gauchos unanimously affirm that several females lay in one nest. I\r\nhave been positively told that four or five hen birds have been watched\r\nto go in the middle of the day, one after the other, to the same nest.\r\nI may add, also, that it is believed in Africa that two or more females\r\nlay in one nest.[13] Although this habit at first appears very strange,\r\nI think the cause may be explained in a simple manner. The number of\r\neggs in the nest varies from twenty to forty, and even to fifty; and\r\naccording to Azara, sometimes to seventy or eighty. Now although it is\r\nmost probable, from the number of eggs found in one district being so\r\nextraordinarily great in proportion to the parent birds, and likewise\r\nfrom the state of the ovarium of the hen, that she may in the course of\r\nthe season lay a large number, yet the time required must be very long.\r\nAzara states,[14] that a female in a state of domestication laid\r\nseventeen\r\neggs, each at the interval of three days one from another. If the hen\r\nwas obliged to hatch her own eggs, before the last was laid the first\r\nprobably would be addled; but if each laid a few eggs at successive\r\nperiods, in different nests, and several hens, as is stated to be the\r\ncase, combined together, then the eggs in one collection would be\r\nnearly of the same age. If the number of eggs in one of these nests is,\r\nas I believe, not greater on an average than the number laid by one\r\nfemale in the season, then there must be as many nests as females, and\r\neach cock bird will have its fair share of the labour of incubation;\r\nand that during a period when the females probably could not sit, from\r\nnot having finished laying.[15] I have before mentioned the great\r\nnumbers of huachos, or deserted eggs; so that in one day’s hunting\r\ntwenty were found in this state. It appears odd that so many should be\r\nwasted. Does it not arise from the difficulty of several females\r\nassociating together, and finding a male ready to undertake the office\r\nof incubation? It is evident that there must at first be some degree of\r\nassociation between at least two females; otherwise the eggs would\r\nremain scattered over the wide plains, at distances far too great to\r\nallow of the male collecting them into one nest: some authors have\r\nbelieved that the scattered eggs were deposited for the young birds to\r\nfeed on. This can hardly be the case in America, because the huachos,\r\nalthough often found addled and putrid, are generally whole.\r\n\r\n [13] Burchell’s _Travels_, vol. i, p. 280.\r\n\r\n\r\n [14] Azara, vol. iv, p. 173.\r\n\r\n\r\n [15] Lichtenstein, however, asserts (_Travels_, vol. ii, p. 25) that\r\n the hens begin sitting when they have laid ten or twelve eggs; and\r\n that they continue laying, I presume in another nest. This appears to\r\n me very improbable. He asserts that four or five hens associate for\r\n incubation with one cock, who sits only at night.\r\n\r\nWhen at the Rio Negro in Northern Patagonia, I repeatedly heard the\r\nGauchos talking of a very rare bird which they called Avestruz Petise.\r\nThey described it as being less than the common ostrich (which is there\r\nabundant), but with a very close general resemblance. They said its\r\ncolour was dark and mottled, and that its legs were shorter, and\r\nfeathered lower down than those of the common ostrich. It is more\r\neasily caught by the bolas than the other species. The few inhabitants\r\nwho had seen both kinds, affirmed they could distinguish them apart\r\nfrom a long distance. The eggs of the small species appeared, however,\r\nmore generally known; and it was remarked, with\r\nsurprise, that they were very little less than those of the Rhea but of\r\na slightly different form, and with a tinge of pale blue. This species\r\noccurs most rarely on the plains bordering the Rio Negro; but about a\r\ndegree and a half farther south they are tolerably abundant. When at\r\nPort Desire, in Patagonia (lat. 48°), Mr. Martens shot an ostrich; and\r\nI looked at it, forgetting at the moment, in the most unaccountable\r\nmanner, the whole subject of the Petises, and thought it was a not\r\nfull-grown bird of the common sort. It was cooked and eaten before my\r\nmemory returned. Fortunately the head, neck, legs, wings, many of the\r\nlarger feathers, and a large part of the skin, had been preserved; and\r\nfrom these a very nearly perfect specimen has been put together, and is\r\nnow exhibited in the museum of the Zoological Society. Mr. Gould, in\r\ndescribing this new species, has done me the honour of calling it after\r\nmy name.\r\n\r\nAmong the Patagonian Indians in the Strait of Magellan, we found a half\r\nIndian, who had lived some years with the tribe, but had been born in\r\nthe northern provinces. I asked him if he had ever heard of the\r\nAvestruz Petise. He answered by saying, “Why, there are none others in\r\nthese southern countries.” He informed me that the number of eggs in\r\nthe nest of the petise is considerably less than in that of the other\r\nkind, namely, not more than fifteen on an average, but he asserted that\r\nmore than one female deposited them. At Santa Cruz we saw several of\r\nthese birds. They were excessively wary: I think they could see a\r\nperson approaching when too far off to be distinguished themselves. In\r\nascending the river few were seen; but in our quiet and rapid descent\r\nmany, in pairs and by fours or fives, were observed. It was remarked\r\nthat this bird did not expand its wings, when first starting at full\r\nspeed, after the manner of the northern kind. In conclusion I may\r\nobserve that the Struthio rhea inhabits the country of La Plata as far\r\nas a little south of the Rio Negro in lat. 41°, and that the Struthio\r\nDarwinii takes its place in Southern Patagonia; the part about the Rio\r\nNegro being neutral territory. M. A. d’Orbigny,[16] when at the Rio\r\nNegro, made great exertions to\r\nprocure this bird, but never had the good fortune to succeed.\r\nDobrizhoffer[17] long ago was aware of there being two kinds of\r\nostriches, he says, “You must know, moreover, that Emus differ in size\r\nand habits in different tracts of land; for those that inhabit the\r\nplains of Buenos Ayres and Tucuman are larger, and have black, white\r\nand grey feathers; those near to the Strait of Magellan are smaller and\r\nmore beautiful, for their white feathers are tipped with black at the\r\nextremity, and their black ones in like manner terminate in white.”\r\n\r\n [16] When at the Rio Negro, we heard much of the indefatigable labours\r\n of this naturalist. M. Alcide d’Orbigny, during the years 1825 to\r\n 1833, traversed several large portions of South America, and has made\r\n a collection, and is now publishing the results on a scale of\r\n magnificence, which at once places himself in the list of American\r\n travellers second only to Humboldt.\r\n\r\n\r\n [17] _Account of the Abipones_,  A.D. 1749, vol. i, (English\r\n translation) p. 314.\r\n\r\n\r\nA very singular little bird, Tinochorus rumicivorus, is here common: in\r\nits habits and general appearance it nearly equally partakes of the\r\ncharacters, different as they are, of the quail and snipe. The\r\nTinochorus is found in the whole of southern South America, wherever\r\nthere are sterile plains, or open dry pasture land. It frequents in\r\npairs or small flocks the most desolate places, where scarcely another\r\nliving creature can exist. Upon being approached they squat close, and\r\nthen are very difficult to be distinguished from the ground. When\r\nfeeding they walk rather slowly, with their legs wide apart. They dust\r\nthemselves in roads and sandy places, and frequent particular spots,\r\nwhere they may be found day after day: like partridges, they take wing\r\nin a flock. In all these respects, in the muscular gizzard adapted for\r\nvegetable food, in the arched beak and fleshy nostrils, short legs and\r\nform of foot, the Tinochorus has a close affinity with quails. But as\r\nsoon as the bird is seen flying, its whole appearance changes; the long\r\npointed wings, so different from those in the gallinaceous order, the\r\nirregular manner of flight, and plaintive cry uttered at the moment of\r\nrising, recall the idea of a snipe. The sportsmen of the _Beagle_\r\nunanimously called it the short-billed snipe. To this genus, or rather\r\nto the family of the Waders, its skeleton shows that it is really\r\nrelated.\r\n\r\nThe Tinochorus is closely related to some other South American birds.\r\nTwo species of the genus Attagis are in almost every respect ptarmigans\r\nin their habits; one lives in Tierra del Fuego, above the limits of the\r\nforest land; and the other just beneath the snow-line on the Cordillera\r\nof Central Chile. A bird of another closely allied genus, Chionis alba,\r\nis\r\nan inhabitant of the antarctic regions; it feeds on seaweed and shells\r\non the tidal rocks. Although not web-footed, from some unaccountable\r\nhabit it is frequently met with far out at sea. This small family of\r\nbirds is one of those which, from its varied relations to other\r\nfamilies, although at present offering only difficulties to the\r\nsystematic naturalist, ultimately may assist in revealing the grand\r\nscheme, common to the present and past ages, on which organised beings\r\nhave been created.\r\n\r\nThe genus Furnarius contains several species, all small birds, living\r\non the ground, and inhabiting open dry countries. In structure they\r\ncannot be compared to any European form. Ornithologists have generally\r\nincluded them among the creepers, although opposed to that family in\r\nevery habit. The best known species is the common oven-bird of La\r\nPlata, the Casara or housemaker of the Spaniards. The nest, whence it\r\ntakes its name, is placed in the most exposed situations, as on the top\r\nof a post, a bare rock, or on a cactus. It is composed of mud and bits\r\nof straw, and has strong thick walls: in shape it precisely resembles\r\nan oven, or depressed beehive. The opening is large and arched, and\r\ndirectly in front, within the nest, there is a partition, which reaches\r\nnearly to the roof, thus forming a passage or antechamber to the true\r\nnest.\r\n\r\nAnother and smaller species of Furnarius (F. cunicularius), resembles\r\nthe oven-bird in the general reddish tint of its plumage, in a peculiar\r\nshrill reiterated cry, and in an odd manner of running by starts. From\r\nits affinity, the Spaniards call it Casarita (or little housebuilder),\r\nalthough its nidification is quite different. The Casarita builds its\r\nnest at the bottom of a narrow cylindrical hole, which is said to\r\nextend horizontally to nearly six feet under ground. Several of the\r\ncountry people told me, that when boys, they had attempted to dig out\r\nthe nest, but had scarcely ever succeeded in getting to the end of the\r\npassage. The bird chooses any low bank of firm sandy soil by the side\r\nof a road or stream. Here (at Bahia Blanca) the walls round the houses\r\nare built of hardened mud, and I noticed that one, which enclosed a\r\ncourtyard where I lodged, was bored through by round holes in a score\r\nof places. On asking the owner the cause of this, he bitterly\r\ncomplained of the little casarita, several of which I afterwards\r\nobserved at work. It is rather curious to find how incapable these\r\nbirds\r\nmust be of acquiring any notion of thickness, for although they were\r\nconstantly flitting over the low wall, they continued vainly to bore\r\nthrough it, thinking it an excellent bank for their nests. I do not\r\ndoubt that each bird, as often as it came to daylight on the opposite\r\nside, was greatly surprised at the marvellous fact.\r\n\r\nI have already mentioned nearly all the mammalia common in this\r\ncountry. Of armadilloes three species occur, namely, the Dasypus\r\nminutus or _pichy_, the D. villosus or _peludo_, and the _apar._ The\r\nfirst extends ten degrees farther south than any other kind; a fourth\r\nspecies, the _Mulita_, does not come as far south as Bahia Blanca. The\r\nfour species have nearly similar habits; the _peludo_, however, is\r\nnocturnal, while the others wander by day over the open plains, feeding\r\non beetles, larvæ, roots, and even small snakes. The _apar_, commonly\r\ncalled _mataco_, is remarkable by having only three movable bands; the\r\nrest of its tesselated covering being nearly inflexible. It has the\r\npower of rolling itself into a perfect sphere, like one kind of English\r\nwoodlouse. In this state it is safe from the attack of dogs; for the\r\ndog not being able to take the whole in its mouth, tries to bite one\r\nside, and the ball slips away. The smooth hard covering of the _mataco_\r\noffers a better defence than the sharp spines of the hedgehog. The\r\n_pichy_ prefers a very dry soil; and the sand-dunes near the coast,\r\nwhere for many months it can never taste water, is its favourite\r\nresort: it often tries to escape notice, by squatting close to the\r\nground. In the course of a day’s ride, near Bahia Blanca, several were\r\ngenerally met with. The instant one was perceived, it was necessary, in\r\norder to catch it, almost to tumble off one’s horse; for in soft soil\r\nthe animal burrowed so quickly, that its hinder quarters would almost\r\ndisappear before one could alight. It seems almost a pity to kill such\r\nnice little animals, for as a Gaucho said, while sharpening his knife\r\non the back of one, “Son tan mansos” (they are so quiet).\r\n\r\nOf reptiles there are many kinds: one snake (a Trigonocephalus, or\r\nCophias, subsequently called by M. Bibron T. crepitans), from the size\r\nof the poison channel in its fangs, must be very deadly. Cuvier, in\r\nopposition to some other naturalists, makes this a sub-genus of the\r\nrattlesnake, and intermediate between it and the viper. In confirmation\r\nof this opinion, I\r\nobserved a fact, which appears to me very curious and instructive, as\r\nshowing how every character, even though it may be in some degree\r\nindependent of structure, has a tendency to vary by slow degrees. The\r\nextremity of the tail of this snake is terminated by a point, which is\r\nvery slightly enlarged; and as the animal glides along, it constantly\r\nvibrates the last inch; and this part striking against the dry grass\r\nand brushwood, produces a rattling noise, which can be distinctly heard\r\nat the distance of six feet. As often as the animal was irritated or\r\nsurprised, its tail was shaken; and the vibrations were extremely\r\nrapid. Even as long as the body retained its irritability, a tendency\r\nto this habitual movement was evident. This Trigonocephalus has,\r\ntherefore, in some respects the structure of a viper, with the habits\r\nof a rattlesnake: the noise, however, being produced by a simpler\r\ndevice. The expression of this snake’s face was hideous and fierce; the\r\npupil consisted of a vertical slit in a mottled and coppery iris; the\r\njaws were broad at the base, and the nose terminated in a triangular\r\nprojection. I do not think I ever saw anything more ugly, excepting,\r\nperhaps, some of the vampire bats. I imagine this repulsive aspect\r\noriginates from the features being placed in positions, with respect to\r\neach other, somewhat proportional to those of the human face; and thus\r\nwe obtain a scale of hideousness.\r\n\r\nAmongst the Batrachian reptiles, I found only one little toad\r\n(Phryniscus nigricans), which was most singular from its colour. If we\r\nimagine, first, that it had been steeped in the blackest ink, and then,\r\nwhen dry, allowed to crawl over a board, freshly painted with the\r\nbrightest vermilion, so as to colour the soles of its feet and parts of\r\nits stomach, a good idea of its appearance will be gained. If it had\r\nbeen an unnamed species, surely it ought to have been called\r\n_Diabolicus_, for it is a fit toad to preach in the ear of Eve. Instead\r\nof being nocturnal in its habits, as other toads are, and living in\r\ndamp obscure recesses, it crawls during the heat of the day about the\r\ndry sand-hillocks and arid plains, where not a single drop of water can\r\nbe found. It must necessarily depend on the dew for its moisture; and\r\nthis probably is absorbed by the skin, for it is known that these\r\nreptiles possess great powers of cutaneous absorption. At Maldonado, I\r\nfound one in a situation nearly as dry as at Bahia Blanca, and thinking\r\nto give it a great treat,\r\ncarried it to a pool of water; not only was the little animal unable to\r\nswim, but I think without help it would soon have been drowned.\r\n\r\nOf lizards there were many kinds, but only one (Proctotretus\r\nmultimaculatus) remarkable from its habits. It lives on the bare sand\r\nnear the sea-coast, and from its mottled colour, the brownish scales\r\nbeing speckled with white, yellowish red, and dirty blue, can hardly be\r\ndistinguished from the surrounding surface. When frightened, it\r\nattempts to avoid discovery by feigning death, with outstretched legs,\r\ndepressed body, and closed eyes: if further molested, it buries itself\r\nwith great quickness in the loose sand. This lizard, from its flattened\r\nbody and short legs, cannot run quickly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nI will here add a few remarks on the hybernation of animals in this\r\npart of South America. When we first arrived at Bahia Blanca, September\r\n7th, 1832, we thought nature had granted scarcely a living creature to\r\nthis sandy and dry country. By digging, however, in the ground, several\r\ninsects, large spiders, and lizards were found in a half-torpid state.\r\nOn the 15th, a few animals began to appear, and by the 18th (three days\r\nfrom the equinox), everything announced the commencement of spring. The\r\nplains were ornamented by the flowers of a pink wood-sorrel, wild peas,\r\nœnotheræ, and geraniums; and the birds began to lay their eggs.\r\nNumerous Lamellicorn and Heteromerous insects, the latter remarkable\r\nfor their deeply sculptured bodies, were slowly crawling about; while\r\nthe lizard tribe, the constant inhabitants of a sandy soil, darted\r\nabout in every direction. During the first eleven days, whilst nature\r\nwas dormant, the mean temperature taken from observations made every\r\ntwo hours on board the _Beagle_, was 51°; and in the middle of the day\r\nthe thermometer seldom ranged above 55°. On the eleven succeeding days,\r\nin which all living things became so animated, the mean was 58°, and\r\nthe range in the middle of the day between sixty and seventy. Here then\r\nan increase of seven degrees in mean temperature, but a greater one of\r\nextreme heat, was sufficient to awake the functions of life. At Monte\r\nVideo, from which we had just before sailed, in the twenty-three days\r\nincluded between the 26th of July and the 19th of August, the mean\r\ntemperature from 276 observations was 58.4°; the mean hottest day being\r\n65.5°, and\r\nthe coldest 46°. The lowest point to which the thermometer fell was\r\n41.5°, and occasionally in the middle of the day it rose to 69° or 70°.\r\nYet with this high temperature, almost every beetle, several genera of\r\nspiders, snails, and land-shells, toads and lizards, were all lying\r\ntorpid beneath stones. But we have seen that at Bahia Blanca, which is\r\nfour degrees southward, and therefore with a climate only a very little\r\ncolder, this same temperature, with a rather less extreme heat, was\r\nsufficient to awake all orders of animated beings. This shows how\r\nnicely the stimulus required to arouse hybernating animals is governed\r\nby the usual climate of the district, and not by the absolute heat. It\r\nis well known that within the tropics the hybernation, or more properly\r\næstivation, of animals is determined not by the temperature, but by the\r\ntimes of drought. Near Rio de Janeiro, I was at first surprised to\r\nobserve that, a few days after some little depressions had been filled\r\nwith water, they were peopled by numerous full-grown shells and\r\nbeetles, which must have been lying dormant. Humboldt has related the\r\nstrange accident of a hovel having been erected over a spot where a\r\nyoung crocodile lay buried in the hardened\r\nmud. He adds, “The Indians often find enormous boas, which they call\r\nUji, or water serpents, in the same lethargic state. To reanimate them,\r\nthey must be irritated or wetted with water.”\r\n\r\nI will only mention one other animal, a zoophyte (I believe Virgularia\r\nPatagonica), a kind of sea-pen. It consists of a thin, straight, fleshy\r\nstem, with alternate rows of polypi on each side, and surrounding an\r\nelastic stony axis, varying in length from eight inches to two feet.\r\nThe stem at one extremity is truncate, but at the other is terminated\r\nby a vermiform fleshy appendage. The stony axis which gives strength to\r\nthe stem may be traced at this extremity into a mere vessel filled with\r\ngranular matter. At low water hundreds of these zoophytes might be\r\nseen, projecting like stubble, with the truncate end upwards, a few\r\ninches above the surface of the muddy sand. When touched or pulled they\r\nsuddenly drew themselves in with force, so as nearly or quite to\r\ndisappear. By this action, the highly elastic axis must be bent at the\r\nlower extremity, where it is naturally slightly curved; and I imagine\r\nit is by this elasticity alone that the zoophyte is enabled to rise\r\nagain through the mud. Each polypus, though closely united to its\r\nbrethren, has a distinct mouth, body, and tentacula. Of these polypi,\r\nin a large specimen, there must be many thousands; yet we see that they\r\nact by one movement: they have also one central axis connected with a\r\nsystem of obscure circulation, and the ova are produced in an organ\r\ndistinct from the separate individuals.[18] Well may one be allowed to\r\nask, What is an individual? It is always interesting to discover the\r\nfoundation of the strange tales of the old voyagers; and I have no\r\ndoubt but that the habits of\r\nthis Virgularia explain one such case. Captain Lancaster, in his\r\nVoyage[19] in 1601, narrates that on the sea-sands of the Island of\r\nSombrero, in the East Indies, he “found a small twig growing up like a\r\nyoung tree, and on offering to pluck it up it shrinks down to the\r\nground, and sinks, unless held very hard. On being plucked up, a great\r\nworm is found to be its root, and as the tree groweth in greatness, so\r\ndoth the worm diminish, and as soon as the worm is entirely turned into\r\na tree it rooteth in the earth, and so becomes great. This\r\ntransformation is one of the strangest wonders that I saw in all my\r\ntravels: for if this tree is plucked up, while young, and the leaves\r\nand bark stripped off, it becomes a hard stone when dry, much like\r\nwhite coral: thus is this worm twice transformed into different\r\nnatures. Of these we gathered and brought home many.”\r\n\r\n [18] The cavities leading from the fleshy compartments of the\r\n extremity were filled with a yellow pulpy matter, which, examined\r\n under a microscope, presented an extraordinary appearance. The mass\r\n consisted of rounded, semi-transparent, irregular grains, aggregated\r\n together into particles of various sizes. All such particles, and the\r\n separate grains, possessed the power of rapid movement; generally\r\n revolving around different axes, but sometimes progressive. The\r\n movement was visible with a very weak power, but even with the highest\r\n its cause could not be perceived. It was very different from the\r\n circulation of the fluid in the elastic bag, containing the thin\r\n extremity of the axis. On other occasions, when dissecting small\r\n marine animals beneath the microscope, I have seen particles of pulpy\r\n matter, some of large size, as soon as they were disengaged, commence\r\n revolving. I have imagined, I know not with how much truth, that this\r\n granulo-pulpy matter was in process of being converted into ova.\r\n Certainly in this zoophyte such appeared to be the case.\r\n\r\n\r\n [19] Kerr’s _Collection of Voyages_, vol. viii, p. 119.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring my stay at Bahia Blanca, while waiting for the _ Beagle_, the\r\nplace was in a constant state of excitement, from rumours of wars and\r\nvictories, between the troops of Rosas and the wild Indians. One day an\r\naccount came that a small party forming one of the postas on the line\r\nto Buenos Ayres had been found all murdered. The next day three hundred\r\nmen arrived from the Colorado, under the command of Commandant Miranda.\r\nA large portion of these men were Indians (_mansos_, or tame),\r\nbelonging to the tribe of the Cacique Bernantio. They passed the night\r\nhere; and it was impossible to conceive anything more wild and savage\r\nthan the scene of their bivouac. Some drank till they were intoxicated;\r\nothers swallowed the steaming blood of the cattle slaughtered for their\r\nsuppers, and then, being sick from drunkenness, they cast it up again,\r\nand were besmeared with filth and gore.\r\n\r\nNam simul expletus dapibus, vinoque sepultus\r\nCervicem inflexam posuit, jacuitque per antrum\r\nImmensus, saniem eructans, ac frusta cruenta\r\nPer somnum commixta mero.\r\n\r\nIn the morning they started for the scene of the murder, with orders to\r\nfollow the rastro, or track, even if it led them\r\nto Chile. We subsequently heard that the wild Indians had escaped into\r\nthe great Pampas, and from some cause the track had been missed. One\r\nglance at the rastro tells these people a whole history. Supposing they\r\nexamine the track of a thousand horses, they will soon guess the number\r\nof mounted ones by seeing how many have cantered; by the depth of the\r\nother impressions, whether any horses were loaded with cargoes; by the\r\nirregularity of the footsteps, how far tired; by the manner in which\r\nthe food has been cooked, whether the pursued travelled in haste; by\r\nthe general appearance, how long it has been since they passed. They\r\nconsider a rastro of ten days or a fortnight quite recent enough to be\r\nhunted out. We also heard that Miranda struck from the west end of the\r\nSierra Ventana, in a direct line to the island of Cholechel, situated\r\nseventy leagues up the Rio Negro. This is a distance of between two and\r\nthree hundred miles, through a country completely unknown. What other\r\ntroops in the world are so independent? With the sun for their guide,\r\nmare’s flesh for food, their saddle-cloths for beds,—as long as there\r\nis a little water, these men would penetrate to the end of the world.\r\n\r\nA few days afterwards I saw another troop of these banditti-like\r\nsoldiers start on an expedition against a tribe of Indians at the small\r\nSalinas, who had been betrayed by a prisoner cacique. The Spaniard who\r\nbrought the orders for this expedition was a very intelligent man. He\r\ngave me an account of the last engagement at which he was present. Some\r\nIndians, who had been taken prisoners, gave information of a tribe\r\nliving north of the Colorado. Two hundred soldiers were sent; and they\r\nfirst discovered the Indians by a cloud of dust from their horses’ feet\r\nas they chanced to be travelling. The country was mountainous and wild,\r\nand it must have been far in the interior, for the Cordillera were in\r\nsight. The Indians, men, women, and children, were about one hundred\r\nand ten in number, and they were nearly all taken or killed, for the\r\nsoldiers sabre every man. The Indians are now so terrified that they\r\noffer no resistance in a body, but each flies, neglecting even his wife\r\nand children; but when overtaken, like wild animals, they fight against\r\nany number to the last moment. One dying Indian seized with his teeth\r\nthe thumb of his adversary,\r\nand allowed his own eye to be forced out sooner than relinquish his\r\nhold. Another, who was wounded, feigned death, keeping a knife ready to\r\nstrike one more fatal blow. My informer said, when he was pursuing an\r\nIndian, the man cried out for mercy, at the same time that he was\r\ncovertly loosing the bolas from his waist, meaning to whirl it round\r\nhis head and so strike his pursuer. “I however struck him with my sabre\r\nto the ground, and then got off my horse, and cut his throat with my\r\nknife.” This is a dark picture; but how much more shocking is the\r\nunquestionable fact, that all the women who appear above twenty years\r\nold are massacred in cold blood? When I exclaimed that this appeared\r\nrather inhuman, he answered, “Why, what can be done? they breed so!”\r\n\r\nEvery one here is fully convinced that this is the most just war,\r\nbecause it is against barbarians. Who would believe in this age that\r\nsuch atrocities could be committed in a Christian civilised country?\r\nThe children of the Indians are saved, to be sold or given away as\r\nservants, or rather slaves for as long a time as the owners can make\r\nthem believe themselves slaves; but I believe in their treatment there\r\nis little to complain of.\r\n\r\nIn the battle four men ran away together. They were pursued, one was\r\nkilled, and the other three were taken alive. They turned out to be\r\nmessengers or ambassadors from a large body of Indians, united in the\r\ncommon cause of defence, near the Cordillera. The tribe to which they\r\nhad been sent was on the point of holding a grand council, the feast of\r\nmare’s flesh was ready, and the dance prepared: in the morning the\r\nambassadors were to have returned to the Cordillera. They were\r\nremarkably fine men, very fair, above six feet high, and all under\r\nthirty years of age. The three survivors of course possessed very\r\nvaluable information and to extort this they were placed in a line. The\r\ntwo first being questioned, answered, “No sé” (I do not know), and were\r\none after the other shot. The third also said “No sé;” adding, “Fire, I\r\nam a man, and can die!” Not one syllable would they breathe to injure\r\nthe united cause of their country! The conduct of the above-mentioned\r\ncacique was very different; he saved his life by betraying the intended\r\nplan of warfare, and the point of union in the Andes. It was believed\r\nthat there were already six or\r\nseven hundred Indians together, and that in summer their numbers would\r\nbe doubled. Ambassadors were to have been sent to the Indians at the\r\nsmall Salinas, near Bahia Blanca, whom I have mentioned that this same\r\ncacique had betrayed. The communication, therefore, between the\r\nIndians, extends from the Cordillera to the coast of the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nGeneral Rosas’s plan is to kill all stragglers, and having driven the\r\nremainder to a common point, to attack them in a body, in the summer,\r\nwith the assistance of the Chilenos. This operation is to be repeated\r\nfor three successive years. I imagine the summer is chosen as the time\r\nfor the main attack, because the plains are then without water, and the\r\nIndians can only travel in particular directions. The escape of the\r\nIndians to the south of the Rio Negro, where in such a vast unknown\r\ncountry they would be safe, is prevented by a treaty with the\r\nTehuelches to this effect;—that Rosas pays them so much to slaughter\r\nevery Indian who passes to the south of the river, but if they fail in\r\nso doing, they themselves are to be exterminated. The war is waged\r\nchiefly against the Indians near the Cordillera; for many of the tribes\r\non this eastern side are fighting with Rosas. The general, however,\r\nlike Lord Chesterfield, thinking that his friends may in a future day\r\nbecome his enemies, always places them in the front ranks, so that\r\ntheir numbers may be thinned. Since leaving South America we have heard\r\nthat this war of extermination completely failed.\r\n\r\nAmong the captive girls taken in the same engagement, there were two\r\nvery pretty Spanish ones, who had been carried away by the Indians when\r\nyoung, and could now only speak the Indian tongue. From their account\r\nthey must have come from Salta, a distance in a straight line of nearly\r\none thousand miles. This gives one a grand idea of the immense\r\nterritory over which the Indians roam: yet, great as it is, I think\r\nthere will not, in another half-century, be a wild Indian northward of\r\nthe Rio Negro. The warfare is too bloody to last; the Christians\r\nkilling every Indian, and the Indians doing the same by the Christians.\r\nIt is melancholy to trace how the Indians have given way before the\r\nSpanish invaders. Schirdel[20] says that in 1535, when Buenos Ayres was\r\nfounded, there were villages\r\ncontaining two and three thousand inhabitants. Even in Falconer’s time\r\n(1750) the Indians made inroads as far as Luxan, Areco, and Arrecife,\r\nbut now they are driven beyond the Salado. Not only have whole tribes\r\nbeen exterminated, but the remaining Indians have become more\r\nbarbarous: instead of living in large villages, and being employed in\r\nthe arts of fishing, as well as of the chase, they now wander about the\r\nopen plains, without home or fixed occupation.\r\n\r\n [20] Purchas’s _Collection of Voyages._ I believe the date was really\r\n 1537.\r\n\r\nI heard also some account of an engagement which took place, a few\r\nweeks previously to the one mentioned, at Cholechel. This is a very\r\nimportant station on account of being a pass for horses; and it was, in\r\nconsequence, for some time the head-quarters of a division of the army.\r\nWhen the troops first arrived there they found a tribe of Indians, of\r\nwhom they killed twenty or thirty. The cacique escaped in a manner\r\nwhich astonished every one. The chief Indians always have one or two\r\npicked horses, which they keep ready for any urgent occasion. On one of\r\nthese, an old white horse, the cacique sprung, taking with him his\r\nlittle son. The horse had neither saddle nor bridle. To avoid the\r\nshots, the Indian rode in the peculiar method of his nation; namely,\r\nwith an arm round the horse’s neck, and one leg only on its back. Thus\r\nhanging on one side, he was seen patting the horse’s head, and talking\r\nto him. The pursuers urged every effort in the chase; the Commandant\r\nthree times changed his horse, but all in vain. The old Indian father\r\nand his son escaped, and were free. What a fine picture one can form in\r\none’s mind,—the naked, bronze-like figure of the old man with his\r\nlittle boy, riding like a Mazeppa on the white horse, thus leaving far\r\nbehind him the host of his pursuers!\r\n\r\nI saw one day a soldier striking fire with a piece of flint, which I\r\nimmediately recognised as having been a part of the head of an arrow.\r\nHe told me it was found near the island of Cholechel, and that they are\r\nfrequently picked up there. It was between two and three inches long,\r\nand therefore twice as large as those now used in Tierra del Fuego: it\r\nwas made of opaque cream-coloured flint, but the point and barbs had\r\nbeen intentionally broken off. It is well known that no Pampas Indians\r\nnow use bows and arrows. I believe a small tribe in Banda Oriental must\r\nbe excepted; but\r\nthey are widely separated from the Pampas Indians, and border close on\r\nthose tribes that inhabit the forest, and live on foot. It appears,\r\ntherefore, that these arrow-heads are antiquarian[21] relics of the\r\nIndians, before the great change in habits consequent on the\r\nintroduction of the horse into South America.\r\n\r\n [21] Azara has even doubted whether the Pampas Indians ever used bows.\r\n[Several similar agate arrow-heads have since been dug up at Chupat,\r\nand two were given to me, on the occasion of my visit there, by the\r\nGovernor.—R. T. Pritchett, 1880.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VI\r\n\r\n\r\nSet out for Buenos Ayres—Rio Sauce—Sierra Ventana—Third Posta—Driving\r\nHorses—Bolas—Partridges and Foxes—Features of the Country—Long-legged\r\nPlover—Teru-tero—Hail-storm—Natural Enclosures in the Sierra\r\nTapalguen—Flesh of Puma—Meat Diet—Guardia del Monte—Effects of Cattle\r\non the Vegetation—Cardoon—Buenos Ayres—Corral where Cattle are\r\nslaughtered.\r\n\r\nBAHIA BLANCA TO BUENOS AYRES.\r\n\r\n_September_ 8_th._—I hired a Gaucho to accompany me on my ride to\r\nBuenos Ayres, though with some difficulty, as the father of one man was\r\nafraid to let him go, and another who seemed willing, was described to\r\nme as so fearful that I was afraid to take him, for I was told that\r\neven if he saw an ostrich at a distance, he would mistake it for an\r\nIndian, and would fly like the wind away. The distance to Buenos Ayres\r\nis about four hundred miles, and nearly the whole way through an\r\nuninhabited country. We started early in the morning; ascending a few\r\nhundred feet from the basin of green turf on which Bahia Blanca stands,\r\nwe entered on a wide desolate plain. It consists of a\r\ncrumbling argillaceo-calcareous rock, which, from the dry nature of the\r\nclimate, supports only scattered tufts of withered grass, without a\r\nsingle bush or tree to break the monotonous uniformity. The weather was\r\nfine, but the atmosphere remarkably hazy; I thought the appearance\r\nforeboded a gale, but the Gauchos said it was owing to the plain, at\r\nsome great distance in the interior, being on fire. After a long\r\ngallop, having changed horses twice, we reached the Rio Sauce: it is a\r\ndeep, rapid, little stream, not above twenty-five feet wide. The second\r\nposta on the road to Buenos Ayres stands on its banks, a little above\r\nthere is a ford for horses, where the water does not reach to the\r\nhorses’ belly; but from that point, in its course to the sea, it is\r\nquite impassable, and hence makes a most useful barrier against the\r\nIndians.\r\n\r\nInsignificant as this stream is, the Jesuit Falconer, whose information\r\nis generally so very correct, figures it as a considerable river,\r\nrising at the foot of the Cordillera. With respect to its source, I do\r\nnot doubt that this is the case; for the Gauchos assured me, that in\r\nthe middle of the dry summer this stream, at the same time with the\r\nColorado, has periodical floods, which can only originate in the snow\r\nmelting on the Andes. It is extremely improbable that a stream so small\r\nas the Sauce then was should traverse the entire width of the\r\ncontinent; and indeed, if it were the residue of a large river, its\r\nwaters, as in other ascertained cases, would be saline. During the\r\nwinter we must look to the springs round the Sierra Ventana as the\r\nsource of its pure and limpid stream. I suspect the plains of\r\nPatagonia, like those of Australia, are traversed by many watercourses,\r\nwhich only perform their proper parts at certain periods. Probably this\r\nis the case with the water which flows into the head of Port Desire,\r\nand likewise with the Rio Chupat, on the banks of which masses of\r\nhighly cellular scoriæ were found by the officers employed in the\r\nsurvey.\r\n\r\nAs it was early in the afternoon when we arrived, we took fresh horses\r\nand a soldier for a guide, and started for the Sierra de la Ventana.\r\nThis mountain is visible from the anchorage at Bahia Blanca; and\r\nCaptain Fitz Roy calculates its height to be 3340 feet—an altitude very\r\nremarkable on this eastern side of the continent. I am not aware that\r\nany\r\nforeigner, previous to my visit, had ascended this mountain; and indeed\r\nvery few of the soldiers at Bahia Blanca knew anything about it. Hence\r\nwe heard of beds of coal, of gold and silver, of caves, and of forests,\r\nall of which inflamed my curiosity, only to disappoint it. The distance\r\nfrom the posta was about six leagues, over a level plain of the same\r\ncharacter as before. The ride was, however, interesting, as the\r\nmountain began to show its true form. When we reached the foot of the\r\nmain ridge, we had much difficulty in finding any water, and we thought\r\nwe should have been obliged to have passed the night without any. At\r\nlast we discovered some by looking close to the mountain, for at the\r\ndistance even of a few hundred yards, the streamlets were buried and\r\nentirely lost in the friable calcareous stone and loose detritus. I do\r\nnot think Nature ever made a more solitary, desolate pile of rock;—it\r\nwell deserves its name of _Hurtado_, or separated. The mountain is\r\nsteep, extremely rugged, and broken, and so entirely destitute of\r\ntrees, and even bushes, that we actually could not make a skewer to\r\nstretch out our meat over the fire of thistle-stalks.[1] The strange\r\naspect of this mountain is contrasted by the sea-like plain, which not\r\nonly abuts against its steep sides, but likewise separates the parallel\r\nranges. The uniformity of the colouring gives an extreme quietness to\r\nthe view;—the whitish grey of the quartz rock, and the light brown of\r\nthe withered grass of the plain, being unrelieved by any brighter tint.\r\nFrom custom one expects to see in the neighbourhood of a lofty and bold\r\nmountain a broken country strewed over with huge fragments. Here Nature\r\nshows that the last movement before the bed of the sea is changed into\r\ndry land may sometimes be one of tranquillity. Under these\r\ncircumstances I was curious to observe how far from the parent rock any\r\npebbles could be found. On the shores of Bahia Blanca, and near the\r\nsettlement, there were some of quartz, which certainly must have come\r\nfrom this source: the distance is forty-five miles.\r\n\r\n [1] I call these thistle-stalks for the want of a more correct name. I\r\n believe it is a species of Eryngium.\r\n\r\nThe dew, which in the early part of the night wetted the saddle-cloths\r\nunder which we slept, was in the morning frozen. The plain, though\r\nappearing horizontal, had insensibly sloped\r\nup to a height of between 800 and 900 feet above the sea. In the\r\nmorning (9th of September) the guide told me to ascend the nearest\r\nridge, which he thought would lead me to the four peaks that crown the\r\nsummit. The climbing up such rough rocks was very fatiguing; the sides\r\nwere so indented, that what was gained in one five minutes was often\r\nlost in the next. At last, when I reached the ridge, my disappointment\r\nwas extreme in finding a precipitous valley as deep as the plain, which\r\ncut the chain traversely in two, and separated me from the four points.\r\nThis valley is very narrow, but flat-bottomed, and it forms a fine\r\nhorse-pass for the Indians, as it connects the plains on the northern\r\nand southern sides of the range. Having descended, and while crossing\r\nit, I saw two horses grazing: I immediately hid myself in the long\r\ngrass, and began to reconnoitre; but as I could see no signs of Indians\r\nI proceeded cautiously on my second ascent. It was late in the day, and\r\nthis part of the mountain, like the other, was steep and rugged. I was\r\non the top of the second peak by two o’clock, but got there with\r\nextreme difficulty; every twenty yards I had the cramp in the upper\r\npart of both thighs, so that I was afraid I should not have been able\r\nto have got down again. It was also necessary to return by another\r\nroad, as it was out of the question to pass over the saddle-back. I was\r\ntherefore obliged to give up the two higher peaks. Their altitude was\r\nbut little greater, and every purpose of geology had been answered; so\r\nthat the attempt was not worth the hazard of any further exertion. I\r\npresume the cause of the cramp was the great change in the kind of\r\nmuscular action, from that of hard riding to that of still harder\r\nclimbing. It is a lesson worth remembering, as in some cases it might\r\ncause much difficulty.\r\n\r\nI have already said the mountain is composed of white quartz rock, and\r\nwith it a little glossy clay-slate is associated. At the height of a\r\nfew hundred feet above the plain, patches of conglomerate adhered in\r\nseveral places to the solid rock. They resembled in hardness, and in\r\nthe nature of the cement, the masses which may be seen daily forming on\r\nsome coasts. I do not doubt these pebbles were in a similar manner\r\naggregated, at a period when the great calcareous formation was\r\ndepositing beneath the surrounding sea. We may believe\r\nthat the jagged and battered forms of the hard quartz yet show the\r\neffects of the waves of an open ocean.\r\n\r\nI was, on the whole, disappointed with this ascent. Even the view was\r\ninsignificant;—a plain like the sea, but without its beautiful colour\r\nand defined outline. The scene, however, was novel, and a little\r\ndanger, like salt to meat, gave it a relish. That the danger was very\r\nlittle was certain, for my two companions made a good fire—a thing\r\nwhich is never done when it is suspected that Indians are near. I\r\nreached the place of our bivouac by sunset, and drinking much maté, and\r\nsmoking several cigaritos, soon made up my bed for the night. The wind\r\nwas very strong and cold, but I never slept more comfortably.\r\n\r\n\r\n_September_ 10_th._—In the morning, having fairly scudded before the\r\ngale, we arrived by the middle of the day at the Sauce posta. On the\r\nroad we saw great numbers of deer, and near the mountain a guanaco. The\r\nplain, which abuts against the Sierra, is traversed by some curious\r\ngulleys, of which one was about twenty feet wide, and at least thirty\r\ndeep; we were obliged in consequence to make a considerable circuit\r\nbefore we could find a pass. We stayed the night at the posta, the\r\nconversation, as was generally the case, being about the Indians. The\r\nSierra Ventana was formerly a great place of resort; and three or four\r\nyears ago there was much fighting there. My guide had been present when\r\nmany Indians were killed: the women escaped to the top of the ridge,\r\nand fought most desperately with great stones; many thus saving\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n_September_ 11_th._—Proceeded to the third posta in company with the\r\nlieutenant who commanded it. The distance is called fifteen leagues;\r\nbut it is only guess-work, and is generally overstated. The road was\r\nuninteresting, over a dry grassy plain; and on our left hand at a\r\ngreater or less distance there were some low hills; a continuation of\r\nwhich we crossed close to the posta. Before our arrival we met a large\r\nherd of cattle and horses, guarded by fifteen soldiers; but we were\r\ntold many had been lost. It is very difficult to drive animals across\r\nthe plains; for if in the night a puma, or even a fox, approaches,\r\nnothing can prevent the horses dispersing in every direction; and a\r\nstorm will have the same effect. A short time since, an officer left\r\nBuenos Ayres with five hundred horses, and when he arrived at the army\r\nhe had under twenty.\r\n\r\nSoon afterwards we perceived by the cloud of dust, that a party of\r\nhorsemen were coming towards us; when far distant my companions knew\r\nthem to be Indians, by their long hair streaming behind their backs.\r\nThe Indians generally have a fillet round their heads, but never any\r\ncovering; and their black hair blowing across their swarthy faces,\r\nheightens to an uncommon degree the wildness of their appearance. They\r\nturned out to be a party of Bernantio’s friendly tribe, going to a\r\nsalina for salt. The Indians eat much salt, their children sucking it\r\nlike sugar. This habit is very different from that of the Spanish\r\nGauchos, who, leading the same kind of life, eat scarcely any:\r\naccording to Mungo Park,[2] it is people who live on vegetable food who\r\nhave an unconquerable desire for salt. The Indians gave us\r\ngood-humoured nods as they passed at full gallop, driving before them a\r\ntroop of horses, and followed by a train of lanky dogs.\r\n\r\n [2] _Travels in Africa_, p. 233.\r\n\r\n\r\n_September_ 12_th_ and 13_th._—I stayed at this posta two days, waiting\r\nfor a troop of soldiers, which General Rosas had the kindness to send\r\nto inform me would shortly travel to Buenos Ayres; and he advised me to\r\ntake the opportunity of the escort. In the morning we rode to some\r\nneighbouring hills to view the country, and to examine the geology.\r\nAfter dinner the soldiers divided themselves into two parties for a\r\ntrial of skill with the bolas. Two spears were stuck in the ground\r\ntwenty-five yards apart, but they were struck and entangled only once\r\nin four or five times. The balls can be thrown fifty or sixty yards,\r\nbut with little certainty. This, however, does not apply to a man on\r\nhorseback; for when the speed of the horse is added to the force of the\r\narm, it is said that they can be whirled with effect to the distance of\r\neighty yards. As a proof of their force, I may mention, that at the\r\nFalkland Islands, when the Spaniards murdered some of their own\r\ncountrymen and all the Englishmen, a young friendly Spaniard was\r\nrunning away, when a great tall man, by name Luciano,\r\ncame at full gallop after him, shouting to him to stop, and saying that\r\nhe only wanted to speak to him. Just as the Spaniard was on the point\r\nof reaching the boat, Luciano threw the balls: they struck him on the\r\nlegs with such a jerk, as to throw him down and to render him for some\r\ntime insensible. The man, after Luciano had had his talk, was allowed\r\nto escape. He told us that his legs were marked by great weals, where\r\nthe thong had wound round, as if he had been flogged with a whip. In\r\nthe middle of the day two men arrived, who brought a parcel from the\r\nnext posta to be forwarded to the general: so that besides these two,\r\nour party consisted this evening of my guide and self, the lieutenant,\r\nand his four soldiers. The latter were strange beings; the first a fine\r\nyoung negro; the second half Indian and negro; and the two others\r\nnondescripts; namely, an old Chilian miner, the colour of mahogany, and\r\nanother partly a mulatto; but two such mongrels, with such detestable\r\nexpressions, I never saw before. At night, when they were sitting round\r\nthe fire, and playing at cards, I retired to view such a Salvator Rosa\r\nscene. They were seated under a low cliff, so that I could look down\r\nupon them; around the party were lying dogs, arms, remnants of deer and\r\nostriches; and their long spears were stuck in the turf. Farther in the\r\ndark background their horses were tied up, ready for any sudden danger.\r\nIf the stillness of the desolate plain was broken by one of the dogs\r\nbarking, a soldier, leaving the fire, would place his head close to the\r\nground, and thus slowly scan the horizon. Even if the noisy teru-tero\r\nuttered its scream, there would be a pause in the conversation, and\r\nevery head, for a moment, a little inclined.\r\n\r\nWhat a life of misery these men appear to us to lead! They were at\r\nleast ten leagues from the Sauce posta, and since the murder committed\r\nby the Indians, twenty from another. The Indians are supposed to have\r\nmade their attack in the middle of the night; for very early in the\r\nmorning after the murder, they were luckily seen approaching this\r\nposta. The whole party here, however, escaped, together with the troop\r\nof horses; each one taking a line for himself, and driving with him as\r\nmany animals as he was able to manage.\r\n\r\nThe little hovel, built of thistle-stalks, in which they slept,\r\nneither kept out the wind nor rain; indeed in the latter case the only\r\neffect the roof had, was to condense it into larger drops. They had\r\nnothing to eat excepting what they could catch, such as ostriches,\r\ndeer, armadilloes, etc., and their only fuel was the dry stalks of a\r\nsmall plant, somewhat resembling an aloe. The sole luxury which these\r\nmen enjoyed was smoking the little paper cigars, and sucking maté. I\r\nused to think that the carrion vultures, man’s constant attendants on\r\nthese dreary plains, while seated on the little neighbouring cliffs,\r\nseemed by their very patience to say, “Ah! when the Indians come we\r\nshall have a feast.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn the morning we all sallied forth to hunt, and although we had not\r\nmuch success, there were some animated chases. Soon after starting the\r\nparty separated, and so arranged their plans, that at a certain time of\r\nthe day (in guessing which they show much skill) they should all meet\r\nfrom different points of the compass on a plain piece of ground, and\r\nthus drive together the wild animals. One day I went out hunting at\r\nBahia Blanca, but the men there merely rode in a crescent, each being\r\nabout\r\na quarter of a mile apart from the other. A fine male ostrich being\r\nturned by the headmost riders, tried to escape on one side. The Gauchos\r\npursued at a reckless pace, twisting their horses about with the most\r\nadmirable command, and each man whirling the balls round his head. At\r\nlength the foremost threw them, revolving through the air: in an\r\ninstant the ostrich rolled over and over, its legs fairly lashed\r\ntogether by the thong.\r\n\r\nThe plains abound with three kinds of partridge,[3] two of which are as\r\nlarge as hen pheasants. Their destroyer, a small and pretty fox, was\r\nalso singularly numerous; in the course of the day we could not have\r\nseen less than forty or fifty. They were generally near their earths,\r\nbut the dogs killed one. When we returned to the posta, we found two of\r\nthe party returned who had been hunting by themselves. They had killed\r\na puma, and had found an ostrich’s nest with twenty-seven eggs in it.\r\nEach of these is said to equal in weight eleven hens’ eggs; so that we\r\nobtained from this one nest as much food as 297 hens’ eggs would have\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\n [3] Two species of Tinamus and _Eudromia elegans_ of A. d’Orbigny,\r\n which can only be called a partridge with regard to its habits.\r\n\r\n\r\n_September_ 14_th._—As the soldiers belonging to the next posta meant to\r\nreturn, and we should together make a party of five, and all armed, I\r\ndetermined not to wait for the expected troops. My host, the\r\nlieutenant, pressed me much to stop. As he had been very obliging—not\r\nonly providing me with food, but lending me his private horses—I wanted\r\nto make him some remuneration. I asked my guide whether I might do so,\r\nbut he told me certainly not; that the only answer I should receive\r\nprobably would be, “We have meat for the dogs in our country, and\r\ntherefore do not grudge it to a Christian.” It must not be supposed\r\nthat the rank of lieutenant in such an army would at all prevent the\r\nacceptance of payment: it was only the high sense of hospitality, which\r\nevery traveller is bound to acknowledge as nearly universal throughout\r\nthese provinces. After galloping some leagues, we came to a low swampy\r\ncountry, which extends for nearly eighty miles northward, as far as the\r\nSierra Tapalguen. In some parts there were fine damp plains, covered\r\nwith grass, while others had a soft, black, and peaty soil. There\r\nwere also many extensive but shallow lakes, and large beds of reeds.\r\nThe country on the whole resembled the better parts of the\r\nCambridgeshire fens. At night we had some difficulty in finding, amidst\r\nthe swamps, a dry place for our bivouac.\r\n\r\n\r\n_September_ 15_th._—Rose very early in the morning, and shortly after\r\npassed the posta where the Indians had murdered the five soldiers. The\r\nofficer had eighteen chuzo wounds in his body. By the middle of the\r\nday, after a hard gallop, we reached the fifth posta: on account of\r\nsome difficulty in procuring horses we stayed there the night. As this\r\npoint was the most exposed on the whole line, twenty-one soldiers were\r\nstationed here; at sunset they returned from hunting, bringing with\r\nthem seven deer, three ostriches, and many armadilloes and partridges.\r\nWhen riding through the country, it is a common practice to set fire to\r\nthe plain; and hence at night, as on this occasion, the horizon was\r\nilluminated in several places by brilliant conflagrations. This is done\r\npartly for the sake of puzzling any stray Indians, but chiefly for\r\nimproving the pasture. In grassy plains unoccupied by the larger\r\nruminating quadrupeds, it seems necessary to remove the superfluous\r\nvegetation by fire, so as to render the new year’s growth serviceable.\r\n\r\nThe rancho at this place did not boast even of a roof, but merely\r\nconsisted of a ring of thistle-stalks, to break the force of the wind.\r\nIt was situated on the borders of an extensive but shallow lake,\r\nswarming with wild fowl, among which the black-necked swan was\r\nconspicuous.\r\n\r\nThe kind of plover which appears as if mounted on stilts (Himantopus\r\nnigricollis), is here common in flocks of considerable size. It has\r\nbeen wrongfully accused of inelegance; when wading about in shallow\r\nwater, which is its favourite resort, its gait is far from awkward.\r\nThese birds in a flock utter a noise, that singularly resembles the cry\r\nof a pack of small dogs in full chase: waking in the night, I have more\r\nthan once been for a moment startled at the distant sound. The\r\nteru-tero (Vanellus cayanus) is another bird which often disturbs the\r\nstillness of the night. In appearance and habits it resembles in many\r\nrespects our peewits; its wings, however, are armed with sharp spurs,\r\nlike those on the legs of the common cock. As our peewit takes its name\r\nfrom the sound of its voice,\r\nso does the teru-tero. While riding over the grassy plains, one is\r\nconstantly pursued by these birds, which appear to hate mankind, and I\r\nam sure deserve to be hated for their never-ceasing, unvaried, harsh\r\nscreams. To the sportsman they are most annoying, by telling every\r\nother bird and animal of his approach: to the traveller in the country\r\nthey may possibly, as Molina says, do good, by warning him of the\r\nmidnight robber. During the breeding season, they attempt, like our\r\npeewits, by feigning to be wounded, to draw away from their nests dogs\r\nand other enemies. The eggs of this bird are esteemed a great delicacy.\r\n\r\n\r\n_September_ 16_th._—To the seventh posta at the foot of the Sierra\r\nTapalguen. The country was quite level, with a coarse herbage and a\r\nsoft peaty soil. The hovel was here remarkably neat, the posts and\r\nrafters being made of about a dozen dry thistle-stalks bound together\r\nwith thongs of hide; and by the support of these Ionic-like columns,\r\nthe roof and sides were thatched with reeds. We were here told a fact,\r\nwhich I would not have credited, if I had not had partly ocular proof\r\nof it; namely, that, during the previous night, hail as large as small\r\napples, and extremely hard, had fallen with such violence as to kill\r\nthe greater number of the wild animals. One of the men had already\r\nfound thirteen deer (Cervus campestris) lying dead, and I saw their\r\n_fresh_ hides; another of the party, a few minutes after my arrival,\r\nbrought in seven more. Now I well know, that one man without dogs could\r\nhardly have killed seven deer in a week. The men believed they had seen\r\nabout fifteen dead ostriches (part of one of which we had for dinner);\r\nand they said that several were running about evidently blind in one\r\neye. Numbers of smaller birds, as ducks, hawks, and partridges, were\r\nkilled. I saw one of the latter with a black mark on its back, as if it\r\nhad been struck with a paving-stone. A fence of thistle-stalks round\r\nthe hovel was nearly broken down, and my informer, putting his head out\r\nto see what was the matter, received a severe cut, and now wore a\r\nbandage. The storm was said to have been of limited extent: we\r\ncertainly saw from our last night’s bivouac a dense cloud and lightning\r\nin this direction. It is marvellous how such strong animals as deer\r\ncould thus have been killed; but I have no doubt, from the evidence I\r\nhave\r\ngiven, that the story is not in the least exaggerated. I am glad,\r\nhowever, to have its credibility supported by the Jesuit\r\nDobrizhoffer,[4] who, speaking of a country much to the northward,\r\nsays, hail fell of an enormous size and killed vast numbers of cattle:\r\nthe Indians hence called the place _Lalegraicavalca_, meaning “the\r\nlittle white things.” Dr. Malcolmson, also, informs me that he\r\nwitnessed in 1831 in India a hail-storm, which killed numbers of large\r\nbirds and much injured the cattle. These hail-stones were flat, and one\r\nwas ten inches in circumference, and another weighed two ounces. They\r\nploughed up a gravel-walk like musket-balls, and passed through\r\nglass-windows, making round holes, but not cracking them.\r\n\r\n [4] _History of the Abipones_, vol. ii, p. 6.\r\n\r\nHaving finished our dinner of hail-stricken meat, we crossed the Sierra\r\nTapalguen; a low range of hills, a few hundred feet in height, which\r\ncommences at Cape Corrientes. The rock in this part is pure quartz;\r\nfarther eastward I understand it is granitic. The hills are of a\r\nremarkable form; they consist of flat patches of table-land, surrounded\r\nby low perpendicular cliffs, like the outliers of a sedimentary\r\ndeposit. The hill which I ascended was very small, not above a couple\r\nof hundred yards in diameter; but I saw others larger. One which goes\r\nby the name of the “Corral,” is said to be two or three miles in\r\ndiameter, and encompassed by perpendicular cliffs between thirty and\r\nforty feet high, excepting at one spot, where the entrance lies.\r\nFalconer[5] gives a curious account of the Indians driving troops of\r\nwild horses into it, and then by guarding the entrance keeping them\r\nsecure. I have never heard of any other instance of table-land in a\r\nformation of quartz, and which, in the hill I examined, had neither\r\ncleavage nor stratification. I was told that the rock of the “Corral”\r\nwas white, and would strike fire.\r\n\r\n [5] Falconer’s _Patagonia_, p. 70.\r\n\r\nWe did not reach the posta on the Rio Tapalguen till after it was dark.\r\nAt supper, from something which was said, I was suddenly struck with\r\nhorror at thinking that I was eating one of the favourite dishes of the\r\ncountry, namely, a half formed calf, long before its proper time of\r\nbirth. It turned out to be Puma; the meat is very white, and remarkably\r\nlike veal in taste. Dr. Shaw was laughed at for stating that “the flesh\r\nof the lion is\r\nin great esteem, having no small affinity with veal, both in colour,\r\ntaste, and flavour.” Such certainly is the case with the Puma. The\r\nGauchos differ in their opinion whether the Jaguar is good eating, but\r\nare unanimous in saying that cat is excellent.\r\n\r\n\r\n_September_ 17_th._—We followed the course of the Rio Tapalguen,\r\nthrough a very fertile country, to the ninth posta. Tapalguen itself,\r\nor the town of Tapalguen, if it may be so called, consists of a\r\nperfectly level plain, studded over, as far as the eye can reach, with\r\nthe toldos, or oven-shaped huts of the Indians. The families of the\r\nfriendly Indians, who were fighting on the side of Rosas, resided here.\r\nWe met and passed many young Indian women, riding by two or three\r\ntogether on the same horse: they, as well as many of the young men,\r\nwere strikingly handsome,—their fine ruddy complexions being the\r\npicture of health. Besides the toldos, there were three ranchos; one\r\ninhabited by the Commandant, and the two others by Spaniards with small\r\nshops.\r\n\r\nWe were here able to buy some biscuit. I had now been several days\r\nwithout tasting anything besides meat: I did not at all dislike this\r\nnew regimen; but I felt as if it would only have agreed with me with\r\nhard exercise. I have heard that patients in England, when desired to\r\nconfine themselves exclusively to an animal diet, even with the hope of\r\nlife before their eyes, have hardly been able to endure it. Yet the\r\nGaucho in the Pampas, for months together, touches nothing but beef.\r\nBut they eat, I observe, a very large proportion of fat, which is of a\r\nless animalised nature; and they particularly dislike dry meat, such as\r\nthat of the Agouti. Dr. Richardson,[6] also, has remarked, “that when\r\npeople have fed for a long time solely upon lean animal food, the\r\ndesire for fat becomes so insatiable, that they can consume a large\r\nquantity of unmixed and even oily fat without nausea:” this appears to\r\nme a curious physiological fact. It is, perhaps, from their meat\r\nregimen that the Gauchos, like other carnivorous animals, can abstain\r\nlong from food. I was told that at Tandeel some troops voluntarily\r\npursued a party of Indians for three days, without eating or drinking.\r\n\r\n [6] _Fauna Boreali-Americana_, vol. i, p. 35.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe saw in the shops many articles, such as horsecloths, belts, and\r\ngarters, woven by the Indian women. The patterns were very pretty, and\r\nthe colours brilliant; the workmanship of the garters was so good that\r\nan English merchant at Buenos Ayres maintained they must have been\r\nmanufactured in England, till he found the tassels had been fastened by\r\nsplit sinew.\r\n\r\n\r\n_September_ 18_th._—We had a very long ride this day. At the twelfth\r\nposta, which is seven leagues south of the Rio Salado, we came to the\r\nfirst estancia with cattle and white women. Afterwards we had to ride\r\nfor many miles through a country flooded with water above our horses’\r\nknees. By crossing the stirrups, and riding Arab-like with our legs\r\nbent up, we contrived to keep tolerably dry. It was nearly dark when we\r\narrived at the Salado; the stream was deep, and about forty yards wide;\r\nin summer, however, its bed becomes almost dry, and the little\r\nremaining water nearly as salt as that of the sea. We slept at one of\r\nthe great estancias of General Rosas. It was fortified, and of such an\r\nextent, that arriving in the dark I thought it was a town and fortress.\r\nIn the morning we saw immense herds of cattle, the general here having\r\nseventy-four square leagues of land. Formerly nearly three hundred men\r\nwere employed about this estate, and they defied all the attacks of the\r\nIndians.\r\n\r\n\r\n_September_ 19_th._—Passed the Guardia del Monte. This is a nice\r\nscattered little town, with many gardens, full of peach and quince\r\ntrees. The plain here looked like that around Buenos Ayres; the turf\r\nbeing short and bright green, with beds of clover and thistles, and\r\nwith bizcacha holes. I was very much struck with the marked change in\r\nthe aspect of the country after having crossed the Salado. From a\r\ncoarse herbage we passed on to a carpet of fine green verdure. I at\r\nfirst attributed this to some change in the nature of the soil, but the\r\ninhabitants assured me that here, as well as in Banda Oriental, where\r\nthere is as great a difference between the country around Monte Video\r\nand the thinly-inhabited savannahs of Colonia, the whole was to be\r\nattributed to the manuring and grazing of the cattle. Exactly the same\r\nfact has been observed in the prairies[7] of\r\nNorth America, where coarse grass, between five and six feet high, when\r\ngrazed by cattle, changes into common pasture land. I am not botanist\r\nenough to say whether the change here is owing to the introduction of\r\nnew species, to the altered growth of the same, or to a difference in\r\ntheir proportional numbers. Azara has also observed with astonishment\r\nthis change: he is likewise much perplexed by the immediate appearance\r\nof plants not occurring in the neighbourhood, on the borders of any\r\ntrack that leads to a newly-constructed hovel. In another part he\r\nsays,[8] “Ces chevaux (sauvages) ont la manie de préférer les chemins,\r\net le bord des routes pour déposer leurs excrémens, dont on trouve des\r\nmonceaux dans ces endroits.” Does this not partly explain the\r\ncircumstance? We thus have lines of richly manured land serving as\r\nchannels of communication across wide districts.\r\n\r\n [7] See Mr. Atwater’s “Account of the Prairies,” in _Silliman’s North\r\n American Journal_, vol. i, p. 117.\r\n\r\n\r\n [8] Azara’s _Voyage_, vol. i, p. 373.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nNear the Guardia we find the southern limit of two European plants, now\r\nbecome extraordinarily common. The fennel in great profusion covers the\r\nditch-banks in the neighbourhood of Buenos Ayres, Monte Video, and\r\nother towns. But the cardoon (Cynara cardunculus)[9] has a far wider\r\nrange: it occurs in these latitudes on both sides of the Cordillera,\r\nacross the continent. I saw it in unfrequented spots in Chile, Entre\r\nRios, and Banda Oriental. In the latter country alone, very many\r\n(probably several hundred) square miles are covered by one mass of\r\nthese prickly plants, and are impenetrable by man or beast. Over the\r\nundulating plains, where these great beds occur, nothing else can now\r\nlive. Before their introduction, however, the surface must have\r\nsupported, as in other parts, a rank herbage. I doubt whether any case\r\nis on record of an invasion on so grand a scale of one plant over the\r\naborigines. As I have already said, I nowhere saw the cardoon south of\r\nthe Salado; but it is\r\nprobable that in proportion as that country becomes inhabited, the\r\ncardoon will extend its limits. The case is different with the giant\r\nthistle (with variegated leaves) of the Pampas, for I met with it in\r\nthe valley of the Sauce. According to the principles so well laid down\r\nby Mr. Lyell, few countries have undergone more remarkable changes,\r\nsince the year 1535, when the first colonist of La Plata landed with\r\nseventy-two horses. The countless herds of horses, cattle, and sheep,\r\nnot only have altered the whole aspect of the vegetation, but they have\r\nalmost banished the guanaco, deer, and ostrich. Numberless other\r\nchanges must likewise have taken place; the wild pig in some parts\r\nprobably replaces the peccari; packs of wild dogs may be heard howling\r\non the wooded banks of the less-frequented streams; and the common cat,\r\naltered into a large and fierce animal, inhabits rocky hills. As M.\r\nd’Orbigny has remarked, the increase in numbers of the carrion-vulture,\r\nsince the introduction of the domestic animals, must have been\r\ninfinitely great; and we have given reasons for believing that they\r\nhave extended their southern range. No doubt many plants, besides the\r\ncardoon and fennel, are naturalised; thus the islands near the mouth of\r\nthe Parana are thickly clothed with peach and orange trees, springing\r\nfrom seeds carried there by the waters of the river.\r\n\r\n [9] M. A. d’Orbigny (vol. i, p. 474) says that the cardoon and\r\n artichoke are both found wild. Dr. Hooker (_Botanical Magazine_, vol.\r\n lv. p. 2862) has described a variety of the Cynara from this part of\r\n South America under the name of inermis. He states that botanists are\r\n now generally agreed that the cardoon and the artichoke are varieties\r\n of one plant. I may add, that an intelligent farmer assured me that he\r\n had observed in a deserted garden some artichokes changing into the\r\n common cardoon. Dr. Hooker believes that Head’s vivid description of\r\n the thistle of the Pampas applies to the cardoon, but this is a\r\n mistake. Captain Head referred to the plant which I have mentioned a\r\n few lines lower down under the title of giant thistle. Whether it is a\r\n true thistle, I do not know; but it is quite different from the\r\n cardoon; and more like a thistle properly so called.\r\n\r\nWhile changing horses at the Guardia several people questioned us much\r\nabout the army,—I never saw anything like the enthusiasm for Rosas, and\r\nfor the success of the “most just of all wars, because against\r\nbarbarians.” This expression, it must be confessed, is very natural,\r\nfor till lately, neither man, woman, nor horse was safe from the\r\nattacks of the Indians. We had a long day’s ride over the same rich\r\ngreen plain, abounding with various flocks, and with here and there a\r\nsolitary estancia, and its one _ombu_ tree. In the evening it rained\r\nheavily: on arriving at a post-house we were told by the owner that if\r\nwe had not a regular passport we must pass on, for there were so many\r\nrobbers he would trust no one. When he read, however, my passport,\r\nwhich began with “El Naturalista Don Carlos,” his respect and civility\r\nwere as unbounded as his suspicions had been before. What a naturalist\r\nmight be, neither he nor his countrymen, I suspect, had any idea; but\r\nprobably my title lost nothing of its value from that cause.\r\n\r\n\r\n_September_ 20_th._—We arrived by the middle of the day at Buenos\r\nAyres. The outskirts of the city looked quite pretty, with the agave\r\nhedges, and groves of olive, peach and willow trees, all just throwing\r\nout their fresh green leaves. I rode to the house of Mr. Lumb, an\r\nEnglish merchant, to whose kindness and hospitality, during my stay in\r\nthe country, I was greatly indebted.\r\n\r\nThe city of Buenos Ayres is large;[10] and I should think one of the\r\nmost regular in the world. Every street is at right angles to the one\r\nit crosses, and the parallel ones being equidistant, the houses are\r\ncollected into solid squares of equal dimensions, which are called\r\nquadras. On the other hand, the houses themselves are hollow squares;\r\nall the rooms opening into a neat little courtyard. They are generally\r\nonly one story high, with flat roofs, which are fitted with seats, and\r\nare much frequented by the inhabitants in summer. In the centre of the\r\ntown is the Plaza, where the public offices, fortress, cathedral, etc.,\r\nstand. Here also, the old viceroys, before the revolution, had their\r\npalaces. The general assemblage of buildings possesses considerable\r\narchitectural beauty, although none individually can boast of any.\r\n\r\n [10] It is said to contain 60,000 inhabitants. Monte Video, the second\r\n town of importance on the banks of the Plata, has 15,000.\r\n\r\nThe great _corral_, where the animals are kept for slaughter to supply\r\nfood to this beef-eating population, is one of the spectacles best\r\nworth seeing. The strength of the horse as compared to that of the\r\nbullock is quite astonishing: a man on horseback having thrown his lazo\r\nround the horns of a beast, can drag it anywhere he chooses. The animal\r\nploughing up the ground with outstretched legs, in vain efforts to\r\nresist the force, generally dashes at full speed to one side; but the\r\nhorse, immediately turning to receive the shock, stands so firmly that\r\nthe bullock is almost thrown down, and it is surprising that their\r\nnecks are not broken. The struggle is not, however, one of fair\r\nstrength; the horse’s girth being matched against the bullock’s\r\nextended neck. In a similar manner a man can hold the wildest horse, if\r\ncaught with the lazo, just behind the ears. When the bullock has been\r\ndragged to the spot where it is to be slaughtered, the _matador_ with\r\ngreat caution cuts the hamstrings. Then is given the death\r\nbellow; a noise more expressive of fierce agony than any I know. I have\r\noften distinguished it from a long distance, and have always known that\r\nthe struggle was then drawing to a close. The whole sight is horrible\r\nand revolting: the ground is almost made of bones; and the horses and\r\nriders are drenched with gore.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VII\r\n\r\n\r\nExcursion to St. Fé—Thistle Beds—Habits of the Bizcacha—Little\r\nOwl—Saline Streams—Level Plains—Mastodon—St. Fé—Change in\r\nLandscape—Geology—Tooth of extinct Horse—Relation of the Fossil and\r\nrecent Quadrupeds of North and South America—Effects of a great\r\nDrought—Parana—Habits of the Jaguar—Scissor-beak—Kingfisher, Parrot,\r\nand Scissor-tail—Revolution—Buenos Ayres—State of Government.\r\n\r\nBUENOS AYRES TO ST. FÉ.\r\n\r\n_September_ 27_th._—In the evening I set out on an excursion to St. Fé,\r\nwhich is situated nearly three hundred English miles from Buenos Ayres,\r\non the banks of the Parana. The roads in the neighbourhood of the city,\r\nafter the rainy weather, were extraordinarily bad. I should never have\r\nthought it possible for a bullock waggon to have crawled along: as it\r\nwas, they scarcely went at the rate of a mile an hour, and a man was\r\nkept ahead, to survey the best line for making the attempt. The\r\nbullocks were terribly jaded: it is a great mistake to suppose that\r\nwith improved roads, and an accelerated rate of travelling, the\r\nsufferings of the animals increase in the same\r\nproportion. We passed a train of waggons and a troop of beasts on their\r\nroad to Mendoza. The distance is about 580 geographical miles, and the\r\njourney is generally performed in fifty days. These waggons are very\r\nlong, narrow, and thatched with reeds; they have only two wheels, the\r\ndiameter of which in some cases is as much as ten feet. Each is drawn\r\nby six bullocks, which are urged on by a goad at least twenty feet\r\nlong: this is suspended from within the roof; for the wheel bullocks a\r\nsmaller one is kept; and for the intermediate pair, a point projects at\r\nright angles from the middle of the long one. The whole apparatus\r\nlooked like some implement of war.\r\n\r\n_September_ 28_th._—We passed the small town of Luxan, where there is a\r\nwooden bridge over the river—a most unusual convenience in this\r\ncountry. We passed also Areco. The plains appeared level, but were not\r\nso in fact; for in various places the horizon was distant. The\r\nestancias are here wide apart; for there is little good pasture, owing\r\nto the land being covered by beds either of an acrid clover, or of the\r\ngreat thistle. The latter, well known from the animated description\r\ngiven by Sir F. Head, were at this time of the year two-thirds grown;\r\nin some parts they were as high as the horse’s back, but in others they\r\nhad not yet sprung up, and the ground was bare and dusty as on a\r\nturnpike-road. The clumps were of the most brilliant green, and they\r\nmade a pleasing miniature-likeness of broken forest land. When the\r\nthistles are full grown, the great beds are impenetrable, except by a\r\nfew tracks, as intricate as those in a labyrinth. These are only known\r\nto the robbers, who at this season inhabit them, and sally forth at\r\nnight to rob and cut throats with impunity. Upon asking at a house\r\nwhether robbers were numerous, I was answered, “The thistles are not up\r\nyet;”—the meaning of which reply was not at first very obvious. There\r\nis little interest in passing over these tracts, for they are inhabited\r\nby few animals or birds, excepting the bizcacha and its friend the\r\nlittle owl.\r\n\r\nThe bizcacha[1] is well known to form a prominent feature in the\r\nzoology of the Pampas. It is found as far south as the\r\nRio Negro, in lat. 41°, but not beyond. It cannot, like the agouti,\r\nsubsist on the gravelly and desert plains of Patagonia, but prefers a\r\nclayey or sandy soil, which produces a different and more abundant\r\nvegetation. Near Mendoza, at the foot of the Cordillera, it occurs in\r\nclose neighbourhood with the allied alpine species. It is a very\r\ncurious circumstance in its geographical distribution, that it has\r\nnever been seen, fortunately for the inhabitants of Banda Oriental, to\r\nthe eastward of the river Uruguay: yet in this province there are\r\nplains which appear admirably adapted to its habits. The Uruguay has\r\nformed an insuperable obstacle to its migration: although the broader\r\nbarrier of the Parana has been passed, and the bizcacha is common in\r\nEntre Rios, the province between these two great rivers. Near Buenos\r\nAyres these animals are exceedingly common. Their most favourite resort\r\nappears to be those parts of the plain which during one half of the\r\nyear are covered with giant thistles, to the exclusion of other plants.\r\nThe Gauchos affirm that it lives on roots; which, from the great\r\nstrength of its gnawing teeth, and the kind of places frequented by it,\r\nseems probable. In the evening the bizcachas come out in numbers, and\r\nquietly sit at the mouths of their burrows on their haunches. At such\r\ntimes they are very tame, and a man on horseback passing by seems only\r\nto present an object for their grave contemplation. They run very\r\nawkwardly, and when running out of danger, from their elevated tails\r\nand short front legs, much resemble great rats. Their flesh, when\r\ncooked, is very white and good, but it is seldom used.\r\n\r\n [1] The bizcacha (Lagostomus trichodactylus) somewhat resembles a\r\n large rabbit, but with bigger gnawing teeth and a long tail; it has,\r\n however, only three toes behind, like the agouti. During the last\r\n three or four years the skins of these animals have been sent to\r\n England for the sake of the fur.\r\n\r\nThe bizcacha has one very singular habit; namely, dragging every hard\r\nobject to the mouth of its burrow: around each group of holes many\r\nbones of cattle, stones, thistle-stalks, hard lumps of earth, dry dung,\r\netc., are collected into an irregular heap, which frequently amounts to\r\nas much as a wheelbarrow would contain. I was credibly informed that a\r\ngentleman, when riding on a dark night, dropped his watch; he returned\r\nin the morning, and by searching the neighbourhood of every bizcacha\r\nhole on the line of road, as he expected, he soon found it. This habit\r\nof picking up whatever may be lying on the ground anywhere near its\r\nhabitation must cost much trouble. For what purpose it is done, I am\r\nquite unable to form even the most remote conjecture: it cannot be for\r\ndefence, because the rubbish is chiefly placed above the mouth of the\r\nburrow, which enters the ground at a very small inclination. No doubt\r\nthere must exist some good reason; but the inhabitants of the country\r\nare quite ignorant of it. The only fact which I know analogous to it,\r\nis the habit of that extraordinary Australian bird, the Calodera\r\nmaculata, which makes an elegant vaulted passage of twigs for playing\r\nin, and which collects near the spot land and sea-shells, bones, and\r\nthe feathers of birds, especially brightly coloured ones. Mr. Gould,\r\nwho has described these facts, informs me, that the natives, when they\r\nlose any hard object, search the playing passages, and he has known a\r\ntobacco-pipe thus recovered.\r\n\r\nThe little owl (Athene cunicularia), which has been so often mentioned,\r\non the plains of Buenos Ayres exclusively inhabits the holes of the\r\nbizcacha; but in Banda Oriental it is its own workman. During the open\r\nday, but more especially in the evening, these birds may be seen in\r\nevery direction standing frequently by pairs on the hillock near their\r\nburrows. If disturbed they either enter the hole, or, uttering a shrill\r\nharsh cry, move with a remarkably undulatory flight to a short\r\ndistance, and then turning round, steadily gaze at their pursuer.\r\nOccasionally in the evening they may be heard hooting. I found in the\r\nstomachs of two which I opened the remains of mice, and I one day saw a\r\nsmall snake killed and carried away. It is said that snakes are their\r\ncommon prey during the daytime. I may here mention, as showing on what\r\nvarious kinds of food owls subsist, that a species killed among the\r\nislets of the Chonos Archipelago had its stomach full of good-sized\r\ncrabs. In India[2] there is a fishing genus of owls, which likewise\r\ncatches crabs.\r\n\r\n [2] _Journal of Asiatic Soc._, vol. v, p. 363.\r\n\r\nIn the evening we crossed the Rio Arrecife on a simple raft made of\r\nbarrels lashed together, and slept at the post-house on the other side.\r\nI this day paid horse-hire for thirty-one leagues; and although the sun\r\nwas glaring hot I was but little fatigued. When Captain Head talks of\r\nriding fifty leagues a day, I do not imagine the distance is equal to\r\n150 English miles. At all events, the thirty-one leagues was only 76\r\nmiles in a straight line, and in an open country I should think four\r\nadditional miles for turnings would be a sufficient allowance.\r\n\r\n\r\n29_th and_ 30_th._—We continued to ride over plains of the same\r\ncharacter. At San Nicolas I first saw the noble river of the Parana. At\r\nthe foot of the cliff on which the town stands, some large vessels were\r\nat anchor. Before arriving at Rozario, we crossed the Saladillo, a\r\nstream of fine clear running water, but too saline to drink. Rozario is\r\na large town built on a dead level plain, which forms a cliff about\r\nsixty feet high over the Parana. The river here is very broad, with\r\nmany islands, which are low and wooded, as is also the opposite shore.\r\nThe view would resemble that of a great lake, if it were not for the\r\nlinear-shaped islets, which alone give the idea of running water. The\r\ncliffs are the most picturesque part; sometimes they are absolutely\r\nperpendicular, and of a red colour; at other times in large broken\r\nmasses, covered with cacti and mimosa-trees. The real grandeur,\r\nhowever, of an immense river like this is derived from reflecting how\r\nimportant a means of communication and commerce it forms between one\r\nnation and another; to what a distance it travels, and from how vast a\r\nterritory it drains the great body of fresh water which flows past your\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFor many leagues north and south of San Nicolas and Rozario, the\r\ncountry is really level. Scarcely anything which travellers have\r\nwritten about its extreme flatness can be\r\nconsidered as exaggeration. Yet I could never find a spot where, by\r\nslowly turning round, objects were not seen at greater distances in\r\nsome directions than in others; and this manifestly proves inequality\r\nin the plain. At sea, a person’s eye being six feet above the surface\r\nof the water, his horizon is two miles and four-fifths distant. In like\r\nmanner, the more level the plain, the more nearly does the horizon\r\napproach within these narrow limits; and this, in my opinion, entirely\r\ndestroys that grandeur which one would have imagined that a vast level\r\nplain would have possessed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n_October_ 1_st._—We started by moonlight and arrived at the Rio Tercero\r\nby sunrise. This river is also called the Saladillo, and it deserves\r\nthe name, for the water is brackish. I stayed here the greater part of\r\nthe day, searching for fossil bones. Besides a perfect tooth of the\r\nToxodon, and many scattered bones, I found two immense skeletons near\r\neach other, projecting in bold relief from the perpendicular cliff of\r\nthe Parana. They were, however, so completely decayed, that I could\r\nonly bring away small fragments of one of the great molar teeth; but\r\nthese are sufficient to show that the remains belonged to a Mastodon,\r\nprobably to the same species with that which formerly must have\r\ninhabited the Cordillera in Upper Peru in such great numbers. The men\r\nwho took me in the canoe said\r\nthey had long known of these skeletons, and had often wondered how they\r\nhad got there: the necessity of a theory being felt, they came to the\r\nconclusion that, like the bizcacha, the mastodon was formerly a\r\nburrowing animal! In the evening we rode another stage, and crossed the\r\nMonge, another brackish stream, bearing the dregs of the washings of\r\nthe Pampas.\r\n\r\n_October_ 2_nd._—We passed through Corunda, which, from the luxuriance\r\nof its gardens, was one of the prettiest villages I saw. From this\r\npoint to St. Fé the road is not very safe. The western side of the\r\nParana northward ceases to be inhabited; and hence the Indians\r\nsometimes come down thus far, and waylay travellers. The nature of the\r\ncountry also favours this, for instead of a grassy plain, there is an\r\nopen woodland, composed of low prickly mimosas. We passed some houses\r\nthat had been ransacked and since deserted; we saw also a spectacle,\r\nwhich my guides viewed with high satisfaction; it was the skeleton of\r\nan Indian with the dried skin hanging on the bones, suspended to the\r\nbranch of a tree.\r\n\r\nIn the morning we arrived at St. Fé. I was surprised to observe how\r\ngreat a change of climate a difference of only three degrees of\r\nlatitude between this place and Buenos Ayres had caused. This was\r\nevident from the dress and complexion of the men—from the increased\r\nsize of the ombu-trees—the number of new cacti and other plants—and\r\nespecially from the birds. In the course of an hour I remarked\r\nhalf-a-dozen birds, which I had never seen at Buenos Ayres. Considering\r\nthat there is no natural boundary between the two places, and that the\r\ncharacter of the country is nearly similar, the difference was much\r\ngreater than I should have expected.\r\n\r\n_October_ 3_rd and_ 4_th._—I was confined for these two days to my bed\r\nby a headache. A good-natured old woman, who attended me, wished me to\r\ntry many odd remedies. A common practice is, to bind an orange-leaf or\r\na bit of black plaster to each temple: and a still more general plan\r\nis, to split a bean into halves, moisten them, and place one on each\r\ntemple, where they will easily adhere. It is not thought proper ever to\r\nremove the beans or plaster, but to allow them to drop off, and\r\nsometimes, if a man, with patches on his head, is asked, what is the\r\nmatter? he will answer, “I had a headache the day before yesterday.”\r\nMany of the remedies used by the people\r\nof the country are ludicrously strange, but too disgusting to be\r\nmentioned. One of the least nasty is to kill and cut open two puppies\r\nand bind them on each side of a broken limb. Little hairless dogs are\r\nin great request to sleep at the feet of invalids.\r\n\r\nSt. Fé is a quiet little town, and is kept clean and in good order. The\r\ngovernor, Lopez, was a common soldier at the time of the revolution;\r\nbut has now been seventeen years in power. This stability of government\r\nis owing to his tyrannical habits; for tyranny seems as yet better\r\nadapted to these countries than republicanism. The governor’s favourite\r\noccupation is hunting Indians: a short time since he slaughtered\r\nforty-eight, and sold the children at the rate of three or four pounds\r\napiece.\r\n\r\n_October_ 5_th._—We crossed the Parana to St. Fé Bajada, a town on the\r\nopposite shore. The passage took some hours, as the river here\r\nconsisted of a labyrinth of small streams, separated by low wooded\r\nislands. I had a letter of introduction to an old Catalonian Spaniard,\r\nwho treated me with the most uncommon hospitality. The Bajada is the\r\ncapital of Entre Rios. In 1825 the town contained 6000 inhabitants, and\r\nthe province 30,000; yet, few as the inhabitants are, no province has\r\nsuffered more from bloody and desperate revolutions. They boast here of\r\nrepresentatives, ministers, a standing army, and governors: so it is no\r\nwonder that they have their revolutions. At some future day this must\r\nbe one of the richest countries of La Plata. The soil is varied and\r\nproductive; and its almost insular form gives it two grand lines of\r\ncommunication by the rivers Parana and Uruguay.\r\n\r\n\r\nI was delayed here five days, and employed myself in examining the\r\ngeology of the surrounding country, which was very interesting. We here\r\nsee at the bottom of the cliffs, beds containing sharks’ teeth and\r\nsea-shells of extinct species, passing above into an indurated marl,\r\nand from that into the red clayey earth of the Pampas, with its\r\ncalcareous concretions and the bones of terrestrial quadrupeds. This\r\nvertical section clearly tells us of a large bay of pure salt-water,\r\ngradually encroached on, and at last converted into the bed of a muddy\r\nestuary, into which floating carcasses were swept. At Punta Gorda, in\r\nBanda Oriental, I found an alternation of the Pampæan estuary deposit,\r\nwith a limestone containing some of the same extinct sea-shells; and\r\nthis shows either a change in the former currents, or more probably an\r\noscillation of level in the bottom of the ancient estuary. Until\r\nlately, my reasons for considering the Pampæan formation to be an\r\nestuary deposit were, its general appearance, its position at the mouth\r\nof the existing great river the Plata, and the presence of so many\r\nbones of terrestrial quadrupeds: but now Professor Ehrenberg has had\r\nthe kindness to examine for me a little of the red earth, taken from\r\nlow down in the deposit, close to the skeletons of the mastodon, and he\r\nfinds in it many infusoria, partly salt-water and partly fresh-water\r\nforms, with the latter rather preponderating; and therefore, as he\r\nremarks, the water must have been brackish. M. A. d’Orbigny found on\r\nthe banks of the Parana, at the height of a hundred feet, great beds of\r\nan estuary shell, now living a hundred miles lower down nearer the sea;\r\nand I found similar shells at a less height on the banks of the\r\nUruguay; this shows that just before the Pampas was slowly elevated\r\ninto dry land, the water covering it was brackish. Below Buenos Ayres\r\nthere are upraised beds of sea-shells of existing species, which also\r\nproves that the period of elevation of the Pampas was within the recent\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nIn the Pampæan deposit at the Bajada I found the osseous armour of a\r\ngigantic armadillo-like animal, the inside of which, when the earth was\r\nremoved, was like a great cauldron; I found also teeth of the Toxodon\r\nand Mastodon, and one tooth of a Horse, in the same stained and decayed\r\nstate. This latter tooth greatly interested me,[3] and I took\r\nscrupulous care in ascertaining that it had been embedded\r\ncontemporaneously with the other remains; for I was not then aware that\r\namongst the fossils from Bahia Blanca there was a horse’s tooth hidden\r\nin the matrix: nor was it then known with certainty that the remains of\r\nhorses are common in North America. Mr. Lyell has lately brought from\r\nthe United States a tooth of a horse; and it is an interesting fact,\r\nthat Professor Owen could find in no species, either fossil or recent,\r\na slight but peculiar curvature characterising it, until he thought of\r\ncomparing it with my\r\nspecimen found here: he has named this American horse Equus curvidens.\r\nCertainly it is a marvellous fact in the history of the Mammalia, that\r\nin South America a native horse should have lived and disappeared, to\r\nbe succeeded in after ages by the countless herds descended from the\r\nfew introduced with the Spanish colonists!\r\n\r\n [3] I need hardly state here that there is good evidence against any\r\n horse living in America at the time of Columbus.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe existence in South America of a fossil horse, of the mastodon,\r\npossibly of an elephant,[4] and of a hollow-horned ruminant, discovered\r\nby MM. Lund and Clausen in the caves of Brazil, are highly interesting\r\nfacts with respect to the geographical distribution of animals. At the\r\npresent time, if we divide America, not by the Isthmus of Panama, but\r\nby the southern part of Mexico[5] in lat. 20°, where the great\r\ntable-land presents an obstacle to the migration of species, by\r\naffecting the climate, and by forming, with the exception of some\r\nvalleys and of a fringe of low land on the coast, a broad barrier; we\r\nshall then have the two zoological provinces of North and South\r\nAmerica strongly contrasted with each other. Some few species alone\r\nhave passed the barrier, and may be considered as wanderers from the\r\nsouth, such as the puma, opossum, kinkajou, and peccari. South America\r\nis characterised by possessing many peculiar gnawers, a family of\r\nmonkeys, the llama, peccari, tapir, opossums, and, especially, several\r\ngenera of Edentata, the order which includes the sloths, ant-eaters,\r\nand armadilloes. North America, on the other hand, is characterised\r\n(putting on one side a few wandering species) by numerous peculiar\r\ngnawers, and by four genera (the ox, sheep, goat, and antelope) of\r\nhollow-horned ruminants, of which great division South America is not\r\nknown to possess a single species. Formerly, but within the period when\r\nmost of the now existing shells were living, North America possessed,\r\nbesides hollow-horned ruminants, the elephant, mastodon, horse, and\r\nthree genera of Edentata, namely, the Megatherium, Megalonyx, and\r\nMylodon. Within nearly this same period (as proved by the shells at\r\nBahia Blanca) South America possessed, as we have just seen, a\r\nmastodon, horse, hollow-horned ruminant, and the same three genera (as\r\nwell as several others) of the Edentata. Hence it is evident that North\r\nand South America, in having within a late geological period these\r\nseveral genera in common, were much more closely related in the\r\ncharacter of their terrestrial inhabitants than they now are. The more\r\nI reflect on this case, the more interesting it appears: I know of no\r\nother instance where we can almost mark the period and manner of the\r\nsplitting up of one great region into two well-characterised zoological\r\nprovinces. The geologist, who is fully impressed with the vast\r\noscillations of level which have affected the earth’s crust within late\r\nperiods, will not fear to speculate on the recent elevation of the\r\nMexican platform, or, more probably, on the recent submergence of land\r\nin the West Indian Archipelago, as the cause of the present zoological\r\nseparation of North and South America. The South American character of\r\nthe West Indian mammals[6] seems to indicate that this archipelago was\r\nformerly united to the southern continent, and that it has subsequently\r\nbeen an area of subsidence.\r\n\r\n [4] Cuvier, _Ossemens Fossils_, tome i, p. 158.\r\n\r\n\r\n [5] This is the geographical division followed by Lichtenstein,\r\n Swainson, Erichson, and Richardson. The section from Vera Cruz to\r\n Acapulco, given by Humboldt in the _Polit. Essay on Kingdom of N.\r\n Spain_ will show how immense a barrier the Mexican table-land forms.\r\n Dr. Richardson, in his admirable _Report on the Zoology of N. America_\r\n read before the British Assoc. 1836 (p. 157), talking of the\r\n identification of a Mexican animal with the _ Synetheres prehensilis_,\r\n says, “We do not know with what propriety, but if correct, it is, if\r\n not a solitary instance, at least very nearly so, of a rodent animal\r\n being common to North and South America.”\r\n\r\n\r\n [6] See Dr. Richardson’s _Report_, p. 157; also _L’Institut_, 1837, p.\r\n 253. Cuvier says the kinkajou is found in the larger Antilles, but\r\n this is doubtful. M. Gervais states that the Didelphis crancrivora is\r\n found there. It is certain that the West Indies possess some mammifers\r\n peculiar to themselves. A tooth of a mastodon has been brought from\r\n Bahama; _Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal_, 1826, p. 395.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen America, and especially North America, possessed its elephants,\r\nmastodons, horse, and hollow-horned ruminants, it was much more closely\r\nrelated in its zoological characters to the temperate parts of Europe\r\nand Asia than it now is. As the remains of these genera are found on\r\nboth sides of Behring’s Straits[7] and on the plains of Siberia, we are\r\nled to look to the north-western side of North America as the former\r\npoint of communication between the Old and so-called New World. And as\r\nso many species, both living and extinct, of these same\r\ngenera inhabit and have inhabited the Old World, it seems most probable\r\nthat the North American elephants, mastodons, horse, and hollow-horned\r\nruminants migrated, on land since submerged near Behring’s Straits,\r\nfrom Siberia into North America, and thence, on land since submerged in\r\nthe West Indies, into South America, where for a time they mingled with\r\nthe forms characteristic of that southern continent, and have since\r\nbecome extinct.\r\n\r\n [7] See the admirable Appendix by Dr. Buckland to Beechey’s _Voyage_;\r\n also the writings of Chamisso in Kotzebue’s _Voyage._\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile travelling through the country, I received several vivid\r\ndescriptions of the effects of a late great drought; and the account of\r\nthis may throw some light on the cases where vast numbers of animals of\r\nall kinds have been embedded together. The period included between the\r\nyears 1827 and 1830 is called the “gran seco,” or the great drought.\r\nDuring this time so little rain fell, that the vegetation, even to the\r\nthistles, failed; the brooks were dried up, and the whole country\r\nassumed the appearance of a dusty high-road. This was especially the\r\ncase in the northern part of the province of Buenos Ayres and the\r\nsouthern part of St. Fé. Very great numbers of birds, wild animals,\r\ncattle, and horses perished from the want of food and water. A man told\r\nme that the deer[8] used to come into his courtyard to the well, which\r\nhe had been obliged to dig to supply his own family with water; and\r\nthat the partridges had hardly strength to fly away when pursued. The\r\nlowest estimation of the loss of cattle in the province of Buenos Ayres\r\nalone, was taken at one million head. A proprietor at San Pedro had\r\npreviously to these years 20,000 cattle; at the end not one remained.\r\nSan Pedro is situated in the middle of the finest country; and even now\r\nabounds again with animals; yet during the latter part of the “gran\r\nseco,” live cattle were brought in vessels for the consumption\r\nof the inhabitants. The animals roamed from their estancias, and,\r\nwandering far southward, were mingled together in such multitudes, that\r\na government commission was sent from Buenos Ayres to settle the\r\ndisputes of the owners. Sir Woodbine Parish informed me of another and\r\nvery curious source of dispute; the ground being so long dry, such\r\nquantities of dust were blown about, that in this open country the\r\nlandmarks became obliterated, and people could not tell the limits of\r\ntheir estates. I was informed by an eye-witness that the cattle in\r\nherds of thousands rushed into the Parana, and being exhausted by\r\nhunger they were unable to crawl up the muddy banks, and thus were\r\ndrowned. The arm of the river which runs by San Pedro was so full of\r\nputrid carcasses, that the master of a vessel told me that the smell\r\nrendered it quite impassable. Without doubt several hundred thousand\r\nanimals thus perished in the river: their bodies when putrid were seen\r\nfloating down the stream; and many in all probability were deposited in\r\nthe estuary of the Plata. All the small rivers became highly saline,\r\nand this caused the death of vast numbers in particular spots; for when\r\nan animal drinks of such water it does not recover. Azara describes[9]\r\nthe fury of the wild horses on a similar occasion, rushing into the\r\nmarshes, those which arrived first being overwhelmed and crushed by\r\nthose which followed. He adds that more than once he has seen the\r\ncarcasses of upwards of a thousand wild horses thus destroyed. I\r\nnoticed that the smaller streams in the Pampas were paved with a\r\nbreccia of bones, but this probably is the effect of a gradual\r\nincrease, rather than of the destruction at any one period.\r\nSubsequently to the drought of 1827 to 1832, a very rainy season\r\nfollowed which caused great floods. Hence it is almost certain that\r\nsome thousands of the skeletons were buried by the deposits of the very\r\nnext year. What would be the opinion of a geologist, viewing such an\r\nenormous collection of bones, of all kinds of animals and of all ages,\r\nthus embedded in one thick earthy mass? Would he not attribute it to a\r\nflood having swept over the surface of the land, rather than to the\r\ncommon order of things?[10]\r\n\r\n [8] In Captain Owen’s _Surveying Voyage_ (vol. ii, p. 274) there is a\r\n curious account of the effects of a drought on the elephants, at\r\n Benguela (west coast of Africa). “A number of these animals had some\r\n time since entered the town, in a body, to possess themselves of the\r\n wells, not being able to procure any water in the country. The\r\n inhabitants mustered, when a desperate conflict ensued, which\r\n terminated in the ultimate discomfiture of the invaders, but not until\r\n they had killed one man, and wounded several others.” The town is said\r\n to have a population of nearly three thousand! Dr. Malcolmson informs\r\n me, that during a great drought in India the wild animals entered the\r\n tents of some troops at Ellore, and that a hare drank out of a vessel\r\n held by the adjutant of the regiment.)\r\n\r\n\r\n [9] _Travels_, vol. i, p. 374.\r\n\r\n\r\n [10] These droughts to a certain degree seem to be almost periodical;\r\n I was told the dates of several others, and the intervals were about\r\n fifteen years.\r\n\r\n\r\n_October_ 12_th._—I had intended to push my excursion farther, but not\r\nbeing quite well, I was compelled to return by a balandra, or\r\none-masted vessel of about a hundred tons’ burden, which was bound to\r\nBuenos Ayres. As the weather was not fair, we moored early in the day\r\nto a branch of a tree on one of the islands. The Parana is full of\r\nislands, which undergo a constant round of decay and renovation. In the\r\nmemory of the master several large ones had disappeared, and others\r\nagain had been formed and protected by vegetation. They are composed of\r\nmuddy sand, without even the smallest pebble, and were then about four\r\nfeet above the level of the river; but during the periodical floods\r\nthey are inundated. They all present one character; numerous willows\r\nand a few other trees are bound together by a great variety of creeping\r\nplants, thus forming a thick jungle. These thickets afford a retreat\r\nfor capybaras and jaguars. The fear of the latter animal quite\r\ndestroyed all pleasure in scrambling through the woods. This evening I\r\nhad not proceeded a hundred yards, before, finding indubitable signs of\r\nthe recent presence of the tiger, I was obliged to come back. On every\r\nisland there were tracks; and as on the former excursion “el rastro de\r\nlos Indios” had been the subject of conversation, so in this was “el\r\nrastro del tigre.”\r\n\r\nThe wooded banks of the great rivers appear to be the favourite haunts\r\nof the jaguar; but south of the Plata, I was told that they frequented\r\nthe reeds bordering lakes: wherever they are, they seem to require\r\nwater. Their common prey is the capybara, so that it is generally said,\r\nwhere capybaras are numerous there is little danger from the jaguar.\r\nFalconer states that near the southern side of the mouth of the Plata\r\nthere are many jaguars, and that they chiefly live on fish; this\r\naccount I have heard repeated. On the Parana they have killed many\r\nwood-cutters, and have even entered vessels at night. There is a man\r\nnow living in the Bajada, who, coming up from below when it was dark,\r\nwas seized on the deck; he escaped, however, with the loss of the use\r\nof one arm. When the floods drive these animals from the islands, they\r\nare most dangerous. I was told that a few years since a very large one\r\nfound its way into a church at St. Fé: two padres entering one after\r\nthe other were killed, and a third, who came to see what\r\nwas the matter, escaped with difficulty. The beast was destroyed by\r\nbeing shot from a corner of the building which was unroofed. They\r\ncommit also at these times great ravages among cattle and horses. It is\r\nsaid that they kill their prey by breaking their necks. If driven from\r\nthe carcass, they seldom return to it. The Gauchos say that the jaguar,\r\nwhen wandering about at night, is much tormented by the foxes yelping\r\nas they follow him. This is a curious coincidence with the fact which\r\nis generally affirmed of the jackals accompanying, in a similarly\r\nofficious manner, the East Indian tiger. The jaguar is a noisy animal,\r\nroaring much by night, and especially before bad weather.\r\n\r\nOne day, when hunting on the banks of the Uruguay, I was shown certain\r\ntrees, to which these animals constantly recur for the purpose, as it\r\nis said, of sharpening their claws. I saw three well-known trees; in\r\nfront, the bark was worn smooth, as if by the breast of the animal, and\r\non each side there were deep scratches, or rather grooves, extending in\r\nan oblique line, nearly a yard in length. The scars were of different\r\nages. A common method of ascertaining whether a jaguar is in the\r\nneighbourhood is to examine these trees. I imagine this habit of the\r\njaguar is exactly similar to one which may any day be seen in the\r\ncommon cat, as with outstretched legs and exserted claws it scrapes the\r\nleg of a chair; and I have heard of young fruit-trees in an orchard in\r\nEngland having been thus much injured. Some such habit must also be\r\ncommon to the puma, for on the bare hard soil of Patagonia I have\r\nfrequently seen scores so deep that no other animal could have made\r\nthem. The object of this practice is, I believe, to tear off the ragged\r\npoints of their claws, and not, as the Gauchos think, to sharpen them.\r\nThe jaguar is killed, without much difficulty, by the aid of dogs\r\nbaying and driving him up a tree, where he is despatched with bullets.\r\n\r\nOwing to bad weather we remained two days at our moorings. Our only\r\namusement was catching fish for our dinner: there were several kinds,\r\nand all good eating. A fish called the “armado” (a Silurus) is\r\nremarkable from a harsh grating noise which it makes when caught by\r\nhook and line, and which can be distinctly heard when the fish is\r\nbeneath the water. This same fish has the power of firmly catching hold\r\nof any object, such as the blade of an oar or the fishing-line, with\r\nthe strong spine both of its pectoral and dorsal fin. In the evening\r\nthe weather was quite tropical, the thermometer standing at 79°.\r\nNumbers of fireflies were hovering about, and the musquitoes were very\r\ntroublesome. I exposed my hand for five minutes, and it was soon black\r\nwith them; I do not suppose there could have been less than fifty, all\r\nbusy sucking.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n_October_ 15_th._—We got under way and passed Punta Gorda, where there\r\nis a colony of tame Indians from the province of Missiones. We sailed\r\nrapidly down the current, but before sunset, from a silly fear of bad\r\nweather, we brought-to in a narrow arm of the river. I took the boat\r\nand rowed some distance up this creek. It was very narrow, winding, and\r\ndeep; on each side a wall thirty or forty feet high, formed by trees\r\nintwined with creepers, gave to the canal a singularly gloomy\r\nappearance. I here saw a very extraordinary bird, called the\r\nScissor-beak (Rhynchops nigra). It has short legs, web feet, extremely\r\nlong-pointed wings, and is of about the size of a tern.\r\nThe beak is flattened laterally, that is, in a plane at right angles to\r\nthat of a spoonbill or duck. It is as flat and elastic as an ivory\r\npaper-cutter, and the lower mandible, differently from every other\r\nbird, is an inch and a half longer than the upper. In a lake near\r\nMaldonado, from which the water had been nearly drained, and which, in\r\nconsequence, swarmed with small fry, I saw several of these birds,\r\ngenerally in small flocks, flying rapidly backwards and forwards close\r\nto the surface of the lake. They kept their bills wide open, and the\r\nlower mandible half buried in the water. Thus skimming the surface,\r\nthey ploughed it in their course: the water was quite smooth, and it\r\nformed a most curious spectacle to behold a flock, each bird leaving\r\nits narrow wake on the mirror-like surface. In their flight they\r\nfrequently twist about with extreme quickness, and dexterously manage\r\nwith their projecting lower mandible to plough up small fish, which are\r\nsecured by the upper and shorter half of their scissor-like bills. This\r\nfact I repeatedly saw, as, like swallows, they continued to fly\r\nbackwards and forwards close before me. Occasionally when leaving the\r\nsurface of the water their flight was wild, irregular, and rapid; they\r\nthen uttered loud harsh cries. When these birds are fishing, the\r\nadvantage of the long primary feathers of their wings, in keeping them\r\ndry, is very evident. When thus employed, their forms resemble the\r\nsymbol by which many artists represent marine birds. Their tails are\r\nmuch used in steering their irregular course.\r\n\r\nThese birds are common far inland along the course of the Rio Parana;\r\nit is said that they remain here during the whole year, and breed in\r\nthe marshes. During the day they rest in flocks on the grassy plains,\r\nat some distance from the water. Being at anchor, as I have said, in\r\none of the deep creeks between the islands of the Parana, as the\r\nevening drew to a close, one of these scissor-beaks suddenly appeared.\r\nThe water was quite still, and many little fish were rising. The bird\r\ncontinued for a long time to skim the surface, flying in its wild and\r\nirregular manner up and down the narrow canal, now dark with the\r\ngrowing night and the shadows of the overhanging trees. At Monte Video,\r\nI observed that some large flocks during the day remained on the\r\nmud-banks at the head of the harbour, in the same manner as on the\r\ngrassy plains near the Parana; and every evening they took flight\r\nseaward. From\r\nthese facts I suspect that the Rhynchops generally fishes by night, at\r\nwhich time many of the lower animals come most abundantly to the\r\nsurface. M. Lesson states that he has seen these birds opening the\r\nshells of the mactræ buried in the sand-banks on the coast of Chile:\r\nfrom their weak bills, with the lower mandible so much projecting,\r\ntheir short legs and long wings, it is very improbable that this can be\r\na general habit.\r\n\r\nIn our course down the Parana, I observed only three other birds, whose\r\nhabits are worth mentioning. One is a small kingfisher (Ceryle\r\nAmericana); it has a longer tail than the European species, and hence\r\ndoes not sit in so stiff and upright a position. Its flight also,\r\ninstead of being direct and rapid, like the course of an arrow, is weak\r\nand undulatory, as among the soft-billed birds. It utters a low note,\r\nlike the clicking together of two small stones. A small green parrot\r\n(Conurus murinus), with a grey breast, appears to prefer the tall trees\r\non the islands to any other situation for its building-place. A number\r\nof nests are placed so close together as to form one great mass of\r\nsticks. These parrots always live in flocks, and commit great ravages\r\non the corn-fields. I was told that near Colonia 2500 were killed in\r\nthe course of one year. A bird with a forked tail, terminated by two\r\nlong feathers (Tyrannus savana), and named by the Spaniards\r\nscissor-tail, is very common near Buenos Ayres: it commonly sits on a\r\nbranch of the _ ombu_ tree, near a house, and thence takes a short\r\nflight in pursuit of insects, and returns to the same spot. When on the\r\nwing it presents in its manner of flight and general appearance a\r\ncaricature-likeness of the common swallow. It has the power of turning\r\nvery shortly in the air, and in so doing opens and shuts its tail,\r\nsometimes in a horizontal or lateral and sometimes in a vertical\r\ndirection, just like a pair of scissors.\r\n\r\n_October_ 16_th._—Some leagues below Rozario, the western shore of the\r\nParana is bounded by perpendicular cliffs, which extend in a long line\r\nto below San Nicolas; hence it more resembles a sea-coast than that of\r\na fresh-water river. It is a great drawback to the scenery of the\r\nParana, that, from the soft nature of its banks, the water is very\r\nmuddy. The Uruguay, flowing through a granitic country, is much\r\nclearer; and where the two channels unite at the head of the Plata, the\r\nwaters may for a long distance be distinguished by their black and red\r\ncolours. In the evening, the wind being not quite fair, as usual we\r\nimmediately moored, and the next day, as it blew rather freshly, though\r\nwith a favouring current, the master was much too indolent to think of\r\nstarting. At Bajada, he was described to me as “hombre muy aflicto”—a\r\nman always miserable to get on; but certainly he bore all delays with\r\nadmirable resignation. He was an old Spaniard, and had been many years\r\nin this country. He professed a great liking to the English, but\r\nstoutly maintained that the battle of Trafalgar was merely won by the\r\nSpanish captains having been all bought over; and that the only really\r\ngallant action on either side was performed by the Spanish admiral. It\r\nstruck me as rather characteristic, that this man should prefer his\r\ncountrymen being thought the worst of traitors, rather than unskilful\r\nor cowardly.\r\n\r\n18_th and_ 19_th._—We continued slowly to sail down the noble stream:\r\nthe current helped us but little. We met, during our descent, very few\r\nvessels. One of the best gifts of nature, in so grand a channel of\r\ncommunication, seems here wilfully thrown away—a river in which ships\r\nmight navigate from a temperate country, as surprisingly abundant in\r\ncertain productions as destitute of others, to another possessing a\r\ntropical climate, and a soil which, according to the best of judges, M.\r\nBonpland, is perhaps unequalled in fertility in any part of the world.\r\nHow different would have been the aspect of this river if English\r\ncolonists had by good fortune first sailed up the Plata! What noble\r\ntowns would now have occupied its shores! Till the death of Francia,\r\nthe Dictator of Paraguay, these two countries must remain distinct, as\r\nif placed on opposite sides of the globe. And when the old\r\nbloody-minded tyrant is gone to his long account, Paraguay will be torn\r\nby revolutions, violent in proportion to the previous unnatural calm.\r\nThat country will have to learn, like every other South American state,\r\nthat a republic cannot succeed till it contains a certain body of men\r\nimbued with the principles of justice and honour.\r\n\r\n_October_ 20_th._—Being arrived at the mouth of the Parana, and as I\r\nwas very anxious to reach Buenos Ayres, I went on shore at Las Conchas,\r\nwith the intention of riding there. Upon landing, I found to my great\r\nsurprise that I was to a certain degree a prisoner. A violent\r\nrevolution having broken out, all\r\nthe ports were laid under an embargo. I could not return to my vessel,\r\nand as for going by land to the city, it was out of the question. After\r\na long conversation with the commandant, I obtained permission to go\r\nthe next day to General Rolor, who commanded a division of the rebels\r\non this side the capital. In the morning I rode to the encampment. The\r\ngeneral, officers, and soldiers, all appeared, and I believe really\r\nwere, great villains. The general, the very evening before he left the\r\ncity, voluntarily went to the Governor, and with his hand to his heart,\r\npledged his word of honour that he at least would remain faithful to\r\nthe last. The general told me that the city was in a state of close\r\nblockade, and that all he could do was to give me a passport to the\r\ncommander-in-chief of the rebels at Quilmes. We had therefore to take a\r\ngreat sweep round the city, and it was with much difficulty that we\r\nprocured horses. My reception at the encampment was quite civil, but I\r\nwas told it was impossible that I could be allowed to enter the city. I\r\nwas very anxious about this, as I anticipated the _Beagle’s_ departure\r\nfrom the Rio Plata earlier than it took place. Having mentioned,\r\nhowever, General Rosas’s obliging kindness to me when at the Colorado,\r\nmagic itself could not have altered circumstances quicker than did this\r\nconversation. I was instantly told that though they could not give me a\r\npassport, if I chose to leave my guide and horses, I might pass their\r\nsentinels. I was too glad to accept of this, and an officer was sent\r\nwith me to give directions that I should not be stopped at the bridge.\r\nThe road for the space of a league was quite deserted. I met one party\r\nof soldiers, who were satisfied by gravely looking at an old passport:\r\nand at length I was not a little pleased to find myself within the\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nThis revolution was supported by scarcely any pretext of grievances:\r\nbut in a state which, in the course of nine months (from February to\r\nOctober, 1820), underwent fifteen changes in its government—each\r\ngovernor, according to the constitution, being elected for three\r\nyears—it would be very unreasonable to ask for pretexts. In this case,\r\na party of men—who, being attached to Rosas, were disgusted with the\r\ngovernor Balcarce—to the number of seventy left the city, and with the\r\ncry of Rosas the whole country took arms. The city was then blockaded,\r\nno provisions, cattle or horses, were allowed to enter; besides this,\r\nthere was only a little skirmishing, and a few men daily killed. The\r\noutside party well knew that by stopping the supply of meat they would\r\ncertainly be victorious. General Rosas could not have known of this\r\nrising; but it appears to be quite consonant with the plans of his\r\nparty. A year ago he was elected governor, but he refused it, unless\r\nthe Sala would also confer on him extraordinary powers. This was\r\nrefused, and since then his party have shown that no other governor can\r\nkeep his place. The warfare on both sides was avowedly protracted till\r\nit was possible to hear from Rosas. A note arrived a few days after I\r\nleft Buenos Ayres, which stated that the General disapproved of peace\r\nhaving been broken, but that he thought the outside party had justice\r\non their side. On the bare reception of this the Governor, ministers,\r\nand part of the military, to the number of some hundreds, fled from the\r\ncity. The rebels entered, elected a new governor, and were paid for\r\ntheir services to the number of 5500 men. From these proceedings, it\r\nwas clear that Rosas ultimately would become the dictator: to the term\r\nking, the people in this, as in other republics, have a particular\r\ndislike. Since leaving South America, we have heard that Rosas has been\r\nelected, with powers and for a time altogether opposed to the\r\nconstitutional principles of the republic.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VIII\r\n\r\n\r\nExcursion to Colonia del Sacramiento—Value of an Estancia—Cattle, how\r\ncounted—Singular Breed of Oxen—Perforated Pebbles—Shepherd-dogs—Horses\r\nbroken-in, Gauchos Riding—Character of Inhabitants—Rio Plata—Flocks of\r\nButterflies—Aëronaut Spiders—Phosphorescence of the Sea—Port\r\nDesire—Guanaco—Port St. Julian—Geology of Patagonia—Fossil gigantic\r\nAnimal—Types of Organisation constant—Change in the Zoology of\r\nAmerica—Causes of Extinction.\r\n\r\nBANDA ORIENTAL AND PATAGONIA.\r\n\r\nHaving been delayed for nearly a fortnight in the city, I was glad to\r\nescape on board a packet bound for Monte Video. A town in a state of\r\nblockade must always be a disagreeable place of residence; in this case\r\nmoreover there were constant apprehensions from robbers within. The\r\nsentinels were the worst of all; for, from their office and from having\r\narms in their hands, they robbed with a degree of authority which other\r\nmen could not imitate.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur passage was a very long and tedious one. The Plata looks like a\r\nnoble estuary on the map; but is in truth a poor affair. A wide expanse\r\nof muddy water has neither grandeur nor beauty. At one time of the day,\r\nthe two shores, both of which are extremely low, could just be\r\ndistinguished from the deck. On arriving at Monte Video I found that\r\nthe _Beagle_ would not sail for some time, so I prepared for a short\r\nexcursion in this part of Banda Oriental. Everything which I have said\r\nabout the country near Maldonado is applicable to Monte Video; but the\r\nland, with the one exception of the Green Mount, 450 feet high, from\r\nwhich it takes its name, is far more level. Very little of the\r\nundulating grassy plain is enclosed; but near the town there are a few\r\nhedge-banks, covered with agaves, cacti, and fennel.\r\n\r\n_November_ 14_th._—We left Monte Video in the afternoon. I intended to\r\nproceed to Colonia del Sacramiento, situated on the northern bank of\r\nthe Plata and opposite to Buenos Ayres, and thence, following up the\r\nUruguay, to the village of Mercedes on the Rio Negro (one of the many\r\nrivers of this name in South America), and from this point to return\r\ndirect to Monte Video. We slept at the house of my guide at Canelones.\r\nIn the morning we rose early, in the hopes of being able to ride a good\r\ndistance; but it was a vain attempt, for all the rivers were flooded.\r\nWe passed in boats the streams of Canelones, St. Lucia, and San José,\r\nand thus lost much time. On a former excursion I crossed the Lucia near\r\nits mouth, and I was surprised to observe how easily our horses,\r\nalthough not used to swim, passed over a width of at least six hundred\r\nyards. On mentioning this at Monte Video, I was told that a vessel\r\ncontaining some mountebanks and their horses, being wrecked in the\r\nPlata, one horse swam seven miles to the shore. In the course of the\r\nday I was amused by the dexterity with which a Gaucho forced a restive\r\nhorse to swim a river. He stripped off his clothes, and jumping on its\r\nback, rode into the water till it was out of its depth; then slipping\r\noff over the crupper, he caught hold of the tail, and as often as the\r\nhorse turned round the man frightened it back by splashing water in its\r\nface. As soon as the horse touched the bottom on the other side, the\r\nman pulled himself on, and was firmly seated, bridle in hand, before\r\nthe horse gained the bank. A naked man on a naked\r\nhorse is a fine spectacle; I had no idea how well the two animals\r\nsuited each other. The tail of a horse is a very useful appendage; I\r\nhave passed a river in a boat with four people in it, which was ferried\r\nacross in the same way as the Gaucho. If a man and horse have to cross\r\na broad river, the best plan is for the man to catch hold of the pommel\r\nor mane, and help himself with the other arm.\r\n\r\nWe slept and stayed the following day at the post of Cufre. In the\r\nevening the postman or letter-carrier arrived. He was a day after his\r\ntime, owing to the Rio Rozario being flooded. It would not, however, be\r\nof much consequence; for, although he had passed through some of the\r\nprincipal towns in Banda Oriental, his luggage consisted of two\r\nletters! The view from the house was pleasing; an undulating green\r\nsurface, with distant glimpses of the Plata. I find that I look at this\r\nprovince with very different eyes from what I did upon my first\r\narrival. I recollect I then thought it singularly level; but now, after\r\ngalloping over the Pampas, my only surprise is, what could have induced\r\nme ever to have called it level. The country is a series of\r\nundulations, in themselves perhaps not absolutely great, but, as\r\ncompared to the plains of St. Fé, real mountains. From these\r\ninequalities there is an abundance of small rivulets, and the turf is\r\ngreen and luxuriant.\r\n\r\n_November_ 17_th._—We crossed the Rozario, which was deep and rapid,\r\nand passing the village of Colla, arrived at mid-day at Colonia del\r\nSacramiento. The distance is twenty leagues, through a country covered\r\nwith fine grass, but poorly stocked with cattle or inhabitants. I was\r\ninvited to sleep at Colonia, and to accompany on the following day a\r\ngentleman to his estancia, where there were some limestone rocks. The\r\ntown is built on a stony promontory something in the same manner as at\r\nMonte Video. It is strongly fortified, but both fortifications and town\r\nsuffered much in the Brazilian war. It is very ancient; and the\r\nirregularity of the streets, and the surrounding groves of old orange\r\nand peach trees, gave it a pretty appearance. The church is a curious\r\nruin; it was used as a powder-magazine, and was struck by lightning in\r\none of the ten thousand thunderstorms of the Rio Plata. Two-thirds of\r\nthe building were blown away to the very foundation; and the rest\r\nstands a shattered and curious monument of the\r\nunited powers of lightning and gunpowder. In the evening I wandered\r\nabout the half-demolished walls of the town. It was the chief seat of\r\nthe Brazilian war—a war most injurious to this country, not so much in\r\nits immediate effects, as in being the origin of a multitude of\r\ngenerals and all other grades of officers. More generals are numbered\r\n(but not paid) in the United Provinces of La Plata than in the United\r\nKingdom of Great Britain. These gentlemen have learned to like power,\r\nand do not object to a little skirmishing. Hence there are many always\r\non the watch to create disturbance and to overturn a government which\r\nas yet has never rested on any stable foundation. I noticed, however,\r\nboth here and in other places, a very general interest in the ensuing\r\nelection for the President; and this appears a good sign for the\r\nprosperity of this little country. The inhabitants do not require much\r\neducation in their representatives; I heard some men discussing the\r\nmerits of those for Colonia; and it was said that, “although they were\r\nnot men of business, they could all sign their names:” with this they\r\nseemed to think every reasonable man ought to be satisfied.\r\n\r\n18_th._—Rode with my host to his estancia, at the Arroyo de San Juan.\r\nIn the evening we took a ride round the estate: it contained two square\r\nleagues and a half, and was situated in what is called a rincon; that\r\nis, one side was fronted by the Plata, and the two others guarded by\r\nimpassable brooks. There was an excellent port for little vessels, and\r\nan abundance of small wood, which is valuable as supplying fuel to\r\nBuenos Ayres. I was curious to know the value of so complete an\r\nestancia. Of cattle there were 3000, and it would well support three or\r\nfour times that number; of mares 800, together with 150 broken-in\r\nhorses, and 600 sheep. There was plenty of water and limestone, a rough\r\nhouse, excellent corrals, and a peach orchard. For all this he had been\r\noffered £2000, and he only wanted £500 additional, and probably would\r\nsell it for less. The chief trouble with an estancia is driving the\r\ncattle twice a week to a central spot, in order to make them tame, and\r\nto count them. This latter operation would be thought difficult, where\r\nthere are ten or fifteen thousand head together. It is managed on the\r\nprinciple that the cattle invariably divide themselves into little\r\ntroops of from forty to one hundred. Each troop is recognised by a few\r\npeculiarly\r\nmarked animals, and its number is known: so that, one being lost out of\r\nten thousand, it is perceived by its absence from one of the tropillas.\r\nDuring a stormy night the cattle all mingle together; but the next\r\nmorning the tropillas separate as before; so that each animal must know\r\nits fellow out of ten thousand others.\r\n\r\nOn two occasions I met with in this province some oxen of a very\r\ncurious breed, called nãta or niata. They appear externally to hold\r\nnearly the same relation to other cattle, which bull or pug dogs do to\r\nother dogs. Their forehead is very short and broad, with the nasal end\r\nturned up, and the upper lip much drawn back; their lower jaws project\r\nbeyond the upper, and have a corresponding upward curve; hence their\r\nteeth are always exposed. Their nostrils are seated high up and are\r\nvery open; their eyes project outwards. When walking they carry their\r\nheads low, on a short neck; and their hinder legs are rather longer\r\ncompared with the front legs than is usual. Their bare teeth, their\r\nshort heads, and upturned nostrils give them the most ludicrous\r\nself-confident air of defiance imaginable.\r\n\r\nSince my return, I have procured a skeleton head, through the kindness\r\nof my friend Captain Sulivan,  R.N., which is now deposited in the\r\nCollege of Surgeons.[1] Don F. Muniz, of Luxan, has kindly collected\r\nfor me all the information which he could respecting this breed. From\r\nhis account it seems that about eighty or ninety years ago, they were\r\nrare and kept as curiosities at Buenos Ayres. The breed is universally\r\nbelieved to have originated amongst the Indians southward of the Plata;\r\nand that it was with them the commonest kind. Even to this day, those\r\nreared in the provinces near the Plata show their less civilised\r\norigin, in being fiercer than common cattle, and in the cow easily\r\ndeserting her first calf, if visited too often or molested. It is a\r\nsingular fact that an almost similar structure to the abnormal[2] one\r\nof the niata breed, characterises, as I am informed by Dr. Falconer,\r\nthat great extinct ruminant of India, the Sivatherium. The breed is\r\nvery _ true_; and a niata bull and cow invariably produce niata calves.\r\nA niata bull with a common cow, or the reverse cross, produces\r\noffspring having an intermediate character, but with the niata\r\ncharacters strongly displayed: according to Señor Muniz, there is the\r\nclearest evidence, contrary to the common belief of agriculturists in\r\nanalogous cases, that the niata cow when crossed with a common bull\r\ntransmits her peculiarities more strongly than the niata bull when\r\ncrossed with a common cow. When the pasture is tolerably long, the\r\nniata cattle feed with the tongue and palate as well as common cattle;\r\nbut during the great droughts, when so many animals perish, the niata\r\nbreed is under a great disadvantage, and would be exterminated if not\r\nattended to; for the common cattle, like horses, are able just to keep\r\nalive, by browsing with their lips on twigs of trees and reeds; this\r\nthe niatas cannot so well do, as their lips do not join, and hence they\r\nare found to perish before the common cattle. This strikes me as a good\r\nillustration of how little we are able to judge from the ordinary\r\nhabits of life, on what circumstances, occurring only at long\r\nintervals, the rarity or extinction of a species may be determined.\r\n\r\n [1] Mr. Waterhouse has drawn up a detailed description of this head,\r\n which I hope he will publish in some Journal.\r\n\r\n\r\n [2] A nearly similar abnormal, but I do not know whether hereditary,\r\n structure has been observed in the carp, and likewise in the crocodile\r\n of the Ganges: _Histoire des Anomalies_, par M. Isid. Geoffroy St.\r\n Hilaire, tome i, p. 244.\r\n\r\n_November_ 19_th._—Passing the valley of Las Vacas, we slept at a house\r\nof a North American, who worked a lime-kiln on the Arroyo de las\r\nVivoras. In the morning we rode to a projecting headland on the banks\r\nof the river, called Punta Gorda. On the way we tried to find a jaguar.\r\nThere were plenty of fresh tracks, and we visited the trees on which\r\nthey are said to sharpen their claws; but we did not succeed in\r\ndisturbing one. From this point the Rio Uruguay presented to our view a\r\nnoble volume of water. From the clearness and rapidity of the stream,\r\nits appearance was far superior to that of its neighbour the Parana. On\r\nthe opposite coast, several branches from the latter river entered the\r\nUruguay. As the sun was shining, the two colours of the waters could be\r\nseen quite distinct.\r\n\r\nIn the evening we proceeded on our road towards Mercedes on the Rio\r\nNegro. At night we asked permission to sleep at an estancia at which we\r\nhappened to arrive. It was a very large estate, being ten leagues\r\nsquare, and the owner is one of the greatest landowners in the country.\r\nHis nephew had charge of it, and with him there was a captain in the\r\narmy, who the other day ran away from Buenos Ayres. Considering\r\ntheir station, their conversation was rather amusing. They expressed,\r\nas was usual, unbounded astonishment at the globe being round, and\r\ncould scarcely credit that a hole would, if deep enough, come out on\r\nthe other side. They had, however, heard of a country where there were\r\nsix months of light and six of darkness, and where the inhabitants were\r\nvery tall and thin! They were curious about the price and condition of\r\nhorses and cattle in England. Upon finding out we did not catch our\r\nanimals with the lazo, they cried out, “Ah, then, you use nothing but\r\nthe bolas:” the idea of an enclosed country was quite new to them. The\r\ncaptain at last said, he had one question to ask me, which he should be\r\nvery much obliged if I would answer with all truth. I trembled to think\r\nhow deeply scientific it would be: it was, “Whether the ladies of\r\nBuenos Ayres were not the handsomest in the world.” I replied, like a\r\nrenegade, “Charmingly so.” He added, “I have one other question: Do\r\nladies in any other part of the world wear such large combs?” I\r\nsolemnly assured him that they did not. They were absolutely delighted.\r\nThe captain exclaimed, “Look there! a man who has seen half the world\r\nsays it is the case; we always thought so, but now we know it.” My\r\nexcellent judgment in combs and beauty procured me a most hospitable\r\nreception; the captain forced me to take his bed, and he would sleep on\r\nhis recado.\r\n\r\n21_st._—Started at sunrise, and rode slowly during the whole day. The\r\ngeological nature of this part of the province was different from the\r\nrest, and closely resembled that of the Pampas. In consequence, there\r\nwere immense beds of the thistle, as well as of the cardoon: the whole\r\ncountry, indeed, may be called one great bed of these plants. The two\r\nsorts grow separate, each plant in company with its own kind. The\r\ncardoon is as high as a horse’s back, but the Pampas thistle is often\r\nhigher than the crown of the rider’s head. To leave the road for a yard\r\nis out of the question; and the road itself is partly, and in some\r\ncases entirely, closed. Pasture, of course, there is none; if cattle or\r\nhorses once enter the bed, they are for the time completely lost. Hence\r\nit is very hazardous to attempt to drive cattle at this season of the\r\nyear; for when jaded enough to face the thistles, they rush among them,\r\nand are seen no more. In these districts there are very few\r\nestancias, and these few are situated in the neighbourhood of damp\r\nvalleys, where fortunately neither of these overwhelming plants can\r\nexist. As night came on before we arrived at our journey’s end, we\r\nslept at a miserable little hovel inhabited by the poorest people. The\r\nextreme though rather formal courtesy of our host and hostess,\r\nconsidering their grade of life, was quite delightful.\r\n\r\n_November_ 22_nd._—Arrived at an estancia on the Berquelo belonging to\r\na very hospitable Englishman, to whom I had a letter of introduction\r\nfrom my friend Mr. Lumb. I stayed here three days. One morning I rode\r\nwith my host to the Sierra del Pedro Flaco, about twenty miles up the\r\nRio Negro. Nearly the whole country was covered with good though coarse\r\ngrass, which was as high as a horse’s belly; yet there were square\r\nleagues without a single head of cattle. The province of Banda\r\nOriental, if well stocked, would support an astonishing number of\r\nanimals, at present the annual export of hides from Monte Video amounts\r\nto three hundred thousand; and the home consumption, from waste, is\r\nvery considerable. An estanciero told me that he often had to send\r\nlarge herds of cattle a long journey to a salting establishment, and\r\nthat the tired beasts were frequently obliged to be killed and skinned;\r\nbut that he could never persuade the Gauchos to eat of them, and every\r\nevening a fresh beast was slaughtered for their suppers! The view of\r\nthe Rio Negro from the Sierra was more picturesque than any other which\r\nI saw in this province. The river, broad, deep, and rapid, wound at the\r\nfoot of a rocky precipitous cliff: a belt of wood followed its course,\r\nand the horizon terminated in the distant undulations of the\r\nturf-plain.\r\n\r\nWhen in this neighbourhood, I several times heard of the Sierra de las\r\nCuentas: a hill distant many miles to the northward. The name signifies\r\nhill of beads. I was assured that vast numbers of little round stones,\r\nof various colours, each with a small cylindrical hole, are found\r\nthere. Formerly the Indians used to collect them, for the purpose of\r\nmaking necklaces and bracelets—a taste, I may observe, which is common\r\nto all savage nations, as well as to the most polished. I did not know\r\nwhat to understand from this story, but upon mentioning it at the Cape\r\nof Good Hope to Dr. Andrew Smith, he told me that he recollected\r\nfinding on the\r\nsouth-eastern coast of Africa, about one hundred miles to the eastward\r\nof St. John’s river, some quartz crystals with their edges blunted from\r\nattrition, and mixed with gravel on the sea-beach. Each crystal was\r\nabout five lines in diameter, and from an inch to an inch and a half in\r\nlength. Many of them had a small canal extending from one extremity to\r\nthe other, perfectly cylindrical, and of a size that readily admitted a\r\ncoarse thread or a piece of fine catgut. Their colour was red or dull\r\nwhite. The natives were acquainted with this structure in crystals. I\r\nhave mentioned these circumstances because, although no crystallised\r\nbody is at present known to assume this form, it may lead some future\r\ntraveller to investigate the real nature of such stones.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile staying at this estancia, I was amused with what I saw and heard\r\nof the shepherd-dogs of the country.[3] When riding, it is a common\r\nthing to meet a large flock of sheep guarded by one or two dogs, at the\r\ndistance of some miles from any house or man. I often wondered how so\r\nfirm a friendship had been established. The method of education\r\nconsists in separating the puppy, while very young, from the bitch, and\r\nin accustoming it to its future companions. An ewe is held three or\r\nfour times a day for the little thing to suck, and a nest of wool is\r\nmade for it in the sheep-pen; at no time is it allowed to associate\r\nwith other dogs, or with the children of the family. The puppy is,\r\nmoreover, generally castrated; so that, when grown up, it can scarcely\r\nhave any feelings in common with the rest of its kind. From this\r\neducation it has no wish to leave the flock, and just as another dog\r\nwill defend its master, man, so will these the sheep. It is amusing to\r\nobserve, when approaching a flock, how the dog immediately advances\r\nbarking, and the sheep all close in his rear, as if round the oldest\r\nram. These dogs are also easily taught to bring home the flock at a\r\ncertain hour in the evening. Their most troublesome fault, when young,\r\nis their desire of playing with the sheep; for in their sport they\r\nsometimes gallop their poor subjects most unmercifully.\r\n\r\n [3] M. A. d’Orbigny has given nearly a similar account of these dogs,\r\n tome i, p. 175.\r\n\r\nThe shepherd-dog comes to the house every day for some\r\nmeat, and as soon as it is given him, he skulks away as if ashamed of\r\nhimself. On these occasions the house-dogs are very tyrannical, and the\r\nleast of them will attack and pursue the stranger. The minute, however,\r\nthe latter has reached the flock, he turns round and begins to bark,\r\nand then all the house-dogs take very quickly to their heels. In a\r\nsimilar manner a whole pack of the hungry wild dogs will scarcely ever\r\n(and I was told by some never) venture to attack a flock guarded by\r\neven one of these faithful shepherds. The whole account appears to me a\r\ncurious instance of the pliability of the affections in the dog; and\r\nyet, whether wild or however educated, he has a feeling of respect or\r\nfear for those that are fulfilling their instinct of association. For\r\nwe can understand on no principle the wild dogs being driven away by\r\nthe single one with its flock, except that they consider, from some\r\nconfused notion, that the one thus associated gains power, as if in\r\ncompany with its own kind. F. Cuvier has observed that all animals that\r\nreadily enter into domestication consider man as a member of their own\r\nsociety, and thus fulfil their instinct of association. In the above\r\ncase the shepherd-dog ranks the sheep as its fellow-brethren, and thus\r\ngains confidence; and the wild dogs, though knowing that the individual\r\nsheep are not dogs, but are good to eat, yet partly consent to this\r\nview when seeing them in a flock with a shepherd-dog at their head.\r\n\r\nOne evening a “domidor” (a subduer of horses) came for the purpose of\r\nbreaking-in some colts. I will describe the preparatory steps, for I\r\nbelieve they have not been mentioned by other travellers. A troop of\r\nwild young horses is driven into the corral, or large enclosure of\r\nstakes, and the door is shut. We will suppose that one man alone has to\r\ncatch and mount a horse, which as yet had never felt bridle or saddle.\r\nI conceive, except by a Gaucho, such a feat would be utterly\r\nimpracticable. The Gaucho picks out a full-grown colt; and as the beast\r\nrushes round the circus, he throws his lazo so as to catch both the\r\nfront legs. Instantly the horse rolls over with a heavy shock, and\r\nwhilst struggling on the ground, the Gaucho, holding the lazo tight,\r\nmakes a circle, so as to catch one of the hind legs just beneath the\r\nfetlock, and draws it close to the two front legs: he then hitches the\r\nlazo, so that the\r\nthree are bound together. Then sitting on the horse’s neck, he fixes a\r\nstrong bridle, without a bit, to the lower jaw: this he does by passing\r\na narrow thong through the eye-holes at the end of the reins, and\r\nseveral times round both jaw and tongue. The two front legs are now\r\ntied closely together with a strong leathern thong, fastened by a\r\nslip-knot. The lazo, which bound the three together, being then loosed,\r\nthe horse rises with difficulty. The Gaucho, now holding fast the\r\nbridle fixed to the lower jaw, leads the horse outside the corral. If a\r\nsecond man is present (otherwise the trouble is much greater) he holds\r\nthe animal’s head, whilst the first puts on the horsecloths and saddle,\r\nand girths the whole together. During this operation, the horse, from\r\ndread and astonishment at thus being bound round the waist, throws\r\nhimself over and over again on the ground, and, till beaten, is\r\nunwilling to rise. At last, when the saddling is finished, the poor\r\nanimal can hardly breathe from fear, and is white with foam and sweat.\r\nThe man now prepares to mount by pressing heavily on the stirrup, so\r\nthat the horse may not lose its balance; and at the moment that he\r\nthrows his leg over the animal’s back, he pulls the slip-knot binding\r\nthe front legs, and the beast is free. Some “domidors” pull the knot\r\nwhile the animal is lying on the ground, and, standing over the saddle,\r\nallow him to rise beneath them. The horse, wild with dread, gives a few\r\nmost violent bounds, and then starts off at full gallop: when quite\r\nexhausted, the man, by patience, brings him back to the corral, where,\r\nreeking hot and scarcely alive, the poor beast is let free. Those\r\nanimals which will not gallop away, but obstinately throw themselves on\r\nthe ground, are by far the most troublesome. This process is\r\ntremendously severe, but in two or three trials the horse is tamed. It\r\nis not, however, for some weeks that the animal is ridden with the iron\r\nbit and solid ring, for it must learn to associate the will of its\r\nrider with the feel of the rein, before the most powerful bridle can be\r\nof any service.\r\n\r\nAnimals are so abundant in these countries, that humanity and\r\nself-interest are not closely united; therefore I fear it is that the\r\nformer is here scarcely known. One day, riding in the Pampas with a\r\nvery respectable “Estanciero,” my horse, being tired, lagged behind.\r\nThe man often shouted to me to spur him. When I remonstrated that it\r\nwas a pity, for the horse\r\nwas quite exhausted, he cried out, “Why not?—never mind—spur him—it is\r\n_my_ horse.” I had then some difficulty in making him comprehend that\r\nit was for the horse’s sake, and not on his account, that I did not\r\nchoose to use my spurs. He exclaimed, with a look of great surprise,\r\n“Ah, Don Carlos, que cosa!” It was clear that such an idea had never\r\nbefore entered his head.\r\n\r\nThe Gauchos are well known to be perfect riders. The idea of being\r\nthrown, let the horse do what it likes; never enters their head. Their\r\ncriterion of a good rider is, a man who can manage an untamed colt, or\r\nwho, if his horse falls, alights on his own feet, or can perform other\r\nsuch exploits. I have heard of a man betting that he would throw his\r\nhorse down twenty times, and that nineteen times he would not fall\r\nhimself. I recollect seeing a Gaucho riding a very stubborn horse,\r\nwhich three times successively reared so high as to fall backwards with\r\ngreat violence. The man judged with uncommon coolness the proper moment\r\nfor slipping off, not an instant before or after the right time; and as\r\nsoon as the horse got up, the man jumped on his back, and at last they\r\nstarted at a gallop. The Gaucho never appears to exert any muscular\r\nforce. I was one day watching a good rider, as we were galloping along\r\nat a rapid pace, and thought to myself, “Surely if the horse starts,\r\nyou appear so careless on your seat, you must fall.” At this moment a\r\nmale ostrich sprang from its nest right beneath the horse’s nose: the\r\nyoung colt bounded on one side like a stag; but as for the man, all\r\nthat could be said was, that he started and took fright with his horse.\r\n\r\nIn Chile and Peru more pains are taken with the mouth of the horse than\r\nin La Plata, and this is evidently a consequence of the more intricate\r\nnature of the country. In Chile a horse is not considered perfectly\r\nbroken till he can be brought up standing, in the midst of his full\r\nspeed, on any particular spot,—for instance, on a cloak thrown on the\r\nground: or, again, he will charge a wall, and rearing, scrape the\r\nsurface with his hoofs. I have seen an animal bounding with spirit, yet\r\nmerely reined by a forefinger and thumb, taken at full gallop across a\r\ncourtyard, and then made to wheel round the post of a veranda with\r\ngreat speed, but at so equal a distance, that the rider, with\r\noutstretched arm, all the while kept one finger rubbing the post.\r\nThen making a demi-volte in the air, with the other arm outstretched in\r\na like manner, he wheeled round, with astonishing force, in an opposite\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nSuch a horse is well broken; and although this at first may appear\r\nuseless, it is far otherwise. It is only carrying that which is daily\r\nnecessary into perfection. When a bullock is checked and caught by the\r\nlazo, it will sometimes gallop round and round in a circle, and the\r\nhorse being alarmed at the great strain, if not well broken, will not\r\nreadily turn like the pivot of a wheel. In consequence many men have\r\nbeen killed; for if the lazo once takes a twist round a man’s body, it\r\nwill instantly, from the power of the two opposed animals, almost cut\r\nhim in twain. On the same principle the races are managed; the course\r\nis only two or three hundred yards long, the wish being to have horses\r\nthat can make a rapid dash. The racehorses are trained not only to\r\nstand with their hoofs touching a line, but to draw all four feet\r\ntogether, so as at the first spring to bring into play the full action\r\nof the hind-quarters. In Chile I was told an anecdote, which I believe\r\nwas true; and it offers a good illustration of the use of a well-broken\r\nanimal. A respectable man riding one day met two others, one of whom\r\nwas mounted on a horse, which he knew to have been stolen from himself.\r\nHe challenged them; they answered him by drawing their sabres and\r\ngiving chase. The man, on his good and fleet beast, kept just ahead: as\r\nhe passed a thick bush he wheeled round it, and brought up his horse to\r\na dead check. The pursuers were obliged to shoot on one side and ahead.\r\nThen instantly dashing on, right behind them, he buried his knife in\r\nthe back of one, wounded the other, recovered his horse from the dying\r\nrobber, and rode home. For these feats of horsemanship two things are\r\nnecessary: a most severe bit, like the Mameluke, the power of which,\r\nthough seldom used, the horse knows full well; and large blunt spurs,\r\nthat can be applied either as a mere touch, or as an instrument of\r\nextreme pain. I conceive that with English spurs, the slightest touch\r\nof which pricks the skin, it would be impossible to break in a horse\r\nafter the South American fashion.\r\n\r\nAt an estancia near Las Vacas large numbers of mares are weekly\r\nslaughtered for the sake of their hides, although worth only five paper\r\ndollars, or about half a crown apiece. It seems\r\nat first strange that it can answer to kill mares for such a trifle;\r\nbut as it is thought ridiculous in this country ever to break in or\r\nride a mare, they are of no value except for breeding. The only thing\r\nfor which I ever saw mares used, was to tread out wheat from the ear,\r\nfor which purpose they were driven round a circular enclosure, where\r\nthe wheat-sheaves were strewed. The man employed for slaughtering the\r\nmares happened to be celebrated for his dexterity with the lazo.\r\nStanding at the distance of twelve yards from the mouth of the corral,\r\nhe has laid a wager that he would catch by the legs every animal,\r\nwithout missing one, as it rushed past him. There was another man who\r\nsaid he would enter the corral on foot, catch a mare, fasten her front\r\nlegs together, drive her out, throw her down, kill, skin, and stake the\r\nhide for drying (which latter is a tedious job); and he engaged that he\r\nwould perform this whole operation on twenty-two animals in one day. Or\r\nhe would kill and take the skin off fifty in the same time. This would\r\nhave been a prodigious task, for it is considered a good day’s work to\r\nskin and stake the hides of fifteen or sixteen animals.\r\n\r\n_November_ 26_th._—I set out on my return in a direct line for Monte\r\nVideo. Having heard of some giant’s bones at a neighbouring farmhouse\r\non the Sarandis, a small stream entering the Rio Negro, I rode there\r\naccompanied by my host, and purchased for the value of eighteenpence\r\nthe head of the Toxodon.[4] When found it was quite perfect; but the\r\nboys knocked out some of the teeth with stones, and then set up the\r\nhead as a mark to throw at. By a most fortunate chance I found a\r\nperfect tooth, which exactly fitted one of the sockets in this skull,\r\nembedded by itself on the banks of the Rio Tercero, at the distance of\r\nabout 180 miles from this place. I found remains of this extraordinary\r\nanimal at two other places, so that it must formerly have been common.\r\nI found here, also, some large portions of the armour of a gigantic\r\narmadillo-like animal, and part of the great head of a Mylodon. The\r\nbones of this head are so fresh, that they contain, according to the\r\nanalysis by Mr. T. Reeks, seven per cent of animal matter; and when\r\nplaced in a spirit-lamp, they burn with a small flame.\r\nThe number of the remains embedded in the grand estuary deposit which\r\nforms the Pampas and covers the granitic rocks of Banda Oriental, must\r\nbe extraordinarily great. I believe a straight line drawn in any\r\ndirection through the Pampas would cut through some skeleton or bones.\r\nBesides those which I found during my short excursions, I heard of many\r\nothers, and the origin of such names as “the stream of the animal,”\r\n“the hill of the giant,” is obvious. At other times I heard of the\r\nmarvellous property of certain rivers, which had the power of changing\r\nsmall bones into large; or, as some maintained, the bones themselves\r\ngrew. As far as I am aware, not one of these animals perished, as was\r\nformerly supposed, in the marshes or muddy river-beds of the present\r\nland, but their bones have been exposed by the streams intersecting the\r\nsubaqueous deposit in which they were originally embedded. We may\r\nconclude that the whole area of the Pampas is one wide sepulchre of\r\nthese extinct gigantic quadrupeds.\r\n\r\n [4] I must express my obligation to Mr. Keane, at whose house I was\r\n staying on the Berquelo, and to Mr. Lumb at Buenos Ayres, for without\r\n their assistance these valuable remains would never have reached\r\n England.\r\n\r\nBy the middle of the day, on the 28th, we arrived at Monte Video,\r\nhaving been two days and a half on the road. The country for the whole\r\nway was of a very uniform character, some parts being rather more rocky\r\nand hilly than near the Plata. Not far from Monte Video we passed\r\nthrough the village of Las Pietras, so named from some large rounded\r\nmasses of syenite. Its appearance was rather pretty. In this country a\r\nfew fig-trees round a group of houses, and a site elevated a hundred\r\nfeet above the general level, ought always to be called picturesque.\r\n\r\nDuring the last six months I have had an opportunity of seeing a little\r\nof the character of the inhabitants of these provinces. The Gauchos, or\r\ncountrymen, are very superior to those who reside in the towns. The\r\nGaucho is invariably most obliging, polite, and hospitable: I did not\r\nmeet with even one instance of rudeness or inhospitality. He is modest,\r\nboth respecting himself and country, but at the same time a spirited,\r\nbold fellow. On the other hand, many robberies are committed, and there\r\nis much bloodshed: the habit of constantly wearing the knife is the\r\nchief cause of the latter. It is lamentable to hear how many lives are\r\nlost in trifling quarrels. In fighting, each party tries to mark the\r\nface of his adversary by slashing\r\nhis nose or eyes; as is often attested by deep and horrid-looking\r\nscars. Robberies are a natural consequence of universal gambling, much\r\ndrinking, and extreme indolence. At Mercedes I asked two men why they\r\ndid not work. One gravely said the days were too long; the other that\r\nhe was too poor. The number of horses and the profusion of food are the\r\ndestruction of all industry. Moreover, there are so many feast-days;\r\nand again, nothing can succeed without it be begun when the moon is on\r\nthe increase; so that half the month is lost from these two causes.\r\n\r\nPolice and justice are quite inefficient. If a man who is poor commits\r\nmurder and is taken, he will be imprisoned, and perhaps even shot; but\r\nif he is rich and has friends, he may rely on it no very severe\r\nconsequence will ensue. It is curious that the most respectable\r\ninhabitants of the country invariably assist a murderer to escape: they\r\nseem to think that the individual sins against the government, and not\r\nagainst the people. A traveller has no protection besides his firearms;\r\nand the constant habit of carrying them is the main check to more\r\nfrequent robberies.\r\n\r\nThe character of the higher and more educated classes who reside in the\r\ntowns, partakes, but perhaps in a lesser degree, of the good parts of\r\nthe Gaucho, but is, I fear, stained by many vices of which he is free.\r\nSensuality, mockery of all religion, and the grossest corruption, are\r\nfar from uncommon. Nearly every public officer can be bribed. The head\r\nman in the post-office sold forged government franks. The governor and\r\nprime minister openly combined to plunder the State. Justice, where\r\ngold came into play, was hardly expected by any one. I knew an\r\nEnglishman who went to the Chief Justice (he told me that, not then\r\nunderstanding the ways of the place, he trembled as he entered the\r\nroom), and said, “Sir, I have come to offer you two hundred (paper)\r\ndollars (value about five pounds sterling) if you will arrest before a\r\ncertain time a man who has cheated me. I know it is against the law,\r\nbut my lawyer (naming him) recommended me to take this step.” The Chief\r\nJustice smiled acquiescence, thanked him, and the man before night was\r\nsafe in prison. With this entire want of principle in many of the\r\nleading men, with the country full of ill-paid turbulent officers, the\r\npeople yet hope that a democratic form of government can succeed!\r\n\r\n\r\nOn first entering society in these countries, two or three features\r\nstrike one as particularly remarkable. The polite and dignified manners\r\npervading every rank of life, the excellent taste displayed by the\r\nwomen in their dresses, and the equality amongst all ranks. At the Rio\r\nColorado some men who kept the humblest shops used to dine with General\r\nRosas. A son of a major at Bahia Blanca gained his livelihood by making\r\npaper cigars, and he wished to accompany me, as guide or servant, to\r\nBuenos Ayres, but his father objected on the score of the danger alone.\r\nMany officers in the army can neither read nor write, yet all meet in\r\nsociety as equals. In Entre Rios, the Sala consisted of only six\r\nrepresentatives. One of them kept a common shop, and evidently was not\r\ndegraded by the office. All this is what would be expected in a new\r\ncountry; nevertheless the absence of gentlemen by profession appears to\r\nan Englishman something strange.\r\n\r\nWhen speaking of these countries, the manner in which they have been\r\nbrought up by their unnatural parent, Spain, should always be borne in\r\nmind. On the whole, perhaps, more credit is due for what has been done,\r\nthan blame for that which may be deficient. It is impossible to doubt\r\nbut that the extreme liberalism of these countries must ultimately lead\r\nto good results. The very general toleration of foreign religions, the\r\nregard paid to the means of education, the freedom of the press, the\r\nfacilities offered to all foreigners, and especially, as I am bound to\r\nadd, to every one professing the humblest pretensions to science,\r\nshould be recollected with gratitude by those who have visited Spanish\r\nSouth America.\r\n\r\n\r\n_December_ 6_th._—The _Beagle_ sailed from the Rio Plata, never again\r\nto enter its muddy stream. Our course was directed to Port Desire, on\r\nthe coast of Patagonia. Before proceeding any farther, I will here put\r\ntogether a few observations made at sea.\r\n\r\nSeveral times when the ship has been some miles off the mouth of the\r\nPlata, and at other times when off the shores of Northern Patagonia, we\r\nhave been surrounded by insects. One evening, when we were about ten\r\nmiles from the Bay of San Blas, vast numbers of butterflies, in bands\r\nor flocks of countless myriads, extended as far as the eye could range.\r\nEven by the\r\naid of a telescope it was not possible to see a space free from\r\nbutterflies. The seamen cried out “it was snowing butterflies,” and\r\nsuch in fact was the appearance. More species than one were present,\r\nbut the main part belonged to a kind very similar to, but not identical\r\nwith, the common English Colias edusa. Some moths and hymenoptera\r\naccompanied the butterflies; and a fine beetle (Calosoma) flew on\r\nboard. Other instances are known of this beetle having been caught far\r\nout at sea; and this is the more remarkable, as the greater number of\r\nthe Carabidæ seldom or never take wing. The day had been fine and\r\ncalm, and the one previous to it equally so, with light and variable\r\nairs. Hence we cannot suppose that the insects were blown off the land,\r\nbut we must conclude that they voluntarily took flight. The great bands\r\nof the Colias seem at first to afford an instance like those on record\r\nof the migrations of another butterfly, Vanessa cardui;[5] but the\r\npresence of other insects makes the case distinct, and even less\r\nintelligible. Before sunset a strong breeze sprung up from the north,\r\nand this must have caused tens of thousands of the butterflies and\r\nother insects to have perished.\r\n\r\n [5] Lyell’s _Principles of Geology_, vol. iii, p. 63.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion, when seventeen miles off Cape Corrientes, I had a\r\nnet overboard to catch pelagic animals. Upon drawing it up, to my\r\nsurprise I found a considerable number of beetles in it, and although\r\nin the open sea, they did not appear much injured by the salt water. I\r\nlost some of the specimens, but those which I preserved belonged to the\r\ngenera Colymbetes, Hydroporus, Hydrobius (two species), Notaphus,\r\nCynucus, Adimonia, and Scarabæus. At first I thought that these\r\ninsects had been blown from the shore; but upon reflecting that out of\r\nthe eight species four were aquatic, and two others partly so in their\r\nhabits, it appeared to me most probable that they were floated into the\r\nsea by a small stream which drains a lake near Cape Corrientes. On any\r\nsupposition it is an interesting circumstance to find live insects\r\nswimming in the open ocean seventeen miles from the nearest point of\r\nland. There are several accounts of insects having been blown off the\r\nPatagonian shore. Captain Cook observed it, as did more lately Captain\r\nKing of the _Adventure_. The cause probably is due to the want of\r\nshelter, both of trees and hills, so that an\r\ninsect on the wing with an offshore breeze, would be very apt to be\r\nblown out to sea. The most remarkable instance I have known of an\r\ninsect being caught far from the land, was that of a large grasshopper\r\n(Acrydium), which flew on board, when the “Beagle” was to windward of\r\nthe Cape de Verd Islands, and when the nearest point of land, not\r\ndirectly opposed to the trade-wind, was Cape Blanco on the coast of\r\nAfrica, 370 miles distant.[6]\r\n\r\n [6] The flies which frequently accompany a ship for some days on its\r\n passage from harbour to harbour, wandering from the vessel, are soon\r\n lost, and all disappear.\r\n\r\nOn several occasions, when the _Beagle_ has been within the mouth of\r\nthe Plata, the rigging has been coated with the web of the Gossamer\r\nSpider. One day (November 1st, 1832) I paid particular attention to\r\nthis subject. The weather had been fine and clear, and in the morning\r\nthe air was full of patches of the flocculent web, as on an autumnal\r\nday in England. The ship was sixty miles distant from the land, in the\r\ndirection of a steady though light breeze. Vast numbers of a small\r\nspider, about one-tenth of an inch in length, and of a dusky red\r\ncolour, were attached to the webs. There must have been, I should\r\nsuppose, some thousands on the ship. The little spider, when first\r\ncoming in contact with the rigging, was always seated on a single\r\nthread, and not on the flocculent mass. This latter seems merely to be\r\nproduced by the entanglement of the single threads. The spiders were\r\nall of one species, but of both sexes, together with young ones. These\r\nlatter were distinguished by their smaller size and more dusky colour.\r\nI will not give the description of this spider, but merely state that\r\nit does not appear to me to be included in any of Latreille’s genera.\r\nThe little aëronaut as soon as it arrived on board was very active,\r\nrunning about, sometimes letting itself fall, and then reascending the\r\nsame thread; sometimes employing itself in making a small and very\r\nirregular mesh in the corners between the ropes. It could run with\r\nfacility on the surface of water. When disturbed it lifted up its front\r\nlegs, in the attitude of attention. On its first arrival it appeared\r\nvery thirsty, and with exserted maxillæ drank eagerly of drops of\r\nwater; this same circumstance has been observed by Strack: may it not\r\nbe in consequence of the little insect having passed through a dry and\r\nrarefied atmosphere? Its stock of web seemed inexhaustible. While\r\nwatching some that were suspended by a single thread, I several times\r\nobserved that the slightest breath of air bore them away out of sight,\r\nin a horizontal line. On another occasion (25th) under similar\r\ncircumstances, I repeatedly observed the same kind of small spider,\r\neither when placed or having crawled on some little eminence, elevate\r\nits abdomen, send forth a thread, and then sail away horizontally, but\r\nwith a rapidity which was quite unaccountable. I thought I could\r\nperceive that the spider, before performing the above preparatory\r\nsteps, connected its legs together with the most delicate threads, but\r\nI am not sure whether this observation was correct.\r\n\r\nOne day, at St. Fé, I had a better opportunity of observing some\r\nsimilar facts. A spider which was about three-tenths of an inch in\r\nlength, and which in its general appearance resembled a Citigrade\r\n(therefore quite different from the gossamer), while standing on the\r\nsummit of a post, darted forth four or five threads from its spinners.\r\nThese, glittering in the sunshine, might be compared to diverging rays\r\nof light; they were not, however, straight, but in undulations like\r\nfilms of silk blown by the wind. They were more than a yard in length,\r\nand diverged in an ascending direction from the orifices. The spider\r\nthen suddenly let go its hold of the post, and was quickly borne out of\r\nsight. The day was hot and apparently quite calm; yet under such\r\ncircumstances, the atmosphere can never be so tranquil as not to affect\r\na vane so delicate as the thread of a spider’s web. If during a warm\r\nday we look either at the shadow of any object cast on a bank, or over\r\na level plain at a distant landmark, the effect of an ascending current\r\nof heated air is almost always evident: such upward currents, it has\r\nbeen remarked, are also shown by the ascent of soap-bubbles, which will\r\nnot rise in an indoors room. Hence I think there is not much difficulty\r\nin understanding the ascent of the fine lines projected from a spider’s\r\nspinners, and afterwards of the spider itself; the divergence of the\r\nlines has been attempted to be explained, I believe by Mr. Murray, by\r\ntheir similar electrical condition. The circumstance of spiders of the\r\nsame species, but of different sexes and ages, being found on several\r\noccasions at the distance of many leagues from the land, attached in\r\nvast numbers to the lines, renders it probable that the habit of\r\nsailing through the air is as characteristic of\r\nthis tribe, as that of diving is of the Argyroneta. We may then reject\r\nLatreille’s supposition, that the gossamer owes its origin\r\nindifferently to the young of several genera of spiders: although, as\r\nwe have seen, the young of other spiders do possess the power of\r\nperforming aërial voyages.[7]\r\n\r\n [7] Mr. Blackwall, in his _Researches in Zoology_, has many excellent\r\n observations on the habits of spiders.\r\n\r\nDuring our different passages south of the Plata, I often towed astern\r\na net made of bunting, and thus caught many curious animals. Of\r\nCrustacea there were many strange and undescribed genera. One, which in\r\nsome respects is allied to the Notopods (or those crabs which have\r\ntheir posterior legs placed almost on their backs, for the purpose of\r\nadhering to the under side of rocks), is very remarkable from the\r\nstructure of its hind pair of legs. The penultimate joint, instead of\r\nterminating in a simple claw, ends in three bristle-like appendages of\r\ndissimilar lengths—the longest equalling that of the entire leg. These\r\nclaws are very thin, and are serrated with the finest teeth, directed\r\nbackwards: their curved extremities are flattened, and on this part\r\nfive most minute cups are placed which seem to act in the same manner\r\nas the suckers on the arms of the cuttle-fish. As the animal lives in\r\nthe open sea, and probably wants a place of rest, I suppose this\r\nbeautiful and most anomalous structure is adapted to take hold of\r\nfloating marine animals.\r\n\r\nIn deep water, far from the land, the number of living creatures is\r\nextremely small: south of the latitude 35°, I never succeeded in\r\ncatching anything besides some beroe, and a few species of minute\r\nentomostracous crustacea. In shoaler water, at the distance of a few\r\nmiles from the coast, very many kinds of crustacea and some other\r\nanimals are numerous, but only during the night. Between latitudes 56°\r\nand 57° south of Cape Horn, the net was put astern several times; it\r\nnever, however, brought up anything besides a few of two extremely\r\nminute species of Entomostraca. Yet whales and seals, petrels and\r\nalbatross, are exceedingly abundant throughout this part of the ocean.\r\nIt has always been a mystery to me on what the albatross, which lives\r\nfar from the shore, can subsist; I presume that, like the condor, it is\r\nable to fast long; and that one good feast on the carcass of a putrid\r\nwhale lasts for a long\r\ntime. The central and intertropical parts of the Atlantic swarm with\r\nPteropoda, Crustacea, and Radiata, and with their devourers the\r\nflying-fish, and again with their devourers the bonitos and albicores;\r\nI presume that the numerous lower pelagic animals feed on the\r\nInfusoria, which are now known, from the researches of Ehrenberg, to\r\nabound in the open ocean: but on what, in the clear blue water, do\r\nthese Infusoria subsist?\r\n\r\nWhile sailing a little south of the Plata on one very dark night, the\r\nsea presented a wonderful and most beautiful spectacle. There was a\r\nfresh breeze, and every part of the surface, which during the day is\r\nseen as foam, now glowed with a pale light. The vessel drove before her\r\nbows two billows of liquid phosphorus, and in her wake she was followed\r\nby a milky train. As far as the eye reached, the crest of every wave\r\nwas bright, and the sky above the horizon, from the reflected glare of\r\nthese livid flames, was not so utterly obscure as over the vault of the\r\nheavens.\r\n\r\nAs we proceed farther southward the sea is seldom phosphorescent; and\r\noff Cape Horn I do not recollect more than once having seen it so, and\r\nthen it was far from being brilliant. This circumstance probably has a\r\nclose connection with the scarcity of organic beings in that part of\r\nthe ocean. After the elaborate paper[8] by Ehrenberg, on the\r\nphosphorescence of the sea, it is almost superfluous on my part to make\r\nany observations on the subject. I may however add, that the same torn\r\nand irregular particles of gelatinous matter, described by Ehrenberg,\r\nseem in the southern as well as in the northern hemisphere to be the\r\ncommon cause of this phenomenon. The particles were so minute as easily\r\nto pass through fine gauze; yet many were distinctly visible by the\r\nnaked eye. The water when placed in a tumbler and agitated gave out\r\nsparks, but a small portion in a watch-glass scarcely ever was\r\nluminous. Ehrenberg states that these particles all retain a certain\r\ndegree of irritability. My observations, some of which were made\r\ndirectly after taking up the water, gave a different result. I may also\r\nmention, that having used the net during one night, I allowed it to\r\nbecome partially dry, and having occasion twelve hours afterwards to\r\nemploy it again, I found\r\nthe whole surface sparkled as brightly as when first taken out of the\r\nwater. It does not appear probable in this case that the particles\r\ncould have remained so long alive. On one occasion having kept a\r\njelly-fish of the genus Dianæa till it was dead, the water in which it\r\nwas placed became luminous. When the waves scintillate with bright\r\ngreen sparks, I believe it is generally owing to minute crustacea. But\r\nthere can be no doubt that very many other pelagic animals, when alive,\r\nare phosphorescent.\r\n\r\n [8] An abstract is given in No. IV of the _ Magazine of Zoology and\r\n Botany._\r\n\r\nOn two occasions I have observed the sea luminous at considerable\r\ndepths beneath the surface. Near the mouth of the Plata some circular\r\nand oval patches, from two to four yards in diameter, and with defined\r\noutlines, shone with a steady but pale light; while the surrounding\r\nwater only gave out a few sparks. The appearance resembled the\r\nreflection of the moon, or some luminous body; for the edges were\r\nsinuous from the undulations of the surface. The ship, which drew\r\nthirteen feet water, passed over, without disturbing these patches.\r\nTherefore we must suppose that some animals were congregated together\r\nat a greater depth than the bottom of the vessel.\r\n\r\nNear Fernando Noronha the sea gave out light in flashes. The appearance\r\nwas very similar to that which might be expected from a large fish\r\nmoving rapidly through a luminous fluid. To this cause the sailors\r\nattributed it; at the time, however, I entertained some doubts, on\r\naccount of the frequency and rapidity of the flashes. I have already\r\nremarked that the phenomenon is very much more common in warm than in\r\ncold countries; and I have sometimes imagined that a disturbed\r\nelectrical condition of the atmosphere was most favourable to its\r\nproduction. Certainly I think the sea is most luminous after a few days\r\nof more calm weather than ordinary, during which time it has swarmed\r\nwith various animals. Observing that the water charged with gelatinous\r\nparticles is in an impure state, and that the luminous appearance in\r\nall common cases is produced by the agitation of the fluid in contact\r\nwith the atmosphere, I am inclined to consider that the phosphorescence\r\nis the result of the decomposition of the organic particles, by which\r\nprocess (one is tempted almost to call it a kind of respiration) the\r\nocean becomes purified.\r\n\r\n\r\n_December_ 23_rd._—We arrived at Port Desire, situated in lat. 47°, on\r\nthe coast of Patagonia. The creek runs for about twenty miles inland,\r\nwith an irregular width. The _ Beagle_ anchored a few miles within the\r\nentrance, in front of the ruins of an old Spanish settlement.\r\n\r\nThe same evening I went on shore. The first landing in any new country\r\nis very interesting, and especially when, as in this case, the whole\r\naspect bears the stamp of a marked and individual character. At the\r\nheight of between two and three hundred feet above some masses of\r\nporphyry a wide plain extends, which is truly characteristic of\r\nPatagonia. The surface is quite level, and is composed of well-rounded\r\nshingle mixed with a whitish earth. Here and there scattered tufts of\r\nbrown wiry grass are supported, and still more rarely, some low thorny\r\nbushes. The weather is dry and pleasant, and the fine blue sky is but\r\nseldom obscured. When standing in the middle of one of these desert\r\nplains and looking towards the interior, the view is generally bounded\r\nby the escarpment of another plain, rather higher, but equally level\r\nand desolate; and in every other direction the horizon is indistinct\r\nfrom the trembling mirage which seems to rise from the heated surface.\r\n\r\nIn such a country the fate of the Spanish settlement was soon decided;\r\nthe dryness of the climate during the greater part of the year, and the\r\noccasional hostile attacks of the wandering Indians, compelled the\r\ncolonists to desert their half-finished buildings. The style, however,\r\nin which they were commenced shows the strong and liberal hand of Spain\r\nin the old time. The result of all the attempts to colonise this side\r\nof America south of 41° has been miserable. Port Famine expresses by\r\nits name the lingering and extreme sufferings of several hundred\r\nwretched people, of whom one alone survived to relate their\r\nmisfortunes. At St. Joseph’s Bay, on the coast of Patagonia, a small\r\nsettlement was made; but during one Sunday the Indians made an attack\r\nand massacred the whole party, excepting two men, who remained captives\r\nduring many years. At the Rio Negro I conversed with one of these men,\r\nnow in extreme old age.\r\n\r\nThe zoology of Patagonia is as limited as its Flora.[9] On\r\nthe arid plains a few black beetles (Heteromera) might be seen slowly\r\ncrawling about, and occasionally a lizard darted from side to side. Of\r\nbirds we have three carrion hawks, and in the valleys a few finches and\r\ninsect-feeders. An ibis (Theristicus melanops—a species said to be\r\nfound in central Africa) is not uncommon on the most desert parts: in\r\ntheir stomachs I found grasshoppers, cicadæ, small lizards, and even\r\nscorpions.[10] At one time of the year these birds go in flocks, at\r\nanother in pairs, their cry is very loud and singular, like the\r\nneighing of the guanaco.\r\n\r\n [9] I found here a species of cactus, described by Professor Henslow,\r\n under the name of _Opuntia Darwinii (Magazine of Zoology and Botany)_,\r\n vol. i, p. 466, which was remarkable for the irritability of the\r\n stamens, when I inserted either a piece of stick or the end of my\r\n finger in the flower. The segments of the perianth also closed on the\r\n pistil, but more slowly than the stamens. Plants of this family,\r\n generally considered as tropical, occur in North America (_Lewis and\r\n Clarke’s Travels_, p. 221), in the same high latitude as here, namely,\r\n in both cases, in 47°.\r\n\r\n\r\n [10] These insects were not uncommon beneath stones. I found one\r\n cannibal scorpion quietly devouring another.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe guanaco, or wild llama, is the characteristic quadruped of the\r\nplains of Patagonia; it is the South American representative of the\r\ncamel of the East. It is an elegant animal in a state of nature, with a\r\nlong slender neck and fine legs. It is very common over the whole of\r\nthe temperate parts of the continent, as far south as the islands near\r\nCape Horn. It generally lives in small herds of from half a dozen to\r\nthirty in each; but on the banks of the St. Cruz we saw one herd which\r\nmust have contained at least five hundred.\r\n\r\nThey are generally wild and extremely wary. Mr. Stokes\r\ntold me that he one day saw through a glass a herd of these animals\r\nwhich evidently had been frightened, and were running away at full\r\nspeed, although their distance was so great that he could not\r\ndistinguish them with his naked eye. The sportsman frequently receives\r\nthe first notice of their presence, by hearing from a long distance\r\ntheir peculiar shrill neighing note of alarm. If he then looks\r\nattentively, he will probably see the herd standing in a line on the\r\nside of some distant hill. On approaching nearer, a few more squeals\r\nare given, and off they set at an apparently slow, but really quick\r\ncanter, along some narrow beaten track to a neighbouring hill. If,\r\nhowever, by chance he abruptly meets a single animal, or several\r\ntogether, they will generally stand motionless and intently gaze at\r\nhim; then perhaps move on a few yards, turn round, and look again. What\r\nis the cause of this difference in their shyness? Do they mistake a man\r\nin the distance for their chief enemy the puma? Or does curiosity\r\novercome their timidity? That they are curious is certain; for if a\r\nperson lies on the ground, and plays strange antics, such as throwing\r\nup his feet in the air, they will almost always approach by degrees to\r\nreconnoitre him. It was an artifice that was repeatedly practised by\r\nour sportsmen with success, and it had moreover the advantage of\r\nallowing several shots to be fired, which were all taken as parts of\r\nthe performance. On the mountains of Tierra del Fuego, I have more than\r\nonce seen a guanaco, on being approached, not only neigh and squeal,\r\nbut prance and leap about in the most ridiculous manner, apparently in\r\ndefiance as a challenge. These animals are very easily domesticated,\r\nand I have seen some thus kept in Northern Patagonia near a house,\r\nthough not under any restraint. They are in this state very bold, and\r\nreadily attack a man by striking him from behind with both knees. It is\r\nasserted that the motive for these attacks is jealousy on account of\r\ntheir females. The wild guanacos, however, have no idea of defence;\r\neven a single dog will secure one of these large animals, till the\r\nhuntsman can come up. In many of their habits they are like sheep in a\r\nflock. Thus when they see men approaching in several directions on\r\nhorseback, they soon become bewildered, and know not which way to run.\r\nThis greatly facilitates the Indian method of hunting, for they are\r\nthus easily driven to a central point, and are encompassed.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe guanacos readily take to the water: several times at Port Valdes\r\nthey were seen swimming from island to island. Byron, in his voyage,\r\nsays he saw them drinking salt water. Some of our officers likewise saw\r\na herd apparently drinking the briny fluid from a salina near Cape\r\nBlanco. I imagine in several parts of the country, if they do not drink\r\nsalt water, they drink none at all. In the middle of the day they\r\nfrequently roll in the dust, in saucer-shaped hollows. The males fight\r\ntogether; two one day passed quite close to me, squealing and trying to\r\nbite each other; and several were shot with their hides deeply scored.\r\nHerds sometimes appear to set out on exploring parties: at Bahia\r\nBlanca, where, within thirty miles of the coast, these animals are\r\nextremely unfrequent, I one day saw the tracks of thirty or forty,\r\nwhich had come in a direct line to a muddy salt-water creek. They then\r\nmust have perceived that they were approaching the sea, for they had\r\nwheeled with the regularity of cavalry, and had returned back in as\r\nstraight a line as they had advanced. The guanacos have one singular\r\nhabit, which is to me quite inexplicable; namely, that on successive\r\ndays they drop their dung in the same defined heap. I saw one of these\r\nheaps which was eight feet in diameter, and was composed of a large\r\nquantity. This habit, according to M. A. d’Orbigny, is common to all\r\nthe species of the genus; it is very useful to the Peruvian Indians,\r\nwho use the dung for fuel, and are thus saved the trouble of collecting\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe guanacos appear to have favourite spots for lying down to die. On\r\nthe banks of the St. Cruz, in certain circumscribed spaces, which were\r\ngenerally bushy and all near the river, the ground was actually white\r\nwith bones. On one such spot I counted between ten and twenty heads. I\r\nparticularly examined the bones; they did not appear, as some scattered\r\nones which I had seen, gnawed or broken, as if dragged together by\r\nbeasts of prey. The animals in most cases must have crawled, before\r\ndying, beneath and amongst the bushes. Mr. Bynoe informs me that during\r\na former voyage he observed the same circumstance on the banks of the\r\nRio Gallegos. I do not at all understand the reason of this, but I may\r\nobserve, that the wounded guanacos at the St. Cruz invariably walked\r\ntowards the river. At St. Jago in the Cape de Verd Islands, I remember\r\nhaving seen in a ravine a retired corner covered with bones of the\r\ngoat; we\r\nat the time exclaimed that it was the burial-ground of all the goats in\r\nthe island. I mention these trifling circumstances, because in certain\r\ncases they might explain the occurrence of a number of uninjured bones\r\nin a cave, or buried under alluvial accumulations; and likewise the\r\ncause why certain animals are more commonly embedded than others in\r\nsedimentary deposits.\r\n\r\nOne day the yawl was sent under the command of Mr. Chaffers with three\r\ndays’ provisions to survey the upper part of the harbour. In the\r\nmorning we searched for some watering-places mentioned in an old\r\nSpanish chart. We found one creek, at the head of which there was a\r\ntrickling rill (the first we had seen) of brackish water. Here the tide\r\ncompelled us to wait several hours; and in the interval I walked some\r\nmiles into the interior. The plain as usual consisted of gravel,\r\nmingled with soil resembling chalk in appearance, but very different\r\nfrom it in nature. From the softness of these materials it was worn\r\ninto many gulleys. There was not a tree, and, excepting the guanaco,\r\nwhich stood on the hilltop a watchful sentinel over its herd, scarcely\r\nan animal or a bird. All was stillness and desolation. Yet in passing\r\nover these scenes, without one bright object near, an ill-defined but\r\nstrong sense of pleasure is vividly excited. One asked how many ages\r\nthe plain had thus lasted, and how many more it was doomed thus to\r\ncontinue.\r\n\r\nNone can reply—all seems eternal now.\r\nThe wilderness has a mysterious tongue,\r\nWhich teaches awful doubt.[11]\r\n\r\n\r\n [11] Shelley, _Lines on M. Blanc._\r\n\r\nIn the evening we sailed a few miles farther up, and then pitched the\r\ntents for the night. By the middle of the next day the yawl was\r\naground, and from the shoalness of the water could not proceed any\r\nhigher. The water being found partly fresh, Mr. Chaffers took the\r\ndingey and went up two or three miles farther, where she also grounded,\r\nbut in a fresh-water river. The water was muddy, and though the stream\r\nwas most insignificant in size, it would be difficult to account for\r\nits origin, except from the melting snow on the Cordillera. At the spot\r\nwhere we bivouacked, we were surrounded by bold cliffs and steep\r\npinnacles of porphyry. I do not think I ever saw a spot which appeared\r\nmore secluded from the rest of the world than this rocky crevice in the\r\nwide plain.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second day after our return to the anchorage, a party of officers\r\nand myself went to ransack an old Indian grave, which I had found on\r\nthe summit of a neighbouring hill. Two immense stones, each probably\r\nweighing at least a couple of tons, had been placed in front of a ledge\r\nof rock about six feet high. At the bottom of the grave on the hard\r\nrock there was a layer of earth about a foot deep, which must have been\r\nbrought up from the plain below. Above it a pavement of flat stones was\r\nplaced, on which others were piled, so as to fill up the space between\r\nthe ledge and the two great blocks. To complete the grave, the Indians\r\nhad contrived to detach from the ledge a huge fragment, and to throw it\r\nover the pile so as to rest on the two blocks. We undermined the grave\r\non both sides, but could not find any relics, or even bones. The latter\r\nprobably had decayed long since (in which case the grave must have been\r\nof extreme antiquity), for I found in another place some smaller heaps,\r\nbeneath which a very few crumbling fragments could yet be distinguished\r\nas having belonged to a man. Falconer states, that where an Indian dies\r\nhe is buried, but that subsequently his bones are carefully taken up\r\nand carried, let the distance be ever so great, to be deposited near\r\nthe sea-coast. This custom, I think, may be accounted for by\r\nrecollecting that, before the introduction of horses, these Indians\r\nmust have led nearly the same life as the Fuegians now do, and\r\ntherefore generally have resided in the neighbourhood of the sea. The\r\ncommon prejudice of lying where one’s ancestors have lain, would make\r\nthe now roaming Indians bring the less perishable part of their dead to\r\ntheir ancient burial-ground on the coast.\r\n\r\n_January_ 9_th._—Before it was dark the _Beagle_ anchored in the fine\r\nspacious harbour of Port St. Julian, situated about one hundred and ten\r\nmiles to the south of Port Desire. We remained here eight days. The\r\ncountry is nearly similar to that of Port Desire, but perhaps rather\r\nmore sterile. One day a party accompanied Captain Fitz Roy on a long\r\nwalk round the head of the harbour. We were eleven hours without\r\ntasting any water, and some of the party were quite exhausted. From the\r\nsummit of a hill (since well named Thirsty Hill) a fine lake was spied,\r\nand two of the party proceeded with concerted signals to show whether\r\nit was fresh water. What was our disappointment to find a snow-white\r\nexpanse of salt, crystallised in great\r\ncubes! We attributed our extreme thirst to the dryness of the\r\natmosphere; but whatever the cause might be, we were exceedingly glad\r\nlate in the evening to get back to the boats. Although we could nowhere\r\nfind, during our whole visit, a single drop of fresh water, yet some\r\nmust exist; for by an odd chance I found on the surface of the salt\r\nwater, near the head of the bay, a Colymbetes not quite dead, which\r\nmust have lived in some not far distant pool. Three other insects (a\r\nCincindela, like _hybrida_, a Cymindis, and a Harpalus, which all live\r\non muddy flats occasionally overflowed by the sea), and one other found\r\ndead on the plain, complete the list of the beetles. A good-sized fly\r\n(Tabanus) was extremely numerous, and tormented us by its painful bite.\r\nThe common horsefly, which is so troublesome in the shady lanes of\r\nEngland, belongs to this same genus. We here have the puzzle that so\r\nfrequently occurs in the case of musquitoes—on the blood of what\r\nanimals do these insects commonly feed? The guanaco is nearly the only\r\nwarm-blooded quadruped, and it is found in quite inconsiderable numbers\r\ncompared with the multitude of flies.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe geology of Patagonia is interesting. Differently from Europe, where\r\nthe tertiary formations appear to have accumulated in bays, here along\r\nhundreds of miles of coast we have one great deposit, including many\r\ntertiary shells, all apparently extinct. The most common shell is a\r\nmassive gigantic oyster, sometimes even a foot in diameter. These beds\r\nare covered by others of a peculiar soft white stone, including much\r\ngypsum, and resembling chalk, but really of a pumiceous nature. It is\r\nhighly remarkable, from being composed, to at least one-tenth part of\r\nits bulk, of Infusoria: Professor Ehrenberg has already ascertained in\r\nit thirty oceanic forms. This bed extends for 500 miles along the\r\ncoast, and probably for a considerably greater distance. At Port St.\r\nJulian its thickness is more than 800 feet! These white beds are\r\neverywhere capped by a mass of gravel, forming probably one of the\r\nlargest beds of shingle in the world: it certainly extends from near\r\nthe Rio Colorado to between 600 and 700 nautical miles southward, at\r\nSanta Cruz (a river a little south of St. Julian) it reaches to the\r\nfoot of the Cordillera; half way up the river its thickness is more\r\nthan 200 feet; it probably everywhere extends to this great chain,\r\nwhence the well-rounded pebbles of porphyry have been derived: we may\r\nconsider its average breadth as 200 miles, and its average thickness as\r\nabout 50 feet. If this great bed of pebbles, without including the mud\r\nnecessarily derived from their attrition, was piled into a mound, it\r\nwould form a great mountain chain! When we consider that all these\r\npebbles, countless as the grains of sand in the desert, have been\r\nderived from the slow falling of masses of rock on the old coast-lines\r\nand banks of rivers, and that these fragments have been dashed into\r\nsmaller pieces, and that each of them has since been slowly rolled,\r\nrounded, and far transported, the mind is stupefied in thinking over\r\nthe long, absolutely necessary, lapse of years. Yet all this gravel has\r\nbeen transported, and probably rounded, subsequently to the deposition\r\nof the white beds, and long subsequently to the underlying beds with\r\nthe tertiary shells.\r\n\r\nEverything in this southern continent has been effected on a grand\r\nscale: the land, from the Rio Plata to Tierra del Fuego, a distance of\r\n1200 miles, has been raised in mass (and in Patagonia to a height of\r\nbetween 300 and 400 feet), within the period of the now existing\r\nsea-shells. The old and weathered shells left on the surface of the\r\nupraised plain still partially retain their colours. The uprising\r\nmovement has been interrupted by at least eight long periods of rest,\r\nduring which the sea ate deeply back into the land, forming at\r\nsuccessive levels the long lines of cliffs or escarpments, which\r\nseparate the different plains as they rise like steps one behind the\r\nother. The elevatory movement, and the eating-back power of the sea\r\nduring the periods of rest, have been equable over long lines of coast;\r\nfor I was astonished to find that the step-like plains stand at nearly\r\ncorresponding heights at far distant points. The lowest plain is 90\r\nfeet high; and the highest, which I ascended near the coast, is 950\r\nfeet; and of this only relics are left in the form of flat\r\ngravel-capped hills. The upper plain of Santa Cruz slopes up to a\r\nheight of 3000 feet at the foot of the Cordillera. I have said that\r\nwithin the period of existing sea-shells, Patagonia has been upraised\r\n300 to 400 feet: I may add, that within the period when icebergs\r\ntransported boulders over the upper plain of Santa Cruz, the elevation\r\nhas been at least 1500 feet. Nor has Patagonia been\r\naffected only by upward movements: the extinct tertiary shells from\r\nPort St. Julian and Santa Cruz cannot have lived, according to\r\nProfessor E. Forbes, in a greater depth of water than from 40 to 250\r\nfeet; but they are now covered with sea-deposited strata from 800 to\r\n1000 feet in thickness: hence the bed of the sea, on which these shells\r\nonce lived, must have sunk downwards several hundred feet, to allow of\r\nthe accumulation of the superincumbent strata. What a history of\r\ngeological changes does the simply-constructed coast of Patagonia\r\nreveal!\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAt Port St. Julian,[12] in some red mud capping the gravel on the\r\n90-feet plain, I found half the skeleton of the Macrauchenia\r\nPatachonica, a remarkable quadruped, full as large as a camel. It\r\nbelongs to the same division of the Pachydermata with the rhinoceros,\r\ntapir, and palæotherium; but in the structure of the bones of its long\r\nneck it shows a clear relation to the camel, or rather to the guanaco\r\nand llama. From recent sea-shells being found on two of the higher\r\nstep-formed plains, which must have been modelled and upraised before\r\nthe mud was deposited in which the Macrauchenia was intombed, it is\r\ncertain that this curious quadruped lived long after the sea was\r\ninhabited by its present shells. I was at first much surprised how a\r\nlarge quadruped could so lately have subsisted, in lat. 49° 15′, on\r\nthese wretched gravel plains with their stunted vegetation; but the\r\nrelationship of the Macrauchenia to the Guanaco, now an inhabitant of\r\nthe most sterile parts, partly explains this difficulty.\r\n\r\n [12] I have lately heard that Captain Sulivan, R.N., has found\r\n numerous fossil bones, embedded in regular strata, on the banks of the\r\n R. Gallegos, in lat. 51° 4′. Some of the bones are large; others are\r\n small, and appear to have belonged to an armadillo. This is a most\r\n interesting and important discovery.\r\n\r\nThe relationship, though distant, between the Macrauchenia and the\r\nGuanaco, between the Toxodon and the Capybara,—the closer relationship\r\nbetween the many extinct Edentata and the living sloths, ant-eaters,\r\nand armadillos, now so eminently characteristic of South American\r\nzoology,—and the still closer relationship between the fossil and\r\nliving species of Ctenomys and Hydrochærus, are most interesting facts.\r\nThis relationship is shown wonderfully—as wonderfully as between the\r\nfossil and extinct Marsupial animals of Australia—by the\r\ngreat collection lately brought to Europe from the caves of Brazil by\r\nMM. Lund and Clausen. In this collection there are extinct species of\r\nall the thirty-two genera, excepting four, of the terrestrial\r\nquadrupeds now inhabiting the provinces in which the caves occur; and\r\nthe extinct species are much more numerous than those now living: there\r\nare fossil ant-eaters, armadillos, tapirs, peccaries, guanacos,\r\nopossums, and numerous South American gnawers and monkeys, and other\r\nanimals. This wonderful relationship in the same continent between the\r\ndead and the living, will, I do not doubt, hereafter throw more light\r\non the appearance of organic beings on our earth, and their\r\ndisappearance from it, than any other class of facts.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to reflect on the changed state of the American\r\ncontinent without the deepest astonishment. Formerly it must have\r\nswarmed with great monsters: now we find mere pigmies, compared with\r\nthe antecedent allied races. If Buffon had known of the gigantic sloth\r\nand armadillo-like animals, and of the lost Pachydermata, he might have\r\nsaid with a greater semblance of truth that the creative force in\r\nAmerica had lost its power, rather than that it had never possessed\r\ngreat vigour. The greater number, if not all, of these extinct\r\nquadrupeds lived at a late period, and were the contemporaries of most\r\nof the existing sea-shells. Since they lived, no very great change in\r\nthe form of the land can have taken place. What, then, has exterminated\r\nso many species and whole genera? The mind at first is irresistibly\r\nhurried into the belief of some great catastrophe; but thus to destroy\r\nanimals, both large and small, in Southern Patagonia, in Brazil, on the\r\nCordillera of Peru, in North America up to Behring’s Straits, we must\r\nshake the entire framework of the globe. An examination, moreover, of\r\nthe geology of La Plata and Patagonia, leads to the belief that all the\r\nfeatures of the land result from slow and gradual changes. It appears\r\nfrom the character of the fossils in Europe, Asia, Australia, and in\r\nNorth and South America, that those conditions which favour the life of\r\nthe _larger_ quadrupeds were lately coextensive with the world: what\r\nthose conditions were, no one has yet even conjectured. It could hardly\r\nhave been a change of temperature, which at about the same time\r\ndestroyed the inhabitants of tropical, temperate, and arctic latitudes\r\non both sides of the globe. In North America we positively know from\r\nMr. Lyell that the large quadrupeds lived subsequently to that period,\r\nwhen boulders were brought into latitudes at which icebergs now never\r\narrive: from conclusive but indirect reasons we may feel sure, that in\r\nthe southern hemisphere the Macrauchenia, also, lived long subsequently\r\nto the ice-transporting boulder-period. Did man, after his first inroad\r\ninto South America, destroy, as has been suggested, the unwieldy\r\nMegatherium and the other Edentata? We must at least look to some other\r\ncause for the destruction of the little tucutuco at Bahia Blanca, and\r\nof the many fossil mice and other small quadrupeds in Brazil. No one\r\nwill imagine that a drought, even far severer than those which cause\r\nsuch losses in the provinces of La Plata, could destroy every\r\nindividual of every species from Southern Patagonia to Behring’s\r\nStraits. What shall we say of the extinction of the horse? Did those\r\nplains fail of pasture, which have since been overrun by thousands and\r\nhundreds of thousands of the descendants of the stock introduced by the\r\nSpaniards? Have the subsequently introduced species consumed the food\r\nof the great antecedent races? Can we believe that the Capybara has\r\ntaken the food of the Toxodon, the Guanaco of the Macrauchenia, the\r\nexisting small Edentata of their numerous gigantic prototypes?\r\nCertainly, no fact in the long history of the world is so startling as\r\nthe wide and repeated exterminations of its inhabitants.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, if we consider the subject under another point of view,\r\nit will appear less perplexing. We do not steadily bear in mind how\r\nprofoundly ignorant we are of the conditions of existence of every\r\nanimal; nor do we always remember that some check is constantly\r\npreventing the too rapid increase of every organised being left in a\r\nstate of nature. The supply of food, on an average, remains constant,\r\nyet the tendency in every animal to increase by propagation is\r\ngeometrical; and its surprising effects have nowhere been more\r\nastonishingly shown, than in the case of the European animals run wild\r\nduring the last few centuries in America. Every animal in a state of\r\nnature regularly breeds; yet in a species long established, any _great_\r\nincrease in numbers is obviously impossible, and must be checked by\r\nsome means. We are, nevertheless, seldom able with certainty to tell in\r\nany given\r\nspecies, at what period of life, or at what period of the year, or\r\nwhether only at long intervals, the check falls; or, again, what is the\r\nprecise nature of the check. Hence probably it is that we feel so\r\nlittle surprise at one, of two species closely allied in habits, being\r\nrare and the other abundant in the same district; or, again, that one\r\nshould be abundant in one district, and another, filling the same place\r\nin the economy of nature, should be abundant in a neighbouring\r\ndistrict, differing very little in its conditions. If asked how this\r\nis, one immediately replies that it is determined by some slight\r\ndifference in climate, food, or the number of enemies: yet how rarely,\r\nif ever, we can point out the precise cause and manner of action of the\r\ncheck! We are therefore, driven to the conclusion that causes generally\r\nquite inappreciable by us, determine whether a given species shall be\r\nabundant or scanty in numbers.\r\n\r\nIn the cases where we can trace the extinction of a species through\r\nman, either wholly or in one limited district, we know that it becomes\r\nrarer and rarer, and is then lost: it would be difficult to point out\r\nany just distinction[13] between a species destroyed by man or by the\r\nincrease of its natural enemies. The evidence of rarity preceding\r\nextinction is more striking in the successive tertiary strata, as\r\nremarked by several able observers; it has often been found that a\r\nshell very common in a tertiary stratum is now most rare, and has even\r\nlong been thought to be extinct. If then, as appears probable, species\r\nfirst become rare and then extinct—if the too rapid increase of every\r\nspecies, even the most favoured, is steadily checked, as we must admit,\r\nthough how and when it is hard to say—and if we see, without the\r\nsmallest surprise, though unable to assign the precise reason, one\r\nspecies abundant and another closely-allied species rare in the same\r\ndistrict—why should we feel such great astonishment at the rarity being\r\ncarried a step farther to extinction? An action going on, on every side\r\nof us, and yet barely appreciable, might surely be carried a little\r\nfarther without exciting our observation. Who would feel any great\r\nsurprise at hearing that the Magalonyx was formerly rare compared with\r\nthe Megatherium, or that one of the fossil monkeys was few in number\r\ncompared with one of the now\r\nliving monkeys? and yet in this comparative rarity, we should have the\r\nplainest evidence of less favourable conditions for their existence. To\r\nadmit that species generally become rare before they become extinct—to\r\nfeel no surprise at the comparative rarity of one species with another,\r\nand yet to call in some extraordinary agent and to marvel greatly when\r\na species ceases to exist, appears to me much the same as to admit that\r\nsickness in the individual is the prelude to death—to feel no surprise\r\nat sickness—but when the sick man dies to wonder, and to believe that\r\nhe died through violence.\r\n\r\n [13] See the excellent remarks on this subject by Mr. Lyell, in his\r\n _Principles of Geology._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IX\r\n\r\n\r\nSanta Cruz—Expedition up the River—Indians—Immense Streams of basaltic\r\nlava—Fragments not transported by the River—Excavation of the\r\nvalley—Condor, habits of—Cordillera—Erratic boulders of great\r\nsize—Indian relics—Return to the ship—Falkland Islands—Wild horses,\r\ncattle, rabbits—Wolf-like fox—Fire made of bones—Manner of hunting wild\r\ncattle—Geology—Streams of stones—Scenes of violence—Penguin—Geese—Eggs\r\nof Doris—Compound animals.\r\n\r\nSANTA CRUZ, PATAGONIA, AND THE FALKLAND ISLANDS.\r\n\r\n_April_ 13_th_, 1834.—The _Beagle_ anchored within the mouth of the\r\nSanta Cruz. This river is situated about sixty miles south of Port St.\r\nJulian. During the last voyage Captain Stokes proceeded thirty miles up\r\nit, but then, from the want of provisions,\r\nwas obliged to return. Excepting what was discovered at that time,\r\nscarcely anything was known about this large river. Captain Fitz Roy\r\nnow determined to follow its course as far as time would allow. On the\r\n18th three whale-boats started, carrying three weeks’ provisions; and\r\nthe party consisted of twenty-five souls—a force which would have been\r\nsufficient to have defied a host of Indians. With a strong flood-tide\r\nand a fine day we made a good run, soon drank some of the fresh water,\r\nand were at night nearly above the tidal influence.\r\n\r\nThe river here assumed a size and appearance which, even at the highest\r\npoint we ultimately reached, was scarcely diminished. It was generally\r\nfrom three to four hundred yards broad, and in the middle about\r\nseventeen feet deep. The rapidity of the current, which in its whole\r\ncourse runs at the rate of from four to six knots an hour, is perhaps\r\nits most remarkable feature. The water is of a fine blue colour, but\r\nwith a slight milky tinge, and not so transparent as at first sight\r\nwould have been expected. It flows over a bed of pebbles, like those\r\nwhich compose the beach and the surrounding plains. It runs in a\r\nwinding course through a valley, which extends in a direct line\r\nwestward. This valley varies from five to ten miles in breadth; it is\r\nbounded by step-formed terraces, which rise in most parts, one above\r\nthe other, to the height of five hundred feet, and have on the opposite\r\nsides a remarkable correspondence.\r\n\r\n_April_ 19_th._—Against so strong a current it was, of course, quite\r\nimpossible to row or sail: consequently the three boats were fastened\r\ntogether head and stern, two hands left in each, and the rest came on\r\nshore to track. As the general arrangements made by Captain Fitz Roy\r\nwere very good for facilitating the work of all, and as all had a share\r\nin it, I will describe the system. The party, including every one, was\r\ndivided into two spells, each of which hauled at the tracking line\r\nalternately for an hour and a half. The officers of each boat lived\r\nwith, ate the same food, and slept in the same tent with their crew, so\r\nthat each boat was quite independent of the others. After sunset the\r\nfirst level spot where any bushes were growing was chosen for our\r\nnight’s lodging. Each of the crew took it in turns to be cook.\r\nImmediately the boat was hauled up, the cook made his fire; two others\r\npitched the tent; the coxswain handed the things out of the boat; the\r\nrest carried them up to the tents\r\nand collected firewood. By this order, in half an hour everything was\r\nready for the night. A watch of two men and an officer was always kept,\r\nwhose duty it was to look after the boats, keep up the fire, and guard\r\nagainst Indians. Each in the party had his one hour every night.\r\n\r\nDuring this day we tracked but a short distance, for there were many\r\nislets, covered by thorny bushes, and the channels between them were\r\nshallow.\r\n\r\n_April_ 20_th._—We passed the islands and set to work. Our regular\r\nday’s march, although it was hard enough, carried us on an average only\r\nten miles in a straight line, and perhaps fifteen or twenty altogether.\r\nBeyond the place where we slept last night, the country is completely\r\n_terra incognita_, for it was there that Captain Stokes turned back. We\r\nsaw in the distance a great smoke, and found the skeleton of a horse,\r\nso we knew that Indians were in the neighbourhood. On the next morning\r\n(21st) tracks of a party of horse, and marks left by the trailing of\r\nthe chuzos, or long spears, were observed on the ground. It was\r\ngenerally thought that the Indians had reconnoitred us during the\r\nnight. Shortly afterwards we came to a spot where, from the fresh\r\nfootsteps of men, children, and horses, it was evident that the party\r\nhad crossed the river.\r\n\r\n_April_ 22_nd._—The country remained the same, and was extremely\r\nuninteresting. The complete similarity of the productions throughout\r\nPatagonia is one of its most striking characters. The level plains of\r\narid shingle support the same stunted and dwarf plants; and in the\r\nvalleys the same thorn-bearing bushes grow. Everywhere we see the same\r\nbirds and insects. Even the very banks of the river and of the clear\r\nstreamlets which entered it, were scarcely enlivened by a brighter tint\r\nof green. The curse of sterility is on the land, and the water flowing\r\nover a bed of pebbles partakes of the same curse. Hence the number of\r\nwaterfowl is very scanty; for there is nothing to support life in the\r\nstream of this barren river.\r\n\r\nPatagonia, poor as she is in some respects, can however boast of a\r\ngreater stock of small rodents[1] than perhaps any other country in the\r\nworld. Several species of mice are externally\r\ncharacterised by large thin ears and a very fine fur. These little\r\nanimals swarm amongst the thickets in the valleys, where they cannot\r\nfor months together taste a drop of water excepting the dew. They all\r\nseem to be cannibals; for no sooner was a mouse caught in one of my\r\ntraps than it was devoured by others. A small and delicately-shaped\r\nfox, which is likewise very abundant, probably derives its entire\r\nsupport from these small animals. The guanaco is also in his proper\r\ndistrict, herds of fifty or a hundred were common; and, as I have\r\nstated, we saw one which must have contained at least five hundred. The\r\npuma, with the condor and other carrion-hawks in its train, follows and\r\npreys upon these animals. The footsteps of the puma were to be seen\r\nalmost everywhere on the banks of the river; and the remains of several\r\nguanacos, with their necks dislocated and bones broken, showed how they\r\nhad met their death.\r\n\r\n [1] The desserts of Syria are characterised, according to Volney (tome\r\n i, p. 351), by woody bushes, numerous rats, gazelles and hares. In the\r\n landscape of Patagonia the guanaco replaces the gazelle, and the\r\n agouti the hare.\r\n\r\n_April_ 24_th._—Like the navigators of old when approaching an unknown\r\nland, we examined and watched for the most trivial sign of a change.\r\nThe drifted trunk of a tree, or a boulder of primitive rock, was hailed\r\nwith joy, as if we had seen a forest growing on the flanks of the\r\nCordillera. The top, however, of a heavy bank of clouds, which remained\r\nalmost constantly in one position, was the most promising sign, and\r\neventually turned out a true harbinger. At first the clouds were\r\nmistaken for the mountains themselves, instead of the masses of vapour\r\ncondensed by their icy summits.\r\n\r\n_April_ 26_th._—We this day met with a marked change in the geological\r\nstructure of the plains. From the first starting I had carefully\r\nexamined the gravel in the river, and for the two last days had noticed\r\nthe presence of a few small pebbles of a very cellular basalt. These\r\ngradually increased in number and in size, but none were as large as a\r\nman’s head. This morning, however, pebbles of the same rock, but more\r\ncompact, suddenly became abundant, and in the course of half an hour we\r\nsaw, at the distance of five or six miles, the angular edge of a great\r\nbasaltic platform. When we arrived at its base we found the stream\r\nbubbling among the fallen blocks. For the next twenty-eight miles the\r\nriver-course was encumbered with these basaltic masses. Above that\r\nlimit immense fragments of primitive rocks, derived from the\r\nsurrounding boulder-formation, were equally numerous. None of the\r\nfragments of any considerable size had been washed\r\nmore than three or four miles down the river below their parent-source:\r\nconsidering the singular rapidity of the great body of water in the\r\nSanta Cruz, and that no still reaches occur in any part, this example\r\nis a most striking one, of the inefficiency of rivers in transporting\r\neven moderately-sized fragments.\r\n\r\nThe basalt is only lava which has flowed beneath the sea; but the\r\neruptions must have been on the grandest scale. At the point where we\r\nfirst met this formation it was 120 feet in thickness; following up the\r\nriver-course, the surface imperceptibly rose and the mass became\r\nthicker, so that at forty miles above the first station it was 320 feet\r\nthick. What the thickness may be close to the Cordillera, I have no\r\nmeans of knowing, but the platform there attains a height of about\r\nthree thousand feet above the level of the sea: we must therefore look\r\nto the mountains of that great chain for its source; and worthy of such\r\na source are streams that have flowed over the gently inclined bed of\r\nthe sea to a distance of one hundred miles. At the first glance of the\r\nbasaltic cliffs on the opposite sides of the valley it was evident that\r\nthe strata once were united. What power, then, has removed along a\r\nwhole line of country a solid mass of very hard rock, which had an\r\naverage thickness of nearly three hundred feet, and a breadth varying\r\nfrom rather less than two miles to four miles? The river, though it has\r\nso little power in transporting even inconsiderable fragments, yet in\r\nthe lapse of ages might produce by its gradual erosion an effect, of\r\nwhich it is difficult to judge the amount. But in this case,\r\nindependently of the insignificance of such an agency, good reasons can\r\nbe assigned for believing that this valley was formerly occupied by an\r\narm of the sea. It is needless in this work to detail the arguments\r\nleading to this conclusion, derived from the form and the nature of the\r\nstep-formed terraces on both sides of the valley, from the manner in\r\nwhich the bottom of the valley near the Andes expands into a great\r\nestuary-like plain with sand-hillocks on it, and from the occurrence of\r\na few sea-shells lying in the bed of the river. If I had space I could\r\nprove that South America was formerly here cut off by a strait, joining\r\nthe Atlantic and Pacific oceans, like that of Magellan. But it may yet\r\nbe asked, how has the solid basalt been removed? Geologists formerly\r\nwould have brought into play the violent action of some overwhelming\r\ndebacle; but in this case such a\r\nsupposition would have been quite inadmissible; because, the same\r\nstep-like plains with existing sea-shells lying on their surface, which\r\nfront the long line of the Patagonian coast, sweep up on each side of\r\nthe valley of Santa Cruz. No possible action of any flood could thus\r\nhave modelled the land, either within the valley or along the open\r\ncoast; and by the formation of such step-like plains or terraces the\r\nvalley itself has been hollowed out. Although we know that there are\r\ntides which run within the Narrows of the Strait of Magellan at the\r\nrate of eight knots an hour, yet we must confess that it makes the head\r\nalmost giddy to reflect on the number of years, century after century,\r\nwhich the tides, unaided by a heavy surf, must have required to have\r\ncorroded so vast an area and thickness of solid basaltic lava.\r\nNevertheless, we must believe that the strata undermined by the waters\r\nof this ancient strait were broken up into huge fragments, and these\r\nlying scattered on the beach were reduced first to smaller blocks, then\r\nto pebbles, and lastly to the most impalpable mud, which the tides\r\ndrifted far into the Eastern or Western Ocean.\r\n\r\nWith the change in the geological structure of the plains the character\r\nof the landscape likewise altered. While rambling up some of the narrow\r\nand rocky defiles, I could almost have fancied myself transported back\r\nagain to the barren valleys of the island of St. Jago. Among the\r\nbasaltic cliffs I found some plants which I had seen nowhere else, but\r\nothers I recognised as being wanderers from Tierra del Fuego. These\r\nporous rocks serve as a reservoir for the scanty rain-water; and\r\nconsequently on the line where the igneous and sedimentary formations\r\nunite, some small springs (most rare occurrences in Patagonia) burst\r\nforth; and they could be distinguished at a distance by the\r\ncircumscribed patches of bright green herbage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n_April_ 27_th._—The bed of the river became rather narrower, and hence\r\nthe stream more rapid. It here ran at the rate of six knots an hour.\r\nFrom this cause, and from the many great angular fragments, tracking\r\nthe boats became both dangerous and laborious.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis day I shot a condor. It measured from tip to tip of the wings\r\neight and a half feet, and from beak to tail four\r\nfeet. This bird is known to have a wide geographical range, being found\r\non the west coast of South America, from the Strait of Magellan along\r\nthe Cordillera as far as eight degrees north of the equator. The steep\r\ncliff near the mouth of the Rio Negro is its northern limit on the\r\nPatagonian coast; and they have there wandered about four hundred miles\r\nfrom the great central line of their habitation in the Andes. Further\r\nsouth, among the bold precipices at the head of Port Desire, the condor\r\nis not uncommon; yet only a few stragglers occasionally visit the\r\nsea-coast. A line of cliff near the mouth of the Santa Cruz is\r\nfrequented by these birds, and about eighty miles up the river, where\r\nthe sides of the valley are formed by steep basaltic precipices, the\r\ncondor reappears. From these facts, it seems that the condors require\r\nperpendicular cliffs. In Chile, they haunt, during the greater part of\r\nthe year, the lower country near the shores of the Pacific, and at\r\nnight several roost together in one tree; but in the early part of\r\nsummer they retire to the most inaccessible parts of the inner\r\nCordillera, there to breed in peace.\r\n\r\nWith respect to their propagation, I was told by the country people in\r\nChile that the condor makes no sort of nest, but in the months of\r\nNovember and December lays two large white eggs on a shelf of bare\r\nrock. It is said that the young condors cannot fly for an entire year;\r\nand long after they are able, they continue to roost by night, an hunt\r\nby day with their parents. The old birds generally live in pairs; but\r\namong the inland basaltic cliffs of the Santa Cruz I found a spot where\r\nscores must usually haunt. On coming suddenly to the brow of the\r\nprecipice, it was a grand spectacle to see between twenty and thirty of\r\nthese great birds start heavily from their resting-place, and wheel\r\naway in majestic circles. From the quantity of dung on the rocks, they\r\nmust long have frequented this cliff for roosting and breeding. Having\r\ngorged themselves with carrion on the plains below, they retire to\r\nthese favourite ledges to digest their food. From these facts, the\r\ncondor, like the gallinazo must to a certain degree be considered as a\r\ngregarious bird. In this part of the country they live altogether on\r\nthe guanacos which have died a natural death, or as more commonly\r\nhappens, have been killed by the pumas. I believe, from what I saw in\r\nPatagonia, that they do not on ordinary occasions\r\nextend their daily excursions to any great distance from their regular\r\nsleeping-places.\r\n\r\nThe condors may oftentimes be seen at a great height, soaring over a\r\ncertain spot in the most graceful circles. On some occasions I am sure\r\nthat they do this only for pleasure, but on others, the Chileno\r\ncountryman tells you that they are watching a dying animal, or the puma\r\ndevouring its prey. If the condors glide down, and then suddenly all\r\nrise together, the Chileno knows that it is the puma which, watching\r\nthe carcass, has sprung out to drive away the robbers. Besides feeding\r\non carrion, the condors frequently attack young goats and lambs; and\r\nthe shepherd-dogs are trained, whenever they pass over, to run out, and\r\nlooking upwards to bark violently. The Chilenos destroy and catch\r\nnumbers. Two methods are used; one is to place a carcass on a level\r\npiece of ground within an enclosure of sticks with an opening, and when\r\nthe condors are gorged, to gallop up on horseback to the entrance, and\r\nthus enclose them: for when this bird has not space to run, it cannot\r\ngive its body sufficient momentum to rise from the ground. The second\r\nmethod is to mark the trees in which, frequently to the number of five\r\nor six together, they roost, and then at night to climb up and noose\r\nthem. They are such heavy sleepers, as I have myself witnessed, that\r\nthis is not a difficult task. At Valparaiso I have seen a living condor\r\nsold for sixpence, but the common price is eight or ten shillings. One\r\nwhich I saw brought in, had been tied with rope, and was much injured;\r\nyet, the moment the line was cut by which its bill was secured,\r\nalthough surrounded by people, it began ravenously to tear a piece of\r\ncarrion. In a garden at the same place, between twenty and thirty were\r\nkept alive. They were fed only once a week, but they appeared in pretty\r\ngood health.[2] The Chileno countrymen assert that the condor will\r\nlive, and retain its vigour, between five and six weeks without eating:\r\nI cannot answer for the truth of this, but it is a cruel experiment,\r\nwhich very likely has been tried.\r\n\r\n [2] I noticed that several hours before any one of the condors died,\r\n all the lice, with which it was infested, crawled to the outside\r\n feathers. I was assured that this always happens.\r\n\r\nWhen an animal is killed in the country, it is well known that the\r\ncondors, like other carrion-vultures, soon gain intelligence\r\nof it, and congregate in an inexplicable manner. In most cases it must\r\nnot be overlooked, that the birds have discovered their prey, and have\r\npicked the skeleton clean, before the flesh is in the least degree\r\ntainted. Remembering the experiments of M. Audubon, on the little\r\nsmelling powers of carrion-hawks, I tried in the above-mentioned garden\r\nthe following experiment: the condors were tied, each by a rope, in a\r\nlong row at the bottom of a wall; and having folded up a piece of meat\r\nin white paper, I walked backwards and forwards, carrying it in my hand\r\nat the distance of about three yards from them, but no notice whatever\r\nwas taken. I then threw it on the ground, within one yard of an old\r\nmale bird; he looked at it for a moment with attention, but then\r\nregarded it no more. With a stick I pushed it closer and closer, until\r\nat last he touched it with his beak; the paper was then instantly torn\r\noff with fury, and at the same moment, every bird in the long row began\r\nstruggling and flapping its wings. Under the same circumstances it\r\nwould have been quite impossible to have deceived a dog. The evidence\r\nin favour of and against the acute smelling powers of carrion-vultures\r\nis singularly balanced. Professor Owen has demonstrated that the\r\nolfactory nerves of the turkey-buzzard (Cathartes aura) are highly\r\ndeveloped, and on the evening when Mr. Owen’s paper was read at the\r\nZoological Society, it was mentioned by a gentleman that he had seen\r\nthe carrion-hawks in the West Indies on two occasions collect on the\r\nroof of a house, when a corpse had become offensive from not having\r\nbeen buried: in this case, the intelligence could hardly have been\r\nacquired by sight. On the other hand, besides the experiments of\r\nAudubon and that one by myself, Mr. Bachman has tried in the United\r\nStates many varied plans, showing that neither the turkey-buzzard (the\r\nspecies dissected by Professor Owen) nor the gallinazo find their food\r\nby smell. He covered portions of highly-offensive offal with a thin\r\ncanvas cloth, and strewed pieces of meat on it: these the\r\ncarrion-vultures ate up, and then remained quietly standing, with their\r\nbeaks within the eighth of an inch of the putrid mass, without\r\ndiscovering it. A small rent was made in the canvas, and the offal was\r\nimmediately discovered; the canvas was replaced by a fresh piece, and\r\nmeat again put on it, and was again devoured by the vultures without\r\ntheir discovering the\r\nhidden mass on which they were trampling. These facts are attested by\r\nthe signatures of six gentlemen, besides that of Mr. Bachman.[3]\r\n\r\n [3] Loudon’s _Magazine of Natural History_, vol. vii.\r\n\r\nOften when lying down to rest on the open plains, on looking upwards, I\r\nhave seen carrion-hawks sailing through the air at a great height.\r\nWhere the country is level I do not believe a space of the heavens, of\r\nmore than fifteen degrees above the horizon, is commonly viewed with\r\nany attention by a person either walking or on horseback. If such be\r\nthe case, and the vulture is on the wing at a height of between three\r\nand four thousand feet, before it could come within the range of\r\nvision, its distance in a straight line from the beholder’s eye would\r\nbe rather more than two British miles. Might it not thus readily be\r\noverlooked? When an animal is killed by the sportsman in a lonely\r\nvalley, may he not all the while be watched from above by the\r\nsharp-sighted bird? And will not the manner of its descent proclaim\r\nthroughout the district to the whole family of carrion-feeders, that\r\ntheir prey is at hand?\r\n\r\nWhen the condors are wheeling in a flock round and round any spot, their\r\nflight is beautiful. Except when rising from the ground, I do not\r\nrecollect ever having seen one of these birds flap its wings. Near\r\nLima, I watched several for nearly half an hour, without once taking\r\noff my eyes: they moved in large curves, sweeping in circles,\r\ndescending and ascending without giving a single flap. As they glided\r\nclose over my head, I intently watched from an oblique position the\r\noutlines of the separate and great terminal feathers of each wing; and\r\nthese separate feathers, if there had been the least vibratory\r\nmovement, would have appeared as if blended together; but they were\r\nseen distinct against the blue sky. The head and neck were moved\r\nfrequently, and apparently with force; and the extended wings seemed to\r\nform the fulcrum on which the movements of the neck, body and tail\r\nacted. If the bird wished to descend, the wings were for a moment\r\ncollapsed; and when again expanded with an altered inclination, the\r\nmomentum gained by the rapid descent seemed to urge the bird upwards\r\nwith the even and steady movement of a paper kite. In the case of any\r\nbird _soaring_, its motion must be\r\nsufficiently rapid, so that the action of the inclined surface of its\r\nbody on the atmosphere may counterbalance its gravity. The force to\r\nkeep up the momentum of a body moving in a horizontal plane in the air\r\n(in which there is so little friction) cannot be great, and this force\r\nis all that is wanted. The movement of the neck and body of the condor,\r\nwe must suppose is sufficient for this. However this may be, it is\r\ntruly wonderful and beautiful to see so great a bird, hour after hour,\r\nwithout any apparent exertion, wheeling and gliding over mountain and\r\nriver.\r\n\r\n\r\n_April_ 29_th._—From some high land we hailed with joy the white\r\nsummits of the Cordillera, as they were seen occasionally peeping\r\nthrough their dusky envelope of clouds. During the few succeeding days\r\nwe continued to get on slowly, for we found the river-course very\r\ntortuous, and strewed with immense fragments of various ancient slaty\r\nrocks, and of granite. The plain bordering the valley had here attained\r\nan elevation of about 1100 feet above the river, and its character was\r\nmuch altered. The well-rounded pebbles of porphyry were mingled with\r\nmany immense angular fragments of basalt and of primary rocks. The\r\nfirst of these erratic boulders which I noticed was sixty-seven miles\r\ndistant from the nearest mountain; another which I measured was five\r\nyards square, and projected five feet above the gravel. Its edges were\r\nso angular, and its size so great, that I at first mistook it for a\r\nrock _in situ_, and took out my compass to observe the direction of its\r\ncleavage. The plain here was not quite so level as that nearer the\r\ncoast, but yet it betrayed no signs of any great violence. Under these\r\ncircumstances it is, I believe, quite impossible to explain the\r\ntransportal of these gigantic masses of rock so many miles from their\r\nparent-source, on any theory except by that of floating icebergs.\r\n\r\nDuring the two last days we met with signs of horses, and with several\r\nsmall articles which had belonged to the Indians—such as parts of a\r\nmantle and a bunch of ostrich feathers—but they appeared to have been\r\nlying long on the ground. Between the place where the Indians had so\r\nlately crossed the river and this neighbourhood, though so many miles\r\napart, the country appears to be quite unfrequented. At first,\r\nconsidering\r\nthe abundance of the guanacos, I was surprised at this; but it is\r\nexplained by the stony nature of the plains, which would soon disable\r\nan unshod horse from taking part in the chase. Nevertheless, in two\r\nplaces in this very central region, I found small heaps of stones,\r\nwhich I do not think could have been accidentally thrown together. They\r\nwere placed on points projecting over the edge of the highest lava\r\ncliff, and they resembled, but on a small scale, those near Port\r\nDesire.\r\n\r\n\r\n_May_ 4_th._—Captain Fitz Roy determined to take the boats no higher.\r\nThe river had a winding course, and was very rapid; and the appearance\r\nof the country offered no temptation to proceed any farther. Everywhere\r\nwe met with the same productions, and the same dreary landscape. We\r\nwere now one hundred and forty miles distant from the Atlantic, and\r\nabout sixty from the nearest arm of the Pacific. The valley in this\r\nupper part expanded into a wide basin, bounded on the north and south\r\nby the basaltic platforms, and fronted by the long range of the\r\nsnow-clad Cordillera. But we viewed these grand mountains with regret,\r\nfor we were obliged to imagine their nature and productions, instead of\r\nstanding, as we had hoped, on their summits. Besides the useless loss\r\nof time which an attempt to ascend the river any higher would have cost\r\nus, we had already been for some days on half allowance of bread. This,\r\nalthough really enough for reasonable men, was, after a hard day’s\r\nmarch, rather scanty food: a light stomach and an easy digestion are\r\ngood things to talk about, but very unpleasant in practice.\r\n\r\n\r\n5_th._—Before sunrise we commenced our descent. We shot down the stream\r\nwith great rapidity, generally at the rate of ten knots an hour. In\r\nthis one day we effected what had cost us five and a half hard days’\r\nlabour in ascending. On the 8th we reached the _Beagle_ after our\r\ntwenty-one days’ expedition. Every one, excepting myself, had cause to\r\nbe dissatisfied; but to me the ascent afforded a most interesting\r\nsection of the great tertiary formation of Patagonia.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn _March_ 1_st_, 1833, and again on _March_ 16_th, 1834, the\r\n_Beagle_ anchored in Berkeley Sound, in East Falkland Island. This\r\narchipelago is situated in nearly the same latitude with the mouth of\r\nthe Strait of Magellan; it covers a space of one hundred and twenty by\r\nsixty geographical miles, and is a little more than half the size of\r\nIreland. After the possession of these miserable islands had been\r\ncontested by France, Spain, and England, they were left uninhabited.\r\nThe government of Buenos Ayres then sold them to a private individual,\r\nbut likewise used them, as old Spain had done before, for a penal\r\nsettlement. England claimed her right an seized them. The Englishman\r\nwho was left in charge of the flag was consequently murdered. A British\r\nofficer was next sent, unsupported by any power: and when we arrived,\r\nwe found him in charge of a population, of which rather more than half\r\nwere runaway rebels and murderers.\r\n\r\nThe theatre is worthy of the scenes acted on it. An undulating land,\r\nwith a desolate and wretched aspect, is everywhere covered by a peaty\r\nsoil and wiry grass, of one monotonous brown colour. Here and there a\r\npeak or ridge of grey quartz rock breaks through the smooth surface.\r\nEvery one has heard of the climate of these regions; it may be compared\r\nto that which is experienced at the height of between one and two\r\nthousand feet, on the mountains of North Wales; having however less\r\nsunshine and less frost, but more wind and rain.[4]\r\n\r\n [4] From accounts published since our voyage, and more especially from\r\n several interesting letters from Capt. Sulivan, R.N., employed on the\r\n survey, it appears that we took an exaggerated view of the badness of\r\n the climate on these islands. But when I reflect on the almost\r\n universal covering of peat, and on the fact of wheat seldom ripening\r\n here, I can hardly believe that the climate in summer is so fine and\r\n dry as it has lately been represented.\r\n\r\n\r\n16_th._—I will now describe a short excursion which I made round a part\r\nof this island. In the morning I started with six horses and two\r\nGauchos: the latter were capital men for the purpose, and well\r\naccustomed to living on their own resources. The weather was very\r\nboisterous and cold, with heavy hail-storms. We got on, however, pretty\r\nwell, but, except the geology, nothing could be less interesting than\r\nour day’s ride. The country is uniformly the same undulating moorland;\r\nthe surface being covered by light brown withered grass and a few very\r\nsmall shrubs, all springing out of an elastic peaty soil. In the\r\nvalleys\r\nhere and there might be seen a small flock of wild geese, and\r\neverywhere the ground was so soft that the snipe were able to feed.\r\nBesides these two birds there were few others. There is one main range\r\nof hills, nearly two thousand feet in height, and composed of quartz\r\nrock, the rugged and barren crests of which gave us some trouble to\r\ncross. On the south side we came to the best country for wild cattle;\r\nwe met, however, no great number, for they had been lately much\r\nharassed.\r\n\r\nIn the evening we came across a small herd. One of my companions, St.\r\nJago by name, soon separated a fat cow; he threw the bolas, and it\r\nstruck her legs, but failed in becoming entangled. Then dropping his\r\nhat to mark the spot where the balls were left, while at full gallop he\r\nuncoiled his lazo, and after a most severe chase again came up to the\r\ncow, and caught her round the horns. The other Gaucho had gone on ahead\r\nwith the spare horses, so that St. Jago had some difficulty in killing\r\nthe furious beast. He managed to get her on a level piece of ground, by\r\ntaking advantage of her as often as she rushed at him; and when she\r\nwould not move, my horse, from having been trained, would canter up,\r\nand with his chest give her a violent push. But when on level ground it\r\ndoes not appear an easy job for one man to kill a beast mad with\r\nterror. Nor would it be so if the horse, when left to itself without\r\nits rider, did not soon learn, for its own safety, to keep the lazo\r\ntight; so that, if the cow or ox moves forward, the horse moves just as\r\nquickly forward; otherwise, it stands motionless leaning on one side.\r\nThis horse, however, was a young one, and would not stand still, but\r\ngave in to the cow as she struggled. It was admirable to see with what\r\ndexterity St. Jago dodged behind the beast, till at last he contrived\r\nto give the fatal touch to the main tendon of the hind leg; after\r\nwhich, without much difficulty, he drove his knife into the head of the\r\nspinal marrow, and the cow dropped as if struck by lightning. He cut\r\noff pieces of flesh with the skin to it, but without any bones,\r\nsufficient for our expedition. We then rode on to our sleeping-place,\r\nand had for supper “carne con cuero,” or meat roasted with the skin on\r\nit. This is as superior to common beef as venison is to mutton. A large\r\ncircular piece taken from the back is roasted on the embers with the\r\nhide downwards and in the form of a saucer, so that none of the gravy\r\nis lost. If any\r\nworthy alderman had supped with us that evening, “carne con cuero,”\r\nwithout doubt, would soon have been celebrated in London.\r\n\r\nDuring the night it rained, and the next day (17th) was very stormy,\r\nwith much hail and snow. We rode across the island to the neck of land\r\nwhich joins the Rincon del Tor (the great peninsula at the S.W.\r\nextremity) to the rest of the island. From the great number of cows\r\nwhich have been killed, there is a large proportion of bulls. These\r\nwander about single, or two and three together, and are very savage. I\r\nnever saw such magnificent beasts; they equalled in the size of their\r\nhuge heads and necks the Grecian marble sculptures. Captain Sulivan\r\ninforms me that the hide of an average-sized bull weighs forty-seven\r\npounds, whereas a hide of this weight, less thoroughly dried, is\r\nconsidered as a very heavy one at Monte Video. The young bulls\r\ngenerally run away for a short distance; but the old ones do not stir a\r\nstep, except to rush at man and horse; and many horses have been thus\r\nkilled. An old bull crossed a boggy stream, and took his stand on the\r\nopposite side to us; we in vain tried to drive him away, and failing,\r\nwere obliged to make a large circuit. The Gauchos in revenge determined\r\nto emasculate him and render him for the future harmless. It was very\r\ninteresting to see how art completely mastered force. One lazo was\r\nthrown over his horns as he rushed at the horse, and another round his\r\nhind legs: in a minute the monster was stretched powerless on the\r\nground. After the lazo has once been drawn tightly round the horns of a\r\nfurious animal, it does not at first appear an easy thing to disengage\r\nit again without killing the beast: nor, I apprehend, would it be so if\r\nthe man was by himself. By the aid, however, of a second person\r\nthrowing his lazo so as to catch both hind legs, it is quickly managed:\r\nfor the animal, as long as its hind legs are kept outstretched, is\r\nquite helpless, and the first man can with his hands loosen his lazo\r\nfrom the horns, and then quietly mount his horse; but the moment the\r\nsecond man, by backing ever so little, relaxes the strain, the lazo\r\nslips off the legs of the struggling beast which then rises free,\r\nshakes himself, and vainly rushes at his antagonist.\r\n\r\nDuring our whole ride we saw only one troop of wild horses. These\r\nanimals, as well as the cattle, were introduced by the\r\nFrench in 1764, since which time both have greatly increased. It is a\r\ncurious fact that the horses have never left the eastern end of the\r\nisland, although there is no natural boundary to prevent them from\r\nroaming, and that part of the island is not more tempting than the\r\nrest. The Gauchos whom I asked, though asserting this to be the case,\r\nwere unable to account for it, except from the strong attachment which\r\nhorses have to any locality to which they are accustomed. Considering\r\nthat the island does not appear fully stocked, and that there are no\r\nbeasts of prey, I was particularly curious to know what has checked\r\ntheir originally rapid increase. That in a limited island some check\r\nwould sooner or later supervene, is inevitable; but why has the\r\nincrease of the horse been checked sooner than that of the cattle?\r\nCapt. Sulivan has taken much pains for me in this inquiry. The Gauchos\r\nemployed here attribute it chiefly to the stallions constantly roaming\r\nfrom place to place, and compelling the mares to accompany them,\r\nwhether or not the young foals are able to follow. One Gaucho told\r\nCapt. Sulivan that he had watched a stallion for a whole hour,\r\nviolently kicking and biting a mare till he forced her to leave her\r\nfoal to its fate. Captain Sulivan can so far corroborate this curious\r\naccount, that he has several times found young foals dead, whereas he\r\nhas never found a dead calf. Moreover, the dead bodies of full-grown\r\nhorses are more frequently found, as if more subject to disease or\r\naccidents than those of the cattle. From the softness of the ground\r\ntheir hoofs often grow irregularly to a great length, and this causes\r\nlameness. The predominant colours are roan and iron-grey. All the\r\nhorses bred here, both tame and wild, are rather small-sized, though\r\ngenerally in good condition; and they have lost so much strength, that\r\nthey are unfit to be used in taking wild cattle with the lazo: in\r\nconsequence, it is necessary to go to the great expense of importing\r\nfresh horses from the Plata. At some future period the southern\r\nhemisphere probably will have its breed of Falkland ponies, as the\r\nnorthern has its Shetland breed.\r\n\r\nThe cattle, instead of having degenerated like the horses, seem, as\r\nbefore remarked, to have increased in size; and they are much more\r\nnumerous than the horses. Capt. Sulivan informs me that they vary much\r\nless in the general form of their bodies and in the shape of their\r\nhorns than English cattle. In colour they differ much; and it is a\r\nremarkable circumstance,\r\nthat in different parts of this one small island, different colours\r\npredominate. Round Mount Usborne, at a height of from 1000 to 1500 feet\r\nabove the sea, about half of some of the herds are mouse or lead\r\ncoloured, a tint which is not common in other parts of the island. Near\r\nPort Pleasant dark brown prevails, whereas south of Choiseul Sound\r\n(which almost divides the island into two parts) white beasts with\r\nblack heads and feet are the most common: in all parts black, and some\r\nspotted animals may be observed. Capt. Sulivan remarks that the\r\ndifference in the prevailing colours was so obvious, that in looking\r\nfor the herds near Port Pleasant, they appeared from a long distance\r\nlike black spots, whilst south of Choiseul Sound they appeared like\r\nwhite spots on the hill-sides. Capt. Sulivan thinks that the herds do\r\nnot mingle; and it is a singular fact, that the mouse-coloured cattle,\r\nthough living on the high land, calve about a month earlier in the\r\nseason than the other coloured beasts on the lower land. It is\r\ninteresting thus to find the once domesticated cattle breaking into\r\nthree colours, of which some one colour would in all probability\r\nultimately prevail over the others, if the herd were left undisturbed\r\nfor the next several centuries.\r\n\r\nThe rabbit is another animal which has been introduced, and has\r\nsucceeded very well; so that they abound over large parts of the\r\nisland. Yet, like the horses, they are confined within certain limits;\r\nfor they have not crossed the central chain of hills, nor would they\r\nhave extended even so far as its base, if, as the Gauchos informed me,\r\nsmall colonies had not been carried there. I should not have supposed\r\nthat these animals, natives of Northern Africa, could have existed in a\r\nclimate so humid as this, and which enjoys so little sunshine that even\r\nwheat ripens only occasionally. It is asserted that in Sweden, which\r\nany one would have thought a more favourable climate, the rabbit cannot\r\nlive out of doors. The first few pairs, moreover, had here to contend\r\nagainst pre-existing enemies, in the fox and some large hawks. The\r\nFrench naturalists have considered the black variety a distinct\r\nspecies, and called it Lepus Magellanicus.[5]\r\nThey imagined that Magellan, when talking of an animal under the name\r\nof “conejos” in the Strait of Magellan, referred to this species; but\r\nhe was alluding to a small cavy, which to this day is thus called by\r\nthe Spaniards. The Gauchos laughed at the idea of the black kind being\r\ndifferent from the grey, and they said that at all events it had not\r\nextended its range any farther than the grey kind; that the two were\r\nnever found separate; and that they readily bred together, and produced\r\npiebald offspring. Of the latter I now possess a specimen, and it is\r\nmarked about the head differently from the French specific description.\r\nThis circumstance shows how cautious naturalists should be in making\r\nspecies; for even Cuvier, on looking at the skull of one of these\r\nrabbits, thought it was probably distinct!\r\n\r\n [5] Lesson’s _Zoology of the Voyage of the Coquille_, tome i, p. 168.\r\n All the early voyagers, and especially Bougainville, distinctly state\r\n that the wolf-like fox was the only native animal on the island. The\r\n distinction of the rabbit as a species is taken from peculiarities in\r\n the fur, from the shape of the head, and from the shortness of the\r\n ears. I may here observe that the difference between the Irish and\r\n English hare rests upon nearly similar characters, only more strongly\r\n marked.\r\n\r\nThe only quadruped native to the island[6] is a large wolf-like fox\r\n(Canis antarcticus), which is common to both East and West Falkland. I\r\nhave no doubt it is a peculiar species, and confined to this\r\narchipelago; because many sealers, Gauchos, and Indians, who have\r\nvisited these islands, all maintain that no such animal is found in any\r\npart of South America. Molina, from a similarity in habits, thought\r\nthat this was the same with his “culpeu”;[7] but I have seen both, and\r\nthey are quite distinct. These wolves are well known from Byron’s\r\naccount of their tameness and curiosity, which the sailors, who ran\r\ninto the water to avoid them, mistook for fierceness. To this day their\r\nmanners remain the same. They have been observed to enter a tent, and\r\nactually pull some meat from beneath the head of a sleeping seaman. The\r\nGauchos also have frequently in the evening killed them, by holding out\r\na piece of meat in one hand, and in the other a knife ready to stick\r\nthem. As far as I am aware, there is no other instance in any part of\r\nthe world, of so small a mass of broken land, distant from a continent,\r\npossessing so large an aboriginal quadruped peculiar to itself. Their\r\nnumbers have rapidly decreased; they are already banished from that\r\nhalf of the island which lies to the eastward of the neck of land\r\nbetween St. Salvador Bay and Berkeley Sound.\r\nWithin a very few years after these islands shall have become regularly\r\nsettled, in all probability this fox will be classed with the dodo, as\r\nan animal which has perished from the face of the earth.\r\n\r\n [6] I have reason, however, to suspect that there is a field-mouse.\r\n The common European rat and mouse have roamed far from the habitations\r\n of the settlers. The common hog has also run wild on one islet; all\r\n are of a black colour: the boars are very fierce, and have great\r\n tusks.\r\n\r\n\r\n [7] The “culpeu” is the Canis Magellanicus brought home by Captain\r\n King from the Strait of Magellan. It is common in Chile.\r\n\r\nAt night (17th) we slept on the neck of land at the head of Choiseul\r\nSound, which forms the south-west peninsula. The valley was pretty well\r\nsheltered from the cold wind; but there was very little brushwood for\r\nfuel. The Gauchos, however, soon found what, to my great surprise, made\r\nnearly as hot a fire as coals; this was the skeleton of a bullock\r\nlately killed, from which the flesh had been picked by the\r\ncarrion-hawks. They told me that in winter they often killed a beast,\r\ncleaned the flesh from the bones with their knives and then with these\r\nsame bones roasted the meat for their suppers.\r\n\r\n\r\n18_th._—It rained during nearly the whole day. At night we managed,\r\nhowever, with our saddle-cloths to keep ourselves pretty well dry and\r\nwarm; but the ground on which we slept was on each occasion nearly in\r\nthe state of a bog, and there was not a dry spot to sit down on after\r\nour day’s ride. I have in another part stated how singular it is that\r\nthere should be absolutely no trees on these islands, although Tierra\r\ndel Fuego is covered by one large forest. The largest bush in the\r\nisland (belonging to the family of Compositæ) is scarcely so tall as\r\nour gorse. The best fuel is afforded by a green little bush about the\r\nsize of common heath, which has the useful property of burning while\r\nfresh and green. It was very surprising to see the Gauchos, in the\r\nmidst of rain and everything soaking wet, with nothing more than a\r\ntinder-box and a piece of rag, immediately make a fire. They sought\r\nbeneath the tufts of grass and bushes for a few dry twigs, and these\r\nthey rubbed into fibres; then surrounding them with coarser twigs,\r\nsomething like a bird’s nest, they put the rag with its spark of fire\r\nin the middle and covered it up. The nest being then held up to the\r\nwind, by degrees it smoked more and more, and at last burst out in\r\nflames. I do not think any other method would have had a chance of\r\nsucceeding with such damp materials.\r\n\r\n\r\n19_th._—Each morning, from not having ridden for some time previously,\r\nI was very stiff. I was surprised to hear the\r\nGauchos, who have from infancy almost lived on horseback, say that,\r\nunder similar circumstances, they always suffer. St. Jago told me, that\r\nhaving been confined for three months by illness, he went out hunting\r\nwild cattle, and in consequence, for the next two days, his thighs were\r\nso stiff that he was obliged to lie in bed. This shows that the\r\nGauchos, although they do not appear to do so, yet really must exert\r\nmuch muscular effort in riding. The hunting wild cattle, in a country\r\nso difficult to pass as this is on account of the swampy ground, must\r\nbe very hard work. The Gauchos say they often pass at full speed over\r\nground which would be impassable at a slower pace; in the same manner\r\nas a man is able to skate over thin ice. When hunting, the party\r\nendeavours to get as close as possible to the herd without being\r\ndiscovered. Each man carries four or five pair of the bolas; these he\r\nthrows one after the other at as many cattle, which, when once\r\nentangled, are left for some days, till they become a little exhausted\r\nby hunger and struggling. They are then let free and driven towards a\r\nsmall herd of tame animals, which have been brought to the spot on\r\npurpose. From their previous treatment, being too much terrified to\r\nleave the herd, they are easily driven, if their strength last out, to\r\nthe settlement.\r\n\r\nThe weather continued so very bad that we determine to make a push, and\r\ntry to reach the vessel before night. From the quantity of rain which\r\nhad fallen, the surface of the whole country was swampy. I suppose my\r\nhorse fell at least a dozen times, and sometimes the whole six horses\r\nwere floundering in the mud together. All the little streams are\r\nbordered by soft peat, which makes it very difficult for the horses to\r\nleap them without falling. To complete our discomforts we were obliged\r\nto cross the head of a creek of the sea, in which the water was as high\r\nas our horses’ backs; and the little waves, owing to the violence of\r\nthe wind, broke over us, and made us very wet and cold. Even the\r\niron-framed Gauchos professed themselves glad when they reached the\r\nsettlement, after our little excursion.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe geological structure of these islands is in most respects simple.\r\nThe lower country consists of clay-slate and sandstone, containing\r\nfossils, very closely related to, but not identical with,\r\nthose found in the Silurian formations of Europe; the hills are formed\r\nof white granular quartz rock. The strata of the latter are frequently\r\narched with perfect symmetry, and the appearance of some of the masses\r\nis in consequence most singular. Pernety[8] has devoted several pages\r\nto the description of a Hill of Ruins, the successive strata of which\r\nhe has justly compared to the seats of an amphitheatre. The quartz rock\r\nmust have been quite pasty when it underwent such remarkable flexures\r\nwithout being shattered into fragments. As the quartz insensibly passes\r\ninto the sandstone, it seems probable that the former owes its origin\r\nto the sandstone having been heated to such a degree that it became\r\nviscid, and upon cooling crystallised. While in the soft state it must\r\nhave been pushed up through the overlying beds.\r\n\r\n [8] Pernety, _Voyage aux Isles Malouines_, p. 526.\r\n\r\nIn many parts of the island the bottoms of the valleys are covered in\r\nan extraordinary manner by myriads of great loose angular fragments of\r\nthe quartz rock, forming “streams of stones.” These have been mentioned\r\nwith surprise by every voyager since the time of Pernety. The blocks\r\nare not waterworn, their angles being only a little blunted; they vary\r\nin size from one or two feet in diameter to ten, or even more than\r\ntwenty times as much. They are not thrown together into irregular\r\npiles, but are spread out into level sheets or great streams. It is not\r\npossible to ascertain their thickness, but the water of small\r\nstreamlets can be heard trickling through the stones many feet below\r\nthe surface. The actual depth is probably great, because the crevices\r\nbetween the lower fragments must long ago have been filled up with\r\nsand. The width of these sheets of stones varies from a few hundred\r\nfeet to a mile; but the peaty soil daily encroaches on the borders, and\r\neven forms islets wherever a few fragments happen to lie close\r\ntogether. In a valley south of Berkeley Sound, which some of our party\r\ncalled the “great valley of fragments,” it was necessary to cross an\r\nuninterrupted band half a mile wide, by jumping from one pointed stone\r\nto another. So large were the fragments, that being overtaken by a\r\nshower of rain, I readily found shelter beneath one of them.\r\n\r\nTheir little inclination is the most remarkable circumstance in these\r\n“streams of stones.” On the hill-sides I have seen\r\nthem sloping at an angle of ten degrees with the horizon; but in some\r\nof the level, broad-bottomed valleys, the inclination is only just\r\nsufficient to be clearly perceived. On so rugged a surface there was no\r\nmeans of measuring the angle; but to give a common illustration, I may\r\nsay that the slope would not have checked the speed of an English\r\nmail-coach. In some places a continuous stream of these fragments\r\nfollowed up the course of a valley, and even extended to the very crest\r\nof the hill. On these crests huge masses, exceeding in dimensions any\r\nsmall building, seemed to stand arrested in their headlong course:\r\nthere, also, the curved strata of the archways lay piled on each other,\r\nlike the ruins of some vast and ancient cathedral. In endeavouring to\r\ndescribe these scenes of violence one is tempted to pass from one\r\nsimile to another. We may imagine that streams of white lava had flowed\r\nfrom many parts of the mountains into the lower country, and that when\r\nsolidified they had been rent by some enormous convulsion into myriads\r\nof fragments. The expression “streams of stones,” which immediately\r\noccurred to every one, conveys the same idea. These scenes are on the\r\nspot rendered more striking by the contrast of the low, rounded forms\r\nof the neighbouring hills.\r\n\r\nI was interested by finding on the highest peak of one range (about 700\r\nfeet above the sea) a great arched fragment, lying on its convex side,\r\nor back downwards. Must we believe that it was fairly pitched up in the\r\nair, and thus turned? Or, with more probability, that there existed\r\nformerly a part of the same range more elevated than the point on which\r\nthis monument of a great convulsion of nature now lies. As the\r\nfragments in the valleys are neither rounded nor the crevices filled up\r\nwith sand, we must infer that the period of violence was subsequent to\r\nthe land having been raised above the waters of the sea. In a\r\ntransverse section within these valleys the bottom is nearly level, or\r\nrises but very little towards either side. Hence the fragments appear\r\nto have travelled from the head of the valley; but in reality it seems\r\nmore probable that they have been hurled down from the nearest slopes;\r\nand that since, by a vibratory movement of overwhelming force,[9] the\r\nfragments have been levelled into one continuous sheet. If during the\r\nearthquake[10] which in 1835 overthrew Concepcion, in Chile, it was\r\nthought wonderful that small bodies should have been pitched a few\r\ninches from the ground, what must we say to a movement which has caused\r\nfragments many tons in weight to move onwards like so much sand on a\r\nvibrating board, and find their level? I have seen, in the Cordillera\r\nof the Andes, the evident marks where stupendous mountains have been\r\nbroken into pieces like so much thin crust, and the strata thrown on\r\ntheir vertical edges; but never did any scene, like these “streams of\r\nstones,” so forcibly convey to my mind the idea of a convulsion, of\r\nwhich in historical records we might in vain seek for any counterpart:\r\nyet the progress of knowledge will probably some day give a simple\r\nexplanation of this phenomenon, as it already has of the so long\r\nthought inexplicable transportal of the erratic boulders which are\r\nstrewed over the plains of Europe.\r\n\r\n [9] “Nous n’avons pas été moins saisis d’étonnement à la vûe de\r\n l’innombrable quantité de pierres de toutes grandeurs, bouleversées\r\n les unes sur les autres, et cependant rangées, comme si elles avoient\r\n été amoncelées négligemment pour remplir des ravins. On ne se lassoit\r\n pas d’admirer les effets prodigieux de la nature.”—_Pernety_, p. 526.\r\n\r\n\r\n [10] An inhabitant of Mendoza, and hence well capable of judging,\r\n assured me that, during the several years he had resided on these\r\n islands, he had never felt the slightest shock of an earthquake.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have little to remark on the zoology of these islands. I have before\r\ndescribed the carrion-vulture of Polyborus. There are some other hawks,\r\nowls, and a few small land-birds. The waterfowl are particularly\r\nnumerous, and they must formerly, from the accounts of the old\r\nnavigators, have been much more so. One day I observed a cormorant\r\nplaying with a fish which it had caught. Eight times successively the\r\nbird let its prey go, then dived after it, and although in deep water,\r\nbrought it each time to the surface. In the Zoological Gardens I have\r\nseen the otter treat a fish in the same manner, much as a cat does a\r\nmouse: I do not know of any other instance where dame Nature appears so\r\nwilfully cruel. Another day, having placed myself between a penguin\r\n(Aptenodytes demersa) and the water, I was much amused by watching its\r\nhabits. It was a brave bird; and till reaching the sea, it regularly\r\nfought and drove me backwards. Nothing less than heavy blows would have\r\nstopped him; every inch he gained he firmly kept, standing\r\nclose before me erect and determined. When thus opposed he continually\r\nrolled his head from side to side, in a very odd manner, as if the\r\npower of distinct vision lay only in the anterior and basal part of\r\neach eye. This bird is commonly called the jackass penguin, from its\r\nhabit, while on shore, of throwing its head backwards, and making a\r\nloud strange noise, very like the braying of an ass; but while at sea,\r\nand undisturbed, its note is very deep and solemn, and is often heard\r\nin the night-time. In diving, its little wings are used as fins; but on\r\nthe land, as front legs. When crawling, it may be said on four legs,\r\nthrough the tussocks or on the side of a grassy cliff, it moves so very\r\nquickly that it might easily be mistaken for a quadruped. When at sea\r\nand fishing, it comes to the surface for the purpose of breathing with\r\nsuch a spring, and dives again so instantaneously, that I defy any one\r\nat first sight to be sure that it was not a fish leaping for sport.\r\n\r\nTwo kinds of geese frequent the Falklands. The upland species (Anas\r\nMagellanica) is common, in pairs and in small flocks, throughout the\r\nisland. They do not migrate, but build on the small outlying islets.\r\nThis is supposed to be from fear of the foxes: and it is perhaps from\r\nthe same cause that these birds, though very tame by day, are shy and\r\nwild in the dusk of the evening. They live entirely on vegetable\r\nmatter. The rock-goose, so called from living exclusively on the\r\nsea-beach (Anas antarctica), is common both here and on the west coast\r\nof America, as far north as Chile. In the deep and retired channels of\r\nTierra del Fuego, the snow-white gander, invariably accompanied by his\r\ndarker consort, and standing close by each other on some distant rocky\r\npoint, is a common feature in the landscape.\r\n\r\nIn these islands a great loggerheaded duck or goose (Anas brachyptera),\r\nwhich sometimes weighs twenty-two pounds, is very abundant. These birds\r\nwere in former days called, from their extraordinary manner of paddling\r\nand splashing upon the water, racehorses; but now they are named, much\r\nmore appropriately, steamers. Their wings are too small and weak to\r\nallow of flight, but by their aid, partly swimming and partly flapping\r\nthe surface of the water, they move very quickly. The manner is\r\nsomething like that by which the common house-duck escapes when pursued\r\nby a dog; but I am nearly sure that the steamer\r\nmoves its wings alternately, instead of both together, as in other\r\nbirds. These clumsy, loggerheaded ducks make such a noise and\r\nsplashing, that the effect is exceedingly curious.\r\n\r\nThus we find in South America three birds which use their wings for\r\nother purposes besides flight; the penguin as fins, the steamer as\r\npaddles, and the ostrich as sails: and the Apteryx of New Zealand, as\r\nwell as its gigantic extinct prototype the Deinornis, possess only\r\nrudimentary representatives of wings. The steamer is able to dive only\r\nto a very short distance. It feeds entirely on shell-fish from the kelp\r\nand tidal rocks; hence the beak and head, for the purpose of breaking\r\nthem, are surprisingly heavy and strong: the head is so strong that I\r\nhave scarcely been able to fracture it with my geological hammer; and\r\nall our sportsmen soon discovered how tenacious these birds were of\r\nlife. When in the evening pluming themselves in a flock, they make the\r\nsame odd mixture of sounds which bull-frogs do within the tropics.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Tierra del Fuego, as well as in the Falkland Islands, I made many\r\nobservations on the lower marine animals,[11] but they are of little\r\ngeneral interest. I will mention only one class of facts, relating to\r\ncertain zoophytes in the more highly organised division of that class.\r\nSeveral genera (Flustra, Eschara, Cellaria, Crisia, and others) agree\r\nin having singular movable organs (like those of Flustra avicularia,\r\nfound in the European seas) attached to their cells. The organ, in the\r\ngreater number of cases, very closely resembles the head of a vulture;\r\nbut the lower mandible can be opened much wider than in a real bird’s\r\nbeak. The head itself possesses considerable powers of movement, by\r\nmeans of a short neck. In one zoophyte the head itself was fixed, but\r\nthe lower jaw free: in another it was replaced by\r\na triangular hood, with a beautifully-fitted trap-door, which evidently\r\nanswered to the lower mandible. In the greater number of species, each\r\ncell was provided with one head, but in others each cell had two.\r\n\r\n [11] I was surprised to find, on counting the eggs of a large white\r\n Doris (this sea-slug was three and a half inches long), how\r\n extraordinarily numerous they were. From two to five eggs (each\r\n three-thousandths of an inch in diameter) were contained in spherical\r\n little case. These were arranged two deep in transverse rows forming a\r\n ribbon. The ribbon adhered by its edge to the rock in an oval spire.\r\n One which I found measured nearly twenty inches in length and half in\r\n breadth. By counting how many balls were contained in a tenth of an\r\n inch in the row, and how many rows in an equal length of the ribbon,\r\n on the most moderate computation there were six hundred thousand eggs.\r\n Yet this Doris was certainly not very common: although I was often\r\n searching under the stones, I saw only seven individuals. _No fallacy\r\n is more common with naturalists, than that the numbers of an\r\n individual species depend on its powers of propagation._\r\n\r\nThe young cells at the end of the branches of these corallines contain\r\nquite immature polypi, yet the vulture-heads attached to them, though\r\nsmall, are in every respect perfect. When the polypus was removed by a\r\nneedle from any of the cells, these organs did not appear in the least\r\naffected. When one of the vulture-like heads was cut off from the cell,\r\nthe lower mandible retained its power of opening and closing. Perhaps\r\nthe most singular part of their structure is, that when there were more\r\nthan two rows of cells on a branch, the central cells were furnished\r\nwith these appendages, of only one-fourth the size of the outside ones.\r\nTheir movements varied according to the species; but in some I never\r\nsaw the least motion; while others, with the lower mandible generally\r\nwide open, oscillated backwards and forwards at the rate of about five\r\nseconds each turn; others moved rapidly and by starts. When touched\r\nwith a needle, the beak generally seized the point so firmly that the\r\nwhole branch might be shaken.\r\n\r\nThese bodies have no relation whatever with the production of the eggs\r\nor gemmules, as they are formed before the young polypi appear in the\r\ncells at the end of the growing branches; as they move independently of\r\nthe polypi, and do not appear to be in any way connected with them; and\r\nas they differ in size on the outer and inner rows of cells, I have\r\nlittle doubt that in their functions they are related rather to the\r\nhorny axis of the branches than to the polypi in the cells. The fleshy\r\nappendage at the lower extremity of the sea-pen (described at Bahia\r\nBlanca) also forms part of the zoophyte, as a whole, in the same manner\r\nas the roots of a tree form part of the whole tree, and not of the\r\nindividual leaf or flower-buds.\r\n\r\nIn another elegant little coralline (Crisia?) each cell was furnished\r\nwith a long-toothed bristle, which had the power of moving quickly.\r\nEach of these bristles and each of the vulture-like heads generally\r\nmoved quite independently of the others, but sometimes all on both\r\nsides of a branch, sometimes only those on one side, moved together\r\ncoinstantaneously; sometimes each moved in regular order one after\r\nanother. In these actions we\r\napparently behold as perfect a transmission of will in the zoophyte,\r\nthough composed of thousands of distinct polypi, as in any single\r\nanimal. The case, indeed, is not different from that of the sea-pens,\r\nwhich, when touched, drew themselves into the sand on the coast of\r\nBahia Blanca. I will state one other instance of uniform action, though\r\nof a very different nature, in a zoophyte closely allied to Clytia, and\r\ntherefore very simply organised. Having kept a large tuft of it in a\r\nbasin of salt-water, when it was dark I found that as often as I rubbed\r\nany part of a branch, the whole became strongly phosphorescent with a\r\ngreen light: I do not think I ever saw any object more beautifully so.\r\nBut the remarkable circumstance was, that the flashes of light always\r\nproceeded up the branches, from the base towards the extremities.\r\n\r\nThe examination of these compound animals was always very interesting\r\nto me. What can be more remarkable than to see a plant-like body\r\nproducing an egg, capable of swimming about and of choosing a proper\r\nplace to adhere to, which then sprouts into branches, each crowded with\r\ninnumerable distinct animals, often of complicated organisations. The\r\nbranches, moreover, as we have just seen, sometimes possess organs\r\ncapable of movement and independent of the polypi. Surprising as this\r\nunion of separate individuals in a common stock must always appear,\r\nevery tree displays the same fact, for buds must be considered as\r\nindividual plants. It is, however, natural to consider a polypus,\r\nfurnished with a mouth, intestines, and other organs, as a distinct\r\nindividual, whereas the individuality of a leaf-bud is not easily\r\nrealised; so that the union of separate individuals in a common body is\r\nmore striking in a coralline than in a tree. Our conception of a\r\ncompound animal, where in some respects the individuality of each is\r\nnot completed, may be aided, by reflecting on the production of two\r\ndistinct creatures by bisecting a single one with a knife, or where\r\nNature herself performs the task of bisection. We may consider the\r\npolypi in a zoophyte, or the buds in a tree, as cases where the\r\ndivision of the individual has not been completely effected. Certainly\r\nin the case of trees, and judging from analogy in that of corallines,\r\nthe individuals propagated by buds seem more intimately related to each\r\nother, than eggs or seeds are to their parents. It seems now pretty\r\nwell established that plants propagated by buds all\r\npartake of a common duration of life; and it is familiar to every one,\r\nwhat singular and numerous peculiarities are transmitted with\r\ncertainty, by buds, layers, and grafts, which by seminal propagation\r\nnever or only casually reappear.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Berkeley Sound, Falkland Islands.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: York Minster, bearing S. 66° E.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter X\r\n\r\n\r\nTierra del Fuego, first arrival—Good Success Bay—An account of the\r\nFuegians on board—Interview with the savages—Scenery of the\r\nforests—Cape Horn—Wigwam Cove—Miserable condition of the\r\nsavages—Famines—Cannibals—Matricide—Religious feelings—Great\r\ngale—Beagle Channel—Ponsonby Sound—Build wigwams and settle the\r\nFuegians—Bifurcation of the Beagle Channel—Glaciers—Return to the\r\nship—Second visit in the ship to the settlement—Equality of condition\r\namongst the natives.\r\n\r\nTIERRA DEL FUEGO.\r\n\r\n_December_ 17_th_, 1832.—Having now finished with Patagonia and the\r\nFalkland Islands, I will describe our first arrival in Tierra del\r\nFuego. A little after noon we doubled Cape St. Diego, and entered the\r\nfamous Strait of Le Maire. We kept close to the Fuegian shore, but the\r\noutline of the rugged, inhospitable Staten-land was visible amidst the\r\nclouds. In the afternoon we anchored in the Bay of Good Success. While\r\nentering we were saluted in a manner becoming the inhabitants of this\r\nsavage land. A group of Fuegians partly concealed by the entangled\r\nforest, were perched on a wild point overhanging the\r\nsea; and as we passed by, they sprang up and waving their tattered\r\ncloaks sent forth a loud and sonorous shout. The savages followed the\r\nship, and just before dark we saw their fire, and again heard their\r\nwild cry. The harbour consists of a fine piece of water half surrounded\r\nby low rounded mountains of clay-slate, which are covered to the\r\nwater’s edge by one dense gloomy forest. A single glance at the\r\nlandscape was sufficient to show me how widely different it was from\r\nanything I had ever beheld. At night it blew a gale of wind, and heavy\r\nsqualls from the mountains swept past us. It would have been a bad time\r\nout at sea, and we, as well as others, may call this Good Success Bay.\r\n\r\nIn the morning the Captain sent a party to communicate with the\r\nFuegians. When we came within hail, one of the four natives who were\r\npresent advanced to receive us, and began to shout most vehemently,\r\nwishing to direct us where to land. When we were on shore the party\r\nlooked rather alarmed, but continued talking and making gestures with\r\ngreat rapidity. It was without exception the most curious and\r\ninteresting spectacle I ever beheld: I could not have believed how wide\r\nwas the difference between savage and civilised man: it is greater than\r\nbetween a wild and domesticated animal, inasmuch as in man there is a\r\ngreater power of improvement. The chief spokesman was old, and appeared\r\nto be the head of the family; the three others were powerful young men,\r\nabout six feet high. The women and children had been sent away. These\r\nFuegians are a very different race from the stunted, miserable wretches\r\nfarther westward; and they seem closely allied to the famous\r\nPatagonians of the Strait of Magellan. Their only garment consists of a\r\nmantle made of guanaco skin, with the wool outside: this they wear just\r\nthrown over their shoulders, leaving their persons as often exposed as\r\ncovered. Their skin is of a dirty coppery-red colour.\r\n\r\nThe old man had a fillet of white feathers tied round his head, which\r\npartly confined his black, coarse, and entangled hair. His face was\r\ncrossed by two broad transverse bars; one, painted bright red, reached\r\nfrom ear to ear and included the upper lip; the other, white like\r\nchalk, extended above and parallel to the first, so that even his\r\neyelids were thus coloured. The other two men were ornamented by\r\nstreaks of black powder, made of\r\ncharcoal. The party altogether closely resembled the devils which come\r\non the stage in plays like Der Freischutz.\r\n\r\nTheir very attitudes were abject, and the expression of their\r\ncountenances distrustful, surprised, and startled. After we had\r\npresented them with some scarlet cloth, which they immediately tied\r\nround their necks, they became good friends. This was shown by the old\r\nman patting our breasts, and making a chuckling kind of noise, as\r\npeople do when feeding chickens. I walked with the old man, and this\r\ndemonstration of friendship was repeated several times; it was\r\nconcluded by three hard slaps, which were given me on the breast and\r\nback at the same time. He then bared his bosom for me to return the\r\ncompliment, which being done, he seemed highly pleased. The language of\r\nthese people, according to our notions, scarcely deserves to be called\r\narticulate. Captain Cook has compared it to a man clearing his throat,\r\nbut certainly no European ever cleared his throat with so many hoarse,\r\nguttural, and clicking sounds.\r\n\r\nThey are excellent mimics: as often as we coughed or yawned, or made\r\nany odd motion, they immediately imitated us. Some of our party began\r\nto squint and look awry; but one of the young Fuegians (whose whole\r\nface was painted black, excepting a white band across his eyes)\r\nsucceeded in making far more hideous grimaces. They could repeat with\r\nperfect correctness each word in any sentence we addressed them, and\r\nthey remembered such words for some time. Yet we Europeans all know how\r\ndifficult it is to distinguish apart the sounds in a foreign language.\r\nWhich of us, for instance, could follow an American Indian through a\r\nsentence of more than three words? All savages appear to possess, to an\r\nuncommon degree, this power of mimicry. I was told, almost in the same\r\nwords, of the same ludicrous habit among the Caffres; the Australians,\r\nlikewise, have long been notorious for being able to imitate and\r\ndescribe the gait of any man, so that he may be recognised. How can\r\nthis faculty be explained? is it a consequence of the more practised\r\nhabits of perception and keener senses, common to all men in a savage\r\nstate, as compared with those long civilised?\r\n\r\nWhen a song was struck up by our party, I thought the Fuegians would\r\nhave fallen down with astonishment. With equal surprise they viewed our\r\ndancing; but one of the young men, when asked, had no objection to a\r\nlittle waltzing. Little\r\naccustomed to Europeans as they appeared to be, yet they knew and\r\ndreaded our firearms; nothing would tempt them to take a gun in their\r\nhands. They begged for knives, calling them by the Spanish word\r\n“cuchilla.” They explained also what they wanted, by acting as if they\r\nhad a piece of blubber in their mouth, and then pretending to cut\r\ninstead of tear it.\r\n\r\nI have not as yet noticed the Fuegians whom we had on board. During the\r\nformer voyage of the _Adventure_ and _Beagle_ in 1826 to 1830, Captain\r\nFitz Roy seized on a party of natives, as hostages for the loss of a\r\nboat, which had been stolen, to the great jeopardy of a party employed\r\non the survey; and some of these natives, as well as a child whom he\r\nbought for a pearl-button, he took with him to England, determining to\r\neducate them and instruct them in religion at his own expense. To\r\nsettle these natives in their own country was one chief inducement to\r\nCaptain Fitz Roy to undertake our present voyage; and before the\r\nAdmiralty had resolved to send out this expedition, Captain Fitz Roy\r\nhad generously chartered a vessel, and would himself have taken them\r\nback. The natives were accompanied by a missionary, R. Matthews; of\r\nwhom and of the natives, Captain Fitz Roy has published a full and\r\nexcellent account. Two men, one of whom died in England of the\r\nsmallpox, a boy and a little girl, were originally taken; and we had\r\nnow on board, York Minster, Jemmy Button (whose name expresses his\r\npurchase-money), and Fuegia Basket. York Minster was a full-grown,\r\nshort, thick, powerful man: his disposition was reserved, taciturn,\r\nmorose, and when excited violently passionate; his affections were very\r\nstrong towards a few friends on board; his intellect good. Jemmy Button\r\nwas a universal favourite, but likewise passionate; the expression of\r\nhis face at once showed his nice disposition. He was merry and often\r\nlaughed, and was remarkably sympathetic with any one in pain: when the\r\nwater was rough, I was often a little sea-sick, and he used to come to\r\nme and say in a plaintive voice, “Poor, poor fellow!” but the notion,\r\nafter his aquatic life, of a man being sea-sick, was too ludicrous, and\r\nhe was generally obliged to turn on one side to hide a smile or laugh,\r\nand then he would repeat his “Poor, poor fellow!” He was of a patriotic\r\ndisposition; and he liked to praise his own tribe and country, in which\r\nhe truly said there were “plenty of trees,” and he abused all the other\r\ntribes: he stoutly declared that there\r\nwas no Devil in his land. Jemmy was short, thick, and fat, but vain of\r\nhis personal appearance; he used always to wear gloves, his hair was\r\nneatly cut, and he was distressed if his well-polished shoes were\r\ndirtied. He was fond of admiring himself in a looking glass; and a\r\nmerry-faced little Indian boy from the Rio Negro, whom we had for some\r\nmonths on board, soon perceived this, and used to mock him: Jemmy, who\r\nwas always rather jealous of the attention paid to this little boy, did\r\nnot at all like this, and used to say, with rather a contemptuous twist\r\nof his head, “Too much skylark.” It seems yet wonderful to me, when I\r\nthink over all his many good qualities, that he should have been of the\r\nsame race, and doubtless partaken of the same character, with the\r\nmiserable, degraded savages whom we first met here. Lastly, Fuegia\r\nBasket was a nice, modest, reserved young girl, with a rather pleasing\r\nbut sometimes sullen expression, and very quick in learning anything,\r\nespecially languages. This she showed in picking up some Portuguese and\r\nSpanish, when left on shore for only a short time at Rio de Janeiro and\r\nMonte Video, and in her knowledge of English. York Minster was very\r\njealous of any attention paid to her; for it was clear he determined to\r\nmarry her as soon as they were settled on shore.\r\n\r\nAlthough all three could both speak and understand a good deal of\r\nEnglish, it was singularly difficult to obtain much information from\r\nthem concerning the habits of their countrymen; this was partly owing\r\nto their apparent difficulty in understanding the simplest alternative.\r\nEvery one accustomed to very young children knows how seldom one can\r\nget an answer even to so simple a question as whether a thing is black\r\n_or_ white; the idea of black or white seems alternately to fill their\r\nminds. So it was with these Fuegians, and hence it was generally\r\nimpossible to find out, by cross-questioning, whether one had rightly\r\nunderstood anything which they had asserted. Their sight was remarkably\r\nacute; it is well known that sailors, from long practice, can make out\r\na distant object much better than a landsman; but both York and Jemmy\r\nwere much superior to any sailor on board: several times they have\r\ndeclared what some distant object has been, and though doubted by every\r\none, they have proved right when it has been examined through a\r\ntelescope. They were quite conscious of this power; and Jemmy, when he\r\nhad any little quarrel\r\nwith the officer on watch, would say, “Me see ship, me no tell.”\r\n\r\nIt was interesting to watch the conduct of the savages, when we landed,\r\ntowards Jemmy Button: they immediately perceived the difference between\r\nhim and ourselves, and held much conversation one with another on the\r\nsubject. The old man addressed a long harangue to Jemmy, which it seems\r\nwas to invite him to stay with them. But Jemmy understood very little\r\nof their language, and was, moreover, thoroughly ashamed of his\r\ncountrymen. When York Minster afterwards came on shore, they noticed\r\nhim in the same way, and told him he ought to shave; yet he had not\r\ntwenty dwarf hairs on his face, whilst we all wore our untrimmed\r\nbeards. They examined the colour of his skin, and compared it with\r\nours. One of our arms being bared, they expressed the liveliest\r\nsurprise and admiration at its whiteness, just in the same way in which\r\nI have seen the ourang-outang do at the Zoological Gardens. We thought\r\nthat they mistook two or three of the officers, who were rather shorter\r\nand fairer, though adorned with large beards, for the ladies of our\r\nparty. The tallest amongst the Fuegians was evidently much pleased at\r\nhis height being noticed. When placed back to back with the tallest of\r\nthe boat’s crew, he tried his best to edge on higher ground, and to\r\nstand on tiptoe. He opened his mouth to show his teeth, and turned his\r\nface for a side view; and all this was done with such alacrity, that I\r\ndaresay he thought himself the handsomest man in Tierra del Fuego.\r\nAfter our first feeling of grave astonishment was over, nothing could\r\nbe more ludicrous than the odd mixture of surprise and imitation which\r\nthese savages every moment exhibited.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day I attempted to penetrate some way into the country. Tierra\r\ndel Fuego may be described as a mountainous land, partly submerged in\r\nthe sea, so that deep inlets and bays occupy the place where valleys\r\nshould exist. The mountain sides, except on the exposed western coast,\r\nare covered from the water’s edge upwards by one great forest. The\r\ntrees reach to an elevation of between 1000 and 1500 feet, and are\r\nsucceeded by a band of peat, with minute alpine plants; and this again\r\nis succeeded by the line of perpetual snow, which,\r\naccording to Captain King, in the Strait of Magellan descends to\r\nbetween 3000 and 4000 feet. To find an acre of level land in any part\r\nof the country is most rare. I recollect only one little flat piece\r\nnear Port Famine, and another of rather larger extent near Goeree Road.\r\nIn both places, and everywhere else, the surface is covered by a thick\r\nbed of swampy peat. Even within the forest, the ground is concealed by\r\na mass of slowly putrefying vegetable matter, which, from being soaked\r\nwith water, yields to the foot.\r\n\r\nFinding it nearly hopeless to push my way through the wood, I followed\r\nthe course of a mountain torrent. At first, from the waterfalls and\r\nnumber of dead trees, I could hardly crawl along; but the bed of the\r\nstream soon became a little more open, from the floods having swept the\r\nsides. I continued slowly to advance for an hour along the broken and\r\nrocky banks, and was amply repaid by the grandeur of the scene. The\r\ngloomy depth of the ravine well accorded with the universal signs of\r\nviolence. On every side were lying irregular masses of rock and torn-up\r\ntrees; other trees, though still erect, were decayed to the heart and\r\nready to fall. The entangled mass of the thriving and the fallen\r\nreminded me of the forests within the tropics—yet there was a\r\ndifference: for in these still solitudes, Death, instead of Life,\r\nseemed the predominant spirit. I followed the watercourse till I came\r\nto a spot where a great slip had cleared a straight space down the\r\nmountain side. By this road I ascended to a considerable elevation, and\r\nobtained a good view of the surrounding woods. The trees all belong to\r\none kind, the Fagus betuloides; for the number of the other species of\r\nFagus and of the Winter’s Bark is quite inconsiderable. This beech\r\nkeeps its leaves throughout the year; but its foliage is of a peculiar\r\nbrownish-green colour, with a tinge of yellow. As the whole landscape\r\nis thus coloured, it has a sombre, dull appearance; nor is it often\r\nenlivened by the rays of the sun.\r\n\r\n_December_ 20_th._—One side of the harbour is formed by a hill about\r\n1500 feet high, which Captain Fitz Roy has called after Sir J. Banks,\r\nin commemoration of his disastrous excursion which proved fatal to two\r\nmen of his party, and nearly so to Dr. Solander. The snow-storm, which\r\nwas the cause of their misfortune, happened in the middle of January,\r\ncorresponding\r\nto our July, and in the latitude of Durham! I was anxious to reach the\r\nsummit of this mountain to collect alpine plants; for flowers of any\r\nkind in the lower parts are few in number. We followed the same\r\nwatercourse as on the previous day, till it dwindled away, and we were\r\nthen compelled to crawl blindly among the trees. These, from the\r\neffects of the elevation and of the impetuous winds, were low, thick\r\nand crooked. At length we reached that which from a distance appeared\r\nlike a carpet of fine green turf, but which, to our vexation, turned\r\nout to be a compact mass of little beech-trees about four or five feet\r\nhigh. They were as thick together as box in the border of a garden, and\r\nwe were obliged to struggle over the flat but treacherous surface.\r\nAfter a little more trouble we gained the peat, and then the bare slate\r\nrock.\r\n\r\nCape Horn\r\n\r\nA ridge connected this hill with another, distant some miles, and more\r\nlofty, so that patches of snow were lying on it. As the day was not far\r\nadvanced, I determined to walk there and collect plants along the road.\r\nIt would have been very hard work, had it not been for a well-beaten\r\nand straight path made by the guanacos; for these animals, like sheep,\r\nalways follow the same line. When we reached the hill we found it the\r\nhighest in the immediate neighbourhood, and the waters flowed to the\r\nsea in opposite directions. We obtained a wide view over the\r\nsurrounding country: to the north a swampy moorland extended, but to\r\nthe south we had a scene of savage\r\nmagnificence, well becoming Tierra del Fuego. There was a degree of\r\nmysterious grandeur in mountain behind mountain, with the deep\r\nintervening valleys, all covered by one thick, dusky mass of forest.\r\nThe atmosphere, likewise, in this climate, where gale succeeds gale,\r\nwith rain, hail, and sleet, seems blacker than anywhere else. In the\r\nStrait of Magellan, looking due southward from Port Famine, the distant\r\nchannels between the mountains appeared from their gloominess to lead\r\nbeyond the confines of this world.\r\n\r\nCape Horn (another view)\r\n\r\n_December_ 21_st._—The _Beagle_ got under way: and on the succeeding\r\nday, favoured to an uncommon degree by a fine easterly breeze, we\r\nclosed in with the Barnevelts, and running past Cape Deceit with its\r\nstony peaks, about three o’clock doubled the weather-beaten Cape Horn.\r\nThe evening was calm and bright, and we enjoyed a fine view of the\r\nsurrounding isles. Cape Horn, however, demanded his tribute, and before\r\nnight sent us a gale of wind directly in our teeth. We stood out to\r\nsea, and on the second day again made the land, when we saw on our\r\nweather-bow this notorious promontory in its proper form—veiled in a\r\nmist, and its dim outline surrounded by a storm of wind and water.\r\nGreat black clouds were rolling across the heavens, and squalls of\r\nrain, with hail, swept by us with such extreme violence, that the\r\nCaptain determined to run into Wigwam Cove. This is a snug little\r\nharbour, not far from Cape Horn; and here, at Christmas-eve, we\r\nanchored in\r\nsmooth water. The only thing which reminded us of the gale outside was\r\nevery now and then a puff from the mountains, which made the ship surge\r\nat her anchors.\r\n\r\n_December_ 25_th._—Close by the cove, a pointed hill, called Kater’s\r\nPeak, rises to the height of 1700 feet. The surrounding islands all\r\nconsist of conical masses of greenstone, associated sometimes with less\r\nregular hills of baked and altered clay-slate. This part of Tierra del\r\nFuego may be considered as the extremity of the submerged chain of\r\nmountains already alluded to. The cove takes its name of “Wigwam” from\r\nsome of the Fuegian habitations; but every bay in the neighbourhood\r\nmight be so called with equal propriety. The inhabitants, living\r\nchiefly upon shell-fish, are obliged constantly to change their place\r\nof residence; but they return at intervals to the same spots, as is\r\nevident from the piles of old shells, which must often amount to many\r\ntons in weight. These heaps can be distinguished at a long distance by\r\nthe bright green colour of certain plants, which invariably grow on\r\nthem. Among these may be enumerated the wild celery and scurvy grass,\r\ntwo very serviceable plants, the use of which has not been discovered\r\nby the natives.\r\n\r\nThe Fuegian wigwam resembles, in size and dimensions, a haycock. It\r\nmerely consists of a few broken branches stuck in the ground, and very\r\nimperfectly thatched on one side with a few tufts of grass and rushes.\r\nThe whole cannot be the work of an hour, and it is only used for a few\r\ndays. At Goeree Roads I saw a place where one of these naked men had\r\nslept, which absolutely offered no more cover than the form of a hare.\r\nThe man was evidently living by himself, and York Minster said he was\r\n“very bad man,” and that probably he had stolen something. On the west\r\ncoast, however, the wigwams are rather better, for they are covered\r\nwith seal-skins. We were detained here several days by the bad weather.\r\nThe climate is certainly wretched: the summer solstice was now past,\r\nyet every day snow fell on the hills, and in the valleys there was\r\nrain, accompanied by sleet. The thermometer generally stood about 45°,\r\nbut in the night fell to 38° or 40°. From the damp and boisterous state\r\nof the atmosphere, not cheered by a gleam of sunshine, one fancied the\r\nclimate even worse than it really was.\r\n\r\nWhile going one day on shore near Wollaston Island, we\r\npulled alongside a canoe with six Fuegians. These were the most abject\r\nand miserable creatures I anywhere beheld. On the east coast the\r\nnatives, as we have seen, have guanaco cloaks, and on the west they\r\npossess seal-skins. Amongst these central tribes the men generally have\r\nan otter-skin, or some small scrap about as large as a\r\npocket-handkerchief, which is barely sufficient to cover their backs as\r\nlow down as their loins. It is laced across the breast by strings, and\r\naccording as the wind blows, it is shifted from side to side. But these\r\nFuegians in the canoe were quite naked, and even one full-grown woman\r\nwas absolutely so. It was raining heavily, and the fresh water,\r\ntogether with the spray, trickled down her body. In another harbour not\r\nfar distant, a woman, who was suckling a recently-born child, came one\r\nday alongside the vessel, and remained there out of mere curiosity,\r\nwhilst the sleet fell and thawed on her naked bosom, and on the skin of\r\nher naked baby! These poor wretches were stunted in their growth, their\r\nhideous faces bedaubed with white paint, their skins filthy and greasy,\r\ntheir hair entangled, their voices discordant, and their gestures\r\nviolent. Viewing such men, one can hardly make oneself believe that\r\nthey are fellow-creatures, and inhabitants of the same world. It is a\r\ncommon subject of conjecture what pleasure in life some of the lower\r\nanimals can enjoy: how much more reasonably the same question may be\r\nasked with respect to these barbarians! At night five or six human\r\nbeings, naked and scarcely protected from the wind and rain of this\r\ntempestuous climate, sleep on the wet ground coiled up like animals.\r\nWhenever it is low water, winter or summer, night or day, they must\r\nrise to pick shellfish from the rocks; and the women either dive to\r\ncollect sea-eggs, or sit patiently in their canoes, and with a baited\r\nhair-line without any hook, jerk out little fish. If a seal is killed,\r\nor the floating carcass of a putrid whale is discovered, it is a feast;\r\nand such miserable food is assisted by a few tasteless berries and\r\nfungi.\r\n\r\nThey often suffer from famine: I heard Mr. Low, a sealing-master\r\nintimately acquainted with the natives of this country, give a curious\r\naccount of the state of a party of one hundred and fifty natives on the\r\nwest coast, who were very thin and in great distress. A succession of\r\ngales prevented the women from getting shell-fish on the rocks, and\r\nthey could not go out in\r\ntheir canoes to catch seal. A small party of these men one morning set\r\nout, and the other Indians explained to him that they were going a four\r\ndays’ journey for food: on their return, Low went to meet them, and he\r\nfound them excessively tired, each man carrying a great square piece of\r\nputrid whales-blubber with a hole in the middle, through which they put\r\ntheir heads, like the Gauchos do through their ponchos or cloaks. As\r\nsoon as the blubber was brought into a wigwam, an old man cut off thin\r\nslices, and muttering over them, broiled them for a minute, and\r\ndistributed them to the famished party, who during this time preserved\r\na profound silence. Mr. Low believes that whenever a whale is cast on\r\nshore, the natives bury large pieces of it in the sand, as a resource\r\nin time of famine; and a native boy, whom he had on board, once found a\r\nstock thus buried. The different tribes when at war are cannibals. From\r\nthe concurrent, but quite independent evidence of the boy taken by Mr.\r\nLow, and of Jemmy Button, it is certainly true, that when pressed in\r\nwinter by hunger they kill and devour their old women before they kill\r\ntheir dogs: the boy, being asked by Mr. Low why they did this,\r\nanswered, “Doggies catch otters, old women no.” This boy described the\r\nmanner in which they are killed by being held over smoke and thus\r\nchoked; he imitated their screams as a joke, and described the parts of\r\ntheir bodies which are considered best to eat. Horrid as such a death\r\nby the hands of their friends and relatives must be, the fears of the\r\nold women, when hunger begins to press, are more painful to think of;\r\nwe were told that they then often run away into the mountains, but that\r\nthey are pursued by the men and brought back to the slaughter-house at\r\ntheir own firesides!\r\n\r\nCaptain Fitz Roy could never ascertain that the Fuegians have any\r\ndistinct belief in a future life. They sometimes bury their dead in\r\ncaves, and sometimes in the mountain forests; we do not know what\r\nceremonies they perform. Jemmy Button would not eat land-birds, because\r\n“eat dead men”; they are unwilling even to mention their dead friends.\r\nWe have no reason to believe that they perform any sort of religious\r\nworship; though perhaps the muttering of the old man before he\r\ndistributed the putrid blubber to his famished party may be of this\r\nnature. Each family or tribe has a wizard or conjuring doctor, whose\r\noffice we could never clearly ascertain. Jemmy believed in dreams,\r\nthough not, as I have said, in the devil: I do not think that our\r\nFuegians were much more superstitious than some of the sailors; for an\r\nold quartermaster firmly believed that the successive heavy gales,\r\nwhich we encountered off Cape Horn, were caused by our having the\r\nFuegians on board. The nearest approach to a religious feeling which I\r\nheard of, was shown by York Minster, who, when Mr. Bynoe shot some very\r\nyoung ducklings as specimens, declared in the most solemn manner, “Oh,\r\nMr. Bynoe, much rain, snow, blow much.” This was evidently a\r\nretributive punishment for wasting human food. In a wild and excited\r\nmanner he also related that his brother one day, whilst returning to\r\npick up some dead birds which he had left on the coast, observed some\r\nfeathers blown by the wind. His brother said (York imitating his\r\nmanner), “What that?” and crawling onwards, he peeped over the cliff,\r\nand saw “wild man” picking his birds; he crawled a little nearer, and\r\nthen hurled down a great stone and killed him. York declared for a long\r\ntime afterwards storms raged, and much rain and snow fell. As far as we\r\ncould make out, he seemed to consider the elements themselves as the\r\navenging agents: it is evident in this case, how naturally, in a race a\r\nlittle more advanced in culture, the elements would become personified.\r\nWhat the “bad wild men” were, has always appeared to me most\r\nmysterious: from what York said, when we found the place like the form\r\nof a hare, where a single man had slept the night before, I should have\r\nthought that they were thieves who had been driven from their tribes;\r\nbut other obscure speeches made me doubt this; I have sometimes\r\nimagined that the most probable explanation was that they were insane.\r\n\r\nThe different tribes have no government or chief; yet each is\r\nsurrounded by other hostile tribes, speaking different dialects, and\r\nseparated from each other only by a deserted border or neutral\r\nterritory: the cause of their warfare appears to be the means of\r\nsubsistence. Their country is a broken mass of wild rocks, lofty hills,\r\nand useless forests: and these are viewed through mists and endless\r\nstorms. The habitable land is reduced to the stones on the beach; in\r\nsearch of food they are compelled unceasingly to wander from spot to\r\nspot, and so steep is the coast, that they can only move about in their\r\nwretched canoes. They cannot know the feeling of having a home, and\r\nstill less that of domestic affection; for the husband is to the wife a\r\nbrutal master to a laborious slave. Was a more horrid deed ever\r\nperpetrated, than that witnessed on the west coast by Byron, who saw a\r\nwretched mother pick up her bleeding dying infant-boy, whom her husband\r\nhad mercilessly dashed on the stones for dropping a basket of sea-eggs!\r\nHow little can the higher powers of the mind be brought into play: what\r\nis there for imagination to picture, for reason to compare, for\r\njudgment to decide upon? to knock a limpet from the rock does not\r\nrequire even cunning, that lowest power of the mind. Their skill in\r\nsome respects may be compared to the instinct of animals; for it is not\r\nimproved by experience: the canoe, their most ingenious work, poor as\r\nit is, has remained the same, as we know from Drake, for the last two\r\nhundred and fifty years.\r\n\r\nWhilst beholding these savages, one asks, Whence have they come? What\r\ncould have tempted, or what change compelled, a tribe of men, to leave\r\nthe fine regions of the north, to travel down the Cordillera or\r\nbackbone of America, to invent and build canoes, which are not used by\r\nthe tribes of Chile, Peru, and Brazil, and then to enter on one of the\r\nmost inhospitable countries within the limits of the globe? Although\r\nsuch reflections must at first seize on the mind, yet we may feel sure\r\nthat they are partly erroneous. There is no reason to believe that the\r\nFuegians decrease in number; therefore we must suppose that they enjoy\r\na sufficient share of happiness, of whatever kind it may be, to render\r\nlife worth having. Nature by making habit omnipotent, and its effects\r\nhereditary, has fitted the Fuegian to the climate and the productions\r\nof his miserable country.\r\n\r\nBad weather, Magellan Straits\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter having been detained six days in Wigwam Cove by very bad weather,\r\nwe put to sea on the 30th of December. Captain Fitz Roy wished to get\r\nwestward to land York and Fuegia in their own country. When at sea we\r\nhad a constant succession of gales, and the current was against us: we\r\ndrifted to 57° 23′ south. On the 11th of January, 1833, by carrying a\r\npress of sail, we fetched within a few miles of the great rugged\r\nmountain of York Minster (so called by Captain Cook, and the origin of\r\nthe name of the elder Fuegian), when a violent squall\r\ncompelled us to shorten sail and stand out to sea. The surf was\r\nbreaking fearfully on the coast, and the spray was carried over a cliff\r\nestimated at 200 feet in height. On the 12th the gale was very heavy,\r\nand we did not know exactly where we were: it was a most unpleasant\r\nsound to hear constantly repeated, “Keep a good lookout to leeward.” On\r\nthe 13th the storm raged with its full fury: our horizon was narrowly\r\nlimited by the sheets of spray borne by the wind. The sea looked\r\nominous, like a dreary waving plain with patches of drifted snow:\r\nwhilst the ship laboured heavily, the albatross glided with its\r\nexpanded wings right up the wind. At noon a great sea broke over us,\r\nand filled one of the whale-boats, which was obliged to be instantly\r\ncut away. The poor _Beagle_ trembled at the shock, and for a few\r\nminutes would not obey her helm; but soon, like a good ship that she\r\nwas, she righted and came up to the wind again. Had another sea\r\nfollowed the first, our fate would have been decided soon, and for\r\never. We had now been twenty-four days trying in vain to get westward;\r\nthe men were worn out with fatigue, and they had not had for many\r\nnights or days a dry thing to put on. Captain Fitz Roy gave up the\r\nattempt to get westward by the outside coast. In the evening we ran in\r\nbehind False Cape Horn, and\r\ndropped our anchor in forty-seven fathoms, fire flashing from the\r\nwindlass as the chain rushed round it. How delightful was that still\r\nnight, after having been so long involved in the din of the warring\r\nelements!\r\n\r\nFuegian basket and bone weapons\r\n\r\n_January_ 15, 1833.—The _Beagle_ anchored in Goeree Roads. Captain Fitz\r\nRoy having resolved to settle the Fuegians, according to their wishes,\r\nin Ponsonby Sound, four boats were equipped to carry them there through\r\nthe Beagle Channel. This channel, which was discovered by Captain Fitz\r\nRoy during the last voyage, is a most remarkable feature in the\r\ngeography of this, or indeed of any other country: it may be compared\r\nto the valley of Loch Ness in Scotland, with its chain of lakes and\r\nfriths. It is about one hundred and twenty miles long, with an average\r\nbreadth, not subject to any very great variation, of about two miles;\r\nand is throughout the greater part so perfectly straight, that the\r\nview, bounded on each side by a line of mountains, gradually becomes\r\nindistinct in the long distance. It crosses the southern part of Tierra\r\ndel Fuego in an east and west line, and in the middle is joined at\r\nright angles on the south side by an irregular channel, which has been\r\ncalled Ponsonby Sound. This is the residence of Jemmy Button’s tribe\r\nand family.\r\n\r\n19_th._—Three whale-boats and the yawl, with a party of\r\ntwenty-eight, started under the command of Captain Fitz Roy. In the\r\nafternoon we entered the eastern mouth of the channel, and shortly\r\nafterwards found a snug little cove concealed by some surrounding\r\nislets. Here we pitched our tents and lighted our fires. Nothing could\r\nlook more comfortable than this scene. The glassy water of the little\r\nharbour, with the branches of the trees hanging over the rocky beach,\r\nthe boats at anchor, the tents supported by the crossed oars, and the\r\nsmoke curling up the wooded valley, formed a picture of quiet\r\nretirement. The next day (20th) we smoothly glided onwards in our\r\nlittle fleet, and came to a more inhabited district. Few if any of\r\nthese natives could ever have seen a white man; certainly nothing could\r\nexceed their astonishment at the apparition of the four boats. Fires\r\nwere lighted on every point (hence the name of Tierra del Fuego, or the\r\nland of fire), both to attract our attention and to spread far and wide\r\nthe news. Some of the men ran for miles along the shore. I shall never\r\nforget how wild and savage one group appeared: suddenly four or five\r\nmen came to the edge of an overhanging cliff; they were absolutely\r\nnaked, and their long hair streamed about their faces; they held rugged\r\nstaffs in their hands, and, springing from the ground, they waved their\r\narms round their heads, and sent forth the most hideous yells.\r\n\r\nAt dinner-time we landed among a party of Fuegians. At first they were\r\nnot inclined to be friendly; for until the Captain pulled in ahead of\r\nthe other boats, they kept their slings in their hands. We soon,\r\nhowever, delighted them by trifling presents, such as tying red tape\r\nround their heads. They liked our biscuit: but one of the savages\r\ntouched with his finger some of the meat preserved in tin cases which I\r\nwas eating, and feeling it soft and cold, showed as much disgust at it,\r\nas I should have done at putrid blubber. Jemmy was thoroughly ashamed\r\nof his countrymen, and declared his own tribe were quite different, in\r\nwhich he was woefully mistaken. It was as easy to please as it was\r\ndifficult to satisfy these savages. Young and old, men and children,\r\nnever ceased repeating the word “yammerschooner,” which means “give\r\nme.” After pointing to almost every object, one after the other, even\r\nto the buttons on our coats, and saying their favourite word in as many\r\nintonations as possible, they would then use it in a neuter sense, and\r\nvacantly repeat “yammerschooner.” After yammerschoonering for any\r\narticle very\r\neagerly, they would by a simple artifice point to their young women or\r\nlittle children, as much as to say, “If you will not give it me, surely\r\nyou will to such as these.”\r\n\r\nAt night we endeavoured in vain to find an uninhabited cove; and at\r\nlast were obliged to bivouac not far from a party of natives. They were\r\nvery inoffensive as long as they were few in numbers, but in the\r\nmorning (21st) being joined by others they showed symptoms of\r\nhostility, and we thought that we should have come to a skirmish. An\r\nEuropean labours under great disadvantages when treating with savages\r\nlike these who have not the least idea of the power of firearms. In the\r\nvery act of levelling his musket he appears to the savage far inferior\r\nto a man armed with a bow and arrow, a spear, or even a sling. Nor is\r\nit easy to teach them our superiority except by striking a fatal blow.\r\nLike wild beasts, they do not appear to compare numbers; for each\r\nindividual, if attacked, instead of retiring, will endeavour to dash\r\nyour brains out with a stone, as certainly as a tiger under similar\r\ncircumstances would tear you. Captain Fitz Roy, on one occasion being\r\nvery anxious, from good reasons, to frighten away a small party, first\r\nflourished a cutlass near them, at which they only laughed; he then\r\ntwice fired his pistol close to a native. The man both times looked\r\nastounded, and carefully but quickly rubbed his head; he then stared\r\nawhile, and gabbled to his companions, but he never seemed to think of\r\nrunning away. We can hardly put ourselves in the position of these\r\nsavages, and understand their actions. In the case of this Fuegian, the\r\npossibility of such a sound as the report of a gun close to his ear\r\ncould never have entered his mind. He perhaps literally did not for a\r\nsecond know whether it was a sound or a blow, and therefore very\r\nnaturally rubbed his head. In a similar manner, when a savage sees a\r\nmark struck by a bullet, it may be some time before he is able at all\r\nto understand how it is effected; for the fact of a body being\r\ninvisible from its velocity would perhaps be to him an idea totally\r\ninconceivable. Moreover, the extreme force of a bullet that penetrates\r\na hard substance without tearing it, may convince the savage that it\r\nhas no force at all. Certainly I believe that many savages of the\r\nlowest grade, such as these of Tierra del Fuego, have seen objects\r\nstruck, and even small animals killed by the musket,\r\nwithout being in the least aware how deadly an instrument it is.\r\n\r\n22_nd._—After having passed an unmolested night, in what would appear\r\nto be neutral territory between Jemmy’s tribe and the people whom we\r\nsaw yesterday, we sailed pleasantly along. I do not know anything which\r\nshows more clearly the hostile state of the different tribes, than\r\nthese wide border or neutral tracts. Although Jemmy Button well knew\r\nthe force of our party, he was, at first, unwilling to land amidst the\r\nhostile tribe nearest to his own. He often told us how the savage Oens\r\nmen “when the leaf red,” crossed the mountains from the eastern coast\r\nof Tierra del Fuego, and made inroads on the natives of this part of\r\nthe country. It was most curious to watch him when thus talking, and\r\nsee his eyes gleaming and his whole face assume a new and wild\r\nexpression. As we proceeded along the Beagle Channel, the scenery\r\nassumed a peculiar and very magnificent character; but the effect was\r\nmuch lessened from the lowness of the point of view in a boat, and from\r\nlooking along the valley, and thus losing all the beauty of a\r\nsuccession of ridges. The mountains were here about three thousand feet\r\nhigh, and terminated in sharp and jagged points. They rose in one\r\nunbroken sweep from the water’s edge, and were covered to the height of\r\nfourteen or fifteen hundred feet by the dusky-coloured forest. It was\r\nmost curious to observe, as far as the eye could range, how level and\r\ntruly horizontal the line on the mountain side was, at which trees\r\nceased to grow: it precisely resembled the high-water mark of driftweed\r\non a sea-beach.\r\n\r\nAt night we slept close to the junction of Ponsonby Sound with the\r\nBeagle Channel. A small family of Fuegians, who were living in the\r\ncove, were quiet and inoffensive, and soon joined our party round a\r\nblazing fire. We were well clothed, and though sitting close to the\r\nfire were far from too warm; yet these naked savages, though farther\r\noff, were observed, to our great surprise, to be streaming with\r\nperspiration at undergoing such a roasting. They seemed, however, very\r\nwell pleased, and all joined in the chorus of the seamen’s songs: but\r\nthe manner in which they were invariably a little behindhand was quite\r\nludicrous.\r\n\r\nDuring the night the news had spread, and early in the\r\nmorning (23rd) a fresh party arrived, belonging to the Tekenika, or\r\nJemmy’s tribe. Several of them had run so fast that their noses were\r\nbleeding, and their mouths frothed from the rapidity with which they\r\ntalked; and with their naked bodies all bedaubed with black, white,[1]\r\nand red, they looked like so many demoniacs who had been fighting. We\r\nthen proceeded (accompanied by twelve canoes, each holding four or five\r\npeople) down Ponsonby Sound to the spot where poor Jemmy expected to\r\nfind his mother and relatives. He had already heard that his father was\r\ndead; but as he had had a “dream in his head” to that effect, he did\r\nnot seem to care much about it, and repeatedly comforted himself with\r\nthe very natural reflection—“Me no help it.” He was not able to learn\r\nany particulars regarding his father’s death, as his relations would\r\nnot speak about it.\r\n\r\n [1] This substance, when dry, is tolerably compact, and of little\r\n specific gravity: Professor Ehrenberg has examined it: he states\r\n (_König Akad. der Wissen:_ Berlin, Feb. 1845) that it is composed of\r\n infusoria, including fourteen polygastrica and four phytolitharia. He\r\n says that they are all inhabitants of fresh water; this is a beautiful\r\n example of the results obtainable through Professor Ehrenberg’s\r\n microscopic researches; for Jemmy Button told me that it is always\r\n collected at the bottoms of mountain-brooks. It is, moreover, a\r\n striking fact in the geographical distribution of the infusoria, which\r\n are well known to have very wide ranges, that all the species in this\r\n substance, although brought from the extreme southern point of Tierra\r\n del Fuego, are old, known forms.\r\n\r\nJemmy was now in a district well known to him, and guided the boats to\r\na quiet pretty cove named Woollya, surrounded by islets, every one of\r\nwhich and every point had its proper native name. We found here a\r\nfamily of Jemmy’s tribe, but not his relations: we made friends with\r\nthem; and in the evening they sent a canoe to inform Jemmy’s mother and\r\nbrothers. The cove was bordered by some acres of good sloping land, not\r\ncovered (as elsewhere) either by peat or by forest-trees. Captain Fitz\r\nRoy originally intended, as before stated, to have taken York Minster\r\nand Fuegia to their own tribe on the west coast; but as they expressed\r\na wish to remain here, and as the spot was singularly favourable,\r\nCaptain Fitz Roy determined to settle here the whole party, including\r\nMatthews, the missionary. Five days were spent in building for them\r\nthree large wigwams, in landing their goods, in digging two gardens,\r\nand sowing seeds.\r\n\r\nThe next morning after our arrival (the 24th) the Fuegians\r\nbegan to pour in, and Jemmy’s mother and brothers arrived. Jemmy\r\nrecognised the stentorian voice of one of his brothers at a prodigious\r\ndistance. The meeting was less interesting than that between a horse,\r\nturned out into a field, when he joins an old companion. There was no\r\ndemonstration of affection; they simply stared for a short time at each\r\nother; and the mother immediately went to look after her canoe. We\r\nheard, however, through York that the mother had been inconsolable for\r\nthe loss of Jemmy, and had searched everywhere for him, thinking that\r\nhe might have been left after having been taken in the boat. The women\r\ntook much notice of and were very kind to Fuegia. We had already\r\nperceived that Jemmy had almost forgotten his own language. I should\r\nthink there was scarcely another human being with so small a stock of\r\nlanguage, for his English was very imperfect. It was laughable, but\r\nalmost pitiable, to hear him speak to his wild brother in English, and\r\nthen ask him in Spanish (“no sabe?”) whether he did not understand him.\r\n\r\nEverything went on peaceably during the three next days, whilst the\r\ngardens were digging and wigwams building. We estimated the number of\r\nnatives at about one hundred and twenty. The women worked hard, whilst\r\nthe men lounged about all day long, watching us. They asked for\r\neverything they saw, and stole what they could. They were delighted at\r\nour dancing and singing, and were particularly interested at seeing us\r\nwash in a neighbouring brook; they did not pay much attention to\r\nanything else, not even to our boats. Of all the things which York saw,\r\nduring his absence from his country, nothing seems more to have\r\nastonished him than an ostrich, near Maldonado: breathless with\r\nastonishment he came running to Mr. Bynoe, with whom he was out\r\nwalking—“Oh, Mr. Bynoe, oh, bird all same horse!” Much as our white\r\nskins surprised the natives, by Mr. Low’s account a negro-cook to a\r\nsealing vessel did so more effectually, and the poor fellow was so\r\nmobbed and shouted at that he would never go on shore again. Everything\r\nwent on so quietly, that some of the officers and myself took long\r\nwalks in the surrounding hills and woods. Suddenly, however, on the\r\n27th, every woman and child disappeared. We were all uneasy at this, as\r\nneither York nor Jemmy could make out the cause. It was thought by some\r\nthat they had been frightened by our cleaning and firing off our\r\nmuskets on the previous evening: by others, that it was owing to\r\noffence taken by an old savage, who, when told to keep farther off, had\r\ncoolly spit in the sentry’s face, and had then, by gestures acted over\r\na sleeping Fuegian, plainly showed, as it was said, that he should like\r\nto cut up and eat our man. Captain Fitz Roy, to avoid the chance of an\r\nencounter, which would have been fatal to so many of the Fuegians,\r\nthought it advisable for us to sleep at a cove a few miles distant.\r\nMatthews, with his usual quiet fortitude (remarkable in a man\r\napparently possessing little energy of character), determined to stay\r\nwith the Fuegians, who evinced no alarm for themselves; and so we left\r\nthem to pass their first awful night.\r\n\r\nOn our return in the morning (28th) we were delighted to find all\r\nquiet, and the men employed in their canoes spearing fish. Captain Fitz\r\nRoy determined to send the yawl and one whale-boat back to the ship;\r\nand to proceed with the two other boats, one under his own command (in\r\nwhich he most kindly allowed me to accompany him), and one under Mr.\r\nHammond, to survey the western parts of the Beagle Channel, and\r\nafterwards to return and visit the settlement. The day to our\r\nastonishment was overpoweringly hot, so that our skins were scorched;\r\nwith this beautiful weather, the view in the middle of the Beagle\r\nChannel was very remarkable. Looking towards either hand, no object\r\nintercepted the vanishing points of this long canal between the\r\nmountains. The circumstance of its being an arm of the sea was rendered\r\nvery evident by several huge whales[2] spouting in different\r\ndirections. On one occasion I saw two of these monsters, probably male\r\nand female, slowly swimming one after the other, within less than a\r\nstone’s throw of the shore, over which the beech-tree extended its\r\nbranches.\r\n\r\n [2] One day, off the East coast of Tierra del Fuego, we saw a grand\r\n sight in several spermaceti whales jumping upright quite out of the\r\n water, with the exception of their tail-fins. As they fell down\r\n sideways, they splashed the water high up, and the sound reverberated\r\n like a distant broadside.\r\n\r\nWe sailed on till it was dark, and then pitched our tents in a quiet\r\ncreek. The greatest luxury was to find for our beds a beach of pebbles,\r\nfor they were dry and yielded to the body. Peaty soil is damp; rock is\r\nuneven and hard; sand gets into one’s meat, when cooked and eaten\r\nboat-fashion; but when lying\r\nin our blanket-bags, on a good bed of smooth pebbles, we passed most\r\ncomfortable nights.\r\n\r\nIt was my watch till one o’clock. There is something very solemn in\r\nthese scenes. At no time does the consciousness in what a remote corner\r\nof the world you are then standing come so strongly before the mind.\r\nEverything tends to this effect; the stillness of the night is\r\ninterrupted only by the heavy breathing of the seamen beneath the\r\ntents, and sometimes by the cry of a night-bird. The occasional barking\r\nof a dog, heard in the distance, reminds one that it is the land of the\r\nsavage.\r\n\r\n_January_ 29_th._—Early in the morning we arrived at the point where\r\nthe Beagle Channel divides into two arms; and we entered the northern\r\none. The scenery here becomes even grander than before. The lofty\r\nmountains on the north side compose the granitic axis, or backbone of\r\nthe country, and boldly rise to a height of between three and four\r\nthousand feet, with one peak above six thousand feet. They are covered\r\nby a wide mantle of perpetual snow, and numerous cascades pour their\r\nwaters, through the woods, into the narrow channel below. In many\r\nparts, magnificent glaciers extend from the mountain side to the\r\nwater’s edge. It is scarcely possible to imagine anything more\r\nbeautiful than the beryl-like blue of these glaciers, and especially as\r\ncontrasted with the dead white of the upper expanse of snow. The\r\nfragments which had fallen from the glacier into the water were\r\nfloating away, and the channel with its icebergs presented, for the\r\nspace of a mile, a miniature likeness of the Polar Sea. The boats being\r\nhauled on shore at our dinner-hour, we were admiring from the distance\r\nof half a mile a perpendicular cliff of ice, and were wishing that some\r\nmore fragments would fall. At last, down came a mass with a roaring\r\nnoise, and immediately we saw the smooth outline of a wave travelling\r\ntowards us. The men ran down as quickly as they could to the boats; for\r\nthe chance of their being dashed to pieces was evident. One of the\r\nseamen just caught hold of the bows, as the curling breaker reached it:\r\nhe was knocked over and over, but not hurt, and the boats, though\r\nthrice lifted on high and let fall again, received no damage. This was\r\nmost fortunate for us, for we were a hundred miles distant from the\r\nship, and we should have been left without provisions or firearms. I\r\nhad previously observed that some large fragments of rock on the beach\r\nhad been lately displaced;\r\nbut until seeing this wave I did not understand the cause. One side of\r\nthe creek was formed by a spur of mica-slate; the head by a cliff of\r\nice about forty feet high; and the other side by a promontory fifty\r\nfeet high, built up of huge rounded fragments of granite and\r\nmica-slate, out of which old trees were growing. This promontory was\r\nevidently a moraine, heaped up at a period when the glacier had greater\r\ndimensions.\r\n\r\nWhen we reached the western mouth of this northern branch of the Beagle\r\nChannel, we sailed amongst many unknown desolate islands, and the\r\nweather was wretchedly bad. We met with no natives. The coast was\r\nalmost everywhere so steep that we had several times to pull many miles\r\nbefore we could find space enough to pitch our two tents: one night we\r\nslept on large round boulders, with putrefying sea-weed between them;\r\nand when the tide rose, we had to get up and move our blanket-bags. The\r\nfarthest point westward which we reached was Stewart Island, a distance\r\nof about one hundred and fifty miles from our ship. We returned into\r\nthe Beagle Channel by the southern arm, and thence proceeded, with no\r\nadventure, back to Ponsonby Sound.\r\n\r\n_February_ 6_th._—We arrived at Woollya. Matthews gave so bad an\r\naccount of the conduct of the Fuegians, that Captain Fitz Roy\r\ndetermined to take him back to the _Beagle_; and ultimately he was left\r\nat New Zealand, where his brother was a missionary. From the time of\r\nour leaving, a regular system of plunder commenced; fresh parties of\r\nthe natives kept arriving: York and Jemmy lost many things, and\r\nMatthews almost everything which had not been concealed underground.\r\nEvery article seemed to have been torn up and divided by the natives.\r\nMatthews described the watch he was obliged always to keep as most\r\nharassing; night and day he was surrounded by the natives, who tried to\r\ntire him out by making an incessant noise close to his head. One day an\r\nold man, whom Matthews asked to leave his wigwam, immediately returned\r\nwith a large stone in his hand: another day a whole party came armed\r\nwith stones and stakes, and some of the younger men and Jemmy’s brother\r\nwere crying: Matthews met them with presents. Another party showed by\r\nsigns that they wished to strip him naked and pluck all the hairs out\r\nof his face and body. I think we arrived just in time to save his life.\r\nJemmy’s relatives had been so vain and foolish, that they had showed to\r\nstrangers their plunder, and their manner\r\nof obtaining it. It was quite melancholy leaving the three Fuegians\r\nwith their savage countrymen; but it was a great comfort that they had\r\nno personal fears. York, being a powerful resolute man, was pretty sure\r\nto get on well, together with his wife Fuegia. Poor Jemmy looked rather\r\ndisconsolate, and would then, I have little doubt, have been glad to\r\nhave returned with us. His own brother had stolen many things from him;\r\nand as he remarked, “What fashion call that:” he abused his countrymen,\r\n“all bad men, no sabe (know) nothing” and, though I never heard him\r\nswear before, “damned fools.” Our three Fuegians, though they had been\r\nonly three years with civilised men, would, I am sure, have been glad\r\nto have retained their new habits; but this was obviously impossible. I\r\nfear it is more than doubtful whether their visit will have been of any\r\nuse to them.\r\n\r\nIn the evening, with Matthews on board, we made sail back to the ship,\r\nnot by the Beagle Channel, but by the southern coast. The boats were\r\nheavily laden and the sea rough, and we had a dangerous passage. By the\r\nevening of the 7th we were on board the _ Beagle_ after an absence of\r\ntwenty days, during which time we had gone three hundred miles in the\r\nopen boats. On the 11th Captain Fitz Roy paid a visit by himself to the\r\nFuegians and found them going on well; and that they had lost very few\r\nmore things.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the last day of February in the succeeding year (1834) the _Beagle_\r\nanchored in a beautiful little cove at the eastern entrance of the\r\nBeagle Channel. Captain Fitz Roy determined on the bold, and as it\r\nproved successful, attempt to beat against the westerly winds by the\r\nsame route which we had followed in the boats to the settlement at\r\nWoollya. We did not see many natives until we were near Ponsonby Sound,\r\nwhere we were followed by ten or twelve canoes. The natives did not at\r\nall understand the reason of our tacking, and, instead of meeting us at\r\neach tack, vainly strove to follow us in our zigzag course. I was\r\namused at finding what a difference the circumstance of being quite\r\nsuperior in force made, in the interest of beholding these savages.\r\nWhile in the boats I got to hate the very sound of their voices, so\r\nmuch trouble did they give us. The first and last word was\r\n“yammerschooner.” When, entering some quiet little cove, we have looked\r\nround and thought to pass a quiet\r\nnight, the odious word “yammerschooner” has shrilly sounded from some\r\ngloomy nook, and then the little signal-smoke has curled up to spread\r\nthe news far and wide. On leaving some place we have said to each\r\nother, “Thank heaven, we have at last fairly left these wretches!” when\r\none more faint halloo from an all-powerful voice, heard at a prodigious\r\ndistance, would reach our ears, and clearly could we\r\ndistinguish—“yammerschooner.” But now, the more Fuegians the merrier;\r\nand very merry work it was. Both parties laughing, wondering, gaping at\r\neach other; we pitying them, for giving us good fish and crabs for\r\nrags, etc.; they grasping at the chance of finding people so foolish as\r\nto exchange such splendid ornaments for a good supper. It was most\r\namusing to see the undisguised smile of satisfaction with which one\r\nyoung woman with her face painted black, tied several bits of scarlet\r\ncloth round her head with rushes. Her husband, who enjoyed the very\r\nuniversal privilege in this country of possessing two wives, evidently\r\nbecame jealous of all the attention paid to his young wife; and, after\r\na consultation with his naked beauties, was paddled away by them.\r\n\r\nSome of the Fuegians plainly showed that they had a fair notion of\r\nbarter. I gave one man a large nail (a most valuable present) without\r\nmaking any signs for a return; but he immediately picked out two fish,\r\nand handed them up on the point of his spear. If any present was\r\ndesigned for one canoe, and it fell near another, it was invariably\r\ngiven to the right owner. The Fuegian boy, whom Mr. Low had on board,\r\nshowed, by going into the most violent passion, that he quite\r\nunderstood the reproach of being called a liar, which in truth he was.\r\nWe were this time, as on all former occasions, much surprised at the\r\nlittle notice, or rather none whatever, which was taken of many things,\r\nthe use of which must have been evident to the natives. Simple\r\ncircumstances—such as the beauty of scarlet cloth or blue beads, the\r\nabsence of women, our care in washing ourselves,—excited their\r\nadmiration far more than any grand or complicated object, such as our\r\nship. Bougainville has well remarked concerning these people, that they\r\ntreat the “chefs d’œuvres de l’industrie humaine, comme ils traitent\r\nles loix de la nature et ses phénomènes.”\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of March we anchored in a cove at Woollya,\r\nbut we saw not a soul there. We were alarmed at this, for the natives\r\nin Ponsonby Sound showed by gestures that there had been fighting; and\r\nwe afterwards heard that the dreaded Oens men had made a descent. Soon\r\na canoe, with a little flag flying, was seen approaching, with one of\r\nthe men in it washing the paint off his face. This man was poor\r\nJemmy,—now a thin, haggard savage, with long disordered hair, and\r\nnaked, except a bit of blanket round his waist. We did not recognize\r\nhim till he was close to us, for he was ashamed of himself, and turned\r\nhis back to the ship. We had left him plump, fat, clean, and\r\nwell-dressed;—I never saw so complete and grievous a change. As soon\r\nhowever as he was clothed, and the first flurry was over, things wore a\r\ngood appearance. He dined with Captain Fitz Roy, and ate his dinner as\r\ntidily as formerly. He told us that he had “too much” (meaning enough)\r\nto eat, that he was not cold, that his relations were very good people,\r\nand that he did not wish to go back to England: in the evening we found\r\nout the cause of this great change in Jemmy’s feelings, in the arrival\r\nof his young and nice-looking wife. With his usual good feeling, he\r\nbrought two beautiful otter-skins for two of his best friends, and some\r\nspear-heads and arrows made with his own hands for the Captain. He said\r\nhe had built a canoe for himself, and he boasted that he could talk a\r\nlittle of his own language! But it is a most singular fact, that he\r\nappears to have taught all his tribe some English: an old man\r\nspontaneously announced “Jemmy Button’s wife.” Jemmy had lost all his\r\nproperty. He told us that York Minster had built a large canoe, and\r\nwith his wife Fuegia,[3] had several months since gone to his own\r\ncountry, and had taken farewell by an act of consummate villainy; he\r\npersuaded Jemmy and his mother to come with him, and then on the way\r\ndeserted them by night, stealing every article of their property.\r\n\r\n [3] Captain Sulivan, who, since his voyage in the _Beagle_, has been\r\n employed on the survey of the Falkland Islands, heard from a sealer in\r\n (1842?), that when in the western part of the Strait of Magellan, he\r\n was astonished by a native woman coming on board, who could talk some\r\n English. Without doubt this was Fuegia Basket. She lived (I fear the\r\n term probably bears a double interpretation) some days on board.\r\n\r\nJemmy went to sleep on shore, and in the morning returned, and remained\r\non board till the ship got under weigh, which frightened his wife, who\r\ncontinued crying violently till he got\r\ninto his canoe. He returned loaded with valuable property. Every soul\r\non board was heartily sorry to shake hands with him for the last time.\r\nI do not now doubt that he will be as happy as, perhaps happier than,\r\nif he had never left his own country. Every one must sincerely hope\r\nthat Captain Fitz Roy’s noble hope may be fulfilled, of being rewarded\r\nfor the many generous sacrifices which he made for these Fuegians, by\r\nsome shipwrecked sailor being protected by the descendants of Jemmy\r\nButton and his tribe! When Jemmy reached the shore, he lighted a signal\r\nfire, and the smoke curled up, bidding us a last and long farewell, as\r\nthe ship stood on her course into the open sea.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe perfect equality among the individuals composing the Fuegian tribes\r\nmust for a long time retard their civilisation. As we see those\r\nanimals, whose instinct compels them to live in society and obey a\r\nchief, are most capable of improvement, so is it with the races of\r\nmankind. Whether we look at it as a cause or a consequence, the more\r\ncivilised always have the most artificial governments. For instance,\r\nthe inhabitants of Otaheite, who, when first discovered, were governed\r\nby hereditary kings, had arrived at a far higher grade than another\r\nbranch of the same people, the New Zealanders,—who, although benefited\r\nby being compelled to turn their attention to agriculture, were\r\nrepublicans in the most absolute sense. In Tierra del Fuego, until some\r\nchief shall arise with power sufficient to secure any acquired\r\nadvantage, such as the domesticated animals, it seems scarcely possible\r\nthat the political state of the country can be improved. At present,\r\neven a piece of cloth given to one is torn into shreds and distributed;\r\nand no one individual becomes richer than another. On the other hand,\r\nit is difficult to understand how a chief can arise till there is\r\nproperty of some sort by which he might manifest his superiority and\r\nincrease his power.\r\n\r\nI believe, in this extreme part of South America, man exists in a lower\r\nstate of improvement than in any other part of the world. The South Sea\r\nIslanders, of the two races inhabiting the Pacific, are comparatively\r\ncivilised. The Esquimaux, in his subterranean hut, enjoys some of the\r\ncomforts of life, and in his canoe, when fully equipped, manifests much\r\nskill. Some of the\r\ntribes of Southern Africa, prowling about in search of roots, and\r\nliving concealed on the wild and arid plains, are sufficiently\r\nwretched. The Australian, in the simplicity of the arts of life, comes\r\nnearest the Fuegian: he can, however, boast of his boomerang, his spear\r\nand throwing-stick, his method of climbing trees, of tracking animals,\r\nand of hunting. Although the Australian may be superior in\r\nacquirements, it by no means follows that he is likewise superior in\r\nmental capacity: indeed, from what I saw of the Fuegians when on board\r\nand from what I have read of the Australians, I should think the case\r\nwas exactly the reverse.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: False Horn, Cape Horn.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Wollaston Island, Tierra del Fuego]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XI\r\n\r\n\r\nStrait of Magellan—Port Famine—Ascent of Mount Tarn—Forests—Edible\r\nfungus—Zoology—Great Seaweed—Leave Tierra del Fuego—Climate—Fruit-trees\r\nand productions of the southern coasts—Height of snow-line on the\r\nCordillera—Descent of glaciers to the sea—Icebergs formed—Transportal\r\nof boulders—Climate and productions of the Antarctic\r\nIslands—Preservation of frozen carcasses—Recapitulation.\r\n\r\nSTRAIT OF MAGELLAN.—CLIMATE OF THE SOUTHERN COASTS.\r\n\r\nIn the end of May 1834 we entered for a second time the eastern mouth\r\nof the Strait of Magellan. The country on both sides of this part of\r\nthe Strait consists of nearly level plains, like those of Patagonia.\r\nCape Negro, a little within the second Narrows, may be considered as\r\nthe point where the land begins to assume the marked features of Tierra\r\ndel Fuego. On the east coast, south of the Strait, broken park-like\r\nscenery in a like manner connects these two countries, which are\r\nopposed to each other in almost every feature. It is truly surprising\r\nto find in a space of twenty miles such a change in the landscape. If\r\nwe take a rather greater distance, as between Port Famine and\r\nGregory Bay, that is about sixty miles, the difference is still more\r\nwonderful. At the former place we have rounded mountains concealed by\r\nimpervious forests, which are drenched with the rain brought by an\r\nendless succession of gales; while at Cape Gregory there is a clear and\r\nbright blue sky over the dry and sterile plains. The atmospheric\r\ncurrents,[1] although rapid, turbulent, and unconfined by any apparent\r\nlimits, yet seem to follow, like a river in its bed, a regularly\r\ndetermined course.\r\n\r\n [1] The south-westerly breezes are generally very dry. January 29th,\r\n being at anchor under Cape Gregory: a very hard gale from west by\r\n south, clear sky with few cumuli; temperature 57°, dew-point\r\n 36°,—difference 21°. On January 15th, at Port St. Julian: in the\r\n morning light winds with much rain, followed by a very heavy squall\r\n with rain,—settled into heavy gale with large cumuli,—cleared up,\r\n blowing very strong from south-south-west. Temperature 60°, dew-point\r\n 42°,—difference 18°.\r\n\r\n\r\nPatagonians from Cape Gregory\r\n\r\nDuring our previous visit (in January), we had an interview at Cape\r\nGregory with the famous so-called gigantic Patagonians, who gave us a\r\ncordial reception. Their height appears greater than it really is, from\r\ntheir large guanaco mantles, their long flowing hair, and general\r\nfigure: on an average their height is about six feet, with some men\r\ntaller and only a few shorter; and the women are also tall; altogether\r\nthey are certainly the tallest race which we anywhere saw. In features\r\nthey strikingly\r\nresemble the more northern Indians whom I saw with Rosas, but they have\r\na wilder and more formidable appearance: their faces were much painted\r\nwith red and black, and one man was ringed and dotted with white like a\r\nFuegian. Captain Fitz Roy offered to take any three of them on board,\r\nand all seemed determined to be of the three. It was long before we\r\ncould clear the boat; at last we got on board with our three giants,\r\nwho dined with the Captain, and behaved quite like gentlemen, helping\r\nthemselves with knives, forks, and spoons: nothing was so much relished\r\nas sugar. This tribe has had so much communication with sealers and\r\nwhalers, that most of the men can speak a little English and Spanish;\r\nand they are half civilised, and proportionally demoralised.\r\n\r\nPort Famine, Magellan\r\n\r\nThe next morning a large party went on shore, to barter for skins and\r\nostrich-feathers; fire-arms being refused, tobacco was in greatest\r\nrequest, far more so than axes or tools. The whole population of the\r\ntoldos, men, women, and children, were arranged on a bank. It was an\r\namusing scene, and it was impossible not to\r\nlike the so-called giants, they were so thoroughly good-humoured and\r\nunsuspecting: they asked us to come again. They seem to like to have\r\nEuropeans to live with them; and old Maria, an important woman in the\r\ntribe, once begged Mr. Low to leave any one of his sailors with them.\r\nThey spend the greater part of the year here; but in summer they hunt\r\nalong the foot of the Cordillera: sometimes they travel as far as the\r\nRio Negro, 750 miles to the north. They are well stocked with horses,\r\neach man having, according to Mr. Low, six or seven, and all the women,\r\nand even children, their one own horse. In the time of Sarmiento (1580)\r\nthese Indians had bows and arrows, now long since disused; they then\r\nalso possessed some horses. This is a very curious fact, showing the\r\nextraordinarily rapid multiplication of horses in South America. The\r\nhorse was first landed at Buenos Ayres in 1537, and the colony being\r\nthen for a time deserted, the horse ran wild;[2] in 1580, only\r\nforty-three years afterwards, we hear of them at the Strait of\r\nMagellan! Mr. Low informs me, that a neighbouring tribe of foot-Indians\r\nis now changing into horse-Indians: the tribe at Gregory Bay giving\r\nthem their worn-out horses, and sending in winter a few of their best\r\nskilled men to hunt for them.\r\n\r\n [2] Rengger, _Natur. der Saeugethiere von Paraguay._ S. 334.\r\n\r\n_June_ 1_st._—We anchored in the fine bay of Port Famine. It was now\r\nthe beginning of winter, and I never saw a more cheerless prospect; the\r\ndusky woods, piebald with snow, could be only seen indistinctly through\r\na drizzling hazy atmosphere. We were, however, lucky in getting two\r\nfine days. On one of these, Mount Sarmiento, a distant mountain 6800\r\nfeet high, presented a very noble spectacle. I was frequently\r\nsurprised, in the scenery of Tierra del Fuego, at the little apparent\r\nelevation of mountains really lofty. I suspect it is owing to a cause\r\nwhich would not at first be imagined, namely, that the whole mass, from\r\nthe summit to the water’s edge, is generally in full view. I remember\r\nhaving seen a mountain, first from the Beagle Channel, where the whole\r\nsweep from the summit to the base was full in view, and then from\r\nPonsonby Sound across several successive ridges; and it was curious to\r\nobserve in the latter case, as each fresh ridge afforded fresh means of\r\njudging of the distance, how the mountain rose in height.\r\n\r\nBefore reaching Port Famine, two men were seen running along the shore\r\nand hailing the ship. A boat was sent for them.\r\nThey turned out to be two sailors who had run away from a\r\nsealing-vessel, and had joined the Patagonians. These Indians had\r\ntreated them with their usual disinterested hospitality. They had\r\nparted company through accident, and were then proceeding to Port\r\nFamine in hopes of finding some ship. I daresay they were worthless\r\nvagabonds, but I never saw more miserable-looking ones. They had been\r\nliving for some days on mussel-shells and berries, and their tattered\r\nclothes had been burnt by sleeping so near their fires. They had been\r\nexposed night and day, without any shelter, to the late incessant\r\ngales, with rain, sleet, and snow, and yet they were in good health.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nDuring our stay at Port Famine, the Fuegians twice came and plagued us.\r\nAs there were many instruments, clothes, and men on shore, it was\r\nthought necessary to frighten them away. The first time a few great\r\nguns were fired, when they were far distant. It was most ludicrous to\r\nwatch through a glass the Indians, as often as the shot struck the\r\nwater, take up stones, and, as a bold defiance, throw them towards the\r\nship, though about a mile and a half distant! A boat was then sent with\r\norders to fire a few musket-shots wide of them. The Fuegians hid\r\nthemselves behind the trees, and for every discharge of the muskets\r\nthey fired their arrows; all, however, fell short of the boat, and the\r\nofficer as he pointed at them laughed. This made the Fuegians frantic\r\nwith passion, and they shook their mantles in vain rage. At last,\r\nseeing the balls cut and strike the trees, they ran away, and we were\r\nleft in peace and quietness. During the former voyage the Fuegians were\r\nhere very troublesome, and to frighten them a rocket was fired at night\r\nover their wigwams; it answered effectually, and one of the officers\r\ntold me that the clamour first raised, and the barking of the dogs, was\r\nquite ludicrous in contrast with the profound silence which in a minute\r\nor two afterwards prevailed. The next morning not a single Fuegian was\r\nin the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nPatagonian spurs and pipe\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the _Beagle_ was here in the month of February, I started one\r\nmorning at four o’clock to ascend Mount Tarn, which is 2600 feet high,\r\nand is the most elevated point in this immediate district. We went in a\r\nboat to the foot of the mountain (but unluckily not to the best part),\r\nand then began our ascent. The forest commences at the line of\r\nhigh-water mark, and during the first two hours I gave over all hopes\r\nof reaching the summit. So thick was the wood, that it was necessary to\r\nhave constant recourse to the compass; for every landmark, though in a\r\nmountainous country, was completely shut out. In the deep ravines the\r\ndeath-like scene of desolation exceeded all description; outside it was\r\nblowing a gale, but in these hollows not even a breath of wind stirred\r\nthe leaves of the tallest trees. So gloomy, cold, and wet was every\r\npart, that not even the fungi, mosses, or ferns could flourish. In the\r\nvalleys it was scarcely possible to crawl along, they were so\r\ncompletely barricaded by great mouldering trunks, which had fallen down\r\nin every direction. When passing over these natural bridges, one’s\r\ncourse was often arrested by sinking knee deep into the rotten wood; at\r\nother times, when attempting to lean against a firm tree, one was\r\nstartled by finding a mass of decayed matter ready to fall at the\r\nslightest touch. We at last found ourselves among the stunted trees,\r\nand then soon reached the bare ridge, which conducted us to the summit.\r\nHere was a view characteristic of Tierra del Fuego; irregular chains of\r\nhills, mottled with patches\r\nof snow, deep yellowish-green valleys, and arms of the sea intersecting\r\nthe land in many directions. The strong wind was piercingly cold, and\r\nthe atmosphere rather hazy, so that we did not stay long on the top of\r\nthe mountain. Our descent was not quite so laborious as our ascent, for\r\nthe weight of the body forced a passage, and all the slips and falls\r\nwere in the right direction.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have already mentioned the sombre and dull character of the evergreen\r\nforests,[3] in which two or three species of trees grow, to the\r\nexclusion of all others. Above the forest land there are many dwarf\r\nalpine plants, which all spring from the mass of peat, and help to\r\ncompose it: these plants are very remarkable from their close alliance\r\nwith the species growing on the mountains of Europe, though so many\r\nthousand miles distant. The central part of Tierra del Fuego, where the\r\nclay-slate formation occurs, is most favourable to the growth of trees;\r\non the outer coast the poorer granitic soil, and a situation more\r\nexposed to the violent winds, do not allow of their attaining any great\r\nsize. Near Port Famine I have seen more large trees than anywhere else:\r\nI measured a Winter’s Bark which was four feet six inches in girth, and\r\nseveral of the beech were as much as thirteen feet. Captain King also\r\nmentions a beech which was seven feet in diameter seventeen feet above\r\nthe roots.\r\n\r\n [3] Captain Fitz Roy informs me that in April (our October) the leaves\r\n of those trees which grow near the base of the mountains change\r\n colour, but not those on the more elevated parts. I remember having\r\n read some observations, showing that in England the leaves fall\r\n earlier in a warm and fine autumn than in a late and cold one. The\r\n change in the colour being here retarded in the more elevated, and\r\n therefore colder situations, must be owing to the same general law of\r\n vegetation. The trees of Tierra del Fuego during no part of the year\r\n entirely shed their leaves.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThere is one vegetable production deserving notice from its importance\r\nas an article of food to the Fuegians. It is a globular, bright-yellow\r\nfungus, which grows in vast numbers on the beech-trees. When young it\r\nis elastic and turgid, with a smooth surface; but when mature, it\r\nshrinks, becomes tougher, and has its entire surface deeply pitted or\r\nhoneycombed, as represented in the figure at right. This fungus belongs\r\nto a new and curious genus;[4] I found a second\r\nspecies on another species of beech in Chile: and Dr. Hooker informs me\r\nthat just lately a third species has been discovered on a third species\r\nof beech in Van Diemen’s Land. How singular is this relationship\r\nbetween parasitical fungi and the trees on which they grow, in distant\r\nparts of the world! In Tierra del Fuego the fungus in its tough and\r\nmature state is collected in large quantities by the women and\r\nchildren, and is eaten uncooked. It has a mucilaginous, slightly sweet\r\ntaste, with a faint smell like that of a mushroom. With the exception\r\nof a few berries, chiefly of a dwarf arbutus, the natives eat no\r\nvegetable food besides this fungus. In New Zealand, before the\r\nintroduction of the potato, the roots of the fern were largely\r\nconsumed; at the present time, I believe, Tierra del Fuego is the only\r\ncountry in the world where a cryptogamic plant affords a staple article\r\nof food.\r\n\r\n [4] Described from my specimens and notes by the Reverend J. M.\r\n Berkeley in the _Linnean Transactions_ (vol. xix, p. 37), under the\r\n name of Cyttaria Darwinii: the Chilean species is the C. Berteroii.\r\n This genus is allied to Bulgaria.\r\n\r\nThe zoology of Tierra del Fuego, as might have been expected from the\r\nnature of its climate and vegetation, is very poor. Of mammalia,\r\nbesides whales and seals, there is one bat, a kind of mouse (Reithrodon\r\nchinchilloides), two true mice, a ctenomys allied to or identical with\r\nthe tucutuco, two foxes (Canis Magellanicus and C. Azaræ), a sea-otter,\r\nthe guanaco, and a deer. Most of these animals inhabit only the drier\r\neastern parts of the country; and the deer has never been seen south of\r\nthe Strait of Magellan. Observing the general correspondence of the\r\ncliffs of soft sandstone, mud, and shingle, on the opposite sides of\r\nthe Strait, and on some intervening islands, one is strongly tempted to\r\nbelieve that the land was once joined, and thus allowed animals so\r\ndelicate and helpless as the tucutuco and Reithrodon to pass over. The\r\ncorrespondence of the cliffs is far from proving any junction; because\r\nsuch cliffs generally are formed by the intersection of sloping\r\ndeposits, which, before the elevation of the land, had been accumulated\r\nnear the then existing shores. It is, however, a remarkable\r\ncoincidence, that in the two large islands cut off by the Beagle\r\nChannel from the rest of Tierra del Fuego, one has cliffs composed of\r\nmatter that may be called stratified alluvium, which front similar ones\r\non the opposite side of the\r\nchannel,—while the other is exclusively bordered by old crystalline\r\nrocks; in the former, called Navarin Island, both foxes and guanacos\r\noccur; but in the latter, Hoste Island, although similar in every\r\nrespect, and only separated by a channel a little more than half a mile\r\nwide, I have the word of Jemmy Button for saying that neither of these\r\nanimals is found.\r\n\r\nThe gloomy woods are inhabited by few birds: occasionally the plaintive\r\nnote of a white-tufted tyrant-flycatcher (Myiobius albiceps) may be\r\nheard, concealed near the summit of the most lofty trees; and more\r\nrarely the loud strange cry of a black woodpecker, with a fine scarlet\r\ncrest on its head. A little, dusky-coloured wren (Scytalopus\r\nMagellanicus) hops in a skulking manner among the entangled mass of the\r\nfallen and decaying trunks. But the creeper (Oxyurus tupinieri) is the\r\ncommonest bird in the country. Throughout the beech forests, high up\r\nand low down, in the most gloomy, wet, and impenetrable ravines, it may\r\nbe met with. This little bird no doubt appears more numerous than it\r\nreally is, from its habit of following with seeming curiosity any\r\nperson who enters these silent woods: continually uttering a harsh\r\ntwitter, it flutters from tree to tree, within a few feet of the\r\nintruder’s face. It is far from wishing for the modest concealment of\r\nthe true creeper (Certhia familiaris); nor does it, like that bird, run\r\nup the trunks of trees, but industriously, after the manner of a\r\nwillow-wren, hops about, and searches for insects on every twig and\r\nbranch. In the more open parts, three or four species of finches, a\r\nthrush, a starling (or Icterus), two Opetiorhynchi, and several hawks\r\nand owls occur.\r\n\r\nThe absence of any species whatever in the whole class of Reptiles is a\r\nmarked feature in the zoology of this country, as well as in that of\r\nthe Falkland Islands. I do not ground this statement merely on my own\r\nobservation, but I heard it from the Spanish inhabitants of the latter\r\nplace, and from Jemmy Button with regard to Tierra del Fuego. On the\r\nbanks of the Santa Cruz, in 50 degrees south, I saw a frog; and it is\r\nnot improbable that these animals, as well as lizards, may be found as\r\nfar south as the Strait of Magellan, where the country retains the\r\ncharacter of Patagonia; but within the damp and cold limit of Tierra\r\ndel Fuego not one occurs. That the climate would not have\r\nsuited some of the orders, such as lizards, might have been foreseen;\r\nbut with respect to frogs, this was not so obvious.\r\n\r\nBeetles occur in very small numbers: it was long before I could believe\r\nthat a country as large as Scotland, covered with vegetable productions\r\nand with a variety of stations, could be so unproductive. The few which\r\nI found were alpine species (Harpalidæ and Heteromidæ) living under\r\nstones. The vegetable-feeding Chrysomelidæ, so eminently characteristic\r\nof the Tropics, are here almost entirely absent;[5] I saw very few\r\nflies, butterflies, or bees, and no crickets or Orthoptera. In the\r\npools of water I found but few aquatic beetles, and not any fresh-water\r\nshells: Succinea at first appears an exception; but here it must be\r\ncalled a terrestrial shell, for it lives on the damp herbage far from\r\nwater. Land-shells could be procured only in the same alpine situations\r\nwith the beetles. I have already contrasted the climate as well as the\r\ngeneral appearance of Tierra del Fuego with that of Patagonia; and the\r\ndifference is strongly exemplified in the entomology. I do not believe\r\nthey have one species in common; certainly the general character of the\r\ninsects is widely different.\r\n\r\n [5] I believe I must except one alpine Haltica, and a single specimen\r\n of a Melasoma. Mr. Waterhouse informs me, that of the Harpalidæ there\r\n are eight or nine species—the forms of the greater number being very\r\n peculiar; of Heteromera, four or five species; of Rhyncophora, six or\r\n seven; and of the following families one species in each:\r\n Staphylinidæ, Elateridæ, Cebrionidæ, Melolonthidæ. The species in the\r\n other orders are even fewer. In all the orders, the scarcity of the\r\n individuals is even more remarkable than that of the species. Most of\r\n the Coleoptera have been carefully described by Mr. Waterhouse in the\r\n _Annals of Nat. Hist._\r\n\r\nIf we turn from the land to the sea, we shall find the latter as\r\nabundantly stocked with living creatures as the former is poorly so. In\r\nall parts of the world a rocky and partially protected shore perhaps\r\nsupports, in a given space, a greater number of individual animals than\r\nany other station. There is one marine production which, from its\r\nimportance, is worthy of a particular history. It is the kelp, or\r\nMacrocystis pyrifera. This plant grows on every rock from low-water\r\nmark to a great depth, both on the outer coast and within the\r\nchannels.[6] I\r\nbelieve, during the voyages of the _Adventure_ and _ Beagle_, not one\r\nrock near the surface was discovered which was not buoyed by this\r\nfloating weed. The good service it thus affords to vessels navigating\r\nnear this stormy land is evident; and it certainly has saved many a one\r\nfrom being wrecked. I know few things more surprising than to see this\r\nplant growing and flourishing amidst those great breakers of the\r\nwestern ocean, which no mass of rock, let it be ever so hard, can long\r\nresist. The stem is round, slimy, and smooth, and seldom has a diameter\r\nof so much as an inch. A few taken together are sufficiently strong to\r\nsupport the weight of the large loose stones, to which in the inland\r\nchannels they grow attached; and yet some of these stones were so heavy\r\nthat when drawn to the surface, they could scarcely be lifted into a\r\nboat by one person. Captain Cook, in his second voyage, says that this\r\nplant at Kerguelen Land rises from a greater depth than twenty-four\r\nfathoms; “and as it does not grow in a perpendicular direction, but\r\nmakes a very acute angle with the bottom, and much of it afterwards\r\nspreads many fathoms on the surface of the sea, I am well warranted to\r\nsay that some of it grows to the length of sixty fathoms and upwards.”\r\nI do not suppose the stem of any other plant attains so great a length\r\nas three hundred and sixty feet, as stated by Captain Cook. Captain\r\nFitz Roy, moreover, found it growing[7] up from the greater depth of\r\nforty-five fathoms. The beds of this sea-weed, even when of not great\r\nbreadth, make excellent natural floating breakwaters. It is quite\r\ncurious to see, in an exposed harbour, how soon the waves from the open\r\nsea, as they travel through the straggling stems, sink in height, and\r\npass into smooth water.\r\n\r\n [6] Its geographical range is remarkably wide; it is found from the\r\n extreme southern islets near Cape Horn, as far north on the eastern\r\n coast (according to information given me by Mr. Stokes) as lat.\r\n 43°,—but on the western coast, as Dr. Hooker tells me, it extends to\r\n the R. San Francisco in California, and perhaps even to Kamtschatka.\r\n We thus have an immense range in latitude; and as Cook, who must have\r\n been well acquainted with the species, found it at Kerguelen Land, no\r\n less than 140° in longitude.\r\n\r\n\r\n [7] _Voyages of the Adventure and Beagle_, vol. i, p. 363. It appears\r\n that seaweed grows extremely quick. Mr. Stephenson found (Wilson’s\r\n _Voyage round Scotland_ vol. ii, p. 228) that a rock uncovered only at\r\n spring-tides, which had been chiselled smooth in November, on the\r\n following May, that is, within six months afterwards, was thickly\r\n covered with Fucus digitatus two feet, and F. esculentus six feet, in\r\n length.\r\n\r\nThe number of living creatures of all Orders, whose existence\r\nintimately depends on the kelp, is wonderful. A great volume might be\r\nwritten, describing the inhabitants of one of these beds of seaweed.\r\nAlmost all the leaves, excepting those that float on the surface, are\r\nso thickly incrusted with corallines as\r\nto be of a white colour. We find exquisitely delicate structures, some\r\ninhabited by simple hydra-like polypi, others by more organised kinds,\r\nand beautiful compound Ascidiæ. On the leaves, also, various\r\npatelliform shells, Trochi, uncovered molluscs, and some bivalves are\r\nattached. Innumerable crustacea frequent every part of the plant. On\r\nshaking the great entangled roots, a pile of small fish, shells,\r\ncuttlefish, crabs of all orders, sea-eggs, starfish, beautiful\r\nHolothuriæ, Planariæ, and crawling nereidous animals of a multitude of\r\nforms, all fall out together. Often as I recurred to a branch of the\r\nkelp, I never failed to discover animals of new and curious structures.\r\nIn Chiloe, where the kelp does not thrive very well, the numerous\r\nshells, corallines, and crustacea are absent; but there yet remain a\r\nfew of the Flustraceæ, and some compound Ascidiæ; the latter, however,\r\nare of different species from those in Tierra del Fuego; we see here\r\nthe fucus possessing a wider range than the animals which use it as an\r\nabode. I can only compare these great aquatic forests of the southern\r\nhemisphere with the terrestrial ones in the intertropical regions. Yet\r\nif in any country a forest was destroyed, I do not believe nearly so\r\nmany species of animals would perish as would here, from the\r\ndestruction of the kelp. Amidst the leaves of this plant numerous\r\nspecies of fish live, which nowhere else could find food or shelter;\r\nwith their destruction the many cormorants and other fishing birds, the\r\notters, seals, and porpoises, would soon perish also; and lastly, the\r\nFuegian savage, the miserable lord of this miserable land, would\r\nredouble his cannibal feast, decrease in numbers, and perhaps cease to\r\nexist.\r\n\r\n_June_ 8_th._—We weighed anchor early in the morning and left Port\r\nFamine. Captain Fitz Roy determined to leave the Strait of Magellan by\r\nthe Magdalen Channel, which had not long been discovered. Our course\r\nlay due south, down that gloomy passage which I have before alluded to\r\nas appearing to lead to another and worse world. The wind was fair, but\r\nthe atmosphere was very thick; so that we missed much curious scenery.\r\nThe dark ragged clouds were rapidly driven over the mountains, from\r\ntheir summits nearly down to their bases. The glimpses which we caught\r\nthrough the dusky mass were highly interesting; jagged points, cones of\r\nsnow, blue glaciers, strong outlines, marked on a lurid sky, were seen\r\nat different distances and\r\nheights. In the midst of such scenery we anchored at Cape Turn, close\r\nto Mount Sarmiento, which was then hidden in the clouds. At the base of\r\nthe lofty and almost perpendicular sides of our little cove there was\r\none deserted wigwam, and it alone reminded us that man sometimes\r\nwandered into these desolate regions. But it would be difficult to\r\nimagine a scene where he seemed to have fewer claims or less authority.\r\nThe inanimate works of nature—rock, ice, snow, wind, and water, all\r\nwarring with each other, yet combined against man—here reigned in\r\nabsolute sovereignty.\r\n\r\n_June_ 9_th._—In the morning we were delighted by seeing the veil of\r\nmist gradually rise from Sarmiento, and display it to our view. This\r\nmountain, which is one of the highest in Tierra del Fuego, has an\r\naltitude of 6800 feet. Its base, for about an eighth of its total\r\nheight, is clothed by dusky woods, and above this a field of snow\r\nextends to the summit. These vast piles of snow, which never melt, and\r\nseem destined to last as long as the world holds together, present a\r\nnoble and even sublime spectacle. The outline of the mountain was\r\nadmirably clear and defined. Owing to the abundance of light reflected\r\nfrom the white and glittering surface, no shadows were cast on any\r\npart; and those lines which intersected the sky could alone be\r\ndistinguished: hence the mass stood out in the boldest relief. Several\r\nglaciers descended in a winding course from the upper great expanse of\r\nsnow to the sea-coast: they may be likened to great frozen Niagaras;\r\nand perhaps these cataracts of blue ice are full as beautiful as the\r\nmoving ones of water. By night we reached the western part of the\r\nchannel; but the water was so deep that no anchorage could be found. We\r\nwere in consequence obliged to stand off and on in this narrow arm of\r\nthe sea, during a pitch-dark night of fourteen hours long.\r\n\r\n_June_ 10_th._—In the morning we made the best of our way into the open\r\nPacific. The western coast generally consists of low, rounded, quite\r\nbarren hills of granite and greenstone. Sir J. Narborough called one\r\npart South Desolation, because it is “so desolate a land to behold:”\r\nand well indeed might he say so. Outside the main islands there are\r\nnumberless scattered rocks on which the long swell of the open ocean\r\nincessantly rages. We passed out between the East and West Furies;\r\nand a little farther northward there are so many breakers that the sea\r\nis called the Milky Way. One sight of such a coast is enough to make a\r\nlandsman dream for a week about shipwrecks, peril, and death; and with\r\nthis sight we bade farewell for ever to Tierra del Fuego.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following discussion on the climate of the southern parts of the\r\ncontinent with relation to its productions, on the snow-line, on the\r\nextraordinarily low descent of the glaciers, and on the zone of\r\nperpetual congelation in the antarctic islands, may be passed over by\r\nany one not interested in these curious subjects, or the final\r\nrecapitulation alone may be read. I shall, however, here give only an\r\nabstract, and must refer for details to the Thirteenth Chapter and the\r\nAppendix of the former edition of this work.\r\n\r\n_On the Climate and Productions of Tierra del Fuego and of the\r\nSouth-west Coast._—The following table gives the mean temperature of\r\nTierra del Fuego, the Falkland Islands, and, for comparison, that of\r\nDublin:—\r\n\r\n                                 Summer   Winter   Mean of Summer\r\n                   Latitude.     Temp.    Temp.    and Winter.\r\n\r\nTierra del Fuego   53° 38′ S.    50°      33.08°   41.54°\r\nFalkland Islands   51° 30′ S.    51°      —        —\r\nDublin             53° 21′ N.    59.54°   39.20°   49.37°\r\n\r\nHence we see that the central part of Tierra del Fuego is colder in\r\nwinter, and no less than 9.5° less hot in summer, than Dublin.\r\nAccording to von Buch the mean temperature of July (not the hottest\r\nmonth in the year) at Saltenfiord in Norway, is as high as 57.8°, and\r\nthis place is actually 13° nearer the pole than Port Famine![8]\r\nInhospitable as this climate appears to our feelings, evergreen trees\r\nflourish luxuriantly under it. Humming-birds may be seen sucking the\r\nflowers, and parrots feeding on the seeds of the Winter’s Bark, in\r\nlatitude 55 degrees south. I have already remarked to what a degree the\r\nsea swarms with living creatures; and the shells\r\n(such as the Patellæ, Fissurellæ, Chitons, and Barnacles), according to\r\nMr. G. B. Sowerby, are of a much larger size, and of a more vigorous\r\ngrowth, than the analogous species in the northern hemisphere. A large\r\nVoluta is abundant in southern Tierra del Fuego and the Falkland\r\nIslands. At Bahia Blanca, in lat. 39° S., the most abundant shells were\r\nthree species of Oliva (one of large size), one or two Volutas, and a\r\nTerebra. Now these are amongst the best characterised tropical forms.\r\nIt is doubtful whether even one small species of Oliva exists on the\r\nsouthern shores of Europe, and there are no species of the two other\r\ngenera. If a geologist were to find in lat. 39° on the coast of\r\nPortugal a bed containing numerous shells belonging to three species of\r\nOliva, to a Voluta, and Terebra, he would probably assert that the\r\nclimate at the period of their existence must have been tropical; but,\r\njudging from South America, such an inference might be erroneous.\r\n\r\n [8] With respect to Tierra del Fuego, the results are deduced from the\r\n observations of Capt. King (_Geographical Journal_, 1830), and those\r\n taken on board the _Beagle._ For the Falkland Islands, I am indebted\r\n to Captain Sulivan for the mean of the mean temperature (reduced from\r\n careful observation at midnight, 8 A.M., noon, and 8 P.M.) of the\r\n three hottest months, namely, December, January, and February. The\r\n temperature of Dublin is taken from Barton.\r\n\r\nThe equable, humid, and windy climate of Tierra del Fuego extends, with\r\nonly a small increase of heat, for many degrees along the west coast of\r\nthe continent. The forests for 600 miles northward of Cape Horn, have a\r\nvery similar aspect. As a proof of the equable climate, even for 300 or\r\n400 miles still farther northward, I may mention that in Chiloe\r\n(corresponding in latitude with the northern parts of Spain) the peach\r\nseldom produces fruit, whilst strawberries and apples thrive to\r\nperfection. Even the crops of barley and wheat[9] are often brought\r\ninto the houses to be dried and ripened. At Valdivia (in the same\r\nlatitude of 40° with Madrid) grapes and figs ripen, but are not common;\r\nolives seldom ripen even partially, and oranges not at all. These\r\nfruits, in corresponding latitudes in Europe, are well known to succeed\r\nto perfection; and even in this continent, at the Rio Negro, under\r\nnearly the same parallel with Valdivia, sweet potatoes (convolvulus)\r\nare cultivated; and grapes, figs, olives, oranges, water and musk\r\nmelons, produce abundant fruit. Although the humid and equable climate\r\nof Chiloe, and of the coast northward and southward of it, is so\r\nunfavourable to our fruits, yet the native forests, from lat. 45° to\r\n38°, almost rival in luxuriance those of the glowing intertropical\r\nregions. Stately trees of many kinds, with smooth and highly coloured\r\nbarks, are loaded by parasitical monocotyledonous\r\nplants; large and elegant ferns are numerous, and arborescent grasses\r\nentwine the trees into one entangled mass to the height of thirty or\r\nforty feet above the ground. Palm-trees grow in latitude 37°; an\r\narborescent grass, very like a bamboo, in 40°; and another closely\r\nallied kind, of great length, but not erect, flourishes even as far\r\nsouth as 45° S.\r\n\r\n [9] Agüeros, _Descrip. Hist. de la Prov. de Chiloé_, 1791, p. 94.\r\n\r\nAn equable climate, evidently due to the large area of sea compared\r\nwith the land, seems to extend over the greater part of the southern\r\nhemisphere; and as a consequence, the vegetation partakes of a\r\nsemi-tropical character. Tree-ferns thrive luxuriantly in Van Diemen’s\r\nLand (lat. 45°), and I measured one trunk no less than six feet in\r\ncircumference. An arborescent fern was found by Forster in New Zealand\r\nin 46°, where orchideous plants are parasitical on the trees. In the\r\nAuckland Islands, ferns, according to Dr. Dieffenbach,[10] have trunks\r\nso thick and high that they may be almost called tree-ferns; and in\r\nthese islands, and even as far south as lat. 55° in the Macquarie\r\nIslands, parrots abound.\r\n\r\n [10] See the German Translation of this Journal; and for the other\r\n facts Mr. Brown’s Appendix to Flinders’s _ Voyage._\r\n\r\n_On the Height of the Snow-line, and on the Descent of the Glaciers, in\r\nSouth America._—For the detailed authorities for the following table, I\r\nmust refer to the former edition:—\r\n\r\n     Latitude.

The difference in\r\nheight, namely, about 9000 feet, between the snow-line on the\r\nCordillera behind Chiloe (with its highest points ranging from\r\nonly 5600 to 7500 feet) and in central Chile[11] (a distance of only 9°\r\nof latitude), is truly wonderful. The land from the southward of Chiloe\r\nto near Concepcion (lat. 37°) is hidden by one dense forest dripping\r\nwith moisture. The sky is cloudy, and we have seen how badly the fruits\r\nof southern Europe succeed. In central Chile, on the other hand, a\r\nlittle northward of Concepcion, the sky is generally clear, rain does\r\nnot fall for the seven summer months, and southern European fruits\r\nsucceed admirably; and even the sugar-cane has been cultivated.[12] No\r\ndoubt the plane of perpetual snow undergoes the above remarkable\r\nflexure of 9000 feet, unparalleled in other parts of the world, not far\r\nfrom the latitude of Concepcion, where the land ceases to be covered\r\nwith forest-trees; for trees in South America indicate a rainy climate,\r\nand rain a clouded sky and little heat in summer.\r\n\r\n [11] On the Cordillera of central Chile, I believe the snow-line\r\n varies exceedingly in height in different summers. I was assured that\r\n during one very dry and long summer, all the snow disappeared from\r\n Aconcagua, although it attains the prodigious height of 23,000 feet.\r\n It is probable that much of the snow at these great heights is\r\n evaporated, rather than thawed.\r\n\r\n\r\n [12] Miers’s _Chile_, vol. i, p. 415. It is said that the sugar-cane\r\n grew at Ingenio, lat. 32° to 33°, but not in sufficient quantity to\r\n make the manufacture profitable. In the valley of Quillota, south of\r\n Ingenio, I saw some large date-palm trees.\r\n\r\n\r\nEyre Sound\r\n\r\nThe descent of glaciers to the sea must, I conceive, mainly depend\r\n(subject, of course, to a proper supply of snow in the upper region) on\r\nthe lowness of the line of perpetual snow on steep mountains near the\r\ncoast. As the snow-line is so low in Tierra del Fuego, we might have\r\nexpected that many of the glaciers would have reached the sea.\r\nNevertheless I was astonished when I first saw a range, only from 3000\r\nto 4000 feet in height, in the latitude of Cumberland, with every\r\nvalley filled with streams of ice descending to the sea-coast. Almost\r\nevery arm of the sea, which penetrates to the interior higher chain,\r\nnot only in Tierra del Fuego, but on the coast for 650 miles\r\nnorthwards, is terminated by “tremendous and astonishing glaciers,” as\r\ndescribed by one of the officers on the survey. Great masses of ice\r\nfrequently fall from these icy cliffs, and the crash reverberates like\r\nthe broadside of a man-of-war through the lonely channels. These falls,\r\nas noticed in the last chapter, produce great waves which break on the\r\nadjoining coasts. It is known that earthquakes frequently cause masses\r\nof earth to fall from sea-cliffs: how terrific, then, would be the\r\neffect of a severe shock (and such occur here[13]) on a body like a\r\nglacier, already in motion, and traversed by fissures! I can readily\r\nbelieve that the water would be fairly beaten back out of the deepest\r\nchannel, and then, returning with an overwhelming force, would whirl\r\nabout huge masses of rock like so much chaff. In Eyre’s Sound, in the\r\nlatitude of Paris, there are immense glaciers, and yet the loftiest\r\nneighbouring mountain is only 6200 feet high. In this Sound, about\r\nfifty icebergs were seen at one time floating outwards, and one of them\r\nmust have been _at least_ 168 feet in total height. Some of the\r\nicebergs were loaded with blocks of no inconsiderable size, of granite\r\nand other rocks, different from the clay-slate of the surrounding\r\nmountains. The glacier farthest from the Pole, surveyed during the\r\nvoyages of the _Adventure_ and _Beagle_, is in lat. 46° 50′, in the\r\nGulf of Penas. It is 15 miles long, and in one part 7 broad, and\r\ndescends to the sea-coast. But even a few miles northward of this\r\nglacier, in the Laguna de San Rafael, some Spanish missionaries[14]\r\nencountered “many icebergs, some great, some small, and others\r\nmiddle-sized,” in a narrow arm of the sea, on the 22nd of the month\r\ncorresponding with our\r\nJune, and in a latitude corresponding with that of the Lake of Geneva!\r\n\r\n [13] Bulkeley’s and Cummin’s _Faithful Narrative of the Loss of the\r\n Wager._ The earthquake happened August 25, 1741.\r\n\r\n\r\n [14] Agüeros, _Desc. Hist. de Chiloé_, p. 227.\r\n\r\n\r\nGlacier in Gulf of Penas\r\n\r\nIn Europe, the most southern glacier which comes down to the sea is met\r\nwith, according to Von Buch, on the coast of Norway, in lat. 67°. Now,\r\nthis is more than 20° of latitude, or 1230 miles, nearer the pole than\r\nthe Laguna de San Rafael. The position of the glaciers at this place\r\nand in the Gulf of Penas may be put even in a more striking point of\r\nview, for they descend to the sea-coast within 7½° degrees of latitude,\r\nor 450 miles, of a harbour, where three species of Oliva, a Voluta, and\r\na Terebra, are the commonest shells, within less than 9° from where\r\npalms grow, within 4½° of a region where the jaguar and puma range over\r\nthe plains, less than 2½° from arborescent grasses, and (looking to the\r\nwestward in the same hemisphere) less than 2° from orchideous\r\nparasites, and within a single degree of tree-ferns!\r\n\r\nThese facts are of high geological interest with respect to the climate\r\nof the northern hemisphere, at the period when boulders were\r\ntransported. I will not here detail how simply the theory of icebergs\r\nbeing charged with fragments of rock explains the origin and position\r\nof the gigantic boulders of eastern Tierra del Fuego, on the high plain\r\nof Santa Cruz, and on the island of Chiloe. In Tierra del Fuego the\r\ngreater number of boulders lie on the lines of old sea-channels, now\r\nconverted into dry valleys by the elevation of the land. They are\r\nassociated with a great unstratified formation of mud and sand,\r\ncontaining rounded and angular fragments of all sizes, which has\r\noriginated[15] in the repeated ploughing up of the sea-bottom by the\r\nstranding of icebergs, and by the matter transported on them. Few\r\ngeologists now doubt that those erratic boulders which lie near lofty\r\nmountains have been pushed forward by the glaciers themselves, and that\r\nthose distant from mountains, and embedded in subaqueous deposits, have\r\nbeen conveyed thither either on icebergs, or frozen in coast-ice. The\r\nconnection between the transportal of boulders and the presence of ice\r\nin some form, is strikingly shown by their geographical distribution\r\nover the earth. In South America they are not found farther than 48° of\r\nlatitude, measured from the southern pole; in North America it appears\r\nthat the limit of their transportal extends to 53½° from the northern\r\npole; but in Europe to not more than 40° of latitude, measured from the\r\nsame point. On the other hand, in the intertropical parts of America,\r\nAsia, and Africa, they have never been observed; nor at the Cape of\r\nGood Hope, nor in Australia.[16]\r\n\r\n [15] _Geological Transactions_, vol. vi, p. 415.\r\n\r\n\r\n [16] I have given details (the first, I believe, published) on this\r\n subject in the first edition, and in the Appendix to it. I have there\r\n shown that the apparent exceptions to the absence of erratic boulders\r\n in certain hot countries are due to erroneous observations; several\r\n statements there given I have since found confirmed by various\r\n authors.\r\n\r\n\r\n_On the Climate and Productions of the Antarctic Islands._—Considering\r\nthe rankness of the vegetation in Tierra del Fuego, and on the coast\r\nnorthward of it, the condition of the islands south and south-west of\r\nAmerica is truly surprising. Sandwich Land, in the latitude of the\r\nnorth part of Scotland, was found by Cook, during the hottest month of\r\nthe year, “covered many fathoms thick with everlasting snow;” and there\r\nseems to be scarcely any vegetation. Georgia, an island 96 miles long\r\nand 10 broad, in the latitude of Yorkshire, “in the very height of\r\nsummer, is in a manner wholly covered with frozen snow.” It can boast\r\nonly of moss, some tufts of grass, and wild burnet; it has only one\r\nland-bird (Anthus correndera), yet Iceland, which is 10° nearer the\r\npole, has, according to Mackenzie, fifteen land-birds. The South\r\nShetland Islands, in the same latitude as the southern half of Norway,\r\npossess only some lichens, moss, and a little grass; and Lieut.\r\nKendall[17] found the bay in which he was at anchor, beginning to\r\nfreeze at a period corresponding with our 8th of September. The soil\r\nhere consists of ice and volcanic ashes interstratified; and at a\r\nlittle depth beneath the surface it must remain perpetually congealed,\r\nfor Lieut. Kendall found the body of a foreign sailor which had long\r\nbeen buried, with the flesh and all the features perfectly preserved.\r\nIt is a singular fact that on the two great continents in the northern\r\nhemisphere (but not in the broken land of Europe between them) we have\r\nthe zone of perpetually frozen under-soil in a low latitude—namely, in\r\n56 degrees in North America at the depth of three feet,[18] and in 62°\r\nin Siberia at the depth of twelve to fifteen feet—as the result of a\r\ndirectly opposite condition of things to those of the southern\r\nhemisphere. On the northern continents, the winter is rendered\r\nexcessively cold by the radiation from a large area of land into a\r\nclear sky, nor is it moderated by the warmth-bringing currents of the\r\nsea; the short summer, on the other hand, is hot. In the Southern Ocean\r\nthe winter is not so excessively cold, but the summer is far less hot,\r\nfor the clouded sky seldom allows the sun to warm the ocean, itself a\r\nbad absorbent of heat: and hence the mean temperature of the year,\r\nwhich regulates the zone of perpetually congealed under-soil, is low.\r\nIt is evident that a rank vegetation, which does not so much require\r\nheat as it does protection from intense cold, would approach much\r\nnearer to this zone of perpetual congelation under the equable climate\r\nof the southern hemisphere, than under the extreme climate of the\r\nnorthern continents.\r\n\r\n [17] _Geographical Journal_, 1830, pp. 65, 66.\r\n\r\n\r\n [18] Richardson’s _Append. to Back’s Exped._ and Humboldt’s _ Fragm.\r\n Asiat._ tome ii, p. 386.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe case of the sailor’s body perfectly preserved in the icy soil of\r\nthe South Shetland Islands (lat. 62° to 63° S.), in a rather lower\r\nlatitude than that (lat. 64° N.) under which Pallas found the frozen\r\nrhinoceros in Siberia, is very interesting. Although it is a fallacy,\r\nas I have endeavoured to show in a former chapter, to suppose that the\r\nlarger quadrupeds require a luxuriant vegetation for their support,\r\nnevertheless it is important to find in the South Shetland Islands a\r\nfrozen under-soil within 360 miles of the forest-clad islands near Cape\r\nHorn, where, as far as the _ bulk_ of vegetation is concerned, any\r\nnumber of great quadrupeds might be supported. The perfect preservation\r\nof the carcasses of the Siberian elephants and rhinoceroses is\r\ncertainly one of the most wonderful facts in geology; but independently\r\nof the imagined difficulty of supplying them with food from the\r\nadjoining countries, the whole case is not, I think, so perplexing as\r\nit has generally been considered. The plains of Siberia, like those of\r\nthe Pampas, appear to have been formed under the sea, into which rivers\r\nbrought down the bodies of many animals; of the greater number of these\r\nonly the skeletons have been preserved, but of others the perfect\r\ncarcass. Now it is known that in the shallow sea on the Arctic coast of\r\nAmerica the bottom freezes,[19] and does not thaw in spring so soon as\r\nthe surface\r\nof the land, moreover, at greater depths, where the bottom of the sea\r\ndoes not freeze, the mud a few feet beneath the top layer might remain\r\neven in summer below 32°, as is the case on the land with the soil at\r\nthe depth of a few feet. At still greater depths the temperature of the\r\nmud and water would probably not be low enough to preserve the flesh;\r\nand hence, carcasses drifted beyond the shallow parts near an arctic\r\ncoast, would have only their skeletons preserved: now in the extreme\r\nnorthern parts of Siberia bones are infinitely numerous, so that even\r\nislets are said to be almost composed of them;[20] and those islets lie\r\nno less than ten degrees of latitude north of the place where Pallas\r\nfound the frozen rhinoceros. On the other hand, a carcass washed by a\r\nflood into a shallow part of the Arctic Sea, would be preserved for an\r\nindefinite period, if it were soon afterwards covered with mud\r\nsufficiently thick to prevent the heat of the summer water penetrating\r\nto it; and if, when the sea-bottom was upraised into land, the covering\r\nwas sufficiently thick to prevent the heat of the summer air and sun\r\nthawing and corrupting it.\r\n\r\n [19] Messrs. Dease and Simpson, in _Geographical Journal_ vol. viii,\r\n pp. 218 and 220.\r\n\r\n\r\n [20] Cuvier (_Ossemens Fossiles,_ tome i, p. 151), from Billing’s\r\n _Voyage._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Recapitulation._—I will recapitulate the principal facts with regard\r\nto the climate, ice-action, and organic productions of the southern\r\nhemisphere, transposing the places in imagination to Europe, with which\r\nwe are so much better acquainted. Then, near Lisbon, the commonest\r\nsea-shells, namely, three species of Oliva, a Voluta, and a Terebra,\r\nwould have a tropical character. In the southern provinces of France,\r\nmagnificent forests, intwined by arborescent grasses and with the trees\r\nloaded with parasitical plants, would hide the face of the land. The\r\npuma and the jaguar would haunt the Pyrenees. In the latitude of Mont\r\nBlanc, but on an island as far westward as Central North America,\r\ntree-ferns and parasitical Orchideæ would thrive amidst the thick\r\nwoods. Even as far north as central Denmark humming-birds would be seen\r\nfluttering about delicate flowers, and parrots feeding amidst the\r\nevergreen woods; and in the sea there we should have a Voluta, and all\r\nthe shells of large size and vigorous growth. Nevertheless, on some\r\nislands only 360 miles northward of our new Cape Horn in Denmark, a\r\ncarcass buried in the soil (or if washed into a shallow sea, and\r\ncovered up with mud) would be preserved perpetually frozen. If some\r\nbold navigator attempted to penetrate northward of these islands, he\r\nwould run a thousand dangers amidst gigantic icebergs, on some of which\r\nhe would see great blocks of rock borne far away from their original\r\nsite. Another island of large size in the latitude of southern\r\nScotland, but twice as far to the west, would be “almost wholly covered\r\nwith everlasting snow,” and would have each bay terminated by\r\nice-cliffs, whence great masses would be yearly detached: this island\r\nwould boast only of a little moss, grass, and burnet, and a titlark\r\nwould be its only land inhabitant. From our new Cape Horn in Denmark, a\r\nchain of mountains, scarcely half the height of the Alps, would run in\r\na straight line due southward; and on its western flank every deep\r\ncreek of the sea, or fiord, would end in “bold and astonishing\r\nglaciers.” These lonely channels would frequently reverberate with the\r\nfalls of ice, and so often would great waves rush along their coasts;\r\nnumerous icebergs, some as tall as cathedrals, and occasionally loaded\r\nwith “no inconsiderable blocks of rock,” would be stranded on the\r\noutlying islets; at intervals violent earthquakes would shoot\r\nprodigious masses of ice into the waters below. Lastly, some\r\nmissionaries\r\nattempting to penetrate a long arm of the sea, would behold the not\r\nlofty surrounding mountains, sending down their many grand icy streams\r\nto the sea-coast, and their progress in the boats would be checked by\r\nthe innumerable floating icebergs, some small and some great; and this\r\nwould have occurred on our twenty-second of June, and where the Lake of\r\nGeneva is now spread out![21]\r\n\r\n [21] In the former edition and Appendix, I have given some facts on\r\n the transportal of erratic boulders and icebergs in the Antarctic\r\n Ocean. This subject has lately been treated excellently by Mr. Hayes,\r\n in the _Boston Journal_ (vol. iv, p. 426). The author does not appear\r\n aware of a case published by me (_Geographical Journal_, vol. ix, p.\r\n 528), of a gigantic boulder embedded in an iceberg in the Antarctic\r\n Ocean, almost certainly one hundred miles distant from any land, and\r\n perhaps much more distant. In the Appendix I have discussed at length\r\n the probability (at that time hardly thought of) of icebergs, when\r\n stranded, grooving and polishing rocks, like glaciers. This is now a\r\n very commonly received opinion; and I cannot still avoid the suspicion\r\n that it is applicable even to such cases as that of the Jura. Dr.\r\n Richardson has assured me that the icebergs off North America push\r\n before them pebbles and sand, and leave the submarine rocky flats\r\n quite bare; it is hardly possible to doubt that such ledges must be\r\n polished and scored in the direction of the set of the prevailing\r\n currents. Since writing that Appendix I have seen in North Wales\r\n (_London Phil. Mag._ vol. xxi, p. 180) the adjoining action of\r\n glaciers and floating icebergs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Trochilus Forficatus]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XII\r\n\r\n\r\nValparaiso—Excursion to the Foot of the Andes—Structure of the\r\nland—Ascend the Bell of Quillota—Shattered masses of greenstone—Immense\r\nvalleys—Mines—State of miners—Santiago—Hot-baths of\r\nCauquenes—Gold-mines—Grinding-mills—Perforated stones—Habits of the\r\nPuma—El Turco and Tapacolo—Humming-birds.\r\n\r\nCENTRAL CHILE\r\n\r\n_July_ 23_rd._—The _Beagle_ anchored late at night in the bay of\r\nValparaiso, the chief seaport of Chile. When morning came, everything\r\nappeared delightful. After Tierra del Fuego, the climate felt quite\r\ndelicious—the atmosphere so dry, and the heavens so clear and blue with\r\nthe sun shining brightly, that all nature seemed sparkling with life.\r\nThe view from the anchorage is very pretty. The town is built at the\r\nvery foot of a range of hills, about 1600 feet high, and rather steep.\r\nFrom its position, it consists of one long, straggling street, which\r\nruns parallel to the beach, and wherever a ravine comes down, the\r\nhouses are piled up on each side of it. The rounded hills, being only\r\npartially protected by a very scanty vegetation, are worn into\r\nnumberless little gullies, which expose a singularly bright red soil.\r\nFrom this cause, and from the low whitewashed houses with tile roofs,\r\nthe view reminded me of St. Cruz in Teneriffe. In a north-easterly\r\ndirection there are some fine glimpses of the Andes: but these\r\nmountains appear much grander when viewed from the neighbouring hills:\r\nthe great distance at which they are situated can then more readily be\r\nperceived. The volcano of Aconcagua is particularly magnificent. This\r\nhuge and irregularly conical mass has an elevation greater than that of\r\nChimborazo; for, from measurements made by the officers in the\r\n_Beagle_, its height is no less than 23,000 feet. The Cordillera,\r\nhowever, viewed from this point, owe the greater part of their beauty\r\nto the atmosphere through which they are seen. When the sun was setting\r\nin the Pacific, it was admirable to watch how clearly their rugged\r\noutlines could be distinguished, yet how varied and how delicate were\r\nthe shades of their colour.\r\n\r\nI had the good fortune to find living here Mr. Richard Corfield, an old\r\nschoolfellow and friend, to whose hospitality and kindness I was\r\ngreatly indebted, in having afforded me a most pleasant residence\r\nduring the _Beagle’s_ stay in Chile. The immediate neighbourhood of\r\nValparaiso is not very productive to the naturalist. During the long\r\nsummer the wind blows steadily from the southward, and a little off\r\nshore, so that rain never falls; during the three winter months,\r\nhowever, it is sufficiently abundant. The vegetation in consequence is\r\nvery scanty: except in some deep valleys there are no trees, and only a\r\nlittle grass and a few low bushes are scattered over the less steep\r\nparts of the hills. When we reflect that at the distance of 350 miles\r\nto the south, this side of the Andes is completely hidden by one\r\nimpenetrable forest, the contrast is very remarkable. I took several\r\nlong walks while collecting objects of natural history. The country is\r\npleasant for exercise. There are many very beautiful flowers; and, as\r\nin most other dry climates, the plants and shrubs possess strong and\r\npeculiar odours—even one’s clothes by brushing through them became\r\nscented. I did not cease from wonder at finding each succeeding day as\r\nfine as the foregoing. What a difference does climate make in the\r\nenjoyment of life! How opposite are the sensations when viewing black\r\nmountains half-enveloped in clouds, and seeing another range through\r\nthe light blue haze of a fine day! The one for a time may be very\r\nsublime; the other is all gaiety and happy life.\r\n\r\n_August_ 14_th._—I set out on a riding excursion, for the purpose of\r\ngeologising the basal parts of the Andes, which alone at this time of\r\nthe year are not shut up by the winter snow. Our first day’s ride was\r\nnorthward along the sea-coast. After dark we reached the Hacienda of\r\nQuintero, the estate which formerly belonged to Lord Cochrane. My\r\nobject in coming here was to see the great beds of shells which stand\r\nsome yards above the level of the sea, and are burnt for lime. The\r\nproofs of the elevation of this whole line of coast are unequivocal: at\r\nthe height of a few hundred feet old-looking shells are numerous, and I\r\nfound some at 1300 feet. These shells either lie loose on the surface,\r\nor are embedded in a reddish-black vegetable mould. I was much\r\nsurprised to find under the microscope that this vegetable mould is\r\nreally marine mud, full of minute particles of organic bodies.\r\n\r\n15_th._—We returned towards the valley of Quillota. The country was\r\nexceedingly pleasant; just such as poets would call pastoral: green\r\nopen lawns, separated by small valleys with rivulets, and the cottages,\r\nwe may suppose of the shepherds, scattered on the hill-sides. We were\r\nobliged to cross the ridge of the Chilicauquen. At its base there were\r\nmany fine evergreen forest-trees, but these flourished only in the\r\nravines, where there was running water. Any person who had seen only\r\nthe country near Valparaiso would never have imagined that there had\r\nbeen such picturesque spots in Chile. As soon as we reached the brow of\r\nthe Sierra, the valley of Quillota was immediately under our feet. The\r\nprospect was one of remarkable artificial luxuriance. The valley is\r\nvery broad and quite flat, and is thus easily irrigated in all parts.\r\nThe little square gardens are crowded with orange and olive trees and\r\nevery sort of vegetable. On each side huge bare mountains rise, and\r\nthis from the contrast renders the patchwork valley the more pleasing.\r\nWhoever called “Valparaiso” the “Valley of\r\nParadise,” must have been thinking of Quillota. We crossed over to the\r\nHacienda de San Isidro, situated at the very foot of the Bell Mountain.\r\n\r\nHacienda, condor, cactus, etc.\r\n\r\nChile, as may be seen in the maps, is a narrow strip of land between\r\nthe Cordillera and the Pacific; and this strip is itself traversed by\r\nseveral mountain-lines, which in this part run parallel to the great\r\nrange. Between these outer lines and the main Cordillera, a succession\r\nof level basins, generally opening into each other by narrow passages,\r\nextend far to the southward: in these, the principal towns are\r\nsituated, as San Felipe, Santiago, San Fernando. These basins or\r\nplains, together with the transverse flat valleys (like that of\r\nQuillota) which connect them with the coast, I have no doubt are the\r\nbottoms of ancient inlets and deep bays, such as at the present day\r\nintersect every part of Tierra del Fuego and the western coast. Chile\r\nmust formerly have resembled the latter country in the configuration of\r\nits land and water. The resemblance was occasionally shown strikingly\r\nwhen a level fog-bank covered, as with a mantle, all the lower parts of\r\nthe country: the white vapour curling into the ravines, beautifully\r\nrepresented\r\nlittle coves and bays; and here and there a solitary hillock peeping up\r\nshowed that it had formerly stood there as an islet. The contrast of\r\nthese flat valleys and basins with the irregular mountains gave the\r\nscenery a character which to me was new and very interesting.\r\n\r\nFrom the natural slope to seaward of these plains, they are very easily\r\nirrigated, and in consequence singularly fertile. Without this process\r\nthe land would produce scarcely anything, for during the whole summer\r\nthe sky is cloudless. The mountains and hills are dotted over with\r\nbushes and low trees, and excepting these the vegetation is very\r\nscanty. Each landowner in the valley possesses a certain portion of\r\nhill-country, where his half-wild cattle, in considerable numbers,\r\nmanage to find sufficient pasture. Once every year there is a grand\r\n“rodeo,” when all the cattle are driven down, counted, and marked, and\r\na certain number separated to be fattened in the irrigated fields.\r\nWheat is extensively cultivated, and a good deal of Indian corn: a kind\r\nof bean is, however, the staple article of food for the common\r\nlabourers. The orchards produce an overflowing abundance of peaches,\r\nfigs, and grapes. With all these advantages the inhabitants of the\r\ncountry ought to be much more prosperous than they are.\r\n\r\n16_th._—The mayor-domo of the Hacienda was good enough to give me a\r\nguide and fresh horses; and in the morning we set out to ascend the\r\nCampana, or Bell Mountain, which is 6400 feet high. The paths were very\r\nbad, but both the geology and scenery amply repaid the trouble. We\r\nreached, by the evening, a spring called the Agua del Guanaco, which is\r\nsituated at a great height. This must be an old name, for it is very\r\nmany years since a guanaco drank its waters. During the ascent I\r\nnoticed that nothing but bushes grew on the northern slope, whilst on\r\nthe southern slope there was a bamboo about fifteen feet high. In a few\r\nplaces there were palms, and I was surprised to see one at an elevation\r\nof at least 4500 feet. These palms are, for their family, ugly trees.\r\nTheir stem is very large, and of a curious form, being thicker in the\r\nmiddle than at the base or top. They are excessively numerous in some\r\nparts of Chile, and valuable on account of a sort of treacle made from\r\nthe sap. On one estate near Petorca they tried to count them, but\r\nfailed, after having numbered several\r\nhundred thousand. Every year in the early spring, in August, very many\r\nare cut down, and when the trunk is lying on the ground, the crown of\r\nleaves is lopped off. The sap then immediately begins to flow from the\r\nupper end, and continues so doing for some months: it is, however,\r\nnecessary that a thin slice should be shaved off from that end every\r\nmorning, so as to expose a fresh surface. A good tree will give ninety\r\ngallons, and all this must have been contained in the vessels of the\r\napparently dry trunk. It is said that the sap flows much more quickly\r\non those days when the sun is powerful; and likewise, that it is\r\nabsolutely necessary to take care, in cutting down the tree, that it\r\nshould fall with its head upwards on the side of the hill; for if it\r\nfalls down the slope, scarcely any sap will flow; although in that case\r\none would have thought that the action would have been aided, instead\r\nof checked, by the force of gravity. The sap is concentrated by\r\nboiling, and is then called treacle, which it very much resembles in\r\ntaste.\r\n\r\nWe unsaddled our horses near the spring, and prepared to pass the\r\nnight. The evening was fine, and the atmosphere so clear that the masts\r\nof the vessels at anchor in the bay of Valparaiso, although no less\r\nthan twenty-six geographical miles distant, could be distinguished\r\nclearly as little black streaks. A ship doubling the point under sail\r\nappeared as a bright white speck. Anson expresses much surprise, in his\r\nvoyage, at the distance at which his vessels were discovered from the\r\ncoast; but he did not sufficiently allow for the height of the land and\r\nthe great transparency of the air.\r\n\r\nThe setting of the sun was glorious; the valleys being black, whilst\r\nthe snowy peaks of the Andes yet retained a ruby tint. When it was\r\ndark, we made a fire beneath a little arbour of bamboos, fried our\r\ncharqui (or dried slips of beef), took our maté, and were quite\r\ncomfortable. There is an inexpressible charm in thus living in the open\r\nair. The evening was calm and still;—the shrill noise of the mountain\r\nbizcacha, and the faint cry of a goatsucker, were occasionally to be\r\nheard. Besides these, few birds, or even insects, frequent these dry,\r\nparched mountains.\r\n\r\n\r\n_August_ 17_th._—In the morning we climbed up the rough mass of\r\ngreenstone which crowns the summit. This rock, as\r\nfrequently happens, was much shattered and broken into huge angular\r\nfragments. I observed, however, one remarkable circumstance, namely,\r\nthat many of the surfaces presented every degree of freshness—some\r\nappearing as if broken the day before, whilst on others lichens had\r\neither just become, or had long grown, attached. I so fully believed\r\nthat this was owing to the frequent earthquakes, that I felt inclined\r\nto hurry from below each loose pile. As one might very easily be\r\ndeceived in a fact of this kind, I doubted its accuracy, until\r\nascending Mount Wellington, in Van Diemen’s Land, where earthquakes do\r\nnot occur; and there I saw the summit of the mountain similarly\r\ncomposed and similarly shattered, but all the blocks appeared as if\r\nthey had been hurled into their present position thousands of years\r\nago.\r\n\r\nWe spent the day on the summit, and I never enjoyed one more\r\nthoroughly. Chile, bounded by the Andes and the Pacific, was seen as in\r\na map. The pleasure from the scenery, in itself beautiful, was\r\nheightened by the many reflections which arose from the mere view of\r\nthe Campana range with its lesser parallel ones, and of the broad\r\nvalley of Quillota directly intersecting them. Who can avoid wondering\r\nat the force which has upheaved these mountains, and even more so at\r\nthe countless ages which it must have required to have broken through,\r\nremoved, and levelled whole masses of them? It is well in this case to\r\ncall to mind the vast shingle and sedimentary beds of Patagonia, which,\r\nif heaped on the Cordillera, would increase its height by so many\r\nthousand feet. When in that country, I wondered how any mountain-chain\r\ncould have supplied such masses, and not have been utterly obliterated.\r\nWe must not now reverse the wonder, and doubt whether all-powerful time\r\ncan grind down mountains—even the gigantic Cordillera—into gravel and\r\nmud.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of the Andes was different from that which I had\r\nexpected. The lower line of the snow was of course horizontal, and to\r\nthis line the even summits of the range seemed quite parallel. Only at\r\nlong intervals a group of points or a single cone showed where a\r\nvolcano had existed, or does now exist. Hence the range resembled a\r\ngreat solid wall, surmounted here and there by a tower, and making a\r\nmost perfect barrier to the country.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlmost every part of the hill had been drilled by attempts to open\r\ngold-mines: the rage for mining has left scarcely a spot in Chile\r\nunexamined. I spent the evening as before, talking round the fire with\r\nmy two companions. The Guasos of Chile, who correspond to the Gauchos\r\nof the Pampas, are, however, a very different set of beings. Chile is\r\nthe more civilised of the two countries, and the inhabitants, in\r\nconsequence, have lost much individual character. Gradations in rank\r\nare much more strongly marked: the Guaso does not by any means consider\r\nevery man his equal; and I was quite surprised to find that my\r\ncompanions did not like to eat at the same time with myself. This\r\nfeeling of inequality is a necessary consequence of the existence of an\r\naristocracy of wealth. It is said that some few of the greater\r\nlandowners possess from five to ten thousand pounds sterling per annum:\r\nan inequality of riches which I believe is not met with in any of the\r\ncattle-breeding countries eastward of the Andes. A traveller does not\r\nhere meet that unbounded hospitality which refuses all payment, but yet\r\nis so kindly offered that no scruples can be raised in accepting it.\r\nAlmost every house in Chile will receive you for the night, but a\r\ntrifle is expected to be given in the morning; even a rich man will\r\naccept two or three shillings. The Gaucho, although he may be a\r\ncutthroat, is a gentleman; the Guaso is in few respects better, but at\r\nthe same time a vulgar, ordinary fellow. The two men, although employed\r\nmuch in the same manner, are different in their habits and attire; and\r\nthe peculiarities of each are universal in their respective countries.\r\nThe Gaucho seems part of his horse, and scorns to exert himself\r\nexcepting when on its back; the Guaso may be hired to work as a\r\nlabourer in the fields. The former lives entirely on animal food; the\r\nlatter almost wholly on vegetable. We do not here see the white boots,\r\nthe broad drawers, and scarlet chilipa; the picturesque costume of the\r\nPampas. Here, common trousers are protected by black and green worsted\r\nleggings. The poncho, however, is common to both. The chief pride of\r\nthe Guaso lies in his spurs, which are absurdly large. I measured one\r\nwhich was six inches in the _diameter_ of the rowel, and the rowel\r\nitself contained upwards of thirty points. The stirrups are on the same\r\nscale, each consisting of a square, carved\r\nblock of wood, hollowed out, yet weighing three or four pounds. The\r\nGuaso is perhaps more expert with the lazo than the Gaucho; but, from\r\nthe nature of the country, he does not know the use of the bolas.\r\n\r\n\r\n_August_ 18_th._—We descended the mountain, and passed some beautiful\r\nlittle spots, with rivulets and fine trees. Having slept at the same\r\nhacienda as before, we rode during the two succeeding days up the\r\nvalley, and passed through Quillota, which is more like a collection of\r\nnursery-gardens than a town. The orchards were beautiful, presenting\r\none mass of peach-blossoms. I saw, also, in one or two places the\r\ndate-palm; it is a most stately tree; and I should think a group of\r\nthem in their native Asiatic or African deserts must be superb. We\r\npassed likewise San Felipe, a pretty straggling town like Quillota. The\r\nvalley in this part expands into one of those great bays or plains,\r\nreaching to the foot of the Cordillera, which have been mentioned as\r\nforming so curious a part of the scenery of Chile. In the evening we\r\nreached the mines of Jajuel, situated in a ravine at the flank of the\r\ngreat chain. I stayed here five days. My host, the superintendent of\r\nthe mine, was a shrewd but rather ignorant Cornish miner. He had\r\nmarried a Spanish woman, and did not mean to return home; but his\r\nadmiration for the mines of Cornwall remained unbounded. Amongst many\r\nother questions, he asked me, “Now that George Rex is dead, how many\r\nmore of the family of Rexes are yet alive?” This Rex certainly must be\r\na relation of the great author Finis, who wrote all books!\r\n\r\nThese mines are of copper, and the ore is all shipped to Swansea, to be\r\nsmelted. Hence the mines have an aspect singularly quiet, as compared\r\nto those in England: here no smoke, furnaces, or great steam-engines,\r\ndisturb the solitude of the surrounding mountains.\r\n\r\nThe Chilian government, or rather the old Spanish law, encourages by\r\nevery method the searching for mines. The discoverer may work a mine on\r\nany ground, by paying five shillings; and before paying this he may\r\ntry, even in the garden of another man, for twenty days.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt is now well known that the Chilian method of mining is the cheapest.\r\nMy host says that the two principal\r\nimprovements introduced by foreigners have been, first, reducing by\r\nprevious roasting the copper pyrites—which, being the common ore in\r\nCornwall, the English miners were astounded on their arrival to find\r\nthrown away as useless: secondly, stamping and washing the scoriæ from\r\nthe old furnaces—by which process particles of metal are recovered in\r\nabundance. I have actually seen mules carrying to the coast, for\r\ntransportation to England, a cargo of such cinders. But the first case\r\nis much the most curious. The Chilian miners were so convinced that\r\ncopper pyrites contained not a particle of copper, that they laughed at\r\nthe Englishmen for their ignorance, who laughed in turn, and bought\r\ntheir richest veins for a few dollars. It is very odd that, in a\r\ncountry where mining had been extensively carried on for many years, so\r\nsimple a process as gently roasting the ore to expel the sulphur\r\nprevious to smelting it, had never been discovered. A few improvements\r\nhave likewise been introduced in some of the simple machinery; but even\r\nto the present day, water is removed from some mines by men carrying it\r\nup the shaft in leathern bags!\r\n\r\nThe labouring men work very hard. They have little time allowed for\r\ntheir meals, and during summer and winter they begin when it is light,\r\nand leave off at dark. They are paid one pound sterling a month, and\r\ntheir food is given them: this for breakfast consists of sixteen figs\r\nand two small loaves of bread; for dinner, boiled beans; for supper,\r\nbroken roasted wheat grain. They scarcely ever taste meat; as, with the\r\ntwelve pounds per annum, they have to clothe themselves and support\r\ntheir families. The miners who work in the mine itself have twenty-five\r\nshillings per month, and are allowed\r\na little charqui. But these men come down from their bleak habitations\r\nonly once in every fortnight or three weeks.\r\n\r\nCactus; Cereus Peruviana\r\n\r\nDuring my stay here I thoroughly enjoyed scrambling about these huge\r\nmountains. The geology, as might have been expected, was very\r\ninteresting. The shattered and baked rocks, traversed by innumerable\r\ndikes of greenstone, showed what commotions had formerly taken place.\r\nThe scenery was much the same as that near the Bell of Quillota—dry\r\nbarren mountains, dotted at intervals by bushes with a scanty foliage.\r\nThe cactuses, or rather opuntias, were here very numerous. I measured\r\none of a spherical figure, which, including the spines, was six feet\r\nand four inches in circumference. The height of the common cylindrical,\r\nbranching kind, is from twelve to fifteen feet, and the girth (with\r\nspines) of the branches between three and four feet.\r\n\r\nA heavy fall of snow on the mountains prevented me, during the last two\r\ndays, from making some interesting excursions. I attempted to reach a\r\nlake which the inhabitants, from some\r\nunaccountable reason, believe to be an arm of the sea. During a very\r\ndry season, it was proposed to attempt cutting a channel from it for\r\nthe sake of the water, but the padre, after a consultation, declared it\r\nwas too dangerous, as all Chile would be inundated, if, as generally\r\nsupposed, the lake was connected with the Pacific. We ascended to a\r\ngreat height, but becoming involved in the snow-drifts failed in\r\nreaching this wonderful lake, and had some difficulty in returning. I\r\nthought we should have lost our horses; for there was no means of\r\nguessing how deep the drifts were, and the animals, when led, could\r\nonly move by jumping. The black sky showed that a fresh snowstorm was\r\ngathering, and we therefore were not a little glad when we escaped. By\r\nthe time we reached the base the storm commenced, and it was lucky for\r\nus that this did not happen three hours earlier in the day.\r\n\r\n\r\n_August_ 26_th._—We left Jajuel and again crossed the basin of San\r\nFelipe. The day was truly Chilian: glaringly bright, and the atmosphere\r\nquite clear. The thick and uniform covering of newly-fallen snow\r\nrendered the view of the volcano of Aconcagua and the main chain quite\r\nglorious. We were now on the road to Santiago, the capital of Chile. We\r\ncrossed the Cerro del Talguen, and slept at a little rancho. The host,\r\ntalking about the state of Chile as compared to other countries, was\r\nvery humble: “Some see with two eyes, and some with one, but for my\r\npart I do not think that Chile sees with any.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_August_ 27_th._—After crossing many low hills we descended into the\r\nsmall land-locked plain of Guitron. In the basins, such as this one,\r\nwhich are elevated from one thousand to two thousand feet above the\r\nsea, two species of acacia, which are stunted in their forms, and stand\r\nwide apart from each other, grow in large numbers. These trees are\r\nnever found near the sea-coast; and this gives another characteristic\r\nfeature to the scenery of these basins. We crossed a low ridge which\r\nseparates Guitron from the great plain on which Santiago stands. The\r\nview was here pre-eminently striking: the dead level surface, covered\r\nin parts by woods of acacia, and with the city in the distance,\r\nabutting horizontally against the base of the Andes,\r\nwhose snowy peaks were bright with the evening sun. At the first glance\r\nof this view, it was quite evident that the plain represented the\r\nextent of a former inland sea. As soon as we gained the level road we\r\npushed our horses into a gallop, and reached the city before it was\r\ndark.\r\n\r\nI stayed a week in Santiago and enjoyed myself very much. In the\r\nmorning I rode to various places on the plain, and in the evening dined\r\nwith several of the English merchants, whose hospitality at this place\r\nis well known. A never-failing source of pleasure was to ascend the\r\nlittle hillock of rock (St. Lucia) which projects in the middle of the\r\ncity. The scenery certainly is most striking, and, as I have said, very\r\npeculiar. I am informed that this same character is common to the\r\ncities on the great Mexican platform. Of the town I have nothing to say\r\nin detail: it is not so fine or so large as Buenos Ayres, but is built\r\nafter the same model. I arrived here by a circuit to the north; so I\r\nresolved to return to Valparaiso by a rather longer excursion to the\r\nsouth of the direct road.\r\n\r\n\r\n_September_ 5_th._—By the middle of the day we arrived at one of the\r\nsuspension bridges made of hide, which cross the Maypu, a large\r\nturbulent river a few leagues southward of Santiago. These bridges are\r\nvery poor affairs. The road, following the curvature of the suspending\r\nropes, is made of bundles of sticks placed close together. It was full\r\nof holes, and oscillated rather fearfully, even with the weight of a\r\nman leading his horse. In the evening we reached a comfortable\r\nfarm-house, where there were several very pretty señoritas. They were\r\nmuch horrified at my having entered one of their churches out of mere\r\ncuriosity. They asked me, “Why do you not become a Christian—for our\r\nreligion is certain?” I assured them I was a sort of Christian; but\r\nthey would not hear of it—appealing to my own words, “Do not your\r\npadres, your very bishops, marry?” The absurdity of a bishop having a\r\nwife particularly struck them: they scarcely knew whether to be most\r\namused or horror-struck at such an enormity.\r\n\r\n\r\n6_th._—We proceeded due south, and slept at Rancagua. The road passed\r\nover the level but narrow plain, bounded on\r\none side by lofty hills, and on the other by the Cordillera. The next\r\nday we turned up the valley of the Rio Cachapual, in which the\r\nhot-baths of Cauquenes, long celebrated for their medicinal properties,\r\nare situated. The suspension bridges, in the less frequented parts, are\r\ngenerally taken down during the winter when the rivers are low. Such\r\nwas the case in this valley, and we were therefore obliged to cross the\r\nstream on horseback. This is rather disagreeable, for the foaming\r\nwater, though not deep, rushes so quickly over the bed of large rounded\r\nstones, that one’s head becomes quite confused, and it is difficult\r\neven to perceive whether the horse is moving onward or standing still.\r\nIn summer, when the snow melts, the torrents are quite impassable;\r\ntheir strength and fury are then extremely great, as might be plainly\r\nseen by the marks which they had left. We reached the baths in the\r\nevening, and stayed there five days, being confined the two last by\r\nheavy rain. The buildings consist of a square of miserable little\r\nhovels, each with a single table and bench. They are situated in a\r\nnarrow deep valley just without the central Cordillera. It is a quiet,\r\nsolitary spot, with a good deal of wild beauty.\r\n\r\nThe mineral springs of Cauquenes burst forth on a line of dislocation,\r\ncrossing a mass of stratified rock, the whole of which betrays the\r\naction of heat. A considerable quantity of gas is continually escaping\r\nfrom the same orifices with the water. Though the springs are only a\r\nfew yards apart, they have very different temperatures; and this\r\nappears to be the result of an unequal mixture of cold water: for those\r\nwith the lowest temperature have scarcely any mineral taste. After the\r\ngreat earthquake of 1822 the springs ceased, and the water did not\r\nreturn for nearly a year. They were also much affected by the\r\nearthquake of 1835; the temperature being suddenly changed from 118° to\r\n92°.[1] It seems probable that mineral waters rising deep from the\r\nbowels of the earth would always be more deranged by subterranean\r\ndisturbances than those nearer the surface. The man who had charge of\r\nthe baths assured me that in summer the water is hotter and more\r\nplentiful than in winter. The former circumstance I should have\r\nexpected, from the less mixture, during the dry season, of cold water;\r\nbut the latter statement appears very strange and contradictory. The\r\nperiodical increase during the summer, when rain never falls, can, I\r\nthink, only be accounted for by the melting of the snow: yet the\r\nmountains which are covered by snow during that season are three or\r\nfour leagues distant from the springs. I have no reason to doubt the\r\naccuracy of my informer, who, having lived on the spot for several\r\nyears, ought to be well acquainted with the circumstance,—which, if\r\ntrue, certainly is very curious: for we must suppose that the\r\nsnow-water, being conducted through porous strata to the regions of\r\nheat, is again thrown up to the surface by the line of dislocated and\r\ninjected rocks at Cauquenes; and the regularity of the phenomenon would\r\nseem to indicate that in this district heated rock occurred at a depth\r\nnot very great.\r\n\r\n [1] Caldcleugh, in _Philosoph. Transact._ for 1836.\r\n\r\nOne day I rode up the valley to the farthest inhabited spot. Shortly\r\nabove that point, the Cachapual divides into two deep tremendous\r\nravines, which penetrate directly into the great range. I scrambled up\r\na peaked mountain, probably more than six thousand feet high. Here, as\r\nindeed everywhere else, scenes of the highest interest presented\r\nthemselves. It was by one of these ravines that Pincheira entered Chile\r\nand ravaged the neighbouring country. This is the same man whose attack\r\non an estancia at the Rio Negro I have described. He was a renegade\r\nhalf-caste Spaniard, who collected a great body of Indians together and\r\nestablished himself by a stream in the Pampas, which place none of the\r\nforces sent after him could ever discover. From this point he used to\r\nsally forth, and crossing the Cordillera by passes hitherto\r\nunattempted, he ravaged the farm-houses and drove the cattle to his\r\nsecret rendezvous. Pincheira was a capital horseman, and he made all\r\naround him equally good, for he invariably shot any one who hesitated\r\nto follow him. It was against this man, and other wandering Indian\r\ntribes, that Rosas waged the war of extermination.\r\n\r\nCordilleras from Santiago de Chile\r\n\r\n\r\n_September_ 13_th._—We left the baths of Cauquenes, and, rejoining the\r\nmain road, slept at the Rio Claro. From this place we rode to the town\r\nof San Fernando. Before arriving there, the last land-locked basin had\r\nexpanded into a great plain, which extended so far to the south that\r\nthe snowy summits of the more distant Andes were seen as if above the\r\nhorizon of the sea. San Fernando is forty leagues from Santiago; and it\r\nwas my\r\nfarthest point southward; for we here turned at right angles towards\r\nthe coast. We slept at the gold-mines of Yaquil, which are worked by\r\nMr. Nixon, an American gentleman, to whose kindness I was much indebted\r\nduring the four days I stayed at his house. The next morning we rode to\r\nthe mines, which are situated at the distance of some leagues, near the\r\nsummit of a lofty hill. On the way we had a glimpse of the lake\r\nTagua-tagua, celebrated for its floating islands, which have been\r\ndescribed by M. Gay.[2] They are composed of the stalks of various dead\r\nplants intertwined together, and on the surface of which other living\r\nones take root. Their form is generally circular, and their thickness\r\nfrom four to six feet, of which the greater part is immersed in the\r\nwater. As the wind blows, they pass from one side of the lake to the\r\nother, and often carry cattle and horses as passengers.\r\n\r\n [2] _Annales des Sciences Naturelles_, March, 1833. M. Gay, a zealous\r\n and able naturalist, was then occupied in studying every branch of\r\n natural history throughout the kingdom of Chile.\r\n\r\nWhen we arrived at the mine, I was struck by the pale appearance of\r\nmany of the men, and inquired from Mr. Nixon respecting their\r\ncondition. The mine is 450 feet deep, and each man brings up about 200\r\npounds weight of stone. With this load they have to climb up the\r\nalternate notches cut in the trunks of trees, placed in a zigzag line\r\nup the shaft. Even beardless young men, eighteen and twenty years old,\r\nwith little muscular development of their bodies (they are quite naked\r\nexcepting drawers) ascend with this great load from nearly the same\r\ndepth. A strong man, who is not accustomed to this labour, perspires\r\nmost profusely, with merely carrying up his own body. With this very\r\nsevere labour, they live entirely on boiled beans and bread. They would\r\nprefer having bread alone; but their masters, finding that they cannot\r\nwork so hard upon this, treat them like horses, and make them eat the\r\nbeans. Their pay is here rather more than at the mines of Jajuel, being\r\nfrom 24 to 28 shillings per month. They leave the mine only once in\r\nthree weeks; when they stay with their families for two days. One of\r\nthe rules of this mine sounds very harsh, but answers pretty well for\r\nthe master. The only method of stealing gold is to secrete pieces of\r\nthe ore, and take them out as occasion may offer. Whenever the\r\nmajor-domo\r\nfinds a lump thus hidden, its full value is stopped out of the wages of\r\nall the men; who thus, without they all combine, are obliged to keep\r\nwatch over each other.\r\n\r\nWhen the ore is brought to the mill, it is ground into an impalpable\r\npowder; the process of washing removes all the lighter particles, and\r\namalgamation finally secures the gold-dust. The washing, when\r\ndescribed, sounds a very simple process; but it is beautiful to see how\r\nthe exact adaptation of the current of water to the specific gravity of\r\nthe gold so easily separates the powdered matrix from the metal. The\r\nmud which passes from the mills is collected into pools, where it\r\nsubsides, and every now and then is cleared out, and thrown into a\r\ncommon heap. A great deal of chemical action then commences, salts of\r\nvarious kinds effloresce on the surface, and the mass becomes hard.\r\nAfter having been left for a year or two, and then rewashed, it yields\r\ngold; and this process may be repeated even six or seven times; but the\r\ngold each time becomes less in quantity, and the intervals required (as\r\nthe inhabitants say, to generate the metal) are longer. There can be no\r\ndoubt that the chemical action, already mentioned, each time liberates\r\nfresh gold from some combination. The discovery of a method to effect\r\nthis before the first grinding would without doubt raise the value of\r\ngold-ores many fold. It is curious to find how the minute particles of\r\ngold, being scattered about and not corroding, at last accumulate in\r\nsome quantity. A short time since a few miners, being out of work,\r\nobtained permission to scrape the ground round the house and mill; they\r\nwashed the earth thus got together, and so procured thirty dollars\r\nworth of gold. This is an exact counterpart of what takes place in\r\nnature. Mountains suffer degradation and wear away, and with them the\r\nmetallic veins which they contain. The hardest rock is worn into\r\nimpalpable mud, the ordinary metals oxidate, and both are removed; but\r\ngold, platina, and a few others are nearly indestructible, and from\r\ntheir weight, sinking to the bottom, are left behind. After whole\r\nmountains have passed through this grinding mill, and have been washed\r\nby the hand of nature, the residue becomes metalliferous, and man finds\r\nit worth his while to complete the task of separation.\r\n\r\nBad as the above treatment of the miners appears, it is\r\ngladly accepted of by them; for the condition of the labouring\r\nagriculturists is much worse. Their wages are lower, and they live\r\nalmost exclusively on beans. This poverty must be chiefly owing to the\r\nfeudal-like system on which the land is tilled: the landowner gives a\r\nsmall plot of ground to the labourer, for building on and cultivating,\r\nand in return has his services (or those of a proxy) for every day of\r\nhis life, without any wages. Until a father has a grown-up son, who can\r\nby his labour pay the rent, there is no one, except on occasional days,\r\nto take care of his own patch of ground. Hence extreme poverty is very\r\ncommon among the labouring classes in this country.\r\n\r\nThere are some old Indian ruins in this neighbourhood, and I was shown\r\none of the perforated stones, which Molina mentions as being found in\r\nmany places in considerable numbers. They are of a circular flattened\r\nform, from five to six inches in diameter, with a hole passing quite\r\nthrough the centre. It has generally been supposed that they were used\r\nas heads to clubs, although their form does not appear at all well\r\nadapted for that purpose. Burchell[3] states that some of the tribes in\r\nSouthern Africa dig up roots by the aid of a stick pointed at one end,\r\nthe force and weight of which are increased by a round stone with a\r\nhole in it, into which the other end is firmly wedged. It appears\r\nprobable that the Indians of Chile formerly used some such rude\r\nagricultural instrument.\r\n\r\n [3] Burchell’s _Travels_, vol. ii, p. 45.\r\n\r\nOne day, a German collector in natural history, of the name of Renous,\r\ncalled, and nearly at the same time an old Spanish lawyer. I was amused\r\nat being told the conversation which took place between them. Renous\r\nspeaks Spanish so well that the old lawyer mistook him for a Chilian.\r\nRenous alluding to me, asked him what he thought of the King of England\r\nsending out a collector to their country, to pick up lizards and\r\nbeetles, and to break stones? The old gentleman thought seriously for\r\nsome time, and then said, “It is not well,—_hay un gato encerrado aqui_\r\n(there is a cat shut up here). No man is so rich as to send out people\r\nto pick up such rubbish. I do not like it: if one of us were to go and\r\ndo such things in England, do not you think the King of England would\r\nvery soon send us out of his country?” And this old gentleman, from\r\nhis profession, belongs to the better informed and more intelligent\r\nclasses! Renous himself, two or three years before, left in a house at\r\nSan Fernando some caterpillars, under charge of a girl to feed, that\r\nthey might turn into butterflies. This was rumoured through the town,\r\nand at last the Padres and Governor consulted together, and agreed it\r\nmust be some heresy. Accordingly, when Renous returned, he was\r\narrested.\r\n\r\n\r\n_September_ 19_th._—We left Yaquil, and followed the flat valley,\r\nformed like that of Quillota, in which the Rio Tinderidica flows. Even\r\nat these few miles south of Santiago the climate is much damper; in\r\nconsequence there were fine tracts of pasturage which were not\r\nirrigated. (_20th._) We followed this valley till it expanded into a\r\ngreat plain, which reaches from the sea to the mountains west of\r\nRancagua. We shortly lost all trees and even bushes; so that the\r\ninhabitants are nearly as badly off for firewood as those in the\r\nPampas. Never having heard of these plains, I was much surprised at\r\nmeeting with such scenery in Chile. The plains belong to more than one\r\nseries of different elevations, and they are traversed by broad\r\nflat-bottomed valleys; both of which circumstances, as in Patagonia,\r\nbespeak the action of the sea on gently rising land. In the steep\r\ncliffs bordering these valleys there are some large caves, which no\r\ndoubt were originally formed by the waves: one of these is celebrated\r\nunder the name of Cueva del Obispo; having formerly been consecrated.\r\nDuring the day I felt very unwell, and from that time till the end of\r\nOctober did not recover.\r\n\r\n\r\n_September_ 22_nd._—We continued to pass over green plains without a\r\ntree. The next day we arrived at a house near Navedad, on the\r\nsea-coast, where a rich Haciendero gave us lodgings. I stayed here the\r\ntwo ensuing days, and although very unwell, managed to collect from the\r\ntertiary formation some marine shells.\r\n\r\n\r\n24_th._—Our course was now directed towards Valparaiso, which with\r\ngreat difficulty I reached on the 27th, and was there confined to my\r\nbed till the end of October. During this\r\ntime I was an inmate in Mr. Corfield’s house, whose kindness to me I do\r\nnot know how to express.\r\n\r\n\r\nI will here add a few observations on some of the animals and birds of\r\nChile. The Puma, or South American Lion, is not uncommon. This animal\r\nhas a wide geographical range; being found from the equatorial forests,\r\nthroughout the deserts of Patagonia, as far south as the damp and cold\r\nlatitudes (53° to 54°) of Tierra del Fuego. I have seen its footsteps\r\nin the Cordillera of central Chile, at an elevation of at least 10,000\r\nfeet. In La Plata the puma preys chiefly on deer, ostriches, bizcacha,\r\nand other small quadrupeds; it there seldom attacks cattle or horses,\r\nand most rarely man. In Chile, however, it destroys many young horses\r\nand cattle, owing probably to the scarcity of other quadrupeds: I\r\nheard, likewise, of two men and a woman who had been thus killed. It is\r\nasserted that the puma always kills its prey by springing on the\r\nshoulders, and then drawing back the head with one of its paws, until\r\nthe vertebræ break: I have seen in Patagonia the skeletons of guanacos,\r\nwith their necks thus dislocated.\r\n\r\nThe puma, after eating its fill, covers the carcass with many large\r\nbushes, and lies down to watch it. This habit is often the cause of its\r\nbeing discovered; for the condors wheeling in the air, every now and\r\nthen descend to partake of the feast, and being angrily driven away,\r\nrise all together on the wing. The Chileno Guaso then knows there is a\r\nlion watching his prey—the word is given—and men and dogs hurry to the\r\nchase. Sir F. Head says that a Gaucho in the Pampas, upon merely seeing\r\nsome condors wheeling in the air, cried “A lion!” I could never myself\r\nmeet with any one who pretended to such powers of discrimination. It is\r\nasserted that if a puma has once been betrayed by thus watching the\r\ncarcass, and has then been hunted, it never resumes this habit; but\r\nthat having gorged itself, it wanders far away. The puma is easily\r\nkilled. In an open country it is first entangled with the bolas, then\r\nlazoed, and dragged along the ground till rendered insensible. At\r\nTandeel (south of the Plata), I was told that within three months one\r\nhundred were thus destroyed. In Chile they are generally driven up\r\nbushes or trees, and are then either shot, or baited to death by dogs.\r\nThe dogs employed in this chase\r\nbelong to a particular breed, called Leoneros: they are weak, slight\r\nanimals, like long-legged terriers, but are born with a particular\r\ninstinct for this sport. The puma is described as being very crafty:\r\nwhen pursued, it often returns on its former track, and then suddenly\r\nmaking a spring on one side, waits there till the dogs have passed by.\r\nIt is a very silent animal, uttering no cry even when wounded, and only\r\nrarely during the breeding season.\r\n\r\nOf birds, two species of the genus Pteroptochos (megapodius and\r\nalbicollis of Kittlitz) are perhaps the most conspicuous. The former,\r\ncalled by the Chilenos “el Turco,” is as large as a fieldfare, to which\r\nbird it has some alliance; but its legs are much longer, tail shorter,\r\nand beak stronger: its colour is a reddish brown. The Turco is not\r\nuncommon. It lives on the ground, sheltered among the thickets which\r\nare scattered over the dry and sterile hills. With its tail erect, and\r\nstilt-like legs, it may be seen every now and then popping from one\r\nbush to another with uncommon quickness. It really requires little\r\nimagination to believe that the bird is ashamed of itself, and is aware\r\nof its most ridiculous figure. On first seeing it, one is tempted to\r\nexclaim, “A vilely stuffed specimen has escaped from some museum, and\r\nhas come to life again!” It cannot be made to take flight without the\r\ngreatest trouble, nor does it run, but only hops. The various loud\r\ncries which it utters when concealed amongst the bushes are as strange\r\nas its appearance. It is said to build its nest in a deep hole beneath\r\nthe ground. I dissected several specimens: the gizzard, which was very\r\nmuscular, contained beetles, vegetable fibres, and pebbles. From this\r\ncharacter, from the length of its legs, scratching feet, membranous\r\ncovering to the nostrils, short and arched wings, this bird seems in a\r\ncertain degree to connect the thrushes with the gallinaceous order.\r\n\r\nThe second species (or P. albicollis) is allied to the first in its\r\ngeneral form. It is called Tapacolo, or “cover your posterior;” and\r\nwell does the shameless little bird deserve its name; for it carries\r\nits tail more than erect, that is, inclined backwards towards its head.\r\nIt is very common, and frequents the bottoms of hedgerows, and the\r\nbushes scattered over the barren hills, where scarcely another bird can\r\nexist. In its general manner of feeding, of quickly hopping out of the\r\nthickets\r\nand back again, in its desire of concealment, unwillingness to take\r\nflight, and nidification, it bears a close resemblance to the Turco;\r\nbut its appearance is not quite so ridiculous. The Tapacolo is very\r\ncrafty: when frightened by any person, it will remain motionless at the\r\nbottom of a bush, and will then, after a little while, try with much\r\naddress to crawl away on the opposite side. It is also an active bird,\r\nand continually making a noise: these noises are various and strangely\r\nodd; some are like the cooing of doves, others like the bubbling of\r\nwater, and many defy all similes. The country people say it changes its\r\ncry five times in the year—according to some change of season, I\r\nsuppose.[4]\r\n\r\n [4] It is a remarkable fact that Molina, though describing in detail\r\n all the birds and animals of Chile, never once mentions this genus,\r\n the species of which are so common, and so remarkable in their habits.\r\n Was he at a loss how to classify them, and did he consequently think\r\n that silence was the more prudent course? It is one more instance of\r\n the frequency of omissions by authors on those very subjects where it\r\n might have been least expected.\r\n\r\nTwo species of humming-birds are common; Trochilus forficatus is found\r\nover a space of 2500 miles on the west coast, from the hot dry country\r\nof Lima to the forests of Tierra del Fuego—where it may be seen\r\nflitting about in snow-storms. In the wooded island of Chiloe, which\r\nhas an extremely humid climate, this little bird, skipping from side to\r\nside amidst the dripping foliage, is perhaps more abundant than almost\r\nany other kind. I opened the stomachs of several specimens, shot in\r\ndifferent parts of the continent, and in all, remains of insects were\r\nas numerous as in the stomach of a creeper. When this species migrates\r\nin the summer southward, it is replaced by the arrival of another\r\nspecies coming from the north. This second kind (Trochilus gigas) is a\r\nvery large bird for the delicate family to which it belongs: when on\r\nthe wing its appearance is singular. Like others of the genus, it moves\r\nfrom place to place with a rapidity which may be compared to that of\r\nSyrphus amongst flies, and Sphinx among moths; but whilst hovering over\r\na flower, it flaps its wings with a very slow and powerful movement,\r\ntotally different from that vibratory one common to most of the\r\nspecies, which produces the humming noise. I never saw any other bird\r\nwhere the force of its wings appeared (as in a butterfly) so powerful\r\nin proportion to the weight of its body. When hovering by a flower, its\r\ntail is constantly expanded and shut like a fan, the\r\nbody being kept in a nearly vertical position. This action appears to\r\nsteady and support the bird, between the slow movements of its wings.\r\nAlthough flying from flower to flower in search of food, its stomach\r\ngenerally contained abundant remains of insects, which I suspect are\r\nmuch more the object of its search than honey. The note of this\r\nspecies, like that of nearly the whole family, is extremely shrill.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Chilian spurs, stirrup, etc.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Old Church, Castro, Chiloe]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIII\r\n\r\n\r\nChiloe—General Aspect—Boat excursion—Native Indians—Castro—Tame\r\nfox—Ascend San Pedro—Chonos Archipelago—Peninsula of Tres\r\nMontes—Granitic range—Boat-wrecked sailors—Low’s Harbour—Wild\r\npotato—Formation of peat—Myopotamus, otter and mice—Cheucau and\r\nBarking-bird—Opetiorhynchus—Singular character of ornithology—Petrels.\r\n\r\nCHILOE AND CHONOS ISLANDS\r\n\r\n_November_ 10_th._—The _Beagle_ sailed from Valparaiso to the south,\r\nfor the purpose of surveying the southern part of Chile, the island of\r\nChiloe, and the broken land called the Chonos Archipelago, as far south\r\nas the Peninsula of Tres Montes. On the 21st we anchored in the bay of\r\nS. Carlos, the capital of Chiloe.\r\n\r\nThis island is about ninety miles long, with a breadth of rather less\r\nthan thirty. The land is hilly, but not mountainous, and is covered by\r\none great forest, except where a few green patches have been cleared\r\nround the thatched cottages. From\r\na distance the view somewhat resembles that of Tierra del Fuego; but\r\nthe woods, when seen nearer, are incomparably more beautiful. Many\r\nkinds of fine evergreen trees, and plants with a tropical character,\r\nhere take the place of the gloomy beech of the southern shores. In\r\nwinter the climate is detestable, and in summer it is only a little\r\nbetter. I should think there are few parts of the world, within the\r\ntemperate regions, where so much rain falls. The winds are very\r\nboisterous, and the sky almost always clouded: to have a week of fine\r\nweather is something wonderful. It is even difficult to get a single\r\nglimpse of the Cordillera: during our first visit, once only the\r\nvolcano of Osorno stood out in bold relief, and that was before\r\nsunrise; it was curious to watch, as the sun rose, the outline\r\ngradually fading away in the glare of the eastern sky.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants, from their complexion and low stature, appear to have\r\nthree-fourths of Indian blood in their veins. They are an humble,\r\nquiet, industrious set of men. Although the fertile soil, resulting\r\nfrom the decomposition of the volcanic rocks, supports a rank\r\nvegetation, yet the climate is not favourable to any production which\r\nrequires much sunshine to ripen it. There is very little pasture for\r\nthe larger quadrupeds; and in consequence, the staple articles of food\r\nare pigs, potatoes, and fish. The people all dress in strong woollen\r\ngarments, which each family makes for itself, and dyes with indigo of a\r\ndark blue colour. The arts, however, are in the rudest state;—as may be\r\nseen in their strange fashion of ploughing, their method of spinning,\r\ngrinding corn, and in the construction of their boats. The forests are\r\nso impenetrable that the land is nowhere cultivated except near the\r\ncoast and on the adjoining islets. Even where paths exist, they are\r\nscarcely passable from the soft and swampy state of the soil. The\r\ninhabitants, like those of Tierra del Fuego, move about chiefly on the\r\nbeach or in boats. Although with plenty to eat, the people are very\r\npoor: there is no demand for labour, and consequently the lower orders\r\ncannot scrape together money sufficient to purchase even the smallest\r\nluxuries. There is also a great deficiency of a circulating medium. I\r\nhave seen a man bringing on his back a bag of charcoal, with which to\r\nbuy some trifle, and another carrying a plank to exchange for a bottle\r\nof wine. Hence every tradesman must also be\r\na merchant, and again sell the goods which he takes in exchange.\r\n\r\n_November_ 24_th._—The yawl and whale-boat were sent under the command\r\nof Mr. (now Captain) Sulivan to survey the eastern or inland coast of\r\nChiloe; and with orders to meet the _ Beagle_ at the southern extremity\r\nof the island; to which point she would proceed by the outside, so as\r\nthus to circumnavigate the whole. I accompanied this expedition, but\r\ninstead of going in the boats the first day, I hired horses to take me\r\nto Chacao, at the northern extremity of the island. The road followed\r\nthe coast; every now and then crossing promontories covered by fine\r\nforests. In these shaded paths it is absolutely necessary that the\r\nwhole road should be made of logs of wood, which are squared and placed\r\nby the side of each other. From the rays of the sun never penetrating\r\nthe evergreen foliage, the ground is so damp and soft, that except by\r\nthis means neither man nor horse would be able to pass along. I arrived\r\nat the village of Chacao shortly after the tents belonging to the boats\r\nwere pitched for the night.\r\n\r\nThe land in this neighbourhood has been extensively cleared, and there\r\nwere many quiet and most picturesque nooks in the forest. Chacao was\r\nformerly the principal port in the island; but many vessels having been\r\nlost, owing to the dangerous currents and rocks in the straits, the\r\nSpanish government burnt the church, and thus arbitrarily compelled the\r\ngreater number of inhabitants to migrate to S. Carlos. We had not long\r\nbivouacked, before the barefooted son of the governor came down to\r\nreconnoitre us. Seeing the English flag hoisted at the yawl’s masthead,\r\nhe asked with the utmost indifference, whether it was always to fly at\r\nChacao. In several places the inhabitants were much astonished at the\r\nappearance of men-of-war’s boats, and hoped and believed it was the\r\nforerunner of a Spanish fleet, coming to recover the island from the\r\npatriot government of Chile. All the men in power, however, had been\r\ninformed of our intended visit, and were exceedingly civil. While we\r\nwere eating our supper, the governor paid us a visit. He had been a\r\nlieutenant-colonel in the Spanish service, but now was miserably poor.\r\nHe gave us two sheep, and accepted in return two cotton handkerchiefs,\r\nsome brass trinkets, and a little tobacco.\r\n\r\n\r\n25_th._—Torrents of rain: we managed, however, to run down the coast as\r\nfar as Huapi-lenou. The whole of this eastern side of Chiloe has one\r\naspect; it is a plain, broken by valleys and divided into little\r\nislands, and the whole thickly covered with one impervious\r\nblackish-green forest. On the margins there are some cleared spaces,\r\nsurrounding the high-roofed cottages.\r\n\r\n26_th._—The day rose splendidly clear. The volcano of Orsono was\r\nspouting out volumes of smoke. This most beautiful mountain, formed\r\nlike a perfect cone, and white with snow, stands out in front of the\r\nCordillera. Another great volcano, with a saddle-shaped summit, also\r\nemitted from its immense crater little jets of steam. Subsequently we\r\nsaw the lofty-peaked Corcovado—well deserving the name of “el famoso\r\nCorcovado.” Thus we beheld, from one point of view, three great active\r\nvolcanoes, each about seven thousand feet high. In addition to this,\r\nfar to the south there were other lofty cones covered with snow, which,\r\nalthough not known to be active, must be in their origin volcanic. The\r\nline of the Andes is not, in this neighbourhood, nearly so elevated as\r\nin Chile; neither does it appear to form so perfect a barrier between\r\nthe regions of the earth. This great range, although running in a\r\nstraight north and south line, owing to an optical deception always\r\nappeared more or less curved; for the lines drawn from each peak to the\r\nbeholder’s eye necessarily converged like the radii of a semicircle,\r\nand as it was not possible (owing to the clearness of the atmosphere\r\nand the absence of all intermediate objects) to judge how far distant\r\nthe farthest peaks were off, they appeared to stand in a flattish\r\nsemicircle.\r\n\r\nLanding at midday, we saw a family of pure Indian extraction. The\r\nfather was singularly like York Minster; and some of the younger boys,\r\nwith their ruddy complexions, might have been mistaken for Pampas\r\nIndians. Everything I have seen convinces me of the close connexion of\r\nthe different American tribes, who nevertheless speak distinct\r\nlanguages. This party could muster but little Spanish, and talked to\r\neach other in their own tongue. It is a pleasant thing to see the\r\naborigines advanced to the same degree of civilisation, however low\r\nthat may be, which their white conquerors have attained.\r\nMore to the south we saw many pure Indians: indeed, all the inhabitants\r\nof some of the islets retain their Indian surnames. In the census of\r\n1832 there were in Chiloe and its dependencies forty-two thousand\r\nsouls: the greater number of these appear to be of mixed blood. Eleven\r\nthousand retain their Indian surnames, but it is probable that not\r\nnearly all of these are of a pure breed. Their manner of life is the\r\nsame with that of the other poor inhabitants, and they are all\r\nChristians; but it is said that they yet retain some strange\r\nsuperstitious ceremonies, and that they pretend to hold communication\r\nwith the devil in certain caves. Formerly, every one convicted of this\r\noffence was sent to the Inquisition at Lima. Many of the inhabitants\r\nwho are not included in the eleven thousand with Indian surnames,\r\ncannot be distinguished by their appearance from Indians. Gomez, the\r\ngovernor of Lemuy, is descended from noblemen of Spain on both sides;\r\nbut by constant intermarriages with the natives the present man is an\r\nIndian. On the other hand, the governor of Quinchao boasts much of his\r\npurely kept Spanish blood.\r\n\r\nWe reached at night a beautiful little cove, north of the island of\r\nCaucahue. The people here complained of want of land. This is partly\r\nowing to their own negligence in not clearing the woods, and partly to\r\nrestrictions by the government, which makes it necessary, before buying\r\never so small a piece, to pay two shillings to the surveyor for\r\nmeasuring each quadra (150 yards square), together with whatever price\r\nhe fixes for the value of the land. After his valuation the land must\r\nbe put up three times to auction, and if no one bids more, the\r\npurchaser can have it at that rate. All these exactions must be a\r\nserious check to clearing the ground, where the inhabitants are so\r\nextremely poor. In most countries, forests are removed without much\r\ndifficulty by the aid of fire; but in Chiloe, from the damp nature of\r\nthe climate, and the sort of trees, it is necessary first to cut them\r\ndown. This is a heavy drawback to the prosperity of Chiloe. In the time\r\nof the Spaniards the Indians could not hold land; and a family, after\r\nhaving cleared a piece of ground, might be driven away, and the\r\nproperty seized by the government. The Chilian authorities are now\r\nperforming an act of justice by making retribution to these poor\r\nIndians, giving to each\r\nman, according to his grade of life, a certain portion of land. The\r\nvalue of uncleared ground is very little. The government gave Mr.\r\nDouglas (the present surveyor, who informed me of these circumstances)\r\neight and a half square miles of forest near S. Carlos, in lieu of a\r\ndebt; and this he sold for 350 dollars, or about £70 sterling.\r\n\r\nThe two succeeding days were fine, and at night we reached the island\r\nof Quinchao. This neighbourhood is the most cultivated part of the\r\nArchipelago; for a broad strip of land on the coast of the main island,\r\nas well as on many of the smaller adjoining ones, is almost completely\r\ncleared. Some of the farmhouses seemed very comfortable. I was curious\r\nto ascertain how rich any of these people might be, but Mr. Douglas\r\nsays that no one can be considered as possessing a regular income. One\r\nof the richest landowners might possibly accumulate, in a long\r\nindustrious life, as much as £1000 sterling; but should this happen, it\r\nwould all be stowed away in some secret corner, for it is the custom of\r\nalmost every family to have a jar or treasure-chest buried in the\r\nground.\r\n\r\n_November_ 30_th._—Early on Sunday morning we reached Castro, the\r\nancient capital of Chiloe, but now a most forlorn and deserted place.\r\nThe usual quadrangular arrangement of Spanish towns could be traced,\r\nbut the streets and plaza were coated with fine green turf, on which\r\nsheep were browsing. The church, which stands in the middle, is\r\nentirely built of plank, and has a picturesque and venerable\r\nappearance. The poverty of the place may be conceived from the fact,\r\nthat although containing some hundreds of inhabitants, one of our party\r\nwas unable anywhere to purchase either a pound of sugar or an ordinary\r\nknife. No individual possessed either a watch or a clock; and an old\r\nman who was supposed to have a good idea of time, was employed to\r\nstrike the church bell by guess. The arrival of our boats was a rare\r\nevent in this quiet retired corner of the world; and nearly all the\r\ninhabitants came down to the beach to see us pitch our tents. They were\r\nvery civil, and offered us a house; and one man even sent us a cask of\r\ncider as a present. In the afternoon we paid our respects to the\r\ngovernor—a quiet old man, who, in his appearance and manner of life,\r\nwas scarcely superior to an English cottager. At night heavy rain set\r\nin, which was\r\nhardly sufficient to drive away from our tents the large circle of\r\nlookers on. An Indian family, who had come to trade in a canoe from\r\nCaylen, bivouacked near us. They had no shelter during the rain. In the\r\nmorning I asked a young Indian, who was wet to the skin, how he had\r\npassed the night. He seemed perfectly content, and answered, “Muy bien,\r\nseñor.”\r\n\r\n_December_ 1_st._—We steered for the island of Lemuy. I was anxious to\r\nexamine a reported coal-mine which turned out to be lignite of little\r\nvalue, in the sandstone (probably of an ancient tertiary epoch) of\r\nwhich these islands are composed. When we reached Lemuy we had much\r\ndifficulty in finding any place to pitch our tents, for it was\r\nspring-tide, and the land was wooded down to the water’s edge. In a\r\nshort time we were surrounded by a large group of the nearly pure\r\nIndian inhabitants. They were much surprised at our arrival, and said\r\none to the other, “This is the reason we have seen so many parrots\r\nlately; the cheucau (an odd red-breasted little bird, which inhabits\r\nthe thick forest, and utters very peculiar noises) has not cried\r\n‘beware’ for nothing.” They were soon anxious for barter. Money was\r\nscarcely worth anything, but their eagerness for tobacco was something\r\nquite extraordinary. After tobacco, indigo came next in value; then\r\ncapsicum, old clothes, and gunpowder. The latter article was required\r\nfor a very innocent purpose: each parish has a public musket, and the\r\ngunpowder was wanted for making a noise on their saint or feast days.\r\n\r\nThe people here live chiefly on shell-fish and potatoes. At certain\r\nseasons they catch also, in “corrales,” or hedges under water, many\r\nfish which are left on the mud-banks as the tide falls. They\r\noccasionally possess fowls, sheep, goats, pigs, horses, and cattle; the\r\norder in which they are here mentioned, expressing their respective\r\nnumbers. I never saw anything more obliging and humble than the manners\r\nof these people. They generally began with stating that they were poor\r\nnatives of the place, and not Spaniards and that they were in sad want\r\nof tobacco and other comforts. At Caylen, the most southern island, the\r\nsailors bought with a stick of tobacco, of the value of\r\nthree-halfpence, two fowls, one of which, the Indian stated, had skin\r\nbetween its toes, and turned out to\r\nbe a fine duck; and with some cotton handkerchiefs, worth three\r\nshillings, three sheep and a large bunch of onions were procured. The\r\nyawl at this place was anchored some way from the shore, and we had\r\nfears for her safety from robbers during the night. Our pilot, Mr.\r\nDouglas, accordingly told the constable of the district that we always\r\nplaced sentinels with loaded arms, and not understanding Spanish, if we\r\nsaw any person in the dark, we should assuredly shoot him. The\r\nconstable, with much humility, agreed to the perfect propriety of this\r\narrangement, and promised us that no one should stir out of his house\r\nduring that night.\r\n\r\nDuring the four succeeding days we continued sailing southward. The\r\ngeneral features of the country remained the same, but it was much less\r\nthickly inhabited. On the large island of Tanqui there was scarcely one\r\ncleared spot, the trees on every side extending their branches over the\r\nsea-beach. I one day noticed, growing on the sandstone cliffs, some\r\nvery fine plants of the panke (Gunnera scabra), which somewhat\r\nresembles the rhubarb on a gigantic scale. The inhabitants eat the\r\nstalks, which are subacid, and tan leather with the roots, and prepare\r\na black dye from them. The leaf is nearly circular, but deeply indented\r\non its margin. I measured one which was nearly eight feet in diameter,\r\nand therefore no less than twenty-four in circumference! The stalk is\r\nrather more than a yard high, and each plant sends out four or five of\r\nthese enormous leaves, presenting together a very noble appearance.\r\n\r\n_December_ 6_th._—We reached Caylen, called “el fin del Cristiandad.”\r\nIn the morning we stopped for a few minutes at a house on the northern\r\nend of Laylec, which was the extreme point of South American\r\nChristendom, and a miserable hovel it was. The latitude is 43° 10′,\r\nwhich is two degrees farther south than the Rio Negro on the Atlantic\r\ncoast. These extreme Christians were very poor, and, under the plea of\r\ntheir situation, begged for some tobacco. As a proof of the poverty of\r\nthese Indians, I may mention that shortly before this we had met a man,\r\nwho had travelled three days and a half on foot, and had as many to\r\nreturn, for the sake of recovering the value of a small axe and a few\r\nfish. How very difficult it must be to buy the smallest article, when\r\nsuch trouble is taken to recover so small a debt.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the evening we reached the island of San Pedro, where we found the\r\n_Beagle_ at anchor. In doubling the point, two of the officers landed\r\nto take a round of angles with the theodolite. A fox (Canis fulvipes),\r\nof a kind said to be peculiar to the island, and very rare in it, and\r\nwhich is a new species, was sitting on the rocks. He was so intently\r\nabsorbed in watching the work of the officers, that I was able, by\r\nquietly walking up behind, to knock him on the head with my geological\r\nhammer. This fox, more curious or more scientific, but less wise, than\r\nthe generality of his brethren, is now mounted in the museum of the\r\nZoological Society.\r\n\r\nWe stayed three days in this harbour, on one of which Captain Fitz Roy,\r\nwith a party, attempted to ascend to the summit of San Pedro. The woods\r\nhere had rather a different appearance from those on the northern part\r\nof the island. The rock, also, being micaceous slate, there was no\r\nbeach, but the steep sides dipped directly beneath the water. The\r\ngeneral aspect in consequence was more like that of Tierra del Fuego\r\nthan of Chiloe. In vain we tried to gain the summit: the forest was so\r\nimpenetrable, that no one who has not beheld it can imagine so\r\nentangled a mass of dying and dead trunks. I am sure that often, for\r\nmore than ten minutes together, our feet never touched the ground, and\r\nwe were frequently ten or fifteen feet above it, so that the seamen as\r\na joke called out the soundings. At other times we crept one after\r\nanother, on our hands and knees, under the rotten trunks. In the lower\r\npart of the mountain, noble trees of the Winter’s Bark, and a laurel\r\nlike the sassafras with fragrant leaves, and others, the names of which\r\nI do not know, were matted together by a trailing bamboo or cane. Here\r\nwe were more like fishes struggling in a net than any other animal. On\r\nthe higher parts, brushwood takes the place of larger trees, with here\r\nand there a red cedar or an alerce pine. I was also pleased to see, at\r\nan elevation of a little less than 1000 feet, our old friend the\r\nsouthern beech. They were, however, poor stunted trees, and I should\r\nthink that this must be nearly their northern limit. We ultimately gave\r\nup the attempt in despair.\r\n\r\n_December_ 10_th._—The yawl and whale-boat, with Mr. Sulivan, proceeded\r\non their survey, but I remained on board the _ Beagle_, which the next\r\nday left San Pedro for the southward. On the\r\n13th we ran into an opening in the southern part of Guayatecas, or the\r\nChonos Archipelago; and it was fortunate we did so, for on the\r\nfollowing day a storm, worthy of Tierra del Fuego, raged with great\r\nfury. White massive clouds were piled up against a dark blue sky, and\r\nacross them black ragged sheets of vapour were rapidly driven. The\r\nsuccessive mountain ranges appeared like dim shadows, and the setting\r\nsun cast on the woodland a yellow gleam, much like that produced by the\r\nflame of spirits of wine. The water was white with the flying spray,\r\nand the wind lulled and roared again through the rigging: it was an\r\nominous, sublime scene. During a few minutes there was a bright\r\nrainbow, and it was curious to observe the effect of the spray, which,\r\nbeing carried along the surface of the water, changed the ordinary\r\nsemicircle into a circle—a band of prismatic colours being continued,\r\nfrom both feet of the common arch across the bay, close to the vessel’s\r\nside: thus forming a distorted, but very nearly entire ring.\r\n\r\nInside Chonos Archipelago\r\n\r\nWe stayed here three days. The weather continued bad; but this did not\r\nmuch signify, for the surface of the land in all these islands is all\r\nbut impassable. The coast is so very rugged that to attempt to walk in\r\nthat direction requires\r\ncontinued scrambling up and down over the sharp rocks of mica-slate;\r\nand as for the woods, our faces, hands, and shin-bones all bore witness\r\nto the maltreatment we received, in merely attempting to penetrate\r\ntheir forbidden recesses.\r\n\r\n_December_ 18_th._—We stood out to sea. On the 20th we bade farewell to\r\nthe south, and with a fair wind turned the ship’s head northward. From\r\nCape Tres Montes we sailed pleasantly along the lofty weather-beaten\r\ncoast, which is remarkable for the bold outline of its hills, and the\r\nthick covering of forest even on the almost precipitous flanks. The\r\nnext day a harbour was discovered, which on this dangerous coast might\r\nbe of great service to a distressed vessel. It can easily be recognised\r\nby a hill 1600 feet high, which is even more perfectly conical than the\r\nfamous sugar-loaf at Rio de Janeiro. The next day, after anchoring, I\r\nsucceeded in reaching the summit of this hill. It was a laborious\r\nundertaking, for the sides were so steep that in some parts it was\r\nnecessary to use the trees as ladders. There were also several\r\nextensive brakes of the Fuchsia, covered with its beautiful drooping\r\nflowers, but very difficult to crawl through. In these wild countries\r\nit gives much delight to gain the summit of any mountain. There is an\r\nindefinite expectation of seeing something very strange, which, however\r\noften it may be balked, never failed with me to recur on each\r\nsuccessive attempt. Every one must know the feeling of triumph and\r\npride which a grand view from a height communicates to the mind. In\r\nthese little frequented countries there is also joined to it some\r\nvanity, that you perhaps are the first man who ever stood on this\r\npinnacle or admired this view.\r\n\r\nA strong desire is always felt to ascertain whether any human being has\r\npreviously visited an unfrequented spot. A bit of wood with a nail in\r\nit is picked up and studied as if it were covered with hieroglyphics.\r\nPossessed with this feeling, I was much interested by finding, on a\r\nwild part of the coast, a bed made of grass beneath a ledge of rock.\r\nClose by it there had been a fire, and the man had used an axe. The\r\nfire, bed, and situation showed the dexterity of an Indian; but he\r\ncould scarcely have been an Indian, for the race is in this part\r\nextinct, owing to the Catholic desire of making at one blow Christians\r\nand Slaves. I had at the time some misgivings\r\nthat the solitary man who had made his bed on this wild spot, must have\r\nbeen some poor shipwrecked sailor, who, in trying to travel up the\r\ncoast, had here laid himself down for his dreary night.\r\n\r\n_December_ 28_th._—The weather continued very bad, but it at last\r\npermitted us to proceed with the survey. The time hung heavy on our\r\nhands, as it always did when we were delayed from day to day by\r\nsuccessive gales of wind. In the evening another harbour was\r\ndiscovered, where we anchored. Directly afterwards a man was seen\r\nwaving his shirt, and a boat was sent which brought back two seamen. A\r\nparty of six had run away from an American whaling vessel, and had\r\nlanded a little to the southward in a boat, which was shortly\r\nafterwards knocked to pieces by the surf. They had now been wandering\r\nup and down the coast for fifteen months, without knowing which way to\r\ngo, or where they were. What a singular piece of good fortune it was\r\nthat this harbour was now discovered! Had it not been for this one\r\nchance, they might have wandered till they had grown old men, and at\r\nlast have perished on this wild coast. Their sufferings had been very\r\ngreat, and one of their party had lost his life by falling from the\r\ncliffs. They were sometimes obliged to separate in search of food, and\r\nthis explained the bed of the solitary man. Considering what they had\r\nundergone, I think they had kept a very good reckoning of time, for\r\nthey had lost only four days.\r\n\r\n_December_ 30_th._—We anchored in a snug little cove at the foot of\r\nsome high hills, near the northern extremity of Tres Montes. After\r\nbreakfast the next morning a party ascended one of these mountains,\r\nwhich was 2400 feet high. The scenery was remarkable. The chief part of\r\nthe range was composed of grand, solid, abrupt masses of granite, which\r\nappeared as if they had been coeval with the beginning of the world.\r\nThe granite was capped with mica-slate, and this in the lapse of ages\r\nhad been worn into strange finger-shaped points. These two formations,\r\nthus differing in their outlines, agree in being almost destitute of\r\nvegetation. This barrenness had to our eyes a strange appearance, from\r\nhaving been so long accustomed to the sight of an almost universal\r\nforest of dark-green trees. I took much delight in examining the\r\nstructure of these mountains. The complicated and lofty ranges bore a\r\nnoble aspect of durability—equally profitless, however, to man and to\r\nall other animals. Granite to the geologist is classic ground: from its\r\nwidespread limits, and its beautiful and compact texture, few rocks\r\nhave been more anciently recognised. Granite has given rise, perhaps,\r\nto more discussion concerning its origin than any other formation. We\r\ngenerally see it constituting the fundamental rock, and, however\r\nformed, we know it is the deepest layer in the crust of this globe to\r\nwhich man has penetrated. The limit of man’s knowledge in any subject\r\npossesses a high interest, which is perhaps increased by its close\r\nneighbourhood to the realms of imagination.\r\n\r\n_January_ 1_st_, 1835.—The new year is ushered in with the ceremonies\r\nproper to it in these regions. She lays out no false hopes: a heavy\r\nnorth-western gale, with steady rain, bespeaks the rising year. Thank\r\nGod, we are not destined here to see the end of it, but hope then to be\r\nin the Pacific Ocean, where a blue sky tells one there is a heaven,—a\r\nsomething beyond the clouds above our heads.\r\n\r\nThe north-west winds prevailing for the next four days, we only managed\r\nto cross a great bay, and then anchored in another secure harbour. I\r\naccompanied the Captain in a boat to the head of a deep creek. On the\r\nway the number of seals which we saw was quite astonishing: every bit\r\nof flat rock and parts of the beach were covered with them. They\r\nappeared to be of a loving disposition, and lay huddled together, fast\r\nasleep, like so many pigs; but even pigs would have been ashamed of\r\ntheir dirt, and of the foul smell which came from them. Each herd was\r\nwatched by the patient but inauspicious eyes of the turkey-buzzard.\r\nThis disgusting bird, with its bald scarlet head, formed to wallow in\r\nputridity, is very common on the west coast, and their attendance on\r\nthe seals shows on what they rely for their food. We found the water\r\n(probably only that of the surface) nearly fresh: this was caused by\r\nthe number of torrents which, in the form of cascades, came tumbling\r\nover the bold granite mountains into the sea. The fresh water attracts\r\nthe fish, and these bring many terns, gulls, and two kinds of\r\ncormorant. We saw also a pair of the beautiful black-necked swans, and\r\nseveral small sea-otters, the fur of which is held in such high\r\nestimation. In returning, we\r\nwere again amused by the impetuous manner in which the heap of seals,\r\nold and young, tumbled into the water as the boat passed. They did not\r\nremain long under water, but rising, followed us with outstretched\r\nnecks, expressing great wonder and curiosity.\r\n\r\n7_th._—Having run up the coast, we anchored near the northern end of\r\nthe Chonos Archipelago, in Low’s Harbour, where we remained a week. The\r\nislands were here, as in Chiloe, composed of a stratified, soft,\r\nlittoral deposit; and the vegetation in consequence was beautifully\r\nluxuriant. The woods came down to the sea-beach, just in the manner of\r\nan evergreen shrubbery over a gravel walk. We also enjoyed from the\r\nanchorage a splendid view of four great snowy cones of the Cordillera,\r\nincluding “el famoso Corcovado;” the range itself had in this latitude\r\nso little height, that few parts of it appeared above the tops of the\r\nneighbouring islets. We found here a party of five men from Caylen, “el\r\nfin del Cristiandad,” who had most adventurously crossed in their\r\nmiserable boat-canoe, for the purpose of fishing, the open space of sea\r\nwhich separates Chonos from Chiloe. These islands will, in all\r\nprobability, in a short time become peopled like those adjoining the\r\ncoast of Chiloe.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe wild potato grows on these islands in great abundance, on the\r\nsandy, shelly soil near the sea-beach. The tallest plant was four feet\r\nin height. The tubers were generally small, but I found one, of an oval\r\nshape, two inches in diameter: they resembled in every respect, and had\r\nthe same smell as English potatoes; but when boiled they shrunk much,\r\nand were watery and insipid, without any bitter taste. They are\r\nundoubtedly here indigenous: they grow as far south, according to Mr.\r\nLow, as lat. 50°, and are called Aquinas by the wild Indians of that\r\npart: the Chilotan Indians have a different name for them. Professor\r\nHenslow, who has examined the dried specimens which I brought home,\r\nsays that they are the same with those described by Mr. Sabine[1] from\r\nValparaiso, but that they form a\r\nvariety which by some botanists has been considered as specifically\r\ndistinct. It is remarkable that the same plant should be found on the\r\nsterile mountains of central Chile, where a drop of rain does not fall\r\nfor more than six months, and within the damp forests of these southern\r\nislands.\r\n\r\n [1] _Horticultural Transact._ vol. v, p. 249. Mr. Caldeleugh sent home\r\n two tubers, which, being well manured, even the first season produced\r\n numerous potatoes and an abundance of leaves. See Humboldt’s\r\n interesting discussion on this plant, which it appears was unknown in\r\n Mexico,—in _Polit. Essay on New Spain_, book iv, chap. ix.\r\n\r\nIn the central parts of the Chonos Archipelago (lat. 45°), the forest\r\nhas very much the same character with that along the whole west coast,\r\nfor 600 miles southward to Cape Horn. The arborescent grass of Chiloe\r\nis not found here; while the beech of Tierra del Fuego grows to a good\r\nsize, and forms a considerable proportion of the wood; not, however, in\r\nthe same exclusive manner as it does farther southward. Cryptogamic\r\nplants here find a most congenial climate. In the Strait of Magellan,\r\nas I have before remarked, the country appears too cold and wet to\r\nallow of their arriving at perfection; but in these islands, within the\r\nforest, the number of species and great abundance of mosses, lichens,\r\nand small ferns, is quite extraordinary.[2] In Tierra del Fuego trees\r\ngrow only on the hillsides; every level piece of land being invariably\r\ncovered by a thick bed of peat; but in Chiloe flat land supports the\r\nmost luxuriant forests. Here, within the Chonos Archipelago, the nature\r\nof the climate more closely approaches that of Tierra del Fuego than\r\nthat of northern Chiloe; for every patch of level ground is covered by\r\ntwo species of plants (Astelia pumila and Donatia magellanica), which\r\nby their joint decay compose a thick bed of elastic peat.\r\n\r\n [2] By sweeping with my insect-net, I procured from these situations a\r\n considerable number of minute insects, of the family of Staphylinidæ,\r\n and others allied to Pselaphus, and minute Hymenoptera. But the most\r\n characteristic family in number, both of individuals and species,\r\n throughout the more open parts of Chiloe and Chonos is that of\r\n Telephoridæ.\r\n\r\nIn Tierra del Fuego, above the region of woodland, the former of these\r\neminently sociable plants is the chief agent in the production of peat.\r\nFresh leaves are always succeeding one to the other round the central\r\ntap-root, the lower ones soon decay, and in tracing a root downwards in\r\nthe peat, the leaves, yet holding their place, can be observed passing\r\nthrough every stage of decomposition, till the whole becomes blended in\r\none confused mass. The Astelia is assisted by a few other plants,—here\r\nand there a small creeping Myrtus (M. nummularia), with a woody stem\r\nlike our cranberry and with a sweet berry,—an\r\nEmpetrum (E. rubrum), like our heath,—a rush (Juncus grandiflorus), are\r\nnearly the only ones that grow on the swampy surface. These plants,\r\nthough possessing a very close general resemblance to the English\r\nspecies of the same genera, are different. In the more level parts of\r\nthe country, the surface of the peat is broken up into little pools of\r\nwater, which stand at different heights, and appear as if artificially\r\nexcavated. Small streams of water, flowing underground, complete the\r\ndisorganisation of the vegetable matter, and consolidate the whole.\r\n\r\nThe climate of the southern part of America appears particularly\r\nfavourable to the production of peat. In the Falkland Islands almost\r\nevery kind of plant, even the coarse grass which covers the whole\r\nsurface of the land, becomes converted into this substance: scarcely\r\nany situation checks its growth; some of the beds are as much as twelve\r\nfeet thick, and the lower part becomes so solid when dry, that it will\r\nhardly burn. Although every plant lends its aid, yet in most parts the\r\nAstelia is the most efficient. It is rather a singular circumstance, as\r\nbeing so very different from what occurs in Europe, that I nowhere saw\r\nmoss forming by its decay any portion of the peat in South America.\r\nWith respect to the northern limit at which the climate allows of that\r\npeculiar kind of slow decomposition which is necessary for its\r\nproduction, I believe that in Chiloe (lat. 41° to 42°), although there\r\nis much swampy ground, no well-characterised peat occurs: but in the\r\nChonos Islands, three degrees farther southward, we have seen that it\r\nis abundant. On the eastern coast in La Plata (lat. 35°) I was told by\r\na Spanish resident who had visited Ireland, that he had often sought\r\nfor this substance, but had never been able to find any. He showed me,\r\nas the nearest approach to it which he had discovered, a black peaty\r\nsoil, so penetrated with roots as to allow of an extremely slow and\r\nimperfect combustion.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe zoology of these broken islets of the Chonos Archipelago is, as\r\nmight have been expected, very poor. Of quadrupeds two aquatic kinds\r\nare common. The Myopotamus Coypus (like a beaver, but with a round\r\ntail) is well known from its fine fur, which is an object of trade\r\nthroughout the tributaries of La\r\nPlata. It here, however, exclusively frequents salt water; which same\r\ncircumstance has been mentioned as sometimes occurring with the great\r\nrodent, the Capybara. A small sea-otter is very numerous; this animal\r\ndoes not feed exclusively on fish, but, like the seals, draws a large\r\nsupply from a small red crab, which swims in shoals near the surface of\r\nthe water. Mr. Bynoe saw one in Tierra del Fuego eating a cuttle-fish;\r\nand at Low’s Harbour, another was killed in the act of carrying to its\r\nhole a large volute shell. At one place I caught in a trap a singular\r\nlittle mouse (M. brachiotis); it appeared common on several of the\r\nislets, but the Chilotans at Low’s Harbour said that it was not found\r\nin all. What a succession of chances,[3] or what changes of level must\r\nhave been brought into play, thus to spread these small animals\r\nthroughout this broken archipelago!\r\n\r\n [3] It is said that some rapacious birds bring their prey alive to\r\n their nests. If so, in the course of centuries, every now and then,\r\n one might escape from the young birds. Some such agency is necessary,\r\n to account for the distribution of the smaller gnawing animals on\r\n islands not very near each other.\r\n\r\nIn all parts of Chiloe and Chonos, two very strange birds occur, which\r\nare allied to, and replace, the Turco and Tapacolo of central Chile.\r\nOne is called by the inhabitants “Cheucau” (Pteroptochos rubecula): it\r\nfrequents the most gloomy and retired spots within the damp forests.\r\nSometimes, although its cry may be heard close at hand, let a person\r\nwatch ever so attentively he will not see the cheucau; at other times\r\nlet him stand motionless and the red-breasted little bird will approach\r\nwithin a few feet in the most familiar manner. It then busily hops\r\nabout the entangled mass of rotting canes and branches, with its little\r\ntail cocked upwards. The cheucau is held in superstitious fear by the\r\nChilotans, on account of its strange and varied cries. There are three\r\nvery distinct cries: One is called “chiduco,” and is an omen of good;\r\nanother, “huitreu,” which is extremely unfavourable; and a third, which\r\nI have forgotten. These words are given in imitation of the noises; and\r\nthe natives are in some things absolutely governed by them. The\r\nChilotans assuredly have chosen a most comical little creature for\r\ntheir prophet. An allied species, but rather larger, is called by the\r\nnatives “Guid-guid” (Pteroptochos Tarnii), and by the English the\r\nbarking-bird. This latter name is well given; for\r\nI defy any one at first to feel certain that a small dog is not yelping\r\nsomewhere in the forest. Just as with the cheucau, a person will\r\nsometimes hear the bark close by, but in vain may endeavour by\r\nwatching, and with still less chance by beating the bushes, to see the\r\nbird; yet at other times the guid-guid fearlessly comes near. Its\r\nmanner of feeding and its general habits are very similar to those of\r\nthe cheucau.\r\n\r\nOn the coast,[4] a small dusky-coloured bird (Opetiorhynchus\r\nPatagonicus) is very common. It is remarkable from its quiet habits; it\r\nlives entirely on the sea-beach, like a sandpiper. Besides these birds\r\nonly few others inhabit this broken land. In my rough notes I describe\r\nthe strange noises, which, although frequently heard within these\r\ngloomy forests, yet scarcely disturb the general silence. The yelping\r\nof the guid-guid, and the sudden whew-whew of the cheucau, sometimes\r\ncome from afar off, and sometimes from close at hand; the little black\r\nwren of Tierra del Fuego occasionally adds its cry; the creeper\r\n(Oxyurus) follows the intruder screaming and twittering; the\r\nhumming-bird may be seen every now and then darting from side to side,\r\nand emitting, like an insect, its shrill chirp; lastly, from the top of\r\nsome lofty tree the indistinct but plaintive note of the white-tufted\r\ntyrant-flycatcher (Myiobius) may be noticed. From the great\r\npreponderance in most countries of certain common genera of birds, such\r\nas the finches, one feels at first surprised at meeting with the\r\npeculiar forms above enumerated, as the commonest birds in any\r\ndistrict. In central Chile two of them, namely, the Oxyurus and\r\nScytalopus, occur, although most rarely. When finding, as in this case,\r\nanimals which seem to play so insignificant a part in the great scheme\r\nof nature, one is apt to wonder why they were created. But it should\r\nalways be recollected, that in some other country perhaps they are\r\nessential members of society, or at some former period may have been\r\nso. If America south of 37° were sunk beneath the waters of the ocean,\r\nthese two birds might continue to exist in central Chile for a long\r\nperiod, but it is very improbable that their numbers would increase. We\r\nshould then see a case which must inevitably have happened with very\r\nmany animals.\r\n\r\n [4] I may mention, as a proof of how great a difference there is\r\n between the seasons of the wooded and the open parts of this coast,\r\n that on September 20th, in lat. 34°, these birds had young ones in the\r\n nest, while among the Chonos Islands, three months later in the\r\n summer, they were only laying, the difference in latitude between\r\n these two places being about 700 miles.\r\n\r\nThese southern seas are frequented by several species of Petrels: the\r\nlargest kind, Procellaria gigantea, or nelly (quebrantahuesos, or\r\nbreak-bones, of the Spaniards), is a common bird, both in the inland\r\nchannels and on the open sea. In its habits and manner of flight there\r\nis a very close resemblance with the albatross; and as with the\r\nalbatross, a person may watch it for hours together without seeing on\r\nwhat it feeds. The “break-bones” is, however, a rapacious bird, for it\r\nwas observed by some of the officers at Port St. Antonio chasing a\r\ndiver, which tried to escape by diving and flying, but was continually\r\nstruck down, and at last killed by a blow on its head. At Port St.\r\nJulian these great petrels were seen killing and devouring young gulls.\r\nA second species (Puffinus cinereus), which is common to Europe, Cape\r\nHorn, and the coast of Peru, is of a much smaller size than the P.\r\ngigantea, but, like it, of a dirty black colour. It generally frequents\r\nthe inland sounds in very large flocks: I do not think I ever saw so\r\nmany birds of any other sort together, as I once saw of these behind\r\nthe island of Chiloe. Hundreds of thousands flew in an irregular line\r\nfor several hours in one direction. When part of the flock settled on\r\nthe water the surface was blackened, and a noise proceeded from them as\r\nof human beings talking in the distance.\r\n\r\nThere are several other species of petrels, but I will only mention one\r\nother kind, the Pelacanoides Berardi, which offers an example of those\r\nextraordinary cases, of a bird evidently belonging to one well-marked\r\nfamily, yet both in its habits and structure allied to a very distinct\r\ntribe. This bird never leaves the quiet inland sounds. When disturbed\r\nit dives to a distance, and on coming to the surface, with the same\r\nmovement takes flight. After flying by the rapid movement of its short\r\nwings for a space in a straight line, it drops, as if struck dead, and\r\ndives again. The form of its beak and nostrils, length of foot, and\r\neven the colouring of its plumage, show that this bird is a petrel: on\r\nthe other hand, its short wings and consequent little power of flight,\r\nits form of body and shape of tail, the absence of a hind toe to its\r\nfoot, its habit of living, and its choice of situation, make it at\r\nfirst doubtful\r\nwhether its relationship is not equally close with the auks. It would\r\nundoubtedly be mistaken for an auk, when seen from a distance, either\r\non the wing, or when diving and quietly swimming about the retired\r\nchannels of Tierra del Fuego.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Gunnera Scabra, Chiloe]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Antuco Volcano, near Talcahuano]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIV\r\n\r\n\r\nSan Carlos, Chiloe—Osorno in eruption, contemporaneously with Aconcagua\r\nand Coseguina—Ride to Cucao—Impenetrable\r\nforests—Valdivia—Indians—Earthquake—Concepcion—Great earthquake—Rocks\r\nfissured—Appearance of the former towns—The sea black and\r\nboiling—Direction of the vibrations—Stones twisted round—Great\r\nwave—Permanent elevation of the land—Area of volcanic phenomena—The\r\nconnection between the elevatory and eruptive forces—Cause of\r\nearthquakes—Slow elevation of mountain-chains.\r\n\r\nCHILOE AND CONCEPCION: GREAT EARTHQUAKE\r\n\r\nOn January the 15th, 1835 we sailed from Low’s Harbour, and three days\r\nafterwards anchored a second time in the bay of S. Carlos in Chiloe. On\r\nthe night of the 19th the volcano of Osorno was in action. At midnight\r\nthe sentry observed something like a large star, which gradually\r\nincreased in size till about three o’clock, when it presented a very\r\nmagnificent\r\nspectacle. By the aid of a glass, dark objects, in constant succession,\r\nwere seen, in the midst of a great glare of red light, to be thrown up\r\nand to fall down. The light was sufficient to cast on the water a long\r\nbright reflection. Large masses of molten matter seem very commonly to\r\nbe cast out of the craters in this part of the Cordillera. I was\r\nassured that when the Corcovado is in eruption, great masses are\r\nprojected upwards and are seen to burst in the air, assuming many\r\nfantastical forms, such as trees: their size must be immense, for they\r\ncan be distinguished from the high land behind S. Carlos, which is no\r\nless than ninety-three miles from the Corcovado. In the morning the\r\nvolcano became tranquil.\r\n\r\nPanoramic view of coast\r\n\r\nI was surprised at hearing afterwards that Aconcagua in Chile, 480\r\nmiles northwards, was in action on the same night; and still more\r\nsurprised to hear that the great eruption of Coseguina (2700 miles\r\nnorth of Aconcagua), accompanied by an earthquake felt over 1000 miles,\r\nalso occurred within six hours of this same time. This coincidence is\r\nthe more remarkable, as Coseguina had been dormant for twenty-six\r\nyears: and Aconcagua most rarely shows any signs of action. It is\r\ndifficult even to conjecture whether this coincidence was accidental,\r\nor shows some subterranean connection. If Vesuvius, Etna, and Hecla in\r\nIceland (all three relatively nearer each other than the corresponding\r\npoints in South America),\r\nsuddenly burst forth in eruption on the same night, the coincidence\r\nwould be thought remarkable; but it is far more remarkable in this\r\ncase, where the three vents fall on the same great mountain-chain, and\r\nwhere the vast plains along the entire eastern coast, and the upraised\r\nrecent shells along more than 2000 miles on the western coast, show in\r\nhow equable and connected a manner the elevatory forces have acted.\r\n\r\nInside island of Chiloe\r\n\r\nCaptain Fitz Roy being anxious that some bearings should be taken on\r\nthe outer coast of Chiloe, it was planned that Mr. King and myself\r\nshould ride to Castro, and thence across the island to the Capella de\r\nCucao, situated on the west coast. Having hired horses and a guide, we\r\nset out on the morning of the 22nd. We had not proceeded far, before we\r\nwere joined by a woman and two boys, who were bent on the same journey.\r\nEvery one on this road acts on a “hail-fellow-well-met” fashion; and\r\none may here enjoy the privilege, so rare in South America, of\r\ntravelling without firearms. At first the country consisted of a\r\nsuccession of hills and valleys: nearer to Castro it became very level.\r\nThe road itself is a curious affair; it consists in its whole length,\r\nwith the exception of very few parts, of great logs of wood, which are\r\neither broad and laid longitudinally, or narrow and placed\r\ntransversely. In summer the road is not very bad: but in winter, when\r\nthe wood is rendered slippery from rain, travelling is exceedingly\r\ndifficult. At that time of the year, the ground on each side becomes a\r\nmorass, and is often overflowed: hence it is necessary that the\r\nlongitudinal logs should be fastened down by transverse poles, which\r\nare pegged on each side into the earth. These pegs render a fall from a\r\nhorse dangerous, as the chance of alighting on one of them is not\r\nsmall. It is remarkable, however, how active custom has made the\r\nChilotan horses. In crossing bad parts, where the logs had been\r\ndisplaced, they skipped from one to the other, almost with the\r\nquickness and certainty of a dog. On both hands the road is bordered by\r\nthe lofty forest-trees, with their bases matted together by canes. When\r\noccasionally a long reach of this avenue could be beheld, it presented\r\na curious scene of uniformity: the white line of logs, narrowing in\r\nperspective, became hidden by the gloomy forest, or terminated in a\r\nzigzag which ascended some steep hill.\r\n\r\nAlthough the distance from S. Carlos to Castro is only twelve leagues\r\nin a straight line, the formation of the road must have been a great\r\nlabour. I was told that several people had formerly lost their lives in\r\nattempting to cross the forest. The first who succeeded was an Indian,\r\nwho cut his way through the canes in eight days, and reached S. Carlos:\r\nhe was rewarded by the Spanish government with a grant of land. During\r\nthe summer, many of the Indians wander about the forests (but chiefly\r\nin the higher parts, where the woods are not quite so thick), in search\r\nof the half-wild cattle which live on the leaves of the cane and\r\ncertain trees. It was one of these huntsmen who by chance discovered, a\r\nfew years since, an English vessel, which had been wrecked on the outer\r\ncoast. The crew were beginning to fail in provisions, and it is not\r\nprobable that, without the aid of this man, they would ever have\r\nextricated themselves from these scarcely penetrable woods. As it was,\r\none seaman died on the march, from fatigue. The Indians in these\r\nexcursions steer by the sun; so that if there is a continuance of\r\ncloudy weather, they cannot travel.\r\n\r\nThe day was beautiful, and the number of trees which were in full\r\nflower perfumed the air; yet even this could hardly dissipate the\r\neffect of the gloomy dampness of the forest. Moreover, the many dead\r\ntrunks that stand like skeletons, never fail to give to these primeval\r\nwoods a character of solemnity, absent\r\nin those of countries long civilised. Shortly after sunset we\r\nbivouacked for the night. Our female companion, who was rather\r\ngood-looking, belonged to one of the most respectable families in\r\nCastro: she rode, however, astride, and without shoes or stockings. I\r\nwas surprised at the total want of pride shown by her and her brother.\r\nThey brought food with them, but at all our meals sat watching Mr. King\r\nand myself whilst eating, till we were fairly shamed into feeding the\r\nwhole party. The night was cloudless; and while lying in our beds, we\r\nenjoyed the sight (and it is a high enjoyment) of the multitude of\r\nstars which illumined the darkness of the forest.\r\n\r\n_January_ 23_rd._—We rose early in the morning, and reached the pretty\r\nquiet town of Castro by two o’clock. The old governor had died since\r\nour last visit, and a Chileno was acting in his place. We had a letter\r\nof introduction to Don Pedro, whom we found exceedingly hospitable and\r\nkind, and more disinterested than is usual on this side of the\r\ncontinent. The next day Don Pedro procured us fresh horses, and offered\r\nto accompany us himself. We proceeded to the south—generally following\r\nthe coast, and passing through several hamlets, each with its large\r\nbarn-like chapel built of wood. At Vilipilli, Don Pedro asked the\r\ncommandant to give us a guide to Cucao. The old gentleman offered to\r\ncome himself; but for a long time nothing would persuade him that two\r\nEnglishmen really wished to go to such an out-of-the-way place as\r\nCucao. We were thus accompanied by the two greatest aristocrats in the\r\ncountry, as was plainly to be seen in the manner of all the poorer\r\nIndians towards them. At Chonchi we struck across the island, following\r\nintricate winding paths, sometimes passing through magnificent forests,\r\nand sometimes through pretty cleared spots, abounding with corn and\r\npotato crops. This undulating woody country, partially cultivated,\r\nreminded me of the wilder parts of England, and therefore had to my eye\r\na most fascinating aspect. At Vilinco, which is situated on the borders\r\nof the lake of Cucao, only a few fields were cleared; and all the\r\ninhabitants appeared to be Indians. This lake is twelve miles long, and\r\nruns in an east and west direction. From local circumstances, the\r\nsea-breeze blows very regularly during the day, and during the night it\r\nfalls calm: this has given rise to strange exaggerations,\r\nfor the phenomenon, as described to us at S. Carlos, was quite a\r\nprodigy.\r\n\r\nThe road to Cucao was so very bad that we determined to embark in a\r\n_periagua._ The commandant, in the most authoritative manner, ordered\r\nsix Indians to get ready to pull us over, without deigning to tell them\r\nwhether they would be paid. The periagua is a strange rough boat, but\r\nthe crew were still stranger: I doubt if six uglier little men ever got\r\ninto a boat together. They pulled, however, very well and cheerfully.\r\nThe stroke-oarsman gabbled Indian, and uttered strange cries, much\r\nafter the fashion of a pig-driver driving his pigs. We started with a\r\nlight breeze against us, but yet reached the Capella de Cucao before it\r\nwas late. The country on each side of the lake was one unbroken forest.\r\nIn the same periagua with us a cow was embarked. To get so large an\r\nanimal into a small boat appears at first a difficulty, but the Indians\r\nmanaged it in a minute. They brought the cow alongside the boat, which\r\nwas heeled towards her; then placing two oars under her belly, with\r\ntheir ends resting on the gunwale, by the aid of these levers they\r\nfairly tumbled the poor beast heels over head into the bottom of the\r\nboat, and then lashed her down with ropes. At Cucao we found an\r\nuninhabited hovel (which is the residence of the padre when he pays\r\nthis Capella a visit), where, lighting a fire, we cooked our supper,\r\nand were very comfortable.\r\n\r\nThe district of Cucao is the only inhabited part on the whole west\r\ncoast of Chiloe. It contains about thirty or forty Indian families, who\r\nare scattered along four or five miles of the shore. They are very much\r\nsecluded from the rest of Chiloe, and have scarcely any sort of\r\ncommerce, except sometimes in a little oil, which they get from\r\nseal-blubber. They are tolerably dressed in clothes of their own\r\nmanufacture, and they have plenty to eat. They seemed, however,\r\ndiscontented, yet humble to a degree which it was quite painful to\r\nwitness. These feelings are, I think, chiefly to be attributed to the\r\nharsh and authoritative manner in which they are treated by their\r\nrulers. Our companions, although so very civil to us, behaved to the\r\npoor Indians as if they had been slaves, rather than free men. They\r\nordered provisions and the use of their horses, without ever\r\ncondescending to say how much, or indeed whether the owners should\r\nbe paid at all. In the morning, being left alone with these poor\r\npeople, we soon ingratiated ourselves by presents of cigars and maté. A\r\nlump of white sugar was divided between all present, and tasted with\r\nthe greatest curiosity. The Indians ended all their complaints by\r\nsaying, “And it is only because we are poor Indians, and know nothing;\r\nbut it was not so when we had a King.”\r\n\r\nThe next day after breakfast we rode a few miles northward to Punta\r\nHuantamó. The road lay along a very broad beach, on which, even after\r\nso many fine days, a terrible surf was breaking. I was assured that\r\nafter a heavy gale, the roar can be heard at night even at Castro, a\r\ndistance of no less than twenty-one sea-miles across a hilly and wooded\r\ncountry. We had some difficulty in reaching the point, owing to the\r\nintolerably bad paths; for everywhere in the shade the ground soon\r\nbecomes a perfect quagmire. The point itself is a bold rocky hill. It\r\nis covered by a plant allied, I believe, to Bromelia, and called by the\r\ninhabitants Chepones. In scrambling through the beds, our hands were\r\nvery much scratched. I was amused by observing the precaution our\r\nIndian guide took, in turning up his trousers, thinking that they were\r\nmore delicate than his own hard skin. This plant bears a fruit, in\r\nshape like an artichoke, in which a number of seed-vessels are packed:\r\nthese contain a pleasant sweet pulp, here much esteemed. I saw at Low’s\r\nHarbour the Chilotans making chichi, or cider, with this fruit: so true\r\nis it, as Humboldt remarks, that almost everywhere man finds means of\r\npreparing some kind of beverage from the vegetable kingdom. The\r\nsavages, however, of Tierra del Fuego, and I believe of Australia, have\r\nnot advanced thus far in the arts.\r\n\r\nThe coast to the north of Punta Huantamó is exceedingly rugged and\r\nbroken, and is fronted by many breakers, on which the sea is eternally\r\nroaring. Mr. King and myself were anxious to return, if it had been\r\npossible, on foot along this coast; but even the Indians said it was\r\nquite impracticable. We were told that men have crossed by striking\r\ndirectly through the woods from Cucao to S. Carlos, but never by the\r\ncoast. On these expeditions, the Indians carry with them only roasted\r\ncorn, and of this they eat sparingly twice a day.\r\n\r\n26_th._—Re-embarking in the periagua, we returned across the lake, and\r\nthen mounted our horses. The whole of Chiloe took advantage of this\r\nweek of unusually fine weather, to clear\r\nthe ground by burning. In every direction volumes of smoke were curling\r\nupwards. Although the inhabitants were so assiduous in setting fire to\r\nevery part of the wood, yet I did not see a single fire which they had\r\nsucceeded in making extensive. We dined with our friend the commandant,\r\nand did not reach Castro till after dark. The next morning we started\r\nvery early. After having ridden for some time, we obtained from the\r\nbrow of a steep hill an extensive view (and it is a rare thing on this\r\nroad) of the great forest. Over the horizon of trees, the volcano of\r\nCorcovado, and the great flat-topped one to the north, stood out in\r\nproud pre-eminence: scarcely another peak in the long range showed its\r\nsnowy summit. I hope it will be long before I forget this farewell view\r\nof the magnificent Cordillera fronting Chiloe. At night we bivouacked\r\nunder a cloudless sky, and the next morning reached S. Carlos. We\r\narrived on the right day, for before evening heavy rain commenced.\r\n\r\n_February_ 4_th._—Sailed from Chiloe. During the last week I made\r\nseveral short excursions. One was to examine a great bed of\r\nnow-existing shells, elevated 350 feet above the level of the sea: from\r\namong these shells, large forest-trees were growing. Another ride was\r\nto P. Huechucucuy. I had with me a guide who knew the country far too\r\nwell; for he would pertinaciously tell me endless Indian names for\r\nevery little point, rivulet, and creek. In the same manner as in Tierra\r\ndel Fuego, the Indian language appears singularly well adapted for\r\nattaching names to the most trivial features of the land. I believe\r\nevery one was glad to say farewell to Chiloe; yet if we could forget\r\nthe gloom and ceaseless rain of winter, Chiloe might pass for a\r\ncharming island. There is also something very attractive in the\r\nsimplicity and humble politeness of the poor inhabitants.\r\n\r\nWe steered northward along shore, but owing to thick weather did not\r\nreach Valdivia till the night of the 8th. The next morning the boat\r\nproceeded to the town, which is distant about ten miles. We followed\r\nthe course of the river, occasionally passing a few hovels, and patches\r\nof ground cleared out of the otherwise unbroken forest; and sometimes\r\nmeeting a canoe with an Indian family. The town is situated on the low\r\nbanks of the stream, and is so completely buried in a wood of\r\napple-trees that the streets are merely paths in an\r\norchard. I have never seen any country where apple-trees appeared to\r\nthrive so well as in this damp part of South America: on the borders of\r\nthe roads there were many young trees evidently self-sown. In Chiloe\r\nthe inhabitants possess a marvellously short method of making an\r\norchard. At the lower part of almost every branch, small, conical,\r\nbrown, wrinkled points project: these are always ready to change into\r\nroots, as may sometimes be seen, where any mud has been accidentally\r\nsplashed against the tree. A branch as thick as a man’s thigh is chosen\r\nin the early spring, and is cut off just beneath a group of these\r\npoints, all the smaller branches are lopped off, and it is then placed\r\nabout two feet deep in the ground. During the ensuing summer the stump\r\nthrows out long shoots, and sometimes even bears fruit: I was shown one\r\nwhich had produced as many as twenty-three apples, but this was thought\r\nvery unusual. In the third season the stump is changed (as I have\r\nmyself seen) into a well-wooded tree, loaded with fruit. An old man\r\nnear Valdivia illustrated his motto, “Necesidad es la madre del\r\ninvencion,” by giving an account of the several useful things he\r\nmanufactured from his apples. After making cider, and likewise wine, he\r\nextracted from the refuse a white and finely flavoured spirit; by\r\nanother process he procured a sweet treacle, or, as he called it,\r\nhoney. His children and pigs seemed almost to live, during this season\r\nof the year, in his orchard.\r\n\r\n_February_ 11_th._—I set out with a guide on a short ride, in which,\r\nhowever, I managed to see singularly little, either of the geology of\r\nthe country or of its inhabitants. There is not much cleared land near\r\nValdivia: after crossing a river at the distance of a few miles, we\r\nentered the forest, and then passed only one miserable hovel, before\r\nreaching our sleeping-place for the night. The short difference in\r\nlatitude, of 150 miles, has given a new aspect to the forest compared\r\nwith that of Chiloe. This is owing to a slightly different proportion\r\nin the kinds of trees. The evergreens do not appear to be quite so\r\nnumerous, and the forest in consequence has a brighter tint. As in\r\nChiloe, the lower parts are matted together by canes: here also another\r\nkind (resembling the bamboo of Brazil and about twenty feet in height)\r\ngrows in clusters, and ornaments the banks of some of the streams in a\r\nvery pretty manner. It\r\nis with this plant that the Indians make their chuzos, or long tapering\r\nspears. Our resting-house was so dirty that I preferred sleeping\r\noutside: on these journeys the first night is generally very\r\nuncomfortable, because one is not accustomed to the tickling and biting\r\nof the fleas. I am sure, in the morning, there was not a space on my\r\nlegs of the size of a shilling which had not its little red mark where\r\nthe flea had feasted.\r\n\r\n12_th._—We continued to ride through the uncleared forest; only\r\noccasionally meeting an Indian on horseback, or a troop of fine mules\r\nbringing alerce-planks and corn from the southern plains. In the\r\nafternoon one of the horses knocked up; we were then on a brow of a\r\nhill, which commanded a fine view of the Llanos. The view of these open\r\nplains was very refreshing, after being hemmed in and buried in the\r\nwilderness of trees. The uniformity of a forest soon becomes very\r\nwearisome. This west coast makes me remember with pleasure the free,\r\nunbounded plains of Patagonia; yet, with the true spirit of\r\ncontradiction, I cannot forget how sublime is the silence of the\r\nforest. The Llanos are the most fertile and thickly peopled parts of\r\nthe country, as they possess the immense advantage of being nearly free\r\nfrom trees. Before leaving the forest we crossed some flat little\r\nlawns, around which single trees stood, as in an English park: I have\r\noften noticed with surprise, in wooded undulatory districts, that the\r\nquite level parts have been destitute of trees. On account of the tired\r\nhorse, I determined to stop at the Mission of Cudico, to the friar of\r\nwhich I had a letter of introduction. Cudico is an intermediate\r\ndistrict between the forest and the Llanos. There are a good many\r\ncottages, with patches of corn and potatoes, nearly all belonging to\r\nIndians. The tribes dependent on Valdivia are “reducidos y cristianos.”\r\nThe Indians farther northward, about Arauco and Imperial, are still\r\nvery wild, and not converted; but they have all much intercourse with\r\nthe Spaniards. The padre said that the Christian Indians did not much\r\nlike coming to mass, but that otherwise they showed respect for\r\nreligion. The greatest difficulty is in making them observe the\r\nceremonies of marriage. The wild Indians take as many wives as they can\r\nsupport, and a cacique will sometimes have more than ten: on entering\r\nhis house, the number may be told by that of the separate fires. Each\r\nwife lives a week in turn with the cacique;\r\nbut all are employed in weaving ponchos, etc., for his profit. To be\r\nthe wife of a cacique is an honour much sought after by the Indian\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\nThe men of all these tribes wear a coarse woolen poncho: those south of\r\nValdivia wear short trousers, and those north of it a petticoat, like\r\nthe chilipa of the Gauchos. All have their long hair bound by a scarlet\r\nfillet, but with no other covering on their heads. These Indians are\r\ngood-sized men; their cheek-bones are prominent, and in general\r\nappearance they resemble the great American family to which they\r\nbelong; but their physiognomy seemed to me to be slightly different\r\nfrom that of any other tribe which I had before seen. Their expression\r\nis generally grave, and even austere, and possesses much character:\r\nthis may pass either for honest bluntness or fierce determination. The\r\nlong black hair, the grave and much-lined features, and the dark\r\ncomplexion, called to my mind old portraits of James I. On the road we\r\nmet with none of that humble politeness so universal in Chiloe. Some\r\ngave their “mari-mari” (good morning) with promptness, but the greater\r\nnumber did not seem inclined to offer any salute. This independence of\r\nmanners is probably a consequence of their long wars, and the repeated\r\nvictories which they alone, of all the tribes in America, have gained\r\nover the Spaniards.\r\n\r\nI spent the evening very pleasantly, talking with the padre. He was\r\nexceedingly kind and hospitable; and coming from Santiago, had\r\ncontrived to surround himself with some few comforts. Being a man of\r\nsome little education, he bitterly complained of the total want of\r\nsociety. With no particular zeal for religion, no business or pursuit,\r\nhow completely must this man’s life be wasted! The next day, on our\r\nreturn, we met seven very wild-looking Indians, of whom some were\r\ncaciques that had just received from the Chilian government their\r\nyearly small stipend for having long remained faithful. They were\r\nfine-looking men, and they rode one after the other, with most gloomy\r\nfaces. An old cacique, who headed them, had been, I suppose, more\r\nexcessively drunk than the rest, for he seemed both extremely grave and\r\nvery crabbed. Shortly before this, two Indians joined us, who were\r\ntravelling from a distant mission to Valdivia concerning some lawsuit.\r\nOne was a good-humoured old man, but from his wrinkled beardless\r\nface looked more like an old woman than a man. I frequently presented\r\nboth of them with cigars; and though ready to receive them, and I\r\ndaresay grateful, they would hardly condescend to thank me. A Chilotan\r\nIndian would have taken off his hat, and given his “Dios le page!” The\r\ntravelling was very tedious, both from the badness of the roads and\r\nfrom the number of great fallen trees, which it was necessary either to\r\nleap over or to avoid by making long circuits. We slept on the road,\r\nand next morning reached Valdivia, whence I proceeded on board.\r\n\r\nA few days afterwards I crossed the bay with a party of officers, and\r\nlanded near the fort called Niebla. The buildings were in a most\r\nruinous state, and the gun-carriages quite rotten. Mr. Wickham remarked\r\nto the commanding officer, that with one discharge they would certainly\r\nall fall to pieces. The poor man, trying to put a good face upon it,\r\ngravely replied, “No, I am sure, sir, they would stand two!” The\r\nSpaniards must have intended to have made this place impregnable. There\r\nis now lying in the middle of the courtyard a little mountain of\r\nmortar, which rivals in hardness the rock on which it is placed. It was\r\nbrought from Chile, and cost 7000 dollars. The revolution having broken\r\nout prevented its being applied to any purpose, and now it remains a\r\nmonument of the fallen greatness of Spain.\r\n\r\nI wanted to go to a house about a mile and a half distant, but my guide\r\nsaid it was quite impossible to penetrate the wood in a straight line.\r\nHe offered, however, to lead me, by following obscure cattle-tracks,\r\nthe shortest way: the walk, nevertheless, took no less than three\r\nhours! This man is employed in hunting strayed cattle; yet, well as he\r\nmust know the woods, he was not long since lost for two whole days, and\r\nhad nothing to eat. These facts convey a good idea of the\r\nimpracticability of the forests of these countries. A question often\r\noccurred to me—how long does any vestige of a fallen tree remain? This\r\nman showed me one which a party of fugitive royalists had cut down\r\nfourteen years ago; and taking this as a criterion, I should think a\r\nbole a foot and a half in diameter would in thirty years be changed\r\ninto a heap of mould.\r\n\r\n_February_ 20_th._—This day has been memorable in the annals of\r\nValdivia, for the most severe earthquake experienced\r\nby the oldest inhabitant. I happened to be on shore, and was lying down\r\nin the wood to rest myself. It came on suddenly, and lasted two\r\nminutes, but the time appeared much longer. The rocking of the ground\r\nwas very sensible. The undulations appeared to my companion and myself\r\nto come from due east, whilst others thought they proceeded from\r\nsouth-west: this shows how difficult it sometimes is to perceive the\r\ndirection of the vibrations. There was no difficulty in standing\r\nupright, but the motion made me almost giddy: it was something like the\r\nmovement of a vessel in a little cross-ripple, or still more like that\r\nfelt by a person skating over thin ice, which bends under the weight of\r\nhis body.\r\n\r\nA bad earthquake at once destroys our oldest associations: the earth,\r\nthe very emblem of solidity, has moved beneath our feet like a thin\r\ncrust over a fluid;—one second of time has created in the mind a\r\nstrange idea of insecurity, which hours of reflection would not have\r\nproduced. In the forest, as a breeze moved the trees, I felt only the\r\nearth tremble, but saw no other effect. Captain Fitz Roy and some\r\nofficers were at the town during the shock, and there the scene was\r\nmore striking; for although the houses, from being built of wood, did\r\nnot fall, they were violently shaken, and the boards creaked and\r\nrattled together. The people rushed out of doors in the greatest alarm.\r\nIt is these accompaniments that create that perfect horror of\r\nearthquakes, experienced by all who have thus seen, as well as felt,\r\ntheir effects. Within the forest it was a deeply interesting, but by no\r\nmeans an awe-exciting phenomenon. The tides were very curiously\r\naffected. The great shock took place at the time of low water; and an\r\nold woman who was on the beach told me that the water flowed very\r\nquickly, but not in great waves, to high-water mark, and then as\r\nquickly returned to its proper level; this was also evident by the line\r\nof wet sand. The same kind of quick but quiet movement in the tide\r\nhappened a few years since at Chiloe, during a slight earthquake, and\r\ncreated much causeless alarm. In the course of the evening there were\r\nmany weaker shocks, which seemed to produce in the harbour the most\r\ncomplicated currents, and some of great strength.\r\n\r\n\r\n_March_ 4_th._—We entered the harbour of Concepcion.\r\nWhile the ship was beating up to the anchorage, I landed on the island\r\nof Quiriquina. The mayor-domo of the estate quickly rode down to tell\r\nme the terrible news of the great earthquake of the 20th:—“That not a\r\nhouse in Concepcion or Talcahuano (the port) was standing; that seventy\r\nvillages were destroyed; and that a great wave had almost washed away\r\nthe ruins of Talcahuano.” Of this latter statement I soon saw abundant\r\nproofs—the whole coast being strewed over with timber and furniture as\r\nif a thousand ships had been wrecked. Besides chairs, tables,\r\nbook-shelves, etc., in great numbers, there were several roofs of\r\ncottages, which had been transported almost whole. The storehouses at\r\nTalcahuano had been burst open, and great bags of cotton, yerba, and\r\nother valuable merchandise were scattered on the shore. During my walk\r\nround the island, I observed that numerous fragments of rock, which,\r\nfrom the marine productions adhering to them, must recently have been\r\nlying in deep water, had been cast up high on the beach; one of these\r\nwas six feet long, three broad, and two thick.\r\n\r\nThe island itself as plainly showed the overwhelming power of the\r\nearthquake, as the beach did that of the consequent great wave. The\r\nground in many parts was fissured in north and south lines, perhaps\r\ncaused by the yielding of the parallel and steep sides of this narrow\r\nisland. Some of the fissures near the cliffs were a yard wide. Many\r\nenormous masses had already fallen on the beach; and the inhabitants\r\nthought that when the rains commenced far greater slips would happen.\r\nThe effect of the vibration on the hard primary slate, which composes\r\nthe foundation of the island, was still more curious: the superficial\r\nparts of some narrow ridges were as completely shivered as if they had\r\nbeen blasted by gunpowder. This effect, which was rendered conspicuous\r\nby the fresh fractures and displaced soil, must be confined to near the\r\nsurface, for otherwise there would not exist a block of solid rock\r\nthroughout Chile; nor is this improbable, as it is known that the\r\nsurface of a vibrating body is affected differently from the central\r\npart. It is, perhaps, owing to this same reason that earthquakes do not\r\ncause quite such terrific havoc within deep mines as would be expected.\r\nI believe this convulsion has been more effectual in lessening the size\r\nof the island of\r\nQuiriquina, than the ordinary wear-and-tear of the sea and weather\r\nduring the course of a whole century.\r\n\r\nThe next day I landed at Talcahuano, and afterwards rode to Concepcion.\r\nBoth towns presented the most awful yet interesting spectacle I ever\r\nbeheld. To a person who had formerly known them, it possibly might have\r\nbeen still more impressive; for the ruins were so mingled together, and\r\nthe whole scene possessed so little the air of a habitable place, that\r\nit was scarcely possible to imagine its former condition. The\r\nearthquake commenced at half-past eleven o’clock in the forenoon. If it\r\nhad happened in the middle of the night, the greater number of the\r\ninhabitants (which in this one province amount to many thousands) must\r\nhave perished, instead of less than a hundred: as it was, the\r\ninvariable practice of running out of doors at the first trembling of\r\nthe ground, alone saved them. In Concepcion each house, or row of\r\nhouses, stood by itself, a heap or line of ruins; but in Talcahuano,\r\nowing to the great wave, little more than one layer of bricks, tiles,\r\nand timber, with here and there part of a wall left standing, could be\r\ndistinguished. From this circumstance Concepcion, although not so\r\ncompletely desolated, was a more terrible, and if I may so call it,\r\npicturesque sight. The first shock was very sudden. The mayor-domo at\r\nQuiriquina told me that the first notice he received of it, was finding\r\nboth the horse he rode and himself rolling together on the ground.\r\nRising up, he was again thrown down. He also told me that some cows\r\nwhich were standing on the steep side of the island were rolled into\r\nthe sea. The great wave caused the destruction of many cattle; on one\r\nlow island near the head of the bay, seventy animals were washed off\r\nand drowned. It is generally thought that this has been the worst\r\nearthquake ever recorded in Chile; but as the very severe ones occur\r\nonly after long intervals, this cannot easily be known; nor indeed\r\nwould a much worse shock have made any great difference, for the ruin\r\nwas now complete. Innumerable small tremblings followed the great\r\nearthquake, and within the first twelve days no less than three hundred\r\nwere counted.\r\n\r\nAfter viewing Concepcion, I cannot understand how the greater number of\r\ninhabitants escaped unhurt. The houses in many parts fell outwards;\r\nthus forming in the middle of the\r\nstreets little hillocks of brickwork and rubbish. Mr. Rouse, the\r\nEnglish consul, told us that he was at breakfast when the first\r\nmovement warned him to run out. He had scarcely reached the middle of\r\nthe courtyard, when one side of his house came thundering down. He\r\nretained presence of mind to remember that, if he once got on the top\r\nof that part which had already fallen, he would be safe. Not being able\r\nfrom the motion of the ground to stand, he crawled up on his hands and\r\nknees; and no sooner had he ascended this little eminence, than the\r\nother side of the house fell in, the great beams sweeping close in\r\nfront of his head. With his eyes blinded and his mouth choked with the\r\ncloud of dust which darkened the sky, at last he gained the street. As\r\nshock succeeded shock, at the interval of a few minutes, no one dared\r\napproach the shattered ruins, and no one knew whether his dearest\r\nfriends and relations were not perishing from the want of help. Those\r\nwho had saved any property were obliged to keep a constant watch, for\r\nthieves prowled about, and at each little trembling of the ground, with\r\none hand they beat their breasts and cried “misericordia!” and then\r\nwith the other filched what they could from the ruins. The thatched\r\nroofs fell over the fires, and flames burst forth in all parts.\r\nHundreds knew themselves ruined, and few had the means of providing\r\nfood for the day.\r\n\r\nEarthquakes alone are sufficient to destroy the prosperity of any\r\ncountry. If beneath England the now inert subterranean forces should\r\nexert those powers which most assuredly in former geological ages they\r\nhave exerted, how completely would the entire condition of the country\r\nbe changed! What would become of the lofty houses, thickly packed\r\ncities, great manufactories, the beautiful public and private edifices?\r\nIf the new period of disturbance were first to commence by some great\r\nearthquake in the dead of the night, how terrific would be the carnage!\r\nEngland would at once be bankrupt; all papers, records, and accounts\r\nwould from that moment be lost. Government being unable to collect the\r\ntaxes, and failing to maintain its authority, the hand of violence and\r\nrapine would remain uncontrolled. In every large town famine would go\r\nforth, pestilence and death following in its train.\r\n\r\nShortly after the shock, a great wave was seen from the\r\ndistance of three or four miles, approaching in the middle of the bay\r\nwith a smooth outline; but along the shore it tore up cottages and\r\ntrees, as it swept onwards with irresistible force. At the head of the\r\nbay it broke in a fearful line of white breakers, which rushed up to a\r\nheight of 23 vertical feet above the highest spring-tides. Their force\r\nmust have been prodigious; for at the Fort a cannon with its carriage,\r\nestimated at four tons in weight, was moved 15 feet inwards. A schooner\r\nwas left in the midst of the ruins, 200 yards from the beach. The first\r\nwave was followed by two others, which in their retreat carried away a\r\nvast wreck of floating objects. In one part of the bay, a ship was\r\npitched high and dry on shore, was carried off, again driven on shore,\r\nand again carried off. In another part two large vessels anchored near\r\ntogether were whirled about, and their cables were thrice wound round\r\neach other: though anchored at a depth of 36 feet, they were for some\r\nminutes aground. The great wave must have travelled slowly, for the\r\ninhabitants of Talcahuano had time to run up the hills behind the town;\r\nand some sailors pulled out seaward, trusting successfully to their\r\nboat riding securely over the swell, if they could reach it before it\r\nbroke. One old woman with a little boy, four or five years old, ran\r\ninto a boat, but there was nobody to row it out: the boat was\r\nconsequently dashed against an anchor and cut in twain; the old woman\r\nwas drowned, but the child was picked up some hours afterwards clinging\r\nto the wreck. Pools of salt-water were still standing amidst the ruins\r\nof the houses, and children, making boats with old tables and chairs,\r\nappeared as happy as their parents were miserable. It was, however,\r\nexceedingly interesting to observe, how much more active and cheerful\r\nall appeared than could have been expected. It was remarked with much\r\ntruth, that from the destruction being universal, no one individual was\r\nhumbled more than another, or could suspect his friends of\r\ncoldness—that most grievous result of the loss of wealth. Mr. Rouse,\r\nand a large party whom he kindly took under his protection, lived for\r\nthe first week in a garden beneath some apple-trees. At first they were\r\nas merry as if it had been a picnic; but soon afterwards heavy rain\r\ncaused much discomfort, for they were absolutely without shelter.\r\n\r\nIn Captain Fitz Roy’s excellent account of the earthquake it is said\r\nthat two explosions, one like a column of smoke and\r\nanother like the blowing of a great whale, were seen in the bay. The\r\nwater also appeared everywhere to be boiling; and it “became black, and\r\nexhaled a most disagreeable sulphureous smell.” These latter\r\ncircumstances were observed in the Bay of Valparaiso during the\r\nearthquake of 1822; they may, I think, be accounted for by the\r\ndisturbance of the mud at the bottom of the sea containing organic\r\nmatter in decay. In the Bay of Callao, during a calm day, I noticed,\r\nthat as the ship dragged her cable over the bottom, its course was\r\nmarked by a line of bubbles. The lower orders in Talcahuano thought\r\nthat the earthquake was caused by some old Indian women, who two years\r\nago, being offended, stopped the volcano of Antuco. This silly belief\r\nis curious, because it shows that experience has taught them to observe\r\nthat there exists a relation between the suppressed action of the\r\nvolcanos, and the trembling of the ground. It was necessary to apply\r\nthe witchcraft to the point where their perception of cause and effect\r\nfailed; and this was the closing of the volcanic vent. This belief is\r\nthe more singular in this particular instance because, according to\r\nCaptain Fitz Roy, there is reason to believe that Antuco was noways\r\naffected.\r\n\r\nThe town of Concepcion was built in the usual Spanish fashion, with all\r\nthe streets running at right angles to each other; one set ranging\r\nsouth-west by west, and the other set north-west by north. The walls in\r\nthe former direction certainly stood better than those in the latter;\r\nthe greater number of the masses of brickwork were thrown down towards\r\nthe N.E. Both these circumstances perfectly agree with the general idea\r\nof the undulations having come from the S.W.; in which quarter\r\nsubterranean noises were also heard; for it is evident that the walls\r\nrunning S.W. and N.E. which presented their ends to the point whence\r\nthe undulations came, would be much less likely to fall than those\r\nwalls which, running N.W. and S.E., must in their whole lengths have\r\nbeen at the same instant thrown out of the perpendicular; for the\r\nundulations, coming from the S.W., must have extended in N.W. and S.E.\r\nwaves, as they passed under the foundations. This may be illustrated by\r\nplacing books edgeways on a carpet, and then, after the manner\r\nsuggested by Michell, imitating the undulations of an earthquake: it\r\nwill be found that they fall with more or less\r\nreadiness, according as their direction more or less nearly coincides\r\nwith the line of the waves. The fissures in the ground generally,\r\nthough not uniformly, extended in a S.E. and N.W. direction, and\r\ntherefore corresponded to the lines of undulation or of principal\r\nflexure. Bearing in mind all these circumstances, which so clearly\r\npoint to the S.W. as the chief focus of disturbance, it is a very\r\ninteresting fact that the island of S. Maria, situated in that quarter,\r\nwas, during the general uplifting of the land, raised to nearly three\r\ntimes the height of any other part of the coast.\r\n\r\nThe different resistance offered by the walls, according to their\r\ndirection, was well exemplified in the case of the Cathedral. The side\r\nwhich fronted the N.E. presented a grand pile of ruins, in the midst of\r\nwhich door-cases and masses of timber stood up, as if floating in a\r\nstream. Some of the angular blocks of brickwork were of great\r\ndimensions; and they were rolled to a distance on the level plaza, like\r\nfragments of rock at the base of some high mountain. The side walls\r\n(running S.W. and N.E.), though exceedingly fractured, yet remained\r\nstanding; but the vast buttresses (at right angles to them, and\r\ntherefore parallel to the walls that fell) were in many cases cut clean\r\noff, as if by a chisel, and hurled to the ground. Some square ornaments\r\non the coping of these same walls were moved by the earthquake into a\r\ndiagonal position. A similar circumstance was observed after an\r\nearthquake at Valparaiso, Calabria, and other places, including some of\r\nthe ancient Greek temples.[1] This twisting displacement at first\r\nappears to indicate a vorticose movement beneath each point thus\r\naffected; but this is highly improbable. May it not be caused by a\r\ntendency in each stone to arrange itself in some particular position\r\nwith respect to the lines of vibration,—in a manner somewhat similar to\r\npins on a sheet of paper when shaken? Generally speaking, arched\r\ndoorways or windows stood much better than any other part of the\r\nbuildings. Nevertheless, a poor lame old man, who had been in the\r\nhabit, during trifling shocks, of crawling to a certain doorway, was\r\nthis time crushed to pieces.\r\n\r\n [1] M. Arago in _L’Institut_, 1839, p. 337. See also Miers’s _Chile_,\r\n vol. i, p. 392; also Lyell’s _ Principles of Geology_, chap. xv, book\r\n ii.\r\n\r\nI have not attempted to give any detailed description of the appearance\r\nof Concepcion, for I feel that it is quite\r\nimpossible to convey the mingled feelings which I experienced. Several\r\nof the officers visited it before me, but their strongest language\r\nfailed to give a just idea of the scene of desolation. It is a bitter\r\nand humiliating thing to see works, which have cost man so much time\r\nand labour, overthrown in one minute; yet compassion for the\r\ninhabitants was almost instantly banished, by the surprise in seeing a\r\nstate of things produced in a moment of time, which one was accustomed\r\nto attribute to a succession of ages. In my opinion, we have scarcely\r\nbeheld, since leaving England, any sight so deeply interesting.\r\n\r\nIn almost every severe earthquake, the neighbouring waters of the sea\r\nare said to have been greatly agitated. The disturbance seems\r\ngenerally, as in the case of Concepcion, to have been of two kinds:\r\nfirst, at the instant of the shock, the water swells high up on the\r\nbeach with a gentle motion, and then as quietly retreats; secondly,\r\nsome time afterwards, the whole body of the sea retires from the coast,\r\nand then returns in waves of overwhelming force. The first movement\r\nseems to be an immediate consequence of the earthquake affecting\r\ndifferently a fluid and a solid, so that their respective levels are\r\nslightly deranged: but the second case is a far more important\r\nphenomenon. During most earthquakes, and especially during those on the\r\nwest coast of America, it is certain that the first great movement of\r\nthe waters has been a retirement. Some authors have attempted to\r\nexplain this, by supposing that the water retains its level, whilst the\r\nland oscillates upwards; but surely the water close to the land, even\r\non a rather steep coast, would partake of the motion of the bottom:\r\nmoreover, as urged by Mr. Lyell, similar movements of the sea have\r\noccurred at islands far distant from the chief line of disturbance, as\r\nwas the case with Juan Fernandez during this earthquake, and with\r\nMadeira during the famous Lisbon shock. I suspect (but the subject is a\r\nvery obscure one) that a wave, however produced, first draws the water\r\nfrom the shore, on which it is advancing to break: I have observed that\r\nthis happens with the little waves from the paddles of a steam-boat. It\r\nis remarkable that whilst Talcahuano and Callao (near Lima), both\r\nsituated at the head of large shallow bays, have suffered during every\r\nsevere earthquake from great waves, Valparaiso, seated close to the\r\nedge of profoundly deep water, has never\r\nbeen overwhelmed, though so often shaken by the severest shocks. From\r\nthe great wave not immediately following the earthquake, but sometimes\r\nafter the interval of even half an hour, and from distant islands being\r\naffected similarly with the coasts near the focus of the disturbance,\r\nit appears that the wave first rises in the offing; and as this is of\r\ngeneral occurrence, the cause must be general: I suspect we must look\r\nto the line where the less disturbed waters of the deep ocean join the\r\nwater nearer the coast, which has partaken of the movements of the\r\nland, as the place where the great wave is first generated; it would\r\nalso appear that the wave is larger or smaller, according to the extent\r\nof shoal water which has been agitated together with the bottom on\r\nwhich it rested.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable effect of this earthquake was the permanent\r\nelevation of the land; it would probably be far more correct to speak\r\nof it as the cause. There can be no doubt that the land round the Bay\r\nof Concepcion was upraised two or three feet; but it deserves notice,\r\nthat owing to the wave having obliterated the old lines of tidal action\r\non the sloping sandy shores, I could discover no evidence of this fact,\r\nexcept in the united testimony of the inhabitants, that one little\r\nrocky shoal, now exposed, was formerly covered with water. At the\r\nisland of S. Maria (about thirty miles distant) the elevation was\r\ngreater; on one part, Captain Fitz Roy found beds of putrid\r\nmussel-shells _still adhering to the rocks,_ ten feet above high-water\r\nmark: the inhabitants had formerly dived at lower-water spring-tides\r\nfor these shells. The elevation of this province is particularly\r\ninteresting, from its having been the theatre of several other violent\r\nearthquakes, and from the vast numbers of sea-shells scattered over the\r\nland, up to a height of certainly 600, and I believe, of 1000 feet. At\r\nValparaiso, as I have remarked, similar shells are found at the height\r\nof 1300 feet: it is hardly possible to doubt that this great elevation\r\nhas been effected by successive small uprisings, such as that which\r\naccompanied or caused the earthquake of this year, and likewise by an\r\ninsensibly slow rise, which is certainly in progress on some parts of\r\nthis coast.\r\n\r\nThe island of Juan Fernandez, 360 miles to the N.E., was, at the time\r\nof the great shock of the 20th, violently shaken, so\r\nthat the trees beat against each other, and a volcano burst forth under\r\nwater close to the shore: these facts are remarkable because this\r\nisland, during the earthquake of 1751, was then also affected more\r\nviolently than other places at an equal distance from Concepcion, and\r\nthis seems to show some subterranean connexion between these two\r\npoints. Chiloe, about 340 miles southward of Concepcion, appears to\r\nhave been shaken more strongly than the intermediate district of\r\nValdivia, where the volcano of Villarica was noways affected, whilst in\r\nthe Cordillera in front of Chiloe two of the volcanos burst forth at\r\nthe same instant in violent action. These two volcanos, and some\r\nneighbouring ones, continued for a long time in eruption, and ten\r\nmonths afterwards were again influenced by an earthquake at Concepcion.\r\nSome men cutting wood near the base of one of these volcanos, did not\r\nperceive the shock of the 20th, although the whole surrounding Province\r\nwas then trembling; here we have an eruption relieving and taking the\r\nplace of an earthquake, as would have happened at Concepcion, according\r\nto the belief of the lower orders, if the volcano at Antuco had not\r\nbeen closed by witchcraft. Two years and three-quarters afterwards\r\nValdivia and Chiloe were again shaken, more violently than on the 20th,\r\nand an island in the Chonos Archipelago was permanently elevated more\r\nthan eight feet. It will give a better idea of the scale of these\r\nphenomena, if (as in the case of the glaciers) we suppose them to have\r\ntaken place at corresponding distances in Europe:—then would the land\r\nfrom the North Sea to the Mediterranean have been violently shaken, and\r\nat the same instant of time a large tract of the eastern coast of\r\nEngland would have been permanently elevated, together with some\r\noutlying islands,—a train of volcanos on the coast of Holland would\r\nhave burst forth in action, and an eruption taken place at the bottom\r\nof the sea, near the northern extremity of Ireland—and lastly, the\r\nancient vents of Auvergne, Cantal, and Mont d’Or would each have sent\r\nup to the sky a dark column of smoke, and have long remained in fierce\r\naction. Two years and three-quarters afterwards, France, from its\r\ncentre to the English Channel, would have been again desolated by an\r\nearthquake, and an island permanently upraised in the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe space, from under which volcanic matter on the 20th was actually\r\nerupted, is 720 miles in one line, and 400 miles in another line at\r\nright angles to the first: hence, in all probability, a subterranean\r\nlake of lava is here stretched out, of nearly double the area of the\r\nBlack Sea. From the intimate and complicated manner in which the\r\nelevatory and eruptive forces were shown to be connected during this\r\ntrain of phenomena, we may confidently come to the conclusion that the\r\nforces which slowly and by little starts uplift continents, and those\r\nwhich at successive periods pour forth volcanic matter from open\r\norifices, are identical. From many reasons, I believe that the frequent\r\nquakings of the earth on this line of coast are caused by the rending\r\nof the strata, necessarily consequent on the tension of the land when\r\nupraised, and their injection by fluidified rock. This rending and\r\ninjection would, if repeated often enough (and we know that earthquakes\r\nrepeatedly affect the same areas in the same manner), form a chain of\r\nhills;—and the linear island of St. Mary, which was upraised thrice the\r\nheight of the neighbouring country, seems to be undergoing this\r\nprocess. I believe that the solid axis of a mountain differs in its\r\nmanner of formation from a volcanic hill, only in the molten stone\r\nhaving been repeatedly injected, instead of having been repeatedly\r\nejected. Moreover, I believe that it is impossible to explain the\r\nstructure of great mountain-chains, such as that of the Cordillera,\r\nwhere the strata, capping the injected axis of plutonic rock, have been\r\nthrown on their edges along several parallel and neighbouring lines of\r\nelevation, except on this view of the rock of the axis having been\r\nrepeatedly injected, after intervals sufficiently long to allow the\r\nupper parts or wedges to cool and become solid;—for if the strata had\r\nbeen thrown into their present highly-inclined, vertical, and even\r\ninverted positions, by a single blow, the very bowels of the earth\r\nwould have gushed out; and instead of beholding abrupt mountain-axes of\r\nrock solidified under great pressure, deluges of lava would have flowed\r\nout at innumerable points on every line of elevation.[2]\r\n\r\n [2] For a full account of the volcanic phenomena which accompanied the\r\n earthquake of the 20th, and for the conclusions deducible from them, I\r\n must refer to Volume V of the _Geological Transactions._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Hide Bridge, Santiago de Chile]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XV\r\n\r\n\r\nValparaiso—Portillo Pass—Sagacity of mules—Mountain-torrents—Mines, how\r\ndiscovered—Proofs of the gradual elevation of the Cordillera—Effect of\r\nsnow on rocks—Geological structure of the two main ranges, their\r\ndistinct origin and upheaval—Great subsidence—Red snow—Winds—Pinnacles\r\nof snow—Dry and clear atmosphere—Electricity—Pampas—Zoology of the\r\nopposite sides of the Andes—Locusts—Great Bugs—Mendoza—Uspallata\r\nPass—Silicified trees buried as they grew—Incas Bridge—Badness of the\r\npasses exaggerated—Cumbre—Casuchas—Valparaiso.\r\n\r\nPASSAGE OF THE CORDILLERA\r\n\r\n_March_ 7_th_, 1835.—We stayed three days at Concepcion, and then\r\nsailed for Valparaiso. The wind being northerly, we only reached the\r\nmouth of the harbour of Concepcion before it was dark. Being very near\r\nthe land, and a fog coming on, the anchor was dropped. Presently a\r\nlarge American whaler appeared close alongside of us; and we heard the\r\nYankee swearing at his men to keep quiet, whilst he listened for the\r\nbreakers. Captain Fitz Roy hailed him, in a loud clear voice, to anchor\r\nwhere he then was. The poor man must have thought the voice came from\r\nthe shore: such a Babel of cries issued at once from the ship—every one\r\nhallooing out, “Let go the anchor! veer cable! shorten sail!” It was\r\nthe most laughable thing I ever heard. If the ship’s crew had been all\r\ncaptains, and no men, there could not have been a greater uproar of\r\norders. We afterwards found that the mate stuttered: I suppose all\r\nhands were assisting him in giving his orders.\r\n\r\nOn the 11th we anchored at Valparaiso, and two days afterwards I set\r\nout to cross the Cordillera. I proceeded to Santiago, where Mr.\r\nCaldcleugh most kindly assisted me in every possible way in making the\r\nlittle preparations which were necessary. In this part of Chile there\r\nare two passes across the Andes to Mendoza: the one most commonly used,\r\nnamely, that of Aconcagua or Uspallata—is situated some way to the\r\nnorth; the other, called the Portillo, is to the south, and nearer, but\r\nmore lofty and dangerous.\r\n\r\n\r\n_March_ 18_th._—We set out for the Portillo pass. Leaving Santiago we\r\ncrossed the wide burnt-up plain on which that city stands, and in the\r\nafternoon arrived at the Maypu, one of the principal rivers in Chile.\r\nThe valley, at the point where it enters the first Cordillera, is\r\nbounded on each side by lofty barren mountains; and although not broad,\r\nit is very fertile. Numerous cottages were surrounded by vines, and by\r\norchards of apple, nectarine, and peach-trees—their boughs breaking\r\nwith the weight of the beautiful ripe fruit. In the evening we passed\r\nthe custom-house, where our luggage was examined. The frontier of Chile\r\nis better guarded by the Cordillera than by the waters of the sea.\r\nThere are very few valleys which lead to the central ranges, and the\r\nmountains are quite impassable in other parts by beasts of burden. The\r\ncustom-house officers were very civil, which was perhaps partly owing\r\nto the passport which the President of the Republic had given me; but I\r\nmust express my admiration at the natural politeness of almost every\r\nChileno. In this instance, the contrast with the same class of men in\r\nmost other countries was strongly marked. I may mention an anecdote\r\nwith which I was at the time much pleased: we met near Mendoza a little\r\nand very fat negress,\r\nriding astride on a mule. She had a _goître_ so enormous that it was\r\nscarcely possible to avoid gazing at her for a moment; but my two\r\ncompanions almost instantly, by way of apology, made the common salute\r\nof the country by taking off their hats. Where would one of the lower\r\nor higher classes in Europe have shown such feeling politeness to a\r\npoor and miserable object of a degraded race?\r\n\r\nAt night we slept at a cottage. Our manner of travelling was\r\ndelightfully independent. In the inhabited parts we bought a little\r\nfirewood, hired pasture for the animals, and bivouacked in the corner\r\nof the same field with them. Carrying an iron pot, we cooked and ate\r\nour supper under a cloudless sky, and knew no trouble. My companions\r\nwere Mariano Gonzales, who had formerly accompanied me in Chile, and an\r\n“arriero,” with his ten mules and a “madrina.” The madrina (or\r\ngodmother) is a most important personage: she is an old steady mare,\r\nwith a little bell round her neck; and wherever she goes, the mules,\r\nlike good children, follow her. The affection of these animals for\r\ntheir madrinas saves infinite trouble. If several large troops are\r\nturned into one field to graze, in the morning the muleteers have only\r\nto lead the madrinas a little apart, and tinkle their bells; and\r\nalthough there may be two or three hundred together, each mule\r\nimmediately knows the bell of its own madrina, and comes to her. It is\r\nnearly impossible to lose an old mule; for if detained for several\r\nhours by force, she will, by the power of smell, like a dog, track out\r\nher companions, or rather the madrina, for, according to the muleteer,\r\nshe is the chief object of affection. The feeling, however, is not of\r\nan individual nature; for I believe I am right in saying that any\r\nanimal with a bell will serve as a madrina. In a troop each animal\r\ncarries on a level road, a cargo weighing 416 pounds (more than 29\r\nstone), but in a mountainous country 100 pounds less; yet with what\r\ndelicate slim limbs, without any proportional bulk of muscle, these\r\nanimals support so great a burden! The mule always appears to me a most\r\nsurprising animal. That a hybrid should possess more reason, memory,\r\nobstinacy, social affection, powers of muscular endurance, and length\r\nof life, than either of its parents, seems to indicate that art has\r\nhere outdone nature. Of our ten animals, six were intended for riding,\r\nand four for carrying cargoes, each taking turn about. We carried a\r\ngood\r\ndeal of food in case we should be snowed up, as the season was rather\r\nlate for passing the Portillo.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n_March_ 19_th._—We rode during this day to the last, and therefore most\r\nelevated, house in the valley. The number of inhabitants became scanty;\r\nbut wherever water could be brought on the land, it was very fertile.\r\nAll the main valleys in the Cordillera are characterised by having, on\r\nboth sides, a fringe or terrace of shingle and sand, rudely stratified,\r\nand generally of considerable thickness. These fringes evidently once\r\nextended across the valleys and were united; and the bottoms of the\r\nvalleys in northern Chile, where there are no streams, are thus\r\nsmoothly filled up. On these fringes the roads are generally carried,\r\nfor their surfaces are even, and they rise with a very gentle slope up\r\nthe valleys: hence, also, they are easily cultivated by irrigation.\r\nThey may be traced up to a height of between 7000 and 9000 feet, where\r\nthey become hidden by the irregular piles of debris. At the lower end\r\nor mouths of the valleys they are continuously united to those\r\nland-locked plains (also formed of shingle) at the foot of the main\r\nCordillera, which I have described in a former chapter as\r\ncharacteristic of the scenery of Chile, and which were undoubtedly\r\ndeposited when the sea penetrated Chile, as it now does the more\r\nsouthern coasts. No one fact in the geology of South America interested\r\nme more than these terraces of rudely-stratified shingle. They\r\nprecisely resemble in composition the matter which the torrents in each\r\nvalley would deposit if they were checked in\r\ntheir course by any cause, such as entering a lake or arm of the sea;\r\nbut the torrents, instead of depositing matter, are now steadily at\r\nwork wearing away both the solid rock and these alluvial deposits,\r\nalong the whole line of every main valley and side valley. It is\r\nimpossible here to give the reasons, but I am convinced that the\r\nshingle terraces were accumulated, during the gradual elevation of the\r\nCordillera, by the torrents delivering, at successive levels, their\r\ndetritus on the beach-heads of long narrow arms of the sea, first high\r\nup the valleys, then lower and lower down as the land slowly rose. If\r\nthis be so, and I cannot doubt it, the grand and broken chain of the\r\nCordillera, instead of having been suddenly thrown up, as was till\r\nlately the universal, and still is the common opinion of geologists,\r\nhas been slowly upheaved in mass, in the same gradual manner as the\r\ncoasts of the Atlantic and Pacific have risen within the recent period.\r\nA multitude of facts in the structure of the Cordillera, on this view\r\nreceive a simple explanation.\r\n\r\nSouth American bit\r\n\r\nThe rivers which flow in these valleys ought rather to be called\r\nmountain-torrents. Their inclination is very great, and their water the\r\ncolour of mud. The roar which the Maypu made, as it rushed over the\r\ngreat rounded fragments, was like that of the sea. Amidst the din of\r\nrushing waters, the noise from the\r\nstones, as they rattled one over another, was most distinctly audible\r\neven from a distance. This rattling noise, night and day, may be heard\r\nalong the whole course of the torrent. The sound spoke eloquently to\r\nthe geologist; the thousands and thousands of stones which, striking\r\nagainst each other, made the one dull uniform sound, were all hurrying\r\nin one direction. It was like thinking on time, where the minute that\r\nnow glides past is irrevocable. So was it with these stones; the ocean\r\nis their eternity, and each note of that wild music told of one more\r\nstep towards their destiny.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible for the mind to comprehend, except by a slow\r\nprocess, any effect which is produced by a cause repeated so often that\r\nthe multiplier itself conveys an idea not more definite than the savage\r\nimplies when he points to the hairs of his head. As often as I have\r\nseen beds of mud, sand, and shingle, accumulated to the thickness of\r\nmany thousand feet, I have felt inclined to exclaim that causes, such\r\nas the present rivers and the present beaches, could never have ground\r\ndown and produced such masses. But, on the other hand, when listening\r\nto the rattling noise of these torrents, and calling to mind that whole\r\nraces of animals have passed away from the face of the earth, and that\r\nduring this whole period, night and day, these stones have gone\r\nrattling onwards in their course, I have thought to myself, can any\r\nmountains, any continent, withstand such waste?\r\n\r\nIn this part of the valley, the mountains on each side were from 3000\r\nto 6000 or 8000 feet high, with rounded outlines and steep bare flanks.\r\nThe general colour of the rock was dullish purple, and the\r\nstratification very distinct. If the scenery was not beautiful, it was\r\nremarkable and grand. We met during the day several herds of cattle,\r\nwhich men were driving down from the higher valleys in the Cordillera.\r\nThis sign of the approaching winter hurried our steps, more than was\r\nconvenient for geologising. The house where we slept was situated at\r\nthe foot of a mountain, on the summit of which are the mines of S.\r\nPedro de Nolasko. Sir F. Head marvels how mines have been discovered in\r\nsuch extraordinary situations, as the bleak summit of the mountain of\r\nS. Pedro de Nolasko. In the first place, metallic veins in this country\r\nare generally harder than the surrounding strata: hence, during the\r\ngradual\r\nwear of the hills, they project above the surface of the ground.\r\nSecondly, almost every labourer, especially in the northern parts of\r\nChile, understands something about the appearance of ores. In the great\r\nmining provinces of Coquimbo and Copiapó, firewood is very scarce, and\r\nmen search for it over every hill and dale; and by this means nearly\r\nall the richest mines have there been discovered. Chanuncillo, from\r\nwhich silver to the value of many hundred thousand pounds has been\r\nraised in the course of a few years, was discovered by a man who threw\r\na stone at his loaded donkey, and thinking that it was very heavy, he\r\npicked it up, and found it full of pure silver: the vein occurred at no\r\ngreat distance, standing up like a wedge of metal. The miners, also,\r\ntaking a crowbar with them, often wander on Sundays over the mountains.\r\nIn this south part of Chile the men who drive cattle into the\r\nCordillera, and who frequent every ravine where there is a little\r\npasture, are the usual discoverers.\r\n\r\n20_th._—As we ascended the valley, the vegetation, with the exception\r\nof a few pretty alpine flowers, became exceedingly scanty; and of\r\nquadrupeds, birds, or insects, scarcely one could be seen. The lofty\r\nmountains, their summits marked with a few patches of snow, stood well\r\nseparated from each other; the valleys being filled up with an immense\r\nthickness of stratified alluvium. The features in the scenery of the\r\nAndes which struck me most, as contrasted with the other mountain\r\nchains with which I am acquainted, were,—the flat fringes sometimes\r\nexpanding into narrow plains on each side of the valleys,—the bright\r\ncolours, chiefly red and purple, of the utterly bare and precipitous\r\nhills of porphyry, the grand and continuous wall-like dikes,—the\r\nplainly-divided strata which, where nearly vertical, formed the\r\npicturesque and wild central pinnacles, but where less inclined,\r\ncomposed the great massive mountains on the outskirts of the range,—and\r\nlastly, the smooth conical piles of fine and brightly coloured\r\ndetritus, which sloped up at a high angle from the base of the\r\nmountains, sometimes to a height of more than 2000 feet.\r\n\r\nI frequently observed, both in Tierra del Fuego and within the Andes,\r\nthat where the rock was covered during the greater part of the year\r\nwith snow, it was shivered in a very extraordinary manner into small\r\nangular fragments. Scoresby[1] has\r\nobserved the same fact in Spitzbergen. The case appears to me rather\r\nobscure: for that part of the mountain which is protected by a mantle\r\nof snow must be less subject to repeated and great changes of\r\ntemperature than any other part. I have sometimes thought that the\r\nearth and fragments of stone on the surface were perhaps less\r\neffectually removed by slowly percolating snow-water[2] than by rain,\r\nand therefore that the appearance of a quicker disintegration of the\r\nsolid rock under the snow was deceptive. Whatever the cause may be, the\r\nquantity of crumbling stone on the Cordillera is very great.\r\nOccasionally in the spring great masses of this detritus slide down the\r\nmountains, and cover the snow-drifts in the valleys, thus forming\r\nnatural ice-houses. We rode over one, the height of which was far below\r\nthe limit of perpetual snow.\r\n\r\n [1] Scoresby’s _Arctic Regions_, vol. i, p. 122.\r\n\r\n\r\n [2] I have heard it remarked in Shropshire that the water, when the\r\n Severn is flooded from long-continued rain, is much more turbid than\r\n when it proceeds from the snow melting on the Welsh mountains.\r\n D’Orbigny (tome i, 1 p. 184), in explaining the cause of the various\r\n colours of the rivers in South America, remarks that those with blue\r\n or clear water have their source in the Cordillera, where the snow\r\n melts.\r\n\r\nAs the evening drew to a close, we reached a singular basin-like plain,\r\ncalled the Valle del Yeso. It was covered by a little dry pasture, and\r\nwe had the pleasant sight of a herd of cattle amidst the surrounding\r\nrocky deserts. The valley takes its name of Yeso from a great bed, I\r\nshould think at least 2000 feet thick, of white, and in some parts\r\nquite pure, gypsum. We slept with a party of men, who were employed in\r\nloading mules with this substance, which is used in the manufacture of\r\nwine. We set out early in the morning (21st), and continued to follow\r\nthe course of the river, which had become very small, till we arrived\r\nat the foot of the ridge that separates the waters flowing into the\r\nPacific and Atlantic Oceans. The road, which as yet had been good with\r\na steady but very gradual ascent, now changed into a steep zigzag track\r\nup the great range dividing the republics of Chile and Mendoza.\r\n\r\nI will here give a very brief sketch of the geology of the several\r\nparallel lines forming the Cordillera. Of these lines, there are two\r\nconsiderably higher than the others; namely, on the Chilian side, the\r\nPeuquenes ridge, which, where the road crosses it, is 13,210 feet above\r\nthe sea; and the Portillo ridge, on the Mendoza side, which is 14,305\r\nfeet. The lower beds\r\nof the Peuquenes ridge, and of the several great lines to the westward\r\nof it, are composed of a vast pile, many thousand feet in thickness, of\r\nporphyries which have flowed as submarine lavas, alternating with\r\nangular and rounded fragments of the same rocks, thrown out of the\r\nsubmarine craters. These alternating masses are covered in the central\r\nparts by a great thickness of red sandstone, conglomerate, and\r\ncalcareous clay-slate, associated with, and passing into, prodigious\r\nbeds of gypsum. In these upper beds shells are tolerably frequent; and\r\nthey belong to about the period of the lower chalk of Europe. It is an\r\nold story, but not the less wonderful, to hear of shells which were\r\nonce crawling on the bottom of the sea, now standing nearly 14,000 feet\r\nabove its level. The lower beds in this great pile of strata have been\r\ndislocated, baked, crystallised and almost blended together, through\r\nthe agency of mountain masses of a peculiar white soda-granitic rock.\r\n\r\nThe other main line, namely, that of the Portillo, is of a totally\r\ndifferent formation: it consists chiefly of grand bare pinnacles of a\r\nred potash-granite, which low down on the western flank are covered by\r\na sandstone, converted by the former heat into a quartz-rock. On the\r\nquartz there rest beds of a conglomerate several thousand feet in\r\nthickness, which have been upheaved by the red granite, and dip at an\r\nangle of 45° towards the Peuquenes line. I was astonished to find that\r\nthis conglomerate was partly composed of pebbles, derived from the\r\nrocks, with their fossil shells, of the Peuquenes range; and partly of\r\nred potash-granite, like that of the Portillo. Hence we must conclude\r\nthat both the Peuquenes and Portillo ranges were partially upheaved and\r\nexposed to wear and tear when the conglomerate was forming; but as the\r\nbeds of the conglomerate have been thrown off at an angle of 45° by the\r\nred Portillo granite (with the underlying sandstone baked by it), we\r\nmay feel sure that the greater part of the injection and upheaval of\r\nthe already partially formed Portillo line took place after the\r\naccumulation of the conglomerate, and long after the elevation of the\r\nPeuquenes ridge. So that the Portillo, the loftiest line in this part\r\nof the Cordillera, is not so old as the less lofty line of the\r\nPeuquenes. Evidence derived from an inclined stream of lava at the\r\neastern base of the Portillo might be adduced to show that it owes part\r\nof\r\nits great height to elevations of a still later date. Looking to its\r\nearliest origin, the red granite seems to have been injected on an\r\nancient pre-existing line of white granite and mica-slate. In most\r\nparts, perhaps in all parts, of the Cordillera, it may be concluded\r\nthat each line has been formed by repeated upheavals and injections;\r\nand that the several parallel lines are of different ages. Only thus\r\ncan we gain time at all sufficient to explain the truly astonishing\r\namount of denudation which these great, though comparatively with most\r\nother ranges recent, mountains have suffered.\r\n\r\nFinally, the shells in the Peuquenes or oldest ridge prove, as before\r\nremarked, that it has been upraised 14,000 feet since a Secondary\r\nperiod, which in Europe we are accustomed to consider as far from\r\nancient; but since these shells lived in a moderately deep sea, it can\r\nbe shown that the area now occupied by the Cordillera must have\r\nsubsided several thousand feet—in northern Chile as much as 6000\r\nfeet—so as to have allowed that amount of submarine strata to have been\r\nheaped on the bed on which the shells lived. The proof is the same with\r\nthat by which it was shown that, at a much later period since the\r\ntertiary shells of Patagonia lived, there must have been there a\r\nsubsidence of several hundred feet, as well as an ensuing elevation.\r\nDaily it is forced home on the mind of the geologist that nothing, not\r\neven the wind that blows, is so unstable as the level of the crust of\r\nthis earth.\r\n\r\nI will make only one other geological remark: although the Portillo\r\nchain is here higher than the Peuquenes, the waters, draining the\r\nintermediate valleys, have burst through it. The same fact, on a\r\ngrander scale, has been remarked in the eastern and loftiest line of\r\nthe Bolivian Cordillera, through which the rivers pass: analogous facts\r\nhave also been observed in other quarters of the world. On the\r\nsupposition of the subsequent and gradual elevation of the Portillo\r\nline, this can be understood; for a chain of islets would at first\r\nappear, and, as these were lifted up, the tides would be always wearing\r\ndeeper and broader channels between them. At the present day, even in\r\nthe most retired Sounds on the coast of Tierra del Fuego, the currents\r\nin the transverse breaks which connect the longitudinal channels are\r\nvery strong, so that in one transverse channel even a small vessel\r\nunder sail was whirled round and round.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout noon we began the tedious ascent of the Peuquenes ridge, and then\r\nfor the first time experienced some little difficulty in our\r\nrespiration. The mules would halt every fifty yards, and after resting\r\nfor a few seconds the poor willing animals started of their own accord\r\nagain. The short breathing from the rarefied atmosphere is called by\r\nthe Chilenos “puna;” and they have most ridiculous notions concerning\r\nits origin. Some say “All the waters here have puna;” others that\r\n“where there is snow there is puna;”—and this no doubt is true. The\r\nonly sensation I experienced was a slight tightness across the head and\r\nchest, like that felt on leaving a warm room and running quickly in\r\nfrosty weather. There was some imagination even in this; for upon\r\nfinding fossil shells on the highest ridge, I entirely forgot the puna\r\nin my delight. Certainly the exertion of walking was extremely great,\r\nand the respiration became deep and laborious: I am told that in Potosi\r\n(about 13,000 feet above the sea) strangers do not become thoroughly\r\naccustomed to the atmosphere for an entire year. The inhabitants all\r\nrecommend onions for the puna; as this vegetable has sometimes been\r\ngiven in Europe for pectoral complaints, it may possibly be of real\r\nservice:—for my part I found nothing so good as the fossil shells!\r\n\r\nWhen about half-way up we met a large party with seventy loaded mules.\r\nIt was interesting to hear the wild cries of the muleteers, and to\r\nwatch the long descending string of the animals; they appeared so\r\ndiminutive, there being nothing but the black mountains with which they\r\ncould be compared. When near the summit, the wind, as generally\r\nhappens, was impetuous and extremely cold. On each side of the ridge we\r\nhad to pass over broad bands of perpetual snow, which were now soon to\r\nbe covered by a fresh layer. When we reached the crest and looked\r\nbackwards, a glorious view was presented. The atmosphere resplendently\r\nclear; the sky an intense blue; the profound valleys; the wild broken\r\nforms: the heaps of ruins, piled up during the lapse of ages; the\r\nbright-coloured rocks, contrasted with the quiet mountains of snow, all\r\nthese together produced a scene no one could have imagined. Neither\r\nplant nor bird, excepting a few condors wheeling around the higher\r\npinnacles, distracted my attention from the inanimate mass. I felt glad\r\nthat I was alone: it was like\r\nwatching a thunderstorm, or hearing in full orchestra a chorus of the\r\n_Messiah._\r\n\r\nOn several patches of the snow I found the Protococcus nivalis, or red\r\nsnow, so well known from the accounts of Arctic navigators. My\r\nattention was called to it by observing the footsteps of the mules\r\nstained a pale red, as if their hoofs had been slightly bloody. I at\r\nfirst thought that it was owing to dust blown from the surrounding\r\nmountains of red porphyry; for from the magnifying power of the\r\ncrystals of snow, the groups of these microscopical plants appeared\r\nlike coarse particles. The snow was coloured only where it had thawed\r\nvery rapidly, or had been accidentally crushed. A little rubbed on\r\npaper gave it a faint rose tinge mingled with a little brick-red. I\r\nafterwards scraped some off the paper, and found that it consisted of\r\ngroups of little spheres in colourless cases, each the thousandth part\r\nof an inch in diameter.\r\n\r\nThe wind on the crest of the Peuquenes, as just remarked, is generally\r\nimpetuous and very cold: it is said[3] to blow steadily from the\r\nwestward or Pacific side. As the observations have been chiefly made in\r\nsummer, this wind must be an upper and return current. The Peak of\r\nTeneriffe, with a less elevation, and situated in lat. 28°, in like\r\nmanner falls within an upper return stream. At first it appears rather\r\nsurprising that the trade-wind along the northern parts of Chile and on\r\nthe coast of Peru should blow in so very southerly a direction as it\r\ndoes; but when we reflect that the Cordillera, running in a north and\r\nsouth line, intercepts, like a great wall, the entire depth of the\r\nlower atmospheric current, we can easily see that the trade-wind must\r\nbe drawn northward, following the line of mountains, towards the\r\nequatorial regions, and thus lose part of that easterly movement which\r\nit otherwise would have gained from the earth’s rotation. At Mendoza,\r\non the eastern foot of the Andes, the climate is said to be subject to\r\nlong calms, and to frequent though false appearances of gathering\r\nrain-storms: we may imagine that the wind, which coming from the\r\neastward is thus banked up by the line of mountains, would become\r\nstagnant and irregular in its movements.\r\n\r\n [3] Dr. Gillies in _Journ. of Nat. and Geograph. Science_, Aug. 1830.\r\n This author gives the heights of the Passes.\r\n\r\nHaving crossed the Peuquenes, we descended into a\r\nmountainous country, intermediate between the two main ranges, and then\r\ntook up our quarters for the night. We were now in the republic of\r\nMendoza. The elevation was probably not under 11,000 feet, and the\r\nvegetation in consequence exceedingly scanty. The root of a small\r\nscrubby plant served as fuel, but it made a miserable fire, and the\r\nwind was piercingly cold. Being quite tired with my days work, I made\r\nup my bed as quickly as I could, and went to sleep. About midnight I\r\nobserved the sky became suddenly clouded: I awakened the arriero to\r\nknow if there was any danger of bad weather; but he said that without\r\nthunder and lightning there was no risk of a heavy snow-storm. The\r\nperil is imminent, and the difficulty of subsequent escape great, to\r\nany one overtaken by bad weather between the two ranges. A certain cave\r\noffers the only place of refuge: Mr. Caldcleugh, who crossed on this\r\nsame day of the month, was detained there for some time by a heavy fall\r\nof snow. Casuchas, or houses of refuge, have not been built in this\r\npass as in that of Uspallata, and therefore, during the autumn, the\r\nPortillo is little frequented. I may here remark that within the main\r\nCordillera rain never falls, for during the summer the sky is\r\ncloudless, and in winter snow-storms alone occur.\r\n\r\nAt the place where we slept water necessarily boiled, from the\r\ndiminished pressure of the atmosphere, at a lower temperature than it\r\ndoes in a less lofty country; the case being the converse of that of a\r\nPapin’s digester. Hence the potatoes, after remaining for some hours in\r\nthe boiling water, were nearly as hard as ever. The pot was left on the\r\nfire all night, and next morning it was boiled again, but yet the\r\npotatoes were not cooked. I found out this by overhearing my two\r\ncompanions discussing the cause, they had come to the simple conclusion\r\n“that the cursed pot (which was a new one) did not choose to boil\r\npotatoes.”\r\n\r\n_March_ 22_nd._—After eating our potato-less breakfast, we travelled\r\nacross the intermediate tract to the foot of the Portillo range. In the\r\nmiddle of summer cattle are brought up here to graze; but they had now\r\nall been removed: even the greater number of the guanacos had decamped,\r\nknowing well that if overtaken here by a snow-storm, they would be\r\ncaught in a trap. We had a fine view of a mass of mountains called\r\nTupungato, the whole clothed with unbroken snow, in the midst of which\r\nthere was a blue patch, no doubt a glacier;—a circumstance of rare\r\noccurrence in these mountains. Now commenced a heavy and long climb,\r\nsimilar to that of the Peuquenes. Bold conical hills of red granite\r\nrose on each hand; in the valleys there were several broad fields of\r\nperpetual snow. These frozen masses, during the process of thawing, had\r\nin some parts been converted into pinnacles or columns,[4] which, as\r\nthey were high and close together, made it difficult for the cargo\r\nmules to pass. On one of these columns of ice a frozen horse was\r\nsticking as on a pedestal, but with its hind legs straight up in the\r\nair. The animal, I suppose, must have fallen with its head downward\r\ninto a hole, when the snow was continuous, and afterwards the\r\nsurrounding parts must have been removed by the thaw.\r\n\r\n [4] This structure in frozen snow was long since observed by Scoresby\r\n in the icebergs near Spitzbergen, and, lately, with more care, by\r\n Colonel Jackson (_Journ. of Geograph. Soc._ vol. v, p. 12) on the\r\n Neva. Mr. Lyell (_Principles_, vol. iv, p. 360 has compared the\r\n fissures, by which the columnar structure seems to be determined, to\r\n the joints that traverse nearly all rocks, but which are best seen in\r\n the non-stratified masses. I may observe that in the case of the\r\n frozen snow the columnar structure must be owing to a “metamorphic”\r\n action, and not to a process during _deposition._\r\n\r\nWhen nearly on the crest of the Portillo, we were enveloped in a\r\nfalling cloud of minute frozen spicula. This was very unfortunate, as\r\nit continued the whole day, and quite intercepted our view. The pass\r\ntakes its name of Portillo from a narrow cleft or doorway on the\r\nhighest ridge, through which the road passes. From this point, on a\r\nclear day, those vast plains which uninterruptedly extend to the\r\nAtlantic Ocean can be seen. We descended to the upper limit of\r\nvegetation, and found good quarters for the night under the shelter of\r\nsome large fragments of rock. We met here some passengers, who made\r\nanxious inquiries about the state of the road. Shortly after it was\r\ndark the clouds suddenly cleared away, and the effect was quite\r\nmagical. The great mountains, bright with the full moon, seemed\r\nimpending over us on all sides, as over a deep crevice: one morning,\r\nvery early, I witnessed the same striking effect. As soon as the clouds\r\nwere dispersed it froze severely; but as there was no wind, we slept\r\nvery comfortably.\r\n\r\nThe increased brilliancy of the moon and stars at this elevation, owing\r\nto the perfect transparency of the atmosphere, was\r\nvery remarkable. Travellers having observed the difficulty of judging\r\nheights and distances amidst lofty mountains, have generally attributed\r\nit to the absence of objects of comparison. It appears to me, that it\r\nis fully as much owing to the transparency of the air confounding\r\nobjects at different distances, and likewise partly to the novelty of\r\nan unusual degree of fatigue arising from a little exertion,—habit\r\nbeing thus opposed to the evidence of the senses. I am sure that this\r\nextreme clearness of the air gives a peculiar character to the\r\nlandscape, all objects appearing to be brought nearly into one plane,\r\nas in a drawing or panorama. The transparency is, I presume, owing to\r\nthe equable and high state of atmospheric dryness. This dryness was\r\nshown by the manner in which woodwork shrank (as I soon found by the\r\ntrouble my geological hammer gave me); by articles of food, such as\r\nbread and sugar, becoming extremely hard; and by the preservation of\r\nthe skin and parts of the flesh of the beasts which had perished on the\r\nroad. To the same cause we must attribute the singular facility with\r\nwhich electricity is excited. My flannel-waistcoat, when rubbed in the\r\ndark, appeared as if it had been washed with phosphorus,—every hair on\r\na dog’s back crackled;—even the linen sheets, and leathern straps of\r\nthe saddle, when handled, emitted sparks.\r\n\r\n_March_ 23_rd._—The descent on the eastern side of the Cordillera is\r\nmuch shorter or steeper than on the Pacific side; in other words, the\r\nmountains rise more abruptly from the plains than from the alpine\r\ncountry of Chile. A level and brilliantly white sea of clouds was\r\nstretched out beneath our feet, shutting out the view of the equally\r\nlevel Pampas. We soon entered the band of clouds, and did not again\r\nemerge from it that day. About noon, finding pasture for the animals\r\nand bushes for firewood at Los Arenales, we stopped for the night. This\r\nwas near the uppermost limit of bushes, and the elevation, I suppose,\r\nwas between seven and eight thousand feet.\r\n\r\nI was much struck with the marked difference between the vegetation of\r\nthese eastern valleys and those on the Chilian side: yet the climate,\r\nas well as the kind of soil, is nearly the same, and the difference of\r\nlongitude very trifling. The same remark holds good with the\r\nquadrupeds, and in a lesser degree with the birds and insects. I may\r\ninstance the mice, of which\r\nI obtained thirteen species on the shores of the Atlantic, and five on\r\nthe Pacific, and not one of them is identical. We must except all those\r\nspecies which habitually or occasionally frequent elevated mountains;\r\nand certain birds, which range as far south as the Strait of Magellan.\r\nThis fact is in perfect accordance with the geological history of the\r\nAndes; for these mountains have existed as a great barrier since the\r\npresent races of animals have appeared; and therefore, unless we\r\nsuppose the same species to have been created in two different places,\r\nwe ought not to expect any closer similarity between the organic beings\r\non the opposite sides of the Andes than on the opposite shores of the\r\nocean. In both cases, we must leave out of the question those kinds\r\nwhich have been able to cross the barrier, whether of solid rock or\r\nsalt water.[5]\r\n\r\n [5] This is merely an illustration of the admirable laws, first laid\r\n down by Mr. Lyell, on the geographical distribution of animals, as\r\n influenced by geological changes. The whole reasoning, of course, is\r\n founded on the assumption of the immutability of species; otherwise\r\n the difference in the species in the two regions might be considered\r\n as superinduced during a length of time.\r\n\r\nA great number of the plants and animals were absolutely the same as,\r\nor most closely allied to, those of Patagonia. We here have the agouti,\r\nbizcacha, three species of armadillo, the ostrich, certain kinds of\r\npartridges and other birds, none of which are ever seen in Chile, but\r\nare the characteristic animals of the desert plains of Patagonia. We\r\nhave likewise many of the same (to the eyes of a person who is not a\r\nbotanist) thorny stunted bushes, withered grass, and dwarf plants. Even\r\nthe black slowly crawling beetles are closely similar, and some, I\r\nbelieve, on rigorous examination, absolutely identical. It had always\r\nbeen to me a subject of regret that we were unavoidably compelled to\r\ngive up the ascent of the S. Cruz river before reaching the mountains:\r\nI always had a latent hope of meeting with some great change in the\r\nfeatures of the country; but I now feel sure that it would only have\r\nbeen following the plains of Patagonia up a mountainous ascent.\r\n\r\n_March_ 24_th._—Early in the morning I climbed up a mountain on one\r\nside of the valley, and enjoyed a far extended view over the Pampas.\r\nThis was a spectacle to which I had always looked forward with\r\ninterest, but I was disappointed: at the first glance it much resembled\r\na distant view of the ocean, but in the northern parts many\r\nirregularities were soon\r\ndistinguishable. The most striking feature consisted in the rivers,\r\nwhich, facing the rising sun, glittered like silver threads, till lost\r\nin the immensity of the distance. At mid-day we descended the valley,\r\nand reached a hovel, where an officer and three soldiers were posted to\r\nexamine passports. One of these men was a thoroughbred Pampas Indian:\r\nhe was kept much for the same purpose as a bloodhound, to track out any\r\nperson who might pass by secretly, either on foot or horseback. Some\r\nyears ago a passenger endeavoured to escape detection by making a long\r\ncircuit over a neighbouring mountain; but this Indian, having by chance\r\ncrossed his track, followed it for the whole day over dry and very\r\nstony hills, till at last he came on his prey hidden in a gully. We\r\nhere heard that the silvery clouds, which we had admired from the\r\nbright region above, had poured down torrents of rain. The valley from\r\nthis point gradually opened, and the hills became mere water-worn\r\nhillocks compared to the giants behind; it then expanded into a gently\r\nsloping plain of shingle, covered with low trees and bushes. This\r\ntalus, although appearing narrow, must be nearly ten miles wide before\r\nit blends into the apparently dead level Pampas. We passed the only\r\nhouse in this neighbourhood, the Estancia of Chaquaio: and at sunset we\r\npulled up in the first snug corner, and there bivouacked.\r\n\r\n_March_ 25_th._—I was reminded of the Pampas of Buenos Ayres, by seeing\r\nthe disk of the rising sun intersected by an horizon level as that of\r\nthe ocean. During the night a heavy dew fell, a circumstance which we\r\ndid not experience within the Cordillera. The road proceeded for some\r\ndistance due east across a low swamp; then meeting the dry plain, it\r\nturned to the north towards Mendoza. The distance is two very long\r\ndays’ journey. Our first day’s journey was called fourteen leagues to\r\nEstacado, and the second seventeen to Luxan, near Mendoza. The whole\r\ndistance is over a level desert plain, with not more than two or three\r\nhouses. The sun was exceedingly powerful, and the ride devoid of all\r\ninterest. There is very little water in this “traversia,” and in our\r\nsecond day’s journey we found only one little pool. Little water flows\r\nfrom the mountains, and it soon becomes absorbed by the dry and porous\r\nsoil; so that, although we travelled at the distance of only ten or\r\nfifteen miles from the\r\nouter range of the Cordillera, we did not cross a single stream. In\r\nmany parts the ground was incrusted with a saline efflorescence; hence\r\nwe had the same salt-loving plants which are common near Bahia Blanca.\r\nThe landscape has a uniform character from the Strait of Magellan,\r\nalong the whole eastern coast of Patagonia, to the Rio Colorado; and it\r\nappears that the same kind of country extends inland from this river,\r\nin a sweeping line as far as San Luis, and perhaps even farther north.\r\nTo the eastward of this curved line lies the basin of the comparatively\r\ndamp and green plains of Buenos Ayres. The sterile plains of Mendoza\r\nand Patagonia consist of a bed of shingle, worn smooth and accumulated\r\nby the waves of the sea; while the Pampas, covered by thistles, clover,\r\nand grass, have been formed by the ancient estuary mud of the Plata.\r\n\r\nAfter our two days’ tedious journey, it was refreshing to see in the\r\ndistance the rows of poplars and willows growing round the village and\r\nriver of Luxan. Shortly before we arrived at this place we observed to\r\nthe south a ragged cloud of a dark reddish-brown colour. At first we\r\nthought that it was smoke from some great fire on the plains; but we\r\nsoon found that it was a swarm of locusts. They were flying northward;\r\nand with the aid of a light breeze, they overtook us at a rate of ten\r\nor fifteen miles an hour. The main body filled the air from a height of\r\ntwenty feet to that, as it appeared, of two or three thousand above the\r\nground; “and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of\r\nmany horses running to battle:” or rather, I should say, like a strong\r\nbreeze passing through the rigging of a ship. The sky, seen through the\r\nadvanced guard, appeared like a mezzotinto engraving, but the main body\r\nwas impervious to sight; they were not, however, so thick together, but\r\nthat they could escape a stick waved backwards and forwards. When they\r\nalighted, they were more numerous than the leaves in the field, and the\r\nsurface became reddish instead of being green: the swarm having once\r\nalighted, the individuals flew from side to side in all directions.\r\nLocusts are not an uncommon pest in this country: already during this\r\nseason several smaller swarms had come up from the south, where, as\r\napparently in all other parts of the world, they are bred in the\r\ndeserts. The poor cottagers in vain attempted by lighting fires, by\r\nshouts, and by waving branches, to avert the attack. This\r\nspecies of locust closely resembles, and perhaps is identical with, the\r\nfamous Gryllus migratorius of the East.\r\n\r\nWe crossed the Luxan, which is a river of considerable size, though its\r\ncourse towards the sea-coast is very imperfectly known: it is even\r\ndoubtful whether, in passing over the plains, it is not evaporated and\r\nlost. We slept in the village of Luxan, which is a small place\r\nsurrounded by gardens, and forms the most southern cultivated district\r\nin the Province of Mendoza; it is five leagues south of the capital. At\r\nnight I experienced an attack (for it deserves no less a name) of the\r\n_Benchuca_, a species of Reduvius, the great black bug of the Pampas.\r\nIt is most disgusting to feel soft wingless insects, about an inch\r\nlong, crawling over one’s body. Before sucking they are quite thin, but\r\nafterwards they become round and bloated with blood, and in this state\r\nare easily crushed. One which I caught at Iquique (for they are found\r\nin Chile and Peru) was very empty. When placed on a table, and though\r\nsurrounded by people, if a finger was presented, the bold insect would\r\nimmediately protrude its sucker, make a charge, and if allowed, draw\r\nblood. No pain was caused by the wound. It was curious to watch its\r\nbody during the act of sucking, as in less than ten minutes it changed\r\nfrom being as flat as a wafer to a globular form. This one feast, for\r\nwhich the benchuca was indebted to one of the officers, kept it fat\r\nduring four whole months; but, after the first fortnight, it was quite\r\nready to have another suck.\r\n\r\n_March_ 27_th._—We rode on to Mendoza. The country was beautifully\r\ncultivated, and resembled Chile. This neighbourhood is celebrated for\r\nits fruit; and certainly nothing could appear more flourishing than the\r\nvineyards and the orchards of figs, peaches, and olives. We bought\r\nwater-melons nearly twice as large as a man’s head, most deliciously\r\ncool and well-flavoured, for a halfpenny apiece; and for the value of\r\nthreepence, half a wheelbarrowful of peaches. The cultivated and\r\nenclosed part of this province is very small; there is little more than\r\nthat which we passed through between Luxan and the Capital. The land,\r\nas in Chile, owes its fertility entirely to artificial irrigation; and\r\nit is really wonderful to observe how extraordinarily productive a\r\nbarren traversia is thus rendered.\r\n\r\nWe stayed the ensuing day in Mendoza. The prosperity of the place has\r\nmuch declined of late years. The inhabitants\r\nsay “it is good to live in, but very bad to grow rich in.” The lower\r\norders have the lounging, reckless manners of the Gauchos of the\r\nPampas; and their dress, riding-gear, and habits of life, are nearly\r\nthe same. To my mind the town had a stupid, forlorn aspect. Neither the\r\nboasted alameda, nor the scenery, is at all comparable with that of\r\nSantiago; but to those who, coming from Buenos Ayres, have just crossed\r\nthe unvaried Pampas, the gardens and orchards must appear delightful.\r\nSir F. Head, speaking of the inhabitants, says, “They eat their\r\ndinners, and it is so very hot, they go to sleep—and could they do\r\nbetter?” I quite agree with Sir F. Head: the happy doom of the\r\nMendozinos is to eat, sleep and be idle.\r\n\r\n\r\n_March_ 29_th._—We set out on our return to Chile by the Uspallata pass\r\nsituated north of Mendoza. We had to cross a long and most sterile\r\ntraversia of fifteen leagues. The soil in parts was absolutely bare, in\r\nothers covered by numberless dwarf cacti, armed with formidable spines,\r\nand called by the inhabitants “little lions.” There were, also, a few\r\nlow bushes. Although the plain is nearly three thousand feet above the\r\nsea, the sun was very powerful; and the heat, as well as the clouds of\r\nimpalpable dust, rendered the travelling extremely irksome. Our course\r\nduring the day lay nearly parallel to the Cordillera, but gradually\r\napproaching them. Before sunset we entered one of the wide valleys, or\r\nrather bays, which open on the plain: this soon narrowed into a ravine,\r\nwhere a little higher up the house of Villa Vicencio is situated. As we\r\nhad ridden all day without a drop of water, both our mules and selves\r\nwere very thirsty, and we looked out anxiously for the stream which\r\nflows down this valley. It was curious to observe how gradually the\r\nwater made its appearance: on the plain the course was quite dry; by\r\ndegrees it became a little damper; then puddles of water appeared;\r\nthese soon became connected; and at Villa Vicencio there was a nice\r\nlittle rivulet.\r\n\r\n30_th._—The solitary hovel which bears the imposing name of Villa\r\nVicencio has been mentioned by every traveller who has crossed the\r\nAndes. I stayed here and at some neighbouring mines during the two\r\nsucceeding days. The geology of the surrounding country is very\r\ncurious. The Uspallata range is separated from the main Cordillera by a\r\nlong narrow plain or\r\nbasin, like those so often mentioned in Chile, but higher, being six\r\nthousand feet above the sea. This range has nearly the same\r\ngeographical position with respect to the Cordillera, which the\r\ngigantic Portillo line has, but it is of a totally different origin: it\r\nconsists of various kinds of submarine lava, alternating with volcanic\r\nsandstones and other remarkable sedimentary deposits; the whole having\r\na very close resemblance to some of the tertiary beds on the shores of\r\nthe Pacific. From this resemblance I expected to find silicified wood,\r\nwhich is generally characteristic of those formations. I was gratified\r\nin a very extraordinary manner. In the central part of the range, at an\r\nelevation of about seven thousand feet, I observed on a bare slope some\r\nsnow-white projecting columns. These were petrified trees, eleven being\r\nsilicified, and from thirty to forty converted into\r\ncoarsely-crystallised white calcareous spar. They were abruptly broken\r\noff, the upright stumps projecting a few feet above the ground. The\r\ntrunks measured from three to five feet each in circumference. They\r\nstood a little way apart from each other, but the whole formed one\r\ngroup. Mr. Robert Brown has been kind enough to examine the wood: he\r\nsays it belongs to the fir tribe, partaking of the character of the\r\nAraucarian family, but with some curious points of affinity with the\r\nyew. The volcanic sandstone in which the trees were embedded, and from\r\nthe lower part of which they must have sprung, had accumulated in\r\nsuccessive thin layers around their trunks; and the stone yet retained\r\nthe impression of the bark.\r\n\r\nIt required little geological practice to interpret the marvellous\r\nstory which this scene at once unfolded; though I confess I was at\r\nfirst so much astonished that I could scarcely believe the plainest\r\nevidence. I saw the spot where a cluster of fine trees once waved their\r\nbranches on the shores of the Atlantic, when that ocean (now driven\r\nback 700 miles) came to the foot of the Andes. I saw that they had\r\nsprung from a volcanic soil which had been raised above the level of\r\nthe sea, and that subsequently this dry land, with its upright trees,\r\nhad been let down into the depths of the ocean. In these depths, the\r\nformerly dry land was covered by sedimentary beds, and these again by\r\nenormous streams of submarine lava—one such mass attaining the\r\nthickness of a thousand feet; and these deluges of molten stone and\r\naqueous deposits five times alternately had\r\nbeen spread out. The ocean which received such thick masses must have\r\nbeen profoundly deep; but again the subterranean forces exerted\r\nthemselves, and I now beheld the bed of that ocean, forming a chain of\r\nmountains more than seven thousand feet in height. Nor had those\r\nantagonistic forces been dormant, which are always at work wearing down\r\nthe surface of the land; the great piles of strata had been intersected\r\nby many wide valleys, and the trees, now changed into silex, were\r\nexposed projecting from the volcanic soil, now changed into rock,\r\nwhence formerly, in a green and budding state, they had raised their\r\nlofty heads. Now, all is utterly irreclaimable and desert; even the\r\nlichen cannot adhere to the stony casts of former trees. Vast, and\r\nscarcely comprehensible as such changes must ever appear, yet they have\r\nall occurred within a period, recent when compared with the history of\r\nthe Cordillera; and the Cordillera itself is absolutely modern as\r\ncompared with many of the fossiliferous strata of Europe and America.\r\n\r\n_April_ 1_st._—We crossed the Uspallata range, and at night slept at\r\nthe custom-house—the only inhabited spot on the plain. Shortly before\r\nleaving the mountains, there was a very extraordinary view; red,\r\npurple, green, and quite white sedimentary rocks, alternating with\r\nblack lavas, were broken up and thrown into all kinds of disorder by\r\nmasses of porphyry of every shade of colour, from dark brown to the\r\nbrightest lilac. It was the first view I ever saw, which really\r\nresembled those pretty sections which geologists make of the inside of\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\nThe next day we crossed the plain, and followed the course of the same\r\ngreat mountain stream which flows by Luxan. Here it was a furious\r\ntorrent, quite impassable, and appeared larger than in the low country,\r\nas was the case with the rivulet of Villa Vicencio. On the evening of\r\nthe succeeding day we reached the Rio de las Vacas, which is considered\r\nthe worst stream in the Cordillera to cross. As all these rivers have a\r\nrapid and short course, and are formed by the melting of the snow, the\r\nhour of the day makes a considerable difference in their volume. In the\r\nevening the stream is muddy and full, but about daybreak it becomes\r\nclearer and much less impetuous. This we found to be the case with the\r\nRio Vacas, and in the morning we crossed it with little difficulty.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe scenery thus far was very uninteresting, compared with that of the\r\nPortillo pass. Little can be seen beyond the bare walls of the one\r\ngrand, flat-bottomed valley, which the road follows up to the highest\r\ncrest. The valley and the huge rocky mountains are extremely barren:\r\nduring the two previous nights the poor mules had absolutely nothing to\r\neat, for excepting a few low resinous bushes, scarcely a plant can be\r\nseen. In the course of this day we crossed some of the worst passes in\r\nthe Cordillera, but their danger has been much exaggerated. I was told\r\nthat if I attempted to pass on foot, my head would turn giddy, and that\r\nthere was no room to dismount; but I did not see a place where any one\r\nmight not have walked over backwards, or got off his mule on either\r\nside. One of the bad passes, called _las Animas_ (the Souls), I had\r\ncrossed, and did not find out till a day afterwards that it was one of\r\nthe awful dangers. No doubt there are many parts in which, if the mule\r\nshould stumble, the rider would be hurled down a great precipice; but\r\nof this there is little chance. I daresay, in the spring, the\r\n“laderas,” or roads, which each year are formed anew across the piles\r\nof fallen detritus, are very bad; but from what I saw, I suspect the\r\nreal danger is nothing. With cargo-mules the case is rather different,\r\nfor the loads project so far, that the animals, occasionally running\r\nagainst each other, or against a point of rock, lose their balance, and\r\nare thrown down the precipices. In crossing the rivers I can well\r\nbelieve that the difficulty may be very great: at this season there was\r\nlittle trouble, but in the summer they must be very hazardous. I can\r\nquite imagine, as Sir F. Head describes, the different expressions of\r\nthose who _have_ passed the gulf, and those who _are_ passing. I never\r\nheard of any man being drowned, but with loaded mules it frequently\r\nhappens. The arriero tells you to show your mule the best line, and\r\nthen allow her to cross as she likes: the cargo-mule takes a bad line,\r\nand is often lost.\r\n\r\n_April_ 4_th._—From the Rio de las Vacas to the Puente del Incas, half\r\na day’s journey. As there was pasture for the mules, and geology for\r\nme, we bivouacked here for the night. When one hears of a natural\r\nBridge, one pictures to oneself some deep and narrow ravine, across\r\nwhich a bold mass of rock has fallen; or a great arch hollowed out like\r\nthe vault of a cavern. Instead of this, the Incas Bridge consists of a\r\ncrust of stratified shingle\r\ncemented together by the deposits of the neighbouring hot springs. It\r\nappears as if the stream had scooped out a channel on one side, leaving\r\nan overhanging ledge, which was met by earth and stones falling down\r\nfrom the opposite cliff. Certainly an oblique junction, as would happen\r\nin such a case, was very distinct on one side. The Bridge of the Incas\r\nis by no means worthy of the great monarchs whose name it bears.\r\n\r\nBridge of the Incas—Uspallata Pass\r\n\r\n5_th._—We had a long day’s ride across the central ridge, from the\r\nIncas Bridge to the Ojos del Agua, which are situated near the lowest\r\n_casucha_ on the Chilian side. These casuchas\r\nare round little towers, with steps outside to reach the floor, which\r\nis raised some feet above the ground on account of the snow-drifts.\r\nThey are eight in number, and under the Spanish government were kept\r\nduring the winter well stored with food and charcoal, and each courier\r\nhad a master-key. Now they only answer the purpose of caves, or rather\r\ndungeons. Seated on some little eminence, they are not, however, ill\r\nsuited to the surrounding scene of desolation. The zigzag ascent of the\r\nCumbre, or the partition of the waters, was very steep and tedious; its\r\nheight, according to Mr. Pentland, is 12,454 feet. The road did not\r\npass over any perpetual snow, although there were patches of it on both\r\nhands. The wind on the summit was exceedingly cold, but it was\r\nimpossible not to stop for a few minutes to admire, again and again,\r\nthe colour of the heavens, and the brilliant transparency of the\r\natmosphere. The scenery was grand: to the westward there was a fine\r\nchaos of mountains, divided by profound ravines. Some snow generally\r\nfalls before this period of the season, and it has even happened that\r\nthe Cordillera have been finally closed by this time. But we were most\r\nfortunate. The sky, by night and by day, was cloudless, excepting a few\r\nround little masses of vapour, that floated over the highest pinnacles.\r\nI have often seen these islets in the sky, marking the position of the\r\nCordillera, when the far-distant mountains have been hidden beneath the\r\nhorizon.\r\n\r\n_April_ 6_th._—In the morning we found some thief had stolen one of our\r\nmules, and the bell of the madrina. We therefore rode only two or three\r\nmiles down the valley, and stayed there the ensuing day in hopes of\r\nrecovering the mule, which the arriero thought had been hidden in some\r\nravine. The scenery in this part had assumed a Chilian character: the\r\nlower sides of the mountains, dotted over with the pale evergreen\r\nQuillay tree, and with the great chandelier-like cactus, are certainly\r\nmore to be admired than the bare eastern valleys; but I cannot quite\r\nagree with the admiration expressed by some travellers. The extreme\r\npleasure, I suspect, is chiefly owing to the prospect of a good fire\r\nand of a good supper, after escaping from the cold regions above: and I\r\nam sure I most heartily participated in these feelings.\r\n\r\n8_th._—We left the valley of the Aconcagua, by which we\r\nhad descended, and reached in the evening a cottage near the Villa de\r\nSt. Rosa. The fertility of the plain was delightful: the autumn being\r\nadvanced, the leaves of many of the fruit-trees were falling; and of\r\nthe labourers,—some were busy in drying figs and peaches on the roofs\r\nof their cottages, while others were gathering the grapes from the\r\nvineyards. It was a pretty scene; but I missed that pensive stillness\r\nwhich makes the autumn in England indeed the evening of the year. On\r\nthe 10th we reached Santiago, where I received a very kind and\r\nhospitable reception from Mr. Caldcleugh. My excursion only cost me\r\ntwenty-four days, and never did I more deeply enjoy an equal space of\r\ntime. A few days afterwards I returned to Mr. Corfield’s house at\r\nValparaiso.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lima and San Lorenzo]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVI\r\n\r\n\r\nCoast-road to Coquimbo—Great loads carried by the\r\nminers—Coquimbo—Earthquake—Step-formed terraces—Absence of recent\r\ndeposits—Contemporaneousness of the Tertiary formations—Excursion up\r\nthe valley—Road to Guasco—Deserts—Valley of Copiapó—Rain and\r\nEarthquakes—Hydrophobia—The Despoblado—Indian ruins—Probable change of\r\nclimate—River-bed arched by an earthquake—Cold gales of wind—Noises\r\nfrom a hill—Iquique—Salt alluvium—Nitrate of soda—Lima—Unhealthy\r\ncountry—Ruins of Callao, overthrown by an earthquake—Recent\r\nsubsidence—Elevated shells on San Lorenzo, their decomposition—Plain\r\nwith embedded shells and fragments of pottery—Antiquity of the Indian\r\nRace.\r\n\r\nNORTHERN CHILE AND PERU.\r\n\r\n_April_ 27_th._—I set out on a journey to Coquimbo, and thence through\r\nGuasco to Copiapó, where Captain Fitz Roy kindly offered to pick me up\r\nin the _Beagle._ The distance in a straight line along the shore\r\nnorthward is only 420 miles; but my mode of travelling made it a very\r\nlong journey. I bought\r\nfour horses and two mules, the latter carrying the luggage on alternate\r\ndays. The six animals together only cost the value of twenty-five\r\npounds sterling, and at Copiapó I sold them again for twenty-three. We\r\ntravelled in the same independent manner as before, cooking our own\r\nmeals, and sleeping in the open air. As we rode towards the Viño del\r\nMar, I took a farewell view of Valparaiso, and admired its picturesque\r\nappearance. For geological purposes I made a detour from the high road\r\nto the foot of the Bell of Quillota. We passed through an alluvial\r\ndistrict rich in gold, to the neighbourhood of Limache, where we slept.\r\nWashing for gold supports the inhabitants of numerous hovels, scattered\r\nalong the sides of each little rivulet; but, like all those whose gains\r\nare uncertain, they are unthrifty in their habits, and consequently\r\npoor.\r\n\r\n28_th._—In the afternoon we arrived at a cottage at the foot of the\r\nBell mountain. The inhabitants were freeholders, which is not very\r\nusual in Chile. They supported themselves on the produce of a garden\r\nand a little field, but were very poor. Capital is here so deficient\r\nthat the people are obliged to sell their green corn while standing in\r\nthe field, in order to buy necessaries for the ensuing year. Wheat in\r\nconsequence was dearer in the very district of its production than at\r\nValparaiso, where the contractors live. The next day we joined the main\r\nroad to Coquimbo. At night there was a very light shower of rain: this\r\nwas the first drop that had fallen since the heavy rain of September\r\n11th and 12th, which detained me a prisoner at the Baths of Cauquenes.\r\nThe interval was seven and a half months; but the rain this year in\r\nChile was rather later than usual. The distant Andes were now covered\r\nby a thick mass of snow, and were a glorious sight.\r\n\r\n_May_ 2_nd._—The road continued to follow the coast at no great\r\ndistance from the sea. The few trees and bushes which are common in\r\ncentral Chile decreased rapidly in numbers, and were replaced by a tall\r\nplant, something like a yucca in appearance. The surface of the\r\ncountry, on a small scale, was singularly broken and irregular; abrupt\r\nlittle peaks of rock rising out of small plains or basins. The indented\r\ncoast and the bottom of the neighbouring sea, studded with breakers,\r\nwould, if converted into dry land, present similar forms; and\r\nsuch a conversion without doubt has taken place in the part over which\r\nwe rode.\r\n\r\n3_rd._—Quilimari to Conchalee. The country became more and more barren.\r\nIn the valleys there was scarcely sufficient water for any irrigation;\r\nand the intermediate land was quite bare, not supporting even goats. In\r\nthe spring, after the winter showers, a thin pasture rapidly springs\r\nup, and cattle are then driven down from the Cordillera to graze for a\r\nshort time. It is curious to observe how the seeds of the grass and\r\nother plants seem to accommodate themselves, as if by an acquired\r\nhabit, to the quantity of rain which falls upon different parts of this\r\ncoast. One shower far northward at Copiapó produces as great an effect\r\non the vegetation, as two at Guasco, and three or four in this\r\ndistrict. At Valparaiso a winter so dry as greatly to injure the\r\npasture, would at Guasco produce the most unusual abundance. Proceeding\r\nnorthward, the quantity of rain does not appear to decrease in strict\r\nproportion to the latitude. At Conchalee, which is only 67 miles north\r\nof Valparaiso, rain is not expected till the end of May; whereas at\r\nValparaiso some generally falls early in April: the annual quantity is\r\nlikewise small in proportion to the lateness of the season at which it\r\ncommences.\r\n\r\n4_th._—Finding the coast-road devoid of interest of any kind, we turned\r\ninland towards the mining district and valley of Illapel. This valley,\r\nlike every other in Chile, is level, broad, and very fertile: it is\r\nbordered on each side, either by cliffs of stratified shingle, or by\r\nbare rocky mountains. Above the straight line of the uppermost\r\nirrigating ditch, all is brown as on a high-road; while all below is of\r\nas bright a green as verdigris, from the beds of alfarfa, a kind of\r\nclover. We proceeded to Los Hornos, another mining district, where the\r\nprincipal hill was drilled with holes, like a great ants’-nest. The\r\nChilian miners are a peculiar race of men in their habits. Living for\r\nweeks together in the most desolate spots, when they descend to the\r\nvillages on feast-days there is no excess of extravagance into which\r\nthey do not run. They sometimes gain a considerable sum, and then, like\r\nsailors with prize-money, they try how soon they can contrive to\r\nsquander it. They drink excessively, buy quantities of clothes, and in\r\na few days return penniless to their miserable abodes, there to work\r\nharder\r\nthan beasts of burden. This thoughtlessness, as with sailors, is\r\nevidently the result of a similar manner of life. Their daily food is\r\nfound them, and they acquire no habits of carefulness; moreover,\r\ntemptation and the means of yielding to it are placed in their power at\r\nthe same time. On the other hand, in Cornwall, and some other parts of\r\nEngland, where the system of selling part of the vein is followed, the\r\nminers, from being obliged to act and think for themselves, are a\r\nsingularly intelligent and well-conducted set of men.\r\n\r\nThe dress of the Chilian miner is peculiar and rather picturesque. He\r\nwears a very long shirt of some dark-coloured baize, with a leathern\r\napron; the whole being fastened round his waist by a bright-coloured\r\nsash. His trousers are very broad, and his small cap of scarlet cloth\r\nis made to fit the head closely. We met a party of these miners in full\r\ncostume, carrying the body of one of their companions to be buried.\r\nThey marched at a very quick trot, four men supporting the corpse. One\r\nset having run as hard as they could for about two hundred yards, were\r\nrelieved by four others, who had previously dashed on ahead on\r\nhorseback. Thus they proceeded, encouraging each other by wild cries:\r\naltogether the scene formed a most strange funeral.\r\n\r\nWe continued travelling northward in a zigzag line; sometimes stopping\r\na day to geologise. The country was so thinly inhabited, and the track\r\nso obscure, that we often had difficulty in finding our way. On the\r\n12th I stayed at some mines. The ore in this case was not considered\r\nparticularly good, but from being abundant it was supposed the mine\r\nwould sell for about thirty or forty thousand dollars (that is, 6000 or\r\n8000 pounds sterling); yet it had been bought by one of the English\r\nAssociations for an ounce of gold (£3 : 8s). The ore is yellow pyrites,\r\nwhich, as I have already remarked, before the arrival of the English\r\nwas not supposed to contain a particle of copper. On a scale of profits\r\nnearly as great as in the above instance, piles of cinders, abounding\r\nwith minute globules of metallic copper, were purchased; yet with these\r\nadvantages, the mining associations, as is well known, contrived to\r\nlose immense sums of money. The folly of the greater number of the\r\ncommissioners and shareholders amounted to infatuation;—a thousand\r\npounds per annum given in some\r\ncases to entertain the Chilian authorities; libraries of well-bound\r\ngeological books; miners brought out for particular metals, as tin,\r\nwhich are not found in Chile; contracts to supply the miners with milk,\r\nin parts where there are no cows; machinery, where it could not\r\npossibly be used; and a hundred similar arrangements, bore witness to\r\nour absurdity, and to this day afford amusement to the natives. Yet\r\nthere can be no doubt, that the same capital well employed in these\r\nmines would have yielded an immense return: a confidential man of\r\nbusiness, a practical miner and assayer, would have been all that was\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\nCaptain Head has described the wonderful load which the “Apires,” truly\r\nbeasts of burden, carry up from the deepest mines. I confess I thought\r\nthe account exaggerated; so that I was glad to take an opportunity of\r\nweighing one of the loads, which I picked out by hazard. It required\r\nconsiderable exertion on my part, when standing directly over it, to\r\nlift it from the ground. The load was considered under weight when\r\nfound to be 197 pounds. The apire had carried this up eighty\r\nperpendicular yards,—part of the way by a steep passage, but the\r\ngreater part up notched poles, placed in a zigzag line up the shaft.\r\nAccording to the general regulation, the apire is not allowed to halt\r\nfor breath, except the mine is six hundred feet deep. The average load\r\nis considered as rather more than 200 pounds, and I have been assured\r\nthat one of 300 pounds (twenty-two stone and a half) by way of a trial\r\nhas been brought up from the deepest mine! At this time the apires were\r\nbringing up the usual load twelve times in the day; that is 2400 pounds\r\nfrom eighty yards deep; and they were employed in the intervals in\r\nbreaking and picking ore.\r\n\r\nThese men, excepting from accidents, are healthy, and appear cheerful.\r\nTheir bodies are not very muscular. They rarely eat meat once a week,\r\nand never oftener, and then only the hard dry charqui. Although with a\r\nknowledge that the labour was voluntary, it was nevertheless quite\r\nrevolting to see the state in which they reached the mouth of the mine;\r\ntheir bodies bent forward, leaning with their arms on the steps, their\r\nlegs bowed, their muscles quivering, the perspiration streaming from\r\ntheir faces over their breasts, their nostrils distended, the corners\r\nof their mouth forcibly drawn back, and the expulsion of their\r\nbreath most laborious. Each time they draw their breath they utter an\r\narticulate cry of “ay-ay,” which ends in a sound rising from deep in\r\nthe chest, but shrill like the note of a fife. After staggering to the\r\npile of ore, they emptied the “carpacho;” in two or three seconds\r\nrecovering their breath, they wiped the sweat from their brows, and\r\napparently quite fresh descended the mine again at a quick pace. This\r\nappears to me a wonderful instance of the amount of labour which habit,\r\nfor it can be nothing else, will enable a man to endure.\r\n\r\nIn the evening, talking with the _mayor-domo_ of these mines about the\r\nnumber of foreigners now scattered over the whole country, he told me\r\nthat, though quite a young man, he remembers when he was a boy at\r\nschool at Coquimbo, a holiday being given to see the captain of an\r\nEnglish ship, who was brought to the city to speak to the governor. He\r\nbelieves that nothing would have induced any boy in the school, himself\r\nincluded, to have gone close to the Englishman; so deeply had they been\r\nimpressed with an idea of the heresy, contamination, and evil to be\r\nderived from contact with such a person. To this day they relate the\r\natrocious actions of the bucaniers; and especially of one man, who took\r\naway the figure of the Virgin Mary, and returned the year after for\r\nthat of St. Joseph, saying it was a pity the lady should not have a\r\nhusband. I heard also of an old lady who, at a dinner at Coquimbo,\r\nremarked how wonderfully strange it was that she should have lived to\r\ndine in the same room with an Englishman; for she remembered as a girl,\r\nthat twice, at the mere cry of “Los Ingleses,” every soul, carrying\r\nwhat valuables they could, had taken to the mountains.\r\n\r\n14_th._—We reached Coquimbo, where we stayed a few days. The town is\r\nremarkable for nothing but its extreme quietness. It is said to contain\r\nfrom 6000 to 8000 inhabitants. On the morning of the 17th it rained\r\nlightly, the first time this year, for about five hours. The farmers,\r\nwho plant corn near the sea-coast where the atmosphere is more humid,\r\ntaking advantage of this shower, would break up the ground; after a\r\nsecond they would put the seed in; and if a third shower should fall,\r\nthey would reap a good harvest in the spring. It was interesting to\r\nwatch the effect of this trifling amount of moisture. Twelve hours\r\nafterwards the ground appeared as dry as ever; yet after an interval of\r\nten days all the hills were faintly tinged with green\r\npatches; the grass being sparingly scattered in hair-like fibres a full\r\ninch in length. Before this shower every part of the surface was bare\r\nas on a high-road.\r\n\r\nCoquimbo, Chile\r\n\r\nIn the evening, Captain Fitz Roy and myself were dining with Mr.\r\nEdwards, an English resident well known for his hospitality by all who\r\nhave visited Coquimbo, when a sharp earthquake happened. I heard the\r\nforecoming rumble, but from the screams of the ladies, the running of\r\nthe servants, and the rush of several of the gentlemen to the doorway,\r\nI could not distinguish the motion. Some of the women afterwards were\r\ncrying with terror, and one gentleman said he should not be able to\r\nsleep all night, or if he did, it would only be to dream of falling\r\nhouses. The father of this person had lately lost all his property at\r\nTalcahuano, and he himself had only just escaped a falling roof at\r\nValparaiso in 1822. He mentioned a curious coincidence which then\r\nhappened: he was playing at cards, when a German, one of the party, got\r\nup, and said he would never sit in a room in these countries with the\r\ndoor shut, as, owing to his having done so, he had nearly lost his life\r\nat Copiapó.\r\nAccordingly he opened the door; and no sooner had he done this, than he\r\ncried out, “Here it comes again!” and the famous shock commenced. The\r\nwhole party escaped. The danger in an earthquake is not from the time\r\nlost in opening the door, but from the chance of its becoming jammed by\r\nthe movement of the walls.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to be much surprised at the fear which natives and old\r\nresidents, though some of them known to be men of great command of\r\nmind, so generally experience during earthquakes. I think, however,\r\nthis excess of panic may be partly attributed to a want of habit in\r\ngoverning their fear, as it is not a feeling they are ashamed of.\r\nIndeed, the natives do not like to see a person indifferent. I heard of\r\ntwo Englishmen who, sleeping in the open air during a smart shock,\r\nknowing that there was no danger, did not rise. The natives cried out\r\nindignantly, “Look at those heretics, they do not even get out of their\r\nbeds!”\r\n\r\n\r\nI spent some days in examining the step-formed terraces of shingle,\r\nfirst noticed by Captain B. Hall, and believed by Mr. Lyell to have\r\nbeen formed by the sea during the gradual rising of the land. This\r\ncertainly is the true explanation, for I found numerous shells of\r\nexisting species on these terraces. Five narrow, gently sloping,\r\nfringe-like terraces rise one behind the other, and where best\r\ndeveloped are formed of shingle: they front the bay, and sweep up both\r\nsides of the valley. At Guasco, north of Coquimbo, the phenomenon is\r\ndisplayed on a much grander scale, so as to strike with surprise even\r\nsome of the inhabitants. The terraces are there much broader, and may\r\nbe called plains, in some parts there are six of them, but generally\r\nonly five; they run up the valley for thirty-seven miles from the\r\ncoast. These step-formed terraces or fringes closely resemble those in\r\nthe valley of S. Cruz, and, except in being on a smaller scale, those\r\ngreat ones along the whole coast-line of Patagonia. They have\r\nundoubtedly been formed by the denuding power of the sea, during long\r\nperiods of rest in the gradual elevation of the continent.\r\n\r\nShells of many existing species not only lie on the surface of the\r\nterraces at Coquimbo (to a height of 250 feet), but are embedded in a\r\nfriable calcareous rock, which in some places is\r\nas much as between twenty and thirty feet in thickness, but is of\r\nlittle extent. These modern beds rest on an ancient tertiary formation\r\ncontaining shells, apparently all extinct. Although I examined so many\r\nhundred miles of coast on the Pacific, as well as Atlantic side of the\r\ncontinent, I found no regular strata containing sea-shells of recent\r\nspecies, excepting at this place, and at a few points northward on the\r\nroad to Guasco. This fact appears to me highly remarkable; for the\r\nexplanation generally given by geologists, of the absence in any\r\ndistrict of stratified fossiliferous deposits of a given period,\r\nnamely, that the surface then existed as dry land, is not here\r\napplicable; for we know from the shells strewed on the surface and\r\nembedded in loose sand or mould, that the land for thousands of miles\r\nalong both coasts has lately been submerged. The explanation, no doubt,\r\nmust be sought in the fact, that the whole southern part of the\r\ncontinent has been for a long time slowly rising; and therefore that\r\nall matter deposited along shore in shallow water must have been soon\r\nbrought up and slowly exposed to the wearing action of the sea-beach;\r\nand it is only in comparatively shallow water that the greater number\r\nof marine organic beings can flourish, and in such water it is\r\nobviously impossible that strata of any great thickness can accumulate.\r\nTo show the vast power of the wearing action of sea-beaches, we need\r\nonly appeal to the great cliffs along the present coast of Patagonia,\r\nand to the escarpments or ancient sea-cliffs at different levels, one\r\nabove another, on that same line of coast.\r\n\r\nThe old underlying tertiary formation at Coquimbo appears to be of\r\nabout the same age with several deposits on the coast of Chile (of\r\nwhich that of Navedad is the principal one), and with the great\r\nformation of Patagonia. Both at Navedad and in Patagonia there is\r\nevidence, that since the shells (a list of which has been seen by\r\nProfessor E. Forbes) there intombed were living, there has been a\r\nsubsidence of several hundred feet, as well as an ensuing elevation. It\r\nmay naturally be asked how it comes that although no extensive\r\nfossiliferous deposits of the recent period, nor of any period\r\nintermediate between it and the ancient tertiary epoch, have been\r\npreserved on either side of the continent, yet that at this ancient\r\ntertiary epoch, sedimentary matter containing fossil remains should\r\nhave been deposited and preserved at different points in north and\r\nsouth\r\nlines, over a space of 1100 miles on the shores of the Pacific, and of\r\nat least 1350 miles on the shores of the Atlantic, and in an east and\r\nwest line of 700 miles across the widest part of the continent? I\r\nbelieve the explanation is not difficult, and that it is perhaps\r\napplicable to nearly analogous facts observed in other quarters of the\r\nworld. Considering the enormous power of denudation which the sea\r\npossesses, as shown by numberless facts, it is not probable that a\r\nsedimentary deposit, when being upraised, could pass through the ordeal\r\nof the beach, so as to be preserved in sufficient masses to last to a\r\ndistant period, without it were originally of wide extent and of\r\nconsiderable thickness: now it is impossible on a moderately shallow\r\nbottom, which alone is favourable to most living creatures, that a\r\nthick and widely extended covering of sediment could be spread out,\r\nwithout the bottom sank down to receive the successive layers. This\r\nseems to have actually taken place at about the same period in southern\r\nPatagonia and Chile, though these places are a thousand miles apart.\r\nHence, if prolonged movements of approximately contemporaneous\r\nsubsidence are generally widely extensive, as I am strongly inclined to\r\nbelieve from my examination of the Coral Reefs of the great oceans—or\r\nif, confining our view to South America, the subsiding movements have\r\nbeen coextensive with those of elevation, by which, within the same\r\nperiod of existing shells, the shores of Peru, Chile, Tierra del Fuego,\r\nPatagonia, and La Plata have been upraised—then we can see that at the\r\nsame time, at far distant points, circumstances would have been\r\nfavourable to the formation of fossiliferous deposits, of wide extent\r\nand of considerable thickness; and such deposits, consequently, would\r\nhave a good chance of resisting the wear and tear of successive\r\nbeach-lines, and of lasting to a future epoch.\r\n\r\n\r\n_May_ 21_st._—I set out in company with Don Jose Edwards to the\r\nsilver-mine of Arqueros, and thence up the valley of Coquimbo. Passing\r\nthrough a mountainous country, we reached by nightfall the mines\r\nbelonging to Mr. Edwards. I enjoyed my night’s rest here from a reason\r\nwhich will not be fully appreciated in England, namely, the absence of\r\nfleas! The rooms in Coquimbo swarm with them; but they will not\r\nlive here at the height of only three or four thousand feet: it can\r\nscarcely be the trifling diminution of temperature, but some other\r\ncause which destroys these troublesome insects at this place. The mines\r\nare now in a bad state, though they formerly yielded about 2000 pounds\r\nin weight of silver a year. It has been said that “a person with a\r\ncopper-mine will gain; with silver he may gain; but with gold he is\r\nsure to lose.” This is not true: all the large Chilian fortunes have\r\nbeen made by mines of the more precious metals. A short time since an\r\nEnglish physician returned to England from Copiapó, taking with him the\r\nprofits of one share in a silver-mine, which amounted to about 24,000\r\npounds sterling. No doubt a copper-mine with care is a sure game,\r\nwhereas the other is gambling, or rather taking a ticket in a lottery.\r\nThe owners lose great quantities of rich ores; for no precautions can\r\nprevent robberies. I heard of a gentleman laying a bet with another,\r\nthat one of his men should rob him before his face. The ore when\r\nbrought out of the mine is broken into pieces, and the useless stone\r\nthrown on one side. A couple of the miners who were thus employed,\r\npitched, as if by accident, two fragments away at the same moment, and\r\nthen cried out for a joke “Let us see which rolls furthest.” The owner,\r\nwho was standing by, bet a cigar with his friend on the race. The miner\r\nby this means watched the very point amongst the rubbish where the\r\nstone lay. In the evening he picked it up and carried it to his master,\r\nshowing him a rich mass of silver-ore, and saying, “This was the stone\r\non which you won a cigar by its rolling so far.”\r\n\r\n_May_ 23_rd._—We descended into the fertile valley of Coquimbo, and\r\nfollowed it till we reached an Hacienda belonging to a relation of Don\r\nJose, where we stayed the next day. I then rode one day’s journey\r\nfarther, to see what were declared to be some petrified shells and\r\nbeans, which latter turned out to be small quartz pebbles. We passed\r\nthrough several small villages; and the valley was beautifully\r\ncultivated, and the whole scenery very grand. We were here near the\r\nmain Cordillera, and the surrounding hills were lofty. In all parts of\r\nNorthern Chile fruit trees produce much more abundantly at a\r\nconsiderable height near the Andes than in the lower country. The figs\r\nand grapes of this district are\r\nfamous for their excellence, and are cultivated to a great extent. This\r\nvalley is, perhaps, the most productive one north of Quillota. I\r\nbelieve it contains, including Coquimbo, 25,000 inhabitants. The next\r\nday I returned to the Hacienda, and thence, together with Don Jose, to\r\nCoquimbo.\r\n\r\n_June_ 2_nd._—We set out for the valley of Guasco, following the\r\ncoast-road, which was considered rather less desert than the other. Our\r\nfirst day’s ride was to a solitary house, called Yerba Buena, where\r\nthere was pasture for our horses. The shower mentioned as having fallen\r\na fortnight ago, only reached about half-way to Guasco; we had,\r\ntherefore, in the first part of our journey a most faint tinge of\r\ngreen, which soon faded quite away. Even where brightest, it was\r\nscarcely sufficient to remind one of the fresh turf and budding flowers\r\nof the spring of other countries. While travelling through these\r\ndeserts one feels like a prisoner shut up in a gloomy court, who longs\r\nto see something green and to smell a moist atmosphere.\r\n\r\n_June_ 3_rd._—Yerba Buena to Carizal. During the first part of the day\r\nwe crossed a mountainous rocky desert, and afterwards a long deep sandy\r\nplain, strewed with broken sea-shells. There was very little water, and\r\nthat little saline: the whole country, from the coast to the\r\nCordillera, is an uninhabited desert. I saw traces only of one living\r\nanimal in abundance, namely, the shells of a Bulimus, which were\r\ncollected together in extraordinary numbers on the driest spots. In the\r\nspring one humble little plant sends out a few leaves, and on these the\r\nsnails feed. As they are seen only very early in the morning, when the\r\nground is slightly damp with dew, the Guasos believe that they are bred\r\nfrom it. I have observed in other places that extremely dry and sterile\r\ndistricts, where the soil is calcareous, are extraordinarily favourable\r\nto land-shells. At Carizal there were a few cottages, some brackish\r\nwater, and a trace of cultivation: but it was with difficulty that we\r\npurchased a little corn and straw for our horses.\r\n\r\n4_th._—Carizal to Sauce. We continued to ride over desert plains,\r\ntenanted by large herds of guanaco. We crossed also the valley of\r\nChañeral; which, although the most fertile one between Guasco and\r\nCoquimbo, is very narrow, and produces so little pasture that we could\r\nnot purchase any for our horses. At Sauce we found a very civil old\r\ngentleman, superintending\r\na copper-smelting furnace. As an especial favour, he allowed me to\r\npurchase at a high price an armful of dirty straw, which was all the\r\npoor horses had for supper after their long day’s journey. Few\r\nsmelting-furnaces are now at work in any part of Chile; it is found\r\nmore profitable, on account of the extreme scarcity of firewood, and\r\nfrom the Chilian method of reduction being so unskilful, to ship the\r\nore for Swansea. The next day we crossed some mountains to Freyrina, in\r\nthe valley of Guasco. During each day’s ride farther northward, the\r\nvegetation became more and more scanty; even the great chandelier-like\r\ncactus was here replaced by a different and much smaller species.\r\nDuring the winter months, both in Northern Chile and in Peru, a uniform\r\nbank of clouds hangs, at no great height, over the Pacific. From the\r\nmountains we had a very striking view of this white and brilliant\r\naërial field, which sent arms up the valleys, leaving islands and\r\npromontories in the same manner as the sea does in the Chonos\r\narchipelago and in Tierra del Fuego.\r\n\r\nWe stayed two days at Freyrina. In the valley of Guasco there are four\r\nsmall towns. At the mouth there is the port, a spot entirely desert,\r\nand without any water in the immediate neighbourhood. Five leagues\r\nhigher up stands Freyrina, a long straggling village, with decent\r\nwhitewashed houses. Again, ten leagues further up Ballenar is situated,\r\nand above this Guasco Alto, a horticultural village, famous for its\r\ndried fruit. On a clear day the view up the valley is very fine; the\r\nstraight opening terminates in the far-distant snowy Cordillera; on\r\neach side an infinity of crossing lines are blended together in a\r\nbeautiful haze. The foreground is singular from the number of parallel\r\nand step-formed terraces; and the included strip of green valley, with\r\nits willow-bushes, is contrasted on both hands with the naked hills.\r\nThat the surrounding country was most barren will be readily believed,\r\nwhen it is known that a shower of rain had not fallen during the last\r\nthirteen months. The inhabitants heard with the greatest envy of the\r\nrain at Coquimbo; from the appearance of the sky they had hopes of\r\nequally good fortune, which, a fortnight afterwards, were realised. I\r\nwas at Copiapó at the time; and there the people, with equal envy,\r\ntalked of the abundant rain at Guasco. After two or three very dry\r\nyears, perhaps with not more than one shower during the\r\nwhole time, a rainy year generally follows; and this does more harm\r\nthan even the drought. The rivers swell, and cover with gravel and sand\r\nthe narrow strips of ground which alone are fit for cultivation. The\r\nfloods also injure the irrigating ditches. Great devastation had thus\r\nbeen caused three years ago.\r\n\r\n_June_ 8_th._—We rode on to Ballenar, which takes its name from\r\nBallenagh in Ireland, the birthplace of the family of O’Higgins, who,\r\nunder the Spanish government, were presidents and generals in Chile. As\r\nthe rocky mountains on each hand were concealed by clouds, the\r\nterrace-like plains gave to the valley an appearance like that of Santa\r\nCruz in Patagonia. After spending one day at Ballenar I set out, on the\r\n10th, for the upper part of the valley of Copiapó. We rode all day over\r\nan uninteresting country. I am tired of repeating the epithets barren\r\nand sterile. These words, however, as commonly used, are comparative; I\r\nhave always applied them to the plains of Patagonia, which can boast of\r\nspiny bushes and some tufts of grass; and this is absolute fertility,\r\nas compared with Northern Chile. Here again, there are not many spaces\r\nof two hundred yards square, where some little bush, cactus or lichen,\r\nmay not be discovered by careful examination; and in the soil seeds lie\r\ndormant ready to spring up during the first rainy winter. In Peru real\r\ndeserts occur over wide tracts of country. In the evening we arrived at\r\na valley in which the bed of the streamlet was damp: following it up,\r\nwe came to tolerably good water. During the night the stream, from not\r\nbeing evaporated and absorbed so quickly, flows a league lower down\r\nthan during the day. Sticks were plentiful for firewood, so that it was\r\na good place of bivouac for us; but for the poor animals there was not\r\na mouthful to eat.\r\n\r\n_June_ 11_th._—We rode without stopping for twelve hours till we\r\nreached an old smelting-furnace, where there was water and firewood;\r\nbut our horses again had nothing to eat, being shut up in an old\r\ncourtyard. The line of road was hilly, and the distant views\r\ninteresting from the varied colours of the bare mountains. It was\r\nalmost a pity to see the sun shining constantly over so useless a\r\ncountry; such splendid weather ought to have brightened fields and\r\npretty gardens. The next day we reached the valley of Copiapó. I was\r\nheartily glad of it; for the whole journey was a continued source of\r\nanxiety;\r\nit was most disagreeable to hear, whilst eating our own suppers, our\r\nhorses gnawing the posts to which they were tied, and to have no means\r\nof relieving their hunger. To all appearance, however, the animals were\r\nquite fresh; and no one could have told that they had eaten nothing for\r\nthe last fifty-five hours.\r\n\r\nI had a letter of introduction to Mr. Bingley, who received me very\r\nkindly at the Hacienda of Potrero Seco. This estate is between twenty\r\nand thirty miles long, but very narrow, being generally only two fields\r\nwide, one on each side the river. In some parts the estate is of no\r\nwidth, that is to say, the land cannot be irrigated, and therefore is\r\nvalueless, like the surrounding rocky desert. The small quantity of\r\ncultivated land in the whole line of valley does not so much depend on\r\ninequalities of level, and consequent unfitness for irrigation, as on\r\nthe small supply of water. The river this year was remarkably full:\r\nhere, high up the valley, it reached to the horse’s belly, and was\r\nabout fifteen yards wide, and rapid; lower down it becomes smaller and\r\nsmaller, and is generally quite lost, as happened during one period of\r\nthirty years, so that not a drop entered the sea. The inhabitants watch\r\na storm over the Cordillera with great interest; as one good fall of\r\nsnow provides them with water for the ensuing year. This is of\r\ninfinitely more consequence than rain in the lower country. Rain, as\r\noften as it falls, which is about once in every two or three years, is\r\na great advantage, because the cattle and mules can for some time\r\nafterwards find a little pasture in the mountains. But without snow on\r\nthe Andes, desolation extends throughout the valley. It is on record\r\nthat three times nearly all the inhabitants have been obliged to\r\nemigrate to the south. This year there was plenty of water, and every\r\nman irrigated his ground as much as he chose; but it has frequently\r\nbeen necessary to post soldiers at the sluices, to see that each estate\r\ntook only its proper allowance during so many hours in the week. The\r\nvalley is said to contain 12,000 souls, but its produce is sufficient\r\nonly for three months in the year; the rest of the supply being drawn\r\nfrom Valparaiso and the south. Before the discovery of the famous\r\nsilver-mines of Chanuncillo, Copiapó was in a rapid state of decay; but\r\nnow it is in a very thriving condition; and the town, which was\r\ncompletely overthrown by an earthquake, has been rebuilt.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe valley of Copiapó, forming a mere ribbon of green in a desert, runs\r\nin a very southerly direction; so that it is of considerable length to\r\nits source in the Cordillera. The valleys of Guasco and Copiapó may\r\nboth be considered as long narrow islands, separated from the rest of\r\nChile by deserts of rock instead of by salt water. Northward of these,\r\nthere is one other very miserable valley, called Paposo, which contains\r\nabout two hundred souls; and then there extends the real desert of\r\nAtacama—a barrier far worse than the most turbulent ocean. After\r\nstaying a few days at Potrero Seco, I proceeded up the valley to the\r\nhouse of Don Benito Cruz, to whom I had a letter of introduction. I\r\nfound him most hospitable; indeed it is impossible to bear too strong\r\ntestimony to the kindness with which travellers are received in almost\r\nevery part of South America. The next day I hired some mules to take me\r\nby the ravine of Jolquera into the central Cordillera. On the second\r\nnight the weather seemed to foretell a storm of snow or rain, and\r\nwhilst lying in our beds we felt a trifling shock of an earthquake.\r\n\r\nThe connexion between earthquakes and the weather has been often\r\ndisputed: it appears to me to be a point of great interest, which is\r\nlittle understood. Humboldt has remarked in one part of the _ Personal\r\nNarrative,_[1] that it would be difficult for any person who had long\r\nresided in New Andalusia, or in Lower Peru, to deny that there exists\r\nsome connection between these phenomena: in another part, however, he\r\nseems to think the connexion fanciful. At Guayaquil it is said that a\r\nheavy shower in the dry season is invariably followed by an earthquake.\r\nIn Northern Chile, from the extreme infrequency of rain, or even of\r\nweather foreboding rain, the probability of accidental coincidences\r\nbecomes very small; yet the inhabitants are here most firmly convinced\r\nof some connexion between the state of the atmosphere and of the\r\ntrembling of the ground: I was much struck by this when mentioning to\r\nsome people at Copiapó that there had been a sharp shock at Coquimbo:\r\nthey\r\nimmediately cried out, “How fortunate! there will be plenty of pasture\r\nthere this year.” To their minds an earthquake foretold rain as surely\r\nas rain foretold abundant pasture. Certainly it did so happen that on\r\nthe very day of the earthquake that shower of rain fell which I have\r\ndescribed as in ten days’ time producing a thin sprinkling of grass. At\r\nother times rain has followed earthquakes at a period of the year when\r\nit is a far greater prodigy than the earthquake itself: this happened\r\nafter the shock of November 1822, and again in 1829 at Valparaiso; also\r\nafter that of September 1833, at Tacna. A person must be somewhat\r\nhabituated to the climate of these countries to perceive the extreme\r\nimprobability of rain falling at such seasons, except as a consequence\r\nof some law quite unconnected with the ordinary course of the weather.\r\nIn the cases of great volcanic eruptions, as that of Coseguina, where\r\ntorrents of rain fell at a time of the year most unusual for it, and\r\n“almost unprecedented in Central America,” it is not difficult to\r\nunderstand that the volumes of vapour and clouds of ashes might have\r\ndisturbed the atmospheric equilibrium. Humboldt extends this view to\r\nthe case of earthquakes unaccompanied by eruptions; but I can hardly\r\nconceive it possible that the small quantity of aëriform fluids which\r\nthen escape from the fissured ground can produce such remarkable\r\neffects. There appears much probability in the view first proposed by\r\nMr. P. Scrope, that when the barometer is low, and when rain might\r\nnaturally be expected to fall, the diminished pressure of the\r\natmosphere over a wide extent of country might well determine the\r\nprecise day on which the earth, already stretched to the utmost by the\r\nsubterranean forces, should yield, crack, and consequently tremble. It\r\nis, however, doubtful how far this idea will explain the circumstance\r\nof torrents of rain falling in the dry season during several days,\r\nafter an earthquake unaccompanied by an eruption; such cases seem to\r\nbespeak some more intimate connexion between the atmospheric and\r\nsubterranean regions.\r\n\r\n [1] Vol. iv, p. 11 and vol. ii, p. 217.

In the former\r\n edition I collected several references on the coincidences between\r\n sudden falls in the barometer and earthquakes; and between earthquakes\r\n and meteors.\r\n\r\nFinding little of interest in this part of the ravine, we retraced our\r\nsteps to the house of Don Benito, where I stayed two days collecting\r\nfossil shells and wood. Great prostrate silicified trunks of trees,\r\nembedded in a conglomerate, were\r\nextraordinarily numerous. I measured one which was fifteen feet in\r\ncircumference: how surprising it is that every atom of the woody matter\r\nin this great cylinder should have been removed and replaced by silex\r\nso perfectly that each vessel and pore is preserved! These trees\r\nflourished at about the period of our lower chalk; they all belonged to\r\nthe fir-tribe. It was amusing to hear the inhabitants discussing the\r\nnature of the fossil shells which I collected, almost in the same terms\r\nas were used a century ago in Europe,—namely, whether or not they had\r\nbeen thus “born by nature.” My geological examination of the country\r\ngenerally created a good deal of surprise amongst the Chilenos: it was\r\nlong before they could be convinced that I was not hunting for mines.\r\nThis was sometimes troublesome: I found the most ready way of\r\nexplaining my employment was to ask them how it was that they\r\nthemselves were not curious concerning earthquakes and volcanos?—why\r\nsome springs were hot and others cold?—why there were mountains in\r\nChile, and not a hill in La Plata? These bare questions at once\r\nsatisfied and silenced the greater number; some, however (like a few in\r\nEngland who are a century behindhand), thought that all such inquiries\r\nwere useless and impious; and that it was quite sufficient that God had\r\nthus made the mountains.\r\n\r\nAn order had recently been issued that all stray dogs should be killed,\r\nand we saw many lying dead on the road. A great number had lately gone\r\nmad, and several men had been bitten and had died in consequence. On\r\nseveral occasions hydrophobia has prevailed in this valley. It is\r\nremarkable thus to find so strange and dreadful a disease appearing\r\ntime after time in the same isolated spot. It has been remarked that\r\ncertain villages in England are in like manner much more subject to\r\nthis visitation than others. Dr. Unanùe states that hydrophobia was\r\nfirst known in South America in 1803: this statement is corroborated by\r\nAzara and Ulloa having never heard of it in their time. Dr. Unanùe says\r\nthat it broke out in Central America, and slowly travelled southward.\r\nIt reached Arequipa in 1807; and it is said that some men there, who\r\nhad not been bitten, were affected, as were some negroes, who had eaten\r\na bullock which had died of hydrophobia. At Ica forty-two people thus\r\nmiserably perished.\r\nThe disease came on between twelve and ninety days after the bite; and\r\nin those cases where it did come on, death ensued invariably within\r\nfive days. After 1808 a long interval ensued without any cases. On\r\ninquiry, I did not hear of hydrophobia in Van Diemen’s Land, or in\r\nAustralia; and Burchell says that during the five years he was at the\r\nCape of Good Hope, he never heard of an instance of it. Webster asserts\r\nthat at the Azores hydrophobia has never occurred; and the same\r\nassertion has been made with respect to Mauritius and St. Helena.[2] In\r\nso strange a disease some information might possibly be gained by\r\nconsidering the circumstances under which it originates in distant\r\nclimates; for it is improbable that a dog already bitten should have\r\nbeen brought to these distant countries.\r\n\r\n [2] _Observa. sobre el clima de Lima,_ p. 67.—Azara’s _Travels,_ vol.\r\n i, p. 381.—Ulloa’s _ Voyage,_ vol. ii, p. 28.—Burchell’s _Travels,_\r\n vol. ii, p. 524.—Webster’s _Description of the Azores,_ p.\r\n 124.—_Voyage à l’Isle de France par un Officier du Roi,_ tome i, p.\r\n 248.—_Description of St. Helena,_ p. 123.\r\n\r\nAt night a stranger arrived at the house of Don Benito and asked\r\npermission to sleep there. He said he had been wandering about the\r\nmountains for seventeen days, having lost his way. He started from\r\nGuasco, and being accustomed to travelling in the Cordillera, did not\r\nexpect any difficulty in following the track to Copiapó; but he soon\r\nbecame involved in a labyrinth of mountains whence he could not escape.\r\nSome of his mules had fallen over precipices and he had been in great\r\ndistress. His chief difficulty arose from not knowing where to find\r\nwater in the lower country, so that he was obliged to keep bordering\r\nthe central ranges.\r\n\r\nWe returned down the valley, and on the 22nd reached the town of\r\nCopiapó. The lower part of the valley is broad, forming a fine plain\r\nlike that of Quillota. The town covers a considerable space of ground,\r\neach house possessing a garden: but it is an uncomfortable place, and\r\nthe dwellings are poorly furnished. Every one seems bent on the one\r\nobject of making money, and then migrating as quickly as possible. All\r\nthe inhabitants are more or less directly concerned with mines; and\r\nmines and ores are the sole subjects of conversation. Necessaries of\r\nall sorts are extremely dear; as the distance from the town to the port\r\nis eighteen leagues, and the land\r\ncarriage very expensive. A fowl costs five or six shillings; meat is\r\nnearly as dear as in England; firewood, or rather sticks, are brought\r\non donkeys from a distance of two and three days’ journey within the\r\nCordillera; and pasturage for animals is a shilling a day: all this for\r\nSouth America is wonderfully exorbitant.\r\n\r\n\r\n_June_ 26_th._—I hired a guide and eight mules to take me into the\r\nCordillera by a different line from my last excursion. As the country\r\nwas utterly desert, we took a cargo and a half of barley mixed with\r\nchopped straw. About two leagues above the town a broad valley called\r\nthe “Despoblado,” or uninhabited, branches off from that one by which\r\nwe had arrived. Although a valley of the grandest dimensions, and\r\nleading to a pass across the Cordillera, yet it is completely dry,\r\nexcepting perhaps for a few days during some very rainy winter. The\r\nsides of the crumbling mountains were furrowed by scarcely any ravines;\r\nand the bottom of the main valley, filled with shingle, was smooth and\r\nnearly level. No considerable torrent could ever have flowed down this\r\nbed of shingle; for if it had, a great cliff-bounded channel, as in all\r\nthe southern valleys, would assuredly have been formed. I feel little\r\ndoubt that this valley, as well as those mentioned by travellers in\r\nPeru, were left in the state we now see them by the waves of the sea,\r\nas the land slowly rose. I observed in one place where the Despoblado\r\nwas joined by a ravine (which in almost any other chain would have been\r\ncalled a grand valley), that its bed, though composed merely of sand\r\nand gravel, was higher than that of its tributary. A mere rivulet of\r\nwater, in the course of an hour, would have cut a channel for itself;\r\nbut it was evident that ages had passed away, and no such rivulet had\r\ndrained this great tributary. It was curious to behold the machinery,\r\nif such a term may be used, for the drainage, all, with the last\r\ntrifling exception, perfect, yet without any signs of action. Every one\r\nmust have remarked how mud-banks, left by the retiring tide, imitate in\r\nminiature a country with hill and dale; and here we have the original\r\nmodel in rock, formed as the continent rose during the secular\r\nretirement of the ocean, instead of during the ebbing and flowing of\r\nthe tides. If a shower of rain falls on the\r\nmud-bank, when left dry, it deepens the already-formed shallow lines of\r\nexcavation; and so it is with the rain of successive centuries on the\r\nbank of rock and soil, which we call a continent.\r\n\r\nWe rode on after it was dark, till we reached a side ravine with a\r\nsmall well, called “Agua amarga.” The water deserved its name, for\r\nbesides being saline it was most offensively putrid and bitter; so that\r\nwe could not force ourselves to drink either tea or maté. I suppose the\r\ndistance from the river of Copiapó to this spot was at least\r\ntwenty-five or thirty English miles; in the whole space there was not a\r\nsingle drop of water, the country deserving the name of desert in the\r\nstrictest sense. Yet about half-way we passed some old Indian ruins\r\nnear Punta Gorda: I noticed also in front of some of the valleys which\r\nbranch off from the Despoblado, two piles of stones placed a little way\r\napart, and directed so as to point up the mouths of these small\r\nvalleys. My companions knew nothing about them, and only answered my\r\nqueries by their imperturbable “quien sabe?”\r\n\r\nI observed Indian ruins in several parts of the Cordillera: the most\r\nperfect which I saw were the Ruinas de Tambillos in the Uspallata Pass.\r\nSmall square rooms were there huddled together in separate groups: some\r\nof the doorways were yet standing; they were formed by a cross slab of\r\nstone only about three feet high. Ulloa has remarked on the lowness of\r\nthe doors in the ancient Peruvian dwellings. These houses, when\r\nperfect, must have been capable of containing a considerable number of\r\npersons. Tradition says that they were used as halting-places for the\r\nIncas, when they crossed the mountains. Traces of Indian habitations\r\nhave been discovered in many other parts, where it does not appear\r\nprobable that they were used as mere resting-places, but yet where the\r\nland is as utterly unfit for any kind of cultivation as it is near the\r\nTambillos or at the Incas Bridge, or in the Portillo Pass, at all which\r\nplaces I saw ruins. In the ravine of Jajuel, near Aconcagua, where\r\nthere is no pass, I heard of remains of houses situated at a great\r\nheight, where it is extremely cold and sterile. At first I imagined\r\nthat these buildings had been places of refuge, built by the Indians on\r\nthe first arrival of the Spaniards; but I have since been inclined to\r\nspeculate on the probability of a small change of climate.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this northern part of Chile, within the Cordillera, old Indian\r\nhouses are said to be especially numerous: by digging amongst the\r\nruins, bits of woollen articles, instruments of precious metals, and\r\nheads of Indian corn, are not unfrequently discovered: an arrow-head\r\nmade of agate, and of precisely the same form with those now used in\r\nTierra del Fuego, was given me. I am aware that the Peruvian Indians\r\nnow frequently inhabit most lofty and bleak situations; but at Copiapó\r\nI was assured by men who had spent their lives in travelling through\r\nthe Andes, that there were very many (_muchisimas_) buildings at\r\nheights so great as almost to border on the perpetual snow, and in\r\nparts where there exist no passes, and where the land produces\r\nabsolutely nothing, and what is still more extraordinary, where there\r\nis no water. Nevertheless it is the opinion of the people of the\r\ncountry (although they are much puzzled by the circumstance), that,\r\nfrom the appearance of the houses, the Indians must have used them as\r\nplaces of residence. In this valley, at Punta Gorda, the remains\r\nconsisted of seven or eight square little rooms, which were of a\r\nsimilar form with those at Tambillos, but built chiefly of mud, which\r\nthe present inhabitants cannot, either here or, according to Ulloa, in\r\nPeru, imitate in durability. They were situated in the most conspicuous\r\nand defenceless position, at the bottom of the flat broad valley. There\r\nwas no water nearer than three or four leagues, and that only in very\r\nsmall quantity, and bad: the soil was absolutely sterile; I looked in\r\nvain even for a lichen adhering to the rocks. At the present day, with\r\nthe advantage of beasts of burden, a mine, unless it were very rich,\r\ncould scarcely be worked here with profit. Yet the Indians formerly\r\nchose it as a place of residence! If at the present time two or three\r\nshowers of rain were to fall annually, instead of one, as now is the\r\ncase, during as many years, a small rill of water would probably be\r\nformed in this great valley; and then, by irrigation (which was\r\nformerly so well understood by the Indians), the soil would easily be\r\nrendered sufficiently productive to support a few families.\r\n\r\nI have convincing proofs that this part of the continent of South\r\nAmerica has been elevated near the coast at least from 400 to 500, and\r\nin some parts from 1000 to 1300 feet, since the epoch of existing\r\nshells; and farther inland the rise possibly\r\nmay have been greater. As the peculiarly arid character of the climate\r\nis evidently a consequence of the height of the Cordillera, we may feel\r\nalmost sure that before the later elevations, the atmosphere could not\r\nhave been so completely drained of its moisture as it now is; and as\r\nthe rise has been gradual, so would have been the change in climate. On\r\nthis notion of a change of climate since the buildings were inhabited,\r\nthe ruins must be of extreme antiquity, but I do not think their\r\npreservation under the Chilian climate any great difficulty. We must\r\nalso admit on this notion (and this perhaps is a greater difficulty)\r\nthat man has inhabited South America for an immensely long period,\r\ninasmuch as any change of climate effected by the elevation of the land\r\nmust have been extremely gradual. At Valparaiso, within the last 220\r\nyears, the rise has been somewhat less than 19 feet: at Lima a\r\nsea-beach has certainly been upheaved from 80 to 90 feet, within the\r\nIndio-human period: but such small elevations could have had little\r\npower in deflecting the moisture-bringing atmospheric currents. Dr.\r\nLund, however, found human skeletons in the caves of Brazil, the\r\nappearance of which induced him to believe that the Indian race has\r\nexisted during a vast lapse of time in South America.\r\n\r\nWhen at Lima, I conversed on these subjects[3] with Mr. Gill, a civil\r\nengineer, who had seen much of the interior country. He told me that a\r\nconjecture of a change of climate had sometimes crossed his mind; but\r\nthat he thought that the greater portion of land, now incapable of\r\ncultivation, but covered with Indian ruins, had been reduced to this\r\nstate by the water-conduits, which the Indians formerly constructed on\r\nso wonderful a scale, having been injured by neglect and by\r\nsubterranean movements. I may here mention that the Peruvians actually\r\ncarried their irrigating streams in tunnels through hills of solid\r\nrock. Mr. Gill told me he had been employed professionally to examine\r\none: he found the passage low, narrow, crooked, and not of uniform\r\nbreadth, but of very considerable length. Is it not most wonderful that\r\nmen should\r\nhave attempted such operations, without the use of iron or gunpowder?\r\nMr. Gill also mentioned to me a most interesting, and, as far as I am\r\naware, quite unparalleled case, of a subterranean disturbance having\r\nchanged the drainage of a country. Travelling from Casma to Huaraz (not\r\nvery far distant from Lima), he found a plain covered with ruins and\r\nmarks of ancient cultivation but now quite barren. Near it was the dry\r\ncourse of a considerable river, whence the water for irrigation had\r\nformerly been conducted. There was nothing in the appearance of the\r\nwatercourse to indicate that the river had not flowed there a few years\r\npreviously; in some parts, beds of sand and gravel were spread out; in\r\nothers, the solid rock had been worn into a broad channel, which in one\r\nspot was about 40 yards in breadth and 8 feet deep. It is self-evident\r\nthat a person following up the course of a stream will always ascend at\r\na greater or less inclination: Mr. Gill, therefore, was much\r\nastonished, when walking up the bed of this ancient river, to find\r\nhimself suddenly going down hill. He imagined that the downward slope\r\nhad a fall of about 40 or 50 feet perpendicular. We here have\r\nunequivocal evidence that a ridge had been uplifted right across the\r\nold bed of a stream. From the moment the river-course was thus arched,\r\nthe water must necessarily have been thrown back, and a new channel\r\nformed. From that moment, also, the neighbouring plain must have lost\r\nits fertilising stream, and become a desert.\r\n\r\n [3] Temple, in his travels through Upper Peru, or Bolivia, in going\r\n from Potosi to Oruro, says “I saw many Indian villages or dwellings in\r\n ruins, up even to the very tops of the mountains, attesting a former\r\n population where now all is desolate.” He makes similar remarks in\r\n another place; but I cannot tell whether this desolation has been\r\n caused by a want of population, or by an altered condition of the\r\n land.\r\n\r\n\r\n_June_ 27_th._—We set out early in the morning, and by mid-day reached\r\nthe ravine of Paypote, where there is a tiny rill of water, with a\r\nlittle vegetation, and even a few algarroba trees, a kind of mimosa.\r\nFrom having firewood, a smelting-furnace had formerly been built here:\r\nwe found a solitary man in charge of it, whose sole employment was\r\nhunting guanacos. At night it froze sharply; but having plenty of wood\r\nfor our fire, we kept ourselves warm.\r\n\r\n_June_ 28_th._—We continued gradually ascending, and the valley now\r\nchanged into a ravine. During the day we saw several guanacos, and the\r\ntrack of the closely-allied species, the Vicuña: this latter animal is\r\npre-eminently alpine in its habits; it seldom descends much below the\r\nlimit of perpetual snow, and therefore haunts even a more lofty and\r\nsterile situation than the guanaco.\r\nThe only other animal which we saw in any number was a small fox: I\r\nsuppose this animal preys on the mice and other small rodents which, as\r\nlong as there is the least vegetation, subsist in considerable numbers\r\nin very desert places. In Patagonia, even on the borders of the\r\nsalinas, where a drop of fresh water can never be found, excepting dew,\r\nthese little animals swarm. Next to lizards, mice appear to be able to\r\nsupport existence on the smallest and driest portions of the earth—even\r\non islets in the midst of great oceans.\r\n\r\nThe scene on all sides showed desolation, brightened and made palpable\r\nby a clear, unclouded sky. For a time such scenery is sublime, but this\r\nfeeling cannot last, and then it becomes uninteresting. We bivouacked\r\nat the foot of the “primera linea,” or the first line of the partition\r\nof the waters. The streams, however, on the east side do not flow to\r\nthe Atlantic, but into an elevated district, in the middle of which\r\nthere is a large salina, or salt lake;—thus forming a little Caspian\r\nSea at the height, perhaps, of ten thousand feet. Where we slept, there\r\nwere some considerable patches of snow, but they do not remain\r\nthroughout the year. The winds in these lofty regions obey very regular\r\nlaws; every day a fresh breeze blows up the valley, and at night, an\r\nhour or two after sunset, the air from the cold regions above descends\r\nas through a funnel. This night it blew a gale of wind, and the\r\ntemperature must have been considerably below the freezing-point, for\r\nwater in a vessel soon became a block of ice. No clothes seemed to\r\noppose any obstacle to the air; I suffered very much from the cold, so\r\nthat I could not sleep, and in the morning rose with my body quite dull\r\nand benumbed.\r\n\r\nIn the Cordillera farther southward people lose their lives from\r\nsnow-storms; here, it sometimes happens from another cause. My guide,\r\nwhen a boy of fourteen years old, was passing the Cordillera with a\r\nparty in the month of May; and while in the central parts, a furious\r\ngale of wind arose, so that the men could hardly cling on their mules,\r\nand stones were flying along the ground. The day was cloudless, and not\r\na speck of snow fell, but the temperature was low. It is probable that\r\nthe thermometer would not have stood very many degrees below the\r\nfreezing-point, but the effect on their bodies, ill protected by\r\nclothing, must have been in proportion to the rapidity of the current\r\nof cold air. The gale lasted for more than a day; the\r\nmen began to lose their strength, and the mules would not move onwards.\r\nMy guide’s brother tried to return, but he perished, and his body was\r\nfound two years afterwards, lying by the side of his mule near the\r\nroad, with the bridle still in his hand. Two other men in the party\r\nlost their fingers and toes; and out of two hundred mules and thirty\r\ncows, only fourteen mules escaped alive. Many years ago the whole of a\r\nlarge party are supposed to have perished from a similar cause, but\r\ntheir bodies to this day have never been discovered. The union of a\r\ncloudless sky, low temperature, and a furious gale of wind, must be, I\r\nshould think, in all parts of the world an unusual occurrence.\r\n\r\n\r\n_June_ 29_th._—We gladly travelled down the valley to our former\r\nnight’s lodging, and thence to near the Agua amarga. On July 1st we\r\nreached the valley of Copiapó. The smell of the fresh clover was quite\r\ndelightful, after the scentless air of the dry sterile Despoblado.\r\nWhilst staying in the town I heard an account from several of the\r\ninhabitants, of a hill in the neighbourhood which they called “El\r\nBramador,”—the roarer or bellower. I did not at the time pay sufficient\r\nattention to the account; but, as far as I understood, the hill was\r\ncovered by sand, and the noise was produced only when people, by\r\nascending it, put the sand in motion. The same circumstances are\r\ndescribed in detail on the authority of Seetzen and Ehrenberg,[4] as\r\nthe cause of the sounds which have been heard by many travellers on\r\nMount Sinai near the Red Sea. One person with whom I conversed had\r\nhimself heard the noise: he described it as very surprising; and he\r\ndistinctly stated that, although he could not understand how it was\r\ncaused, yet it was necessary to set the sand rolling down the\r\nacclivity. A horse walking over dry and coarse sand causes a peculiar\r\nchirping noise from the friction of the particles; a circumstance which\r\nI several times noticed on the coast of Brazil.\r\n\r\n [4] _Edinburgh Phil. Journ._ Jan. 1830, p. 74; and April 1830, p 258.\r\n Also Daubeny on Volcanoes, p. 438; and _ Bengal Journ._ vol. vii, p.\r\n 324.\r\n\r\nThree days afterwards I heard of the _Beagle’s_ arrival at the Port,\r\ndistant eighteen leagues from the town. There is very little land\r\ncultivated down the valley; its wide expanse supports a wretched wiry\r\ngrass, which even the donkeys can hardly eat.\r\nThis poorness of the vegetation is owing to the quantity of saline\r\nmatter with which the soil is impregnated. The Port consists of an\r\nassemblage of miserable little hovels, situated at the foot of a\r\nsterile plain. At present, as the river contains water enough to reach\r\nthe sea, the inhabitants enjoy the advantage of having fresh water\r\nwithin a mile and a half. On the beach there were large piles of\r\nmerchandise, and the little place had an air of activity. In the\r\nevening I gave my adios, with a hearty good-will, to my companion\r\nMariano Gonzales, with whom I had ridden so many leagues in Chile. The\r\nnext morning the _Beagle_ sailed for Iquique.\r\n\r\n\r\n_July_ 12_th._—We anchored in the port of Iquique, in latitude 20° 12′,\r\non the coast of Peru. The town contains about a thousand inhabitants,\r\nand stands on a little plain of sand at the foot of a great wall of\r\nrock, 2000 feet in height, here forming the coast. The whole is utterly\r\ndesert. A light shower of rain falls only once in very many years; and\r\nthe ravines consequently are filled with detritus, and the\r\nmountainsides covered by piles of fine white sand, even to a height of\r\na thousand feet. During this season of the year a heavy bank of clouds,\r\nstretched over the ocean, seldom rises above the wall of rocks on the\r\ncoast. The aspect of the place was most gloomy; the little port, with\r\nits few vessels, and small group of wretched houses, seemed overwhelmed\r\nand out of all proportion with the rest of the scene.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants live like persons on board a ship: every necessary\r\ncomes from a distance: water is brought in boats from Pisagua, about\r\nforty miles northward, and is sold at the rate of nine reals (4s. 6d.)\r\nan eighteen-gallon cask: I bought a wine-bottle full for threepence. In\r\nlike manner firewood, and of course every article of food, is imported.\r\nVery few animals can be maintained in such a place: on the ensuing\r\nmorning I hired with difficulty, at the price of four pounds sterling,\r\ntwo mules and a guide to take me to the nitrate of soda works. These\r\nare at present the support of Iquique. This salt was first exported in\r\n1830: in one year an amount in value of one hundred thousand pounds\r\nsterling was sent to France and England. It is principally used as a\r\nmanure and in the manufacture of nitric acid: owing to its deliquescent\r\nproperty\r\nit will not serve for gunpowder. Formerly there were two exceedingly\r\nrich silver-mines in this neighbourhood, but their produce is now very\r\nsmall.\r\n\r\nOur arrival in the offing caused some little apprehension. Peru was in\r\na state of anarchy; and each party having demanded a contribution, the\r\npoor town of Iquique was in tribulation, thinking the evil hour was\r\ncome. The people had also their domestic troubles; a short time before,\r\nthree French carpenters had broken open, during the same night, the two\r\nchurches, and stolen all the plate: one of the robbers, however,\r\nsubsequently confessed, and the plate was recovered. The convicts were\r\nsent to Arequipa, which, though the capital of this province, is two\r\nhundred leagues distant; the government there thought it a pity to\r\npunish such useful workmen who could make all sorts of furniture; and\r\naccordingly liberated them. Things being in this state, the churches\r\nwere again broken open, but this time the plate was not recovered. The\r\ninhabitants became dreadfully enraged, and declaring that none but\r\nheretics would thus “eat God Almighty,” proceeded to torture some\r\nEnglishmen, with the intention of afterwards shooting them. At last the\r\nauthorities interfered, and peace was established.\r\n\r\n13_th._—In the morning I started for the saltpetre-works, a distance of\r\nfourteen leagues. Having ascended the steep coast-mountains by a zigzag\r\nsandy track, we soon came in view of the mines of Guantajaya and St.\r\nRosa. These two small villages are placed at the very mouths of the\r\nmines; and being perched up on hills, they had a still more unnatural\r\nand desolate appearance than the town of Iquique. We did not reach the\r\nsaltpetre works till after sunset, having ridden all day across an\r\nundulating country, a complete and utter desert. The road was strewed\r\nwith the bones and dried skins of many beasts of burden which had\r\nperished on it from fatigue. Excepting the Vultur aura, which preys on\r\nthe carcasses, I saw neither bird, quadruped, reptile, nor insect. On\r\nthe coast-mountains, at the height of about 2000 feet, where during\r\nthis season the clouds generally hang, a very few cacti were growing in\r\nthe clefts of rock; and the loose sand was strewed over with a lichen,\r\nwhich lies on the surface quite unattached. This plant belongs to the\r\ngenus Cladonia, and somewhat resembles the\r\nreindeer lichen. In some parts it was in sufficient quantity to tinge\r\nthe sand, as seen from a distance, of a pale yellowish colour. Farther\r\ninland, during the whole ride of fourteen leagues, I saw only one other\r\nvegetable production, and that was a most minute yellow lichen, growing\r\non the bones of the dead mules. This was the first true desert which I\r\nhad seen: the effect on me was not impressive; but I believe this was\r\nowing to my having become gradually accustomed to such scenes, as I\r\nrode northward from Valparaiso, through Coquimbo, to Copiapó. The\r\nappearance of the country was remarkable, from being covered by a thick\r\ncrust of common salt, and of a stratified saliferous alluvium, which\r\nseems to have been deposited as the land slowly rose above the level of\r\nthe sea. The salt is white, very hard, and compact: it occurs in\r\nwater-worn nodules projecting from the agglutinated sand, and is\r\nassociated with much gypsum. The appearance of this superficial mass\r\nvery closely resembled that of a country after snow, before the last\r\ndirty patches are thawed. The existence of this crust of a soluble\r\nsubstance over the whole face of the country shows how extraordinarily\r\ndry the climate must have been for a long period.\r\n\r\nAt night I slept at the house of the owner of one of the saltpetre\r\nmines. The country is here as unproductive as near the coast; but\r\nwater, having rather a bitter and brackish taste, can be procured by\r\ndigging wells. The well at this house was thirty-six yards deep: as\r\nscarcely any rain falls, it is evident the water is not thus derived;\r\nindeed if it were, it could not fail to be as salt as brine, for the\r\nwhole surrounding country is incrusted with various saline substances.\r\nWe must therefore conclude that it percolates under ground from the\r\nCordillera, though distant many leagues. In that direction there are a\r\nfew small villages, where the inhabitants, having more water, are\r\nenabled to irrigate a little land, and raise hay, on which the mules\r\nand asses, employed in carrying the saltpetre, are fed. The nitrate of\r\nsoda was now selling at the ship’s side at fourteen shillings per\r\nhundred pounds: the chief expense is its transport to the sea-coast.\r\nThe mine consists of a hard stratum, between two and three feet thick,\r\nof the nitrate mingled with a little of the sulphate of soda and a good\r\ndeal of common salt. It lies close beneath the surface, and follows for\r\na length of\r\none hundred and fifty miles the margin of a grand basin or plain; this,\r\nfrom its outline, manifestly must once have been a lake, or more\r\nprobably an inland arm of the sea, as may be inferred from the presence\r\nof iodic salts in the saline stratum. The surface of the plain is 3300\r\nfeet above the Pacific.\r\n\r\n\r\n19_th._—We anchored in the Bay of Callao, the seaport of Lima, the\r\ncapital of Peru. We stayed here six weeks, but from the troubled state\r\nof public affairs I saw very little of the country. During our whole\r\nvisit the climate was far from being so delightful as it is generally\r\nrepresented. A dull heavy bank of clouds constantly hung over the land,\r\nso that during the first sixteen days I had only one view of the\r\nCordillera behind Lima. These mountains, seen in stages, one above the\r\nother, through openings in the clouds, had a very grand appearance. It\r\nis almost become a proverb, that rain never falls in the lower part of\r\nPeru. Yet this can hardly be considered correct; for during almost\r\nevery day of our visit there was a thick drizzling mist, which was\r\nsufficient to make the streets muddy and one’s clothes damp: this the\r\npeople are pleased to call Peruvian dew. That much rain does not fall\r\nis very certain, for the houses are covered only with flat roofs made\r\nof hardened mud; and on the mole ship-loads of wheat were piled up,\r\nbeing thus left for weeks together without any shelter.\r\n\r\nI cannot say I liked the very little I saw of Peru: in summer, however,\r\nit is said that the climate is much pleasanter. In all seasons, both\r\ninhabitants and foreigners suffer from severe attacks of ague. This\r\ndisease is common on the whole coast of Peru, but is unknown in the\r\ninterior. The attacks of illness which arise from miasma never fail to\r\nappear most mysterious. So difficult is it to judge from the aspect of\r\na country, whether or not it is healthy, that if a person had been told\r\nto choose within the tropics a situation appearing favourable for\r\nhealth, very probably he would have named this coast. The plain round\r\nthe outskirts of Callao is sparingly covered with a coarse grass, and\r\nin some parts there are a few stagnant, though very small, pools of\r\nwater. The miasma, in all probability, arises from these: for the town\r\nof Arica was similarly circumstanced, and its healthiness was much\r\nimproved\r\nby the drainage of some little pools. Miasma is not always produced by\r\na luxuriant vegetation with an ardent climate; for many parts of\r\nBrazil, even where there are marshes and a rank vegetation, are much\r\nmore healthy than this sterile coast of Peru. The densest forests in a\r\ntemperate climate, as in Chiloe, do not seem in the slightest degree to\r\naffect the healthy condition of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe island of St. Jago, at the Cape de Verds, offers another\r\nstrongly-marked instance of a country, which any one would have\r\nexpected to find most healthy, being very much the contrary. I have\r\ndescribed the bare and open plains as supporting, during a few weeks\r\nafter the rainy season, a thin vegetation, which directly withers away\r\nand dries up: at this period the air appears to become quite poisonous;\r\nboth natives and foreigners often being affected with violent fevers.\r\nOn the other hand, the Galapagos Archipelago, in the Pacific, with a\r\nsimilar soil, and periodically subject to the same process of\r\nvegetation, is perfectly healthy. Humboldt has observed that “under the\r\ntorrid zone, the smallest marshes are the most dangerous, being\r\nsurrounded, as at Vera Cruz and Carthagena, with an arid and sandy\r\nsoil, which raises the temperature of the ambient air.”[5] On the coast\r\nof Peru, however, the temperature is not hot to any excessive degree;\r\nand perhaps in consequence the intermittent fevers are not of the most\r\nmalignant order. In all unhealthy countries the greatest risk is run by\r\nsleeping on shore. Is this owing to the state of the body during sleep,\r\nor to a greater abundance of miasma at such times? It appears certain\r\nthat those who stay on board a vessel, though anchored at only a short\r\ndistance from the coast, generally suffer less than those actually on\r\nshore. On the other hand, I have heard of one remarkable case where a\r\nfever broke out among the crew of a man-of-war some hundred miles off\r\nthe coast of Africa, and at the same time one of those fearful\r\nperiods[6] of death commenced at Sierra Leone.\r\n\r\n [5] _Political Essay on the Kingdom of New Spain,_ vol. iv, p. 199.\r\n\r\n\r\n [6] A similar interesting case is recorded in the _Madras Medical\r\n Quart. Journ._ 1839, p. 340. Dr. Ferguson in his admirable Paper (see\r\n 9th vol. of _Edinburgh Royal Trans._), shows clearly that the poison\r\n is generated in the drying process; and hence that dry hot countries\r\n are often the most unhealthy.\r\n\r\nNo state in South America, since the declaration of\r\nindependence, has suffered more from anarchy than Peru. At the time of\r\nour visit there were four chiefs in arms contending for supremacy in\r\nthe government: if one succeeded in becoming for a time very powerful,\r\nthe others coalesced against him; but no sooner were they victorious\r\nthan they were again hostile to each other. The other day, at the\r\nAnniversary of the Independence, high mass was performed, the President\r\npartaking of the sacrament: during the _Te Deum laudamus,_ instead of\r\neach regiment displaying the Peruvian flag, a black one with death’s\r\nhead was unfurled. Imagine a government under which such a scene could\r\nbe ordered, on such an occasion, to be typical of their determination\r\nof fighting to death! This state of affairs happened at a time very\r\nunfortunately for me, as I was precluded from taking any excursions\r\nmuch beyond the limits of the town. The barren island of San Lorenzo,\r\nwhich forms the harbour, was nearly the only place where one could walk\r\nsecurely. The upper part, which is upwards of 1000 feet in height,\r\nduring this season of the year (winter), comes within the lower limit\r\nof the clouds; and in consequence an abundant cryptogamic vegetation\r\nand a few flowers cover the summit. On the hills near Lima, at a height\r\nbut little greater, the ground is carpeted with moss, and beds of\r\nbeautiful yellow lilies, called Amancaes. This indicates a very much\r\ngreater degree of humidity than at a corresponding height at Iquique.\r\nProceeding northward of Lima, the climate becomes damper, till on the\r\nbanks of the Guayaquil, nearly under the equator, we find the most\r\nluxuriant forests. The change, however, from the sterile coast of Peru\r\nto that fertile land is described as taking place rather abruptly in\r\nthe latitude of Cape Blanco, two degrees south of Guayaquil.\r\n\r\nCallao is a filthy, ill-built, small seaport. The inhabitants, both\r\nhere and at Lima, present every imaginable shade of mixture, between\r\nEuropean, Negro, and Indian blood. They appear a depraved, drunken set\r\nof people. The atmosphere is loaded with foul smells, and that peculiar\r\none, which may be perceived in almost every town within the tropics,\r\nwas here very strong. The fortress, which withstood Lord Cochrane’s\r\nlong siege, has an imposing appearance. But the President, during our\r\nstay, sold the brass guns, and proceeded to dismantle parts of it. The\r\nreason assigned was, that he had not an\r\nofficer to whom he could trust so important a charge. He himself had\r\ngood reason for thinking so, as he had obtained the presidentship by\r\nrebelling while in charge of this same fortress. After we left South\r\nAmerica, he paid the penalty in the usual manner, by being conquered,\r\ntaken prisoner, and shot.\r\n\r\nLima stands on a plain in a valley, formed during the gradual retreat\r\nof the sea. It is seven miles from Callao, and is elevated 500 feet\r\nabove it; but from the slope being very gradual, the road appears\r\nabsolutely level; so that when at Lima it is difficult to believe one\r\nhas ascended even one hundred feet: Humboldt has remarked on this\r\nsingularly deceptive case. Steep barren hills rise like islands from\r\nthe plain, which is divided, by straight mud-walls, into large green\r\nfields. In these scarcely a tree grows excepting a few willows, and an\r\noccasional clump of bananas and of oranges. The city of Lima is now in\r\na wretched state of decay: the streets are nearly unpaved; and heaps of\r\nfilth are piled up in all directions, where the black gallinazos, tame\r\nas poultry, pick up bits of carrion. The houses have generally an upper\r\nstory, built, on account of the earthquakes, of plastered woodwork; but\r\nsome of the old ones, which are now used by several families, are\r\nimmensely large, and would rival in suites of apartments the most\r\nmagnificent in any place. Lima, the City of the Kings, must formerly\r\nhave been a splendid town. The extraordinary number of churches gives\r\nit, even at the present day, a peculiar and striking character,\r\nespecially when viewed from a short distance.\r\n\r\nOne day I went out with some merchants to hunt in the immediate\r\nvicinity of the city. Our sport was very poor; but I had an opportunity\r\nof seeing the ruins of one of the ancient Indian villages, with its\r\nmound like a natural hill in the centre. The remains of houses,\r\nenclosures, irrigating streams, and burial mounds, scattered over this\r\nplain, cannot fail to give one a high idea of the condition and number\r\nof the ancient population. When their earthenware, woollen clothes,\r\nutensils of elegant forms cut out of the hardest rocks, tools of\r\ncopper, ornaments of precious stones, palaces, and hydraulic works, are\r\nconsidered, it is impossible not to respect the considerable advance\r\nmade by them in the arts of civilisation. The burial\r\nmounds, called Huacas, are really stupendous; although in some places\r\nthey appear to be natural hills encased and modelled.\r\n\r\nThere is also another and very different class of ruins which possesses\r\nsome interest, namely, those of old Callao, overwhelmed by the great\r\nearthquake of 1746, and its accompanying wave. The destruction must\r\nhave been more complete even than at Talcahuano. Quantities of shingle\r\nalmost conceal the foundations of the walls, and vast masses of\r\nbrickwork appear to have been whirled about like pebbles by the\r\nretiring waves. It has been stated that the land subsided during this\r\nmemorable shock: I could not discover any proof of this; yet it seems\r\nfar from improbable, for the form of the coast must certainly have\r\nundergone some change since the foundation of the old town; as no\r\npeople in their senses would willingly have chosen for their building\r\nplace the narrow spit of shingle on which the ruins now stand. Since\r\nour voyage, M. Tschudi has come to the conclusion, by the comparison of\r\nold and modern maps, that the coast both north and south of Lima has\r\ncertainly subsided.\r\n\r\nOn the island of San Lorenzo there are very satisfactory proofs of\r\nelevation within the recent period; this of course is not opposed to\r\nthe belief of a small sinking of the ground having subsequently taken\r\nplace. The side of this island fronting the Bay of Callao is worn into\r\nthree obscure terraces, the lower one of which is covered by a bed a\r\nmile in length, almost wholly composed of shells of eighteen species,\r\nnow living in the adjoining sea. The height of this bed is eighty-five\r\nfeet. Many of the shells are deeply corroded, and have a much older and\r\nmore decayed appearance than those at the height of 500 or 600 feet on\r\nthe coast of Chile. These shells are associated with much common salt,\r\na little sulphate of lime (both probably left by the evaporation of the\r\nspray, as the land slowly rose), together with sulphate of soda and\r\nmuriate of lime. They rest on fragments of the underlying sandstone,\r\nand are covered by a few inches thick of detritus. The shells higher up\r\non this terrace could be traced scaling off in flakes, and falling into\r\nan impalpable powder; and on an upper terrace, at the height of 170\r\nfeet, and likewise at some considerably higher points, I found a layer\r\nof saline powder of\r\nexactly similar appearance, and lying in the same relative position. I\r\nhave no doubt that this upper layer originally existed as a bed of\r\nshells, like that on the eighty-five-feet ledge; but it does not now\r\ncontain even a trace of organic structure. The powder has been analysed\r\nfor me by Mr. T. Reeks; it consists of sulphates and muriates both of\r\nlime and soda, with very little carbonate of lime. It is known that\r\ncommon salt and carbonate of lime left in a mass for some time together\r\npartly decompose each other; though this does not happen with small\r\nquantities in solution. As the half-decomposed shells in the lower\r\nparts are associated with much common salt, together with some of the\r\nsaline substances composing the upper saline layer, and as these shells\r\nare corroded and decayed in a remarkable manner, I strongly suspect\r\nthat this double decomposition has here taken place. The resultant\r\nsalts, however, ought to be carbonate of soda and muriate of lime, the\r\nlatter is present, but not the carbonate of soda. Hence I am led to\r\nimagine that by some unexplained means the carbonate of soda becomes\r\nchanged into the sulphate. It is obvious that the saline layer could\r\nnot have been preserved in any country in which abundant rain\r\noccasionally fell: on the other hand this very circumstance, which at\r\nfirst sight appears so highly favourable to the long preservation of\r\nexposed shells, has probably been the indirect means, through the\r\ncommon salt not having been washed away, of their decomposition and\r\nearly decay.\r\n\r\nI was much interested by finding on the terrace, at the height of\r\neighty-five feet, _embedded_ amidst the shells and much sea-drifted\r\nrubbish, some bits of cotton thread, plaited rush, and the head of a\r\nstalk of Indian corn: I compared these relics with similar ones taken\r\nout of the Huacas, or old Peruvian tombs, and found them identical in\r\nappearance. On the mainland in front of San Lorenzo, near Bellavista,\r\nthere is an extensive and level plain about a hundred feet high, of\r\nwhich the lower part is formed of alternating layers of sand and impure\r\nclay, together with some gravel, and the surface, to the depth of from\r\nthree to six feet, of a reddish loam, containing a few scattered\r\nsea-shells and numerous small fragments of coarse red earthenware, more\r\nabundant at certain spots than at others. At first I was inclined to\r\nbelieve that this superficial\r\nbed, from its wide extent and smoothness, must have been deposited\r\nbeneath the sea; but I afterwards found in one spot that it lay on an\r\nartificial floor of round stones. It seems, therefore, most probable\r\nthat at a period when the land stood at a lower level there was a plain\r\nvery similar to that now surrounding Callao, which, being protected by\r\na shingle beach, is raised but very little above the level of the sea.\r\nOn this plain, with its underlying red-clay beds, I imagine that the\r\nIndians manufactured their earthen vessels; and that, during some\r\nviolent earthquake, the sea broke over the beach, and converted the\r\nplain into a temporary lake, as happened round Callao in 1713 and 1746.\r\nThe water would then have deposited mud containing fragments of pottery\r\nfrom the kilns, more abundant at some spots than at others, and shells\r\nfrom the sea. This bed with fossil earthenware stands at about the same\r\nheight with the shells on the lower terrace of San Lorenzo, in which\r\nthe cotton-thread and other relics were embedded. Hence we may safely\r\nconclude that within the Indo-human period there has been an elevation,\r\nas before alluded to, of more than eighty-five feet; for some little\r\nelevation must have been lost by the coast having subsided since the\r\nold maps were engraved. At Valparaiso, although in the 220 years before\r\nour visit the elevation cannot have exceeded nineteen feet, yet\r\nsubsequently to 1817 there has been a rise, partly insensible and\r\npartly by a start during the shock of 1822, of ten or eleven feet. The\r\nantiquity of the Indo-human race here, judging by the eighty-five feet\r\nrise of the land since the relics were embedded, is the more\r\nremarkable, as on the coast of Patagonia, when the land stood about the\r\nsame number of feet lower, the Macrauchenia was a living beast; but as\r\nthe Patagonian coast is some way distant from the Cordillera, the\r\nrising there may have been slower than here. At Bahia Blanca the\r\nelevation has been only a few feet since the numerous gigantic\r\nquadrupeds were there entombed; and, according to the generally\r\nreceived opinion, when these extinct animals were living man did not\r\nexist. But the rising of that part of the coast of Patagonia is perhaps\r\nno way connected with the Cordillera, but rather with a line of old\r\nvolcanic rocks in Banda Oriental, so that it may have been infinitely\r\nslower than on the shores of Peru. All these\r\nspeculations, however, must be vague; for who will pretend to say that\r\nthere may not have been several periods of subsidence, intercalated\r\nbetween the movements of elevation? for we know that along the whole\r\ncoast of Patagonia there have certainly been many and long pauses in\r\nthe upward action of the elevatory forces.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Huacas, Peruvian pottery]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Testudo Abingdonii, Galapagos Islands]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVII\r\n\r\n\r\nGALAPAGOS ARCHIPELAGO\r\n\r\nThe whole group volcanic—Number of craters—Leafless bushes—Colony at\r\nCharles Island—James Island—Salt-lake in crater—Natural history of the\r\ngroup—Ornithology, curious finches—Reptiles—Great tortoises, habits\r\nof—Marine Lizard, feeds on Sea-weed—Terrestrial Lizard, burrowing\r\nhabits, herbivorous—Importance of reptiles in the Archipelago—Fish,\r\nshells, insects—Botany—American type of organisation—Differences in the\r\nspecies or races on different islands—Tameness of the birds—Fear of man\r\nan acquired instinct.\r\n\r\n_September_ 15_th._—This archipelago consists of ten principal islands,\r\nof which five exceed the others in size. They are situated under the\r\nEquator, and between five and six hundred miles westward of the coast\r\nof America. They are all formed of volcanic rocks; a few fragments of\r\ngranite curiously glazed and altered by the heat can hardly be\r\nconsidered as an\r\nexception. Some of the craters surmounting the larger islands are of\r\nimmense size, and they rise to a height of between three and four\r\nthousand feet. Their flanks are studded by innumerable smaller\r\norifices. I scarcely hesitate to affirm that there must be in the whole\r\narchipelago at least two thousand craters. These consist either of lava\r\nand scoriæ, or of finely-stratified, sandstone-like tuff. Most of the\r\nlatter are beautifully symmetrical; they owe their origin to eruptions\r\nof volcanic mud without any lava: it is a remarkable circumstance that\r\nevery one of the twenty-eight tuff-craters which were examined had\r\ntheir southern sides either much lower than the other sides, or quite\r\nbroken down and removed. As all these craters apparently have been\r\nformed when standing in the sea, and as the waves from the trade wind\r\nand the swell from the open Pacific here unite their forces on the\r\nsouthern coasts of all the islands, this singular uniformity in the\r\nbroken state of the craters, composed of the soft and yielding tuff, is\r\neasily explained.\r\n\r\nGalapagos Archipelago\r\n\r\nConsidering that these islands are placed directly under the equator,\r\nthe climate is far from being excessively hot; this seems chiefly\r\ncaused by the singularly low temperature of the\r\nsurrounding water, brought here by the great southern Polar current.\r\nExcepting during one short season very little rain falls, and even then\r\nit is irregular; but the clouds generally hang low. Hence, whilst the\r\nlower parts of the islands are very sterile, the upper parts, at a\r\nheight of a thousand feet and upwards, possess a damp climate and a\r\ntolerably luxuriant vegetation. This is especially the case on the\r\nwindward sides of the islands, which first receive and condense the\r\nmoisture from the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nIn the morning (17th) we landed on Chatham Island, which, like the\r\nothers, rises with a tame and rounded outline, broken here and there by\r\nscattered hillocks, the remains of former craters. Nothing could be\r\nless inviting than the first appearance. A broken field of black\r\nbasaltic lava, thrown into the most rugged waves, and crossed by great\r\nfissures, is everywhere covered by stunted, sunburnt brushwood, which\r\nshows little signs of life. The dry and parched surface, being heated\r\nby the noonday sun, gave to the air a close and sultry feeling, like\r\nthat from a stove: we fancied even that the bushes smelt unpleasantly.\r\nAlthough I diligently tried to collect as many plants as possible, I\r\nsucceeded in getting very few; and such wretched-looking little weeds\r\nwould have better become an arctic than an equatorial Flora. The\r\nbrushwood appears, from a short distance, as leafless as our trees\r\nduring winter; and it was some time before I discovered that not only\r\nalmost every plant was now in full leaf, but that the greater number\r\nwere in flower. The commonest bush is one of the Euphorbiaceæ: an\r\nacacia and a great odd-looking cactus are the only trees which afford\r\nany shade. After the season of heavy rains, the islands are said to\r\nappear for a short time partially green. The volcanic island of\r\nFernando Noronha, placed in many respects under nearly similar\r\nconditions, is the only other country where I have seen a vegetation at\r\nall like this of the Galapagos Islands.\r\n\r\nThe _Beagle_ sailed round Chatham Island, and anchored in several bays.\r\nOne night I slept on shore on a part of the island where black\r\ntruncated cones were extraordinarily numerous: from one small eminence\r\nI counted sixty of them, all surmounted by craters more or less\r\nperfect. The greater number consisted merely of a ring of red scoriæ or\r\nslags cemented together: and their height above the plain of lava\r\nwas not more than from fifty to a hundred feet: none had been very\r\nlately active. The entire surface of this part of the island seems to\r\nhave been permeated, like a sieve, by the subterranean vapours: here\r\nand there the lava, whilst soft, has been blown into great bubbles; and\r\nin other parts, the tops of caverns similarly formed have fallen in,\r\nleaving circular pits with steep sides. From the regular form of the\r\nmany craters, they gave to the country an artificial appearance, which\r\nvividly reminded me of those parts of Staffordshire where the great\r\niron-foundries are most numerous. The day was glowing hot, and the\r\nscrambling over the rough surface and through the intricate thickets\r\nwas very fatiguing; but I was well repaid by the strange Cyclopean\r\nscene. As I was walking along I met two large tortoises, each of which\r\nmust have weighed at least two hundred pounds: one was eating a piece\r\nof cactus, and as I approached, it stared at me and slowly walked away;\r\nthe other gave a deep hiss, and drew in its head. These huge reptiles,\r\nsurrounded by the black lava, the leafless shrubs, and large cacti,\r\nseemed to my fancy like some antediluvian animals. The few\r\ndull-coloured birds cared no more for me than they did for the great\r\ntortoises.\r\n\r\n23_rd._—The _Beagle_ proceeded to Charles Island. This archipelago has\r\nlong been frequented, first by the Bucaniers, and latterly by whalers,\r\nbut it is only within the last six years that a small colony has been\r\nestablished here. The inhabitants are between two and three hundred in\r\nnumber; they are nearly all people of colour, who have been banished\r\nfor political crimes from the Republic of the Equator, of which Quito\r\nis the capital. The settlement is placed about four and a half miles\r\ninland, and at a height probably of a thousand feet. In the first part\r\nof the road we passed through leafless thickets, as in Chatham Island.\r\nHigher up the woods gradually became greener; and as soon as we crossed\r\nthe ridge of the island we were cooled by a fine southerly breeze, and\r\nour sight refreshed by a green and thriving vegetation. In this upper\r\nregion coarse grasses and ferns abound; but there are no tree-ferns: I\r\nsaw nowhere any member of the Palm family, which is the more singular,\r\nas 360 miles northward, Cocos Island takes its name from the number of\r\ncocoa-nuts. The houses are irregularly scattered over a flat space of\r\nground,\r\nwhich is cultivated with sweet potatoes and bananas. It will not easily\r\nbe imagined how pleasant the sight of black mud was to us, after having\r\nbeen so long accustomed to the parched soil of Peru and Northern Chile.\r\nThe inhabitants, although complaining of poverty, obtain, without much\r\ntrouble, the means of subsistence. In the woods there are many wild\r\npigs and goats; but the staple article of animal food is supplied by\r\nthe tortoises. Their numbers have of course been greatly reduced in\r\nthis island, but the people yet count on two days’ hunting giving them\r\nfood for the rest of the week. It is said that formerly single vessels\r\nhave taken away as many as seven hundred, and that the ship’s company\r\nof a frigate some years since brought down in one day two hundred\r\ntortoises to the beach.\r\n\r\n_September_ 29_th._—We doubled the south-west extremity of Albemarle\r\nIsland, and the next day were nearly becalmed between it and Narborough\r\nIsland. Both are covered with immense deluges of black naked lava,\r\nwhich have flowed either over the rims of the great caldrons, like\r\npitch over the rim of a pot in which it has been boiled, or have burst\r\nforth from smaller orifices on the flanks; in their descent they have\r\nspread over miles of the sea-coast. On both of these islands eruptions\r\nare known to have taken place; and in Albemarle we saw a small jet of\r\nsmoke curling from the summit of one of the great craters. In the\r\nevening we anchored in Bank’s Cove, in Albemarle Island. The next\r\nmorning I went out walking. To the south of the broken tuff-crater, in\r\nwhich the _Beagle_ was anchored, there was another beautifully\r\nsymmetrical one of an elliptic form; its longer axis was a little less\r\nthan a mile, and its depth about 500 feet. At its bottom there was a\r\nshallow lake, in the middle of which a tiny crater formed an islet. The\r\nday was overpoweringly hot, and the lake looked clear and blue: I\r\nhurried down the cindery slope, and, choked with dust, eagerly tasted\r\nthe water—but, to my sorrow, I found it salt as brine.\r\n\r\nThe rocks on the coast abounded with great black lizards, between three\r\nand four feet long; and on the hills, an ugly yellowish-brown species\r\nwas equally common. We saw many of this latter kind, some clumsily\r\nrunning out of the way, and others shuffling into their burrows. I\r\nshall presently describe\r\nin more detail the habits of both these reptiles. The whole of this\r\nnorthern part of Albemarle Island is miserably sterile.\r\n\r\n_October_ 8_th._—We arrived at James Island: this island, as well as\r\nCharles Island, were long since thus named after our kings of the\r\nStuart line. Mr. Bynoe, myself, and our servants were left here for a\r\nweek, with provisions and a tent, whilst the _Beagle_ went for water.\r\nWe found here a party of Spaniards who had been sent from Charles\r\nIsland to dry fish and to salt tortoise-meat. About six miles inland\r\nand at the height of nearly 2000 feet, a hovel had been built in which\r\ntwo men lived, who were employed in catching tortoises, whilst the\r\nothers were fishing on the coast. I paid this party two visits, and\r\nslept there one night. As in the other islands, the lower region was\r\ncovered by nearly leafless bushes, but the trees were here of a larger\r\ngrowth than elsewhere, several being two feet and some even two feet\r\nnine inches in diameter. The upper region, being kept damp by the\r\nclouds, supports a green and flourishing vegetation. So damp was the\r\nground, that there were large beds of a coarse cyperus, in which great\r\nnumbers of a very small water-rail lived and bred. While staying in\r\nthis upper region, we lived entirely upon tortoise-meat: the\r\nbreast-plate roasted (as the Gauchos do carne con cuero), with the\r\nflesh on it, is very good; and the young tortoises make excellent soup;\r\nbut otherwise the meat to my taste is indifferent.\r\n\r\nOne day we accompanied a party of the Spaniards in their whale-boat to\r\na salina, or lake from which salt is procured. After landing we had a\r\nvery rough walk over a rugged field of recent lava, which has almost\r\nsurrounded a tuff-crater at the bottom of which the salt-lake lies. The\r\nwater is only three or four inches deep and rests on a layer of\r\nbeautifully crystallised, white salt. The lake is quite circular, and\r\nis fringed with a border of bright green succulent plants; the almost\r\nprecipitous walls of the crater are clothed with wood, so that the\r\nscene was altogether both picturesque and curious. A few years since\r\nthe sailors belonging to a sealing-vessel murdered their captain in\r\nthis quiet spot; and we saw his skull lying among the bushes.\r\n\r\nDuring the greater part of our stay of a week the sky was cloudless,\r\nand if the trade-wind failed for an hour the heat\r\nbecame very oppressive. On two days the thermometer within the tent\r\nstood for some hours at 93°; but in the open air, in the wind and sun,\r\nat only 85°. The sand was extremely hot; the thermometer placed in some\r\nof a brown colour immediately rose to 137°, and how much above that it\r\nwould have risen I do not know for it was not graduated any higher. The\r\nblack sand felt much hotter, so that even in thick boots it was quite\r\ndisagreeable to walk over it.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe natural history of these islands is eminently curious, and well\r\ndeserves attention. Most of the organic productions are aboriginal\r\ncreations found nowhere else; there is even a difference between the\r\ninhabitants of the different islands; yet all show a marked\r\nrelationship with those of America, though separated from that\r\ncontinent by an open space of ocean, between 500 and 600 miles in\r\nwidth. The archipelago is a little world within itself, or rather a\r\nsatellite attached to America, whence it has derived a few stray\r\ncolonists, and has received the general character of its indigenous\r\nproductions. Considering the small size of these islands, we feel the\r\nmore astonished at the number of their aboriginal beings, and at their\r\nconfined range. Seeing every height crowned with its crater, and the\r\nboundaries of most of the lava-streams still distinct, we are led to\r\nbelieve that within a period geologically recent the unbroken ocean was\r\nhere spread out. Hence, both in space and time, we seem to be brought\r\nsomewhat near to that great fact—that mystery of mysteries—the first\r\nappearance of new beings on this earth.\r\n\r\nOf terrestrial mammals there is only one which must be considered as\r\nindigenous, namely a mouse (Mus Galapagoensis) and this is confined, as\r\nfar as I could ascertain, to Chatham Island, the most easterly island\r\nof the group. It belongs, as I am informed by Mr. Waterhouse, to a\r\ndivision of the family of mice characteristic of America. At James\r\nIsland there is a rat sufficiently distinct from the common kind to\r\nhave been named and described by Mr. Waterhouse; but as it belongs to\r\nthe old-world division of the family, and as this island has been\r\nfrequented by ships for the last hundred and fifty years, I can hardly\r\ndoubt that this rat is merely a variety produced by the new and\r\npeculiar climate, food, and soil, to which it has\r\nbeen subjected. Although no one has a right to speculate without\r\ndistinct facts, yet even with respect to the Chatham Island mouse, it\r\nshould be borne in mind that it may possibly be an American species\r\nimported here; for I have seen, in a most unfrequented part of the\r\nPampas, a native mouse living in the roof of a newly built hovel, and\r\ntherefore its transportation in a vessel is not improbable: analogous\r\nfacts have been observed by Dr. Richardson in North America.\r\n\r\nOf land-birds I obtained twenty-six kinds, all peculiar to the group\r\nand found nowhere else, with the exception of one lark-like finch from\r\nNorth America (Dolichonyx oryzivorus) which ranges on that continent as\r\nfar north as 54°, and generally frequents marshes. The other\r\ntwenty-five birds consist, firstly, of a hawk, curiously intermediate\r\nin structure between a Buzzard and the American group of\r\ncarrion-feeding Polybori; and with these latter birds it agrees most\r\nclosely in every habit and even tone of voice. Secondly there are two\r\nowls, representing the short-eared and white barn-owls of Europe.\r\nThirdly a wren, three tyrant-flycatchers (two of them species of\r\nPyrocephalus, one or both of which would be ranked by some\r\nornithologists as only varieties), and a dove—all analogous to, but\r\ndistinct from, American species. Fourthly a swallow, which though\r\ndiffering from the Progne purpurea of both Americas, only in being\r\nrather duller coloured, smaller, and slenderer, is considered by Mr.\r\nGould as specifically distinct. Fifthly there are three species of\r\nmocking-thrush—a form highly characteristic of America. The remaining\r\nland-birds form a most singular group of finches, related to each other\r\nin the structure of their beaks, short tails, form of body and plumage:\r\nthere are thirteen species which Mr. Gould has divided into four\r\nsub-groups. All these species are peculiar to this archipelago; and so\r\nis the whole group, with the exception of one species of the sub-group\r\nCactornis, lately brought from Bow Island, in the Low Archipelago. Of\r\nCactornis the two species may be often seen climbing about the flowers\r\nof the great cactus-trees; but all the other species of this group of\r\nfinches, mingled together in flocks, feed on the dry and sterile ground\r\nof the lower districts. The males of all, or certainly of the greater\r\nnumber, are jet black; and the females (with perhaps one or two\r\nexceptions) are brown. The\r\nmost curious fact is the perfect gradation in the size of the beaks in\r\nthe different species of Geospiza, from one as large as that of a\r\nhawfinch to that of a chaffinch, and (if Mr. Gould is right in\r\nincluding his sub-group, Certhidea, in the main group) even to that of\r\na warbler. The largest beak in the genus Geospiza is shown above in\r\nFig. 1, and the smallest in Fig. 3; but instead of there being only one\r\nintermediate species, with a beak of the size shown in Fig. 2, there\r\nare no less than six species with insensibly graduated beaks. The beak\r\nof the sub-group Certhidea, is shown in Fig. 4. The beak of Cactornis\r\nis somewhat like that of a starling, and that of the fourth sub-group,\r\nCamarhynchus, is slightly parrot-shaped. Seeing this gradation and\r\ndiversity of structure in one small, intimately related group of birds,\r\none might really fancy that from an original paucity of birds in this\r\narchipelago, one species had been taken and modified for different\r\nends. In a like manner it might be fancied that a bird, originally a\r\nbuzzard, had been induced here to undertake the office of the\r\ncarrion-feeding Polybori of the American continent.\r\n\r\nFinches from Galapagos Archipelago\r\n\r\nOf waders and water-birds I was able to get only eleven kinds, and of\r\nthese only three (including a rail confined to the damp summits of the\r\nislands) are new species. Considering\r\nthe wandering habits of the gulls, I was surprised to find that the\r\nspecies inhabiting these islands is peculiar, but allied to one from\r\nthe southern parts of South America. The far greater peculiarity of the\r\nland-birds, namely, twenty-five out of twenty-six being new species, or\r\nat least new races, compared with the waders and web-footed birds, is\r\nin accordance with the greater range which these latter orders have in\r\nall parts of the world. We shall hereafter see this law of aquatic\r\nforms, whether marine or fresh water, being less peculiar at any given\r\npoint of the earth’s surface than the terrestrial forms of the same\r\nclasses, strikingly illustrated in the shells, and in a lesser degree\r\nin the insects of this archipelago.\r\n\r\nTwo of the waders are rather smaller than the same species brought from\r\nother places: the swallow is also smaller, though it is doubtful\r\nwhether or not it is distinct from its analogue. The two owls, the two\r\ntyrant-flycatchers (Pyrocephalus) and the dove, are also smaller than\r\nthe analogous but distinct species, to which they are most nearly\r\nrelated; on the other hand, the gull is rather larger. The two owls,\r\nthe swallow, all three species of mocking-thrush, the dove in its\r\nseparate colours though not in its whole plumage, the Totanus, and the\r\ngull, are likewise duskier coloured than their analogous species; and\r\nin the case of the mocking-thrush and Totanus, than any other species\r\nof the two genera. With the exception of a wren with a fine yellow\r\nbreast, and of a tyrant-flycatcher with a scarlet tuft and breast, none\r\nof the birds are brilliantly coloured, as might have been expected in\r\nan equatorial district. Hence it would appear probable that the same\r\ncauses which here make the immigrants of some species smaller, make\r\nmost of the peculiar Galapageian species also smaller, as well as very\r\ngenerally more dusky coloured. All the plants have a wretched, weedy\r\nappearance, and I did not see one beautiful flower. The insects, again,\r\nare small-sized and dull coloured, and, as Mr. Waterhouse informs me,\r\nthere is nothing in their general appearance which would have led him\r\nto imagine that they had come from under the equator.[1] The birds,\r\nplants,\r\nand insects have a desert character, and are not more brilliantly\r\ncoloured than those from southern Patagonia; we may, therefore,\r\nconclude that the usual gaudy colouring of the intertropical\r\nproductions is not related either to the heat or light of those zones,\r\nbut to some other cause, perhaps to the conditions of existence being\r\ngenerally favourable to life.\r\n\r\n [1] The progress of research has shown that some of these birds, which\r\n were then thought to be confined to the islands, occur on the American\r\n continent. The eminent ornithologist, Mr. Sclater, informs me that\r\n this is the case with the Strix punctatissima and Pyrocephalus nanus;\r\n and probably with the Otus galapagoensis and Zenaida galapagoensis: so\r\n that the number of endemic birds is reduced to twenty-three, or\r\n probably to twenty-one. Mr. Sclater thinks that one or two of these\r\n endemic forms should be ranked rather as varieties than species, which\r\n always seemed to me probable.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will now turn to the order of reptiles, which gives the most\r\nstriking character to the zoology of these islands. The species are not\r\nnumerous, but the numbers of individuals of each species are\r\nextraordinarily great. There is one small lizard belonging to a South\r\nAmerican genus, and two species (and probably more) of the\r\nAmblyrhynchus—a genus confined to the Galapagos Islands. There is one\r\nsnake which is numerous; it is identical, as I am informed by M.\r\nBibron, with the Psammophis Temminckii from Chile.[2] Of sea-turtle I\r\nbelieve there are more than one species, and of tortoises there are, as\r\nwe shall presently show, two or three species or races. Of toads and\r\nfrogs there are none: I was surprised at this, considering how well\r\nsuited for them the temperate and damp upper woods appeared to be. It\r\nrecalled to my mind the remark made by Bory St. Vincent,[3] namely,\r\nthat none of this family are found on any of the volcanic islands in\r\nthe great oceans. As far as I can ascertain from various works, this\r\nseems to hold good throughout the Pacific, and even in the large\r\nislands of the Sandwich archipelago. Mauritius offers an apparent\r\nexception, where I saw the Rana Mascariensis in abundance: this frog is\r\nsaid now to inhabit the Seychelles, Madagascar, and Bourbon; but on the\r\nother hand, Du Bois, in his voyage in 1669, states that there were no\r\nreptiles in Bourbon except tortoises; and the Officier du Roi asserts\r\nthat before 1768 it had been attempted, without success, to\r\nintroduce frogs into Mauritius—I presume for the purpose of eating:\r\nhence it may be well doubted whether this frog is an aboriginal of\r\nthese islands. The absence of the frog family in the oceanic islands is\r\nthe more remarkable, when contrasted with the case of lizards, which\r\nswarm on most of the smallest islands. May this difference not be\r\ncaused by the greater facility with which the eggs of lizards,\r\nprotected by calcareous shells, might be transported through\r\nsalt-water, than could the slimy spawn of frogs?\r\n\r\n [2] This is stated by Dr. Günther (_Zoolog. Soc._ Jan. 24th, 1859) to\r\n be a peculiar species, not known to inhabit any other country.\r\n\r\n\r\n [3] _Voyage aux Quatres Iles d’Afrique._ With respect to the Sandwich\r\n Islands see Tyerman and Bennett’s _Journal_, vol. i, p. 434. For\r\n Mauritius see _Voyage par un Officier,_ etc., Part i, p. 170. There\r\n are no frogs in the Canary Islands (Webb et Berthelot _Hist. Nat. des\r\n Iles Canaries._ I saw none at St. Jago in the Cape de Verds. There are\r\n none at St. Helena.\r\n\r\nI will first describe the habits of the tortoise (Testudo nigra,\r\nformerly called Indica), which has been so frequently alluded to. These\r\nanimals are found, I believe, on all the islands of the Archipelago;\r\ncertainly on the greater number. They frequent in preference the high\r\ndamp parts, but they likewise live in the lower and arid districts. I\r\nhave already shown, from the numbers which have been caught in a single\r\nday, how very numerous they must be. Some grow to an immense size: Mr.\r\nLawson, an Englishman, and vice-governor of the colony, told us that he\r\nhad seen several so large that it required six or eight men to lift\r\nthem from the ground; and that some had afforded as much as two hundred\r\npounds of meat. The old males are the largest, the females rarely\r\ngrowing to so great a size: the male can readily be distinguished from\r\nthe female by the greater length of its tail. The tortoises which live\r\non those islands where there is no water, or in the lower and arid\r\nparts of the others, feed chiefly on the succulent cactus. Those which\r\nfrequent the higher and damp regions eat the leaves of various trees, a\r\nkind of berry (called guayavita) which is acid and austere, and\r\nlikewise a pale green filamentous lichen (Usnera plicata), that hangs\r\nfrom the boughs of the trees.\r\n\r\nThe tortoise is very fond of water, drinking large quantities, and\r\nwallowing in the mud. The larger islands alone possess springs, and\r\nthese are always situated towards the central parts, and at a\r\nconsiderable height. The tortoises, therefore, which frequent the lower\r\ndistricts, when thirsty, are obliged to travel from a long distance.\r\nHence broad and well-beaten paths branch off in every direction from\r\nthe wells down to the sea-coast; and the Spaniards, by following them\r\nup, first discovered the watering-places. When I landed at Chatham\r\nIsland, I could not imagine what animal travelled so methodically along\r\nwell-chosen tracks. Near the springs it was a curious spectacle to\r\nbehold many of these huge creatures, one set eagerly travelling onwards\r\nwith outstretched necks, and another set returning, after having drunk\r\ntheir fill. When the tortoise arrives at the spring, quite regardless\r\nof any spectator, he buries his head in the water above his eyes, and\r\ngreedily swallows great mouthfuls, at the rate of about ten in a\r\nminute. The inhabitants say each animal stays three or four days in the\r\nneighbourhood of the water, and then returns to the lower country; but\r\nthey differed respecting the frequency of these visits. The animal\r\nprobably regulates them according to the nature of the food on which it\r\nhas lived. It is, however, certain that tortoises can subsist even on\r\nthose islands where there is no other water than what falls during a\r\nfew rainy days in the year.\r\n\r\nI believe it is well ascertained that the bladder of the frog acts as a\r\nreservoir for the moisture necessary to its existence: such seems to be\r\nthe case with the tortoise. For some time after a visit to the springs,\r\ntheir urinary bladders are distended with fluid, which is said\r\ngradually to decrease in volume, and to become less pure. The\r\ninhabitants, when walking in the lower district, and overcome with\r\nthirst, often take advantage of this circumstance, and drink the\r\ncontents of the bladder if full: in one I saw killed, the fluid was\r\nquite limpid, and had only a very slightly bitter taste. The\r\ninhabitants, however, always first drink the water in the pericardium,\r\nwhich is described as being best.\r\n\r\nThe tortoises, when purposely moving towards any point, travel by night\r\nand day and arrive at their journey’s end much sooner than would be\r\nexpected. The inhabitants, from observing marked individuals, consider\r\nthat they travel a distance of about eight miles in two or three days.\r\nOne large tortoise, which I watched, walked at the rate of sixty yards\r\nin ten minutes, that is 360 yards in the hour, or four miles a\r\nday,—allowing a little time for it to eat on the road. During the\r\nbreeding season, when the male and female are together, the male utters\r\na hoarse roar or bellowing, which, it is said, can be heard at the\r\ndistance of more than a hundred yards. The female never uses her voice,\r\nand the male only at these times; so that when the people hear this\r\nnoise, they know that the two are\r\ntogether. They were at this time (October) laying their eggs. The\r\nfemale, where the soil is sandy, deposits them together, and covers\r\nthem up with sand; but where the ground is rocky she drops them\r\nindiscriminately in any hole: Mr. Bynoe found seven placed in a\r\nfissure. The egg is white and spherical; one which I measured was seven\r\ninches and three-eighths in circumference, and therefore larger than a\r\nhen’s egg. The young tortoises, as soon as they are hatched, fall a\r\nprey in great numbers to the carrion-feeding buzzard. The old ones seem\r\ngenerally to die from accidents, as from falling down precipices: at\r\nleast, several of the inhabitants told me that they never found one\r\ndead without some evident cause.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants believe that these animals are absolutely deaf;\r\ncertainly they do not overhear a person walking close behind them. I\r\nwas always amused when overtaking one of these great monsters, as it\r\nwas quietly pacing along, to see how suddenly, the instant I passed, it\r\nwould draw in its head and legs, and uttering a deep hiss fall to the\r\nground with a heavy sound, as if struck dead. I frequently got on their\r\nbacks, and then giving a few raps on the hinder part of their shells,\r\nthey would rise up and walk away;—but I found it very difficult to keep\r\nmy balance. The flesh of this animal is largely employed, both fresh\r\nand salted; and a beautifully clear oil is prepared from the fat. When\r\na tortoise is caught, the man makes a slit in the skin near its tail,\r\nso as to see inside its body, whether the fat under the dorsal plate is\r\nthick. If it is not, the animal is liberated; and it is said to recover\r\nsoon from this strange operation. In order to secure the tortoises, it\r\nis not sufficient to turn them like turtle, for they are often able to\r\nget on their legs again.\r\n\r\nThere can be little doubt that this tortoise is an aboriginal\r\ninhabitant of the Galapagos; for it is found on all, or nearly all, the\r\nislands, even on some of the smaller ones where there is no water; had\r\nit been an imported species this would hardly have been the case in a\r\ngroup which has been so little frequented. Moreover, the old Bucaniers\r\nfound this tortoise in greater numbers even than at present: Wood and\r\nRogers also, in 1708, say that it is the opinion of the Spaniards that\r\nit is found nowhere else in this quarter of the world. It is now widely\r\ndistributed; but it may be questioned whether it is in\r\nany other place an aboriginal. The bones of a tortoise at Mauritius,\r\nassociated with those of the extinct Dodo, have generally been\r\nconsidered as belonging to this tortoise; if this had been so,\r\nundoubtedly it must have been there indigenous; but M. Bibron informs\r\nme that he believes that it was distinct, as the species now living\r\nthere certainly is.\r\n\r\nAmblyrhynchus Cristatus\r\n\r\nThe Amblyrhynchus, a remarkable genus of lizards, is confined to this\r\narchipelago; there are two species, resembling each other in general\r\nform, one being terrestrial and the other aquatic. This latter species\r\n(A. cristatus) was first characterised by Mr. Bell, who well foresaw,\r\nfrom its short, broad head, and strong claws of equal length, that its\r\nhabits of life would turn out very peculiar, and different from those\r\nof its nearest ally, the Iguana. It is extremely common on all the\r\nislands throughout the group, and lives exclusively on the rocky\r\nsea-beaches, being never found, at least I never saw one, even ten\r\nyards in-shore. It is a hideous-looking creature, of a dirty black\r\ncolour, stupid, and sluggish in its movements. The usual length of a\r\nfull-grown one is about a yard, but there are some even four feet long;\r\na large one weighed twenty pounds: on the island of Albemarle they seem\r\nto grow to a greater size than elsewhere. Their tails are flattened\r\nsideways, and all four feet partially webbed. They are occasionally\r\nseen some hundred yards from the shore, swimming about; and Captain\r\nCollnett, in his Voyage says, “They go to sea in herds a-fishing, and\r\nsun themselves on the rocks; and may be called alligators in\r\nminiature.” It must not, however, be supposed that they live on fish.\r\nWhen in the water this lizard swims with perfect ease and quickness, by\r\na serpentine movement of\r\nits body and flattened tail—the legs being motionless and closely\r\ncollapsed on its sides. A seaman on board sank one, with a heavy weight\r\nattached to it, thinking thus to kill it directly; but when, an hour\r\nafterwards, he drew up the line, it was quite active. Their limbs and\r\nstrong claws are admirably adapted for crawling over the rugged and\r\nfissured masses of lava which everywhere form the coast. In such\r\nsituations a group of six or seven of these hideous reptiles may\r\noftentimes be seen on the black rocks, a few feet above the surf,\r\nbasking in the sun with outstretched legs.\r\n\r\nI opened the stomachs of several, and found them largely distended with\r\nminced sea-weed (Ulvæ), which grows in thin foliaceous expansions of a\r\nbright green or a dull red colour. I do not recollect having observed\r\nthis sea-weed in any quantity on the tidal rocks; and I have reason to\r\nbelieve it grows at the bottom of the sea, at some little distance from\r\nthe coast. If such be the case, the object of these animals\r\noccasionally going out to sea is explained. The stomach contained\r\nnothing but the sea-weed. Mr. Bynoe, however, found a piece of a crab\r\nin one; but this might have got in accidentally, in the same manner as\r\nI have seen a caterpillar, in the midst of some lichen, in the paunch\r\nof a tortoise. The intestines were large, as in other herbivorous\r\nanimals. The nature of this lizard’s food, as well as the structure of\r\nits tail and feet, and the fact of its having been seen voluntarily\r\nswimming out at sea, absolutely prove its aquatic habits; yet there is\r\nin this respect one strange anomaly, namely, that when frightened it\r\nwill not enter the water. Hence it is easy to drive these lizards down\r\nto any little point overhanging the sea, where they will sooner allow a\r\nperson to catch hold of their tails than jump into the water. They do\r\nnot seem to have any notion of biting; but when much frightened they\r\nsquirt a drop of fluid from each nostril. I threw one several times as\r\nfar as I could, into a deep pool left by the retiring tide; but it\r\ninvariably returned in a direct line to the spot where I stood. It swam\r\nnear the bottom, with a very graceful and rapid movement, and\r\noccasionally aided itself over the uneven ground with its feet. As soon\r\nas it arrived near the edge, but still being under water, it tried to\r\nconceal itself in the tufts of sea-weed, or it entered some crevice. As\r\nsoon as it thought\r\nthe danger was past, it crawled out on the dry rocks, and shuffled away\r\nas quickly as it could. I several times caught this same lizard, by\r\ndriving it down to a point, and though possessed of such perfect powers\r\nof diving and swimming, nothing would induce it to enter the water; and\r\nas often as I threw it in, it returned in the manner above described.\r\nPerhaps this singular piece of apparent stupidity may be accounted for\r\nby the circumstance that this reptile has no enemy whatever on shore,\r\nwhereas at sea it must often fall a prey to the numerous sharks. Hence,\r\nprobably, urged by a fixed and hereditary instinct that the shore is\r\nits place of safety, whatever the emergency may be, it there takes\r\nrefuge.\r\n\r\nDuring our visit (in October) I saw extremely few small individuals of\r\nthis species, and none I should think under a year old. From this\r\ncircumstance it seems probable that the breeding season had not then\r\ncommenced. I asked several of the inhabitants if they knew where it\r\nlaid its eggs: they said that they knew nothing of its propagation,\r\nalthough well acquainted with the eggs of the land kind—a fact,\r\nconsidering how very common this lizard is, not a little extraordinary.\r\n\r\nWe will now turn to the terrestrial species (A. Demarlii), with a round\r\ntail, and toes without webs. This lizard, instead of being found like\r\nthe other on all the islands, is confined to the central part of the\r\narchipelago, namely to Albemarle, James, Barrington, and Indefatigable\r\nislands. To the southward, in Charles, Hood, and Chatham Islands, and\r\nto the northward, in Towers, Bindloes, and Abingdon, I neither saw nor\r\nheard of any. It would appear as if it had been created in the centre\r\nof the archipelago, and thence had been dispersed only to a certain\r\ndistance. Some of these lizards inhabit the high and damp parts of the\r\nislands, but they are much more numerous in the lower and sterile\r\ndistricts near the coast. I cannot give a more forcible proof of their\r\nnumbers, than by stating that when we were left at James Island, we\r\ncould not for some time find a spot free from their burrows on which to\r\npitch our single tent. Like their brothers the sea-kind, they are ugly\r\nanimals, of a yellowish orange beneath, and of a brownish-red colour\r\nabove: from their low facial angle they have a singularly stupid\r\nappearance. They are, perhaps, of a rather less size than the marine\r\nspecies; but several of them\r\nweighed between ten and fifteen pounds. In their movements they are\r\nlazy and half torpid. When not frightened, they slowly crawl along with\r\ntheir tails and bellies dragging on the ground. They often stop, and\r\ndoze for a minute or two, with closed eyes and hind legs spread out on\r\nthe parched soil.\r\n\r\nThey inhabit burrows which they sometimes make between fragments of\r\nlava, but more generally on level patches of the soft sandstone-like\r\ntuff. The holes do not appear to be very deep, and they enter the\r\nground at a small angle; so that when walking over these\r\nlizard-warrens, the soil is constantly giving way, much to the\r\nannoyance of the tired walker. This animal, when making its burrow,\r\nworks alternately the opposite sides of its body. One front leg for a\r\nshort time scratches up the soil, and throws it towards the hind foot,\r\nwhich is well placed so as to heave it beyond the mouth of the hole.\r\nThat side of the body being tired, the other takes up the task, and so\r\non alternately. I watched one for a long time, till half its body was\r\nburied; I then walked up and pulled it by the tail; at this it was\r\ngreatly astonished, and soon shuffled up to see what was the matter;\r\nand then stared me in the face, as much as to say, “What made you pull\r\nmy tail?”\r\n\r\nThey feed by day, and do not wander far from their burrows; if\r\nfrightened, they rush to them with a most awkward gait. Except when\r\nrunning down hill, they cannot move very fast, apparently from the\r\nlateral position of their legs. They are not at all timorous: when\r\nattentively watching any one, they curl their tails, and, raising\r\nthemselves on their front legs, nod their heads vertically, with a\r\nquick movement, and try to look very fierce; but in reality they are\r\nnot at all so: if one just stamps on the ground, down go their tails,\r\nand off they shuffle as quickly as they can. I have frequently observed\r\nsmall fly-eating lizards, when watching anything, nod their heads in\r\nprecisely the same manner; but I do not at all know for what purpose.\r\nIf this Amblyrhynchus is held and plagued with a stick, it will bite it\r\nvery severely; but I caught many by the tail, and they never tried to\r\nbite me. If two are placed on the ground and held together, they will\r\nfight, and bite each other till blood is drawn.\r\n\r\nThe individuals, and they are the greater number, which inhabit the\r\nlower country, can scarcely taste a drop of water\r\nthroughout the year; but they consume much of the succulent cactus, the\r\nbranches of which are occasionally broken off by the wind. I several\r\ntimes threw a piece to two or three of them when together; and it was\r\namusing enough to see them trying to seize and carry it away in their\r\nmouths, like so many hungry dogs with a bone. They eat very\r\ndeliberately, but do not chew their food. The little birds are aware\r\nhow harmless these creatures are: I have seen one of the thick-billed\r\nfinches picking at one end of a piece of cactus (which is much relished\r\nby all the animals of the lower region), whilst a lizard was eating at\r\nthe other end; and afterwards the little bird with the utmost\r\nindifference hopped on the back of the reptile.\r\n\r\nI opened the stomachs of several, and found them full of vegetable\r\nfibres and leaves of different trees, especially of an acacia. In the\r\nupper region they live chiefly on the acid and astringent berries of\r\nthe guayavita, under which trees I have seen these lizards and the huge\r\ntortoises feeding together. To obtain the acacia-leaves they crawl up\r\nthe low stunted trees; and it is not uncommon to see a pair quietly\r\nbrowsing, whilst seated on a branch several feet above the ground.\r\nThese lizards, when cooked, yield a white meat, which is liked by those\r\nwhose stomachs soar above all prejudices. Humboldt has remarked that in\r\nintertropical South America all lizards which inhabit dry regions are\r\nesteemed delicacies for the table. The inhabitants state that those\r\nwhich inhabit the upper damp parts drink water, but that the others do\r\nnot, like the tortoises, travel up for it from the lower sterile\r\ncountry. At the time of our visit, the females had within their bodies\r\nnumerous, large, elongated eggs, which they lay in their burrows: the\r\ninhabitants seek them for food.\r\n\r\nThese two species of Amblyrhynchus agree, as I have already stated, in\r\ntheir general structure, and in many of their habits. Neither have that\r\nrapid movement, so characteristic of the genera Lacerta and Iguana.\r\nThey are both herbivorous, although the kind of vegetation on which\r\nthey feed is so very different. Mr. Bell has given the name to the\r\ngenus from the shortness of the snout: indeed, the form of the mouth\r\nmay almost be compared to that of the tortoise: one is led to suppose\r\nthat this is an adaptation to their herbivorous appetites. It is very\r\ninteresting thus to find a well-characterised genus,\r\nhaving its marine and terrestrial species, belonging to so confined a\r\nportion of the world. The aquatic species is by far the most\r\nremarkable, because it is the only existing lizard which lives on\r\nmarine vegetable productions. As I at first observed, these islands are\r\nnot so remarkable for the number of the species of reptiles, as for\r\nthat of the individuals, when we remember the well-beaten paths made by\r\nthe thousands of huge tortoises—the many turtles—the great warrens of\r\nthe terrestrial Amblyrhynchus—and the groups of the marine species\r\nbasking on the coast-rocks of every island—we must admit that there is\r\nno other quarter of the world where this Order replaces the herbivorous\r\nmammalia in so extraordinary a manner. The geologist on hearing this\r\nwill probably refer back in his mind to the Secondary epochs, when\r\nlizards, some herbivorous, some carnivorous, and of dimensions\r\ncomparable only with our existing whales, swarmed on the land and in\r\nthe sea. It is, therefore, worthy of his observation that this\r\narchipelago, instead of possessing a humid climate and rank vegetation,\r\ncannot be considered otherwise than extremely arid, and, for an\r\nequatorial region, remarkably temperate.\r\n\r\nTo finish with the zoology: the fifteen kinds of sea-fish which I\r\nprocured here are all new species; they belong to twelve genera, all\r\nwidely distributed, with the exception of Prionotus, of which the four\r\npreviously known species live on the eastern side of America. Of\r\nland-shells I collected sixteen kinds (and two marked varieties) of\r\nwhich, with the exception of one Helix found at Tahiti, all are\r\npeculiar to this archipelago: a single fresh-water shell (Paludina) is\r\ncommon to Tahiti and Van Diemen’s Land. Mr. Cuming, before our voyage,\r\nprocured here ninety species of sea-shells, and this does not include\r\nseveral species not yet specifically examined, of Trochus, Turbo,\r\nMonodonta, and Nassa. He has been kind enough to give me the following\r\ninteresting results: of the ninety shells, no less than forty-seven are\r\nunknown elsewhere—a wonderful fact, considering how widely distributed\r\nsea-shells generally are. Of the forty-three shells found in other\r\nparts of the world, twenty-five inhabit the western coast of America,\r\nand of these eight are distinguishable as varieties; the remaining\r\neighteen (including one variety) were found by Mr. Cuming in the Low\r\nArchipelago, and some of them also at the Philippines. This fact of\r\nshells\r\nfrom islands in the central parts of the Pacific occurring here,\r\ndeserves notice, for not one single sea-shell is known to be common to\r\nthe islands of that ocean and to the west coast of America. The space\r\nof open sea running north and south off the west coast separates two\r\nquite distinct conchological provinces; but at the Galapagos\r\nArchipelago we have a halting-place, where many new forms have been\r\ncreated, and whither these two great conchological provinces have each\r\nsent several colonists. The American province has also sent here\r\nrepresentative species; for there is a Galapageian species of\r\nMonoceros, a genus only found on the west coast of America; and there\r\nare Galapageian species of Fissurella and Cancellaria, genera common on\r\nthe west coast, but not found (as I am informed by Mr. Cuming) in the\r\ncentral islands of the Pacific. On the other hand, there are\r\nGalapageian species of Oniscia and Stylifer, genera common to the West\r\nIndies and to the Chinese and Indian seas, but not found either on the\r\nwest coast of America or in the central Pacific. I may here add, that\r\nafter the comparison by Messrs. Cuming and Hinds of about 2000 shells\r\nfrom the eastern and western coasts of America, only one single shell\r\nwas found in common, namely, the Purpura patula, which inhabits the\r\nWest Indies, the coast of Panama, and the Galapagos. We have,\r\ntherefore, in this quarter of the world, three great conchological\r\nsea-provinces, quite distinct, though surprisingly near each other,\r\nbeing separated by long north and south spaces either of land or of\r\nopen sea.\r\n\r\nI took great pains in collecting the insects, but excepting Tierra del\r\nFuego, I never saw in this respect so poor a country. Even in the upper\r\nand damp region I procured very few, excepting some minute Diptera and\r\nHymenoptera, mostly of common mundane forms. As before remarked, the\r\ninsects, for a tropical region, are of very small size and dull\r\ncolours. Of beetles I collected twenty-five species (excluding a\r\nDermestes and Corynetes imported wherever a ship touches); of these,\r\ntwo belong to the Harpalidæ, two to the Hydrophilidæ, nine to three\r\nfamilies of the Heteromera, and the remaining twelve to as many\r\ndifferent families. This circumstance of insects (and I may add\r\nplants), where few in number, belonging to many different families, is,\r\nI believe, very general. Mr. Waterhouse, who has published[4]\r\nan account of the insects of this archipelago, and to whom I am\r\nindebted for the above details, informs me that there are several new\r\ngenera; and that of the genera not new, one or two are American, and\r\nthe rest of mundane distribution. With the exception of a wood-feeding\r\nApate, and of one or probably two water-beetles from the American\r\ncontinent, all the species appear to be new.\r\n\r\n [4] _Ann. and Mag. of Nat. Hist.,_ vol. xvi, p. 19.\r\n\r\nThe botany of this group is fully as interesting as the zoology. Dr. J.\r\nHooker will soon publish in the “Linnean Transactions” a full account\r\nof the Flora, and I am much indebted to him for the following details.\r\nOf flowering plants there are, as far as at present is known, 185\r\nspecies, and 40 cryptogamic species, making together 225; of this\r\nnumber I was fortunate enough to bring home 193. Of the flowering\r\nplants, 100 are new species, and are probably confined to this\r\narchipelago. Dr. Hooker conceives that, of the plants not so confined,\r\nat least 10 species found near the cultivated ground at Charles Island\r\nhave been imported. It is, I think, surprising that more American\r\nspecies have not been introduced naturally, considering that the\r\ndistance is only between 500 and 600 miles from the continent, and that\r\n(according to Collnet, page 58) drift-wood, bamboos, canes, and the\r\nnuts of a palm, are often washed on the south-eastern shores. The\r\nproportion of 100 flowering plants out of 185 (or 175 excluding the\r\nimported weeds) being new, is sufficient, I conceive, to make the\r\nGalapagos Archipelago a distinct botanical province; but this Flora is\r\nnot nearly so peculiar as that of St. Helena, nor, as I am informed by\r\nDr. Hooker, of Juan Fernandez. The peculiarity of the Galapageian Flora\r\nis best shown in certain families;—thus there are 21 species of\r\nCompositæ, of which 20 are peculiar to this archipelago; these belong\r\nto twelve genera, and of these genera no less than ten are confined to\r\nthe archipelago! Dr. Hooker informs me that the Flora has an undoubted\r\nWestern American character; nor can he detect in it any affinity with\r\nthat of the Pacific. If, therefore, we except the eighteen marine, the\r\none fresh-water, and one land-shell, which have apparently come here as\r\ncolonists from the central islands of the Pacific, and likewise the one\r\ndistinct Pacific species of the Galapageian group of finches, we see\r\nthat this archipelago, though standing in the Pacific Ocean, is\r\nzoologically part of America.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf this character were owing merely to immigrants from America, there\r\nwould be little remarkable in it; but we see that a vast majority of\r\nall the land animals, and that more than half of the flowering plants,\r\nare aboriginal productions. It was most striking to be surrounded by\r\nnew birds, new reptiles, new shells, new insects, new plants, and yet\r\nby innumerable trifling details of structure, and even by the tones of\r\nvoice and plumage of the birds, to have the temperate plains of\r\nPatagonia, or the hot dry deserts of Northern Chile, vividly brought\r\nbefore my eyes. Why, on these small points of land, which within a late\r\ngeological period must have been covered by the ocean, which are formed\r\nof basaltic lava, and therefore differ in geological character from the\r\nAmerican continent, and which are placed under a peculiar climate,—why\r\nwere their aboriginal inhabitants, associated, I may add, in different\r\nproportions both in kind and number from those on the continent, and\r\ntherefore acting on each other in a different manner—why were they\r\ncreated on American types of organisation? It is probable that the\r\nislands of the Cape de Verd group resemble, in all their physical\r\nconditions, far more closely the Galapagos Islands than these latter\r\nphysically resemble the coast of America, yet the aboriginal\r\ninhabitants of the two groups are totally unlike; those of the Cape de\r\nVerd Islands bearing the impress of Africa, as the inhabitants of the\r\nGalapagos Archipelago are stamped with that of America.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have not as yet noticed by far the most remarkable feature in the\r\nnatural history of this archipelago; it is, that the different islands\r\nto a considerable extent are inhabited by a different set of beings. My\r\nattention was first called to this fact by the Vice-Governor, Mr.\r\nLawson, declaring that the tortoises differed from the different\r\nislands, and that he could with certainty tell from which island any\r\none was brought. I did not for some time pay sufficient attention to\r\nthis statement, and I had already partially mingled together the\r\ncollections from two of the islands. I never dreamed that islands,\r\nabout 50 or 60 miles apart, and most of them in sight of each other,\r\nformed of precisely the same rocks, placed under a quite similar\r\nclimate, rising to a nearly equal height, would have been differently\r\ntenanted; but we shall soon see that this is\r\nthe case. It is the fate of most voyagers, no sooner to discover what\r\nis most interesting in any locality, than they are hurried from it; but\r\nI ought, perhaps, to be thankful that I obtained sufficient materials\r\nto establish this most remarkable fact in the distribution of organic\r\nbeings.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants, as I have said, state that they can distinguish the\r\ntortoises from the different islands; and that they differ not only in\r\nsize, but in other characters. Captain Porter has described[5] those\r\nfrom Charles and from the nearest island to it, namely, Hood Island, as\r\nhaving their shells in front thick and turned up like a Spanish saddle,\r\nwhilst the tortoises from James Island are rounder, blacker, and have a\r\nbetter taste when cooked. M. Bibron, moreover, informs me that he has\r\nseen what he considers two distinct species of tortoise from the\r\nGalapagos, but he does not know from which islands. The specimens that\r\nI brought from three islands were young ones: and probably owing to\r\nthis cause neither Mr. Gray nor myself could find in them any specific\r\ndifferences. I have remarked that the marine Amblyrhynchus was larger\r\nat Albemarle Island than elsewhere; and M. Bibron informs me that he\r\nhas seen two distinct aquatic species of this genus; so that the\r\ndifferent islands probably have their representative species or races\r\nof the Amblyrhynchus, as well as of the tortoise. My attention was\r\nfirst thoroughly aroused by comparing together the numerous specimens,\r\nshot by myself and several other parties on board, of the\r\nmocking-thrushes, when, to my astonishment, I discovered that all those\r\nfrom Charles Island belonged to one species (Mimus trifasciatus) all\r\nfrom Albemarle Island to M. parvulus; and all from James and Chatham\r\nIslands (between which two other islands are situated, as connecting\r\nlinks) belonged to M. melanotis. These two latter species are closely\r\nallied, and would by some ornithologists be considered as only\r\nwell-marked races or varieties; but the Mimus trifasciatus is very\r\ndistinct. Unfortunately most of the specimens of the finch tribe were\r\nmingled together; but I have strong reasons to suspect that some of the\r\nspecies of the sub-group Geospiza are confined to separate islands. If\r\nthe different islands have their representatives of Geospiza, it may\r\nhelp to explain the singularly\r\nlarge number of the species of this sub-group in this one small\r\narchipelago, and as a probable consequence of their numbers, the\r\nperfectly graduated series in the size of their beaks. Two species of\r\nthe sub-group Cactornis, and two of the Camarhynchus, were procured in\r\nthe archipelago; and of the numerous specimens of these two sub-groups\r\nshot by four collectors at James Island, all were found to belong to\r\none species of each; whereas the numerous specimens shot either on\r\nChatham or Charles Island (for the two sets were mingled together) all\r\nbelonged to the two other species: hence we may feel almost sure that\r\nthese islands possess their representative species of these two\r\nsub-groups. In land-shells this law of distribution does not appear to\r\nhold good. In my very small collection of insects, Mr. Waterhouse\r\nremarks that of those which were ticketed with their locality, not one\r\nwas common to any two of the islands.\r\n\r\n [5] _Voyage in the U.S. ship Essex,_ vol. i, p. 215.\r\n\r\nIf we now turn to the Flora, we shall find the aboriginal plants of the\r\ndifferent islands wonderfully different. I give all the following\r\nresults on the high authority of my friend Dr. J. Hooker. I may premise\r\nthat I indiscriminately collected everything in flower on the different\r\nislands, and fortunately kept my collections separate. Too much\r\nconfidence, however, must not be placed in the proportional results, as\r\nthe small collections brought home by some other naturalists though in\r\nsome respects confirming the results, plainly show that much remains to\r\nbe done in the botany of this group: the Leguminosæ, moreover, have as\r\nyet been only approximately worked out:—\r\n\r\n\r\nName               Total      No. of          No. of       No.         No. of Species\r\nof                 No. of     Species found   Species      confined    confined to the\r\nIsland             Species    in other        confined     to the one  Galapagos\r\n                              parts of        to the       Island      Archipelago,\r\n                              the world       Galapagos                but found on\r\n                                              Archipelago              more than the\r\n                                                                       one Island\r\n\r\nJames Island       71         33              38           30          8\r\nAlbermarle Island  46         18              26           22          4\r\nChatham Island     32         16              16           12          4\r\nCharles Island     68         39              29           21          8\r\n                          (or 29, if the\r\n                            probably\r\n                          imported plants\r\n                           be subtracted)\r\n\r\nHence we have the truly wonderful fact, that in James Island, of the\r\nthirty-eight Galapageian plants, or those found in no other part of the\r\nworld, thirty are exclusively confined to this one island; and in\r\nAlbemarle Island, of the twenty-six aboriginal Galapageian plants,\r\ntwenty-two are confined to this one island, that is, only four are at\r\npresent known to grow in the other islands of the archipelago; and so\r\non, as shown in the above table, with the plants from Chatham and\r\nCharles Islands. This fact will, perhaps, be rendered even more\r\nstriking, by giving a few illustrations:—thus, Scalesia, a remarkable\r\narborescent genus of the Compositæ, is confined to the archipelago: it\r\nhas six species: one from Chatham, one from Albemarle, one from Charles\r\nIsland, two from James Island, and the sixth from one of the three\r\nlatter islands, but it is not known from which: not one of these six\r\nspecies grows on any two islands. Again, Euphorbia, a mundane or widely\r\ndistributed genus, has here eight species, of which seven are confined\r\nto the archipelago, and not one found on any two islands: Acalypha and\r\nBorreria, both mundane genera, have respectively six and seven species,\r\nnone of which have the same species on two islands, with the exception\r\nof one Borreria, which does occur on two islands. The species of the\r\nCompositæ are particularly local; and Dr. Hooker has furnished me with\r\nseveral other most striking illustrations of the difference of the\r\nspecies on the different islands. He remarks that this law of\r\ndistribution holds good both with those genera confined to the\r\narchipelago, and those distributed in other quarters of the world: in\r\nlike manner we have seen that the different islands have their proper\r\nspecies of the mundane genus of tortoise, and of the widely distributed\r\nAmerican genus of the mocking-thrush, as well as of two of the\r\nGalapageian sub-groups of finches, and almost certainly of the\r\nGalapageian genus Amblyrhynchus.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of the tenants of this archipelago would not be nearly\r\nso wonderful, if, for instance, one island had a mocking-thrush, and a\r\nsecond island some other quite distinct genus;—if one island had its\r\ngenus of lizard, and a second island another distinct genus, or none\r\nwhatever;—or if the different islands were inhabited, not by\r\nrepresentative species of the same genera of plants, but by totally\r\ndifferent\r\ngenera, as does to a certain extent hold good; for, to give one\r\ninstance, a large berry-bearing tree at James Island has no\r\nrepresentative species in Charles Island. But it is the circumstance\r\nthat several of the islands possess their own species of the tortoise,\r\nmocking-thrush, finches, and numerous plants, these species having the\r\nsame general habits, occupying analogous situations, and obviously\r\nfilling the same place in the natural economy of this archipelago, that\r\nstrikes me with wonder. It may be suspected that some of these\r\nrepresentative species, at least in the case of the tortoise and of\r\nsome of the birds, may hereafter prove to be only well-marked races;\r\nbut this would be of equally great interest to the philosophical\r\nnaturalist. I have said that most of the islands are in sight of each\r\nother: I may specify that Charles Island is fifty miles from the\r\nnearest part of Chatham Island, and thirty-three miles from the nearest\r\npart of Albemarle Island. Chatham Island is sixty miles from the\r\nnearest part of James Island, but there are two intermediate islands\r\nbetween them which were not visited by me. James Island is only ten\r\nmiles from the nearest part of Albemarle Island, but the two points\r\nwhere the collections were made are thirty-two miles apart. I must\r\nrepeat, that neither the nature of the soil, nor height of the land,\r\nnor the climate, nor the general character of the associated beings,\r\nand therefore their action one on another, can differ much in the\r\ndifferent islands. If there be any sensible difference in their\r\nclimates, it must be between the windward group (namely, Charles and\r\nChatham Islands), and that to leeward; but there seems to be no\r\ncorresponding difference in the productions of these two halves of the\r\narchipelago.\r\n\r\nThe only light which I can throw on this remarkable difference in the\r\ninhabitants of the different islands is that very strong currents of\r\nthe sea running in a westerly and W.N.W. direction must separate, as\r\nfar as transportal by the sea is concerned, the southern islands from\r\nthe northern ones; and between these northern islands a strong N.W.\r\ncurrent was observed, which must effectually separate James and\r\nAlbemarle Islands. As the archipelago is free to a most remarkable\r\ndegree from gales of wind, neither the birds, insects, nor lighter\r\nseeds, would be blown from island to island. And lastly, the profound\r\ndepth of the ocean between the islands, and their\r\napparently recent (in a geological sense) volcanic origin, render it\r\nhighly unlikely that they were ever united; and this, probably, is a\r\nfar more important consideration than any other with respect to the\r\ngeographical distribution of their inhabitants. Reviewing the facts\r\nhere given, one is astonished at the amount of creative force, if such\r\nan expression may be used, displayed on these small, barren, and rocky\r\nislands; and still more so, at its diverse yet analogous action on\r\npoints so near each other. I have said that the Galapagos Archipelago\r\nmight be called a satellite attached to America, but it should rather\r\nbe called a group of satellites, physically similar, organically\r\ndistinct, yet intimately related to each other, and all related in a\r\nmarked though much lesser degree, to the great American continent.\r\n\r\n\r\nI will conclude my description of the natural history of these islands\r\nby giving an account of the extreme tameness of the birds.\r\n\r\nThis disposition is common to all the terrestrial species; namely, to\r\nthe mocking-thrushes, the finches, wrens, tyrant-flycatchers, the dove,\r\nand carrion-buzzard. All of them often approached sufficiently near to\r\nbe killed with a switch, and sometimes, as I myself tried, with a cap\r\nor hat. A gun is here almost superfluous; for with the muzzle I pushed\r\na hawk off the branch of a tree. One day, whilst lying down, a\r\nmocking-thrush alighted on the edge of a pitcher, made of the shell of\r\na tortoise, which I held in my hand, and began very quietly to sip the\r\nwater; it allowed me to lift it from the ground whilst seated on the\r\nvessel: I often tried, and very nearly succeeded, in catching these\r\nbirds by their legs. Formerly the birds appear to have been even tamer\r\nthan at present. Cowley (in the year 1684) says that the “Turtledoves\r\nwere so tame, that they would often alight on our hats and arms, so as\r\nthat we could take them alive: they not fearing man, until such time as\r\nsome of our company did fire at them, whereby they were rendered more\r\nshy.” Dampier also, in the same year, says that a man in a morning’s\r\nwalk might kill six or seven dozen of these doves. At present, although\r\ncertainly very tame, they do not alight on people’s arms, nor do they\r\nsuffer themselves to be killed in such large\r\nnumbers. It is surprising that they have not become wilder; for these\r\nislands during the last hundred and fifty years have been frequently\r\nvisited by bucaniers and whalers; and the sailors, wandering through\r\nthe wood in search of tortoises, always take cruel delight in knocking\r\ndown the little birds.\r\n\r\nThese birds, although now still more persecuted, do not readily become\r\nwild: in Charles Island, which had then been colonised about six years,\r\nI saw a boy sitting by a well with a switch in his hand, with which he\r\nkilled the doves and finches as they came to drink. He had already\r\nprocured a little heap of them for his dinner, and he said that he had\r\nconstantly been in the habit of waiting by this well for the same\r\npurpose. It would appear that the birds of this archipelago, not having\r\nas yet learnt that man is a more dangerous animal than the tortoise or\r\nthe Amblyrhynchus, disregard him, in the same manner as in England shy\r\nbirds, such as magpies, disregard the cows and horses grazing in our\r\nfields.\r\n\r\nThe Falkland Islands offer a second instance of birds with a similar\r\ndisposition. The extraordinary tameness of the little Opetiorhynchus\r\nhas been remarked by Pernety, Lesson, and other voyagers. It is not,\r\nhowever, peculiar to that bird: the Polyborus, snipe, upland and\r\nlowland goose, thrush, bunting, and even some true hawks, are all more\r\nor less tame. As the birds are so tame there, where foxes, hawks, and\r\nowls occur, we may infer that the absence of all rapacious animals at\r\nthe Galapagos is not the cause of their tameness here. The upland geese\r\nat the Falklands show, by the precaution they take in building on the\r\nislets, that they are aware of their danger from the foxes; but they\r\nare not by this rendered wild towards man. This tameness of the birds,\r\nespecially of the waterfowl, is strongly contrasted with the habits of\r\nthe same species in Tierra del Fuego, where for ages past they have\r\nbeen persecuted by the wild inhabitants. In the Falklands, the\r\nsportsman may sometimes kill more of the upland geese in one day than\r\nhe can carry home; whereas in Tierra del Fuego it is nearly as\r\ndifficult to kill one as it is in England to shoot the common wild\r\ngoose.\r\n\r\nIn the time of Pernety (1763) all the birds there appear to have been\r\nmuch tamer than at present; he states that the Opetiorhynchus would\r\nalmost perch on his finger; and that\r\nwith a wand he killed ten in half an hour. At that period the birds\r\nmust have been about as tame as they now are at the Galapagos. They\r\nappear to have learnt caution more slowly at these latter islands than\r\nat the Falklands, where they have had proportionate means of\r\nexperience; for besides frequent visits from vessels, those islands\r\nhave been at intervals colonised during the entire period. Even\r\nformerly, when all the birds were so tame, it was impossible by\r\nPernety’s account to kill the black-necked swan—a bird of passage,\r\nwhich probably brought with it the wisdom learnt in foreign countries.\r\n\r\nI may add that, according to Du Bois, all the birds at Bourbon in\r\n1571-72, with the exception of the flamingoes and geese, were so\r\nextremely tame, that they could be caught by the hand, or killed in any\r\nnumber with a stick. Again, at Tristan d’Acunha in the Atlantic,\r\nCarmichael[6] states that the only two land-birds, a thrush and a\r\nbunting, were “so tame as to suffer themselves to be caught with a\r\nhand-net.” From these several facts we may, I think, conclude, first,\r\nthat the wildness of birds with regard to man is a particular instinct\r\ndirected against _him_, and not dependent upon any general degree of\r\ncaution arising from other sources of danger; secondly, that it is not\r\nacquired by individual birds in a short time, even when much\r\npersecuted; but that in the course of successive generations it becomes\r\nhereditary. With domesticated animals we are accustomed to see new\r\nmental habits or instincts acquired and rendered hereditary; but with\r\nanimals in a state of nature it must always be most difficult to\r\ndiscover instances of acquired hereditary knowledge. In regard to the\r\nwildness of birds towards man, there is no way of accounting for it,\r\nexcept as an inherited habit: comparatively few young birds, in any one\r\nyear, have been injured by man in England, yet almost all, even\r\nnestlings, are afraid of him; many individuals, on the other hand, both\r\nat the Galapagos and at the Falklands, have\r\nbeen pursued and injured by man, but yet have not learned a salutary\r\ndread of him. We may infer from these facts, what havoc the\r\nintroduction of any new beast of prey must cause in a country, before\r\nthe instincts of the indigenous inhabitants have become adapted to the\r\nstranger’s craft or power.\r\n\r\n [6] _Linn. Trans._ vol. xii, p. 496. The most anomalous fact on this\r\n subject which I have met with is the wildness of the small birds in\r\n the Arctic parts of North America (as described by Richardson _Fauna\r\n Bor._ vol. ii, p. 332), where they are said never to be persecuted.\r\n This case is the more strange, because it is asserted that some of the\r\n same species in their winter-quarters in the United States are tame.\r\n There is much, as Dr. Richardson well remarks, utterly inexplicable\r\n connected with the different degrees of shyness and care with which\r\n birds conceal their nests. How strange it is that the English\r\n wood-pigeon, generally so wild a bird, should very frequently rear its\r\n young in shrubberies close to houses!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Opuntia Galapageia]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ava or kava (Macropiper Methysticum), Tahiti]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nTAHITI AND NEW ZEALAND\r\n\r\nPass through the Low Archipelago—Tahiti—Aspect—Vegetation on the\r\nmountains—View of Eimeo—Excursion into the interior—Profound\r\nravines—Succession of waterfalls—Number of wild useful\r\nplants—Temperance of the inhabitants—Their moral state—Parliament\r\nconvened—New Zealand—Bay of islands—Hippahs—Excursion to\r\nWaimate—Missionary establishment—English weeds now run\r\nwild—Waiomio—Funeral of a New Zealand woman—Sail for Australia.\r\n\r\n_October_ 20_th._—The survey of the Galapagos Archipelago being\r\nconcluded, we steered towards Tahiti and commenced our long passage of\r\n3200 miles. In the course of a few days we sailed out of the gloomy and\r\nclouded ocean-district which extends during the winter far from the\r\ncoast of South America. We then enjoyed bright and clear weather, while\r\nrunning pleasantly along at the rate of 150 or 160 miles a day before\r\nthe steady trade-wind. The temperature in this more central part of the\r\nPacific is higher than near the American shore. The\r\nthermometer in the poop cabin, by night and day, ranged between 80° and\r\n83°, which feels very pleasant; but with one degree or two higher, the\r\nheat becomes oppressive. We passed through the Low or Dangerous\r\nArchipelago, and saw several of those most curious rings of coral land,\r\njust rising above the water’s edge, which have been called Lagoon\r\nIslands. A long and brilliantly-white beach is capped by a margin of\r\ngreen vegetation; and the strip, looking either way, rapidly narrows\r\naway in the distance, and sinks beneath the horizon. From the mast-head\r\na wide expanse of smooth water can be seen within the ring. These low\r\nhollow coral islands bear no proportion to the vast ocean out of which\r\nthey abruptly rise; and it seems wonderful that such weak invaders are\r\nnot overwhelmed by the all-powerful and never-tiring waves of that\r\ngreat sea, miscalled the Pacific.\r\n\r\n_November_ 15_th._—At daylight, Tahiti, an island which must for ever\r\nremain classical to the voyager in the South Sea, was in view. At a\r\ndistance the appearance was not attractive. The luxuriant vegetation of\r\nthe lower part could not yet be seen, and as the clouds rolled past,\r\nthe wildest and most precipitous peaks showed themselves towards the\r\ncentre of the island. As soon as we anchored in Matavai Bay, we were\r\nsurrounded by canoes. This was our Sunday, but the Monday of Tahiti: if\r\nthe case had been reversed, we should not have received a single visit;\r\nfor the injunction not to launch a canoe on the Sabbath is rigidly\r\nobeyed. After dinner we landed to enjoy all the delights produced by\r\nthe first impressions of a new country, and that country the charming\r\nTahiti. A crowd of men, women, and children, was collected on the\r\nmemorable Point Venus, ready to receive us with laughing, merry faces.\r\nThey marshalled us towards the house of Mr. Wilson, the missionary of\r\nthe district, who met us on the road, and gave us a very friendly\r\nreception. After sitting a short time in his house, we separated to\r\nwalk about, but returned there in the evening.\r\n\r\nThe land capable of cultivation is scarcely in any part more than a\r\nfringe of low alluvial soil, accumulated round the base of the\r\nmountains, and protected from the waves of the sea by a coral reef,\r\nwhich encircles the entire line of coast. Within the reef there is an\r\nexpanse of smooth water, like that of a lake, where\r\nthe canoes of the natives can ply with safety and where ships anchor.\r\nThe low land which comes down to the beach of coral-sand is covered by\r\nthe most beautiful productions of the intertropical regions. In the\r\nmidst of bananas, orange, cocoa-nut, and bread-fruit trees, spots are\r\ncleared where yams, sweet potatoes, the sugar-cane, and pine-apples are\r\ncultivated. Even the brushwood is an imported fruit-tree, namely, the\r\nguava, which from its abundance has become as noxious as a weed. In\r\nBrazil I have often admired the varied beauty of the bananas, palms,\r\nand orange-trees contrasted together; and here we also have the\r\nbread-fruit, conspicuous from its large, glossy, and deeply digitated\r\nleaf. It is admirable to behold groves of a tree, sending forth its\r\nbranches with the vigour of an English oak, loaded with large and most\r\nnutritious fruit. However seldom the usefulness of an object can\r\naccount for the pleasure of beholding it, in the case of these\r\nbeautiful woods, the knowledge of their high productiveness no doubt\r\nenters largely into the feeling of admiration. The little winding\r\npaths, cool from the surrounding shade, led to the scattered houses;\r\nthe owners of which everywhere gave us a cheerful and most hospitable\r\nreception.\r\n\r\nI was pleased with nothing so much as with the inhabitants. There is a\r\nmildness in the expression of their countenances which at once banishes\r\nthe idea of a savage; and an intelligence which shows that they are\r\nadvancing in civilisation. The common people, when working, keep the\r\nupper part of their bodies quite naked; and it is then that the\r\nTahitians are seen to advantage. They are very tall, broad-shouldered,\r\nathletic, and well-proportioned. It has been remarked that it requires\r\nlittle habit to make a dark skin more pleasing and natural to the eye\r\nof a European than his own colour. A white man bathing by the side of a\r\nTahitian was like a plant bleached by the gardener’s art compared with\r\na fine dark green one growing vigorously in the open fields. Most of\r\nthe men are tattooed, and the ornaments follow the curvature of the\r\nbody so gracefully that they have a very elegant effect. One common\r\npattern, varying in its details, is somewhat like the crown of a\r\npalm-tree. It springs from the central line of the back, and gracefully\r\ncurls round both sides. The simile may be a fanciful one, but I thought\r\nthe body of a man thus ornamented\r\nwas like the trunk of a noble tree embraced by a delicate creeper.\r\n\r\nMany of the elder people had their feet covered with small figures, so\r\nplaced as to resemble a sock. This fashion, however, is partly gone by,\r\nand has been succeeded by others. Here, although fashion is far from\r\nimmutable, every one must abide by that prevailing in his youth. An old\r\nman has thus his age for ever stamped on his body, and he cannot assume\r\nthe airs of a young dandy. The women are tattooed in the same manner as\r\nthe men, and very commonly on their fingers. One unbecoming fashion is\r\nnow almost universal: namely, shaving the hair from the upper part of\r\nthe head, in a circular form, so as to leave only an outer ring. The\r\nmissionaries have tried to persuade the people to change this habit;\r\nbut it is the fashion, and that is a sufficient answer at Tahiti, as\r\nwell as at Paris. I was much disappointed in the personal appearance of\r\nthe women: they are far inferior in every respect to the men. The\r\ncustom of wearing a white or scarlet flower in the back of the head, or\r\nthrough a small hole in each ear, is pretty. A crown of woven cocoa-nut\r\nleaves is also worn as a shade for the eyes. The women appear to be in\r\ngreater want of some becoming costume even than the men.\r\n\r\nNearly all the natives understand a little English—that is, they know\r\nthe names of common things; and by the aid of this, together with\r\nsigns, a lame sort of conversation could be carried on. In returning in\r\nthe evening to the boat, we stopped to witness a very pretty scene.\r\nNumbers of children were playing on the beach, and had lighted bonfires\r\nwhich illumined the placid sea and surrounding trees; others, in\r\ncircles, were singing Tahitian verses. We seated ourselves on the sand,\r\nand joined their party. The songs were impromptu, and I believe related\r\nto our arrival: one little girl sang a line, which the rest took up in\r\nparts, forming a very pretty chorus. The whole scene made us\r\nunequivocally aware that we were seated on the shores of an island in\r\nthe far-famed South Sea.\r\n\r\n17_th._—This day is reckoned in the log-book as Tuesday the 17th,\r\ninstead of Monday the 16th, owing to our, so far, successful chase of\r\nthe sun. Before breakfast the ship was hemmed in by a flotilla of\r\ncanoes; and when the natives were allowed to come on board, I suppose\r\nthere could not have\r\nbeen less than two hundred. It was the opinion of every one that it\r\nwould have been difficult to have picked out an equal number from any\r\nother nation, who would have given so little trouble. Everybody brought\r\nsomething for sale: shells were the main article of trade. The\r\nTahitians now fully understand the value of money, and prefer it to old\r\nclothes or other articles. The various coins, however, of English and\r\nSpanish denomination puzzle them, and they never seemed to think the\r\nsmall silver quite secure until changed into dollars. Some of the\r\nchiefs have accumulated considerable sums of money. One chief, not long\r\nsince, offered 800 dollars (about £160 sterling) for a small vessel;\r\nand frequently they purchase whale-boats and horses at the rate of from\r\n50 to 100 dollars.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast I went on shore, and ascended the nearest slope to a\r\nheight of between two and three thousand feet. The outer mountains are\r\nsmooth and conical, but steep; and the old volcanic rocks, of which\r\nthey are formed, have been cut through by many profound ravines,\r\ndiverging from the central broken parts of the island to the coast.\r\nHaving crossed the narrow low girt of inhabited and fertile land, I\r\nfollowed a smooth steep ridge between two of the deep ravines. The\r\nvegetation was singular, consisting almost exclusively of small dwarf\r\nferns, mingled, higher up, with coarse grass; it was not very\r\ndissimilar from that on some of the Welsh hills, and this so close\r\nabove the orchard of tropical plants on the coast was very surprising.\r\nAt the highest point which I reached trees again appeared. Of the three\r\nzones of comparative luxuriance, the lower one owes its moisture, and\r\ntherefore fertility, to its flatness; for, being scarcely raised above\r\nthe level of the sea, the water from the higher land drains away\r\nslowly. The intermediate zone does not, like the upper one, reach into\r\na damp and cloudy atmosphere, and therefore remains sterile. The woods\r\nin the upper zone are very pretty, tree-ferns replacing the cocoa-nuts\r\non the coast. It must not, however, be supposed that these woods at all\r\nequal in splendour the forests of Brazil. The vast number of\r\nproductions, which characterise a continent, cannot be expected to\r\noccur in an island.\r\n\r\nEimeo and Barrier-Reef\r\n\r\nFrom the highest point which I attained there was a good view of the\r\ndistant island of Eimeo, dependent on the same\r\nsovereign with Tahiti. On the lofty and broken pinnacles white massive\r\nclouds were piled up, which formed an island in the blue sky, as Eimeo\r\nitself did in the blue ocean. The island, with the exception of one\r\nsmall gateway, is completely encircled by a reef. At this distance, a\r\nnarrow but well-defined brilliantly white line was alone visible, where\r\nthe waves first encountered the wall of coral. The mountains rose\r\nabruptly out of the glassy expanse of the lagoon, included within this\r\nnarrow white line, outside which the heaving waters of the ocean were\r\ndark-coloured. The view was striking: it may aptly be compared to a\r\nframed engraving, where the frame represents the breakers, the marginal\r\npaper the smooth lagoon, and the drawing the island itself. When in the\r\nevening I descended from the mountain, a man, whom I had pleased with a\r\ntrifling gift, met me, bringing with him hot roasted bananas, a\r\npine-apple, and cocoa-nuts. After walking under a burning sun, I do not\r\nknow anything more delicious than the milk of a young cocoa-nut.\r\nPine-apples are here so abundant that the people eat them in the same\r\nwasteful manner as we might turnips. They are of an excellent\r\nflavour—perhaps even better than those cultivated in England; and this\r\nI believe is the highest compliment which can be paid to any fruit.\r\nBefore going on board, Mr. Wilson interpreted for me to the Tahitian\r\nwho had paid me so adroit an attention, that I wanted him and another\r\nman to accompany me on a short excursion into the mountains.\r\n\r\n\r\n18_th._—In the morning I came on shore early, bringing with me some\r\nprovisions in a bag, and two blankets for myself and servant. These\r\nwere lashed to each end of a long pole, which was alternately carried\r\nby my Tahitian companions on their shoulders. These men are accustomed\r\nthus to carry, for a whole day, as much as fifty pounds at each end of\r\ntheir poles. I told my guides to provide themselves with food and\r\nclothing; but they said that there was plenty of food in the mountains,\r\nand for clothing, that their skins were sufficient. Our line of march\r\nwas the valley of Tia-auru, down which a river flows into the sea by\r\nPoint Venus. This is one of the principal streams in the island, and\r\nits source lies at the base of the loftiest central pinnacles, which\r\nrise to a height of about\r\n7000 feet. The whole island is so mountainous that the only way to\r\npenetrate into the interior is to follow up the valleys. Our road, at\r\nfirst, lay through woods which bordered each side of the river; and the\r\nglimpses of the lofty central peaks, seen as through an avenue, with\r\nhere and there a waving cocoa-nut tree on one side, were extremely\r\npicturesque. The valley soon began to narrow, and the sides to grow\r\nlofty and more precipitous. After having walked between three and four\r\nhours, we found the width of the ravine scarcely exceeded that of the\r\nbed of the stream. On each hand the walls were nearly vertical; yet\r\nfrom the soft nature of the volcanic strata, trees and a rank\r\nvegetation sprung from every projecting ledge. These precipices must\r\nhave been some thousand feet high; and the whole formed a mountain\r\ngorge far more magnificent than anything which I had ever before\r\nbeheld. Until the mid-day sun stood vertically over the ravine, the air\r\nfelt cool and damp, but now it became very sultry. Shaded by a ledge of\r\nrock, beneath a façade of columnar lava, we ate our dinner. My guides\r\nhad already procured a dish of small fish and fresh-water prawns. They\r\ncarried with them a small net stretched on a hoop; and where the water\r\nwas deep and in eddies, they dived, and like otters, with their eyes\r\nopen followed the fish into holes and corners, and thus caught them.\r\n\r\nThe Tahitians have the dexterity of amphibious animals in the water. An\r\nanecdote mentioned by Ellis shows how much they feel at home in this\r\nelement. When a horse was landing for Pomarre in 1817, the slings\r\nbroke, and it fell into the water; immediately the natives jumped\r\noverboard, and by their cries and vain efforts at assistance almost\r\ndrowned it. As soon, however, as it reached the shore, the whole\r\npopulation took to flight, and tried to hide themselves from the\r\nman-carrying pig, as they christened the horse.\r\n\r\nA little higher up, the river divided itself into three little streams.\r\nThe two northern ones were impracticable, owing to a succession of\r\nwaterfalls which descended from the jagged summit of the highest\r\nmountain; the other to all appearance was equally inaccessible, but we\r\nmanaged to ascend it by a most extraordinary road. The sides of the\r\nvalley were here nearly precipitous; but, as frequently happens with\r\nstratified rocks, small ledges projected, which were thickly covered by\r\nwild bananas, liliaceous plants, and other luxuriant productions of the\r\ntropics. The Tahitians, by climbing amongst these ledges, searching for\r\nfruit, had discovered a track by which the whole precipice could be\r\nscaled. The first ascent from the valley was very dangerous; for it was\r\nnecessary to pass a steeply inclined face of naked rock by the aid of\r\nropes which we brought with us. How any person discovered that this\r\nformidable spot was the only point where the side of the mountain was\r\npracticable, I cannot imagine. We then cautiously walked along one of\r\nthe ledges till we came to one of the three streams. This ledge formed\r\na flat spot above which a beautiful cascade, some hundred feet in\r\nheight, poured down its waters, and beneath, another high cascade fell\r\ninto the main stream in the valley below. From this cool and shady\r\nrecess we made a circuit to avoid the overhanging waterfall. As before,\r\nwe followed little projecting ledges, the danger being partly concealed\r\nby the thickness of the vegetation. In passing from one of the ledges\r\nto another there was a vertical wall of rock. One of the Tahitians, a\r\nfine active man, placed the trunk of a tree against this, climbed up\r\nit, and then by the aid of crevices reached the summit. He fixed the\r\nropes to a projecting point, and lowered them for our dog and luggage,\r\nand then we clambered up ourselves. Beneath the ledge on which the dead\r\ntree was placed, the precipice must have been five or six hundred feet\r\ndeep; and if the abyss had not been partly concealed by the overhanging\r\nferns and lilies my head would have turned giddy, and nothing should\r\nhave induced me to have attempted it. We continued to ascend, sometimes\r\nalong ledges, and sometimes along knife-edged ridges, having on each\r\nhand profound ravines. In the Cordillera I have seen mountains on a far\r\ngrander scale, but for abruptness nothing at all comparable with this.\r\nIn the evening we reached a flat little spot on the banks of the same\r\nstream which we had continued to follow, and which descends in a chain\r\nof waterfalls: here we bivouacked for the night. On each side of the\r\nravine there were great beds of the mountain-banana, covered with ripe\r\nfruit. Many of these plants were from twenty to twenty-five feet high,\r\nand from three to four in circumference. By the aid of strips of bark\r\nfor rope, the stems of bamboos for rafters, and the large leaf of\r\nthe banana for a thatch, the Tahitians in a few minutes built us an\r\nexcellent house; and with withered leaves made a soft bed.\r\n\r\nFatahua Fall, Tahiti\r\n\r\nThey then proceeded to make a fire, and cook our evening meal. A light\r\nwas procured by rubbing a blunt pointed stick in a groove made in\r\nanother, as if with intention of deepening it, until by the friction\r\nthe dust became ignited. A peculiarly white and very light wood (the\r\nHibiscus tiliaceus) is alone used for this purpose: it is the same\r\nwhich serves for poles to carry any burden, and for the floating\r\nout-riggers to their canoes. The fire was produced in a few seconds:\r\nbut to a person who does not understand the art, it requires, as I\r\nfound, the greatest exertion; but at last, to my great pride, I\r\nsucceeded in igniting the dust. The Gaucho in the Pampas uses a\r\ndifferent method: taking an elastic stick about eighteen inches long,\r\nhe presses one end on his breast, and the other pointed end into a hole\r\nin a piece of wood, and then rapidly turns the curved part like a\r\ncarpenter’s centre-bit. The Tahitians having made a small fire of\r\nsticks, placed a score of stones of about the size of cricket-balls, on\r\nthe burning wood. In about ten minutes the sticks were consumed, and\r\nthe stones hot. They had previously folded up in small parcels of\r\nleaves, pieces of beef, fish, ripe and unripe bananas, and the tops of\r\nthe wild arum. These green parcels were laid in a layer between two\r\nlayers of the hot stones, and the whole then covered up with earth, so\r\nthat no smoke or steam could escape. In about a quarter of an hour the\r\nwhole was most deliciously cooked. The choice green parcels were now\r\nlaid on a cloth of banana leaves, and with a cocoa-nut shell we drank\r\nthe cool water of the running stream; and thus we enjoyed our rustic\r\nmeal.\r\n\r\nI could not look on the surrounding plants without admiration. On every\r\nside were forests of bananas; the fruit of which, though serving for\r\nfood in various ways, lay in heaps decaying on the ground. In front of\r\nus there was an extensive brake of wild sugar-cane; and the stream was\r\nshaded by the dark green knotted stem of the Ava,—so famous in former\r\ndays for its powerful intoxicating effects. I chewed a piece, and found\r\nthat it had an acrid and unpleasant taste, which would have induced any\r\none at once to have pronounced it poisonous. Thanks to the\r\nmissionaries, this plant now thrives\r\nonly in these deep ravines, innocuous to every one. Close by I saw the\r\nwild arum, the roots of which, when well baked, are good to eat, and\r\nthe young leaves better than spinach. There was the wild yam, and a\r\nliliaceous plant called Ti, which grows in abundance, and has a soft\r\nbrown root, in shape and size like a huge log of wood: this served us\r\nfor dessert, for it is as sweet as treacle, and with a pleasant taste.\r\nThere were, moreover, several other wild fruits, and useful vegetables.\r\nThe little stream, besides its cool water, produced eels and crayfish.\r\nI did indeed admire this scene, when I compared it with an uncultivated\r\none in the temperate zones. I felt the force of the remark that man, at\r\nleast savage man, with his reasoning powers only partly developed, is\r\nthe child of the tropics.\r\n\r\nAs the evening drew to a close, I strolled beneath the gloomy shade of\r\nthe bananas up the course of the stream. My walk was soon brought to a\r\nclose by coming to a waterfall between two and three hundred feet high;\r\nand again above this there was another. I mention all these waterfalls\r\nin this one brook to give a general idea of the inclination of the\r\nland. In the little recess where the water fell, it did not appear that\r\na breath of wind had ever blown. The thin edges of the great leaves of\r\nthe banana, damp with spray, were unbroken, instead of being, as is so\r\ngenerally the case, split into a thousand shreds. From our position,\r\nalmost suspended on the mountain-side, there were glimpses into the\r\ndepths of the neighbouring valleys; and the lofty points of the central\r\nmountains, towering up within sixty degrees of the zenith, hid half the\r\nevening sky. Thus seated, it was a sublime spectacle to watch the\r\nshades of night gradually obscuring the last and highest pinnacles.\r\n\r\nBefore we laid ourselves down to sleep, the elder Tahitian fell on his\r\nknees, and with closed eyes repeated a long prayer in his native\r\ntongue. He prayed as a Christian should do, with fitting reverence, and\r\nwithout the fear of ridicule or any ostentation of piety. At our meals\r\nneither of the men would taste food, without saying beforehand a short\r\ngrace. Those travellers who think that a Tahitian prays only when the\r\neyes of the missionary are fixed on him, should have slept with us that\r\nnight on the mountain-side. Before morning it rained\r\nvery heavily; but the good thatch of banana-leaves kept us dry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n_November_ 19_th._—At daylight my friends, after their morning prayer,\r\nprepared an excellent breakfast in the same manner as in the evening.\r\nThey themselves certainly partook of it largely; indeed I never saw any\r\nmen eat near so much. I suppose such enormously capacious stomachs must\r\nbe the effect of a large part of their diet consisting of fruit and\r\nvegetables which contain, in a given bulk, a comparatively small\r\nportion of nutriment. Unwittingly, I was the means of my companions\r\nbreaking, as I afterwards learned, one of their own laws and\r\nresolutions: I took with me a flask of spirits, which they could not\r\nrefuse to partake of; but as often as they drank a little, they put\r\ntheir fingers before their mouths, and uttered the word “Missionary.”\r\nAbout two years ago, although the use of the ava was prevented,\r\ndrunkenness from the introduction of spirits became very prevalent. The\r\nmissionaries prevailed on a few good men who saw that their country was\r\nrapidly going to ruin, to join with them in a Temperance Society. From\r\ngood sense or shame, all the chiefs and the queen were at last\r\npersuaded to join. Immediately a law was passed that no spirits should\r\nbe allowed to be introduced into the island, and that he who sold and\r\nhe who bought the forbidden article should be punished by a fine. With\r\nremarkable justice, a\r\ncertain period was allowed for stock in hand to be sold, before the law\r\ncame into effect. But when it did, a general search was made, in which\r\neven the houses of the missionaries were not exempted, and all the ava\r\n(as the natives call all ardent spirits) was poured on the ground. When\r\none reflects on the effect of intemperance on the aborigines of the two\r\nAmericas, I think it will be acknowledged that every well-wisher of\r\nTahiti owes no common debt of gratitude to the missionaries. As long as\r\nthe little island of St. Helena remained under the government of the\r\nEast India Company, spirits, owing to the great injury they had\r\nproduced, were not allowed to be imported; but wine was supplied from\r\nthe Cape of Good Hope. It is rather a striking, and not very gratifying\r\nfact, that in the same year that spirits were allowed to be sold in St.\r\nHelena, their use was banished from Tahiti by the free will of the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast we proceeded on our journey. As my object was merely to\r\nsee a little of the interior scenery, we returned by another track,\r\nwhich descended into the main valley lower down. For some distance we\r\nwound, by a most intricate path, along the side of the mountain which\r\nformed the valley. In the less precipitous parts we passed through\r\nextensive groves of the wild banana. The Tahitians, with their naked,\r\ntattooed bodies, their heads ornamented with flowers, and seen in the\r\ndark shade of these groves, would have formed a fine picture of man\r\ninhabiting some primeval land. In our descent we followed the line of\r\nridges; these were exceedingly narrow, and for considerable lengths\r\nsteep as a ladder; but all clothed with vegetation. The extreme care\r\nnecessary in poising each step rendered the walk fatiguing. I did not\r\ncease to wonder at these ravines and precipices: when viewing the\r\ncountry from one of the knife-edged ridges, the point of support was so\r\nsmall that the effect was nearly the same as it must be from a balloon.\r\nIn this descent we had occasion to use the ropes only once, at the\r\npoint where we entered the main valley. We slept under the same ledge\r\nof rock where we had dined the day before: the night was fine, but from\r\nthe depth and narrowness of the gorge, profoundly dark.\r\n\r\nBefore actually seeing this country, I found it difficult to understand\r\ntwo facts mentioned by Ellis; namely, that after\r\nthe murderous battles of former times, the survivors on the conquered\r\nside retired into the mountains, where a handful of men could resist a\r\nmultitude. Certainly half a dozen men, at the spot where the Tahitian\r\nreared the old tree, could easily have repulsed thousands. Secondly,\r\nthat after the introduction of Christianity, there were wild men who\r\nlived in the mountains, and whose retreats were unknown to the more\r\ncivilised inhabitants.\r\n\r\n\r\n_November_ 20_th._—In the morning we started early, and reached Matavai\r\nat noon. On the road we met a large party of noble athletic men, going\r\nfor wild bananas. I found that the ship, on account of the difficulty\r\nin watering, had moved to the harbour of Papawa, to which place I\r\nimmediately walked. This is a very pretty spot. The cove is surrounded\r\nby reefs, and the water as smooth as in a lake. The cultivated ground,\r\nwith its beautiful productions, interspersed with cottages, comes close\r\ndown to the water’s edge.\r\n\r\nFrom the varying accounts which I had read before reaching these\r\nislands, I was very anxious to form, from my own observation, a\r\njudgment of their moral state,—although such judgment would necessarily\r\nbe very imperfect. First impressions at all times very much depend on\r\none’s previously acquired ideas. My notions were drawn from Ellis’s\r\n_Polynesian Researches_—an admirable and most interesting work, but\r\nnaturally looking at everything under a favourable point of view, from\r\nBeechey’s _Voyage;_ and from that of Kotzebue, which is strongly\r\nadverse to the whole missionary system. He who compares these three\r\naccounts will, I think, form a tolerably accurate conception of the\r\npresent state of Tahiti. One of my impressions, which I took from the\r\ntwo last authorities, was decidedly incorrect; namely, that the\r\nTahitians had become a gloomy race, and lived in fear of the\r\nmissionaries. Of the latter feeling I saw no trace, unless, indeed,\r\nfear and respect be confounded under one name. Instead of discontent\r\nbeing a common feeling, it would be difficult in Europe to pick out of\r\na crowd half so many merry and happy faces. The prohibition of the\r\nflute and dancing is inveighed against as wrong and foolish;—the more\r\nthan presbyterian manner of keeping the Sabbath is looked at in a\r\nsimilar light. On\r\nthese points I will not pretend to offer any opinion, in opposition to\r\nmen who have resided as many years as I was days on the island.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, it appears to me that the morality and religion of the\r\ninhabitants are highly creditable. There are many who attack, even more\r\nacrimoniously than Kotzebue, both the missionaries, their system, and\r\nthe effects produced by it. Such reasoners never compare the present\r\nstate with that of the island only twenty years ago; nor even with that\r\nof Europe at this day; but they compare it with the high standard of\r\nGospel perfection. They expect the missionaries to effect that which\r\nthe Apostles themselves failed to do. Inasmuch as the condition of the\r\npeople falls short of this high standard, blame is attached to the\r\nmissionary, instead of credit for that which he has effected. They\r\nforget, or will not remember, that human sacrifices, and the power of\r\nan idolatrous priesthood—a system of profligacy unparalleled in any\r\nother part of the world—infanticide a consequence of that system—bloody\r\nwars, where the conquerors spared neither women nor children—that all\r\nthese have been abolished; and that dishonesty, intemperance, and\r\nlicentiousness have been greatly reduced by the introduction of\r\nChristianity. In a voyager to forget these things is base ingratitude;\r\nfor should he chance to be at the point of shipwreck on some unknown\r\ncoast, he will most devoutly pray that the lesson of the missionary may\r\nhave extended thus far.\r\n\r\nIn point of morality, the virtue of the women, it has been often said,\r\nis most open to exception. But before they are blamed too severely, it\r\nwill be well distinctly to call to mind the scenes described by Captain\r\nCook and Mr. Banks, in which the grandmothers and mothers of the\r\npresent race played a part. Those who are most severe, should consider\r\nhow much of the morality of the women in Europe is owing to the system\r\nearly impressed by mothers on their daughters, and how much in each\r\nindividual case to the precepts of religion. But it is useless to argue\r\nagainst such reasoners;—I believe that, disappointed in not finding the\r\nfield of licentiousness quite so open as formerly, they will not give\r\ncredit to a morality which they do not wish to practise, or to a\r\nreligion which they undervalue, if not despise.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sunday_ 22_nd._—The harbour of Papiéte, where the queen resides, may\r\nbe considered as the capital of the island: it is also the seat of\r\ngovernment, and the chief resort of shipping. Captain Fitz Roy took a\r\nparty there this day to hear divine service, first in the Tahitian\r\nlanguage, and afterwards in our own. Mr. Pritchard, the leading\r\nmissionary in the island, performed the service. The chapel consisted\r\nof a large airy framework of wood; and it was filled to excess by tidy,\r\nclean people, of all ages and both sexes. I was rather disappointed in\r\nthe apparent degree of attention; but I believe my expectations were\r\nraised too high. At all events the appearance was quite equal to that\r\nin a country church in England. The singing of the hymns was decidedly\r\nvery pleasing, but the language from the pulpit, although fluently\r\ndelivered, did not sound well: a constant repetition of words, like\r\n“_tata ta, mata mai,_” rendered it monotonous. After English service, a\r\nparty returned on foot to Matavai. It was a pleasant walk, sometimes\r\nalong the sea-beach and sometimes under the shade of the many beautiful\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\nAbout two years ago, a small vessel under English colours was plundered\r\nby some of the inhabitants of the Low Islands, which were then under\r\nthe dominion of the Queen of Tahiti. It was believed that the\r\nperpetrators were instigated to this act by some indiscreet laws issued\r\nby her majesty. The British government demanded compensation; which was\r\nacceded to, and a sum of nearly three thousand dollars was agreed to be\r\npaid on the first of last September. The Commodore at Lima ordered\r\nCaptain Fitz Roy to inquire concerning this debt, and to demand\r\nsatisfaction if it were not paid. Captain Fitz Roy accordingly\r\nrequested an interview with the Queen Pomarre, since famous from the\r\nill-treatment she has received from the French; and a parliament was\r\nheld to consider the question, at which all the principal chiefs of the\r\nisland and the queen were assembled. I will not attempt to describe\r\nwhat took place, after the interesting account given by Captain Fitz\r\nRoy. The money, it appeared, had not been paid; perhaps the alleged\r\nreasons were rather equivocal; but otherwise I cannot sufficiently\r\nexpress our general surprise at the extreme good sense, the reasoning\r\npowers, moderation, candour, and prompt resolution, which were\r\ndisplayed on all sides. I believe we all left the\r\nmeeting with a very different opinion of the Tahitians from what we\r\nentertained when we entered. The chiefs and people resolved to\r\nsubscribe and complete the sum which was wanting; Captain Fitz Roy\r\nurged that it was hard that their private property should be sacrificed\r\nfor the crimes of distant islanders. They replied that they were\r\ngrateful for his consideration, but that Pomarre was their Queen, and\r\nthat they were determined to help her in this her difficulty. This\r\nresolution and its prompt execution, for a book was opened early the\r\nnext morning, made a perfect conclusion to this very remarkable scene\r\nof loyalty and good feeling.\r\n\r\nAfter the main discussion was ended, several of the chiefs took the\r\nopportunity of asking Captain Fitz Roy many intelligent questions on\r\ninternational customs and laws, relating to the treatment of ships and\r\nforeigners. On some points, as soon as the decision was made, the law\r\nwas issued verbally on the spot. This Tahitian parliament lasted for\r\nseveral hours; and when it was over Captain Fitz Roy invited Queen\r\nPomarre to pay the _Beagle_ a visit.\r\n\r\n\r\n_November_ 25_th._—In the evening four boats were sent for her majesty;\r\nthe ship was dressed with flags, and the yards manned on her coming on\r\nboard. She was accompanied by most of the chiefs. The behaviour of all\r\nwas very proper: they begged for nothing, and seemed much pleased with\r\nCaptain Fitz Roy’s presents. The Queen is a large awkward woman,\r\nwithout any beauty, grace or dignity. She has only one royal attribute:\r\na perfect immovability of expression under all circumstances, and that\r\nrather a sullen one. The rockets were most admired, and a deep “Oh!”\r\ncould be heard from the shore, all round the dark bay, after each\r\nexplosion. The sailors’ songs were also much admired; and the queen\r\nsaid she thought that one of the most boisterous ones certainly could\r\nnot be a hymn! The royal party did not return on shore till past\r\nmidnight.\r\n\r\n\r\n26_th._—In the evening, with a gentle land-breeze, a course was steered\r\nfor New Zealand; and as the sun set, we had a farewell view of the\r\nmountains of Tahiti—the island to which every voyager has offered up\r\nhis tribute of admiration.\r\n\r\n\r\n_December_ 19_th._—In the evening we saw in the distance New Zealand.\r\nWe may now consider that we have nearly crossed the Pacific. It is\r\nnecessary to sail over this great ocean to comprehend its immensity.\r\nMoving quickly onwards for weeks together, we meet with nothing but the\r\nsame blue, profoundly deep, ocean. Even within the archipelagoes, the\r\nislands are mere specks, and far distant one from the other. Accustomed\r\nto look at maps drawn on a small scale, where dots, shading, and names\r\nare crowded together, we do not rightly judge how infinitely small the\r\nproportion of dry land is to the water of this vast expanse. The\r\nmeridian of the Antipodes has likewise been passed; and now every\r\nleague, it made us happy to think, was one league nearer to England.\r\nThese Antipodes call to one’s mind old recollections of childish doubt\r\nand wonder. Only the other day I looked forward to this airy barrier as\r\na definite point in our voyage homewards; but now I find it, and all\r\nsuch resting-places for the imagination, are like shadows, which a man\r\nmoving onwards cannot catch. A gale of wind lasting for some days has\r\nlately given us full leisure to measure the future stages in our\r\nhomeward voyage, and to wish most earnestly for its termination.\r\n\r\n\r\n_December_ 21_st._—Early in the morning we entered the Bay of Islands,\r\nand being becalmed for some hours near the mouth, we did not reach the\r\nanchorage till the middle of the day. The country is hilly, with a\r\nsmooth outline, and is deeply intersected by numerous arms of the sea\r\nextending from the bay. The surface appears from a distance as if\r\nclothed with coarse pasture, but this in truth is nothing but fern. On\r\nthe more distant hills, as well as in parts of the valleys, there is a\r\ngood deal of woodland. The general tint of the landscape is not a\r\nbright green; and it resembles the country a short distance to the\r\nsouth of Concepcion in Chile. In several parts of the bay little\r\nvillages of square tidy-looking houses are scattered close down to the\r\nwater’s edge. Three whaling-ships were lying at anchor, and a canoe\r\nevery now and then crossed from shore to shore; with these exceptions,\r\nan air of extreme quietness reigned over the whole district. Only a\r\nsingle canoe came alongside. This, and the aspect of the whole scene,\r\nafforded a remarkable, and not very pleasing contrast, with our joyful\r\nand boisterous welcome at Tahiti.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon we went on shore to one of the larger groups of\r\nhouses, which yet hardly deserves the title of a village. Its name is\r\nPahia: it is the residence of the missionaries; and there are no native\r\nresidents except servants and labourers. In the vicinity of the Bay of\r\nIslands the number of Englishmen, including their families, amounts to\r\nbetween two and three hundred. All the cottages, many of which are\r\nwhitewashed and look very neat, are the property of the English. The\r\nhovels of the natives are so diminutive and paltry that they can\r\nscarcely be perceived from a distance. At Pahia it was quite pleasing\r\nto behold the English flowers in the gardens before the houses; there\r\nwere roses of several kinds, honeysuckle, jasmine, stocks, and whole\r\nhedges of sweetbriar.\r\n\r\n\r\n_December_ 22_nd._—In the morning I went out walking; but I soon found\r\nthat the country was very impracticable. All the hills are thickly\r\ncovered with tall fern, together with a low bush which grows like a\r\ncypress; and very little ground has been cleared or cultivated. I then\r\ntried the sea-beach; but proceeding towards either hand, my walk was\r\nsoon stopped by salt-water creeks and deep brooks. The communication\r\nbetween the inhabitants of the different parts of the bay is (as in\r\nChiloe) almost entirely kept up by boats. I was surprised to find that\r\nalmost every hill which I ascended had been at some former time more or\r\nless fortified. The summits were cut into steps or successive terraces,\r\nand frequently they had been protected by deep trenches. I afterwards\r\nobserved that the principal hills inland in like manner showed an\r\nartificial outline. These are the Pas, so frequently mentioned by\r\nCaptain Cook under the name of “hippah;” the difference of sound being\r\nowing to the prefixed article.\r\n\r\nThat the Pas had formerly been much used was evident from the piles of\r\nshells, and the pits in which, as I was informed, sweet potatoes used\r\nto be kept as a reserve. As there was no water on these hills, the\r\ndefenders could never have anticipated a long siege, but only a hurried\r\nattack for plunder, against which the successive terraces would have\r\nafforded good protection. The general introduction of firearms has\r\nchanged the whole system of warfare; and an exposed situation on the\r\ntop of a hill is now worse than useless. The Pas in consequence are, at\r\nthe present day, always built on a level piece of ground. They consist\r\nof a double stockade of thick and tall posts, placed in a zigzag line,\r\nso that every part can be flanked. Within the stockade a mound of earth\r\nis thrown up, behind which the defenders can rest in safety, or use\r\ntheir firearms over it. On the level of the ground little archways\r\nsometimes pass through this breastwork, by which means the defenders\r\ncan crawl out to the stockade and reconnoitre their enemies. The\r\nReverend W. Williams, who gave me this account, added that in one Pas\r\nhe had noticed spurs or buttresses projecting on the inner and\r\nprotected side of the mound of earth. On asking the chief the use of\r\nthem, he replied, that if two or three of his men were shot their\r\nneighbours would not see the bodies, and so be discouraged.\r\n\r\nThese Pas are considered by the New Zealanders as very perfect means of\r\ndefence: for the attacking force is never so well disciplined as to\r\nrush in a body to the stockade, cut it down, and effect their entry.\r\nWhen a tribe goes to war, the chief cannot order one party to go here\r\nand another there; but every man fights in the manner which best\r\npleases himself; and to each separate individual to approach a stockade\r\ndefended by firearms must appear certain death. I should think a more\r\nwarlike race of inhabitants could not be found in any part of the world\r\nthan the New Zealanders. Their conduct on first seeing a ship, as\r\ndescribed by Captain Cook, strongly illustrates this: the act of\r\nthrowing volleys of stones at so great and novel an object, and their\r\ndefiance of “Come on shore and we will kill and eat you all,” shows\r\nuncommon boldness. This warlike spirit is evident in many of their\r\ncustoms, and even in their smallest actions. If a New Zealander is\r\nstruck, although but in joke, the blow must be returned; and of this I\r\nsaw an instance with one of our officers.\r\n\r\nAt the present day, from the progress of civilisation, there is much\r\nless warfare, except among some of the southern tribes. I heard a\r\ncharacteristic anecdote of what took place some time ago in the south.\r\nA missionary found a chief and his tribe in\r\npreparation for war;—their muskets clean and bright, and their\r\nammunition ready. He reasoned long on the inutility of the war, and the\r\nlittle provocation which had been given for it. The chief was much\r\nshaken in his resolution, and seemed in doubt: but at length it\r\noccurred to him that a barrel of his gunpowder was in a bad state, and\r\nthat it would not keep much longer. This was brought forward as an\r\nunanswerable argument for the necessity of immediately declaring war:\r\nthe idea of allowing so much good gunpowder to spoil was not to be\r\nthought of; and this settled the point. I was told by the missionaries\r\nthat in the life of Shongi, the chief who visited England, the love of\r\nwar was the one and lasting spring of every action. The tribe in which\r\nhe was a principal chief had at one time been much oppressed by another\r\ntribe from the Thames River. A solemn oath was taken by the men that\r\nwhen their boys should grow up, and they should be powerful enough,\r\nthey would never forget or forgive these injuries. To fulfil this oath\r\nappears to have been Shongi’s chief motive for going to England; and\r\nwhen there it was his sole object. Presents were valued only as they\r\ncould be converted into arms; of the arts, those alone interested him\r\nwhich were connected with the manufacture of arms. When at Sydney,\r\nShongi, by a strange coincidence, met the hostile chief of the Thames\r\nRiver at the house of Mr. Marsden: their conduct was civil to each\r\nother; but Shongi told him that when again in New Zealand he would\r\nnever cease to carry war into his country. The challenge was accepted;\r\nand Shongi on his return fulfilled the threat to the utmost letter. The\r\ntribe on the Thames River was utterly overthrown, and the chief to whom\r\nthe challenge had been given was himself killed. Shongi, although\r\nharbouring such deep feelings of hatred and revenge, is described as\r\nhaving been a good-natured person.\r\n\r\nIn the evening I went with Captain Fitz Roy and Mr. Baker, one of the\r\nmissionaries, to pay a visit to Kororadika: we wandered about the\r\nvillage, and saw and conversed with many of the people, both men,\r\nwomen, and children. Looking at the New Zealander, one naturally\r\ncompares him with the Tahitian; both belonging to the same family of\r\nmankind. The comparison, however, tells heavily against the New\r\nZealander. He may, perhaps be superior in energy, but in\r\nevery other respect his character is of a much lower order. One glance\r\nat their respective expressions brings conviction to the mind that one\r\nis a savage, the other a civilised man. It would be vain to seek in the\r\nwhole of New Zealand a person with the face and mien of the old\r\nTahitian chief Utamme. No doubt the extraordinary manner in which\r\ntattooing is here practised gives a disagreeable expression to their\r\ncountenances. The complicated but symmetrical figures covering the\r\nwhole face puzzle and mislead an unaccustomed eye: it is moreover\r\nprobable that the deep incisions, by destroying the play of the\r\nsuperficial muscles, give an air of rigid inflexibility. But, besides\r\nthis, there is a twinkling in the eye which cannot indicate anything\r\nbut cunning and ferocity. Their figures are tall and bulky; but not\r\ncomparable in elegance with those of the working-classes in Tahiti.\r\n\r\nBoth their persons and houses are filthily dirty and offensive: the\r\nidea of washing either their bodies or their clothes never seems to\r\nenter their heads. I saw a chief, who was wearing a shirt black and\r\nmatted with filth, and when asked how it came to be so dirty, he\r\nreplied, with surprise, “Do not you see it is an old one?” Some of the\r\nmen have shirts; but the common dress is one or two large blankets,\r\ngenerally black with dirt, which are thrown over their shoulders in a\r\nvery inconvenient and awkward fashion. A few of the principal chiefs\r\nhave decent suits of English clothes; but these are only worn on great\r\noccasions.\r\n\r\n\r\n_December_ 23_rd._—At a place called Waimate, about fifteen miles from\r\nthe Bay of Islands, and midway between the eastern and western coasts,\r\nthe missionaries have purchased some land for agricultural purposes. I\r\nhad been introduced to the Reverend W. Williams, who, upon my\r\nexpressing a wish, invited me to pay him a visit there. Mr. Bushby, the\r\nBritish resident, offered to take me in his boat by a creek, where I\r\nshould see a pretty waterfall, and by which means my walk would be\r\nshortened. He likewise procured for me a guide. Upon asking a\r\nneighbouring chief to recommend a man, the chief himself offered to go;\r\nbut his ignorance of the value of money was so complete, that at first\r\nhe asked how many pounds I would give him, but afterwards was well\r\ncontented\r\nwith two dollars. When I showed the chief a very small bundle which I\r\nwanted carried, it became absolutely necessary for him to take a slave.\r\nThese feelings of pride are beginning to wear away; but formerly a\r\nleading man would sooner have died than undergone the indignity of\r\ncarrying the smallest burden. My companion was a light active man,\r\ndressed in a dirty blanket, and with his face completely tattooed. He\r\nhad formerly been a great warrior. He appeared to be on very cordial\r\nterms with Mr. Bushby; but at various times they had quarrelled\r\nviolently. Mr. Bushby remarked that a little quiet irony would\r\nfrequently silence any one of these natives in their most blustering\r\nmoments. This chief has come and harangued Mr. Bushby in a hectoring\r\nmanner, saying, “A great chief, a great man, a friend of mine, has come\r\nto pay me a visit—you must give him something good to eat, some fine\r\npresents, etc.” Mr. Bushby has allowed him to finish his discourse, and\r\nthen has quietly replied by some answer such as, “What else shall your\r\nslave do for you?” The man would then instantly, with a very comical\r\nexpression, cease his braggadocio.\r\n\r\nSome time ago Mr. Bushby suffered a far more serious attack. A chief\r\nand a party of men tried to break into his house in the middle of the\r\nnight, and not finding this so easy, commenced a brisk firing with\r\ntheir muskets. Mr. Bushby was slightly wounded, but the party was at\r\nlength driven away. Shortly afterwards it was discovered who was the\r\naggressor; and a general meeting of the chiefs was convened to consider\r\nthe case. It was considered by the New Zealanders as very atrocious,\r\ninasmuch as it was a night attack, and that Mrs. Bushby was lying ill\r\nin the house: this latter circumstance, much to their honour, being\r\nconsidered in all cases as a protection. The chiefs agreed to\r\nconfiscate the land of the aggressor to the King of England. The whole\r\nproceeding, however, in thus trying and punishing a chief was entirely\r\nwithout precedent. The aggressor, moreover, lost caste in the\r\nestimation of his equals; and this was considered by the British as of\r\nmore consequence than the confiscation of his land.\r\n\r\nAs the boat was shoving off, a second chief stepped into her, who only\r\nwanted the amusement of the passage up and down the creek. I never saw\r\na more horrid and ferocious\r\nexpression than this man had. It immediately struck me I had somewhere\r\nseen his likeness: it will be found in Retzch’s outlines to Schiller’s\r\nballad of Fridolin, where two men are pushing Robert into the burning\r\niron furnace. It is the man who has his arm on Robert’s breast.\r\nPhysiognomy here spoke the truth; this chief had been a notorious\r\nmurderer, and was an arrant coward to boot. At the point where the boat\r\nlanded, Mr. Bushby accompanied me a few hundred yards on the road: I\r\ncould not help admiring the cool impudence of the hoary old villain,\r\nwhom we left lying in the boat, when he shouted to Mr. Bushby, “Do not\r\nyou stay long, I shall be tired of waiting here.”\r\n\r\nWe now commenced our walk. The road lay along a well-beaten path,\r\nbordered on each side by the tall fern which covers the whole country.\r\nAfter travelling some miles we came to a little country village, where\r\na few hovels were collected together, and some patches of ground\r\ncultivated with potatoes. The introduction of the potato has been the\r\nmost essential benefit to the island; it is now much more used than any\r\nnative vegetable. New Zealand is favoured by one great natural\r\nadvantage; namely, that the inhabitants can never perish from famine.\r\nThe whole country abounds with fern: and the roots of this plant, if\r\nnot very palatable, yet contain much nutriment. A native can always\r\nsubsist on these, and on the shell-fish which are abundant on all parts\r\nof the sea-coast. The villages are chiefly conspicuous by the platforms\r\nwhich are raised on four posts ten or twelve feet above the ground, and\r\non which the produce of the fields is kept secure from all accidents.\r\n\r\nOn coming near one of the huts I was much amused by seeing in due form\r\nthe ceremony of rubbing, or, as it ought to be called, pressing noses.\r\nThe women, on our first approach, began uttering something in a most\r\ndolorous voice; they then squatted themselves down and held up their\r\nfaces; my companion standing over them, one after another, placed the\r\nbridge of his nose at right angles to theirs, and commenced pressing.\r\nThis lasted rather longer than a cordial shake of the hand with us, and\r\nas we vary the force of the grasp of the hand in shaking, so do they in\r\npressing. During the process they uttered comfortable little grunts,\r\nvery much in the same manner as two pigs do, when rubbing against each\r\nother. I noticed that the\r\nslave would press noses with any one he met, indifferently either\r\nbefore or after his master the chief. Although among these savages the\r\nchief has absolute power of life and death over his slave, yet there is\r\nan entire absence of ceremony between them. Mr. Burchell has remarked\r\nthe same thing in Southern Africa with the rude Bachapins. Where\r\ncivilisation has arrived at a certain point, complex formalities soon\r\narise between the different grades of society: thus at Tahiti all were\r\nformerly obliged to uncover themselves as low as the waist in presence\r\nof the king.\r\n\r\nThe ceremony of pressing noses having been duly completed with all\r\npresent, we seated ourselves in a circle in the front of one of\r\nthe hovels, and rested there half an hour. All the hovels have nearly\r\nthe same form and dimensions, and all agree in being filthily dirty.\r\nThey resemble a cow-shed with one end open, but having a partition a\r\nlittle way within, with a square hole in it, making a small gloomy\r\nchamber. In this the inhabitants keep all their property, and when the\r\nweather is cold they sleep there. They eat, however, and pass their\r\ntime in the open part in front. My guides having finished their pipes,\r\nwe continued our walk. The path led through the same undulating\r\ncountry, the whole uniformly clothed as before with fern. On our right\r\nhand we had a serpentine river, the banks of which were fringed with\r\ntrees, and here and there on the hill-sides there was a clump of wood.\r\nThe whole scene, in spite of its green colour, had rather a desolate\r\naspect. The sight of so much fern impresses the mind with an idea of\r\nsterility: this, however, is not correct; for wherever the fern grows\r\nthick and breast-high, the land by tillage becomes productive. Some of\r\nthe residents think that all this extensive open country originally was\r\ncovered with forests, and that it has been cleared by fire. It is said,\r\nthat by digging in the barest spots, lumps of the kind of resin which\r\nflows from the kauri pine are frequently found. The natives had an\r\nevident motive in clearing the country; for the fern, formerly a staple\r\narticle of food, flourishes only in the open cleared tracks. The almost\r\nentire absence of associated grasses, which forms so remarkable a\r\nfeature in the vegetation of this island, may perhaps be accounted for\r\nby the land having been aboriginally covered with forest-trees.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe soil is volcanic; in several parts we passed over slaggy lavas, and\r\ncraters could clearly be distinguished on several of the neighbouring\r\nhills. Although the scenery is nowhere beautiful, and only occasionally\r\npretty, I enjoyed my walk. I should have enjoyed it more, if my\r\ncompanion, the chief, had not possessed extraordinary conversational\r\npowers. I knew only three words: “good,” “bad,” and “yes:” and with\r\nthese I answered all his remarks, without of course having understood\r\none word he said. This, however, was quite sufficient: I was a good\r\nlistener, an agreeable person, and he never ceased talking to me.\r\n\r\nAt length we reached Waimate. After having passed over so many miles of\r\nan uninhabited useless country, the sudden appearance of an English\r\nfarm-house, and its well-dressed fields, placed there as if by an\r\nenchanter’s wand, was exceedingly pleasant. Mr. Williams not being at\r\nhome, I received in Mr. Davies’s house a cordial welcome. After\r\ndrinking tea with his family party, we took a stroll about the farm. At\r\nWaimate there are three large houses, where the missionary gentlemen,\r\nMessrs. Williams, Davies, and Clarke, reside; and near them are the\r\nhuts of the native labourers. On an adjoining slope fine crops of\r\nbarley and wheat were standing in full ear; and in another part fields\r\nof potatoes and clover. But I cannot attempt to describe all I saw;\r\nthere were large gardens, with every fruit and vegetable which England\r\nproduces; and many belonging to a warmer clime. I may instance\r\nasparagus, kidney beans, cucumbers, rhubarb, apples, pears, figs,\r\npeaches, apricots, grapes, olives, gooseberries, currants, hops, gorse\r\nfor fences, and English oaks; also many kinds of flowers. Around the\r\nfarmyard there were stables, a thrashing-barn with its winnowing\r\nmachine, a blacksmith’s forge, and on the ground ploughshares and other\r\ntools: in the middle was that happy mixture of pigs and poultry, lying\r\ncomfortably together, as in every English farmyard. At the distance of\r\na few hundred yards, where the water of a little rill had been dammed\r\nup into a pool, there was a large and substantial water-mill.\r\n\r\nAll this is very surprising when it is considered that five years ago\r\nnothing but the fern flourished here. Moreover, native workmanship,\r\ntaught by the missionaries, has effected\r\nthis change;—the lesson of the missionary is the enchanter’s wand. The\r\nhouse had been built, the windows framed, the fields ploughed, and even\r\nthe trees grafted, by the New Zealander. At the mill a New Zealander\r\nwas seen powdered white with flower, like his brother miller in\r\nEngland. When I looked at this whole scene I thought it admirable. It\r\nwas not merely that England was brought vividly before my mind; yet, as\r\nthe evening drew to a close, the domestic sounds, the fields of corn,\r\nthe distant undulating country with its trees, might well have been\r\nmistaken for our fatherland: nor was it the triumphant feeling at\r\nseeing what Englishmen could effect, but rather the high hopes thus\r\ninspired for the future progress of this fine island.\r\n\r\nSeveral young men, redeemed by the missionaries from slavery, were\r\nemployed on the farm. They were dressed in a shirt, jacket, and\r\ntrousers, and had a respectable appearance. Judging from one trifling\r\nanecdote, I should think they must be honest. When walking in the\r\nfields, a young labourer came up to Mr. Davies and gave him a knife and\r\ngimlet, saying that he had found them on the road, and did not know to\r\nwhom they belonged! These young men and boys appeared very merry and\r\ngood-humoured. In the evening I saw a party of them at cricket: when I\r\nthought of the austerity of which the missionaries have been accused, I\r\nwas amused by observing one of their own sons taking an active part in\r\nthe game. A more decided and pleasing change was manifested in the\r\nyoung women, who acted as servants within the houses. Their clean,\r\ntidy, and healthy appearance, like that of the dairy-maids in England,\r\nformed a wonderful contrast with the women of the filthy hovels in\r\nKororadika. The wives of the missionaries tried to persuade them not to\r\nbe tattooed; but a famous operator having arrived from the south, they\r\nsaid, “We really must just have a few lines on our lips; else when we\r\ngrow old, our lips will shrivel, and we shall be so very ugly.” There\r\nis not nearly so much tattooing as formerly; but as it is a badge of\r\ndistinction between the chief and the slave, it will probably long be\r\npractised. So soon does any train of ideas become habitual, that the\r\nmissionaries told me that even in their eyes a plain face looked mean,\r\nand not like that of a New Zealand gentleman.\r\n\r\n\r\nLate in the evening I went to Mr. Williams’s house, where I passed the\r\nnight. I found there a large party of children, collected together for\r\nChristmas Day, and all sitting round a table at tea. I never saw a\r\nnicer or more merry group; and to think that this was in the centre of\r\nthe land of cannibalism, murder, and all atrocious crimes! The\r\ncordiality and happiness so plainly pictured in the faces of the little\r\ncircle appeared equally felt by the older persons of the mission.\r\n\r\n\r\n_December_ 24_th._—In the morning prayers were read in the native\r\ntongue to the whole family. After breakfast I rambled about the gardens\r\nand farm. This was a market-day, when the natives of the surrounding\r\nhamlets bring their potatoes, Indian corn, or pigs, to exchange for\r\nblankets, tobacco, and sometimes, through the persuasions of the\r\nmissionaries, for soap. Mr. Davies’s eldest son, who manages a farm of\r\nhis own, is the man of business in the market. The children of the\r\nmissionaries, who came while young to the island, understand the\r\nlanguage better than their parents, and can get anything more readily\r\ndone by the natives.\r\n\r\nA little before noon Messrs. Williams and Davies walked with me to part\r\nof a neighbouring forest, to show me the famous kauri pine. I measured\r\none of these noble trees, and found it thirty-one feet in circumference\r\nabove the roots. There was another close by, which I did not see,\r\nthirty-three feet; and I heard of one no less than forty feet. These\r\ntrees are remarkable for their smooth cylindrical boles, which run up\r\nto a height of sixty, and even ninety feet, with a nearly equal\r\ndiameter, and without a single branch. The crown of branches at the\r\nsummit is out of all proportion small to the trunk; and the leaves are\r\nlikewise small compared with the branches. The forest was here almost\r\ncomposed of the kauri; and the largest trees, from the parallelism of\r\ntheir sides, stood up like gigantic columns of wood. The timber of the\r\nkauri is the most valuable production of the island; moreover, a\r\nquantity of resin oozes from the bark, which is sold at a penny a pound\r\nto the Americans, but its use was then unknown. Some of the New Zealand\r\nforests must be impenetrable to an extraordinary degree. Mr. Matthews\r\ninformed me that one forest only thirty-four miles in width, and\r\nseparating two inhabited\r\ndistricts, had only lately, for the first time, been crossed. He and\r\nanother missionary, each with a party of about fifty men, undertook to\r\nopen a road, but it cost them more than a fortnight’s labour! In the\r\nwoods I saw very few birds. With regard to animals, it is a most\r\nremarkable fact, that so large an island, extending over more than 700\r\nmiles in latitude, and in many parts ninety broad, with varied\r\nstations, a fine climate, and land of all heights, from 14,000 feet\r\ndownwards, with the exception of a small rat, did not possess one\r\nindigenous animal. The several species of that gigantic genus of birds,\r\nthe Deinornis, seem here to have replaced mammiferous quadrupeds, in\r\nthe same manner as the reptiles still do at the Galapagos Archipelago.\r\nIt is said that the common Norway rat, in the short space of two years,\r\nannihilated in this northern end of the island the New Zealand species.\r\nIn many places I noticed several sorts of weeds, which, like the rats,\r\nI was forced to own as countrymen. A leek has overrun whole districts,\r\nand will prove very troublesome, but it was imported as a favour by a\r\nFrench vessel. The common dock is also widely disseminated, and will, I\r\nfear, for ever remain a proof of the rascality of an Englishman who\r\nsold the seeds for those of the tobacco plant.\r\n\r\nOn returning from our pleasant walk to the house, I dined with Mr.\r\nWilliams; and then, a horse being lent me, I returned to the Bay of\r\nIslands. I took leave of the missionaries with thankfulness for their\r\nkind welcome, and with feelings of high respect for their\r\ngentlemanlike, useful, and upright characters. I think it would be\r\ndifficult to find a body of men better adapted for the high office\r\nwhich they fulfil.\r\n\r\n_Christmas Day._—In a few more days the fourth year of our absence from\r\nEngland will be completed. Our first Christmas Day was spent at\r\nPlymouth, the second at St. Martin’s Cove near Cape Horn; the third at\r\nPort Desire in Patagonia; the fourth at anchor in a wild harbour in the\r\npeninsula of Tres Montes, this fifth here, and the next, I trust in\r\nProvidence, will be in England. We attended divine service in the\r\nchapel of Pahia; part of the service being read in English, and part in\r\nthe native language. Whilst at New Zealand we did not hear of any\r\nrecent acts of cannibalism; but\r\nMr. Stokes found burnt human bones strewed round a fireplace on a small\r\nisland near the anchorage; but these remains of a comfortable banquet\r\nmight have been lying there for several years. It is probable that the\r\nmoral state of the people will rapidly improve. Mr. Bushby mentioned\r\none pleasing anecdote as a proof of the sincerity of some, at least, of\r\nthose who profess Christianity. One of his young men left him, who had\r\nbeen accustomed to read prayers to the rest of the servants. Some weeks\r\nafterwards, happening to pass late in the evening by an outhouse, he\r\nsaw and heard one of his men reading the Bible with difficulty by the\r\nlight of the fire, to the others. After this the party knelt and\r\nprayed: in their prayers they mentioned Mr. Bushby and his family, and\r\nthe missionaries, each separately in his respective district.\r\n\r\n\r\n_December_ 26_th._—Mr. Bushby offered to take Mr. Sulivan and myself in\r\nhis boat some miles up the river to Cawa-Cawa, and proposed afterwards\r\nto walk on to the village of Waiomio, where there are some curious\r\nrocks. Following one of the arms of the bay we enjoyed a pleasant row,\r\nand passed through pretty scenery, until we came to a village, beyond\r\nwhich the boat could not pass. From this place a chief and a party of\r\nmen volunteered to walk with us to Waiomio, a distance of four miles.\r\nThe chief was at this time rather notorious from having lately hung one\r\nof his wives and a slave for adultery. When one of the missionaries\r\nremonstrated with him he seemed surprised, and said he thought he was\r\nexactly following the English method. Old Shongi, who happened to be in\r\nEngland during the Queen’s trial, expressed great disapprobation at the\r\nwhole proceeding: he said he had five wives, and he would rather cut\r\noff all their heads than be so much troubled about one. Leaving this\r\nvillage, we crossed over to another, seated on a hill-side at a little\r\ndistance. The daughter of a chief, who was still a heathen, had died\r\nthere five days before. The hovel in which she had expired had been\r\nburnt to the ground: her body, being enclosed between two small canoes,\r\nwas placed upright on the ground, and protected by an enclosure bearing\r\nwooden images of their gods, and the whole was painted bright red, so\r\nas to be conspicuous from afar. Her gown was fastened to the coffin,\r\nand her hair being cut off was cast at\r\nits foot. The relatives of the family had torn the flesh of their arms,\r\nbodies, and faces, so that they were covered with clotted blood; and\r\nthe old women looked most filthy, disgusting objects. On the following\r\nday some of the officers visited this place, and found the women still\r\nhowling and cutting themselves.\r\n\r\nWe continued our walk, and soon reached Waiomio. Here there are some\r\nsingular masses of limestone resembling ruined castles. These rocks\r\nhave long served for burial places, and in consequence are held too\r\nsacred to be approached. One of the young men, however, cried out, “Let\r\nus all be brave,” and ran on ahead; but when within a hundred yards,\r\nthe whole party thought better of it, and stopped short. With perfect\r\nindifference, however, they allowed us to examine the whole place. At\r\nthis village we rested some hours, during which time there was a long\r\ndiscussion with Mr. Bushby, concerning the right of sale of certain\r\nlands. One old man, who appeared a perfect genealogist, illustrated the\r\nsuccessive possessors by bits of stick driven into the ground. Before\r\nleaving the houses a little basketful of roasted sweet potatoes was\r\ngiven to each of our party; and we all, according to the custom,\r\ncarried them away to eat on the road. I noticed that among the women\r\nemployed in cooking, there was a man-slave: it must be a humiliating\r\nthing for a man in this warlike country to be employed in doing that\r\nwhich is considered as the lowest woman’s work. Slaves are not allowed\r\nto go to war; but this perhaps can hardly be considered as a hardship.\r\nI heard of one poor wretch who, during hostilities, ran away to the\r\nopposite party; being met by two men, he was immediately seized; but as\r\nthey could not agree to whom he should belong, each stood over him with\r\na stone hatchet, and seemed determined that the other at least should\r\nnot take him away alive. The poor man, almost dead with fright, was\r\nonly saved by the address of a chief’s wife. We afterwards enjoyed a\r\npleasant walk back to the boat, but did not reach the ship till late in\r\nthe evening.\r\n\r\n\r\n_December_ 30_th._—In the afternoon we stood out of the Bay of Islands,\r\non our course to Sydney. I believe we were all glad to leave New\r\nZealand. It is not a pleasant place.\r\nAmongst the natives there is absent that charming simplicity which is\r\nfound in Tahiti; and the greater part of the English are the very\r\nrefuse of society. Neither is the country itself attractive. I look\r\nback but to one bright spot, and that is Waimate, with its Christian\r\ninhabitants.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Hippah, New Zealand]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sydney, 1835]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIX\r\n\r\n\r\nAUSTRALIA\r\n\r\nSydney—Excursion to Bathurst—Aspect of the woods—Party of\r\nnatives—Gradual extinction of the aborigines—Infection generated by\r\nassociated men in health—Blue Mountains—View of the grand gulf-like\r\nvalleys—Their origin and formation—Bathurst, general civility of the\r\nlower orders—State of society—Van Diemen’s Land—Hobart Town—Aborigines\r\nall banished—Mount Wellington—King George’s Sound—Cheerless aspect of\r\nthe country—Bald Head, calcareous casts of branches of trees—Party of\r\nnatives—Leave Australia.\r\n\r\n_January_ 12_th_, 1836.—Early in the morning a light air carried us\r\ntowards the entrance of Port Jackson. Instead of beholding a verdant\r\ncountry, interspersed with fine houses, a straight line of yellowish\r\ncliff brought to our minds the coast of Patagonia. A solitary\r\nlighthouse, built of white stone, alone told us that we were near a\r\ngreat and populous city. Having entered the harbour, it appears fine\r\nand spacious, with cliff-formed shores of horizontally stratified\r\nsandstone. The nearly level country is covered with thin scrubby trees,\r\nbespeaking the curse of sterility. Proceeding farther inland, the\r\ncountry improves: beautiful villas and nice cottages are here and there\r\nscattered\r\nalong the beach. In the distance stone houses, two and three stories\r\nhigh, and windmills standing on the edge of a bank, pointed out to us\r\nthe neighbourhood of the capital of Australia.\r\n\r\nAt last we anchored within Sydney Cove. We found the little basin\r\noccupied by many large ships, and surrounded by warehouses. In the\r\nevening I walked through the town, and returned full of admiration at\r\nthe whole scene. It is a most magnificent testimony to the power of the\r\nBritish nation. Here, in a less promising country, scores of years have\r\ndone many more times more than an equal number of centuries have\r\neffected in South America. My first feeling was to congratulate myself\r\nthat I was born an Englishman. Upon seeing more of the town afterwards,\r\nperhaps my admiration fell a little; but yet it is a fine town. The\r\nstreets are regular, broad, clean, and kept in excellent order; the\r\nhouses are of a good size, and the shops well furnished. It may be\r\nfaithfully compared to the large suburbs which stretch out from London\r\nand a few other great towns in England; but not even near London or\r\nBirmingham is there an appearance of such rapid growth. The number of\r\nlarge houses and other buildings just finished was truly surprising;\r\nnevertheless, every one complained of the high rents and difficulty in\r\nprocuring a house. Coming from South America, where in the towns every\r\nman of property is known, no one thing surprised me more than not being\r\nable to ascertain at once to whom this or that carriage belonged.\r\n\r\nI hired a man and two horses to take me to Bathurst, a village about\r\none hundred and twenty miles in the interior, and the centre of a great\r\npastoral district. By this means I hoped to gain a general idea of the\r\nappearance of the country. On the morning of the 16th (January) I set\r\nout on my excursion. The first stage took us to Paramatta, a small\r\ncountry town, next to Sydney in importance. The roads were excellent,\r\nand made upon the MacAdam principle, whinstone having been brought for\r\nthe purpose from the distance of several miles. In all respects there\r\nwas a close resemblance to England: perhaps the alehouses here were\r\nmore numerous. The iron gangs, or parties of convicts who have\r\ncommitted here some offence, appeared the least like England: they were\r\nworking in chains, under the charge of sentries with loaded\r\narms. The power which the government possesses, by means of forced\r\nlabour, of at once opening good roads throughout the country, has been,\r\nI believe, one main cause of the early prosperity of this colony. I\r\nslept at night at a very comfortable inn at Emu ferry, thirty-five\r\nmiles from Sydney, and near the ascent of the Blue Mountains. This line\r\nof road is the most frequented, and has been the longest inhabited of\r\nany in the colony. The whole land is enclosed with high railings, for\r\nthe farmers have not succeeded in rearing hedges. There are many\r\nsubstantial houses and good cottages scattered about; but although\r\nconsiderable pieces of land are under cultivation, the greater part yet\r\nremains as when first discovered.\r\n\r\nThe extreme uniformity of the vegetation is the most remarkable feature\r\nin the landscape of the greater part of New South Wales. Everywhere we\r\nhave an open woodland, the ground being partially covered with a very\r\nthin pasture, with little appearance of verdure. The trees nearly all\r\nbelong to one family, and mostly have their leaves placed in a\r\nvertical, instead of as in Europe, in a nearly horizontal position: the\r\nfoliage is scanty, and of a peculiar pale green tint, without any\r\ngloss. Hence the woods appear light and shadowless: this, although a\r\nloss of comfort to the traveller under the scorching rays of summer, is\r\nof importance to the farmer, as it allows grass to grow where it\r\notherwise would not. The leaves are not shed periodically: this\r\ncharacter appears common to the entire southern hemisphere, namely,\r\nSouth America, Australia, and the Cape of Good Hope. The inhabitants of\r\nthis hemisphere, and of the intertropical regions, thus lose perhaps\r\none of the most glorious, though to our eyes common, spectacles in the\r\nworld—the first bursting into full foliage of the leafless tree. They\r\nmay, however, say that we pay dearly for this by having the land\r\ncovered with mere naked skeletons for so many months. This is too true;\r\nbut our senses thus acquire a keen relish for the exquisite green of\r\nthe spring, which the eyes of those living within the tropics, sated\r\nduring the long year with the gorgeous productions of those glowing\r\nclimates, can never experience. The greater number of the trees, with\r\nthe exception of some of the Blue-gums, do not attain a large size; but\r\nthey grow tall and tolerably straight, and stand well apart. The bark\r\nof some of the Eucalypti falls annually, or\r\nhangs dead in long shreds which swing about with the wind, and give to\r\nthe woods a desolate and untidy appearance. I cannot imagine a more\r\ncomplete contrast, in every respect, than between the forests of\r\nValdivia or Chiloe, and the woods of Australia.\r\n\r\nAt sunset, a party of a score of the black aborigines passed by, each\r\ncarrying, in their accustomed manner, a bundle of spears and other\r\nweapons. By giving a leading young man a shilling, they were easily\r\ndetained, and threw their spears for my amusement. They were all partly\r\nclothed, and several could speak a little English: their countenances\r\nwere good-humoured and pleasant, and they appeared far from being such\r\nutterly degraded beings as they have usually been represented. In their\r\nown arts they are admirable. A cap being fixed at thirty yards\r\ndistance, they transfixed it with a spear, delivered by the\r\nthrowing-stick with the rapidity of an arrow from the bow of a\r\npractised archer. In tracking animals or men they show most wonderful\r\nsagacity; and I heard of several of their remarks which manifested\r\nconsiderable acuteness. They will not, however, cultivate the ground,\r\nor build houses and remain stationary, or even take the trouble of\r\ntending a flock of sheep when given to them. On the whole they appear\r\nto me to stand some few degrees higher in the scale of civilisation\r\nthan the Fuegians.\r\n\r\nIt is very curious thus to see in the midst of a civilised people, a\r\nset of harmless savages wandering about without knowing where they\r\nshall sleep at night, and gaining their livelihood by hunting in the\r\nwoods. As the white man has travelled onwards, he has spread over the\r\ncountry belonging to several tribes. These, although thus enclosed by\r\none common people, keep up their ancient distinctions, and sometimes go\r\nto war with each other. In an engagement which took place lately, the\r\ntwo parties most singularly chose the centre of the village of Bathurst\r\nfor the field of battle. This was of service to the defeated side, for\r\nthe runaway warriors took refuge in the barracks.\r\n\r\nThe number of aborigines is rapidly decreasing. In my whole ride, with\r\nthe exception of some boys brought up by Englishmen, I saw only one\r\nother party. This decrease, no doubt, must be partly owing to the\r\nintroduction of spirits, to\r\nEuropean diseases (even the milder ones of which, such as the\r\nmeasles,[1] prove very destructive), and to the gradual extinction of\r\nthe wild animals. It is said that numbers of their children invariably\r\nperish in very early infancy from the effects of their wandering life;\r\nand as the difficulty of procuring food increases, so must their\r\nwandering habits increase; and hence the population, without any\r\napparent deaths from famine, is repressed in a manner extremely sudden\r\ncompared to what happens in civilised countries, where the father,\r\nthough in adding to his labour he may injure himself, does not destroy\r\nhis offspring.\r\n\r\n [1] It is remarkable how the same disease is modified in different\r\n climates. At the little island of St. Helena the introduction of\r\n scarlet-fever is dreaded as a plague. In some countries foreigners and\r\n natives are as differently affected by certain contagious disorders as\r\n if they had been different animals; of which fact some instances have\r\n occurred in Chile; and, according to Humboldt, in Mexico (_Polit.\r\n Essay, New Spain,_ vol. iv.)\r\n\r\nBesides these several evident causes of destruction, there appears to\r\nbe some more mysterious agency generally at work. Wherever the European\r\nhas trod, death seems to pursue the aboriginal. We may look to the wide\r\nextent of the Americas, Polynesia, the Cape of Good Hope, and\r\nAustralia, and we find the same result. Nor is it the white man alone\r\nthat thus acts the destroyer; the Polynesian of Malay extraction has in\r\nparts of the East Indian archipelago thus driven before him the\r\ndark-coloured native. The varieties of man seem to act on each other in\r\nthe same way as different species of animals—the stronger always\r\nextirpating the weaker. It was melancholy at New Zealand to hear the\r\nfine energetic natives saying that they knew the land was doomed to\r\npass from their children. Every one has heard of the inexplicable\r\nreduction of the population in the beautiful and healthy island of\r\nTahiti since the date of Captain Cook’s voyages: although in that case\r\nwe might have expected that it would have been increased; for\r\ninfanticide, which formerly prevailed to so extraordinary a degree, has\r\nceased, profligacy has greatly diminished, and the murderous wars\r\nbecome less frequent.\r\n\r\nThe Reverend J. Williams, in his interesting work,[2] says that the\r\nfirst intercourse between natives and Europeans “is invariably attended\r\nwith the introduction of fever, dysentery,\r\nor some other disease which carries off numbers of the people.” Again\r\nhe affirms “It is certainly a fact, which cannot be controverted, that\r\nmost of the diseases which have raged in the islands during my\r\nresidence there have been introduced by ships;[3] and what renders this\r\nfact remarkable is that there might be no appearance of disease among\r\nthe crew of the ship which conveyed this destructive importation.” This\r\nstatement is not quite so extraordinary as it at first appears; for\r\nseveral cases are on record of the most malignant fevers having broken\r\nout, although the parties themselves, who were the cause, were not\r\naffected. In the early part of the reign of George III, a prisoner who\r\nhad been confined in a dungeon was taken in a coach with four\r\nconstables before a magistrate; and although the man himself was not\r\nill, the four constables died from a short putrid fever; but the\r\ncontagion extended to no others. From these facts it would almost\r\nappear as if the effluvium of one set of men shut up for some time\r\ntogether was poisonous when inhaled by others; and possibly more so, if\r\nthe men be of different races. Mysterious as this circumstance appears\r\nto be, it is not more surprising than that the body of one’s\r\nfellow-creature, directly after death, and before putrefaction has\r\ncommenced, should often be of so deleterious a quality that the mere\r\npuncture from an instrument used in its dissection should prove fatal.\r\n\r\n [2] _Narrative of Missionary Enterprise,_ p. 282.\r\n\r\n\r\n [3] Captain Beechey (chap. iv, vol. i.) states that the inhabitants of\r\n Pitcairn Island are firmly convinced that after the arrival of every\r\n ship they suffer cutaneous and other disorders. Captain Beechey\r\n attributes this to the change of diet during the time of the visit.\r\n Dr. Macculloch (_Western Isles,_ vol. ii, p. 32) says, “It is\r\n asserted, that on the arrival of a stranger (at St. Kilda) all the\r\n inhabitants, in the common phraseology, catch a cold.” Dr. Macculloch\r\n considers the whole case, although often previously affirmed, as\r\n ludicrous. He adds, however, that “the question was put by us to the\r\n inhabitants who unanimously agreed in the story.” In Vancouver’s\r\n _Voyage_ there is a somewhat similar statement with respect to\r\n Otaheite. Dr. Dieffenbach, in a note to his translation of this\r\n Journal, states that the same fact is universally believed by the\r\n inhabitants of the Chatham Islands and in parts of New Zealand. It is\r\n impossible that such a belief should have become universal in the\r\n northern hemisphere, at the Antipodes, and in the Pacific, without\r\n some good foundation. Humboldt (_Polit. Essay on King. of New Spain,_\r\n vol. iv.) says that the great epidemics at Panama and Callao are\r\n “marked” by the arrival of ships from Chile, because the people from\r\n that temperate region first experience the fatal effects of the torrid\r\n zones. I may add that I have heard it stated in Shropshire that sheep\r\n which have been imported from vessels, although themselves in a\r\n healthy condition, if placed in the same fold with others, frequently\r\n produce sickness in the flock.\r\n\r\n17_th._—Early in the morning we passed the Nepean in a\r\nferry-boat. The river, although at this spot both broad and deep, had a\r\nvery small body of running water. Having crossed a low piece of land on\r\nthe opposite side, we reached the slope of the Blue Mountains. The\r\nascent is not steep, the road having been cut with much care on the\r\nside of a sandstone cliff. On the summit an almost level plain extends,\r\nwhich, rising imperceptibly to the westward, at last attains a height\r\nof more than 3000 feet. From so grand a title as Blue Mountains, and\r\nfrom their absolute altitude, I expected to have seen a bold chain of\r\nmountains crossing the country; but instead of this, a sloping plain\r\npresents merely an inconsiderable front to the low land near the coast.\r\nFrom this first slope the view of the extensive woodland to the east\r\nwas striking, and the surrounding trees grew bold and lofty. But when\r\nonce on the sandstone platform, the scenery becomes exceedingly\r\nmonotonous; each side of the road is bordered by scrubby trees of the\r\nnever-failing Eucalyptus family; and with the exception of two or three\r\nsmall inns, there are no houses or cultivated land; the road, moreover,\r\nis solitary; the most frequent object being a bullock-waggon, piled up\r\nwith bales of wool.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the day we baited our horses at a little inn, called\r\nthe Weatherboard. The country here is elevated 2800 feet above the sea.\r\nAbout a mile and a half from this place there is a view exceedingly\r\nwell worth visiting. Following down a little valley and its tiny rill\r\nof water, an immense gulf unexpectedly opens through the trees which\r\nborder the pathway, at the depth of perhaps 1500 feet. Walking on a few\r\nyards, one stands on the brink of a vast precipice, and below one sees\r\na grand bay or gulf, for I know not what other name to give it, thickly\r\ncovered with forest. The point of view is situated as if at the head of\r\na bay, the line of cliff diverging on each side, and showing headland\r\nbehind headland, as on a bold sea-coast. These cliffs are composed of\r\nhorizontal strata of whitish sandstone; and are so absolutely vertical,\r\nthat in many places a person standing on the edge and throwing down a\r\nstone, can see it strike the trees in the abyss below. So unbroken is\r\nthe line of cliff that in order to reach the foot of the waterfall\r\nformed by this little stream, it is said to be necessary to go sixteen\r\nmiles round. About five miles distant in front another line of cliff\r\nextends, which thus appears completely to encircle\r\nthe valley; and hence the name of bay is justified, as applied to this\r\ngrand amphitheatrical depression. If we imagine a winding harbour, with\r\nits deep water surrounded by bold cliff-like shores, to be laid dry,\r\nand a forest to spring up on its sandy bottom, we should then have the\r\nappearance and structure here exhibited. This kind of view was to me\r\nquite novel, and extremely magnificent.\r\n\r\nIn the evening we reached the Blackheath. The sandstone plateau has\r\nhere attained the height of 3400 feet; and is covered, as before, with\r\nthe same scrubby woods. From the road there were occasional glimpses\r\ninto a profound valley of the same character as the one described; but\r\nfrom the steepness and depth of its sides, the bottom was scarcely ever\r\nto be seen. The Blackheath is a very comfortable inn, kept by an old\r\nsoldier; and it reminded me of the small inns in North Wales.\r\n\r\n18_th._—Very early in the morning I walked about three miles to see\r\nGovett’s Leap: a view of a similar character with that near the\r\nWeatherboard, but perhaps even more stupendous. So early in the day the\r\ngulf was filled with a thin blue haze, which, although destroying the\r\ngeneral effect of the view, added to the apparent depth at which the\r\nforest was stretched out beneath our feet. These valleys, which so long\r\npresented an insuperable barrier to the attempts of the most\r\nenterprising of the colonists to reach the interior, are most\r\nremarkable. Great armlike bays, expanding at their upper ends, often\r\nbranch from the main valleys and penetrate the sandstone platform; on\r\nthe other hand, the platform often sends promontories into the valleys,\r\nand even leaves in them great, almost insulated, masses. To descend\r\ninto some of these valleys, it is necessary to go round twenty miles;\r\nand into others, the surveyors have only lately penetrated, and the\r\ncolonists have not yet been able to drive in their cattle. But the most\r\nremarkable feature in their structure is, that although several miles\r\nwide at their heads, they generally contract towards their mouths to\r\nsuch a degree as to become impassable. The Surveyor-General, Sir T.\r\nMitchell,[4] endeavoured in vain, first walking and then by crawling\r\nbetween the great fallen fragments of sandstone, to\r\nascend through the gorge by which the river Grose joins the Nepean; yet\r\nthe valley of the Grose in its upper part, as I saw, forms a\r\nmagnificent level basin some miles in width, and is on all sides\r\nsurrounded by cliffs, the summits of which are believed to be nowhere\r\nless than 3000 feet above the level of the sea. When cattle are driven\r\ninto the valley of the Wolgan by a path (which I descended), partly\r\nnatural and partly made by the owner of the land, they cannot escape;\r\nfor this valley is in every other part surrounded by perpendicular\r\ncliffs, and eight miles lower down it contracts from an average width\r\nof half a mile, to a mere chasm, impassable to man or beast. Sir T.\r\nMitchell states that the great valley of the Cox river with all its\r\nbranches, contracts, where it unites with the Nepean, into a gorge 2200\r\nyards in width, and about 1000 feet in depth. Other similar cases might\r\nhave been added.\r\n\r\n [4] _Travels in Australia,_ vol. i, p. 154. I must express my\r\n obligation to Sir T. Mitchell for several interesting personal\r\n communications on the subject of these great valleys of New South\r\n Wales.\r\n\r\nThe first impression on seeing the correspondence of the horizontal\r\nstrata on each side of these valleys and great amphitheatrical\r\ndepressions, is that they have been hollowed out, like other valleys,\r\nby the action of water; but when one reflects on the enormous amount of\r\nstone which on this view must have been removed through mere gorges or\r\nchasms, one is led to ask whether these spaces may not have subsided.\r\nBut considering the form of the irregularly branching valleys, and of\r\nthe narrow promontories projecting into them from the platforms, we are\r\ncompelled to abandon this notion. To attribute these hollows to the\r\npresent alluvial action would be preposterous; nor does the drainage\r\nfrom the summit-level always fall, as I remarked near the Weatherboard,\r\ninto the head of these valleys, but into one side of their baylike\r\nrecesses. Some of the inhabitants remarked to me that they never viewed\r\none of those baylike recesses, with the headlands receding on both\r\nhands, without being struck with their resemblance to a bold sea-coast.\r\nThis is certainly the case; moreover, on the present coast of New South\r\nWales, the numerous fine, widely-branching harbours, which are\r\ngenerally connected with the sea by a narrow mouth worn through the\r\nsandstone coast-cliffs, varying from one mile in width to a quarter of\r\na mile, present a likeness, though on a miniature scale, to the great\r\nvalleys of the interior. But then immediately occurs the startling\r\ndifficulty, why has the sea worn out these\r\ngreat though circumscribed depressions on a wide platform, and left\r\nmere gorges at the openings, through which the whole vast amount of\r\ntriturated matter must have been carried away? The only light I can\r\nthrow upon this enigma is by remarking that banks of the most irregular\r\nforms appear to be now forming in some seas, as in parts of the West\r\nIndies and in the Red Sea, and that their sides are exceedingly steep.\r\nSuch banks, I have been led to suppose, have been formed by sediment\r\nheaped by strong currents on an irregular bottom. That in some cases\r\nthe sea, instead of spreading out sediment in a uniform sheet, heaps it\r\nround submarine rocks and islands, it is hardly possible to doubt,\r\nafter examining the charts of the West Indies; and that the waves have\r\npower to form high and precipitous cliffs, even in land-locked\r\nharbours, I have noticed in many parts of South America. To apply these\r\nideas to the sandstone platforms of New South Wales, I imagine that the\r\nstrata were heaped by the action of strong currents, and of the\r\nundulations of an open sea, on an irregular bottom; and that the\r\nvalley-like spaces thus left unfilled had their steeply sloping flanks\r\nworn into cliffs during a slow elevation of the land; the worn-down\r\nsandstone being removed, either at the time when the narrow gorges were\r\ncut by the retreating sea, or subsequently by alluvial action.\r\n\r\n\r\nSoon after leaving the Blackheath we descended from the sandstone\r\nplatform by the pass of Mount Victoria. To effect this pass an enormous\r\nquantity of stone has been cut through; the design and its manner of\r\nexecution being worthy of any line of road in England. We now entered\r\nupon a country less elevated by nearly a thousand feet, and consisting\r\nof granite. With the change of rock the vegetation improved; the trees\r\nwere both finer and stood farther apart; and the pasture between them\r\nwas a little greener and more plentiful. At Hassan’s Walls I left the\r\nhigh-road, and made a short detour to a farm called Walerawang; to the\r\nsuperintendent of which I had a letter of introduction from the owner\r\nin Sydney. Mr. Browne had the kindness to ask me to stay the ensuing\r\nday, which I had much pleasure in doing. This place offers an example\r\nof one of the large farming, or rather sheep-grazing, establishments of\r\nthe colony. Cattle and horses are, however,\r\nin this case rather more numerous than usual, owing to some of the\r\nvalleys being swampy and producing a coarser pasture. Two or three flat\r\npieces of ground near the house were cleared and cultivated with corn,\r\nwhich the harvest-men were now reaping: but no more wheat is sown than\r\nsufficient for the annual support of the labourers employed on the\r\nestablishment. The usual number of assigned convict-servants here is\r\nabout forty, but at the present time there were rather more. Although\r\nthe farm was well stocked with every necessary, there was an apparent\r\nabsence of comfort; and not one single woman resided here. The sunset\r\nof a fine day will generally cast an air of happy contentment on any\r\nscene; but here, at this retired farmhouse, the brightest tints on the\r\nsurrounding woods could not make me forget that forty hardened,\r\nprofligate men were ceasing from their daily labours, like the slaves\r\nfrom Africa, yet without their holy claim for compassion.\r\n\r\nEarly on the next morning Mr. Archer, the joint superintendent, had the\r\nkindness to take me out kangaroo-hunting. We continued riding the\r\ngreater part of the day, but had very bad sport, not seeing a kangaroo,\r\nor even a wild dog. The greyhounds pursued a kangaroo rat into a hollow\r\ntree, out of which we dragged it: it is an animal as large as a rabbit,\r\nbut with the figure of a kangaroo. A few years since this country\r\nabounded with wild animals; but now the emu is banished to a long\r\ndistance, and the kangaroo is become scarce; to both the English\r\ngreyhound has been highly destructive. It may be long before these\r\nanimals are altogether exterminated, but their doom is fixed. The\r\naborigines are always anxious to borrow the dogs from the farmhouses:\r\nthe use of them, the offal when an animal is killed, and some milk from\r\nthe cows, are the peace-offerings of the settlers, who push farther and\r\nfarther towards the interior. The thoughtless aboriginal, blinded by\r\nthese trifling advantages, is delighted at the approach of the white\r\nman, who seems predestined to inherit the country of his children.\r\n\r\nAlthough having poor sport, we enjoyed a pleasant ride. The woodland is\r\ngenerally so open that a person on horseback can gallop through it. It\r\nis traversed by a few flat-bottomed valleys, which are green and free\r\nfrom trees: in such spots the scenery was pretty like that of a park.\r\nIn the whole\r\ncountry I scarcely saw a place without the marks of a fire; whether\r\nthese had been more or less recent—whether the stumps were more or less\r\nblack, was the greatest change which varied the uniformity so wearisome\r\nto the traveller’s eye. In these woods there are not many birds; I saw,\r\nhowever, some large flocks of the white cockatoo feeding in a\r\ncorn-field, and a few most beautiful parrots; crows like our jackdaws\r\nwere not uncommon, and another bird something like the magpie. In the\r\ndusk of the evening I took a stroll along a chain of ponds, which in\r\nthis dry country represented the course of a river, and had the good\r\nfortune to see several of the famous Ornithorhynchus paradoxus. They\r\nwere diving and playing about the surface of the water, but showed so\r\nlittle of their bodies that they might easily have been mistaken for\r\nwater-rats. Mr. Browne shot one: certainly it is a most extraordinary\r\nanimal; a stuffed specimen does not at all give a good idea of the\r\nappearance of the head and beak when fresh; the latter becoming hard\r\nand contracted.[5]\r\n\r\n [5] I was interested by finding here the hollow conical pitfall of the\r\n lion-ant, or some other insect: first a fly fell down the treacherous\r\n slope and immediately disappeared; then came a large but unwary ant;\r\n its struggles to escape being very violent, those curious little jets\r\n of sand, described by Kirby and Spence (_Entomol._ vol. i, p. 425) as\r\n being flirted by the insect’s tail, were promptly directed against the\r\n expected victim. But the ant enjoyed a better fate than the fly and\r\n escaped the fatal jaws which lay concealed at the base of the conical\r\n hollow. This Australian pitfall was only about half the size of that\r\n made by the European lion-ant.\r\n\r\n20_th._—A long day’s ride to Bathurst. Before joining the high road we\r\nfollowed a mere path through the forest; and the country, with the\r\nexception of a few squatters’ huts, was very solitary. We experienced\r\nthis day the sirocco-like wind of Australia, which comes from the\r\nparched deserts of the interior. Clouds of dust were travelling in\r\nevery direction; and the wind felt as if it had passed over a fire. I\r\nafterwards heard that the thermometer out of doors had stood at 119°,\r\nand in a closed room at 96°. In the afternoon we came in view of the\r\ndowns of Bathurst. These undulating but nearly smooth plains are very\r\nremarkable in this country, from being absolutely destitute of trees.\r\nThey support only a thin brown pasture. We rode some miles over this\r\ncountry, and then reached the township of Bathurst, seated in the\r\nmiddle of what may be called either a very broad valley, or narrow\r\nplain. I was told at Sydney not to form too bad an opinion of Australia\r\nby judging of the country from the roadside, nor too good a one from\r\nBathurst; in this latter respect I did not feel myself in the least\r\ndanger of being prejudiced. The season, it must be owned, had been one\r\nof great drought, and the country did not wear a favourable aspect;\r\nalthough I understand it was incomparably worse two or three months\r\nbefore. The secret of the rapidly growing prosperity of Bathurst is\r\nthat the brown pasture which appears to the stranger’s eye so wretched\r\nis excellent for sheep-grazing. The town stands at the height of 2200\r\nfeet above the sea, on the banks of the Macquarie: this is one of the\r\nrivers flowing into the vast and scarcely known interior. The line of\r\nwatershed which divides the inland streams from those on the coast, has\r\na height of about 3000 feet, and runs in a north and south direction at\r\nthe distance of from eighty to a hundred miles from the seaside. The\r\nMacquarie figures in the map as a respectable river, and it is the\r\nlargest of those draining this part of the watershed; yet to my\r\nsurprise I found it a mere chain of ponds, separated from each other by\r\nspaces almost dry. Generally a small stream is running; and sometimes\r\nthere are high and impetuous floods. Scanty as the supply of the water\r\nis throughout this district, it becomes still scantier further inland.\r\n\r\n22_nd._—I commenced my return and followed a new road called Lockyer’s\r\nLine along which the country is rather more hilly and picturesque. This\r\nwas a long day’s ride; and the house where I wished to sleep was some\r\nway off the road, and not easily found. I met on this occasion, and\r\nindeed on all others, a very general and ready civility among the lower\r\norders, which, when one considers what they are, and what they have\r\nbeen, would scarcely have been expected. The farm where I passed the\r\nnight was owned by two young men who had only lately come out, and were\r\nbeginning a settler’s life. The total want of almost every comfort was\r\nnot very attractive; but future and certain prosperity was before their\r\neyes, and that not far distant.\r\n\r\nThe next day we passed through large tracts of country in flames,\r\nvolumes of smoke sweeping across the road. Before noon we joined our\r\nformer road and ascended Mount Victoria. I slept at the Weatherboard,\r\nand before dark took another\r\nwalk to the amphitheatre. On the road to Sydney I spent a very pleasant\r\nevening with Captain King at Dunheved; and thus ended my little\r\nexcursion in the colony of New South Wales.\r\n\r\nBefore arriving here the three things which interested me most were—the\r\nstate of society amongst the higher classes, the condition of the\r\nconvicts, and the degree of attraction sufficient to induce persons to\r\nemigrate. Of course, after so very short a visit, one’s opinion is\r\nworth scarcely anything; but it is as difficult not to form some\r\nopinion, as it is to form a correct judgment. On the whole, from what I\r\nheard, more than from what I saw, I was disappointed in the state of\r\nsociety. The whole community is rancorously divided into parties on\r\nalmost every subject. Among those who, from their station in life,\r\nought to be the best, many live in such open profligacy that\r\nrespectable people cannot associate with them. There is much jealousy\r\nbetween the children of the rich emancipist and the free settlers, the\r\nformer being pleased to consider honest men as interlopers. The whole\r\npopulation, poor and rich, are bent on acquiring wealth: amongst the\r\nhigher orders, wool and sheep-grazing form the constant subject of\r\nconversation. There are many serious drawbacks to the comforts of a\r\nfamily, the chief of which, perhaps, is being surrounded by convict\r\nservants. How thoroughly odious to every feeling, to be waited on by a\r\nman who the day before, perhaps, was flogged, from your representation,\r\nfor some trifling misdemeanour. The female servants are of course much\r\nworse: hence children learn the vilest expressions, and it is fortunate\r\nif not equally vile ideas.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the capital of a person, without any trouble on his\r\npart, produces him treble interest to what it will in England; and with\r\ncare he is sure to grow rich. The luxuries of life are in abundance,\r\nand very little dearer than in England, and most articles of food are\r\ncheaper. The climate is splendid, and perfectly healthy; but to my mind\r\nits charms are lost by the uninviting aspect of the country. Settlers\r\npossess a great advantage in finding their sons of service when very\r\nyoung. At the age of from sixteen to twenty they frequently take charge\r\nof distant farming stations. This, however, must happen at the expense\r\nof their boys associating entirely with\r\nconvict servants. I am not aware that the tone of society has assumed\r\nany peculiar character; but with such habits, and without intellectual\r\npursuits, it can hardly fail to deteriorate. My opinion is such that\r\nnothing but rather sharp necessity should compel me to emigrate.\r\n\r\nThe rapid prosperity and future prospects of this colony are to me, not\r\nunderstanding these subjects, very puzzling. The two main exports are\r\nwool and whale-oil, and to both of these productions there is a limit.\r\nThe country is totally unfit for canals, therefore there is a not very\r\ndistant point beyond which the land-carriage of wool will not repay the\r\nexpense of shearing and tending sheep. Pasture everywhere is so thin\r\nthat settlers have already pushed far into the interior; moreover, the\r\ncountry farther inland becomes extremely poor. Agriculture, on account\r\nof the droughts, can never succeed on an extended scale: therefore, so\r\nfar as I can see, Australia must ultimately depend upon being the\r\ncentre of commerce for the southern hemisphere and perhaps on her\r\nfuture manufactories. Possessing coal, she always has the moving power\r\nat hand. From the habitable country extending along the coast, and from\r\nher English extraction, she is sure to be a maritime nation. I formerly\r\nimagined that Australia would rise to be as grand and powerful a\r\ncountry as North America, but now it appears to me that such future\r\ngrandeur is rather problematical.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the state of the convicts, I had still fewer\r\nopportunities of judging than on other points. The first question is,\r\nwhether their condition is at all one of punishment: no one will\r\nmaintain that it is a very severe one. This, however, I suppose, is of\r\nlittle consequence as long as it continues to be an object of dread to\r\ncriminals at home. The corporeal wants of the convicts are tolerably\r\nwell supplied: their prospect of future liberty and comfort is not\r\ndistant, and, after good conduct, certain. A “ticket of leave,” which,\r\nas long as a man keeps clear of suspicion as well as of crime, makes\r\nhim free within a certain district, is given upon good conduct, after\r\nyears proportional to the length of the sentence; yet with all this,\r\nand overlooking the previous imprisonment and wretched passage out, I\r\nbelieve the years of assignment are passed away with discontent and\r\nunhappiness. As an intelligent man remarked to me, the convicts know no\r\npleasure\r\nbeyond sensuality, and in this they are not gratified. The enormous\r\nbribe which Government possesses in offering free pardons, together\r\nwith the deep horror of the secluded penal settlements, destroys\r\nconfidence between the convicts, and so prevents crime. As to a sense\r\nof shame, such a feeling does not appear to be known, and of this I\r\nwitnessed some very singular proofs. Though it is a curious fact, I was\r\nuniversally told that the character of the convict population is one of\r\narrant cowardice; not unfrequently some become desperate, and quite\r\nindifferent as to life, yet a plan requiring cool or continued courage\r\nis seldom put into execution. The worst feature in the whole case is\r\nthat although there exists what may be called a legal reform, and\r\ncomparatively little is committed which the law can touch, yet that any\r\nmoral reform should take place appears to be quite out of the question.\r\nI was assured by well-informed people that a man who should try to\r\nimprove, could not while living with other assigned servants;—his life\r\nwould be one of intolerable misery and persecution. Nor must the\r\ncontamination of the convict-ships and prisons, both here and in\r\nEngland, be forgotten. On the whole, as a place of punishment, the\r\nobject is scarcely gained; as a real system of reform it has failed, as\r\nperhaps would every other plan; but as a means of making men outwardly\r\nhonest,—of converting vagabonds, most useless in one hemisphere, into\r\nactive citizens of another, and thus giving birth to a new and splendid\r\ncountry—a grand centre of civilisation—it has succeeded to a degree\r\nperhaps unparalleled in history.\r\n\r\n\r\n30_th._—The _Beagle_ sailed for Hobart Town in Van Diemen’s Land. On\r\nthe 5th of February, after a six days’ passage, of which the first part\r\nwas fine, and the latter very cold and squally, we entered the mouth of\r\nStorm Bay; the weather justified this awful name. The bay should rather\r\nbe called an estuary, for it receives at its head the waters of the\r\nDerwent. Near the mouth there are some extensive basaltic platforms;\r\nbut higher up the land becomes mountainous, and is covered by a light\r\nwood. The lower parts of the hills which skirt the bay are cleared; and\r\nthe bright yellow fields of corn, and dark green ones of potatoes,\r\nappear very luxuriant. Late in the evening we anchored in the snug cove\r\non the shores of which stands the capital of Tasmania. The first aspect\r\nof the place was very inferior to that of Sydney; the latter might be\r\ncalled a city, this is only a town. It stands at the base of Mount\r\nWellington, a mountain 3100 feet high, but of little picturesque\r\nbeauty; from this source, however, it receives a good supply of water.\r\nRound the cove there are some fine warehouses and on one side a small\r\nfort. Coming from the Spanish settlements, where such magnificent care\r\nhas generally been paid to the fortifications, the means of defence in\r\nthese colonies appeared very contemptible. Comparing the town with\r\nSydney, I was chiefly struck with the comparative fewness of the large\r\nhouses, either built or building. Hobart Town, from the census of 1835,\r\ncontained 13,826 inhabitants, and the whole of Tasmania 36,505.\r\n\r\nHobart Town and Mount Wellington\r\n\r\nAll the aborigines have been removed to an island in Bass’s Straits, so\r\nthat Van Diemen’s Land enjoys the great advantage of being free from a\r\nnative population. This most cruel step seems to have been quite\r\nunavoidable, as the only means of stopping a fearful succession of\r\nrobberies, burnings, and murders, committed by the blacks; and which\r\nsooner or later would have ended in their utter destruction. I fear\r\nthere is no doubt that this train of evil and its consequences\r\noriginated in the infamous conduct of some of our countrymen. Thirty\r\nyears\r\nis a short period in which to have banished the last aboriginal from\r\nhis native island,—and that island nearly as large as Ireland. The\r\ncorrespondence on this subject which took place between the government\r\nat home and that of Van Diemen’s Land, is very interesting. Although\r\nnumbers of natives were shot and taken prisoners in the skirmishing,\r\nwhich was going on at intervals for several years, nothing seems fully\r\nto have impressed them with the idea of our overwhelming power, until\r\nthe whole island, in 1830, was put under martial law, and by\r\nproclamation the whole population commanded to assist in one great\r\nattempt to secure the entire race. The plan adopted was nearly similar\r\nto that of the great hunting-matches in India: a line was formed\r\nreaching across the island, with the intention of driving the natives\r\ninto a _ cul-de-sac_ on Tasman’s peninsula. The attempt failed; the\r\nnatives, having tied up their dogs, stole during one night through the\r\nlines. This is far from surprising, when their practised senses and\r\nusual manner of crawling after wild animals is considered. I have been\r\nassured that they can conceal themselves on almost bare ground, in a\r\nmanner which until witnessed is scarcely credible; their dusky bodies\r\nbeing easily mistaken for the blackened stumps which are scattered all\r\nover the country. I was told of a trial between a party of Englishmen\r\nand a native, who was to stand in full view on the side of a bare hill;\r\nif the Englishmen closed their eyes for less than a minute, he would\r\nsquat down, and then they were never able to distinguish him from the\r\nsurrounding stumps. But to return to the hunting-match; the natives\r\nunderstanding this kind of warfare, were terribly alarmed, for they at\r\nonce perceived the power and numbers of the whites. Shortly afterwards\r\na party of thirteen belonging to two tribes came in; and, conscious of\r\ntheir unprotected condition, delivered themselves up in despair.\r\nSubsequently by the intrepid exertions of Mr. Robinson, an active and\r\nbenevolent man, who fearlessly visited by himself the most hostile of\r\nthe natives, the whole were induced to act in a similar manner. They\r\nwere then removed to an island, where food and clothes were provided\r\nthem. Count Strzelecki states,[6] that “at the epoch of their\r\ndeportation in 1835, the number of natives amounted to 210. In 1842,\r\nthat is after\r\nthe interval of seven years, they mustered only fifty-four individuals;\r\nand, while each family of the interior of New South Wales,\r\nuncontaminated by contact with the whites, swarms with children, those\r\nof Flinders’ Island had during eight years an accession of only\r\nfourteen in number!”\r\n\r\n [6] _Physical Description of New South Wales and Van Diemen’s Land,_\r\n p. 354.\r\n\r\nThe _Beagle_ stayed here ten days, and in this time I made several\r\npleasant little excursions, chiefly with the object of examining the\r\ngeological structure of the immediate neighbourhood. The main points of\r\ninterest consist, first in some highly fossiliferous strata belonging\r\nto the Devonian or Carboniferous period; secondly, in proofs of a late\r\nsmall rise of the land; and lastly, in a solitary and superficial patch\r\nof yellowish limestone or travertin, which contains numerous\r\nimpressions of leaves of trees, together with land-shells, not now\r\nexisting. It is not improbable that this one small quarry includes the\r\nonly remaining record of the vegetation of Van Diemen’s Land during one\r\nformer epoch.\r\n\r\nThe climate here is damper than in New South Wales, and hence the land\r\nis more fertile. Agriculture flourishes; the cultivated fields look\r\nwell, and the gardens abound with thriving vegetables and fruit-trees.\r\nSome of the farmhouses, situated in retired spots, had a very\r\nattractive appearance. The general aspect of the vegetation is similar\r\nto that of Australia; perhaps it is a little more green and cheerful;\r\nand the pasture between the trees rather more abundant. One day I took\r\na long walk on the side of the bay opposite to the town: I crossed in a\r\nsteamboat, two of which are constantly plying backwards and forwards.\r\nThe machinery of one of these vessels was entirely manufactured in this\r\ncolony, which, from its very foundation, then numbered only three and\r\nthirty years! Another day I ascended Mount Wellington; I took with me a\r\nguide, for I failed in a first attempt, from the thickness of the wood.\r\nOur guide, however, was a stupid fellow, and conducted us to the\r\nsouthern and damp side of the mountain, where the vegetation was very\r\nluxuriant; and where the labour of the ascent, from the number of\r\nrotten trunks, was almost as great as on a mountain in Tierra del Fuego\r\nor in Chiloe. It cost us five and a half hours of hard climbing before\r\nwe reached the summit. In many parts the Eucalypti grew to a great size\r\nand composed a noble forest. In some of the dampest ravines tree-ferns\r\nflourished in an extraordinary manner; I saw one which must have been\r\nat least twenty feet high to the base of the fronds, and was in girth\r\nexactly six feet. The fronds, forming the most elegant parasols,\r\nproduced a gloomy shade, like that of the first hour of night. The\r\nsummit of the mountain is broad and flat and is composed of huge\r\nangular masses of naked greenstone. Its elevation is 3100 feet above\r\nthe level of the sea. The day was splendidly clear, and we enjoyed a\r\nmost extensive view; to the north, the country appeared a mass of\r\nwooded mountains, of about the same height with that on which we were\r\nstanding, and with an equally tame outline: to the south the broken\r\nland and water, forming many intricate bays, was mapped with clearness\r\nbefore us. After staying some hours on the summit we found a better way\r\nto descend, but did not reach the _Beagle_ till eight o’clock, after a\r\nsevere day’s work.\r\n\r\n_February_ 7_th._—The _Beagle_ sailed from Tasmania, and, on the 6th of\r\nthe ensuing month, reached King George’s Sound, situated close to the\r\nsouth-west corner of Australia. We stayed there eight days; and we did\r\nnot during our voyage pass a more dull and uninteresting time. The\r\ncountry, viewed from an eminence, appears a woody plain, with here and\r\nthere rounded and partly bare hills of granite protruding. One day I\r\nwent out with a party, in hopes of seeing a kangaroo-hunt, and walked\r\nover a good many miles of country. Everywhere we found the soil sandy,\r\nand very poor; it supported either a coarse vegetation of thin, low\r\nbrushwood and wiry grass, or a forest of stunted trees. The scenery\r\nresembled that of the high sandstone platform of the Blue Mountains;\r\nthe Casuarina (a tree somewhat resembling a Scotch fir) is, however,\r\nhere in greater number, and the Eucalyptus in rather less. In the open\r\nparts there were many grass-trees,—a plant which, in appearance, has\r\nsome affinity with the palm; but, instead of being surmounted by a\r\ncrown of noble fronds, it can boast merely of a tuft of very coarse\r\ngrass-like leaves. The general bright green colour of the brushwood and\r\nother plants, viewed from a distance, seemed to promise fertility. A\r\nsingle walk, however, was enough to dispel such an illusion; and he who\r\nthinks with me will never wish to walk again in so uninviting a\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne day I accompanied Captain Fitz Roy to Bald Head, the place\r\nmentioned by so many navigators, where some imagined that they saw\r\ncorals, and others that they saw petrified trees, standing in the\r\nposition in which they had grown. According to our view, the beds have\r\nbeen formed by the wind having heaped up fine sand, composed of minute\r\nrounded particles of shells and corals, during which process branches\r\nand roots of trees, together with many land-shells, became enclosed.\r\nThe whole then became consolidated by the percolation of calcareous\r\nmatter; and the cylindrical cavities left by the decaying of the wood\r\nwere thus also filled up with a hard pseudo-stalactitical stone. The\r\nweather is now wearing away the softer parts, and in consequence the\r\nhard casts of the roots and branches of the trees project above the\r\nsurface, and, in a singularly deceptive manner, resemble the stumps of\r\na dead thicket.\r\n\r\nA large tribe of natives, called the White Cockatoo men happened to pay\r\nthe settlement a visit while we were there. These men, as well as those\r\nof the tribe belonging to King George’s Sound, being tempted by the\r\noffer of some tubs of rice and sugar, were persuaded to hold a\r\n“corrobery,” or great dancing-party. As soon as it grew dark, small\r\nfires were lighted, and the men commenced their toilet, which consisted\r\nin painting themselves white in spots and lines. As soon as all was\r\nready, large fires were kept blazing, round which the women and\r\nchildren were collected as spectators; the Cockatoo and King George’s\r\nmen formed two distinct parties, and generally danced in answer to each\r\nother. The dancing consisted in their running either sideways or in\r\nIndian file into an open space, and stamping the ground with great\r\nforce as they marched together. Their heavy footsteps were accompanied\r\nby a kind of grunt, by beating their clubs and spears together, and by\r\nvarious other gesticulations, such as extending their arms and\r\nwriggling their bodies. It was a most rude, barbarous scene, and, to\r\nour ideas, without any sort of meaning; but we observed that the black\r\nwomen and children watched it with the greatest pleasure. Perhaps these\r\ndances originally represented actions, such as wars and victories;\r\nthere was one called the Emu dance, in which each man extended his arm\r\nin a bent manner, like the neck of that bird. In another dance,\r\none man imitated the movements of a kangaroo grazing in the woods,\r\nwhilst a second crawled up and pretended to spear him. When both tribes\r\nmingled in the dance, the ground trembled with the heaviness of their\r\nsteps, and the air resounded with their wild cries. Every one appeared\r\nin high spirits, and the group of nearly naked figures, viewed by the\r\nlight of the blazing fires, all moving in hideous harmony, formed a\r\nperfect display of a festival amongst the lowest barbarians. In Tierra\r\ndel Fuego we have beheld many curious scenes in savage life, but never,\r\nI think, one where the natives were in such high spirits, and so\r\nperfectly at their ease. After the dancing was over the whole party\r\nformed a great circle on the ground, and the boiled rice and sugar was\r\ndistributed, to the delight of all.\r\n\r\nAfter several tedious delays from clouded weather, on the 14th of March\r\nwe gladly stood out of King George’s Sound on our course to Keeling\r\nIsland. Farewell, Australia! you are a rising child, and doubtless some\r\nday will reign a great princess in the South; but you are too great and\r\nambitious for affection, yet not great enough for respect. I leave your\r\nshores without sorrow or regret.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Australian group of weapons and throwing sticks]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Inside an atoll, Keeling Island]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XX\r\n\r\n\r\nKEELING ISLAND:—CORAL FORMATIONS\r\n\r\nKeeling Island—Singular appearance—Scanty Flora—Transport of\r\nseeds—Birds and insects—Ebbing and flowing springs—Fields of dead\r\ncoral—Stones transported in the roots of trees—Great crab—Stinging\r\ncorals—Coral-eating fish—Coral formations—Lagoon islands or\r\natolls—Depth at which reef-building corals can live—Vast areas\r\ninterspersed with low coral islands—Subsidence of their\r\nfoundations—Barrier reefs—Fringing reefs—Conversion of fringing-reefs\r\ninto barrier-reefs, and into atolls—Evidence of changes in\r\nlevel—Breaches in barrier-reefs—Maldiva atolls; their peculiar\r\nstructure—Dead and submerged reefs—Areas of subsidence and\r\nelevation—Distribution of volcanoes—Subsidence slow and vast in amount.\r\n\r\n_April_ 1_st._—We arrived in view of the Keeling or Cocos Islands,\r\nsituated in the Indian Ocean, and about six hundred miles distant from\r\nthe coast of Sumatra. This is one of the lagoon-islands (or atolls) of\r\ncoral formation similar to those in the Low Archipelago which we passed\r\nnear. When the ship was in the channel at the entrance, Mr. Liesk, an\r\nEnglish resident, came off in his boat. The history of the inhabitants\r\nof this place, in as few words as possible, is as follows. About nine\r\nyears ago, Mr. Hare, a worthless character, brought from the East\r\nIndian archipelago a number of Malay slaves, which now, including\r\nchildren, amount to more than a hundred. Shortly afterwards Captain\r\nRoss, who had before visited these islands in his merchant-ship,\r\narrived from England, bringing with him his family and goods for\r\nsettlement: along with him came Mr. Liesk, who had been a mate in his\r\nvessel. The Malay slaves soon ran away from the islet on which Mr. Hare\r\nwas settled, and joined Captain Ross’s party. Mr. Hare upon this was\r\nultimately obliged to leave the place.\r\n\r\nThe Malays are now nominally in a state of freedom, and certainly are\r\nso as far as regards their personal treatment; but in most other points\r\nthey are considered as slaves. From their discontented state, from the\r\nrepeated removals from islet to islet, and perhaps also from a little\r\nmismanagement, things are not very prosperous. The island has no\r\ndomestic quadruped excepting the pig, and the main vegetable production\r\nis the cocoa-nut. The whole prosperity of the place depends on this\r\ntree; the only exports being oil from the nut, and the nuts themselves,\r\nwhich are taken to Singapore and Mauritius, where they are chiefly\r\nused, when grated, in making curries. On the cocoa-nut, also, the pigs,\r\nwhich are loaded with fat, almost entirely subsist, as do the ducks and\r\npoultry. Even a huge land-crab is furnished by nature with the means to\r\nopen and feed on this most useful production.\r\n\r\nThe ring-formed reef of the lagoon-island is surmounted in the greater\r\npart of its length by linear islets. On the northern or leeward side\r\nthere is an opening through which vessels can pass to the anchorage\r\nwithin. On entering, the scene was very curious and rather pretty; its\r\nbeauty, however, entirely depended on the brilliancy of the surrounding\r\ncolours. The shallow, clear, and still water of the lagoon, resting in\r\nits greater part on white sand, is, when illumined by a vertical sun,\r\nof the most vivid green. This brilliant expanse, several miles in\r\nwidth, is on all sides divided, either by a line of snow-white breakers\r\nfrom the dark heaving waters of the ocean, or from the blue vault of\r\nheaven by the strips of land, crowned by the level tops of the\r\ncocoa-nut trees. As a white cloud here and there affords a pleasing\r\ncontrast with the azure sky, so in the lagoon bands of living coral\r\ndarken the emerald green water.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next morning after anchoring I went on shore on Direction Island.\r\nThe strip of dry land is only a few hundred yards in width; on the\r\nlagoon side there is a white calcareous beach, the radiation from which\r\nunder this sultry climate was very oppressive; and on the outer coast a\r\nsolid broad flat of coral-rock served to break the violence of the open\r\nsea. Excepting near the lagoon, where there is some sand, the land is\r\nentirely composed of rounded fragments of coral. In such a loose, dry,\r\nstony soil, the climate of the intertropical regions alone could\r\nproduce a vigorous vegetation. On some of the smaller islets nothing\r\ncould be more elegant than the manner in which the young and full-grown\r\ncocoa-nut trees, without destroying each other’s symmetry, were mingled\r\ninto one wood. A beach of glittering white sand formed a border to\r\nthese fairy spots.\r\n\r\nI will now give a sketch of the natural history of these islands,\r\nwhich, from its very paucity, possesses a peculiar interest. The\r\ncocoa-nut tree, at first glance, seems to compose the whole wood; there\r\nare however, five or six other trees. One of these grows to a very\r\nlarge size, but, from the extreme softness of its wood, is useless;\r\nanother sort affords excellent timber for ship-building. Besides the\r\ntrees the number of plants is exceedingly limited and consists of\r\ninsignificant weeds. In my collection, which includes, I believe,\r\nnearly the perfect Flora, there are twenty species without reckoning a\r\nmoss, lichen, and fungus. To this number two trees must be added; one\r\nof which was not in flower, and the other I only heard of. The latter\r\nis a solitary tree of its kind, and grows near the beach, where,\r\nwithout doubt, the one seed was thrown up by the waves. A Guilandina\r\nalso grows on only one of the islets. I do not include in the above\r\nlist the sugar-cane, banana, some other vegetables, fruit-trees, and\r\nimported grasses. As the islands consist entirely of coral, and at one\r\ntime must have existed as mere water-washed reefs, all their\r\nterrestrial productions must have been transported here by the waves of\r\nthe sea. In accordance with this, the Florula has quite the character\r\nof a refuge for the destitute: Professor Henslow informs me that of the\r\ntwenty species nineteen belong to different genera, and these again to\r\nno less than sixteen families![1]\r\n\r\n [1] These plants are described in the _Annals of Nat. Hist._ vol. i.\r\n 1838, p. 337.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Holman’s[2] _Travels_ an account is given, on the authority of Mr.\r\nA. S. Keating, who resided twelve months on these islands, of the\r\nvarious seeds and other bodies which have been known to have been\r\nwashed on shore. “Seeds and plants from Sumatra and Java have been\r\ndriven up by the surf on the windward side of the islands. Among them\r\nhave been found the Kimiri, native of Sumatra and the peninsula of\r\nMalacca; the cocoa-nut of Balci, known by its shape and size; the\r\nDadass, which is planted by the Malays with the pepper-vine, the latter\r\nentwining round its trunk, and supporting itself by the prickles on its\r\nstem; the soap-tree; the castor-oil plant; trunks of the sago palm; and\r\nvarious kinds of seeds unknown to the Malays settled on the islands.\r\nThese are all supposed to have been driven by the N.W. monsoon to the\r\ncoast of New Holland, and thence to these islands by the S.E.\r\ntrade-wind. Large masses of Java teak and Yellow wood have also been\r\nfound, besides immense trees of red and white cedar, and the blue\r\ngum-wood of New Holland, in a perfectly sound condition. All the hardy\r\nseeds, such as creepers, retain their germinating power, but the softer\r\nkinds, among which is the mangostin, are destroyed in the passage.\r\nFishing-canoes, apparently from Java, have at times been washed on\r\nshore.” It is interesting thus to discover how numerous the seeds are,\r\nwhich, coming from several countries, are drifted over the wide ocean.\r\nProfessor Henslow tells me he believes that nearly all the plants which\r\nI brought from these islands are common littoral species in the East\r\nIndian archipelago. From the direction, however, of the winds and\r\ncurrents, it seems scarcely possible that they could have come here in\r\na direct line. If, as suggested with much probability by Mr. Keating,\r\nthey were first carried towards the coast of New Holland, and thence\r\ndrifted back together with the productions of that country, the seeds,\r\nbefore germinating, must have travelled between 1800 and 2400 miles.\r\n\r\n [2] Holman’s _Travels_, vol. iv, p. 378.\r\n\r\nChamisso,[3] when describing the Radack Archipelago, situated in the\r\nwestern part of the Pacific, states that “the sea brings to these\r\nislands the seeds and fruits of many trees, most of which have yet not\r\ngrown here. The greater part of these seeds\r\nappear to have not yet lost the capability of growing.” It is also said\r\nthat palms and bamboos from somewhere in the torrid zone, and trunks of\r\nnorthern firs, are washed on shore; these firs must have come from an\r\nimmense distance. These facts are highly interesting. It cannot be\r\ndoubted that, if there were land-birds to pick up the seeds when first\r\ncast on shore, and a soil better adapted for their growth than the\r\nloose blocks of coral, the most isolated of the lagoon islands would in\r\ntime possess a far more abundant Flora than they now have.\r\n\r\n [3] Kotzebue’s _First Voyage_, vol. iii, p. 155.\r\n\r\nThe list of land animals is even poorer than that of the plants. Some\r\nof the islets are inhabited by rats, which were brought in a ship from\r\nthe Mauritius, wrecked here. These rats are considered by Mr.\r\nWaterhouse as identical with the English kind, but they are smaller,\r\nand more brightly coloured. There are no true land-birds, for a snipe\r\nand a rail (Rallus Phillippensis), though living entirely in the dry\r\nherbage, belong to the order of Waders. Birds of this order are said to\r\noccur on several of the small low islands in the Pacific. At Ascension,\r\nwhere there is no land-bird, a rail (Porphyrio simplex) was shot near\r\nthe summit of the mountain, and it was evidently a solitary straggler.\r\nAt Tristan d’Acunha, where, according to Carmichael, there are only two\r\nland-birds, there is a coot. From these facts I believe that the\r\nwaders, after the innumerable web-footed species, are generally the\r\nfirst colonists of small isolated islands. I may add that whenever I\r\nnoticed birds, not of oceanic species, very far out at sea, they always\r\nbelonged to this order; and hence they would naturally become the\r\nearliest colonists of any remote point of land.\r\n\r\nOf reptiles I saw only one small lizard. Of insects I took pains to\r\ncollect every kind. Exclusive of spiders, which were numerous, there\r\nwere thirteen species.[4] Of these one only was a beetle. A small ant\r\nswarmed by thousands under the loose dry blocks of coral, and was the\r\nonly true insect which was abundant. Although the productions of the\r\nland are thus scanty, if we look to the waters of the surrounding sea\r\nthe number of organic beings is indeed infinite. Chamisso has\r\ndescribed[5] the natural history of a lagoon-island in the Radack\r\nArchipelago; and it is remarkable how closely its inhabitants, in\r\nnumber and kind, resemble those of Keeling Island. There is one lizard\r\nand two waders, namely, a snipe and curlew. Of plants there are\r\nnineteen species, including a fern; and some of these are the same with\r\nthose growing here, though on a spot so immensely remote, and in a\r\ndifferent ocean.\r\n\r\n [4] The thirteen species belong to the following orders:—In the\r\n _Coleoptera_, a minute Elater; _ Orthoptera_, a Gryllus and a Blatta;\r\n _Hemiptera_, one species; _Homoptera_, two; _Neuroptera_, a Chrysopa;\r\n _ Hymenoptera_, two ants; _Lepidoptera nocturna_, a Diopæa, and a\r\n Pterophorus (?); _Diptera_, two species.\r\n\r\n\r\n [5] Kotzebue’s _First Voyage_, vol. iii, p. 222.\r\n\r\nThe long strips of land, forming the linear islets, have been raised\r\nonly to that height to which the surf can throw fragments of coral, and\r\nthe wind heap up calcareous sand. The solid flat of coral rock on the\r\noutside, by its breadth, breaks the first violence of the waves, which\r\notherwise, in a day, would sweep away these islets and all their\r\nproductions. The ocean and the land seem here struggling for mastery:\r\nalthough terra firma has obtained a footing, the denizens of the water\r\nthink their claim at least equally good. In every part one meets hermit\r\ncrabs of more than one species,[6] carrying on their backs the shells\r\nwhich they have stolen from the neighbouring beach. Overhead numerous\r\ngannets, frigate-birds, and terns, rest on the trees; and the wood,\r\nfrom the many nests and from the smell of the atmosphere, might be\r\ncalled a sea-rookery. The gannets, sitting on their rude nests, gaze at\r\none with a stupid yet angry air. The noddies, as their name expresses,\r\nare silly little creatures. But there is one charming bird: it is a\r\nsmall, snow-white tern, which smoothly hovers at the distance of a few\r\nfeet above one’s head, its large black eye scanning, with quiet\r\ncuriosity, your expression. Little imagination is required to fancy\r\nthat so light and delicate a body must be tenanted by some wandering\r\nfairy spirit.\r\n\r\n [6] The large claws or pincers of some of these crabs are most\r\n beautifully adapted, when drawn back, to form an operculum to the\r\n shell, nearly as perfect as the proper one originally belonging to the\r\n molluscous animal. I was assured, and as far as my observations went I\r\n found it so, that certain species of the hermit-crab always use\r\n certain species of shells.\r\n\r\n_Sunday, April_ 3_rd._—After service I accompanied Captain Fitz Roy to\r\nthe settlement, situated at the distance of some miles, on the point of\r\nan islet thickly covered with tall cocoa-nut trees. Captain Ross and\r\nMr. Liesk live in a large barn-like house open at both ends, and lined\r\nwith mats made of woven bark. The houses of the Malays are arranged\r\nalong\r\nthe shore of the lagoon. The whole place had rather a desolate aspect,\r\nfor there were no gardens to show the signs of care and cultivation.\r\nThe natives belong to different islands in the East Indian archipelago,\r\nbut all speak the same language: we saw the inhabitants of Borneo,\r\nCelebes, Java, and Sumatra. In colour they resemble the Tahitians, from\r\nwhom they do not widely differ in features. Some of the women, however,\r\nshow a good deal of the Chinese character. I liked both their general\r\nexpressions and the sound of their voices. They appeared poor, and\r\ntheir houses were destitute of furniture; but it was evident from the\r\nplumpness of the little children, that cocoa-nuts and turtle afford no\r\nbad sustenance.\r\n\r\nOn this island the wells are situated from which ships obtain water. At\r\nfirst sight it appears not a little remarkable that the fresh water\r\nshould regularly ebb and flow with the tides; and it has even been\r\nimagined that sand has the power of filtering the salt from the\r\nsea-water. These ebbing wells are common on some of the low islands in\r\nthe West Indies. The compressed sand, or porous coral rock, is\r\npermeated like a sponge with the salt water, but the rain which falls\r\non the surface must sink to the level of the surrounding sea, and must\r\naccumulate there, displacing an equal bulk of the salt water. As the\r\nwater in the lower part of the great sponge-like coral mass rises and\r\nfalls with the tides, so will the water near the surface; and this will\r\nkeep fresh, if the mass be sufficiently compact to prevent much\r\nmechanical admixture; but where the land consists of great loose blocks\r\nof coral with open interstices, if a well be dug, the water, as I have\r\nseen, is brackish.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner we stayed to see a curious half superstitious scene acted\r\nby the Malay women. A large wooden spoon dressed in garments, and which\r\nhad been carried to the grave of a dead man, they pretend becomes\r\ninspired at the full of the moon, and will dance and jump about. After\r\nthe proper preparations, the spoon, held by two women, became\r\nconvulsed, and danced in good time to the song of the surrounding\r\nchildren and women. It was a most foolish spectacle; but Mr. Liesk\r\nmaintained that many of the Malays believed in its spiritual movements.\r\nThe dance did not commence till the\r\nmoon had risen, and it was well worth remaining to behold her bright\r\norb so quietly shining through the long arms of the cocoa-nut trees as\r\nthey waved in the evening breeze. These scenes of the tropics are in\r\nthemselves so delicious that they almost equal those dearer ones at\r\nhome, to which we are bound by each best feeling of the mind.\r\n\r\nThe next day I employed myself in examining the very interesting, yet\r\nsimple structure and origin of these islands. The water being unusually\r\nsmooth, I waded over the outer flat of dead rock as far as the living\r\nmounds of coral, on which the swell of the open sea breaks. In some of\r\nthe gullies and hollows there were beautiful green and other coloured\r\nfishes, and the form and tints of many of the zoophytes were admirable.\r\nIt is excusable to grow enthusiastic over the infinite numbers of\r\norganic beings with which the sea of the tropics, so prodigal of life,\r\nteems; yet I must confess I think those naturalists who have described,\r\nin well-known words, the submarine grottoes decked with a thousand\r\nbeauties, have indulged in rather exuberant language.\r\n\r\n\r\n_April_ 6_th._—I accompanied Captain Fitz Roy to an island at the head\r\nof the lagoon: the channel was exceedingly intricate, winding through\r\nfields of delicately branched corals. We saw several turtle and two\r\nboats were then employed in catching them. The water was so clear and\r\nshallow, that although at first a turtle quickly dives out of sight,\r\nyet in a canoe or boat under sail the pursuers after no very long chase\r\ncome up to it. A man standing ready in the bow at this moment dashes\r\nthrough the water upon the turtle’s back; then clinging with both hands\r\nby the shell of its neck, he is carried away till the animal becomes\r\nexhausted and is secured. It was quite an interesting chase to see the\r\ntwo boats thus doubling about, and the men dashing head foremost into\r\nthe water trying to seize their prey. Captain Moresby informs me that\r\nin the Chagos archipelago in this same ocean, the natives, by a\r\nhorrible process, take the shell from the back of the living turtle.\r\n“It is covered with burning charcoal, which causes the outer shell to\r\ncurl upwards, it is then forced off with a knife, and before it becomes\r\ncold flattened between boards. After this barbarous process the animal\r\nis suffered to regain its native\r\nelement, where, after a certain time, a new shell is formed; it is,\r\nhowever, too thin to be of any service, and the animal always appears\r\nlanguishing and sickly.”\r\n\r\nWhen we arrived at the head of the lagoon we crossed a narrow islet and\r\nfound a great surf breaking on the windward coast. I can hardly explain\r\nthe reason, but there is to my mind much grandeur in the view of the\r\nouter shores of these lagoon-islands. There is a simplicity in the\r\nbarrier-like beach, the margin of green bushes and tall cocoa-nuts, the\r\nsolid flat of dead coral-rock, strewed here and there with great loose\r\nfragments, and the line of furious breakers, all rounding away towards\r\neither hand. The ocean throwing its waters over the broad reef appears\r\nan invincible, all-powerful enemy; yet we see it resisted, and even\r\nconquered, by means which at first seem most weak and inefficient. It\r\nis not that the ocean spares the rock of coral; the great fragments\r\nscattered over the reef, and heaped on the beach, whence the tall\r\ncocoa-nut springs, plainly bespeak the unrelenting power of the waves.\r\nNor are any periods of repose granted. The long swell caused by the\r\ngentle but steady action of the trade-wind, always blowing in one\r\ndirection over a wide area, causes breakers, almost equalling in force\r\nthose during a gale of wind in the temperate regions, and which never\r\ncease to rage. It is impossible to behold these waves without feeling a\r\nconviction that an island, though built of the hardest rock, let it be\r\nporphyry, granite, or quartz, would ultimately yield and be demolished\r\nby such an irresistible power. Yet these low, insignificant\r\ncoral-islets stand and are victorious: for here another power, as an\r\nantagonist, takes part in the contest. The organic forces separate the\r\natoms of carbonate of lime, one by one, from the foaming breakers, and\r\nunite them into a symmetrical structure. Let the hurricane tear up its\r\nthousand huge fragments; yet what will that tell against the\r\naccumulated labour of myriads of architects at work night and day,\r\nmonth after month? Thus do we see the soft and gelatinous body of a\r\npolypus, through the agency of the vital laws, conquering the great\r\nmechanical power of the waves of an ocean which neither the art of man\r\nnor the inanimate works of nature could successfully resist.\r\n\r\nWe did not return on board till late in the evening, for we\r\nstayed a long time in the lagoon, examining the fields of coral and the\r\ngigantic shells of the chama, into which, if a man were to put his\r\nhand, he would not, as long as the animal lived, be able to withdraw\r\nit. Near the head of the lagoon I was much surprised to find a wide\r\narea, considerably more than a mile square, covered with a forest of\r\ndelicately branching corals, which, though standing upright, were all\r\ndead and rotten. At first I was quite at a loss to understand the\r\ncause; afterwards it occurred to me that it was owing to the following\r\nrather curious combination of circumstances. It should, however, first\r\nbe stated, that corals are not able to survive even a short exposure in\r\nthe air to the sun’s rays, so that their upward limit of growth is\r\ndetermined by that of lowest water at spring tides. It appears, from\r\nsome old charts, that the long island to windward was formerly\r\nseparated by wide channels into several islets; this fact is likewise\r\nindicated by the trees being younger on these portions. Under the\r\nformer condition of the reef, a strong breeze, by throwing more water\r\nover the barrier, would tend to raise the level of the lagoon. Now it\r\nacts in a directly contrary manner; for the water within the lagoon not\r\nonly is not increased by currents from the outside, but is itself blown\r\noutwards by the force of the wind. Hence it is observed that the tide\r\nnear the head of the lagoon does not rise so high during a strong\r\nbreeze as it does when it is calm. This difference of level, although\r\nno doubt very small, has, I believe, caused the death of those\r\ncoral-groves, which under the former and more open condition of the\r\nouter reef had attained the utmost possible limit of upward growth.\r\n\r\nA few miles north of Keeling there is another small atoll, the lagoon\r\nof which is nearly filled up with coral-mud. Captain Ross found\r\nembedded in the conglomerate on the outer coast a well-rounded fragment\r\nof greenstone, rather larger than a man’s head: he and the men with him\r\nwere so much surprised at this, that they brought it away and preserved\r\nit as a curiosity. The occurrence of this one stone, where every other\r\nparticle of matter is calcareous, certainly is very puzzling. The\r\nisland has scarcely ever been visited, nor is it probable that a ship\r\nhad been wrecked there. From the absence of any better explanation, I\r\ncame to the conclusion that it must have come entangled in the roots of\r\nsome large tree: when,\r\nhowever, I considered the great distance from the nearest land, the\r\ncombination of chances against a stone thus being entangled, the tree\r\nwashed into the sea, floated so far, then landed safely, and the stone\r\nfinally so embedded as to allow of its discovery, I was almost afraid\r\nof imagining a means of transport apparently so improbable. It was\r\ntherefore with great interest that I found Chamisso, the justly\r\ndistinguished naturalist who accompanied Kotzebue, stating that the\r\ninhabitants of the Radack Archipelago, a group of lagoon islands in the\r\nmidst of the Pacific, obtained stones for sharpening their instruments\r\nby searching the roots of trees which are cast upon the beach. It will\r\nbe evident that this must have happened several times, since laws have\r\nbeen established that such stones belong to the chief, and a punishment\r\nis inflicted on any one who attempts to steal them. When the isolated\r\nposition of these small islands in the midst of a vast ocean—their\r\ngreat distance from any land excepting that of coral formation,\r\nattested by the value which the inhabitants, who are such bold\r\nnavigators, attach to a stone of any kind,[7]—and the slowness of the\r\ncurrents of the open sea, are all considered, the occurrence of pebbles\r\nthus transported does appear wonderful. Stones may often be thus\r\ncarried; and if the island on which they are stranded is constructed of\r\nany other substance besides coral, they would scarcely attract\r\nattention, and their origin at least would never be guessed. Moreover,\r\nthis agency may long escape discovery from the probability of trees,\r\nespecially those loaded with stones, floating beneath the surface. In\r\nthe channels of Tierra del Fuego large quantities of drift timber are\r\ncast upon the beach, yet it is extremely rare to meet a tree swimming\r\non the water. These facts may possibly throw light on single stones,\r\nwhether angular or rounded, occasionally found embedded in fine\r\nsedimentary masses.\r\n\r\n [7] Some natives carried by Kotzebue to Kamtschatka collected stones\r\n to take back to their country.\r\n\r\nDuring another day I visited West Islet, on which the vegetation was\r\nperhaps more luxuriant than on any other. The cocoa-nut trees generally\r\ngrow separate, but here the young ones flourished beneath their tall\r\nparents, and formed with their long and curved fronds the most shady\r\narbours. Those alone who have tried it know how delicious it is to be\r\nseated in such shade, and drink the cool pleasant fluid of the\r\ncocoa-nut. In this island there is a large bay-like space, composed of\r\nthe finest white sand: it is quite level and is only covered by the\r\ntide at high water; from this large bay smaller creeks penetrate the\r\nsurrounding woods. To see a field of glittering white sand representing\r\nwater, with the cocoa-nut trees extending their tall and waving trunks\r\nround the margin, formed a singular and very pretty view.\r\n\r\nI have before alluded to a crab which lives on the cocoa-nuts; it is\r\nvery common on all parts of the dry land, and grows to a monstrous\r\nsize: it is closely allied or identical with the Birgos latro. The\r\nfront pair of legs terminate in very strong and heavy pincers, and the\r\nlast pair are fitted with others weaker and much narrower. It would at\r\nfirst be thought quite impossible for a crab to open a strong cocoa-nut\r\ncovered with the husk; but Mr. Liesk assures me that he has repeatedly\r\nseen this effected. The crab begins by tearing the husk, fibre by\r\nfibre, and always from that end under which the three eye-holes are\r\nsituated; when this is completed, the crab commences hammering with its\r\nheavy claws on one of the eye-holes till an opening is made. Then\r\nturning round its body, by the aid of its posterior and narrow pair of\r\npincers it extracts the white albuminous substance. I think this is as\r\ncurious a case of instinct as ever I heard of, and likewise of\r\nadaptation in structure between two objects apparently so remote from\r\neach other in the scheme of nature as a crab and a cocoa-nut tree. The\r\nBirgos is diurnal in its habits; but every night it is said to pay a\r\nvisit to the sea, no doubt for the purpose of moistening its branchiæ.\r\nThe young are likewise hatched, and live for some time, on the coast.\r\nThese crabs inhabit deep burrows, which they hollow out beneath the\r\nroots of trees; and where they accumulate surprising quantities of the\r\npicked fibres of the cocoa-nut husk, on which they rest as on a bed.\r\nThe Malays sometimes take advantage of this, and collect the fibrous\r\nmass to use as junk. These crabs are very good to eat; moreover, under\r\nthe tail of the larger ones there is a mass of fat, which, when melted,\r\nsometimes yields as much as a quart-bottleful of limpid oil. It has\r\nbeen stated by some authors that the Birgos crawls up the cocoa-nut\r\ntrees for the purpose of stealing the nuts: I very much doubt the\r\npossibility of this; but with the Pandanus[8] the task would be very\r\nmuch easier. I was told by Mr. Liesk that on these islands the Birgos\r\nlives only on the nuts which have fallen to the ground.\r\n\r\n [8] See _Proceedings of the Zoological Society,_ 1832, p. 17.\r\n\r\nCaptain Moresby informs me that this crab inhabits the Chagos and\r\nSeychelle groups, but not the neighbouring Maldiva archipelago. It\r\nformerly abounded at Mauritius, but only a few small ones are now found\r\nthere. In the Pacific this species, or one with closely allied habits,\r\nis said[9] to inhabit a single coral island north of the Society group.\r\nTo show the wonderful strength of the front pair of pincers, I may\r\nmention that Captain Moresby confined one in a strong tin box, which\r\nhad held biscuits, the lid being secured with wire; but the crab turned\r\ndown the edges and escaped. In turning down the edges it actually\r\npunched many small holes quite through the tin!\r\n\r\n [9] Tyerman and Bennett, _Voyage,_ etc., vol. ii, p. 33.\r\n\r\nI was a good deal surprised by finding two species of coral of the\r\ngenus Millepora (M. complanata and alcicornis), possessed of the power\r\nof stinging. The stony branches or plates, when taken fresh from the\r\nwater, have a harsh feel and are not slimy, although possessing a\r\nstrong and disagreeable smell. The stinging property seems to vary in\r\ndifferent specimens: when a piece was pressed or rubbed on the tender\r\nskin of the face or arm, a pricking sensation was usually caused, which\r\ncame on after the interval of a second, and lasted only for a few\r\nminutes. One day, however, by merely touching my face with one of the\r\nbranches, pain was instantaneously caused; it increased as usual after\r\na few seconds, and remaining sharp for some minutes, was perceptible\r\nfor half an hour afterwards. The sensation was as bad as that from a\r\nnettle, but more like that caused by the Physalia or Portuguese\r\nman-of-war. Little red spots were produced on the tender skin of the\r\narm, which appeared as if they would have formed watery pustules, but\r\ndid not. M. Quoy mentions this case of the Millepora; and I have heard\r\nof stinging corals in the West Indies. Many marine animals seem to have\r\nthis power of stinging: besides the Portuguese man-of-war, many\r\njelly-fish, and the Aplysia or sea-slug of the Cape de Verd Islands, it\r\nis stated in the _Voyage_\r\n_of the Astrolabe_ that an Actinia or sea-anemone, as well as a\r\nflexible coralline allied to Sertularia, both possess this means of\r\noffence or defence. In the East Indian sea a stinging sea-weed is said\r\nto be found.\r\n\r\nTwo species of fish, of the genus Scarus, which are common here,\r\nexclusively feed on coral: both are coloured of a splendid\r\nbluish-green, one living invariably in the lagoon, and the other\r\namongst the outer breakers. Mr. Liesk assured us that he had repeatedly\r\nseen whole shoals grazing with their strong bony jaws on the tops of\r\nthe coral branches: I opened the intestines of several and found them\r\ndistended with yellowish calcareous sandy mud. The slimy disgusting\r\nHoluthuriæ (allied to our star-fish), which the Chinese gourmands are\r\nso fond of, also feed largely, as I am informed by Dr. Allan, on\r\ncorals; and the bony apparatus within their bodies seems well adapted\r\nfor this end. These holuthuriæ, the fish, the numerous burrowing\r\nshells, and nereidous worms, which perforate every block of dead coral,\r\nmust be very efficient agents in producing the fine white mud which\r\nlies at the bottom and on the shores of the lagoon. A portion, however,\r\nof this mud, which when wet resembled pounded chalk, was found by\r\nProfessor Ehrenberg to be partly composed of siliceous-shielded\r\ninfusoria.\r\n\r\n_April_ 12_th._—In the morning we stood out of the lagoon on our\r\npassage to the Isle of France. I am glad we have visited these islands:\r\nsuch formations surely rank high amongst the wonderful objects of this\r\nworld. Captain Fitz Roy found no bottom with a line 7200 feet in\r\nlength, at the distance of only 2200 yards from the shore; hence this\r\nisland forms a lofty submarine mountain, with sides steeper even than\r\nthose of the most abrupt volcanic cone. The saucer-shaped summit is\r\nnearly ten miles across; and every single atom,[10] from the least\r\nparticle to the largest fragment of rock, in this great pile, which\r\nhowever is small compared with very many other lagoon islands, bears\r\nthe stamp of having been subjected to organic arrangement. We feel\r\nsurprise when travellers tell us of the vast dimensions of the Pyramids\r\nand other great ruins, but how utterly insignificant are the greatest\r\nof these, when compared\r\nto these mountains of stone accumulated by the agency of various minute\r\nand tender animals! This is a wonder which does not at first strike the\r\neye of the body, but, after reflection, the eye of reason.\r\n\r\n [10] I exclude, of course, some soil which has been imported here in\r\n vessels from Malacca and Java, and likewise some small fragments of\r\n pumice, drifted here by the waves. The one block of greenstone,\r\n moreover, on the northern island must be excepted.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhitsunday Island\r\n\r\n\r\nI will now give a very brief account of the three great classes of\r\ncoral-reefs; namely, Atolls, Barrier, and Fringing Reefs, and will\r\nexplain my views[11] on their formation. Almost every voyager who has\r\ncrossed the Pacific has expressed his unbounded astonishment at the\r\nlagoon islands, or as I shall for the future call them by their Indian\r\nname of atolls, and has attempted some explanation. Even as long ago as\r\nthe year 1605, Pyrard de Laval well exclaimed, “C’est une merveille de\r\nvoir chacun de ces atollons, environné d’un grand banc de pierre tout\r\nautour, n’y ayant point d’artifice humain.” The accompanying sketch of\r\nWhitsunday Island in the Pacific, copied from Captain Beechey’s\r\nadmirable _Voyage_, gives but a faint idea of the singular aspect of an\r\natoll: it is one of the smallest size, and has its narrow islets united\r\ntogether in a ring. The immensity of the ocean, the fury of the\r\nbreakers, contrasted with the lowness of the land and the smoothness of\r\nthe bright green water within the lagoon, can hardly be imagined\r\nwithout having been seen.\r\n\r\n [11] These were first read before the Geological Society in May 1837\r\n and have since been developed in a separate volume on the _Structure\r\n and Distribution of Coral Reefs._\r\n\r\nThe earlier voyagers fancied that the coral-building animals\r\ninstinctively built up their great circles to afford themselves\r\nprotection in the inner parts; but so far is this from the truth\r\nthat those massive kinds, to whose growth on the exposed outer shores\r\nthe very existence of the reef depends, cannot live within the lagoon,\r\nwhere other delicately-branching kinds flourish. Moreover, on this\r\nview, many species of distinct genera and families are supposed to\r\ncombine for one end; and of such a combination, not a single instance\r\ncan be found in the whole of nature. The theory that has been most\r\ngenerally received is that atolls are based on submarine craters; but\r\nwhen we consider the form and size of some, the number, proximity, and\r\nrelative positions of others, this idea loses its plausible character:\r\nthus Suadiva atoll is 44 geographical miles in diameter in one line, by\r\n34 miles in another line; Rimsky is 54 by 20 miles across, and it has a\r\nstrangely sinuous margin; Bow atoll is 30 miles long, and on an average\r\nonly 6 in width; Menchicoff atoll consists of three atolls united or\r\ntied together. This theory, moreover, is totally inapplicable to the\r\nnorthern Maldiva atolls in the Indian Ocean (one of which is 88 miles\r\nin length, and between 10 and 20 in breadth), for they are not bounded\r\nlike ordinary atolls by narrow reefs, but by a vast number of separate\r\nlittle atolls; other little atolls rising out of the great central\r\nlagoon-like spaces. A third and better theory was advanced by Chamisso,\r\nwho thought that from the corals growing more vigorously where exposed\r\nto the open sea, as undoubtedly is the case, the outer edges would grow\r\nup from the general foundation before any other part, and that this\r\nwould account for the ring or cup-shaped structure. But we shall\r\nimmediately see, that in this, as well as in the crater-theory, a most\r\nimportant consideration has been overlooked, namely, on what have the\r\nreef-building corals, which cannot live at a great depth, based their\r\nmassive structures?\r\n\r\nNumerous soundings were carefully taken by Captain Fitz Roy on the\r\nsteep outside of Keeling atoll, and it was found that within ten\r\nfathoms the prepared tallow at the bottom of the lead invariably came\r\nup marked with the impressions of living corals, but as perfectly clean\r\nas if it had been dropped on a carpet of turf; as the depth increased,\r\nthe impressions became less numerous, but the adhering particles of\r\nsand more and more numerous, until at last it was evident that the\r\nbottom consisted of a smooth sandy layer; to carry on the analogy of\r\nthe turf, the blades of grass grew thinner and thinner, till at\r\nlast the soil was so sterile that nothing sprang from it. From these\r\nobservations, confirmed by many others, it may be safely inferred that\r\nthe utmost depth at which corals can construct reefs is between 20 and\r\n30 fathoms. Now there are enormous areas in the Pacific and Indian\r\nOceans in which every single island is of coral formation, and is\r\nraised only to that height to which the waves can throw up fragments,\r\nand the winds pile up sand. Thus the Radack group of atolls is an\r\nirregular square, 520 miles long and 240 broad; the Low Archipelago is\r\nelliptic-formed, 840 miles in its longer, and 420 in its shorter axis:\r\nthere are other small groups and single low islands between these two\r\narchipelagoes, making a linear space of ocean actually more than 4000\r\nmiles in length, in which not one single island rises above the\r\nspecified height. Again, in the Indian Ocean there is a space of ocean\r\n1500 miles in length, including three archipelagoes, in which every\r\nisland is low and of coral formation. From the fact of the\r\nreef-building corals not living at great depths, it is absolutely\r\ncertain that throughout these vast areas, wherever there is now an\r\natoll, a foundation must have originally existed within a depth of from\r\n20 to 30 fathoms from the surface. It is improbable in the highest\r\ndegree that broad, lofty, isolated, steep-sided banks of sediment,\r\narranged in groups and lines hundreds of leagues in length, could have\r\nbeen deposited in the central and profoundest parts of the Pacific and\r\nIndian Oceans, at an immense distance from any continent, and where the\r\nwater is perfectly limpid. It is equally improbable that the elevatory\r\nforces should have uplifted throughout the above vast areas,\r\ninnumerable great rocky banks within 20 to 30 fathoms, or 120 to 180\r\nfeet, of the surface of the sea, and not one single point above that\r\nlevel; for where on the whole face of the globe can we find a single\r\nchain of mountains, even a few hundred miles in length, with their many\r\nsummits rising within a few feet of a given level, and not one pinnacle\r\nabove it? If then the foundations, whence the atoll-building corals\r\nsprang, were not formed of sediment, and if they were not lifted up to\r\nthe required level, they must of necessity have subsided into it; and\r\nthis at once solves the difficulty. For as mountain after mountain, and\r\nisland after island, slowly sank beneath the water, fresh bases would\r\nbe successively afforded for the growth\r\nof the corals. It is impossible here to enter into all the necessary\r\ndetails, but I venture to defy[12] any one to explain in any other\r\nmanner how it is possible that numerous islands should be distributed\r\nthroughout vast areas—all the islands being low—all being built of\r\ncorals, absolutely requiring a foundation within a limited depth from\r\nthe surface.\r\n\r\n [12] It is remarkable that Mr. Lyell, even in the first edition of his\r\n _Principles of Geology,_ inferred that the amount of subsidence in the\r\n Pacific must have exceeded that of elevation, from the area of land\r\n being very small relatively to the agents there tending to form it,\r\n namely, the growth of coral and volcanic action.\r\n\r\n\r\nBarrier-reef, Bolabola\r\n\r\nBefore explaining how atoll-formed reefs acquire their peculiar\r\nstructure, we must turn to the second great class, namely,\r\nBarrier-reefs. These either extend in straight lines in front of the\r\nshores of a continent or of a large island, or they encircle smaller\r\nislands; in both cases, being separated from the land by a broad and\r\nrather deep channel of water, analogous to the lagoon within an atoll.\r\nIt is remarkable how little attention has been paid to encircling\r\nbarrier-reefs; yet they are truly wonderful structures. The\r\naccompanying sketch represents part of the barrier encircling the\r\nisland of Bolabola in the Pacific, as seen from one of the central\r\npeaks. In this instance the whole line of reef has been converted into\r\nland; but usually a snow-white line of great breakers, with only here\r\nand there a single low islet crowned with cocoa-nut trees, divides the\r\ndark heaving waters of the ocean from the light green expanse of the\r\nlagoon-channel. And the quiet waters of this channel generally bathe a\r\nfringe of low alluvial soil, loaded with the most beautiful productions\r\nof the tropics, and lying at the foot of the wild, abrupt, central\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\n\r\nEncircling barrier-reefs are of all sizes, from three miles to no less\r\nthan forty-four miles in diameter; and that which fronts one side, and\r\nencircles both ends, of New Caledonia, is 400 miles long. Each reef\r\nincludes one, two, or several rocky islands of various heights; and in\r\none instance, even as many as twelve separate islands. The reef runs at\r\na greater or less distance from the included land; in the Society\r\nArchipelago generally from one to three or four miles; but at Hogoleu\r\nthe reef is 20 miles on the southern side, and 14 miles on the opposite\r\nor northern side, from the included islands. The depth within the\r\nlagoon-channel also varies much; from 10 to 30 fathoms may be taken as\r\nan average; but at Vanikoro there are spaces no less than 56 fathoms or\r\n336 feet deep. Internally the reef either slopes gently into the\r\nlagoon-channel, or ends in a perpendicular wall sometimes between two\r\nand three hundred feet under water in height: externally the reef\r\nrises, like an atoll, with extreme abruptness out of the profound\r\ndepths of the ocean. What can be more singular than these structures?\r\nWe see an island, which may be compared to a castle situated on the\r\nsummit of a lofty submarine mountain, protected by a great wall of\r\ncoral-rock, always steep externally and sometimes internally, with a\r\nbroad level summit, here and there breached by narrow gateways, through\r\nwhich the largest ships can enter the wide and deep encircling moat.\r\n\r\nAs far as the actual reef of coral is concerned, there is not the\r\nsmallest difference in general size, outline, grouping, and even in\r\nquite trifling details of structure, between a barrier and an atoll.\r\nThe geographer Balbi has well remarked that an encircled island is an\r\natoll with high land rising out of its lagoon; remove the land from\r\nwithin, and a perfect atoll is left.\r\n\r\nBut what has caused these reefs to spring up at such great distances\r\nfrom the shores of the included islands? It cannot be that the corals\r\nwill not grow close to the land; for the shores within the\r\nlagoon-channel, when not surrounded by alluvial soil, are often fringed\r\nby living reefs; and we shall presently see that there is a whole\r\nclass, which I have called Fringing-reefs from their close attachment\r\nto the shores both of continents and of islands. Again, on what have\r\nthe\r\nreef-building corals, which cannot live at great depths, based their\r\nencircling structures? This is a great apparent difficulty, analogous\r\nto that in the case of atolls, which has generally been overlooked. It\r\nwill be perceived more clearly by inspecting the following sections\r\nwhich are real ones, taken in north and south lines, through the\r\nislands with their barrier-reefs, of Vanikoro, Gambier, and Maurua; and\r\nthey are laid down, both vertically and horizontally, on the same scale\r\nof a quarter of an inch to a mile.\r\n\r\nSections of barrier-reefs\r\n\r\nIt should be observed that the sections might have been taken in any\r\ndirection through these islands, or through many other encircled\r\nislands, and the general features would have been the same. Now bearing\r\nin mind that reef-building coral cannot live at a greater depth than\r\nfrom 20 to 30 fathoms, and that the scale is so small that the plummets\r\non the right hand show a depth of 200 fathoms, on what are these\r\nbarrier-reefs based? Are we to suppose that each island is surrounded\r\nby a collar-like submarine ledge of rock, or by a great bank of\r\nsediment, ending abruptly where the reef ends? If the sea had formerly\r\neaten deeply into the islands, before they were protected by the reefs,\r\nthus having left a shallow ledge round them under water, the present\r\nshores would have been invariably bounded by great precipices; but this\r\nis most rarely the case. Moreover, on this notion, it is not possible\r\nto explain\r\nwhy the corals should have sprung up, like a wall, from the extreme\r\nouter margin of the ledge, often leaving a broad space of water within,\r\ntoo deep for the growth of corals. The accumulation of a wide bank of\r\nsediment all round these islands, and generally widest where the\r\nincluded islands are smallest, is highly improbable, considering their\r\nexposed positions in the central and deepest parts of the ocean. In the\r\ncase of the barrier-reef of New Caledonia, which extends for 150 miles\r\nbeyond the northern point of the island, in the same straight line with\r\nwhich it fronts the west coast, it is hardly possible to believe that a\r\nbank of sediment could thus have been straightly deposited in front of\r\na lofty island, and so far beyond its termination in the open sea.\r\nFinally, if we look to other oceanic islands of about the same height\r\nand of similar geological constitution, but not encircled by\r\ncoral-reefs, we may in vain search for so trifling a circumambient\r\ndepth as 30 fathoms, except quite near to their shores; for usually\r\nland that rises abruptly out of water, as do most of the encircled and\r\nnon-encircled oceanic islands, plunges abruptly under it. On what then,\r\nI repeat, are these barrier reefs based? Why, with their wide and deep\r\nmoat-like channels, do they stand so far from the included land? We\r\nshall soon see how easily these difficulties disappear.\r\n\r\nWe come now to our third class of Fringing-reefs, which will require a\r\nvery short notice. Where the land slopes abruptly under water, these\r\nreefs are only a few yards in width, forming a mere ribbon or fringe\r\nround the shores: where the land slopes gently under the water the reef\r\nextends farther, sometimes even as much as a mile from the land; but in\r\nsuch cases the soundings outside the reef always show that the\r\nsubmarine prolongation of the land is gently inclined. In fact the\r\nreefs extend only to that distance from the shore at which a foundation\r\nwithin the requisite depth from 20 to 30 fathoms is found. As far as\r\nthe actual reef is concerned, there is no essential difference between\r\nit and that forming a barrier or an atoll: it is, however, generally of\r\nless width, and consequently few islets have been formed on it. From\r\nthe corals growing more vigorously on the outside, and from the noxious\r\neffect of the sediment washed inwards, the outer edge of the reef is\r\nthe highest part, and between it and the land\r\nthere is generally a shallow sandy channel a few feet in depth. Where\r\nbanks of sediment have accumulated near to the surface, as in parts of\r\nthe West Indies, they sometimes become fringed with corals, and hence\r\nin some degree resemble lagoon-islands or atolls, in the same manner as\r\nfringing-reefs, surrounding gently sloping islands, in some degree\r\nresemble barrier-reefs.\r\n\r\nSection of coral-reef\r\n\r\nNo theory on the formation of coral-reefs can be considered\r\nsatisfactory which does not include the three great classes. We have\r\nseen that we are driven to believe in the subsidence of those vast\r\nareas, interspersed with low islands, of which not one rises above the\r\nheight to which the wind and waves can throw up matter, and yet are\r\nconstructed by animals requiring a foundation, and that foundation to\r\nlie at no great depth. Let us then take an island surrounded by\r\nfringing-reefs, which offer no difficulty in their structure; and let\r\nthis island with its reef, represented by the unbroken lines in Plate\r\n96, slowly subside. Now as the island sinks down, either a few feet at\r\na time or quite insensibly, we may safely infer, from what is known of\r\nthe conditions favourable to the growth of coral, that the living\r\nmasses, bathed by the surf on the margin of the reef, will soon regain\r\nthe surface. The water, however, will encroach little by little on the\r\nshore, the island becoming lower and smaller, and the space between the\r\ninner edge of the reef and the beach proportionally broader. A section\r\nof the reef and island in this state, after a subsidence of several\r\nhundred feet, is given by the dotted lines. Coral islets are supposed\r\nto have been formed on the reef; and a ship is anchored in the\r\nlagoon-channel. This channel will be more or less deep, according to\r\nthe rate of subsidence, to the amount of sediment accumulated in it,\r\nand to the growth of the delicately branched corals which can live\r\nthere. The section in this state resembles in every respect one drawn\r\nthrough an encircled island: in fact, it is a real section (on the\r\nscale of .517 of an inch to a mile) through Bolabola in the Pacific. We\r\ncan now at once see why encircling barrier-reefs stand so far from the\r\nshores which they front. We can also perceive that a line drawn\r\nperpendicularly down from the outer edge of the new reef, to the\r\nfoundation of solid rock beneath the old fringing-reef, will exceed by\r\nas many feet as there have been feet of subsidence, that small limit of\r\ndepth at which the effective corals can live:—the little architects\r\nhaving built up their great wall-like mass, as the whole sank down,\r\nupon a basis formed of other corals and their consolidated fragments.\r\nThus the difficulty on this head, which appeared so great, disappears.\r\n\r\nSection of coral-reef\r\n\r\nIf, instead of an island, we had taken the shore of a continent fringed\r\nwith reefs, and had imagined it to have subsided, a great straight\r\nbarrier, like that of Australia or New Caledonia, separated from the\r\nland by a wide and deep channel, would evidently have been the result.\r\n\r\nLet us take our new encircling barrier-reef, of which the section is\r\nnow represented by unbroken lines, and which, as I have said, is a real\r\nsection through Bolabola, and let it go on subsiding. As the\r\nbarrier-reef slowly sinks down, the corals\r\nwill go on vigorously growing upwards; but as the island sinks, the\r\nwater will gain inch by inch on the shore—the separate mountains first\r\nforming separate islands within one great reef—and finally, the last\r\nand highest pinnacle disappearing. The instant this takes place, a\r\nperfect atoll is formed: I have said, remove the high land from within\r\nan encircling barrier-reef, and an atoll is left, and the land has been\r\nremoved. We can now perceive how it comes that atolls, having sprung\r\nfrom encircling barrier-reefs, resemble them in general size, form, in\r\nthe manner in which they are grouped together, and in their arrangement\r\nin single or double lines; for they may be called rude outline charts\r\nof the sunken islands over which they stand. We can further see how it\r\narises that the atolls in the Pacific and Indian Oceans extend in lines\r\nparallel to the generally prevailing strike of the high islands and\r\ngreat coast-lines of those oceans. I venture, therefore, to affirm that\r\non the theory of the upward growth of the corals during the sinking of\r\nthe land,[13] all the leading features in those wonderful structures,\r\nthe lagoon-islands or atolls, which have so long excited the attention\r\nof voyagers, as well as in the no less wonderful barrier-reefs, whether\r\nencircling small islands or stretching for hundreds of miles along the\r\nshores of a continent, are simply explained.\r\n\r\n [13] It has been highly satisfactory to me to find the following\r\n passage in a pamphlet by Mr. Couthouy, one of the naturalists in the\r\n great Antarctic Expedition of the United States:—“Having personally\r\n examined a large number of coral-islands, and resided eight months\r\n among the volcanic class having shore and partially encircling reefs,\r\n I may be permitted to state that my own observations have impressed a\r\n conviction of the correctness of the theory of Mr. Darwin.” The\r\n naturalists, however, of this expedition differ with me on some points\r\n respecting coral formations.\r\n\r\n\r\nBolabola Island\r\n\r\nIt may be asked whether I can offer any direct evidence of the\r\nsubsidence of barrier-reefs or atolls; but it must be borne in mind how\r\ndifficult it must ever be to detect a movement, the tendency of which\r\nis to hide under water the part affected. Nevertheless, at Keeling\r\natoll I observed on all sides of the lagoon old cocoa-nut trees\r\nundermined and falling; and in one place the foundation-posts of a\r\nshed, which the inhabitants asserted had stood seven years before just\r\nabove high-water mark, but now was daily washed by every tide; on\r\ninquiry I found that three earthquakes, one of them severe, had been\r\nfelt here during the last ten years. At Vanikoro\r\nthe lagoon-channel is remarkably deep, scarcely any alluvial soil has\r\naccumulated at the foot of the lofty included mountains, and remarkably\r\nfew islets have been formed by the heaping of fragments and sand on the\r\nwall-like barrier reef; these facts, and some analogous ones, led me to\r\nbelieve that this island must lately have subsided and the reef grown\r\nupwards: here again earthquakes are frequent and very severe. In the\r\nSociety Archipelago, on the other hand, where the lagoon-channels are\r\nalmost choked up, where much low alluvial land has accumulated, and\r\nwhere in some cases long islets have been formed on the\r\nbarrier-reefs—facts all showing that the islands have not very lately\r\nsubsided—only feeble shocks are most rarely felt. In these coral\r\nformations, where the land and water seem struggling for mastery, it\r\nmust be ever difficult to decide between the effects of a change in the\r\nset of the tides and of a slight subsidence: that many of these reefs\r\nand atolls are subject to changes of some kind is certain; on some\r\natolls the islets appear to have increased greatly within a late\r\nperiod; on others they have been partially or wholly washed away. The\r\ninhabitants of parts of the Maldiva Archipelago know the date of the\r\nfirst formation of some islets; in other parts the corals are now\r\nflourishing on water-washed reefs, where holes made for graves attest\r\nthe former existence of inhabited land. It is difficult to believe in\r\nfrequent changes in the tidal currents of an open ocean; whereas we\r\nhave in the earthquakes recorded by the natives on some atolls, and in\r\nthe great fissures observed on other atolls, plain evidence of changes\r\nand disturbances in progress in the subterranean regions.\r\n\r\nIt is evident, on our theory, that coasts merely fringed by reefs\r\ncannot have subsided to any perceptible amount; and therefore they\r\nmust, since the growth of their corals, either have remained stationary\r\nor have been upheaved. Now it is remarkable how generally it can be\r\nshown, by the presence of upraised organic remains, that the fringed\r\nislands have been elevated: and so far, this is indirect evidence in\r\nfavour of our theory. I was particularly struck with this fact, when I\r\nfound, to my surprise,\r\nthat the descriptions given by MM. Quoy and Gaimard were applicable,\r\nnot to reefs in general as implied by them, but only to those of the\r\nfringing class; my surprise, however, ceased when I afterwards found\r\nthat, by a strange chance, all the several islands visited by these\r\neminent naturalists could be shown by their own statements to have been\r\nelevated within a recent geological era.\r\n\r\nNot only the grand features in the structure of barrier-reefs and of\r\natolls, and of their likeness to each other in form, size, and other\r\ncharacters, are explained on the theory of subsidence—which theory we\r\nare independently forced to admit in the very areas in question, from\r\nthe necessity of finding bases for the corals within the requisite\r\ndepth—but many details in structure and exceptional cases can thus also\r\nbe simply explained. I will give only a few instances. In barrier-reefs\r\nit has long been remarked with surprise that the passages through the\r\nreef exactly face valleys in the included land, even in cases where the\r\nreef is separated from the land by a lagoon-channel so wide and so much\r\ndeeper than the actual passage itself, that it seems hardly possible\r\nthat the very small quantity of water or sediment brought down could\r\ninjure the corals on the reef. Now, every reef of the fringing class is\r\nbreached by a narrow gateway in front of the smallest rivulet, even if\r\ndry during the greater part of the year, for the mud, sand, or gravel\r\noccasionally washed down kills the corals on which it is deposited.\r\nConsequently, when an island thus fringed subsides, though most of the\r\nnarrow gateways will probably become closed by the outward and upward\r\ngrowth of the corals, yet any that are not closed (and some must always\r\nbe kept open by the sediment and impure water flowing out of the\r\nlagoon-channel) will still continue to front exactly the upper parts of\r\nthose valleys at the mouths of which the original basal fringing-reef\r\nwas breached.\r\n\r\nCorals\r\n\r\nWe can easily see how an island fronted only on one side, or on one\r\nside with one end or both ends encircled by barrier-reefs, might after\r\nlong-continued subsidence be converted either into a single wall-like\r\nreef, or into an atoll with a great straight spur projecting from it,\r\nor into two or three atolls tied together by straight reefs—all of\r\nwhich exceptional cases actually occur. As the reef-building corals\r\nrequire food, are preyed upon by other animals, are killed by sediment,\r\ncannot adhere to a loose bottom, and may be easily carried down to a\r\ndepth whence they cannot spring up again, we need feel no\r\nsurprise at the reefs both of atolls and barriers becoming in parts\r\nimperfect. The great barrier of New Caledonia is thus imperfect and\r\nbroken in many parts; hence, after long subsidence, this great reef\r\nwould not produce one great atoll 400 miles in length, but a chain or\r\narchipelago of atolls, of very nearly the same dimensions with those in\r\nthe Maldiva Archipelago. Moreover, in an atoll once breached on\r\nopposite sides, from the likelihood of the oceanic and tidal currents\r\npassing straight through the breaches, it is extremely improbable that\r\nthe corals, especially during continued subsidence, would ever be able\r\nagain to unite the rim; if they did not, as the whole sank downwards,\r\none atoll would be divided into two or more. In the Maldiva Archipelago\r\nthere are distinct atolls so related to each other in position, and\r\nseparated by channels either unfathomable or very deep (the channel\r\nbetween Ross and Ari atolls is 150 fathoms, and that between the north\r\nand south Nillandoo atolls is 200 fathoms in depth), that it is\r\nimpossible to look at a map of them without believing that they were\r\nonce more intimately related. And in this same archipelago,\r\nMahlos-Mahdoo atoll is divided by a bifurcating channel from 100 to 132\r\nfathoms in depth, in such a manner that it is scarcely possible to say\r\nwhether it ought strictly to be\r\ncalled three separate atolls, or one great atoll not yet finally\r\ndivided.\r\n\r\nI will not enter on many more details; but I must remark that the\r\ncurious structure of the northern Maldiva atolls receives (taking into\r\nconsideration the free entrance of the sea through their broken\r\nmargins) a simple explanation in the upward and outward growth of the\r\ncorals, originally based both on small detached reefs in their lagoons,\r\nsuch as occur in common atolls, and on broken portions of the linear\r\nmarginal reef, such as bounds every atoll of the ordinary form. I\r\ncannot refrain from once again remarking on the singularity of these\r\ncomplex structures—a great sandy and generally concave disk rises\r\nabruptly from the unfathomable ocean, with its central expanse studded\r\nand its edge symmetrically bordered with oval basins of coral-rock just\r\nlipping the surface of the sea, sometimes clothed with vegetation, and\r\neach containing a lake of clear water!\r\n\r\nOne more point in detail: as in the two neighbouring archipelagoes\r\ncorals flourish in one and not in the other, and as so many conditions\r\nbefore enumerated must affect their existence, it would be an\r\ninexplicable fact if, during the changes to which earth, air, and water\r\nare subjected, the reef-building corals were to keep alive for\r\nperpetuity on any one spot or area. And as by our theory the areas\r\nincluding atolls and barrier-reefs are subsiding, we ought occasionally\r\nto find reefs both dead and submerged. In all reefs, owing to the\r\nsediment being washed out of the lagoon or lagoon-channel to leeward,\r\nthat side is least favourable to the long-continued vigorous growth of\r\nthe corals; hence dead portions of reef not unfrequently occur on the\r\nleeward side; and these, though still retaining their proper wall-like\r\nform, are now in several instances sunk several fathoms beneath the\r\nsurface. The Chagos group appears from some cause, possibly from the\r\nsubsidence having been too rapid, at present to be much less favourably\r\ncircumstanced for the growth of reefs than formerly: one atoll has a\r\nportion of its marginal reef, nine miles in length, dead and submerged;\r\na second has only a few quite small living points which rise to the\r\nsurface, a third and fourth are entirely dead and submerged; a fifth is\r\na mere wreck, with its structure almost obliterated. It is remarkable\r\nthat in all these cases the dead reefs and portions of reef\r\nlie at nearly the same depth, namely, from six to eight fathoms beneath\r\nthe surface, as if they had been carried down by one uniform movement.\r\nOne of these “half-drowned atolls,” so called by Captain Moresby (to\r\nwhom I am indebted for much invaluable information), is of vast size,\r\nnamely, ninety nautical miles across in one direction, and seventy\r\nmiles in another line; and is in many respects eminently curious. As by\r\nour theory it follows that new atolls will generally be formed in each\r\nnew area of subsidence, two weighty objections might have been raised,\r\nnamely, that atolls must be increasing indefinitely in number; and\r\nsecondly, that in old areas of subsidence each separate atoll must be\r\nincreasing indefinitely in thickness, if proofs of their occasional\r\ndestruction could not have been adduced. Thus have we traced the\r\nhistory of these great rings of coral-rock, from their first origin\r\nthrough their normal changes, and through the occasional accidents of\r\ntheir existence, to their death and final obliteration.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn my volume on _Coral Formations_ I have published a map, in which I\r\nhave coloured all the atolls dark-blue, the barrier-reefs pale-blue,\r\nand the fringing reefs red. These latter reefs have been formed whilst\r\nthe land has been stationary, or, as appears from the frequent presence\r\nof upraised organic remains, whilst it has been slowly rising: atolls\r\nand barrier-reefs, on the other hand, have grown up during the directly\r\nopposite movement of subsidence, which movement must have been very\r\ngradual, and in the case of atolls so vast in amount as to have buried\r\nevery mountain-summit over wide ocean-spaces. Now in this map we see\r\nthat the reefs tinted pale and dark-blue, which have been produced by\r\nthe same order of movement, as a general rule manifestly stand near\r\neach other. Again we see that the areas with the two blue tints are of\r\nwide extent; and that they lie separate from extensive lines of coast\r\ncoloured red, both of which circumstances might naturally have been\r\ninferred, on the theory of the nature of the reefs having been governed\r\nby the nature of the earth’s movement. It deserves notice that in more\r\nthan one instance where single red and blue circles approach near each\r\nother, I can show that there have been oscillations of level; for in\r\nsuch cases the red or fringed\r\ncircles consist of atolls, originally by our theory formed during\r\nsubsidence, but subsequently upheaved; and on the other hand, some of\r\nthe pale-blue or encircled islands are composed of coral-rock, which\r\nmust have been uplifted to its present height before that subsidence\r\ntook place, during which the existing barrier-reefs grew upwards.\r\n\r\nAuthors have noticed with surprise that although atolls are the\r\ncommonest coral-structures throughout some enormous oceanic tracts,\r\nthey are entirely absent in other seas, as in the West Indies: we can\r\nnow at once perceive the cause, for where there has not been\r\nsubsidence, atolls cannot have been formed; and in the case of the West\r\nIndies and parts of the East Indies, these tracts are known to have\r\nbeen rising within the recent period. The larger areas, coloured red\r\nand blue, are all elongated; and between the two colours there is a\r\ndegree of rude alternation, as if the rising of one had balanced the\r\nsinking of the other. Taking into consideration the proofs of recent\r\nelevation both on the fringed coasts and on some others (for instance,\r\nin South America) where there are no reefs, we are led to conclude that\r\nthe great continents are for the most part rising areas: and from the\r\nnature of the coral-reefs, that the central parts of the great oceans\r\nare sinking areas. The East Indian Archipelago, the most broken land in\r\nthe world, is in most parts an area of elevation, but surrounded and\r\npenetrated, probably in more lines than one, by narrow areas of\r\nsubsidence.\r\n\r\nI have marked with vermilion spots all the many known active volcanos\r\nwithin the limits of this same map. Their entire absence from every one\r\nof the great subsiding areas, coloured either pale or dark blue, is\r\nmost striking; and not less so is the coincidence of the chief volcanic\r\nchains with the parts coloured red, which we are led to conclude have\r\neither long remained stationary, or more generally have been recently\r\nupraised. Although a few of the vermilion spots occur within no great\r\ndistance of single circles tinted blue, yet not one single active\r\nvolcano is situated within several hundred miles of an archipelago, or\r\neven small group of atolls. It is, therefore, a striking fact that in\r\nthe Friendly Archipelago, which consists of a group of atolls upheaved\r\nand since partially worn down, two volcanos, and perhaps more, are\r\nhistorically\r\nknown to have been in action. On the other hand, although most of the\r\nislands in the Pacific which are encircled by barrier-reefs are of\r\nvolcanic origin, often with the remnants of craters still\r\ndistinguishable, not one of them is known to have ever been in\r\neruption. Hence in these cases it would appear that volcanos burst\r\nforth into action and become extinguished on the same spots,\r\naccordingly as elevatory or subsiding movements prevail there.\r\nNumberless facts could be adduced to prove that upraised organic\r\nremains are common wherever there are active volcanos; but until it\r\ncould be shown that in areas of subsidence volcanos were either absent\r\nor inactive, the inference, however probable in itself, that their\r\ndistribution depended on the rising or falling of the earth’s surface,\r\nwould have been hazardous. But now, I think, we may freely admit this\r\nimportant deduction.\r\n\r\nTaking a final view of the map, and bearing in mind the statements made\r\nwith respect to the upraised organic remains, we must feel astonished\r\nat the vastness of the areas which have suffered changes in level\r\neither downwards or upwards, within a period not geologically remote.\r\nIt would appear also that the elevatory and subsiding movements follow\r\nnearly the same laws. Throughout the spaces interspersed with atolls,\r\nwhere not a single peak of high land has been left above the level of\r\nthe sea, the sinking must have been immense in amount. The sinking,\r\nmoreover, whether continuous, or recurrent with intervals sufficiently\r\nlong for the corals again to bring up their living edifices to the\r\nsurface, must necessarily have been extremely slow. This conclusion is\r\nprobably the most important one which can be deduced from the study of\r\ncoral formations;—and it is one which it is difficult to imagine how\r\notherwise could ever have been arrived at. Nor can I quite pass over\r\nthe probability of the former existence of large archipelagoes of lofty\r\nislands, where now only rings of coral-rock scarcely break the open\r\nexpanse of the sea, throwing some light on the distribution of the\r\ninhabitants of the other high islands, now left standing so immensely\r\nremote from each other in the midst of the great oceans. The\r\nreef-constructing corals have indeed reared and preserved wonderful\r\nmemorials of the subterranean oscillations of level; we see in each\r\nbarrier-reef a proof that the land has\r\nthere subsided, and in each atoll a monument over an island now lost.\r\nWe may thus, like unto a geologist who had lived his ten thousand years\r\nand kept a record of the passing changes, gain some insight into the\r\ngreat system by which the surface of this globe has been broken up, and\r\nland and water interchanged.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Birgos Latro, Keeling Island]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: St. Louis, Mauritius]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXI\r\n\r\n\r\nMAURITIUS TO ENGLAND\r\n\r\nMauritius, beautiful appearance of—Great crateriform ring of\r\nmountains—Hindoos—St. Helena—History of the changes in the\r\nvegetation—Cause of the extinction of land-shells—Ascension—Variation\r\nin the imported rats—Volcanic bombs—Beds of infusoria—Bahia,\r\nBrazil—Splendour of tropical scenery—Pernambuco—Singular\r\nreef—Slavery—Return to England—Retrospect on our voyage.\r\n\r\n_April_ 29_th._—In the morning we passed round the northern end of\r\nMauritius, or the Isle of France. From this point of view the aspect of\r\nthe island equalled the expectations raised by the many well-known\r\ndescriptions of its beautiful scenery. The sloping plain of the\r\nPamplemousses, interspersed with houses, and coloured by the large\r\nfields of sugar-cane of a bright green, composed the foreground. The\r\nbrilliancy of the green was the more remarkable because it is a colour\r\nwhich generally is conspicuous only from a very short distance. Towards\r\nthe centre of the island groups of wooded mountains rose out of this\r\nhighly cultivated plain; their summits, as so commonly happens with\r\nancient volcanic rocks, being jagged\r\ninto the sharpest points. Masses of white clouds were collected around\r\nthese pinnacles, as if for the sake of pleasing the stranger’s eye. The\r\nwhole island, with its sloping border and central mountains, was\r\nadorned with an air of perfect elegance: the scenery, if I may use such\r\nan expression, appeared to the sight harmonious.\r\n\r\nI spent the greater part of the next day in walking about the town and\r\nvisiting different people. The town is of considerable size, and is\r\nsaid to contain 20,000 inhabitants; the streets are very clean and\r\nregular. Although the island has been so many years under the English\r\ngovernment, the general character of the place is quite French:\r\nEnglishmen speak to their servants in French, and the shops are all\r\nFrench; indeed I should think that Calais or Boulogne was much more\r\nAnglified. There is a very pretty little theatre in which operas are\r\nexcellently performed. We were also surprised at seeing large\r\nbooksellers’ shops, with well-stored shelves;—music and reading bespeak\r\nour approach to the old world of civilisation; for in truth both\r\nAustralia and America are new worlds.\r\n\r\nThe various races of men walking in the streets afford the most\r\ninteresting spectacle in Port Louis. Convicts from India are banished\r\nhere for life; at present there are about 800, and they are employed in\r\nvarious public works. Before seeing these people, I had no idea that\r\nthe inhabitants of India were such noble-looking figures. Their skin is\r\nextremely dark, and many of the older men had large mustaches and\r\nbeards of a snow-white colour; this, together with the fire of their\r\nexpression, gave them quite an imposing aspect. The greater number had\r\nbeen banished for murder and the worst crimes; others for causes which\r\ncan scarcely be considered as moral faults, such as for not obeying,\r\nfrom superstitious motives, the English laws. These men are generally\r\nquiet and well-conducted; from their outward conduct, their cleanliness\r\nand faithful observance of their strange religious rites, it was\r\nimpossible to look at them with the same eyes as on our wretched\r\nconvicts in New South Wales.\r\n\r\n_May_ 1_st._—Sunday. I took a quiet walk along the sea-coast to the\r\nnorth of the town. The plain in this part is quite uncultivated; it\r\nconsists of a field of black lava, smoothed over with coarse grass and\r\nbushes, the latter being chiefly Mimosas.\r\nThe scenery may be described as intermediate in character between that\r\nof the Galapagos and of Tahiti; but this will convey a definite idea to\r\nvery few persons. It is a very pleasant country, but it has not the\r\ncharms of Tahiti, or the grandeur of Brazil. The next day I ascended La\r\nPouce, a mountain so called from a thumb-like projection, which rises\r\nclose behind the town to a height of 2,600 feet. The centre of the\r\nisland consists of a great platform, surrounded by old broken basaltic\r\nmountains, with their strata dipping seawards. The central platform,\r\nformed of comparatively recent streams of lava, is of an oval shape,\r\nthirteen geographical miles across in the line of its shorter axis. The\r\nexterior bounding mountains come into that class of structures called\r\nCraters of Elevation, which are supposed to have been formed not like\r\nordinary craters, but by a great and sudden upheaval. There appear to\r\nme to be insuperable objections to this view: on the other hand, I can\r\nhardly believe, in this and in some other cases, that these marginal\r\ncrateriform mountains are merely the basal remnants of immense\r\nvolcanos, of which the summits either have been blown off or swallowed\r\nup in subterranean abysses.\r\n\r\nFrom our elevated position we enjoyed an excellent view over the\r\nisland. The country on this side appears pretty well cultivated, being\r\ndivided into fields and studded with farm-houses. I was however assured\r\nthat of the whole land not more than half is yet in a productive state;\r\nif such be the case, considering the present large export of sugar,\r\nthis island, at some future period when thickly peopled, will be of\r\ngreat value. Since England has taken possession of it, a period of only\r\ntwenty-five years, the export of sugar is said to have increased\r\nseventy-five fold. One great cause of its prosperity is the excellent\r\nstate of the roads. In the neighbouring Isle of Bourbon, which remains\r\nunder the French government, the roads are still in the same miserable\r\nstate as they were here only a few years ago. Although the French\r\nresidents must have largely profited by the increased prosperity of\r\ntheir island, yet the English government is far from popular.\r\n\r\n3_rd._—In the evening Captain Lloyd, the Surveyor-general, so well\r\nknown from his examination of the Isthmus of Panama, invited Mr. Stokes\r\nand myself to his country-house, which is situated on the edge of\r\nWilheim Plains, and about six miles\r\nfrom the Port. We stayed at this delightful place two days; standing\r\nnearly 800 feet above the sea, the air was cool and fresh, and on every\r\nside there were delightful walks. Close by a grand ravine has been worn\r\nto a depth of about 500 feet through the slightly inclined streams of\r\nlava, which have flowed from the central platform.\r\n\r\n5_th._—Captain Lloyd took us to the Rivière Noire, which is several\r\nmiles to the southward, that I might examine some rocks of elevated\r\ncoral. We passed through pleasant gardens, and fine fields of\r\nsugar-cane growing amidst huge blocks of lava. The roads were bordered\r\nby hedges of Mimosa, and near many of the houses there were avenues of\r\nthe mango. Some of the views where the peaked hills and the cultivated\r\nfarms were seen together, were exceedingly picturesque; and we were\r\nconstantly tempted to exclaim “How pleasant it would be to pass one’s\r\nlife in such quiet abodes!” Captain Lloyd possessed an elephant, and he\r\nsent it half-way with us, that we might enjoy a ride in true Indian\r\nfashion. The circumstance which surprised me most was its quite\r\nnoiseless step. This elephant is the only one at present on the island;\r\nbut it is said others will be sent for.\r\n\r\n\r\n_May_ 9_th._—We sailed from Port Louis, and, calling at the Cape of\r\nGood Hope, on the 8th of July we arrived off St. Helena. This island,\r\nthe forbidding aspect of which has been so often described, rises\r\nabruptly like a huge black castle from the ocean. Near the town, as if\r\nto complete nature’s defence, small forts and guns fill up every gap in\r\nthe rugged rocks. The town runs up a flat and narrow valley; the houses\r\nlook respectable, and are interspersed with a very few green trees.\r\nWhen approaching the anchorage there was one striking view: an\r\nirregular castle perched on the summit of a lofty hill, and surrounded\r\nby a few scattered fir-trees, boldly projected against the sky.\r\n\r\nThe next day I obtained lodgings within a stone’s throw of Napoleon’s\r\ntomb;[1] it was a capital central situation, whence I\r\ncould make excursions in every direction. During the four days I stayed\r\nhere I wandered over the island from morning to night and examined its\r\ngeological history. My lodgings were situated at a height of about 2000\r\nfeet; here the weather was cold and boisterous, with constant showers\r\nof rain; and every now and then the whole scene was veiled in thick\r\nclouds.\r\n\r\n [1] After the volumes of eloquence which have poured forth on this\r\n subject, it is dangerous even to mention the tomb. A modern traveller,\r\n in twelve lines, burdens the poor little island with the following\r\n titles,—it is a grave, tomb, pyramid, cemetery, sepulchre, catacomb,\r\n sarcophagus, minaret, and mausoleum!\r\n\r\n\r\nSt. Helena\r\n\r\nNear the coast the rough lava is quite bare: in the central and higher\r\nparts feldspathic rocks by their decomposition have produced a clayey\r\nsoil, which, where not covered by vegetation, is stained in broad bands\r\nof many bright colours. At this season the land, moistened by constant\r\nshowers, produces a singularly bright green pasture, which lower and\r\nlower down gradually fades away and at last disappears. In latitude\r\n16°, and at the trifling elevation of 1500 feet, it is surprising to\r\nbehold a vegetation possessing a character decidedly British. The hills\r\nare crowned with irregular plantations of Scotch firs; and the sloping\r\nbanks are thickly scattered over with thickets of gorse, covered with\r\nits bright yellow flowers. Weeping-willows are common on the banks of\r\nthe rivulets, and the hedges are made of the blackberry, producing its\r\nwell-known fruit. When we consider that the number of plants now found\r\non the island is 746, and that out of these fifty-two alone are\r\nindigenous species, the rest having been imported, and most of them\r\nfrom England, we see the reason of the British character of the\r\nvegetation. Many of these English plants appear to flourish better than\r\nin their native country; some also from the opposite quarter of\r\nAustralia succeed remarkably well. The many imported species must have\r\ndestroyed some of the native kinds; and it is only on the highest and\r\nsteepest ridges that the indigenous Flora is now predominant.\r\n\r\nThe English, or rather Welsh character of the scenery, is kept up by\r\nthe numerous cottages and small white houses; some buried at the bottom\r\nof the deepest valleys, and others mounted on the crests of the lofty\r\nhills. Some of the views are striking, for instance that from near Sir\r\nW. Doveton’s house, where the bold peak called Lot is seen over a dark\r\nwood of firs, the whole being backed by the red water-worn mountains of\r\nthe southern coast. On viewing the island from an eminence, the first\r\ncircumstance which strikes one is the number of the roads and forts:\r\nthe labour bestowed on the public works, if one forgets its character\r\nas a prison, seems out of all proportion to its extent or value. There\r\nis so little level or useful land that it seems surprising how so many\r\npeople, about 5000, can subsist here. The lower orders, or the\r\nemancipated slaves, are, I believe, extremely poor: they complain of\r\nthe want of work. From the reduction in the number of public servants,\r\nowing to the island having been given up by the East India Company, and\r\nthe consequent emigration of many of the richer people, the poverty\r\nprobably will increase. The chief food of the working class is rice\r\nwith a little salt meat; as neither of these articles are the products\r\nof the island, but must be purchased with money, the low wages tell\r\nheavily on the poor people. Now that the people are blessed with\r\nfreedom, a right which I believe they value fully, it seems probable\r\nthat their numbers will quickly increase: if so, what is to become of\r\nthe little state of St. Helena?\r\n\r\nMy guide was an elderly man who had been a goatherd when a boy, and\r\nknew every step amongst the rocks. He was of a race many times crossed,\r\nand although with a dusky skin, he had not the disagreeable expression\r\nof a mulatto. He was a very civil, quiet old man, and such appears the\r\ncharacter of the greater number of the lower classes. It was strange to\r\nmy ears to hear a man, nearly white and respectably dressed, talking\r\nwith indifference of the times when he was a slave. With my companion,\r\nwho carried our dinners and a horn of water, which is quite necessary,\r\nas all the water in the lower valleys is saline, I every day took long\r\nwalks.\r\n\r\nBeneath the upper and central green circle, the wild valleys are quite\r\ndesolate and untenanted. Here, to the geologist, there were scenes of\r\nhigh interest, showing successive changes and complicated disturbances.\r\nAccording to my views, St. Helena has existed as an island from a very\r\nremote epoch: some obscure proofs, however, of the elevation of the\r\nland are still extant. I believe that the central and highest peaks\r\nform parts of the rim of a great crater, the southern half of which has\r\nbeen entirely removed by the waves of the sea: there is, moreover, an\r\nexternal wall of black basaltic rocks, like the coast-mountains of\r\nMauritius, which are older than the central volcanic streams. On the\r\nhigher parts of the island considerable numbers of a shell, long\r\nthought to be a marine species, occur imbedded in the soil. It proves\r\nto be a Cochlogena, or land-shell of a very peculiar form;[2] with it I\r\nfound six other kinds; and in another spot an eighth species. It is\r\nremarkable that none of them are now found living. Their extinction has\r\nprobably been caused by the entire destruction of the woods, and the\r\nconsequent loss of food and shelter, which occurred during the early\r\npart of the last century.\r\n\r\n [2] It deserves notice that all the many specimens of this shell found\r\n by me in one spot differ as a marked variety from another set of\r\n specimens procured from a different spot.\r\n\r\nThe history of the changes which the elevated plains of Longwood and\r\nDeadwood have undergone, as given in General Beatson’s account of the\r\nisland, is extremely curious. Both plains, it is said, in former times\r\nwere covered with wood, and were therefore called the Great Wood. So\r\nlate as the year 1716 there were many trees, but in 1724 the old trees\r\nhad mostly fallen; and as goats and hogs had been suffered to range\r\nabout, all the young trees had been killed. It appears also from the\r\nofficial records that the trees were unexpectedly, some years\r\nafterwards, succeeded by a wire grass which spread over the whole\r\nsurface.[3] General Beatson adds that now this\r\nplain “is covered with fine sward, and is become the finest piece of\r\npasture on the island.” The extent of surface, probably covered by wood\r\nat a former period, is estimated at no less than two thousand acres; at\r\nthe present day scarcely a single tree can be found there. It is also\r\nsaid that in 1709 there were quantities of dead trees in Sandy Bay;\r\nthis place is now so utterly desert that nothing but so well attested\r\nan account could have made me believe that they could ever have grown\r\nthere. The fact that the goats and hogs destroyed all the young trees\r\nas they sprang up, and that in the course of time the old ones, which\r\nwere safe from their attacks, perished from age, seems clearly made\r\nout. Goats were introduced in the year 1502; eighty-six years\r\nafterwards, in the time of Cavendish, it is known that they were\r\nexceedingly numerous. More than a century afterwards, in 1731, when the\r\nevil was complete and irretrievable, an order was issued that all stray\r\nanimals should be destroyed. It is very interesting thus to find that\r\nthe arrival of animals at St. Helena in 1501 did not change the whole\r\naspect of the island, until a period of two hundred and twenty years\r\nhad elapsed: for the goats were introduced in 1502, and in 1724 it is\r\nsaid “the old trees had mostly fallen.” There can be little doubt that\r\nthis great change in the vegetation affected not only the land-shells,\r\ncausing eight species to become extinct, but likewise a multitude of\r\ninsects.\r\n\r\n [3] Beatson’s _St. Helena_. Introductory chapter, p. 4.\r\n\r\nSt. Helena, situated so remote from any continent, in the midst of a\r\ngreat ocean, and possessing a unique Flora, excites our curiosity. The\r\neight land-shells, though now extinct, and one living Succinea, are\r\npeculiar species found nowhere else. Mr. Cuming, however, informs me\r\nthat an English Helix is common here, its eggs no doubt having been\r\nimported in some of the many introduced plants. Mr. Cuming collected on\r\nthe coast sixteen species of sea-shells, of which seven, as far as he\r\nknows, are confined to this island. Birds and insects,[4] as\r\nmight have been expected, are very few in number; indeed I believe all\r\nthe birds have been introduced within late years. Partridges and\r\npheasants are tolerably abundant; the island is much too English not to\r\nbe subject to strict game-laws. I was told of a more unjust sacrifice\r\nto such ordinances than I ever heard of even in England. The poor\r\npeople formerly used to burn a plant which grows on the coast-rocks,\r\nand export the soda from its ashes; but a peremptory order came out\r\nprohibiting this practice, and giving as a reason that the partridges\r\nwould have nowhere to build!\r\n\r\n [4] Among these few insects I was surprised to find a small Aphodius\r\n (nov. spec.) and an Oryctes, both extremely numerous under dung. When\r\n the island was discovered it certainly possessed no quadruped\r\n excepting _perhaps_ a mouse: it becomes, therefore, a difficult point\r\n to ascertain, whether these stercovorous insects have since been\r\n imported by accident, or if aborigines, on what food they formerly\r\n subsisted. On the banks of the Plata, where, from the vast number of\r\n cattle and horses, the fine plains of turf are richly manured, it is\r\n vain to seek the many kinds of dung-feeding beetles which occur so\r\n abundantly in Europe. I observed only an Oryctes (the insects of this\r\n genus in Europe generally feed on decayed vegetable matter) and two\r\n species of Phanæus, common in such situations. On the opposite side of\r\n the Cordillera in Chiloe another species of Phanæus is exceedingly\r\n abundant, and it buries the dung of the cattle in large earthen balls\r\n beneath the ground. There is reason to believe that the genus Phanæus,\r\n before the introduction of cattle, acted as scavengers to man. In\r\n Europe beetles which find support in the matter which has already\r\n contributed towards the life of other and larger animals, are so\r\n numerous that there must be considerably more than one hundred\r\n different species. Considering this, and observing what a quantity of\r\n food of this kind is lost on the plains of La Plata, I imagined I saw\r\n an instance where man had disturbed that chain by which so many\r\n animals are linked together in their native country. In Van Diemen’s\r\n Land, however, I found four species of Onthophagus, two of Aphodius,\r\n and one of a third genus, very abundant under the dung of cows; yet\r\n these latter animals had been then introduced only thirty-three years.\r\n Previous to that time the kangaroo and some other small animals were\r\n the only quadrupeds; and their dung is of a very different quality\r\n from that of their successors introduced by man. In England the\r\n greater number of stercovorous beetles are confined in their\r\n appetites; that is, they do not depend indifferently on any quadruped\r\n for the means of subsistence. The change, therefore, in habits which\r\n must have taken place in Van Diemen’s Land is highly remarkable. I am\r\n indebted to the Reverend F. W. Hope, who, I hope, will permit me to\r\n call him my master in Entomology, for giving me the names of the\r\n foregoing insects.\r\n\r\nIn my walks I passed more than once over the grassy plain, bounded by\r\ndeep valleys, on which Longwood stands. Viewed from a short distance,\r\nit appears like a respectable gentleman’s country-seat. In front there\r\nare a few cultivated fields, and beyond them the smooth hill of\r\ncoloured rocks called the Flagstaff, and the rugged square black mass\r\nof the Barn. On the whole the view was rather bleak and uninteresting.\r\nThe only inconvenience I suffered during my walks was from the\r\nimpetuous winds. One day I noticed a curious circumstance: standing on\r\nthe edge of a plain, terminated by a great cliff of about a thousand\r\nfeet in depth, I saw at the distance of a few yards right to windward,\r\nsome tern, struggling against a very strong breeze, whilst, where I\r\nstood, the air was quite calm.\r\nApproaching close to the brink, where the current seemed to be\r\ndeflected upwards from the face of the cliff, I stretched out my arm,\r\nand immediately felt the full force of the wind: an invisible barrier,\r\ntwo yards in width, separated perfectly calm air from a strong blast.\r\n\r\nI so much enjoyed my rambles among the rocks and mountains of St.\r\nHelena that I felt almost sorry on the morning of the 14th to descend\r\nto the town. Before noon I was on board, and the _ Beagle_ made sail.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 19th of July we reached Ascension. Those who have beheld a\r\nvolcanic island situated under an arid climate will at once be able to\r\npicture to themselves the appearance of Ascension. They will imagine\r\nsmooth conical hills of a bright red colour, with their summits\r\ngenerally truncated, rising separately out of a level surface of black\r\nrugged lava. A principal mound in the centre of the island seems the\r\nfather of the lesser cones. It is called Green Hill: its name being\r\ntaken from the faintest tinge of that colour, which at this time of the\r\nyear is barely perceptible from the anchorage. To complete the desolate\r\nscene, the black rocks on the coast are lashed by a wild and turbulent\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nThe settlement is near the beach; it consists of several houses and\r\nbarracks placed irregularly, but well built of white freestone. The\r\nonly inhabitants are marines, and some negroes liberated from\r\nslave-ships, who are paid and victualled by government. There is not a\r\nprivate person on the island. Many of the marines appeared well\r\ncontented with their situation; they think it better to serve their\r\none-and-twenty years on shore, let it be what it may, than in a ship;\r\nin this choice, if I were a marine, I should most heartily agree.\r\n\r\nThe next morning I ascended Green Hill, 2840 feet high, and thence\r\nwalked across the island to the windward point. A good cart-road leads\r\nfrom the coast-settlement to the houses, gardens, and fields, placed\r\nnear the summit of the central mountain. On the roadside there are\r\nmilestones, and likewise cisterns, where each thirsty passer-by can\r\ndrink some good water. Similar care is displayed in each part of the\r\nestablishment, and especially in the management of the springs, so that\r\na single drop of water may not be lost: indeed the whole island\r\nmay be compared to a huge ship kept in first-rate order. I could not\r\nhelp, when admiring the active industry which had created such effects\r\nout of such means, at the same time regretting that it had been wasted\r\non so poor and trifling an end. M. Lesson has remarked with justice\r\nthat the English nation would have thought of making the island of\r\nAscension a productive spot, any other people would have held it as a\r\nmere fortress in the ocean.\r\n\r\nNear this coast nothing grows; farther inland an occasional green\r\ncastor-oil plant, and a few grasshoppers, true friends of the desert,\r\nmay be met with. Some grass is scattered over the surface of the\r\ncentral elevated region, and the whole much resembles the worse parts\r\nof the Welsh mountains. But, scanty as the pasture appears, about six\r\nhundred sheep, many goats, a few cows and horses, all thrive well on\r\nit. Of native animals, land-crabs and rats swarm in numbers. Whether\r\nthe rat is really indigenous may well be doubted; there are two\r\nvarieties as described by Mr. Waterhouse; one is of a black colour,\r\nwith fine glossy fur, and lives on the grassy summit, the other is\r\nbrown-coloured and less glossy, with longer hairs, and lives near the\r\nsettlement on the coast. Both these varieties are one-third smaller\r\nthan the common black rat (M. rattus); and they differ from it both in\r\nthe colour and character of their fur, but in no other essential\r\nrespect. I can hardly doubt that these rats (like the common mouse,\r\nwhich has also run wild) have been imported, and, as at the Galapagos,\r\nhave varied from the effect of the new conditions to which they have\r\nbeen exposed: hence the variety on the summit of the island differs\r\nfrom that on the coast. Of native birds there are none; but the\r\nguinea-fowl, imported from the Cape de Verd Islands, is abundant, and\r\nthe common fowl has likewise run wild. Some cats which were originally\r\nturned out to destroy the rats and mice, have increased, so as to\r\nbecome a great plague. The island is entirely without trees, in which,\r\nand in every other respect, it is very far inferior to St. Helena.\r\n\r\nOne of my excursions took me towards the south-west extremity of the\r\nisland. The day was clear and hot, and I saw the island, not smiling\r\nwith beauty, but staring with naked hideousness. The lava streams are\r\ncovered with hummocks, and are rugged to a degree which, geologically\r\nspeaking, is not of easy\r\nexplanation. The intervening spaces are concealed with layers of\r\npumice, ashes and volcanic tuff. Whilst passing this end of the island\r\nat sea, I could not imagine what the white patches were with which the\r\nwhole plain was mottled; I now found that they were sea-fowl, sleeping\r\nin such full confidence, that even in mid-day a man could walk up and\r\nseize hold of them. These birds were the only living creatures I saw\r\nduring the whole day. On the beach a great surf, although the breeze\r\nwas light, came tumbling over the broken lava rocks.\r\n\r\nCellular formation of volcanic bomb\r\n\r\nThe geology of this island is in many respects interesting. In several\r\nplaces I noticed volcanic bombs, that is, masses of lava which have\r\nbeen shot through the air whilst fluid, and have consequently assumed a\r\nspherical or pear-shape. Not only their external form, but, in several\r\ncases, their internal structure shows in a very curious manner that\r\nthey have revolved in their aërial course. The internal structure of\r\none of these bombs, when broken, is represented very accurately in\r\nPlate 103. The central part is coarsely cellular, the cells decreasing\r\nin size towards the exterior; where there is a shell-like case about\r\nthe third of an inch in thickness, of compact stone, which again is\r\noverlaid by the outside crust of finely cellular lava. I think there\r\ncan be little doubt, first, that the external crust cooled rapidly in\r\nthe state in which we now see it;\r\nsecondly, that the still fluid lava within was packed by the\r\ncentrifugal force generated by the revolving of the bomb, against the\r\nexternal cooled crust, and so produced the solid shell of stone; and\r\nlastly, that the centrifugal force, by relieving the pressure in the\r\nmore central parts of the bomb, allowed the heated vapours to expand\r\ntheir cells, thus forming the coarse cellular mass of the centre.\r\n\r\nA hill formed of the older series of volcanic rocks, and which has been\r\nincorrectly considered as the crater of a volcano, is remarkable from\r\nits broad, slightly hollowed, and circular summit having been filled up\r\nwith many successive layers of ashes and fine scoriæ. These\r\nsaucer-shaped layers crop out on the margin, forming perfect rings of\r\nmany different colours, giving to the summit a most fantastic\r\nappearance; one of these rings is white and broad, and resembles a\r\ncourse round which horses have been exercised; hence the hill has been\r\ncalled the Devil’s Riding School. I brought away specimens of one of\r\nthe tufaceous layers of a pinkish colour and it is a most extraordinary\r\nfact that Professor Ehrenberg[5] finds it almost wholly composed of\r\nmatter which has been organised; he detects in it some\r\nsiliceous-shielded, fresh-water infusoria, and no less than twenty-five\r\ndifferent kinds of the siliceous tissue of plants, chiefly of grasses.\r\nFrom the absence of all carbonaceous matter, Professor Ehrenberg\r\nbelieves that these organic bodies have passed through the volcanic\r\nfire, and have been erupted in the state in which we now see them. The\r\nappearance of the layers induced me to believe that they had been\r\ndeposited under water, though from the extreme dryness of the climate I\r\nwas forced to imagine that torrents of rain had probably fallen during\r\nsome great eruption, and that thus a temporary lake had been formed\r\ninto which the ashes fell. But it may now be suspected that the lake\r\nwas not a temporary one. Anyhow we may feel sure that at some former\r\nepoch the climate and productions of Ascension were very different from\r\nwhat they now are. Where on the face of the earth can we find a spot on\r\nwhich close investigation will not discover signs of that endless cycle\r\nof change, to which this earth has been, is, and will be subjected?\r\n\r\n [5] _Monats. der König. Akad. d. Wiss. zu Berlin,_ Vom April 1845.\r\n\r\nOn leaving Ascension, we sailed for Bahia, on the coast of\r\nBrazil, in order to complete the chronometrical measurement of the\r\nworld. We arrived there on August 1st, and stayed four days, during\r\nwhich I took several long walks. I was glad to find my enjoyment in\r\ntropical scenery had not decreased from the want of novelty, even in\r\nthe slightest degree. The elements of the scenery are so simple that\r\nthey are worth mentioning, as a proof on what trifling circumstances\r\nexquisite natural beauty depends.\r\n\r\nThe country may be described as a level plain of about three hundred\r\nfeet in elevation, which in all parts has been worn into flat-bottomed\r\nvalleys. This structure is remarkable in a granitic land, but is nearly\r\nuniversal in all those softer formations of which plains are usually\r\ncomposed. The whole surface is covered by various kinds of stately\r\ntrees, interspersed with patches of cultivated ground, out of which\r\nhouses, convents, and chapels arise. It must be remembered that within\r\nthe tropics the wild luxuriance of nature is not lost even in the\r\nvicinity of large cities: for the natural vegetation of the hedges and\r\nhill-sides overpowers in picturesque effect the artificial labour of\r\nman. Hence, there are only a few spots where the bright red soil\r\naffords a strong contrast with the universal clothing of green. From\r\nthe edges of the plain there are distant views either of the ocean, or\r\nof the great Bay with its low-wooded shores, and on which numerous\r\nboats and canoes show their white sails. Excepting from these points,\r\nthe scene is extremely limited; following the level pathways, on each\r\nhand, only glimpses into the wooded valleys below can be obtained. The\r\nhouses I may add, and especially the sacred edifices, are built in a\r\npeculiar and rather fantastic style of architecture. They are all\r\nwhitewashed; so that when illumined by the brilliant sun of mid-day,\r\nand as seen against the pale blue sky of the horizon, they stand out\r\nmore like shadows than real buildings.\r\n\r\nSuch are the elements of the scenery, but it is a hopeless attempt to\r\npaint the general effect. Learned naturalists describe these scenes of\r\nthe tropics by naming a multitude of objects, and mentioning some\r\ncharacteristic feature of each. To a learned traveller this possibly\r\nmay communicate some definite ideas: but who else from seeing a plant\r\nin an herbarium can imagine its appearance when growing in its native\r\nsoil? Who from seeing choice plants in a hothouse can\r\nmagnify some into the dimensions of forest trees, and crowd others into\r\nan entangled jungle? Who when examining in the cabinet of the\r\nentomologist the gay exotic butterflies, and singular cicadas, will\r\nassociate with these lifeless objects the ceaseless harsh music of the\r\nlatter and the lazy flight of the former,—the sure accompaniments of\r\nthe still, glowing noonday of the tropics? It is when the sun has\r\nattained its greatest height that such scenes should be viewed: then\r\nthe dense splendid foliage of the mango hides the ground with its\r\ndarkest shade, whilst the upper branches are rendered from the\r\nprofusion of light of the most brilliant green. In the temperate zones\r\nthe case is different—the vegetation there is not so dark or so rich,\r\nand hence the rays of the declining sun, tinged of a red, purple, or\r\nbright yellow colour, add most to the beauties of those climes.\r\n\r\nWhen quietly walking along the shady pathways, and admiring each\r\nsuccessive view, I wished to find language to express my ideas. Epithet\r\nafter epithet was found too weak to convey to those who have not\r\nvisited the intertropical regions the sensation of delight which the\r\nmind experiences. I have said that the plants in a hothouse fail to\r\ncommunicate a just idea of the vegetation, yet I must recur to it. The\r\nland is one great wild, untidy, luxuriant hothouse, made by Nature for\r\nherself, but taken possession of by man, who has studded it with gay\r\nhouses and formal gardens. How great would be the desire in every\r\nadmirer of nature to behold, if such were possible, the scenery of\r\nanother planet! yet to every person in Europe, it may be truly said,\r\nthat at the distance of only a few degrees from his native soil the\r\nglories of another world are opened to him. In my last walk I stopped\r\nagain and again to gaze on these beauties, and endeavoured to fix in my\r\nmind for ever an impression which at the time I knew sooner or later\r\nmust fail. The form of the orange-tree, the cocoa-nut, the palm, the\r\nmango, the tree-fern, the banana, will remain clear and separate; but\r\nthe thousand beauties which unite these into one perfect scene must\r\nfade away: yet they will leave, like a tale heard in childhood, a\r\npicture full of indistinct, but most beautiful figures.\r\n\r\n_August_ 6_th._—In the afternoon we stood out to sea, with the\r\nintention of making a direct course to the Cape de Verd\r\nIslands. Unfavourable winds, however, delayed us, and on the 12th we\r\nran into Pernambuco,—a large city on the coast of Brazil, in latitude\r\n8° south. We anchored outside the reef; but in a short time a pilot\r\ncame on board and took us into the inner harbour, where we lay close to\r\nthe town.\r\n\r\nPernambuco is built on some narrow and low sand-banks which are\r\nseparated from each other by shoal channels of salt water. The three\r\nparts of the town are connected together by two long bridges built on\r\nwooden piles. The town is in all parts disgusting, the streets being\r\nnarrow, ill-paved, and filthy; the houses tall and gloomy. The season\r\nof heavy rains had hardly come to an end, and hence the surrounding\r\ncountry, which is scarcely raised above the level of the sea, was\r\nflooded with water; and I failed in all my attempts to take long walks.\r\n\r\nThe flat swampy land on which Pernambuco stands is surrounded, at the\r\ndistance of a few miles, by a semicircle of low hills, or rather by the\r\nedge of a country elevated perhaps two hundred feet above the sea. The\r\nold city of Olinda stands on one extremity of this range. One day I\r\ntook a canoe, and proceeded up one of the channels to visit it; I found\r\nthe old town from its situation both sweeter and cleaner than that of\r\nPernambuco. I must here commemorate what happened for the first time\r\nduring our nearly five years’ wandering, namely, having met with a want\r\nof politeness; I was refused in a sullen manner at two different\r\nhouses, and obtained with difficulty from a third, permission to pass\r\nthrough their gardens to an uncultivated hill, for the purpose of\r\nviewing the country. I feel glad that this happened in the land of the\r\nBrazilians, for I bear them no good will—a land also of slavery, and\r\ntherefore of moral debasement. A Spaniard would have felt ashamed at\r\nthe very thought of refusing such a request, or of behaving to a\r\nstranger with rudeness. The channel by which we went to and returned\r\nfrom Olinda was bordered on each side by mangroves, which sprang like a\r\nminiature forest out of the greasy mud-banks. The bright green colour\r\nof these bushes always reminded me of the rank grass in a churchyard:\r\nboth are nourished by putrid exhalations; the one speaks of death past,\r\nand the other too often of death to come.\r\n\r\nCicada Homoptera\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most curious object which I saw in this neighbourhood was the reef\r\nthat forms the harbour. I doubt whether in the whole world any other\r\nnatural structure has so artificial an appearance.[6] It runs for a\r\nlength of several miles in an absolutely straight line, parallel to and\r\nnot far distant from the shore. It varies in width from thirty to sixty\r\nyards, and its surface is level and smooth; it is composed of\r\nobscurely-stratified hard sandstone. At high water the waves break over\r\nit; at low water its summit is left dry, and it might then be mistaken\r\nfor a breakwater erected by Cyclopean workmen. On this coast the\r\ncurrents of the sea tend to throw up in front of the land long spits\r\nand bars of loose sand, and on one of these part of the town of\r\nPernambuco stands. In former times a long spit of this nature seems to\r\nhave become consolidated by the percolation of calcareous matter, and\r\nafterwards to have been gradually upheaved; the outer and loose parts\r\nduring this process having been worn away by the action of the sea, and\r\nthe solid nucleus left as we now see it. Although night and day the\r\nwaves of the open Atlantic, turbid with sediment, are driven against\r\nthe steep outside edges of this wall of stone, yet the oldest pilots\r\nknow of no tradition of any change in its appearance. This durability\r\nis much the most curious fact in its history: it is due to a tough\r\nlayer, a few inches thick, of calcareous matter, wholly formed by the\r\nsuccessive growth and death of the small shells of Serpulæ, together\r\nwith some few barnacles and nulliporæ. These nulliporæ, which are hard,\r\nvery simply-organised sea-plants, play an analogous and important part\r\nin protecting the upper surfaces of coral-reefs, behind and within the\r\nbreakers, where\r\nthe true corals, during the outward growth of the mass, become killed\r\nby exposure to the sun and air. These insignificant organic beings,\r\nespecially the Serpulæ, have done good service to the people of\r\nPernambuco; for without their protective aid the bar of sandstone would\r\ninevitably have been long ago worn away and without the bar, there\r\nwould have been no harbour.\r\n\r\n [6] I have described this Bar in detail in the _ Lond. and Edin. Phil.\r\n Mag._ vol. xix, (1841) p. 257.\r\n\r\nOn the 19th of August we finally left the shores of Brazil. I thank\r\nGod, I shall never again visit a slave-country. To this day, if I hear\r\na distant scream, it recalls with painful vividness my feelings, when\r\npassing a house near Pernambuco, I heard the most pitiable moans, and\r\ncould not but suspect that some poor slave was being tortured, yet knew\r\nthat I was as powerless as a child even to remonstrate. I suspected\r\nthat these moans were from a tortured slave, for I was told that this\r\nwas the case in another instance. Near Rio de Janeiro I lived opposite\r\nto an old lady, who kept screws to crush the fingers of her female\r\nslaves. I have stayed in a house where a young household mulatto, daily\r\nand hourly, was reviled, beaten, and persecuted enough to break the\r\nspirit of the lowest animal. I have seen a little boy, six or seven\r\nyears old, struck thrice with a horse-whip (before I could interfere)\r\non his naked head, for having handed me a glass of water not quite\r\nclean; I saw his father tremble at a mere glance from his master’s eye.\r\nThese latter cruelties were witnessed by me in a Spanish colony, in\r\nwhich it has always been said that slaves are better treated than by\r\nthe Portuguese, English, or other European nations. I have seen at Rio\r\nde Janeiro a powerful negro afraid to ward off a blow directed, as he\r\nthought, at his face. I was present when a kind-hearted man was on the\r\npoint of separating forever the men, women, and little children of a\r\nlarge number of families who had long lived together. I will not even\r\nallude to the many heart-sickening atrocities which I authentically\r\nheard of;—nor would I have mentioned the above revolting details, had I\r\nnot met with several people, so blinded by the constitutional gaiety of\r\nthe negro as to speak of slavery as a tolerable evil. Such people have\r\ngenerally visited at the houses of the upper classes, where the\r\ndomestic slaves are usually well treated, and they have not, like\r\nmyself, lived amongst the lower classes. Such inquirers will ask\r\nslaves about their condition; they forget that the slave must indeed be\r\ndull who does not calculate on the chance of his answer reaching his\r\nmaster’s ears.\r\n\r\nHomeward bound\r\n\r\nIt is argued that self-interest will prevent excessive cruelty; as if\r\nself-interest protected our domestic animals, which are far less likely\r\nthan degraded slaves to stir up the rage of their savage masters. It is\r\nan argument long since protested against with noble feeling, and\r\nstrikingly exemplified, by the ever-illustrious Humboldt. It is often\r\nattempted to palliate slavery by comparing the state of slaves with our\r\npoorer countrymen: if the misery of our poor be caused not by the laws\r\nof nature, but by our institutions, great is our sin; but how this\r\nbears on slavery, I cannot see; as well might the use of the\r\nthumb-screw be defended in one land, by showing that men in another\r\nland suffered from some dreadful disease. Those who look tenderly at\r\nthe slave owner, and with a cold heart at the slave, never seem to put\r\nthemselves into the position of the latter;—what a cheerless prospect,\r\nwith not even a hope of change! picture to yourself the chance, ever\r\nhanging over you, of your wife and your little children—those objects\r\nwhich nature urges even the slave to call his own—being torn from you\r\nand sold like beasts to the first bidder!\r\nAnd these deeds are done and palliated by men who profess to love their\r\nneighbours as themselves, who believe in God, and pray that His Will be\r\ndone on earth! It makes one’s blood boil, yet heart tremble, to think\r\nthat we Englishmen and our American descendants, with their boastful\r\ncry of liberty, have been and are so guilty; but it is a consolation to\r\nreflect, that we at least have made a greater sacrifice than ever made\r\nby any nation, to expiate our sin.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the last day of August we anchored for the second time at Porto\r\nPraya in the Cape de Verd archipelago; thence we proceeded to the\r\nAzores, where we stayed six days. On the 2nd of October we made the\r\nshores of England; and at Falmouth I left the _Beagle_, having lived on\r\nboard the good little vessel nearly five years.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur Voyage having come to an end, I will take a short retrospect of the\r\nadvantages and disadvantages, the pains and pleasures, of our\r\ncircumnavigation of the world. If a person asked my advice, before\r\nundertaking a long voyage, my answer would depend upon his possessing a\r\ndecided taste for some branch of knowledge, which could by this means\r\nbe advanced. No doubt it is a high satisfaction to behold various\r\ncountries and the many races of mankind, but the pleasures gained at\r\nthe time do not counterbalance the evils. It is necessary to look\r\nforward to a harvest, however distant that may be, when some fruit will\r\nbe reaped, some good effected.\r\n\r\nMany of the losses which must be experienced are obvious; such as that\r\nof the society of every old friend, and of the sight of those places\r\nwith which every dearest remembrance is so intimately connected. These\r\nlosses, however, are at the time partly relieved by the exhaustless\r\ndelight of anticipating the long-wished-for day of return. If, as poets\r\nsay, life is a dream, I am sure in a voyage these are the visions which\r\nbest serve to pass away the long night. Other losses, although not at\r\nfirst felt, tell heavily after a period: these are the want of room, of\r\nseclusion, of rest; the jading feeling of constant hurry; the privation\r\nof small luxuries, the loss of domestic society and even of music and\r\nthe other pleasures of imagination. When such trifles are mentioned, it\r\nis evident that the real grievances,\r\nexcepting from accidents, of a sea-life are at an end. The short space\r\nof sixty years has made an astonishing difference in the facility of\r\ndistant navigation. Even in the time of Cook, a man who left his\r\nfireside for such expeditions underwent severe privations. A yacht now,\r\nwith every luxury of life, can circumnavigate the globe. Besides the\r\nvast improvements in ships and naval resources, the whole western\r\nshores of America are thrown open, and Australia has become the capital\r\nof a rising continent. How different are the circumstances to a man\r\nshipwrecked at the present day in the Pacific, to what they were in the\r\ntime of Cook! Since his voyage a hemisphere has been added to the\r\ncivilised world.\r\n\r\nIf a person suffer much from sea-sickness, let him weigh it heavily in\r\nthe balance. I speak from experience: it is no trifling evil, cured in\r\na week. If, on the other hand, he take pleasure in naval tactics, he\r\nwill assuredly have full scope for his taste. But it must be borne in\r\nmind how large a proportion of the time, during a long voyage, is spent\r\non the water, as compared with the days in harbour. And what are the\r\nboasted glories of the illimitable ocean? A tedious waste, a desert of\r\nwater, as the Arabian calls it. No doubt there are some delightful\r\nscenes. A moonlight night, with the clear heavens and the dark\r\nglittering sea, and the white sails filled by the soft air of a\r\ngently-blowing trade-wind, a dead calm, with the heaving surface\r\npolished like a mirror, and all still except the occasional flapping of\r\nthe canvas. It is well once to behold a squall with its rising arch and\r\ncoming fury, or the heavy gale of wind and mountainous waves. I\r\nconfess, however, my imagination had painted something more grand, more\r\nterrific, in the full-grown storm. It is an incomparably finer\r\nspectacle when beheld on shore, where the waving trees, the wild flight\r\nof the birds, the dark shadows and bright lights, the rushing of the\r\ntorrents, all proclaim the strife of the unloosed elements. At sea the\r\nalbatross and little petrel fly as if the storm were their proper\r\nsphere, the water rises and sinks as if fulfilling its usual task, the\r\nship alone and its inhabitants seem the objects of wrath. On a forlorn\r\nand weather-beaten coast the scene is indeed different, but the\r\nfeelings partake more of horror than of wild delight.\r\n\r\nLet us now look at the brighter side of the past time. The\r\npleasure derived from beholding the scenery and the general aspect of\r\nthe various countries we have visited has decidedly been the most\r\nconstant and highest source of enjoyment. It is probable that the\r\npicturesque beauty of many parts of Europe exceeds anything which we\r\nbeheld. But there is a growing pleasure in comparing the character of\r\nthe scenery in different countries, which to a certain degree is\r\ndistinct from merely admiring its beauty. It depends chiefly on an\r\nacquaintance with the individual parts of each view; I am strongly\r\ninduced to believe that as in music, the person who understands every\r\nnote will, if he also possesses a proper taste, more thoroughly enjoy\r\nthe whole, so he who examines each part of a fine view may also\r\nthoroughly comprehend the full and combined effect. Hence, a traveller\r\nshould be a botanist, for in all views plants form the chief\r\nembellishment. Group masses of naked rock even in the wildest forms,\r\nand they may for a time afford a sublime spectacle, but they will soon\r\ngrow monotonous. Paint them with bright and varied colours, as in\r\nNorthern Chile, they will become fantastic; clothe them with\r\nvegetation, they must form a decent, if not a beautiful picture.\r\n\r\nWhen I say that the scenery of parts of Europe is probably superior to\r\nanything which we beheld, I except, as a class by itself, that of the\r\nintertropical zones. The two classes cannot be compared together; but I\r\nhave already often enlarged on the grandeur of those regions. As the\r\nforce of impressions generally depends on preconceived ideas, I may add\r\nthat mine were taken from the vivid descriptions in the _Personal\r\nNarrative_ of Humboldt, which far exceed in merit anything else which I\r\nhave read. Yet with these high-wrought ideas, my feelings were far from\r\npartaking of a tinge of disappointment on my first and final landing on\r\nthe shores of Brazil.\r\n\r\nAmong the scenes which are deeply impressed on my mind, none exceed in\r\nsublimity the primeval forests undefaced by the hand of man; whether\r\nthose of Brazil, where the powers of Life are predominant, or those of\r\nTierra del Fuego, where Death and Decay prevail. Both are temples\r\nfilled with the varied productions of the God of Nature:—no one can\r\nstand in these solitudes unmoved, and not feel that there is more in\r\nman than the mere breath of his body. In calling up images of the past,\r\nI find that the plains of Patagonia\r\nfrequently cross before my eyes; yet these plains are pronounced by all\r\nwretched and useless. They can be described only by negative\r\ncharacters; without habitations, without water, without trees, without\r\nmountains, they support merely a few dwarf plants. Why, then, and the\r\ncase is not peculiar to myself, have these arid wastes taken so firm a\r\nhold on my memory? Why have not the still more level, the greener and\r\nmore fertile Pampas, which are serviceable to mankind, produced an\r\nequal impression? I can scarcely analyse these feelings: but it must be\r\npartly owing to the free scope given to the imagination. The plains of\r\nPatagonia are boundless, for they are scarcely passable, and hence\r\nunknown: they bear the stamp of having lasted, as they are now, for\r\nages, and there appears no limit to their duration through future time.\r\nIf, as the ancients supposed, the flat earth was surrounded by an\r\nimpassable breadth of water, or by deserts heated to an intolerable\r\nexcess, who would not look at these last boundaries to man’s knowledge\r\nwith deep but ill-defined sensations?\r\n\r\nLastly, of natural scenery, the views from lofty mountains, though\r\ncertainly in one sense not beautiful, are very memorable. When looking\r\ndown from the highest crest of the Cordillera, the mind, undisturbed by\r\nminute details, was filled with the stupendous dimensions of the\r\nsurrounding masses.\r\n\r\nOf individual objects, perhaps nothing is more certain to create\r\nastonishment than the first sight in his native haunt of a\r\nbarbarian,—of man in his lowest and most savage state. One’s mind\r\nhurries back over past centuries, and then asks, Could our progenitors\r\nhave been men like these?—men, whose very signs and expressions are\r\nless intelligible to us than those of the domesticated animals; men,\r\nwho do not possess the instinct of those animals, nor yet appear to\r\nboast of human reason, or at least of arts consequent on that reason. I\r\ndo not believe it is possible to describe or paint the difference\r\nbetween savage and civilised man. It is the difference between a wild\r\nand tame animal: and part of the interest in beholding a savage is the\r\nsame which would lead every one to desire to see the lion in his\r\ndesert, the tiger tearing his prey in the jungle, or the rhinoceros\r\nwandering over the wild plains of Africa.\r\n\r\nAmong the other most remarkable spectacles which we\r\nhave beheld, may be ranked the Southern Cross, the cloud of Magellan,\r\nand the other constellations of the southern hemisphere—the\r\nwaterspout—the glacier leading its blue stream of ice, overhanging the\r\nsea in a bold precipice—a lagoon-island raised by the reef-building\r\ncorals—an active volcano—and the overwhelming effects of a violent\r\nearthquake. These latter phenomena, perhaps, possess for me a peculiar\r\ninterest, from their intimate connexion with the geological structure\r\nof the world. The earthquake, however, must be to every one a most\r\nimpressive event: the earth, considered from our earliest childhood as\r\nthe type of solidity, has oscillated like a thin crust beneath our\r\nfeet; and in seeing the laboured works of man in a moment overthrown,\r\nwe feel the insignificance of his boasted power.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that the love of the chase is an inherent delight in\r\nman—a relic of an instinctive passion. If so, I am sure the pleasure of\r\nliving in the open air, with the sky for a roof and the ground for a\r\ntable, is part of the same feeling; it is the savage returning to his\r\nwild and native habits. I always look back to our boat cruises, and my\r\nland journeys, when through unfrequented countries, with an extreme\r\ndelight, which no scenes of civilisation could have created. I do not\r\ndoubt that every traveller must remember the glowing sense of happiness\r\nwhich he experienced when he first breathed in a foreign clime where\r\nthe civilised man had seldom or never trod.\r\n\r\nThere are several other sources of enjoyment in a long voyage which are\r\nof a more reasonable nature. The map of the world ceases to be a blank;\r\nit becomes a picture full of the most varied and animated figures. Each\r\npart assumes its proper dimensions: continents are not looked at in the\r\nlight of islands, or islands considered as mere specks, which are, in\r\ntruth, larger than many kingdoms of Europe. Africa, or North and South\r\nAmerica, are well-sounding names, and easily pronounced; but it is not\r\nuntil having sailed for weeks along small portions of their shores,\r\nthat one is thoroughly convinced what vast spaces on our immense world\r\nthese names imply.\r\n\r\nFrom seeing the present state, it is impossible not to look forward\r\nwith high expectations to the future progress of nearly an entire\r\nhemisphere. The march of improvement, consequent\r\non the introduction of Christianity throughout the South Sea, probably\r\nstands by itself in the records of history. It is the more striking\r\nwhen we remember that only sixty years since, Cook, whose excellent\r\njudgment none will dispute, could foresee no prospect of a change. Yet\r\nthese changes have now been effected by the philanthropic spirit of the\r\nBritish nation.\r\n\r\nIn the same quarter of the globe Australia is rising, or indeed may be\r\nsaid to have risen, into a grand centre of civilisation, which, at some\r\nnot very remote period, will rule as empress over the southern\r\nhemisphere. It is impossible for an Englishman to behold these distant\r\ncolonies without a high pride and satisfaction. To hoist the British\r\nflag seems to draw with it as a certain consequence, wealth,\r\nprosperity, and civilisation.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion it appears to me that nothing can be more improving to a\r\nyoung naturalist than a journey in distant countries. It both sharpens\r\nand partly allays that want and craving, which, as Sir J. Herschel\r\nremarks, a man experiences although every corporeal sense be fully\r\nsatisfied. The excitement from the novelty of objects, and the chance\r\nof success, stimulate him to increased activity. Moreover, as a number\r\nof isolated facts soon become uninteresting, the habit of comparison\r\nleads to generalisation. On the other hand, as the traveller stays but\r\na short time in each place, his descriptions must generally consist of\r\nmere sketches, instead of detailed observations. Hence arises, as I\r\nhave found to my cost, a constant tendency to fill up the wide gaps of\r\nknowledge by inaccurate and superficial hypotheses.\r\n\r\nBut I have too deeply enjoyed the voyage, not to recommend any\r\nnaturalist, although he must not expect to be so fortunate in his\r\ncompanions as I have been, to take all chances, and to start, on\r\ntravels by land if possible, if otherwise, on a long voyage. He may\r\nfeel assured he will meet with no difficulties or dangers, excepting in\r\nrare cases, nearly so bad as he beforehand anticipates. In a moral\r\npoint of view the effect ought to be to teach him good-humoured\r\npatience, freedom from selfishness, the habit of acting for himself,\r\nand of making the best of every occurrence. In short, he ought to\r\npartake of the characteristic qualities of most sailors. Travelling\r\nought\r\nalso to teach him distrust; but at the same time he will discover how\r\nmany truly kind-hearted people there are, with whom he never before\r\nhad, or ever again will have any further communication, who yet are\r\nready to offer him the most disinterested assistance.\r\n\r\nAscension.
