The wind that had held steadily to\r\nthe south for a week, now shifted suddenly to the northeast, coming\r\nas a furious blast. In a moment, it seemed, the mild Indian Summer\r\nbreeze was changed to a fierce winter gale.\r\n\r\nThe little schooner yacht that had been riding in the bay not more\r\nthan a half mile from the jagged, rocky shore line, began dancing\r\nabout like a cork. For a swell had come driving in from the ocean\r\njust as the wind changed, and now the two tall masts waved back and\r\nforth, bending in wide sweeps before the gale. Unfortunately for the\r\nlittle craft the change of the direction of the wind exposed it to\r\nthe storm’s full fury.\r\n\r\nThe captain, a weatherbeaten old Yankee who had sailed vessels of\r\nhis own as well as those belonging to other people for forty years,\r\nwas plainly worried. With a glass in his hand he scanned the shore\r\nline of the bay in every direction, occasionally giving a sharp\r\norder to the four sailors who hurried about the deck to carry out\r\nhis commands.\r\n\r\nThe only other persons on the yacht were a man and a boy who had\r\nbeen sitting together beside the forward mast when the wind changed.\r\nThe man was a tall, straight figure, with the erect carriage that\r\nsinewy, muscular men who are accustomed to hard work retain well\r\ninto old age. His face, with its leathery skin, which contrasted\r\nsharply with his iron gray beard, was softened by a pair of deep\r\nblue eyes--the kind of blue eyes that can snap with determination on\r\noccasion, in contrast to their usually kindly expression.\r\n\r\nObviously this man was past his prime, or, better perhaps, was past\r\nthat period of life reckoned in years that civilized man has become\r\naccustomed to speaking of as “prime.” Yet he was old only in years\r\nand experience. For his step was quick and elastic, and every\r\nmovement showed the alertness of youth. Were it not for the gray\r\nhairs peeping out from under his hat and his grizzled beard, he\r\nmight have passed for a man of forty. Martin MacLean was his name,\r\nand almost any one in the New Brunswick forest region could tell you\r\nall about him. For Martin was a famous hunter and guide, even in a\r\nland where almost every male inhabitant depends upon those two\r\nthings for his livelihood.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, then, this man was something quite out of the\r\nordinary among woodsmen. When the woods people gossiped among\r\nthemselves about their hunting and trapping experiences, old Martin\r\nwas often the theme of many a story. And the story was always one of\r\ncourage or skill.\r\n\r\nBut you must remember that in this land, deeds of courage and skill\r\nwere every-day occurrences. So that the man who could earn the\r\nadmiration of his fellow woodsmen must possess unusual qualities.\r\nMartin had repeatedly demonstrated these qualities. Not by any\r\nsingle act at any one time, but by the accumulated acts of many\r\nyears had he earned his title of leader in his craft.\r\n\r\nThe older woodsmen would tell you of the terrible winter when Martin\r\nhad made a journey of fifty miles through the forests to get\r\nmedicines from the only doctor within a hundred miles for a boy\r\ninjured by a falling tree. They would tell you of the time that a\r\nhunting party from the States were lost in the woods in a great\r\nNovember blizzard, and how Martin, frost-bitten and famished, had\r\nfinally found them and brought them back to the settlement. They\r\ncould tell of his fight with a wounded moose that had gored another\r\nhunter, and would have killed him but for the quick work of Martin’s\r\nhunting knife. Indeed, once the old hunter became the theme of their\r\ntalk, there was no end to the tales the woodsmen would tell of his\r\nadventures.\r\n\r\nThe boy who was with him on the yacht was obviously from an entirely\r\ndifferent walk of life. Any woodsman could have told you that he had\r\nbeen reared far from the country of lakes and forests. He was,\r\nindeed, a city boy, who except for one winter spent in the\r\nAdirondacks, had scarcely been beyond the suburbs of his native\r\ncity. In the north country he would have passed for a boy of twelve\r\nyears; but in reality he was just rounding his fifteenth birthday.\r\n\r\nHe was a medium sized boy for his age, with bright red hair, and a\r\nrosy complexion. He had the appearance of a boy just outgrowing a\r\n“delicate constitution” as one of the neighbor women had put it,\r\nalthough he had every appearance of robustness. Nevertheless it was\r\non account of his health that he was now on the little schooner\r\nyacht rolling in the gale of a bleak Labrador inlet. His neighbor in\r\nthe city, Mr. Ware, the owner of the yacht, thinking that a few\r\nweeks in the woods and on the water would be helpful to him, had\r\nmade him a member of his hunting party into the northern wilderness.\r\n\r\nThe old guide was obviously apprehensive at the fury of the gale\r\nthat had struck them, while the boy, Larry, seemed to regard it as a\r\nlark designed for their special amusement. Noticing the serious\r\nexpression of Martin’s face, and mistaking its meaning, he could not\r\nhelp jibing the old fellow, boy fashion, at his solicitude.\r\n\r\n“You look as if you thought we were going to the bottom sure enough,\r\nMartin,” Larry laughed. “Why, there isn’t any more danger on this\r\nboat than there is on an ocean liner. You’re no seaman, I can see\r\nthat.” And he threw back his bushy head and laughed heartily at his\r\ncompanion’s serious face.\r\n\r\n“Besides,” he added, “there’s the land only half a mile away even if\r\nwe did spring a leak or something. It’s only a step over there, so\r\nwe surely could get ashore.”\r\n\r\n“That’s just the trouble,” said a deep voice beside him. “That’s\r\njust the trouble. And if you knew the first thing about a ship or\r\nthe ocean you would know it.” And the captain strode aft, giving\r\norders to his seamen as he went.\r\n\r\n“What does he mean?” Larry asked of Martin, clinging to a brass\r\nstanchion to keep from being thrown into the scuppers as the little\r\nboat rolled heavily until the rail dipped the water.\r\n\r\n“Why, just this,” Martin told him. “The real danger to us now is\r\nthat we are so near the shore. Out in the open sea we could roll and\r\ntumble about and drift as far as we liked until the storm blew over.\r\nBut here if we drift very far we will go smash against those\r\nrocks--and that would be the end of every one of us.”\r\n\r\n“Well, if we went ashore why couldn’t we just jump and swim right to\r\nland a few feet away?” Larry asked, looking serious himself now, his\r\nblue eyes opening wide.\r\n\r\nMartin’s little laugh was lost in the roar of the wind.\r\n\r\n“That shows how much of a landlubber you are, Larry,” he said. “If\r\nyou had been brought up near the ocean you would know that if this\r\nboat struck on this shore where all the coast is a lot of jagged\r\nrocks, it would be smashed into kindling wood. And no man can swim\r\nin the waves at the shore. They pick a man up like a cork; but they\r\nsmash him down on those rocks like the hammer of the old Norse Sea\r\ngod. That is why the sailor prays for the open sea.”\r\n\r\nAll this time Martin had been clinging to the rail with one hand,\r\nand trying to scan the shore line with his hunting glasses. But the\r\nblinding spray and the ceaseless rolling and pitching made it\r\nimpossible for him to use them.\r\n\r\n“But I’m not worrying about what may happen to this boat,” he\r\nshouted presently, putting the glasses in his pocket. “Either we\r\nwill come out all right or else we won’t. And in any case we will\r\nhave to grin and take what comes. What I’m worried about is Mr. Ware\r\nand the fellows in the boat with him. If they have started out from\r\nshore to come aboard before this gale hit us they are lost, sure.\r\nAnd I am certain they had started, for I caught a glimpse of the\r\nboat coming out of a cove fifteen minutes before the storm broke.”\r\n\r\nFor a minute Larry stared at the old man, comprehending the\r\nseriousness of the situation at last. “You mean then--” he asked,\r\nclutching the brass rail as the boat lurched forward,--“You mean that\r\nyou think they will be drowned--really drowned, Martin?”\r\n\r\n“That’s it, Larry,” Martin replied, seriously. “They haven’t one\r\nchance in a thousand, as I see it. Even if they could reach us we\r\ncouldn’t get them aboard; and if they are blown ashore it will end\r\neverything. They haven’t a chance.”\r\n\r\nAs if to emphasize the seriousness of the situation the yacht just\r\nthen dug her nose deep into the trough of a great wave, then rose,\r\nlifting her bowsprit high in the air like a rearing horse tugging at\r\na restraining leash. It was a strain that tested every link of the\r\nanchor chain to its utmost. But for the moment it held.\r\n\r\n“A few more like that, Larry,” Martin shouted above the gale, “and\r\nthat chain will snap. The anchor is caught fast in the rocks at the\r\nbottom.”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the sailors and the captain were working desperately to\r\ncut loose the other anchor and get it over the side as their only\r\nchance of keeping the boat off the rocks. The gale, the rolling of\r\nthe vessel, and the waves buffeted them about, however, so that\r\nbefore they could release the heavy mass of iron, the yacht again\r\nplunged her nose into the waves, then rose on her stern, trembling\r\nand jerking at the single anchor chain. For a moment it held. Then\r\nthere was a sharp report, as a short length of chain flew back,\r\nknocking two of the sailors overboard, and gouging a great chunk of\r\nwood from the fore mast. At the same time the boat settled back,\r\ncareening far to port with the rail clear under.\r\n\r\nThe violence of the shock had thrown Larry off his feet, but for a\r\nmoment he clung to the railing with one hand. Then as the boat\r\nrighted herself, quivering and creaking, the flood of water coming\r\nover the bow tore loose his hands, and hurled him blinded and\r\nstupified along the deck. The next thing he knew he found himself\r\nlying in a heap at the foot of the narrow companionway stairs down\r\nwhich he had been thrown by the waves.\r\n\r\nHe was dazed and bruised by the fall, yet above the roar of the\r\nstorm, he heard faintly the howling of the huskie dogs, confined in\r\na pen on the forward deck. Then there was the awful roar of the\r\nwaves again, the crash of breaking timbers, and again a deluge of\r\nwater poured down the companionway. At the same time Larry was\r\nstruck with some soft, heavy object, that came hurtling down with\r\nthe torrent of water. Gasping for breath and half choked with the\r\nwater, he managed to cling to the steps until the water had rushed\r\nout through the scuppers as the boat heeled over the other way. Then\r\ncrawling on hands and knees he succeeded in reaching the cabin door,\r\nthe latch of which was not over six feet away.\r\n\r\nWith a desperate plunge he threw it open and fell sprawling into the\r\nroom. At the same time two great malamoot dogs, who had been washed\r\ndown the companionway with the preceding wave, sprang in after him,\r\nwhining and cowering against him. Even in his fright he could not\r\nhelp contrasting the present actions of these dogs with their usual\r\nbehavior. Ordinarily they were quiet, reserved fellows, given to\r\nminding their own business and imparting the general impression that\r\nit would be well for others to do the same. Now all their sturdy\r\nindependence was gone, and cowering and trembling they pressed close\r\nto the boy for protection, apparently realizing that they were\r\nbattling with an enemy against whom they had no defence.\r\n\r\nBut the storm gave Larry little time to think of anything but his\r\nown safety. Even as he struggled to rise and push the cabin door\r\nshut, the boat heeled over and performed that office for him with a\r\ncrash. The next moment a torrent of water rushed down the\r\ncompanionway, but only a few drops were forced through the cracks of\r\nthe door casing, fitted for just such an occasion, so that the cabin\r\nremained practically dry. Over and over again at short intervals\r\nthis crash of descending waters shook the cabin and strained at the\r\ndoor casing. And all the time the movements of the boat kept Larry\r\nlying close to the floor, clinging to the edge of the lower bunk to\r\nkeep from being thrown violently across the cabin.\r\n\r\nThe dogs, unable to find a foothold when the cabin floor rose\r\nbeneath them, were often thrown violently about the room, their\r\nclaws scratching futilely along the hard boards as they strove to\r\nstop the impetus of the fall. But the moment the boat righted\r\nitself, they crawled whimpering back and crouched close to the\r\nfrightened boy.\r\n\r\nLittle enough, indeed, was the protection or comfort Larry could\r\ngive the shivering brutes. He himself was sobbing with terror, and\r\nat each plunge and crash of the boat he expected to find himself\r\nengulfed by the black waters. Now and again, above the sound of the\r\nstorm, he heard the crash of splintering timbers, with furious blows\r\nupon the decks and against the sides of the hull. He guessed from\r\nthis that the masts had been broken off and were pounding for a\r\nmoment against the hull, held temporarily by the steel shrouds until\r\nfinally torn away by the waves.\r\n\r\nVaguely he wondered what had become of Martin, and the Captain, and\r\nthe two remaining members of the crew. Perhaps they had been washed\r\ndown the after companionway as he had gone down the forward one. But\r\nfar more likely they were now in their long resting place at the\r\nbottom of the bay. There seemed little probability that they had\r\nbeen as lucky as he, and he expected to follow them at any moment.\r\nYet he shut his teeth and clung fast to the side of the bunk.\r\n\r\nIt was terribly exhausting work, this clinging with one’s hands, and\r\nat each successive plunge he felt his grip weakening. In a very few\r\nminutes, he knew he should find himself hurled about the cabin like\r\na loose piece of furniture, and then it would only be a matter of\r\nminutes until he was flung against some object and crushed. He would\r\nnot be able to endure the kind of pounding that the dogs were\r\ngetting. The protection of their thick fur, and the ability to relax\r\nand fall limply, saved them from serious injury.\r\n\r\nLittle by little he felt his fingers slipping from the edge of the\r\nbunk. He shut his teeth hard, and tried to get a firmer grip. At\r\nthat moment the boat seemed to be lifted high into the air, and\r\npoised there for a breathless second. Then with a shock that bumped\r\nLarry’s head against the floor, it descended and and stopped as if\r\nwedged on the rocks at the bottom, with a sound like a violent\r\nexplosion right underneath the cabin.\r\n\r\nLarry, stupified by the crash, realized vaguely that the boat had\r\nstruck something and was held fast. In his confusion he thought she\r\nhad gone to the bottom, but he was satisfied that he was no longer\r\nbeing pounded about the cabin. And presently as his mind cleared a\r\nlittle, and he could hear the roar of the waves with an occasional\r\ntrickle of water down the companionway, he reached the conclusion\r\nthat they were not at the bottom of the sea. Nor did he care very\r\nmuch one way or the other at that time. It was pitch dark in the\r\ncabin, and as he was utterly worn out, he closed his eyes and lay\r\nstill, a big trembling dog nestling against him on either side. And\r\npresently he and his two companions were sleeping the dreamless\r\nsleep of the exhausted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n                       THE HOME ON THE ROCKS\r\n\r\n\r\nIt seemed only a moment later that Larry was roused by a thumping on\r\nthe planks over his head. Half awake, and shivering with cold, he\r\nrubbed his eyes and tried to think where he was. Everything about\r\nthe cabin could be seen now, a ray of light streaming in through the\r\nround port. For a little time he could not recall how he happened to\r\nbe lying on the cold floor and not in his bunk; but the presence of\r\nthe two dogs, still lying beside him, helped to freshen his memory.\r\n\r\nThe thumping on the deck seemed to have a familiar sound; there was\r\nsomebody walking about up there. Some one else must have been as\r\nlucky as he in escaping the storm. And presently he heard some one\r\ncome clumping down the companionway stairs. The dogs, who had been\r\nlistening intently with cocked ears to the approaching footsteps,\r\nsprang across the cabin wagging their tails and whining, and a\r\nmoment later old Martin stood in the doorway. He greeted the dogs\r\nwith a shout of surprise and welcome, followed by another even\r\nlouder shout when his eyes found Larry. For once the reserved old\r\nhunter relaxed and showed the depths of his nature. He literally\r\npicked the astonished boy up in his arms and danced about the little\r\nroom with delight.\r\n\r\n“Oh, but I am sure glad to see you, boy,” he said, when he finally\r\nlet Larry down on his feet. “I didn’t suppose for a minute that I\r\nshould ever see you or any one else here again--not even the dogs. I\r\nthought that you and everybody else went over the side when the\r\nfirst big wave struck us.”\r\n\r\n“Why, where are all the rest of them, and why is the boat so still?”\r\nLarry asked, eagerly.\r\n\r\nThe old man’s face grew grave at once at the questions.\r\n\r\n“Come out on deck and you can see for yourself,” he said quietly,\r\nand led the way up the companionway.\r\n\r\nWith his head still ringing, and with aching limbs and sore spots\r\nall over his body from the effects of bumping about the night\r\nbefore, Larry crawled up the companionway. He could hear the waves\r\nroaring all about them, and yet the boat was as stationary as a\r\nhouse. What could it mean?\r\n\r\nWhen he reached the deck the explanation was quickly apparent. The\r\nboat was wedged hard and fast in a crevice of rock, her deck several\r\nfeet above the water, and just below the level of the rocky cliff of\r\nthe shore. She had been picked up bodily by the tremendous comber\r\nand flung against the cliff, and luckily for them, had been jammed\r\ninto a crevice that prevented her slipping back into the ocean and\r\nsinking. For her bottom and her port side were stove in, and she was\r\ncompletely wrecked.\r\n\r\nFor a few minutes the boy stood gazing in mute astonishment. Old\r\nMartin also stood silently looking about him. Then he offered an\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\n“’Tisn’t anything short of a miracle, I should say,” he explained to\r\nLarry. “I have heard of some such things happening, but I never\r\nbelieved that they did really. You see the waves just washed\r\neverything overboard--captain, crew, masts, everything--except you and\r\nme, and the two dogs. It washed me just as it did you, but I went\r\ndown the after hatchway by luck, and I hung on down there in the\r\ncompanionway until the thing struck. But all the time that the waves\r\nwere washing over us we were being driven along toward this ledge of\r\nrock full tilt. And when we were flung against this rock we should\r\nby good rights, have been battered to kindling wood at one blow, and\r\nthen have slipped back into the water and sunk.\r\n\r\n“But right here is the curious part of it all. Just as she got to\r\nthe foot of this cliff, an unusually big comber must have caught\r\nher, raised her up in its arms fifteen or twenty feet higher than\r\nthe usual wave would have done, and just chucked her up on the side\r\nof this bluff out o’ harm’s way--at least for the time being. The\r\nsharp edge of the ledge happened to be such a shape that it held her\r\nin place like the barb of a fish-hook. And all that the smaller\r\nwaves could do was to pound away at the lower side of her, without\r\nhurting her enough to make her fall to pieces.\r\n\r\n“But of course they’ll get her after a while--almost any hour for\r\nthat matter; for this storm is a long way from being blown out yet,\r\nI’m afraid. And so it’s up to us to just get as much food and other\r\nthings unloaded and up away from this shore line as fast as we can.\r\nMost of the stores are forward, and that is where she is stove in\r\nthe least.\r\n\r\n“I suppose we’ve got to take off five minutes and cram a little cold\r\nfood into ourselves, so that we can work faster and longer. For we\r\nsurely have got to work for our lives to-day. If this boat should\r\nsuddenly take it into her head to slide off into the ocean again, as\r\nshe may do at any minute, we’re goners, even if we are left on\r\nshore, unless we get a winter’s supply unloaded and stored on the\r\nrocks. For we are a long way from civilization, I can tell you.”\r\n\r\nWith that Martin rushed Larry to the galley, dug out some bread,\r\ncold meat, and a can of condensed milk. And, grudging every minute’s\r\ndelay, they stood among the wreckage of the once beautiful cabin,\r\ncramming down their cold breakfast as hastily as possible. In the\r\nexcitement Larry forgot his bruises and sore spots.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they had finished Martin hurried the boy to the forward\r\nstore-room door, bursting it open with a heavy piece of iron.\r\n\r\n“Now pick up anything that you can handle,” he instructed, “run with\r\nit up on deck, and throw it on to the bank. I’ll take the heavier\r\nthings. But work as hard and as fast as you can, for our lives\r\ndepend upon it.”\r\n\r\nFor the next two hours they worked with furious energy rushing back\r\nand forth from the store-rooms, staggering up the tilted steps to\r\nthe deck, and hurling the boxes across the few feet that separated\r\nthe boat from the ledge. Every few minutes Martin would leap across\r\nthe gap, and hastily toss the boxes that had been landed further up\r\non the shore, to get them out of the way for others that were to\r\nfollow.\r\n\r\nThe enormous strength and endurance of the old hunter were shown by\r\nthe amount he accomplished in those two hours. Boxes and kegs, so\r\nheavy that Larry could hardly budge them, he seized and tossed\r\nashore in tireless succession, only pausing once long enough to\r\nthrow off his jacket and outer shirt. For the perspiration was\r\nrunning off his face in streams, despite the fact that the air was\r\nfreezing cold.\r\n\r\nFortunately most of the parcels were relatively small, as they had\r\nbeen prepared for the prospective inland hunting excursion which was\r\nto have been made on sledges. Many of the important articles were in\r\nsmall cans, and Larry rushed these ashore by the armful. He was\r\nstaggering, and gasping for breath at times, and once he stumbled\r\nand fell half way down a stairway from sheer exhaustion. But he had\r\ncaught Martin’s spirit of eager haste, and although the fall had\r\nshaken him up considerably, he picked himself up and went on as fast\r\nas his weary limbs would carry him.\r\n\r\nAt last Martin paused, wiping his face with his coat sleeve. “Sit\r\ndown and rest,” he said to the boy. “We’ve got a whole winter’s\r\nsupply on shore there now, if food alone was all we needed. So we\r\ncan take a little more time about the rest of the things; and while\r\nyou rest I’ll rig up some tackle for getting what we can of the\r\nheavier things ashore. You’ve done pretty well, for a city boy,” he\r\nadded.\r\n\r\nThen he went below, and Larry heard the sounds of blows and cracking\r\ntimber. Presently Martin appeared, dragging some heavy planks after\r\nhim. With these he quickly laid a bridge from the deck to the shore.\r\nThen he hunted out some long ropes and pulleys, and, carrying them\r\nto a tree far up on the bank, he rigged a block and tackle between\r\nthis anchorage and the yacht.\r\n\r\n“Now we’re ready for the heavy things,” he said.\r\n\r\nWith this new contrivance nothing seemed too big to handle. Martin\r\nand Larry would roll and push the heavy cases into a companionway,\r\nor near a hatch, and then both would seize the rope, and hand over\r\nhand would work the heavy object up to the deck across the bridge,\r\nand finally far out on shore. In this way the greater part of\r\neverything movable had been transferred from the boat by the middle\r\nof the afternoon; but not until the last of the more precious\r\narticles had been disposed of did Martin think of food, although\r\nthey had breakfasted at daylight.\r\n\r\nIn the excitement Larry, too, had forgotten his hunger; but now a\r\ngnawing sensation reminded him that he was famished. Martin was “as\r\nhungry as a wolf in winter” he admitted. But he did not stop to eat.\r\nCalling the dogs and filling his pockets with biscuit to munch as he\r\nwalked, he started out along the rocky shore of the inlet, to see if\r\nby any chance some survivor had washed ashore. Meanwhile Larry built\r\na big fire at the edge of the woods to act as a signal, and to keep\r\nhimself warm.\r\n\r\nIn two hours the old man returned from his fruitless search. He had\r\nfound some wreckage strewn among the rocks, but no sign of a living\r\nthing. “And now we must get these things under cover,” he said,\r\nindicating the pile of stores.\r\n\r\nFor this purpose he selected a knoll some little distance from the\r\nshore above where any waves could possibly reach. Over this he laid\r\na floor of planks, and spread a huge canvas over the boards. Then\r\nthey began the task of piling all the landed goods on top of this,\r\nlaying them up neatly so as to occupy as little space as possible,\r\nand over this great mound of food-boxes, gun-cases, canned goods,\r\nand miscellaneous objects, they pulled a huge canvas deck covering.\r\n\r\nBy the time they had finished the daylight was beginning to wane.\r\nTaking the hint from the approaching darkness, Martin dug into the\r\nmass of packages and produced a small silk tent, which he set up\r\nunder one of the scrub trees which was sheltered by a big rock well\r\nback from the shore.\r\n\r\n“Take that axe,” he told Larry, pointing to a carefully forged\r\nhunting axe that had been landed with the other things, “and collect\r\nall the wood you can before dark.”\r\n\r\nLarry, scarcely able to stand, looked wistfully at the yacht. “The\r\ncabin is dry in there,” he suggested, “why don’t we sleep in there\r\nto-night?”\r\n\r\nOld Martin shook his head. “I don’t dare risk it,” he said. “I am\r\ntired, and I’d sleep too soundly. I don’t think I’d wake up, no\r\nmatter what happened. And something may happen to-night. The storm\r\nis still brewing, and the waves are still so high that they pound\r\nthe old hull all the time. A little more hammering and she may go to\r\npieces. We couldn’t tell from the noise whether the storm was coming\r\nup or not, because there is so much pounding all the time anyway.\r\nAnd wouldn’t it be a fine thing for us to find ourselves dropped\r\ninto the ocean after we have just finished getting ourselves and our\r\nthings safely ashore? No, you get the wood and I’ll give you a\r\nsample of the out-door suppers that we are likely to have together\r\nevery night for the next few months.”\r\n\r\nLarry picked up the axe and dragged his weary feet off to the\r\nthicker line of trees a short distance away. There was really little\r\nuse for the axe, as the woods were filled with fallen trunks and\r\nbranches that could be gathered for the picking up. So he spared\r\nhimself the exertion of chopping and began dragging branches and\r\nsmall logs to the tent.\r\n\r\nHe found that the old hunter, while he was collecting the wood, had\r\nunearthed a cooking outfit, and had pots, pans, and kettles strewn\r\nabout ready for use. Best of all he had hunted out two fur sleeping\r\nbags, and had placed a pile of blankets in the little tent, which\r\nlooked very inviting to the weary boy.\r\n\r\nMartin saw his wistful look and chuckled. “Too tired to eat I\r\nsuppose?” he inquired.\r\n\r\n“Well, pretty near it,” Larry confessed. “I was never half so tired\r\nin my whole life.”\r\n\r\n“All right,” said Martin; “you’ve worked like a real man to-day. So\r\nyou just crawl into those blankets and have a little snooze while I\r\nand the doggies get the supper. I’ll call you when the things are\r\nready.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t you ever get tired, _ever_, Martin?” Larry asked as he flung\r\nhimself down. But if Martin answered his question he did not hear\r\nit. He was asleep the moment he touched the blankets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n                          THE FIRST SUPPER\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next thing Larry knew he was being roused by old Martin’s\r\nvigorous shakes. Something cold was pressing against his cheek,--the\r\nblack muzzle of one of the malamoots. Martin and the big dog were\r\nstanding over him, the man laughing and the dog wagging his bushy\r\ntail. It seemed to the boy that he had scarcely closed his eyes, but\r\nwhen he had rubbed them open he knew that he must have been asleep\r\nsome little time, for many things seemed changed.\r\n\r\nIt was night now, and the stars were out. But inside the tent it was\r\nwarm and cozy, for before the open flap a cheerful fire was burning.\r\nThe odor of coffee reached his nostrils and he could hear the bacon\r\nfrying over the fire, and these things reminded him that he was\r\nhungry again.\r\n\r\n“Sit right up to the table and begin,” Martin said to him, pointing\r\nto a row of cooking utensils and two tin plates on the ground in\r\nfront of the tent. “Every one for himself, and Old Nick take the\r\nhindmost.”\r\n\r\nNo second invitation was necessary. In a moment he was bending over\r\na plate heaped with bacon and potatoes, while the big malamoots sat\r\nwatching him wistfully keeping an expectant eye on Martin as he\r\npoured the coffee. Such potatoes, such bacon, and such coffee the\r\nboy had never tasted. Even the soggy bread which Martin had improved\r\nby frying in some bacon fat, seemed delicious. This being\r\nshipwrecked was not so bad after all.\r\n\r\nOld Martin, seated beside him and busy with his heaping plate seemed\r\nto read his thoughts.\r\n\r\n“Not such a bad place, is it?” he volunteered presently.\r\n\r\n“Bad?” the boy echoed. “It’s about the best place I ever saw. Only\r\nperhaps it will get lonesome if we have to wait long,” he added\r\nthoughtfully.\r\n\r\n“Wait?” repeated Martin, poising his fork in the air. “Wait for who\r\nand for what, do you suppose, boy?”\r\n\r\n“Well, aren’t we going to wait for some one to come for us?” the boy\r\ninquired.\r\n\r\nOld Martin emptied his plate, drank his third cup of coffee, and\r\nthrew a couple of sticks on the fire before answering.\r\n\r\n“If we waited for some one to come for us,” he said presently and in\r\na very serious tone, “we’d be waiting here until all these\r\nprovisions that we landed to-day are gone. And there’s a good full\r\nyear’s supply for us two up there under the canvas. Did you suppose\r\nwe are going to _wait_ here?”\r\n\r\nThe boy looked thoughtful.\r\n\r\n“But we can’t get the yacht off the rocks, and she’d sink if we did.\r\nAnd anyhow you couldn’t sail her home. You told me only yesterday\r\nthat you didn’t know a yacht from a battleship, Martin.”\r\n\r\n“I told you the truth, at that,” Martin chuckled. “But I’m something\r\nof a navigator all the same. I can navigate a craft as well as poor\r\nold Captain Roberts himself, only I use a different craft, and I\r\nnavigate her on land. And, what’s more to the point, I’ve got the\r\nland to do it on, the craft, and the crew.” And Martin pointed\r\nsuccessively at the pile of supplies in the distance, the two dogs,\r\nand Larry.\r\n\r\n“I don’t understand at all what you mean,” the boy declared; “tell\r\nme what you intend to do, Martin, won’t you?”\r\n\r\n“Why, boy, if I started in to tell you now you’d be asleep before I\r\ncould get well into the story,” said the old hunter.\r\n\r\n“No, I wouldn’t,” the boy protested. “I never was more wide awake in\r\nmy life. I feel as if I could do another day’s work right now.”\r\n\r\n“That’s the meat and potatoes and coffee,” old Martin commented.\r\n“It’s marvellous what fuel will do for a tired engine. Well, if you\r\ncan keep awake long enough I’ll tell you just what we are going to\r\ndo in the next few weeks--or months, maybe.\r\n\r\n“Here we are stranded away up on the Labrador coast, at least two or\r\nthree hundred miles from the nearest settlement, perhaps even\r\nfarther than that. And the worst of it is that I haven’t the least\r\nidea where that nearest settlement is. It may be on the coast,\r\nsomewhat nearer than I think; and then again it may be ’cross\r\ncountry inland still farther away than I judge. What we’ve got to do\r\nis to make up our minds where we think that settlement is, and find\r\nit. And we’ve got to go to it by land and on foot.”\r\n\r\n“On foot!” Larry cried in amazement. “Three or four hundred miles on\r\nfoot in the winter time in a strange country where nobody lives!”\r\n\r\n“That’s the correct answer,” the hunter replied: “and we’re two of\r\nthe luckiest dogs in the world to have the _chance_ to do it in the\r\nstyle we can. If we hadn’t been given the chance to save all that\r\nplunder from the ship to-day we would be far better off to be in the\r\nbottom of the ocean with Mr. Ware and the other poor fellows. But we\r\nhad the luck, and now we have a good even fighting chance to get\r\nback home. But it means work--work and hardships, such as you never\r\ndreamed of, boy. And yet we’ll do it, or I’ll hand in my commission\r\nas a land pilot.\r\n\r\n“Did you notice those cans of stuff that you were throwing ashore\r\nto-day--did you notice anything peculiar about those cans?” Martin\r\nasked, a moment later.\r\n\r\n“E--er, no I didn’t,” Larry hesitated. “Unless it was that some of\r\nthe bigger ones seemed lighter than tin cans of stuff usually do.”\r\n\r\n“That’s the correct answer again,” the old man nodded; “that’s the\r\nwhole thing. They _were_ lighter, for the very good reason that they\r\nare not made of tin. They are aluminum cans. They cost like the very\r\nsin, those cans do, many times more than tin, you know. But Mr. Ware\r\ndidn’t have to think about such a small thing as cost, and when he\r\nplanned this hunting trip, where every ounce that we would have to\r\nhaul by hand or with the dogs had to be considered, he made\r\neverything just the lightest and best that money could get it made.\r\nIf there was a way of getting anything better, or more condensed,\r\nwhether it was food or outfit, he did it. And you and I will\r\nprobably owe our lives to this hobby of his, poor man.\r\n\r\n“Among that stuff that we unloaded to-day there are special\r\ncondensed foods, guns, tents, and outfits, just made to take such a\r\nforced tramping trip through the wilderness as we are to take. You\r\nsee Mr. Ware planned to go on a long hunt back into the interior of\r\nthis land, a thing that has never been done at this time of year to\r\nmy knowledge. And as no one knows just what the conditions are\r\nthere, he had his outfit made so that he could travel for weeks, and\r\ncarry everything that he needed along with him.\r\n\r\n“So it’s up to us to take the things that Mr. Ware had made, and\r\nwhich we are lucky enough to have saved, and get back to the land\r\nwhere people live. In my day I have undertaken just as dangerous,\r\nand probably difficult things in the heart of winter; only on those\r\ntrips I didn’t have any such complete equipment as we have here.\r\n\r\n“Why, look at that sleeping bag, for example,” the old man\r\nexclaimed, pointing to one of the bags lying in the tent. “My\r\nsleeping outfit, when I hiked from upper Quebec clear to the shore\r\nof old Hudson’s Bay in the winter, consisted of a blanket. Whenever\r\nmy fire got low at night I nearly froze. But mind you, I could lie\r\nout of doors in one of these fur bags without a fire on the coldest\r\nnight, and be warm as a gopher. They are made of reindeer skin, fur\r\ninside, and are lined with the skin of reindeer fawn. So there are\r\ntwo layers of the warmest skin and fur known, between the man inside\r\nand the cold outside. Those bags will be a blessing to us every\r\nminute. For when we strike out across this country we don’t know\r\nwhat kind of a land we may get into. We may find timber region all\r\nthe way, and if we do there will be no danger of our freezing. But\r\nit’s more than likely that we shall strike barren country part of\r\nthe time where there will be no fire-wood; and then we will\r\nappreciate these fur bags. For I don’t care how cold it gets or how\r\nhard it blows, we can burrow down into the snow and crawl into the\r\nbags, and always be sure of a warm place to sleep.\r\n\r\n“Then again, the very luckiest thing for us was the saving of those\r\ntwo dogs,” Martin continued. “If they had gone overboard with the\r\nother twelve I should be feeling a good deal sadder to-night than I\r\nam. For there is nothing to equal a malamoot dog for hauling loads\r\nthrough this country in winter. Look at this fellow,” he said\r\nindicating one of the big shaggy dogs curled up a few feet from the\r\ntent, caring nothing for the biting cold. “There doesn’t seem to be\r\nanything very remarkable about him, does there? And yet that fellow\r\ncan haul a heavier load on a sled, and haul it farther every day,\r\nthan I can. And his weight is less than half what mine is.\r\n\r\n“The dogs that Mr. Ware had selected were all veteran sledge dogs,\r\nand picked because they had proved their metal. So we’ll give this\r\nfellow a load of two hundred and fifty pounds to haul. And he could\r\ndo better than that I know if he had to.”\r\n\r\nThe wind, which had died down a little at dusk, had gradually risen\r\nand was now blowing hard again, and fine flakes of snow and sleet\r\nhissed into the camp-fire. The rock which sheltered the tent\r\nprotected it from the main force of the blast, but Larry could hear\r\nit lashing its way through the spruce trees with an ominous roar.\r\nMartin rose and examined the fastenings of the tent, tightened a\r\nrope here and there, and then returned to his seat on the blankets.\r\n\r\n“We can’t start to-morrow if it storms like this,” Larry suggested\r\npresently.\r\n\r\n“Well, we can’t start to-morrow anyhow,” the old trapper answered.\r\n“And we surely can’t start until there is more snow. How are we\r\ngoing to haul a pair of toboggans over the snow if there is no snow\r\nto be hauled over, I’d like to know? But there is no danger about\r\nthe lack of snow. There’ll be plenty of it by the time we are ready\r\nto start.”\r\n\r\n“And when will that be?” the boy asked.\r\n\r\n“In about ten days, I think,” Martin answered, “----that is, if you\r\nhave learned to shoot a rifle, harness the dogs, pitch a camp, set\r\nsnares, walk on snow-shoes, and carry a pretty good-sized pack on\r\nyour back,” he added, looking at Larry out of the corner of his\r\neyes. “Did you ever shoot a rifle?”\r\n\r\n“Sure I have,” the boy answered proudly; “and I hit the mark,\r\ntoo--sometimes.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose you shot a Flobert twenty-two, at a mark ten feet away,”\r\nMartin commented with a little smile. “Well, all that helps. But on\r\nthis trip you are not going to hit the mark sometimes: it must be\r\nevery time. And the ‘mark’ will be something for the camp kettle to\r\nkeep the breath of life in us. I’ve been turning over in my mind\r\nto-day the question of what kind of a gun you are going to tote on\r\nthis trip. We’ve got all kinds to select from up there under the\r\ncanvas, from elephant killers to squirrel poppers, for Mr. Ware did\r\nlove every kind of shooting iron. I’ve picked out yours, and\r\nto-morrow you will begin learning to use it--learning to shoot quick\r\nand straight--straight, every time. For we won’t have one bullet to\r\nwaste after we leave here.”\r\n\r\nLarry fairly hugged himself. Think of having a rifle of his very\r\nown, a real rifle that would kill things, with the probability of\r\nhaving plenty of chances for using it! One of his fondest dreams was\r\ncoming true. The old hunter read his happiness in his face, and\r\nwithout a word rose and left the tent. When he returned he carried\r\nin his hand a little weapon which, in its leather case, seemed like\r\na toy about two feet long. Handing this to Larry he said, simply:\r\n“Here’s your gun.”\r\n\r\nThe boy’s countenance fell. To be raised to the height of bliss and\r\nexpectation, and then be handed a pop-gun, was a cruel joke. Without\r\nremoving the gun from its case he tossed it contemptuously into the\r\nblankets behind him.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Ware killed a moose with it last winter,” the old hunter\r\ncommented, suspecting the cause of the boy’s disappointment. “And it\r\nshoots as big a ball, and shoots just as hard as the gun I am going\r\nto carry,” he added. “You’d better get acquainted with it.”\r\n\r\nThere was no doubting the old man’s sincerity now, and Larry picked\r\nup the gun and examined it.\r\n\r\nIt was a curious little weapon, having two barrels placed one above\r\nthe other, and with a stock like a pistol. Attached to the\r\npistol-like handle was a skeleton stock made of aluminum rods, and\r\nso arranged that it folded against the under side of the barrels\r\nwhen not in use. The whole thing could be slipped into a leather\r\ncase not unlike the ordinary revolver holster, and carried with a\r\nstrap over the shoulder. When folded in this way it was only two\r\nfeet long, and had the appearance of the toy gun for which Larry had\r\nmistaken it.\r\n\r\nYet it was anything but a toy. The two barrels were of different\r\ncalibre, the upper one being the ordinary .22, while the lower one,\r\nas Martin had stated, was of large calibre and chambered for a\r\npowerful cartridge.\r\n\r\nThe old hunter watched the boy eagerly examining the little gun,\r\nopening it and squinting through the barrels, aiming it at imaginary\r\nobjects, and strutting about with it slung from his shoulder in the\r\npure joy that a red-blooded boy finds in the possession of a fire\r\narm. Then, when Larry’s excitement cooled a little, he took the gun,\r\nand explained its fine points to his eager pupil.\r\n\r\n“From this time on,” he began, “I want you to remember everything I\r\nam going to tell you just as nearly as you can, not only about this\r\ngun, but everything else. For you’ve got to cram a heap of knowledge\r\ninto your head in the next few days, and I haven’t time to say\r\nthings twice.\r\n\r\n“This gun was made specially for Mr. Ware after his own design and\r\nto fit his own idea. He wanted a gun that was as light as possible\r\nand could be carried easily, and at the same time be adapted to all\r\nkinds of game, big and little. This upper barrel, the smaller one\r\nyou see, shoots a cartridge that will kill anything up to the size\r\nof a jack rabbit, and is as accurate a shooter as any gun can be\r\nmade. Yet the cartridges are so small that a pocket full will last a\r\nman a whole season.\r\n\r\n“Now the best rule in all hunting is to use the smallest bullet that\r\nwill surely kill the game you are aiming at, and in every country\r\nthere are always ten chances to kill small things to one chance at\r\nthe bigger game. Up in this region, for example, there will be\r\nflocks of ptarmigan, the little northern grouse, and countless\r\nrabbits that we shall need for food, but which we couldn’t afford to\r\nwaste heavy ammunition on. And this smaller barrel is the one to use\r\nin getting them.\r\n\r\n“If you used the big cartridge when you found a flock of these\r\nptarmigans sitting on a tree, the noise of the first shot would\r\nprobably frighten them all away, to say nothing of the fact that the\r\nbig ball would tear the little bird all to pieces, and make it\r\nworthless for food. With the .22 you can pop them over one at a time\r\nwithout scaring them, and without spoiling the meat.\r\n\r\n“But suppose, when you were out hunting for ptarmigan or rabbits you\r\ncame upon a deer, or even a moose. All right, you’ve got something\r\nfor him, too, and right in the same gun. All you have to do is to\r\nshift the little catch on the hammer here which connects with the\r\nfiring-pin in the lower barrel, draw a bead, and you knock him down\r\ndead with the big bullet--as Mr. Ware did last fall up in New\r\nBrunswick. There will be a louder report, and a harder kick, but you\r\nwon’t notice either when you see the big fellow roll over and kick\r\nhis legs in the air.”\r\n\r\nThe very suggestion of such a possibility was too much for the boy’s\r\nimagination. “Do you really think that I may kill a deer, or a\r\nmoose, Martin?” he asked eagerly. “Do you, Martin?”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps,” the old man assented, “if you will remember all I tell\r\nyou. But first of all let’s learn all we can about the thing you are\r\ngoing to kill it with.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Ware and I had many long talks, and tried many experiments\r\nbefore he could decide upon the very best size of cartridge for this\r\nlarger barrel. You see there scores of different kinds and sizes to\r\nchoose from. There are cartridges almost as long and about the same\r\nshape as a lead pencil, with steel jacketed bullets that will travel\r\ntwo or three miles, and go through six feet thickness of wood at\r\nshort range. It is the fad among hunters these days to use that\r\nkind. But if a man is a real hunter he doesn’t need them.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Ware was a real hunter. When he pulled the trigger he knew just\r\nwhere the bullet was going to land. And when a man is that kind of a\r\nshot he doesn’t have to use a bullet that will shoot through six\r\nfeet of pine wood. So he picked out one of the older style of\r\ncartridges, one that we call the .38-40, which is only half as long\r\nas the lead-pencil kind. By using a steel jacketed bullet and\r\nsmokeless powder this cartridge is powerful enough to kill any kind\r\nof game in this region, if you strike the right spot.\r\n\r\n“So don’t get the idea, just because this gun won’t shoot a bullet\r\nthrough an old fashioned battleship, that it’s a plaything. It will\r\npenetrate eighteen inches of pine wood, and the force of its blow is\r\nvery nearly that of a good big load of hay falling off a sled. This\r\nlittle three-pound gun--just a boy’s sparrow gun to look at--shoots\r\nfarther and hits harder than the best rifle old Daniel Boone ever\r\nowned. And yet Boone and his friends cleaned out all the Indians and\r\nmost of the big game in several States. So you see you’ve got the\r\nbetter of Boone and all the great hunters and Indian killers of his\r\nday--that is, as far as the gun is concerned. To-morrow I will begin\r\nteaching you how to use it as a hunter should; but now we had better\r\nturn in, for there are hard days ahead of us.”\r\n\r\nAnd so Larry crawled into his snug fur-lined bag, too excited to\r\nwish to sleep, but so exhausted by the hard day’s work that his eyes\r\nwould not stay open.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n                        LESSONS IN PILOTING\r\n\r\n\r\nAt daylight the next morning old Martin roused the boy, reminding\r\nhim that he “was to begin learning his trade” that day. “And there\r\nare many things to learn about this land-piloting, too,” he told\r\nhim. Meanwhile the old hunter took the axe and went into the woods\r\nfor fuel while Larry was putting on his shoes and his coat--the only\r\ngarments he had removed on going to bed the night before.\r\n\r\nThe air was very cold and everything frozen hard, and Larry’s teeth\r\nwere chattering before Martin returned and started the fire. “Now\r\nnotice how I lay these sticks and make this fire,” Martin\r\ninstructed. “I am making it to cook our breakfast over, so I’ll\r\nbuild it in a very different way from what I should if I only wanted\r\nit for heating our tent. Learning how to build at least three\r\ndifferent kinds of fires is a very important part of your\r\neducation.”\r\n\r\nThe old man selected two small logs about four feet long and seven\r\ninches in diameter. He laid these side by side on the ground,\r\nseparating them at one end a distance of about six inches and at the\r\nother end something over a foot. In the space between the logs he\r\nlaid small branches and twigs, and lighted them, and in a jiffy had\r\na hot fire going.\r\n\r\nLarry noticed that Martin had placed the logs so that they lay at\r\nright angles to the direction from which the wind was blowing; and\r\nnow as the heat thawed out the ground, the hunter took a sharp\r\npointed stick and dug away the earth from under the log almost its\r\nwhole length on the windward side. The wind, sucking in under this,\r\ncreated a draught from beneath, which made the fire burn fiercely.\r\n\r\nThen Martin placed two frying pans filled with slices of ham and\r\nsoggy, grease-covered bread over the fire, the tops of the two logs\r\nholding the pans rigidly in place. Next he took the wide-bottomed\r\ncoffee pot, filled it with water, threw in a handful of coffee, and\r\nplaced the pot at the end where the logs were near enough together\r\nto hold it firmly.\r\n\r\n“Pretty good stove, isn’t it,” he commented, when he had finished.\r\n\r\n“You see that kind of a fire does several things that you want it\r\nto, and doesn’t do several others that you don’t want. It makes all\r\nthe heat go right up against the bottom of the pans where you need\r\nit most, and it only takes a little wood to get a lot of heat. What\r\nis more, the sides of the logs keep the heat from burning your face\r\nand your hands when you have to stir things, as a big camp-fire\r\nwould. You can always tell a woodsman by the kind of fire he\r\nbuilds.”\r\n\r\nPresently the coffee boiled over and Martin set it off, and by that\r\ntime the ham and the bread were ready. And while they were eating\r\ntheir breakfast he set a pail of water on the fire to heat. “That’s\r\nto wash the dishes in,” he said. “A real woodsman washes his dishes\r\nas soon as he finishes each meal--does it a good deal more\r\nreligiously than he washes his face or his hands, I fear.”\r\n\r\nWhen breakfast was finished, and the last dish cleaned, Martin said:\r\n“Now you’ll have an hour’s practice at target-shooting. Take your\r\ngun and come along.”\r\n\r\nHe led the way to the pile of boxes, and hunted out three or four\r\nsolid looking cases. These were filled with paper boxes containing\r\ncartridges--enough to supply an army, Larry thought. Tearing some of\r\nthese open, Martin instructed the boy to fill the right hand pocket\r\nof his jacket with the little twenty-twos. “And always remember that\r\nthey are in that pocket and nowhere else,” he instructed.\r\n\r\nNext he opened a bundle and took out a belt on which there were a\r\nrow of little leather pockets with snap fasteners. He filled these\r\npockets with the larger calibre cartridges, six to each pocket, and\r\ninstructed Larry to buckle it on over his coat. Then he led the way\r\nto a level piece of ground just above the camp, and having paced off\r\nfifty yards he fastened the round top of a large tin can against a\r\ntree and stepped back to the firing line.\r\n\r\n“I’ll try one shot first to see if the sights are true,” he said, as\r\nhe slipped a cartridge into each barrel. Then raising the gun to his\r\nshoulder he glanced through the sights and fired. “Go and see where\r\nthat hit,” he told the boy.\r\n\r\nLarry, running to the target, found the little hole of the .22\r\nbullet almost in the center of the tin, and shouted his discovery\r\nexultantly. Martin had fired so quickly after bringing the gun to\r\nhis shoulder that the boy could scarcely believe his eyes, although\r\nthe result of the shot did not seem to surprise the old hunter.\r\n\r\n“Don’t try the .38 yet,” he instructed, handing Larry the gun. “Fire\r\ntwenty shots with the .22, and go and see where each shot strikes as\r\nsoon as you fire and have loaded. And don’t forget to bring the gun\r\nto half-cock, and to load before you leave your tracks. That is one\r\nof the main things to remember. After a little practice you will do\r\nit instinctively, so that you will always have a loaded gun in your\r\nhands. It may save your life sometime when you run up to a buck that\r\nyou have knocked over and only stunned.”\r\n\r\nThe boy took the gun and began his lesson, the hunter leaving him\r\nwithout waiting to see how he went about it. A few minutes later,\r\nwhen Larry had finished the twenty rounds, he found the old man\r\ngoing through the dismantled yacht.\r\n\r\n“Just making a final inspection to see if there is anything left\r\nthat we may need,” the old hunter said. “There’s a king’s ransom in\r\nhere yet, but we can’t use it on our trip, and in another\r\ntwenty-four hours it may be on the bottom of the ocean.”\r\n\r\nLarry, trying to conceal the pride he felt, handed Martin the tin\r\ntarget he had brought with him. The old hunter examined it gravely,\r\ncounting the number of bullet holes carefully. There were ten of\r\nthem, including the one Martin had made.\r\n\r\n“Eleven misses in twenty shots,” he commented, simply.\r\n\r\nThe boy, who was swelling with pride, looked crestfallen.\r\n\r\n“But the last five all hit it,” he explained. “At first I hit all\r\naround it, and then I hit it almost every other time, and at last I\r\nhit it five times straight.”\r\n\r\n“Put up a new target and try ten more,” was Martin’s only comment.\r\nBut when Larry had gone he chuckled to himself with satisfaction.\r\n“Some shooting for a city boy!” he said to himself; “but I won’t\r\nspoil him by telling him so.”\r\n\r\nWhen Larry returned with the second target there were seven bullet\r\nholes in it; but still the old hunter made no comment on the score.\r\n“Now go back and try ten of the big ones, and remember that you are\r\nshooting at big game this time,” he admonished.\r\n\r\nLarry returned slowly to his shooting range. Martin was a very hard\r\nand unreasonable task-master, he decided. But, remembering that he\r\nhad hit the mark so frequently before, he resolved to better his\r\nscore this time. This was just the resolution Martin had hoped he\r\nwould make.\r\n\r\nSo the boy fastened the target in place, adjusted the hammer for\r\nfiring the larger cartridge. Then he shut his teeth together hard,\r\ntook a careful but quick aim, for Martin had explained that slow\r\nshooting was not the best for hunting, and pulled the trigger. The\r\nsound of the loud report startled him, and his shoulder was jerked\r\nback by the recoil. It didn’t hurt, exactly, for the aluminum butt\r\nplate was covered with a springy rubber pad; but it showed him very\r\nforcibly what a world of power there must be in those stubby little\r\ncylinders of brass and lead.\r\n\r\nHe forgot his astonishment, however, when on going to the target, he\r\nfound that the big bullet had pierced the tin almost in the center;\r\nand as he stood gazing at the hole he heard a low chuckle that\r\ncleared away all his dark clouds. Old Martin had slipped up behind\r\nhim quietly; and there was no mistaking the old hunter’s wrinkled\r\nsmile of satisfaction.\r\n\r\n“Now you see what you can do with her,” the old man said, his eyes\r\ntwinkling. “If that tin had been a moose’s forehead he’d be a dead\r\nmoose, sure enough. Did the noise and the kick surprise you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, it did,” Larry admitted honestly; “but it won’t next time--it\r\nnever will again. And I am going to kill just nine more moose with\r\nthese cartridges.”\r\n\r\n“That’s the way to talk,” said Martin, with frank admiration; “after\r\na few more shots you’ll get used to the recoil, and pretty soon you\r\nwon’t even feel it. But you musn’t expect to make nine more\r\nbull’s-eyes just yet.”\r\n\r\nThe old hunter went back to his work at the pile of plunder under\r\nthe big canvas, and Larry fired his nine remaining rounds. Then he\r\nsought the old man again, but as Martin asked no question about the\r\nresult of the shots, Larry did not volunteer any information.\r\nPresently Martin looked up from his work.\r\n\r\n“I suppose you’ve cleaned the rifle now that you have finished\r\npractice for the morning?” he inquired.\r\n\r\nLarry shook his head.\r\n\r\n“Well that’s the very first thing to do, now, and always,” said the\r\nhunter.\r\n\r\nIt took quite a time for the boy to clean and oil the gun so that he\r\nfelt it would pass inspection, and when he returned to Martin the\r\nold man was busy with an assortment of interesting looking parcels,\r\nplacing them in separate piles. He was making notes on a piece of\r\npaper, while both the dogs were sniffing about the packages, greatly\r\ninterested.\r\n\r\nThe old hunter sent Larry to bring two of the toboggans that he had\r\nsaved from the yacht. They looked like ordinary toboggans to the\r\nboy, but Martin called his attention to some of their good points\r\nwhich he explained while he was packing them with what he called an\r\n“experimental load,” made up from the pile of parcels he had been\r\nsorting.\r\n\r\nEach of the toboggans had fastened to its top a stout canvas bag,\r\nthe bottom of which was just the size of the top of the sled. The\r\nsides of the bag were about four feet high, each bag forming, in\r\neffect, a canvas box fastened securely to the toboggan. Martin\r\npointed out the advantages of such an arrangement in one terse\r\nsentence. “When that bag is tied up you can’t lose anything off your\r\nsled without losing the sled itself,” he said. “And if you had ever\r\ndone much sledging,” he added, “you’d know what that means.”\r\n\r\n“The usual way of doing it,” Martin explained, “is to pack your sled\r\nas firmly as you can, and then draw a canvas over it and lash it\r\ndown. And that is a very good way, too. But this bag arrangement\r\nbeats it in every way, particularly in taking care of the little\r\nthings that are likely to spill out and be lost. With this bag there\r\nis no losing anything, big or little. You simply pack the big things\r\non the bottom, and then instead of having to fool around half an\r\nhour fastening the little things on and freezing your fingers while\r\nyou do it, you throw them all in on top, close up the end of the\r\nbag, and strap it down tight. You see it will ride then wherever the\r\nsled goes, for it is a part of the sled itself.”\r\n\r\nLarry noticed that most of the larger parcels on the sled were done\r\nup in long, slender bags, and labeled. Martin explained that the\r\nbags were all made of waterproof material, and carefully sealed, and\r\nthat narrow bags could be packed more firmly and rode in place\r\nbetter than short, stubby ones. A large proportion of these bags\r\nwere labeled “Pemmican” and the name excited the boy’s curiosity.\r\n\r\n“It’s something good to eat, I know,” he said; “but what is it made\r\nof, Martin?”\r\n\r\n“It’s an Indian dish that made it possible for Peary to reach the\r\nPole,” Martin assured him. “It is soup, and fish, and meat and\r\nvegetables, and dessert, all in one--only it hasn’t hardly any of\r\nthose things in it. If you eat a chunk of it as big as your fist\r\nevery day and give the same sized chunk to your dog, you won’t need\r\nany other kind of food, and your dog won’t. It has more heat and\r\nnourishment in it, ounce for ounce, than any other kind of food ever\r\ninvented. That’s why I am going to haul so much of it on our sleds.”\r\n\r\nWhile he was talking he had slit open one of the bags and showed\r\nLarry the contents, which resembled rather dirty, tightly pressed\r\nbrown sugar.\r\n\r\n“Gee, it looks good!” the boy exclaimed. “Let’s have some of it for\r\nsupper.”\r\n\r\n“You needn’t wait for supper,” Martin told him. “Eat all you want of\r\nit, we’ve got at least a ton more than we can carry away with us.”\r\nAnd he cut off a big lump with his hunting knife and handed it to\r\nthe boy.\r\n\r\nLarry’s mouth watered as he took it. He had visions of maple-sugar\r\nfeasts on this extra ton of Indian delicacy close at hand, as he\r\ntook a regular boy’s mouthful, for a starter. But the next minute\r\nhis expression changed to one of utmost disgust, and he ran to the\r\nwater pail to rinse his mouth. He paused long enough, however, to\r\nhurl the remaining piece at the laughing hunter. But Martin ducked\r\nthe throw, while Kim and Jack, the dogs, raced after the lump, Kim\r\nreaching it first and swallowing it at a gulp.\r\n\r\n“What made you change your mind so suddenly?” the old hunter asked\r\nwhen he could get his breath. “You seemed right hungry a minute ago,\r\nand I expected to see you eat at least a pound or two.”\r\n\r\n“Eat that stuff!” Larry answered, between gulps from the water\r\nbucket. “I’d starve to death before I’d touch another grain of it.”\r\n\r\n“That’s what you think now,” the old man answered, becoming serious\r\nagain;--“that’s what I thought, too, the first time I tasted it. It\r\ntasted to me then like a mixture of burnt moccasin leather and boot\r\ngrease. But wait until you have hit the trail for ten hours in the\r\ncold, when you’re too tired to lift your feet from the ground, and\r\nyou’ll think differently. You’ll agree with me then that a chunk of\r\nthis pemmican as big as your two fists is only just one third big\r\nenough, and tastes like the best maple sugar you ever ate.”\r\n\r\nBut the boy still made wry faces, and shook his head. “What do they\r\nput into it to make it taste so?” he asked. “Or why don’t they\r\nflavor it with something?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, they flavor it,” Martin explained, laughing. “They flavor it\r\nwith grease poured all over it after they have dried the meat that\r\nit is made of, and pounded it up into fine grains. But take my word\r\nfor it that when you try it next time, somewhere out there in the\r\nwilderness two or three weeks from now, you’ll say that they flavor\r\nit just right.”\r\n\r\n“But we needn’t worry about that now,” he added. “What we need more\r\nthan anything else for to-night is a big lot of fire-wood, green and\r\ndry both. Take the axe and get in all you can between now and night.\r\nI want plenty of wood to use in teaching you how to make two other\r\nkinds of fires. Do you suppose you could cut down a tree about a\r\nfoot in diameter?”\r\n\r\nLarry thought he could. Some lumbermen in the Adirondacks had shown\r\nhim how a tree could be felled in any direction by chopping a deep\r\nnotch low down, and another higher up on the opposite side. He knew\r\nalso about stepping to one side and away from the butt to avoid the\r\npossible kick-back of the trunk when the tree fell.\r\n\r\nSo he selected a tree of the right size as near the tent as he could\r\nfind one, felled it after much futile chopping and many rests for\r\nbreath, and cut it into logs about six feet long. When he had\r\nfinished he called the two dogs, put a harness on each, hitched them\r\nup tandem, and fastened the hauling rope to the end of one of the\r\nlogs. Martin had suggested that he do this, so as to get accustomed\r\nto driving the dogs, and get the big fellows accustomed to being\r\ndriven by him.\r\n\r\nThe dogs, full of energy were eager for the work, and at the word\r\nsprang forward, yelping and straining at the straps, exerting every\r\nounce of strength in their powerful bodies. The log was a heavy one,\r\nand at first they could barely move it; but after creeping along for\r\na few inches it gradually gained speed on the thin snow, and was\r\nbrought into camp on the run. Even in the excitement of shouting to\r\nthe struggling dogs and helping with an occasional push, Larry\r\nnoticed the intelligence shown by the animals in swinging from one\r\nside to the other, feeling for the best position to get leverage,\r\nand taking advantage of the likely places.\r\n\r\nThey seemed to enter into the spirit of the work, too, rushing madly\r\nback to the woods after each log or limb had been deposited at the\r\ntent, and waiting impatiently for Larry to make up the bundles of\r\nwood and fasten the draw rope. Working at this high pressure the boy\r\nand dogs soon had a huge pile of fire-wood at Martin’s disposal, and\r\nby the time the old hunter had finished his task, had laid in a\r\nthree days’ supply.\r\n\r\n“Now you build a ‘cooking fire,’ such as I made this morning, and\r\nget supper going,” said Martin, coming over to the tent; “and while\r\nyou are doing that I’ll be fixing up another kind of a fire--one\r\ncalled a ‘trapper’s fire,’ which is built for throwing heat into a\r\ntent.”\r\n\r\nThe old hunter then drove two stakes into the ground directly in\r\nfront of the opening of the tent and six feet from it, the stakes\r\nbeing about five feet apart and set at right angles to the open\r\nflaps. Against these stakes he piled three of the green logs Larry\r\nhad cut, one on top of the other like the beginning of a log house,\r\nand held them in place by two stakes driven in front, opposite the\r\ntwo first stakes. Next he selected two green sticks about four\r\ninches in diameter and three feet long, and placed them like the\r\nandirons in a fireplace, the wall of logs serving as a reflecting\r\nsurface like the back wall of a chimney. Across these logs he now\r\nlaid a fire, just as one would in a fireplace.\r\n\r\nLarry all this time had been busy getting the supper, Martin\r\noffering a suggestion now and then. When he saw that the meal was\r\nalmost ready the old man spread a piece of canvas on the ground just\r\ninside the opening of the tent and before the log fire he had laid,\r\nand set out the plates and cups, and when Larry announced that the\r\nfeast was ready Martin lighted the fire in front of the logs.\r\n\r\nHe had a double motive in this--to show the boy how to make a heating\r\nfire and to furnish heat for the evening. For the weather was\r\ngrowing very cold, and he had some work that he wished to do which\r\nwould require light to guide his fingers and heat for keeping them\r\nwarm.\r\n\r\nWith the protection of the tent back of them and the roaring fire in\r\nfront they toasted their shins and ate leisurely. To Larry it all\r\nseemed like one grand lark, and he said so.\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid you will change your mind about it being such a lark\r\nbefore we are through with it,” the old man said presently. “It\r\nwon’t be a lark for either of us. But I’m beginning to feel more\r\nhopeful about it, now that I see that you can learn things, and are\r\nwilling to try.”\r\n\r\nHe lighted his pipe and smoked thoughtfully for a few minutes. Larry\r\ntoo, was thoughtful, turning over in his mind the old hunter’s last\r\nremark.\r\n\r\n“And so you have been thinking all this time that I might be in the\r\nway--that perhaps you would be better off if you were alone, and\r\ndidn’t have a boy like me on your hands?” the boy asked presently.\r\n\r\nFor a little time the old man did not answer, puffing his pipe and\r\ngazing silently at the fire. At last he said:\r\n\r\n“I couldn’t help feeling a little that way at first, Larry. The job\r\non our hands is one for a strong man, not for a city boy. But I’m\r\nfeeling different now that I see how you take hold and are willing\r\nto work, and try to learn all the things I tell you. And wouldn’t it\r\nbe funny,” he added, with a twinkle in his kindly eye, “if,\r\nsometime, I should get into trouble and you have to help me out of\r\nit instead of my helping you all the time? A fellow can never tell\r\nwhat strange things may happen on the trail; and that is one reason\r\nwhy no man should start on a journey through the woods in the winter\r\ntime alone.”\r\n\r\nPresently the old man knocked the ashes from his pipe and set about\r\ncleaning the dishes, Larry helping him; but neither of them were in\r\ntalking mood, each busy with his own thoughts. When they had\r\nfinished the hunter said:\r\n\r\n“Now I’ll show you how to make an Indian fire, the kind the Indian\r\nstill likes best of all, and the best kind to use when wood is\r\nscarce or when you want to boil a pot of tea or get a quick meal.”\r\n\r\nThe old hunter then gathered an armful of small limbs, and laid them\r\non the ground in a circle like the spokes of a wheel, the butts\r\nover-lapping at the center where the hub of the wheel would be. With\r\na few small twigs he lighted a fire where the butts joined, the\r\nflames catching quickly and burning in a fierce vertical flame.\r\n\r\n“This fire will make the most heat for the least amount of wood and\r\nthrow the heat in all directions,” Martin explained. “And that is\r\nwhy it is the best kind of a fire for heating a round tent, such as\r\nan Indian tepee.”\r\n\r\n“But why did the Indian have to care about the amount of wood he\r\nburned?” Larry asked. “He had all the wood he wanted, just for the\r\nchopping of it, didn’t he?”\r\n\r\nThe old man smiled indulgently. “Yes, he surely had all the wood he\r\nwanted just for the chopping--millions of cords of it. But how was he\r\ngoing to chop it without anything to chop it with, do you think? You\r\nforget that the old Indians didn’t have so much as a knife, let\r\nalone an axe. And that explains the whole thing: that’s why the\r\nIndian made small fires and built skin tepees instead of log houses.\r\n\r\n“If you left your axe and your knife here at the tent and went into\r\nthe woods to gather wood, Larry, how long do you suppose it would\r\ntake you to collect a day’s supply for our big fire? You wouldn’t\r\nhave much trouble in getting a few armfuls of fallen and broken\r\nbranches but very soon you’d find the supply running short. The logs\r\nwould be too large to handle, and most of the limbs too big to\r\nbreak. And so you would soon be cold and hungry, with a month’s\r\nsupply of dry timber right at your front dooryard.\r\n\r\n“But it’s all so different when you can give a tap here and there\r\nwith your axe, or a few strokes with your hunting knife. And this\r\nwas just what the poor Indian couldn’t do; for he had no cutting\r\ntool of any kind worth the name until the white man came. So he\r\nlearned to use little sticks for his fire, and built his house of\r\nskins stretched over small poles.\r\n\r\n“It is hard for us to realize that cutting down a tree was about the\r\nhardest task an Indian could ever attempt. Why the strongest Indian\r\nin the tribe, working as hard as he could with the best tool he\r\ncould find, couldn’t cut down a tree as quickly as you could with\r\nyour hunting knife. He could break rocks to pieces by striking them\r\nwith other rocks, and he could dig caves in the earth; but when it\r\ncame to cutting down a tree he was stumped. The big trees simply\r\nstood up and laughed at him. No wonder he worshipped the forests and\r\nthe tree gods!\r\n\r\n“Of course when the white man came and supplied axes, hatchets, and\r\nknives, he solved the problem of fire-wood for the Indian. But he\r\nnever changed the Indian’s idea about small fires. Too many thousand\r\ngenerations of Indian ancestors had been making that kind of a fire\r\nall their lives; and the Indian is a great fellow to stick to fixed\r\nhabits. He adopted the steel hatchet and the knife, but he stuck to\r\nhis round fire and his round tepee.\r\n\r\n“And yet, although he had never seen a steel hatchet until the white\r\nman gave him one, he improved the design of the white man’s axe\r\nright away. The white man’s hatchet was a broad-bladed, clumsy\r\nthing, heavy to carry and hard to handle. The Indian designed a\r\nthin, narrow-bladed, light hatchet--the tomahawk--that would bite\r\ndeeper into the wood and so cut faster than the white man’s thick\r\nhatchet. And every woodsman now knows that for fast chopping, with\r\nlittle work, a hatchet made on the lines of the tomahawk beats out\r\nthe other kind.”\r\n\r\nThe old man took his own hunting axe from the sheath at his belt and\r\nheld it up for inspection.\r\n\r\n“You see it’s just a modified tomahawk,” he said, “with long blade\r\nand thin head, and only a little toy axe, to look at. But it has cut\r\ndown many good-sized trees when I needed them, all the same. And the\r\naxe you were using this afternoon, as you probably noticed, is\r\nsimply a bigger brother of this little fellow, exactly the same\r\nshape. It’s the kind the trappers use in the far North, because it\r\nwill do all the work of a four-pound axe, and is only half as heavy.\r\nWe’ve got some of those big axes over there under the tarpaulin, but\r\nwe’ll leave them behind when we hit the trail, and take that small\r\none with us.”\r\n\r\nWhile they were talking Martin had been getting out a parcel\r\ncontaining clothing and odds and ends, and now he sat down before\r\nthe fire to “do some work” as he expressed it.\r\n\r\n“If you’re not too sleepy to listen,” he said, “I’ll tell you a\r\nstory that I know about a little Algonquin Indian boy.”\r\n\r\nLarry was never too tired to listen to Martin’s stories; and so he\r\ncurled up on a blanket before the fire, while the old man worked and\r\ntalked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n                   THE STORY OF WEEWAH THE HUNTER\r\n\r\n\r\nIt had been a hard day’s work for both of them, and strange as\r\neverything was to Larry, and awful as the black woods seemed as he\r\npeeped out beyond the light of the fire, he had a strange feeling of\r\nsecurity and contentment. It might be that there were terribly hard\r\ndays of toil and danger and privations ahead, but he was too cozily\r\nsituated now to let that worry him.\r\n\r\nBesides he was feeling the satisfaction that every boy feels in the\r\nknowledge that he has done something well. And even the exacting old\r\nMartin, always slow to praise or even commend, had told him over his\r\ncup of tea and his soup at supper, that he “would make a hunter of\r\nhim some day.” And what higher praise could a boy hope for?\r\n\r\n“Nobody knows just how old Weewah was when he became a mighty\r\nhunter,” Martin began presently, without looking up from his sewing,\r\n“because Indians don’t keep track of those things as we white folks\r\ndo. But he couldn’t have been any older than you are, perhaps not\r\nquite so old.\r\n\r\n“He was old enough to know how to handle his bow and arrows, though,\r\nto draw a strong enough bow to shoot an arrow clean through a\r\nwoodchuck or a muskrat, or even a beaver, although he had never\r\nfound the chance to try at the beaver. He carried his own tomahawk,\r\ntoo--a new one that the factor at Hudson Bay Post had given him,--and\r\nwas eager to show his prowess with it on larger game.\r\n\r\n“But the hunting was done by the grown up men of the village, who\r\nthought Weewah too small to hunt anything larger than rabbits. Yet\r\nthere were other boys of his own age who found more favor in the\r\nhunters’ eyes because they were larger than he. ‘Some day you will\r\nbe a hunter,’ they told him, ‘but now you are too small.’\r\n\r\n“Weewah’s heart was big, even if his body was small. And so one day\r\nhe took all his long arrows, his strongest bow, and his tomahawk and\r\nresolved to go into the big woods at some distance from the village,\r\nand do something worthy of a hunter.\r\n\r\n“It was winter time, and the snow on the ground was knee-deep with\r\njust a little crust on it. On his snow-shoes Weewah glided through\r\nthe forest, noticing everything he passed and fixing it in his\r\nmemory instinctively so that he could be sure of finding the back\r\ntrail. For this day he meant to go deep, deep into the spruce swamp\r\nin his hunting. There he would find game worthy of the bow of the\r\nmighty hunter he intended to prove himself.\r\n\r\n“The tracks of many animals crossed his path, little wood dwellers\r\nsuch as rabbits and an occasional mink. But these did not interest\r\nhim to-day. He had brought his snares, of course, for he always\r\ncarried them; but to-day his heart was too full of a mighty ambition\r\nto allow such little things as rabbit snares to interrupt his plans.\r\n\r\n“Once he did stop when he saw, just ahead of him on the snow, a\r\nlittle brown bunch of fur with two big brown eyes looking at him\r\nwonderingly. In an instant he had drawn the poised arrow to his\r\ncheek and released it with a twang. And a moment later the little\r\nbrown bunch of fur was in Weewah’s pouch, ready for making into\r\nrabbit stew in the evening.\r\n\r\n“Weewah took it as a good omen that he had killed the rabbit on the\r\nvery edge of the spruce swamp that he had selected for his hunting\r\nground. Soon he would find game more worthy of his arrows or his\r\naxe. And so he was not surprised, even if his heart did give an\r\nextra bound, when presently he came upon the track of a lynx. It was\r\na fresh track, too, and the footprints were those of a very big\r\nlynx.\r\n\r\n“Weewah knew all this the moment he looked at the tracks, just as he\r\nknew a thousand other things that he had learned in the school of\r\nobservation. He knew also that in all probability the animal was not\r\nhalf a mile away, possibly waiting in some tree, or crouching in\r\nsome bushes looking for ptarmigan or rabbit. He was sure, also, that\r\nhe could run faster on his snow-shoes than the lynx could in that\r\ndeep soft snow.\r\n\r\n“So for several minutes he stood and thought as fast as he could.\r\nWhat a grand day for him it would be if he could come back to the\r\nvillage dragging a great lynx after him! No one would ever tell him\r\nagain that he was too small to be a hunter.\r\n\r\n“But while he was sorely tempted to rush after the animal with the\r\npossibility of getting a shot, or a chance for a blow of his axe, he\r\nknew that this was not the surest way to get his prey. He had\r\ndiscovered the hunting ground of the big cat, and he knew that there\r\nwas no danger of its leaving the neighborhood so long as the supply\r\nof rabbits held out. By taking a little more time, then, Weewah knew\r\nhe could surely bring the fellow into camp. And so he curbed his\r\neagerness.\r\n\r\n“Instead of rushing off along the trail, bow bent and arrow on the\r\nstring, he opened his pouch and took out a stout buckskin string--a\r\nstring strong enough to resist the pull of the largest lynx. In one\r\nend of this he made a noose with a running knot. Next he cut a stout\r\nstick three inches thick and as tall as himself. Then he walked\r\nalong the trail of the lynx for a little distance, looking sharply\r\non either side, until he found a low-hanging, thick bunch of spruce\r\nboughs near which the animal had passed. Here the boy stopped and\r\ncut two more strong sticks, driving them into the ground about two\r\nfeet apart, so that they stood three feet above the snow and right\r\nin front of a low-hanging bunch of spruce boughs.\r\n\r\n“At the top of each he had left a crotch, across which he now laid\r\nhis stick with the looped string dangling from the center. The\r\ncontrivance when completed looked like a great figure H, from the\r\ncross-bar of which hung the loop just touching the top of the snow.\r\n\r\n“Now Weewah carefully opened the loop of the noose until it was\r\nlarge enough for the head of any lynx to pass through, and fastened\r\nit deftly with twigs and blades of dead grass, so as to hold it in\r\nplace firmly. From its front the thing looked like a miniature\r\ngallows--which, indeed, it was.\r\n\r\n“Next Weewah took the rabbit from his pouch, and creeping under the\r\nthicket carefully so as not to disturb his looped string, he placed\r\nthe still warm body an arm’s length behind the loop, propping the\r\nhead of the little animal up with twigs, to look as lifelike as\r\npossible. In an hour, at most, the rabbit would freeze and stiffen,\r\nand would then look exactly like a live rabbit crouching in the\r\nbushes.\r\n\r\n“Then the little Indian broke off branches, thrusting them into the\r\nsnow about the rabbit, until he had formed a little bower facing the\r\nsnare. Any animal attempting to seize it would thrust its own head\r\nright through the fatal hangman’s loop.\r\n\r\n“When Weewah had finished this task he gathered up his tomahawk and\r\nbow and arrows, and started back along his own trail. He made no\r\nattempt to cover up the traces of his work, as he would if trapping\r\na fox; for the lynx is a stupid creature, like all of his cousins of\r\nthe cat family, and will blunder into a trap of almost any kind.\r\n\r\n“The little Indian hurried along until he reached the point from\r\nwhich he had first crossed the lynx tracks. Here he turned sharply,\r\nstarting a great circle, which would be about a mile in diameter. He\r\ndid this to make sure that the lynx had not gone on farther than he\r\nthought. If he found no sign of fresh tracks he could feel certain\r\nthat the animal was still close at hand.\r\n\r\n“This took him several hours, and it was almost dark when he pulled\r\nback the flap and entered his home lodge in the village. He was\r\ntired, too, but his eyes shone with suppressed emotion.\r\n\r\n“As soon as he entered his mother set before him a smoking bowl of\r\nbroth without a word of comment or a question as to what his luck\r\nmight have been in his rabbit hunting. His father was there, gorging\r\nhimself on fat beaver meat that he had just brought in; but neither\r\nhe, nor Weewah’s brothers and sisters, offered any comment at the\r\nlittle boy’s entrance.\r\n\r\n“It is not correct etiquette, in Algonquin families, to ask the\r\nhunter what luck he has had until he has eaten. Even then a verbal\r\nquestion is not asked. But when the repast is finished the Indian\r\nwoman takes a pouch of the hunter and turns its contents out upon\r\nthe floor.\r\n\r\n“The emptiness of Weewah’s pouch spoke for itself, for he had flung\r\nit upon the floor on entering, where it lay flat. His father scowled\r\na little when he noticed it; for he wanted his son to be a credit to\r\nhim as a hunter. But his scowl turned into a merry twinkle when he\r\nsaw how radiant his son’s face was despite his ill luck, and what a\r\nsmall, delicately formed little fellow he was. Besides the old\r\nwarrior was in an unusually good humor. Had he not killed a fat\r\nbeaver that day? And was not beaver tail the choicest of all foods?\r\n\r\n“In a few hours Weewah’s brothers and sisters, rolled in their warm\r\nHudson Bay blankets, were breathing heavily, and his father and\r\nmother were far away in dreamland. Weewah was in dreamland, too; but\r\nnot the land that comes with sleep. He was in the happy state of\r\neager expectation that comes when to-morrow is to be a great day in\r\none’s life. And so he lay, snugly wrapped in his blanket, his black\r\neyes shining as he watched the embers of the fire in the center of\r\nthe tepee slowly grow dim and smoulder away. Meanwhile the very\r\nthing he was dreaming about was happening out in the dark spruce\r\nswamp.\r\n\r\n“The great lynx, whose tracks Weewah had seen, started out just at\r\ndusk on his nightly rabbit and grouse hunt. He had spent the day\r\ncurled up under the protecting boughs of a drooping spruce almost\r\nwithin sound of Weewah’s hatchet where the snare was being set. Now\r\nhe took his way leisurely along his former trail, sniffing the air,\r\nand examining every likely looking nook that might hide the material\r\nfor his supper. His great, fur-padded feet gave out no sound as he\r\nglided along over the now frozen crust, and he was the embodiment of\r\nstealth as he glided forward with ears erect, and stubby tail\r\nstraight out.\r\n\r\n“Suddenly he stopped, raised his head and distended his nostrils,\r\ndrinking in the familiar odor wafted to him from some point near at\r\nhand. Then he dropped low, his long fur dragging noiselessly on the\r\nsnow crust, as he wormed snake-like along toward a clump of\r\nlow-hanging spruces. His keen, yellow eyes had caught sight of the\r\ncrouching rabbit held in place at first by the twigs that Weewah had\r\nplaced there, but now stiff and rigid as iron.\r\n\r\n“Closer and closer crept the lynx, until he was within six feet of\r\nhis victim. And still the rabbit did not move. The great body,\r\nquivering with suppressed energy, now slowly lowered itself and the\r\nhind legs were carefully drawn under for the spring. Then like a\r\nflash the gray body shot forward and with a snarl the dagger-like\r\nteeth closed upon the bunch of fur.\r\n\r\n“At the same time the lynx felt a violent tug at his throat, and a\r\nheavy club dealt him a sharp blow across the back as it fell from\r\noverhead. In amazement the great brute dropped the rabbit, springing\r\nviolently backward as he did so. But the leather thong about his\r\nneck and the club attached to it followed him in the spring, the\r\nnoose tightening about his neck.\r\n\r\n“With a scream of rage he pulled violently to free himself, bracing\r\nwith his great fore feet against the club as he did so. But instead\r\nof freeing himself he felt a quick tightening of the noose at his\r\nthroat. Frantic with rage and fright he continued to jerk and pull,\r\nsometimes changing his attack to viciously biting the stick. But the\r\nonly effect produced was to gradually tighten the noose, which was\r\nnow tangled with the thick throat hair, and did not relax.\r\n\r\n“Time and again he returned furiously to the attack, bracing his\r\nfeet against the stick, and pulling with all his strength.\r\nInevitably he would have choked himself to death, as Weewah had\r\nplanned he should, but for the fact that the little Indian had made\r\nthe loop a little too long, so that the pulling produced a violent\r\nbut not fatal choking. Many a lynx commits suicide in this way just\r\nas the trapper plans it.\r\n\r\n“For hours the lynx wrestled vainly to free itself, varying the\r\nattacks on the club by trying to run away from it. But running away\r\nfrom it was quite as much out of the question as tearing it loose.\r\nFor when the animal attempted to run the club was jerked about its\r\nlimbs, tripping it, and frequently becoming entangled in brush and\r\nbushes. At last, exhausted, and thoroughly sulky, the great cat\r\nlaboriously climbed a tree, and extended itself along one of the\r\nlower limbs, the club still dangling at one side from its neck. In\r\nall its struggles it had not gone more than two hundred yards from\r\nwhere the trap had been set.\r\n\r\n“An hour before daylight the next morning, Weewah, who had been\r\nwaiting for the first indications of morning, stole silently out of\r\nthe tepee without awakening even the light-sleeping members of his\r\nfamily. He carried with him his own tomahawk, and his bow and arrow;\r\nbut also he carried the heavy axe that his mother used for cutting\r\nthe wood for the fire. She would miss it, he knew, and also he knew\r\nthat he would be in for a solid whack from the first stick that lay\r\nhandy when he returned; but he was willing to brave all this. The\r\naxe must be had at any cost.\r\n\r\n“The sun was just pushing its blood red rim above the low hills in\r\nthe east when he reached the edge of the spruce swamp. And it was\r\nstill only an oval, fire red ball when the little Indian approached\r\nthe place where he had set the snare the day before. He had swung\r\nalong lightly and swiftly over the beginning of the trail, but now\r\nas he approached the goal his heart beat hard against his chest,\r\njust as any white boy’s would have done under the circumstances. But\r\nlong before he actually reached the spot where the trap had been\r\nleft he knew that he had been successful. Successful, at least, in\r\nhaving lured the prey into his snare.\r\n\r\n“He could tell this by the condition of the snow, which had been dug\r\nup and thrown about by the wild struggle of the lynx. He loosened\r\nhis tomahawk, therefore, held his arrow in readiness on the string,\r\nand approached the scene of turmoil.\r\n\r\n“One glance at the trampled snow, the dead rabbit still lying where\r\nthe lynx had dropped it, and the broad twisting trail leading\r\nfurther into the swamp, told him the story of what had taken place\r\nmore completely than any white man could write it. And almost\r\nwithout pausing he began following this trail cautiously forward,\r\nhis arrow still poised; for one never knows what a captive animal\r\nmay do when driven to desperation.\r\n\r\n“Suddenly the little Indian stopped, his eyes snapping as he drew\r\nthe arrow to the head with every ounce of strength in his arms and\r\nback. There, crouching on an upper limb of a tree perhaps a foot in\r\ndiameter, was the huge lynx, watching him with curling lips,\r\ncrouching ready to spring.\r\n\r\n“Weewah’s first impulse was to send the finishing shaft through the\r\ngreat body on the limb. It would be a great triumph for Weewah--the\r\nlittle Indian boy, too small yet to be a hunter--to drag into his\r\nfather’s tepee early that morning a great forest cat killed with his\r\nown bow and arrow. But after all, would a really great hunter feel\r\nmuch pride in killing a captive lynx from a safe distance with an\r\narrow?\r\n\r\n“He knew very well that doing such a thing would not mark him as a\r\ngreat hunter. And he was determined that he should be called a great\r\nhunter before he was a day older.\r\n\r\n“So he lowered his arrow, removed it from the string, and laid the\r\nbow down beside the tree. He loosened his own tomahawk, also, and\r\nlaid that close at hand near the tree trunk. Then he seized the big\r\naxe of his mother that he had brought with him and began chopping at\r\nthe trunk, making the chips fly rapidly under his skillful aim.\r\n\r\n“At the first blow of the axe against the trunk the lynx had half\r\nrisen, giving a fierce growl of rage. For a moment it hesitated,\r\nready to spring on the boy. But that moment of hesitancy was\r\ndecisive. And as the strokes of the axe continued uninterruptedly\r\nthe great animal gradually settled down sulkily on the branch, cowed\r\nby its fruitless battle with the cord and stick.\r\n\r\n“Meanwhile Weewah was swinging his axe to good purpose. Nor was he\r\ndirecting his blows in a haphazard manner. With practiced eye he had\r\nselected a clear spot where he wished the tree to fall, and now by\r\ncutting half way through the trunk on the side facing in that\r\ndirection, and then cutting on exactly the opposite side a little\r\nhigher up he knew that the tree would fall precisely as he wished.\r\n\r\n“Presently the tree began to waver slightly. It was sufficient,\r\nhowever, to make the great cat on the bough crouch and whine with\r\nfright. A few more sharp blows of the axe made the top limbs tremble\r\nominously. A puff of wind now would have toppled it over; but there\r\nwas not a breath of air stirring. Another axe stroke or two and it\r\nwould bring it to the ground.\r\n\r\n“But before delivering the finishing strokes Weewah paused long\r\nenough to replace his snow-shoes which he had removed before he\r\nbegan chopping. He also picked up his tomahawk and thrust it half\r\nway into his belt, where he could seize it instantly. Then he took\r\nthe axe and gave three vigorous, carefully directed finishing blows.\r\n\r\n“And still the lynx did not leap. When the creature felt the limb\r\nquivering beneath it, it rose as if to jump; then, confused and\r\nuncertain, it crouched low again, clinging tightly to the branch as\r\nif for protection. Just before the limb reached the ground, however,\r\nit sprang far out into the snow, making violent leaps with the club\r\nwhirling about it, and quickly becoming entangled.\r\n\r\n“Weewah, with tomahawk raised, was close upon its heels. Another\r\nstride and he would have buried the blade in the animal’s skull. But\r\nat that moment the lynx wheeled suddenly, dodging the blow aimed at\r\nits head, and sprang toward its pursuer. Its great claws as it\r\nstruck at him cat fashion, scratched Weewah’s cheek, and cut two\r\ndeep grooves in his shoulder. It was a blow that would have been\r\ndisastrous had not the entangled club jerked the animal to one side.\r\n\r\n“With a yell the little Indian sprang toward the crouching, snarling\r\nanimal, thrusting out his right snow-shoe as he did so. Instantly\r\nthe frame and lacings of the shoe were crushed in the savage jaws of\r\nthe lynx. But at the same moment the tomahawk blade flashed through\r\nthe air and buried itself deep in the thick skull.\r\n\r\n“Without a sound the great fur-covered body relaxed, quivered, and\r\nthen lay still with the teeth still buried in the snow-shoe frame\r\nonly an inch from Weewah’s foot.\r\n\r\n“The little Indian stood for a few moments looking at his victim.\r\nThen he reached down and tried to pry loose the fixed jaws. It was\r\nno easy task. For the muscles had set in the last convulsive death\r\ngrip and it was only with the aid of his tomahawk blade that they\r\ncould finally be relaxed.\r\n\r\n“Weewah now lashed the forepaws to the dead animal’s lower jaw to\r\nprevent them from catching against things as he dragged the body\r\nover the snow. Then he unfastened the strap from the club, and\r\ntaking the line over his shoulder started for home, scuffing along\r\nas best he could on his broken snow-shoe, towing the big cat after\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“All that morning Weewah’s mother had scolded about the missing axe.\r\nWeewah was missing too, but she felt no solicitude about that. With\r\nthe axe it was different: people who took away axes were not always\r\nparticular about returning them, whereas boys always came back. It\r\nhadn’t occurred to her that the boy and the axe had gone away\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n“She had grumblingly gathered wood for the fire without the aid of\r\nher usual implement, and now was busily engaged in boiling roots and\r\nmeat in a great pot, while her husband smoked his pipe, paying no\r\nattention to his spouse’s complaints. Some of the smaller children\r\nwere playing noisy games, running in and out of the tepee, shouting\r\nand laughing like a pack of white school children.\r\n\r\n“Presently one of Weewah’s younger sisters, squatted on a stump,\r\nraised a shrill cry, ‘Weewah, Weewah is coming!’\r\n\r\n“The playing stopped at once, the children gathering in front of the\r\ntepee to gaze in mute astonishment at their older brother. Tired as\r\nhe was from dragging the load, and leg weary from stumbling along\r\nwith his broken snow-shoe, he now held his head erect and his chin\r\nhigh. Without a word he strode into the open flap of the tepee,\r\ndragging the dead lynx after him. In front of his father he stopped\r\nand dropped his burden; then he drew the blood-stained tomahawk from\r\nhis belt and laid it beside the dead animal, and stood silently\r\nbefore his parent with folded arms.\r\n\r\n“For several minutes the warrior smoked his pipe in silence. Then he\r\ngave a grunt of satisfaction, laid his pipe aside, and ran his hand\r\ndeliberately over the body of the dead animal. He found no arrow\r\nholes. Next he turned the great head and examined the clean wound,\r\nand then the blood-stained blade of the tomahawk, and the tightened\r\ncord of buckskin about the neck.\r\n\r\n“His examination told him the story of what had happened out there\r\nin the woods. He knew that Weewah had first caught the lynx in his\r\nsnare, and then had killed it with a blow from his tomahawk instead\r\nof shooting it with an arrow. And he was proud of his son. But no\r\none but an Indian would have known it.\r\n\r\n“With another grunt of satisfaction, however, he drew his hunting\r\nknife from the sheath in his belt. By a few deft strokes he severed\r\ntwo toes from the forepaw of the lynx, with the long curved claws\r\nprotruding, leaving a strip of fur at the back. Then he quickly\r\nfashioned a loop in the skin so that the claws hung as a pendant\r\nfrom it. When this was finished to his satisfaction he stood up and\r\nbeckoned to the boy; and when Weewah stepped forward the old Indian\r\nplaced the fur string about his neck with the lynx claws suspended\r\nin front.\r\n\r\n“Then he placed his hands on the little fellow’s shoulders and\r\nlooked sharply into his eyes, the little Indian returning the gaze\r\nwith quiet dignity.\r\n\r\n“‘Weewah, the mighty hunter,’ the old Indian said slowly.\r\n\r\n“Then he seated himself and resumed his pipe as if nothing had\r\nhappened.”\r\n\r\nMartin knocked the ashes out of his pipe and threw an extra chunk of\r\nwood on the fire.\r\n\r\n“Time we were turning in,” he said.\r\n\r\n“But tell me,” Larry asked; “did Weewah’s mother give him the\r\nbeating for taking her axe?”\r\n\r\n“What, beat a mighty hunter like Weewah?” Martin asked in feigned\r\nsurprise. “No indeed! No more beatings for him. From that day on no\r\nwoman, not even his mother, would ever give him a blow. And his\r\nfather would now take him with him on his hunting trips, even into\r\nthe most dangerous places, just as he would any other hunter. For he\r\nhad proved his title, you see.”\r\n\r\nThen the old man took his pipe from his lips, and said to the boy\r\nearnestly:\r\n\r\n“You see I am the old Indian and you are Weewah in this case. Only\r\nyou haven’t had a chance to kill your lynx yet. But we are going\r\nright into that country where the lynx lives, and sooner or later\r\nyou’ll have a chance to show your metal. When that time comes\r\nremember the story of little Weewah.\r\n\r\n“And now you must turn in for the night.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n                         FINAL PREPARATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nSometime in the middle of the night Larry was awakened by flakes of\r\nsnow driven into his face, and by the sound of the storm howling\r\naround the tent. The flakes sputtered in the fire which still flared\r\nand struggled to keep burning. The boy was warm and comfortable in\r\nthe fur bag, however, and after pulling the flap over his head to\r\nkeep out the snow, he was soon sleeping soundly. When he opened his\r\neyes again it was daylight, and Martin was plodding about in the\r\nstorm, building a fire close to the tent where the wind struck it\r\nleast. The snow was still falling and was even then a foot deep on\r\nthe level.\r\n\r\nThe old hunter was in high spirits: he had been hoping for the\r\nstorm, and the fact that it was a roaring blizzard made no\r\ndifference to him so long as the snow kept falling.\r\n\r\nThe inside of the tent was warm and the boy crawled out of the fur\r\nbag reluctantly and reached for his shoes.\r\n\r\n“Not that pair,” old Martin said; “there are your things over at the\r\nfoot of your bed. No more city clothes from now on. I nearly worked\r\nmy fingers off last night getting things ready for you.”\r\n\r\nLarry wondered how much time the old hunter had found for sleep when\r\nhe examined the pile of clothing the hunter had laid out for him.\r\nFor most of the pieces had been altered in some way to make them so\r\nthat the boy could wear them, cut down from some of the larger\r\ngarments from the hunting outfit. Sleeves and trouser-legs had been\r\ncut off or turned up, and buttons set over to take up the slack of\r\nthe bagging jacket in a way that showed how handy the old hunter was\r\nwith the needle. His most laborious task had been in reducing the\r\nsize of a pair of moose-skin moccasins, although he had simplified\r\nthis operation by taking in the back seam. At that they were at\r\nleast three sizes too large, as Larry pointed out.\r\n\r\n“But when you have on two, or three, or four pairs of thick German\r\nsocks,” Martin assured him, “you won’t notice a little thing like\r\nthat. And you’ll fill out the rest of the clothes with underwear the\r\nsame way.”\r\n\r\nBeside the pile of clothing Martin had placed some other things\r\nwhich he told the boy were to be his personal belongings that were\r\nto be carried with him all the time except when he slept. But the\r\nhunter told him not to put them away until after they had had\r\nbreakfast, and made things a little more secure about the tent. So\r\nLarry left the things as he found them, and went to help Martin.\r\n\r\nHe soon discovered the difference between his new clothes and the\r\n“city” ones he had discarded. Even the fury of the blizzard could\r\nnot force the piercing cold through the thick, soft Mackinaw cloth;\r\nand with the exception of the end of his nose, he was as warm as\r\ntoast as he worked under the hunter’s directions.\r\n\r\nOne side and the back of their tent was protected from the wind by\r\nthe wall of rock, and the fire checked the fury of the storm from\r\nthe front; but the snow drifted in on them from the unprotected\r\nside, and they remedied this by stretching a piece of canvas across\r\nthe gap. It was no easy task, and several times the wind tore it\r\naway before they could get it anchored securely, but when it was\r\nfinally made storm proof the enclosure before the roaring fire was\r\nalmost as warm and comfortable as a house.\r\n\r\n“Now for your equipment,” Martin announced, when everything was\r\nsecured to his complete satisfaction.\r\n\r\nLarry found that a light hunting hatchet and a stout hunting knife\r\nhad been added to his belt of cartridges, suspended in leather\r\nsheaths from loops slipped over the belt. The belt itself was passed\r\nthrough the loops in the jacket, so that the weight came upon his\r\nshoulders instead of his waist, and when buckled, drew the coat\r\nsnugly around him. The gun in its sheath was slung over his shoulder\r\nand hung at his left side. His fur mittens were fastened with\r\nleather strings to the coat sleeves so that there was no possibility\r\nof losing them even when slipped off.\r\n\r\nThere was a pocket compass in a hunting case about the size of a\r\nwatch which fitted into an upper pocket of his jacket which had a\r\nbutton flap for holding it. As an additional precaution against\r\nlosing it a leather string reached from the inside of the pocket and\r\nwas fastened to the ring. And Larry found that his watch was secured\r\nin his watch-pocket in a similar manner.\r\n\r\n“We can’t take a chance on losing anything,” the hunter explained;\r\n“for there are no jewelry stores along the road that we are going to\r\ntravel.”\r\n\r\nLarry found that there were three water-proof match boxes to be\r\ndistributed in his trousers’ pockets, and a pocket knife that\r\ncombined several kinds of useful tools. The matches seemed to be the\r\nordinary parlor kind. But Martin surprised him by taking one,\r\ndipping it in a cup of water, and then after wiping it off, lighting\r\nit like an ordinary dry match. Even after a match had been floating\r\nin the water for several minutes it would light and burn readily.\r\n\r\n“They’ve all been dipped in shellac,” Martin explained. “The shellac\r\nforms a water-proof coating that keeps out moisture but doesn’t\r\ninterfere with lighting or burning. So even if your match safe leaks\r\nyou won’t have to go without a fire.”\r\n\r\nIn one box which Larry thought contained matches he found six little\r\ncubes looking like wax run into little square aluminum cups. Martin\r\nexplained their use by a simple demonstration. He placed one of them\r\non the ground where he had scraped away the snow, laid a handful of\r\nsticks over it, struck a match and touched the wax-like substance.\r\nIt burst into a bright flame at once, and continued to burn fiercely\r\nfor several minutes, igniting the sticks about it and helping to\r\nkeep their struggling flames going until enough heat had been\r\ngenerated to make a steady fire.\r\n\r\n“That’s a new fangled thing called ‘solid alcohol,’ used to start a\r\ntenderfoot’s fire when he is wet and cold and has no little dry\r\ntwigs at hand,” said Martin. “An old woodsmen like me ought to throw\r\nthe stuff away and scorn to use it; and forty years ago I would have\r\ndone so. But I am wiser now, I hope, and I don’t despise some of the\r\nnew things as I did then. And I remember two different occasions\r\nwhen I came near losing my life in the snow because my hands were so\r\ncold and numb, and the small wood was so scarce, that I came near\r\nnot getting my fire started at all. So now I am going to take along\r\na few packages of these cubes, and you must do the same. We’ll never\r\nuse it except as a last resort; but sometime it may come in handy\r\nfor starting a fire or boiling a cup of tea.\r\n\r\n“You know we will only use two matches a day after we leave here--one\r\nmatch to start our fire at noon and at night. There will be coals\r\nfrom the night next morning to cook our breakfast by. It’s a mark of\r\nbad woodsmanship to have to use more than one match to start a fire,\r\nno matter what kind of weather is going.”\r\n\r\n“But how about your pipe?” Larry asked. For the old man smoked\r\nalmost continually during his waking hours.\r\n\r\nOld Martin sighed and shook his head. “No more pipe for me after we\r\nleave here,” he said, with a little laugh. “The weight in pemmican\r\nthat I’ll take instead of the tobacco may be just the amount that\r\nwill decide the question of our getting through alive. Smoking isn’t\r\na necessity, but eating is.”\r\n\r\nLarry looked at the old man to see if he were not joking; but he saw\r\nthat he was thoroughly in earnest. It made the boy realize the\r\nserious nature of the task before them to know that the old man was\r\ngoing to sacrifice the greatest solace of his life. But it roused\r\nhis determination, and his spirits were too buoyant to be long\r\ndepressed.\r\n\r\nAll day long Martin kept him busy helping at various things that\r\nmust be completed before their departure. The toboggans were hauled\r\ninto the canvas enclosure, where he and the old man packed and\r\nunpacked the loads, adding something here, or leaving out something\r\nthere, working in the glow of the warm fire. Dog harnesses had to be\r\naltered and extra ones tucked away on the sleds, snow-shoe lacings\r\nexamined and re-lashed, and a dozen things attended to that Larry\r\nrecognized as important when Martin pointed them out. The fire, too,\r\nneeded considerable tending to keep a huge kettle of beans cooking\r\nwhich Martin declared must simmer all day if they were to be cooked\r\nproperly.\r\n\r\nToward night the wind subsided, and the clouds cleared away, so that\r\nby the time they had finished their heaping plates of pork and beans\r\nthe stars were out glistening like steel points in the frosty air.\r\nLater in the evening they heard howling in the distance--terrifying\r\nsounds to the boy, made by a pack of big timber wolves out on a\r\nhunt, as Martin explained. And for fear the dogs might start an\r\nindependent wolf hunt on their own account, Martin tied up the big\r\nmalamoots after he had fed them.\r\n\r\nDuring the day Martin had brought several armfuls of packages into\r\nthe tent from the stores under the tarpaulin as he went back and\r\nforth at his work. Now that supper was over and the dishes cleaned\r\nhe lighted his pipe and and seated himself beside the packages. He\r\nwas always talkative when working by the evening fire, and seemed to\r\nfind great pleasure in imparting bits of information to the boy from\r\nhis inexhaustible store of woodland experiences.\r\n\r\nTo-night as he began fumbling among the packages, he asked:\r\n\r\n“Larry, have you decided what you are going to carry in your ditty\r\nbag?”\r\n\r\n“Ditty bag?” Larry repeated; “I’d know better what I was going to\r\ncarry in it if I knew what a ‘ditty bag’ was.”\r\n\r\n“What, a veteran forest pilot like you not know what a ditty bag\r\nis!” Martin asked in mock astonishment. “Then it’s high time for you\r\nto learn. A ditty bag is the thing that does for the woodsman what\r\nall the pockets in a suit of clothes do for a boy--it carries the\r\nforty and one indispensable things that can’t be carried in some\r\nother place. You’d better sit over here beside me and make yours up\r\nto-night while I am fitting out mine.”\r\n\r\nSo the boy moved over to the little pile of packages ready for\r\ninstructions.\r\n\r\nThe hunter handed him a little bag made of tough water-proof\r\nmaterial with a string at the top for tying securely. Then he\r\nrummaged through the packages, taking out what he wanted and placing\r\nthem in the bag. At his suggestion Larry duplicated this selection\r\nof things for his own bag, so that in case one bag should be lost\r\nthey would still have the other. “But,” said Martin, “you must put\r\nin some little thing for luck--anything that strikes your fancy,\r\nafter the other things are in. That’s a hunter’s superstition, like\r\nthe Indian’s ‘medicine.’”\r\n\r\nThe first useful article selected was a neat Red Cross package\r\ncontaining a few useful medicines and surgical dressings for an\r\nemergency. Next came needles of all sizes, with several skeins of\r\nthread, and a wooden handle in which were several awls, neatly\r\nstored in a hollow bobbin on which was wound many lengths of strong\r\nwaxed cord. A can of gunoil found a place, and a small whetstone,\r\nrough on one side for sharpening the axes, and smooth on the other\r\nfor the knives. A tool case, containing a “good-sized carpenter\r\nshop,” as Martin explained and made of aluminum after Mr. Ware’s own\r\ndesign, found especial favor; and a broken shell extractor was\r\nconsidered indispensable.\r\n\r\nButtons and skeins of twine of various sizes went into the bag as a\r\nmatter of course; but when the old hunter selected three packages,\r\neach containing a dozen yards of the kind of twisted wire used for\r\nhanging pictures of different sizes, the boy burst out laughing and\r\nrolled on the blankets. He suspected Martin of trying to play off a\r\nquiet hoax on him, and did not intend to be caught in the trap.\r\n\r\nNothing was farther from Martin’s thoughts, however, as Larry\r\ndiscovered when the use of the wire was explained. It was to be used\r\nfor making the snares for catching small animals, particularly\r\nrabbits, the hunter said, and for that purpose was unequaled. And\r\nthe old man assured him that for securing food on the march in a\r\nsnow-bound country snares were far more useful than rifles. Indian\r\nfamilies in many northern regions depended almost entirely upon\r\ntheir snares for their supply of winter food.\r\n\r\n“Rabbits are the bread and butter of the woodsman in the winter,”\r\nMartin said. “The rabbits make little narrow paths in the\r\nsnow--thousands of them, running in all directions--and when they are\r\nnot disturbed and going about their business, they always follow\r\nthese paths. Now when the rabbit comes to a fallen limb lying across\r\nhis path a few inches above the ground, he likes to go under the\r\nlimb rather than hop over it. This simplifies matters for the\r\nIndian. He simply hangs his snare in front of the hole under the\r\nlimb, and is almost sure to catch the first rabbit that comes\r\nhopping along that particular path.\r\n\r\n“The snare is just a simple slip-noose made large enough to let the\r\nrabbit’s head pass through easily. If the wind is blowing the snare\r\ncan be held open and in place by tying it with blades of dead grass,\r\nwhich are strong enough to hold it in place until the rabbit gets\r\nhis head through.\r\n\r\n“The other end of the snare string is tied to a limb that is bent\r\ndown and fastened in a notch cut in a stick or a small sapling if it\r\nhappens to be in the right place. The notch is cut deep enough to\r\nhold the bent limb, but not firmly enough but what it can be jerked\r\nloose pretty easily.\r\n\r\n“Now when the rabbit comes hopping along the path and starts to go\r\nunder the limb, he runs his head through the snare. When he feels\r\nsomething around his neck he pulls back to get out of its way; but\r\nthat tightens the noose about his neck, and he begins leaping about\r\nfrantically to get loose. In this way he jerks the bent limb out of\r\nthe notch that holds it down, the limb flies back, and swings him up\r\ninto the air where he smothers in short order.\r\n\r\n“Of course if the snare was simply fastened to the limb over the\r\npath the rabbit would choke himself to death for a certainty,\r\nbecause he never stops pulling and tugging at the noose while he has\r\na kick left in him. But then some fox or weasel would probably come\r\nalong and get him. But neither of them will get him if he is\r\ndangling in the air: the weasel can’t reach him, and the fox is such\r\na crafty fellow, always looking out for traps and tricks, that he\r\nwon’t go near a dead rabbit hanging on a string, even if he is\r\nstarving.\r\n\r\n“Now that the snow has stopped falling the rabbits will be out\r\nto-night making paths, and to-morrow night we’ll put out some snares\r\njust for practice. I’ll teach you a dozen ways to make snares for\r\ndifferent kinds of game, but the principle of all of them is the\r\nsame as the one for catching Mr. Rabbit. And he’s the boy we’re\r\ninterested in mostly.”\r\n\r\nThe old hunter rose and went out to “have a look at the snow,” as he\r\nput it. He came back well pleased with his inspection.\r\n\r\n“The crust will form and set hard to-night,” he said to Larry, “and\r\nto-morrow you’ll begin your hardest and most important\r\nlesson--learning to walk on snow-shoes. You can look forward to\r\ntaking some of the grandest headers you have ever taken in your\r\nlife,” he added, grinning.\r\n\r\n“But--” Larry began, and then stopped.\r\n\r\n“‘But’ what?” Martin asked.\r\n\r\n“Oh, nothing,” Larry answered evasively. “I was just thinking of\r\nthose headers that I am going to take to-morrow, that’s all.”\r\n\r\n“Well, go to bed and dream about them then,” the old hunter\r\ninstructed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n                   THE JOURNEY THROUGH THE FOREST\r\n\r\n\r\n“My goodness, boy,” the old hunter said the next morning at\r\nbreakfast, “I do wish you could handle a pair of snow-shoes. We’d\r\nstart for home to-morrow, if you could. For the crust is perfect,\r\nand the weather is settled for a spell I think. But there’s no use\r\nstarting until we can make good time every hour, so we’ll spend\r\nanother week letting you learn to use the snow-shoes, and getting\r\nthe kinks out of your legs.”\r\n\r\nLarry made no reply but munched his bacon and biscuit, occasionally\r\nhanding a bit to Kim who sat near, watching expectantly. As soon as\r\nbreakfast was finished, Martin brought our two pairs of snow-shoes\r\nand strapped one pair to his own feet, instructing Larry to follow\r\nhis example. Then he showed the boy how to take the swinging,\r\ngliding steps, sliding one shoe past the other with the peculiar leg\r\nmotion that shot the shoe ahead without getting tangled up with its\r\nmate.\r\n\r\n“Now watch me while I run out to that tree and back, and try to do\r\nas I do when you start,” he instructed. And with that he struck out,\r\nthe two dogs running beside him, barking excitedly, for they seemed\r\nto know the significance of snow-shoes, and were eager for a run\r\nthrough the woods.\r\n\r\nThe tree Martin had indicated was about a hundred yards away, and\r\nthe old hunter covered the distance at top speed, exhilarated as a\r\nboy trying his skates on the first ice of the winter. He did not\r\nstop when the tree was reached, but turned sharply to one side so as\r\nto circle it. As he did so Larry passed the tree on the other side,\r\nrunning like a veteran, trying to beat him, and bursting with\r\nsuppressed laughter. “I’ll race you to the top of the hill and\r\nback,” the boy shouted exultantly.\r\n\r\nBut the old man, in his astonishment, bumped into a sapling and came\r\nto a full stop.\r\n\r\n“Where in the world did you learn to use snow-shoes like that?” he\r\nasked, when Larry had swung around to him.\r\n\r\n“Oh, in the Adirondacks that winter,” Larry answered, trying to seem\r\nas if knowing how to use snow-shoes was the most ordinary thing in\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\n“But why didn’t you _say_ so?” Martin persisted, his face beaming.\r\n\r\n“Well, you never asked me,” said Larry. “I came within one of\r\ntelling you last night, but I just thought I’d save it and surprise\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“Well, you sure did surprise me,” the old hunter said; “the very\r\nbest surprise I have had since I can remember. Why, I woke up half a\r\ndozen times last night worrying because we would have to wait so\r\nlong because you had to learn to use the shoes before we could\r\nstart. And here you knew how all the time. You can run like an\r\nIndian, Larry.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I can run pretty good,” Larry admitted modestly. “I beat all\r\nthe boys in the Christmas races up there last year, and one of them\r\nwas an Indian boy, at that.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll bet you did,” Martin exclaimed with admiration. “Why, I was\r\ngoing at a pretty good clip myself just now, and yet you were at my\r\nheels. Face about and back to the tent we go, for now we have a new\r\nday’s work before us, and to-morrow we head for home.”\r\n\r\nSaying this Martin turned and ran for the camp, Larry doing his best\r\nto keep up; but he finished twenty feet behind. It is one thing to\r\nbeat a crowd of boys on snow-shoes, but quite another to have a\r\ncompetitor who could show his heels to every man in the whole North\r\nCountry.\r\n\r\nAnd now everything was arranged exactly as if they were making their\r\nstart in earnest. The sledges were loaded with infinite care, and\r\nthe dogs harnessed in their places, one dog to each toboggan. Larry\r\nwas to have Kim under his charge, and to pull in harness with the\r\ndog; for Kim was not only the stronger dog of the two, but also the\r\none most easily managed.\r\n\r\nMartin had made harnesses for himself and Larry, with broad draw\r\nstraps over the shoulders and across the chest, so that the weight\r\nof the body was thrown into the harness as they bent forward in\r\nwalking. The old hunter harnessed himself in front of his dog, so as\r\nto choose the course, set the pace, and break the trail all at the\r\nsame time. But he instructed Larry to harness himself next his\r\ntoboggan and behind Kim.\r\n\r\nBy this arrangement the old man worked out a shrewdly conceived\r\nplan. He knew that Kim would always strive to keep up with the sled\r\njust ahead of him, for that is the nature of the malamoot when\r\nsledging. This would force the boy to keep up the pace, no matter\r\nhow tired and leg weary he might be. At the same time it gave Larry\r\nthe benefit of a thoroughly broken-out trail every step of the way--a\r\nthing the boy learned to appreciate within an hour.\r\n\r\nBefore starting Martin built up a rousing fire to keep the camp\r\nkettle boiling, and then with a shout struck out into the forest. At\r\nfirst he went almost in a straight course, and at a pace that made\r\nLarry open his eyes in amazement. Was _this_ the speed they would\r\nhave to keep up hour after hour? Then the old man made wide circles,\r\nbending first one way and then the other, until they had been going\r\nabout an hour and a half. Now he stopped and asked the panting,\r\nperspiring Larry, how he would take a short-cut to camp.\r\n\r\n“Good gracious, I don’t know!” said the boy.\r\n\r\n“Well, I didn’t expect you would,” Martin said quietly; “but I’m\r\ngoing to let you steer us back to it all the same. Take your compass\r\nand lead us straight northeast and you’ll land us there. It will be\r\ngood practice for you. And mind you, keep up the pace.”\r\n\r\nLarry now changed places with Kim, taking the lead as Martin had\r\ndone, got out his compass, and they were off again. The country was\r\nfairly open, so that while he was guided by the little instrument,\r\nhe really steered by landmarks, as Martin had instructed him.\r\nUsually the landmark was some tree some distance away that stood\r\nexactly in line with the northeast mark indicated by the compass.\r\nThis tree would then be the boy’s goal until he reached it, when\r\nsome other mark further on would be selected. In this way the\r\ninstrument was only brought into use every half mile or so, a much\r\neasier method than constantly watching the dial.\r\n\r\nThe old hunter offered no suggestions about the route, he and Jack\r\nsimply plodding along in the procession. But Larry, upon whom the\r\nbrunt of everything had now fallen, had hard work to keep his\r\nflagging legs moving along at a rate that would satisfy the members\r\nof his rear guard. He was surprised that they did not come across\r\nsome marks of the trail they had made on the way out even after they\r\nhad been plodding for a full three-quarters of an hour. This made\r\nhim apprehensive that Martin was letting him take them out of their\r\ncourse, for some reason of his own. He was astonished, therefore,\r\nsuddenly to come in sight of their camp dead ahead, and not over a\r\nquarter of a mile away. The compass had given him a short-cut from\r\nMartin’s purposely bending course.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the dogs sighted the camp they began barking wildly and\r\ntugging at the traces in their eagerness to reach it; and Larry,\r\nwhose legs were flagging sadly, felt all weariness disappear in the\r\nexcitement of finishing the run. So, shouting and laughing, with\r\nboth dogs leaping and barking, the two teams raced into camp neck\r\nand neck.\r\n\r\nThey rested a few minutes, and then began making final preparations\r\nfor an early start the next day. They visited the yacht and found\r\nthat she was packed thick in a huge bank of ice that had formed upon\r\nher, and been banked about her by the waves, so that she was\r\npractically frozen in for the winter. Then they strengthened all the\r\nfastenings of the canvas under which the provisions and supplies\r\nwere stored, and Martin cut several strips of canvas and tied them\r\nwith short pieces of rope to trees a few feet away and all about the\r\nheap, where they would blow about in the wind and frighten any\r\ninquisitive prowlers, particularly foxes.\r\n\r\n“But what is the use of going to all that trouble, Martin?” Larry\r\nasked. “We will never come back to this place, and probably no one\r\nelse will come here, so all this work is for nothing it seems to\r\nme.”\r\n\r\nThe old hunter smiled and shook his head. “That’s the way I should\r\nhave talked at your age,” he said. “But I have learned that many\r\nthings in this world turn out very differently from what we expect,\r\nand so I always plan for the very worst that can possibly happen.\r\nAnd it will be a comfort for me to know that there is a big cache of\r\nsupplies waiting here in case we have to come back, although I\r\nhaven’t the faintest idea of doing so.”\r\n\r\nWhen the canvasses had been secured to Martin’s satisfaction he made\r\nthe fastenings all about their camp secure in the same way. For he\r\nhad decided not to take their present tent with them, but in its\r\nplace a smaller one, made with a stout canvas bottom sewed fast to\r\nthe rest of the tent, so that the whole thing resembled a huge bag.\r\nThere were several advantages in this arrangement. It provided a\r\ndry, clean floor, kept the wind from creeping in, and obviated the\r\nlikelihood of losing small articles at the camp site that might\r\notherwise be overlooked and left behind on breaking camp. Moreover,\r\nit insured the tent not being blown from over their heads in a gale\r\nshould the fastenings give way--a very important thing when passing\r\nthrough a barren, windswept country.\r\n\r\nThen they made a final inspection of the toboggan loads, unpacking\r\nthem and re-packing them carefully, Martin enjoining the boy to\r\nmemorize every article and where it could be found on each sledge.\r\nThis would save them much useless hunting, and overhauling, and\r\ndisarranging of the loads. And so when night came they were all\r\nready for the early start the next morning.\r\n\r\nAt daylight they were off on their race for life--just how grim and\r\nserious an undertaking Larry was to learn before the day was over.\r\nFor now it was plod, plod, plod, Martin setting the pace and\r\nbreaking the trail, keeping up an even swing forward regardless of\r\nobstacles. Long before midday Larry realized the magnitude of their\r\nundertaking; for Martin allowed no pause, no resting to catch up\r\nlost breath. It was on, and on, every step ahead being counted\r\nprecious gain through the unknown stretch of wilderness.\r\n\r\nAt noon they stopped, the dogs dropping in their tracks, and Larry\r\nstretched his aching legs on his load while Martin boiled a pot of\r\ntea and heated up their lunch. But in half an hour they were back in\r\nthe harness again, trudging on silently. Even the dogs seemed to\r\nrealize that they must do their utmost, straining at the traces all\r\nthe time, with noses pointed straight ahead, but wasting no energy\r\nin useless looking about at interesting objects along the trail as\r\nthey had always done on their previous journeys.\r\n\r\nBy the middle of the afternoon even the dogs showed signs of\r\nfatigue, as the loads were heavy, and despite every effort he could\r\nmake, Martin’s speed was gradually slackening. By this time Kim was\r\nobliged to haul his load practically without aid from Larry, whose\r\nlegs were tottering. Yet the boy pushed his feet ahead mechanically,\r\nwatching the slowly descending sun, and hoping the old hunter would\r\nsoon decide to stop for the night. But it was not until just before\r\nsunset that the old man halted and selected a place for their camp.\r\n\r\nHis first provision for the night was to help Larry set up the tent;\r\nthen he took his snares and went off into the woods to set them,\r\ninstructing Larry to get in a good supply of wood and a big heap of\r\nboughs for their bed. “We can cook and eat after dark, you know,” he\r\nsaid, “but these other things have to be done in daylight.”\r\n\r\nFortunately for the boy boughs and wood were close at hand, for he\r\nwas fagged and exhausted beyond expression. He knew what Martin had\r\nsaid to him about “getting accustomed to it in a few days” was\r\nprobably true, and this helped him keep up his courage; but there is\r\na limit to muscular endurance even when backed by the highest\r\nquality of will-power. He managed to collect the wood and the\r\nboughs, however, by the time Martin returned, and the old man found\r\nhim lying on the heap of boughs, sleeping the sleep of complete\r\nexhaustion.\r\n\r\nThe six days following were practically repetitions of the first--a\r\nceaseless grind of hard work through the timber. Martin, although a\r\ntough and seasoned veteran, began to show the effects of the strain,\r\nwhile Larry had become an automaton, who performed the three\r\nfunctions of working, eating, and sleeping mechanically. There were\r\nno talks beside the camp-fire now before turning in, neither man nor\r\nboy having enough surplus energy left at the end of the day to\r\nindulge in more conversation than was absolutely necessary. Both had\r\nsettled down to their grim work, more and more of which Martin had\r\ntaken upon himself as they proceeded; and every day the boy had\r\nreason to be thankful to the tough old woodsman for little acts of\r\nkindness and thoughtfulness. But his efforts left the old man too\r\ntired for useless conversation even if Larry had cared to listen.\r\n\r\nAt noon on the seventh day the woods thinned out into scraggly\r\ntrees, and an hour later the travelers emerged upon a flat, and\r\napparently treeless plain. Here Martin called a halt and left Larry\r\nand the dogs while he took observations. In a few minutes he\r\nreturned, but instead of fastening on his harness he sat down beside\r\nLarry on the sled.\r\n\r\n“It isn’t as bad as it might be,” he said, “but it is bad enough, at\r\nthat. I can make out the outline of the fringe of trees on the other\r\nside from the top of a big rock over yonder, and I think it is only\r\nten miles over to them. But I’m not sure, for distances are\r\ndeceptive in this country. So we’ll camp here now and get an early\r\nstart in the morning.”\r\n\r\nThen he added, with a grim smile, “I guess you won’t mind the six\r\nhours’ extra rest.”\r\n\r\nThey made their camp accordingly in a clump of trees, and Larry and\r\nthe dogs slept and rested, while the old hunter arranged for the\r\nnext day’s run. This consisted in rearranging the loads, examining\r\nand mending harnesses and sled lashings, besides performing Larry’s\r\nusual task of gathering wood and boughs, not rousing the tired boy\r\nuntil a hot supper was ready. And when Larry had gorged himself,\r\nMartin sent him back to his sleeping bag to get more rest without\r\nwaiting to help about cleaning up the supper pans and pots.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n                            THE BLIZZARD\r\n\r\n\r\nEven after the dogs were harnessed and ready to start the following\r\nmorning Martin hesitated.\r\n\r\n“There’s a storm brewing,” he said. “The moon and the stars showed\r\nit last night, and I can feel it in the air this morning. But we may\r\nbe able to get across before it strikes us, and I suppose we’ve got\r\nto chance it.”\r\n\r\nTo Larry the old hunter’s apprehensions seemed absurd. The sun was\r\nglaring brightly over the tree tops, and across the glistening crust\r\nof the open plain the trees on the other side could be seen as a low\r\ngray line, apparently close at hand. Surely those trees would be\r\nreached before any storm settled over this clear day.\r\n\r\nThe hauling was much easier, too, on the smooth, level crust, so\r\ndifferent from the rough woodlands. Indeed, Larry’s toboggan seemed\r\nto move so lightly that the boy stopped and examined his load after\r\nhe had been traveling a few minutes. He found, to his surprise, that\r\nfully half his load had been transferred to Martin’s toboggan. The\r\ndiscovery made his heart go out anew to the old man now rushing\r\nahead in feverish haste over the crust, and he put every ounce of\r\nstrength into keeping up the pace.\r\n\r\nAt the end of two hours the gray line ahead had become broad and\r\nwell-defined, while the line of trees behind them had dwindled to a\r\nlow gray streak on the horizon. But meanwhile the sun had turned to\r\na dull red ball and the wind had shifted into their faces. It took\r\nno practiced eye now to see that a storm was approaching. But no one\r\nunfamiliar with an arctic blizzard could conceive the fury of such a\r\nstorm as the one that broke half an hour later.\r\n\r\nSquarely in their faces the wind struck them with such force that\r\neven the dogs turned instinctively to avoid it, and to shield\r\nthemselves from the cutting, sand-like snow that was driven before\r\nit. The temperature, too, dropped with inconceivable rapidity, and\r\nthe cold penetrated Larry’s thick clothing so that his skin tingled\r\ndespite the fact that he was exerting himself to the utmost, and a\r\nmoment before had been hot from his efforts. He closed his eyes for\r\na moment to shield them, and instantly the lashes were frozen\r\ntogether. Unable to proceed he turned his back to the blast to rub\r\nthem open, and when he succeeded in doing so he found that Martin’s\r\nsledge was completely blotted out by the storm, so that he was not\r\nsure even of its location.\r\n\r\nIn a panic he realized the seriousness of his situation and rushed\r\nforward in a frenzied effort to overtake his leader, shouting as he\r\nstruggled with the load. But his voice scarcely carried to the\r\nstruggling Kim, being drowned in the howl of the storm. He still had\r\nenough command of his senses to remember that the wind was blowing\r\nfrom dead ahead. But now, for some reason he did not understand, Kim\r\nrefused to face the blast squarely, but persisted obstinately in\r\nturning almost at right angles to the left. In vain Larry shouted,\r\nand kicked at the dog in desperation with his snow-shoe, but the\r\nwind caught the clumsy framework, tripping the boy face downward\r\ninto the icy snow which cut and bruised his face.\r\n\r\nChoking and gasping for breath he struggled to his feet again now\r\nforcing his way forward blindly in the vague hope of stumbling upon\r\nthe elusive Martin. He was numb with the cold and exhausted by his\r\nviolent efforts; and while he strove to face the blast, he found\r\nhimself turning instinctively from it, while Kim, with seeming\r\nperversity strained at the traces, first in one direction and then\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nFor a few minutes this struggle continued, and then a feeling of\r\nirresistible drowsiness came over the boy. Standing with his back to\r\nthe wind he no longer felt the keen bite of the cold; and as he was\r\nable to accomplish nothing by trying to go forward, he crouched down\r\nbehind the toboggan, mindful of Martin’s oft-repeated instructions\r\nto keep moving to avoid freezing, but too much overcome to heed it.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the old hunter was in a far more distressed state of mind.\r\nWhen the storm struck he had turned and shouted to Larry to keep\r\nclose to the tail of his toboggan, meanwhile fumbling to get his\r\ncompass from his pocket, for he knew that only the needle could hold\r\nhim to his course. It was just at this time that Larry’s lashes had\r\nfrozen together, and he had stopped to rub them open, so that he did\r\nnot overtake Martin’s sledge as the old man expected. And when the\r\nold hunter looked up from fumbling with the compass a moment later,\r\nthe storm had blotted out the boy completely.\r\n\r\nInstantly the old man brought his dog about to return to the other\r\nsled, which was at most thirty yards away; but the heavy load,\r\nclogged by the snow, moved slowly, and by the time he reached what\r\nhe felt sure must be the spot where Larry had stood the boy had\r\nvanished. He was indeed only a few feet away, struggling desperately\r\nwith Kim who instinctively was striving to reach the other toboggan;\r\nbut in that storm an object thirty feet away was as completely\r\nblotted out as if the interval had been miles instead of feet.\r\n\r\nMartin knew that in a very short time the boy, struggling aimlessly\r\nin the storm, would be overcome and frozen, and he realized that his\r\nchance of finding him was desperate, as he could neither hear nor\r\nsee anything two yards ahead. His only hope lay in the sagacity of\r\nthe dog. So without a moment’s hesitation at the terrible risk he\r\nwas taking he cut the traces freeing the dog from his sled, and,\r\nleaving the load of precious supplies standing where it was, sent\r\nthe animal ahead, holding the leash to restrain it. Guided by the\r\ncompass he began walking in narrowing circles, trusting to the dog\r\nto find its mate should they pass near it. If he succeeded he could\r\nweather the storm by the aid of the supplies on the boy’s toboggan.\r\nIf he failed?--well, the storm would shorten the end mercifully; and\r\nthe boy would have gone on before him.\r\n\r\nFor half an hour he fought his circular course through the storm,\r\nJack plodding ahead, crouched down to resist the blast. Then the\r\nanimal suddenly straightened up on its legs, and plunged off to one\r\nside barking excitedly, and jerking Martin after him. A few short\r\nleaps brought them to where Larry lay curled down behind the\r\ntoboggan.\r\n\r\nKim, who had been curled up beside the boy, sprang up to meet his\r\nmate, jerking Larry about in his excitement, as they were still\r\nfastened together in harness. But even this violent shaking only\r\nroused the boy for a moment, who dropped back into a doze\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\nThe situation confronting Martin was desperate. Larry was rapidly\r\nfreezing, and as the nearest shelter of the woods was several miles\r\naway, it was useless to attempt to reach it. The only alternative\r\nwas to try to make such shelter as he could with the supplies on\r\nLarry’s sled. Fortunately in distributing the packs the day before\r\nhe had put the tent on Larry’s toboggan, and now he conceived a plan\r\nfor using it, although it would be sheer madness to attempt to pitch\r\nit in a gale that almost blew the dogs off their feet at times.\r\n\r\nFirst of all he pulled out Larry’s fur sleeping bag and, crouching\r\nbehind the load, managed to get the stupified boy into it, twisting\r\nthe top of the bag over his head so that the boy’s own breath would\r\nhelp warm him. Then he took out the tent, standing with his back to\r\nthe blast and with the toboggan load in front of him, he gradually\r\nworked it over one end of the load and under the sled.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that this tent was made with the floor cloth\r\nsewn firmly to the side walls so that it was in effect a great bag.\r\nMartin worked the opening of this bag around the sled, fighting\r\nfiercely against the gale, and then forced the sled into the bottom,\r\nturning it at right angles to the wind. In this way he formed a\r\nbarrier on the inside of the low tent. Then he pushed Larry in his\r\nsleeping bag inside, and he and the dogs crawled in and huddled\r\ntogether. Next he gathered together the loose edges of the opening\r\nof the tent and tied them with the guy ropes, thus shutting out the\r\nstorm on every side and amply protected on the side where the wind\r\nwas fiercest by the loaded sled.\r\n\r\nThe old hunter, accustomed to severe cold, and heated by his\r\nexertions, was warm and comfortable for the moment, at least, in\r\nthis nest; and the dogs found their lodgings so agreeable that they\r\nlicked the snow from between their toes, and soon curled up for a\r\nnap. But Larry still remained motionless, and when Martin felt\r\ninside the bag he found his face cold. Evidently the little warmth\r\nleft in the boy’s body was not sufficient to warm him back to life,\r\neven in the sleepng bag.\r\n\r\nClosing the bag again to retain what warmth there was inside, Martin\r\nripped open the lacings of the sled, and fumbling about found\r\nLarry’s tin cup, a tin plate, and the little box containing the\r\ncubes of “solid alcohol.” Placing one of these on the bottom of an\r\noverturned tin plate the old hunter struck a match and lighted it,\r\nkeeping the dish between his outspread knees to prevent the dogs\r\nknocking against it, and using his rifle as a tent pole to raise the\r\ncanvas as high as possible. It was a hazardous thing to do, as they\r\nwere all crowded into a space so small there was scarcely room for\r\nall of them to curl up together, to say nothing of space for\r\nstarting a fire. But Larry’s case was desperate: Martin must find\r\nsome way of warming him. And even a very tiny flame in that closely\r\npacked space would soon do this.\r\n\r\nAs the little blue flame grew larger and flickered upwards, the dogs\r\ninstinctively drew away from it, crowding close to the tent walls,\r\nin this way leaving Martin a little more elbow room. It also gave\r\nhim an opportunity carefully to work loose part of the fastening so\r\nas to make an opening a few inches long on the leeward side of the\r\ntent for ventilation. For as the tent cloth was practically air\r\ntight the flame and the breath from four pairs of lungs quickly made\r\nthe atmosphere stifling. But Martin did not wait for this warmth\r\nalone to start up the boy’s flagging circulation. He scooped a tin\r\ncup full of snow, reaching through the ventilating slit, and holding\r\nthis over the flame, melted and warmed it.\r\n\r\nEach little cube was supposed to burn for ten minutes, and give out\r\nan amount of heat entirely disproportionate to its size. But the\r\nfirst cube had burned itself out and a second one was half consumed\r\nbefore Martin secured half a cup of steaming hot water. Meanwhile\r\nLarry had not roused, although his face was warmer and he was\r\nbreathing more naturally. A few sips of the hot water forced between\r\nhis lips, however, roused him quickly; and by the time he had\r\nswallowed the contents of the cup the color had come back to his\r\ncheeks.\r\n\r\nThe hot water warmed his tingling body like magic, and by the time\r\nthe third cube was burned out his cheeks were pink and even the tips\r\nof his fingers warm. But Martin was not satisfied with this. He dug\r\nout some lumps of pemmican, heated them in the flame, and fed him\r\nthe bits as they became warm, occasionally taking a mouthful\r\nhimself, and giving some to the dogs as a reward for good behavior.\r\nBy the time the last cube had burned itself out they had all made a\r\nhearty meal, and Larry was feeling like himself again, warm and\r\ncomfortable in the fur bag.\r\n\r\nBut now Martin found himself in a dilemma. His own sleeping bag was\r\nsomewhere on his sled lost in the blizzard; and while his clothing\r\nwas warm, he soon realized that it would not be enough protection to\r\nkeep him from freezing in a few hours, now that the cubes were all\r\ngone. There was only one thing to be done: he must wedge himself in\r\nbeside the boy and share his warm bag until the storm subsided.\r\nLuckily for him the bag was a full-sized one like his own. So that\r\nby dint of much wriggling and squeezing he managed to crawl in\r\nbeside the boy and pull the folds over his head, although it was\r\nsuch a tight fit that neither of them could move when it was finally\r\naccomplished.\r\n\r\nThey were warm, however, and other discomforts were a minor\r\nconsideration. And in a few moments all hands were sleeping soundly\r\nwhile the storm raged about their little tent. All the rest of that\r\nday and well into the night it roared incessantly. Then gradually it\r\nbegan to abate in fury, and finally “blew itself out” as Martin\r\nsaid. By sunrise there was scarcely a breath of air stirring, but\r\neverything creaked and sparkled in the cold.\r\n\r\nGetting out of the bag proved to be almost as hard a task as getting\r\ninto it, but the old hunter finally worked his arms free and then\r\ncrawled out, pulling the boy after him. Both were stiff and lame\r\nfrom lying in the cramped position, but they were soon limbered up\r\nby dancing about to keep warm while they gnawed at the frozen\r\npemmican and packed the sled.\r\n\r\nFortunately the fury of the wind had swept the plain clear of new\r\nsnow as fast as it had fallen on the glassy crust, so that the few\r\nelevations on its surface were easily seen. One of these a quarter\r\nof a mile away proved to be Martin’s sled, clear of snow on the\r\nwindward side, with a long pointed bank slanting off to leeward. So\r\nthat in half an hour’s time they had recovered it, harnessed the\r\ndogs, and were making their way as quickly as possible to the edge\r\nof the woods for which they were aiming the day before.\r\n\r\nThe distance proved to be short--only a scant three miles. But Larry\r\nwas still weak, and was tottering and almost exhausted when they\r\nfinally wallowed through the snowbanks at the edge of the great\r\nspruce forest. He had said nothing to Martin of his weakness, but\r\nthe old man had been watching him out of the corner of his eye and\r\nwas well aware of his condition.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they reached an open space among the trees, therefore,\r\nMartin stopped and made a roaring fire, while Larry sat on his sled\r\nand rested, watching the old man brewing tea and cooking a hot meal.\r\nHis legs ached and his head swam a little, although he was beginning\r\nto feel more like his old self by the time their breakfast was over.\r\nBut the thought of the weary hours of toil through the woods was\r\nalmost intolerable; and he was ready to cry for joy when Martin\r\nannounced that he “was going to look around for a camp,” leaving the\r\nboy to toast his shins by the fire. “And I may find something to\r\nshoot while I’m looking,” the old hunter added as he started on his\r\nsearch.\r\n\r\nIn half an hour Martin returned fairly beaming at his success. He\r\nhad found no game, but he had stumbled upon a camping place which he\r\nannounced was “the best in all Canada.” “And these woods are full of\r\ngame, too,” he added.\r\n\r\nThe camping place which Martin had discovered was indeed an ideal,\r\nas well as a very unusual one. It was a natural excavation under the\r\nsouth side of an overhanging ledge of rock which was so protected\r\nfrom the wind that only a thin layer of snow covered its rock floor.\r\nA roaring fire built at the entrance warmed the hollowed out space\r\nlike a great room, and Larry found that the old hunter had started\r\nsuch a fire and left it to warm things up while he returned for the\r\ntoboggans. It seemed a sylvan paradise to the exhausted boy.\r\n\r\nThe hunter watched the boy slyly as they stood in the warm glow by\r\nthe fire. “Perhaps you’d rather go on than to stop here over\r\nto-morrow,” he suggested with a twinkle in his eye.\r\n\r\nFor answer the boy threw off his heavy coat, went over to his\r\ntoboggan, and began unfastening Kim and unpacking his load. And\r\nMartin with a little laugh followed his example.\r\n\r\n“You’ll stay and keep house to-morrow,” he explained as he worked,\r\n“while I go out and have a try at some of this fresh meat that is\r\nrunning loose around here. We need a supply to take the place of\r\nwhat we’ve eaten in the last week, and I never saw a likelier place\r\nfor getting it, judging by the signs.”\r\n\r\nAll the afternoon the tireless old man worked laying in a supply of\r\nfuel and making things snug, not allowing the boy to help, but\r\nmaking him “tend camp” lying on a pile of warm furs beside the fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n                         THE TIMBER WOLVES\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly the next morning Martin roused Larry for breakfast. The old\r\nman had been up an hour and was ready to start on his hunt as soon\r\nas breakfast was finished, but he had let the boy sleep as long as\r\npossible. While they ate Martin gave Larry final instructions as to\r\nwhat he was to do during the day.\r\n\r\n“Rest all you can,” he instructed, “and don’t go far from camp under\r\nany circumstances. Don’t let the dogs loose even for a minute. It\r\nisn’t likely that they would wander off, but they might get started\r\nafter a rabbit and wind up chasing caribou or fighting wolves.\r\nAnyhow don’t give them a chance.”\r\n\r\nAt the mention of wolves the boy looked anxious. “What if the wolves\r\ncame near here--came right up to the camp and wanted to fight Jack\r\nand Kim?” he asked.\r\n\r\nThe old man pointed to the little rifle standing against the wall.\r\n“Give ’em the thirty-eight,” he said. “But they won’t come very\r\nnear,” he added. “They’ll be howling around in the distance of\r\ncourse, because they will scent our cooking. But at worst they\r\nwouldn’t dare come near until night; and I’ll be here by that time.\r\nAnd always remember this: a wolf is a coward; and your thirty-eight\r\nwill knock dead in his tracks the biggest wolf that ever lived. Just\r\nkeep the little gun strapped on you all day and you won’t be afraid\r\nor feel lonesome. Next to a man a gun is the most comforting\r\ncompanion in the world.”\r\n\r\nLarry followed Martin’s instructions almost to the letter. He\r\nstrapped on the gun and loafed about the camp-fire all the long\r\nforenoon, varying the monotony by patting and talking to the dogs,\r\nwho lolled luxuriously beside the fire where Martin had tied them\r\nwith double leashes. By noon the period of idleness palled on the\r\nboy who had entirely recovered from the exhaustion of the day\r\nbefore. So he took his axe and spent a couple of hours gathering\r\nfuel although Martin’s huge pile was still more than sufficient for\r\nanother day.\r\n\r\nAt intervals he heard wolves howling at a distance, but that had now\r\nbecome a familiar sound, and he paid little attention to it. When\r\nthe sun was only an hour high he began getting supper ready, keeping\r\na sharp lookout for Martin who might appear at any minute. He had\r\nplanned an unusually elaborate meal to surprise and cheer the old\r\nman when he returned, and he was so occupied with the work that he\r\nwas oblivious to everything else, until the dogs startled him by\r\nspringing up, bristling and snarling fiercely. Thinking that they\r\nhad scented or sighted the returning hunter Larry ran out to look\r\nfor him, shouting a welcome. But there was no sign of the old man.\r\n\r\nIn dismay he noticed that the sun was just setting, and on looking\r\nthrough the trees in the direction indicated by the dogs’ attitude\r\nhe saw the silhouettes of four huge, gaunt wolves skulking among the\r\ntrees. The odor of his elaborate cooking had reached them, and as\r\nnight was coming on they were emboldened to approach.\r\n\r\nThe sight of the great creatures snarling and snapping in the gloomy\r\nshadows made the “goose flesh” rise on the boy’s skin. And while the\r\npresence of the dogs was a comfort, their attitude was not\r\nreassuring. They pulled and strained at their leashes, bristling and\r\ngrowling, but sometimes whining as if realizing that in a pitched\r\nbattle they would be no match for the four invaders.\r\n\r\nThe realization that he was utterly alone in the great wilderness\r\nwith darkness at hand, and a pack of wolves howling at his open door\r\nmade the boy chill with terror. Instinctively he sought shelter\r\nbehind the fire near the dogs, who welcomed him with appreciative\r\nwhines. They looked upon him as a protector, and their faith helped\r\nhis courage. Martin’s instruction to “give ’em the thirty-eight”\r\nalso cheered him, and he took out the little gun and prepared for\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\n“Every wolf is a coward,” the old hunter had said; but these wolves\r\nwere not acting like cowards at all. They did not rush forward\r\nboldly, it was true, but they were stealthily drawing nearer,\r\nsnarling and bristling. They would stand pawing and sniffing the\r\nsnow for a few moments as if the object of their visit was entirely\r\nforgotten. Then one of them would suddenly spring forward two or\r\nthree short steps, and the whole crew would stand snapping their\r\njaws and glaring savagely at the camp. In this way they were\r\ndeliberately closing in upon it.\r\n\r\nThis method of approaching by short rushes was most disconcerting\r\nand terrifying, and several times Larry decided to open fire without\r\nwaiting for the wolves to emerge from the shelter of the trees. But\r\neach time his better judgment restrained him.\r\n\r\nWhen they had approached to within the circle of the nearest trees,\r\nhowever, he decided to act. Holding some cartridges in his left hand\r\nfor quick loading, as Martin had taught him, he knelt beside the\r\nfire, rested his elbow on his knee, and tried to take careful aim.\r\nBut his hand trembled, and his heart pounded so hard, that the\r\nsights of his rifle bobbed all about the mark he had selected. The\r\nmore he tried to steady the rifle the more it seemed to waver and\r\ndance about, so that he knew it would be useless to fire.\r\n\r\nAt that moment the story of Weewah, the Indian boy, flashed into his\r\nmind--the little savage who fought with a hatchet, while he, the\r\nwhite boy, had his hard-hitting rifle and plenty of cartridges. He\r\nlowered the gun for a moment, and steadied himself with a few deep\r\nbreaths, shutting his eyes and summoning all his courage. When he\r\nopened them he found that his hand was steadier and the pounding in\r\nhis breast had almost ceased.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the wolves had spread out forming a restless semicircle\r\nbefore the camp. There were three gray ones, and one huge fellow\r\nalmost pure white. Larry selected this white one for his first\r\nvictim. Resting his elbow again on his knee he took careful aim,\r\nwaiting for the restless wolf to pause for an instant. The moment\r\nthe huge animal stopped to snarl fiercely at the camp, Larry pressed\r\nthe trigger and fired.\r\n\r\nAt the sound of the report three of the wolves gave a startled leap\r\nsidewise, and then crouched forward again as they recovered from\r\ntheir surprise. But the white wolf sank in the snow where it stood,\r\nand lay still: the little bullet had “knocked him dead in his\r\ntracks” sure enough. With a gulp of exultation Larry slipped in a\r\nfresh cartridge and aimed carefully at a wolf that was a little in\r\nadvance of the other two. Again his aim was true; but this wolf did\r\nnot drop silently as had the white one. Instead he gave a howl of\r\npain and rolled in the snow, turning it red all about him in his\r\ndeath struggles.\r\n\r\nThe other two wolves had leaped back at the flash and sound of the\r\nrifle as before. But at the sight and smell of their companion’s\r\nblood they rushed upon him, tearing and gashing him in their lust,\r\nand sucking his blood ravenously. Jack and Kim, made frantic by the\r\nstruggle, added their furious but impotent howls to the uproar in\r\ntheir frenzied efforts to free themselves. While Larry, forgetful of\r\npersonal danger in the excitement, sprang up and approached the\r\nstruggling group, meanwhile inserting a fresh cartridge, and\r\ndespatched the third wolf as he crouched wallowing in his\r\ncompanion’s blood.\r\n\r\nThe remaining wolf had paid no attention to the report that struck\r\ndown his mate; but now as the boy paused to take careful aim, the\r\nhuge creature, maddened by the taste of blood, turned suddenly and\r\nrushed upon him. There was no time to retreat, even if Larry had\r\nwished to do so. But he had no such intention, for the hot blood of\r\nfighting ancestors was now surging through his veins. With the\r\ncoolness of a veteran the boy aimed and fired just as the gray\r\nmonster shot through the air in his final spring toward him. The\r\nnext instant his coat sleeve was ripped open clean to the shoulder\r\nby the furious snap of the animal’s jaws, and he was knocked\r\nheadlong by the impact of the creature’s body.\r\n\r\nFortunately for him his bullet had found its mark, breaking the\r\nwolf’s back just as the animal leaped from the ground, and thus\r\ndiverting the aim of its deadly jaws, while the force of its spring\r\nknocked Larry out of the wounded creature’s reach. Its hind legs\r\nwere paralyzed and useless, but its jaws snapped viciously as it\r\nstruggled to reach its foe on its fore legs.\r\n\r\nThe boy was up in an instant, maddened by his fall, and full of\r\nfight. Without trying to recover his gun which had fallen several\r\nfeet away, he rushed to the pile of fire-wood, seized a heavy club,\r\nand brought it down again and again on the head of the crippled\r\nbeast, until he had pounded out the last spark of life. Then, when\r\nit was all over, he stood trembling and weak, overcome by his\r\nefforts and the excitement.\r\n\r\nA moment later he ran to the dogs and, regardless of Martin’s\r\norders, turned them loose. He wanted them to share his victory, and\r\nstood laughing and gulping hysterically as he watched them rush upon\r\nthe lifeless victims, and tear and maul them with wolfish ferocity.\r\nIt was no fault of theirs that they had not shared the fight, and\r\nthey vented their animosity by rushing from one victim to another,\r\njerking the limp carcasses about, and shaking them like rats.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile it had grown dark; and still no sign of Martin. For a\r\nlittle time after the battle Larry had stood forgetful of the old\r\nman’s absence, reveling in the thought of the story he should have\r\nto tell. But presently he realized the seriousness of his position.\r\nHe no longer feared for his own safety: he and his little gun could\r\n“tend camp” against all comers he felt sure. But what was keeping\r\nMartin away so long?\r\n\r\nHe consoled himself with the thought that probably the old man had\r\nfollowed some game trail farther than he intended and was unable to\r\nget back before nightfall. So when the dogs had tired themselves out\r\nworrying the dead wolves, Larry tied them up and ate his cheerless\r\nsupper. This revived his spirits a little, and he put into effect a\r\nplan he had made for surprising Martin. For this purpose he dragged\r\nthe carcasses of the wolves together and covered them with boughs so\r\nthat the old man would not notice them when he returned. At the\r\nright time the boy would tell his story and revel in Martin’s\r\nastonishment.\r\n\r\nThen he built up a roaring fire, crawled into his sleeping bag and\r\ntried to sleep. But after two hours of restless tossing about, his\r\nmind filled with gloomy forebodings, he got up and seated himself\r\nbeside the fire for his long vigil.\r\n\r\nIt was a terrible night for the boy. The thought that Martin might\r\nhave been injured, or even killed, kept obtruding itself, and he\r\nshuddered at the awful consequences of such a calamity. He reassured\r\nhimself over and over by the more probable explanation that the old\r\nman had gone farther from camp than he intended. But the other\r\npossibility could not be banished from his thoughts. And so he sat\r\nbefore his roaring fire, a big dog snuggling against him on either\r\nside, comforting his loneliness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER X\r\n\r\n                         THE WOUNDED MOOSE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this way he passed the long, terrible hours of the night. But as\r\nsoon as it began to grow light he untied the dogs, and took a circle\r\nof several miles through the woods, hoping that he might find some\r\ntrace of the missing hunter. But he remembered the old man’s\r\ninstruction that he was not to leave the camp to go any very great\r\ndistance, and after two hours of futile search he returned in\r\ndespair.\r\n\r\nThe dogs, seeming to realize that something was wrong, were alert to\r\nevery unusual sound; and when Larry would spring up and peer through\r\nthe trees expectantly, they would leap about and bark excitedly. But\r\nthe sun rose higher and higher, and still Martin did not come.\r\n\r\nAt last the boy could stand the suspense no longer. In defiance of\r\nMartin’s explicit instructions he decided to leave the camp and try\r\nto find him. The thought that the old man must have been injured, or\r\ntaken ill, kept forcing itself into the boy’s mind. An experienced\r\nhunter like Martin would not lose his way; and moreover, if he\r\nshould become confused, he would still have his own trail to follow\r\nback to camp; for this trail was well marked in the snow. In any\r\nevent, Larry could not remain inactive any longer with these\r\nterrible fears tearing at his heart.\r\n\r\nSo he harnessed the dogs tandem to one of the empty toboggans,\r\nstrapped on his snow-shoes, and started out following Martin’s trail\r\nof the day before. At first he took the lead, running at top speed;\r\nbut presently he found that, since the trail had been broken out by\r\nMartin, he could make better time by letting the dogs haul him on\r\nthe toboggan. His weight was so much less than the load they were\r\naccustomed to haul that now they ran along the trail at high speed,\r\nfollowing Martin’s tracks without any guiding instructions.\r\n\r\nFor two hours they went forward, Kim leading, his nose close to the\r\nsnow, and both dogs keenly alert. The tracks wound in and out among\r\nthe thickets, indicating where Martin had explored likely looking\r\nplaces for game, but their general direction was toward the\r\nsouthwest, the course the old hunter had said he should take. Once\r\nthe snow-shoe trail had followed the track of a deer for half a\r\nmile; but evidently the animal was not overtaken, for presently they\r\nfound where Martin turned off into his original course again.\r\n\r\nBy noon the dogs had begun to slacken their pace a little, and\r\nLarry, thoroughly discouraged, had decided that he would retrace his\r\ncourse, when they reached the crest of a low hill a short distance\r\nahead, which seemed to command a view of the country for some\r\ndistance around. If nothing could be seen of Martin from this hill,\r\nhe would face about and return to camp; and more than likely he\r\nshould find the old man there waiting for him. Hardly had he reached\r\nthis decision, however, when Kim stopped so suddenly that Jack and\r\nthe toboggan bumped into him, and stood with bristling hair and\r\nstiffened muscles for a moment, and then made a frantic leap\r\nforward, snarling and barking.\r\n\r\nAt the same time Jack seemed to have discovered the cause of his\r\nmate’s excitement, and it was only by twisting the sled rope about a\r\nsapling that Larry prevented them from dashing madly off into the\r\nwoods. Yet he was unable to discover the cause of their actions,\r\nalthough he peered intently through the trees in all directions. But\r\nwhatever the cause, he knew that they had scented something quite\r\nout of the ordinary; and as a precaution he drew the little rifle\r\nfrom its case and made sure that the firing-pin was set for the\r\nheavy cartridge.\r\n\r\nThen he took a firm grip on Kim’s collar, putting all his weight\r\nagainst the dog’s strength, and advanced cautiously through the\r\ntrees toward the top of the hill.\r\n\r\nThe crest of this hill had been cleared of large timber years before\r\nby a forest fire, and there was an open space for several hundred\r\nyards beyond. When Larry reached this cleared space he saw a sight\r\nthat made his heart leap into his throat and his hair seem to lift\r\nhis cap. His hand trembled so violently that he came near dropping\r\nhis rifle, and his breathing ceased altogether for a moment.\r\n\r\nFor at the opposite side of the clearing stood a huge animal, tall\r\nand gaunt, its thick neck supporting a head like a great black\r\nbarrel crowned with a pair of thickly pointed horns that seemed as\r\nlong as the toboggan from tip to tip. The great creature stood\r\nfacing him, the long, coarse hair about its head and neck standing\r\nout straight, its fore legs wide apart, its hind legs slightly bent\r\nready for a spring forward. All about it for a space of several\r\nyards the snow was trampled into a hard bed and blotched with blood.\r\n\r\nIn the center of this trampled space was a huge boulder, and just\r\nbeside it a sapling perhaps six inches in diameter. Perched on the\r\ntop of the boulder and only a few inches out of reach of the great\r\nantlers, old Martin lay huddled. Or, to be more exact, what appeared\r\nto be a bundle of Martin’s clothes that looked as if they might have\r\nbeen hurled there by the infuriated animal. The mystery of the old\r\nman’s failure to return to camp was explained.\r\n\r\nAt the sight of the huge animal so close at hand the dogs became\r\nabsolutely frantic; and knowing that it would be folly to try to\r\ncontrol them further, and wishing to give them every possible\r\nadvantage in the fight that was now inevitable, the boy slipped the\r\nharness from each.\r\n\r\nAs the dogs bounded toward the wounded animal, the moose sprang\r\nforward to meet them, snorting fiercely; but in doing this the heavy\r\ncreature put itself at once at a disadvantage. For its hoofs broke\r\nthrough the crust at every step, while the dogs kept their footing\r\non the surface, darting in and out, snapping fiercely at legs and\r\nflank.\r\n\r\nThe noise of this battle roused Martin from the stupor into which he\r\nhad fallen, so that he raised his head, and then gradually dragged\r\nhimself into a sitting posture. Then, as he recognized the dogs, and\r\nsaw Larry hurrying forward, new life thrilled the old man, and he\r\nbegan waving his hand and shouting feebly to the boy.\r\n\r\nAt first his voice was so low that the boy could not hear it above\r\nthe din; but as he approached the rock, waiting for a favoring\r\nmoment to place his one shot in some vital spot, he could make out\r\nsome of Martin’s instructions shouted through his trumpeted hands.\r\n\r\n“Steady, boy, steady!” the old man shouted. “Wait till he turns his\r\nhead, and shoot between the eyes! Not now--wait till he turns--not\r\nyet--!”\r\n\r\nJust then the moose, frantic with pain and anger, caught sight of\r\nthe boy approaching him. At this discovery the huge animal seemed to\r\nforget the dogs, and wheeling, made straight for Larry, head down,\r\nbristles standing, and bloody foam blowing from its nose and mouth.\r\n\r\n“Shoot! Shoot! For God’s sake shoot, Larry!” the old man screamed,\r\nhalf rising, and then toppling back upon the rock.\r\n\r\nBut Larry needed no instructions. He had proved himself and his\r\nweapon only yesterday, and he had the courage born of experience.\r\nThe first terror inspired by the huge animal had passed, and now he\r\nstood with his feet braced wide apart on his snow-shoes, the rifle\r\nat his shoulder and his eye fixed on the little bead of the front\r\nsight as the huge animal plunged toward him. Kim and Jack, realizing\r\nthe impending danger to their master, buried their teeth in the\r\nmoose’s flanks on either side and hung on grimly causing the animal\r\nto pause momentarily. This was Larry’s chance. There was a flash and\r\nreport, and the big animal, rearing upwards and sinking on its hind\r\nlegs, plunged sidelong into the snow and lay still. The heavy\r\nsteel-jacketed bullet had crashed into its brain, killing it\r\ninstantly.\r\n\r\nBefore the huge head fairly reached the ground both dogs were at the\r\nanimal’s throat, tearing and mangling, mad with the lust of battle.\r\nLarry, reacting from the tense excitement, felt his knees sag under\r\nhim as he realized the result of the shot. But even this did not\r\nmake him forget to load his gun again instantly--a thing that becomes\r\nautomatic with the hunter--and approach the beast cautiously, ready\r\nfor another shot. But the dogs, with fangs buried in the creature’s\r\nthroat, gloating in the hot blood, bore silent witness that more\r\nshots were unnecessary.\r\n\r\nThen Larry’s pent-up emotions found expression in a wild shout as he\r\nrushed to where old Martin lay.\r\n\r\nBut his feeling changed to dread apprehension when he reached the\r\nbase of the rock, saw where the blood had trickled down over the\r\nside, and found that the old man had fallen back unconscious.\r\nPerhaps his triumph had come too late after all! In an instant he\r\nhad kicked off his snow-shoes, climbed the sapling that rose beside\r\nthe rock, and was kneeling over the still, crumpled figure, his warm\r\nhands caressing the white cheeks, his voice choked with emotion.\r\n\r\nHis warm touch revived the hunter, who opened his eyes slowly, and\r\nthen smiled faintly up at the boy.\r\n\r\n“I’ll be all right in a minute,” the old fellow whispered; “get me\r\noff this rock and build a fire, quick. I’m frozen.”\r\n\r\nBut getting the injured hunter off the rocks without hurting him\r\nproved a difficult task. The sides were almost perpendicular, and\r\nMartin too weak to help himself at all. So, after several futile\r\nattempts, Larry was obliged to get the harnesses from the toboggan,\r\nfasten the draw strap under the hunter’s arms, and in this manner\r\nlower him over the side. Then the boy quickly gathered some sticks\r\nand made a hot fire.\r\n\r\nDuring most of this time Martin remained inanimate, but he revived\r\nagain when Larry had dragged him near the fire; and now he asked\r\nfaintly for water. A few gulps of the melted snow water from Larry’s\r\ncup revived him perceptibly, and meanwhile the boy was chafing his\r\ncold hands, and had removed his moccasins and drawn his feet close\r\nto the fire.\r\n\r\nPresently Martin asked feebly for food; but Larry shook his head.\r\nFor once he had forgotten one of the old man’s reiterated\r\ninstructions--that he should never go anywhere from camp without\r\ntaking at least one ration with him. When he started out he had only\r\nexpected to be gone a few hours, and in his perturbation he had\r\nforgotten to take anything to eat.\r\n\r\nBut the old hunter’s wits had not completely failed him.\r\n\r\n“The moose,” he said faintly.\r\n\r\nAnd then the boy remembered that a month’s supply of food, upon\r\nwhich the dogs were still feasting, was lying only a few feet away.\r\nSo in a few minutes he had a huge slice of moose steak suspended on\r\na stick over the fire, from which he cut off thin strips and fed to\r\nthe ravenous hunter.\r\n\r\nDuring this process he had time to observe the nature of Martin’s\r\ninjury, although he was not quite sure of its exact location, as the\r\nhunter’s clothes were rent and blood-stained in many places.\r\n\r\n“It’s my left leg,” Martin said, interpreting the boy’s anxious\r\nexpression. “It’s all ripped to pieces. But it was the cold that was\r\nkilling me. Now I’m getting warm and feeling stronger every minute.\r\nIn another half hour I’ll be ready to take a ride home with you\r\nwhile the sun is high.”\r\n\r\nBy the time the steak was consumed Martin was sitting up, taking\r\nsips of hot water out of the tin cup from time to time. Every\r\nmovement caused him great pain, but he strove stoically to conceal\r\nthis from the boy.\r\n\r\n“Harness up the dogs,” he said presently, “pack me into the\r\ntoboggan, and let’s start for camp. We haven’t any time to lose, for\r\nit gets cold on a sled when the sun goes down.”\r\n\r\nSo Larry called the dogs, who were loth to leave their feast, packed\r\nthe old man into the bag on the toboggan so that only his head\r\nshowed above the flaps, and started.\r\n\r\nSeveral times he had tried to get the old hunter to tell him how it\r\nhad all happened; but Martin put him off, assuring him that there\r\nwould be plenty of time for talking when they were back in camp\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nOnce the start was made there was no chance for talking, all Larry’s\r\nenergies being required to keep the now lazy dogs up to their usual\r\nspeed. And now he realized the wisdom of not feeding them until\r\ntheir day’s work was done, as was Martin’s inflexible rule. He was\r\nkept busy steering the toboggan around rough places that would jar\r\nhis passenger, as the old man’s excruciating pain was accentuated by\r\nevery additional shock. Yet Martin would not consider stopping, or\r\neven slackening the pace; and as the dogs warmed to their work after\r\nthe first few miles they were able to make the camp just as the sun\r\nwas setting, all hands ready to drop from exhaustion.\r\n\r\nThey found Larry’s big fire still burning, and in a few minutes he\r\nhad warmed up the remains of the feast he had planned for the night\r\nbefore. Then, when he had wrapped up the injured leg, and propped\r\nthe old hunter in a comfortable position before the fire, Martin was\r\nready to tell his story.\r\n\r\n“Don’t you mind now, and look scared whenever I screw up my face,”\r\nthe old man began; “for the pain shoots around pretty bad at times.\r\nBut I’ll stand it all right, and I’ll kill many a bull moose to pay\r\nfor it, too.”\r\n\r\nThen he chuckled softly in the old familiar manner.\r\n\r\n“What makes me laugh,” he said, “is to think that all this time I\r\nhave been letting you think that I am something of a hunter, trying\r\nto show you how to kill game; and here you go out and kill the moose\r\nthat came mighty near killing me. This is how it all happened:\r\n\r\n“I came across signs of game after I had left the camp about an\r\nhour, and the signs were good too; but still I didn’t get sight of\r\nanything, and I kept going right on until well after noon. So I\r\ndecided to turn about and take the back track home, feeling sure\r\nthat I should have better luck on the way in. Sure enough, when I\r\ncame near the place where you found me, I found where a moose had\r\nfloundered along through the snow, probably scared from some yard by\r\nmy scent as I passed. He was standing near the big rock and as the\r\nwind was blowing toward me, he hadn’t discovered me.\r\n\r\n“So I worked around to get the rock between us, and then I sneaked\r\nup so as to get a close shot and make sure of him. I ought to have\r\ntried a longer shot at him, but you see the .38-40 is a pretty small\r\ncartridge for moose except at close range, and I intended to get\r\nhim, sure.\r\n\r\n“I sneaked along until I was right behind the rock, and then I\r\nstepped out and shot point blank for his head. But just at the very\r\nsecond I pulled the trigger the old rascal had to jerk his head\r\nabout six inches to one side, so that the bullet ploughed deep into\r\nhis neck, just where it would hurt and make him mad, but nothing\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n“And then all the trouble happened in about three seconds. I jerked\r\ndown the lever to throw in another cartridge, for he was coming\r\nright at me. But Jumping Jee-rusalem! if the old gun didn’t jam. The\r\nhead of the empty shell had broken off and stuck in the chamber! I\r\ndidn’t have any time for investigating, for the bull was right on\r\ntop of me, so I just jumped for the side of that rock. Nothing but a\r\nfly could have gone up it--without help; and I knew that then as well\r\nas I do now. But I hadn’t any choice. And the curious thing is that\r\nthe old moose himself furnished the _help_.\r\n\r\n“He was so close to me when I jumped that one of his points caught\r\nmy leg and ripped it open as he went along; but at the same time he\r\nflung his head up and threw me clean up the side of the rock. So by\r\nthe time he could stop and turn around I was up out of his reach.\r\nBut I was his meat, all the same. All he had to do was to sit down\r\nand wait long enough and I’d freeze or starve to death.\r\n\r\n“He had no notion of waiting, though,--that is, not at first. He\r\nplanned to come right up there and finish the job. But you see he\r\ndidn’t have any friend around to hook him in the leg and give him a\r\nboost as I had, so he couldn’t make it. He tried for a full hour,\r\ngetting madder and madder every minute, snorting and pawing up the\r\nsnow, and then coming back for another try at me. And there I had to\r\nsit and take it, with my gun lying down below in the snow.\r\n\r\n“Pretty soon I saw that the old scoundrel had settled down for a\r\nregular siege. He gave up trying to reach me, but he never took his\r\neyes off me, and just walked ’round and ’round that rock hoping I’d\r\ncome down. I’ll bet he made that circle a thousand times in two\r\nhours.\r\n\r\n“I thought when night came that he would start off and give it up,\r\nand several times he did go away behind a clump of trees a few rods\r\naway. But the minute I raised my head or moved a finger he was right\r\nback on the job again.\r\n\r\n“Then I knew that my time had come. It wasn’t such a terribly cold\r\nnight, you know, but I lay out there in the open with nothing over\r\nme, and I was mighty weak from the blood I’d lost. And I knew that I\r\nwas slowly freezing to death. I thought of a dozen things to try,\r\nbut all of them were hopeless. There was no use in sliding off and\r\ngrabbing the rifle for by the time I could get the broken cartridge\r\nout the moose would have killed me several times over. If it hadn’t\r\nbeen for the leg I’d have come down and fought it out with the old\r\nbrute with my hunting knife. I have done that before with a wounded\r\nbull. But I was so weak that I could hardly raise my body, let alone\r\nmy leg. So I just settled down to freeze.\r\n\r\n“But you see I’m a tough old rooster, and when the sun came up this\r\nmorning I was still there, with my moose taking good care that I\r\nshould _stay_ there. By that time, though, I didn’t care much\r\nwhether he stayed or not. It didn’t make any difference. For I\r\ncouldn’t have crawled fifty yards if I’d had the chance I was so\r\nstiff and weak.\r\n\r\n“After a while I dozed off; and the next thing I remember I heard\r\nthe bull fighting with some wolves. I thought they were wolves then,\r\nbut I didn’t even open my eyes to see, although I hoped they’d kill\r\nhim. And then something sounded familiar about those wolves’ voices,\r\nand I turned my head. And there was old Jack and Kim trying to even\r\nup my score with the old critter.\r\n\r\n“My God! boy, I never knew what it was to be glad about anything in\r\nmy life before! There you were coming with the little gun, and there\r\nwas Jack on one side and Kim on the other taking out hunks from the\r\nold moose’s side at every jump, and--”\r\n\r\nThe old man stopped, and brushed his arm across his eyes, unable to\r\ngo on for a minute, while Larry sat blinking hard at the fire. But\r\npresently the hunter regained his composure a little, and continued:\r\n\r\n“And then when you fired and shot that old devil right between the\r\neyes, I was willing to die for sheer joy.”\r\n\r\nThe old man paused again and tried to force a little laugh.\r\n\r\n“And to think that you had to come and kill him with the little gun,\r\nwhile the best that I could do was to make him mad.”\r\n\r\nAnd he patted the boy’s shaggy head affectionately.\r\n\r\n“But you see, Martin, I’ve been having more practice lately than you\r\nhave,” the boy said, springing up. “Wait till I show you something.”\r\n\r\nHe darted out of the tent and came struggling back hauling the big\r\nwhite wolf and dropped it before the fire, and then brought the\r\nother three and laid them in a row for Martin’s inspection. His eyes\r\nwere shining with pride and the old hunter’s face beamed with\r\ngenuine admiration.\r\n\r\n“Just four cartridges--one for each wolf,” Larry said proudly, “and a\r\nlittle tap with a club thrown in for good measure.” And then he told\r\nthe old man the story of the wolves, and exhibited the rip in his\r\ncoat sleeves.\r\n\r\nSeveral times during the recital Larry noticed that Martin’s face\r\ntwitched with the agonizing pain he was suffering, although the old\r\nman tried hard to conceal it, protesting that it was a thing too\r\nslight to be worth noticing.\r\n\r\n“It isn’t the pain so much,” the old man said, at last. “I can stand\r\nthat all right. But I could stand it just a thousand times better if\r\nI had my old pipe and one pinch of tobacco. Boy, I’d give one long\r\nyear of my life if I could have five minutes’ smoke. I’d get up and\r\nfight a moose, or a grizzly, or both, right now for a dozen whiffs\r\nof the old pipe.”\r\n\r\nWith a little laugh Larry jumped up, ran to their pile of plunder,\r\nand fumbled in his ditty bag. Then he turned and held up a pipe and\r\na plug of tobacco for Martin to see.\r\n\r\n“Will this new pipe do?” he asked, laughing, as he handed Martin the\r\nprecious articles.\r\n\r\nThe old man’s eyes were round with astonishment, and his hands\r\ntrembled with eagerness. They trembled so that he could hardly pare\r\noff the shavings of the plug and load the pipe, and light it with\r\nthe brand that Larry handed him from the fire. But a few whiffs\r\nsteadied him.\r\n\r\n“You see,” Larry explained, “when you told me to put something or\r\nother into my ditty bag for luck, I couldn’t think of anything that\r\nwould be luckier than a pipe and some tobacco for you--just to buy\r\nyou off some time when you got cranky, you know. So here’s your\r\nbribe to keep you good natured about my running off and leaving the\r\ncamp when you told me not to.”\r\n\r\n“Well, this makes twice to-day that you’ve saved my life,” the old\r\nman grinned, “so I’ll forgive you. And now pile some wood near me so\r\nthat I can keep the fire going, and then you crawl into bed and get\r\nsome sleep. I don’t suppose this moose leg of mine would let me\r\nsleep anyhow, but even if it did I wouldn’t waste my time doing it\r\nwhen there was a pipe and some tobacco around. I am almost glad now\r\nthat the old beast gouged me.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n                      THE RETURN TO THE WRECK\r\n\r\n\r\nMartin was in fine spirits when Larry finally crawled out of his\r\nsleeping bag and set about getting breakfast next morning. The\r\ninjured leg was stiff and useless, to be sure, but the acute pain\r\nhad subsided and did not bother the old man except when he attempted\r\nto move. “By to-morrow,” he assured the boy, “I’ll be ready to hit\r\nthe trail again.”\r\n\r\nLarry, with a perplexed look, turned from his work of frying moose\r\nmeat to see if Martin was in earnest.\r\n\r\n“I guess your tobacco has gone to your head, Martin, if you expect\r\nto be able to use that leg much by to-morrow,” he said indulgently.\r\n\r\n“I _don’t_ expect to be able to use it much by to-morrow,” Martin\r\nreplied simply, “but we’ll be moving all the same.”\r\n\r\nLarry set the frying pan down beside the fire, and came in and stood\r\nbefore the old man with his arms akimbo, scanning the old fellow’s\r\nimmobile face. For a moment or two they faced each other, neither of\r\nthem speaking and both looking very serious. Larry was puzzled but\r\ndetermined.\r\n\r\n“Now see here, Martin,” he began, “you don’t really suppose that you\r\nare going to be able to travel to-morrow, do you?”\r\n\r\n“I certainly do,” the old man replied without relaxing a muscle;\r\n“and what’s more to the point, I’m going to!”\r\n\r\n“But Martin,” Larry protested, “how do you expect that your leg\r\nwhich is so sore you can’t even move it to-day, will be so you can\r\nwalk on it to-morrow?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t,” Martin replied.\r\n\r\n“Then how do you suppose you are going to stumble on through these\r\nwoods mile after mile,” Larry persisted.\r\n\r\n“Who said anything about stumbling through these woods, or any other\r\nwoods?” the old hunter asked, with a twinkle in his eye. “You\r\nshouldn’t jump to conclusions, Larry.” And he chuckled at the boy’s\r\ndiscomfiture.\r\n\r\nLarry gave a defiant toss of his head and returned to his frying\r\npan. “Kim and Jack and I are going to eat our breakfast now,” he\r\nannounced with a grin. “Perhaps you can beg some breakfast too when\r\nyou are ready to tell me what you are driving at.”\r\n\r\n“All right,” Martin capitulated; “I’m too hungry to be stubborn.\r\nBring on the breakfast and we’ll talk while we eat. I’ve been\r\nthinking this thing all out during the night, and here it is:\r\n\r\n“We’re going to travel to-morrow, but I intend to ride. I am going\r\nto have you pack me on the sled with a few days’ stock of food, and\r\nget Kim and Jack to haul me. You can come along as escort, if you\r\ncare to. In fact if you don’t care to I shan’t go, and we’ll spend\r\nthe winter here and starve, instead of going back to the yacht to\r\nget fat.”\r\n\r\nAt this announcement Larry gave a shout that brought the dogs to\r\ntheir feet in surprise. The idea of returning to their comfortable\r\nquarters on the coast instead of struggling on through the\r\nwilderness seemed a vision of perfect happiness to the boy.\r\n\r\nMartin outlined his plan completely while they ate their breakfast.\r\nThey would take the two sleeping bags, the tent, and a supply of\r\nfood, harness the two dogs to one of the sleds and “hit the back\r\ntrail for ‘home,’” as he called the wreck. He would sit on the\r\ntoboggan in one of the sleeping bags and direct the dogs while Larry\r\nwould trudge behind helping to steady the sled and prevent it\r\noverturning in the rough places. In this way they could make the\r\nreturn trip in four days easily unless a storm came up. If a storm\r\ncame they would simply “hole up” and wait until it blew over. When\r\nthe wounded leg had healed, as it would very shortly in their\r\ncomfortable camp, they would make another start for civilization.\r\n\r\nIt took Larry the greater part of the day to make the necessary\r\npreparations for this trip. Under Martin’s direction he rigged one\r\nof the toboggans with handles at the back, so arranged that he could\r\nuse them for steadying the sled or helping the dogs in the hard\r\nplaces as he walked behind. He also made a back-piece of twisted\r\nbranches for Martin to lean against as he sat on the sled,\r\nstrengthening this rough framework with cord and strips of canvas.\r\nWhen finished Martin declared that it looked like a movable brush\r\nheap; but he admitted that it was strong and serviceable, and made a\r\ncomfortable support for his back.\r\n\r\nThe second toboggan and the extra provisions were suspended from\r\nlimbs high above the ground where they would be out of the reach of\r\nanimal prowlers, and available for future use should they ever need\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThey broke camp the next day before dawn and headed the dogs out\r\ninto the open expanse of glistening crust. There was no need to\r\ndirect their course, nor stimulate them to top speed. A trained\r\nsledge dog remembers directions better than a man, and is as keen\r\nfor the return trip toward home as his human companions. Indeed Jack\r\nand Kim showed such enthusiasm and found that their load ran so\r\neasily on the hard crust that Larry had difficulty in keeping up\r\nwith them at times except by clinging to the handles. Crossing the\r\nplain, which consumed so much time on the outward trip, required\r\nonly three hours for the return; and even in the woods that lay\r\nbeyond their progress was almost twice as fast as before.\r\n\r\nDespite Larry’s efforts, however, the sled received severe bumps at\r\ntimes, that made Martin groan with pain. But the old hunter would\r\nnot allow any stops or slackening of speed for so trivial a matter\r\nas his personal discomfort. His dominant idea was to get back “home”\r\nas quickly as possible, and his attitude spurred Larry on to exert\r\nhimself to the limit of endurance. By sundown they had covered a\r\nquarter of the distance to the coast; and in the afternoon of the\r\nfourth day they came tearing into the home camp, the dogs barking\r\nfrantically and Martin and Larry shouting their delight.\r\n\r\nHere they found everything practically as they had left it, so that\r\nthey had only to open the tent flaps, light a fire in front, and sit\r\ndown to rest and enjoy themselves.\r\n\r\nBut it was no part of Martin’s plan to let Larry sit idle during the\r\nlong weeks that lay ahead of them, or to remain inactive himself one\r\nhour longer than his injured leg compelled him to. He knew that\r\nidleness and lack of diversions were bad things for the boy, who\r\nwould very soon feel the strain of their solitary surroundings if\r\nnot kept so fully occupied that the time would pass quickly. He\r\ncould offer few diversions, but he had planned plenty of active\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nHis first move next day, therefore, was to have Larry haul him to a\r\npoint where he could inspect the wreck. He found it frozen in where\r\nthey had left it, and wedged into a huge mass of ice that would hold\r\nit fast until the warm spring weather. So he transferred their\r\nliving quarters temporarily to the after cabin, which Larry made\r\nsnug with a little tinkering. Here, warmed by the galley stove, he\r\ncould give his wound more effective treatment than in the open tent.\r\nMeanwhile he set Larry to work building a hut made from the wood of\r\nthe forward cabin.\r\n\r\nThe task of tearing this cabin to pieces was even greater than that\r\nof actually putting it together again, but Larry set about it with\r\nsaw, axe, and crow-bar. At first he worked alone; but after a few\r\ndays Martin was able to crawl up on deck and superintend things from\r\nhis seat in a sleeping bag, while the dogs acted as interested\r\nspectators. The days were very short now in this far northern\r\nlatitude, and every hour of daylight was devoted to the wrecking\r\nwork, leaving the “housekeeping” work to be done by lamplight. In\r\nthis way the boy was kept so completely occupied, doing and\r\naccomplishing, that there was little time left to dwell upon the\r\nloneliness of their situation. So that, on the whole, the time\r\npassed quickly and pleasantly. This was what Martin had hoped to\r\naccomplish.\r\n\r\nBy the time the house-building material was secured, the old hunter\r\ncould hobble about on extemporized crutches and give directions\r\nabout building the hut, and sometimes assist Larry in steadying the\r\nboards that held the frame in place. And when their new home had\r\nreached a stage that called for finishing touches he was able to\r\nhandle hammer and saw in performing some of the lighter work.\r\n\r\nThe hut was a curious little creation, with round port holes for\r\nwindows and a ship’s cabin door, which gave it the appearance of\r\nhaving been cast up from the sea. It was made of the tight fitting\r\nboards, and rendered doubly wind proof by two thicknesses of canvas\r\nstretched over every part of it and nailed securely. Inside it was\r\nmade attractive with all manner of ornaments taken from the yacht.\r\nThere were two comfortable bunks arranged cabin-fashion one above\r\nthe other at one end, a table and chairs, a case of books, and the\r\nlittle stove from the galley that kept the room warm even in the\r\ncoldest weather. With its complete equipment, even to spring cots\r\nand mattresses, Martin declared it the finest winter home ever owned\r\nby shipwrecked hunters.\r\n\r\nBy Christmas day it was completed even to the smallest detail, and\r\non that day they moved in and formally took possession, deserting\r\nthe yacht forever. This day was made one of special merriment and\r\nrejoicing, for Martin was able to dispense with his cane or crutches\r\nfor the first time, and use his leg in a natural manner without\r\nassistance. It was still weak, but strengthening so rapidly that it\r\npromised soon to be completely restored to power. So, to celebrate\r\nthis combination of happy events, they brought all manner of\r\ndelicacies from the pile of stores, and devoted the first part of\r\nthe day to preparing for a grand feast.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon they harnessed the dogs tandem to the toboggan,\r\nMartin took his place in the “movable brush heap,” and all went for\r\na “joy ride” of several miles through the woods in a great circle\r\nthat brought them back to the cabin about sundown. In several places\r\non this journey they crossed caribou tracks, the sight of which made\r\nMartin’s eyes sparkle, and he predicted great hunting trips before\r\nthe winter was much older.\r\n\r\nIn the evening they had their grand dinner which the dogs attended,\r\nall hands doing full justice to every course. After the feast Martin\r\nand Larry played cards until far past their usual bedtime. Taken all\r\nin all Christmas day proved a very cheerful one in the great\r\nwilderness.\r\n\r\nThe old man had cherished the hope that his leg would heal and gain\r\nstrength so rapidly that they could make another attempt to reach\r\nthe settlements before the winter was over. For he knew that if they\r\ndid not do so they must wait until the unsettled weather of spring\r\nwas over, and the ground dry enough for reasonably easy traveling.\r\nAt that season they would encounter the terrible wood flies and\r\ninsects, far more to be dreaded in certain regions than cold and\r\nsnow. But it would be madness to attempt to make the winter journey\r\nuntil his strength had returned fully, and he soon realized that\r\nthis would not be until well on toward spring. Very soon he was able\r\nto take fairly long snow-shoe tramps, assisted by the dogs and the\r\ntoboggan, but hauling a heavy sled was quite out of the question. So\r\nhe finally resigned himself to spending the winter at the cabin.\r\n\r\nLarry had shown such aptitude in learning the many secrets of\r\nwoodcraft that he determined to make a “land pilot,” as he called it\r\nfacetiously, of him during their exile. As the boy had become\r\nproficient in the use of the rifle, Martin devoted part of the time\r\nto instructions in the art of trapping. They were in the land of the\r\nsilver fox,--the most highly prized skin of all the fur-bearers--and\r\nso they concentrated their efforts to catch some of these wary\r\nanimals. Meanwhile they made constantly lengthening hunting\r\nexcursions after caribou, Larry occupying the position of chief\r\nhunter with the old man playing assistant. But on these hunting\r\ntrips the little gun that Larry had carried at first was left\r\nhanging on its peg in the hut. In its place Larry now carried a\r\nrepeater similar to Martin’s--a heavy weapon, that gave the boy many\r\nan arm ache.\r\n\r\nGame was not very plentiful, however, and it required constant\r\nefforts to keep their larder supplied with fresh meat. But this\r\nscarcity of game gave the old hunter more opportunities for teaching\r\nthe boy all manner of woodland tricks to secure it. Meanwhile he\r\nimparted to his pupil the most important and difficult feature of\r\nwoodcraft--the art of “being at home” in the woods--to know directions\r\ninstinctively, to observe and interpret every sign, and to take care\r\nof himself under all conditions.\r\n\r\nSeveral times, when the injured leg was stronger and his pupil more\r\nadvanced, Martin made practical tests of the boy’s progress. He\r\nwould select a day when snow was falling, harness the dogs to the\r\ntoboggan loaded with tent, sleeping-bags, and provisions, and make a\r\nzigzag journey into the heart of the woods. Here they would pitch\r\ncamp and wait until the storm ceased. By that time their trail would\r\nbe completely obliterated. Then, without any guiding suggestions, he\r\nhad Larry take the lead and pilot them back to the cabin.\r\n\r\nAt first the boy would become confused, and be obliged to call upon\r\nthe old hunter to straighten him out; and sometimes Martin allowed\r\nhim to become completely at fault before he would aid him. But\r\nlittle by little Larry learned to observe and remember\r\ninstinctively, until presently Martin found it impossible to confuse\r\nhim even on long trips.\r\n\r\nHe learned how to interpret the signs of game, also, how to approach\r\nit successfully, and where to expect to find the wood denizens under\r\nthe ever varying conditions. And when they were successful with gun\r\nor traps, Martin taught him how to skin and dress the game, and to\r\ncare for the pelts.\r\n\r\n“We’ll have to leave all these good furs behind us, I know,” the old\r\nman would say; “but we won’t waste them; and perhaps some other\r\nfellow will come along some day and find them. There’s just one pelt\r\nthat we won’t leave, if we get it. That’s the silver fox.”\r\n\r\nBut this silver fox is a wily fellow. He seems to realize the value\r\nof his coat; or at least he knows that it is very valuable to\r\nhimself, and uses his cunning to retain it. Week after week Martin\r\nused his knowledge and Larry’s increasing skill to trap one of these\r\nfine fellows, only to be disappointed on each occasion. They would\r\nfind where Reynard had hovered about their trap, sometimes actually\r\nstepping over it to steal the bait, knowing in some occult manner\r\njust where the fatal jaws were concealed. It was in vain that Martin\r\ncoated the trap with wax to disguise the scent, covering his hands\r\nand feet with the skins of the wild animals in setting or\r\napproaching the trap. Reynard refused to be deceived.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps success made him careless, although it was probably the\r\nfault of the thin covering of wet snow that fell one day late in the\r\nspring. For at last, after Larry had almost given up hope of getting\r\neven a single silver fox skin, the inevitable happened. Poor Reynard\r\nwalked deliberately into a trap that had been set rather carelessly\r\nto catch a marten.\r\n\r\nWhen Larry discovered this long sought prize held securely by one\r\nfoot in the jaws of the trap, he gave a shout of delight at his\r\nunexpected success. The little animal had evidently been caught\r\nseveral hours before, and from the appearance of the ground about\r\nthe trap had struggled fiercely to free itself. But now it seemed\r\nresigned to its fate, and stood crouching, watching Larry’s approach\r\nwithout making any further effort to escape. Even when the boy\r\nraised a heavy stick to despatch the captive, the little animal made\r\nno attempt to evade the blow, acting more like a dog resigned to\r\ntake punishment from its master than a denizen of the wilderness\r\naccustomed to battle for its existence. But its wide, intelligent\r\neyes, seemed to beg mutely for mercy.\r\n\r\nThe actions of the little animal completely unnerved the boy: he\r\ncould not strike the crouching figure. If the fox had struggled\r\nfiercely, or attempted to fight for its life as a mink or marten\r\nalways did, Larry could have despatched it at once; but that\r\nsubmissive attitude completely disarmed him. He could not resist the\r\nmute appeal in those eyes.\r\n\r\nHe lowered the club and turned away, ashamed of his weakness. But\r\nwhen he turned again, determined to overcome his scruples, the eyes\r\nmet his with their mute plea, and again he lowered the club.\r\n\r\nWhat would Martin think of such girlishness? he asked himself. Would\r\nMartin, or any good hunter, hesitate to snatch the prize that he had\r\nbeen struggling for all winter? He was sure they would not, and he\r\ndespised himself for his weak-heartedness.\r\n\r\nThe longer he hesitated the surer he felt that he could not strike.\r\nThen the thought obtruded itself: Who would ever know if he did not\r\nstrike? Who would there be to judge him but his own conscience if he\r\nwere to set the little animal free instead of killing it? The moment\r\nthese thoughts passed through his mind he knew that the fox had won\r\nits freedom. He should have struck at once: now it was too late.\r\n\r\nBut freeing the captive foot from the jaws of the trap without\r\nencountering the animal’s sharp, white teeth was no easy task; for\r\nhe could not expect the fox to interpret his humane action\r\ncorrectly, and stand mutely while he forced down the trap spring. So\r\nit was not until after several fruitless attempts that he succeeded\r\nin placing a heavy limb across the spring, and by bending it down,\r\nallowed the jaws to fall open and release the foot.\r\n\r\nDuring this manipulation the fox made no attempt to struggle, simply\r\ncrouching down and watching the boy with its haunting eyes. And even\r\nwhen the jaws of the trap relaxed it did not bound away as Larry had\r\nexpected, but slipped out of sight stealthily and with no apparent\r\nhaste, not yet fully assured of its unexpected good fortune.\r\n\r\nThe boy watched the animal disappear with mingled emotions of shame\r\nand satisfaction. But when it was out of sight he drew a long\r\nbreath, and went back to camp in a sober mood.\r\n\r\nThat night at supper Martin was unusually talkative. In about a\r\nweek, he said, they should start for home if the fine weather\r\ncontinued, and the thought of it put him in a happy frame of mind.\r\nBut Larry ate his supper in silence, trying to excuse himself for\r\nhis deception, and his “chicken-heartedness” in freeing the fox.\r\n\r\nMartin, who was watching him out of the corners of his eyes,\r\nsuddenly surprised him by stopping in the middle of a story to ask:\r\n\r\n“Larry, what happened out in the woods to-day that you are so\r\nashamed of?”\r\n\r\nThe boy replied evasively at first, but the old hunter shook his\r\nhead incredulously.\r\n\r\n“See here, Martin,” Larry said at last, “what would you do if you\r\nhappened to come along to a marten trap and found a silver fox\r\nthere--not a dead fox, you know, and not one that snarled and snapped\r\nand tried to bite you. But a fox that had fought to get loose until\r\nhe couldn’t fight any more, but just stood there and looked you\r\nstraight in the eye even when you raised a club to kill him, and\r\nseemed to say to you:\r\n\r\n“‘That’s right, take your club and kill me, I can’t get out of your\r\nway now. I’m only a poor little fox, anyway, while you are a big,\r\nbrave boy, with guns and dogs and traps, and you needn’t even come\r\nnear enough so that I can bite you. You have been trying to kill me\r\nall winter, just because some woman will give you a thousand dollars\r\nfor the fur I wear to keep warm in, and now you’ve got your chance\r\nto do it.’--What would you do, Martin, if a fox looked at you and\r\ntalked to you with his eyes like that?”\r\n\r\n“What would I do, Larry?” the old man repeated, looking at the roof\r\nand puffing slowly at his pipe. “Why, I’d say, ‘Martin, here’s your\r\nchance to make a thousand dollars mighty easy. I’ll just hit him a\r\nrap on the head, and take him home and skin him.’ That’s what I’d\r\n_say_, Larry. But what I’d do when I saw the little fellow’s big\r\nbrown eyes asking me to let him go home to his family--what I’d _do_,\r\nprobably, would be to look all around to make sure that no one was\r\nlooking to see what a coward I am in my heart, and then I’d spring\r\nthe trap and turn the little rascal loose.”\r\n\r\nWith a bound Larry was out of his chair.\r\n\r\n“That’s just what I did this afternoon, Martin,” he shouted, dancing\r\njoyfully about the room to relieve his pent-up feelings.\r\n\r\n“And so you sat here all the evening calling yourself a coward,”\r\nsaid Martin, when Larry had subsided, “just because you couldn’t\r\nbear to kill a fox in a trap. How about killing wolves, Larry, and\r\nmoose that are trying to kill you? Cowards don’t act that way, boy.\r\nAnd the bravest men usually have the softest spots in their hearts.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n                     THE EARLY MORNING VISITOR\r\n\r\n\r\nMartin and Larry were roused the next morning at daylight by the\r\ndogs who were barking excitedly in their shed outside. Evidently\r\nsome animal was approaching the hut too close for their approval. So\r\nLarry, hoping for a pot shot from the window, slipped out of bed,\r\ntook down his rifle stealthily, and cautiously opened the port on\r\nthe landward side. Just then he heard voices outside, and the next\r\nmoment some one pounded sharply against the door and turned the\r\nlatch. In the doorway stood Mr. Ware, with half a dozen sailors\r\ncrowding behind him.\r\n\r\nWith a shout Martin was out of his bunk, while Larry, dropping his\r\ngun, collided with the old hunter as they rushed together into Mr.\r\nWare’s outstretched arms, and for five minutes the three were locked\r\ntogether in a tangled embrace dancing about like happy children,\r\neach asking questions which no one answered. Then Larry discovered\r\nthat one of the sailors was an old acquaintance from the crew of the\r\nyacht, and the sailor came in for a similar wild demonstration,\r\nwhile Mr. Ware stood laughing and gasping for breath. And all this\r\ntime the dogs, recognizing that something quite out of the ordinary\r\nwas taking place inside, were adding their voices to the din, and\r\nstruggling madly to get out of their shed.\r\n\r\nFinally Martin disengaged himself and sank into a chair overcome\r\nwith exhaustion and emotion. For the coming of Mr. Ware was like one\r\nrisen from the dead. And then followed a flood of questions and\r\nexplanations.\r\n\r\nMr. Ware and his companions in the boat had escaped quite as\r\nmiraculously as had Martin and Larry, although they had suffered far\r\ngreater hardships in the storm. They had left the shore in their\r\nboat and were making an exploratory trip along the mouth of the\r\ninlets of the bay just before the storm broke that destroyed the\r\nyacht. The fury of the gale drove them helplessly along the coast,\r\nand pitched them about, breaking their oars and tearing loose their\r\nrudder, so that they were completely disabled. Fortunately they had\r\nrounded the point of land that marked the entrance to the bay, so\r\nthat instead of being blown against the rocks they were driven along\r\nparallel to the coast-line for a time, and thus saved from the\r\nbreakers.\r\n\r\nBut they were hurried from this peril into another quite as great,\r\nas the boat was in danger of swamping at any moment in the waves.\r\nFor now the wind shifted and blew them steadily out to sea, as they\r\nwere without means of controlling or steadying the boat, which\r\nfilled with water continually, and was only kept afloat by ceaseless\r\nbailing with the pots and pans of their cooking outfit.\r\n\r\nAll that night they worked, buffeted by the gale, with no idea where\r\nthey might be drifting. But when morning came and the gale subsided\r\nthere was no land in sight. That made little difference to them, as\r\nwithout oars or sails they could not have reached it in any event.\r\nFortunately the boat was supplied with a box of sea biscuit and a\r\nkeg of water--a precaution against emergencies always taken by Mr.\r\nWare in manning his boats. So that while they were almost frozen,\r\nthey were not hungry or thirsty during the six days and nights of\r\ntheir aimless drifting. But their days seemed numbered, as they had\r\nlittle hope of being picked up so late in the season.\r\n\r\nImagine their delight, therefore, when on the seventh morning they\r\ndiscovered a three master heading almost directly for them. The\r\ncaptain of the vessel had seen them, and changed his course to pick\r\nthem up.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he was safely on board Mr. Ware made tempting offers to\r\nthe captain to turn about and attempt to find the yacht. But his\r\nefforts were unsuccessful. The schooner was far out of her course\r\nand must make the best time possible to her English port, and no\r\noffer could tempt the captain to turn back. Moreover, as he pointed\r\nout, it would do little good to return if the yacht was lost;\r\nwhereas if she were safe, she would make her way back to New York\r\nand would be waiting for Mr. Ware on his return.\r\n\r\nSo he was forced to curb his impatience for three long weeks while\r\nthe schooner floundered her way across the ocean, and two weeks more\r\nbefore he reached his home. By that time winter had set in and it\r\nwould be madness to attempt to approach the frozen Labrador coast at\r\nthat time, even if he had hoped to find any of his party alive.\r\n\r\nBut he laid his plans for an early start in the spring, and the\r\nmoment he could do so with reasonable safety he secured a staunch\r\nlittle steamer and started on his search. They had arrived near the\r\nentrance of the little bay the night before, but it grew dark before\r\nthey rounded the point where they could make observations. Shortly\r\nafter this the man in the lookout reported what he believed to be a\r\nlight up among the rocks on shore. It was so faint that it could\r\nbarely be made out through the glasses; and presently it\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nThis discovery kept Mr. Ware awake all night; and as soon as it was\r\nnear daylight, he had come off in a life-boat to investigate,\r\nleaving the steamer to follow cautiously by daylight. Imagine his\r\ndelight, then, at finding the snug little hut, with Martin and Larry\r\nsafe inside.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Ware had finished his recital Martin told him in detail the\r\nexperiences that he and Larry had had during the winter; of their\r\nstart for home, the blizzard, his encounter with the moose, and\r\ntheir final return to the coast and the comfortable time spent in\r\nthe little hut.\r\n\r\n“And you got here just in the nick of time, Mr. Ware,” he commented.\r\n“In another week we should have been footing it cross-country for\r\nhome; and no knowing where we should have landed.”\r\n\r\nWhile they had been talking the little steamer had come into the bay\r\nand dropped anchor half a mile off shore ready to receive her\r\npassengers. The captain, anxious to be away from the dangerous\r\nlocality as quickly as possible, kept signalling repeatedly with\r\nshort blasts of the whistle, and at last Mr. Ware decided that it\r\nwas time for all hands to be off. But the snug little hut, tucked\r\naway up under the rock among the spruces, appealed strongly to his\r\nfancy; and Martin and Larry actually seemed reluctant to leave it\r\nnow that their long-looked-for chance to do so had come. They had\r\nspent many happy hours in their tight little room, and it seemed\r\nlike treachery to an old friend to turn their backs upon it forever.\r\nThe old hunter said nothing of his thoughts on this score, however,\r\nand set about gathering together the articles he was to take away.\r\nBut Larry, with a lump rising in his throat, found it difficult to\r\nrepress his feelings.\r\n\r\n“I wish it could go with us,” he said, stopping in his work to take\r\na wistful look at the many familiar objects they were leaving. “It\r\nwill be pretty lonesome for the little house standing up here all\r\nalone year after year and never seeing any of us again.” And the boy\r\nleaned over his work again to hide his emotions.\r\n\r\n“We’re not going to desert it for good, Larry,” said Mr. Ware,\r\npatting the boy on the head kindly. “This is the best little\r\nshooting lodge I know of. So every year we will come up here for a\r\nhunt, and Martin will take us to the best hunting places, and keep\r\nus out of mischief generally, as he always does. What do you say,\r\nMartin?”\r\n\r\nBut the old hunter shook his head.\r\n\r\n“I’ll be mighty glad to come every year, Mr. Ware,” he said\r\nlaughing; “but I leave the hunting and guiding to a younger fellow\r\nwho can do it just as well, or better. That’s the ‘younger fellow’ I\r\nmean, right here,” and he pointed to Larry. “He knows the country as\r\nwell as I do, and he can follow a trail, shoot a rifle, and run a\r\ncamp with the best of them. And if you ever get into a tight place\r\nout there in the woods, he’ll steer you out of it safely every time.\r\nFor he’s learned his trade up here this winter. He’s a regular\r\nforest pilot now--a real woodsman, sure enough.”\r\n\r\n                              THE END.",
