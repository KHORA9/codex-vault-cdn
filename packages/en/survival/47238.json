INTRODUCTORY.\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to name any subject of investigation, the\r\nprogress of which during our time has been more remarkable than that in\r\nthe field of stellar astronomy. Several features of this progress are\r\nespecially noteworthy. One of these is the mere extension of research.\r\nA natural result of the northern hemisphere being the home of civilized\r\npeoples was that, thirty years ago, the study of the southern heavens\r\nhad been comparatively neglected. It is true that the curiosity of\r\nthe inquiring astronomers of the past would not be satisfied without\r\ntheir knowing something of what was to be seen south of the equator.\r\nVarious enterprises and establishments had therefore contributed to\r\nour knowledge of the region in question. As far back as 1667, during\r\na voyage to St. Helena, Halley catalogued the brighter stars in the\r\nregion near the South Pole. About 1750 Lacaille, of France, established\r\nan observing station at the Cape of Good Hope, and made a catalogue\r\nof several thousand stars which has remained a handy book for the\r\nastronomer up to the present time. In 1834-38 Sir John Herschel made a\r\nspecial voyage to the Cape of Good Hope, armed with the best telescopes\r\nwhich the genius of his father had shown him how to construct, for\r\nthe purpose of doing for the southern heavens as much as possible of\r\nwhat his father had done for the northern. The work of this expedition\r\nforms one of the most important and interesting chapters in the history\r\nof astronomic science. Not only is Herschel’s magnificent volume a\r\nclassic of astronomy, but the observations which it contains are still\r\nas carefully and profitably studied as any that have since been made.\r\nThey may be said to form the basis of our present knowledge of the\r\nregion which they included in their scope.\r\n\r\nHerschel’s work may be described as principally in the nature of\r\nan exploration. He had no instruments for accurately determining\r\nthe positions of stars. In the latter field the first important\r\ncontributions after Lacaille were made by Sir Thomas Brisbane, Governor\r\nof New South Wales, and Rumker, his assistant, at Paramata. Johnson, of\r\nEngland, about 1830, introduced modern accuracy into the construction\r\nof a rather limited catalogue of stars which he observed at St.\r\nHelena. About the same time the British Government established the\r\nobservatory at the Cape of Good Hope, which has maintained its activity\r\nto the present time, though, at first, its means were extremely\r\nlimited. About the middle of the century the Government of New South\r\nWales established, first at Williamstown and then at Melbourne, an\r\nobservatory which has worked in the same field with marked success.\r\n\r\nAn American enterprise in the same direction was that of Captain James\r\nM. Gilliss, who, in 1849, organized an astronomical expedition to\r\nChili. The principal motive of this enterprise was the determining of\r\nthe solar parallax by observations upon Venus and Mars near the time\r\nof their nearest approach to the earth. As these observations would\r\ntake but a small part of his time, Gilliss determined to take with him\r\ninstruments for determining the positions of the stars. He established\r\nhis observatory at a point near Santiago, where he continued his\r\nobservations for nearly three years. He was a practical observer,\r\nbut an untoward circumstance detracted from the value of his work.\r\nHis observatory was built upon a rocky eminence, a foundation which\r\nseemed to afford the best possible guarantee of the stability of his\r\ninstruments. He made no attempt to reduce his observations till after\r\nhis return home. Then it was found that the foundation, through the\r\nexpansion and contraction due to the heat of the sun, was subject to a\r\ndiurnal change which made it extremely difficult to derive good results\r\nfrom his careful work. It was not until 1896, more than thirty years\r\nafter his death, that the catalogue of the stars observed by him was at\r\nlast completed and published.\r\n\r\nWe do not derogate in any way from the merit of these efforts in saying\r\nthat they could not lead to results comparable with those of the score\r\nof richly equipped northern observatories which the leading nations\r\nand universities of Europe had endowed and supported for more than a\r\nhundred years. Only within the last thirty years has it been possible\r\nto bring our knowledge of the southern heavens up to a satisfactory\r\nstage. Now, however, the progress of southern astronomy, if we may use\r\nthe term, is such that in several points our knowledge of the southern\r\nheavens surpasses that of the northern ones. If we measure institutions\r\nby the importance of the work they are doing, there are several in the\r\nsouthern hemisphere which must to-day be placed in the first rank.\r\n\r\nThe history and work of the Cordova Observatory are of special\r\ninterest. In 1870 Dr. B. A. Gould, who might fairly be considered\r\nas the father of modern American astronomy, conceived the idea of\r\nestablishing an observatory of the first class in South America. He\r\nfound the President and Governor of the Argentine Republic ready to\r\nsupport his scheme with a liberality well fitted to impress us with\r\na high sense of their standard of civilization. In a year or two the\r\nobservatory at Cordova was in active operation. A statement of its work\r\nbelongs to a subsequent chapter. Suffice it to remark here that Dr.\r\nGould continued in active charge until 1885, when he returned home, and\r\nwas succeeded by Thome, the present director.\r\n\r\nA few years after Gould went to Cordova, Gill was made director of the\r\nRoyal Observatory at the Cape of Good Hope. The rapid growth of this\r\ninstitution to one of the first rank is due no less to the scientific\r\nability of the new director than to the unflagging energy which he has\r\ndevoted to the enlargement of the resources of the institution. The\r\ngreat fact which he sought to impress upon his supporters was that\r\nthe southern celestial hemisphere was as large as the northern, and\r\ntherefore equally worthy of study.\r\n\r\nIn any general review of the progress of stellar astronomy during the\r\npast twenty years, we should find Harvard University before us at every\r\nturn. What it has done will be seen, perhaps in an imperfect way, in\r\nsubsequent chapters. Not satisfied with the northern hemisphere, it\r\nhas established a branch at Arequipa, Peru, in which its methods of\r\nobservation and research are extended to the south celestial pole.\r\nIts principal specialties have been the continuous exploration of the\r\nheavens. Celestial photography, photometry and spectroscopy sum up its\r\nfields of activity. For more than ten years it might be almost said\r\nthat a sleepless watch of the heavens has been kept up by an all-seeing\r\nphotographic eye, with an accuracy of which the world has hardly had\r\na conception. The completeness with which its work has been done has\r\nrecently been shown in a striking way. Our readers are doubtless\r\nacquainted with the singular character of the minor planet Eros, whose\r\norbit passes through that of Mars, as one link of a chain passes\r\nthrough another, and which comes nearer the earth at certain times than\r\nany other celestial body, the moon excepted. When the character of\r\nthe orbit became established, it was of interest to know whether the\r\nplanet had ever been observed as a fixed star at former oppositions.\r\nChandler, having computed the path of the planet at the most important\r\nof the oppositions, beginning with 1892-94, communicated his results to\r\nDirector Pickering, and suggested a search of the Harvard photographs\r\nto see if the planet could be found on them. The result was the\r\ndiscovery of the planet upon more than a score of plates taken at\r\nvarious times during the preceding ten years. New stars were formerly\r\nsupposed to be of very rare occurrence, but since the Harvard system of\r\nphotographing the heavens has been introduced, no less than three have\r\nbeen known to break out.\r\n\r\nThe great revelations of our times have come through the application\r\nof the spectroscope to the measurement of motions in the line of sight\r\nfrom us to a star. No achievement of the intellect of man would have\r\nseemed farther without the range of possibility to the thinker of half\r\na century ago, than the discoveries of invisible bodies which are now\r\nbeing made with this instrument. The revelations of the telescope\r\ntake us by surprise. But, if we consider what the thinker alluded to\r\nmight regard as attainable, they are far surpassed by those of the\r\nspectroscope. The dark bodies, planets, we may call them, which are\r\nrevolving round the stars, must be forever invisible in any telescope\r\nthat it would be possible to construct. They would remain invisible if\r\nthe power of the instrument were increased ten thousand times. And yet,\r\nif there are inhabitants on these planets, our astronomers could tell\r\nthem more of the motions of the world on which they live than the human\r\nrace knew of the motions of the earth before the time of Copernicus.\r\n\r\nThe men and institutions which have contributed to this result are\r\nso few in number that it will not be tedious to mention at least the\r\nprincipal actors. The possibility of measuring the motions of the stars\r\nin the line of sight by means of the spectroscope was first pointed\r\nout by Mr. now Sir William Huggins. He actually put the method into\r\noperation. As soon as its feasibility was demonstrated it was taken up\r\nat Greenwich. In these earlier attempts, eye methods alone were used,\r\nand the results were not always reliable. Then spectrum photography\r\nwas applied at the astrophysical observatory at Potsdam by Vogel.\r\nThence the photographic method soon spread to Meudon and Pulkova.\r\nBut, as often happens when new fields of research are opened, we find\r\nthem ablaze in quarters where we should least expect. The successful\r\napplication of the method requires not only the best spectroscope, but\r\nthe most powerful telescope at command. Ten years ago the most powerful\r\ntelescope in the world was at the Lick Observatory. Mr. D. O. Mills put\r\nat its eye end the best spectrograph that human art could make at that\r\ntime, the work of Brashear. It is Campbell, who, with this instrument,\r\nhas inaugurated a series of discoveries in the line in question which\r\nare without a parallel.\r\n\r\nA mere survey of what has been done in the various lines we have\r\nmentioned would be far from giving an idea of the real significance of\r\nthe advance we are considering. Cataloguing the stars, estimating their\r\nmagnitudes, recording and comparing their spectra and determining\r\ntheir motions, might be considered as, after all, barren of results\r\nof the highest human interest. When we know the exact position of\r\nevery star in the heavens, the direction in which it is moving and the\r\ncharacter of its spectral lines, how much wiser are we?\r\n\r\nWhat could hardly have been foreseen fifty years ago, is that these\r\nvarious classes of results are now made to combine and converge upon\r\nthe greatest problem which the mind of man has ever attempted to\r\ngrasp--that of the structure of the universe. The study of variable\r\nstars has suddenly fallen into line, so to speak, so that now, it is\r\nuniting itself to the study of all the other subjects to give us at\r\nleast a faint conception of what the solution of this problem may be.\r\n\r\nOne of the principal objects of the present chapter is to make\r\na comparison of these various researches, and discuss the views\r\nrespecting the constitution of the stars individually, as well as of\r\nthe universe as a whole, to which they lead us. But there are a number\r\nof details to be considered singly before we can combine results in\r\nthis way. Our early chapters will therefore be devoted to the special\r\nfeatures and individual problems of stellar astronomy which have\r\noccupied the minds of astronomers from the beginning of their work to\r\nthe present time. Keeping these details in mind, we can profitably\r\nproceed to the consideration of the general conclusions to be drawn\r\nfrom them.\r\n\r\nWe may begin by refreshing our memories on some points, an\r\nunderstanding of which must be taken for granted. What are familiarly\r\nknown as the heavenly bodies belong to two classes. Those nearest to us\r\nform a sort of colony far removed from all the others, called the solar\r\nsystem. The principal bodies of this system are the sun and eight great\r\nplanets with their moons, revolving round it. On one of the planets,\r\nsmall when compared with the great bodies of the universe, but large to\r\nour every-day conceptions, we dwell. The other planets appear to us as\r\nstars. Four of them, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn, are distinguished\r\nfrom the fixed stars by their superior brightness and characteristic\r\nmotions. Of the remaining three, Mercury will only rarely excite\r\nnotice, while Uranus and Neptune are as good as invisible to the naked\r\neye.\r\n\r\nThe dimensions of the solar system are vast when compared with any\r\nterrestrial standard. A cannon shot going incessantly at its utmost\r\nspeed would be a thousand years in crossing the orbit of Neptune\r\nfrom side to side. But vast as the dimensions are, they sink into\r\ninsignificance when compared with the distance of the stars. Outside\r\nthe solar system are spaces which, so far as we know, are absolutely\r\nvoid, save here and there a comet or a meteor, until we look far\r\noutside the region which a cannon shot would cross in a million of\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nThe nearest star is thousands of times farther away than the most\r\ndistant planet. Scattered at these inconceivable distances are the\r\nbodies to which our attention is directed in the present work. If we\r\nare asked what they are, we may reply that the stars are suns. But we\r\nmight equally well say that the sun is one of the stars; a small star,\r\nindeed, surrounded by countless others, many of which are much larger\r\nand brighter than itself. We shall treat our theme as far as possible\r\nby what we may call the natural method, beginning with what, being most\r\nobvious to the eye, was first noticed by man, or will be first noticed\r\nby an observer, and tracing knowledge up step by step to its present\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nSeveral features of the universe of stars will be evident at a glance.\r\nOne of these is the diversity of the apparent brightness, or, in\r\ntechnical language, of the magnitudes of the stars. A few far outshine\r\nthe great mass of their companions. A greater number are of what we may\r\ncall medium brightness; there is a yet larger number of fainter ones,\r\nand about one half of all those seen by a keen eye under favorable\r\nconditions are so near the limit of visibility as to escape ordinary\r\nnotice. Moreover, those which we see are but an insignificant fraction\r\nof the number revealed by the telescope. The more we increase our\r\noptical power, the greater the number that come into view. How many\r\nmillions may exist in the heavens it is scarcely possible even to\r\nguess. The photographic maps of the heavens now being made probably\r\nshow fifty millions, perhaps one hundred millions or more.\r\n\r\nAnother evident feature is the tendency of the brighter stars to\r\ncluster into groups, known as constellations. The latter are extremely\r\nirregular, so that it is impossible to decide where one constellation\r\nshould end and another begin, or to which constellation a certain star\r\nmay belong. Hence, we can neither define the constellations nor say\r\nwhat is their number, and the division of the stars among them is a\r\nsomewhat arbitrary proceeding.\r\n\r\nA third feature is the Milky Way or Galaxy, which, to ordinary vision,\r\nappears as an irregular succession of cloud-like forms spanning the\r\nheavens. We now know that these seeming clouds are really congeries of\r\nstars too small to be individually visible to the naked eye. We shall\r\nhereafter see that the stars of the Galaxy form, so to speak, the base\r\non which the universe appears to be constructed. Each of these three\r\nfeatures will be considered in its proper place.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. MAGNITUDES OF THE STARS.\r\n\r\nThe apparent brightness of a star, as we see it from the earth, depends\r\nupon two causes--its intrinsic brilliancy or the quantity of light\r\nwhich it actually emits, and its distance from us. It follows that if\r\nall the stars were of equal intrinsic brightness we could determine\r\ntheir relative distances by measuring the respective amounts of light\r\nwhich we receive from them. The quantity of light in such a case varies\r\ninversely as the square of the distance. This will be made evident\r\nby Fig. 1, where S represents the position of a star, regarded as a\r\nluminous point, while A and B are screens placed at such a distance\r\nthat each will receive the same amount of light from the star. If the\r\nscreen B is twice as far as the screen A, its sides must be twice\r\nas large as those of A in order that it shall receive all the light\r\nthat would fall on A. In this case its surface will be four times the\r\nsurface of A. It is then evident that any small portion of the surface\r\nof B will receive one fourth as much light as an equal portion of\r\nsurface A. Thus an eye or a telescope in the position B will receive\r\nfrom the star one fourth as much light as in the position A, and the\r\nstar will seem one fourth as bright.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 1.]\r\n\r\nThe fact is, however, that the stars are very unequal in their actual\r\nbrightness, and in consequence the apparent magnitude of a star gives\r\nus no clue to its distance. Among the nearer of the stars are some\r\nscarcely, if at all, visible to the naked eye, while among the brighter\r\nones are several whose distances are immeasurably great. A remarkable\r\nexample is that of Caropes, the second brightest star in the heavens.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons astronomers are obliged to content themselves, in the\r\nfirst place, with determinations of the actual amount of light that the\r\nvarious stars send to us, or their apparent brilliancy, without regard\r\nto their distance or actual brilliancy. The ancient astronomers divided\r\nall the stars they could see into six classes, the number expressing\r\nthe apparent brightness being called the magnitude of the star. The\r\nbrightest ones, numbering in all about fourteen, were said to be of\r\nthe first magnitude. The fifty next in brightness were said to be of\r\nthe second magnitude. Three times as many, an order fainter, were of\r\nthe third magnitude. The progression was continued up to the sixth\r\nmagnitude, which included those which were barely visible.\r\n\r\nAs the stars are actually of every degree of apparent brilliancy, no\r\nsharp line of demarkation could be drawn between those of one magnitude\r\nand those of the magnitude next higher. Hence, different observers\r\nmade different estimates, some calling a star of the second magnitude\r\nwhich others would call of the first, while others would designate a\r\nstar of the third magnitude which others would call of the second. It\r\nis therefore impossible to state with absolute numerical precision what\r\nnumber of stars should be regarded of one magnitude and what of another.\r\n\r\nAn idea of the magnitude of a star can be readily gained by the casual\r\nobserver. Looking at the heavens on almost any cloudless evening, we\r\nmay assume that the two, three or more brightest stars which we see are\r\nof the first magnitude. As examples of those of the second magnitude,\r\nmay be taken the five brightest stars of the Dipper, the Pole Star and\r\nthe brighter stars of Cassiopeia. Some or all of these objects can\r\nbe seen on any clear night of the year in our latitude. Stars of the\r\nthird magnitude are so numerous that it is difficult to select any one\r\nfor comparison. The brightest star of the Pleiades is really of this\r\nmagnitude, but it does not appear so in consequence of the five other\r\nstars by which it is surrounded. At a distance of 15° from the Pole\r\nStar, Beta Ursa Minoris is always visible, and may be distinguished by\r\nbeing slightly redder than the Pole Star; it lies between two fainter\r\nstars, the brighter of which is of the third and the other of the\r\nfourth magnitude. The five readily visible but fainter stars of the\r\nPleiades are about of the fourth magnitude. Of the fifth magnitude are\r\nthe faintest stars which are easily visible to the naked eye, while the\r\nsixth comprises those which are barely visible with good eyes.\r\n\r\nModern astronomers, while adhering to the general system which has\r\ncome down to them from ancient times, have sought to give it greater\r\ndefiniteness. Careful study showed that the actual amount of light\r\ncorresponding to the different magnitudes varied nearly in geometrical\r\nprogression from one magnitude to another, a conclusion which accords\r\nwith the well-known psychological law that the intensity of sensation\r\nvaries by equal amounts when the exciting cause varies in geometrical\r\nprogression. It was found that an average star of the fifth magnitude\r\ngave between two and three times as much light as an average one of\r\nthe sixth; one of the fourth gave between two and three times as much\r\nlight as one of the fifth; and so on to the second. In the case of\r\nthe first magnitude, the diversity is so great that it is scarcely\r\npossible to fix an average ratio. Sirius, for example, is really six\r\ntimes as bright as Altair, which is commonly taken as a standard for\r\na first magnitude star. To give precision to their estimates, modern\r\nastronomers are gradually seeking to lay the subject of magnitudes on\r\nan exact basis by defining a change of one unit in the magnitude as\r\ncorresponding to an increase of about two and one half times in the\r\namount of light.\r\n\r\nIf the practice of separating the visible stars into only six orders\r\nof magnitude were continued without change, we should still have\r\nthe anomaly of including in one class stars of markedly different\r\ndegrees of brightness. Some more than twice as bright as others would\r\nbe designated of the same magnitude. Hence, to give quantitative\r\nexactness to the results, a magnitude is regarded as a quantity which\r\nmay have any value whatever, and may be expressed by decimals--tenths\r\nor even hundredths. Thus, we may have stars of magnitude 5.0, 5.1,\r\n5.2, etc., or we may even subdivide yet farther and speak of stars\r\nhaving magnitudes 5.11, 5.12, etc. Unfortunately, however, there\r\nis as yet no way known of determining the amount of light received\r\nfrom a star except by an estimate of its effect upon the eye. Two\r\nstars are regarded as equal when they appear to the eye of equal\r\nbrilliancy. In such a case the judgment is very uncertain. Hence,\r\nobservers have endeavored to give greater precision to it by the use\r\nof photometers,--instruments for measuring quantities of light. But\r\neven with this instrument the observer must depend upon an estimated\r\nequality of light as judged by the eye. The light from one star is\r\nincreased or diminished in a known proportion until it appears equal to\r\nthat of another star, which may be an artificial one produced by the\r\nflame of a candle. The proportion of increase or diminution shows the\r\ndifference of magnitude between the two stars.\r\n\r\nAs we proceed to place the subject of photometric measures of star\r\nlight on this precise basis we find the problem to be a complex one.\r\nIn the first place not all the rays which come from a star are visible\r\nto our eyes as light. But all the radiance, visible or invisible,\r\nmay be absorbed by a dark surface, and will then show its effect by\r\nheating that surface. The most perfect measure of the radiance of a\r\nstar would therefore be the amount of heat which it conveys, because\r\nthis expresses what is going on in the body better than the amount of\r\nvisible light can do. But unfortunately the heating effect of the rays\r\nfrom a star is far below what can be measured or even indicated by any\r\nknown instrument. We are therefore obliged to abandon any thought of\r\ndetermining the total amount of radiation and confine ourselves to that\r\nportion which we call light.\r\n\r\nHere, when we aim at precision, we find that light, as we understand\r\nit, is properly measured only by its effect on the optic nerve, and\r\nthere is no way of measuring this effect except by estimation. Thus,\r\nall the photometer can do is to give us the means of increasing or\r\ndiminishing the light from one star, so that we can make it equal by\r\nestimation to that from some other star or source of light.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of reaching strict results in this way is increased by\r\nthe fact that stars are different in color. Two lights can be estimated\r\nas equal with greater precision when they are of the same color than\r\nwhen their colors are different. An additional source of uncertainty\r\nis brought in by what is known as the Purkinje phenomenon, after the\r\nphysicist who first observed it. He found that if we took two lights of\r\nequal apparent brightness, the one red and the other green, and then\r\nincreased or diminished them in the same proportion, they would no\r\nlonger appear equal. In other words, the geometrical axiom that halves\r\nor quarters of equal quantities are themselves equal, does not apply to\r\nthe effect of light on the eye. If we diminish the two equal lights,\r\nwe find that the green will look brighter than the red. If we increase\r\nthem in the same proportion, the red will look brighter than the green.\r\nIn other words, the red light will, to our vision, increase or fade\r\naway more rapidly with a given amount of change than the green light\r\nwill.\r\n\r\nIt is found in recent times that this law of change does not extend\r\nprogressively through all spectral colors. It is true that as we pass\r\nfrom the red to the violet end of the spectrum the yellow fades away\r\nless rapidly with a given diminution than does the red, and the green\r\nstill less rapidly than the yellow. But when we pass from the green to\r\nthe blue, it is said that the latter does not fade out quite so fast as\r\nthe green.\r\n\r\nOne obvious conclusion from all this is that two stars of different\r\ncolors which look equal to the naked eye will not look equal in the\r\ntelescope. The red or yellow star will look relatively brighter in a\r\ntelescope; the green or bluish one relatively brighter to the naked eye.\r\n\r\nIn recent times stars have been photographed on a large scale. Their\r\nmagnitudes can then be determined by the effect of the light on\r\nthe photographic plate, the impression of the star, as seen in a\r\nmicroscope, being larger and more intense as the star is brighter.\r\nBut the magnitude thus determined is not proportional to the apparent\r\nbrightness as seen by the eye, because the photographic effect of\r\nblue light is much greater than that of red light having the same\r\napparent brightness. In fact, the difference is so great that, with\r\nthe chemicals formerly used, red light was almost without photographic\r\neffect. Even now, what we measure in taking the photograph of a star\r\nis almost entirely the light in the more refrangible portions of the\r\nspectrum. It appears, therefore, that when a blue and a yellow star,\r\nequally bright to the naked eye, are photographed, the impression made\r\non the negative by the blue star will be greater than that made by the\r\nyellow one. A distinction is therefore recognized between photographic\r\nand visual magnitudes.\r\n\r\nThe photographic magnitudes of the stars are now being investigated and\r\ncatalogued on a scale even larger than that on which we have studied\r\nthe visual magnitudes. Yet we have to admit the non-correspondence\r\nof the two systems. The bluer the star, the brighter will be its\r\nphotographic as compared with its visual magnitude. The most that can\r\nbe done is to bring about the best attainable agreement between the two\r\nsystems in the general average of all the stars.\r\n\r\nFortunately the differences between the colors of the stars are by\r\nno means so great as those between the colors of natural objects\r\naround us. All the stars radiate light of all colors; and although the\r\ndifference is quite appreciable either by the eye or by the photograph,\r\nit is not so great as it would have been were the variations in color\r\nas wide as in the case of terrestrial objects.\r\n\r\nTwo comprehensive surveys of the heavens, intended to determine as\r\naccurately as possible the magnitudes of all the brighter stars, have\r\nrecently been undertaken. One of these is the Harvard photometry,\r\ncommenced by Professor Pickering at the Harvard Observatory, and\r\nnow extended to the Southern Hemisphere by the aid of a branch\r\nestablishment at Arequipa, Peru.\r\n\r\nThe instrument designed by Professor Pickering for his purpose is\r\ntermed a meridian photometer, and is so arranged that the observer\r\ncan see in the field of his telescope a reflected image of the Pole\r\nStar, and, at the same time, the image of some other star while it is\r\npassing the meridian. By a polarizing apparatus the image of the star\r\nto be measured is made to appear of equal brightness with that of the\r\nPole Star, and the position of a Nicol prism, which brings out this\r\nequality, shows the ratio between the magnitudes of the two stars.\r\n\r\nThe other survey, with the same object, is now being made at the\r\nPotsdam Astrophysical Observatory, near Berlin. In the photometer\r\nused by the German astronomers the image of one star is compared\r\nwith an artificial star formed by the flame of a candle. The work is\r\nperformed in a more elaborate way than at the Harvard Observatory,\r\nand in consequence, only that part of the heavens, extending from the\r\nequator to 40° north declination, has been completed and published.\r\nA comparison of the results thus obtained with those of Professor\r\nPickering, shows a curious difference depending on the color of the\r\nstar. In the case of the reddest stars, the estimates are found to be\r\nin fairly close agreement, Pickering’s being a little the fainter.\r\nBut in the case of the white or bluish stars, the estimates of the\r\nGerman astronomers are more than one fourth of a magnitude greater\r\nthan those of Pickering. This corresponds to an increase of nearly one\r\nfifth in the brightness. Whether this difference is to be regarded as\r\npurely psychological or due to the instruments used, is an interesting\r\nquestion which has not yet been settled. It is difficult to conceive\r\nhow different instruments should give results so different. On the\r\nother hand, the comparisons made by the Germans make it difficult to\r\naccept the view that the difference is due purely to the personality\r\nof the observers. There are two German observers, Drs. Müller and\r\nKempf, whose results agree with each other exactly. On the other hand,\r\nPritchard, at Oxford, made quite an extensive photometric survey,\r\nusing an instrument by which the light of one star was cut down by\r\na wedge-shaped dark glass, whereby any gradation of light could be\r\nproduced. A comparison shows that the results of Pritchard agree\r\nsubstantially with those of Pickering. It is quite possible that the\r\nPurkinje phenomenon may be the cause of the difference, the source of\r\nwhich is eminently worthy of investigation.\r\n\r\nThis fact simply emphasizes the lack of mathematical precision in\r\nphotometric measurements of star light. Even apart from this difference\r\nof color, the estimates of two observers will frequently differ by 0.2\r\nand sometimes by even 0.3 of a magnitude. These differences correspond\r\nroughly to 20 or 30 per cent in the amount of light.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed from this that such estimates are of no value\r\nfor scientific purposes. Very important conclusions, based on great\r\nnumbers of stars, may be drawn even from these uncertain quantities.\r\nYet, it can hardly be doubted that if the light of a star could be\r\nmeasured from time to time to its thousandth part, conclusions of yet\r\ngreater value and interest might be drawn from the measures.\r\n\r\nWe have said that in our modern system the aim has been to so designate\r\nthe magnitudes of the stars that a series of magnitudes in arithmetical\r\nprogression shall correspond to quantities of light ranging in\r\ngeometrical progression. We have also said that a change of one unit\r\nof magnitude corresponds to a multiplication or division of the light\r\nby about 2.5. On any scale of magnitude this factor of multiplication\r\nconstitutes the light-ratio of the scale. In recent times, after much\r\ndiscussion of the subject and many comparisons of photometric measures\r\nwith estimates made in the old-fashioned way, there is a general\r\nagreement among observers to fix the light ratio at the number whose\r\nlogarithm is 0.4. This is such that an increase of five units in the\r\nnumber expressing the magnitude corresponds to a division of the light\r\nby 100. If, for example, we take a standard star of magnitude one and\r\nanother of magnitude six, the first would be 100 times as bright as the\r\nsecond. This corresponds to a light ratio slightly greater than 2.5.\r\n\r\nWhen this scale is adopted, the series of magnitudes may extend\r\nindefinitely in both directions so that to every apparent brightness\r\nthere will be a certain magnitude. For example, if we assign the\r\nmagnitude 1.0 to a certain star, taken as a standard, which would\r\nformerly have been called a star of the first magnitude, then a star a\r\nlittle more than 2.5 times as bright would be of magnitude one less in\r\nnumber, that is, of magnitude 0. The one next brighter in the series\r\nwould be of magnitude -1. So great is the diversity in the brightness\r\nof the stars formerly called of the first magnitude that Sirius is\r\nstill brighter than the imaginary star just mentioned, the number\r\nexpressing its magnitude being -1.4.\r\n\r\nThis suggests what we may regard as one of the capital questions in\r\ncelestial photometry. There being no limit to the extent of the scale,\r\nwhat would be the stellar magnitude of the sun as we see it when\r\nexpressed this way on the photometric scale? Such a number is readily\r\nderivable when we know the ratio between the light of the sun and that\r\nof a star of known magnitude. Many attempts have been made by observers\r\nto obtain this ratio; but the problem is one of great difficulty, and\r\nthe results have been extremely discordant. Amongst them there are\r\nthree which seem less liable to error than others; those of Wollaston,\r\nBond and Zöllner. Their results for the stellar magnitude of the sun\r\nare as follow:\r\n\r\n  Wollaston      -26.6\r\n  Bond           -25.8\r\n  Zöllner        -26.6\r\n\r\nOf these, Zöllner’s seems to be the best, and may, therefore, in taking\r\nthe mean, be entitled to double weight. The result will then be:\r\n\r\n  Stellar magnitude of sun       -26.4\r\n\r\nFrom this number may be readily computed the ratio of sunlight to that\r\nof a star of any given magnitude. We thus find:\r\n\r\nThe sun gives us:\r\n\r\n     10,000,000,000, the light of Sirius.\r\n     91,000,000,000, the light of a star of magnitude 1.\r\n  9,100,000,000,000, the light of one of magnitude 6.\r\n\r\nThe square roots of these numbers show the number of times we should\r\nincrease the actual distance of the sun in order that it might shine\r\nas a star of the corresponding magnitude. These numbers and the\r\ncorresponding parallax are as follows:\r\n\r\n  Sirius; Distance =   100,000: Parallax = 2″.06\r\n  Mag. 1     ”         302,000:    ”       0″.68\r\n   ”   2     ”         479,000:    ”       0″.43\r\n   ”   3     ”         759,000:    ”       0″.27\r\n   ”   4     ”       1,202,000:    ”       0″.17\r\n   ”   5     ”       1,906,000:    ”       0″.11\r\n   ”   6     ”       3,020,000:    ”       0″.07\r\n\r\nThese parallaxes are those that the sun would have if placed at such a\r\ndistance as to shine with the brightness indicated in the first column.\r\nThey are generally larger than those of stars of the corresponding\r\nmagnitudes, from which we conclude that the sun is smaller than the\r\nbrighter of the stars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREVENTIVE INOCULATION. (II.)\r\n\r\nBY DR. W. M. HAFFKINE,\r\n\r\nDIRECTOR-IN-CHIEF, GOVERNMENT PLAGUE RESEARCH LABORATORY, BOMBAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a previous paper I reviewed briefly the history of preventive\r\ninoculation and described the results of my attempts to secure a ‘virus\r\nfixé’ in the case of cholera. It will be remembered that the two\r\nvaccines finally obtained protected guinea pigs successfully against\r\nall possible forms of cholera infection.\r\n\r\nIt was now necessary to ascertain whether the same protection could\r\nbe given to man which was observed in animals. For this purpose it\r\nwas essential to first of all prove the perfect harmlessness of the\r\noperation. This was established by very careful observations of medical\r\nmen and scientists who were inoculated in Europe soon after the results\r\nof the above investigations were published. The inoculation causes a\r\nrise of temperature and general discomfort, which lasts one or two\r\ndays, and some pain at the seat of the injection, which disappears\r\nin a few days. The fever and discomfort induced are, on the whole,\r\nshorter in duration, though often more intense, than those caused by\r\nvaccination against smallpox. The effect disappears within a few days\r\nand the individual returns to his usual condition of health.\r\n\r\nThe next and all-important stage was to devise an experiment or a\r\nseries of experiments on man so as to test the efficiency of the method\r\nagainst cholera attacks. This part of the investigation could only be\r\ndone in a cholera-stricken country, where opportunities would arise of\r\ncomparing the incidence of the disease in inoculated and uninoculated.\r\nSuch opportunities are limited. Except in certain parts of India\r\nand China, cholera appears in localities unexpectedly and does not\r\nlast long. In the places where the disease is endemic the cases are\r\nscattered over large areas. These features rendered the demonstration\r\nof the effect of the vaccine a matter of particular difficulty. In\r\n1893 I went to India, and in the course of a year inoculated some\r\ntwenty-three thousand people in the northern parts of the country;\r\nbut no cholera appeared in their midst to show whether the vaccine\r\nwas of value or not. In the spring of 1894 the inoculations were\r\nintroduced into Bengal, and, with the assistance and co-operation of\r\nProf. W. J. Simpson, of King’s College, London, at that time Health\r\nOfficer of Calcutta, and of his staff, efforts were made to induce the\r\ninhabitants of the _bustees_ of Calcutta to get themselves inoculated.\r\nThese bustees are isolated villages consisting of groups of mud huts\r\ninhabited by the poorer class. Owing to the consumption of water from\r\nthe ponds or tanks belonging to these villages, the inhabitants of the\r\nbustees are subject to periodic visitations of cholera. It was in one\r\nof these bustees that the first observation was made as to the effect\r\nof the cholera vaccines.\r\n\r\nThe spring is essentially the cholera season in Calcutta. About the end\r\nof March two fatal cases of cholera and two cases of choleraic diarrhœa\r\noccurred in Katal Bagan Bustee, in a population grouped around two\r\ntanks. This outbreak led to the inoculation of one hundred and sixteen\r\npersons in the bustee out of about two hundred. After the inoculation\r\nthere occurred nine more cases of cholera, seven of which proved fatal,\r\nand one case of choleraic diarrhœa. All the ten cases occurred among\r\nthe uninoculated portion of the inhabitants, which formed the minority,\r\nnone of the inoculated suffering. The results were more interesting\r\nwhen analyzed in detail. Some of the cases had occurred in families in\r\nwhich some of the members had been inoculated and others not, and the\r\ndisease selected the non-inoculated members, sparing the inoculated.\r\nThus, in one house six members out of eight had been inoculated. The\r\nattack, a fatal one, occurred in one of the remaining two. In another\r\nhouse eleven members out of eighteen were inoculated. The eleven\r\nmembers remained free while four out of seven not inoculated were\r\nattacked.\r\n\r\nUpon these observations the Calcutta municipality felt encouraged to\r\nvote funds for the continuance of the inoculations in an experimental\r\nfarm, and appointed for that purpose a special staff. In 1896 the\r\nresult of two years’ observations were embodied by the health officer\r\nin a report to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation. It recorded a most\r\nsatisfactory state of affairs. During the time under observation some\r\neight thousand persons were inoculated. Cases of cholera occurred\r\nin seventy-seven huts in which some members of the family had been\r\npreviously inoculated and others not. Comparing the incidence of the\r\ndisease in the two groups, a striking advantage was found to be with\r\nthe inoculated. I made an analysis of the cases according to the time\r\nwhich had elapsed between inoculation in each of these huts and the\r\noccurrence of cholera in them, and the following results were found.\r\nDuring the first four days after inoculation, apparently before\r\nthe vaccine had time to produce its full protective effect, there\r\nwere proportionately 1.86 times fewer deaths among the inoculated\r\nthan among the non-inoculated members of the families. In a second\r\nperiod, extending from the fifth to the four hundred and twenty-ninth\r\nday--i. e., for fourteen months--there were 22.62 times fewer deaths\r\namong the inoculated; while in the last period--that is, between the\r\nfour hundred and thirtieth and seven hundred and twenty-eighth day\r\nafter the inoculation--there were only 1.54 fewer deaths among the\r\ninoculated, the immunity having evidently gradually disappeared. The\r\nnet result was that for two years after inoculation, including the\r\nperiods of incomplete protection, there was a reduction in mortality\r\nof 72.47 per cent among the inoculated; or in other words, in houses\r\nin which inoculations were performed and in which cholera subsequently\r\noccurred there were, even from the day of inoculation, before the full\r\neffect of it could be produced, eleven deaths among the non-inoculated\r\nto only three among the inoculated. Eight lives out of every eleven\r\nwere saved.\r\n\r\nAt the end of my first cholera campaign, in August, 1895, there were\r\naltogether 31,056 natives of India, 125 Eurasians, 869 Europeans of the\r\ncivil population, 6,627 native officers and sepoys, and 294 officers\r\nwith 3,206 men of the British troops stationed in India, in all 41,787\r\npeople, who had submitted to inoculation. Observations instituted among\r\nthem, especially among prisoners, soldiers and coolies in tea estates,\r\nwith regard to whom detailed records could be kept, went to confirm\r\nthe results as detailed above. In order to lengthen, if possible,\r\nthe period of immunity, the plan was formed of inoculating stronger\r\nvaccines and in higher doses. The inoculations are now carried on in\r\na Government laboratory, in Purulia, Bengal, chiefly among the people\r\nemigrating to the cholera districts of Assam, and there is no doubt\r\nthat in the course of time a marked effect upon the prevalence of\r\ncholera in those districts will be produced and valuable theoretical\r\ndata will be obtained.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was one noticeable feature about the results of the inoculation\r\nagainst cholera which early attracted my attention, and this was that\r\nwhile the number of attacks and the absolute number of deaths was\r\nstrikingly influenced by the operation, the proportion of deaths to\r\nthose attacked did not appear to be changed. The case incidence was\r\neffectively checked, but the ‘case mortality’ was not reduced. The\r\ninoculation diminished the chances of an attack of cholera--that is,\r\nthe chances of the cholera virus penetrating into the tissues of a\r\nman; but if it so happened that the patient was attacked and the virus\r\nfound an entrance and started growing in the system notwithstanding the\r\ninoculation, the latter would not assist in mitigating the severity of\r\nthe symptoms or reducing the fatality of the disease. In analyzing this\r\nresult further, it seemed to me permissible to assume that the vaccine\r\nprotected against the cholera microbes themselves, but did not protect\r\nagainst their poisonous products, which are the cause of the actual\r\nsymptoms.\r\n\r\nThis interpretation of the facts found support in a set of laboratory\r\nexperiments by Professor Pfeiffer and Dr. Kolle, of Koch’s Institute,\r\nin Berlin, who showed that the blood serum of animals and persons\r\ninoculated with the cholera vaccine, as practiced in India, acquired\r\nan intense power of destroying cholera microbes, but exhibited\r\nno properties capable of counteracting the effect of their toxic\r\nproducts--no ‘antitoxic properties’. Combined with those of previous\r\nexperimenters these results tended to prove that two kinds of immunity\r\ncould be produced separately, and it became incumbent to devise a\r\nplan which would secure not only a lowering of susceptibility to the\r\ndisease, but also a reduction in the case mortality.\r\n\r\nFor that purpose it seemed rational to attempt the treatment with a\r\nvaccine containing a combination of bodies of microbes, together with\r\ntheir toxic products. I intended to test this plan experimentally in\r\nthe cholera districts; but, plague having broken out in Bombay, the\r\nGovernment of India commissioned me to inquire into the bacteriology of\r\nthat disease, and I determined that the knowledge gained in the cholera\r\ninoculations should be applied and tested in the preparation of a\r\nprophylactic against the new epidemic.\r\n\r\nThe experiments I had in view involved manufacturing a material on a\r\nlarge scale, and operating on it for weeks continuously. To do this\r\nit was essential to find a way of recognizing plague growth with\r\ncertainty, so as to enable the officers engaged in the manufacture\r\nto control the process and know exactly when they were handling the\r\nproper stuff, and when an admixture and invasion of extraneous growth\r\ntook place. When this was solved, a drug was prepared by cultivating\r\nthe plague microbe in sterilized broth, to which a small quantity\r\nof clarified butter or of cocoanut oil had been added. The plague\r\nbacilli attach themselves to the drops of butter or oil floating on\r\nthe surface, and grow down into the depth of the liquid, forming a\r\npeculiar threadlike appearance. While doing so they secrete toxic\r\nmatter, which is gradually accumulated in the liquid; at the same\r\ntime a large amount of microbial growth comes gradually down from the\r\nsurface of the liquid and collects at the bottom of the flask. When\r\nshaken up the whole represents the desired combination of the bodies\r\nof microbes and of their toxic products. The process is continued for\r\na period of five to six weeks. As the microbes of plague had been very\r\nlittle studied before, and as their exact effect on the human system\r\nwas unknown, I decided not to use for the treatment living microbes,\r\nbut to use at least at first ‘carbolized’ vaccines, though the result\r\nof the treatment might be less favorable or less lasting than that\r\nwhich could be expected from living vaccines. The microbes in the above\r\nplague growth were accordingly killed by heating them at a temperature\r\nranging from 65° to 70° C., and then mixed with a small proportion of\r\ncarbolic acid, to prevent the drug from subsequent contamination and\r\ndecomposition. The dose of the prophylactic was regulated by measuring\r\nup the quantity to be injected. The requisite amount is determined by\r\nthe degree of fever which it produces. The febrile reaction varies in\r\ndifferent individuals, but a temperature reaching 102° and above in at\r\nleast thirty per cent of those inoculated has been found to indicate\r\na good material. In the cholera, rabies and smallpox vaccines, the\r\nmicrobes being employed in a living state, it was essential to fix the\r\nstrength of the vaccine, for otherwise it was impossible to predict the\r\nbehavior of the microbe when injected into the system. In the case of\r\nthe plague prophylactic the activity of the microbes is arrested before\r\nit is inoculated, and the effect can be regulated, as mentioned above,\r\nby simply measuring up the doses in the same way as is done with any\r\nchemical drug.\r\n\r\nThe expectation formed when devising the plan for the plague\r\nprophylactic has been very fortunately justified, and an advance on the\r\nresults from the cholera vaccines was obtained; but I can not yet say\r\ncertainly whether this favorable result is indeed due to the particular\r\nprovisions which I had made for obtaining it.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the plague prophylactic was first tested at the Byculla\r\nJail, in Bombay, when the epidemic reached that establishment. From\r\nthe first day after the inoculation till the end of the outbreak there\r\nwere in the jail twelve cases and six deaths among one hundred and\r\nseventy-two uninoculated inmates, and two cases, with no deaths, among\r\none hundred and forty-seven inoculated. A year later, almost exactly\r\na similar result was observed when the plague attacked the so-called\r\nUmarkhadi Common Jail, in Bombay. In this case after the inoculation\r\nthere were ten cases and six deaths among one hundred and twenty-seven\r\nuninoculated inmates, and three cases, with no deaths, among one\r\nhundred and forty-seven inoculated. These and other observations show\r\nthat the vaccine for the plague begins to exercise its effect within\r\nsome twenty-four hours after inoculation; that it is useful even in\r\nthe case of persons already infected; that it is therefore applicable\r\nat any stage of an epidemic. Numerous further observations were soon\r\ncollected on the working of the system.\r\n\r\nAt the small village of Uudhera, of the Baroda feudatory state, where\r\nplague broke out, inoculation was applied to a half of each family, the\r\nother half remaining uninoculated. After that there were twenty-seven\r\ncases and twenty-six deaths among sixty-four uninoculated, and eight\r\ncases, with three deaths, among seventy-one inoculated of the same\r\nhouseholds, the proportionate difference in mortality being over\r\neighty-nine per cent. There followed observations on a far larger\r\nscale, demonstrating that the mortality of the inoculated, compared\r\nto that of the non-inoculated, was on an average between eighty and\r\nninety per cent less. Sometimes this reduction reached ninety per cent.\r\nIn the Punjaub, in a village called Bunga, there occurred, in two\r\nhundred and eighty-one not inoculated, ninety-seven cases of plague and\r\nsixty-five deaths, while among seventy-four inoculated there were six\r\ncases, but no deaths. In Bangalore, among 80,285 of the inhabitants not\r\ninoculated, there were 2,208 deaths from plague, while among 23,537\r\ninoculated there were only 108. The observations at Lanowli, Kirkee,\r\nDaman, Hubli, Dharwar, Gadag, in the Bombay Presidency, gave the same\r\nresults. At Hubli over forty-two thousand inhabitants out of some\r\nfifty thousand were inoculated. In Bombay city, out of a population\r\nof 821,764, 157,256 have now undergone the inoculation. The work\r\nproceeds here at present at the rate of one thousand to eleven hundred\r\ninoculations a day.\r\n\r\nFrom plague hospitals the returns show that among those of the attacked\r\nwho were previously inoculated the mortality is reduced to less than\r\none half of that among patients who were not inoculated. The property\r\nof reducing the case mortality thus appears to belong to the plague\r\nprophylactic in an unmistakable degree.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBy the anti-cholera and anti-plague inoculation the methods of\r\npreventive treatment by means of cultivated bacteria and their products\r\nhave been rendered, so to say, a part of the daily policy in human\r\nmedicine. The usefulness and practicability of those methods have\r\nbecome clearly apparent, and steps have been taken to extend further\r\nthe field of their application. On the ground of the experiments\r\nmade with the typhoid bacillus in the Pasteur Institute in 1889-’93,\r\nand of the results obtained from the anti-cholera inoculation in\r\nIndia, I was able to induce Professor Wright, of the Pathological\r\nLaboratory in Netley, whom I initiated in 1892 in the principles and\r\ntechnique of anti-cholera inoculation, to start a campaign of similar\r\noperations against typhoid among the British troops. The latter are\r\nstationed at different times of their service very nearly in all parts\r\nof the world, and yearly pay a very heavy tribute to that disease.\r\nThe medical officers in charge of these troops pass through a course\r\nof training at Netley, and Professor Wright had rendered excellent\r\nservices in connection with the cholera inoculations, by disseminating\r\nthe knowledge of them among the probationers of the school. It seemed\r\nto me expedient, therefore, to start the typhoid inoculation also\r\nthrough the staff and pupils of that school. The following plan as\r\nto the preparation of the vaccine, and the way of carrying out the\r\ninoculation, was laid before Professor Wright. The typhoid bacillus\r\nwas to be brought to a fixed stage of virulence by the inoculation in\r\nthe peritoneal cavity of Guinea pigs, according to the exact rules\r\nprescribed for the anti-cholera inoculation. Once the virus was fixed,\r\nit was to be cultivated for twenty-four hours on a solid medium, and\r\na first vaccine prepared by carbolizing that virus. As, however, the\r\ndurability of the effect of carbolized vaccine alone was not known,\r\nthis was to be followed up by the injection of a dose of the fixed\r\nliving virus.\r\n\r\nThe inoculation was first to be made on volunteers among the physicians\r\non probation at Netley; then on volunteers among the young officers of\r\nthe army on the eve of their departure for the tropics; and then, with\r\nthe approval of the military authorities, on volunteers among private\r\nsoldiers. At the end of 1895, during my visit to England, I obtained\r\nfrom Sir William Mackinnon, then Director-General of the Army Medical\r\nDepartment, permission for Professor Wright to start the work upon the\r\nplan above detailed; and the first inoculations, in the way described\r\nabove, were done in the middle of 1896. Soon after that, Pfeiffer\r\nand Kolle, recognizing the same similarity between the cholera and\r\ntyphoid microbes, and pointing out that the results obtained by us in\r\nIndia were likely to be repeated when applying the method to typhoid,\r\nproposed and started a similar series of inoculations.\r\n\r\nWhen the inoculation against plague was begun, and observation showed\r\nthat dead vaccines alone were apparently sufficient to produce\r\nsatisfactory results, a second inoculation with living virus appeared\r\nless urgently necessary; and as the effect of such an inoculation,\r\nwhich Professor Wright very courageously tried first on himself,\r\nseemed troublesome, it was decided to do for the time being the second\r\ninoculation also with the carbolized virus. Similarly, the plan which\r\nwas adopted for the plague inoculation, of cultivating the vaccine\r\nin a liquid, instead of a solid medium, and of using cultures of\r\nseveral weeks’ duration, has been subsequently adopted in the typhoid\r\ninoculation also.\r\n\r\nMany thousands of British soldiers and civilians have already undergone\r\nthe inoculation in question. The latter was done partly with vaccines\r\ncultivated on a solid medium, according to the older plan, and\r\npartly with vaccines prepared according to the plague inoculation\r\nmethod. The results so far observed are encouraging, and, I hope,\r\nwill shortly be improved considerably. At the last Harveian dinner in\r\nLondon, Surgeon-General Jameson, Director-General of the Army Medical\r\nDepartment, summarized the results of the observations in India, where,\r\namong several thousands of young soldiers, the most prone to the\r\ndisease, the incidence of typhoid since their inoculation was 0.7 per\r\nmille, while among the older, more resistant, not inoculated soldiers,\r\nthe incidence was during the same period just double that. A large\r\nproportion of the force now on service in the South African campaign\r\nhave been inoculated, some before embarking and others on their way out.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSuch is the position of preventive inoculation, as applied, so far, to\r\nhuman communities. The very success of these operations is now apt to\r\ncreate some sort of feigned or earnest alarm, and one meets at present\r\nwith the question, What is going to happen to our poor body if we\r\nare to be inoculated against _all_ diseases? and with this other one,\r\nHow do you expect us to make a _living_ if you try to keep all of us\r\nalive? The humorous form of these questions usually permits of their\r\ndropping out of the conversation without a reply. The earnest answers\r\nare, however, obvious. The efforts of the bacteriologists in combating\r\ndiseases are at present directed to a twofold aim: their prevention, by\r\na prophylactic treatment, and their cure. The advantage of a curative\r\ntreatment is that it is to be applied to a relatively small number of\r\npersons, to those who actually fall victims to an attack; while that\r\nof the preventive treatment is in the greater certainty with which\r\nsafety and protection are secured by it. The relative position of the\r\ntwo treatments will, in practice, differ in different diseases--namely,\r\naccording to the prevalence and fatality of a given disease, and\r\naccording to the merits of the two treatments as they stand at the\r\ntime. In diseases in which the risks of being attacked are smaller,\r\nor the consequences of an attack less serious, or for which a very\r\neffective and sure curative treatment has been discovered, the majority\r\nof people will prefer to wait for an actual attack rather than to\r\nundergo the discomfort of a preventive treatment; in diseases, on the\r\ncontrary, in which the chances of being attacked are great, or in which\r\nthe fatality is higher, the sequelæ of an attack more serious, and for\r\nwhich a successful and not very troublesome preventive treatment has\r\nbeen found, large numbers will undergo preventive inoculation. But,\r\neven in the latter case, a mutual co-operation between the two methods\r\nwill exist always, as there will always be a number of people, either\r\namong those who have neglected to protect themselves by inoculation,\r\nor among those in whom the inoculation has proved unsuccessful, who\r\nwill fall victims to an attack and require the benefits of a curative\r\ntreatment, be those at the time little or great.\r\n\r\nThe answer to the second question is of course to be expected rather\r\nfrom the politico-economist, the wise administrator, the civilian, than\r\nfrom the bacteriologist. In any case it is clear already that if we\r\nare ever to be told that we must thin our ranks, we shall prefer not\r\nto leave the task in the hands of the indiscriminating microbe, but to\r\nhave some voice in the matter ourselves. Inoculation marks only the\r\nconquest of another force which henceforth we shall be glad to control.\r\n\r\n    BOMBAY, INDIA, _March, 1900_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLONIES AND THE MOTHER COUNTRY. (II.)\r\n\r\nBY JAMES COLLIER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe growth of the relations between a colony and the mother country\r\nclosely follows the development of the relationship between an\r\norganism and its offspring, or (in higher species) between parents and\r\nchildren. When an infusorian subdivides into two cells, the new cell\r\nproduced swims away and henceforth leads an independent life. Most\r\nof the Phœnician and most of the earlier Greek colonies were social\r\ninfusoria which parted from the parent organism by segmentation and\r\nhad no further relations with it. As we rise in the animal scale a\r\nnew relationship, that between mother and young, and a new instinct,\r\nthe maternal, come into existence. These begin as low down as the\r\nmollusks, and expand and heighten, though not without strange lapses,\r\nin both insects and birds as species develope; but we need not trace\r\nthe evolution here. Let it suffice to note that there are successive\r\ndegrees of specialization; a site is chosen suitable for depositing and\r\nhatching eggs; means are found for making them secure; a shelter is\r\nbuilt for them; they are deposited near substances adapted to nourish\r\nthe young; special food is prepared for them; they are reared through\r\nfood disgorged or brought to them. The accession of the male to the\r\nfamily marks the dawn of the paternal instinct; it appears earliest\r\namong fishes. This evolution is repeated in the history of colonies,\r\nwhere, however, the maternal and paternal offices melt into one another\r\ninsensibly.\r\n\r\nThe mother country founds and nurtures colonies. Most of the earliest\r\ncolonies are the work of adventurous bands or navigating merchants\r\nor fishermen, who seek their own habitats, carry with them their own\r\nequipment and fight their own battles. Then the metropolis settles its\r\nsurplus or discontented citizens in territories previously chosen,\r\nprovides them with all that is necessary for their start, and often\r\nnourishes them during the infancy of the colony. Hispaniola was a state\r\ncolony manned with miners and artisans who were provided with tools,\r\nand this at the cost of a loan and a draught from the confiscated\r\nproperty of the Jews. Nor was it until gold began to be found in large\r\nquantities that the receipts equalled the expenditure on the young\r\ncolony. Louisiana was founded and fostered with a royal munificence\r\nthat conferred on it “more than was contributed by all the English\r\nmonarchs together for the twelve English colonies on the Atlantic.”\r\nGeorgia was a one-man foundation, but the British Parliament twice\r\ngranted considerable sums to initiate it and carry it on; the Society\r\nfor the Propagation of the Gospel aided, and the benevolence of\r\nphilanthropic England contributed largely to its success. Not till\r\n1818--more than half a century after the conquest--did the revenue\r\nof Canada balance its expenditure. The convict colony of New South\r\nWales was, of course, entirely of state origin. Stores of every kind,\r\ntogether with cattle and seeds, were sent out at the beginning, and\r\nlong continued to be sent out to it. The first governor was granted\r\na space of two years to make it self-supporting, but the growth of\r\na convict colony is abnormally slow, and the civil and military\r\nestablishments for thirty-four years continued to be a drain on the\r\nBritish exchequer to the extent of over ten millions. Even now one of\r\nthe oldest and best of existing British colonies, with an area of over\r\nthree hundred thousand square miles, does not produce the breadstuffs\r\nneeded for its own consumption. The Cape of Good Hope, of mixed Dutch\r\nand French origin, was first made a truly British colony by the\r\ndispatch of six thousand emigrants at the cost of the mother country--a\r\ncost much greater than was anticipated. When the Transvaal was forcibly\r\nannexed by England, the stepmother country advanced a sum of £90,000\r\nto rescue the quondam republic from its financial difficulties. In\r\n1895 Parliament voted three millions for the building of a railroad in\r\nBritish East Africa. Uganda is supported by a British subsidy. Algeria\r\nis a manufactured colony, which has all along had to be supported\r\nby its creator. Apart from the cost of their civil and military\r\nestablishments, France has to subsidize her colonies to the extent of\r\nover four millions sterling, partially expended in reproductive public\r\nworks. Even tiny New Caledonia costs France half a million, one half of\r\nwhich, it is true, is expended on the convict establishment.\r\n\r\nMost colonies at their beginning are burdensome to the mother country.\r\nYears after its foundation South Australia fell into such embarrassment\r\nthat its governors had to draw on the imperial exchequer for nearly a\r\nmillion. In 1834 the expenditure in Cape Colony was still in excess of\r\nthe revenue. Sierra Leone had to be aided by a parliamentary grant year\r\nafter year. No wonder the Colonial Office complained that colonies were\r\nexpensive to keep up. In German Africa the revenue does not meet the\r\nexpenditure. The Congo Free State does not pay its way. On the other\r\nhand, Congo Française has a substantial surplus. Western Australia was\r\nanother exception to the rule. There the Imperial Government announced\r\nthat it would contribute nothing to the foundation of the colony,\r\nwhich was to be self-supporting from the first. Private capitalists\r\nwere to arrange for the emigration of ten thousand persons in four\r\nyears. Lands were granted to the emigrants on a scale of extravagance\r\nwhich long hampered the progress of the colony. Companies likewise\r\nexpend large sums in many colonies. French and English companies\r\nembarked on American, Indian, African and island adventures at ruinous\r\nloss. Law’s company withdrew from Louisiana, the New Zealand Company\r\nfrom New Zealand, and the Canterbury Association from Canterbury\r\nwith a balance on the wrong side of the account. Wealthy individuals\r\nbear their part. Mr. Rhodes annually subsidizes the British Central\r\nAfrican Protectorate, and King Leopold the Congo Free State. Colonial\r\nbishoprics have also been endowed and colonial cathedrals built,\r\nlargely with the aid of voluntary contributions by sympathizers in the\r\nmother country.\r\n\r\nThe mother state sometimes gives the colonies the benefit of her\r\nfinancial good name. In 1869 England withdrew her regiments from\r\nNew Zealand when the colony was still at war with the Maoris, and\r\nto salve the wounded feelings of the colonists she agreed (under\r\npressure) to guarantee a loan of a million in aid of emigration and\r\npublic works. Before the Canadian Pacific Railway could be completed\r\nthe Imperial Government had to guarantee a loan of £3,600,000. Mr.\r\nRhodes proposes (unsuccessfully, it now appears) that the Imperial\r\nGovernment, which contributed £200,000 to the cost of a railway from\r\nKimberley to Buluwayo, should guarantee a loan of an enormous amount\r\nfor the continuation of the African trunk railway from Buluwayo to Lake\r\nTanganyika.\r\n\r\nThe mother country supports or aids its self-governing colonies through\r\nits capitalists. In order to execute public works--roads, bridges and\r\nrailways--to assist immigration, to build fortresses, and sometimes\r\nto pay the interest on previous loans, all the colonies have habitual\r\nrecourse to the British Stock Exchange. There are good reasons for\r\nthis. The colonies have little capital of their own, for all their\r\nmoney has been used up from day to day. The English investor has\r\nan almost unlimited amount--the savings mainly of one industrious\r\ncentury--and he is prepared to lend it at a lower rate of interest than\r\nwould content the colonial capitalist. Of over two thousand millions\r\nsterling which John Bull has out at usury all over the world, the total\r\npublic and private indebtedness of the seven Australasian colonies\r\nalone, with a population of four millions, is stated to exceed three\r\nhundred and twenty millions, or at the rate of eighty pounds per head\r\nof these daring colonists. One half of this sum is due from colonial\r\ngovernments for the purposes already named. The half of it, due from\r\nbanks, building companies, mercantile associations and mortgage\r\nagencies, excites no misgivings; these institutions can always go\r\nbankrupt, as many of them did in the financial collapse of 1891-’93.\r\nBut it is not open to a British colony to file its schedules, or at\r\nleast so we used to think; and so the Times said till the oldest of\r\nBritish colonies went bankrupt the other day. At all events, it is\r\nharder, and we contemplate this enormous pile of public indebtedness\r\nin young and scantily peopled communities with the same feelings as\r\nmade alarmists foresee impending ruin in the growing augmentation\r\nof the gigantic public debt of the United Kingdom. It is commonly\r\nsaid that while the imperial debt has been accumulated as the cost\r\nof “just and necessary wars,” or of wars that were neither just nor\r\nnecessary, the colonial debt has been contracted for the execution of\r\nreproductive public works. This is not altogether so. Eleven million\r\npounds of the public debt of New Zealand were contracted to carry on\r\nwar with the Maoris, who were defending their territory. The Seven\r\nYears’ War, which was begun on the part of England to gain possession\r\nof the Ohio Valley and thus increase the extent of her colonies,\r\ndoubled her public debt. Where is the difference between the two\r\nclasses of expenditure? Then most of the self-governing colonies have\r\nexpended large sums in fortifying ports, some in partly supporting\r\na fleet, and one at least in purchasing war ships of its own. Nor\r\nhas all the remainder been reproductively expended. The building of\r\nschools is a wise way of spending money, one’s own or another’s, but\r\nit can not be called a materially reproductive way. Governors’ and\r\nministerial residences, parliamentary and departmental buildings, are\r\nindispensable, but they can not be called ‘assets,’ especially if built\r\nof perishable and inflammable timber. Even railways, most profitable of\r\npublic works, are not always true assets. In many of the colonies they\r\nare light railways, and when traffic increases and a higher speed is\r\nrequired they will have to be built over again and new rolling stock\r\nprocured. Not a few of them, too, are ‘political railways,’ running\r\nthrough a sparsely populated country no-whither, and built to capture\r\nvotes. Roads are only less valuable, but they were made (sometimes by\r\ngraduates and men of scientific antecedents who were afterward cabinet\r\nministers) at the wage rate of from two guineas to four pounds ten per\r\nweek, and are an inadequate return on the outlay. Last century British\r\nloans were issued as prizes to friends of ministers, and a much reduced\r\namount found its way to the treasury. Deduct an analogous, though\r\nnot quite similar, item of waste in colonial loans, add this to all\r\nthe other non-reproductive elements, and the genuinely reproductive\r\nproportion will shrink considerably. Every one of the colonies, even\r\nwith the fee simple of territories only less than Europe in extent in\r\ntheir hands, would have sunk under the increasing burden. Happily or\r\nnot, the ever-growing wealth of England has so cheapened money that the\r\ninterest charge on the whole Australasian indebtedness sank in five\r\nyears (1890-’96), mainly through conversion of loans, from fourteen\r\nmillions to twelve and a quarter. It may be added that the colonies\r\nwhich have borrowed most recklessly have not been the most populous or\r\nthose with largest resources, but rather the socialistic colonies with\r\nbig schemes on hand.\r\n\r\nA father may assist his son by supplying him with the capital needed to\r\ncarry on his business. Thus it is entirely with the mother country’s\r\nmoney that the first colonial banks are founded. As the colony grows\r\nwealthier and the business of the banks extends, colonial shareholders\r\npurchase stock in it, but the number of British shareholders remains\r\nconsiderable. A typical example is that of the Bank of New Zealand,\r\nfrom two fifths to one half of whose shares are (or in 1888 were)\r\nheld in the United Kingdom. In the older or wealthier colonies of New\r\nSouth Wales and Victoria the number of English shareholders may be\r\nsmaller, though still large. A still larger proportion of the shares\r\nof the great colonial steamship companies, amounting possibly to three\r\nfourths or nine tenths of the whole, is held (chiefly by commercial\r\nmen and firms) in Great Britain. Many commercial undertakings in all\r\nthe colonies are engineered entirely by English capital (not included\r\nin the two thousand millions). The Canadian transcontinental railway;\r\nrailways, electric tramway lines and silver mines in Tasmania; the\r\nMidland Railway and also copper mines in New Zealand; the gold mines\r\nin Western Australia to such an extent that much more English capital\r\nis said to pour into that colony than gold flows out of it--are only\r\na few colonial enterprises that would never have been undertaken but\r\nfor the mother country’s aid. Some of these are lucrative, others\r\nnot; some have been abandoned, and others belong to a still darker\r\nclass. “Uncounted millions of capital have been raised in the central\r\nmoney market of London, only to be fooled away in ill-conceived and\r\nmisdirected enterprises abroad,” says Lord Brassey. Nor are the losses\r\nconfined to questionable undertakings. Two great Australasian banks\r\nhave frittered away their entire capital of four and three millions,\r\nrespectively, and it may be assumed that the British investor has\r\nborne one half of the losses. Of half a dozen smaller colonial banks\r\na similar tale might be told. Father and son have to share in one\r\nanother’s adversity, as in one another’s prosperity.\r\n\r\nThe socialistic movement in England has lately so strongly reacted on\r\nthe relations of the Imperial Government with the colonies that the\r\nSecretary of State is believed to be willing to employ the resources\r\nof the empire to assist backward colonies. He has invited English\r\ncapitalists to aid the declining West Indies, and a leading firm has\r\noffered to invest a million in the sugar industry if a guarantee\r\nof sufficient returns is given. The constitution of the projected\r\nAustralian Federation contains a novel analogous provision, permitting\r\nthe commonwealth to aid its needy provinces. The growing unity in the\r\nsocial organism as a whole is accompanied by an increasing unity in its\r\ncomponent parts.\r\n\r\nThe mother country continues to defend its colonies, as animals defend\r\ntheir young and parents their children. But the polyp does not defend\r\nits offspring, nor did the earliest colonizing powers succor their\r\ncolonies. While not even the armed persuasion of Cambyses could induce\r\nTyre to make war against Carthage, neither seems to have helped the\r\nother in its need. Carthage fought savagely for her Sicilian colonies,\r\nbut in her own interests, not in theirs. Though the ties between a\r\nGreek metropolis and her colonies were closer, the one did not\r\ninvariably defend the other. Corcyra refused the aid her daughter city\r\nEpidaurus sought, and the latter had to find it in the grandmother city\r\nof Corinth, who considered it _her_ colony no less than that of Corcyra.\r\nThe Dorian city was celebrated for her typical Greek patriotism, and\r\nshe gladly assisted Syracuse to expel her Carthaginian conquerors. Rome\r\nfought for her colonies while her power lasted. France and England\r\nfought for their colonies, or rather for the possession of them, all\r\nthrough the eighteenth century. Spain has just fought for her last\r\ncolonies, but as much against the colonists as against the foreign\r\nstate that came to set them free. The mother country is also at the\r\ncost of keeping her colonies in a state of defence. The sum of £9,000\r\nwas in 1679 annually expended on the maintenance of English soldiers in\r\nVirginia and two West Indian colonies, and £1,000 on the fortifications\r\nof New York. Troops were often dispatched to assist the American\r\ncolonies in special expeditions. The colonial military expenditure of\r\nGreat Britain in 1859 amounted to nearly £1,200,000. In compliance\r\nwith the findings of a Royal Commission, repeatedly reaffirmed by\r\nresolutions of Parliament, to the effect that the self-governing\r\ncolonies ought to suffice for their own military defense, the troops\r\nwere finally withdrawn in 1873, but she still maintains a garrison at\r\nHalifax and in Natal and a fleet in Australian waters, to which last\r\nthe adjacent colonies contribute a fraction. Most of the self-governing\r\ncolonies have at their own cost erected fortresses, and they maintain\r\na defensive force. Two of them have stationary ships of war. They are\r\nwilling and eager, moreover, to aid the mother country when she is in\r\ndifficulties. When England was embroiled in Egypt or danger threatened\r\nin India and South Africa, several of these colonies offered to send,\r\nand one actually sent, troops to engage in wars in which they were\r\nnot directly concerned. The head and the extremities are sometimes at\r\nvariance because their interests conflict. The heart of such an empire\r\nis one. A stride has been taken toward organic unity.\r\n\r\nAnimals evolve special organs for the nursing of their young, and all\r\ncolonizing countries seem to have created special departments for the\r\nsupervision of their colonies. As the lacteal glands are only modified\r\nskin-glands, are in certain lower genera (the Monotremata) at first\r\nwithout teats and only in higher species develop into true mammæ, so\r\nthe colonial department in the mother country is originally a mere\r\nadaptation of existing agencies. A rather perfect example of this stage\r\nis presented by the earliest of modern colonizing powers. The Casa de\r\nla Contratacion de las Indias, established soon after the discovery of\r\nSouth America, was organized in 1503. It granted licenses, equipped and\r\ndespatched fleets, received merchandise for export and cargoes imported\r\nand contracted for their sale. It controlled the trade with Barbary and\r\nthe Canaries and supervised the shipping business of Cadiz and Seville.\r\nTaking cognizance of all questions concerning marine trade, it was\r\nadvised by two jurists. It also kept the Spanish government informed\r\nof all that concerned the colonies. It was a general board of colonial\r\nmarine trade, and such it remained even when, a few years later, its\r\nmore important colonial functions were absorbed by a higher department.\r\n\r\nWhere the colony has been founded by a commercial or by a colonizing\r\ncompany, the mother country controls the colony through the directors\r\nof the company; the office of the company is _pro tanto_ the\r\nColonial Office. Yet the later colonial department, as an organ of\r\ngovernment, is not a development of these shipping, commercial or\r\ncolonizing boards. It is a delegation of the sovereign authority.\r\nThis is at first exercised directly by the sovereign as it was\r\nnotably by Isabella and Ferdinand. It is next delegated, like almost\r\nall functions of the ruler, to his privy council, which assigns the\r\nbusiness of colonies to a committee, which again may be set apart as\r\nan independent administrative body. The Spanish Council of the Indies,\r\nthe separate English privy council for colonial affairs contemplated\r\nin the first Virginian charter, the Council of Nine appointed by the\r\nStates-General of the Netherlands, the Swedish royal council, were\r\nsuch bodies. Their powers are everywhere the same. The superintendence\r\nof the whole colonial system is entrusted to them. They have supreme\r\njurisdiction over all the colonies. They appoint and may recall\r\nviceroys, governors-general, governors and other local officers. They\r\ncan veto laws and ordinances made by colonial rulers or legislatures.\r\nThey frame constitutions for the colonies and enact laws. Through the\r\ngovernors and other officers sent out by them, they minutely supervise\r\nand incessantly interfere with the whole internal administration\r\nof each colony. The tendency of this supreme council is to divorce\r\nitself evermore from the privy council and become independent, till\r\nat last it is transformed into a ministerial department. Yet an\r\namicable relationship (such as sometimes survives the divorce court)\r\nlong remains. The Colonial Committee of the privy council in England\r\nwas summoned as late as 1849, and the Judicial Committee still hears\r\nappeals from colonial courts of justice. The government of the\r\ncommonwealth was naturally averse to the king’s council, and a body\r\nof special commissioners (Cromwell and Pym and Vane among them) was\r\nappointed to govern the colonies.\r\n\r\nThe Restoration did not at once return to the old system. On the\r\ncontrary, a remarkable democratic advance was made. Recognizing that\r\nthough ‘politics lie outside the profession of merchants’ (as the\r\nSwedish and British governments declared), yet trade is eminently\r\nwithin their scope, the restored monarchy set up a Council of Trade and\r\nPlantations, of whose forty members twenty were elected representatives\r\nof the five merchant companies and the incorporated trades. But there\r\nwas ever a tendency, at least under the despotic rule of the Stuarts,\r\nto revert to the privy council, and in 1674 a standing committee of\r\nit was appointed Lords of the Committee of Trade and Plantations. The\r\nchange appears to have been unimportant. Trade still governed the\r\ncommittee and shaped its policy.\r\n\r\nThe Board of Trade set up in 1696, rather by the House of Commons\r\nthan by the Ministry, marked the more popular character of the\r\nrevolution of 1688, and lasted for ninety years. As if foreshadowing\r\nthe despotic character of the English reaction against the greater\r\nFrench revolution, this board was abolished by an act introduced by\r\nthe chief reactionary--Edmund Burke. A committee of the Privy Council\r\nfor Trade and Plantations was in 1786 again resorted to, and this\r\ncommittee in a shadowy manner survived (perhaps it still survives)\r\ntill 1849, when it was for the last time summoned by Earl Grey. But\r\nthe real administration of the colonies had long been in the hands\r\nof a department of state, directly responsible to Parliament, though\r\nit was still a department that dealt with other affairs as well.\r\nSpecialization began in 1702 by the colonies being assigned to the\r\nSecretary for the Southern Department. In 1768 a separate department\r\nwith a secretary was created for America, where almost all of the\r\ncolonies were then situated. After the loss of most of the American\r\ncolonies the new department was abolished in 1782. The colonies were\r\nthen annexed to the home department. In 1794 the newly created war\r\ndepartment nominally included the colonies, though these were not\r\nactually united with it till the Committee for Trade and Plantations\r\nceased to act, seven years later. In 1854 a separate colonial\r\ndepartment, with an independent secretary of state, was finally\r\ncreated.[A]\r\n\r\n    [A] The history of the relations between the government of\r\n        Great Britain and her colonies will be found in many books,\r\n        but best in Mr. Egerton’s comprehensive survey of British\r\n        colonial policy.\r\n\r\nAs there were twenty-three secretaries in forty-one years, it will be\r\nreadily understood that the practical work of administration remained\r\nwith the permanent officials. With a longer tenure of office, previous\r\ntraining and thorough mastery of details, they held all the threads of\r\ncolonial administration in their own hands. A newly-appointed minister,\r\nwith little knowledge of the colonies and no acquaintance at all with\r\nthe business of his department, was no match for an experienced officer\r\nwho had colonial affairs at his fingers’ ends.\r\n\r\nA mere clerk, unknown outside his office, though well known in\r\nliterature, could recall a governor; another, whose very name was\r\nunknown till he died, recommended (that is, commanded on pain of\r\ndismissal) a recent Governor of New Zealand to give away to his\r\nministers on a crucial exercise of the prerogative.\r\n\r\nNor is it in matters of routine alone that the permanent officers shape\r\nthe course of colonial administration. A strong-minded minister with\r\na policy of his own, like Lord Grey or Lord Carnarvon, will force his\r\nsubordinates to carry it out, but even here a still stronger-minded\r\nunder-secretary will often have his way. In 1848 Lord Grey, then\r\nSecretary for the Colonies, summoned the aged and moribund Committee\r\n(of the privy council) on Trade and Plantations to advise with him\r\non the policy to be adopted towards the Australian colonies. The\r\nreport was drafted by Sir James Stephen and we have no difficulty in\r\ndiscovering in its far-sighted proposals and masculine style the mind\r\nas well as the hand of the author of the essay on ‘Hildebrand.’ It is\r\noften said that a state department is inevitably wedded to routine.\r\nIn the report just mentioned the striking feature is the outline of a\r\nsystem of Australian federation that is only now on the point of being\r\nrealized. So far was the pedantic Colonial Office then, as it has often\r\nbeen before and since, ahead of its subject colonies.\r\n\r\nThe other colonizing countries have followed the same line of\r\ndevelopment. Beginning as direct delegations of the sovereign power\r\nto a branch, first constituent and then separated, of the sovereign’s\r\ncouncil, the department of colonies has been in course of time made an\r\nindependent ministry directly answerable to parliament. In bureaucratic\r\nFrance the colonies since 1854 have been associated with the navy. On\r\nthe first of January, 1899, the empire on which the sun never set,\r\nhaving lost the last of the dependencies that were once its glory,\r\nabolished its colonial office. The sun had set on Spain to rise no\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL EDUCATION AT THE MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY.\r\n\r\nBY PROFESSOR GEORGE F. SWAIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the enormous progress in the arts and sciences which has\r\ncharacterized especially the last half of the nineteenth century,\r\neducation has kept well abreast, although its progress has been gradual\r\nand it is not always easy to recognize the great advances that have\r\nbeen made. In the sciences, a discovery is made or a machine invented\r\nthat in the course of a few years forms the basis of a new industry,\r\ngives occupation to thousands and places within the reach of almost\r\nevery one conveniences previously attainable only by the few. In\r\neducation no such sudden revolutions occur, and great changes are\r\nintroduced by degrees without producing any commotion or any surprise.\r\nFrom the days of Erasmus and Rabelais, if not earlier, educational\r\nreformers have urged the importance of studying things rather than\r\nbooks about things, of cultivating the hand and eye as well as the\r\nmind, of training the perceptive powers, of cultivating a habit of\r\nobservation and discrimination, and of developing the faculty of\r\njudgment. Yet, notwithstanding all that has been said and written,\r\nprogress in this direction has until recently been very slow. Carlyle,\r\napparently looking at the matter almost from the old scholastic\r\nstandpoint, expressed the opinion that the true university of modern\r\ntimes was a great library; books, not things, should be studied. It\r\nwould conform more to the modern point of view to say that the true\r\nuniversity of the twentieth century is a great laboratory. Even the\r\nfunction of a library in our modern institutions of learning is perhaps\r\nmore that of a laboratory than that of a mere storehouse of facts and\r\nopinions.\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps not too much to say that the development in the direction\r\nindicated has been greatest in our own country; that the United\r\nStates have taken the lead in the revolution against the old method\r\nof teaching, and that at the present time the higher schools of this\r\ncountry are examples of the best practice and the highest development\r\nof the laboratory method. It may, therefore, be of interest to give the\r\nreaders of this magazine a brief account of the school which has in\r\nthese respects been one of the foremost, if indeed it has not led the\r\nschools of this country, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ROGERS BUILDING, MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF\r\nTECHNOLOGY, IS AT THE RIGHT, THE WALKER BUILDING AT THE LEFT.]\r\n\r\nWith the development of the natural sciences and the growth of the\r\nconstructive arts, natural science long ago gained a place in the\r\ncurricula of the great universities of Europe; and afterwards special\r\nschools were founded for teaching the applications of science to the\r\narts. In France, the École des Ponts et Chaussées, originally started\r\nin 1747 as a drawing school, was organized in 1760 for the training of\r\nengineers. In the States of Germany, a number of similar schools were\r\norganized early in the present century. In America, the Rensselaer\r\nPolytechnic Institute, the pioneer in technical education, was founded\r\nin 1824, and was the only school devoted to applied science until the\r\nforties, when Joseph Sheffield and Abbot Lawrence established the\r\nschools which bear their names, in connection, respectively, with\r\nYale and Harvard. With the development of railroads, which dates from\r\nthe thirties, and of manufacturing, which began in this country but\r\na few years earlier, urgent need was felt for schools which should\r\nfit younger men to grapple with the problems which the new industries\r\noffered. These schools, however, maintained for many years but a\r\nprecarious existence and were quite elementary in character. The Civil\r\nWar interrupted their growth and absorbed for a time all the resources\r\nof the nation; but its termination set free an abundant store of\r\nenergy, henceforward to seek its chief application in the development\r\nof trade, commerce, manufacturing and industrial pursuits of every\r\nkind. From this time the success of schools of technology was assured.\r\nThey were needed to supply young men for the development of the arts;\r\nbut, on the other hand, as in all things not purely material, they\r\nwere to create a demand for such men by first furnishing a supply.\r\nManufacturers and leaders of industrial enterprise soon found that\r\nthey could not afford to do without the services of young men trained\r\nin scientific principles. In this way, by reversing the usual law of\r\nsupply and demand, these schools contributed powerfully to advance the\r\ntechnical development of the country, far indeed beyond the measure\r\nthat may be inferred from the mere number of their graduates.\r\n\r\nThe Massachusetts Institute of Technology was chartered in 1861, and\r\nfirst opened to students in 1865. Its claim to recognition as a leader\r\nin the development of technical education may perhaps be summarized as\r\nfollows: It was the first school in the world to institute laboratory\r\ninstruction in physics and chemistry to students in large classes as a\r\npart of the regular course of each candidate for a degree; the first\r\nto equip a mining and metallurgical laboratory for the instruction of\r\nstudents by actual treatment of ores in large quantities; the first to\r\nestablish a laboratory for teaching the nature and uses of steam, and\r\na laboratory for testing the strength of materials of construction in\r\ncommercial sizes; and the first in America to establish a department\r\nof architecture. Later still, it was the first school in America to\r\nestablish distinct and specialized courses of study in electrical\r\nengineering, in sanitary engineering, in chemical engineering and in\r\nnaval architecture.\r\n\r\nThe success of the school has been commensurate with its\r\nprogressiveness. It stands to-day the largest, most complete school of\r\nits class in the United States, and one of the largest in the world.\r\nThe number of its students is 1,176, the number of its teachers,\r\nincluding lecturers, 175. Excluding lecturers, the number of students\r\nper teacher is only 8.7, a ratio which is a good general index of the\r\ncharacter of the instruction. The students come from 40 States and\r\nTerritories of the Union and from 12 foreign countries.\r\n\r\nBefore passing to a more detailed description of the work of its\r\nvarious departments, some general characteristics of the school\r\nshould be mentioned. The first is the great variety of its courses\r\nand the specialization of its instruction. It is a college of general\r\ntechnology, embracing almost every branch of study which finds\r\napplication in the arts. There are thirteen distinct courses of study:\r\nCivil and topographical engineering, mechanical engineering, mining\r\nengineering and metallurgy, architecture, chemistry, electrical\r\nengineering, biology, physics, general studies, chemical engineering,\r\nsanitary engineering, geology and naval architecture. These several\r\ndepartments mutually support and reinforce each other, and allow a\r\nspecialization of the instruction which would be impossible in a\r\nsmaller college with a less numerous staff of instructors. Thus,\r\nat the Institute of Technology, there are not only professors of\r\ncivil engineering and of mechanical engineering, but professors\r\nof mechanism, steam engineering, railroad engineering, highway\r\nengineering, hydraulic engineering, topographical engineering, etc.\r\nAgain, the chemical staff of twenty-four persons is distributed over\r\ngeneral chemistry, analytical chemistry, organic chemistry, industrial\r\nchemistry and sanitary chemistry. There are separate laboratories for\r\nwater analysis, for gas analysis, for food analysis, for dyeing and\r\nbleaching, etc. In each of these there are teachers who are able to\r\ngive their entire time to instruction and research in a single line.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILLIAM BARTON ROGERS, PRESIDENT, 1862-1870; 1878-1881.]\r\n\r\nThe second characteristic of the Institute is the predominance of\r\nlaboratory, shop and field practice, experiment and research. These\r\nare used wherever it is found practicable to supplement, illustrate or\r\nemphasize the work of the recitation or lecture-room.\r\n\r\nThe third characteristic of the Institute, and one which is absent in\r\nthe case of many similar schools, is the fact that a not inconsiderable\r\namount of general training has from the beginning been required of\r\nevery candidate for the degree. In some technical or scientific schools\r\nthere are no liberalizing studies, aside from those of a professional\r\ncharacter. The faculty of the institute have insisted that such studies\r\nshould be incorporated to a considerable extent in the curriculum of\r\nevery course, recognizing the fact that few students in technical\r\nschools are graduates of colleges, and that the aim of the Institute\r\nshould be first of all to graduate broadly trained men. Aside from the\r\ncourses in liberal studies, a broad spirit is shown in the technical\r\ncourses themselves. The study of general principles is always the chief\r\nend in view, and to it are strictly subordinated the acquirement of all\r\nknacks, tricks of the trade or merely practical rules.\r\n\r\nThese characteristics of the Institute were impressed upon it\r\nfrom the beginning by the master hand of its founder and first\r\npresident, William B. Rogers. President Rogers aimed to establish ‘a\r\ncomprehensive, polytechnic college’ which should provide a ‘complete\r\nsystem of industrial education.’ It is now generally recognized that a\r\ncomplete system of industrial education would consist of three parts:\r\nFirst, manual training schools, for developing the eye and hand, not\r\nwith the object of producing artisans, but for training alone. Second,\r\ntrade schools for special training in the technique of the different\r\ntrades. Third, higher technical schools for training in the fundamental\r\nprinciples of the sciences, and fitting men in the broadest way to\r\nbecome leaders in the application of the sciences to the arts. Manual\r\ntraining is now generally recognized as a desirable addition to every\r\nscheme of public instruction and a powerful adjunct to every technical\r\nschool. It was not indicated in the original scheme of the Institute,\r\nbut was added in 1877 through the wisdom of President Runkle, as a\r\nresult of the exhibition in Philadelphia of the results obtained in\r\nRussia by instruction of this kind. Trade schools, for the training of\r\nartisans, were never included in the scheme of President Rogers, and\r\nare not now, either in America or Europe, considered suitable adjuncts\r\nto so-called technical schools, although they are very desirable\r\nas special and independent institutions. The original plan for the\r\nInstitute contemplated simply a school of the last-named kind, together\r\nwith provision for evening lectures, to which outsiders should be\r\nadmitted, and which it was expected would be of benefit to artisans;\r\nand also the establishment of a museum of arts, and of a society of\r\narts which should hold regular meetings and which should be the medium\r\nfor the communication to the public of scientific discoveries and\r\ninventions. It may be as well to state here that the museum of arts was\r\nnever established except in so far as the separate departments of the\r\nInstitute have accumulated collections; but that the society of arts,\r\nwhich held its first meeting in 1862, has been continued to the present\r\ntime. Many important inventions, as for instance the earliest forms of\r\nthe Bell telephone, were first publicly exhibited at its meetings.\r\n\r\nIn outlining his plan, President Rogers showed wonderful keenness and\r\nforesight. With the added experience of the succeeding forty years,\r\nit would scarcely be possible to make a more complete statement of\r\nwhat experience has shown to be the best method of organization. In\r\nfact, his Scope and Plan of the School of Industrial Science of the\r\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology may be said to be the first step\r\ntoward a new order of things in education, and contains the first clear\r\nstatement of the desirability of teaching physics, mining, metallurgy\r\nand other branches by the laboratory method.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE HENRY L. PIERCE BUILDING AND ENGINEERING BUILDING.]\r\n\r\nLet us now see what has been the result of the nearly forty years\r\nof development since President Rogers outlined his plan. Originally\r\nconfined to one building, the growing needs of the school have led to\r\nthe erection of five others, in addition to a gymnasium. The original\r\nbuilding, completed in 1865, is now known as the Rogers Building, after\r\nthe founder of the school; while the one next erected, in 1883, is\r\nnamed after the third president, the late General Francis A. Walker.\r\nThese two buildings each measure about 90 by 150 feet, and in addition\r\nto a building occupied by the Boston Society of Natural History,\r\noccupy one entire square nearly in the heart of the city, and in\r\nclose proximity to the Public Library and the Art Museum. Three other\r\nbuildings, which adjoin each other and now form one structure, are\r\nsituated about six hundred feet distant and form the front and part of\r\none side of what will some day be one large quadrangle. The first of\r\nthese buildings to be erected was the Engineering Building, built in\r\n1889, measuring 52 by 148 feet on the ground, adjoining which is a\r\nbuilding erected in 1892, 58 by 68 feet on the ground, and now forming\r\npart of the Engineering Building. Adjoining this is the Henry L. Pierce\r\nBuilding, erected in 1898, and measuring 58 by 160 feet. In addition to\r\nthese buildings are the workshops, about a quarter of a mile distant,\r\ncovering 24,000 square feet, and a gymnasium and drill hall.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ONE OF THE CHEMICAL LABORATORIES.]\r\n\r\nThe first laboratory to be established at the institute was that of\r\nchemistry, and this leads us to speak first of the department of\r\nchemistry. The laboratory of general chemistry was opened in 1876\r\nunder the direction of Professors Eliot[B] and Storer, and is believed\r\nto be the first laboratory where instruction was given in general\r\nchemistry to classes of considerable size. From small beginnings, this\r\ndepartment has rapidly grown under the able direction of such men as\r\nJames M. Crafts, (since 1897 president of the Institute), William\r\nRipley Nichols, Charles H. Wing, Lewis M. Norton and Thomas M. Drown,\r\nuntil now the instructing force consists of five professors, thirteen\r\ninstructors and six assistants, a total teaching force of twenty-four,\r\nin addition to seven or eight lecturers on chemical subjects. The\r\ndepartment occupies the two upper floors in the Walker Building,\r\ntogether with about half of one floor in the Henry L. Pierce Building,\r\ndevoted to industrial chemistry. The laboratories, which are said to be\r\nthe largest and best equipped in the United States, are known as the\r\nKidder chemical laboratories, having been so named in recognition of\r\nthe generosity of the late Jerome S. Kidder. They comprise twenty-two\r\nseparate laboratories, three lecture-rooms, a reading-room and library,\r\ntwo balance-rooms, offices and supply-rooms, making forty rooms in\r\nall, with accommodation for seven hundred students. Besides the large\r\nlaboratories for general chemistry and analytical chemistry, there are\r\nsmaller laboratories for volumetric analysis, for organic chemistry,\r\nfor sanitary chemistry with special reference to the analysis of\r\nwater and air, for oil and gas analysis, for the optical and chemical\r\nexamination of sugars, starches, etc., for the determination of\r\nmolecular weights, and so on. In the industrial laboratories, the\r\nstudents are taught how to manufacture chemicals with due regard to\r\neconomy of material, space and time. There is also a special laboratory\r\nfor textile coloring, with printing machines and all the necessary\r\nequipment of baths, dryers, etc., for experimental dyeing and coloring.\r\nIn this laboratory the preparation and use of coloring matters are\r\ntaught with the object of fitting young men for positions in dye works.\r\nA course of lectures in textile coloring was first introduced in 1888\r\nand the laboratory course in 1889.\r\n\r\n    [B] Now President Eliot of Harvard.\r\n\r\nA large amount of original work is accomplished each year in these\r\nlaboratories, both by students and professors. During the year 1897-98,\r\nfor instance, four books and sixteen articles on chemical subjects came\r\nfrom them. In the development of sanitary chemistry the Institute has\r\nbeen particularly prominent. Beginning with the careful and thorough\r\ninvestigations made by Professor Nichols for the State Board of Health,\r\nthe reputation of the institute in this direction has been still\r\nfurther increased by the recent extensive investigations of Professor\r\nDrown and Mrs. Ellen H. Richards, made for the same board in connection\r\nwith the examination of the purity of the water supplies of the State,\r\nand the experiments at Lawrence relating to the best methods for\r\npurifying water and disposing of the sewage of inland towns.\r\n\r\nAn illustration of the policy of the school in separating out a\r\nsubject whenever it is found capable of complete theoretical and\r\npractical treatment and putting it into the hands of some assistant\r\nprofessor for development, is found in the laboratory for gas and oil\r\nanalysis, which for some years has been in charge of Dr. Gill. In\r\nthis laboratory, investigations are made relating to chimney gases,\r\nas well as questions of fuel, furnaces, gas firing, etc., while oils\r\nare tested and analyzed with reference to specific gravity, viscosity,\r\nfriction, flashing and firing points, and liability to spontaneous\r\ncombustion. The same policy is further illustrated in the establishment\r\nin 1894 of a well equipped laboratory devoted entirely to physical\r\nchemistry; that is to say, to the relations between chemical changes\r\nand heat, light and electricity. This laboratory, under the charge of\r\nDr. H. M. Goodwin, occupies a room measuring 28 by 29½ feet, and is\r\ndevoted to photographic work, experiments in electrical conductivity,\r\nthermo-chemistry, molecular weight determinations and experiments\r\nin chemical dynamics. More recently still, a complete option in\r\nelectro-chemistry has been established, to meet a growing demand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PART OF THE ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING LABORATORY.]\r\n\r\nStill another illustration of the policy of specialization is afforded\r\nby the action of the Institute in establishing new courses of study,\r\nextending through the entire four years, whenever the need is felt\r\nfor men trained in a direction not hitherto specially provided for.\r\nThus, in 1888 a new course was established in chemical engineering.\r\nThe chemical engineer is not primarily a chemist, but a mechanical\r\nengineer--one, however, who has given special attention to such\r\nproblems as the construction of dye works and bleacheries, sugar\r\nrefineries, soap works, paper and pulp manufactories, fertilizer works,\r\nchemical works, and in general all the problems of chemical machinery\r\nand manufacturing. That this new course filled a real want was soon\r\nmade evident. The first class, that of ’91, contained seven graduates,\r\nwhile eighty-eight students in all have now been graduated and are for\r\nthe most part engaged in chemical works.\r\n\r\nThe physical laboratories of the Institute are now known as the Rogers\r\nlaboratories. Although they formed perhaps the central feature of\r\nPresident Rogers’ plan, financial and other exigencies prevented their\r\nbeing established when the school was opened. In 1869, Prof. Edward\r\nC. Pickering, then in charge of the department of physics, submitted\r\na scheme to the government of the Institute entitled ‘Plan of the\r\nPhysical Laboratory.’ This plan was adopted and carried out in the\r\nautumn of 1869 and has been in use ever since. It is worthy of remark\r\nthat the original statement of Professor Rogers with reference to\r\nlaboratory instruction in physics contained no mention of electricity,\r\nthen a subordinate branch, but one whose development since has caused\r\nit to occupy the leading place in any physical department. In 1882 the\r\ncorporation established a course in electrical engineering, setting an\r\nexample which has since been followed by almost every large technical\r\nschool, and founding a course destined in a few years to become one of\r\nthe largest in the Institute.\r\n\r\nAt present the department of physics and electrical engineering, under\r\nthe head of Prof. Charles R. Cross, has an active teaching force of\r\none professor, four assistant professors, six instructors and three\r\nassistants, a total of fourteen. In addition to these, there are\r\ntwelve lecturers on special topics, including many men eminent in\r\ntheir profession. The Rogers laboratories occupy sixteen rooms in the\r\nWalker Building, including two lecture-rooms and ten laboratories.\r\nAs in the case of the chemical department, these laboratories are\r\nhighly specialized. There is a laboratory for general physics, one\r\nfor electrical measurements, two rooms devoted to a laboratory for\r\nelectrical engineering, containing two distinct power plants driven by\r\nsteam engines of 100 and 150 horse-power, with a large number of dynamo\r\nmachines, transformers and a great variety of other apparatus arranged\r\nfor purposes of instruction, the mere enumeration of which would\r\noccupy several pages. Moreover, a lighting and power plant in the new\r\nbuilding on Trinity Place is available for experiments and instruction.\r\nBesides these, there are rooms for photometry, for heat measurements,\r\nfor acoustics, for optics and for photography. In fact, probably no\r\ndepartment of the Institute is more fully equipped than this, the\r\nwealth of apparatus being so great that the casual visitor is confused\r\nby the network of wires and machinery which surround him.\r\n\r\nThe interdependent and harmonious work of the various departments\r\nof the Institute is shown in the development of special lecture\r\nand laboratory courses, and is in marked contrast to the policy of\r\ndepartmental isolation sometimes practiced. Thus, in 1889, two new\r\ncourses of instruction were established by the physical department in\r\nresponse to the demand of the department of mining; namely, the course\r\nin heat measurements, including measurements of high temperatures,\r\nthe determination of the calorific power of fuels, etc., and a course\r\non the applications of electro-metallurgy to chemical analysis, the\r\nreduction of ores and similar problems. The equipment of calorimeters,\r\npyrometers, etc., in the heat laboratory is said to be so large as to\r\npermit a more complete examination of the efficiency of fuels than has\r\nhitherto been possible anywhere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SMELTING FURNACE IN JOHN CUMMINGS LABORATORY OF MINING\r\nAND METALLURGY.]\r\n\r\nPerhaps the greatest innovation made by the Institute in the early\r\ndays was in establishing a laboratory for the teaching of mining\r\nand metallurgy. Previous to 1871 metallurgical work was done in the\r\nchemical laboratories, but in that year the mining and metallurgical\r\nlaboratory was put into operation through the efforts of President\r\nRunkle, Professor Richards and Professor Ordway. Prior to this date,\r\nthere were assaying or metallurgical laboratories at the École des\r\nMines at Paris, the Royal School of Mines in London, the German\r\nMining Schools at Freiberg and Clausthal and Berlin, and also in\r\nseveral technical schools in this country. The German mining schools\r\nwere situated beside smelting works, but the plants could not often\r\nbe used for experiments by professors or students in a way to alter\r\nthe usual method of running. In all these laboratories, however, the\r\napparatus was designed to treat quantities of ore not exceeding a few\r\nounces for each test. The Institute laboratories were the first in the\r\nworld which were designed for the treatment of ores in economical\r\nquantities of from five hundred pounds to three tons, and used entirely\r\nfor purposes of instruction. They are now known as the John Cummings\r\nlaboratories, in memory of one who for many years was treasurer of\r\nthe Institute and one of its most devoted friends. They now occupy\r\nthe entire basement of the Rogers Building, and include laboratories\r\nfor milling, concentrating and smelting ores, as well as for testing\r\nthem by assay and by blowpipe. The development of these laboratories\r\nfrom the small beginnings of 1871 has been mainly due to the efforts\r\nof Prof. R. H. Richards, past president of the American Institute\r\nof Mining Engineers, whose contributions on methods of ore dressing\r\nare well known to mining engineers. The staff of this department\r\nalso includes Prof. H. O. Hofman, well known for his researches in\r\nmetallurgy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THREE STAMP MILL IN MINING LABORATORY.]\r\n\r\nMention should here be made of the department of geology, which is\r\nunder the direction of Professors Niles, Crosby and Barton, and\r\nwhich now occupies commodious quarters comprising the greater part\r\nof a floor in the Henry L. Pierce Building. The collections of this\r\ndepartment number many thousands, and are supplemented by those of\r\nthe Society of Natural History, which are available for purposes of\r\ninstruction. As would be expected in a school of applied science, the\r\neconomic aspects of geology are kept closely in view, and the work\r\nis adapted to the particular object to be attained. The student in\r\narchitecture, for instance, receives a course in geology in which the\r\nstudy of building stones is a prominent feature.\r\n\r\nAn engineering laboratory formed part of the original scheme of\r\nPresident Rogers, although he included it under the head of physics\r\nand did not anticipate the importance which has since attached to it.\r\nSuch a laboratory, especially devoted to engineering, was established\r\non a small scale in 1874, through the efforts of Professor Whitaker.\r\nAn engine for experimental purposes was presented to the institute\r\nby Mr. G. B. Dixwell, and this, with other apparatus, constituted\r\nwhat is believed to have been the first engineering laboratory in the\r\nworld for the regular instruction of classes. For lack of funds and\r\nspace, it was not much developed until 1882, but since that time it\r\nhas been brought to a high state of efficiency. To-day the engineering\r\nlaboratories, as they are called, which include laboratories of steam\r\nengineering, hydraulics, for the testing of materials and a room\r\ncontaining cotton machinery, occupy a floor space of 21,380 square\r\nfeet on the two lower floors of the Engineering and Pierce Buildings.\r\nIn addition to this, there are workshops which will be referred to\r\nagain. It would be tedious to enumerate the great variety of apparatus\r\nto be found in these laboratories, but a few important points may be\r\nmentioned. In the steam laboratory a 150 horse-power triple-expansion\r\nCorliss engine, the first of its kind of practical size ever arranged\r\nfor experimental purposes, was purchased in 1890 and is regularly used\r\nfor testing purposes. A second engine of 225 horse-power was added two\r\nyears ago, transferring its power through a rope drive. Besides these\r\ntwo large engines, there are a number of smaller ones for experimental\r\npurposes and the study of valve setting, and, in addition, there are\r\ngas engines, hot-air engines and other apparatus. There is also a\r\ncollection of cotton machinery sufficient to make clear to the student\r\nthe mechanism of the various machines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HORIZONTAL EMERY TESTING MACHINE OF 300,000 POUNDS\r\nCAPACITY IN THE APPLIED MECHANICS LABORATORY.]\r\n\r\nThe hydraulic laboratory is well equipped for the study of the laws\r\nof flowing water, having a steel tank five feet in diameter and\r\ntwenty-seven feet high, with a system of stand-pipes eighty-five feet\r\nhigh, reaching to the top of the building. This tank is furnished with\r\ngates and other apparatus suitable for experiments on the flow from\r\norifices, and connected with a system of horizontal pipes by which a\r\nlarge variety of other investigations may be carried on. Among the\r\nother apparatus of interest may be mentioned two impact water wheels,\r\nplaced in housings with glass sides so that the action of the water on\r\nstriking the buckets can be observed.\r\n\r\nSome experiments have already been made in the laboratory on the flow\r\nof air, the results of which have been communicated by Professor\r\nPeabody to the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. It is now\r\nintended to continue the study of the flow of air and its use as a\r\nmotive power in great detail, just as the flow of water is studied, and\r\nan air compressor of 100 horse-power, which will produce a pressure of\r\ntwenty-five hundred pounds, is now being installed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE 100,000 POUND BEAM MACHINE IN THE APPLIED MECHANICS\r\nLABORATORY.]\r\n\r\nThe laboratory for testing the strength of materials was established in\r\n1881 by Prof. G. Lanza, and has since been extensively developed under\r\nhis direction, until it is now one of the most complete in the world.\r\nIt is perhaps not too much to say that the experiments made in this\r\nlaboratory have in some respects revolutionized the ideas of engineers.\r\nPrevious to its establishment, the only tests of timber that had been\r\nmade were upon small selected specimens one or two inches square and a\r\nfew feet long. The results of these tests had been used for years by\r\narchitects and engineers, and they were given in all the engineering\r\nhandbooks. In the Institute laboratory there were conducted the first\r\nsystematic and extended tests of beams of commercial size. The results\r\nsoon showed that the strength of such timber was a great deal less\r\nthan previous tests on small beams had indicated, and the practice of\r\nengineers and architects has since that time been completely modified\r\nthrough the results obtained in this and similar laboratories. In this\r\nway does the work of such a laboratory become of direct and lasting\r\nvalue to the arts. The central piece of apparatus of the Institute\r\nlaboratory is the Emery machine, similar to the great machine at the\r\nWatertown arsenal, with a capacity of three hundred thousand pounds.\r\nBut in addition to this machine there are a dozen or more other\r\nmachines designed to test beams, columns, rope, wire and, in fact,\r\nmaterials of every kind and in every form. An interesting machine is\r\nthat for testing shafts in torsion, and it is instructive to see it\r\ntwist off with apparent ease a steel shaft three inches in diameter,\r\ntwisting the fibers before they break till the rod resembles a barber’s\r\npole. There are also beam-testing machines with capacities up to one\r\nhundred thousand pounds, in which not only beams but wooden trusses\r\nmay be tested to the breaking point. Some of the apparatus is of great\r\ndelicacy; for instance, one instrument will measure the twist of a\r\nsteel shaft two and a half inches in diameter and six feet long so\r\ndelicately that the effect of a twist given by one’s hand is distinctly\r\nvisible; scientifically speaking, it will measure an angle of twist of\r\ntwo seconds. There is also a machine designed for testing stone arches,\r\nhaving a capacity of four hundred thousand pounds and suitable for an\r\ninvestigation of many questions concerning these uncertain structures;\r\nalso machinery for studying the wear of brake shoes and wheel tires,\r\na subject in regard to which there is room for much investigation.\r\nFinally, mention should be made of machinery for investigating the\r\ninteresting subject of the effect of repetition of stress.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FORGE SHOP.]\r\n\r\nThe tests performed in the engineering laboratory cover almost the\r\nentire range of mechanical science. Sometimes investigations are\r\ncarried on through a number of years; for instance, during three\r\nsuccessive years experiments were conducted and formed the subject of\r\ntheses on the proper method of counterbalancing the reciprocating parts\r\nof a locomotive. Nor are the tests performed by the Institute students\r\nas a regular part of their instruction confined to these laboratories,\r\nas is made evident by the fifty-hour test of the West End Street\r\nRailway power station and the twenty-four hour test of the pumping\r\nengine at Chestnut Hill, both recently carried out.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the engineering laboratories, brief mention may be\r\nmade of the shops, which form an important adjunct of the laboratories.\r\nThey consist of a shop for carpentry, wood-turning and pattern-making,\r\nequipped with forty carpenters’ benches, thirty-six pattern-makers’\r\nbenches and a full equipment of saws, planers, lathes, etc.; a foundry\r\nwith a cupola furnace for melting iron, thirty-two moulders’ benches,\r\ntwo brass furnaces and a core-oven; a forge shop with thirty-two\r\nforges, a power hammer, vises, etc.; a machine shop with about forty\r\nlathes, together with drills, planers and all the other necessary\r\napparatus used in machine tool work.\r\n\r\nThe magnitude of the Institute laboratories is shown by the following\r\nstatements: The total horse-power of steam and other engines is nine\r\nhundred and eighty-three; the total capacity of tension, compression\r\nand transverse testing machines is over eight hundred thousand pounds,\r\nand of torsion testing machines about one hundred and fifty-six\r\nthousand inch pounds; the total horse-power of hydraulic motors is\r\nsixty-two; and the total capacity of pumps is thirty-two hundred\r\ngallons per minute.\r\n\r\nThe engineering laboratories are used by students of all the\r\nengineering departments, that is to say, by a large majority of the\r\nstudents in the school. The benefit derived by this actual contact\r\nwith materials and with machines of commercial size, under proper\r\ninstruction, is believed to be very great.\r\n\r\nThe department of mechanical engineering, one of the original\r\ndepartments, is now the largest in the school, having a force of\r\ninstruction of five professors and twelve instructors and assistants.\r\nAs an offshoot of it, a department of naval architecture was\r\nestablished in 1893, after a preliminary experience of four years with\r\nan option in this direction. This was the first course of its kind\r\nestablished in this country. It is somewhat remarkable, considering\r\nthe preëminence that America has long enjoyed in the building of ships\r\nand marine engines, that our technical schools should for so long have\r\nfailed to offer specialized instruction in these important branches.\r\nSchools devoted to these subjects have long existed abroad. The French\r\nGovernment School of Naval Architecture was established in 1865 for\r\nthe purpose of educating young men for the Government service. To\r\nthis school foreigners are admitted under certain restrictions. In\r\nEngland the first school of naval architecture was opened in 1871,\r\nbut no systematic instruction seems to have been provided until 1864.\r\nAt present, however, the Royal Naval College, at Greenwich, gives\r\nexcellent and thorough instruction to young men desiring to enter\r\nthe Government service. There has also been for a number of years an\r\nexcellent course of study in naval architecture at the University of\r\nGlasgow. The Institute of Technology established in 1888 an elementary\r\ncourse in ship construction, and this was followed in 1890 by a\r\nspecialized option in naval architecture extending through the four\r\nyears. Already forty-one men have graduated from this course.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHN D. RUNKLE, PRESIDENT, 1870-1878.]\r\n\r\nOne of the large departments of the school is that of architecture.\r\nForming one of the original departments established at the beginning\r\nof the Institute in 1865, when there was no similar department\r\nin this country, it may fairly be affirmed to have led in the\r\ndevelopment of instruction in this important profession. It was for\r\nmany years in charge of Prof. W. R. Ware, who left the Institute in\r\n1880 to assume charge of the newly established department at Columbia\r\nCollege. In common with the other departments of the Institute, that\r\nof architecture has developed enormously within recent years. Three\r\ntimes since 1883 has the department been obliged to change its location\r\nin order to meet the continued need of expansion. From the original\r\nsmall quarters in the upper floor of the Rogers Building, it has\r\ngrown so that it now occupies two and one half floors in the Pierce\r\nBuilding, besides a large room for modelling in another building. The\r\ndrawing-rooms now accommodate over two hundred students. The department\r\nhas a magnificent library and a very large collection of photographs\r\nand lantern slides. Under the careful management of Prof. F. W.\r\nChandler, who at the same time is head of the Architectural Department\r\nof the city and member of the Fine Arts Commission, it has now attained\r\na most enviable reputation. Institute students competed for several\r\nyears for the prizes offered by the New York Société des Beaux Arts,\r\nand in each competition in which they entered they carried off the gold\r\nmedal and the highest honors. In the three competitions of ’94-’95, no\r\nless than seventy sets of drawings were submitted by all competitors.\r\nThe two gold medals, four first mentions and two second mentions were\r\nawarded to Institute students. Of the nine designs sent from the\r\nInstitute, six were placed by the jury among the first eight of the\r\nseventy designs submitted; two received second place and one was put\r\nout of competition because of too great deviation from the preliminary\r\nsketch. This great success is doubtless due to the rigorous training\r\nwhich the students receive in architectural design at the hands of\r\nProfessor Despradelle, himself a graduate of the École des Beaux Arts,\r\na winner of high honors in Paris, and of the third prize in the recent\r\nPhœbe Hearst world competition for the new buildings of the University\r\nof California, and within a few weeks the winner of the first medal in\r\narchitecture in the Paris Salon of 1900. For three years the students\r\nare continually engaged upon architectural design, and the work of each\r\nstudent is examined and criticised before the class by a jury from\r\nthe Boston Society of Architects. Students in architecture have also\r\nthe opportunity, if they desire, of taking an option in architectural\r\nengineering, in which they are given a course in the theory and design\r\nof structures as rigid as that received by the students in civil\r\nengineering. The relations between architecture and engineering are\r\nexceedingly close and are becoming closer every year. The work of the\r\narchitect, aside from the æsthetic design of his buildings, is becoming\r\nmore and more like the work of the engineer, and requires a thorough\r\nknowledge of engineering construction.\r\n\r\nDuring the past year, after very careful consideration, the faculty\r\nhas also established an option in the course of architecture, devoted\r\nparticularly to landscape architecture, including, besides a large\r\namount of work in architecture proper, instruction in horticulture and\r\nlandscape design, on the one hand, and in surveying, topographical\r\ndrawing, drainage, etc., on the other hand. The landscape architect\r\nhas heretofore had no opportunity to secure a thorough training in\r\nhis profession, except by passing through an apprenticeship, as\r\nwas formerly necessary in the older professions. On account of the\r\nsteady increase in this country in the demand for trained landscape\r\narchitects and the increasing attention which is now being paid by\r\nour municipalities to questions concerning public parks, and also by\r\nprivate individuals to the beautifying of private grounds, there seems\r\nnow to be an unusual opportunity for young men to devote themselves to\r\nthis branch of the profession. As usual, the Institute of Technology\r\nis early in the field with a course designed to this end.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HYDRAULIC SURVEYING IN THE ESSEX CANAL, LOWELL.]\r\n\r\nThe last of the engineering departments to be considered and one of the\r\nlargest, is that of civil engineering, a department established when\r\nthe Institute was founded, and until 1881 under the direction of that\r\naccomplished scholar and teacher, Prof. J. B. Henck, and since 1887 in\r\ncharge of the writer. This department has grown since 1886 from four to\r\neleven teachers, and from sixty to one hundred and fifty-three students\r\nin the three upper classes. It now occupies the two upper floors of\r\nthe Engineering Building, or about twenty-three thousand square feet.\r\nIn recognition of the increasing importance of sanitary questions\r\naffecting the health of communities, a new branch of civil engineering\r\nwas recognized by the Institute in 1889 by the establishment of a\r\nregular four years’ course in sanitary engineering, in which particular\r\nattention is directed to such problems, and students are afforded\r\nopportunities of studying the bearing of chemistry and biology upon\r\nthem. Here again the breadth and specialization of the work at the\r\nInstitute was shown, rendering it possible with no change in the\r\nteaching force and with no disarrangement of studies, to establish such\r\na course of instruction as soon as the need for it became apparent.\r\n\r\nInteresting work has been done under the direction of Professor\r\nBurton, professor of topographical engineering, in connection with\r\nthe measurement of base lines with the steel tape. After devising\r\nan apparatus for holding and supporting the tape, and measuring the\r\ncoefficient of expansion of actual tapes, an application was recently\r\nmade of the thermophone for determining the exact average temperature\r\nof the tape. This instrument, which was invented a few years ago by two\r\nInstitute graduates, allows the average temperature of the tape to be\r\nmeasured within half a degree.\r\n\r\nAn interesting department of the Institute, and one that has of recent\r\nyears assumed great practical importance, is that of biology. It was\r\norganized in 1882, as an outgrowth of what was prior to that date\r\nthe course in natural history, and now has a teaching force of six,\r\nunder the direction of Prof. William T. Sedgwick, and occupies, with\r\nits laboratories and lecture-rooms, one entire floor of the Pierce\r\nBuilding. There are five distinct laboratories, fully equipped,\r\nwith private rooms, store and preparation rooms, and a library and\r\nreading-room, and it is perhaps safe to say that nowhere in the United\r\nStates is there so compact or well arranged a series of laboratories\r\ndevoted chiefly to the sanitary, hygienic and industrial aspects of\r\nbiology. The great advances in sanitary science in recent years have\r\nmade bacteriology one of the most important, as well as one of the most\r\npractical, of the biological sciences, and the biologist has taken his\r\nplace beside the chemist and the engineer in the study of the science\r\nand art of public sanitation. But bacteriology is of importance,\r\nnot only in sanitary science, but also in its industrial relations.\r\nGreat industries, like those connected with food preserving, canning,\r\nvinegar making, tanning and brewing, depend upon the activity or the\r\nexclusion of micro-organisms. As might be expected in a school of\r\napplied science, the development of the biological department in the\r\nInstitute has been mainly along sanitary and industrial lines, rather\r\nthan in the direction of zoölogy. The biological work in connection\r\nwith the recent important investigations of the State Board of Health\r\nregarding the purification of water and the disposal of sewage, was\r\ndone at the Institute, and early led to special instruction in these\r\ndirections. In 1894 a course was established in the micro-organisms of\r\nfermentation, not only new to the Institute, but, it is believed, to\r\nthe United States. Important researches had been made in Denmark in\r\nthese lines, and in order to become thoroughly familiar with them, one\r\nof the instructors of the department spent a summer in the laboratory\r\nof Alfred Jörgensen, in Copenhagen. In 1896, a more elaborate course,\r\nthat in industrial biology, was established, and since that time\r\nspecial studies have been made in various lines, such as the efficiency\r\nof sterilizing processes, the preparation of canned goods and the\r\ncultivation of butter bacteria. This department is destined to still\r\ngreater development in the near future, and its laboratories are finely\r\nequipped in every direction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FRANCIS A. WALKER, PRESIDENT, 1881-1897.]\r\n\r\nReference to the different departments in the Institute would not be\r\ncomplete without brief mention of its department of general studies. It\r\nis perhaps seldom recognized, but it is nevertheless a fact that the\r\nInstitute, although primarily a technical school, is better equipped\r\nfor giving instruction in languages, in history, in economics and\r\nstatistics and in political science than many classical institutions.\r\nIndeed, the only important department of study which is found in such\r\ninstitutions, and for which no provision is made at the Institute, is\r\nthat of ancient languages. The force of instruction in the department\r\nof general studies, leaving out of consideration the department of\r\nmodern languages, comprises two professors, one associate professor,\r\nthree assistant professors, one instructor and one assistant, a total\r\nof eight, probably a larger number than is found in any but the very\r\nlargest colleges. In the department of modern languages, there is one\r\nprofessor, one associate professor, one assistant professor and four\r\ninstructors. There are offered ten distinct courses in English, eleven\r\nin modern languages, eight in history and twenty in economics and\r\nstatistics and in political science. As already stated, it has been a\r\nfundamental principle in the government of the school that all regular\r\nstudents should receive a not inconsiderable amount of instruction in\r\nthese subjects, but in addition to the engineering and other technical\r\ncourses, there is a so-called course in general studies, designed to\r\ntrain young men for business occupations, in which, besides thorough\r\ncourses in chemistry, physics and other sciences, a large amount of\r\ntime is devoted to the general studies which have been referred to. The\r\nlate president of the Institute, General Walker, whose principal work,\r\naside from that relating to education, lay in the field of economics\r\nand statistics, took great interest in the development of this general\r\ncourse, and to him, more than to anybody else, is due its present high\r\nstandard. Seventy-eight young men have graduated from the department,\r\nand in many respects its course of study offers advantages over the\r\nusual college course.\r\n\r\nSummer schools are maintained by the Institute in the departments of\r\ncivil engineering, mining engineering and architecture. That in civil\r\nengineering affords continuous field practice in geodesy and hydraulics\r\nduring about a month. That in mining engineering affords students\r\nan opportunity to visit mining or metallurgical works and to become\r\npractically acquainted with the methods employed by actually taking\r\npart in them. These summer schools in mining and metallurgy have been\r\nheld in all parts of the country, from Nova Scotia to Lake Superior and\r\nColorado. The summer school in architecture consists not infrequently\r\nof a trip abroad, with detailed studies and sketches of special types\r\nof architecture.\r\n\r\nThe Institute also offers extended courses of free evening lectures,\r\nof which twenty courses of twelve lectures each were given during the\r\npast year. These courses, established by the trustee of the Lowell\r\nInstitute under the supervision of the Institute, correspond to one\r\nportion of President Rogers’s original plan, and are fully appreciated\r\nby young men who cannot afford the time for a complete and consecutive\r\neducation. The trustee of the Lowell Institute also established in\r\n1872, and has maintained ever since, a special school of practical\r\ndesign, under the supervision of the Institute, in which young men\r\nand women are given free instruction in the art of making patterns\r\nfor prints, ginghams, silks, laces, paper hangings, carpets, etc.;\r\nthe object being to fit them to engage in the textile industries\r\nespecially, but also in other branches of manufacture in which taste in\r\nform and color is an essential element for success.\r\n\r\nMention may be made here of the fact that all work at the Institute is\r\nopen to women on the same terms as to men. As early as 1867, among\r\nthe Lowell free courses, there were two chemical courses open to both\r\nsexes, and soon afterward women were admitted to the regular work of\r\nthe school. The first woman to graduate was Mrs. Ellen H. Richards, in\r\n1873, and since that time forty-eight women have received the degree.\r\nThis number, however, is no measure of the part which women have taken\r\nin the work of the school, for a large majority of those who attend are\r\nspecial students. During the year 1899-1900, there were fifty-three\r\nwomen studying at the school, principally in the departments of\r\nchemistry, biology, geology, physics and architecture. From the\r\nlast-named course eleven young women have graduated, one of whom was\r\nthe designer of the Woman’s Building at the Chicago Exposition.\r\n\r\nOne peculiarity of the Institute which has not been mentioned is\r\nthe sub-division of its libraries. Instead of having one general\r\nlibrary, each department has its special library, conveniently located\r\nwith reference to its rooms. This involves a slight duplication of\r\nbooks, but is of the greatest advantage to students and teachers\r\nfor consultation. The Institute libraries are not large, compared\r\nwith the libraries of many colleges and universities, but they are\r\nremarkably rich along the lines of the special topics to which they\r\nare of necessity principally devoted, and particularly in scientific\r\nperiodicals. The total number of periodicals in all languages regularly\r\nreceived at the Institute, not including a large number of official\r\nreports, is eight hundred and forty-seven. In the engineering library\r\nalone there are one hundred and seventy-three. It is believed that\r\nthis forms one of the largest collections of scientific journals to be\r\nfound anywhere. The Institute publishes a scientific magazine, known\r\nas the Technology Quarterly, which was established in 1887, and is\r\nthe official organ for the publication of the results of tests in the\r\nlaboratories and of special investigations by members of the staff\r\nand by students and alumni. The Association of Class Secretaries also\r\npublishes the Technology Review, a more popular quarterly, established\r\nonly two years ago, and devoted to the social and general interests\r\nof the Institute. In 1896 the Technology Club was started, occupying\r\na building near the Institute and affording alumni and students the\r\nsocial advantages of a clubhouse. The alumni of the Institute now\r\nnumber two thousand three hundred and thirty-nine; they maintain an\r\nAlumni Association which holds annual meetings, and seven local branch\r\nassociations which are scattered over the country from the Connecticut\r\nValley to Colorado.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JAMES M. CRAFTS, PRESIDENT, 1897-1900.]\r\n\r\nIn reviewing the success which this school has attained, the question\r\nnaturally presents itself: To what is this success due? Let me here\r\nrecord my conviction that it has been due mainly to the courage and\r\ndevotion of its corporation and of the presidents who have directed its\r\npolicy. In this respect no institution was ever more fortunate. With a\r\nguiding body possessed of the courage and faith that have animated the\r\ncorporation of the institution from the earliest days, and especially\r\nwith the able men who have been its presidents, success was assured.\r\nWhile the school was yet struggling for its very existence, with few\r\nfriends and little money, they never faltered. They have not hesitated\r\nagain and again to plunge the school deeply into debt when its needs\r\nrequired it, trusting to the generosity of New England that it should\r\nnot be allowed to be crippled, and each time has their confidence been\r\njustified. Poverty has never been permitted to impair the efficiency\r\nof the school. As President Crafts remarked in a recent annual report,\r\n“We are less favored than many neighboring institutions in building\r\nspace, but we have always followed the wise policy of keeping in the\r\nforemost rank and in some departments leading the way in supplying the\r\nbest methods and apparatus for teaching and for making investigation.\r\nWe have run in debt to buy them, and run still further in debt to\r\nbuild houses to hold them, but we have always had them when the head of\r\na department told the government of the school that they were necessary\r\nto the most efficient teaching of his science.” With a corporation\r\nacting on such a principle there could be no failure. It is true that\r\nthe faculty have stood unfalteringly, even in the darkest days, for\r\nhigh scholarship; and equally true that the school has been remarkably\r\nfortunate in the character of the young men who have sought its halls,\r\nbut no faculty and no body of students could have brought success\r\nwith a corporation less broadminded and courageous. Let me here add\r\nmy tribute to the work which was done by the late General Francis A.\r\nWalker, president of the institute from 1881 till 1897. Probably no\r\nsingle person did more to secure the success of the school than he.\r\nHis great administrative ability, his wide acquaintance, his accurate\r\njudgment of men, his magnificent courage and his splendid enthusiasm,\r\nwere factors in the development of the school whose importance it is\r\ndifficult to overestimate.\r\n\r\nGeneral Walker was succeeded by President James M. Crafts, who had been\r\nconnected with the Institute for many years as professor of chemistry,\r\nand under whose energetic administration the progress of the Institute\r\nhas been steadily continued. In fact, thanks to some unexpected\r\nadditions to the funds of the school, its material resources and its\r\nequipment have been more enlarged and extended during the past three\r\nyears than in many years previous. Only a few months ago, however,\r\nPresident Crafts, desiring to devote himself more uninterruptedly\r\nto the pursuit of the science which first awakened his enthusiasm\r\nand in which he has attained such eminent distinction, both in this\r\ncountry and abroad, decided to relinquish his office. The corporation\r\nhas chosen as his successor, Dr. Henry S. Pritchett, for many years\r\nprofessor of astronomy in Washington University, St. Louis, and for\r\nthe past few years superintendent of the Coast and Geodetic Survey at\r\nWashington. A more fortunate selection could not have been made, and\r\nthe well-known scientific and administrative ability of Dr. Pritchett\r\nwill no doubt be the means not only of maintaining the present high\r\nreputation of the school, but of extending and enlarging it.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the Institute is still unendowed in the sense that\r\nits receipts from invested property constitute but a very small part\r\nof the means required to carry on the school. To quote from one of\r\nPresident Walker’s reports, “No other institution of our size but has\r\ntwo, three or four times the amount of wealth to draw upon which we\r\npossess. It has only been exceeding good fortune, combined with extreme\r\ncourage, energy and self-devotion on the part of its trustees and\r\nteachers that has more than once rescued the school from paralysis,\r\nif not from extinction.” In 1898-’99, the total expenditures of the\r\nschool were about $367,500, while the current receipts were about\r\n$347,500, showing a deficit of about $20,000. Of the current receipts,\r\n$207,000, or 59 per cent, were from students’ fees. Dividing the\r\ntotal expenditures by the number of students, we find an expenditure\r\nof $314 per student, without counting interest on the value of land\r\nand buildings, while the tuition fee is $200. The invested funds of\r\nthe Institute amount to but $1,917,000. All gifts and legacies, with\r\nthe exception of this amount, have had to go into land, buildings and\r\nequipment. Between 1888 and 1899 the Institute has been obliged to\r\nspend $350,000 for land, the purchase of which has been a great burden,\r\nand within a few years a further expenditure of $260,000 in this\r\ndirection has been made.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HENRY S. PRITCHETT, PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE MASSACHUSETTS\r\nINSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY.]\r\n\r\nThe bearing of these figures will perhaps be realized by comparing them\r\nwith similar figures regarding Cornell University, which is largely\r\na technical school, since nearly one half of its students pursue\r\ntechnical courses similar to those in the Institute. In 1898 the total\r\nincome of that university was $583,000, of which about $121,000, or\r\nonly 20 per cent, was received from tuition fees. Its invested funds\r\namounted to $6,446,818.\r\n\r\nThe State has generously given aid to the Institute in some of\r\nits most trying times; as in 1888, when it gave $200,000, one\r\nhalf unconditionally and the other half for the support of free\r\nscholarships; and again in 1895, when it granted unconditionally\r\n$25,000 a year for six years and $2,000 a year additional for\r\nscholarships. Although the school has a very inadequate endowment, yet\r\nthe future looks bright. It is significant of the general appreciation\r\nof its work that men and women who have not received a technical\r\neducation have devoted a large part of their fortunes to providing such\r\neducation for others. Among the recent benefactors of the Institute we\r\nmay name Henry L. Pierce, John W. Randall, Mrs. Julia B. Huntington\r\nJames and Edward Austin, who, within less than three years have\r\nbequeathed nearly a million and a half dollars to the school. If the\r\nlarge gifts of recent years are continued, the school will before long\r\nbe put financially upon a level with its neighbors. May we not hope\r\nthat as the applications of science to the arts enrich the alumni and\r\nfriends of the Institute, they may help to make the road easy for their\r\nsuccessors by devoting a part of their riches to the advancement of\r\ntechnical education?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PSYCHOLOGY OF CRAZES.\r\n\r\nBY PROFESSOR G. T. W. PATRICK,\r\n\r\nUNIVERSITY OF IOWA.\r\n\r\n\r\nA well-known Washington newspaper correspondent, writing of the recent\r\nCongress of the Daughters of the American Revolution and its disorderly\r\nmeetings, says: “It is the unanimous opinion of those who have attended\r\nthe congress that, while the Daughters of the American Revolution,\r\nindividually, are nearly all intellectual, refined and attractive\r\nwomen, collectively they are an uncontrollable mob.” Why is the social\r\nconduct of human beings different from their conduct as individuals?\r\nThis is the problem of the new science of social psychology. The\r\nfollowing study of crazes and epidemics is offered as a slight\r\ncontribution to this science.\r\n\r\nBy way of preface it might be said that a good deal of the confusion as\r\nto the subject matter of social psychology would be avoided if it were\r\nunderstood that this science is not the study of any mysterious entity\r\ncalled ‘the social mind,’ nor the mere study of those individual traits\r\nthat make men social beings, such as imitation and suggestibility;\r\nbut rather the study of the peculiar and characteristic behavior of\r\nthe mind of the individual when under the influence of the social\r\nafflatus. Under this influence we do indeed find that he becomes a\r\ndifferent being, and that his mental processes must be formulated by\r\ndifferent laws; and we are convinced that, as thus understood, social\r\npsychology is just as distinct and legitimate a branch of study as is\r\nthe psychology of the child or the psychology of sex.\r\n\r\nNow, in what ways is the behavior of man as a social being different\r\nfrom his behavior as an individual? To answer this question in part,\r\nlet us examine his behavior in mental epidemics and crazes. I select\r\nthese because they illustrate in somewhat extreme form the influence of\r\nthe social afflatus.\r\n\r\nIf, for the sake of comparison, we first consider the normal individual\r\nas such, we find that he is a perceiving, remembering, associating,\r\njudging, reflecting, reasoning being; that he is subject to certain\r\nfeelings, emotions, desires and impulses, prompting him to action;\r\nthat his action is more or less deliberative, and, when it finally\r\noccurs, is the result of a set of motives determined by the man’s\r\ncharacter, which in turn is the outcome of his heredity and education\r\nand his general ability to appreciate and reflect the moral ideals\r\nof the social order to which he belongs. If now we study this man\r\nin respect to his mental development, whether from the savage or\r\nthe child, we find that the direction of change has been away from\r\nimitative, impulsive action, towards thought, reflection, deliberation.\r\nHe continually makes more use of memory and, anticipating the future,\r\nregulates his action in the light of his past experience. This change\r\nfrom the imitative and impulsive to the reasoning man accompanies the\r\ndevelopment of the higher brain centers, particularly of the cerebral\r\ncortex, upon which depend the all-important functions of memory and\r\nassociation. As an experiment it is quite possible to reduce this\r\nhighly developed reasoning being in a single moment to a condition\r\nresembling his primitive state by means of hypnotism. In hypnosis there\r\nis a temporary paralysis or sleep of the higher brain centers, upon\r\nwhich depends deliberative, rational action, and, the lower (older)\r\ncenters alone being active, the subject becomes a mere ideo-motor\r\nmachine acting out every suggestion. In various related states of\r\nautomatism, where there is any spontaneity at all, the mentality\r\nand morality of the subject are of a lower type and may be called\r\nreversionary in character, owing, no doubt, to the fact that those\r\nbrain centers which represent the most recent acquirements of the race\r\nare temporarily out of the circuit.\r\n\r\nIf again we study the mind of the child, we find that it presents many\r\npoints of likeness to the mind of the hypnotic subject and to the mind\r\nof the primitive man. We learn from biology that the child is to some\r\nextent a recapitulation of the life of the race, passing through in his\r\nindividual development the stages of race development. Physiologically\r\nspeaking, the higher brain centers and the centers for association,\r\nwhich are late acquirements of the race, are last developed in\r\nthe child. We are therefore not surprised to find that the child,\r\nlike the savage and the hypnotic subject, is imitative, impulsive,\r\nnon-reflective, incapable of much abstract thought, deliberation or\r\nreasoning, and that he acts with a view to immediate rather than remote\r\nends.\r\n\r\nIf now we turn to the behavior of the normal adult man in mental\r\nepidemics and crazes of all kinds, from the Crusades to the Massacre\r\nof St. Bartholomew, from the tulip mania in Holland to the Dewey\r\nwelcome in New York City, we observe that his behavior is to some\r\nextent similar to that of the hypnotic subject, and the child, and the\r\nprimitive man. The general character of mental action in epidemics\r\nis as follows: Men become imitative beings and their actions are\r\ndetermined by suggestion from the actions of others. Memory and the\r\nassociation of ideas are inactive, and there is an inability to reason\r\nand an indisposition towards deliberation and calm reflection. Past\r\nexperiences are disregarded, remote consequences are not seen and\r\nbehavior is impulsive and spasmodic. Feeling is very strong and every\r\nkind of emotion is apt to be exaggerated. Calm observation is also\r\nlacking and mental images may be mistaken for objective reality, as in\r\nthe case of the hallucinations that are frequent in these phenomena.\r\n\r\nThe moral peculiarities of an epidemic are of a similar kind. Under\r\nthe influence of a craze, the moral character of a people suffers a\r\nreversion to a primitive type. In times of epidemic waves the moral\r\nstandards of the crowd approach those of the savage. We observe\r\nthe exhibition of primitive instincts, such as cruelty, revenge\r\nand blood-thirstiness, together with changeableness, fanaticism,\r\nself-sacrifice and enthusiastic devotion to a leader. All these moral\r\ntraits were well illustrated in the Revolution crazes in France\r\nand in the persecution of witches in the sixteenth and seventeenth\r\ncenturies. Even in our own times a striking example of the primitive\r\ncharacter of the morality of a people under the influence of social\r\nexcitement was seen in the battle-cry of our American sailors in the\r\nrecent Spanish war, ‘Remember the Maine,’ the ethical motive being a\r\nprecipitate impulse to seek revenge. An instance like this can not be\r\nexplained upon the theory that it represented the actual individual\r\nmorality of the sailors participating in the battles, for it was echoed\r\nand apparently endorsed by the press throughout the country and upon\r\nthe platform and even in the pulpit. It is hardly conceivable that\r\nan Englishman of noble birth should openly boast of his joy in being\r\nrevenged upon an enemy; yet collective England is wild with delight\r\nwhen ‘Majuba Hill is avenged!’\r\n\r\nWe are thus led apparently to the theory that, for some reason not\r\nyet evident, under the influence of social excitement, something\r\ntakes place in the brain of the individual not unlike the action of\r\nhypnotism, by which the higher centers representing the more recent\r\nmoral and mental acquirements of the race are temporarily paralyzed,\r\nreducing the subject in a greater or less degree to the condition of\r\nthe child and of the primitive man. The observation of certain physical\r\nphenomena which often accompany mental epidemics tends to confirm\r\nthis theory and at the same time to suggest a possible explanation.\r\nEpidemics of the more extreme kind are apt to be accompanied by great\r\nmuscular excitability, varying all the way from mere extreme mobility,\r\nsuch as shouting, jumping and throwing the arms, to convulsions like\r\nthose of epilepsy. The dancing manias of the fourteenth and fifteenth\r\ncenturies furnish the best illustrations of this, although these\r\nphenomena did not equal in intensity the frightful physical convulsions\r\nduring the religious revivals in Kentucky at the beginning of this\r\ncentury. The particular character of these muscular movements is\r\ndetermined by imitation and suggestion. The movements themselves are\r\nno doubt due to congestion and irritation of the motor centers, or\r\nat least to a rapid overflow of nervous discharges at these centers,\r\nan accompaniment of the excessive emotion which attends all mental\r\nepidemics. In such a condition of the nervous system, thought,\r\nreasoning, memory and association can have little place, or, to\r\nexpress it physiologically, the unusual excitement in the lower\r\ncenters of the brain accompanying excessive emotion may not only find\r\nexpression in muscular movements, but may also exercise an inhibitory\r\nor paralyzing effect upon the higher centers, resulting in a kind of\r\nhypnotic condition. Neither is it difficult to understand the presence\r\nof this excessive emotion during mental epidemics or during any purely\r\nsocial movements, when we remember that war itself is the great\r\noriginal social movement, which even in this age always takes the form\r\nof a mental epidemic called the war spirit. The emotional effect of\r\nthe mere physical congregation of a large number of men, the emotion\r\nincreasing with the size of the assemblage, is known to all.\r\n\r\nAs we glance now at a few of the typical mental epidemics of history,\r\nwe shall notice the ever-recurring presence of some or all of the\r\nmental and moral traits that I have pointed out. For illustrations\r\nof these phenomena we may turn indifferently to ancient, medieval or\r\nmodern history. They abound at every period.\r\n\r\nVery good examples may be found in Hecker’s ‘Epidemics of the Middle\r\nAges.’ In the Crusades, particularly in the Children’s Crusades, we\r\nmay observe all the mental, moral and physical peculiarities that\r\nhave been mentioned. In the anti-Semitic mania, we see in its history\r\nof criminal horror the dehumanizing effects of the epidemic and the\r\nmoral reversion which takes place under the influence of social\r\nexcitement. The peculiar physical phenomena which have been referred\r\nto as characterizing epidemic excitement are best illustrated in\r\nthe dancing manias of the Middle Ages and in the religious revival.\r\nAlthough epidemic ‘revivals’ have occurred in all countries, some of\r\nthe best illustrations are seen in America in its early history and\r\nto some extent at the present day. At the time of the elder Edwards,\r\nrevivals were accompanied by fainting, falling, tremor and numbness.\r\nIn the Kentucky revivals the meetings, called camp meetings, were\r\nheld in the open air. The interest in them spread in true epidemic\r\nform. At the height of the excitement, as many as 20,000 people, men,\r\nwomen and children, were gathered in a single camp at one time. Dr.\r\nDavidson, who writes a history of this revival, says that “the laborer\r\nquitted his task, age snatched his crutch, youth forgot his pastime,\r\nthe plough was left in the furrow, business of all kinds was suspended,\r\nbold hunters and sober matrons, young men, maidens and little children\r\nflocked to the common center of attraction.” The emotional tension\r\nwas very great. A boy perhaps would spring to his feet and begin to\r\nrave, or some over-excited person would utter a piercing shriek, or a\r\ncry of triumph, and this would be the signal for a general hysterical\r\noutbreak, accompanied by many remarkable physical symptoms. Of these\r\nthe most common were falling in convulsive spasms, jerking, dancing,\r\nbarking like dogs, fainting, crying, singing, praying and cursing.\r\nSometimes whole companies were seized with uncontrollable laughing\r\nfits, called the holy laugh. At a meeting in East Tennessee, six\r\nhundred began jerking at one time. In many instances sensibility would\r\nbe lost and the extremities would be cold, while the face was flushed.\r\nIn some places the sufferers were laid out in rows and squares in the\r\nchurchyard until they should recover. From a medical point of view we\r\nshould call this epidemic chorea, but its more exact physiology I have\r\nalready referred to. When closely examined, the phenomena lose a part\r\nat least of their mysterious character. We must remember that religious\r\nemotions are powerful, deep and ancient. The effect, furthermore, is\r\nincreased by the general epidemic excitement, by the element of large\r\nand unwonted gatherings of people, by imitation, by the stimulating\r\nmusic and by the fearfully exciting power of human shrieks and wild\r\ncries and prayers. Such a nervous condition induced in an individual\r\nmust have two results: first, the escape of the unusual nervous\r\nexcitement in motor channels, giving rise to the choreic movements; and\r\nsecond, the paralysis of the higher brain centers, resulting in various\r\nhypnotic phenomena and reversionary morality and mentality.\r\n\r\nMany of these scenes were repeated in the great revival that swept\r\nNew York and the Middle States, beginning in the year 1832. In these\r\nmeetings preachers who kept cool and reasoned logically were not\r\nlistened to. There was rather a demand for the wild, impetuous,\r\nvociferous, physically impassioned oratory of the rude man. As an\r\nexample of reversionary morals in this epidemic, we may notice the fact\r\nmentioned by Albert Rhodes that in response to visions many men put\r\naway their own wives and took others from their neighbors.\r\n\r\nFrom the psychological point of view perhaps the most instructive of\r\nall epidemics is the demonophobia or witchcraft mania which raged from\r\nthe end of the fifteenth to the end of the seventeenth centuries. The\r\nsavage’s fear of demons and of unseen supernatural agencies lurking in\r\nevery forest and moor now took hold of the modern world and turned the\r\npeople, not into brutes and devils as we figuratively say, but simply\r\ninto the original savages from which they came, whose basal instincts\r\nthey still carried in their lower nervous centers, to be brought out\r\nunder the influence of a social craze. The ecclesiastical authorities,\r\nboth Roman and Protestant, led in this homicidal frenzy, while sedate\r\njudges, learned jurors and wise legislators lent their zealous aid. It\r\nspread in true epidemic form all over the Continent and into England\r\nand Scotland, even to America. Distinguished jurists declared that\r\nordinary methods of trial should not be used for this offence, for so\r\ndifficult is it to bring proof of the crime of witchcraft, that out of\r\na million of witches not one could be convicted if the usual course\r\nof justice were followed. One contemporary of undoubted authority\r\nwrote that he saw a list of three thousand witches that had been\r\nput to death during the time of the Long Parliament alone. In this\r\nreign of demonophobia the psychological phenomena of the craze are\r\nwell illustrated. The exciting cause was a widespread contagious and\r\nepidemic fear. The result was a recrudescence of the barbaric instincts\r\nof cruelty, torture and homicide, accompanied by a loss not merely of\r\nreasoning power, but apparently of common sense, so that intelligent\r\nmen seemed to believe that old women blasted the crops in the fields\r\nand the offspring of animals, and raised storms and whirlwinds. The\r\ncruelty characteristic of the savage is again noticed in this case.\r\nIn the witchcraft persecutions, the victims were commonly weak women,\r\nparticularly the more helpless old and young, while the character of\r\nthe inflictions was such as is peculiar to primitive people, viz.,\r\ntorture and burning alive. The perfidy of the savage is also noticed,\r\nas in innumerable instances the victims were led to believe that they\r\nwould be spared if they made a confession, and were then put to death.\r\nTo elude a legal requirement that torture should not be repeated, the\r\nmost horrible tortures were ‘continued’ from day to day.\r\n\r\nThe psychology of crazes is clearly seen in certain of its aspects\r\nin the homicidal manias that have swept over communities or whole\r\ncountries at frequent intervals in the world’s history. The homicidal\r\nimpulse itself is one of the most primitive and basal of all impulses.\r\nThe reason for this is apparent. The history of man has been a history\r\nof warfare and of struggle for existence. It has been man against man,\r\ntribe against tribe, nation against nation. Habits like these are not\r\nquickly unlearned, and reversion to them in times of social disturbance\r\nis not strange. In the massacre of St. Bartholomew we have a typical\r\ninstance of the homicidal mania. The necessary conditions were, first,\r\ngreat emotional excitement caused by religious fanaticism acting as\r\nan inhibitory agent upon the higher brain centers and allowing the\r\nprimitive impulses to act unchecked; second, the removal of external\r\nand customary restraints, effected in this case by the royal decree;\r\nand third, the mental effects of imitation and suggestion. These\r\nconditions being all supplied, the French people resolved themselves\r\nspeedily into assassins and cut-throats, and enjoyed a homicidal\r\ndebauch. Begun in Paris, the massacre spread in true epidemic form\r\nthroughout France, until fifteen or twenty thousand people had perished.\r\n\r\nThese homicidal manias have, of course, been very frequent in history.\r\nThe decivilizing influence of the craze is, however, most perfectly\r\nillustrated in the various scenes of the French Revolution. Here the\r\noverturning of the social and religious order itself acted in part\r\nas the unsettling and emotionally exciting cause. The usual results\r\nfollowed. The effect of social excitement in paralyzing the intellect\r\nwas shown in this case in the wholesale and useless destruction of\r\nwomen and children. Furthermore, this reversion to the manners of the\r\nsavage carries with it its appropriate mood. The slaughterers are not\r\nlike demons, as we imagine demons to be, but rather like thoughtless\r\nchildren. There is merriment and much gayety, and there is dancing and\r\nsinging around the corpses, and seats are arranged for the ladies, who\r\nare eager to enjoy the spectacle; and finally the victims are made to\r\npass through a double row of executioners, who carve them into pieces\r\ngradually, so that all can saturate themselves with the sight of the\r\nbloodshed.\r\n\r\nAlthough in some cases wars may be coolly planned by the people’s\r\nleaders for personal or political reasons or for purposes of national\r\nconquest, still they all depend for their successful issue upon the\r\nhomicidal impulse in the masses of people. This is called the war\r\nspirit and is always of an epidemic character. It may have any degree\r\nof ferocity or mildness. It has a tendency to be periodic, so that\r\nif it has slumbered for a considerable period a very slight cause is\r\nsufficient to awaken it. A mere boundary line in Venezuela, in which\r\nthis country had but a remote interest, was sufficient a few years ago\r\nto excite this war spirit in a milder form, when a curious craze for a\r\nwar with Great Britain flowed like a wave across this country.\r\n\r\nAny war will furnish instructive material to the student of social\r\npsychology. In the late Spanish-American war, for instance, we all\r\nfelt the war spirit which flowed in epidemic form across the country\r\nand engulfed it. The first motive of the war, the altruistic desire\r\nto free an oppressed people, was of the ideal glittering kind, well\r\nfitted to excite the emotions of the masses. A dramatic event further\r\nfans this emotional flame, and at once the aggregate personality of\r\nthe nation is in a condition of automatism, where primitive instincts,\r\nsuch as revenge and lust for the paraphernalia of war, are no longer\r\nchecked by the more lately acquired moral principles. Congressmen,\r\neditors, members of peace societies, ministers of the gospel, forget\r\ntheir long and patient efforts to establish means for settling national\r\ndifferences by arbitration and join lustily in the war cry, and the\r\npsychologically curious spectacle is presented of a great nation,\r\npriding itself as a leader in the world’s morals, giving to the appeal\r\nof a weaker nation for the arbitration of a dispute the answer of\r\nshot and shell. Although the motive of blood for blood is a moral\r\nmotive belonging to a bygone age and in individual ethics has long\r\nbeen outgrown, yet collectively, under the influence of the war craze,\r\nwe revert to it, and it is shamelessly proclaimed from platform and\r\neditorial room and vigorously applauded by the people. We have seen\r\nthat cruelty and the persecution of the weak by the strong were among\r\nthe reversionary symptoms of the social epidemic in many instances.\r\nWe may notice curiously enough a trace of these qualities here, where\r\nthe fact that our enemy was a greatly inferior power does not detract\r\nin our eyes from the brilliancy of our victories, though in the ethics\r\nof the individual such a circumstance would put us to shame. In all\r\nthis we proceed strictly in accordance with international law, but\r\ninternational law itself is only international custom and is the\r\nmere expression of the wonted behavior of the aggregate personality,\r\nparticularly in times of war. As such it does not represent the highest\r\nethical development of man, but that lower stage of development to\r\nwhich he reverts in times of social excitement. From this point of view\r\nit is possible to understand why international ethics is so far behind\r\nindividual ethics. Personal disputes were once settled by brute force\r\nas international disputes are now settled. There is no reason to doubt\r\nthat the latter will, somewhat later in the history of civilization, be\r\nsettled by courts of arbitration and enforced by a system of police as\r\nthe former now are.\r\n\r\nThe considerations now before us show the futility of peace congresses\r\nin that part of their work which contemplates the enforced substitution\r\nof arbitration for war. Peace congresses are not social movements. They\r\nspring from the efforts of individual men, leaders in social reform.\r\nThey belong to the upward ethical movements led by individuals, the\r\nslow, painful climbing towards higher moral and intellectual standards.\r\nThese congresses may meet and discuss arbitration and perfect an\r\ninternational program, but they labor in vain, for they forget that\r\nsocial man has a double personality and that the personality that meets\r\nand deliberates in the peace congress is not the personality that,\r\nunder the influence of the war craze, thrills with emotion and acts\r\nfrom ancient and deep rooted impulses and motives. When the war spirit\r\nsweeps over a country the social personality passes into a condition\r\nnot unlike that of hypnosis and is ruled by a different set of moral\r\nprinciples. It should not be understood from this that peace congresses\r\nare useless. They are a part of an educative system whose influence\r\nin the end will be strong enough to react upon the secondary social\r\npersonality and determine its behavior.\r\n\r\nAmong crazes of a different kind, we may notice financial crazes as\r\nan interesting type, falling under the same laws as those mentioned.\r\nBoth in panics and in speculative manias we observe again a species\r\nof hypnotization. In the case of the latter the ordinary business\r\nshrewdness which characterizes the dealings of the individual in a\r\nnormal state and which depends upon the activity of late developed\r\nassociation tracts in the brain, is to a large extent lost. The memory\r\nis impaired and what in general we may call prudence is lacking.\r\n\r\nThe psychology of the speculative mania is very simple. There is first,\r\ngreed, furnishing the necessary emotional excitement; then imitation;\r\nthen precipitate, unreasoning action. In the panic, the psychological\r\nsequence is the same, except that fear takes the place of greed. The\r\nstampede among animals may be taken as the type of all panics. It is a\r\nreflex phenomenon consisting merely of contagious fear and precipitate,\r\nunintelligent flight. Fear and flight constitute a most primitive form\r\nof mental action, equalled in primitive character only by that other\r\nform whose survival we have seen illustrated in wars and homicidal\r\nmanias, viz., anger and combat. Although the individual has long\r\noutgrown these simple reflexes, yet in social excitement he reverts to\r\nthem. The recrudescence of the first of these two forms is seen in the\r\ncase of panics in theatres and burning buildings, where social fear is\r\nfollowed by unintelligent flight, there being a temporary paralysis\r\nof reason, prudence, the power of choosing means to ends, respect for\r\nwomen and consideration for the weak and feeble.\r\n\r\nThe limits of this paper permit me only to refer to other forms of the\r\ncraze illustrating the same laws. In fads and fashions of all kinds,\r\nthe behavior of the social personality is different only in degree\r\nfrom that already described in the more serious epidemics. The law\r\nof imitation is the same, but there is less excitement and emotional\r\ndisturbance and consequently a lesser paralysis of the higher mental\r\nfaculties and a lesser return to barbaric impulses. Whereas the others\r\nmay be called forms of social paranoia, these may be called forms of\r\nsocial monomania. A single idea fills the public mind, and as a result\r\nthis idea is unduly exalted as to its importance and worth. The higher\r\nmental powers are paralyzed only so far as that there is a perverted\r\njudgment as to the relative importance of things and consequently\r\na more or less distorted view of the world and its values. Perhaps\r\nthe simplest form of this craze is seen in the epidemic character of\r\nchildren’s games. At different times of the season different games\r\ncompletely fill the social consciousness of the child-world, so\r\nthat for the moment there is no interest in any other game. New and\r\ninteresting sports, such, for instance, as golf, often fill the social\r\nadult consciousness in the same way. Then there are social and literary\r\nfads, crazes in musical airs, fashions in dress, furniture, houses and\r\ncarriages, without number. Crazes of all kinds have found a prolific\r\nsoil in America. The American mind is highly suggestible. One fad after\r\nanother rages over the country and in some cases reduces the aggregate\r\nmind to a condition of idiocy. The Dewey craze in New York City last\r\nyear is an illustration of this. Nothing but a sort of hypnotic\r\ndistortion of intellectual vision could cause grown men to stand in\r\nline for an hour in order that they might sit for an instant in the\r\nchair in which the hero sat during the review, or to fight for shreds\r\nof the flags and awnings that decorated the platform.\r\n\r\nSporadic social reform movements take the form of crazes and\r\nillustrate the same laws. One recalls the Woman’s Crusade in 1873,\r\nthe result not of a rational plan but of imitation, and the Granger\r\nmovement and the Farmers’ Alliance and the greenback craze and the\r\nsilver craze and many others.\r\n\r\nSince Aristotle we have been told that man is a social animal and that\r\nto study him as he really is we must not isolate him from society. The\r\nevident truth of this may lead us to forget that it is but a half truth\r\nand the uncritical acceptance of it will lead us wholly astray in our\r\nsociological study. The inference which we seem compelled to draw from\r\nstudies in social psychology is that social man is, in his ethical\r\nand intellectual development, many stages behind the individual man.\r\nThe progress of civilization is a slow, painful, upward climbing, in\r\nwhich individuals are the thinkers, the planners, the promoters and\r\nthe leaders. The mind of society, on the other hand, using the phrase\r\nin the sense defined, is an imitative, unreflective, half-hypnotic,\r\nhalf-barbaric mind, always acting as a drag upon the upward and forward\r\nmovement, and, in times of crazes, epidemics and social cataclysms,\r\ngaining temporary dominance and causing disastrous relapses to a lower\r\nplane of civilization.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME PHASES OF THE EARTH’S DEVELOPMENT IN THE LIGHT OF RECENT CHEMICAL\r\nRESEARCH.\r\n\r\nBY PROFESSOR EDWARD RENOUF.\r\n\r\nJOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the following pages an effort is made to apply some of the results\r\nof recent chemical research to the earlier history of the earth. It is\r\nhoped that the main facts brought out may be readily grasped by those\r\nwho have never studied chemistry, and that each link in the chain of\r\nevents will be made evident to those who have mastered the rudiments of\r\nthis science.\r\n\r\nChemical action involves change of composition. Substances more or\r\nless complex may be broken down into simpler substances, or from\r\nseveral simpler substances a complex substance may be built up. From\r\nthe complex ore of copper found in nature the simple element copper is\r\nobtained. From the elements sulphur and oxygen and the simple substance\r\nwater the complex sulphuric acid is built up. Within the last few\r\nyears the high temperature of the electric arc--the heat generated\r\nby a powerful electric current playing between two carbon poles--has\r\nbeen employed in bringing about chemical changes which do not occur\r\nat ordinary temperatures nor at those obtainable by burning fuel. The\r\nelectric furnace is used industrially to make calcium carbide from lime\r\nand coke, carbon silicide (carborundum) from coke and sand, and the\r\nmetal aluminum from its compounds.\r\n\r\nChemical changes at high temperatures have long been an object of\r\nresearch, but it was not until the introduction of the electric furnace\r\nthat it was possible to command temperatures high enough to make\r\nexhaustive studies. In the last few years several chemists, especially\r\nMoissan, of Paris, and his pupils, have done systematic work with the\r\naid of the arc furnace. The furnace used in the laboratory for high\r\ntemperature work is a small and simple apparatus; Moissan’s furnace is\r\na block of quick lime a little longer and wider than a page of this\r\nmagazine and about three inches thick. A rectangular cavity is cut\r\non the upper surface of this block. A similar block forms the cover.\r\nIn opposite grooves between the top and bottom piece are placed the\r\ncarbons, such as are used in ordinary arc lights. The arc plays across\r\nthe cavity in such a manner that the substance to be heated is not\r\nbrought into the arc itself, which is vaporized carbon, but below it.\r\nThe cavity thus represents a tiny reverberatory furnace; the arc heats\r\nthe roof and sides to an intense heat, which is radiated on the open\r\ndish or closed crucible or tube containing the substance heated. This\r\nis the simplest form of laboratory furnace. Various modifications\r\nare used, but in all the size is small and the arrangement simple. A\r\npowerful arc plays in the smallest possible cavity with the object\r\nof attaining the maximum of temperature, expense and duration of\r\nmaterial being secondary considerations. Lime and magnesia are the\r\nbest materials, because they are at the same time the most refractory\r\nsubstances available and are poor conductors of heat. A furnace top\r\none and one half inches thick may be heated by so powerful an arc that\r\nthe melted quick lime drips from the inner surface, while the outer\r\nsurface is scarcely warm to the touch of the hand. Moissan has utilized\r\nin these little furnaces currents of electricity of varied strength,\r\nthe lowest being that given by a four horse-power dynamo, the highest\r\nthat generated by three hundred horse power. The highest temperatures\r\nobtained were about 3,500° centigrade (6,300° Fahrenheit), with the\r\nheat constantly increasing; the limit to the obtainable temperature--as\r\nfar as the experimental evidence showed--was merely the lack of\r\nany known substance refractory enough to bear the heat; for at the\r\ntemperature mentioned quick lime and magnesia not only melt but are\r\nchanged into gases, so that the furnace was filled with the vapors of\r\nits own material.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the heat on single substances is very interesting.\r\nRefractory metals, such as iron, manganese, uranium, platinum, melt\r\nrapidly and then become gaseous; the most refractory non-metallic\r\nelements, silicon, boron, carbon, are also changed into the gaseous\r\nform. Very refractory compounds are broken down into simpler ones.\r\nMagnesium pyrophosphate yields phosphorus, magnesium oxide and oxygen.\r\nAsbestos--a magnesium silicate--gives as chief product magnesium\r\nsilicide; the other substances formed being silicon, silicon dioxide\r\nand a little magnesium oxide.\r\n\r\nSuch are the astounding changes wrought by simple heat upon those\r\nsubstances which we are accustomed to regard as infusible. It must\r\nbe remembered that the range of temperature which chemists employ in\r\nordinary laboratory work is not very great and that the conditions of\r\nwork in the laboratory and of nature’s work on the earth’s surface at\r\nthe present day favor the formation of two classes of compounds--the\r\noxides and their hydrates. Although air is a mixture consisting mainly\r\nof four parts of nitrogen and one of oxygen, atmospheric nitrogen is\r\ngenerally inert at ordinary temperatures, and it is the oxygen of the\r\nair which is the more important factor in the growth of living things\r\nand in changes in lifeless matter. Water, a compound of oxygen and\r\nhydrogen, is present everywhere, either in the liquid form or as vapor\r\nin the air; even in the flame of the hottest fires there is water vapor\r\nin abundance, since water is one of the chief products of combustion\r\nof most forms of fuel. Is it a wonder that under such conditions we\r\nfind the earth’s crust to contain the elements chiefly compounded\r\nwith oxygen? Was this always so? Are we justified in supposing that\r\nconditions may have prevailed--nay, must have prevailed--in former\r\ntimes on the earth’s surface, which gave to other elements as important\r\nor more important functions than to oxygen? The answer to these\r\nquestions must be sought in the results of the chemistry of high\r\ntemperatures.\r\n\r\nFirst let us consider the conditions of existence of the omnipresent\r\nwater. Water begins to break down into its components, hydrogen and\r\noxygen, at 934° centigrade; at 2,500° centigrade (4,500° Fahrenheit)\r\nthe decomposition is complete. In other words, water vapor cannot exist\r\nat temperatures above 2,500°, but the hydrogen and oxygen exist in the\r\nfree state.\r\n\r\nAstronomers tell us that refractory elements like iron, silicon and\r\ncarbon, perhaps disassociated into still simpler substances, are\r\npresent as vapor in the atmosphere of the sun and that many others of\r\nour well-known elements, including hydrogen, are also present in this\r\nglowing atmosphere, while the heat of the sun’s surface and that of\r\nthe hotter stars is vastly higher than that of the electric furnace.\r\nGeologists believe that the evidence at their disposal points to a\r\nsimilar period of great heat in the early history of the earth. It\r\nmay be considered, then, that temperatures higher than those of the\r\nelectric furnace prevailed in former times on the earth’s surface.\r\n\r\nLet us now return to the study of the results obtained with the\r\nelectric furnace. The following reactions are especially important. If\r\nmetals, or refractory non-metals, or metallic or non-metallic oxides,\r\nor complex silicates, are heated to the higher temperatures in contact\r\nwith carbon, boron, silicon or compounds of these three elements with\r\noxygen, the result generally is that very refractory carbides, borides\r\nor silicides of the metals or non-metals are formed. In other words,\r\nthose complex substances which form the chief constituents of the\r\nouter crust of the earth at the present day are decomposed at high\r\ntemperatures, and simple compounds of two elements--so-called binary\r\ncompounds--are formed. Four classes of these binary substances seem to\r\nbe especially stable at high heat--the carbides, borides, silicides and\r\noxides; but the oxygen of the metallic oxides tends to pass off as an\r\noxide of carbon, if carbon be present.\r\n\r\nAt somewhat lower temperatures nitrogen is very active and the nitrides\r\nof many metals are readily formed. An excellent example is shown by\r\nheating a mixture of carbon and of an oxide of titanium (titanic acid).\r\nWhen heated by a feeble current the acid is simply reduced, forming\r\na lower oxide of titanium; with a more powerful current the mass is\r\ncompletely changed into the nitride of titanium, the nitrogen coming\r\nfrom the air; with a very powerful current this is changed into pure\r\ncarbide, as the nitride cannot exist at the higher temperature, and the\r\nnitrogen escapes, carbon taking its place. At still higher temperatures\r\nhydrogen acts on many metals, forming hydrides. The carbides and other\r\ncompounds of some metals are not stable at high temperatures, being\r\nreduced by gaseous carbon to the free metals, which remain then in the\r\ngaseous form.\r\n\r\nAt that period of the earth’s history when the temperature was as high\r\nas that easily obtained in the electric furnace, we have the sanction\r\nof geologists for picturing the earth’s surface as an ocean of molten\r\nmatter surrounded by a glowing atmosphere. This molten surface must\r\nhave consisted of binary compounds such as those mentioned above, and\r\nprobably contained some refractory elements, metals and non-metals,\r\nin the free state. The atmosphere contained free hydrogen, oxygen\r\nand nitrogen, gaseous binary compounds like the oxides of carbon,\r\nmetals in the gaseous form and many non-metallic elements like sulphur\r\nand chlorine. In the atmospheric region furthest removed from the\r\nmolten surface violent chemical reactions occurred between the heated\r\nelements, forming compounds which were again dissipated into their\r\nelements by the heat given off in the act of formation or radiated from\r\nthe glowing surface below.\r\n\r\nUnder the enormous pressure of this atmosphere the liquid surface of\r\nthe earth solidified at very high temperature. Whether the earth’s\r\nmass solidified from the centre outward or by forming a solid crust\r\nover a liquid interior, is a question to be decided by physicists and\r\ngeologists. We will consider only the outer crust and the atmosphere.\r\nAs the surface and the atmosphere above it gradually cooled, the\r\nformation of nitrides, and later of hydrides, sulphides and chlorides,\r\noccurred.\r\n\r\nThe conditions now attained may have been fairly stable as long as\r\nthe temperature of the surface and lower regions of the atmosphere\r\nwere high enough to prevent the union of the atmospheric oxygen and\r\nhydrogen, or to decompose the water forming in the outer regions of\r\nthe atmosphere. As soon, however, as by further cooling, water came\r\ninto contact with the earth’s surface, very violent reactions occurred,\r\nwhich were supplemented by other equally violent reactions when the\r\ncooling process permitted the formation of the ordinary mineral acids.\r\n\r\nThe reactions of water and of acids on many of the binary compounds\r\nare so important in determining the present composition of the\r\nearth’s crust that they must be considered in detail. The carbides,\r\nnitrides, chlorides, sulphides and hydrides of most elements, and some\r\nsilicides, are decomposed by water, or else by dilute acids, forming\r\nthe hydrogen compounds of carbon, nitrogen, chlorine, sulphur and\r\nsilicon respectively, and the oxide or hydroxide of the other element.\r\nThus calcium carbide and water give calcium hydroxide and acetylene,\r\na hydro-carbon. Aluminum carbide yields alumina and methane (marsh\r\ngas), another hydro-carbon, the chief constituent of ‘natural gas.’\r\nOther carbides yield crude petroleum. The nitrides yield ammonia, which\r\nis the hydrogen composed of nitrogen. The chlorides give hydrochloric\r\nacid, the sulphides sulphuretted hydrogen and the silicides the\r\nhydrogen silicide. The metallic hydrides yield free hydrogen.\r\n\r\nThe violence and the magnitude of some of these reactions almost baffle\r\nthe imagination. Let the reader drop a piece of calcium carbide as\r\nlarge as a small marble into a little water in a cup; there is a rapid\r\naction, a gas (acetylene) is given off, which burns with a smoky flame\r\nif a lighted match is held over the cup. (The experiment should be\r\ntried in the open air.) So much heat is generated in the reaction that\r\nthe cup becomes hot. Nearly four per cent. of the earth’s outer crust\r\nis calcium; all this was at this period of the earth’s history in the\r\nform of carbide. Imagine all the vast limestone mountain ranges of\r\nthe present day as carbide, and try to realize the effect when water\r\nfell on any considerable area. The heat generated would be so enormous\r\nthat in a moment the acetylene would ignite and burn, forming oxides\r\nof carbon and water vapor, which would in turn decompose, throwing the\r\njets of glowing hydrogen and oxygen vast distances into the atmosphere,\r\nthere to cool and reunite to water. The decomposition of other\r\ncarbides, of the hydrides and silicides, as well as the formation of\r\nhydroxides by the action of the lighter metals on water, would produce\r\nsimilar phenomena, as the substances formed are combustible gases, or\r\nliquids or solids easily volatilized. This is no wild fantasy, but\r\na conservative statement. Similar reactions are taking place at the\r\npresent day in those stars whose cooling process has advanced far\r\nenough; a case in point is that of the so-called ‘temporary stars.’\r\n\r\nExtremely violent reactions are taking place constantly in the\r\natmosphere of the sun. The sun’s chromosphere, or outer layer of its\r\natmosphere, consists mainly of hydrogen, and jets of glowing hydrogen\r\nare thrown to great heights above the chromosphere; these jets or\r\n‘prominences’ have been frequently observed to have a height of 100,000\r\nmiles, and prominences of more than double this height are reported\r\nby observers. The most conservative estimates assume temperatures of\r\nthe sun’s surface so enormous that that of the electric furnace is\r\ninsignificant in comparison, and we can have no conception of the\r\nchemical changes occurring under such conditions. Whether one believes,\r\nwith Lockyer, that the chemical ‘elements’ are disassociated by the\r\nsun’s heat into simpler substances or not, it is clear that very\r\nviolent chemical reactions are in progress, and if we realize that\r\nthe known chemical reactions increase in intensity with increase in\r\ntemperature, it does not seem strange that at the sun’s temperature the\r\nreactions occurring should cause disturbances like those observed.\r\n\r\nReturning to the earth, let us consider the products of these violent\r\nreactions. The hydrogen and hydrides of boron, silicon, sulphur and\r\ncarbon, combined with the oxygen of the atmosphere, forming water and\r\nboric, silicic, sulphurous and carbonic acids, which in turn acted on\r\nthe metallic oxides and hydroxides, forming sulphites, carbonates,\r\nborates and simple and complex silicates; some quickly, some slowly,\r\nsome at low temperatures and atmospheric pressure, others at high\r\ntemperatures in liquid or semi-liquid condition and under the pressure\r\nof rock masses above. To determine the relative age of existing rock\r\nlayers, or the mode of their formation, whether by eruptive action, by\r\nsurface heat, by deposition of finely divided material under water,\r\nor by metamorphic changes of the cooled silicate under subsequent\r\naction of water, pressure and heat, is the province of the geologist.\r\nThe present writer refrains from an opinion whether any of the first\r\nformed solid crust could or could not survive to the present day in\r\nits primary form, considering the exposure to water, acids, heat and\r\npressure which it suffered.\r\n\r\nYet an idea may be formed of the condition of the earth’s surface when\r\nit had cooled so far that the more violent chemical action had ceased.\r\nIt consisted chiefly of silicates, simple and complex; of some of\r\nthe original binary compounds, which are scarce affected by water or\r\nacids, such as the silicide of carbon (carborundum), of stable oxides,\r\nchlorides and sulphides, with other compounds in smaller proportion,\r\nand free elements in greater proportion than at the present day.\r\nEverywhere, from crevices in the surface, hydrocarbons, phosphoretted\r\nhydrogen (phosphine) and ammonia were issuing as gases; the atmosphere\r\nwas heavy with these gases and with carbon dioxide.\r\n\r\nNo scientific observations thus far show _how_ or from what definite\r\ncompounds plant life or animal life was first evolved from lifeless\r\nmatter; but it is certain that the materials were much more abundant\r\nand the conditions more favorable at the period when it _was_ evolved\r\nthan at the present day. An ocean much warmer and less saline than now,\r\na damp atmosphere like that of a hothouse, an abundance of plant food\r\nand a choice of raw material, were at hand. The chief foods required\r\nfor plant life are nitrogen in the form of ammonia or nitrates, carbon\r\ndioxide, phosphorus as phosphates, sulphates of lime, of magnesia\r\nand of the alkalies, and water. As to the raw material for the first\r\nformation of the living cell, it is impossible to say what compounds\r\nof carbon were employed; suffice it to note that the known simple\r\nand complex binary compounds of carbon were there ready for use; the\r\nhydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide were oozing from the\r\nearth’s surface, from the ocean floor as well as from the land, or\r\nhanging heavy in the air above it. If warmth or increased pressure\r\nwere desiderata, an ocean warm to its greatest depths could afford\r\nany pressure required. From the decomposition of the nitrides and\r\nphosphides below the surface, ammonia and phosphine were escaping into\r\nthe ocean and into the air. The conditions then during long periods\r\nof time were especially favorable for marine life, and as sand and\r\nmud accumulated on the rocky surface of the earth, for land plants;\r\nthe absence of a thick soil being more than compensated for by the\r\nabundance of plant food, notably of carbon dioxide and ammonia.\r\n\r\nThe statement may be found in excellent modern text-books of chemistry\r\nthat ammonia is always formed by the decomposition of plants and\r\nanimals, accompanied by the further statement that ammonia is a\r\nrequisite for plant food. No plants--no ammonia; no ammonia--no plants.\r\nIf this were true, the beginning of plant life would indeed have been\r\na struggle for existence; that it is not true is shown above. This\r\ndecomposition of nitrides has ceased practically on the actual surface\r\nof the earth at the present day because the nitrides have all been\r\ndecomposed; yet it may be mentioned that specimens of rock freshly\r\nquarried in Sweden were recently found to give off ammonia when wet\r\nwith water, showing the presence of nitrides. Below the actual earth’s\r\nsurface it is probable that nitrides still exist in large quantity,\r\nfor ammonia is one of the constituents of volcanic gases; to believe\r\nthat volcanic ammonia is a product of plant or animal decomposition is\r\ndifficult; to suppose it formed by the action of steam on nitrides in\r\nthe earth’s interior is simple.\r\n\r\nMuch the same may be said of the presence of carbides. While they no\r\nlonger exist on the surface, there is no doubt of their existence\r\nin the interior of the earth, and the volcanic gases contain their\r\ndecomposition products. In this connection the theory--first put\r\nforward by Mendelèeff and since supported by Moissan--of the origin\r\nof petroleum, may be mentioned. These writers favor the hypothesis\r\nthat it was formed by the decomposition of carbides by water under\r\npressure; and while the evidence at hand perhaps favors the belief\r\nthat the petroleum of the more important oil fields owes its origin to\r\ndecomposition of the lower forms of marine animal life, yet there can\r\nbe no doubt that petroleum may be formed by carbide decomposition, and\r\nit seems probable that natural gas is in part at least a result of the\r\nsame action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA PRELIMINARY ACCOUNT OF THE SOLAR ECLIPSE OF MAY 28, 1900, AS OBSERVED\r\nBY THE SMITHSONIAN EXPEDITION.\r\n\r\nBY DR. S. P. LANGLEY,\r\n\r\nSMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nPartly in deference to the report of the United States Weather Bureau,\r\nfrom which it appeared that the chance of a fair eastern sky on the\r\nmorning of the eclipse was about 8 to 1, and after examination by Mr.\r\nAbbot of many stations in North Carolina, Wadesboro, of that State, was\r\nselected early in April as the site of the Smithsonian observations.\r\nThe advantages of Wadesboro being also recognized by Professor Young,\r\nof Princeton, Professor Hale, of Yerkes Observatory, and the Rev. J.\r\nM. Bacon, of the British Astronomical Association, it came about that\r\nfour large observing parties, besides several smaller ones and numerous\r\nexcursionists from the surrounding country, were all joined to produce\r\nat Wadesboro one of the largest company of eclipse observers ever\r\nassembled for scientific purposes. It is a matter for congratulation\r\nthat the sky at Wadesboro upon the day of the eclipse was cloudless\r\nand clearer than the average, so that the efforts of the observing\r\nforces were not thwarted by any circumstances beyond their control. The\r\nprovisions of the Mayor and authorities of Wadesboro for preventing\r\nintrusion before and during the eclipse, and thus securing an\r\nundisturbed field of operations, deserve especial recognition. Further\r\nthan this, the many acts of courtesy and hospitality to the visiting\r\nastronomers on the part of the townspeople will long be remembered by\r\nthe recipients.\r\n\r\nThe Smithsonian party proper consisted of thirteen observers,\r\nand included Mr. Langley, Mr. Abbot, aid acting in charge of the\r\nSmithsonian astrophysical observatory; Mr. Smillie, in charge of\r\nphotography; Mr. Putnam, of the United States Coast Survey; Mr. Fowle,\r\nMr. Mendenhall, Mr. Child, Mr. Draper, Mr. Gill, Mr. Kramer and Mr.\r\nSmith. Included with these, the Rev. Father Searle and the Rev. Father\r\nWoodman gave most valuable assistance. Mr. Hoxie, of Port Royal, S. C.,\r\nand Mr. Little, of Wadesboro, rendered valued assistance to Mr. Putnam\r\nduring totality.\r\n\r\nProfessor Hale, of the Yerkes Observatory, was a member of the party,\r\nwhile still in general charge of the Yerkes expedition, and his\r\ncounsel and aid were of the greatest service. Mr. Clayton, of Blue\r\nHill Meteorological Station, occupied a part of the grounds of the\r\nSmithsonian party.\r\n\r\nThe main object of investigation was, of course, the corona, and of\r\nthis, (first) a photographic and visual study of its structure; with,\r\n(second) a determination by the bolometer whether appreciable heat\r\nreaches us from it, and, if possible, an examination of the form of its\r\nspectrum energy curve.\r\n\r\nThe writer had been particularly struck, when observing the eclipse\r\nof 1878 on Pike’s Peak, by the remarkable definiteness of filamentary\r\nstructure close to the sun’s limb, and had never found in any\r\nphotographs, not even in the excellent ones of Campbell taken at the\r\nIndian eclipse of 1898, anything approaching what he saw in the few\r\nseconds which he was able to devote to visual observations at the\r\nheight of fourteen thousand feet. His wish to examine this inner\r\ncoronal region with a more powerful photographic telescope than any\r\nheretofore used upon it, was gratified by the most valued loan by\r\nProf. E. C. Pickering of the new 12-inch achromatic lens of 135 feet\r\nfocus, just obtained for the Harvard College Observatory. This lens,\r\nfurnishing a focal image of more than 15 inches diameter, was mounted\r\nso as to give a horizontal beam from a cœlostat clock-driven mirror by\r\nBrashear, of 18 inches aperture, and used with 30-inch square plates.\r\nTo supplement this great instrument, a 5-inch lens of 38-feet focus,\r\nloaned by Professor Young, was pointed directly at the sun. This\r\nformed images upon 11 × 14 plates moved in the focus of the lens by a\r\nwater clock. Specially equatorially mounted lenses of 6, 4 and 3-inch\r\naperture, driven by clock work, were provided for the study of the\r\nouter corona, and the search for possible intra-mercurial planets.\r\n\r\nFor the bolometric work, the massive siderostat with its 17-inch\r\nmirror, and a large part of the delicate adjuncts employed at the\r\nSmithsonian Institution in recent years, to investigate the sun’s\r\nspectrum, was transported to Wadesboro. The excessively sensitive\r\ngalvanometer reached camp without injury even to its suspending fibre,\r\na thread of quartz crystal 1-15,000 inch in diameter.\r\n\r\nBesides these two chief aims (the photography and bolometry of the\r\ninner corona), several other pieces of work were undertaken, including\r\nthe automatic reproduction of the ‘flash spectrum’ by means of an\r\nobjective prism with the 135-foot lens, the photographic study of the\r\nouter coronal region, including provision for recognizing possible\r\nintra-mercurial planets, already alluded to, visual and photographic\r\nobservations of times of contact, and sketches of the corona, both from\r\ntelescopic and naked-eye observations.\r\n\r\nThe assignment of the observers was as follows: Mr. Langley, in general\r\ncharge of the expedition, observed with the same 5-inch telescope used\r\nby him on Pike’s Peak in 1878, which was most kindly lent for this\r\nspecial comparison by Professor Brown, of the United States Naval\r\nObservatory; C. G. Abbot, aid acting in immediate charge, assigned\r\nwith C. E. Mendenhall to the bolometer; T. W. Smillie, having general\r\ndirection of the photographic work, made exposures at the 135-foot\r\ntelescope; F. E. Fowle, Jr., assigned to the 38-foot telescope; Father\r\nSearle, directing the assembled telescopes for the outer coronal\r\nregion, and for intra-mercurial planets, assisted by P. A. Draper\r\nand C. W. B. Smith, exposed two cameras of 3-inch aperture and 11\r\nfeet focus, and two of 4½-inch aperture and 3½ feet focus, all four\r\nof these telescopes being mounted on a single polar axis driven by\r\nan excellent clock; De Lancey Gill, assisting Mr. Smillie, removed\r\nthe flash spectrum objective prism at second contact, and made a\r\nsingle long exposure with a 6-inch photographic lens of 7½ feet focus\r\nequatorially mounted; Assistant G. R. Putnam, who, by the kindness of\r\nthe superintendent of the United States Coast Survey, was detailed\r\nfor latitude,[C] longitude[D] and time observations, also observed\r\ncontacts, directed the striking of signals by Mr. Little, and rendered\r\nother valuable services. Mr. Putnam was assisted in recording contacts\r\nby Mr. Hoxie. R. C. Child, observing with a 6-inch telescope of 7½\r\nfeet focus, made sketches with special reference to inner coronal\r\ndetail, and was in addition charged with all electrical circuits for\r\nchronograph and automatic photographic apparatus. Father Woodman, with\r\n3½-inch telescope, observed contacts and made sketches.\r\n\r\n    [C] 34°, 57′, 52″ N.\r\n\r\n    [D] 5h., 20m., 17.8s. W.\r\n\r\nThe first detachment, consisting of Messrs. Abbot, Fowle, Kramer\r\n(instrument maker) and Smith (carpenter), reached Wadesboro May 4th,\r\nand were soon joined by Messrs. Draper and Putnam. The latter returned\r\nto Washington after a short but satisfactory latitude and longitude\r\ncampaign, reaching Wadesboro again just before the eclipse. Other\r\nmembers of the party reached camp on and after the middle of the month.\r\nThe first comers found a very satisfactory shed already erected and\r\npiers begun. Not a day passed from the time of the arrival of the\r\napparatus, May 7th, to the day before the eclipse, that was not fully\r\noccupied in perfecting the arrangements.\r\n\r\nThe most striking portion of the installation was the line beginning at\r\nthe northwest pier, with its equatorial and cœlostat, continued from\r\nthence south of east by the two great diverging tubes of the 135-foot\r\ntelescope and spectroscope. These tubes were covered with white canvas,\r\npresenting the appearance of two immensely prolonged ‘A’ tents, ending\r\nbeyond the photographic house, where the 38-foot telescope tube\r\npointed east and upward at an angle of 42° with the horizon. When the\r\nequatorial, with its large special conical tube camera, with all this\r\nlong-branching extent of white canvas ending in the uplifted tube of\r\nthe 38-foot telescope, was seen in the light of the moon, the extensive\r\nfield with these preparations, exhibited a still more picturesque scene\r\nthan by day.\r\n\r\nLess imposing, and perhaps more ungainly was the combination of four\r\ngreat cameras under the main shed, designed to search for new planets\r\nand to depict the outer corona. These might well be described as like\r\na cabin and outbuilding, mounted on a polar axis, yet, despite their\r\nawkward proportions, they were made to follow very accurately.\r\n\r\nThe morning of the eclipse dawned cloudless and very fairly clear. Deep\r\nblue sky, such as the writer had seen on Pike’s Peak, of course, is not\r\namong the ordinary possibilities of an eclipse, but the milkiness of\r\nthe blue was less pronounced than is usual in the summer season, and\r\nall felt that the seeing promised well.\r\n\r\nAt fifteen minutes before totality a series of rapid strokes on the\r\nbell called every one to his post, and one minute before the expected\r\ncontact five strokes were given as a final warning. Coincidentally\r\nwith the actual observation of the second contact by Mr. Putnam, the\r\nfirst two strokes upon the bell sounded, and the work began. After\r\n82 seconds (the duration of totality from the Nautical Almanac was\r\n92 seconds), three strokes were given as a signal to stop the long\r\nphotographic exposures. Scarcely more than five seconds after this the\r\nsun’s crescent reappeared. The duration of totality, as observed by Mr.\r\nPutnam, was approximately 88 seconds.\r\n\r\nTo visual observers the sky was notably not a dark one. No second\r\nmagnitude stars were observed with the naked eye, and most of\r\nthe on-lookers saw only Mercury conspicuously, though Venus was\r\ndistinguished at a low altitude and Capella also was seen. So high a\r\ndegree of sky illumination can not but have operated unfavorably in the\r\nstudy of the outer corona or in the search for intra-mercurial planets,\r\nand this is to be remembered in connection with what follows.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEFORE TOTALITY.\r\n\r\nA deepened color in the sky, a fall of temperature and a rising breeze\r\nwere distinctly noticeable. No change in direction of the wind was\r\nnoted. Shadow bands were seen, but those who attempted to measure their\r\nvelocity found them too rapid and flickering for any great exactness\r\nin this determination. There was tolerable unanimity among independent\r\nobservers as to their size and distance apart (about five inches),\r\nthough some thought this less as totality approached.\r\n\r\nIt was noticed that the birds grew silent just before and during\r\ntotality, but true to their nature, the English sparrows were last to\r\nbe still and first to begin their discussion of the eclipse, after the\r\nreturn of light.\r\n\r\n\r\nDURING TOTALITY.\r\n\r\nThe attention of all visual observers was at once caught by the\r\nequatorial streamers. Father Woodman’s comparison of the appearance of\r\na structure of mother of pearl was generally recognized as good, but\r\ndifferent observers differed on the color estimate. A yellowish green\r\ntinge was noted by the artist of the party, Mr. Child, while to others\r\nthe light was straw colored or golden.\r\n\r\nThe general coronal form to the naked eye was nearly that of the\r\nsmall annexed photograph, which, though taken by one of the smaller\r\nobjectives, gives a good view of the relative intensities. The same\r\nextensions of the equatorial corona could be followed by the naked eye\r\nfrom 3 to 3½ solar diameters.\r\n\r\nThe visual telescopic observations of the writer gave little indication\r\nof the finely divided structure of the inner corona which he had\r\nnoticed at Pike’s Peak. Structure, to be sure, was evident, but not\r\nin such minute subdivision as had then been seen, and though one\r\nremarkable prominence as well as several smaller ones was visible, the\r\ncoronal streamers did not give to the writer the impression of being\r\nconnected with these prominences, though the relationship of some of\r\nthem to the solar poles was abundantly manifest.\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTER TOTALITY. _Results._\r\n\r\nComparing notes after totality, all observers reported a successful\r\ncarrying out of the programme. The greatest interest centers in the\r\ndirect coronal negatives taken with the 135-foot telescope. Mr. Smillie\r\nexposed six 30 × 30 plates during totality, with times ranging from one\r\nhalf a second to sixteen seconds, and three others were exposed by him\r\nimmediately after the third contact.\r\n\r\nAt this writing only a part of the negatives taken have been developed.\r\nTheir general quality may be inferred from the examples here given,\r\nafter due allowance for the great loss suffered by translation onto\r\npaper even with the best care.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1. GENERAL VIEW OF THE CORONA. TAKEN WITH 6 INCH\r\nLENS OF 7½ FEET FOCUS. 82 SECONDS EXPOSURE.]\r\n\r\nFig. 1 is a view taken with one of the smaller objectives (6 inches),\r\ngiven here to afford the reader an idea of the general disposition of\r\nthe coronal light. The upper part is the vertex in the inverted field.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2. PROMINENCES ON SOUTHWEST LIMB OF SUN.

It was obtained in the\r\ngreat disc in the last exposure during totality of 8 seconds, showing\r\none of the principal prominences then on the sun’s disc, with the\r\ndisposition of the lower filaments near it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3. NORTH POLAR CORONAL STREAMERS. TAKEN WITH 15\r\nINCH LENS OF 135 FEET FOCUS. EXPOSURE 16 SECONDS.]\r\n\r\nFig. 3 is a portion of one of the same set of plates, but taken with\r\na 16-second exposure. The part near the sun has, of course, been\r\nintentionally over-exposed, in order to better exhibit the remarkable\r\npolar streamers, extending here to a distance of about six minutes from\r\nthe sun, but seen still further in Mr. Child’s telescopic drawing (not\r\ngiven.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4. DARK ROOM AND TUBES OF 135 FOOT AND 38 FOOT\r\nTELESCOPES. 5 INCH EQUATORIAL IN FOREGROUND, PROF. LANGLEY OBSERVING.]\r\n\r\nFig. 4 is a view of a small part of the great apparatus on the field,\r\nincluding the terminus of the horizontal tube with its canvas covering,\r\nwhich has been described as like an extended ‘A’ tent. The photographic\r\nroom is seen at the end of the tube, and beyond that the tube\r\ncontaining the lens loaned by Professor Young pointing directly skyward.\r\n\r\nThat it will be impracticable to give here all of the disc of the moon\r\nin the large photographs, will be evident when it is considered that\r\nthe lunar circumference on each plate is about 4 feet; but it will be\r\ninferred from the examples that the prominences and polar streamers as\r\nwell as their features, appear in imposing magnitude and detail.\r\n\r\nMany of what it is hoped will be the most interesting photographs still\r\nawait development, but Mr. Smillie’s thorough preparation is promising\r\nadequate results.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEAT OF THE CORONA.\r\n\r\nMr. Abbot, with aid of Mr. Mendenhall, appears to have measured the\r\nheat of the corona, and in spite of previous efforts, this is probably\r\nthe first time that it has been really shown to exist. For five minutes\r\nbefore second contact, the bolometer was successfully exposed to the\r\nregion of the sky close to the narrowing crescent of the sun where the\r\ncorona was shortly to appear. A diaphragm was interposed in the beam\r\nhaving an aperture of only 0.4 sq. cm. Deflections, rapidly diminishing\r\nfrom 80 to 6 mm. were obtained, the last being about 40 seconds before\r\ntotality. Then the diaphragm was opened to 290 sq. cm. and a negative\r\ndeflection of 13 mm. was observed after totality, where these positive\r\ndeflections had just been found, showing that the corona was actually\r\ncooler than the background which had been used at the room temperature.\r\nNext the black surface of the moon was allowed to radiate upon the\r\nbolometer, and the still larger negative deflection of 18 mm. was\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\nThe important result was that the corona gave a positive indication of\r\nheat as compared with the moon.\r\n\r\nThis heat, though certain, was, however, too slight to be sub-divided\r\nby the dispersion of the prism with the means at hand.\r\n\r\nThe negatives taken to depict the outer corona show from three\r\nto four solar diameters extension for the longest streamers. The\r\nequatorial ‘wings,’ as they recede from the sun, are finally lost in an\r\nilluminated sky, without any indication of having actually come to an\r\nend.\r\n\r\nNo attempt to carefully examine the plates taken for intra-mercurial\r\nplanets has yet been possible. It is, however, as has been remarked,\r\ndoubtful if the very faintest objects will be found, in consideration\r\nof the considerable sky illumination during totality. However, Pleione\r\nin the Pleiades (a star of the 6.3 magnitude), is plainly seen on one\r\nof the plates, and some smaller ones are discernible.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, the expedition may be considered as promising to be very\r\nsatisfactory in its results, and that it was so is largely owing not\r\nonly to the efficient care of Mr. Abbot, but to the many gentlemen who\r\nhave assisted me with the loan of valuable apparatus, with counsel,\r\nwith voluntary service and with painstaking observation, to one and all\r\nof whom I desire to express my obligations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMALARIA AND THE MALARIAL PARASITE.[E]\r\n\r\nBY PATRICK MANSON, M. D., LL. D.,\r\n\r\nLECTURER ON TROPICAL DISEASES AT ST. GEORGE’S HOSPITAL AND\r\nCHARING-CROSS HOSPITAL MEDICAL SCHOOLS AND AT THE LONDON SCHOOL OF\r\nTROPICAL MEDICINE.\r\n\r\n    [E] Abstract of a lecture delivered at the Medical Graduates’\r\n        College and Polyclinic, and printed in the _Lancet_ of May 19.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis lecture is devoted to a description of the parasite and of its\r\nlife cycles. The existence of a parasite in malarial disease has been\r\nsuspected for a long time, but only very recently have we had absolute\r\nassurance that such a parasite exists. Some time in the thirties Meckel\r\ndescribed in the human blood certain black particles which he found\r\nin leucocytes and in certain pale, leucocyte-like bodies the nature\r\nof which he did not know. When he saw these bodies he certainly saw\r\nthe malarial parasite. His observations were repeated and extended in\r\nthe forties and the fifties by Frerichs and Virchow, and they, too,\r\nundoubtedly saw the malarial parasite. But it is one thing to see and\r\nquite another to recognize; discovery is recognition.\r\n\r\nThe discoveries of Laveran, Golgi, Marchiafava, Bignami and others\r\nresulted in considerable knowledge of the life history of the malarial\r\nparasite and of the correspondence between its life cycle and the\r\nclinical cycle of the disease. Laveran discovered the parasite; Golgi\r\ndescribed the cycle of the tertian and quartan forms; the others added\r\nnew data, especially concerning the more malignant parasites. The\r\nmalarial parasite in its mature form has the appearance--I shall take\r\nthe tertian parasite as a type--of a mass of pale protoplasm occupying\r\npractically the whole of the red blood corpuscles. Scattered through\r\nthis mass of protoplasm are a number of black specks or little rods of\r\nintensely black pigment. Later in the life of the parasite a peculiar\r\nthing happens: all these little specks of black pigment concentrate\r\nusually towards the center of the organism whilst the pale protoplasm\r\narranges itself into little spherules, the whole constituting what is\r\nknown as the ‘rosette body.’ Later in the life of the parasite the\r\nsurrounding blood corpuscle breaks away and this rosette body floats\r\nfree in the liquor sanguinis and then breaks up into its constituent\r\nspores, setting free at the same time the black pigment clump.\r\nPhagocytes attack many of these free spores and probably absorb most\r\nof them, as well as the little pieces of pigment. The result is the\r\npigmented leucocyte, so characteristic of malarial blood. A few of\r\nthe spores escape and in virtue of some peculiar faculty, which is\r\nnot at present understood, enter fresh blood corpuscles and appear\r\nthere as pale specks in the hæmoglobin. These pale specks, if watched\r\nin perfectly fresh blood, are seen to be possessed of very active\r\namœboid movement. They throw out pseudopodia in various directions and\r\nwander about through the hæmoglobin of the corpuscle. After a time\r\nthey increase in size by assimilating the hæmoglobin. By and by there\r\nappear somewhere in the parasite those specks of black pigment which\r\nwe saw in the mature animal. Later they increase still further in\r\nsize until they come to occupy half, and finally nearly the whole, of\r\nthe blood corpuscle. Again there is concentration of pigment and the\r\nformation of little sporules. This is the cycle, as described by Golgi,\r\nof the tertian and quartan parasite. The cycle of the tropical or\r\næstivo-autumnal parasite corresponds in plan almost exactly with that\r\nof the quartan and ordinary tertian parasite.\r\n\r\nIt was found that the life cycles of these parasites ran parallel\r\nwith the clinical cycle of malarial disease. It was found that when\r\nthe parasite had arrived at maturity the apyretic interval in an ague\r\nwas about to conclude, and that when the parasite had arrived at the\r\nsporulating stage the patient had entered on the shivering stage of\r\nhis fever. During that and the succeeding hot and sweating stage the\r\nspores had entered the red blood corpuscles, and when the parasite had\r\nensconced itself in the red blood corpuscle and begun to grow, the\r\nfever had come to an end. It was found in tertian fever that the cycle\r\nof the parasite took forty-eight hours to complete, exactly the length\r\nof the cycle of the clinical phenomena. In quartan fever the cycle took\r\nseventy-two hours, exactly the length of the clinical cycle of that\r\nform of malarial disease. In the malignant or tropical fevers there was\r\nfound to be a similar correspondence between the cycle of the parasite\r\nand the cycle of the disease. It was found that with each recurring\r\nparoxysm of fever there was a renewal of the life of the parasite, and\r\nthat in this way the life of the parasite was continued from period to\r\nperiod and from cycle to cycle for weeks or even, especially in the\r\ncase of quartan malaria, for months. Now this explains very well the\r\nway in which the malaria parasite contrives to maintain its existence\r\nin the human body, but it does not explain how it passes from host to\r\nhost, neither does it explain certain appearances that Laveran and\r\neverybody else who has studied the subject have witnessed. In malarial\r\nblood you sometimes see that peculiar body, the flagellated body, which\r\nI have already alluded to as consisting of a sphere surrounded by from\r\none to six or seven long tentacles or arms in a state of continual\r\nagitation. Neither does it explain the peculiar crescent-shaped body\r\nwhich also so pointedly arrested Laveran’s attention.... Golgi’s\r\nscheme leaves the passage of the parasite from host to host and also\r\nthe nature of these two bodies unexplained. What relation have these\r\ntwo bodies to the life of the parasite? Their nature and purpose do\r\nnot receive any illumination from Golgi’s theory. You will find in all\r\nforms of malarial infection, if you look enough, the flagellated body;\r\nbut, strange to say, you will not find it in malarial blood immediately\r\nafter it is withdrawn from the body. It is only after an interval of\r\nminutes, perhaps a quarter of an hour, after the blood is withdrawn\r\nthat these flagellated bodies appear. Whence do they come? If you make\r\na preparation of malarial blood from a patient by pricking the finger\r\nand spreading a little of the blood on a slide, fixing it immediately\r\nwith heat or alcohol and staining it, you will never see any of these\r\nflagellated organisms. But if the slip be kept moist and in a warm\r\ntemperature for half an hour and then stained, the flagellated bodies\r\nwill be seen, proving that they develop only after the escape of the\r\nparasite from the human body. Such a fact is very interesting and\r\nobviously has some significance in connection with the life of the\r\nparasite. Whence, I ask, come these flagellated bodies? If one of the\r\ncrescent-shaped bodies is observed continuously, the following changes\r\nof shape may often be observed: It becomes shorter, loses its crescent\r\nshape and gives off flagella, which may break off and swim about by\r\nthemselves. When they come in contact with a blood corpuscle they\r\nstraighten themselves out and indulge in a peculiar vibratory movement,\r\nas if endeavoring to penetrate the corpuscle.\r\n\r\nMany years ago King, in America, and others too numerous to mention\r\nsuspected that the mosquito had something to do with malaria, but in\r\nwhat way they could not say. Not only civilized observers had this\r\nsuspicion, but the savage natives of certain tropical countries had the\r\nsame idea. Koch tells us that certain natives of German East Africa\r\nwho lived in a mountainous, and therefore non-malarial, part noticed\r\nthat when they descended to the malarial regions on the coast they\r\nacquired a fever which they called ‘mbu.’ They said that they were\r\nbitten there by certain insects which they also called ‘mbu’--mosquito\r\nor gnat. They give the same name to the mosquito and to the fever,\r\ntherefore obviously these savages associate the insect and the fever\r\nas cause and effect. Peasants in certain parts of Italy have the same\r\nidea, believing that the bite of the mosquito may be followed by the\r\ndevelopment of malarial fever.\r\n\r\nLaveran, some years ago, in one of his numerous works on malarial\r\nfever, said that possibly the malarial parasite was cared for by the\r\nmosquito in the same way that the latter cares for the filaria of the\r\nblood. He did not, however, formulate a definite theory on the subject.\r\n\r\nIn 1894 I was engaged in working at malaria, following out Golgi’s work\r\nand that of other Italians. I was particularly struck by the phenomena\r\nof exflagellation and more particularly by the fact that it occurred\r\nonly when the blood had been removed from and was outside the human\r\nbody. I reasoned that if this exflagellation occurs only outside the\r\nbody, the purpose of the flagellated body must lie outside the human\r\nbody, and that therefore the flagellated body must be the first phase\r\nof the malarial parasite outside the body, must be the first step that\r\nthe malarial parasite takes in passing from one human host to another.\r\nThere seemed to me to be a sort of logic in this. But how was the\r\nmalarial parasite to pass from one human being to another? It was not\r\nprovided while inside the human body with any organs of locomotion or\r\npenetration; as far as we know the parasite is never extruded in the\r\nexcreta, neither does it habitually escape in hæmorrhages. Therefore,\r\nthe idea of a spontaneous escape of the parasite from the human body\r\nhad to be dismissed. I therefore concluded that some extraneous agency\r\nmust remove the parasite from the human body, so as to afford the\r\nopportunity for this flagellation which I had concluded must constitute\r\nthe first step in its extra-corporeal life. In casting about for an\r\norganism which could effect this removal I, for many reasons similar\r\nin some respects to those that influenced the savage African, the\r\nItalian peasant, King, Laveran and others, came to the conclusion\r\nthat the medium of removal and transit must be the mosquito. I was so\r\nimpressed with the probabilities of this double hypothesis and with\r\nits extreme practical value, should it prove to be correct, that I\r\nendeavored to leave England for a time and to visit British Guiana\r\nor some such suitable malarial country where I might work out the\r\nidea. Unfortunately, that could not be accomplished, so I published\r\nmy theory in the hope that it would appeal to someone who might enjoy\r\nthe opportunities denied to me. At that time Surgeon-Major Ross was\r\nat home from India and we had many conversations on the subject. I\r\ndescribed to him my hypothesis, the probabilities of which and the\r\npossibilities of which powerfully appealed to his highly logical and\r\npractical mind. He undertook, when he returned to India, to do his best\r\neither to establish or confute it. Accordingly he set to work in India\r\nexperimenting with mosquitoes and malaria.\r\n\r\nRoss was stationed in Secunderabad, in the south of India, where there\r\nwas abundant opportunity for experimental work--plenty of patients and\r\nplenty of mosquitoes. He got patients with crescent parasites in their\r\nblood and he got mosquitoes to bite them. He found that in the course\r\nof a few minutes after the blood had entered the insects’ stomachs the\r\ncrescent parasites proceeded to the formation of sphere and flagellated\r\nbody. But he got no further. This experiment was repeated hundreds of\r\ntimes. Many of his preparations were sent to me, and I could confirm\r\nfrom them the accuracy of his statements on the subject. Ross was\r\nencouraged, for obviously we were on the right track. One day Ross,\r\nwhose station had in the meantime been changed, caught some mosquitoes\r\nwhich had been feeding on a patient the subject of tertian malaria.\r\nHe kept the mosquitoes and after a few days dissected them. He took\r\nthe stomach out and placed it on a slip with a little salt solution,\r\ncovered it with a cover-glass and examined it with a microscope. He\r\nwas gratified to find lying amongst the transverse and longitudinal\r\nmuscular fibres a number of spherical bodies, very sharply defined,\r\nand including a great many grains of intensely black pigment exactly\r\nlike those of the malaria parasite. Ross was at once struck with the\r\nsimilarity. After years of labor he believed he had at last seen the\r\nmalaria parasite in the tissues of the mosquito, where we reasoned\r\nit ought to be; and he was right. At a subsequent experiment on the\r\nmalarial patient he found exactly the same bodies, and on dissecting\r\nseveral mosquitoes at different intervals of time he found that the\r\nparasite, which originally was six micro-millimetres in diameter\r\nonly, grew to sixty or eighty micro-millimetres, each parasite,\r\nnotwithstanding its growth and the lapse of time, still containing the\r\npeculiar and most characteristic black pigment. Ross was now quite sure\r\nthat he had found the extra-corporeal phase of the malarial parasite.\r\nSome of these preparations he sent home. I examined them and showed\r\nthem to a number of friends in London familiar with the malarial\r\nparasite; they agreed with me, as Laveran also did, in believing that\r\nprobably this indeed was the long-sought-for extra-corporeal phase\r\nof the malarial parasite. Ross at that time had great difficulty in\r\ngetting opportunities for experiment on the human subject and in\r\nprocuring proper mosquitoes. He found that the mosquitoes in which\r\nhe had discovered these pigmented bodies were of a different species\r\nto those on which he had formerly experimented, and that in this\r\ncircumstance lay the explanation of his lack of success earlier as\r\nwell as the secret of his ultimate success. Failing to get sufficient\r\nopportunity for experimenting on human malaria he turned to bird\r\nmalaria. He found that the sparrow of Calcutta, in a large proportion\r\nof instances, contained in its blood a malaria-like parasite. Ross\r\nprocured a number of infected sparrows and let loose upon them a number\r\nof mosquitoes of a species belonging to the genus _culex_. These\r\nmosquitoes, after from one to ten days, he dissected and examined their\r\nstomachs. He found in the stomach-wall pigmented bodies exactly similar\r\nto those which he found in the stomach-walls of mosquitoes fed on human\r\nmalarial blood. He found that they increased in size and in a week or\r\nten days grew from six to eighty micro-millimetres in diameter. When\r\nthey became of considerable size they protruded like warts from the\r\nsurface of the insect’s stomach and were included in a very definite\r\ncapsule. At this stage the capsule was filled with a vast number of\r\nvery minute rod-like bodies. These capsules, which now projected into\r\nthe body cavity of the insect, being over-distended, ruptured and\r\ndischarged the rod-like bodies into the body cavity of the mosquito.\r\nFor a time Ross could get no further than this. He could not find what\r\nbecame of the rod-like bodies. One day, in dissecting the head of a\r\nmosquito, he encountered two small trilobed glands the ducts from\r\nwhich united to form a main duct. The glands lay on either side of the\r\nhead and the common duct he traced to the base of the proboscis of the\r\nmosquito. This was the salivary gland of the mosquito. He found that\r\nthe cells of the gland contained rod-like bodies exactly like those\r\nwhich he had found inside the parasitic capsules in the stomach-wall.\r\nHe concluded that somehow these ‘germinal rods’ (for so he called\r\nthem) had managed to find their way into the salivary gland of the\r\nmosquito. It immediately occurred to him that this might be the route\r\nby which the parasite escaped from the mosquito into its vertebrate\r\nhost. No sooner had the idea occurred to Ross than he put it to the\r\ntest of experiment. He selected a number of sparrows in whose blood\r\nhe satisfied himself that there were no parasites and let loose upon\r\nthem a number of mosquitoes which he had already infected with malarial\r\nparasites. He found after a week or ten days that the sparrows which\r\nwere experimented upon sickened and many of them died; and in their\r\nblood he found the malarial parasite.\r\n\r\nWe now understand why the flagellated body is developed outside the\r\nhuman host: because its function lies outside the human host. We now\r\nunderstand why the flagella break away and enter the granular sphere:\r\nthey impregnate it and start it on the road of development. We now\r\nunderstand why MacCallum’s vermicule is beaked and endowed with powers\r\nof locomotion and penetration: that it may approach and penetrate the\r\nstomach of the mosquito. And we now know why the sporozooites, the\r\n‘germinal rods,’ enter the mosquito’s salivary gland: that they may be\r\ninjected into vertebrate issue and so pass the parasite from vertebrate\r\nto vertebrate.\r\n\r\nThis is one of those fairy tales of science which people are inclined\r\nto doubt, but any one who has worked at the subject and taken the\r\ntrouble to go through the long series of preparations which have been\r\nsent home from India can not for a moment have the slightest doubt\r\nthat what Ross stated was absolutely true, and that not only for bird\r\nbut for human malaria. So soon as the idea got abroad that the key to\r\nthe way in which the malarial parasite is propagated had been found\r\nthe Italians immediately set to work with renewed vigor and with the\r\nutmost skill. Almost at once they demonstrated that what happened in\r\nthe case of Ross’s sparrows happened also with the human subject: that\r\nthe appropriate species of mosquito fed upon the human malarial subject\r\nand subsequently allowed to feed upon a non-malarial subject conveyed\r\nthe malarial parasite and malarial disease, and that the appropriate\r\nspecies of mosquito belonged to the genus anopheles. There can not be\r\nthe slightest doubt that the mosquito acts the part of transmitting\r\nagent as well as definitive host of the malarial parasite.\r\n\r\nThis is a piece of knowledge of the utmost importance to mankind, for\r\nwe know that malarial disease in tropical countries--which, after\r\nall, in the future will be the most important parts of the world,\r\nseeing that they can produce more food than temperate countries and\r\ncan therefore support a larger population--causes more deaths and more\r\ndisposition to death by inducing cachectic states predisposing to other\r\naffections than all the other parasites affecting mankind put together.\r\nWe know now in what way this parasite is acquired. Depend upon it,\r\nin time, in virtue of this knowledge, we will get enormous power\r\nover the disease and sooner or later we will be able to prevent the\r\ninfection of man by the parasite. It is only a question of study and\r\nthe application of the knowledge already acquired, only a question of\r\nmoney and perseverance and a little ingenuity, and these results will\r\ncome. It may not be in ten years or twenty years, but sooner or later\r\nthe energies of a considerable portion of scientific mankind now being\r\nexpended in endeavoring to devise means for preventing the infection of\r\nmen with the malarial germ by the mosquito will bear valuable fruit.\r\n\r\nYou can readily understand that it is of great importance to be able\r\nto recognize the special species of mosquito which convey malaria.\r\nThe effective species as regards human malaria belong to the genus\r\nanopheles; species of the genus culex are effective in the case of\r\nsparrow malaria. Fortunately, these two genera are easily recognized\r\neven by the amateur zoölogist. If you find a mosquito clinging to\r\nthe wall or other surface you can tell which genus it belongs to by\r\nits posture. If the body is stuck out nearly at right angles to the\r\nsurface on which the insect is resting, it is an anopheles. If the body\r\nis almost parallel to the surface, it is a culex. There is another\r\ntest which is easily applied if you have a pocket lens; in culex the\r\ntwo organs known as palpi are rudimentary and very short; whereas\r\nin anopheles those organs are almost as long as the proboscis. It\r\nshould be remembered that the male mosquito is not a blood-sucker and\r\ntherefore is not dangerous. It is the female anopheles which transmits\r\nthe disease. The mosquito larvæ inhabit stagnant or slow-running water.\r\nIf a mosquito larva be found with its head downwards, the body hanging\r\nat right angles to the surface of the water, it is a culex; if the body\r\nlies parallel to the surface of the water, it is an anopheles. There\r\nare other points of difference with which I need not now trouble you;\r\nthose referred to suffice for diagnosis between the innocuous and the\r\ndangerous mosquitoes.\r\n\r\nThe facts regarding the malaria parasite which I have described are\r\nof great importance for many reasons. First, because they help us to\r\nunderstand the pathology and etiology of malaria. Secondly, they help\r\nus in diagnosis. Thirdly, our knowledge of the parasite is invaluable\r\nin directing treatment. Lastly, a knowledge of the life-history of the\r\nmalarial parasite is of extreme value for the prevention of malarial\r\ndisease, for could we by mechanical or other arrangements prevent\r\nthe mosquito attacking the human body, we could prevent the malarial\r\nparasites from entering the human body; or if we could abolish the\r\nmosquito by drainage or other means from a country, then we might be\r\nsure that we would abolish the malaria of that country also.\r\n\r\nAttempts are being made to solve these practical problems. At the\r\npresent moment such attempts are being actively made in Rome by\r\nProfessor Celli and elsewhere by others. I have no doubt that in the\r\ncourse of a few years we shall get some very valuable results in\r\nthis direction and that, thanks to this new-born knowledge about the\r\nmalarial parasites, better times are rapidly approaching for malarial\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW SOURCES OF LIGHT AND OF RÖNTGEN RAYS.\r\n\r\nBY HENRY CARRINGTON BOLTON, PH. D.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the general laws of physical science, none seems more firmly\r\nestablished than that of the conservation and correlation of energy;\r\naccording to this the various forms of energy that constitute the\r\ndomain of experimental physics, heat, light, electricity, magnetism\r\nand chemical action, have reciprocal dependence and “can not originate\r\notherwise than by devolution from some preëxisting force,” or rather\r\nenergy. That motion is convertible into heat, heat into light and both\r\nthe former into electricity are phenomena familiar to every one who\r\nuses incandescent bulbs or rides in a trolley, and we do not usually\r\nrecognize any production of light unaccompanied by heat. True, the\r\nlittle fire-fly is possessed of a mysterious power that enables it\r\nto emit light without enough heat to affect Langley’s most sensitive\r\nbolometer, but the eminent Secretary of the Smithsonian has to admit\r\nthat the “cheapest form of light” is produced by “processes of nature\r\nof which we know nothing.” This little understood property called\r\nphosphorescence is shared by many living organisms, both animal and\r\nvegetable, as well as by substances of the mineral kingdom; to the\r\nformer belong coelenterates, mollusks, crustacea, fishes and insects,\r\nand decaying wood, certain mushrooms, etc.; to the latter the Bologna\r\nstone, so-called, and the commercial article called ‘Balmain’s paint.’\r\n\r\nIn the case of the mineral substances, barium or calcium sulfids and\r\nthe like, the light-giving power is not an innate property, but is\r\nset in operation by exposure to the energy of sunlight, the light of\r\nburning magnesium or to some other source of actinism; moreover, the\r\npower thus acquired by insolation is a fugitive one, the substances\r\nexercising it after three or four hours become ‘dead’ and lose their\r\nactivity. Excepting then these living beings and these phosphorescent\r\nbodies, light as commonly known to us is always correlated with heat;\r\nwithin the last four years, however, discoveries have been made in\r\nFrance that seem to modify the position taken by philosophers and to\r\nnecessitate new views concerning the manifestations of that energy with\r\nwhich the universe is endowed. A group of French savants have found\r\nmineral substances that apparently give out light perpetually without\r\nany exciting cause, realizing the dream of the alchemists--a perpetual\r\nlamp consuming no oil. These substances also emit rays having the\r\npenetrating properties of X-rays, other rays affecting a photographic\r\nplate, and fourthly, rays causing air to become a conductor of\r\nelectricity. The history of these discoveries can be briefly given.\r\n\r\nRöntgen’s discovery of the rays that pass through metals and solids\r\nopaque to light was made in 1895, and in the following year, Becquerel,\r\na distinguished French academician, discovered that salts of the metal\r\nuranium (substances that had long been used in coloring china and\r\nglass) emit invisible radiations capable of discharging electrified\r\nbodies and of producing skiagraphic images on sensitive plates; he\r\nfound that potassio-uranic sulfate emits rays that pass through black\r\npaper and give photographic impressions in the same way as Röntgen\r\nrays. This property is not limited to the brilliantly fluorescent\r\nuranic salts, but is shared by the non-fluorescent uranous salts,\r\nand is exhibited by compounds whether phosphorescent or not, whether\r\ncrystalline, melted or in solution, as well as by the metal itself. The\r\npermanence of this activity is amazing, substances kept in a double\r\nleaden box more than three years continuing to exert the power.\r\n\r\nShortly after the announcement by Becquerel, experimenters found that\r\nother substances have the power of emitting ‘Becquerel Rays,’ such\r\nas calcium and zinc sulfids and compounds of thorium. In 1898 Mme.\r\nSklodowska Curie, working in the laboratory of the Municipal School of\r\nIndustrial Physics and Chemistry in Paris, devised a special apparatus\r\nfor measuring the electrical conductivity of the air when under the\r\ninfluence of ‘radio-active bodies,’ and by its means studied the\r\nbehavior of pitchblende (uraninite), and of other uranium minerals;\r\nfinding that some specimens of pitchblende had three times as much\r\nenergy as uranium itself, she came to the conclusion that the peculiar\r\nproperty is due to some unknown body contained in the minerals and not\r\nto uranium. Examining the mineral with the aid of her husband, the two\r\nfound a substance analogous to bismuth, four thousand times stronger\r\nthan uranium, which was named ‘Polonium,’ in honor of the native land\r\nof Mme. Curie. In December of the same year, the lady received the\r\nGegner prize of 4,000 francs awarded by the Academy of Sciences, as\r\na substantial appreciation of her discovery, and later in the same\r\nmonth Mme. and M. Curie announced that they had found a second body in\r\npitchblende, which they named ‘Radium.’ More recently, M. Debierne,\r\nworking under the auspices of Mme. Curie, has discovered a third\r\nbody, which he calls ‘Actinium,’ an unfortunate appellation because\r\n‘actinium’ has already been used for an element announced by Dr.\r\nPhipson and since discarded.\r\n\r\nThese three ‘radio-active’ substances do not possess identical\r\nproperties; their rays are unequally absorbed and are differently\r\naffected in a magnetic field; moreover radium emits visible rays, while\r\npolonium does not. Nor have they the same chemical affinities; polonium\r\nbelongs to the bismuth group, radium to the barium and actinium to the\r\ntitanium series. They have not been separated perfectly from their\r\nanalogues, and consequently their chemical properties and the actual\r\nintensity of their physical activities is very imperfectly known. The\r\ndifficulties of securing even small quantities of crude materials\r\nare enormous; Fritz Giesel obtained from one thousand kilograms of\r\nraw material only fifteen grams of active compounds, and Mme. Curie,\r\noperating on half a ton of the residues of uranium from a chemical\r\nmanufactory, got about two kilograms of barium chloride rich in radium,\r\nbut the percentage of active substances in these mixtures is unknown.\r\n\r\nRadium is spontaneously luminous, and all the bodies emit rays that\r\nexcite phosphorescence in gems, fluorite and other minerals; they\r\ncommunicate radiant energy to inactive substances, and they exert\r\nchemical action, transforming oxygen into ozone and producing changes\r\nin the color of glass and of barium platino-cyanid.\r\n\r\nThrough the enterprise and liberality of the Smithsonian Institution,\r\nand by the courtesy of Professor Langley, I have enjoyed the\r\nopportunity of studying small specimens of these rare and costly\r\nsubstances; they comprised ten grams of ‘radio-active substance’\r\nprepared by a manufacturing chemist of Germany and smaller quantities\r\nof ‘radium’ and of ‘polonium’ from Paris. On removing the wrappings\r\nof the German specimens in a dark room, they were seen to emit\r\ngreenish-white light that gave to the enveloping papers a peculiar\r\nglow, similar to the fluorescence produced by Röntgen rays. Simple\r\ntests of the radium showed that it gave the usual reactions of barium;\r\non boiling it with water it lost its luminosity, but on heating to dull\r\nredness this property returned in the dark. It also caused a barium\r\nplatino-cyanid screen to fluoresce.\r\n\r\nExperiments to test the actinic power of these bodies gave interesting\r\nresults; on exposing sections of photographic plates, at distances of\r\nfive inches, from two to twelve minutes, bands were obtained varying\r\nin intensity with the duration of action. By exposing sensitive plates\r\nbehind negatives to the radiant materials from two to three hours,\r\nexcellent transparencies were secured; on substituting Eastman’s\r\nbromide paper good prints were obtained.\r\n\r\nThe penetrating power of the rays emitted permits the production\r\nof skiagraphs; the plates were enveloped in Carbutt’s black paper\r\n(impermeable to light), and on them were laid pieces of tinfoil cut\r\nin openwork pattern; after one hour’s exposure negatives were secured\r\nplainly showing the pattern. Analogous experiments were carried on with\r\nthe specimens from Paris, but they were only one fifth as strong in\r\neffects; that labelled ‘polonium sub-nitrate’ had positively no action\r\non the plates used.\r\n\r\nThe primary source of the energy manifested by these extraordinary\r\nsubstances has greatly puzzled physicists, and as yet remains a\r\nmystery. Mme. Curie, speculating on the matter, conjectured that all\r\nspace is continually traversed by rays analogous to Röntgen rays, but\r\nfar more penetrating, and not capable of being absorbed by certain\r\nelements of high atomic weight, such as uranium and thorium. Becquerel,\r\nreflecting on the marvellous spontaneous emission of light, said: “If\r\nit can be proved that the luminosity causes no loss of energy, the\r\nstate of the uranium is like that of a magnet which has been produced\r\nby an expenditure of energy and retains it indefinitely, maintaining\r\naround it a field in which transformation of energy can be effected;\r\nbut the photographic reductions and the excitation of phosphorescence\r\nrequire an expenditure of energy, of which the source can only be in\r\nthe radio-active substances.” Somewhat later, Becquerel hazarded the\r\nopinion that the radiation is composed at least in part of cathodic\r\nrays; but these have been proved to be material, hence the induced\r\nactivity must be caused by material particles impinging upon the\r\nsubstances excited. This materialistic theory seems to be confirmed by\r\nthe results of ingenious experiments made by Mme. and M. Curie; they\r\nplaced a sensitive plate beneath a salt of radium supported on a slab\r\nof lead, in the vicinity of an electro-magnet. Under these conditions,\r\nwhen the current was passing, the rays emitted were bent in curved\r\nlines upon the sensitive plate, making impressions.\r\n\r\nIt may be objected, says a French writer, that the materialistic theory\r\nrequires us to admit actual loss of particles of matter, nevertheless\r\nthe charges are so feeble that the most intense radiation yet observed\r\nwould require millions of years for the removal of one milligram of\r\nsubstance.\r\n\r\nWhile writing these lines, we have news of experiments that seem to\r\nthrow doubt on the elementary character of these radio-active bodies;\r\nBela von Lengyel, of Budapest, claims to have prepared the so-called\r\n‘radium’ synthetically. By fusing with the heat of electricity uranium\r\nnitrate mixed with a small percentage of barium nitrate, and treating\r\nthe mass with acids, he obtained a substance that gives out actinic\r\nrays, Röntgen rays, excites platino-cyanid screens and causes air to\r\nconduct electricity; in short, the Hungarian chemist gets material\r\npossessing all the properties characteristic of the ‘element’ announced\r\nby Mme. Curie.\r\n\r\nAdmitting that radio-active bodies can be manufactured to order, are we\r\nany nearer explaining their mysterious powers?\r\n\r\nSpeculations as to the future history and applications of these\r\nwonder-working bodies press upon even the dullest imagination; if a\r\nfew grams of earth-born material, containing only a small percentage\r\nof the active body, emit light enough to affect the human eye and a\r\nphotographic plate, as well as rays that penetrate with X-ray power,\r\nwhat degree of luminosity, of actinism and of Röntgenism (if the\r\nterm may be allowed), is to be expected from an hundred weight of\r\nthe quintessence of energy purified from interfering matter? And to\r\nwhat uses is this light-generating material to be applied? Are our\r\nbicycles to be lighted with discs of radium in tiny lanterns? Are these\r\nsubstances to give us the ‘cheapest form of light?’ Are we about to\r\nrealize the chimerical dream of the alchemists?\r\n\r\nSeriously, in what direction is profound study of these substances\r\ngoing to lead us? Will it not greatly extend our knowledge of physical\r\nmanifestations of energy and their correlation? In what corner of\r\nthe globe will be found the cheap and convenient supply of the raw\r\nmaterial yielding the radio-active bodies? Will not chemists be obliged\r\nto re-examine much known material by laboratory methods conducted in\r\nthe dark? Many of us have worked up pounds of pitchblende to extract\r\nthe uranium oxids, and in so doing have poured down the waste-pipe or\r\nthrown into the dust-bin the more interesting and precious bodies.\r\n\r\nWhatever the future may bring, scientists are deeply indebted to\r\nBecquerel and to Mme. and M. Curie for placing in their hands new\r\nmethods of research and for furnishing a novel basis for speculation\r\ndestined to yield abundant fruits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION AND CORRESPONDENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n_WASHINGTON AS AN EXPLORER AND SURVEYOR._\r\n\r\nWashington was a surveyor and explorer before he entered upon the\r\nfields of war and statecraft, and his honesty of purpose, sincerity of\r\naction and accuracy of statement and method, so manifest throughout\r\nhis career as a soldier and statesman, are found also in the earlier\r\nrecord. At the age of sixteen he crossed the Blue Ridge on horseback\r\nand made a series of successful surveys in the Shenandoah valley,\r\novercoming physical obstacles with the method and system of a modern\r\nscientist. At twenty-two he led a party into the wilderness of the\r\nvalley of the Ohio to treat with the French and Indians. He then became\r\nacquainted with the great resources of the interior, and saw that\r\nthe valleys of the James and Potomac afforded unusual facilities for\r\nlines of transportation for the trade ‘of a rising empire.’ In 1754 he\r\nreported in favor of a scheme of communication between the Atlantic\r\nstates and the great west. Sixteen years later he suggested that the\r\nproject of opening up the Potomac be ‘recommended to public notice.’\r\nThe idea contained in the Potomac scheme was of far-reaching import,\r\nand only the present generation can fully realize its significance.\r\n\r\nWashington was not only the first to map and recommend the general\r\nroute of the great highways called the National Pike and the Chesapeake\r\nand Ohio Canal, which are now in truth ‘becoming the channels of\r\nconveyance of the extensive and valuable trade of a rising empire,’ but\r\nhe was also the first to predict the commercial success of that route\r\nthrough the Mohawk valley which was afterwards taken by the Erie Canal\r\nand the New York Central Railroad.\r\n\r\nOne hundred and fifteen years ago he asked: “Would it not be worthy\r\nof the wisdom and attention of Congress to have the western waters\r\nwell explored, the navigation of them fully ascertained and accurately\r\nlaid down, and a complete and perfect map made of the country.... The\r\nadvantages would be unbounded, for sure I am that nature has made such\r\na display of her bounties in those regions that the more the country\r\nis explored the more it will rise in estimation, consequently greater\r\nwill the revenue be to the Union.” Again he declared, “I shall not rest\r\ncontented until I have explored the western country and have traversed\r\nthose lines which have given bounds to a new empire.”\r\n\r\nWashington did not do this as fully as he wished, but his ambition\r\nhas been and is being realized through the medium of hundreds of\r\nenterprises under both national and private encouragement. The result\r\nof a trip made in the fall of 1784 was the real historic beginning of\r\nthe Potomac enterprise. On his return he wrote to Benjamin Harrison,\r\nGovernor of Virginia, “I shall take the liberty now, my dear sir, to\r\nsuggest a matter which would mark your administration as an important\r\nera in the annals of this country if it should be recommended by you\r\nand adopted by the Assembly.” He reached far out for those days,\r\nassuming Detroit as a point of departure for the trade of the northwest\r\nterritory. His confidence in the practical abilities of the American\r\npeople is shown by the remark, “A people who are possessed with the\r\nspirit of commerce, who see and will pursue their destinies, may\r\nachieve almost anything. No person who knows the temper, genius and\r\npolicy of this people as well as I do can harbor the smallest doubt.”\r\n\r\nIn urging the Potomac scheme, he later asked that commissioners be\r\nappointed to make a careful survey of the Potomac and James rivers\r\nto their respective sources, and that a complete map of the country\r\nintervening between the seaboard, the Ohio waters and the Great Lakes\r\nbe presented to the people. “These things being done,” he says, “I\r\nshall be mistaken if prejudice does not yield to facts, jealousy to\r\ncandor and finally, if reason and nature, thus aided, do not dictate\r\nwhat is right and proper to be done.”\r\n\r\nHe introduced his plan to the notice of Congress, thus making the\r\nfirst suggestion to that body of the policy of national improvements\r\nwhich the present generation is carrying on, as well as of the policy\r\nof exploration and national surveys to which our Government so firmly\r\nadheres. To-day the Government is carrying forward surveying work by\r\nmeans of the largest and most thoroughly equipped organizations in\r\nexistence, and thus is Washington honored.\r\n\r\nThe scientific men of to-day owe to Washington profound respect and\r\ngratitude for the scientific spirit he cultivated in his work. The\r\nGovernment once established on so high a plane, it necessarily followed\r\nthat all true science should be encouraged and be enlisted in the\r\ndevelopment of the citizen and of the material resources of the nation.\r\n\r\n    CHARLES D. WALCOTT,\r\n      _U. S. Geological Survey_,\r\n        _Washington, D. C._\r\n\r\n\r\n_SCIENCE AND FICTION._\r\n\r\nThe leading article of the June number of the _Century Magazine_ is\r\nentitled “The Problem of increasing Human Energy,” and is written by\r\nNikola Tesla. Mr. Tesla offers the reader some naive verbal analogies\r\nbetween the causes of human progress and the ‘energy’ of theoretical\r\nphysics, and a eulogy of a number of inventions which he expects to\r\nmake. He intersperses these with sundry remarkable statements such\r\nas, “our own earth will be a lump of ice;” “Though this movement is\r\nnot of a translatory character, yet the general laws of mechanical\r\nmovement are applicable to it;” “That we can send a message to a planet\r\nis certain, that we can get an answer is probable;” “It is highly\r\nprobable that if there are intelligent beings on Mars they have long\r\nago realized this very idea [the transmission of electrical energy for\r\nindustrial purposes without wires], _which would explain the changes on\r\nits surface noted by astronomers_.” (The italics are our own.)\r\n\r\nMr. Tesla’s doctrine of human energy is in some ways as original as\r\nthe inventions and discoveries which he expects to make. Each of us\r\nis, he says, a part of a unitary whole, ‘man.’ “This one human being\r\nlives on and on.... Therein ... is to be found the partial explanation\r\nof many of those marvelous phenomena of heredity which are the result\r\nof countless centuries of feeble but persistent influence.” Now we may\r\n“assume that human energy is measured by half the product of man’s\r\nmass with the square of a certain hypothetical velocity ... the great\r\nproblem of science is, and always will be, to increase the energy thus\r\ndefined.... This mass is impelled in one direction by a force F, which\r\nis resisted by another partly frictional and partly negative force R,\r\nacting in a direction exactly opposite, and retarding the movement of\r\nthe mass.”\r\n\r\nUnhappily Mr. Tesla in his enthusiasm to progress to recommendations of\r\nreligion, vegetarianism, the old régime for women and the artificial\r\npreparation of nitrogen compounds, neglects to state which direction\r\nis the proper one for the human mass to follow, north, south, east,\r\nwest, toward the moon or Sirius or to Dante’s Satan in the centre of\r\nthe earth. Nor does he explain how ‘enlightenment’ makes the mass of\r\nhuman bodies go in an exactly opposite direction to that toward which\r\n‘visionariness’ impels them, nor reveal why, if his account be true, he\r\nand a ‘visionary’ can walk in the same direction. Of course the whole\r\nnotion that the ‘velocity’ of the human ‘mass,’ _i.e._ the space it\r\ntraverses in a given time, has any connection with human progress or is\r\nof any value to anybody or anything, is absurd.\r\n\r\nMr. Tesla has enjoyed considerable, excellent repute as a gifted\r\nstudent of certain electrical phenomena and one expects a good deal\r\nfrom his “electrical experiments, now first published.” Mr. Tesla,\r\ntoo, expects a good deal from them. It would take too long to even\r\nnote here all the important scientific discoveries which Mr. Tesla\r\nexpects to make or all the benefits which he expects to thereby confer\r\nupon mankind in general and in particular upon those who exploit his\r\ninventions. Some samples may be given. War will be rendered harmless by\r\nbeing reduced to a sort of game between ‘telautaumata,’ machines which\r\nbehave “just like a blind-folded person obeying instructions received\r\nthrough the ear,” any one of which is “enabled to move and to perform\r\nall its operations with reason and intelligence.”\r\n\r\nSays Mr. Tesla: “I purpose to show that, however impossible it may now\r\nseem, an automaton may be contrived which will have its ‘own mind,’\r\nand by this I mean that it will be able, independent of any operator,\r\nleft entirely to itself, to perform, in response to external influences\r\naffecting its sensitive organs, a great variety of acts and operations\r\nas if it had intelligence. It will be able to follow a course laid\r\nout or to obey orders given far in advance; it will be capable of\r\ndistinguishing between what it ought and what it ought not to do, and\r\nof making experiences or, otherwise stated, of recording impressions\r\nwhich will definitely affect its subsequent actions. In fact, I have\r\nalready conceived such a plan.”\r\n\r\nInasmuch as the interest in this telautomatic warfare is to be purely\r\næsthetic, it would seem as if international bull-fights or kite-flying\r\nor spelling matches or potato-races might do as well, and have the\r\nadded advantage of leaving Mr. Tesla’s expectations free to wander\r\namong the following prospective discoveries.\r\n\r\nNew sources of energy, Mr. Tesla thinks, may be opened up, such as a\r\nwheel which shall perform work without any further effort on our part\r\nthan that of constructing it. “Imagine a disc of some homogeneous\r\nmaterial turned perfectly true and arranged to turn in frictionless\r\nbearings on a horizontal shaft above the ground. This disk, being under\r\nthe above conditions perfectly balanced, would rest in any position.\r\nNow, it is possible that we may learn how to make such a disk rotate\r\ncontinuously and perform work by the force of gravity without any\r\nfurther effort on our part.... To make the disk rotate by the force of\r\ngravity we have only to invent a screen against this force. By such a\r\nscreen we could prevent this force from acting on one half of the disk,\r\nand the rotation of the latter would follow.”\r\n\r\nInto further particulars concerning the nature of such a screen Mr.\r\nTesla does not enter, though it would seem a matter well fitted to\r\nengage his peculiar gifts. The ‘screen against gravity’ idea has\r\nalready entered into a popular story, but scientific men have probably\r\nnot given it much consideration.\r\n\r\nBy producing a ‘sink’ or reservoir of a low temperature, thereby\r\ninducing the heat of the ambient medium to transform itself in part\r\ninto other forms of energy (_e.g._ electrical), Mr. Tesla hopes to “get\r\nany amount of energy without further effort” beyond the amount needed\r\nto create the ‘sink.’ We should thus employ “an ideal way of obtaining\r\nmotor power,” and incidentally rebuke the narrow-minded physics of\r\nCarnot and Lord Kelvin.\r\n\r\nBy means of his electrical oscillator Mr. Tesla has satisfied himself\r\nthat he can transmit electrical energy in large quantities without\r\nwires. He expects that this can be done to great economic advantage.\r\nThen would come the golden age. “Men could settle down everywhere,\r\nfertilize and irrigate the soil with little effort, and convert barren\r\ndeserts into gardens, and thus the entire globe could be transformed\r\nand made a fitter abode for mankind.”\r\n\r\nThe golden age figures largely in Mr. Tesla’s article; he offers us all\r\nthat is entrancing and wonderful. He is generous. We ask for the bread\r\nof definite facts of science and intelligible evidence, but he gives\r\nus the amethyst and topaz and diamonds of an ambient medium doing all\r\nour work and the atmosphere transporting all our motive power and the\r\ntyrant gravity held powerless by a screen, and Mr. Tesla correcting\r\nLord Kelvin’s errors. Still amethyst and topaz and diamonds are only\r\nstones. They may dazzle the magazine reader, but they do not nourish\r\nthe student of science.\r\n\r\nThe editorial department of the _Century Magazine_ perhaps felt that\r\nthese jewels were a bit too bright. We read there that “much that\r\nmust seem speculative to the layman can take its proper place only in\r\nthe purview of the scientist.” Some conservative scientists will feel\r\nlike growling, “And much that must seem bosh to the man of science can\r\ntake its proper place only in the purview of the editorial departments\r\nof popular magazines.” Leaving aside the present case, it is a fact\r\nthat the same care which is exercised by editors to secure in their\r\ncontributions excellence of style and syntax, a proper moral tone and\r\nfreedom from advertisement of business ventures, is not exercised to\r\nsecure accuracy in statements of fact or decent credibility in matters\r\nof theory. The editors apparently impute to their readers a desire to\r\nbe entertained at all costs. They descend to a footing with the Sunday\r\nnewspaper instead of trying to rise to the level of such scientific\r\nliterature as Huxley or Tyndall gave us. They evidently often do not\r\nknow science from rubbish and apparently seldom make any effort to\r\nfind out the difference. They should at least submit their scientific\r\nliterature to competent men for criticism and revision.\r\n\r\nThe general public is helpless before any supposedly scientific\r\nstatement. It may judge vaguely by the standing of the paper or\r\nmagazine or book containing it, by the name of the writer or by the\r\ngeneral tone in which the article is written. But it cannot judge\r\ndefinitely by comparison with relevant facts or by critically examining\r\nthe logic of the deductions, for the general public lacks both\r\nknowledge of the relevant facts and training in logical criticism. That\r\na man should invent a microscope which will enable one to see objects\r\na million times as small as can be seen with the naked eye seems no\r\nmore questionable to the general public than that a man should cause\r\nunfertilized eggs to develop. Yet the first would be impossible while\r\nthe second has been possible, probable, and still more lately proved.\r\nGuidance in scientific matters should be welcome if only for the\r\nprotection thus given against fraudulent medicines, bogus inventions\r\nand nonsensical enterprises.\r\n\r\n    PHYSICIST.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCIENTIFIC LITERATURE.\r\n\r\n\r\n_MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS._\r\n\r\nThe memoirs presented to the Cambridge Philosophical Society on the\r\noccasion of the jubilee of Sir George Stokes, have been published\r\nin a stately volume by the Cambridge University Press. A year ago\r\nsome four hundred men of science met at Cambridge to celebrate the\r\nfiftieth anniversary of the appointment of Sir George Stokes to the\r\nLucasian professorship of mathematics, a chair held by Newton and\r\na distinguished line of mathematicians. An official account of the\r\nproceedings, with a portrait of Professor Stokes, is given in the\r\nvolume now issued. The seventy-two institutions sending delegates are\r\narranged chronologically in the order of their foundation, and it is\r\nnot unworthy of note that among the sixteen oldest institutions, the\r\nUnited States has five representatives, whereas Great Britain has\r\nthirteen universities and colleges younger than the Johns Hopkins\r\nUniversity. The Rede lecture given by M. Alfred Cornu and entitled\r\n‘La théorie des ondes lumineuses,’ is published in French, even the\r\nquotations from Newton’s ‘Opticks’ being translated into that language.\r\nM. Cornu states that by ‘une étude approfondie’ of the ‘Opticks,’\r\nhis lecture shows that Newton favored Descartes’s undulatory theory\r\nof light, rather than the emission theory usually attributed to him.\r\nThe twenty-two memoirs that follow cover a wide range of subjects,\r\nnearly all of which have, however, a connection with the researches\r\nof Professor Stokes. They include three contributions from the United\r\nStates, mathematical papers by Profs. E. W. Brown and E. O. Lovett, and\r\na description by Professor Michelson of his echelon spectroscope.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this memorial volume, the Cambridge University Press,\r\nwhich is represented in America by The Macmillan Company, is at\r\npresent publishing the collected papers of three eminent students of\r\nmathematical physics. The first volume of Lord Rayleigh’s ‘Scientific\r\nPapers’ contains seventy-eight contributions published from 1869 to\r\n1881. The early papers show the influence of Maxwell, Lord Rayleigh’s\r\npredecessor in the chair of experimental physics at Cambridge, but it\r\nwas apparently not until 1881 that he fully appreciated the importance\r\nof Maxwell’s electro-magnetic theory of light. The papers on acoustics\r\nwere followed by the publication in 1877 of the classical work on the\r\n‘Theory of Sound.’ Lord Rayleigh, at an early period, treated various\r\noptical subjects, including some of the phenomena of color vision.\r\nHis explanation of the blue color of the sky and his treatment of\r\nthe resolving power of telescopes are well known. The contributions\r\non optics and acoustics have been continued to the present time, but\r\nthey by no means limit his interests. There are important papers on\r\nhydrodynamics and mathematics, and longer and shorter contributions on\r\na great range of subjects in mathematical physics, the science which at\r\nthe present day is perhaps of supreme importance.\r\n\r\nThe second volume of Professor Tait’s ‘Scientific Papers’ contains\r\nthose published since 1881. The first volume consisted of sixty\r\npapers, and this volume, which has followed with but little delay,\r\nadds seventy-three. As must be the case in collected papers, some are\r\nelaborate treatises while others fill only part of a single page;\r\nsome are extremely technical while others were first published in the\r\n‘Encyclopædia Britannica’ and the ‘Contemporary Review.’ Among the\r\nmore elaborate papers are those on the physical properties of water\r\ncontributed to ‘The Voyage of H. M. S. Challenger,’ on the kinetic\r\ntheory of gases, on impact and on quaternions.\r\n\r\nThe third series just published by the Cambridge Press is the ‘Papers\r\non Mechanical and Physical Subjects’, by Prof. Osborne Reynolds, of\r\nOwens College. The first volume contains forty papers from transactions\r\nand journals issued from 1869 to 1882. The most elaborate memoir is\r\nthat on certain dimensional properties of matter in the gaseous state,\r\nwhich includes experiments on thermal transpiration of gases through\r\nporous plates and a theoretical extension of the dynamic theory of\r\ngas. Many of the papers, such as those on meteorological phenomena\r\nand the steering of vessels, are of popular interest. The Cambridge\r\nUniversity Press is performing a work of the utmost value to science\r\nin undertaking the publication of these great volumes, and we can only\r\nregret that, in spite of the beginnings made at Johns Hopkins, Chicago,\r\nPennsylvania and Columbia, American men of science have no such\r\nopportunities for the publication of their works as those afforded at\r\nCambridge and Oxford.\r\n\r\n\r\n_BOTANY._\r\n\r\nThat a large amount of popular interest centers in the study of tree\r\nlife and all subjects incidental to forestry and horticulture is\r\nevidenced by the appearance of a second book on the subject under the\r\ntitle of ‘Our Native Trees and How to Identify Them’ (Scribners), by\r\nHarriet L. Keeler. The volume in question takes up the trees native of\r\nnorthern United States east of the Rocky Mountains, together with a few\r\nwell-known foreign species which have become naturalized in this region.\r\n\r\nThe book opens with a key to the families of dicotyledonous species\r\nbased upon leaf characters, and every species receives not only a full\r\ntechnical description, but also comes in for interesting comments\r\nupon habit and general ecological relations. Numerous drawings and\r\nhalf-tones add to the accuracy and clearness of the descriptions. It\r\nis not too much to say that the photographic reproductions surpass in\r\nbeauty and presentation of detail any recent botanical publication, and\r\nthe venation of leaves is shown in most instances by this method quite\r\nas well as it might be done by means of pen and ink sketches. The value\r\nof the descriptions is heightened by the inclusion of notes of economic\r\ninterest. It is not unexpected that some errors should creep into the\r\ndiscussions on almost all phases of botany which are interspersed\r\nthroughout the volume.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of a new botanical dictionary is most timely, and it\r\nis fortunate that the task of its preparation should be undertaken\r\nby such a skilful bibliographer as Mr. B. D. Jackson. His ‘Glossary\r\nof Botanical Terms’ (Lippincott) contains fifteen thousand words,\r\nor three times as many as have been included in any previous work\r\nof this character. This is indicative of a most energetic pursuit\r\nof investigations in all departments of the subject, and also of a\r\nlamentable tendency to the coinage by botanists of new and unnecessary\r\nterms upon the slightest pretext. A legitimate factor in the increase\r\nof the contents of such a work consists in the inclusion of words in\r\ncommon use which take on a technical meaning in botany; such, for\r\ninstance, as altitude, abnormal, abrupt, absolute, accidental back, etc.\r\n\r\nDerivations are given, but the history of the terms has not been\r\nattempted. According to the author, ‘anlage’ may be variously rendered\r\nas _rudiment_, _inception_ or _primordium_. ‘Chlorophyll’ receives the\r\ndouble consonant at the end of the last syllable against the popular\r\nextra-botanical practice. Regarding ‘medullary’ the author says: “I\r\nhave given the accent as it is always spoken (medul’-lary) though all\r\nof the dictionaries (_botanical?_) accent it as med’-ullary except\r\nHenslow’s.” In this the author had in mind the practice among his\r\ninsular colleagues only, since the latter pronunciation is given in\r\nthe Standard, Century and Webster’s Dictionaries and is followed by\r\nnine tenths of the American botanists. “Mycorhizome = mycorrhiza-like\r\nstructures in Corallorhiza and Epipogum roots,” and “Mycorrhiza =\r\nsymbiotic fungi on the roots of plants, prothallia, etc.,” are not only\r\nincongruous with orthography and botanical fact, but also with the\r\nusage of all recent writers on this subject.\r\n\r\nWhile many other errors of this character could be adduced, the general\r\nvalue of the book is scarcely lessened, and it will be of the greatest\r\nservice to the working botanist, not only in raising the general\r\nliterary tone of his writings, but also in placing at his command a\r\nchoice of all of the established terms dealing with any phase of the\r\nsubject; an aid which will be greatly conducive to increased accuracy\r\nof statement.\r\n\r\nA decade since, the majority of the botanists engaged in the study\r\nof the distribution of plants on this continent, as well as the\r\nstrict systematists, were quite unanimously of the opinion that the\r\nterritory within the boundaries of the United States had been quite\r\nthoroughly explored, and that the task of the collector are well-nigh\r\ndone. Despite this discouraging conclusion a few enthusiastic workers\r\nhave not intermitted their labors in a more critical consideration of\r\nthe floras of the newer and less thickly settled regions, with the\r\nresult that scores and hundreds of new species have been brought to\r\nlight each year, and the awakening interest in the subject promises a\r\nre-exploration of the great West.\r\n\r\nA striking example of the results awaiting the student in this line is\r\nafforded by Dr. Rydberg’s ‘Flora of Montana and the Yellowstone Park’\r\n(New York Botanical Garden), which has recently appeared. Although\r\nthe first collections of plants in this region were made by the Lewis\r\nand Clarke expedition nearly a century ago, Dr. Ryberg finds 163 new\r\nspecies and varieties in the 1,976 which he lists in this volume.\r\nOf this number 487 are found on both the eastern and western slopes\r\nof the continental divide, 268 on the eastern side only, 520 on the\r\nwestern side only, 42 of which are arctic and inhabit the high mountain\r\nsummits, and 659 which have originated in the exact region under\r\ndiscussion. Seven hundred and seventy-six of the species listed were\r\nnot included in Coulter’s ‘Rocky Mountain Botany,’ published a few\r\nyears ago.\r\n\r\nThe symposium on the ‘Plant Geography of North American,’ to be given\r\nat the coming meeting of the American Association for the Advancement\r\nof Science, will do much to systematize investigations of this\r\ncharacter and broaden the method of treatment accorded the subject in\r\nthe future.\r\n\r\n\r\n_BIOLOGY._\r\n\r\nThe ‘Biological Lectures from the Marine Laboratory of Woods Holl,\r\n1899,’ make up a volume of about three hundred pages which represent\r\nfairly the present tendencies of biological investigation in this\r\ncountry. The most striking things about the lectures are the wide range\r\nof topics which they treat, and the first-hand quality of the subject\r\nmatter in each case. This is most clearly seen by a careful reading of\r\nthe text, but a mere enumeration of a few of the sixteen titles and\r\nlectures makes it fairly obvious. Thus, D. P. Penhallow writes on ‘The\r\nNature of the Evidence Exhibited by Fossil Plants, and its bearing upon\r\nour Knowledge of the History of Plant Life;’ D. T. MacDougal writes\r\non the ‘Significance of Mycorrhizas,’ Edward Thorndike on ‘Instinct,’\r\nHerbert S. Jennings on ‘The Behavior of Unicellular Organisms,’ Alpheus\r\nHyatt on ‘Some Governing Factors usually neglected in Biological\r\nInvestigations,’ T. H. Morgan on ‘Regeneration,’ C. B. Davenport on\r\n‘The Aims of the Quantitative Study of Variation,’ Jacques Loeb on ‘The\r\nNature of the Process of Fertilization.’\r\n\r\nTo the professed scientist these lectures will furnish expert opinion\r\non certain important topics; the general reader will find in them a\r\npresentation not too technical or detailed. Professor Loeb’s lecture,\r\nfor example, is for such readers the best account yet given of his\r\nexperiments in artificial fertilization.\r\n\r\nThe range and originality which characterize these lectures are really\r\ncharacteristic of the general work and spirit of the Woods Holl\r\nLaboratory. Few people realize the amount of research work which is\r\ndone there from summer to summer. Yet last year there were seventy-one\r\ninvestigators there. Moreover, these represent a superior selection\r\nfrom among the instructors and students of the various colleges.\r\n\r\nIt is a symptom of a healthy, vigorous condition in biological science\r\nthat the best workers of the country are glad to devote their vacation\r\nseason to research, and it is highly creditable to the Woods Holl\r\nmanagement that it offers them such attractive facilities. Similar\r\nsummer laboratories are now being established in other parts of the\r\ncountry, and are to be reckoned with as very important factors in the\r\nprogress of biology.\r\n\r\n\r\n_CYTOLOGY._\r\n\r\nIt is a somewhat surprising fact that among educated people of\r\nscientific training there prevails generally the greatest ignorance as\r\nto some of the most important problems of biology. We refer to those\r\nproblems connected with the structure and functions of the animal and\r\nplant cell. Men who can understand and appreciate recent discoveries in\r\nastronomy, physics, chemistry and geology are usually wholly lost in\r\ncytology. In fact, in general writing or speech it is not safe to use\r\nthis name without at once defining it, since it is commonly supposed to\r\nbe a mispronunciation or a stupid misspelling of ‘psychology,’ while\r\nto most people _nuclei_, _chromosomes_, _centrosomes_ and _mitotic\r\nspindles_ are words without meaning, signifying nothing.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this is twofold: First, cytology is one of the newest\r\nof the biological sciences and it has but recently found its way into\r\ncollege curricula, and second, there have been few text-books or\r\ngeneral works on this subject to which an intelligent layman could turn\r\nfor information.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, in spite of this fact, there are few fields of scientific\r\nwork possessing more general interest than that of cytology. At the\r\npresent day the greatest problems of biology are centered in the cell.\r\nAssimilation, growth, metabolism, reproduction, differentiation,\r\ninheritance and variation--these are at bottom cellular phenomena, the\r\nresult of the structure and functions of cells. It is not surprising,\r\ntherefore, that “all the searchlights of science have been turned\r\nupon the cell,” and that cell studies during the past ten years have\r\nreceived an amount of attention which is comparable only to that\r\ndevoted to evolution under the stimulus of Darwin’s work.\r\n\r\nProfessor Wilson’s book on the cell,[F] the second edition of which\r\nhas just appeared, is a work of more than ordinary interest, not only\r\nto the biologist, but to all persons who are interested in the general\r\nadvance of science. Although there are several other good text-books\r\nof cytology which have appeared during the past five or six years,\r\nProfessor Wilson’s book, in thoroughness of treatment, in philosophical\r\ninsight, in clearness and forcefulness of style and in wealth and\r\nbeauty of illustrations, easily surpasses them all.\r\n\r\n    [F] The Cell in Development and Inheritance. Edmund B. Wilson.\r\n        Second Edition Revised and Enlarged. Columbia University\r\n        Biological Series IV. New York and London, The Macmillan\r\n        Co., 1900. Pp. xxi, 483 with 194 Figures in the Text. $3.50\r\n\r\nIt is impossible in this brief note to give any adequate summary of\r\nthe volume or of the position of the author on questions of general\r\ninterest; the subjects of the chapters, however, may serve to give some\r\nidea as to the scope of the work. After an introduction which gives a\r\nbrief historical sketch of the cell theory and its relation to the\r\nevolution theory, there are taken up in successive chapters a general\r\nsketch of cell structure, cell division, the germ cells, fertilization\r\nof the ovum, the formation of the germ cells and the halving of their\r\nnuclei preparatory to fertilization, cell organs and their relations\r\nto each other and to the life of the cell, cell chemistry and cell\r\nphysiology, cell division in its relation to the development of the\r\negg, and finally, some theories of inheritance and development. In\r\naddition, there is appended an excellent glossary and a list of all the\r\nmost important literature on the subject up to the current year.\r\n\r\nWhile the work is undoubtedly intended as a reference book for\r\ninvestigators and advanced students in biology, being marked by the\r\nthoroughness of treatment of an original communication, it is yet\r\nso well written and so copiously illustrated as to make it not only\r\nintelligible but also intensely interesting to the general reader.\r\n\r\n\r\n_EDUCATION._\r\n\r\nThe most important recent book on education is undoubtedly ‘Education\r\nin the United States,’ a book prepared in connection with the\r\neducational exhibit of this country at the Paris Exposition. It\r\nconsists of a series of monographs which cover all the important\r\nphases of educational endeavor in the United States. The two volumes\r\ninclude nearly a thousand pages, almost all of which present\r\ndefinite and reliable facts. Only rarely is there any indulgence in\r\nexpressions of private opinion, and still more rarely is such opinion\r\nquestionable. The editor is justified in his statement that the book\r\nis ‘a cross-section view of education in the United States in 1900.’\r\nIt will be of great value to the student of American institutions or\r\nof education in general, and should be of interest to any citizen who\r\ndesires to be well informed about his country. The quality of the\r\nmonographs will be evident from the list of the author’s names. For\r\ninstance, those writing on higher education are Prof. A. F. West, of\r\nPrinceton; Prof. E. D. Perry, of Columbia; President Thomas, of Bryn\r\nMawr; Director Parsons, of the University of the State of New York;\r\nPresident Mendenhall, of the Worcester Polytechnic Institute, and Prof.\r\nH. B. Adams, of Johns Hopkins.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PROGRESS OF SCIENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe conditions in the United States have been favorable to the\r\ndevelopment of geology. The varied forms of the land have offered\r\nabundant opportunities for research, whereas the practical value of\r\nthe work has led to the establishment of surveys, the magnitude of\r\nwhose contribution to geology is only known to special students. The\r\nGeological Society of America has about two hundred and fifty members,\r\nnearly all of whom are actively engaged in geological research, perhaps\r\na larger number than in any other science. The U. S. Geological\r\nSurvey is the center of this movement, and its great efficiency is in\r\nlarge measure due to Mr. G. K. Gilbert, now president of the American\r\nAssociation for the Advancement of Science. He was born in Rochester,\r\nN. Y., in 1843, and after graduating from the university in that city,\r\nacted for five years as assistant in the Ward Museum, where a number\r\nof eminent naturalists have been trained. He then became geologist\r\nin the Ohio Survey under Newberry, was engaged in the Wheeler and\r\nPowell Surveys, and has been geologist in the U. S. Geological Survey\r\nsince its establishment in 1879. In the arid west, where the face of\r\nthe earth is bare, Mr. Gilbert made the observations and discoveries\r\nin dynamical and physical geology which have done so much toward the\r\nmaking of the science of physiography. His monographs on the Henry\r\nMountains and on Lake Bonneville, the name he gave to the ancient lake\r\nthat once filled the Utah basin, are models, both in regard to their\r\noriginal discoveries and the methods of presentation. He has extended\r\nhis studies to the basins of the Laurentian Lakes and to other regions,\r\nalways with important results. Mr. Gilbert has been president of the\r\nAmerican Society of Naturalists, the Geological Society of America and\r\nthe Philosophical Society of Washington, and has received the Wollaston\r\nMedal of the Geological Society of London. His presidential address\r\nbefore the American Association will be given at the American Museum of\r\nNatural History, New York City, on the evening of June 26, his subject\r\nbeing ‘Geological Rhythm.’\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe meeting of the American Association in New York City, opening as\r\nthis issue of the MONTHLY is published, promises to be of more than\r\nusual importance. The preliminary programs of the different sections\r\nshow long lists of valuable papers and promise the attendance of\r\nleading men of science from all parts of the country. A movement of\r\ninterest is the increasing tendency of special scientific societies\r\nto meet in conjunction with the Association. No less than fifteen\r\nsocieties will this year hold their sessions at Columbia University,\r\nsome of them joining with the sections of the Association, and\r\nothers holding independent meetings. The members of these different\r\nsocieties have the advantage of the reduced railway rates and other\r\narrangements which can be made once for all, and the still greater\r\nadvantage of meeting scientific men in other departments. As science\r\ngrows in details and in range, there is on the one hand an increased\r\nspecialization, making it desirable for small groups of experts to\r\nmeet together to discuss their special problems, while, on the other\r\nhand, almost every scientific question has ramifications extending to\r\nmany sciences. Hence, the need of many separate societies and at the\r\nsame time of a common meeting ground. When the American Association\r\nwas organized, in 1848, its members could meet in one body; later\r\nthey divided into two sections, one for the exact sciences and one\r\nfor natural history. In 1882 nine sections were organized, but it was\r\nnot until 1892 that botany was separated from zoölogy. At present\r\nthe sections no longer suffice, and there must be either a further\r\nsub-division and a more efficient organization of the sections, or the\r\nAmerican Association must become an administrative body, that will\r\narrange for the simultaneous meetings of independent societies and the\r\nunion of these societies in support of their common interests.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe obvious advantages of meeting together have now led nearly all the\r\nnational scientific societies to select either the time of the American\r\nAssociation or Christmas week for joint meetings. It is unfortunate\r\nthat they should be divided into two groups, and it must be admitted\r\nthat neither midsummer nor the Christmas holidays are altogether\r\nsuitable for the meetings. The American Association has this year made\r\nthe experiment of selecting the end of June, immediately after the\r\nclose of the college sessions, instead of a week in August. This has\r\nsome advantages, but even at the beginning of the summer many men of\r\nscience are either abroad or are engaged in scientific expeditions. The\r\nheat is apt to be excessive, interfering not only with the meetings,\r\nbut also requiring some self-sacrifice on the part of scientific men\r\nwhen they leave their comfortable summer homes to travel through heat\r\nand dust to a hot and dusty city. Christmas week, divided by Sunday,\r\nis too short for a series of scientific meetings, especially for those\r\nwho must travel from a distance. This led to the organization last\r\nwinter of the Cordillerean Geological Society, the Western Society\r\nof Naturalists and the Western Philosophical Association. Local\r\nassociations are, of course, valuable, but they should not interfere\r\nwith one central meeting in the course of the year. The plan has been\r\nsuggested of taking one week, either immediately after the New Year or\r\nin the early spring, for a general scientific gathering, which would\r\ninclude not only the exact and natural sciences, but also philology,\r\nhistory, etc. The plan would be to secure an adjournment of exercises\r\nor leave of absence in the case of universities, colleges, museums,\r\nGovernment departments, etc., with the understanding that it would be\r\nthe duty of all those who were released from their regular work to\r\nattend the meetings.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe American Association last met in New York City in 1887, though\r\nthere was a meeting in Brooklyn in 1894. The past thirteen and even\r\nthe past six years have witnessed an extraordinary development in the\r\neducational and scientific institutions of the city. Columbia College\r\nand New York University have developed into great universities, each\r\nhaving found a new site and erected upon it buildings which might have\r\nbeen expected to come only as the growth of a century. The American\r\nMuseum of Natural History has become one of the great museums of the\r\nworld, millions of dollars having been spent on buildings. A botanical\r\ngarden and a zoölogical park have been established, which promise to\r\nrival those of any of the European capitals. A well-equipped aquarium\r\nhas been opened under the auspices of the city; the Metropolitan\r\nMuseum of Art has been entirely rebuilt to accommodate its increasing\r\ncollections; a magnificent building is in course of erection for the\r\nPublic Library to contain its great assemblage of books, which with\r\nits endowment is largely the result of recent years. While Boston\r\nand Philadelphia have made great advances within the last few years,\r\nand Washington has become the chief scientific center of the United\r\nStates, it is especially noteworthy that New York City has enjoyed an\r\neducational and scientific development commensurate with its material\r\nresources.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJonas G. Clark, who ten years ago established at Worcester a\r\nuniversity and christened it with his name, has died and left to\r\nthe university several hundred thousand dollars, and on certain\r\nconditions practically the whole of his estate, which is said to\r\nbe between five and ten million dollars. The will is a complicated\r\ndocument with numerous codicils, somewhat difficult to interpret and\r\nlikely to give rise to legal complications. The history of Clark\r\nUniversity has been curious and interesting. As in the case of the\r\nJohns Hopkins University, there was a difference of opinion between\r\nthe founder and the president as to the scope of the institution. In\r\nboth cases the founder had in view a more or less local college, while\r\nthe president believed that we had colleges in sufficient number, but\r\nneeded in the United States universities on German models, but going\r\neven further than Germany in making research rather than instruction\r\nthe primary object of the institution. Johns Hopkins died very soon\r\nafter the establishment of his university, and though there was for a\r\nwhile a good deal of difference of opinion in the board of trustees,\r\nthe university idea triumphed. A college was, however, established\r\nin connection with it. At Clark University the founder lived for ten\r\nyears, and appears to have altered several times his point of view. He\r\nwithdrew his support, and the university work which began brilliantly\r\nwas much reduced in range and quality. The greater part of the faculty\r\nremoved in a body to the University of Chicago. It appears that at this\r\ntime Mr. Clark bequeathed his money to the university only on condition\r\nthat the president should resign, but later devised a compromise by\r\nwhich the university should continue as at present, while a partly\r\nindependent college should be established in conjunction with it. The\r\ninterpretation of the will, the value of the estate and the development\r\nof the university open problems that will only be settled in the course\r\nof time.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEuropeans who look upon the United States as a material and commercial\r\nnation must find it difficult to interpret the great gifts that are\r\ncontinually made for the cause of higher education. Twenty-five years\r\nago there were in America no universities in the sense in which the\r\nterm is most properly employed. During this comparatively brief period\r\nthe older institutions have become universities, and the great increase\r\nin expenditure has been met chiefly by voluntary contributions. The\r\nannual expenditure, for example, at Harvard and Columbia Universities\r\nis about a half million dollars beyond the tuition fees, and the money\r\ninvested in grounds and buildings, is in the case of either university\r\nmany millions. Then this period has witnessed the establishment of new\r\nuniversities, rivaling in endowment the older institutions. The Johns\r\nHopkins University and Clark University have been mentioned above, but\r\nthe most noteworthy instances are the University of Chicago, to which\r\none benefactor still living has given eight million dollars, and Leland\r\nStanford Junior University, the endowment of which reaches the enormous\r\nsum of thirty-five million dollars. At the same time, the State\r\nuniversities, directly supported by the people, are beginning to rival\r\nprivately endowed institutions. It may be confidently asserted that no\r\nnation has ever so liberally supported higher education, and the wisdom\r\nof this liberality is now demonstrated, even from the most mercenary\r\npoint of view, by the place the United States has taken in the world’s\r\ncommerce. It will be still further demonstrated in the course of the\r\nnext twenty-five years. It is possible that existing conditions are not\r\nfavorable to literature and to art, but the future of science in the\r\nUnited States is assured beyond question.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes said that Government control and individual initiative\r\ncan not be united, but there is no justification for this view in the\r\ndevelopment of the educational and scientific institutions of the\r\nUnited States. Institutions established by private initiative have\r\nbeen assisted by the State, and State institutions have received large\r\nsums from private individuals. The New York institutions referred to\r\nabove--the American Museum of Natural History, the Metropolitan Museum\r\nof Art, the Public Library, the Botanical Gardens and the Zoölogical\r\nPark--are in almost equal measure supported by the city and by citizens\r\nof the city. Johns Hopkins University, the University of Pennsylvania,\r\nCornell University and other privately endowed institutions have\r\nreceived assistance from the State, without any decrease in private\r\ngifts, while the State universities, California for example, are\r\nreceiving large private endowments in addition to their support from\r\nthe State. These conditions may not last, but at all events they obtain\r\nat the present time, and we find the country in which the largest gifts\r\nfrom private individuals are made for education and science to be the\r\ncountry in which they are most liberally supported by the Government.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNever before has any government made such great appropriations for\r\nthe development of the resources of the country or for the advance\r\nof science as the Congress which has just adjourned. We may take for\r\nexample the Department of Agriculture, for which the appropriation is\r\n$4,023,500, an increase of more than $280,000 over the appropriation\r\nfor the preceding year. Every one familiar with the conditions at\r\nWashington and throughout the country will know that this large sum of\r\nmoney is expended with the utmost economy, and there is no doubt but\r\nwhat the money invested by the nation is returned to the people many\r\nfold in the course of every year. Some of the items of the bill deserve\r\nspecial notice. Thus, a new agricultural experiment station is to be\r\nestablished in the Hawaiian Islands, and the work of the Weather Bureau\r\nis to be extended to them. The agricultural resources and capabilities\r\nof Porto Rico are to be investigated, and bulletins of information in\r\nEnglish and in Spanish are to be distributed to the inhabitants. The\r\ndivision of chemistry is to investigate the use of food preservatives\r\nand coloring matter, determine their relations to health and establish\r\nthe principles which should guide their use. The division of forestry\r\nreceives an increase of $40,000 and the Weather Bureau an increase of\r\nover $35,000. Other items of the appropriation act are as follows:\r\nBiological Survey, $30,300, an increase of $2,740; Division of Botany,\r\n$43,080, an increase of $14,280; Nutrition Investigation, $17,500, an\r\nincrease of $2,500; Division of Pomology, $18,400; Public Road Inquiry,\r\n$14,000, an increase of $6,000; Division of Statistics, $146,160;\r\nLibrary, $14,000; and Museum, $2,260.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhile American men of wealth have given freely of their means for the\r\npromotion of education and science, they have not so often devoted\r\ntheir own time to its service. This is natural, as the wealth has\r\nin most cases been acquired by the present generation, and it is\r\nin succeeding generations, when families have been established,\r\nthat leisure and wealth will give a class similar to that which has\r\naccomplished so much for Great Britain and to a lesser extent for\r\nGermany and France. Still, it is the case that the heads of two of\r\nour chief universities are men of great wealth, who have devoted not\r\nonly their means, but also their services to the cause of education,\r\nand there are in our universities and other institutions many who\r\nhold their positions purely out of interest in their work, not as a\r\nmeans for their support. In the next generation there will probably be\r\nmore representatives of a class to which belonged the Duke of Argyll,\r\nwhose death we were compelled to record last month. Another man has\r\nsince died of a somewhat similar type. When Colonel Lane-Fox somewhat\r\nunexpectedly succeeded to large estates in Wiltshire and Dorsetshire\r\nand assumed the name Pitt-Rivers, his chief interest seemed to be\r\nin the earth works and tumuli of Cranbourne Chase, and the extensive\r\nmemoirs he has published and the museum he has established show what\r\ngood use he made of the excavations. Some of the results of his earlier\r\nwork will be found at Oxford, but he built at Farnham, in Dorsetshire,\r\na museum which contains collections of the greatest possible value.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe communication in this issue signed ‘Physicist’ is worthy of note.\r\nIf what its writer says is true, it is evident that a reputation as a\r\nbrilliant inventor does not insure that its possessor is a safe writer\r\nabout general physics. Our correspondent, who represents fairly the\r\nopinion of scientific men in general, finds fault with Mr. Tesla’s\r\narticle in the June _Century_ in many important particulars. During the\r\nyears since Mr. Tesla’s notable invention of the polyphase alternate\r\ncurrent transformer, he seems to have become less definite and exact\r\nin his thinking, and less productive as an inventor. The speculation\r\nand rhetoric of the _Century_ article are certainly disappointing to\r\nevery one who is trying to bring about an intelligent and sound view of\r\nscience on the part of non-scientific people. Men of science everywhere\r\nshould certainly make it their business to instruct people in general\r\nabout the progress, and even the prospects, of science through the\r\npress, but it takes wisdom on the part of both writers and editors to\r\nknow what is instructive and what is misleading. Honest criticism such\r\nas that of our correspondent is therefore highly desirable.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is generally agreed that the most important advance of last year in\r\nthe science of medicine was the discovery that the parasite causing\r\nmalaria was transmitted from person to person by mosquitoes. Dr. Manson\r\ndescribes this discovery fully in this number of the POPULAR SCIENCE\r\nMONTHLY. This summer a crucial experiment is being made of a somewhat\r\ndramatic character. A mosquito-proof tent has been constructed, which\r\nis located in Italy, in the Campagna. In this Dr. Luigi Sambon,\r\nlecturer of the London Tropical School of Medicine, and Dr. G. C.\r\nLow will live until October, taking the utmost care not to be bitten\r\nby mosquitoes. If they escape malaria it will serve as corroborative\r\nevidence that the mosquito is the means of infection. On the other\r\nhand, several Englishmen, including Dr. Manson’s son, have offered\r\nthemselves as subjects for the complementary experiment. They will\r\nlive in a healthy district, but will definitely allow themselves to be\r\nbitten by mosquitoes which are known to be infected. These experiments\r\nwill probably be particularly useful in demonstrating to the public at\r\nlarge the validity of the hypothesis derived last year from technical\r\nbacteriological evidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscribers’ Notes\r\n\r\n\r\nPunctuation, hyphenation, and spelling were made consistent when a\r\npredominant preference was found in this book; otherwise they were not\r\nchanged. Inconsistent spacing in abbreviations was not changed.\r\n\r\nSimple typographical errors were corrected; occasional unbalanced\r\nquotation marks retained.\r\n\r\nAmbiguous hyphens at the ends of lines were retained.\r\n\r\nPage 230: “spectrograph” was misprinted as “spectograph”; corrected\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nPage 315: “sporozooites” was printed that way.\r\n\r\nPage 322: “uranium oxids” was printed that way.\r\n\r\nPage 329: “‘Plant Geography of North American,’” may be a misprint\r\nfor “America”.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Popular Science Monthly, July, 1900, by Various",
