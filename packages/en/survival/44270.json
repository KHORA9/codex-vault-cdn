The\r\ncontroversies over the interpretation of the curious markings of Mars\r\nand the wide divergence of opinion as to their nature first turned my\r\nattention to the matter. The question of intelligence in other worlds\r\nis of perennial interest to everyone, and that question may possibly\r\nbe settled by an unprejudiced study of our neighboring planet Mars.\r\nKnowing the many analogies between Mars and the Earth, we are justified\r\nin asking what conditions really exist in Mars. Instead of flouting at\r\nevery attempt to interpret the various and complicated markings of its\r\nsurface, we should soberly consider any rational explanation of these\r\nenigmas from the postulate that the two spheres, so near together in\r\nspace, cannot be so far apart physically, and from the fact that as\r\nintelligence is broadly modifying the appearance of the surface of the\r\nEarth, a similar intelligence may also be marking the face of Mars.\r\n\r\nA student familiar with a general knowledge of the heavens, a\r\nfair acquaintance with the surface features of the Earth, with an\r\nappreciation of the doctrine of probabilities, and capable of\r\nestimating the value of evidence, is quite as well equipped to examine\r\nand discuss the nature of the markings of Mars as the astronomer.\r\nIf, furthermore, he is gifted with imagination and is free from all\r\nprejudice in the matter, he may have a slight advantage. Astronomers\r\nare probably the most exact of all students as to their facts, and in\r\nthis discussion there is no attempt to introduce evidence they do not\r\nsupply, as the frequent quotations from their writings will show.\r\n\r\nHaving studied Mars through nearly one presentation of the planet with\r\nthe great refractor at the Lowell Observatory, what I saw with my own\r\neyes, uninfluenced by what others saw, will be presented in a short\r\nchapter at the end of this book.\r\n\r\nI wish to express my obligations to Professor Percival Lowell for the\r\nprivileges of his observatory, for many of the illustrations in this\r\nbook, and for his unbounded hospitality during my visit to Flagstaff.\r\nI am also deeply indebted to Mr. Russell Robb for valuable assistance\r\nduring the preparation of the manuscript.\r\n\r\n      E.

Shall we ever know? the question\r\nwould not have been deemed worthy of a second thought. Realizing\r\nwhat has been accomplished, not only regarding the constitution of\r\nthe Sun, but of the most remote stars, we are encouraged to ask: Is\r\nMars inhabited? Shall we ever know? To what groups of students are\r\nwe to appeal for an answer? If we want to know the diameter of Mars,\r\nits weight, the form of its orbit, the inclination of its axis, the\r\nperiod of its revolution around the Sun, and its rotation period,\r\nits ephemeris and its albedo, we ask the astronomer, for he has the\r\ninstruments with which to observe and measure, and the mathematical\r\nknowledge necessary to reduce the measurements. If Mars were\r\nincandescent, we should appeal to the astrophysicist for information\r\nregarding its chemical composition. If, however, we want to know the\r\nprobability of Mars being the abode of life, we should appeal to one\r\nwho is familiar with the conditions of life upon our own globe. If the\r\nquestion is asked as to the existence of intelligence on the planet,\r\nwe endeavor to trace evidences of its surface markings, and their\r\ncharacter, whether natural or artificial. Knowing how profoundly man\r\nhas changed the appearance of the surface features of our own globe in\r\nthe removal of vast forests, in the irrigation of enormous tracts of\r\nsterile plain, the filling up of certain areas, like Peking, Tokio,\r\nLondon, with material having a different reflecting surface, we are to\r\nscan the surface of Mars for similar modifications, and for an answer\r\nask those who are familiar with physical geography, with meteorology,\r\nwith geology, including the character of natural cracks or crannies,\r\ndeep cañon, or range of mountains, or any of the great cataclysms which\r\nhave scarred the face of the Earth. Taking the great mass of facts\r\nas they are presented to us by astronomers, to what class are we to\r\nappeal as to the probability of life in other worlds? What class will\r\nform the most rational conclusions? Will it be the circle-squarers,\r\nperpetual-motion cranks, spiritualists, survivals of a past who believe\r\nthe world is flat, those who have \"anthropomorphic conceptions of\r\nthe Supreme\" and Hebraic conceptions of the origin of things, or will\r\nit be those who value observation and experiment, who appreciate the\r\nimportance of large numbers, and who are endowed with a tithe of\r\nimagination? Most certainly the latter class.\r\n\r\nIn approaching the interpretation of the markings of Mars we should\r\nfirst glance at a brief historical summary of what has already been\r\ndone. We should examine the testimony of those who have seen and\r\ndrawn the canals; we are then better prepared to examine the records\r\nof the latest observations and the explanation of their nature. In\r\nthe meantime an inquiry must be made as to whether the mathematical\r\nastronomer, after all, is best fitted to judge of the surface features\r\nof a planet. Next we should take up in the following order the\r\nevidences, which are overwhelming, that a network of lines, geodetic\r\nin their character, mark the surface of Mars. It has been claimed\r\nthat these lines show the result of irrigation, and, therefore, the\r\nirrigation features of our own planet should be examined. It has been\r\nobjected that many astronomers have not been able to see the markings,\r\nand consequently their existence has been doubted. It will then be\r\nproper to point out that the difficulties of seeing are very great,\r\nand that the acutest eyesight, coupled with long practice, is necessary\r\nto recognize the markings. It has been objected that the drawings of\r\nthe minuter details of Mars vary with different observers. It will\r\nbe necessary to show that every kind of research employing graphic\r\nrepresentation labors under the same difficulty, and none more so than\r\nastronomy. It has been objected that there is not sufficient moisture\r\nand atmosphere in Mars to sustain life, and this must be answered by\r\nthose only who are familiar with conditions affecting life on our own\r\nplanet.\r\n\r\nVarious theories have been advanced, some of them physical, to\r\nexplain the markings of Mars, and these must be considered, and, if\r\npossible, answered. Comments and criticism are difficult to repress,\r\nas the discoveries of Schiaparelli and the additional discoveries and\r\ndeductions of Lowell have evoked discussions, which, in some instances,\r\nhave been harsh and unreasonable, and, in one case, positively\r\nridiculous. Schiaparelli has been called an impostor, and Lowell has\r\ncome in for his full share of vituperation and innuendo. If this\r\nportion of the discussion is considered unparliamentary, the attitude\r\nand language of certain astronomers have provoked it.\r\n\r\nA brief account is presented of what the author was enabled to draw of\r\nthe Martian details, with a transcript of his notes made at the time\r\nof observation, and finally a little imaginary sketch is given as to\r\nhow the world would look from Mars; and if similar kinds of astronomers\r\nexisted there, what comments and objections they might offer as to the\r\ninhabitability of the Earth.\r\n\r\nSuch flights of the imagination are justified in that it gives one\r\na chance to appreciate the weakness of some of the arguments urged\r\nagainst the idea of intelligence in Mars.\r\n\r\nIt will be objected that some of the names herein quoted are not\r\nrecognized as astronomers. I can only say that in every instance\r\nI have found references to the writings and essays of those that\r\nmight be objected to in the pages of the \"Observatory,\" and other\r\nreputable astronomical journals, and in no instances accompanied by\r\nadverse comment or criticism. If astronomers--even the distinguished\r\nSchiaparelli--quote these names in scientific memoirs, I may venture to\r\ndo the same in a book written for the general reader. The objection,\r\nhowever, has always presented itself with every controversy; it was\r\nconspicuously marked in the passionate discussions over Darwin's\r\n\"Origin of Species.\" The intelligent laity recognized the truth of\r\nDarwin's proposition long before the zoölogist began to waver. Essays\r\nby the unprofessional supporting Darwin's contention were discredited\r\nbecause the writers were not trained naturalists. The history of\r\ninvention is crowded with instances where devices and processes have\r\nbeen invented by men whose trades or professions were the least likely\r\nto enable them to originate such ideas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nIMMEASURABLE DISTANCES OF SPACE\r\n\r\n        _It is therefore perfectly reasonable to suppose that\r\n        beings not only animated but endowed with reason inhabit\r\n        countless worlds in space._\r\n\r\n                SIMON NEWCOMB.\r\n\r\n\r\nUntil within recent centuries, man has not only believed that he and\r\nhis kind were the only intelligent creatures in the universe, but\r\nthat the little round ball on which he lived was the dominant part\r\nthereof. So rooted for ages was this conviction that it became fixed\r\nin man's mental structure, and hence the survival of the idea that\r\nstill lingers in the minds of a few to-day. The conclusion was natural,\r\nhowever, for the behavior of the starry heavens and the Sun and the\r\nMoon seemed sufficient evidence that man, and the surface upon which\r\nhe lived, was the centre of the universe. The stars were bright points\r\nof light, the Moon a silver disk, and the Sun a heat and light giving\r\nball of fire, equally diminutive and not far away. Let one realize for\r\na moment the experience of these early people. Everything aerial,\r\nwith the exception of feathery birds, fluffy bats and flying insects,\r\nwas composed of the lightest particles--cottony seeds, reluctantly\r\nfalling snow-flakes, motes in the air, smoke and vaporous cloud, and,\r\nin contrast, the rock-foundationed and irregular surface upon which\r\nthe people dwelt, and flat as far as man had reached. What wonder,\r\nthen, that man viewed these brilliant points and dazzling disks as\r\nobjects of no great size and not far away, hauled across the heavens\r\nby unseen spirits of some kind. The marvel of it all is, not that\r\nthey believed as they did, but that any other views of cosmography\r\ncould have been established. And yet the successive increments of\r\nastronomical knowledge, founded apparently on the soundest mathematics,\r\nwere adopted in their turn. What more convincing than the epicyclic\r\ntheory of Ptolemy, buttressed by figures so ingenious and convincing,\r\nthat the theory might have lasted till now except for the truer\r\nunderstanding of planetary movements in relation to that of the Earth?\r\nAll through this history are found traces of the barriers erected by\r\nprejudiced conservatives, of which the attitude of Tycho Brahe is a\r\ngood example, though in this case it was probably his belief in the\r\nHebraic conception of the universe which excited his opposition to\r\nKepler's views, a conception which, unfortunately for the progress of\r\nastronomical research, still lingers among certain observers to-day and\r\nplaces them in precisely the same category with Tycho Brahe.\r\n\r\nWith the gradual accumulation of knowledge it was found that of all\r\nthe innumerable illuminated bodies in the heavens, only one,--just\r\none,--the Moon, revolved around the Earth, and that the Earth instead\r\nof being all dominant in the affairs of the universe, played a very\r\nminor part, and, instead of being master, was a very humble midget\r\nrevolving around the Sun; that, indeed, with the exception of the\r\nMoon, there were visible to the naked eye only three bright points\r\nof light in the whole range of the heavens more insignificant in\r\nsize,--Mercury, Venus, and Mars,--while the other planets were vastly\r\nlarger, and had many more satellites revolving around them. Then it\r\nwas found that, with the exception of the few planets, the myriad\r\nstars had no connection with the Sun whatsoever, that the Sun was\r\nno longer the centre of a great universe. Later it was discovered\r\nthrough spectroscopic analysis that all the myriad of stars were\r\ncomposed of chemical elements similar to our Sun. Here, then, was the\r\nstartling revelation that our Sun was simply a star, and that the stars\r\nrepresented a \"universe of Suns,\" and, if we could get near any one\r\nstar of the millions that sparkle in the heavens telescopically, we\r\nshould see it as a round ball emitting light and heat. It was perhaps\r\nhumiliating to find that our Sun was so insignificant in size that\r\nfrom Sirius, for example, it could not be seen with the naked eye, so\r\nsmall indeed that in the close companionship of other stars it would be\r\nswallowed up by their greater size and brilliancy.\r\n\r\nTo assume, then, that our Sun, so identical to the stars in heat and\r\nlight emitting properties, was the only Sun that had revolving around\r\nit a few minute balls, would be as absurd as if one should go on a\r\npebbly beach, extending from Labrador to Florida for example, and\r\npicking up a single pebble, should have the hardihood to assert that\r\nthis pebble was the only one, among the millions of pebbles, upon which\r\nwould be found the bits of seaweed and little snails which it might\r\nsupport. The overwhelming vastness of the universe is entirely beyond\r\nthe grasp of the human mind. The mere statement that it requires so\r\nmany years for the light to reach us from a certain star, the parallax\r\nof which has been rudely established, affords one only a faint glimmer\r\nof the truth. The swing of our Earth about the Sun gives us a base line\r\nof 186,000,000 of miles, and yet, with this enormous base from which\r\nto subtend an angle, only a very few of the myriad of stars show the\r\nslightest displacement; the others exhibit no more signs of divergence\r\nthan if while looking at them we had simply moved our heads from one\r\nside to the other! Fixed stars they appear to be, and are so called,\r\nthough we are told they are all drifting in various directions, as our\r\nstar-Sun is.\r\n\r\nOnly by reducing all these vast distances and dimensions to a minute\r\nscale can the mind realize the futility of ever comprehending the\r\nillimitable distances of space.\r\n\r\nIn order to consider the attitude of the Earth in relation to the\r\nSun and the nearest fixed star, we will reduce the Sun's diameter of\r\n866,000 miles to the dimensions of a ball one inch in diameter; the\r\nEarth reduced to the same scale would be a minute speck less than one\r\none-hundredth of an inch in diameter; a perforation in paper made by\r\nthe finest cambric needle would represent the size of this minute\r\nspeck, the Earth. Following this scale we should place this speck nine\r\nfeet from the inch ball, this distance representing 93,000,000 of\r\nmiles, the Earth's distance from the Sun; Mars would be a still smaller\r\nspeck a step farther off. Let us now proceed to Boston Common, for\r\nexample, and on the smooth playground place our inch ball representing\r\nthe Sun; taking three good steps we should place our minute speck,\r\nrepresenting the Earth, upon the ground where it would be immediately\r\nlost in the fine gravel; another step and we would place a still\r\nsmaller particle, representing Mars. How big a circle on the Earth's\r\nsurface, using the inch ball as a centre, should we have to describe in\r\norder to include the nearest fixed star? Such a circle would reach to\r\nDetroit, Michigan, and Columbus, Ohio, or Wilmington, North Carolina!\r\nTo find a circle which would include eight other fixed stars next in\r\ndistance, and only eight of the thousands which render the heavens\r\nso beautiful on a clear winter's night--we should run such a circle\r\nthrough the centre of Hudson Bay, the waters of southern Greenland,\r\nLake Winnipeg, and New Orleans!\r\n\r\nIn this broad way only can we form a dim conception of the overwhelming\r\ndistances of space, and, in this absolutely unthinkable space, our\r\nlittle Sun, with its constant rain of meteoric dust, an occasional\r\ncomet, and its microscopic planets are literally bunched together. To\r\nadmit, as we must then, that one of these motes has had irrigating\r\ncanals on various parts of its surface since prehistoric times, and the\r\nother mote has nothing of the sort despite the geodetic lines that are\r\nseen marking its surface, is simply preposterous. Their disposition,\r\ntheir visibility coincident with the Martian summer, becoming apparent\r\nonly when the snow caps melt, their convergence towards centres of\r\ndistribution, all go to prove by the simplest analogy an identity of\r\nstructure. Certainly the overwhelming force of Lowell's observations\r\nand arguments baffles any other reasonable explanation of the character\r\nand purpose of these markings. Here are the lines, some following the\r\narcs of great circles, all appearing precisely when they should appear,\r\nand in progressive strength from the north when the vivifying water\r\nfrom the melting snow cap first starts the vegetation. Why certain\r\nparallels or doublings are observed in some of the canals is about as\r\npuzzling to us as the checkerboard townships of the West would appear\r\nto a Martian, where some would be yellow with the ripening grain while\r\nothers, uncultivated, would appear of a different color.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nOTHER WORLDS INHABITED\r\n\r\n        _Whether the other fixed stars have similar planetary\r\n        companions or not is to us a matter of pure conjecture,\r\n        which may or may not enter into our conception of the\r\n        universe. But probably every thoughtful person believes\r\n        with regard to those distant suns that there is in space\r\n        something besides our system on which they shine._\r\n\r\n                TYNDALL.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would be a waste of time to attempt an interpretation of the\r\nmarkings of Mars as a result of intelligent effort, if it could be\r\nproved beyond a reasonable doubt that our globe was not only unique\r\namong the bodies which probably accompany the innumerable suns, but was\r\nthe only body, among them all, sustaining creatures of intelligence. If\r\nlife exists in other planets of a nature with which we are familiar,\r\nthen the physical conditions must be similar to those of our own\r\nplanet. Later we shall point out the infinite variety of conditions\r\nunder which life--even man--exists on this globe, and it will be\r\nshown that the question of higher or lower temperature, more or less\r\nhumidity, higher or lower atmospheric pressure, greater or less force\r\nof gravity, can have but little weight in discussing the probability of\r\nlife in other worlds.\r\n\r\nIn a planet devoid of atmosphere, or a sphere glowing with its own\r\nheat, we may decide without question that life does not exist. Even\r\nin a globe in many respects like our own it would be hazardous to\r\nconjecture the kinds of organic forms in which it is manifested.\r\nReasoning from analogy, if life exists in Mars, or other spheres in\r\ninfinite space, it must have originated under much the same conditions\r\nas it originated here; at the outset the most primitive bits of\r\nprotoplasm. But has life appeared in Mars? Tyndall, in graphic words,\r\npictures the rounding of worlds from nebulous haze, and then says,\r\n\"For eons, the immensity of which overwhelms man's conception, the\r\nEarth was unfit to maintain what we call life. It is now covered\r\nwith visible living things. They are not formed of matter different\r\nfrom that around them. They are, on the contrary, bone of its bone\r\nand flesh of its flesh.\" Mars must come in the same category. It is\r\na part of the original nidus from which our world was condensed, and\r\nhowever life originated in the past, the conditions for its origin,\r\nat least, must have been as favorable on the surface of Mars, as on\r\nthe surface of the Earth, and, so far as we know to the contrary, even\r\nmore favorable. In the beginning, Mars cooled and hardened with all\r\nthose behaviors of contraction, condensation of vapor on its surface,\r\nerosion, etc., and it is impossible to avoid the conviction that life,\r\nas on our Earth, arose under the same physical conditions. Recalling\r\nthe resemblance which Mars bears to the Earth, and the data which have\r\nalready been established, we behold a world in many respects like ours,\r\nwith its sunsets and sunrises, winds that sweep over its surface, the\r\ndust storms from the deserts, its snow-storms and snow-drifts, its\r\ndazzling fields of white in the north, with an occasional snow-storm\r\nthat whitens the planet far down in latitude; the seasonal changes,\r\nand, most important of all, the melting ice caps, with rivulets and\r\ntorrents, temporary arctic seas and frozen pools, its great expanses\r\nof vegetation and sterile plains. We have in Mars the variety of\r\nconditions under which life has assumed its infinite variety of aspects\r\non the Earth, and which, by analogy, should have passed through similar\r\nstages in Mars. Life at the outset must have been protoplasmic; then\r\ncame contractile tissue, muscular bundles, hardened structures within\r\nand without for their support, nerves to animate the muscles, and\r\nprotection for nerve-trunk, either rigid or flexible. Hard parts might\r\nvary under a different force of gravity, though there might appear\r\ntypes of structure that could be classified with our own.\r\n\r\nAll such conditions, however, are mere surmises, for about such matters\r\nwe can reason only from analogy. The first proposition to establish is\r\nthat the conception of the plurality of worlds is not unreasonable, and\r\nsecond, that many of the most eminent astronomers have believed in the\r\ninhabitability of other worlds, and this justifies a reasonable man to\r\nfollow the inquiry. The belief is based upon legitimate analogies which\r\nhave thus far guided man in every generalization, in the establishment\r\nof principles, and are continually appealed to in the details of every\r\nday's experience.\r\n\r\nFrom remote times it has been taken for granted by the best minds\r\nthat other worlds besides ours sustain life. The early belief in the\r\nplurality of worlds was based on the idea that since spheres like ours\r\nhad been fashioned by the Almighty they must have been made for the\r\nsame purpose for which our globe seemed intended, to sustain life, and\r\nScripture was freely quoted in support of the idea.\r\n\r\nSir David Brewster, in his book \"More Worlds Than One,\" says that the\r\ndoctrine of the plurality of worlds was maintained by almost all the\r\ndistinguished astronomers and writers who have flourished since the\r\ntrue figure of the Earth was determined: \"Giordano Bruno of Nola,\r\nKepler, and Tycho believed in it; and Cardinal Cusa and Bruno, before\r\nthe discovery of binary systems among the stars, believed also that\r\nthe stars were inhabited. Sir Isaac Newton likewise adopted it, and\r\nDr. Bentley, Master of Trinity College, in his eighth sermon on the\r\nConfutation of Atheism from the origin and frame of the world, has ably\r\nmaintained the same doctrine. In our own day we may number among its\r\nsupporters the distinguished names of Laplace, Sir William and Sir John\r\nHerschel, Dr. Chalmers, Isaac Taylor, and M. Arago.\"\r\n\r\nThe attitude of the intelligent world to-day is well shown in a recent\r\nnumber of London \"Nature,\" where in a review of a book by Wallace,\r\nendeavoring to show that this world alone sustains life, the reviewer\r\nends by saying: \"To consider this Earth as the only inhabited body in\r\nthe stellar universe, a reversion to prehistoric ideas, may or may not\r\nbe an advance, but it will require very strong arguments before we can\r\nbe brought to consider that its isolation in the Cosmos is indeed a\r\nfact.\" Until the discovery by Schiaparelli of the network of lines in\r\nMars, laid out with seemingly intelligent precision, the arguments for\r\nthe inhabitability of other worlds were based entirely upon analogy.\r\nSir Richard Owen, the great comparative anatomist, in supporting the\r\ncontention that life existed in other planets, said: \"The grounds of\r\nbelief vary with the probability of a proposition; if nothing better\r\nthan analogy can be had--on analogy will belief be based.\"\r\n\r\nProfessor O. M. Mitchell, the first director of the Cincinnati\r\nObservatory, in his work on \"Popular Astronomy,\" says, in regard to the\r\ndoctrine of the plurality of worlds: \"It would be most incredible to\r\nassert, as some have done, that our planet, so small and insignificant\r\nin its proportions when compared with other planets with which it is\r\nallied, is the only world in the whole universe filled with sentient,\r\nrational and intelligent beings capable of comprehending the grand\r\nmysteries of the physical universe.\"\r\n\r\nThe eminent French astronomer, M. Flammarion, has, in an eloquent\r\npassage in his \"Plurality of Worlds,\" portrayed the vastness of the\r\nuniverse and the utter insignificance of our Earth in the immensity of\r\nspace: \"If advancing with the velocity of light[1] we could traverse\r\nfrom century to century this unlimited number of suns and spheres\r\nwithout ever meeting any limit to this prodigious immensity where God\r\nbrings forth worlds and beings; looking behind, but no longer knowing\r\nin what part of the infinite to find this grain of dust called the\r\nEarth, we should stop fascinated and confounded by such a spectacle,\r\nand uniting our voice to the concert of universal nature we should say\r\nfrom the depths of our soul, Almighty God! how senseless we were to\r\nbelieve that there was nothing beyond the Earth, and that our abode\r\nalone possessed the privilege of reflecting thy greatness and honor.\"\r\n\r\nCompare these elevating thoughts with the shrunken attitude of one who\r\nhas the conceit to imagine that he and his kind are not only alone\r\nin the universe but superadds to this monstrous conception the idea\r\nthat the millions of great suns are designedly waltzing around solely\r\nfor his edification and amusement, unmindful of the heedless way in\r\nwhich the millions of his race regard the overpowering majesty of the\r\nheavens. To the thousand millions that live to-day, and the thousand,\r\nthousand millions that have perished in the past, the starry heavens\r\nhave never excited an emotion grateful, reverent, or curious, unless\r\na flaming comet, or an eclipse of the Sun or Moon occurred, and then\r\nwith superstitious fear have they gone grovelling in the dust.\r\n\r\nAn astronomer imbued with Hebraic conceptions of the universe is\r\npoorly equipped to appreciate the arguments in favor of life in other\r\nworlds. He may be keen in perceiving lines in the spectrum, and the\r\nsignificance of their lateral displacement, but possessed with a\r\nbelief--the result of early training--that a little two-legged human\r\nmolecule could command the Sun and Moon to stand still, a realization\r\nof his own insignificance, or the possibility of intelligence in other\r\nworlds, must forever remain beyond his grasp. Emerson said \"the dogmas\r\nshrivel as dry leaves at the door of the observatory.\" They never\r\nshrivel for such minds, but grow and flourish with a density that\r\nobscures by, its rankness every rational conception of the heavens\r\nabove. As an illustration of the attitude of such mentalities we have\r\nto go back fifty years, for few survive to-day. Edward Hitchcock,\r\nProfessor of Geology and Theology at Amherst, wrote a book just fifty\r\nyears ago entitled \"Plurality of Worlds,\" in which he denounces the\r\nidea; but observe the precise way in which he lays down the law: \"The\r\nplanets had no vital tendencies, they could have had such given only by\r\nan additional act or series of acts of creative power. As mere inert\r\nglobes, they had no settled destiny to be the seats of life; they could\r\nhave had such a destiny only by the appointment of Him who creates\r\nliving things and puts them in the places which he chooses for them\"\r\n(page 352).\r\n\r\nIt may be objected that it is useless to bring up these old theological\r\nconceptions, as the world has happily gone beyond them, and only in an\r\natavistic manner do we find a few still holding them; nevertheless it\r\nmay be safely asserted that fifty years hence we shall look back upon\r\nthe attitude of certain astronomers to-day with much the same pity and\r\namusement which excites us when we regard the attitude of a similar\r\nclass in the middle of the last century.\r\n\r\nTyndall expresses the universal belief of thinkers in whatever line\r\nof work, that life is by no means confined to this Earth. He says:\r\n\"Whether the other fixed stars have similar planetary companions or\r\nnot is to us a matter of pure conjecture, which may or may not enter\r\ninto our conception of the universe. But probably every thoughtful man\r\nbelieves, with regard to these distant Suns, that there is, in space,\r\nsomething besides our system on which they shine.\"\r\n\r\nOne class of objectors to the idea that other worlds are inhabited\r\nendeavors to show that our position in the universe is unique, that the\r\nsolar system itself is quite unlike anything existing elsewhere, and,\r\nto cap the climax, that our own little world has just the right amount\r\nof water, air, and gravitational force to enable it to be the abode of\r\nintelligent life, and nowhere else in the broad expanse of heaven can\r\nsuch physical habitudes be found as will enable life to originate or to\r\nexist!\r\n\r\nIn a memoir on the \"Evolution of the Solar System,\" by Professor T.\r\nJ. J. See, the author, while not denying the possibility of other\r\nsystems like our own, still considers our system unique. Here are his\r\nwords: \"Therefore, while observation gives us no grounds for denying\r\nthe existence of other systems like our own, it does not enable us\r\nto affirm, or even to render probable, that such systems do exist.\"\r\nBecause a number of binary stars have been discovered in which the two\r\nstars are nearly equal in mass, and their orbits highly eccentric, he\r\ntherefore concludes that the millions of stars that stud the heavens\r\nare probably without satellites. The unreasonableness of this attitude\r\nis emphasized by realizing that these innumerable suns are similar\r\nto our own Sun, as revealed by the spectroscope, and have a similar\r\neruptive energy. Professor Newcomb, however, says: \"Evidence is\r\ncontinually increasing that dark and opaque worlds like ours exist and\r\nrevolve around their primaries.\" Had Mr. See discovered that every\r\nstar of the many million was accompanied by another star nearly equal\r\nin mass, with its marked eccentric behavior, then only would he be\r\njustified in his inference that our solar system was indeed unique.\r\nWhen one realizes that the stars are at such unimaginable distances\r\nthat the highest powers of the telescope reveal even the nearest of\r\nthem only as points of light--not as disks--and when one further\r\nrealizes that the satellites of our Sun, even the largest of them,\r\nare diminutive globes compared to the vastness of the Sun, it seems\r\nunreasonable if not impossible to entertain the idea that none of these\r\nremote stars are accompanied by satellites, and that, therefore, this\r\nlittle Sun of ours stands without parallel in the universe.\r\n\r\nTyndall, in his famous reply to the critics of his Belfast address,\r\nin speaking of the origin of life, referred to the Nebular Theory\r\nas follows: \"According to it our sun and planets were once diffused\r\nthrough space as an impalpable haze out of which by condensation\r\ncame the solar system. What caused it to condense? Loss of heat.\r\nWhat rounded the sun and planets? That which rounds a tear,\r\nmolecular force.\" In these terse and graphic expressions we are made\r\nto understand the universality of law. So far as we have sounded\r\nthe depths of the stellar universe we see the same obedience to\r\ngravitational laws, the same flashing lines in the spectrum. We\r\nencounter no phenomena that cannot be explained, or at least inferred,\r\nby the knowledge we have obtained from our little mote of the Cosmos.\r\n\r\nMr. See thinks it remarkable that \"previous investigators have almost\r\ninvariably approached the problem of cosmogony from the point of\r\nview of the planets and satellites, and that no considerable attempt\r\nhas been made to inquire into the development of the great number of\r\nsystems observed among the fixed stars.\" It is true our planetary\r\nsystem has been used as a standard of measurement for the universe,\r\nand a very comprehensive standard it has proved to be. The law of\r\nuniversal gravitation was based on terrestrial and lunar observations,\r\nspectroscopic analysis was determined in a terrestrial laboratory. As\r\nGeorge Iles says, a coal of fire may be raked from a grate and broken\r\nup to illustrate the rapid cooling of smaller masses. Even a child's\r\nspinning top may be used in an astronomical lecture. The study of our\r\nSun led to the study of the fixed stars, and so our little system\r\nhas thus far furnished us with examples and illustrations by which we\r\ninterpret the universe.\r\n\r\nIn our solar system we have a fair sample of the Cosmos in miniature,\r\nthough our Sun is so modest in size, compared with the great orbs that\r\nappeal to us by their number and brilliancy. So far as our telescopes\r\nhave sounded the heavens we find nebulous clouds in their structure\r\nshowing inchoate masses, orbital and spiral arrangements, condensations\r\nin their centres. We have the binaries with their extraordinary\r\nproperties, we have variables with their dark bodies revolving around\r\ntheir primaries. In our little system we also have dark bodies\r\nrevolving around a luminous primary, from one of which we endeavor\r\nto interpret the mysteries of the universe; we have loose masses,\r\nas in comets with enormously elongated orbits; we have spheres of\r\ninsignificant size, with small bodies revolving around them, and these\r\nepitomes revolving around a central sun; we have one of these bodies\r\nwith meteoric rings; and, in the case of our own globe, a satellite of\r\nsuch size that except in the form of its orbit it might well represent\r\na binary in embryo;--and, finally, a host of bodies big enough to\r\nreflect the rays of the sun, pursuing their various orbital paths.\r\nWe are told that the stars are as distant from each other as we are\r\nfrom them. We may regard these systems of nebulæ, variables, doubles,\r\netc., as different kinds or species of heavenly bodies; and to assert\r\nthat our system is the only individual of the species in the universe\r\nseems contrary to all celestial analogy, for do we not have hundreds of\r\nbinaries, thousands of variables, millions of suns, revealing the same\r\nfiery energy and consuming the same elemental fuel?\r\n\r\nProfessor Newcomb in his \"Reminiscences\" describes his first sweeping\r\nthe heavens, at random, with the then new twenty-six inch refractor\r\nat the Naval Observatory and discovering a little cluster of stars so\r\nsmall and faint that the individual stars eluded even the great power\r\nof this instrument. He says: \"I could not help the vain longing which\r\none must sometimes feel under such circumstances, to know what beings\r\nmight live on planets belonging to what, from an earthly point of view,\r\nseemed to be on the border of creation itself.\" One would suppose that\r\nthis expression of a longing to ascertain the character of the beings\r\ninhabiting planets circling these distant suns would induce one to\r\nstudy a planet analogous to our Earth, and so near in comparison to\r\nthese unimaginable distances as to be within a hand's grasp, so to\r\nspeak. The little interest Professor Newcomb has taken in the subject\r\nis well expressed in his late book \"Astronomy for Everybody.\" In his\r\nchapter on Mars, in which _Everybody_ is certainly interested, he says:\r\n\"The reader will excuse me for saying anything in this chapter about\r\nthe possible inhabitants of Mars. He knows just as much of the subject\r\nas I do, and that is nothing at all.\" He might at least have given the\r\nvarious pronouncements of Schiaparelli, Lowell, and others as to the\r\nprobable character of these remarkable markings on Mars, and their\r\nsupposed significance.\r\n\r\nWhile Professor Newcomb's attitude on the question of the plurality\r\nof worlds has been somewhat conservative in the past he has lately,\r\nhowever, expressed himself on the question in no uncertain terms. In a\r\nrecent article in \"Harper's Magazine,\" entitled \"Probability of Life\r\nin Other Worlds,\" he has lent his sanction to the rational idea that\r\nother worlds may be the abode of intelligent creatures. His recognition\r\nof the principle will do much to offset the influence if it ever had\r\nany, of a recent book published in England by Alfred Russel Wallace,\r\nin which the distinguished author attempts to show that this world\r\nstands alone as the abode of intelligent life. Despite his epoch-making\r\nwork with Darwin, nearly fifty years ago, which must forever merit our\r\ngratitude, and the charm of his various essays on protective coloring,\r\nmimicry, theory of birds' nests, etc., he has since those lucid days\r\nexpressed convictions of such a nature that if a future DeMorgan\r\nshould write on human paradoxes he would classify Mr. Wallace as chief\r\namong them. A profound believer in evolution, he exempts man from the\r\ninexorable logic of the principle with about as much reason as if,\r\nconfessing his belief in the nebular hypothesis, he should insist that\r\nthe Earth was an exception.\r\n\r\nBut to return to Professor Newcomb's recent utterances. In the\r\nabove-mentioned article he says: \"Not only does life, but intelligence,\r\nflourish on this globe under great variety of conditions as regards\r\ntemperature and surroundings, and no sound reason can be shown\r\nwhy, under certain conditions which are frequent in the universe,\r\nintelligent beings should not acquire the highest development.\" Again\r\nhe says: \"Life, not wholly unlike that on the Earth, may therefore\r\nexist upon Mars, for anything we know to the contrary. More than this\r\nwe cannot say.\" In his final summing up Professor Newcomb says: \"It is\r\ntherefore perfectly reasonable to suppose that beings not only animated\r\nbut endowed with reason inhabit countless worlds in space.\"\r\n\r\nIt would seem as if a mind capable of entertaining an idea of our\r\nuniqueness in the universe betrays the survival of a mental condition\r\nwhich, centuries ago, regarded the stars as bits of luminous material\r\nexpressly designed to illuminate this little earth, around which they\r\nall pursued their daily paths.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nLOWELL'S BOOK ON MARS\r\n\r\n        _This whole arrangement presents an indescribable\r\n        simplicity and symmetry which cannot be the work of chance._\r\n\r\n                SCHIAPARELLI, in writing of the canals.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a discussion of the surface markings of Mars a broad sketch of\r\nwhat has already been accomplished in the study of that planet\r\nshould be given for the general reader. I know of no better way of\r\ndoing this than by giving a brief abstract of Percival Lowell's\r\nepoch-making work entitled \"Mars.\" In this book he presents in a clear\r\nand striking manner the results of his own work covering continuous\r\nobservations of the planet for many years. The preface is dated from\r\nFlagstaff, Arizona, 1895. Since that time he has issued three volumes\r\nof Memoirs, in quarto, of the Lowell Observatory, and a number of\r\nBulletins in which he presents many additional facts confirming\r\nprevious observations, besides new observations; and finally, in a late\r\nBulletin, he has presented photographs of Mars made by his assistant,\r\nMr. Lampland, in which a number of canals plainly show, thus setting\r\nforever at rest the question of the subjective character of the\r\nmarkings. The student must, however, follow the advice of an English\r\nreviewer and by all means read the book.\r\n\r\n\"To determine,\" says Mr. Lowell, \"whether a planet be the abode of\r\nlife in the least resembling that with which we are acquainted, two\r\nquestions about it must be answered in turn: first, are its physical\r\nconditions such as render it, in our general sense, habitable; and\r\nsecondly, are there any signs of its actual habitation? These problems\r\nmust be attacked in their order, for unless we can answer the first\r\nsatisfactorily, it were largely futile to seek for evidence of the\r\nsecond.\" The reason why Mars in certain years becomes so conspicuous\r\nis that its orbit is highly eccentric. Every two years--the period of\r\nits revolution about the Sun--brings it nearest to the Sun, and once in\r\nfifteen years we find ourselves between it and the Sun at its nearest\r\napproach.\r\n\r\nHuyghens, in 1659, made a drawing of the dark region on Mars now known\r\nas the Syrtis Major, and, through its disappearance and reappearance,\r\nhe discovered that the planet rotated on its axis, and roughly\r\ndetermined a daily period of twenty-four hours. For the first time it\r\nwas known that Mars had a day and a night. As some doubts existed as to\r\nthe correctness of Huyghens's figures, Cassini in 1666 determined anew\r\nthe rotation period of Mars and found it to be twenty-four hours and\r\nforty minutes. From the white polar caps, the study of which we first\r\nowe to Maraldi, it was found that the tilt of its axis to the plane\r\nof its orbit was very nearly the same as that of the Earth. As this\r\ninclination determines the seasons, it was seen that Mars, like the\r\nEarth, had its spring, summer, autumn, and winter. A polar flattening\r\nwas also observed which was slightly in excess of ours.\r\n\r\n\"To all forms of life of which we have any conception, two things in\r\nNature are vital, air and water.\" Has it an atmosphere? Without air\r\nno change could take place. The Moon without air remains unchanged,\r\nexcept what gravitation accomplishes in pulling down crater walls.\r\n\"With Mars it is otherwise. Over the surface of that planet changes do\r\noccur, changes upon a scale vast enough to be visible from the Earth.\"\r\nThe first sign of change occurs in the polar snow cap. It dwindles in\r\nsize every two years (the time of a single revolution of Mars around\r\nthe sun). For nearly two hundred years these white polar caps have\r\nbeen observed to wax and wane. As the Martian winter comes on in the\r\nnorthern hemisphere, for example, the polar cap extends its borders to\r\nthe temperate zone. As summer comes on the snow cap is seen to dwindle\r\ngradually away, till by early autumn it presents but a tiny patch a\r\nfew hundred miles across. Schiaparelli observed changes in tint which\r\nhe noticed were correlated with the seasons. In 1894 observations\r\nwere made continuously from early June till late in November. These\r\ndates, in Mars, represent the last of April till the last of August.\r\nDuring this time marked changes took place in the bluish-green areas\r\nof the planet. A wave of seasonal change swept down from the pole to\r\nthe equator. The fact of this occurrence constitutes positive proof of\r\nthe presence of an atmosphere. In another way the evidence was shown.\r\nA series of measurements of the polar and equatorial diameters of\r\nMars were made, and these indicated that a visible layer of twilight\r\natmosphere had been measured. This, Lowell explains by a diagram and\r\nother data. It is found, according to Lowell's observations, that the\r\natmosphere is much freer from clouds than had been supposed. He shows\r\nconclusively that it is much rarer than that of the Earth. Appearances\r\nhave been seen, however, which are best explained by assuming them to\r\nbe clouds.\r\n\r\nDuring the opposition of 1892, Mr. Douglass, at that time an assistant\r\nastronomer at the Lowell Observatory, made a special study of the\r\nterminator of Mars.[2] A careful study of the terminator for almost\r\nevery degree of latitude was made, and 733 irregularities were\r\ndetected. Of this large number, 694 were not only recorded, but\r\nmeasured; and of these, 403 were depressions, and 291 were elevations\r\nof the surface. Many of these irregularities were supposed to be\r\nclouds, but the arguments to support this attribution are too technical\r\nto be presented here. Unmistakable clouds have also been seen moving at\r\na definite rate of speed, as if carried along by the wind.\r\n\r\n\"To sum up, now, what we know about the atmosphere of Mars: we have\r\nproof positive that Mars has an atmosphere; we have reason to believe\r\nthis atmosphere to be very thin,--thinner at least by half than the air\r\nupon the summit of the Himalayas,--and in constitution, not to differ\r\ngreatly from our own.\"\r\n\r\nAs to the existence of water on the planet, one has only to consider\r\nthe polar snow caps. In the height of the southern winter, the\r\npolar cap of snow measures over two thousand miles across, covering\r\nfifty-five degrees of latitude, with one unbroken waste of white. As\r\nspring advances the snow begins to melt, disappearing rapidly as summer\r\ncomes on, and, as it melts, a dark band is seen bordering this edge. As\r\nthe snow recedes the dark band recedes. This band is, therefore, not a\r\npermanent marking on the planet, but obviously water, the result of the\r\nmelting snow--an arctic sea, in fact. This band is irregular, varying\r\nin width in different longitudes, as if the water filled up large areas\r\nof depression. When finally the snow cap disappears, as it did for the\r\nfirst time on record on the notable occasion of October 13, 1894, the\r\ndark band, which had become thinner, disappeared also, leaving only a\r\nyellow stretch of surface. An additional proof that this dark band is\r\nwater, was established by Professor W. H. Pickering, for he discovered\r\nthat the light reflected from its surface was polarized. The absurdity\r\nof the suggestion that these white polar caps are not snow, but\r\ncongealed carbonic acid gas, is fully shown by Lowell.\r\n\r\nThe asymmetry of the outline of these snow caps is paralleled by the\r\nirregularity of the Earth's polar caps. Glints of brilliant light\r\nare seen to flash out from this region, as if produced by sunlight\r\nreflected from a sloping surface. On comparing these flashes of light\r\nwith observations made by Green, in 1877, they were found to be in\r\nthe same place. Detached fields of snow were also observed below\r\nthe receding line, an evidence that these regions were at a higher\r\nelevation. As before stated, on October 13, 1894, for the first time in\r\nthe record of polar observations, the southern polar cap disappeared\r\nentirely. In this connection it may be of interest to observe that in\r\nthe United States, in the summer of 1894, the temperature ranged a few\r\ndegrees above the normal. (For this fact I am indebted to Professor\r\nCleveland Abbe, E. S. M.)\r\n\r\nThe large, irregular, dark regions on the planet have been supposed\r\nto be bodies of water, or seas, and have been described and named\r\nas such by astronomers. Lowell shows, however, that there is every\r\nreason to doubt this conclusion. \"To begin with, they are of every\r\ngrade of tint,--a very curious feature for seas to exhibit, unless\r\nthey were everywhere but a few feet deep; which, again, is a most\r\nsingular characteristic for seas that cover hundreds of thousands of\r\nsquare miles in extent,--seas, that is, as large as the Bay of Bengal.\r\nThe Martian surface would have to be amazingly flat for this to be\r\npossible. We know it to be relatively flat, but to be as flat as all\r\nthis would seem to pass the bounds of credible simplicity. Here, also,\r\nProfessor W. H. Pickering's polariscope investigations come in with\r\neffect, for he found the light from the supposed seas to show no trace\r\nof polarization. Hence, these were probably not water.\"\r\n\r\nLowell also shows that if these regions were seas, or water surfaces\r\nof the shallowest kind, sunlight would certainly be reflected from\r\nsome portion of the surface so as to be visible from the Earth. A\r\ncalculation of the region from which such a beam of light might be\r\nreflected has been carefully made, but no light of this nature has ever\r\nbeen seen. These regions change in color, and Schiaparelli suggested\r\nthat in some way these changes were dependent on the Martian seasons.\r\nLowell, by continuous observations covering many presentations of the\r\nplanet, has demonstrated that the changes in color are synchronous\r\nwith the seasons, and they further show that these regions change in\r\nexpanse as well. The reader must refer to Lowell's book to understand\r\nthe very minute way in which the author traces out the behavior of\r\nthese so-called seas as the Martian summer advances and autumn comes\r\non. His evidence is overwhelming that the regions heretofore regarded\r\nas seas are vast tracts of vegetation, doubtless on lower levels, or\r\ndepressions of the surface, old sea bottoms, in fact, where springs\r\nand the natural settlings of stray waters might keep the ground\r\nsufficiently moist to support a scanty growth. The regions not marked\r\nby the dark shading, from their reddish and yellowish tinge, have\r\nalways been regarded as land, probably desert land, as they remain\r\nfixed from year to year, dead and unchangeable as deserts are.\r\n\r\nThe question naturally arises, if the water of Mars is piled up at\r\nthe poles as snow, how does it find its way back on its melting?\r\nA discovery made by Schiaparelli in 1877 revealed the existence\r\nof various lines marking the surface which he called _canali_, or\r\nchannels.[3] These lines cover the face of the planet like a net, they\r\nare laid out with geodetic precision. \"The lines start from points on\r\nthe coast of the blue-green regions, commonly well-marked bays, and\r\nproceed directly to what seem centres in the middle of the continent,\r\nsince, most surprisingly, they meet there other lines that have come\r\nto the same spot with apparently a like determinate intent.\" In other\r\nwords these lines--fine, straight, dark, as if cut by an engraver, some\r\nof them running for hundreds of miles--converge at certain centres.\r\nThey all start, as Schiaparelli first observed, from definite regions\r\nand terminate at definite points. Many of them follow the arcs of great\r\ncircles. These lines may be thirty or more miles in width, apparently\r\npreserving the same width throughout, though slightly wider where they\r\nleave the dark bands. They run in every direction, a number often\r\nconverging at a common centre, and, when they do so, a round, dark area\r\nappears which Lowell has called an oasis.\r\n\r\nIn the clear and steady atmosphere of Flagstaff, Mr. Lowell, by the\r\naid of his superb telescope, has added about four times as many canals\r\nas are shown on Schiaparelli's chart. These canals form an intricate\r\nnetwork of lines, and no one can contemplate these curious features\r\nwithout being impressed by their artificial character. Schiaparelli,\r\nwho first discovered them in 1877, continued his observations from\r\nyear to year despite the fact that no one else could see them. In the\r\ncourse of a few years he discovered a still more remarkable condition,\r\nand this was that a number of the canals appeared double. This, indeed,\r\nseemed an optical illusion, and by no means strengthened his position,\r\nas the single canals proclaimed by him were supposed to be figments of\r\nthe imagination. Undeterred by the general scepticism, Schiaparelli\r\nestablished, at each fresh opposition, his previous announcements. For\r\nnine years no one was able to confirm his marvellous discoveries. In\r\nthe year 1886, however, Perrotin, at Nice, with his assistant, Thollon,\r\nmanaged to make out a number of the canals, single and double, which\r\nwere carefully drawn. Reference to Perrotin's work will be made further\r\non. The reason why so few have seen them is the lack of observers\r\nwith acute eyesight and patient devotion to the work, coupled with\r\nunsteady air. Size of aperture seems to be of little importance. That\r\nSchiaparelli, with an 8-1/3 inch glass, discovered the canals, while\r\nwith the twenty-six inch glass of the Naval Observatory at Washington\r\nthey have never been seen, is emphatic evidence of what a clear and\r\nsteady atmosphere means in the study of delicate planetary markings.\r\n\r\nThe artificiality of the canals is shown by the \"supernaturally regular\r\nappearance of the system, upon three distinct counts: first, the\r\nstraightness of the lines; second, their individually uniform width;\r\nand, third, their systematic radiation from special points.\" It was\r\nthe mathematical shape of the Ohio mounds that first suggested their\r\nartificial character. That these lines are artificial and not natural\r\nis seen in the fact that at times they are not visible. The lines while\r\ntemporary in appearance are permanently in place. \"Not only do they not\r\nchange in position during one opposition; they seem not to do so from\r\none opposition to another.\" \"Unchangeable, apparently, in position, the\r\ncanals are otherwise among the most changeable features of the Martian\r\ndisk.\" The order of their appearance synchronizes with the changes of\r\nthe season, as the snow caps begin to melt the canals begin to appear;\r\nin appearance strengthened first at the borders of the polar seas\r\nand gradually stretching down towards the equator. In minute detail\r\nLowell presents the successive visibility of the different canals. To\r\naccount for all these phenomena we have to look at our own Earth for a\r\nparallel, and we see it in the great irrigation tracks of the West, and\r\nin the vast irrigated regions in India depending upon the melting of\r\nthe Himalaya snow cap.\r\n\r\nThe accumulative evidence is overwhelming that here is a dry planet,\r\nand an intelligence of some kind that can only survive by utilizing the\r\nfew remaining sources of water supply. It is to the merit of Professor\r\nW. H. Pickering, to whom Professor Lowell gives the credit of having\r\nfirst suggested the idea of irrigation to account for the great width\r\nof the canals. What we see, then, is not the canal, which may be a\r\nslender stream of water, but a broad band of vegetation irrigated from\r\nthese narrow channels. These lines penetrate and cross the dark regions\r\nin various directions, which again offer additional proof that the\r\nso-called seas are not seas but areas of vegetation sparsely scattered,\r\nagainst which the irrigated portions are of sufficient strength and\r\ncolor to show.[4]\r\n\r\nAmong the most interesting features of the planet's surface are the\r\nround, or oval spots which Lowell calls oases; these invariably occur\r\nat the junction of the canals. \"In spite of the great number of the\r\nspots, not one of them stands isolate. There is not a single instance\r\nof a spot that is not connected by a canal to the rest of the dark\r\nareas.\" There appears to be no spot that has not two or more canals\r\nrunning to it, and apparently no canal junction is without its spot.\r\nThe majority of the spots are 120 to 150 miles in diameter. There are\r\nmany smaller ones. These spots, like the canals, appear and disappear\r\ncoincidently with seasonal changes. The canals and the oases follow\r\nthe same method and order in their growth. \"Both are affected by one\r\nprogressive change that sweeps over the face of the planet from the\r\npole to the equator.\" The reader cannot dwell too strongly on the fact\r\nthat the visibility of these various markings appears first in northern\r\nlatitudes, and gradually darkens toward the equator, precisely the\r\nreverse of the unfolding of plant life on the Earth. From Mars our\r\nEarth would show its tropical vegetation the year round, while in Mars\r\nno tropical vegetable coloration would appear until water from the\r\nmelting polar snow caps animates its growth.\r\n\r\nLowell shows conclusively that the seas are not seas, nor the canals\r\nwaterways, nor the spots lakes. Apparently, the spots appear not so\r\nmuch by an increase in size as by a deepening in tint. They start, it\r\nwould seem, as big as they are to be, but faint in tone; they then\r\nproceed to darken throughout. If these spots are areas of vegetation,\r\nthe explanation of their appearance is at once evident. Even more\r\nmarkedly unnatural is another phenomenon of this phenomenal system,\r\nof which almost every one has heard and almost nobody has seen,--the\r\ndouble canals. Upon a part of the disk where, up to that time, a\r\nsingle canal has been visible, of a sudden, some night, in place of\r\nthe single canal, twin canals are perceived, similar in character and\r\ninclination, absolutely parallel, reminding one of the twin rails of a\r\nrailroad track. The regularity of the thing is startling. In details\r\nthe doubles vary, chiefly, it would seem, in the distance the twin\r\nlines lie apart. Lowell says the widest he has seen is the Ganges,\r\nin which six degrees separate the two lines,--in the narrowest, the\r\nPhison, four degrees and a quarter. From 120 to 175 miles of clear\r\ncountry is found between the paralleling lines. \"One element of mystery\r\nmay be eliminated at the outset.... It is perceived of a sudden, by the\r\nobserver, because of some specially favorable night. But it has been\r\nfor some time developing. So much is apparent from my observations.\r\nSuggestions of duality occurred weeks before the thing stood definitely\r\nrevealed. Furthermore, the gemination may lie concealed from the\r\nobserver some time after it is quite complete, owing to lack of\r\nfavorable atmospheric conditions. For it takes emphatically steady air\r\nto see it unmistakably.\" Each canal has its individual behavior of\r\ndoubling, and the varying widths, and their evident seasonal relations\r\nutterly forbid the conception that their appearance is due to optical\r\nillusion. Mr. Lowell feels tolerably sure that the doubling, or\r\ngemination of the canals, show that the phenomenon is not only seasonal\r\nbut vegetal. Why it should take this form is one of the most pregnant\r\nproblems about the planet. For it is the most artificial-looking\r\nphenomenon of an artificial-looking disk.\r\n\r\nWe quote a paragraph from the concluding chapter in his book: \"To\r\nreview, now, the chain of reasoning by which we have been led to\r\nregard it probable that upon the surface of Mars we see the effects\r\nof local intelligence. We find, in the first place, that the broad\r\nphysical conditions of the planet are not antagonistic to some form\r\nof life; secondly, that there is an apparent dearth of water upon the\r\nplanet's surface, and, therefore, if beings of sufficient intelligence\r\ninhabited it, they would have to resort to irrigation to support life;\r\nthirdly, that there turns out to be a network of markings covering the\r\ndisk, precisely counterparting what a system of irrigation would look\r\nlike; and, lastly, that there is a set of spots placed where we should\r\nexpect to find the lands thus artificially fertilized, and behaving as\r\nsuch constructed oases should. All this, of course, may be a set of\r\ncoincidences, signifying nothing; but the probability points the other\r\nway. As to details of explanation, any we may adopt will undoubtedly be\r\nfound, on closer acquaintance, to vary from the actual Martian state of\r\nthings; for any Martian life must differ markedly from our own.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn this brief résumé of Lowell's work on Mars but scant justice has\r\nbeen done to the many novel and convincing suggestions in explanation\r\nof the varied features marking the surface of Mars. There are many\r\nenigmas, however, awaiting solution, if we endeavor to explain them\r\nby comparison with the methods pursued by man on this Earth, and Mr.\r\nLowell frankly admits the many difficulties in the way of a clear\r\nsolution. I have already mentioned how puzzling the checker-board\r\nappearance of our Western townships would seem to a Martian, but this\r\ncomparison does not help us to understand the so-called gemination of\r\nthe canals, though we might have parallel sets of canals, as we have\r\nparallel lines of railways. The enormous distance which the water\r\ntravels in the Martian canals must presuppose an artificial method of\r\nurging it on. Precisely how this operation might be accomplished is a\r\nquestion to be solved by the mechanical and hydraulic engineer.\r\n\r\nBeside the doubling, or so-called gemination, of the canals, there are\r\nother enigmas in the markings. At certain times there has been observed\r\nin the equatorial region of Mars a number of white spots, which have\r\ngreatly puzzled the student of Mars and for which no explanation has\r\nyet been offered. That they are not clouds is seen in the fact that\r\nthey do not move or drift. Furthermore these white spots are fixed\r\nfeatures of the region, as they appear in the same places. It might\r\nbe suggested that they represent snow-capped elevations or mountain\r\npeaks, but this is difficult to believe, as an examination of the\r\nterminator of Mars reveals no evidences of high elevations. These white\r\nspots appear only in mid-summer, which would argue against the idea\r\nof their being snow caps, as in mid-summer they would certainly melt\r\nand disappear. The time of their appearance coincides with the time\r\nof greatest equatorial heat. For a reasonable suggestion it might be\r\noffered that these white spots are due to vegetation of some kind.\r\nThe cotton belt of the South, if one could imagine the cotton bolls a\r\nlittle larger and more crowded together, would make white areas. Masses\r\nof white flowers, such as the whiteweed or daisy, may be seen covering\r\nhundreds of acres of meadow land in New England. I have noticed from\r\nthe tops of mountains in New Hampshire, in July, extensive meadow\r\nlands resembling fields of snow from the profusion of white daisies.\r\nThe blossoming of fruit trees in the Santa Clara valley, California,\r\nwhitens the surface for miles. Since the appearance of these white\r\nspots in Mars corresponds with the period of greatest evaporation, it\r\nis conceivable that an intelligence in Mars might utilize the same\r\nmethod which has been recently adopted in Connecticut and Porto Rico\r\nin the raising of tobacco; namely, to protect the fields with white\r\ncotton cloth; or, as in Florida, where extensive orange groves are\r\ncovered with white cloth to guard against sudden frost. That this\r\nsupposition has something to commend it may be seen in the accompanying\r\nreproduction of a photograph (Plate I), made in Porto Rico, of tobacco\r\nplantations when the fields are covered with white cloth supported on\r\nsuitable frames. This picture appeared in an article by Eugene P. Lyle,\r\nJr., on Porto Rico, in the January number of \"World's Work,\" to the\r\npublishers of which we are indebted for the privilege of using it.\r\n\r\nThese various guesses may all be wrong, as, after all, we are judging\r\nMars from conditions belonging to our own planet. This, however, we are\r\ncompelled to do, as we have no other standards of comparison.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE I\r\n\r\nTOBACCO CULTIVATION UNDER CLOTH, PORTO RICO]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF ASTRONOMERS\r\n\r\n        _That there may be types of life of some kind on Mars is, I\r\n        should think, quite likely._\r\n\r\n                SIR ROBERT BALL.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the following chapter are presented abstracts from memoirs,\r\ncommunications, etc., of a few among the many astronomers and observers\r\nwho have recognized the markings on the planet, and, in many cases,\r\nhave made drawings of them. Before presenting these few brief records,\r\nI have compiled, from Camille Flammarion's great work on Mars, the\r\nnames of those astronomers whose drawings he reproduces in this\r\nmonograph, for such it is. A brief examination of Flammarion's volume\r\nwill give one an idea of the extent and variety of work which has\r\nalready been accomplished in interpreting the surface features of\r\nMars, and the number of astronomers who have made contributions to the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nFlammarion divides these observations into three periods; the first,\r\nbeginning with the rude drawing of Fontana, in 1636, followed by\r\nHuyghens, in 1659, Cassini, in 1666, and many others up to Harding,\r\nin 1824. In this period the drawings were rude, though a number of\r\nthe more conspicuous features were established, and above all, the\r\nexistence of what was interpreted as snow in the white polar caps.\r\nAstronomically many points were determined, such as an approximation\r\nof the period of revolution, the distance of Mars from the Sun, the\r\ndiameter of the planet, its mass, the inclination of its axis, the\r\neccentricity of its orbit, its period of rotation, etc.\r\n\r\nThe second period begins with the remarkable work of Beer and Mäedler,\r\nin 1830 and subsequent years. To them belongs the honor of being the\r\nfirst astronomers to make a chart of the planet. An advance standard\r\nwas set for future studies, and the work which followed revealed\r\ndetails in the surface markings never before suspected. The second\r\nperiod, from 1830 to 1877, includes the observations and drawings of\r\nBeer and Mäedler, 1830; Sir John Herschel, 1830; Galle, 1837; Warren\r\nde la Rue, 1856; Webb, 1856; Secchi, 1858; Liais, 1860; Schmidt,\r\n1862; Lockyer, 1862; Phillips, 1862; Lassell, 1862; Knott, 1862;\r\nKaiser, 1862; Dawes, 1864; Franzenne, 1864; Williams, 1867; Proctor,\r\n1867; Lahardeley, 1871; Burton, 1871; Wilson, 1871; Gledhill, 1871;\r\nFlammarion, 1873; Terby, 1873; Green, 1873; Trouvelot, 1873; Lohse,\r\n1873; Holden, 1875.\r\n\r\nThe third period extends from 1877 to 1892, when Flammarion published\r\nhis book. The following drawings are given: Flammarion, 1877-88; Paul\r\nand Prosper Henry, 1877; Neisten, 1877-79-81-88; Terby, 1877-79-88;\r\nVan Ertborn, 1877; Cruls, 1877; Dreyer, 1877-79; Lohse, 1877-79-83-84;\r\nGreen, 1877; Schiaparelli, 1877-79; Maunder, 1879; Konkoly, 1879;\r\nBoeddicker, 1881-84; Burton, 1882; Trouvelot, 1884; Knoble, 1884;\r\nDenning, 1886; Perrotin and Thollon, 1886; Proctor, 1888; Perrotin,\r\n1888; Holden and Keeler, 1888; Wislicenus, 1888-90; W. H. Pickering,\r\n1890; Williams, 1890; Giovannozzi, 1890; Guillaume, 1890.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to follow these various drawings of Mars from the\r\nearliest ones of the first period, many of little value, to the slow\r\nyet certain advance as seen in the more detailed drawings of the second\r\nperiod, without realizing the gradual improvement of the telescope,\r\ncoupled with a greater number of observers endowed with better eyesight\r\nand impelled by deeper interest in the work. In the third period,\r\nculminating with the great work of Schiaparelli, and confirmed by the\r\nremarkable observations of Perrotin and Thollon, we see the results of\r\nstill more arduous devotion to the work; a great advance in telescopes,\r\nwith better definition, and, in the case of the observations at Nice\r\nand Milan, a steadier atmosphere through which to observe. Flammarion\r\nbrought his work up to 1892.\r\n\r\nLowell's work on Mars, though of a kind with Schiaparelli, is, in every\r\ncircumstance accompanying it, so remarkable that we may well consider\r\nthe standard now set by him as the beginning of another period;\r\nand this period will fix a standard which will consist in securing\r\nobservers who, in the language of Sir David Gill, have a special\r\nfaculty, an inborn capacity, a delight in the exercise of exceptional\r\nacuteness of eyesight and natural dexterity, coupled with the gift of\r\nimagination as to the true meaning of what they observe. With this\r\nstandard established, there must also go a perfect telescope for\r\ndefinition, mounted on an elevation a mile and a half or more above the\r\nlevel of the sea, in a region of the clearest and steadiest atmosphere\r\nin the world.\r\n\r\nOne cannot help reflecting on these various drawings presented in\r\nFlammarion's work, and wondering what the results would have been if\r\nall these astronomers could have had telescopes as incomparable as\r\nthat at Flagstaff, perched on some high mountain peak with a clear and\r\nsteady atmosphere continuous for weeks, and, superadded to all these\r\nadvantages, independent fortunes to enable them to transport their\r\ntelescopes thousands of miles south when a favorable opposition of Mars\r\noccurred at a low altitude.\r\n\r\nThe astronomers who have advanced certain theories to explain the\r\nmarkings may be counted as admitting their existence, whatever they may\r\nbe. Among the other astronomers to be referred to are, first, those\r\nwho admit the markings, and have in all likelihood seen them; second,\r\nthose who have observed and made drawings of the markings; and, third,\r\nthose who have drawn them and admit, or at least do not deny, their\r\nartificiality.\r\n\r\nMiss Agnes M. Clerke, an astronomical writer of great merit, who has\r\nwritten a most lucid and comprehensive \"History of Astronomy in the\r\nNineteenth Century,\" says: \"The canals of Mars are an existent and\r\npermanent phenomenon.\" Mr. Thomas Lindsay, of Toronto, read some\r\nnotes before the Astronomical Society of that city in regard to the\r\nphenomenon of the so-called doubling of the canals and the explanation\r\nadvanced that it was due to errors in focusing. \"It had been stated\r\nby several English observers that, by racking the eyepiece within or\r\nwithout the focus, all the phenomena might be produced.\" In the case\r\nof Mars, however, he asks: \"How is it possible that all the observers\r\nhad their telescopes unadjusted, and, if any one had, would he not\r\nbe immediately aware of it?\" Mr. Lindsay thought that the theory was\r\ntoo obviously opposed to the simplest kind of common sense to merit a\r\nmoment's consideration.\r\n\r\nMr. John A. Patterson, in his Presidential address before the\r\nAstronomical Society of Toronto, in speaking of Mars, said the\r\ndiscoveries rest on the bed rock of scientific evidence; and, after\r\nspeaking of the supposed spectroscopic evidence that there was no\r\natmosphere in Mars, refers to the polar snow caps, their melting, and\r\nthe lines of vegetation that are supposed to mark the margin of the\r\ncanals, and he asks: \"Is it possible that all these may be consistent\r\nwith no vapor floating above the surface? Is it sound philosophy to\r\nconclude that the condition of things on our own little world gauges\r\nthe possibilities and relations that exist in our sister world? Dame\r\nNature does not turn out all her products in one pattern.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Denning, in the \"Astronomische Nachrichten,\" No. 3926, gives\r\nthe result of his observations on Mars in 1903. He says the canals,\r\nwithout doubt, are objective features; changes in the appearance of\r\nthese markings he attributes to vaporous condensations. One rotation\r\nperiod of the planet satisfies the observation of all the markings,\r\nthus proving them to be definite features of the planet's surface\r\nrather than drifting vapors such as are seen when observing Jupiter\r\nand Saturn. In spite of these admissions Mr. Denning, in 1905, while\r\nrepeating his convictions as to the objectivity of the canals, denied\r\ntheir sharp outline. Of the ten canals he drew, eight were discovered\r\nby Schiaparelli, and two were discovered by Lowell. Denning observed\r\nthese lines with a ten inch reflector. Schiaparelli compared them in\r\nsharpness to lines of a steel engraving. It rests with the reader\r\nto judge who is most likely to be correct in his description of the\r\ncharacter of the lines--Mr. Denning with a ten inch reflector, in a\r\npoor atmosphere, or Schiaparelli and Lowell, with a twenty-six and a\r\ntwenty-four inch refractor, respectively, in a far superior atmosphere.\r\n\r\nAmong the many who have seen and drawn the canals comes first, of\r\ncourse, Professor Schiaparelli, the discoverer of them. It is only\r\nnecessary to state here that he first detected these enigmatical\r\nmarkings, which he named _canali_, in 1877. In the opposition of 1879,\r\nhe not only confirmed the discoveries of 1877, but added new _canali_,\r\nand for the first time saw the curious process of doubling, or\r\ngemination.\r\n\r\nAstronomers in various parts of the world searched in vain for these\r\nmarkings, and despite the exalted character and remarkable work of the\r\ndistinguished Italian in other lines of astronomic research, it was\r\nfeared that, in this instance, Schiaparelli had been the victim of an\r\nhallucination. It is true that from the time of Huyghens, in 1659, a\r\nfew astronomers, such as Secchi, Schroeter, Kaiser, and Dawes, have\r\ndetected and drawn a few faint lines which seemed to be identical with\r\nthe _canali_ of Schiaparelli. It was not until 1886, however, that\r\nPerrotin and Thollon with a twenty-nine inch refractor of the Nice\r\nObservatory, first began to confirm the discoveries of Schiaparelli,\r\nand since that time observers in various parts of the world have\r\ndetected and drawn these remarkable lines. The cumulative testimony of\r\nthese men as to the veritable existence of these markings cannot be set\r\naside.\r\n\r\nIt seems strange that nine years should elapse before an astronomer\r\nwith an interest in the subject, coupled with an acute vision and the\r\npatience to observe assiduously, should arise to confirm the existence\r\nof these markings, but in another chapter I have called attention to\r\nthe little interest astronomers have manifested in planetary markings\r\nof any kind. It has been shown elsewhere that acute vision, with a\r\nclear and, above all, a steady atmosphere, are the chief essentials\r\nin making out the markings. It is curious to note the attitude of\r\nsome astronomers, who, having seen the canals and even drawn them,\r\ndenied their veritability. Their explanations cover \"illusions due to\r\nthe property of light itself, the inability of the eye to maintain\r\nits mechanism of accommodation, the behavior of air waves, temporary\r\nalteration of the focus of the eye, undetected astigmatism,\" etc.,\r\netc. But, to return to the astronomers who have drawn them. On the\r\nunfavorable opposition of 1888, Schiaparelli declares that \"the\r\n_canali_ had all the distinctness of an engraving on steel, with the\r\nmagical beauty of a colored engraving.\" He furthermore says: \"As far as\r\nwe have been able to observe them hitherto, they are certainly fixed\r\nconfigurations upon the planet, the Nilosyrtis has been seen in that\r\nplace for nearly one hundred years and some of the others for at least\r\nthirty years.\"\r\n\r\nIn this connection it is interesting to quote from Schiaparelli who,\r\nuntil many years after he discovered the canals of Mars, had no doubt\r\nof their natural origin. As late as 1893, he still considered them\r\nnatural. In speaking of the canals, he says: \"It is not necessary\r\nto suppose here the work of intelligent beings; and in spite of the\r\nalmost geometric appearance of their whole system, for the present\r\nwe incline to believe that they are product of the evolution of a\r\nplanet, much as on the Earth is the English Channel, or the Channel\r\nof Mozambique.\" This extract may be found in a memoir in \"Natura ed\r\nArte,\" 1893, page 22. On page 24 of the same memoir Schiaparelli\r\nillustrates the elasticity of his mind and a thoroughly unprejudiced\r\nattitude by saying: \"Their singular aspect, and the fact that they\r\nare drawn with absolute geometric precision, as if they were the\r\nproduct of rule and compass, have induced some people to see in them\r\nthe work of intelligent beings, inhabitants of the planet. _I should\r\nbe very careful not to combat this supposition, which involves no\r\nimpossibility._\" (The italics are ours.) His comparison of the Martian\r\nlines with the English Channel and the Channel of Mozambique, if he\r\nmeans any resemblance in form and not in the manner of formation, is\r\nmost unfortunate, for on the whole face of the Earth he could not\r\nhave mentioned surface features more totally unlike any feature of the\r\nMartian surface, as drawn by him, than these two channels: the English\r\nChannel, 100 miles wide at its mouth and 200 miles long, tapering to\r\nthe Straits of Dover; the Mozambique Channel, hour-glass shaped, 1,100\r\nmiles long, and, at its narrowest part, 260 miles wide, and at either\r\nend nearly 700 miles wide. Had he suggested the Red Sea, 1,200 miles\r\nlong, or the Straits of Malacca, 350 miles long, a nearer resemblance\r\nto the canals of Mars might have been seen, though even here it would\r\nbe impossible to find their counterparts in Mars. These channels are\r\nmerging with the ocean, are nearly half the width of their length, and\r\nenlarge at both ends, while the _canali_ of Mars run for hundreds of\r\nmiles as straight as ruled lines. How slight the resemblance is may be\r\nappreciated by comparing the following figure of the Earth (Fig. 1),\r\nupon which the Red Sea, the English and the Mozambique Channels and the\r\nStraits of Malacca are indicated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.]\r\n\r\nIn 1897 Schiaparelli becomes still more convinced of their\r\nartificiality. In his Memoir XXV, in the Reale Academia del Lincei,\r\nin speaking of the canals, he says: \"This whole arrangement presents\r\nan indescribable simplicity and symmetry which cannot possibly be the\r\nwork of chance.\" In a letter to Mr. Lowell, dated December 4, 1904, he\r\nwrites: \"Your theory of vegetation becomes more and more probable.\" Mr.\r\nA. Stanley Williams, in the \"Observatory\" for June, 1899, in a paper\r\nentitled \"Notes on Mars,\" described the appearance of certain canals,\r\nregions, etc., in great detail. He notices that at the crossing of the\r\ncanals a little dark spot occurs, a feature, he says, which was first\r\nelucidated by Professor Lowell in 1894. Mr. Williams also noticed the\r\nblack streak bordering the northern snow cap, which Mr. Lowell in his\r\nbook on Mars has interpreted as a body of water resulting from the\r\nmelting snow.\r\n\r\nIn the Quarterly Journal of the Astronomical Society of Wales, the Rev.\r\nTheo. E. R. Phillips publishes an excellent drawing of Mars in color.\r\nIn this drawing he shows a large number of regions, a number of canals,\r\nand other features which, he says, \"came out with the clearness and\r\nsharpness of an engraving, and bore no resemblance to the 'diffused\r\nstreaks' or amorphous smudges one sees for the canals in imperfect\r\nseeing.\" In this drawing the polar snow caps show with remarkable\r\nvividness.\r\n\r\nProfessor W. H. Pickering, in a continuous record of observations on\r\nMars, published in the \"Annals of the Lowell Observatory,\" records\r\nunder August 20: \"The dark north canals are also noticeable, and, had\r\nthey looked as they now do, could not possibly have been missed on the\r\n16th.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Phil. Fauth has, with a seven inch objective, drawn and published\r\nsixty-three drawings of Mars in which a great many canals are shown, a\r\nlist of which he presents in his memoir on the subject.\r\n\r\nThe lamented Perrotin, for some time Director of the Nice Observatory,\r\nin company with M. Janssen, at Meudon, observed Mars through the great\r\nequatorial (32-2/3 inch), and published the results in the \"Comptes\r\nRendues\" (Vol. CXXIV, No. 7). He describes the several zones, the\r\nnorthern equatorial zone \"being more particularly the zone of the\r\nextraordinary canals, the discovery of which we owe to Schiaparelli,\r\nand to which we ourselves, by our publication, in 1886, called the\r\nattention of the astronomical world.\"\r\n\r\nThe London \"Nature,\" March 17, 1904, in noting the death of M. Henry\r\nPerrotin, speaks of him as one of the ablest advocates of astronomical\r\nscience. He devoted much time to Mars. \"Aware that he was working\r\nat the extreme limit of visibility, and knowing the tendency for\r\nself-deception to creep in and impair the value of such delicate\r\nobservations, he sought opportunities of making similar measures and\r\nrecords with different instruments, and under varied conditions, in\r\norder to remove, so far as possible, the evils of bias and partiality\r\nfrom the results of his researches.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Terby of Louvain, in a memoir entitled \"Physical Observations\r\nof Mars,\" a translation of which appeared in the \"Astronomical and\r\nAstrophysical Journal,\" No. 106, identifies many of Schiaparelli's\r\n_canali_ and other details depicted in Schiaparelli's map of Mars. In\r\nconclusion Dr. Terby says: \"After what we have seen we dare affirm\r\nthat henceforth the progress of areography will be in the hands of\r\nthose alone who, freeing themselves from the shackles of doubt, will\r\nresolutely engage in the way traced by the celebrated astronomer of\r\nMilan. A new era has begun in the study of Mars by the discovery of\r\ncanals and their doubling, and by the micrometric determination of one\r\nhundred and fourteen fundamental points on the map, an era succeeding\r\nto that which was inaugurated a half century ago by the construction\r\nof the first two hemispheres and by the approximate fixing of fourteen\r\npoints by Mäedler.\" Dr. Terby further says: \"But these results have\r\nan incontestable value in the presence of the incredulity with which\r\ncertain astronomers still consider the beautiful discoveries of Milan.\r\nWho would believe it? In spite of the beautiful drawings of M. Perrotin\r\none reads still that the discoveries of M. Schiaparelli have not been\r\nconfirmed by the largest instruments.\"\r\n\r\nIn \"Astronomy and Astrophysics,\" No. 108, is published a series\r\nof contributions on Mars by Professors Edward C. Holden, William\r\nH. Pickering, C. A. Young, Lewis Swift, George C. Comstock, E. E.\r\nBarnard, and H. C. Wilson. All of these men are astronomers and all are\r\nconnected as directors or observers with various observatories in the\r\nUnited States. Many sent sketches, most of them saw the canals, all saw\r\nthe polar snow caps and darker regions. To say that these astronomers\r\nwere sketching details which existed only in their imagination is\r\nsimply preposterous.\r\n\r\nProfessor Herbert A. Howe, Director of the Chamberlin Observatory,\r\nat Denver, in his \"Elements of Descriptive Astronomy\" says: \"If we\r\nhave simply to answer the question, 'Would a man, as constituted at\r\npresent, if transported to Mars find it possible to exist there?' The\r\nmost probable answer is, 'No.' While one must not be dogmatic, it may\r\nbe said, with some assurance, that the man would gasp a few times and\r\ndie. However, it is conceivable that manlike beings might find a home\r\nthere.\" Mr. Howe could have said without being dogmatic that a man thus\r\ntransported would die of what is known as Caisson disease.\r\n\r\nAmong those who assert that the canals are artificial we have Professor\r\nPercival Lowell as pre-eminent. He has erected an observatory in the\r\nregion of one of the clearest atmospheres in the world, has furnished\r\nit with the finest telescope that Clark ever made, and for the chief\r\npurpose of studying the surface features of Mars. In his interesting\r\nbook on Mars he has presented the results of his observations in so\r\nlucid and convincing a manner that a reviewer of the English edition\r\nof the work, in an English astronomical journal, is led to write:\r\n\"We may say at once that we feel bound to accept these observations\r\nas sufficient evidence of the real existence of the markings without\r\nexpressing an opinion as to what they may be.\" The reviewer ends by\r\nsaying: \"Indeed, there is a subtle deftness in the way Mr. Lowell\r\ndeals with his observations which gives the impression that he has\r\nbeen there and seen it all, and it is really hard to say why we cannot\r\naccept his conclusions. It is probable, because we are shy to receive\r\nnew facts at a first statement. In time, no doubt, we shall be willing\r\nto accept his deductions (or facts) as to the markings. We were about\r\nto advance objections, but they seem poor, and really it is a case\r\nwhere each person must read and form his own ideas--but by all means\r\nread.\"\r\n\r\nWe have already presented a summary of his observations. We may add\r\nhere, however, an extract from his book on the solar system. In this\r\nMr. Lowell says of Mars: \"What we see hints of the existence of beings\r\nwho are in advance of, not behind us in the journey of life,\" and\r\nagain: \"Life on Mars must take on a very different guise from what\r\nit wears on the Earth. It is certain there can be no man there--that\r\nis as certain as anything can be. But this does not preclude a local\r\nintelligence equal to, and perhaps easily superior to, our own. We\r\nseem to have evidence that something of the sort does exist there at\r\nthe present moment and has made imprint of its existence far exceeding\r\nanything we have left on Mother Earth.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge W. Morehouse, in his \"Wilderness of Worlds,\" says: \"Taken all\r\ntogether we must regard Mars as probably an inhabited world and very\r\nsimilar to the Earth.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Hector Macpherson, Jr., member of the Astronomical Society of\r\nFrance, in his interesting book \"Astronomers of To-day,\" says, in\r\nregard to Mr. Lowell's book on Mars: \"He does not ask us to believe\r\nanything fantastical or extravagant. His hypothesis has been framed to\r\naccount for all the various Martian features. At present we can only\r\nsay that it is the most comprehensive and probable theory yet advanced\r\nto explain the phenomena of the red planet.\"\r\n\r\nProfessor Todd, Director of the Astronomical Observatory at Amherst\r\nCollege, in his book on Stars and Telescopes, in referring to drawings\r\nof a region in the southern portion of Mars, known as the Solis Lacus,\r\nand a complicated drawing of another region, says: \"Whether one views\r\nthis marvellous and intricate system as a whole, or in some portion of\r\nhigh detail, it is difficult to escape the conviction that the _canali_\r\nhave, at least in part, been designed and executed with a definite end\r\nin view.\"\r\n\r\nThere are many who do not deny the existence of some forms of life on\r\nthe planet, but are not prepared to admit the existence of intelligent\r\ncreatures. Sir Robert Ball expresses himself as follows: \"That there\r\nmay be types of life of some kind on Mars is, I should think, quite\r\nlikely.\"\r\n\r\nThe number of astronomers above quoted, who have seen and drawn the\r\ncanals, might be augmented, but a sufficient number have been cited to\r\nshow that the evidence of the presence of these markings does not rest\r\nwith a few, furthermore, some of these observers can only interpret\r\nthe markings as the result of intelligent action. It may be urged that\r\namong those quoted are some whose opinion may not have great weight\r\nsince they are not professional astronomers. One must insist that the\r\nstudy of planetary markings as well as the interpretation of their\r\nmeanings comes not only within the province of planetary astronomers,\r\nbut that any broad-minded man, with an acute eye and familiar with the\r\nsciences connected with the surface features of the Earth, is quite\r\ncompetent to make observations of his own and to judge of the merits of\r\nthe question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nTHE STUDY OF PLANETARY MARKINGS\r\n\r\n        _Their singular aspect, and the fact that they are drawn\r\n        with absolute geometric precision as if they were the\r\n        product of rule and compass, have induced some people to\r\n        see in them the work of intelligent beings, inhabitants\r\n        of the planet. I should be careful not to combat this\r\n        supposition which involves no impossibility._\r\n\r\n                SCHIAPARELLI.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a question whether, after all, the study of planetary markings\r\ncomes within the province of astronomers. Not more, perhaps, than the\r\nstudy of physical geography and subjects connected with the surface\r\nfeatures of the Earth, comes under the cognizance of those whose\r\nprofession it is to determine the oscillation of the pole, the Earth's\r\nmovements due to the Moon, etc. Indeed, these lines of research are\r\nstrictly astronomical. With the study of the surface markings of\r\nthe Moon, or Mars, features of an entirely different kind are to be\r\ninterpreted, and quite a different equipment is necessary. It is no\r\nwonder, then, that astronomers, the most conservative of all classes\r\nof investigators, should view with suspicion the results of the work of\r\nSchiaparelli, Lowell and others. Immersed in mathematics, trusting in\r\nnothing that cannot be measured and reckoned, as a class holding their\r\nimagination in abeyance, is it any surprise that they should present an\r\nattitude of indifference and even hostility to the work of those who,\r\ndifferently equipped mentally, have attempted a definition and solution\r\nof the riddle of the Martian markings? To appreciate how foreign to the\r\nstudies of an astronomer is the interpretation of the canals of Mars,\r\none has simply to scan the index of any astronomical publication, or\r\nthe titles of papers in the transactions of astronomical societies.\r\nFor example, take volumes XX and XXI of the \"Astronomical Journal\" and\r\ntabulate the papers, memoirs, etc., therein published, numbering two\r\nhundred and thirty-eight, and we find of these, seventy-four on the\r\nstars; sixty-two on the comets; nineteen on planets and satellites,\r\nmostly mathematical; eighteen on the Sun; eighteen on the asteroids;\r\nfifteen on Eros; ten on polar motion and latitude; four on Nova Persei;\r\nand seventeen miscellaneous, consisting of logarithms, instruments,\r\nGegenschein, etc.; and only one on Mars, and this on the polar snow\r\ncaps!\r\n\r\nAs to the question whether it is more important to add another to the\r\nthousands of variable stars and binaries, and hundreds of asteroids,\r\nalready determined, or to consider whether we are alone in the universe\r\nand, if so, the significance of it, I think with the intelligent public\r\nthere can be no doubt.\r\n\r\nA fair sample of the subjects which occupy the astronomers' mind, and\r\nwhich are so remote from the study of planetary markings, and have so\r\nlittle interest for the public, may be gathered from the following list\r\nselected at random from an astronomical publication. Notes on variable\r\nstars; Maxima and minima of long period variables; Micrometrical\r\nmeasurements of the companion of Procyon; The problem of three bodies;\r\nEphemeris of Comet a, 1901; On the eruptive energy of the stars;\r\nEclipse cycles; Determinations of the aberration-constant from right\r\nascension; Theory of a resisting medium upon bodies moving in parabolic\r\norbits; Weights and systematic corrections of meridian observation in\r\nright ascension and declination; and other titles equally profound.\r\nMany of these memoirs consist of hundreds of pages of figures, and, as\r\na friend of mine observed, not a column footed up! Take for example\r\na title like the following: \"Method of developing the perturbative\r\nfunctions, also precepts for executing their development.\" This memoir\r\nis accompanied by pages of algebraic formulæ which the layman turns\r\nover in despair, the only illumination consisting of a few words in\r\nEnglish which render the gloom still more apparent,--such words as\r\n\"hence,\" \"or,\" \"we therefore have,\" \"if we put.\" Of what we \"have,\"\r\nand why we \"put,\" we are left in profound ignorance. Now I venture to\r\nbelieve that the great world of humanity takes but little interest\r\nin such pages, or in the kinds of titles above given, though fully\r\nrealizing that they mean something and represent important steps\r\nin astronomic research. It would add greatly to the value of these\r\ncontributions if a brief summary in plain English could be given at the\r\nend of these papers, but it is the rarest event that these collectors\r\nof data ever make any generalizations, or form any deductions.\r\n\r\nMy faith in the appalling character of algebraic formulæ[5] received\r\na rude shock when I learned of an experience of Louise Michel, the\r\nanarchist, who was transported for life to New Caledonia (afterwards\r\npardoned). On arriving at the savage island, true to her humanitarian\r\ninstincts, \"she immediately established a school for native children,\r\nwho by a curious freak of their minds, she noted with rejoicing, took\r\nnaturally to algebra before they learned arithmetic!\"\r\n\r\nHovenden quotes Huxley as saying that mathematics \"is that study\r\nthat knows nothing of observation, nothing of induction, nothing of\r\nexperiment, nothing of causation.\" He also quotes the words of Clerk\r\nMaxwell, who said, in regard to mathematicians, that it was \"doubtful\r\nwhether the ideas as expressed in symbols had ever quite found their\r\nway out of the equations into their minds.\" They never seem to appeal\r\nto the doctrine of probabilities nor do they in any way permit\r\nimagination to act as a stimulus to suggestive thought.\r\n\r\nLeast of all would a layman ridicule or question the painstaking labor\r\ninvolved in astronomic work, though he cannot see a glimmer of light or\r\nintelligence in the enigmatical pages. A certain class of astronomers\r\nmight take a lesson from an intelligent public in ceasing to scoff\r\nand ridicule what they are unable to see themselves in the Martian\r\nmarkings. The chief work of these men indicates the cold precise\r\nmeasuring of points of light in the heavens, the determination of\r\norbits, elements and ephemeris of heavenly bodies, the determination\r\nof solar parallax, etc., most of the subjects strictly mathematical,\r\na question of careful measurements for which the necessary instruments\r\nare at hand, or simply sweeping the heavens for a new variable, binary\r\nor asteroid. Parallaxes and orbits are matters of measurement to be\r\nreckoned by the figures of anybody else. It is obvious from all this\r\nthat little or no interest is manifested by astronomers in planetary\r\nmarkings, least of all in those of Mars. The exasperating feature of\r\nthe matter is that they persistently repudiate the observation of\r\nothers equally well equipped, and endowed with the same enthusiasm and\r\ndevotion to their work.\r\n\r\nThe way in which the gatherers of the raw material arrogate to\r\nthemselves the science of astronomy, relegating the thinkers and\r\ngeneralizers to the limbo of speculation, is as if the book-keepers of\r\na corporation should assume themselves to be the master-minds of the\r\nconcern and the banker, or financier, at the head of it, a dreamer not\r\nworth regarding.\r\n\r\nAn illustration of the conservativeness of astronomers in regard to\r\nplanetary markings is shown in their cautious attitude concerning the\r\npolar snow caps of Mars. Here are white polar caps on Mars, precisely\r\nwhere they ought to be if they _are_ snow, they wax and wane at\r\nthe time they should and at no other time, a dark band appears at\r\ntheir borders as the caps in turn diminish in size, which has been\r\ninterpreted as water due to the melting snow, and no other substance\r\nknown could possibly reproduce these varying conditions. Professor C.\r\nA. Young, in describing these white areas, says: \"The one which happens\r\nto be turned toward the Sun continually diminishes in size, while\r\nthe other increases, the process being reversed with the seasons of\r\nthe planet.\" After these admissions Professor Young cautiously says:\r\n\"These are believed to be ice caps.\" Sir John Herschel says: \"The\r\nvariety in the spots may arise from the planet not being destitute of\r\natmosphere and clouds, and what adds greatly to the probability of\r\nthis is the appearance of brilliant white spots at the poles--one of\r\nwhich appears in our figure--which have been conjectured with some\r\nprobability to be snow, as they disappear when they have been long\r\nexposed to the Sun, and are greatest when just emerging from the long\r\nnight of the polar winter.\" Had Michael Faraday been an astronomer,\r\nhow long would it have taken him to pronounce these white polar caps\r\nsnow and ice? De la Rive, in his memoir of Faraday, in speaking of his\r\nmarvellous accomplishments, says: \"One may easily understand what must\r\nbe produced under such circumstances by a life thus wholly consecrated\r\nto science, when to a strong and vigorous intellect is joined a most\r\nbrilliant imagination.\" Tyndall, in his discourse \"On the Scientific\r\nuse of the Imagination,\" says: \"Bounded and conditioned by co-operant\r\nreason, imagination becomes the mightiest instrument of the physical\r\ndiscoverer. Newton's passage from a falling apple to a falling Moon was\r\na leap of the imagination.\"\r\n\r\nThat Herbert Hall Turner, Professor of Astronomy in the University\r\nof Oxford, does not regard the various contributions on the surface\r\nfeatures of Mars as belonging to astronomical science may be inferred\r\nfrom his interesting book lately published, entitled \"Astronomical\r\nDiscovery.\" This book presents to us the history of the discovery of\r\nUranus and Eros, of Neptune, Bradley's aberration of light, Schwabe and\r\nsun-spot period, the variation of latitude, etc., but not a word about\r\nthe marvellous discoveries of the _canali_ of Mars by Schiaparelli, so\r\nfully confirmed by the observation and drawings of many others, and the\r\ngreat advances made by Lowell in the discovery of new features with his\r\nlucid and rational interpretation of the seeming enigmas.\r\n\r\nAstronomy, the oldest and most conservative of all the sciences, has\r\nbeen the last to subdivide. Already one group of men has justified\r\nby its work a division of the science known as astrophysics. The\r\nlamented Keeler, in explaining the difference between astronomy and\r\nastrophysics, said: \"Astrophysics seeks to ascertain the nature of the\r\nheavenly bodies, rather than their positions and motions in space,\r\n_what_ they are, rather than _where_ they are.\" This natural division\r\nsuggests the propriety of making another division equally distinct,\r\nwhich should comprise the study and interpretation of the surface\r\nmarkings of the planets and satellites, under the name of planetology.\r\nThe study would be the application to these bodies of the science\r\nof geology, in its broadest sense, meteorology, physical geography,\r\ngeodesy, and related sciences.\r\n\r\nWith the science of planetology established, the student of this\r\nscience will no longer call to his aid the astronomer, and, least of\r\nall, the astrophysicist, nor will he be mindful of their criticism or\r\nneglect. He will appeal to the sciences which are involved in the study\r\nof the surface features of his own globe, in the interpretation of\r\nplanetary detail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nDIFFICULTIES OF SEEING\r\n\r\n        _It is contrary to all the analogies of nature to suppose\r\n        that life began only on a single world._\r\n\r\n                SIMON NEWCOMB.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor years I had been familiar with different representations of Mars\r\nin which the surface features had been strongly depicted in black and\r\nwhite; in other words, photo-reliefs, or engravings incorporated with\r\nthe printed page. I had unwittingly come to believe that these features\r\nwere equally distinct when one observed Mars through the telescope. I\r\nhad not then seen Schiaparelli's original memoir in which his wonderful\r\nmap presents the canals in light and tenuous lines, which are, however,\r\nas clear cut as the lines of a steel engraving, to use his words. For\r\na long time I had hoped for a chance to observe Mars through a large\r\ntelescope in a clear and steady atmosphere. It seemed reasonable to\r\nme--knowing nothing about it--that one who had traced out under the\r\nmicroscope delicate lines and structural features in diaphanous\r\nmembranes, who had, in fact, used a microscope with high powers for\r\nforty years, would find it child's play to make out the canals, oases,\r\nregions, etc., of Mars, as represented in the various publications on\r\nthe subject. Professor Percival Lowell, of Flagstaff, Arizona, finally\r\ngave me the opportunity I so much desired, and, through his courtesy\r\nand kindness, I was enabled to observe Mars every night for nearly six\r\nweeks through his twenty-four inch refractor, the last and probably\r\nthe best telescope ever made by Clark, mounted in one of the steadiest\r\natmospheres in the world and at an altitude above sea-level of over\r\n7,000 feet. Imagine my surprise and chagrin when I first saw the\r\nbeautiful disk of Mars through this superb telescope. Not a line! not a\r\nmarking! The object I saw could only be compared in appearance to the\r\nopen mouth of a crucible filled with molten gold. Slight discolorations\r\nhere and there and evanescent areas outlined for the tenth of a second,\r\nbut not a determinate line or spot to be seen. Had I stopped that\r\nnight, or even a week later, I might have joined the ranks of certain\r\nobservers and said \"illusion\" or something worse. And right here it\r\nwas that my experience in microscopic work helped me, for, remembering\r\nthe hours--nay, days--I had worked, in making out structural features\r\nin delicate organisms which my unprofessional friends could not see at\r\nall, I realized that patient observation would be required if I was to\r\nbe successful in my efforts. My despair, however, was overwhelming when\r\nProfessor Lowell and his assistants, looking for a few moments at the\r\nsame object, would draw on paper the features which had been plainly\r\nrevealed to them, consisting of definite shaded regions, a number of\r\ncanals and other markings, of which, with the utmost scrutiny, I could\r\nhardly detect a trace. For the first time I realized that observing\r\nfixed diaphanous membranes under a microscope with rigid stand, and\r\nwithin four inches of one's nose, was quite a different matter from\r\nobserving a brilliant disk 4,200 miles in diameter, 52,000,000 miles\r\naway, with an oscillating atmosphere of unknown depth between. Night\r\nafter night I examined this golden, opalescent disk, drawing each\r\ntime such features as I could convey by memory from the ocular to the\r\ndrawing table, and, little by little, new features were detected, and\r\nto my delight the drawings agreed with those made by the others. Since\r\nthe drawings made by the four observers coincided, it was evident that\r\nwe had not been victims of subjective phenomena. Furthermore, as I\r\ndiscovered afterwards, by comparison, the drawings I made not only\r\nagreed with theirs but with those made by other observers, at different\r\ntimes, in other parts of the world. So slow were my acquisitions,\r\nhowever, that it soon became evident that at least months of continuous\r\nobservation would be necessary before the more delicate markings would\r\nbe revealed to me. It is interesting to learn that others have had a\r\nsimilar experience. Mr. A. Stanley Williams, of England, in an article\r\nentitled \"Notes on Mars\" (\"Observatory,\" June, 1899), in stating the\r\ndifficulties of observation, says: \"My eye invariably requires at least\r\ntwo months of continuous observation of a planet before it acquires its\r\nfull sensitiveness to the most minute details.\"\r\n\r\nIn this connection it is well to state that Mr. Lowell began the\r\nobservation of Mars when he was a mere boy. His first telescope, which\r\nhe still has, was a two and a quarter inch refractor. His observations\r\nwere made from the roof of his house in Boston, and with this small\r\nglass he defined the general shaded regions that Huyghens had detected\r\nand drawn in 1659. Since then Mr. Lowell has observed in turn through\r\na six inch, an eighteen inch of Brashear, and, for the last few years,\r\nthrough a twenty-four inch refractor made by Clark especially for this\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nTo refute the accumulated observations of Mr. Lowell one must have the\r\nsame acute eye, and a record of the same continuous and devoted study.\r\nNothing short of that experience will avail. The jealous derision that\r\nhas gone up from some observers endowed with less acuteness of vision\r\nis neither dignified nor just. Were these Martian details based upon\r\nthe observations of Lowell alone, one might be inclined to say that\r\nsome vagary of the mind had led him to imagine these markings which\r\nwere first detected by the great Italian astronomer Schiaparelli. Up\r\nto the present time--to mention only a few--observations and drawings\r\nhave been made by Perrotin, Thollon, and Flammarion, of France; Dr.\r\nPhil. Fauth, of Germany; Williams, of England; Lowell, W. H. Pickering,\r\nDouglass, Lampland, and Schaeberle, of America, while many others have\r\nmade drawings of the more conspicuous details. With this record it is\r\nimpossible to deny the existence of these markings essentially as they\r\nare drawn.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of seeing the more delicate markings of the planet\r\nis unquestionable, and an examination of astronomical literature,\r\nfrom which we shall make numerous quotations, indicates only too\r\nplainly the acuteness of vision, and the time and care necessary to\r\nmake competent observations. Sir Robert Ball says, in one of his\r\nrecent works: \"The detection of the Martian features indicates one\r\nof the utmost refinements of astronomical observations.\" Macpherson,\r\nin his \"Astronomers of To-day,\" thus writes of Schiaparelli,\r\n\"Professor Schiaparelli's observations have been distinguished by his\r\nkeen-sightedness and care. He has taken every precaution to avoid all\r\ndisturbances resulting from personal equation, and has found it well\r\nto adopt the rule (which he here quotes) 'to abstain from everything\r\nwhich could affect the nervous system, from narcotics and alcohol, and\r\nespecially from the abuse of coffee, which I found to be exceedingly\r\nprejudicial to the accuracy of observation.'\" What I might have\r\naccomplished in the way of seeing had I followed the wise example of\r\nSchiaparelli I do not know. A not too strict abstemiousness in any of\r\nthese matters, coupled with long daily walks on the Mesa, with its\r\nfascinating flora and fauna, found me in the observer's chair every\r\nnight, somewhat fatigued mentally and physically.\r\n\r\nSir Robert Ball, in his \"Popular Guide to the Heavens,\" in describing\r\nthe difficulty in making out the more delicate markings of Mars,\r\nsays: \"It should be understood that in the unsteady air of England it\r\nis almost hopeless to expect many of the finer details; not even in\r\nthe most favorable climates are they to be seen always, or all at\r\nonce, and much training of the eye is required before it is fit to\r\ndecide for or against the existence of these details on the verge of\r\ninvisibility.\" As another illustration, perhaps, of the difficulties\r\nof seeing, Sir Robert, in the same book, says: \"Observers of Mars are\r\ndivided into two camps, those who see the canals, and those who do not.\r\nThe former are in the strong position that they are perfectly sure that\r\nthey see what they represent in their drawings.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing it must be evident that not only are the finer\r\nmarkings on Mars most difficult to see even under the best conditions\r\nbut that exceptional acuteness of vision, which few possess, united\r\nwith long practice, is necessary to make out the tenuous lines which\r\nenclose the field of Mars like a net. That Mr. Lowell has had a long\r\nand continuous practice, covering years, in observing Mars through\r\nthe steadiest of atmospheres and with a superb glass, is simply a\r\nstatement of fact. It may be said without fear of contradiction that\r\nhe has devoted more time to the observation of Mars than all the other\r\nobservers combined. Has he then an exceptional acuteness of sight,\r\ncoupled with indefatigable industry, in the pursuit of this quest to\r\nwhich he is devoting his life and fortune? The following instance\r\nwill illustrate his marvellous eyesight. We were walking along the\r\nshores of a lake some miles from Flagstaff, the expanse of shore left\r\nby the rapidly evaporating waters abounding with thousands of very\r\nsmall black spiders running hither and thither at our approach. I\r\ntold him of one I had just seen in which the abdomen was covered with\r\nminute young spiders which the mother was carrying about with her--a\r\nwell-known habit of certain species. This curious fact I had detected\r\nonly while stooping close to the ground in search of minute shells. Mr.\r\nLowell, while walking along, immediately began scanning the ground for\r\nthe trace of a spider with minutely granulated abdomen, and finally\r\nexclaimed: \"There is one of them!\" On stooping down to examine the\r\nobject it proved to my astonishment to be a female carrying its young\r\nin the way already described. This incident revealed a remarkable\r\nacuteness of vision to detect, while standing erect and walking,\r\nthis tiny spider among hundreds of others of its species that were\r\nscampering away at our approach.\r\n\r\nNot only is acuteness of vision necessary to one who is to study\r\nplanetary markings, but of importance also is a clear, and above all\r\na steady atmosphere; and, strange as it may appear, telescopes of\r\nmoderate size seem to be the instruments with which the best work has\r\nbeen done. It is also true in astronomy, as in warfare, that it is not\r\nthe biggest gun but the man behind the gun that does the most efficient\r\nwork. As an evidence of the importance of steady atmosphere Professor\r\nW. H. Pickering, in his observations on the satellites of Jupiter,\r\nsays his work had two important bearings: \"First, as showing the\r\nrelative importance of atmosphere _versus_ aperture for delicate visual\r\nobservations of this sort. In the same category would be included\r\nstudies of planetary detail as distinguished from the examination of\r\nvery faint objects. In other words, if an observer wishes to study\r\nvery faint stars he must have a large telescope. If he wishes to study\r\nthe neighboring planets and brighter satellites he may use a small\r\ntelescope, but he must have a very good atmosphere.\"\r\n\r\nThe importance of a clear and steady atmosphere, for delicate\r\nobservation, is known to all astronomers. The rarity of such days,\r\neven in our clear atmosphere so superior to that of England, is not\r\ngenerally known. Forty years ago Dr. Henry Draper, in an address\r\nentitled \"Are Other Worlds Inhabited?\" in speaking of Mars and the\r\ndifficulties of seeing, said: \"One of the greatest obstacles to\r\ndistinct vision is our own atmosphere. Its currents and motions tend\r\nto confuse the outlines of objects, and, according to my experience, a\r\nwhole year may pass without the occurrence of more than one good night.\r\nThe only remedy is to carry the telescope as high up on a mountain\r\nas possible, so as to leave below the more injurious portions of the\r\natmosphere. It might be possible to work 15,000 feet above the sea in\r\nthe neighborhood of the Equator.\" I quote these words that the general\r\nreader may appreciate the advantages Lowell has with his fine telescope\r\nsouth of all European observatories, in the latitude, say of Algiers,\r\nat a high altitude, and in the dry and steady atmosphere of Arizona,\r\nwith uninterrupted seeing for weeks together, and each night far\r\nsuperior to any night which Greenwich could ever be blessed with.\r\n\r\nProfessor W. H. Pickering attests to the importance of a steady\r\natmosphere in studying the Moon from a station in Jamaica, when he\r\nsays that, with a five inch refractor, he was able to detect minute\r\ndetails which were not revealed by the far larger telescopes at Harvard\r\nUniversity.\r\n\r\nMr. W. D. Barbour, President of the Leeds Astronomical Society, using\r\nhis four inch achromatic, says: \"In one of those brief intervals\r\nof atmospheric steadiness I saw distinctly a number of well-known\r\nmarkings,\" the names of which he gives. Dr. Phil. Fauth, using a seven\r\ninch refractor, made sixty-three drawings of Mars, showing in wonderful\r\ndetail the canals, oases, etc. Mr. W. J. Lockyer, in London \"Nature,\"\r\ntestifies that \"a keen and patient observer, sitting at the eyepiece of\r\na comparatively small equatorially mounted telescope, if he makes his\r\nobservations carefully, and with due regard to atmospheric conditions\r\nfor good seeing, can do more useful and valuable work than one who has\r\na large aperture at his command and employs it indifferently.\" Mr. E.\r\nLedger, in speaking of Dawes, who made a remarkable map of Mars, says\r\nhe was justly famed for the remarkable distinctness of his vision; he\r\nhad detected and drawn a few lines which seemed to be identical to\r\nthose of Schiaparelli.\r\n\r\nIn the authorities above quoted we have endeavored to show that a\r\nsteady atmosphere, a persistent devotion to the work, accompanied by\r\nacute vision, and also a talent for observation, are all the factors\r\nneeded, not only to confirm the remarkable discoveries of Schiaparelli\r\nand Lowell, but possibly to detect, at favorable moments, new features\r\nwhich have escaped the eyes of these keen observers.\r\n\r\nAt this point we cannot resist giving the words of Sir David Gill,\r\nDirector of the Royal Observatory at the Cape of Good Hope. Professor\r\nS. W. Burnham, of the Lick Observatory, in reviewing a memoir entitled\r\n\"Double Star Observations at the Cape of Good Hope,\" quotes as\r\nfollows from the preface: \"Sir David Gill, in speaking of the routine\r\ncharacter of the work involved in the investigation, says: 'There is\r\nno instance, as far as I know, of a long and valuable series of double\r\nstar discovery and observation made by a mere assistant acting under\r\norders. _It is a special faculty, an inborn capacity, a delight in the\r\nexercise of exceptional acuteness of eyesight and natural dexterity,\r\ncoupled with the gift of imagination as to the true meaning of what he\r\nobserves, that imparts to the observer the requisite enthusiasm for\r\ndouble star observing._ No amount of training or direction could have\r\ncreated the Struves, a Dawes, or a Dembowski. _The great double star\r\nobserver is born, not made_, and I believe that no extensive series of\r\ndouble star measurement will ever emanate from a regular observatory,\r\nthrough successive directorates, unless men are specially selected\r\nwho have previously distinguished themselves in that field of work,\r\nand who were originally driven to it from sheer compulsion of inborn\r\ntaste.'\" If the reader will substitute the words _planetary markings_\r\nfor _double star_ in the above quotation from Sir David Gill's report,\r\nhe will understand why we have ventured to italicise certain lines, and\r\nwill appreciate their significance. In no stronger or truer words could\r\none have emphasized the conditions involved in a critical study of the\r\nsurface features of Mars.\r\n\r\nIn the experience of an astronomer, it is not an unusual occurrence\r\nthat an object in the heavens, fairly conspicuous, remains unseen\r\nuntil by some lucky chance an observer sweeping the sky picks it\r\nup, and, having determined its position, it is promptly found by\r\nothers. Professor H. H. Turner, in his \"Astronomical Discovery of the\r\nNineteenth Century,\" says: \"It is a common experience in astronomy that\r\nan observer may fail to notice in a general scrutiny, some phenomenon\r\nwhich he can see perfectly well when his attention is called to it;\r\nwhen a man has made a discovery, and others are told what to look for,\r\nthey often see it so easily that they are filled with amazement and\r\nchagrin that they never saw it before.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Rev. T. W. Webb's interesting book on \"Celestial Objects for\r\nCommon Telescopes,\" a reminiscence of the author is given by a friend\r\nin which the following is related as illustrating the varying ability\r\nof observers in seeing. \"A curious instance of difference of vision was\r\nwell illustrated one superb evening when Mr. Webb and the writer were\r\nobserving Saturn with the nine and a half inch refractor at Hardwick.\r\nMr. Webb saw distinctly the division in the outer ring which the writer\r\ncould not see a trace of, while the writer picked up a faint point of\r\nlight which afterwards turned out to be Enceladus (a satellite) which\r\nMr. Webb could not see.\"\r\n\r\nIn my brief observation of Mars I probably might have made out many\r\nmore details if I had permitted Mr. Lowell to tell me what to see, and\r\nwhere to look for them on the disk. This I would not allow him to do,\r\nnor did I study any of the numerous drawings in his own work, or the\r\noriginal memoirs of Schiaparelli, or other works containing drawings of\r\nMars in his library. I would not learn the names of any of the regions,\r\nor canals, nor with a single exception do I know them now. Only when\r\nI had finished my last night's observations, did Mr. Lowell take my\r\ndrawings and write out a list of the various canals, oases, etc., which\r\nI had made out. Thus, unaided, I drew simply what was plainly evident,\r\nthough many other details flashed out for a second, which were not\r\nrecorded, simply because I did not see them often enough to be sure of\r\ntheir precise position on the disk.\r\n\r\nMr. Lowell points out one of the reasons why so many observers and\r\nastronomers have not seen the canals. In the third volume of the\r\n\"Annals of the Lowell Observatory\" he refers to a certain series of\r\nobservations of Mars, made in 1894, and says: \"Not only was there\r\nno sign of a canal, but even the main markings showed disheartingly\r\nindefinite.\" \"This vacancy of expression was due to the Martian date.\"\r\n\"It was the very nick of time to see nothing, for the part of the\r\nplanet most presented to the Earth was then at the height of the dead\r\nseason, and in this fact lies the key to much past undetection and\r\npresent unbelief in the phenomenon of the canals.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nVARIATION IN DRAWING\r\n\r\n        _Let us not cheat ourselves with words. Conservatism sounds\r\n        finely and covers any amount of ignorance and fear._\r\n\r\n                PERCIVAL LOWELL.\r\n\r\n\r\nMuch doubt has been expressed as to the existence of the so-called\r\ncanals in Mars and other surface markings of that planet in consequence\r\nof the discrepancy seen in the drawings of the more delicate features\r\nby various observers. While in the main a certain general resemblance\r\nis seen in the topographical character of the network of lines,\r\nand a more close resemblance in the darker markings, notably the\r\nSyrtis Major, the disagreement in the minor details has led certain\r\nastronomers to deny their existence altogether, or to insist that most\r\nof the markings were subjective, or due to poor focusing, or the result\r\nof aberration of the eye or lens. Professor Simon Newcomb, in his \"New\r\nAstronomy for Everybody,\" in speaking of the work of the observers at\r\nthe Lick Observatory and the great telescope at their command coupled\r\nwith favorable situation, says: \"It is therefore noteworthy that the\r\nmarkings on the face of Mars as presented by Barnard do not quite\r\ncorrespond to the channels of Schiaparelli and Lowell.\" Newcomb also\r\nreproduces in his book the drawings of a region in Mars known as Solis\r\nLacus, made by Campbell and Hussey, and finds they do not show an exact\r\nagreement between them. Now such objections might have some weight if\r\ndrawings made by different observers of the Solar Corona, for example,\r\nor the Nebula of Orion, or the Milky Way had any close resemblance.\r\nAs a matter of fact, these various drawings depart far more widely\r\nfrom the originals, as shown by photographic reproduction, than do\r\nthe various drawings of Mars. Mr. Fison, in his \"Recent Advances in\r\nAstronomy,\" in speaking of the divergence in the drawings made by\r\ndifferent observers, says: \"In inspecting sketches of the delicate\r\ndetails of the Corona of the Sun made at the same place by different\r\nobservers, it is difficult to believe that the same object has been\r\nrepresented.\" To appreciate how widely divergent such drawings are one\r\nhas only to refer to the United States Naval Observatory publication on\r\nthe Total Eclipse of the Sun, July 29, 1878.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE II\r\n\r\nDRAWINGS OF THE SOLAR CORONA BY VARIOUS OBSERVERS]\r\n\r\nAs an indication of the dissimilarity of the drawings of the Corona\r\nmade at the same instant by different observers, many of whom are\r\nwell-known astronomers, I may say that the various plates resemble in\r\nturn the following objects: a skate's egg-case; a circular battery\r\ndischarging fire from one side while the smoke drifts away in the\r\nopposite direction; an ascidian, known as Molgula, with an extra\r\naperture, however; a snowshoe; a radiolarian; a fighting shield of\r\nan Igorrote savage; an egg of a hair worm; a crushed spider, and\r\nother equally dissimilar objects. I have reproduced a few of these\r\ndrawings (Plate II), that the reader may realize that my similes are\r\nnot exaggerated. The many drawings which have been made of the Nebula\r\nof Orion, by astronomers of distinction, depart quite as widely from\r\neach other as do those of the Solar Corona. In Volume XXV of the \"Naval\r\nObservatory Observations\" is published a monograph of the central parts\r\nof the Nebula of Orion, by Professor E. S. Holden. He starts with\r\na drawing made by Huyghens in 1659 and ends with a drawing made by\r\nProfessor Langley in 1879. In a summary of the work the author says:\r\n\"I am acquainted with but one drawing of the Nebula which is entirely\r\nabove criticism, that of the late G. P. Bond. He was a skilled artist,\"\r\netc. An examination of the drawings in this Memoir are equally\r\ndistracting. In looking at them casually they suggest respectively a\r\nJapanese stocking pattern; an amoeba; an embryo cuttlefish; a plan of\r\nBoston, and other forms equally divergent. Mr. Fison, in his book above\r\nquoted, writes as follows of other astronomical subjects: \"Drawings of\r\nthe Milky Way as seen by the naked eye have been recently executed by\r\ntwo independent observers, Mr. Boeddicker and Mr. Eaton, each drawing\r\nthe result of long and arduous observation, but in comparing them it\r\nis the exception rather than the rule to find any approximation in\r\nagreement in respect of the more delicate details.\" The drawings of\r\nthe surface features of Mars by different observers do vary in respect\r\nof the more delicate details, but in every case they represent a map\r\nof some kind and do not remind one of a wheelbarrow, baptismal font,\r\nor other incongruous objects. These divergent drawings of the same\r\nobject are not confined to celestial bodies. One has only to examine\r\nworks on ancient Mexican and Egyptian monuments, or those of classical\r\narchæology, to see the astounding caricatures and perversions. The\r\nvarious drawings of the famous Dighton Rock inscription, covering a\r\nperiod of two hundred years, are striking examples of the vagaries of\r\nan artist. Moreover, the text accompanying the drawings often states\r\nthat they were drawn with scrupulous care. The hieroglyphics are\r\npecked out on the face of a rock in rough lines, half an inch wide and\r\na third of an inch in depth. These marks are in enduring rock; it is\r\nthe observer and his imperfect drawing which is at fault. The Nebula\r\nof Orion, the Milky Way, and, for the time being, the Solar Corona\r\nare permanent objective realities and have all been photographed, yet\r\nbehold the drawings! It is unnecessary to state that the ability to\r\ndraw varies quite as much with man as the ability to sing. A man may\r\nbe an excellent observer and yet utterly unable to use a pencil, and\r\nany attempt on the part of one to draw who has no ability in that\r\ndirection results in a fiasco. It is noteworthy that an artist with no\r\nknowledge of astronomy, or the art of telescopic observation, will make\r\na more accurate drawing than one made by the best astronomer who has no\r\nability as a draughtsman. Concerning the drawings of Mars, if one will\r\nturn to the \"Annals of the Lowell Observatory,\" Volume I, Plate XIV, he\r\nwill there see drawings made on successive nights by Mr. Lowell and his\r\nassistants, Mr. Douglass and Mr. Drew, showing a remarkable agreement.\r\nAfter finishing my observations of Mars, which covered nearly a\r\ncomplete presentation of the planet, I made a comparison between my\r\ndrawings and those made by Professor Lowell and his secretary, Miss\r\nLeonard, and a few made by the assistant astronomers, Mr. Lampland and\r\nMr. Slipher, and the agreement was almost absolute, the only difference\r\nbeing that their drawings portrayed additional features which in\r\nsome cases I had caught a glimpse of but could not fix. I found it\r\nexceedingly difficult to draw in the correct positions details within a\r\ncircle, and particularly when the axis of that circle was inclined some\r\ndegrees from the vertical, indicated by a spider's thread in the ocular.\r\n\r\nI think any reasonable man will admit that the divergence seen in the\r\nvarious drawings of Mars by different observers cannot be held as an\r\nargument against their existence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nTHEORIES REGARDING THE CANALS\r\n\r\n        _In knowledge, that man only is to be condemned and\r\n        despised who is not in a state of transition._\r\n\r\n                FARADAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving shown to the satisfaction of any reasonable mind that the\r\ndelicate lines, known as canals, do exist, it will be interesting\r\nto examine some of the theories which have been advanced to explain\r\nthese markings, as well as some of the absurd deductions drawn from\r\ntheir existence. The late Dr. J. Joly, Professor of Geology in the\r\nUniversity of Dublin, in a paper on the Origin of the Canals of Mars\r\n(\"Trans.\" Royal Soc., Dublin) came to the conclusion that meteoric\r\nbodies, revolving on or near the surface of Mars, produced these lines.\r\nIn brief, he supposed that Mars at various times in the early stages\r\nof his history, when his rotation period was much shorter, attracted\r\nsmall bodies, which, after whirling about the planet, finally came\r\ndown on the crust and caused these lines. He conceived of satellites\r\ntwice the diameter of Phobos, or say, seventy-two miles in diameter,\r\nflying about Mars at a distance of sixty-three miles, which would at\r\nthis distance, by its attractive force, exert a stress on the supposed\r\nthin crust of Mars of from fifteen to thirty tons per square foot, and\r\nthus rend the surface of the planet in a zone two hundred and twenty\r\nmiles wide, thus forming two parallel ridges which might be visible to\r\nus as double canals. This preposterous idea takes no account of the\r\ngreater attractive force of the Earth, and that it too should have\r\nhad precisely the same experience, more often repeated. No trace of\r\nsuch behaviors, however, has ever been detected. The Moon, too, should\r\nhave caught some of these heavy bodies, but while conspicuous cracks\r\nare seen on her surface, and delicate ridges are seen radiating from\r\nthe larger volcanoes, not a trace of these great meteoric furrows\r\nhas ever been observed. It takes no account of the chances--one in a\r\nmillion--that these cavorting meteors should meet at common centres,\r\nand if they did, the impossibility that they should stop abruptly and\r\nthen start off in opposite directions. It takes no account of many\r\nof the lines following the arc of a great circle, or what finally\r\nbecame of three or four hundred of these meteors to tally with the\r\nnumber of the canals, unless it is supposed that some of them went\r\nwhirling around the planet three or four times, changing their courses\r\ninstantly and repeatedly. Indeed, the advancement of such absurd ideas\r\nshows the desperate despair of a man who tries to escape the admission\r\nthat the lines in question may be artificial--and hence the result of\r\nintelligence working to a definite end--by a conception as crazy as one\r\nmight possibly get in a disordered dream. To heighten the absurdity\r\nof this theory, if that were possible, Mr. J. L. E. Dryer, who signs\r\na notice of this paper, while calling attention to the fact that this\r\nhypothesis takes no account of the correlation of changes in the canals\r\nwith seasonal changes on the planet, otherwise soberly says: \"It must\r\nbe conceded that there is nothing in the new hypothesis contrary to\r\nobserved facts.\"\r\n\r\nMr. J. Orr, in the pages of the \"British Astronomical Journal,\"\r\nassuming that Schiaparelli believed that the canals were excavated\r\n(despite the fact that Schiaparelli called them _canali_, or\r\nchannels), and compared them to the English Channel and the Channel of\r\nMozambique--for at the outset he had no doubt of their being natural\r\nconfigurations--proceeds to show the impossibility of an idea that\r\nwas never entertained. His attempt is as childish and ridiculous as\r\nthe theory he conjures up. Mr. Orr, taking it for granted that the\r\nonly explanation offered for these lines is that they are excavated,\r\nconcludes that a Martian canal, like Tartarus, \"should be seventy\r\nfeet in depth (one might ask, why not five hundred or five thousand?)\r\nand that the canals of Mars would contain 1,634,000 of our Suez\r\nCanals, and would require an army of two hundred million men, working\r\nfor one thousand of our years, for their construction,\" and similar\r\nidiocies regarding the population of Mars, which he concludes \"must be\r\n409,000,000, thus showing that all the adult males, and a large number\r\nof women, must have been engaged in the great work.\" In connection\r\nwith this absurd travesty, let us pause for a moment to consider the\r\nextraordinary character of the president of this society before which\r\nthis paper was read. A man who is the senior assistant of the Royal\r\nObservatory at Greenwich, instead of rebuking this balderdash as\r\nentirely beside the question, stated as the result of an experiment\r\nwith a lot of charity-school children, that the canals are merely\r\nillusions of the brain, and this in the face of the testimony of a\r\nnumber of astronomers, many of whom are highly distinguished, that\r\nthe markings do exist. This man seriously commented on the paper by\r\nsaying: \"He hoped that Mr. Orr's statistical, but nevertheless amusing\r\nand instructive, paper might prove one more nail in the coffin of a\r\nvery absurd idea which had certainly got most undue currency, namely,\r\nthat the canals of Mars could possibly be the work of human agents.\"\r\nEqually astounding, too, is it that this nonsense the \"Astronomical\r\nJournal of the Pacific\" republishes without a word of comment. But what\r\ncould we expect of the mentality of the senior assistant of the Royal\r\nObservatory at Greenwich, who, with the great vault of heaven crowded\r\nwith enigmas awaiting an answer, should waste a particle of gray matter\r\nin trying to ascertain precisely where Joshua stood when he commanded\r\nthe Sun to stand still so that he could have a little more time for\r\nhis bloody work. Even the day of the month is ascertained; he finds\r\nthat the date of this murderous affair was about July 22, and that the\r\nSun must have risen exactly at 5 A. M. and set at 7 P. M. The Moon,\r\nhe concludes, must have been about its third quarter and was within\r\nhalf an hour of setting. He could not fix the year, however! Fancy\r\nall this detail without a word of exegetical criticism, or comment\r\non the precise words of Joshua. \"And he said in the sight of Israel,\r\nSun, stand thou still upon Gibeon; and thou, Moon, in the valley of\r\nAjalon. And the Sun stood still, and the Moon stayed, until the people\r\nhad avenged themselves upon their enemies.\" Not even a pious query\r\nas to why the Lord did not shower down a few more meteorites, rather\r\nthan disarrange the whole solar system. Such an attitude of the mind\r\nrenders one incapable of appreciating anything in astronomic research\r\nbeyond that which can be measured and photographed. The above is a fair\r\nillustration of the intolerable attitude of many of those who deny the\r\nexistence of the canals, or, if admitting them as existent, resort to\r\nevery expedient to disprove their artificial character.\r\n\r\nAmong the interesting suggestions as to the cause of the lines on Mars\r\nis that proposed by Professor W. H. Pickering, who, while admitting\r\nthat they represent bands of vegetation, believes that they have their\r\ncounterpart on the Moon, and that both are produced by volcanic forces,\r\nthe cracking of the surface being the result of internal strain and\r\nstress. The fissures thus produced permit the escape of water vapor\r\nand carbon dioxide, and thus the natural irrigation of these cracks is\r\neffected and growth of vegetation follows. This opinion should have\r\ngreat weight, as Professor Pickering has made a profound study of lunar\r\ndetails, and is one of the foremost authorities on the subject. He\r\nhas also drawn many of the surface features of Mars, and was at one\r\ntime connected with the Lowell Observatory. He it was who suggested\r\nirrigation to account for the great apparent width of the Martian\r\nlines. In the \"Annals of the Harvard College Observatory,\" Vol. LIII,\r\nNo. 14, Professor Pickering presents a study of a crater on the Moon's\r\nsurface, known as Eratosthenes, accompanied by drawings and photographs\r\nof an area within the crater revealing a few irregular cracks which he\r\nthinks correspond to the well-known canals of Mars; indeed, he calls\r\nthese lines canals though he believes them to be cracks. A few spots,\r\nprobably craterlets, he compares to the oases of Lowell. That there is\r\nno atmosphere on the Moon is admitted by all. Professor Pickering's\r\nkeen eye has, however, detected a change in the appearance of these\r\ncracks which he attributes to vegetation, animated in its growth\r\nby water vapor and carbonic acid gas, as before remarked. In this\r\nsupposition he may be right, though it seems difficult to believe that\r\nso deliquescent an organism as a plant could withstand a variation of\r\ntemperature from two to three hundred degrees below zero, to one above\r\nthat of boiling water. One might naturally ask why the greater cracks\r\nso conspicuous on the Moon's surface, typical examples of which\r\nare found in the Mare Serenitis, Mare Triangulatis, and surroundings,\r\ndo not emit aqueous vapor and carbon dioxide, and thus show similar\r\nfeatures of widening and change of shade. Admitting the correctness of\r\nPickering's views, it seems impossible to see any resemblance between\r\nthis diminutive agglomeration of lines within a lunar crater, and the\r\ngreat geodetic lines sweeping for hundreds of miles across the face of\r\nMars.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE III\r\n\r\nCHINESE BOWL, SHOWING CRACKLE]\r\n\r\nIn the lunar crater, known as Flammarion's Circle, a most typical\r\nbranching crack is seen. An examination of these lunar cracks, of which\r\nI made drawings through the great telescope at the Lowell Observatory,\r\nshowed them to be cracks of the most unmistakable character, paralleled\r\non the Earth's surface, by sunbaked fissures. If volcanic forces have\r\ncaused these cracks in the Moon the same kind of energy should have\r\nproduced the same general results in Mars, and circular craters should\r\nequally be in evidence, for many of the lunar craters are sufficiently\r\nlarge to be detected were they on Mars. They would certainly be\r\nindicated on the terminator, and yet not a trace of such markings has\r\nbeen found. It is rather extraordinary, too, that such earthquake\r\nfissures on any great scale should not have been filled with trap,\r\nsilicate, or other injected material. Indeed it is strange that such a\r\ntriangulating arrangement of cracks has not been found on the Earth's\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE IV\r\n\r\nMUD CRACKS ON SHORE OF ROGER'S LAKE, ARIZONA]\r\n\r\nIn order to pronounce the lines on Mars as simply cracks one should\r\nstudy the various kinds of cracks in similar surfaces on the Earth.\r\nIn such a study he would be amazed at the similarity of cracks. When\r\nthere is a grain in the substance, as in wood, the cracks follow\r\nthe grain, though even in this material they are discontinuous. In\r\namorphous material they have essentially the same character; whether in\r\nthe almost microscopic crackle of old Satsuma pottery, or huge cracks\r\nin sun-dried mud, the areas enclosed are generally polygonal. If the\r\nmaterial be of impalpable fineness the edges of the cracks are smooth\r\nand clean-cut, as in Plate III, from a Chinese bowl; whereas if the\r\nmaterial is coarse and pebbly the edges of the cracks are rough and\r\nirregular, as in Plate IV, from the muddy shores of a lake. Cracks\r\narising from contraction never converge to a common centre, and when\r\nnot connected with another crack they taper to a point. They begin at\r\nindefinite places and end in an equally indefinite manner. That there\r\nshould be a common resemblance in cracks due to contraction is\r\nevident as they arise from a shrinking of the surface. The most ancient\r\ndeposits, millions of ages ago, reveal mud cracks differing in no\r\nrespect from those found to-day. We subjoin a few forms of cracks from\r\nvarious surfaces, to show their essential resemblance. It will be seen\r\nthat the cracks in the Moon are identical in character to those found\r\non the Mesa at Flagstaff. They start from some indefinite point, are\r\nirregular in outline and end as indefinitely. A poor asphalt pavement\r\noffers one of the best opportunities for the study of the formation of\r\nvarious kinds of cracks and fissures. On the edge of a sloping sidewalk\r\none may see the cracks due to a sliding, or lateral displacement of the\r\nsurface; the effects of subsidence show a number of cracks around the\r\narea of depression; the growth of a tree crowding the asphalt shows\r\nthe effect of lateral thrust, and an enlargement of a root below, or\r\nthe effects of frost show cracks due to elevation. All these various\r\ncracks reveal the same features: they are discontinuous, they begin and\r\nend without definition. Schiaparelli says in regard to the _canali_ of\r\nMars: \"None of them have yet been seen cut off in the middle of the\r\ncontinent, remaining without beginning or without end.\" These lines on\r\nthe surface of Mars, as a writer in \"Nature\" says, are almost without\r\nexception geodetically straight, supernaturally so, and this in spite\r\nof their leading in every possible direction. It is inconceivable that\r\ncracks should be laid out with such geodetic precision. We have seen\r\nthat cracks have no definite beginning or termination; we have seen\r\nthat the lines of Mars begin and end at definite places. Cracks are\r\nirregular, vary in width and differ entirely from the straight lines\r\ndepicted by Schiaparelli, Lowell, and others. But if we admit them\r\nto be natural cracks in the crust we are compelled to admit that the\r\nforces implicated in such cracks must have been active many millions\r\nof years ago, as Mars, being a much older planet than the Earth, must\r\nhave long since ceased to show those activities which the Earth,\r\neven to-day, exhibits in such phenomena as earthquakes, subsidences,\r\nelevations, and the like. Now cracks made at that early time in the\r\nhistory of the planet must have long since become filled with detritus\r\nand obliterated in other ways, and no evidence would show, even on\r\nclose inspection, of their former existence, much less at a distance of\r\n50,000,000 of miles, more or less.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE V\r\n\r\n  1.

No. 1 represents the cracks in the glaze of Japanese\r\npottery, magnified. No. 2 shows the mud cracks on the edge of a lake,\r\nto the extent of two feet. No. 3 is a series of cracks in an asphalt\r\npavement, covering about two feet. No. 4 shows the form of cracks\r\nin the surface of a mesa in Arizona, the result of the summer heat,\r\nthe length being about ten feet. No. 5 is a tracing from a drawing\r\nby Professor W. H. Pickering showing cracks in the lunar crater\r\nEratosthenes, with an extent of fifty-five miles. The original drawing\r\nrepresented a much greater widening of the lines which Professor\r\nPickering believes to be due to vegetation. I endeavored to trace\r\nthe centre of each line and Professor Pickering said in regard to my\r\ntracing: \"In one or two instances you have assumed that a crack went\r\nthrough the middle of a broad space, whereas, for aught we know, it\r\nmay have gone along either edge, but otherwise the tracing obviously\r\nfollows the outlines of my drawing.\" It evidently gives a _cachet_\r\nof what appears to be veritable cracks on the surface, and it is\r\ninteresting to compare this drawing with the cracks in the asphalt. In\r\nNo. 6 are two drawings; one marked A represents cracks in a region of\r\nthe Moon known as Flammarion's Circle, the other B represents the great\r\nrift in southern Africa, probably the most stupendous phenomenon in\r\ngeological history. This rift has been traced from the Valley of the\r\nJordan through the Dead Sea, into the Gulf of Akaba, thence into the\r\nRed Sea, which it follows the entire length, then turning southwesterly\r\ninto Africa and branching, one branch takes in Lake Tanganyika, and\r\nthe other branch Lake Nyassa. A portion north of Nyassa is still\r\nproblematical. Here is a crack 1,500 miles long, most of it filled with\r\ndetritus, water, or forest. It would be an interesting question whether\r\nsuch a fracture would be visible even from the Moon. A glance at these\r\nvarious figures will give one a conception of the similarity of cracks,\r\ntheir irregular contour, their indeterminate origin, and ending. Cracks\r\narising from shrinkage vary only in the material in which the crack\r\ntakes place; the conditions resulting from shrinkage or pulling apart\r\nare precisely the same.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VI\r\n\r\n  1.

They are all\r\ndesigned for channels or thoroughfares for the transportation of men,\r\nmerchandise, or water. No. 1 represents a tracing from a railroad map\r\nof a county in Illinois. The convergence of lines to common centres,\r\nand, in one case, parallel lines may be seen. The length of the region\r\nrepresented is thirty-seven miles. No. 2 is a tracing of streets\r\nin a district of Montreal, covering an extent of half a mile. No. 3 is\r\na tracing of a small region near Phoenix, Arizona, showing irrigating\r\ncanals. The larger ones follow contour lines of the surface; the\r\nsmaller ones are usually laid out in rectangular form to correspond\r\nwith the original land sections and sub-sections, the boundary lines\r\nof which run north and south, east and west. No. 4 represents the\r\ncanals converging on Groningen, Holland. No. 5 is a tracing from a\r\nhemispherical map of Mars made by Schiaparelli, and No 6 is traced\r\nfrom a photograph of a globe on which Lowell has carefully drawn the\r\ncanals, oases, etc., of Mars covering a land extent of 7,400 miles. The\r\nremarkable artificiality of all these figures must be admitted. The\r\nlines on the first four figures are laid out by an intelligence for\r\nsimilar purposes. No. 1 for the conveyance of passengers and freight;\r\nNo. 2 for the traffic of a city; No. 3 for the conveyance of water; No.\r\n4 for purposes of navigation, and Nos. 5 and 6, according to Lowell's\r\nview, for the conveyance of water from melting polar snow caps for\r\nirrigation purposes. A simple, rational explanation, as their great\r\nwidth and geodetic precision forbid any other.\r\n\r\nLet one contemplate these lines of Mars and compare them with the\r\nnatural cracks on Plate V and he will appreciate the emphatic words of\r\nLowell when he says: \"The mere aspect is enough to cause all theories\r\nabout glaciation, fissures, or surface cracks to die an instant and\r\nnatural death.\" Consider any other possible tracing of lines on the\r\nface of the Earth as the result of Nature's forces, such as river beds,\r\ncañons, chasms, fissures, faults, rifts, precipitous valleys, fiords,\r\nthe results of sharp folds in the strata, parallel chains of mountains,\r\nand none of these lines would be straight, none of them would be of\r\nuniform width, and few of them would have the enormous breadth of the\r\nMartian lines, they would begin nowhere and, with the exception of\r\nthe rivers, end nowhere. This definition holds good as the result of\r\nnatural forces from the microscopic crackle on a dinner plate, to a\r\ncrack in the Earth's crust fifteen hundred miles long.\r\n\r\nHaving briefly alluded to some of the theories advanced to explain the\r\ngeodetic network of lines encircling Mars--theories in one case so\r\npuerile, and in another case an interpretation so monstrous, though\r\nendorsed by astronomers of standing--we turn to the suggestion that\r\nthese various lines are artificial, that they were designed for a\r\ndefinite purpose, namely, to conduct water from those regions alone\r\nwhere water is found for the purposes of irrigation. We shall call\r\nattention to a parallel case where the great ice caps and glaciers of\r\nthe Himalaya Mountains supply water, by their melting, for thousands of\r\nmiles of irrigating canals. Let us ask ourselves whether if the snows\r\nof the Himalayas gradually failed, the crowded millions of India would\r\nnot if necessary reach out to the farthest North for this precious\r\nfluid? Our great centres of population at the present time are reaching\r\nout in every direction for water supply. How long would it take New\r\nYork City to decide in case of water famine to tap the Great Lakes to\r\nthe north, or to establish pipe lines to the north pole, if it were\r\nnecessary to go that distance for water?\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing it is seen that the question of water supply has\r\nengaged the energies of man from pre-historic times. These great\r\nirrigating works are found, however, in regions of sterility, or light\r\nrainfall, from the rude irrigating canals of ancient Peru and Arizona\r\nto the marvellous accomplishments of the hydraulic engineer in India\r\nand Egypt. This demand for more water is not, however, confined to\r\nregions of sterility, the reaching out of cities for supplies of water\r\nfor potable purposes and for the wasteful disposal of sewage was\r\ninevitable. What shall we say, however, of the notes of warning in\r\nregions of rain?\r\n\r\nEngland is considered a land of humidity and copious rains, and yet the\r\nalarm is already sounded that in the no distant future an appalling\r\ncatastrophe may threaten her in the failure of her water supply. In a\r\nspecial despatch to the \"New York Herald,\" Mr. Bently, president of\r\nthe Royal Meteorological Society, is quoted as saying at its Annual\r\nMeeting, \"So enormous now is the drain upon the country's available\r\nsupplies, so much have the growth of cities, the disappearance of\r\nforested areas, the extent of street surface impervious to moisture,\r\nand the diversion of the rivers, lakes, and other natural fresh water\r\nreservoirs from their natural function of irrigators and distributors\r\nof the all essential moisture to the land interfered in England with\r\nnature's arrangements, that English engineers and meteorologists at no\r\ndistant date may find a task of almost insuperable difficulty awaiting\r\ntheir endeavors.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Mill, a rainfall expert, on being consulted by a \"Daily Mail\"\r\ncorrespondent regarding this alarming statement, was of the opinion\r\nthat the question would require early consideration. We quote his words\r\nas follows: \"Legislation is needed in the immediate future for the\r\nregulation of the rivers. The great question is how to store the water\r\nwhich at present runs to waste on the coasts.\"\r\n\r\n\"The planting of trees on the high water-sheds is one of the first\r\nsolutions of the problem. The chief difficulty lies in the scarcity\r\nof suitable land available for building large reservoirs, and at some\r\nfuture date the services of engineers will be required to reform the\r\npresent arrangement of reservoirs.\"\r\n\r\n\"In Austria the government issues an annual report on the condition\r\nof the Danube and detailed statistics of the rainfall, with a view\r\nto storing all the available water supplies. The work done by the\r\nAustrian government I am doing in regard to the British Isles on my own\r\nresponsibility, but the rainfall and the river conditions are only a\r\nportion of a much larger problem.\"\r\n\r\nThe above quotations indicate that even now an alarm is felt in\r\ncountries of fair rainfall regarding the possible failure of the water\r\nsupply in the near future and is perhaps a premonition as to what may\r\nbe absorbing our energies in centuries to come. Such possibilities as\r\nhere suggested may offer an additional clew to an interpretation of the\r\nMartian markings.\r\n\r\nThe unnatural straightness of these interlacing lines on Mars,\r\nmany of them following the arcs of great circles, their uniform\r\nwidth throughout, their always starting from definite areas,\r\ntheir convergence to common centres, and their varying visibility\r\nsynchronizing with the Martian seasons finds no parallel in natural\r\nphenomena.\r\n\r\nIf in the mind's eye we were to survey the Earth from Mars the only\r\nfeature we should find at all paralleling the lines in Mars would be\r\nfound in the level regions of the West, where, for thousands of miles,\r\nthe land extends in vast level stretches. In these regions would be\r\nfound lines of railroads running in straight courses, starting from\r\ndefinite places, converging to common centres, their sides, in certain\r\nseasons, conspicuous with ripening grain fields, or again the work of\r\nthe United States Reclamation Bureau running its irrigating canals in\r\nvarious directions through that great region. Both these kinds of lines\r\nwould be artificial and both designed for purposes of conveyance--in\r\nthe one case, merchandise and passengers, in the other case, water.\r\n\r\nIf the Martian lines are not artificial some other theories must be\r\noffered than those thus far advanced to explain their origin and\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nThe phenomenon of the extraordinary doubling of the canals when first\r\nannounced was immediately disbelieved; when, however, other observers\r\nconfirmed Schiaparelli's discoveries, and it became evident that these\r\ndouble lines had a veritable existence, the phenomenon was regarded as\r\nan evidence that profound physical changes were going on in the planet.\r\nThus in 1887 Mr. Stanislaus Maunier, in \"La Nature,\"[6] in alluding to\r\nthe remarkable discovery of the doubling of the canals, says: \"Mars at\r\nthis moment is the theatre of phenomena of stupendous grandeur which\r\nwill be adequate in a few years to impress profound changes in its\r\naspect.\" This was written in 1887, and continuous observations of the\r\nplanet since that time have shown no profound changes, or changes of\r\nany kind beyond those which periodically occur with the seasons. Since\r\nMars is a much older planet than the Earth, it seems reasonable to\r\nbelieve that it is more stable, that volcanoes and earthquakes have\r\nlong ceased to manifest their activities, that erosive action by water\r\nis no longer in evidence, subsidence and elevation of continental areas\r\nno longer occur. From this condition of the planet it is impossible to\r\nbelieve that the curious phenomenon of the doubling or gemination of\r\nthe canals can be due to any physical changes now taking place.\r\n\r\nSchiaparelli said that many of the ingenious suppositions advanced to\r\naccount for this doubling of the canals would not have been proposed\r\nhad their authors been able to examine the gemination with their own\r\neyes; he further says: \"It is far easier to explain the gemination if\r\nwe are willing to introduce the forces pertaining to organic nature;\r\nhere the field of plausible supposition is immense,\" and in this field\r\nof suppositions he suggests \"changes of vegetation over vast areas.\"\r\nLet any intelligent mind soberly consider this rational suggestion\r\nof Schiaparelli's and compare it with other theories that have been\r\nadvanced, and he will be compelled to admit that vegetation alone gives\r\nus at least a clew to the extraordinary behavior of these parallel\r\nlines. To understand the symmetry, the suddenness, and the vast extent\r\nof this phenomenon, the further explanation of vegetation superinduced\r\nby artificial methods will alone complete the answer.\r\n\r\nSir Robert Ball cannot conceive how Mars, a much older planet, should\r\ndevelop synchronously with the Earth creatures of intelligence, an\r\nevent which he insists should have occurred ages earlier in its\r\nhistory. In this supposition he is quite right, for if there are\r\ncreatures of intelligence in Mars these should have appeared much\r\nearlier, and that is probably what has happened. The problem is one\r\nparallel to that urged by Sir Boyd Dawkins in regard to the evidences\r\nof man in the Tertiary rocks. Dawkins argued that since the mammals in\r\nthe Tertiary had changed so profoundly, many types becoming extinct,\r\nif man had lived at that time he also should have been affected by\r\nthe same influences, and should have changed accordingly. It has been\r\nclearly pointed out by Cope and others that the moment intelligence\r\nbecame a factor in natural selection it was seized upon to the relative\r\nexclusion of physical characteristics, hence but little change,\r\notherwise than an intellectual one, has taken place in man since his\r\nprogenitors took to the trees and made up by agility, cunning, and\r\nalertness what they lacked in physical strength. In the same way,\r\nif, in the past history of Mars, an intelligent creature appeared he\r\nmust have survived under precisely similar conditions, and long after\r\nfavorable environments had passed that were implicated in making him\r\nwhat he was.\r\n\r\nAdmitting that there is an intelligent creature of some kind in Mars,\r\nis it reasonably conceivable that he should have caused such changes\r\nin the surface features of that planet as to be visible from the\r\nEarth? Professor Newcomb concludes, in a recent article in \"Harper's\r\nMagazine,\" that \"we cannot expect to see any signs of the works of\r\ninhabitants in Mars, if such exist.\" Let us, however, reverse the\r\nproposition and ask ourselves if man has been implicated in any changes\r\nin the surface appearance of the Earth that would be visible from\r\nMars? And I think the question can be answered in only one way. The\r\nvast cities such as Pekin, Tokio, London, and New York, with their\r\ngreat expanse of tiled and slated roofs, and sterile streets, would\r\ncertainly have a different albedo from the grass and trees in the\r\nimmediate outskirts of such places. The tracts of land reclaimed from\r\nthe sea, and still more the enormous areas which have been rendered\r\ngreen by irrigation, must, of all contrasts, be markedly conspicuous.\r\nTo realize the extent of this work, it is only necessary to state that\r\nin Egypt 6,000,000 acres depend upon irrigation, and this area to be\r\nvastly increased in a short time; the Western states of America with\r\n10,000,000 acres, and this area being rapidly augmented by the work\r\nof the United States Reclamation Bureau; in India 25,000,000 acres\r\nunder irrigation, and this being continually added to; above all,\r\nhowever, the vast extent of territory from which the dark forests have\r\nbeen removed in this country, and more particularly in China, must\r\nmake a visible landmark. If one can recall the appearance of forests\r\nin the southern and middle part of Maine, say from Bethel or Bangor,\r\nfifty years ago, he will remember that from the top of any hill a\r\nstretch of dark blue forest was to be seen as far as the eye could\r\nreach, and now from the same elevations one can see only an occasional\r\nclump of blue forest, while the remaining surface is, according to\r\nthe season, either bright green, yellow with ripening vegetation, or\r\nwhite with snow, out of which the dark clumps of forest growth are most\r\nconspicuous. Considering the contrasting colors in one year covering\r\nhundreds of thousands of square miles in various portions of the\r\ncountry, the question naturally arises which of these contrasts would\r\nbe most conspicuous,--the colors just mentioned of solid land surfaces\r\nof vegetation, snow, and desert, or diaphanous clouds with their gray\r\nshadows. We are told that Jupiter, with the mean distance at opposition\r\nof nearly 400,000,000 miles, shows its clouds, its red spot, and the\r\nshadow transits of its satellites. Surely if these conditions are seen\r\nfrom the Earth, the changes in the Earth's appearance above described\r\nmight be seen from Mars, which at its nearest opposition is only\r\n35,000,000 miles away, and, conversely, any change of similar character\r\nin Mars would certainly be visible from the Earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nCOMMENTS AND CRITICISM\r\n\r\n        _Nothing is more difficult and requires more caution than\r\n        philosophical deduction, nor is there anything more adverse\r\n        to its accuracy than fixity of opinion._\r\n\r\n                FARADAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will be of interest to examine the writings of certain astronomers,\r\nand writers on astronomy, to appreciate the unreasonable conservatism,\r\nnot to say narrow-mindedness, which color their opinions. It ill\r\nbecomes students of science to ridicule the honest and persistent\r\nlabors of such men as Schiaparelli, Lowell, Perrotin, and others,\r\nunless they can show an equal devotion to the work. They do not recall\r\nthe deluge of essays, reviews, and sober treatises which followed\r\nDarwin's great work, viewing the evidences of Darwin not thoughtfully,\r\nnor based upon any knowledge of the subject, but with contempt, and,\r\nin many instances, with vituperation. So rapid, however, was the\r\nrecognition of Darwin's interpretation of Nature's facts that most\r\nof these writers lived long enough to see their protests entirely\r\ndiscredited, or to become enthusiastic advocates of the theory.\r\n\r\nIn their own domain of astronomy these writers are equally forgetful of\r\nthe earnest and even bitter controversies regarding the demonstration\r\nby Chandler of the oscillation of the poles, and consequent variation\r\nof latitude, and the final establishment of Chandler's views, in the\r\nteeth of opposition, by the greatest astronomers.\r\n\r\nThe character of this irrelevant and adverse criticism may be\r\nappreciated by subjoining a few examples. The most amazing of all these\r\nexpressions is to be found in the report of the British Astronomical\r\nAssociation, for 1892. It seems that a committee had been appointed by\r\nthe Association to report on the surface features of Mars. E. Walter\r\nMaunder was made Director of the Committee. Twenty-six observers,\r\nof whom twenty-one were inhabitants of Great Britain, sent in the\r\nresult of their work accompanied by drawings. A summary of this work\r\nwas published in the form of memoranda accompanied by a Mercator\r\nprojection map of Mars, individual planisphere drawings, as well as\r\ncolored plates; these together represented twenty-eight single canals,\r\nfive double canals, nine oases, as well as the dark regions so long\r\nfamiliar to astronomers. This was a somewhat remarkable contribution\r\nconsidering the complaints from the different observers in regard to\r\nthe weather, and the prejudiced, and negligent part played by the man\r\nat the helm. That I am not unjust in these statements may be understood\r\nby quoting from the report showing the conditions under which the\r\nEnglish observers labored, the delinquent part which Mr. Maunder,\r\nthe Director, played in the matter, and the conclusions which Mr.\r\nMaunder arrived at after this unsatisfactory performance. He says:\r\n\"The opposition of 1892 proved on the whole a very disappointing one.\r\nAlthough Mars at opposition was almost at its nearest approach to the\r\nEarth, it was far from being well placed for observation by European\r\nastronomers owing to its great southerly declination, and consequent\r\nlow altitude.[7] The weather during the autumn of 1892 was for the most\r\npart very unfavorable for observation of so difficult an object, and\r\nseveral members who joined the section at the beginning were unable to\r\ncontribute either drawings or report.\"\r\n\r\nNow I beg the reader to carefully note the part the Director played\r\nin this important work. Here are his words; there is no need of\r\nitalicizing them. \"None of the few evenings which the Director was able\r\nto give to the examination of the planet was really suitable for the\r\npurpose, and as the pressure of other duties rendered it impossible\r\nfor him to supply any detailed help to the members, the section was\r\nat a very serious disadvantage.\" He certainly is frank enough to\r\nstate the disadvantages the section was under with such a man at the\r\nhead. Realizing the conditions of seeing in the fog and soot-begrimed\r\natmosphere of England, the low altitude of Mars, and the loss to\r\nthe committee of the assistance which a Director might have given\r\nto the work had he been able to approach the subject in a broad and\r\nunprejudiced manner, one is naturally led to ask what this committee\r\nwould have accomplished if each member in turn had had an opportunity\r\nof observing Mars at a high altitude with a twenty-four inch refractor\r\nof remarkable definition, at an elevation of 7,000 feet above the\r\nsea-level, in an atmosphere so clear and steady that stars of the third\r\nand fourth magnitude may be seen to set at the horizon line.\r\n\r\nMr. Maunder in speaking of the nomenclature used in his report says,\r\n\"The term 'canal' has also been retained, though 'canals' in the sense\r\nof being artificial productions, the markings of Mars which bear that\r\nname, are certainly not. It is difficult, indeed, to understand how\r\nso preposterous an idea obtained currency for a moment even by the\r\nmost ignorant.\" It is impossible to repress one's amazement at these\r\nexpressions after the confessions he makes as to his official functions\r\non the committee, and I appeal to any honest and unprejudiced mind if\r\na more incompetent person of the class to which he belongs could have\r\nbeen found in England for the Directorship of such a body. In this\r\nconnection we cannot refrain from giving a few paragraphs from a paper\r\nentitled \"Can Organic Life Exist in the Planetary System?\" by C. A.\r\nStetefeldt. The author says: \"We must, however, acknowledge that if\r\nother suns in the universe have planets--and there is no reason why\r\nthey should not--many of them may present physical conditions identical\r\nwith, or similar to, those existing on the Earth, and that therefore\r\ntheir organic life may be similar to our own. Further, I am far from\r\ndenying that, under favorable circumstances, creatures may be evolved\r\nupon planets which revolve around other suns, whose mental capacity is\r\nas much superior to man's as that of the latter is to the lowest form\r\nof vertebrates.\" Having made these liberal admissions in regard to the\r\nuniverse at large he attempts to show that none of the planets outside\r\nthe Earth could sustain life, and finally closes in this extraordinary\r\nmanner: \"In concluding this investigation we cannot help admiring the\r\ninductive acumen of the theologians who considered the Earth the most\r\nimportant of the planets, and the centre of creation. Although their\r\nopinions were not based upon scientific facts, they _arrived at the\r\ntruth nevertheless_.\" (Italics ours.) Familiar as every one is with\r\nthe attitude of theologians for the last several centuries concerning\r\nastronomical discovery I think it may be safely said that this is\r\nthe first instance on record where they have been credited with an\r\ninduction not based on observed facts worth quoting in an astronomical\r\npaper. And this contribution also appeared in the publications of the\r\n\"Astronomical Society of the Pacific,\" Volume VI, No. 25, without a\r\nword of comment! How different was the behavior of the \"Journal\" when\r\na report of Percival Lowell's lecture on Mars, written by Dr. Edward\r\nEverett Hale, was reproduced in its pages. The following comments were\r\nmade by Edward S. Holden, then Director of the Lick Observatory:\r\n\"Something is seen, no doubt, but I may add that nothing has been\r\nobserved at the Lick Observatory during the years 1888-1895, so far\r\nas I know, which goes to confirm the very striking conclusions here\r\ndescribed.\" It may be added that during the years 1888-1892 nothing was\r\nseen of the fifth moon of Jupiter. The discovery of this satellite with\r\nthe Lick telescope was not due to any special efforts on the part of\r\nthe Director.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. E. Ledger, \"Nineteenth Century Magazine,\" Volume LIII, 1903,\r\np. 773, in an article entitled \"The Canals of Mars--Are they Real?\"\r\npresents an excellent account of the successive observers of Mars,\r\nand the results of their work, and the objections of those who could\r\nnot see the canals, or saw them imperfectly. He recalls Maunder's\r\nchildish experiments, and is greatly impressed by them. He then\r\nsays: \"Astronomers are no doubt very well acquainted with the laws\r\nof optics as applied to the eye. They have made, and may yet make,\r\nmany experiments connected with their action. They are accustomed to\r\nallow for individual peculiarities in observation, as, for instance,\r\nwhen what is termed personal equation affects the rapidity with which\r\ndifferent observers touch a key to record what they see. They may\r\ntherefore skilfully judge of the effect produced in observations of\r\nMars by such processes of the eye, or of the brain, or nervous system\r\nas I have referred to.\" He strongly thinks it would be well \"if some\r\nskilful nerve specialist and oculist could work in conjunction with\r\nsome of these practised observers who have seen the canals. They might\r\nboth assist in observing, and at the same time carry out careful\r\nresearches into the optical delusions which brain or eye may experience\r\nin connection with telescopic observation.\" This is certainly a happy\r\nthought of the reverend author, only it would seem in this case that a\r\nlarger and more diversified corps of specialists, including alienists,\r\nis needed to attend to that class of astronomers who are suffering with\r\nmental strabismus. It might be advisable to call in the services of\r\na bacteriologist to make cultures of new forms of microbes which may\r\nbe involved in rendering a man incapable of estimating the value of\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\nIt is the exception rather than the rule in astronomical science that\r\none finds such unfounded and prejudiced utterances as those above\r\ncommented upon. The glamour of astrology still lingers, in the public\r\neye in its respect and awe for the astronomer's work. Every eclipse\r\nseems in the nature of a prophecy. The public contributes liberally\r\nfor the support of eclipse expeditions, observatories, and the like,\r\nand these contributions would be still more liberal if the public\r\ncould realize the profound significance of the researches now being\r\ncarried on by Director Pickering at Harvard, Director Campbell at Lick,\r\nDirector Hale at the Solar Observatory, Mount Wilson, and many others.\r\nTheir observations are received without question. The thoughtful\r\nman would only ask that like credence should be given to the work\r\nof every earnest student unless disproved, even though the field of\r\ninvestigation covers regions hitherto but little explored, and yet of\r\nthe very greatest interest to the human race.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nATMOSPHERE AND MOISTURE\r\n\r\n        _If in any planet we could detect the traces of vegetable\r\n        life it would at once be a strong argument for the\r\n        existence of animals there and vice versa._\r\n\r\n                HENRY DRAPER.\r\n\r\n\r\nSchiaparelli points out that \"the polar snows of Mars prove in an\r\nincontrovertible manner that the planet, like the Earth, is surrounded\r\nby an atmosphere capable of transporting vapor from one place to\r\nanother.\" Mr. E. E. Barnard, in the \"Astrophysical Journal,\" Volume\r\nXVII, No. 4, in speaking of the polar caps, says: \"There seems no\r\ndefinite proof that they are not as much ice and snow as that which we\r\nhave to deal with in our own terrestrial winters. So much is at least\r\nsuggested by the great seasonal changes they undergo from winter to\r\nsummer. There seems to be a general belief now that Mars certainly has\r\nan atmosphere. This atmosphere seems to be very much less than our own,\r\nand yet it is of sufficient density to produce the phenomena of the\r\npolar caps by condensation and evaporation and also to produce, though\r\nrarely, some form of clouds.\"\r\n\r\nAmong those who have claimed to have established the existence of water\r\nvapor in Mars by the spectroscope are Rutherford, Secchi, Huggins,\r\nJanssen, and Vogel; and these declare the existence of a Martian\r\natmosphere similar to our own in composition. Mr. Campbell can find no\r\nspectroscopic indication of an atmosphere charged with water vapor.\r\nLewis E. Jewell says: \"The spectroscopic proof of the presence of a\r\nfair amount of water in the atmosphere of Mars must be regarded as\r\nunattainable.\" Professor Lowell, despite the aid the admission of\r\nwater vapor in Mars would give to his position, also doubts whether\r\nthe spectroscope is able to detect the evidence through our own\r\nmoisture-laden atmosphere.\r\n\r\nAfter a minute and exhaustive study of the polar snow caps by the\r\ncombined observations of Lowell, Douglass and W. H. Pickering, Mr.\r\nLowell says: \"It is interesting that the cap should so simply tell us\r\nof these three important things: the presence of air, the presence of\r\nwater, and the presence of a temperature, not incomparable with that of\r\nthe Earth.\"\r\n\r\nSeasonal changes on Mars have long been recognized and admitted\r\nby astronomers, and these changes are on so vast a scale as to be\r\ndistinctly visible from the earth. Without an atmosphere the surface\r\nof Mars would be inert. Schiaparelli was the first to notice that at\r\nsuccessive oppositions the same regions showed different degrees of\r\ndarkness and accounted for these variations by seasonal change. Mr.\r\nDenning believes that certain changes in the appearance of the markings\r\nto be due to vaporous condensations. Sir Norman Lockyer believed he\r\nsaw the obscuration of a large region by clouds, this obscuration\r\ncontinuing for some hours. A bright spot on the terminator of Mars,\r\ndiscovered by Douglass at the Lowell Observatory, and which led to the\r\nnewspaper excitement that signals were being made, was seen to move\r\nand finally disappear and its appearance, drift and disappearance is\r\ninterpreted by Lowell as a cloud illuminated by the Sun and carried\r\nalong by the wind. The presence of clouds, judging from my own brief\r\nexperience, was certainly suggested at times by the peculiar way in\r\nwhich a large region known as Syrtis Major disappeared and flashed\r\nout again. This behavior might be expected of the tenuous lines as a\r\nresult of refraction and other disturbances in our own atmosphere;\r\nwhen, however, a large, dark region at one time stands out firm,\r\nclear and sharp-cut as the stroke of a Japanese brush, then gradually\r\nfades out and remains obscure for some time we are inclined to believe\r\nthat Sir Norman Lockyer's interpretation is true and that in such a\r\ncase drifting clouds or sudden vaporous condensation produced the\r\nobscuration.\r\n\r\nFrom an article on Mars by Sir Robert Ball, republished in the\r\n\"Annual Report of the Smithsonian Institution\" for 1900, we quote\r\nthe following: \"The discussion we have just given will prepare us to\r\nbelieve that a planet with the size and mass of Mars may be expected\r\nto be encompassed with an atmosphere. Our telescopic observations\r\ncompletely bear this out. It is perfectly certain that there is a\r\ncertain shell of gaseous material investing Mars. This is shown in\r\nvarious ways. We note the gradual obscuration of objects on the planet\r\nas they approach the edge of the disk, where they are necessarily\r\nviewed through a greatly increased thickness of Martian atmosphere.\r\nWe also observe the clearness with which objects are exhibited at the\r\ncentre of the disk of Mars, and though this may be in some measure\r\ndue to the absence of distortion from the effects of foreshortening,\r\nit undoubtedly arises to some extent from the fact that objects in\r\nthis position are viewed through a comparatively small thickness of\r\nthe atmosphere enveloping the planet. Clouds are also sometimes seen\r\napparently floating in the upper region of Mars. This, of course, is\r\npossible only on the supposition that there must be an atmosphere which\r\nformed the vehicle by which clouds were borne along. It is, however,\r\nquite obvious that the extent of the Martian atmosphere must be quite\r\ninsignificant when compared with that by which our Earth is enveloped.\r\nIt is a rare circumstance for any of the main topographical features,\r\nsuch as the outlines of its so-called continents, or the coasts of\r\nits so-called seas, to be obscured by clouds to an extent which is\r\nappreciable except by very refined observations.\"\r\n\r\nProfessor W. H. Pickering made seven photographs of Mars on April 9,\r\nand within twenty-four hours made seven additional photographs of\r\nthe same region. The second series of photographs showed an area of\r\nwhite extending from the polar snow cap far down toward the equator,\r\ncovering a surface which he estimated to be as large as the United\r\nStates. It afterwards slowly disappeared. How shall we account for\r\nthis sudden apparition of a vast area of white which the photographs\r\nof twenty-four hours before did not reveal. A boy of ten, as well as\r\nthe philosopher would simply say a snow-storm had taken place in Mars.\r\nIs it, then, unreasonable to picture whirling snowflakes, snow-drifts,\r\nand dazzling whiteness from the Sun's rays, and in the rapid melting\r\nof the snow, broad rivers and turbulent brooks with water areas frozen\r\nat night? But why should we be compelled to imagine as naked the\r\nsurface through which these waters find their way? Soil there must be\r\nfrom the continual erosion of running water. The character of the rock\r\nexposures we cannot guess at, but a picture of bare rock and lifeless\r\nground is unthinkable. Such wide-spread storms without an atmosphere\r\ncould not occur. The seasonal appearance of these snows and their slow\r\ndisappearance not only indicates an atmosphere, but an atmosphere\r\ndisturbed by established currents which convey the moisture-laden air\r\nto regions of congelation.\r\n\r\nA number of observers who have detected clouds in Mars described\r\nthem as being yellowish in color. What more probable than that these\r\nyellowish masses are simply dust-storms such as one may often see\r\nwhirling along over our American deserts? When the gusts of wind\r\nare fitful like squalls at sea, the obscuration would be fitful, to\r\nclear up again. The vast areas of desert land in Mars renders this\r\nsupposition very probable.\r\n\r\nSince the above was written, my attention has been called to an\r\nearly \"Bulletin of the Lowell Observatory,\" in which Mr. Lowell,\r\nin discussing the appearance of a certain large projection on the\r\nterminator of Mars, says: \"Finally, its color leads me to believe it\r\nnot a cloud of water-vapor, but a cloud of dust. Other phenomena of the\r\nplanet bear out this supposition.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nNOTES ON IRRIGATION\r\n\r\n        _Your theory of vegetation becomes more and more probable._\r\n\r\n                SCHIAPARELLI in a letter to Lowell.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet one stand on some peak of the Verd Mountains, northeast from\r\nPhoenix, Arizona, overlooking the Gila River as it follows its course\r\nacross the desert, and after the river is lost to view he will notice\r\nthat the foliage along its banks marks its course. If one takes this\r\nview in winter time, the uniform gray of the plains, unbroken by a\r\nsingle shade of color blends with the light blue of the distant Plomas\r\nand Castle Dome Mountains on the southwest horizon. In the early spring\r\nwhen the water is first let into the irrigating channels with their\r\ninnumerable divergent ditches, a shade of green may be seen emerging\r\nfrom the monotonous yellow-gray of the hot and sterile plain, first\r\nconspicuous near the source of the water supply, and then following\r\nalong to Phoenix, Tempe, and other regions till in full efflorescence\r\nthese cities stand out like great green carpets spread upon the Earth.\r\nFrom this mountain top not a trace of an irrigating ditch, large or\r\nsmall, would be discerned, except here and there a glint of reflected\r\nsunlight, but the effects of the life-giving waters can be traced in\r\nbroad bands to the remotest limits of the water channels, when they\r\nwould end as abruptly as they had begun.\r\n\r\nIf we examine railroad maps, the lines of which represent the road-beds\r\nutilized to convey passengers and freight to various places, we shall\r\nobserve that in mountainous regions the lines run very irregularly,\r\noften paralleling mountain chains, or following rivers. On level areas\r\nsuch as Iowa, Texas, and other states, the railroads run for hundreds\r\nof miles in straight lines, at times converging towards large centres\r\nof population. Their occasional parallelism and radiation from centres,\r\nall present a certain _cachet_ in angles of approach and alignment\r\nthat reminds one strongly of similar features in the markings of\r\nMars. If each railroad were bordered by a wide growth of trees with\r\nsterile desert between, these broad bands as seen from Mars would be\r\nidentical with the appearance of similar lines in Mars as seen from\r\nthe Earth. In Mars, however, there are no high elevations since the\r\nterminator of Mars stands out clear cut and not jagged as in the Moon.\r\nThe planet being devoid of hill ranges, and large oceans, the canals\r\ncan run in straight lines for hundreds of miles. If it were possible\r\nto conceive by analogy a creature on Mars furnished with a telescope,\r\nhe would undoubtedly correlate the irrigating regions of Arizona as\r\nsimilar in nature to his own canals. The irregularity of the rivers\r\nrunning through such regions would puzzle him quite as much as we are\r\npuzzled by the absolute straightness of the Martian canals. He would,\r\nof course, observe that in our winter the irrigating areas became\r\ninvisible, to appear again as our summer advanced. His own experience\r\nof vegetation arising from irrigation alone and starting from the north\r\nwhen the first water from the melting snow cap animated the growth of\r\nplant life, and proceeding slowly towards the equator would prevent him\r\nfrom understanding the reverse condition on our planet, with the shade\r\nof green being perennial at the equator and spreading slowly north with\r\nthe advance of summer.\r\n\r\nThe marvels of irrigation are impossible to conceive of without first\r\nseeing a parched land before the water channels are dug and the\r\nexuberant vegetation springing with the water's advent. The illimitable\r\nstretches of arid plain, no green, rarely an evidence of life, and\r\nthen usually in hideous shapes like the hissing and purple-mouthed\r\nGila monster; hot pale dust; blinding sunlight; ragged clumps of gray\r\nsagebrush, rebuking by their hopeless color and dishevelled appearance,\r\nthe intolerable condition of their existence; angular cacti, surviving\r\nbecause of their vicious needles, and then literally a step only from\r\nthis sterile waste, and one finds himself wading through rich, soft\r\nalfalfa, under the deep shade of cottonwood trees, glistening threads\r\nof water when the overhanging vegetation does not hide the channels,\r\nbrilliant flowers, singing birds, fat cattle and vociferous children.\r\n\r\nIn this apparently irreclaimable desert of Arizona, have sprung up\r\nprosperous cities, great farms and fruit orchards. About Phoenix,\r\nmore than one hundred and twenty-five thousand acres are under the\r\nrichest and most profitable cultivation, and all due to a little narrow\r\ncanal which conveys the water from Salado River, and distributes it\r\nby narrow ditches, so narrow, indeed, as to be invisible except on\r\nthe nearest approach. There have already been constructed in the\r\nGila Valley alone, two hundred and fifty miles of ditches, and four\r\nhundred miles of parallels. Mr. Ray Stannard Baker, in the \"Century\"\r\nfor July, 1902, presents in a graphic way, the marvels of irrigation.\r\nMajor J. W. Powell, during the later years of his life devoted his\r\nwhole time and energy to urging the reclamation of desert lands in the\r\nWest by irrigation. In his reports on the subject he estimated that a\r\nregion equal in size to New England, New York, Pennsylvania, and West\r\nVirginia could be recovered from the desert sands of Arizona and other\r\nregions in the West. In India, millions of pounds have been spent for\r\nirrigating canals and ditches. A single canal with its tributaries\r\ndrawing water from the Ganges measures 3,910 miles in length, bringing\r\ninto cultivation one million acres of land at an expense of fifteen\r\nmillions of dollars. The idea of irrigation is not due to the advanced\r\nintellect of man; it has been the result of dire necessity and is of\r\ngreat antiquity. Mr. Frank Hamilton Cushing discovered evidences of the\r\nmost extensive irrigating canals among the ancient Pueblo Indians of\r\nArizona.\r\n\r\nSir C. Scott Moncrief, in his address as president of the engineering\r\nsection of the British Association for the Advancement of Science,\r\ndescribes the various forms of irrigation. The primitive method\r\nconsists in raising water by human labor. Early Egyptian sculpture\r\ndepicts laborers raising water by means of buckets, and along the\r\nbanks of the Nile the same method may be seen to-day. Other methods\r\nof raising water are by pumps driven by windmills. In certain regions\r\nArtesian wells furnish water for irrigation. The importance of\r\nirrigation is best shown in the fact, that, while the rainfall in\r\nCairo is, on an average, one and four tenths inches a year, yet in the\r\nimmediate neighborhood land brings $750 per acre; this value being due\r\nto irrigation alone. In speaking of water storage for supplying the\r\nirrigating canals the author says: \"When there is no moderating lake,\r\na river fed by a glacier has a precious source of supply. The hotter\r\nthe weather the more rapidly will the ice melt, and this is just when\r\nirrigation is most wanted.\" (Judging from this dictum, the condition in\r\nMars is ideal.) In speaking of the great Assouan Reservoir in Egypt, he\r\nsays: \"The sale value of land irrigated by its waters will be increased\r\nby about $125,000,000. The increase in irrigation areas in our Western\r\nStates may be appreciated by the following figures. In 1889 it amounted\r\nto 3,564,416 acres; in 1900, to 7,539,545 acres. Now it is at least\r\n10,000,000 acres. Without irrigation this land sold for four or five\r\ndollars per acre; with irrigation it brings forty dollars per acre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\nVARIETY OF CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH LIFE EXISTS\r\n\r\n        _Not only does life but intelligence flourish on this globe\r\n        under a great variety of conditions, as regards temperature\r\n        and surroundings, and no sound reason can be shown why\r\n        under certain conditions which are frequent in the\r\n        universe, intelligent beings should not acquire the highest\r\n        development._\r\n\r\n                SIMON NEWCOMB.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe argument most often urged against the idea that life exists in Mars\r\nis that there is no atmosphere in that planet, or if there is one it is\r\nso rarefied that it could not sustain life as we know it. According to\r\nProctor, we have heretofore been led to consider the planet's physical\r\ncondition as adapted to the wants of creatures which exist upon our\r\nown Earth rather than to ascertain the conditions which might obtain\r\nto enable life to exist on the surface of other planets. It is highly\r\nprobable that if an air-breathing animal of our earth were instantly\r\nimmersed in an atmosphere as rare as that of Mars, it would perish in\r\na short time. Precisely what a species through thousands of generations\r\nof selection and survival might adapt itself to, is an open question.\r\nLeaving this contention for a moment, let us consider the almost\r\ninfinite variety of conditions under which life exists on our globe,\r\nand we shall find that any and all conditions which the surface of Mars\r\nmay offer, if experienced gradually through successive generations,\r\nwould not be inimical to terrestrial life from the lowest to the\r\nhighest, including even man.\r\n\r\nMr. Garrett P. Serviss, in discussing the question of life, in his book\r\n\"Other Worlds,\" said: \"Would it not be unreasonable to assume that\r\nvital phenomena on other planets must be subject to exactly the same\r\nlimitations that we find circumscribing them in our world? That kind of\r\nassumption has more than once led us far astray even in dealing with\r\nterrestrial conditions. It is not so long ago, for instance, since life\r\nin the depths of the sea was deemed to be demonstrably impossible. The\r\nbottom of the ocean, we were assured, was a region of eternal darkness\r\nand of frightful pressure, wherein no living creatures could exist. Yet\r\nthe first dip of the deep-sea trawl brought up animals of marvellous\r\ndelicacy of organization, which, although curiously and wonderfully\r\nadapted to live in a compressed liquid, collapsed when lifted into a\r\nlighter medium.\"\r\n\r\nOne has only to make himself familiar with the wide range of conditions\r\nunder which life in various forms exists on the Earth, to realize\r\nthat the introduction of Martian conditions here would not be such an\r\noverwhelming calamity, and if these conditions could be introduced\r\nby minute increments covering thousands of centuries, it is not\r\nunreasonable to believe that myriads of forms would survive the change,\r\nand among those that survive would be precisely the kinds that thrive\r\nunder the most diverse conditions here--namely, man and the higher\r\nhymenoptera, the ants.\r\n\r\nTo enumerate, in the broadest way, the variety of conditions under\r\nwhich life exists here, one has only to enumerate creatures living\r\nin the deepest abysses of the ocean; high up on the slopes of the\r\nHimalayas; swarming in arctic seas; withstanding the hot glare of a\r\ntropical sun; living deep in the ground; breeding in the darkest caves;\r\nflourishing in desert regions; thriving in water below freezing, and\r\nagain in water nearly at the boiling point. Professor Jeffries Wyman,\r\nin a memoir on \"Living Organisms in Heated Water,\" has collected data\r\nshowing that fishes are found living in water ranging from 104° to 135°\r\nFahrenheit. He also found that low forms of plant life exist in water\r\nof various temperatures as high as:\r\n\r\n    168° F. observed by Dr. Hooker in Sorujkund;\r\n    174° \"     \"     \"  Capt. Strachey in Thibet;\r\n    185° \"     \"     \"  Humboldt in LaTrinchera;\r\n    199° \"     \"     \"  Dr. Brewer in California;\r\n    208° \"     \"     \"  Descloizeaux in Iceland.\r\n\r\nIf we consider man alone, we find him at Aden, on the Red Sea, at a\r\ntemperature of 130° in the shade, and in Siberia at 70° below zero;\r\ngrovelling in mines deep in the Earth, and living in great communities\r\nten thousand feet above sea-level; fighting battles on the slopes\r\nof the Himalayas, at an altitude of 19,000 feet; nomadic on sterile\r\ntracts; sweltering under the glaring sun of the equator, and existing\r\nin regions of perpetual snow and ice, and without sunlight for six\r\nmonths of the year. Such are a few of the varied conditions to which\r\nman has become accustomed since he emerged from his tropical and\r\narboreal relatives.\r\n\r\nThe question finally comes down to the effect of the rarefaction of air\r\non life. An inquiry as to how far man can stand changes of atmospheric\r\npressure is of interest in this connection, for we know that sudden\r\nchanges are accompanied by mountain sickness, at great elevations,\r\nand caisson disease under great pressure. Large birds soar among the\r\nhigh peaks of the Andes and drop at once to sea-level. I have dredged\r\ndelicate mollusks at a depth of one hundred and fifty fathoms of water\r\nand kept them alive for weeks in an aquarium. Man, while showing a\r\nsensitiveness to changes in barometric pressure when experienced\r\nsuddenly, can nevertheless get accustomed to great ranges of pressure.\r\nThe cities of Bogota and Quito are 10,000 feet above the level of the\r\nsea and yet in Quito when De Saussure, the naturalist, became so ill\r\nfrom the rarefaction that he could hardly find energy enough to read\r\nhis instruments, and his servants, digging holes in the snow, fainted\r\nfrom the exertion, the natives were pursuing their various activities,\r\nand bull-fights were going on! One has only to read the accounts of the\r\nEnglish expedition to Thibet to learn that troops fought in skirmishes\r\nat the height of 19,000 feet.\r\n\r\nMr. Douglas W. Freshfield (in \"Scot. Geo. Mag.,\" April, 1905) gives an\r\naccount of mountain sickness in the Sikkim Himalaya. He says the effect\r\nof high altitude was different in different individuals; some men were\r\nentirely free from it, and among them a Goorkha, who ran back in a pass\r\nat an altitude of 20,000 feet to hurry up some loiterers. Another\r\nmember of the party, an Englishman, actually gained in weight, and had\r\nan increased appetite. Here, then, are a few men among a small number,\r\nwithout previous experience in rarefied air, feeling no disturbance,\r\nand, in one case, actually benefited by it!\r\n\r\nThe question arises as to what natural selection would do among a\r\nhundred million say, who, through many centuries, might be subject\r\nto a gradual attenuation of the air. The result of rarefaction of\r\nthe atmosphere and the absence of moisture is associated with marked\r\nhygienic influences. The Hadley Climatological Laboratory of the\r\nUniversity of New Mexico has made special investigations as to the\r\nincreased lung capacity of those living at high altitudes, the relation\r\nof dry soil to health, etc. Important work has been done by Drs. John\r\nWeinzirl, C. Edw. Magnusson, F. S. Maltby, and Mrs. W. C. Hadley,\r\nand their investigations go to prove that high altitudes and absence\r\nof moisture are favorable to the health of man on this world, and by\r\nanalogy would not be inimical to the survival of certain forms of life\r\nin Mars.\r\n\r\nDr. S. E. Solby (in \"Medical Climatology,\" p. 43, 1897), in describing\r\nthe effects of rarefaction of the air says: \"The amount of air taken\r\nin at each breath becomes greater, and the air-cells, many of which\r\nare at lower altitudes often unused, are dilated.\"\r\n\r\nIf we consider the atmospheric pressure under which a man can work and\r\nlive, we find equal adaptability.\r\n\r\nMr. Gardner D. Hiscox, in his work on \"Compressed Air, Its Production,\r\nUses, and Applications,\" says: \"Experience has taught that the ill\r\neffects are in proportion to the rapidity with which the transmission\r\nis made from compressed air to the normal atmosphere. That while the\r\npressure remains stationary all subjective phenomena disappear.\" He\r\nspeaks of pressure of forty or fifty pounds to the square inch, and\r\nsays that, at these pressures, taste, smell, and the sense of touch\r\nlose their acuteness.\r\n\r\nIn the \"Engineering Record\" for January 23, 1904, there is an\r\ninteresting article on \"Caisson Disease.\" It says that twenty pounds\r\npressure per square inch is common on foundation work in New York, and\r\nthat bridge piers have been built when pressures of nearly fifty pounds\r\nwere required. The deepest pneumatic work in New York was done in the\r\nEast River gas tunnel, when the maximum pressure was about forty-seven\r\nto fifty pounds per square inch above atmospheric. In the gas tunnel\r\nfour men died from the effects of heavy pressure, while none died\r\nfrom that reason under bridge work. The article further says that\r\nordinarily \"strong young men in proper condition do not suffer from\r\nworking two four-hour shifts daily, under pressure up to twenty-five or\r\nthirty pounds; above that limit injurious effects may be felt,\" etc.\r\n\r\nLet any reasonable man consider the meaning of these data. Without\r\nany selective action on the race, without even a graded increase of\r\npressure from boyhood up, these workmen perform hard labor of stone\r\nexcavation at these pressures, and in the same way, without previous\r\nexperience, men are fighting battles at 19,000 feet altitude, and in\r\none instance growing fat at 20,000 feet. Eminent German and French\r\nscientists have studied the effects of pneumatic pressure by numerous\r\nexperiments on men and animals. One experimenter subjected a great\r\nnumber of dogs, cats, rabbits, guinea-pigs, and other animals to\r\nrepeated pressures up to one hundred pounds, and carefully observed\r\nthe effects of the varying conditions, some of which were fatal, while\r\nothers were apparently harmless. The experiments showed that sudden\r\nrelease from heavy pressures was fatal, but that if three or four hours\r\nwere occupied in reducing a pressure of one hundred pounds, it was\r\nharmless.\r\n\r\nWith these facts one cannot help wondering whether even man himself\r\ncould not exist on Mars if allowed time to get accustomed to the rare\r\natmosphere through thousands of generations of minute increments of\r\nadaptation.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact we use but a small portion of our lung capacity.\r\nLet any one experiment with himself and observe that after he has\r\ninspired the accustomed quantity of air he can continue for some time\r\nto inspire more air, and also when he has expired the accustomed\r\nquantity of air in normal breathing, he can continue to expire a\r\ngreat deal more air. Professor Jeffries Wyman, the famous lecturer on\r\ncomparative anatomy at Harvard, used to tell us that we ordinarily\r\ninspired about twenty cubic inches of air but we could inspire one\r\nhundred cubic inches more by an effort; also that having expired the\r\nordinary quantity we could expire a hundred cubic inches more and when\r\nthe lungs were removed from the body, an extra hundred cubic inches\r\ncould be forced from them. A surgeon friend tells me that many men live\r\nand work with the greater portion of both lungs diseased, and unable to\r\nperform their functions.\r\n\r\nIt would be an interesting inquiry to ascertain what other species\r\nof the animal kingdom has so wide a range as man. The dog evidently\r\nfollows him in all altitudes and at all temperatures.\r\n\r\nThe group of insects to which the bees, wasps, and ants belong, have\r\nalways been recognized as standing highest in intelligence among the\r\ninvertebrates. In the great work of Dr. and Mrs. Peckham on wasps are\r\nshown manifestations of intelligence among the wasps that are simply\r\nstartling, and the remarkable work of Miss Adele M. Fielde on the ants\r\nadds greatly to the evidences of their unique intelligence. The ant\r\nstands among the invertebrates much as man does among the vertebrates.\r\nOne has only to state concretely that ants practise a division of\r\nlabor; distinguish certain colors; estimate numbers; recognize friends\r\nand enemies; harvest seeds, and, it is said, raise them, hence are\r\ncalled agricultural ants; have insect cows and milk them; collect\r\nleaves which they chop up for the purpose of raising a kind of fungus\r\nupon which they live; organize raids and fight battles in masses;\r\nenslave other species; build covered ways and tunnels; and perform\r\nother acts of a similar nature.\r\n\r\nBearing these statements in mind it is an interesting fact that at\r\naltitudes in Arizona, where man finds it impossible to live except\r\nby fetching water from regions below, the ant, equally dependent on\r\nwater, has survived on these high tablelands, and manages to raise huge\r\ncolonies. In wandering over the mesa at Flagstaff, at an elevation of\r\nover 7,000 feet, the extreme dryness of the ground is indicated by long\r\ncracks which appear on the surface. Here, where hardly any insect is\r\nfound except an occasional roaming butterfly, the ant has survived and\r\nis met with in great numbers. Even a rare solitary insect known as the\r\nvelvet ant, and consequently without communal aid, is found chirping\r\nmerrily amidst these arid surroundings.\r\n\r\nIn this connection, it is interesting to observe that creatures endowed\r\nwith the highest intelligence, both vertebrate and invertebrate, manage\r\nto survive in considerable numbers in regions devoid of water.

A few nights\r\nwere cloudy and no observations were made. With these exceptions I\r\nwas in the observer's chair several times each evening. The twenty-four\r\ninch refractor of which I had the use was the last telescope Clark\r\never made, and he pronounced it his best one. This instrument (Plate\r\nVIII) is mounted on a mesa near the town of Flagstaff, Arizona, at\r\na height of over 7,000 feet above sea-level, in an atmosphere of\r\nremarkable clarity and steadiness. I have already stated on page 80\r\nmy first experiences in observing and will only present the brief\r\nnotes I made at the time of observation. Better results would have\r\naccompanied these efforts had I followed the custom of Michael Faraday\r\nand asked what was I to look at, what was I expected to see? I had been\r\nsomewhat prejudiced as to the existence of the canals by the comments\r\nof sporadic observers, many of whom, by the way, had never been able to\r\nsee them, and denying that any one else ever had, straightway proceeded\r\nto suggest a theory to explain their presence! Careful to avoid any\r\nbias in the matter I rigidly refused to allow either Professor Lowell\r\nor his assistants to suggest where I might find a canal or a marking on\r\nthe disk. The night before I left the Observatory for home I asked Mr.\r\nLowell for the first time, to indicate the position of some conspicuous\r\ncanal which I had not seen. This he did and examining the region\r\nwhich I supposed he had indicated on the disk I searched in vain for\r\nthe line. In doing so another line was detected and drawn, and on\r\nconfessing my failure to see the line he had described, showed him my\r\ndrawing, when he exclaimed, \"Why, you have got it,\" and sure enough\r\nwhen he showed me his drawing and repeated the directions he had given\r\nme, I found that I had been looking at the wrong pole of the planet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VIII\r\n\r\nTWENTY-FOUR INCH TELESCOPE OF THE LOWELL OBSERVATORY, FLAGSTAFF,\r\nARIZONA]\r\n\r\nIn one stage of great discouragement I came across a statement made\r\nby Mr. A. Stanley Williams which has already been quoted, namely,\r\nthat he had to observe continually for two months before sufficient\r\nsensitiveness enabled him to make out the more delicate markings. That\r\nI might have seen more had I been acclimated, and had been accustomed\r\nto telescopic observation there is no doubt. The record is poor enough\r\nand yet under the conditions mentioned the results may be of interest\r\nto the reader.\r\n\r\n  May 14. Midnight. Saw planet for the first time. A beautiful\r\n          luminous disk with shades of tone dimly visible. Southern\r\n          pole cap white and seen.\r\n\r\n  May 15. Certain details sufficiently distinct to make out dark\r\n          areas, and at times a line or two.\r\n\r\n  May 16. Occasional flashes of a few lines, while broad darkened\r\n          area and cuniform area on right visible, and, in one flash,\r\n          a line supporting the wedge as well as basal line. With no\r\n          better seeing conditions than last night, more details came\r\n          out, and for the first time I am encouraged to believe that\r\n          each day an improvement will take place. I saw enough to\r\n          make my first drawing.\r\n\r\n  May 17. Bad seeing. I made out only the broad southern band,\r\n          the line at the northern pole and the wedge-shaped area to\r\n          the right below, also a slight discoloration in the middle.\r\n\r\n  May 18. Not very good seeing. Could make out but little more\r\n          than I did last night.\r\n\r\n  May 19. Seeing about the same, perhaps slightly less. Saw rift\r\n          in southern dark band and north pole appeared luminous.\r\n\r\n  May 20. Mr. Lowell informed me this morning that the luminous\r\n          appearance around the north pole that I saw last night\r\n          was the result of a snowstorm. Seeing fair. Considerable\r\n          vibration of planet. Saw new snow field of the northern\r\n          pole distinctly outlined and much confused markings. Looked\r\n          in vain for spots but could not discern them.\r\n\r\n  May 21. Seeing clearer, and for the first time I made out\r\n          distinctly two spots, or oases. Mr. Lowell informed me that\r\n          Schiaparelli had never seen them. The snow which fell on\r\n          May 19 was still conspicuous.\r\n\r\n  May 22. With a headache and a seedy condition from not being\r\n          acclimated, I yet found an improvement in my seeing\r\n          capacities. I made out a promontory in the southern dark\r\n          belt, also a canal running down from the Trivium.\r\n\r\n  May 23. Bad seeing. Could not define snow cap though dark\r\n          southern band showed. Made no drawing.\r\n\r\n  May 24. Am in despair of seeing anything when the others see so\r\n          much. I must have an old and worn-out retina. In looking,\r\n          lines flash out at times but it is impossible to locate\r\n          them. I can certainly see more than Huyghens did, but not\r\n          much more.\r\n\r\n  May 25. Heavens very cloudy and Mars obscured.\r\n\r\n  May 26. Poor seeing--saw but a few markings.\r\n\r\n  May 27. Snow and hail storm in the afternoon. Temperature 35°\r\n          at night. Seeing zero, and consequently no observation.\r\n\r\n  May 30. To-night markings and more particularly shades seemed\r\n          abundant yet so evanescent that only an intimate knowledge\r\n          by long study could define them. I gave up in despair.\r\n\r\n  May 31. Saw a little more than I saw last night but did not see\r\n          a trace of things that Mr. Lowell and his assistants\r\n          apparently saw without effort. I realize that it requires\r\n          a special training to observe the flickering evanescent\r\n          markings on Mars.\r\n\r\n  June 1. Though the best night yet for steady atmosphere I saw\r\n          but little more and have come to the conclusion that it\r\n          will take months of continuous observation before I can see\r\n          anything.\r\n\r\n  June 2. I went to the Observatory to-night in despair of ever\r\n          seeing anything more. Got into the observing chair and\r\n          immediately saw a number of markings I had not seen before,\r\n          as my drawings show. I have purposely refrained from\r\n          studying the maps, and so do not know the names of the\r\n          lines detected.\r\n\r\n  June 3. Atmosphere so unsteady that it was impossible to make\r\n          anything out of Mars, so after struggling awhile gave it up\r\n          in disgust.\r\n\r\n  June 4. Seeing about 4, yet manage to see a few planetary\r\n          details.\r\n\r\n  June 5. I find a slow advance in my ability to see the markings\r\n          though it is exasperating that the janitor of the\r\n          Observatory talks about plainly seeing certain details\r\n          which he indicates to me by a sketch, and looking at the\r\n          region I can see no trace of a canal or anything else.\r\n\r\n  June 7. Seeing very good and in my observations tonight added\r\n          another canal. It is a most difficult matter to catch the\r\n          fleeting lines as they appear with startling distinctness\r\n          to instantly vanish again.\r\n\r\n  June 9. Seeing fairly good. Could make out but little more.\r\n          Color of regions very strong and vivid.\r\n\r\n  June 10. Seeing a little better than last night. Added three new\r\n          canals, and these canals flashed out three or four times\r\n          before I was willing to record them, and then I did not\r\n          believe them till Mr. Lowell showed me a drawing he had\r\n          made just before, and the two drawings corresponded.\r\n\r\n  June 11. Looked at eight o'clock and the markings of larger\r\n          features came out strong and dark and yet the seeing was\r\n          not estimated high.\r\n\r\n  June 12. Rather poor seeing though some of the dark regions came\r\n          out with remarkable distinctness. Every day I notice a very\r\n          slight improvement in detecting lines. Markings formerly\r\n          made out with great difficulty are now instantly recognized.\r\n\r\n  June 13. In my observations to-night added one new canal and\r\n          completed another, and was able to detect one that Mr.\r\n          Lowell had not seen during the evening--a well-known one he\r\n          says. It simply shows that one must continually observe as\r\n          the lines flash out for a single instant.\r\n\r\n  June 14. Made out still another canal to-night. The markings\r\n          show very clear, in fact some parts were vivid in\r\n          distinctness and the lower part of Syrtis Major dark blue.\r\n\r\n  June 15. Poor seeing, yet I was able to see a few of the\r\n          prominent features and defined the wedge-shaped region\r\n          below.\r\n\r\nOn Plate IX I give a few of my drawings of Mars in which are indicated\r\nthe lines I saw many times and was able to fix. Other lines flashed out\r\nfor an instant but these were not recorded, simply because I could not\r\ndefinitely locate them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE IX\r\n\r\n    MAY 19\r\n\r\n    MAY 22 Snow fell May 19\r\n\r\n    JUNE 5\r\n\r\n    JUNE 9-10\r\n\r\n    JUNE 13\r\n\r\n    JUNE 11-13\r\n\r\nDRAWINGS OF CANALS OF MARS BY THE AUTHOR]\r\n\r\nThe expression \"poor seeing\" in the above notes must be taken in\r\na comparative sense with relation to the usual conditions of the\r\natmosphere of Flagstaff. Poor seeing, therefore, at Flagstaff would\r\nbe equal, if not superior, to the best seeing at much lower levels.\r\nAn astronomer who resigned his position in a western observatory for\r\nduties at Mount Wilson, California, told me that for thirty consecutive\r\nnights the seeing was superior to the best nights he had observed in at\r\nhis former post.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\nWHAT THE MARTIANS MIGHT SAY OF US\r\n\r\n    _O wad some power the giftie gie us,\r\n    To see oursels as others see us!_\r\n\r\n                ROBERT BURNS.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor every single perplexity of interpretation we encounter in our study\r\nof the surface markings of Mars, the Martian would encounter a dozen\r\nperplexities in interpreting the various features on the surface of the\r\nEarth.\r\n\r\nAdmitting the conclusions of Lowell of the existence of intelligence in\r\nMars, and that that intelligence has been associated for ages with a\r\nplanet having only slight elevations of land, a tenuous atmosphere, a\r\nscarcity of water which has been utilized for ages through artificial\r\nchannels, as we have done in various parts of the world since\r\nprehistoric times, having vast tracts of sterile plains, and, within\r\nthese sterile tracts large oases fed by irrigating canals, regions of\r\nsparse vegetation, and no large bodies of water; with these conditions\r\ngoing beyond the history of these intelligences, what must be the\r\nMartian interpretation of the surface features of this world? It is\r\na perfectly fair inquiry, for by such means we may appreciate the\r\nattitude of some of our interpreters of Mars.\r\n\r\nIn examining the Earth, then, as we have examined Mars, the Martian\r\nwould find large yellow and reddish areas, extensive greenish areas,\r\nand, besides, large regions of varying shades of blue, possibly,\r\noccupying three-fourths of the Earth's surface. The yellow areas he\r\nwould interpret as desert land, the greenish areas he might consider\r\nvegetation, but what would he make out of the larger regions of blue?\r\nThis would certainly puzzle him, because, unfamiliar with oceans, he\r\ncould not believe that such vast tracts could really be water. He would\r\neasily interpret the polar snow caps, and the waters at their edges,\r\nbut the oceans would be impossible to solve. The suggestion, by some\r\naudacious interpreter, that this vast blue area was water, would be\r\nanswered by showing that these so-called bodies of water bordered vast\r\ntracts of sandy deserts with no canals running into them for irrigation\r\nor navigation purposes. Even the polar snow caps would be doubted,\r\nbecause they seemed to extend far down into temperate latitudes; and on\r\ntheir recedence in summer, there would be seen no dark, bordering seas\r\nas the result of their melting. The vegetation, instead of unfolding\r\nat the north and gradually extending southward, would unfold in a\r\ncontrary direction, appearing first in south temperate latitudes and\r\ndeveloping northward. The perennial character of the vegetation in the\r\ntropics would puzzle him. Even if he recognized oases in the deserts\r\nof America and Africa, the results of Artesian wells or springs,\r\nhe could not believe them to be vegetation; for he would detect no\r\nirrigating canals running into them. He would come to the conclusion\r\nthat no creature could possibly exist on the Earth, as the tremendous\r\nforce of gravitation with great atmospheric pressure would forbid\r\nthe existence of any organic forms. The immense clouds veiling the\r\nsurface must at times suffer condensation, and the impact of raindrops\r\nwould, from their velocity and weight, smash everything in the way of\r\nlife. Life, if it existed in forms supported by appendages, must have\r\nlegs of iron to sustain its weight, and a crust like a turtle to be\r\nimpervious to raindrops, and this would be contrary to all Martian\r\nanalogy. The courses of rivers, if detected, would puzzle him from\r\ntheir irregularity, unless he dared to suggest that these long sinuous\r\nchannels extending for thousands of miles were identical to the little\r\nrivulets he had studied near his own poles.\r\n\r\nIn fact, about the only feature outside the polar snow caps that\r\nhe would instantly recognize, would be the great ice cap of the\r\nHimalayas. India, that vast region extending from latitude 35° nearly\r\nto the equator, with its great plains and sterile regions, with its\r\noverpowering heat, and a dense population, depends for the sustenance\r\nof many of its millions upon the thousands of miles of irrigating\r\ncanals, fed from the melting snow caps of the Himalayas. India has no\r\ngreat lakes, but in the northern plains great rivers course their way\r\nto the sea. The Ganges and the Indus and their tributaries derive their\r\nwaters from the melting glaciers, and from these, a most extensive\r\nirrigating system of canals and reservoirs draw their waters. As\r\nthe heat increases the ice melts more rapidly, and so more water is\r\nsupplied at just the time when it is most needed. The whole scheme is\r\non so vast a scale that a Martian would recognize its meaning, though\r\nhe would wonder at the tortuous outlines of the larger canals.\r\n\r\nFlammarion has, in a similar manner, presented the arguments of Martian\r\nastronomers as to whether life exists anywhere but upon the planet\r\nMars. He says, among other fancies, that the sapient Martian argues\r\nthat houses could not be built on the Earth, on account of the violence\r\nwith which building materials, such as bricks, blocks, etc., would\r\ndrop, and thus endanger life. Believing that Mars is rightly balanced\r\nas to temperature, the Earth being so much nearer the Sun, would be too\r\nhot for life to exist. The Martian conceives himself to be supremely\r\ncomplete \"even to the point that artists wishing to represent God in\r\nour sanctuaries have figured Him in the image of a Martian man.\" The\r\nMartian considers our year too short. In his reflections he says:\r\n\"During the period in which one of us attains the middle age of fifty\r\nyears those on Earth have become decrepit old men of ninety-four, if,\r\nindeed, they are not already dead.\"\r\n\r\nSeriously, if there is an intelligence in Mars, it must have evolved\r\nalong the same general lines as intelligence has developed on the\r\nEarth. Being an older planet, it must have outgrown many of the\r\nvagaries and illusions which still hamper man in his progress here.\r\nIn the dim past, however, we can imagine some Martian astronomer with\r\nthe enigma of our Earth before him, and the great vault of heaven with\r\nits thousands of riddles unanswered, consulting records and covering\r\npages with mathematical formulæ to ascertain the precise spot upon\r\nwhich grew the bean stalk by which a Martian Jack ascended to encounter\r\nthe giant. Indeed, the imagination can conjure up an infinite number of\r\nparallels. If Mars is an older sphere, we trust it has long outgrown\r\nthe superstitions which still hamper man in his interpretation of the\r\ninexorable phenomena of Nature on this little planet. We may hope\r\nthat they have finally reached that stage when a dictum similar to\r\nthat of Huxley forms an engraved tablet in their temples of worship.\r\nThese are his words: \"Science is teaching the world that the ultimate\r\ncourt of appeal is observation and experiment, and not authority. She\r\nis teaching it to estimate the value of evidence; she is creating a\r\nfirm and living faith in the existence of immutable moral and physical\r\nlaws, perfect obedience to which is the highest possible aim of an\r\nintelligent being.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI\r\n\r\nSCHIAPARELLI, LOWELL, PERROTIN, THOLLON\r\n\r\n        _Every age has its problem, by solving which humanity is\r\n        helped forward._\r\n\r\n                HEINRICH HEINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn previous pages allusion has been made to the distinguished character\r\nof the astronomers who have contributed to a knowledge of the surface\r\nmarkings of Mars. Testimony from astronomical sources has been quoted\r\nas to their keen-sightedness in this work which, as Sir Robert Ball\r\nhas said, \"indicates one of the utmost refinements of astronomical\r\nobservation.\" That the reader may better understand the eminence\r\nof some of those whose names will forever be associated with the\r\ninvestigation of the surface features of Mars the following brief\r\nrecords are given.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GIOVANNI VIRGINIO SCHIAPARELLI]\r\n\r\nThe two astronomers most widely known in connection with the study of\r\nMars are Professor Giovanni Schiaparelli and Professor Percival\r\nLowell. Lowell had just graduated from Harvard, at the age of\r\ntwenty-one, when Schiaparelli, at the age of forty-two, made his\r\nfirst great discovery of the _canali_ of Mars. Macpherson, in his\r\nvaluable history of the \"Astronomers of To-day,\" says of Schiaparelli:\r\n\"His studies of meteoric astronomy, of Mars, Venus, and Mercury, of\r\ndouble stars and of stellar distribution, have given him a place\r\nsecond to none among living students of the heavens.\" From the same\r\ninteresting book we gather the following facts: Schiaparelli was born\r\nin Sabigliano, in Piedmont, in 1835. He attended the usual schools in\r\nhis native town and then entered the University of Turin as a student\r\nof mathematics and architecture. Before he was twenty years old he\r\ndecided to devote himself to the study of astronomy. At the age of\r\ntwenty-four he was an assistant in the celebrated Observatory of\r\nPulkova. When the kingdom of Italy was organized he became an assistant\r\nin the Brera Observatory, Milan. He became suddenly famous at the age\r\nof twenty-seven by the discovery of a new asteroid. In 1862 he became\r\nDirector of the Observatory. Schiaparelli's first great discovery was\r\nthe relationship between comets and meteoric showers. In 1872 he was\r\naccorded the gold medal of the Royal Astronomical Society for his\r\nvarious astronomical discoveries. Professor Simon Newcomb gives him\r\nhigh praise when he says: \"Among the individual observers Schiaparelli\r\nmay be assigned the first place in view of his long continued study of\r\nthe planets under a fine Italian sky, the conscientious minuteness of\r\nhis examinations, and his eminence as an investigator.\" Schiaparelli's\r\nresearches into the relation of comets and meteors \"were developed\r\nin 1873, in his remarkable work 'Le Stelle Cardenti,' which is,\r\naccording to Sir Norman Lockyer, one of the greatest contributions to\r\nastronomical literature which the nineteenth century has produced.\"\r\nMacpherson closes his interesting memoir of Schiaparelli by saying:\r\n\"His devotion to astronomy, his singularly accurate observations and\r\nhis wonderful discoveries have secured for him an exalted position\r\namong the greatest astronomers of modern times.\" For a further\r\nappreciation of the work of Schiaparelli the reader is referred to\r\nMacpherson's \"Astronomers of To-day.\" In this brief sketch the reader\r\nmay judge of the eminent character of one who insists that the lines\r\nin Mars are a persistent feature of its surface, whatever one's\r\ninterpretation of them may be.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PERCIVAL LOWELL]\r\n\r\nPercival Lowell was born in Boston in 1855. He was graduated from\r\nHarvard in 1876, and prepared for his graduating thesis an essay on\r\nthe Nebular Hypothesis. Lowell is a many-sided man. Early interested\r\nin mathematics, he became one of the founders of the Mathematical and\r\nPhysical Society of Boston. A visit to Japan, where he lived a number\r\nof years, resulted in the writing of three interesting books: \"The Soul\r\nof the Far East,\" 1886; \"Noto,\" 1891; and \"Occult Japan,\" 1894. During\r\nhis residence in Japan he was chosen foreign Secretary and adviser to\r\nthe Korean Special Commission, then about to visit the United States,\r\nwhich he accompanied. On his return to Korea he was the guest of the\r\nKorean Government, and this experience prompted him to write \"A Korean\r\nCoup d' État,\" 1894, and his well-known volume, \"Choson, the Land of\r\nthe Morning Calm,\" 1885. On his return to America he undertook an\r\neclipse expedition to Tripoli with Professor Todd. His early interest\r\nin astronomical subjects was now fully awakened, and the red planet,\r\nwhich he had observed in boyhood with a small telescope from the roof\r\nof his father's house, aroused his interest on account of the heated\r\ndiscussions over Schiaparelli's discoveries. With an impetuosity and\r\nenthusiasm which characterizes all his work, he set about to secure a\r\nproper region and a sufficient elevation for an observatory site. This\r\nwas found in northern Arizona at an elevation of over 7,000 feet. Here,\r\nthen, was established the Lowell Observatory with a twenty-four inch\r\nrefractor made by Clark especially for this Observatory, the last, and,\r\naccording to the maker's words, the best telescope he had ever made.\r\nLowell insisted that the location of an observatory was a much more\r\nimportant factor than the size of the instrument, and says: \"When this\r\nis recognized, as it eventually will be, it will become the fashion to\r\nput up observatories where they may see rather than be seen.\" It may be\r\nsaid with truth that, for the first time in the history of astronomy,\r\nan observatory has been erected and fitted for the special purpose of\r\nstudying the surface features of Mars. During unfavorable oppositions\r\nLowell has turned his attention to the other planets, notably Mercury\r\nand Venus, with the result of adding many new and interesting details\r\nconcerning these bodies. Three volumes of quarto memoirs and many\r\nbulletins from the Lowell Observatory attest to his industry. He has\r\nbeen fortunate in securing talented assistants, and their contributions\r\nmay be found in the various publications of the Observatory. The\r\ncharacter and importance of Lowell's work may be understood by stating\r\nthat the \"British Nautical Almanac\" is to adopt for the future the\r\nvalue of the position of the axis of Mars, and the tilt of the planet's\r\nequator to its ecliptic, which was furnished by Professor Lowell in\r\ncompliance with a request.\r\n\r\nMr. Lowell is a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences;\r\nMember of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain; American\r\nPhilosophical Society; Société Astronomique de France; American\r\nAstronomical and Astrophysical Society; Astronomische Gesellschaft;\r\nSociété Belge d'Astronomie; Fellow of the American Geographical\r\nSociety; Honorary Member Sociedad Astronomica de Mexico; and others.\r\n\r\nIn 1904 he was awarded the Janssen medal of the Astronomical Society of\r\nFrance for his researches on Mars.\r\n\r\nMr. Macpherson, in his memoir on Lowell, says that \"Mr. Lowell, by his\r\nunwearied devotion to astronomy, has already gained for himself an\r\nenduring reputation.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HENRI PERROTIN]\r\n\r\nM. Henry Perrotin and his assistant, M. Thollon, have been quoted\r\nin previous pages as having markedly confirmed the discoveries of\r\nSchiaparelli. Through the courtesy of Professor Lowell I am enabled\r\nto present the likenesses of these two astronomers. I am indebted to\r\nthe exhaustive work of Miss Agnes M. Clerke, entitled the \"History of\r\nAstronomy during the Nineteenth Century,\" for the following memoranda\r\nof some of the work accomplished by these men. Perrotin made a series\r\nof observations on Venus fully confirming Schiaparelli's inference\r\nof synchronous rotation and revolution: \"A remarkable collection of\r\ndrawings made by Mr. Lowell in 1896 appeared decisive in favor of the\r\nviews of Schiaparelli.\" In other words, Venus, like the Moon, presents\r\nthe same face to the Sun in its revolution about that luminary.\r\nPerrotin has made important observations on the rings of Saturn; his\r\ndouble-star measurements are also considered work of the highest\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: M. THOLLON]\r\n\r\nThollon has made many spectroscopic studies, among which were delicate\r\nexperiments showing the lateral displacement of lines in the solar\r\nspectrum arising from the Sun's rotation. In the Annals of the Nice\r\nObservatory he published a great atlas consisting of thirty-three maps,\r\nexhibiting in quadruplicate a subdivision of the solar spectrum under\r\nvaried conditions of weather and zenith distance. He also studied the\r\nspectrum of the great comet of 1882, and by the displacement of its\r\nlines estimated that the comet was receding from the Earth at the rate\r\nof from sixty-one to seventy-six kilometers per second. The Leland\r\nprize was awarded to Thollon for a hand drawing he made of the\r\nprismatic spectrum obtained with bisulphide of carbon prisms of high\r\ndispersive power.\r\n\r\nThe character and reputation of these men, as well as others who have\r\nbeen quoted in these pages, must be weighed against the few who, not\r\ncontent with denying the existence of the _canali_ in Mars, have in\r\nstrong language abused those who accept them as veritable markings on\r\nthe planet's surface.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII\r\n\r\nLAST WORDS\r\n\r\n        _The uniformity of the course of Nature will appear as the\r\n        ultimate major premise of all inductions._\r\n\r\n                JOHN STUART MILL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe final question is, do the lines as depicted and described by\r\nvarious observers exist on the surface of Mars? Those who have made the\r\ngreatest addition to our knowledge of the character of these lines,\r\nand have constructed maps based on Martian latitude and longitude are\r\naccredited on other grounds as being endowed with remarkable acuteness\r\nof vision coupled with persistence and painstaking care in observation.\r\nThe most successful work has been accomplished with instruments of fine\r\ndefinition in regions of steady atmosphere and high altitude, or at\r\nintervals of clarity and steadiness in regions otherwise unfavorable.\r\nFinally, and most convincing of all, Mr. Lowell's assistant, Mr.\r\nLampland, after many attempts has succeeded in photographing the more\r\nconspicuous linear markings. _The lines do exist essentially as\r\nfigured by Schiaparelli and Lowell._ It now rests with the objectors\r\nto suggest any better interpretation of the markings of Mars than that\r\nthey are the results of intelligent effort.\r\n\r\nThe mediæval attitude of some astronomers regarding this question\r\nrecalls the story of Scheiner, a Jesuit brother, who, independently\r\nof Galileo and Fabricius, discovered spots on the Sun. Eager with\r\nenthusiasm he informed his Superior of his remarkable discovery and\r\nbegged to be allowed to publish it to the world. The Superior replied,\r\n\"Go, my son; tranquilize yourself and rest assured that what you take\r\nfor spots on the Sun are the faults of your glasses or of your eyes.\"\r\nThis happened three hundred years ago, and yet to-day a few astronomers\r\nof this class still survive.\r\n\r\nIf one will calmly reason about the matter, let him consider a parallel\r\ncase of interpretation. He digs out from the ground a fragment of\r\nstone; its somewhat symmetrical shape suggests to him the idea that it\r\nmay be a rude stone implement. If he wishes to know what kind of rock\r\nit is and its geological age, he refers it to a geologist; if he wishes\r\nto know its composition, he asks a mineralogist, who, if necessary,\r\nwill analyze it for him. If, however, he is curious to know whether\r\nits peculiar, fractured surface is due to frost or other natural\r\nagency, or whether it is the work of some rude savage, he inquires of\r\nan archæologist, who alone will be able to tell him whether it is a\r\nworked stone or natural fragment. He will probably tell him whether\r\nit was shaped by paleolithic man, and whether it is a rough stone\r\nimplement or a core, _reject_ or chip. So with the study of Mars, as\r\nwe have already pointed out, there are certain matters of information\r\nabout the planet which the astronomer alone can impart, while the\r\nsuperficial markings are just as certainly to be interpreted by another\r\nclass of students who may or not be familiar with astronomical methods.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was quite natural that astronomers, the most conservative of all\r\nclasses of observers, should have doubted the first announcement\r\nof Schiaparelli of the startling discovery of the _canali_ marking\r\nthe face of the planet, the more so as year after year went by and\r\nyet with the utmost efforts of astronomers nothing of the nature of\r\nSchiaparelli's lines could be seen.\r\n\r\nWhat added greatly to the doubt about the lines, and at the same\r\ntime strengthened the idea that the lines were illusory, was the\r\nsubsequent announcement by Schiaparelli--undeterred by the universal\r\nskepticism--that at times the lines appeared double. What more\r\nconvincing evidence could be offered than that the phenomenon was\r\npurely subjective?\r\n\r\nA few astronomers expressed their doubts in a courteous though\r\nhesitating manner. Professor Young, in his valuable text-book,\r\n\"Elements of Astronomy\" (1890), in correctly reporting Schiaparelli's\r\ndiscovery says: \"He is so careful and experienced an observer that\r\nhis results cannot be lightly rejected; and yet it is not easy to\r\nbanish a vague suspicion of some error or illusion, partly because his\r\nobservations have thus far received so little confirmation from others,\r\nand partly because his 'canals' are so difficult to explain. They can\r\nhardly be _rivers_, because they are quite straight; nor can they be\r\n_artificial_ water-ways since the narrowest of them are forty or fifty\r\nmiles wide. To add to the mystery, he finds that at certain times many\r\nof them become _doubled_,--the two which replace the former single one\r\nrunning parallel to each other for hundreds, and sometimes thousands,\r\nof miles, with a space of 200 or 300 miles between them. He thinks that\r\nthis _gemination_ of the canals follows the course of the planet's\r\nseasons.\"\r\n\r\nThe overpowering belief that this world alone sustained creatures of\r\nintelligence formed an obstructive barrier to any and all attempts\r\nmade to uphold--at least by analogy--the idea of intelligence in other\r\nworlds. One cannot but regret that some philosopher had not, years\r\nbefore Schiaparelli's time, expressed the conviction that Mars might\r\nperhaps be more favorable to the existence of intelligent life than our\r\nown world, and with this conviction proceed to formulate the conditions\r\nwhich must of necessity exist: namely, that the planet being a much\r\nolder world than ours, its waters had mostly vanished by chemical\r\ncombination with the rocks and otherwise. Following this assumption,\r\nthe philosopher might have insisted that in the last extremity the\r\nmelting snow caps would be utilized by the supposed intelligences to\r\nfurnish water for potable and irrigating purposes. The philosopher\r\nmight have superadded to this idea the prediction that, when telescopes\r\nwere strong enough and eyes were keen enough, evidence of the truth\r\nof this supposition would be found in canals of some sort and that\r\nsuch lines should be carefully sought for. Fancy the exultation of\r\nSchiaparelli when at last he found the lines precisely as indicated.\r\nSuch an announcement from so distinguished an astronomer would have\r\nbeen hailed with acclaim. Alas! for the conservatism of astronomers,\r\nsuch powers of prevision are sadly wanting. Le Verrier's prediction\r\nof an outer planet was a matter of dead certainty. The perturbations\r\nof Uranus could not be accounted for except by the assumption of an\r\noutside body, and had it not been for the characteristic reserve of\r\nEnglish astronomers, Adams might have had the full credit. So rare\r\nare predictions of this nature in the history of astronomy that this\r\ninstance will probably be quoted to the end of time. The masses,\r\nstill ignorant of the certainty of mathematical astronomy, regard the\r\nprediction of an eclipse as in the nature of a prophecy. The liberal\r\nattitude of naturalists stands in marked contrast, and the history\r\nof their work is filled with examples of prediction and repeated\r\nconfirmations. Until the middle of the last century--grounded in the\r\nbelief of special creation--how wonderfully rapid was the conversion\r\nof naturalists to the theory of evolution after Darwin had offered his\r\nrational views on the subject. The existence of forms was predicted,\r\nbased on the idea of evolution, and these have been found again and\r\nagain. Our museums display in their cases remains of fossil animals\r\nwhich complete many series undreamed of in pre-Darwinian days. This\r\nwonderful work has been accomplished without resort to algebraic\r\nformulæ, and yet when mathematics can be applied, as it is in the law\r\nof variation, quantitative studies in heredity, and statistical methods\r\ngenerally, it is promptly seized upon by the biologist.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo one unconvinced of the existence of some signs of intelligent\r\nactivity in Mars the suggestions that have been made to account for\r\ncertain appearances in the planet will seem absurd. If, on the other\r\nhand, he finds himself in agreement with those who believe the markings\r\nare the result of intelligent effort, then he is justified in using the\r\nvarious artificial markings of the surface of the Earth as standards of\r\ncomparison in explaining the many curious markings of Mars. Indeed, he\r\nis compelled to do so, just as would be demanded of him if he should\r\nstand on some high mountain peak in some hitherto unexplored region\r\nof Africa and should minutely scan the hazy stretch of plains below.\r\nLarge white spots in equatorial regions which could not possibly be\r\nsnow-covered hills, might be masses of white flowers or cloth-covered\r\nareas for the better cultivation of certain plants. Lines that dimly\r\nstretched across the surface might be rivers, cañons, rifts, or bands\r\nof irrigation, according to their character.\r\n\r\nAs we compare the circular markings on the Moon with our terrestrial\r\ncraters and fissures, and cracks on its surface with similar fissures\r\non the Earth, so we are forced to compare the markings on the surface\r\nof Mars with what seems analogous to them on the surface of our own\r\nEarth.\r\n\r\nOnce proved that the markings of Mars are due to erosion, cracks,\r\nencircling meteors big enough to raise ridges by their attractive\r\nforce, then all that has been written in demonstration of their\r\nartificial character goes for naught. The intelligent reader\r\nunprejudiced in the matter will, however, judge for himself the\r\nmerits of our contention and will determine the reasonableness of the\r\ncomparisons that have been made by Lowell in solving the mystery of\r\nMars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n  Algebraic formulæ, 73.\r\n\r\n  American astronomers, Holden, Pickering, Young, Swift, Comstock,\r\n          Barnard, Wilson, drew the more conspicuous canals, 65.\r\n\r\n  Ancient irrigation, 115.\r\n\r\n  Ants surviving at high altitudes, 157;\r\n    unique intelligence, 156.\r\n\r\n  Astronomer's chief work, 74;\r\n    conservatism, 75.\r\n\r\n  Astronomers who have seen the canals, 83.\r\n\r\n  Astronomical subjects remote from Martian studies, 72.\r\n\r\n  Atmosphere and moisture, Barnard and others, 134, 135;\r\n    Sir Robert Ball, 137.\r\n\r\n  Austria's care of water, 117.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Ball, Sir Robert, difficulties of observation, 84;\r\n    life on Mars quite likely, 68, 69;\r\n    objection to Mars being inhabited, 121.\r\n\r\n  Barbour, W.

In\r\nviewing the Moon, when at quarter or half, the terminator is seen very\r\nragged on account of the illumination of higher points on the surface.\r\nIf the Moon was as smooth as a billiard ball the terminator would be\r\nclear cut.\r\n\r\n[3] The world in its ignorance of Italian assumed that the word meant\r\nexclusively canals, and, if canals, then dug by shovels. What! a canal\r\nthirty miles wide and two thousand miles long dug in the snap of the\r\nfinger? Impossible conception, you say. We shall see later the sober\r\nutterances of a member of the British Astronomical Society on this\r\ngratuitous assumption, and an equally serious comment by the chief\r\nassistant of the Royal Observatory at Greenwich (E. S. M.).\r\n\r\n[4] The views so long held that the dark shaded regions were bodies\r\nof water, or seas, was disproved by the observations of Pickering\r\nand Douglass, who distinctly traced the course of the canals across\r\nthese dark areas. The observations of Dr. E. Barnard certainly sustain\r\nthe contention that they are land areas and probably depressions,\r\nrepresenting ancient ocean beds. Dr. Barnard, using the telescope at\r\nthe Lick Observatory, says: \"Under the best conditions these dark\r\nregions which are always shown, with smaller telescopes, of nearly\r\nuniform shade, broke up into a vast amount of very fine details. I\r\nhardly know how to describe the appearance of these 'Seas' under these\r\nconditions. To those, however, who have looked down upon a mountainous\r\ncountry from a considerable elevation, perhaps some conception of the\r\nappearance presented by these dark regions may be had. From what I know\r\nof the appearance of the country about Mt. Hamilton, as seen from the\r\nObservatory, I can imagine that, as viewed from a very great elevation,\r\nthis region, broken by cañon, and slope and ridge, would look like the\r\nsurface of these Martian seas.\"\r\n\r\n[5] Sterling Heiley, in \"Pearson's Magazine,\" June, 1905.\r\n\r\n[6] A translation of which may be found in the \"Popular Science\r\nMonthly,\" Vol. XXXV, p. 532.\r\n\r\n[7] I may add that in a similar case an American student of Mars moved\r\nhis telescope to Mexico and remounted it at a cost of some thousands of\r\ndollars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber's Notes:\r\n\r\n\r\nPunctuation and spelling were made consistent when a predominant\r\npreference was found in this book; otherwise they were not changed.\r\n\r\nSimple typographical errors were corrected; occasional unbalanced\r\nquotation marks retained; inconsistent hyphenation retained.\r\n\r\nAmbiguous hyphens at the ends of lines were retained.\r\n\r\nPage 146: Quotation mark preceding 'The sale value' has no matching\r\nclosing mark.\r\n\r\nPage 192: \"Stetefelt's\" is spelled \"Stetefeldt\" on page 129. The latter\r\nis correct.\r\n\r\nPage 192: \"Tycho Brahe\" probably should be indexed as \"Brahe, Tycho\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Mars and its Mystery, by Edward Sylvester Morse",
