With slight\r\nvariation from the original text, the words of Thomas Jefferson about\r\nBenjamin Franklin and his maligners, quoted in the body of this\r\nmonograph, apply to this case: I have seen with extreme indignation\r\nthe blasphemies lately vended against the memory of the father of the\r\nAmerican plow. But his memory will be venerated as long as furrows are\r\nturned and soil tilled. The present object, however, is not so much to\r\nrefute falsehood as to establish the truth, and make it a part of the\r\npermanent knowledge of the public. To the extent that this object\r\nshall be attained, will these labors be rewarded.\r\n\r\nIt is not the design of this publication to disparage any one; on the\r\ncontrary, it is desired to give ample credit to all who contributed to\r\nthe solution of the plow problem. If only brief mention is made of\r\nothers, it is because they really deserved but little credit, or their\r\nmerits are forever buried in obscurity. It is proposed to set forth\r\nwithout exaggeration, the claims of the supreme inventor in this line\r\nto the grateful remembrance of the public. And by the public is meant\r\nnot only the American people, but all who are fed from the ample\r\ngranaries of this country, or share the benefits of the improved\r\ntillage, whether on this continent or in Europe, made possible and\r\nactual by the inventive genius of Jethro Wood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJETHRO WOOD;\r\n\r\nINVENTOR OF THE MODERN PLOW.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last words ever penned by John Quincy Adams were these, written in\r\nthe peculiarly tremulous hand of \"the Old Man Eloquent:\" \"Mr. J. Q.\r\nAdams presents his compliments to the Misses Wood, and will be happy\r\nto see them at his house, at their convenience, any morning between 10\r\nand 11 o'clock.\" This note was found upon his desk when he was\r\nstricken down with paralysis, February 21, 1848, in his seat in the\r\nHouse of Representatives. The Misses Wood here referred to were the\r\ndaughters of Jethro Wood, then deceased. They were at that time\r\nengaged in a labor of love, and the venerable Ex-President was their\r\nfriend therein. Prompted more by filial affection than by hope of\r\ngain, they were making a final effort to secure from Congress a proper\r\nrecognition of their father's claim as an inventor. It is entirely\r\nsafe to say that if Mr. Adams had been spared to the end of the\r\nCongress then in session, that claim would have been then duly\r\nrecognized, and the name, services and genius of Jethro Wood become\r\nfamiliar to the American public.\r\n\r\nJethro Wood was born at Dartmouth, Massachusetts, on the sixteenth day\r\nof the third month of 1774. His parents were members of the Society of\r\nFriends. His mother, Dinah Hussey Wood, was a niece of Ann Starbuck, a\r\nwoman of remarkable ability and high standing in colonial annals. Ann\r\nStarbuck was virtually governor of Nantucket. The niece was a woman of\r\nexcellent intellect, and most winsome character. Her conversation\r\nsparkled with genial wit and good cheer. Her husband, John Wood, was\r\na man of sterling worth, calm, self-poised, strong willed, and\r\neminently influential. Jethro was their only son. On New Years Day,\r\n1793, he was married to Sylvia Howland, at White Creek, Washington\r\nCounty, New York. The fruit of this marriage, every way a happy one,\r\nwas a family of six children, namely: Benjamin; John; Maria, wife of\r\nJeremiah Foote; Phoebe; Sarah, wife of Robert R. Underhill; Sylvia\r\nAnn, wife of Benjamin Gould. Of these children the only survivor is\r\nMrs. Gould, who with her sister, Phoebe, were the Misses Wood of the\r\nAdams note. So much for the domestic setting of this diamond of\r\ninventive genius.\r\n\r\nEven as a boy, Jethro Wood showed plainly the drift and trend of his\r\nmind. The child was indeed \"father of the man,\" and almost from the\r\ncradle to the grave, he was an inventor. In his childish plays he\r\nseemed busied with the idea which he ultimately perfected. Many\r\ncurious incidents and memories are treasured among the traditions of\r\nhis neighbors and friends. \"When only a few years old,\" writes a\r\nvenerable man whose recollection spans two generations, \"he moulded a\r\nlittle plow from metal, which he obtained by melting a pewter cup.\r\nThen, cutting the buckles from a set of braces, he made a miniature\r\nharness with which he fastened the family cat to his tiny plow, and\r\nendeavored to drive her about the flower-garden. The good\r\nold-fashioned whipping he received for this 'mischief,' was such as to\r\ndrive all desire for repeating the experiment out of his juvenile\r\nhead.\"\r\n\r\nSuch innate and ruling passion might be suppressed, but could not be\r\nsubdued. As his mind matured, his thoughts took definite shape. His\r\nhome was always upon a farm, but he was never a farmer, in the sense\r\nof Poor Richard's homely couplet:\r\n\r\n    \"He who by the plow would thrive,\r\n    Himself must either hold or drive.\"\r\n\r\nBorn in comparative affluence, blessed with a good education, an ample\r\nlibrary and a well equipped workshop, enjoying the correspondence of\r\nsuch men as Thomas Jefferson and David Thomas, he was unremitting in\r\nhis endeavor to realize his ideal. \"His chief desire,\" to quote\r\nfurther from our venerable correspondent, \"was to invent a new\r\nmold-board, which, from its form, should meet the least resistance\r\nfrom the soil, and which could be made with share and standard,\r\nentirely of cast iron.\" To hit upon the exact shape for the mold-board\r\nhe whittled away, day after day, until his neighbors, who thought him\r\nmad on the subject, gave him the soubriquet of the \"whittling Yankee.\"\r\nHis custom was to take a large oblong potato which was easy for the\r\nknife, and cut it till he obtained what he fancied was the exact\r\ncurve.\r\n\r\nThe manhood home of Jethro Wood was at Scipio, Cayuga County, New\r\nYork, a purely agricultural town, with nothing in its later history to\r\ndistinguish it; but in its palmier early days of the present century,\r\nit must have been a nursery of invention. Roswell Toulsby, Horace\r\nPease, and John Swan, of that town, each took out letters patent for\r\nimprovements in plows, and that prior to the issuance of any patent to\r\nMr. Wood. Their improvements were of no practical value, and played no\r\npart in the development of this branch of mechanism, but their efforts\r\nserve to show the state of the intellectual atmosphere breathed by the\r\nman who was destined to solve the knotty problem which underlies the\r\nvery foundation of scientific agriculture.\r\n\r\nOf the cotemporaries of Mr. Wood, who wrought at the solution of this\r\nproblem, the most illustrious was Thomas Jefferson, statesman,\r\nphilosopher and farmer.\r\n\r\nIn one of his letters to Jethro Wood, Mr. Jefferson spoke of his own\r\nlabors in that direction, as the experiments of one whiling away a few\r\nidle hours, but herein he did himself injustice. His efforts, however,\r\nwere far from exhaustive in their results, and it was with good reason\r\nthat he urged Mr. Wood to go forward in his undertaking, and no doubt\r\nhe was perfectly sincere in wishing him success. His correspondence,\r\nas published in nine large volumes, attests his long and deep interest\r\nin the problem, which it was reserved for Jethro Wood to solve. Having\r\ncarefully examined those volumes, to glean all there is in them on\r\nthis subject, I herewith append the observations found, for besides\r\nbeing in themselves interesting, in view of their authorship, they\r\nthrow important light upon the general subject.\r\n\r\nUnder date of July 3, 1796, Mr. Jefferson wrote to Jonathan Williams:\r\n\"You wish me to present to the Philosophical Society the result of my\r\nphilosophical researches since my retirement. But, my good Sir, I have\r\nmade researches into nothing but what is connected with agriculture.\r\nIn this way I have a little matter to communicate, and will do it ere\r\nlong. It is the form of a mould-board of _least resistance_. I had\r\nsome years ago conceived the principle of it, and I explained it then\r\nto Mr. Rittenhouse. I have since reduced the thing to practice, and\r\nhave reason to believe the theory fully confirmed. I only wish for one\r\nof those instruments used in England for measuring force exerted in\r\nthe drafts of different ploughs, etc., that I might compare the\r\nresistance of my mould-board with that of others. But these\r\ninstruments are not to be had here. In a letter of this date to Mr.\r\nRittenhouse I mention a discovery in animal history, very signal\r\nindeed, of which I shall lay before the society the best account I\r\ncan, as soon as I shall have received some other materials collecting\r\nfor me.\r\n\r\n\"I have seen, with extreme indignation, the blasphemies lately vended\r\nagainst the memory of the father of American philosophy. But his\r\nmemory will be venerated as long as the thunder of heaven shall be\r\nheard or feared.\"\r\n\r\nMarch 27, 1798, Jefferson wrote to Mr. Patterson: \"In the life time of\r\nMr. Rittenhouse, I communicated to him the description of a\r\nmould-board of a plough, which I had constructed, and supposed to be\r\nwhat we might term the _mould-board of least resistance_. I asked not\r\nonly his opinion, but that he would submit it to you also. After he\r\nhad considered it he gave me his own opinion that it was\r\ndemonstratively what I had supposed, and I think he said he had\r\ncommunicated it to you. Of that however, I am not sure, and therefore,\r\nnow take the liberty of sending you a description of it, and a model\r\nwhich I have prepared for the Board of Agriculture of England, at\r\ntheir request. Mr. Strickland, one of their members, had seen the\r\nmodel, also the thing itself in use on my farm, and thinking favorably\r\nof it, had mentioned it to them. My purpose in troubling you with it\r\nis to ask you to examine the description rigorously, and suggest to me\r\nany corrections or alterations which you may think necessary. I would\r\nwish to have the idea go as correctly as possible out of my hands. I\r\nhad sometimes thought of giving it into the Philosophical Society, but\r\nI doubted whether it was worthy of their notice, and supposed it not\r\nexactly in the line of their publications. I had therefore\r\ncontemplated sending it to some of our agricultural societies, in\r\nwhose way it was more particularly, when I received the request of the\r\nEnglish board. The papers I enclose you are the latter part of a\r\nletter to Sir John Sinclair, their president. It is to go off by\r\npackett, wherefore I wish to ask the favor of you to return them with\r\nthe model in the course of the present week, with any observations you\r\nwill be so good as to favor me with.\"\r\n\r\nWriting from Washington, July 15, 1808, to Mr. Sylvestre, in\r\nacknowledgment of a plow received from the Agricultural Society of the\r\nSeine (France), he adds: \"I shall with great pleasure attend to the\r\nconstruction and transmission to the society of a plough with my\r\nmould-board. This is the only part of that useful instrument to which\r\nI have paid any particular attention. But knowing how much the\r\nperfection of the plough must depend, 1st, on the line of traction;\r\n2d, on the direction of the share; 3d, on the angle of the wing; 4th,\r\non the form of the mould-board; and persuaded that I shall find the\r\nthree first advantages eminently exemplified in that which the society\r\nsends me, I am anxious to see combined with these a mould-board of my\r\nform, in the hope it will still advance the perfection of that\r\nmachine. But for this I must ask time till I am relieved from the\r\ncares which have more right to all my time--that is to say, till next\r\nspring;\" _i. e._ until after the expiration of his second term as\r\nPresident of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe importance of any step in civilization can be understood only in\r\nits relations, antecedent causes and actual results.\r\n\r\nThe _Scientific American_, which is certainly good authority in such\r\nmatters, ranks Jethro Wood with Benjamin Franklin, Eli Whitney, Robert\r\nFulton, Charles Goodyear, Samuel B. Morse, Elias Howe, and Cyrus H.\r\nMcCormick, and these are certainly the great names and this a just\r\nclassification. Each in his way laid the foundation on which all\r\ninventors in his respective line have built, and must continue to\r\nbuild, and none of them all came so near perfecting his grand idea as\r\nMr. Wood. His now venerable daughter stated the exact truth when she\r\nremarked in a letter not designed for publication: \"My father patented\r\nthe shape and construction of the plow. He took the iron and shaped\r\nthe plow that turns the furrow for every product of the soil in\r\nAmerica. His plow has never been improved. It came from his hand\r\nsimple and perfect, as it now is, and there is no other plow now in\r\nuse.\" It was not the use of cast iron that he invented, although the\r\nuse of \"pot metal\" by him occasioned a great deal of hostility to the\r\noriginal Wood plow.\r\n\r\nJethro Wood took out two plow patents, and those who wish to belittle\r\nhis work, descant upon the first as if it were his only claim to\r\ncredit. That first patent was issued in 1814. It fell far short of\r\nsatisfying the patentee's ambition. The plows made under it must have\r\nbeen a great improvement on any then in use, for although he\r\nabandoned it almost from the first, a great many of them were sold\r\nduring the period between the first and the second patents. The second\r\npatent dates from 1819. The natal day of the modern plow may be fairly\r\nset down as September 1, 1819. The original specifications in this\r\nplow deserve to be given in full, and may well be inserted in this\r\nconnection. The document was the handiwork of Mr. Wood himself, and\r\nruns thus:\r\n\r\n\"The Schedule referred to in these Letters Patent, and making part of\r\nthe same, containing a description in the words of the said Jethro\r\nWood himself of his improvement in the construction of Ploughs.\r\n\r\n\"Considering the manifold errors and defects in the construction of\r\nPloughs, and the inconveniences experienced in the use of them, the\r\npetitioner and inventor hath applied the powers of his mind to the\r\nimprovement of this noble utensil, and produced a Plough so far\r\nsuperior to those in common use, that he asks an exclusive privilege\r\nfor the same from the government of his country.\r\n\r\n\"The principal matters for which he solicits Letters Patent, he now\r\nreduces to writing, and explains in words and sentences as appropriate\r\nand significant as he possibly can. But, being perfectly aware of the\r\nfeebleness and insufficiency of language to convey precise and\r\nadequate ideas of complicated forms and proportions, the said Jethro\r\nWood annexes to these presents, a delineation upon paper of his said\r\nnew and improved Plough, with full and explanatory notes; urging with\r\nearnestness and respect that the delineation and notes may be\r\nconsidered as a part of this communication. The said petitioner and\r\ninventor also, being perfectly convinced, as a practical man, that a\r\nmodel of his inventions and improvements will convey and preserve the\r\nmost exact and durable impressions of the matters to which he lays\r\nclaim, he sends herewith a model of the due form and proportion of\r\neach, as a just exhibition of his principle and of its application to\r\nthe construction and improvement of the Plough, requesting that the\r\nsame may be kept in the Patent Office, as a perpetual memorial of the\r\ninvention and its use.\r\n\r\n\"In the first place, the said Jethro Wood claims an exclusive\r\nprivilege for constructing the part of the Plough, heretofore, and to\r\nthis day, generally called the mould-board, _in the manner hereinafter\r\nmentioned_. This mould-board may be termed a plano-curvilinear figure,\r\nnot defined nor described in any of the elementary books of geometry\r\nor mathematics. But an idea may be conceived of it thus:\r\n\r\n\"The land-side of the Plough, measuring from the point of the\r\nmould-board, is two feet and two inches long. It is a strait-lined\r\nsurface, from four to five and one-half inches wide, and half an inch\r\nthick. Its more particular description will be hereinafterwards given.\r\nIt is sufficient to observe here, that of the twenty-six inches of\r\nlength on the land-side, eighteen inches belong to the part of the\r\nPlough strictly called the land-side, and eight inches to the\r\nmould-board. The part of the mould-board comprehended by this space of\r\neight inches is very important, affording weight and strength and\r\nsubstance to the Plough; enabling it the better to sustain the\r\ncutting-edge for separating and elevating the soil or sward, and\r\nlikewise the standard for connecting the mould-board with the beam, as\r\nwill hereinafter be described more at large.\r\n\r\n\"The figure of the mould-board, as observed from the furrow-side, is a\r\nsort of irregular pentagon, or five-sided plane, though curved and\r\ninclined in a peculiar manner. Its two lower sides touch the ground,\r\nor are intended to do so, while the three other sides enter into the\r\ncomposition of the oblique, or slanting mould-board, over-hanging\r\nbehind, vertical midway, and projecting forward. The angle of the\r\nmould-board, as it departs from the foremost point of, or at, the\r\nland-side, is about forty-two degrees, and the length of it, or, in\r\nother words, of the first side, is eleven inches. The line of the\r\nnext, or the second side, is nearly, but not exactly parallel with the\r\nbefore-mentioned right-lined land-side, for it widens or diverges from\r\nthe angle at which the first and second sides join towards its\r\nposterior or hindermost point, as much as one inch. Hence, the\r\ndistance from the hindermost point of the mould-board, at the angle of\r\nthe second and third sides, directly across to the land-side, is one\r\ninch more than it is from the angle of the first and second sides,\r\ndirectly across. The length of this, the second side, is eight inches.\r\nThe next side, or what is here denominated the third side, leaves the\r\nground or furrow in a slanting direction backward, and with an\r\nover-hanging curve, exceeding the perpendicular outwards from three to\r\nsix inches, according to the size of the Plough. The length of this\r\nthird side is fourteen inches and one-half. The fourth side of this\r\nmould-board is horizontal, or nearly so, extending from the uppermost\r\npoint of the third side, to the fore part, or pitch, eighteen inches.\r\nThe fifth, or last side, descends or slopes from the last mentioned\r\nmark, spot, or pitch, to the place of beginning at the low and fore\r\npoint of the mould-board, where it joins the land-side. Its length is\r\nthirteen inches.\r\n\r\n\"Besides these properties and proportions of his mould-board, the said\r\nJethro Wood now explains other properties which it possesses, and by\r\nwhich it may be and is distinguished from every other invented thing.\r\nThe peculiar curve has been compared to that of the screw auger; and\r\nit has been likened to the prow of a ship. Neither of these\r\nsimilitudes conveys the fair and proper notion of the invention.\r\n\r\n\"The mould-board, which the said Jethro Wood claims as his own, and\r\nwhich is the result of profound reflection and of numberless\r\nexperiments, is a sort of plano-curvilinear surface, as herein-before\r\nstated, having the following bearings and relations: A right line,\r\ndrawn by a chalked string or cord, or by a straight rule, diagonally\r\nor obliquely upwards and backwards from a point two inches and a half\r\ninch above the tip or extremity of the mould-board to the angle where\r\nthe third and fourth sides of the mould-board join, touches the\r\nsurface the whole distance, in an even and uniform application, and\r\nleaves no sinking, depression, hole, cavity, rising, lump, or\r\nprotuberance, in any part of the distance. So, at a distance half way\r\nbetween the diagonal line just described, and the angle between the\r\nfirst and second sides, a line drawn parallel to the diagonal line\r\nalready mentioned will receive the chalked string or cord, or the\r\nstraight rule, as on an uniform and even surface without the smallest\r\nbend, sinuosity, or bunch, whereby earth might adhere to the\r\nmould-board, and impede the motion and progress of the Plough, under,\r\nthrough and along the soil.\r\n\r\n\"In like manner, if a point be taken one inch behind the angle\r\nconnecting the second and third sides, and a perpendicular be raised\r\nupon it, that perpendicular will coincide with the vertical portion of\r\nthe mould-board in that place; or, in other words, if a plumb line be\r\nlet fall so as to reach a point one inch behind the last mentioned\r\nangle, then such a plumb line will hang parallel with the mould-board\r\nthe whole way; the line of the mould-board there, neither projecting\r\nnor receding but being both a right line and a perpendicular line.\r\n\r\n\"Moreover, if a right line be drawn from a point on the just described\r\nperpendicular, an inch, or thereabouts, above the upper margin of the\r\nfourth side, and from the point to which the said perpendicular, if\r\ncontinued, would reach; if, the said Jethro Wood repeats, a right line\r\nbe drawn downward and forward, not exactly parallel to the diagonal\r\nherein already described, but so diverging from the same that it is\r\none inch more distant or further apart, at its termination on the\r\nfifth side of the mould-board, than at its origin or place of\r\nbeginning; such line, so beginning, continued, and ended, is a right\r\nline parallel to the mould-board along its whole course and direction,\r\nand the space over which it passes has no inequality, hill, or hollow\r\nthereabout.\r\n\r\n\"Furthermore, an additional property of his mould-board is, that, if\r\nit be measured and proved various ways, vertically and obliquely, by\r\nthe saw in fashioning it, by the rule in meeting it, and by the\r\nchalk-line in determining it, the capital and distinguishing character\r\nof right lines existing on, over and along the peculiar curve which\r\nhis mould-board describes, is always and inseparably present. This\r\ngrand and discriminating feature of his mould-board, he considers as\r\nof the utmost importance.\r\n\r\n\"He therefore craves the aid and elucidation of his drawing, and of\r\nhis model, in their totality and in their several parts, to render\r\nplain and sure whatever there may be, from the abstruse and recondite\r\nnature of the subject, uncertain or dubious in the language of his\r\nspecification.\r\n\r\n\"In the second place, the said Jethro Wood claims an exclusive right\r\nand privilege in the construction of a standard of cast iron, like the\r\nrest of the work already described, for connecting the mould-board\r\nwith the beam. This standard is broad, stout, strong; and rises from\r\nthe fore and upper part of the mould-board, being cast with it, and\r\nbeing a projection or continuation of the same from where the fourth\r\nand fifth sides meet. Its figure, strength, and arrangement are such\r\nas best to secure the connexion, and to enable the standard thus\r\nassociated with the beam, to bear the pull, tug, and brunt of service.\r\nBy a screw bolt and nut properly adjusted above the top of the\r\nstandard and acting along its side, assisted, if need require, by a\r\nwedge for tightening and loosening, the beam may be raised and\r\nlowered; and the mould-board, with its cutting edge, enabled to make a\r\nfurrow of greater or smaller depth, as the ploughman may desire, and a\r\nlatch and key fixed to the beam, and capable of being turned into\r\nnotches, grooves, or depressions on one edge or narrow side of the\r\nstandard, serves to keep the beam from settling or descending. By\r\nmeans of these screw bolts, wedges, latches, and keys, with their\r\nappropriate notches, teeth, and joggles, the Plough may be deepened or\r\nshallowed most exactly.\r\n\r\n\"In the third place, the said Jethro Wood claims an exclusive\r\nprivilege in the inventions and improvements made by him in the\r\nconstruction of the cutting edge of the mould-board, or what may be\r\ncalled, in plain language, the plough-share. The cutting edge consists\r\nof cast iron, as do the mould-board and land-side themselves. It is\r\nabout twelve inches and one half of one inch long, four inches and one\r\nhalf of one inch broad, and in the thickest part three quarters of an\r\ninch thick. It is so fashioned and cast, that it fits snugly and\r\nnicely into a corresponding excavation or depression at the low and\r\nfore edge of the mould-board, along the side herein before termed the\r\nfirst side. When properly adapted, the cutting edge seems, by its\r\nuniformity of surface and evenness of connextion, to be an elongation\r\nof the mould-board, or, as it were, an extension or continuation of\r\nthe same. To give the cutting edge firm coherence and connexion, it is\r\nsecured to the mould-board by one or more knobs, pins or heads in the\r\ninner and higher side, which are received into one or more holes in\r\nthe fore and lower part of the mould-board. By this mechanism, the\r\nedge is lapped on and kept fast and true, without the employment of\r\nscrews. That the cutting edge may be the more securely and immovably\r\nkept in its place, it has a groove, or ship-lap of one inch in length,\r\nbelow, or at its under side, near the angle between the first and\r\nsecond sides, for the purpose of holding it, and for the further\r\naccomplishment of the same object, another groove or ship-lap, stouter\r\nand stronger than the preceding, is also cast in the iron, at or near\r\nthe point of the mould-board, so as to cover, encase, and protect it\r\neffectually, on the upper and lower sides, but not on the land side.\r\n\r\n\"After the cutting edge is thus adapted and adjusted to the\r\nmould-board by means of the indentations, pins, holes, ship-laps, and\r\nfastenings, it is fixed to its place and prevented from slipping back,\r\nor working off, by wedges or pins of wood, or other material, driven\r\ninto the holes from the inner and under side, and forced tight home by\r\na hammer.\r\n\r\n\"In the fourth place, the said Jethro Wood claims the exclusive right\r\nof securing the handles of his plough to the mould-board and land-side\r\nof the plough by means of notches, ears, loops, or holders, cast with\r\nthe mould-board and land-side respectively, and serving to receive and\r\ncontain the handles, without the use of nuts and screws. For this\r\npurpose one or more ears or loops, or one or more pairs of notches or\r\nholders are cast on the inner side of the mould-board and land side,\r\ntoward their hinder or back parts, or near their after margins, for\r\nthe reception of the handles of the Plough. And these, when duly\r\nentered and fitted, are wedged in, instead of being fastened by\r\nscrews.\r\n\r\n\"In the fifth place, the said Jethro Wood claims an exclusive right to\r\nhis invention and improvement in the mode of fitting, adapting and\r\nadjusting the cast iron landside to the cast iron mould-board. Their\r\njunction is after the manner of tenon and mortice; the tenon being at\r\nthe fore end of the land-side and the mortice being at the inside of\r\nthe mould-board and near its point. The tenon and mortice are joggled,\r\nor dove-tailed together in the casting operation, so as to make them\r\nhold fast. The fore end of the tendon is additionally secured by a\r\ncast projection from the inside of the mould-board for its reception;\r\nand if any other tightening or bracing should be requisite, a wooden\r\nwedge, well driven in, will bind every part effectually, and all this\r\nis accomplished without the assistance or instrumentality of screws.\r\n\r\n\"The said inventor and petitioner wishes it to be understood, that the\r\nprincipal metallic material of his Plough is cast iron. He has very\r\nlittle use for wrought iron, and by adapting the former to the extent\r\nhe has done, and by discontinuing the latter, he is enabled to make\r\nthe Plough stronger and better, as well as more lasting and cheap.\r\n\r\n\"He also claims, and hereby asserts the right, of varying the\r\ndimensions and proportions of his Plough, and of its several sections\r\nand parts, in the relations of somewhat more and somewhat less of\r\nlength, breadth, thickness, and composition, according to his judgment\r\nor fancy, so that all the while he adheres to his principle and\r\ndeparts not from it.\r\n\r\n\"Regarding each and every of the matters submitted as very conducive\r\nto the reputation and emolument of the said Jethro Wood, he relies\r\nconfidently upon a benign and favorable construction of his petition\r\nand specification, by the constituted authorities of his country.\r\n\r\n\"Given under his hand, at the city of New York, this fourteenth day of\r\nAugust, one thousand eight hundred and nineteen (1819), in the\r\npresence of two witnesses, to wit:\r\n\r\n    \"SAM'L L. MITCHELL, }\r\n    \"J. G. BOGERT.      } JETHRO WOOD.\"\r\n\r\nThis patent expired by its own limitation in fourteen years, when it\r\nwas renewed or continued for another term of fourteen years. In view\r\nof the comparative ease and speediness with which the inventors of the\r\npresent day, or their assigns, utilize really valuable patents, it\r\nwould be inferred, in the absence of specific knowledge to the\r\ncontrary, that twenty-eight years constituted a sufficiently long\r\nperiod for the enjoyment by Mr. Wood, of \"the full and exclusive right\r\nand liberty of making, constructing, using and vending to others to\r\nbe used,\" the plow which he had invented. No doubt some members of\r\nCongress in refusing to continue the patent for a third term, acted\r\nfrom conscientious motives. But in point of fact, the period was\r\noccupied in a series of struggles calamitous to the inventor, to the\r\nhistory of which we must now turn. These struggles were unlike those\r\nin the lives of some other great inventors, notably, Goodyear and\r\nHowe. It was not a warfare for existence, the wolf of poverty staring\r\nhim in the face. The broad fields which he had inherited from his\r\nfather were adequate immunity from the sad fate too frequently\r\nallotted to inventors. But no benefactor of mankind in the domain of\r\nmechanism ever experienced more iniquitous treatment than Jethro Wood\r\ndid.\r\n\r\nBefore the year 1819 closed, his mission as an inventor was an\r\naccomplished fact. The popular name given his implement, \"The Cast\r\nIron Plow,\" from its entire abandonment of wrought iron in its\r\nconstruction, needed no change to be the noblest gift ever made to\r\nagriculture. In the ideal, hope had ripened into full fruition. And\r\nnow, at this day, looking at the matter in the light of the past,\r\nseeing the absolutely incalculable benefits of the invention, it seems\r\nalmost incredible that the American people, then even more than now, a\r\nnation of farmers, should not have hailed the new plow as an\r\nunspeakable boon, especially the community in which he dwelt, for\r\nCayuga county then, as now, under a high state of cultivation, was and\r\nis peopled by a population of much more than average intelligence. But\r\nan inventor, like \"a prophet, is not without honor save in his own\r\ncountry.\" His neighbors gravely shook their heads at \"Jethro's folly.\"\r\nWith almost entire unanimity they agreed that the new contrivance\r\nwould never work. His trials and difficulties at this stage of\r\nprogress are told as follows, by one who wrote largely from personal\r\nrecollection:\r\n\r\n\"He immediately began to manufacture his plows, and introduce them to\r\nthe farmers in his neighborhood. The difficulties which he now\r\nencountered would have daunted any man without extraordinary\r\nperseverance and a firm belief in the inestimable benefit to\r\nagriculture sure to result from his invention. He was obliged to\r\nmanufacture all the patterns, and to have the plow cast under the\r\ndisadvantages usual with new machinery. The nearest furnace was thirty\r\nmiles from his home, and, baffled by obstacles which unskillful and\r\ndisobliging workmen threw in his way, he visited it, day after day,\r\ndirecting the making of his patterns, standing by the furnaces while\r\nthe metal was melting, and often with his own hands aiding in the\r\ncasting.\r\n\r\n\"When, at length, samples of his plow were ready for use, he met with\r\nanother difficulty in the unwillingness of the farmers to accept them.\r\n'What,' they cried, in contempt, 'a plow made of pot metal? You might\r\nas well attempt to turn up the earth with a glass plowshare. It would\r\nhardly be more brittle.'\r\n\r\n\"One day he induced one of the most skeptical neighbors to make a\r\npublic trial of the plow. A large concourse gathered to see how it\r\nwould work. The field selected for the test was thickly strewn with\r\nstones, many of them firmly imbedded in the soil, and jutting up from\r\nthe surface. All predicted that the plow would break at the outset. To\r\ntheir astonishment and Wood's satisfaction, it went around the field,\r\nrunning easily and smoothly, and turning up the most perfect furrow\r\nwhich had ever been seen. The small stones against which the farmer\r\nmaliciously guided it, to test the 'brittle' metal, moved out of the\r\nway as if they were grains of sand, and it slid around the immovable\r\nrocks as if they were icebergs. Incensed at the non-fulfillment of\r\nhis prophecy, the farmer finally drove the plow with all force upon a\r\nlarge bowlder, and found to his amazement that it was uninjured by the\r\ncollision. It proved a day of triumph for Jethro Wood, and from that\r\ntime he heard few taunts about the pot-metal.\r\n\r\n\"It was soon discovered that his plow turned up the soil with so much\r\nease that two horses could do the work for which a yoke of oxen and a\r\nspan of horses had sometimes been insufficient before; that it made a\r\nbetter furrow, and that it could be bought for seven or eight dollars;\r\nno more running to the blacksmith, either, to have it sharpened. It\r\nwas proved a thorough and valuable success. Thomas Jefferson, from his\r\nretirement at Monticello, wrote Wood a letter of congratulation, and\r\nalthough his theory of the construction of mould-boards had differed\r\nentirely from the inventor's, gave his most hearty appreciation to\r\nthe merits of the new plow.\"\r\n\r\nIn this connection may be told a curious episode, one in itself worthy\r\nof record, and strikingly illustrative of the perversities of fortune\r\nto Mr. Wood in those gloomy days. It is the story of a Czar and a\r\nCitizen.\r\n\r\nAll uncertainty as to the feasibility of the new plow having been\r\nremoved, and actuated by that broad philanthropy which was one of the\r\npeculiar charms in the character of Mr. Wood, he desired to extend as\r\nwidely as possible the area of his usefulness, and concluded to make\r\nthe Czar of Russia, so long the chief grain exporting country of the\r\nworld, the present of one of his plows. During the Revolutionary war,\r\nthen fresh in the American mind, that great sovereign, Catherine of\r\nRussia, had been the staunch friend of this country, and that, too,\r\nwithout being impelled by jealousy of Great Britain. It seems to be a\r\npeculiar trait in the Romanoff family to admire liberty in the\r\nabstract, however absolute in practice. Sharing the prevailing good\r\nwill toward Russia, Mr. Wood conceived this happy thought of making a\r\ntruly substantial contribution to Cossack civilization, a civilization\r\never ready, with all its crudeness, to adopt foreign improvements.\r\nThat gift, in one point of view slight, proved of great benefit to\r\nRussian agriculture. It is impossible to state the extent of actual\r\nadvantage derived by Russia from that truly imperial gift. It was in\r\neffect giving to that country, second only to the United States in\r\narea of tillage, in proportion to population, the free use of the\r\nperfected plow. In an old copy of the New York _Tribune_, in its palmy\r\ndays of Horace Greeley and Solon Robinson, the tale of the Plow and\r\nthe Ring is unfolded. It runs thus:\r\n\r\n\"During the year, 1820, Jethro Wood sent one of his plows to Alexander\r\nI, Emperor of Russia, and the peculiar circumstances attending the\r\ngift and its reception formed a large part of the newspaper gossip of\r\nthe day. Wood, though a man of cultivation, intellectually as well as\r\nagriculturally, was not familiar with French, which was then as now\r\nthe diplomatic language. So he requested his personal friend, Dr.\r\nSamuel Mitchill, President of the New York Society of Natural History\r\nand Sciences, to write a letter in French to accompany the gift.\r\n\r\n\"The autocrat of all the Russias received the plow and the letter, and\r\nsent back a diamond ring--which the newspapers declared to be worth\r\nfrom $7,000 to $15,000--in token of his appreciation. By some\r\nindirection, the ring was not delivered to the donor of the plow, but\r\nto the writer of the letter, and Dr. Mitchill instantly appropriated\r\nit to his own use. Wood appealed to the Russian Minister at Washington\r\nfor redress. The Minister sent to His Emperor and asked to whom the\r\nring belonged, and Alexander replied that it was intended for the\r\ninventor of the plow. Armed with this authority, Wood again demanded\r\nthe ring of Mitchill. But there were no steamships or telegraphs in\r\nthose days, and Mitchill declared that in the long interval in which\r\nthey had been waiting to hear from Russia, he had given it to the\r\ncause of the Greeks, who were then rising to throw off the yoke of\r\ntheir Turkish oppressors. A newspaper of the time calls Mitchill's\r\ncourse 'an ingenious mode of quartering on the enemy,' and the\r\ninventor's friends seem to have believed that the ring had been\r\nprivately sold for his benefit. At all events it never came to light\r\nagain, and Wood, a peaceful man, a Quaker by profession, did not push\r\nthe matter further.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps another and quite as potent a reason why Friend Wood did not\r\nfollow up this matter was that weightier affairs demanded his\r\nimmediate and entire attention. One difficulty was overcome only to\r\ndevelop another. No sooner had he silenced the cavils of the farmers\r\nand demonstrated the value of his patent, than infringements upon his\r\nrights threatened to, and actually did, rob him of the fruits of his\r\ninvention. \"Uneasy rests the head that wears a crown\" of genius.\r\n\r\nThe patent laws of that day were very imperfect, and there was a\r\nstrong prejudice against their enforcement. The cry of \"no monopoly\"\r\nwas raised. Mr. Wood had expended many thousands of dollars in\r\nperfecting his patterns and getting ready to supply the demand which\r\nhe felt sure would arise for his plows, many of which, during the\r\nfirst few years, he gave away, that their value might be established\r\nto the satisfaction of the public. The stage of probation over, the\r\nplow makers of the country, defiant of patent law, engaged in their\r\nmanufacture. His patent had fourteen years to run. In an incredibly\r\nshort time their use by the farmers in all parts of the land became\r\nalmost universal, and had he been allowed a royalty, however small, he\r\nwould have realized a vast fortune. Instead of that he very nearly\r\nexhausted all his property in unavailing endeavors to establish\r\nthrough the courts his rights as inventor and patentee.\r\n\r\nIn 1833, when his patent expired, Congress granted a renewal for\r\nfourteen years. He was now bowed with the burden of years, and debts\r\nincurred in trying to protect himself against infringers. His\r\nremaining days were spent in vain efforts to maintain his rights. His\r\nbroad and kindly nature had conceived noble plans for the use of the\r\nwealth which at one time seemed so nearly within his reach. He had\r\nalways been deeply interested in education, and had fortune smiled\r\nupon him it is not too much to say that in spirit, however different\r\nin detail, Jethro Wood would have anticipated Stephen Girard, Ezra\r\nCornell and John S. Hopkins, in nobly founding a great institution of\r\nlearning.\r\n\r\nIn private life Jethro Wood was a model man. If he had faults it is\r\nimpossible to ascertain them, for it would seem, from the concurrent\r\ntestimony of all who were acquainted with him, that\r\n\r\n    \"None knew him but to love him,\r\n     None name him but to praise.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough a consistent member of the Society of Friends, Mr. Wood was\r\nextremely liberal in his religious views, and did not conform to the\r\npeculiar dress of the sect. He had that truly Catholic spirit so\r\nadmirably characteristic of the great Quaker-poet, John G. Whittier.\r\nNot even the cruel wrongs he sustained at the hands of dishonest\r\ninfringers could turn the sweetness of his kindly temper. Nature had\r\nendowed him richly in every way, and no gift had been abused.\r\nPhysically, his was the highest type of manly beauty. Six feet and two\r\ninches in height, perfect in proportion, courtly in manner, his\r\npresence was worthy his character.\r\n\r\nWe will not linger over the closing scene of his eventful life. That\r\nbelongs to the sacred secrecy of private grief. His death occurred at\r\nthe very threshold of a new conflict, and upon it his son and\r\nexecutor, Benjamin Wood, entered with intelligent zeal. The closing of\r\nit being reserved for two of his daughters.\r\n\r\nThe story of these new labors was well told several years ago by a\r\njournalist familiar with the facts, and we cannot do better than to\r\nunearth the record from its musty file, and by transcribing it to\r\nthese pages, give it a kind of resurrection worthy its importance.\r\n\r\n\"After the death of Jethro Wood, his son Benjamin, who received the\r\ninvention as a legacy, continued his efforts to wrest justice from the\r\nunwilling hand of the law. Nearly all his father's failures had\r\nproceeded from the inadequacy of the patent laws, which were almost\r\nworthless to protect the rights of the inventor. Even now a patent is\r\nworth little until it has been fought through the Supreme Court of\r\nthe United States. In those days so many obstacles were thrown in the\r\nway of inventors, and the combinations against them were so\r\nformidable, that Eli Whitney, in trying to establish his right to the\r\ncotton-gin in a Georgia court, while his machine was doubling and\r\ntrebling the value of lands through the State, had this experience,\r\nwhich is given in his own words: I had great difficulty in proving\r\nthat the machine had been used in Georgia, _although at the same\r\nmoment there were three separate sets of this machinery in motion\r\nwithin fifty yards of the building in which the court sat, and all\r\nso near that the rattling of the wheels was distinctly heard on the\r\nsteps of the Court House_.\r\n\r\n\"Similar difficulties had met Jethro Wood in _his_ suits; so his son\r\nresolved to strike at the root of the evil by securing a reform in the\r\nlaws. He accordingly went to Washington, where he remained through\r\nseveral sessions, always working to this end. Clay, Webster, and John\r\nQuincy Adams, all of whom had known Jethro Wood and his invention,\r\naided his son powerfully with their votes and counsel, and he\r\nsucceeded in securing several important changes in the patent laws.\r\n\r\n\"Then he returned to New York, and commenced suit to resist\r\nencroachments on his right, and the wholesale manufacture of his plow\r\nby those who refused to pay the premium to the inventor. The\r\n'Cast-Iron Plow' was now used all over the country, and formidable\r\ncombinations of its manufacturers united their capital and influence\r\nagainst Benjamin Wood. William H. Seward, then practicing law, was\r\nretained as Wood's counsel, and the plow-makers engaged all the talent\r\nthey could muster to oppose him.\r\n\r\n\"Heretofore it had never been contradicted that Jethro Wood was the\r\noriginator of the plow in use, but now his right to the invention was\r\ndenied, and it was alleged that his improvements had been forestalled\r\nby other makers. Again and again the case was adjourned, and Europe\r\nand America were ransacked for specimens of the different plows which\r\nwere declared to include his patent.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Wood also obtained from England samples of the plows of James\r\nSmall and Robert Ransom. He searched New-Jersey to find the Peacock\r\nplow which was said to have a cast-iron mould-board of exactly similar\r\nshape to his father's. Everywhere in that State he found 'Wood's plow'\r\nin use, but he could hear nothing of the one he sought. At length\r\nriding near a farm-house he discovered one of the old 'Newbold-Peacock\r\nplows' lying under a fence, dilapidated and rust-eaten. 'We don't use\r\nit any more,' the farmer replied to his inquiries, 'we've got one a\r\ngood deal better.' 'Will you sell this?' asked Wood. 'Well, yes.' And\r\nWood, glad to get it at almost any price, paid the keen farmer, who\r\ntook advantage of his evident anxiety, two or three times the price of\r\na new plow, and added the old one to his specimens.\r\n\r\n\"This motley collection of implements was brought into court and\r\nexhibited to the judges. At last, after the case had dragged its slow\r\nlength along, through many terms, and the plaintiff was nearly worn\r\nout with the law's delay, the time for final trial and decision\r\narrived. The combination of plow-makers feared that the case would go\r\nin Wood's favor, and made every effort to keep him out of court, that\r\nhe might lose it by default. During his long entanglement in the law,\r\nhe had contracted many debts, and one of his opponents had managed to\r\npurchase several of these accounts. Just before the case was to be\r\nheard for the last time, this worthy plow manufacturer, attended by a\r\nsheriff, and armed with a warrant to arrest Wood for debt, appeared at\r\nthe front door of his house. Fortunately Wood had had a few minutes\r\nwarning, and slipping out at the back door, he made his way under\r\ncover of approaching darkness to a house of a friendly neighbor. There\r\nhe procured a horse and started for Albany, 150 miles distant, hearing\r\nevery moment in fancy the clattering of hoofs at his heels.\r\n\r\n\"As if fortune could not be sufficiently ill-natured, his horse proved\r\nvicious and unmanageable, and thrice in the tedious journey threw the\r\nrider from his saddle upon the frozen earth, so injuring him, that he\r\nwas barely able to go on.\r\n\r\n\"On arriving at Albany he found himself not a moment too soon. The\r\ncase had an immediate hearing, and after three days' trial the Circuit\r\nCourt decided unequivocally that the plow now in general use over the\r\ncountry was unlike any other which had been produced; that the\r\nimprovements which rendered it so effective were due to Jethro Wood,\r\nand that all manufacturers must pay his heirs for the privilege of\r\nmaking it.\r\n\r\n\"This was a great triumph; but it was now the late autumn of 1845, and\r\nthe last grant of the patent had little more than a year to run. Wood\r\nagain repaired to Washington to apply for a new extension, but the\r\nexcitements of so long a contest had been too much for him. Just as he\r\nhad recommenced his efforts they were forever ended. While talking\r\nwith one of his friends, he suddenly fell dead from heart disease, and\r\nthe patent expired without renewal.\r\n\r\n\"The last male heir to the invention was no more. On settling the\r\nestate, it was found that while not a vestige remained of the large\r\nfortune owned by Jethro Wood when he began his career, _less than five\r\nhundred and fifty dollars had ever been received from his invention_.\r\n\r\n\"The after history of the case is a brief one. Four daughters of Jethro\r\nWood alone remained to represent the family. In the winter of 1848 the\r\ntwo younger sisters went to Washington to petition Congress that a\r\nbill might be passed for their relief, in view of the inestimable\r\nservices of their father to the agricultural interests of the country.\r\nWebster declared that he regarded their father as a 'public\r\nbenefactor,' and gave them his most efficient aid; Clay warmly\r\nespoused their cause, and the venerable John Quincy Adams, with his\r\ntrembling hand--then so enfeebled by age that he rarely used the\r\npen--wrote them kind notes, heartily sympathizing with them. On one\r\nmemorable day, while they were in the House gallery, Mr. Adams, at his\r\ndesk on the floor, wrote them briefly in relation to their case. A few\r\nminutes later he was struck with the fatal attack under which he\r\nexclaimed, 'This is the last of earth; I am content,' and was borne\r\ndying to the Speaker's room. The tremulous lines, the last his hand\r\never traced, were found on his desk and delivered to Miss Wood.\r\n\r\n\"A bill providing that in these four heirs should rest for seven years\r\nthe exclusive right of making and vending the improvements in the\r\nconstruction of the cast-iron plow; and that twenty-five cents on each\r\nplow might be exacted from all who manufactured it, passed the Senate\r\nunanimously. But Washington already swarmed with plow manufacturers.\r\nThe city of Pittsburgh alone sent five to look after their interests.\r\nMoney was freely used, and the members of the House Committee who\r\nwere to report on the bill were assured that during the 28 years of\r\nthe patent, Wood's family had reaped immense wealth, and wished to\r\nkeep up a monopoly. The two quiet ladies, fresh from the retirement of\r\na Quaker home, where they had learned little of the world, were even\r\naccused of attempting to secure its extention through bribery. It was\r\nthe wolf charging the lamb with roiling the water. So ignorant were\r\nthey of such means, that, though the Chairman of the Committee plainly\r\ntold the younger lady in a few words of private conversation that a\r\nvery few thousand dollars would give her a favorable verdict, she did\r\nnot understand the suggestion till after an unfavorable report was\r\npresented, and the bill killed in the House.\r\n\r\n\"When they were about to leave Washington, some friendly members of\r\nCongress advised them to deposit the valuable documents which had been\r\nused in their suit, including the letter from Thomas Jefferson to\r\nJethro Wood, in the archives of the House, where they could only be\r\nwithdrawn on the motion of some member. They did so, and left them for\r\nsome years uncalled for. When at last they applied for them they could\r\nnot be found. Nor from that time to the present has any trace of them\r\nbeen discovered by any of the family. Thus perished the last vestige\r\nof proof relating to this ill-fated invention.\"\r\n\r\nThis is a fair and candid statement, one fully sustained by\r\nunimpeachable documentary evidence. Especially by the somewhat\r\nvoluminous pamphlet entitled \"Documents relating to the improvements\r\nof Jethro Wood in the Construction of the Plough.\" A careful\r\nexamination of the testimony therein embodied, and of the\r\nCongressional Reports on the subject, warrant the foregoing\r\nstatements.\r\n\r\nIt is not strange that in an early annual report of the United States\r\nCommissioner of Agriculture, that official should have remarked with\r\nsome bitterness that \"Although Wood was one of the greatest\r\nbenefactors to mankind by this admirable invention, he never received,\r\nfor all his thought, anxiety and expense, a sum of money sufficient to\r\ndefray the expenses of his decent burial.\" The time long since passed\r\nforever to seek pecuniary indemnity; but a debt of gratitude never\r\noutlaws, and it is due to the great inventor that his countrymen\r\nshould gratefully cherish his memory. Every year adds to the debt we\r\nall owe him. As the area of cultivation widens, the obligation\r\ndeepens. Already America is the foremost nation of all the earth in\r\nthe production of wheat and provisions, the latter being in reality\r\ncorn in meat form. In exchange for our food supplies, the United\r\nStates is draining Europe of its gold at an enormous rate, and the\r\nfundamental element in the production of American wealth, is our great\r\nimplement of tillage. American prosperity is the monumental glory of\r\nJethro Wood and his plow.\r\n\r\n\"The Balance Sheet of the World\" shows that the United States can\r\nboast more acres of tillage, in proportion to population, than any\r\nother country on the globe; and in grain production, outstrips all\r\ncompetitors. Of such a record every American citizen may well be\r\nproud, and it should be remembered that without the genius of Wood\r\nsuch a record could not have been made, even approximately. But in\r\norder to a just appreciation of the importance of the modern plow and\r\nthe usefulness of the inventor of it, one should take a retrospective\r\nglance, tracing, as best we may without tedious details, the steps\r\nwhich led from the use of a forked stick to the present implement for\r\nfallowing the ground. The _Scientific American_, which ought to be\r\ngood authority on such a subject, in speaking of the Wood patent,\r\nsays: \"Previously the plow was a stick of wood plated with iron.\" If\r\nthis does sound like an exaggeration, but is really a plain statement\r\nof fact, consider for a moment what the plow really is in its relation\r\nto civilization.\r\n\r\nThe savage lives by the chase and upon the bounty of untilled nature.\r\nThe first steps toward civilization are to domesticate animals, and\r\ncultivate the soil with a rude kind of hoe. Both are alike primitive.\r\nThe next step is to press the beast into service by supplementing the\r\nhoe with a plow. In that implement we see what might be called the\r\noriginal strand in the mighty cord which binds in co-operation man,\r\nbrute and earth. By means of this agency of agriculture the beast of\r\nthe field is made to toil, and purchases the benefits of human\r\nkindness at the expense of idleness and industry. It is not too much,\r\nthen, to say that the plow is at once \"the tie that binds,\" and the\r\ntap-root which nourishes the world. If by some miraculous calamity\r\nthis one implement were forever swept away, universal and unappeasable\r\nfamine would be inevitable. And that occasional famines of a local\r\ncharacter are disappearing from the civilized world, is very largely,\r\nif not chiefly, due to the improved tillage resulting from improved\r\nplows.\r\n\r\nWe might well say, in paraphrase of a familiar saying attributed to\r\nNapoleon: Let me make the plows of a nation, and I care not who makes\r\ntheir laws.\r\n\r\nThe primitive plow was and is (for the barbarian of to-day is\r\nsubstantially the same in his agricultural methods as the barbarian of\r\nantiquity) simply a forked stick, to which is attached by a strip of\r\nrawhide or a wisp of grass, a beast, often the patient cow. As the\r\nprong passes over the ground, held down by the bowed form of the poor\r\ntiller, it barely scratches the face of the earth.\r\n\r\nThe first improvement was to reverse the stick and notch the forward\r\nend. By that means the animal could be more securely fastened to the\r\nplow, the thong being tied around the crotch of the stick. The shorter\r\nlimb ran along the surface of the ground, the notch in front being the\r\nonly reliance for stirring the soil. In the absence of a compact turf,\r\nsuch plowing would do a little good in rendering the ground fallow,\r\nand would at least have the merit of not being so difficult to operate\r\nas its predecessor.\r\n\r\nThe third plow had three parts. It consisted of a beam, a handle and a\r\nshare, all constructed by simply trimming the natural wood selected\r\nfor that purpose. In the first plow the prong which served as a share\r\nwas slanting, while in the third it rested flatly upon the ground,\r\nprojecting forward, instead of backward, as in the second plow. It\r\ncould have required no very difficult search to have found small\r\ntrees and broken limbs, needing no mechanical skill in fashioning, to\r\nrender them serviceable for such crude uses. They may be termed\r\nnature's contribution to the art of plow-making.\r\n\r\nWithout going further into details, it may be stated that a standard\r\nauthority on the history of mechanism asserts that \"the ancient\r\nEgyptian, Etruscan, Syrian, and Greek plows, were equal to the modern\r\nplows of the south of France, part of Austria, Poland, Sweden, Spain,\r\nTurkey, Persia, Arabia, India, Ceylon and China; at least such was the\r\ncase until the middle of the present century.\" The Roman and Gallic\r\nplows were better than those of the modern countries named. The Gauls\r\nhad mould-board plows. Pliny is our authority for this statement. That\r\neminent Latin author of eighteen centuries ago, in speaking on the\r\ngeneral subject, says:\r\n\r\n\"Plows are of various kinds. The colter is the iron part which cuts\r\nthe thick sod before it is broken into pieces and traces beforehand by\r\nits incision the future furrows, which the share, reversed, is to open\r\nwith its teeth. Another kind, the common plowshare, is nothing more\r\nthan a lever furnished with a pointed beak; while another variety,\r\nwhich is used in light, easy soils, does not present an edge\r\nprojecting from the share-beam throughout, but only a small point at\r\nthe extremity. In a fourth kind, again, this point is larger and\r\nformed with a cutting edge by the agency of which it cleaves the\r\nground, and by the sharp edges at the side cuts up the weeds by the\r\nroots.\"\r\n\r\nPliny adds that the broader the plowshare the better it is for turning\r\nup the soil. These excerpts from the great Roman may serve to show the\r\nutmost reach of invention in that line, until a new impulse, begun in\r\nthe Netherlands in the eighteenth century, was brought to perfect\r\ndevelopment in the next century by an American citizen who died the\r\npoorer for his invention.\r\n\r\nThe highest of all authorities upon this and cognate subjects is\r\n\"Knight's American Mechanical Dictionary,\" and Knight says of Jethro\r\nWood, \"He made the best plows up to date.\" He adds, \"He met with great\r\nopposition, and then with much injustice, losing a competency in\r\nintroducing his plow and fighting infringers.\" The same writer defines\r\nthe peculiarities of the Wood plow with remarkable clearness and\r\nbrevity: \"It consisted in the mode of securing the cast-iron portions\r\ntogether by lugs and locking pieces, doing away with screw-bolts, and\r\nmuch weight, complexity and expense. It was the first plow in which\r\nthe parts most exposed to wear could be renewed in the field by the\r\nsubstitution of cast pieces.\" Considering the source of this passage,\r\nit may be said that literature could hardly pay a nobler tribute to\r\nthe memory of Jethro Wood than this. It is doubly significant, from\r\nthe fact that Knight's publishers, Houghton, Osgood & Co., are also\r\nthe publishers of the _Atlantic Monthly_, in the May number of which\r\nmagazine a _habitue_ of the National Capital tried to belittle the\r\ninvention of Jethro Wood, and malign as iniquitous the attempt of his\r\ndaughters, championed by John Quincy Adams, to secure for that\r\ninvention proper recognition. It would be quite superfluous to follow\r\nthis maligner in the details of this, and a subsequent attack in an\r\nagricultural journal. He disclaims any design to defame the claimants,\r\nbut insists that other and earlier inventors deserve the credit for\r\nthe modern plow. The opinion of Knight's Dictionary upon the Wood\r\npatent has just been given, and the following extract from the same\r\ngreat work sets forth in their proper relations to the modern plow the\r\ninventions of those for whom this _habitue_ makes preposterous\r\nclaims:\r\n\r\n\"The modern plow,\" says Knight, \"originated in the low countries,\r\nso-called. Flanders and Holland gave to England much of her husbandry\r\nand gardening knowledge, field, kitchen and ornamental. Blythe's\r\n'Improver Improved,' published in 1652, has allusions to the subject.\r\nLummis, in 1720, imported plows from Holland. James Small, of\r\nBerwickshire, Scotland, made plows and wrote treatises on the subject,\r\n1784. He made cast-iron mold-boards and wrought-iron shares, and\r\nintroduced the draft-chain. He made shares of cast-iron in 1785. The\r\nimportation of what was known as the 'Rotherham' plow was the\r\nimmediate cause of the improvement in plows which dates from the\r\nmiddle of the last century. Whether the name is derived from Rotterdam\r\ncannot be determined.\r\n\r\n\"The American plow, during the colonial period, was of wood, the\r\nmold-board being covered with sheet-iron, or plates made by hammering\r\nout old horseshoes. Jefferson studied and wrote on the subject, to\r\ndetermine the proper shape of the mold-board. He treated it as\r\nconsisting of a lifting and an upsetting wedge, with an easy\r\nconnecting curve. Newbold, of New Jersey, in 1797, patented a plow\r\nwith a mold-board, share and land side all cast together. Peacock, in\r\nhis patent of 1807, cast his plow in three pieces, the point of the\r\ncolter entering a notch in the breast of the share.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that the credit given these improvers of the plow\r\nis very considerable, without at all trenching upon the exceptional\r\ncredit due to Jethro Wood. With such an authoritative refutation, the\r\nslander may well be dismissed as beneath further notice.\r\n\r\nIn no way more appropriately can final leave be taken of the subject\r\nin hand than by presenting the apostrophe to Jethro Wood from the pen\r\nof Edward Webster, formerly associated editor of the _Rural New\r\nYorker_:\r\n\r\n    No jeweled diadem or crown\r\n      E'er glittered on thy manly brow--\r\n    No slave would tremble at thy frown,\r\n      Nor at thy footstool bow;\r\n    For thou wert pure in heart and mind,\r\n    And strove to _raise_--not crush mankind!\r\n\r\n    As famed Prometheus of yore,\r\n      In aid of our lost, wretched sires,\r\n    Stole from the flaming-sun, and bore\r\n      Down to the earth those fires\r\n    That fill with light and life all space,\r\n    And mark the Day God's glorious race--\r\n\r\n    So thy inventive genius found\r\n      For man the bright and polished share,\r\n    That bids the willing fields abound\r\n      With fruits beyond compare;\r\n    And from the seed that falls like rain\r\n    Crowds full our barns with bearded grain!\r\n\r\n    Eternal may the honors shine,\r\n      We yield with grateful hearts to thee;\r\n    May children's children round thy shrine--\r\n      Sons of the brave and free--\r\n    With reverent lips pronounce thy name,\r\n    And build for thee a deathless fame!",
