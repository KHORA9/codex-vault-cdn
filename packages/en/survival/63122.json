GREELY.\r\n\r\n(_Presented to the Society January 23, 1891._)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn fulfilling the duties growing out of his official position in\r\nconnection with this Society, your Vice-President of the Geography of\r\nthe Air has been so closely occupied with executive and other official\r\nduties devolving upon him as to preclude his giving that amount of\r\ntime and labor to this annual report that the subject merits. Indeed,\r\nno report would be submitted this year had it not seemed better to\r\ninsure a continuity of these annual addresses, even if one of them\r\nmight not be up to the high standard which should be maintained for\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIt must have impressed every general reader of scientific journals\r\nthat the past year has been marked by the publication of an unusual\r\nnumber of controversial articles relating entirely or in part to\r\nmeteorology. Some of the discussions of this subject appear to be in\r\nthe nature of speculation, which, by good authority, is defined to be\r\n\"chiefly the work of the imagination, and has little to do with\r\nrealities.\" The status of the meteorological discussion which has been\r\ngoing on for some time seems to be this: A number of men, applying\r\nthemselves to investigation in separate branches or stages of the same\r\nscience, are attempting to reconcile their views, which, based as they\r\nare upon entirely different processes of investigation, are not\r\nentirely accordant. Some, at least, of these writers are still\r\napparently groping in the preliminary, the \"natural history\" stage of\r\nthe {42} science of meteorology, while one alone stands as the\r\nexponent of the \"natural philosophy\" of meteorology.\r\n\r\nTo me it seems that it could not have failed to impress any interested\r\nreader who has followed the late publications on the convectional\r\ntheory that, in order to clear the ground for definite meteorological\r\ndiscussion, it is necessary to determine the exact meaning of the\r\nvarious technical terms employed by the various writers. Whether from\r\nlooseness of verbiage originally or from the not infrequent habit of\r\ndisputants when worsted to change their ground by claiming to be\r\nmisunderstood, we find that some writers are unwilling either to stand\r\nby their first criticisms or to openly abandon them; they prefer to\r\nexplain away their defective statements and gradually shift around to\r\npositions almost diametrically opposed to those originally assumed.\r\n\r\nThe generally accepted theory as to cyclones attributes their\r\ninitiatory formation to an unequal distribution of temperature with\r\nresulting mean diminution of pressure, and the movement of the air\r\nfrom places of high to places of low pressure, the lower air ascending\r\nwith a gyratory motion, while air particles moving from opposite\r\ndirections form couples which produce rotation. When energetic motions\r\nraise the ascending air to such a height that the temperature, cooled\r\ndynamically in ascending, goes below the dew-point, then the great\r\nstore of latent heat thereby set free becomes, it is assumed, the main\r\nsource of energy in maintaining the upward convectional movement. The\r\nsubsidiary causes are attributed to the diminution of pressure on the\r\ncollapse of the vapor, and also to the direct absorption of the sun's\r\nheat at the upper cloud surface.\r\n\r\nIn anticyclones a slow gyratory descending motion of the air is\r\nassumed. Ferrel considers the cyclone and anticyclone one system, and\r\nbelieves that air flowing into the cyclone from a \"high\" at the ground\r\npasses out into the higher atmospheric strata.\r\n\r\nDr. Hann has put forth the hypothesis that the genesis of cyclones and\r\nanticyclones may be sought in the general atmospheric circulation\r\nthrough a difference of temperature of the air from the equator to the\r\npoles. He speaks of a congestion in the upper or anti-trade winds,\r\nwhere the air heaps up to a great height, this being the cause of the\r\nanticyclones; and he maintains that the low temperature of the \"high\"\r\nis due to ground radiation, and that no part of the high pressure is\r\nthe result of low temperature.\r\n\r\n{43} To this hypothesis of Dr. Hann, ascribing the genesis of storms\r\nto the general circulation of the atmosphere, no application of the\r\nlaws of dynamics has yet been made with a view of developing it into\r\nan acceptable \"theory.\" If it should be established it does not follow\r\nthat it will in any way affect the truth of the commonly accepted\r\n\"convectional system,\" which, founded as it is on the well-known laws\r\nof thermo-dynamics, is not likely to be successfully assailed. There\r\nmay be an improved nomenclature for the laws of statics and dynamics\r\nthat will express to the mind more clearly the relation of cause and\r\neffect; but until the advance of scientific research modifies the\r\npresent formulation of these laws the convectional theory will be\r\ngenerally accepted as giving the true interpretation of all the\r\nphenomena to which it could be applied.\r\n\r\nProfessor Russell, in commenting on this subject, expresses the\r\nopinion that the low temperature is due to the convective interchange\r\nof air at a low temperature in the upper strata with air of a high\r\ntemperature in lower strata, such convective interchange tending to\r\nmake the whole body of air of a temperature coinciding throughout with\r\nthe adiabatic rate of upward diminution, with the consequent result of\r\nrendering the air at the surface of the earth cooler than previously\r\nand the upper air warmer. When the upward diminution of temperature is\r\nless than the adiabatic rate, in the forced circulation of air\r\ncrossing a mountain ridge, there occurs the dynamic heating which is\r\nobserved in the case of the foehn winds. The low temperature near the\r\nearth he does not believe could ever be entirely produced by nocturnal\r\nradiation from the ground. The high pressure, in his opinion, is\r\nlargely the result of greater density due to low temperature, as is\r\nvery clearly indicated by the fact that the temperature is almost\r\ninversely proportional to the pressure, and that the places of lower\r\ntemperature substantially coincide with the places of greatest\r\npressure.\r\n\r\nIn advancing hypotheses and inviting discussion the real object is, or\r\nat least should be, to discover the essential cause or causes which\r\ndetermine the initial formation and subsequent maintenance and\r\nprogress of the cyclone. Some real progress in charting lines of equal\r\ndensity seems to have been made by M. Nils Ekholm following Professor\r\nAbbe's system of \"isostaths,\" one using the term density, the other\r\nbuoyancy. Professor Abbe also introduces the factor of the orographic\r\ngradient, but the {44} latter is simply the measure of a resistance.\r\nThe objection to this form of determination is this, that it is a\r\nmeasure of mass only. The density of two masses of air is determined\r\nto be the same; but as the density may result from two entirely\r\ndifferent causes, their physical relations cannot be fully expressed\r\nin units of gravity. The methods of Professor Abbe and of M. Nils\r\nEkholm undoubtedly give good results, partly from the coincidence that\r\nhumidity usually varies directly as the temperature.\r\n\r\nThe method proposed by Captain James Allen in 1888, which is briefly\r\ndescribed in appendix 24 to the annual report of the Chief Signal\r\nOfficer for 1890, appears to afford the means of more clearly\r\nexpressing the relations that exist between the mass of the atmosphere\r\nand the forces available for the generation and movement of storms.\r\nIts tentative application at the Signal Office has anticipated and\r\nexplained storm movements not indicated or accounted for by the usual\r\nmethods.\r\n\r\nAs pertinent to this matter, there is instanced a study of the\r\nprogress of thunder-storms made by Berg, who observes that the line of\r\nstorm front in every case investigated made a decidedly conspicuous\r\nbend into the densest part of the lines representing the absolute\r\nhumidity.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nScientific conditions have so changed that in these later years it\r\nbecomes more and more difficult for investigators to publish any work\r\nwhich may be characterized as _magnum opus_. Under this head, however,\r\nmust be classed Buchan's important memoir on the distribution of\r\natmospheric pressure, temperature, and wind direction over the whole\r\nworld; a large quarto volume, which contains much new material. It has\r\nbeen incorporated with the results of observations during the\r\nChallenger expedition, in which series this work appears. The isobars\r\nand isotherms for each month in the year for the whole earth are\r\ncharted on Mercator's projection, and for the northern hemisphere on a\r\nchart constructed on a polar projection. In connection with an\r\nabstruse subject, to which Buchan has paid so much attention, the\r\ndiurnal variation of pressure, he opines from the Challenger\r\nobservations that the oscillations are due to the heat taken from the\r\nsolar rays directly in passing through the air and instantaneously\r\ncommunicated through the whole mass from top to bottom by heating and\r\nevaporation of water on innumerable dust particles. The afternoon\r\nminimum, he thinks, is caused by upward currents removing a portion of\r\nthe lower air. Marked {45} differences exist between the continental\r\nand insular types, since on islands the morning minimum is unusually\r\nlarge and the afternoon minimum so small as to disappear, while in\r\ncontinental types the reverse conditions obtain.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWerner Von Siemens, in answering Sprung's criticism on his general air\r\ncurrents, after repelling certain statements of Sprung, describes his\r\nown theories, which are worthy of restating:\r\n\r\n1. All winds are caused by the disturbances of indifferent\r\nequilibrium, and the motion of the air is to restore equilibrium.\r\n\r\n2. These disturbances are caused through overheating of the layers of\r\nair near the surface of the earth by insolation, through unsymmetrical\r\ncooling of the higher layers by radiation, and through the heaping up\r\nof air masses caused by obstructions.\r\n\r\n3. The disturbances are adjusted by ascending currents, wherein the\r\nparticular species of acceleration occurs in which the increase of\r\nvelocity is proportioned to the diminution of pressure.\r\n\r\n4. The upward currents correspond to equally great descending currents\r\nin which there is a decrease of velocity corresponding to the\r\nacceleration in the upward velocity.\r\n\r\n5. If the region of overheating of the air is limited locally, a local\r\nupward current reaching to the highest layers of air arises, and\r\nwhirlwinds appear with interior spirally ascending currents and\r\noutside similar spiral descending currents. The result of this is\r\ndispersion of the superfluous heat of the lower air by which the\r\nadiabatic equilibrium is disturbed throughout the whole column of air\r\ntaking part in the whirling motion.\r\n\r\n6. In case the region of disturbance of the indifferent (or adiabatic)\r\nequilibrium is very extensive, as, for example, the whole of the\r\ntropical zone, the temperature adjustment can no longer be\r\naccomplished by locally ascending whirls, and a whirling current must\r\nthen arise involving the whole atmosphere. The same conditions apply\r\nto these as to the local whirls of accelerated upward motion and\r\nretarded descent in such a manner that the velocity at different\r\naltitudes arising from heat converted to work is approximately\r\nproportional to the prevailing pressure at the place.\r\n\r\n7. In consequence of the meridional motion produced and maintained by\r\nconversion of heat into work, the whole atmosphere in every latitude\r\nmust rotate with approximately the same absolute velocity. Thus the\r\nmeridional currents produced by overheating combine with the currents\r\nembracing the whole {46} wind system of the earth, with the result of\r\ndisseminating the excess of temperature and humidity of the torrid\r\nzone over the temperate and arctic zones, thereby producing the\r\nprevailing winds.\r\n\r\n8. This is accomplished by the production of alternating local\r\ndepressions and elevations of barometric pressure by the disturbance\r\nof indifferent equilibrium in the upper layers of the air.\r\n\r\n9. \"Highs\" and \"lows\" are a consequence of the temperatures and\r\nvelocities of the upper currents.\r\n\r\nWhence it follows that the most important problem of meteorology is\r\nthe investigation of the causes and consequences of the disturbance of\r\nindifferent equilibrium of the atmosphere, and the weightiest problem\r\nin weather prediction is the investigation of the geographical origin\r\nor extraction of air currents pursuing their course above us toward\r\nthe pole.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn Pomortsew's treatise on synoptic meteorology, published in Russia,\r\nthere are full chapters on prediction of weather, whether from\r\nsynoptic charts, from observations at a single place, or from\r\nprognostics of great length based on researches on the succession of\r\nwarm and cold months. It also contains Pomortsew's investigations on\r\nthe types of pressure distribution in eastern Europe, as well as the\r\naverage path of cyclones.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe favorable opportunities afforded by the Eiffel tower have been\r\nutilized by French meteorologists. M. Angot states that during the\r\nanti-cyclone of November, 1889, the temperature on the tower was\r\nseveral degrees higher than below. The change of weather set in\r\nearlier, with a strong and warm wind, on the tower, while the air at\r\nthe ground was cold and calm. Wind observations on the tower show a\r\nratio of 3.1 at that height (303 meters) to the velocity at a height\r\nof 21 meters, as determined from 101 days' observations, which,\r\nremarkable at such a small height, discloses the peculiarity of high\r\nmountain stations.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPartsch, writing on evidence of climatic changes within historical\r\ntimes in the Mediterranean region, remarks that too much attention has\r\nbeen given to changes in crops, the introduction of plants, and the\r\nlimits of domestic animals. He states that existing information as to\r\nthe harvest time of ancient days indicates an unchanged climate, while\r\nthe land-locked lakes in Tunis, which afford the best evidence on\r\nrainfall variation, show absolutely no climatic change.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n{47} Van Bebber, in writing on weather types, claims that a line drawn\r\nfrom the center of a cyclone perpendicularly in the direction of the\r\nheaviest gradients will in general be perpendicular to the subsequent\r\npath of the \"low,\" and that these lows leave high temperature on the\r\nright hand.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHill, in describing hail-stones and tornadoes in India, explains them\r\non the principle of the great diminution of temperature upwards in the\r\nair, but a critic, in combating this theory, objects to the high and\r\nlow stations selected to show temperatures.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe so-called \"weather plant\" of the tropics has passed through the\r\nprocess of investigation with the usual result. It appears surprising\r\nthat in these days it should be believed that any plant or animal can\r\nforetell weather 48 hours in advance, particularly after considering\r\nthe vast amount of proof as to the enormous rapidity with which\r\nweather-changes progress from day to day.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHugo Meyer, in treating the precipitation of central Germany for the\r\nten years ending in 1885, pertinently remarks that the same\r\nsignificance does not attach to the same rainfall for all places and\r\ndifferent times of the year, for this average value is not the amount\r\nmost likely to fall in any particular interval of time, since there is\r\na limit to the extent of the negative deviations on one side--that is,\r\n0 or no rainfall, while on the positive side there is no limit. The\r\nmost probable depth of rainfall, therefore, is less than the mean\r\nvalue, the preponderance of negative over positive deviations being\r\nabout 10 per cent. and sometimes as great as 20 per cent.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nProfessor W. M. Davis wrote an interesting review of Professor\r\nFerrel's popular treatise on the winds, published a year ago.\r\nCommenting on the review, the editor of _Meteorologische Zeltschrift_,\r\nVienna, remarks on a very important omission in the treatise, namely,\r\nthe absence of all reference to the diurnal variation of the wind and\r\nthe many interesting relations it bears to other phenomena, a notable\r\nomission in a treatise specially devoted to winds. The treatment of\r\nthe monsoon wind and its relation to the general circulation is highly\r\ncommended by the editor, and indicated as being all new.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nYour Vice-President has elsewhere expressed his opinion that monsoon\r\nwinds, applying the term by liberal construction to signify winds\r\nwhich recur with returning seasons, cannot with {48} any degree of\r\ncorrectness be asserted to prevail in the United States. It is true\r\nthat the prevailing surface winds of the greater part of the United\r\nStates come from the western quadrants--that is, between southwest and\r\nnorthwest--and so are in substantial harmony with the general\r\natmospheric circulation as shown by the upper-wind currents of Mount\r\nWashington (from the northwest) and Pike's peak (from the southwest).\r\nBut, apart from the easterly and northeasterly trades on the Florida\r\ncoast, it appears from the records that in no case for any\r\nconsiderable section of the country do 50 per cent. of the winds blow,\r\nfor any consecutive number of months, either from any single point or\r\nfrom two neighboring points of the compass. Occasionally, however, the\r\nlocal configuration of the country is such that winds are drawn up or\r\ndown valleys, and, being diverted from their free and proper\r\ndirection, the wind in such cases follows the trend of the valley or\r\ndepression.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn general your Vice-President would feel inclined to refer only\r\ncasually to the work proceeding from the Bureau over which he has the\r\nhonor to preside, but this year has been marked by special researches\r\nand investigations of general interest. As the work of investigation\r\nhas been entrusted to the professors of the Signal Service, due credit\r\nshould not be refused them from their own official chief.\r\n\r\nSpecial reference should be made to the work of Professor Charles F.\r\nMarvin, whose successful experiments on wind pressures and velocities\r\nhave attracted the attention of experts both in Europe and in this\r\ncountry. Unfortunately there was available only a small sum (about one\r\nhundred dollars) for the expense of experiments, but with this petty\r\nsum, supplemented by his ingenuity, Professor Marvin has very\r\nsatisfactorily determined the coëfficients of the various forms of the\r\nRobinson anemometer, with which instrument the velocity of the wind is\r\nvery generally determined. Following these investigations, the Royal\r\nMeteorological Society of England reopened the question, which, after\r\na costly set of experiments with results widely differing from those\r\nof Professor Marvin, had been considered closed.\r\n\r\nThe general results of these researches, which are believed to be\r\nsufficiently definite for general questions, are not only prized by\r\nthe scientist, but they are of value to the engineer and the builder.\r\nIndeed, to all interested in costly structures or extended works\r\nliable to harm from wind pressures, the factor of safety is {49} a\r\nmatter of no small pecuniary importance. These experiments show that,\r\nas was formerly believed to be the case, the wind pressure varies as\r\nthe square of the velocity of the wind, expressed in miles per hour;\r\nbut a most important fact has developed, namely, that the pressure in\r\npounds per square foot is equal to the miles of hourly velocity\r\nmultiplied by 0.004 instead of 0.005, as was formerly assumed.\r\n\r\nProfessor Marvin was not content with one system of experiments, but\r\nhe further attacked the problem in a direct manner by a method which\r\nchecked and verified his experiments with the whirling machine. On the\r\nsummit of Mount Washington, at an elevation of 6,300 feet, he obtained\r\nsimultaneously and under the same conditions, by automatic and\r\nelectrical apparatus, continuous registration of the pressure of the\r\nwind in pounds per square foot and of the velocity in miles per hour.\r\n\r\nThe results thus verified can be considered as conclusive from a\r\ngeneral standpoint. The corrections for the Robinson anemometer thus\r\ndetermined from these experiments are comparatively unimportant at low\r\nvelocities, say from 10 to 15 miles per hour, being only a fraction of\r\na mile per hour. The uncorrected velocities, however, are in all cases\r\ntoo large, and by greater and greater amounts the higher the velocity.\r\nAt 60 miles per hour the observed velocities are about 12 miles per\r\nhour too high, and for an indicated velocity of 90 miles the\r\nexperiments show that the actual velocity is but a fraction over 69\r\nmiles per hour.\r\n\r\nThe anemometer formula found to satisfy most closely the entire range\r\nof experiments has the following form for velocities in miles per\r\nhour:\r\n\r\n  Log. _V_ = 0.509 + 0.9012 log. _v_.\r\n\r\nThis difference indicated by the formula may seem small and\r\ninsignificant, as it is in the case of light winds, but at very high\r\nvelocities the differences are very great. For instance, an actual\r\nvelocity of 60 miles per hour may occur at some time in almost any\r\nlocality of the United States for a few minutes, and even greater\r\nvelocities are occasionally reported, apart from severe tornadoes.\r\nUnder the old coëfficients for the Robinson anemometer an actual\r\nvelocity of 60 miles per hour would have been reported as 77 miles per\r\nhour, which under the old factor of 0.005 would mean a pressure of\r\n29.6 pounds per square foot; but when considered with reference to the\r\ntrue velocity of 60 miles, under {50} the new factor of 0.004, the\r\npressure would only be 14.4 pounds per square foot--a reduction of\r\nover 50 per cent. from the pressure-values formerly accepted.\r\n\r\nProfessor Marvin has undertaken to verify, and also to extend to even\r\nlower temperatures, the observations of Regnault as to the pressure of\r\naqueous vapor at low temperatures, especial attention being given to\r\ntemperature conditions from 0° centigrade to -50° centigrade. These\r\nobservations disclose, below 0° centigrade, small but constant\r\ndifferences from the values assigned by Regnault.\r\n\r\nIn all this work Professor Marvin has shown such ingenuity of\r\nresource, such skill in adapting means to the end, and such deftness\r\nin improvising and manufacturing the requisite instruments as have\r\nelicited commendation from all who have seen his work and followed his\r\nmethods. Your Vice-President alludes to this not only to give that\r\ncredit rightfully due to Professor Marvin, but to illustrate this as a\r\ntype of the highly important work which is being done in all branches\r\nof science here in Washington by young men sometimes illy equipped as\r\nto means, and still more illy paid. Men engaged in work of original\r\ninvestigation should receive higher pay than clerks in charge of\r\nroutine duties; but unfortunately the majority of them do not.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe work of Professor Hazen in charting tornadoes and in determining\r\ntheir relative frequency and severity is directly in the line of the\r\nGeography of the Air.\r\n\r\nGreat attention had previously been given to this subject by\r\nLieutenant John P. Finley, who, with indefatigable industry, had\r\naccumulated an enormous mass of data relative to these violent\r\noutbursts of nature's forces. The figures and deductions previously\r\nput forth under the authority of the Signal Service having been\r\nquestioned, the Chief Signal Officer felt obliged, in view of the\r\ngrowing practical importance of the question, as indicated by the\r\ngreat sums annually paid out in the Ohio valley and in the\r\ntrans-Mississippi region for protection against tornadoes, to reöpen\r\nthe subject. Instructions of the most conservative character were\r\ngiven to Professor Hazen to determine carefully the prevalence and\r\nnumber of tornadoes in the United States, the areas devastated by\r\nthem, and the number of lives lost annually. This work was carefully\r\nscrutinized during its progress to see that it should be devoid of\r\ntheory and rest on the solid basis of fact. The results are most\r\nassuring to every {51} one, and must serve to allay the unreasonable\r\nfears of the inhabitants of the so-called \"tornado districts.\" It\r\nappears that there is no part of the United States in which annually\r\nmore than one square mile of devastation or severe destruction can be\r\nexpected for each 185,000 square miles, although cases of _limited\r\ndestruction_ may occur annually for about every 5,000 square miles of\r\narea. In no state may destructive tornadoes be expected, on an\r\naverage, more than once in two years; and the area over which total\r\ndestruction can be expected is, as shown by the foregoing figures,\r\nexceedingly small, even in localities most liable to these violent\r\nstorms. The annual death casualties from tornadoes have averaged, in\r\nthe last 18 years, 102 annually; but it is believed that the death\r\nrate from lightning is greater than that from tornadoes, since during\r\nMarch to August, 1890, the names of 110 are on record who have lost\r\ntheir lives by lightning, although the data are incomplete, especially\r\nas regards the southern states. These statistics cannot be passed by\r\nlightly, however, and it is doubtful if in the main they are much in\r\nerror. By them it appears from five years' record that the average\r\nannual death rate by lightning in the United States is 3.8 per million\r\nof inhabitants, or 0.2 above the average. In Sweden, for sixty years,\r\nthe average has been 3.0; in France, for forty-nine years, 3.1; in\r\nBaden, for seventeen years, 3.8; and in Prussia, for fifteen years,\r\n4.4 per million.\r\n\r\nOther figures, given by a life-insurance agent in St. Louis, which the\r\nauthor claims to have compiled with great care, place the average\r\nannual rate of death from lightning in the United States at 206, being\r\nmore than double the deaths from tornadoes. It must be understood that\r\nthese figures are not vouched for, and must be very cautiously\r\nreceived, as originating with companies interested pecuniarily in the\r\nstatistics.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, therefore, it may be safely assumed that tornadoes are\r\nnot so destructive to life as thunder-storms.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nProfessor Thomas Russell has formulated a method for prediction of\r\ncold waves. They always occur after \"lows\" and before \"highs,\" and\r\ndifferent cold waves vary in extent from three \"units\" to sixty. A\r\n\"unit\" of temperature-fall is taken as a fall of twenty degrees over\r\nan area of 50,000 square miles.\r\n\r\nThe temperature-fall curves in the United States are approximately\r\nelliptical in shape. Perfect ellipses represent actual temperature\r\nfalls with an error not exceeding six degrees in {52} most cases.\r\nThese fall lines are intersections of planes with a cone which\r\ngraphically represents the totality of temperature-fall, the contents\r\nof the cone being equal to the area of its base multiplied by its\r\naltitude, which is the greatest fall in temperature at the center of\r\nthe cold wave.\r\n\r\nA formula has been devised, based on 127 special cases, representing\r\nthe amount of fall in terms of the amount of barometric depression in\r\na \"low,\" and the amount of excess if a \"high,\" and the density of the\r\nisothermal lines in the region.\r\n\r\nFrom proper consideration of the type of low area, shape of isobars,\r\nand position of the long axis, definite conclusions can be drawn as to\r\nthe subsequent shape of the elliptical twenty-degree temperature-fall\r\narea and its position.\r\n\r\nA method has been devised, also by Professor Russell, for determining\r\nthe maximum fall of temperature at the center of the cold wave. The\r\nmaximum fall and extent of fall being known, from suitably prepared\r\ntables, the area of twenty-degree fall can be derived. Previously\r\nprepared pieces of card-board are laid in the proper position on a map\r\nof suitable scale, and lines drawn around them. Between the line\r\nrepresenting the twenty-degree fall and the center, the other falls of\r\nthirty degrees, forty degrees, etc., are sketched in.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe foregoing sketch of the geography of the air may appear too\r\nsuperficial and limited for the purposes of this Society, but its\r\nfurther elaboration was impracticable. Indeed, the subject of\r\nmeteorology could hardly have been touched upon this year had it not\r\nbeen for the courtesy of Professor Russell in placing at my disposal\r\nnotes upon translations from foreign publications, especially from the\r\nGerman; which publications I have been unable to examine save in a\r\ncasual way.\r\n\r\nThe address, as it is, is submitted only in the hope that it may\r\nserve, if no other purpose, at least to indicate the great interest\r\nwhich now obtains in the geography of the air, and which manifests\r\nitself in the production of meteorological pamphlets and publications\r\ntoo numerous to permit any one charged with important executive duties\r\nto examine them all, even in a non-critical way.",
