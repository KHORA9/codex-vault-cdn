LOUIS\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Trinidad Asphalt Lake, showing the loop of the narrow\r\n    gauge railroad]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: (Illustrated capital)]\r\n\r\nIn the name “Trinidad” is embodied all the romance and beauty and wonder\r\nof a tropical island. In the native language it is called Iere, “the\r\nland of the humming bird.” Quite in accordance with the luxurious\r\nabundance of life and color is the asphalt lake, the marvel of\r\ncenturies. Its causation astonishing, its features gigantic, it lies in\r\nthe heart of a romantic land—a subject of speculation among scientists,\r\nbut a tropical enchantment to those of more fanciful mind.\r\n\r\nThe Island of Trinidad lies about 700 miles north of the Equator and\r\n2000 miles from New York. Its area of 1755 square miles is less than\r\nthat of the State of Delaware. It belongs to Great Britain and is\r\nseparated from its nearest neighbor, Venezuela, by the wonderful Gulf of\r\nParia and its narrow straits or bocas which connect the gulf with the\r\nocean.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: A private mansion, Port of Spain, B. W. I.]\r\n\r\nThis majestic gateway has seen the coming and going of many famous\r\nmariners. Through it Columbus sailed north on his third voyage in\r\nmidsummer of the year 1498. Sir Walter Raleigh and many buccaneers swept\r\nthrough the bocas in the days when English seamen performed deeds of\r\nvalor against the Spaniards, and any galleon was their lawful prey.\r\nHere, too, cruised Nelson with his great English fleet, hunting for the\r\nFrench warships on that half world chase that ended at Trafalgar. To-day\r\nimportant trade centers in Trinidad, and the harbor of Port of Spain,\r\nthe only city of size, is busy with the arrival and departure of\r\nsteamships bearing to Europe and America the tropical riches of the\r\nIsland.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: A country road just outside Port of Spain]\r\n\r\nIn Trinidad the thermometer records 85 degrees almost every day and\r\nnever changes more than twenty degrees. The only difference between one\r\nseason of the year and another, is that for a few months it rains. Even\r\nin the rainy season, however, and nearly every day, there is an\r\nabundance of bright sunshine. There are fine shops, large warehouses\r\nfilled with chocolate beans, sugar and other tropical products; and one\r\ncan ride on trolley cars made in Philadelphia. The most popular hotel\r\nfaces the great Savannah, a wide stretch of lawn bordered by trees.\r\nThere are beautiful drives to the Reservoir; up the mountains to Maracas\r\nWaterfall with vista of the Caribbean a thousand feet below; through\r\navenues of giant bamboos arching over the roadway, and through miles of\r\nplantations of cacao.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Queen’s Park Hotel, the most popular in Port of\r\n    Spain, facing the great Savannah]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: A street in Port of Spain, where one can ride up town\r\n    on a trolley car built in Philadelphia]\r\n\r\nRailway lines run east from Port of Spain, and south for thirty-five\r\nmiles, down the coast of the Gulf of Paria, to Prince’s Town and San\r\nFernando, through sections crowded with East Indian coolies. From San\r\nFernando, a little steamer leaves daily for trips along the coast. The\r\nland-locked waters of the Gulf are usually calm and the mountains of\r\nVenezuela are seen miles away in an exquisite blue haze. The steamer\r\nskirts along a shore bordered by mangrove swamps, to Brighton, and there\r\nit stops at the long pier of The Trinidad Lake Asphalt Operating\r\nCompany, Ltd.\r\n\r\nBrighton is an active little industrial community, close upon the lake,\r\nand the traveler finds himself in the midst of the asphalt industry.\r\nOverhead the cable is singing away as it carries along the myriad of\r\ngreat buckets filled with asphalt. Dozens of pretty buildings are the\r\nhomes of the Company’s employees. White paint and screens and\r\ncleanliness are everywhere.\r\n\r\nThe asphalt refinery is at the hilltop, on the border of the lake, which\r\nhas been described by some as an inferno, a place of heat and vapors. In\r\nreality it is a great level area of about 100 acres, with a surface of a\r\ndull blue-gray color, with here and there stray pools of water from the\r\nshowers.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: The great Savannah, with its wide, tree-bordered\r\n    lawn, rich in tropical beauty]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Model of Trinidad Asphalt Lake, Brighton, Trinidad,\r\n    British West Indies\r\n\r\n    At the lower right-hand corner of the photograph of the model will\r\n    be found the village of La Brea, while just above at the edge of the\r\n    lake is the village of “New Jersey,” where the laborers and their\r\n    families live. The asphalt refinery and barreling plant are to the\r\n    left of the village. The office, bungalows of the employees, hotel\r\n    and clubhouse are located between the refinery and the loading pier.\r\n    At the extreme left-hand corner of the photograph is the jetty and\r\n    end of aerial tramway, where vessels dock to be loaded with\r\n    asphalt.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Part of the Company’s “Quarters” for employees at\r\n    Trinidad Asphalt Lake]\r\n\r\nYou may walk where you please on the asphalt. It is solid enough to bear\r\nyour weight. But if you stand in one place you will slowly sink in. The\r\nsurface bears some resemblance to an asphalt street on a very hot day,\r\nthough much of the time a fresh breeze blows.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: A gang of workmen on the lake, digging and loading\r\n    asphalt.\r\n    Observe the method of carrying to cars]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Another view of the asphalt lake showing workmen at\r\n    rest during lunch period]\r\n\r\nA narrow gauge railroad runs from the refinery out upon and halfway\r\nacross the lake. Then it swings back in a great loop to the shore.\r\nLittle cars run on the tracks drawn by a wire cable guided by rollers\r\nbetween the rails. Here and there, near the line, you may see workmen\r\ndigging asphalt and loading trains of cars. When these are filled they\r\nare drawn around the loop to the refinery; or to the pier where asphalt\r\nin its crude form is shipped to the United States and to nearly every\r\nother civilized country in the world.\r\n\r\nThe loaded cars are halted under a conveyor cable. Very rapidly the\r\nhooks which swing from the cable are thrown into place, and the big\r\nbucket is lifted from the truck and goes off down the hill. The carriers\r\nare clamped to the moving cable, all the buckets moving along at the\r\nsame rate of speed. The weight of those going down helps to pull the\r\nempties back again, so that not very much power is needed to keep the\r\ncable moving.\r\n\r\nMost of the cars, however, are stopped at the refinery, which is at the\r\nedge of the lake, close to the power house and the shops. Refining\r\nTrinidad asphalt consists mainly of driving off twenty-nine per cent. of\r\ncontained water. The crude asphalt is dumped into large tanks heated by\r\ncoils of steam pipes. The asphalt softens and boils, evaporating the\r\nwater completely. The melted asphalt is drawn into barrels, in which it\r\nis shipped away. This refined Trinidad Lake Asphalt contains all of the\r\nconstituents of the crude asphalt that are valuable from the chemical or\r\ncommercial viewpoint.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Panoramic view of Trinidad Asphalt Lake. The lake\r\n    occupies a bowl-like depression, in area about 114 acres. It is\r\n    bordered by low hills. The surface is dotted with clumps of trees\r\n    and bushes, and broken by irregular pools of surface water. In the\r\n    background to the left is part of the asphalt refinery, which\r\n    extends from the hilltop to the edge of the lake]\r\n\r\nDigging the asphalt is a simple operation. A mattock is the only tool\r\nrequired, and under its blows the asphalt breaks readily. The negroes\r\nemployed in digging are skilled in the work, and break out lumps that\r\nwould be far too heavy for an untrained laborer to carry. An\r\nastonishingly small amount of the material is broken into pieces. A\r\nlaborer simply lifts one or two lumps, raises them up on his head, walks\r\na few yards, and drops them in the car. The crude asphalt as broken out\r\nis brownish, usually quite wet with surface water, and filled with\r\ncavities made by gas up to an inch or more in diameter.\r\n\r\nThe gangs of barefooted workmen in a place number thirty, of whom half a\r\ndozen do the digging on a space perhaps sixty feet long and forty wide,\r\nand in the course of a day dig to a depth of about three feet. That same\r\nspot the next morning may look a little rough but will be approximately\r\nlevel with the level of the lake. The hole fills up, and in the course\r\nof a week all traces of the digging are obliterated, which does not mean\r\nnecessarily that fresh asphalt has come into the lake from below. On the\r\ncontrary, the excavations are filled by a slow settling or leveling of\r\nthe surface asphalt. Near the middle of the area the material is softer,\r\nand in a few places it may be seen in small irregular patches oozing up\r\nfrom below, and of the consistency of putty.\r\n\r\nThe Lake is solid asphalt, perhaps two hundred feet deep at its lowest\r\npoint. Borings show that in consistency the asphalt is practically the\r\nsame throughout. There is evidence that the mass contained in the lake\r\nis in constant but very slow motion. The surface is a series of folds,\r\nbetween which rain water gathers in the creases. Sir Frederick Treves\r\ncompared the surface of the asphalt to the skin of a huge elephant, and\r\nthe irregular creases to the folds in his hide. Along the edges of the\r\npools of water, grass and bushes find a footing, forming green islands\r\nof no great area.\r\n\r\nThe railroad which carries the asphalt to the refinery is necessarily a\r\nlight affair, for the reason that it is frequently moved from place to\r\nplace, as mining work is shifted. It is remarkable, however, how the\r\nasphalt supports the ties and rails, especially when it is remembered\r\nthat the loaded cars often passing in a continuous line over the rails,\r\nmust weigh no less than 1000 pounds each. A solid lake may seem a\r\nmisnomer, but no other phrase better describes the Trinidad deposit or\r\nthe somewhat similar but much larger Bermudez asphalt lake in Venezuela.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Surface of the lake, a series of great folds, where\r\n    rain water gathers in the creases]\r\n\r\nClose to the Lake’s edge the asphalt is drier, and along the shore of\r\nthe lake here and there are “pitch cones,” like miniature volcanoes, and\r\ncomposed of asphalt that does not flow, but which was evidently once\r\nsemi-liquid. Similar “pitch cones” are to be found here and there about\r\nthe neighborhood, and are in places along the edge of the Gulf of Paria.\r\n\r\nA quarter of a mile from shore a steamship lies at the end of the pier,\r\nloading crude asphalt. Go out on the narrow boardwalk, climb up the\r\nwinding stairway, and you come on a platform forty feet above the water.\r\nThe conveyor cable is guided by pulleys around the end of the pier. As\r\neach bucket comes along a clutch is thrown off, the bucket is tipped and\r\nthe asphalt falls down a chute into the hold of the ship.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Breaking the asphalt with a mattock. The porous\r\n    condition of the lumps can be seen]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: “Pitch cones” of hard asphalt at the edge of the\r\n    lake]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: A near view of the surface of the lake. Gas emerging\r\n    through surface water, as shown by ripples and bubbles]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Uncovering land asphalt.

Men throwing off\r\n    the clutch.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: The next step—Men releasing the pawl preparatory to\r\n    emptying the large bucket.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: The bucket is tipped up and the asphalt goes tumbling\r\n    through a hole in the platform, down a chute into the hold of the\r\n    ship.]\r\n\r\nThe origin of asphalt has been a subject of much discussion in the past,\r\nand recent developments in the region of the lake enable one at last to\r\nmake a definite statement on the subject. Strata of clays and shales\r\nthat extend from east to west in southern Trinidad, carry asphaltic oil\r\nin liquid form. Many wells have been drilled in recent years and\r\nquantities of this maltha won. The asphalt lake fills a natural\r\ndepression into which asphaltic petroleum from one of these strata found\r\nits way ages ago.\r\n\r\nA geologist might say that the origin of the deposit of asphalt is\r\nrecent, but in saying that he might mean that not more than a few\r\nthousand years had gone since its occurrence. The asphaltic petroleum\r\ncame from the depths, after which such parts of the substance as were\r\nlight and gaseous volatilized, the heavy base remaining.\r\n\r\nFor practical purposes the asphalt is a perfect commodity for the uses\r\nto which it is applied. The amount in the lake has not been calculated\r\nwith any certainty, but there is unquestionably enough to supply the\r\nneeds of the whole world for a very long time.\r\n\r\nThe first modern Trinidad Lake asphalt pavement was laid in the United\r\nStates. Since then it has been used on show streets of the world,\r\nincluding Fifth Avenue, New York; Pennsylvania Avenue, Washington, D.\r\nC.; Michigan Avenue Boulevard, Chicago; Broad Street, Philadelphia;\r\nVictoria-Thames Embankment, London, England, and countless other streets\r\nin the United States, South America, Australia, Egypt, India and Japan.\r\nOne very frequently now sees motor trucks hauling mixtures of this black\r\nmaterial. Almost everybody has seen it dumped smoking hot on the street,\r\npaused to watch the men raking it out carefully and the rollers\r\ncompressing it into a smooth pavement. As laid it contains 10% of\r\nasphalt and the rest is sand and stone-dust.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Upper Illustration—Wells, derricks, and partial view\r\n    of Oil Refinery\r\n    Lower Illustration—A well in operation, with oil running into “sump”\r\n    shown in foreground]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the asphalt has such cementitious qualities that it\r\nsolidifies the materials into a sheet as hard as rock.\r\n\r\nAfter asphalt was first used for street paving, other uses were\r\ndiscovered for it. For example, it is now used in the manufacture of\r\nasphalt shingles and roll roofings. Asphalt is waterproof and at the\r\nsame time so tough and durable that it is peculiarly suited for that\r\npurpose. These qualities combined with its low price have no doubt been\r\nmainly responsible for its phenomenal success and popularity among\r\nbuilders and home owners.\r\n\r\nThe earlier forms of roll roofing were supplemented very soon by more\r\nelaborate styles coated with granulated slate in different colors and\r\ncut into shingles in a wide variety of sizes and patterns.\r\n\r\nHundreds of tons of native lake asphalt are used annually in the\r\nconstruction of built-up roofs and asphalt mastic floors for large\r\noffice buildings and industrial plants. A large amount of asphalt is\r\nalso used in the waterproofing of large engineering projects, such as\r\ntunnels, bridge structures, dams and reservoirs.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: A grove of cocoanut trees and tropical undergrowth at\r\n    edge of Trinidad Asphalt Lake]\r\n\r\n  Duplicate copies of this Booklet may be obtained free of charge from\r\n  The Barber Asphalt Company, Philadelphia, Pa.\r\n\r\n                             Cable Address—\r\n                         Baspaco, Philadelphia\r\n\r\n                            ELEVENTH EDITION\r\n                                  3-27\r\n\r\n                                50M 3-27\r\n                        Lasher Printing Company\r\n                         Philadelphia, U.
