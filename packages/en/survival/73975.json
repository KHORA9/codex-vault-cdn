As all these students had\r\npreliminary training in physics, chemistry and botany, no introductory\r\nchapters on these general subjects were necessary or contemplated; the\r\nmore so as good elementary treatises embracing the needful preparation\r\nare now numerous.\r\n\r\nAs time progressed, however, outside demands for a book embodying the\r\nwriter’s soil studies in the humid and arid regions, especially the\r\nlatter, became so numerous and pressing that the scope of the work has\r\ngradually been much enlarged to conform to these demands; and this,\r\nrather than completeness of detail, when such detail can be found well\r\ngiven elsewhere, has been the guide in the necessary condensation of\r\nthe whole. To give the entire subject matter full elucidation, would\r\nrequire several more volumes.\r\n\r\nIt may not be unnecessary to explain at the outset why and how this\r\ntreatise deviates in many respects from previous publications on the\r\nsame general topic. From boyhood up it has fallen to the writer’s lot\r\nto be almost continuously in more or less direct contact with the\r\nconditions and requirements of newly settled regions, as well as with\r\nthose hardly yet invaded even by the pioneer farmer; where the question\r\nof cultural adaptation was yet undetermined or wholly in the dark.\r\nBeing during his active life constantly called upon in his official\r\ncapacity to give information and advice to pioneer farmers or intending\r\nsettlers in regard to the merits and adaptations of virgin soils, the\r\nwriter’s attention was naturally and forcibly directed toward soil\r\ninvestigation as a possible means of determining, beforehand, the\r\ngeneral prospects and special features of agriculture in regions where\r\nactual experience was either non-existent or very brief and partial.\r\nIn the pursuit of these studies he has been favored by exceptional\r\nopportunities, extending over a varied climatic area reaching on the\r\nsouth from the Gulf of Mexico to the Ohio, across to the Pacific coast,\r\nand to British Columbia on the north. That a systematic investigation\r\nof soils over so large an area, covering both humid and arid regions,\r\nshould lead to some unexpected and novel results, is but natural; and\r\nit is the discussion of these results in connection with those obtained\r\nelsewhere, and with some of the prevailing views based thereon, that\r\nmust serve as the justification for the present addition to an already\r\nwell-stocked branch of literature.\r\n\r\nFrom the very beginning of the scientific study of agriculture, the\r\ninvestigation of soils with a view to the _à priori_ determination\r\nof their adaptation, permanent value, and best means of cultural\r\nimprovement, has formed the subject of continuous effort. It is not\r\neasy to imagine a subject of higher direct importance to the physical\r\nwelfare of mankind, whose very existence depends on the yearly returns\r\ndrawn by cultural labor from the soil.\r\n\r\nIt is certainly remarkable that after all this long-continued effort,\r\neven the fundamental principles, and still more the methods by which\r\nthe object in view is to be attained, are still so far in dispute that\r\na unification of opinion in this respect is not yet in view; and a\r\nreturn to pure empiricism is from time to time brought forward to cut\r\nthe Gordian knot.\r\n\r\nWhile this state of things is primarily due to the intrinsic complexity\r\nand difficulty of the subject itself, it has unquestionably been\r\nmaterially aggravated by accidental, partly historic conditions.\r\nForemost among these is the fact that until within recent times, soil\r\nstudies have borne almost entirely on lands long cultivated and in most\r\ncases fertilized: thus changing them from their natural condition to a\r\nmore or less artificial one, which obscures the natural relations of\r\neach soil to vegetation.\r\n\r\nThe importance of these relations is obvious, both from the theoretical\r\nand from the practical standpoint. From the former, it is clear that\r\nthe native vegetation represents, within the climatic limits of the\r\nregional flora, the result of a secular process of adaptation of plants\r\nto climates and soils, by natural selection and the survival of the\r\nfittest. The natural floras and sylvas are thus the expression of\r\nsecular, or rather, millennial experience, which if rightly interpreted\r\nmust convey to the cultivator of the soil the same information that\r\notherwise he must acquire by long and costly personal experience.\r\n\r\nThe general correctness of this axiom is almost self-evident; it is\r\nexplicitly recognized in the universal practice of settlers in new\r\nregions, of selecting lands in accordance with the character of the\r\nforest growth thereon; it is even legally recognized by the valuation\r\nof lands upon the same basis, for purposes of assessment, as is\r\npracticed in a number of States.\r\n\r\nThe accuracy with which experienced farmers judge of the quality of\r\ntimbered lands by their forest growth, has justly excited the wonder\r\nand envy of agricultural investigators, whose researches, based upon\r\nincomplete theoretical assumptions, failed to convey to them any such\r\npractical insight. It was doubtless this state of the case that led a\r\ndistinguished writer on agriculture to remark, nearly half a century\r\nago, that he “would rather trust an old farmer for his judgment of land\r\nthan the best chemist alive.”[1]\r\n\r\n[1] “The Soil Analyses of the Geological Surveys of Kentucky and\r\nArkansas.” S. W. Johnson in _Am. Jour. Sci._, Sept. 1861.\r\n\r\nIt is certainly true that mere physico-chemical analyses, unassisted\r\nby other data, will frequently lead to a wholly erroneous estimate of\r\na soil’s agricultural value, when applied to cultivated lands. But\r\nthe matter assumes a very different aspect when, with the natural\r\nvegetation and the corresponding cultural experience as guides, we seek\r\nfor the factors upon which the observed natural selection of plants\r\ndepends, by the physical and chemical examination of the respective\r\nsoils. It is further obvious that, these factors being once known, we\r\nshall be justified in applying them to those cases in which the guiding\r\nmark of native vegetation is absent, as the result of causes that have\r\nnot materially altered the natural condition of the soil.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that, had agricultural science been first developed\r\nin regions where the external conditions permitted the carrying-out\r\nof such a course of investigation, instead of in the abnormally\r\ntemperate, even and humid climate of middle Europe, with its\r\nlong-cropped, worn fields, and very predominantly calcareous soils,\r\nthe present condition of this science might differ not immaterially\r\nfrom that actually existing. As a matter of fact, it has attained\r\nits present state under very disadvantageous external conditions,\r\nwhich frequently necessitated a recourse to highly complex and\r\nlaborious methods and artificial appliances, for the establishment and\r\nmaintenance of the conditions which elsewhere might have been found\r\nabundantly realized in nature; thus permitting, by the multiplication\r\nof observations over extended and widely varied areas, the elimination\r\nand control of accidental errors of experiment and observation.\r\n\r\nJust as in historical geology the subdivisions of formations observed\r\nand accepted in Europe formed for many years a procrustean bed upon\r\nwhich the facts observed elsewhere had to be stretched, so in the\r\ndomain of soil physics and chemistry, and even in vegetable physiology,\r\nthe observations made in the really exceptional climates and soils\r\nof middle Western Europe, have often erroneously been construed as\r\nconstituting a general basis for unalterable deductions.\r\n\r\nThe rapid extension of civilization and the carrying of minute\r\nscientific research into other regions, now rendered possible by the\r\nimproved means of communication, has shown the one-sidedness of some of\r\nthe views prevailing heretofore, inasmuch as they are really applicable\r\nonly to accidental and rather exceptional conditions.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore one object of this volume to present and discuss\r\nsummarily the facts of physical and chemical soil constitution and\r\nfunctions with reference to the additional light afforded on the wider\r\nbasis, embracing both the humid and the arid regions; of which the\r\nlatter has, as such, received but scant and desultory attention thus\r\nfar, to the detriment of both the work of the agricultural experiment\r\nstations and of agricultural practice. The book therefore includes the\r\ndiscussion both of the methods and results of direct physical, chemical\r\nand botanical soil investigation, as well as the subject matter\r\nrelating to the origin, formation, classification and physical as well\r\nas chemical nature of soil, usually included in works on scientific\r\nagriculture.\r\n\r\nIn the presentation of these subjects, it has been the writer’s aim\r\nto reach both the students in his own classes and in the agricultural\r\ncolleges generally, as well as the fast increasing class of farmers of\r\nboth regions who are willing and even anxious to avail themselves of\r\nthe results and principles of scientific investigation, without “shying\r\noff” from the new or unfamiliar words necessary to embody new ideas. It\r\nwould seem to be time that the latter class, and more especially those\r\nconstituting farmers’ clubs, should learn to understand and appreciate\r\nboth the terms and methods of scientific reasoning, which are likely to\r\nform, increasingly, the subjects of instruction in the public schools.\r\nBut in order to segregate to some extent the generally intelligible\r\nmatter from that which requires more scientific preparation than can\r\nnow be generally expected, it has been thought best to use in the text\r\ntwo kinds of type; the larger one embodying the matter presumed to be\r\ninteresting and intelligible to the general reader, while the smaller\r\ntype carries the illustrative detail and discussion which will be\r\nsought chiefly by the student.\r\n\r\nAs regards the chemical nomenclature used in this volume, the writer\r\nhas not thought it advisable to follow the example set by some late\r\nauthors in substituting for the well-known names of the bases and\r\nacids, those of the elements, and still less, those of the intangible\r\nions. Any one who has taught classes in agricultural chemistry will\r\nhave experienced the difficulty and loss of time unnecessarily incurred\r\nin the incessantly recurring transposition of terms, and complication\r\nof formulæ, serving no useful purpose save that of academic\r\nconsistency. It is of at least doubtful utility to present to the\r\nfarmer, _e. g._, the inflammable and dangerous elements phosphorus and\r\npotassium as prime factors in the success of his crops, and of healthy\r\nnutrition.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as all the elements are presented to and contained in the\r\nplant in compounds only, and these compounds are themselves, in the\r\ndilute solutions used by plants, known to be largely dissociated into\r\ntheir basic and acid groups, it seems to be most natural to present\r\nthem under the corresponding, even if not absolutely theoretically\r\ncorrect names of acids and bases, to which the farmer and the trade\r\nhave been accustomed for half a century. Upon these considerations the\r\nlong-used designations of potash, soda, lime, phosphoric, sulfuric,\r\nnitric and other acids and bases have been retained in this volume,\r\nadding the chemical formula where, as in analytical statements, a doubt\r\nas to their meaning might arise. Assuredly, the diffusion of scientific\r\nknowledge should not be needlessly hindered by the adoption of a\r\npedantic mode of presentation.\r\n\r\nThe great breadth of the subject of this volume has rendered\r\ninadvisable any extended bibliography, such as it has of late become\r\ncustomary to add to works of this kind. References have therefore been\r\nrestricted to publications specially discussed, and to such as are not\r\nwidely known on account of limited circulation.\r\n\r\nThe author’s warmest acknowledgments are due to Professor R. H.\r\nLoughridge, of the University of California, for efficient and\r\nsympathetic assistance, both in the revision of the manuscript, and\r\nactive personal help in the preparation of the illustrations. Without\r\nhis coöperation the preparation and publication of the volume would\r\nhave been much longer delayed.\r\n\r\nAcknowledgments are also due for helpful suggestions and criticism\r\nto Professors L. H. Bailey, of Cornell University, F. H. King, of\r\nWisconsin, and Jacques Loeb of the University of California.\r\n\r\n                                               E. W.

Soils form the uppermost layer of the\r\nearth’s crust; but the term does not indicate any such definite average\r\ntexture as is sometimes implied by its popular use to designate certain\r\nloose, loamy materials found in older geological formations. We do find\r\nin these, not unfrequently, layers that in the past have served to\r\nsupport vegetation, as evidenced by remains of plants found therein.\r\nBut as a rule, such ancient soils are much compacted and otherwise\r\nchanged, and would not now be capable of performing the office of\r\nplant nutrition without previous, long-continued exposure to the same\r\nagencies by which all soils were originally formed from pre-existing\r\nrocks. Within the latter category must be included, in scientific\r\nparlance, not only the hard rocks known as such in daily life, but also\r\nsuch soft materials as clay, sand, marls, etc., which often compose,\r\npartially or wholly, the bodies of wide-spread geological formations.\r\n\r\n_Elements Constituting the Earth’s Crust._—More than seventy elementary\r\nsubstances have been found within the portion of the earth accessible\r\nto man; most of these are present only in very minute proportions; of\r\nthose occurring in relatively considerable quantities, a list showing\r\ntheir approximate proportions is given below.\r\n\r\n_Average quantitative composition of the Earth’s Crust._—The total\r\nthickness of the outer shell of the earth, thus far known to us, does\r\nnot exceed about 95,000 feet, as observed in the accessible rock\r\ndeposits. Estimates of the proportions in which the more abundant\r\nelements contribute to the composition of these constituent rocks, have\r\nrepeatedly been made. The latest and most widely accepted of these, by\r\nF. W. Clarke, of the U. S. Geological Survey, is given herewith. It\r\nincludes the constituents of the sea and atmosphere as well; these two\r\nconstitute about 7 per cent of the whole, 93 per cent being solid rocks.\r\n\r\n    RELATIVE ABUNDANCE OF THE ELEMENTS TO A DEPTH OF TEN KILOMETERS.\r\n\r\n                 SOLID CRUST       OCEAN           MEAN,\r\n                (93 PER CENT).

S.

While quartz occurs alone\r\nin enormous masses, as will be shown later, probably the greater\r\nproportion is found in combination with other oxids, notably those of\r\naluminum, calcium, iron, magnesium, and the alkali metals potassium and\r\nsodium. Chlorin and fluorin, however, do not occur as oxids.[3]\r\n\r\n[3] A trifling amount of chlorin is found oxidized in the form of\r\nsodium perchlorate, in the nitre deposits of Chile.\r\n\r\n_The Chemical Elements Important to Agriculture._—Of the numerous\r\nelements known to chemists, only eighteen require mention in connection\r\nwith either soil formation or plant growth; and of these only thirteen\r\nor fourteen participate in normal plant growth. They are the following:\r\n\r\n    METALLIC ELEMENTS.    NON-METALLIC ELEMENTS.\r\n\r\n    Potassium               Carbon\r\n    Sodium                  Hydrogen\r\n    Calcium                 Oxygen\r\n    Magnesium               Nitrogen\r\n    Iron                    Phosphorus\r\n    Manganese               Sulphur\r\n    Aluminum                Chlorin\r\n    Titanium                Fluorin\r\n                            Iodin\r\n                            Silicon.\r\n\r\nOf this list, titanium, though a very constant ingredient of soils in\r\nthe form of titanic dioxid, is not known as performing any important\r\nfunction in soils, and is not, so far as known at present, ever taken\r\nup by plants. Aluminum, in the form of its compounds with oxygen\r\nand silicon, is a very prominent and physically very important soil\r\ningredient, but does not, apparently, perform any direct function in\r\nplant nutrition, and is absent from their ash, except in the case of\r\nsome of the lower plants (horsetails and ferns).\r\n\r\nIodin appears to be normally present in all seaweeds, and occurs in\r\ntraces in some land plants. Fluorin is a normal ingredient of animal\r\nbones, and its presence in plant ashes is often easily shown. The\r\nremaining fourteen, however, are always present in plants; carbon,\r\nhydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen forming the volatile or combustible part,\r\nwhile the rest occur in the ashes.\r\n\r\nIt is true that other elements, or rather their compounds, are\r\nsometimes found in plants, being taken up by them from solutions\r\nexisting in the soil. Thus the alkalies caesium and rubidium, also\r\nbarium, strontium, zinc, copper, boron and some others, may be absorbed\r\nwhen present in soluble form. But they are neither necessary nor\r\nbeneficial to plant economy, and when in considerable amounts are\r\nharmful. Thus fifteen elements, ommiting iodin and titanium, alone\r\nrequire discussion.\r\n\r\n_The Volatile Part of Plants_, as already stated, consists of carbon,\r\nhydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen. Of these, carbon is obtained by the\r\nplant exclusively from the carbonic (dioxid) gas of the air; hydrogen\r\nand oxygen, from the soil in the form of water; nitrogen, directly\r\nfrom the soil but indirectly also from the air, through the agency of\r\ncertain bacteria. The _ash ingredients_ of course are all derived from\r\nthe soil through the roots, and must all be present in the latter in\r\nan available form, to a sufficient extent to supply the demands of\r\nvegetation.\r\n\r\n_The Agencies of Soil Formation._—With respect to their mode of\r\nformation, soils may be defined as the residual product of the physical\r\ndisintegration and chemical decomposition of rocks; with, ordinarily,\r\na small proportion of the remnants of organic life. The agencies\r\nproducing these changes are those classed under the general term\r\n“atmospheric” or “meteorological;” they include therefore the action\r\nof _temperature_—heat and cold—that of _water_, and that of _air and\r\nits ingredients_. In popular parlance, it includes the processes of\r\n_weathering_; nearly the same processes are involved in the “fallowing”\r\nof soils.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I.\r\n\r\nTHE ORIGIN AND FORMATION OF SOILS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nTHE PHYSICAL PROCESSES OF SOIL FORMATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the physical and mechanical effects of the agencies mentioned\r\nabove usually precede, in time, the chemical changes, which are\r\nmaterially facilitated by the previous pulverization of the rocks, the\r\nformer should be first considered.\r\n\r\n_Effects of heat and cold on rocks._—Most rocks are aggregates of\r\nseveral simple minerals; a few only (limestone, quartzite and a few\r\nothers) expand or contract alike in all their parts. Of the minerals\r\ncomposing the compound rocks, scarcely any expand to exactly the same\r\nextent under the influence of the sun’s heat, especially when their\r\ncolors differ; nor, in the great majority of cases, does one and the\r\nsame mineral expand alike in all three directions. It follows that at\r\neach change of temperature there is a tendency to the formation of\r\nminute fissures between adjacent crystals or masses of different simple\r\nminerals; and especially in the case of large crystals of certain\r\nkinds, this action alone will gradually result in the disruption of the\r\nrock surface, so that individual crystals may be detached with little\r\ndifficulty. In any case, the cracks so formed are gradually widened\r\nby a frequent repetition of the changes of temperature, coupled with\r\naccess of air, water, dust, and the rootlets of plants; all of which\r\nbrings about a gradually increasing rate of surface crumbling. This is\r\nespecially conspicuous at the higher elevations of mountains, where the\r\ntemperature changes are very great and abrupt; and also in the clear\r\natmosphere of deserts, where owing to the extent and suddenness of\r\ntemperature-changes between day and night, caused by the free radiation\r\nof heat into the clear sky, even homogeneous pebbles are known to be\r\nalmost explosively disrupted in the mornings and evenings of clear\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nSuch effects may often be strikingly observed on small surfaces of\r\ncompound crystalline rocks, such as granite, exposed on glaciers, where\r\nthe daily changes of temperature are often extreme, viz., from below\r\nthe freezing point to as much as 130 degrees Fahr. (54.4 degrees C). In\r\nsuch cases one may sometimes scoop off the disintegrated rock by the\r\nhandful, while yet the mineral surfaces are almost perfectly fresh.\r\n\r\nOn a larger scale, the disruption and scaling off of huge slabs of\r\ngranite, and rocks of similar structure, may be observed in southern\r\nCalifornia on the southwestern side of rock exposures, where slabs\r\nfrom a few inches to ten and more feet in length and eight or ten\r\ninches thick, have slid off, perhaps still leaning against the parent\r\nrock, which has been rounded off by a succession of such events into\r\nthe domelike form so characteristic of granite mountains. Merrill[4]\r\nreports similar exfoliations to occur especially on the peninsula of\r\nCalifornia, on Stone Mountain in Georgia, and elsewhere.\r\n\r\n[4] See Rocks, Rock-weathering, and Soils, page 246; also paper on\r\nDomes and Dome Structure, by G. K. Gilbert, in Bulletins of the Geol.\r\nSociety Am., Vol. 15, pp. 29-36.\r\n\r\nA striking exemplification of the effects of frequent and rapid changes\r\nof temperature on rocks, and of humid and dry climates as well, is seen\r\nin the case of the great monoliths of Egypt, one of which now stands in\r\nthe Central Park, New York. In the quarries of Syene in Upper Egypt,\r\nwhere most of these monoliths were obtained, the rough blocks that\r\nwere in progress of quarrying when the work was abandoned, quite two\r\nthousand years ago, still show an almost perfectly fresh surface; and\r\nthe same is true of the finished obelisks in Lower Egypt, where both\r\nthe changes of temperature and the rainfall are somewhat greater. It\r\nis a matter of public note that one of “Cleopatra’s Needles” which was\r\nset up in Central Park nearly thirty years ago, but originally erected\r\nat Heliopolis on the Nile, is in great danger of destruction from the\r\ninfluence of a totally different climate, in which both the temperature\r\nchanges and the rainfall are much more frequent and severe than in\r\nEgypt. The large crystals of feldspar and quartz which compose the\r\n(syenite) rock material have had fine fissures formed between them by\r\noften-repeated expansion and contraction; which when filled with water\r\nand subsequently changed to ice, the latter’s expansion in freezing\r\n(see below) has still farther enlarged them and caused a scaling-off,\r\nwhich threatens to obliterate the hieroglyphic inscriptions. Thus\r\ntemperature-changes and a rain followed by freezing may in a few days\r\nproduce a greater effect than a thousand years of Egyptian climate.\r\n\r\n_Cleavage of rocks._—Many kinds of rocks have definite directions\r\nof ready cleavage. The most common and obvious cases of this kind\r\nare schists, slates and shales, cleaving readily into plates or\r\nirregular flat or lens-shaped fragments. Such structure greatly favors\r\ndisintegration, especially when the layers are on edge at steep\r\nangles. But there are other apparently structureless, massive rocks,\r\nparticularly basalts and other eruptive rocks related to them, as well\r\nas many sandstones and claystones, that have a strong tendency to\r\ncleave into more or less definite forms when struck; such as columns\r\nor prisms, square, six-sided or diamond-shaped blocks, etc. Similar\r\nforms are naturally produced in them under the influence of changes\r\nof temperature; by the formation of minute cracks at first, then\r\nenlargement of these by the several agencies already mentioned.\r\n\r\n_Effects of freezing water._—The irresistible force exerted by the\r\nexpansion of water in freezing, amounting to about 9 per cent of its\r\nbulk, is a powerful factor in widening and deepening fissures and\r\ncracks of rocks; not uncommonly, whole masses of rock are rent into\r\nfragments by this agency, which is one of the most common causes of\r\n“rock falls” on the brink of precipices. By the freezing process cracks\r\nand crevices are enlarged, and the surfaces exposed to weathering are\r\nstill farther increased; and the rock fragments or soil particles are\r\nloosened and rendered more liable to be removed from the original site,\r\nwhether by gravity, wind or water.\r\n\r\n_Glaciers._—Ice in the form of the glaciers that descend from mountain\r\nchains (see figure 1), and of the moving ice sheets that have covered\r\nlarge portions of North America and Europe in past ages and now cover\r\nGreenland and the South Polar continent, exerts a most potent action\r\nin abrading and grinding even the hardest rocks; not so much by the\r\ndirect friction of the moving ice itself, as by the cutting, scoring,\r\ngrinding and crushing action which the stones imbedded in the ice,\r\nor carried and shoved by it, exert upon the rocky channels in which\r\nthe ice stream moves, as well as upon each other. The product of this\r\ngrinding process is largely very fine (hence “glacier flour”), so that\r\nit remains suspended in the water of the glacier-streams until their\r\nvelocity is permanently checked when reaching a plain or lake. This\r\nsuspended stone-flour imparts to the glacier streams their distinctive\r\ncharacter of “white rivers,” as contradistinguished from the clear,\r\ndark “green rivers” that have their origin outside of glaciated areas.\r\nThis difference can be readily observed in traveling along any of\r\nthe glacier-bearing mountain chains of the world, and is frequently\r\nexpressed in the names of the streams.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.—Zermatt Glacier (Agassiz).]\r\n\r\nThe physical analysis of mud from the foot of Muir glacier,[5] Alaska,\r\nat its sea front, made by Professor Loughridge, shows the prevalent\r\nfineness of the materials brought down by the glacier waters.\r\n\r\n[5] Collected by Dr. W.

The great and lasting fertility of the soils\r\nof southern Sweden is traced directly to this mode of origin, and\r\ndoubtless the great American ice sheet of glacier times is similarly\r\nconcerned in the high quality of the soil of our “north central”\r\nstates, from the Ohio to the Great Lakes and the Missouri.\r\n\r\nThe accumulations of rocks and debris of all sizes in the “moraines”\r\nor detrital deposits of glaciers and ice-sheets form another class of\r\nglacier-made lands which cover extensive and important agricultural\r\nareas (drift areas), both in the old and new worlds. Such lands are\r\nundulating or slightly hilly, and the soil usually contains imbedded\r\nin it stones of a great variety of kinds and sizes, partly angular,\r\npartly rounded and polished by friction. Of course the frequent and\r\nviolent changes of temperature occurring on the surface of a glacier,\r\naid materially in reducing the rocks carried by it to the condition in\r\nwhich we find the material of the moraines; which commonly form lateral\r\nor cross ridges in valleys formerly occupied by glaciers.\r\n\r\n_Action of flowing water._—The action of flowing water is doubtless at\r\nthis time the most potent mechanical agency of soil formation. From the\r\nsculpturing of the original simple forms in which geological agencies\r\nleft the earth’s surface into the complex ones of modern mountain\r\nchains, to the formation of valleys, plains, and basins out of the\r\nmaterials so carried away, its effects are prodigious. The torrents\r\nand streams in carrying silt, sand, gravel and bowlders, according to\r\nvelocity and volume, do not merely displace these materials; the rock\r\nfragments of all sizes not only score and abrade the bed of the rill\r\nor stream, but by their mutual attrition produce more or less of fine\r\npowder similar to that formed by glacier action; usually more mixed in\r\nits ingredients than the former, because derived from a wider range of\r\ndrainage surface. In the glacier stream itself, it is easy to trace the\r\ngradual transition from the sharp stone fragments lying in the water as\r\nit issues from the terminal ice cave at the lower end of the glacier,\r\nto the rounded shingle found a few miles below.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.—Erosion of Hawaiian Hills, near Honolulu. (Phot.\r\nby H. C. Myers.)]\r\n\r\nOn slopes where water flows only during rain or the melting of\r\nsnow, the same erosive effects may be seen as between the heads of\r\nravines and their outlets. (See figure 2,) It is there too that\r\nthe surprisingly rapid cutting-out of channels by the aid of water\r\ncharged with rock fragments or gravel, can readily be observed, and\r\nthe enormous power of water erosion convincingly shown. In the United\r\nStates the stupendous gorges of the Columbia and Colorado rivers,\r\nthe former cut to a depth of over 2000 feet into hard basalt rock,\r\nthe latter to over 5,000 feet, partly into softer materials, partly\r\ninto granite, are perhaps the most striking examples of this power;\r\nthe manifestations of which can, however, be as convincingly seen in\r\nthousands of minor rivers and streams.\r\n\r\nAll the materials so carried off from the higher slopes are finally\r\ndeposited on a lower level; whether only a short distance away on a\r\nlower slope (colluvial soils), or farther away in the flood plain of\r\nstreams, rivers, or lakes (alluvial soils). Other things being equal,\r\nthe finest materials are of course, carried farthest, and often into\r\nthe sea; in which, however, they cannot long remain suspended, but are\r\nquickly thrown down, forming river bars, flood plains, and deltas. The\r\nfineness of the material of delta soils, like that of those made from\r\nglacier flour, insures them the same advantage, viz. great fertility\r\nand durability.\r\n\r\nIt is calculated that the Mississippi River carries into the Gulf of\r\nMexico annually some 7469 millions of cubic feet of earthy deposits,\r\nwhich would fill one square mile of surface to the height of 268 feet,\r\nor would cover that number of square miles to the depth of one foot.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.—Cliffs and caves on sea-beach at La Jolla,\r\nCalif. showing effects of Wave action.]\r\n\r\n_Wave-Action._—The powerful effects of the beating of waves upon abrupt\r\nshores of seas or lakes are in evidence all over the world, and these\r\neffects are so characteristic that they can be recognized even where\r\nno sea or lake exists at present. Gravel and sand are carried in the\r\nsurf and serve as grinding materials, wearing even the hardest rocks\r\ninto grooves, rills, channels and caves, defining sharply the varying\r\ndegrees of hardness or tough resistance in different parts of rocky\r\ncliffs; frequently undermining them and causing extensive rock falls.\r\nThe latter then serve for a time to break the violence of the waves’\r\nonset, and may even cause permanent shore deposits to be formed under\r\ntheir lee.\r\n\r\nSuch deposits are very generally formed on gently sloping beaches,\r\nand as the water gradually recedes, sometimes by elevation of the\r\nground, beach lines or beach-terraces are left, which indicate the\r\nsuccessive levels of the lake or sea. Such old beach lines or terraces\r\nand level-surfaced “buttes” in the Great Basin country, and “bench\r\nlands” elsewhere, show in their structure the characteristic lines of\r\nwave-deposition.\r\n\r\n_Effects of Winds._—The action of winds in transporting soil particles\r\n(dust and sand) is familiar; and the accumulations that may be formed\r\nunder the influence of regular, continuous winds are sufficiently\r\nobvious on lee shores having sandy beaches, inland of which the\r\nformation of sand dunes at times assumes a threatening magnitude. Where\r\nwinds are irregular, frequently reversing their direction, of course\r\nthe local effects will be less obvious, and the transportation of\r\nmaterial actually occurring will often not be noticed. Yet there can be\r\nno doubt of the importance of wind action in soil formation, and there\r\nare cases in which no other agency can explain the facts observed over\r\nwidely extended areas. This is especially true with regard to the soil\r\nmasses of the high plains or plateaus of the dry continental interiors,\r\nwhere not only the regularity of the prevailing winds, but also the\r\nstructure (or absence of structure) and pulverulent character of the\r\nsoil itself, renders this the only rational mode of accounting for its\r\npresence where we find it.\r\n\r\n    The effects that may be exerted by regular winds are well\r\n    illustrated in the plains and deserts of Africa as well as\r\n    those of central Asia. Here we find a distinct subdivision\r\n    of the desert (rainless) areas into the _stony_, from\r\n    which the wind has swept all but the bedrock and gravel\r\n    and where scarcely any natural growth, and certainly no\r\n    cultivation is possible in the almost total absence of\r\n    soil. The next subdivision is the _sandy_ desert,\r\n    to leeward of the stony area, where the winds are less\r\n    violent and regular, and where, therefore, the sand has\r\n    been dropped and is waited back and forth by “sand\r\n    storms,” the surface being covered with moving sand dunes.\r\n    Still farther to leeward we find the region in which the\r\n    finer portions of the desert surface has been deposited;\r\n    here we have “_dust_ storms” so long as the land is\r\n    not irrigated: but the application of water renders the\r\n    soil abundantly fruitful. Such is the case of the Oases\r\n    and fertile border-lands of the Sahara and Libyan deserts.\r\n\r\nIn the cultivated portions of the Mojave and Colorado deserts in\r\nCalifornia, plowing of the land during a dry time is not uncommonly\r\nfollowed by a bodily removal of the loosened soil to neighboring\r\nfields, sometimes leaving a gravel surface behind. Such “blown-out\r\nlands” exist naturally at numerous points in the Colorado desert.\r\n\r\nSven Hedin (Central Asia and Tibet, Vol. II.) shows that from the\r\neffects of the violent storms that prevail in the Gobi or Takla Makan\r\ndesert, Lop-nor lake, the sink of the Tarim river, has in the course\r\nof time shifted its bed as much as fifty miles in consequence of the\r\nexcavation of the southern part of the desert by the wind; while the\r\nsand so blown out, together with the deposits from the rivers, now\r\ntends to fill up the present (southern) lake, which is gradually\r\nreturning northward toward its original site, now a desert, but around\r\nwhich formerly a dense population existed.\r\n\r\nThe great plains of North America, the pampas of South America, the\r\nplateaus of Mongolia and especially the fertile loess region of\r\nnorthwestern China, are also cases in point. The dense dust storms of\r\nthese regions are familiar and unpleasant phenomena, which are often\r\nobserved even by vessels at sea off the east coast of South America,\r\nwhere the dust-laden “pamperos” at times compel them to proceed with\r\nthe same precautions as in a fog; and the same is true of the northeast\r\nwinds blowing off the Sahara desert on the west coast of Africa.\r\n\r\nThe effects of windstorms carrying sand in the _erosion of rocks_ are\r\nvery obvious and striking in many parts of the world; nowhere probably\r\nas much so as on the great plains of western North America, where the\r\ngeological composition of the “bad lands” is frequently impressed\r\nupon the rock surfaces very prominently. The strikingly grotesque\r\nforms are frequently brought out in this way, especially in the case\r\nof “mushroom” rocks, where a hard stratum has remained as a covering\r\nwhile softer layers underneath have been worn away. The illustration\r\nannexed shows such a case on the plains of Wyoming as figured in the\r\nReport of the U. S. Geological Survey, on the Central Great Plains,\r\nby N. H. Darton. Striking examples of the same effects are seen on\r\nthe shores of Lake Michigan in the Grand Traverse region, where the\r\nrocky cliffs are visibly worn away and carved under the influence of\r\nthe regular “sand-blasts” of northwest winds. On a smaller scale the\r\neffects of these sand-blasts may be noted in the cobble-deserts, where\r\nwe frequently find the cobbles worn away on the windward side in a very\r\ncharacteristic manner; the lee side remaining rounded and smooth, while\r\nthe structure of the rock is strongly outlined on the windward side.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.—“Mushroom rocks,” produced by Wind action,\r\nWyoming. (Darton.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASSIFICATION OF SOILS.\r\n\r\n_The physical Constituents_ of soils are thus, in the most general\r\nterms, first, _rock powder_ (“sand”) more or less changed by\r\nweathering; second, _clay_, as one of the chief results of the\r\nweathering process of silicate minerals; and thirdly, _humus_, the\r\ndark-colored remnant of vegetable decay. According to the obvious\r\npredominance of one or the other of these primary ingredients, soils\r\nare popularly, in the most general sense, classed as “heavy” and\r\n“light”; the former term corresponding as a rule to those in which\r\nclay forms a prominent ingredient, while sandy and humous or “mold”\r\nsoils usually fall under the latter designation, because of their easy\r\ntillage. For practical purposes these subdivisions are both convenient\r\nand important, and they form the ordinary basis of land classification.\r\nBeyond these, the degree of fineness of the rock debris, and their\r\nphysical and chemical constitution, determine distinctions such as\r\ngravelly, sandy, silty, loamy, calcareous, siliceous, magnesian,\r\nferruginous, and others of less general application, though locally\r\noften of considerable importance.\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of discussion and definition, however, another basis\r\nof classification is needed, which essentially concerns both the origin\r\nand the adaptations of lands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.—Diagram illustrating the genetic relation of\r\ndifferent soil classes to each other.]\r\n\r\n1. _Sedentary Soils._—When soils have been formed without removal\r\nfrom the site of the original rock, by simple weathering, they are\r\ndesignated as _sedentary_, or _residual_ soils, or “soils in place.”\r\nIn the case of these, the original rock underlies the soil or subsoil\r\nat a greater or less depth, according to the intensity and duration\r\nof the weathering process, and is usually more or less softened and\r\ndecomposed at the surface where it meets the soil layer. The latter of\r\ncourse bears some of the distinctive characters of the parent rock, and\r\nits composition and adaptations may, in a measure, be directly inferred\r\nfrom that origin. Such soils usually contain, especially in their lower\r\nportions, some angular fragments of the parent rock. In some cases\r\nsedentary soils may have been partially derived from rocks that have\r\nbeen removed from above the present country rock by erosion, and in\r\nthat case fragments of such vanished rock may also be present.\r\n\r\nSedentary soils are most commonly found on rock plateaus and on slopes\r\nor plains underlaid by rock strata of but slight inclination, where the\r\nvelocity of the “runoff” rainfall is not sufficient to dislodge the\r\nrock debris. Extended areas of such soils exist in the granitic areas\r\nof the southern Alleghenies, in the “black prairies” of the Cotton\r\nStates, and on the “basaltic” plateaus of the Pacific Northwest.\r\n\r\n2. _Colluvial Soils._—When the soil mass formed by weathering has been\r\nremoved from the original site to such a degree as to cause it to\r\nintermingle with the materials of other rocks or layers, as is usually\r\nthe case on hillsides, and in undulating uplands generally, as the\r\nresult of rolling or sliding down, washing of rains, sweeping of wind,\r\netc., the mixed soil, which will usually be found to contain angular\r\nfragments of various rocks, and is destitute of any definite structure,\r\nis designated as a _colluvial_[6] one. Colluvial soil masses are\r\nfrequently subject to disturbance from landslides, which are usually\r\nthe result of water penetrating underneath, between the soil mass and\r\nthe underlying rock, or sometimes simply of complete saturation of the\r\nformer with water. Aside from such catastrophic action, they commonly\r\nhave a slow downward movement in mass (creep), which ordinarily becomes\r\nperceptible only in the course of years; most quickly where there are\r\nheavy frosts in winter, which act both by direct expansion, and by the\r\nstate of extreme looseness in which the soil mass is left on thawing.\r\nColluvial soils form a large portion of rolling and hilly uplands, and\r\nare of very varying degrees of productiveness.\r\n\r\n[6] The term “overplaced,” used for such soils in late memoirs of\r\nthe U. S. Geological Survey, is at least superfluous, in view of the\r\nperfectly understood term already in general use, and does not seem to\r\ncommend itself for adoption by any special or superior fitness; nor\r\ndoes the suggestion of Shaler (The Origin and Nature of Soils, 12th\r\nRep. U. S. Geol. Survey) to include the colluvial soils within the\r\nalluvial class, commend itself either from a theoretical or practical\r\npoint of view, since but few useful generalizations can apply to both\r\nclasses.\r\n\r\n3. _Alluvial Soils._—When soils are the result of deposition by\r\nstreams, the material having been gathered along the course of the\r\nstream from various sources and carried to a distance before being\r\ndeposited, the soil is designated as _alluvial_. These are the soils\r\nof the valleys, flood-plains, and sea- and lake-borders, past and\r\npresent. Being of mixed origin, their general character may vary\r\nfrom one extreme to the other, both as regards physical and chemical\r\ncomposition. Since, moreover, they represent the finer portions of\r\nthe soils of the regions drained by the water-courses, alluvial\r\nsoils are as a rule of a fine texture; and as representing the most\r\nadvanced decomposition products of the parent rocks, they are usually\r\npreëminently fertile. This is proverbially true of the flood-plains of\r\nrivers, and still more of their deltas—the bodies of lands formed near\r\ntheir outlets into seas or lakes.\r\n\r\n_Character of these soil-classes._—_Sedentary_ soils are as a matter of\r\ncourse, other things being equal, dependent entirely on the parent rock\r\nfor their specific character; and taking into consideration the various\r\nrocks (usually one or few) from which they may have been derived,\r\nnearly the same is true of _colluvial_ soils, except that a portion of\r\nthe clay and finest pulverulent matters may in their case be carried\r\ndown on the lower slopes and into the valleys and streams, by the\r\nhillside rills.\r\n\r\n    According to the calculation of Merrill (_Rocks,\r\n    Rock-weathering, and Soils_, p. 188) granite when\r\n    transformed into soil _without loss_ would increase\r\n    in weight by 88%; more than doubling its bulk. More\r\n    usually, the leaching process _diminishes_ their\r\n    volume as compared with the parent rock.\r\n\r\n_Alluvial_ soils are also of course to a certain extent dependent upon\r\nthe character of the rocks and surface deposits occurring within the\r\ndrainage area of the depositing stream. As a rule their composition\r\nis much more generalized; but their character as to the relative\r\nproportions of sand and clay is essentially dependent upon the velocity\r\nof the water current. Thus in the upper portions of valleys, where the\r\nslope is relatively steep and the velocity therefore high, a large\r\nproportion of cobbles and gravel is often present in the deposits,\r\nsometimes to the extent of rendering cultivation impracticable, or at\r\nleast unprofitable. As the slope and velocity decrease, first coarse\r\nand then fine sand will be the prominent component of the deposited\r\nsoil; while still lower down, in the region of slack water, the\r\nfinest sand or silt, together with clay, will predominate. According\r\nto Hopkins,[7] flowing water will, at a velocity of three inches per\r\nsecond, _carry_ in suspension only fine clay (and silt); at eight\r\ninches it will carry sand as large as linseed. At one and one-third\r\ninches, it will _move_ pebbles one inch in diameter; and at a velocity\r\nof two inches per second, pebbles of egg size are moved along the\r\nstream bed. Since the velocity of streams subject to freshets will\r\nvary greatly from time to time, deposits of very different grain\r\nwill in such cases be found alternating with one another in the soil\r\nstratum of the flood plain. In fact, this alternation and the more or\r\nless stratified structure resulting therefrom, is the distinguishing\r\nmark of alluvial soils as such. It is true that this peculiarity is\r\nalso sometimes found in the case of lands now lying far above the\r\nflood-plains of present rivers; but this is due to the elevation of\r\nthe land or the depression of the river channels at a former period,\r\nprior to which such lands (commonly known as river terraces, benches\r\nor second bottoms) were formed. The same is true of lake terraces\r\n(“mesas”), which cover enormous areas in some parts of the world,\r\nmore particularly in western North America. It must nevertheless be\r\nremembered that such alluvial terrace or bench soils differ in some\r\nrespects from the modern alluvials, on account of their long exposure\r\nto atmospheric action alone; one result of which is that they are\r\nusually much poorer in humus, and therefore of lighter tints, than\r\nthe more modern soils of alluvial origin. Other differences will be\r\nadverted to hereafter.\r\n\r\n[7] Geikie, “Text-book of Geology,” 3d ed.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of course the above distinctions, especially between\r\ncolluvial and alluvial soils, cannot be rigorously maintained in all\r\ncases. There are transitions from one class to the other, so that it\r\nis sometimes optional with the observer to which of the two classes a\r\nparticular soil may be considered as belonging. On the lower slopes of\r\nthe hills bordering alluvial valleys the colluvial slope-soil may often\r\nbe found alternating with the alluvial deposits, or bodily washed away\r\nto be redeposited as alluvium at a greater or less distance.\r\n\r\nOne characteristic of the flood-plain lands of all the larger rivers,\r\nand more or less of all streams subject to periodic overflows, is\r\nthat the land immediately adjoining the banks is both higher and more\r\nsandy than are the lands farther back from the stream. The cause of\r\nthis phenomenon is that as lateral overflow diminishes the velocity of\r\nthat flow, its coarser portions are deposited near the river banks,\r\nwhile the finer particles are carried farther away, until finally only\r\nthe finest—clay-substance—reach the lagoons or lakes filled with the\r\noverflow or backwater, and are there in the course of time deposited\r\nas heavy clay “swamp” soils. The same occurs where rivers empty into\r\nlakes or the sea; and these slack-water or delta lands are, as a rule,\r\nthe most productive on the river’s course. The continued productiveness\r\nof alluvial soils is moreover in many cases assured by the deposition,\r\nduring overflows, of fresh soil-material brought down from the head\r\nwaters of the streams. The Nile, and the Colorado river of the West,\r\nillustrate this point.\r\n\r\n_Lowering of the land-surface by soil formation._—It is evident that\r\nthe soil-forming agencies must in the course of time materially affect\r\nboth the surface conformation and the absolute level of the land. The\r\nsharp pinnacles and crests of rock are abraded into the rounded forms\r\nnow characterizing our uplands and lower ranges of hills and mountains;\r\nand it is estimated that, _e. g._, the general level of the drainage\r\nbasin of the Mississippi river is lowered about one foot in 7,000\r\nyears, the material being carried into the lowlands and the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE CHEMICAL PROCESSES OF SOIL FORMATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chemical Disintegration, or Decomposition._\r\n\r\nIt may be said that in general, the physical agencies of disintegration\r\nare most intensely active in the dry or arid regions of the globe,\r\nwhile chemical processes of decomposition are most active in humid\r\nclimates.\r\n\r\nThe chemical decomposition of rocks is primarily due to the action\r\nof the atmosphere, the average composition of which may be stated as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    ================+==============================+==================\r\n                    |      VOLUME PER CENT.        | WEIGHT PER CENT.\r\n    ----------------+------------------------------+------------------\r\n    Nitrogen        |            78.00             |   75.55\r\n    Oxygen          |            21.00             |   23.22\r\n    Carbonic dioxid |              .03-.04         |     .045-.060\r\n    Ammonia         |      1 to 4 millionths       |\r\n    Water vapor     | Variable; 48 to 83 grams per |\r\n                    |  cubic meter, when saturated |\r\n                    |  between O° and 50°C.        |\r\n    ----------------+------------------------------+------------------\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above, air contains minute amounts of the very\r\nindifferent and therefore practically negligible elements, argon,\r\nkrypton, neon, xenon and helium, the aggregate amount of which in air\r\nis somewhat less than one per cent, of which the greater part is argon.\r\nSo far as known these elements take no part whatever in vegetable or\r\nanimal life, and possess no known chemical action or affinity.\r\n\r\nThe primary active agents in effecting chemical changes in rocks by\r\nwhich soils are formed, are water, carbonic acid,[8] and oxygen; all\r\ntherefore ingredients of the atmosphere. Hence the chemical changes so\r\nbrought about are in the most general sense comprehended within the\r\nterm weathering, as applied to rocks; while the corresponding but more\r\ncomplex action within the soil itself is usually termed fallowing.\r\n\r\n[8] Owing to the universal presence of water (H₂O) in air as well as in\r\nsoils, it is usual and convenient to speak of carbonic dioxid (CO₂) gas\r\nwhen so occurring as carbonic acid (H₂CO₃), of which it produces the\r\neffects (CO₂ + H₂O = H₂CO₃).\r\n\r\n_Effects of Water._—Since but few substances, particularly among\r\nthose forming rocks, are totally insoluble even in pure water,[9] and\r\nsome (such as gypsum) may be considered easily soluble in the same,\r\nthe rain water must exert solvent action wherever it penetrates.\r\nIn nature, however, strictly pure water does not occur, it being\r\ndifficult to obtain it even artificially. Among the “impurities” almost\r\nalways contained in natural water, there are several that materially\r\nincrease its solvent power. Foremost among these, both because almost\r\nuniversally present and on account of its great ultimate efficacy,\r\nis _Carbonic dioxid_, in contact with water forming _carbonic acid_,\r\nthe acidulous ingredient of all effervescent waters, the gas which\r\nis produced in nature by innumerable processes, such as decay,\r\nputrefaction, fermentation, the slow or rapid combustion of vegetable\r\nand animal substances, such as wood, charcoal and all other fuels; by\r\nthe respiration of animals; in the burning of limestone, etc. It is\r\ntherefore of necessity contained in air, on an average to the extent\r\nof about 1-3000 of its bulk in the general atmosphere, but locally\r\nin considerably higher proportions because of proximity to sources\r\nof formation, and of its greater density as compared with air (1½ as\r\nagainst 1). It may thus accumulate in inhabited buildings, in cellars,\r\nwells, mines, caves; and it is contained in considerable proportion in\r\nthe air of the soil. Moreover, being easily soluble in water (to the\r\nextent of an equal volume at the ordinary temperature and barometric\r\npressure) it is contained in all natural water, whether of rains,\r\nrivers, springs or wells, and largely of course in that percolating the\r\nsoil. Such waters may therefore be considered as being acid solvents;\r\nand as such, they exercise a far more energetic and far-reaching effect\r\nthan would pure water.\r\n\r\n[9] See Chapter 18.\r\n\r\n_Carbonated water a universal solvent._—While limestones are the rocks\r\nmost obviously acted upon by carbonated water, few if any resist it\r\naltogether. Even quartz rocks of the ordinary kinds are attacked by\r\nit; only the purest white crystalline quartzite may be considered as\r\nsensibly proof against it. Granite and the rocks related to it are\r\nrather quickly acted upon, because of the presence of the feldspar\r\nminerals containing potash, soda and lime as bases[10] together with\r\nalumina.\r\n\r\n[10] The increase of solvent power on feldspar when carbonated instead\r\nof distilled water is used, was well exemplified in an experiment\r\nmade by Headden (Bull. 65, Color. Exp’t Sta., p. 29), who allowed\r\npure distilled and carbonated water respectively to act on fresh but\r\nfinely pulverized feldspar, with frequent shaking, for five days. The\r\ndistilled water dissolved .0081 gram, the carbonated water, .0723 gram\r\nof solids, or nearly nine times as much as the distilled water. Both\r\nresidues gave strong reactions for potash with platinic chlorid.\r\n\r\nThe results of this action are highly important; one being the\r\nformation of clay, so essential as a physical ingredient of soils; the\r\nother the setting-free of potash, one of the most essential nutrients\r\nof plants. Hornblende and the related minerals are similarly acted\r\nupon so far as they contain the same substances. In all cases, of\r\ncourse, the silica (silicic acid) set free by the carbonic acid remains\r\npartially or wholly in the resulting soils, as such. Lime also at first\r\nmostly remains behind in the form of the carbonate; but potash and\r\nespecially soda compounds, being mostly readily soluble in water, are\r\nlargely carried away by the latter.\r\n\r\nThe effect of carbonated water upon silicate minerals is greatly\r\nincreased by the presence of ammonia (ammonic carbonate), which always\r\nexists in atmospheric water to a greater or less extent. This effect\r\nmay readily be noted on the windows of stables, or other places where\r\nanimal offal decays, by the dimming of the glass surfaces; also in\r\nglass bottles containing solution of ammonic carbonate.\r\n\r\n_Action of Oxygen._—The effects of atmospheric _oxygen_ on rocks\r\nare of course confined to those containing substances capable of\r\nfarther oxidation. Chief among these are ferrous (iron monoxid) and\r\nferroso-ferric oxid the latter imparting bottle-green, bluish and black\r\ntints to so many minerals and rocks that these colors may usually\r\nbe taken as indicating its presence. By taking up more oxygen the\r\nferrous and ferroso-ferric oxids are converted into ferric oxid or its\r\nhydrate (rust), the tints mentioned passing thereby into brick-red or\r\nrust color, according as the former or the latter (or sometimes their\r\nintermixtures) is formed. In either case there is an increase in bulk;\r\nand this when taking place in the cracks or crevices of minerals or\r\nrocks, tends, like the freezing of water, to widen the cracks and thus\r\nto increase the surface exposed to attack. Since ferrous compounds,\r\nwhen soluble in water, are injurious to plant growth, this oxidation\r\nis of no little importance, and in soils must be carefully maintained\r\nagainst a possible reversal.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to insist that the action of all these\r\nchemical agents continues in the soils themselves, and that owing to\r\nthe fineness of the material, resulting in an enormously increased\r\nsurface exposed to attack, such action acquires increased intensity.\r\nThis is the more true as in soils bearing vegetation there are always\r\nsuperadded the effects of the humus-acids resulting from the decay\r\nof vegetable matter, as well as of the acid secretions of the living\r\nplants.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Action of Plants and their Remnants in Soil Formation._\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Mechanical action._—The direct action of plants in forcing\r\ntheir roots into the crevices of rocks and minerals and thus both\r\nwidening them by wedging, and by exposing new surfaces to weathering,\r\nhas already been alluded to. That the mechanical force exerted by root\r\ngrowth is very great, may readily be judged from their effects in\r\nforcing apart, even to rupture, the walls of rock crevices; but actual\r\nmeasurement has shown the force with which the root, _e. g._, of the\r\ngarden pea penetrates, to be equal to from seven to ten atmospheres,\r\nsay from 200 to over 300 pounds per square inch. Such a force, exerted\r\nunder the protection of the corky layer protecting the root tips, often\r\nproduces surprising effects.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Chemical action._—Vegetation takes a most important part, from\r\na chemical point of view, both in the first formation of soils and\r\nin their subsequent relations to vegetable life. The lower forms of\r\nvegetation are usually the first to take possession of rock surfaces;\r\nforemost among these are the lichens. In humid climates we find\r\nthese crust-like plants incrusting more or less all exposed rock\r\nsurfaces, sometimes with a solid mantle that can be peeled off in wet\r\nweather, showing the corroded rock-surface, and the beginnings of soil\r\nclustering amid the root-fibrils beneath. A microscopic examination of\r\nthe substance of these lichens often shows as a prominent ingredient,\r\ncrystals of oxalate of lime, the lime having of course been derived\r\nfrom the rock, while the oxalic acid has been formed by the plant and\r\nused in the corrosion of the rock minerals. When it is remembered that\r\nthis acid is comparable in strength to hydrochloric and nitric acids,\r\nthe energy of the attack of the lichens is explained. Its progress can\r\noften be traced, even beyond the visible root fibers, by a change in\r\nthe color of the rock; _e. g._, from rust-color to brick red.\r\n\r\nWhen by the action of the lichens a certain depth of loosened rock\r\nor half-formed soil has been produced, the next step is usually the\r\nadvent of various mosses, which gradually shade out the crust-like\r\nlichens, while the erect kinds persist for some time. Eventually\r\nthe mosses, after having increased still farther the soil layer on\r\nthe rock surface, are themselves partially or wholly displaced by\r\nthe hardier species of ferns; and with these the higher flowering\r\nplants, such as the stonecrops and saxifrages (the latter deriving\r\ntheir name from their “rock-breaking” effect), the heather, and many\r\nother or shallow-rooted plants, gradually take possession. The roots\r\nof all plants secrete carbonic acid; and many of them, much stronger\r\nvegetable acids, such as oxalic and citric. In the crevices of rocks\r\nwe commonly find the roots forming a dense network over the surfaces,\r\nthe marks of which show plainly the solvent effect produced on the rock\r\nby the root secretions. This is most readily observable on a polished\r\nmarble surface, or on feldspathic rocks. Of course the progress of\r\nsoil-formation is very much more rapid when, as in the case of powdered\r\nlava (volcanic ash) and rock debris resulting from the effects of frost\r\netc., the surface is very much increased. In tropical climates, where\r\nboth vegetative and chemical action is most intense, it takes some of\r\nthe higher plants only a few years after a volcanic eruption to take\r\npossession of portions of the “ash” surfaces; thus helping to form a\r\nsoil on which after a few more years agricultural plants such as the\r\nvine and olive yield paying returns.\r\n\r\nTo this direct action of the higher plants is always added, to a\r\ngreater or less extent, that of innumerable bacteria, as well as molds;\r\nwhose vegetative and secretory action materially assists that of the\r\nroots, and the weathering process in general.\r\n\r\n_Humification._—While the mechanical action of the roots and the\r\nchemical effect of the acids of their root secretions are very\r\nefficient in promoting the transformation of mere rock powder into\r\nsoil material proper, the efficacy does not end with the life of the\r\nplant. In the natural process of decay to which the roots are subject\r\nafter death, and which also affects the leaves, twigs and trunks\r\nfalling on the surface, the vegetable matter suffers a transformation\r\nwhich must be considered more in detail hereafter, and results in\r\nthe formation of the complex mixture of dark-tinted substances known\r\nas vegetable mold or _humus_; the remnant of vegetation that imparts\r\nto surface soils their distinctive dark tint. Its functions in soils\r\nare both numerous, and important to vegetable growth; as regards soil\r\nformation, it assists disintegration of the rock minerals both by the\r\nformation of certain fixed, soluble acids capable of acting on them\r\nwith considerable energy, and by the slow but continuous evolution of\r\ncarbonic acid under the influence of atmospheric oxygen, which has been\r\nalluded to above.\r\n\r\n_Causes influencing chemical action and decomposition._—The chemical\r\nprocesses causing rock decomposition are of course continued in the\r\nsoil, and there also are materially influenced by climatic and seasonal\r\nconditions, which bring about great differences in the kind and\r\nintensity of chemical action.\r\n\r\nWithin the ordinary limits of solar temperatures it may be said that,\r\nother things being equal, the higher the temperature the more intense\r\nwill be chemical action in soil formation. Since, however, water is\r\na potent factor in the majority of these processes, the presence or\r\nabsence of moisture at the same time with heat will cause material\r\ndifferences in the kind and intensity of chemical action. In view of\r\nthe importance of carbonic acid as a chemical agent, the presence or\r\nabsence of vegetable matter or humus, from which by oxidation or decay\r\ncarbonic and humus-acids are formed, will likewise be of material\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\nThe presumption that climatic and seasonal conditions must greatly\r\ninfluence both the kind and rapidity of the soil-forming processes, is\r\nfully borne out by observation and practice. Especially is the amount\r\nand distribution of rainfall of great importance in this respect, and\r\nshould therefore be first considered.\r\n\r\n\r\nINFLUENCE OF RAINFALL ON SOIL FORMATION; LEACHING OF THE LAND.\r\n\r\nIn the general consideration of the soil-forming processes, it has been\r\nstated that soils formed by the disintegration of rocks “in place,” _i.\r\ne._, without removal from the original locality, are also designated as\r\n“residual”; meaning thereby that only a portion of the original rock\r\nremains to form the soil mass, while another portion has been removed.\r\nTo a slight extent this removal occurs by the partial washing-away of\r\nthe finest clay and silt particles; but the most important action from\r\nthe agricultural point of view is the removal by leaching with the\r\ncarbonated water of the atmosphere and soil, of certain easily-soluble\r\ncompounds formed in the process of chemical decomposition of rocks and\r\nresultant soils. The nature of these compounds is exemplified in the\r\nsubjoined table giving the composition of some waters flowing from\r\ndrains in unmanured fields, laid at depths of from two to three feet;\r\nand for comparison with these, the composition of the water of some of\r\nthe world’s large rivers, showing what these largest drains carry into\r\nthe ocean.\r\n\r\nThe analyses have in all cases, where necessary, been recalculated to\r\nparts per million, and to oxids, from the published data.\r\n\r\nThe letter “c” indicates that the preceding figure has in the absence\r\nof a direct determination been stoichiometrically calculated from the\r\ndata given, in order to complete the comparison.\r\n\r\n               COMPOSITION OF DRAINAGE WATERS FROM UNMANURED GROUND.\r\n                              (PARTS PER MILLION.)\r\n\r\n    ======================+=============+=============+==============+\r\n                          | ROTHAMSTED. |  PROSKAU.   |   MOCKERN.   |\r\n                          | (VOELKER.)  | (KROCKER.)  | (Ö.

Magnesia is\r\nnext in amount among the bases; next in amount is soda, largely in\r\nthe form of sodium chlorid or common salt. Potash is present only in\r\nsmall but rather uniform amounts. Of the acids the carbonic is the most\r\nabundant, sulfuric next; chlorin and silicic acid come next, in about\r\nequal amounts. Nitric acid passes off in small, but still relatively\r\nconsiderable amounts.\r\n\r\nComparison of the drain waters with the river waters, while showing a\r\ngeneral qualitative agreement, also shows a marked diminution of total\r\nsolids (from 285.7 to 188.7; hence “soft river water”), and especially\r\nof lime (from 107.6 to 43.2), together with the carbonic acid with\r\nwhich it is mostly combined; indicating a deposition of lime carbonate\r\nin the river deposits or alluvial lands. There is, on the other hand,\r\nlittle if any general difference in the magnesia content of the two\r\nclasses of waters; nearly the same is true of soda, so that these two\r\nbases really show a considerable relative increase when the diminished\r\ntotal is considered. Potash remains about the same all through, viz.\r\ntwo parts or a little more; phosphoric acid shows a fraction of one\r\nmillionth; nitric acid varies greatly but is usually higher in the\r\ndrain waters, sometimes showing a heavy depletion of the land by the\r\nleaching-out of this important plant food.\r\n\r\nIt has been computed by John Murray, as quoted by Russell,[11] that the\r\nvolume of water flowing into the sea in one year, including all the\r\nland areas of the earth, is about 6524 cubic miles. From the average\r\ncomposition of river waters as given above, it would follow that nearly\r\nfive billions (4,975,117,588) of tons of mineral matter are annually\r\ncarried away _in solution_ from the land into the sea. The amount of\r\n_sediment_ carried at the same time is many times greater; in the case\r\nof the Mississippi river, it is more than five times the amount of the\r\nmatter carried in solution.\r\n\r\n[11] Rivers of North America, p. 80.\r\n\r\nComparison of the river waters among themselves shows less of any\r\nconsistent relation to climatic conditions than might have been\r\nanticipated. The waters of the arctic streams Yukon and Dwina show\r\nwider differences than any two other waters in the list, unless it\r\nbe the St. Lawrence, another northern stream. The Missouri and Rio\r\nGrande show by their high content of soda, chlorin and sulfuric acid\r\ntheir origin in arid climates, where alkali lands prevail. The water\r\nof the Nile is here represented by two analyses,[12] one showing the\r\nseason when the water is “red” and of high fertilizing quality because\r\nof the sediment it brings down from the mountains of Abyssinia; the\r\nother the “green” and relatively clear water which comes from the\r\ngreat lakes and through the “sudd ” or grassy swamp region near the\r\njunction of the Gazelle river with the Nile. Of the analyses given of\r\nthe Mississippi river water, the first represents the average of a full\r\nyear’s observations made weekly under the auspices of the New Orleans\r\nCommission on Sewerage and Drainage, by J. L. Porter. The fourth is\r\nan analysis made of water taken at the same point in May, 1905; the\r\nanalysis having been made in full by Mr. Stone, of the Reclamation\r\nService of the U. S. Geol. Survey, the direct determination of potash\r\nand soda being in this case included. As will be seen, and might be\r\nexpected, the average of the Mississippi water corresponds quite nearly\r\nto that of nineteen of the world’s great rivers as given by Murray. The\r\nvery great variation in the content of sulfates is evidently due to the\r\noccasional heavy influx of the gypseous waters of the Washita and Red\r\nrivers when in flood; while the minimum content (in January) agrees\r\nalmost precisely with the general average. Murray’s table would hardly\r\nbe changed if these analyses of Mississippi water were incorporated\r\ntherein, owing doubtless to the large and varied drainage area of the\r\ngreat river.\r\n\r\n[12] The correctness of Letheby’s analyses has been disputed, partly\r\nbecause of their disagreement with former analyses in the very high\r\namount of lime, partly because of the high potash-content in the\r\nLow-Nile water. The lime content is, however, confirmed by the partial\r\nanalyses made by Mathey in 1887, which gives an average of 44.1 for the\r\nyear, while the older analyses, made in Europe, of _transported_ water\r\ngave only half as much. Letheby working on the spot was doubtless more\r\nnearly right in this respect. His figure for potash in the “Low-Nile”\r\nwater agrees with former determinations, but that in the “High-Nile” is\r\napproached only by that in the Dwina water. It may be suspected that\r\nthe soda is too low and potash too high in this analysis.\r\n\r\n_Sea Water._—The nature of the substances permanently leached out is\r\nalso seen by considering the composition of sea water, since the ocean\r\nis the final reservoir for all the leachings of the land. It might be\r\nobjected that the ocean may have received its salts from other sources;\r\nbut this objection is overborne by the fact that substantially the\r\nsame salts are found in landlocked lakes, in which, as they have no\r\noutflow, the leachings of the adjacent regions are perforce, as a rule,\r\nthe only possible source of the salts. It is true that the nature of\r\nthe salts differs somewhat in different lakes, as might be expected;\r\nbut a general statement of that nature will, after all, be the same as\r\nthat made in regard to sea-water. The following table of the average\r\ncomposition of sea-water, according to Regnault, illustrates these\r\nfacts.\r\n\r\n            MEAN COMPOSITION OF SEA-WATER.\r\n\r\n    Sodium Chlorid (common salt)          2.700\r\n    Potassium chlorid                      .070\r\n    Calcium sulfate (gypsum)               .140\r\n    Magnesium sulfate (Epsom salt)         .230\r\n    Magnesium chlorid (bittern)            .360\r\n    Magnesium bromid                       .002\r\n    Calcium carbonate (limestone)          .003\r\n    Water (and loss in analysis)         96.495\r\n                                        -------\r\n                                        100.000\r\n\r\nThe average saline contents of sea-water would thus be 3.505 per cent\r\nIn twenty-one determinations of the saline contents of the Atlantic\r\nOcean, the percentage ranged from 3.506 to 3.710 per cent Of this\r\nmineral residue, common salt constitutes from about 75 to over 80 per\r\ncent.\r\n\r\n    We see that most prominent among the ingredients mentioned\r\n    here is common salt (sodium chlorid), which forms nearly\r\n    four-fifths of the total solid contents. Next in quantity\r\n    are the compounds of magnesium, viz. Epsom salt and bittern,\r\n    with a very small amount of the bromin compound. Next come\r\n    the compounds of calcium (lime), of which gypsum is the\r\n    more abundant, while the carbonate, so abundant on the land\r\n    surface in the various forms of limestone, is present in\r\n    minute amounts only, yet enough to supply the substance\r\n    needed for the shells of shellfish, corals, etc. Least in\r\n    amount of the metallic elements mentioned is potassium.\r\n    Calculating the total amounts of chlorin, we find that it\r\n    exceeds in weight any one other element present in the salts\r\n    of sea-water, being two-sevenths of the whole solids.\r\n\r\n    Substantially the same result, with variations due to\r\n    local causes, as exemplified in the varying composition of\r\n    river and drain waters, is obtained when we consider the\r\n    saline ingredients of lakes having no outlet, and in which\r\n    therefore, the leachings of the tributary land area have\r\n    accumulated for ages. The Great Salt Lake of Utah, the\r\n    landlocked lakes of the Nevada basin, of California, Oregon,\r\n    and of the deserts of Asia, Africa, and Australia, all tell\r\n    the same tale, which may be summarized in the statement that\r\n    the chlorids of sodium and magnesium, and the sulfates of\r\n    sodium, magnesium and calcium constitute the bulk of the\r\n    leachings of the land; while of other substances potassium\r\n    alone is present in relatively considerable amount.\r\n\r\n    While the above analysis shows the ingredients of sea-water\r\n    so far as they can at present be directly determined\r\n    by chemical analysis, yet the presence of many others\r\n    is demonstrable, directly or indirectly, from various\r\n    sources. One is, the mother-waters from the making of\r\n    sea-salt, in which such substances accumulate so as to\r\n    become ascertainable by chemical means, and even become\r\n    industrially available in the cases of potash and bromin.\r\n    Another is the ash of seaweeds, which is indisputably\r\n    derived from the sea-water, and contains, among other\r\n    substances not directly demonstrable in the original\r\n    water, notable quantities of iodin (of which this ash is a\r\n    commercial source), iron, manganese, and phosphoric acid.\r\n    Again, the copper sheathing of vessels, as it is gradually\r\n    corroded, becomes more or less rich in silver, manifestly\r\n    thrown down from the sea-water, and the silver so obtained\r\n    is associated with minute amounts of gold. Copper, lithium,\r\n    and fluorin likewise have been found in sea water; and it\r\n    is probable that close search would detect very many of the\r\n    other chemical elements as ordinary ingredients in minute\r\n    amounts. This is what must be expected from the fact that\r\n    few mineral substances known to us are entirely insoluble in\r\n    pure water, and still fewer in water charged with carbonic\r\n    acid. The latter is always present in sea-water and holds\r\n    the lime carbonate in solution; on evaporation or boiling,\r\n    this substance is the first to be precipitated; and thin\r\n    sheets of limestone from this source are commonly found at\r\n    the base of rock-salt beds, which, themselves, are evidently\r\n    the result of the evaporation of segregated bodies of\r\n    sea-water in past geological ages.\r\n\r\nSumming up the facts concerning the water of the sea and of landlocked\r\nlakes, with reference to the ingredients of soils needful for the\r\nnutrition of plants, it appears that the rock ingredients leached out\r\nin the largest amounts (lime alone excepted) are those of which the\r\nsmallest quantities only are required by most plants; while of those\r\nspecially needful for plant nutrition, only potash is removed in\r\npractically appreciable amounts by the stream drainage.\r\n\r\n_Result of insufficient Rainfall; Alkali Soils._—When the rainfall\r\nis either in total quantity, or in consequence of its distribution\r\nin time, insufficient to effect this leaching, the substances that\r\notherwise would have passed into the drainage and the sea are wholly\r\nor partially retained in the soil; and when the rainfall deficiency\r\nexceeds a certain point, the salts thus retained may become apparent\r\non the surface in the form of saline efflorescences, or as it is\r\nusually termed in North America, “alkali.”[13] Their continued presence\r\nmodifies in various ways the process of soil formation and the nature\r\nof the soils as compared with those of regions of abundant rainfall\r\n(“humid climates”); one of the most prominent and important results\r\nbeing that, besides the easily soluble salts mentioned above, the\r\n_carbonate of lime_ formed in the process of decomposition is also\r\nretained, and imparts to the soils of regions of deficient rainfall\r\n(“arid climates”) the almost invariable character of _calcareous_\r\nlands. There is thus in the United States a marked and practically very\r\nimportant contrast between the soils of the arid region west of the\r\nRocky Mountains and those of the “humid” region between the immediate\r\nvalley of the Mississippi and the Atlantic coast. These differences and\r\ntheir practical bearings can be best discussed after first considering\r\nmore in detail the chemical decomposition of the several soil-forming\r\nminerals.\r\n\r\n[13] In some cases the soluble salts originate in rocks impregnated\r\nwith salts from marine lagoons or landlocked lakes, or directly from\r\ntheir evaporation residues. But this is the exception rather than the\r\nrule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE MAJOR SOIL-FORMING MINERALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the several stratified rocks, such as sandstones, shales,\r\nclaystones, clays, limestones, etc., are themselves but the outcome of\r\nthe same disintegrating and decomposing influences upon the crystalline\r\nrocks by which soils are now formed, we must study the action of these\r\ninfluences upon the minerals composing the latter rocks in order to\r\ngain a comprehensive understanding of the subject. While the number\r\nof different minerals known to science is very large, such study need\r\nnot go beyond a small number of the chiefly important, rock-forming\r\nspecies which are so generally distributed as to require consideration\r\nin this connection. These minerals are the following: Quartz and its\r\nvarieties; the several feldspars; hornblende and augite; the micas;\r\ntalc and serpentine. Calcite, gypsum and dolomite, though not contained\r\nin the older rocks, must be considered because of their forming large\r\nrock deposits by themselves; and zeolites require mention because,\r\nthough rarely forming a large proportion of rocks, they are of special\r\nimportance as soil ingredients.\r\n\r\n_Quartz_ and the minerals allied to it consist essentially of dioxid of\r\nsilicon, usually without (quartz proper) but partly also with water in\r\ncombination (opal and its varieties). _Silicon_ is next to oxygen the\r\nmost abundant element found on the earth’s surface. It occurs largely\r\nin the various forms of quartz, alone, or as one ingredient of compound\r\nrock-masses; the rest, in combination (as silica) with various metallic\r\noxids, forms the important group of silicate minerals, constituting the\r\nbulk of most rocks.\r\n\r\nQuartz occurs frequently in crystals (rock crystal; six-sided prisms\r\nterminated by six-sided pyramids), clear or variously colored; but more\r\nabundantly as quartz rock or quartzite, readily known by its hardness,\r\nso as to strike fire with steel, and by its glass-like, irregular\r\nfracture. Besides the crystalline quartz rock we find close-grained and\r\nat least partly non-crystalline varieties, such as hornstone and flint.\r\nSandstones most commonly consist of grains of quartz cemented by some\r\nother mineral, or by silica itself; in the latter case the siliceous\r\nsandstone frequently passes insensibly into true quartzite. The loose\r\nsand so well known to common life is prevalently composed of quartz\r\ngrains, whose hardness and resistance to weathering enables them to\r\nsurvive longest the soil-forming agencies.\r\n\r\nQuartz and its allied rocks—jasper, hornstone, siliceous schist,\r\netc., are all, as already stated, acted on with difficulty by the\r\n“weathering” agencies. Crystalline quartz rock may be considered as\r\npractically refractory against all but the mechanical agencies, and\r\nhence remains in the form of sand and gravel, more or less rounded\r\nby attrition, as a prominent component of most soils; sometimes to\r\nthe extent of over 92 per cent, even in soils highly esteemed in\r\ncultivation, especially in the arid region. Such soils are mostly\r\nthe result of the disintegration of sandstones, the cement of which\r\nhas been dissolved out in the course of weathering; or they may be\r\nderived directly from geological deposits of more or less loose and\r\nunconsolidated sand. Among crystalline rocks, granites, gneiss and\r\nmica-schists are those most usually concerned in the formation of\r\nsandy soils; since in common parlance, quartz is understood to be the\r\nsubstance of the sand unless otherwise stated. The exceptions are\r\nespecially important in the regions of deficient rainfall.\r\n\r\nBut while crystalline quartz is practically insoluble in all natural\r\nsolvents, the same is not true of the jaspers and hornstones. These\r\nconsist of a mixture of crystalline and amorphous (non-crystalline)\r\nsilica, which is more readily soluble than the crystalline, and is\r\nattacked by many natural waters, especially by those containing even\r\nvery small amounts of the carbonates of potash or soda. We thus\r\noften find that hornstone and jasper pebbles buried in the soil,\r\nwhile still hard internally, have externally been converted into a\r\nfriable, almost chalky substance, consisting of crystalline quartz\r\nfrom which the cementing amorphous silex has been removed by the\r\nsoil water. In the course of time such pebbles may be completely\r\ndestroyed by this process, so as to be light and chalky throughout, and\r\nreadily crushed in tillage. The change is the more striking when, as\r\nfrequently happens, the hornstone pebble is traversed by small veins of\r\ncrystalline quartz, which remain as a skeleton.\r\n\r\n_Solubility of Silica in Water._—It is easily shown experimentally that\r\nthe compound of silica with water (hydrate) is under certain conditions\r\nreadily soluble not only in pure water, but also in such as contains\r\ncarbonic acid. It thus occurs in nearly all spring and well waters;\r\nsome hot springs deposit large masses of it (sinter); and geological\r\nevidence clearly demonstrates that quartz veins have as rule been\r\nformed from water-solutions of silica.\r\n\r\nThat silica in its soluble form circulates freely in the soil water, is\r\nabundantly evident from the large amounts of it which are secreted on\r\nthe outside of the stems of grasses, horsetail rushes and other plants,\r\nimparting a gritty roughness to their outer surface. In the case of\r\nthe giant bamboo grass of Asia, the silica accumulated on the outside\r\nof the joints forms a hard sheath of considerable thickness, known to\r\ncommerce as tabashir.\r\n\r\nThat among the first products of rock decomposition we often find\r\nsmall amounts of the silicates of the alkalies (potash and soda) has\r\nalready been mentioned. It cannot be doubted that the same continues to\r\nbe formed in soil containing the proper minerals; and there they also\r\ntake part in the formation of the easily decomposable hydrous silicates\r\ndesignated as _zeolites_, which are largely instrumental in retaining\r\nthe “reserve” of mineral plant-food in soils.\r\n\r\n\r\nSILICATE MINERALS.\r\n\r\nSilica occurs in nature combined with the oxids of most metals, forming\r\nsilicates; but most abundantly with the earths (lime, magnesia,\r\nalumina) and alkalies (potash and soda). These compounds are the most\r\nimportant in soil formation; and among them the following are the chief:\r\n\r\nThe _Feldspars_, which may be defined as compounds of silicates of\r\npotash, soda or lime (either or all) with silicate of alumina. They\r\nare prominent ingredients of most crystalline rocks; potash feldspar\r\n(orthoclase) with quartz and mica forms granite and gneiss; feldspars\r\ncontaining soda and lime (either or both) form part of many other\r\ncrystalline rocks, such as basalt, diabase, diorite, gabbro and most\r\nlavas. The feldspars are decomposed by weathering rather readily, and\r\nare important in being the chief source of clays as well as of potash\r\nin soils. When acted upon by carbonated water, the bases potash, soda,\r\nand lime or carbonates, the silica being mostly displaced; while the\r\nsilicate of alumina takes up water and forms _kaolinite_, the essential\r\nbasis of clays, and one of the most important constituents of soils;\r\nimparting to them the necessary firmness and cohesion, together with\r\nother important physical properties, discussed more in detail hereafter.\r\n\r\nWhile thus on the one hand feldspars are the source of clay, on the\r\nother they supply one of the most essential ingredients of plant food,\r\nviz. potash; which is first dissolved by the water in the forms of\r\ncarbonate and silicate, but in most cases soon becomes fixed in the\r\nsoil by forming more complex (zeolitic) combinations. The soda not\r\nbeing retained by the soil as strongly as is potash is washed through\r\ninto the country drainage; while if lime is present, it mostly remains\r\nin the form of the carbonate.\r\n\r\nOrthoclase feldspar contains nearly 17% of potash; Leucite, a related\r\nmineral occurring in some lavas, contains 21.5%. The other feldspars\r\ncontain only a few per cent, sometimes none.\r\n\r\nOther silicate minerals, so far as they contain the same bases, are\r\nacted upon similarly to the feldspars.\r\n\r\n    In the decomposition of the feldspars by carbonated water,\r\n    the compounds of potash and soda so formed are soluble in\r\n    water, those of lime and magnesia are insoluble or nearly\r\n    so. Hence pure clays can be formed only in the decomposition\r\n    of the potash-and soda-feldspars (orthoclase, albite) while\r\n    in the case of lime feldspar (labradorite) and the mixed\r\n    feldspars (plagioclase, anorthite) calcareous clays (marls)\r\n    are the result. Lime feldspar resists decomposition more\r\n    tenaciously than do those containing large proportions of\r\n    the strong bases potash and soda; potash feldspar especially\r\n    is attacked most readily, and is the main source of the\r\n    formation of the valuable deposits of porcelain earth or\r\n    _kaolin_, which is essentially a mixture of kaolinite\r\n    with fine silex and more or less of undecomposed feldspar,\r\n    and is of a chalky texture.\r\n\r\n_Formation of Clays._—When instead of remaining in place, this kaolin\r\nis washed away and triturated in the transportation by water, it is\r\npartially changed from its original chalky condition to that plastic\r\nand adhesive form which is the characteristic ingredient of all clays.\r\nThe remarkable properties of this substance and the part it plays\r\nin the physical constitution of soils, will be discussed in another\r\nchapter. Its lightness and extreme fineness of grain (if grain it can\r\nbe called) cause it to be carried farther on by the streams than any\r\nother portion of the products of rock decomposition save those actually\r\nin solution; it can therefore be deposited only in water that is almost\r\nor quite still (as in swamps) so long as the latter is fresh. So soon\r\nhowever as brackish or salt water is encountered, clay promptly gathers\r\ninto floccules (“flocculates”), and thus enveloping the finest-grained\r\nsilts that may have been carried along with it, it quickly settles\r\ndown, forming the “mud banks” and heavy clay soils that are so\r\ncharacteristic of the lower deltas of rivers, as well as of swamps\r\nformed by the backwater or overflow of the same.\r\n\r\nWhen instead of potash feldspar alone, the lime- or soda-lime feldspars\r\nare also concerned in the decomposition process, the resulting clay\r\nsoils will be more or less calcareous, while the soda, as stated above,\r\nis for the greater part leached out permanently.\r\n\r\n_Hornblende_ (Amphibole) and _Pyroxene_ (Augite). These are two very\r\nwidely diffused minerals, differing but little in composition though\r\nsomewhat differently crystallized, mostly in short columnar forms. The\r\ntypical and most abundant varieties of these minerals appear black to\r\nthe eye, though in thin sections they are bottle-green; they form the\r\nblack ingredient of most rocks.\r\n\r\n    The color is due to ferroso-ferric (magnetic) oxid of iron;\r\n    the mineral as a whole may be considered as a silicate of\r\n    lime, magnesia, alumina and iron, varying greatly in their\r\n    absolute proportions; alumina and iron being sometimes\r\n    almost absent. When iron is lacking the mineral may be\r\n    almost white (tremolite, asbestos), and its weathering is\r\n    then much retarded, since the oxygen of the air cannot take\r\n    part in the process of disintegration.\r\n\r\nThe black variety of hornblende is not only the most abundant as\r\na rock-ingredient, but it also the one most easily decomposed and\r\ntherefore most commonly concerned in soil formation. The black\r\nhornblende owes its easy decomposition under the atmospheric influences\r\nto two properties; one, its easy cleavage, whereby cracks are readily\r\nformed and extended by the agencies already mentioned (pp. 1-3). The\r\nother is its large content of ferrous silicate (silicate of iron\r\nprotoxide), whereby it is liable to attack from atmospheric oxygen;\r\nthe latter forms ferric hydrate (iron rust) out of the protoxide, thus\r\ncausing an increase of bulk which tends to split the masses of the\r\nmineral in several directions, while the silex is set free. At the same\r\ntime the carbonic acid of the air converts the silicate of lime and\r\nmagnesia, which forms the rest of the mineral, into carbonates; and the\r\nalumina present forms kaolinite, as in the case of the feldspars. There\r\nis thus formed from this mineral, when alone, a strongly rust-colored,\r\nmore or less calcareous and magnesian clay, constituting the material\r\nfor rather light-textured “red” soils. In most cases however the\r\nhornblende is associated in the rock itself with the several feldspars,\r\n(mostly lime- and soda-lime feldspars) as well as with more or less\r\nquartz. The rust-colored soils are therefore most commonly the joint\r\nresult of the weathering of these several minerals. This is well\r\nexemplified in the case of the “red” soils formed from the so-called\r\ngranites and slates of the western slope of the Sierra Nevada of\r\nCalifornia.\r\n\r\n_Pyroxene_ or _Augite_ so nearly resembles hornblende in its chemical\r\ncomposition and crystalline form, that what is said of the latter may\r\nbe considered as applying to augite also. Owing however to the absence\r\nof any prominent tendency to cleavage, the smooth crystals of this\r\nmineral are attacked much less readily than is hornblende, so that\r\nwe often find them as “black gravel” in the soils formed from rocks\r\ncontaining it. Such soils are particularly abundant and important in\r\nthe region covered by the great sheet of eruptive rocks (basalts,\r\nso-called) in the Pacific Northwest, and on the plateau of South\r\nCentral India (the Deccan), and result likewise from the decomposition\r\nof the black lavas of volcanoes; thus in the Hawaiian islands, and in\r\nthe Andes of Peru and Chile.\r\n\r\nBoth hornblende and augite being either free from, or deficient in\r\npotash, of coarse the soils formed from them are apt to lack an\r\nadequate supply of this substance for plant use. This is markedly true\r\nof hornblende schist or amphibolite rocks.\r\n\r\n_Mica_, commonly known as isinglass, is so conspicuous wherever it\r\noccurs that it is more readily recognized than any other mineral.\r\nIt occurs in glittering scales in soils and sands, and in rocks it\r\nsometimes forms sheets of sufficient size to supply the small panes for\r\nthe doors of stoves, lamp chimneys, etc., which being flexible are not\r\nliable to break, but only gradually scale into very thin films, into\r\nwhich it can also be split by hand. When white, (muscovite, phlogopite)\r\nits scales are sometimes mistaken for silver by mine prospectors; when\r\nyellow, for gold; but their extreme lightness should soon remove these\r\ndelusions. The composition of mica is not widely different from that of\r\nthe two preceding minerals; like these it sometimes contains much iron,\r\nand is then dark bottle-green (biotite); this variety in weathering\r\nbecomes bright yellow, and soon disintegrates.\r\n\r\nThis mineral is so abundant an ingredient of many rocks and soils, that\r\none naturally looks for it to play some definite or important part in\r\nsoil formation. By its ready cleavage it favors the disintegration of\r\nrocks; but it seems that owing to the extremely slow weathering of its\r\nsmooth, shining cleavage surfaces, it exerts no notable effect upon\r\nthe chemical composition of the soil, although, owing to its peculiar\r\ncharacter of fine scales, it sometimes adds not immaterially to the\r\nfacility of tillage in otherwise somewhat intractable soils. So far as\r\nis known at present, its presence or absence does not constitute, in\r\nitself, any definite cause or indication of the quality of any soil.\r\nIt may nevertheless be said that the rock in which it usually occurs\r\nmost abundantly—mica-schist, a mixture of mica and quartz—is known to\r\nform, as a rule, lands of poor quality. On the other hand, the soils\r\nderived from granites and gneisses, even when rich in mica, are usually\r\nexcellent, on account of their content of feldspars, and frequently of\r\nother associated minerals.\r\n\r\n_Hydromica_ differs from the preceding mainly in containing a larger\r\nproportion of combined water; but it hardly decomposes more readily,\r\nand the rocks in which it mainly occurs (hydromica schists) are\r\nrefractory to weathering, and in any case do not yield soils of any\r\nfertility, the mineral being associated simply with quartz.\r\n\r\n_Chlorite_, essentially a silicate of alumina and iron, somewhat\r\nresembles mica but is deep green or black, in small scales. It forms\r\npart of certain rocks (chlorite schists), which greatly resemble\r\nthe hornblende schists, but are usually inferior to the latter as\r\nsoil-formers, containing but little of any direct value to plant life.\r\n\r\n_Talc and Serpentine_, Hydrous silicates of magnesia, are extensive\r\nrock-materials in some regions, and as such require mention as\r\nsoil-formers also. Serpentine usually forms blackish-green rock-masses,\r\nthat although soft disintegrate very slowly in the absence of definite\r\nstructure, and are attacked with some energy only when charged—as is\r\nfrequently the case—with ferrous oxide. The conversion of this into\r\nferric hydrate, so common in nature, here also serves as the point of\r\nattack on a rock otherwise very stable; causing it to crumble, even\r\nthough slowly.\r\n\r\n_Talc_ (the true “soapstone”) being usually free from iron, would be\r\neven more slow than serpentine to yield to weathering, but that its\r\nextreme softness and ready cleavage greatly facilitate its abrasion.\r\nThus talc schist, which is usually a mixture of talc with more or less\r\nquartz, undergoes mechanical disintegration quite readily.\r\n\r\nBut the soils formed from either serpentine or talcose rocks are\r\nalmost always very poor in plant food, and sometimes totally sterile.\r\nMagnesia, though an indispensable ingredient of plant food, is rarely\r\ndeficient in soils and unlike lime does not influence in any sensible\r\ndegree the process of soil formation. Magnesian rocks as a whole are\r\npractically found to be not specially desirable soil-formers, even in\r\nthe form of magnesian limestones. They do not even, as a rule, contain\r\nas many useful accessory minerals as are commonly found in limestones.\r\nMoreover, an excess of magnesia over lime is injurious to most crops,\r\nas is shown later (chapt. 18).\r\n\r\n_The Zeolites._—Zeolites may be defined as hydro-silicates containing\r\nas bases chiefly lime and alumina, commonly together with more or\r\nless of potash and soda, more rarely magnesia and baryta. The water\r\nis easily expelled by heating, but is present in the basic form, not\r\nmerely as water of crystallization. All zeolites are readily decomposed\r\nby chlorhydric and other stronger acids.\r\n\r\n    The zeolites proper are not original rock ingredients,\r\n    but are formed in the course of rock decomposition by\r\n    atmospheric agencies, heated water, and other processes not\r\n    fully understood. They are therefore usually found in the\r\n    cavities and crevices of rocks that have been subject to the\r\n    influence of atmospheric or thermal waters, most frequently\r\n    in eruptive rocks, particularly in the vesicular cavities\r\n    characterizing what is known as amygdaloids. They are also\r\n    found in the crevices of sandstones and shales percolated\r\n    by water, as well as in nodules of infiltration (geodes),\r\n    in which they are frequently associated with quartz. Those\r\n    found in the cavities of rocks are usually well crystallized\r\n    wherever room is afforded, and are readily recognized by\r\n    their crystalline form; they are mostly colorless, sometimes\r\n    yellow or reddish.\r\n\r\n_Exchange of bases in Zeolites._—Although zeolites rarely form a large\r\nproportion of rock-masses and therefore do not enter directly into the\r\nsoil minerals to any great extent, their interest in connection with\r\nsoil-formation is very great, because of the continuation, within the\r\nsoil, of the same processes that bring about their formation in rocks.\r\nUnder the conditions existing in soils they will naturally rarely\r\nform crystals, but will appear in the pulverulent or gelatinous form,\r\nleaving the zeolitic nature of the material to be inferred from its\r\nchemical behavior. Among these characters the ready decomposability\r\nby acids has already been mentioned; another of special importance in\r\nthe economy of soils is the fact that when a pulverized zeolite is\r\nsubjected to the action of a solution containing either of the stronger\r\nbases usually present (potash, soda or lime), such base or bases\r\nwill be partially or wholly taken up by the zeolitic powder, while\r\ncorresponding amounts of the bases originally present will pass into\r\nsolution.\r\n\r\n    Thus when a hydrosilicate of soda and alumina is digested\r\n    with a solution of potassic chlorid or sulphate, the soda\r\n    may be partially or wholly replaced by potash, while the\r\n    corresponding sodium salt passes into solution. In the case\r\n    of zeolites containing lime or magnesia or both, the action\r\n    of potassic or sodic chlorid will be to partially replace\r\n    the lime, while calcic and magnesic chlorids pass into\r\n    solution, resulting in the partial or complete replacement\r\n    of the lime by one or the other, or by both bases. It is\r\n    important to note that, other things being equal, potash\r\n    is usually absorbed in greater amounts and is held more\r\n    tenaciously than soda. The process may frequently be\r\n    partially or wholly reversed again, by subsequent treatment\r\n    with large amounts of solutions of the displaced base or\r\n    bases. Thus while a solution of potassic chlorid may be made\r\n    to expel almost completely the sodium present in analcite,\r\n    subsequent treatment with sodic chlorid solution will again\r\n    almost completely displace the potash before taken up.\r\n    The same happens when the natural mineral potash leucite,\r\n    (see p. 32) of frequent occurrence in certain lavas, is\r\n    pulverized and treated with a sodic solution; resulting\r\n    finally in the production of a mass corresponding to natural\r\n    analcite, the sodium mineral corresponding to leucite.\r\n\r\nIn other words, in any zeolitic powder the alkaline or alkaline earth\r\nbases present may be partially or wholly displaced by digestion with an\r\nexcess of solution of any of these, varying according to the amount of\r\nsolution employed, and the length of time and temperature of action.\r\n\r\nThis characteristic behavior of zeolites is exactly reproduced in\r\nsoils. Few soils permit any saline solution to pass through them\r\nunchanged; solutions of alkaline chlorids filtered through soils almost\r\ninvariably cause the passing through of calcium and magnesium chlorids,\r\nwhile a part of the alkaline base is retained; and as a matter of fact,\r\nwe find that this absorbing power of soils for alkaline bases is more\r\nor less directly proportional to the amount of matter which may be\r\ndissolved or decomposed with elimination of silica, by means of acids.\r\n\r\n    This absorption of bases from solutions by chemical\r\n    fixation will be farther discussed later on; but it should\r\n    be mentioned here that both naturally and artificially,\r\n    rock-masses are very commonly cemented, wholly or in part,\r\n    by zeolitic material. Hydraulic concretes may be considered\r\n    as sandstones or conglomerates whose grains are cemented by\r\n    a zeolitic cement consisting of silica, lime and alumina,\r\n    with usually some potash or soda, and of course containing\r\n    the basic water; hence unaffected by the farther action of\r\n    the latter substance after the time of setting has expired,\r\n    which varies somewhat according to the nature of the\r\n    material used. That similar cements should occur in natural\r\n    sandstones is to be expected; thus we find not unfrequently\r\n    that certain sandstones are materially softened, and their\r\n    resistance destroyed, by treatment with even moderately\r\n    dilute acid, while silica and the usual zeolite bases pass\r\n    into solution. It is not often, however, that zeolitic\r\n    material alone cements the sandstone; it is most frequently\r\n    associated with siliceous, calcareous and sometimes even\r\n    with ferruginous cementing material.[14]\r\n\r\n[14] A zeolitic mass, at first gelatinous and then becoming\r\ngranular-crystalline is frequently observed oozing from the lower\r\nsurface of newly made concrete reservoir dams: just as we find similar\r\noozes consolidated into natrolite crusts in the crevices of natural\r\nsandstones.\r\n\r\n\r\nCALCITE AND LIMESTONES.\r\n\r\n_Calcite_ or calcareous spar is one of the minerals most commonly known\r\nin the crystallized form, and is readily recognized by its perfect\r\ncleavage in three directions, producing cleavage forms with smooth,\r\nrhomb-shaped faces (rhombohedrons); these are sometimes colorless and\r\nperfectly transparent, and laid on printed paper show the letters\r\ndouble. But it may be whitish-opaque, and of various colors, which\r\nmay also be imparted to the limestones formed from it. It is readily\r\ndistinguished from quartz, which it sometimes resembles, by its\r\ncleavage, its inferior hardness, being easily scratched with a knife;\r\nand by its effervescence with acids, the latter being the crucial test\r\nwhen other marks are unavailable, as when it forms soft granular masses\r\nor “marls.” In all cases it can be recognized by its crystalline form\r\nunder the microscope, even when the substance containing it has been\r\npulverized in a mortar. The great importance of this compound—calcic\r\ncarbonate—from the agricultural point of view renders it desirable that\r\nit, as well as limestones as such, should be recognized, when seen, by\r\nevery farmer.\r\n\r\n    In mass the pure mineral constitutes white marble; colored\r\n    or variegated marbles are more or less impure from the\r\n    presence of other minerals. Some compact limestones also\r\n    are nearly pure; and as supplying only a single ingredient\r\n    of plant food these would not be much better soil-formers\r\n    than quartz or serpentine. But it is quite otherwise with\r\n    _common_ limestones; the mass of which, it is true,\r\n    is formed of calc-spar, but owing to its origin, is in the\r\n    great majority of cases so far commingled with other matters\r\n    of various character, that limestones are popularly reputed\r\n    to form the very best soils. “A limestone country is a rich\r\n    country” is a popular axiom to which there are, on the\r\n    whole, but few exceptions.\r\n\r\n_Origin._—Actual observation of what is happening at the present time,\r\nas well as the examination of the rock as anciently formed, prove\r\nconclusively that with insignificant exceptions, all limestones have\r\nbeen formed from the framework and shells, and to some extent from the\r\nbones, of marine and fresh-water organisms, ranging in size from the\r\nextinct giants of the lizard relationship to those recognizable only by\r\nthe microscope. Owing to the solubility of lime carbonate in carbonated\r\nwater, the organic forms have often (in crystalline limestones) been\r\nalmost completely obliterated in some portions, but in others are so\r\npreserved as to prove undeniably the similarity of origin of the whole,\r\nand that they have been formed in relatively shallow water, as they are\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\n_Impure Limestones as Soil-formers._—From what has been said regarding\r\nthe composition of sea-water, it will readily be inferred that a pure\r\ndeposit of any one kind cannot easily be formed in it; moreover,\r\nthe matter held in mechanical suspension everywhere near the coasts\r\nmust very commonly be included within the calcareous deposits formed\r\noff-shore. Hence few limestones dissolve in acids without leaving a\r\nresidue of sand, clay and various other substances, usually even some\r\norganic matter not fully decomposed; sometimes less than half of the\r\nmass is really lime carbonate. It is obvious that when the solvent\r\naction of carbonated water is exerted upon such impure limestones,\r\na loose residue of earthy matters will remain behind. It is by this\r\nprocess that a considerable proportion of the richest soils in the\r\nworld have been formed, which have given rise to the popular maxim\r\nabove quoted. They are emphatically “residual” soils; sometimes, it is\r\ntrue, somewhat removed, by washing-away, from their point of origin,\r\nbut in many cases forming a compact soil-layer on top of the unchanged\r\nrock, into which there exists every shade of transition. Striking\r\nexamples of such residual soils in place are seen in the black prairies\r\nof the southwestern United States; they are mostly rather “stiff”\r\n(clayey), and hence has arisen a local popular error, to the effect\r\nthat clay or “heavy” soils are always calcareous. On the other hand,\r\nthe blue-grass region of Kentucky, and most of the lands of the arid\r\nregions are prominent examples of “light” calcareous soils.\r\n\r\n    _Caves, Sinkholes, Stalactites._—Perhaps the most\r\n    striking exemplification of the solvent power of carbonated\r\n    water is seen in the formation of limestone caves. As a\r\n    matter of fact, the vast majority of all existing caves\r\n    is found in limestone formations; and such formations,\r\n    as will be more fully discussed hereafter, nearly always\r\n    bear a luxuriant vegetation. The water filtering through\r\n    the vegetable mold, in which carbonic acid is constantly\r\n    being formed, becomes charged with it, and on reaching\r\n    the underlying rock, dissolves to a corresponding extent\r\n    the lime carbonate of which this rock wholly or chiefly\r\n    consists. When penetrating crevices it soon enlarges these,\r\n    to an extent proportioned to the length of time and the\r\n    strength of the solvent; and thus gradually subterranean\r\n    passages or caves are formed, which at first are almost\r\n    always the bed of a stream, the mechanical action of which\r\n    accelerates the process of enlargement, until after some\r\n    time the water is perhaps drained off through some crevice\r\n    to a lower level, where the same process is repeated.\r\n\r\n    Sometimes the ceiling gives way, forming the funnel-shaped\r\n    “sinkholes” or “lime-sinks” so familiar in some of the\r\n    Mississippi Valley States. Sometimes the lime solution\r\n    on reaching the ceiling of the cave, instead of dropping\r\n    down, evaporates there and eventually forms icicle-like\r\n    “_stalactites_” out of the dissolved substance; while\r\n    when dropping on the floor and thus growing upwards, the\r\n    corresponding formation is called “_stalagmite_.” These\r\n    caves, subterranean rivers, sinkholes, natural bridges and\r\n    tunnels, etc., mostly owe their origin to this solvent\r\n    action of carbonated water on limestone formations.[15]\r\n\r\n[15] T. M. Reade (in his treatise on Chemical Denudation in Relation\r\nto Geological Time) calculates that 143.5 tons of lime carbonate are\r\nannually removed by solution from each square mile of land in England\r\nand Wales, and that the average amount thus removed annually from each\r\nsquare mile of the earth’s surface is about fifty tons.\r\n\r\nThe same occurs on a small scale, when calcareous land is underdrained;\r\nthe lime carbonate dissolved from the soil is partially deposited in\r\nthe drain pipes, which it frequently obstructs. Similarly, an impure,\r\nporous deposit of calcareous tufa is frequently formed on the surface,\r\nat the foot or in rills of calcareous hills. When “hard” water, being\r\nusually such as contains lime carbonate dissolved in carbonic acid, is\r\nboiled, or long exposed to the air, carbonic gas escapes and the lime\r\nsalt is deposited partly on the walls of the kettle, partly forming a\r\npellicle on the surface of the water.\r\n\r\n_Dolomite_, or bitter spar, greatly resembles calcite in its aspect\r\nand properties, although containing nearly half its weight (47.6%)\r\nof magnesic, together with calcic carbonate. It is, however, nearly\r\nalways whitish-opaque; its crystalline and cleavage surfaces are\r\nusually somewhat curved; and its effervescence with acids is much\r\nless lively than in the case of calcite. Like the latter it often\r\nforms pure granular rock deposits, frequently used instead of marble\r\nand limestone, and under that designation. The dolomite rocks,\r\nhowever, are much more subject to weathering than the non-magnesian\r\nlimestones, and it is a curious fact that in contradistinction to the\r\nlimestone regions proper, those having strongly magnesian limestones or\r\ndolomites as their country rock are frequently remarkably sterile. In\r\nsome portions of Europe dolomite areas are sandy deserts, whose sand\r\nconsists of weathered dolomite, so pure as to offer no adequate supply\r\nof mineral food to plants. In the United States, magnesian limestones\r\nunderlie the “barrens” of several States and thus seem to justify their\r\nEuropean reputation of being poor soil-formers. The exact cause of\r\nthis difference is not fully understood, for at first sight it is not\r\nclear why the presence of the magnesian carbonate should interfere with\r\nthe well-known beneficial effects of the lime compound. O. Loew and\r\nMay[16] and others have, however, shown that a certain excess of lime\r\nover magnesia in the soil is necessary to prevent the injurious effects\r\nexerted by magnesic compounds on plant nutrition, in the absence of an\r\nadequate supply of lime. This point will be discussed more in detail\r\nfarther on.\r\n\r\n[16] Bull. No. 1, U. S. Dept. Agr. Veg. Path. and Physiol. Investig.\r\n\r\n_Selenite_ or _Gypsum_, sulfate of lime with about 14 per cent of\r\nwater, though not as abundant in nature as the carbonate or limestone,\r\nis a very widely disseminated mineral and often occurs in large\r\nmasses over considerable areas. These are undoubtedly in most cases\r\nthe result of evaporation of sea water (see p. 26), more rarely of\r\nthe transformation of limestone. In mass it frequently resembles the\r\nlatter, but is readily distinguished by its softness; it does not grit\r\nbetween the teeth, is readily cut with a knife and does not effervesce\r\nwith acids. Very commonly it occurs in crystals, which are easily split\r\ninto thin plates. The crystals are very frequently found imbedded in\r\ngray or bluish, tough clays, in rosettes, or flat sheets which mostly\r\nshow characteristic incurrent angles (caused by twinning), and are\r\nhence known as “swallowtail” crystals. Such sheets of selenite are\r\npopularly called “isinglass,” which name however is equally applied to\r\nthe mineral mica (see p. 35).\r\n\r\nGypsum is only exceptionally an abundant ingredient of soils; yet\r\nsuch soils prevail quite extensively on the upper Rio Grande, in New\r\nMexico and adjacent portions of Chihuahua, Coahuila, and on the Staked\r\nPlains of Texas. Here whole ranges of hills are sometimes composed of\r\ngypseous sand, bear a scanty, peculiar vegetation, and are ill adapted\r\nto agricultural use. It may be said in general that few naturally\r\ngypseous soils are very productive. This is largely because of the very\r\nheavy clays which commonly accompany it, as the compound itself is not\r\nonly not hostile to plant life but is in extended use as a valuable\r\nfertilizer (“land plaster”) for special purposes. From causes not fully\r\nunderstood as yet, it particularly promotes the growth of leguminous\r\nplants, notably the clovers; and as stated in chapter 9, it also\r\nspecially favors nitrification in soils. In the arid region it renders\r\nimportant service in the neutralization of “black alkali” or carbonate\r\nof soda in alkali soils. Being soluble in 400 parts of water, it easily\r\npenetrates downward in most soils, and in doing so effects changes in\r\nthe zeolitic portions, setting free potash from silicates and thus\r\nindirectly supplying plants with this essential ingredient in a soluble\r\nform. About 200 pounds per acre is an ordinary dose.\r\n\r\nFor agricultural use the rock gypsum is ground in mills so as to be\r\neasily distributed, and dissolved by the soil water. Frequently,\r\nhowever, it occurs in the soft granular form (gypseous marl) requiring\r\nonly light crushing; thus in the hills bordering the Great Valley of\r\nCalifornia, and in parts of New Mexico and Texas.\r\n\r\n_Iron Minerals._—In connection with calcite and dolomite, the several\r\nminerals constituting the common iron ores require mention. One of\r\nthese is:\r\n\r\n_Iron Spar_ or siderite; carbonate of iron, corresponds in composition\r\nto calcite and dolomite and crystallizes in the same form. It sometimes\r\noccurs in large masses and is an important iron ore, brownish-white\r\nin color, and when compact resists the attack of atmospheric oxygen\r\nremarkably well. Like the carbonates of lime and magnesia, it is\r\nsoluble in carbonated water, and its deposits are undoubtedly formed\r\nfrom such solutions. The latter are copiously formed wherever\r\nfermenting or decaying organic matter is in contact with iron-bearing\r\nmaterials, such as rust-colored sands or clays; and if the solution so\r\nformed can percolate without coming in contact with air, iron spar is\r\nformed. But whenever the solution comes in contact with air, it absorbs\r\noxygen and the ferrous carbonate is converted into ferric hydrate or\r\nrust, mineralogically known as:\r\n\r\n_Limonite_ or brown iron ore. This ore is frequently found deposited\r\non the upper surface of clay layers traversing sandy strata, the clay\r\nhaving arrested the carbonate solution and thus given time to the air\r\nto effect the change. Sometimes such deposits form great masses in\r\nrock-caves, fissure-veins, or crevices; and like siderite, it is an\r\nimportant iron ore, though frequently quite impure, as in the case\r\nof _bog ore_, which is formed in ill-drained subsoils. It is also\r\nsometimes found as the residue from the weathering of rocks rich in\r\nhornblende or pyroxene, and in this, as well as in other cases, is\r\npulverulent, constituting _yellow ochre_. It makes a rust-colored\r\nstreak on biscuit porcelain or unglazed queensware. _It is the coloring\r\nmaterial of all yellow or “red” soils and clays_, as well as of brown\r\nsandstones, which are cemented by it.\r\n\r\nAs is well known, such clays and sandstones become dark red by heating\r\nor “burning,” as in the case of common brick clays; the brown or yellow\r\nferric hydrate losing its water and becoming red ferric oxid. The\r\nlatter sometimes occurs in nature in the impure, pulverulent condition,\r\nconstituting “red ochre”; but more commonly and abundantly it is found\r\nin the form of\r\n\r\n_Hematite_ or red iron ore, which is sometimes formed in nature by\r\nlimonite losing its water, but more commonly in different ways. It\r\nis but rarely found in soils and is of no special interest in that\r\nconnection.\r\n\r\nA fourth form of iron ore, quite common in the soils of some regions, is\r\n\r\n_Magnetite_ or magnetic iron ore, also known as lodestone. This\r\nmineral, the oxygen-compound of iron corresponding to “blacksmith’s\r\nscale,” also occurs in large masses and is an important and usually\r\na very pure iron ore. It occurs very commonly disseminated through\r\ncertain rocks, and in their weathering it remains unattacked and thus\r\npasses unchanged into the soils and sands, constituting the “black\r\nsand” so well known to gold miners and almost universally present in\r\nthe alluvial soils of the Pacific coast. These black grains are of\r\ncourse attracted by the magnet and can thus be easily recognized and\r\nextracted. In soils they are simply inert, like quartz sand.\r\n\r\nBut while the ore is of little interest to the farmer, it is quite\r\notherwise with the compound of this oxid with water, the ferroso-ferric\r\nhydrate; intermediate in composition between the white ferrous and the\r\nbrown ferric hydrates. As mentioned above, the black silicate minerals,\r\nsuch as hornblende and pyroxene, are bottle-green when seen in thin\r\nsections. Nearly the same color, with modifications running toward\r\nblue and bright green, is often seen in natural clays and rocks, and\r\nis almost always caused by the ferroso-ferric hydrate. Such materials\r\nalways become red or reddish when heated by the formation of red ferric\r\noxid; while when exposed to damp air, they assume the rust color of\r\nferric hydrate.\r\n\r\n_Reduction of ferric hydrate in ill-drained soils._—When such oxidized,\r\nrust-colored clays or soils are exposed to the action of fermenting\r\norganic matter, the first effect observed is the change of color\r\nfrom rusty to bluish or greenish, by the reduction of the ferric to\r\nferroso-ferric hydrate. Afterward, if the action is continued, the\r\nsolution of ferrous carbonate (see above) may be formed, and the\r\ngreenish or bluish color may disappear.\r\n\r\nThe importance of this reaction to farming practice lies in the fact\r\nthat the blue or green tint, wherever it occurs, indicates a lack\r\nof aeration, usually by the stagnation of water, in consequence of\r\nimperfect drainage. Such a condition, always injurious to plants,\r\nbecomes doubly so when it is associated with the formation of a\r\nmetallic solution, such as ferrous carbonate, and promptly results in\r\nthe languishing or death of plants in consequence of the poisoning of\r\ntheir roots. In the presence of sulfates such as gypsum, the formation\r\nof iron pyrite (ferric bisulfid) and sulfuretted hydrogen, is likely to\r\ntake place. Moreover, under the same conditions the phosphoric acid of\r\nthe soil may be concentrated into ferrous or ferric phosphate, which\r\npass into deposits of bog ore in the subsoil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE VARIOUS ROCKS AS SOIL-FORMERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rock-weathering in arid and humid Climates._—From what has been\r\nsaid in the preceding chapters of the physical and chemical agencies\r\nconcerned in rock-weathering, it is obvious that climatic differences\r\nmay materially influence the character of the soils formed from one\r\nand the same kind of rock. Since kaolinization is also a process of\r\nhydration, the presence of water must greatly influence its intensity,\r\nand especially the subsequent formation of colloidal clay; so that\r\nrocks forming clay soils in the region of summer rains may in the arid\r\nregions form merely pulverulent soil materials. Many striking examples\r\nof these differences may be observed, _e. g._, in comparing the outcome\r\nof the weathering of granitic rocks in the southern Alleghenies with\r\nthat of the same rocks in the Rocky Mountains and westward, especially\r\nin California and Arizona. The sharpness of the ridges of the Sierra\r\nMadre, and the roughness of the hard granitic surfaces, contrasts\r\nsharply with the rounded ranges formed by the “rotten” granites of the\r\nAtlantic slope, where sound, unaltered rock can sometimes not be found\r\nat a less depth than forty feet; while at the foot of the Sierra Madre\r\nridges, thick beds of sharp, fresh granitic sand, too open and pervious\r\nto serve as soils, cover the upper slopes and the “washes” of the\r\nstreams, causing the latter to sink out of sight. A general discussion\r\nof the kinds of soils formed from the various rocks must, therefore,\r\ntake these differences into due consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL CLASSIFICATION OF ROCKS.\r\n\r\nRocks may be broadly classified into three categories, viz:\r\n\r\n1. _Sedimentary_ rocks, formed by deposition in water and hence more or\r\nless distinctly stratified.\r\n\r\n2. _Metamorphic_ rocks, formed from rocks originally sedimentary, by\r\nsubterranean heat in presence of water. Usually crystalline, that is,\r\ncomposed of more or less distinct (large or minute) crystals of one or\r\nseveral of the minerals mentioned above.\r\n\r\n3. _Eruptive_ rocks, ejected in the molten state from volcanoes or\r\nfissures; crystalline or not, according to slow or rapid cooling.\r\n\r\n_Sedimentary Rocks._—Sedimentary rocks are forming to-day by deposition\r\nfrom either sea or fresh water, precisely as they were in the most\r\nremote geological times; the oldest clearly sedimentary rocks being\r\nsometimes undistinguishable in their nature and composition from the\r\nvery latest immediately preceding our present time. They may for the\r\npurposes of the present work be simply classified as follows:\r\n\r\n1. _Limestones_, formed in comparatively shallow seas, or fresh water\r\nbasins, from the calcareous shells or skeletons of various organisms.\r\n\r\n2. _Sandstones_, and conglomerates (sometimes called pudding-stones)\r\nformed from the debris of pre-existing rocks disintegrated by the\r\nagencies described above, (chap. 1-2), re-cemented by means of\r\nsolutions of one or several substances, such as silex, carbonate of\r\nlime, ferric hydrate and others. Loose sands and gravels are the\r\ninitial stages of such rock formation as well as the results of their\r\ndisintegration.\r\n\r\n3. _Clays_, _Claystones and Clay shales_, consisting of clay substance\r\nwith more or less sand, and soft or hard according to the nature of the\r\nwaters or solutions that may have acted upon them, with or without the\r\naid of heat. These rocks can only be formed in comparatively quiet or\r\n“back” waters, since clay would not ordinarily be deposited in moving\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n_Metamorphic Rocks._—The effects of subterranean heat or metamorphism\r\nupon the sedimentary rocks may be roughly stated as follows:\r\n\r\n_Limestones_ are transformed into marbles of various degrees of purity,\r\naccording to the nature of the original rocks.\r\n\r\n_Sandstones_ when cemented by silex are transformed into quartzite, of\r\ngreater or less purity according to the nature of the “sand” entering\r\ninto its composition. When cemented by materials other than quartz,\r\nthese also will be segregated in the form of various minerals in the\r\nbody of the rock.\r\n\r\nThe _clay rocks_ form the most varied products under the influence of\r\n(aqueo-igneous) metamorphism; granites, gneiss, syenite and hornblendic\r\nschist are among the most common. The great variations in the\r\ncomposition of clayey materials account for the correspondingly great\r\nvariations in the nature of the resultant metamorphic rocks.\r\n\r\n_Igneous or Eruptive Rocks._—These are usually divided into two groups;\r\nthe one characterized by a large proportion of free quartz (silicic\r\nacid), and hence designated as _acidic_, and usually of a light tint;\r\nthe other the _basic_, containing little or no free quartz, and\r\ncommonly of a dark tint caused by the presence of a large amount of\r\niron (contained in pyroxene, more rarely in hornblende).\r\n\r\n    Of the latter class are the dark “basaltic” rocks\r\n    constituting the mass of the enormous eruptive sheet\r\n    of the Pacific Northwest, covering the greater part of\r\n    Washington, Oregon and northeastern California. The lavas\r\n    of the Hawaiian islands are of the same class and even more\r\n    basic; while the eruptives of Nevada, middle and southern\r\n    California, and eastward to the Rocky Mountains, are mostly\r\n    of the light-colored, acidic type. The same is largely true\r\n    of the rocks of the Andes of Central and South America, the\r\n    gray “Andesites,” also represented in the Caucasus.\r\n\r\nAs one and the same eruptive material may, according to the greater or\r\nless rapidity of cooling, appear as a glassy mass (obsidian, pumice,\r\nvolcanic ash, tuff, etc.,) or as a crystalline rock resembling coarse\r\ngranite in structure, it is not easy to identify them in all their\r\nvarious forms. This can frequently be done only by ascertaining their\r\ncomponent minerals by the microscope, or by chemical analysis. The\r\nsame is sometimes true of metamorphic rocks; and as in the latter, the\r\nseveral feldspars and quartz, with pyroxene instead of hornblende,\r\nconstitute the predominant soil-forming minerals. More rarely, garnet,\r\nchrysolite, leucite and other silicates require consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Generalities regarding the Soils derived from various Rocks._\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to insist that as in the case of the rocks\r\ncomposed of single minerals, already referred to above, the predominant\r\nmineral or minerals of compound rocks determine the facility of\r\nweathering, as well as the quality of the soil resulting therefrom.\r\nSince rocks are named essentially in accordance with the _kinds_ of\r\nminerals that constitute their regular mass, the _proportion_ in which\r\nthe several constituents stand to each other may vary greatly. Thus a\r\n_granite_ may consist, over considerable areas, mainly of a mixture of\r\npotash feldspar and quartz; in others, mainly of quartz and mica with\r\nlittle feldspar. Very frequently, hornblende replaces mica partially\r\nor wholly. The latter will weather much more slowly than feldspar\r\nor hornblende, and will produce an inferior soil when decomposed.\r\nAllowing for such variations, a fairly approximate general estimate\r\nof the quality and peculiarities of soils from crystalline rocks may\r\nnevertheless be made. To some extent such estimates must make allowance\r\nnot only for the chief ingredients, but also for those which are\r\ncalled “accessory” or characteristic, and which while not present in\r\nlarge amount, may nevertheless exert a considerable influence upon the\r\nquality of the soil.\r\n\r\n_Soils from granitic and crystalline rocks._—In the case of the\r\n(potash-feldspar) granite soils it is generally admissible to expect\r\nthat they will be fairly supplied with phosphoric acid, because in\r\nthe great majority of cases, minute crystals of apatite (phosphate of\r\nlime) are more or less abundantly scattered through it. From the potash\r\nfeldspar present, granite soils may always be relied on for a good\r\nsupply of potash for plant use; on the other hand, unless hornblende be\r\npresent, they are pretty certain to be deficient in lime, since neither\r\nlime, feldspar nor calcite are probable accessory ingredients of this\r\nrock.\r\n\r\nGranite is exceedingly apt to weather by mechanical disintegration\r\nfar in advance of its chemical decomposition. It is therefore common\r\nto find in sedentary soils overlying granite, a gradual increase of\r\ngrains of its component crystalline minerals as we descend in the\r\nsubsoil; until finally the latter grades off into rock almost unchanged\r\nsave in lacking coherence. This is seen strikingly in the southern\r\nAppalachians, as well as in the Sierra Nevada and Sierra Madre of\r\nCalifornia; at Cintra in Portugal, at Heidelberg in Germany, and\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nBut of the rocks that resemble granite and are popularly so called, a\r\ngood many are not “true to name” and therefore form soils differing\r\nmaterially from the type just mentioned.\r\n\r\n    Thus the so-called granite areas of the Sierra Nevada of\r\n    California are largely occupied by a rock containing,\r\n    besides quartz, chiefly soda-lime feldspar and some\r\n    hornblende, and scarcely any mica. It is more properly\r\n    a diorite (grano-diorite); the soils formed from it are\r\n    rather poor in potash, not strongly calcareous, and quite\r\n    poor in phosphoric acid. On account of the small proportion\r\n    of hornblende (unusual in diorites), these soils are\r\n    light-colored (not “red”), and bear a growth of small pine\r\n    instead of the usual oak growth of the lower Sierra slopes.\r\n\r\nWhat is said of granite soils is also generally true of those formed\r\nfrom _Gneiss_, which is composed of the same minerals as granite,\r\nbut has a slaty cleavage and on that account when upturned on edge,\r\nweathers rather more rapidly than most granites. Owing to the frequent\r\noccurrence of lenticular masses of quartz in gneiss, its soils are\r\nmore commonly of a siliceous nature than are those of the true granite\r\nregions, and not as “strong” as the latter. This is the more true\r\nsince gneiss often passes gradually into _mica schist_, which, being a\r\nmixture of quartz and mica only, not only weathers very slowly but also\r\nsupplies but little of any importance to plants, to the soils formed\r\nfrom it. Such soils would mostly be absolutely barren but for the\r\nfrequent occurrence in the rock, of accessory minerals that yield some\r\nsubstance to the soil. Yet it remains true that inasmuch as gneiss and\r\nmica-schists are among the rocks in which mineral veins most commonly\r\noccur, the proverbial barrenness of mining districts is very frequently\r\ntraceable to these rocks. The same may be said of some of the related\r\nrocks, such as gabbro, minette and others.\r\n\r\nNormal _diorite_ consists of hornblende and soda-feldspar, with more or\r\nless quartz.\r\n\r\nThe soils derived from certain diorites of the Sierra Nevada of\r\nCalifornia have just been referred to. But these granite-like diorites\r\nare on the whole exceptional; it should be added that the (diabasic)\r\n“greenstones” of the Eastern United States and of the Old World, which\r\nare usually much finer-grained, do not form the mass of fine, angular\r\ndebris constituting the subsoil in the Sierra Nevada, but weather into\r\nrounded masses and fine-grained soils possessing, on the whole, a fair\r\nfertility, though liable to contain an excessive proportion of silex in\r\nvarious forms.\r\n\r\nOf the _eruptive rocks_ as a class it is often said that they form\r\nvery productive soils; yet, as these rocks differ widely from each\r\nother in composition, this statement must be taken with a great deal of\r\nallowance. Very many of them decompose with extreme slowness on account\r\nof their glassy nature; this is particularly true of obsidian, pumice\r\nstone, and the “volcanic ash” derived from its pulverization, and which\r\nis found unchanged, in sharp scales, among the decayed minerals of\r\nother rocks in complex soils. Other volcanic ash, however, being formed\r\nby the pulverization of crystalline or of basic lavas, weathers rather\r\nreadily, as already stated; so that certain plants take possession in\r\nthe course of a few years. The general classification into basic and\r\nacidic rocks, given above, is of importance in connection with soil\r\nformation from eruptive masses; for the basic rocks are much more\r\neasily attacked by the atmospheric agencies than the acidic class.\r\n\r\n    A broad distinction must, however, be made between the\r\n    basic rocks of the basaltic class, which contain black\r\n    pyroxene as a prominent ingredient, and those which, like\r\n    many trachytes, are rich in feldspathic minerals. The\r\n    latter are naturally rich in alkalies (potash and soda)\r\n    which they impart to the corresponding light-colored soils;\r\n    while the black basaltic rocks and lavas weather into “red”\r\n    soils, sometimes containing extraordinary amounts of iron\r\n    (ferric hydrate) and (from the lime-feldspars they contain)\r\n    a fair supply of lime, but oftentimes very little potash.\r\n    Experience seems to prove that the red basalt soils are\r\n    mostly rather rich in phosphoric acid; this is especially\r\n    true of the country covered by the great eruptive sheet of\r\n    the Pacific Northwest, in the rocks of which the microscope\r\n    readily detects the presence of numerous needles of\r\n    apatite (lime phosphate). The same is true of the highly\r\n    iron-bearing soils from the black basaltic lavas of the\r\n    Hawaiian islands, even though they have been leached of\r\n    all but traces of lime and potash. All these soils are\r\n    physically “light” and easily workable, since the rocks\r\n    in question contain but little alumina from which to form\r\n    clay; they are sometimes extremely rich in iron, even to the\r\n    extent of being capable of serving as iron ores.\r\n\r\nThe soils derived from _trachytes_ and trachytic lavas are generally\r\nlight-colored and light in texture; the latter from the presence of\r\na large proportion of volcanic glass, together with undecomposed\r\ncrystalline minerals. These are usually rich in potash, but poor in\r\nlime and phosphates. The high quality of the wines of the lower Rhine\r\nhas been ascribed to these soils, which however vary greatly within\r\nthe areal limits of the production of the high-grade wines, not only\r\nfrom gray trachytes to dark colored, highly augitic basalt, but also to\r\nacidic quartz porphyries or rhyolites, and clay-slates.\r\n\r\nThe rhyolites on the whole yield the poorest soils among the eruptive\r\nrocks; they are slow to weather at best, and the soils produced are\r\npoor and unsubstantial, largely from the predominance of quartz and\r\nundecomposable, glassy material; of which the phonolites are the\r\nextreme type, resisting the influence of the atmospheric agencies just\r\nas would so much artificial glass. Soils consisting largely of volcanic\r\nglass may be found covering considerable areas in the Sierra Nevada of\r\nCalifornia. Such “volcanic ash” soils are usually very unthrifty, and\r\nbear a growth of small pines.\r\n\r\n_Soils from sedimentary rocks._—_Limestones_, when pure and hard,\r\nare very slow to disintegrate, and are also very slowly attacked by\r\ncarbonated water (see chap. 3, page 41). Soft impure and vesicular\r\nlimestones are, however, very rapidly attacked, especially when\r\nunderlying a surface clothed with the luxuriant vegetation that usually\r\nflourishes on soils rich in lime. The popular adage that “a limestone\r\ncountry is a rich country,” is of almost universal application and\r\nstamps lime, from the purely practical standpoint, as one of the most\r\nimportant soil ingredients.\r\n\r\n_Residual Limestone Soils._—Striking examples of the formation of\r\nlarge, fertile soil areas by the leaching out of limestones are found\r\nin the States of Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas, where the\r\nfertile black prairies have been largely thus formed. The “blue-grass”\r\ncountry of Central Kentucky is another case in point.\r\n\r\nThe following table shows a representative example of the relative\r\ncomposition of the (cretaceous) “Rotten Limestone” of Mississippi, and\r\nthe “residual” soil-stratum derived from it. The average thickness of\r\nthe layer of residual clay above the limestone is about eight feet,\r\nbut ranges from seven to ten; the upper layers of the limestone are\r\nsomewhat softened, but the rock is always fresh at twelve feet, from\r\nwhich depth the sample analyzed was taken, in a cistern adjoining\r\nthe field from which the soil and subsoil were procured. The black\r\nsoil varies in depth from 8 to 15 inches; then there is a change to\r\na brownish subsoil, reaching down to about two feet, and in drying\r\ncleaving into prismatic fragments. The black soil has here in the\r\nhighest degree the peculiarity of crumbling in drying from its\r\nwater-soaked condition, so that it may be plowed when wet without\r\ninjury, although in the roads it works up into the toughest kind\r\nof mud. The prairie is sparsely timbered with compact, fair-sized\r\nblack-jack oak, accompanied originally by red cedar.\r\n\r\nThe limestone derives its popular name of “rotten” from its being\r\nusually soft enough to be cut with a knife or hatchet, and is therefore\r\nsomewhat used for building, and for burning lime.\r\n\r\n    COMPOSITION OF LIMESTONE, AND RESIDUAL SOIL AND SUBSOIL,\r\n          FROM BLACK PRAIRIE, MONROE CO., MISSISSIPPI.\r\n\r\n    ================================+============+=========+========\r\n                                    |  “ROTTEN   | SUBSOIL |  SOIL\r\n                                    |LIMESTONE.” |(YELLOW).|(BLACK).\r\n    --------------------------------+------------+---------+--------\r\n             FINE EARTH.            |Depth 12 ft.| 2-3 ft. |15 ins.\r\n    Chemical analysis of fine earth.|            |         |\r\n    --------------------------------+------------+---------+--------\r\n    Insoluble matter                |    10.90   |  71.54  |   78.29\r\n    Soluble silica                  |            |         |\r\n    Potash (K₂O)                   |      .25   |    .54  |     .33\r\n    Soda (Na₂O)                     |      .32   |    .23  |     .08\r\n    Lime (CaO)                      |    45.79   |   1.08  |    1.37\r\n    Magnesia (MgO)                  |      .88   |    .77  |     .36\r\n    Br.

Taking the average depth of\r\nthe soil mass at 8 feet, this thickness of material has required about\r\n45 feet of the rotten limestone. Considering that notwithstanding the\r\ntenacity of the clay soil, some of it must in the course of time have\r\nbeen washed away, we may safely assume that the original rock surface\r\nwas from 50 to 60 feet higher than at present.\r\n\r\n_Sandstone Soils._—The indefiniteness of the nature of “sandstones” as\r\nsuch renders generalizations in regard to the soils formed from them\r\nrather difficult, save as to their physical qualities, which in the\r\nnature of the case are always “light.” In the Old World and in the\r\nhumid region generally, sandstone and sandy soils are usually spoken\r\nof as being poor, because there the sand almost always consists of\r\nquartz grains only, and hence the fine portions alone can be looked to\r\nfor plant nutrition. Consequently, the more sand is seen in a soil,\r\nthe poorer it is usually presumed to be. But this presumption would be\r\nwholly erroneous in the arid regions. (See chapt. 6, p. 86).\r\n\r\nClearly, the nature of the soils produced by the weathering of\r\nsandstones depends upon two points: first, the nature of the cement\r\nbinding the sand grains, and second the character of the latter\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n_Varieties of Sandstones._—As has been stated above, the cements may\r\nbe roughly classified into five kinds, and their intermixtures, to\r\nwit: _quartzose_ or siliceous, _calcareous_, _ferruginous_, _aluminous\r\nor clayey_, and _zeolitic_. As regards the first, it is obvious\r\nthat siliceous sandstones will disintegrate with great difficulty,\r\nsince neither the cement nor the grains are susceptible of material\r\nchange by weathering. Such sandstones frequently pass insensibly\r\ninto quartz rock, and the light, unsubstantial soils they produce\r\nare of the poorest, containing often mere traces of the plant-food\r\ningredients. This of course, is true, not only of the soils formed by\r\nthe actual weathering of sandstones, but equally of those consisting of\r\nquartz-sand deposited by water or drifted by winds.\r\n\r\n    Of this character are the pine-forest soils of the coast\r\n    region of the Gulf of Mexico, particularly the “Sand\r\n    hammocks” of the immediate Gulf border, from Mississippi\r\n    Sound to Charlotte Harbor, Florida; the sandy lands of the\r\n    Grand Traverse region of Michigan, and many other minor\r\n    areas in the United States, usually characterized by a pine\r\n    growth, often more or less stunted, according to the nature\r\n    of the sand grains.\r\n\r\n_Calcareous sandstones_ usually form a very much better class of soils,\r\npartly for the intrinsic reason given above as regards limestones as\r\nsoil-formers. The calcareous cement is very rarely pure calcite; in\r\nmost cases it is very impure, as, most commonly, is also the “sand”\r\nitself. This is explained from the fact that such rocks (mostly soft\r\nand often quite unconsolidated) are, like limestones themselves, the\r\nresult of deposition in shallow seas or lakes, receiving deposits from\r\nthe land drainage, and enriched by the animal and vegetable life of\r\nsuch waters. Not uncommonly they contain, disseminated through them,\r\ngrains of the mineral glauconite (a hydrous silicate of iron and\r\npotash), which readily supplies available potash; while the remnants\r\nof animals and plants furnish more or less of available phosphates.\r\nThus the general presumption regarding calcareous sandstones is that\r\nthe derived soils are of good quality, frequently of the very best. The\r\nsame, however, does not appear to be true of sandstones cemented by\r\ndolomite; the soils derived from magnesian sandstones are in many cases\r\nnoted for their unproductiveness. (See chapt. 3, p. 42).\r\n\r\n_Ferruginous Sandstones_ manifestly derive no important soil\r\ningredients from their cement when the latter is measurably pure ferric\r\nhydrate; and when in addition the sand itself is purely siliceous, the\r\nsoils resulting from the disintegration of the rocks are very poor.\r\n\r\n    Such are, e.g., the soils derived from the ferruginous\r\n    sandstones of the Lafayette formation in a part of northern\r\n    Mississippi and adjacent portions of Tennessee and Alabama,\r\n    characterized by small scrubby oak or dwarfed pine. On the\r\n    whole, however, such purely ferruginous quartz sandstones\r\n    are exceptional, and should not detract from the favorable\r\n    inferences usually to be drawn from the iron-rust tint of\r\n    soils (see chapter 15).\r\n\r\nSandstones with purely _zeolitic_ cement are on the whole not of\r\nfrequent occurrence, the zeolites forming, more commonly, the hard\r\nportion of a clay-sandstone cement, which disintegrates by their\r\nweathering-out.\r\n\r\n    In regions where the tufaceous rocks of eruptives prevail,\r\n    we not uncommonly find the “volcanic ash” solidly cemented\r\n    by a zeolitic mass, which is then usually apparent in\r\n    cavities or crevices in the form of crusts or crystals. Such\r\n    tuffs are commonly rich in alkalies and lime, but mostly\r\n    poor in phosphates, and in disintegration form soils of a\r\n    corresponding nature. They are largely represented in the\r\n    valleys off Puget Sound, as well as in portions of central\r\n    Montana, and northward.\r\n\r\n_Clay-Sandstones_ (argillaceous sandstones) when soft, as is mostly\r\nthe case, form as a rule desirable loam soils, of a generalized\r\ncomposition, difficult to predict. It is here that the composition of\r\nthe sand grains themselves most frequently comes into play in modifying\r\nthe soil quality. From clay-sandstones to claystones of various degrees\r\nof sandiness there is, of course, every grade of transition, the soils\r\nranging correspondingly in the scale of lightness or clayeyness.\r\nAs a general rule, the potash contents of such soils are sensibly\r\nproportioned to the clayey ingredient, at least in the humid regions.\r\n\r\n_Claystones_ (i. e., clays hardened by some one or more of the cements\r\nmentioned in connection with sandstones), will in the nature of the\r\ncase, when disintegrated from the condition in which they lie in the\r\ngeological formations, make correspondingly clayey, heavy soils, which\r\nas experience shows are usually rich in the ingredients of plant food,\r\nbut frequently too heavy and intractable in tillage to be readily\r\nutilized.\r\n\r\n    There are, of course, exceptions; such as soils formed\r\n    from pipe-clays, in which little if any mineral plant-food\r\n    remains, and which are best used for other purposes than\r\n    agriculture, unless under special conditions it may be worth\r\n    while to reclaim them by fertilization.\r\n\r\n_Natural Clays._—Clays occur in nature in a great variety of\r\nmodifications that have received designations known in common life.\r\nSuch are porcelain clay, pipe-clay, fire-clay, potters’ clay,\r\nbrick-clay, and many others of more or less local use only. As these\r\nmaterials practically concern the farmer in very many cases, they may\r\nproperly find a brief discussion here.\r\n\r\nThe variety-names enumerated above in the order of the actual contents\r\nof the materials in true clay substance (“colloidal clay”), are partly\r\nbased upon that fact, partly upon the degree of plasticity attained\r\nby that substance, and essentially upon the nature and amount of\r\nforeign admixtures associated with it. Thus, porcelain clay is chalky\r\nkaolinite, sometimes associated with enough of pure white plastic\r\nclay to render it workable in the potter’s lathe, but more commonly\r\nrequiring to be molded in porous molds; it is very refractory to heat.\r\nPipe-clay is also white, but more plastic and usually less refactory.\r\nFire-clay is a refractory pipe-clay commingled with some coarse\r\ninfusible material, such as quartz sand (or the same clay burnt and\r\ncrushed), in order to prevent excessive contraction and change of shape\r\nin drying and burning. Potters’ clay is a much less pure, and from that\r\ncause more fusible clay, which when burnt forms at a moderate heat\r\na semi-fused, more or less hard mass, such as crockery and pottery\r\nware. Brick-clay is a still more impure clay, or loam, containing\r\nconsiderable sand and usually iron oxid, and largely falls already\r\nwithin the limits of tillable soils or subsoils, rendered fusible by\r\nthe presence of relatively considerable amounts of iron, magnesia and\r\nlime.\r\n\r\n    _Iron_ colors natural clays either red, yellow, green\r\n    or blue; the latter two colors turning to yellow or red on\r\n    exposure to the air, and to red on burning. Black color is\r\n    usually due to carbon, such clays often turning white on\r\n    heating.\r\n\r\n    Clays containing much lime are usually of a gray or whitish\r\n    tint, and like the soft crumbly limestones are often called\r\n    marls, and are used as such for land improvement. But it\r\n    should be understood that the colors of clays, mostly\r\n    derived from some iron compound, have little to do with\r\n    their uses in the arts, except that no deeply colored clay\r\n    (black excepted) is refractory in the fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n_“Colloidal” Clay._[17]\r\n\r\nIn connection with soils, clay may be defined, in the most general\r\nterms, as being the substance which imparts plasticity and adhesiveness\r\nto soils when wetted and kneaded, and which, when heated to redness,\r\nloses this property completely and permanently, becoming hard and\r\ncoherent in proportion to the degree of heat to which it is exposed.\r\n\r\n[17] This term was first employed by Th. Schloesing, in communications\r\nto the French Academy of Sciences, and reported in the Comptes Rendus\r\nof that body; first in 1870. Unaware of Schloesing’s work, the writer\r\nbegan a full investigation of the subject of mechanical soil analysis\r\nin 1871, and published the results in 1873 (Am. Jour. Sci., Oct. 1873).\r\nUp to that time the limited resources of the library of the University\r\nof Mississippi had not given him an opportunity to see Schloesing’s\r\npublication. The two independent investigations, though conducted on\r\nsomewhat different lines, gave of course practically the same results,\r\nand complement each other.\r\n\r\nIn common life, however, the name is applied to the whole of any\r\nnaturally occurring earth which on wetting and kneading assumes a\r\nreasonable degree of plasticity and adhesiveness. When the latter\r\nproperty becomes nearly or quite insensible, the earth is designated as\r\na “loam,” more or less “clayey” according to the amount of the pure,\r\nplastic and adhesive material associated with the mineral powders and\r\nsand that form the bulk of most soils.\r\n\r\nChemically, the pure clay substance[18] probably consists (as has been\r\nstated above) of silica and alumina in the proportion of nearly 46 to\r\n40, the rest (14%) being water of hydration, which is lost on burning\r\nthe clayey material. But while it is true that such is the composition\r\nof the plastic substance of clays, plasticity and adhesiveness are by\r\nno means invariable properties of this compound. In its purest state,\r\nas kaolinite, it is readily mistaken for chalk, (and is sometimes\r\nused as such), being powdery to the touch and entirely devoid of\r\nplasticity[19] when wetted and kneaded. The microscope shows this\r\nchalky kaolinite to consist of minute, mostly rounded, originally\r\nsix-sided, thin plates, which when pure resemble to the touch powdered\r\ntalc (soapstone) or even black-lead, rather than any clay known to\r\ncommon life. But being exceedingly soft, the kaolinite substance\r\nis easily ground or triturated into an extremely fine powder; and\r\nJohnson and Blake[20] succeeded in producing sensible plasticity and\r\nadhesiveness by long-continued trituration of kaolinite with water in a\r\nmortar. A similar process, but continued much longer by the mechanical\r\nagencies concerned in soil-formation (see chapt. I), is unquestionably\r\nthe chief factor concerned in the formation of natural plastic clays;\r\nbut whether this is the _only_ process by which the powdery kaolinite\r\nmay be transformed into plastic clay, is a question not definitely\r\nsettled. It is at least possible that repeated freezing and thawing, as\r\nwell as the action of hot water, may take a part in the transformation,\r\nbeyond that by which they destroy the crumbly (flocculated) structure\r\nof soils and clays, and render them plastic; as is done in the maturing\r\nof clays by potters.\r\n\r\n[18] There is still some discussion as to the chemical identity of\r\ncolloidal clay with Kaolinite; but the objections are not convincing.\r\n\r\n[19] It has of late been attempted to extend the meaning of this\r\nword to the behavior of all powders when wetted with water. But the\r\nadhesive plasticity of clay stands almost alone, in that (aside\r\nfrom contraction) it preserves in drying the form into which it may\r\nhave been molded while wet, even when struck, whereas other powdery\r\nsubstances similarly treated at once collapse back into the original\r\npowder. The exclusive use of clay in modeling offers the typical\r\nexample of plasticity as generally understood. The addition of any\r\npowdery substance, however fine, diminishes the plasticity of clay.\r\n\r\n[20] American Journal of Science, 2d Ser., Vol. 43, p. 357.\r\n\r\n_Causes of Plasticity._—In any case the property of plasticity and\r\nadhesiveness is restricted to the particles so fine that they fail to\r\nsettle, in the course of 24 hours, through a column of pure water eight\r\ninches (200 m) high, while some are so extremely minute that they will\r\nnot settle for many months, and even for several years.[21] Such turbid\r\n“clay water” may sometimes be found existing in nature, in moist,\r\nsecluded places, for weeks after the subsidence of the overflows of\r\nrivers whose water is exceptionally free from dissolved mineral matter.\r\n\r\n[21] Williams (Forsch. Agr. Phys. Vol. 18, p. 225 ff.) claims that\r\nthe diameter of the minutest clay particles is one-thousandth of\r\na millimeter, their form being that of scales showing continual\r\n(Brownian) motion in water. He maintains that the plasticity of clay\r\nis due to this minute size, and this view has gained wide acceptance\r\nin late works on the subject. But this assumption cannot be maintained\r\nin the face of the fact that nothing like the adhesive plasticity of\r\nclay can be attained even by the finest powders of other substances,\r\nleast of all by those having the closest mineralogical resemblance to\r\nkaolinite, such as graphite and talc. Above all, the most persistent\r\ntrituration with water utterly falls to restore plasticity to clay once\r\nbaked so as to expel its water of hydration, although the fineness\r\nof the particles is thereby not only not diminished, but actually\r\nincreased, by contraction in heating. No powders however fine can\r\nreplace the functions of clay in soils, _viz._ the maintenance of\r\nfloccules, and tilth dependent thereupon; and they distinctly impair\r\nthe plasticity of clay. The fine “slickens” of quartz mills merely\r\nrender soils containing them more close and impervious, and more\r\ndifficult to flocculate. Even gelatinous masses like hydrated ferric\r\nand aluminic oxids fail to replace clay in its adhesive functions.\r\n\r\n    _Separation of Colloidal Clay._—This property of\r\n    the plastic clay substance, of diffusing in pure water,\r\n    furnishes the means of separating from it the coarser, sandy\r\n    and silty portions of soils and natural clays, and observing\r\n    its characteristic properties, so far as the almost\r\n    unavoidable admixture of some other substances, presently to\r\n    be considered, permits.\r\n\r\n    In natural soils the clay particles usually incrust the\r\n    powdery ingredients, cementing them together; or themselves\r\n    form complex aggregates (floccules) of large numbers\r\n    of individual particles. These may be loosened from\r\n    their adhesion or cohesion either by prolonged, gentle\r\n    kneading of the wet clay, or by more or less prolonged\r\n    digestion (soaking) in hot water, or more expeditiously,\r\n    by lively boiling with water. The boiling should not,\r\n    however, be prolonged beyond the time actually required\r\n    for disintegration, since (as Osborne[22] has shown)\r\n    long-protracted boiling tends to render the clay permanently\r\n    less diffusible.\r\n\r\n    From the turbid clay-water the diffused clay may be obtained\r\n    either by evaporating the water (which as the bulk is very\r\n    large, is usually inconvenient), or, more conveniently,\r\n    by throwing it down from its suspension by the action of\r\n    certain substances which possess the property of curdling\r\n    (coagulating) the clay substance into flocculent masses\r\n    that settle quickly. Of all known substances, lime, in the\r\n    form of lime-water, acts most energetically in producing\r\n    this change; but other solutions of lime, as well as most\r\n    salts and mineral acids, produce the same effects when\r\n    used in sufficient quantity. Common salt is among the most\r\n    convenient, because it can most readily be leached out of\r\n    the clay precipitate thus thrown down. This when white,\r\n    resembles boiled starch, but being usually colored by iron\r\n    might be easily mistaken for the mixed precipitate of ferric\r\n    hydrate and alumina so commonly obtained by chemists in\r\n    soil analysis. When separated from the water and dried,\r\n    the jelly-like substance (“colloidal clay”) shrinks as\r\n    extravagantly as would so much boiled starch, into hard,\r\n    shiny crusts or flakes, which when struck in mass are\r\n    sometimes even resonant, and bear more resemblance to glue\r\n    than to the clay of everyday life. Like glue, too, but much\r\n    more quickly and tenaciously, the dried colloidal clay\r\n    adheres to the tongue, so as to render the separation\r\n    painful; when wetted it quickly bulges with great energy,\r\n    and in a short time resumes its former jelly-like condition.\r\n    When moistened with less water it assumes a highly plastic\r\n    and adhesive condition, so that it is difficult to handle\r\n    and almost as sure to soil the operator’s hands as so much\r\n    pitch.\r\n\r\n[22] Rep. Conn. Agr. Expt. Stn., 1886, 1887.\r\n\r\n_Effects of Alkali Carbonates upon Clay._—The carbonate of potash and\r\nsoda, when in very dilute solution (.01 to .05%) exert upon diffused\r\nclay an effect the reverse of the acids and neutral salts. They destroy\r\nthe flocculent aggregates formed by precipitation with these, or\r\nnaturally existing in the soil, and tend to puddle the clay so as to\r\nrender it impervious to water. It is thus that in the alkali lands of\r\nthe arid regions we often find the soil or subsoil consolidated into\r\na very refractory “hardpan,” difficult to break even with a sledge\r\nhammer and impossible to reduce to tilth until the alkali carbonate is\r\ndestroyed by means of a lime salt, such as gypsum. (See chapt. 23).\r\nAmmonia water also helps to cause the diffusion of clay in water, but\r\nits effect of course disappears upon drying. It is probable that this\r\nproperty of sodic carbonate can be utilized in rendering earth dams\r\nfirmer and more secure against the penetration of water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE MINOR MINERALINGREDIENTS OF SOILS; MINERAL FERTILIZERS; MINERALS\r\nINJURIOUS TO AGRICULTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\n(A.) MINERALS USED AS FERTILIZERS.\r\n\r\nOf minerals important in soil-formation, not usually present in large\r\namounts in rocks, but extensively used in fertilization, the following\r\nrequire mention:\r\n\r\n_Apatite_; phosphate of lime containing more or less of the chlorids\r\nand fluorids of the same metal; the mineral from which the phosphoric\r\nacid of the soil is mostly derived. In the crystallized condition when\r\nperfectly pure it is colorless; but it is mostly of a greenish tint\r\n(hence “asparagus stone”). The pure crystalline mineral rarely occurs\r\nin large masses (as in Canada); but small to minute crystals are found\r\nwidely disseminated in many rocks (granites, “basalts” of the Pacific\r\nNorthwest), thus passing into the soils formed from these rocks. These\r\ncrystals are readily recognized, being regular six-sided prisms with a\r\nflat or obtusely pyramidal termination (distinction from quartz), and\r\ndo not effervesce with acids (distinction from calcite). By far the\r\nlargest deposits of this mineral occur in connection with carbonate of\r\nlime, in the rock materials known as _phosphorites_. Lime phosphate\r\nbeing, like the carbonate, soluble in carbonated water, the two\r\nnaturally frequently pass into solution, and are subsequently deposited\r\ntogether. Most limestones contain a small proportion of lime phosphate,\r\nbeing, as already stated, formed from the shells and the framework of\r\nanimal organisms usually containing also phosphates. But the content of\r\nphosphates in limestones is not readily apparent to the eye, and the\r\nrichest deposits, save such as contain animal bones, have long passed\r\nunsuspected as to their being anything else but limestone. Systematic\r\nsearch has now revealed the presence of phosphate rock in numerous\r\nlocalities, chiefly where limestone formations occur. In the United\r\nStates, in South Carolina, Florida, Alabama, Tennessee, Kentucky,\r\nNevada; in South America, on Curaçoa island, Venezuela; in the Antilles\r\non Sombrero, St. Martins and Navassa islands. In Africa, in Algiers and\r\nTunisia; in Europe, in Spain (Estremadura, one of the first deposits\r\nknown), France, Belgium and the adjacent parts of Germany; in Bohemia\r\nand Galicia in Austria; and very extendedly in European Russia. Many\r\nislands of Oceanica supply phosphorites derived from the decomposition\r\nof bird guano by the coral limestone.\r\n\r\n    Unfortunately the percentage of phosphate in a large\r\n    proportion of these materials is not sufficiently high to\r\n    make their conversion into water-soluble superphosphate\r\n    economically possible at the present time; since all the\r\n    calcic carbonate present must also be converted into\r\n    comparatively worthless sulphate (gypsum) by the use of\r\n    sulfuric acid; and as yet no practicable method for avoiding\r\n    this difficulty has been found.\r\n\r\n    “_Thomas Slag._”—Probably the nearest approach to such\r\n    a method is indicated by the fact that a compound containing\r\n    four instead of three molecules of lime to one of P₂O₅, such\r\n    as is contained in the “Thomas slag” of the basic process of\r\n    steel manufacture, is nearly or in some cases (“sour” soils)\r\n    _quite_ as effective for the nutrition of plants as the\r\n    water-soluble superphosphate. This discovery has rendered\r\n    available for agricultural use the phosphoric acid contained\r\n    in the enormous deposits of limonite iron ore known as bog\r\n    ore, which contains a large proportion of ferric phosphate\r\n    and from that cause has until lately been excluded from the\r\n    manufacture of wrought iron and steel. It is reasonable\r\n    to hope that by some analogous process the low-grade\r\n    phosphorites, such as those of Nevada and the plains of\r\n    Russia, will also in the course of time become available\r\n    for agricultural use. Extremely fine grinding and washing\r\n    (producing “floats”) has been resorted to for the purpose of\r\n    rendering the raw phosphorites effective in fertilization.\r\n    But while this is successful on some soils, on others the\r\n    “floats” remain almost inert; so that this method has found\r\n    only limited acceptance.\r\n\r\n_Animal bones_, which consist of from 24 to 30% of animal substance and\r\n70 to 76% of “bone earth,” (or when fossil are free from the former),\r\nare largely used for the manufacture of superphosphate. The bone-earth\r\nconsists in the main of tri-calcic phosphate with from one to two per\r\ncent of calcium fluorid (much as in natural apatite), a small amount of\r\nmagnesic phosphate, and about 4 to 6% of calcic carbonate. Bone meal\r\ncan therefore supply to plants both phosphoric acid and nitrogen, and\r\nthe presence of the latter has been largely the cause of a material\r\noverestimate of its efficacy as a fertilizer in the past. Wagner’s and\r\nMaerker’s experiments have shown that at least in sandy soils poor in\r\nhumus, it cannot be considered an adequate source of phosphoric acid\r\nfor annual crops, and that in these soils its immediate effects are\r\nalmost wholly due to its nitrogen-content. The slow availability of\r\nthe phosphoric acid renders it unprofitable as a source of the latter,\r\noutside of the heavier lands with abundance of humus; in “sour” lands\r\n(notably on meadows) bone meal produces its best results. In soils\r\nnaturally calcareous, or in such as have received heavy dressings of\r\nlime either as carbonate or in the caustic condition, the manurial\r\neffects of bone meal are seriously diminished. Nagaoka (Bull. Coll.\r\nAgr. Tokyo, Vol. 6, No. 3) shows that the crop of rice fertilized\r\nwith bone meal was reduced to less than half when limed, and that the\r\nphosphoric acid taken up by the crop was reduced to one-sixth. In any\r\ncase it is most important that bone meal should be as finely ground as\r\npossible, as in the case of the phosphorites; and this can best be done\r\nwhen it has first been freed from fats by boiling with water, and then\r\nsteamed under pressure. It can then also be most readily converted into\r\nsuperphosphate.\r\n\r\nThe phosphate minerals and the fertilizers manufactured therefrom are\r\nof primary importance to agriculture. The phosphoric-acid content of\r\nsoils is mostly very small, and only a fraction of it is usually in\r\nan immediately available form. Hence for permanent productiveness,\r\nand especially for intensive farming or gardening, a cheap supply of\r\nphosphate fertilizers is of first importance in all soils and climates.\r\n\r\nOther phosphate minerals occur frequently, but as a rule only in small\r\namounts, in connection with the ores of most metals. The only ones\r\nof these of interest to agriculture are _Vivianite_ and _Dufrenite_,\r\nthe phosphates respectively of the protoxid and peroxid of iron. The\r\nformer occurs in mineral deposits as small blue crystals, or more\r\nfrequently as blue earthy masses or streaks, in the substrata of rich\r\nalluvial ground (Louisiana, California). Dufrenite sometimes results\r\ndirectly from the oxidation of the protoxid mineral, which then turns\r\ngreenish and finally brown. Unfortunately these minerals, rich as\r\nthey are in phosphoric acid, cannot readily be utilized as sources of\r\nphosphate fertilizers, because of the difficulty of getting rid of the\r\niron. Their occurrence usually suggests the presence of abundance of\r\nphosphoric acid in the soil. But that which is actually combined with\r\nthe iron oxids is practically unavailable to plants; especially so in\r\nthe case of the peroxid compound, the formation of which is a common\r\nsource of loss of phosphoric acid when soils rich in iron are submerged\r\nfor any length of time; a point which is discussed below (chapt. 13).\r\n\r\nAmong the iron phosphate minerals, may also be mentioned “bog ore,”\r\nwhich results from the reductive maceration of swamped ferruginous\r\nsoils, and accumulates in the subsoils and in the bottom of swamps or\r\nmoors, forming “moorbedpan”; a dark brown, rather soft mass, which is\r\nsometimes used as an iron ore, especially since the invention of the\r\n“basic process” of iron smelting, one of the products of which is the\r\nphosphate or Thomas slag. (See above).\r\n\r\n_Nitrate of Soda or Chile saltpeter._—This mineral being (like all\r\nnitrates) easily soluble in water, can only occur in regions nearly\r\nor quite destitute of rainfall. Such is the case in the Plateau of\r\nTarapacà in Northern Chile, where it occurs in large quantities; it\r\nis likewise found, but to much smaller extent, in Nevada, southern\r\nCalifornia, Egypt and India. By far its most extended occurrence is\r\nthat in Chile, where, together with common salt, it fills cavities and\r\ncrevices in a gravelly clay that forms the surface of a plateau from\r\nthree to six thousand feet above the sea. It is never pure, but always\r\nmingled with a large proportion (up to 50% and over) of common salt;\r\nalso some Glauber’s salt (sulfate of soda) and some sodic perchlorate\r\nand iodid; hence it forms an important commercial source of iodine.\r\n\r\n    The mixed mineral mass, called “Caliche,” when taken out\r\n    of the ground is dissolved in water; and the solution\r\n    boiled down, during which process the common salt is first\r\n    deposited and is raked out of the pans; the nitrate is\r\n    afterward farther purified by crystallization. As brought\r\n    into commerce for agricultural purposes it constitutes a\r\n    moist gray saline mass, somewhat resembling common salt,\r\n    of which substance it usually contains a few per cent;\r\n    occasionally also a small amount of sodic perchlorate (which\r\n    acts injuriously on vegetation). Aside from its use as a\r\n    fertilizer, Chile saltpeter serves for the manufacture\r\n    of nitric acid; and either directly, or after previous\r\n    transformation into potassic nitrate, for that of gunpowder.\r\n\r\n    The Chilean locality is the only one from which the\r\n    commercial article is derived; the deposits elsewhere are\r\n    too limited in extent to compete commercially with the South\r\n    American product. Caliche ranging as high as 80% of nitrate\r\n    of soda has been sent to the writer from the Colorado\r\n    Desert in Southern California, but the exact locality of\r\n    occurrence has not been divulged. Extended areas of clay\r\n    hills impregnated with nitrates exist in the Death Valley\r\n    region of California, but in the absence or extreme scarcity\r\n    of water in that region, it is doubtful whether these\r\n    impregnations can be made practically available. Another\r\n    locality is that near White Plains, Nevada, where Caliche\r\n    averaging about 50% purity is found in cavities and crevices\r\n    of a reddish volcanic rock. The rainfall in this region is\r\n    so slight that the greater part of the dust or sand blown\r\n    about by the wind consists of Glauber’s salt. Here also,\r\n    as in Chile, the niter deposits appear to be restricted to\r\n    within a short distance from the surface, and the total\r\n    amount thus far observed appears to be insufficient to\r\n    encourage large-scale exploitation.\r\n\r\n    _Origin of Nitrate Deposits._—The probable origin\r\n    of these niter deposits has given rise to a great deal of\r\n    discussion, and a wide difference of opinion exists as\r\n    to the source from which the nitrogen may reasonably be\r\n    supposed to have been derived. According to the present\r\n    state of our knowledge, it must be presumed that its\r\n    sources have been organic, and that the niter has been\r\n    produced by the activity of the same bacteria which now\r\n    produce nitrates in our soils, rendering the nitrogen of\r\n    humus available to plants. But it is by no means clear what\r\n    that organic material could have been; for at the present\r\n    time the plateau of Tarapacà is almost wholly destitute of\r\n    vegetation, if not of animal life. The latest and apparently\r\n    most reasonable suggestion is that of _Kuntze_, who\r\n    calls attention to the fact that the vicuñas and llamas\r\n    which are at home in this portion of the Andes, and are\r\n    known to have roamed over that region in countless herds,\r\n    have the curious habit of always depositing their manure in\r\n    one and the same place whenever at liberty. Each herd\r\n    of these animals has its definite dunging place at some\r\n    convenient point. That such herds have existed in the region\r\n    from time immemorial is obvious from historical as well as\r\n    collateral evidence; and as their manure accumulated, its\r\n    nitrification would progress rapidly under the prevailing\r\n    arid conditions. The common salt would naturally be derived\r\n    from the urine and excrements, and the alkaline salts\r\n    which exist throughout this region as the products of soil\r\n    decomposition, would be quite sufficient to account for\r\n    the alkaline bases in the caliche. On the other hand, the\r\n    presence of iodine points to seaweeds as the organic source.\r\n\r\n_Intensity of Nitrification in Arid Climates._—Of the efficacy of\r\nnitrification under arid conditions abundant evidence may be found\r\nwithin the State of California. In the alkali lands of southern\r\nCalifornia the nitrates of soda, lime and magnesia are almost\r\nuniversally present; they form at times as much as one-fifth and even\r\nmore of the entire mass of alkali salts, and in one case the total\r\namount in the soil has been found to reach two tons per acre, with\r\nan average of twelve hundred pounds over ten acres. In the plains of\r\nthe San Joaquin Valley, spots strongly impregnated with niter are\r\nfound, especially under the shadows of isolated oak trees, where the\r\ncattle have been in the habit of congregating for a long time; a case\r\nquite analogous to that supposed by _Kuntze_ to exist in the Chilean\r\nlocality. Of course it is only in arid climates that the accumulation\r\nof nitrates can usually occur; for in the region of summer rains the\r\nnitrates formed during the warm season will inevitably be washed into\r\nthe subdrainage, unless restrained by absorption by the roots of\r\nvegetation. The heavy losses occasionally occurring from this cause in\r\nthe course of a rainy winter on summer-fallowed land have been amply\r\ndemonstrated by many investigations.\r\n\r\nPOTASH MINERALS.—By far the most abundant occurrence of potash in the\r\nearth’s crust is that in silicates and notably in orthoclase or potash\r\nfeldspar, which contributes so largely to soil-formation. But in the\r\nabsence of any economically successful artificial method for producing\r\npotash compounds from feldspars on a commercial scale, almost the\r\nentire supply of potash salts was, until a comparatively late period,\r\nderived from plant ashes, viz., the “potashes” of commerce. At the\r\nsame time, almost the entire demand for alkalies for industrial uses\r\nbore upon the same product, until the invention, toward the end of the\r\nlast century, of _LeBlanc’s_ process for the manufacture of soda from\r\ncommon salt; for until that time, soda in the various forms in which\r\nit was imported from the Orient or prepared from seaweed ashes, was a\r\ncomparatively costly product. LeBlanc’s invention was most timely in\r\nthat it very quickly diminished materially the production of potashes\r\nwhich, in view of the increased demand for alkalies for industrial\r\nuses, seriously threatened the depletion of agricultural lands, and of\r\nwoodlands as well, of one of its most essential ingredients. Yet as\r\nthere are many industrial uses in which soda cannot replace potash,\r\nthe manufacture of potashes continued to a greater or less extent, as\r\nno other available source except the ashes of land plants, was then\r\nknown. The production of potassic chlorid from the mother-waters of sea\r\nsalt in the spontaneous evaporation of sea water for the manufacture\r\nof common salt, was on too small a scale to influence materially the\r\nmanufacture of potashes.\r\n\r\n_Discovery of Stassfurt Salts._—The depletion of potash had become so\r\nserious a matter in the agricultural lands of Europe, that for a time\r\nmuch research was bestowed, and prizes offered for an economical method\r\nof producing potash salts from feldspar, on a commercial scale. But\r\nthe problem had not been satisfactory solved when, in the year 1860,\r\nattention was called to the fact that the saline deposits overlying\r\ncertain large rock-salt beds that had been developed by borings near\r\nStassfurt in Prussia, contained so large a proportion of potash\r\nsalts, as to render their purification and conversion into fairly\r\npure sulphate and chlorid technically feasible. The impulse having\r\nbeen given, the potash industry developed rapidly in that region as\r\nwell as in the adjacent portions of Saxony, where the same formation\r\nunderlies; the production of “Stassfurt Salts” rapidly assumed a\r\ngreater development than that of the rock-salt which had originally\r\nprompted the enterprise, and numerous additional boreholes demonstrated\r\nan unexpectedly wide extension of the same beds. At the present time,\r\nin consequence of such development, the manufacture of potashes from\r\nplant ash has almost ceased, outside of Canada and Hungary; and the\r\nproduction of potash salts in the Stassfurt region now supplies the\r\ndemand of the entire world, both for industrial and agricultural\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nThe cheapening of potash as a fertilizer has rendered possible the\r\nprofitable cultivation of large areas of land which were naturally\r\ntoo poor in that substance for ordinary cultures; and has likewise\r\nrendered possible the restoration to general culture of lands that\r\nhad ceased to produce adequately, on account of the depletion caused\r\nby long-continued cropping. It has likewise served to intensify\r\nagricultural production wherever desired; and between this supply and\r\nthat of phosphoric acid from the phosphorites (see above), and the\r\ndiscovery of the nitrogen-absorbing power of leguminous plants, which\r\ncan be used for green-manuring, farmers have been enabled to dispense,\r\nin many regions, with the production and use of stable-manure, which\r\nuntil then had been considered an indispensable adjunct to agriculture\r\neverywhere. Even within the last fifty years it was proclaimed by high\r\nauthority in Germany that stable-manure constituted, as it were, the\r\nfarmer’s raw material, from which he manufactured the various products\r\nof the field through the intervention of the plant-producing power of\r\nthe soil.\r\n\r\n    _Origin of the Potash Deposits._—The manner in which\r\n    this accumulation of potash salts has been formed deserves\r\n    explanation. It is abundantly evident that nearly all\r\n    deposits of rock-salt thus far known have been formed by the\r\n    evaporation of sea-water at times when bays or arms of the\r\n    sea were cut off from open communication with the ocean.\r\n    The composition of sea-water has already been given and\r\n    discussed (chap. 2, p. 26); and by the slow evaporation of\r\n    sea-water on a small scale we can quite successfully imitate\r\n    the phenomena observed in natural rock-salt deposits. When\r\n    sea-water is heated a slight deposit of lime carbonate\r\n    (usually containing a little ferric oxid and silica) is soon\r\n    formed; and a corresponding thin deposit of ferruginous\r\n    limestone is commonly found at the base of rock-salt-bearing\r\n    deposits. Next above this we almost invariably find a\r\n    deposit of gypsum, sometimes of great thickness; in the\r\n    artificial evaporation of sea-water the same thing occurs\r\n    so soon as the brine has reached a certain degree of\r\n    concentration. It constitutes the major portion of the\r\n    “panstone” of salt-boilers. Next above follows a deposit of\r\n    rock-salt, at base somewhat mixed with gypsum; its thickness\r\n    varies greatly according to circumstances. Above it lie the\r\n    potash salts.\r\n\r\n    In the manufacture of sea-salt by evaporation in shore\r\n    lagoons or “saltpans,” the solution remaining after the salt\r\n    has been deposited (known as “mother-waters,” or “bittern”),\r\n    of course remains on the surface of the salt unless allowed\r\n    to drain off, as is done in the process of manufacture. When\r\n    not drained off, the water gradually evaporates, and there\r\n    remains a saline crust of a composition exactly resembling\r\n    that of the upper layers at Stassfurt, containing a large\r\n    proportion of potash salts.\r\n\r\n    If it be asked why the Stassfurt salts are not found\r\n    overlying every rock-salt deposit in the world, the answer\r\n    is that in a great many cases the concentrated mother-waters\r\n    have had an opportunity to flow off from the surface of the\r\n    rock-salt by the action of tides, the inflow of fresh water\r\n    from the land or from other causes. Their presence therefore\r\n    depends upon the fulfilment of accidental conditions not\r\n    nearly always realized in the natural evaporation of\r\n    sea-water, but which happened to occur on a very large scale\r\n    in that portion of the North-European continent.\r\n\r\n    _Nature of the Salts._—The potash is present in\r\n    the Stassfurt salts in the form of complex sulfates and\r\n    chlorids containing, besides, sodium, calcium and magnesium\r\n    in various proportions and modes of combination. The most\r\n    abundant of the potassic chlorid minerals is carnallite, a\r\n    hydrous chlorid of potassium and magnesium. The chlorids\r\n    characterize chiefly the upper portions of the deposit, the\r\n    sulfates the lower.\r\n\r\n_Kainit._—Of the products derived from the Stassfurt salt industry\r\nfor agricultural use, the two requiring special consideration are\r\n“kainit,” a natural mixture of the several chlorid minerals in varying\r\nproportions; and “high-grade sulfate.” Being a natural product,\r\n“kainit” is the cheapest source of potash available to the farmer;\r\nbut on account of its variability in composition it must be sold\r\nand purchased on guaranteed assay. On account of its large content\r\nof chlorin it is not desirable in the production of certain crops,\r\nespecially in the arid region, where alkali soils, and even those not\r\nvisibly alkaline, often contain already large amounts of chlorin.\r\nMoreover, kainit usually contains a considerable proportion of\r\ncommon salt. For the arid region therefore the sulfate is generally\r\npreferable, although it is somewhat higher in price for the same\r\namount of potash. The potash content of commercial kainit (calculated\r\nas K₂O) ranges from 16 to 35%, while the sulphate frequently ranges\r\nfrom 80 up to 95% of the pure sulfate; thus costing materially less in\r\nfreight charges than the lower-grade kainit. Its potash content ranges\r\nfrom 43 to over 50% of K₂O.\r\n\r\n_Potash Salts in Alkali Soils._—The sulfates and chlorids of potassium,\r\nhowever, occur not only in connection with rock-salt deposits, but are\r\nalso found in the alkali soils of the arid region. They are, in fact,\r\nnever absent where such salts occur at all, and their percentage in the\r\ntotal of salts ranges all the way from about 4 to as much as 20% of\r\npotash sulphate. In numerous cases it has been found that the content\r\nof this salt to the depth of four feet amounts to from 1200 to 1500\r\npounds per acre. In such lands, of course, additional fertilization\r\nwith potash salts is totally uncalled for, the more as such soils\r\ninvariably contain, besides the water-soluble potash, an unusually\r\nlarge percentage of the same in the form of easily decomposable\r\nsilicates, or zeolites.\r\n\r\n_Farmyard or Stable Manure._—In connection with the subject of mineral\r\nfertilizers, it will be proper to discuss briefly the uses and special\r\nmerits of stable manure, composts, etc. Up to within the last century,\r\nthese were practically the only fertilizers known and used, and the\r\nexclusive use of this manure might have continued indefinitely but for\r\nthe discovery that as time progressed, stable manure and with it grain\r\ncrops, for the production of which it was necessary, became less and\r\nless in amount, so as to threaten bread famines. The cause of this\r\ndiminution was, of course, the incompleteness of the return of the\r\nsoil-ingredients taken off by the crops, when these were exported to\r\nfeed the cities or foreign countries. Thus the attention of chemists,\r\nand notably that of Liebig, was attracted to the solution of the\r\nproblem of keeping up production even with an insufficient supply of\r\nstable manure; and the discovery of the use of mineral fertilizers was\r\nthe result of their activity.\r\n\r\nThe chemical composition of stable manure does not, alone, suffice to\r\nexplain its remarkable efficacy and the difficulty of replacing it\r\nby any other material. The composition of manure of course differs\r\nnot only with different animals but also with the different feeds\r\nconsumed by them; but the average composition of farmyard manure is\r\napproximately given thus by Wolff and others:\r\n\r\n                ANALYSES OF VARIOUS FARMYARD MANURES.\r\n\r\n    ==========================================================\r\n                    |   1.  |   2.  |   3.  |    4.    |   5.\r\n                    |       |       |       |          |\r\n    Water           | 71.00 | 75.00 | 79.00 |  79.95   | 72.33\r\n    Dry Matter      | 29.00 | 25.00 | 21.00 |  20.05   | 27.67\r\n    Ash ingredients |  4.40 |  5.80 |  6.50 |          |  5.87\r\n    Potash          |  0.52 |  0.63 |  0.50 |  0.84[23]|  0.69\r\n    Lime            |  0.57 |  0.70 |  0.88 |          |  0.85\r\n    Magnesia        |  0.14 |  0.18 |  0.18 |          |  0.14\r\n    Phosphoric acid |  0.21 |  0.26 |  0.30 |   0.40   |  0.30\r\n    Ammonia         |       |       |       |          |  0.02\r\n    Total Nitrogen  |  0.45 |  0.50 |  0.58 |   0.78   |  0.46\r\n    ----------------+-------+-------+-------+----------+-------\r\n\r\n    1.

Mixed cow and horse manure from a bed two feet thick, accumulated\r\n       during the winter in a large covered yard, and packed solid by\r\n       the tramping of cattle (The analysis by F. E. Furry).\r\n\r\n    5. “Box Manure,” consisting of mixed manure of bullocks, horses, and\r\n       pigs (Way, Royal Agric. Soc. Journ., 1850, II., 769).\r\n\r\n[23] And soda.\r\n\r\nIt is thus seen that the percentage of the important plant-foods in\r\nstable manure are minute when compared with those commonly found in\r\n“commercial” fertilizers. Nor are they so much more available for plant\r\nabsorption than the latter; a very large proportion is not utilized\r\nat all the first year, and unless the amount applied is very large it\r\nhardly carries the supply needed for the usual crops.\r\n\r\nIt is now well understood that its efficacy is largely due to the\r\nimportant physical effects it produces in the soil. It helps directly\r\nto render heavy clay soils more loose and readily tillable. If well\r\n“rotted” or cured it also serves to render sandy, leachy soils more\r\nretentive of moisture; and the humus formed in its progressive decay\r\nimparts to all soils the highly important qualities discussed later on\r\n(chapt. 8). More than this, the later researches have shown that stable\r\nmanure acts perhaps most immediately upon the bacterial activity in the\r\nsoil, greatly increasing it not only directly by the vast numbers of\r\nthese organisms it brings with it, but also in supplying appropriate\r\nfood for those normally existing in the soil (see chapt. 9). In\r\nso doing it serves indirectly to render the soil ingredients more\r\navailable, and to impart to the soil the loose condition required in a\r\ngood seed-bed—a “tilth” which cannot be brought about by the operations\r\nof tillage alone.\r\n\r\nThe only possible substitute for the use of stable manure is found\r\nin green-manuring with leguminous crops conjointly with the use of\r\ncommercial or mineral fertilizers. Unless this is done the use of the\r\nlatter, alone, ultimately leads to a depletion of humus substances,\r\nwhich renders the acquisition of proper tilth by the seed-bed\r\nimpossible, and causes a compacting of the surface soil which no\r\ntillage can remedy.\r\n\r\n_Proper method of using stable manure in humid and arid climates._—In\r\nthe humid region it is a common practice to spread the stable manure\r\non the surface of the fields and leave it there without any special\r\noperation to put it into the soil; trusting to the rains, earthworms\r\nand subsequent tillage for its being brought into adequate contact\r\nwith the roots; it is rarely plowed in. In the arid region this\r\nmode of using it is impracticable; it would remain on the surface\r\nindefinitely without advancing in its decay because of the dryness, and\r\nunless plowed in very deep the ordinary, strawy manure would ruin the\r\nseed-bed by rendering it too pervious to the dry air, thus preventing\r\ngermination. Much of this valuable material has therefore been, and to\r\nsome extent is still being burnt, thus causing a severe depletion of\r\nthe land, both of humus and of mineral plant-food. The best way to deal\r\nwith stable manure in the arid regions is to thoroughly rot or cure it\r\nbefore putting it on the land, and then plowing it in. To do this of\r\ncourse it must be put in piles and wetted regularly; a procedure which\r\nat the high prices of labor is thought to be too expensive, but which\r\nin the end would be found eminently profitable, unless green-manuring\r\nis regularly done. The very small proportion of humus generally present\r\nin arid soils renders this precaution indispensable, if production and\r\nproper tilth is to be maintained. The saving of stable manure and of\r\nall composting material, even if less needful as a means of supplying\r\nplant-food in the rich soils of the arid regions, is fully as essential\r\nin order to maintain the humus supply.\r\n\r\n\r\n(B.) MINERALS UNESSENTIAL OR INJURIOUS TO SOILS.\r\n\r\nThe minerals heretofore mentioned contribute to soil formation either\r\none or several ingredients, important to plant growth either by\r\ntheir mechanical or chemical action. It remains to consider some not\r\nintrinsically desirable, but frequently present in certain soils,\r\nwhich should be known to the farmer in order that he may be enabled to\r\ncounteract or remove their injurious effects. Leaving aside such as are\r\nof only casual or rare occurrence, the following may be mentioned as\r\namong those which not unfrequently affect soils desirable for culture\r\nto such extent as to make them unavailable for general farming purposes:\r\n\r\n_Iron Pyrite_; sulphid of iron containing two molecules of sulphur\r\nto one of iron; a mineral exceedingly common in deposits of metallic\r\nores, and whose deceptive gold-like color has caused it to be mistaken\r\nfor gold so often as to cause it to be designated as “fool’s gold”\r\namong miners. While it frequently does contain some gold and is often\r\nassociated with valuable ores, it is practically valueless when\r\noccurring outside of mineral veins, in rock-masses; and more especially\r\nin sedimentary rocks, such as sandstones, limestones, shales and clays.\r\n\r\nWhen present in soils it sometimes becomes a source of trouble to the\r\nfarmer, because in contact with air it is soon transformed into ferrous\r\nsulfate or copperas, which, like the carbonate referred to above, is\r\ninjurious to plants. Sometimes indeed iron pyrite is actually _formed_\r\nin badly-drained soils alongside of the carbonate of iron, when much\r\nsulfate (such as gypsum) is present; and then its injurious effects\r\nsubside more slowly than do those of the carbonate (see above, p. 46).\r\n\r\n    _Recognition of Iron pyrite._—The mineral is easily\r\n    recognized by its golden or brass-yellow tint; the latter\r\n    color being the one most commonly shown in the “sulphur\r\n    balls” occurring in marls or soft limestones. A very easy\r\n    test is to pulverize it and then heat it on a shovel over\r\n    a fire, when it will soon itself take fire, burning with a\r\n    blue sulphur flame, and upon more complete roasting, leaving\r\n    behind a red powder, viz., “Venetian red” or red ochre;\r\n    that is, ferric oxid. In clays it commonly occurs in large,\r\n    well-defined cubes, which do not readily form copperas but\r\n    rather become covered with a crust of limonite or brown iron\r\n    ore.\r\n\r\nWhen a subsoil is found to contain pyrite, or when “sulfur balls”\r\nhave been accidentally introduced with dressings of marl, the remedy\r\nis thorough and persistent aeration of the material. In the case of\r\nmarls nothing more need be done; but in that of ill-drained subsoils\r\nit is best to add lime in moderate dressings, to accelerate the\r\ntransformation into ferric hydrate or iron rust, and gypsum; whereby\r\nthe copperas becomes not only innocuous but adds two beneficial\r\ningredients to the soil. The same policy will render available manure\r\nor other materials which have been disinfected by means of solution of\r\ncopperas.\r\n\r\n_Halite_ (rock-salt), or common salt, has already been mentioned as\r\nto its occurrence in connection with the Stassfurt potash salts (see\r\nabove, page 71); but as rock-salt it rarely exerts any injurious\r\ninfluence upon lands. It is, however, a common ingredient of seashore\r\nlands, and is also present to a certain extent in the alkali lands\r\nof the arid countries. While it is true that occasionally small\r\nquantities of common salt are used as an ingredient in fertilization,\r\nits usefulness in that direction is exceedingly subordinate; and it\r\nis far more generally to be considered as an injurious ingredient of\r\nall cultivatable soils whenever present to a larger extent than a few\r\nhundredths of one per cent It is usually considered that one-fourth\r\nof one per cent of common salt renders lands unfit for most culture\r\nplants. Only a few, such as asparagus, the beet, the saltbushes and\r\nsome others, succeed when it is present in this or in larger amounts.\r\nIn the case of sea water it is usually accompanied by a still more\r\ninjurious ingredient, magnesic chlorid or bittern; which is detrimental\r\nto plant growth in much smaller quantities than the common salt itself.\r\n\r\n    _Recognition of Common Salt._—The presence of common\r\n    salt may, as a rule, be detected by the taste, well-known\r\n    to every one; when this taste is very intense or somewhat\r\n    bitterish, it indicates the presence of bittern. The\r\n    presence of salt, however, is easily verified without the\r\n    use of chemical reagents, by slowly evaporating some of\r\n    the clear water leached from the soil in a clean silver\r\n    spoon. If the last few drops are allowed to evaporate\r\n    spontaneously, it will be easy to distinguish, even with\r\n    the unaided eye, the square, cubical crystals, sometimes\r\n    combined into cross-shape, which are characteristic of\r\n    common salt. It is always an unwelcome addition to the land,\r\n    and as its action cannot be neutralized in any way, it can\r\n    be gotten rid of only by leaching-out. This process is\r\n    usually accomplished in seashore lands by the action of\r\n    rain, or by the overflow of fresh-water streams, after the\r\n    tide has been excluded by means of drains provided with\r\n    check-valves to prevent the inflow of tidewater; or else by\r\n    underdrainage, and flooding when possible.\r\n\r\n_Mirabilite_, (Glauber’s salt) or sulfate of soda, exists not\r\nunfrequently in the soils of the arid region and sometimes encrusts\r\nextended areas of lowlands during the dry season. When present in the\r\nsoil it will commonly be seen blooming out on the surface after a rain,\r\nin light, feathery, needle-shaped crystals, sometimes to such an extent\r\nthat it can be collected by the handful. Subsequently, when wafted\r\nby the wind, it is reduced to a fine white dust, which constitutes a\r\ngoodly proportion and sometimes the entire mass of the “alkali dust”\r\nthat is so annoying on the plains of Nevada, and in the desert regions\r\ngenerally, during the hot summer. Near White Plains, Nevada, it forms\r\na thick layer of “_white sand_,” in which the foot sinks deeply, and\r\nwhich is carried about by the wind with great ease.\r\n\r\nGlauber’s salt is never a desirable soil-ingredient. It is largely\r\nproduced as a by-product in several industries, but cannot be utilized\r\nfor agricultural purposes to any extent. It is, however, much less\r\ninjurious to plant growth than common salt; according to experience\r\nin California it may be considered about three times less so. It\r\nconstitutes the major portion of what is commonly known as “white\r\nalkali,” which is well known to be much less injurious to crops than\r\nthe “black” kind, which contains carbonate of soda.\r\n\r\n_Trona and Urao_ are natural forms of carbonate of soda or salsoda.\r\nLike Glauber’s salt, it commonly occurs as a surface efflorescence or\r\ncrust in dry or desert regions; either from the evaporation of standing\r\nwater, as in the case of the soda lakes of Nevada, Hungary and Egypt,\r\nor as an efflorescence on the surface of the soil, as in the western\r\nUnited States, Mexico (“urao”), North Africa (“trona”), and at many\r\npoints in the Old Continent. In the United States it is commonly known\r\nas “black alkali,” because of the black spots formed on the surface by\r\nevaporation; practically the same name (“kara”) is given it in Arabia\r\nand Asia Minor, whence impure soda has long been imported into Europe;\r\nwhile in north India it forms part of the “reh” salts that incrust\r\nlarge areas (usar lands) in the Indo-Gangetic plain.\r\n\r\n                                                                 The\r\n    natural mineral always contains an excess of carbonic acid over\r\n    the “normal” salt, nearly in the proportion of four parts of\r\n    carbonic dioxid to three of soda; it is sometimes designated as\r\n    sesqui-carbonate. In hot sunshine it may lose most of this excess\r\n    for a time; while within the soil itself it may, in presence of\r\n    abundant carbonic acid, become temporarily converted wholly into\r\n    hydrocarbonate or “bicarbonate,” which is less corrosive than the\r\n    monocarbonate or common salsoda.\r\n\r\n_Injury caused in soils._—Like common and Glauber’s salt, carbonate\r\nof soda is always an unwelcome soil ingredient; more so, in fact,\r\nthan either of the other two, since less than a tenth of one per\r\ncent is sufficient to render certain soils wholly untillable, by the\r\ndeflocculation or puddling of the clay; at the same time rendering it\r\nimpervious to water. It is by far the most injurious ingredient that\r\nordinarily occurs in otherwise good, arable soils; for in addition to\r\nthe physical effect just mentioned, it dissolves the humus-substance\r\nof the soil, forming an inky-black solution which, especially when\r\nevaporating on the surface and forming black spots, has given rise to\r\nthe popular name of “black alkali.” As will be more fully explained\r\nhereafter, wherever such is the case, the first step necessary toward\r\nreclamation is the transformation of the carbonate of soda, at least in\r\npart, into the relatively innocuous sulfate, by means of gypsum in the\r\npresence of water; while carbonate of lime remains in the soil.\r\n\r\nIn its direct action on the plants themselves, soda is also most\r\ninjurious; as when accumulated to any extent near the surface by\r\nevaporation it will corrode the root-crown or stem, and sometimes\r\ncompletely girdle the same, destroying the bark. Farther details on\r\nthis subject are given in chapter 22.\r\n\r\n_Epsomite_, or Epsom salt, or sulfate of magnesia, is another one\r\nof the water-soluble minerals frequently found efflorescent on the\r\nsurface of the ground; more commonly in saline seashore lands than\r\nin the alkali region proper, although it is rather common in the\r\nnortheastern portion of the arid region of the United States. Whether\r\non the soil surface or in the crevices of rocks, its needle-shaped,\r\nfeathery crystals greatly resemble those of Glauber’s salt, but are\r\nreadily distinguished by the more intensely bitter taste. Epsom salt\r\nis frequently the last remnant of sea-salts left in the soil after\r\nreclamation. Though probably somewhat more injurious to plant growth\r\nthan Glauber’s salt, the mineral Kieserite, one of the Stassfurt\r\nsalts and consisting essentially of Epsom salt, is sometimes used as\r\nan application to calcareous lands instead of gypsum, and with good\r\nresults. Yet gypsum is usually the safer, and equally effective.\r\n\r\n_Borax_ (bi-borate of soda) occurs much more rarely than the salts just\r\ndescribed; most frequently in certain portions of California, forming\r\npart of the “alkali” in the soil. It is injurious to plant growth, but\r\nis as readily dealt with as is the carbonate of soda, by dressings of\r\ngypsum, whereby inert borate of lime is produced.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to say that saline waters containing any of\r\nthe above salts in notable amounts must be used for irrigation very\r\ncautiously. The measures to be observed in this respect will be\r\ndiscussed later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART SECOND.\r\n\r\nPHYSICS OF SOILS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL COMPOSITION OF THE SOILS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs has already been stated (chapt. 1, p. 10), the general physical\r\nconstituents of soils are _rock powder or sand_ and _silt_, more or\r\nless decomposed according to the nature of the original rocks; _clay_,\r\nthe product of the decomposition of feldspars and some other silicates;\r\n_humus_, the complex product of the decomposition of vegetable and\r\nanimal matters on and in the soil mass; as well as vegetable matter\r\nnot yet humified. Each of these several constituents must now be\r\nconsidered more in detail. Since clay is the substance whose functions\r\nand quantitative proportions influence most strikingly the agricultural\r\nqualities of land, it should be first discussed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Clay as a Soil Ingredient._\r\n\r\nThe plasticity and adhesiveness of clay, together with the extreme\r\nfineness of its ultimate particles (said to reach the 1-25000 of an\r\ninch), explains its great importance as a physical soil ingredient.\r\nIt serves to hold together and impart stability to the flocculent\r\naggregates of soil particles that compose a well-tilled soil; for\r\nwithout clay the sand would collapse into close-packed single grains\r\nso soon as dried, and loose tilth would be impossible. Sand drifts\r\nillustrate this condition.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the fineness of the particles serves to render clay\r\nvery retentive of moisture as well as of gases and of solids dissolved\r\nin water, imparting these important properties to soils containing it;\r\nwhile coarse sandy soils are oftentimes so deficient in them as to\r\nrender them unadapted to any useful culture, despite the presence of an\r\nadequate supply of plant-food.\r\n\r\nWhen to these essential physical properties of clay, there is added\r\nthe fact that usually the clay-substance as it exists in soils\r\ncontains the most finely pulverized and most highly decomposed\r\nportions of the other soil-minerals, and therefore the main part of\r\nthe available mineral plant-food, it is easy to understand why soils\r\ncontaining a good supply of clay should be called and considered\r\n“strong” land by the farmers of all countries. “Poor” clay soils are\r\nexceptional; but sometimes the clay content reaches such a figure that\r\nthe difficulties of tillage render them too uncertain of production for\r\nprofitable occupation.\r\n\r\n_Amount of Colloidal Clay in Soils._—Any and all of the kinds of clay\r\nmentioned (p. 57) as occurring naturally may, of course, enter into and\r\nform part of soils. But as the amount of true, plastic clay substance\r\ncontained in them is very indefinite, it becomes necessary, in order\r\nto classify soils in respect to their tillableness, to ascertain more\r\ndefinitely the amount of pure, or nearly pure, colloidal clay substance\r\ncontained in the several classes of soils ordinarily recognized and\r\nmentioned in farming practice. That this determination can at best be\r\nonly approximate, is obvious from the fact mentioned above (chapt. 4,\r\np. 59), that pure kaolinite itself is not plastic, and only becomes\r\nso by the indefinite comminution and hydration it experiences in the\r\nprocesses of soil-formation. As the progress of this process is also\r\nindefinite, the same soil containing particles ranging from the finest\r\nto the chalky scales of pure kaolinite, the drawing of a line must be\r\nmore or less arbitrary and empirical.\r\n\r\n    From numerous experiments and comparisons made, the writer\r\n    has been led to place the limits of “plastic clay” at and\r\n    below such grain sizes as will remain suspended (afloat) in\r\n    a water column eight inches high, during 24 hours. To go\r\n    beyond this point in the examination of soils for practical\r\n    purposes, would render such examinations so laborious and\r\n    hence so rare, that this kind of work would be practically\r\n    excluded from ordinary practice. According to this view\r\n    the following percentages of such “clay” correspond\r\n    approximately to the designations placed opposite:\r\n\r\n        Very sandy soils           .5 to  3% clay\r\n        Ordinary sandy lands      3.0 to 10%  “\r\n        Sandy loams              10.0 to 15%  “\r\n        Clay loams               15.0 to 25%  “\r\n        Clay soils               25.0 to 35%  “\r\n        Heavy clay soils         35.0 to 45% and over.\r\n\r\n    It must be distinctly understood, however, that these\r\n    figures make no claim to accuracy or invariability. For,\r\n    the tilling qualities of a soil containing one and the\r\n    same amount of such “clay” may be very materially modified\r\n    according to the kind and amount of each of the several\r\n    grain-sizes of rock powder or sand they contain.\r\n\r\n_Influence of fine powders on plasticity and adhesiveness._—An\r\nadmixture of a large amount of fine powders diminishes materially the\r\nadhesiveness of a clay soil, even though it may render it even more\r\n“heavy” in tillage; while the admixture of coarse sand, even in very\r\nconsiderable proportions, does not greatly influence the adhesiveness\r\nof the clay. The latter alone cannot therefore serve as a proper guide\r\nor basis for the classification of soils in respect to tillage; we\r\nmust also take into consideration the nature and amount of the several\r\ngranular sediments mixed with it.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the nature and especially the adhesiveness of the clay\r\nsubstance as obtained by analysis may vary considerably in the presence\r\nof a very large amount of the finest grain-sizes; among which ferric\r\nhydrate or iron rust is especially apt to accumulate predominantly\r\nin the clay, considerably increasing its apparent weight and greatly\r\ndiminishing its adhesiveness.[24] In strongly ferruginous soils,\r\ntherefore, it becomes necessary to take into special consideration the\r\namount of the ferric hydrate or rust which accumulates in the clay\r\nsubstance. The presence of large amounts of humus or vegetable mold\r\nalso influences materially the adhesiveness and physical properties\r\nof the clay obtained by the method described, although most of it\r\nremains with the finer powdery sediments or grain-sizes. There are,\r\nbesides, other colloidal or at least amorphous substances present in\r\nall soils, such as silicic, aluminic and zeolitic hydrates, which are\r\nall non-plastic, and yet sufficiently fine to form part of the “clay”\r\nobtained as above specified.\r\n\r\n[24] This fact emphasizes the impossibility of explaining the\r\nplasticity and adhesiveness of clay simply as a function of fineness of\r\ngrain.\r\n\r\nDespite these imperfections, (which however can in a measure be\r\ntaken into consideration in judging of a soil’s tilling qualities by\r\nits clay content), the figures given in the above table approximate\r\nmuch more nearly to a tangible basis for such estimate, than the\r\nutterly indefinite mixtures which under the older methods of analysis\r\nhave been, and still are to some extent, used as a basis for soil\r\nclassification by writers on agriculture.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rock Powder; Sand, Silt and Dust._\r\n\r\nThe powdery (sandy and silty) constituents of soils usually constitute\r\nthe greater part of their mass; and the proportions present of the\r\nseveral grades of fineness exert a most decisive influence upon their\r\ncultural qualities, and very commonly upon their agricultural value\r\nalso. It is needless to add that the kind of mineral of which they\r\nconsist or from which they were formed, is also of great importance in\r\ndetermining the quality of soils from the standpoint of the chemist,\r\nwith respect to their content of mineral plant-food.\r\n\r\n\r\nWEATHERING IN HUMID AND ARID REGIONS.\r\n\r\n_Sands of the Humid Regions._—As has already been stated, “sand” is\r\nusually understood to be, in the main, quartz more or less finely\r\npulverized, generally intermingled with a few grains of other minerals.\r\nWith this understanding, since quartz is practically inert with respect\r\nto plant nutrition, it follows that soils consisting mainly of this\r\nsubstance contain but little plant-food; hence the common expression\r\n“poor, sandy land,” the outcome of the experience had in Europe and\r\nin the Eastern United States, and which until recently has been held\r\nto be of general application. The “sands of the desert” have, both in\r\nordinary life and in poetry, always stood as the symbol of sterility.\r\n\r\n    Thus the sandy lands (“sand hammocks”) of Florida, the\r\n    (long-leaf) pine lands of the Gulf States, the “pine\r\n    barrens” of New Jersey and of Michigan, are noted both\r\n    for their sandy soils and their sterility after brief\r\n    cultivation; necessitating fertilization within a few\r\n    years from the time of occupation. In Europe, the “Heide”\r\n    (heather) soils of northeastern Germany are of the same\r\n    cultural character.\r\n\r\n_Sands of the Arid Regions._—The experience of arid countries however,\r\nhas long ago shown that some very sandy lands—_e. g._, such as form\r\nthe oases of the north African deserts—may be extremely productive\r\nwhen irrigated, and also of considerable durability. Actual experience\r\nand close investigation given this subject in the arid regions of the\r\nUnited States has fully demonstrated that lands appearing to the\r\ncasual observer to be hopelessly sterile sandy deserts, very commonly\r\nprove to be even more productive than the more clayey lands of the same\r\nregions. Examination of the sand shows, in these cases, that instead\r\nof mere grains of quartz, the minerals of the parent rock, partially\r\ndecomposed, themselves constitute a large proportion of the sandy mass.\r\nBut in the regions of deficient rainfall, as has already been stated,\r\n(p. 47) the formation of clay (kaolinization) is exceedingly slow;\r\nhence the decomposition of the rock powder results in the production\r\nof predominantly pulverulent instead of clayey soils. But the mineral\r\nplant-food is not on that account less available, provided other\r\nphysical conditions necessary for the success of plant growth are\r\nfulfilled. Among these moisture stands foremost; hence the relative\r\nproportions of the several grain-sizes are of vital importance, since\r\nupon this depends to a great extent the proper supply and distribution\r\nof moisture, without which no amount of plant-food will avail.\r\nMoreover, the finest and most highly decomposed powder is the portion\r\nfrom which the roots draw their chief food-supplies.\r\n\r\n    The point last mentioned is well shown in the results\r\n    obtained by Dr. R. H. Loughridge, from the analysis of each\r\n    of the several grain-sizes into which he had resolved a very\r\n    generalized soil of the State of Mississippi, representing a\r\n    very large land area in that State as well as in Tennessee\r\n    and Louisiana. The details of this investigation are given\r\n    farther on; but summarily it may be stated that he found\r\n    practically the whole of the acid-soluble mineral plant-food\r\n    accumulated within the portion of the soil the fineness of\r\n    whose grains was below .025 millimeters (one-thousandth of\r\n    an inch); ingredients so fine as to be wholly impalpable\r\n    between the fingers. Moreover, two-thirds of the total\r\n    amount was found in the portion described above as “clay.”\r\n    It is thus readily understood why clay soils are in the\r\n    regions of summer rains commonly designated as “strong”\r\n    lands.\r\n\r\n    The corresponding later investigations of Rudzinski (Ann.\r\n    Agr. Inst. Moscow, Vol. 9, No. 2, pp. 172-234; Exp. Sta.\r\n    Record, Dec. 1904, p. 245) and of Mazurenko (Jour. Exp.\r\n    Landw. 1904, pp. 73-75; Exp’t Stn. Record, Dec. 1904, p.\r\n    344) fully corroborate Loughridge’s conclusions, for typical\r\n    soils of European Russia.\r\n\r\nIn the arid or irrigation regions, however, the case is different, for\r\nthe reason that much of the decomposed rock-substance remains adherent\r\nto the surface of the larger grains, and plastic clay is formed to a\r\nmuch less extent. Much available plant-food may therefore, in arid\r\nlands, be present even in rather coarsely sandy soils almost devoid\r\nof clay; such as in humid climates would be likely to be found wholly\r\nbarren. (See chapt. 19).\r\n\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL ANALYSIS OF SOILS.\r\n\r\n_Use of Sieves._—Down to a certain point the separation of the soil\r\ninto its several grain-sizes may be accomplished by means of sieves.\r\nWe may thus separate coarse gravel from fine gravel and from sand;\r\nand the latter may itself be separated into several sizes by the same\r\nmeans. This presupposes, of course, that the soil has been previously\r\nprepared for the purpose by crushing the lumps consisting of aggregates\r\nof finer particles, that in the operation of tillage would again be\r\nresolved into their fine constituents, or be penetrated by roots. But\r\nthis preparation of the soil for sifting must not be carried beyond\r\nthe point mentioned, for a grain consisting of particles somewhat\r\nfirmly cemented together will under ordinary conditions play in the\r\nsoil precisely the same part as a solid sand-grain, and must not\r\ntherefore be broken up, if the soil is to be examined in its natural\r\ncondition. The pressure of the fingers or of a rubber pestle is as\r\nfar as trituration should go. The disintegration of these compound\r\nparticles by means of acids, as prescribed and practiced by the French\r\nsoil chemists, may wholly change the physical nature of the soil by\r\nthe breaking-up of mechanical aggregations which in the usual course\r\nof tillage would remain intact. This is especially true of strongly\r\ncalcareous soils, and particularly those containing calcareous sand.\r\n\r\n    The sieves used for this purpose should not be ordinary wire\r\n    sieves, but should have bottoms of sheet brass perforated\r\n    by _round_ holes of the various diameters desired, of\r\n    fractions of inches, or preferably of millimeters. For the\r\n    finer grain sizes, silk bolting cloth is used by the U. S.\r\n    Bureau of Soils.\r\n\r\n    In the sifting process it will be found that so soon as the\r\n    finer grain-sizes of the sand are approached, the sieve\r\n    fails to act satisfactorily; the more so, the more clay was\r\n    originally contained in the material. The fine particles\r\n    flock together, forming little pellets, which refuse to be\r\n    separated by the sieve. This difficulty can, of course, be\r\n    partly overcome by previously separating the clay from the\r\n    sand by means of water, as detailed above; but even then\r\n    it will be found that so soon as the grain-sizes fall much\r\n    below ¹/₅₀ of an inch (½ millimeter) the same difficulty is\r\n    experienced, so long as the sand is dry. By playing a small\r\n    stream of water upon the sieve, however, all the particles\r\n    beyond the ¹/₅₀₀ of an inch may be successfully separated\r\n    from the coarser portion; and for many practical purposes\r\n    the separation need be carried no farther.\r\n\r\n    _Use of Water for Separating Finest Grain-Sizes._—The\r\n    scientific investigator, however, must of necessity proceed\r\n    to separate the finer grain-sizes from each other, since,\r\n    as will presently be shown, they influence the tilling\r\n    qualities of the soil to a much greater degree than do\r\n    the coarser particles. Such farther separation can be\r\n    accomplished only by the aid of water.\r\n\r\n_Subsidence Method._—When a small amount of soil is stirred up in\r\nwater, and is afterward allowed to stand for some time, the different\r\ngrain-sizes will settle consecutively in accordance with their\r\nsizes (or weights); the smallest ones settling latest, and the clay\r\nonly remaining suspended, as stated above. So long, however, as any\r\nconsiderable amount remains suspended in the water, the latter is not\r\nonly denser but especially more viscid than if the clay were absent.\r\nIn order therefore to obtain correct results by any method involving\r\nthe use of water, it is necessary to remove the clay before proceeding\r\nto the separation of the granular sediments. This, as has been already\r\nstated, is approximately accomplished by allowing the soil, when\r\ndiffused in water after proper disintegration, to settle for 24 hours\r\nfrom a column of water 200 mm. high, whereby all grain-sizes, of\r\nand above .01 mm. diameter are removed from the turbid liquid. This\r\nsedimentation is then repeated until after 24 hours the water becomes\r\nclear. The clay is then determined in the “clay water” by evaporation\r\nor precipitation; the granular sediments may then be successfully\r\nseparated by sedimentation.\r\n\r\nThe U. S. Bureau of Soils uses for the separation of clay, instead of\r\nsubsidence for 24 hours, the more expeditious process of centrifuging\r\nthe turbid soil water in appropriate glass cylinders, by the aid of\r\nan electric motor; and thus in a relatively short time obtains “clay”\r\nin which the upper limit of size is one-half of that mentioned above,\r\nviz., .005 mm. But for the costliness of the appliances required,\r\nincluding the entire time of an operator, this method of separating the\r\nclay would undoubtedly be preferable to the elimination by subsidence;\r\nthe more as a more minute grain-size for the clay group is thus secured.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.—Schöne’s Elutriator.]\r\n\r\nThe separation of the clay having been accomplished, the various sizes\r\nof silt and sand may be separated by again suspending them in water;\r\nand interrupting the settling process at stated times, the grain-sizes\r\ncorresponding to definite velocities in settling may be segregated and\r\nweighed. When this process of settling and decanting is carefully and\r\nrepeatedly carried out, very good results are obtained.\r\n\r\n_Hydraulic Elutriation._—The sedimentation (or “beaker”) method,\r\nlong practiced in the arts is, however, quite tedious, requiring the\r\nconstant close attention of a skilled observer. The desired results\r\nmay, in the writer’s judgment, be more conveniently obtained by the\r\nhydraulic method, whenever no very large volume of work of this kind is\r\nrequired to be done at once.\r\n\r\nWhen instead of allowing the soil to settle in quiet water, the latter\r\nis used as an ascending current of regularly graded velocities, it\r\nis clear that the soil particles will be carried off by this current\r\nin exact conformity with their several sizes (or strictly speaking,\r\nvolume-weights); and when maintained in such a current for a sufficient\r\nlength of time, the entire quantity of the sediment corresponding to\r\nthe prevailing velocity will be carried away. It is of course easy\r\nto ascertain to what grain-sizes certain velocities of the upward\r\ncurrent (regulated by a stopcock with arm moving on a graduated scale)\r\ncorrespond, and to regulate accordingly the intervals between the\r\ndifferent velocities to greater or less detail, as may be desired. A\r\nnumber of instruments have been devised for this purpose.\r\n\r\n_Schöne’s Elutriator_ is the one commonly used in Europe; in it the\r\nupward current ascends in a conical glass tube, (see figure 6) entering\r\nthrough a narrow, curved inlet tube, in which the soil sample is kept\r\nagitated by the current itself. The objection to this plan is twofold:\r\nfirst, the narrow, curved inlet-tube is readily clogged by the soil\r\nmass at the lower velocities, which are thereby changed, so that,\r\nunless a very small amount of soil only is employed, the whole mass is\r\nnot kept properly stirred; second, the circulating currents brought\r\nabout by the conical shape of the tube cause the sediment-particles to\r\ncoalesce into complex, larger ones (floccules), which will then settle\r\ndown and fail to pass over at the current-velocity corresponding to\r\ntheir individual component parts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.—The Churn Elutriator (Hilgard’s) for the\r\nphysical analysis of soils.]\r\n\r\n_Churn Elutriator with Cylindrical Tube._—The errors just alluded\r\nto are obviated by an arrangement devised by the writer, in which\r\na rapidly revolving stirrer, placed at the base of a cylindrical\r\ntube in which the washing process is conducted and which eliminates\r\ncounter-currents, continually disintegrates these compound particles,\r\nand thus enables the entire quantity of the sediment corresponding to\r\nthe prevailing current-velocity to pass off with a comparatively slight\r\nexpenditure of time on the part of the operator (see figure 7). A wire\r\nscreen interposed between the churn and cylindrical glass tube prevents\r\ncommunication of the whirling motion to the column. As the apparatus\r\nworks automatically, the analyst has only to observe from time to time\r\nwhether or not the turbidity near the top of the tube has disappeared;\r\nand as the sediment accumulates at the bottom of the tall receiver\r\nbottle,[25] no harm is done if the attendant should neglect to change\r\nthe velocity in time, except that water will run to waste.\r\n\r\n[25] The figure given of this elutriator in Bulletin No. 24, on\r\nphysical soil analysis, published by the U. S. Bureau of Soils, shows\r\nas the receiver a bottle entirely too low to insure the complete\r\nretention of the sediments by settling. The receiving bottle should not\r\nbe less than twelve inches high and five inches wide.\r\n\r\nThe conical relay glass below the churn serves to retain the coarser\r\ngrades of sediments which are not concerned in the velocities employed\r\nin the elutriator tube, and thus prevents injurious attrition. But\r\nthese sediments can at any time be stirred up by the incoming current\r\nand brought into the washing tube if desired. In the same manner the\r\npassing-off of the finer sediments can be materially accelerated by\r\nrunning off rapidly about two-thirds of the turbid column of water\r\nevery twenty minutes.\r\n\r\nIt should be fully understood that prior to attempting such separation,\r\nthe “colloidal clay” must first be removed by the subsidence or\r\ncentrifugal method, since otherwise much larger grain-sizes may be\r\ncarried off at a given velocity.\r\n\r\n_Yoder’s Centrifugal Elutriator._—A very ingenious instrument which\r\ncombines the elutriation and sedimentation processes into one, has\r\nbeen devised by P. A. Yoder, of the Utah Expt. Station. The elutriator\r\nbottle is placed in a centrifuge driven by an electric motor; it is\r\nclosed by a glass stopper carrying a delivery tube to a short distance\r\nabove the bottom of the elutriator bottle, as well as an outflow tube\r\nending at the base of the stopper; the latter also carries a funnel\r\ncoinciding with the center of rotation. Into this funnel flows\r\ngradually the muddy water containing the soil in suspension; and the\r\nrate of its flow, together with the velocity of rotation, determines\r\nthe size of the sediment-granules that will be deposited in the\r\nslack-water below the mouth of the delivery tube. The muddy soil-water\r\nis kept agitated in a funnel-shaped reservoir by air-bubbles from a\r\nconstant-pressure chamber.\r\n\r\nWhile the principle of this instrument is good, it is quite complicated\r\nand the results obtainable from it in practice have not as yet been\r\nmade public. The inventor claims that an analysis may by its means be\r\ncompleted in less than three hours.\r\n\r\nIn all hydraulic elutriators a provision for constant pressure in\r\nthe reservoir supplying the current of water is needed; although in\r\nSchöne’s and some other instruments a gradually decreasing pressure in\r\na plain reservoir is employed. A large glass bottle or carboy fitted\r\nwith the proper tubes so as to constitute a Mariotte’s bottle (in which\r\nthe air enters near the bottom of the vessel), is a very convenient\r\narrangement.\r\n\r\n_Number of Sediments._—The number of grain-sizes or sediments into\r\nwhich the soil mass is to be segregated is of course entirely within\r\nthe option of the operator. Experience has shown that it is unnecessary\r\nto discriminate very closely between the several sizes of the coarser\r\nportion of the sand, such as those lying between one-fourth and\r\none-half of a millimeter. But below this point, and especially between\r\none-tenth of a millimeter and the clay, a proper discrimination becomes\r\nvery important. The series first devised by the writer in 1872 is based\r\nupon a consecutive doubling of the velocities of the current from\r\na quarter of a millimeter per second to thirty-two millimeters per\r\nsecond; the sediment of sixty-four millimeter-velocity corresponding to\r\na diameter of one-half of a millimeter, will remain in the elutriator.\r\nAbove this, as before remarked, the sieve (especially when aided by a\r\njet of water) effects a satisfactory segregation.\r\n\r\nThe table below shows the elements of these series both as regards\r\ncurrent-velocities and maximum quartz-grain diameters carried off by\r\neach. In a great many cases, however, it is altogether unnecessary to\r\ngo into such detail, and a subdivision into six or seven divisions\r\nis quite sufficient. Such a subdivision, based upon the doubling of\r\ngrain-sizes instead of current-velocities, has been adopted by Prof.\r\nMilton Whitney, of the U. S. Department of Agriculture, and others.\r\n\r\n    TABLE OF DIAMETERS AND HYDRAULIC VALUES OF SEDIMENTS.\r\n\r\n    ===============================================================\r\n                             |Velocity per second,|Maximum diameter\r\n    Designation of materials.|    or hydraulic    |   of quartz\r\n                             |       value.       |    grains.\r\n    -------------------------+--------------------+----------------\r\n                             |       _Mm._        |     _Mm._\r\n                             |                    |\r\n    Grit                     |       (?)          |     1-3\r\n                           { |       (?)          |    .5-1\r\n                           { |     32-64          |        .50\r\n    Sand                   { |     16-32          |        .30\r\n                           { |      8-16          |        .16\r\n                           { |      4- 8          |        .12\r\n                           { |      2- 4          |        .072\r\n                           { |    1.0- 2          |        .047\r\n    Silt                   { |     .5- 1          |        .036\r\n                           { |     .25-0.5        |        .025\r\n                           { |         0.25       |        .016\r\n                           { |       < 0.25       |        .010\r\n                             |                    |\r\n    Clay                     |       < 0.0023     |\r\n    -------------------------+--------------------+----------------\r\n\r\n_Results of such analyses._—A tabular presentation of the results of\r\nanalyses made in accordance with the above plan will give a good idea\r\nof the differences between the various grades of soils recognized\r\nin farm practice, to any one accustomed to the study of figures.\r\nBut a much more satisfactory showing is made by placing the several\r\ngrain-sizes segregated, into small vials or tubes of identical diameter\r\nand placing them in parallel series alongside of each other.[26] The\r\ncurves formed by the surfaces of the several sediment-columns in each\r\nseries show to the eye very strikingly the relations of the several\r\ngrades of soils to each other, and suggest at once that while gentle\r\nslopes or gently undulating curves belong to soils of intermediate,\r\nloamy character, steep grades and zigzags show soils of extreme types.\r\nThis is exemplified in the subjoined Figures:\r\n\r\n[26] Convenient stands for this purpose, used by the writer since 1872,\r\nmay be cut from L-shaped moldings of wood, such as can be readily\r\nordered from any planing mill. The vials can be cemented, wired or\r\ntied.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.—Illustration of Results of Hydraulic\r\nElutriation, showing extremes of soil texture, and intermediate loam.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.—Illustration of Results of Hydraulic\r\nElutriation, showing Alluvial Silts and Pine-Woods Soil.]\r\n\r\n_Physical composition corresponding to popular designations of Soil\r\nquality._—The subjoined table illustrates the physical composition\r\nof a number of soils from the State of Mississippi, selected for\r\ntheir representative character, in order to deduce therefrom\r\napproximate definitions of physical character corresponding to popular\r\ndesignations. This table, published in 1873 in accordance with results\r\nobtained during the two preceding years, does not require any material\r\nmodification on account of subsequent investigations. It lacks,\r\nhowever, a characteristic representative of the predominant soils of\r\nthe arid region, viz., the silty soils so prevalent in dry climates,\r\nonly approximately represented by No. 165 of the table; hence two such,\r\nfrom California, exemplifying respectively the valley deposits of the\r\nSacramento and Colorado rivers, have been added to the list.\r\n\r\nIt must not, however, be understood that these typical soils\r\nnecessarily represent correctly the physical constitution of all\r\nsoils falling under the same popular designation; for we are far from\r\nbeing able as yet to predict accurately in every case the tilling\r\nqualities of a soil material from its physical composition. To do this\r\nit would be necessary not only to know with some degree of precision\r\nthe several physical coefficients of each of the several grain-sizes,\r\nand perhaps of many more intermediate ones; but we would also have to\r\nconstruct a formula according to which each could be given its proper\r\nweight when present in varying proportions, and of varying shapes,\r\nsurface condition, and material. For this our present knowledge is\r\nwholly inadequate, if indeed the problem is not beyond the limits of\r\nmathematical computation. We must for the present at least be satisfied\r\nwith the empirical approximations afforded us by the constantly\r\nincreasing number of such analyses, correlated with farming experience.\r\n\r\n        Since the finest grain-sizes above those classed as “clay”\r\n        do not tend to “lighten” soils, but even to render them more\r\n        intractable (“putty soils”), while coarser ones gradually\r\n        change the dense clay-texture into the “loamy,” it is clear\r\n        that in between there must be a neutral point, some grain\r\n        sizes which by themselves do not influence soil texture\r\n        either way. Discussion of numerous physical analyses, and\r\n        some direct experiments, have led the writer to conclude\r\n        that this theoretically neutral grain-size lies at or\r\n        near the diameter of .025 mm., or .5 mm. hydraulic value.\r\n        In correlating the results of analysis with the tilling\r\n        qualities of the soil as to “heaviness and lightness,”\r\n        therefore, that grain-size may usually be left out of\r\n        consideration.\r\n\r\n                  PHYSICAL ANALYSES OF SOILS AND SUBSOILS.\r\n\r\n        (A) = 238 White Pipe Clay.

If for this purpose we assume all the soil grains\r\nto be spherical, we shall obtain the minimum figures, for most other\r\nshapes will pack more closely. King (Physics of Agriculture, p. 117)\r\ncalculates such figures for different grain-sizes, assuming the density\r\nto be that of quartz (2.65), with the result that while with a diameter\r\nof one millimeter (1-25 inch) the number of grains would be 720, and\r\nwith one-tenth of a mm. 720,000; if made of the finest particles only,\r\nviz., one thousandth of a mm., the number would be 720,000 billions.\r\nProbably few of the clayey soils we ordinarily deal with are of this\r\norder; it is doubtless approached in certain fine plastic clays.\r\n\r\n_Surface afforded by various grain-sizes._—The amount of _surface_\r\nafforded by a similar amount of soil must naturally be considered in\r\nthis connection, since upon it depends not only the amount of moisture\r\nwhich the soil may hold in the form of superficial films, but also the\r\nextent of surface upon which the weathering agencies as well as the\r\nroot hairs of plants may act. Quoting again from King’s work, we find\r\non the same premises given above for the _number_ of grains, that their\r\n_surface_ would in the case of grains of one mm. diameter be eleven\r\nsquare feet per pound (about half a pint) of material; while in the\r\ncase of the finest grade we should have 110,538 square feet, or more\r\nthan two and a half acres.\r\n\r\nFrom actual experiments made with the flow of air through various\r\nsoils, King calculates that while in ordinary loam soils the total\r\nsurface is about an acre per cubic foot, in fine clay soils it rises to\r\nas much as four acres. If we imagine this large surface to be covered\r\nwith even a very thin film of water, it is readily seen how large an\r\namount may be present in a cubic foot of moist soil.\r\n\r\n    E. A. Mitscherlich (Bodenkunds für Land-und-Forstwirthe;\r\n    Berlin, 1905) attributes to the surface offered by the\r\n    soil particles supreme importance in determining the\r\n    productiveness of soils. According to him the internal\r\n    soil-surface determines directly the ease with which roots\r\n    can penetrate the soil; and he proposes the determination\r\n    of this factor by means of the heat produced in wetting\r\n    the soil (“Benetzungswärme”), measured in a calorimeter,\r\n    as a substitute for all methods of physical soil analysis,\r\n    which are vitiated by the varying shapes and densities\r\n    of the particles; while his method gives directly the\r\n    actual surface. To the consumption of energy required\r\n    by difficult penetration he attributes most of the\r\n    differences in production, and hence refers to the internal\r\n    soil-surface as governing nearly all the other physical\r\n    factors. The introduction of many arbitrary assumptions,\r\n    and the failure to show that the admitted inaccuracy of\r\n    the ordinary mechanical soil analyses are of any practical\r\n    importance, greatly detract from the cogency of the rigorous\r\n    mathematical discussion carried through his work by\r\n    Mitscherlich.\r\n\r\n_Influence of the several grain-sizes on soil texture._—Undoubtedly\r\nthe most potent of all the sediments appearing in the above table in\r\ninfluencing soil texture, is the “clay.” That the materials included\r\nunder this empirical designation may vary considerably in different\r\nsoils, has already been sufficiently insisted on; and it is doubtful\r\nthat in the present imperfect state of our knowledge of the functions\r\nof the several physical grain-sizes, we would be much wiser were we to\r\ngo to the extreme advocated by Williams (Forsch. Agr. Phys., vol. 18,\r\np. 225, ff.), of determining with precision the actual amount of such\r\nextremely fine clay particles as cease altogether to obey the law of\r\ngravity when once suspended in water. It is at least doubtful that the\r\nessential property of adhesive plasticity belongs only to these, for\r\nthis property doubtless increases gradually as the size diminishes,\r\nalthough unquestionably not a mere function of the latter, since it\r\nbelongs only to the hydrated silicate of alumina.\r\n\r\n    _Ferric Hydrate._—Probably the body which most\r\n    commonly modifies materially the adhesive and contractile\r\n    properties of the clay substance, is ferric hydrate;\r\n    the more as on account of its high density it tends to\r\n    exaggerate materially, in many cases, the apparent content\r\n    of true clay, and the estimate of the soil’s plasticity\r\n    based upon it. A good example in point is the case of soil\r\n    No. 246 (Miss.) of the above table. This is a heavy clay\r\n    soil, yet not excessively adhesive; scarcely as much so as\r\n    No. 230 (Miss.), the heavy gray “flatwoods” soil, and not\r\n    nearly as “sticky” when wet as No. 173 (Miss.), the prairie\r\n    subsoil, although containing apparently 15% more clay than\r\n    the former, and 7% more than the latter. But No. 246 is a\r\n    highly ferruginous clay, in which the ferric hydrate is in\r\n    a very finely divided condition, and materially influences\r\n    the physical qualities of the clay substance. Were it all\r\n    accumulated in the “clay,” it would diminish the percentage\r\n    of true clay by 11.75%, reducing the clay-percentage to\r\n    28.5% which accords more nearly with the soil’s only\r\n    moderate adhesiveness, and not excessively heavy tillage.\r\n\r\nBut it must be remembered that the iron oxid shown in the analysis is\r\nnot nearly always in this finely diffused condition. Frequently it\r\nincrusts the sand grains; quite commonly it forms small concretions of\r\nlimonite, which themselves act as sand grains; and again, it may be\r\npresent in the form of “black sand” or magnetic oxid, as is commonly\r\nthe case in California and on the Pacific slope generally. To take\r\nthis point properly into account, therefore, it would be necessary to\r\ndetermine the amount of ferric hydrate actually present in the “clay”\r\nas separated by subsidence of the granular constituents.\r\n\r\n_Other substances._—This circumstance as well as the inevitable\r\npresence of other modifying substances, clearly shows the desirability\r\nof being enabled to examine the physical properties of this “clay”\r\ndirectly, by collecting its entire amount as obtained in analysis,\r\ninstead of merely determining it by weighing fractional portions. When\r\nthis is done the analysis is much more valuable as indicating the true\r\ntilling qualities of the land. The increase of bulk suffered by this\r\nsubstance after wetting, is a very fair index of its content of true\r\nclay, and is preferable to the chemical analysis proposed by some\r\ninvestigators. For it is quite impossible to distinguish the silica and\r\nalumina derived from the kaolinitic substance proper, from that which\r\nis due to the decomposition of zeolites.\r\n\r\nIt is possible, however, to determine the possible _maximum_ of the\r\nkaolinite ingredient by taking into consideration the quantitative\r\nratio according to which silica and alumina combine to form it, viz.,\r\napproximately 46% of the former to 40 of the latter, the rest being\r\nwater. By using this calculation we can often demonstrate clearly the\r\npresence in the “clay” of considerable amounts (up to 33%) of _aluminic\r\nhydrate_; since no zeolitic mass can contain as much alumina as does\r\nkaolinite. Whether the aluminic hydrate be in the form of gibbsite,\r\nbauxite, diaspore,[27] or in the gelatinous state, the nature of the\r\nsoils containing it proves that it is totally destitute of plasticity\r\nand adhesiveness; and this consideration will often serve to explain\r\nthe fact that soils showing in their chemical analysis high percentages\r\nof alumina, nevertheless show quite low degrees of plasticity,\r\nadhesiveness and water absorption. What part it may take in modifying\r\nthe physical properties of the soil we can thus far only conjecture.\r\n\r\n[27] Bauxite is not only the most abundant of the three hydrates of\r\nalumina known to occur naturally, but also stands nearly midway between\r\nthe two others in its water content, viz., a little over 25%; that of\r\ndiaspore being nearly 15%, gibbsite about 35%.\r\n\r\n_Influence of the granular sediments upon the tilling qualities of\r\nSoils._—Considering the granular sediments by themselves, in the\r\nabsence of clay, it may be stated in a general way that while in a\r\nmoist condition they flocculate sufficiently to produce a fair tilth,\r\nthey will nevertheless on drying collapse into a close arrangement\r\nresulting from the single-grain structure. The form of the grains\r\nbeing angular instead of rounded, they are apt to form a very closely\r\npacked mass far from suitable to vegetable growth; as will be seen by\r\nan example taken from one of the culture stations of the University of\r\nCalifornia, from a piece of land which on the surface would be called\r\na very sandy loam, but after we descend increases in its content of\r\nfine grains until at a depth varying from eighteen inches to three\r\nfeet we find what appears to be a hardpan, which is equally impervious\r\nto roots and water and causes the water to stagnate to such an extent\r\nthat after heavy rains the land becomes so boggy as to render plowing\r\nalmost impossible without endangering the team. A close examination of\r\nthis hardpan shows that, unlike others, it is devoid of any cement, and\r\nwhen taken out can be readily crushed between the fingers, and softens\r\nin water, but does not become plastic. Its imperviousness is therefore\r\ndue solely to the close packing of the sand grains, for it contains\r\npractically no plastic clay, and under the microscope the grains\r\nare seen to be angular-wedge-shaped and composed of the remnants of\r\ngranite. The physical analysis shows the following result:\r\n\r\n    MECHANICAL ANALYSIS OF HARDPAN.\r\n\r\n    ==================================\r\n    Designation.|Diameter.|Percentage.\r\n    ------------+---------+-----------\r\n              { | .50 mm. |   10.93\r\n    Sand      { | .30  “  |   21.23\r\n              { | .12  “  |    7.27\r\n                |         |\r\n              { | .072 “  |    9.63\r\n              { | .047 “  |   12.00\r\n    Silt      { | .036 “  |    7.19\r\n              { | .025 “  |    1.25\r\n              { | .016 “  |   14.20\r\n                |         |\r\n    “Clay”      |    ?    |    8.64\r\n    ------------+---------+-----------\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful whether this condition of things can be remedied by the\r\nusual measure of breaking up the hardpan either by hand or by means\r\nof giant-powder blasting. Experience seems to show that the effect\r\nis only temporary, and that in the course of time, by the action of\r\nthe percolating waters, the particles settle back into their original\r\nimpervious condition. It is just possible, however, that if once\r\npenetrated by roots, the intervention of these would permanently\r\ndestroy the close structure, so as to make this a fair subsoil for the\r\ngrowth of trees and other plants. The writer is not aware that this\r\nkind of purely physical hardpan without cement has ever been observed\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nThis physical condition is doubtless responsible for two other\r\nphenomena, viz., the “putty soils,” and also certain difficulties\r\nexperienced in irrigation.\r\n\r\n“_Putty Soils_” is the name popularly given in the Cotton States, and\r\nprobably elsewhere, to soils usually occurring in low ground and also\r\nknown as “cray-fishy.” They consist of very uniform, powdery sediment,\r\nwith little or no coarse sand and still less of clay to render them\r\ncoherent. When wet these soils behave precisely as would glazier’s\r\nputty, adhering to the surface of even the best-polished plowshare, so\r\nthat no furrow-slice can be turned and the plow is soon dragged out\r\nof the ground. At a very closely limited condition of moisture such\r\nlands may plow fairly well; but when this limit is passed in the least\r\n(as sometimes happens in the course of a single day), it turns up only\r\nhard clods, which in a few hours of sunshine become so hard that no\r\ninstrument of tillage short of a sledgehammer will make any impression\r\nupon them. The physical analysis of these usually gray soils shows that\r\nthey contain only a trifling amount of clay; perhaps 1 or 2%, playing\r\nthe part of linseed oil in making putty out of whiting. Even the\r\naddition of lime does not help such soils much, because there is little\r\nor no clay to flocculate. They are, as a matter of fact, among the most\r\nrefractory lands the farmer has to deal with. A soil showing similar\r\nbehavior, though not quite as extreme as in the case of the Gulf or\r\nCotton States’ soils in question, occurs at the culture substation at\r\nPaso Robles, California, and is probably closely correlated to the\r\nphysical hardpan referred to above. The physical analysis of this soil\r\nyielded the following result:\r\n\r\n       MECHANICAL ANALYSIS OF SOIL.\r\n\r\n    ==================================\r\n    Designation.|Diameter.|Percentage.\r\n    ------------+---------+-----------\r\n              { | .50 mm. |   14.24\r\n              { | .30  “  |   15.17\r\n    Sand      { | .16  “  |    8.88\r\n              { | .12  “  |    5.60\r\n                |         |\r\n              { | .072 “  |    6.75\r\n              { | .047 “  |    8.35\r\n    Silt      { | .036 “  |    8.55\r\n              { | .025 “  |    6.03\r\n              { | .016 “  |   17.77\r\n                |         |\r\n    “Clay”      |    ?    |    7.50\r\n    ------------+---------+-----------\r\n\r\nIt would seem the best and almost only remedy to be applied to\r\nsuch soils as these is the introduction of vegetable matter or\r\ngreen-manuring, by which their texture is loosened: for the hauling of\r\nmere clay upon the land would hardly accomplish the purpose intended,\r\nwithin the limits of farm economy.\r\n\r\n_Dust Soils_, which during the dry season are even in their natural\r\ncondition so loose as to rise in clouds and render travel very\r\nuncomfortable, are not uncommon in arid countries, _e. g._, in\r\nWashington and adjacent parts of Oregon, on the uplands bordering the\r\nColumbia, Yakima and Snake rivers.

Irrigation furrows must be placed\r\nvery close together and in large numbers, in order to ensure the\r\nwetting of the soil so that the crop shall not suffer from lack of\r\nmoisture at a distance of two or not more than three feet. Where the\r\nirrigation furrows are drawn farther apart a fine stand of grain may\r\nbe seen within eighteen inches of the same, while farther away the\r\ncrops may be dying from lack of moisture. This difficulty is by no\r\nmeans infrequent in the arid region, and is difficult to overcome\r\nexcept by frequent and thorough tillage, which gradually increases the\r\nrapidity of water-penetration; as has been shown in the soils of the\r\nalluvial prairies of the Yakima country in the State of Washington.\r\nIt is necessary, however, to take care that they shall always contain\r\nan adequate amount of humus or vegetable matter, in order to prevent\r\nre-consolidation by the burning-out of the humus during the warm,\r\nrainless season.\r\n\r\nThere is an unmistakable resemblance between these dust soils of the\r\nNorthwest and the “putty” soils mentioned above; both showing a very\r\nlow percentage of clay with a relatively large amount of the finest\r\nsediments, with a sudden downward break of the curve before the coarser\r\ngrain-sizes are reached. It would seem as though the absence of these\r\nintermediate grains favors the close packing of the fine sediments\r\nin the interstices of the coarse ones, thus bringing about the\r\nimperviousness, which is the chief obstacle to their cultivation.\r\n\r\n_Effects of coarse Sand._—Coarse sand intermingled with heavy clay\r\nsoils has but little effect in improving the tilling qualities, unless\r\ncarried to such excess as renders it financiallyimpracticable. In\r\nactual practice it is frequently possible to improve such soils by\r\nproperly distributing upon them the washings of the adjacent hills,\r\nwhich will always carry sands of many grades; and when it is intended\r\nto improve garden land by hauling sand it is important to choose the\r\nlatter so as to complement the deficient grain-sizes of the soil.\r\nThe sand of wind drifts or dunes is generally well adapted to such\r\nimprovement, being, as Udden[28] has shown, of a fairly definite\r\ncomposition of sufficiently wide range of grain-sizes for the purpose.\r\n\r\nThe effects of humus in modifying soil texture are discussed farther on.\r\n\r\n[28] The Mechanical Composition of Wind Deposits, Bull. No. 1,\r\nAugustana Library Publications; 1898.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE DENSITY AND VOLUME-WEIGHT OF SOILS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAside from the humus-substances the specific gravity of the common\r\nsoil constituents, taken individually, do not vary widely; kaolinite\r\nbeing the lightest (2.60), feldspar next (2.62); then quartz (2.65),\r\ncalcite (2.72). Mica and hornblende range (according to their iron\r\ncontents) from 2.72 to over 3.0. The average specific gravity of soils\r\nof ordinary humus content only will thus range between 2.55 and 2.75;\r\nsandy soils approaching very closely to that of quartz alone.\r\n\r\n_Volume-Weight._—The specific gravity of the soil is, however, of\r\nlittle practical consequence compared with the “_volume-weight_,” _i.\r\ne._, the weight of the natural soil as compared with an equal bulk of\r\nwater. A cubic foot of water weighs 62½ pounds; a similar volume of\r\nsoil usually weighs more, but in the case of peaty lands may actually\r\n(when dry) weigh less. The extreme range is from 110 pounds for\r\ncalcareous, and somewhat less for siliceous sand, to as little as 30 to\r\n50 pounds in the case of peaty and swamp soils. It may be conveniently\r\nremembered that while average arable loams range from 80 to about 95\r\npounds per cubic foot, “heavy” clay soils range from 75 pounds down\r\nto 69, observed by the writer in the case of certain alluvial soils,\r\npoor in humus,[29] of the Sacramento river, California. Manured garden\r\nsoils, and the mold surface soil of deciduous forests, generally\r\ncontain so much humus as to depress their weight considerably, varying\r\naccording to their state of tilth from 66 to 70 pounds per cubic foot.\r\n\r\n[29] This remarkable soil seems to have been derived from the finest\r\n“slickens” of the hydraulic gold mines.\r\n\r\n_Weight per acre-foot._—As for practical purposes and calculations it\r\nis often desirable to know approximately the weight in pounds of an\r\nacre (43,560 square feet) one foot deep, it is convenient to remember\r\nthat in the case of sandy land, this weight (per “acre-foot”) may be\r\nassumed at four millions of pounds; for loams, at 3½ millions; for\r\nclay lands, 3¼ millions; for humus or garden land and woods earth,\r\nabout 3 millions of pounds; for reedy swamp and peaty lands, 2 to 2½\r\nmillions.\r\n\r\n    The loose tilth and humus-content of the surface soil will\r\n    in general cause it to weigh less, bulk for bulk, than the\r\n    underlying subsoil, even when the latter is more clayey;\r\n    moreover, the continuous pressure from above will tend to\r\n    consolidate the subsoil and substrata. Warington (Phys.\r\n    Properties of Soils, pp. 46, 47) gives interesting data on\r\n    this point from the Rothamstead fields, as follows:\r\n\r\n    Old pasture, first nine inches   71.3 pounds per cub. ft.\r\n    Same,        fourth  “    “     102.3   “     “   “    “\r\n    Arable land, first   “    “      89.4   “     “   “    “\r\n    Same,        fourth  “    “     101.4   “     “   “    “\r\n\r\n    The influence of humus and unhumified organic matter, as\r\n    well as of tillage, in diminishing the volume-weight of\r\n    soils is here strikingly shown.\r\n\r\n_Air-space in Natural Soils._—The difference between the specific\r\ngravity as usually determined, and the volume-weight of soils, is of\r\ncourse caused by the large amount of air contained in them when dry,\r\nbut which in wetting them is partially or wholly replaced by water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.—Various possible arrangements of soil\r\nparticles.]\r\n\r\nTheoretically, assuming all soil grains to be globular, and packed as\r\nclosely as possible (in oblique order), the space not filled by them\r\nwould be the same for all sizes, whether that of marbles, or so minute\r\nas to be hardly felt between the fingers; and would be 25.95 per cent\r\nof the soil volume.[30] If the same globular particles were packed\r\nas loosely as possible, _i. e._, in square instead of oblique order\r\n(see figures 10 and 11), the vacant space would be 47.64 per cent If\r\nhowever we imagine each sphere to be itself composed of a number of\r\nsmaller ones, the empty space will obviously be greatly increased, to\r\nan extent proportionate to the diminution of solid mass thus brought\r\nabout. The pore-space might in that case, with the oblique arrangement\r\nof the globules as shown in Fig. 10, be as high as 74.05 per cent But\r\nsince the soil particles may be of all shapes and sizes within the same\r\nsoil, and usually fit much more closely than would globular grains,\r\nthe empty space rarely approaches (only in certain alluvial soils and\r\nin loose mulches) to the figure last named. In sandy soils it may fall\r\nas low as 20%, and in coarse gravelly soils even as low as 10%. Most\r\ncultivated soils range between 35 and 50% of empty space.\r\n\r\n[30] King, Physics of Agriculture, p. 116, ff.\r\n\r\n_Effects of Tillage._—That these figures can be only approximations is\r\nobvious from the consideration that one and the same soil will vary\r\nmaterially in its volume-weight according to its temporary condition\r\nof greater or less compactness. After land has been beaten by winter\r\nrains, its volume-weight will be found to have materially increased\r\nfrom the well-tilled condition brought about by thorough cultivation.\r\nThis difference is strikingly seen when, in plowing, the height of\r\nthe ground on the land side is compared with that of the turned\r\nfurrow-slice in well conditioned loamy land. This loose condition is\r\ncalled _tilth_, and it results from the formation of relatively large,\r\ncomplex crumbs[31] or floccules, between which there are large air\r\nspaces that were wholly absent in the untilled land; the floccules\r\nthemselves being also more loosely aggregated than was the case before\r\ntillage.\r\n\r\n[31] The word crumbs, which is generally understood as meaning a\r\nrelatively large, loose aggregate, seems preferable to the word\r\nkernels, suggested for the same by King (Physics of the Soil, p.\r\n110). Kernels are understood to be bodies rather more solid than the\r\nsurrounding mass, and do not convey the idea of loose aggregates. The\r\nword “Krümelstructur” (crumb-structure), adopted by Wollny for this\r\nphenomenon, has both fitness and priority in its favor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.—Land before and after plowing. The compactness\r\nof the soil is indicated by the density of dotting. Before plowing\r\nthere is a compact surface crust (s), below which the soil becomes less\r\nand less compact as we go deeper. After plowing we find the soil (fs,\r\nfurrow-slice) converted into a loose mass of crumbs (floccules), with\r\nincrease of bulk. Compacted plowsole at pl.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.—A soil-crumb, magnified to show the particles\r\nof which it is composed. The particles are held together by the\r\nwater-menisci, just as are the hairs of a brush when wetted. The white\r\nspaces between the particles represent air.]\r\n\r\n_Crumb or Flocculated structure._—Figure 11 illustrates the difference\r\nbetween the unplowed land, consolidated especially on the surface by\r\nwinter rains, and in its upper portion consisting largely of single\r\ngrains; while the plowed land, toward which the furrow-slices have\r\nbeen turned, is greatly increased in height and volume and consists\r\nalmost wholly of variously-shaped and-sized aggregates or floccules,\r\nloosely piled upon one another and separated by large interspaces. The\r\nincrease in volume from consolidated clay to crumb-structure is given\r\nby Wollny (Forsch., vol. 20, p. 13, 1897) at 41.9%, to powder as 33%.\r\nOn moistening dry clay increased 36.9%, quartz powder 8.01%. When land\r\nis plowed in the proper moisture-condition the crumbs of floccules are\r\nheld together by the surface tension of the capillary films (menisci)\r\nof water at the points of contact. In the case of sands, the crumbs\r\nwill collapse into single grains whenever the water-films evaporate,\r\nunless some cementing substance was dissolved or suspended in the\r\nwater. (See figure 12). Lime carbonate is one of the substances most\r\ncommonly found permanently cementing the floccules; hence the ready\r\ntillage of most calcareous soils, and especially the loose texture of\r\nthe “loess” of the western United States, and of Europe and Asia. In\r\nthese deposits we find sandy and silt aggregates or concretions ranging\r\nfrom ten or more inches in length (loess puppets) to microscopic size,\r\nheld together by lime carbonate, but collapsing into silt and sand when\r\nthe material is treated with acid so as to dissolve the cement. The\r\nrough surfaces of these aggregates, gripping into each other, explain\r\nthe stability of the steep loess cliffs in the United States, as well\r\nas in northeastern China, as observed by Von Richthofen and Pumpelly.\r\n\r\n_Clay_ is most frequently the substance which imparts at least\r\ntemporary stability to the crumbs and crumb-structure; this is one of\r\nits most important functions in soils, as it serves to _maintain_ tilth\r\nonce imparted by cultivation, even after the land dries out. Beating\r\nrains, and cultivation while too wet, will in this case of course\r\ndestroy the crumbs and the loose tilth.\r\n\r\nOther substances which greatly aid the maintenance of tilth are the\r\nseveral humates (of lime, magnesia, iron), which when fresh are\r\ncolloidal (jelly-like) like clay itself, but unlike the latter, when\r\nonce dried do not resume their plastic form by wetting (Schloesing).\r\nThe crumbs thus formed are therefore quite permanent and contribute to\r\nthe looseness of soils rich in humus. One part of lime humate is said\r\nby Schloesing to be equal in cementing power to eleven parts of clay.\r\n\r\nSilica, silicates and ferric hydrate are sometimes found cementing soil\r\ncrumbs, wholly or in part.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the ready penetration of air, water and roots thus\r\nrendered possible is obvious; and the question arises how it happens\r\nthat wild plants are able to do without tillage.\r\n\r\n_How Nature Tills._—When we examine the undisturbed soil of woods or\r\nprairie in the humid region, we will as a rule find the natural surface\r\nsoil in a very good condition of tilth; the obvious cause being the\r\npresence in it of an abundant network of surface roots and rootlets of\r\ngrasses and herbs, which in connection with the fallen foliage prevent\r\nthe beating and compacting of the soil surface; which can be seen to\r\nhappen before the observer’s eyes whenever a heavy rain falls on a bare\r\nland surface, however well tilled.\r\n\r\n_Crusting of Soils._—In some soils, especially of the Gulf States, the\r\nbeating of rain followed by warm sunshine so effectually compacts the\r\nsurface that in the case of taprooted plants like cotton, it becomes\r\nnecessary to cultivate after each rain, so as to break the crust that\r\nwould otherwise not only prevent the proper circulation of air, but\r\nwould also serve to waste the moisture of the land. The same land in\r\nthe wild condition suffered no such change, being protected by the\r\nnative vegetation, and by fallen leaves. (See chapt. 8).\r\n\r\n_Soils of the arid region._—In the regions of deficient rainfall the\r\nconditions are modified in several respects. Grass sward rarely exists,\r\nnearly all grasses assuming the habit of growing in tufts or bunches\r\nsome distance (a foot or two) apart; hence the name of “bunch grass”\r\ncommonly used, which however means not any one definite kind of grass,\r\nbut serves to distinguish the grasses of the uplands from those of the\r\nmoist lowlands, where true sward may be found. Between these bunches\r\nof grass the soil is fully exposed, and being free from roots and\r\nleaf-covering is compacted, _unless its nature is such that the usually\r\ngentle rains do not produce a serious crusting of the surface_.\r\n\r\nThat such is actually the predominant nature of the soils formed under\r\narid influences has already been stated; and thus the hard-baked\r\nsoil-surface so often seen in the Eastern United States in unplowed\r\nbare land, or during the prevalence of a drought, is rarely seen in\r\nthe arid region. The clay lands that do exist are usually sufficiently\r\ncalcareous to possess the property of “slaking” into crumbs whenever\r\nwetted after drying. But where this is not the case, the stony hardness\r\nbrought about by the long dry and warm season is long in being removed\r\nby the winter rains.\r\n\r\n_Changes of soil-volume on wetting and drying._—The behavior of\r\ncolloidal clay in the above respects has already been described above\r\n(see chapt. 4, page 59). It is obvious that whenever soils contain a\r\nlarge proportion of such clay, their behavior on wetting and drying\r\nwill approximate to those of the pure clay. This is exemplified in the\r\nheavy clay, or so-called “prairie soils” of the United States, which\r\nwhen thoroughly wetted in spring will, during a dry summer, form wide,\r\ngaping cracks. These in the long summers of the arid region may extend\r\nto the depth of several feet, with a width of as much as three and\r\nmore inches at the surface of the ground. This, of course, contributes\r\ngreatly to the drying-out of the soil to the same depth, and results\r\nas well in the mechanical tearing of the root-system of growing\r\nplants; sometimes causing the total destruction of vegetation. In some\r\nclay soils it happens that after a rain or irrigation, the shrinkage\r\noccurring upon the advent of warm sunshine will cause the surface crust\r\nto so contract around the stem, _e. g._, of grain, as to constrict and\r\n_injure the bark_, causing serious injury to the crop. In soils of\r\nthis character very _thorough tillage in preparing for a crop_, and\r\nthe maintenance of _a loose surface during its growth, are of course\r\nextremely essential_.\r\n\r\nIn the arid region it will frequently happen that such soils when not\r\ntilled to a sufficient depth, will during the later part of the summer\r\nso shrink and crack beneath the shallow-tilled surface layer that the\r\nlatter will bodily fall into the cracks, exposing the roots to all the\r\ndeleterious influences of mechanical lesion and drying-out. It is thus\r\nobvious that the cultivation of such soils should not be undertaken at\r\nall by those not naturally able and willing to bestow upon them, to\r\nthe fullest extent, the deep and thorough tillage which is absolutely\r\nessential in the utilization of their usually high productive power.\r\n\r\n    _Extent of Shrinkage._—The extent of this shrinkage\r\n    in drying, and subsequent expansion in wetting, have been\r\n    measured by the writer by the use of the sieve cylinder\r\n    described below (chapt. 11, p. 209), as serving for the\r\n    determination of the water capacity of soils. When a soil of\r\n    the kind above referred to is placed in the sieve cylinder\r\n    in the tilled (flocculated) condition, then allowed to\r\n    absorb its maximum of water and then dried at 100 degrees\r\n    C., the contraction in drying can be very strikingly seen,\r\n    and its amount measured by filling up the empty space with\r\n    mercury; then measuring the latter after expelling the\r\n    surplus by means of a ground glass plate laid on top. The\r\n    contraction of several heavy clay soils, thus measured,\r\n    has been found by the writer to range from 28 to as much\r\n    as 40 per cent of the original bulk.[32] The soil thus\r\n    contracted, when again wetted, does not return altogether to\r\n    its original bulk, but remains in a more or less compacted\r\n    condition, like that of a soil which has been rained upon.\r\n\r\n[32] Wollny (Forsch. Vol. 20, p. 13 ff., 1897) records similarly high\r\nshrinkages in his experiments.\r\n\r\nThe expansion and contraction of a heavy clay soil on wetting and\r\ndrying are well illustrated in the figure below, in which the soils are\r\nshown in the shallow cylinder which serves for the determination of\r\nwater-holding power (see chapt. 11, p. 209). The middle figure shows\r\nin profile the expansion of a dry, pulverized “black adobe,” struck\r\nlevel, when allowed to absorb its maximum of water; it rises above\r\nthe rim of the sieve-box to nearly the half height of the latter. The\r\noutside figure to the right shows the same soil after drying; that to\r\nthe left, a red clay soil similarly treated. It is easily seen that\r\nthese variations in volume may bring about very marked results in the\r\nfields; the surface of which, apart from the cracks usually formed,\r\nmay be several inches lower in the dry season than during wet weather.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RED CLAY SOIL. BLACK “ADOBE” CLAY SOIL.\r\n\r\nFIG. 13.—Expansion on Wetting and Contraction on Drying of heavy clay\r\nsoils.]\r\n\r\n_Contraction on Wetting._—In the case of alkali soils containing much\r\ncarbonate of soda, a very notable _contraction_ occurs in _wetting_\r\nthe loose, dry soil. The cause is here obviously the collapse of the\r\ncrumbs, formed in dry tillage or crushing, into single grains, closely\r\npacked. The same result is observed in the naturally depressed “alkali\r\nspots” (see chapt. 22).\r\n\r\n“_Hog-wallows._”—In the _field_ the wetting of cracked clay soils\r\nproduces some very curious effects. The effect of the first light rains\r\nusually is to crumble off the edges or angles near the surface, the\r\nmaterials thus loosened falling into the lower portion of the cracks.\r\nThis is repeated at each successive shower followed by sunshine,\r\nthe crevices thus becoming partly filled with surface soil. When,\r\nsubsequently, the heavier and more continuous rains wet the land fully,\r\nalso causing the consolidated mass in the crevices to expand, the\r\nlatter cannot close on account of the surplus material having fallen\r\ninto them; the result being that the intermediate portions of the\r\nsoil are compelled to bulge upward, sometimes for six or more inches,\r\ncreating a very uneven, humpy surface, well-known in the southwestern\r\nUnited States as “hog-wallows.”[33]\r\n\r\n[33] A totally different kind of “hog-wallows,” occurring in California\r\nand the arid region generally, have been described in a previous\r\nchapter under the head of Aeolian soils (See chapt. 1, p. 9).\r\n\r\nSuch a surface is always therefore an indication of an _extremely heavy\r\nsoil, difficult to cultivate_; yet embracing some of the most highly\r\nand permanently productive lands known in the United States, and in\r\nIndia, where the “regur” lands of the Deccan are of this character;\r\nthey have been cultivated without fertilization for thousands of years.\r\nThe subjoined physical analyses of lands of such extreme character as\r\nto be almost uncultivatable will serve to exemplify their physical\r\ncomposition.\r\n\r\n                 PHYSICAL ANALYSES OF HEAVIEST CLAY SOILS.\r\n\r\n    ===================================================================\r\n                                             |No 242 Miss.|No. 643 Cal.\r\n                                             +------------+------------\r\n                                             |Hog-wallows |Black Adobe.\r\n                                             |   soil.    |Contra Costa\r\n                                             | Jasper Co. |    Co.\r\n                                             |Mississippi.|California.\r\n    -----------------------------------------+------------+------------\r\n    Weight of gravel over 1.2 mm. diameter } |      .83   |\r\n      “         “    between 1.2 and 1 mm  } |            |\r\n      “         “    between 1 and 0.6 mm    |     1.19   |\r\n    Fine earth                               |    97.98   |   100.00\r\n                                             +------------+------------\r\n                                             |   100.00   |   100.00\r\n              FINE EARTH.                    |            |\r\n                                             |            |\r\n          Hydr.

This is a common experience in the black\r\nprairie lands of Texas.\r\n\r\n_Calcareous Clay Soils crumble on drying._—The heavy clay soils of some\r\nof the calcareous prairies of the Southwest, instead of contracting\r\ninto a stony mass on drying, on the contrary resolve into a mass of\r\ncrumbs, thus producing excellent tilth. This occurs even though the\r\nland may have been plowed when wet, and of course is a great advantage.\r\nThe most striking exemplification of this peculiarity occurs in the\r\nheavy but profusely fertile “buckshot” clay lands of the Yazoo bottom,\r\nin Mississippi, where it is usual to plant corn and sweet potatoes in\r\nthe semi-fluid mud left after an overflow, after turning a shallow\r\nfurrow, then covering by turning another. To the onlooker it seems\r\nimpossible that such plantings could be successful; but within a short\r\ntime the muddy surface becomes a bed of crumbs (“buckshot”), forming a\r\nseed-bed not readily excelled by any made by artificial means. Hence,\r\nlargely, the almost invariable success of crops in the Yazoo region.\r\n\r\n_Port Hudson Bluff._—The same clay produces a most unpleasant result\r\nat the foot of the Port Hudson bluff, where it crops out some feet\r\nabove low water. When after a freshet the water level falls below this\r\nstratum, on drying the clay disintegrates into crumbs just as does the\r\nYazoo buckshot soil; with the result that at the next rise, the loose\r\nmass subsides into the river as a flood of mud. Thus the foot of the\r\nbluff is being constantly undermined, and the falling of the bluff\r\nscarp has obliged the town above to recede many hundreds of feet from\r\nits original historic site.\r\n\r\nThe exact proportions of lime carbonate necessary to produce this\r\nphenomenon, and its necessary relations to clay substance and other\r\nphysical soil ingredients, yet remain to be investigated.[35]\r\n\r\n[35] Schübler (Grundsätzed. Agrikulturchemie, 1838) ascribes the\r\ncrumbling of calcareous clay soils to the difference in the contraction\r\nof calcareous sand and the clay substance. But it is doubtless more\r\ndirectly connected with the flocculation of the latter by lime.\r\n\r\n_Loamy and Sandy Soils._—It is largely the _absence_ of these extreme\r\nchanges of volume that renders the cultivation of loamy or even sandy\r\nlands so much more easy, and the success of crops so much more safe,\r\nthan is the case in clay soils. Whenever the content of colloidal clay\r\ndiminishes below 15%, the shrinkage in drying from the wet condition\r\nbecomes so slight as to cause no inconvenience; while in sandy soils\r\nproperly speaking, no perceptible change in volume occurs.\r\n\r\nPeaty soils, however, and all those containing a relatively large\r\namount of humus, are also liable to visible shrinkage when passing from\r\nthe wet to the dry condition. But on account of their looseness and\r\nporosity such shrinkage does not usually result in the formation of\r\ncracks or rupture of the roots, as is the case in heavy clay lands. The\r\nentire mass of the soil then shrinks downwards, but rarely forms cracks\r\non the surface. Hence the introduction of humus into “heavy” soils is\r\namong the best means of improving their tilling qualities.\r\n\r\n_Formation of Surface Crusts._—Some soils, especially those of a\r\nclay-loam character, are very liable to the formation of hard surface\r\ncrusts from the beating of rains, and from surface irrigation; owing,\r\ndoubtless, to the ready deflocculation of their clay substance. It is\r\nnot easy to define the precise physical composition conducive to this\r\ncrust formation; but the subjoined physical analyses show examples\r\nof soils in which this tendency is very prominent and is frequently\r\nannoying, in that when they occur in the regions of frequent summer\r\nrains, it becomes necessary after each one to till the surface in hoed\r\ncrops (_e. g._, in cotton-fields) in order to prevent the injurious\r\neffects of such consolidation of the surface. It may, of course, be\r\nprevented by mulching, or on the large scale by green-manuring, to such\r\nextent as to prevent contraction.\r\n\r\n    The subjoined physical analyses of two soils from the\r\n    Brown-Loam region of Northern Mississippi (see chap. 24),\r\n    shows the composition of lands excellent in every respect\r\n    other than the tendency to crust after each rain:\r\n\r\n            PHYSICAL ANALYSES OF CRUST-FORMING SOILS.\r\n\r\n    ===========================================================\r\n                      |Diameter.|Hydr.

A higher proportion of\r\n    clay, even though associated with a similarly high or even\r\n    larger proportion of these fine sediments, seems to prevent\r\n    crusting, probably because the swelling of the clayey\r\n    ingredient on wetting and its extravagant contraction in\r\n    drying breaks up the continuity of the surface. The heaviest\r\n    clay soils, such as those shown on a preceding page, neither\r\n    crust nor crumble on drying after wetting, but contract into\r\n    lumps of stony hardness, _as a whole_.\r\n\r\nThe burning-out of the humus from well-tilled surface soils during the\r\nextended heat and dryness of rainless summers, brings about such a\r\ncontraction or packing of the surface soil of orchards in California\r\nas to greatly reduce their productiveness, and to render necessary\r\ndiligent green-manuring as the only practical remedy. In many cases,\r\nliming of the surface also serves well to prevent this injurious\r\neffect, which to some extent of course follows surface irrigation as\r\nwell as rains.\r\n\r\nIn most soils, repeated alternate wetting and drying _in place_\r\nproduces a loose, flocculated texture, so long as no deflocculation is\r\nbrought about by mechanical causes, such as beating rains or running\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n_Effects of Frost on the Soil._—The expansion suffered by water in\r\nfreezing necessarily tends to separate the soil particles previously\r\nheld together by the surface tension of the capillary water, or\r\notherwise flocculated or cemented. Freezing of the soil is therefore of\r\nmaterial assistance in _disintegrating_ cloddy, ill-conditioned soils,\r\nleaving them in loose, crumbly condition after the ice has melted and\r\nthe surplus water drained off; so as to materially facilitate tillage\r\nand root penetration. When, however, soils thus circumstanced are\r\ntilled or trodden while too wet, they quickly become puddled, being\r\npractically reduced to single-grain structure. (See this chapt. p.\r\n110). Hence the injury caused by allowing cattle to range in winter on\r\ncultivated land subject to freezing and thawing, which it sometimes\r\ntakes years to correct.\r\n\r\nA disagreeable effect often produced by the freezing and thawing of\r\nwet lands is the “heaving-cut” of grain, resulting from the upward\r\nexpansion of the surface soil in freezing, that may readily rupture the\r\nroots; while on thawing, the soil surrounding the upheaved stool is apt\r\nto settle down, especially in case of a rain, leaving the stool and\r\nroots exposed either to drying or freezing, as the case may be. Hence\r\nthe desire of grain farmers in northern climates, for a sufficient\r\ncovering of snow to protect the fall-sown grain, rather than an “open\r\nwinter,” during which the grain is exposed to alternate freezes and\r\nthaws, or extreme cold.\r\n\r\nIn certain soils, notably in those liable to crusting (p. 117), instead\r\nof heaving the soil, the water in freezing emerges bodily from small\r\ncracks, in foliated or wire-like forms (“ice-flowers”) resembling those\r\nof native silver, and formed substantially in the same way, by a kind\r\nof “wire-drawing” process, aided by crystallization.\r\n\r\n    Small ice-crystals formed on the surface of small crevices\r\n    filled with water cause others to be formed at their lower\r\n    ends, and the expansion occurring in freezing, forces the\r\n    ice upward; the process repeating itself under favorable\r\n    conditions, until the stalks or sheets of ribbed ice grow to\r\n    a height of several inches. This phenomenon is especially\r\n    frequent in the middle cotton States—Arkansas, Tennessee,\r\n    northern Mississippi, etc., where frequent changes from\r\n    rainstorms or thaws to cold northwest winds occur in winter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nSOIL AND SUBSOIL.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAUSES AND PROCESS OF DIFFERENTIATION. HUMUS.\r\n\r\n_Soil and Subsoil Ill-defined._—While the general mass of rock\r\ndebris formed by the action of the agencies heretofore discussed as\r\nsoil-material, may under proper conditions become soil capable of\r\nsupporting useful plant growth, universal experience has long ago\r\nrecognized and established the distinction between soil and subsoil:\r\nby which are ordinarily meant, respectively, the portion of the\r\nsoil-material usually subjected to tillage, and what lies beneath.\r\nThere can be no question about the practical importance of this\r\ndistinction; but the definition of the two terms, as commonly given in\r\nsome works of agriculture, is both incomplete and, in its application\r\nto many cases, partly misleading.\r\n\r\nThe differentiation of soil and subsoil is due partly to the action of\r\norganic matter and micro-organisms, partly to physico-chemical causes,\r\nnow to be discussed in detail.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ORGANIC AND ORGANIZED CONSTITUENTS OF SOILS.\r\n\r\n_Humus in the Surface soil._—The most obvious mark of distinction\r\nbetween soil and subsoil is, usually, the darker tint of the former,\r\ndue to the presence of humus or vegetable mold, which becomes most\r\napparent by darkening of the tint when the soil is moistened. Thus\r\nsoils having a gray tint when dry, may become almost black when wetted.\r\nWhen no such deepening of color occurs in wetting, the absence or great\r\ndeficiency of humus may safely be inferred. The only other substance\r\nwhose presence may invalidate the conclusions based upon the darkening\r\nof the soil tint, is ferric hydrate (iron rust), which itself possesses\r\nthe property of darkening on wetting, and may effectually cover either\r\nthe presence or the absence of humus.\r\n\r\nSince the formation of the humus depends upon the decomposition of\r\norganic matter (mostly of the cellulose group) derived partly from\r\nthe roots, partly from the leaves and stems of plants growing and\r\ndying on the soil, its accumulation near the surface is natural. But\r\nsince the depth to which roots penetrate varies greatly not only with\r\ndifferent plants, but very essentially in conformity with the greater\r\nor less penetrability of the soil and subsoil, the depth to which the\r\ndark humus tint may reach vertically varies correspondingly, from two\r\nor three inches to several feet. In the case of soils that have been\r\nformed by the gradual filling-up of swamps or marshes, the humus-tint\r\nmay reach to several yards depth.\r\n\r\n_Surface Soil, and Subsoil._—It is thus apparent that the term “surface\r\nsoil,” while commonly confined by the farmer to the portion turned by\r\nthe plow or usually reached in cultivation by any implements, may or\r\nmay not belong, functionally, to layers of greatly varying thickness.\r\nSimilarly the term _subsoil_ may or may not refer, in individual\r\ncases, to parts of the soil mass materially different from the surface\r\nsoil. Yet this distinction is of no mean practical importance, because\r\nthe efficacy of one of the most common measures of soil improvement,\r\nviz., subsoil plowing or “_subsoiling_,” depends materially upon the\r\ndifferences between soil and subsoil in each particular case. Most of\r\nthe diversity of opinion regarding the merits of this operation is\r\nsimply the result of a corresponding diversity in the natural facts and\r\ncultural practice of each case.\r\n\r\n_Causes of the Differentiation of Soil and Subsoil._—One of the\r\nprominent points of difference between surface soils and subsoils has\r\nalready been mentioned in the usual predominance of root-mass in the\r\nupper layers; to which is added a part at least of the substance of\r\nfallen leaves and stems of its vegetation. How much of this vegetable\r\nmass ultimately becomes converted into humus, as well as the nature of\r\nthe product formed, depends upon a great variety of circumstances; some\r\nof which have already been mentioned in connection with the general\r\ndiscussion of humification (chapt. 2, p. 20). Briefly stated, the main\r\ncontrolling conditions are: the amount of water or moisture present,\r\nthe access of air (oxygen), a proper temperature, and the presence of\r\nthe several organisms which in the course of time take part in the\r\nprocess of soil-formation.\r\n\r\n_Ulmin Substances; Sour Humus_ (Germ. Rohhumus).—In the presence of\r\nso much moisture or liquid water as will materially impede the access\r\nof air, and with the concurrence of reasonably low temperatures, the\r\norganisms that at first take the chief role in the transformation of\r\nthe vegetable tissues into humus-like substances are bacteria. But the\r\nantiseptic nature of the compounds thus formed[36] soon puts an end\r\nto their activity, and thereafter the process seems to be a purely\r\nchemical one, and very slow. In peat bogs, the transition from the\r\nfresh, dead stems and roots to brown peat is easily followed downward,\r\nwhite cellulose fibers remaining apparently unchanged to some depth;\r\nso that such fiber has been used for tissues and paper. The solid\r\ndecomposition-products are brown substances, partly soluble in water\r\nand imparting to it a brown or coffee color (frequently seen in the\r\ndrains of marshes) and an acid reaction; the latter due to ulmic (as\r\nwell as apocrenic) acid, readily soluble in caustic and carbonated\r\nalkalies, and forming insoluble salts with the earths and metals; while\r\nanother portion, ulmin, is insoluble in the same, but gradually becomes\r\nsoluble by oxidation.\r\n\r\n[36] The antiseptic properties of sour humus are well exemplified in\r\nthe perfect state of preservation in which the remains of animals,\r\nwood implements, etc., are found in bogs into which they have sunk in\r\nprehistoric times.\r\n\r\nThe gaseous products formed under these conditions are carbonic dioxid\r\nand “marsh gas” (methan, CH₄), the former predominating in the early\r\nstages; while later, the carburetted hydrogen predominates, rendering\r\nthe gas readily inflammable.\r\n\r\n_Sour Soils._—The “sour” soils thus produced in nature in presence of\r\nexcess of water bear only “sour” growth, such as sedges and rushes, of\r\nlittle agricultural value; they usually require reclamation processes\r\nbefore becoming adapted to ordinary crops. In old forests of northern\r\nclimates a peaty and more or less acid layer is sometimes formed on the\r\nsurface, above the black woods-earth, and retards somewhat the full\r\nproduction of such land when taken into cultivation.[37]\r\n\r\n[37] See Müller, Natürliche Humusformen.\r\n\r\nMarshes and swamps, both fresh and salt, as above stated usually\r\nshow coffee-colored waters, which are also characteristic of the\r\nstreams that drain them, until by intermixture with waters containing\r\nlime salts, the ulmic substances are neutralized and precipitated.\r\nSuch neutralization, preferably by means of lime, is the first step\r\ntowards the reclamation of lands bearing “sour” vegetation. The acid\r\nreaction characterizing the ulmic substances is also characteristic\r\nof many woodlands, notably in the United States of the soils of\r\nthe “Long-leaf-pine” region of the Cotton States, both upland and\r\nlowland, as well as of many deciduous forests in northern climates.\r\nHence liming, whether artificial or natural, effects a most notable\r\nimprovement, together with a marked change of vegetation, in these\r\nlands.\r\n\r\n    It has been long known that after long-continued\r\n    cultivation, soils originally of neutral or slightly basic\r\n    reaction become acid: and the liming of such lands is an\r\n    ancient practice in Europe. The matter, however, received\r\n    but scant attention until Wheeler and Hartwell, of the\r\n    Rhode Island Experiment Station, demonstrated the almost\r\n    universal acid condition of the older lands of that State,\r\n    and the excellent effects produced by neutralization with\r\n    lime, or even with the alkali carbonates.[38] The current\r\n    neutralization of the humus-acids is unquestionably one of\r\n    the cardinal advantages of calcareous lands; for such as\r\n    contain only small amounts of lime carbonate will of course\r\n    become acid more quickly under cultivation.\r\n\r\n[38] Reports of the Rhode Island Exp’t Station, 1895, and ff.\r\n\r\n_Humin Substances._—In the presence of only a moderate amount of\r\nmoisture, therefore under the influence of a more or less rapid\r\ncirculation of air, and in the presence of earthy carbonates\r\n(especially that of lime) to prevent the formation of acids, or to\r\nneutralize them as formed, the normal process of humification occurs;\r\nmainly under the influence of fungous instead of bacterial growths. The\r\nvarious molds take a prominent part in the conversion of the vegetable\r\nsubstance into black, neutral, insoluble humus compounds. Such fungous\r\nvegetation is always accompanied by the evolution of carbonic gas,\r\nand the resulting fungous tissues are markedly richer in nitrogen and\r\ncarbon than the substance of the higher plants from which they were\r\nderived (see chapt. 9). Comparative analyses show that in the normal\r\nprocess of humification of vegetable substances, oxygen and hydrogen\r\nare eliminated in the form of water and carbonic dioxid, while at\r\nthe same time there is an increase in the percentage of carbon, and\r\ngenerally also of nitrogen; the latter more particularly in the case of\r\nvegetable matter not very rich in that element. When once humification\r\nis complete, oxidation, especially under arid conditions, bears mainly\r\nupon the carbon and hydrogen, so that the nitrogen content may rise to\r\nvery high figures; while another portion is ultimately wholly oxidized,\r\nwith the formation of nitrates, under the influence of the nitrifying\r\nbacteria, this being the process chiefly efficient in the nutrition of\r\nvegetation with nitrogen.\r\n\r\n    As a matter of course, the several organic compounds\r\n    contained in plants may continue to exist in soils for\r\n    some time, varying according to conditions of temperature\r\n    and moisture. Thus dextrin, glucose, and even lecithin and\r\n    nuclein have been reported to be found. The activity of\r\n    the numerous fungous and bacterial ferments under favoring\r\n    conditions will, of course, limit the continued existence of\r\n    such compounds somewhat narrowly, so that they can hardly be\r\n    considered as active soil ingredients save in so far as they\r\n    favor the development of the bacterial flora.\r\n\r\n_Porosity of Humus._—One of the essential features of natural humus is\r\nits great porosity, whereby it not only becomes highly absorbent of\r\nwater and gases, but is also gradually oxidized, probably under the\r\ninfluence of bacteria. For this oxidation, as measured by the evolution\r\nof carbonic gas, progresses most rapidly under the same conditions\r\nas to moisture, temperature and access of air, that are known to be\r\nmost favorable to fungous and bacterial growth. Hence the formation\r\nof carbonic dioxid in the soil is assumed to be the measure of the\r\nintensity of such activity.\r\n\r\n_Physical and Chemical Nature of the Humus Substances._—The humus\r\nsubstances are gelatinous when moist, but are neither markedly adhesive\r\nor plastic. Like the other colloidal substances of the soil, they serve\r\nto retain both gases and vapors, including moisture, liquid water,\r\nand its dissolved solids. In the natural, porous condition they are\r\npowerfully absorbent of gases, including especially aqueous vapor.\r\nDry humus swells up visibly when wetted, the volume-weight increasing\r\nto the extent of two to eight times; so that humus stands foremost in\r\nthis respect among the soil constituents. The _density_ of natural\r\nhumus is about 1.4, being the lightest of the soil constituents. Hence\r\nsoils rich in humus are “light” not only in the farmer’s sense of being\r\neasily tilled when not too wet, but also of light weight for equal\r\nvolumes when compared with clayey and sandy soils.

When, however, natural humus is _boiled_\r\n    with these substances, ammonia is slowly given off, but the\r\n    process continues indefinitely and it seems to be impossible\r\n    to expel all the nitrogen in this manner. This behavior\r\n    being characteristic of amido-compounds, it is presumable,\r\n    in view of the slightly acid nature of the humus substances,\r\n    that natural humus is largely of an amidic constitution.\r\n    Artificial humic acid, formed by the action of caustic\r\n    alkalies upon sugar, gums or cellulose, combines with\r\n    ammonia as with other bases, and at first the ammonia\r\n    can be readily expelled from this as from other ammonia\r\n    salts. But after the lapse of some time it seems that the\r\n    amidic condition is assumed, so that caustic lye acts but\r\n    very slowly and cannot expel the whole of the nitrogen\r\n    present. This is very important in connection with the\r\n    practice of fertilization, as any ammonia taken up by or\r\n    generated in the soil is thus in the course of time rendered\r\n    comparatively inert, and unavailable to vegetation until\r\n    nitrified.\r\n\r\n_Progressive Changes._—The natural neutral humin and ulmin, as found,\r\n_e. g._, in the lower portions of peat beds, are in the course of time\r\nby oxidation converted into ulmic and humic acids, capable of combining\r\nwith bases; by still farther oxidation they form apocrenic and crenic\r\nacids, readily soluble in water and in part forming soluble salts with\r\nlime, magnesia and other bases. These acids act strongly upon the more\r\nreadily decomposable silicates of the soil, and in the course of time\r\nmay dissolve out, and aid in the removal by leaching, of most of the\r\nplant-food ingredients as well as the ferric hydrate of a soil. Thus\r\nred or rust-colored soils may be rendered almost white by continued\r\n“swamping” with stagnant water, and be greatly impoverished; and it is\r\ndoubtless largely through this agency that the underclays of coal beds\r\nand the lower portions of peat beds, as well as peat and coal ashes,\r\nare almost wholly destitute of mineral plant food.\r\n\r\n_The Phases of Humification._—The progressive changes involved in\r\nthe process of humification of vegetable matter are illustrated in\r\nthe table below,[42] together with the farther changes by which such\r\nmatter may ultimately be transformed into the several varieties of\r\ncoal, and finally into anthracite, which already represents nearly pure\r\ncarbon, but in nature has sometimes been still farther transformed into\r\ngraphite (black-lead) and diamond.\r\n\r\n[42] Data recalculated, omitting ash.\r\n\r\n       PROGRESS OF HUMIFICATION, AND FORMATION OF COAL.\r\n        (MOISTURE AND ASH OMITTED FROM CALCULATIONS.)\r\n    ========+==========+======================+============+\r\n            |          |      Oak Wood.       |            |\r\n            |          +------+--------+------+   Humin    |\r\n            |Cellulose.|Fresh.|Decayed.|      |    and     |\r\n            |          |      +--------+------+   Humic    |\r\n            |          |      | Light  | Dark |   Acid.    |\r\n            |          |      | Brown. |Brown.|            |\r\n    --------+----------+------+--------+------+------------|\r\n    Carbon  |  44.44   | 50.60|  53.60 | 56.20|49.4 to 59.7|\r\n    Hydrogen|   6.17   |  6.00|   5.20 |  4.90| 2.5 “   4.5|\r\n    Oxygen  |  49.38   |      |        |      |35.8 “  47.3|\r\n            |          | 43.40|  41.20 | 38.90|            |\r\n    Nitrogen|          |      |        |      |  .3 “  18.7|\r\n    --------+----------+------+--------+------+------------+\r\n\r\n    ========+======================+================================\r\n            |       Peat.[43]      |            Coals.\r\n            |--------+-------------+--------+-----------+-----------\r\n            | Brown  |   Black.    | Lignite|  Scotch   |  Penn’a\r\n            |Surface.+------+------+  Brown |  Splint   |Anthracite.\r\n            |(Ulmin.)|40 in.|80 in.|  Coal. |Bituminous.|\r\n            |        |      |      |(Bovey).|           |\r\n    --------+--------+------+------+--------+-----------+-----------\r\n    Carbon  |  57.80 |62.00 |64.10 |  69.50 |   84.20   |   94.80\r\n    Hydrogen|   5.40 | 5.20 | 5.00 |   5.90 |    5.80   |    2.60\r\n    Oxygen  |  36.00 |30.70 |26.80 |  24.00 |    8.80   | }\r\n            |        |      |      |        |           | }  2.60\r\n    Nitrogen|   .80  | 2.10 | 4.10 |    .60 |    1.20   | }\r\n    +-------+--------+------+------+--------+-----------+-----------\r\n\r\n[43] Detmer, Landw. Versuchst., Vol. 14, 1871.\r\n\r\nThe steady increase of carbon and nitrogen, together with a\r\ncorresponding decrease of oxygen, are well illustrated in the analyses,\r\nespecially in the strictly comparable series of peat samples from\r\nvarious depths. In this case there is also a steady decrease of\r\nhydrogen, and an increase of ash from 2.72% in the surface layer, to\r\n9.16 at 80 inches depth. This increase is due in the main, of course,\r\nto the progressive volatilization of the organic matter in the forms of\r\ncarbonic dioxid and marsh gas (methan, CH₄).\r\n\r\nIn considering this table it should not be forgotten that while normal\r\nhumus stands very close to peat, and the latter when compressed in\r\ncertain stages would be undistinguishable from lignite or brown coal;\r\nyet both peat and lignite are known to be formed under conditions\r\npermitting much less access of air or oxygen than occurs in the\r\nformation of normal black soil-humus. Hence even black peat cannot at\r\nonce stand in place of soil-humus when removed from its watery bed, but\r\nrequires considerable time and aeration (oxidation), and in most cases\r\nneutralization with lime or marl, before it can serve the purposes of\r\nhumus in the soil.\r\n\r\n    Lignite and the progressively more carbonaceous coals\r\n    are and have been formed under the conjoined action of\r\n    submergence and pressure, sometimes also aided by heat; and\r\n    thus they cannot perform the function of soil-humus, any\r\n    more than the fire-clays or shales underlying them can resume\r\n    their original soil-functions without prolonged weathering.\r\n\r\n    _Amounts of Humus and Coal Formed from Vegetable\r\n    Matter._—Only very general and indefinite estimates\r\n    can be given of the amount of humus or coal formed from a\r\n    given quantity of vegetable matter, since these must vary\r\n    according to the conditions under which the transformation\r\n    occurs. The greater or less access of air and of moisture,\r\n    the temperature and pressure under which the process occurs,\r\n    will modify very materially the quantitative as well as\r\n    the qualitative result. In the hot arid regions the fallen\r\n    leaves may wholly disappear by oxidation on the surface of\r\n    the ground, while under humid conditions they are mostly\r\n    incorporated with the surface soil. If we assume that in\r\n    the humification of plant debris (estimating their average\r\n    nitrogen content at 1%), no nitrogen is lost, it would seem\r\n    that in the humid region one part of normal soil-humus might\r\n    be formed from 5 to 6 parts of (dry) plant debris; while\r\n    in the extreme regime of the arid regions, from 18 to 20\r\n    parts of the same would be required. But as most probably\r\n    some nitrogen also is lost in the process of humification, a\r\n    considerably larger proportion of original substance may be\r\n    actually required.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.—Section of lignitized log showing contraction\r\ninto solid lignite on drying.]\r\n\r\n    As to coal, it is usually assumed that it requires about\r\n    8 parts of vegetable matter for one of bituminous coal.\r\n    Much higher estimates are made by some, and an observation\r\n    made by the writer at the Port Hudson bluff, Mississippi,\r\n    in 1869, would seem to justify such estimates. The\r\n    above figure, from a sketch made at the time, shows the\r\n    proportions to which a pine log about eight inches in\r\n    diameter had shrunk in drying into a small sheet of\r\n    lignitized wood; the original trunk, projecting from a bed\r\n    of sand some forty feet below the surface, being so porous\r\n    and spongy that when wet it flattened somewhat by its own\r\n    weight; it was connected with the little sheet of lignite by\r\n    a spirally twisted, tapering stipe.\r\n\r\n    Here evidently the proportion of lignite formed was a very\r\n    minute one, doubtless because of the long leaching to which\r\n    the trunk had been subjected. It thus seems impossible, as\r\n    in the case of humus, to assign any definite proportion as\r\n    between woody matter and coal formed from it.\r\n\r\n_Normal humification_ takes place only under the influence of moderate\r\ntemperature. When the temperature is too low, bacterial and fungous\r\ngrowth are repressed or arrested; when too high, the fungous vegetation\r\nassumes a different phase, the result of which is the almost total\r\noxidation of the organic matter, sometimes so accelerated as to\r\ninitiate rapid combustion “fire-fanging” of dung; leaving in any case\r\nbut a trifling organic residue of very high ash contents.[44]\r\n\r\n[44] A striking illustration of this is afforded by Naegeli’s\r\nexperiment of enclosing several loaves of bread in a loosely closed\r\ntin-box. After eighteen months there remained only seventeen per cent\r\nof air-dry mouldy matter, totally destitute of starch.\r\n\r\n_Eremacausis._—In the absence of a sufficient degree of moisture to\r\nco-operate with the other agencies of humification, the final result\r\nin the soil is practically the same as in the “fire-fanging” of dung.\r\nThe organic matter is almost wholly destroyed by direct oxidation\r\n(eremacausis) with or without the aid of minute organisms; leaving\r\nessentially only the ash behind to be reincorporated with the soil.\r\nThis is to a very great extent the predominant process in the arid\r\nregions of the Globe; most of the soils formed in these climates being,\r\ntherefore, very poor in humus-substances, and deriving it almost\r\nentirely from the decay of roots only.\r\n\r\nThe extent to which the humus of a soil may be derived from the\r\nvegetable debris falling or growing upon the surface, varies greatly\r\nwith the climatic conditions as well with the nature of the soil. In\r\nthe forests of humid climates with loamy soils, not only does the\r\nautumnal leaf-fall, as well as decaying twigs and trunks, become\r\nobviously incorporated with the surface soil as decay progresses on the\r\nlower surface, but active animal agencies (see below) carry the organic\r\nremnants bodily down. But where heavy clay soils prevail, these animal\r\nagencies are much restricted by the compactness of the material; only a\r\nlight surface-layer of mold would be formed, and the humus of the lower\r\nsoil layers must of necessity be derived from the decay of the roots\r\nonly. This origin is claimed by Kosticheff[45] for the high content\r\nof black humus in the tchernozem or black earth of Russia. Following\r\nHellriegel in determining the weight of roots contained in successive\r\nequal layers of soil from the surface downwards, Kosticheff gives for\r\neach six inches the following data as found in the tchernozem, taking\r\nas 100 the root-content of the surface layer:\r\n\r\n    ===========+======+======+======+======+======+======\r\n      Number.  |  1   |  1   |  2   |  2   |  3   |  3\r\n      Depth.   |Roots.|Humus.|Roots.|Humus.|Roots.|Humus.\r\n    -----------+------+------+------+------+------+------\r\n     6 inches. |100.  | 5.42 |100.  | 8.11 |100.  | 9.64\r\n    12   “     | 89.1 | 4.83 | 63.9 | 5.19 | 80.3 | 7.77\r\n    18   “     | 66.9 | 3.62 | 48.3 | 3.92 | 70.0 | 6.71\r\n    24   “     | 47.3 | 2.56 | 35.0 | 2.84 | 58.4 | 5.61\r\n    30   “     | 47.3 | 2.59 | 26.0 | 2.11 | 38.2 | 3.57\r\n    36   “     | 34.6 | 1.88 | 18.1 | 1.47 | 33.0 | 3.18\r\n    42   “     | 23.9 | 1.29 |  6.3 |  .51 | 16.2 | 1.56\r\n    48   “     | 14.4 |  .78 |      |  .70 |      |\r\n    54   “     |  6.7 |  .36 |      |      |      |\r\n    -----------+------+------+------+------+------+------\r\n\r\n[45] Abstract in Ann. de la Science Agronomique, Tome 2, 1887.\r\n\r\n    It will be seen that there is a very close correspondence of\r\n    the humus content with the root development in the several\r\n    layers, and it seems as if though but little of the humus\r\n    could be derived from the surface growth, which is that of\r\n    the grasses of the steppe.\r\n\r\n    The climate of the black-earth country of Russia is, though\r\n    not properly arid, yet one of rather deficient and uncertain\r\n    rainfall. But as a consequence of extremely arid conditions,\r\n    and in sandy lands, it may even happen that the immediate\r\n    surface soil contains _less_ humus than what, in the\r\n    farmers’ habitual parlance, would be called the subsoil;\r\n    because of the penetration of slow combustion for some\r\n    distance into the porous soils. It will then be lower down\r\n    that, in the presence of a favorable degree of moisture and\r\n    lower temperature, the conditions of normal humification are\r\n    fulfilled.\r\n\r\nIt is not always, then, that the commonly recognized distinction\r\nbetween surface soil and subsoil based upon humus content can be\r\nmaintained. But the observation of everything bearing upon this point\r\nis of the utmost importance in determining both the agricultural value\r\nand the mode of treatment of the land.\r\n\r\n_Losses of Humus from Cultivation and Fallowing._—The fact that humus\r\naccumulates in woodlands and meadows, where no cultivation is given,\r\nwould naturally lead to the converse conclusion, viz., that cultivation\r\ncauses loss of humus and of its constituents. That this is actually\r\nthe case is recognized and widely acted upon in practice, and there is\r\nno question that the general acceptance of stable manure as the most\r\nwidely useful fertilizer, despite its usually low content of plant-food\r\ningredients, is based upon the fact that it supplies vegetable matter,\r\nin a condition highly favorable to its conversion into humus. The most\r\ndirect and cogent proof of the depletion of the soil of both humus and\r\nnitrogen by continuous cultivation of cereal grains has been given\r\nby Snyder,[46] who determined the loss both of humus and of nitrogen\r\nsuffered by a Minnesota soil during eight years’ continuous cultivation\r\nof wheat. The total loss of nitrogen was 1700 pounds per acre, while\r\nonly 350 pounds were utilized by the crop; about 1400 pounds being\r\ndissipated as gas or leached out as nitrates. A conservative estimate\r\nof the loss of humus suffered during the same period was about a ton\r\nper acre annually, and this loss seriously decreased not only the\r\nnitrogen-content, but rendered the soil more compact and less retentive\r\nof moisture. But by rotation of the wheat with clover in alternate\r\nyears, very nearly an equilibrium of both humus and nitrogen-content\r\nwas obtained. In addition, the amount of available mineral plant-food\r\nwas decreased by continuous grain culture. Ladd has made similar\r\nobservations in North Dakota, with similar results.\r\n\r\n[46] Bull. No. 70 Minn. Exp’t Station, 1905.\r\n\r\nThat excessive aeration results in serious losses of humus as well as\r\nof nitrogen, is very obvious in the arid region, where it is the habit\r\nto maintain on the surface of orchards and vineyards during the dry,\r\nhot summers, a thick mulch of well-tilled soil, thus preventing loss of\r\nwater by evaporation. In the course of years this surface soil becomes\r\nso badly depleted of humus that good tilth becomes impossible, the soil\r\nbecoming light-colored and compacted; while the loss of nitrogen is\r\nindicated by the small size of the orchard fruits. Similar losses are\r\nof course sustained in the practice of bare summer-fallow, which at one\r\ntime was almost universal in portions of the arid region. The complete\r\nextirpation of weed growth thus brought about, at first considered an\r\nunmixed benefit, has ultimately had to be made up for by the practice\r\nof green-manuring; since in the arid region the use of stable manure\r\nencounters many difficulties.\r\n\r\n    _Estimation of Humus in Soils._ It has been usual to\r\n    determine the amount of humus in soils by means of (dry or\r\n    wet) combustion, calculating the humus from the carbonic\r\n    dioxid so formed, while measuring the nitrogen gas directly.\r\n    But in this process the entire organic matter of the soil,\r\n    humified and unhumified, is indiscriminately included;\r\n    and it is wholly uncertain to what extent the latter will\r\n    ultimately become humus, from the nitrification of which\r\n    plants are presumed to chiefly derive their nitrogen.[47] In\r\n    order to obtain definite results, the actual, functional\r\n    humus must be extracted from the soil mass by some solvent\r\n    which discriminates between the humified and unhumified\r\n    organic matter. This cannot be done by direct extraction\r\n    with caustic soda or potash, which inevitably dissolve\r\n    unhumified matters and tend to expel ammonia from the humus;\r\n    besides themselves acting as humifiers (see this chapter, p.\r\n    125.)\r\n\r\n    _Grandeau Method: Matière Noire._—The only method\r\n    now known which accomplishes this separation, practically\r\n    excluding the unhumified while fully dissolving the humified\r\n    matter—is that of _Grandeau_: the extraction of the\r\n    soil, first with dilute acid, in order to set the humic\r\n    substances free from their combinations with lime and\r\n    magnesia; and their subsequent extraction with moderately\r\n    dilute solutions of ammonia (or other alkali hydrates). Upon\r\n    the evaporation of the ammonia solution the humus is left\r\n    behind in the form of a black lustrous substance (“matière\r\n    noire” of Grandeau) much resembling the crust of soot formed\r\n    in flues from wood fires. As it contains a variable amount\r\n    of ash, it must be burnt and the ash subtracted from the\r\n    first weight.\r\n\r\n[47] The humus determinations thus made, which include nearly all\r\nthose made by German chemists, give the humus-content from 40 to 50%\r\ntoo high. The French determinations are mostly made by the method of\r\nGrandeau.\r\n\r\n_Amounts of Humus in Soils._—While in peat, marsh and muck lands the\r\nhumus-content may rise above twenty per cent, in ordinary cultivated\r\nlands it rarely exceeds about five per cent, and very commonly falls\r\nbelow three per cent, even in the humid regions. In properly arid soils\r\nwe find a very much lower average, rarely exceeding one per cent,\r\nand frequently falling to .30 and even less. This scarcity of humus\r\nmanifests itself plainly in the prevalently light gray tint of the arid\r\nsoils.\r\n\r\nMeadows and woodlands generally show the highest humus-content in their\r\nsurface soils, gradually increasing while in that condition; while when\r\ntaken into cultivation the humus-content gradually decreases, owing\r\nto the free aeration and consequent “burning-out” caused by tillage.\r\nHence the humus must be from time to time replaced by the use of stable\r\nmanure, or green-manure crops, to prevent injurious changes in the\r\ntilling qualities of the land. Not only humus as such, but according to\r\nSchloesing also the insoluble colloid humates, produce in the soil a\r\nloosening effect or tilth (Germ. Bodengare), which apparently cannot be\r\nbrought about by any other substance.[48]\r\n\r\n[48] The decrease of humus from wheat culture in the soils of\r\nMinnesota and North Dakota has been studied by H. Snyder and E. F.\r\nLadd, respectively. In the prairie lands of the latter State the total\r\norganic matter in the first six inches of soil ranges from 15 to as\r\nmuch as 26%, and the humus alone from 4 to 7.8%.\r\n\r\n_Humates and Ulmates._—That the insoluble humates of lime, magnesia,\r\niron, manganese and alumina are present in most soils is conclusively\r\nshown by the composition of the solution obtained by the extraction\r\nof soils with weak acid, as above mentioned in connection with the\r\nquantitative determination of humus according to Grandeau; since\r\nthese bases are almost always extracted by the weak acid. When the\r\nbrown solution of alkali humate obtained in this process is carefully\r\nneutralized with sulfuric or hydrochloric acid, or is mixed with\r\nsolutions of the above bases, flocculent, insoluble precipitates are\r\nformed, while the solution is discolored. Similar precipitates may be\r\nobtained with other metallic solutions, notably with that of copper,\r\nwhich precipitates the humus-acids most completely. Doubtless these\r\ncompounds contribute greatly to the conservation of the humus-content\r\nof soils, protecting it to a certain extent from oxidation, and also\r\npreventing excessive acidity. The brown tint of certain subsoils in\r\nthe northern humid regions have been shown by Tollens and others to\r\nbe due not to ferric hydrate, as had been supposed, but to calcic,\r\nmagnesic and aluminic humates. _None of the mineral bases or acids\r\npresent can be detected in the humic solution by the usual reagents._\r\n\r\n_Mineral Ingredients in Humus._—That the mineral plant-food ingredients\r\npresent in the humus extracted by the Grandeau process, and which\r\nremain as ash when the matière noire is burned, are capable of\r\nnourishing plant growth, was directly shown by Grandeau, Snyder and\r\nothers. The former was inclined to consider that those substances were\r\nmainly thus taken up by plants, under natural conditions. This theory,\r\nhowever, has not been sustained by subsequent investigations; the\r\nmineral plant-food thus extracted is not a measure of the immediate\r\nproductiveness of the soils, as demonstrated by Snyder, and the\r\nresidual soils are not sterile. It is also still doubtful to what\r\nextent the mineral bases and acids are _naturally_ combined with the\r\nhumus-substances, it being contended by some that they are brought\r\ninto organic combination by the acid and ammonia extraction. The\r\ninvestigations of Snyder and Ladd, above referred to, prove however to\r\nsome extent at least that the humus-substances are naturally combined\r\nwith them, and that probably they are largely made available to plants\r\nthrough the direct and indirect action of the humus compounds. This\r\nsubject is farther considered in chapter 19.\r\n\r\nThe nature and amounts of these mineral substances are well exemplified\r\nin the subjoined full analysis by Snyder, of the ash of the humus and\r\nhumates extracted from a compound sample of prairie soils of Minnesota,\r\nwhich had been thrown down from the ammonia solution by simply\r\nneutralizing the liquid:[49]\r\n\r\n    ASH OF HUMUS FROM MINNESOTA PRAIRIE SOILS.\r\n\r\n    Insoluble matter[50]          61.97\r\n    Potash (K₂O)                  7.50\r\n    Soda (Na₂O)                   8.13\r\n    Lime (CaO)                    0.09\r\n    Magnesia (MgO)                0.36\r\n    Peroxid of Iron (Fe₂O₃)       3.12\r\n    Alumina (Al₂O₃)               3.48\r\n    Phosphoric acid (P₂O₅)       12.37\r\n    Sulfuric acid (SO₃)            .98\r\n    Carbonic acid (CO₂)           1.64\r\n\r\n[49] Precipitation with an excess of acid does not greatly change the\r\nresults.\r\n\r\n[50] In California soils this is mostly silica soluble in carbonate of\r\nsoda.\r\n\r\nThe large amounts of the soluble alkalies potash and soda thrown\r\ndown with the humic matters are very striking, as is the very large\r\nproportion of phosphoric acid. Lime and magnesia had, of course, been\r\nmainly eliminated by the preliminary acid treatment.\r\n\r\n_Functions of the Unhumified Organic Matter._—The unhumified plant\r\ndebris in the soil are not to be regarded as useless, even aside\r\nfrom their potential conversion into active humus. Not only do these\r\nremnants of vegetation lighten the soil, rendering it more pervious\r\nto air and water, but in their progressive decay they give off\r\ncarbonic gas, which is active in soil-decomposition; and they serve as\r\nnourishment to the soil bacteria upon which its thriftiness so greatly\r\ndepends. See below, chapter 9.\r\n\r\n_The Nitrogen-Content of Humus._—Since soil-humus is doubtless the\r\nchief depository of soil-nitrogen, and the main source from which,\r\nthrough the process of nitrification, the nitrogen-supply to plants\r\nis usually derived, its content of that element is a matter of\r\ngreat interest. It has been customary to estimate approximately the\r\nnitrogen-content of soils by the proportion of humus-substance present;\r\nand as the light tints of the soils of the arid region indicate a small\r\nhumus-content, a scarcity of nitrogen seemed to be also indicated\r\nfor these lands. As this in a number of cases did not seem to accord\r\nwith actual experience, an investigation of the subject was made at\r\nthe California experiment station,[51] with the results shown in the\r\nsubjoined table. In considering these results it must be kept in mind\r\nthat while arid conditions can rarely be fulfilled in the humid region,\r\nhumid conditions are quite frequently locally represented in the arid,\r\nin lowlands and on high mountains; while moderately moist benchlands\r\nrepresent the semi-arid regime.\r\n\r\n[51] _Hilgard and Jaffa._ On the Nitrogen-content of Soil-humus in the\r\nHumid and Arid regions.

average.\r\n\r\nIt thus appears that on the average the humus of the arid soils\r\ncontains about three and a half times as much nitrogen as that of the\r\nhumid; that in the extreme cases, the difference goes as high as over\r\nsix to one (see Nos. 37 and 704); and that in the latter cases, the\r\nnitrogen-percentage in the arid humus considerably exceeds that of the\r\nalbuminoid group, the flesh-forming substances.\r\n\r\nIt thus becomes intelligible that in the arid region a humus-percentage\r\nwhich under humid conditions would justly be considered entirely\r\ninadequate for the success of normal crops, may nevertheless suffice\r\neven for the more exacting ones. This is more clearly seen on\r\ninspection of the figures in the third column, which represent the\r\nproduct resulting from the multiplication of the humus-percentage of\r\nthe soil into the nitrogen-percentage of its humus; as appears in\r\ncomparing the respective averages, or Nos. 1167 and 110 and others. An\r\nadditional consideration is the probable greater ease with which the\r\nnitrifying bacteria can act upon a material so rich in nitrogen.\r\n\r\nWe must not, then, be misled by the smallness of many humus-percentages\r\nin the arid region, into an assumption of a deficiency in the supply of\r\nsoil-nitrogen.\r\n\r\n    _Decrease of Nitrogen-Content in Humus with\r\n    Depth._—Since the oxidation of the carbon and hydrogen\r\n    in the humus-substance, and the consequent increase of its\r\n    relative nitrogen-content, are manifestly dependent upon the\r\n    presence of air and heat, it is reasonably to be expected\r\n    that the nitrogen-percentage of the humus should decrease\r\n    with the depth of the soil. That this is really the case\r\n    is plainly shown in the subjoined table, which gives the\r\n    humus-percentages and the nitrogen-content of the humus from\r\n    the surface foot down to twelve feet, in a soil on the bench\r\n    of the Russian River, Cal., which is sub-irrigated, and\r\n    liable to more or less rainfall during the summer. It will\r\n    be seen that not only does the absolute humus-percentage\r\n    decrease quite regularly down to seven feet, at which point\r\n    there evidently was at one time a strong root development,\r\n    causing a notable increase of the humus-content; from which\r\n    again there is a regular decrease down to the twelfth\r\n    foot. It will be noted that the nitrogen-percentage in the\r\n    humus, while not decreasing with the same regularity as the\r\n    humus-content itself, yet exhibits a general recession from\r\n    5.30 to 1.15 in the ninth foot, to which direct oxidation\r\n    doubtless never penetrates.\r\n\r\n         HUMUS AND NITROGEN-CONTENT OF RUSSIAN RIVER SOIL.\r\n    ==============+==============+=================+================\r\n    Depth in feet.|  Per cent    |    Per cent     |  Per cent\r\n                  |    Humus     |    Nitrogen     | Humus-Nitrogen.\r\n                  |   in soil.   |    in Humus.    |  in soil.\r\n    --------------+--------------+-----------------+----------------\r\n           1      |     1.21     |      5.30       |   .064\r\n           2      |     1.16     |      4.32       |   .054\r\n           3      |     1.14     |      3.87       |   .044\r\n           4      |     1.17     |      3.76       |   .044\r\n           5      |      .74     |      2.16       |   .016\r\n           6      |      .60     |      2.66       |   .016\r\n           7      |      .47     |      2.54       |   .012\r\n           8      |      .78     |      1.54       |   .012\r\n           9      |      .54     |      2.24       |   .012\r\n          10      |      .52     |      1.15       |   .006\r\n          11      |      .53     |      1.51       |   .008\r\n          12      |      .44     |      1.81       |   .008\r\n    --------------+--------------+-----------------+----------------\r\n\r\n_Influence of the Original Materials on the composition of Humus._—The\r\ngreat variability of the composition of humus formed from different\r\nsubstances is well shown in the subjoined table, representing the\r\nresults of experiments made by Snyder,[53] who caused various\r\nsubstances to humify by mixing the pulverized material intimately with\r\na soil poor in humus, and allowing the process to continue for a year.\r\nAt the end of that time the humus formed was extracted by the method of\r\nGrandeau, outlined above, and analyzed, with the following results.\r\n\r\n    ========+======+======+=======+======+========+=======+==========\r\n            |Sugar.| Oat  | Green |Wheat |Sawdust.| Meat  |  Cow\r\n            |      |Straw.|Clover.|Flour.|        |Scraps.|Manure.[54]\r\n    --------+------+------+-------+------+--------+-------+----------\r\n    Carbon  | 57.84| 54.30|  54.22| 51.02|  49.28 |  48.77|   41.93\r\n    Hydrogen|  3.04|  2.48|   3.40|  3.82|   3.33 |   4.30|    6.26\r\n    Nitrogen|  0.08|  2.50|   8.24|  5.02|   0.32 |  10.96|    6.16\r\n    Oxygen  | 39.04| 40.72|  34.14| 40.14|  47.07 |  35.97|   45.63\r\n    --------+------+------+-------+------+--------+-------+----------\r\n            |100.00|100.00| 100.00|100.00| 100.00 | 100.00|  100.00\r\n    --------+------+------+-------+------+--------+-------+----------\r\n\r\n[53] Bull.

Considering that the nitrogen is\r\nprobably present in the amid form, it is natural that hydrogen should\r\nin a measure vary with it, as in the case of the clover, flour and\r\nmeat humus. Nitrogen being the most variable ingredient of humus, it\r\nseems probable that the variation of the proportion of the humus-amids\r\npresent is the most potent factor in the variability of the composition\r\nof natural soil-humus.\r\n\r\nArranging these results in the order of their nitrogen-content as in\r\nthe table below, we see that the latter approximately corresponds to\r\nthe original protein-content of the humified substances.\r\n\r\n    Humus from meat scraps    10.96 % Nitrogen.\r\n      “    “   green clover    8.24\r\n      “    “   cow manure      6.16\r\n      “    “   wheat flour     5.05\r\n      “    “   oat straw       2.50\r\n      “    “   sawdust          .32\r\n\r\nWhile the above data prove the correlation between the first products\r\nof humification and the original substance, it must be remembered that\r\nsubsequently, under proper conditions, the nitrogen-percentage in humus\r\nmay, in the course of time, increase very greatly, even to a proportion\r\nconsiderably above that contained in flesh itself. When we consider\r\nthat ordinarily, the latter, and the albuminoid substances generally,\r\ndecompose in contact with air with an abundant evolution of ammonia\r\ncompounds, sometimes leaving only a little fat (adipocere) behind, it\r\nis surprising that the decomposition _within_ the soil should have\r\nexactly the opposite result, viz., an _accumulation_ of the nitrogen.\r\nThe causes of this marked difference are not yet well understood, but\r\nit is probably due to the differences in the kinds of bacteria that are\r\nactive in the two cases.\r\n\r\nSnyder has also shown that the richer the organic matter humified is\r\nin nitrogen, the more energetically it acts in rendering available\r\nthe mineral matters of the soil for plant nutrition. Correspondingly,\r\nLadd[55] has shown that with the increase of humus in the soil, there\r\nis also a corresponding increase in the amounts of mineral plant-food\r\nextracted from the soil by a four per cent solution of ammonia, such as\r\nis employed in the Grandeau method of humus-determination.\r\n\r\n[55] Bull., S.

Extended researches\r\nby Adametz, Schloesing and Müntz, Miquel, Koch, Fraenkel, Winogradsky,\r\nFrank and many others, have thrown light upon the immense numbers and\r\ngreat variety of minute organisms, especially of the bacterial group,\r\npresent in soils, and upon their distribution and activities in the\r\nsame. It has been shown that their numbers are greatest near (although\r\nusually not at) the surface, decreasing rapidly downward and generally\r\ndisappearing wholly at depths between seven and eight feet; the latter\r\ndepth varying of course according to the nature and porosity of the\r\nsoil, and both depth and numbers being greatest in summer.\r\n\r\n_Numbers of Bacteria in Soils._—Adametz found in one gram of soil,\r\n38,000 bacteria at the surface, 460,000 at ten inches depth; in a\r\nloam soil at the surface 500,000, at ten inches 464,000 in each gram\r\nof earth. Of mould and similar fungous germs there were only 40 to 50\r\nin the same, 6 species being true molds, while four were ferments,\r\nincluding the yeasts of wine and beer. Fraenkel found in virgin land\r\nfrom near Potsdam, a sudden, marked decrease at depths of from three\r\nto five feet; while in earth from inhabited places within the city of\r\nBerlin, considerable numbers were still present at eight and even ten\r\nfeet, in some cases.\r\n\r\nIn the researches lately made by Hohl at the bacteriological station\r\nat Liebefeld, near Bern, it was found that in cultivated soils the\r\nnumber of bacteria greatly exceeds the figures given by Fraenkel.\r\nHe found a gram of moist soil to contain from three to fifteen\r\nmillions of bacteria. In the cultivated soil of Liebefeld he found\r\n5,750,000, in meadow land 9,400,000, in a manure pile 44,500,000 per\r\ncubic centimeter. These figures seem high for so small a quantity\r\nof material, but taking the average size of a bacterium, a cubic\r\ncentimeter might readily contain six hundred millions. (Grandeau, Ann.\r\nSci. Agronomique, vol. 1, p. 461, 1905).\r\n\r\n    Mayo and Kinsley (Rep. Kansas Exp’t Station for 1902-3) have\r\n    made elaborate investigations of the numbers and kinds of\r\n    bacteria found in various soils in Kansas, in connection\r\n    with different crops. It is noteworthy that in most cases\r\n    their figures exceed considerably those given by European\r\n    observers, as they often reach high into the millions, in\r\n    one case to over fifty millions, per cubic centimeter.[56]\r\n\r\n[56] The mode of statement in the paper is not always quite clear as\r\nto the manner in which the averages given were calculated. It must be\r\nremembered that these data refer to cubic centimeters of soil, or about\r\ntwice the amount (1 gram) used by European observers.\r\n\r\n    Five fields with different soils were investigated; the\r\n    land being described as follows: “Field No. 1 is a black\r\n    loam containing considerable humus; field No. 2 is similar\r\n    to field 1 but contains more humus; field No. 3 is a thin\r\n    soil with clay gumbo subsoil; fields Nos. 4 and 5 are black\r\n    loams, but not as rich in humus as either No. 1 or No. 2.”\r\n\r\n    The average bacterial contents of the several fields are\r\n    given as follows:\r\n\r\n    Field No. 1   33,931,747 per cubic centimeter.\r\n      “   No. 2   53,596,060  “   “        “\r\n      “   No. 3       78,534  “   “        “\r\n      “   No. 4    8,643,006  “   “        “\r\n      “   No. 5    3,192,131  “   “        “\r\n\r\n    “The crop records of these fields for the past ten years\r\n    indicate that the crop yield has been (more or less?)\r\n    directly proportional to the bacterial content of the soil\r\n    of each field; field 2 has produced the largest yield, field\r\n    3 the least.”\r\n\r\n    Unfortunately no chemical analyses of any of these soils are\r\n    communicated; but at the request of the writer samples of\r\n    the soils of the first three fields were sent from the\r\n    Kansas station for humus determinations (courteously made by\r\n    Dr. H. C. Myers), which gave the following results:\r\n\r\n    Field No. 1   2.19% of Humus.\r\n      “   No. 2   3.07% “    “\r\n      “   No. 3   1.85% “    “\r\n\r\n    While these humus-percentages are not directly proportional\r\n    to the bacterial content, a favoring effect of high\r\n    humus-content is clearly shown. The bacterial and the\r\n    humus-content of these soils are sensibly, even if not\r\n    directly, correlated; which might reasonably be expected,\r\n    since the organic matter and the humus are the bacterial\r\n    food.\r\n\r\n    The investigation also showed wide differences in the\r\n    bacterial content of the same soil when different crops\r\n    were growing on it. Thus in samples taken on Aug. 15, there\r\n    were found in the first twelve inches of a black loam soil\r\n    bearing timothy and clover, 1,380,000, in the same with\r\n    alfalfa and clover, 21,091,000, with maize from one to over\r\n    two millions. In soils from the western part of Kansas,\r\n    the bacterial content of the same crops was much less (as\r\n    doubtless is the humus-content), and it is noteworthy that\r\n    the prairie buffalo grass shows throughout a relatively high\r\n    bacterial content in the first foot of the soil, ranging\r\n    next to alfalfa. The root bacteria living on the legumes\r\n    will naturally increase the bacterial content of the soils\r\n    on which they grow, more than plants which, like maize, do\r\n    not directly utilize bacterial action.\r\n\r\n    _Multiplication of the Bacteria._—Marshall Ward and\r\n    Duclaux have made some special observations in regard to\r\n    the rapidity with which certain bacteria multiply. Duclaux\r\n    summarizes the final conclusion thus: taking as a basis\r\n    the time of 35 minutes for the subdivision into two, which\r\n    has been frequently observed by Ward, there would be four\r\n    millions of bacteria produced in twelve hours. The first\r\n    filaments had plenty of room in a drop culture of one cubic\r\n    millimeter; but at the end their total volume amounted to\r\n    the tenth part of the total volume of the drop. At the above\r\n    rate, making 48 generations in 24 hours, 281,500 billions\r\n    of organisms would be produced. (Grandeau, Ann. Sci. Agron.\r\n    Vol. 1, 1905, p. 456).\r\n\r\n_Aerobic and Anaerobic Bacteria._—As may readily be inferred, the\r\ncultural and other surface conditions exert a potent influence both\r\nupon the kinds and abundance of the bacteria and molds; since the\r\nlife-functions of some are dependent upon the presence of free oxygen\r\n(“aerobic”), while others flourish best, or only, in the absence of\r\nair (“anaerobic”), or are able to avail themselves of the presence\r\nof _combined_ oxygen, by reduction of oxids present. Their number is\r\nfound, in general, to be greatest in cultivated lands, and bacteria\r\nare there by far predominant over the moulds. On the other hand, the\r\nmoulds gain precedence in woodlands and meadows, at least so far as air\r\ncan gain access; while in the deeper layers of the same, as well as in\r\npeaty lands, bacterial life is always scanty. This holds particularly\r\nin respect to the nitrifying organisms, and others whose life-functions\r\nare dependent upon abundant access of oxygen (aerobic).\r\n\r\n_Food Material Required._—All bacteria, like the fungi, are dependent\r\nfor their development upon the presence of adequate amounts of some\r\norganic food-material, best apparently in water-soluble form. In the\r\nsoil it seems to be chiefly compounds of the carbohydrate group,\r\nespecially various gums derived from the decaying plant substance, or\r\nfrom stable manure; in artificial cultures, glucose is mostly found\r\nto be a highly available food. When the decaying substance reaches\r\nthe state of humus, the latter seems to be available as food only to\r\ncomparatively few bacteria. The very abundant development of bacterial\r\nlife seems to be among the most important effects produced by stable\r\nmanure upon the surface soil, in establishing good tilth (“Bodengare”\r\nin German).\r\n\r\n_Functions of the Bacteria._—While there is still much uncertainty as\r\nto the exact functions performed by most of these bacteria in respect\r\nto soil-formation and plant growth, there are several kinds whose\r\nactivity has been proved to be of the utmost importance in one or both\r\ndirections; it having been shown that when the soil is sterilized\r\neither by heat or antiseptic agents, certain essential processes are\r\ncompletely suppressed until the soil is re-infected and the conditions\r\nof bacterial life restored.\r\n\r\nProbably the chief in importance are those connected with the processes\r\nof _nitrification_ and _denitrification_, bearing as they do upon the\r\nsupply to plants of the most costly of the three substances furnished\r\nby fertilizers. These organisms have been first extensively studied by\r\nWinogradsky, while the conditions of their activity have been largely\r\ndeveloped by R. Warington.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.—Nitrosomonas. (Winogradsky).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.—Nitrobacterium. (Winogradsky).]\r\n\r\n_Nitrifying Bacteria._—The conversion of ammonia into nitrates is\r\naccomplished under proper conditions by two organisms, or groups of\r\norganisms; the first stage being the formation of nitrites by the\r\nround, often flagellate cells of _nitrosomonas_ (or nitrosococcus).\r\nThe second, the oxidation of the nitrites into nitrates by very minute\r\nrod-shaped bacilli, named _nitrobacteria_. The conditions under which\r\nthese bacteria can act are quite definite in that, aside from a supply\r\nof the nitrifiable substance, a fairly high temperature (24° C. or 75°\r\nF.) and a moderate degree of moisture, there must be a free access of\r\noxygen (air); and there must be present a base (or its carbonate) with\r\nwhich the acids formed by oxidation can immediately unite. In an acid\r\nmedium (“sour” soils) nitrification promptly ceases; as it also does\r\nwhenever the amount of base present has been fully neutralized. The\r\nbases most favorable to nitrification are lime and magnesia in the form\r\nof carbonates, an excess of which does no harm; while in the case of\r\nthe carbonates of potash and soda, the amount must be strictly limited.\r\n\r\n    _Conditions of Activity._—Dumont and Crochetelle found\r\n    that up to .25 per cent, potassic carbonate acted favorably\r\n    on the process; which was, however, completely stopped by\r\n    as much as .8 per ct. Warington has shown that ammonic\r\n    carbonate similarly prevents nitrification when exceeding\r\n    about .37 per ct. Ammonia salts in general appear to be\r\n    antagonistic to the transformation of nitrites into nitrates.\r\n\r\nAside from the carbonates, some neutral salts favor nitrification very\r\nmarkedly; while others tend to depress it. Deherain found that .5 per\r\ncent of common salt suffices to prevent nitrification altogether, while\r\nsmaller amounts retard it proportionally. According to Dumont and\r\nCrochetelle, potassium chlorid acts favorably up to .3 per cent, but at\r\n.8 per cent suppresses nitrification. Earthy and alkaline sulfates, on\r\nthe contrary, seem to act favorably throughout, at least up to .5 per\r\ncent. This is especially true of gypsum, which, according to Pichard,\r\naccelerates the process more than any other substance known. Taking\r\nthe effect of gypsum as the maximum, he found that, other things being\r\nequal, the amounts of nitrates formed were as shown in the table below,\r\nthe effect of gypsum being taken as 100:\r\n\r\n    Gypsum               100\r\n    Sodic Sulfate         47.9\r\n    Potassic Sulfate      35.8\r\n    Calcic Carbonate      13.3\r\n    Magnesic Carbonate    12.5\r\n\r\n    The above estimates are markedly confirmed by the\r\n    observations of the writer in the alkali soils of\r\n    California. In these, nitrates exist most abundantly when\r\n    the salts contained in the soil are mainly sulfates; while\r\n    wherever common salt or sodic carbonate are present in\r\n    considerable amounts, the amounts of nitrate found are\r\n    notably less. In saline seashore lands nitrates are usually\r\n    present in traces only. Wollny has moreover shown that\r\n    the nitrates themselves exert a repressive influence on\r\n    nitrification.\r\n\r\n_Effects of Aeration and Reduction._—While the fostering effect of\r\nsulfates upon nitrification is very energetic in well aerated soils,\r\nthey become injurious whenever by a reductive process in ill-drained\r\nlands, the sulfates are reduced to sulfids. Under such conditions\r\nthe process will in any case be much impaired. On the other hand,\r\nthe favoring effect of abundant aeration was strikingly shown in\r\nthe experiment made by Deherain, in which a cubic meter of soil was\r\nleft unmoved for several months, while a similar mass was thoroughly\r\nagitated once a week during the same time. The proportion of nitrates\r\nformed in the latter case was as 70 to 1 formed in the quiescent soil\r\nmass. It follows that the intensity of nitrification is essentially\r\ndependent upon the porosity of the soil; and that it is thus greatly\r\nfavored in the pervious soil-strata of the arid regions. It also\r\nfollows that thorough and frequent tillage and fallowing greatly favor\r\nnitrification; thus explaining one of the beneficial results of these\r\noperations. At the same time, it is true that we may thus in a short\r\ntime seriously diminish the reserve stock of nitrogen contained in the\r\nsoil in the form of humus-amids; and since nitrates are exceedingly\r\nliable to be lost from the soil in several ways, such excessive\r\nnitrification is to be avoided.\r\n\r\n_Unhumified Organic Matter does not Nitrify._—There can be little doubt\r\nthat the formation of ammonia from the amido-compounds in humus is\r\nalso the work of bacteria; but this, really the initial phase of the\r\nnitrogen-nutrition of plants, has not yet been fully elucidated. That,\r\nhowever, it is essentially only the ready-formed humus and not the\r\nunhumified debris of the soil which participate in nitrification was\r\nshown by the experiments of the writer, see chapter 19.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.—Bacillus denitrificans I. (Burri.)]\r\n\r\n_Denitrifying Bacteria._—Among the sources of _loss of nitrates_ in\r\nthe soil is the action of denitrifying bacteria; some of which cause\r\nmerely the reduction of nitrates to nitrites and progressively to\r\nammonia, while others cause gaseous nitrogen to be given off from\r\nnitrites and nitrates, resulting in their complete loss to the soil.\r\nWhile there are probably several kinds of the latter class, the most\r\nrapidly effective is an organism contained abundantly in fresh horse\r\ndung, and also on the surface of old straw. This can readily be shown\r\nby subjecting a very dilute solution (1-3 per cent.) of Chile saltpeter\r\nto the action of fresh horse dung in a close flask, when nitrogen and\r\ncarbonic dioxid gases are evolved, and in a few days the nitrate has\r\ntotally disappeared. In the course of time this power of horse-manure\r\ndisappears; so that “rotted manure” is practically free from it and\r\nunder proper conditions serves nitrification so effectively, that in\r\nthe past it has served extensively for the production of saltpeter in\r\nthe “niter-plantations” for the industrial purposes; the material\r\nof which was loose earth, marl and manure, kept moist and frequently\r\nforked over for better aeration. Saltpeter is similarly produced in\r\nstables, corroding the mortar of brick foundations. Nevertheless, it\r\nis necessary to avoid the use, either together or at short intervals\r\napart, of Chile saltpeter and fresh manure; the manure if used first\r\nshould be allowed to remain at least two months in the soil before\r\nsaltpeter is applied.\r\n\r\n    The reduction of nitrates to nitrites and ammonia is brought\r\n    about by quite a number of bacteria, mostly anaerobic,\r\n    and such as consume combined oxygen in their development.\r\n    Thus the butyric ferment, which in the absence of readily\r\n    reducible compounds evolves free hydrogen, will in presence\r\n    of nitrates reduce the latter to nitrites, or form ammonia\r\n    by addition of hydrogen to nitrogen just set free by\r\n    reduction. Such reductive processes of course occur chiefly\r\n    in soils rich in organic matter, or ill-aerated. The ammonia\r\n    so formed, while at first simply combining with any humus\r\n    acids present, may in the course of time be itself reduced\r\n    to the amidic condition, being thereby rendered relatively\r\n    inert, until again brought into action by ammonia-forming\r\n    bacteria.\r\n\r\n_Ammonia-forming Bacteria._—A large number of different bacteria appear\r\nto be concerned in the formation of ammonia from compounds of the\r\nalbuminoid group, (and probably from humus). Among these is one of the\r\nmost common in soils (_Bacillus mycoides_, root bacillus), which while\r\nforming ammonia carbonate in solutions of albumen, is also capable of\r\nreducing nitrates to nitrites and ammonia in presence of a nutritive\r\nsolution of sugar.\r\n\r\nThe “hay bacillus” (_B. subtilis_), so abundantly developed in hay\r\ninfusions, and one of the most abundant in cultivated soils, has\r\ntogether with B. ellenbachensis, B. megatherium, B. mycoides, and\r\nothers, by some been credited with important action in favoring\r\nvegetation; so that a fairly pure culture of B. ellenbachensis has\r\nbeen brought out commercially in Germany under the name of “Alinit.”\r\nRigorous culture experiments made by Stutzer and others have,\r\nhowever, failed to show any general benefit from the use of alinit in\r\ninfecting either land or seeds. But there is no doubt of the _Effects\r\nof Bacterial Life on Physical Soil Conditions._—It is apparent that\r\nall conditions favoring the life of aerobic (air-needing) bacteria\r\ntend also to produce the loose, porous state (tilth) of the surface\r\nsoil so conducive to the welfare of culture plants, designated by\r\nGerman agriculturists as “Bodengare.” Whether or not this condition is\r\ndirectly due to bacterial processes, as is thought by Stutzer (Landw.\r\nPresse, 1904, No. 11) it is assuredly a highly important point to\r\nbe gained, and is essentially connected with the presence of humus\r\nin adequate amounts, which is also a favoring condition of abundant\r\nbacterial life. It seems that the preference given to the shallow\r\nputting-in, or even surface application of stable manure, existing in\r\nEurope, is largely based upon the marked effect upon the looseness of\r\nthe surface soil, generally credited to the physical effect of the\r\nmanure substance itself, but apparently largely due to the intensity of\r\nbacterial action thus brought about.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.—Bacillus subtilis.

Bacteriology.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.—Bacillus megaterium. (From Migula.)]\r\n\r\nROOT-BACTERIA OR RHIZOBIA OF LEGUMES.—Among the most important\r\nbacteria, agriculturally, is that which enables plants of the\r\nleguminous order—(peas, beans, vetches, clovers, lupins, etc.),—to\r\nobtain their supply of nitrogen from the air independently of those\r\ncontained in the soil. The source of nitrogen to plants was long a\r\ndisputed question; it was at first supposed (by de Saussure) that it\r\nwas obtained directly from the soil by the absorption of humus; but\r\nthis was disproved, and Liebig then contended that it was derived\r\ndirectly from the atmosphere through the ammonia in rain water. This\r\nwas then shown to be wholly inadequate; and Boussingault proved\r\nconclusively that plants do not take up nitrogen gas from the air.\r\nThis was subsequently denied by Ville; but investigation at the\r\nRothamstead agricultural station by Lawes and Gilbert definitely\r\nconfirmed Boussingault’s results. At the same time they also proved\r\nvery definitely that while grass and root crops deplete the soil\r\nof nitrogen, clover and other leguminous crops leave in the soil\r\nmore nitrogen than was previously present, even when the entire,\r\nitself highly nitrogenous, leguminous crop is removed from the land.\r\nThe improvement of lands for wheat production by rotation with\r\nclover had long ago become a practical maxim; but the cause was not\r\nunderstood until, in 1888, Hellriegel and Wilfarth announced that the\r\nvariously-shaped excrescences or tubercles which had long been observed\r\nas frequently deforming the roots of legumes, are caused by the attacks\r\nof bacilli capable of absorbing the free nitrogen of the air and thus\r\nenabling the host-plant to acquire its needed supply by absorbing\r\nthe richly nitrogenous matter thus accumulated in the excrescences.\r\nThe minute rod-shaped organism was named _Bacillus radicicola_ by\r\nBeyerinck; _Rhizobium leguminosarum_, by A. Frank, who has published an\r\nextensive treatise on the subject.[57]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21.—Microscopic section of cell tissue, from a\r\nnodule of Square-pod pea, showing cells filled with Rhizobia.[58]]\r\n\r\n[57] Uber die Pilzsymbcose der Leguminosen, Berlin, 1890.\r\n\r\n[58] Original figure from drawing by O. Butler, Asst. in Agr. Dep’t\r\nUniv. of California.\r\n\r\nMicroscopic examination of the nodules shows their tissues to contain\r\npartly motile, free bacteria, partly others (bacteroids), which have\r\nassumed a quiescent condition, and are of much greater dimensions\r\nthan those of the motile form. These relatively thick, and sometimes\r\nforked, forms, differing somewhat in each of the group adaptations\r\nmentioned below, constitute the bulk of the cell-contents of the\r\nnodules, and ultimately serve for the nutrition of the host-plant\r\nwith nitrogen. When the growth of the excrescence is completed, the\r\nswollen, quiescent bacteroids gradually collapse and become depleted\r\nof their nitrogenous substance; and finally the apparently empty husk\r\nremains or drops off, carrying with it the minute cocci which in the\r\nsoil become active bacteria again. The nodules are thus found mainly\r\non the actively-growing roots, and at the time when vegetation and\r\nassimilation are most active in the plant. In autumn, or when the\r\nplants are in fruit, the roots may be wholly destitute of nodules.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.—Square-pod pea.—Tetragonolobus purpureus. FIG.\r\n26.—White Lupin.—Lupinus albus.]\r\n\r\nThe adhesion of the nodules to the roots is mostly very loose, and\r\ntheir falling-off when the seedlings are carelessly transplanted,\r\ndoubtless accounts for much of the difficulty generally found in\r\ntransplanting legumes when once established.\r\n\r\nThe figures annexed show the various forms assumed by the nodules\r\nin different plants, and with them also the corresponding forms of\r\nthe bacteroids of each. The latter, here shown magnified about 1000\r\ntimes, are taken from the inaugural dissertation of D. Brock on this\r\nsubject, published at Leipzig in 1891. It appears that the forms of the\r\nbacteroids are quite as much varied as are those of the nodules they\r\nform.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.—Common Vetch.—Vicia sativa.\r\n\r\nFIG. 23.—Bur clover.—Medicago denticulata.\r\n\r\nFIG. 24.—Garden pea.—Pisum sativum.]\r\n\r\n_Varieties of Forms._—While these bacilli seem to be normally present\r\nin most soils, it seems to be necessary that they should adapt\r\nthemselves for this symbiosis[59] with each of several groups of the\r\nlegumes in order to exert their most beneficial effects. In many\r\nsoils there appears to exist a “neutral form”, which requires about\r\na season’s time or more to adapt itself specially to the several\r\nleguminous groups so that a great advantage is gained by infecting\r\neither the seeds or the soil with the forms already adapted, when no\r\nsimilar plant has lately occupied the same ground. Thus the bacillus of\r\nthe clover root is of little or no benefit to beans, peas or alfalfa,\r\nand the root-bacilli of each of the latter are relatively ineffectual\r\nwhen used to infect either of the other groups. The same is true of the\r\nbacilli of lupins and of acacias, as applied to leguminous plants of\r\nany other groups.[60]\r\n\r\n[59] “Living together” beneficially; in contradistinction to\r\nparasitism, which is injurious to the host plant.\r\n\r\n[60] It is asserted by some observers that the root-bacilli producing\r\ndifferently-shaped excrescences upon different legumes are distinct\r\nspecies; but this view is not sustained by the experiments of Nobbe and\r\nHiltner, and seems intrinsically improbable.\r\n\r\n_Mode of Infection._—The infection is especially effectual when applied\r\nto the seeds before sowing; and for that purpose there may be used\r\neither the turbid water made by stirring up in it some earth of a\r\nproperly infected field, or else water charged with a pure culture of\r\nthe appropriate kind, commercially known under the name of nitragin,\r\nnow manufactured for the purpose. Or else, the field to be sown may be\r\ninfected by spreading on it broadcast, _and promptly harrowing in_, a\r\nwagon-load of earth per acre from a properly infected field. Such earth\r\nmust not be allowed to dry, or to be long exposed to light.\r\n\r\n    Specially effective (“virulent”) and hardy forms of such\r\n    bacteria have been produced under artificial culture by Dr.\r\n    Geo. T. Moore of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. These\r\n    cultures can be sent by mail on cotton imbued with them, for\r\n    the infection of seeds.\r\n\r\nIt is very important that the bacillus should be present in the\r\n_earliest_ stages of the growth of the seedlings; otherwise the latter\r\nwill undergo a longer or shorter period of starvation, unless the soil\r\ncontains, or is furnished with, a sufficiency of available nitrogen\r\nto supply their immediate wants. When such a supply is very abundant,\r\nthe legume crop will sometimes develop no nodules at all; but the best\r\ncrops appear to be the result of a thorough infection, and abundant\r\nformation of the excrescences.\r\n\r\n_Cultural Results._—The marked results obtained in certain soils by\r\ninoculation with the legume-root bacillus are exemplified in the\r\nfollowing table, showing results of experiments by J. F. Duggar, at the\r\nAlabama Experiment station.[61]\r\n\r\n       TABLE SHOWING INCREASE OF PRODUCTION BY SOIL INOCULATION.\r\n    ==============================+=======+========+================\r\n              PER ACRE.           | TOPS. | ROOTS. |   NITROGEN.\r\n                                  | lbs.  |  lbs.  |  lbs. | Value.\r\n    ------------------------------+-------+--------+-------+--------\r\n    Hairy vetch, not inoculated   |   194 |   387  |   7   | $ 1.05\r\n      “     “   inoculated        |  3045 |  1452  | 106   |  15.90\r\n    Crimson clover not inoculated |   106 |   266  |   4.3 |    .65\r\n      “        “   inoculated     |  4840 |  1452  | 143.7 |  21.25\r\n    ------------------------------+-------+--------+-------+--------\r\n\r\n[61] Bull. Ala. Exp’t Station, No. 96, 1898.\r\n\r\nSuch marked _increases_ from soil inoculation cannot of course be\r\nexpected in cases where the soil has previously borne leguminous crops\r\nof similar nature and therefore already contains the root bacteria.\r\nHence Duggar found no increase of production when inoculating for\r\ncowpea, land that had borne that crop two years before and already\r\ncontained the root bacteria. In the arid region, where the almost\r\nuniversally calcareous soils usually bear a natural growth largely\r\ncomposed of various leguminous plants, inoculation is likely to be less\r\ncommonly effective than in the humid region east of the Mississippi,\r\nwhere leguminous plants are much less generally present in the native\r\nflora.\r\n\r\nThe distinctive agricultural function of supplying nitrogen to the\r\nsoils on which they grow, renders inexcusable the persistence of some\r\nwriters and teachers in designating all forage plants as “grasses.”\r\nWhatever excuse there may have been for this practice so long as the\r\nnitrogen-gathering function of the legumes was unknown, disappears\r\nwith this discovery, and the misleading misnomer should be banished\r\nfrom agricultural publications and lectures, at the very least.\r\n\r\n_Other Nitrogen-Absorbing Bacteria._—An increase in the\r\nnitrogen-content of some soils, aside from the action of leguminous\r\nroot-bacteria, has long been observed. As already stated, this increase\r\nwas at first ascribed to certain green algæ often seen to develop on\r\nthe soil surface; but it has now been shown that the nitrogen-gathering\r\nfunction belongs to at least two bacteria, one of which (_Clostridium\r\npastorianum_) was discovered by Winogradski, the other (_Azotobacter\r\nchroococcum_) by Beyerinck, and has since been farther investigated by\r\nKoch, Kröber, Gerlach and Vogel, and last by Lipman and Hugo Fischer.\r\nAccording to the latter it seems likely that Azotobacter chroococcum\r\nlives in symbiosis with the green algæ, all of which, like the\r\nAzotobacter itself, develop with special luxuriance on calcareous soils.\r\n\r\n    Lipman (Rep. Agr. Exp’t Station, New Jersey, 1903 and 1904)\r\n    describes as _Azotobacter vinelandii_ a form somewhat\r\n    different from the A. chroococcum, the nitrogen-assimilating\r\n    power of which he tested quite elaborately. He exposed to\r\n    air pure cultures of _A. vinelandii_ in nutritive\r\n    solution containing the proper mineral ingredients, and\r\n    glucose 20 grams per liter. 100 cub. centimeters of this\r\n    solution was exposed in flasks of respectively 250, 500\r\n    and 1000 cc. content, therefore having greater surface in\r\n    the larger flasks. After ten days, the amounts of nitrogen\r\n    fixed were found to be respectively 1.67, 3.19 and 7.90\r\n    milligrams. When mannite solution was employed instead of\r\n    glucose, a similar fixation was observed; and it was also\r\n    shown that the presence of combined nitrogen in the forms of\r\n    nitrates or ammonium salts discouraged the fixation by the\r\n    bacillus.\r\n\r\n    It was thus clearly proved that _A. vinelandii_ at\r\n    least does not need symbiosis with algæ to fix atmospheric\r\n    nitrogen; but experiments with mixed cultures of the above\r\n    bacillus and another (designated as No. 30 by Lipman) proved\r\n    that when these two co-operate the absorption of atmospheric\r\n    nitrogen is nearly doubled. As it is probable that this is\r\n    the case also with other soil bacteria, the importance of\r\n    this source of nitrogen to plants is obvious; provided of\r\n    course that the proper nutritive ingredients are present\r\n    in available form. Lipman shows that among the organic\r\n    nutrients, besides the sugars, glycerine and the salts of\r\n    propionic and lactic acids, and probably also others of the\r\n    same groups, can serve as nourishment to the nitrogen-fixing\r\n    bacteria.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION OF THE HUMUS WITHIN THE SURFACE SOIL.\r\n\r\nThe uniform distribution of the humus-contents of the surface soil, as\r\nshown in sections of the same, is by no means easily accounted for.\r\nThe roots from which its substance is so largely derived are not so\r\nuniversally distributed as to account for it; but least of all can the\r\nrapid disappearance of the leaf-fall and other vegetable offal from\r\nthe surface be accounted for without some outside agencies. Of these,\r\nthe action of fungous vegetation, and of insects and earthworms, are\r\ndoubtless the chief ones.\r\n\r\n_Fungi._—When we examine a decaying root, we find radiating from it\r\na zone of deeper tint, as though from a colored solution penetrating\r\noutward. But since under normal conditions humus is insoluble, this\r\nexplanation cannot stand. Microscopic examination, however, reveals\r\nthat the outside limit of this zone is also the limit to which the\r\nfungous fibrils concerned in the process extend; and as these fibrils\r\nare much more finely distributed and much more numerous than the\r\nroots of any plant, it is natural that the humus resulting from\r\ntheir decomposition should be more evenly distributed than the roots\r\nthemselves.[62]\r\n\r\n[62] Kosticheff, Formation and Properties of Humus; in abstract Jour.\r\nChem. Soc., 1891, p. 611.\r\n\r\nSuch fungous growth is not, however, confined to dead and decaying\r\nroots only. A large number of trees and shrubs, among them pines and\r\nfirs, beeches, aspen and many others, also the heaths, and woody plants\r\nassociated with them, appear to depend largely for their healthy\r\ndevelopment, notably in northern latitudes, upon the co-operation\r\n(“symbiosis”) of fungous fibrils that “infest” their roots, enabling\r\nthem to assimilate, indirectly, the decaying organic (and inorganic)\r\nmatter which would otherwise be unavailable, and at the same time\r\nconverting that matter into their own substance. Fungous growths thus\r\nmediate both the decomposition and rehabilitation of the vegetable\r\ndebris.\r\n\r\nThe vegetative fibrils (mycelia) of several kinds of molds are\r\nconstantly present in the soil, and while consuming the dead tissue\r\nof the higher plants, spread their own substance throughout the soil\r\nmass. The same is true of the subterranean or “root” mycelia of the\r\nlarger fungi, toadstools, mushrooms, which are commonly found about\r\ndead stumps and other deposits of decaying vegetable and animal offal.\r\nAll these being dependent upon the presence of air for their life\r\nfunctions, remain within such distance from the surface as will afford\r\nadequate aeration; the depth reached depending upon the perviousness of\r\nthe soil and subsoil. In the humid region this will usually be within\r\na foot of the surface, but in the arid may reach to several feet.\r\nUltimately these organisms contribute their substance to the store of\r\nhumus in the land.\r\n\r\n    On the surface of moist soils we frequently find a copious\r\n    growth of green fibrils, which may be either those of algæ,\r\n    such as Oscillaria, or the early stages (prothallia) of\r\n    moss vegetation. This vegetation has been credited with\r\n    absorption of nitrogen from the air, thus enriching the\r\n    soil; but later researches have shown this effect to be due\r\n    to symbiotic bacteria (see above p. 156).\r\n\r\n_Animal Agencies._—Darwin first suggested that wherever the common\r\nearthworm (_Lumbricus_) finds the conditions of existence, it exerts a\r\nmost important influence in the formation of the humous surface-soil\r\nlayer; and the limitation imposed upon these conditions by the\r\nsubsoil has doubtless a great deal to do with the sharp demarcation\r\nwe often find between it and the surface soil. Briefly stated, the\r\nearthworm nourishes itself by swallowing, successively, portions of\r\nthe surrounding earth, digesting a part of its organic matter and then\r\nejecting the undigested earth in the form of “casts,” such as may\r\nbe seen by thousands on the surface of the ground during or after a\r\nrain. Darwin (The Formation of Vegetable Mold, 1881), has calculated\r\nfrom actual observation that in humid climates and in a ground fairly\r\nstocked with these worms, the soil thus brought up may amount to from\r\none-tenth to two-tenths of an inch annually over the entire surface;\r\nso that in half a century the entire surface foot might have been\r\nthus worked over. Aside from the mechanical effect thus achieved in\r\nloosening the soil, and the access of air and water permitted by their\r\nburrows, the chemical effects resulting from their digestive process,\r\nand the final return of their own substance to the soil mass; also\r\ntheir habit of drawing after themselves into their burrows leafstalks,\r\nblades of grass and other vegetable remains, renders their work of no\r\nmean importance both from the physical and chemical point of view. The\r\nuniformity, lack of structure and loose texture of the surface soil,\r\nespecially of forests, as compared with subsoil layers of corresponding\r\nthickness, is doubtless largely due to the earthworms’ work. It has\r\nfrequently been observed that when an unusual overflow has drowned out\r\nthe earthworm population of a considerable area, the surface soil layer\r\nremains compacted, and vegetation languishes, until new immigration\r\nhas restocked the soil with them. Again, the humus formed under their\r\ninfluence is always neutral, never acid.\r\n\r\n    Wollny (Forsch, Agr., 1890, p. 382), has shown by\r\n    direct experimental cultures in boxes, with and without\r\n    earthworms, surprising differences between the cultural\r\n    results obtained, and this has been fully confirmed by the\r\n    subsequent researches of Djemil (Ber. Physiol. Lab. Vers.\r\n    Halle, 1898). In Wollny’s experiments, the ratio of higher\r\n    production in the presence of the worms, varied all the way\r\n    from 2.6 per cent in the case of oats, 93.9 in that of rye,\r\n    135.9 in that of potatoes, 300 in that of the field pea, and\r\n    140 in that of the vetch, to 733 per cent in the case of\r\n    rape. Wollny attributes these favorable effects in the main\r\n    to the increased looseness, and perviousness of the soil to\r\n    air, and diminished water-holding power. Djemil’s results\r\n    all point in the same direction; and he shows, moreover,\r\n    that the allegation that the roots penetrate more deeply in\r\n    the presence of the worms by following their burrows, is\r\n    unfounded, the descending roots often passing close to and\r\n    outside of these.\r\n\r\nThe work of earthworms is especially effective in loamy soils and in\r\nthe humid regions. In the arid region, and in sandy soils generally,\r\nthe life-conditions are unfavorable to the worm, and the perviousness\r\nelsewhere brought about by its labors already exists naturally in most\r\ncases. It is stated by E. T. Seton (Century Mag. for June, 1904) that\r\nthe earthworm is practically non-existent in the arid region between\r\nthe Rocky Mountains and the immediate Pacific coast, from Manitoba to\r\nTexas. In the Pacific coast region, however, they are abundant, and do\r\ntheir work effectually.\r\n\r\n_Insects_ of various kinds are also instrumental in producing, not only\r\nthe uniform distribution of humus in the surface soil, but also the\r\nlooseness of texture which we see in forest soils especially. Ants,\r\nwasps, many kinds of beetles, crickets, and particularly the larvæ\r\nof these, and of other burrowing creatures, often form considerable\r\naccumulations, due directly both to their mechanical activity, and to\r\ntheir excrements.\r\n\r\nThe work of _ants_ is in some regions on so large a scale as to attract\r\nthe attention of the most casual observer. Especially is this the case\r\nin portions of the arid region, from Texas to Montana, where at times\r\nlarge areas are so thickly studded with hills from three to twelve feet\r\nin diameter, and one to two feet high, that it is difficult to pass\r\nwithout being attacked by the insects. The “mounds” studding a large\r\nportion of the prairie country of Louisiana seem also to be due to the\r\nwork of ants, although not inhabited at present.\r\n\r\nLarger burrowing animals also assist in the task of mixing uniformly\r\nthe surface soils, and aiding root-penetration, as well as, in many\r\ncases, the conservation of moisture. Seton (loc. cit.) even claims that\r\nthe pocket gophers (Thomomys) in a great degree replace the activity of\r\nthe earthworms in the arid region, where they, together with the voles\r\n(commonly known there as field mice), exist in great numbers. Of course\r\nthe work of these animals, as well as that of the prairie dogs, ground\r\nsquirrels, badgers, etc., is incompatible with cultivation. But the\r\neffects of their burrows on the native vegetation, and the indications\r\nthey give of the nature of the subsoil, are eminently useful to the\r\nland-seeker.\r\n\r\n    Thus in the rolling sediment-lands of the Great Bend of\r\n    the Columbia, the observer is surprised to see the “giant\r\n    rye grass,” usually at home in the moist lowlands, growing\r\n    preferably on the crests of the ridges bordering the\r\n    horizon. Examination shows that this is due to the burrowing\r\n    of badgers, whereby the roots of the grass are enabled to\r\n    reach moisture at all times, even in that extremely arid\r\n    region.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nSOIL AND SUBSOIL (_Continued_)\r\n\r\nTHEIR RELATIONS TO VEGETATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Physical Effects of the Percolation of Surface Waters._—The muddy\r\nwater formed by the beating of rains on the soil surface will, in\r\npenetrating the soil, carry with it the diffused colloidal clay to a\r\ncertain depth into the subsoil. We should therefore expect that as\r\na rule every subsoil will be more clayey than its surface soil; and\r\nthis is found to be almost universally the case in the humid region.\r\nSubsoils are therefore almost always less precious and more retentive\r\nof moisture, as well as of plant-food substances in solution, than\r\ntheir surface soils, unless these are very rich in humus; and as the\r\nfinest particles are usually those richest in available plant-food,\r\nit follows that subsoils will as a rule be found to contain larger\r\nsupplies of the latter than the surface soil. Common experience as well\r\nas comparative analysis confirm both of these inferences so thoroughly,\r\nthat it becomes unnecessary to adduce examples in this place.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the reverse, upward movement of moisture caused\r\nby surface evaporation tends constantly to bring any soluble salts\r\ncontained in the soil mass nearer to the surface, thus increasing the\r\nstock of easily available plant-food in the surface soil. In extreme\r\ncases, especially in the arid region, this accumulation of salts may\r\nbecome excessive, and seriously injurious to plant growth. (See “Alkali\r\nSoils”, chapters 21, 22.)\r\n\r\n_Chemical effects of Water-Percolation._—The accumulation of plant-food\r\nin the subsoil is not, however, due only to the mechanically-carried\r\nparticles, but also to the ingredients carried in solution from the\r\nsurface soil and redeposited in the more retentive subsoils. Especially\r\nis this true of _lime carbonate_, which is dissolved by the carbonic\r\nacid formed chiefly within the humic surface soil, and is often carried\r\noff in amounts sufficient to obstruct drain tiles by its deposition\r\nin contact with air (see chapt. 3). In the case of moderate rains,\r\nhowever, it is carried no farther than the subsoil, and is there\r\nredeposited, in consequence of the penetration of air, following the\r\nwater, and causing the carbonic gas to diffuse upward; thus leaving the\r\nlime carbonate behind. In the majority of cases this results simply in\r\na gradual enriching of the subsoil in this substance; while the surface\r\nsoil may become so depleted as to require its artificial replacement by\r\nliming or marling. The same general process occurs to a less extent, in\r\nthe case of magnesia.\r\n\r\n_Calcareous Subsoils._—The fact that subsoils are more calcareous than\r\nthe corresponding surface soils is often of great practical importance,\r\nin enabling the farmer to enrich his depleted surface soil in lime by\r\nsubsoil plowing. The accumulation of lime carbonate in the subsoil also\r\ntends in a measure to offset the extreme heaviness sometimes resulting\r\nfrom the accumulation of clay.\r\n\r\n_Calcareous Subsoils and Hardpans._—When soils are very rich in lime,\r\nand rains occur in limited showers rather than continuously, the\r\nlime carbonate dissolved from the surface soil may accumulate in the\r\nsubsoil so as to either form calcareous “hardpan” by the cementing of\r\nthe subsoil mass; or it may accumulate and partly crystallize around\r\ncertain centers and thus form white concretions, known to farmers as\r\n“white gravel.” The latter is the form usually assumed in the regions\r\nof summer rains; while in the arid regions the deficient rainfall\r\ncauses this substance to accumulate, and calcareous hardpan to form, at\r\ndefinite depths depending upon the maximum penetration of the annual\r\nrainfall; sometimes in crystalline masses of veritable limestone\r\n(“kankar” of India), or sometimes merely as crystalline incrustations\r\nloosely cementing the subsoil.\r\n\r\n_“Rawness” of Subsoils in Humid Climates._—From the greater compactness\r\nof the subsoil which is almost universal in the humid regions, the\r\nabsence of humus and of the resulting formation of carbonic and humic\r\nacids, it follows that its minerals are less subject to the weathering\r\nprocess than are those of the surface soil. In the farmer’s parlance,\r\nthe subsoil is “raw” as compared with the surface soil; it is not so\r\nsuitable for plant-nutrition, and therefore must not be brought to the\r\nsurface to form the seed-bed, or be incorporated with the surface soil\r\nto any considerable extent _at any one time_, if crop-nutrition is to\r\nbe normal. It is only in the course of time, by exposure to atmospheric\r\naction as well as to that of the humus, and of plant roots, that it\r\nbecomes properly adapted to perform the functions of the surface soil.\r\n\r\n_Soils and Subsoils in the Arid Region._—But however pronounced and\r\nimportant are these distinctions and differences in the humid region,\r\nthey are found to be profoundly modified in the arid; where, as before\r\nstated, the formation of colloidal clay is very much diminished,\r\nso that most soils formed under arid conditions are of a sandy or\r\npulverulent type. There is then little or no clay to be washed down\r\ninto the subsoil, hence there is no compacting of the latter; the air\r\nconsequently circulates freely down to the depth of many feet.\r\n\r\nThus one of the most important distinctions between soil and subsoil\r\nis to a great extent practically non-existent in the arid region, at\r\nleast within the depths to which tillage can be made to reach; so that\r\nthe limitations attached to subsoil-plowing in the countries of summer\r\nrains do not apply to the characteristic soils of the arid regions.\r\n\r\nEven the distinction in regard to humus is here largely obliterated\r\nby the circumstance, already alluded to, that most of that substance\r\nmust, in the arid regions, be derived from the decay of roots, which\r\nmoreover reach to much greater depth in these soils. Hence even in the\r\nuplands of the arid region it is common to find no change of tint from\r\nthe surface down to three feet, and even more. This, like the free\r\ncirculation of the air in consequence of porosity, tends to render the\r\ndistinction of soil and subsoil practically useless; since it disposes\r\nof the objection to “subsoiling” based upon the inert condition of the\r\nsubsoil, which in humid climates so effectually interferes with the\r\nwelfare of crops unless subsoiling is restricted to a fraction of an\r\ninch at a time.\r\n\r\nThese fundamental differences in the soils of the two regions are\r\nillustrated schematically in the subjoined diagram, which shows on the\r\nleft the contrast between clay or clay loam soils, in which the depth\r\nof the surface soil-sample to be taken is prescribed as nine inches by\r\nthe rules of the Association of Am. Official Chemists (in the writer’s\r\nexperience it is more nearly six inches as a rule). Alongside of the\r\nEastern soil thus characterized is placed a typical “adobe” soil from\r\nthe grounds of the California Experiment station, of which a sample\r\nshowing uniform blackness to three feet depth was exhibited at the\r\nWorld’s Fair at Chicago in 1893. At the right is a profile of the noted\r\nhop soil on the bench lands of the Russian river, Cal., in which the\r\nhumus-content was determined down to twelve feet, the humus-percentage\r\nbeing .44% at that depth against 1.21% in the surface foot (see chapt.\r\n8, p. 139). In this and similar soils the roots of hops reach down to\r\nas much as fourteen feet without much lateral expansion; as shown in\r\nplate No. 31 of this chapter. Similar conditions prevail in the sandy\r\nuplands, as, _e. g._, in the wheat lands of Stanislaus county, Cal.,\r\nmentioned above.\r\n\r\nTaking the clay soils as a fair type for comparison, it would seem that\r\nthe farmer in the arid region owns from three to four farms, one above\r\nanother, as compared with the same acreage in the Eastern states.\r\n\r\n_Subsoils and Deep-plowing in the Arid Region._—Up to the present time\r\nthis advantage is but little appreciated and acted upon by the farmers\r\nof the arid region. They still instinctively cling to the practice\r\ntaught them by their fathers, and which is still promulgated as the\r\nonly correct practice, in most books on agriculture. There are of\r\ncourse in the arid as well as in the humid region, cases in which deep\r\nplowing is inadvisable; viz, that of marsh or swamp lands, as well as\r\nsometimes in very sandy, porous soils, the cultural value of which\r\noften depends essentially upon the presence of a somewhat consolidated,\r\nand more retentive subsoil, which should not be broken up. But in most\r\nsoils not of extreme physical character, it is in the arid region not\r\nonly permissible, but eminently advisable to plow, for preparation, as\r\ndeeply as circumstances permit, in order to facilitate the penetration\r\nof the roots beyond the reach of harm from the summer’s drought; while\r\nfor the same reason, subsequent cultivation should be to a moderate\r\ndepth only, for the better conservation of moisture, and the formation\r\nof a protective surface mulch (see chapter 13).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n       |TYPE OF EASTERN SOILS|  TYPES OF CALIFORNIA SOILS.\r\n    ---+---------------------+--------------------+-----------\r\n    Ft.|       Upland.       | Up land clay-loam. | Beach land.\r\n    ---+---------------------+--------------------+-----------\r\n\r\nFIG. 27.—Soil Profiles illustrating differences in Soils of Humid and\r\nArid Region.]\r\n\r\nIt must not be forgotten that there are in the lowlands of the arid\r\nregion (river swamps or tules, sea-coast marshes, etc.,) soils in which\r\nsurface soil and subsoil are differentiated as fully as in the humid\r\ncountries; at least so long as they have not been fully drained for a\r\nconsiderable length of time. In swamp areas that have been elevated\r\nabove the reach of overflow or shallow bottom-water by geological\r\nagencies, even the heavy swamp clays are fully aerated down to great\r\ndepths, and roots penetrate accordingly.\r\n\r\n_Examples of Plant-growth on Arid Subsoils._—The fact that in the arid\r\nregion the surface-soil conditions reach to so much greater depths\r\nthan in the East and in Europe, is so important for farming practice\r\nin that region that experimental evidence of the same should not be\r\nwithheld. Of such, some cases well established as typical of California\r\nexperience are therefore cited.\r\n\r\n    It is well known that in the Sierra Nevada of California\r\n    the placer mines of the Foothills, worked in the early\r\n    times, have long disappeared from sight, having been quickly\r\n    covered by a growth of the bull pine (_P. ponderosa_).\r\n    Much of this timber growth has for a number of years past\r\n    been of sufficient size to be used for timbering in mines,\r\n    and a second young forest is springing up on what was\r\n    originally the red earth of the placer mines, which appears\r\n    to the eye as hopelessly barren as the sands of the desert.\r\n    In this same red sandy earth not unfrequently cellars and\r\n    house foundations are dug, and the material removed, even to\r\n    the depth of eight feet, is fearlessly put on the garden and\r\n    there serves as a new soil, on which vegetables and small\r\n    fruits grow, the first year, as well as ever. In preparing\r\n    such land for irrigation by leveling or terracing no heed is\r\n    taken of the surface soil as against the subsoil, even where\r\n    the latter must be removed to the depth of several feet, so\r\n    long as a sufficient depth of soil material remains above\r\n    the bedrock.\r\n\r\n    The same is generally true of the benchlands; the irrigator\r\n    levels, slopes or terraces his land for irrigation with\r\n    no thought of discrimination between soil and subsoil,\r\n    and the cultural result as a rule justifies his apparent\r\n    carelessness. It is only where from special causes a\r\n    consolidated or hardpan subsoil is brought to the surface,\r\n    that the land when leveled shows “spotted” crops. Such\r\n    is the case in some of the “hog-wallow” areas of the San\r\n    Joaquin valley of California, and in some cases where by\r\n    long cultivation and plowing to the same depth, a compact\r\n    soil-layer or plowsole has been formed, and the land is\r\n    then leveled for the introduction of irrigation. In these\r\n    cases a section of the soil mass will usually show a marked\r\n    difference in color and texture. But, as a rule, in taking\r\n    soil samples, no noticeable difference can be perceived\r\n    between the first and the second, and oftentimes as far\r\n    down as the third and fourth foot. The extraordinary\r\n    root-penetration of trees, shrubs and taprooted herbs, whose\r\n    fibrous feeding-roots are found deep in the subsoil and\r\n    are sometimes wholly absent from the surface soil, fully\r\n    corroborate the conclusion reached by the eye. The roots\r\n    of grape vines have been found by the writer at the depth\r\n    of twenty-two feet below the surface, in a gravelly clay\r\n    loam varying but little the entire distance. In a similarly\r\n    uniform and pervious material, the loess of Nebraska,\r\n    Aughey[63] reports the roots of the native Shepherdia to have\r\n    been found at the depth of fifty feet.\r\n\r\n[63] See Merrill, Rocks and Rock weathering.\r\n\r\n_Resistance to Drought._—These peculiarities of the soils of the arid\r\nregion explain without any resort to violent hypotheses, the fact\r\nthat many culture plants which in the regions of summer rains are\r\nfound to be dependent upon frequent and abundant rainfall, will in\r\nCalifornia, and in the country west of the Rocky Mountains generally,\r\nthrive and complete their growth and fruiting during periods of four\r\nto six months of practically absolute cessation of rainfall; when east\r\nof the Mississippi a similar cessation for as many _weeks_ will ruin\r\nthe crops, if not kill the plants. In continental Europe, in 1892,\r\na six weeks’ drought caused almost all the fruit crops to drop from\r\nthe trees, and many trees failed to revive the next season; while at\r\nthe very same time, the same deciduous fruits gave a bountiful crop\r\nin California, during the prevalence of the usual five or six months’\r\ndrought. This was without irrigation, or any aid beyond careful and\r\nthorough surface tillage following the cessation of rains in April\r\nor May, so as to leave the soil to the depth of five or six inches\r\nin a condition of looseness perfectly adapted to the prevention of\r\nevaporation from the moist subsoil, and of the conduction of the\r\nexcessive heat of the summer sun. This surface mulch will contain\r\npractically no feeding-roots, the paralysis or death of which by heat\r\nand drought would influence sensibly the welfare of the growing plant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28.—Root of an Eastern (Wisconsin) Fruit Tree.\r\n(Photograph by Prof F. H. King.)]\r\n\r\n_Root-system in the Humid Region._—It is quite otherwise where a dense\r\nsubsoil not only obstructs mechanically the deep penetration of any\r\nbut the strongest roots, but at the same time is itself too inert\r\nto provide sufficiently abundant nourishment apart from the surface\r\nsoil, which is there the portion containing, alongside of humus, the\r\nbulk of the available plant-food, and in which alone the processes of\r\nabsorption and nutrition find the proper conditions; such as access\r\nof air and the ready and minute penetration of even the most delicate\r\nrootlets and root-hairs. The largest and most active portion of the\r\nroot-system being thus accumulated in the surface soil, it follows\r\nthat unless the latter is constantly kept in a fair condition of\r\nmoistness, the plant must suffer material injury very quickly; hence\r\nthe often fatal effects of even a few weeks’ drought. The same occurs\r\nin the arid region when often-repeated shallow plowing has resulted in\r\nthe formation of a “plowsole” which prevents the deep penetration of\r\nroots; when a hot “norther” will often in a short time not only dry the\r\nplowed soil, but will heat it to such extent as to actually bake the\r\nroots it harbors. Under the same weather-conditions an adjoining field,\r\nproperly plowed, may almost wholly escape injury.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29.—Prune Tree on Peach Root, at Niles, Cal.]\r\n\r\n_Comparison of root development in the arid and humid regions._—Figures\r\n28, 29 given here show the differences as actually seen in the case of\r\nfruit trees as grown in Wisconsin and California, respectively, both in\r\nthe absence of artificial water-supply.\r\n\r\n_Adaptation of humid species to arid conditions._—Figures, in No. 30,\r\nshow the root systems respectively of the riverside grape (_Vitis\r\nriparia_) as grown in the Mississippi Valley states, and the natural\r\ndevelopment as found in the Rock grape of Missouri and also in the wild\r\ngrape vine of California. It will be noted at once that the latter\r\ndirects its cord-like roots almost vertically from the first, until\r\nit reaches a depth varying from 12 to 18 inches, where it begins to\r\nbranch more freely, but still with a strong downward tendency in all.\r\nThe roots of the riverside grape, on the contrary, tend to spread\r\nalmost horizontally, branching freely at the depth of a few inches and\r\nmanifestly deriving its supply both of plant-food and moisture mainly\r\nfrom the surface soil. It is curious to observe the behavior of this\r\nvine when cuttings are planted in California vineyards as a resistant\r\ngrafting-stock. Its first roots are sent out horizontally, very much as\r\nis its habit in the East, so long as the soil moisture is maintained\r\nnear the surface. But as the season advances, the more superficial\r\nrootlets are first thrown out of action by the advancing dryness and\r\nheat of the surface soil, and many finally die the first year.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30.—Root Growth of Resistant Grape Vines.]\r\n\r\nNot unfrequently the entire root system developed by the uppermost bud\r\nperishes; but usually its main roots soon begin to recede from the\r\nthreatening drought and heat of the surface, curving, or branching\r\ndownward in the direction of the moisture supply, and without detriment\r\nto their nutrition because of the practical identity of the surface\r\nsoil and subsoil. As the portions of the roots near the surface thicken\r\nand mature, their corky rind soon prevents their being injured by the\r\narid conditions to which they are subjected; while the root-ends,\r\nfinding congenial conditions of nutriment and aeration in the moist\r\ndepths, develop without difficulty as they would in their humid home.\r\nPractically the same process of adaptation takes place in every one of\r\nthe trees, shrubs, or perennials belonging to the humid climates, until\r\ntheir root system has assumed nearly the habit of the corresponding\r\nnative vegetation.\r\n\r\nThe photograph of the roots of a hop plant, grown on bench lands of the\r\nSacramento river, shows the roots extending to 8 feet depth, but where\r\nbroken off the main root is still nearly two millimeters in thickness,\r\nproving that it penetrated at least two feet beyond the depth shown in\r\nfigure 31.\r\n\r\nIn the case of native annuals, either the duration of their vegetation\r\nis extremely short, ending with or shortly after the cessation of\r\nrains; or else their tap roots descend so low, and the nutritive\r\nrootlets are developed at such depth, as to be beyond reach of the\r\nsummer’s heat and drought. For while it is true that rootlets immersed\r\nin air-dry soil may absorb plant-food, this absorption is very slow\r\nand can only be auxiliary to the main root system which, instead of\r\nterminating in the surface soil as in the humid region, will be found\r\nto begin to branch off at depths of 15 and 18 inches, and may then in\r\nsandy lands descend to from 4 to 7 feet even in the case of annual\r\nfibrous-rooted plants like wheat and barley.[64] In the case of maize\r\nthe roots of a late-planted crop may sometimes be found descending\r\nalong the walls of the sun-cracks in heavy clay land poorly cultivated;\r\nand it frequently matures a crop without the aid of a single shower\r\nafter planting. See figures 33, 34.\r\n\r\n[64] Shaler (Origin and Nature of Soils; 12th Rept. U. S. Geol.\r\nSurvey, p. 311) says: “Annual plants cannot in their brief period of\r\ngrowth push their roots more than six to twelve inches below their\r\nroot-crowns”—a generalization measurably true for the humid region\r\nonly. According to F. J. Alway, the roots of cereals penetrate to 5-7\r\nfeet in Saskatchewan, also.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31.—Hop Root from Sacramento Bench-land.]\r\n\r\nThe annexed plate (No. 32) shows the main roots of two native perennial\r\nweeds of California, the goosefoot (_Chenopodium californicum_) and the\r\nfigwort (_Scrophularia californica_), common on the lower slopes of the\r\ncoast ranges. The soil was a heavy clay loam or “black adobe” resulting\r\nfrom the weathering of the clay shale bedrock, fragments of which are\r\nso abundantly intermixed with the substrata that excavation of the\r\nroots became very difficult. Yet the main root of the goosefoot went\r\ndown below the depth of eleven feet.\r\n\r\nThe main root of the figwort, also, was followed below the depth of ten\r\nfeet without reaching the extreme end. This proves clearly that the\r\ngreat penetration of the goosefoot was not, as might be supposed, due\r\nto its bulbous root. Yet such thickening of the root just below the\r\ncrown is a rather common feature in arid-region plants, and can here be\r\nnoted even in the figwort, within whose botanical relationship bulbous\r\nroots are almost unknown.\r\n\r\nAny one accustomed to the cornfields of the Middle West, where in the\r\nafter-cultivation of maize it is necessary to restrict very carefully\r\nthe depth of tillage to avoid bringing up a mat of white, fibrous\r\nroots, will be at once impressed with the remarkable adaptability of\r\nmaize to different climatic conditions, as exhibited in such cases and\r\nshown in figures 33, 34. In southern California, in the deep mesa or\r\nbench soils, corn stalks so tall that a man standing on horseback can\r\nbarely reach the tassel, and with two or three large ears, are quite\r\ncommonly grown under similar rainfall-conditions.\r\n\r\n_Importance of proper Substrata in the Arid Region._—The paramount need\r\nof deep penetration of roots in the arid region renders the substrata\r\nbelow the range of what is usually understood by subsoil in the humid\r\nclimates, of exceptional importance. A good farmer anywhere will\r\nexamine the subsoil to the depth of two feet before investing in land;\r\nbut more than this is necessary in the arid region, where the surface\r\nsoil is often almost thrown out of action during the greater part of\r\nthe growing season, while the needful moisture and nourishment must be\r\nwholly drawn from the subsoil and substrata; an examination of which\r\nshould therefore precede every purchase of land, or planting of crops.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32.—Deep-Rooting of Native California Goosefoot and\r\nFigwort.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 33.—Kentucky Maize, grown in region of Summer\r\nRains. (Photography by A. M. Peter.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34.—California Maize, Grown Without Rain or\r\nIrrigation.]\r\n\r\n    Such examinations are most quickly made by means of a probe\r\n    consisting of a pointed, square steel rod five or six feet\r\n    long, provided at one end with a loop for the insertion of\r\n    a cross-handle like that of a carpenter’s auger. The handle\r\n    being grasped with both hands, the probe is forced into the\r\n    soil with a slight reciprocating motion, by the weight of\r\n    the operator; who soon learns how to interpret the varying\r\n    kinds of resistance, and on withdrawing the probe carefully\r\n    will generally be able to determine if bottom water has\r\n    been reached. Should this easy method of examination not\r\n    convey all the needful information, the post-hole auger may\r\n    be resorted to; and it is desirable that extra (three-foot)\r\n    rods or gaspipe joints be provided for the purpose of\r\n    lengthening the probe or auger, when necessary, to nine\r\n    or twelve feet. It will rarely be necessary to go to the\r\n    trouble of digging a pit for such examinations; but even\r\n    this is to be recommended rather than “buying a cat in a\r\n    bag” in the guise of an unexplored subsoil.\r\n\r\n_Faulty Substrata._—A number of examples of “faulty lands,” _i. e._,\r\nsuch as are underlaid by faulty substrata, are given in the annexed\r\ndiagram Fig. 35; the examples being taken from California localities\r\nbecause of their having been most thoroughly investigated. Similar\r\ncases, as well as others not here illustrated, of course occur more or\r\nless all over the world.\r\n\r\nNo. 1 shows a case which, though at first sight an aggravated one of a\r\nrocky substratum, is in reality that of some of the best fruit lands\r\nin the State. The limited surface-soil is very rich, and is directly\r\nderived (as a “sedentary” soil) from the underlying bedrock slate.\r\nBut this it will be noted stands _on edge_, and the roots of trees\r\nand vines wedge their way along the cleavage planes of the slate to\r\nconsiderable depth, deriving from them both nourishment and moisture.\r\nUnder similar conditions the California laurel, usually found on the\r\nbanks of streams, grows on the summits of rocky ridges in the Coast\r\nRanges.\r\n\r\nThe case of No. 2 is quite otherwise. Here the shale lies horizontally,\r\nand though much softer than the slate of the first column, obstinately\r\nresists the penetration of roots; so that the land, though fairly\r\nprovided with plant-food, is almost wholly useless for cultivation. It\r\nis naturally covered with low, stunted shrubs or chaparral; only here\r\nand there, where a cleft has been caused by earthquakes or subsidence,\r\na large pine tree indicates that nourishment and moisture exists within\r\nthe refractory clay stratum, and suggests blasting as a means of\r\nrendering the land fit for trees at least.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FAULTY LANDS. CALIFORNIA\r\n\r\nFIG. 35.—Faulty Lands, California.]\r\n\r\nNo. 3 is a case similar to that of No. 2, only there is here a dense\r\nunstratified mass of red clay, of good native fertility. It is here\r\nthat the expedient of blasting the tree holes with dynamite was first\r\nsuccessfully employed, in central California. For lack of this,\r\nextensive tracts of similar land in southern California, planted to\r\norchards, have completely failed of useful results after three years of\r\nculture.\r\n\r\nNo. 4 shows a typical case of calcareous hardpan obstructing the\r\npenetration of roots, even though usually interrupted at intervals,\r\nbecause of the formation occurring mostly in swales, along which\r\nthe sheets lie more or less continuously. Here also, blasting will\r\ngenerally permit the successful growth of trees and vines, whose roots\r\nfrequently will, in time, wholly disintegrate the hardpan and thus\r\nrender the land fit for field cultures. The depth at which such hardpan\r\nis formed usually depends upon the depth to which the annual rainfall\r\npenetrates. (See below, page 183).\r\n\r\nNos. 4, 5, and 6 all illustrate cases of intrinsically fertile, very\r\ndeep soils, shallowed by obstructions which in the case of No. 4 are\r\nhardpan sheets, while in No. 5 the intervention of bottom water limits\r\nroot penetration, hence restricts the use of the land to relatively\r\nshallow-rooted crops, and the use of only a few feet of the profusely\r\nfertile soil. Such is the case where bottom water has been allowed to\r\nrise too high, through the use of leaky irrigation ditches.\r\n\r\nNo. 6 illustrates a case not uncommon in sedimentary lands, where\r\nbottom water is quite within reach of most plants, but is prevented\r\nfrom being utilized by the intervention of layers of coarse sand or\r\ngravel, through which the water will not rise; and the roots, while\r\nthey would be able to penetrate, are not near enough to feel the\r\npresence of water underneath and therefore spread on the surface of\r\nthe gravel, suffering from drought within easy reach of abundance of\r\nwater. The “going-back” of large portions of orange orchards in the\r\nSan Bernardino Valley of California has been thus brought about; and\r\nunfortunately this state of things is almost beyond the possibility of\r\nremedy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 36.—Almond Tree on Hardpan. Paso Robles Substation,\r\nCal.]\r\n\r\n_Injury from Impervious Substrata._—The injurious effects of a\r\ndifficultly penetrable subsoil have already been discussed and are\r\nself-evident. When the substratum is a dense clay, the rise of moisture\r\nfrom below being very slow, it can easily happen that the roots cannot\r\npenetrate deep enough in time for the coming of the dry season, and\r\nthat thus the crop will suffer. The case will be still worse when\r\nhardpan cemented by lime or silex limits root-penetration, as well as\r\nproper drainage. In such cases the culture of field crops often becomes\r\nimpracticable, even with irrigation, as its frequent repetition,\r\nbesides being costly, can rarely be commanded. In the case of trees,\r\nthe limitation of root-penetration results in the spreading-out of the\r\nroots on the surface of the impenetrable layer; as shown in figure 36,\r\nwhich exhibits a root-development that would be quite normal in the\r\nregions of summer rains, but is wholly abnormal in the arid region, and\r\nresults in the unprofitableness or death of the trees. It has often\r\nbeen attempted in such cases to plant trees in large holes dug deep\r\ninto the subsoil and refilled with surface earth and manure. All such\r\nattempts result in failure, if only because the excavation inevitably\r\nfills with water, which will soak away but very slowly into the dense\r\nsubstrata, and will thus injure or drown out the roots. Besides, the\r\nlatter will remain bunched in the loose earth, and will thus be unable\r\nto draw either moisture or nourishment from the surrounding land. It\r\nis absolutely necessary to remedy this by loosening the substrata, if\r\nsuccess is to be attained.\r\n\r\n_Shattering of Dense Substrata by Dynamite._—The permanent loosening\r\nof dense substrata is best accomplished by moderate charges (½ to\r\n¾ pounds) of “No. 2” dynamite at a sufficient depth (3 to 5 feet).\r\nThe shattering effect of the explosive will be sensible to the depth\r\nof eight feet or more, and will fissure the clay or hardpan to a\r\ncorresponding extent sidewise. If properly proportioned the charge\r\nwill hardly disturb the surface; but if this be desired, from 1½ to\r\n2½ pounds of black powder placed above the dynamite will throw out\r\nsufficient earth to plant the tree without farther digging. Where labor\r\nis high-priced this proves the cheapest as well as the best way to\r\nprepare such ground for tree planting; and it has often been found that\r\nin the course of time, the loosening begun by the powder has extended\r\nthrough the mass of the land so as to permit the roots to utilize it\r\nfully, and even to permit, in after years, of the planting of field\r\ncrops where formerly they would not succeed.\r\n\r\n_Leachy Substrata._—While we may thus overcome the disadvantages of a\r\ndense subsoil or hardpan, there is another difficulty not uncommonly\r\nmet with in alluvial lands, which cannot be so readily remedied. It\r\nis the occurrence, at from two to six feet depth, of coarse sand or\r\ngravel, through which capillary moisture will not ascend, but through\r\nwhich irrigation water will waste rapidly, leaving the overlying soil\r\ndry. Then unless very frequent irrigation can be given, the crop will\r\nsuffer from drought, unless indeed the gravel itself is filled with\r\nbottom water upon which the root-ends can draw.\r\n\r\nThis case is a common one in the larger valleys of the arid region, and\r\nin time of unusual drought the sloughs originally existing, but since\r\nfilled up, will be clearly outlined by the dying crops, while outside\r\nof the old channels there may be no suffering.\r\n\r\n_“Going-back” of Orchards._ On such land as this, and on such as has a\r\nshallow soil underlaid by an impervious subsoil, trees will often grow\r\nfinely for three to five years; then suddenly languish, or turn yellow\r\nand die, as the demand of their larger growth exceeds what moisture or\r\nplant-food the shallow soil and subsoil can supply. Enormous losses\r\nhave arisen from this cause in many portions of the arid region, but\r\nmore especially in California, owing to the implicit confidence reposed\r\neven by old settlers, and still more by newcomers, in the excellence\r\nof the lands, as illustrated by farms perhaps a short distance away,\r\nbut differently situated with respect to the country drainage and the\r\ngeological formations. All such disappointments could have been avoided\r\nby an intelligent observation of the substrata, either by probing or\r\ndigging. Important as is such preliminary examination in the region of\r\nsummer rains, it is a _vitally_ needful precaution in the arid region,\r\nwhere the margin between adequate and inadequate depth of soil and\r\nmoisture-supply is much smaller.\r\n\r\n    When farmers note such distress in the orchard, the first\r\n    idea usually is that fertilization is needed. This in the\r\n    almost universally very rich lands of the arid region\r\n    is rarely the case until after many years of exhaustive\r\n    cultivation, and is scarcely ever of more than passing\r\n    benefit in such cases. The first suggestion should always\r\n    be an _examination of the substrata_, and especially\r\n    of the deeper roots; in the diseased or thirsty condition\r\n    of which the cause of the “die-back” or yellowing will\r\n    commonly be found. Of course no amount of fertilization can\r\n    permanently remedy such a state of things, arising from\r\n    impervious substrata, coarse gravel, or shallow bottom water.\r\n\r\n_Hardpan._—By “hardpan” is understood a dense and more or less hardened\r\nlayer in the subsoil, which obstructs the penetration of both roots\r\nand water, thus materially limiting the range of the former both\r\nfor plant-food and moisture, and giving rise to the disadvantages\r\nfollowing such limitation, as described in the case of dense subsoils.\r\nThe hardpans proper differ from the latter, however, in being usually\r\nof limited thickness only; the direct consequence of their mode of\r\nformation, which is not direct deposition by water or other agencies,\r\nbut the infiltration of cementing solutions into a pre-existing\r\nmaterial originally quite similar to that of the surface soil. Such\r\nsolutions usually come from above, more rarely from below, and are of\r\nvery various composition. The solutions of lime carbonate in carbonated\r\nwater have already been referred to in this connection; as has also the\r\nfact that corresponding solutions of silica, associated more or less\r\nwith other products of rock decomposition (see chapters 2 and 4) are\r\nconstantly circulating in soils. The surface soil being the portion\r\nwhere rock-weathering and other soil-forming processes are most active,\r\nthese solutions are chiefly formed there; and according as their\r\ndescent into the substrata is unchecked, or is liable to be arrested\r\nat some particular level, whether by pre-existing close-grained layers\r\nor by the cessation of rains, the subsequent penetration of air, and\r\nevaporation of the water alone by shallow-rooted plants, may cause the\r\naccumulation of the dissolved matter at a certain level, year after\r\nyear. Finally there is formed a subsoil-mass more or less firmly\r\ncemented by the dissolved matters, sometimes to the extent of stony\r\nhardness (lime carbonate in the arid regions, kankar of India), more\r\nusually soft enough to be penetrated by the pick or grubbing hoe, and\r\nsometimes by the stronger roots of certain plants; but resisting both\r\nthe penetration and the assimilation of plant food by the more delicate\r\nfeeding roots.\r\n\r\n_Nature of the Cements._—The nature of the cements that serve to\r\nconsolidate the hardpan mass is substantially the same as those already\r\nmentioned in the discussion of sandstones (chapt. 4, p. 55); with\r\nthe addition of those formed, usually in connection with siliceous\r\nsolutions, by the acids of the humus group. The latter class of\r\nhardpans is especially conspicuous in the case of swampy ground and\r\ndamp forests, where “moorbedpan” and reddish “ortstein” (the latter\r\nparticularly developed in the forests of northern Europe, where it has\r\nbeen studied in detail by Müller and Tuxen[65], are characteristic.)\r\nThe latter gives for a characteristic sample of the reddish hardpan\r\nunderlying a beech forest in Denmark a content of from 2.20 to 4.40%\r\nof ulmic compounds, and shows that the color is due to these and not,\r\nas had been supposed, to ferric oxid, which is present only in minute\r\nquantities.\r\n\r\n[65] See “Studien über die natürlichen Humusformen,” by Dr. P. E.\r\nMüller.\r\n\r\n_Bog ore, Moorbedpan, Ortstein._—It is otherwise with moorbedpan, which\r\noften consists of a mass of bog iron ore permeated more or less with\r\nhumous substances, which impart to it the dark brown tint so often seen\r\nalso in the “black gravel” spots of badly-drained land. On the whole,\r\nhowever, ferric cements are much less frequently found in hardpans than\r\nin sandstones formed above ground.\r\n\r\n_Clay substance_ washed from the surface into the subsoil by rains\r\n(chapter 10, p. 161) always helps materially to render the hardpan\r\nimpervious when afterwards cemented, a much smaller proportion of\r\nthe cementing material sufficing in that case to form a solid layer.\r\nIn such cases however the cement is rarely of a calcareous nature,\r\nsince lime prevents the diffusion and washing-down of the clay. It is\r\nmostly siliceous or zeolitic; if the former, acid will have little or\r\nno effect upon the solidity of the hardpan; while if zeolitic, acid\r\nwill pretty promptly disintegrate it. The presence of humus acids in\r\nthe cements, if not apparent to the eye, is readily demonstrated by\r\nimmersing the hardpan fragment in ammonia water or a weak solution of\r\ncaustic soda; when if humus acids are the main cementing substance the\r\nfragment will fall to crumbs, or be softened to an extent corresponding\r\nto the amount of the humus present. Calcareous hardpan is, of course,\r\nreadily recognized by its quick disintegration by dilute acid, with\r\nevolution of carbonic gas.\r\n\r\nIn “alkali” soils containing sodic carbonate (“black alkali”) there\r\nis commonly found at the depth of two or three feet an exceedingly\r\nrefractory hardpan resulting from the accumulation of puddled clay (see\r\nabove chapt. 4, p. 62) in the subsoil, or sometimes even on the surface\r\nof depressed spots. This hardpan, easily destroyed by the use of gypsum\r\nand water, is described more in detail in chapter 22, on alkali soils;\r\nit blues red litmus paper instantly.\r\n\r\n_The Causes of Hardpan._—The recognition of the _cause_ of hardpan is\r\nof considerable importance to the farmer, because of the influence\r\nof the nature of the cement and the causes of its formation upon the\r\npossibility and methods of its destruction, for the improvement of the\r\nland.\r\n\r\nIt may be said in general that inasmuch as the cause of the formation\r\nof hardpan is a stoppage of the water in its downward penetration, the\r\nre-establishment of that penetration will tend to prevent additional\r\ninduration; moreover, experience proves that whenever this is\r\naccomplished even locally, as around a fruit tree in an orchard, the\r\nhardpan gradually softens and disappears before the frequent changes in\r\nmoisture-conditions and the attack of roots. The use of dynamite for\r\nthis purpose in California has already been referred to; it seems to\r\nbe the only resort when the hardpan lies at a considerable depth. When\r\nit is within reach of the plow, it may be turned up on the surface by\r\nthe aid of a subsoiler and will then gradually disintegrate under the\r\ninfluence of air, rain and sun. But when the hardpan is of the nature\r\nof moorbedpan, containing much humic acid and perhaps underlaid by bog\r\niron ore, the use of lime on the land is indicated, and will in the\r\ncourse of time destroy the hardpan layer. This is the more desirable\r\nas in such cases the surface soil is usually completely leached of its\r\nlime content, and is consequently extremely unthrifty.\r\n\r\nWoodlands of northern countries bearing beech and oak are especially\r\napt to be benefited by the action of lime on the “raw,” acid humous\r\nsoil and underlying hardpan, which is commonly underlaid by a\r\nleaden-blue sandy subsoil (“Bleisand” of the Germans, “Podzol” of\r\nthe Russians) colored brown by earth humates and mostly too moist in\r\nits natural condition to permit of adequate aeration. These soils\r\nare usually of but moderate fertility, and are best suited to forest\r\ngrowth unless somewhat expensive methods of improvement can be put into\r\npractice.\r\n\r\n“_Plowsole._”—An artificial hardpan is very commonly formed under the\r\npractice of plowing to the same depth for many consecutive years. The\r\nconsolidated layer thus created by the action of the plow (hence known\r\nas plowsole) acts precisely like a natural hardpan, and is sometimes\r\nthe cause of the formation of a cemented subsoil crust simulating\r\nthe natural product. This is most apt to occur in clayey lands, and\r\ngreatly increases the difficulty of working them, while detracting\r\nmaterially from the higher productiveness commonly attributed to them\r\nas compared with sandy lands. Of course it is perfectly easy to prevent\r\nthis trouble by plowing to different depths in consecutive years, and\r\nrunning a subsoil plow from time to time. In this case, also, lime\r\nwill generally be very useful and be found to aid materially in the\r\ndisintegration of the “plowsole.”\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to insist farther upon the need of the\r\nexamination of land to be occupied, for the existence of hardpan or\r\nother faulty subsoil, which may totally defeat for the time being the\r\nfarmer’s efforts, or make him lose his investment in plantations after\r\na few years. Probing by means of the steel rod described above (p. 177)\r\nor boring with a post-hole auger; or finally, if necessary, digging a\r\npit to the proper depth (from four to six feet in the arid region),\r\nshould precede every purchase of new or unexplored agricultural land.\r\n\r\n_Marly Substrata._—Among the causes of failure occasionally found in\r\nthe case of the “going-back” of orchards, is the occurrence of strongly\r\ncalcareous or marly substrata, at depths which in the humid region\r\nwould not be reached by the roots, but in the course of a few years are\r\ninevitably penetrated by the roots of trees in the arid region. Then\r\nthere appears a stunting of the growth, and sometimes a yellowing of\r\nleaves, or chlorosis, due to the influence of excessive calcareousness\r\nat the depth of four or five feet. For this of course there is no\r\nremedy except the planting of crops which, like the mulberry, Texas\r\ngrapes, Chickasaw plum and others, are at home on such lands; which in\r\nthe Eastern states are naturally occupied by the crab apple, honey\r\nlocust and wild plums.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nTHE WATER OF SOILS.\r\n\r\nHYGROSCOPIC AND CAPILLARY MOISTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen it is remembered that from 65 to over 90% of the fresh substance\r\nof plants consists of water, the importance of an adequate and regular\r\nsupply of the same to growing plants is readily understood. But it\r\nseems desirable, before discussing the relations of water to the soil\r\nand to plant life, to consider first the physical peculiarities which\r\ndistinguish it from nearly all other substances known. That it is\r\ncolorless, tasteless, inodorous, and also chemically neutral, alone\r\nconstitutes a group of properties scarcely found in any other fluid.\r\nBut its special adaptation to its functions in relation to vegetable\r\nand animal life are much more fundamental, as is shown in the table of\r\nits physical constants as compared with other well-known substances,\r\ngiven below.\r\n\r\n     PHYSICAL FACTORS OF WATER COMPARED WITH OTHER SUBSTANCES\r\n                      (PER UNIT WEIGHT).\r\n     ================================+===================================\r\n     Capillary ascent in glass tubes |     Specific Heats.\r\n           of one mm. diameter.      |\r\n                                     |\r\n     Water                     14 mm.| Water         1.000\r\n     Alcohol                    6 mm.| Ice            .502\r\n     Olive oil                  1 mm.| Steam          .475\r\n                                     | Clay, Glass    .180-.200\r\n                                     | Charcoal       .241\r\n             HEAT RELATIONS.         | Wood           .032\r\n                 Density.            | Gold, Lead     .032-.031\r\n                                     | Zinc           .096\r\n     Water at 0° C.

Its high “heat of fusion”\r\nalso serves to prevent quick freezing of plant and animal tissues, so\r\nthat the brief prevalence of a low temperature may be more readily\r\nborne. Finally, the large amount of heat absorbed in evaporation of\r\nwater serves to keep both plants and animals cool under excessive\r\nexternal temperatures which would otherwise quickly destroy life.\r\n\r\n_Capillarity or Surface Tension._—In this table it will be noted,\r\nfirst, that water rises higher in fine (“capillary”) or hair tubes\r\nthan the other fluids mentioned, which fairly represent all others. No\r\nother fluid approaches water in the height to which it will rise[66]\r\nin either soils or plant tissues. Were its capillary factor no higher\r\nthan, _e. g._, that of oil or alcohol, trees could not grow as tall\r\nas we find them, and the water supply from the substrata, and all\r\nthe movements of water in the soil, and hence plant growth, would be\r\nsimilarly retarded. It is easy to verify these differences by immersing\r\na cylinder of clay soil (or a cotton wick) in water on the one hand,\r\nand in oil or alcohol on the other. Notwithstanding the greater\r\nfluidity of alcohol as compared with water, the latter will be found to\r\nfill the porous mass much more quickly.\r\n\r\n[66] Excepting only the water-solutions of certain salts, among which\r\ncommon salt, kainit and nitrate of soda are of agricultural interest.\r\nCommon salt may increase the capillary rise to the extent of more than\r\nfive per cent.\r\n\r\n    The smaller the diameter of the tube, the higher will the\r\n    water rise in it, and the greater will be the curvature\r\n    of its upper surface, to which the rise is sensibly\r\n    proportional. But in the case of liquids which do not “wet”\r\n    the walls of the tube (as in that of mercury and glass),\r\n    the curve (meniscus) is convex, instead of concave, and the\r\n    liquid is depressed instead of rising.\r\n\r\nIt is in its _relations to heat_, however, that water is specially\r\ndistinguished from other substances; and these differences are most\r\nvital not only to living organisms, but to the entire economy of Nature.\r\n\r\n_Density._—As regards the density or specific gravity of water (which\r\nis by common consent assumed as the unit of comparison), it will be\r\nseen from the “Density” table that whereas all other bodies contract\r\nand become more dense as they grow colder, water has its point of\r\n(fluid) “maximum density” at 4°C. (49°.2 Fahr.), and _expands_ as it\r\ngrows colder, until at 0°C. (32° Fahr.) it solidifies into ice. In\r\nso doing it departs still farther from the rule obtaining with all\r\nother bodies (excepting certain mixtures, such as type metal) and\r\nagain expands so as to decrease the density from .99988 to .92800;\r\nthus causing ice to float on water at the freezing point. Hence water,\r\nunlike all other fluids, solidifies first on the surface; and but for\r\nthis, the thawing of the winter’s ice, which would be formed at the\r\nbottom of rivers and lakes, would be deferred until late in summer. The\r\nexpansion of water in freezing is forcibly illustrated in the bursting\r\nof water pipes and pitchers in winter; in the soil, the ice forming in\r\nthe interstices serves to loosen the compacted land and give it better\r\ntilth for the ensuing season.\r\n\r\n_Specific Heat._—Considering next, the column showing the “specific\r\nheat” of water as compared with other substances, we see that it\r\nexceeds all other known bodies in the amount of heat required to change\r\nits temperature; hence again, _its_ heat capacity is taken as the unit\r\nto which all others are compared. The figures given in the table show\r\nthat even ice and steam require for equal weights only about half as\r\nmuch heat (or burning of fuel) to change their temperature (_e. g._,\r\n1 degree) as would liquid water. But earthy matters, such as clay or\r\nsoil and glass, require only one-fifth as much heat for a similar\r\nchange; charcoal only about one-fourth as much. But vegetable matter as\r\nrepresented by wood on the one hand, and gold and lead on the other,\r\nrequire only about one-thirtieth as much heat as an equal weight of\r\nwater; zinc about one-tenth as much, steel somewhat more.\r\n\r\nIt is thus plain that masses of water act powerfully, more than any\r\nother substance, as moderators of changes of temperature by their\r\nmere presence. The body of an animal or plant is protected against\r\nviolent changes by the presence of from 60% to 90% of liquid water,\r\nthe temperature of which can only be raised or lowered slowly; and\r\nthe presence of the sea tempers the climates of coasts and islands\r\nas compared with the heat or cold occurring in the interior of the\r\ncontinents.\r\n\r\n_Ice._—Again, it is shown in the table that the heat required to _melt\r\nice_ is greater than in the case of any other substance, especially\r\nthe metals; which when once heated to the fusing point, require only a\r\nvery little more heat to become liquid. The fusion of salts (including\r\nsilicate rocks) requires more heat than does that of the pure metals.\r\n\r\n_Vaporization._—In the amount of heat required for its _vaporization_\r\nwater is also especially pre-eminent, and potent in its influence upon\r\norganic life. The table shows that the evaporation of water requires\r\nsix hundred heat units[67] as compared with alcohol, requiring only two\r\nhundred; while spirits of turpentine, the representative of a large\r\nproportion of vegetable fluids, needs but sixty-seven.\r\n\r\n[67] A heat unit, or “calorie,” is the amount of heat required to raise\r\nthe temperature of a unit-weight (pound, kilogram, or gram) of water\r\none thermometric degree. According to the unit-weight and thermometric\r\nscale used, the figures will vary, but in this text the basis is\r\nunderstood to be kilograms and the centigrade scale.\r\n\r\nThe practical result is that evaporation of water from the surface\r\nof animals and the leaves of plants, is exceedingly effective in\r\npreventing excessive rise of temperature, the heat of the sun and air\r\nbeing spent in evaporating the perspiration of animals and plants\r\nbefore an injurious rise of temperature, such as would cause sunstroke\r\nin animals, and wilting or withering in plants, can occur. But since\r\nevaporation is most rapid in dry air, it follows that the cooling\r\neffect will be the greater in the arid regions than in the humid. In\r\nthe latter, therefore, sunstroke is much more frequent than in the\r\nfervid regions of the arid west, even though the temperature in the\r\nlatter may be higher by twenty or twenty-five degrees Fahrenheit.\r\nWhite men who would soon succumb if they attempted to work in the\r\nsun in Mississippi or Louisiana when the thermometer stands at 95°F.\r\nwill experience no inconvenience under the same conditions in the dry\r\natmosphere of the Great Valley of California.\r\n\r\n_Solvent Power._—To the exceptional properties of water discussed\r\nabove, should be added another hardly less important one, viz., that\r\nof being an almost universal solvent especially of mineral matters,\r\nincluding even those which, like quartz, appear to be most insoluble\r\nand refractory (see chapt. 3). The water of the soil is thus enabled\r\nto convey to the roots of plants, in solution, all kinds of plant\r\nfood contained in the soil. It should be noted that distilled (hence\r\nalso rain-) water is a more powerful solvent, _e. g._, of glass, than\r\nordinary waters containing mineral matter, and even free acids.\r\n\r\nPractically, plants take up _all_ their water supply from the soil\r\nin the liquid form; and hence the soil-conditions with respect to\r\nthis supply are of the most vital importance to plant growth. The\r\nmost abundant supply of mineral plant food may be wholly useless,\r\nunless the physical conditions of adequate soil-moisture, access of\r\nair, and warmth, are fulfilled at the same time. On the other hand,\r\ncomparatively few plants are adapted to healthy growth in soils\r\nsaturated with water, or in water itself; and but few among these are\r\nof special interest from the agricultural standpoint.\r\n\r\n_Water-requirements of Growing Plants._—The amount of water contained\r\nin any plant at one time, however large, is but a small proportion of\r\nwhat is necessary to carry it through its full development. When we\r\nmeasure the amount of water actually evaporated through the plant in\r\nthe course of its normal growth, we find it to be several hundred times\r\nthe quantity of dry vegetable substance produced; varying according\r\nto the extent and structure of the leaf-surface, the number and size\r\nof the breathing pores (stomata) of the leaves, and the climatic\r\nconditions (including specially the duration of active vegetation, and\r\ntemperature during the same), from 225 to as much as 912 times the\r\nweight of the mature, dry plant.\r\n\r\nThe following are extreme figures for water consumption of different\r\nplants as reported by different observers, viz., Lawes and Gilbert in\r\nEngland, Hellriegel in northern Germany, Wollny in Southern Germany\r\n(Munich), and King in Wisconsin: Wheat, 225 to 359; barley, 262 to 774;\r\noats, 402 to 665; red clover, 249 to 453; peas, 235 to 447; mustard\r\nand rape, 845 to 912 respectively; the latter figure being the maximum\r\nthus far reported. The highest figures given are throughout very nearly\r\nthose of Wollny, working in the very rainy climate of Munich.\r\n\r\n_Evaporation from Plants in Different Climates._—It might be expected\r\nthat in countries where the air is usually moist, the evaporation\r\nwill, other things being equal, be less than where it is commonly far\r\nbelow the point of saturation. But the “guardian cells” (stomata) of\r\nthe leaf pores possess the power of regulating, to a certain extent,\r\nthe evaporation from the leaf-surface in accordance with temporarily\r\nprevailing conditions, so as to allow free evaporation in moist air,\r\nbut to prevent the wilting and drying-up of the leaf in hot and dry\r\nair, save in extreme cases. Moreover, plants adapted to arid conditions\r\nare usually provided with additional safeguards in the form of thick,\r\nnon-conducting layers of surface cells, or long channels connecting the\r\ninterior tissue with the breathing-pores on the surface. Often hairy,\r\nscaly or viscous coverings serve the same end. On the other hand, when\r\nthe air is very moist, so as to check evaporation, water is sometimes\r\nfound secreted in minute droplets around the breathing-pores of the\r\nleaves, since its ascent is a necessary condition of nutrition and\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n_Relation between Evaporation and Plant-growth._—There is not in all\r\ncases any direct relation between the amount of evaporation and plant\r\ngrowth; but experience, as well as numerous rigorous experiments\r\nhave shown that _under ordinary conditions of culture, and within\r\nlimits varying for different soils and crops, production is almost\r\ndirectly proportional to the water supply during the period of active\r\nvegetation_.\r\n\r\nOn the basis of Hellriegel’s results, showing that wheat uses (in\r\nGermany) about 435 tons, or nearly four acre-inches of water in the\r\nproduction of one ton of dry matter, and assuming the ratio of grain\r\nto straw to be 1:1.5, King calculates the following table of probable\r\nproduction under different moisture conditions (Physics of Agriculture,\r\npage 140):\r\n\r\n                           YIELD PER ACRE.\r\n    =========+===========+===========+=========+=============\r\n    Number of| Weight of | Weight of | Total   | Water used.\r\n    Bushels. |  Grain.   |  Straw.   | Weight. | Acre-inches.\r\n             |   Tons.   |   Tons.   |  Tons.  |\r\n    ---------+-----------+-----------+---------+-------------\r\n       15    |     .45   |  .675     |  1.125  |    4.498\r\n       20    |     .60   |  .90      |  1.500  |    5.998\r\n       25    |     .75   | 1.125     |  1.875  |    7.497\r\n       30    |     .90   | 1.350     |  2.250  |    8.997\r\n       35    |    1.05   | 1.575     |  2.625  |   10.495\r\n       40    |    1.20   | 1.800     |  3.000  |   12.000\r\n    ---------+-----------+-----------+---------+-------------\r\n\r\nS. Fortier has made several series of tests to determine the actual\r\nyield of grain crops under field conditions when supplied with\r\ndifferent amounts of water. Two of these were made at the Montana\r\nexperiment station in 1902 and 1903, (see reports of these years), in\r\nlarge tanks placed in a field, level with the ground. The results of\r\nthe last year’s experiments are shown graphically in the figure below,\r\nfrom which it will be seen that the yield increased quite regularly\r\nwith the amount of water supplied, up to the depth of 36 inches of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 37.—Experiments on Cereal production with various\r\namounts of water (Fortier, Report Mont. Expt. Sta., 1903).]\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that in this case (and as usual) not only the\r\nquantity but the quality of the grain was greatly improved as the\r\nwater-supply increased, it becoming larger and more uniform in size.\r\n\r\nOf similar experiments made in the San Joaquin Valley, California, in\r\n1904, Fortier says:[68]\r\n\r\n    “In experimenting with barley last winter the natural\r\n    rainfall, which amounted to 4½ inches during the period of\r\n    growth, produced at the rate of nine bushels per acre, while\r\n    the application of sixteen inches of water increased the\r\n    yield to twenty-two bushels per acre. In the same case; of\r\n    wheat, the rainfall, alone, produced straw, but no grain;\r\n    four inches of additional irrigation water produced a yield\r\n    at the rate of ten bushels, and sixteen inches of water\r\n    increased the yield to thirty-eight bushels per acre.”\r\n\r\n[68] “Water and Forest,” January, 1905. “The Use of Water,” by S.\r\nFortier.\r\n\r\nIt is thus obvious that, other things being equal and with conditions\r\nsufficiently favorable for the growth of crops, the rule as formulated\r\nabove is verified in practice.\r\n\r\n    Whitney (Bulletin 22, Bureau of Soils, U.S. Dept. Agr.),\r\n    has carried this rule so far as to claim that in all soils,\r\n    the moisture supply is the _only_ important factor,\r\n    and that so long as this is provided for, soil fertility\r\n    continues indefinitely without replacement of ingredients\r\n    withdrawn. The latter conclusion is so thoroughly disproved\r\n    by experience as well as experiment that it hardly requires\r\n    discussion here.\r\n\r\nWhether plants, especially cultivated ones, are capable of adapting\r\nthemselves to arid conditions so as to be capable of producing\r\nsatisfactory crops with less water than is actually consumed in the\r\nhumid region, has not been directly determined. Such is, however, the\r\nimpression produced by farming experience; and the fact that among\r\nthe common weeds of arid California are mustard and rape, cited by\r\nWollny[69] as requiring over three times as much water as does maize\r\nfor the production of one part of dry matter, lends color to the\r\nsupposition that in some manner these, and probably other plants, use\r\nmore water in humid than in dry climates (see this chapt. p. 212).\r\n\r\n[69] See Wollny’s experiments, Forsch. Agr. Phys. Vol. 20, p. 58.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore impossible to assign a definite figure for the amount\r\nof water required by vegetation _at large_; and even for one and the\r\nsame plant, only approximations conditioned upon climatic factors can\r\nbe given. We can in many cases, however, assign for one plant, or for\r\ncertain groups of plants, the amounts of water producing the best\r\nresults (“optimum”) and the least amount (“minimum”) compatible with\r\na paying crop, that must be furnished during the growing season, to\r\nproduce certain results. For when instead of fruiting, it is desired\r\nthat the crop should produce the largest possible amount of vegetable\r\nsubstance, as in the case of forage crops, a larger amount of water\r\nwill usually be serviceable.\r\n\r\n_Different conditions of Soil-Water._—Water may be contained in the\r\nsoil in three different conditions, viz.:\r\n\r\n1. From absorption of water vapor; Hygroscopic water.\r\n\r\n2. Liquid water held suspended between the soil particles so as to\r\nexert no hydrostatic pressure; capillary water, or water of imbibition.\r\n\r\n3. Liquid water seeking its level; bottom, ground or hydrostatic water.\r\n\r\n\r\nHYGROSCOPIC WATER.\r\n\r\nSoils artificially dried so as to deprive them of all their moisture,\r\nwhen exposed to moist air absorb water vapor with great energy at\r\nfirst; both the rapidity of absorption and the amounts absorbed, when\r\nfull time is given, varying greatly with their nature. Sandy soils,\r\nbroadly speaking, absorb the smallest amounts; while clayey soils, and\r\nthose containing much humus, or finely divided ferric hydrate, take up\r\nthe largest proportion.\r\n\r\nThe figure expressing the amount of aqueous vapor absorbed at the\r\nstandard temperature of 15° Cent., is called the _coefficient of\r\nmoisture absorption_. For one and the same substance, this coefficient\r\nrises as the grain becomes finer, the surface being correspondingly\r\nincreased (see chapt. 6).\r\n\r\nThe table below indicates the effect of the three substances mentioned\r\nin increasing moisture absorption as compared with a very sandy soil\r\nfrom the pine woods of Mississippi, and a gray silt or “dust” soil\r\nfrom Washington, very fine-grained but poor both in humus and ferric\r\nhydrate. (For details of the physical composition of the Mississippi\r\nsoils see table in chapt. 6, p. 93). A highly ferruginous soil from\r\nOahu shows plainly the effect of that substance.\r\n\r\n    TABLE SHOWING INFLUENCE OF SILT, SAND, CLAY, FERRIC HYDRATE,\r\n               AND HUMUS ON MOISTURE ABSORPTION.\r\n    ================================+======+======+=====+=========\r\n                                    | 248  |  79  | 238 |   230\r\n                                    |      |      |     |\r\n                                    |Miss. |Wash’n|Miss.|  Miss.\r\n                                    |Pine  | Dust |White|Flatwoods\r\n                                    |Hills | Soil.|Pipe |  Clay\r\n                                    |Sandy |      |Clay.|  Soil.\r\n                                    |Loam. |      |     |\r\n                                    |      |      |     |\r\n                                    |  %   |   %  |  %  |   %\r\n    --------------------------------+------+------+-----+---------\r\n    Hygr.

The influence of humus is\r\nplainly shown in the case of the marsh muck and soil, neither of which\r\ncontain any appreciable amount of either clay, or ferric hydrate in\r\nthe finely diffused condition. The relatively slight difference in the\r\nabsorptions of muck and soil is due to the only partial humification of\r\nthe organic matter in the former, while in the soil the humification is\r\nsensibly complete, and the sand forming the body of the material serves\r\nto render it more loose.\r\n\r\nThese data, referring to natural materials, while not as complete\r\nas could be desired, are sufficient to prove the facts, and seem\r\npreferable to any artificially devised imitation of their kind.\r\n\r\n_Influence of Temperature, and Degree of Air-Saturation._—The amount\r\nof moisture absorbed varies materially both with the temperature,\r\nand with the degree of saturation of the air to which the soil is\r\nexposed. Schübler, Knop and other earlier observers, operating with\r\nearth exposed to air only partly saturated, and with soil layers of\r\nconsiderable thickness (in watch glasses), found that the absorption\r\ndecreased as the temperature increased, according to a law formulated\r\nby Knop. The writer found that under the conditions established in the\r\nexperiments of Knop and others, the air was not nearly saturated,[70]\r\nso that these determinations are marred by ineliminable faults, the\r\nmore as the soils used are only designated in general terms, as “garden\r\nsoil,” “loam,” “peaty land,” etc., without any definite indication of\r\ntheir actual physical or chemical constitution. The writer therefore\r\nundertook to correlate these coefficients, determined with respect to\r\ncompletely saturated air, with the physical composition of certain\r\nsoils, as determined by means of the methods heretofore described.\r\n\r\n[70] It should be understood that it is by no means easy to insure full\r\nsaturation in any considerable volume of air.\r\n\r\nIt has generally been considered sufficient to cover with water the\r\nbottom of the space in which absorption was to occur. The writer found\r\nthat in order to insure uniform results, it was necessary to cover the\r\nentire inner surface of the vessel with wet blotting paper, and even\r\nthen to exclude carefully all circulation of air by padding the joints\r\nwith such paper. When only the bottom of the box was covered, samples\r\nplaced at different levels above the water surface gave discordant\r\nresults. It was also observed that whenever the thickness of the soil\r\nlayer exceeded about one millimeter, a long time was required for\r\nfull saturation; during which inevitable changes of temperature would\r\nbring about a deposition of dew on the soil, greatly exaggerating the\r\nabsorptive coefficient.\r\n\r\nIn the chamber used at the California station for soil saturation,\r\ndimensions 12 × 18 × 19 inches high, the same soil was exposed on a\r\nshelf close to the surface of the water, another midway up, a third\r\nnear the lower surface of the cover; liquid water being in the bottom\r\nof the chamber, and the rest covered with wet blotters. It was found\r\nthat despite these precautions, the lowest soil layer absorbed in the\r\nsame time as much as ¾% more than the uppermost one.\r\n\r\n    Some of the data so obtained are given in the table of\r\n    physical soil composition on page 93, chapt. 6. They\r\n    have since been extensively supplemented by additional\r\n    determinations, but without materially changing the\r\n    coefficients approximately corresponding to the several\r\n    designations accepted in farm practice. Experiments\r\n    conducted by the writer have conclusively shown that Knop’s\r\n    law of decrease of absorption with rise of temperature not\r\n    only is not true for _fully_ saturated air, but must be\r\n    reversed; the fact being that the amount of water absorbed\r\n    by the soil _increases in a fully saturated atmosphere_\r\n    (i.e., in presence of excess of water) _as the temperature\r\n    rises_, at least between 15 and 35 degrees Cent. Thus,\r\n    fine sandy soil which at 15° absorbed 2% of moisture, took\r\n    up 4% at 34°; while loam soil absorbing 7% at 15°, showed\r\n    nearly 9% at 35°; an increase of 2% in each case. But in\r\n    partially saturated air[71] it was found that, as stated by\r\n    Knop, the amounts absorbed steadily decrease, though not\r\n    according to the law announced by him. Taking as a unit\r\n    the moisture absorbed at 15°, it was found that in air\r\n    three-fourths saturated, ¾ of the unit was taken up by the\r\n    soil; at half saturation, nearly the proportional amount;\r\n    but at one-fourth saturation the earths absorb materially\r\n    more than a similar proportion, being then capable of\r\n    withdrawing moisture from greatly undersaturated air. Since\r\n    air thus undersaturated occurs not uncommonly in the arid\r\n    regions of the world, the fact that the soil cannot be\r\n    farther dried by such air of the same temperature, is of\r\n    some practical significance.\r\n\r\n[71] The partial saturation to a definite extent was effected by means\r\nof solutions of calcium chlorid of different degrees of concentration,\r\naccording to the determinations of Wüllner (Pogg. Ann.). These\r\nsolutions were placed in a wide, flat dish, over which a layer of soil\r\n1 mm. in thickness was exposed, all being covered with a bell glass\r\nlined inside with the same solution, so as to insure equal saturation.\r\n\r\nIn view of the highly variable composition of soils and of the\r\ndoubtless varying hygroscopic properties of their several physical\r\nconstituents, it is not to be expected that any one numerical law will\r\nhold good exactly for all kinds of lands. Mineral powders, colloidal\r\nclay, ferric hydrate, aluminic hydrate, the zeolites, humus, and other\r\nhydrates known to occur, doubtless each follow a different law in the\r\nabsorption of moisture and gases; so as to modify the hygroscopic\r\nproperties[72] of the soil in accordance with their relative\r\npredominance in each case. (See table of absorption of gases, chapter\r\n14).\r\n\r\n_Utility of Hygroscopic Moisture to Plant-growth._—The early\r\nexperimenters considered the hygroscopic moisture of the soil to be\r\nof very great importance to the welfare of crops. Within the last\r\ntwenty-five years much doubt has been cast upon this claim, even to\r\nthe extent of stating that “the hygroscopic efficacy of soils must\r\nbe definitely eliminated from among the useful properties” (Mayer’s\r\nAgriculturchemie, vol. 2, p. 131). Yet Mayer himself concedes the\r\ncogency of the experiments made by Sachs, which proved that dry soil\r\nimmersed in a (probably not even fully) saturated atmosphere is capable\r\nof supplying the requirements of normal vegetation; thus explaining the\r\nobvious beneficial effects on vegetation of the summer fogs prevailing\r\nin portions of the arid region, _e. g._; on the coasts of California\r\nand Chile.\r\n\r\n[72] E. A. Mitscherlich (Bodenkunde für Land-und Forstwirthe, p. 156\r\net al.) claims that all determinations of soil hygroscopicity thus far\r\nmade are grossly incorrect on account of the dew liable to be condensed\r\non the soil layer from fully saturated air, as the result of slight\r\nchanges of temperature. He therefore would have all such determination\r\nmade either in an air-vacuum, or over a 10% solution of sulfuric acid.\r\n\r\nSuch dew-formation, however, cannot happen to any appreciable extent\r\nunder the conditions maintained in the writer’s work, viz, absorption\r\nwithin a thick-walled (two-inch) wooden box of the dimensions given\r\nabove, and sunk in the ground in a cellar in which the temperature\r\nvaries only a few tenths of a degree during 24 hours. The soil layer\r\nof one millimeter thickness being put down in the morning, the 7 hour\r\nabsorption period falls at the time of slightly rising temperature, as\r\nan additional precaution against dew-deposition. Mitscherlich fails,\r\nmoreover, to show that this source of error produces any wide or\r\nserious discrepancies except under such long absorption periods as he\r\nfinds it necessary to use because of the great thickness of his soil\r\nlayers. It is doubtful whether the limits of errors in soil sampling\r\ndo not greatly exceed any of those involved in the writer’s method,\r\nand whether such accuracy as is attempted by Mitscherlich is of any\r\npractical significance.\r\n\r\n    Mayer’s experiments relied upon to prove the uselessness\r\n    of hygroscopic moisture to plant growth, were carried out\r\n    in flower-pots, in which it was plainly shown that the\r\n    plants wilted before even the visible liquid (capillary)\r\n    moisture of the earth was entirely exhausted. But this\r\n    simply proves that under such artificial conditions, plants\r\n    cannot withdraw moisture from the soil _rapidly_ enough\r\n    for their needs. In _nature_, and notably in the arid\r\n    regions, the chief supply of water is received through the\r\n    deep-going main roots, while the bulk of the active feeding\r\n    roots of the plant may be surrounded by almost air-dry\r\n    soil; under which conditions, as Henrici (Henneberg’s\r\n    Journ., 1863, p. 280) has shown, slow growth and nutrition\r\n    occurs even in such plants as the raspberry, a native of\r\n    humid climates. But in the arid region this is the normal\r\n    condition of the native vegetation through most of the\r\n    rainless summer. That a higher moisture-coefficient does not\r\n    necessarily imply that a larger amount of moisture can be\r\n    withdrawn from the soil by the plants, is undoubtedly true\r\n    in some, but not in all cases; for in soils rich in humus,\r\n    the moisture is more freely shared with the roots than in\r\n    non-humous, clay lands.\r\n\r\nThe higher moisture-absorption is however of the most unquestionable\r\nservice in the case of the occurrence of the hot, dry winds that so\r\nfrequently threaten the entire crops of some regions. In this case the\r\nsoil containing the greater amount of moisture requires a much longer\r\ntime to be dried, and heated up to the point of injury to the roots,\r\nthan in the case of sandy soils of low absorptive power, whose store\r\nis exhausted in a few hours and then permits the surface to be heated\r\nup to the scalding point, searing the stems and root crowns. That such\r\ninjury occurs much sooner in sandy lands than in well-cultivated clay\r\nsoils, is a matter of common note in the arid region.\r\n\r\n_Summary._—The significance of hygroscopic moisture in connection with\r\nplant growth may then be thus summarized:\r\n\r\n1. Soils of high hygroscopic power can withdraw from moist air enough\r\nmoisture to be of material help in _sustaining_ the life of vegetation\r\nin rainless summers, or in time of drought. It cannot, however,\r\nmaintain normal growth, save in the case of some desert plants.\r\n\r\n2. High moisture-absorption prevents the rapid and undue heating of the\r\nsurface soil to the danger point, and thus often saves crops that are\r\nlost in soils of low hygroscopic power.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPILLARY WATER.\r\n\r\nThe liquid water held in the pores of the soil, in the form of surface\r\nfilms representing the curved surface seen in capillary tubes, and\r\ntherefore tending to cause the water to move upwards, as well as in\r\nall other directions, until uniformity of tension is established, is\r\nof vastly higher importance to plant growth than hygroscopic moisture.\r\nIt not only serves normally as the vehicle of all plant food absorbed\r\nduring the growth of the usual crops, but also, as a rule, to sustain\r\nthe enormous evaporation by which the plant maintains during the heat\r\nof the day, a temperature sufficiently low to permit of the proper\r\noperation of the processes of assimilation and building of cell tissue.\r\n\r\nComparatively few plants have roots adapted to healthy action while\r\nsubmerged in water, excluding them from free access of the oxygen of\r\nthe air; and when such roots are formed by plants not naturally growing\r\nin water or swampy ground, they differ so far from earth-roots in\r\ntheir structure that when transferred to soil they usually die, normal\r\nearth-roots being gradually formed instead. Conversely, there is for\r\nall land plants a definite time-limit beyond which their roots cannot\r\nlive, or at least remain healthy, in submersion. Thus grain fields\r\nwill with difficulty recover from a week’s total submersion; while\r\nyoung rice fields will resist considerably longer. When in the resting\r\n(winter) condition vineyards will bear submergence for thirty-five and\r\neven forty days, deciduous orchards about three weeks; but when in the\r\ngrowing condition, injury is suffered much more quickly.\r\n\r\nIt follows that whenever the soil-pores remain completely filled with\r\nwater for a length of time, there is danger to the welfare of nearly\r\nall plants commonly cultivated in the temperate zones. It is therefore\r\nimportant to know how much water will bring about this undesirable\r\ncondition in the different kinds of soil.\r\n\r\nTo determine this point we may either employ the determination of pore\r\nspace by a comparison of the density of the soil constituents (see\r\nchap. 7, p. 107) with the volume weight of the soil; or we may measure\r\ndirectly the amount of water required to fill the pore-space. For the\r\nlatter purpose it is only necessary to measure the amount of water\r\n(conveniently flowing from a graduated pipette) which, rising slowly\r\nfrom below in a U-shaped tube so as to expel all the air before it, is\r\nrequired to fill a definite weight or volume of the soil entirely full,\r\nso as to rise to its surface. We thus ascertain the amount of empty\r\nspace existing within the soil,[73] which in the absence of water will\r\nordinarily be filled by air.\r\n\r\n[73] Simple as this operation appears to be, it is found to be by no\r\nmeans easy to expel with certainty every small air bubble without\r\nresorting to means which would destroy the natural condition of the\r\nsoil; such as boiling, or the use of the air-pump. These determinations\r\ncannot therefore lay claim to great accuracy.\r\n\r\nIn most cultivated soils, as already stated, the air-space constitutes\r\nabout 25% to 50% of their volume; and this space when filled with water\r\nrepresents what is commonly termed their _maximum water capacity_ or\r\nsaturation point. It is of interest to know this, because it has been\r\nascertained from experience that in order that plants may reach their\r\nbest development, the capillary water present should not amount to\r\nmore than 60%, or less than 40% of its maximum water-holding capacity;\r\nthus leaving about half the pore-space filled with air. This optimum,\r\nhowever, varies somewhat for different plants, some, like celery, being\r\nmore tolerant of excess, and others being more tolerant of a deficiency\r\nof moisture, as is the _e. g._, egg-plant, originally a desert growth.\r\n\r\n_Capillary Ascent of Water in Soil Columns._—When a column of dry soil\r\n(e. g., contained in a glass tube closed with muslin at the lower end)\r\nis brought in contact with water, the latter is soon seen to ascend in\r\nthe soil, wetting it and thus changing its color so as to permit of\r\nready observation of its progress. At first the rise is comparatively\r\nrapid, in some cases as much as an inch in one minute; but it soon\r\nslows down and after a time ranging from a few days to many months,\r\nreaches a maximum height beyond which the liquid water will not rise.\r\nThe ascent is most rapid, and stops soonest, in coarse sandy soils; it\r\nrises most slowly, but in the end considerably higher, in heavy clay\r\nsoils. The most rapid continuous rise, and ultimately the highest,\r\noccurs in salty soils containing but a small proportion of clay. The\r\nmaximum height of capillary rise thus far observed, viz. 10.17 feet,\r\nwas noted in the case of quartz tailings from a stamp mill, ranging\r\nfrom .005 mm. to .016 mm. in diameter; but it took about 18 months’\r\ntime to reach this maximum. The excessively fine texture of clay\r\nopposes great frictional resistance to the movement of the water, and\r\nthe same is true of the finest silts, which, like clay, remain almost\r\nindefinitely suspended in water. But it must be remembered that while\r\npure grains of silt will in wetting remain unchanged in size, clay\r\nparticles, and the clay incrusting silt grains, will on wetting swell\r\ngreatly, and thus fill up the interstices, largely closing them up\r\nagainst the passage of water.\r\n\r\nThese facts are exemplified and graphically illustrated below.\r\n\r\nThe soils selected for this illustration, from California localities,\r\nare the following:\r\n\r\n_No. 233._ Very sandy soil from near Morano, Stanislaus County. Typical\r\nof the noted wheat-growing region of the lower San Joaquin Valley,\r\nfrom northern Merced to Southern San Joaquin Counties; bench or plains\r\nlands. First foot.\r\n\r\n_No. 1197._ Sandy alluvial soil from near the confluence of the Gila\r\nand Colorado rivers, near Yuma. Very deep, light and easily cultivated.\r\nFirst foot, but almost identical to 15 feet.\r\n\r\n_No. 168._ Silty alluvial soil from the old alluvium of the Santa Clara\r\nRiver, near Santa Paula, Ventura County. Very deep, very easily tilled;\r\na typical alluvial loam of the arid region.\r\n\r\n_No. 1697._ Black adobe or clay soil, from the experiment station\r\ngrounds, Berkeley. A heavy clay soil, originally a swamp deposit,\r\nbecoming very tenacious when wet. An excellent wheat soil.\r\n\r\nThe physical analyses of these soils are given below.\r\n\r\n                    PHYSICAL ANALYSES OF TYPICAL SOILS.\r\n    ==============================+=====+=========================+======\r\n                                  |     |          Silt.          |Sand,\r\n                                  |     +------------+------------+2.0 to\r\n                                  |Clay.|   Fine,    |  Coarse,   |64 mm.\r\n                                  |     |  <.25 to   |.5 to 2. mm.|h. v.\r\n                                  |     |.5 mm. h. v.|   h. v.    |\r\n    ------------------------------+-----+------------+------------+------\r\n    No.  233.

It outstrips at once both the sandy soil from Stanislaus,\r\nwhich contains a trifle less of clay, and the silt soil from Ventura,\r\nfrom which at first sight it does not seem to differ widely, but which\r\ncontains considerably more clay. It is doubtless the latter which so\r\ngreatly retards the motion of the water, as is still farther seen in\r\nthe case of the clay or adobe soil. It will be noted that on the second\r\nand third days, the Gila soil had raised the water nearly twice as\r\nhigh as the adobe, and that it took only 18 hours to raise it nearly\r\nthe same height as that attained by the Ventura silt in so many days.\r\nBut it ceased to rise after the 125th day, while the Ventura soil,\r\ncontinuing for 195 days, finally rose 3 inches higher. The adobe also\r\ncontinued its rise, but did not reach the same height as the Gila soil\r\nby nearly two inches. There can be no doubt that the energetic and high\r\nrise of the latter proves an important factor in the culture of these\r\nlands.\r\n\r\n[74] The ascent is of course most rapid, in the large tubes almost\r\ninstantaneous, when the capillary space is entirely clear; but in the\r\ncomplex system of connected air spaces in soils, the curved paths and\r\nthe friction obstruct the movement.\r\n\r\nThe coarse sandy soil reached its highest limit, 16½ inches, within six\r\ndays, when the silty Gila soil stood at about double that height.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 38.—Columns showing heights to which water will\r\nrise by capillarity in soils of different physical composition, and\r\nrates of ascent.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 39.—Capillary Rise of Water in Soil Sediments of\r\ndifferent Diameters.]\r\n\r\n_Ascent of Water in uniform_[75] _Sediments._—Loughridge has\r\nascertained the rate of ascent of uniform sediments of different\r\ngrain-diameters, with the results shown in the diagram subjoined,\r\ntogether with the maximum height reached by each. The diagram is very\r\neloquently illustrative of the great differences in the capillary\r\nproperties of granular sediments of the various grades; and it would\r\nseem that it ought to be possible to deduce from it by a somewhat\r\ncomplex formula the rate and height of ascent of water in any soil of\r\nknown physical composition. In nature, however, the presence of clay\r\nand the greater or less degree of flocculation of mixed sediments will\r\nalways vitiate to a very great extent the results deducible from such\r\ncalculations; hence the data conveyed by the observations of Loughridge\r\nmust be considered applicable only to granular sediments free from clay\r\nand entirely deflocculated.\r\n\r\n[75] I. e., uniform between the narrow limits given.\r\n\r\nIt is curious that in this case the “clay” showed a rise markedly below\r\nthat of the finest granular sediment, despite the extreme fineness of\r\nits particles. This proves plainly that the physical nature of colloid\r\nclay is unlike that of the granular sediments; as has been repeatedly\r\nmentioned above.\r\n\r\n_Maximum and Minimum of Water-holding Power._—It is clear that at\r\nthe base of the columns of soils just considered, the maximum of\r\nwater-absorption of which the soil is capable will have been brought\r\nabout; while at the top of the same column, the minimum of possible\r\nliquid absorption (continuous films of water) will exist. The same\r\nminimum moisture-condition will be produced when a limited quantity of\r\nwater is placed with a large mass of soil; the moisture will spread\r\nto certain limits, until the surface films of water have all acquired\r\nuniform tension; and will then cease to extend, except by evaporation\r\nand hygroscopic absorption.[76] It is clear that the same condition\r\nwill be brought about in the course of time at the top of a soil\r\ncolumn in which water has percolated from above; and hence the minimum\r\nmentioned, aside from evaporation, represents approximately the usual\r\ncondition of the soil near the surface within a variable time after a\r\nrain, or irrigation, when the descending water column has attained a\r\nlength corresponding to the height to which the water would have risen\r\nfrom below in a tube arranged as shown on p. 205. It is therefore a\r\ncondition of very frequent occurrence in the arid region.\r\n\r\n[76] Ad. Mayer (Agriculturchemie 2, p. 141) designates this minimum\r\ncontent of liquid water as the “absolute” water capacity of the same;\r\nbut it is not obvious wherein this factor is better entitled to this\r\nname than would be the maximum (see Wollny’s Forsch., 1892, p. 1.). M.\r\nWhitney (Rep. Proceedings Ass’n Agr. Coll. & Exp’t St’ns, Nov. 1904)\r\ngives as a new observation the fact that in soils approaching the\r\ndrought condition water “does not obey the ordinary physical laws as\r\nwe recognize them in capillarity.” This evidently refers simply to the\r\nwell-known phenomenon mentioned above.\r\n\r\n_Capillary Water held at Different Heights in a Soil Column._—To\r\ndetermine the amounts of water held in the different portions in\r\ncolumns of soils in which water ascends by capillary rise, the\r\nfollowing plan was adopted by the writer in collaboration with\r\nLoughridge (Rep. Calif. Sta. 1892-4, p. 99).\r\n\r\nInstead of glass tubes the soils to be tested were placed in copper\r\ntubes one inch in diameter, divided into segments six inches long,\r\nand flattened on one side. In the flattened side a slot half an inch\r\nwide was left, and glass plates, held in position by rubber elastics,\r\nwere cemented on the slotted side by means of paraffin, to prevent a\r\nsifting-out of the soil. The short sections can be connected at the\r\nends like joints of stove-pipe, and the earths can be easily introduced\r\nin proper, even condition. It was thus possible to gain access to any\r\nportion of the column at any time, for the taking of samples.\r\n\r\n        WATER CONTENTS OF SOIL COLUMNS AT VARIOUS HEIGHTS\r\n                          ABOVE WATER LEVEL.\r\n    ==================+===========+===============+================\r\n           No.        |    233    |     1197      |      1679\r\n    ------------------+-----------+---------------+----------------\r\n    Height above Water|Sandy Soil,|Sandy Alluvium,|Adobe, Berkeley.\r\n          Level.      |  Morano.  |     Gila.     |\r\n    ------------------+-----------+---------------+----------------\r\n        47 inches     |           |      4.33     |\r\n        42 inches     |           |     10.26     |\r\n        36 inches     |           |     11.99     |\r\n        30 inches     |           |     15.26     |\r\n        24 inches     |           |     21.39     |     10.26[77]\r\n        18 inches     |           |     27.63     |     29.48\r\n        12 inches     |    3.93   |     32.48     |     33.04\r\n         6 inches     |   14.15   |     35.04     |     38.47\r\n         3 inches     |           |               |     38.49\r\n         1 inch       |   24.34   |      36.64    |     44.41\r\n    ------------------+-----------+---------------+----------------\r\n\r\n[77] This figure represents only a temporary condition; the full height\r\nof 46 inches was not reached until the 195th day.\r\n\r\n    Since gravity limits the capillary ascent in a progressive\r\n    ratio, as shown in diagram 39, it is obvious that the true\r\n    _maximum_ saturation can exist only in a very short\r\n    (strictly speaking, an infinitesimally short) vertical\r\n    column. The least practicable height for experimental work\r\n    being about 1 cm. (⅖ in.), the writer has adopted for\r\n    the purpose of rapid determination of this factor, the\r\n    use of a brass cylinder 1 cm. high and of such width as\r\n    to contain, for the sake of convenience, 25 or 50 cm. of\r\n    soil. This cylinder has a finely perforated bottom, which\r\n    may be covered with filter paper; after being filled with\r\n    soil which has been struck level, and weighing, it is\r\n    immersed to 1 mm. depth in distilled water and allowed to\r\n    rest for an hour; then quickly dried outside and beneath\r\n    with filter paper, and again weighed. The amount of water\r\n    found by difference should for all practical purposes be\r\n    referred to the volume, not to the weight, of the soil, so\r\n    as to eliminate the error arising from the varying specific\r\n    gravity of the latter.\r\n\r\nIn most cases the surface of the soil in the sieve cylinder remains\r\nlevel after wetting; but sometimes it swells so as to rise above its\r\ndry level, even to the extent of nearly 30% (see chapter 7, p. 114).\r\nThis happens especially in strongly ferruginous soils. In the case of\r\n“black alkali” soils, in wetting an enormous _collapse_ sometimes takes\r\nplace (see chapter 22).\r\n\r\nIf it be desired to determine also the _minimum_ liquid absorption\r\n(see below), the surface of the wet soil is first covered with air-dry\r\nsoil, to absorb the surplus moisture, and finally with soil previously\r\nsaturated with hygroscopic moisture; the added soil being each time\r\nthrown off and finally the surface “struck” level with a tense silk\r\nthread before weighing. Corrections must be applied for the usual\r\nincrease in weight, from the addition of soil, and for the hygroscopic\r\nmoisture.\r\n\r\nWhile the _minimum_ of liquid absorption can thus be determined\r\nquickly, without awaiting the capillary ascent of a water column,\r\nand if sufficient time is given can also be determined in higher\r\ncolumns, as proposed by Mayer (Wollny’s Forsch. Vol. 3), the _maximum_\r\ncannot thus be determined without gross inaccuracy. In determinations\r\nmade by the writer it was found that the figures for the minima of\r\nvery different soils (clayey and sandy) of the arid region, differ\r\nproportionally much less than do the respective maxima. In few of these\r\nsoils it was found to exceed about 10 per cent, and it scarcely fell\r\nbelow 4 per cent even in very sandy soils. A very deep, sandy soil,\r\nwhich had been irrigated in May, and upon which no rain had since\r\nfallen, showed in July in the second foot, upon which rested ten inches\r\nof fully air-dried soil free from vegetation, a water-percentage of\r\neight per cent.[78]\r\n\r\n[78] Hall (The Soil, p. 66) gives for the minima in the case of soils\r\nexamined by him the following figures: coarse sandy soil, 22.2, light\r\nloam, 35.4, stiff clay, 45.6, sandy peat, 52.8. These figures are very\r\nmuch higher than for apparently similar materials used by the writer,\r\nand the differences exceed those between the maxima given for the same.\r\nThis discrepancy I am unable to account for.\r\n\r\n_Capillary Action in Moist Soils._—In the preceding discussion the case\r\nof columns of air-dry soils, so common in the arid regions, has been\r\nconsidered. It is obvious that a soil column holding the _minimum_ of\r\ncapillary water may be of any height; so that when, as happens in the\r\nopen field, the rain water soaks down beyond the range of capillary\r\nrise in a given soil, the upper portions of the latter, above that\r\nrange, will remain at the minimum of moisture-content so long as it is\r\nnot depleted by evaporation. King has made extended observations on\r\nsoil columns ten feet high and moistened throughout the mass. Capillary\r\nmovement takes place in moist soils much more rapidly than in dry ones,\r\nalthough when sufficient time is given the final adjustment will of\r\ncourse be the same. King’s experiments showed that evaporation at the\r\nsurface of the tenfoot columns caused a sensible depletion of the water\r\ncontent originally existing at the depth of ten feet, in the course of\r\n314 days. While so slow a movement might not be of any benefit during\r\nthe growth-period of shallow-rooted annual crops, the fact shown is of\r\nimportance to permanent plantings, as of trees and vines.\r\n\r\nAnother and not so readily intelligible effect observed by King is that\r\nwhen the surface-soil is wetted, moisture may be withdrawn toward the\r\nsurface from the lower layers. In one experiment he found that when\r\nwater was applied on the surface so as to add two pounds of water to\r\n_each_ surface foot in several soils, at the end of 26 hours there had\r\nbeen an increase of _three_ pounds in the same, and a loss of one and\r\nthree quarter pounds from the second and third feet. The cause of this\r\ntranslocation is probably a “distillation” of the subsoil moisture\r\ntoward the cooled soil; the fact that it occurs is of practical\r\ninterest, since it seems to show that wetting the upper portion of the\r\nsoil by cold rain or irrigation may tend to raise additional supplies\r\nfrom below. At the change of seasons we not uncommonly find, in digging\r\ntree holes or wells, a wet streak at from 9 to 18 inches below the\r\nsurface, caused evidently by the condensation of subsoil moisture, at\r\nthe limit of a cold zone resulting from the penetration of unseasonable\r\ntemperature (“cold snap”) from above. Such movements of soil-moisture\r\nby means of evaporation and recondensation within the soil can of\r\ncourse take place even when the minimum of liquid absorption has been\r\nreached and direct capillary movement has ceased. It is, as it were,\r\ndew within the soil.\r\n\r\n_Proportion of Moisture Available to Growing Plants._—Not all the\r\ncapillary moisture contained in soils is available to plants, as can\r\nreadily be seen from the fact that many plants, especially when growing\r\nin pots, begin to wilt while the soil still appears visibly moist. The\r\nlimit of wilting differs greatly in different plants, and in the open\r\nground it is difficult to ascertain that limit, because the deeper\r\nroots continue to supply moisture from moister substrata. Hence potted\r\nplants wilt while the soil appears much moister than when the same grow\r\nin the field. King[79] has determined the amounts of moisture down to\r\n43 inches in a Wisconsin soil in which clover and corn were at the\r\nwilting point, as in the following condensed table:\r\n\r\n    ===============================+=========+========+========\r\n                                   | Clover. | Maize. | Fallow\r\n                                   |         |        | ground.\r\n    -------------------------------+---------+--------+--------\r\n    First 12 inches, clay loam     |   8.44  |   7.03 |  17.01\r\n    Second 12 inches, reddish clay |  12.84  |  11.79 |  19.86\r\n    24 to 30 inches, sandy clay    |  13.52  |  10.84 |  18.56\r\n    40 to 43 inches, sand          |   9.53  |   4.17 |  15.90\r\n    -------------------------------+---------+--------+--------\r\n\r\n[79] Physics of Agriculture, p. 135.\r\n\r\nIt is plainly shown here that the roots of clover and corn were unable\r\nto utilize the higher moisture-content of the subsoil-clay to the same\r\nextent as the smaller amounts present in the surface foot, and in the\r\nsandy substrata. Evidently the moisture in the clay soil was more\r\ntenaciously retained.\r\n\r\nThis is doubtless due, as King shows, to the equal thinness of the\r\nmoisture film remaining on the soil grains in either case; the number\r\nof grains, and therefore the aggregate surface holding these films,\r\nbeing much greater in the clay than in sands; hence the higher water\r\ncontent.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to compare these figures given by King for clover\r\nand maize at the wilting-point, and fallow ground adjacent, with those\r\ngiven by Eckart (Rep. Expt. Sta. Haw. Sugar Planters’ Ass’n., 1903) for\r\nthose affording good growing conditions for sugar-cane on the (highly\r\nferruginous) soils of that station. The plots were irrigated at the\r\nrate of one, two and three inches of water per week, allowance being\r\nmade for the rainfall. Two inches proved, on the whole, to give the\r\nbest average results for production. The moisture determination of\r\nthe soil under the two-inch regime gave an average moisture content\r\nof 29.13% in the first foot of soil. It is not stated what was the\r\nhygroscopic coefficient of that soil, but it was probably very high;\r\nin the neighborhood of 21.5%, judging by the determinations made with\r\nsix Hawaiian soils at the California Station. This would indicate about\r\n7.63% of free moisture as the optimum for sugar-cane.\r\n\r\n_Moisture-requirements of Crops in the Arid Region._—Plants\r\n(particularly broad-leaved ones) which have made a brash growth during\r\na period of abundant moisture, will wilt quickly when sunshine returns,\r\nand take some time to adapt themselves to the drier conditions. On the\r\nother hand, plants accustomed to dry air and scanty soil-moisture,\r\nwill not wilt or suffer under what would elsewhere be considered very\r\nrigorous conditions. Loughridge[80] has made numerous determinations of\r\nmoisture in soils in which crops were beginning to suffer, and others\r\non similar soils that were growing normally, and found that in general,\r\nnot only were the differences in moisture content considerably less\r\nthan in the case above quoted from King’s observations, but that the\r\namounts of free moisture required by various crops in the arid climate\r\nof California were surprisingly small.\r\n\r\n[80] Rept. Cal. Expt. Sta. 1897-08, pp. 65-96.\r\n\r\nThe tables below show the results of observations made by Loughridge\r\nduring several drought years in California; so arranged as to show the\r\ndifferences of moisture content for the same crop in different soils.\r\nIt will be observed that in all cases where a crop growing on a clay\r\nsoil could be compared with the same on a lighter soil, the moisture\r\nrequired to keep the crop in good condition was very much greater\r\nin the clay than in the loam or sandy soils. In the case of apples,\r\n_e. g._, 8.3% of water was abundant to keep the trees in excellent\r\ncondition on a loam soil, while on a clay soil holding 12.3% the\r\ncondition was very poor. That this difference is due in the main to the\r\ndifference in the hygroscopic-moisture coefficient of the respective\r\nsoils, is plainly apparent in several cases. It is therefore not the\r\n_total_ moisture content, but the free moisture present in excess of\r\nwhat is held by hygroscopic absorption, that determines the welfare of\r\nthe plant.\r\n\r\nBy determining, first, the total moisture in the soils, as taken in\r\nthe field, then, after allowing them to become air-dry, determining\r\nthe maximum of hygroscopic moisture they would absorb (see p. 198),\r\nLoughridge found by difference the amount of free moisture, or liquid\r\nwater which must be present in the soil to prevent the crops from\r\nsuffering. An exceptionally good opportunity for these observations\r\nwas offered by the dry season of 1898, during which crops suffering\r\nand not suffering, on identical lands, could easily be found. The\r\ndeterminations were always made for each foot of the upper four feet\r\nof the land in the immediate neighborhood of the trees or among the\r\nfield crops. The first table exemplifies the method of procedure; the\r\nsecond gives the summary of results for the several crops and trees, as\r\ncalculated from observations made during the season.\r\n\r\n        TABLE SHOWING CONDITION OF CROPS ON VARIOUS SOILS UNDER\r\n                     DIFFERENT MOISTURE-CONDITIONS.\r\n     ============+=============+=========+==============================\r\n                 |             |         |Per cent Moisture in four feet.\r\n      Kind of    |  Kind of    |Condition+------+------------+-----+----\r\n       Crop.     |   Soil.     |   of    |      |            |     |Tons\r\n                 |             |  Crop.  |Total.|Hygroscopic.|Free.| per\r\n                 |             |         |      |            |     |acre.\r\n     ------------+-------------+---------+------+------------+-----+----\r\n     Wheat       |Very sandy   |Poor     |  2.6 |     1.9    |  .7 |  56\r\n       “         |Sandy loam   |Good     | 12.8 |     5.6    | 7.2 | 576\r\n       “         |Clay         |Dead     | 14.1 |    10.5    | 3.6 | 288\r\n     Maize       |Clay adobe   |Very good| 12.9 |     8.8    | 4.1 | 328\r\n       “         |Sandy loam   |Fair     |  6.1 |     2.3    | 3.8 | 304\r\n     Barley      |Black adobe  |Wilting  | 10.7 |     8.8    | 1.9 | 152\r\n     Sugar Beets |Black loam   |Good     | 12.4 |     5.6    | 6.8 | 544\r\n     Vines       |Loam         |Good     |  8.5 |     5.0    | 3.5 | 280\r\n       “         |Sandy loam   |Poor     |  1.9 |     1.5    |  .4 |  32\r\n     Almonds     |Loam         |Good     |  8.5 |     6.6    | 1.9 | 178\r\n        “        |Same field   |Suffering|  7.9 |     6.9    | 1.0 |  80\r\n     Apples      |Loam         |Excellent|  8.3 |     5.5    | 2.8 | 224\r\n       “         |Clay         |Poor     | 12.3 |    10.8    | 1.5 | 120\r\n     Apricots    |Loam         |Excellent|  6.3 |     3.3    | 3.0 | 240\r\n        “        |Gravelly loam|Poor     |  6.9 |     5.0    | 1.9 | 152\r\n     Figs        |Red loam     |Good     |  5.2 |     3.8    | 1.4 | 112\r\n      “          |Heavy loam   |Wilting  |  8.6 |     8.6    | 0   |   0\r\n     Olives      |Red loam     |Good     |  5.2 |     3.8    | 1.4 | 112\r\n       “         |Sandy loam   |Suffering|  1.9 |     1.9    | 0   |   0\r\n     Peaches     |Red loam     |Good     |  8.2 |     5.0    | 3.2 | 256\r\n        “        |   “         |Poor     |  6.8 |     5.0    | 1.8 | 144\r\n     Prunes      |Gray loam    |Excellent| 11.2 |     9.0    | 2.2 | 176\r\n       “         |    “        |Poor     |  6.4 |     5.4    | 1.0 |  80\r\n    Citrus fruits|Sandy loam   |Good     |  6.3 |     3.1    | 3.2 | 256\r\n       “      “  |Sandy soil   |Leafless |  3.1 |     2.4    |  .7 |  56\r\n     ------------+-------------+---------+------+------------+-----+----\r\n\r\n    TABLE SHOWING DROUGHT-ENDURANCE OF VARIOUS CROPS IN ARID REGION.\r\n    ===================+=========================+====================\r\n    Free water in four |                         |\r\n        feet of soil.  | Crops that did well in  |Crops that suffered\r\n    ----------+--------+    lowest amount of     |in highest amount of\r\n              |  Tons  |   moisture mentioned    |moisture mentioned\r\n     Per cent.|   per  |    in first column.     |in first column.\r\n              |  acre. |                         |\r\n    ----------+--------+-------------------------+--------------------\r\n    0 to 1.0  |    80 {|Apricots, Olives, Grapes,|Citrus, Pears,\r\n              |       {|Peaches, Soy-bean.       | Plums, Acacia.\r\n              |        |                         |\r\n    1.0 to 1.5|   120  |Citrus, Figs.            |Almonds, Apples.\r\n    1.5 to 2. |   160  |Almonds, Plums, Saltbush.|Barley.\r\n    2   to 2.5| { 176  |Prunes.                  |\r\n              | { 200  |Walnuts, Eucalyptus.     |Prunes.\r\n    2.5 to 3  |   224  |Apples.                  |\r\n    3   to 3.5|   288  |Pears.                   |\r\n    3   to 4  |   322  |Hairy Vetch.             |Wheat.\r\n    4   to 5  |   400  |Wheat, Maize.            |\r\n    5   to 6  |   480  |Sugar beets, Sorghum.    |Sugar beets.\r\n    ----------+--------+-------------------------+--------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nTHE WATER OF SOILS.—_Continued._\r\n\r\nSURFACE, HYDROSTATIC AND GROUND WATER; PERCOLATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince all the water of soils and plants is directly or indirectly\r\nderived from the rainfall (including therein snow and hail), some\r\ngeneral points regarding this factor require first consideration. While\r\nit is not the object of this work to discuss climatology in detail,\r\nyet the times of the year and the manner in which precipitation comes,\r\nacts upon and is disposed of in the soil under different climatic\r\nconditions, must of necessity form an essential part of its subject\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n_Amount of rainfall._—The rain falling in the course of a year is\r\nusually stated in the form of “inches” (or centimeters), implying\r\nthe height of the water column that would be shown at the end of the\r\nyear had it all been allowed to accumulate; or, the sum of all the\r\nsuccessive rains (including snow) observed during the year. Since\r\nthis amount ranges all the way from nothing, or a mere fraction of an\r\ninch (as in portions of the Andes, and of the great African and Asian\r\ndeserts) to as much as 600 inches or fifty feet (Cherapundji in eastern\r\nIndia), the adaptation of agricultural practice to the maintenance\r\nof the proper moisture-supply to crops is largely a local question,\r\noftentimes of not inconsiderable difficulty. This is especially the\r\ncase where torrential rains, yielding several inches of rain in a few\r\nhours, alternate with light, soaking rainfall, as is very commonly\r\nthe case in the interior of continents, and more especially in the\r\nUnited States east of the Rocky Mountains. Westward of the same the\r\nrainfall decreases so rapidly that at or about the one-hundredth\r\nmeridian (the longitude of Bismark and Pierre, Dakota, and Dodge City,\r\nKansas) we already reach the annual average of 20 inches, which is\r\ncommonly assumed to be the limit below which crops cannot safely be\r\ngrown without irrigation. The “cloudbursts” occasionally occurring\r\nwithin these limits are usually confined to mountainous regions, and\r\nthe water they pour down on the dry soil is rarely of any direct\r\nbenefit to agriculture; hence they cannot be properly counted in the\r\ngeneral estimate of the effective rainfall. A region of high rainfall\r\n(up to 100 inches and over), however, extends along the Pacific coast\r\nfrom northern California through western Oregon and Washington across\r\nBritish Columbia to Alaska, to seaward of the Sierra Nevada, Cascade,\r\nand Alaskan coast ranges.\r\n\r\nIn the country east of the Mississippi river, the average annual\r\nrainfall ranges from 30 inches in the region of the Great Lakes, and\r\n45 to 50 inches on the north Atlantic coast, to 60 inches in Louisiana\r\nand up to eighty in southern Florida. The average of the Mississippi\r\nValley and Atlantic coast States is usually stated at about 45 inches,\r\nwhich is distributed more or less evenly throughout the year, excepting\r\nusually from six to eight weeks of more scanty precipitation in the\r\nlatter part of August and in September—the “Indian summer” season; so\r\nthat the winter is the season of greatest total rainfall.\r\n\r\n_Natural disposition of the Rain Water._—The rainfall is naturally\r\nfirst disposed of in two ways, viz., a portion which is absorbed by\r\nthe soil, and another which is at once shed from the surface and\r\nconstitutes the “surface runoff.” The portion absorbed into the soil\r\nis subsequently disposed of either by soakage downward into the\r\nsubdrainage and through springs and seepage[81] into the streams and\r\nrivers; or by evaporation. The latter again occurs in two different\r\nways, viz., from the soil-surface itself, or through the roots and\r\nleaves of plants. The importance of each of these modes is sufficiently\r\ngreat to entitle each to detailed consideration.\r\n\r\n_The Surface Runoff._—This portion of the disposal of rain may range\r\nall the way from nothing to almost totality, according to the nature of\r\nthe soil and the condition of its surface.[82] Sandy soils, especially\r\nwhen coarse, may absorb instantly even a very heavy rainfall. Heavy\r\nclay soils when dry will at first also absorb quickly quite a heavy\r\nprecipitation; but as the beating of the raindrops compacts the\r\nsurface, the absorption quickly slows down, so that heavy downpours of\r\nbrief duration, while wetting thoroughly into a plastic mass the first\r\ntwo or three inches of a clay soil, may leave all beneath dry, to be\r\nvery gradually moistened by the slow downward percolation against the\r\nresistance of the air in the soil; while the greater part of the later\r\nportion of the shower will drain off the surface in muddy runlets.\r\nCertain soils classed as loams, having the property of crusting readily\r\nby rain followed by sunshine (see chapter 7, p. 111), in heavy showers\r\nbehave hardly better than strong clay soils; shedding the water until\r\nthe soaked crust gives way, and is carried off in muddy streamlets.\r\nThen begins the cutting-away of the soil that, in portions of the\r\nCotton States, as well as north of the Ohio river, has been the cause\r\nof extensive devastation of once fruitful culture lands, the site of\r\nwhich is now marked by “red washes” and gullies but too familiar to the\r\neye in many regions, especially of the southern United States.\r\n\r\n[81] The quiet seepage from the banks and beds of streams plays a much\r\nmore important part in the increase of volume of flow than is commonly\r\nsupposed, because unperceived save by measurement of the tributaries\r\nand comparison with the main streams. This is especially true of the\r\ndrainage in the arid region, where the deep and pervious soils favor\r\ndiffuse seepage as against definite spring flow.\r\n\r\n[82] Toumey (Yearbook U. S. Dep’t Agr. 1903) states that in the San\r\nBernardino mountains in southern California, the first rainfall (in\r\nDecember) was absorbed to the extent of 95% in forested areas, against\r\nonly 60% in the non-forested; but that later, after the soil had been\r\npartially saturated, 60% only was absorbed in the forested land,\r\nagainst 5% in the non-forested. While it is generally admitted that\r\nforests diminish the runoff, Rafter (Relation of Rainfall to Runoff, U.\r\nS. Geol. Survey Paper, No. 80, p. 53) contends that in New York State\r\nthe reverse is true.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 40.—Erosion in Mississippi Table Lands, causing\r\ndestruction of agricultural value both of Uplands and Valleys. (McGee,\r\n12th Ann. Rept. U. S., 1890-91.)]\r\n\r\n    _Washing-away and Gullying in the Cotton\r\n    States._—Nowhere perhaps have these effects been so\r\n    severely felt as in portions of northwestern and central\r\n    Mississippi, and this case is so instructive as to deserve\r\n    a more detailed description. In the regions in question the\r\n    soil stratum consists of a yellow or brownish loam from\r\n    three to seven feet in original thickness, constituting a\r\n    very desirable class of gently rolling uplands, which at\r\n    one time claimed to be the best cotton-growing portion of\r\n    the State. It was originally covered with an open forest\r\n    of oaks, with an abundant growth of grasses that afforded\r\n    excellent pasture to deer and cattle; a natural park gay\r\n    with flowers during most of the season.\r\n\r\n    When these lands were taken into cultivation little or no\r\n    attention was paid to the direction of the furrows and rows\r\n    of corn and cotton; most commonly the plowing was done\r\n    “up-hill and down,” so that the “dead-furrow” afforded\r\n    a ready opportunity for the formation of washes cutting\r\n    into the subsoil, during the torrential rains sometimes\r\n    falling during the summers. Even when filled with soil by\r\n    plowing, these washes would frequently re-open during rains,\r\n    shedding the soil in a muddy flood upon the lower lands. The\r\n    washing-away of the surface soil, thus brought about, of\r\n    course diminished the production of the higher lands, which\r\n    were then commonly “turned out” and left without cultivation\r\n    or care of any kind. The crusted surface shed the rain water\r\n    into the old furrows, and the latter were quickly deepened\r\n    and widened into gullies—“red washes”—whose presence\r\n    rendered any resumption of cultivation difficult. In the\r\n    course of a few years the soil-stratum of brown loam was\r\n    penetrated into the loose or loosely cemented sand which\r\n    underlies it almost everywhere, and is very readily washed\r\n    away. Soon the water, gaining yearly in volume, undercut the\r\n    loam stratum so as to cause it to “cave” into gullies in\r\n    huge masses, which with the sand were carried into the\r\n    valleys adjacent, filling the beds of the streams so as to\r\n    cause their flow to disappear under the flood of sand. As\r\n    the evil progressed, large areas of uplands were denuded\r\n    completely of their loam or culture stratum, leaving nothing\r\n    but bare, arid sand, wholly useless for cultivation; while\r\n    the valleys were little better, the native vegetation having\r\n    been destroyed and only hardy weeds finding nourishment on\r\n    the sandy surface.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 40a.—Erosion in Mississippi Table Lands, causing\r\ndestruction of agricultural value both of Uplands and Valleys. (McGee,\r\n12th Ann. Rept. U. S. G. S., 1890-91.)]\r\n\r\n    In this manner whole sections, and in some portions of the\r\n    State whole townships of the best class of uplands have\r\n    been transformed into sandy wastes, hardly reclaimable by\r\n    any ordinary means, and wholly changing the industrial\r\n    conditions of entire counties; whose county seats even in\r\n    some instances had to be changed, the old town and site\r\n    having, by the same destructive agencies, literally “gone\r\n    down hill.” This destruction of lands was greatly aggravated\r\n    by the civil war, during which, and for some time after,\r\n    large areas of lands once under cultivation were left to the\r\n    mercy of the elements.\r\n\r\n_Injury in the arid regions._—In the arid regions, where the rainfall\r\nfrequently comes in heavy downpours or “cloudbursts,” immense damage\r\nto pasture lands has been brought about by overstocking, in Arizona\r\nand New Mexico; involving the destruction of the natural cover of\r\nvegetation and the loosening of the surface especially by sheep; after\r\nwhich a heavy rainfall will carry off the surface soil, the muddy water\r\nbeing gathered largely in the trails made by cattle going to water.\r\nThus gradually gullies are formed, which enlarging more and more become\r\nravines and cut up the pasture slopes into “bad lands,” useless equally\r\nfor pasture and for agriculture.[83] California, eastern Oregon and\r\nWashington, and Montana, offer striking and lamentable examples of the\r\nsame destructive agencies.\r\n\r\n[83] Open Range and Irrigation Farming. R. H Forbes, in Forester, Nos.\r\n7, 9, 1902.\r\n\r\n_Deforestation._—The deforestation of hill and mountain lands has, the\r\nworld over, led to similar results; causing not only the destruction\r\nof pasture and agricultural lands, but also the conversion of streams,\r\nflowing from springs and seepage all the year, into periodic torrents,\r\nflooding the lowlands during rains by the rapid running-off of the\r\nwater from the bare and hard-baked mountain slopes, and then running\r\ndry within a short time, so as not even to afford drinking water to\r\npasturing cattle in summer. Thus for half a century the unsolved\r\nproblem of the “correction of the waters of the Jura mountains” was\r\nbefore the Swiss and French governments; and the great and costly\r\npublic work involving re-forestation, deflection of torrents and\r\nfilling-in of deep ravines and gullies, is not even yet nearly\r\ncompleted. In Spain, which in the time of the Roman occupation was\r\nlargely a forest country with abundant rainfall, the same results are\r\nseen, notably in the South, in the wide, and mostly dry, sandy beds\r\nof streams once running deep and clear; and in the scarred hill-and\r\nmountain-sides, and scant vegetation of low shrubs (“chaparral”) that\r\nreplace the once abundant tree growth, _e. g._, in Old and New Castile.\r\nUnfortunately the lessons taught by the bitter experience of the old\r\nworld seem to require actual repetition in the new, before means of\r\nprevention are even thought of.\r\n\r\n_Prevention of Injury to Cultivated Lands from excessive Runoff._—The\r\nfundamental remedy for the injurious effects of excessive runoff from\r\nthe land surface is, of course, to facilitate its absorption into the\r\nsoil to the utmost extent possible, by deep tillage; or in cases where\r\nthis is undesirable (as when in rainy climates excessive leaching of\r\nthe land is feared), to so direct and control the surface drainage\r\nthat its flow shall nowhere be so rapid as to carry with it any large\r\namounts of earth, or to wash out the furrows. To this end its fall must\r\nbe diminished by “circling,” _i. e._, plowing nearly at right angles\r\nto the slope instead of up-and-down, and on steep slopes especially\r\nalso by maintaining open furrows or ditches having a gentle fall only,\r\ninto which the water can shed and flow off quietly in case the furrows,\r\nleft in plowing, prove insufficient to retain and shed gradually the\r\nwater they cannot hold permanently. The early adoption of this simple\r\nexpedient would have wholly prevented the enormous waste of fine\r\nagricultural lands referred to above.\r\n\r\nThe underdraining of lands liable to washing is a costly but highly\r\neffective means of preventing denudation; and the laying of underdrains\r\nin gullies already formed, to prevent farther deepening, is among the\r\nmost obvious means of arresting farther damage. The beneficial effects\r\nof underdrainage in conserving moisture will be discussed farther on.\r\n\r\n\r\nABSORPTION AND MOVEMENTS OF WATER IN SOILS.\r\n\r\nThe phenomena and laws of capillary ascent of water in soils, as\r\ndiscussed in the preceding chapter, serve best to demonstrate the\r\ngeneral behavior of liquid water within different soils and their\r\nseveral grain-sizes; because measurably independent of the physical\r\nchanges that almost unavoidably accompany the percolation of water\r\nfrom above downward; whether such water comes in the form of rain,\r\nor irrigation, or even when applied with the utmost precautions in\r\nthe laboratory. The “beating” of rains quickly compacts the surface\r\nto a certain extent, varying with the nature of the soil, its\r\ncondition of more or less perfect tilth, and the degree of violence\r\nwith which the rain strikes the surface. When the latter has been\r\ncompacted by a previous rain and then dried, “baking” or incrusting\r\nthe surface, the latter may almost wholly shed a rain of brief\r\nduration, which, had the surface been loose, would have been wholly\r\nabsorbed, materially benefiting the crop. Such surface-crusting is,\r\ntherefore, injurious in preventing the absorption of water from above;\r\nand in addition, it serves to waste, by evaporation, the moisture\r\ncontained in the underlying soil and subsoil. For the crust being of\r\na finer (single-grain) texture than the tilled portion beneath, it\r\nwill forcibly abstract from the latter, by absorption, its capillary\r\nmoisture, and evaporating it at the upper surface, continue to deplete\r\nthe land, to the great injury of crop growth, until destroyed by\r\ncultivation.[84]\r\n\r\n[84] This effect is well illustrated by the behavior of a dry brick\r\nlaid upon a wet sponge. It will quickly absorb all the liquid moisture\r\ncontained in the latter, while the sponge will be wholly unable to take\r\nany moisture from a fully-soaked brick.\r\n\r\nThe flow of irrigation water produces the same compacting effect, but\r\nto a less extent; the more as, unlike rain water, irrigation water\r\nusually contains a certain amount of alkaline and earth salts, which\r\ntend to prevent the diffusion of clay and of fine sediments, and\r\ntherefore the disintegration of the soil-floccules into single grains.\r\nNevertheless, it is in some soils as necessary to cultivate after\r\nsurface-irrigation as after rains, in order to prevent great waste of\r\nmoisture by evaporation.\r\n\r\n_Determination of rate of percolation._—When water is allowed to\r\nsoak into an air-dry soil column without sensible shock or motion,\r\nfrom a constant level, we obtain the nearest approach to a definite\r\ndetermination of the relative permeability of soils to water under\r\nthe conditions usual in the arid region. A number of determinations\r\nthus made is tabulated in the diagram given below, which embodies the\r\nobservations made by Mr. A. V. Stubenrauch[85] in connection with a\r\nmore extended investigation.\r\n\r\n[85] Rep’t Calif. Exp’t Station for 1898 to 1901, p. 165.\r\n\r\n    As these experiments were made with soils not in their\r\n    field condition, but gently broken up with a rubber pestle,\r\n    a standard of compactness was established by weighing the\r\n    quantity which could conveniently be settled into a tube\r\n    space of 100 centimeters capacity by tapping the sides and\r\n    bottom of the tube, without touching the soil itself. In\r\n    this way the following standards were established: For the\r\n    University Adobe soil, 140 grams; for the Yuba loam soil,\r\n    110 grams; for the Stanislaus sandy soil, 170 grams. Tubes\r\n    1½ inches wide were used, and the soils were introduced\r\n    in bulk, inside of a cylinder of stiff paper upon which\r\n    previously to rolling it up the soils had been thoroughly\r\n    mixed. After introducing the soil-filled paper roll it\r\n    was gently withdrawn, leaving the soil column in the tube\r\n    as uniform as before; a condition almost impossible of\r\n    fulfilment when the soil is introduced piece-meal. The tubes\r\n    were, of course, left open at the lower end, using a wire\r\n    netting to keep the soil column in, so that the air could\r\n    escape freely before the descending water column.\r\n\r\n    The results thus obtained do not, of course, apply directly\r\n    to the same soils undisturbed in place in the field; where,\r\n    moreover, the air is confined by the wetting of the surface\r\n    and thus directly opposes penetration of the water. Still,\r\n    they doubtless give a correct idea of their _relative_\r\n    permeability for water when in the tilled condition. The\r\n    water level was automatically maintained at the depth\r\n    of half an inch above the surface of the soil columns.\r\n    Pore-spaces given are calculated from volume-weight and\r\n    specific gravity.\r\n\r\nThis diagram shows plainly that there is no direct relation between\r\nthe total pore-space in a soil and the facility of water-penetration.\r\nThe highest pore-space, in the fine-grained alluvial loam, allows more\r\nrapid percolation than the heavy clay or adobe soil, but is greatly\r\nexceeded by the coarser sandy soil. In all it is very apparent that the\r\ndownward movement slows down as the water descends, doubtless because\r\nthe great friction in a longer column gradually diminishes the effect\r\nof hydrostatic pressure. It may be presumed that at a certain distance\r\nfrom the surface the downward movement becomes practically uniform, and\r\nindependent of the pressure from above.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 41.—Diagram showing differences in rates of\r\npercolation through different soils.]\r\n\r\n_Summary._—Two salient points are revealed by even a cursory inspection\r\nof the preceding diagram, viz.:\r\n\r\n1. The downward percolation is most rapid in the same soils in which\r\nthe capillary ascent is quickest, that is, in the coarse, sandy soil.\r\n\r\n2. The rapidity of percolation decreases materially as the wetted soil\r\ncolumn increases in length.\r\n\r\n    The first point is readily foreseen and needs no comment.\r\n    As regards the second, it results from the fact that as\r\n    the wetted column lengthens the frictional resistance\r\n    increasingly counteracts the effects of the hydrostatic\r\n    pressure from above, until the water’s descent becomes but\r\n    little more rapid than would be its lateral diffusion,\r\n    or its ascent at the end of a similar column supplied by\r\n    capillary rise from below. In both cases the frictional\r\n    resistance has so far counteracted the effect of gravity\r\n    that the capillary coefficients of the soil-material become\r\n    the controlling factors of the water movement.\r\n\r\n_Influence of Variety of Grain-sizes._—King (Physics of Agriculture,\r\npp. 159, 160), compared the rapidity of the percolation of water\r\nthrough definitely graded pure sands on the one hand, and a sandy loam\r\nand a clay soil on the other. The materials were arranged in 8-foot\r\ncolumns fully saturated with water at the outset, and then allowed\r\nto drain freely. The following abridged table shows the tenor of his\r\nresults:\r\n\r\n    TABLE SHOWING RELATIVE RAPIDITY OF PERCOLATION IN PURE\r\n       SANDS AND SOILS, IN INCHES OF WATER DRAINED OFF.\r\n    ===================+==================+==============+============\r\n    Diameter of Uniform|       First      |    Second    |   Total\r\n       Sand Grains.    |    30 minutes.   | 30 minutes.  |in one hour.\r\n    -------------------+------------------+--------------+------------\r\n         .475 mm.      |      10.25       |     4.68     |   14.93\r\n         .155  “       |       5.67       |     4.52     |   10.19\r\n         .083  “       |       1.21       |      .85     |    2.06\r\n    ===================+===========+======+===+==========+============\r\n                       |First 21-23| First 10 |Second 10 |  Total in\r\n          Soils.       |  hours.   |   days   |   days   |   about\r\n                       |           |following.|following.| 505 hours.\r\n    -------------------+-----------+----------+----------+------------\r\n    Sandy loam         |   2.64    |   5.07   |   .91    |    8.62\r\n    Clay loam          |   1.96    |   2.11   |   .49    |    4.56\r\n    -------------------+-----------+----------+----------+------------\r\n\r\nThis table is very instructive in showing the great difference in the\r\nrapidity of percolation in materials of uniform, even-sized grains,\r\nas compared with such as contain particles of many different sizes,\r\nin which the interspaces of the larger ones are filled more or less\r\nclosely by the smaller sizes of particles (see chapter 7, p. 109).\r\nWhile it is true that we have no definite physical analysis of the\r\nsoils here used, the differences are so great as to be sufficiently\r\nstriking. Compare the percolation through the sand of .155 mm. uniform\r\ngrain-size (a fine sand), during the first half hour, with that through\r\nthe sandy loam during the first 21 hours. Twice as much water has\r\npassed from the sand as from the soil in one forty-second part of the\r\ntime. Comparing similarly the finest sand, .083 mm. in diameter, with\r\nthe clay loam, we find the difference to be as one to seventy-three.\r\nIt is thus evident that but for the variously assorted sizes of the\r\nsoil-particles, water would not be held long enough to supply plant\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\n_Percolation in Natural Soils._—In artificial percolation experiments,\r\nas well as during a fall of rain, the gradual settling of the fully\r\nwetted soil-column produces a compacting of that portion of the mass,\r\nthat increasingly impedes the downward penetration. The effect of this\r\nunder natural conditions is readily seen in the fact that after the\r\nfirst, rapid absorption of falling rain by the soil when in good tilth,\r\nthere is a gradual slackening of the process even when the rain is fine\r\nand slow, causing a perceptible increase of the runoff until, should\r\nthe rain continue for some time, the absorption becomes so slow as to\r\ncause all, or nearly all the water to drain off the surface. The soil\r\nis then called “saturated,” having really arrived at that point right\r\nat the surface, and to a depth varying according to the duration and\r\namount of rain, and the natural perviousness of the land.\r\n\r\nWhen the rain ceases, the visible saturation of the surface usually\r\nsoon disappears in cultivated soils, and the zone of saturation begins\r\nto descend. The progress of this descent may be very strikingly\r\nobserved in a series of holes (post-holes) dug or bored across a\r\nridge; as indicated in the subjoined schematic diagram, in which the\r\nsuccessive dotted lines represent the levels of the descending “bottom\r\nwater” at successive intervals, as derived from the observation of the\r\nwater levels in the several holes.[86]\r\n\r\n[86] The exact record of these observations was unfortunately destroyed\r\nby fire; the soil was a heavy clay, and it took ten days before the\r\nwater disappeared from the lowest hole.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 42.—Percolation in clay land after heavy rain.]\r\n\r\n    It will be seen that while at first the upper surface of\r\n    the zone of saturation coincides with the surface of the\r\n    ground, in falling it descends most rapidly on the highest\r\n    ground, while at the lower levels the holes may remain full\r\n    or overflowing; the drainage taking place sideways as well\r\n    as vertically. The curved surface connecting the levels in\r\n    the several holes gradually flattens, rapidly at first, then\r\n    progressively more slowly; the water disappearing entirely,\r\n    first from the holes lying highest, then successively from\r\n    those at lower levels; those located in valleys or drainage\r\n    channels remaining full until surface-water ceases to run\r\n    in such channels. But even after liquid water has ceased to\r\n    be visible in the holes, the descent of the water continues\r\n    within that portion of the soil, tending (unless more rain\r\n    should come before that time), to establish the condition\r\n    of equilibrium as existing in the soil columns shown in\r\n    the diagram on p. 205, chapt. 11; such as results from the\r\n    capillary ascent of water from below, but having above it a\r\n    column of soil of minimum water-content, of greater or less\r\n    height according to the length of time allowed for the water\r\n    to descend. This is a very common state of things during the\r\n    long summer droughts in the arid region, when neither rain\r\n    nor irrigation has added to the water supply in the soil for\r\n    many months, and yet ordinary deciduous fruit trees mature\r\n    their normal crops. Frequently, however, before this state\r\n    of equilibrium is reached, evaporation from the surface so\r\n    draws upon the water supply within the first few feet, as to\r\n    reduce the soil to undersaturation at the lowest point of\r\n    the descending column, so stopping farther descent and soon\r\n    reversing the direction of the movement. The latter is the\r\n    usual condition of scantily irrigated ground.\r\n\r\n_Ground or Bottom Water, Water Table._—During and after long-continued\r\nand abundant rains, the zone of supersaturation continues to descend\r\nuntil it finally reaches a more or less permanent level, varying\r\nsomewhat from season to season, but on the whole usually definable for\r\neach region and locality; being the depth to which wells must be sunk\r\nin order to secure a fairly permanent water supply. This is called\r\nthe water table, ground water, bottom water, or “first water.”[87]\r\nThe proportion of the rainfall that reaches the permanent water level\r\nvaries enormously, of course, in different soils and at different\r\ntimes. With brief and moderate rains, in soils of high water-holding\r\npower and slow percolation, it may never reach the bottom-water level;\r\nthis is very commonly the case in the arid regions. Where, as in the\r\nhumid regions, rains are frequent or much prolonged, one half and even\r\nmore may finally reach the permanent level; runoff and evaporation\r\ndisposing of the balance.\r\n\r\n[87] In contradistinction to other levels or “streams” of water which\r\nmay usually be found lower down, separated from the first water by some\r\nimpervious stratum of clay, hardpan or rock, and very commonly under\r\nsufficient pressure to rise somewhat higher than the point at which it\r\nwas struck, owing to connection with higher-lying sources of supply.\r\nWhen such pressure is sufficient to cause an overflow at the surface of\r\nthe ground, we have “Artesian” water as commonly understood.\r\n\r\n    _Lysimeters._—For the determination of the amount of\r\n    water percolating to given depths, water-tight receptacles\r\n    called lysimeters are usually employed. The best way to\r\n    establish such receptacles is to isolate a unit-area\r\n    (usually a square meter) by digging all around it to the\r\n    depth desired, then surrounding it with a metal sheet\r\n    soldered tightly at the cut edges, and finally driving in a\r\n    sharp-edged, stiff metal sheet so as to form the bottom when\r\n    soldered to the upright walls; leaving on one side an outlet\r\n    for the percolating water, which is then received into a\r\n    measuring receptacle somewhat like a rain gauge.\r\n\r\nHall (The Soil, p. 75) states that at Rothamstead, where an average\r\nrainfall of 31.3 inches is distributed rather uniformly through the\r\nseason, and where the soil is a moderately clayey loam, a little less\r\nthan half percolates through 20 inches of soil, and about 45% through\r\n60 inches.\r\n\r\n_Surface of Ground Water; Variations._—The surface of the water table,\r\nhowever, is rarely level except in level and very uniform ground, or\r\nafter long periods of drought. The undulations of its surface conform,\r\nin general, to that of the ground surface, but are less abrupt; so that\r\nthe water lies nearer to the surface in low than in high ground, as is\r\nindicated in the diagram above.\r\n\r\nKing[88] has shown, moreover, that the level of the ground water shows\r\nsensible variations due to increased or diminished barometric pressure,\r\nas well as to variations of temperature in the soil, which cause the\r\nair in the pores to expand or contract to a degree sufficient to bring\r\nabout variations in the flow of springs and underdrains to the extent\r\nof 8 and 15% respectively, in conformity with the daily changes of\r\ntemperature and pressure.\r\n\r\n[88] Physics of Agriculture, p. 270.\r\n\r\n_The Depth of the Ground Water most Favorable to Crops_ cannot be\r\nstated in a general manner, as it depends materially upon the nature of\r\nthe crop, its root habit, and the nature of the soil. As has already\r\nbeen said, the amount of soil-moisture most favorable to plant growth\r\nis about half of the maximum it can hold; and this condition, as is\r\nshown in the table in chapter 11, p. 208, is reached about the middle\r\nof the maximum height to which the water can rise by capillarity from\r\nthe water level. Below this point the access of air to the roots\r\nbecomes too limited, and in case of continuous rains the root-ends\r\nwould soon begin to suffer from want of aeration. On “sub-irrigated”\r\nland, therefore, which is generally considered desirable, crops must\r\nbe carefully selected with respect to their root habits. Thus while\r\nalfalfa needs considerable moisture to do its best, its deep-rooting\r\nhabit renders it undesirable when the ground water is at less than five\r\nfeet depth; but red clover may be grown even with the water level at\r\nthree feet.\r\n\r\nIn clayey soils root-penetration is always less than in sandy lands;\r\nand although in the former the capillary ascent of water goes higher\r\nthan in the latter, yet its movement in clays is so much slower than in\r\nsandy materials that unless water is within comparatively easy reach,\r\nthe plants may suffer from drought. Experience has long ago fixed the\r\nproper depth at which to lay underdrains limiting the rise of bottom\r\nwater, at from three to four and a half or even five feet in clay\r\nsoils; greater depths are only exceptionally used, partly because the\r\nlaying of drains then becomes too expensive.\r\n\r\nA mass of four feet of clay-loam soil is commonly, then, considered\r\nas sufficient to supply the needs of a crop; it being understood that\r\nin the humid region at least, such soils are usually the richest in\r\nplant food, so that a deeper range of the root system is not called\r\nfor. It is quite otherwise in the sandy soils of the same region, which\r\nbeing usually poor in plant food, must afford a deeper penetration in\r\norder that an adequate amount of the same shall be within reach of the\r\nroots. Sandy lands, then, should be deep in order to repay cultivation;\r\nand fortunately this is usually the case. But when this is otherwise;\r\nwhen for instance a sandy soil four feet in depth is underlaid by\r\nimpervious clay, underdrains may be quite as necessary as in the clay\r\nlands; since the depth of actually available soil mass would otherwise\r\nbe reduced to two or two and a half feet only, by the water stagnating\r\non the clay surface and rising from 16 to 24 inches in the sand. Soils\r\nthus shallowed can with difficulty be maintained in good productive\r\ncondition even by the most energetic fertilization.\r\n\r\n_Moisture supplied by tap roots._—In most cases, sandy lands do not\r\nrequire underdraining; and in them, root-penetration may reach to\r\nextraordinary depths in the case of certain plants, especially when\r\ntaprooted. Thus the roots of alfalfa (lucern) are very commonly found\r\nto reach depths of twenty to twenty-five feet, and even sixty feet has\r\nbeen credibly reported for the same plant in the arid region. It is\r\nobvious that for such plants, a high level of bottom water is wholly\r\nundesirable, since they are enabled to obtain their moisture supply\r\nfrom great depths, and can thus utilize for their nutrition much larger\r\nsoil-masses than can shallow-rooted plants.\r\n\r\n_Reserve of Capillary Water._—It must be remembered that it is not\r\nonly, nor usually, the bottom water that supplies moisture to plant\r\ngrowth; for all soils of proper texture for cultivation retain within\r\nthem a certain amount of capillary moisture after the ground water has\r\nreached its permanent level (see this chap. p. 226), and when the tap\r\nor main roots are plentifully supplied with water, the upper and chief\r\nfeeding roots draw but lightly upon the moisture within their immediate\r\nreach for the purpose of leaf evaporation. This fact can be plainly\r\nobserved in the arid region, when on the advent of the summer drought,\r\nyoung plantlets whose tap roots have reached a certain depth continue\r\nto flourish and develop, while others practically of the same age, but\r\nslightly behind, quickly succumb, though the _feeding_ roots of both\r\nmay draw upon the same soil layer. It is especially in sandy soils that\r\nmoisture is naturally thus conserved in the upper layers, because of\r\nthe failure of the water to rise by capillary ascent so as to evaporate\r\nfrom the surface layer. It is often surprising to find a good amount\r\nof moisture in the sandy soils of desert regions at the depth of eight\r\nor ten inches, when the surface is so hot as to scorch the fingers;\r\nand this moisture continues very uniformly to great depths, probably\r\nto bottom water lying twenty or more feet below the surface, which in\r\nsuch materials may readily be reached by taprooted plants such as the\r\n“sagebrush” (Artemisia tridentata), the saltbushes (Atriplex) and\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n_Injurious Rise of Bottom Water resulting from Irrigation._—In the\r\ndeep, pervious sandy lands of the arid region, especially where the\r\nrainfall is very low and can wet the soil annually only to two or three\r\nfeet depth, the substrata are sometimes found to be barely moist to\r\ndepths of thirty and forty feet, and the short-lived spring vegetation\r\ncarries off during its growth all the moisture supplied by the winter\r\nrains. When such lands are subjected to irrigation and the ditches\r\ncarrying the water are simply dug into the natural sandy land, the\r\nthirsty soil absorbs the water greedily, so that even a considerable\r\nvolume of water makes but slow progress toward the farther end of\r\nthe canals. Gradually, as the rapidity of absorption decreases, the\r\ndiminution of flow becomes less sensible, but still the loss thus\r\nexperienced may be a very considerable percentage of the whole supply.\r\nThus in the Great Valley of California, as well as in portions of\r\nWyoming (Bull. 61, p. 32), the permanent loss from seepage is in the\r\ncase of some extensive irrigation systems estimated at fully 50 per\r\ncent. When such lands have a considerable slope, the injury commonly\r\nends with the loss of the water, which in many cases is again gathered\r\nand utilized at a lower level. But when the lands have but a slight\r\nslope, the drainage may become so slow as to permit of the gradual\r\nrise of the seepage water in the substrata, until finally it may come\r\nto within a few feet of, or actually to the surface.\r\n\r\n_Consequences of the Swamping of Irrigated Lands._—The injurious\r\nconsequences of this swamping of the irrigated lands may readily\r\nbe imagined. The first effect is usually noted in the sickening or\r\ndying-out of orchards and vineyards, consequent upon the submergence\r\nof the deeper roots, which in such lands frequently reach to from\r\nfifteen to twenty feet below the surface. But even where pre-existing\r\nplantations are not in question, the shallowing of the soil- and\r\nsubsoil-strata from which the plants may draw their nourishment,\r\nconstitutes a most serious injury to the cultural value of the land. It\r\nhas become unsuited to deep-rooted crops; and where the natural soil,\r\nalone, would have perpetuated fertility for many years, fertilization\r\nbecomes necessary within a short time. The injury becomes doubly great\r\nwhen, as is frequently the case, the rising bottom water brings up\r\nwith it to the surface soil the alkali salts which previously were\r\ndistributed throughout many feet of substrata, frequently rendering\r\nprofitable cultivation impossible where formerly the most luxuriant\r\ncrops were grown.\r\n\r\nTheoretically of course it is perfectly easy to avoid or remedy these\r\ntroubles. It is only necessary to render the ditches water-tight by\r\npuddling with clay, cement, or otherwise. But the heavy cost of this\r\nimprovement forms a serious obstacle to its adoption by the ditch\r\ncompanies who are not themselves owners of land. Thus, extensive areas\r\nof lands which when first irrigated were among the most productive,\r\nhave in the course of eight or ten years become almost valueless to\r\ntheir owners, to whom legislation thus far affords but distant promise\r\nof relief; although the case seems in equity to fall clearly within the\r\nlimits of the laws governing trespass.\r\n\r\n_Permanent Injury to Certain Lands._—In cases like those alluded to the\r\nremedy usually available for higher ground-water does not always afford\r\nrelief, even when otherwise available. Long-continued submergence\r\nproduces in many soils effects which cannot easily, if at all, be\r\novercome by subsequent aeration. This is most emphatically true of\r\nsoils containing a large proportion of ferric hydrate in the finely\r\ndivided form in which it is usually present in “red” soils.\r\n\r\nThe first effect of the stagnation of water in such lands (as\r\nalready explained in a former chapter 3, p. 45) is to set up a\r\nreductive (bacterial) fermentation of the organic matter of the soil,\r\ntransforming the ferric into ferrous hydrate, which in the presence of\r\nthe carbonic acid simultaneously formed, becomes ferrous carbonate,\r\nreadily soluble in carbonated water. That this compound is poisonous\r\nto plant growth, has been stated (chap. 3, p. 46). The carbonates of\r\nlime and magnesia are simultaneously dissolved by the same, as is\r\nalso calcic phosphate, the usual form in which phosphoric acid is\r\npresent in the soil. Under the influence of partial aeration from\r\nthe surface, the ferrous carbonate is slowly re-transformed into\r\nferric hydrate, aggregated in the form of spots or concretions of\r\n“bog ore” (see chapter 5, p. 66). In this process the greater part of\r\nthe phosphoric acid of the soil is also abstracted from its general\r\nmass and concentrated in the bog ore (chap. 5, p. 65), in which it is\r\nwholly unavailable to vegetation, and cannot be made available while\r\nin the ground, by any known process. The soil is therefore permanently\r\nimpoverished in phosphoric acid; it is also deprived of its content of\r\nferric hydrate, and is transferred from the class of “red” to that of\r\n“white” soils, well known everywhere to be unthrifty and to require\r\nearly fertilization. Not only is this true, because of their almost\r\ninvariable poverty in phosphoric acid, but also usually in lime, which\r\nlike the iron, if not leached out, is aggregated into concretions\r\nin the subsoil, leaving the surface soil depleted of this important\r\ningredient. The humus, also, is either destroyed or at least “soured”\r\nat the same time.\r\n\r\n    _Reduction of Sulfates._—Should such a soil contain\r\n    any considerable amount of sulfates, especially in the form\r\n    of gypsum or calcic (or magnesic) sulfate, the reductive\r\n    process results in the formation of iron pyrite (ferric\r\n    sulfid, chap. 5, p. 75); while at the same time the soil is\r\n    often sufficiently impregnated with sulfuretted hydrogen as\r\n    to be readily perceived by the odor, or by the blackening of\r\n    a silver coin. This is very commonly the case in sea-coast\r\n    marshes, where a hole made with a stick thrust into the mud\r\n    will be found to give forth both carburetted and sulfuretted\r\n    hydrogen, while a careful washing of the soil will reveal\r\n    the presence of minute crystals of iron pyrite. Hence the\r\n    need of prolonged aeration of marsh soils, effecting the\r\n    peroxidation of the ferrous compounds, and the conversion of\r\n    the pyrite first into ferrous sulfate, and subsequently into\r\n    innocuous, yellow, insoluble ferric oxy-sulfate.\r\n\r\n_Ferruginous Lands._—The injurious effect of the swamping of\r\nferruginous lands has been especially conspicuous in some of the\r\nirrigated rolling lands of the Sierra Foothills of California, where\r\norchards planted in relatively low ground and in full bearing have\r\nsuccumbed to the poisonous effects of the ferrous carbonate formed\r\nin the subsoil, long before the water had risen so high that, had\r\nthe trees been grown afterwards, they would have adapted their\r\nroot system to the existing conditions and fared moderately well\r\nat least. Underdrainage of the lower lands is, of course, the only\r\npossible remedy for this state of things, although even then the\r\nroot-penetration is much more restricted, and therefore natural\r\nfertility of much shorter duration, than would have been the case\r\nwithout the rise of the irrigation water.\r\n\r\nIt is thus clear that in the practice of irrigation, the liability\r\nof injury to the lower ground by “swamping” through the rise of the\r\nground water should always be kept in view; that, in fact, irrigation\r\nand provision for drainage should always go hand in hand. The legal\r\nprovisions facilitating the rights-of-way for irrigation ditches should\r\nbe made equally cogent with respect to drainage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nWATER OF SOILS (_Continued_).\r\n\r\nTHE REGULATION AND CONSERVATION OF SOIL MOISTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn view of the commanding importance of an adequate supply of water to\r\nvegetation, the possible and available means of assuring such supply\r\nby utilizing to the best advantage both rainfall and irrigation water,\r\nrequire the closest consideration.\r\n\r\n_Loosening of the Surface._—The first thing needful, of course, is\r\nto allow the water free opportunity to soak into the soil, so as to\r\nmoisten the land as deeply as possible. That to this end the surface\r\nshould be kept loose and pervious by tillage, breaking up crusts\r\nthat may have been formed by the beating of rains, has already been\r\ndiscussed. In the case of heavy clay soils, however, this alone is not\r\nalways sufficient. The most effectual way to loosen the land to greater\r\ndepths than can be reached by tillage, is by means of underdrains laid\r\nat the greatest depth that is practically admissible.\r\n\r\n_Effects of Underdrains._—That drain tiles laid for the express purpose\r\nof carrying off surplus water should help to conserve soil moisture,\r\nseems at first sight to be a paradox. Yet the explanation of the fact,\r\nwhich has been demonstrated by long experience, is not difficult. The\r\neffect is most striking in clay soils, for sandy soils are commonly\r\nnaturally underdrained already.\r\n\r\nIn discussing the changes of volume which soils undergo in wetting\r\nand drying, the fundamental points in the premises have already\r\nbeen mentioned (see chap. 7, p. 112). Clay soils in drying shrink\r\nconsiderably, and re-expand on wetting, but rather slowly; moreover,\r\nsome clays crumble when wetted _after_ drying, while others, very\r\nplastic when wet, crumble on drying (see chap. 7, p. 116).\r\n\r\nIt follows that while a clay subsoil when kept permanently wet, will\r\nform a uniform, pasty, difficultly penetrable mass: when subjected\r\nto frequent alternate wetting and drying, it becomes fissured and\r\ncrumbly, so as to resemble in its texture a tilled soil. This frequent\r\nalternation of wetting and drying is precisely what, in the course of\r\ntime, is brought about by underdrains; rendering clay subsoils pervious\r\nboth to air and water. The consequence is that even heavy rains can be\r\nfully absorbed by the soil mass lying above the drains, the surplus\r\ndraining off readily in a short time. Roots therefore can not only\r\npenetrate, but exercise their vegetative functions perfectly at the\r\nfull depth of the drains. They are still at liberty to penetrate as\r\nmuch deeper as their demands for moisture may require; but the depth\r\nof four to four and a half feet is already so much greater than in the\r\nhumid region would usually be reached by them in undrained clay soils,\r\nthat commonly the moisture successively retained within that mass is\r\nas much as is required by them during the growing season. At the same\r\ntime, their feeding roots are so far below the surface, that ordinary\r\nshort droughts do not reach them at all; while the underdrains prevent\r\nany injurious stagnation of water around them. It need hardly be added\r\nthat the entire task of cultivation is also greatly facilitated; not\r\nonly because drained soils can be plowed within a few hours after the\r\ncessation of rains, as against the same number of days that would have\r\nto elapse in the undrained areas; but because tillage is easier, and\r\nless draft is required, even when it is carried to a much greater depth.\r\n\r\n_Underdrainage_, then, must be counted as being among the most\r\neffective means both of utilizing the rainfall so as to prevent loss\r\nfrom runoff and injury from washing, and of creating a deep, loose,\r\npervious soil mass, well adapted to root penetration as well as to\r\nthe conservation of moisture; rendering possible timely tillage and\r\ncultivation, and early development of crops fully supplied with\r\nmoisture and therefore secure against loss from drought. The safety\r\nand improvement of crops thus secured corresponds in the humid region\r\nto that brought about by the command of irrigation water in the arid\r\ncountries. But it by no means follows that underdrainage can therefore\r\nbe dispensed with in the latter, or irrigation in the former. Both\r\nhave their proper place in both regions; but from special causes\r\nunderdrainage, as has already been stated, should be widely used in\r\nirrigation countries to prevent the injuries otherwise but too likely\r\nto arise from over-irrigation (see chap. 12, p. 231).\r\n\r\n_Winter Irrigation._—In many regions where irrigation is desirable but\r\nnot absolutely necessary in ordinary seasons, or where irrigation water\r\nis scarce in summer, much advantage is gained by insuring thorough\r\nsaturation of the land during the latter part of winter, especially\r\nwhen spring or summer crops are to be sown. The not inconsiderable time\r\nrequired for water to reach its permanent level or the country drainage\r\nin most soils, often insures the retention of a certain surplus over\r\nwhat the soil can permanently hold, within the period when it can be\r\nutilized by growing crops; whose roots moreover are more likely to\r\npenetrate deeply in land where there is a steady increase of moisture\r\nas they descend, than when the contrary condition is encountered. The\r\nuse of _winter flood-waters to saturate the land_ is therefore in many\r\ncases the saving clause for a dry season.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHODS OF IRRIGATION.[89]\r\n\r\nThe manner in which irrigation water is supplied to land and especially\r\nto growing crops exerts such a potent influence not only upon the\r\nwelfare of the plants but also upon the condition of the land, that a\r\nbrief discussion of this topic seems necessary.\r\n\r\nThe following methods are in use to a greater or less extent:\r\n\r\n    1. Surface sprinkling.\r\n    2. Flooding.\r\n           A. By lateral overflow from furrows or ditches.\r\n           B. By the “check” system.\r\n    3. Furrow irrigation.\r\n    4. Lateral seepage from ditches.\r\n    5. Basin irrigation.\r\n    6. Irrigation from underground pipes.\r\n\r\n[89] Only a general outline of the principles of this subject is\r\ngiven in this volume; special works must be consulted for working\r\ndetails. Among these the volume by King on “Irrigation and Drainage”\r\ngives probably the most comprehensive presentation of the subject for\r\nboth humid and arid climates. Also bulletins of the U. S. Dep’t of\r\nAgriculture.\r\n\r\n_Surface Sprinkling._—This method seems to be the closest imitation of\r\nthe natural rainfall; and yet it is in practice about the most wasteful\r\nand least satisfactory of all. It is difficult of application on any\r\nlarge scale, from obvious causes; on the small scale, in gardens and on\r\nlawns, its disadvantages become amply apparent. As usually practiced,\r\nfrom a rose spout or spray nozzle, the water falls much more abundantly\r\nthan in the case of any desirable rain, within the short time allowed\r\nby the patience of the operator. If continued for a sufficient length\r\nof time to soak the soil to the desirable depth, it compacts the\r\nsurface of the ground so as to render subsequent tillage indispensable.\r\nTo avoid this, amateur gardeners usually restrict the time of\r\napplication, repeating the same at frequent intervals, sometimes daily.\r\nThe result is that the very slight penetration of the water either\r\nfails to reach the absorbent roots, so that it is of little use to\r\nthem, and is evaporated by the next day’s sun or wind; or else it tends\r\nto draw the roots close to the surface, where, unless the application\r\nof water is actually made daily, they are sure to suffer from the first\r\nintermission of the daily dose. In actual practice the sprinkling\r\nmethod is therefore both inefficient and wasteful of water, and exposes\r\nthe plants to grave injury from any cessation of the water supply.\r\n\r\nFlooding presupposes land either level or only slightly sloping\r\nnaturally, or rendered so artificially; usually by means of the plow\r\nand horse scraper.\r\n\r\n_Flooding_ by lateral overflow from large furrows, or ditches, is very\r\ncommonly practiced where the water supply is abundant and large areas,\r\nsuch as alfalfa or grain fields, are to be irrigated. The overflow is\r\nregulated by portable check-boards, proceeding from the highest points\r\nto the lowest, and leaving each temporary dike in place until the\r\nground is adequately soaked or the water reaches the next furrow below.\r\nIn heavy ground the operation may have to be repeated to insure proper\r\ndepth of percolation.\r\n\r\n_Check flooding_ necessitates more careful leveling, and the throwing\r\nup of small dikes, either temporary or permanent. The costliness\r\nof the earth-work restricts the use of this method materially, and\r\nthe inconvenience caused in tillage by the dikes is objectionable,\r\nespecially in large-scale culture. For the case of alfalfa fields,\r\nwhich remain permanently set for a number of years, it is however\r\nthe largely preferred method. In the case of field cultures, the\r\nconsolidation of the surface that follows flooding on the heavier soils\r\nrenders subsequent tillage necessary in all but very sandy soils; and\r\nhence it should always _precede_ broadcast sowing.\r\n\r\nOne disadvantage of the surface flooding system is the slow penetration\r\nof the water caused by the resistance of the air in the soil to\r\ndownward displacement; its buoyancy acting directly contrary to the\r\npercolation of the water. In close-grained, heavy soils this objection\r\nis very serious, on account of the loss of time involved when the\r\nirrigator’s time is limited. On sandy lands the air bubbles up quite\r\nlivelily at first, but this soon ceases and the air is compelled to\r\nescape sideways as best it can.\r\n\r\n_Furrow Irrigation._—By this method it is intended to soak the land\r\nuniformly by allowing the water to flow through furrows drawn 3 to 8\r\nfeet apart, with a gentle slope from the supply or head ditch; the\r\nflow being continued until the water has reached the far end of the\r\nfurrows, or longer according to the nature of the soil, especially\r\nif another ditch to receive the surplus flow lies below. The furrows\r\nshould subsequently be closed by means of the plow or cultivator; but\r\neven if left open they are much less a source of waste by evaporation\r\nthan would be a flooded surface. The water thus, in the main, soaks\r\ndownward and only reaches the surface by capillary rise, so that the\r\nland between the furrows is not sensibly compacted when the furrows\r\nhave been made deep enough. Evidently this is a much more rational\r\nprocedure than surface flooding, as it tends to leave most of the\r\nsurface in loose tilth, while penetrating to much greater advantage,\r\nbecause of the ready escape of the air from the soil. It is the system\r\nnaturally and almost exclusively used in truck gardens and orchards,\r\nand generally where crops are grown in drills or rows sufficiently far\r\napart to permit of cultivation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Furrows 6 inches deep in Heavy Loam Soil_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Narrow and Wide Furrows in Sandy Loam Soil_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Furrows 5 and 10 inches deep in Sandy Loam Soil_\r\n\r\n_Water running, in each, seven hours_\r\n\r\nFIG. 43.—Profiles of Water penetration in Furrow Irrigation.]\r\n\r\nThe figure annexed[90] shows the manner in which water sinks and\r\nspreads from furrows of various depths and widths, as actually\r\nobserved in the work of the Irrigation Division of the U. S. Dep’t of\r\nAgriculture, under the direct supervision of Prof. R. H. Loughridge of\r\nthe California Station. The mode of percolation is shown for two soils,\r\na heavy loam and a sandy one, both in the vicinity of Riverside, Cal.\r\n\r\n[90] Published by permission of the Department.\r\n\r\nThe upper section shows the variation in penetration in one and the\r\nsame soil with the same kind of furrow, the broken line indicating the\r\ncessation of the flow in the furrows; after which there was a still\r\nfarther penetration of the water to from 6 to 9 inches deeper.\r\n\r\nThe second section from above shows the percolation of the water\r\nrespectively in wide and narrow furrows of the same depth. It is\r\nevident at a glance how much more effective is the wide furrow in\r\nutilizing the limited time during which the irrigator usually has the\r\nflow at his command.\r\n\r\nThe third section shows several practically important points in favor\r\nof the wide and deep instead of narrow and shallow furrow. It is seen\r\nthat in doubling the width and depth, the penetration has also nearly\r\ndoubled. Moreover, it is seen that in the deep furrow the water has not\r\nin the course of seven hours reached the surface at all, being still\r\nsix inches away; so that in view of the diminishing ratio of capillary\r\nascent, it probably would not have reached the edge of the furrow, at\r\nthe surface, in less than thirty hours. Thus all surface evaporation,\r\nwhich oftentimes causes the loss of 50 % of the water entering the\r\nshallow furrows, would be prevented; and a dry furrow-slice might\r\nbe turned into the furrow immediately after the cessation of the\r\nwater-flow, effectually obviating the need of subsequent tillage\r\nalso. The cost of the latter, together with the saving in water, and\r\nincreased efficiency of the water by deeper penetration, will much more\r\nthan offset the additional cost and trouble of plowing deeper furrows.\r\n\r\nThere is therefore every reason for doing away with the wasteful,\r\neasy-going practice of irrigating in numerous shallow furrows, by which\r\nthe irrigator loses up to half of the water paid for, by evaporation;\r\nis compelled to wait for the soaked surface to dry before being able\r\nto turn back a furrow-slice into the furrows to prevent the drying-out\r\nof their moisture; and by losing penetration of the water, is obliged\r\nto irrigate again within a much shorter time than will be necessary if\r\ndeep-furrow irrigation be used.\r\n\r\nA similar experiment with deep and shallow furrows was made at the\r\nSouthern California station near Pomona in 1901, as reported in\r\nBulletin 138 of the California Station. The results as far as they\r\nwent were precisely similar, and upon the basis of these the writer\r\nearnestly advocated deep-furrow irrigation, and had the satisfaction\r\nof seeing it strongly approved by orange-growers at Riverside and\r\nelsewhere, by putting it into practice.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the saving and better utilization of the water used,\r\nthis mode of application has the advantage of preventing the roots from\r\ncoming too near the surface; it will also largely eliminate “irrigation\r\nhardpan” or plowsole.\r\n\r\nThe results produced by long-continued shallow plowing and irrigation\r\nin shallow furrows is well illustrated in the last of the irrigation\r\nprofiles, which shows the observations made on the same land as the\r\nothers, but where rational cultivation and deep-furrow irrigation\r\nhad not yet been introduced. It will be seen that after applying,\r\nand of course paying for, the water for three days, its average\r\npenetration was only about eighteen inches; so that the trees of the\r\norchard received very little benefit, and were supposed to be needing\r\nfertilization when in fact they were simply suffering from lack of\r\nwater at the lower roots.\r\n\r\nOne somewhat unexpected point is shown by these diagrams, viz., the\r\nslight sidewise penetration of the water; the wetted areas having a\r\nnearly vertical lateral outline. This means, of course, that unless the\r\nfurrows run very near the trees of an orchard, the soil immediately\r\nbeneath the trees will remain dry; thus inducing the roots to spread\r\nsideways and losing depth of penetration and soil. It will be noted\r\nespecially in the lower figure that here again the deep furrow offers\r\na material advantage over the shallow, the sidewise spread being much\r\nmore pronounced than in the shallow furrow alongside.\r\n\r\n_Distance Between Furrows and Ditches._—The distance between the\r\nfurrows must, of course, be proportioned to the readiness with which\r\nthe water penetrates, being less as the land is of closer texture.\r\nThe distance between head ditches must, on the contrary, vary in\r\nthe opposite sense, since if these are too far apart, the water near\r\nthe head ditch will in sandy lands be wasting into the subdrainage\r\nbefore the end of the furrows is reached; so that the distribution\r\nwill be very uneven. The great differences observed between crops, and\r\nespecially trees, _below_ and _above_ the head ditches, are mainly due\r\nto this unevenness in water distribution, caused by too great distance\r\nbetween successive head ditches. Each farmer must himself, however,\r\ndetermine by actual trial the proper distances between ditches as well\r\nas furrows, for his particular case; since everything depends upon the\r\nrapidity with which water will penetrate the soil and subsoil. Actual\r\ntests to determine this point[91] should be the first step, before\r\nlaying off the system of ditches as well as furrows. It not uncommonly\r\nhappens that the failure to do this at first, compels a subsequent\r\ntotal change of arrangements in this respect. (See page 253 below).\r\n\r\n[91] Such tests can be readily made by any one, by digging a pit to\r\nfour or five feet depth, and supplying water to a shallow basin dug\r\ninto the surface 8 to 12 inches distant from the vertical wall of the\r\npit. The descent of the water is then readily observed on the vertical\r\nside of the pit nearest to the water basin. Preliminary tests with soil\r\nprobe (see chap. 10, p. 177).\r\n\r\n    Thus while in some very pervious land furrows may be six\r\n    or even eight feet apart, in other cases, in certain\r\n    finely pulverulent or silty soils such as the “dust soils”\r\n    described in a former chapter; (see chapter 6, p. 104),\r\n    furrows drawn three feet apart may fail to allow the water\r\n    to penetrate so as to prevent grain on the middle foot\r\n    from suffering from drought after the water has run for\r\n    twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\n_Irrigation by lateral Seepage._—Is in reality a mere modification\r\nof furrow irrigation, practiced in the case of lands very readily\r\npermeable, and where water is abundant. The fields are laid off in\r\n“lands” twelve to twenty-five feet wide, with a deep furrow or narrow\r\nditch between, from which water percolates in a short time so as to\r\noverlap from the two sides. In this case sometimes the water does not\r\nreach the surface visibly at all; a very great advantage where alkali\r\nexists, as surface evaporation, and the consequent accumulation of\r\nalkali, is thus effectually prevented; while deep-rooting is favored to\r\nthe utmost.\r\n\r\n_Basin Irrigation._—In this method of irrigation, practiced only in\r\nthe case of trees and sometimes vines, and when water is scarce, a\r\nwide circular furrow or basin is excavated around each trunk and water\r\nis run either from one to the other, or sideways from a furrow laid\r\nalong the rows. The water thus applied of course percolates immediately\r\naround the trunk first, and in practice is found to follow also the\r\nlarge roots; so that it goes precisely where it is most wanted, besides\r\nforming a vertical body of moist soil reaching to considerable depth,\r\nwhere it is most desirable that the root system should follow. By\r\nthis deep penetration to natural moisture in the depths of the soil,\r\ncomparatively small quantities of water produce very marked effects.\r\n\r\nOn the same principle, the grape vines which bear some of the choicest\r\nraisins of Malaga on the arid coastward slopes, are made to supply\r\nthemselves with moisture, without irrigation, by opening around them\r\nlarge, funnel-shaped pits, which remain open in winter so as to catch\r\nthe rain, causing it to penetrate downward along the taproot of the\r\nvine, in clay shale quite similar to that of the California Coast\r\nRanges, and like the latter almost vertically on edge. Yet on these\r\nsame slopes scarcely any natural vegetation now finds a foothold.\r\n\r\nSimilarly the “ryats” of parts of India water their crops by applying\r\nto each plant immediately around the stem such scanty measure of the\r\nprecious fluid as they have taken from wells, often of considerable\r\ndepth, which form their only source of water-supply. Perhaps in\r\nimitation of these, an industrious farmer has practiced a similar\r\nsystem on the high benches of Kern River, California, and has\r\nsuccessfully grown excellent fruit for years, on land that would\r\noriginally grow nothing but cactus. Sub-irrigation from pipes has been\r\napplied in a similar manner.\r\n\r\nA combination of the furrow- and basin-irrigation system is sometimes\r\npracticed in southern California by drawing the furrow so as to bring\r\nthe tree within a square, one side of which is left closed. The same\r\nresult may be accomplished by plowing cross furrows at right angles\r\nnear the tree and then placing check-boards so as to force the water\r\nalong the rows, zigzagging, on three sides.\r\n\r\nThe basin irrigation of orchards was originally largely practiced in\r\nCalifornia, but has now been mostly abandoned for furrow irrigation.\r\nThe latter has been adopted partly because it requires a great deal\r\nless hand-labor, partly under the impression that the whole of the soil\r\nof the orchard is thus most thoroughly utilized; partly also because of\r\nthe injurious effect upon trees produced at times by basin irrigation.\r\n\r\nThe explanation of such injurious effects is, essentially, that _cold_\r\nirrigation water depresses too much the temperature of the earth\r\nimmediately around the roots, and thus hinders active vegetation to\r\nan injurious extent, sometimes so as to bring about the dropping of\r\nthe fruit. This of course is a very serious objection, to obviate\r\nwhich it might be necessary to reservoir the water so as to allow it\r\nto warm before being applied to the trees.[92] In furrow-irrigation\r\nthe amount of soil soaked with the water is so great that the latter\r\nis soon effectually warmed up, besides not coming in contact too\r\nintimately with the main roots of the tree; along which the water\r\nsoaks very readily when applied to the trunk, thus affecting their\r\ntemperature much more directly. It is for the farmer to determine which\r\nconsideration should prevail in a given case. If the water-supply be\r\nscant and warm, the most effectual use that can be made of it is to\r\napply it immediately around the tree, in a circular trench dug for the\r\npurpose. When on the contrary, irrigation water is abundant and its\r\ntemperature low, it may be preferable to practice furrow irrigation, or\r\npossibly even flooding.\r\n\r\n[92] See below, chap. 17.\r\n\r\nAs to the supposed more complete use of the soil under the latter\r\ntwo methods, it must be remembered that while this is the case in\r\na _horizontal_ direction, if irrigation is practiced too copiously\r\nunder the shallow-furrow system, it may easily happen that the gain\r\nmade horizontally is more than offset by a corresponding loss in the\r\n_vertical_ penetration of the root-system. This is amply apparent in\r\nsome of the irrigated orange groves of southern California, where the\r\nfine roots of the trees fill the surface soil as do the roots of maize\r\nin a corn field of the Mississippi States; so that the plow can hardly\r\nbe run without turning them up and under. In these same orchards it\r\nwill often be observed, in digging down, that at a depth of a few feet\r\nthe soil is too water-soaked to permit of the proper exercise of the\r\nroot-functions, and that the roots existing there are either inactive\r\nor diseased. That in such cases frequent irrigation and abundant\r\nfertilization alone can maintain an orchard in bearing condition, is\r\na matter of course; and there can be no question that a great deal of\r\nthe constant cry for the fertilization of orchards in the irrigated\r\nsections is due quite as much to the shallowness of rooting induced by\r\nover-irrigation, as to any really necessary exhaustion of the land.\r\nWhen the roots are induced to come to and remain at the surface,\r\nwithin a surface layer of eighteen to twenty inches, it naturally\r\nbecomes necessary to feed these roots abundantly, both with moisture\r\nand with plant-food. This has, as naturally, led to an overestimate of\r\nthe requirements of the trees in both respects. Had deep-rooting been\r\nencouraged at first in the deep soils of the southern “citrus belt,”\r\ninstead of over-stimulating the growth by surface fertilization and\r\nfrequent irrigation, some delay in bearing would have been compensated\r\nfor by less of current outlay for fertilizers, and less liability\r\nto injury from frequently unavoidable delay, or from inadequacy, of\r\nirrigation.\r\n\r\n_Irrigation by Underground Pipes._—Where economy in the use of\r\nirrigation water is a pressing requirement, its distribution through\r\nunderground pipes affords the surest mode of accomplishing that end,\r\nin connection with the application of the water in accordance with the\r\nprinciples just discussed. The enormous saving of water effected by\r\nits conveyance in cement-lined ditches or concrete pipes, as compared\r\nwith earth ditches, if additionally combined with its application to\r\nindividual trees or vines, presents the maximum of economy that can\r\nbe effected. The actual use of this method is unfortunately limited\r\nin practice by the high first cost of piping; but as its use renders\r\nunnecessary the digging of basins and plowing of furrows and their\r\nsubsequent closing-up, it is when once established by far the cheapest\r\nsystem, both as to the use of water and of labor.\r\n\r\n    The best results of this system are undoubtedly achieved\r\n    by the use of iron pipes for the distribution in field and\r\n    orchard, whatever may be the material used for the main\r\n    conduits. The use of concrete and tile in small sizes proves\r\n    in the end very expensive, because of frequent breakage,\r\n    and leakage due to varying pressure in the supply pipes or\r\n    reservoirs; as well as from even slight earthquake tremors,\r\n    undermining by water or by the burrowing of animals, and\r\n    many other accidents which do not affect an iron pipe\r\n    system. The pipes must in any case, of course, be laid\r\n    deep enough to be out of reach of the deepest tillage;\r\n    therefore not less than one foot, and preferably eighteen\r\n    inches. A proper construction of the outlets, permitting of\r\n    exact regulation of the flow and ready operation from above\r\n    ground, as well as preventing their being clogged by earth,\r\n    rust, roots or burrowing animals, insects etc., is of course\r\n    of the greatest importance. A variety of devices for this\r\n    purpose is already on the market.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUALITY OF THE IRRIGATION WATER.\r\n\r\n_Saline Waters._—Considering the large amount of water annually used\r\nin irrigation, among the most needful precautions to be observed by\r\nthe irrigator is in the testing of the quality of his water-supply.\r\nFirst among the points to be noted is the possible content of\r\nsoluble “alkali” salts. While in most cases what is called the “rise\r\nof the alkali” is due to the salts already contained in the soil\r\nand subsoil, in but too many the evil is either brought about, or\r\ngreatly aggravated, by the excessive saline contents of the water\r\nused in irrigation. The effects of the use of saline irrigation water\r\n(containing in this case about 100 grains per gallon, or 1700 parts\r\nper million) are shown in the accompanying plate. The predominant\r\ningredients of these alkali salts were common salt and carbonate of\r\nsoda. In the lands near Corona, Cal., where this case was observed, the\r\noriginal alkali-content of the soil was about 2500 pounds per acre in\r\nfour feet depth, and had been just quadrupled, with the results shown;\r\nviz., complete defoliation of the orange trees, while on the same\r\nland, where the trees had been irrigated with good artesian water, the\r\norchard was in fine condition.\r\n\r\n_Limits of Salinity._—It is not easy to assign a definite limit of\r\nmineral content beyond which water should be considered unfit for\r\nirrigation purposes; partly because of the differences in the kind of\r\nthe mineral salts, partly because the nature of the soil and the amount\r\nof water at command, materially influence its availability.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 44.—Orange Trees Irrigated with Artesian Water.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 45.—Lake Elsinore Water, Three Years.]\r\n\r\nForty grains per gallon is usually assigned as the limit for potable\r\nas well as irrigation waters. But if most or the whole of such mineral\r\ncontents should consist of the carbonates and sulfates of lime and\r\nmagnesia, the water while unsuitable for domestic use may be perfectly\r\navailable for irrigation, since these salts are either beneficial or\r\nharmless in the amounts likely to be introduced by the water. But\r\nif most or the whole of such forty grains should consist of “alkali\r\nsalts” proper, viz., the sulfates, chlorids and carbonates of potash\r\nand soda, or if they should contain even small amounts of the chlorid\r\nof magnesium, they might render the water either wholly unsuitable for\r\nirrigation, or if used it would be needful to take the mineral content\r\ninto consideration, by regulating its application accordingly.\r\n\r\nIt has been found in California that practically the upper limit of\r\nmineral content for irrigation water _under the ordinary practice_ lies\r\nbelow seventy grains per gallon in _all_ cases; for when this strength\r\nis reached, even though such water may bathe the roots of almost any\r\nplant with impunity, yet accidental concentration by evaporation is\r\nso certain to happen, that injury to crops is practically almost\r\nunavoidable.\r\n\r\n    In South Dakota and other parts of the American semi-arid\r\n    region, waters containing seventy grains and even more of\r\n    alkali salts per gallon are annually used during the short\r\n    irrigation season. This can be done harmlessly because the\r\n    aggregate amount used is only small, and the more abundant\r\n    rainfall of that region annually washes the salts out of the\r\n    soil. But where almost the full amount of water required\r\n    by crops must be supplied by irrigation, the total amount\r\n    of salts thus introduced would speedily render the land\r\n    uncultivable.\r\n\r\nAccording to the observations of Means and other explorers[93] of the\r\nU. S. Dep’t of Agriculture, waters of much higher mineral content are\r\nused for irrigation both in Egypt and in the Saharan region, some\r\ngoing as high as 8000 parts per million, or 214 grains per gallon. The\r\ncultivators are said to be very skilful in the use of these waters,\r\napplying them only to plants of known resistance, and in certain ways.\r\nThese ways include doubtless a good deal more time and patience than\r\nAmerican irrigators are ordinarily willing to bestow upon their work.\r\nMuch depends of course not only upon the character of the salts in the\r\nwater, but also upon the long experience had in the old irrigation\r\nregions.\r\n\r\n[93] Bull. No. 21, Bureau of Soils; also circular No. 10, ibid.\r\n\r\n_Mode of using Saline Irrigation Waters._—The fact that abundant\r\ngrowths of native as well as cultivated plants may sometimes be seen\r\non the margins of “alkali lakes” where water of over a hundred grains\r\nof mineral salts per gallon continuously bathes the roots, while the\r\nsame plants perish at some distance from the water’s edge, points the\r\nway to the utilization, in emergencies, of fairly strong saline waters;\r\nviz., by the prevention of their concentration to the point of injury\r\n_by evaporation_. It is clear that when such waters are used sparingly,\r\nso as to penetrate but a few feet underground, whence the moisture\r\nre-ascends for evaporation at the surface, a few repetitions of its\r\nuse will accumulate so much alkali near the surface as to bring about\r\nserious injury. If, on the other hand, the water is used so abundantly\r\nthat the roots may be considered as being, like the marginal vegetation\r\nof alkali lakes, bathed only by water of moderate strength, no such\r\ninjury need occur; and what does accumulate in consequence of the\r\ninevitable measure of evaporation occurring in the course of a season,\r\nmay be washed out of the land by _copious winter irrigation_.\r\n\r\nThis, of course, presupposes that the land, as is mostly the case\r\nin the arid region, is readily drained downwards when a sufficiency\r\nof water is used. When this is not the case, _e. g._, in clay or\r\nadobe soils, or in those underlaid by hardpan, waters which in sandy\r\nlands could have been used with impunity, may become inapplicable to\r\nirrigation use.\r\n\r\n_Apparent Paradox._—The prescription to use saline waters _more\r\nabundantly_ than purer ones, in order to avoid injury from alkali,\r\nthough paradoxical at first sight, is therefore plainly justified by\r\ncommon sense as well as by experience, in pervious (sandy) soils;\r\nwhile in difficultly permeable ones, their use may be either wholly\r\nimpracticable, or subject to very close limitation.\r\n\r\nSometimes the alternate use of pure and salt-charged water serves to\r\neke out a too scant supply of the former. But in all such cases, close\r\nattention to the _measure_ of water that will wet the soil to a certain\r\ndepth, and “eternal vigilance” with respect to the accumulation of\r\nalkali near the surface, must be the price of immunity from injury. In\r\nall cases the farmer should know how much of alkali salts he introduces\r\ninto his land with the irrigation water, and watch that it does not\r\napproach too closely, or exceed, the tolerance of his crops for alkali\r\nsalts, as given in chapter 26.\r\n\r\n_Use of Drainage Waters for Irrigation._—When lands charged with alkali\r\nsalts are being reclaimed by drainage, the question sometimes arises\r\nwhether the drainage-water may not be used for irrigation, lower down.\r\nThis of course depends entirely upon the amount of alkali in the water,\r\nthe nature of the lands to be irrigated, and the manner of applying it.\r\nIn the Fresno drainage-district of California it has been shown that\r\nsome of the drainage-water contains not more than 25 to 30 grains per\r\ngallon of objectionable salts, and such waters could of course be used\r\non pervious lands with the precautions above noted.\r\n\r\n_“Black Alkali” Waters._—As regards, however, waters containing any\r\nlarge proportion of carbonate of soda, it must be remembered that\r\neven very dilute solutions of salsoda serve to puddle the soil and\r\nthus render it difficultly tillable. When such waters are used it\r\nis necessary to forestall injury either by the use of gypsum in the\r\nreservoir or ditch, or by annually using on the land a sufficient\r\namount of gypsum to transform the carbonate of soda into the relatively\r\ninnocuous sulfate.\r\n\r\n_Variations in the Saline Contents of Irrigation Waters._—When\r\nirrigation waters are derived from deep wells, there is little if\r\nany variation of their saline contents to be expected, and a single\r\nanalysis will serve permanently. But in the case of relatively\r\nshallow wells, from which the water must be raised by pumping, it not\r\nunfrequently happens that after a series of seasons of short rainfall,\r\nsaline waters are brought up by the pump and may seriously injure\r\ncrops and orchards. Again, in the case of streams and rivers whose\r\nflow becomes very small in summer, the saline content may increase to\r\nseveral times the amount carried at the time of high water. Both kinds\r\nof cases occur in southern California, in Arizona,[94] New Mexico and\r\nother states of the arid region. The Gila, Pecos and upper Rio Grande\r\nare cases in point, and to a certain extent the Colorado of the West.\r\n\r\n[94] Bull. Ariz. Exp’t Sta. No. 44.\r\n\r\n_Muddy Waters._—In the latter as well as other streams of Arizona,\r\nthere is another point which sometimes creates difficulties to the\r\nirrigator, together with some current expense. It is the amount of silt\r\nor mud carried by the water, which while it is a benefit to the land\r\nover which it is spread, (“warping”) as in the classic case of the\r\nNile, often clogs the irrigation ditches to such an extent as to cause\r\nconsiderable inconvenience and expense in cleaning them out. This is\r\nespecially the case in the streams draining pasture lands that have\r\nbeen overstocked, and where the destruction of the natural herbage\r\nallows the rain water to run off rapidly, at first forming runlets and\r\nthen gullies and ravines that originally were simply cow-paths leading\r\ntoward the watering places.[95] The devastation of lands thus caused\r\nin Arizona is almost as great as that which has occurred in the Cotton\r\nstates, as mentioned above chap. 12. p. 217.\r\n\r\n[95] Bull. Arizona Exp’t Station Nos. 2, 38.\r\n\r\nThese variations in the character of the irrigation water must of\r\ncourse be watched by the farmer who does not receive directly from\r\nmountain streams, or from deep artesian wells water known to have a\r\nconstant content of saline matter.\r\n\r\nTHE DUTY OF IRRIGATION WATER.—The amount of water thought to be needed\r\nfor the production of satisfactory crops varies widely in different\r\nregions, ranging all the way from about two feet to as much as eight\r\nannually, within the United States; while in the sugar-cane fields\r\nof the Hawaiian Islands as much as three inches per week, or over\r\ntwelve acre-feet in the course of the year, have been thought to be\r\nbeneficial, if not absolutely required for the best crop results.\r\n\r\nAs has been stated above (chap. 12, p. 215), the rainfall limit below\r\nwhich irrigation becomes, if not absolutely essential, at least a\r\nhighly desirable condition for the safety of crops, is usually assumed\r\nto lie at about 20 inches (500 milimeters). This general statement\r\nis, however, subject to material modification according to the manner\r\nin which the rainfall is distributed. Thus in central Montana with 24\r\ninches of rainfall distributed throughout the year, irrigation is\r\nindispensable; while in the Santa Clara valley of central California,\r\nwith an average rainfall of 15 inches falling through the winter and\r\nspring, the growth of all ordinary field crops has for fifty years\r\nnot failed oftener than is commonly the case in the humid region of\r\nthe North Central states. This is because in California the winter\r\nand spring are the growing seasons, while the rainless summers do not\r\nstand in the way, for crops are already harvested; and the deep rooting\r\nof trees and vines provides these with the needful moisture from the\r\ndepths of the substrata (see chap. 10, pp. 163 to 173).\r\n\r\nIt would thus seem that twenty inches of irrigation water properly\r\napplied ought to be sufficient for all purposes, when added to the\r\nnatural rainfall, which is rarely entirely absent. Yet in actual\r\npractice less than 24 acre-inches is rarely used, and much more is\r\nthe rule; 72 to 96 ins. being sometimes used in Arizona. Evidently\r\nenormous losses occur in practice, and it is of the utmost importance\r\nto discover the causes of these.\r\n\r\n_Causes of Loss._—Since irrigation water is commonly measured at the\r\ndistributing weirs, loss from seepage and evaporation on the way to the\r\nfields is an obvious source of an overestimate of the water actually\r\nsupplied to the farmer. In sandy districts the loss thus incurred is\r\nreliably estimated at nearly 50% in many cases. The apparent duty of\r\nthe water is thus at once reduced to half its effect, and four instead\r\nof two feet of water are supposed to have been used, and are charged\r\nfor.\r\n\r\n_Evaporation_ resulting from surface flooding or use in shallow furrows\r\nmay, again, cause the loss of from 30 to 50% of the water that actually\r\nreaches the land; so that in the latter case, between seepage and\r\nevaporation the irrigator may lose the effect of three-fourths of the\r\nwater he pays for.\r\n\r\n_Loss by Percolation._—Finally, the water may be wasted on the land\r\nitself in leachy soils by over-use, _i. e._, it may percolate to a\r\nlarge extent beyond the reach of the roots when the flow is continued\r\ntoo long; as will always be the case when the head (supply) ditches are\r\nlaid too far apart, so that the water may be wasting into the country\r\ndrainage just below the upper ditch long before the water in the\r\nfurrow reaches the lower one; as illustrated in the upper one of the\r\nsubjoined diagrams. That this will not happen when the head ditches are\r\nnearer together, is shown in the lower diagram.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGS. 46, 47.—Diagram showing loss by percolation when\r\nhead ditches are too far apart.]\r\n\r\nThe means of avoiding the mechanical losses have already been\r\ndiscussed, and may be summarized thus: tightening of leaky ditches; use\r\nof water in deep furrows; and ascertaining the rapidity of percolation\r\n(see p. 242) so as to obtain a proper gauge for the time during which\r\nwater should run, and for the distances at which head ditches or\r\nfurrows should be placed.\r\n\r\nThe importance of thus diminishing the losses of water is obvious when\r\nit is considered that if the duty of water can be reduced to twenty\r\ninstead of forty or fifty acre-inches, twice the area can be irrigated\r\nwith the same amount of water, or the cost of water correspondingly\r\nreduced. It should be noted that when the land is leachy it may be pure\r\nwaste to continue the flow beyond a few hours; but the irrigation must\r\nthen be more frequently repeated.\r\n\r\n\r\nEVAPORATION.\r\n\r\nAlongside of and supplementary to the best possible utilization of\r\nthe rainfall and irrigation water, the prevention of unnecessary\r\nevaporation has to be considered. Evaporation from the soil’s surface\r\nimplies not only unnecessary loss of water that should have remained\r\nfor the use of the crop, but also the depression of temperature which,\r\nas a rule, is unfavorable to the best development of vegetation. It\r\nis only in case of extreme stress from hot, drying wind that such\r\nevaporation and the consequent depression of the temperature of the\r\nsurface soil can be of advantage to the farmer.\r\n\r\nThe amount of water evaporating either from a water-surface, or from a\r\nwet or moist soil, varies greatly according to the climatic conditions,\r\nand the state of the weather; also according to the condition of the\r\nsoil-surface. There are damp climates, and days or periods when,\r\nthe air being nearly saturated with moisture, evaporation even from\r\na water-surface will be almost insensible. On the other hand, with\r\ndry air and a high temperature, enormous quantities of water may be\r\nevaporated in the course of a day. The evaporation from water-surfaces\r\ninterests deeply those who supply, as well as those who are supplied\r\nwith, water from storage reservoirs; evaporation from the soil-surface\r\ninterests deeply all farmers, and more especially irrigators whose\r\nwater-supply is scanty, or is paid for by them by measurement. Light\r\nrains, as well as light surface irrigations, may at times evaporate\r\nalmost wholly without any effect save a lowering of the temperature of\r\nthe soil. In the case of snow, it is a well-known fact in the northern\r\narid regions that a light snowfall may in winter evaporate entirely\r\nwithout imparting any liquid moisture to the soil. A loss of 50% of the\r\nwater actually brought upon land by surface irrigation is of common\r\noccurrence in some portions of the irrigated region.\r\n\r\nThe dependence of evaporation upon air-temperature under conditions\r\notherwise identical, is well illustrated by the experiments made in\r\n1904 by S. Fortier[96] on the Experiment Station grounds at Berkeley,\r\nCalifornia, at a time when under the influence of the sea breeze the\r\naverage saturation of the air might be assumed at about 70%. The tests\r\nwere conducted in six tanks sunk into the ground so as to place the\r\nwater-surfaces on a level with it, and the water-temperatures were\r\nmaintained in four of the tanks by means of ice or heating lamps. The\r\nresults are shown in the following table:\r\n\r\n      SUMMARY OF AVERAGE WEEKLY LOSSES BY EVAPORATION,\r\n    WITH VARYING TEMPERATURES OF WATER, AT BERKELEY, CAL.,\r\n                IN JULY AND AUGUST, 1904.\r\n              =======================+============\r\n               Temperature of water. |  Weekly\r\n                                     |evaporation.\r\n              -----------------------+------------\r\n              Degrees Fahrenheit:    |  Inches.\r\n                  55.5               |   0.42\r\n                  62.0               |   0.77\r\n                  69.2               |   1.54\r\n                  80.1               |   3.08\r\n                  89.2               |   3.92\r\n              -----------------------+------------\r\n\r\n[96] Progress Report on Coöperative Irrigations in Calif.; Cir.

Evaporation from the soil-surface depends largely,\r\nof course, upon the mechanical condition of the surface, the extent\r\nto which it is wetted, and the rapidity with which moisture will be\r\nsupplied from the subsoil as the surface dries. A field plowed into\r\nrough furrows will evaporate more water than when harrowed, because of\r\nthe larger surface exposed; and a harrowed field moderately compacted\r\nby rolling will lose less water by evaporation than when unrolled,\r\nother things being equal. On the other hand, a thoroughly compacted\r\nsurface, even if suffering less loss at first than a plowed or harrowed\r\nfield, will continue to lose moisture longer by withdrawing it from the\r\nsubstrata by its superior capillary suction; while a loose surface,\r\nonce dried out, will prevent farther loss from the subsoil very\r\neffectually, as stated below.\r\n\r\n    TABLE SHOWING EVAPORATION, FROM WATER-SURFACE EXPOSED IN SHALLOW\r\n                TANKS, NEAR WATER OR GROUND SURFACE.\r\n    ===================================+========+====================\r\n                                       | Years. |      Inches.\r\n    -----------------------------------+--------+--------------------\r\n    Rothamsted, England                |    9   | 17.80 (16.6 to 18.4)\r\n    London,        “                   |   14   | 20.66\r\n    Oxford,        “                   |    5   | 31.04\r\n    Munich, Germany                    |    ?   | 24.00\r\n    Emdrup, Denmark                    |   10   | 27.09\r\n    Cambridge, Massachusetts           |    1   | 56.00\r\n    Syracuse, New York                 |    1   | 50.20\r\n    Logan, Utah                        |    1   | 52.39\r\n    Tucson, Arizona                    |    1   | 75.80\r\n    Fort Collins, Colorado             |   11   | 41.00\r\n    Fort Bliss, Texas                  |    1   | 82.70\r\n    San Francisco, California          |        | 45 to 50\r\n    Sweetwater Reservoir,              |        |\r\n           San Diego, California       |    1   | 57.6\r\n    Peking, China                      |    ?   | 38.80\r\n    Demerara, South America            |    3   | 35.12\r\n    Bombay, East India                 |    5   | 82.28\r\n    Petro-Alexandrowsk, West Turkestan |    ?   | 96.40\r\n    Kimberley, South Africa            |    ?   | 98.80\r\n    Alice Springs, South Australia     |    ?   |103.50\r\n    -----------------------------------+--------+--------------------\r\n\r\nThis table, the data for which are taken from various sources,\r\nexhibits clearly the enormous variations in evaporation in different\r\ncountries, and even in localities not very remote from each other. The\r\nlow evaporation near London is doubtless due to its foggy and hazy\r\natmosphere, but it is not clear why Rothamsted should show so low an\r\nevaporation compared with Oxford. Tropical Demerara stands nearest to\r\nOxford in its evaporation; Bombay indicates its location on the hot\r\nand arid west coast of India, despite its nearness to the sea. The\r\ninland localities in the desert regions of South Africa, Australia and\r\nWestern Turkestan, show how enormous may be the losses from evaporation\r\nof irrigation water, unless the latter is applied with special care\r\nfor their prevention. Thus, with the wasteful methods of irrigation\r\nprevailing in portions of the American arid region, it is certain that\r\nin many cases 50% and more of the water evaporates before it reaches\r\nthe crops.\r\n\r\n_Evaporation from Reservoirs and Ditches._—The evaporation from\r\nwater-surfaces especially may, in many cases, exceed the rainfall of\r\nthe year, so as to materially diminish the available water-supply\r\nin reservoirs. Thus the annual evaporation from the reservoir-lakes\r\nforming part of the water-supply of the city of San Francisco, ranges\r\nfrom 40 to 50 inches, while the rainfall averages less than 24 inches.\r\nWere it not, then, for the prevention of evaporation by a covering\r\nof dry earth during summer, no moisture would remain in the ground\r\nto sustain vegetation. In the cool coast climate of Berkeley, Cal.,\r\ndirectly opposite the Golden Gate and subject to its summer fogs,\r\nevaporation from a water-surface maintaining the average climatic\r\ntemperature of 60°, was found to be ¾ inch during the month from\r\nthe middle of July to the middle of August, 1904. But at the high\r\ntemperatures and low degree of air-saturation prevailing in the great\r\ninterior valley, or in the Colorado desert, the evaporation from\r\nwater-surfaces is enormously increased, exceeding even the figure given\r\nin the table for Bombay. Hence the great importance of preventing all\r\navoidable evaporation, particularly in the use of irrigation water.\r\n\r\n_Prevention of Evaporation; Protective Surface Layer._—The loose\r\ntilth of the surface which is so conducive to the rapid absorption of\r\nsurface-water, is also, broadly speaking, the best means of reducing\r\nevaporation to the lowest possible point. For while it is true that the\r\nfloccules of well-tilled soil permit of the ready access of air, and\r\ntherefore of evaporation, it is also true that these relatively coarse\r\ncompound particles are incapable of withdrawing capillary moisture\r\nfrom the denser soil or subsoil underneath; just as a dry sponge is\r\nincapable of absorbing any moisture from a wet brick, while a dry\r\nbrick will readily withdraw nearly all the water contained in the\r\nrelatively large pores of the sponge (see chap. 11). A layer of loose,\r\ndry surface-soil is therefore an excellent preventive of evaporation of\r\nthe moisture from soils, and may be regarded as the natural and most\r\navailable means to be used by the farmer, both for the prevention of\r\nevaporation and to moderate the access of excessive heat and dryness to\r\nthe active roots.\r\n\r\nAs regards the desirable thickness of this protective layer of tilled\r\nsurface-soil, it should be kept in mind that in the humid region, where\r\nrain can be expected at intervals of from one to three weeks, the\r\nfeeding roots may usually be found within a few inches of the surface;\r\nwhile in the arid region, where irrigation is practiced at long\r\nintervals or sometimes not at all, so that no water enters the soil\r\noftener than from two to six months, the roots necessarily vegetate at\r\nlower depths, and hence the protective surface-layer can, and should\r\nbe, of greater thickness, to prevent the penetration of excessive heat\r\nand dryness during the long interval.\r\n\r\nThe failure to appreciate this necessary difference often leads to\r\nheavy losses on the part of newcomers to the arid region, who in this\r\nas in other respects are apt to follow blindly the precepts familiar to\r\nthem in the East, until taught better by sore experience. In the East\r\nand Middle West a depth of three inches is considered the proper one\r\nfor the protective surface-layer; and in the case of maize even this\r\nis considered excessive in many cases. In the arid region this depth\r\nshould be at least doubled where irrigation is not practiced at least\r\nevery four to six weeks; and in some sandy soils even seven and eight\r\ninches is not too much for effective protection.\r\n\r\n_Illustrations of Effects of Surface Tillage._—The efficacy of loose\r\nsurface tilth in preventing evaporation, as compared with mere\r\nsuperficial scratching or with the total omission of cultivation,\r\nis well exemplified in a series of investigations conducted on this\r\nsubject during the extremely dry season of 1898, by the California\r\nExperiment Station; the seasonal rainfall having during that year been\r\non an average from one-third to one-half only of the usual amount, so\r\nas to test to the utmost the endurance of all growing plants. Some\r\nof the details of this investigation have been given above (p. 214)\r\nin connection with the question of moisture requirements of crops.\r\nLoughridge[97] also investigated the moisture conditions in adjacent\r\norchards differently treated in cultivation. In one of these cases\r\ntwo orchards of apricots were separated only by a lane, and the soil\r\nidentical; but one owner had omitted cultivation, while the other had\r\ncultivated to an extra depth in view of the dry season apparently\r\nimpending. The results are best shown by the plates below, showing\r\nrepresentative trees and the annual growth made by each. The table\r\nannexed shows the differences in the moisture-content of the two fields\r\nto the depth of six feet, in July:\r\n\r\n          MOISTURE IN CULTIVATED AND UNCULTIVATED LAND.\r\n    ===================+=====================+==================\r\n                       |     Cultivated.     |  Uncultivated.\r\n      Depth in soil.   +------------+--------+---------+--------\r\n                       | Per cent.  |Tons per|Per cent.|Tons per\r\n                       |            | acre.  |         | acre.\r\n    -------------------+------------+--------+---------+--------\r\n    First foot         |    6.4     |  128   |   4.3   |   86\r\n    Second foot        |    5.8     |  116   |   4.4   |   88\r\n    Third foot         |    6.4     |  128   |   3.9   |   78\r\n    Fourth foot        |    6.5     |  130   |   5.1   |  100\r\n    Fifth foot         |    6.7     |  134   |   3.4   |   68\r\n    Sixth foot         |    6.0     |  120   |   4.5   |   90\r\n                       |    ---     |  ---   |   ---   |  ---\r\n    Total for six foot |    6.3     |  756   |   4.2   |  512\r\n    -------------------+------------+--------+---------+--------\r\n\r\n[97] Rep.

The cause of this difference was that in the _uncultivated_\r\nfield there was a compacted surface-layer of several inches in\r\nthickness, which forcibly abstracted the moisture from the substrata\r\nand evaporated it from its surface; while the loose surface soil on the\r\n_cultivated_ ground was unable to take any moisture from the denser\r\nsubsoil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cultivated.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Uncultivated.\r\n\r\nFIGS. 48, 49.—Apricot Trees, Creek Bench Land, at Niles, Cal.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 50.—New Growth and Fruit on Trees, Cultivated and\r\nUncultivated.

It\r\nmay be added that when, instructed by the season’s experience, the\r\nowner of the “uncultivated” orchard cultivated deeply the following\r\nseason, his trees showed as good growth and fruit as his neighbor’s.\r\n\r\n\r\nEVAPORATION THROUGH THE ROOTS AND LEAVES OF PLANTS.\r\n\r\nUndesirable as is the evaporation from the surface of the soil, under\r\nall but exceptional conditions the evaporation from the leaves of\r\nplants is one of the essential functions of vegetable development. Not\r\nonly because water serves as the vehicle of the plant-food absorbed by\r\nthe roots and to be organized by and redistributed from the leaves,\r\nand the aeration occurring in the latter must of necessity result in\r\na certain degree of evaporation; but largely because the conversion\r\nof liquid water into vapor serves to prevent an injurious rise of\r\ntemperature in the leaves under the influence of hot sunshine and dry\r\nair. It is undoubtedly for the latter purpose that the greater part of\r\nthe enormous amount of water required, as above stated (chap. 11) for\r\nthe production of one part of dry substance, is actually used. When\r\nsufficient water to supply the required evaporation through the leaves\r\ncannot be brought up from the soil, the plant begins to wilt; or in the\r\ncase of some plants with very thin and soft leaves the blade normally\r\nbegins to droop during the hottest hours of the day; thus escaping\r\nexcessive exposure to the sun’s rays, and recovering their turgor later\r\nin the afternoon.\r\n\r\n    The amount of water actually evaporated from orchard\r\n    trees has unfortunately not been directly determined, the\r\n    investigations made in this respect having borne mainly upon\r\n    forest trees. The Austrian Forest Experiment Station made a\r\n    series of elaborate investigations on this subject in 1878,\r\n    and the following data (quoted from the Report of the U.\r\n    S. Dep’t of Agriculture for 1889) convey some idea of the\r\n    results.\r\n\r\n    It was found that the surface-areas of the leaves do not\r\n    give reliable results, but that these depend very largely\r\n    upon the thickness (mass) of the leaves. The dry weight of\r\n    the latter was found, as in the case of field crops, to\r\n    correspond most nearly to the observations made directly.\r\n    It was thus found that _e. g._ birch and linden\r\n    transpired during their annual period of vegetation from\r\n    600 to 700 pounds of water per pound of dry leaves; oaks\r\n    200 to 300, while the figures for ash, beech and maple\r\n    were in between. On the other hand the conifers—spruce,\r\n    fir and pine—ranged, under the same conditions, from 30\r\n    to 70 pounds of water only. In another year, these figures\r\n    were increased for deciduous trees to from 500 to 1000,\r\n    the conifers, 75 to 200 pounds. This great variability\r\n    in different seasons, together with other elements of\r\n    uncertainty, render these figures only roughly approximate;\r\n    but it will be noted that the figures for deciduous trees\r\n    are in general of the same order as those given above for\r\n    field crops. Assuming the evaporation for citrus trees to\r\n    be approximately the same as for the European evergreen oak\r\n    (_Q. cerris_) viz. 500 pounds per pound of dry matter,\r\n    and taking the weighings made by Loughridge of the leaves of\r\n    a 15-year-old orange tree at Riverside as a basis (40 pounds\r\n    of dry leaves), the water evaporated by each such tree would\r\n    be about 20,000 pounds per year, or about 1000 tons per acre\r\n    of 100 trees. This is equivalent to about 9 acre-inches of\r\n    rainfall, out of the 35 inches commonly given.\r\n\r\nSince different plants evaporate very different amounts of water\r\nduring a given time, according to their leaf-surface and the number\r\nand size of their stomates, the maintenance of the equilibrium between\r\nthe soil-supply and the evaporation of the leaf-surface requires\r\ncorrespondingly varying moisture-conditions in the soil. Therefore\r\ndesert plants, with their elaborate structural provisions against\r\nleaf-evaporation, will develop normally, and without wilting, under\r\nconditions which in the case of most culture plants would result in\r\nsevere injury or death. Since diminution of leaf-surface will in all\r\ncases diminish evaporation, the heroic measure of cutting back the\r\ntwigs and branches of shrubs and trees in seasons of severe drought\r\nis sometimes resorted to in order to save their life. In Nature this\r\ndiminution of leaf-surface may be observed in many cases of desert\r\nplants, whose “fugacious” leaves are developed during the rainy season,\r\nin winter and early spring; dropping off so soon as the dry season\r\nbegins, and leaving only the green surface of twigs, stems or spines to\r\nperform the functions of the leaves.\r\n\r\nThe shading of the ground by leafy vegetation will, of course, greatly\r\ndiminish and sometimes suppress evaporation from the soil-surface; thus\r\nvery nearly fulfilling the same conditions referred to above (chap. 7,\r\npage 111) in discussing the effect of natural vegetation in rendering\r\ntillage unnecessary; the beating of rains, and the formation of surface\r\ncrusts, being alike prevented. This fact is of essential importance in\r\ncontributing to the welfare of crops sown broadcast, where subsequent\r\ncultivation is impracticable.\r\n\r\n_Weeds Waste Moisture._—The injurious effects of weedy growth among\r\nculture plants are in most cases due quite as much to the appropriation\r\nof moisture that should have gone to the crop, as to the abstraction\r\nof plant-food, to which the injury is generally attributed. This is\r\nmuch more obvious in the arid region, where during the dry summers\r\nevery pound of moisture counts, than where summer rains obscure this\r\ninfluence. It has led orchardists in California almost to an excess of\r\nclean culture, resulting in the burning-out of the humus from the bare\r\nsurface-soil during the long, hot summers, and an injurious compacting\r\nimpossible to remedy by the most careful tillage. It thus happens\r\nthat green-manuring, the natural remedy for this evil, cannot safely\r\nbe done there with summer crops, but must be accomplished with winter\r\ncrops, such as can be turned under before the dry season begins. The\r\nsame objection holds against the growing of summer crops between the\r\norchard-rows.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION OF MOISTURE IN THE SOIL AS AFFECTED BY VEGETATION.\r\n\r\nThe investigations of Wollny and others have long shown quantitatively\r\nwhat common experience has taught the farmer, viz., that a field in\r\ncrops or grass is always drier within the soil-mass penetrated by the\r\nroots than is a cultivated field bare of crops, unless perhaps when\r\nheavily crusted on the surface. The depletion of moisture caused by\r\ngrass sward is the most easily observed because of the shallowness\r\nof the root-system; and this is one cause at least why grass sward\r\ndoes not occur naturally in the arid region, and when planted cannot\r\nbe maintained without irrigation repeated at short intervals.\r\nDeeper-rooted plants of course deplete the soil at different and\r\nvarying levels; and where surface roots are few or absent it may\r\nreadily happen that the surface soil is moister than the subsoil.\r\n\r\n    This was very strikingly shown by the investigations of\r\n    Ototzky in the South-Russian steppes, in comparing both the\r\n    moisture contents and the depth of bottom water as between\r\n    forest land and the open plains. On the steppe near Chipoff,\r\n    Government of Voronej, he found the ground water at from 3\r\n    to 5 meters (10-16 feet) depth; under the forest in the same\r\n    region and in identical underground formations, the water\r\n    level stood at 15 meters. In the Black Forest near Cherson,\r\n    the water is found at about 15 feet beneath the surface;\r\n    under the steppe and in cultivated ground it stood at 10\r\n    feet. At the same time the forest soil was moister in the\r\n    upper two feet than the soil of the steppe, where surface\r\n    evaporation (partly through shallow plant-roots, partly\r\n    direct) was greater than under the shadow of the forest;\r\n    under which, moreover, there were few shallow rooted plants\r\n    to draw upon the moisture of the surface soil.\r\n\r\nThe great evaporation from forests is a matter demonstrated by actual\r\nmeasurement; hence it is not surprising that certain shallow-rooted\r\ntrees should serve for the reclamation of wet ground, as has been\r\ndemonstrated on the large scale, _e. g._, in the use of the eucalyptus\r\nin the Pontine Marshes of Italy, and of the maritime pine in the Landes\r\nof western France. Thus the sanitation of swampy districts through\r\ntree-planting has become one of the established measures in their\r\nsettlement. But this refers only to the evaporation from the trees\r\nthemselves; for in the shade of the forest, a free water-surface is\r\nfound to evaporate on the average only one-third as much as in open\r\nground. Of course there must be a correspondingly great difference in\r\nthe amounts of evaporation from the soil-surfaces in the respective\r\nareas.\r\n\r\nThe great draft made by the _Eucalyptus globulus_ upon soil-moisture\r\nhas been also abundantly shown in California, where on account of its\r\nrapid growth this tree has been largely used for windbreaks. It was\r\nfound that the trees deplete the fields of moisture for from twenty to\r\nthirty feet on either side, so as to materially reduce crops within\r\nthat limit. For this reason the pine and cypress has of late found\r\ngreater acceptance for this purpose.\r\n\r\n_Mulching._—Covering the soil with straw or similar loose materials\r\nto prevent waste of moisture is a common garden practice everywhere,\r\nalthough not usually applicable on the large scale. It may readily\r\nhowever, be carried to excess, in preventing not only evaporation but\r\nalso the warming of the soil which is so needful to the thrifty growth\r\nof plants. It must not therefore be done too early in the season; and\r\nafter cold rains it sometimes becomes necessary to remove the mulch in\r\norder to allow the ground to become properly warmed. Mulching in early\r\nspring is often used to retard blooming of trees where spring frosts\r\nare feared.\r\n\r\nIn the arid region, sanding of the surface is sometimes resorted to\r\nfor the prevention of the evaporation which brings alkali salts to the\r\nsurface. But the necessity of repeating this dressing annually unless\r\ncultivation can be omitted, restricts the use of this expedient to\r\nnarrow limits.\r\n\r\nThe sanding of the surface of cranberry plantations in swamps or bogs\r\nin the northern parts of the humid region doubtless owes its efficacy\r\nlargely, if not chiefly, to the retention of moisture, while at the\r\nsame time it prevents the consolidation of the surface, so as to render\r\ntillage unnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nABSORPTION BY SOILS OF SOLIDS FROM SOLUTIONS. ABSORPTION OF GASES. AIR\r\nOF THE SOILS.\r\n\r\n\r\nABSORPTION OF SOLIDS FROM THEIR SOLUTIONS.\r\n\r\nJust as solids have the power of condensing gases upon their surfaces,\r\nto an extent proportional to that surface, and therefore to the state\r\nof fine division: so fine powders have the power of withdrawing from\r\nsolutions solids held in solution, to an extent varying with the\r\nnature of the substance dissolved, and the absorbing solid. The most\r\ncommonly-known manifestation of this principle is that sea-water\r\nfiltering through the sands of the shore, will at a certain distance\r\nbecome sensibly less brackish, and finally so nearly fresh as to be\r\ncapable of domestic use.[98] The extent to which this occurs is in a\r\nmeasure proportional to the fineness of the sand, and to the amount of\r\nclay present in it. This is a clearly physical effect, independent of\r\nany chemical action whatever; for it occurs equally with quartz sand,\r\ncharcoal, glass, limestone, or other rock powders having no chemical\r\neffect upon the substance dissolved or upon the liquid dissolving\r\nit. Very large amounts of water are often required to remove all the\r\nsoluble matter thus “adsorbed.”\r\n\r\n[98] In many cases this decrease of salinity is probably due to a slow\r\ninflux of fresh water from landward; but very often it cannot be thus\r\nexplained.\r\n\r\n_Decolorizing Action._—One of the commonest applications of this\r\nprinciple is the decolorization of colored solutions by means of finely\r\npulverized charcoal. This property of charcoal, as is well known, is\r\nextensively utilized in the arts, and particularly in the refining of\r\nsugar; the charcoal used in this case being preferably bone charcoal\r\n(“bone black”), which on account of its state of extreme fineness, and\r\nseparation by the earthy particles with which it is associated, is more\r\neffective than any other form. It is rendered still more effective,\r\nhowever, by the extraction of these earthy particles (calcic carbonate\r\nand phosphate) by means of acid; for by removal of the earthy\r\nparticles, the surface of the charcoal is greatly increased, and its\r\ndecolorizing as well as its absorbing power increases accordingly.\r\n\r\nWhile in one and the same substance the decolorizing effect is more\r\nor less directly proportional to the fineness of the particles,\r\ncorresponding to increased surface, it is nevertheless true that in\r\nthis case, as in that of the absorption of gases, there are specific\r\ndifferences between different powders; so that for example no other\r\nsubstance can replace charcoal in the decolorizing effect which it\r\nproduces upon colored solutions. It must not, however, be supposed that\r\nthere is any special reason why _coloring_ matters, as such, should be\r\ntaken up by preference. Coloring matters are of all kinds of chemical\r\ncomposition, and have in common only the fact that a relatively small\r\namount produces a very strong coloring effect; hence their name, and\r\nhence also the apparently extraordinarily strong effect produced upon\r\nthem by charcoal.\r\n\r\nThis effect is not, however, by any means greater than it is in the\r\ncase of many other compounds which are colorless.\r\n\r\n_Complex Action of Soils._—The powdery ingredients of soils, of course,\r\nshare this power with all other powders. In the case of soils, however,\r\nthe action is almost always much more complex than in that of charcoal,\r\nbecause solutions that are passed through the soil are apt to act\r\nchemically upon one or the other of its ingredients, usually resulting\r\nin a partial exchange of ingredients between the soil and the solution;\r\none or more of the constituents of the solution being retained by the\r\nsoil, while one or more of the (basic) soil constituents pass into the\r\nsolution, in combination with its acidic ingredients.\r\n\r\n    Thus when a very dilute (½ or 1%) solution of potassic\r\n    chlorid is filtered through almost any soil, the first\r\n    portions passing through will be practically free from\r\n    potash, but will contain the chlorids of calcium and\r\n    magnesium. But as more of the solution is passed through,\r\n    potash passes also ultimately without absorption. In\r\n    addition to the zeolitic and clay portions of the soil, the\r\n    humus is very effective in absorbing mineral ingredients\r\n    from solution, and retaining them in such manner as to be\r\n    readily available to plant growth. (See chap. 8, p. 124.)\r\n\r\nIn view of the almost invariable conjunction of physical and chemical\r\neffects, it may be fairly said that no solution, at least of mineral\r\nsalts, can pass through the soil without being changed in its\r\nconcentration and chemical composition. It is sometimes difficult to\r\ndecide to which of the two classes of effects the several changes may\r\nbe due.\r\n\r\n_Purifying Action of Soils._—The disinfecting action of dry soil,\r\nabsorbing offensive gases from manure piles and from earth closets, has\r\nalready been alluded to. Similarly it is a matter of common experience\r\nthat the colored and otherwise offensive drainage from manure piles,\r\ntanneries, dyeworks, etc., is not only deodorized but also decolorized\r\nwhen passed through a sufficiently thick layer of clay soil. The\r\nfiltration through fine sand by which the drinking waters of cities\r\nare so commonly purified before delivery to the consumer are familiar\r\nexamples of the same effects.\r\n\r\nEqually familiar, however, is the fact that this power of\r\ndecolorization and retention of offensive compounds is limited; that\r\nafter a while the filtering earth or sand becomes saturated, and\r\nafterwards the water or drainage will pass through without any sensible\r\npurification.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore clear that this purifying effect of earth cannot\r\nbe relied upon for the permanent protection of wells from the\r\nsurface-drainage from barnyard or house refuse. Even if fissures or\r\nlayers of sand or gravel should not intervene so as to permit of the\r\ndirect communication of surface-drainage with wells, it is certain that\r\nin the course of a few years at most, the intervening earth will become\r\nso far saturated with the noxious ingredients that the latter will pass\r\nthrough unhindered, and may contaminate to a considerable extent the\r\ndomestic supply of drinking water.\r\n\r\n_Waste of Fertilizers._—The same, of course, holds true in regard to\r\nmanure-water, or soluble fertilizers of any kind used on the soil of\r\na field. The soil will retain them to a certain extent; but beyond\r\nthat limit any surplus added will be quickly washed through into the\r\ncountry drainage by the rains. Moreover, a soil once so saturated\r\nwill yield to rain water filtering through it, notable amounts of all\r\nthe ingredients absorbed in it; and, at least so far as the physically\r\ncondensed soluble ingredients are concerned, long-continued leaching\r\nwith pure water will inevitably result in the withdrawal of additional\r\namounts of absorbed ingredients, apparently dividing themselves up _pro\r\nrata_ between the water and the soil.\r\n\r\nIt is obviously of the utmost importance to the farmer to know to what\r\nextent the soil will retain manurial ingredients against the influence\r\nof leaching rains; for unless this is taken into consideration, it may\r\nreadily happen that the fertilizer supplied before a rainy season will\r\nbe washed through beyond the reach of plant-roots, and so practically\r\nbecome a dead loss.\r\n\r\n_Absorptive Power Varies._—So far as the mere physical absorption is\r\nconcerned, it will readily be understood that a coarse sandy soil\r\nexercises less retentive influence upon dissolved substances than clay\r\nor humous soils. In the humid region, where sand is substantially\r\nnothing but granular silica (see above, chap. 6, page 86), the same may\r\nbe measurably true as regards the chemical absorption also. In the arid\r\nregion, on the contrary, a great many sandy or silt soils, very poor in\r\nclay, exert fully as much chemical absorption as clay soils, and are\r\nno more liable to the washing-out of soluble fertilizers introduced\r\nthan are the latter. For the chemical absorption lies chiefly in the\r\nzeolitic portion of the soil (see above chap. 3, p. 37), which in the\r\nhumid region accumulates in the clay, while in the arid it remains\r\nencrusting the sand and silt grains.\r\n\r\n_Generalities regarding Chemical Absorption and Exchange._—In regard to\r\nthe leaching-out and absorption or retention of substances important to\r\nagriculture, the following general statement may be made:\r\n\r\nThe substances most likely to be leached out of soils are, of bases:\r\nsoda, magnesia and lime; of acidic constituents: chlorine, sulfuric\r\nacid and nitric acid. Lime sometimes passes off with either of the\r\nabove acidic ingredients, and also in the form of carbonate.\r\n\r\nSubstances rather tenaciously retained in soils are: potash and ammonia\r\namong the bases, and phosphoric acid among the acids.\r\n\r\nThus (as stated above) when a weak (one or two per cent) solution\r\nof potassic chlorid or sulfate is poured upon a column of good soil\r\nseveral inches thick, it will be found that the first portions passing\r\nthrough are free from potash, but contain the chlorids or sulfates of\r\nmagnesium and calcium. If potassic nitrate be used, lime and magnesia\r\nwill pass off as nitrates; while in the case of potassic phosphate,\r\nboth ingredients will be retained. A solution of gypsum (calcic\r\nsulfate) will usually cause the passing-off of some of the magnesia,\r\nsoda and potash contained in the soil, in the form of sulfates; but\r\nthe amount of potash thus dissolved soon diminishes to a mere trace.\r\nSolutions of potassic or amnionic phosphates will be absorbed and\r\nretained by the soil to a very considerable extent, before the soil\r\nbecomes saturated.\r\n\r\nWhile it is true that the degree to which the soil retains the several\r\ningredients may serve in a very general way to indicate their richness\r\nor poverty in the same, the attempt to make such experiments serve\r\nto determine the agricultural needs of soils has met with but little\r\npractical acceptance.\r\n\r\n_Drain Waters._—The table on p. 22, chapter 2, illustrates forcibly the\r\nworking of the above principles, which are verified by the composition\r\nof drain-waters. In all, the chief nutritive ingredients of plants,\r\nexcept nitrogen, are present in traces only; chlorids, nitrates and\r\nsulfates of sodium and magnesium form the bulk of the permanently\r\nsoluble matter, with usually a considerable proportion of calcic (and\r\nmagnesic) carbonate, depending upon the amount of the earth-carbonates\r\npresent in the soil, as well as upon that of oxidizable organic\r\nmatter from which carbonic acid can be formed. That calcic carbonate\r\nfilters readily through the soil has already been somewhat elaborately\r\ndiscussed (see chap. 3, p. 41); one of the results being that the\r\nsurface soil is sometimes almost completely depleted of this important\r\nsubstance, while it accumulates at a greater or less depth in the\r\nsubsoil, or in underdrains, as the case may be.\r\n\r\nOf the ingredients appearing in the above list, the one of greatest\r\nagricultural importance is nitric acid, since chlorine and sulfuric\r\nacid, as well as soda, are required only in very small quantities\r\nby most culture plants; so that they rarely need to be supplied\r\nin fertilizers. Nitric acid, however, is not only one of the most\r\nimportant fertilizers, but also the most expensive; hence the\r\npassing-off of nitrates in drainage-water is of such serious concern\r\nto the farmer, that the causes of its occurrence, and the means of\r\npreventing such loss, should be fully understood. This subject will,\r\nhowever, be more fully considered farther on.\r\n\r\n_The above Distinctions not Absolute._—It should, however, be also\r\nunderstood that while the above statements hold good in a general way,\r\nyet the line drawn is by no means an absolute one. For just as in the\r\ncase of physical adsorption the long passing-through of distilled water\r\nwill gradually abstract the substances condensed on the surface of\r\nthe soil-grains, so an overwhelming amount of a solution of any one\r\nkind will have a tendency to substitute its own ingredients for those\r\nalready present in the soil, removing the latter to a greater or less\r\nextent, even in the case of potash and phosphoric acid.\r\n\r\n    As an example in point, may be cited the case of the natural\r\n    minerals Analcite and Leucite, which Lemberg was able to\r\n    reciprocally transform from their natural condition of\r\n    soda- and potash-alumina silicates merely by alternate\r\n    treatment with solutions of potassium and sodium chlorids\r\n    respectively. (See chap. 3, p. 37). The same is true in\r\n    the case of the zeolitic matter of the soil. There is\r\n    nevertheless a distinct preference in the direction of the\r\n    retention of potash as against soda; so that in the case\r\n    of alkali soils, a large excess of potash is found to be\r\n    present in the zeolitic form, notwithstanding the presence\r\n    of sometimes very large amounts of the chlorid, sulfate and\r\n    carbonate of soda. This preferable retention of potash is,\r\n    of course, of material advantage in the case of the use of\r\n    soluble potash-fertilizers, as well as in preventing the\r\n    waste of the potash of the soil itself.\r\n\r\n\r\nABSORPTION, OR CONDENSATION, OF GASES BY SOILS.\r\n\r\nLike all bodies in a state of fine division, soils are capable of\r\nabsorbing a not inconsiderable amount of various gases. It may be said\r\nthat in general, other things being equal, the amount thus condensed on\r\nthe surface of the soil-grains is more or less directly proportional\r\nto the facility with which the gas is condensed by either pressure or\r\ncooling. Hence the very large amount of water-gas or vapor which may\r\nbe absorbed by soils, as shown in a preceding chapter. But excepting\r\nperhaps the case of ammonia, moist soils are less absorbent of gases\r\nthan dry ones.\r\n\r\nOxygen and nitrogen, the main constituents of the atmosphere, being\r\ndifficultly condensable by either pressure or cold, are absorbed by\r\nsoils only to a relatively small, yet by no means unimportant extent.\r\nThe condensation of oxygen within the soil-mass is doubtless of\r\nconsiderable importance in the processes of oxidation, as is shown by\r\nits partial replacement by carbonic gas in the free air of the soil\r\n(see chap. 2, p. 17). The intensifying of oxidizing action caused by\r\nsurface condensation is well illustrated in the case of finely divided\r\nplatinum, in which hydrogen is brought to rapid combustion when mixed\r\nwith oxygen; as well as by the effect of bedding tainted meat in\r\ncharcoal powder, when all odors of decay disappear, both by absorption\r\nand oxidation, ammonia and carbonic gas alone ultimately escaping\r\nthrough the powder.\r\n\r\n_Carbonic dioxid and ammonia gases_, both normal constituents of the\r\natmosphere, and of high importance to plant nutrition, are more readily\r\ncondensable than either oxygen or nitrogen, and consequently may be\r\ntaken up by the soil in larger relative proportions. Especially is\r\nthis the case with ammonia gas, which is not only readily condensed by\r\npressure, but is also extremely soluble in water; so much so that it\r\nrushes into a tube filled with this gas almost as quickly as though\r\nit were a vacuum. Water will absorb at the ordinary temperature,\r\nunder normal pressure, about 700 times its volume of ammonia gas; but\r\ninasmuch as the proportion of the latter in the atmosphere amounts\r\nto only a few millionths, the actual amount taken up can only (as\r\nin the case of all gases) be proportional to its proportion (or\r\n“partial pressure”) multiplied into its coefficient of absorption.\r\nConsequently, water exposed to the ordinary air can absorb at best only\r\na small fraction of a per cent of ammonia. Its presence in soils can\r\nbe readily demonstrated by passing through the warmed soil a current\r\nof purified air, which is made to bubble through Nessler’s reagent\r\n(potassio-mercuric iodid) solution.\r\n\r\n_Absorption of gases by dry soils._—Perfectly dry soils are powerful\r\nabsorbers of ammonia, and their absorption of this gas, as well as of\r\ncarbonic gas, can readily be shown by the arrangement shown on the page\r\nopposite.\r\n\r\n    The two tubes shown to the left are filled with carbonic\r\n    gas, those to the right with ammonia gas. After being\r\n    immersed in a mercurial trough, there are introduced into\r\n    each tube through the mercury small cylinders (conveniently\r\n    one cubic centimeter in volume) consisting respectively of\r\n    a very sandy soil or loose hardpan, a gray plastic clay,\r\n    a gray clay soil or adobe, a very black “adobe” clay, and\r\n    a highly ferruginous and humous soil (from Hawaii), which\r\n    gives the highest absorption of all; next brown peat, and\r\n    pine charcoal. The latter, and the ferruginous soil, were\r\n    also exposed for the absorption of carbonic gas. All the\r\n    absorbing cylinders are first heated for an hour to 110°C.\r\n    (218°F) for the purpose of expelling from them moisture,\r\n    air, and other absorbed gases. They are then quickly\r\n    introduced into the tubes through the mercury and allowed to\r\n    absorb the gases enclosed until the mercury columns cease to\r\n    show any farther rise; in which condition they are shown in\r\n    the figure.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that this absorption is a different one, not only\r\nfor each of the different substances used, but is also differently\r\nproportioned for the two gases. For it will be noted that while the\r\nclay soil has absorbed a very much larger amount of ammonia than the\r\ncharcoal, and the sandy soil has remained far behind both: yet the\r\ncharcoal has absorbed a considerably larger _proportion_ of carbonic\r\ngas than either the clay or the sandy soil, proving that charcoal has\r\na strong _specific_ absorptive power for carbonic gas, independently\r\nof the relative size of clay and charcoal particles respectively.\r\nThe sandy soil shows, by its low absorption even of ammonia gas,\r\nthe coarseness of its particles and the scarcity of clay in its\r\ncomposition. The highest absorption of all is shown by the ferruginous\r\nsoil from Hawaii, containing nearly 40% of ferric oxid together with\r\n3⅓% of humus. The moisture-absorption of this soil at the ordinary\r\ntemperature is 19.7 per cent. The difference in the absorbing power\r\nof the (non-humous) gray clay and gray adobe soil indicates the\r\nstrong influence of humus upon the absorption; which is still farther\r\nemphasized by the difference between the gray and black adobe, the\r\nlatter containing 1.2% of humus. As to the peat, since its weight was\r\nonly .5 grams against an average of 2 grams for the soils employed, its\r\nabsorptive power _by weight_ doubtless exceeds all other substances.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 51.—Absorption of Carbonic and Ammonia Gases by\r\ndifferent Soils.]\r\n\r\nWhile the experiment shown in the figure serves as a convenient and\r\nstriking demonstration for lecture purposes, it is of course not\r\nadapted to a direct comparison of the absorbing powers of the several\r\nsubstances, because of different heights of the mercurial columns\r\ncounteracting the atmospheric pressure. For direct comparative\r\nmeasurement the tubes must be sunk in mercury so as to equalize the\r\nlevels inside and outside, since the corrected volumes obtained by\r\ncalculation would not serve the purpose.\r\n\r\nAccording to special measurements made under normal atmospheric\r\npressure, the writer found that a black clay soil (“adobe”) absorbed\r\n(at 60°F) over two hundred times its bulk of ammonia gas, while under\r\nthe pressure of one-fifth of an atmosphere (as shown in the photograph)\r\nthe absorption was one hundred and twenty-three times its bulk. This\r\nenergetic absorption of ammonia and related gases explains the marked\r\ndisinfecting effects which a covering of dry earth exerts in the case\r\nof cemeteries, manure piles, and earth closets. But the difference\r\nbetween the sandy soil and the clay soil in the amount of absorption\r\nadmonishes us that in all these cases, to secure disinfection the earth\r\nto be used should contain as much clay as possible, and should not be\r\nmere sand, as is sometimes the case. It also shows that the addition\r\nof charcoal to such materials does not increase their efficacy, as has\r\nbeen supposed, but that an equal bulk of clay would be more efficient.\r\n\r\nOf course, so soon as the absorbing cylinders used for this experiment\r\nare exposed to the atmosphere, the principle above stated in regard to\r\n“partial pressure” asserts itself. The absorbed gases quickly begin\r\nto be given off, and in some hours the equilibrium with the ordinary\r\nconditions of the atmosphere is re-established. That the strong\r\nabsorptive power of soils for ammonia is to some extent effective\r\nin maintaining the supply of this substance by absorption from the\r\natmosphere, cannot be doubted.\r\n\r\nBoussingault, and later Stenhouse, determined the absorptive power of\r\nwood charcoal for ammonia to be 90 and 98 volumes respectively.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COMPOSITION OF GASES ABSORBED FROM THE ATMOSPHERE BY VARIOUS SOLIDS.\r\n\r\nIn 1864 and 1865 Reichardt and Blumtritt[99] investigated elaborately\r\nthe composition of gases driven off by heat from various powders,\r\nincluding soils, exposed to the atmosphere. All the substances examined\r\nwere therefore “air-dry,” therefore to a certain extent moist; and\r\nthe presence of this aqueous vapor of course modifies in a measure\r\nthe results that would have been obtained had the materials used been\r\nexposed to dry air only. They found that, as had already been stated\r\nby previous observers, the presence of capillary water _diminishes_\r\nmaterially the absorption of gases, especially of those not as easily\r\nabsorbed by water as are carbonic gas and ammonia. Contrary to what\r\nmight have been expected from the more ready condensation of oxygen by\r\npressure or cold, in nearly all cases nitrogen is absorbed to a greater\r\nextent than oxygen, and sometimes exclusively so; so that in some cases\r\nthe latter was found to be present only in traces, as will be perceived\r\nfrom the subjoined table:\r\n\r\n    COMPOSITION OF GASES ABSORBED FROM

98, p. 167.\r\n\r\n    _Discussion of the Table._—It will be observed that\r\n    in this table, the largest amount of total gas given off\r\n    by equal weights of any one substance was in the case of\r\n    carbonate of magnesia; but it is quite probable that in\r\n    part, at least, this large amount of gas was due to the\r\n    evolution of carbonic gas from the easily decomposable\r\n    carbonate; the more as the analysis of the gases shows over\r\n    29% of carbonic gas. But the highest absorption by equal\r\n    _volumes_ of any substance is shown by the ferric\r\n    hydrate; next to this by the light poplar charcoal, and\r\n    next by the carbonate of magnesia. The high absorptive\r\n    power here shown by the ferric hydrate is of great interest\r\n    in connection with the facts already stated regarding the\r\n    absorption of moisture and ammonia by ferruginous soils\r\n    (see page 274, this chapter); and the fact that the larger\r\n    proportion of the gas—as much as 70% in one case—consisted\r\n    of carbonic gas, is particularly interesting in the same\r\n    connection. Both in the amount of gas contained, and in\r\n    the proportion of carbonic gas therein, the ferric hydrate\r\n    exceeds even peat, the representative of humus in soils.\r\n    It will, however, be noted that in the garden soil, also,\r\n    the proportion of carbonic gas is very large, while that of\r\n    oxygen is very low. It is curious to note that in very few\r\n    cases the proportion of oxygen to nitrogen is the same as\r\n    in the atmosphere; in most cases the nitrogen predominates\r\n    considerably beyond its normal proportion, and in two cases,\r\n    that of charcoal and of calcic carbonate (whiting), the gas\r\n    was found to consist of pure nitrogen.\r\n\r\nWe are forced to conclude that the substances here enumerated, as a\r\nrule, condense oxygen in smaller proportions than they do nitrogen, or\r\ncarbonic gas. As regards the carbon monoxid mentioned in the table, it\r\nis doubtful that it was contained as such in the substance originally\r\nexamined; it may readily have been formed under the influence of the\r\nheat required in expelling the gases from the substances containing\r\norganic matter. Among the important results shown in the table, is the\r\ncomparative determination of the gases in moist, and in dry garden\r\nearth, showing that in the moist earth the amount of gas absorbed\r\nranged from less than one-half down to almost one-fourth that absorbed\r\nby the dry. The importance of these differences in the case of the\r\nfallow can readily be appreciated.\r\n\r\n    The changes in the absorptive power brought about by\r\n    wetting and drying, as shown in the above table, are very\r\n    insignificant. In the case of the charcoal, soil and silt\r\n    the diminution may fairly be assumed to be caused by the\r\n    deposition of soluble salts on the surface, partly clogging\r\n    the pores. In the case of the clay as well as in that of\r\n    the river silt, the inevitable content of organic matter\r\n    in process of decomposition has doubtless influenced the\r\n    result, as is suggested by the increase of carbonic gas.\r\n    That prepared chalk should in one case contain exclusively\r\n    nitrogen gas, in the other case mixed gases, seems to\r\n    indicate a difference in the air to which it is exposed,\r\n    or in the water employed in its preparation; the latter\r\n    case agreeing substantially with the results obtained from\r\n    the precipitated carbonate. In both (as well as in the\r\n    carbonates of barium and strontium), the absorption of\r\n    carbonic gas is very small, or _nil_.\r\n\r\nIt thus appears that for the condensation of carbonic dioxid gas,\r\nferric and aluminic hydrates are prepotent among mineral substances;\r\nwhile clays, river silts and soils may always be expected to contain\r\nrelatively large proportions of this gas in absorption.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AIR OF SOILS.\r\n\r\n_The Empty Space in Soils._—In dry soils the empty space, usually\r\namounting to from 35 to 50 per cent of its volume, is filled with\r\nair;[100] in moist or wet soils the space unoccupied by water is\r\nsimilarly filled. Hence when soils are in their best condition for\r\nthe support of vegetation (chap. 11, p. 202), about one half of their\r\ninterstices is filled with water, the other half with air. Actual\r\nmeasurements of the amount of air contained in well-cultivated garden\r\nsoil have been shown by Boussingault and Levy to range between 10,000\r\nand 12,000 cubic feet per acre, substantially agreeing, therefore, with\r\nthe above statement. In uncultivated forest soil, on the contrary, they\r\nfound only from somewhat less than 4000 to 6000 cubic feet of air per\r\nacre. Extended observations since carried out by Wollny, Ebermayer, and\r\nothers have in general confirmed the earlier observations, while adding\r\ngreatly to their significance in respect to their relations to plant\r\ngrowth, and to the process of humification and soil-formation.\r\n\r\n[100] The normal composition of atmospheric air is given on p. 16,\r\nchap. 2.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of course, when water evaporates from the soil in drying,\r\nits place is taken by air so far as it is not filled by capillary water\r\ndrawn from below.\r\n\r\n_Functions of Air in Soils._—That roots require for the performance of\r\ntheir vegetative functions the presence of oxygen, has already been\r\ndiscussed; but there can be no question that the higher productiveness\r\nof well-cultivated soils is largely due to the greater and readier\r\naccess of air to the roots. Apart from this direct function, however,\r\nthe presence of oxygen in the soil serves other important purposes,\r\nand among these doubtless the most dominant is the promotion of the\r\noxidation of the organic matter of the soil through the agency of\r\nmicro-organisms; and more particularly that of nitrification, which\r\nchiefly governs the supply of nitrogen to non-leguminous plants. In\r\nthe case of leguminous plants, the presence of air as a furnisher of\r\nnitrogen as well as oxygen is absolutely essential.\r\n\r\nThe injurious effects of insufficient aeration of the soil have been\r\nrepeatedly referred to already (pp. 45, 76). In water-logged soils\r\nreductive fermentations are soon set up, and the nitrates of the\r\nsoils are reduced partly with the evolution of nitrogen gas, partly\r\nto ammonia; while their oxygen is consumed to supply the demands of\r\nthe roots. Ferric oxid is reduced to ferrous carbonate, sulfates to\r\nsulfids; thus deranging the whole process of plant-nutrition and\r\nabsorption of plant-food. If continued for any length of time these\r\nconditions end in the death of the plant. Too much importance cannot\r\ntherefore be attached to the proper aeration of the soil and subsoil.\r\n\r\n_Excessive Aeration; Compacting the Soil._—On the other hand, excessive\r\naeration of the soil may be injurious in causing a serious waste of\r\nmoisture; especially in arid climates, where the hot, dry winds may\r\nreadily destroy the germinating power of the swollen seed when the\r\nseed-bed is too loose and open, and later may injure or destroy the\r\nfeeding roots. The abundant growth of grain often seen in the tracks\r\nof a wagon carrying the centrifugal sower, when the stand in the\r\ngeneral surface is very scanty, is usually due to the consolidation of\r\nthe seed-bed, and suggests at once the well-known efficacy of light\r\nrolling to insure quicker germination and a better stand. Similarly,\r\nthe rolling of grain fields in spring is often the saving clause for\r\na crop in dry years. But such needful consolidation must not, of\r\ncourse, be carried to the extent of creating a surface crust which\r\nwould subsequently serve to waste the subsoil moisture. Hence, the\r\nsoil-surface should be rather dry when rolling is resorted to.\r\n\r\nThe pressing of the earth around transplanted plants, similarly, is\r\na needful precaution, not only with respect to the drying-out of the\r\nsoil, but also to insure close contact between the roots and the soil.\r\n\r\n_The Composition of the Free Air of the Soil_ usually differs from\r\nthe air above, in that besides being saturated with moisture, its\r\nnitrogen-content is slightly increased (by one-half to over one per\r\ncent); the oxygen-content on the other hand, is diminished, being\r\nin part (sometimes nearly to the extent of one-half of its volume)\r\nreplaced by carbonic gas, derived partly from its secretion by the\r\nroots, partly from the oxidation of organic substances. It naturally\r\nfollows that the richer the soil in the latter, the more carbonic gas\r\nwill be formed under favoring conditions; so that in freshly-manured\r\nland the amount of oxygen transformed into carbonic gas will be\r\ngreatest, while in the surface-soil of ordinary fields, carbonic gas\r\nrarely reaches to as much as one per cent. In all cases, however, the\r\ncontent of carbonic gas in the air of the soil is materially higher\r\nthan that of the air above it, and thus serves to intensify greatly\r\nthe solvent and disintegrating effect of the soil water upon the soil\r\nmaterials (see chap. 2, p. 17). The soil-mass itself, however, retains\r\ncarbonic dioxid with considerable tenacity, so that it is not possible\r\nto wash it out completely by filtering water through it. When water\r\ncontaining carbonic gas in solution is filtered through the soil, the\r\ngas is sometimes completely absorbed, the water passing off free from\r\ngas.\r\n\r\nThe presence of free carbonic gas in soils is readily demonstrated by\r\npassing through the warmed soil a current of air, which is then made to\r\nbubble through lime water; a clouding of the latter, and the ultimate\r\nformation of a precipitate of calcic carbonate, proves the presence of\r\nthe gas, and may also serve to measure its amount.\r\n\r\nFrom the fact that the free air in normal soils may contain as much as\r\none-fortieth of its bulk of carbonic gas, besides what may be contained\r\nin the condensed form, we may conclude that this gas is formed within\r\nthem with considerable rapidity; for otherwise, in view of the free\r\ncommunication and diffusion with the outer air, such large amounts\r\ncould not be maintained in the surface-soil. Doubtless a considerable\r\nproportion of the carbonic gas normally contained in the atmosphere is\r\nthus supplied from within the soil itself.\r\n\r\n_Relation of Carbonic Gas to Bacterial and Fungous Activity._—It has\r\nbeen fully demonstrated by the researches of Koch, Miquel, Adametz,\r\nFuelles, Wollny and others, that the formation of carbonic gas in the\r\nsoil is not a purely chemical oxidation process, but is essentially\r\ndependent upon the presence and life-activity of numerous kinds of\r\norganisms, bacterial as well as fungous. The crucial proof of this fact\r\nis that the presence of any antiseptic diminishes, and if exceeding\r\ncertain proportions completely suppresses, the formation of carbonic\r\ngas; while on the other hand all conditions known to be favorable to\r\nthe life of such organisms, viz., the proper conditions of temperature\r\nand moisture (varying with different kinds), increase the formation\r\nof the gas. Such formation is of course, however, conditioned upon\r\nthe presence of oxygen. In the case of most bacteria, there is a\r\ncertain limit beyond which the presence of their own product exerts\r\nan injurious or repressive effect upon their activity; so that if the\r\ngas accumulates beyond that limit, the rate of its formation decreases\r\ndespite of otherwise favorable conditions.\r\n\r\nIt follows that the best life-conditions of these organisms (even\r\nwhen anerobic) cannot be fulfilled below a certain limited depth in\r\nthe soil; and all observations show that their number decreases very\r\nrapidly with increasing depth (see chap. 9, p. 142), varying with the\r\nperviousness of the soil, but rarely exceeding four or five feet in\r\nthe humid regions; though doubtless found at greater depths in the\r\narid climates. It is also obvious that the use of any antiseptic or\r\npoisonous materials on the field or in the manure pile will tend to\r\ndisturb and restrain the useful activity of these organisms.\r\n\r\n_Putrefactive Processes._—Carbonic gas is formed also, but to a much\r\nmore limited extent, in _putrefactive processes_, occurring in the\r\nabsence, or with only limited access, of air or oxygen. These processes\r\nlikewise are conditioned upon the presence or activity of (largely\r\nanerobic) bacteria; but they should not occur in normally constituted,\r\nand especially in tilled soils, being as a rule inimical to the growth\r\nof cultivated plants (see chap. 9, p. 145).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nTHE COLORS OF SOILS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe natural coloration of soils forms a prominent part of the\r\ncharacters upon which farmers are wont to base their judgment of\r\nland quality; hence the origin and value of soil-colors deserve\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n_Black Soils._—From the oldest times down to the present a “rich, black\r\nsoil” has commanded attention and approval. The black and brown-black\r\ncolors being almost invariably due to the presence of much humus (very\r\nrarely to an admixture of carbon [graphite], of magnetic oxid of iron,\r\nor sesquioxid of manganese), it is obvious that the farmers’ judgment\r\ncoincides with a high estimate of the agricultural value of humus.\r\nA discussion of this point will be found in another place; but the\r\npopular judgment is based quite as much upon the experience had in the\r\nadvantages that usually accompany the presence of humus. It largely\r\ncharacterizes low grounds, and therefore alluvial lands, whose richness\r\nis due to far more general causes. But the _shade_ of the blackness\r\nseen in the soil deserves and usually receives close consideration.\r\nIf tending toward brown, acid humus or “sour” land is indicated;\r\nunless indeed the surface soil should be bodily derived from decayed\r\nwood, as in the primeval forests. Forest soils in general are usually\r\ndark-tinted for some inches near the surface, owing to the presence of\r\nleaf mold, and mostly have an acid reaction.\r\n\r\nBut the black tint is equally welcome to the land-seeker when seen\r\noutside of alluvial and forest areas. Belts of “black lands” appear\r\non hillsides and plateaus; and these lands, though clearly not\r\nalluvial, are also found to be preëminently productive; witness the\r\nupland prairies of the western and southern United States. These black\r\nsoils are always characterized by the presence of a full supply of\r\nlime in the form of carbonate, under the influence of which the most\r\ndeeply black humus is formed. In other words, the jet black tint is\r\nindicative of calcareous lands; and these, as will be more fully shown\r\nbelow, are almost always highly productive.\r\n\r\nFrom both points of view, then, the favorable judgment passed upon\r\nblack soils by practical men is justified.\r\n\r\nBut it is not necessarily true that soils showing no obvious black tint\r\nare poor in humus; for in strongly ferruginous or “red” soils its tint\r\nis frequently wholly obscured, though when still visible it gives rise\r\nto the laudatory name of “mahogany land,” which every farmer considers\r\na prize.\r\n\r\nOf course then it would be wholly incorrect to judge of the\r\nagricultural value of land from its humus-content alone; for its color\r\nmay be entirely imperceptible and yet its amount and nitrogen content\r\nbe fully adequate to the requirements of thrifty vegetation. Gray and\r\neven whitish soils very frequently fall within this category in the\r\narid region.\r\n\r\nThe black tint is also favorable to the absorption of the sun’s heat,\r\nand is therefore conducive to earlier maturity than is to be looked for\r\nin light-tinted lands similarly located.\r\n\r\nWollny (Forsch. Agr. Phys. Vol. 12, 1889, p. 385), discusses the\r\ninfluence of color on soils in relation to moisture and content of\r\ncarbonic acid. The results show in general simply the effects due\r\nto increase of temperature when the soils are either darker-colored\r\nthroughout, or made so superficially.\r\n\r\n_“Red” Soils._—Next to a black soil, a “red” one will usually command\r\nthe instinctive approval of farmers. The cause of this preference is\r\nnot as obvious as in the case of the black tints; but the general\r\nconsensus of opinion requires an examination of its claims. It is of\r\ncourse easy enough to adduce examples of very poor “red” soils, derived\r\nfrom ferruginous sandstones that supply little else than quartz and\r\nferric hydrate; the Cotton States supply cogent examples in point, as\r\ndo also the lower Foothills of the Sierra Nevada of California. It is\r\nnot, therefore, the iron rust or ferric hydrate that renders the land\r\nproductive; but its presence is a sign of some favorable conditions.\r\nFirst among these is, that ferric hydrate cannot continue to exist in\r\nbadly drained soils; a “red” soil is therefore a well-drained one, and\r\nthis is probably one of the chief causes of the popular preference. The\r\n“white land” sometimes seem in tracts otherwise colored with iron, is\r\ndistinctly inferior in production to the red lands; and examination\r\nwill generally show that from some cause, such white lands have been\r\nsubjected to the watery maceration which proves so injurious (see chap.\r\n3, p. 46, chap. 12, p. 231).\r\n\r\nThat finely-diffused ferric hydrate has a very high power of absorbing\r\nmoisture as well as other gases of the atmosphere, has been shown in\r\nthe preceding chapter; it stands in this respect next to humus itself,\r\nand hence highly ferruginous soils need not contain as much humus as\r\n“white” soils from this point of view. Like humus, also, it renders\r\nheavy clay soils more easily tillable.\r\n\r\n_Origin of Red Tints._—Where crystalline rocks prevail, the red tint\r\nusually indicates the derivation from the weathering of hornblende;\r\nimplying also, outside of the tropics, the presence of sufficient lime\r\nin the land. Such lands are naturally preferred to those of lighter\r\ntints derived from purely feldspathic rocks (see chap. 3, p. 32),\r\nalthough they may be poorer in potash than the latter.\r\n\r\nBut the red tint has also its intrinsic advantages in the more ready\r\nabsorption of the sun’s heat by the colored than by a white surface.\r\nThis is probably the chief cause of the higher quality of wines\r\ngrown on red hillsides in the middle and northern vine districts of\r\nEurope, where everything that aids earlier maturity is of the greatest\r\nimportance. The function of ferric oxid as a carrier of oxygen (chap.\r\n4, p. 45) probably also aids nitrification.\r\n\r\n“Yellow” lands owe their tint, of course, to smaller amounts of ferric\r\nhydrate, but share more or less in the advantages of the “red.”\r\n\r\n_White_ soils, or more properly those having very light gray tints, are\r\nnot usually looked upon with favor, especially in the humid region. The\r\ncauses of the unfavorable judgment current among farmers in respect to\r\nwhite soils has already been partially explained in the discussion of\r\nthe black and red tints. The light color means the scarcity or absence\r\nof both humus and ferric hydrate, and usually implies that the soil has\r\nbeen subject to reductive maceration through the influence of stagnant\r\nwater; reducing the ferric hydrate to ferrous salts, oxidizing away\r\nthe humus, and accumulating in the form of inert concretions most or\r\nall of the lime, iron and phosphoric acid of the soil mass (see chap.\r\n3, p. 46, chap. 10, p. 184). The term “crawfishy,” so commonly applied\r\nto white soils in the eastern United States, expresses well the usual\r\ncondition of the white soils of that region; which are very commonly\r\ninhabited by crayfish, whose holes reach water a few feet below ground,\r\nand are surrounded on the outside by piles of white subsoil mixed\r\nwith “black gravel” or concretions of bog iron ore. It is needless\r\nto say why such lands cannot command the favorable consideration of\r\nthe farmer; they cannot as a rule be cultivated without previous\r\ndrainage, and even after that will usually prove unthrifty, “raw,” and\r\nin immediate need of fertilization by green-manuring, and the use of\r\nphosphates.\r\n\r\nIn the arid region, lands of this character are of rare occurrence,\r\nwhile (as has been explained above, chap. 8, p. 135), the light gray\r\nor “white” tints are there a very common characteristic of even the\r\nvery best soils. It is true that they are poor in humus and in finely\r\ndiffused ferric hydrate; but their “light” texture renders the presence\r\nof humus for this purpose less needful, and as stated elsewhere (see\r\nchap. 8, p. 135), the high nitrogen-content of arid humus renders\r\na smaller supply adequate for vegetative purposes. As to iron, its\r\npresence being more important as a sign of good drainage and aeration\r\nthan directly, its absence from soils of great depth and loose texture\r\nis of no consequence; especially when the heat-absorption which it\r\nfavors is not only not needed, but is usually already in undesirable\r\nexcess during the hot summers.\r\n\r\n_White Alkali Spots._—In the valleys of the arid region, however,\r\n_very_ white spots commonly indicate the prevalence of alkali salts,\r\nand to that extent are an unfavorable indication; especially when\r\ncoupled with the occurrence of black rings or spots, which indicate the\r\npresence of black alkali or carbonate of soda (see chap. 22).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nCLIMATE.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Heat and Moisture_ are the main governing conditions of plant growth.\r\nIn a preceding chapter the relations of soils and plant growth to\r\nwater have been considered; in the present one the relations of both\r\nmoisture and heat to soils and plants will be discussed; and to do\r\nthis intelligibly to those not making a specialty of such studies, it\r\nbecomes necessary to introduce, first, a summary consideration of the\r\nsubject of climate.\r\n\r\nClimatic conditions control, and to a great extent determine, the\r\nindustrial pursuits of every country; all the more so as the rapid\r\ncommunication and transportation by means of modern appliances now\r\nbrings every part of the globe in competition with every other. The\r\nquestion is not now what it may be intrinsically possible to do under\r\ncertain climatic and geographical conditions, but whether these things\r\ncan be done with a reasonable prospect of profit and commercial\r\nsuccess, in competition with other countries offering more or less\r\nof similar possibilities. While it is true that the cost of labor\r\nfrequently enters most heavily into such problems, yet favorable or\r\nunfavorable climatic or soil-conditions may in many cases turn the\r\nscale. Thus the high price of labor and fuel on the Pacific coast of\r\nthe United States would at first blush seem to render competition\r\nwith Europe and the East in the production of beet sugar commercially\r\nimpossible; yet exceptionally favorable climatic and soil-conditions\r\nconcur to turn the scale in favor of California at least, so as to have\r\nplaced that state at the head of the sugar-producing states of the\r\nUnion. A general understanding of the climatic conditions which concern\r\nthe United States more or less directly, is therefore needful to an\r\nappreciation of their agricultural possibilities.\r\n\r\n_Climatic Conditions._—The factors usually mentioned as constituting\r\nclimate are temperature, rainfall and winds. Since the latter\r\ntwo factors, however, are themselves merely the result of _heat_\r\nconditions, it is proper to discuss from the outset the origin and mode\r\nof action of heat.\r\n\r\n\r\nTEMPERATURE.\r\n\r\nThe temperature of stellar space outside of the atmosphere is\r\nknown to be very low. The increasing cold as we ascend to greater\r\nheights, is a fact familiar to all. Langley has calculated upon the\r\nbasis of observations made at the summit and foot of Mount Whitney\r\nin California, that the temperature of space lies near 200° Cent.\r\n(360° F.) below the freezing point of water; and this would be the\r\ntemperature near the Earth’s surface, were it not for the surrounding\r\natmosphere. The latter absorbs but a small amount of the sun’s direct\r\nheat rays (which are of _high_ intensity), as they penetrate it to the\r\nEarth’s surface. But as the earth’s surface is warmed, the heat rays of\r\n_low_ intensity which it emits cannot pass back through the atmosphere\r\nto the sun or to outer space; they are “trapped,” as it were, by the\r\ndense air resting near the earth’s surface, which is then warmed partly\r\nby the radiation from, partly by direct contact with, the soil. It is\r\nto the existence of our atmosphere, then, that the possibility of our\r\nanimal and vegetable life in their present form is due; and a decrease\r\nof the trapping effect on the sun’s heat rays makes itself quickly felt\r\nwhen ascending, either in balloons or on high mountains. Moreover, it\r\nis well known to mountain climbers that at great elevations the sun’s\r\nheat is extremely intense at noon; even though the temperature may fall\r\nto the freezing point at night, owing to the failure of the thin air\r\nto prevent the radiation back into space of the heat absorbed during\r\nthe day. On the high plateaus of the Andes and of Asia, therefore, very\r\nextreme climates prevail, on account of the great range of temperature\r\nbetween day and night.\r\n\r\n_Ascertainment and Presentation of Temperature-Conditions._—The proper\r\nunderstanding of the temperature conditions of any locality or region\r\nis by no means a simple matter. Shall we study the daily, monthly, or\r\nannual changes of temperature, or the means deduced from either or all\r\nof them, in order to gain a clear insight into the climatic conditions\r\nthat control crop production and health conditions?\r\n\r\n_The Annual Mean Temperature not a Good Criterion._—Since one and\r\nthe same figure may result equally from the averaging of two widely\r\ndivergent data, and from such as are close together, it is clear that\r\nthe mean _annual_ temperature cannot be a proper criterion of the\r\nagricultural adaptations of a country. Thus an average temperature of\r\n60° F. might result, equally, from the averaging of 65 and 55 degrees,\r\nor from taking the mean of 15 and 105 degrees; yet the respective\r\ncultural adaptations would be widely different.\r\n\r\n_Extremes of Temperature are Most Important._—It is, on the contrary,\r\nrather the _extremes_ of temperature, more particularly of cold,\r\nbut frequently also of heat, together with the total amount of\r\nheat available during the growing season, that determines such\r\nadaptation so far as temperature is concerned; for no culture plant\r\ncan be successfully grown where the temperature during winter even\r\noccasionally falls for more than a few hours below the point which\r\nit can resist; and for each plant there is a certain aggregate\r\nrequirement of heat to carry it from germination to fruiting. Even\r\ndifferent varieties of one and the same plant differ materially in the\r\nlatter respect, so that it is very important that in the selection of\r\nvarieties to be grown, this factor should be taken into consideration.\r\nIt cannot be too strongly urged that the comparison of annual means of\r\ntemperature, so commonly made by promoters of colonization schemes,\r\nmust not be taken as a guide either in the estimate of cultures in\r\nwhich the immigrant may desire to engage, or by those in search of a\r\nclimate adapted to their health-conditions.\r\n\r\n_Seasonal and Monthly Means._—The statement of the mean temperatures of\r\nthe conventional four seasons—spring, summer, autumn and winter—afford\r\na much clearer conception of climatic adaptations; provided always\r\nthat the extreme temperatures be considered at the same time. With the\r\nsame understanding, the monthly means are still more instructive; but\r\nhere again, it is most essential that the distribution and amount of\r\nrainfall in each be regarded at the same time, since the most desirable\r\ntemperature is of no avail without the moisture required for vegetation.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, _e. g._, that of California, it becomes necessary\r\nfor practical purposes to regard the “season,” and not the calendar\r\nyear, as the unit or reference for crop production. There the crops\r\ndepend upon what rainfall may occur from October to May, there being\r\nno summer rains of agricultural significance, and outside of irrigated\r\nlands, almost all vegetation save that of trees being in abeyance. In\r\nIndia, there are two distinct growing seasons (“kharif” and “rabi”),\r\ncorresponding to the two “monsoon” seasons; and no matter how much rain\r\nmay fall during _one_, almost total failure may occur in other tropical\r\nand arid sections of that country.\r\n\r\nThe _Daily Variations_ are of interest chiefly with respect to health\r\nconditions, since most plants are more adaptable in this respect than\r\nthe average man.\r\n\r\n\r\nRAINFALL.\r\n\r\n_Distribution Most Important._—The summary statements of the annual\r\nrainfall are almost equally as deceptive as are those of annual mean\r\ntemperature, since quite as much depends on the manner in which it\r\nis distributed through the year, as upon its absolute amount; and\r\nalso upon the manner of its fall. Thus Central Montana has the same\r\naggregate annual rainfall as the country surrounding the Bay of San\r\nFrancisco, viz. about 24 inches; but while in the Franciscan climate\r\nthis amount of rain falls during one-half of the year, and that the\r\ngrowing season, enabling crops to be grown without irrigation, in\r\nMontana the rainfall is distributed over the entire season, so that\r\nirrigation is absolutely essential for the successful production of\r\ncrops. This so much the more as, while the winter snowfall is very\r\nlight, the rains of summer are largely torrential, running off the\r\nsurface in muddy floods and giving little time for absorption into the\r\nsoil. Farther west, in Washington, where grain crops are largely grown\r\nwithout irrigation, the sowing of winter grain is impracticable because\r\nthe dry summer is immediately followed by the very light snowfall of\r\nwinter, which falls on dry ground. Fall-sown grain would thus simply\r\nlie dormant in the ground through the winter, with great liability\r\nto injury from stress of weather in early spring, apart from the\r\ndepredations of birds and rodents. Hence grain is always sown there in\r\nspring only.\r\n\r\nThese examples may suffice to show that summary statements of either\r\ntemperature or rainfall by yearly means are of little practical\r\ninterest to the farmer. What he needs to know is whether or not\r\nsufficient rains to mature a full crop are likely to fall during the\r\ntime that the growing temperature prevails; and what are the minima and\r\nmaxima of temperature—heat and cold—that his crops will be called upon\r\nto endure.\r\n\r\n\r\nWINDS.\r\n\r\nThe third climatic factor mentioned, the winds, though proverbial for\r\ntheir unreliability and inconstancy, are not only very incisive in\r\ntheir action, but also to a considerable extent of very definite local\r\nor regional occurrence and significance. Moreover, their occurrence,\r\ndirection, temperature and moisture-condition can, in regions whose\r\nclimatology has been reasonably well studied, be foretold with\r\nsufficient accuracy to be of great use to the farmer.\r\n\r\n_Heat the Cause of Winds._—As already stated, the primary cause of\r\nall winds is heat, substantially on the principle according to which\r\ndraught is created in our domestic fires. The hot air rising creates an\r\nindraught from all directions, especially from that which it can most\r\nreadily come; viz., from the ocean,[101] or from level lands, rather\r\nthan across mountain chains. Hence the sea-breeze in the after part\r\nof the day, when the land has become heated; while the sea, requiring\r\na much larger amount of heat to change its temperature to a similar\r\nextent, remains relatively cool. But at night the earth cools more\r\nrapidly than the sea, by radiation; hence toward evening the sea-breeze\r\ndies down, and toward and after sunset the land-breeze takes its place.\r\n\r\n[101] A striking case in point is the regular wind which in summer\r\nblows through the “Golden Gate,” a gap in the Coast Range connecting\r\nthe Pacific Ocean directly with the great interior valley of\r\nCalifornia, along the bays of San Francisco, San Pablo, and Suisun. The\r\ngreat interior valley and adjacent mountain slopes becoming intensely\r\nheated during the rainless summer, the ascending air is replaced by\r\na steady indraught from the sea, which is bordered by a belt of cold\r\nwater causing fogs along the coast. The fogs are quickly dispelled on\r\nreaching the edge of the valley near the middle of its length; whence\r\nsteady breezes blow northward and southward, up the valleys of the\r\nSacramento and San Joaquin respectively. These winds, popularly often,\r\nbut erroneously, called trade-winds, are really “monsoons” similar in\r\ntheir origin to those of India, which, when coming from the sea cause\r\nrains, but when from the heated land itself are hot and dry; as in the\r\ncase of the sirocco of Italy and North Africa, the terral of Spain and\r\nthe northers of California.\r\n\r\nThe principle of this local change of winds, together with the rotation\r\nof the earth, the absorption of moisture by air, and the fact that the\r\nlatter becomes cooler when it expands on rising and warmer when it is\r\ncompressed by descending, serves to explain all the major phenomena\r\nusually observed in connection with winds. The air of the equatorial\r\nbelt, heated throughout the year, necessarily rises and creates an\r\nindraught from both north and south; but since the air thus flowing in\r\nhas a lower rotary velocity than the earth’s surface at the Equator,\r\nit lags behind and so gives rise to northeast and southeast winds,\r\nrespectively, between the two tropics and the equatorial belt. These\r\nregular winds, from the aid they give to commerce in passing from\r\ncontinent to continent, are known as the _trade winds_. On the other\r\nhand, the air that has risen from the hot equatorial belt, cooling by\r\nexpansion as it rises and flowing northward and southward from the\r\nEquator, on descending as it mainly does into the temperate zones, has\r\na higher rotary velocity than the land-surface and so tends to give\r\nrise to southwest and northwest winds in the northern and southern\r\nhemispheres respectively. At sea, on coasts and in level inland regions\r\nto windward of mountain chains, such winds are often quite regular\r\nduring a portion of the year.\r\n\r\n_Cyclones._—But local disturbances arising from heated land areas or\r\nmountain slopes, as well as wide atmospheric changes whose causes are\r\nnot fully understood, give rise to waves of alternating high and low\r\nbarometric pressure, largely converting rectilinear or slightly curved\r\nwind-motion into whirls or “cyclones”[102] ranging from a thousand to\r\nover two thousand miles in diameter. These in the case of low-pressure\r\nwaves or centers, _toward_ which the air flows from the _outside_,\r\nrevolve in the direction contrary to the movement of the hands of a\r\nclock, and commonly produce rain in their east portion. A high-pressure\r\nwave or center, _from_ which the air naturally flows toward the\r\n_outside_, will usually bring about an “anti-cyclone” area with fair,\r\nand in winter cold (“blizzard”) weather, the direction of the whirl\r\nbeing, in this case, the reverse, or in the same direction as the hands\r\nof a clock. Both cyclones and anti-cyclones move in North America from\r\nwest to east, mostly entering from the Pacific Ocean off the northwest\r\ncoast and traversing the continent with a slight southeast (or in the\r\ncase of cold weather almost south) trend, with a velocity of twenty\r\nto thirty miles an hour; until upon reaching the region of the Great\r\nLakes they generally turn northeastward and pass into the Atlantic\r\nOcean from the New England and Canada coasts.—It is upon these general\r\nfacts, roughly outlined here, that the weather forecasts are in the\r\nmain based; taking into consideration, of course, the local or regional\r\nconditions, topography, etc., which modify the application of the\r\ngeneral rules.\r\n\r\n[102] This designation is popularly and incorrectly applied to the\r\ncomparatively limited, but very violent and destructive rotary storms\r\nor whirlwinds which originate locally on the heated plains of the\r\nMiddle West of the United States, and are almost always accompanied\r\nby violent electric phenomena. These should properly be called\r\n_tornadoes_. At sea such whirlwinds give rise to waterspouts, in\r\ndeserts to sand storms.\r\n\r\nIn the southern hemisphere, the air-movements substantially correspond\r\nto those observed in the northern, so far as not modified by mountain\r\nchains; as is especially the case in South America.\r\n\r\n\r\nINFLUENCE OF TOPOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\n_Rains to Windward of Mountain Chains._—The surface features or\r\ntopography of the regions traversed by the air currents or winds may\r\nmaterially modify both their direction and their physical condition,\r\nespecially as to moisture and temperature. Mountain chains may deflect\r\nthem, or, causing the air currents to rise on their slopes, and thus to\r\ncool by expansion, the moisture these bring with them from the sea may\r\nbe partially, or sometimes almost wholly, deposited in the form of rain\r\nor snow; chiefly on the windward slopes. Then, continuing across the\r\nrange, the air deprived of most of its moisture cannot readily yield\r\nup more; hence the scarcity of rain—“arid climate”—under the lee of\r\nmountain chains; as in the Great Basin between the Sierra Nevada and\r\nCascade ranges on the one hand and the Rocky Mountains on the other,\r\nand also on the Great Plains under the lee of the latter. The abundant\r\nrainfall between the Mississippi river and the Atlantic coast is due to\r\nthe moist winds coming from the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico and\r\nCaribbean sea, whose access is not interfered with by any cross-ranges\r\nof mountains. But the Great Plains lying between the Mississippi and\r\nthe Rocky Mountains are not within the sweep of the Gulf winds, whose\r\ntrend is SW to NE; while they are equally out of reach of moisture\r\nfrom the Pacific, all that having been successively deposited on the\r\nintervening mountains; hence their deficient rainfall.\r\n\r\nNorthward of the temperate zone the rainfall generally decreases as we\r\napproach the arctic regions; except where the influence of warm ocean\r\ncurrents to windward creates comparatively local exceptions, as in the\r\ncase of Norway and Alaska.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 52.—Composite Curve showing distribution of\r\nRainfall in Europe, Africa and America projected on 100 Meridian W. L.]\r\n\r\n_The general Distribution of Rainfall_ on the globe is well shown in\r\nthe annexed diagram, which is copied by permission of the author from\r\nhis treatise on the “Evolution of Climates,”[103] and represents the\r\nmean deduced from data given in the Atlas of Meteorology by J. G.\r\nBartholomew. It is a composite curve derived from the consolidation\r\nof four curves showing the distribution of rainfall, viz., on the\r\nmeridians of 20°E.L.; the west coasts of Europe and Africa; the 30th\r\nmeridian W.L., in the Atlantic Ocean; and the west coasts of North\r\nand South America, projected on the plane of the 100th meridian W.L.\r\nThe latter curve corresponds with remarkable closeness to the mean\r\ncurve here given. “It is not intended that these curves should include\r\nthe rainfall upon meridians on which the distribution in belts is\r\ninterrupted by continental influences, and by the irregular oblique\r\nbelts of rain on the east coasts.” But it presents an admirable\r\ngeneralization upon which, as a basis, the local disturbances may be\r\nstudied.\r\n\r\n[103] “The Evolution of Climates”; by Marsden Manson, July, 1903; also\r\n_Amer. Geologist_, Aug.-Oct. 1897.\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that the maximum of rainfall in the tropical rain-belt\r\nlies several degrees to northward of the equator, owing doubtless to\r\nthe greater land area in the northern hemisphere. There is thus, on the\r\nwhole, a narrower belt of deficient rainfall or aridity between the\r\ntropical and _northern_ temperate rain-belts, than in the _southern_\r\nhemisphere. The southern temperate rain-belt touches only the extreme\r\nends of South America, Africa and New Zealand; elsewhere on the ocean\r\nit has not been sufficiently observed as yet. The zones of rainfall and\r\naridity are, however, known to be subject to seasonal oscillations of\r\nseveral degrees in latitude, owing to the obliquity of the plane of the\r\necliptic, which shifts its position upon that of the equator.\r\n\r\n_Ocean Currents._—Since water as a fluid is subject to the same\r\ncirculatory motions which cause winds, it is to be expected that\r\nocean currents should exist corresponding to those of the air, as\r\ncharacterized in general above. But as water warms so much more slowly\r\nthan air, its circulation would be comparatively insensible were it\r\nnot for the effects produced by the air currents upon the surface of\r\nthe sea, combined, as in the case of the winds, with the effects of\r\nthe rotation of the earth. Without going into the details of the ocean\r\ncurrents in the tropics, it may suffice to say that owing partly to the\r\nmoving and warming effects of winds, partly to the natural circulatory\r\nmotion of the water, two great warm currents flow from the tropics\r\nnorthward, materially modifying what would otherwise be the climates of\r\nthe coasts they touch.\r\n\r\n_The Gulf Stream._—The current most generally known is the Gulf Stream,\r\nflowing partly from the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea, partly\r\nfrom outside of the same along the chain of the Lesser Antilles, along\r\nthe southeast coast of the United States (Florida, Georgia and South\r\nCarolina); but owing to its greater rotational velocity it is soon,\r\nlike the winds of the same latitudes, deflected from a northward to a\r\nNE. course, which carries it away from the American coast, to impart\r\nsome of its warmth, (probably mainly through the winds that blow over\r\nit), to Great Britain and Ireland, Scandinavia, and Western Europe\r\ngenerally; while the northern American coast is left to be bathed by\r\nthe icy polar current flowing from the Arctic through Baffin’s Bay,\r\nwhich carries icebergs far to the south in the way of the transatlantic\r\ntraffic between the Eastern States and Europe, and causes a difference\r\nin climate that is well exemplified in the comparison of the climate\r\nof New York with that of Naples, both lying in the same latitude; and\r\nsimilarly of the bleak coast of Labrador with that of Great Britain.\r\n\r\n_The Japan Stream._—On the eastern Asiatic Coast, a warm current\r\noriginating in the Sunda seas, flows off the coasts of the Philippines\r\nand of China and bathes the Japanese islands; hence it is known as\r\nthe Japanese Current, or Kuro-siro. It is partly this current which,\r\nfailing to pass into the Arctic through the shallow waters of Behring\r\nstrait, renders the coast climates of the northwest coast of America\r\nso much milder and moister than is that in corresponding latitudes on\r\nthe east coasts of both continents. Alaska corresponds to Norway in\r\nits moist, foggy and relatively mild coast climate; British Columbia,\r\nWashington and Oregon participate in the benefits of the tempering\r\ninfluence of the return current of the Kuro-siro. But as this return\r\n(“Alaska”) current passes southward into the warmer seas off the\r\nCalifornia coast, its influence is reversed; it becomes a cold current\r\nin the warm waters of the Pacific, and the warm, moist air of the ocean\r\nbeing carried by the westerly winds across this cold stream which flows\r\nalong the shore of California, in summer dense fogs are formed, which\r\nrender navigation difficult and produce a coast climate whose average\r\nsummer and winter temperatures (_e. g._ at San Francisco) may differ\r\nby only a few degrees, viz., 15.5 and 13.0° C. (60 and 56° F.); so\r\nthat a change of clothing from season to season is hardly called for.\r\nThe Alaska Current leaves the immediate coast of California off Pt.\r\nConception near Santa Barbara, gradually losing itself southwestward,\r\nbut still tempering the tropical heat in the Hawaiian Islands. Hence\r\nthe coast climate is much warmer and less foggy in southern California;\r\nbut throughout the State in the interior valleys, screened from the\r\ncoast winds by the Coast ranges, the temperature in summer may rise\r\nseveral degrees above 100° F. for days together; although, owing to the\r\ndryness of the air, the heat is not oppressive.\r\n\r\n_Contrasting Climates in N. W. America._—An even more striking\r\ncontrast, showing the effects of the warm ocean and air currents, when\r\nintercepted by mountain chains, exists on the Pacific coast farther\r\nnorthward, as already mentioned. In Oregon and Washington first the\r\nlow Coast ranges, and then the higher Cascade mountains, obstruct\r\nthe eastward progress of the westerly ocean winds. The result is a\r\nvery heavy rainfall to coastward of and within the Coast ranges, and\r\nan almost equally heavy precipitation on the western slope of the\r\nCascades. Standing on the crest of the latter in summer, one may see to\r\nwestward a rolling sea of clouds, causing almost daily rains; while to\r\neastward the eye ranges over brown or whitish, dusty plains or rolling\r\nlands, almost destitute of tree growth and quivering with heat, under a\r\ndeep blue sky untroubled by clouds for months.\r\n\r\nA somewhat similar contrast is seen in the Hawaiian islands, which are\r\nin the sweep of the subtropical northeast trade winds, and on their\r\nwindward (eastern) slopes have abundant rains; while on the leeward\r\nslopes an almost arid climate prevails, calling for extended irrigation.\r\n\r\n_Continental, Coast and Insular Climates._—From what has been said\r\nabove, the striking differences of climate caused by the position of\r\nany region with reference to the sea or other large bodies of water\r\non the one hand, and to mountain chains on the other, can be readily\r\nunderstood; provided of course that the direction of the winds and the\r\ntrend of the mountain chains be properly taken into consideration.\r\nWestern coasts in the temperate and subtropical regions will have a\r\nrelatively even, temperate and moist climate as compared with the\r\ninterior of continents, from which the tempering influence of the\r\nsea is cut off by mountain chains. Where no such chains intervene\r\nthe coast climate may extend far inland. The latter case is that of\r\nEurope, where the prevailing westerly winds, warmed by the Gulf Stream,\r\ntemper the climate as far east as the borders of Russia, and northward\r\nto Norway; while to southward the warm waters of the Mediterranean and\r\nBlack seas temper both heat and cold in Spain, southern France, Italy\r\nand the Mediterranean border generally. But to eastward, in Russia and\r\nSiberia, the climate becomes “continental” to an extreme degree, with\r\nvery cold winters and very hot summers. The same is true of interior\r\nNorth America, wherever the continental divide cuts off the tempering\r\ninfluence of the westerly winds; Montana, the Dakotas and the Great\r\nPlains states generally being examples. The climate of the Mississippi\r\nvalley, as stated before, is tempered by the winds blowing from the\r\nGulf of Mexico, but with occasional irruptions of the continental\r\nclimate (sometimes reaching as far east as the South Atlantic coast)\r\nin the forms of cold “blizzards,” from which the coast climates of\r\nthe Pacific and of western Europe are practically free. The Atlantic\r\ncoast of North America (including the coast of the Gulf of Mexico),\r\nmoreover, not unfrequently suffers from the violent cyclonic storms\r\nthat originate in the Antilles and follow more or less the direction of\r\nthe Gulf Stream.\r\n\r\nIslands, differing from continents mainly in their extent, and having\r\na relatively large proportion of coast, naturally have climates\r\ncontrolled essentially by the surrounding ocean. The insular or oceanic\r\nclimates are therefore, as a rule, more temperate and even than are\r\nthose of the nearest mainland. It is often said that the climate of\r\nwestern Europe is “insular”; and owing to its position under the lee of\r\nthe Gulf Stream, this is eminently true of Great Britain.\r\n\r\n_Subtropic Arid Belts._—Where the surface features of the land in\r\nrelation to the ocean and prevailing winds do not interpose special\r\nobstacles, we find to poleward of both tropics a climatic belt of\r\ngreater or less width, in which the annual, or at least the summer\r\nrainfall is too small to maintain annual herbaceous vegetation\r\nthroughout the season, even when the temperature is favorable. These\r\ntwo “arid” belts are best defined in Africa, where the northern one is\r\nrepresented by the Sahara desert, lower Egypt and Arabia, while the\r\nsouthern one is exemplified in the Kalahari desert, to northward of\r\nthe Cape of Good Hope. The northern belt is continued into Asia Minor,\r\nPalestine, Syria and Persia, and is again manifest in northwestern\r\nIndia; but to eastward is stopped by the influence of the great\r\nHimalaya range. The plateau countries beyond, in Central Asia, are\r\nextremely arid, largely by reason of their high elevation.\r\n\r\nIn Australia the southern arid belt is very strongly defined. In North\r\nAmerica, the arid belt is characteristically defined on the Pacific\r\nCoast. It embraces all but the southernmost point of the peninsula of\r\nLower California, with about two-thirds of the State of California;\r\nthence eastward across Sonora and Arizona to New Mexico and western\r\nTexas. But here the influence of the mountain ranges and high plateaus\r\nobscures the subtropical belt as such, the arid climate continuing,\r\neast of the great Pacific ranges, through Nevada, Utah, Wyoming,\r\nMontana, Idaho, and eastern Oregon and Washington nearly to the line of\r\nBritish Columbia on the north, and with gradually decreasing aridity,\r\ninto Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, and the Dakotas.\r\n\r\nIn South America the rainless seaward slopes of southern Peru and\r\nnorthern Chile indicate the southern arid belt; but here, the great\r\nchain of the Andes intervening, the dry pampas of Argentina, and the\r\nGran Chaco of southwestern Brazil, like the Nevada basin, though arid\r\nwould naturally be referred to the moisture-condensing influence of\r\nthe Andes chain, under the lee of which they lie. From this cause\r\nthe region of deficient rainfall, which on the western coast ends to\r\nnorthward of Santiago de Chile, is east of the Andes continued much\r\nfarther poleward, as in North America; reaching into Patagonia.\r\n\r\n_Utilization of the Arid Belts._—While, as already explained, the\r\ndistribution of the rainfall through the year is nearly as important\r\nas its total amount, yet it is evident that even with the minimum\r\nof twenty inches of total precipitation as the measure for crop\r\nproduction, a very large proportion of the land of the arid region\r\ncannot, even with the most elaborate system of water conservation,\r\nbe supplied with sufficient water for ordinary crops, and must be\r\notherwise utilized, mainly for pasture purposes. This is rendered\r\npracticable to a much greater extent than might be expected, because\r\nthe rapid transition from the rainy to the permanent dry season cures\r\nthe standing herbage into hay, which affords good grazing during the\r\nrainless season. Moreover, the use of drought-resistant, browsing\r\nforage plants, both shrubs and trees, serves to supplement materially\r\nany deficiency in the supply of “standing hay,” especially in case the\r\nrains should toward the end be unduly delayed. The same is true of\r\nthe dried pods and seeds of native herbage, which in some cases (bur\r\nclover, lupins, etc.,) afford highly nutritious additions to the leafy\r\nforage.[104]\r\n\r\n[104] See Rept. of the U.

The temperature\r\nmost favorable to germination or growth, as well as the degree of\r\ntolerance of high and low temperatures, varies greatly with different\r\nplants, governing mainly what is known as their climatic adaptation.\r\nA knowledge of these points with reference to the several crops is\r\ntherefore of no mean importance to the farmer; for, to a certain\r\nextent, he can control the temperature in the soil itself, and he can\r\nmostly choose for sowing and planting, the time when the soil shall\r\nhave the proper temperature for rapid germination or maturity. As a\r\nrule, it is not desirable to have either seeds or seedling plants in\r\nthe ground for any length of time when the temperature is too low for\r\nactive vegetation; for while they rest, other, lower organisms (fungi\r\nand bacteria), adapted to low temperatures, may continue in full\r\nactivity at the expense of the vitality of the crop plant.\r\n\r\n_Water exerts controlling Influence._—Since the capacity of water for\r\nheat is approximately five times greater than that of the average\r\nsoil, equal weights being considered, it follows that the temperature\r\nof soil-water must exert a controlling influence over that of the\r\nsoil. Taking the case of a cubic foot of loamy soil, fully saturated\r\nwith water, in which one-third of the volume may be assumed to be\r\nwater: the weight of the dry soil being about eighty pounds per cubic\r\nfoot, calculation shows that the amount of heat required to raise the\r\ntemperature of the water contained, one degree, will be fully twice\r\nas great as for that required for the soil itself. It is thus obvious\r\nthat the control of soil-temperature is largely dependent upon the\r\ncontrol of the water-content of the same, which has been discussed in\r\na former chapter. Even in the condition of moisture known to be most\r\nfavorable to plants, viz., one-half of the maximum water capacity, the\r\ninfluence of the water-content upon the temperature will still be as\r\ngreat as that of the entire soil mass. This consideration emphasizes\r\nthe importance of such control.\r\n\r\n_Cold and Warm Rains._—It is not surprising then that the occurrence\r\nof cold or warm rains or the use of cold or warm irrigation water at\r\ncritical periods, may largely determine the success or failure of\r\nthe crop. It is well known that the occurrence of a cold rain after\r\nvegetation has started actively in early spring, may not only destroy\r\nthe season’s fruit crop by preventing the setting, or thereafter\r\ncausing the dropping, of the fruit, but may even, if the suppression\r\nof vegetative action be continued for some length of time, result\r\nin serious injury to, or death of trees. Widely extended disastrous\r\nexperience of the kind was had in California in February and March,\r\n1887, resulting in the death of tens of thousands of fruit trees and\r\nvines during that and the following season. It is obvious that in\r\nsuch a case as this the rapid draining-off of the cold water through\r\nunderdrains would have materially mitigated, if not wholly prevented,\r\nsuch injury.\r\n\r\n_Solar Radiation._—Aside, however, from such overwhelming influences\r\nas the above, the soil temperatures are measurably controlled by the\r\nextent to which they receive and absorb the sun’s heat rays, whether\r\ndirectly or through the mediation of the air. The direct effect of the\r\nsun’s rays upon the surface is, upon the whole, the most generally\r\npotent, although warm winds may occasionally exert a very strong\r\ninfluence. The varying influence of the sun’s rays depends primarily\r\nupon the change of seasons, which themselves result from the varying\r\nangles at which the sun’s rays strike the surface; as well as upon the\r\nduration of the day. The greater or less cloudiness or fogginess of the\r\nsky, of course, exerts a decided effect in this connection.\r\n\r\n_The Penetration of the Sun’s Heat into the Soil._—In the temperate\r\nregions of the earth the daily variations of temperature cease to be\r\nfelt at depths ranging from two to three feet, according to the nature\r\nof the soil material and its more or less compacted condition. The\r\nmonthly variations, of course, reach to greater depths; while the\r\nannual variations do not disappear in the temperate zone, _e. g._, at\r\nParis, Zürich and Brussels, at a less depth than seventy-five feet.\r\nAt these depths of constant temperature we find approximately the\r\nsame temperature as that which we can deduce from the thermometric\r\nobservations as the annual mean. From similar causes the mean annual\r\ntemperature of any place may be approximately deduced from the\r\nobservation of the water of wells and springs derived from moderate\r\ndepths. For below the level of constant annual temperature the latter\r\nbegins to ascend steadily as we progress downward, owing to the\r\ninterior heat of the earth.\r\n\r\n_Change of Temperature with Depth._—The following table of observations\r\nmade at Brussels illustrates the decrease of annual range of\r\ntemperature with depth:\r\n\r\n                    Average       Annual\r\n    At feet:     temperature.     range.\r\n                     (°C.)        (°C.)\r\n      3.25            7.2          10.5\r\n     15.6            13.5           4.5\r\n     30.8            16.4           1.3\r\n     75.0            17.0           0.0\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to compare with this record that of a well sunk by\r\nErmann at Yakutzk, Siberia, where the mean annual temperature is—9.7 C.\r\n(14.6 F.). This temperature was found a few feet below the surface. At\r\n50 feet the temperature was—7.2 C. (19° F.); at 145 feet—5° Cent. (23°\r\nF.) at 350 feet—.9° C. (30.8° F.) showing that the ground was below the\r\ntemperature of freezing water for some distance farther down; so that\r\nthe search for liquid water was abandoned.\r\n\r\nWe thus see that in the Arctic regions, owing to the presence of water\r\nin the form of ice, the melting of which impedes the access of solar\r\nheat, the level of no variation is found at the distance of a few feet\r\nbelow the surface, despite the great variations in temperature between\r\nthe short but hot summer and the extremely cold winter. In the tropics,\r\nalso, the annual temperature-variation disappears at a less depth than\r\n2 feet, in consequence of the very slight difference between the two\r\nseasonal extremes of temperature.\r\n\r\n_Surface—Conditions that influence Soil-Temperature._ Among these,\r\n_color_ has already been mentioned, and to a certain extent discussed.\r\nWhile it is true that, broadly speaking, dark-colored soils absorb more\r\nof the sun’s heat than light-colored ones, other things being equal, it\r\nmust still be understood, that the nature of the color-giving substance\r\nexerts a very material influence upon the amount of heat absorbed. Thus\r\ncharcoal is among all known substances the one absorbing and radiating\r\nthe sun’s heat rays most powerfully, and all kinds alike; so much so,\r\nthat its absorbent power is taken as 100. But other substances which\r\nto the eye appear equally black, have by no means the same absorbing\r\npower. The heat absorption by black humus is high, though not quite\r\nequal to that of charcoal; and many gray soils, though appearing to\r\nthe eye of rather light tint, really absorb more heat than others\r\nwhich, to our perception, have the darker tint, but are colored by\r\nother substances. Gardeners and especially vine growers in the colder\r\nportions of Europe often take advantage of the powerful absorbing power\r\nof carbon by spreading charcoal or black slate powder over the surface\r\nof the soil where early maturity is specially desired; and slate powder\r\nis similarly used by the peasants at Chamouni to hasten the melting of\r\nthe snow.\r\n\r\n_Heat of High and Low Intensity._—It must also be kept in view that\r\nthe surfaces, and especially the colors that favor absorption of the\r\nintense rays of the sun, may comport themselves quite differently\r\ntoward heat rays of low intensity, such as those thrown back from the\r\nsoil at night when it cools. Were this otherwise, a soil that absorbs\r\nmuch heat in the daytime would lose it with corresponding rapidity at\r\nnight. But this is true only of charcoal; in the case of most other\r\nsubstances, there is a material difference in favor of the retention of\r\nthe heat, of low intensity, by slower radiation into a “heat-trapping”\r\natmosphere.\r\n\r\n_Reflection vs. Dispersion of Heat._—Theoretically, a smooth surface\r\nreflects more heat than a rough one, and warms much more slowly by\r\nabsorption; as is strikingly shown by the use of polished metal screens\r\nplaced on walls to prevent their being overheated by a flue near by.\r\nIn the case of soils, also, the condition of the surface affects\r\nmaterially the absorption of heat, but not in accordance with the\r\nabove rule so far as the result is concerned. For it is found that,\r\nother things being equal, a loose or cloddy surface disperses in many\r\ndirections the heat it receives, and does not permit it to penetrate\r\nby conduction to so great extent as would a more compact soil, whose\r\nsmooth surface would waste less of the heat received by radiation.\r\n\r\n    King has called special attention to the difference of\r\n    temperature existing between soils smoothed and compacted by\r\n    a roller, and the unrolled soil having a loose surface. He\r\n    found that the former at a depth of one and a half inches\r\n    was as much as 5.5°C. (10°F.) warmer than the loose soil,\r\n    and that even at a depth of three inches a difference as\r\n    high as 3.5°C. (6.5°F.) existed between the two. He observed\r\n    at the same time that the temperature of the air over the\r\n    unrolled ground was considerably warmer than above the\r\n    rolled, thus corroborating the differences observed in the\r\n    soil itself. But at night the heat is given out more rapidly\r\n    from the rolled than from the unrolled surface, the latter\r\n    acting as a non-conductor and keeping the soil warmer than\r\n    that of the more compact rolled land. King gives as the\r\n    average difference observed between rolled and unrolled land\r\n    on eight Wisconsin farms, 1.6°C. (3°F.) in favor of the\r\n    rolled land between 1 and 4 p.m.\r\n\r\nIt will thus be seen that the loose tilled layer, while impeding the\r\npenetration of the sun’s heat into the deeper portions of the soil\r\nduring the day, on the other hand serves to retain it at night better\r\nthan a more compact soil. This obviously places it within the power of\r\nthe farmer to exert considerable control over the soil-temperature at\r\ncritical times; restraining or favoring the access of the sun’s heat in\r\naccordance with the requirements of the climate or season, as the case\r\nmay be.\r\n\r\n_Influence of a Covering of Vegetation, and of Mulches._—A cover of\r\neither living or dead vegetation depresses the temperature of the soil\r\nas compared with the bare land, as elaborately shown by Wollny and\r\nEbermeyer. In the monthly averages these differences rarely exceed\r\n.8° C. (1.5 degrees F.), and are mostly below .50° C. (1° F.), but\r\nduring different parts of the day they may rise to 2.2 to 2.5° C. (4\r\nto 4.5° F.), at 4 inches depth. In summer they are greater than at\r\nother seasons. Of course the density of the vegetation or the thickness\r\nof the mulch influences them materially. Forests exert the greatest\r\ncooling influence upon the soil, and next to these the dense herbaceous\r\ncrops, such as clover, and the legumes generally.\r\n\r\n_Influence of the Nature of the Soil-Material._—Aside from the\r\nsurface condition, the nature of the material itself exerts a certain\r\ninfluence, not only upon the rate of introduction of heat, but also\r\nupon the amount taken up. Thus quartz sand having the highest density\r\n(greatest weight per cubic foot) and also the highest capacity for\r\nheat among the usual mineral soil-ingredients, will, mass for mass,\r\nexperience a smaller rise of temperature than would clay or loam soil,\r\nof less density or volume-weight, and also of lower heat-capacity.\r\nWhile this holds good theoretically, differences corresponding to\r\nthis consideration rarely occur in nature, for the reason that the\r\nmuch greater influence of the mechanical condition of the soil mostly\r\noverbalances these effects. Thus Wollny has shown that while quartz\r\nis a better heat-conductor than clay, quartz cobbles or gravel will\r\nmaterially increase the temperature of the soil in which they are\r\nimbedded. Yet compact clay is a better conductor of heat than loose\r\nsand; hence the latter, when exposed to the intense heat of the summer\r\nsun in the desert, becomes intensely hot on the surface, yet allows of\r\nthe existence of abundant moisture at a depth of ten or twelve inches;\r\nwhile clay in the same region, being usually in a compacted condition,\r\nwill show a lower surface-temperature and will be warmer and drier\r\nat a depth at which sand will still retain abundant moisture, and be\r\ncomparatively cool (See chap. 13, p. 257.) So much indeed depends upon\r\nthe state of mechanical division and flocculation in which the several\r\nsoils may happen to be, that a hard-and-fast statement in regard to\r\ntheir relations to heat cannot and should not be given, as it would\r\nonly lead to disappointments and practical mistakes; the more as in all\r\ncases the moisture-condition exerts an influence predominating by far\r\nover that of the dry material itself, and this moisture-condition is\r\nsubject to rapid changes, owing to intrinsic differences in the several\r\nclasses of soils. Wollny states as the result of his experiments, that\r\nin summer sandy soils are warmest; then humous, lime and loam soils;\r\nwhile in winter humous soils are warmest, then loams; and sand coldest.\r\n\r\n_Influence of Evaporation._—In treating of the Conservation of\r\nSoil Moisture (chapter 13), the effects, conditions and control of\r\nevaporation from the soil have already been discussed from several\r\npoints of view; so that a summary review of the subject must suffice in\r\nthis place.\r\n\r\nIt has been stated above that in the case of an average loam soil\r\nsaturated with water, the heat required to raise the temperature of the\r\nwater one degree would be about twice that needed to so change the dry\r\nsoil material itself. But if it is required to _evaporate_ the same\r\namount of water from the soil, nearly ten (9.667) times that amount of\r\nheat will be required; or in the case assumed, twenty times as much\r\nas would suffice to raise the temperature of the dry soil through an\r\nequal interval of temperature. While in a few cases the cooling of the\r\nsoil by evaporation is desirable, in the vast majority of cases it is\r\ninjurious to the progress of vegetation, and should be restricted as\r\nmuch as possible by the means outlined in a former chapter.\r\n\r\n_Formation of Dew._—There is, however, another aspect of evaporation\r\nfrom the soil which has been long misunderstood, although the true\r\nstate of the case was partially recognized long ago. Dew is in common\r\nparlance said to “fall,” it being supposed that, like rain, it is\r\nderived from the atmosphere. While this is partially true, inasmuch\r\nas from very moist, and notably from foggy air dew is frequently\r\ndeposited on grass and foliage generally, as well as on wood and\r\nother strongly heat-radiating surfaces; yet as a matter of fact, in\r\nby far the majority of cases, as shown by H. E. Stockbridge[105] and\r\nconfirmed by everyday observation, dew is formed from the vapor rising\r\nfrom the warmer soil into a colder atmosphere, and condensed on the\r\nmost strongly heat-radiating surfaces near the ground, such as grass,\r\nleaves both green and dry, wood, and other objects first encountering\r\nthe rising vapor. In manifest proof of this it will be noted that very\r\nheavy dews may be seen on the ground, when the roofs of houses as well\r\nas the higher shrubs and trees remain perfectly dry. In winter this\r\nmay be most strikingly seen in the deposition of hoar-frost in and\r\nimmediately around the cracks of plank sidewalks, whose surface remains\r\ndry.\r\n\r\n[105] “Rocks and Soils,” pp. 175-189.\r\n\r\n_Dew rarely adds Moisture._—Candid observations will convince any one,\r\ntherefore, that in most cases the supposed addition to the moisture of\r\nthe soil from dews is an illusion. Whatever dewdrops fall on the ground\r\nare in general simply the return to the soil of a part of what came\r\nfrom it; while the dew that evaporates from the bedewed leaves or other\r\nobjects represents simply a delayed outgo of moisture from the soil,\r\nwhich for a time retards evaporation direct from the soil, and thus\r\neffects a slight saving of moisture.\r\n\r\n    But while this is measurably true of inland and especially\r\n    of continental areas like the great plains of North and\r\n    South America, it is also true that in deep moist valleys,\r\n    and on the rainy and foggy coast regions of continents,\r\n    dews are found to both fall and rise, not uncommonly to\r\n    such an extent as to be equivalent to a not inconsiderable\r\n    aggregate precipitation. Thus in the moist coast belt of\r\n    Oregon and Washington lying west of the Cascade range of\r\n    mountains, the morning dews of summer are frequently so\r\n    copious that the water falls in showers from the lower trees\r\n    and shrubs, so as to necessitate the use of water-proof\r\n    clothing when traversing the woods in the morning, quite as\r\n    much as though rain was actually falling. In hilly and more\r\n    especially in mountainous regions the cold air descending\r\n    from above and flowing down in the ravines will often cause\r\n    a heavy condensation of dew in these, while the bordering\r\n    ridges, which rise above the cold currents, remain free from\r\n    dew. These descending currents as a rule not only bring no\r\n    surplus moisture with them, but in their downward course\r\n    become warmer by contraction and therefore relatively drier.\r\n    In these cases also, therefore, the dew is purely moisture\r\n    derived from the ground, which in rising encounters the cold\r\n    air and is thus condensed.\r\n\r\nThe fact that dew is most commonly derived from the soil could have\r\nbeen foreseen from the other fact, long ascertained and known, that\r\nduring the night the soil is as a rule warmer than the air above it; as\r\nhas been shown by the earlier observers, as well as more specifically\r\nby Stockbridge.\r\n\r\n_Dew within the Soil._—It is obvious that whenever dew is formed above\r\nthe surface of the soil, the air within the latter must be at or near\r\nits point of saturation with vapor, as in fact is usually the case\r\na few inches below the surface. It follows that when a depression\r\nof temperature occurs within the soil, _e. g._, at night, dew must\r\nbe deposited within the soil down to the depth to which the nightly\r\nvariation reaches, increasing at that depth as the vapor from the\r\nwarmer soil below rises, to be in its turn condensed. There is thus\r\nformed at that level a zone of greater moisture, which may sometimes\r\nbe noted in digging pits, by a deeper tint, without any corresponding\r\nvariation in the nature of the soil. The daily repetition of this\r\nprocess, at varying depths, and its greater or less recurrence at or\r\nnear the limit-levels of monthly and even annual variations, must\r\nexert a not inconsiderable influence upon the vertical distribution\r\nof moisture in the soil; which instead of being usually found in\r\nhorizontal bands or zones of varying moisture-contents, is usually\r\nremarkably uniform for considerable depths, despite the fitfully\r\nrecurrent additions from rains. It is at least probable that this\r\nprocess of dew-formation within the soil materially assists capillarity\r\nin effecting a measurably uniform vertical distribution of moisture.\r\n(See also page 207, chapter 11).\r\n\r\n_Plant-development under different Temperature Conditions._—In the\r\narctic regions the ground, frozen in winter to unknown depths, may\r\nthaw to only three to five feet during the summer, notwithstanding\r\nthe great length and continuous sunshine of the arctic day. The\r\nshallow-rooted arctic flora develops very rapidly under the influence\r\nof the continuous daylight and heat, in the course of from five to\r\neight weeks. The seeds of these plants must, of course, be capable of\r\ngerminating at very low temperatures; and as a matter of fact, we find\r\nthat both in the arctic regions and in the higher mountains, certain\r\nplants are found growing and blooming on slopes flecked with snow; each\r\nplant surrounded by a small circle of bare ground, where the snow has\r\nbeen melted under the influence of the dark-tinted earth and leaves.\r\nIt is clear that here germination has occurred, the foliage has been\r\nformed, and the roots have been exercising their vegetable functions,\r\nin ground soaked with water practically ice-cold.\r\n\r\n_Germination of Seeds._—While wild plants of special adaptation may\r\nthrive in very low (or high) temperatures, it is also true that few of\r\nour cultivated plants will germinate, and still less grow thriftily,\r\nat such low temperatures. The limit below which most cultivated plants\r\nmay be considered as remaining practically inactive lies between\r\n4.4 and 7.2° C. (40 and 45° F.). Few tropical plants will germinate\r\nmuch below 23.8° (75° F.) and in some cases not below 35° Cent. (95°\r\nF.). Even maize and pumpkins, according to Haberlandt, germinate\r\nmost rapidly between 35 and 38.3° C. (95 and 101° F.), while for\r\nwheat, rye, oats and flax the best temperature for germination lies\r\nbetween 21.1 to 26.1 (70 to 79°). Under the most favorable conditions\r\nof temperature and moisture, some small seeds which readily absorb\r\nmoisture will germinate in from twenty-four to forty-eight hours, while\r\nat a lower temperature they may require from three days to two weeks.\r\nThus Haberlandt found that while oats would germinate in two days at\r\na temperature of 17.2 to 17.5° C. (63° to 63.5°), it took a full week\r\nfor germination when the temperature was only 5° C. (41° F.). It is\r\nobvious that seeds remaining inert in the soil for such lengths of time\r\nwill be subject to a variety of vicissitudes that may injure or destroy\r\ntheir vitality. There are many bacteria and fungous parasites which at\r\nlow temperatures are perfectly capable of attacking and destroying the\r\nwater-soaked seed. There is thus for each plant, from the lowest to the\r\nhighest, a certain temperature most favorable to development; and both\r\nabove and below this, the vegetative activity is seriously interfered\r\nwith or wholly checked. A knowledge of these limits is manifestly of\r\nthe utmost practical importance.\r\n\r\n    The influence of too high a temperature in preventing the\r\n    germination of cinchona seed from India, was curiously\r\n    exemplified when it was subjected to a supposedly favorable\r\n    steady temperature of 23.8° C. (75° F.) under otherwise most\r\n    favorable conditions. Not a single one came up in the course\r\n    of six weeks, and the box in which it had been sown was put\r\n    away outside of the hothouse as a failure. Within two weeks\r\n    a full stand of seedlings was obtained, at temperatures\r\n    ranging between 12.7 and 15.5° C. (55° and 60° F.). The fact\r\n    that the cinchona is a tree of the lower slopes of the Andes\r\n    (three to five thousand feet) although at home strictly\r\n    within the tropics, explains the apparent anomaly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART THIRD.\r\n\r\nCHEMISTRY OF SOILS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE PHYSICO-CHEMICAL INVESTIGATION OF SOILS IN RELATION TO CROP\r\nPRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe chemical constituents of soils have been incidentally mentioned\r\nand discussed above, both in connection with the processes of\r\nsoil-formation, and with the minerals that mainly participate therein.\r\nThe manner of their occurrence and their relations to plant life, so\r\nfar as known, must now be considered more in detail.\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORICAL REVIEW OF SOIL INVESTIGATION.\r\n\r\nWhile the obvious importance of the physical soil-conditions has long\r\nago rendered them subjects of close study by Schübler[106] Boussingault\r\nand others, the chemistry of soils was very generally neglected for a\r\nconsiderable period, after the hopes at first entertained by Liebig\r\nthat chemical analysis would furnish a direct indication and measure\r\nof soil fertility, had been sorely disappointed in respect to the only\r\nsoils then investigated, viz., the long-cultivated ones of Europe. The\r\nresults of chemical analysis sometimes agreed, but as often pointedly\r\ndisagreed, with cultural experiences; so that after the middle of the\r\nnineteenth century, but few thought it worth while to occupy their time\r\nin chemical soil analysis.\r\n\r\n[106] The early work of Schübler on soil physics, published at Leipzig\r\nin 1838 under the title of “Grundsätze der Agrikulturchemie” and now\r\nalmost inaccessible outside of old libraries, is remarkable as having\r\nanticipated very definitely much that has since been brought forward\r\nand elaborated anew. He is really the father of agricultural physics.\r\n\r\n_Popular Forecasts of Soil Values._—In newly-settled countries, and\r\nstill more in those yet to be settled, the questions of the immediate\r\nproductive capacity, and the future durability of the virgin land are\r\nthe burning ones, since they determine the future of thousands for\r\nweal or woe. This need has long ago led to approximate estimates made\r\non the part of the settler, by the _observation of the native growth,\r\nespecially the tree growth_; and where this consists of familiar\r\nspecies, normally developed, such estimates on the part of experienced\r\nmen, based on previous cultural experience, are generally very\r\naccurate; so much so that in many of the newer states they have been\r\nadopted in determining not only the market value, but also the tax rate\r\nupon such lands, their productiveness, and probable durability being a\r\nmatter of common note.\r\n\r\n    Thus in the long-leaf pine uplands of the Cotton States, the\r\n    scattered settlements have fully demonstrated that after\r\n    two or three years cropping with corn, ranging from as much\r\n    as 25 bushels per acre the first year to ten and less the\r\n    third, fertilization is absolutely necessary to farther\r\n    paying cultivation. Should the short-leaved pine mingle with\r\n    the long-leaved, production may hold out for from five to\r\n    seven years. If oaks and hickory are superadded, as many\r\n    as twelve years of good production without fertilization\r\n    may be looked for by the farmer; and should the long-leaved\r\n    pine disappear altogether, the mingled growth of oaks and\r\n    short-leaved pine will encourage him to hope for from twelve\r\n    to fifteen years of fair production without fertilization.\r\n\r\nCorresponding estimates based upon the tree growth and in part also\r\nupon minor vegetation, are current in the richer lands also. The\r\n“black-oak and hickory uplands,” the “post-oak flats,” “hickory\r\nbottoms,” “gum bottoms,” “hackberry hammocks,” “post-oak prairie,”\r\n“red-cedar prairie,” and scores of other similar designations, possess\r\na very definite meaning in the minds of farmers and are constantly used\r\nas a trustworthy basis for bargain and sale, and for crop estimates.\r\nMoreover, experienced men will even after many years’ cultivation be\r\nable to distinguish these various kinds of lands from one another.\r\n\r\n_Cogency of Conclusions based upon Native Growth._—Since the native\r\nvegetation normally represents the results of secular or even\r\nmillennial adaptation of plants to climatic and soil-conditions, this\r\nuse of the native flora seems eminently rational. Moreover, it is\r\nobvious that if we were able to interpret correctly the meaning of such\r\nvegetation with respect not only to cultural conditions and crops, but\r\nalso as regards the exact physical and chemical nature of the soil, so\r\nas to recognize the _causes_ of the observed vegetative preferences; we\r\nshould be enabled to project that recognition into those cases where\r\nnative vegetation is not present to serve as a guide; and we might\r\nthus render the physical and chemical examination of soils as useful\r\npractically, _everywhere_, as is, locally, the observation of the\r\nnative growths. To a certain extent, such knowledge would be useful\r\nin determining the salient characters of cultivated soils, also; and\r\nwould be the more useful and definite in its practical indications the\r\nmore nearly the cultural history of the land is known, and the less the\r\nlatter has been changed by fertilization. For, so soon as the first\r\nflush of production has passed, the question of how to fertilize most\r\neffectually and cheaply demands solution.\r\n\r\nIt was from this standpoint, suggested by his early experience in the\r\nMiddle West and subsequently most impressively presented to him in the\r\nprosecution of the geological and agricultural survey of Mississippi,\r\nthat the writer originally undertook, in 1857, the detailed study of\r\nthe physical characters and chemical composition of soils. It seemed\r\nto him incredible that the well-defined and practically so important\r\ndistinctions based on natural vegetation, everywhere recognized and\r\ncontinually acted upon by farmers and settlers, should not be traceable\r\nto definite physical and chemical differences in the respective lands,\r\nby competent, comprehensively-trained scientific observers, whose field\r\nof vision should be broad enough to embrace concurrently the several\r\npoints of view—geological, physical, chemical and botanical—that must\r\nbe conjointly considered in forming one’s judgment of land. Such\r\ntrained observers should not merely do as well as the “untutored\r\nfarmer,” but a great deal better.\r\n\r\n_“Ecological” studies._—Yet thus far we vainly seek in general\r\nagricultural literature for any systematic or consistent studies of\r\nthese relations. We do find “ecological” lists of trees and other\r\nplants, or “plant associations,” growing in certain regions or land\r\nareas, described in some of the general terms which may refer equally\r\nwell to lands of profuse productiveness, or to such as will hardly\r\npay for taxes when cultivated. Or when the productive value is\r\nmentioned, the probable cause of such value is barely alluded to, even\r\nconjecturally, unless it be in describing the “plant formations” as\r\nxerophytic, mesophytic or hydrophytic, upon the arbitrary assumption\r\nthat moisture is the only governing factor; wholly ignoring such\r\nvitally important factors as the physical texture of the soil, its\r\ndepth, the nature of the substrata, and the (oftentimes abundantly\r\nobvious) predominant chemical nature of the land. And on the other\r\nhand, we find even public surveys proceeding upon the basis of physical\r\ndata alone, practically ignoring the botanical and chemical point of\r\nview, and inferentially denying, or at least ignoring, their relevancy\r\nto the practical problems of the farm.[107]\r\n\r\n[107] Bull. 22, Bureau of Soils, U. S. Dept. of Agriculture.\r\n\r\n_Early Soil Surveys of Kentucky, Arkansas and Mississippi._—Among\r\nthe few who during the middle of the past century maintained their\r\nbelief in the possibility of practically useful results from direct\r\nsoil investigation, were Drs. David Dale Owen and Robert Peter, who\r\nprosecuted such work extensively in connection with the geological and\r\nagricultural surveys of Kentucky and Arkansas; and the writer, who\r\ncarried out similar work in the states of Mississippi and Louisiana,\r\nwith results in many respects so definite that he has ever since\r\nregarded this as a most fruitful study, and has later continued it in\r\nCalifornia and the Pacific Northwest. This was done in the face of\r\nalmost uniform discouragement from agricultural chemists until within\r\nthe last two decades; with occasional severe criticisms of this work as\r\na waste of labor and of public funds.\r\n\r\n_Investigation of Cultivated Soils._—All this opposition was largely\r\ndue to the prejudices engendered by the futile attempts to deduce\r\npractically useful results from the chemical analysis of _soils long\r\ncultivated_, without first studying the less complex phenomena of\r\n_virgin_ soils; and these prejudices persisted longest in the United\r\nStates, even though in Europe the reaction against the hasty rejection\r\nof chemical soil work had begun some time before; as is evidenced by\r\nthe methods employed at the Rothamsted Experimental Farm in England,\r\nthe Agricultural College of France, the Russian agronomic surveys, and\r\nat several points in Germany. In none of these cases, however, more\r\nthan the purely chemical or physico-chemical standpoint was assumed;\r\nalthough in Russia at least, virgin soils were easily obtainable and\r\ntheir native growth verifiable; and were actually in part made the\r\nsubject of chemical investigation.\r\n\r\nIn the course of their work, Owen and Peter always carefully recorded\r\nthe native vegetation of the soils collected; but neither seems to\r\nhave formulated definitely the idea that such vegetation might be made\r\nthe basis of direct correlation of soil-composition with cultural\r\nexperience. Owen repeatedly expressed to the writer his conviction that\r\nsuch a correlation could be definitely established by close study; but\r\nearly death prevented his personal elaboration of the results of his\r\nwork. Peter likewise stoutly maintained to the last his conviction that\r\nsoil analysis was the key to the forecasting of cultural possibilities;\r\nbut not being a botanist he did not see his way to put such forecasts\r\ninto definite form.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Change of Views._\r\n\r\nIn the United States as well, the ancient prejudices have now gradually\r\ngiven way before the urgent call for more definite information than\r\ncould otherwise possibly be given to farmers by the experiment\r\nstations, most of whose cultural experiments, made without any definite\r\nknowledge of the nature of the soil under trial, were found to be\r\nof little value outside of their own experimental fields. Even the\r\nmultiplication of culture stations in several states, unaccompanied\r\nby soil research, is found to be a delusive repetition of the same\r\ninconclusive, random experimenting, since it takes into consideration\r\nonly the climatic differences, but leaves out of consideration the\r\npotent factors of soil quality and soil variations. At most these were\r\nusually mentioned by them in such indefinite terms as “a clay loam,”\r\n“a coarse sandy soil,” “gray sediment land,” and the like; frequently\r\nnot even with a statement of the depth and character of the subsoil and\r\nsubstrata, much less of their geological derivation or correlations.\r\nThus any one not happening to be personally acquainted with the land\r\nin question would be wholly without definite data to correlate the\r\nresults with his own case. It is quite obvious that even if only to\r\nmake possible the identification of new lands with others that have\r\nalready fallen under cultural experience, and can therefore afford\r\nuseful indications to the new settler, a close physical and chemical\r\ncharacterization of lands should be made the special object of study by\r\nthe experiment stations and public surveys, particularly in the newer\r\nstates.\r\n\r\n_Advantages for Soil Study offered by Virgin Lands._—Among the special\r\nadvantages, then, offered by virgin soils for the study of the\r\ncorrelations of soils and crops, the usual existence of a native flora,\r\nrepresenting the results of secular adaptation, is of fundamental\r\nimportance. As it is at this time still historically known of most\r\nlands west of the Alleghenies what was their original timber growth,\r\nit is clear that their original condition can still be ascertained\r\nby comparison with uncultivated lands of similar growth, usually not\r\nvery far away; and as their cultural history also is largely within\r\nthe memory of the living generation, the behavior of such lands under\r\ncultivation is known or verifiable. Foremost among the data thus\r\nascertainable is the _duration of satisfactory crop production, and\r\nits average amount_. To ascertain these surviving data by inquiry\r\namong the farming population should be among the foremost duties of\r\nthose connected with soil surveys; and persons temperamentally unable\r\nto enlist the farmer’s sympathy and interest in such inquiries must\r\nbe considered seriously handicapped, no matter what their scientific\r\nqualifications may be. In no quest is it more literally true that there\r\nis no one from whom the earnest inquirer may not learn something worth\r\nknowing.\r\n\r\n_Practical Utility of Chemical Soil-Analysis; Permanent Value_ vs.\r\n_Immediate Productiveness_.—In many existing treatises so much\r\nemphasis is given to the alleged proofs of the inutility of chemical\r\nsoil examination in particular, that a special controversion of these\r\narguments seems necessary, in connection with a detailed statement\r\nof what can, and in part has been, done in that direction. Hence the\r\noften-repeated allusion, in the sequel, to points bearing on this\r\nquestion. Hence, also, the detailed discussion of many points which in\r\nmost agricultural publications are given only passing notice.\r\n\r\n_In all these discussions the difference between_ the ascertainment of\r\nthe _permanent-productive value of soils_, as against that of their\r\n_immediate producing capacity_, must be strictly kept in view. The\r\nformer interests vitally the permanent settler or farmer; the latter\r\nconcerns the immediate outlook for crop production, the “Düngerzustand”\r\nof the Germans. The methods for the ascertainment of these two factors\r\nare wholly distinct, even though the results and their causes are\r\nin most cases intimately correlated. The failure to observe this\r\ndistinction accounts for a great deal of the obloquy and reproach that\r\nhas in the past so often been heaped upon chemical soil-analysis and\r\nits advocates.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL CONDITIONS OF PLANT GROWTH.\r\n\r\nWhile it is true that plants cannot form their substance or develop\r\nhealthy growth in the absence or scarcity of the chemical ingredients\r\nmentioned on page xxxi of this volume, it is also true that they cannot\r\nuse these unless the physical conditions of normal vegetation are first\r\nfulfilled. Both sets of conditions are intrinsically equally important\r\nand exacting as to their fulfilment; and the farmers’ task is to bring\r\nabout this concurrence to the utmost extent possible. The chemical\r\ningredients of plant-food can, however, be artificially supplied in\r\nthe form of fertilizers, should they be deficient in the soil; but as\r\nhas been shown in the preceding pages, it is not always possible to\r\ncorrect, within the limits of farm economy, physical defects existing\r\nin the land. Hence, however important is the natural richness of the\r\nsoil in plant-food, _the first care should always be given to the\r\nascertainment of the proper physical conditions in the soil, subsoil\r\nand substrata_. Without these, oftentimes, no amount of cultivation,\r\nfertilization and irrigation is effective in assuring profitable\r\ncultural results.\r\n\r\n_Condition of the Plant-food Ingredients in the Soil._—But even\r\nthe abundant _presence_ of the plant-food ingredients, as shown by\r\nanalysis, will not avail, unless at least an adequate portion of\r\nthe same exists in a form or forms accessible to plants. Of course\r\nthis condition would seem to be best fulfilled by the ingredients in\r\nquestion being in the _water-soluble_ condition. But in the first\r\nplace, plants are quite sensitive to an over-supply of soluble mineral\r\nsalts, as is evidenced by the injurious effects produced by the latter\r\nin saline and alkali lands. Furthermore, substances in that form\r\nwould be very liable to be washed or leached out of the soil by heavy\r\nrains or irrigation, and would be lost in the country drainage. It is\r\ntherefore clearly desirable that only a relatively small proportion\r\nof the useful soil-ingredients should be in the water-soluble or\r\nphysically absorbed condition, but that a larger supply should be\r\npresent in forms not so easily soluble, yet accessible to the solvent\r\naction which the acids of the soil and of the roots of plants are\r\ncapable of exercising. This _virtually_ available supply we may\r\ndesignate as the _reserve food-store_.\r\n\r\nFinally, there is practically in all soils a certain proportion of\r\nthe _soil-minerals in their original form_, as they existed in the\r\nrock-materials from which the soil was formed. These minerals being\r\nusually in a more or less finely divided or pulverulent condition, they\r\nare attacked much more rapidly by the chemically-acting “weathering”\r\nagencies, viz., water, oxygen, carbonic and humus acids, than when\r\nin solid masses; and thus, transformation of the inert rock-powder\r\ninto the other two classes of mineral soil-ingredients progresses in\r\nnaturally fertile soils with sufficient rapidity to produce, in a\r\nsingle season, sensible and practically important results, known as the\r\neffects of _fallowing_.\r\n\r\n_The Reserve._—The nature of these processes has been discussed\r\nin chapters 1 to 4; and it will be remembered that two of their\r\nmost prominent results are the _formation of clay_, and of\r\n_zeolitic-compounds_, the latter being, as heretofore stated (pp. 36\r\nff) hydrous silicates of earths and alkalies, easily decomposable by\r\nacids, and also capable of exchanging part or the whole of such basic\r\ningredients with solutions of others that may enter the soil. These\r\nzeolitic compounds therefore fulfil two important functions in the\r\npremises, viz.: a ready yielding-up of part of their ingredients to\r\nacid solvents, and a tendency to fix, by exchange, a portion or the\r\nwhole of the soluble compounds that may be set free in, or brought\r\nupon the land. The first-mentioned property is of direct avail in that\r\nthe soil-humus forms, and the roots of plants exude, acid solvents on\r\ntheir surface, and can thus draw upon the reserve store of food; the\r\nsecond tells in the direction of preventing the waste of water-soluble\r\nmanurial ingredients supplied to, or formed in the soil. (See above,\r\nchapter 3, page 38).\r\n\r\nThe reserve food-store may then be placed under the following heads:\r\n\r\n_Hydrous or “zeolitic” silicates_, from which dilute acids can take up\r\nthe bases potash, soda, lime and magnesia. These silicates may be in\r\neither the gelatinous or powdery form; in the former case they may also\r\nocclude water-soluble substances.\r\n\r\n_Carbonates of lime and magnesia_, which are readily dissolved by\r\ncarbonated water as well as by the vegetable acids.\r\n\r\n_Phosphates of lime and magnesia_, not very readily soluble in\r\ncarbonated water, but more readily attacked by the acids of the soil\r\nand of plant roots; thus supplying phosphoric acid to plants. The more\r\nfinely divided they are the more readily they are dissolved; some soils\r\ncontaining only crystalline needles of apatite (see chap. 5, p. 63)\r\nonly are nevertheless poor in available phosphoric acid.\r\n\r\nThe natural phosphates of iron and alumina are practically insoluble\r\nin all solvents at the disposal of vegetation and though present in\r\nconsiderable amounts in some soils, (see chapter 19, page 355), may be\r\nconsidered as being permanently inert, and therefore not to be counted\r\namong the soil resources for plant nutrition. As yet no artificial\r\nprocess by which their phosphoric acid can be made available within the\r\nsoil, has been discovered.\r\n\r\n_Water-soluble Ingredients._—As regards these it has already been\r\nexplained that they are largely retained in the condition of purely\r\nphysical adsorption, as in the case of charcoal or quartz sand, through\r\nwhich sea water filters and is thereby partially deprived of its\r\nsalts. But these can be gradually withdrawn by washing with pure water\r\nalone, and still more easily when stronger solvents are used. Since\r\nthe soil-water is always more or less charged with carbonic acid, and\r\nthe roots themselves secrete carbonic as well as stronger acids in\r\ntheir absorption of mineral plant-food, there is no difficulty about\r\nexplaining the manner in which such physically condensed ingredients\r\nare taken up.[108]\r\n\r\n[108] Whitney (Bull. 22, U. S. Bureau of Soils) claims on the basis\r\nof a large number of (three-minute) extractions of soils made with\r\ndistilled water, that these solutions are essentially of the same\r\ncomposition in all soils; that all soils contain enough plant-food to\r\nproduce crops indefinitely; and that the differences in production\r\nare due wholly to differences in the moisture supply, which he\r\nclaims is, aside from climate, the only governing factor in plant\r\ngrowth. The tables of analytical results given in Bull. 22 fail to\r\nsustain the first contention; the second is pointedly contradicted\r\nboth by practical experience, and by thousands of cumulative culture\r\nexperiments made by scientific observers; the third fails with the\r\nsecond, except of course in so far as an adequate supply of moisture\r\nis known to be an absolute condition both of plant growth, and the\r\nutilization of plant-food. It is moreover well known that it is not\r\nwater alone, but water impregnated more or less with humic and carbonic\r\nacids, that is the active solvent surrounding the plant root.\r\n\r\n_Recognition of the Prominent Chemical Character of Soils._ In a former\r\nchapter the soils formed from the several minerals and rocks have been\r\ndiscussed in a general manner. We can as a rule obtain some insight\r\ninto the nature of any soil which we can trace to its parent rock or\r\nrocks, if we are acquainted with the composition of the latter.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, but in a much more direct manner, we can obtain a\r\nstrong presumption as to the nature of any soil by determining the\r\nundecomposed minerals present in it. In all ordinary cases the\r\npresumption must be that the decomposed portion of the soil has been\r\nderived from the minerals still found in it. Of course it may happen\r\nin the case of lands derived from widely distinct and distant regions\r\nthat no such characteristic minerals can be found; this is very\r\ncommonly true of the soils forming the deltas of large rivers, in\r\nwhich sometimes the only remaining recognizable mineral is quartz in\r\nits several forms, with occasional grains of such hardy minerals as\r\ntourmaline, garnet, etc. Apart from such cases, the hand lens or the\r\nmicroscope permits us to recognize in most soils the minerals that have\r\nmainly contributed to their formation, thus also gaining a clew to\r\ntheir prominent chemical nature.\r\n\r\nSuch recognition sometimes involves, of course, a somewhat intimate\r\nknowledge of mineralogy; yet a little practice will enable almost\r\nany one to identify the more important soil-forming minerals, under\r\nthe lens or microscope, according to the degree of abrasion or\r\ndecomposition they may have undergone. The details of such researches\r\nlie outside of the limits of this treatise, but some general directions\r\non the subject are given farther on.[109]\r\n\r\n[109] See Appendix B.\r\n\r\n_Acidity, Neutrality, Alkalinity._—A test never to be omitted is that\r\nof the reaction of the soil on litmus or other test paper, to ascertain\r\nits acid, neutral or alkaline reaction. Should the latter occur quickly\r\n(by the prompt blueing of red litmus paper), “black alkali” would be\r\nindicated; but a blueing after 20 to 30 minutes means merely that\r\na sufficiency of lime carbonate is present. An acid reaction (the\r\nreddening of blue litmus paper) of course indicates a “sour” soil (see\r\nchap. 8, page 122).\r\n\r\n_Chemical Analysis of Soils._—When the observations mentioned above\r\ngive no very decisive results or inferences as to the soil’s chemical\r\ncharacter, the more elaborate processes of qualitative and quantitative\r\nchemical analysis may be called in. It would seem at first sight that\r\nthese ought to yield very definite results to guide the cultivator; yet\r\nsuch is by no means always the case. Both the previous history of the\r\nland, and the method of analysis, influence materially the practical\r\nutility of the results of chemical soil analysis.\r\n\r\nThe cause of this uncertainty becomes obvious when we consider the\r\nthree groups of ingredients outlined above, viz., the insoluble or\r\nunavailable, wholly _undecomposed rock minerals_; the “_reserve_,”\r\nconsisting of compounds not soluble in water but soluble in or\r\ndecomposable by weak acids; and the _water-soluble portion_, either\r\nactually dissolved in the water held by the soil, or held by the soil\r\nitself in (physical) absorption. While the latter portion is directly\r\nand immediately available to plants, the amounts thus held are usually\r\nquite small, and (outside of alkali lands) would rarely suffice for\r\nthe needs of a crop during a growing season.[110] This demand must be\r\nmaterially supplemented by what can be made available from the soil\r\nminerals and the “reserve” by weathering, conjoined with the direct\r\naction of the acids secreted from the plant’s root-hairs upon the soil\r\nparticles to which they are attached. It is obvious that the greater\r\nor less _abundance_ of the plant-food in the soil-material upon which\r\nthese processes may be brought to bear, must essentially influence the\r\nadequacy of the plant-food thus supplied. Moreover, the greater or less\r\nextent to which these sources may have been drawn upon previously in\r\nthe course of cultivation, will similarly influence that adequacy, on\r\naccount of the diminution of the readily available supply.\r\n\r\n[110] The investigations of King (On the Influence of Soil Management\r\nupon the Water Soluble Salts in Soils and the Yield of Crops, Madison,\r\n1903) show that from some soils at least, a sufficiency of plant-food\r\ningredients for a season’s crop may be dissolved by distilled water\r\nalone, if the soil be repeatedly leached and dried at 110°. Whether\r\nsuch a supply can be expected under field conditions, remains to be\r\ntested.\r\n\r\n_Water-soluble and Acid-soluble Portions most Important._—It thus\r\nseems that while the undecomposed rock minerals are indicative of the\r\nnature of the soil, but not directly concerned in plant nutrition, the\r\nmost direct interest attaches to the _water-soluble portion_, and the\r\n_acid-soluble_ reserve. Both of these can, of course, be withdrawn from\r\nthe soil by treatment with acids of greater or less strength; and it\r\nwould seem that if we knew just what is the kind and strength of the\r\nacid solvent employed by each plant, we could so imitate their action\r\nas to determine definitely whether or not the soil contains an adequate\r\nor deficient supply of actually available food for the coming crop.\r\n\r\n_We Cannot Imitate Plant-root Action._—In this, however, we encounter\r\nserious difficulties. The acids secreted by the plant roots are not the\r\nonly solvents active in the dissolution of plant-food; as yet we know\r\nthe nature of only a few; and even these, instead of acting for a long\r\ntime (season) on a relatively small number of soil particles touched by\r\nthe root-hairs, can in our laboratories only be allowed to act for a\r\nshort time on the entire soil-mass. Clearly, the results thus obtained\r\ncannot be a direct measure of the amount of plant-food which a plant\r\nmay take up in a given time; we can only gain comparative figures.\r\nThese, however, can be utilized by comparison with actual cultural\r\nexperience obtained in similar cases.\r\n\r\n_Cultural experience_ must, of course, be the final test in all these\r\nquestions; and it is generally more fruitful to investigate the causes\r\nunderlying such actual practical experience, than to attempt to supply,\r\nartificially, the supposed conditions of plant growth. The latter are\r\nso complex and so difficult of control, that the results obtained\r\nby synthetic, small-scale experiments are constantly liable to the\r\nsuspicion that they are partly or wholly due to other causes than those\r\npurposely supplied by the experimenter.\r\n\r\n    _Analysis of Cultivated Soils._—It is also clear that\r\n    in view of the inevitable complexity of the conditions\r\n    governing vegetable growth, we should whenever feasible\r\n    proceed from the more simple to the more complex. The\r\n    failure to conform to this rule in soil investigation has\r\n    been the cause of an enormous waste of energy and work\r\n    bestowed, at the very outset, upon the most complex problem\r\n    of all, viz., the investigation of soils long cultivated\r\n    and manured; lands which, having been subject perhaps\r\n    for centuries to a great and wholly indefinite variety\r\n    of crops and cultural practices, had thereby become so\r\n    beset with artificial conditions that without a previous\r\n    knowledge of what constitutes the normal regime in natural\r\n    soils, the correlation of their chemical constitution, as\r\n    ascertainable by our present methods, with their production\r\n    under culture, became as complex a problem as that of\r\n    motions of three mutually gravitating points in space.\r\n    Neither can be solved by the ordinary processes of analysis,\r\n    chemical or mathematical. Nevertheless, though it was at\r\n    one time contended that the minute proportion of plant-food\r\n    ingredients withdrawn from soils by cultivation could not\r\n    be detected by quantitative analysis, numerous examples\r\n    have shown that with our present more delicate methods this\r\n    can in most cases be done, though not always after a single\r\n    year’s crop.\r\n\r\n    _Methods of Soil Analysis._—The more or less incisive\r\n    solvent agents used in extracting a soil for analysis will\r\n    of course produce results widely at variance with each\r\n    other. When fusion with carbonate of soda, or treatment\r\n    with fluohydric acid is resorted to, we obtain for each\r\n    soil-ingredient the sum of all the amounts contained in\r\n    each of the three categories—the unchanged minerals, the\r\n    zeolitic “reserve,” and the water-soluble portion. It was\r\n    early recognized that the results of such analyses bear no\r\n    intelligible relation to the productive capacity of soils;\r\n    for pulverized rocks of many kinds, or volcanic ashes\r\n    freshly ejected and notoriously incapable of supporting\r\n    plant growth, might be made to give exactly the same\r\n    composition. The amounts of plant-food ingredients thus\r\n    shown might be several hundreds or thousands of times\r\n    greater than what one crop would take from the soil, and\r\n    yet not an ear of grain could be produced on the material.\r\n    The only case in which any useful information could be thus\r\n    obtained would be that of the absence, or great scarcity, of\r\n    one or more of the plant-food ingredients.\r\n\r\n    The next step was to use in soil analysis acids of such\r\n    strength as to dissolve all the zeolitic (and water-soluble)\r\n    portion, leaving the unweathered soil minerals behind; it\r\n    being assumed that the prolonged action of the roots and\r\n    soil-solvents would in the end act similarly to the acids\r\n    employed, such as chlorhydric or nitric acids.\r\n\r\n    But here also the results of analysis very commonly failed\r\n    to correspond to cultural experience in the case of\r\n    _cultivated_ soils; which frequently failed utterly\r\n    to produce satisfactory crops even when the acid-analysis\r\n    had shown an abundance of plant-food ingredients. Upon\r\n    this evidence, this method of soil investigation was also\r\n    condemned as being of little or no practical utility; and\r\n    this has ever since been a widely prevalent view.\r\n\r\nThe preferable investigation of cultivated soils was due to the fact\r\nthat they are practically the only ones _available_ in the countries\r\nwhere the study of agricultural science was then being prosecuted;\r\nand the paucity of useful results there achieved discouraged the\r\nundertaking of similar researches where, as in the United States,\r\nthe materials for the investigation of the simpler cases—those of\r\nunchanged, natural or virgin soils—were readily accessible. It was\r\nnot apparent on the surface that the indefinitely varied conditions\r\nintroduced by long culture would inevitably cause this lack of definite\r\ncorrelation between the immediate productive capacity of a soil and\r\nthe composition of its acid-soluble portion, and that yet the same\r\nmight not be true of natural, uncultivated soils, which have all been\r\nsubjected, alike, only to the natural processes of weathering, and to\r\nthe annual return of nearly the whole of the ingredients withdrawn by\r\nplant growth.\r\n\r\nFollowing the failure of the treatment with strong acids to yield\r\nwith cultivated soils results definitely correlated with cultural\r\nexperience, numerous attempts were made to gain better indications\r\nby the employment of weaker acid solvents. The pure arbitrariness of\r\nsuch diluted solvents was equaled by the total indefiniteness and\r\nirrelevance of the results with different soils. Only two rational\r\nalternatives seem to remain, viz., either to push the extraction to\r\nthe full extent beyond which action becomes so slow as to clearly\r\nexclude any farther effective action of plant acids; or else to use the\r\nlatter themselves at such strengths as by actual experiment is found\r\nto exist in their root sap. The first alternative aims to ascertain\r\nthe _permanent productive values_ of soils; the latter to test\r\ntheir _immediate productive capacity_. Both alternatives are purely\r\nempirical, and derive their only claim to practical value from their\r\naccordance with practical experience (see chapter 19).\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SOLVENT ACTION OF WATER UPON SOILS.\r\n\r\nThe almost universal solvent power of pure water has already been\r\nalluded to in chapter 2 (see p. 18), and illustrated by the analyses\r\nof drain and river waters. While these convey a general idea of the\r\nchief substances dissolved and carried off, the direct investigation\r\nof the solutions actually obtainable from the soil by longer treatment\r\nand with no more water than is compatible with the welfare of ordinary\r\ncrops, necessarily gives somewhat different results. For when drains\r\nflow during or after heavy rains the water has not time to become\r\nsaturated. The following data afford a clearer insight into the actual\r\nand possible solvent effects of water in the soil, and its possible\r\nadequacy to plant nutrition unaided by acid solvents.\r\n\r\n_Extraction of Soils with Pure Water._—Eichhorn and Wunder treated\r\nsoils from Bonn, and from Chemnitz (Saxony) respectively for ten days\r\nand four weeks with about one-third of their weight of water; the\r\nsolutions thus obtained contain in 1,000,000 parts:\r\n\r\n    ==========================+=======+===========\r\n                              | Bonn. | Chemnitz.\r\n    --------------------------+-------+-----------\r\n    Silica                    |  48.0 |   25.7\r\n    Potash (K₂O)              | 115.4 |    7.5\r\n    Soda (Na₂O)               |  11.0 |   30.4\r\n    Lime (CaO)                | 128.0 |   83.6\r\n    Magnesia (MgO)            |  38.4 |   37.4\r\n    Peroxid of Iron (Fe₂O₃)   | Trace |   11.7\r\n    Alumina (Al₂O₃)           |   ?   |    ?\r\n    Phosphoric acid (P₂O₅)    |  31.0 |  Trace\r\n    Sulfuric acid (SO₃)       | 100.2 |\r\n    Chlorid of Sodium (NaCl)  |  58.6 |   47.6\r\n    ---------------------------+-------+-----------\r\n\r\nThese figures differ widely in most respects from those given for drain\r\nand river waters. Potash especially is far more abundantly present in\r\nthe Bonn-soil solution than in the drain water, and so is phosphoric\r\nacid; while lime is not widely different. Eichhorn therefore calculates\r\nthat with a reasonably adequate supply of water, these ingredients\r\nwould fully suffice for a full crop of wheat. The Chemnitz soil, on the\r\nother hand, does not yield enough plant-food for more than a very small\r\ncrop upon the same assumptions.\r\n\r\n_Continuous Solubility of Soil-ingredients._—It seems to be impossible\r\nto exhaust a soil’s solubility by repeated or continuous leaching with\r\nwater. This was demonstrated in 1863 and 1864 by Ulbricht[111] and\r\nby Schultze;[112] their general conclusions have quite lately been\r\ncorroborated by King,[113] as the result of extended and very careful\r\ninvestigations.\r\n\r\nSchultze experimented on a rich soil from Mecklenburg, by continuous\r\nleaching with distilled water for six days, one liter passing every\r\ntwenty-four hours, with the following results.\r\n\r\n[111] Vers.

The rich soil used in this case\r\ngave results corresponding in general to these from the Bonn soil, in\r\nthe previous table. From a poorer soil similarly treated by Ulbricht,\r\ndescribed by him as a ferruginous sand from Dahme, the leaching of\r\nwhich was continued for thirty days in periods of three days each, with\r\na total of forty times its weight of water, the results were as follows:\r\n\r\n          SOIL OF LOW PRODUCTION FROM DAHME (Ulbricht).\r\n        THE SEVERAL EXTRACTS CONTAINED IN 1,000,000 PARTS:\r\n    ============+========+========+========+========+========+========\r\n                | First  | Second | Third  | Fourth | Fifth  | Sixth\r\n                |Extract.|Extract.|Extract.|Extract.|Extract.|Extract.\r\n    ------------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------\r\n    Potash      |    7   |    6   |    7   |    7   |        |    3\r\n    Soda        |   41   |   11   |   26   |   17   |        |    8\r\n    Lime        |   96   |   70   |   55   |   48   |   62   |\r\n    Magnesia    |   14   |   10   |    9   |    7   |    8   |\r\n    Phosphoric  |        |        |        |        |        |\r\n         acid   | trace  |    2   | trace  |    1   |        |\r\n                + -----  +   --   + -----  +   --   |   --   +   --\r\n      Totals    |  158   |   99   |   97   |   80   |   70   |   11\r\n    ------------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that there is a considerable difference both in the\r\ntotal amounts of matters dissolved and in the phosphoric acid taken out\r\nby the water, as compared with the rich soil treated by Schultze. The\r\nuniformity of the amounts of potash removed at the successive leachings\r\nis remarkable.\r\n\r\n_King’s Results._—The same general features are again strikingly\r\nillustrated by King’s results, as given in the following table. King’s\r\nfirst leachings were always made by shaking up the soil with ten times\r\nits dry weight of water for three minutes, then after subsidence\r\nfiltering the solutions through a Chamberland (porcelain biscuit)\r\nfilter, and then (without evaporation) determining the ingredients\r\ndissolved, by very delicate, mostly colorimetric methods. Subsequent\r\nleachings were made by packing the soil around the filters and washing\r\nwith five times the weight of water, taking about fifteen minutes\r\neach time; but drying the soil at 120 degrees C. between successive\r\nleachings.\r\n\r\n         WATER EXTRACTION OF SOILS OF LOW AND HIGH PRODUCTION,\r\n                        BY F.

At each drying not only are the soluble matters\r\nagain drawn to the surface, but heating a soil even to 100° renders\r\nadditional amounts of soil ingredients soluble both in water and in\r\nacids. It can scarcely be doubted that the intense heating which desert\r\nsoils undergo during the warm season is similarly effective; and thus\r\nthe great productiveness of these soils under irrigation, and the\r\nmarvelously rapid development of the native vegetation when rains\r\nmoisten the parched soil, is in part at least accounted for by this\r\nimmediate availability of a large supply of plant-food.\r\n\r\n[114] Bulletin No. 22, Bureau of Soils, U. S. D. A.\r\n\r\n_Composition of Janesville loam._—In connection with the above data\r\ngiven by King, it is interesting to note the composition of the soil\r\nin the above table yielding the highest proportions of soluble matter,\r\nwhen analyzed according to the method practiced by the writer (see\r\nchap. 19, p. 343). This analysis was made under the supervision of\r\nProfessor Jaffa in the laboratory of the California Experiment Station\r\nby Assistant Charles A. Triebel.\r\n\r\n    _Loam Soil from Janesville, Wisconsin_; sample sent by\r\n    Prof. F. H. King, Madison, Wis.\r\n\r\n    This soil is a light friable loam, resembling the northern\r\n    Loess in color and texture; it is highly productive. It is\r\n    underlaid at 5 feet by the drift gravel of that region,\r\n    enclosing much calcareous material, which evidently has had\r\n    a large share in the formation of this soil, just as is the\r\n    case in southern Michigan.\r\n\r\n    The soil, when dried at 110° C, consisted of\r\n\r\n      CHEMICAL ANALYSIS OF FINE EARTH.\r\n\r\n    Insoluble matter               69.35\r\n    Soluble silica                 10.89\r\n    Potash (KO₂)                     .59\r\n    Soda (Na₂O)                      .04\r\n    Lime (CaO)                       .83\r\n    Magnesia (MgO)                   .51\r\n    Br. ox. of Manganese (Mn₃O₄)     .08\r\n    Peroxid of Iron (Fe₂O₃)         3.60\r\n    Alumina (Al₂O₃)                 5.26\r\n    Phosphoric acid (P₂O₃)           .06\r\n    Sulfuric acid (SO₃)              .10\r\n    Water and organic matter        8.72\r\n                                  ------\r\n                Total             100.03\r\n\r\n    It will be noted that in accordance with the interpretation\r\n    of analyses of soils as given in the next chapter, this is\r\n    a high-class soil in every respect, except that its content\r\n    of phosphoric acid is only just above the lower limit of\r\n    sufficiency. But as is also shown below, in presence of a\r\n    large supply of lime even lower percentages of phosphoric\r\n    acid are adequate for long-continued production (see chap.\r\n    19, pp. 354, 365) by rendering the substance more freely\r\n    available; and that this is true in this case is shown by\r\n    the result of King’s leachings, in which this soil yields\r\n    a maximum of 419 parts per million as against 80 and 64\r\n    parts in the poor soils, which at the same time yield only\r\n    one fourth as much of lime. Unfortunately we have no full\r\n    analyses of these other soils for comparison; although\r\n    they have served as a basis of comparison for years in the\r\n    Washington Bureau of Soils.\r\n\r\n_Solubility of Soil Phosphates in Water._—The solubility of the\r\nphosphate contents of soils has been elaborately investigated by\r\nTh. Schloesing fils.[115] He found in the case of a number of soils\r\ninvestigated by him that the amount of phosphoric acid P₂O₅ in the\r\nsoil-solution ranged from less than one millionth (or one milligram\r\nper liter of water) in a poor soil, to over three milligrams in a rich\r\none. He also found that for one and the same soil the amount so found\r\nwas constant, if about a week’s time were allowed for saturation. He\r\ncalculates that while in general the amount of phosphoric acid capable\r\nof being supplied to the crop during a growing season of twenty-eight\r\nto thirty weeks would suffice for but few crops, the supply so afforded\r\nis in no case a negligible quantity, frequently amounting to more than\r\nhalf of the crop-requirements. Experiments with various crops prove\r\nthat these dilute solutions are utilized by all of them, sometimes to\r\nthe extent of completely consuming the content of the solution. The\r\nmuch smaller content of phosphoric acid in drain waters is accounted\r\nfor by the lack of time for full saturation during the time that the\r\nflow lasts. Whitney, (Bureau of Soils, Bulletin 22) has extracted\r\nthe soil-solution by means of the centrifuge from several soils; the\r\ncontents of phosphoric acid thus found are in general of the same order\r\nas those shown in the preceding table by King, but much in excess of\r\nSchloesing’s figures; notwithstanding the fact that Whitney’s soils had\r\nbeen in contact with water for only twenty-four hours. The cause of\r\nthis wide discrepancy is not clear.\r\n\r\n[115] Ann. de la Sci. Agron., 2de série tome I, pp. 416-349; 1899.\r\n\r\n_Practical Conclusions from Water Extraction._—As regards the\r\npractically useful conclusions to be drawn from the extraction of soils\r\nwith pure water, the data given above, and especially the results\r\nobtained by King, seem to prove that there is a more or less definite\r\ncorrelation between the immediate productiveness of soils and the\r\namount and kinds of ingredients dissolved; especially in the case of\r\nphosphoric acid, the adequacy of the supply of which for immediate\r\nproduction is assumed to be thus demonstrable by many French chemists.\r\nMoreover, a number of King’s results, tabulated in curves, exhibit\r\na remarkable general parallelism of the curves showing totals of\r\nplant-food extracted by water, and actual crop production. This is the\r\nmore remarkable since it is known to be, not pure water, but such as is\r\nmore or less impregnated with carbonic acid at least, that is actually\r\nactive in soil-solution and plant-nutrition. The farther development of\r\nthis method may, it would seem, lead to definite conclusions at least\r\nin respect to the immediate productive capacity of cultivated, and\r\nperhaps also of virgin soils. But it is not likely to give any definite\r\nclew as to the _durability_ of such lands.\r\n\r\n\r\nASCERTAINMENT OF THE IMMEDIATE PLANT-FOOD REQUIREMENTS OF CULTIVATED\r\nSOILS BY PHYSIOLOGICAL TESTS. PHYSIOLOGICAL SOIL-ANALYSIS.\r\n\r\nAs has already been stated, the quantitative analysis of cultivated\r\nsoils by means of strong acids affords a presumptive insight into their\r\nimmediate productiveness, and the kind of fertilizer needed to improve\r\nit, only in case of the extreme deficiency of one or several of the\r\nchiefly important plant-foods. The limits of deficiency of these in\r\nvirgin soils have been discussed above; but since in cultivated soils\r\namounts of soluble plant-food so small as to be beyond the limits\r\nof ordinary analytical determinations, when distributed through an\r\nacre-foot of soil may, when rightly applied, nevertheless produce very\r\ndecided effects, the indications thus obtainable are not absolute. Thus\r\na dressing of 150 lbs. of Chile saltpeter, containing only about 24\r\nlbs. of nitrogen, is capable of causing the production of a full crop\r\nof wheat where otherwise, even under favorable physical conditions,\r\nonly a fraction of a crop would have been harvested; _provided_, that\r\nall the other requisite ingredients were present to a sufficient\r\nextent and in available form. Yet the amount of nitrogen thus added\r\nwould amount, in one acre-foot of soil to only .0008%, say eight\r\nten-thousandths of one percent; which, with the amounts of substance\r\nusually employed in soil analysis, would be an unweighable quantity,\r\nand might easily be overlooked.\r\n\r\nSince the amounts of potash and phosphoric acid actually taken out of\r\nthe soil by one crop are in general of the same order of magnitude as\r\nthe above, what is taken out by one or two crops will usually fall\r\nwithin the limits of analytical errors, especially of those incurred\r\nin sampling the soil. Yet that the changes caused by a number of\r\nsuccessive crops can be proved, even by the ordinary methods, has been\r\nabundantly verified. For it seems that the losses of soil ingredients\r\nin cultivated lands exceed considerably those calculated from the\r\nactual drain represented by the crops.\r\n\r\n_Plot Tests._—There is, however, an obvious and apparently simple\r\nmethod by which every farmer might make his own fertilizer tests, on\r\na small and inexpensive scale, the results of which may afterwards be\r\nput in effect on his entire land. It is to apply in proper proportions\r\non plots (of say from one twentieth to one fortieth of an acre), the\r\nseveral plant-food ingredients usually supplied in fertilizers, singly\r\nas well as conjointly with each other, leaving check unfertilized plots\r\naround as well as among them. By comparison with these, the cultural\r\nresults should at once determine which of the fertilizers can most\r\nadvantageously be applied to the land. Such tests when carried out with\r\nall the proper precautions are often very decisive and practically\r\nsuccessful. But they so frequently suffer from seasonal influences\r\n(such as scanty or excessive rainfall, cold or heat, etc.), inequality\r\nof soil conditions, failure to apply the fertilizers at the right time,\r\nor in the right way, the depredations of insects and birds, and other\r\ncauses, that it generally takes several seasons’ trial to obtain any\r\ndefinite results. On level lands of uniform nature and depth, they are\r\nmost likely to be successful; while on undulating or hill lands it is\r\nnot only very difficult to secure uniformity of soil and subsoil on\r\nareas of sufficient size, but also to prevent the washing of fertilized\r\nsoil, or fertilizer in solution, from one plot to the other by the\r\ninfluence of heavy rains or irrigation; thus wholly vitiating the\r\nexperiments. In very many cases, especially in the arid region, the\r\nresults of such trials have been practically _nil_, for the reason that\r\nphysical defects of the soil, and not lack of plant-food, were the\r\ncause of unsatisfactory production.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Scheme for Plot-tests of Fertilizers.]\r\n\r\nA full examination of physical conditions, as outlined in previous\r\nchapters, should _in all cases precede_ the application of fertilizers;\r\nsuch examination will at the same time serve to determine the greater\r\nor less uniformity of soil-conditions, which is of first importance\r\nto the cogency of fertilizer tests. As a matter of fact, few farmers\r\npossess the necessary qualifications to carry out such tests\r\nsuccessfully, since their execution requires a certain familiarity\r\nnot only with the principles and methods of experimentation, but also\r\nthe faculty and practice of close and reasoning observation; which,\r\nunfortunately, is not as yet a part of instruction in our schools.\r\nThe experience so often had in co-operative work between experiment\r\nstations and farmers is cogent on this point.\r\n\r\nThose desiring to do such work, however, can make use of something like\r\nthe plan given above; it being understood that in the case of clay\r\nsoils, the unplanted paths left between the plots should be at least\r\ntwo feet in width; in the case of sandy soils the distance should be\r\nnot less than three feet, and more if the plots are located on a slope.\r\nThe crop from each plot should if possible be weighed as a whole; but\r\nif the plot be large and the crop measurably uniform, an aliquot part,\r\nsuch as one fourth, may be weighed instead. In regular experimentation\r\nthe crops are weighed both in the green (freshly cut) condition, and\r\nafter drying. Since the dry matter is the real basis of value in the\r\ncase of most field crops, its weight is the most important; as the\r\nwater-content of green crops may vary considerably. But in the case\r\nof vegetables as well as fruit crops, not only must the weight of the\r\nfresh crop be determined, but it should be sorted into the “marketable”\r\nand “unmarketable” sizes and qualities. Failure to do this may vitiate\r\nthe entire experiment for practical purposes.\r\n\r\n_Pot Culture Tests._—The uncertainty attending plot culture tests\r\non account of the difficulty of controlling seasonal and other\r\nexternal conditions, has resulted in the extended adoption of indoor\r\nculture tests, usually conducted in zinc or “galvanized” cylinders\r\nof a size sufficient to contain from twelve to twenty or more\r\npounds of soil. These are kept in a green-house whose temperature\r\nand moisture-condition can be regulated at will, and where the\r\nsoil-moisture is wholly under control. For investigations of the\r\neffects of various kinds of plant-food upon vegetable development, this\r\nmethod has served most satisfactorily and effectually, and striking\r\nphotographs of results thus obtained are seen on all hands: for which\r\nreason, to save space, they have not been introduced into this volume.\r\nIt seems at first sight that the same method should serve admirably to\r\ndetermine the manure-requirements of soils under controlled conditions.\r\n\r\nIt must, however, be remembered that the field conditions as regards\r\nsubsoil, evaporation, ascent of moisture from below, penetration and\r\nspread of roots, etc., in other words, all the physical conditions\r\nso vitally concerned in crop production, except the temperature and\r\nmoisture-condition of the soil, are wholly left out of consideration in\r\nthis method. Hence the application of the results so obtained to actual\r\nfield conditions can only be made with great caution, and are often\r\nwidely discrepant with actual experience.\r\n\r\n    The method has of late been carried to an extreme by the\r\n    U. S. Bureau of Soils in the proposition to supplant\r\n    the large soil-pots heretofore used by small paraffined\r\n    wire-cloth baskets, 3 × 3 inches in size, in which the\r\n    soil to be tested is sown with seeds which are allowed to\r\n    develop only for three to five weeks; it being claimed\r\n    that the development occurring during that time is quite\r\n    sufficient to indicate what will be the ultimate outcome\r\n    in crop production. But practical experience has long ago\r\n    demonstrated that these early stages of growth cannot be\r\n    relied upon to show the crop results to be expected. Yet if\r\n    this minute scale of pot-culture should, on further test,\r\n    prove to give truthful forecasts even in a mere majority of\r\n    cases, the facility with which it may be carried out will\r\n    entitle it to favorable consideration. A great deal more\r\n    proof is needed on this point than the confident claims of\r\n    the Bureau indicate.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEMICAL TESTS OF IMMEDIATE PRODUCTIVENESS.\r\n\r\n_Testing chemical soil-character by crop analysis._—Another method for\r\nthe determination of immediate soil requirements has been elaborated\r\nby E. Godlewski.[116] The principle upon which this method rests is\r\nthat plants growing in a soil deficient in available plant-food of\r\nany one kind will in their ash show a corresponding deficiency, or at\r\nleast a minimum proportion of the same; and that in many cases, the\r\nnature of the deficiency manifests itself in the form or development of\r\nthe plant, so clearly as to render chemical analysis unnecessary (see\r\nbelow, chapter 22).\r\n\r\n[116] Zeitschr. Landw. Vers. Oesterr., 1901.\r\n\r\nTo a certain extent the latter idea has been and is constantly being\r\nutilized in practice. It is essentially involved in the habit of\r\njudging of land by its natural vegetation; and by agricultural chemists\r\nand intelligent farmers, when they check excessive growth of stems and\r\nleaf (indicating excess of nitrogen) by the use of lime or phosphates;\r\nor prescribe the use of nitrogenous manures when a superabundance of\r\nsmall, unmarketable fruit is produced. From the coincidence of such\r\nindications with the results of the analyses of soils and ashes,\r\nvery definite and permanently valuable indications as to the proper\r\nfertilization and other treatment of the land may be deduced.\r\n\r\n    Godlewski insists strongly, and with a good deal of\r\n    plausibility, upon the importance of making such trials in\r\n    the open field and not merely in pots. While this is true,\r\n    it is also true that such field experiments suffer from the\r\n    same liability to imperfection as the “plot fertilizer-test”\r\n    plan just described; viz., that the season may exert a much\r\n    more powerful influence than the fertilization, and the\r\n    tests may lead to wholly erroneous conclusions unless the\r\n    experiments are continued for a number of years, and under\r\n    skilled supervision. But when once the normal ratio between\r\n    the ash ingredients for a particular soil and climatic\r\n    region have been ascertained, the data will be of lasting\r\n    benefit to agriculture there, and perhaps, other things\r\n    being equal, to the world at large.\r\n\r\nH. Vanderyst has discussed the entire subject of physiological soil\r\nanalysis elaborately in the Revue Génerale Agronomique of Louvain,\r\n1902-3 (Exp’t St. Record, April 1904, Vol. 8, page 757) and shows in\r\ndetail the conditions under which it may be successful. Among these he\r\nreckons as full a knowledge of the chemical characteristics of a soil\r\nas can be obtained by chemical analysis.\r\n\r\n_Chemical Tests of Immediately Available Plant-food._—It is scarcely\r\ndoubtful that plants differ considerably in the energy of their action\r\nupon the “reserve” soil ingredients; hence no one solvent used by\r\nthe analyst could represent correctly the action of plant-roots in\r\ngeneral upon the soil, even if we could give that action the same\r\ntime (a growing season) and opportunity afforded them in nature by\r\nthe root-surface. We are forced to proceed empirically; and among the\r\nnumerous solvents suggested for the purpose of soil extraction, that of\r\nDyer, already mentioned, viz., a one per cent solution of citric acid,\r\nmaking allowance for such neutralization as may occur in the soil, has\r\nseemed to the writer to give results most largely in agreement with\r\ncultural experience. Walter Maxwell has recommended aspartic acid in\r\nlieu of citric, as approaching nearer to practical results, at least\r\nwith sugar-cane.\r\n\r\nAccording to the investigations of Dyer, on Rothamstead soils of\r\nknown productiveness or manurial condition, it appears that when the\r\ncitric-acid extraction yields as much as .005% of potash and .010% of\r\nphosphoric acid, the supply is adequate for normal crop production,\r\nso that the use of the above substances as fertilizers would be, if\r\nnot ineffective, at least not a profitable investment. These figures\r\nrefer to the ordinary field crops of England and to soils originally\r\nfertile and well supplied with lime. It can readily be foreseen that\r\nunder other climatic and soil conditions, different figures may have to\r\nbe established. So far as the writer’s experience goes, however, the\r\nabove figures are very nearly valid for the arid climates as well; only\r\nthe figures obtained for arid soils are usually far in excess of the\r\nabove minimum postulates. Figures for lime and nitrogen are given in\r\nchapters 8 and 19. But the results obtained with the highly ferruginous\r\nsoils of Hawaii show that under such conditions, figures far exceeding\r\nthe minimum ones established by Dyer nevertheless coexist with need of\r\nphosphate fertilization.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nTHE ANALYSIS OF VIRGIN SOILS BY EXTRACTION WITH STRONG ACIDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs stated already, the analysis of soils by extraction with strong\r\nacids is intended to enlighten us, not in regard to their _immediate_\r\nproductiveness (the “Düngerzustand” of German agricultural chemists),\r\nbut as to their _permanent value or productive capacity_. As has been\r\nseen in the preceding chapter, the efforts to unite investigators\r\nupon a generally applicable and acceptable method for the testing of\r\nimmediate productiveness have not been very successful, and the number\r\nof methods employed in different countries and by different chemists\r\nwithin the same country are widely at variance, with no immediate\r\nprospect of agreement. Moreover, in most cases the effort is to combine\r\nboth problems—_temporary_ and _permanent_ productive capacity—in _one_\r\nmethod or operation; which still farther confuses the issue.\r\n\r\nConvinced that the only way to unification lies in the direction of\r\nfalling back upon a method that is based upon a natural limitation\r\nabout which there can be no difference of opinion, the writer has,\r\nin following the lead of Owen and Robert Peter, endeavored to settle\r\ndefinitely _the natural limit of the action of a suitable acid upon\r\nsoils, and the time and strength of acid producing the maximum effect_.\r\n\r\n_Loughridge’s Investigation._—Systematic work on these points was\r\nundertaken, at his suggestion, by Dr. R. H. Loughridge in 1871 and\r\n1872. The results of this work were published in the succeeding year\r\nin the Amer. Journal of Science, and in the proceedings of the A. A.\r\nA. S. for 1873. They seem to be of sufficient general interest to be\r\nreproduced here.\r\n\r\nThe soil selected for this purpose was a very generalized one,\r\nrepresenting large areas in the states of Kentucky, Tennessee,\r\nMississippi and Louisiana, bordering on the east the immediate valley\r\nof the Mississippi river, and known locally as the “Table lands;” a\r\nnoted cotton-producing upland region. The brown or yellow, moderately\r\nclayey loam is of great uniformity throughout its region of occurrence,\r\nand is evidently derived from such widely-spread sources that it\r\nrepresents no special rock or complex of rocks. Its natural growth is\r\na mixture of oaks and hickories, strong and well-developed trees, such\r\nas any land-seeker would at once approve for settlement. Its cotton\r\nproduct when fresh was a 400-pound bale of cotton lint per acre. It may\r\ntherefore well be considered a typical generalized soil of the humid\r\nupland of the Mississippi valley. Its physical analysis is given in\r\nchapter 6, it being No. 219 of the table on p. 98.\r\n\r\n_Strength of Acid used._—Three different strengths of acid were\r\nsimultaneously employed, viz., chlorhydric of 1.10, 1.115 and 1.160\r\ndensity. With these the soil was digested at steam heat in porcelain\r\nbeakers covered with watch glasses for five days each, then evaporated\r\nand analyzed as usual. The results were as follows:\r\n\r\n          ANALYSIS WITH ACID OF DIFFERENT STRENGTHS.\r\n    =========================+=========================\r\n          Ingredients.       |     Sp.

The weakest acid had\r\na stronger solvent power; but the maximum effect was produced by the\r\nacid of 1.115 density. This being also the most readily obtainable, by\r\nsimple steam distillation of acid of any other strength, the writer\r\nadopted it as best suited to the purposes of soil analysis.\r\n\r\nTo ascertain the time required for the desired action, viz., the\r\nsolution of the plant-food ingredients to the extent likely to be of\r\nany avail to growing plants, digestions of the same soil were made in\r\nthe same manner for periods of 1, 3, 4, 5 and 10 days, with the acid of\r\n1.115 density.

Instead of repeating the ten-day\r\nexperiment, it was thought preferable to re-treat the residue from the\r\nfive-day digestion for five days more. The result was that only more\r\nsilica and alumina went into solution—in other words, additional clay\r\nwas alone being decomposed. This being of no interest in the matter of\r\nplant nutrition, the five-day period was definitely adopted by the\r\nwriter for his work; and it, together with the acid of 1.115 density,\r\nis the basis of all the results given in this volume, except where\r\notherwise stated. There appeared to him to be no good reason for the\r\nacceptance of the arbitrary method of soil-extraction suggested by\r\nKedzie and since adopted by the Association of Official Agricultural\r\nChemists; the more as to do so would throw out of comparison all the\r\nprevious work done by Owen, Peter, and himself and his pupils, which\r\nhad already been definitely correlated with the natural conditions and\r\nwith cultural experience.[117]\r\n\r\n[117] While regretting to thus “secede” from the fellowship of his\r\ncolleagues, the writer cannot but regret equally their voluntary\r\ndecision to do over again, or lightly reject, all that had been\r\ndone before in correlating soil-composition and plant-growth. He\r\nstill thinks that it is idle to expect any unification, national or\r\ninternational, of methods of soil analysis based upon purely arbitrary\r\nprescriptions, unless previously shown to be definitely correlated with\r\nnatural and cultural conditions; as is measurably the case with Dyer’s\r\nmethod.\r\n\r\n_Virgin Soils with High Plant-food Percentages are Always\r\nProductive._—In strong contrast to the contradictory evidence deduced\r\nfrom the analysis, by any method, of cultivated soils when compared\r\nwith cultural experience, it seems to be generally true that _virgin\r\nsoils showing high percentages of plant-food as ascertained by\r\nextraction with strong acids_ (such as hydrochloric, nitric, etc.),\r\n_invariably prove highly productive_: provided only that extreme\r\nphysical characters do not interfere with normal plant growth, as is\r\nsometimes the case with heavy clays, or very coarse sandy lands.—_To\r\nthis rule no exception has thus far been found._ The composition of\r\nsome representative soils falling within this category is given in\r\nthe annexed table, which at the same time conveys some idea of the\r\nproportion of acid-soluble ingredients usually found in the best class\r\nof natural soils.\r\n\r\n           TABLE EXEMPLIFYING HIGH PLANT-FOOD PERCENTAGE IN SOILS.\r\n\r\n     (A) = Buckshot soil.

Yet if all these were in\r\navailable form, the supply would be abundant for many hundreds and even\r\nthousands of crop years. For, one-tenth of one per cent in the case\r\nof the clayey soils of the preceding table would amount to about 3500\r\npounds per acre-foot, and to 4000 in the case of the sandy ones. Hence\r\nthe amount of phosphoric acid in _e. g._, the Mississippi delta soil\r\nfrom Houma would suffice for the production of about 440 crops of wheat\r\ngrain (at 20 bushels per acre) if only one foot depth were drawn upon;\r\nbut as the roots of grain easily penetrate to twice and half and three\r\ntimes that depth even in the humid region, the number might be tripled.\r\nAs a matter of fact, however, that soil has produced full crops for\r\nfrom forty to fifty years only; yet this is considered an exceptionally\r\nlong duration of profitable production without fertilization.\r\n\r\n    The first and last soils in the above list represent\r\n    probably the highest types of productiveness known. The\r\n    Yazoo bottom soil has produced up to one thousand pounds of\r\n    cotton lint per acre when fresh, and is still producing from\r\n    four to five hundred pounds after thirty years’ culture.\r\n    The Arroyo Grande soil of California with its extraordinary\r\n    percentages of phosphoric acid and nitrogen, as well as\r\n    exceptionally high proportion of available phosphoric acid\r\n    and potash, has made such a record of productiveness, and\r\n    high quality of the seeds produced, that it has for a\r\n    number of years been excluded from competition for prizes\r\n    offered by seed-producers elsewhere, in order to give other\r\n    sections a chance. Both these soils are rather heavy clays,\r\n    but readily tillable in consequence of their abundant\r\n    lime-content. The remarkably high content of acid-soluble\r\n    silica, indicating the presence of much easily available\r\n    zeolitic matter, is doubtless connected with the exceptional\r\n    productiveness.\r\n\r\nExperience, then, proves that lands showing such high plant-food\r\npercentages will yield profitable harvests for a long time without\r\nfertilization, or with only such partial returns as are afforded by\r\nthe offal of crops. Also that when fertilization comes to be required,\r\ninstead of supplying _all_ the ingredients usually constituting\r\nfertilizers, only one or two of these will as a rule be actually\r\nneeded, and even these in smaller amounts than in “poor” lands; thus\r\nmaterially reducing the expense of fertilization. The high production\r\nand durability of such lands therefore amply justify their higher\r\npecuniary valuation; for which there would be no rational permanent\r\nground if they required fertilization to the same extent as poor lands.\r\nIn other words, if the entire amount of soil-ingredients removed by\r\ncrops had had to be currently replaced equally in _all_ cases (as\r\nis implied in the hypothesis, advanced by some, that the chemical\r\ncomposition of soils is of no practical consequence), the high prices\r\nwhich from time immemorial have been paid for black prairie and rich\r\nalluvial lands as against meagre uplands and barrens, would have been\r\nso much money wasted.\r\n\r\nThe explanation of these advantages evidently lies largely in the\r\nlarger amounts of soil ingredients annually rendered available in\r\nrich soils by the fallowing effect of the atmospheric agencies,\r\nbecause of the generous totals present. The actual _amounts_ of soil\r\ningredients thus rendered accessible to plants, other things being\r\nequal, are evidently more or less directly _proportional to the totals\r\nof acid-soluble plant-food ingredients present_. And if this is true\r\nin cultivated lands, the inevitable conclusion is that the same must\r\nbe true of virgin lands; _whose productive capacity and duration can\r\ntherefore be forecast by such analyses_. It will be observed that the\r\nabove data, which could be indefinitely increased by corroborative\r\nanalyses, seem to establish the fact that about one per cent of\r\nacid-soluble potash, one of lime, the same, or less, of magnesia, and\r\n.15% of phosphoric acid, are thus shown to be “high” percentages of\r\nthese ingredients in virgin soils.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to see how the above conclusions can be successfully\r\ncontroverted; they are, moreover, thoroughly in accordance with\r\ncultural experience. Difficulties of interpretation arise mainly in\r\nthe case of medium soils, which show neither very high nor very low\r\npercentages of plant-food; and which raise the question of what amount\r\nor percentage constitutes “adequacy” of each of the several substances.\r\n\r\n_Low Percentages._—On the other hand, whenever in virgin soils\r\nacid-analysis shows the presence of but a _very_ small proportion\r\nof one or several of the essential ingredients, we have a valuable\r\nindication as to the one of these that will first be required to be\r\nadded when production slackens.\r\n\r\n_What are “Adequate” Percentages of Potash, Lime, Phosphoric Acid and\r\nNitrogen?_—It is evident that a very critical discussion of cultural\r\nexperience can alone answer this question; and at first sight such\r\nexperience often appears very contradictory when compared with the\r\nresults of analysis.\r\n\r\n    One of the chief causes of such apparent discrepancies is\r\n    readily intelligible when we consider the differences in\r\n    root-development of the same plant in different soils. In\r\n    “light” or sandy lands the roots may penetrate to several\r\n    times the depth attained by them in heavy clay soils. Having\r\n    thus within their reach a soil-mass several times larger,\r\n    and aerated to a much greater depth, it is but reasonable\r\n    to expect that in deep, sandy lands plants would do equally\r\n    well with correspondingly smaller percentages of plant-food\r\n    than would suffice in clay soils, in which the root-range\r\n    is very much more restricted. The well-known fact that the\r\n    production of heavy clay lands may be increased by their\r\n    intermixture with mere sand, adding nothing to their store\r\n    of plant-food, emphasizes this expectation and elevates it\r\n    into a maxim. On this ground alone, therefore, it is evident\r\n    that the mere consideration of plant-food _percentages_\r\n    found, can be a true measure of productiveness only in the\r\n    case of virgin soils with _high_ percentages.\r\n\r\n_Soil Dilution Experiments._—The extent to which dilution with mere\r\n“lightening” materials can be carried without impairing production,\r\ncan of course be determined for concrete cases only; but the following\r\nexperiment made at the California Station is a case in point:\r\n\r\nOne kilogram of the heavy but highly productive black clay soil of\r\nthe experimental grounds of the University of California was used\r\nin each of five experimental cultures, each made in duplicate, in\r\ncylindrical vessels of zinc-covered (“galvanized”) sheet iron, all\r\nproportioned alike in height and diameter, but containing respectively\r\none, two, four, five and six volumes of total soil. In the smallest\r\nwas placed one kilogram of the undiluted, original soil, in the others\r\nsuccessively the same amount of the soil thoroughly mixed with one,\r\nthree, four, and five volumes of a dune sand fully extracted with\r\nchlorhydric acid, and washed with distilled water. The water capacity\r\nof each of the mixtures was determined and the earth in the pots kept\r\nat the point of half-saturation generally admitted to be the optimum\r\n(best condition) for plant growth. Each pot was sown with ten seeds of\r\nwhite mustard, subsequently reduced to five plants selected for their\r\nvigor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 53.—Natural Adobe Clay Soil.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 54.—Adobe Soil diluted with sand, 1 to 1.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 55.—Same, diluted 1 to 3.\r\n\r\nDEVELOPMENT OF ROOTS OF WHITE MUSTARD IN CLAY SOIL, DILUTED WITH\r\nVARIOUS PROPORTIONS OF PURE SAND.]\r\n\r\nThe (“galvanized”) vegetation pots were made as nearly as possible of\r\nsimilar proportions in depth and width for each dilution, so as to give\r\nopportunity for the proportional development of the root systems.

A marked\r\n    change in these respects is manifest in the first dilution,\r\n    and increasingly so as dilution increases; the paucity of\r\n    root-hairs is very marked in the last (greatest) dilution,\r\n    in which, as the photograph of the plants shows, the\r\n    development was decidedly behind that in the pot containing\r\n    dilution 1:4. The latter in fact showed the best development\r\n    not only in this case, but in two other series of tests\r\n    conducted at the same and subsequent times; and strangely\r\n    enough, also in the pulverulent, “sandy loam” soil of the\r\n    southern California substation tract. In the latter series,\r\n    which for lack of space cannot be figured here, the main\r\n    difference was that in the undiluted soil the roots filled\r\n    the entire soil mass, instead of remaining near the surface,\r\n    as in the pure adobe. It is possible that the latter was\r\n    too wet when given the full half of its water-capacity,\r\n    although, as the figures show, the water was slowly\r\n    introduced from below by means of glass tubes, ending within\r\n    a shield to prevent puddling.\r\n\r\n_Limitation of Root Action._—These results, representing five soils of\r\ndifferent percentage-composition and physical character, but identical\r\nchemical composition and ratios between the several ingredients,\r\nand similarly acted upon by the atmospheric agencies in the past,\r\nillustrate strikingly the impossibility of judging correctly of a\r\nsoil’s productiveness from _percentages_ of chemical ingredients\r\nalone. It is clear that the physical characters of the land as well\r\nas its depth, must be essentially taken into account. But there is\r\nobviously a certain limit beyond which greater perviousness and\r\nroot-penetration cannot make up for deficiency in the absolute amounts\r\nof plant-food within possible reach of the plant; for in the case of\r\nexcessive dilution these are rendered partially inaccessible within the\r\ntime-limits of a season’s growth.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to say that these experiments require repetition\r\nwith the aid of the experience acquired in these first trials, not\r\nonly in the laboratory but also in the field. It will be especially\r\ninteresting to compare with the results obtained in these strongly\r\ncalcareous soils, the effects of dilution in such soils as those\r\nof Florida, mentioned below; the probability being that where lime\r\nis naturally deficient, the effects of dilution will be much more\r\npronounced in diminishing production, because of the absence of\r\nthe previous favorable action of lime upon the availability of the\r\nsoil-ingredients.\r\n\r\n_Lowest Limit of Plant-food Percentages and Productiveness found\r\nin Virgin Soils._—The subjoined table shows some of the very low\r\nplant-food percentages found in natural soils, all being of a sandy\r\ncharacter:\r\n\r\n    ============================+====================================\r\n                                |         MISSISSIPPI SOILS.\r\n                                +----------+--------+--------+-------\r\n                                |Homochitto| Shell  |  Pine  | Pine\r\n                                | Bottom.  |Hammock.| Woods. |Flats.\r\n    ----------------------------+----------+--------+--------+-------\r\n          Number of Sample.     |    68    |   83   |  206   |  214\r\n    ----------------------------+----------+--------+--------+-------\r\n    CHEMICAL ANALYSIS OF        |          |        |        |\r\n        FINE EARTH.             |          |        |        |\r\n    ----------------------------+----------+--------+--------+------\r\n    Insoluble matter            |          |        |        |\r\n                                |   92.16  |  96.08 |  93.23 | 95.59\r\n    Soluble silica              |          |        |        |\r\n    ----------------------------+----------+--------+--------+------\r\n    Potash (K₂O)                |     .15  |    .05 |    .26 |   .06\r\n    Soda (Na₂O)                 |     .04  |    .06 |    .07 |   .05\r\n    Lime (CaO)                  |     .12  |    .10 |    .12 |   .02\r\n    Magnesia (MgO)              |     .21  |    .12 |    .18 |   .07\r\n    Br. ox. of Manganese (Mn₃O₄)|     .28  |    .05 |    .15 |   .05\r\n    Peroxid of Iron (Fe₂O₃)     |    1.18  |    .52 |   1.25 |   .46\r\n    Alumina (Al₂O₃)             |    3.22  |    .46 |   2.36 |   .85\r\n    Phosphoric acid (P₂O₅)      |     .08  |    .10 |    .03 |   .02\r\n    Sulfuric acid (SO₃)         |     .05  | Trace  |    .02 | Trace\r\n    Carbonic acid (CO₂)         |          |        |        |\r\n    Water and organic matter    |    2.70  |   3.02 |   2.33 |  2.28\r\n                                +----------+--------+--------+--------\r\n          Total                 |  100.19  | 100.56 | 100.00 | 99.45\r\n    ----------------------------+----------+--------+--------+--------\r\n\r\n    ============================+====================\r\n                                |   FLORIDA SOILS.\r\n                                +--------------------\r\n                                |    Pine Lands.\r\n                                |-------+------------\r\n                                | First |   Second\r\n                                |Class. |   Class.\r\n    ----------------------------+-------+------------\r\n          Number of Sample.     |   6   |     7\r\n    ----------------------------+-------+------------\r\n    CHEMICAL ANALYSIS OF        |       |\r\n        FINE EARTH.             |       |\r\n    ----------------------------+-------+------------\r\n    Insoluble matter            | 94.46 | 95.63\r\n                                |       |       96.51\r\n    Soluble silica              |  1.67 |   .88\r\n    ----------------------------+-------+------------\r\n    Potash (K₂O)                |   .19 |   .12\r\n    Soda (Na₂O)                 |   .04 |   .06\r\n    Lime (CaO)                  |   .07 |   .06\r\n    Magnesia (MgO)              |   .04 |   .04\r\n    Br. ox. of Manganese (Mn₃O₄)|   .06 |   .05\r\n    Peroxid of Iron (Fe₂O₃)     |   .32 |   .22\r\n    Alumina (Al₂O₃)             |   .92 |   .47\r\n    Phosphoric acid (P₂O₅)      |   .11 |   .09\r\n    Sulfuric acid (SO₃)         |   .09 |   .06\r\n    Carbonic acid (CO₂)         |       |\r\n    Water and organic matter    |  1.88 |  1.81\r\n                                +-------+------------\r\n          Total                 | 99.85 | 99.49\r\n    ----------------------------+-------+------------\r\n\r\nThe average of plant-food percentages in all these soils is quite\r\nlow, and at first sight there seems to be little choice between them.\r\nYet two of them—Nos. 68 and 88, from Mississippi—are not only quite\r\nproductive at the outset, but also fairly durable. This becomes\r\nmeasurably intelligible when it is known that both are of great depth,\r\nand so well drained that roots can descend for many feet; while the\r\ncomposition of the soil-material is almost identical for three or four\r\nfeet. On the other hand, both Nos. 206 and 214 are quite shallow,\r\nbeing underlaid by sand almost devoid of plant-food at about two feet.\r\nIn addition, both have extremely low percentages of phosphoric acid;\r\nwhile the rest show near .10% of that ingredient, an amount which, as\r\nwill be seen hereafter, is considerably above the recognized limit\r\nof deficiency. The two Florida soils however bear only pine; they are\r\nunderlaid by almost clean sand at two or three feet, and are therefore\r\nquickly exhausted. It will also be noted that their lime-percentage is\r\nonly about half of that of the two first-named Mississippi soils, both\r\nof which bear a strong growth of deciduous timber trees, grape vines,\r\nand other vegetation indicating the presence of lime carbonate.\r\n\r\nIt is noteworthy, also, that the popular classification of the\r\ntwo Florida soils corresponds exactly with the differences in the\r\npercentages of plant-food; those in the “second-class” soil being\r\nuniformly lower than those in the one designated as first-class. This\r\nindicates, again, that _as between soils of similar character and\r\norigin, the production and durability are sensibly proportional to the\r\nplant-food percentages_ when the latter fall below a certain limit; a\r\npoint more fully illustrated farther on.\r\n\r\nIn the light of the above experiment and tables, it becomes pertinent\r\nto consider what _are_ the lowest percentage limits of each of the more\r\nimportant plant-food ingredients compatible with profitable production.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIMITS OF ADEQUACY OF THE SEVERAL PLANT-FOODS IN VIRGIN SOILS.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that the lower limits of adequacy of the critical\r\nplant-food ingredients are best ascertained in the case of virgin soils\r\ncontaining very small amounts of some _one_ ingredient, while fairly\r\nor fully supplied with the rest. In such cases, which are not at all\r\ninfrequent, the use of the deficient ingredient as a fertilizer should\r\nproduce a very marked effect so soon as the first flush of production\r\n(always noted in fresh soil) is over. This first productiveness may,\r\neven in poor lands, range from one to three years, when there is a\r\nsudden decline.\r\n\r\n_Lime a Dominant Factor._—When we investigate the cases of such lands,\r\nit soon becomes apparent that besides the low percentage of any one\r\ningredient, the _proportions_ of others present require consideration.\r\nAmong these, _lime_ in the form of carbonate stands foremost. Its\r\npresence exerts a dominant and beneficial influence in many respects,\r\nas is readily apparent from the prompt change in vegetation whenever it\r\nis introduced into soils deficient in it. In discussing the results of\r\nsoil analysis, its consideration is of first importance in forecasting\r\ncorrectly the adequacy or inadequacy of other soil ingredients (see\r\nchapter 20, page 379). For in general, we find that _lower percentages\r\nof potash, phosphoric acid and nitrogen are adequate, when a large\r\nproportion of lime carbonate is present_.—This has already been\r\nreferred to in connection with the table of soils of low percentages,\r\ngiven above. In the interpretation of results obtained by analysis this\r\npoint must always be kept in view; and in the numerical statements\r\nmade below, it must be understood that they refer to virgin soils\r\nsufficiently supplied with lime to assure a constant excess of lime\r\ncarbonate, maintaining the conditions of nitrification and insuring the\r\nabsence of acidity. (See chapter 9, page 146).\r\n\r\n_Potash._—In respect to potash, the writer was led by his early\r\ninvestigations in the State of Mississippi to conclude that less than\r\none-fourth of one per cent (.25) of potash constituted a deficiency\r\nlikely to call for early fertilization with potash salts; while as much\r\nas .45% of the same seemed to cause the land to respond but feebly to\r\nsuch fertilization. He has not found it necessary to revise materially\r\nthat early conclusion, whether from his own work or from that of\r\nothers. Within the last decade, Prof. Liebscher of Göttingen[119] has\r\narrived at this identical figure from analyses made of soils upon which\r\nhe had conducted a seven-year series of fertilizer tests; he having\r\nfound that potash fertilization produced no sensible, or at least no\r\npaying results on land giving that figure, and otherwise well provided\r\nwith plant-food. The different (lower) figures given by Schloesing,\r\nRisler and other French chemists in discussing the soils of France are\r\ndoubtless due to the weak acid and short period of digestion employed\r\nin the analysis; an unfortunate discrepancy of methods which precludes\r\nany direct comparison of results.\r\n\r\n[119] Untersuchungen über die Bestimmung des Düngerbedürfnisses\r\nder Ackerböden und Kulturpflanzen, von G. Liebscher; Journal für\r\nLandwirtschaft 43 (1895), Nos. 1 & 2, pp. 48-216.\r\n\r\n    These figures apply both to the arid and the humid regions\r\n    in the temperate zones. In the tropics we find very much\r\n    lower percentages quoted as adequate; thus in the laterite\r\n    soils of India and Samoa, according to Wohltmann, in the\r\n    soils of Jamaica according to Fawcett, and in those of\r\n    Madagascar according to Müntz and Rousseaux.[120] There,\r\n    potash-percentages over .10% seem to be high, and in\r\n    Madagascar some lands in fair production range as low as\r\n    .01%. The soil-extractions have however in these cases been\r\n    made with a weaker acid than above specified, so that some\r\n    increase of the figures (perhaps 33 to 50%) have to be\r\n    allowed for. But even then there can be no question that a\r\n    far less amount of potash, as determined by acid-extraction,\r\n    is found sufficient for crop production in the tropics;\r\n    doubtless because of the very intense decomposing\r\n    (“fallowing”) effect of the continuous heat and moisture,\r\n    tending also to a rapid decomposition of organic matter and\r\n    a proportionally rapid formation of carbonic and nitric\r\n    acids. Such soils are of course constantly kept in a leached\r\n    condition, as a result of the heavy and continuous rainfall.\r\n\r\n[120] _La Valeur Agricole des Terres de Madagascar._ Ann. de la Science\r\nAgronomique, 2’me série, tome 1, 1901.\r\n\r\n_Phosphoric Acid._—As regards the lower limit of adequacy of phosphoric\r\nacid, there is a remarkable agreement in the investigations made\r\neverywhere. It was placed at .05% by the writer as long ago as 1860,\r\nas the result of investigations made in the State of Mississippi; and\r\nthe same figure has since been arrived at independently by agricultural\r\nchemists in France, Russia, Germany and England. The cause of this\r\nremarkable agreement is undoubtedly the readiness with which the\r\nphosphates that come under consideration at all for the nutrition\r\nof plants, are dissolved by almost any acid treatment likely to be\r\nused in soil analysis. Almost the same agreement exists in regard to\r\nthe “adequacy” of .1% of P₂O₅; while all soils showing percentages\r\nbetween .1 and .05% are considered weak on this side, and liable to\r\nneed phosphate fertilization soon. One-fourth of one per cent is\r\nan unusually high percentage in most countries; .30% and over is\r\nexceptional in non-ferruginous soils. But as stated on a previous page,\r\na high percentage of lime carbonate may offset a smaller percentage of\r\nphosphoric acid, apparently by bringing about greater availability; and\r\na similar effect seems to result from the presence of a large supply of\r\nhumus.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, very large percentages of finely divided ferric\r\nhydrate may, especially in the absence of lime carbonate, render even\r\nlarge supplies of phosphoric acid inert and useless, by the formation\r\nof the totally insoluble ferric phosphate. Aluminic hydrate probably\r\nacts in a similar manner. The following table gives examples in point,\r\nas regards ferric hydrate.\r\n\r\n       HAWAIIAN SOILS SHOWING HIGH CONTENTS OF FERRIC OXID.\r\n               (Rept. Cal. Exp.

In the much less\r\n    ferruginous Hawaiian soils, though containing more alumina,\r\n    the citric acid extracted nearly ten times as much; proving\r\n    that it is chiefly ferric oxid, and not the alumina as has\r\n    been supposed, that causes the insolubility of phosphoric\r\n    acid in soils and doubtless also in fertilizers. The\r\n    very unusually high content of phosphoric acid in the\r\n    Hawaiian soils, exceeding all others on record, so far\r\n    as known to the writer, emphasize the effects of ferric\r\n    hydrate upon soluble phosphates; while the fact that these\r\n    very soils are greatly benefited by the use of phosphate\r\n    fertilizers, proves that the Dyer (citric acid) method for\r\n    the determination of available phosphoric acid which in\r\n    soils Nos. 21 to 26 yielded results largely in excess of the\r\n    established limit in European soils, cannot be successfully\r\n    applied to these highly ferruginous soils. It should also\r\n    be noted that the amounts of phosphoric acid found in the\r\n    humus extracted by the Grandeau method is in the first\r\n    two Hawaiian soils over ten times the amount extracted by\r\n    citric acid, but that while they rise and fall together, no\r\n    definite quantitative ratio exists between the two.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that in such soils, fertilization with water-soluble\r\nphosphates would be likely to result in the quick partial withdrawal of\r\nthe same from useful action, and that any excess not promptly taken up\r\nby the crop, is likely to become inert and useless. It will evidently\r\nbe desirable to use the phosphates in the form of bone meal or basic\r\nslag (Thomas Phosphate), which because of their difficult solubility\r\nwill be acted upon but very slowly, if at all, by the ferric and\r\naluminic hydrates.\r\n\r\n_Nitrogen._—In determining the nitrogen-content of the soil, a great\r\nvariety of methods has been followed. Some include all that can be\r\nobtained by the combustion of the organic matters of soil and from\r\nthe nitrates present in the same; while others, the writer among the\r\nnumber, believe that the mainly important source of nitrogen to the\r\nplant being the nitrification of the humus-nitrogen, the determination\r\nof the humus by the method of Grandeau, and of the nitrogen contained\r\nin it, should be the standard; the unhumified vegetable matter being of\r\nno definitely ascertainable value, and the nitrates varying from day\r\nto day and being liable to be lost by leaching at any time; therefore\r\nforming no permanent feature of the soil. Considering the variety of\r\nmethods, the unanimity with which about one-tenth of one per cent (.10)\r\nhas been assumed as the ordinarily adequate percentage is remarkable.\r\nIn view of the extremely variable amount of nitrogen in the humus\r\n(ranging from 1.7 to nearly 22%), the amount of the latter cannot,\r\nof course, afford even an approximation to the nitrogen-content;\r\nexcept that as in the humid region, the nitrogen-percentage is not\r\nknown to exceed about 5 or 5.5%, an approximate estimate can be\r\nmade on that basis. In the arid region, according to location, the\r\nnitrogen-percentage may be from three to six times greater for a\r\nsimilar amount of humus. (See chap. 8. p. 135). In the writer’s\r\nexperience, a nitrogen-percentage of .1% in the arid region is a very\r\nsatisfactory figure, indicating that the need of nitrogen-fertilization\r\nis not likely to arise for a number of years.\r\n\r\n_Nitrification of the Organic Matter of the Soil._—In order to test the\r\nquestion whether or not the nitrogen of the unhumified debris existing\r\nin surface soils is directly nitrifiable, the writer selected a soil\r\nwhich in its natural condition sustains intense nitrification, so that\r\nat some points it contains as much as 1200 pounds of sodic nitrate\r\nper acre. The composition of this soil, representing the land of the\r\n“ten-acre tract” of the southern California substation, is as follows:\r\n\r\n          SOIL FROM “TEN-ACRE TRACT,”\r\n      SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SUB-STATION, NO. 1284.\r\n\r\n    Coarse Materials > 0.55ᵐᵐ              1.00\r\n    Fine Earth                            99.00\r\n                                         ------\r\n                                         100.00\r\n    CHEMICAL ANALYSIS OF FINE EARTH.\r\n\r\n    Insoluble matter                      62.62} 70.92\r\n    Soluble silica                         8.30}\r\n    Potash (K₂O)                            .95\r\n    Soda (Na₂O)                             .50\r\n    Lime (CaO)                             5.07\r\n    Magnesia (MgO)                          .84\r\n    Br. ox. of Manganese (Mn₂O₄)            .06\r\n    Peroxid of Iron (Fe₂O₃)                6.43\r\n    Alumina (Al₂O₃)                        3.88\r\n    Phosphoric acid (P₂O₅)                  .21\r\n    Sulfuric acid (SO₃)                     .06\r\n    Carbonic acid (CO₂)                    3.66\r\n    Water and organic matter               6.02\r\n                                          -----\r\n    Total                                 99.70\r\n\r\n    Water-soluble matter, per cent.         .137\r\n    Sodic nitrate, per cent.                .020\r\n\r\n    Humus                                  1.99\r\n      “ Ash                                 1.13\r\n      “ Nitrogen, per cent. in Humus        10.30\r\n      “    “ , per cent. in soil            .203\r\n    Total Nitrogen in soil                  .330\r\n      “      “  in unhumified matter        .127\r\n    Available Potash            {citric}    .03\r\n    Available Phosphoric acid   {method}\r\n    Hygroscopic Moisture\r\n        absorbed at 15° C.                 5.81\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that this is a rather strongly calcareous soil,\r\n(nearly 9% of calcic carbonate), slightly impregnated with alkali,\r\nof which about one-ninth is saltpeter. One portion of this soil was\r\nthoroughly leached with distilled water until not a trace of nitrates\r\ncould be detected in the leachings. Another portion was treated for the\r\nremoval of humus according to the Grandeau method (see chapter 8, page\r\n132); the extracted soil showed under the microscope an abundance of\r\nvegetable debris, some slightly browned as from incipient humification.\r\n\r\nThe calcic and magnesic carbonates withdrawn in the humus-extraction\r\nwere then restored to the soil in the form of finely divided\r\nprecipitates and thoroughly mixed in, first in the dry and then in the\r\nwet condition; the extracted soil being repeatedly wetted with turbid\r\nwater from the leached soil, in order to replace and reinfect it with\r\nthe nitrifying bacteria. Both soils were then spread out in flat glass\r\ndishes and placed in a wooden box containing also a similar flat dish\r\nwith distilled water, upon which played the draught from the inlet\r\npipe opening into the outer air, with outlet-holes in the cover at the\r\nopposite end; thus keeping the air within fairly moist. In addition,\r\nthe soils themselves were moistened with distilled water every three\r\ndays and restored to a loose condition by stirring. The whole was\r\nplaced so as to maintain, during the greater part of the 24 hours, a\r\ntemperature of from 30 to 35 degrees C. At intervals the samples of\r\nboth soils were leached and color-titrated for their nitrate content by\r\nthe picric-acid test. The results, calculated as sodic nitrate, during\r\ntwo years were as follows:\r\n\r\n    =====================+============+==============+==========\r\n    Nitrate formed during|Four months.|Twelve months.|Two years.\r\n    ---------------------+------------+--------------+----------\r\n    Leached natural soil |    .012    |    .0420     |   .061\r\n    Extracted soil       |    None.   |    .0030     |   .0042\r\n    ---------------------+------------+--------------+----------\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that in the course of four months, nitrification had\r\nnot sensibly set in the extracted soil; while in the leached natural\r\nsoil the nitrate-content had reached to three-fifths the amount\r\noriginally present, and in the course of a year the nitrate-content\r\nof the latter was more than double that of the original (unleached)\r\nsoil; while that in the extracted soil had only reached one-seventh\r\nof the same. At the end of two years we find a still farther increase\r\nof nitric nitrogen in both, the ratio between the two remaining about\r\nthe same (1:14). At the same time the ratio of increase attained at\r\nfirst had materially diminished in the water-leached soil, probably on\r\naccount of the accumulation of the niter itself.\r\n\r\nIt thus appears that although the nitrogen of the unhumified organic\r\nmatter constituted about 40% of the total in the original soil, it\r\nwould during the entire year have contributed only to an insignificant\r\nextent to the available nitrate-supply; while the fully humified\r\n“matière noire” contributed fourteen times as much. During the ordinary\r\ngrowing-season of four or five months the unhumified organic matter\r\nwould have yielded practically nothing to the crop.\r\n\r\n_Functions of the unhumified Vegetable Matter._—The chief utility\r\nof the unhumified matter in the soil consists of course in its\r\ngradual conversion into true humus, in the course of which it evolves\r\ncarbonic gas to act on the soil minerals; while at the same time\r\nit helps to render the soil more porous and thus facilitates the\r\naction of the aerobic bacteria, for which it serves as food. Hence\r\nthe addition of vegetable matter to soils not already too “light”\r\nis always advantageous, so long as it does not introduce injurious,\r\nnon-humifiable ingredients, like turpentine in the sawdust of resinous\r\npines. But it is always advisable to first use such matter as litter\r\nfor stock, in order to better prepare it for the processes of\r\nhumification, under the influence of ammoniacal fermentation, such as\r\noccurs in the decay of green plants or animal matter. A portion of the\r\nash ingredients also is quickly utilized by solution in the soil-water.\r\n\r\n_Matière Noire the Only Guide._—According to these results it is\r\nclear that in order to gain any tangible indications with respect to\r\ncrop-bearing, it is the nitrogen in the humus proper, the _matière\r\nnoire_ only, that should serve as the basis; and that as a current\r\nsource of nitrogen to the plant, the unhumified matter is hardly\r\nentitled to more consideration than the “insoluble silicates.” For,\r\nthe favorable conditions for nitrification under which the above\r\nexperiment was conducted, will very rarely be even approached under\r\nfield conditions.\r\n\r\n_What are the Adequate Nitrogen Percentages in the Humus_?—The\r\nnitrification of the _matière noire_ being, apparently, the main source\r\nof plant-nutrition with that element under ordinary conditions, the\r\nquestion naturally arises as to what may be considered an adequate\r\nnitrogen-content of that substance, so as to permit a full supply of\r\nnitrates to the crop.\r\n\r\nThe data extant on this subject are rather scanty, and thus far\r\nhave all been obtained at the California Experiment Station.[121]\r\nBut they seem to be very cogent in proving that the growth of crops\r\nremoved from the soil causes a rapid depletion of the nitrogen in the\r\nhumus-substance, and that _so soon as the nitrogen-percentage in the\r\nsame falls below a certain point, the soil becomes “nitrogen-hungry;”_\r\nso that the application of nitrogenous fertilizers is needed and is\r\nvery effective.

Nos. 1842 and 1841 represent the same\r\n    soil as 1679, upon which, however, ramie and ray grass had\r\n    respectively been growing, without fertilization, for about\r\n    ten years; showing that while the _humus-content of the\r\n    soil has increased, the nitrogen-content of the humus has\r\n    decreased_ in the case of ramie by 72.78%, in that of\r\n    the grass by 76.78%; reducing the land to figures commonly\r\n    found in the humid region. In the case of the ramie, the\r\n    partial return through the leaves has resulted in a higher\r\n    humus-content, together with higher nitrogen-percentage,\r\n    than in the case of the grass, which in the several cuttings\r\n    annually made, caused a greater depletion in nitrogen and a\r\n    smaller accession of humus. The grass was very weak in its\r\n    growth and partially dying out.\r\n\r\n    No. 29, the sugar-cane land from Maui, was still in fair\r\n    production, but beginning to weaken as against its first\r\n    production. No. 27, the guava land from Hawaii, originally\r\n    bore a luxuriant cover of wild guava, but after bearing one\r\n    fair crop of seed-cane and one of ratoons, the cane planted\r\n    on it “spindled up” and died so soon as the seed-cane\r\n    planted was exhausted. Both the island soils, originally\r\n    derived from the weathering of the black basaltic lavas\r\n    of the region, were well supplied with mineral plant-food\r\n    (see above, page 356), and the humus-content in both was\r\n    exceptionally high; and neither was in an acid condition.\r\n    The difference in their nitrogen-content, both in the totals\r\n    and in the humus itself, suggested that notwithstanding\r\n    the relatively high total of nitrogen in No. 27, it might\r\n    be nitrogen-hungry, in view of the low percentage of the\r\n    nitrogen in the humus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 59.—Growth of Wheat on Guava Soil from Hawaii\r\nIsland.]\r\n\r\n_Confirmatory Experiment._—A pot-culture with wheat, the results of\r\nwhich are shown in the figure below, fully confirm this suspicion. One\r\nkilogram of soil was used in each of two pots, one being fertilized\r\nwith half a gram of Chile saltpeter. The experiment could not be\r\ncarried to full completion on account of the overwhelming invasion\r\nof mildew; but the figures speak for themselves. Moreover, a field\r\ntrial made on the island with saltpeter, in pursuance of the writer’s\r\nrecommendation, resulted in a luxuriant growth of the cane.\r\n\r\n_Data for Nitrogen-adequacy._—It appears from the facts shown above,\r\nthat for the growth of grasses a nitrogen-percentage in the humus of\r\n1.7 is wholly inadequate, no matter how much humus may be present. A\r\npercentage of 3.15 in the Maui soil, No. 29, containing nearly 11%\r\nof humus, gave only a fair crop of sugar-cane; on the Berkeley grass\r\nplot, with 3.40% and only 1.65 of total humus, the ray grass was barely\r\nmaintaining life. The ramie, with 4.17% of nitrogen in the soil-humus,\r\nwas still doing fairly well.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtless impossible to give one and the same absolute figure for\r\nnitrogen-deficiency for all plants and soils. Where the conditions of\r\nnitrification are favorable, as in the presence of much of the earth\r\ncarbonates, a smaller percentage may suffice for the same plants that\r\nelsewhere suffer; and it is highly probable that different minima will\r\nbe found for plants of different relationship and root-habits. But\r\nthere is every reason to believe that _in the nitrogen-percentage of\r\nsoil-humus, considered in connection with other chemical and physical\r\nconditions and soil derivations_, we have a means of ascertaining the\r\nneeds of plants with respect to nitrogen-fertilization, if proper study\r\nbe given to the subject. Broadly speaking, it appears to be necessary\r\n_to keep the nitrogen-percentage of soil-humus near 4% to insure\r\nsatisfactory production_.\r\n\r\nIt having been suggested that the frequent and disastrous crop failures\r\non the noted tchernozem or black-earth soils of Russia might be due in\r\npart at least to nitrogen-depletion of the humus, the writer obtained\r\nthrough the courtesy of Prof. P. Kossovitch of St. Petersburg soil\r\nsamples from the center of the Black-earth region, both cultivated and\r\nuncultivated. These samples are in appearance exactly like some of the\r\ndark alluvial soils of Louisiana and California, and approach them very\r\nnearly in the essentials of composition, as will be seen from the table\r\nbelow:\r\n\r\n                            ANALYSES OF BLACK SOILS,\r\n     =============================+=================+====================\r\n                                  |   Tchernozem    |      Alluvial\r\n                                  |    (Russia.)    | Black clay lands.\r\n                                  +------+----------+---------+----------\r\n                                  |      |          |Louisiana|California\r\n                                  |      |          | No. 240.| No. 1167.\r\n                                  |Virgin|Cultivated+---------+----------\r\n                                  |      |          |Back-land|Black-land\r\n                                  |      |          |  Houma. |  Tulare.\r\n     -----------------------------+------+----------+---------+----------\r\n     CHEMICAL ANALYSIS OF         |      |          |         |\r\n          FINE EARTH.             |      |          |         |\r\n    (No coarse material in soils.)|      |          |         |\r\n                                  |      |          |         |\r\n     Insoluble matter             | 48.38|  55.09   |   35.48 |   62.43\r\n     Soluble silica               | 13.21|  12.28   |   20.76 |   16.99\r\n     Potash (K₂O)                 |   .72|    .52   |    1.03 |    1.09\r\n     Soda (Na₂O)                  |   .20|    .13   |     .13 |     .77\r\n     Lime (CaO)                   |  1.51|   1.31   |     .72 |    1.46\r\n     Magnesia (MgO)               |   .73|    .75   |     .88 |    1.44\r\n     Br. ox. of Manganese (Mn₃O₄) |   .05|    .03   |     .01 |     .06\r\n     Peroxid of Iron (Fe₂O₃)      |  7.12|   4.80   |    7.10 |    4.98\r\n     Alumina (Al₂O₃)              |  5.22|   4.73   |   15.45 |    6.87\r\n     Phosphoric acid (P₂O₅)       |   .14|    .13   |     .15 |     .12\r\n     Sulfuric acid (SO₂)          |   .07|    .08   |     .25 |     .02\r\n     Carbonic acid (CO₂)          |      |          |         |\r\n     Water and organic matter     | 22.78|  19.94   |   18.52 |\r\n           Total                  |100.13|  99.79   |  100.48 |  100.59\r\n                                  |      |          |         |\r\n     Humus                        |  5.11|   5.54   |    5.07 |    1.33\r\n       “   Ash                    |  1.80|   1.40   |     .91 |     .36\r\n       “   Nitrogen, per cent.    |      |          |         |\r\n                       in Humus   |  4.63|   4.22   |         |\r\n       “      “      per cent.    |      |          |         |\r\n                        in soil   |   .27|    .24   |         |\r\n     Available Potash             |      |          |         |\r\n        (citric acid method)      |  .014|    .010  |         |\r\n     Available Phosph. acid       |  .011|    .008  |     .08 |     .01\r\n        (citric acid method)      |      |          |         |\r\n     Hygroscopic Moisture         |      |  12.07   |   18.82 |    5.38\r\n        absorbed at               |      |   17°C   |   13°C  |   15°C\r\n     -----------------------------+------+----------+---------+----------\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the Russian soil is of high fertility according\r\nto the standards given above, and that the nitrogen-content of the\r\nabundant humus is amply within the limits of adequacy suggested by the\r\nexperience in California and Hawaii. The humus-content of the arid\r\nCalifornia soils is characteristically low as compared with the Russian\r\ntchernozem as well as with the Houma backland of humid Louisiana; but\r\nits nitrogen-content is doubtless at least three times that of the\r\nlatter, as is that of the humus of similar lands in which it has been\r\ndetermined.\r\n\r\n\r\nINFLUENCE OF LIME UPON SOIL FERTILITY.\r\n\r\nAssuming as substantially correct the numerical data given above in\r\nrespect to the three leading ingredients of plant-food—phosphoric acid,\r\npotash and nitrogen,—the dominant role of lime in soil fertility,\r\nalready mentioned, requires some farther illustration and discussion.\r\n\r\n“_A Lime Country is a Rich Country._”—The instant change of vegetation\r\nwhen we pass from a non-calcareous region to one having calcareous\r\nsoils, has already been alluded to. (See this chapter, p. 354). But it\r\nis not necessary to be a botanist to see the change in the prosperity\r\nof the farming population as one enters a lime district. The single\r\nlog-cabin with, probably, a wooden barrel terminating the mud-plastered\r\nchimney, is replaced, first by double log-houses, then by frame, and\r\nfarther on by brick buildings, with the other unmistakable evidences of\r\nprosperity. Thus this is seen in passing from the mountain region of\r\nKentucky into the “blue-grass” country, which is throughout underlaid\r\nby calcareous formations; and thus, likewise, in crossing the strike\r\nof the formations of Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana, or any other\r\nregion where underlying calcareous formations have contributed to the\r\nformation of the soils, as compared with some adjacent district where\r\nthis is not the case. The calcareous loess areas bordering on the\r\nMississippi river and some of its chief tributaries, are conspicuous\r\ncases in point, as are also the prairies of Illinois and Indiana.\r\n\r\n_Effects of High Lime-content in Soils._—The table below illustrates\r\nthe fact that in the presence of high lime-percentages, relatively\r\nlow percentages of phosphoric acid and potash may nevertheless\r\nprove adequate; while the same, or even higher amounts, in the\r\nabsence of satisfactory lime-percentages prove insufficient for good\r\nproduction.[123]\r\n\r\n[123] This statement appears contradictory of the observations of\r\nSchloesing upon the solubility of phosphoric acid in presence of lime\r\ncarbonate (Am. Sci. Agron., tome 1, 1899), but the natural conditions\r\nseem to justify fully the above conclusion.\r\n\r\n                  SOILS SHOWING LOW PHOSPHORIC ACID PERCENTAGE.\r\n

----------------------------+---------+-------+-----------+---------\r\n\r\n    Nos. 139 and 171 are heavy black prairie soils of high\r\n    productive capacity, whose production had, at the time of\r\n    sampling, lasted almost undiminished for over twenty years.\r\n    Nearly the same is true of the two California soils, Nos.\r\n    499 and 1113; which, however, are ferruginous loams of only\r\n    moderate clay-content. In all, the percentage of phosphoric\r\n    acid shown by the analysis is at or below the recognized\r\n    limit of deficiency, while the lime-content of all is as\r\n    high as is required for the welfare of any soil, however\r\n    constituted. The potash-percentage also is low in all except\r\n    the “red foothill soil,” No. 1113.\r\n\r\n    Passing to the soils of low lime-content, we find the two\r\n    Mississippi soils, poor in both potash, lime and phosphoric\r\n    acid, so low in production as to be wholly unprofitable in\r\n    cultivation without previous fertilization; No. 559, from\r\n    California, produced two fair crops of barley and then no\r\n    more. No. 207, is the soil of Eel river bottom, California;\r\n    profusely productive at first, by virtue of its high content\r\n    of both potash and phosphoric acid; but “giving out” under a\r\n    few years’ culture of clover or alfalfa (which draw heavily\r\n    upon lime), and quickly restored to productiveness under the\r\n    influence of dressings of quicklime. In this case the soil\r\n    had become acid, a condition which always militates against\r\n    the success of culture plants, and more especially against\r\n    those of the leguminous relationship.\r\n\r\n_What are Adequate Lime Percentages?_—We have in the presence or\r\nabsence of the natural vegetation peculiar to calcareous soils\r\n(“calciphile”) an excellent index of the presence or absence of such\r\namounts of lime carbonate as fulfil the conditions of its beneficial\r\neffects. Lists of such plants for the United States are given farther\r\non; they agree almost throughout with such plants as are everywhere\r\nrecognized by American farmers as indicating productive soils.\r\n\r\nAll soils bearing such vegetation show with red litmus paper, when\r\nwetted, a neutral reaction at first, which after the lapse of twenty or\r\nthirty minutes turns to a blue alkaline one; such as is given under the\r\nsame conditions by the carbonates of lime and magnesia.\r\n\r\nBut the reverse is not necessarily true; for we occasionally find soils\r\ncontaining considerable amounts of lime carbonate that yet fail to bear\r\nlime vegetation. This is the case of extremely heavy clay soils, as\r\nexemplified in the table below in the case of the last three soils;\r\nwhile the first, No. 220, exemplifies a case where although potash is\r\nexceptionally high, only scrubby oak growth is produced in presence of\r\nan amount of lime that in sandy lands would show profuse lime growth.\r\n\r\n              TABLE ILLUSTRATING THE NEED OF HIGH LIME-PERCENTAGES\r\n                            IN HEAVY CLAY SOILS.\r\n    ============================+===========================+===========\r\n                                |        Mississippi.       |California.\r\n                                +---------+-------+---------+-----------\r\n                                |Flatwoods|  Hog- |  Ridge  |  Yellow\r\n                                | Pontotoc| wallow| Prairie,|  ridge,\r\n                                |   Co.   | Jasper|Smith Co.|Alameda Co.\r\n                                |         |  Co.  |         |\r\n    ----------------------------+---------+-------+---------+-----------\r\n    No. Sample.                 |   230   |  242  |   203   |     4\r\n    ----------------------------+---------+-------+---------+-----------\r\n        CHEMICAL ANALYSIS OF    |         |       |         |\r\n             FINE EARTH.        |         |       |         |\r\n    ----------------------------+---------+-------+---------+-----------\r\n    Insoluble matter            |   77.85 | 76.76 |   51.75 |   86.00\r\n    Soluble silica              |         |       |         |\r\n    ----------------------------+---------+-------+---------+-----------\r\n    Potash (K₂O)                |     .75 |   .53 |     .53 |     .19\r\n    Soda (Na₂O)                 |     .11 |   .19 |     .22 |     .15\r\n    Lime (CaO)                  |     .18 |   .42 |     .48 |     .48\r\n    Magnesia (MgO)              |     .83 |   .67 |    1.01 |     .45\r\n    Br. ox. of Manganese (Mn₃O₄)|     .17 |   .56 |     .10 |     .04\r\n    Peroxid of Iron (Fe₂O₃)     |    5.90 |  4.12 |   23.79 |    4.01\r\n    Alumina (Al₂O₃)             |   10.30 | 10.06 |   10.85 |    5.53\r\n    Phosphoric acid (P₂O₅)      |     .05 |   .06 |     .15 |     .06\r\n    Sulfuric acid (SO₃)         |     .03 |   .06 |     .02 |     .02\r\n    Carbonic acid (CO₂)         |         |       |         |\r\n    Water and organic matter    |    3.69 |  5.73 |   11.39 |    4.05\r\n                                +---------+-------+---------+-----------\r\n             Total              |   99.86 | 99.17 |  100.29 |  100.99\r\n                                +---------+-------+---------+-----------\r\n                                |         |       |         |\r\n    Hygroscopic Moisture        |    9.3  |  6.8  |   19.7  |\r\n      absorbed at            °C |   22.0  |air-dry|   17.0  |\r\n    ----------------------------+---------+--------+---------+-----------\r\n\r\nAll of the soils in this table are heavy clays, very difficult to till;\r\nin all, the lime-percentage falls below .5%; and none bear any lime\r\nvegetation, the Mississippi soils having a stunted growth of black\r\njack and post oaks, such as is universally known to indicate soils too\r\npoor for profitable cultivation. The California soil bears stunted\r\nlive-oak (_Q. agrifolia_); but not being as heavy as its brethren from\r\nMississippi, though unthrifty, is more readily improved.\r\n\r\n    Comparison with the two first sandy soils in the table on\r\n    p. 352 shows, that with plant-food percentages equal to, or\r\n    even much below those here shown, not only was vigorous lime\r\n    growth present, but crop-production was good and even high.\r\n\r\nWe are thus led to the conclusion that the greater the clay percentage\r\nin a soil, the more lime carbonate it must contain in order to possess\r\nthe advantages of a calcareous soil; and that while in sandy lands lime\r\ngrowth may follow the presence of only .10% of lime, in heavy clay\r\nsoils not less than about .6% should be present to bring about the\r\nsame result. This is apparent to the eye in that the dark-tinted humus\r\ncharacteristic of truly calcareous lands, does not appear in clay soils\r\nuntil the lime-percentages rise to nearly 1%; while in sandy lands a\r\nmuch smaller amount (say .2%) will produce this effect.\r\n\r\n    _European Standards._—It is of interest to consider,\r\n    in connection with preceding discussions, the estimates\r\n    given by Maercker of Halle, of the practical value of soils\r\n    corresponding to chemical composition as ascertained by\r\n    analysis with strong acids, substantially in accordance with\r\n    the methods adopted by the writer.\r\n\r\n    PRACTICAL RATING OF SOILS BY PLANT-FOOD PERCENTAGES ACCORDING TO\r\n                 PROF.

In this respect, and almost throughout,\r\n    Maercker’s ratings are in remarkable agreement with those\r\n    made by the writer as far back as 1860.[124] It also appears\r\n    that Maercker’s figures for “normal” soils correspond to\r\n    those of the American humid regions; the “arid” figures for\r\n    potash and lime being “abnormally” high.\r\n\r\n[124] See discussions of analyses of Mississippi soils in the Report\r\non the Agriculture and Geology of Mississippi, 1860; same in Rep. On\r\nCotton Production, Tenth Census, 1880, Vol. 5; also Appendix to the\r\nReport on the Experiment Stations of the University of California,\r\n1890, p. 163.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately neither Maercker’s method of preparing the soil extract,\r\nnor his ratings as given in the table, are accepted by all soil\r\nchemists even in Germany. As will be seen by reference to Wohltmann’s\r\nwork on the soils of Samoa and Kamerun (chap. 21, p. 404), his methods\r\nand numerical estimates differ widely from those given by Maercker,\r\nand also from those adopted by the Prussian soil surveys. Reference\r\nto the analyses of the soils of Madagascar by Müntz and Rousseaux,\r\ngiven in the same chapter, page 406, shows still another different\r\nmethod, although as it happens their numerical estimates do not differ\r\nvery widely from those of Wohltmann. In both cases, a special, more\r\nincisive extraction is made for the determination of potash. Why the\r\nsame more energetic action is not used for the other ingredients also,\r\nis not stated, and is obscure. Fortunately, in all cases the action\r\nis at least sufficiently strong to secure the dissolution of all the\r\nlime existing in the form of carbonate, and of all, or nearly all, the\r\nphosphoric acid not securely locked up as ferric phosphate; the latter\r\nbeing inert, is of no special interest (see Analyses of Hawaiian Soils,\r\nthis chapter, page 256).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nSOILS OF THE ARID AND HUMID[125] REGIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of Good Medium Soils._—In the preceding tables examples\r\nhave been given of rather extreme types of soils, both rich and poor\r\nthroughout, and also of such as are deficient in one or several of\r\nthe important ingredients. In the table below are given the analyses\r\nof some of the good average farming lands; uplands of several states,\r\nboth of the humid and arid regions. In the former, the representative\r\ntimber trees of such lands are the black, red, white and (less\r\ncharacteristically) the post, black-jack, Spanish, overcup and locally\r\nsome other oaks; grading higher in proportion to the presence of more\r\nor less hickory, and lower as the latter is replaced by pine. In the\r\nstates south of Ohio, the “oak and hickory uplands” are what the farmer\r\nusually looks for, outside of the valleys or bottoms.\r\n\r\n[125] In the discussion in this chapter the “humid region” referred\r\nto is always that of the temperate zones, unless expressly otherwise\r\nstated. The most humid region of all—the tropics—is treated under a\r\nspecial head.\r\n\r\n_Criteria of Lands of the Two Regions._—In the country west of the\r\nRocky Mountains, the timber, while locally very characteristic,\r\ncannot be as broadly used as a criterion, partly on account of\r\nits scarcity, partly because the dominant factor in the growth of\r\ntrees is _moisture_, which is measurably independent of chemical\r\nsoil-composition. The latter, moreover, on account of climatic\r\nconditions, already alluded to (chapter 16), does not vary as\r\nmaterially in the arid as the humid region, on account of the almost\r\nuniversal presence of larger proportions of lime carbonate; the\r\nvariations of which in the humid region govern largely the vegetative\r\nchanges. For we there find _the timber growth of the lowlands ascending\r\ninto the uplands so soon as the latter becomes decidedly calcareous_;\r\nas is abundantly exemplified in the loess or “bluff” formations\r\nbordering the Mississippi, Ohio, and Missouri rivers, where the black\r\nwalnut, tulip tree, ash, honey-locust, together with the lowland oaks,\r\nhickories and cane usually characterizing the stream bottoms, grow\r\nabundantly and with luxuriant development on the adjoining steep hill\r\ncountry as well (see below, chapters 24, 25).\r\n\r\n                      UPLAND

 15\r\n     ----------------------+---------+-------------++---------+--------\r\n\r\n_Soils of the Humid Region._—Taking a view, first, of the table\r\nshowing the soils of the _humid_ region, it appears that the change of\r\nvegetation from walnut and hickory to the short-leaved pine bears no\r\nvisible relation to the increase or decrease of potash or phosphoric\r\nacid, but is plainly governed mainly by the amount of lime present.\r\nWhere the short-leaved pine prevails the soil is almost always either\r\nneutral or shows the alkaline reaction in the course of half an hour;\r\nbut where the long-leaved pine predominates the soil has almost always\r\nan acid reaction. The latter is also usually found in bottoms in which\r\nthe loblolly pine (_P. taeda_) prevails, and where, although the soil\r\nmay show a fair proportion of lime in the analysis, it does not exist\r\nin the form of carbonate.\r\n\r\n_The examples here given are from lands not derived from, or underlaid\r\nby, limestone formations._ Where the latter exist the percentage of\r\nlime is usually materially increased; as it is also in the lowlands or\r\nbottoms when compared with adjacent uplands (see above, chapter 10, p.\r\n162; chapter 18, p. 331); as well as in the delta lands of rivers.\r\n\r\n_Soils of the Arid Region._—Even a cursory comparison of the soils\r\nof the arid regions of the Pacific slope with those of the humid, as\r\ngiven in the above tables, shows some striking points of difference.\r\nThe most obvious is the uniformly high percentage of lime, and usually\r\nalso of magnesia, in the arid soils, and that quite independently of\r\nunderlying formations, calcareous or otherwise. This occurs despite\r\nthe fact that while limestone formations are very prevalent east of\r\nthe Rocky Mountains, they are quite scarce west of the same. The red\r\n(Laramie) sandstones of Wyoming, the slates of the foothills of the\r\nSierra Nevada, the clay shales, granites and eruptives of the Coast\r\nRanges of California, Oregon and Washington, and the varied black rocks\r\nof the great lava sheet of the Pacific Northwest, all alike produce\r\nsoils of high _lime_ content as compared with Eastern soils not derived\r\nfrom calcareous formations. This fact has already been referred to, but\r\nis more fully illustrated in the table below.\r\n\r\nAside from the lime-content, however, it will be noted in the preceding\r\ntable that the _potash_-content of the arid soils is on the average\r\nconsiderably higher than in those of the humid region. In fact it is\r\nhard to find west of the Rocky Mountains (except where high elevation\r\ncauses a humid climate) any soils as poor in potash as are many of the\r\ncommonly cultivated lands of the Eastern United States.\r\n\r\nOther ingredients do not show such marked differences from the purely\r\nchemical standpoint: yet, as will be shown below, the forms in which\r\nsilica and alumina occur are also not inconsiderably modified.\r\n\r\nGENERAL COMPARISON OF SOILS FROM THE ARID AND HUMID REGIONS OF THE\r\nUNITED STATES.[126]—In order to verify the conclusions just mentioned\r\nupon the broadest basis possible, the following table has been compiled\r\nfrom all available sources; partly published, partly in manuscript\r\nonly, having remained in the writer’s hands since the cessation of\r\nthe Northern Transcontinental Survey, prosecuted from 1880 to 1883,\r\nunder the auspices of the Northern Pacific Railroad, in Washington\r\nand Montana. The published data are derived partly from the records\r\nof State surveys, partly from the soil work connected with the Tenth\r\nCensus; partly also from those of Experiment Stations. In most cases\r\nit has of course been necessary to restrict the comparison to such\r\nanalyses as have been made by substantially identical methods, for\r\nreasons already given; but in the cases of some states from which\r\nnumerous analyses made by the Kedzie method, adopted by the Association\r\nof Official Chemists, were available, the average has been given but\r\nthe name of the state starred, to indicate that the percentages,\r\nexcepting phosphoric acid, are lower than they would be if made by\r\nthe method adopted by the writer, particularly as regards potash. The\r\nadoption of the one-millimeter mesh for the fine-earth sieve instead of\r\nthe half-millimeter size also creates an unfortunate and ineliminable\r\ndiscrepancy.\r\n\r\n[126] Abstracted and revised from Bulletin No. 3, U. S. Weather Bureau,\r\n1893.\r\n\r\nIn order to exhibit clearly the influence of climate as distinct from\r\nother local conditions, it was also necessary to eliminate, in both the\r\narid and humid regions, the soils directly derived from, or connected\r\nwith calcareous formations; such as the prairies of the Southwestern\r\nStates, the Bluegrass region of Kentucky, etc. This rule having been\r\napplied impartially to the soils of both climatic regions, it can\r\nhardly be questioned that the conclusions flowing from a discussion of\r\nthe results of the comparison are entitled to as much weight as are\r\nthose of any comparison based on large numbers of observations made,\r\nnot with reference to the special point under consideration, but with\r\na practical object of which the governing conditions were more or less\r\nuncertain, and required to be ascertained by a process of elimination.\r\n\r\n    The table gives, first, the averages for each ingredient for\r\n    each of the states represented, the number of analyses from\r\n    which the averages are derived being given in each case.\r\n    These averages are given separately for the states of the\r\n    humid and the arid regions respectively; and at the base\r\n    of each group the grand average is shown in two forms. The\r\n    first gives the figures as derived from the aggregate number\r\n    of soil analyses in each great group, being 696 for the\r\n    humid, 178 for the transition region and 573 for the arid,\r\n    divided into the totals resulting from the summation of each\r\n    ingredient for the whole 696, 178 and 573, respectively.\r\n\r\n    The second form is that in which the soils of each state\r\n    are considered as representative of the general character\r\n    of such state, as the result of intentional selection; such\r\n    as actually occurred in the cases of those included in the\r\n    census work of 1880. The figures given here are therefore\r\n    the result of a summation of the _state averages_\r\n    as such, and of their division by the number of states\r\n    represented.\r\n\r\n    It will be noted that while these two modes of presentation\r\n    do change the figures a little, yet in either form the\r\n    same general result is outlined with striking accuracy.\r\n    It is also notable that notwithstanding the less complete\r\n    extraction of soil-ingredients in the starred (★)states,\r\n    the general ratios between arid and humid soils remain\r\n    substantially the same. For Western Oregon, local calcareous\r\n    formations compel omission of three lime figures from the\r\n    averages.\r\n\r\n                AVERAGE COMPARISON OF SOILS IN THE HUMID AND ARID

This\r\ndifference is so great that no accidental errors in the selection\r\nor analysis of the soils can to any material degree weaken the\r\noverwhelming proof of the correctness of the inference drawn upon\r\ntheoretical grounds, viz., that the soils of the arid regions must be\r\nricher in lime than those of the humid countries. For the differences\r\nin derivation would, in view of the wide prevalence of limestone\r\nformations in the humid regions concerned, produce exactly the reverse\r\ncondition of things from that which is actually found to exist; and\r\nif further proof were needed it can readily be found in the detailed\r\ndiscussion of the analyses of the soils of the arid areas forming the\r\ncontrast. This shows that for instance, in Washington highly calcareous\r\nsoils are directly derived from the black basaltic rocks; while\r\nsimilarly, calcareous lands are found in California to be the outcome\r\nof the decomposition of granites, diorites, lavas, clay-shales and\r\nsandstones.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to overrate the importance of this feature of the\r\nsoils of the arid region, as it is intimately connected with other\r\ntheoretically and practically important facts, in part already\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\n_Summary of Effects of Lime Carbonate in Soils._—It is best to\r\nsummarize, briefly, at this point, the advantages (and possible\r\ndisadvantages), resulting from the presence of a proper amount of lime\r\ncarbonate in soils, so far as these are at present understood.\r\n\r\n_Physically_, even a small amount of lime carbonate, by its solubility\r\nin the carbonated soil-water, will act most beneficially in causing\r\nthe flocculation of clay and in the subsequent conservation of the\r\nflocculent or tilth condition, by acting as a light cement holding\r\nthe soil-crumbs together when the capillary water has evaporated;\r\nthus favoring the penetration of both water and air, and of the roots\r\nthemselves. It should be added that according to the experience of the\r\nwriter, amounts of lime carbonate in excess of 2% do not add to the\r\nfavorable effects, except as would so much sand.\r\n\r\nAs to chemical effects, among the most important are:—\r\n\r\n1. The maintenance of the neutrality of the soil, by the neutralization\r\nof acids formed by the decay of organic matter, or otherwise.\r\n\r\n2. The maintenance, in connection with the proper degrees of moisture\r\nand warmth, of the conditions of abundant bacterial life (see above,\r\nchapter 9, p. 146); more especially those of nitrification, thus\r\nsupplying the readily assimilable form of nitrogen. Also in favoring\r\nthe development and activity of the root bacteria of legumes, and of\r\nthe other nitrogen-gathering bacteria, such as Azotobacter (ibid. p.\r\n156).\r\n\r\n3. The rendering available, directly or indirectly, of relatively small\r\npercentages of plant-food, notably phosphoric acid and potash; as shown\r\nin the preceding pages.\r\n\r\n4. The prompt conversion of vegetable matter into black, neutral\r\nhumus, and (as shown in the case of the soils of the arid region) the\r\nconcentration of the nitrogen in the same; while accelerating the\r\noxidation of the carbon and hydrogen, as shown by S. W. Johnson and\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n6. It counteracts the deleterious influence of an excess of magnesia in\r\nthe soil, as first shown by Loew,[127] and verified by his pupils in\r\nJapan.\r\n\r\n7. In alkali soils, according to Cameron and May, it counteracts the\r\ninjurious action of the soluble salts upon the growth of plants,\r\nnot only in the form of carbonate, but also in those of sulfate and\r\nchlorid.[128]\r\n\r\n[127] Bull. No. 1, Div. Veget. Physiol, and Plant Pathol. U. S. Dept.\r\nAgr.; et al.\r\n\r\n[128] Loeb, Publications of the Spreckel’s Physiological Laboratory of\r\nthe University of California, has shown a similar protective influence\r\nof the lime salts in sea-water, against the other salts, in the case of\r\nthe lower marine organisms.\r\n\r\n8. As a matter of experience, both in the case of grapes and orchard as\r\nwell as wild fruits, an adequate but not excessive supply of lime in\r\nthe soil will produce sweeter fruit than when lime is in small supply.\r\n\r\n9. An excess of carbonate of lime in soils (from eight to twenty per\r\ncent and more), constituting “marliness,” tends to seriously disturb\r\nthe nutrition and general functions of many plants (calcifuge), and to\r\nproduce a suppression or diminution of the formation of chlorophyll and\r\nstarch; as in the case of grape vines, citrus fruits and others, which\r\nnevertheless flourish best in lands moderately calcareous.\r\n\r\nAmong the points thus enumerated the third and fourth require some\r\ncomment. Without pretending to define exactly how lime acts in\r\nrendering other ingredients more available to plant assimilation,\r\nattention may be called to the fact that lime carbonate may be\r\nconsidered as acting similarly to, albeit more mildly than, caustic\r\nlime, in the displacement of other bases from their compounds. It\r\ndoubtless acts thus in liberating potash from its zeolitic compounds.\r\nAs to phosphoric acid, the connection of the effect of lime carbonate\r\nwith the remarkable availability of that substance when present in the\r\nform of tetra-basic salt, in the case of phosphate slag, is at least\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n    As to the action of lime carbonate in forming humus,[129] no\r\n    one who has observed the characteristic dark black tint of\r\n    our calcareous “prairie soils” can question the fact; which\r\n    moreover is perfectly explicable upon the analogy already\r\n    alluded to, with caustic lime, which, together with caustic\r\n    alkalies (potash and soda), is known to act powerfully in\r\n    the conversion of vegetable matter into humus. That instead\r\n    of liberating the nitrogen in the form of ammonia, as do the\r\n    caustic hydrates, the milder carbonate should only cause\r\n    the formation of humic amides, is quite intelligible. That\r\n    such is really the case, has been conclusively proved by\r\n    the investigations of the writer made conjointly with M.\r\n    E. Jaffa (Rep. Sta. Cal. Agr. Expt. 1892-4); the general\r\n    result being that while in the humid region the average\r\n    nitrogen-content of soil-humus is less than 5%, in the\r\n    upland soils of the arid region (where _all_ soils\r\n    are calcareous) that percentage rises as high as 22.0%,\r\n    with a general average of between 15 and 16%. That such\r\n    highly nitrogenous material can be more readily attacked\r\n    by the nitrifying bacteria than when a large excess of\r\n    other oxidable matter is present, is at least a legitimate\r\n    presumption, especially in view of the very active\r\n    nitrification known to take place in the arid regions\r\n    everywhere. So long as a large excess of carbohydrates\r\n    is present, the oxidation of these will naturally take\r\n    precedence over that of the relatively inert nitrogen. The\r\n    accumulation of the latter in the humus-substance of the\r\n    arid region, where oxidation of the organic matter of the\r\n    soil is very active, points strongly to this view of the\r\n    case.\r\n\r\n[129] “Black Soils;” Agric. Science, January, 1892.\r\n\r\n_Magnesia._—While the differences in respect to the proportions of\r\nlime are the most prominent and decided, yet the related substance,\r\nmagnesia, shows also a very marked and constant difference as between\r\nthe soils of the humid and arid regions. It will be observed that the\r\ngeneral average for magnesia in the soils of the Atlantic Slope is\r\nabout double that of lime; Florida and Rhode Island being the only\r\nstates in which the average is lower for magnesia than for lime. In\r\nthe arid region, on the contrary, magnesia on the general average is\r\nnearly the same as lime; in the average by states, somewhat less; thus\r\nbringing the ratio for the two regions for magnesia up to one to six\r\nor seven. This also is so decisive a showing that no accident could\r\nbring it about. We must conclude that climatic influences have dealt\r\nwith magnesia similarly as with lime; which from the standpoint of\r\nthe chemist is just what might be expected, since magnesia carbonate\r\nbehaves very much like that of lime toward carbonated waters.\r\n\r\nThat magnesia is a very important plant-food ingredient is apparent\r\nfrom its invariable and rather abundant presence in the seeds\r\nof plants, where it takes precedence of lime. Its functions in\r\nplant nutrition have been specially investigated by O. Loew,[130]\r\nparticularly with respect to its relations to lime. As already\r\nstated in connection with the soil-forming properties of magnesian\r\nminerals (see chapter 2), soils containing large proportions of\r\nmagnesia generally are found to be unthrifty, the lands so constituted\r\nbeing frequently designated as “barrens.” Loew finds that certain\r\nproportions of lime to magnesia must be preserved if production is to\r\nbe satisfactory, the proportion varying with different plants, some\r\nof which (_e. g._ oats) will do well when the proportion of lime to\r\nmagnesia is as 1:1, while others require, that that ratio should be as\r\n2 or 3 is to 1, to secure the best results. In general it is best that\r\nlime should exceed magnesia in amount.\r\n\r\n[130] Bull. No. 18, Div. Vegetable Physiology and Plant Pathology;\r\nBull. No. 1, Bureau of Plant Industry, U. S. Dept. of Agr.; Bull.\r\nCollege of Agriculture, Tokyo, Vol. 4, No. 5.\r\n\r\n    Loew explains the injurious action of magnesium salts thus:\r\n    The calcium nucleo-proteids of the organic structures are\r\n    transformed in presence of soluble salts of magnesium\r\n    into magnesium compounds, while the calcium of the former\r\n    enters into combination with the acid of the magnesium\r\n    salt. By this transformation the capacity for imbibition\r\n    will change, which must result in a fatal disturbance of\r\n    functions. The presence of soluble lime salts will prevent\r\n    that interchange. Thus certain algæ perished in a solution\r\n    containing 1 per 1000 of magnesium nitrate, but remained\r\n    alive when .3 per 1000 of calcium nitrate was added.\r\n\r\nMagnesia seems to be specially concerned in the transfer of phosphoric\r\nacid through the plant tissues, in the form of dimagnesic-hydric\r\nphosphate, which is rather soluble in the acid juices of plants. It is\r\nprobable that, apart from the relations just referred to, such excess\r\nof lime as is known to produce chlorosis in plants interferes with the\r\ntransfer of the magnesic phosphate. Some plants, as already stated,\r\ndispose of an excess of lime by depositing it in the form of oxalate,\r\nwhile others (such as the stone crops) excrete it on the surface of\r\nleaves and stems in the form of carbonate. But others seem to possess\r\nthis power to a limited extent only.\r\n\r\nIn the case of soils containing much magnesia the proper proportion\r\nbetween it and lime may easily be disturbed by the greater ease with\r\nwhich lime carbonate is carried away by carbonated water into the\r\nsubsoil, thus leaving the magnesia in undesirable excess in the surface\r\nsoil. Hence the great advantage of having in a soil, from the outset,\r\nan ample proportion of lime. From this point of view alone, then, the\r\nanalytical determination of lime and magnesia in soils is of high\r\npractical value.\r\n\r\n    Aso, Furuta and Katayama (Bull. Coll. Agr. Tokyo, Vol. 4\r\n    No. 5; Ibid. Vol. 6), have by direct experiment determined\r\n    the most advantageous ratio of lime to magnesia in several\r\n    crop plants. They find for rice and oats 1:1, for cabbage\r\n    2:1, for buckwheat 3:1; there being apparently a connection\r\n    between the extent of leaf-surface and lime requirement,\r\n    since leaves contain predominantly lime, while in the fruit,\r\n    magnesia predominates.\r\n\r\n_Manganese._—A decided difference in the manganese content of the arid\r\nas against the humid soils appears in the table, the ratio being about\r\n11:13 in favor of the humid soils. Manganese has not been regarded as\r\nbeing of special importance to plant growth in general, although, as\r\nalready stated, some plants contain a relatively large proportion of\r\nmanganese in their ashes; thus, _e. g._, the leaves of the long-leaved\r\npine of the cotton states.[131] But no definite data showing the\r\nimportance of this element to crops were available until Loew and\r\nhis co-workers at Tokyo[132] established its stimulating action in a\r\nnumber of cases, in which crop production was materially increased by\r\nthe use of protoxid salts of manganese. Aso[133] applied manganous\r\nchlorid to an experimental plot of thirty square meters, at the rate of\r\ntwenty-five kilos of Mn₃O₄ per acre, and thus obtained a yield of rice\r\none-third greater than on the control plot, at a cost of about $2.00,\r\nwhile the value of the increase of the product was nearly $68.00.\r\nMore experimental evidence on this subject is required to establish\r\nthe _general_ value of the large-scale use of the salts of manganese;\r\nwhich are obtained in large quantities as a comparatively valueless\r\nby-product of the bleaching industries.\r\n\r\n[131] Rep. Agr. and Geology of Mississippi, 1860, p. 360.\r\n\r\n[132] Bull. Agr. Coll. Tokyo, Vol. V., Nos. 2 and 4.\r\n\r\n[133] Ibid. Vol. 6.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The “Insoluble Residue.”_\r\n\r\nRemembering, in discussing the facts shown by the table, that the\r\nfundamental difference between the regime of the humid and arid regions\r\nis the presence in the latter of an almost continuous leaching process,\r\nin which the carbonated water of the soil is the solvent; remembering,\r\nalso, that the least soluble portion of rocks and soils is quartz or\r\nsilica (sand, as usually understood), it would be predicable that this\r\ningredient should in the humid region be found to be more abundant in\r\nsoils than in the arid. This portion is represented by the “insoluble\r\nresidue” of the table.\r\n\r\nInspection shows that both in the averages of the single states, and in\r\nboth of the general averages, this difference between the soils of the\r\nhumid and the arid regions of the United States is strongly pronounced;\r\nthe ratio being substantially as 69% in the arid region to 84% in the\r\nhumid.\r\n\r\nWe must then conclude that the leaching process must have influenced\r\nmaterially other soil ingredients than lime, which have remained behind\r\nin such amounts as to depress the percentage of insoluble residue in\r\nthe soils. It remains to be shown what are the substances so retained.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Insoluble and Soluble Silica and Alumina._\r\n\r\nThe ingredient most nearly correlated with the insoluble residue is the\r\nfree silica which remains behind with it when the acid with which the\r\nsoil has been treated is evaporated to dryness. The silica is separated\r\nfrom the practically insoluble, undecomposed minerals by boiling with a\r\nstrong solution of sodic carbonate. The amount of this “soluble silica”\r\nis obviously the measure of the extent to which the soil-silicates have\r\nbeen decomposed in the treatment with acid.\r\n\r\nThe most prominent of these is usually supposed to be clay—the hydrous\r\nsilicate of alumina that in its purest condition forms kaolinite or\r\nporcelain earth. Any alumina found in the usual course of soil analysis\r\nis generally referred to this mineral, which contains silica and\r\nalumina nearly in the proportion of 46% to 40%.\r\n\r\nIn very many cases, however, the reference of these two ingredients\r\nto clay is manifestly unjustified. This is clearly so when (as not\r\nunfrequently happens) the amount of alumina found exceeds that which\r\nwould form clay with the ascertained percentage of soluble silica; it\r\nis almost as certainly so when, in addition to the alumina, other bases\r\n(notably potash, lime and magnesia), are found in proportions which\r\npreclude their being in combination with any other acidic compounds\r\npresent. The only possible inference in such cases is that these\r\nbases, together with at least a portion of the alumina, are present in\r\nthe form of hydrated, and therefore easily decomposable silicates or\r\nzeolites.\r\n\r\n    The subjoined analysis by R. H. Loughridge, of a clay\r\n    obtained in the usual process of mechanical soil analysis\r\n    (by precipitating with common salt the turbid water\r\n    remaining after 24 hours subsidence in a column of 200\r\n    millimeters) from a very generalized soil of northern\r\n    Mississippi, shows one of the many cases in which the\r\n    numerical ratios of the several ingredients are incompatible\r\n    with the assumption that silica and alumina are present in\r\n    combination as clay (kaolinite) only:\r\n\r\n           ANALYSIS OF COLLOIDAL CLAY.\r\n\r\n    Insoluble matter                     15.96\r\n    Soluble silica                       33.10\r\n    Potash (K₂O)                          1.47\r\n    Soda (Na₂O)                           1.70\r\n    Lime (CaO)                             .09\r\n    Magnesia (MgO)                        1.33\r\n    Br. ox. of Manganese (Mn₃O₄)           .30\r\n    Peroxid of iron (Fe₂O₃)               18.76\r\n    Alumina (Al₂O₃)                      18.19\r\n    Phosphoric acid (P₂O₅)                 .18\r\n    Sulfuric acid (SO₃)                    .06\r\n    Carbonic acid (CO₂)                    .00\r\n    Water and organic matter              9.00\r\n                                        ------\r\n              Total                     100.14\r\n\r\n    If in this case we assign all alumina to silica, as required\r\n    for the composition of kaolinite or pure clay, there yet\r\n    remains a trifle over twelve (12.17) per cent of silica to\r\n    be allotted to the other bases present. Deducting from this\r\n    the ascertained amount of silica soluble in sodic carbonate,\r\n    pre-existing in the raw material (.38 per cent), we come to\r\n    11.79 per cent as the amount of silica which must have been\r\n    in combinations other than kaolinite, viz., hydrous\r\n    silicates, or soil zeolites, formed either with the\r\n    bases other than alumina shown in the analysis or, more\r\n    probably, containing some of the alumina itself in essential\r\n    combination.\r\n\r\n    We are thus enabled to obtain from the determination of the\r\n    soluble silica an estimate of the extent to which these\r\n    soil zeolites, that form so important a portion of the soil\r\n    in being the repositories of the reserve of more or less\r\n    available mineral plant-food, are present in the soils of\r\n    the several regions. A glance at the table shows that the\r\n    general average of soluble silica is very much greater in\r\n    the soils of the arid regions than in those of the humid,\r\n    approximating one to two in favor of the arid division.[134]\r\n\r\n[134] Looking at the details of the several states, we find that on the\r\narid side Washington has a relatively low figure for soluble silica,\r\nwhich in the average, however, is overborne by the high figures for\r\nCalifornia and Montana. The explanation of this fact probably lies\r\nin the derivation of the majority of the Washington soils examined,\r\nfrom lake deposits brought down gradually from the humid region at the\r\nheads of the Columbia drainage, where sandy beds are very prevalent;\r\nwhile the country rock—the basaltic eruptives—are very basic, and\r\nmoreover slow to disintegrate. In California and Montana the rocks\r\nare infinitely varied, and the general outcome of their weathering is\r\nplainly a predominance of complex hydrous silicates in the soils, as\r\ncompared with humid regions.\r\n\r\n_Differences in the Sands of the Arid and Humid Regions._—In chapter\r\n5 mention has been made of the fact that while in the humid regions,\r\n“sand” as a rule means quartz grains, mostly with a clean surface and\r\nvery frequently rounded and polished, in the arid regions even the\r\ncoarse sand grains consist of, or are covered with, a great variety\r\nof minerals in a partially decomposed condition. This is owing to the\r\nabsence of the abundant rainfall which in humid climates continually\r\nwashes down the finely divided, half-decomposed mineral matter into\r\nthe subsoil; while in arid climates the light rains cannot produce any\r\nsuch washing effect and hence the sand grains remain incrusted with the\r\nproducts of either their own decomposition, or of that of neighboring\r\nparticles; it being therefore not concentrated in the finer portion\r\nonly, viz., the clay and finest silts. This fundamental difference,\r\nwhich is illustrated in the analytical table below, at once explains\r\nwhy in the arid regions generally, sandy soils are found so highly\r\nproductive that, owing to their easy cultivation they are preferred to\r\nthe clayey lands, in which tillage and irrigation are more difficult.\r\nIt is a well-known fact that on the “sands of the desert” when either\r\nirrigated, or wetted by rain, vegetation at once springs up with\r\nremarkable luxuriance, even on sand drifts; and this productiveness\r\nappears to be quite as lasting as that of “strong” clay soils of the\r\nhumid regions.\r\n\r\n    This difference is curiously illustrated on the southern\r\n    edge of the “black adobe” or prairie soil area which\r\n    surrounds Stockton, Cal. Here we find on the opposite sides\r\n    of a small stream (French Camp slough) the two extremes,\r\n    of heavy clay and the sandy soils which for many years\r\n    made Stanislaus county the “banner” county for wheat. The\r\n    grain product of both banks ranked alike in quantity and\r\n    quality in average years; but in extreme seasons sometimes\r\n    one, sometimes the other failed, according to the weather\r\n    conditions which favored one or the other soil. No one would\r\n    think of sowing wheat on so sandy a soil in the humid States.\r\n\r\n    Table Illustrating Difference in Sands of the Humid and Arid Regions.\r\n\r\n

In the soils of regions where\r\nsummer rains are insignificant or wanting, these solutions not only\r\nremain, but are concentrated by evaporation to a point that, in the\r\nnature of the case, can never be reached in humid climates. Prominent\r\namong these soluble ingredients are the silicates and carbonates of\r\nthe two alkalies, potash and soda. The former, when filtered through\r\na soil containing the carbonates of lime and magnesia, will soon be\r\ntransformed into complex silicates, in which potash takes precedence\r\nof soda, and which, existing in a very finely divided (at the outset\r\nin a gelatinous) condition, serve as an ever-ready reservoir to catch\r\nand store the lingering alkalies as they are set free from the rocks,\r\nwhether in the form of soluble silicates or carbonates. The latter have\r\nanother important effect: in the concentrated form at least, they,\r\nthemselves, are effective in decomposing silicate minerals refractory\r\nto milder agencies, such as calcic carbonate solution; and thus the\r\nmore decomposed state in which we find the soil minerals of the arid\r\nregions is intelligible on that ground alone.\r\n\r\n    It must not be forgotten that lime carbonate, though\r\n    less effective than the corresponding alkali solutions,\r\n    nevertheless is also known to produce, by long-continued\r\n    action, chemical effects similar to those that are more\r\n    quickly and energetically brought about by the action of\r\n    caustic lime. In fact, the agricultural effects of “liming”\r\n    are only in degree different from those produced by marling\r\n    with finely pulverized carbonate; and in nature the same\r\n    relation is strikingly exemplified in the peculiarly black\r\n    humus that is characteristic of calcareous lands, but which\r\n    can be much more quickly formed under the influence of\r\n    caustic lime on peaty soils.\r\n\r\n    In the analysis of silicates we employ caustic lime for the\r\n    setting-free of the alkalies and the formation of easily\r\n    decomposable silicates, by igniting the mixture; but the\r\n    carbonate will slowly produce a similar change, both in\r\n    the laboratory and in the soils in which it is constantly\r\n    present. This is strikingly seen when we contrast the\r\n    analyses of calcareous clay soils of the humid region with\r\n    the corresponding non-calcareous ones of the same. In the\r\n    former the proportions of dissolved silica and alumina are\r\n    almost invariably much greater than in the latter, so far as\r\n    such comparisons are practicable without assured absolute\r\n    identity of materials. That is, calcareous clays or clay\r\n    soils are so sure to yield to the analyst large precipitates\r\n    of alumina, that experience teaches him to employ smaller\r\n    amounts for analysis than he would of non-calcareous\r\n    materials, in order to avoid unmanageably large bulks of\r\n    aluminic hydrate. It is but rarely that even the heaviest\r\n    non-calcareous soils yield to the acid usually used in soil\r\n    analysis more than 10 per cent of alumina; while heavy\r\n    calcareous clay (prairie) soils commonly yield between 13\r\n    and 20 per cent.[141] It would be interesting to verify this\r\n    relation by artificial digestions of one and the same clays\r\n    with calcic carbonate at high temperatures, as it must\r\n    always be extremely difficult to insure absolute identity of\r\n    all other conditions in natural materials.\r\n\r\n    In most of these cases, what is true of alumina is also true\r\n    of the soluble silica. But since the latter is constantly\r\n    liable to be dissolved out by solutions of carbonated\r\n    alkalies, it is not surprising that this relation is not\r\n    always shown.\r\n\r\n[141] Report of the Tenth Census, Vols. 5 & 6; see especially the\r\nanalyses of soils from Mississippi and Alabama. Also the Reports of the\r\nCalifornia Experiment Station.\r\n\r\n_Aluminic Hydrate._—In numerous cases, the amount of alumina\r\ndissolved in analysis is greatly in excess of the soluble silica,\r\nso as to force the conclusion that a portion of the latter must be\r\npresent in a different form from that of clay (kaolinite); the only\r\nchoice being between that of complex hydrous silicates (none of\r\nwhich, however, could contain as large a percentage of alumina as\r\nclay itself) and _aluminic hydrate_. The latter is alone capable of\r\nexplaining the presence of more alumina than silica in easily soluble\r\nform;[142] and the visible occurrence of “gibbsite” and “bauxite” in\r\nmodern formaations renders this a perfectly simple and acceptable\r\nexplanation. Since these minerals are known to be incapable of\r\ncrystallization, we are moreover led to the presumption that it will as\r\na rule be found in the finest portions of the soil, viz., in the “clay”\r\nof mechanical analysis.\r\n\r\n[142] Excepting the relatively rare minerals of the Allophane,\r\nKollyrite, and Miloshite group.\r\n\r\n    Some illustrations of these conditions are given below, for\r\n    soils from Mississippi and California. The soluble silica\r\n    being all assigned to kaolinite, the rest of the alumina\r\n    must be assumed to be present as hydrate, since no other\r\n    compound could fulfil the stoichiometrical requirements.[143]\r\n    The table therefore shows the differences between the\r\n    amounts of alumina found by analysis, and those assignable\r\n    to kaolinite, calculated to the mineral bauxite—the\r\n    most abundant, as well as the one containing the medium\r\n    proportion of water, among the three naturally occurring\r\n    aluminic hydrates.\r\n\r\n    TABLE SHOWING EXCESS OF ALUMINA OVER SILICA IN SOILS;\r\n               CALCULATED AS BAUXITE.\r\n\r\n    (A) = Total soluble in HCl.\r\n    (B) = Corresponding to Bauxite.\r\n    (C) = Other Soluble Matters.\r\n    Miss. = Mississippi.\r\n    Cal.  = California.\r\n    -------+---------------+--------+------+-----+----+-----+-----+-----\r\n    Number.| Name of Soil. |County. |State.| (A) |SiO₂|Al₂O₃| (B) | (C)\r\n    -------+---------------+--------+------+-----+----+-----+-----+-----\r\n      195  |Prairie        |Alcorn  | Miss.|28.57| 3.6| 14.4|14.12| 2.92\r\n      346  |Dark Loam      |Chicasaw|   “  |10.32| 6.6| 11.2| 6.91|  .86\r\n      288  |Flatwoods Clay |Pontotoc|   “  |26.94| 5.0| 11.3| 8.75| 3.48\r\n      676  |Red Volcanic   |Lake    |  Cal.|41.00| 5.9| 22.6|21.90| 2.00\r\n      332  |Mojave Desert  |Kern    |   “  |24.82| 5.0|  9.2| 6.10| 5.13\r\n      191  |Red Foothill   |Merced  |   “  |23.32| 4.5|  8.8| 6.20| 3.05\r\n    -------+---------------+--------+------+-----+----+-----+-----+-----\r\n      705  |Red Chaparral  |Shasta  |   “  |28.75| 5.5| 14.4|12.10| 1.12\r\n      706  | “      “      |        |      |     |    |     |     |\r\n           |       Subsoil |  “     |   “  |28.40| 4.7| 17.4|16.70| 1.32\r\n    -------+---------------+--------+------+-----+----+-----+-----+-----\r\n      573  |Tulare Plains  |Tulare  |   “  |29.27| 3.4|  8.7| 7.20|11.16\r\n      701  |Dry Bog        |  “     |   “  |27.29| 4.3| 12.4|10.90| 5.04\r\n     1004  |“Slickens“ Sed.|Butte   |   “  |30.80| 8.0| 14.2| 9.20| 1.95\r\n      656  |    “       “  |Yuba    |   “  |22.23| 3.0| 10.4| 9.80| 2.19\r\n      517  |Brownish Loam  |Butte   |   “  |29.80| 4.8| 12.0| 9.80| 4.42\r\n      561  |Black Loam     |  “     |   “  |30.21| 3.2| 13.0|12.80| 4.67\r\n    -------+---------------+--------+------+-----+----+-----+-----+-----\r\n      563  |Sacramento     |        |      |     |    |     |     |\r\n           |     Alluvium  |  “     |   “  |23.46| 2.7| 10.4|10.90| 4.58\r\n    -------+---------------+--------+------+-----+----+-----+-----+-----\r\n      863  |Red Foothill   |Nevada  |   “  |56.80|11.0| 36.4|33.60| 1.22\r\n      861  | “     “       |  “     |   “  |45.46|11.5| 22.0|14.10| 3.97\r\n    -------+---------------+--------+------+-----+----+-----+-----+-----\r\n\r\n    It is apparent from this table that if, as is probable, the\r\n    aluminic hydrate accumulates in the “clay” of the analysis,\r\n    it will in some cases form a very considerable percentage\r\n    of the same, and detract to that extent from its plastic,\r\n    adhesive and other properties. But it must be remembered\r\n    that the assumption upon which this table is calculated,\r\n    leaves out of consideration the zeolitic portion, which as\r\n    the 6th column shows, is frequently quite large as measured\r\n    by the bases found, to which no other form of combination\r\n    can be assigned. Since some of the alumina undoubtedly\r\n    takes part in the formation of such zeolites, the silica\r\n    must to that extent be withdrawn from the estimate made\r\n    for kaolinite. While it is impossible to make any definite\r\n    numerical allowance for this fact, it clearly will tend in\r\n    many cases to increase materially the amount of alumina that\r\n    must be assigned to the hydrate condition. It will be noted\r\n    that in most cases given, the alumina per cent is rather\r\n    large.\r\n\r\n[143] Since any complex zeolite would contain _less_ alumina than\r\nkaolinite, this assumption more than covers the possible zeolitic\r\nalumina.\r\n\r\nThe relatively large number of such cases shown in the table for\r\nCalifornia soils is not a matter of accident; for even a cursory glance\r\nat the columns of analyses of California (and Washington and Montana)\r\nsoils, shows that the cases in which the alumina exceeds the silica\r\nin amount are rather predominant, while the reverse is the case in\r\nthe humid region.[144] But it must not be inferred that the reverse\r\nrelation is not also frequently observed even in the arid region; it\r\noccurs in fact in close proximity to the localities where some of the\r\nmost striking instances of excess of alumina over soluble silica have\r\nbeen found.\r\n\r\n[144] See for comparison the data given in vols. 5 and 6 of the report\r\nof the Tenth Census of the United States.\r\n\r\n    Thus Nos. 861 and 863 from the neighborhood of Grass Valley,\r\n    which show this excess most strikingly, occur within 15\r\n    miles of localities which show almost the reversal of the\r\n    numbers given for the two former, and at a level of about a\r\n    thousand feet lower. It would seem, on the whole, that the\r\n    excess of alumina occurs most frequently in connection with\r\n    soils formed from eruptive rocks; in the case referred to,\r\n    from volcanic ash. It will require more detailed study to\r\n    detect the causes of these marked differences.\r\n\r\n    _Retention of Soluble Silica in Alkali Soils._—It is\r\n    somewhat surprising that, contrary to the expectation one\r\n    would naturally entertain, the alkali lands, so frequently\r\n    rich in the carbonates of the alkalies that would dissolve\r\n    free silica, on the contrary, show most frequently an\r\n    excess of soluble silica over alumina. This is probably to\r\n    be explained from the very liberal opportunities afforded\r\n    in the alkali soils for the formation of complex zeolitic\r\n    masses by the retention in soil of the soluble alkali\r\n    salts, and the abundance of lime always present in them. As\r\n    already stated, we usually find in alkali soils a very large\r\n    proportion of both alkaline and earthy bases in acid-soluble\r\n    silicate combinations. But much farther research is needed\r\n    to explain fully the marked discrepancies observed in\r\n    this respect between soils not only occurring in closely\r\n    contiguous localities, but also showing marked similarities\r\n    in their general composition.\r\n\r\n_Ferric Hydrate._—There is no obvious reason, from the chemical\r\nstandpoint, why iron, that is, ferric hydrate or iron rust, should be\r\nmore abundant in the soils of the arid regions, as the averages given\r\nin the table suggest; moreover, the fact does not impress itself upon\r\nthe eye, since the orange or reddish tints are by far more common in\r\nthe humid than in the arid regions of the United States at least.\r\nThe California average is considerably influenced by the very highly\r\nferruginous soils from the foothills of the Sierra Nevada, and by the\r\nblack (magnetite) sand so commonly present; that of Oregon by the\r\nblack, highly ferruginous country rock (basalts), from which they are\r\npartly derived. The average for Montana is not higher than that of\r\nthree states of the humid region, and less than that of Kentucky. We\r\nmight imagine a cause for depletion of iron in the soils of the humid\r\nareas in the frequency with which humid moisture and high temperature\r\nwill during the summers concur toward the bringing about of a reducing\r\nprocess in the soil, which by getting the iron into proto-carbonate\r\nsolution would make it liable to be leached into the subsoil, as is\r\nfrequently the case; yet the resulting “black gravel” or bog ore, in\r\nits various forms, is of not infrequent occurrence in the arid regions\r\nalso. A constant quantitative difference due to climatic conditions\r\ndoes not appear to be shown by the data thus far at command, but the\r\n_finer distribution_ of the ferric hydrate in the humid temperate as\r\nwell tropical regions is obvious to the observer, from the frequent\r\nredness of humid and tropical soils.\r\n\r\n_Manganese._—An unexpected and apparently well-defined contrary\r\nrelation appears to be shown as regards the related metal _manganese_;\r\nthe average percentage of which is in all cases less in the arid than\r\nin the humid region. The cause of this relation is altogether obscure;\r\nit is too frequent to be accidental.\r\n\r\n_Phosphoric Acid._—As regards that highly important soil ingredient,\r\n_phosphoric acid_, the indication in the table that there is no\r\ncharacteristic difference in the average contents in soils of the arid\r\nand humid regions, respectively, is doubtless correct. This substance\r\nis so tenaciously retained by all soils that there is no obvious reason\r\nwhy there should be any material influence exerted upon its quantity\r\nby leaching, or by any of the differences in the process of weathering\r\nthat are known to exist between the two climatic regions. Moreover, it\r\nis apparent that the average for the arid region is made up out of very\r\nwidely divergent figures; that of California exceptionally low (lower\r\nthan any of those for the states of the humid regions), while those\r\nfor Washington and Montana are exceptionally high. The latter is due\r\nto country rocks (“basalts”) showing abundance of microscopic crystals\r\nof apatite, which in some cases raise the contents of the soils in\r\nphosphoric acid to nearly twice the average given for the states.\r\n\r\nThe forecast that for most California soils, fertilization with\r\nphosphates is of exceptional importance, has already been abundantly\r\nconfirmed by cultural experience. Few definite data are as yet\r\navailable from other arid states, where fertilization is thus far\r\nsporadic and unsystematic. But it is predictable that in view of the\r\npresence of an excess of lime carbonate in the arid soils, and the\r\nunfavorable effect of this compound on the _rapid_ solubility of\r\ntri-calcic phosphate demonstrated by Schloesing, Jr.,[145] by Böttcher\r\nand Kellner[146] and Nagaoka,[147] fertilization with readily available\r\nphosphate fertilizers will be found necessary among the first, all over\r\nthe arid region, especially in view of the scarcity of humus in arid\r\nsoils. [145] Ann. Sci. Agronomique, tome 1, 1899.\r\n\r\n[146] Landw. Presse, 1900, No. 52; ibid. 1901, Nos. 23 and 24.\r\n\r\n[147] Bull. Univ. Tokyo, Vol. 6, No. 3. Production was diminished\r\nto less than one half when lime was used with bone meal, and actual\r\nassimilation of phosphoric acid to one fifth.\r\n\r\n    A curious instance of the effects of continued warm\r\n    maceration in rock decomposition is afforded by the\r\n    highly ferruginous soils derived from the black basaltic\r\n    lavas of the Hawaii Islands. These lavas, like the basalt\r\n    sheet of the Pacific Northwest, contain a large amount\r\n    of crystallized phosphate minerals, notably apatite and\r\n    vivianite. A correspondingly large proportion of phosphoric\r\n    acid is found in the soils derived from these rocks, up to\r\n    nearly two per cent.[148] But almost the entirety of this\r\n    substance is present in the form of an insoluble, basic iron\r\n    compound, difficultly soluble even in acids, and rendering\r\n    it wholly unavailable to vegetation. So that actually the\r\n    most pressing need of most of these soils is phosphate\r\n    fertilization. The same is probably true of some of the\r\n    highly ferruginous soils of California and of the Cotton\r\n    States.\r\n\r\n\r\n[148] See table, chapter 19, p. 256.\r\n\r\n_Sulfuric Acid._—From the absence of the leaching process in the soils\r\nof the arid region, we should expect that sulfates would be more\r\nabundant in them than in the soils of the humid. This is certainly\r\ntrue in the case of the alkali soils, which are characteristic of the\r\nregions of deficient rainfall. See below, chapter 22.\r\n\r\n    Hence the showing made in the general table, indicating that\r\n    sulfates are equally abundant in the soils of the humid than\r\n    in those of the arid regions, is surprising in view of the\r\n    efflorescences of alkali sulfates so frequently observed\r\n    in the latter. This is obviously due to the fact that the\r\n    majority of such alkali soils has, on account of their\r\n    local nature and usually heavy lime content, been excluded\r\n    from the comparison; which otherwise would have made a very\r\n    different showing.\r\n\r\n_Potash and Soda._—The compounds of the alkali metals potassium and\r\nsodium, being on the whole much more soluble in water, even without the\r\nconcurrence of carbonic acid, than those of calcium and magnesium, the\r\nleaching process that creates such pronounced differences in the case\r\nof the two earths must affect the alkali compounds very materially.\r\nComparison of the soils of the two regions in this respect shows,\r\nindeed, very great differences in the average contents of potash and\r\nsoda. For potash the ratio is .216 to .670 per cent on the general\r\naverage, and .187 to .670 per cent, in the average by states; for soda,\r\n.140 per cent to .350 per cent on the general average, and .110 per\r\ncent to .420 per cent in the average by states. For both, therefore,\r\nthe general average ratio is as one to between three and four for the\r\nhumid as against the arid region.\r\n\r\nIt is curious that an approximation to the ratio of one to two, or\r\nsomewhat less, is maintained in the average proportion of soda to\r\npotash in both regions; but this does not by any means hold good in\r\ndetail, very high potash-percentages being often accompanied by figures\r\nfor soda very much below the above ratio. This is the result of an\r\nimportant difference in the chemical behavior of the two alkalies,\r\nwhich has already been alluded to in connection with the discussion of\r\nthe zeolites. (See chapter 3, p. 38).\r\n\r\nThe process of “_kaolinization_,” being that by which clays are formed\r\nout of feldspathic minerals and rocks such as granite, syenite,\r\ntrachyte, etc., results in the simultaneous formation of solutions of\r\ncarbonates and silicates of potash and soda. These coming in contact\r\nwith the corresponding compounds of lime and magnesia, also common\r\nproducts of rock decomposition, are partly taken up by the latter,\r\nforming complex, insoluble, hydrous silicates (zeolites). In these,\r\nhowever, potash whenever present takes precedence of soda; so that\r\nwhen a solution of a potash compound is brought in contact with a\r\nzeolite containing much soda, the latter is partially or wholly\r\ndisplaced and, being soluble, tends to be washed away by the rainfall\r\ninto the country drainage. Hence potash, fortunately for agriculture,\r\nis tenaciously held by soils, while soda accumulates only where the\r\nrainfall or drainage is insufficient to effect proper leaching, and\r\nin that case manifests itself in the formation of what is popularly\r\nknown as “alkali soils;” namely those in which a notable amount of\r\nsoluble salts exists, and is kept in circulation by the alternation of\r\nrainfall and evaporation, the latter causing the salts to accumulate\r\nat the surface and to manifest themselves in the form of saline crusts\r\nor efflorescenses. Alkali lands are a characteristic feature of all\r\nregions of scanty rainfall, and are found more or less on all the\r\ncontinents. The substances composing the alkali salts are retained not\r\nonly in their soluble form, but by their continued presence influence\r\nprofoundly, in several ways, the processes of soil formation. A more\r\ndetailed discussion of this important subject is given in chapters 22\r\nand 23.\r\n\r\n_Arid Soils are Rich in Potash._—One of the most important practical\r\nconclusions flowing from the comparison of the potash contents of the\r\nhumid and arid soils respectively is that while in the former, potash\r\nis usually among the _first_ substances to be supplied by fertilization\r\nwhen production languishes, in the arid regions it will as rule come\r\n_last_ in order among the three ingredients commonly so furnished.\r\nAside from the water-soluble potash salts always forming part of the\r\nsalts of the alkali lands proper, which in many cases will alone\r\nhold out for many years under the demands of cultivation,[149] they\r\nrarely contain much less than one per cent of acid-soluble potash;\r\noccasionally rising as high as 1.8 per cent. That in such lands\r\npotash-fertilization is uncalled-for and ineffective, hardly requires\r\ndiscussion; while on the other hand, phosphates are commonly required\r\nfor full production after ten or fifteen years of cultivation without\r\nreturns. Nitrogen usually comes next in order, but sometimes is the\r\nfirst need.\r\n\r\n[149] In the light alkali lands of the southern California Experiment\r\nSubstation at Chino, the average content of water-soluble potash in ten\r\nacres amounts to the equivalent of 1,200 pounds of potash sulphate per\r\nacre. Outside of this the acid-soluble potash of the soil is .95%.,\r\nequal to 38,000 pounds per acre-foot.\r\n\r\n    The constant indiscriminate purchase and use of all\r\n    three ingredients, so urgently recommended by fertilizer\r\n    manufacturers because of their success in the humid Eastern\r\n    States, is therefore very poor economy for the farmers\r\n    of the arid region. Excepting cases of very intense\r\n    culture, _e.g._ of vegetables or berries, the use of\r\n    potash salts is but rarely remunerative, and therefore\r\n    uncalled-for, in arid soils for a number of years.\r\n\r\n_Humus._—The figures shown in the table for the average\r\nhumus-percentages in the soils of the two regions do not adequately\r\nrepresent the very important differences actually existing; partly\r\nbecause of the inadequate number of determinations made by the\r\nsame method (Grandeau’s), partly because of the differences in the\r\ncomposition, and especially in the nitrogen-content of this substance,\r\nwhich render direct comparison delusive. A detailed discussion of\r\nthe marked differences existing between the humus of arid and humid\r\nsoils in this respect has already been given (chapter 8, p. 135);\r\nshowing that the high nitrogen-percentage in the arid humus probably\r\ncompensates largely the lower humus-percentage, while rendering\r\nnitrification more rapid, because the oxygen is not consumed by\r\noverwhelming amounts of carbon and hydrogen; which, as is already\r\nknown, take precedence of nitrogen in the oxidation of humus\r\nsubstances. Nitrates are almost always more abundant in the soils of\r\nthe arid region than in those of the humid, sometimes to the extent of\r\ninfluencing injuriously the quality of certain crops, such as tobacco\r\nand sugar beets. Nevertheless, nitrogen is ordinarily, in the arid\r\nregion, the substance requiring replacement next to phosphoric acid.\r\nAnd when considered in connection with the small humus-content, so\r\nliable to burning-out, this places _green-manuring with leguminous\r\nplants_ among the first and most vital improvements to be employed\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n_The Transition (semi-humid or semi-arid) Region._—The sloping plains\r\ncountry lying between the Rocky Mountains and the Mississippi, quite\r\narid at the foot of the mountains, but with rainfall increasing more\r\nor less regularly to eastward, form a transition-belt between the arid\r\nand humid region of which but a small portion has been systematically\r\nstudied in respect to its soil formations. The analyses made of soils\r\nof the two adjacent states of Minnesota and North Dakota, have been\r\nplaced in the general table (p. 377) to show how far in their general\r\nrelations their soils correspond to the generalizations deduced from\r\nthe comparison of the decidedly arid and humid soil areas chiefly\r\nrepresented in the table. Although it has not been possible, for lack\r\nof detailed data, to eliminate the soils originating from calcareous\r\nformations, it will be seen that those of semi-arid Dakota differ\r\nfrom those of more humid Minnesota, almost throughout, as would be\r\nanticipated from the studies of the extremes, given in this chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nSOILS OF ARID AND HUMID REGIONS (_Continued_).\r\n\r\n\r\nSOILS OF THE TROPICS.\r\n\r\nWithin the ordinary limits of atmospheric temperatures, and in\r\nthe presence of adequate moisture, chemical processes active\r\nin soil-formation are intensified by high and retarded by low\r\ntemperatures, all other conditions being equal. We can usually\r\nartificially imitate, and produce in a short time by the application\r\nof relatively high temperatures, most of the chemical changes that\r\nnaturally occur in soil-formation. While it is true that the changes\r\nof temperature are nearly as great in the tropical as in the temperate\r\nclimates, these changes all occur at a higher level and within the\r\nlimits favoring bacterial and fungous action.\r\n\r\nThis being true we should expect that the soils of tropical regions\r\nshould, broadly speaking, be more highly decomposed than those of\r\nthe temperate and frigid zones, and that the intensified processes\r\ncontinue currently. This fact has not been as fully verified as\r\nmight be desirable, by the direct comparative chemical examination\r\nof corresponding soils from the several regions, owing to the want\r\nof uniformity in methods and the fewness of such investigations in\r\ntropical countries. Yet the incomparable luxuriance of the natural as\r\nwell as artificial vegetation in the tropics, and the long duration\r\nof productiveness that favors so greatly the proverbial easy-going\r\nways and slothfulness of the population of tropical countries, offers\r\nat least presumptive evidence of the practical correctness of this\r\ninduction.\r\n\r\nIn other words, the fallowing action, which in temperate regions\r\ntakes place with comparative slowness, necessitating the early use of\r\nfertilizers on an extensive scale, is much more rapid and effective\r\nin the hot climates of the equatorial rainy belt; thus rendering\r\ncurrently available so large a proportion of the soil’s intrinsic\r\nstores of plant-food, that the need of artificial fertilization is\r\nthere largely restricted to those soils of which the parent rocks\r\nwere exceptionally deficient in the mineral ingredients of special\r\nimportance to plants, that ordinarily form the essential material of\r\nfertilizers. Quartzose, magnesian, and other soils resulting from\r\nthe decomposition of “simple” rocks will, of necessity, be poor in\r\nplant-food everywhere.\r\n\r\n_Humus in Tropical soils._—Another inference from the climatic\r\nconditions of the tropics is that the _properly_ tropical soils are\r\nlikely to be rich in humus, as a result of the luxuriant vegetation\r\nwhich in the decay of its remnants must leave abundant humic residues.\r\nThis seems to be generally verified wherever the interval between rainy\r\nseasons is not too long; for otherwise, under the great and constant\r\nheat of the tropics a rapid burning-out of the humus, such as is known\r\nto occur in the arid regions, must also take place. A good example\r\nillustrating the inter-tropical regime as regards humus is given in the\r\ntable in chap. 8, p. 137, showing the humus-content of some Hawaiian\r\nsoils. Both are of the same order as in the soils of the temperate\r\nhumid region, though the nitrogen-content evidently can, consistently\r\nwith productiveness, range lower than has thus far been observed in\r\ntemperate climates. This again forms a striking contrast with the soils\r\nof the arid regions.\r\n\r\nIt is greatly to be regretted that not even approximate determinations\r\nof the organic matter, much less of the humus-substance proper, have\r\nbeen made by any of those who have analyzed tropical soils; excepting\r\nthose made of Hawaiian soils at the California Experiment Station.\r\n\r\nThe “loss by ignition” is of course always very largely water, mostly\r\nreferable to ferric hydrate and clay substance, the latter presumably\r\nessentially in the form of kaolinite. When, therefore, ferric oxid and\r\nalumina have been determined, we may approximate to the amount of total\r\norganic matter by making allowance for ferric hydrate at the rate of\r\nabout 14% of the ferric oxid, for kaolinite at that of 34.92% of the\r\nalumina found. Deducting these amounts of water from the total “loss by\r\nignition,” we may obtain at least an approximate idea of the organic\r\nmatter, and the probable availability of the nitrogen determined by the\r\nanalysis. See chapter 19, p. 357.\r\n\r\nWhile the continuous heat and moisture of the tropics concur toward\r\nrapid rock decomposition, it must be remembered that the copious\r\nrainfall is equally conducive to an _intense leaching effect_.\r\nStriking examples of this action occur in the Hawaiian Islands, in\r\nthe highly ferruginous soils resulting from the decomposition of the\r\nblack (pyroxenic and hornblendic) lavas that are so characteristic\r\nof the volcanic effusions of that region. The soils formed from\r\nthese rocks are sometimes so rich in ferric hydrate (iron rust)\r\nthat they might well serve as iron ores elsewhere. But these soils\r\nare very unretentive, and though very productive at first they are\r\nsoon exhausted, the abundant rains having sometimes deprived them of\r\nalmost every vestige of lime, and of most of the potash contained in\r\nthe original rock. At the same time the abundant phosphoric acid of\r\nthe original rock has been reduced to almost total unavailability by\r\ncombination with ferric oxid, just as in the case of the bog ore of the\r\ntemperate climates; so that phosphate fertilization is urgently needed\r\nin these lands, though showing high percentage of phosphoric acid.\r\n(Chap. 19, p. 356.)\r\n\r\nSoils highly colored by ferric hydrate occur rather frequently in\r\nthe tropics, and have received the general name of “laterite” soils.\r\nCuriously enough, the intense reddish tint mostly shown in these soils,\r\nand which is emphasized in the “terra roxa” of the Brazilians, and\r\nthe general “red” aspect of Madagascar, and of the Malabar and Bengal\r\ncoasts, is by no means always accompanied by markedly high percentages\r\nof iron oxid; but the latter is very finely diffused, so as to be very\r\neffective in coloration. The plant-food percentages of tropical soils\r\nare generally quite low, so that in the temperate humid regions such\r\nlands would be adjudged to be rather poor. Yet they mostly prove quite\r\nproductive and lasting, even without fertilization.\r\n\r\n    This is doubtless to be explained by the continuous and\r\n    rapid rock and soil-decomposition which goes on under\r\n    tropical climatic conditions, already alluded to; so as to\r\n    supply enough available plant-food for the demands of each\r\n    season’s vegetation, analogously to the proverbial “nimble\r\n    penny.” This is supplemented also by the rapid decay and\r\n    leaching-out of the ash ingredients of the rapidly decaying\r\n    and dying vegetation. Nitrification must likewise, of\r\n    course, be very active under the continual heat and\r\n    moisture, and the humus formed under these circumstances is\r\n    likely to be quite poor in nitrogen. On this latter point,\r\n    however, definite data are almost wholly wanting.\r\n\r\n_Investigations of Tropical Soils._—The most extended chemical\r\ninvestigations of properly tropical soils have been made by Wohltmann\r\nin his investigations of the soils of India, German Southwest and\r\nSoutheast Africa, and Samoa;[150] and by Müntz and Rousseaux of soils\r\ncollected under Government auspices in Madagascar. Leather, Bamber\r\nand Mann have also analyzed a large number of soils of India. But we\r\nfind in many of these cases a failure to specify distinctly the local\r\nclimatic conditions, and even the depth to which the samples have been\r\ntaken; so that the investigator is obliged to examine laboriously\r\nthe local climates, and especially the amount and distribution of\r\nrainfall, before being enabled to discuss intelligently the data given.\r\nEven Wohltmann, in his discussion of North African and Saharan soils,\r\nclasses these distinctly arid types among the tropical ones.\r\n\r\n[150] Samoa Erkundung, by F. Wohltmann, Kolonial-Wirthsch. Komitee,\r\nBerlin, 1904.\r\n\r\nAgain, the dry seasons intervening between the tropical rains, varying\r\nin length and from locality to locality, obscure somewhat the relations\r\nof the soils to the climatic conditions. Under the lee of mountains,\r\neven of slight altitude, we find xerophytic (arid-land) vegetation,\r\nas has been noted by many observers in Brazil, even near the Amazon;\r\nin Hawaii, in Jamaica, and in Madagascar. Unless, therefore, a close\r\ndiscrimination is exercised by field observers, many contradictory\r\nresults will appear in analyses of soils of inter-tropical countries.\r\nThis is naturally the case in India, where the topographic surface\r\nconformation and seasonal climatic conditions are so complicated and\r\ncontrasted. On the whole, the results obtained in Samoa, Kamerun and\r\nMadagascar seem, of those available, to be the most characteristic\r\nof true tropical conditions. In comparing these with the soils\r\nof low plant-food percentages in the temperate humid region (see\r\nchapter 19, p. 352), it must be remembered that those mentioned as\r\nbeing productive are so by virtue of great depth and relatively\r\nhigh proportions of lime; while in the tropics, the intense leaching\r\nprocess prevents lime from reaching any high absolute or relative\r\npercentages, save where limestone formations prevail. Moreover, the\r\nmode of preparation of the soil extracts for analysis by Wohltmann,\r\nand by Müntz and Rousseaux, differ so widely from that forming the\r\nbasis of discussion of soil-composition in this volume, that it becomes\r\nnecessary to make separate allowances in each case; since some of the\r\ningredients, phosphoric acid, lime and magnesia, are fully dissolved\r\nby the weaker treatments, while others,—_e. g._, potash—are not, and\r\nare therefore not directly comparable with the data obtained in the\r\nwriter’s work. The analyses made in India by Leather and others have\r\napparently been made substantially in accordance with the author’s\r\nmethods and may be considered directly comparable.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOILS OF SAMOA AND KAMERUN.\r\n\r\nWohltmann has investigated the soils of Samoa, notably those\r\nof the main island of Upolu, under the auspices of the German\r\n“Kolonial-Wirthschaftliche Komitee” in 1903, and gives the results\r\nof his observations and analyses in a report published at Berlin in\r\n1904. The analyses are quite numerous, but unfortunately are made by a\r\nspecial method which renders them only partly comparable with those of\r\nany other analyst.\r\n\r\n    Wohltmann’s method is this: “450 grams of fine earth (below\r\n    2 millimeters diameter) is treated for 48 hours with 1½\r\n    liters of cold chlorhydric acid of 1.15 density. Another\r\n    portion, designed for a fuller determination of potash, is\r\n    treated for one hour with the same acid, boiling hot. Potash\r\n    was determined in both soil extracts; the hot extract gave\r\n    from one-third to twice the amount obtained in the cold\r\n    extraction.”[151]\r\n\r\n    Wohltmann justifies this method by the statement that it has\r\n    yielded him results more nearly in accord with experience\r\n    than any other tried, both with tropical and European soils.\r\n\r\n    Under these conditions only a few of the determinations in\r\n    Wohltmann’s analyses are directly comparable with those upon\r\n    which the discussions in this volume have been based. The\r\n    figures for nitrogen and phosphoric acid may be assumed to\r\n    be fully comparable; that of lime will in general represent\r\n    fully only that which is present in the forms of carbonate,\r\n    sulfate and humate, and a part of that existing in zeolitic\r\n    or hydrous silicate form. Of the two potash determinations\r\n    only the one made in hot extraction will be even remotely\r\n    comparable, being probably at least 30% lower than would\r\n    have been obtained by the writer’s method.\r\n\r\n[151] Wohltmann states that the hot extraction sometimes yielded as\r\nmuch as five times more than the cold; but no such case appears in his\r\nreports on Samoa and Kamerun.\r\n\r\nEven thus, however, Wohltmann’s results are highly instructive. He\r\ngives the following summary of his mode of interpreting such analyses:\r\n\r\n    ==================+============+=======+=============\r\n                      | Very rich. | Good. | Inadequate.\r\n    ------------------+------------+-------+-------------\r\n    Potash            |     .2     |  .1   |     .05\r\n    Lime and Magnesia |    1.0     |  .4   |     .07\r\n    Phosphoric acid   |     .2     |  .1   |     .06\r\n    Nitrogen          |     .2     |  .1   |     .05\r\n    ------------------+------------+-------+-------------\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that the figures of this table differ materially\r\nonly in the matter of potash from those given in chapter 19, p. 354;\r\nfor the latter substance they would have to be multiplied by from 2 to\r\n4, according to the lime-content and other conditions.\r\n\r\nWith this understanding a number of Wohltmann’s analyses of soils from\r\nSamoa and Kamerun are given below, the potash determinations made with\r\nhot acid being placed in parentheses after the other.\r\n\r\n    _Soils of Samoan Islands._—A discussion of these\r\n    analyses shows, from the writer’s point of view, a very low\r\n    content of potash and lime, with the peculiarity that both\r\n    are somewhat higher at the depth of a meter than in the\r\n    surface ten-inches. This is probably to be accounted for\r\n    from the very high content of organic matter (humus), which\r\n    is apparent from the high “loss by ignition,” a very large\r\n    proportion of which must be credited to the burning of the\r\n    organic matter. That this humus reaches to the lowest depths\r\n    examined, is clear from the nitrogen-content given for these\r\n    samples. Wohltmann, whose estimate of these soils agrees in\r\n    most respects with the writer’s, attributed to them a very\r\n    satisfactory nitrogen-content. This would be true of the\r\n    total; but as he has not determined either the true humus or\r\n    its nitrogen-content, it remains uncertain whether or not a\r\n    sufficiency is in an available form, and whether their case\r\n    may not be like that of the Hawaiian soil mentioned above\r\n    (chapter 19, p. 362), in which despite 10% of humus and\r\n    .17% of nitrogen, the land was found to be nitrogen-hungry.\r\n    Again, as regards the phosphoric acid, which Wohltmann\r\n    considers satisfactory to high, it is questionable to what\r\n    extent it is rendered unavailable by the very high content\r\n    of ferric hydrate. We are thus left in some uncertainty as\r\n    to the real manurial requirements of the Samoan soils, which\r\n    doubtless represent very closely also those of Tutuila, the\r\n    chief American island of the group.\r\n\r\n    ANALYSES OF TROPICAL SOILS BY F.

They are also very rich in organic matter,\r\n    evidently down to the depth of a meter, as are those of\r\n    Samoa. It is probably due to the high humus-content that\r\n    these soils, washed as they have been by the second-highest\r\n    rainfall in the world (about 35 feet annually) have not been\r\n    as thoroughly leached as have been those of the Brahmaputra\r\n    valley. The annual rainfall of Samoa is only from nine to\r\n    eleven feet on the lower levels, but ranges as high as 18\r\n    feet at higher elevations.\r\n\r\nIt is noticeable that in most of these true tropical soils the content\r\nof magnesia is considerably above that of lime; a fact readily\r\nintelligible from the more ready solubility of lime in carbonated\r\nwater. It is hardly doubtful that this disproportion will in many cases\r\nexplain a lack of thriftiness, which could be effectually remedied by\r\na simple application of lime or marl, without resorting to the more\r\ncostly fertilizers.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SOILS OF MADAGASCAR.\r\n\r\nThe soils of the island of Madagascar have been analyzed to the\r\nnumber of about 500 by Müntz and Rousseaux, under the auspices of the\r\nFrench government.[155] So large a number of analyses should give a\r\nvery full understanding of the agricultural capacity and adaptation\r\nof so comparatively limited an area; unfortunately, we are here again\r\nconfronted by more or less imperfect data accompanying the samples\r\ncollected by government agents, and by the use of an analytical method\r\ndifferent from those of all other nations, and hence incommensurable\r\nexcept, as in the case of Wohltmann’s method, in regard to certain\r\ningredients.\r\n\r\n[155] Annales de la Science Agronomique, tome 1er, 1901, fasicules 1,\r\n2, 3.\r\n\r\nThe French chemists use nitric instead of chlorhydric acid; cold for\r\nphosphoric acid and lime, boiling-hot for five hours for potash;\r\nconsidering the remainder as of no practical importance. Since nitric\r\nacid is in general much less incisive than chlorhydric in its solvent\r\npower, comparison with the analyses made by other nations becomes\r\ndifficult. As in the case of Wohltmann, magnesia, lime, and phosphoric\r\nacid may be considered to be quite thoroughly extracted by the\r\ntreatment; while extraction of possibly available potash is doubtless\r\nvery incomplete. On the whole, however, the estimates of soil-fertility\r\nbased on percentages is very nearly the same as those assigned by\r\nWohltmann in the table given above. Like Wohltmann, they emphasize the\r\naxiom that the same percentage-gauge of fertility cannot be applied in\r\nthe tropics as in the temperate zones.\r\n\r\n_General Character of the Island._—The island of Madagascar, lying\r\nbetween the 11th and 25th degrees of south latitude, is quite\r\nmountainous in its central and eastern portion, where the coast falls\r\noff pretty steeply into the sea, leaving only a narrow coast belt of\r\nproperly agricultural land in the lower valleys and at the mouth of\r\nthe torrential streams. The mountains rise at one point to the height\r\nof nearly 10,000 feet. The western portion of the Island is much less\r\nbroken, has much plateau land with low intersecting ranges and streams\r\nof moderate fall, with considerable alluvial lands near the coast.\r\nThe rocks are almost throughout gneisses and mica-schists, which, as\r\nheretofore stated (chapter 4, p. 51), form mostly poor soils. There are\r\na few areas of eruptive rocks and tertiary calcareous deposits, and on\r\nthese the lands are much more thrifty. The rocks and red soils of the\r\ncentral mass, however, extend seaward almost everywhere.\r\n\r\nThe rainfall is high on the east side, where the moisture of the\r\nsoutheast trade winds is first condensed, the precipitation reaching\r\nten to twelve feet (120 to 144 inches) annually. The western portion\r\nis relatively dry, but rains fall more or less throughout the year;\r\nwhile in the eastern and central mountainous part there is a distinct\r\nsubdivision into a wet and a dry season. Here, while the rivers are\r\nlargely torrential, many large fertile valleys have been created by the\r\nheavy denudation of the mountain slopes. This is especially the case in\r\nthe Imerina province (in which the capital, Tananarivo, is situated),\r\nand here the valley soils are deep, and rich in humus. The western\r\nportion is but thinly forested. The soils of most of the island are\r\n“red” with ferric hydrate, resembling the laterite soils elsewhere; yet\r\nthe iron percentages are not usually very heavy, ranging mostly from\r\n4 to 6, more rarely to 10% and more, of ferric oxid. Most of the red\r\nsoils are clayey, crack open in summer and become very hard in drying.\r\n\r\nOf the 476 soils analyzed by Müntz and Rousseaux, 156 are from the\r\nprovince of Imerina, 56 from the adjacent province of Betsileo,\r\ntherefore 212 from the central, mountainous part of the island. The\r\nremainder are scattered around the coasts; the most productive being\r\napparently those of the northern end, Diego Suarez, which is mostly\r\nunderlaid by the eruptive rocks forming the mountain mass of Mount\r\nAmber, from which numerous fertile valleys radiate. The valleys of the\r\nwest coast also, in the provinces of Bara, Tulear and Betsiriry, have\r\nsome very productive soils.\r\n\r\nThe subjoined table, giving fourteen analyses selected as\r\nrepresentative from the mass of material presented by Müntz and\r\nRousseaux, gives a fair general idea of the character of the soils\r\nof the great island. It is at once apparent that lime and potash are\r\nextremely deficient in the soils of the mountain slopes of central and\r\nsouthern Madagascar, these substances having, as elsewhere in the humid\r\nregion, been leached down into the valleys; and the materials being\r\nmostly quite clayey, these valley soils have not, as in the case of\r\nthe sandy alluvium of the Brahmaputra, themselves been again leached\r\nof their mineral ingredients. Practically these valleys seem to form\r\nthe only profitably cultivable area of the central portion; while along\r\nthe larger river courses, such as the Mangoky, Ikopa, Mahajamba and\r\nothers, good alluvial “bottoms” and deltas form available lands. It\r\nseems to the writer that, in view of their own expressed opinion that\r\ntropical soils are not to be gauged on the same percentage-basis of\r\nsoil-ingredients as those of temperate regions, Müntz and Rousseaux\r\nrather underestimate the productive value of many of these lands;\r\nregarding which the field notes report good production, and the crops\r\nof which are certainly not the first that they have borne in the course\r\nof Malagassy history. It is as though their anxiety to forestall\r\noverestimates of agricultural prospects by intending settlers, had led\r\nthem to somewhat overshoot the mark.\r\n\r\n             ANALYSES OF MADAGASCAR SOILS BY MUNTZ AND ROUSSEAUX.\r\n    ======================+=================================+===========\r\n                          |             IMERINA.            | BETSILEO\r\n    ----------------------+---------------------------------+-----------\r\n                          |           CENTRAL MOUNTAIN REGION.\r\n    ----------------------+----------+------------+---------+-----------\r\n        Number of Soil.   |    4--4  |    115     |  71--4  |    272\r\n    ----------------------+----------+------------+---------+-----------\r\n           Locality       | Ambohitr-|  Ankazobe  | Ambohib-|Fandrandava\r\n                          |  omby.   |   North.   |   zaka. |  Valley.\r\n    ----------------------+----------+------------+---------+-----------\r\n                          | Red Soil.|  Ochreous  |         |\r\n                          |          |   Soil.    |         |\r\n    ----------------------+----------+------------+---------+-----------\r\n    Potash (K₂O)          |     .020 |    .006    |   .071  |    .017\r\n    Lime (CaO.)           |     .350 |    .060    |  traces |    trace\r\n    Magnesia (MgO.)       |     .022 |            |         |\r\n    Ferric Oxid (Fe₂O₃)   |    9.333 |            |         |\r\n    Phosphoric Acid (P₂O₅)|     .050 |    .032    |   .061  |    .267\r\n    Nitrogen (N)          |     .096 |    .027    |   .030  |    .020\r\n    ----------------------+----------+------------+---------+-----------\r\n    Remarks               |   Small  |Deficient in|No great |    Only\r\n                          | cultural | plant-food |cultural | moderately\r\n                          |resource. |ingredients.|resource.|  fertile.\r\n                          |          |May maintain|         |\r\n                          |          |vegetation  |         |\r\n                          |          |on account  |         |\r\n                          |          |of humidity.|         |\r\n    ----------------------+----------+------------+---------+-----------\r\n\r\n    ======================+==========+=======================+========\r\n                          | TULEAR.  |      MAINTIRANO.      |MAJUNGA.\r\n    ----------------------+----------+-----------------------+--------\r\n                          |                   West Coast.\r\n    ----------------------+----------+------------+----------+--------\r\n        Number of Soil.   |   253    |    261     | No. 267  |  343\r\n    ----------------------+----------+------------+----------+--------\r\n           Locality       |R. bank of| Plateau of |Village of|\r\n                          | Sakondry |Antsoamena. |Anhozorabe|\r\n                          | north of |            | South of |\r\n                          |Tongobory |            |Mandroso. |\r\n                          | Valley.  |            |          |\r\n    ----------------------+----------+------------+----------+--------\r\n                          |          |   Sandy    |          | Hill\r\n                          |          |   soil.    |          |summit.\r\n    ----------------------+----------+------------+----------+--------\r\n    Potash (K₂O)          |    .086  |    .015    |   .014   |  .012\r\n    Lime (CaO.)           |   4.180  |   trace    |   trace  |  trace\r\n    Magnesia (MgO.)       |          |            |          |\r\n    Ferric Oxid (Fe₂O₃)   |          |            |          |\r\n    Phosphoric Acid (P₂O₅)|    .083  |    .043    |   .011   |  .017\r\n    Nitrogen (N)          |    .075  |    .051    |   .039   |  .043\r\n    ----------------------+----------+------------+----------+--------\r\n    Remarks               | Potatoes,|  Manioc,   |Remarkable|Grasses,\r\n                          |  manioc, |  maize,    |  crops,  |  tall\r\n                          |represents|  beans,    |  manioc, | herbs.\r\n                          |  soil of |  peanuts,  |  rice.   |\r\n                          |  whole   |coco-trees, |          |\r\n                          |  region. |  mangoes.  |          |\r\n    ----------------------+----------+------------+----------+--------\r\n\r\n    ======================+==============================\r\n                          |       DIEGO SUAREZ.\r\n    ----------------------+------------------------------\r\n                          |         N.

While\r\ngneiss is not credited with producing first-class soils, its usual\r\ncontent of orthoclase feldspar should at least insure a respectable\r\naverage content of potash; but this, it will be seen, is mostly not the\r\ncase; and that of lime seems even worse, aside from the case where,\r\nas in some regions near the coast (especially in the west and south),\r\ncalcareous formations, probably of tertiary age, have contributed to\r\nsoil-formation. At some points there seem to exist phosphate deposits,\r\nwell known elsewhere to occur in such rocks, which impart to the soils\r\nexceptionally high percentages of phosphoric acid, even exceeding one\r\nper cent. The phosphates of course remain practically untouched by the\r\nleaching processes, and appear to be somewhat widely diffused; so that\r\nthe soils of Madagascar may be said to be, on the whole, well supplied\r\nwith this important plant-food.\r\n\r\nIn the central province of Imerina the valleys and lower slopes show a\r\nfair content of both lime and potash; but in the province of Betsileo,\r\nadjoining it on the south, nearly every one of the soils analyzed is\r\nreported as containing only “traces” of lime, together with very small\r\namounts of potash in most cases. The ultimate analyses of ignited red\r\nearths, of which an average is here given, are of interest in this\r\nconnection.\r\n\r\n    ULTIMATE ANALYSIS OF IMERINA RED SOILS,\r\n          IGNITED; AVERAGE OF THREE.\r\n\r\n         Silica        55.2\r\n         Potash          .3\r\n         Lime          trace\r\n         Magnesia       1.1\r\n         Ferric oxid   10.6\r\n\r\nIt is quite obvious that only leaching-down and concentration of the\r\nfeeble resources of such material in the valleys can produce soils\r\nworthy of permanent cultivation.\r\n\r\nOne point, however, is strikingly illustrated in several of the\r\nanalyses given in the subjoined table. We find in the original quite a\r\nnumber of cases in which the field notes report considerable fertility,\r\nwhile the chemists’ judgment is very unfavorable. Thus we find recorded\r\nfor the soil No. 267, taken near the village of Anjozorabe, in the\r\nMaintirano region, “luxuriant vegetation and remarkable crops,” with\r\nsuch minute proportions of potash, lime and phosphoric acid that\r\nthe authors are compelled to say that the land offers “no cultural\r\nresources.” The same occurs in the cases of soils Nos. 370, 261,\r\nand several others having either “good crops” or “abundant natural\r\nvegetation.” Unless we assume that in these cases the samples were\r\nnot properly taken, we are obliged to conclude that under the local\r\nclimatic conditions, such minute amounts of plant-food are developed\r\nwith sufficient rapidity to supply good growth. This would be quite\r\nparallel to the case of the tea soils of Assam, whose production lasted\r\n30 years before showing exhaustion, on plant-food percentages only\r\nslightly greater than those here noted, and determined by a much more\r\nincisive method.\r\n\r\nIt is thus quite obvious that a different standard of interpretation\r\nmust be applied to tropical soils as compared with either the temperate\r\nhumid, or the arid regions; and that uniform methods of analysis are\r\nneeded to evolve a definite rule from the present uncertainties.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SOILS OF INDIA.\r\n\r\nThe soils of India have been investigated to some extent by the\r\ngeological survey of India; by Voelcker, who went there on a special\r\nmission to investigate agricultural conditions; and since, more\r\nespecially by Leather, Bamber and Mann; and by Moreland. Leather’s\r\naccount is the most complete on the general subject and can best serve\r\nas the basis for a review of the entire peninsula.[156]\r\n\r\n[156] On the Composition of Indian Soils. Agr. Ledger, 1898, No. 2.\r\n\r\nAccording to Dr. Leather, “the four main types of soils to be dealt\r\nwith, and which certainly occupy by far the larger of the Indian\r\ncultivated area,” are: _The Indo-Gangetic alluvium_, covering the chief\r\ncultivable areas of the Indo-Gangetic plain; the _black cotton soils or\r\nregur_, occupying the main body of the plateau of the Central provinces\r\n(the Deccan) from the Vindhya range south; the _red soils_ lying on the\r\nmetamorphic rocks of Madras; and the “_laterite_” _soils_ which are met\r\nwith in many parts of India. To these should be added the _alluvial\r\nsoils of the Brahmaputra valley_, in Assam. It is hardly to be\r\nexpected that so large an area as that of India, with its diversified\r\ntopography, and a climate ranging from about four inches of rainfall in\r\nthe northern Panjab to the world’s maximum in Assam, and southward to\r\ntypical tropical conditions, could be even thus briefly characterized.\r\nThe observers have rarely given for the several soils analyzed, special\r\nlocal and climatic data, which cannot always be obtained from the\r\nofficial publications; so that it is not easy to discuss them from the\r\npoints of view of aridity and humidity.\r\n\r\n_The Indo-Gangetic Plain._—The general rain-map of India shows the\r\nPanjab and Rajputana to be arid throughout; thence eastward the\r\nrainfall increases to 25 and 30 inches on the Ganges; notwithstanding\r\nwhich, alkali (reh) is abundant about Aligarh, Meerut and Agra. Thence\r\ntoward Calcutta there is a steady increase of rainfall until, at the\r\nhead of the Bay of Bengal, 70 inches is reached.\r\n\r\nIf under these conditions the Indo-Gangetic plain admits of any\r\ngeneralizations as regards soil composition, it must be attributed in\r\nthe main to its predominantly alluvial character. It should therefore\r\nbe relatively rich in lime, magnesia and potash. So far as the first\r\nis concerned, Leather remarks that the only rocky particles larger\r\nthan sand to be found in all this large belt of land is the nodular\r\nlimestone called kankar, formed by the deposition of calcium carbonate\r\nwithin the soil, at the depth of a few feet. It occurs very generally\r\nin India, and as stated above (chapters 9 and 19), this occurrence\r\nof calcareous hardpan, of varying hardness, is almost universal\r\nin the arid regions. The analysis given in the table, selected as\r\nrepresentative from those given by Leather, show that the general\r\nforecast is realized in them, as soils of an arid region.\r\n\r\n

Brahmaputra Alluvium in Assam._—Aside from the immediate\r\nalluvium of the Indus, of which no definite data are available, the\r\nIndo-Gangetic plain represents the drainage of the _southern_ slope of\r\nthe Himalaya chain. That of most of the _northern_ slope is represented\r\nby the Brahmaputra, which not only originates in a region of heavy\r\nprecipitation—Thibet—but continues in the same throughout its course,\r\nand rounding the easternmost spur of the Himalaya range enters, in\r\nsouthern Assam, upon the region of the maximum rainfall known. Its\r\nalluvial deposits should therefore show the reverse characteristics of\r\nthose of the Ganges; they should, as thoroughly leached soils, be poor\r\nin lime, magnesia and potash. We have fortunately on this subject the\r\nexcellent work done by Mr. H. H. Mann for the Indian Tea Association,\r\nthe report of which was published in 1901, and contains, besides a\r\nlarge number of analyses, good descriptions of the general soil and\r\ncultural conditions of the Assam tea districts, with suggestions for\r\ntheir improvement.\r\n\r\nThe tea plantations of Assam are located almost wholly on the new and\r\nold alluvium of the Brahmaputra river, bordered on the north by the\r\neastern spur of the Himalayas, on the south by the low ranges of the\r\nKhasia hills. The soil is mostly quite sandy, the late alluvium gray in\r\ncolor, the older reddish and more loamy. Of the four analyses given in\r\nthe table and fairly representing the average character of these soils,\r\nthe two first are from the north side, the latter two from the south\r\nside of the river.\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that the prominent feature of all these soils is an\r\nextremely low percentage of lime, the general average being about .08%\r\nas against nearly 1.0% in the average Indo-Gangetic soils. In the\r\nlatter, potash ranges between .65 and .70%; in the Assam soils between\r\n.25 and .35. Magnesia averages nearly 1.3 in the Indo-Gangetic, against\r\nabout .50 in the Assam tea soils. It is thus apparent that the same\r\ngeneral facts as regards the leaching-out of soil ingredients already\r\nshown for eastern and western North America are strikingly verified in\r\nnorthern India; but reversed as regards the points of the compass. The\r\npreferential leaching-out of lime as compared with magnesia and potash,\r\nis here again well exemplified. It would be interesting to have an\r\nanalysis of the Brahmaputra water to compare with that of the Ganges.\r\nThat tea should flourish for twenty to thirty years in such soils,\r\nis a good indication of one cause at least of the total failure of\r\ntea culture in California, where tea plants are difficult to maintain\r\nalive, and after 25 years form rounded, scrubby bushes not over four\r\nfeet high. Similar failures of tea on calcareous soils are on record\r\nfrom India. The low lime-content of the Assam soils, then, does not\r\nnecessarily imply that these soils should be limed to maintain tea\r\nproduction. According to Mann, the main deficiency is in nitrogen, as\r\nthe figures imply; but whether his recommendation of green-manuring\r\nwith leguminous crops to increase the nitrogen-supply is practicable\r\nwithout first supplying more lime to the Assam soils, is questionable.\r\nSince phosphoric acid is also low, his recommendation to use freely the\r\nbasic or Thomas slag is doubtless a good one, since lime would thus\r\nalso be moderately increased.\r\n\r\nBamber gives a number of analyses of tea soils from low ground in\r\nAssam, which are very rich in vegetable matter and quite acid. Like\r\nthose reported by Leather, these “bhil” soils are very poor in lime and\r\nnitrogen, but fairly supplied with potash and phosphoric acid.\r\n\r\n_The Regur or Black Cotton Soils of Southern India._—The\r\nsecond-greatest reasonably uniform soil-area of India is that covered\r\nby the regur, or black cotton soils, in south central India, notably\r\nthe Deccan, where these soils are said to have been cultivated without\r\nfertilization for 2000 years and are still fairly productive.[159]\r\nBoth in their physical character, chemical composition, and cultural\r\ncharacteristics, these regur soils are very similar to the “prairie\r\nsoils” of the Cotton states and especially to the “black adobe” of\r\nCalifornia. Like the latter they are of unusual depth without change of\r\ntint; they crack wide open during the dry season on account of their\r\nhigh clay content; and the soil is thus partly inverted by the surface\r\nsoil falling into the cracks. To the latter fact Leather ascribes, in\r\npart, the long duration of fertility in the regur lands. The regur also\r\ncontains fragments of calcareous hardpan (here called guvarayi), just\r\nas in the Great Valley of California. The eighteen analyses of regur\r\ngiven by Leather agree so nearly in their essential points that it is\r\nadmissible to average them; two other examples are however also given\r\nin the table.\r\n\r\n[159] That is to say, they now produce about 600 pounds, or 10 bushels\r\nof wheat per acre, as do the Rothamstead soils after fifty years’\r\nexhaustive cultivation. Probably both have come down to the permanent\r\nlevel of production corresponding to the amount of plant-food made\r\ncurrently available each year by the fallowing process in originally\r\nvery rich soils. The present product of cotton on the regur lands does\r\nnot seem to be on record; judging by the wheat product it should not be\r\nover one hundred pounds of lint per acre.\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that while the contents of lime, magnesia and alumina\r\nare uniformly high, the content of potash has a wide range; it rises\r\nvery high (1.14%) in the maximum, while the average is fair.\r\n\r\nOne conspicuous defect of these soils is their extremely low\r\ncontent of nitrogen, in view of which their lasting productiveness\r\nis difficult to understand; unless it be that, as in California,\r\ntheir high lime-content causes a copious crop of leguminous weeds,\r\nconstantly replacing the nitrogen supply.[160] Unfortunately we have no\r\ndeterminations of humus or of its nitrogen-content. Leather attributes\r\nthe black color of the regur to some mineral substance rather than\r\nto humus; but his arguments are not quite convincing, so long as the\r\nGrandeau test has not been made. In view of the low rainfall and the\r\ncloseness of the texture of regur, it is probable that little if any\r\nnitrates are currently washed out of the black cotton lands.\r\n\r\n[160] See Voelcker, Report on the Improvement of Indian Agriculture,\r\n1892, p. 46, par. 60.\r\n\r\nThe regur soil-sheet seems to be underlaid over the greater part of its\r\narea by a basaltic eruptive sheet (not by metamorphic rocks, as stated\r\nby Leather), and it is not easy to conceive how such a soil stratum can\r\nhave been formed from such rocks as a sedentary formation. Elsewhere\r\nsuch soils are usually rather light and porous, as is the case in the\r\nHawaiian and Samoan islands; and very high in iron-content. The regur\r\nhas the character of an alluvial backwater or lake deposit; but how\r\nsuch a formation can have occurred on the Deccan plateau, is a question\r\nnot easily answered.\r\n\r\n_Red Soils of the Madras Region._—Interspersed with and to seaward\r\nof the regur lands there are in the Madras presidency considerable\r\nbodies of “red” lands, which appear to be sedentary soils formed from\r\nunderlying dark-colored, mostly eruptive rocks. Some of these are very\r\nrich in lime and potash, others very poor, and it seems impossible\r\nto classify them under any definite category either from the chemical\r\nor physical point of view, except as to their red tint. Even this\r\ntint, however, is not always found associated with exceptionally high\r\ncontents of iron oxid, but due rather to its fine diffusion in the\r\nsoil mass. As compared with the regur, with which the “red ” areas are\r\ninterspersed, these soils contain, on the average, less lime, potash\r\nand ferric oxid; and phosphoric acid is uniformly low. The alluvial\r\n(brown and black) soils from the same region, exemplified in the table,\r\nare doubtless derived partly from the regur, and their color and\r\ncomposition varies accordingly.\r\n\r\n“_Laterite Soils._”—These are defined by Wohltmann (Tropische\r\nAgricultur, 1892) as being “the characteristic sedentary soils\r\n(Verwitterungsböden) of the tropics, formed under the influence of\r\nheavy precipitation, high temperatures and drought.” This definition\r\ndoes not indicate their derivation from any particular rock, such as\r\nlaterite is supposed to be; but its definition puzzles even geologists,\r\nand so, as Leather observes, the definition of laterite soils will\r\nnaturally puzzle agricultural chemists. Accordingly it is difficult to\r\ndeduce from the analyses given any definite common characters. Leather\r\ndescribes those analyzed by him as red or reddish, sandy and gravelly,\r\nthe gravel or cobbles often incrusted with a dark-smooth crust of\r\nlimonite, which to the uninitiated looks as though the rock itself had\r\nbeen fused and vitrified. The samples from Lohardaga and Singhbhum show\r\nthe effects of these limonite crusts upon the composition of the soils,\r\nwhich resembles that of the Hawaiian soils mentioned above; but in the\r\nlatter the iron oxid is wholly pulverulent. But it is probable that, as\r\nin the case of the latter, the high content of phosphoric acid shown in\r\nthe statement (.64 for the Lohardaga soil) is tightly locked up in the\r\ninsoluble form of ferric phosphate. Wohltmann’s definition of laterite\r\nsoils seems best represented by the “terra roxa” of Brazil, which as he\r\nstates has .02 to.08% of potash, .02 to.10% of lime, and .045 to .10%\r\nof phosphoric acid. Humus and nitrogen are very deficient in all these\r\nsoils.\r\n\r\nWhile most prominent in the coast region of Bengal, they also occur\r\nnot only near Madras (Saidapet) but also in the belt of high rainfall\r\non the Malabar (western) coast of the Indian peninsula.\r\n\r\nThe productiveness of the laterite soils seems throughout to be only\r\nmoderate, yet much higher than would be expected of soils of similar\r\ncomposition in the temperate zones, where the rate of soil-formation is\r\nso much slower than in the tropics.\r\n\r\nFrom the analyses of “coffee soils” from Yarcand in the Sheveroy hills,\r\nnorth of Madras, we learn that coffee does well with a fairly liberal\r\nsupply of lime (.30 to.44%) and phosphoric acid, but is satisfied with\r\na much smaller amount of potash than is found in the tea soils of Assam.\r\n\r\nA farther systematic investigation of the soils of India, with\r\nsimultaneous accurate observations on their depth, subsoil, geological\r\nderivation, topographical location and relations to rainfall, could\r\nnot fail to yield very important practical results. The examination of\r\nsamples collected and sent in by persons unfamiliar with the proper\r\nmode of taking soil specimens, and the information which should\r\naccompany them, always involves a great deal of uncertainty and waste\r\nof labor, and indefiniteness of results.\r\n\r\n\r\nINFLUENCE OF ARIDITY UPON CIVILIZATION.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the facts given and discussed above, as to the\r\nrelative productive capacity of lands of the humid and arid regions,\r\nit becomes of interest to consider what influence, if any, these\r\ndifferences may have had in determining the choice of the majority of\r\nthe ancient civilizations in favor of countries where nature imposes\r\nupon the husbandman, who supplies the prime necessaries of life, the\r\nonerous condition of artificial irrigation.[161]\r\n\r\n[161] Verhandlungen der Deutschen Physiologischen Gesellschaft in\r\nBerlin, December, 1892; North American Review, September, 1902.\r\n\r\n_Preference of Ancient Civilizations for Arid Countries._—A brief\r\nreview suffices to establish the fact of such choice. Aside from Egypt,\r\nthe permanent fertility of which is ascribed to the inundations of the\r\nNile, we find to westward the oases of the Libyan and Sahara deserts,\r\nthe high fertility of which has become proverbial and has caused them\r\nto be cultivated from ancient times to the present. Similarly, on both\r\nsides of the Mediterranean Sea, we find that, instead of the humid\r\nforest country, it was in the arid but irrigable coast countries, such\r\nas the vegas of Valencia, Alicante, Granada, Malaga, and the even\r\nmore arid domain of which Carthage was the metropolis; and farther\r\neast, in the Graeco-Syrian archipelago and the adjacent coasts, that\r\nnoted centers of civilization were developed and maintained. Thence\r\nthe arid belt requiring irrigation extends from Egypt and Arabia to\r\nPalestine, Syria, Assyria, Mesopotamia and Persia, and across the Indus\r\nthrough the anciently recognized regions of Indian civilization—Sindh,\r\nthe Panjab, Rajputana and the Northwestern provinces—to the Ganges,\r\nembracing such well-known centers as Lahore, Delhi, Meerut, Agra,\r\netc., inhabited by much more hardy and progressive races than the\r\nhumid and highly productive tropical portions of the Indian peninsula.\r\nThroughout the extensive and important portion of northern India,\r\nirrigation is necessary to maintain regular production; and in default\r\nof it, periodic famines ravage the country. Thousands of years ago,\r\nmillions upon millions of treasure were expended there upon irrigation\r\nworks, as has again been done in modern times; yet in the rainy,\r\nforested districts we still find large areas practically tenanted by\r\nwild beasts. In Asia Minor, as well as in Central Asia, the remains of\r\nancient cities once surrounded by richly productive irrigated fields,\r\nare found where at present only the herds of nomads pasture. The\r\nKhanates of southern Turkestan with their historic cities, illustrate\r\nthe same obstinate bias in favor of arid climates. Similarly, in the\r\nNew World, it was not in the moist and exuberantly fertile forest lands\r\nof the Orinoco and Amazon, but on the arid western slopes of the Andes,\r\nthat the civilization of the Incas was developed. In Mexico, also, it\r\nwas the high central, arid plateau, not the bountifully productive\r\n_tierra caliente_, over which the Aztecs chose to establish the main\r\ncenters of their empire. Even to northward, the inhabitants of the\r\nhigh, dry plains of Arizona and New Mexico were, as their descendants\r\nof the Pueblos are to-day, superior in social development to their\r\nforest-dwelling neighbors of the Algonquin race. From time immemorial\r\nthey have practiced irrigation in connection with cultivation,\r\nmaintaining a comparatively dense population on very limited areas.\r\n\r\nIt might be thought that the desire to avoid the labor of clearing the\r\nforest ground was the motive which guided the choice of the ancient\r\nnations toward the cheerless-looking, treeless regions.\r\n\r\nBut if we consider the cost and labor of establishing and maintaining\r\nirrigation ditches, it certainly seems that a stronger motive, based on\r\nthe intrinsic nature of the case, must have influenced their selection.\r\nNeither can we with any degree of plausibility ascribe the preference\r\nfor the arid open country to the fear of enemies lurking in the forest,\r\nsince war was in early times practically the normal condition of\r\nmankind, and was waged with little hesitation wherever booty was in\r\nsight. It has also been asked how the ancients could have known of the\r\nhigh productive capacity of arid lands; but no one who has ever seen\r\nthe springing-up of luxuriant vegetation after the periodic overflows\r\nof the arid-region streams, or the same surrounding the springs in the\r\ndeserts, would ask that question.\r\n\r\n_Irrigation necessitates Co-operation._—Irrigation enterprises\r\ncan be accomplished in a very limited degree only by individuals\r\nor even families. Its permanently successful execution requires\r\nthe co-operation of at least several social groups, ultimately of\r\ncommunities and states, if it is not to give rise to acrimonious\r\ncontentions or actual warfare; witness the “shotgun policy” resorted to\r\nin the arid West in times not very remote. Irrigation, in other words,\r\ncompels co-operative social organization quite different from and far\r\nin advance of that necessary in humid countries. And such organization\r\nis manifestly conducive to the preservation and development of the arts\r\nof peace, which means civilization. The most ancient systematic code of\r\nlaws known to us is that of Hammurabi, the king of arid Assyria.\r\n\r\n_The high and permanent productiveness of arid soils induces permanence\r\nof civil organization._—In humid countries, as is well known,\r\ncultivation can only in exceptional cases be continued profitably\r\nfor many years without fertilization. But fertilization requires a\r\nsomewhat protracted development of agriculture to be rationally and\r\nsuccessfully applied in the humid regions, and the Germanic tribes,\r\nlike the North-American Indians, seem to have shifted their culture\r\ngrounds frequently in their migrations. No such need was felt by the\r\ninhabitants of the arid regions for centuries, for the native fertility\r\nof their soils, coupled with the fertilizing effects of irrigation\r\nwater bringing plant-food from afar, relieved them of the need of\r\ncontinuous fertilization; while in the humid regions, the fertility\r\nof the land is currently carried into the sea by the drainage waters,\r\nthrough the streams and rivers, causing a chronic depletion which has\r\nto be made up for by artificial and costly means. What with the greater\r\nintrinsic fertility and the great depth of soil available for plant\r\ngrowth, much smaller units of land will suffice for the maintenance of\r\na family in arid countries; a fact which is even now being illustrated\r\nin the irrigated region of the United States, where ten acres of\r\nirrigated land instead of 40 or 160, as in the East, form the unit.\r\n\r\nThe arid regions were, therefore, specially conducive to the\r\nestablishment of the highly complex polities and high culture, of\r\nwhich the vestiges are now being unearthed in what we are in the habit\r\nof calling “deserts;” the very sands of which usually need only the\r\nlife-giving effects of water to transform them into fruitful fields\r\nand gardens. It is also quite natural that the wealthy and prosperous\r\ncommunities so formed should in the course of time have excited the\r\ncupidity of the “barbarous” forest-inhabiting races, and as history\r\nrecords, have been over and again overwhelmed by them—a similar fate\r\noften afterwards overtaking the conquerors in their turn, after the\r\nCapuan ease of their existence had weakened their warlike prowess. At\r\nthe present time, the arid regions of the old world are still largely\r\nsuffering from having been overrun by the nomadic Turanians, whose\r\noriginal habitat—Mongolia and Turkestan—while also arid, does not\r\npermit of the ready realization of the advantages above outlined, on\r\naccount of the rigorous climate brought about by altitude. Mahometanism\r\nfirst expelled, and has since repelled, occidental civilization from\r\nthe arid regions of the Old World, remaining to-day as an obstacle\r\nto its progress. The peaceful aggression of railroads and telegraphs\r\nnow seems likely to gradually overcome this repulsion; and when\r\nConstantinople and Bagdad shall be linked together by the steel bands,\r\nthe desert will lose its terrors, and Mesopotamia and Babylonia will\r\nagain become garden lands, as of old, under the abundant waters of the\r\nEuphrates and Tigris. Until the water-supplies of the arid countries\r\nshall have been more definitely gauged, it is impossible to foretell\r\nto what extent food-production may be increased by their cultivation\r\nunder irrigation, after the relief from political misrule shall have\r\nrendered such undertakings safe. But it can even now be foreseen that\r\nwith improved modern methods of cultivation, the productive area of\r\nthe world can be vastly increased by the utilization of the countries\r\nwhere, as the Turcomans say, “the salt is the life of the land.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nALKALI SOILS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Alkali Lands and Seashore Lands._—Alkali lands proper, as already\r\nstated, are wholly distinct in their nature and origin from the salty\r\nlands of sea-coast marshes, past or present. The latter derive their\r\nsalts from sea-water that occasionally overflows them, or from that\r\nwhich has evaporated in segregated basins or estuaries; and the salts\r\nimpregnating them are essentially “sea salts,” that is, common salt,\r\ntogether with bittern (magnesium chlorid), Epsom salt (magnesium\r\nsulfate) gypsum, etc. (see chapter 2, p. 26). Very little of what would\r\nbe useful to vegetation or desirable as a fertilizer is contained in\r\nthe salts impregnating such soils; and they are by no means always\r\nintrinsically rich in plant-food, but vary greatly in this respect.\r\n\r\nWhile seashore lands are by no means always of high fertility even when\r\nfreed from their salts, especially when very sandy, it is otherwise\r\nwhen they occur near the mouths of streams or rivers, whose finest\r\nsediments they then receive. From such lands are formed the profusely\r\nproductive Polders of Holland and northern Germany, and the equally\r\nnoted “colmates” of France and Italy. These, so soon as freed from\r\nsalt, may be considered as possessing the same advantages as “delta”\r\nalluvial lands, and from the same causes; notably the accumulation of\r\nthe finest sediments derived from the rivers’ drainage basins.\r\n\r\n_Origin._—Alkali lands proper bear no definite relation to the present\r\nsea; they are mostly remote from it or from any other sea bed, so\r\nthat they have sometimes been designated as “terrestrial salt lands.”\r\nTheir existence is in the majority of cases definitely traceable to\r\nclimatic conditions alone. They are the natural result of a light\r\nrainfall, insufficient to leach out of the land the salts that always\r\nform in it by progressive weathering of the rock powder of which all\r\nsoils largely consist. Where the rainfall is abundant, that portion\r\nof the salts corresponding to “sea salts” is leached out into the\r\nbottom water, and with this passes through springs and rivulets into\r\nthe country drainage, to be finally carried to the ocean.[162] Another\r\nportion of the salts formed by weathering, however, is partially or\r\nwholly retained by the soil; it is that portion chiefly useful as plant\r\nfood.\r\n\r\n[162] See Chapter 2, p. 26.\r\n\r\nIt follows that when, in consequence of insufficient rainfall, all or\r\nmost of the salts are retained in the soil, they will contain not only\r\nthe ingredients of sea-water, but also those useful to plants. In rainy\r\nclimates a large portion even of the latter is leached out and carried\r\naway. In extremely arid climates, on the contrary, the entire mass of\r\nthe salts remains in the soils; and, being largely soluble in water,\r\nevaporation during the dry season brings them to the surface, where\r\nthey may accumulate to such an extent as to render ordinary useful\r\nvegetation impossible; as is seen in “alkali spots,” and sometimes in\r\nextensive tracts of “alkali desert.” Three compounds, viz. the sulfate,\r\nchlorid and carbonate of sodium, usually form the main mass of these\r\nsaline efflorescences. Magnesium sulfate (Epsom salt) is in many cases\r\na very abundant ingredient; some calcium sulfate is nearly always\r\npresent, and calcium chlorid is not infrequently found.\r\n\r\n    In some cases the above salts are in part at least derived\r\n    from the leaching of adjacent or subjacent geological\r\n    deposits impregnated with them at the time of their\r\n    formation. Such is the case in portions of Wyoming, Colorado\r\n    and New Mexico, in the Colorado river delta, and in the\r\n    Hungarian Plain; and it is in these cases especially that\r\n    the chlorids of calcium and magnesium also form part of the\r\n    saline mixture.\r\n\r\n_Geographical Distribution of Alkali Lands._—In looking over a rainfall\r\nmap of the globe[163] we see that a very considerable portion of the\r\nearth’s surface, forming two belts to poleward of the two tropics, has\r\ndeficient rainfall; the latter term being commonly meant to imply any\r\nannual average less than 20 inches (500 millimeters). The arid region\r\nthus defined includes, in North America, most of the country lying\r\nwest of the one hundredth meridian up to the Cascade Mountains, and\r\nnorthward beyond the line of the United States; southward, it reaches\r\nfar into Mexico, including especially the Mexican plateau. In South\r\nAmerica it includes most of the Pacific Slope (Peru and Chile) south to\r\nAraucania; and eastward of the Andes, the greater portion of the plains\r\nof western Brazil and Argentina. In Europe only a small portion of the\r\nMediterranean border is included; but the entire African coast-belt\r\nopposite, with the Saharan and Libyan deserts, Egypt and Arabia, are\r\nincluded therein, as well as, south of the Equator, a considerable\r\nportion of South Africa (Kalahari desert). In Asia, Asia Minor, Syria\r\n(with Palestine), Mesopotamia, Persia, and northwestern India up to\r\nthe Ganges, and northward, the great plains or steppes of central Asia\r\neastward to Mongolia and western China, fall into the same category; as\r\ndoes also a large portion of the Australian continent.\r\n\r\n[163] See above, chapter 16, p. 294.\r\n\r\n_Utilization of World-wide Importance._—Over these vast areas alkali\r\nlands occur to a greater or less extent, the exceptions being the\r\nmountain regions and adjacent lands on the side exposed to the\r\nprevailing winds. It will therefore be seen that the problem of the\r\nutilization of alkali lands for agriculture is not of local interest\r\nonly, but is of world-wide importance. It will also be noted that\r\nmany of the countries referred to are those in which the most ancient\r\ncivilizations have existed in the past, but which at present, with few\r\nexceptions, are occupied by semi-civilized people only. It is doubtless\r\nfrom this cause that the nature of alkali lands has until lately been\r\nso little understood, that even their essential distinctness from the\r\nsea-border lands has been but recently recognized in full. Moreover,\r\nthe great intrinsic fertility of these lands when freed from the\r\nnoxious salts, has been very little appreciated; their repellent aspect\r\ncausing them to be generally considered as permanently waste lands.\r\n\r\n    _Repellent aspect._—This aspect is essentially due\r\n    to their natural vegetation being in most cases confined\r\n    to plants useless to man, commonly designated as “saline\r\n    vegetation,”[164] of which but little is usually relished by\r\n    cattle. Notable exceptions to this rule occur in North and\r\n    South America, Australia, and Africa, where the “saltbushes”\r\n    of the former and the “karroo” vegetation of the latter form\r\n    valuable pasture and browsing grounds. Apart from these,\r\n    however, all efforts to find culture plants for these lands\r\n    generally acceptable, or at least profitable, in their\r\n    natural condition, have not been very successful.\r\n\r\n[164] See Chapter 23.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 60.—Alkali Lands in San Joaquin Valley,\r\nCalifornia.]\r\n\r\n    Figure 60 illustrates the usual aspect of alkali lands in\r\n    the San Joaquin valley of California. It will be noted that\r\n    the alkali-covered surface is only in spots, with clumps of\r\n    vegetation between, so that cattle can find both pasture and\r\n    browsing on a portion of such lands, even though the plants\r\n    so growing are not usually of the most desirable kind. We\r\n    find in all arid regions, however, considerable areas either\r\n    wholly destitute of vegetation, or bearing only such saline\r\n    growth as is rejected by all kinds of domestic animals.\r\n\r\n_Effects of Alkali upon culture plants._—In land very strongly\r\nimpregnated with alkali salts, most culture plants, if their seed\r\ngerminates at all, will show a sickly growth for a short time, “spindle\r\nup” and then die without fruiting. In soils less heavily charged the\r\nplants may simply become dwarfed, and fruit scantily. The effect on\r\ngrown trees around which alkali has come up, is first, scanty leafage\r\nand short growth of shoots, themselves but sparsely clothed with\r\nleaves. This state of things is well shown in figures 61 and 62, which\r\nrepresent apricot trees growing but a short distance apart, but one\r\ncoming within range of an expanding alkali spot. The characteristic\r\nsparseness of the foliage of the “alkalied” tree as compared with the\r\nadjacent one is well shown.\r\n\r\n_Nature of the injury to plants from Alkali._—When we examine plants\r\nthat have been injured by alkali, we will mostly find that the visible\r\ndamage has been done near the base of the trunk, or _root crown_;\r\nrarely at any considerable depth in the soil itself. In the case of\r\ngreen herbaceous stems, the bark is found to have been turned to a\r\nbrownish tinge for half an inch or more, so as to be soft and easily\r\npeeled off. In the case of trees, the rough bark is found to be of a\r\ndark, almost black, tint, and the green layer underneath has, as in\r\nthe case of herbaceous stems, been turned brown to a greater or less\r\nextent. In either case the plant has been practically “girdled,” the\r\neffect being aggravated by the diseased sap poisoning more or less\r\nthe whole stem and roots. The plant may not die, but it will be quite\r\ncertain to become unprofitable to the grower.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 61.—Unaffected.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 62.—Yielding to Alkali.\r\n\r\nAPRICOT TREES ON ALKALI GROUND.]\r\n\r\nIt is mainly in the case of land very heavily charged with common salt,\r\nas in the marshes bordering the sea, or salt lakes, that injury arises\r\nfrom the direct effects of the salty soil-water upon the feeding roots\r\nthemselves. In a few cases the gradual rise of salt water from below\r\nin consequence of defective drainage, has seriously injured, and even\r\ndestroyed, old orange orchards. The natural occupancy of the ground\r\nby certain native plants may be held to indicate that the soil is too\r\nheavily charged with saline ingredients to permit healthy root growth\r\nor nutrition until the excess of salts is removed. (See below, chapters\r\n23 and 26).\r\n\r\nThe fact that in cultivated land the injury is usually found to\r\noccur near the surface of the soil, concurrently with the well-known\r\nfact that the maximum accumulation of salts at the surface is always\r\nfound near the end of the dry season, indicates clearly that this\r\naccumulation is due to evaporation at the surface. The latter is\r\noften found covered with a crust consisting of earth cemented by the\r\ncrystallized salts, and later in the season with a layer of whitish\r\ndust resulting from the drying-out of the crust first formed. It is\r\nthis dust which becomes so annoying to the inhabitants and travelers\r\nin alkali regions, when high winds prevail, irritating the eyes and\r\nnostrils and parching the lips.\r\n\r\n_Effects of Irrigation._—One of the most annoying and discouraging\r\nfeatures of the cultivation of lands in alkali regions is that,\r\nalthough in their natural condition they may show but little alkali\r\non their surface, and that mostly in limited spots, these spots are\r\nfound to enlarge rapidly as irrigation is practiced. Yet since alkali\r\nsalts are the symptoms and result of insufficient rainfall, irrigation\r\nis a necessary condition of agriculture wherever they prevail. Under\r\nirrigation, neighboring spots will oftentimes merge together into one\r\nlarge one, and at times the entire area, once highly productive and\r\nperhaps covered with valuable plantations of trees or vines, will\r\nbecome incapable of supporting useful growth. This annoying phenomenon\r\nis popularly known as “the rise of the alkali” in the western United\r\nStates, but is equally well known in India and other irrigation regions.\r\n\r\nThe soil being impregnated with a solution of the alkali salts, and\r\nacting like a wick, the salts naturally remain behind on the surface\r\nas the water evaporates, the process only stopping when the moisture\r\nin the soil is exhausted. We thus not infrequently find that after an\r\nunusually heavy rainfall there follows a heavier accumulation of alkali\r\nsalts at the surface, while a light shower produces no perceptible\r\npermanent effect. We are thus taught that, within certain limits, the\r\nmore water evaporates during the season the heavier will be the rise of\r\nthe alkali; provided that the water is not so abundant as to leach the\r\nsalts through the soil and subsoil into the subdrainage.\r\n\r\n_Leaky Irrigation ditches._—Worst of all, however, is the effect\r\nof irrigation ditches laid in sandy lands (such as are naturally\r\npredominant in arid regions), without proper provision against seepage.\r\nThe ditch water then gradually fills up the entire substrata so far\r\nas they are permeable, and the water-table rises from below until it\r\nreaches nearly to the ditch level; shallowing the subsoil, drowning out\r\nthe deep roots of all vegetation, and bringing close to the surface the\r\nentire mass of alkali salts previously diffused through many feet of\r\nsubstrata.\r\n\r\n_Surface and Substrata of Alkali Lands._—Aside from the desert proper,\r\nin the greater portion of the alkali country “alkali spots.” _i. e._\r\nground covered with saline efflorescences and showing little or no\r\nvegetation, are interspersed with larger areas apparently free from\r\nsalts and covered with the ordinary vegetation of the region. A view of\r\nsuch country is given in a plate on a previous page. The alkali spots\r\nare usually somewhat depressed below the surrounding lands, and after\r\nrains remain covered with water for some time; the water frequently\r\nassuming a brown or blackish tint after standing.\r\n\r\nWhen a pointed steel probe is pushed down within such an alkali spot,\r\nit will usually be found that, although the soil may appear quite\r\nsandy, it is penetrated with some difficulty; while outside of the\r\nspots, the probe does not encounter serious resistance until it reaches\r\nthe depth of two or three feet, when it frequently becomes impossible\r\nto penetrate farther without the aid of a hammer. On the margin of the\r\nspots, the transition from utter barrenness to a luxuriant vegetation\r\nof native weeds is mostly quite sudden; as is shown in the figure, p.\r\n425.\r\n\r\n_Vertical Distribution of the Salts in Alkali Land._—The results of a\r\ncomparative examination of such land before and after irrigation,[165]\r\nare shown in the annexed diagrams; in which the kind and amount of\r\nsalts is shown for every three inches of vertical depth, down to four\r\nfeet, by curves whose extension from left to right indicate the several\r\npercentages, while the outer curved line gives the total of salts for\r\neach of the several depths.\r\n\r\n    Fig. 63 represents the condition of the salts in an “alkali\r\n    spot” as found at the end of the dry season at the Tulare\r\n    substation, California. The soil was sampled to the depth of\r\n    two feet at intervals of three inches each. It is easy to\r\n    see that at this time the bulk of the salts was accumulated\r\n    within the first six inches from the surface, while lower\r\n    down the soil contained so little that few culture plants\r\n    would be hurt by them.\r\n\r\n    _How Native Plants Live._—Fig. 64 represents\r\n    similarly the state of things in a natural soil alongside\r\n    of the alkali spot, but in which the native vegetation of\r\n    brilliant flowers develops annually without any hindrance\r\n    from alkali. Samples were taken from this spot in March,\r\n    near the end of the wet, and in September, near the end of\r\n    the dry season, and each series fully analyzed. There was\r\n    scarcely a noticeable difference in the results obtained. It\r\n    is seen in the figure that down to the depth of 15 inches\r\n    there was practically no alkali found (0.035%), and it was\r\n    within these 15 inches of soil that the native plants mostly\r\n    had their roots and developed their annual growth. But\r\n    from that level downward the alkali rapidly increased, and\r\n    reached a maximum (0.529%), at about 33 inches; decreasing\r\n    rapidly thence until, at the end of the fourth foot in\r\n    depth, there was not more alkali than within the first foot\r\n    from the surface. In other words, the bulk of the salts\r\n    had accumulated at the greatest depth to which the annual\r\n    rainfall (7 inches) ever reaches, forming there a sheet of\r\n    tough, intractable clay-hardpan. The shallow-rooted native\r\n    plants germinated their seeds freely on the alkali-free\r\n    surface; their roots kept above the strongly-charged\r\n    subsoil, and through them and the stems and foliage all the\r\n    soil moisture was evaporated by the time the plants died.\r\n    Thus no alkali was brought up from below by evaporation. The\r\n    seeds shed would remain uninjured, and would again germinate\r\n    the coming season.\r\n\r\n[165] Hilgard and Loughridge, Bulletin No. 128, California Experiment\r\nStation; Report California Experiment Station, 1894-95, p. 37; Bulletin\r\nNo. 30, Office of Experiment Stations; Wollny’s Forsch. Geb. Agr.\r\nPhys., 1896.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG 63.—Diagram showing amounts and composition of\r\nalkali salts at various depths in alkali soil, on which barley would\r\nnot grow. Taken September, 1894.\r\n\r\nTulare Experiment Substation, California.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 64.—Diagram showing amounts and composition of\r\nalkali salts at various depths in black alkali land, covered with\r\nnative vegetation. Taken March, 1895.\r\n\r\nTulare Experiment Substation, California.]\r\n\r\nIt is thus that the luxuriant vegetation of the San Joaquin plains,\r\ndotted with occasional alkali spots, is maintained; the spots\r\nthemselves being almost always depressions in which the rain water may\r\ngather, and where, in consequence of the increased evaporation, the\r\nnoxious salts have risen to the surface and render impossible all but\r\nthe most resistant saline growth; particularly when, in consequence of\r\nmaceration and fermentation in the soil, the formation of carbonate of\r\nsoda has caused the surface to sink and become almost water-tight.\r\n\r\n_Upward Translocation from Irrigation._—Fig. 65 shows the corresponding\r\nprofile of the same soil after several years’ irrigation. The upward\r\nmovement of the salts is clearly seen by comparison with the previous\r\nfigure; and the surface soil has become so charged with salts that the\r\nseeds of culture plants refuse to germinate.\r\n\r\nTen feet from this bare alkali ground, on which barley had refused to\r\ngrow, a crop of barley four feet high was harvested the same year,\r\nwithout irrigation. Investigation proved that here the condition of\r\nthe soil was intermediate between the two preceding diagrams. The\r\nirrigation water had dissolved the alkali of the subsoil, and the more\r\nabundant evaporation had brought it nearer the surface; but the shading\r\nby the barley crop and the evaporation of the moisture through its\r\nroots and leaves had prevented the salts from reaching the surface in\r\nsuch amounts as to injure the crop, although the tendency to rise was\r\nclearly shown. By the use of gypsum, moreover, the injuriousness of the\r\nalkali had been somewhat diminished.\r\n\r\nThe same season, grain crops were almost a failure on alkali-free\r\nland in the same region; and in connection with this result it should\r\nbe noted as a general fact that alkali lands always retain a certain\r\namount of moisture perceptible to the hand during the dry season, and\r\nthat _this moisture can be utilized by crops_; so that at times when\r\ncrops fail on non-alkaline land, good ones are obtained where a slight\r\ntaint of alkali exists in the soil. Actual determinations showed that\r\nwhile a sample of alkali soil containing .54% of salts absorbed 12.3%\r\nof moisture from moist air, the same soil when leached absorbed only\r\n2.5%—a figure corresponding to that of sandy upland loams.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 65.—Diagram showing amounts and composition of\r\nalkali salts at various depths in bare alkali land, where barley would\r\nnot grow; irrigated. Taken September, 1894.\r\n\r\nTulare Experiment Substation, California.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 66.—Distribution of Alkali Salts in Sandy Lands.]\r\n\r\n_Alkali in Sandy Lands._—In _very_ sandy lands, and particularly when\r\nthe alkali is “white” only, the tendency to accumulation near the\r\nsurface is much less, even under irrigation. In the natural condition\r\nthe salts are in such cases often found quite evenly distributed\r\nthrough soil columns of four feet, and even more. This is an additional\r\ncause of the lesser injuriousness of “white alkali.” An illustration\r\nof the distribution of the salts in very sandy lands, from the Tulare\r\nsubstation, is given in Fig. 66. Here we see that the maximum is not\r\n_at_, but some distance below the surface, the entire saline mass is\r\nlower down than in the more clayey loam of the same locality, and is\r\nmore widely distributed in depth.\r\n\r\n_Distribution of Alkali Salts in Heavy Lands._—The mode of distribution\r\nof alkali salts in the heavier, close-grained soil of the Chino\r\nexperimental tract in southern California, is illustrated in Fig. 67.\r\nThis land is permanently moist, from a water-table ranging from five\r\nto seven feet below the surface in ordinary years. There is therefore\r\nno opportunity for the formation of “alkali hardpan” as in the case\r\nof the Tulare soil; the salts always remain rather near the surface,\r\nviz. within twelve to fifteen inches. But being in much smaller average\r\namounts than at Tulare (an average of about 5300 lbs. per acre), quite\r\na copious natural vegetation of grasses, sunflowers, and “yerba mansa”\r\ncovered the whole surface, save in a few low spots.\r\n\r\nA similar mode of distribution of the salts is found in the still more\r\nclayey “black adobe” lands of the Great Valley of California. The\r\nscanty rains cannot penetrate these soils to any great depth, so that\r\nevaporation will soon bring the salts carried by them back to within a\r\nshort distance of the surface. Their accumulation there is frequently\r\nindicated by the entire absence of any but the most resistant alkali\r\nweeds, even though the total of salts in the land may not be very great.\r\n\r\n_Salton Basin._—A peculiar state of things is illustrated in the Salton\r\nBasin, which represents what was at one time the head of the Gulf of\r\nCalifornia, and at the lowest point of which, 268 feet below sea level,\r\nthere now lies a large deposit of rock salt. It has been cut off from\r\nthe present Gulf by the delta deposits of the Colorado river, which\r\nnow, however, overflows into the Basin at times of extreme high water.\r\nAlthough appearing level to the eye, the general slope of the country\r\nis to the lowest point of the former sea-bottom.\r\n\r\n    The region, now in progress of settlement by means of\r\n    irrigation water brought from the river near Yuma, was\r\n    investigated with respect to its alkali conditions in 1900\r\n    (Bulletin No. 140, Calif. Agric. Expt. Sta.). The annexed\r\n    diagram 68 shows the distribution of the salts to a depth of\r\n    21 feet. It will be noted that here also the alkali content\r\n    becomes insignificant at 4 feet depth, but increases again\r\n    to a second maximum at about 15 feet, below which there is a\r\n    second decrease; below this, at 20 feet, there is a final\r\n    very heavy increase, not only of the total salts but\r\n    especially of common salt, which evidently represents the\r\n    drainage toward the salt deposit. Above this level there is\r\n    a very remarkable predominance of Glauber’s salt (sodium\r\n    sulfate), also observable elsewhere, _e. g._ near White\r\n    Plains, Nev., whose name is derived from the copious surface\r\n    accumulation of the sulfate. It seems as though this must\r\n    have been formed in some way from the common salt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 67.—Amounts and composition of alkali salts at\r\nvarious depths and points in the ten-acre tract at the southern\r\nCalifornia Experiment Station; taken last week in April, 1895.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 68.—Graphic illustration of distribution of salts\r\nin Salton River section, California.]\r\n\r\n_Horizontal Distribution of Alkali Salts in Arid Lands._—The constant\r\noccurrence of “alkali spots” in arid lands shows at once the great\r\ninequality of horizontal distribution of alkali impregnation. This\r\nis as prominent in level lands as on slopes, and in extremely arid\r\nregions it is mostly not possible to recognize even very considerable\r\ndifferences without close examination. Thus in lands appearing exactly\r\nalike on the surface, on the edge of the Salton basin in California,\r\non the same forty acre 1.4% (56,000 pounds per acre) was found in\r\nthe surface four feet at one point, and a hundred yards away, 12.5%\r\n(500,000 pounds). The mapping of alkali lands is therefore somewhat\r\nprecarious unless carried into great detail. Moreover, it has been\r\nfound that the location of the salts changes from year to year,\r\nespecially in irrigated land, as might be expected. Those cultivating\r\nalkali lands have therefore to exercise constant watchfulness, unless\r\nthe salts have been definitively eliminated by underdrainage over\r\na considerable area; as merely local operations may be rendered\r\nineffectual by the migration of the salts from neighboring tracts not\r\nreclaimed.\r\n\r\n_Alkali in Hill Lands._—As a rule, hill lands themselves are remarkably\r\nfree from alkali, even in the arid regions; except when water is\r\ngathered in depressions, where strongly saline waters may be found in\r\nWashington, Montana and elsewhere. But on level plateau lands, where\r\ndrainage is slow or imperfect, alkali appears as freely as it does in\r\nthe same regions in the stream bottoms. In the latter the leachings and\r\nseepage of the uplands naturally causes a concentration of the salts,\r\nand thus we find alkali salts incrusting the surface in the valleys of\r\nthe streams, as _e. g._, that of the Yellowstone, Musselshell, Judith,\r\nYakima and others in the north, and of Green river, Platte, Pecos, and\r\nRio Grande farther south; as well as in numerous valleys of central and\r\nsouthern California.\r\n\r\n_Usar Lands of India._—These lands have been investigated first by\r\nthe “Reh Commission” appointed to investigate the causes of the\r\ndeterioration of lands in the Aligarh district (south of Delhi,\r\nbetween the Ganges and Jumna rivers), in 1876. The occasion of this\r\nappointment was the appearance of “reh” (alkali salts) in a region\r\nwhich had previously been free from them.[166] Subsequently, a more\r\nelaborate investigation of the subject was made by Dr. J. W. Leather,\r\nAgricultural Chemist to the Government of India.[167] From these\r\ndocuments it appears that “usar lands” exist largely not only in the\r\nNorthwestern Provinces and Oudh, but also in the Panjab, especially\r\non the lands bordering the Chenab river; likewise to a slight extent\r\nin the Bombay presidency. Leather’s investigation shows that not all\r\nthe lands designated by the natives as _usar_ contain soluble salts in\r\ninjurious amounts, some being simply lands having very hard, clayey\r\nsoils difficult to till with the imperfect methods employed. Yet the\r\ngeneral phenomena of the true “reh” lands are practically identical\r\nwith those of the American alkali lands, including also the calcareous\r\nhardpan, there called _kankar_. Owing probably to the long cultivation\r\nof the Indian lands (mostly under irrigation), the salts are there at\r\ntheir maximum in the first foot, decreasing as depth increases. It is\r\nnoteworthy also that in the majority of cases the predominant salt is\r\ncarbonate of soda or black alkali, which there as in California renders\r\nthe lands impervious to water until treated with gypsum. This fact\r\naccounts for the popular use of the same name for non-saline impervious\r\nclay soils, and the alkali or reh lands proper.\r\n\r\nWe have an entirely analogous case in the “Szek” lands of the Hungarian\r\nplain, some of which are simply poor refractory soils containing a\r\ntrace of soluble salts; while lower down in the valley of the Theiss\r\nwe find genuine alkali lands, both black and white, which have long\r\nfurnished carbonate of soda for local use and commerce. In this case,\r\nhowever, the alkali salts seen to come largely, in some cases wholly,\r\nfrom underlying saline clays whose salts in coming to the surface\r\nsuffer precisely the same transformations experienced in California and\r\nIndia, in presence of calcic carbonate (see below, p. 450 ff).\r\n\r\n[166] An abstract of the report of this commission is given in the\r\nReport of the California Experiment Station for 1890.\r\n\r\n[167] See Agricultural Ledger, 1897, No. 13; ibid. 1901, No. 13.\r\n\r\nThe accounts given by v. Middendorff of the nature and occurrence of\r\nalkali lands in Turkestan (Ferghana) agree entirely with those given\r\nabove for California and India; as do also the investigations made by\r\nother Russian observers on the saline lands of the steppes of European\r\nRussia.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPOSITION AND QUANTITY OF ALKALI SALTS.\r\n\r\n_Black and White Alkali._—Broadly speaking, the world over alkali\r\nsalts consist mainly of three chief ingredients, already mentioned,\r\nnamely, common salt, Glauber’s salt (sulfate of soda), and salsoda or\r\ncarbonate[168] of soda. The latter causes what is popularly known as\r\n“black alkali,” from the black spots of puddles seen on the surface of\r\nlands tainted with it, owing to the dissolution of the soil humus;[169]\r\nwhile the other salts, often together with Epsom salt and bittern\r\n(Magnesium chlorid), constitute “white alkali,” which is known to\r\nbe very much milder in its effect on plants than the black. In most\r\ncases all three are present, and all may be considered as practically\r\nvalueless, or noxious, to plant growth.\r\n\r\n[168] In this designation are included, in this volume, both the\r\nnormal (mono-) carbonate and the two other compounds, the bi- or\r\nhydrocarbonate and the intermediate (so-called sesqui-) compound or\r\ntrona; all of which are commonly present simultaneously, but in utterly\r\nindefinite relative proportions, varying from day to day and from\r\ninch to inch of depth, inasmuch as their continued existence depends\r\nupon the greater or less formation of carbonic acid in the soil, and\r\nthe access of air. Hence their separate quantitative determination\r\nat any one time is of little practical interest. All naturally\r\noccurring carbonate of soda contains, and sometimes consists of, these\r\n“super-carbonates,” according to the greater or less exposure to air\r\nand solar heat. They are much milder in their action on plants than the\r\nmonocarbonate, which unfortunately, in the nature of the case, always\r\npredominates near the surface, and thus injures the root-crown.\r\n\r\n[169] A wholly different kind of “black alkali” exists in some regions,\r\nespecially in the delta lands of the Colorado of the West and in the\r\nPecos and Rio Grande country in New Mexico. In these cases the dark\r\ntint is due, not to a humic solution, but simply to moisture, which\r\nis tenaciously retained by the chlorids of calcium and magnesium\r\nimpregnating the land, thus contrasting strongly with the gray tint of\r\nthe general dry soil.\r\n\r\n    =========================+=================+=========================\r\n                             |       EUROPE.   |               ASIA.\r\n                             |-----------------+-----------------+-------\r\n                             |      HUNGARIAN  |   ARALO-CASPIAN | ADEN.\r\n                             |       PLAIN.    |      PLAIN.     |“HURKA”\r\n                             |      “SZEKSO.”  |   SALINE CRUSTS.|“KARA.”\r\n                             +---------+-------+                 |\r\n                             |Debreczin|Kalocsa|                 |\r\n                             |         |       |                 |\r\n                             |         |       |                 |\r\n    -------------------------+---------+-------+-----+-----+-----+-------\r\n                             |         |       |     |     |     |\r\n    Potassium Sulfate (K₂SO₄)|         |       |     |     |     |\r\n    Sodium Sulfate (Na₂SO₄)  |     .2  |    1.6| 10.4| 18.2| 15.5|\r\n    Sodium Carbonate (Na₂CO₃)|   48.1  |   92.5| 14.7| 12.1| 69.0|  67.2\r\n    Sodium Chlorid  (NaCl)   |   51.7  |    4.4| 74.6| 69.7| 15.5|  32.8\r\n    Sodium Phosphate (Na₃PO₄)|         |    1.5|     |     |     |\r\n    Calcium Chlorid          |         |       |     |     |     |\r\n    Magnesium Chlorid (MgCl₂)|         |       |     |     |     |\r\n                             +---------+-------+-----+-----+-----+-------\r\n                             |  100.0  |  100.0|100.0|100.0|100.0| 100.0\r\n    -------------------------+---------+-------+-----+-----+-----+-------\r\n\r\n     =========================+======================================\r\n                              |               ASIA.\r\n                              |--------------------------------------\r\n                              |               INDIA\r\n                              |               “REH.”\r\n                              +--------------------------------------\r\n                              |       |Gursikar,|Jellalabad,|Bayamati\r\n                              |       |Aligarh, |Panjab,    |(Regur),\r\n                              |       |6 feet.  |1.5 feet.  |Deccan,\r\n                              |       |         |           |2 feet.\r\n     -------------------------+-------+---------+-----------+--------\r\n                              |       |         |           |\r\n     Potassium Sulfate (K₂SO₄)|  11.1 |         |           |\r\n     Sodium Sulfate (Na₂SO₄)  |   7.0 |    15.5 |      58.5 |   2.3\r\n     Sodium Carbonate (Na₂CO₃)|  79.0 |    56.9 |      22.9 |\r\n     Sodium Chlorid  (NaCl)   |   2.9 |    27.6 |      18.6 |  97.7\r\n     Sodium Phosphate (Na₃PO₄)|       |         |           |\r\n     Calcium Chlorid          |       |         |           |\r\n     Magnesium Chlorid (MgCl₂)|       |         |           |\r\n                              +-------+---------+-----------+--------\r\n                              | 100.0 |   100.0 |     100.0 | 100.0\r\n     -------------------------+-------+---------+-----------+--------\r\n\r\n     =========================+======================================\r\n                              |                  AFRICA.\r\n                              +--------------------------+-------------\r\n                              |             EGYPT.       |\r\n                              |                          |\r\n                              +---------------+----------+\r\n                              |     Trona,    | Alkali   |   Fezzan\r\n                              | (Commercial.) |L.

------------------------+-------+--------+-------+--------+---------\r\n\r\n_Nutritive Salts in Alkali._—With them, however, there are almost\r\nalways associated, in varying amounts, sulfate of potash, phosphate of\r\nsoda, and nitrate of soda, representing the three elements—potassium,\r\nphosphorus, and nitrogen—upon the presence of which in the soil in\r\navailable form, the welfare of our crops so essentially depends, and\r\nwhich we aim to supply in fertilizers. The potash salt is usually\r\npresent to the extent of from 5 to 20 per cent of the total salts;\r\nphosphate, from a fraction of one to as much as 4 percent; the nitrate\r\nfrom a fraction of one to as much as 20 percent. In black alkali the\r\nnitrate is usually low, the phosphate high; in the white, the reverse\r\nis true. Both relations are readily intelligible from a chemical and\r\nbacteriological point of view.\r\n\r\n_Estimation of Total Alkali in Land._—The investigations detailed\r\nabove having shown that in California at least, outside of the axes\r\nof valleys no practically important amount of alkali salts is usually\r\nfound at a depth exceeding four feet, it became possible to determine\r\napproximately the amounts of salts that would have to be dealt with\r\nwhen irrigation and evaporation should bring the entire amount to or\r\nnear the surface; a necessary prerequisite to the determination of\r\npossible cultures. While, as already shown, the salts occur lower down\r\nin very sandy lands, yet the diagram on p. 435 shows that even then, an\r\nestimate on this basis would not be very wide of the truth. It is at\r\nleast probable that the same is measurably true of level alkali lands\r\nelsewhere, when not underlaid by geological deposits impregnated with\r\nsalts.\r\n\r\nThe total amount of these salts ordinarily found in alkali lands (_i.\r\ne._ in such as in the dry season show saline efflorescences on the\r\nsurface) is from about one tenth of one per cent to as much as three\r\nper cent of the weight of the soil, taken to the depth of four feet.\r\nThe percentage of salts having been determined in samples representing\r\na tract, it becomes easy to calculate, approximately, the total amounts\r\nof each salt present per acre, on the basis of the weight of the soil\r\nper acre foot. For the soils of the arid region, such weight will\r\nusually range from three million five hundred thousand to four million\r\npounds per acre-foot; the latter being the most usual figure, of which\r\nit may be conveniently remembered, that forty thousand pounds represent\r\n1 per cent. We are thus enabled to estimate _e. g._ the amount of\r\ngypsum required to neutralize the carbonate of soda in the salts, or\r\nthe amounts of valuable nutritive ingredients—potash, phosphoric acid\r\nand nitrates—present in the land in the water-soluble form.\r\n\r\nAs has been shown in the preceding discussion, the analysis at the\r\nsurface foot alone, which has frequently been alone made, gives\r\nno definite clew whatever to the _total_ amounts of salts to be\r\ncontrolled. A _full_ estimate is of special importance in enabling us\r\nto forecast what culture plants are likely to succeed on a given tract,\r\nby reference to the table of “tolerances” given below (chapter 23, page\r\n467).\r\n\r\n_Composition of Alkali Soils as a Whole._—As may be imagined, the\r\npresence of the alkali salts finds expression in the analytical\r\nstatement of their composition, although not to the extent usually\r\nanticipated from their superficial aspect. The table annexed gives\r\nthe composition of fourteen alkali soils, taken to the depth of one\r\nfoot, at times when there was no visible accumulation of salts on the\r\nsurface. The averages of the several ingredients determined are given\r\nin the fifteenth column, and a comparison of its figures with those\r\nof the general table on page 377 of chapter 20 will show some marked\r\ncharacteristics. We find the average potash-content to be but little\r\nless than twice as great as in the general average for the state of\r\nCalifornia; in the case of lime the ratio is nearly as one to three,\r\nin the case of magnesia nearly one to two; in that of phosphoric acid,\r\none to two and a half, of which in the presence of carbonate of soda\r\nan unusually large proportion is in a readily soluble, often in the\r\nwater-soluble, condition (see preceding table).\r\n\r\nThe usual proportion of soda, of one-fourth to one-half of the\r\namount of potash, is changed to one-half or three-fourths; in the\r\ncase of the strongest alkali lands soda may equal or even exceed the\r\npotash content. As the latter, however, is invariably high to very\r\nhigh, it does not happen as frequently as might be supposed that the\r\nsoda content exceeds that of potash as shown by the usual method of\r\nsoil-extraction with water.\r\n\r\n    That the _potash_ percentage should always be high in\r\n    alkali lands, is hardly surprising when it is considered\r\n    that the continued presence of the salts resulting from rock\r\n    decomposition affords opportunity for the full exercise of\r\n    the preference with which potash is known to be retained in\r\n    soils by the formation of complex zeolitic silicates. In\r\n    most cases the potash-percentage exceeds .75%, and rises as\r\n    high as 2.0%; as is shown in the table.\r\n\r\n                COMPOSITION OF ALKALI SOILS AS A WHOLE.\r\n\r\n    (A) = White Ash, Fresno.\r\n    (B) = Wire Grass, Visalia.\r\n    (C) = Plains, Cross Creek, Tulare\r\n    (D) = Salt Grass, B.

But in the case of “white alkali,” more especially of the\r\nsulphate in moderate amounts, nitrification is exceedingly active and\r\nnitrates may sometimes rise to as much as 20% of the soluble salts. As\r\nalkali spots are usually low in the central portion and therefore more\r\nmoist than around the edges, we sometimes find ammonia salts in the\r\nmiddle of a spot, while nitrates are abundant along the margin of the\r\nsame. These differences, first demonstrated by an investigation made\r\nby Colmore,[170] illustrate some of the reactions that are essentially\r\nconcerned in the agricultural availability of alkali lands. A summary\r\nof Colmore’s results is given in the table below.\r\n\r\n[170] Report of the California Exp’t. St’n. for 1892-94, p. 141.\r\n\r\n_Cross Section of an Alkali Spot._—The spot examined lies outside of\r\nTulare, California, substation; it being late in the season, when the\r\nbulk of the salts is found near the surface, the samples were taken to\r\nthe depth of one foot only, at points four feet apart, from the center\r\nout.\r\n\r\n    AMOUNT AND COMPOSITION OF SALTS IN ALKALI SPOT FROM CENTER TO\r\n               CIRCUMFERENCE. 4 FEET APART, 1 FT.

The maxima of the “black alkali” and the soluble organic\r\nmatter (humus) coincide, as does that of the phosphate; the total\r\nmineral salts at the outer margin are only a little over half of what\r\nis found at the center. This is natural, as owing to the deflocculating\r\neffect of the black alkali, the center is nearly a foot lower than the\r\nmargin. The lowering of the nitrate-content at the outer margin is\r\nobviously due to the luxuriant vegetation growing adjacent.\r\n\r\n_Reactions between the Carbonates, Chlorids and Sulfates of Alkalies\r\nand Earths._ That a soluble earth-salt, such as the sulfate or chlorid\r\nof calcium, will react upon an alkaline carbonate solution so as to\r\nform an alkali sulfate, and _e.g._ lime carbonate, is well known; the\r\nneutralization of the sodic carbonate in the soil by means of gypsum,\r\nabove referred to, is based upon this reaction. It is not so well known\r\nthat the latter may be reversed, partly or wholly, by the presence of\r\ncarbonic acid in the solution of the soil. Although observed as early\r\nas 1824 by Brandes, and again in 1859 by A. Müller, this reaction is\r\nnot mentioned in text-books and attracted no attention as a source of\r\nnaturally occurring alkali carbonates which in the past have formed\r\nthe basis of extensive commerce from the Orient, until in 1888, the\r\nwriter together with Weber and later with Jaffa, investigated it\r\nquantitatively.[171] It was found that up to .75 grms. per liter, the\r\nentire amount of sodic sulfate present in solution is transformed into\r\ncarbonate in presence of calcic carbonate, by a current of carbonic\r\ndioxid; but the amount so transformed does not continue to increase\r\nbeyond about 4 grams per liter. A corresponding amount of calcic\r\nsulfate is formed. In the case of potassic sulfate, the transformation\r\nalso occurs, proportionally to the molecular weight. This relation is\r\nshown in the subjoined diagram, which also shows in the curves on the\r\nleft, the residual alkalinity left after evaporation and drying the\r\nresidue at 100° C.\r\n\r\n[171] Proc.

(The figures along upper line represent tenths of one\r\nper cent.)]\r\n\r\nThe corresponding reaction occurs also, of course, between sodium\r\nchlorid and calcium carbonate, but not to the same extent, because\r\nunlike the difficultly soluble gypsum, the reaction product is the very\r\nsoluble calcium chlorid, the presence of which in the solution limits\r\nthe reaction much sooner than when most of the decomposition product\r\nis thrown down in the solid state. The calcium chlorid not uncommonly\r\nfound in some alkali regions is undoubtedly the product of the above\r\nreaction.\r\n\r\nAs the saline solutions in the soil are mostly quite dilute, and\r\ncalcic carbonate is always present, it follows that whenever under the\r\ninfluences which favor the oxidation of organic matter in the soil,\r\nand the activity of the plant roots, carbonic gas is formed somewhat\r\ncopiously, alkali sulfates and chlorids present may be partially or\r\nwholly transformed into carbonates within the soil. As a matter of\r\nfact, it is found that this transformation occurs most readily in the\r\nmoister portions of the soil and subsoil, and _invariably so when an\r\nalkali soil is “swamped” by excessive irrigation or rise of bottom\r\nwater_; while the reaction is again reversed whenever free access of\r\nair reduces the carbonic dioxid below a certain point. It thus becomes\r\nintelligible why in the diagrams showing the distribution of the salts\r\n(this chapter pp. 431 and 432), we always find the sodic carbonate\r\nrelatively _decreasing_ as the surface is approached.\r\n\r\nThus, also, is explained the fact that sodium carbonate is formed more\r\nabundantly toward the center of the root system of alkali plants, such\r\nas the greasewood, beneath which the soil is always more abundantly\r\ncharged with “black alkali” than is the surrounding earth.\r\n\r\nGood aeration of the soil mass, then, is essential in maintaining the\r\nneutralization of the “black alkali” soils brought about by the use of\r\ngypsum (land plaster).\r\n\r\n_Inverse Ratios of Alkali Carbonates and Sulfates._—According to the\r\nabove considerations, it is not surprising that we should often find\r\nan apparent inverse ratio between the alkali sulfates and carbonates\r\nin soils so closely adjacent that their salts must be presumed to be\r\nsimilar in composition. A striking example is shown in fig. 70, in\r\nwhich this inverse ratio becomes apparent four times in succession in\r\none and the same soil profile. While this inference is plain on the\r\nface of the diagram, it is not quite easy to explain in detail how\r\nthis alternation came about from the condition observed two months\r\npreviously. Most probably it was caused by corresponding alternations\r\nof weather, in which short, warm spring showers alternated with\r\nsimilarly brief periods of drying north winds; the latter causing a\r\nreversal of the formation of sodic carbonate that had been induced by\r\nthe former.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 70.—Amounts and Composition of Alkali Salts at\r\nvarious depths in partly reclaimed Alkali Land. Tulare Experiment\r\nSubstation, California.]\r\n\r\n_Exceptional Conditions._—While the phenomena of alkali lands as\r\noutlined above probably represent the vastly predominant conditions\r\non level lands, yet there are exceptions due to surface conformation,\r\nand the local existence of sources of alkali salts outside of the soil\r\nitself. Such is the case where salts ooze out of strata cropping out on\r\nhillsides, as at some points in the San Joaquin Valley in California,\r\nand in parts of New Mexico, Colorado and Wyoming; also where, as in\r\nthe Hungarian plain, saline clays underlie within reach of surface\r\nevaporation.\r\n\r\nAgain, it not infrequently happens that in sloping valleys or basins,\r\nwhere the central (lowest) portion receives the salts leached out of\r\nthe soils of the adjacent slopes, we find belts of greater or less\r\nwidth in which the alkali impregnation may reach to the depth of\r\nten or twelve feet, usually within more or less definite layers of\r\ncalcareous hardpan, likewise the outcome of the leaching of the valley\r\nslopes. Such areas, however, are usually quite limited, and are at\r\npresent scarcely reclaimable without excessive expenditure; the more\r\nas they are often underlaid by saline bottom water. In these cases\r\nthe predominant saline ingredient is usually common salt, as might be\r\nexpected and as is exemplified in the Great Salt Lake of Utah, in the\r\nAntelope and Perris Valleys, and in Salton basin in California; in\r\nthe Yellowstone valley near Billings, Mont.[172] in the Aralo-Caspian\r\ndesert, and at many other points.\r\n\r\n[172] Farmer’s Bull. No. 88, U. S. Dept. Agr., 1899.\r\n\r\n_Conclusions._—Summing up the conclusions from the foregoing facts and\r\nconsiderations, we find that—\r\n\r\n(1) The amount of soluble salts in alkali lands is usually limited;\r\nthey are not ordinarily supplied in indefinite quantities from the\r\nbottom-water below. These salts have mostly been formed by weathering\r\nin the soil-layer itself.\r\n\r\n(2) The salts move up and down within the upper four or five feet\r\nof the soil and subsoil, following the movement of the moisture;\r\ndescending in the rainy season to the limit of the annual moistening\r\nas a maximum, and then reascending or not, according as surface\r\nevaporation may demand. At the end of the dry season, in untilled\r\nirrigated land, practically the entire mass of salts may be within six\r\nor eight inches of the surface.\r\n\r\n(3) The direct injury to vegetation[173] is caused largely within a\r\nfew inches of the surface, by the corrosion of the bark, usually near\r\nthe root crown. This corrosion is strongest when carbonate of soda\r\n(salsoda) forms a large proportion of the salts; the soda then also\r\ndissolves the vegetable mold and causes blackish spots in the soil,\r\npopularly known as black alkali.\r\n\r\n[173] For a general statement and discussion of the physiological\r\neffects of saline solutions on plants, see chapter 26.\r\n\r\n(4) The injury caused by carbonate of soda is aggravated by its action\r\nin puddling the soil so as to cause it to lose its crumbly or flaky\r\ncondition, rendering it almost or quite untillable and impervious. It\r\nalso tends to form in the depths of the soil-layer a tough, impervious\r\nhardpan, which yields neither to plow, pick, nor crowbar. Its presence\r\nis easily ascertained by means of a pointed steel sounding-rod.\r\n\r\n(5) While alkali lands share with other soils of the arid region the\r\nadvantage of unusually high percentages of plant-food in the insoluble\r\nform, they also contain, alongside of the noxious salts, considerable\r\namounts of water-soluble plant-food. When, therefore, the action of the\r\nnoxious salts is done away with, they should be profusely and lastingly\r\nproductive; particularly as they are always naturally somewhat moist\r\nin consequence of the attraction of moisture by the salts, and are\r\ntherefore less liable to injury from drought than the same soils when\r\nfree from alkali.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nUTILIZATION AND RECLAMATION OF ALKALI LANDS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Alkali-Resistant Crops._—The most obvious mode of utilizing alkali\r\nlands is to occupy them with crops not affected by the noxious salts.\r\nUnfortunately but few such crops of general utility have as yet been\r\nfound for the stronger class of alkali lands. The question is always\r\none of degree, which frequently cannot be decided without an actual\r\ndetermination of the amount and kind of salts to be dealt with, to\r\nwhich the crops can then be adapted in accordance with the greater\r\nor less sensitiveness of the several plants, as indicated in the\r\ntable of tolerances given farther on. But aside from this, there are\r\ncertain general measures and precautions which in any case will serve\r\nto mitigate the effect of the alkali salts. Foremost among these, and\r\napplicable everywhere, is the prevention of evaporation to the utmost\r\nextent possible.\r\n\r\n_Counteracting Evaporation._—Since evaporation of the soil-moisture\r\nat the surface is what brings the alkali to the level where the\r\nmain injury to plants occurs, it is obvious that evaporation should\r\nbe prevented as much as possible. This is the more important, as\r\nthe saving of soil-moisture, and therefore of irrigation water, is\r\nattainable by the same means.\r\n\r\nThree methods for this purpose are usually practiced, viz., shading,\r\nmulching, and the maintenance of loose tilth in the surface soil to\r\nsuch depth as may be required by the climatic conditions.\r\n\r\nAs to mulching, it is already well recognized in the alkali regions\r\nof California as an effective remedy in light cases. Fruit trees are\r\nfrequently thus protected, particularly while young, after which their\r\nshade alone may (as in the case of low-trained orange trees) suffice\r\nto prevent injury. The same often happens in the case of low-trained\r\nvines, small-fruit, and vegetables. Sanding of the surface to the depth\r\nof several inches was among the first attempts in this direction; but\r\nthe necessity of cultivation, involving the renewal of the sand each\r\nseason, renders this a costly method. Straw, leaves, and manure have\r\nbeen more successfully used; but even these, unless employed for the\r\npurpose of fertilization, involve more expense and trouble than the\r\nsimple _maintenance of very loose tilth of the surface soil throughout\r\nthe dry season_; a remedy which, of course, is equally applicable to\r\nhoed field crops, and is in the case of some of these—_e. g._, cotton—a\r\nnecessary condition of cultural success everywhere. The wide prevalence\r\nof “light” soils in the arid regions, from causes inherent in the\r\nclimate itself, renders this condition relatively easy of fulfilment.\r\n\r\n_Turning-under of Surface Alkali._—Aside, however, from the mere\r\nprevention of surface evaporation, another favorable condition is\r\nrealized by this procedure, namely the commingling of the heavily\r\nsalt-charged surface-layers with the relatively non-alkaline subsoil.\r\nSince in the arid regions the roots of all plants retire farther\r\nfrom the surface because of the deadly drought and heat of summer,\r\nit is usually possible to cultivate deeper than could safely be done\r\nwith growing crops in humid climates. Yet even there, the maxim of\r\n“deep preparation and shallow cultivation” is put into practice with\r\nadvantage, only changing the measurements of depth to correspond with\r\nthe altered climatic conditions. Thus while in the humid States, three\r\nto four inches is the accepted standard of depth for summer cultivation\r\nto preserve moisture without injury to the roots, that depth must in\r\nthe arid region frequently be doubled in order to be effective; and\r\nwill even then scarcely touch a living root in orchards and vineyards,\r\nparticularly in unmanured and unirrigated land.\r\n\r\nA glance at fig. 63, (chap. 22, p. 431), will show the great advantage\r\nof extra-deep preparation in commingling the alkali salts accumulated\r\nnear the surface with the lower soil-layers, diffusing the salts, say\r\nthrough twelve instead of six inches of soil mass. This will in very\r\nmany cases suffice to render the growth of ordinary crops possible if,\r\nby subsequent frequent and thorough cultivation, surface evaporation,\r\nand with it the re-ascent of the salts to the surface, is prevented.\r\n\r\nA striking example of the efficiency of this mode of procedure was\r\nobserved at the Tulare substation, California, where a portion of a\r\nvery bad alkali spot was trenched to the depth of two feet, throwing\r\nthe surface soil to the bottom. The spot thus treated produced\r\nexcellent wheat crops for two years—the time it took the alkali salts\r\nto reascend to the surface.\r\n\r\nIt should therefore be kept in mind that whatever else is done toward\r\nreclamation, _deep preparation and thorough cultivation_ must be\r\nregarded as prime factors for the maintenance of production on alkali\r\nlands.\r\n\r\n_The Efficacy of Shading_, already referred to, is strikingly\r\nillustrated in the case of some field crops which, when once\r\nestablished, will thrive on fairly strong alkali soil, provided that\r\na good thick “stand” has once been obtained. This is notably true\r\nof the great forage crop of the arid region, alfalfa or lucern. Its\r\nseed is extremely sensitive to “black” alkali, and will decay in the\r\nground unless protected against it by the use of gypsum in sowing. But\r\nwhen once a full stand has been obtained, the field may endure for\r\nmany years without a sign of injury. Here two effects combine, viz.,\r\nthe shading, and the evaporation through the deep roots and abundant\r\nfoliage, which alone prevents, in a large measure, the ascent of the\r\nmoisture and salts to the surface. The case is then precisely parallel\r\nto that of the natural soil (see p. 432, chapter 22), except that, as\r\nirrigation is practiced in order to stimulate production, the sheet of\r\nalkali hardpan will be dissolved and its salts spread through the soil\r\nmore evenly. The result is that so soon as the alfalfa is taken off the\r\nground and the cultivation of other crops is attempted, an altogether\r\nunexpectedly large amount of alkali comes to the surface and greatly\r\nimpedes, if it does not altogether prevent, the immediate planting of\r\nother crops. Shallow-rooted annual crops that give but little shade,\r\nlike the cereals, while measurably impeding the rise of the salts\r\nduring their growth (see fig. 70, page 452) frequently allow of enough\r\nrise after harvest to prevent reseeding the following season.\r\n\r\n_“Neutralising” Black Alkali._—Since so little carbonate of soda\r\nas one-tenth of one per cent may suffice to render some soils\r\nuncultivable, it frequently happens that its mere transformation into\r\nthe sulfate is sufficient to remove all stress from alkali. Gypsum\r\n(land plaster) is the cheap and effective agent to bring about this\r\ntransformation, provided water be also present. The amount required\r\nper acre will, of course, vary with the amount of salts in the soil,\r\nall the way from a few hundred pounds to several tons in the case of\r\nstrong alkali spots; but it is not usually necessary to add the entire\r\nquantity at once, provided that sufficient be used to neutralize the\r\nsodic carbonate near the surface, and enough time be allowed for the\r\naction to take place. In very wet soil, and when much gypsum is used,\r\nthis may occur within a few days; in merely damp soils in the course of\r\nmonths; but usually the effect increases for years, as the salts rise\r\nfrom below.\r\n\r\nThe effect of gypsum on black-alkali land is often very striking,\r\neven to the eye. The blackish puddles and spots disappear, because\r\nthe gypsum renders the dissolved humus insoluble and thus restores it\r\nto the soil. The latter soon loses its hard, puddled condition and\r\ncrumbles and bulges into a loose mass, into which water now soaks\r\nfreely, bringing up the previously depressed spots to the general level\r\nof the land. On the surface thus changed, seeds now germinate and grow\r\nwithout hindrance; and as the injury from alkali occurs at or near the\r\nsurface, it is usually best to simply harrow in the plaster, leaving\r\nthe water to carry it down in solution. Soluble phosphates present\r\nare decomposed so as to retain finely divided, but less soluble earth\r\nphosphates in the soil.\r\n\r\nIt must not be forgotten that this beneficial change may go backward\r\nif the land thus treated is permitted to be swamped by irrigation\r\nwater or otherwise. Under the same conditions naturally white alkali\r\nmay turn black (see above, chapter 22, p. 451). Of course, gypsum is\r\nof no benefit whatever on soils containing no “black” alkali, but only\r\n(“white”) Glauber’s and common salt.\r\n\r\n_Removing the Salts from the Soil._—In case the amount of salts in\r\nthe soil should be so great that even the change worked by gypsum is\r\ninsufficient to render it available for useful crops, the only remedy\r\nleft is to remove the salts, partially or wholly, at least from the\r\n_surface_ of the land. Three chief methods are available for this\r\npurpose. One is to remove the salts, with more or less earth, from the\r\nsurface at the end of the dry season, either by sweeping or by means of\r\na horse scraper set so as to carry off a certain depth of soil. Thus\r\nsometimes in a single season one-third or one-half of the total salts\r\nmay be got rid of, the loss of a few inches of surface soil being of\r\nlittle moment in the deep soils of the arid region. Another method\r\naffording partial relief is to flood the land for a sufficient length\r\nof time to carry the alkali three or more feet below the surface, then\r\ncarefully preventing its re-ascent by suppressing evaporation (see this\r\nchapter, p. 455) as much as possible. The best of all, the final and\r\nuniversally efficient remedy, is to leach the alkali salt out of the\r\nsoil into the country drainage; supplementing by irrigation water what\r\nis left undone by the deficient rainfall.\r\n\r\nIt is not practicable, as many suppose, to wash the salts off the\r\nsurface by a rush of water, as they instantly soak into the ground at\r\nthe first touch. Nor is there any certain relief from allowing the\r\nwater to stand on the land and then drawing it off; in this case also\r\nthe salts soak down ahead of the water, and the water standing on the\r\nsurface remains almost unchanged. In very pervious soils and in the\r\ncase of white alkali, the washing-out can often be accomplished without\r\nspecial provision for underdrainage, by leaving the water on the land\r\nsufficiently long. But the laying of regular underdrains greatly\r\naccelerates the work, and renders success certain.\r\n\r\n_Leaching-Down._—In advance of underdrainage, it is quite generally\r\nfeasible, where the land has been leveled and diked for irrigation by\r\nsurface flooding, to leach the salts out of the first three or four\r\nfeet by continued flooding, thus taking them out of reach of the crop\r\nroots, or at all events giving the _seed_ an opportunity to escape\r\ninjury from alkali. This plan is especially effective in the case of\r\nalfalfa, the young seedlings of which are very sensitive, while the\r\ngrown plant is rather resistant. In order to obtain this relief so\r\nas to know what is being accomplished, the farmer should ascertain\r\nbeforehand how fast water will soak down in his ground;[174] for in\r\nheavy clay soils, and especially in those containing black alkali,\r\nthe soakage is sometimes so slow that the upward diffusion of the\r\nsalts keeps pace with the downward soakage; in which case nothing is\r\naccomplished by flooding, and underdrainage is the only remedy. But in\r\nmost soils of the arid region flooding from three days to a week will\r\nremove the alkali beyond reach of the roots of ordinary crops. If\r\nsubsequently irrigation is done by means of _deep_ furrows, the alkali\r\nsalts may be either kept at a low level continuously, or if the land\r\nbe at all pervious, the alkali may ultimately be permanently leached\r\nout into the subdrainage by farther flooding. When the alkali has not\r\naccumulated near the surface to any great extent, irrigation by deep\r\nfurrows may, alone, afford all the relief needed.\r\n\r\n[174] See p. 242, Chap. 13.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 71.—Lemon Orchard Affected by Alkali; Before Deep\r\nIrrigation.]\r\n\r\nIn the case illustrated by figures 71 and 72, irrigation by shallow\r\nfurrows with water too strongly charged with salts had so far added to\r\nthe natural alkali-content of the land that the lemon trees were being\r\ndefoliated. Upon the advice of the California Station the deep-furrow\r\nsystem was adopted, and within two years the results were as shown in\r\nfigure 72, the salts having been carried down and diluted so as to\r\nbecome harmless.\r\n\r\n_Underdrainage the Final and Universal Remedy for Alkali._—When we\r\nunderdrain an alkali soil, we adopt the very means by which the\r\nexistence of alkali lands in the humid regions is wholly prevented;\r\nthe leaching-out of the soluble salts formed in soil-weathering as\r\nfast as they are formed. The long and abundant experience had with\r\nunderdrainage in reclaiming saline sea-coast lands, applies directly\r\nand cogently to alkali lands. It is the universal remedy for all the\r\nevils of alkali, and its only drawback is the first expense, and the\r\nnecessity for obtaining an outlet for the drain waters, which cannot\r\nalways be had on the owner’s land. Hence it requires co-operation or\r\nlegislation to render the great improvement of underdrainage feasible.\r\nSuch legislation is well established in the old world, and has been\r\nenacted in several states even of the humid region. Where irrigation\r\nis practiced as a matter of necessity, underdrainage is a correlative\r\nnecessity, both to avoid the evils of over-irrigation and to relieve\r\nthe land of noxious alkali salts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 72.—The Above Orchard after Alkali was Driven Down\r\nby Deep Irrigation, followed by Cultivation.]\r\n\r\nThe drainage law now existing in California does not go farther than\r\nto authorize the formation of drainage districts, within which the\r\nnecessary taxes may be levied; and there is some difficulty in securing\r\npopular action. But bitter experience will doubtless in time compel\r\nunanimity, such as now exists, _e. g._, in Illinois, where drainage is\r\nnot nearly so urgently needed as it is in the irrigation states.\r\n\r\n_Possible Injury to Land by Excessive Leaching._—It should not be\r\nforgotten, however, that excessive leaching of underdrained land by\r\nflooding is liable to injure the soil in two ways: first, by the\r\nremoval of valuable soluble plant-food; and further, by rendering the\r\nland less retentive of moisture, such retention being favored by the\r\npresence of small amounts of alkali salts, not sufficient to injure\r\ncrops. After the salts have been carried down to a sufficient depth to\r\nprevent injury to annual crops, and with proper subsequent attention\r\nto the prevention of surface evaporation, the flooding will not need\r\nto be repeated for several years. Thus in many soils excellent crops\r\nmay be grown even in strong alkali land, pending the establishment of\r\npermanent drainage systems.\r\n\r\n    The importance of thoroughly washing the alkali deeply\r\n    into the soil before the seed is planted, and keeping it\r\n    there by proper means until the foliage of the plant shades\r\n    the soil sufficiently to prevent the rise of moisture and\r\n    alkali, is well illustrated in fields in the region of\r\n    Bakersfield, Cal., where alfalfa is now growing in soils\r\n    once heavily charged with alkali.[175] From one of these fields\r\n    samples of soil were taken where the alkali was supposed\r\n    to be strongest beneath the alfalfa, and also from an\r\n    adjoining untreated alkali spot, which was said to represent\r\n    conditions before alfalfa was planted. The results are given\r\n    in pounds per acre in four feet depth.\r\n\r\n    ===========================+========+==========+=========+========\r\n                               |Sulfate.|Carbonate.| Common  |  Total\r\n                               |        |          |  Salt.  | Alkali.\r\n    ---------------------------+--------+----------+---------+--------\r\n    Alkali spot before alfalfa |        |          |         |\r\n            was planted        | 60,120 |    720   | 175,840 | 236,680\r\n                               |        |          |         |\r\n    Alfalfa field; alkali      |        |          |         |\r\n                   washed down | 14,400 |          |   1,040 |  18,640\r\n    ---------------------------+--------+----------+---------+--------\r\n\r\n    Here the surface foot of the natural soil contained nearly\r\n    140,000 pounds of common salt, a prohibitory amount. Similar\r\n    experience has been had near Yuma, Arizona.\r\n\r\n[175] Bull. 133, Cal. Expt. Sta., by R. H. Loughridge.\r\n\r\n_Difficulty in Draining “Black” Alkali Lands._—An important exception\r\nto the efficacy of draining, however, occurs in the case of black\r\nalkali in most lands. In this case either the impervious hardpan or\r\n(in the case of actual alkali spots) the impenetrability of the surface\r\nsoil itself will render even underdrains ineffective unless the salsoda\r\nand its effects on the soil are first destroyed by the use of gypsum,\r\nas above detailed. This is not only necessary in order to render\r\ndrainage and leaching possible, but is also advisable in order to\r\nprevent the leaching-out of the valuable humus and soluble phosphates,\r\nwhich are rendered insoluble (but not unavailable to plants) by the\r\naction of the gypsum. Wherever black alkali is found in lands not very\r\nsandy, the application of gypsum should precede any other efforts\r\ntoward reclamation. Trees and vines already planted may be temporarily\r\nprotected from the worst effects of the black alkali by surrounding the\r\ntrunks with gypsum or with earth abundantly mixed with it. Seeds may be\r\nsimilarly protected in sowing, and young plants in planting.\r\n\r\n_Swamping of Alkali Lands._—It should, however, be remembered that the\r\n_swamping_ of alkali lands, whether of the white or black kind, is\r\nfatal not only to their present productiveness, but also, on account\r\nof the strong chemical action thus induced, greatly jeopardizes their\r\nfuture usefulness. Many costly investments in orchards and vineyards\r\nhave thus been rendered unproductive, or have even become a total loss.\r\n\r\n_Reduction of Alkali by Cropping._—Another method for diminishing the\r\namount of alkali in the soil is the cropping with plants that take\r\nup considerable amounts of salts. In taking them into cultivation,\r\nit is advisable to remove entirely from the land the salt growth\r\nthat may naturally cover it, notably the greasewoods (_Sarcobatus_,\r\n_Allenrolfea_), with their heavy percentage of alkaline ash (12 to 20\r\nper cent). Crop plants adapted to the same object are mentioned farther\r\non. Such crops should also, of course, be wholly removed from the land.\r\n\r\n_Total Amounts of Salts Compatible with Ordinary Crops; Tolerance of\r\nCulture Plants._—Since the amount of alkali that reaches the surface\r\nlayer is largely dependent upon the varying conditions of rainfall or\r\nirrigation, and surface evaporation, it is difficult to foresee to\r\nwhat extent that accumulation may go, unless we know the total amount\r\nof salts present that may be called into action. This, as already\r\nexplained, can ordinarily be ascertained by the examination of one\r\nsample representing the average of a soil column of four feet. By\r\ncalculating the figures so obtained to an acre of ground, we can at\r\nleast approximate the limits within or beyond which crops will succeed\r\nor perish. Applying this procedure to the cases represented in the\r\ndiagrams (pp. 434, 452, chapter 22) and estimating the weight of the\r\nsoil per acre-foot at 4,000,000 pounds, we find in the land on which\r\nbarley refused to grow the figures 32,470 and 43,660 pounds of total\r\nsalts per acre, respectively corresponding to 0.203 per cent for the\r\nfirst figure (the second, representing only the two surface feet, is\r\nnot strictly comparable). For the land on which barley gave a full\r\ncrop, we find for the May sample 25,550 pounds, equivalent to 0.159 per\r\ncent for the whole soil column of four feet. It thus appears that for\r\nbarley the limits of tolerance lie between the above two figures. It\r\nshould be noted that in this case a full crop of barley was grown even\r\nwhen the alkali consisted of fully one-half of the noxious carbonate\r\nof soda; proving that it is not necessary in every case to neutralize\r\nthe entire amount of that salt by means of gypsum, which in the present\r\ncase would have required about 9½ tons of gypsum per acre—a prohibitory\r\nexpenditure.\r\n\r\n_Relative Injuriousness of the Several Salts._—Of the three sodium\r\nsalts that usually constitute the bulk of “alkali,” only the carbonate\r\nof soda is susceptible of being materially changed by any agent that\r\ncan practically be applied to land. So far as we know, the salt of\r\nsodium least injurious to ordinary vegetation is the sulfate, commonly\r\ncalled Glauber’s salt, which ordinarily forms the chief ingredient of\r\n“white” alkali. Thus barley is capable of resisting about five times\r\nmore of the sulfate than of the carbonate, and quite twice as much as\r\nof common salt. Since the maximum percentage that can be resisted by\r\nplants varies materially with the kind of soil, it is difficult to give\r\nexact figures save with respect to particular cases. For the sandy loam\r\nof the Tulare substation, California, for instance, the maximum for\r\ncereals may be approximately stated to be one-tenth of 1 per cent for\r\nsalsoda; a fourth of 1 per cent for common salt; and from forty-five\r\nto fifty one-hundredths of one per cent of Glauber’s salt. For clay\r\nsoils the tolerance is in general markedly less, especially as regards\r\nthe salsoda; since in their case the injurious effect on the tilling\r\nqualities of the soil, already referred to, is superadded to the\r\ncorrosive action of that salt upon the plant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 73.—Alkali curve showing percentage of Alkali Salts\r\nin field of Sugar Beets, Oxnard, Calif.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 74.—Beets from corresponding positions in the above\r\nfield.]\r\n\r\n    _Effect of Differences in Composition of Alkali Salts on\r\n    Beets._—The marked differences which may occur as the\r\n    result of even slight variations in the proportions of the\r\n    several salts is well illustrated in the subjoined diagram\r\n    of observations made by Dr. G. W. Shaw, of the Cal. Expt.\r\n    station, upon beet fields in the neighborhood of Oxnard,\r\n    Cal. The lands lie not far from the seashore, and saline\r\n    water underruns them for considerable distance inland.\r\n    The soil and subsoil are quite sandy, so that it takes\r\n    irrigation water only about seven hours to penetrate from the\r\n    surface to bottom water at seven feet depth. The land on\r\n    which these observations were made are apparently level to\r\n    the eye, though probably the alkali belts on which the sugar\r\n    beets were “poor” are slightly depressed swales.\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that here the beets were “good” where the sulfate\r\n(Glauber’s salt) ranged up to .8%, with .10 to .20 of common salt; but\r\nthat so soon as the latter rose above .20, the beets were poor despite\r\nthe low percentage of Glauber’s salt; then became “good” again so\r\nsoon as the common salt fell below .20%, although the Glauber’s salt\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOLERANCE OF VARIOUS CROP PLANTS.\r\n\r\nThe following table, compiled by Dr. R. H. Loughridge mainly from his\r\nown observations,[176] gives the details of the tolerance for various\r\nculture plants as ascertained at the several experiment substations in\r\nCalifornia, as well as at other points in that State and in Arizona\r\nwhere critical cases could be found. It is thought preferable to\r\ninvestigate analytically such cases in the field, rather than to\r\nattempt to obtain results from small-scale experiments artificially\r\narranged, in which sources of error arising from evaporation and other\r\ncauses are most difficult to avoid.\r\n\r\n[176] Bulletins Nos. 128, 133 and 140, Calif. Expt. Station.\r\n\r\n    The table is so arranged as to show the maximum tolerance\r\n    thus far observed for each of the three single ingredients,\r\n    as well as the maximum of total salts found compatible with\r\n    good growth. In view of the extremely variable proportions\r\n    between the three chief ingredients found in nature, this\r\n    seems to be the only manner in which the observations made\r\n    can be intelligibly presented, until perhaps a great number\r\n    of such data shall enable us to evolve mathematical formulæ\r\n    expressing the tolerance for the possible mixtures for\r\n    each plant. For it is certain that the tolerance-figures\r\n    will be quite different in presence of other salts, from\r\n    those that would be obtained for each salt separately; or\r\n    for the calculated mean of such separate determinations,\r\n    proportionally pro-rated. It must also be remembered that in\r\n    all alkali soils, lime carbonate is abundantly present, as\r\n    is, nearly always, a greater or less amount of the sulfate\r\n    (gypsum). As already stated, according to the investigations\r\n    of Cameron not only these compounds, but also calcium\r\n    chlorid, exert a protective influence against the injury to\r\n    plant growth from compounds of sodium and potassium. The\r\n    figures here given can therefore be regarded only as\r\n    approximations, subject to correction by farther observation.\r\n    They are arranged from the highest tolerances downward, for\r\n    each of the three ingredients, as well as for the totals. The\r\n    latter are not, of course, the sums of the figures given in\r\n    the preceding columns, but independent data.\r\n\r\n          HIGHEST AMOUNT OF ALKALI IN WHICH FRUIT TREES\r\n                   WERE FOUND UNAFFECTED.[177]\r\n\r\n    Arranged from highest to lowest.

Expt. Station, June,\r\n1905.\r\n\r\n_Comments on the Above Table._—Considering in this table, first, the\r\nplants suitable for the stronger class of alkali lands, it may be\r\nsaid generally that the search for widely acceptable kinds has not\r\nbeen very successful. It is true that cattle will nibble green salt\r\ngrass (_Distichlis spicata_), but will soon leave it for any dry\r\nfeed that may be within reach. The enormous amount of salts which\r\nit will tolerate in the soil on which it grows, and the doubtless\r\ncorrespondingly large amount of those salts which it will absorb,\r\njudging from its taste, sufficiently explain the reluctance of cattle\r\nto feed on it to any considerable extent.\r\n\r\nThe same is true of all the fleshy plants that grow on the stronger\r\nalkali lands, and are known under the general designation of “alkali\r\nweeds.” When stock unaccustomed to it are forced by hunger to feed on\r\nsuch vegetation to any considerable extent, disordered digestion is\r\napt to result; which in such ranges, however, is often counteracted by\r\nfeeding on aromatic or astringent antidotes, such as the gray sagebrush\r\nand the more or less resinous herbage of plants of the sunflower family.\r\n\r\nIn the Great Basin region, lying between the Sierra Nevada and the\r\nfront range of the Rocky Mountains, there are, aside from the grasses,\r\nnumerous herbaceous and shrubby plants that afford valuable pasturage\r\nfor stock,[179] and some of these grow on moderately strong alkali\r\nland; the same is true in California. It is quite possible that some of\r\nthese will be found to lend themselves to ready propagation for culture\r\npurposes as well as they do for restocking the ranges. But thus far\r\nnone have found wider acceptance, probably because their stiff branches\r\nand upright habit render them inconvenient to handle. It will require\r\nmore extended experience and experiment before any of these will be\r\ndefinitely adopted for propagation by farmers and stockmen.\r\n\r\n[179] See Bulletin No. 16 of the Wyoming Experiment Station; also\r\nBulletin Nos, 2 and 12 of the Division of Agrostology, and Farmers’\r\nBulletin No. 108, U. S. Department of Agriculture.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Saltbushes, and Herbaceous Crops._\r\n\r\n_Australian Saltbushes._—Experience in California indicates that in the\r\nmore southerly portion of the arid region, unpalatable native plants\r\nmay be largely replaced, even on the ranges, by one or more species\r\nof the Australian saltbushes (_Atriplex spp._), long ago recommended\r\nby Baron von Mueller of Melbourne; of which one (_A. semibaccata_)\r\nhas proved eminently adapted to the climate and soil of California\r\nand is readily eaten by all kinds of stock. The facility with which\r\nit is propagated, its quick development, the large amount of feed\r\nyielded on a given area, even on the strongest alkali land ordinarily\r\nfound, and its thin, flexible stems, permitting it to be handled very\r\nmuch like alfalfa, seem to commend it especially to the farmers’\r\nconsideration wherever better forage plants cannot be grown and the\r\nclimate will permit of its use. It does not, however, resist the severe\r\ncold of the interior plateau country, and is wholly out of place in\r\nthe Pacific Coast region where summer fogs prevail. Most of the other\r\nAustralian species have an upright, shrubby habit, which adapts them\r\nbetter to browsing than to pasture proper. The same is true of the\r\nArgentine species (_A. Cachiyuyum_), which in its native pampas is\r\nhighly esteemed for that purpose, and succeeds well in California.\r\nOf other Australian saltbushes, _A. halimoides_, _vesicaria_ and\r\n_leptocarpa_ are the most promising; the latter is somewhat similar in\r\nhabit to the semibaccata, but is not as vigorous a grower. Since some\r\nof the saltbushes take up nearly one fifth of their dry weight of ash\r\ningredients,[180] largely common salt, the complete removal from the\r\nland of a five-ton crop of saltbush hay will take away nearly a ton of\r\nthe alkali salts per acre. This will in the course of some years be\r\nquite sufficient to reduce materially the saline contents of the land,\r\nand will frequently render possible the culture of ordinary crops.\r\n\r\n[180] Analyses made at the California station show 19.37 percent of ash\r\nin the air-dry matter of Australian saltbush. (See California Station\r\nBulletin No. 105; E. S. R., vol. 6, p. 718). Analyses of Russian\r\nthistle have been reported showing over 20 per cent of ash in dry\r\nmatter. (See Minnesota Sta. Bulletin No. 34; Iowa Sta. Bull. No. 26; E.\r\nS. R., vol. 6, pp. 552-553).\r\n\r\n_Modiola._—Alongside of the saltbushes, the Chilean plant _Modiola\r\nprocumbens_, now generally known as modiola simply, deserves attention,\r\nas it makes acceptable pasture where alfalfa fails to make a stand on\r\naccount of alkali. It is a trailing plant with medium-sized, roundish\r\nfoliage, and roots freely at the joints where they touch the ground.\r\nUnlike the saltbushes it is therefore a formidable weed where it is not\r\nwanted; but as according to California experience it resists as much as\r\n52,000 pounds of salts per acre, even when 41,000 of these is common\r\nsalt, it is likely to be useful in many cases, particularly as an\r\nadmixture to a saltbush diet for stock, as it does not absorb as much\r\nsalt as the latter. It seems best adapted to pasturage.\r\n\r\nAs the table shows that, once grown to the age of a few years, alfalfa\r\nwill resist a percentage of alkali next to the saltbush, it will\r\ngenerally be worth while, in lands otherwise adapted to alfalfa, to\r\nprepare the land by leaching-down (see above) so as to secure a stand\r\nof the more valuable crop.\r\n\r\n_Native Grasses._[181]—Of all known plants that stock will eat somewhat\r\nfreely, the tussock grass (_Sporobolus airoides_, of which a figure\r\nis given farther on), a native of the southern arid region, endures\r\nthe largest amounts of alkali; having been found growing well on land\r\ncontaining the enormous amount of nearly half a million pounds of salts\r\nper acre, although it will thrive with only 49,000 pounds in the soil.\r\nWhat it will do under cultivation has never been fairly tested; but\r\nits bare tussocks, killed by the excessive browsing of stock, testify\r\nto its acceptableness as forage. It does not seem to absorb excessive\r\namounts of salts.\r\n\r\n[181] It should be understood that the plants so referred to are\r\nexclusively the _true_ grasses, recognized as such by every child,\r\nand not forage plants generally; which are sometimes so designated;\r\nnot only by farmers, but by some authors who fail to appreciate the\r\npractical importance of the distinction, which makes it necessary that\r\nfarmers should be taught to understand it.\r\n\r\nAside from the alkali grass proper (_Distichlis_), mentioned above,\r\nthe so-called rye grass of the Northwest (_Elymus condensatus_) is\r\nprobably, next to the tussock grass, the most resistant species among\r\nthe wild grasses. Its southern form, with several others not positively\r\nidentified, occupies largely the milder alkali lands of southern\r\nCalifornia. This grass, though rather coarse, is regularly cut for hay\r\nin the low grounds of Oregon and Washington.\r\n\r\nDoubtless some of the indigenous grasses of the interior plateau\r\nregion and of the great plains east of the Rocky Mountains, such as\r\nthe buffalo and grama grasses, as well as several of the wheat grasses\r\n(_Agropyron_) and bunch grasses (_Festuca_, _Poa_, _Stipa_, etc.) will\r\nprove resistant to larger proportions of alkali than the meadow and\r\npasture grasses of the regions of summer rains.\r\n\r\n_Cultivated Grasses._—The superficial rooting and fine fibrous roots\r\nof the true annual grasses render them, as a whole, rather sensitive\r\nto alkali; yet the cereals—barley, wheat, rye and oats—resist, as the\r\ntable shows, the average alkali salts to the extent of from 17,000\r\ntotal salts, with not exceeding 1500 pounds of carbonate, in the case\r\nof the more delicate varieties of wheat, to over 25,000 pounds per acre\r\nin the case of barley, which with the gluten wheats and rye seems to\r\nhave the highest tolerance-figure. The special adaptation of gluten\r\nwheats to arid conditions is thus emphasized. The roots of these\r\ncereals are comparatively stout, with thick epidermis.\r\n\r\nAmong the cultivated forage grasses proper, the Australian variety of\r\nthe English ray (generally miscalled rye) grass seems most resistant.\r\nThe eastern fescues, Kentucky blue grass, and others at home in the\r\nhumid region are easily injured, as those who try to maintain lawns\r\non alkali-tainted lands, or by irrigation with alkali waters, know\r\nto their sorrow. To these grasses common salt and bittern (magnesium\r\nchlorid) seem to be particularly injurious, and they tolerate but\r\nlittle “black alkali.”\r\n\r\nOn the rather close-textured soil at Chino, California, the loliums,\r\nincluding the darnel (“California cheat”), and the Australian and\r\nItalian ray (“rye”) grasses, succeed fairly on land containing as much\r\nas 6,000 pounds of (white) salts. Most other cultivated grasses failed\r\nconspicuously alongside of these. It must be remembered that in more\r\nloose-textured, sandy lands than those in which these tests were made,\r\nthe above figures for tolerance would probably be increased by 30\r\npercent or more.\r\n\r\n_Maize_ is rather sensitive to alkali, and suffers even on slightly\r\nalkaline land, owing doubtless to the large development of fine\r\nwhite rootlets near the surface, so familiar to corn-growers. The\r\n_Sorghums_, and especially Egyptian corn (durra) are much less\r\nsensitive, as the table shows, and are among the first crops to be\r\ntried on alkali lands. The related millets share this resistance more\r\nor less, and we often see on cultivated lands in the alkali region fine\r\nstands of barnyard grass (_Panicum crusgalli_) of which the variety (?)\r\n_P. muticum_ is said by observers of the U. S. Dept. of Agriculture\r\nto be specially resistant, and acceptable to stock. One of the most\r\nsuccessful grasses on the light alkali lands near Chino, where most\r\nof the commonly cultivated grasses fail, was a near relative of the\r\nbarnyard grass, the _Eleusine coracana_, which produces heavy crops\r\nof a millet-like grain much relished by poultry, and also by stock.\r\nThis grass, largely grown in Egypt, has succeeded well all over the\r\nground whose alkali content ranges up to 12,000 pounds per acre, but\r\nfailed where the salts reached 38,840 pounds in the surface foot.\r\nNext to this, in point of success, were the pearl millet (_Pennisetum\r\ntyphoideum_) and teosinte, Hungarian brome grass, and Japanese millet,\r\non land containing about 9,000 pounds of (chiefly “white”) salts per\r\nacre.\r\n\r\n_Other Herbaceous Crops. Legumes._—Both the natural growth of alkali\r\nlands and experimental tests seem to show that this entire family\r\n(peas, beans, clovers, etc.) are among the more sensitive and least\r\navailable wherever black alkali exists; while fairly tolerant of the\r\nwhite (neutral) salts. Apparently a very little salsoda suffices to\r\ndestroy the tubercle-forming organisms that are so important a medium\r\nof nitrogen-nutrition in these plants. Excepting the melilots, alfalfa\r\nwith its hard, stout and long taproot, seems to resist best of all\r\nthese plants.\r\n\r\n    As a general thing, taprooted plants, when once established,\r\n    resist best, for the obvious reason that the main mass of\r\n    their feeding roots reaches below the danger level. Another\r\n    favoring condition, already alluded to, is heavy foliage and\r\n    consequent shading of the ground; alfalfa happens to combine\r\n    both of these advantages. There has been some difficulty\r\n    in obtaining a full stand of alfalfa in the portion of the\r\n    Chino substation tract containing from 4000 to 6000 pounds\r\n    of (largely black) alkali salts per acre; but once obtained,\r\n    it has done very well.\r\n\r\nThe only other plant of this family that succeeds well on this land,\r\nand even (at Tulare) on soil considerably stronger (probably between\r\n20,000 and 30,000 pounds) are the two melilots, _M. indica_, and\r\n_alba_; the latter (the Bokhara clover) is a forage plant of no mean\r\nvalue in moist climates, but somewhat restricted in its use in the\r\narid region because of the very high aroma it develops, especially\r\nin alkali lands; so that stock will eat only limited amounts, best\r\nwhen intermixed with other forage, such as the saltbushes. The yellow\r\nmelilot is highly recommended by the Arizona Experiment Station as\r\na green-manure plant for winter growth; but farther north it is a\r\nsummer-growing plant only, and is refused by stock. As already stated,\r\nvery few plants belonging to this family are naturally found on alkali\r\nlands, and attempts to grow them, even where only Glauber’s salt is\r\npresent, have been but very moderately successful.\r\n\r\nFor most of the legumes the limit of full success seems to lie between\r\n3000 and 4000 pounds to the acre. A marked exception, however, occurs\r\nin the case of the hairy vetch, as shown in the table, where it is\r\ncredited, on the basis of repeated experiments, with a tolerance of\r\nnearly 70,000 pounds. This amount was attained, however, in rather\r\nsandy soils. Probably some of the Algerian vetches will likewise prove\r\nmore resistant than those which are natives of humid climates.\r\n\r\n_Mustard Family._—As in the case of the legumes, wild plants of the\r\n_mustard_ family are rare on alkali lands; and correspondingly, the\r\ncultivated mustard, kale, rape, etc., fail even on land quite weak\r\nin alkali. Their limit of tolerance seems to lie near 4,000 to 5,000\r\npounds per acre even of white salts. Hence turnips and radishes do not\r\nflourish on alkali lands.\r\n\r\n_Sunflower Family._—Several of the hardiest of the native “alkali\r\nweeds” belong to the _sunflower_ family, and the common wild sunflowers\r\n(_Helianthus californicus_ and _H. annuus_) are common on lands\r\npretty strongly alkaline. The cultivated Russian sunflower, as the\r\ntable shows, resists the effects of nearly 60,000 pounds of total\r\nalkali, of which 52,640 pounds was sulfate (Glauber’s salt), and 5440\r\ncommon salt. This, it will be seen, is a very high tolerance, so\r\nthat this sunflower, yielding such excellent poultry feed, is very\r\nwidely available. Correspondingly, the “Jerusalem artichoke,” itself\r\na sunflower, is among the available crops on moderately strong alkali\r\nsoils; and so, doubtless, are other members of the same relationship\r\nnot yet tested, such as the true artichoke, salsify, etc. Chicory,\r\nbelonging to the same family, yielded roots at the rate of twelve tons\r\nper acre, on land of the Chino tract containing about 8,000 pounds of\r\nsalts per acre.\r\n\r\n_Root Crops._—It seems to be generally true that root crops suffer in\r\nquality, however satisfactory may be the quantity, harvested on lands\r\nrich in salts, and especially in chlorids (common salt). It was noted\r\nat the Tulare substation (California) that the tubers of the artichoke\r\nwere inclined to be “squashy” in the stronger alkali land, and failed\r\nto keep well; the same was true of potatoes, which were very watery;\r\nand also of turnips and carrots. It is a fact well known in Europe,\r\nthat potatoes manured with kainit (chlorids of potassium and sodium)\r\nare unfit for the manufacture of starch, and are generally of inferior\r\nquality. But this is found not to be the case when, instead of the\r\nchlorids, the sulfate is used; hence the advice, often repeated by the\r\nCalifornia station, that farmers desiring to use potash fertilizers\r\nshould call for the “high-grade sulfate” instead of the cheaper\r\nkainit, which adds to the injurious salts already so commonly present\r\nin lowland soils of the arid region. Such root crops are, however,\r\navailable for stock feed.\r\n\r\nThe common _beet_ (including the mangel-wurzel) is known to succeed\r\nwell on saline seashore lands, and it maintains its reputation on\r\nalkali lands also. Being especially tolerant of common salt, it may\r\nbe grown where other crops fail on this account; but the roots so\r\ngrown are strongly charged with common salt, and have, as is well\r\nknown, been used for the purpose of removing excess of the same from\r\nsea-coast-marsh lands. Such roots are wholly unfit for sugar-making.\r\n\r\nIt is quite otherwise with Glauber’s salt (sodium sulfate); and as\r\nthis is very commonly predominant in alkali lands, either before or\r\nafter the gypsum treatment, this fact is of great importance, for it\r\nfrequently permits of the successful growing of the sugar beet; as\r\nhas been abundantly proved at the Chino ranch, where land containing\r\nas much as 60,000 pounds of salts, mostly this compound, has yielded\r\nroots of very high grade, both as to sugar percentage and purity. But\r\nthe analyses of the Oxnard soil show that more than 10,000 pounds of\r\ncommon salt will be required to render sugar beets unsatisfactory for\r\nsugar-making.\r\n\r\nPassing to _stem crops_, we find that _asparagus_, originally itself a\r\ndenizen of the sea-board, resists considerable amounts (not yet exactly\r\ndetermined) of common salt as well as of Glauber’s salt. It is even\r\nclaimed that when grown with a dressing of common salt the asparagus is\r\nmore tender and savory. But it is quite sensitive to “black alkali,”\r\nwhich must be neutralized with gypsum to render it harmless.\r\n\r\n_Celery_ did well with 13,640 pounds, of which nearly 10,000 was common\r\nsalt. But with 30,000 pounds the plants were killed.\r\n\r\n_Rhubarb_ was a conspicuous failure, even in the weak and mostly\r\n“white” alkali lands of the Chino station tract.\r\n\r\n_Textile Plants._—_Japanese hemp_, while young, seemed to have a\r\nhard struggle with the alkali, but at the end of the season stood\r\neight feet high. The _ramie_ plant, also, will bear moderately strong\r\nalkali, apparently somewhat over 12,000 pounds per acre. _Flax_ has\r\nnot been tested in cultivation; but the wide distribution of wild flax\r\nall over the arid portions of the States of Oregon and Washington,\r\nwould seem to indicate that it is not very sensitive. Another textile\r\nplant, the Indian mallow (_Abutilon avicennae_), was found to fail\r\non the Chino alkali soil. But its close relative, cotton, does not\r\nseem to be specially sensitive, according to the experience had with\r\nit in the Merced river bottom in California; and its culture is\r\nextensive in Egypt, where no particular care seems to be exercised in\r\nselecting the land for the crop. It is just possible that the saline\r\ncontent of the soil has in California, as well as in the Atlantic\r\nsea-islands, contributed to the superior length of the fiber shown in\r\nthe measurements made during the Census work of 1880.[182]\r\n\r\n[182] Report on Cotton Culture; 10th Census of the United States, vol.\r\n5, pp. 23 to 34.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tolerance of Shrubs and Trees._\r\n\r\n_Grapevines._—The European grape, _Vitis vinifera_, is quite tolerant\r\nof white or neutral alkali salts, and will resist even a moderate\r\namount of the black so long as no hardpan is allowed to form. At\r\nthe Tulare substation it was found that grapevines did well in sandy\r\nland containing 35,230 pounds of alkali salts, of which one half was\r\nGlauber’s salt, 9,640 pounds carbonate of soda, 7,550 pounds of common\r\nsalt, and 750 pounds nitrate of soda. They were badly distressed\r\nwhere, of a total of 37,020 pounds of alkali salts, 25,620 pounds\r\nwas carbonate of soda; while where the vines had died out, there was\r\nfound a total of 73,930 pounds, with 37,280 pounds of carbonate. The\r\nEuropean vine, then, is considerably more resistant of alkali even in\r\nits worst (black) form, than barley and rye, at least on sandy land;\r\nand it seems likely that the native grapevines of the Pacific coast,\r\n_californica_, and _arizonica_, would resist even better; a point still\r\nunder experiment.\r\n\r\nExperience, however, has shown that vines rapidly succumb when by\r\nexcessive irrigation the bottom water is allowed to rise, increasing\r\nthe amount of alkali salts near the surface, and shallowing the soil\r\nat their disposal. Such over-irrigation has been a fruitful cause\r\nof injury to vineyards in the Fresno region, and would doubtless if\r\npracticed kill most of the vines at the Tulare substation, which are\r\nnow flourishing. In such cases, sometimes the formation of hardpan is\r\nfollowed by that of a concentrated alkaline solution above it, strong\r\nenough to corrode the roots themselves, and not only killing the vines,\r\nbut rendering the land unfit for any agricultural use whatsoever. The\r\nswamping of alkali lands, whether of the white or black kind, is not\r\nonly fatal to their present productiveness, but, on account of the\r\nstrong chemical action thus induced, greatly jeopardizes their future\r\nusefulness. Many costly investments in orchards and vineyards have thus\r\nbeen rendered unproductive, or have even become a total loss.\r\n\r\nIt should be remembered in this connection that as the roots of vines\r\nwill, when unobstructed, go to depths of fifteen and even twenty feet,\r\na subsequent rise of the bottom water from leaky irrigation ditches\r\nwill drown out the ends of the deep roots and thus cause the whole root\r\nsystem to become diseased, inevitably resulting in unproductiveness, if\r\nnot death, of the vine.\r\n\r\n_Citrus Trees._—Although the high figure of nearly 27,000 pounds for\r\nthe tolerance of citrus trees, as given in the table, seems to place\r\nthem rather high on the list, such high tolerance actually occurs\r\nonly in very sandy soils, and when common salt is in small proportion.\r\nGenerally speaking, the citrus tribe are rather sensitive to alkali\r\nsalts, and more especially to common salt. In fact, as to the high\r\ntolerance-figure given in the table, observed in sandy land, the\r\nalkali there contained only a trace of common salt. Young seedling\r\ntrees are particularly sensitive; so that it is often difficult to\r\nobtain a stand even when, later on, the feeding roots descend beyond\r\nthe reach of injury. In the close-textured lands of Chino, young trees\r\nhardly maintained life with more than 5,000 pounds of total salts.\r\nNear Riverside, full-grown trees perished under the influence of\r\nbottom water containing 0.25%, or 146 grains of salt per gallon, which\r\nimpregnated the ground; corresponding to about 9,000 pounds per acre in\r\nfour feet.\r\n\r\nIn the sandy loam lands near Corona, trees eight years old suffered\r\nseverely when by irrigation with alkali-water the alkali-content of\r\nthe land reached 11,000 pounds per acre; as illustrated in Figs. Nos.\r\n44, and 45. At another point in the same region, two representative\r\ntrees were selected for comparison, five rows apart on land absolutely\r\nidentical; one of these retained its leaves, though suffering, the\r\nother was completely leafless. The leaching of the alkali to the depth\r\nof four feet gave the following results, calculated to pounds per acre:\r\n\r\n                 Sulfates.  Carbonates.  Chlorids.  Total.\r\n\r\n    Poor tree     4,720       1,680        2,520    8,920\r\n    Better tree   4,120       2,360          720    7,200\r\n\r\nHere it is apparently the excess of common salt to which the difference\r\nis due, and this despite the higher content of carbonate of soda in the\r\nsoil bearing the better tree.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, at the Tulare substation orange trees (sour stock)\r\nmaintain vigorous growth and good bearing in a very sandy tract which\r\nto the depth of seven feet showed an aggregate content of 26,840 pounds\r\nof salts (or 22,780 to four feet depth); but which is never irrigated.\r\n(See diagram No. 66). The salts in this case consists wholly of sulfate\r\nand carbonate of soda in the ratio of fifty-four to forty-two, implying\r\nthe presence of nearly 12,000 pounds of salsoda within reach of the\r\ntree roots; yet in the absence of common salt, no perceptible injury or\r\neven stress upon the trees has been noted.\r\n\r\nAccording to observations made in San Diego county, Calif., lemon trees\r\nare even more sensitive to common salt than oranges, since a total\r\ncontent of 8,000 pounds per acre, about one-third of which was common\r\nsalt, seemed to render the trees wholly unprofitable.\r\n\r\nIn view of these facts, showing that common salt is the portion of\r\nalkali by far most injurious to citrus trees, great care should be\r\ntaken in the use of irrigation waters to exclude those charged with\r\nthat compound; and also to avoid locating citrus orchards on land\r\nalready impregnated with common salt.\r\n\r\nThe _olive_ tree, as the table shows, is among the most resistant to\r\nalkali salts, approaching the grape in this respect. This might have\r\nbeen anticipated from its extended culture in the arid regions of the\r\nold world, including Palestine and northern Africa, where alkali lands\r\nabound. It is probable that the figure given in the table does not yet\r\nshow the extreme limit of its endurance.\r\n\r\nCalifornia experience with the _date palm_, as the table shows, credits\r\nit with an endurance not exceeding 8320 pounds of total salts. This is\r\ndoubtless an underestimate, for in the Sahara desert and Egypt it is\r\ncredited with being the culture which will succeed in stronger alkali\r\nthan any other cultural plant; and, according to Mr. Means of the\r\nUnited States Department of Agriculture, it is sometimes irrigated with\r\nwater containing as much as 200 grains of salts per gallon. It should\r\nbe remembered, however, that these trees always grow in very sandy\r\nlands; and in the desert regions it is often grown below the surface\r\nof the ground, so as to render it wholly independent of the alkali\r\naccumulations on the surface. The extreme limit of its endurance must\r\ntherefore remain in doubt until more extended experiments have made\r\nmore definite data available.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Deciduous Orchard Trees._\r\n\r\nAmong deciduous orchard trees, strangely enough, the _almond_ stands\r\nalongside of the fig in alkali-resistance, as indicated in the table.\r\nThe _peach_ seems to be much more sensitive, ranking near the _apricot_\r\nand _prune_, whose tolerance is less than half as high. That the\r\n_pear_ and _apple_, generally counted among the more northern fruits\r\nin the humid region, should excel these stone fruits in endurance of\r\nalkali, is rather unexpected; and the figures concerning the whole\r\ngroup of these rosaceous fruits admonish us that it is unsafe to\r\npredict, without trial, what may be the outcome of culture tests. Thus\r\nplum trees, apparently in good condition, sometimes suddenly begin to\r\nfail when starting to bear; the fruit appears normal on the outside\r\nfor a time, but the pit fails to form, being at times flattened out\r\nlike a piece of pasteboard; and the fruit does not mature. Yet there\r\nis no observable injury to the base of the trunk, or to the roots. On\r\nthe other hand, pears do well even when the outside bark around the\r\nroot-crown is blackened by the action of the alkali salts. But 38,000\r\npounds, even of sulfate, proves too much for the pear.\r\n\r\nThe _quince_ appears to be materially more resistant than the apple or\r\npear. It probably ranges alongside of the fig, the soil-adaptations of\r\nwhich it shares in other respects also.\r\n\r\nThe _English walnut_ resents even a slight taint of _black_ alkali;\r\nbut is fairly tolerant of “white” salts, as is shown in the peculiarly\r\nsuitable light loam soils on the lower Santa Clara river, in Ventura\r\ncounty, as well as in Orange county, California.\r\n\r\nClose figures for the limits of alkali tolerance in the case of\r\ndeciduous orchard trees cannot easily be given or determined, owing to\r\nthe difficulties inherent in the differences of root penetration in the\r\nseveral soils and localities; as well as the fact already alluded to,\r\nthat in close-textured soils the tolerance is in general decidedly less\r\nthan in sandy lands. Hence the figures in the table must be taken as\r\nmore nearly representing _relative_ tolerances, rather than absolute\r\ndata to be applied in every case. As regards the stone fruits, it\r\nshould be remembered that the Myrobalan root, being at home in Asia\r\nMinor, where alkali abounds, should when practicable be used wherever\r\nalkali conditions exist, in preference to all but the almond, which\r\nseems to resist well, even on its own root, but has not as wide a range\r\nof adaptations as a grafting stock as the myrobalan. While most of the\r\nother stone fruits at the Tulare substation were on myrabalan roots,\r\nthe stock of those in outside orchards was mostly in doubt. It is also\r\nto be kept in mind that different varieties of the same fruit—_e.\r\ng._, pears and apples—show a not inconsiderable variation in their\r\nresistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Timber and Shade Trees._\r\n\r\nOf trees, forest and shade, suitable for alkali lands, some native ones\r\ncall for mention. One is the California white or valley oak (_Quercus\r\nlobata_), which forms a dense forest of large trees on the (almost\r\nthroughout somewhat alkaline) delta lands of the Kaweah River in\r\nCalifornia, and is found scatteringly all over the San Joaquin Valley.\r\nUnfortunately this tree does not supply timber valuable for aught but\r\nfirewood or fence posts, being quite brittle.\r\n\r\nThe native _cottonwoods_, while somewhat retarded and dwarfed in\r\ntheir growth in strong alkali, are quite tolerant of the white salts,\r\nespecially of Glauber’s salt. As they usually grow near to the water,\r\ntheir tolerance for alkali salts is difficult to ascertain.\r\n\r\nOf other trees, the _oriental plane_, or sycamore, and the _black\r\nlocust_ have proved the most resistant in the alkali lands of the San\r\nJoaquin Valley; and the former being a very desirable shade tree, it\r\nshould be widely used throughout the regions where alkali prevails more\r\nor less. The _ailantus_ is about equally resistant, and but for the\r\nevil odor of its flowers, deserves strong commendation.\r\n\r\nOf the _eucalypts_, the narrow-leaved _Eucalyptus amygdalina_ (one of\r\nthe “red gums”) and the closely related _viminalis_, seem to be least\r\nsensitive, and in some cases have grown in alkali lands as rapidly\r\nas anywhere. The _rostrata_, as well as the pink flowered variety of\r\n_sideroxylon_, are now doing about as well as the _amygdalina_ at\r\nTulare, where at first they seemed to suffer. The common blue gum,\r\n_globulus_, is much more sensitive.\r\n\r\nOf the _Acacias_, the tall-growing _A. melanoxylon_ (“black acacia”)\r\nresists pretty strong alkali, even on stiff soil; as can be seen at\r\nTulare and Bakersfield, California, where there are trees nearly two\r\nfeet in diameter. The beautiful _A. lophantha_ (_Albizzia_) has in\r\nplantings made along the San Joaquin Valley railroad shown considerable\r\nresistance, likewise; but it is quite sensitive to frost.\r\n\r\nOf other Australian trees, one of the Australian “pines,” (_Casuarina\r\nequisetifolia_), is doing well on fairly strong alkali land in the San\r\nJoaquin Valley.\r\n\r\nA remarkably alkali-resistant shrub or small tree is the pretty\r\n_Kœlreuteria paniculata_ from China, which at Tulare is growing in\r\nsome of the strongest alkali soil of the tract. Unfortunately it is\r\navailable mainly for ornamental purposes; its wood, while small, is\r\nvery hard and makes excellent fuel.\r\n\r\nOf trees indigenous to the Atlantic and East Central United States,\r\nthe Tulip tree, the Linden, and most other trees of the humid region,\r\nincluding the English oak (_Quercus pedunculata_) become stunted\r\nin alkali soils. The _honey locust_, being particularly adapted to\r\ncalcareous lands, does moderately well on alkali lands, but its thorns\r\nand imperfect shade render it not very desirable. The _black locust_\r\nand the _elms_ have on the whole done best. The eastern maples are not\r\nsuccessful; but the California maple (_Acer macrophyllum_) and the box\r\nelder (_Negundo californica_) have done fairly well in the lighter\r\nalkali lands of the San Joaquin Valley.\r\n\r\nThe _Conifers_—Pines, firs, cedars, cypress, etc., are very sensitive\r\nto black alkali and will not endure much even of the “white” salts.\r\nEven the native juniper of the mesas carefully adheres to the\r\nportions—breaks and upper slopes, hilltops, etc.—which are more or less\r\nleached by the scanty rains of these regions.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDUCEMENTS TOWARD THE RECLAMATION OF ALKALI LANDS.\r\n\r\nThe expense involved in the reclamation of strong alkali lands\r\nnaturally gives rise to the question whether adequate advantages are\r\nlikely to be derived from such expenditure; specially when the last\r\nresort—underdraining and leaching—has to be adopted.\r\n\r\nThose familiar with the alkali regions are aware how often the\r\noccurrence of alkali spots interrupts the continuity of fields and\r\norchards, of which they form only a small part, but enough to mar their\r\naspect and cultivation. Their increase and expansion under irrigation\r\nfrequently renders their reclamation the only alternative of absolute\r\nabandonment of the investments and improvements made, and from that\r\npoint of view alone it is of no slight practical importance. Moreover,\r\nthe occurrence of vast continuous stretches of alkali lands within the\r\notherwise most eligibly situated valley lands of the irrigation region\r\nforms a strong incentive towards their utilization.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 1st year, 2d year, 3d year, Fourth year—42 bushels.\r\n\r\nFIG. 75.—Wheat grown on black alkali land at Tulare Substation,\r\nCalifornia, showing improvement in successive years of reclamation\r\ntreatment.]\r\n\r\nThere is, however, a strong intrinsic reason pointing in the\r\nsame direction, namely, the almost invariably high and lasting\r\nproductiveness of these lands when once rendered available to\r\nagriculture. This is foreshadowed by the usually heavy and luxuriant\r\ngrowth of native plants around the margins and between alkali spots\r\n(see fig. 60); _i. e._, wherever the amount of injurious salts\r\npresent is so small as not to interfere with the utilization of the\r\nabundant store of plant-food which, under the peculiar conditions of\r\nsoil-formation in arid climates, remains in the land instead of being\r\nwashed into the ocean. Extended comparative investigations of soil\r\ncomposition, as well as the experience of thousands of years in the\r\noldest settled countries of the world, demonstrate this fact and show\r\nthat so far from being in need of fertilization, alkali lands usually\r\npossess extraordinary productive capacity whenever freed from the\r\ninjurious influence of the excess of useless salts left in the soil in\r\nconsequence of deficient rainfall. (See analyses, chapter 22, pp. 436,\r\n437).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 76.—Grains grown on alkali land at Tulare Station,\r\nCalifornia.]\r\n\r\nAmong many striking examples of the results of such reclamation, is\r\nthat represented in the annexed figure (75), of grain grown on strong\r\nalkali land, before and after reclamation treatment. On the original\r\nland even “alkali weeds” would hardly grow; while afterward a wheat\r\ncrop representing forty-two bushels per acre was grown. Additional\r\nillustrations are shown in the second figure (76), showing crops of\r\nwheat and barley as grown on partly reclaimed land at the Tulare\r\nsubstation.\r\n\r\nWhile it is certainly true that when rightly treated, alkali lands can\r\nbe rendered profusely and lastingly productive, yet close attention and\r\nconstant vigilance are needed so long as the salts remain in the soil;\r\nand no one not determined to give such land such full attention, should\r\nundertake to cultivate it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART FOURTH.\r\n\r\nSOILS AND NATIVE VEGETATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.[183]\r\n\r\nTHE RECOGNITION OF CHARACTER OF SOILS FROM THEIR NATIVE VEGETATION;\r\nMISSISSIPPI.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Climatic and Soil-Conditions._—Next to climatic conditions, chief\r\namong which are temperature and moisture, the physical and chemical\r\nnature of the soil and subsoil is the most potent factor in determining\r\nthe natural vegetation of any region. The limitations we observe in the\r\nadaptation of cultivated lands to certain crops, even with artificial\r\nhelp, must be much more strongly pronounced when no such aid is given,\r\nand the struggle for the survival of the fittest is continued, subject\r\nonly to seasonal variations, for thousands of years. It is obvious\r\nthat within the limits of the regional flora, _the natural vegetation\r\nof any tract represents the best adaptation of plants to soils, in the\r\nresults of long periods of the struggle for existence between competing\r\nspecies_; the survivors being those best adapted to the entire\r\nenvironment.\r\n\r\n[183] The special object of this chapter as a whole has seemed to the\r\nwriter to require a repetition of much that is already said in the\r\npreceding chapters.\r\n\r\nIn countries uninhabited by man the chief conditions outside of the\r\ndirect influence of climate and soil that may materially affect the\r\nresults of the competition are connected with the animal creation;\r\nand within the latter, insects are probably the most influential,\r\nbeneficially in the part they play in the fertilization of flowers,\r\ninjuriously in their role as parasites. Since in the absence of man,\r\nthe effects of fire would ordinarily be conditioned upon the occurrence\r\nof thunderstorms, its effects would then properly come under the head\r\nof climatic influences. But while these and some other disturbing\r\nfactors must not be forgotten in considering the relations of soils to\r\nthe natural vegetation borne by them, the common consensus of mankind\r\nhas long recognized the intimate connection existing between the two,\r\nand has everywhere made it the basis of at least a general estimate of\r\nthe agricultural value of the land concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURAL VEGETATION THE BASIS OF AGRICULTURAL LAND VALUES IN THE UNITED\r\nSTATES.[184]\r\n\r\nIn countries long settled, as in Europe, where the nature of the\r\noriginal forest is unknown or a matter of tradition only, the\r\nadaptations of the several kinds of land to culture plants and forest\r\ntrees has been gradually ascertained by cultural experience, and\r\ntheir designations, values and uses determined accordingly. In the\r\nUnited States, the character of the original forest growth is mostly\r\nin evidence, or is definitely known by tradition, even in the older\r\nstates. West of the Alleghenies, there is as yet little difficulty in\r\nthis regard, partly because even where the original forest growth has\r\ndisappeared its character remains on record, the assessed land values\r\nbeing very commonly based upon the tree growth of the wild land. In\r\nthe Southern States especially, the classification of uplands into\r\n“pine lands” and “oak lands” is universal, and is associated with\r\ncertain limits of valuation, both by assessors and purchasers. Within\r\neach of these two classes, however, there are well-defined gradations\r\nof cultural value according to the kind (species) _e. g._, of pine or\r\noak that occupies the ground, either alone, or in intermixture with\r\nother trees whose presence or absence is considered significant. In\r\nthe case of “bottoms” or alluvial lands, corresponding distinctions\r\nand classifications obtain; we hear of hickory, beech, gum, and cherry\r\nbottoms, hackberry hammocks, etc. each name being associated with\r\ncertain cultural values or peculiarities of soil, well understood by\r\nthe farming population.\r\n\r\n[184] See above, pp. 313 to 315, chapter 18.\r\n\r\n\r\nINVESTIGATION OF CAUSES GOVERNING THE DISTRIBUTION OF NATIVE VEGETATION.\r\n\r\nIt seems singular that such well and widely understood designations\r\nand important distinctions should not long ago have been made the\r\nsubject of careful investigation and precise definition by agricultural\r\ninvestigators. For apart from their practical importance as guides to\r\nthe purchaser of land, or settler, this correlation of land-values and\r\nnatural vegetation is of the utmost interest in offering an opportunity\r\nfor researches on the factors which determine the choice of these\r\nseveral trees and the corresponding shrubby and herbaceous growths.\r\nMoreover, the cultural results and adaptations corresponding to certain\r\nnatural growths being known from experience, a thorough knowledge\r\nof the soils so characterized should enable us to project into new\r\nlands, where experience is lacking, the benefits of experience already\r\nhad; even in cases where, from some cause, the natural vegetation is\r\ndifferent, or absent. Only very fragmentary and casual observations\r\nin this line are on record thus far, almost the only generally\r\nrecognized chemical characterization of plant habit being that of\r\ncalciphile (lime-loving), and calcifuge (lime-repelled) ones, but with\r\nfew attempts at more than local application. Yet, to ascertain by\r\nthe physical and chemical examination of soils what are determining\r\nfactors of certain natural vegetative preferences, which are invariably\r\nfollowed by certain agricultural results, should not be an unsolvable\r\nproblem, and its practical importance should justify its most active\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\n_Investigations in Mississippi._—In his explorations connected with\r\nthe Geological and Agricultural Survey of the State of Mississippi, as\r\nwell as, later on, in similar researches carried on in other states,\r\nthe writer was forcibly struck with the close correspondence of the\r\nlimits of geological formations with those of vegetative zones; so much\r\nso that he was led to rely very largely on the latter as indicative of\r\nthe probable occurrence of outcrops that otherwise, in a level country,\r\nwould have passed unperceived.\r\n\r\nThese observations upon the correlations between virgin soils and their\r\nnative vegetation having originally been made by the writer, in great\r\ndetail, in the state of Mississippi, from 1855 to 1872, and that state\r\nbeing from natural causes a peculiarly cogent illustration of such\r\ncorrelation: it seems advisable to describe first, somewhat in detail,\r\nthe facts observed there, and subsequently to compare them with what\r\nhas been observed elsewhere by him or others.\r\n\r\nNo claim is made to an even approximately exhaustive presentation of\r\nthe whole subject, even within the United States; nor is it intended\r\nto give complete lists of vegetation.[185] The object is to give such\r\nfacts as have been fairly well established by observation, hoping\r\nthat more thorough investigations in the same line will thereby be\r\nstimulated.\r\n\r\n[185] Such lists, so far as the State of Mississippi is concerned,\r\nmay be found in the writer’s Report on the Agriculture and Geology of\r\nMississippi, 1860.

It has a hilly surface,\r\n    and outside of the narrow valleys, the prevalent timber is\r\n    short-leaved pine and scrubby black-jack oak, with some post\r\n    oak and small black gum, and a few large chestnut trees.\r\n\r\n    _“Prairie” Belt._—Westward of this belt we descend\r\n    into a level “prairie” region, six to twelve miles wide;\r\n    the “white lime country,” having heavy black clay soils,\r\n    underlaid by the cretaceous “rotten limestones;” which are\r\n    profusely productive. The sparse tree growth consists of\r\n    stout, vigorous and dense-topped post and black-jack oaks,\r\n    with clumps of crab-apple, Chickasaw plum thickets, and an\r\n    occasional red cedar.\r\n\r\n    _Pontotoc Ridge._—West of the prairie belt we ascend\r\n    into a ridgy hill country, twelve to fourteen miles wide;\r\n    the “Pontotoc ridge,” formed of the soft limestones and\r\n    marls of the upper cretaceous formation, and covered with\r\n    a deep red soil, which bears a rich growth of oaks, with\r\n    hickory interspersed, and black walnut, umbrella and\r\n    tulip tree even on the ridges. This is one of the finest\r\n    agricultural regions of the State.\r\n\r\n    _Flatwoods._—From the Pontotoc ridge and its fine\r\n    lands and timber we descend to westward into the “Flatwoods”\r\n    belt, three to eight miles wide; a level country underlaid\r\n    by heavy gray non-calcareous clays of the tertiary\r\n    formation, from which most of its soil is directly formed.\r\n    It bears a pretty dense growth of the same species of oaks\r\n    that characterize the prairies farther east, but the form,\r\n    habit and size of the trees is so different that many of\r\n    the inhabitants believe them to be different species. The\r\n    black-jack oak looks like small, dense-topped apple trees;\r\n    the post oak, on the contrary, has an open top of the form\r\n    of a short-handled, spreading broom. The soil is poor and\r\n    unthrifty, as are the few disappointed settlers, who bought\r\n    the land on the strength of its oak-tree growth. (See page\r\n    500).\r\n\r\n    _Brown Loam Region. Table Lands._—Adjoining the\r\n    Flatwoods on the west is a broad upland region, with a\r\n    brownish-yellow soil and subsoil, extending nearly to the\r\n    edge of the Mississippi bottom. In its eastern portion\r\n    it is rather broken and hilly, with sandy ridge soils, a\r\n    mixed growth of oaks and short-leaved pine, and occasional\r\n    chestnuts; a fair farming country only. To westward the\r\n    ridges become lower and broader, assuming a plateau\r\n    character. The pine disappears, and black, Spanish, red and\r\n    white oak, with much hickory, largely replaces the black\r\n    jack and post oak; thus characterizing the fertile brown-loam\r\n    “table-lands” that extend through western Tennessee and\r\n    Mississippi into Louisiana, and have long been noted for\r\n    their high production of fine upland cotton.\r\n\r\n    _Cane Hills._—On the western border of the table-land\r\n    region, and here forming a strip only a few miles wide along\r\n    the edge of the Mississippi bottom, but from 70 to 450 feet\r\n    above it, lies the remnant of what farther south constitutes\r\n    a wide and important agricultural belt; the Bluff or Loess\r\n    formation, locally known as “the Cane Hills.” The soil is\r\n    largely composed of grains of sand and silt cemented by\r\n    lime carbonate; it is therefore calcareous, and as on the\r\n    Pontotoc ridge, described above, we find here the black\r\n    walnut, the tulip tree, ash and others, elsewhere restricted\r\n    to the alluvial “bottoms,” on the ridges themselves, from\r\n    sixty to a hundred feet above the stream beds.\r\n\r\n    _Mississippi Bottom._—At the western foot of this\r\n    bluff there lies the great Mississippi Bottom, with its\r\n    rich soils and varied forest growth. This also, however,\r\n    subdivides into at least three distinct soil and vegetative\r\n    zones, viz., the sandy “Frontlands,” which lie on the\r\n    immediate banks of the great river and its main branches,\r\n    and the heavy clayey “Back-land” areas, whose soils are\r\n    partly the product of modern swamp deposits from backwaters,\r\n    partly result from the disintegration of strongly calcareous\r\n    clays constituting the lower part of the Bluff or Loess\r\n    formation. A third natural subdivision is the “Dogwood\r\n    ridge,” a narrow belt of slightly elevated land, mostly\r\n    above ordinary overflows, which extends diagonally from the\r\n    Mississippi river to the Yazoo bottom, and seems to be the\r\n    continuation of “Crowleys ridge” in Arkansas. Each of these\r\n    soil belts has its own characteristic forest growth, as\r\n    indicated in the table below the map.\r\n\r\nWe have here along an east-and-west line of about 200 miles, eleven\r\nmarkedly distinct zones of vegetation, readily recognized as such by\r\nevery farmer, and each underlaid by a distinct geological terrane. It\r\ndoes seem as though a close study of these and of the soils overlying\r\nthem should lead to some definite results showing the physico-chemical\r\ncauses of these differences.\r\n\r\n_Lime apparently a governing Factor._—The connection of some of these\r\nchanges in vegetation with the calcareous nature of the corresponding\r\nformation has already been referred to. As regards four of the eleven\r\ndivisions, this is obvious even to the casual observer, and is well\r\nknown to the population, who speak of the “lime country” or belts\r\nbeing, as a matter of common knowledge, the best land; in full accord\r\nwith what, in Kentucky and elsewhere, has passed into a popular\r\nmaxim.[186]\r\n\r\n[186] “A lime country is a rich country.”\r\n\r\nTaking as a guide the trees and plants which characterize the obviously\r\ncalcareous lands, our next step should be to verify, if possible, the\r\nfact that wherever these occur naturally, lime is abundant in the\r\nsoil in comparison with those lands in which such vegetation does\r\nnot occur naturally, or perhaps even fails to flourish when planted\r\nwithout special fertilization. This the writer has sought to do,\r\nfirst in connection with the survey work of the state of Mississippi,\r\nand subsequently in the wider field that has since come under his\r\nobservation.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOIL BELTS IN SOUTHERN MISSISSIPPI.\r\n\r\nIn Mississippi, the general conclusions derived from the observations\r\nmade on the northern cross section, are corroborated many times over\r\nin other portions of the state. Aside from the cretaceous prairie\r\nregion, there runs across the middle of the state a belt of varying\r\nwidth, of calcareous tertiary beds, which also give rise to more\r\nor less extensive tracts of “black prairie” lands, interspersed\r\nwith non-calcareous, mostly sandy ridges, the lower slopes of\r\nwhich, influenced by the calcareous beds, bear an oak and hickory\r\ngrowth, while the higher portions have only pine, and usually remain\r\nuncultivated. Southward of this “central prairie” belt lies the\r\nlong-leaf-pine forest area of the state, underlaid throughout by\r\nsandy, non-calcareous formations, with poor sandy soils, save here and\r\nthere in patches, which can be at once recognized by the replacement\r\nof the long-leaved pine by a vigorous oak growth; as is also the case\r\nwhere the pine area abuts against the calcareous “Cane Hills” on the\r\nwest. The bottom soils of this region are largely “sour,” and bear\r\nthe gallberry (_Prinos glaber_), bay galls (_Persea Carolina_), ti-ti\r\n(_Cliftonia monophylla_), candleberry (_Myrica cerifera_), various\r\nwhortle-berries, the pitcher plants (_Sarracenia_), yellow star grass\r\n(_Aletris_), sundews, _Xyris_, _Eriocaulon_, and other plants of\r\nsimilar habits.\r\n\r\n_Vegetative and Soil Features of the Mississippi Coast Belt._—South of\r\nthe long-leaf pine area lie the coast flats, with sour, sandy soils\r\nunderlaid by stiff clays. On these “pine meadows” of the Mississippi\r\ncoast occur some of the most striking cases of modifications of\r\nvegetation due to physical and chemical causes.\r\n\r\nAs is well known, the long-leaved pine habitually belongs to the\r\ndry sandy uplands of the Gulf States; the deciduous cypress, on the\r\nother hand, is most characteristic of the swamps, where its roots\r\nare permanently submerged in water. But on the pine meadows of the\r\nMississippi coast we see these two incongruous trees growing side by\r\nside, though sadly worsted by their mutual concessions; their heights\r\nusually ranging from 12 to 15, rarely as much as 18 feet.[187] Yet\r\nboth preserve their characteristic forms, the cypress being an exact\r\nminiature reproduction of the usual level-topped swamp form, except\r\nas to the “knee” feature; while the pine differs only in stature from\r\nits giant brethren of the pine hills, from which it can be traced\r\ndown through all grades of transition. The soil on which this growth\r\noccurs is a sour, sandy one, one and a half to three feet in depth,\r\nunderlaid by a solid, impervious gray clay, above which is usually\r\nfound several inches of coffee-colored bottom water, which drains\r\nslowly into the sluggish water-courses, themselves carrying brownish,\r\nsour, but very clear waters. Analysis shows the soil to be sour and\r\nextremely poor, especially in its lime and phosphates (see chapter\r\n19, p. 352); its herbaceous vegetation consists exclusively of very\r\nsmall-seeded, “calcifuge” plants (sedges, orchids, Juncus, Hæmodoraceæ,\r\nXyris, Polygala, etc.). This land is wholly unproductive and affords\r\nbut indifferent pasturage, except the first season after burning-over;\r\nprobably because of the effect of the minute amount of ashes so added.\r\nAs the coast is approached, the clay subsoil has an increasing depth of\r\nsandy soil-mass above it, and on these “sand hammocks” the long-leaved\r\npine gradually assumes more and more of its usual stature; the cypress\r\ndisappears, and the Cuban pine (here called pitch pine) gradually comes\r\nin; while the sedgy vegetation diminishes and finally disappears. On\r\nthis land crops may be grown as in the long-leaf-pine uplands.\r\n\r\n[187] R. M. Harper, who has graphically described the vegetative\r\nfeatures of the coastal plain of Georgia (Contr. from the Dep. of\r\nBot. Colum. Univ. Nos. 192, 215, 216, 1902-05; also Bull. Torr. Bot.\r\nClub 29-32), claims the deciduous cypress of the wet pine-barrens and\r\nponds therein, the vegetation of which greatly resembles that of the\r\npine meadows of the Mississippi sea-coast, to be a distinct species,\r\n_Taxodium imbricarium_, the leaves of which are imbricated, instead of\r\ntwo-ranked and with spreading leaflets. He supports this distinction\r\nmainly by the differences in habit from the Louisiana swamp cypress,\r\nand the fact that the imbricated form occurs wholly on non-calcareous\r\nland, while the other is at home in the calcareous alluvial areas.\r\nThe imbricated form has been observed and commented on before, as a\r\nmere ecological variation, and in the writer’s opinion this is all\r\nthat can be claimed, in view of the much greater differences in the\r\nform of other trees, notably oaks, illustrated below, caused also by\r\nlime. There would, _à fortiori_, be reason for claiming at least three\r\ndifferent species of post oak and black-jack (and two of willow oak),\r\nwhich differ not only in tree form but also in the form and number\r\nof leaf lobes, and yet can be traced into one another by innumerable\r\ntransition forms. If new species are to be established on such grounds,\r\nit is hard to see where the variations manifestly due to environment\r\nare to come in.\r\n\r\nBut on the immediate coast, evidently under the influence of the\r\naboriginal “shell mounds,” the yellow sandy soil becomes blackish from\r\nthe (humus-forming) effect of the lime thus supplied; and concurrently\r\nthe coast live-oak (_Q. virens_), grape vines, the Hercules club\r\n(_Aralia spinosa_), “l’herbe a trois quarts” (_Verbesina sp._), and\r\nnumerous leguminous plants (which are wholly absent from the pine\r\nmeadows) take possession of the land, which is very productive and has\r\nbeen specially utilized in the growing of Sea Island cotton. Here the\r\nclay stratum is 15 to 20 feet below the surface, and roots penetrate\r\nto great depths in the pervious soil, whose great thickness makes up\r\nfor its low percentage of plant-food (see table below). This land is\r\ndistinctly limited by the extent of the shell heaps, past or present,\r\nand shows a respectable percentage of lime.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 78.—Schematic profile of the Mississippi Coast\r\nBelt, through Jackson County.]\r\n\r\nThe annexed schematic profile (fig. 78) illustrates these changes\r\nof soil and vegetation, which furnish a striking example of the\r\neffective modification of vegetative features by physical and chemical\r\nsoil-conditions.\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to find a more striking exemplification of the\r\neffect of lime carbonate, not only upon the vegetation but also upon\r\nthe physical and chemical characters of the hopelessly unproductive\r\nsoil of the sand hammocks and pine meadows; no longer brown and sour,\r\nbut jet black and neutral, modifying favorably every physical quality.\r\nHumus likewise nowhere shows its benefits more strikingly.\r\n\r\n_Table of Lime-Percentages._—The table below shows the average lime\r\npercentages observed in most of the several vegetative areas mentioned\r\nabove. To meet the objection sometimes made that the vegetative changes\r\nnoted may be due to the larger amounts of phosphoric acid and potash\r\nfrequently found in calcareous lands, the percentages of the latter are\r\nalso given. Considering the origin of limestones, such a connection\r\nis not unexpected, but it is far from constant. On the contrary, the\r\nfrequent co-occurrence of much lime and high production with small\r\npercentages of phosphoric acid and potash leads to the conclusion,\r\nalready discussed (see chapter 19, p. 365), that in presence of\r\nabundance of calcic carbonate, smaller percentages of phosphoric acid\r\nmay be considered adequate than when lime is deficient, on account of\r\ngreater availability. Almost the same may be said of potash; and it\r\nis quite possible that the presence of large amounts of lime tends\r\nto prevent the leaching-out of this base, in consequence of greater\r\nfacility for the formation of zeolites.

In fact, only two\r\nof the soils enumerated above would, according to the estimates\r\nusually given in books on soil composition, be considered as properly\r\ncalcareous. But the decisive feature in this matter must evidently\r\nbe the _native vegetation_, which expresses the nature of the land\r\nmuch more clearly and authoritatively than any arbitrary definition\r\nor nomenclature can possibly claim to do. _A soil must be considered\r\nas being calcareous whenever it naturally supports the vegetation\r\ncharacteristic of calcareous soils._\r\n\r\n    TABLE SHOWING NATIVE FOREST GROWTH, POPULAR ESTIMATE OF DURABILITY\r\n    AND INITIAL PRODUCTION, AND PERCENTAGES OF LIME, PHOSPHORIC ACID\r\n                  AND POTASH, IN MISSISSIPPI LANDS.\r\n    ===+==========+============================+=======================\r\n    No.|   Name.  |     Natural Vegetation.    | Production Per Acre.\r\n       |          |                            |\r\n    ---+----------+----------------------------+-----------------------\r\n       |   Black  |Mainly sturdy black-jack and|400 lbs. cotton lint,\r\n    172|  Prairie | post oak, red cedar, crab  | decreasing to 200 lbs.\r\n       |   Soil.  | apple and honey locust.    | in 30 years.\r\n       |          |                            |\r\n    ---+----------+----------------------------+-----------------------\r\n       |   Pale   |Scarlet, post and Spanish   |200 lbs. cotton first\r\n    164|   Yellow |  oak, small.               |  year, tailing off\r\n       |   Ridge  |                            |  to 75 to 100 lbs.\r\n       |   Loam.  |                            |  by 5th year.\r\n    ---+----------+----------------------------+-----------------------\r\n       | Pontotoc |Oak, hickory, walnut, sweet |350-400 lbs. cotton\r\n    226|  Ridge   |and black gum, honey locust.| lint, 300 lbs. after\r\n       |  Soil.   |                            | 20 years.\r\n    ---+----------+----------------------------+-----------------------\r\n       |   Heavy  |Post and black-jack oak,    |20 bushels of corn\r\n    230| Flatwood | and some short-leaved pine.| first year--then\r\n       |   Soil.  |                            | nubbins only.\r\n    ---+----------+----------------------------+-----------------------\r\n       |Black-Jack|Black-jack oak, pine,       |Unproductive.\r\n    345|   Ridge  |  huckleberry.              |\r\n       |   Soil.  |                            |\r\n    ---+----------+----------------------------+-----------------------\r\n       |  Oak and |Red and post oak, pig-nut   |200 lbs. cotton lint\r\n       |   Pine   | hickory, short-leaved pine.| at first; 100 lbs.\r\n    142|  Upland  |                            | 6-8 years.\r\n       |   Loam.  |                            |\r\n    ---+----------+----------------------------+-----------------------\r\n       |   Brown  |Black, post, Spanish and    |400 lbs. cotton--250\r\n    219|Table-land| black-jack oak, hickory,   | lbs. after 20 years.\r\n       |   soil.  | sweet and black gum.       |\r\n    ---+----------+----------------------------+-----------------------\r\n       | Bluff or |Cane, black and white oak,  |400 lbs. cotton,\r\n    237|  Loess   | tulip tree, linden,        | decreasing to 250 lbs.\r\n       |  Soil.   | sassafras.                 | after 30 years.\r\n    ---+----------+----------------------------+-----------------------\r\n       |“Buckshot”|Hickory, ash, sweet gum,    |800 lbs. cotton lint,\r\n    390|   Soil.  | pecan, cow oak, honey      | reduced to 500 lbs.\r\n       |          | locust, cane, crab-apple,  | in 30 years\r\n       |          | plum.                      | cultivation.\r\n    ---+----------+----------------------------+-----------------------\r\n       |   Pine   |Long-leaved pine, with      |20-30 bushels corn for\r\n    206|   Hill   |  scarlet and post oak,     | one year--then\r\n       |   Soil.  |  scattered small and       | nubbins.

Perhaps the most\r\nstriking example is that the cretaceous prairies and the adjoining\r\nflatwoods belt, standing respectively highest and lowest in the scale\r\nof productiveness, are yet bearing specifically identical tree-growth,\r\nto-wit, the post oak (_Quercus minor_) and the black-jack oak (_Q.\r\nmarylandica_). While to the field botanist[189] there can be no\r\nquestion as to the absolute specific identity of the two trees as\r\ngrowing on the respective areas, yet the mode of development of both\r\nis so different in the two cases, that, as before remarked they are\r\npopularly supposed to be different “kinds.”\r\n\r\n[188] It is a matter of regret to the writer that owing to the long\r\ndistance intervening and the difficulty of securing competent and\r\nsympathetic observers for such work, it has not been possible for him\r\nto secure photographs of the tree-forms here discussed. At the time his\r\nown observations were made, photography was practically unavailable as\r\nyet, and the figures given are therefore based upon sketches made at\r\nthe time, and partly upon recollection. They represent types rather\r\nthan definite individuals, which were however described when fresh in\r\nmind, in the Report on the Agriculture and Geology of Mississippi,\r\n1860, pages 254 et seq.\r\n\r\n[189] It has been already, and doubtless will be again and\r\nincreasingly, attempted to make distinct “species” of these widely\r\ndifferent forms of trees. But this is simply begging the question.\r\nMere external diagnostic marks will not avail here; it would have to\r\nbe shown that the seed of these different forms do not produce the\r\nother forms under changed conditions. Until this has been done, the\r\nnumber-less transition forms which he that runs may observe in the\r\nfield, throw upon the species-makers the onus of proof of differences\r\nof specific value—if it be possible to define such value.\r\n\r\n_Forms of the Post Oak._—The post oak of the prairie lands is a tree\r\n50 to 70 feet high, with a stout, excurrent, rather conical trunk,\r\noften somewhat curved to one side above, and densely clothed from\r\nwithin 12 or 15 feet of the ground with comparatively short, sturdy\r\nbranches set squarely to the trunk, much crooked (geniculate), often\r\nreflexed downward; altogether forming a dense head, beneath whose\r\nthick foliage, a bird or squirrel is quite secure from the hunter’s\r\naim.—In the flatwoods, on the contrary, the post oak has a thin, rather\r\nshort trunk, divided up at 15 or 20 feet height into long, rod-like\r\nbranches, spreading broom-fashion, and scantily clothed with short\r\ntwigs bearing tufts of leaves; thus forming an open head, in which no\r\ncreature can hide effectually. On the brown-loam table-lands, again,\r\nthe post oak has a straight, rather slender, excurrent trunk with long\r\nand more or less crooked limbs projecting at a large angle, sometimes\r\neven drooping, and freely divided up into lateral, leafy branches; the\r\ntrees attain from 40 to 55 feet in height. Again, on the high sandy\r\nridges which are interspersed in the eastern portion of the brown loam\r\narea, we find, generally associated with a similarly depauperated form\r\nof the black-jack oak, and with the Upland Willow oak (_Q. cinerea_), a\r\nform of the post oak intermediate between that of the Flatwoods and the\r\nTable lands; twelve to fifteen feet high, with thin trunk, “sprangling”\r\nlong, crooked branches, clothed with sparse tufts of leaves. These four\r\nstrikingly distinct types are shown schematically, in their extreme\r\ndevelopment, in the subjoined figures.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to say that between these extreme forms there\r\nare many degrees of transition, corresponding to the transitions\r\nbetween the several soil-classes respectively represented by them; or\r\nthey may be developed into depauperated types. Thus, for example, the\r\nforms of the post and black-jack oak found on the sandy ridges of the\r\nyellow loam region, hardly need experience in the observer to interpret\r\nthem as characterizing a wretchedly poor soil.\r\n\r\n_Forms of the Black-jack Oak._—Not less striking are the\r\ncharacteristics of the forms of the _black-jack oak_ as developed upon\r\nthese several kinds of land. The black-jack of the prairies is a low\r\ntree with a dense rounded head, often somewhat flattened above, and a\r\nlow, thick-set trunk divided up into square-set branches, so densely\r\nclad with foliage that no light penetrates into the interior, and birds\r\ncan safely hide and nest within it. The height rarely exceeds 35 feet,\r\nthe head being 20 to 30 feet across.\r\n\r\nThe Flatwoods form, on the contrary, rarely exceeds 15 feet in height,\r\nwith a very rough bark and a small, rather dense, rounded top, giving\r\nthe whole the appearance of a small apple tree. Practically the same\r\nform is seen on poor, clay ridges of “hog-wallow” land.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Loam Upland.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sandy Ridges.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Flatwoods.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Black Prairie.\r\n\r\nFIG. 79.—Extreme Forms of Post Oak (_Quercus minor Marsh., obtusiloba_\r\nMich.).]\r\n\r\nOn the brown-loam lands the black-jack, like the post oak, has a\r\nrather slender, often somewhat crooked, but excurrent trunk 35 to 50\r\nfeet high, with more or less crooked limbs of moderate length, well\r\nprovided with leafy branches, but forming altogether a rather open\r\ncrown. A depauperated form of this type occurs on the sandy ridges of\r\nthe yellow-loam region and is 12 to 15 feet high, with slender, crooked\r\nbranches, clothed with scanty foliage; as shown in Figure No. 80,\r\nalongside of the other typical forms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Loam Upland.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Flatwoods.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sandy Ridges.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Black Prairie.\r\n\r\nFIG. 80.—Extreme Forms of Black-Jack Oak (_Q. marylandica Mursh, nigra\r\nWangh_).]\r\n\r\nIn all these variations of the tree forms, there is also a concomitant\r\nvariation in the forms and other characters of the leaves. Thus in\r\nthe compact forms of the black-jack oak, the trilobate leaf is almost\r\ncompletely obliterated, the leaf being simply rounded-cuneate, somewhat\r\nauriculate at base. In the sparse-branched upland forms the leaves are\r\ndeeply three-lobed, and the ferruginous tomentum of the lower surface\r\nis much less pronounced. The lobation of the post oak also varies\r\nconsiderably both in the numbers of lobes and in their obtuseness.\r\nSimilar differences prevail in the case of the black and Spanish oaks;\r\nthus in the latter, the long terminal, falcate lobe is always most\r\npronounced on “rich” soils, while on poor ones the trilobate leaf\r\npredominates.\r\n\r\nOf course all these forms may be found bearing acorns, so that they\r\nundoubtedly represent adult trees.\r\n\r\n_Characteristic Forms of other Oaks._—Similar general features are\r\nrepeated in the case of the other species of oaks, and also more\r\nor less in other kinds of trees; though mostly less pronouncedly\r\nthan with the two species above described. Among the more striking\r\nare the two forms of the willow oak (_Q. phellos_), which on low,\r\nundrained ground assumes the low, rounded, “apple-tree” form, while on\r\nwell-drained uplands of good fertility it is a beautiful, slender tree\r\nproducing almost the effect of the acacia type; it is then a sign of\r\nfirst-class land. The scarlet oak rather reverses these types; on good,\r\n“brown-loam” upland it is of rounded form, not very tall, with sturdy,\r\nrough-barked trunk; while on poor hillside lands its tall, smooth,\r\nwhite trunk stands out as a conspicuous admonition to the land-seeker\r\nto beware of a poor purchase. The black and Spanish oaks also indicate,\r\nby tall thin trunks, a deterioration of the land as compared with the\r\nlower and more sturdy growth on areas relatively richer in lime.\r\n\r\n_Sturdy Growth on Calcareous Lands._—One feature invariably repeated,\r\nnot only in Mississippi but throughout the United States, is that _in\r\nmany strongly calcareous soils the growth of all trees, as well as of\r\nshrubs and of many herbaceous plants, is of a more sturdy and thick-set\r\nhabit_ than that of the same species grown on thin, sandy, or generally\r\non non-calcareous land. This effect is quite as apparent in the arid\r\nregion of the Pacific Coast as in the Atlantic States, on the prairies\r\nof the Middle West, and of the Gulf Coast. The experienced farmer\r\nrecognizes this habit of the tree-growth as a sign of good land, and\r\nthe reverse, viz., trees of lank, tall and thin growth, as evidence to\r\nthe contrary, from the Atlantic to the Pacific.\r\n\r\n_Cotton Plant._—The cotton plant affords very striking evidences of\r\nthis influence of lime. On the bottom lands of a creek in Rankin\r\ncounty, Mississippi, the writer found a “patch” of cotton with\r\nluxuriant stalks reaching above the head of a man on horseback, but\r\nalmost devoid of “squares” or blooms. The soil was very dark and\r\nrich-looking, but was derived from a non-calcareous tertiary terrane\r\nsurrounding the heads of the stream. A few rods below, the latter\r\ncrosses the line of a calcareous terrane, from which copious marly\r\ndebris have been washed down on the bottom soil. Here the cotton was\r\njust half as high as above, and thickly covered with squares, blooms,\r\nand bolls.\r\n\r\nAnother similar example was noted on the Chickasawhay river, in Wayne\r\ncounty, Miss. Where that stream flows through the non-calcareous,\r\nlignitiferous area of the tertiary formation, its bottom lands bear\r\ncotton crops of medium productiveness only, the stalks being of the\r\nusual height of about three feet, and only fairly bolled. But a short\r\ndistance below the point where the soft marls of the marine tertiary\r\nare cut into by the stream, the cotton plants on the bottom lands\r\nare from 18 to 20 inches high only, closely branched, and literally\r\nthronged with cotton bolls, so that the fields appear a solid mass\r\nof white. The only objection urged against this land is that to pick\r\nsuch cotton “breaks the backs” of the pickers. The tree growth of the\r\nbottom, of course shows a corresponding change.\r\n\r\n_Lime Favors Fruiting._—In connection with the obvious changes of\r\nform and stature caused by the presence of an abundant supply of lime\r\ncarbonate in soils, there is another that has been long noted in\r\ncultivation, but is no less striking in the native vegetation. The\r\nabundant fruiting of oaks on such lands as compared with the same\r\nspecies on non-calcareous soils is a matter of common note in the\r\nMississippi Valley states; and the same is true of other trees, and\r\nof herbaceous plants as well. The fruit on the lime soils is often\r\nsmaller, unless much humus is present; but the statement made in\r\nEurope that cultivated fruits, and especially grapes, are sweeter on\r\ncalcareous lands, is abundantly verified in the native fruits of the\r\nMississippi Valley states as well; where the various wild berries,\r\nhaws, plums, etc., are well known to the younger part of the population\r\nto be much sweeter and higher-flavored in certain (calcareous)\r\nlocalities than in others, besides being usually more abundant.\r\n\r\nThis is entirely in accord with the well-known fact that the\r\napplication of lime checks the excessive wood and leaf growth resulting\r\nfrom excess of nitrogen as well as moisture; while on the other hand,\r\nthe injurious effects of overdressing with lime or marl are known to\r\nbe repressed by the use of stable manure, or by green-manuring. The\r\nrepression of excessive wood growth by lime would seem to offer a\r\nsimple explanation of the compact habit of growth on calcareous lands;\r\nand the extraordinary sweetness of fruits grown in the arid region as\r\ncompared with the same in the humid, is fully in accord with the high\r\nlime-content of the arid lands.\r\n\r\n_Stunted Growth._—In practice it will be found in most cases that a\r\nstunted native growth is due not so much to lack of plant-food in the\r\nsoil, as to unfavorable physical conditions. Among these, _shallowness,\r\nand extreme heaviness_ of the soil are the most common causes. The\r\n“scab lands,” underlaid by impervious rock at a depth too slight for\r\nculture plants, as in many plateaus of the Pacific Northwest, and in\r\nrocky or mountainous regions generally, are cases in point. Strata of\r\nimpervious clay often produce the same result; but in this case, should\r\nsuch clay be intrinsically capable of supporting plant growth, the\r\nland can often be made available for orchard purposes by blasting with\r\ndynamite (see chapter 10, p. 181).\r\n\r\nThe post oak (and black-jack) flats of the Mississippi Valley states\r\nare familiar examples of land whose dwarfed tree growth causes it\r\nto be avoided by settlers; similarly, a dwarfed growth of red elm\r\n(_Ulmus rubra_), hackberry and ash indicates in the flood plain of\r\nthe Red river of Louisiana a heavy “waxy” red clay, or “gumbo” land,\r\nscarcely available for agricultural purposes.[190] The gray or white\r\n“cray-fishy” bottom and bench lands of the Southwestern States, so\r\npoor in lime, phosphates and humus as to be worthless under existing\r\nconditions, are characterized by an easily recognized scrubby growth of\r\nWater and Willow Oaks (_Q. nigra_, or _aquatica_, and _phellos_), with\r\nlow, rounded tops; while the same trees, when well developed, indicate\r\nhighly productive lands.\r\n\r\n[190] Rep. of Geological Reconnaissance of Louisiana; New Orleans,\r\n1873, p. 27.\r\n\r\n_Physical_ vs. _Chemical Causes of Vegetative Features_.—The extent\r\nto which the modifications of form alluded to above are referable to\r\nchemical and physical causes respectively, can be approached by the\r\ndiscussion of the presence or absence of certain trees from soils\r\nof extreme physical character, but otherwise normally constituted.\r\nAs has been shown above, the black-jack and post oaks belong, as\r\nspecies, equally to the heaviest and lightest soils within the state of\r\nMississippi; to the black and yellow “prairie” soils, as well as to the\r\nsandy ridges of the yellow-loam region; showing for these two species\r\nas such, an independence of physical conditions and an extraordinary\r\nadaptability, found in few other trees. They are frequently found\r\neither alone or associated with only a few other species of local\r\nadaptation, such as, in the prairie lands, the crab-apple, wild plum,\r\nand the juniper or red cedar. On the soils of intermediate or loam\r\ncharacter, on the contrary, they are always associated with other oaks\r\nas well as with hickory, and in that association attain what may be\r\nconsidered their normal type or form.\r\n\r\nFrom the fact that the dense, rounded top is formed by the black-jack\r\noak both on the rich prairie lands and on the poor soils of the\r\nFlatwoods, it would seem that that form is the outcome of a physical\r\ncause, viz., the extreme “heavy-clay” character of both kinds of land;\r\nand we may note that exactly the reverse effect is observed in the\r\nform growing on the poor sandy ridges, as shown in fig’s 79 and 80.\r\nYet it will also be noted that in the case of the post oak, the poor,\r\nheavy-clay soil of the Flatwoods produces an open, broom-shaped top,\r\nwhile the form assumed on the sandy ridges is substantially the same\r\nfor both species. Care must therefore be exercised in drawing general\r\nconclusions as to the effects produced by either physical or chemical\r\ncauses, _alone_, upon tree forms.\r\n\r\n_Lowland Tree Growth._—The variations occurring in the valleys or\r\nalluvial bottoms are less obvious to superficial observation, yet\r\nequally important and cogent to the close observer. In the properly\r\nalluvial lands, one dominant condition, that of _adequate moisture_\r\nsupply, is almost always fulfilled, irrespective of soil quality. In\r\naddition to this, as stated in chapter 2 (see page 24), practically all\r\nthe alluvial lands of the humid region may be considered as being of\r\na more or less _calcareous_ character, as compared with the adjacent\r\nuplands. These two important conditions dominate in a great measure the\r\nminor ones of variation in soil-texture. Yet where, as is largely the\r\ncase in the southern part of the State of Mississippi, the amount of\r\ncalcic carbonate is insufficient to overcome the sourness of the soil,\r\nthe vegetative contrasts become extremely striking and characteristic,\r\nas explained above.\r\n\r\n_Contrast Between “First” and “Second” Bottoms._—A very striking phase\r\nof transition between the alluvial bottoms and the uplands proper in\r\nthe Cotton States are the second bottoms or hammocks of the streams,\r\nwhose soil and tree-growth in most cases differ markedly from those\r\nof the first bottom; and these being usually closely adjacent, often\r\nafford a very striking contrast to the latter. From some antecedent\r\ngeological cause not fully understood, these hammocks, usually elevated\r\nfrom 4 to 10 feet above the present flood plain, have almost throughout\r\nsoils of a fine sandy, pulverulent or silty nature, frequently in\r\nstrong contrast to heavy clay soils in the first bottom.\r\n\r\nThey seem, moreover, to have been at some time subject to prolonged\r\nmaceration under water, resulting in the reduction of the ferric oxid,\r\nand its accumulation in the lower portion of the deposit in the form of\r\nbog-ore spots or “black gravel.” Since such a process always results\r\nin the abstraction of phosphoric acid from the general mass of the\r\nsoil, to be accumulated in the bog ore in an inert condition,[191]\r\nthese hammock soils, usually whitish or gray in color, are almost\r\nthroughout poor in phosphates as well as in lime; the latter having\r\nbeen definitively leached out. The resulting vegetation, as may be\r\nimagined, is widely different from that of the bottom proper, as well\r\nas, frequently, from that of the adjacent uplands; and though level and\r\nfair to see, these hammocks are usually unthrifty and last but a short\r\ntime under exhaustive cultivation. Accordingly, their forest growth\r\nis prevalently that of the poorer class of uplands, viz., small-sized\r\npost and black-jack oaks, and in the low ground depauperated water oak,\r\nor less commonly willow oak, of the low, stunted type indicative of a\r\nsoil of inferior productiveness. The luxuriant growth of the present\r\nalluvial bottom is often seen within a few feet of the unthrifty\r\nvegetation of these hammocks. It is usually only in the limestone\r\nregions, and in the lower course of the larger streams, that the\r\nhammocks or second bottoms are found to be of good fertility.\r\n\r\n[191] See Chapter 2, p. 24.\r\n\r\n_The Tree Growth of the First Bottoms. The Cypress._—Among the\r\ntrees occupying the low ground of the first bottom in the southern\r\nMississippi states, the deciduous cypress (_Taxodium distichum_)\r\ndeserves special mention as an example of extreme variation in form.\r\nIn sloughs and swampy tracts, as is well known, the cypress grows with\r\nroots submerged throughout the season, excepting only the excrescences\r\nknown as “knees,” which project above the water, probably performing\r\nsome function in connection with the aeration of the root, which is\r\nessential to the root functions in all plants. The trunk rising from\r\nthe water is supported by numerous projecting buttresses for from\r\n8 to 15 feet above the water; higher up it becomes cylindrical for\r\na height of from 40 to 70 feet, then divides up into a few widely\r\nspreading, thick, almost conical branches, whose twigs and foliage form\r\nan almost level surface to the head. This level-topped forest growth\r\ncharacterizes at once the submerged areas of the river and coast swamps.\r\n\r\nBut the cypress is by no means confined to the swamps and sloughs;\r\nit is also found occupying the better class of hammock lands, 12 or\r\n15 feet above water level. In this case, however, the tree assumes a\r\nshape and growth so wholly different from that described above as to\r\nlead to a popular assertion of a difference of species. As a matter\r\nof fact, however, the cones of these upland cypresses, when dropping\r\ninto the water below them, reproduce exactly the common swamp form.\r\nThe extraordinary difference in the aspect of the tree under these\r\ndifferent conditions is best seen in the subjoined diagram, showing\r\nthe upland cypress to assume the form of the tall willow oak, with\r\nwhich it is sometimes locally associated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Swamp.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Upland.\r\n\r\nFIG. 81.—Forms of Deciduous Cypress on overflowed and on bench-land.]\r\n\r\nThe trees from which the annexed sketch is taken grew within thirty\r\nfeet of each other, on Yellow creek, a small tributary of the Tennessee\r\nriver, in Tishomingo county, Miss. The soil stratum is underlaid by a\r\nshaly limestone, and bears lime vegetation.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the deciduous cypress grows without difficulty on the\r\nmoister class of lowlands in California, 12 or 15 feet above bottom\r\nwater, is of interest in this connection. It then assumes the upland\r\nform shown in the figure above, although not growing quite as tall. The\r\ncalcareous nature of these soils is probably an important factor in\r\nthis apparently incongruous adaptation of a subtropical swamp tree to\r\narid conditions. In its swamp form the cypress usually grows in rather\r\nshallow, heavy clay soil, into the dense subsoil of which the roots\r\npenetrate but little.\r\n\r\n_Other Lowland Trees._—The lowland hickories, like their brethren on\r\nthe highlands, seem on the whole to prefer the lighter or loamy bottom\r\nsoils to those of a heavier character. This is especially true of the\r\nPecan. The latter, as well as the shell-bark hickory, is especially\r\nindicative of the highest class of bottom soils. The black walnut,\r\nwhile apparently also best suited in loamy soils, is also more or\r\nless found on heavy bottom lands, provided they are sufficiently\r\ncalcareous; and the same is measurably true of the tulip or white-wood\r\ntree. The most frequent occupants of heavy bottom lands, however, are\r\nthe black gum and sweet gum, so that “gum swamps” are usually found\r\nto be of that character.[192] But in the prairie region, where the\r\nbottom soils are very calcareous and heavy, as well as in corresponding\r\nsoils of the “buckshot” lands of the great Mississippi Bottom, the\r\nchestnut-white (cow- or basket-) oak sometimes occupies such ground\r\nalmost exclusively. Among the accompanying trees are especially the\r\nhoney locust, the crab-apple, mulberry and sweet gum, as well as ash.\r\n\r\n[192] Hence perhaps the vernacular name “gumbo” for heavy, adhesive\r\nclay soils in the north central states; which may also, however, be\r\nderived from a comparison with the “gummy” pods of the cultivated okra\r\nor gumbo plant.\r\n\r\n_General Forecasts of Soil Quality in Forest Lands._—While the oaks and\r\npines mentioned as forming the bulk of the timber constitute in the\r\ncotton states the _primà facié_ evidence, as it were, of the general\r\ncharacter of the land, there are numerous other trees and plants which\r\nserve the discriminating land-seeker as a guide for the quality of\r\nthe soils in different localities. While everywhere, well-developed\r\nblack, red, Spanish and white oaks are considered as signs of a high\r\nquality of land, the tall, thin scarlet, the upland willow, and the\r\nbarrens scrub oak are considered as indications detracting materially\r\nfrom the producing value wherever they prevail. The various hickories\r\nare throughout considered as indicating good land when mixed with\r\nthe oaks, or by themselves; while the presence of walnut, linden and\r\ntulip tree will usually raise the estimate of uplands to the highest\r\nclass. On the other hand, the occurrence of small black-gum trees and\r\nshort-leaved pine, with low huckleberry, among the oaks of whatever\r\nkind, accompanied as they usually are by the disappearance of the\r\nblack, white and Spanish oaks, will materially depress the land-values.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of well-formed oaks, as well as of hickory, is therefore\r\nat once welcomed as an evidence of soil improvement, while that of\r\nlow huckleberry bushes and small black gums indicates the reverse. An\r\nincrease in the thickness and retentiveness of the soil stratum is\r\nalso usually indicated by the occurrence of short-leaved pine in the\r\nlong-leaf-pine areas.\r\n\r\nThe black, red, white, and Spanish oaks belong altogether to soils\r\nof medium physical constitution, only their _size_ upon such lands\r\ndepending upon the relative richness in plant-food; but without such\r\nchanges producing any notable variation in their _form_. Clearly\r\nthen, these species are intolerant of extreme physical conditions,\r\nand are practically restricted to soils of “loamy” character and easy\r\ncultivation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nRECOGNITION OF THE CHARACTER OF SOILS FROM THEIR NATIVE VEGETATION.\r\nUNITED STATES AT LARGE. EUROPE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe application of the above data outside of Mississippi can mostly be\r\nverified only in a fragmentary way from such data as are casually given\r\nin the reports of State Surveys, as well as from such observations as\r\nthe writer has been able to make personally elsewhere. In the latter\r\ncategory the most copious refer to the states of Alabama, Louisiana and\r\nIllinois.\r\n\r\nALABAMA.—The observations of Prof. Eugene A. Smith, and those of\r\nDr. Chas. Mohr, are especially valuable and cogent as to the close\r\ncorrespondence of the soil and vegetative phenomena with those\r\nobserved in Mississippi.[193] They are faithfully reproduced on the\r\ncorresponding geological areas, including also the Flatwoods. Northwest\r\nof Mobile, on the Mississippi line, the long-leaf-pine forest is\r\ninterspersed with more or less continuous areas bearing a fine oak\r\ngrowth, with hickories and other trees indicating a calcareous soil.\r\nThis feature is most extensively developed in Alabama in what is known\r\nas the “lime-sink region,” on the borders of which the vegetative\r\ntransition in passing from the non-calcareous sandy pine land, can be\r\nobserved in the most striking manner and with frequent alternations.\r\nNorthward of the long-leaf-pine belt, the tertiary and cretaceous\r\nareas show in Alabama the same features as in Mississippi, viz.,\r\nblack calcareous prairies alternating with ridge lands, among which\r\nin the cretaceous area the Pontotoc ridge is represented by a series\r\nof isolated knobs, popularly known as Chunnenugga ridge, closely\r\nresembling the former in its soils and vegetative character.\r\n\r\n[193] See Plant Life of Alabama, by Charles Mohr, Vol. VI. Contr. U. S.\r\nNat. Herb., U. S. Dep’t Agr.; Alabama Ed. of Same, Ala. Geol. Survey,\r\n1901.\r\n\r\nIn northern Alabama, according to Dr. Smith, on the various stages\r\nof the Carboniferous formation, ranging from a sandy or conglomerate\r\ncharacter to that of limestones of various degrees of purity, soils\r\ncontrast strikingly with each other, agreeing closely with those seen\r\nin the neighboring part of Mississippi. Here, moreover, the contrast\r\nbetween the natural vegetative character as well as cultural value\r\nof the lands derived from the magnesian limestones (the “barrens”)\r\ncontrasts strikingly with those originating in the purer limestones, on\r\nwhich the blue grass is at home.\r\n\r\nLOUISIANA.—As to Louisiana, whose geological formations correspond\r\nclosely to those of Mississippi, it may be said in general that the\r\nvegetative phenomena coincide completely with those observed in\r\nMississippi. The “white-lime country” of northeastern Mississippi\r\nis represented in Louisiana only by patches occurring here and\r\nthere on a line laid from Lake Bistineau to the coast at Petite\r\nAnse Island. But the chief characteristics of the calcareous area,\r\namong them especially that of the occurrence of red cedar and clumps\r\nof crab-apple, persistently reappear. The “Central Prairie Region”\r\nof Louisiana is quite narrow, but on it there reappear precisely\r\nthe same characteristics described in connection with that area in\r\nMississippi. In the long-leaf-pine region of Louisiana there occur,\r\nas in Mississippi, some isolated patches of a calcareous character,\r\nthe largest of which is on the Bayou Anacoco in Vernon Parish, near\r\nthe western border of the State. As we emerge from the sandy lands of\r\nthe long-leaf pine area to that underlaid by the calcareous formation,\r\nwe find, first, a change to oak and short-leaved pine, then the oak\r\nforest alone; finally, on a level black prairie of considerable\r\nextent, the post and black-jack oak in their thick-set form, clumps\r\nof crab-apple, red haw and honey locust, here and there a red cedar;\r\nexactly as has already been described in connection with the prairie\r\nlands of Mississippi. To southward of the long-leaf-pine area lies a\r\nbroad belt of level, generally treeless, sandy prairie, in part dotted\r\nwith groves of timber, but otherwise with nearly the same peculiar,\r\nsmall-seeded herbaceous vegetation observed in the corresponding\r\nportion of Mississippi. But in Louisiana there intervenes between these\r\ngray sour lands and the shell hammocks of the immediate sea-coast\r\nwith their groves of live-oak, a belt of black calcareous prairie,\r\nincreasing in width and clayeyness towards the West, and acquiring\r\nconsiderable extension in the corresponding portion of Texas. On these\r\nprairies we again find the calciphile vegetation, including the honey\r\nlocust, clumps of crab-apple and red haw, etc., but not usually any oak\r\ngrowth, except (near the sea-coast) the live-oak. In the hilly country\r\nof northern Louisiana there is reproduced substantially the vegetative\r\ncharacter of the “short-leaf pine and oak” uplands of Mississippi (see\r\nmap on p. 490, chapter 24), save in that, owing to the occasional\r\noutcropping of the calcareous materials of the Tertiary, small\r\nprairies with black soil are spotted about here and there. Bordering\r\nthe Mississippi Bottom there are a series of oak-upland ridges with\r\na brown loam soil corresponding to the fertile area in northwestern\r\nMississippi, with small patches of the “Cane hills” loess soils,\r\nbearing a corresponding tree growth.[194]\r\n\r\n[194] See “Final Report of a Geological Reconnoisssance of Louisiana,”\r\npublished by the New Orleans Academy of Science in 1871.\r\n\r\nIn _Western Tennessee_ the vegetative zones so distinctly shown in the\r\nadjacent portion of Mississippi are not so strikingly outlined, but\r\nso far as they do exist, the phenomena observed accord exactly with\r\nthose heretofore described. The same holds true of _Western Kentucky_,\r\nas is well set forth and graphically described in the reports of the\r\ngeological surveys of that state by Dr. David Dale Owen, and later by\r\nDr. R. H. Loughridge.\r\n\r\n_North Central States._—North of the Ohio River the materials of the\r\ngeological formations are not nearly as much varied as they are south\r\nof the same; consequently the vegetative features are also much more\r\nuniform. It must be remembered that from the Alleghenies nearly to\r\nthe Mississippi, the states of Ohio, Southern Michigan, Indiana and\r\nIllinois are largely covered by drift deposits overlying the older\r\nformations, except that along the Ohio and Mississippi rivers lies the\r\ncalcareous loam of the Loess or Bluff formation.\r\n\r\nWithin the states mentioned, however, not only are the older\r\nunderlying formations very generally calcareous, but calcareous sand\r\nand gravel form a large proportion of the drift deposits, which in\r\nmost cases overlie the rocks. Hence we find from the Alleghenies to\r\nthe Mississippi a predominance of the oak forests which characterizes\r\ncalcareous soils, as in the better class of uplands in Mississippi\r\nand Tennessee; interrupted only here and there by sandy belts or\r\nridges bearing inferior growth, among which, again, the black-jack and\r\npost oaks, with short-leaved pine, are conspicuous. But in a large\r\nportion of Illinois, as well as in Western Indiana, the oak forest\r\nis interrupted by more or less continuous belts, and sometimes by a\r\nwide expanse, of black prairie, generally treeless or bearing only\r\nclumps of crab-apple and haw, and underlaid more or less directly by\r\nthe carboniferous limestones, whose disintegration has materially\r\ncontributed to the black prairie soils; which are noted for their high\r\nand long-continued productiveness. The lower ground is characterized,\r\nbesides clumps of crab-apple and red haw, by the frequent occurrence of\r\nthe honey locust, the lead plant (_Amorpha fruticosa_), the button-bush\r\n(_Cephalanthus occidentalis_), and among herbs by the polar plant\r\n(_Silphium laciniatum_), the prairie burdock (_S. terebinthinaceum_),\r\nthe swamp rose-mallow (_Hibiscus moscheutos_), the sneezewort\r\n(_Helenium autumnale_), the wild indigo (_Baptisia tinctoria_ and\r\n_leucophcæa_).\r\n\r\nThe black-jack and post oak are not nearly as frequently found on\r\nthe prairies of Illinois as on those of Mississippi and Alabama; but\r\nwhere they occur they assume a similar habit, including the occurrence\r\nof the dwarfed, apple-tree-shaped form on the low ridges with heavy\r\nyellow clay soil, that sometimes intersect the prairies. The post oak,\r\nmoreover, in a form quite similar to that described as occurring on\r\nthe Flatwoods of Mississippi, forms the timber of the “post oak flats”\r\noccasionally found between the low ridges bordering the streams, or\r\nalong the edges of the prairies. The herbaceous vegetation of these\r\npost oak flats distinctly characterizes them as being poor in lime. In\r\nthe loamy uplands, where the calcareous ingredient is more abundant,\r\nthe open-headed form of the black-jack and post oak are also found,\r\ninterspersed with a luxuriant growth of black, red and white oak, with\r\nmore or less of hickory, which here assume a magnificent development,\r\nmuch superior to that seen south of the Ohio. These yellow-loam uplands\r\ncorrespond very closely in their soil-composition and agricultural\r\ncharacter to the brown-loam area of Mississippi and Tennessee, which\r\nlies inland from the Loess belt. Where these uplands approach the\r\nprairie or the outcrops of a limestone formation, there is usually\r\nadded to the oak growth the linden, the wild cherry and the ash; the\r\nlatter two also usually appear in the bottoms of the streams and on the\r\nslopes adjacent, together with the walnut and butternut, and in the\r\nlowest ground the sycamore.\r\n\r\nThe tree growth of the Loess belt bordering the Ohio and Mississippi,\r\nso far as climatic differences permit, agrees almost precisely with\r\nthat described in the corresponding portions of Mississippi and\r\nTennessee. The change from the oak and hickory growth covering the\r\nyellow-loam uplands toward the more calcareous area is evidenced by\r\nthe appearance of large sturdy trees of sassafras, together with\r\nthe linden and sugar maple. Descending from the “bluff” toward the\r\nrich bottom-prairie with its black, heavy soil, we at once encounter\r\nthe familiar indices of the more highly calcareous land, viz., the\r\nhoney locust, clumps of crab-apple and red haw, with hackberry,\r\nKentucky coffee tree and mulberry on the lower ground. In late summer\r\nand during autumn, a tall growth of the iron weed (_Vernonia_),\r\nseveral _Eupatoriums_ (_E. perfoliatum_ and _purpureum_, the white\r\nand the purple boneset) and of the blue-spiked _Verbena_ are very\r\ncharacteristic, as are also several species of _Cassia_ (Carolina\r\ncoffee, etc.,) and the swamp rose-mallow.\r\n\r\n_Upland and Lowland Vegetation in the Arid and Humid Regions._—In\r\nthe humid countries there is commonly a marked difference between\r\nthe vegetation of the uplands and lowlands, arising not merely from\r\nthe difference in the moisture supply, but evidently of a specific\r\nnature. When we discuss the characteristic plants in detail, it becomes\r\nobvious that it is _lime_ vegetation that, in most cases, forms the\r\ncharacteristic differences between upland and lowland forest growth; a\r\nnatural consequence of the leaching-down of the lime from the higher\r\nland to the lower levels. By way of counter-proof we find that when\r\nthe uplands themselves are of a calcareous nature, a part at least\r\nof the lowland flora ascends into them. As prominent examples may\r\nbe mentioned the Tulip tree (_Liriodendron_), black walnut, ash,\r\nKentucky coffee tree, Hercules’ club, etc., which are lowland trees\r\nover the greater part of their area of occurrence; but in the loess\r\nor Cane hills bordering the Mississippi and its larger tributaries,\r\nas well as in the limestone regions of the southwestern and western\r\nstates, are conspicuous in the uplands as well. The tall southern\r\ncane (_Arundinaria macrosperma_), usually considered a plant of the\r\nlow river bottoms, originally covered the loess or “Cane hills” of\r\nthe lower Mississippi, with their highly calcareous soils. The same\r\nis true of many other trees and shrubs characterizing limy lands. Of\r\ncourse there are some whose habitat is dependent upon the concurrent\r\npresence of _both_ lime and moisture, such as the sycamore, cottonwood,\r\nhackberry, pawpaw, etc., which are naturally found only in stream\r\nbottoms or on low hammocks.\r\n\r\nIn the arid region, on the contrary, the main difference in upland\r\nand lowland vegetation is (outside of mountain influences) entirely\r\nreferable to moisture-conditions; the proof being that so soon as the\r\nuplands are irrigated the lowland flora takes possession. Both uplands\r\nand lowlands being abundantly calcareous, there then is no cause for\r\nany material differences. This substantial uniformity of upland and\r\nlowland plant growth is particularly striking in the comparatively\r\nrestricted floras of Eastern Oregon and Washington, and in Montana,\r\nwhere the more luxuriant growth of the valleys is almost the only\r\ncontrast seen when their vegetation is compared with that of the\r\nuplands adjacent.\r\n\r\n_Forms of Deciduous Trees in the Arid Regions._—Since, as shown above,\r\nthe soils of the arid regions are almost throughout calcareous, we\r\nshould expect that the forms of the native trees would in general\r\nconform to the rule given above. As regards the deciduous trees this\r\nis very generally true: We rarely see on the Pacific slope, south of\r\nOregon, anything to compare with the tall oaks of the Atlantic forests.\r\nThe native oaks are as a rule of low, spreading growth, with stout,\r\nshort trunks; and as they rarely form dense forests, the timbered areas\r\nhave an orchard-like appearance, characteristic of the landscapes of\r\nthe arid region, from the Mezquit Plains of Texas to Eastern Oregon\r\nand Washington. Only where a very abundant supply of moisture prevails\r\ndo we find occasional exceptions. The trees of the humid region when\r\ntransplanted to California have a perverse tendency to branch low, so\r\nthat only the most persistent trimming-up will induce them to form\r\ntrunks at all like those found in their native climes. In some cases\r\nno amount of trimming will result in the formation of anything more\r\nthan bushes.\r\n\r\nIt may be objected that the arid climate as such, and not the\r\ncalcareous nature of the soil, is the cause of this tendency. It is\r\nunquestionable that this low-branching habit is a distinct advantage to\r\nthe plants, whose trunks would otherwise be frequently scorched by the\r\nhot summer sun; as happens when Eastern settlers try to grow “standard”\r\nfruit trees, with the result that a “sore,” or sunburnt streak is\r\nformed on the southwest side of the exposed trunk. All orchard trees\r\nshould therefore be pruned “vase-shape” in arid climates, partly for\r\nthis, partly for other reasons. But this cannot explain the fact that\r\nseedlings from eastern acorns act precisely as do acclimated trees; so\r\nthat it is not a case of the survival of the fittest to endure arid\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\n_Tall Growths of Conifers._ Moreover, while the rule holds good with\r\nalmost all deciduous trees, it is not applicable to the Conifers; which\r\nin the case of the Sequoias (redwoods and “big-trees”), sugar pine and\r\nothers, exemplify some of the tallest growths known in the world. The\r\nEastern Cedar or Juniper grows tall only on sufficiently calcareous\r\nsoils, and in the Mississippi Valley states at least, wherever it\r\noccurs is an unfailing indication of calcareous lands. The extended\r\noccurrence of the spruce on the Allegheny Ranges, where limestone\r\nformations prevail so largely, seems to indicate a similar preference\r\nfor calcareous lands. And this is certainly true of the black locust,\r\nwhich reaches its extreme southern range in the cretaceous hills of\r\nNortheastern Mississippi, showing the stout, stocky form it also\r\nassumes when planted in the calcareous black-prairie lands of Illinois.\r\n\r\n_Herbaceous Plants as Soil Indicators._ While herbaceous plants are not\r\nas generally considered by land-seekers in judging of soil fertility\r\nand character, it goes without saying that very many are quite as\r\ncharacteristic as the tree vegetation, especially when deep-rooting, so\r\nas not to indicate merely the character of a few inches of surface soil.\r\n\r\nIn the Middle West of the United States especially, a large number\r\nof the Compositæ serve as marks of high productive capacity. This is\r\nparticularly true of the larger species of the sunflower tribe, among\r\nwhich _Helianthus grosse-serratus_ and _doronicoides_ are perhaps the\r\nmost generally notable; while farther west, beginning with Kansas, the\r\n“Sunflower State,” and its northern neighbor, _H. annuus_, whether\r\nnative or introduced, becomes conspicuous also. The _Silphiums_\r\n(compass sunflowers) have nearly the same significance, _S. laciniatum_\r\nand _perfoliatum_ being prominent on the prairies of Illinois and\r\nIndiana; but in land under cultivation they are mostly replaced by a\r\nluxuriant growth of the Ragweed, _Ambrosia trifida_. Various species\r\nof _Bidens_ (beggar ticks), notably the _B. aristata_ and _cernua_,\r\naccompany the true sunflowers in the lower grounds of these regions,\r\nas do also _Heliopsis laevis_, _Coreopsis triperis_ and _Rudbeckia_\r\n(_Obeliscaria_) _pinnata_. _Rudbeckia hirta_ and _purpurea_, though\r\nalso occurring on rich soils, are not characteristic of them. The\r\nlarger species of golden rods (_Solidago_), notably _S. canadensis_,\r\n_rigida_ and _speciosa_ (not ordinarily distinguished by farmers) share\r\nsubstantially the distribution of the large sunflowers mentioned above.\r\nOf the Asters, only _A. novæ-angliæ_ serves as a reliable guide to\r\nhigh-class lands in the Middle West,[195] but a very copious growth of\r\nasters and solidago of various species is always a welcome indication\r\nof land quality, and indicates soils of good lime content, if not\r\nabsolutely calcareous.\r\n\r\n[195] In view of its specific designation and the reputed poverty of\r\nNew England soils, this is rather unexpected.\r\n\r\n_Leguminous Plants._—It is generally understood that most leguminous\r\nplants, and among them especially the clovers, indicate rich, or\r\nrather, calcareous lands. The very large proportion of lime contained\r\nin the ash of legumes at once creates this presumption, which is\r\nfully confirmed by experience so far as our ordinary culture plants\r\nof that relationship are concerned. The favoring effect of lime on\r\nthe development of bacteria, so essential to the full development of\r\ncultivated legumes, has already been referred to. The favoring effect\r\nof gypsum sown even in small amounts with clover and other legumes, may\r\nprobably be referable to the known action of that salt in promoting\r\nnitrification, which in the first stages of leguminous growth is so\r\nhighly favorable to a vigorous and early start of the crop, and to\r\na more copious production of the nitrogen-assimilating nodules. The\r\nquick change noted in meadows and pastures of languishing production\r\nso soon as moderately limed, by the appearance of clover among the\r\nherbage, at once reminds us that the Rhizobia do not flourish in acid\r\nlands. The great prevalence of leguminous plants of all kinds in the\r\narid region—clovers (not fewer than twenty-three species in California\r\nalone), Lupins, Astragalus and related genera, at once remind us of the\r\nuniversal prevalence of calcareous soils in these regions, as shown\r\nabove. _Mutatis mutandis_, we find precisely the same general facts in\r\nthe arid regions of the other continents.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it must be kept in mind that not all plants of the\r\nleguminous order are positively “calciphile.” Within the United States,\r\nit is especially the genera _Desmodium_ (_Meibomia_) and _Lespedeza_,\r\nwhich are very numerously represented in the long-leaf pine region\r\nof Mississippi, where the soils are so poor in lime. Whether under\r\nthese conditions these plants develop the rhizobian nodules, has not,\r\nso far as the writer is aware, been definitely observed. Certain it\r\nis that quite a number of these plants occur on both calcareous and\r\nnon-calcareous soils, and on the latter assume a much more vigorous\r\ndevelopment than in the pine woods. But it is evident that they, with\r\na few others (_e. g._ _Galactia mollis_, _Cassia chamæcrista_ and\r\n_nictitans_) are more or less _indifferent_ to the lime-content of\r\nsoils, and cannot therefore be relied upon in judging the quality of\r\nlands. In Mississippi and northern Alabama, the _Tephrosia virginica_\r\n(“devil’s shoestring”), associated with chestnut and short-leaved\r\npine, is characteristic of the poorest non-calcareous lands, and bears\r\nseeds but very scantily. It disappears so soon as calcareous lands are\r\napproached, together with the chestnut tree.\r\n\r\n\r\nEUROPEAN OBSERVATIONS AND VIEWS ON PLANT DISTRIBUTION AND ITS\r\nCONTROLLING CAUSES.\r\n\r\nThe writer has thus far presented and discussed mainly his own\r\nobservations made in the United States, without reference to the\r\nprevious and contemporaneous work on the same subject in Europe. There\r\narose certain discrepancies which could not well be explained without a\r\nprevious full consideration of American conditions.\r\n\r\nAs is well known, for nearly twenty years the accepted theory in\r\nEurope was that of Thurman,[196] which attributes the distribution of\r\nthe native floras entirely to physical conditions; thus anticipating by\r\nmore than half a century the corresponding hypothesis lately brought\r\nforward by the U. S. Bureau of Soils. Thurmann classes plants simply\r\nas hydrophile and xerophile, thus differing from most of our modern\r\necologists merely in omitting the transition phase of “mesophytes,”\r\nwhich now serves as a convenient pigeon-hole for an indefinite variety\r\nof plants.\r\n\r\n[196] Essai de Phytostatique appliquée à la chaine du Jura et aux\r\ncontrées voisines. 2 vols. 8vo. Berne, 1849.\r\n\r\nWhile gradually many were led by their observations to doubt\r\nthe correctness of Thurmann’s exclusive physical theory, Fliche\r\nand Grandeau[197] were apparently the first to impair by their\r\ninvestigations the confidence in the accepted view. They investigated\r\nexhaustively the conditions under which the maritime pine and the\r\nchestnut tree, both antagonistic to lime, would flourish, and proved\r\nthat the presence of any considerable amount of lime in the land would\r\ncause them to languish or die, although the physical conditions so far\r\nas ascertainable were exactly alike. It is interesting to note what\r\nwere the lime-percentages which caused these differences; viz., for the\r\n“non-calcareous” soil and subsoil, respectively, .35 and .20%; for the\r\ncalcareous land, 3.25 and 24.04%, the latter evidently being decidedly\r\n“marly.” The composition of the ash of these trees is very instructive,\r\nand is therefore given in full. Alongside of the ash of the maritime\r\npine on the two soils is given that of the Corsican pine, a lime-loving\r\ntree.\r\n\r\n    COMPOSITION OF PINE ASHES ON CALCAREOUS AND NON-CALCAREOUS LANDS.\r\n    -----------------+-------------------------------+--------------\r\n                     |        MARITIME PINE,         | CORSICAN PINE,\r\n                     |        PINUS PINASTER.        |PINUS LARICIO.\r\n    -----------------+-----------------+-------------+--------------\r\n                     |On non-calcareous|On calcareous|On calcareous\r\n                     |      soil.      |    soil.    |    soil.\r\n                     |                 |             |\r\n    Potash           |      16.04      |     4.95    |     13.56\r\n    Soda             |       1.91      |     2.52    |      2.24\r\n    Lime             |      40.20      |    56.15    |     49.13\r\n    Magnesia         |      20.09      |    18.80    |     13.49\r\n    Ferric Oxid      |       3.83      |     2.07    |      3.29\r\n    Silica           |       9.18      |     6.42    |      7.14\r\n    Phosphoric acid  |       9.00      |     9.14    |     11.33\r\n    -----------------+-----------------+-------------+--------------\r\n              Total  |     100.25      |   100.04    |    100.18\r\n    -----------------+-----------------+-------------+--------------\r\n      Ash per cent.  |       1.32      |     1.54    |      2.45\r\n    -----------------+-----------------+-------------+--------------\r\n\r\n[197] Annales de Chimie et de Physique, 4me série, tome 29; ibid. 5me\r\nsérie, Tome 2. Also, ibid, tome 18, 1879.\r\n\r\n    It is very interesting to note in these analyses the inverse\r\n    ratio in the absorption of potash and lime by the maritime\r\n    pine, which seems to be unable to defend itself against\r\n    excessive absorption of lime and thus experiences a dearth\r\n    of potash which naturally interferes with the formation of\r\n    starch and chlorophyl; hence probably induces the chlorosis\r\n    so well known to occur on excessively calcareous soils. The\r\n    lime-loving Corsican pine takes up a larger total amount of\r\n    ash and more phosphoric acid, and nearly three times as much\r\n    potash, but considerably less lime than did the maritime\r\n    pine on the same calcareous soil.\r\n\r\n    The corresponding analyses made by Fliche and Grandeau,\r\n    of the leaves and wood of chestnut grown on the same two\r\n    kinds of soils, gave in general the same results; and\r\n    they add that the smaller content of iron absorbed by the\r\n    calcifuge trees when grown on calcareous soil point also\r\n    to a deleterious influence upon the normal formation of\r\n    chlorophyl.\r\n\r\nFollowing Fliche and Grandeau, Bonnier[198] made corroborative tests by\r\nsowing seeds of the same plants, both calciphile and calcifuge, upon\r\nthe two kinds of soils, and noting the differences in their mode of\r\ngrowth and internal structure.\r\n\r\n[198] Bull. de la Société Botanique de France, tome 26, 1879.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Calciphile, Calcifuge and Silicophile plants._\r\n\r\nThe subject has been somewhat exhaustively discussed by Contejean[199]\r\nwho enumerates and has classified under the three general heads of\r\ncalciphile, calcifuge and indifferent, over 1700 species of European\r\nplants. Unfortunately he had but few soil analyses at his disposal,\r\nand was inclined to consider as non-calcareous, most soils that gave\r\nno effervescence with acids. But notwithstanding this disadvantage so\r\nfar as his contention of the efficacy of chemical soil-composition,\r\nand especially of lime is concerned, he disproves very effectually\r\nthe physical theory of Thurmann, by numerous examples from France\r\nand elsewhere in Europe; and also disposes very definitely of the\r\nclaim that there is a special class of “silicophile” plants. He\r\nconcludes that silica (and sand) is merely a neutral and inert medium\r\nwhich offers refuge to the plants “expelled” by lime; and that clay\r\nsimilarly exerts no chemical but only a purely physical action.\r\nThat potash, phosphoric acid and nitrogen, while most essential\r\nas plant-foods, exert otherwise little if any effect on general\r\nplant distribution. He alludes similarly to magnesia; and his final\r\nconclusion is that “chemical are in general more potent than physical\r\ninfluences,” and that the most widely active influences are carbonate\r\nof lime and chlorid of sodium. He does not, of course, deny the potent\r\ninfluence of moisture upon plant distribution.\r\n\r\n[199] Geographie botanique. Influence du terrain sur la vegetation.\r\nBaillère et Fils, Paris, 1881, 143 pp.\r\n\r\nSince these publications were made, many observers have investigated\r\nthe subject, and the broad distinction between lime-loving\r\nor calciphile and lime-repelled or calcifuge plants has been\r\nvery generally recognized and discussed: but the cause of this\r\ndiscrimination by plants is still more or less the subject of\r\ncontroversy. Some still claim that the calcifuge plants (such as the\r\nchestnut, the huckleberries and whortle-berries, the heather and many\r\nother Ericaceæ, most sedges, etc.) are repelled by calcareous lands\r\nbecause they need a large supply of silica, which they suppose cannot\r\nwell be assimilated in presence of much lime; hence they also designate\r\nthe calcifuge plants as “silicophile”; while others attribute the\r\npreference of calciphile plants to the physical effects produced upon\r\nthe soil by lime, as outlined above (chapter 20, page 379).\r\n\r\nThe contention that the presence of much lime in soils renders silica\r\ninsoluble and hence unassimilable by plants, is at once negatived\r\nby the fact that waters exceptionally rich in silica, partly simply\r\ndissolved by carbonic acid, partly in the form of water-soluble\r\nalkali-silicates, are very abundantly found in the arid region. This\r\nis especially the case in California, where moreover a number of\r\nspecies of very rough-surfaced horsetail rushes and grasses prove the\r\nready absorption of silica when wanted, even in strongly calcareous\r\nsoils. But the question is whether the supposed class of silicophile\r\nplants is a reality or merely a theoretical fiction, based upon the\r\nhabit of speaking of “siliceous” soils as a class apart from other and\r\nespecially heavier or clay soils. As a matter of fact, the siliceous\r\nsoils usually so called are simply those poor in clay and lime—in other\r\nwords, “light” lands, the outcome of the weathering of quartzose rocks\r\ninto sandy soils, which in the humid region are always poor in lime\r\nbecause thoroughly leached. In the arid region, on the contrary, sandy\r\nlands are quite commonly just as calcareous as the heavier soils, and\r\nshow no “silicophile” flora.\r\n\r\nAccording to the writer’s observations and views, it being obvious that\r\nsome plants are practically indifferent to the presence or absence\r\nof lime in the soil except in so far as it influences favorably\r\nthe physical conditions, _moisture_ must always stand first as the\r\ncondition of maximum crop production, and as a _conditio sine qua non_\r\nof the best development of plants on all kinds of soils; its best\r\nmeasure being a matter of special adaptation to each species. But\r\nthis being understood, he agrees with Contejean as to the commanding\r\ninfluence of lime in determining the adaptation of soils to plants,\r\nboth cultivated and wild. At the same time, it is obvious that the\r\nabsence of the opportunity to observe _really_ native vegetation,\r\nadapted to the soils through ages, has created for European observers\r\ndifficulties which are readily solved where original native floras are\r\navailable.\r\n\r\nSchimper[200] says pointedly that observations prove that the\r\ndifferences between the location of plants on calcareous and siliceous\r\nsoils are not constant, but vary from province to province; that _e.\r\ng._, the list of indifferent (bodensteter) plants for the Alps do\r\nnot hold good in the Dauphiné, still less between the Carpathians\r\nand Skandinavia. According to Wahlenberg the following species are\r\ncalciphile in the Carpathians, and according to Christ indifferent\r\nin Switzerland: _Dryas octopetala_, _Saxifraga oppositifolia_, most\r\nof the leguminous species, _Gentiana nivalis_, _G. tenella_, _G.\r\nverna_, _Erica carnea_, _Chamæorchis alpina_, _Carex capillaris_.\r\n_Geum reptans_ is reported by Bonnier to be exclusively calciphile on\r\nMont Blanc, exclusively silicophile in the Dauphiné; indifferent in\r\nSwitzerland. A great number of similar contradictions are reported by\r\nothers as well, and the entire subject thus becomes rather vague; so\r\nthat Schimper and others suggest that climatic conditions may in part\r\nbe responsible for these discrepancies.\r\n\r\n[200] Pflanzengeographie, p. 111 & ff.\r\n\r\nIn all, or nearly all these cases, it is tacitly assumed that the\r\nunderlying geological formation has essentially been the source of\r\nthe soil, and that its character is determined accordingly. But this\r\nassumption is wholly arbitrary unless confirmed by actual direct\r\nexamination. A soil-formation overlying limestone on the slopes of a\r\nrange may be wholly derived from non-calcareous formations lying at a\r\nhigher elevation, or may have been leached of its original lime-content\r\nby abundant rains. The feldspars constituting rocks designated as\r\ngranite, may or may not be partially or wholly of the soda-lime instead\r\nof the potash series; the mica may or may not be partially replaced by\r\nhornblende, in which cases the soil would be calcareous to the extent\r\nof determining the character of the flora as calcifuge or calciphile,\r\nwithout its being at all evident in the physical character of the soil,\r\nwhich would still be “granitic” or “siliceous.” Such observations in\r\norder to be critically decisive, clearly require that the observer\r\nshould be, not merely a systematic botanist, nor a mere geologist or\r\nchemist, but all these combined. There is good reason to believe that\r\nmost or all of these supposed contradictions would disappear before a\r\ncritical physical and chemical examination of both the soils and the\r\nrocks from which they are supposed to have been derived. Contejean\r\nhimself, in placing so many of his long catalogue of plants into the\r\ndoubtful groups, suggests many cases in which the above considerations\r\nmay explain the apparent discrepancies.\r\n\r\n_What is a calcareous soil?_ The definition adopted for this volume\r\nhas been given in a previous chapter (chapter 19, page 367); viz,\r\nthat _a soil must be considered calcareous so soon as it naturally\r\nsupports a calciphile flora_—the “lime vegetation” so often referred\r\nto above and named in detail. Upon this basis it has been seen that\r\nsome (sandy) soils containing only a little over one-tenth of one per\r\ncent of lime show all the characters and advantages of calcareous\r\nsoils; while in the case of heavy clay soils, as has been shown, the\r\nlime-percentage must rise to over one-half per cent to produce native\r\nlime growth. While in the United States observations of the contrasts\r\nbetween calciphile and calcifuge floras are easily made in the field,\r\nand the facts must attract the attention of any fairly qualified\r\nobserver, in Europe they would have to be made the subject of special\r\ncultural investigation based upon soil analysis; a procedure not yet\r\nfully accredited abroad, any more than in the United States. In a\r\ngeneral way it has however been recognized by Maercker, as shown at the\r\nend of the preceding chapter. How far this estimate was based upon\r\nAmerican precedents, can now be only conjectured. Certain it is that\r\nthe European definition of calcareous soils remains to the present\r\nday a wholly different one from that stated above; and from this have\r\narisen the greater part of the doubts and differences of opinions among\r\nEuropean botanists as to the classification of plants in relation to\r\ncalcareous soils. Two per cent of lime (equivalent to nearly double\r\nthe amount of carbonate) is the prevailing European postulate for a\r\ncalcareous soil. Some go so far as to postulate effervescence with\r\nacids, requiring about 5% of the carbonate.\r\n\r\n_Predominance of Calcareous Formations in Europe._—It is not generally\r\nrecognized even among geologists how abnormally predominant are\r\n_limestone_ formations in Europe. In all works on European agriculture\r\nwe find the “lime sand” mentioned as a normal ingredient of soils,\r\nspecially provided for (or against) in the operations of soil\r\nexamination. Its presence is the rule, its absence the exception.\r\nSoils as poor in lime as are those of the long-leaf and short-leaf\r\npine regions of the United States, are there very exceptional and\r\n(like the “Haideböden” of northern Germany) have long remained almost\r\nuncultivated. Calcareous soils being the rule in the regions of intense\r\nculture, the ideas of both agriculturists and agricultural chemists\r\nhave in Europe, in the main, been based upon them as normal soils; so\r\nthat instead of comparing calcareous, and non-calcareous soils properly\r\nspeaking—_i. e._, such as would not bear native lime-vegetation—the\r\nmajority of comparisons has actually been made between soils which, in\r\nthe American sense, were all or chiefly within the calcareous class. It\r\nis characteristic of this state of things that the injuriousness of an\r\n_excess_ of lime is among the foremost themes of European (especially\r\nFrench and English) agricultural writers, as against the beneficent\r\neffects prominently assigned to lime in America. No such popular\r\nsaying as that “a lime country is a rich country” exists in Europe;\r\non the contrary, we constantly hear, and see in books, the mention of\r\n“poor chalk lands,” and in France especially the deleterious effects\r\nof excess of lime upon crops is the theme of remark. Excess of lime\r\nin their marly lands has been the despair of French vintners, and\r\nViala was specially sent to America to find some vine to serve as\r\na grafting stock which would resist the tendency to chlorosis which\r\nrenders many of the American phylloxera-resistant vines useless to the\r\nviticulturists of France. Viala did not find such grapevines until he\r\nreached the cretaceous (chalk) area of Texas, where the native vines\r\nhad long ago adapted themselves to marly soils; and these vines have\r\nsolved the problem for French viticulture.\r\n\r\nAnd England, France, Belgium and most of western Europe _are_ rich\r\ncountries, largely owing to their abundant limestone formations; and\r\nit may be questioned whether, had this been otherwise, Europe would so\r\nlong have remained the center of civilization; for starving populations\r\nare not a good substratum for high mental culture and progress. It\r\nmay equally be asked whether the invariably calcareous character of\r\narid soils, as heretofore shown, has not, together with their general\r\nhigh quality, been largely a determining factor in the location and\r\npersistence of so many ancient civilizations in arid lands; as outlined\r\nin chapter 21, page 417. In this connection, the proper distinction\r\nbetween calcareous and non-calcareous soils passes from the domain of\r\nnatural science to that of the history of human civilization.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nTHE VEGETATION OF SALINE AND ALKALI LANDS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Marine Saline Lands._—While the saline alluvial lands of the sea-coast\r\ndiffer both in their mode of origin and in their nature from the alkali\r\nsoils or “terrestrial saline lands,” as they have been called in\r\nEurope, their vegetation has in many respects a common character. Not\r\nonly is there much similarity, sometimes even identity, in the kinds\r\nof plants inhabiting these lands, but their saline ingredients induce\r\ncertain changes of form and structure in plants not properly “saline”\r\nbut more or less tolerant of soluble salts, by which the saline or\r\nalkali character of the lands may be recognized.\r\n\r\nJust as in the case of lime we must distinguish between the plants\r\ndefinitely repelled by a large amount of this substance in the soil\r\n(calcifuge), while others prefer the soils in which lime is abundant\r\n(calciphile), and still others appear to be indifferent to its presence\r\nand are governed in their habitat by the physical conditions presented:\r\nso in the case of saline lands the salts may attract or repel certain\r\nplants. The latter class is much the largest; while there is also a\r\nnumber of plants which are more or less indifferent to the presence\r\nof salts, provided these be not in very great excess. Such plants\r\nconstitute the next-largest class; while those attracted by salts, and\r\nwhose welfare is conditioned upon their presence, are comparatively few\r\nin number, and still fewer among them are of economic importance. Hence\r\nthe soluble salts have largely a negative importance for agriculture;\r\nthe question usually being how to utilize the land until the\r\nundesirable surplus of salts can be got rid of, partially or wholly, as\r\nthe case may be; the former usually in seashore lands, the latter in\r\nthe alkali lands proper; in which a small remnant, not sufficient to\r\ninjure crop plants, is usually desirable (see chap. 23, p. 462).\r\n\r\n_General Character of Saline Vegetation._—Those familiar with seashore\r\nmarshes cannot fail to note the fleshiness and succulence of the\r\ncharacteristic plants. This “incrassation” belongs not only to the\r\nsaline flora proper, but is acquired to a greater or less degree when\r\nplants not ordinarily at home on saline ground are transferred to it\r\nartificially, or by saline overflows; while at the same time the leaves\r\nusually become smaller, and the growth more compact. Correspondingly,\r\nwhen saline plants are transferred to non-saline ground, the leaves\r\ngenerally become thinner and larger, and the growth more slender. The\r\nwell-known “Russian thistle” is a case in point, as is also its close\r\nrelative, the soda saltwort (_Salsola soda_); although the latter does\r\nnot often venture as far from the saline lands as does the former\r\n(_Salsola kali tragus_), which now seems to have become a world-wide\r\nweed, with only a shade of preference for alkali lands.\r\n\r\n_Structural and Functional Differences Caused by Saline Solutions._—It\r\nhas been definitely shown by the investigations of Schimper, Brick,\r\nHoffmann, Lesage, Rosenberg and others, that the peculiarities or\r\nchanges of structure brought about by saline solutions are essentially\r\nthose pertaining to xerophile (drought-enduring) vegetation; which in\r\ngeneral tend to the diminution of evaporation from the plant surfaces.\r\nIt may be said, roughly speaking, that the absorption of water by the\r\nroots begins to diminish so soon as the concentration of the saline\r\nsolution approaches or exceeds one-half of one per cent; while when\r\nit rises as high as three per cent, water-absorption by the roots\r\nceases even in the wettest soils, and the plant suffers from drought\r\nquite as much as from any directly injurious effects of the salts.\r\nDifferent plants of course differ in the measure of concentration which\r\nbrings about these phenomena, which vary also with the character of\r\nthe soluble salts. It is stated that injurious or useless salts like\r\ncommon salt act at lower concentrations than _e. g._, saltpeter, which\r\nis useful. The difference in external structure are: diminution of the\r\nsize of leaves, assumption of cylindrical or spinous forms, sinking-in\r\nof the breathing pores below the outer surface, dense hairy covering,\r\nresinous exudations, etc. Internally we find that xerophile plants have\r\ndeveloped on their upper or outer leaf-surfaces instead of one, several\r\nlayers of “palisade” (long and erect, closely-packed) cells, through\r\nwhich transpiration is extremely slow, as is also the transmission\r\nof heat. When salt-tolerant plants are grown on saline soils, their\r\npalisade cells are relatively lengthened.\r\n\r\nCoincident with these external means for the retardation of\r\nevaporation, the leaves of xerophiles are frequently supplied\r\nwith special water-storage cells, which supply moisture for the\r\nphysiological processes when the root supply falls short. The cactus\r\ntribe and similar-looking plants are examples of the latter provision,\r\nwhich causes even animals suffering from thirst to resort to them,\r\nalthough they eschew the saline vegetation.\r\n\r\n_Absorption of the Salts._—The true halophytes or exclusive salt\r\nplants, which refuse to grow on lands not containing a large\r\nproportions of salt, often absorb so much salt that on drying it blooms\r\nout on their surface; they usually have, even when green, a distinctly\r\nsalty taste, and their ash is rich in chlorids, specially of sodium.\r\nSuch is the case of the samphire, common in saline marshes everywhere.\r\nThe total ash is usually very high, often varying with the salinity of\r\nthe water or soil in which they have grown. Thus the salt-content of\r\nthe ash of samphire may vary by several per cent. In other cases, as in\r\nthat of one of the Australian saltbushes investigated at the California\r\nstation, neither the ash content nor the composition of the ash varies\r\nmaterially whether the plant be grown on strong alkali land, or on\r\nuplands whose total saline content does not exceed (in four feet depth)\r\n.015% or 2500 pounds per acre.\r\n\r\nThe following table gives the composition of the ash of this saltbush\r\nalongside of that of two other prominent alkali-plants of the same\r\nrelationship, occurring, one in the San Joaquin valley of California,\r\nin strongly saline lands, the other in the Great Basin region of the\r\ninterior, on lands strongly impregnated with carbonate of soda. All\r\nthese, it will be seen, take up very large amounts of sodium salts,\r\nnotably the chlorid; the Australian plant most so, the “greasewood” of\r\nthe Great Basin least so; a large proportion of the alkali salts being\r\nevidently, in the latter case, contained in the form of organic salts,\r\nwhich in the ash become carbonates.\r\n\r\n\r\n              ANALYSES OF ASHES OF SALINE AND ALKALI PLANTS.\r\n\r\n    (A) = Australian Saltbush, Atriplex semibaccata.†\r\n    (B) = Bushy Samphire,  Allenrolfea occidentalis.†\r\n    (C) = Greasewood, Sarcobatus vermiculatus.†\r\n    (D) = Saltgrass, Distichlis spicata.‡\r\n    (E) = Tussock grass, Sporobolus airodies.‡\r\n    (F) = Prickly Pear, Opuntia macrocentra.‡\r\n    ========================+======+======+======+======+======+======\r\n                            | (A)  | (B)  |  (C) |  (D) | (E)  |  (F)\r\n    ------------------------+------+------+------+------+------+------\r\n    Ash, air-dried plant, %.| 19.37| 12.03| 13.81| 11.61|  7.99| 24.18\r\n    ------------------------+------+------+------+------+------+------\r\n    Potash (K₂O)            | 11.42| 18.53| 30.11|  3.30|  5.78|  1.61\r\n    Soda (Na₂O)             | 35.39| 39.45| 32.58|  2.38|  5.15|  2.76\r\n    Lime (CaO)              |  5.75|  1.36|  8.70|  5.25|  8.05| 65.66\r\n    Magnesia (MgO)          |  3.23|  1.09|  1.09|  2.95|  4.15| 26.70\r\n    ------------------------+------+------+------+------+------+------\r\n    Br. ox. of Manganese    |      |      |      |      |      |\r\n               (Mn₃O₄)      |   .22|      |      |   .16|   .25|\r\n    ------------------------+------+------+------+------+------+------\r\n    Peroxid of Iron (Fe₂O₃) |  3.33|  7.06| not  |  2.22|  2.39|  1.19\r\n    Alumina (Al₂O₃)         |      |      |det’d.|      |      |\r\n    ------------------------+------+------+------+------+------+------\r\n    Silica                  | 16.24| 11.81|  4.00| 78.73| 66.79|   .81\r\n    Phosphoric acid (P₂O₅)  |  2.80|  3.51|  5.60|   .83|  1.25|   .47\r\n    Sulfuric acid (SO₃)     |  2.64|  4.93|  5.90|  3.20|  4.52|   .64\r\n    Chlorin, percent        | 24.33| 15.30| 11.00|  1.40|  2.13|   .21\r\n    ------------------------+------+------+------+------+------+------\r\n          Totals            |105.35|103.04| 99.79|100.31|100.46|100.05\r\n      Less excess, O: Cl    |  5.35|  3.25|  2.50|   .31|   .46|   .05\r\n    ------------------------+------+------+------+------+------+------\r\n          True totals       |100.00| 99.79| 97.29|100.00|100.00|100.00\r\n    ------------------------+------+------+------+------+------+------\r\n\r\n    (G) = Shad scale, Atriplex canescens.‡\r\n    (H) = Alfalfa Hay.

St’n. Rept. 1894-95, p. 169.\r\n      ‡ Goss, New Mex. St’n. Bull. No. 44; recalculated.\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that the saltbush hay contains nearly one-fifth of\r\nits (air-dry) weight of ash, of which nearly 40% is common salt. It\r\ntherefore has a distinctly salty taste, and is always moist to the\r\ntouch, containing-ordinarily over 15% of moisture. It is therefore much\r\nliked by stock when fed intermixed with other hay, and thus supplies\r\nall the salt needed by cattle. The greasewood is much less liked by\r\nstock, and bushy samphire is wholly rejected by them. Comparing with\r\nthese fleshy plants the ash of the two grasses, the first a world-wide\r\n“salt grass,” the other a common grass of the American arid region,\r\nwe note that not only do they contain much less soluble ash than the\r\nsaltbushes, but especially much smaller amounts of sodium salts;\r\nproving that even when growing in company with the saltbushes on\r\nstrongly impregnated land, they can repel from absorption these to them\r\nuseless or injurious salts. But in the case of the “shad scale,” also a\r\n“saltbush” of the Great Basin, the ash-content is remarkably low—only\r\nabout one-fifth of that of its Australian relative—and it differs\r\nwidely from the latter in having but a very low proportion of soda,\r\nand a very high one of lime and potash, approaching in these respects\r\nto our usual forage crops; and being also fairly rich in nitrogen, it\r\nforms acceptable browsing when other pasture plants are scarce. It\r\ntherefore does not exert the laxative action produced by the exclusive\r\nfeeding on the more saline herbages.\r\n\r\nThe exceptionally high ash-content of the cactus or prickly pear, also\r\ngiven in the table, arises, it will be noted, not from the soluble\r\nsalts but from the absorption of extraordinarily high proportions of\r\nlime and magnesia. Owing probably to the latter substance, and also the\r\noxalate form in which lime is usually found in the cactus tribe, this\r\nplant when used as forage is also somewhat laxative.\r\n\r\nAltogether, this table offers remarkable examples of wide differences\r\nin the kind and amount of ash ingredients absorbed by plants growing\r\nupon similar soils and under identical climatic conditions; indicating\r\na selective power which no merely physical theory of soil-action in\r\nplant growth can explain.\r\n\r\n_Injury to Plants from the Various Salts._—The early observers,\r\nespecially Contejean, were predisposed from their observations of lime\r\non vegetation to ascribe the action of salt upon marine vegetation\r\nto the sodium component. But the wide differences in the effects of\r\ndifferent sodium compounds, notably of common salt and Glaubers salt,\r\nled some to the conclusion that the acidic ingredients are the chief\r\ndetermining factors. Moreover, it was soon found that a single salt is\r\nmore injurious than a mixture of several, such as sea water. This also\r\nled to the inference that the varying degree of dissociation of these\r\nsalts essentially influences the effects.\r\n\r\n    Kearney and Cameron have investigated these relations,[201]\r\n    and have by artificial cultures in solutions of varying\r\n    concentration and composition studied the behavior of plant\r\n    roots and the limits of their endurance. They found for the\r\n    several salts occurring in alkali soils, taken separately,\r\n    the following figures, in 100,000 parts of water:\r\n\r\n       Magnesium sulfate          7\r\n          “      chlorid         12\r\n       Sodium carbonate          26\r\n          “    sulfate           53\r\n          “    chlorid          116\r\n          “    bicarbonate      167\r\n       Calcium chlorid        1,377\r\n\r\n[201] Report No. 71, U. S. Dep’t. of Agriculture, 1902.\r\n\r\n    It will be noted that in many respects the results given in\r\n    this table stand in marked contrast to the facts observed\r\n    in alkali lands everywhere; and therefore while interesting\r\n    physiologically, are not directly applicable to practice.\r\n    Magnesium sulfate, which according to this table is the most\r\n    injurious of all, is a common ingredient of alkali lands\r\n    from Wyoming to New Mexico, as also is sodium sulfate; yet\r\n    there, as well as in the Musselshell valley in Montana, and\r\n    at many other points, it shows no specially deleterious\r\n    action either upon native or cultivated plants, and in\r\n    Europe as well as in New England the mineral kieserite is\r\n    freely used as a fertilizer at many points. That sodium\r\n    sulfate should be twice as harmful as sodium chlorid or\r\n    common salt, and half as harmful as the carbonate or black\r\n    alkali, is again wholly contrary to actual experience,\r\n    which as shown elsewhere in this chapter, indicates that\r\n    the majority of plants will tolerate between three and four\r\n    times as much of sodium sulfate as of common salt; while the\r\n    ratio of tolerance as against the carbonate seems sometimes\r\n    to rise as high as ten to one.\r\n\r\n    It is clearly evident, however, that it is the metallic or\r\n    basic ingredient that in the main determines the toxicity of\r\n    these salts. The universal presence of lime in some form in\r\n    all alkali lands doubtless explains the discrepancies\r\n    mentioned, since lime is especially potent in counteracting\r\n    the injurious effects; thus throwing additional light upon\r\n    the importance of the lime-content of alkali soils proper,\r\n    and also upon the causes of the narrow limitations of\r\n    the littoral (marine saline) flora; inasmuch as, unlike\r\n    alkali soils, marine alluvial lands are by no means\r\n    always calcareous. Cameron goes so far as to attribute\r\n    the favorable effects of gypsum upon black alkali not so\r\n    much to the conversion of the latter into neutral sulfate,\r\n    as to the effect of gypsum solution in counteracting the\r\n    saline effects. This interpretation, however, seems rather\r\n    far-fetched, since there can be no question about the double\r\n    decomposition of gypsum with carbonate of soda; or the\r\n    intense injuriousness of carbonate of soda in the actual\r\n    corrosion of vegetable tissues. The corresponding protective\r\n    influence of various salts, more especially of those of\r\n    lime, against the injurious effects of pure common salt on\r\n    marine animals, has already been mentioned (chapter 20, page\r\n    380), and later investigations by Osterhout on marine algæ,\r\n    show the same relation to hold true for them also.\r\n\r\n_Reclamation of Marine Saline Lands for Culture._—The reclamation of\r\nsea-coast lands and marshes for agricultural use is based in general\r\nupon the same methods as those already outlined for alkali lands in\r\nchapter 20; except that in this case no chemical neutralization is\r\npossible, since common salt cannot be changed by any practically\r\nfeasible means. It must be removed by leaching, and this, in the humid\r\ncountries in which such reclamations have chiefly been made, is usually\r\ndone by the agency of rains, aided by ditching. The “polder” lands thus\r\nreclaimed along the shores of the North Sea, from Belgium to Prussia,\r\nare especially esteemed for their productiveness, doubtless owing to\r\nthe alluvium of the numerous rivers tributary to that sea, which is\r\ndistributed along its shores and in the numerous inlets and bays. The\r\ntides are of course excluded by dikes provided with gates opening\r\noutward, so as to permit of the outflow of rain- or irrigation-water\r\nused for leaching purposes.\r\n\r\nOut of reach of stream alluvium no exceptional fertility is to be\r\nexpected of seashore lands, which then commonly assume the form of sand\r\ndunes or bars, incapable of nourishing any cultural vegetation. Of the\r\nlatter, the groups listed below as tolerant of alkali salts, may also\r\nbe considered with reference to reclaimed seashore lands; the first\r\ncereal to succeed being usually barley, the first root crop, beets.\r\nAsparagus is also available while salt is being leached out.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VEGETATION OF ALKALI LANDS.\r\n\r\nThe general character of alkali-land vegetation is not unlike that of\r\nsaline seashore lands; some species of plants are common to both, but\r\nthe alkali lands harbor a much greater variety of plants, owing to\r\nthe differences in climates and soils as well as to the nature of the\r\nimpregnating salts. Moreover, owing to the very causes which underlie\r\nthe presence of these salts, viz, aridity, the xerophile or dry-land\r\ncharacter of the alkali-land flora is much more pronounced than that of\r\nthe saline seashore vegetation. In view of the very complex conditions,\r\nthe discussion of the alkali-flora is of necessity much more complex\r\nthan that of the marine group; and the data for its full elucidation\r\nwith respect to the nature of the soils and salts are as yet very\r\nincomplete.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECLAIMABLE AND IRRECLAIMABLE ALKALI LANDS AS DISTINGUISHED BY THEIR\r\nNATURAL VEGETATION.\r\n\r\nWhile, as shown above (chapter 20), the adaptation or non-adaptation\r\nof particular alkali lands to certain cultures may be determined by\r\nsampling the soil and subjecting the leachings to chemical analysis, it\r\nis obviously desirable that some other means, if possible available to\r\nthe farmer himself, should be found to determine the reclaimability and\r\nadaptation of such lands for general or special cultures.\r\n\r\nIn alkali lands, as in others, the natural plant-growth affords\r\nsuch means, both as regards the quality and quantity of the saline\r\ningredients. The most superficial observation shows that certain plants\r\nindicate extremely strong alkali lands where they occupy the ground\r\nalone; others indicate pre-eminently the presence of common salt;\r\nthe presence or absence of still others form definite or probable\r\nindications of reclaimability or non-reclaimability. Many such\r\ncharacteristic plants are well known to and readily recognized by the\r\nfarmers of the alkali districts. “Alkali weeds” are commonly spoken\r\nof almost everywhere; but the meaning of this term—_i. e._, the kind\r\nof plant designated thereby—varies materially from place to place,\r\naccording to climate as well as the quality of the soil. It is obvious\r\nthat if these characteristic plants were definitely observed, described\r\nand named, while also ascertaining the amount and kind of alkali they\r\nindicate as existing in the land, lists could be formed for the several\r\nregions, which would indicate, in a manner intelligible to the farmer\r\nhimself, the kind and degree of impregnation with which he would have\r\nto deal in the reclamation work; thus enabling him to go to work on the\r\nbasis of his own judgment, without previous chemical examination.\r\n\r\nA study of the lands of California having this purpose in view, was\r\nundertaken in the years 1898 and 1899 by the California Station; but\r\nlack of funds prevented its prosecution beyond the ascertainment\r\nof those plants the abundant occurrence of which prove the land\r\nto be irreclaimable without the use of the universal remedy, viz,\r\nunderdrainage, which on the large scale is usually beyond the means\r\nof the land-seeker. The botanical field work and collection of soil\r\nsamples was carried out by Mr. Jos. Burtt Davy; the chemical work,\r\nas heretofore, being done by Dr. R. H. Loughridge. The results here\r\nreported are therefore essentially their joint work. It is hoped that\r\nin the future, a more comprehensive study and close comparison of\r\nthe native vegetation with the chemical determination of the quality\r\nand kind of alkali corresponding to certain plants, or groups of\r\nplants, naturally occurring on the land, may enable us to come to a\r\nsufficiently close estimate of the nature and capabilities of the\r\nlatter from the native vegetation alone, or with the aid of test plants\r\npurposely grown, for the farmers’ purposes.\r\n\r\n_Plants Indicating Irreclaimable Lands._—The plants herein-after\r\nmentioned and figured are, then, to be understood as indicating,\r\n_whenever they occupy the ground as an abundant and luxuriant growth_,\r\nthat such land is irreclaimable for ordinary crops, unless underdrained\r\nfor the purpose of washing out surplus salts. The occurrence merely of\r\nscattered, more or less stunted individuals of these plants, while a\r\nsure indication of the _presence_ of alkali salts, does not necessarily\r\nshow that the land is irreclaimable.\r\n\r\nThe plants which may best serve as such indicators in California are\r\nthe following:\r\n\r\n    Tussock-grass (_Sporobolus airoides_ Torr.), Fig. 82.\r\n\r\n    Bushy Samphire (_Allenrolfea occidentalis_ [Wats.] Ktze.),\r\n    Fig. 83.\r\n\r\n    Dwarf Samphire (_Salicornia subterminalis_ Parish, and\r\n    other species), Fig. 84.\r\n\r\n    Saltwort (_Suaeda torreyana_ Wats., and _S. suffrutescens_,\r\n    Wats.), Fig. 85.\r\n\r\n    Greasewood (_Sarcobatus vermiculatus_ [Hook.] Torr.),\r\n    Fig. 86.\r\n\r\n    Alkali-heath (_Frankenia grandifolia campestris_ Gray),\r\n    Fig. 87.\r\n\r\n    Cressa (_Cressa truxillensis_ Choisy), Fig. 88, perhaps\r\n    identical with _C. cretica_ auct.\r\n\r\n    Saltgrass (_Distichlis spicata_), Fig. 89.\r\n\r\nTUSSOCK-GRASS (_Sporobolus airoides_, Torr.); Fig. 82.\r\n\r\n(“Bunch grass” of New Mexico).\r\n\r\nThe three sets of Tussock-grass soil which have been analyzed show\r\nthat the total amount of all salts present is in no case less than\r\n49,000 pounds per acre, to a depth of four feet; and that it sometimes\r\nreaches the extraordinarily high figure of 499,000 pounds. Of these\r\namounts the neutral salts (Glauber’s salt and common salt) are usually\r\nin the heaviest proportion (Glauber’s salt, 19,600 to 323,000 pounds\r\nper acre; common salt, 3,500 to 172,800); the corrosive salsoda varying\r\nfrom 3,000 to 44,000 pounds.—Tussock-grass apparently cannot persist\r\nin ground which is periodically flooded. It is of special importance\r\nbecause it is an acceptable forage for stock.\r\n\r\nTussock-grass is a prevalent alkali-indicator in the hot, arid portions\r\nof the interior, from the upper San Joaquin Valley, the Mojave desert,\r\nand southward; also through southern Nevada and Utah as far east as\r\nKansas and Nebraska. In the San Joaquin Valley it has not been found\r\nfarther north than the Tulare plains, although east of Reno it occurs\r\nnear Reno. Coville observes that in the Death Valley region “it is\r\nconfined principally to altitudes below 1,000 meters” (3,280 feet).\r\nHillman, however, reports it from near Reno, Nevada, at an altitude\r\nwhich cannot be much less than 4,500 feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 82.—Tussock-Grass—_Sporobolus airoides_ Torr.]\r\n\r\nThe tussocks formed by this grass, which are unfortunately not shown in\r\nthe figure, sometimes appear as veritable little grass trees, and when\r\ndenuded by the browsing of cattle seem like trunks 18 and 20 inches\r\nhigh. It is therefore very easily recognized; but it should be noted\r\nthat in view of the extraordinary range of its tolerance, shown above,\r\nits scattered occurrence does not necessarily indicate irreclaimable\r\nland.\r\n\r\nBUSHY SAMPHIRE. (_Allenrolfea occidentalis_ [Wats.] G. Ktze.) FIG. 83..\r\n\r\nThis plant is locally called greasewood, but as this name is much more\r\ncommonly used for _Sarcobatus vermiculatus_, it seems best to call\r\nAllenrolfea “bushy samphire,” as it closely resembles the true samphire\r\n(_Salicornia_).\r\n\r\nBushy Samphire usually grows in low sinks, in clay soil which in\r\nwinter is excessively wet, and in summer becomes a “dry bog.” Wherever\r\nthe plant grows luxuriantly the salt content is invariably high, the\r\ntotal salts varying from 327,000 pounds per acre, to a depth of three\r\nfeet, to 494,520 pounds in four feet. The salts consist mainly of\r\nGlauber’s and common salts (a maximum of about 275,000 pounds each);\r\nsalsoda varies from 2,360 to 4,800 pounds per acre. The percentage\r\nof common salt and total salts is higher than for any other plant\r\ninvestigated, and the content of Glauber’s salt is also excessive.\r\nThe areas over which this plant grows must therefore be considered\r\namong the most hopeless of alkali lands, for although its salts are\r\n“white,” submergence during winter precludes the growth of Australian\r\nsaltbushes. Full underdrainage alone could reclaim the soil-areas it\r\noccupies. Bushy Samphire is common on low-lying alkali lands in the\r\nupper San Joaquin Valley, California, and extends northward along the\r\neastern slopes of the Coast Range to Suisun Bay. It is also abundant in\r\nthe Death Valley region, apparently overlapping the southward range of\r\nthe _Sarcobatus_, the greasewood properly so-called.\r\n\r\nDWARF SAMPHIRE (_Salicornia subterminalis_, Parish, and other species\r\nof the interior); Fig. 84.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 83.—Bushy Samphire—_Allenrolfea occidentalis_ (S.\r\nWats.) G. Ktze.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 84.—Salicornia subterminalis. Alkali samphire.\r\n\r\nA. Much-branched form.\r\n\r\nB. Slender form.\r\n\r\nC.

The flowers are\r\nimpressed in the joints in opposite clusters of three. In each cluster\r\nthe middle flower stands slightly above the two laterals as shown in\r\nthe lower joint.]\r\n\r\nThe three or four species of Dwarf Samphire which grow in the interior\r\nvalleys of the State are not usually very abundant, save locally.\r\nWherever the species do occur, however, they may be considered as\r\nindicating excessively saline soils. Dwarf Samphire soil has shown\r\na total salt content of 441,880 pounds per acre in a depth of four\r\nfeet. The neutral Glauber’s salt amounts to 314,000 pounds, almost\r\nas much as in Tussock-grass soil; common salt up to 125,640 pounds\r\nwhile the salsoda varies from 2,200 to 12,000. We may consider the\r\nplant as indicative of almost the highest percentage of common salt,\r\nGlauber’s salt and total salts. Like the preceding species it indicates\r\nland strongly charged with salts, more especially common salt, and\r\nsusceptible to cultivation only after reclamation by underdrainage.\r\n\r\n_Salicornia subterminalis_, _S. herbacea_ (L.), _S. mucronata_, and\r\nanother species, all occurring inland, differ materially in habit and\r\nbotanical characters from the one so conspicuous in submerged salt\r\nmarshes along the seashore; but all alike indicate strongly saline\r\nsoils, reclaimable only by thorough drainage.\r\n\r\nSALTWORT (_Suaeda torreyana_, Wats., _S. suffrutescens_, Wats., and\r\nperhaps one other species); Fig. 85.\r\n\r\nSamples of saltwort soil from Bakersfield and Byron Springs,\r\nCalifornia, taken to a depth of one foot and three feet respectively,\r\nshow that this plant grows luxuriantly in a soil containing 130,000\r\npounds of total salts per acre in the first foot, and with 10,480\r\npounds of the noxious salsoda, and 39,760 pounds of common salt in\r\nthree feet; while only a sparse growth is found on soils containing\r\nonly 3,700 pounds of salts in three feet. It thus appears to indicate\r\na lower percentage of salsoda than does Greasewood, but a higher\r\npercentage than Bushy Samphire. Further investigation is necessary\r\nto determine the exact relation of the different salts to the growth\r\nof the plant, and as to whether carbonates occur in large quantity;\r\nbut enough data have been gathered to show that a luxuriant growth of\r\nSuaeda torreyana indicates a soil reclaimable only by thorough-drainage.\r\n\r\nSuaeda torreyana occurs on low alkali lands throughout the State of\r\nCalifornia, from San Bernardino to Honey Lake, in the desert sinks,\r\nand in the Great Valley, in appropriate locations. Sometimes it is\r\nreplaced by _S. suffrutescens_ and perhaps other species, but all the\r\nsaltworts appear to grow in similar habitats, and it is probable that\r\nthe soil-conditions are practically the same for all these species.\r\nThey indicate land too heavily impregnated for the growth of ordinary\r\ncrops, but which will perhaps allow the Australian saltbush to succeed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 85.—Saltwort—_Suaeda Torreyana_, Wats.]\r\n\r\nGREASEWOOD (_Sarcobatus vermiculatus_) [Hook. Torr.]; FIG. 86.\r\n\r\nThis, the true _Greasewood_ of the desert region east of the Sierra\r\nNevada, and not either of the plants known under that name in the San\r\nJoaquin Valley and in Southern California, invariably indicates a\r\nheavy impregnation of the land with black alkali or carbonate of soda.\r\nSince, as before stated, black alkali is most likely to occur in low\r\nground, we frequently find the true greasewood forming bright green\r\npatches in the swales, and on the benches of periodic streams, as well\r\nas on the borders of alkali ponds or lakes. Stock unaccustomed to it\r\nwill frequently go to these patches on a run, only to turn away badly\r\ndisappointed after taking a few bites, the plant being both bitter and\r\nsalty.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 86.—Greasewood (proper)—_Sarcobatus vermiculatus_\r\n(Hook) Torr.]\r\n\r\n    A.

Vertical section through a fruit, showing the seed with its\r\n         curved embryo, (enlarged).\r\n\r\nWhere a luxuriant growth of this plant is found, the soil may contain\r\nfrom 38,000 to 117,000 pounds of total salts per acre, of which\r\nsometimes nearly half is carbonate of soda; the content of common salt\r\nis usually low, and Glauber’s salt or sulfate of soda, sometimes with\r\nconsiderable proportion of epsom salt, forms a variable proportion of\r\nthe total.\r\n\r\nGreasewood is distinctly a plant of the Great Basin, only reaching\r\nCalifornia in the adjacent counties of Lassen, Alpine, Mono, and\r\nnorthern Inyo. It is very abundant on the lower levels of Honey Lake\r\nvalley, Cal.\r\n\r\nThe Sarcobatus is chiefly found on silty or sandy soils of good\r\nnative fertility (see page 445, chapter 22), so that when its excess\r\nof salsoda is neutralized by means of gypsum, the land becomes very\r\nproductive. Unfortunately the cost of the amount of gypsum required\r\nto render such soils adapted to the tolerance of most culture plants\r\nis often prohibitive; but where the correction of only small spots is\r\ncalled for, the “white alkali” resulting from the gypsum treatment\r\nwould be tolerated by many culture plants.\r\n\r\nALKALI-HEATH (_Frankenia grandifolia campestris_ Gray); Fig. 87.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 87.—Alkali-Heath—_Frankenia grandifolia campestris_\r\nA. Gray.]\r\n\r\nAlkali-heath is perhaps the most widely distributed of any of the\r\nCalifornia alkali plants. Its perennial, deep-rooting habit of growth,\r\nand flexible, somewhat wiry rootstock, which enables it to persist\r\neven in cultivated ground, render it a valuable plant as an alkali\r\nindicator. The salt-content where Alkali-heath grows luxuriantly is\r\ninvariably high, ranging from 64,000 to 282,000 pounds per acre;\r\nsalsoda varies from 680 to 19,590 pounds; common salt ranges from 5,000\r\nto 10,000 pounds. Such soils would not be benefited by the application\r\nof gypsum, as the salts are already largely in the neutral state. Of\r\nuseful plants only Saltbushes and Tussock-grass are likely to flourish\r\nin such lands, when not too wet.\r\n\r\nWhile Alkali-heath is thus one of the most alkali-tolerant plants, it\r\nis at the same time capable of growth with a minimum of salts (total\r\nsalts 3,700 pounds, salsoda 680 pounds). Where only a sparse growth of\r\nthis plant occurs, therefore, the land should not be condemned until a\r\nchemical examination of the soil has been made.\r\n\r\nAlkali-heath is found on soils of very varying physical texture\r\nand degrees of moisture; while on soils of uniform texture and\r\nmoisture-conditions, but differing in chemical composition, it varies\r\nwith the varying salt-content.\r\n\r\nIt has been found that Australian saltbush (_Atriplex semibaccata_) can\r\nbe successfully grown on the “goose-lands,” of the Sacramento Valley,\r\non soil producing a medium crop of Alkali-heath; it remains to be\r\nshown whether it will do equally well on soils producing a dense and\r\nluxuriant growth of the same.\r\n\r\nAlkali-heath is widely distributed throughout the interior valleys of\r\nCalifornia; a closely related form grows in the salt-marshes of the\r\nsea-coast.\r\n\r\nCRESSA (_Cressa cretica truxillensis_ Choisy); Fig. 88.\r\n\r\nCressa soils show a low percentage of the noxious salsoda, but\r\ncomparatively heavy total salts (161,000 to 282,000 pounds per acre.)\r\nCommon salt varies from 5,760 to 20,840 pounds per acre in four feet.\r\nThe maximum is lower than in the case of Alkali-heath, but Cressa\r\nseems to be much more closely restricted to strong alkali than does\r\nthe former species. Cressa appears to be as widely distributed through\r\nthe interior valleys of California as Alkali-heath. The Cressa is a\r\ncosmopolitan plant, occurring, as its name indicates, on the Ionian\r\nIslands, as well as in North Africa, Syria, and other arid countries of\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nSALTGRASS, _Distichlis spicata_.—This grass is of world-wide\r\ndistribution, and always indicates a sensible content of soluble salts,\r\nwithout apparently any special preference for either of the three most\r\ncommonly occurring ones. Its maximum tolerance, as will be seen by\r\nthe preceding table, is very high, yet at the same time it will grow\r\nluxuriantly on lands containing so little that other saline plants\r\nlike the samphires, saltwort or greasewood will refuse to grow. On\r\nthe shores of Honey Lake, California, it may often be seen incrusted\r\nwith the salts of the water concentrated by a long season of drought,\r\nyet maintaining life, though somewhat stunted. On lands lightly\r\nimpregnated, stock will often eat it quite freely, so that it has been\r\nmistaken for Bermuda grass, to which its habit and foliage bears some\r\nresemblance. But Bermuda grass, while not as sensitive to alkali as\r\nmost forage grasses, will probably not bear much over 12,000 pounds per\r\nacre.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 88.—Cressa—_Cressa cretica truxillensis_, Choisy.]\r\n\r\nThe mere _presence_ of the salt grass cannot therefore be taken as a\r\ndefinite indication of anything more than that there is an unusual\r\namount of salts in the soil; whether or not there is more than will be\r\ntolerated by the ordinary culture-plants, must be judged either from\r\nthe accompanying plants, or by experiment or analysis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 89.—Salt-Grass—_Distichlis spicata_ (L.) Greede.]\r\n\r\n_Relative Tolerance of the Different Species._—The following table\r\nshows in systematic order the tolerance of the several plants discussed\r\nabove, for the different salts, so far as the data available permit.\r\nThe column marked _optimum_ shows under what proportions of salts the\r\nplants grew in about equal luxuriance, therefore under, apparently,\r\nthe most favorable conditions. Both above and below the proportions\r\nmentioned in that column, the luxuriance (size) and (usually) the\r\nabundance of the plants was less; showing that while excessive amounts\r\nof salts depressed their welfare, yet they also suffered when the\r\nproportions dropped below a certain point. Whether this was partly or\r\nwholly the result of competition with other plants, is an unsettled\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n      TABLE SHOWING MAXIMUM, OPTIMUM, AND MINIMUM OF SALTS\r\n         TOLERATED BY EACH OF THE SEVERAL ALKALI PLANTS.\r\n    -------------------------------+-----------------------------\r\n                                   |  Pounds Per Acre in feet.\r\n                                   +-----------+--------+--------\r\n                                   |  Optimum. |Maximum.|Minimum.\r\n    -------------------------------+-----------+--------+--------\r\n            _Total Salts._         |           |        |\r\n    Bushy Samphire                 |   494,320 | 494,520| 135,060\r\n    Dwarf Samphires                |   441,880 | 441,880| 441,880\r\n    Alkali-heath                   |{  281,960}| 499,040|   3,720\r\n                                   |{   64,300}|        |\r\n    Cressa                         |   281,960 | 281,960| 161,160\r\n    Saltworts                      |   130,000 | 153,020|   3,720\r\n    Greasewood                     |    58,560 |  58,560|   2,400\r\n    Tussock-grass                  |    49,000 | 499,040|  49,000\r\n                                   |           |        |\r\n        _Carbonate_ (Salsoda).     |           |        |\r\n    Tussock-grass                  |    23,000 |  44,460|   3,040\r\n    Alkali-heath              [202]| {  19,590}|  19,590|     680\r\n                                   | {     680}|        |\r\n    Greasewood                     |    18,720 |  18,720|   1,280\r\n    Dwarf Samphires                |    12,120 |  12,120|   2,200\r\n    Saltworts                      |    10,480 |  12,120|   1,120\r\n    Cressa                         |     5,440 |   5,440|     680\r\n    Bushy Samphire                 |     4,800 |   4,800|   1,500\r\n                                   |           |        |\r\n       _Chloride_ (Common Salt).   |           |        |\r\n    Bushy Samphire                 |   212,080 | 275,160|  56,800\r\n    Dwarf Samphires                |   125,640 | 125,640| 125,640\r\n    Saltworts                      |    39,760 |  52,900|   1,040\r\n    Cressa                         |    20,840 |  20,840|   5,760\r\n    Alkali-heath                   |{   10,180}| 212,080|   1,040\r\n                                   |{    5,760}|        |\r\n    Tussock-grass                  |     6,200 | 172,800|   3,530\r\n    Greasewood                     |     3,680 |   3,680|     160\r\n                                   |           |        |\r\n     _Sulphates_ (Glauber’s salt). |           |        |\r\n    Dwarf Samphires                |   314,040 | 314,040| 314,040\r\n    Bushy Samphire                 |   277,640 | 277,640|  50,080\r\n    Cressa                         |   275,520 | 275,520| 134,880\r\n    Alkali-heath                   |{  275,520}| 323,200|   1,560\r\n                                   |{   34,530}|        |\r\n    Saltworts                      |    44,160 | 104,040|   1,560\r\n    Greasewood                     |    36,160 |  36,160|     960\r\n    Tussock Grass                  |    19,640 | 323,200|  19,640\r\n    -------------------------------+-----------+--------+--------\r\n\r\n[202] This plant grows with equal luxuriance in soils containing only\r\n680 pounds of carbonates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDICES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX A.\r\n\r\nDIRECTIONS FOR TAKING SOIL SAMPLES. ISSUED BY THE CALIFORNIA EXPERIMENT\r\nSTATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn taking soil specimens for examination by the Agricultural Experiment\r\nStation, the following directions should be carefully observed; always\r\nbearing in mind that the examination, and especially the analysis, of\r\na soil is a long and tedious operation, which cannot be indefinitely\r\nrepeated.\r\n\r\n_First._—Do not take samples at random from any points on the land, but\r\nconsider what are the two or three chief varieties of soil which, _with\r\ntheir intermixtures_, make up the cultivable area, and carefully sample\r\nthese, each separately; then, if necessary, sample your particular\r\nsoil, noting its relation to these typical ones.\r\n\r\n_Second._—As a rule, and whenever possible, take specimens from spots\r\nthat have not been cultivated, nor are otherwise likely to have been\r\nchanged from their original condition of “virgin soils”—_e.g._, not\r\nfrom ground frequently trodden over, such as roadsides, cattle-paths,\r\nor small pastures, squirrel holes, stumps, or even the foot of trees,\r\nor spots that have been washed by rains or streams, so as to have\r\nexperienced a notable change, and not be a fair representative of their\r\nkind.\r\n\r\n_Third._—Observe and record carefully the normal vegetation, trees,\r\nherbs, grass, etc., of the average virgin land; avoid spots showing\r\nunusual growth, whether in kind or in quality, as such are likely to\r\nhave received some animal manure, or other outside addition.\r\n\r\n_Fourth._—Always take specimens from more than one spot judged to\r\nbe a fair representative of the soil intended to be examined, as an\r\nadditional guarantee of a fair average, and mix thoroughly the earth\r\n_taken from the same depths_.\r\n\r\n_Fifth._—After selecting a proper spot, pull up the plants growing\r\non it, and sweep off the surface with a broom or brush to remove\r\nhalf-decayed vegetable matter not forming part of the soil as yet. Dig\r\nor bore a vertical hole, like a post-hole, and note at what depth a\r\nchange of tint occurs. In the humid region, or in humid lowlands of\r\nthe arid, this will usually happen at from six to nine inches from the\r\nsurface, and a sample taken _to_ that depth will constitute the “soil.”\r\n\r\nIn California and the arid region generally, very commonly no change\r\nof tint occurs within the first foot, sometimes not for several feet;\r\nhence, especially in sandy lands, the “soil” sample will usually be\r\ntaken to that depth, so as to represent the _average of the first foot_\r\nfrom the surface down.\r\n\r\n_Samples taken merely from the surface, or from the bottom of a hole,\r\nhave no definite meaning, and will not be examined or reported upon._\r\n\r\nPlace the “soil” sample upon a cloth (jute bagging should not be used\r\nfor the purpose, as its fibres, dust, etc., become intermixed with the\r\nsoil) or paper, break it up, mix thoroughly, and put _at least a quart_\r\nof it in a sack or package properly labeled, for examination.\r\n\r\nThis specimen will, ordinarily, constitute the “soil.” Should the\r\nchange of color occur at a less depth than six inches, the fact should\r\nbe noted, but the specimen taken to that depth nevertheless, since it\r\nis the least to which rational culture can be supposed to reach.\r\n\r\nIn the same way take a sample of each foot separately to a depth of at\r\nleast three feet; preferably four or five, especially in the case of\r\nalkali soils, or suspected hardpan.\r\n\r\n_Sixth._—Whatever lies beneath the line of change, or below the minimum\r\ndepth of six inches, will constitute the “subsoil.” But should the\r\nchange of color occur at a greater depth than twelve inches, the “soil”\r\nspecimen should nevertheless be taken to the depth of twelve inches\r\nonly, which is the limit of ordinary tillage; then another specimen\r\nfrom that depth down to the line of change, and then the “subsoil”\r\nspecimens beneath that line.\r\n\r\nThe depth down to which the last should be taken will depend on\r\ncircumstances. It is always necessary to know what constitutes the\r\nfoundation of a soil, down to the depth of three feet _at least_, since\r\nthe question of drainage, resistance to drought, root-penetration,\r\netc., will depend essentially upon the nature of the substratum. In\r\nthe arid region, where roots frequently penetrate to depths of ten\r\nor twelve feet or even more, it is frequently necessary to at least\r\n_probe_ the land to that depth or deeper. The specimens should be taken\r\nin other respects precisely like that of the surface soil, _each to\r\nrepresent the average of not more than twelve inches_. Those of the\r\nmaterials lying below the third foot from the surface may sometimes be\r\ntaken at some ditch or other easily accessible point, and if possible\r\nshould not be broken up like the other specimens.\r\n\r\nIf there is _hardpan or heavy clay_ present, an unbroken lump of it\r\nshould be sent, for much depends on its character.\r\n\r\n_Seventh._—When in the case of cultivated lands, it is desired to\r\nascertain the cause of differences in the behavior or success of a\r\ncrop on different portions of the same field or soil area, do not send\r\nonly the soil which bears unsatisfactory growth, but also the one\r\nbearing normal, good growth, for comparison. In all such cases, try to\r\nascertain by your own observations whether or not the fault is simply\r\nin the subsoil or substrata; in which case a sample of surface soil\r\nsent for examination would be of little use. In such examinations the\r\nsoil probe will be of great service, and save much digging or boring.\r\n\r\n_Eighth._—Specimens of alkali or salty soils should preferably be taken\r\ntowards the end of the dry season, when the surface layers will contain\r\nthe largest amount of salts. A special sample of the first six inches\r\nshould in that case be taken separately by means of a post-hole auger,\r\nand then, in a different spot close by, a hole four feet deep should\r\nbe bored, and _the earth from the entire four-foot column_ intimately\r\nmixed before the usual quart sample is taken. Samples of the plants\r\ngrowing on the land should in all cases be included in the package, as\r\nthey indicate very closely the agricultural character of the land.\r\n\r\n_All samples taken while the land is wet should be air-dried before\r\nsending; in the case of alkali soils this is absolutely essential._\r\n\r\n_Ninth._—All peculiarities of the soil and subsoil, their behavior\r\nunder tillage and cultivation in various crops, in wet and dry seasons,\r\ntheir location, position, “lay,” every circumstance, in fact, that\r\ncan throw any light on their agricultural qualities or peculiarities,\r\nshould be carefully noted, and _the notes sent by mail_. _Without\r\nsuch notes, specimens cannot ordinarily be considered as justifying\r\nthe amount of labor involved in their examination._ Any fault found\r\nwith the behavior of the land in cultivation or crop-bearing should\r\nbe specially mentioned and described. The conditions governing\r\ncrop-production are so complex that even with the fullest information\r\nand the most careful work, cases are found in which as yet the best\r\nexperts will be at fault.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX B.\r\n\r\nSUMMARY DIRECTIONS FOR SOIL—EXAMINATION IN THE FIELD OR ON THE FARM.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the general principles upon which the cultural value and\r\nadaptations of lands should be judged, have been given in the text\r\nof this volume, it seems advisable to summarize their practical\r\napplication to land examination here, for convenient reference.\r\n\r\nThe directions given in Appendix A for the sampling of soils having\r\nbeen carried out, the samples so taken may be subjected to farther\r\nexamination by any intelligent farmer to good purpose, and often with\r\ngreat saving of time and expense.\r\n\r\nSpread the samples from the several depths in regular order upon a\r\ntable or bench, and note the differences in color and texture apparent\r\nto the eye or touch, and whether they will or will not crush readily\r\nbetween the fingers, wet and dry. Whatever the fingers can do, can\r\nsimilarly be done by the harrow, cultivator, clod crusher or roller.\r\n\r\nThe tilling qualities of the surface soil and immediate subsoil are the\r\nfirst and most important matter to be ascertained; including especially\r\ntheir behavior to water. Place some air-dried lumps in a shallow dish\r\nwith a little water; observe whether they take up the water quickly\r\nor slowly, and whether in so doing the lumps fall to pieces or retain\r\ntheir form. Slow penetration, and maintenance of form, will at once\r\nindicate a soil somewhat refractory and difficult to till; while if\r\nthe water is taken up easily and the lump falls to pieces, the land\r\nis easily cultivated and will absorb the rainfall and irrigation\r\nwater readily. The darkening of the tint on wetting will also give an\r\napproximate idea of its humus-content.\r\n\r\nThen take a wetted lump and work it between the fingers and on the palm\r\nof the hand, until its “stickiness” or adhesiveness ceases to increase.\r\nThis “hand test” is of first importance and in skillful hands will\r\nlargely supersede the need of elaborate mechanical analysis. It will\r\nat once enable the operator to classify the soil as a light or heavy\r\nloam, clay loam or clay soil; it will show directly what will be the\r\nresult of plowing the land when wet, the liability to the formation of\r\na plowsole, and whether a single or a double team will generally be\r\nneeded to cultivate it properly. Also whether stock can be allowed to\r\npasture the land soon after rain. Comparison with the known land of\r\nneighbors will also thus become easy, and in a measure the crops best\r\nadapted to the physical qualities of the soil, subsoil and substrata,\r\ntaking into account their respective depths, will at once be at least\r\napproximately determined. The presence of coarse and fine sand in\r\ngreater or less amounts will also be thus readily ascertained, allowing\r\nestimates of the percolative properties; the latter can, of course,\r\nbe more practically tested in the field, in the manner described in\r\nchapter 13, page 242.\r\n\r\nA more definite estimate of the amount and kind of sand present in the\r\nsoil materials can be obtained by washing the _kneaded_ sample into\r\na tumbler, and allowing a thin stream of water to flow into it from\r\na faucet while gently stirring the turbid water. The clay, together\r\nwith the finest silts, will thus be carried off over the rim of the\r\nglass, and sand of any desired degree of fineness, according to the\r\nstrength of the stream of water used, will be left behind. The kind and\r\namount of these sandy materials can then be estimated, or definitely\r\nascertained by weighing or measuring.\r\n\r\nThis will, generally speaking, be as far as the uninstructed farmer\r\ncan readily go; but these simple operations will give him an insight\r\ninto the nature of his soil and subsoil that will enable him to avoid a\r\ngreat many costly mistakes.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECOGNITION AND MEANING OF THE SEVERAL SOIL MINERALS.[203]\r\n\r\nThose somewhat familiar with scientific methods and operations, and\r\nsupplied with pocket lens or microscope, can profitably go much\r\nfarther towards the definite ascertainment of the permanent cultural\r\nvalue of the land, by the study of the minerals of which the sand is\r\ncomposed, and which as a rule represent those from which the entire\r\nsoil has been formed; therefore indicate in a general manner its\r\nchemical composition. Such examinations are specially feasible and\r\nimportant when soils are not far removed from their parent rocks, as\r\nin most of the arid region, and in the states north of the Ohio. In\r\nthe Southwestern states, in the coastal plain of the Gulf of Mexico,\r\nthe original soil minerals have usually been too far decomposed to\r\nadmit of definite identification. Sand is there as a rule made up of\r\nquartz grains of many varieties, with only an occasional tourmaline and\r\npyroxene.\r\n\r\n[203] For more details see chapters 3 and 4.\r\n\r\nAmong the prominent soil minerals, quartz is almost always recognizable\r\nby its glassy luster and the irregular fracture—absence of definite\r\nplanes or facets of cleavage, causing the grains to be abraded or\r\nrounded nearly alike in all directions. The _feldspars_, on the\r\ncontrary, always show a tendency to cleave into fragments having\r\ndefinite, obviously oblique angles, which are perceptible even when\r\nthe grains are somewhat worn; because of the difference in the ease\r\nwith which wear takes place in the several directions. _Potash\r\nfeldspar_, moreover, which is the most important to be recognized\r\nbecause it indicates a relatively large supply of potash in the\r\nnatural soil, is but rarely glassy in luster, but mostly dull white,\r\nor reddish-white.—The _lime_ and _lime-soda_ feldspars rarely show as\r\ndefinite forms, because of their tendency to form complex crystalline\r\naggregates (twins): and their definite recognition requires somewhat\r\ncomplex (polarizing) appliances in connection with the microscope. In\r\nsuch cases, however, the accompanying minerals (hornblende, pyroxene,\r\nmica and others) often afford valuable indications, because of their\r\nknown association with soda-lime feldspars in certain rocks.\r\n\r\nAn abundant occurrence of _hornblende_ fragments, characterized by\r\ntheir flat, tabular form, and bottle-green or black tint, indicate,\r\nalmost always a fairly good supply of lime in the soil, but leaves\r\nthe potash-supply in doubt. _Pyroxene_ (distinguished by its smooth,\r\npolished surface from the angularly-weathering, usually rusty\r\nhornblende fragments) rarely occurs with potash feldspar; and soils\r\nstrongly charged with it are mostly poor in potash.\r\n\r\n_Mica_ occurs in so many rocks and is of so little consequence as\r\na soil-ingredient from the chemical point of view, because of its\r\ndifficult decomposition, that its presence can mostly only serve to\r\ncorroborate or contradict conclusions as to the derivation of a soil\r\nfrom some particular rock or region. But mica serves a good purpose in\r\nimproving the tilling qualities of soils. Its thin scales must not be\r\nmistaken for the tabular fragments of hornblende.\r\n\r\n_Calcite_ in its several forms is mostly easily recognized both by\r\nits form under the microscope, and by the effervescence its granules\r\nshow when touched with an acid. This effervescence can generally be\r\nobserved on touching the wetted soil with chlorhydric acid, so soon as\r\nthe content exceeds two per cent; but something depends upon the size\r\nof the grains, as when these are very small, the giving-off of gas is\r\nless readily noted. To facilitate it, the wetted soil may be warmed\r\nbefore touching it with the acid. The recognition of the presence of\r\nlime carbonate in soils is so important as to justify considerable\r\ntrouble in rendering it definite. When the aid of a chemist cannot be\r\ncommanded, fairly definite conclusions may be drawn from the character\r\nof the native vegetation; regarding which, detailed information may\r\nbe found in Parts III and IV of this volume. But where, as in the\r\narid region, this criterion is not available, since the controlling\r\nfactor there is the moisture supply, a presumption may be gained by the\r\napplication of a slip of moistened red litmus paper to the _wetted_\r\nsoil. Should the red paper be turned blue within one or two minutes\r\nit would indicate the presence of carbonate of soda (“black alkali”)\r\nas well as of lime carbonates: but if blued only after twenty minutes\r\nor more, it would indicate the presence of the carbonates of lime and\r\nmagnesia. If not changed at all, the conclusion would be that either\r\nlime carbonate is in very small supply, or that the soil is in an acid\r\ncondition. (See chapter 8, p. 122).\r\n\r\n_Saline and Alkali Soils._—The presence of an unusual or injurious\r\namount of _soluble salts_, as in the case of sea-coast and alkali\r\nsoils, is commonly easily ascertained in the field; where, if the\r\nsurface soil is at all seriously contaminated with soluble salts of any\r\nkind, these may be seen on the surface during a dry season, forming a\r\nwhitish efflorescence, which in most cases is definitely crystalline.\r\nIn doubtful cases a tablespoonful of the surface soil may be leached\r\nwith water, and the first ten or fifteen drops caught in a clean,\r\nbright silver spoon and evaporated. Or the soil may be stirred up with\r\nabout twice its bulk of water and the mixture be allowed to clear by\r\nsettling, then evaporating. A slight whitish film will almost always\r\nremain in the spoon; but if the amount be somewhat considerable, the\r\npresence of soluble salts is very readily recognized by pouring a\r\nfew drops of clear water on one side of the spot, and then allowing\r\nit to flow gently over the spot to another place, where it is again\r\nslowly evaporated. Any considerable amount of salts present will be\r\nshown both in the diminution of the original spot, and in the soluble\r\nresidue accumulated where the water was last evaporated. Should _common\r\nsalt_ be present to any considerable extent, the residue in the silver\r\nspoon will, if the last drops be allowed to evaporate slowly, show\r\nsquare or cubical crystals to the naked eye, and certainly to a common\r\npocket lens. The residue may also be tested with red litmus paper for\r\ncarbonate of soda, which would quickly turn it blue.\r\n\r\nMore detailed examination requires chemical reagents and experience,\r\nbut the above tests should be sufficient to prevent the mistaking of\r\nmere white spots, whose humus has been destroyed by fermentation caused\r\nby bad drainage, with true alkali caused by excess of soluble salts; a\r\nmistake not uncommon in both the arid and humid regions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX C.\r\n\r\nSHORT APPROXIMATE METHODS OF SOIL EXAMINATION USED AT THE CALIFORNIA\r\nEXPERIMENT STATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY R. H. LOUGHRIDGE.\r\n\r\nThe California Experiment Station has for many years given the farmers\r\nof the State the privilege of having their soils examined to ascertain\r\nany physical defects, deficiency in plant-food, or the presence of\r\nalkali salts. They have quite generally taken advantage of this, and\r\nthe number of samples of soil sent in each year has been very large.\r\n\r\nA complete analysis of a soil-sample requires fully 15 days; hence the\r\nnecessity of adopting some quick methods for the determination of the\r\nmain elements of fertility, viz., humus, lime, potash, and phosphoric\r\nacid, that would at the same time give results sufficiently accurate\r\nfor practical purposes. Similarly for alkali salts in the soil; the\r\nleaching-out and analysis of which often occupies more than a week.\r\n\r\nThe following methods have been adopted, which shorten the time of\r\nexamination for the plant-food of a soil to about one hour, except for\r\npotash, which requires a much longer time. For alkali salts the time is\r\nreduced to two days, and less if a pressure filter be used.\r\n\r\n_Humus._—The Grandeau method of ammonia extraction requires the removal\r\nof the lime and magnesia with weak hydrochloric acid, washing out of\r\nthe acid and then digestion with weak ammonia; all of which, with a\r\nsoil rich in humus, may require many days, though a number of samples\r\nmay be put through at the same time.\r\n\r\nThe method adopted to determine adequacy or inadequacy of the humus\r\n(for this is all that is intended in this examination) is completed in\r\nless than half an hour. It is based on the color of the humus-extract\r\nand avoids the necessity of removal of the lime from the soil.\r\n\r\nThe soil is pulverized in a mortar with a rubber pestle, and passed\r\nthrough a half-millimeter sieve. Seven grams of the fine earth is\r\nplaced in a test tube with 15 or 20 cc. of a ten per cent solution of\r\ncaustic potash and boiled for ten or fifteen seconds, then allowed to\r\nsettle. The humus is dissolved and the density of the color of the\r\nsolution is an indication of adequacy or inadequacy. A dense black,\r\nnon-translucent solution shows the presence of at least one per cent\r\nof humus in the soil; a deep brown translucent color indicates about\r\none-half of one per cent; while a light brown color clearly shows a\r\ndeficiency in the soil, and a need of a good green-manure crop.\r\n\r\n_Lime._—Two grams of fine earth is treated with a little hydrochloric\r\nacid, boiled for a few seconds, and ammonia is added to precipitate\r\nthe iron and alumina; the whole, with the soil-residue, is quickly\r\nthrown on a filter to separate the mass from the lime solution, and\r\nwashed. After adding ammonium chlorid the lime is precipitated with\r\noxalate of ammonia, and its adequacy for soil-fertility judged of by\r\nthe turbidity of the solution, or the bulk of the precipitate. Or the\r\nlatter may be filtered off, dried and weighed. We thus obtain a measure\r\nof the carbonate and humate of lime present, by comparing it with the\r\nprecipitate obtained from a soil whose percentage of lime has been\r\ncorrectly ascertained.\r\n\r\n_Potash._—The determination of potash in the soils requires more time\r\nthan either of the other ingredients, and is more rarely made by us.\r\nOur knowledge of the soils of the State of California obtained through\r\nmany analyses, gives us a clue to those localities where potash would\r\nprobably be deficient, as well as to those whose soils are generally\r\nextremely rich in potash; the percentages reaching usually from .5 to\r\nas much as 1.5 per cent and more.\r\n\r\nFor the determination, two grams of the fine earth is digested in\r\nhydrochloric acid over a steam bath for two days, the insoluble residue\r\nfiltered off, the filtrate evaporated to dryness to render the silica\r\ninsoluble, again filtered and the iron; alumina and lime removed by\r\nprecipitation with ammonia and oxalate of ammonia and filtration. The\r\nfiltrate is then evaporated to dryness, the ammonia salts destroyed\r\nwith _aqua regia_ or driven off by heat, and the alkalies changed to\r\nchlorids. Any residue is then filtered off and platin-chlorid added to\r\nprecipitate the potash, which is separated and determined in the usual\r\nway, either by reduction of the platinum by ignition, or by measurement\r\nin a Plattner’s potash tube.\r\n\r\n_Phosphoric Acid._—The determination of phosphoric acid is based on\r\nthe volume of the phospho-molybdate precipitate in a tube made like a\r\nPlattner’s potash tube, but having a wider interior diameter for the\r\nsmaller portion (not greater than 3 millimeters), and a length of 50\r\nmm. With this diameter, one mm. in height of the precipitate obtained\r\nby our short method indicates one one-hundredth of one per cent of\r\nphosphoric acid in the soil. The unit of measure must be obtained\r\nfor each tube, unless of uniform diameter, and is ascertained by\r\ntaking a soil whose phosphoric-acid percentage has been determined\r\ngravimetrically and giving it the following quick treatment; which\r\nmust, of course, be closely followed in each soil to be examined.\r\n\r\nTwo grams of the fine earth is ignited in a platinum dish to destroy\r\nthe organic matter, transferred to a test-tube containing 5 cc. of\r\nnitric acid and made to boil for only a couple of seconds, thus\r\npreventing the solution of silicates to any material extent. It is not\r\nallowed to stand, but a little water is immediately added and it is\r\nquickly thrown on a small filter and washed with a little water. The\r\nphosphoric acid is then precipitated with molybdic acid at the proper\r\ntemperature; allowing it to settle, the liquid is drawn off and the\r\nprecipitate transferred to the measuring-tube. It settles into the\r\nsmall part in a short time if the latter is not too narrow, and is then\r\nmeasured with a millimeter scale. This represents the percentage as\r\nfound in the soil by the gravimetric method, and serves as a guide for\r\nother examinations, whose agreement with gravimetric determinations is\r\ngenerally quite close, and quite sufficient for practical purposes.\r\nThe rapidity with which the solution is made and separated from the\r\nsoil is a matter of special importance for comparative results, or\r\ndetermination of percentages; for if the acid solution be allowed to\r\nstand for some time before filtration from the soil, silica passes into\r\nsolution also, and the volume of the molybdate precipitate is increased\r\nby it; thus vitiating the results and adding to the time required for\r\nthe method. By this short method the practically important phosphoric\r\nacid in the soil may be approximately determined within half an hour.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHORT METHOD FOR ALKALI SALTS.\r\n\r\nThe old method of obtaining solutions of the salts by leaching the\r\nsoil on a filter until all of the alkali had been washed out has been\r\nreplaced by the following short one. 50 or 100 grams of the well-mixed\r\nsoil is placed in a bottle containing 200 cc. of water, shaken up\r\noccasionally during 12 hours and allowed to settle. The solution may\r\nthen be passed through a common filter (or preferably a pressure\r\nfilter) and an aliquot part (usually 50 cc.) of the filtrate evaporated\r\nto dryness in a platinum basin and ignited at a temperature just below\r\nredness to destroy any organic matter that may be present. The basin\r\nand contents are weighed and the soluble salts are dissolved in a very\r\nlittle water and separated by filtration through a small filter into a\r\n50 cc. cylinder and the alkali carbonates and chlorids determined by\r\ntitration, being calculated as sodium compounds.\r\n\r\nThe material remaining on the filter and in the basin, consisting of\r\ninsoluble earth, carbonates and calcium sulfate, is gently ignited\r\nin the basin and weighed; the difference between this and the first\r\nweight gives approximately the _total soluble salts_, which should\r\nsubstantially correspond to the titrations made.\r\n\r\nThe sulfates are determined by differences between these and the total\r\nalkalies. The solution may contain some sulfate of magnesia, or calcium\r\nand magnesium chlorids, and these are determined gravimetrically.\r\n\r\nNitrates, which may have been destroyed in the first ignition, are\r\ndetermined in the original solution by the picric method. Any magnesia\r\nrendered insoluble by the ignition may usually be accounted for as\r\nchlorid, unless much nitrate is present which is rarely the case in\r\ncarbonated alkali. If much nitric acid was found, it should be first\r\nassigned to magnesia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    A.\r\n                                                PAGE\r\n    Absorption and movements of water in soils, 221\r\n      of solids from solutions, 267\r\n      of gases by soils, 272, 275\r\n    Acacias, tolerance of alkali, 480\r\n    Accessory minerals, 50\r\n    Acid, strength used in soil analysis, 341\r\n    Acidic and basic eruptive and metamorphic rocks, 49\r\n    Acidity, neutrality, alkalinity of soils, 322\r\n    Acids of different strengths, analysis with;
