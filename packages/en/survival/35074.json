CLODE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nSHARP WORK\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Prisoner, attention! His excellency the President has permitted Senor\r\nSteinbaum to visit you.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"prisoner\" was lying on his back on a plank bed, with his hands\r\ntucked beneath his head to obtain some measure of protection from the\r\nroll of rough fiber matting which formed a pillow. He did not pay the\r\nslightest heed to the half-caste Spanish jailer's gruff command. But the\r\nvisitor's name stirred him. He turned his head, apparently to make sure\r\nthat he was not being deceived, and rose on an elbow.\r\n\r\n\"Hello, Steinbaum!\" he said in English. \"What's the swindle? Excuse this\r\nterseness, but I have to die in an hour, or even less, if a sunbeam\r\nhasn't misled me.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's no swindle this time, Mr. Maseden,\" came the guttural answer.\r\n\"I'm sorry I cannot help you, but I want you to do a good turn for a\r\nlady.\"\r\n\r\n\"A lady! What lady?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know.\"\r\n\r\n\"If _you_ don't know the lady that is a recommendation in itself. At any\r\nrate, what sort of good turn can a man condemned to death do for any\r\nlady?\"\r\n\r\n\"She wants to marry you.\"\r\n\r\nThen the man who, by his own showing, was rapidly nearing the close of\r\nhis earthly career, sprang erect and looked so threatening that his\r\nvisitor shrank back a pace, while the half-caste jailer's right hand\r\nclutched the butt of a revolver.\r\n\r\n\"Whatever else I may have thought you, I never regarded you as a\r\nfool, Steinbaum,\" he said sternly. \"Go away, man! Have you no sense\r\nof decency? You and that skunk Enrico Suarez, have done your worst\r\nagainst me and succeeded. When I am dead the 'state' will collar my\r\nproperty--and I am well aware that in this instance the 'state' will\r\nbe represented by Senor Enrico Suarez and Mr. Fritz Steinbaum. You are\r\nabout to murder and rob me. Can't you leave me in peace during the last\r\nfew minutes of my life? Be off, or you may find that in coming here you\r\nhave acted foolishly for once.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Ach, was!_\" sighed Steinbaum, nevertheless retreating another step\r\ntowards the door and the watchful half-caste, who had been warned to\r\nshoot straight and quickly if the prisoner attacked the august person of\r\nthe portly financier. \"I tell you the truth, and you will not listen. It\r\nis as I say. A lady, a stranger, arrived in Cartagena last night. She\r\nheard of you this morning. She asked: 'Is he married, this American?'\r\nThey said, 'No.' Then she came to me and begged me to use my influence\r\nwith the President. She said: 'If this American gentleman is to be shot,\r\nI am sorry; but it cannot matter to him if he is married, and it will\r\noblige me very much.' I told her--\"\r\n\r\nThe speaker's voice grew husky and he paused to clear his throat.\r\nMaseden smiled wanly at the mad absurdity of it, but he was beginning to\r\nbelieve some part of Steinbaum's story.\r\n\r\n\"And what did you tell her?\" he broke in.\r\n\r\n\"I told her that you were Quixotic in some things, and you might agree.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what on earth does the lady gain by it? Suarez and you will take\r\nmighty good care she doesn't get away with my ranch and money. Does she\r\nwant my name?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps.\"\r\n\r\nMaseden took thought a moment.\r\n\r\n\"It has never been dishonored during my life,\" he said quietly. \"I would\r\nneed to be assured that it will not be smirched after my death.\"\r\n\r\nSteinbaum was stout. A certain anxiety to succeed in an extraordinary\r\nmission, joined to the warm, moist atmosphere of the cell, had induced a\r\ncopious perspiration.\r\n\r\n\"_Ach, Gott!_\" he purred despairingly. \"I know nothing. She told me\r\nnothing. She offered to pay me for the trouble--\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not? I run some risk in acting so. She is American, like yourself.\r\nShe came to me--\"\r\n\r\n\"American, you say! Is she young?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think so. I have not seen her face. She wears a thick veil.\"\r\n\r\nRomance suddenly spread its fairy wings in that squalid South American\r\nprison-house. Maseden's spirit was fired to perform a last act of\r\nchivalry, of mercy, it might be, in behalf of some unhappy girl of his\r\nown race. The sheer folly of this amazing marriage moved him to grim\r\nmirth.\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" he said with a half-hearted laugh. \"I'll do it! But, as\r\n_you_ are mixing the cards, Steinbaum, there must be a joker in the pack\r\nsomewhere. I'm a pretty quick thinker, you know, and I shall probably\r\nsee through your proposition before I die, though I am damned if I can\r\nsize it up right off.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Maseden, I assure you, on my--well, you and I never were friends\r\nand never will be, but I have told you the real facts this time.\"\r\n\r\n\"When is the wedding to take place?\"\r\n\r\n\"Now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Great Scott! Did the lady come with you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. She is here with a priest and a notary.\"\r\n\r\nMaseden peered over the jailer's shoulder into the whitewashed passage\r\nbeyond the half-open door, as though he expected to find a shrouded\r\nfigure standing there. Steinbaum interpreted his glance.\r\n\r\n\"She is in the great hall,\" he said. \"The guard is waiting at the end of\r\nthe corridor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it's to be a military wedding, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, in a sense.\"\r\n\r\nThe younger man appreciated the nice distinction Steinbaum was drawing.\r\nThe waiting \"guard\" was the firing-party.\r\n\r\n\"What time is it?\" he demanded, so sharply that the fat man started. For\r\na skilled intriguer Steinbaum was ridiculously nervous.\r\n\r\n\"A quarter past seven.\"\r\n\r\n\"Allow me to put the question as delicately as possible, but--er--is\r\nthere any extension of time beyond eight o'clock?\"\r\n\r\n\"Senor Suarez would not give one minute.\"\r\n\r\n\"He knows about the ceremony, of course?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"What a skunk the man is! How he must fear me! Such Spartan\r\ninflexibility is foreign to the Spanish nature.... By the way,\r\nSteinbaum, did you ever, in your innocent youth, hear the opera\r\n'Maritana,' or see a play called 'Don Cesar de Bazan'?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why waste time, Mr. Maseden?\" cried the other impatiently. He loathed\r\nthe environment of that dim cell, with its slightly foetid air,\r\nsuggestive of yellow jack and dysentery. He was so obviously ill at\r\nease, so fearful lest he should fail in an extraordinary negotiation,\r\nthat, given less strenuous conditions, the younger man must have read\r\nmore into the proposal than appeared on the face of it.\r\n\r\nBut the sands of life were running short for Maseden. Outwardly cool and\r\nimperturbably American, his soul was in revolt. For all that he laughed\r\ncheerfully.\r\n\r\n\"Waste time, indeed!\" he cried. \"I, who have less than forty-five\r\nminutes to live!... Now, these are my terms.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are no terms,\" broke in Steinbaum harshly. \"You oblige the lady,\r\nor you don't. Please yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, that's better. That sounds more like the hound that I know you are.\r\nYet, I insist on my terms.\r\n\r\n\"I was dragged out of bed in my pajamas at four o'clock this morning,\r\nand not even permitted to dress. They hardly waited to get me a pair of\r\nboots. I haven't a red cent in my pocket, which is a figure of speech,\r\nbecause I haven't a pocket. If you think you can borrow from an old\r\ncomedy just so much of the situation as suits your purpose and disregard\r\nthe costume and appearance of the star actor, you're mistaken.\r\n\r\n\"I gather from your furious grunts that you don't understand me. Very\r\nwell. I'll come straight to the point. If I am to marry the lady of your\r\nchoice, I demand the right to appear at the altar decently clad and with\r\nenough good money in my pocket to stand a few bottles of wine to the\r\ngallant blackguards who are about to shoot me.\r\n\r\n\"Those are my terms, Steinbaum. Take them or leave them! But don't\r\naccuse _me_ of wasting time. It's up to you to arrange the stage\r\nsetting. I might have insisted on a shave, but I won't.\r\n\r\n\"The lady will not expect me to kiss her, I suppose?... By gad, she must\r\nbe a person of strange tastes. Why any young woman should want to marry\r\na man because he's going to be shot half an hour later is one of those\r\nmysteries which the feminine mind may comprehend, but it's beyond me.\r\nHowever, that's her affair, not mine.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Steinbaum, hurry up! _I'm_ talking for the mere sake of hearing my\r\nown voice, but _you're_ keeping the lady in suspense.\"\r\n\r\nMaseden had indeed correctly described his own attitude. He was wholly\r\nindifferent to the personal element in the bizarre compact proposed by\r\nhis arch-enemy, on whom he had turned his back while speaking.\r\n\r\nThe sight of a bloated, angry, perplexed face of the coarsest type was\r\nmentally disturbing. He elected rather to watch the shaft of sunlight\r\ncoming through the long, narrow slit in a four-foot wall which served as\r\na window. He knew that his cell was on the northeast side of the prison,\r\nand the traveling sunbeam had already marked the flight of time with\r\nsufficient accuracy since he was thrust into that dismal place.\r\n\r\nHe had been sentenced to death just one hour and a half after being\r\narrested. The evidence, like the trial, was a travesty of justice. His\r\nexcellency Don Enrico Suarez, elected president of the Republic of San\r\nJuan at midnight, and confirmed in power by the bullet which removed his\r\npredecessor, wreaked vengeance speedily on the American intruder who had\r\nhelped to mar his schemes twice in two years.\r\n\r\nThere would be a diplomatic squabble about the judicial murder of a\r\ncitizen of the United States, of course. The American and British\r\nconsuls would protest, and both countries would dispatch warships to\r\nCartagena, which was at once the capital of the republic and its chief\r\nport. But of what avail such wrangling after one was dead?\r\n\r\nDead, at twenty-eight, when the world was bright and fortune was\r\napparently smiling! Dead, because he supported dear old Domenico\r\nValdes, the murdered president, and one of the few honest, God-fearing\r\nmen in a rotten little South American state which would have been swept\r\nout of putrid existence long ago were it not for the policy of the\r\nMonroe Doctrine. Maseden knew that no power on earth would save him now,\r\nbecause Suarez and he could not exist in the same community, and Suarez\r\nwas supreme in the Republic of San Juan--supreme, that is, until some\r\nother cut-throat climbed to the presidency over a rival's corpse.\r\nSteinbaum, a crafty person who played the game of high politics with\r\nsome ability and seldom failed to advance his own and his allies'\r\ninterests, had backed Suarez financially and would become his jackal for\r\nthe time.\r\n\r\nIt was rather surprising that such a master-plotter should have admitted\r\na fore-knowledge of Maseden's fate, and this element in the situation\r\nsuddenly dawned on Maseden himself. The arrest, the trial, and the\r\ncondemnation were alike kept secret.\r\n\r\nThe American consul, a Portuguese merchant, possessed enough backbone to\r\ndemand the postponement of the execution until he had communicated with\r\nWashington, and in this action he would have been supported by the\r\nrepresentative of Great Britain. But he would know nothing about the\r\njudicial crime until it was an accomplished fact.\r\n\r\nHow, then, had some enterprising young lady--\r\n\r\n\"By the way, Steinbaum, you might explain--\"\r\n\r\nMaseden swung on his heel; the matrimonial agent had vanished.\r\n\r\n\"The senor signified that he would return soon,\" said the jailer.\r\n\r\n\"He's gone for the clothes!\" mused Maseden, his thoughts promptly\r\nreverting to the fantastic marriage project. \"The sly old fox is\r\ndevilish anxious to get me spliced before my number goes up. I wonder\r\nwhy? And where in the world will he raise a suitable rig? Hang it all, I\r\nwish I had a little longer to live. This business becomes more\r\ninteresting every minute!\"\r\n\r\nThough he was sure the attempt would be hopeless, Maseden resolved to\r\nmake one last effort. He looked the half-caste squarely in the face.\r\n\r\n\"Get me out of this before Senor Steinbaum comes back and I'll give you\r\ntwenty thousand dollars gold,\" he said quietly.\r\n\r\nThe man met his glance without flinching.\r\n\r\n\"I could not help you, senor, if you paid me a million dollars,\" he\r\nanswered. \"It is your life or mine--those are my orders. And it is\r\nuseless to think of attacking me,\" he added, because for one moment\r\nblack despair scowled menacingly from Maseden's strong features. \"There\r\nare ten men at each door of the corridor ready to shoot you at the least\r\nsign of any attempt to escape.\"\r\n\r\n\"The preparations for the wedding are fairly complete, then?\"\r\n\r\nMaseden spoke Spanish fluently, and the half-caste grinned at the joke.\r\n\r\n\"It will soon be over, senor,\" was all he could find to say.\r\n\r\nThe condemned man knew that the fellow was not to be bribed at the cost\r\nof his own life. He turned again and grew interested once more in the\r\nshaft of sunlight. How quickly it moved! He calculated that before it\r\nreached a certain crack in the masonry he would have passed into\r\n\"yesterday's seven thousand years.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not a pleasing conceit. In self-defense, as it were, he bent his\r\nwits on to the proposed marriage. He was half inclined to regret the\r\nchivalrous impulse which spurred him to agree to it. Yet there was a\r\nspice of humor in the fact that a man who was regarded as an inveterate\r\nwoman-hater by the dusky young ladies of San Juan should be led to the\r\naltar literally at the eleventh hour.\r\n\r\nWhat manner of woman could this unknown bride be? What motive swayed\r\nher? Perhaps it was better not to ask. But if the knot were tied by a\r\npriest, a notary and a European financier, it was evidently intended to\r\nbe a valid undertaking.\r\n\r\nAnd why was Steinbaum so interested? Was the would-be Mrs. Maseden so\r\nwell endowed with this world's goods that she spared no expense in\r\nattaining her object?\r\n\r\nThe most contrary emotions surged through Maseden's conscience. He was\r\nby turns curious, sympathetic, suspicious, absurdly eager to learn more.\r\n\r\nIn this last mood he resolved to have one straight look at the lady.\r\nSurely a man was entitled to see his bride's face! Yes, come what might,\r\nhe would insist that she must raise the \"thick, white veil\" which had\r\nhitherto screened her features from Steinbaum's goggle eyes--supposing,\r\nthat is, the rascal had told the truth.\r\n\r\nA hinge creaked, and the half-caste announced that the senor was\r\nreturning. In a few seconds Steinbaum panted in. He was carrying a\r\ngorgeous uniform of sky-blue cloth with facings of silver braid. As he\r\ndumped a pair of brilliant patent-leather top-boots on the stone floor a\r\nglittering helmet fell from among the clothes and rolled to Maseden's\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\n\"See here, Steinbaum, what tomfoolery is this?\" cried the American\r\nwrathfully.\r\n\r\n\"It is your tomfoolery, not mine,\" came the heated retort. \"Where am I\r\nto get a suit of clothes for you? These will fit, I think. I borrowed\r\nthem from the President's _aide-de-camp_, Captain Ferdinando Gomez.\"\r\n\r\nMaseden knew Captain Gomez--a South American dandy of the first water.\r\nFor the moment the ludicrous side of the business banished all other\r\nconsiderations.\r\n\r\n\"What!\" he laughed, \"am I to be married in the giddy rig of the biggest\r\nass in Cartagena? Well, I give in. As I'm to be shot at eight,\r\nFerdinando's fine feathers will be in a sad mess, because I'll not take\r\n'em off again unless I'm undressed forcibly. Good Lord! Does my unknown\r\nbride realize what sort of rare bird she's going to espouse?...\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes, we're losing time. Chuck over those pants. Gomez is not quite\r\nmy height, but his togs may be O. K.\"\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, Philip Alexander Maseden looked a very fine\r\nfigure of a man when arrayed in all the glory of the presidential\r\n_aide-de-camp_. The only trouble was that the elegant top-boots were\r\nconfoundedly tight, being, in truth, a size too small for their vain\r\nowner; but the bridegroom-elect put up with this inconvenience.\r\n\r\nHe had not far to walk. A few steps to the right lay the \"great hall\"\r\nin which, according to Steinbaum, the ceremony would take place. Very\r\nlittle farther to the left was the enclosed _patio_, or courtyard, in\r\nwhich he would be shot within thirty minutes!\r\n\r\n\"I'm dashed if I feel a bit like dying,\" he said, as he strode by\r\nSteinbaum's side along the outer corridor. \"If the time was about\r\nfourteen hours later I might imagine I was going to a fancy dress ball,\r\nthough I wouldn't be able to dance much in these confounded boots.\"\r\n\r\nThe stout financier made no reply. He was singularly ill at ease. Any\r\ncritical onlooker, not cognizant of the facts, would take him and not\r\nMaseden to be the man condemned to death.\r\n\r\nA heavy, iron-clamped door leading to the row of cells was wide open.\r\nSome soldiers, lined up close to it in the hall, were craning their\r\nnecks to catch a first glimpse of the Americano who was about to marry\r\nand die in the same breath, so to speak.\r\n\r\nBeyond, near a table in the center of the spacious chamber, stood a\r\ngroup that arrested the eye--a Spanish priest, in vestments of\r\nsemi-state; an olive-skinned man whom Maseden recognized as a legal\r\npractitioner of fair repute in a community where chicanery flourished,\r\nand a slenderly-built woman of middle height, though taller than either\r\nof her companions, whose stylish coat and skirt of thin, gray cloth,\r\nand smart shoes tied with little bows of black ribbon, were strangely\r\nincongruous with the black lace mantilla which draped her head and\r\nshoulders, and held in position a double veil tied firmly beneath her\r\nchin.\r\n\r\nMaseden was so astonished at discovering the identity of the lawyer that\r\nhe momentarily lost interest in the mysterious woman who would soon be\r\nhis wife.\r\n\r\n\"Senor Porilla!\" he cried. \"I am glad you are here. Do you understand--\"\r\n\r\n\"It is forbidden!\" hissed Steinbaum. \"One more word, and back you go to\r\nyour cell!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, is that part of the compact?\" said Maseden cheerfully. \"Well, well!\r\nWe must not make matters unpleasant for a lady--must we, Steinbaum?...\r\nNow, madam, raise your veil, and let me at least have the honor of\r\nknowing what sort of person the future Mrs. Philip Alexander Maseden\r\nwill be!\"\r\n\r\nThe only answer was a stifled but quite audible sob, and Maseden had an\r\nimpression that the lady might put a summary stop to the proceedings by\r\nfainting.\r\n\r\nSteinbaum, however, had recovered his nerve in the stronger light of the\r\ngreat hall, especially since the soldiers had gathered around.\r\n\r\n\"The senora declines to unveil,\" he growled in Spanish. \"Begin, _padre_!\r\nThere is not a moment to spare.\"\r\n\r\nThe ecclesiastic opened a book and plunged forthwith into the marriage\r\nservice. Maseden was aware that the shrinking figure by his side was\r\ntrembling violently, and a wave of pity for her surged through his\r\nheart.\r\n\r\n\"Cheer up!\" he whispered. \"It's only a matter of form, anyhow; and I'm\r\nglad to be able to help you. I don't care a red cent what your motive\r\nis.\"\r\n\r\nSteinbaum gurgled ominously, and the bridegroom said no more. Clearly,\r\nthough he had given no bond, he was imperiling the fulfillment of this\r\nunhappy girl's desire if he talked.\r\n\r\nBut he kept his wits alert. It was evident that the lady understood\r\nlittle Latin and no Spanish. She was quite unable to follow the sonorous\r\nphrases. When the portly priest, who seemed to have small relish for the\r\npart he was compelled to play in this amazing marriage, asked Maseden if\r\nhe would have \"this woman\" to be his wedded wife, the bridegroom\r\nanswered \"Yes,\" in Spanish; but a similar question addressed to the\r\nbride found her dumb.\r\n\r\n\"Say 'I will,'\" murmured Maseden in her ear.\r\n\r\nShe turned slightly. At that instant their heads came close together,\r\nand the long, unfamiliar fragrance of a woman's well-tended hair reached\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nIt had an extraordinary effect. Memories of his mother, of a simple\r\nold-world dwelling in a Vermont village, rushed in on him with an\r\nalmost overwhelming force.\r\n\r\nHis superb self-possession nearly gave way. He felt that he might break\r\ndown under the intolerable strain.\r\n\r\nHe feared, during a few seconds of anguish, that he might reveal his\r\nheartache to these men of inferior races.\r\n\r\nThen the pride of a regal birthright came to his aid, and a species of\r\nmost vivid and poignant consciousness succeeded. He heard Steinbaum's\r\ngruff sponsorship for the bride, obeyed smilingly when told to take her\r\nright hand in his right hand, and looked with singular intentness at the\r\nlong, straight, artistic fingers which he held.\r\n\r\nIt was a beautifully modeled hand, well kept, but cold and tremulous.\r\nThe queer conceit leaped up in him that though he might never look on\r\nthe face of his wedded wife he would know that hand if they met again\r\nonly at the Judgment Seat!\r\n\r\nThen, in a dazed way which impressed the onlookers as the height of\r\nAmerican nonchalance, he said, after the celebrant: \"I, Philip\r\nAlexander, take thee, Madeleine--\"\r\n\r\nMadeleine! So that was the Christian name of the woman whom he was\r\ntaking \"till death do us part,\" for the Spanish liturgy provided almost\r\nan exact equivalent of the English service. Madeleine! He had never\r\neven known any girl of the name. Somehow, he liked it. Outwardly so\r\ncalm, he was inwardly aflame with a new longing for life and all that\r\nlife meant.\r\n\r\nHis jumbled wits were peremptorily recalled to the demands of the moment\r\nby the would-be bride's failure to repeat her share of the marriage vow,\r\nwhen it became her turn to take Maseden's hand.\r\n\r\nThe priest nodded, and Steinbaum, now carrying himself with a certain\r\ntruculence, essayed to lead the girl's faltering tongue through the\r\nSpanish phrases.\r\n\r\n\"The lady must understand what she is saying,\" broke in Maseden,\r\ndominating the gruff man by sheer force of will.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" he said, and his voice grew gentle as he turned to the woman he\r\nhad just promised \"to have and to hold,\" \"to love and cherish,\" and\r\nthereto plighted his troth--\"when the priest pauses, I will translate,\r\nand you must speak the words aloud.\"\r\n\r\nHe listened, in a waking trance, to the clear, well-bred accents of a\r\nwoman of his own people uttering the binding pledge of matrimony. The\r\nSpanish sentences recalled the English version, which he supplied with\r\nsingular accuracy, seeing that he had only attended two weddings\r\npreviously, and those during his boyhood.\r\n\r\n\"Madeleine\"--he would learn her surname when he signed the register--was\r\nobviously hard pressed to retain her senses till the end. She was\r\nsobbing pitifully, and the knowledge that her distress was induced by\r\nthe fate immediately in store for the man whom she was espousing \"by\r\nGod's holy ordinance\" tested Maseden's steel nerve to the very limit of\r\nendurance.\r\n\r\nBut he held on with that tenacious chivalry which is the finest\r\ncharacteristic of his class, and even smiled at Steinbaum's fumbling in\r\na waistcoat pocket for a ring. He was putting the ring on the fourth\r\nfinger of his wife's left hand and pronouncing the last formula of the\r\nceremony, when he caught an agonized whisper:\r\n\r\n\"Please, _please_, forgive me! I cannot help myself. I am--more than\r\nsorry for you. I shall pray for you--and think of you--always!\"\r\n\r\nAnd it was in that instant, while breathlessly catching each syllable of\r\na broken plea for sympathy and gage of lasting remembrance, that\r\nMaseden's bemused faculties saw a means of saving his life.\r\n\r\nThough a forlorn hope, at the best, with a hundred chances of failure\r\nagainst one of success, he would seize that hundredth chance. What\r\nmatter if he were shot at quarter to eight instead of at eight o'clock?\r\nSteel before, he was unemotional as marble now, a man of stone with a\r\nbrain of diamond clarity.\r\n\r\nIf events followed their normal and reasonable course, he would be free\r\nof these accursed walls within a few minutes. Come what might, he would\r\nstrike a lusty blow for freedom. If he failed, and sank into eternal\r\nnight, one or more of the half-caste hirelings now so ready to fulfill\r\nthe murderous schemes of President Suarez and his henchman Steinbaum\r\nwould escort an American's spirit to the realm beyond the shadows.\r\n\r\nHe did not stop to think that an unknown woman's strange whim should\r\nhave made possible that which, without her presence in his prison-house,\r\nwas absolutely impossible; still less did he trouble as to the future,\r\nimmediate or remote. His mind's eye was fixed on a sunbeam creeping\r\nstealthily towards a crack in the masonry of that detestable cell.\r\n\r\nHe meant to cheat that sunbeam, one way or the other!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTIME _VERSUS_ ETERNITY\r\n\r\n\r\nHenceforth Maseden concentrated all his faculties on the successful\r\nperformance of the trick which might win him clear of the castle of San\r\nJuan. Nothing in the wide world mattered less to him than that the\r\nnewly-made bride should stoop to sign the register after he had done so,\r\nor that by turning to address Steinbaum he was deliberately throwing\r\naway the opportunity thus afforded of learning her surname.\r\n\r\nWhen an avowed enemy first broached the subject of this extraordinary\r\nmarriage, he had made a bitter jest on the use in real life of a\r\nwell-worn histrionic situation. And now, perforce, he had become an\r\nactor of rare merit. Each look, each word must lead up to the grand\r\nclimax. The penalty of failure was not the boredom of an audience, but\r\ndeath; such a \"curtain\" would sharpen the dullest wits, and Maseden, if\r\nwholly innocent of stage experience hitherto, was not dull.\r\n\r\nHe scored his first point while the bride was signing her name. Beaming\r\non Steinbaum, he said cheerfully:\r\n\r\n\"I bargained for money, Shylock. You've had your pound of flesh. Where\r\nare my ducats?\"\r\n\r\nSteinbaum produced a ten-dollar bill. He even forced a smile. Seemingly\r\nhe was anxious to keep the prisoner in this devil-may-care mood.\r\n\r\n\"Not half enough!\" cried Maseden, and he broke into Spanish.\r\n\r\n\"Hi, my gallant _caballeros_, isn't there another squad in the _patio_?\"\r\n\r\n\"_Si, senor!_\" cried several voices.\r\n\r\nEven these crude, half-caste soldiers revealed the Latin sense of the\r\ndramatic and picturesque. They appreciated the American's cavalier air.\r\nThat morning's doings would lose naught in the telling when the story\r\nspread through the cafes of Cartagena.\r\n\r\nAnd what a story they would have to tell! Little could they guess its\r\nscope, its sensations yet to come.\r\n\r\n\"Very well, then! At least another ten-spot, Steinbaum.... But, mind\r\nyou, sergeant, not a drop till the volley is fired! You might miss, you\r\nknow!\"\r\n\r\nThe man whom he addressed as sergeant eyed the two notes with an amiable\r\ngrin.\r\n\r\n\"You will feel nothing, senor--we promise you that,\" he said wondering,\r\nperhaps, why the prisoner did not bestow the largesse at once.\r\n\r\n\"Excellent! Lead on, friend! I want my last few minutes to myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are some documents to complete,\" put in Steinbaum hastily, with a\r\nquick hand-flourish to the notary.\r\n\r\nSenor Porilla spread two legal-looking parchments on the table.\r\n\r\n\"These are conveyances of your property to your wife,\" he explained. \"I\r\nam instructed to see that everything is done in accordance with the laws\r\nof the Republic. By these deeds you--\"\r\n\r\n\"Hand over everything to the lady. Is _that_ it? I understand. Where do\r\nI sign? Here? Thank you. And here? Nothing else ... Mrs. Maseden, I have\r\ngiven you my name and all my worldly goods. Pray make good use of both\r\nendowments.... Now, I demand to be left alone.\"\r\n\r\nWithout so much as a farewell glance at his wife, who, to keep herself\r\nfrom falling, was leaning on the table, he strode off in the direction\r\nof the corridor into which his cell opened. It was a vital part of his\r\nscheme that he should enter first.\r\n\r\nThe jailer would have left the door open. Maseden was determined that it\r\nshould be closed.\r\n\r\nCaptain Gomez's tight boots pinched his toes cruelly as he walked, but\r\nhe recked little of that minor inconvenience at the moment. In four or\r\nfive rapid paces he reached the doorway and passed through it. There he\r\nturned with his right hand on the door itself, and his left hand,\r\ncarrying the helmet, raised in a parting salute. He smiled most affably,\r\nand, of set purpose, spoke in Spanish.\r\n\r\n\"Good-by, senora!\" he said. \"Farewell, gentlemen! I shall remember this\r\npleasant gathering as long as I live!\"\r\n\r\nThe half-caste was at his prisoner's side, and enjoying the episode\r\nthoroughly. He would swill his share of the wine, of course, and the\r\nhour of the _siesta_ should find him comfortably drunk.\r\n\r\nMaseden flourished his left hand again, and the plumed helmet\r\ntemporarily obscured the jailer's vision. The door swung on its hinges.\r\nThe lock clashed. In the same instant the American's clenched right fist\r\nlanded on the half-caste's jaw, finding with scientific accuracy the\r\ncluster of nerves which the world of pugilism terms \"the point.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a perfect blow, clean and hard, delivered by an athlete. Out of\r\nthe tail of his eye, Maseden had seen _where_ to hit. He knew _how_ to\r\nhit already, and put every ounce of his weight, each shred of his boxing\r\nknowledge, into that one punch.\r\n\r\nIt had to be a complete \"knock-out,\" or his plan miscarried. A cry, a\r\nstruggle, a revolver shot, would have brought a score of assailants\r\nthundering on each door.\r\n\r\nAs it happened, however, the hapless Spaniard collapsed as though he\r\nwere struck dead by heart-failure or apoplexy. Maseden caught the inert\r\nbody before it reached the stone floor, and carried it swiftly into the\r\ncell. Improvising a gag out of his discarded pajamas, he bound the\r\nhalf-caste's hands and feet together behind his back, utilizing the\r\nman's own leather belt for the purpose.\r\n\r\nThese things were done swiftly but without nervous haste. The very\r\nessence of the plan was the conviction that no forward step should be\r\ntaken without making sure that the prior moves were complete and\r\nthorough.\r\n\r\nHe had detached from the jailer's belt a chain carrying a bunch of\r\nkeys and the revolver in its leather holster. Before slipping this\r\nlatter over the belt he was wearing, he examined it. Though somewhat\r\nold-fashioned, it seemed to be thoroughly serviceable, and held six\r\ncartridges with bull-nose bullets of heavy caliber.\r\n\r\nThen he searched the unconscious man's pockets for cigarettes and\r\nmatches. Here he encountered an unforeseen delay. Every Spaniard carries\r\neither cigarettes or the materials for rolling them, but this fellow\r\nseemed to be an exception.\r\n\r\nNow, a cigarette formed an almost indispensable item in Maseden's\r\nscheme; but time was even more precious, and he was about to abandon the\r\nsearch when he noticed that one button-hole of the jailer's tunic was\r\nfar more frayed than any other. He tore open the coat, and found both\r\ncigarettes and matches in an inside breast pocket.\r\n\r\nNot one man in a million, in similar conditions, would have been\r\ncool-headed enough to observe such a trivial detail as a frayed\r\nbutton-hole.\r\n\r\nNext he examined the bunch of keys, and came to the conclusion, rightly\r\nas it transpired, that the same large key fitted the locks of both\r\ndoors; which, however, were heavily barred by external draw-bolts.\r\n\r\nJamming on the helmet--like the glittering boots, it was a size too\r\nsmall--he lowered the chin-strap, lighted a cigarette, and limped\r\nquickly along the corridor towards the _patio_, which filled a square\r\nequal in size to the area of the great hall.\r\n\r\nAs he left the cell he heard the half-caste's breathing become more\r\nregular. The man would soon recover his senses. Would the gag prove\r\neffective? Maseden dared not wait to make sure.\r\n\r\nHe could have induced a more lasting silence, but even life itself might\r\nbe purchased too dearly; he took the risk of a speedy uproar.\r\n\r\nUnlocking the door, with a confident rattling of keys and chain, he\r\nshouted:\r\n\r\n\"Hi, guards! Draw the bolts!\"\r\n\r\nThe soldiers in the _patio_ were ready for some such summons, though the\r\nhour was slightly in advance of the time fixed for the American's\r\nexecution, so the order was obeyed with alacrity. Maseden appeared in\r\nthe doorway, taking care that the door did not swing far back. He blew a\r\ngreat cloud of smoke; growled over his shoulder: \"I'll return in five\r\nminutes,\" pulled the door to, and swaggered past the waiting troops, not\r\nforgetting to salute as they shouldered their rifles.\r\n\r\nA long time afterwards he learned that he actually owed his escape to\r\nCaptain Ferdinando Gomez's tight boots. One of the men was observant,\r\nand inclined to be skeptical.\r\n\r\n\"Who's that?\" he said. \"Not el Capitan Ferdinando, I'll swear!\"\r\n\r\n\"Idiot!\" grinned another. \"Look at his limp! He pinches his toes till he\r\ncan hardly walk.\"\r\n\r\nAt the gateway, or porch, leading to the _patio_, stood a sentry, who,\r\nluckily, was gazing seaward. Maseden conserved the cigarette for another\r\nvolume of smoke, and pulled down the chin-strap determinedly.\r\n\r\nHe got beyond this dragon without any difficulty. Indeed, the man was\r\ntaken by surprise, and only noticed him when he had gone by.\r\n\r\nMaseden was now in a graveled square. Behind him, and to the left, stood\r\nthe time-darkened walls of the old Spanish fortress. In front, broken\r\nonly by a line of trees and the squat humps of six antiquated cannons,\r\nsparkled the blue expanse of the Pacific. To the right lay the port, the\r\nnew town, and such measure of freedom as he might win.\r\n\r\nHe had yet to pass the main entrance to the castle, where, in addition\r\nto a sentry, would surely be stationed some sharp-eyed servants, each\r\nand all on the _qui vive_ at that early hour, and stirred to unusual\r\nactivity by the morning's news, because Cartagena regarded a change of\r\npresident by means of a revolution as a sort of movable holiday.\r\n\r\nAt this crisis, luck befriended him. In the shade of the trees opposite\r\nthe main gate was an orderly holding a horse. The animal's trappings\r\nshowed that it did not belong to a private soldier, and the fact that\r\nthe man stood to attention as Maseden approached seemed to indicate that\r\nwhich was actually the fact--the charger belonged to none other than the\r\npresident's _aide-de-camp_.\r\n\r\nFortune seldom bestows her favors in what the casino-jargon of Monte\r\nCarlo describes as \"intermittent sequences,\" or, in plain language,\r\nalternate _coups_ of red and black, successive strokes of good and bad\r\nluck. The fickle goddess rather inclines to runs on a color. Having\r\nbrought Maseden to the very brink of the grave, she had decided to help\r\nhim now.\r\n\r\nAs it turned out, Gomez's soldier servant had been injured during the\r\novernight disturbance, and the deputy was a newcomer.\r\n\r\nHe saluted, held bridle and stirrup while Maseden mounted, and strolled\r\ncasually across the square to inquire whether he ought to wait or go\r\nback to his quarters. He succeeded in puzzling the very sergeant who was\r\nmentally contriving the best means of securing the lion's, or\r\nsergeant's, share of twenty dollars' worth of wine.\r\n\r\n\"Captain Gomez has not gone out,\" snapped the calculator. \"Get out of\r\nthe way! Don't stand there like the ears of a donkey! I have occupation.\r\nThe Senor Steinbaum is putting a lady into his car, and she is very\r\nill.\"\r\n\r\nSo the trooper was unceremoniously brushed aside. A little later he\r\nmight have reminded the sergeant of the folly of counting chickens\r\nbefore the eggs are hatched.\r\n\r\nMaseden was a first-rate horseman, but, owing to the discomfort of\r\nexcruciatingly tight boots and a wobbly helmet, he did not enjoy the\r\nfirst half mile of a fast gallop down the winding road which he was\r\nobliged to follow before he could strike into the country. Beneath, to\r\nthe left, and on a plateau in front, were respectively the ancient and\r\nmodern sections of Cartagena. But, having succeeded thus far, he had\r\nmade up his mind inflexibly as to the course he would pursue.\r\n\r\nHe meant to reach his own ranch, twelve miles inland, within the hour.\r\nHe reckoned that, in the easy-going South American way, it would not be\r\noccupied as yet by an armed guard. An officer had rummaged among his\r\npapers that morning, but came away with the others.\r\n\r\nIn any event, in that direction, and there only, lay any real chance of\r\nultimate safety.\r\n\r\nOn his estate there were two men at least in whom he might place trust;\r\nand even if he could not enter the house, one of them might obtain for\r\nhim the clothes and money without which he had not the remotest prospect\r\nof getting away alive from the Republic of San Juan.\r\n\r\nHe had pocketed Steinbaum's twenty dollars in order to hire a horse, but\r\nthe unwitting hospitality of Captain Gomez had provided him with a\r\nbetter animal than was to be picked up at the nearest _posada_. Indeed,\r\nwith the exception of an automobile, a luxury that was few and far\r\nbetween in Cartagena, he could not have secured a swifter or more\r\nreliable conveyance than this very steed, which would cover the twelve\r\nmiles in less than an hour, and had also saved him a quarter of an\r\nhour's running walk, an experience savoring of Chinese torture when\r\nundertaken in tight boots.\r\n\r\nThe notion of possible pursuit by a party of soldiers in a car had\r\nbarely occurred to him when he heard the rapid panting of an automobile\r\nin the rear.\r\n\r\nHe slackened pace, took a shorter grip of the reins, and loosened the\r\nrevolver in its case. Flight was ridiculous, unless he made across\r\ncountry; a last resource, involving a fatal loss of time.\r\n\r\nHe took nothing for granted. Steinbaum was one of the half-dozen\r\ncar-owners in Cartagena, and this was surely he, escorting Senor Porilla\r\nand the lady back to the town.\r\n\r\nThey might pass him without recognition. If they didn't, he would shoot\r\nSteinbaum and put a bullet into a tire. There would be no half measures.\r\nSuarez and his ally had declared war on him to the death, and war they\r\nwould have without stint or quarter.\r\n\r\nIt was a ticklish moment when the fast-running car drew near. Maseden\r\naffected to bend over and examine the horse's fore action, as though he\r\nsuspected lameness or a loose shoe. He gave one swift underlook into the\r\nlimousine as it sped by and fancied he saw Porilla, seated with his\r\nback to the engine, bending forward.\r\n\r\nThat was all. The car raced on and was speedily lost in a dust-cloud.\r\n\r\nSo far, so good. He was dodging peril in the hairbreadth fashion\r\npopularly ascribed to warriors on a stricken field. Yet his mount was\r\nhardly in a canter again before he was plunged without warning into the\r\nmost ticklish dilemma of all.\r\n\r\nSteinbaum's car had just turned to the left, where the road bifurcated a\r\nfew hundred yards ahead, when another car came flying down the other\r\nroad--that which the fugitive himself must take for nearly half a mile;\r\nand this second menace harbored no less a personage than Don Enrico\r\nSuarez, president of the Republic of San Juan!\r\n\r\nIt was an open car, too, and the president was seated alone in the\r\ntonneau.\r\n\r\nMaseden jumped to the instant conclusion that his enemy was hurrying to\r\nwitness his execution, probably to jeer at him for having ventured to\r\ncross the predestined path of a conqueror. But, even though he passed,\r\nSuarez would know that the gaily bedizened horseman was not his\r\nglittering _aide-de-camp_.\r\n\r\nTo permit the president to reach the Castle meant the beginning of an\r\nirresistible pursuit within five minutes. However, that consideration\r\ndid not bother the Vermonter if for no better reason than that he was\r\ndetermined it should not come into play.\r\n\r\nHe smiled thoughtfully, adjusted the helmet once more, and voiced his\r\nsentiments aloud.\r\n\r\n\"Good!\" he said. \"This time, Enrico, you and I square accounts!\"\r\n\r\nPulling up, he took the middle of the road, wheeling the horse \"half\r\nleft,\" and holding up his right hand. The chauffeur saw him, slackened\r\nspeed, and finally halted within a distance of a few feet. From first to\r\nlast, the man regarded the newcomer as being Captain Gomez. The\r\nwind-screen was up, and the roads were dust-laden, so he could not see\r\nwith absolute accuracy. Moreover, events followed each other so rapidly\r\nthat he was given no chance to correct an erroneous first impression.\r\n\r\nThe car being stopped, Maseden moved on, passing by the left. Drawing\r\nthe revolver, he fired at the front right-hand tire at such close range\r\nthat it was impossible to miss. The reports of the weapon and the\r\nbursting tube were simultaneous.\r\n\r\nThe next shot would have lodged in the president's heart if the startled\r\nhorse had not swerved. As it was, quite a nasty hole was torn in the\r\npresidential anatomy; Suarez, himself fumbling for an automatic pistol,\r\nsank back in the tonneau a severely if not mortally wounded man.\r\n\r\nFor one fateful instant, the eyes of the two had met and clashed, and\r\nrecognition was mutual.\r\n\r\nA third bullet plowed through the back right-hand tire, and Maseden\r\ngalloped off, the horse being only too eager to get away from the\r\nracket.\r\n\r\nThe American did not look behind to ascertain what the chauffeur was\r\ndoing. It really did not matter a great deal. Speed and direction were\r\nthe paramount conditions during the next fifty minutes. The die was cast\r\nnow beyond all hope of revocation. He was at war with the Republic, and,\r\nalthough he had rendered its citizens a valuable service in shooting\r\ntheir rascally president, they might not regard the incident in its\r\nproper light until a period far too late to benefit the philanthropist.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, interesting historically and otherwise, the\r\nchauffeur was convinced that Captain Ferdinando Gomez had assassinated\r\nhis master, and said so, with many oaths, when he summoned assistance\r\nfrom a neighboring house. It may also be placed on record here that\r\nabout the same time the gallant _aide-de-camp_ had come to suspect that\r\nhis beautiful uniform, if not returned promptly, might be sadly smirched\r\nby a score of bullets, with accessories; and was kicking up a fearful\r\nrow because no one could get at the jailer and rescue that gala costume\r\nbefore the prisoner was led forth to execution.\r\n\r\nIn a word, the Republic's presidential affairs were greatly mixed, and\r\nremained in inextricable confusion until long after Maseden drew rein on\r\na blown horse at the gate of his own _estancia_.\r\n\r\nThe ranch, known as Los Andes, and one of the finest estates in San\r\nJuan, provided the original bone of contention between Maseden and\r\nSuarez. It had been built up, during thirty lazy years, by a distant\r\ncousin of Suarez, an elderly bachelor, who grew coffee and maize, and\r\nreared stock in a haphazard way.\r\n\r\nSeven years earlier he had met the young American in New York, took a\r\nliking to him, and offered to employ him as overseer while teaching him\r\nthe business. The pupil soon became the instructor. Scientific methods\r\nwere introduced, direct markets were tapped, and the produce of the\r\nestate was quadrupled within a few seasons.\r\n\r\nThen the older man died, and left the ranch and its contents to his\r\nassistant. There was not much money--the capital was sunk in stock and\r\nimprovement--so a number of free and independent burghers of Cartagena\r\nreceived smaller amounts than they expected.\r\n\r\nSuarez was one of the beneficiaries, seven in all. Six took the\r\nsituation calmly. He alone was irreconcilable, and blustered about legal\r\nproceedings, only desisting when persuaded that he had no case, even for\r\nthe venal courts of San Juan.\r\n\r\nAnd now, on that sultry January morning, the lawful owner of the Los\r\nAndes ranch, while awaiting the appearance of a peon, who, he knew, was\r\ntending some cattle in a byre behind the lodge, was wondering whether or\r\nnot he might urge a tired charger into a final canter to the door of his\r\nown house without bringing about a pitched battle when he arrived there.\r\n\r\nAt last came Pedro--every second man in South America is named after the\r\nchief of the Apostles--a brown, lithe, Indian-looking person. But he was\r\nSpanish enough in the expression of his emotions.\r\n\r\n\"By the eleven thousand virgins!\" he cried joyously, after a first stare\r\nof incredulity, for the eyes rolled in his head at sight of Maseden's\r\ngarb, \"it is not true, then, master, that you are a prisoner!\"\r\n\r\n\"Who says that I am?\" inquired Maseden.\r\n\r\n\"They say it up there at the _estancia_, senor,\" and Pedro jerked a\r\nthumb towards an avenue of mahogany trees.\r\n\r\n\"They say? Who say?\"\r\n\r\nPedro was scared, but Maseden had taught his helpers to answer\r\ntruthfully.\r\n\r\n\"Old Lopez said it, senor. He told me the president's men had charged\r\nhim to touch nothing till they returned.\"\r\n\r\nMaseden's heart throbbed more furiously at that reply than at aught\r\nwhich had befallen him during the few pregnant hours since dawn.\r\n\r\n\"Those rascals have gone, then?\" he said, so placidly that the peon was\r\nbewildered.\r\n\r\n\"_Si, senor._ Did they not go with you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. I was not sure of all.... Close and lock the gate, Pedro. Leave\r\nother things. Saddle your mustang and mount guard at the bend in the\r\navenue, from which you can watch the Cartagena road. If you see horses,\r\nor an automobile, coming this way, ride to the house and tell me.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Si, senor._\"\r\n\r\nPedro hurried off. Maseden rode on at the best pace the spent horse was\r\ncapable of. He might lose a potential fortune--though the shooting of\r\nSuarez should remove the worst of the hostile influences arrayed against\r\nhim--but surely he could now save his life.\r\n\r\nHe had never realized how dear life was at twenty-eight until that\r\nmorning. Hitherto he had given no thought to it. Now he wanted to live\r\ntill he was eighty!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nADIOS, SAN JUAN\r\n\r\n\r\nSuarez was not dead. He was not even dangerously wounded. A two-ounce\r\nbullet had dealt an upper left rib a blow like the kick of a horse, but\r\nat such an angle that the bone deflected its flight. Consequently, a\r\nfractured sternal costa, loss of blood, and a most painful flesh wound\r\nformed for Suarez the collective outcome of Maseden's disturbed aiming.\r\n\r\nIn effect, the president regained consciousness about the time Captain\r\nGomez had succeeded in persuading several members of the new government\r\nthat it was not he, but an escaped prisoner, who had so grievously\r\nmaltreated the head of the Republic.\r\n\r\nA doctor announced that Senor Suarez must be given complete rest and\r\nfreedom from public affairs during the ensuing week or ten days. Even\r\nthe wrathful president himself, after making known the true identity of\r\nhis assailant, felt that he had no option other than placing the affairs\r\nof the nation temporarily in the hands of his associates.\r\n\r\nHe made the best of an awkward situation, therefore, and issued a\r\nvainglorious decree announcing the change.\r\n\r\nNow, even San Juan could not provide a second revolution within\r\ntwelve hours. States, like human beings, can experience a surfeit\r\nof excitement; moreover, the next gang of office-seekers had not yet\r\nemerged from the welter of parties. Sometimes, too, in South America,\r\na disabled president is preferable to an active one, because the\r\nheads of departments can do a little pilfering on their own account.\r\n\r\nSo San Juan became virtuously indignant over the \"attempted\r\nassassination\" of that renowned \"liberator,\" Enrico Suarez. A hue and\r\ncry was raised for the scoundrelly American, several supporters of real\r\nlaw and order in the State were arrested, and cavalry and police rode\r\nforth on Maseden's trail.\r\n\r\nThis planning and scheming and explaining consumed valuable time,\r\nhowever. It was high noon when a party of horsemen, headed by a\r\nwell-informed guide, in the person of the ranch superintendent, \"old\"\r\nLopez, tore along the avenue of mahogany trees at Los Andes.\r\n\r\nLopez, a wizened, shrewd, and sufficiently trustworthy half-breed, was\r\nnot betraying his employer. He was merely carrying out explicit\r\ninstructions. Maseden had no desire to place his faithful servants in\r\nthe power of the Cartagena harpies. He was literally fighting for his\r\nlife now. He meant to meet violence with greater violence, guile with\r\ndeeper guile.\r\n\r\nWhen a Covenanter buckles on the sword, let professional swashbucklers\r\ntake heed; when an honest man plots, let rogues beware. A clear-headed\r\nAmerican, armed against oppression, can be at once a most lusty warrior\r\nand the astutest of strategists.\r\n\r\n\"It is the unexpected that happens,\" said Disraeli in one of his\r\nhappiest epigrams. A few strenuous hours spent in the Republic of San\r\nJuan in Maseden's plight would have yielded the cynic material for a\r\ndozen like quips, if he had survived the experience.\r\n\r\nWhen Maseden reached the _estancia_ he was received by Lopez with even\r\ngreater amazement than was displayed by the peon. Being a privileged\r\nperson, the old fellow expressed himself in absolutely untranslatable\r\nlanguage. After a lurid preamble, he went on:\r\n\r\n\"But, thanks to the heavenly ones, I see you again, senor, safe and\r\nsound, though in a strange livery. Is it true, then, that the president\r\nis dead?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Both of them, I believe.\"\r\n\r\nMaseden laughed wearily. He was tired, and the day was only beginning.\r\nHe knew, of course, that Lopez meant Valdez, having probably, as yet,\r\nnot so much as heard of Suarez as chief of the Republic.\r\n\r\n\"I'll explain matters,\" he said. \"Stand by to catch me if I fall when I\r\ndismount. The devil take all dudes and their vanities! These boots have\r\nnearly killed me.\"\r\n\r\nIn a minute the offending jack boots were off and flung into the\r\nveranda, the helmet after them. The horse was given over to the care of\r\na peon, and Maseden went to his bedroom.\r\n\r\nA glance at a big safe showed that the letter lock had defied curiosity,\r\nand no serious attempt had been made to force it. He saw that the\r\ndrawers in a bureau in the adjoining room had been ransacked hastily.\r\nProbably, the new president's emissaries were instructed to look for a\r\nlist of \"conspirators\"--of well-affected citizens, that is--who meant to\r\nsupport the honorable _regime_ of Valdez.\r\n\r\n\"Now, listen while I talk,\" said Maseden, tearing open the tight-fitting\r\nblue coat. \"I can put faith in you, I suppose?\"\r\n\r\n\"Senor--\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I take it for granted. Besides, if you stick to me you may come\r\nout on top yourself. Valdez is dead. He was murdered last night, and\r\nEnrico Suarez stepped into his shoes.... Oh, I know Enrico's real name,\r\nbut I haven't a second to spare. I was sentenced to death early this\r\nmorning, and married about an hour ago, just before being taken out to\r\nbe shot.... Well, I got away; how--is of no concern to you. In fact, it\r\nis better that you shouldn't know.\r\n\r\n\"A lady will come into possession here. She will call herself the Senora\r\nMaseden. Senor Porilla will introduce her. She and the lawyer are\r\nplaying some game to suit Suarez and Steinbaum, the German consul at\r\nCartagena. My escape may bother them a bit, but I cannot guess just how\r\nthings will work out. What orders did Enrico's lieutenant give you?\"\r\n\r\nThe foreman's wits were rather mixed by his master's extraordinary\r\nbudget of news, but he answered readily.\r\n\r\n\"He told me, senor, if I valued my life, to see that nothing was\r\ndisturbed in the _estancia_ till the president came or sent a\r\nrepresentative.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought so. That gives me a sporting chance.\"\r\n\r\nMaseden had changed rapidly into his own clothes, an ordinary riding\r\ncostume suitable to a tropical climate. He opened the safe, stuffed some\r\npapers into his pockets, also a quantity of gold, silver, and notes.\r\n\r\nThen he wrote a letter, and filled in a check. Having addressed and\r\nstamped the envelope, he handed it to his assistant.\r\n\r\n\"In five minutes or less, you will be riding at a steady gallop towards\r\nCartagena,\" he said. \"If possible, deliver that letter yourself to Senor\r\nPeguero, the American consul. By 'possible' I mean if you are not held\r\nup by soldiers or police on the way. Otherwise, keep it concealed, and\r\npost it when the opportunity serves.\"\r\n\r\nLopez knew the pleasant methods of his fellow-republicans.\r\n\r\n\"They may search me, senor,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Not if you do as I tell you. Curse me fluently enough, and they'll look\r\non you as their best friend.\"\r\n\r\n\"Senor!\" protested the old man.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. I mean it. Call me all the names you can lay tongue to. When I\r\nleave this room I'll follow you, revolver in hand. Be careful to scowl\r\nand act unwillingly. I want some food and a couple of bottles of wine,\r\nalso a leather bottle full of water and a tin cup. Saddle the Cid, and\r\nsee that three or four good measures of corn are put in the saddle-bags\r\nwith the other things.\r\n\r\n\"When I vanish rush to the stables, pick out a good mustang, and be in\r\nCartagena within the hour. If not interfered with, take the letter to\r\nSenor Peguero. Don't wait for an answer, but hurry at top speed to the\r\nCastle, where you must tell some one that I came back to the ranch and\r\nordered you about at the muzzle of a revolver.\r\n\r\n\"Lead the soldiers straight here. If Captain Gomez is in command, assure\r\nhim that you rescued his uniform, and he'll be your friend forever.\r\nShould you meet them on the way, turn back with them. You understand?\r\nYou're for the president and against me.\"\r\n\r\nLopez smiled till his face was a mass of wrinkles. He was beginning to\r\nsee through the scheme, and was Spaniard enough to appreciate the leaven\r\nof intrigue.\r\n\r\n\"But when and where shall I find you, senor, if you are taking a long\r\njourney?\" he said, still grinning.\r\n\r\n\"Not a mile away, if all goes well. Soon after dusk come to the Grove of\r\nthe Doves at sunset. I'll turn up. If you are delayed, and it is dark,\r\nhoot like an owl, and I'll answer. If you don't come at all I'll know\r\nit's too dangerous, and will be there again at dawn, at noon, and at\r\nsunset to-morrow. Pick up some news in Cartagena. You will be told, of\r\ncourse, that I have shot Suarez. Be careful to show your horrified\r\nsurprise, and ask if the dear man is really dead. If he is, try and find\r\nout who is in power. Of course there's a bare chance that Porilla may be\r\nmade president, in which case I might be given a fair trial when an\r\nAmerican man-of-war is anchored in the roads.... Oh, by the way, you\r\nmight find out who the lady is I married this morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Senor!\" gasped Lopez, in sheer bewilderment.\r\n\r\n\"I haven't the remotest notion who she is, or even what she looks like,\"\r\nlaughed Maseden. \"Now, there's no more time for talk,\" and he raised his\r\nvoice. \"Obey me at once, you lazy old hound, or I'll blow your brains\r\nout! Send a peon for the Cid. Fail me in one single thing, and I'll put\r\na bullet through your head!... Margarita! Some bread and meat, quick!\r\nI'll soon show you who is master in this house. Suarez may give orders\r\nin Cartagena, but I give them here!\"\r\n\r\nLopez hurried out, wringing his hands. Maseden followed, brandishing the\r\nrevolver. Some timid servants, who had gathered in the _patio_ at the\r\nnews of their employer's return, made as though they would run, but he\r\nstopped them with a fierce threat, and, while munching the food brought\r\nby an aged housekeeper, behaved and spoke so outrageously that they\r\nthought he was mad.\r\n\r\nPoor creatures! They had served him well in the past. Now he was trying\r\nto save their lives by giving them something to say against him when\r\nquestioned by the president's henchmen.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, he had a sharp ear for the hoof-beats of a galloping horse.\r\nPedro, knowing nothing of the scene in the _estancia_, was still on\r\nguard at the bend in the avenue, and might be trusted to give warning of\r\nthe enemy's approach. But Maseden was allowed to eat his fill.\r\n\r\nA very terrified Lopez brought a hardy-looking mustang to the gateway,\r\nand his master saw a repeating rifle slung to the saddle. That was a\r\nthoughtful thing. Such a weapon might be exceedingly useful.\r\n\r\n\"Where are the cartridges?\" he thundered.\r\n\r\n\"Here, most excellent one,\" stammered the other, producing a bandolier.\r\n\r\nThe American swung into the saddle, swore at his co-conspirator\r\nheartily, and was off.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSo Lopez had a fine tale to tell when his mustang loped up to the\r\nentrance of the Castle of San Juan. He had a fine tale to hear, too, as\r\nhe rode back to the ranch with a body of horse led by the fastidious and\r\ncolor-loving Ferdinando Gomez.\r\n\r\nThe servants, of course, bore out the superintendent's story of\r\nMaseden's extraordinary behavior. Obviously, no one at the _estancia_\r\nwas to blame for this daring prisoner's second escape. The officer who\r\nhad arrested him at daybreak should have left a guard in charge, but the\r\nplain truth was that the Cartagena men had been so anxious to take part\r\nin the stirring doings anticipated at the capital that no heed was given\r\nto this flaw in the procedure.\r\n\r\nThat night, however, when Maseden met Lopez at the rendezvous, the\r\nSpaniard's account of events was not reassuring.\r\n\r\nSuarez was living, and not very badly hurt, it was true; but every man's\r\nhand seemed to be against the foreigner who had tried to kill him.\r\nMaseden was puzzled, at first, by this excess of patriotism on the part\r\nof the citizens of Cartagena and San Juan generally.\r\n\r\n\"What do they think has become of me?\" he inquired.\r\n\r\n\"They argue, senor, that you have ridden into the interior, and\r\ntelegrams have been sent to all the inland towns ordering your instant\r\narrest. If you resist you are to be shot dead, and a reward of one\r\nthousand dollars will be paid when you are identified.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do they pay for me dead only?\"\r\n\r\n\"They offer two thousand for you alive, senor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just to have the pleasure of potting me as per schedule.... Any fear\r\nthat you have been followed to-night, old friend?\"\r\n\r\n\"None, senor. The soldiers at the _estancia_ believe you are many miles\r\naway. Moreover, I have put good wine on the table.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who is in charge there? Captain Gomez?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, senor, a stranger. _El capitan_ went back to Cartagena. He nearly\r\nwept when he saw his boots. You had split them.\"\r\n\r\n\"You gave the consul my letter?\"\r\n\r\n\"I dropped it in his box, senor. I thought that was wiser.\"\r\n\r\n\"So it was. I should have remembered that. What of the lady?\"\r\n\r\n\"The lady you married, senor?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course. You wouldn't have me interested in some other lady on my\r\nwedding day, you old reprobate?\"\r\n\r\nThe half-breed laughed softly.\r\n\r\n\"Even that wouldn't be so strange a thing as what has really happened,\r\nsenor. No one knows who the lady is. One man, a distant cousin of mine,\r\ntold me he heard she landed from a ship only late last night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Great Scott!\" muttered Maseden in English, \"what a Sphinx-like person!\r\nShe must be descended from the Man in the Iron Mask.\" Then he went on:\r\n\r\n\"Didn't your cousin know where she was staying in Cartagena? Surely\r\nthere must have been a good deal of public curiosity about her. Twenty\r\npeople were present at the marriage. It was no secret.\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand that she had gone to Senor Steinbaum's house. She fainted\r\nafter the ceremony, my cousin said, and had to be carried into an\r\nautomobile, but he knew nothing more.\"\r\n\r\nThe veiled Madeleine had felt the strain, then! Somehow the knowledge of\r\nher collapse touched a chord of sentiment in Maseden's heart, but his\r\nown desperate plight effectually banished all other considerations at\r\nthe moment.\r\n\r\nTrue, he was safe for the night, and for many days to come, if the\r\nforeman's fidelity remained unshaken. The ranch was called Los Andes\r\nbecause it contained a chain of little hills all covered with valuable\r\ntimber, among which he could hide without real difficulty.\r\n\r\nBut of what avail this precarious lurking on his own estate? He must\r\ntake speedy and effectual steps to get clear of San Juan altogether\r\nuntil such time as he could secure adequate protection, and have his\r\ncase thrashed out by a tribunal to whose decision even Enrico Suarez,\r\nthe president of the Republic, must bow.\r\n\r\nOne thing was quite certain--never again could he settle down in\r\nunmolested possession of his property. Though the shooting of Suarez was\r\nan unfortunate necessity, its effect would be enduring and disastrous.\r\n\r\nHe had thought out every phase of the problem during the long, hot hours\r\nbeneath the trees, and the half-breed's account of the trend of public\r\nfeeling decided his adoption of the boldest course of all. He would go\r\nto Cartagena, where he was hardly known, save to a few merchants and\r\nshopkeepers, a banker and one or two members of the Consular community,\r\nand board some outward-bound vessel.\r\n\r\nFortunately, he had plenty of money, and, glory be, could speak both\r\nSpanish and the San Juan patois like a native. If his luck held, he\r\nwould cheat Suarez yet.\r\n\r\n\"Lopez,\" he said, after a long pause, \"I must leave the ranch for many a\r\nday, probably forever. If I stay here I'll only plunge you into trouble\r\nand get myself captured. Now, do me one last service. Have you any\r\nclothes belonging to that _vaquero_ nephew of yours who broke his neck\r\nin a race last Easter?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have his overalls, a _fiesta_ jacket, some shirts and a sombrero,\r\nsenor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bring them, and speedily. I'll give you a good price.\"\r\n\r\n\"They are yours for nothing, senor.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't deal on those terms, Lopez. Off with you. I'll wait here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Anything else, senor?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. I was nearly forgetting. Bring his saddle, too. My own saddle\r\nmight be recognized. I have a long ride before me, so hurry.\"\r\n\r\nWithin half an hour the good-hearted old foreman was richer by five\r\nhundred dollars, while Maseden, a dashing cowboy, though unkempt as to\r\nface and hands, was riding across country by starlight.\r\n\r\nHe did not tell Lopez his real objective. There was no need. The old\r\nfellow occasionally indulged in a burst of dissipation, and if his\r\ntongue wagged then he might blurt out some boastful phrase which would\r\nbring down on him the merciless wrath of the authorities.\r\n\r\nAt dawn the fugitive received another slice of real luck. He had just\r\nentered a main road leading from San Luis, a town thirty miles from\r\nCartagena, when he came upon a cowherd sitting by the roadside and\r\nbemoaning his misfortunes. The man was commissioned to drive some cattle\r\nto a sale-ring in the city, and had scratched an ankle rather badly\r\nwhile whacking one of the steers out of a bed of thorns.\r\n\r\nSuch an incident was common enough in his life, but on this occasion\r\neither the thorn was poisonous or some foreign matter had lodged in the\r\nwound, because the limb had swollen greatly and was so painful that he\r\ncould hardly walk.\r\n\r\nMaseden played the Good Samaritan. He ascertained the drover's name, his\r\nmaster's, and the address of the salesman; the rest was easy. Helping\r\nthe sufferer into a wayside hovel, he promised to send back a messenger\r\nlater with an official receipt, took charge of the animals himself, and\r\nreached Cartagena as Ramon Aliones, the accredited representative of a\r\nSan Luis rancher.\r\n\r\nThe sale-ring was near the harbor, and he mounted a man on his own\r\nbroncho to deliver the drover's voucher for the safe arrival of the herd\r\nat its destination. He asked for, and obtained, a duplicate, which he\r\nkept. This same emissary readily disposed of the horse and saddle at a\r\nruinous price when told that the newcomer was not only thirsty, but\r\nmeant to see the sights of the capital.\r\n\r\nA cheap restaurant, some wineshops, and a vile billiard saloon provided\r\nshelter for the rest of the day. Before night fell, Maseden had\r\nascertained three things: He was supposed to be riding hard into the\r\ninterior; the lady he had married was really a stranger and was\r\nSteinbaum's guest, and a large steamer, the _Southern Cross_, flying the\r\nStars and Stripes, was due to leave port at midnight.\r\n\r\nShe should have sailed some hours earlier, but the drastic changes in\r\nthe marine department entailed by the day's happenings had delayed\r\ncertain formalities connected with her manifests.\r\n\r\n\"For a time, senor,\" explained the ship's chandler who gave him this\r\nlatter information, \"no one would sign anything. You see, a name on a\r\npaper would prove conclusively which president you favored. You\r\nunderstand?\"\r\n\r\nMaseden understood perfectly.\r\n\r\n\"It is well that you and I, senor, have no truck with these presidents,\r\nor we might be in trouble,\" he laughed. \"As it is, another bottle, and\r\nto the devil with all politicians!\"\r\n\r\nUnder cover of the darkness the American slipped away from his boon\r\ncompanions, now comfortably drunk at his expense. Having no luggage, he\r\nbought a second-hand leather trunk and some cheap underclothing, such as\r\na muleteer might reasonably possess. He also secured the repeating rifle\r\nand cartridges which he had left in a restaurant, and, thus reinforced,\r\nmade for the Plaza, where Cartagenians of both sexes and all ages were\r\ngathered to enjoy the cool breeze that comes from the Pacific with\r\nsunset.\r\n\r\nFrom that point he knew he could see the _Southern Cross_ lying at\r\nanchor in the roadstead. She was there, sure enough, nearly a mile out,\r\nand he was puzzling his wits for a pretext to hire a boat and board her\r\nwithout attracting notice when chance solved the problem for him.\r\n\r\nTwo men passed. They were talking English, and he heard one addressing\r\nthe other by name.\r\n\r\n\"Tell you what, Sturgess,\" the speaker was saying, \"I'd be hull down on\r\nCartagena to-night if the skipper would only bring up at Valparaiso. But\r\nhis first port of call is Buenos Ayres, and I've got to make Valparaiso\r\nbefore I see good old New York again, so here I'm fixed till a coasting\r\nsteamer comes along. Great Caesar's ghost, I wish I were going with you!\"\r\n\r\nThe second man, Sturgess, was carrying a suitcase, and the two were\r\nevidently making for a short pier which supplied landing places for\r\nsmall craft at various stages of the tide.\r\n\r\nMaseden quickened his pace, overtook them, and said in Spanish that he\r\nwished to book a passage to Buenos Ayres on the _Southern Cross_, and,\r\nif the Senor Americano would permit him to board the vessel in his boat,\r\nhe (Maseden) would gladly carry the bag to the pier.\r\n\r\nSturgess evidently did not understand Spanish, and asked his companion\r\nto interpret. He laughed on hearing the queer offer.\r\n\r\n\"Guess I can handle the grip myself, and the gallant _vaquero_ is pretty\r\nwell loaded with his own outfit,\" he said, \"but he is welcome to a trip\r\non my catamaran, if it's of any service.\"\r\n\r\nMaseden, however, insisted on giving some return for the favor, and\r\nsecured the suitcase. Now, if any sharp-eyed watcher on the pier saw\r\nhim, he would pass as the traveler's servant.\r\n\r\nWithin half an hour he was aboard the ship, and had bargained for a\r\nspare berth in the forecastle with the crew. He would be compelled to\r\nrough it, and remain as dirty and disheveled as possible until the ship\r\nreached Buenos Ayres. Obviously, no matter what his personal wrongs\r\nmight be, he could not make the captain of the _Southern Cross_ a party\r\nto the escape from Cartagena of the man who had nearly succeeded in\r\nridding the republic of its president.\r\n\r\nBut the prospect of hard fare and worse accommodations did not trouble\r\nhim at all. He had nearly ten thousand dollars in his pockets. If the\r\nnote sent through Lopez to the American Consul was acted on promptly, a\r\nfurther sum of fifteen thousand dollars lying to his credit in a local\r\nbank was now in safe keeping.\r\n\r\nReally, considering that he had been so near death that morning, he had\r\na good deal to be thankful for if he never saw Cartagena or the Los\r\nAndes ranch again.\r\n\r\nAs for the marriage, what of it? A knot so easily tied could be untied\r\nwith equal readiness. He hadn't the least doubt but that an American\r\ncourt of law would declare the ceremony illegal.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, he could jump that fence when he reached it. At present, in\r\nsporting phrase, he was going strong with a lot in hand.\r\n\r\nHe kept well out of sight when a government launch came off, and a port\r\nofficial boarded the vessel.\r\n\r\nHe never knew what a narrow escape he had when the chief steward who\r\nacted as purser, was asked if any new addition had been made to the\r\npassenger list. The ship's officer was not a good Spanish scholar. He\r\nthought the question applied to the cargo, and answered \"no.\"\r\n\r\nThen, after a wait that seemed interminable, the snorting and growling\r\nof a steam winch and the unwilling rasp of the anchor chain chanted a\r\nsymphonic chorus in Maseden's ears. Those harsh sounds sang of freedom\r\nand life, of golden years on a most excellent earth instead of an\r\neternity in the grave. He came on deck to watch the Castle of San Juan\r\ndwindle and vanish in the deep, blue glamour of a perfect tropical\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nHe was standing on the open part of the main deck, close to the fore\r\nhold, when he heard English voices from the promenade deck high above\r\nhis head.\r\n\r\nA man's somewhat querulous accents reached him first.\r\n\r\n\"Well, at this time two days ago, I little thought I'd be on a steamer\r\ngoing south to-night,\" said the speaker.\r\n\r\nThere was no answer, though it was evident that the petulant philosopher\r\nwas not addressing the silent air.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose you girls are still mooning about that fellow getting away\r\nfrom the Castle?\" grumbled the same voice. \"I tell you he has no\r\nearthly chance of winning clear. Steinbaum will see to that. His record\r\nis none too good, and a question in the American Senate would just about\r\nfinish him, even in San Juan. So Mr. Philip Alexander Maseden might just\r\nas well have been shot yesterday morning as to-day or to-morrow. They're\r\nhot on his track now, Steinbaum told me--\r\n\r\n\"Eh? Yes, I know he did _me_ a good turn, but, damn it all, that was\r\nmerely because he was going to die, not because he was a first-rate life\r\nfor an insurance office. It was no business of mine that he and Suarez\r\ncouldn't agree.... Oh, let's go to our cabins! Tears always put my\r\nnerves on a raw edge! Anyone would think you had lost a real husband on\r\nyour wedding day!\"\r\n\r\nThere was a movement of shadowy forms. Maseden thought he could\r\ndistinguish a woman's white hand rest for an instant on the ship's rail.\r\nWas that the hand he thought he would remember until the Day of\r\nJudgment? He could not say.\r\n\r\nThe one fact that lifted itself out of the welter of incoherent fancies\r\nwhirling in his mind was an almost incontrovertible one. If his ears had\r\nnot deceived him, he and his unknown but lawful wife were\r\nfellow-passengers on board the _Southern Cross_!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\"FIND THE LADY\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA slight mist hung over the sea--sure outcome of the tremendous range of\r\nthe thermometer between noon and midnight in a tropical clime. The sky\r\nwas cloudless, and the stars clustered in myriads.\r\n\r\nThough the Southern Hemisphere falls far short of the glory of the north\r\nin constellations of the first magnitude, the extraordinary clearness of\r\nthe upper air near the equator enhances the stellar display. It would\r\nalmost seem that nature knows she may veil her ample splendors in the\r\nnorth, but must make the most of her scantier charms in the south.\r\n\r\nMaseden, swinging on his heel in sheer bewilderment, suddenly found\r\nhimself face to face with the Southern Cross, hanging low above the\r\nhorizon. Had an impossible meteor flamed forth from the familiar cluster\r\nof stars and shot in awe-inspiring flight across the whole arc of the\r\nheavens northward to the line, it would not have surprised him more than\r\nthe discovery that his \"wife\" was on board the ship.\r\n\r\nThat was a stupendous fact before which the whirl of adventure of the\r\nlong day now drawing to a close subsided into calm remoteness.\r\n\r\n\"Madeleine,\" the woman he had married, was his fellow-passenger! He\r\nwould surely see her many times during the voyage to Buenos Ayres! He\r\nwould hear her voice, which he could not fail to recognize.\r\n\r\nShe, on her part, would probably identify him at the first glance. How\r\nwould she handle an extraordinary situation? Would she claim him as her\r\nhusband, repudiate him scornfully, or utterly ignore him? He could not\r\neven guess.\r\n\r\nThere was no telling what a woman would do who had elected to marry a\r\nman whom she had never met, whose very name, in all likelihood, she had\r\nnever heard, merely because he happened to be a prisoner condemned to\r\nspeedy death.\r\n\r\nYet she could not be a particularly cold-blooded person. She had wept\r\nfor him, had whispered her heartfelt grief; had promised to pray for and\r\nthink of him always. Even the man with the high-pitched voice of a\r\nhypochondriac--presumably, from the manner of his address, her\r\nfather--had hinted that her suffering had already passed the bounds set\r\nfor one who, to serve her own ends, had gone through that amazing\r\nceremony.\r\n\r\nMaseden did not actually marshal his thoughts thus clearly. If compelled\r\nto bend his wits to the task, he might have spoken or written in such\r\nwise. But an active brain has its own haphazard methods of weighing a\r\nnew and distracting problem; it will ask and answer a dozen startling\r\nquestions simultaneously.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of Maseden's strange and formless imaginings the ship's\r\ncourse was changed a couple of points to the southward, and the Southern\r\nCross was shut out of sight by the forecastle head. Then, and not until\r\nthen, did the coincidence of the vessel's name with that of the\r\nconstellation occur to his bemused wits.\r\n\r\nHe laughed cheerfully.\r\n\r\n\"By gad!\" he said, \"all the signs of the zodiac must have clustered\r\nabout my horoscope on this 15th of January. When I get ashore I must\r\nfind an astrologer and ask him to expound.\"\r\n\r\nThe sound of his own voice brought a belated warning to Maseden of the\r\nfolly he had committed in speaking aloud.\r\n\r\nThere was no other occupant of the fore deck at the moment. A look-out\r\nman in the bows could not possibly have overheard, because of the\r\nwhistling of the breeze created by the ship's momentum and the plash of\r\nthe curved waves set up by the cut-water, and it was highly improbable\r\nthat words uttered in a conversational tone would have reached the\r\nbridge.\r\n\r\nBut behind him rose the three decks of the superstructure, and there\r\nmight be eavesdroppers on the promenade deck or in one of the two dark\r\ngangways running aft.\r\n\r\nHe glanced over his shoulder to right and left. Apparently he had\r\nescaped this time. No matter what developments took place in the near\r\nfuture, he was by no means anxious as yet to reveal his nationality.\r\nEach hour brought home, more and more forcibly, the misfortune of the\r\nchance which left him no alternative but the shooting of Suarez that\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nThe act was absolutely essential to his own safety, but it put him\r\nclearly out of court. At any rate, the authorities of no South American\r\nstate would listen to a recital of his earlier wrongs. If, as was highly\r\nprobable, a sensational account of the attempted assassination of the\r\nnew president had been tacked on to the telegrams announcing the _coup\r\nd'etat_ in San Juan, and he, Maseden, were painted as a desperado of\r\nmark, it might even be feared that the settled and respectable Argentine\r\nRepublic would arrest him and endeavor to send him back to San Juan for\r\ntrial.\r\n\r\nOf course, the United States Consul in Buenos Ayres would have something\r\nto say about it, but there was a very real danger of consular efforts\r\nbeing overruled. No matter how distasteful the role, Philip Alexander\r\nMaseden must continue to masquerade as Ramon Aliones, _vaquero_, until\r\nhe could leave the ship and assume another alias.\r\n\r\nIt was soon borne in on him how narrow was the margin which still\r\nseparated him from disaster. He had gone to his berth, an unsavory hutch\r\nnext to a larger cabin tenanted by deck-hands, when the door was thrust\r\nwide (he had left it half open while undressing, there being no electric\r\nswitch within) and a lamp flashed in his eyes.\r\n\r\nA short, stockily-built man, whom Maseden rightly took for the captain,\r\nstood there, accompanied by another man, seemingly a Spanish steward.\r\n\r\n\"Now, then,\" came the gruff question, \"what's this I hear about your\r\nspeaking English to yourself? Who are you? What's your name?\"\r\n\r\nLuckily, Maseden was so surprised that he did not answer. The swarthy\r\nsteward, a thin, lantern-jawed person, grinned. Maseden saw that the man\r\nwas wearing canvas shoes with india-rubber soles, and guessed the truth\r\ninstantly.\r\n\r\nHis nerve had been tested many times that day; nor did it fail him now.\r\nGazing blankly at the captain, he said, in Spanish, that he did not\r\nunderstand.\r\n\r\n\"Tell him, Alfonso, that you heard him speaking English a few minutes\r\nsince.... Hi, you! Stop that! No smoking in your berth.\"\r\n\r\nMaseden was rolling a cigarette in true Spanish style. The captain was\r\nobviously suspicious, so the situation called for a touch of stage\r\nartistry.\r\n\r\nAlfonso translated, pricking his ears for Maseden's reply. But he hailed\r\nfrom the east coast, whereas Maseden used the _patois_ of San Juan.\r\n\r\n\"You made a natural mistake, senor,\" said the American easily. \"I was\r\ntalking to the stars, a habit of mine when alone on the _pampas_, and\r\ntheir names would sound somewhat like the words of a barbarous tongue.\"\r\n\r\n\"And a foolish habit, too!\" commented the captain when he heard the\r\nexplanation. \"Do you know any of 'em?\" and he glanced up at the strip of\r\nsky visible from where he stood.\r\n\r\nThe smiling _vaquero_ stepped out on to the open deck. Oh, yes, all the\r\nchief stars were old friends of his. He pointed to the \"Sea-serpent,\"\r\nthe \"Crow,\" and the \"Great Dog,\" giving the Spanish equivalents.\r\n\r\nThe steward, of course, densely ignorant in such things, and already\r\nhalf convinced that he had blundered, was only anxious now to avoid\r\nbeing rated by the captain for having gone to him with a cock-and-bull\r\nstory. Somehow, Maseden sensed this fact, and made smooth the path.\r\n\r\n\"They are strange names,\" he said with a laugh, \"but we of the plains\r\noften have to find the way on land as a sailor on the sea.\"\r\n\r\n\"Has he any papers?\" demanded the captain, apparently satisfied that the\r\npassenger was really acquainted with the chief star-groups.\r\n\r\nMaseden produced that thrice-fortunate duplicate of the receipt for\r\ncattle brought from the San Luis ranch to Cartagena by Ramon Aliones\r\nthat very day. The captain examined it, and turned wrathfully on the\r\nsteward.\r\n\r\n\"Be off to the devil!\" he growled. \"Find some other job than bothering\r\nme with your fool's tales!\"\r\n\r\nWhen Alfonso had vanished, he added, seemingly as an afterthought:\r\n\r\n\"If I was a _vaquero_ with a dirty face, I wouldn't worry about clean\r\nfingernails or wear silk underclothing, and I'd do my star-gazing in\r\ndumb show!\"\r\n\r\nWith that he, too, strode away. Undoubtedly, the captain of the\r\n_Southern Cross_ was no fool.\r\n\r\nFive minutes later the silk vest and pants which Maseden had not\r\ntroubled to change while donning the gay attire of old Lopez's nephew,\r\nwent into the Pacific through the small port-hole which redeemed the\r\ncabin's otherwise stuffy atmosphere. Happily the bunk, though crude,\r\nwas clean, and long enough to hold a tall man.\r\n\r\nMaseden fancied he would lie awake for hours. In reality, he was dead\r\ntired, and slept the sleep of sheer exhaustion until wakened by a\r\nloud-voiced intimation that all crimson-hued Dagoes must rouse\r\nthemselves if they didn't want to be stirred up by a hose-pipe.\r\n\r\nNow, if there was one thing more than another that Maseden liked when\r\non board ship, it was a cold salt-water bath. But he dared neither\r\ntake a bath nor wash his face. Personal cleanliness is not a marked\r\ncharacteristic of South American cowboys. That he should display\r\nclose-cropped hair instead of an abundance of oiled and curly tresses\r\nwas a fact singular enough in itself, without inviting attention by\r\nthe use of soap and water.\r\n\r\nPerforce, he remained filthy. The captain's hint was very much to the\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nThe _Southern Cross_ was not a regular passenger boat. Primarily a\r\ntrader, carrying nitrate or grain to home ports, and coal thence to\r\nvarious points on the southern or western seaboard of South America,\r\nshe was equipped with a few cabins, about a dozen all told, on the upper\r\ndeck.\r\n\r\nThe so-called second-class accommodation was several degrees worse than\r\nthe steerage on a crack Atlantic liner. That is to say, the human\r\nfreight ranked a long way after cargo. The food was plentiful, though\r\nrough. Even for saloon passengers there was neither stewardess nor\r\ndoctor.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of course, a passenger list would be an absurdity. The chief\r\nsteward acted as purser, and knew the names of all on board after five\r\nminutes' study of his ledger. Passengers and ship's officers soon became\r\nacquainted. Within twenty-four hours Maseden had ascertained that a Mr.\r\nJames Gray, with his two daughters, occupied staterooms; but, for the\r\nlife of him, he could not learn the ladies' Christian names.\r\n\r\nHe cudgeled his brains to try and remember whether or not his \"wife\" had\r\nsigned the register as Madeleine Gray; but the effort failed completely.\r\nHe knew why, for the best of reasons; yet the knowledge did not render\r\nfailure less tantalizing.\r\n\r\nIt is one thing to be dazzled by the prospect of escape from the seeming\r\ncertainty of death within a few minutes, but quite another to be on the\r\nsame ship as the lady you have married two days earlier, yet neither\r\nknow her name nor be positive as to her identity.\r\n\r\nThis, however, was literally Maseden's predicament when chance favored\r\nhim with a long, steady look at the Misses Gray. He could not be\r\nmistaken, because there were no other ladies on board.\r\n\r\nThus when a very pretty girl, wearing a muslin dress and hat of Leghorn\r\nstraw, appeared at the forward rail of the promenade deck and gazed\r\nwistfully out over the sea, Maseden's heart fluttered more violently\r\nthan he would have thought possible as the effect of a casual glance at\r\nany woman.\r\n\r\nSo, then, this fair, slim creature, whose unheeding eyes had dwelt on\r\nhim for a fleeting second ere they sought the horizon, was his wife! It\r\nwas an extraordinary notion; fantastic, yet not wholly unpleasing. It\r\nwould be rather a joke, if opportunity offered, to flirt with her. He\r\nhad never flirted with any girl, and hardly knew how to begin; but much\r\nreading had taught him that the lady herself might prove an admirable\r\ncoach if so minded.\r\n\r\nOf course, there was room for error in one respect. He might have\r\nmarried the sister, who, thus far, nearly midday, had not been visible\r\nduring daylight. He calculated the pros and cons of the situation. If\r\nhis \"wife\" was feeling the strain of that unnerving experience in the\r\ngreat hall of the Castle of San Juan, she might now be resting in her\r\nstateroom. But why should the sister, on whose shoulders, one would\r\nsuppose, sat no such heavy load of care, come on deck alone and scan the\r\nblue Pacific with that dreamy air?\r\n\r\nYes, by Jove, this really must be his wife! Somehow, poetic justice\r\ndemanded that she, and not her sister, should meet him thus\r\nunconsciously.\r\n\r\nIn covert fashion he began to study her. The deck on which she stood was\r\nfully twenty feet above him, and she was still further separated from\r\nhim by some thirty feet of the fore hatch, but he noted that her eyes\r\nwere of the Parma violet tint so frequently met with in the heroines of\r\nfiction, yet all too seldom seen in real life. Being a mere man, he was\r\nnot aware that blue eyes in shadow assume that exact tint. At any rate,\r\nas eyes, they were more than satisfactory.\r\n\r\nHer nose was well modeled, with broad, flexible nostrils, unfailing\r\nsign of good health and an equable disposition. Her lips were prettily\r\ncurved, and the oval face, framed in a cluster of brown hair, was poised\r\non a perfectly molded neck. She owned shapely arms; he had already had\r\noccasion to admire her hands; a small, neatly-shod foot was visible\r\nunder the lowest rail as the girl leaned on her elbows in an attitude\r\nof unstudied grace.\r\n\r\nAltogether, Mr. Maseden liked the looks of Mrs. Maseden!\r\n\r\nHe was beginning to revel in sentiment when the edifice of seemingly\r\nsubstantial fact so swiftly constructed by a fertile imagination was\r\ndissipated into space by hearing a voice--_the_ voice, he was\r\nsure--coming from some unseen part of the upper deck.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! There you are, Nina!\" it said. \"I've been looking for you\r\neverywhere! How long have you been here?\"\r\n\r\nNina! So this fairy was only the _sister_. Maseden smiled grimly behind\r\na cloud of cigarette smoke because of the absurd shock which the words\r\nadministered. He was sharply aware of a sense of disappointment, a\r\nfeeling so far-fetched as to be almost ludicrous.\r\n\r\nWhat in the world did it matter to which of these two he was married?\r\nIn all probability he would never exchange a word with either, and his\r\nfirst serious business on reaching a civilized country would be to get\r\nrid of the incubus with which a set of phenomenal circumstances alone\r\nhad saddled him.\r\n\r\nAt last, however, he would really see his wife, and thus end one phase\r\nof a curious entanglement. Nina had half turned. Evidently she realized\r\nthat Madeleine meant to join her. Maseden leaned back against the\r\nexternal paneling of his cubby-hole and looked aloft now with curiosity\r\nat once quickened and undisguised.\r\n\r\nBut he was fated to suffer many minor shocks that day. Madeleine\r\nappeared, and presented such an exact replica of Nina that, at first\r\nsight, and in the strong shadows cast by the canvas screen which alone\r\nrendered that portion of the deck habitable while the sun was up, it was\r\npractically impossible for a stranger to differentiate between them.\r\n\r\nMaseden discovered later that Madeleine was twenty-two and Nina nearly\r\ntwenty-four; but the marked resemblance between the pair, accentuated\r\nby their trick of dressing alike, led people to take them for twins.\r\nMoreover, each so admirably duplicated the other in voice and mannerisms\r\nthat only near relatives or intimate friends could be certain which was\r\nspeaking if the owner of the voice remained invisible.\r\n\r\nFor a little while, too, Maseden's mind was reduced to chaos by hearing\r\nNina address her sister as \"Madge.\" He was vouchsafed the merest glimpse\r\nof Madge's face, because, after a quick, heedless look at him and at a\r\nhalf-caste sailor readjusting the hatches covering the fore hold, she\r\nturned her back to the rail and said something that Maseden could not\r\noverhear.\r\n\r\nA man joined the two girls, whereupon Nina also faced aft. The newcomer,\r\nstanding well away under the screen, could not be seen at all, and\r\nMaseden thought it must be Mr. Gray, the querulous person whose\r\noutspoken utterances had first warned Maseden that his wife was on\r\nboard.\r\n\r\nBut he erred again. Some comment passed by Nina raised a laugh, and\r\nMaseden recognized the voice of Mr. Sturgess, whose baggage he had\r\ncarried overnight.\r\n\r\n\"I guess _not_!\" he was saying, with a humorous stress on each word. \"As\r\na summer resort, San Juan disagreed with my complaint, Miss Gray.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you been ill, then?\" came the natural query.\r\n\r\n\"No, but I might have been had I remained there too long,\" was the\r\nanswer. \"A change of president in one of these small republics is like a\r\nbad railroad smash--you never know who'll get hurt. I've a notion that\r\nMr. Gray must have felt sort of relieved when he brought you two young\r\nladies safe and sound aboard this ship.\"\r\n\r\n\"We didn't see anything specially alarming,\" said Nina. \"Madge went out\r\ntwice during the day with Mr. Steinbaum, a trader, and the streets were\r\nvery quiet, she thought.\"\r\n\r\nMadge! Was \"Madge\" a family diminutive for Madeleine? Maseden neither\r\nknew nor cared. Nina's harmless chatter had told him the truth. Madge\r\nmost certainly did find the streets quiet, if the story brought by Lopez\r\nfrom Cartagena was correct; namely, that she had been carried out of the\r\nCastle in a dead faint.\r\n\r\nAnd now the heartless creature was actually laughing!\r\n\r\n\"One cannot take a South American revolution quite seriously--it always\r\nhas something comical about it,\" she cried, and it was astounding how\r\nclosely the one sister's voice resembled the other's. \"I understand that\r\nsome poor people were shot the night before last, but I saw a man who\r\nkeeps a restaurant opposite Mr. Steinbaum's house produce a device with\r\nflags and a scroll. On the scroll was painted 'Long Live Valdez.' He\r\ndrew some fresh letters over the first part of the name, dabbed on\r\nplenty of black and white paint, and the new legend ran 'Long Live\r\nSuarez.' The whole thing was done, and the flags were out, in less than\r\nfive minutes.\"\r\n\r\nSturgess evidently asked for and obtained permission to smoke. He came\r\nto the rail. Both girls faced forward again, and Maseden was free to\r\ncompare them.\r\n\r\nMadge, or Madeleine, as he preferred to style her, seemed to be a trifle\r\npaler than Nina. Otherwise, her likeness to her sister was almost\r\nuncanny, if that ill-omened word might be applied to two remarkably\r\npretty girls. Neither of the girls wore gloves, but Maseden looked in\r\nvain for the heavy gold wedding-ring which Steinbaum's thoroughness had\r\nsupplied when wanted.\r\n\r\nAt that moment an officer appeared on the main deck. The fore hold had\r\nto be opened, it seemed. A quartermaster, summoned from the forecastle,\r\nhoisted a block and tackle to a derrick. The noise effectually drowned\r\nthe talk of the trio on the upper deck until the tackle was rigged, and\r\na couple of hatches were removed. The half-caste sailor was about to\r\ndescend into the hold just as Sturgess's somewhat staccato accents\r\nreached Maseden clearly again.\r\n\r\n\"Say, did you ladies hear of the American who was to be shot early\r\nyesterday morning? A most thrilling yarn was spun by a friend of mine\r\nwho knows Cartagena from A to Z. He said--\"\r\n\r\nMaseden was on the alert to detect the slightest variation of expression\r\non Madeleine's face. She bent forward, her hands tightly clutching the\r\nrail, and darted a piteous under look at her sister. Thus it happened\r\nthat Maseden alone was gazing upward, and he saw, out of the tail of\r\nhis eye, the heavy block detaching itself from the derrick and falling\r\nstraight on top of the sailor, who had a leg over the coaming of the\r\nhatch and a foot on the first rung of the iron ladder leading down into\r\nthe hold.\r\n\r\nWith a quickness born of many a tussle with a bucking broncho, Maseden\r\nleaped, caught the rope held by the quartermaster, and jerked it\r\nviolently. The block missed the half-caste by a few inches, and clanged\r\nin the hold far beneath.\r\n\r\nThe tenth part of a second decided whether the sailor should be dashed\r\nheadlong into the depths or left wholly unscathed. As it was, he and\r\nevery onlooker realized that the rakish-looking _vaquero_ had saved his\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nIn the impulsive way of his race, the man darted forward, threw his arms\r\naround Maseden's neck, and kissed him. To his very great surprise, his\r\nrescuer thrust him off, and said angrily:\r\n\r\n\"Don't be such a damn fool!\"\r\n\r\nAn exclamation, almost a slight scream, came from the upper deck.\r\nMaseden knew in an instant that this time he had blundered beyond\r\nrepair. Madeleine had heard his voice, and had recognized him. Moreover,\r\nthe officer, the quartermaster, even the grateful Spaniard, were eyeing\r\nhim with unmixed amazement.\r\n\r\nThe fat _was_ in the fire this time! In another moment would come\r\ndenunciation and arrest, and then--back to the firing squad! What should\r\nhe do?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nROMANCE RECEIVES A COLD DOUCHE\r\n\r\n\r\nBut none of these thoughts showed in Maseden's face. He laughed easily\r\nand explained in voluble Spanish that he swore in English occasionally,\r\nhaving picked up the correct formula from an American senor with whom\r\nhe once took a hunting trip into the interior.\r\n\r\nThe sailor, hearing this flow of a language he understood, and not able\r\nto measure the idiomatic fluency of Maseden's English, accepted the\r\nstory without demur, but the fourth officer and quartermaster, both\r\nAmericans, were evidently puzzled.\r\n\r\nHe soon got rid of the too-effusive half-caste, and retired to his\r\nberth. Thank goodness, since the one person on board mainly concerned\r\nwas perforce aware of his identity, he was free to wash his face and\r\ntake a bath! To oblige a lady he would have remained unwashed all the\r\nway to Buenos Ayres; now, every other consideration might go hang.\r\n\r\nFinding a steward, he gave further cause for bewilderment by asking to\r\nbe allowed to use a bath-room.\r\n\r\nGreatly to Maseden's relief, his lapse into the vernacular seemed to\r\nevoke little or no comment subsequently. The captain heard of it, but\r\nwas far too irritated by the faulty behavior of a ring-bolt (examination\r\nshowed a bad flaw in the metal) to pay any special heed. As for the\r\nhalf-caste sailor, his gratitude to Maseden took the form of describing\r\nhim admiringly as \"the _vaquero_ who could swear like an _Americano_,\"\r\nan equivocal compliment which actually fostered the belief that Maseden\r\nwas what he represented himself to be--a vagabond cowboy migrating from\r\none coast of the great South American continent to the other.\r\n\r\nHis peculiar habits, therefore, shown in such trivial details as a\r\ndesire for personal cleanliness and a certain fastidiousness at table,\r\nwere attributed to the same exotic tutelage. Of course, when he spoke\r\nany intelligent Spaniard could have detected faults in phrase or\r\npronunciation, but he had a ready resource in the _patois_ of San Juan,\r\nand no man on board was competent to assess him accurately by both\r\nstandards.\r\n\r\nHe settled down quickly to the exigencies of life at sea. Five days\r\nafter leaving Cartagena he was an expert in the matter of keeping his\r\nfeet when the vessel was rolling or pitching, or performing a corkscrew\r\nmovement which combined the worst features of each.\r\n\r\nWhen the _Southern Cross_ entered more southerly latitudes her\r\npassengers were given ample opportunity to test their skill in this\r\nrespect. The weather grew colder each day, and with the drop in the\r\nthermometer came gray skies and rough seas.\r\n\r\nThere are two tracks for ocean-going steamers bound down the west coast.\r\nThe open Pacific offers no hindrance to safe navigation, except an\r\noccasional heavy gale. The inner course, through Smyth's Channel, is\r\nsheltered but tortuous, and the commander of the _Southern Cross_\r\nelected to save time by heading direct for the Straits of Tierra del\r\nFuego. The ship was speedy and well-found. A stiff nor'wester tended\r\nrather to help her along, and she should reach Buenos Ayres within\r\nfifteen days.\r\n\r\nMaseden contrived to buy a heavy poncho, or cloak, from one of the crew.\r\nWrapped in this useful garment, he patrolled the small space of deck at\r\nhis disposal, and kept an unfailing eye for the reappearance at the\r\nfor'ard rail of one or other of the Misses Gray; yet day after day\r\nslipped by and they remained obstinately hidden.\r\n\r\nOnce or twice, when the weather permitted, he climbed to the fore deck,\r\nwhence he could scan a large part of the promenade deck on both the port\r\nand starboard sides. On the port side, however, a wind-screen\r\nintervened.\r\n\r\nTwice he thought he saw Madeleine Gray leaning on the port rail, talking\r\nto Sturgess--and wearing the very dress in which she was married! Either\r\nby accident or design she vanished almost instantly on each occasion.\r\n\r\nIt was nonsensical, of course, but he began to harbor a sentiment of\r\nannoyance with Sturgess, who, by some queer contriving of fortune,\r\nseemed to be drawn rather to the company of Madeleine than of sister\r\nNina. Any real feeling of jealousy would have been absurd, almost\r\nludicrous, under the circumstances.\r\n\r\nFor all that, Maseden couldn't understand why the fellow apparently\r\ndevoted himself to the company of one sister to the neglect, or\r\nintentional exclusion, of the other; while the lady's behavior, assuming\r\nthat she knew of the presence of her \"husband\" within a few yards, was,\r\nto say the least, reprehensible if not provocative.\r\n\r\nBy this time, Maseden was fully convinced that his wife had recognized\r\nhim. Oddly enough, the somewhat bizarre costume he wore would help in\r\nbetraying him to her eyes. She had seen him only when arrayed in even\r\nmore startling guise. Her memory of him, therefore, would depend wholly\r\non his features and physique, and the incongruity of an unmistakably\r\nAmerican voice coming from a _vaquero_ could not fail to be enhanced by\r\nthe gala attire affected by that erstwhile gay spark, old Lopez's\r\nnephew.\r\n\r\nMoreover, Maseden had bribed the forecastle steward to find out from one\r\nof the saloon attendants what had happened to the two ladies on the\r\npromenade deck when the pulley fell. One of them, the man said, was so\r\nstartled that she nearly fainted, and the American senor had carried her\r\nto a chair.\r\n\r\nObviously, on an American vessel, with American officers, engineers, and\r\nquartermasters, for one whose only tongue was Spanish it was difficult\r\nto extract information. The Spanish-speaking members of the crew knew\r\nlittle or nothing of the passengers, while Maseden's part of the ship\r\nwas as completely shut off from the saloon as are the dwellings of the\r\npoor from the palaces of the rich.\r\n\r\nMany times was he tempted to change his quarters, and thus tacitly admit\r\nhis identity; but cold prudence as often forbade any such folly. Even if\r\nthe full extent of his adventures in Cartagena were unknown on board, it\r\nwas a quite certain thing that the story must have reached Buenos Ayres\r\nlong ago.\r\n\r\nBad as was the odor of the republic in the outer world, it still\r\npossessed the rights of a sovereign state, and the last thing Maseden\r\ndesired was an enforced return to the Castle of San Juan, there to stand\r\nhis trial anew for conspiracy, plus an undoubted attempt to murder the\r\npresident! That would be a stiff price to pay merely in order to sate\r\nhis curiosity as to the motive underlying a woman's strange whim.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn the sixth night of the voyage the opportunity for which he was\r\nlooking was offered as unexpectedly as it had been persistently withheld\r\nearlier.\r\n\r\nAfter a very unpleasant day of wind and rain the weather improved\r\nmarkedly. True, the sky had not cleared, and the darkness which fell\r\nswiftly over a leaden sea was of a quality almost palpable.\r\n\r\nHad he troubled to recall the sealore gleaned from many books of travel,\r\nMaseden would have known that such a change was by no means indicative\r\nof smoother seas and days of sunshine in the near future. The ship was\r\nmerely crossing the center of a cyclonic area. Ere morning she would\r\nprobably meet a fiercer gale than that through which she had just\r\npassed.\r\n\r\nSuch minor considerations as to the state of the elements carried little\r\nweight, however, when contrasted with the immediate and solid fact that\r\nMaseden, giving an upward eye to the promenade deck about nine o'clock,\r\ndiscerned a solitary female figure leaning on the rail.\r\n\r\nSince there were no other women on board, this must be either Madeleine\r\nor Nina. As it happened, the forecastle was deserted, in the sense that\r\nits usual occupants were either asleep or busied with the duties of the\r\nhour. Above the girl's head paced the officer of the watch. Up in the\r\nbows were two men on the look-out. Otherwise, the fore part of the ship\r\nwas untenanted save for Maseden himself and the slim, cloaked form which\r\nseemed to be peering aimlessly into the impenetrable wall of darkness\r\nahead.\r\n\r\nApparently the wind had died down. There were no sounds save the normal\r\nones--the onward rush of the ship, the swish of an occasional swell\r\ncleft by the cut-water, the steady thud of the screw, and the equally\r\nregular creaking of planks and panels swollen by heavy rain after\r\nundergoing tropical heat.\r\n\r\nIt was a night rich with suggestion of mystery and romance. Some new\r\nichor stirred in Maseden's veins, firing his spirit to emprise. Come\r\nwhat might, he resolved to have speech with the lady, be she wife in\r\nname or merely sister-in-law!\r\n\r\nBut how contrive it? If he hailed her from the main deck, the officer on\r\nthe bridge would overhear, and straightway play a domineering hand in\r\nthe game. If he went aft, through a narrow gangway leading past the\r\nengine-room and various officers' cabins, he could reach a sliding door\r\ngiving access to the saloon companion, but his presence there would\r\nundoubtedly be noticed, evoking a stern order to betake himself to his\r\nown quarters.\r\n\r\nThe third method was the direct one. A series of iron rungs led\r\nvertically up the face of the superstructure, and, as sailors\r\noccasionally passed that way, the girl would not necessarily be\r\nalarmed by seeing a man coming up.\r\n\r\nThe officer on duty might detect him, of course; but even he was liable\r\nto mistake him for one of the ship's company.\r\n\r\nIt has been seen already that Maseden was of the rare order of mankind\r\nwhich, having once made up its mind, acts unhesitatingly. No sooner had\r\nhe elected for the iron ladder than he had crossed the deck and was\r\nmounting rapidly. It chanced that the officer did not see him.\r\n\r\nIn a few seconds he was standing on the promenade deck. Then he had an\r\nattack of stage-fright. Many an actor has strode valiantly from wings to\r\nfootlights only to find his tongue glued to the roof of his mouth. This\r\nwas Maseden's \"star turn,\" and not a word could he utter!\r\n\r\nBy a singular coincidence, the lady was equally nervous. She gave scant\r\nattention to the commonplace occurrence that a member of the crew should\r\nwalk aft from the dim interior of the forecastle and hurry up the\r\nladder, but the situation altered dramatically when a faint gleam from\r\na window of the smoking-room fell on the tarnished silver braid and gilt\r\nbuttons of Maseden's jacket of black cloth and velvet.\r\n\r\nThe light, such as it was, fell directly on the girl's face as she\r\nturned towards the intruder. Her eyes, blue sapphires by day, were now\r\nstrangely dark. Maseden saw that her expression was one of panic if not\r\nof actual terror. He was unpleasantly reminded of a bird fascinated by a\r\nsnake; the displeasing simile stirred his wits and unlocked his tongue.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry if I have frightened you,\" he said quietly, \"but the chance\r\nof securing a few words of explanation seemed too good to be lost. You\r\nowe me something of the kind, don't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" came the truly feminine reply.\r\n\r\n\"Because, unless I am greatly mistaken, you are the lady whom I had the\r\nhonor of marrying in the Castle of San Juan at Cartagena. You may be\r\nknown as Miss Madge Gray on board this ship, but your name in the\r\nregister was Madeleine.\"\r\n\r\n\"My name is Nina, not Madge.\"\r\n\r\nMaseden was taken aback for a few seconds, yet the fact could not be\r\ngainsaid that the speaker, whether Madge or Nina, did not repudiate the\r\ngeneral accuracy of his statement. Moreover, he was almost sure of his\r\nground now. His \"wife\" was probably flirting with Sturgess. Nina, as\r\nusual, was left to her own devices, since the forecastle steward had\r\nreported that Senor Gray was ill and confined to his cabin.\r\n\r\n\"At any rate, you do not deny that either your sister or yourself is\r\nlegally entitled to pose as Mrs. Philip Alexander Maseden?\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"I am not aware that either of us can fairly be described as posing in\r\nthat distinguished capacity.\"\r\n\r\nThe retort was glib enough. It amused the man.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps I put the bald truth rather awkwardly,\" he said. \"Let me, then,\r\nask a plain question. Did I marry you, or your sister, last Tuesday\r\nmorning?\"\r\n\r\n\"You certainly err if you think that I shall discuss the affairs of my\r\nfamily with a complete stranger,\" was the unhesitating answer.\r\n\r\n\"Yet you, or your sister, did not scruple to marry one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are _you_ Mr. Maseden?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am. Haven't I said so? I implied it, at any rate.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then why are you in disguise, posing--it is your own word--as a Spanish\r\ncowboy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I'm trying to save my miserable life. Don't think me\r\nungrateful, madam. I owe my escape to the phenomenal circumstances\r\nbrought about by the desire of a charming young lady to become\r\nMrs. Maseden, if only for a brief half hour. I am not claiming\r\nany--privileges, shall I say?--on that account. But I can hardly credit\r\nthat, having gone through the ordeal of such a ceremony, you would\r\nrefuse to tell me your motive, so I reluctantly revert to my first\r\nopinion, namely, that your sister is my wife.\"\r\n\r\n\"Reluctantly! Why reluctantly?\"\r\n\r\nThere was more than a touch of bewilderment in the cry. Maseden\r\ninterpreted it as a fencer's trick to gain time.\r\n\r\n\"I don't mind being absolutely candid,\" he laughed. \"You see, time hangs\r\nheavy on my hands here. I have nothing to do except watch for a glimpse\r\nof an unknown wife. Queer, isn't it? Anyhow, my fate doesn't seem to\r\nworry sister Madge, who finds consolation elsewhere; so, of the two, if\r\nI must be wed to one of you, I imagine I would prefer you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think you are intolerably rude, Mr. Maseden. Madge was right when she\r\nsaid--\"\r\n\r\nShe checked herself with a little gasp of dismay. Maseden laughed again.\r\n\r\n\"Please don't spare me,\" he cried. \"What did Madge say?\"\r\n\r\n\"I decline to discuss the matter any further.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why should we quarrel over a minor point? You have tacitly\r\nadmitted that your sister married me. Give me some notion of her motive.\r\nThat is all I ask. It may help.\"\r\n\r\n\"How help?\"\r\n\r\n\"When I take unto myself a wife I expect to be allowed some freedom of\r\nchoice in the matter. I certainly refuse to have her picked for me by a\r\nrascal like Steinbaum. If I win clear of Buenos Ayres and reach New York\r\nI shall take the speediest steps to undo the matrimonial knot tied in\r\nCartagena. There may be legal complications, which will be attended, I\r\nsuppose, by a certain amount of publicity. It will help some, as Mr.\r\nSturgess would say, if I know just why the lady wanted to wed in the\r\nfirst instance. Surely there is reason behind that simple request. Your\r\nsister begged to be allowed to marry me because I was condemned to\r\ndeath. At least, such was Steinbaum's story. Was _that_ true, to begin\r\nwith?\"\r\n\r\nNo answer. Maseden felt that he had cornered her.\r\n\r\n\"There must have been some such ground for an extraordinary action,\" he\r\nwent on. \"To the best of my knowledge she had never seen me. I question\r\nif she even knew my name. I--\"\r\n\r\nA door opened, and a stream of light fell on the deck some feet away.\r\nSturgess's voice reached them clearly.\r\n\r\n\"Guess she's tucked up cozy in a deck chair,\" he was saying. \"It's no\r\ntime to retire to roost yet, anyhow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Please go now,\" whispered Nina tremulously. \"You mustn't be seen\r\ntalking to me. I--I'll discuss things with Madge, and if possible, come\r\nhere about the same hour to-morrow, or next day. I--I'll do my best.\"\r\n\r\nWithout another word, Maseden swung himself over the rail. When below\r\nthe level of the deck he clung to the ladder and listened, not meaning\r\nto act ungenerously, but because of the other man's rapid approach.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, there you are, Miss Nina!\" cried Sturgess. \"Sister Madge is bored\r\nstiff by my company, but was polite enough to pretend that she was\r\nanxious about you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've been star-gazing,\" said the girl, hastening towards him.\r\n\r\n\"So've I,\" grinned Sturgess. \"You two girls have the finest eyes I've\r\never--\"\r\n\r\nHis voice trailed away into silence. Maseden dropped to the deck.\r\n\r\n\"Hang it all!\" he muttered, strangely disconsolate. \"When Fate took me\r\nby the scruff of the neck and married me to one of two sisters, neither\r\nof whom I had ever seen, she might have been kind enough, the jade, to\r\ntie me to the right one!\"\r\n\r\nYet, even to his thinking, Madge and Nina were like as a couple of pins!\r\nBeing an eminently sensible sort of fellow, he realized in the next\r\nbreath that Madge might be quite as nice a girl as Nina.\r\n\r\nThen the thought struck him that she was purposely making things easier\r\nfor him by cultivating a friendship with Sturgess. In any case, Sturgess\r\nwas obviously destined to act as a pawn in the game. Even he, Maseden,\r\nhad not scrupled to use that gentleman at sight when anxious to board\r\nthe _Southern Cross_ without attracting the attention of the\r\nnews-mongering boatmen of Cartagena.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat night he lay awake for hours. For one thing, the ship was running\r\ninto bad weather again, and complained nosily of the buffeting her stout\r\nframe was receiving. For another, his own course was beset with\r\ndifficulties. He failed completely to understand the attitude of sister\r\nNina.\r\n\r\nIf Madeleine--or Madge, as he had better learned to distinguish her--had\r\nsought marriage with a man about to die as a means to escape from some\r\nunbearable duress, was her plight accentuated rather than bettered by\r\nthe fact that her husband still lived? If so, the announcement that he\r\nmeant to obtain a legal dissolution of the bond at the earliest possible\r\nmoment would relieve the tension.\r\n\r\nBut what if her need demanded that she should remain wed, a wife in\r\nname only? A development of that sort foreshadowed complexities of a\r\nrare order. Maseden knew himself as one capable of Quixotic action--even\r\nthe scheming Steinbaum had paid him _that_ tribute--but it was asking\r\ntoo much that he should go through life burdened with a wife who treated\r\nhim as a benevolent stranger.\r\n\r\nCommon sense urged that they should meet and discuss a most trying and\r\nequivocal situation as frankly and fully as might be. Why, then, had\r\nNina Gray been so disturbed, so anxious to keep the married pair apart?\r\nBoth girls knew he was alive. What purpose could it serve that the fact\r\nshould be ignored?\r\n\r\nHe puzzled his brain to recall incidents he had heard of Steinbaum's\r\nhistory, but investigation along that line drew a blank. Was Suarez\r\nmixed up in the embroglio? It was unlikely. Though the man had spent\r\nsome years in the United States and in Europe, he had not left San Juan\r\nsince he, Maseden, came there, and, before that period, both Madge and\r\nNina Gray must have been girls in short frocks and long tresses.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the father's record would provide a clew. Somehow, though he had\r\nnever set eyes on Mr. Gray save as a shadowy form on a dark night,\r\nMaseden sensed him as unsympathetic. He was forced to form a judgment on\r\nthe flimsiest of material, having none other; but Gray's voice, his way\r\nof speaking to his daughters, had grated.\r\n\r\nFirst impressions are treacherous guides; nevertheless the philosopher\r\nwhom they cannot mislead does not exist.\r\n\r\nThe following day was the longest in Maseden's experience. Monotony, in\r\nitself, is wearying; when, to a dull routine of meals and occasional\r\ntalk with men of an inferior type is added the positive discomfort of\r\nconfinement in the most exposed and cramped part of a ship during a\r\nstiff gale, monotony becomes akin to torture.\r\n\r\nAt last, however, night fell. There was no improvement in the weather,\r\nwhich, if anything, grew worse; but a change in the ship's course, or a\r\nshifting of the wind--no one to whom Maseden might speak could give him\r\nany reliable data on the point--brought the _Southern Cross_ on a more\r\neven keel.\r\n\r\nHere, at least, was some slight compensation for the leaden-footed hours\r\nof waiting. Nina Gray might be a good sailor, but it was hardly\r\nreasonable to expect that she would keep her tryst when the big steamer\r\nwas trying alternately to stand on end or roll bodily over to port.\r\n\r\nAbout nine o'clock Maseden made out a shrouded figure in the position\r\nwhere his \"sister-in-law\" had stood the previous night. He hastened\r\nfrom the shelter of the forecastle, and was promptly drenched from head\r\nto foot by a shower of spray. He was half-way up the ladder when a voice\r\nreached him.\r\n\r\n\"Please go back,\" it said. \"I'll come to the gangway on the starboard\r\nside.\"\r\n\r\nHe regained the deck, made for the right-hand gangway, and soon had the\r\nsatisfaction of seeing the girl walking swiftly along the dimly-lighted\r\ncorridor.\r\n\r\nHe hardly knew how to greet her. To bid her \"Good evening,\" or murmur\r\nsome platitude about her goodness in keeping the appointment in such\r\nvile weather, would have sounded banal.\r\n\r\nThe lady, however, when they came face to face, settled all doubts on\r\nthe question of etiquette by saying breathlessly:\r\n\r\n\"I have had a long talk with my sister, Mr. Maseden, and she bids me\r\ntell you that she cannot meet you herself. You were so generous, so kind\r\nto her, at a moment when your thoughts might well have been centered in\r\nyour own terrible fate, that she cannot bear the ordeal of asking you\r\nthe last favor of forgetting her.\r\n\r\n\"Of course, every facility will be given for the dissolution of the\r\nmarriage. I have written here the address of a firm of lawyers in\r\nPhiladelphia who will act with your legal representatives when the\r\nmatter comes before the courts. For your own purposes, I understand,\r\nyou wish to remain unknown while on board this ship. We have arranged to\r\ntravel to New York by the first American liner sailing from Buenos Ayres\r\nafter our arrival. Perhaps you will be good enough to choose another\r\nvessel, or, if your affairs are urgent, _we_ would wait for a later one.\r\nCan you let me know your wishes now in that matter?\"\r\n\r\nMaseden was so astonished that he literally caught the girl by the\r\nshoulder and turned her partly round so that the light of a distant lamp\r\nfell on her face. The buffeting of the gale, aided, no doubt, by a\r\nfeeling of excitement, had lent her a fine color, but, if her utterance\r\nwas a trifle broken at first, it had soon become calm and measured, nor\r\ndid she seem to resent his cavalier treatment.\r\n\r\n\"Are you joking?\" he said, smiling in sheer perplexity.\r\n\r\n\"I fail to find any humor in my words,\" came the instant reply.\r\n\r\n\"Quite so. They might have been framed by a lawyer. Isn't there a ghost\r\nof a joke in that mere fact?\"\r\n\r\n\"It appeared to my sister, and I fully agree with her, that we are\r\nsuggesting the best way, the only way, out of an embarrassing dilemma.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" agreed Maseden, drawing a long breath. \"I agree to all the\r\nterms; I insist only on priority of sailing from Buenos Ayres. I don't\r\nsee why I should risk my life just to save you a trifling\r\ninconvenience.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then here is the address I spoke of,\" and she proffered an envelope.\r\n\r\n\"Good. We'll leave the rest to the law, Miss Nina.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you. Good-by.\"\r\n\r\nShe would have passed him, but he was on the after side of the gangway,\r\nand his outstretched hand restrained her.\r\n\r\n\"One moment, please,\" he said. \"I want you to tell your sister that she\r\nhas thoroughly--disillusioned me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll do that,\" she assured him, and he could not help but regard her\r\nairy self-possession as the most surprising factor in a remarkable\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n\"And you, too,\" he went on. \"Something has happened to you since last\r\nnight. Somehow you are--harder. Forgive me if I choose unpleasant\r\nadjectives.\"\r\n\r\nShe hesitated before replying. Perhaps she felt the quiet scorn\r\nunderlying the words.\r\n\r\n\"Where my unhappy family is concerned, the forgiveness must come wholly\r\nfrom you,\" she said at last. \"May I go now, Mr. Maseden? Once more,\r\nthank you for all that you have done and will do. Remember, when this\r\nmiserable affair reaches the newspapers, it is not your reputation that\r\nwill suffer, but the woman's!\"\r\n\r\nShe left him gazing blankly after her. There was a tense _vibrato_ in\r\nthe tone of the girl's voice that touched some responsive chord in the\r\nman's breast.\r\n\r\nThen he became aware that he was soaked to the skin, and the wind was\r\npiercingly cold.\r\n\r\nHe murmured a phrase strongly reminiscent of the _Americano_ who took\r\nhunting trips into the interior of Central America, and hurried to his\r\ncabin, where he stripped and rubbed his limbs to a glow before turning\r\nin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nAN UNFORESEEN DISASTER\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the night the storm developed into that elemental chaos which the\r\nlandsman exaggerates into a hurricane and the sailor logs as a strong\r\nnorthwesterly gale. Passage along the open decks of the _Southern Cross_\r\nbecame a hazardous undertaking, an experiment just practicable for a\r\nstrong man clad in oilskins and seaboots, but positively dangerous for\r\none unable to interpret the vagaries of a ship plunging through a heavy\r\nsea. A broken limb or ugly bruise was the certain penalty of an\r\nincautious movement, if, indeed, one was not swept overboard.\r\n\r\nFor a passenger--a non-combatant, so to speak--the only certain way to\r\ninsure physical safety was to lie prone in a bunk, with a hand ever\r\nready to seize the nearest rail when an unusually violent lurch tilted\r\nthe vessel to an angle of forty-five degrees and simultaneously drove\r\nher nose into a veritable mountain of water.\r\n\r\nMaseden contrived to sleep fitfully until a thin gray light, trickling\r\nthrough a tiny port when momentarily free of wave-wash, told him that\r\nanother day had dawned. The din was incessant. Inanimate things may be\r\ninarticulate to human ears, but they speak a language of their own on\r\nsuch occasions--an inchoate tongue made up of banging and clattering, of\r\nstunning vibrations, of wind-shrieks, of the groaning of steel\r\nframework, riveted plates, and seasoned timber.\r\n\r\nThe _Southern Cross_ was tackling her work with stubborn energy, but she\r\ncomplained of its severity in every fibre. Ships, like men, prefer easy\r\nconditions, and growl in their own peculiar manner when compelled to\r\nwage a fierce and continuous fight for mere existence.\r\n\r\nOf course a sailor never permits himself to think of his own craft in\r\nsuch wise. \"Dirty weather\" is simply an unpleasant episode in the\r\nroutine of a voyage. He regards it much as the average city man views\r\nwind and rain--displeasing additions to life's minor worries, but not to\r\nbe considered as affecting the daily task.\r\n\r\nIn a modern, well-found steamship such negative faith is fully\r\njustified, and the ship's company of the _Southern Cross_ went about\r\ntheir several duties as methodically as though the vessel were roped\r\nsecurely alongside a pier in the North River.\r\n\r\nThe center of the forecastle held a roomy compartment in which meals\r\nwere served for the crew, and Maseden took refuge there as soon as he\r\nwas dressed. He obtained an early cup of coffee, and derived some\r\ncomfort from the fact, communicated by the half-caste sailor he had\r\nsaved from the falling pulley, that about the same time next day they\r\nwould sight the Evangelistas light, and soon thereafter be in the\r\nland-locked water of the Straits of Magellan.\r\n\r\nHe realized, of course, that sight or sound of either Madge Gray or her\r\nsister was hardly to be expected during the next twenty-four hours. In\r\nfact, he might not see them again before Buenos Ayres was reached.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, it would be better so, he decided. A thrilling and\r\nmost dramatic incident in a life not otherwise noteworthy for its\r\nvicissitudes would close when he was safe on board a homeward-bound mail\r\nsteamer. After that would come some small experience of a court of law.\r\n\r\nFor the rest, if he contrived to cheat the newspapers of the full\r\ndetails, he would actually risk his repute as a veracious citizen if he\r\ntold the plain truth about one day's history in the Republic of San\r\nJuan.\r\n\r\nOnce, in his teens, when in London during a never-to-be-forgotten\r\nEuropean tour, a friend of his father's pointed out a small, alert man,\r\ndressed in gray tweeds, who was hailing a cab in Pall Mall, and said:\r\n\r\n\"Look, Alec! That is Evans of the Guides. I met him five years ago in\r\nLucknow, and even at that date he had killed his sixty-first tiger on\r\nfoot and alone. He never shoots stripes any other way. He says it isn't\r\nquite sporting to tackle the brute from the comparative safety of a\r\nhowdah or a _machan_--a platform rigged in a tree, you know.\"\r\n\r\nPhilip Alexander Maseden, aged sixteen, neither knew nor cared what a\r\n_machan_ was. His faculties were absorbed in the difficult task of\r\nreconciling a dapper little man in a gray suit, skipping nimbly into a\r\ncab in Pall Mall, with a redoubtable Nimrod who had bagged sixty-one\r\ntigers after tracking them into their jungles.\r\n\r\nAnd that was the record of five years earlier. Perhaps in the meantime\r\nthe bold _shikari_ had added dozens to the total. A mighty hunter,\r\nEvans, but hard to reconcile with his environment.\r\n\r\nSeated in the wet, creaking cabin, and watching through a window which\r\nopened aft the turmoil of seas leaping venomously at and over the stout\r\nbulk of the _Southern Cross_, Maseden thought of Evans of the Guides,\r\nand his cohort of tiger-ghosts. Yet not one tiger among the lot had\r\nbrought Evans so near death as he, Maseden, was when Steinbaum entered\r\nhis cell on that fateful morning, and, in the closest shave Evans was\r\never favored with, a violent end had not been averted by stranger means.\r\n\r\nHow would the story of \"Madeleine,\" Suarez, and Captain Gomez's boots\r\nsound if told in a cosy corner of a Fifth Avenue club?\r\n\r\nBy reason of his position in the fore part of the vessel, Maseden could\r\nsurvey the bridge, chart-house and some part of the promenade deck.\r\nThe head of the officer on watch was visible above the canvas screen\r\nwhich those who go down to the sea in ships have christened the\r\n\"devil-dodger.\" The officer's sou'wester was tied on firmly, and the\r\nplacid expression of the strong, weather-stained face was clearly\r\ndiscernible. For the most part, he looked straight ahead, with an\r\noccasional glance back, or over the side into the spume and froth\r\nchurned up by the ship's passage. Once in a while he would draw away\r\nfrom the screen and compare the course shown by the compass with that\r\nsteered by the quartermaster at the wheel.\r\n\r\nFor lack of something better to occupy his mind, Maseden followed each\r\nmovement of the man on the bridge. Thus, singularly enough, next to the\r\nofficer himself, and possibly a look-out in the bows, he was the first\r\nperson on board to become aware of a peril which suddenly beset the\r\n_Southern Cross_.\r\n\r\nWhat that peril was he could not guess, but he saw that the officer was\r\nshouting instructions to the quartermaster, and in the same instant the\r\nclang of a bell showed that the engine-room telegraph was in use.\r\n\r\nAlmost immediately the ship's speed slackened, and as she yielded to the\r\npressure of wind and wave the clamor of her struggle sank to comparative\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\nA few seconds later the captain appeared on the bridge. He, like the\r\nofficer, gave particular heed to something which lay straight ahead.\r\nEvidently he approved of the action taken by his subordinate, because,\r\nas well as Maseden could judge, he stood beside the telegraph, with a\r\nhand on the lever, but made no further alteration in the ship's speed.\r\n\r\nNaturally Maseden wondered what had happened and watched closely for\r\ndevelopments. In better weather he would have gone outside, but it was\r\npositively dangerous now to stand close to the ship's rail, or, indeed,\r\nremain on any part of the open deck, while the shadow of an attempt on\r\nhis part to climb the forecastle ladder would have evoked a gruff order\r\nto return.\r\n\r\nWithin a minute or less, however, he made out that the _Southern Cross_\r\nwas passing through a quantity of wreckage, mostly rough-hewn timber.\r\nHere and there a spar would unexpectedly thrust its tapering point\r\nhigh above the tawny vortex of the waves; at odd times a portion of a\r\nbulkhead and fragments of white-painted panels would be revealed for\r\nan instant. Some unfortunate sailing ship had been torn to shreds by\r\nthe gale, and the steamer was just passing through that section of the\r\nsea-plain still cumbered by her fragments, though the tragedy itself had\r\nprobably occurred many a mile away from that particular point on the\r\nmap.\r\n\r\nBy this time the stopping of the engines had aroused every member of the\r\ncrew not on watch. Some of the men, bleary-eyed with sleep, gathered in\r\nthe cabin, and their comments were illuminating.\r\n\r\n\"Wind-jammer gone with all hands,\" said one man, after a critical glance\r\nat the flotsam on both sides of the ship.\r\n\r\n\"What for have we slowed up?\" inquired another. \"The old man ain't\r\nthinkin' of lowerin' a boat, is he?\"\r\n\r\n\"Lower a boat, saphead, in a sea like this!\" scoffed the first speaker.\r\n\r\n\"Wouldn't he try to rescue any poor sailor-men who may be clingin' to\r\nthe wreck?\" came the retort.\r\n\r\n\"As though any sort of blisterin' wreck could live in this weather! Try\r\nagain, Jimmy. We're dodgin' planks an' ropes; that's our special stunt\r\njust now. One o' them hefty chunks o' lumber would knock a hole in us\r\nbelow the water-line before you could say 'knife'. An' how about a sail\r\nan' cordage wrappin' themselves lovin'ly around the screw? Where 'ud\r\n_we_ be then?... There you are. What did I tell you?\"\r\n\r\nA heavy thud, altogether different from the blow delivered by a wave,\r\nshook the _Southern Cross_ from stem to stern. The captain looked over\r\nthe port side, and followed the movement of some unseen object until it\r\nwas swept well clear of the ship. The engines, which had been stopped\r\ncompletely, were rung on to \"Slow ahead\" again. They remained at that\r\nspeed for half a minute, not longer. Then they were stopped once more,\r\nand the officer of the watch quitted the bridge hurriedly.\r\n\r\n\"What the devil's the matter _now_?\" growled the more experienced critic\r\nanxiously. \"That punch we got can't of started a plate, or all hands\r\nwould 'a' bin piped on deck!\"\r\n\r\nSingularly enough, he either forgot or was afraid to voice his own\r\nprediction as to a possible alternative. The big foremast which had\r\nstruck the ship's quarter was stout enough, most unluckily, to support a\r\nthin wire rope, and this unseen assailant had fouled the propeller. In\r\nall likelihood, had the captain given the order \"Full speed ahead,\" the\r\nevil thing might have been thrown clear before mischief was done.\r\n\r\nAs it was, the very care with which the _Southern Cross_ was navigated\r\nled to her undoing. With each slow turn of the screw the snake-like rope\r\nwhich was destined to choke the life out of a gallant ship had coiled\r\nitself into a death grip.\r\n\r\nSoon some of the strands were forced between propeller and shaft-casing.\r\nThe solid steel cylinder of the shaft became fixed as in a vise. The\r\nengines were powerless. To apply their force was only to increase the\r\nresistance. They could not be driven either ahead or astern.\r\n\r\nThe _Southern Cross_ promptly fell away to the southeast under the\r\nstress of wind and tide. After her, forming a sort of sea-anchor,\r\nlolloped the derelict foremast which, by its buoyancy, was the first\r\ncause of all the mischief.\r\n\r\nMostly it was towed astern. Sometimes a giant wave would snatch it up\r\nand drive it like a battering ram against the ship's counter.\r\n\r\nThese blows were generally harmless, the rounded butt of the spar\r\nglancing off from the acute angle presented by the molded stern-plates.\r\nOnce or twice, however, the rudder was struck squarely, so the chief\r\nofficer, aided by some of the men, quickly put an end to the capacity\r\nof this novel battering-ram for inflating further damage by lassoing\r\nand hauling aboard the whole mass of wreckage--mast, yards and tattered\r\nsails alike.\r\n\r\nThen a gruesome discovery was made. Tied to the mast was the corpse\r\nof a man, but so bruised and battered as to be wholly unrecognizable.\r\nThe poor body, nearly naked, and maimed and torn almost out of human\r\nsemblance, was stitched in a strip of wet canvas, weighted with a few\r\nfurnace bars, and committed to the deep again without a moment's loss\r\nof time.\r\n\r\nBut its brief presence had not been helpful. Singularly enough, sailors\r\nare not only fatalists, which they may well be, but superstitious. No\r\nman voiced his sentiments; nevertheless, each felt in his heart the ship\r\nwas doomed.\r\n\r\nCollectively, they would try to save the ship. As individuals, the\r\nparamount question now was--how and when might they endeavor to save\r\ntheir own lives?\r\n\r\nOf course there was neither any sign of panic nor shirking of orders.\r\nThe ship was stanch and eminently seaworthy. She was actually far more\r\ncomfortable while drifting thus helplessly before the gale than when\r\nbattling through it.\r\n\r\nYet every sailor on board, from the captain down to the scullery-man,\r\nknew that some forty miles ahead lay a shore so forbidding and\r\ninhospitable that the United States government charts--than which there\r\nare none so detailed and up-to-date--give navigators the significant\r\nwarning to keep well out to sea, as the coast-line has not been surveyed\r\nin detail.\r\n\r\nYet the case was not immediately desperate. Forty miles of sea-room was\r\nbetter than none. If the gale abated, and an anchor was dropped, it was\r\nprobable that the engineers' cold chisels would soon cut away the wire\r\noctopus.\r\n\r\nMoreover, there was a chance that some other steamer might pick them up\r\nand earn a magnificent salvage by a tow to Punta Arenas.\r\n\r\nSo after breakfast the uncanny harbinger of disaster provided by the\r\nbody of the drowned sailor was, if not forgotten, at least generally\r\nignored. Pipes were lighted. Men not otherwise occupied gathered in\r\ngroups, while every eye strove to pierce the gray haze of the spindrift\r\nwhipped off the waves by each furious gust, each hoping to be the first\r\nto discover the friendly smoke-pall of a passing ship.\r\n\r\nCertain ominous preparations were made, however. Boats were cleared of\r\ntheir wrappings and stocked with water and provisions. Life-belts were\r\nexamined, and their straps adjusted.\r\n\r\nAs the day wore, and noon was reached, the chance of encountering\r\nanother ship became increasingly remote. Sea and wind showed no signs of\r\nfalling. Indeed, a slight rise in the barometer was not an encouraging\r\ntoken. \"First rise after low foretells stronger blow\" is as true to-day\r\nas when Admiral Fitzroy wrote his weather-lore doggerel, and the\r\nprinciples of meteorology hold good equally north and south of the\r\nequator.\r\n\r\nFor a time the captain tried to steady the ship with the canvas\r\nfore-and-aft sails which big steamships use occasionally in fine weather\r\nto help the rudder. This devise certainly got the _Southern Cross_ under\r\ncontrol again, and the crew were vastly astonished when bid furl the\r\nsails after half an hour.\r\n\r\nSurprise ceased when some of them got an opportunity to squint into a\r\ncompass. The wind had veered from northwest to a point south of west.\r\n\r\nOnly a miracle could save the ship now. It seemed as though the very\r\nforces of nature had conspired to bring about her undoing.\r\n\r\nFrom that moment a gloom fell on the little community. Men muttered\r\nbrief words, or chatted in whispers. A few paid furtive visits to their\r\nbunks, and rummaged in kit-bags for some treasured curio or personal\r\nbelonging which could be stowed away in a pocket. It was not a question\r\nnow as to whether the _Southern Cross_ would survive, but when and\r\nwhere she would strike, and what sort of fighting chance would be given\r\nof reaching a bleak shore alive.\r\n\r\nEvery one knew that it would be the wildest folly to lower a boat in\r\nsuch a heavy sea. The sole remaining hope was that the ship would escape\r\nthe outer fringe of reefs, and drive into some rock-bound creek where\r\nthe boats might live.\r\n\r\nBy means of a properly constructed sea-anchor the captain kept the\r\nvessel's head toward the east. Thus, when land was sighted, if any\r\nsemblance of a channel offered, it might be possible to steer in that\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nMen were told off to be in readiness to hoist the sails again at a\r\nmoment's notice. The anchors were cleared, both fore and aft. Nothing\r\nelse could be done but watch and wait, while the great ship rolled into\r\nyawning gulfs or slid down huge curves of yellow-gray water, rolled and\r\nslid ever onward to sure destruction.\r\n\r\nDuring those weary hours, so slow in passing, so swift in succession\r\nwhen sped, Maseden had not once set eyes on his wife or her sister. He\r\nhad seen Sturgess talking to the captain and first officer, but neither\r\nof the ladies appeared on deck.\r\n\r\nStill it was an easy thing to imagine just what was going on. The two\r\nwomen were the only persons on board left in ignorance of the certain\r\nfate awaiting the _Southern Cross_. They were told the half truth that\r\nthe engines were disabled, but that the vessel was in no immediate\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\nIt was better so. Of what avail to frighten them needlessly? The ship\r\nwould have been absolutely safe if the gale blew from the east instead\r\nof the west. Even now she might survive. Her chances were of the\r\nslenderest nature, but there would be ample time to get the women\r\ninto an upper deck saloon or the chart-room when the position became\r\ndesperate. Why embitter the few hours of life yet remaining by knowledge\r\nof the dreadful fate which threatened when the end came?\r\n\r\nAbout two o'clock an undulating blur on the eastern horizon told of\r\nland. To the best of the captain's judgment the _Southern Cross_ was off\r\nHanover Island when the accident happened, and her relative longitude\r\nhad altered but very slightly during the forty-mile drift. It was now or\r\nnever if anything was to be done to save her.\r\n\r\nThe forbidding and mountainous coast-line straight ahead was broken up\r\nby all manner of deep-water channels, each giving access, by devious\r\nways, to the sheltered Smyth's Channel; but so barricaded by sunken\r\nreefs and steep islets as to present almost insuperable obstacles to\r\nthe free passage of a large vessel.\r\n\r\nSmall whalers and guano-boats would not dare any of these straits in\r\nfine weather. For the _Southern Cross_ to make the attempt, even\r\nprovided she ran the gantlet of the barrier reef, was indeed the\r\nforlornest of forlorn hopes.\r\n\r\nThe chief engineer had already assured the captain many times that any\r\nfurther pressure by the engines would inflict irreparable damage, so,\r\nrisking everything on the throw of the dice and wishful to know the\r\nworst, at any rate, before daylight vanished, he ordered the sails to\r\nbe hoisted again.\r\n\r\nAll hands were brought on deck, life-belts were adjusted, and boats'\r\ncrews stood by. At that moment Maseden caught a glimpse of the two\r\ngirls. They, with other passengers, were summoned by the ship's officers\r\nand placed in the smoke-room, which, by reason of its situation beneath\r\nthe bridge, provided a convenient gathering ground in case the boats\r\nwere lowered.\r\n\r\nHe saw them only for a moment--two cloaked figures, wearing cloth caps\r\ntied tightly to their heads with motor-veils. He could not distinguish\r\nMadge from Nina.\r\n\r\nIt was a strange and most bizarre notion that when the gates of eternity\r\nwere opening a second time before his eyes the woman who was his lawful\r\nwife should now be sharing his peril, yet be separated from him far\r\nmore effectually than in the Castle of San Juan.\r\n\r\nThe incongruity of their position did not trouble him greatly, however.\r\nSoon he ceased thinking about it. He realized that he, as an individual,\r\ncould do nothing but obey orders and abide by the decree of Providence.\r\n\r\nHe was not frightened. Some hours earlier, knowing the physical features\r\nof the western coast of South America, he had decided that the odds were\r\na thousand to one against the escape of the ship and her seventy-four\r\noccupants. He hoped that when the end came it might not be a long\r\ndrawn-out agony--that was all. For the rest, he looked forward with a\r\ncertain spice of curiosity to the fight which captain and crew would\r\nmake against the giant forces of nature.\r\n\r\nAn awesome panorama of mighty cliffs, inaccessible islands and isolated\r\nrocks over which the seas dashed with extraordinary fury, was opening up\r\nwith ever-increasing clearness. A mist of driven froth and spindrift\r\nhung low over the surface of the water, but the great hills of the\r\ninterior were distinctly visible.\r\n\r\nIrregular white patches near their summits marked the presence of huge\r\nglaciers. Lower down the valleys were choked with black masses of firs.\r\nCountless generations of trees had grown, and fallen, and rotted,\r\nultimately forming a new, if unstable, basis for more recent growths.\r\n\r\nAn occasional red scar down a hillside revealed the latest landslide. A\r\ncascade would leap out from the topmost part of a forest and bury itself\r\nagain in the depths.\r\n\r\nThese outstanding features were all on a huge scale. It was a weird,\r\nmonstrous land, a place utterly unfitted for human habitation, a part of\r\ncreation quite out of keeping with the rest of the world. Surveying it\r\nimpartially, one might wonder whether it had traveled far in advance of\r\nthe general scheme of things or lagged millions of years behind.\r\n\r\nBut its aspect was sinister and forbidding in the extreme, and never\r\nhave its depressing characteristics been etched in darker shadows than\r\nwhen viewed that January day from the decks of the ill-fated _Southern\r\nCross_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE WRECK\r\n\r\n\r\nUp to the last the ship's path was dogged by misfortune. She approached\r\nHanover Island at a point where the sea was comparatively open; hence,\r\nthe tremendous waves rolling in from the Pacific were not only unchecked\r\nby island breakwaters, but their volume and force were actually\r\nincreased by the gradual upward trend of the rock floor.\r\n\r\nStill, undaunted by conditions which suggested the plight of a doomed\r\ncraft being hurried to the lip of a cataract, keen eyes searched the\r\nfrowning coast-line for one of the many estuaries which pierced the\r\nland, some merely the mouths of short-lived rivers, others again\r\ncarrying the ocean currents to the very base of the Andes.\r\n\r\nAt last an opening did seem to present itself. The great rock walls,\r\nspringing sheer from sea level to a height of a thousand feet or more,\r\nfell apart, and, so far as might be judged, a wide and deep channel\r\nflowed inland.\r\n\r\nIt was at this crisis, when life or death for all on board might depend\r\non the veriest trifle, that the captain had to decide whether or not to\r\nlet go both anchors and endeavor to ride out the gale.\r\n\r\nHe was an experienced and cool-headed sailor. He knew quite well that\r\nthe odds were heavy against an anchor holding in such ground, or, if it\r\nheld, against any cable standing the strain of a six-thousand-ton ship\r\nin that terrific sea. But, as Maseden learned subsequently, he sought\r\nadvice.\r\n\r\nThe first and second officers were consulted in turn, and each confirmed\r\ntheir chief's opinion that the only practicable course was to run into\r\nthe passage which still offered a comparatively clear way ahead.\r\n\r\nSo the _Southern Cross_ sped on.\r\n\r\nThe second officer came forward with some of the crew to superintend the\r\ndropping of the anchor. The fourth officer took charge of the aft\r\nanchor. All other members of the crew stood by the boats.\r\n\r\nMaseden, feeling oddly remote and unclassed among men of his own race,\r\nfollowed the second officer to the forecastle deck. There, at least, he\r\ncould stare his fill at the inferno of rock and broken water which the\r\nvessel was approaching, though even his landsman's eyes saw that she was\r\nin a waterway of considerable width, while each mile now traversed must\r\ntend to diminish the seas and bring a secure anchorage within the bounds\r\nof possibility.\r\n\r\nNo one paid heed to him. Among these stolid sailor-men he was a \"Dago,\"\r\na somewhat dandified specimen of the swaggering _vaqueros_ they had met\r\nat times in the drinking dens of South American ports. He was minded to\r\nhave speech with the second officer, and proclaim once and for all that\r\nhe was of the same kith and kin; but the impulse was stayed by a glance\r\nat the set, resolute face, intent only on obeying a signal from the\r\ncaptain. It was no time for confidences. He questioned even if the\r\nsailor would have answered.\r\n\r\nA touch on a lever would set a winch spinning as the anchor leaped to\r\nits task. The man charged with carrying out that duty without hitch or\r\ndelay could spare thought for nothing else.\r\n\r\nOne of the deck-hands, stationed near the chocks, chanced to be the very\r\nSpaniard whose life had been endangered by the falling block on the day\r\nafter the ship left Cartagena. The ship's carpenter was ill, and the\r\nSpaniard was carpenter's mate.\r\n\r\nMaseden caught his eye, and the man smiled wanly.\r\n\r\n\"You did me a good turn the other day, senor,\" he said. \"Let me repay\r\nyou now.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how?\" came the surprised inquiry.\r\n\r\n\"Underneath my bunk, the lowest one on the left in number seven berth,\r\nyou will find my kit-bag. Beneath some clothes is a bottle of good old\r\nbrandy. Get it, and drink it quickly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"You will put a pint of honest liquor to good use, and in ten minutes\r\nyou won't care what happens.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have no desire to die drunk,\" said Maseden quietly.\r\n\r\nThe Spaniard shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"You'll never have a better excuse for swallowing excellent cognac,\" he\r\ngrinned.\r\n\r\n\"Shut up, you two!\" growled the officer.\r\n\r\nHe had not understood a word of their talk. He simply voiced the\r\neminently American notion that anything said in the Spanish language\r\ncould not be of the least importance just then.\r\n\r\nOddly enough, Maseden was angered by being thus outcasted, as it were.\r\nHe was tempted to retort, but happily checked the words on his lips.\r\nNerves were apt to be on a raw edge in such conditions, he remembered.\r\nEven the stern-faced ship's officer, awaiting a command which would\r\nsettle the fate of the _Southern Cross_ once and for all, might well\r\nresent the magpie chattering of a couple of Spaniards.\r\n\r\nMaseden turned for an instant to look at the bridge. The captain stood\r\nthere, apparently the most unmoved person on board. The sails, tugging\r\nfiercely at their rings and bolts, still kept the ship under control,\r\nnotwithstanding the ten-knot tidal current which carried her onward\r\nirresistibly. The foresail was bellied out to port, so the captain\r\nremained on the starboard side of the bridge, whence he had an\r\nuninterrupted view ahead.\r\n\r\nSuddenly two cloaked figures emerged from the obscurity of the\r\nsmoking-room and hurried to the transverse rail which guarded the fore\r\npart of the promenade deck. With them came some men, among whom Maseden\r\nrecognized Sturgess; while another man, who caught the arm of one of the\r\ngirls in a helpless sort of way, was probably Mr. Gray.\r\n\r\nEvidently there was no concealing the ship's peril from the passengers\r\nnow. Everyone wore a life-belt, and was clothed to resist the cold. A\r\nplausible explanation of this general flocking out on to the deck was\r\nthat they had discerned the cleft in the rocky heights through a blurred\r\nwindow, and refused to remain any longer in the sheltered uncertainty of\r\nthe smoking-room.\r\n\r\nAt this period there was little or no difficulty in keeping one's feet.\r\nThe great hull of the _Southern Cross_ swung easily on an even keel with\r\nthe onrush of the sea-river. The ship was not fighting now, but\r\nyielding--a complacent leviathan held captive by a most puissant and\r\nruthless enemy.\r\n\r\nDuring the few seconds Maseden stared at the veiled women. One of those\r\ntwo--which one he could not tell--was his wife. It was the maddest, most\r\nfantastic thing he had ever heard of. In a spirit of sheer deviltry he\r\nwaved a greeting. One of the girls raised a hand to her face--perhaps to\r\nher lips.\r\n\r\nWhat did it matter? In all human probability that was their eternal\r\nfarewell. He waved again, and turned resolutely to scan the frowning\r\nheadlands now rapidly closing in on both sides of the vessel's path.\r\n\r\nAbout that time a new and disturbing sound reached his ears. Hitherto\r\nthere had been nothing but the unceasing chant of the gale, the thud and\r\nswish of the seas, the steady plaint of the ship, and an occasional\r\ncrash like a volley of musketry when the crest was torn off some giant\r\nroller and flung against poop or superstructure. But now there came a\r\ncrashing, booming noise, irregular, yet almost continuous, and ever\r\ngrowing louder and more insistent; a noise almost exactly similar to\r\ndistant gun-fire and the snarling explosions of heavy projectiles.\r\n\r\nIt was the noise of the bitterest and longest war ever waged. Those old\r\nenemies, sea and land, were engaged in deadly combat, and, as ever, the\r\nsea was winning.\r\n\r\nEven while the _Southern Cross_ swung past an overhanging fortress of\r\nrock, a mighty bastion crumbled into ruin. It was singular to watch a\r\ncloud of dust mingle with the spindrift--to note how the next breaker\r\nclimbed higher in assault over the vantage ground provided by the\r\nsuccessful sap.\r\n\r\nA disconcerting feature of the ship's hurried transit into this\r\nunchartered territory was the clearness with which all things were\r\nvisible above a height of some twelve feet from the surface of the sea;\r\nwhereas, below that level, the clouds of spray and flying scud formed an\r\nalmost impenetrable wall.\r\n\r\nTaking his eyes from the everchanging panorama, Maseden looked over the\r\nside. The foam-flecked water was black but fairly transparent. In its\r\ndepths he was astounded by the sight of writhing, sinister shapes like\r\nthe arms of innumerable devil-fish.\r\n\r\nAt first he experienced a shock of surprise so close akin to horror that\r\nhe felt the chill of it, as though one of these fearsome tentacles were\r\nalready twined around his shrinking body. Then he realized that he had\r\nbeen startled by some gigantic species of seaweed. The ship was crossing\r\na submarine forest. Down there in the depths on this January day in the\r\nsouthern hemisphere some mysterious form of plant life was enjoying its\r\nleafy June.\r\n\r\nBut science had no joys for him in that hour. Better the outlook on crag\r\nand clearing sky than a furtive glimpse of the limbs and foliage of\r\nthat monstrous growth.\r\n\r\nAll at once a cry from the look-out in the bows sent a quiver through\r\nevery hearer.\r\n\r\n\"Rock ahead!\"\r\n\r\nAfter a pause, measured by seconds, but seeming like as many minutes,\r\nthe same voice shouted:\r\n\r\n\"Channel opens to starboard!\"\r\n\r\nThe ship answered the helm. She swept past a jagged little islet so\r\nclosely that a sailor could have cast a coil of rope ashore.\r\n\r\nForthwith another sound mingled with the crash of the breakers. The rock\r\nhad been bored right through by the waves, and the gale set up a note in\r\nthe tunnel such as no organ-builder ever dreamed of.\r\n\r\nThat mighty chord pursued the _Southern Cross_ for nearly half a mile.\r\nIt was a melancholy and depressing wail. Maseden, whose faculties were\r\nsupernaturally alert, noticed that the South American sailor's face had\r\nturned a sickly green. The man was paralyzed with fright. His right hand\r\nfumbled in a weak attempt to cross himself.\r\n\r\nOut of the tail of his eye the second officer caught the gesture.\r\n\r\n\"Pull yourself together, you swab!\" he said bitingly. \"What the hell\r\ngood will you be if you give way like that?\"\r\n\r\nThe Spaniard grasped the sense of command in the words rather than their\r\nmeaning. He was no coward. He even contrived to grin. It was a tonic to\r\nbe cursed by an American, even though the pierced rock howled like a\r\nlost soul!\r\n\r\nStill the _Southern Cross_ drove on. The tidal stream was, if anything,\r\nswifter than ever, but the size of the waves had diminished sensibly.\r\nThe walls of the straits had closed in to within a half-mile span. There\r\ncould not be the slightest doubt that the vessel was actually passing\r\nthrough one of the waterways which connect the Pacific with Smyth's\r\nChannel.\r\n\r\nMaseden, after scanning the interior highlands for the hundredth time,\r\nglanced again at the second officer. The grimness of the clean-cut,\r\nstern face had somewhat relaxed. Quite unconsciously the sailor's\r\nexpression showed that hope had replaced calm-visaged despair. Given an\r\nunhindered run of another mile, the ship could at least drop anchor with\r\nsome prospect of success.\r\n\r\nThe strength of the tide would diminish in less than an hour, and it\r\nmight be possible to maneuver in the slack water for a comparatively\r\nsafe berth. Next day, if the weather moderated as promised by the\r\nbarometer, the steam pinnace could spy out the land in front.\r\n\r\nSmyth's Channel was not so far away--perhaps fifty miles. Once there,\r\nthe _Southern Cross_ could repair damage and proceed under her own steam\r\nto Punta Arenas.\r\n\r\nA gleam of yellow light irradiated the surface mist, which had grown\r\nmarkedly denser. The clouds were parting, and the sun was vouchsafing\r\nsome thin rays from the northwest.\r\n\r\nThe mere sight was cheering. The blood ran warmer in the veins. It was\r\nas though the ship's company, after days and nights of cold and\r\nstarvation, had been miraculously supplied with food and hot liquids.\r\n\r\nThen the golden radiance died away, and simultaneously came the cry:\r\n\r\n\"Reef ahead!\"\r\n\r\nThere was no need for further warning by the men in the bows. The\r\n_Southern Cross_ had hardly traveled her own length before every person\r\nin the fore part of the ship, together with the occupants of bridge and\r\npromenade deck, became aware that a seemingly impassable barrier lay\r\nright across the channel. At the same time the line of cliffs fell away\r\nto the southward.\r\n\r\nBeyond the reef, then, lay a wide stretch of land-locked water; its\r\nunexpected existence explained the frantic haste of the tidal current.\r\nIt was cruel luck that nature should have thrown one of her defensive\r\nworks across that bottle-neck entrance. A few cables' lengths away was\r\nsafety; here, unavoidable--sullen and rigid as death himself--were the\r\nrock fangs.\r\n\r\nAt the supreme moment the second officer never turned his head. His eyes\r\nwere riveted on the motionless figure standing on the starboard side of\r\nthe bridge.\r\n\r\nThe captain raised his hand; the sails flapped loudly in the wind; both\r\nanchors splashed overboard with hoarse rattling of chains. The after\r\nanchor failed, but the forward one held at a depth of ten fathoms.\r\n\r\nThe second officer was quick to note the sudden strain, and eased\r\nit--once, twice, three times. But it was now or never. The ship was\r\nswinging in the stream, and her stern-post would just clear the fringe\r\nof the reef if the anchor made good its grip.\r\n\r\nThe _Southern Cross_ had gone round, with a heavy lurch to port, caused\r\nby the tremendous pressure of wind and wave, and was almost stationary\r\nwhen the cable parted. The thick chain flew back with all the impetus of\r\nsix thousand tons in motion behind it.\r\n\r\nMissing Maseden by a hair's breadth, it struck the foretop, and the spar\r\nsnapped like a carrot. It fell forward, and the identical block which\r\nhad nearly brought about the death of the South American sailor now\r\ncaught his rescuer on the side of the head.\r\n\r\nIn the same instant a heavy stay dragged Maseden bodily over the\r\nfore-rail and he pitched headlong to the deck, where, however, the\r\nactual fall was broken by the stout canvas of the sail.\r\n\r\nA woman screamed, but he could not hear, being knocked insensible.\r\n\r\n\"All hands amidships!\" shouted the captain, and there was a race for the\r\nladders. One man, however, the Spaniard, stooped over the young\r\nAmerican's body. His eyes were streaming with tears.\r\n\r\n\"Good-by, friend!\" he sobbed. \"Maybe this is a better way than that\r\nopened by my bottle of brandy!\"\r\n\r\nHe was sure that the _vaquero_ who swore like an _Americano_ had been\r\nkilled, because blood was flowing freely from a scalp wound; but he\r\nlifted Maseden's inert form, and, without any valid reason behind the\r\naction, placed him in his bunk, as the cabin door stood open.\r\n\r\nThen he ran after the others.\r\n\r\nPoor fellow! He little dreamed that he was repaying a thousand-fold the\r\nfew extra days of life the good-looking _vaquero_ had given him.\r\n\r\nAlmost immediately the ship struck. There was a fearsome crash of\r\nrending plates and torn ribs, the great vessel reeled over, struck again\r\nand bumped clear of the outer reef.\r\n\r\nNow, too late, the after anchor lodged in a sunken crevice; the cable\r\ndid not yield, because the vessel was sucked into a sort of backwash and\r\ndriven, bow on, close to an apparently unscalable cliff.\r\n\r\nShe settled rapidly. As it happened a submerged rock smashed her\r\nkeel-plate beneath the engine-room, and the engines, together with the\r\nstout framework to which the superstructure was bolted amidships, became\r\nanchored there, offering a new obstacle to the onward race of the seas\r\npouring over the reef.\r\n\r\nEvery boat was either smashed instantaneously or wrenched bodily from\r\nits davits. Two-thirds of the hull fell away almost at once, the\r\nforecastle tilting towards the cliff, and the poop being swept into deep\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nWith the after part went at least half the ship's company, their last\r\ncries of despair being smothered by the continuous roar of the wind and\r\nthe thunder of the waves. The bridge, with the rooms immediately below,\r\nremained fairly upright, but the smoking-room, and officers' quarters\r\nclose to it, were swept by water breast high.\r\n\r\nSome one--who it was will never be known--had ordered the passengers to\r\nrun into the smoking-room when the forward cable parted. Now, with the\r\nmagnificent courage invariably shown by American sailors even when the\r\ngates of death gape wide before their eyes, the first and second\r\nofficers contrived to hoist the two girls to the chart-room behind the\r\nbridge.\r\n\r\nSturgess, behaving with great gallantry, helped the women first, and\r\nthen their father, who was floating in the room, to reach the only\r\navailable gangway. Others followed, but the difficulty of rescue--if\r\nsuch a sorrowful transition might be called a rescue--was enhanced by\r\nthe noise and sudden darkness.\r\n\r\nEver the central citadel of the _Southern Cross_ was sinking lower. Ever\r\nthe leaping waves and their clouds of spray tended more and more to shut\r\nout the light.\r\n\r\nSeven people were plucked from immediate death in this fashion. All\r\ntold, officers, crew and passengers, the survivors of seventy-four souls\r\nnumbered twelve.\r\n\r\nThere was a thirteenth, because Maseden was lying high and dry in his\r\nbunk. But of him they took no count.\r\n\r\nThey gathered in the chart-room. Those who still retained their senses\r\ntried to revive the more fortunate ones to whom was vouchsafed a\r\nmerciful oblivion of their common plight. Even in the temporary haven of\r\nthe chart-room the conditions quickly savored of utter misery. The\r\nwindows were blown away. The doors were jammed open by the warping of\r\nthe deck. Wind, waves and sheets of spray seemed to vie with demoniac\r\nenergy as to which could be most cruel and deadly. The ceaseless\r\nwarping and working of what was left of the ship presaged complete\r\ncollapse at any moment, and the din of the reef was stupefying.\r\n\r\nStill, the captain did not abate one jot of his cool demeanor. He eyed\r\nthe sea, the rocks, the remains of his ship and the beetling crags from\r\nwhich he was cut off by sixty feet of raging water.\r\n\r\nThen he deliberately turned his back on it all. Going to a locker, he\r\nproduced a screwdriver and began methodically drawing the screws of the\r\ndoor-hinges.\r\n\r\nThe chief officer thought that the other man's brain had yielded to the\r\nstress.\r\n\r\n\"What are you doing, sir?\" he said, placing a hand gently on his\r\nfriend's shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"We haven't a ten-million to one chance of remaining here till the gale\r\ngives out,\" was the calm answer, \"but we may as well rig up some sort of\r\nprotection from the weather. There are four lockers and four doors.\r\nLet's block up those broken windows as well as we can.\"\r\n\r\nA curiously admiring light shone in the chief officer's eyes. He said\r\nnothing, but helped. Soon a corner was completely walled. They decided\r\nit was better to have one section thoroughly shielded than the whole\r\nonly partially.\r\n\r\nThey made a quick job of it. The girls, Mr. Gray, and two men recovering\r\nconsciousness were allotted to the angle.\r\n\r\nThen the captain opened one of the three bottles of claret stored in a\r\nlocker, and portioned out the contents among the survivors.\r\n\r\nThere was no need to measure the share of a heavily-built Spaniard who\r\nwas reputed to be a wealthy rancher from the Argentine. His spine was\r\nbroken when the ship lurched over the reef. He was found dead when they\r\ntried to move him to the sheltered corner.\r\n\r\nAnd now a pall of darkness spread swiftly over the face of the waters.\r\nThe tide fell, but the ship sank with it. She no longer rocked and shook\r\nunder the blows of the waves. It seemed as though she knew herself\r\ncrippled beyond all hope of succor, and only awaited another tide to\r\nmeet annihilation.\r\n\r\nWind and sea were more furious than ever. In all likelihood, the gale\r\nwould blow itself out next day. But long before dawn the rising tide\r\nwould have made short work of what was left of the _Southern Cross_.\r\n\r\nNever was a small company of Christian people in a more hopeless\r\nposition. Every boat was gone. They had no food. They were wet to the\r\nskin, and pierced with bitter cold. Even the hardy captain's teeth\r\nchattered as he took a pipe from his pocket, rolled some tobacco between\r\nthe palms of his hands, and said smilingly to those near him:\r\n\r\n\"This is one of the occasions when a water-tight pipe-lighter is a real\r\ntreasure. Who'd like a smoke? You must find your own pipes. I can supply\r\nsome 'baccy and a light!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nONE CHANCE IN A MILLION\r\n\r\n\r\nMaseden was badly hurt and quite stunned. Of that there could be no\r\nmanner of doubt. He was blissfully unaware of the destruction of the\r\nship, and did not regain his senses until long after the captain and\r\nsome few of the men gathered in the dismantled chart-room had indulged\r\nin what was to prove their last pipeful of tobacco.\r\n\r\nEven when a species of ordered perception was restored he was wholly\r\nunable during an hour or more to collect his wits sufficiently to\r\nunderstand just what had happened.\r\n\r\nCertain phenomena were vaguely disturbing; that was all. He knew, for\r\ninstance, that the _Southern Cross_ was wrecked, because the deck was\r\ntilted permanently at an alarming angle. As the downward slope was\r\nforward, however, and his bunk lay across it and on the forward side of\r\nthe door the physical outcome was by no means unpleasant, since his body\r\nwas wedged comfortably between the mattress and the bulkhead.\r\n\r\nHe was dry and warm. The weather-proof garments of the pampas were\r\nadmirably adapted to resist exposure, while the pitch of the deck, aided\r\nby the conformation of the bows, diminished the striking power of the\r\nwaves and carried the spray and broken water clean over the remains of\r\nthe forecastle.\r\n\r\nMaseden's position resembled that of a man ensconced in a dry niche of a\r\ncave behind a waterfall. So long as he did not move and the cavern held\r\nintact he was safe and comfortable. Happily, a long time elapsed between\r\nthe first glimmer of consciousness and the moment when the knowledge was\r\nborne in on him that he was actually beset by immediate and most deadly\r\nperil.\r\n\r\nHe imagined that the ship had been cast ashore after he met with some\r\nrather serious accident, that some kind Samaritan had tucked him into\r\nhis own berth, and that, in due course, some one would look in on him\r\nwith a cheery inquiry as to how he was faring. His answer would have\r\nbeen that his head ached abominably, that his mouth and throat were on\r\nfire, and that a long drink of cold water was the one thing needed to\r\nsend him to sleep and speedy recovery.\r\n\r\nHe did not realize that when he dropped face downward into the folds of\r\nthe sail he had swallowed a quantity of salt water lodged there\r\ninstantly by the pelting seas. It was not until he moved, and yielded\r\nto a fit of vomiting, which relieved the pain in his head and cleared\r\nhis faculties, that the dreadful truth began to dawn in his mind.\r\n\r\nOnce, however, the process of clear reasoning set in, it developed\r\nrapidly. He noticed, in the first instance, that the angle of the deck\r\nwas becoming steeper. It was strange, he thought, that although the\r\nlight was failing, no one came near. His ears, too, told him that seas\r\nwere still hammering furiously on every side.\r\n\r\nFinally, a marked movement of the forecastle as it slipped over a smooth\r\nrock race, owing to the increase of dead weight brought about by the\r\nfalling tide, induced a species of alarmed curiosity which proved a most\r\npotent tonic. At one moment feeling hardly able to move, the next he was\r\nscrambling out of the bunk and climbing crab-like through the doorway.\r\n\r\nThen he saw that the forecastle deck had been torn away in line with the\r\nforward bulkhead of the fore hold. With some difficulty, being still\r\nphysically weak and shaken, he raised head and shoulders above this\r\njagged edge and peered over.\r\n\r\nThen he understood. The ship was in pieces on the reef. Two bits of her\r\nstill remained; the forecastle, a stubborn wedge nearly always the last\r\npart of a steel-built vessel to collapse, and the bridge, with its\r\nbacking of the chart house. All else had gone--the funnels had fallen\r\nan hour earlier.\r\n\r\nEven the steel plates and stout wood work of the superstructure had\r\nmelted away from the six strong ribs to which the sunken engines were\r\nbolted, leaving the bridge and chart house in air.\r\n\r\nAlready, too, one of the six pillars which had proved the salvation of\r\nthat forlorn aerie had yielded to the strain and snapped. In the\r\nhalf-light it was difficult to discern just what support was given to\r\nthe squat rectangle of the chart-house; Maseden had to look long and\r\nsteadily through the flying scud before he gathered the exact facts.\r\n\r\nThe upper deck of the forecastle shut off any glimpse of the cliffs. All\r\nhe could see was the reef, much more visible now, but still partially\r\nsubmerged by every sea; beyond it, a howling wilderness of broken water,\r\nand in the midst of this depressing picture, the ghost-like chart-house\r\nand bridge.\r\n\r\nBut he recalled vividly enough the sight of an awesome precipice close\r\nat hand before something had hit him and robbed him of senses. If the\r\nship, or what was left of her, was lodged on the reef towards which she\r\nwas being driven at the time of his mishap, the shore could not be far\r\ndistant.\r\n\r\nWithin a foot of where he lay on the deck, clinging to it as a man\r\nmight save himself from falling off the steeply-pitched roof of a house,\r\nwas the big bole of the foremast, on which the rings of the sails formed\r\na sort of ladder. He pulled himself up, stretched his body along the\r\nmast in the opposite direction, and made out the uneven summit of the\r\ncliff above the straight line of the upper deck.\r\n\r\nHe was exposed to the weather here, but the waves were not breaking\r\nacross the forecastle now, and the spray and biting wind tended\r\nrather to dissipate the feeling of lassitude which had proved quite\r\noverpowering while he remained in the bunk. He raised himself cautiously\r\nanother foot or so, and the rugged wall of the precipice loomed so close\r\nthat at first he fancied the wreck was touching it.\r\n\r\nThe broken topmast, however, swaying in the wind, and still held to its\r\nmore solid support by a couple of wire stays, pointed drunkenly at the\r\ncliff, and the pulley dangling from it was occasionally dashed by the\r\ngale against an overhanging ledge.\r\n\r\nEven while Maseden was arriving at a pretty accurate estimate of the way\r\nin which he had been injured--because he now recalled the parting of\r\nthe anchor cable--the forecastle moved again, the wet and frowning wall\r\nbecame even more visible, and although an awesome gap intervened, the\r\nswaying, pointed spar seemed to offer a fantastic glimpse of a means of\r\nescape.\r\n\r\nAs yet, the truck, or top of the mast, was fully sixteen feet distant\r\nfrom the face of the cliff. But it had been twenty feet or more distant\r\na moment ago, and that last movement of the hull had lessened the width\r\nof the chasm.\r\n\r\nWhat if the spar jammed? Could a man obtain foothold on that slimy rock\r\nsurface?\r\n\r\nHe thought it possible. A deep crevice seemed to promise some vague\r\nprospect of upward progress to one who could climb, and to whom any risk\r\nwas preferable to the certain fate which must attend remaining on the\r\nwreck during the coming tide.\r\n\r\nBut, notwithstanding his partial recovery, he still felt very feeble and\r\nquite unequal to more exertion. As nothing in the way of an attempt to\r\nsave his life was possible until the broken topmast was lodged firmly\r\nagainst the cliff, he wondered whether he would find some sort of food\r\nin the forecastle.\r\n\r\nIt was improbable, of course. Meals were brought from the cook's galley\r\namidships, and utensils only were stored in the lockers of the dingy\r\nsaloon in which he and many of the sailors used to eat.\r\n\r\nStill, spurred by the necessity of doing something to take his mind off\r\nthe fearsome alternative should the forecastle topple over sideways, or\r\neven remain in its present position, he turned his back on the cliff.\r\nWith never a glance at the bridge, he regained the sloping deck, lowered\r\nhimself to the doorway of his own cabin, and peered into the gloom in\r\nthe effort to determine how best and where to begin his search.\r\n\r\nAt first his heart sank, because the saloon was awash. Then he\r\nremembered the Spanish sailor's queer offer of a bottle of brandy,\r\nstored in a kit-bag in number seven berth, \"the lowest bunk on the\r\nleft.\"\r\n\r\nNumber seven! Had he not seen the man at odd times entering or leaving\r\nthe second cabin on the port side? At any rate, there was no harm in\r\ntrying.\r\n\r\nCrawling farther into the darkness, he walked on what was normally the\r\ncross bulkhead of the saloon, groped to a doorway, found a kit-bag in\r\nthe stated position, opened it, and came upon a bottle of brandy!\r\n\r\nHe drank a little. Luckily it was not the raw spirit beloved of such\r\nmen as its late owner, but sound, mellow liquor, which the Spaniard\r\nhad probably bought as a medicine.\r\n\r\nBe that as it may, the brandy exercised the magical effect which good\r\ncognac always produces in those wise enough not to vitiate the blood\r\nwith alcohol when in robust health. For the first time since he was\r\nstruck down, Maseden felt himself capable of putting forth physical\r\neffort involving sustained muscular exertion.\r\n\r\nHe returned to his own cabin, secured the poncho, or cloak, and wrapped\r\nthe bottle in it. Rummaging round in the dark, he laid hands on a strap,\r\nwith which he buckled the folded poncho tightly to his shoulders. Then\r\nreviewing the prospects which awaited an unfortunate castaway on that\r\ninhospitable coast, he endeavored to get at his own trunk.\r\n\r\nTherein, however, he failed. The iron frame of the bunk had buckled, and\r\nthe trunk was held as in a vise.\r\n\r\nRealizing that he had very little time before the light in the interior\r\nof the forecastle would vanish altogether, he hurried back to the\r\nSpaniard's berth and hauled out the kit-bag. He had an uncomfortable\r\nfeeling that he was robbing the dead, but if it were practicable to land\r\nany sort of stores the effort should be made.\r\n\r\nHe had not a moment to spare for further search. The forecastle slipped\r\nagain, and he experienced no little difficulty in regaining his perch on\r\nthe solid stump of the foremast, on which, so nearly had it approached\r\nthe horizontal, he could sit quite easily.\r\n\r\nThe dangling spar, he estimated, was now about eight feet from the\r\ncliff. Would it catch the rock wall while any glimmer of light remained,\r\nor would some new movement of the wreck divert its progress? He could\r\nonly hope for the best and be ready to seize the opportunity when, if\r\never, it presented itself.\r\n\r\nTo his thinking, the gale was moderating; but he dared not indulge in\r\nthe smallest hope that the forecastle would live through the next tide.\r\nThe heavy swell of the Pacific after a westerly storm would create a\r\nworse sea on the reef than that already experienced. Probably the\r\nbreakers would be more destructive immediately after than during the\r\ngale.\r\n\r\nIt was at that moment, when in a plight seldom equaled and never\r\nsurpassed by any man destined to survive a disastrous shipwreck, that\r\nMaseden's thoughts reverted to his fellow passengers. There was no\r\nneed to watch the spar, since he could not fail to become aware of any\r\nfurther movement of the forecastle, so he lashed the kit-bag to a sail\r\nring, again turned his back on the cliff, and gave close attention to\r\nthe chart-house.\r\n\r\nDespite the increasing darkness it was a good deal more visible now\r\nthan when he had looked that way earlier. No dense clouds of spray or\r\nspindrift intervened; hence he noticed for the first time the improvised\r\nshutters which had replaced the glass front of the structure on the\r\nseaward side.\r\n\r\nHe was wondering whether or not it was possible that some one might\r\nstill be living on the only other part of the ship still intact, when\r\nhe became aware of a figure silhouetted against the sky above the canvas\r\nscreen of the bridge.\r\n\r\nIt was, in fact, the captain, who crept out of the chart-house every now\r\nand then to examine the state of the iron uprights and the condition of\r\nthe reef. The gallant old sailor had abandoned, or never formed, any\r\nnotion of escape, because nothing could live for an instant on the reef\r\nitself, and he could not possibly detect the chance of salvation offered\r\nby the broken mast. But the nature of the man demanded that he should\r\nkeep watch and ward over those committed to his care. In all likelihood\r\nhe experienced a vague sense of relief in being able to discharge even\r\nthe melancholy duty of noting the gradual breaking-up of the supports.\r\n\r\nThree had gone, two on the port side and one on the starboard. When the\r\nthird stanchion yielded on the port side, bridge and chart-room would\r\nfall with a crash and there would be an end. He said nothing of this to\r\nthe unhappy company within.\r\n\r\n\"The weather is improving,\" he told them cheerfully, as Maseden heard\r\nlater. \"I can't honestly give you any prospect of escape, but--while\r\nthere's life there's hope!\"\r\n\r\nAnd all the time he was listening for the ominous crack which would be\r\nthe precursor of that final sinking into the depths! The marvel was\r\nthat the middle of the ship had held together so long, but by no miracle\r\nknown to man could what was left of her survive the next tide.\r\n\r\nYet why should he add to misery already abyssmal? Death would be a\r\nblessed relief; waiting for certain death was the worst of tortures.\r\n\r\nNo one answered. The survivors--of the twelve four were dead now--were\r\nperishing with cold and dumbly resigned to their wretched fate. Had it\r\nnot been for the protection afforded by the improvised screen, none\r\nwould have been alive even then.\r\n\r\nThe wind still swirled and eddied into every nook and cranny. Though\r\nhuddled together, the little group of men and women were conscious of\r\nno warmth. It was with the greatest difficulty that those not clad in\r\noilskins kept any garments on their bodies.\r\n\r\nSo merciless is the havoc of the sea that its victims are stripped naked\r\neven while clinging to the battered hulk of a ship, though this last\r\ndevice of a seemingly demoniac savagery is easily accounted for. No\r\nproduct of loom or spinning machine can withstand the disintegrating\r\neffects of breaking waves helped by a fierce gale. The seams and\r\nfastenings of ordinary garments cannot resist the combined assault. In\r\nsuch circumstances, a woman's flimsy attire will be torn off her in a\r\nfew minutes, while the strongest of boots have been known to collapse\r\nafter some hours of this kind of exposure.\r\n\r\nLuckily a number of oilskins were kept in the chart-room of the\r\n_Southern Cross_; these were quickly served out to the shivering girls,\r\nwhose clothing had practically melted away as though made of thin paper.\r\n\r\nSoon after the captain had tried to hearten them with that scrap of\r\nproverbial philosophy, one of the girls, Nina, screamed in an elfin note\r\nthat dominated even the roaring of the reef for an instant. Her father\r\nhad collapsed. It was useless to pretend that he might only have\r\nfainted. They who fell now were doomed. In Mr. Gray's case, he was dead\r\nere he sank down.\r\n\r\nThe chief officer put a consoling hand on the girl's shoulder. He was a\r\nBostonian, and had daughters of his own. In that hour of tribulation his\r\nspeech reverted to the homely accents of New England.\r\n\r\n\"It comes hard to see your father drop like that,\" he said. \"But it's\r\nbetter so. He's just spared a bit of the trouble we may have to face.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not that,\" wailed the girl brokenly. \"I'm thinking of my mother.\r\nShe will never know. Oh, if I could only make her understand, I would\r\nnot care!\"\r\n\r\nA strange answer, the sailor deemed it, most probably. At that instant\r\nhe caught the captain's eye. Both men had the same thought. The dead\r\nshould be thrown overboard and thus lessen the weight supported by the\r\none stanchion on the port side.\r\n\r\nBut of what avail were such precautions? They might as well all go\r\ntogether, the quick and the dead. Why should any of them wish to live on\r\nuntil the sea rose again in the small hours of the morning?\r\n\r\nThe girls were crying in each other's arms. Two of the men lifted Gray's\r\nbody and placed it with four others. Five gone out of twelve!\r\n\r\nThe captain, speaking in the most matter-of-fact way, suggested that\r\nthey should open and drink the last bottle of claret before the light\r\nfailed.\r\n\r\n\"It's a poor substitute for a meal,\" he said, \"but it's the only thing\r\nwe can lay hands on.\"\r\n\r\nThe chief officer nodded his head towards the grief-stricken sisters.\r\n\r\n\"Maybe we can wait a bit longer,\" he said. \"You couldn't persuade them\r\nto touch it just now.... What's that, sir? Did you hear anything?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. What could we possibly hear?\"\r\n\r\n\"It sounded like a voice, some one hailing.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I know whose voice it is,\" said the captain. He himself had\r\nalmost yielded to the delusion. It was distressing to find the same\r\neery symptom of speedy breakdown in his old friend, the chief officer.\r\n\r\nBoth men listened, nevertheless, and were convinced. In silence they\r\nwent out into the open, walking stealthily. Each knew that any undue\r\nmovement might send the remains of the ship headlong to the reef. They\r\nstrained their eyes in the only possible direction from which a voice\r\nmight have come--the scrap of forecastle, sixty feet nearer the\r\nheadland, or, incredible as it seemed, the headland itself. They could\r\nsee nothing. Maseden's body was not only in line with the receding angle\r\nof the foremast, but that piece of the wreck was merged in the gloom of\r\nthe towering rock.\r\n\r\nMaseden saw them, however, and shouted again, striving his uttermost now\r\nthat he had attracted attention.\r\n\r\nWith each effort at speech his voice was becoming stronger. Though it\r\nwas useless to think of conveying an intelligible message through the\r\nuproar of wind and water, he fancied he could get into communication\r\nwith the inmates of the chart-room, provided they were on the alert. In\r\neffect, he had a knife, and was surrounded by an abundance of tangled\r\ncordage, and it would be a strange thing if after so many years of\r\nactive life on a South American ranch he could not cast a weighted lasso\r\nas far as the bridge.\r\n\r\nHe began fashioning the necessary coil at once, working with feverish\r\nhaste, because his refuge was on the move again, and ever towards the\r\nland. A trial cast fell short, as he had not allowed enough lee-way for\r\nthe wind. He was gathering up the rope preparatory to another effort\r\nwhen a great voice boomed at him from the shadows:\r\n\r\n\"You have no chance here. You are as well off where you are. If you hear\r\nme, hail three times!\"\r\n\r\nThe captain was using a megaphone.\r\n\r\nMaseden yelled \"Hi!\" three times, thinking the short, sharp syllable\r\nwould carry best. Then, with splendid judgment, he threw the lasso in a\r\nlateral parabola that landed its end across the rail of the bridge,\r\nwhere it was promptly made fast by the first officer.\r\n\r\nAgain came that mighty voice:\r\n\r\n\"Is there any hope of escape on your side? If so, hail three times.\"\r\n\r\nHe replied. After a short delay he heard the order:\r\n\r\n\"Haul in!\"\r\n\r\nAttached to the noose of his rope was another rope, and a second thinner\r\none, rigged as a \"whip,\" or communicating cord. Tied at the junction was\r\nthe megaphone. The intent of the senders was plain. He was to bawl\r\ndirections, and they would obey.\r\n\r\nHe fancied that by this time the topmast must be near the rock, if not\r\nquite touching it, but he had decided already that he would either save\r\nthose hapless people in the chart-room or die in the attempt.\r\n\r\nPerhaps his \"wife\" was there yet. Unless those American sailors had\r\nbroken the first law of their order of chivalry, the women committed to\r\ntheir care had been safeguarded.\r\n\r\nWell, he owed her a life. Now he might be able to repay the debt in\r\nfull.\r\n\r\nHe had never before handled a speaking trumpet, so his initial essay was\r\nbrief:\r\n\r\n\"Can you hear?\"\r\n\r\nHe could just catch three faint sounds in answer.\r\n\r\n\"As soon as a sailor can cross by the rope, send one,\" he shouted, \"I\r\nshall need help at this end. I have made fast the heavy rope. Shall I\r\nhaul in the whip?\"\r\n\r\nThere was a pause of a few seconds, but he counted on that. Then he felt\r\nthree tugs on the thinner cord, and began to haul steadily. Soon, by the\r\nsagging of the main rope and the weight at the end of the whip, he\r\nrealized that some one was making the transit.\r\n\r\nBefore long he discerned a figure coming towards him hand over hand\r\nalong the rope. The man's feet were caught midway by the seas boiling\r\nover the reef, but Maseden knew that the gallant fellow's forward\r\nmovement was never checked, and in a very little while the breathless\r\nchief officer was seated astride the mast beneath him.\r\n\r\n\"Who in the world are you?\" demanded the newcomer; at any rate, he used\r\nwords to that effect.\r\n\r\nMaseden answered in kind, and explained his project; whereupon the chief\r\nofficer seized the megaphone and bellowed the necessary instructions. On\r\na given signal the two men hauled on the whip.\r\n\r\nThis time a figure lashed to a life-buoy, which, in turn, was tied to a\r\npulley traveling on the guide-rope, came to them out of the darkness. It\r\nwas a woman, hardly in her senses, yet able to obey when told to sit\r\nastride the mast and hold fast to a ring.\r\n\r\n\"We can hardly find room for five more people here,\" shouted the chief\r\nofficer. \"Are you game to shin along the mast and see if that loose spar\r\nis practicable yet?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Maseden.\r\n\r\nHe vanished in the darkness. He was absent fully five minutes, a period\r\nwhich, to the waiting chief officer, who alone knew what was actually\r\nhappening, must have seemed like as many hours. Then Maseden returned.\r\nBy this time there were two more astride the foremast, four in all. He\r\ntied the nearest one to his back with a rope.\r\n\r\n\"Can you steady yourself by placing your hands on my shoulders, but not\r\naround my neck?\" he said.\r\n\r\nFor answer two slim hands caught his shoulders. He began working his way\r\nforward into the gloom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE LOTTERY\r\n\r\n\r\nMaseden's prolonged absence on the first occasion was readily accounted\r\nfor by what he had done. When he reached the end of the foremast--at the\r\njunction of spars known to the sailor as the couplings--he found that\r\nthe topmast was, in fact, thrust tightly against the rock wall.\r\n\r\nThus far, his most sanguine calculations had been justified to the\r\nletter.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible to determine how the other end of that precarious\r\nbridge was secured. He saw at once, however, that a great strain was\r\nbeing placed already on the stays which attached it, by chance and\r\nloosely at first, but now with ever-increasing rigidity, to the lower\r\nmast. He thought that a vigorous kick would ease the pressure by partly\r\nfreeing one of the wire ropes which had become entangled in the\r\nsplintered wood.\r\n\r\nOf course, he was only choosing the lesser of two evils. If the spar\r\nsnapped a second time, the last hope of rescue was absolutely destroyed.\r\nOn the other hand, by reducing the thrust on the retaining spar, the\r\nforecastle might slip.\r\n\r\nHe kicked, and the stay was released! To the best of his belief the\r\nwreck did not move.\r\n\r\nFastening the seaward end of the topmast in a rough and ready fashion,\r\nin such wise that it was held in position, yet allowed some play if\r\nsubjected to irresistible weight, he tested it with one hand. It\r\nremained taut. Then, murmuring something which had the semblance of a\r\nprayer, he committed himself to the crossing.\r\n\r\nThe wind carried his body out at an astonishing angle, but he held on.\r\nOf course, he had not far to travel, because a steamer's topmast is of\r\nno great length, but, if he lives to become a centenarian, Maseden will\r\nnever forget the extraordinary thrill of thankfulness and jubilation\r\nwhich ran through every fibre when his right foot rested on a projecting\r\nknob of rock.\r\n\r\nA ghostly light coming from the white maelstrom beneath enabled him to\r\nmake sure that the crevice in which the spar had stuck extended some\r\ndistance into the face of the cliff. He scrambled ashore, and found that\r\na narrow ledge ran inward about the height of his breast. It was\r\npracticable as far as a hand could reach; so, well knowing how precious\r\nwas every second, he commenced the return journey.\r\n\r\nHe simply did not allow himself to think. The slightest hesitation might\r\nhave been fatal. He could form no sort of estimate of his own nervous\r\nstrength. He knew that any man's willpower may carry him to a certain\r\npoint and then desert him. He realized that he was leaving a sort of\r\nsafety for a no mean chance of speedy death; but there is safety that is\r\ndishonor, and death that is everlastingly honorable.\r\n\r\nWithout any semblance of hesitation, this gallant young American swung\r\nforth to the desolation and chaos he had just quitted.\r\n\r\nNor did his spirit quail when he had deposited a helpless woman on the\r\nledge. But his hands fumbled in untying the rope which had bound her to\r\nhim, and he became conscious of an affrighting lassitude which brought\r\nwith it a grimmer menace than the howling furies of the reef.\r\n\r\nHe tried to persuade himself that the poncho strapped to his back had\r\nmade the burden of another body almost unbearable. Hurriedly unfastening\r\nit, he said to his collapsed companion--or, rather shouted, because the\r\ndin created by the breakers was almost stupefying:\r\n\r\n\"Are you able to hold this?\"\r\n\r\nProbably she replied, but her utterance was swept away by the wind ere\r\nthe words had crossed her lips. She took the folded cloak in her hands,\r\nand the action sufficed.\r\n\r\nThen Maseden left her. During this second crossing to the forecastle he\r\nknew beyond range of doubt that he had reached the limit of physical\r\nendurance. He had eaten nothing during many hours, he had been knocked\r\ninsensible and had lost a good deal of blood. It was not in human nature\r\nthat any man, howsoever fit and active he might be, could survive these\r\nheavy drains on his energies and yet put forth the sustained effort now\r\ncalled for.\r\n\r\nIt tasked his grit to the uttermost to go on this time. He knew in his\r\nheart that a third double passage was not to be thought of.\r\n\r\nSo, during the brief respite while a wholly insensible woman was being\r\ntied to him, he contrived to shout to the nearest man on the spar:\r\n\r\n\"I'm all in! You fellows must follow as best you can. It's not so bad\r\nfor a man crossing alone. Turn your back to the wind.\"\r\n\r\nHe had adopted that method while carrying the girl already on the rock,\r\nand the force of the gale had seemed to exert less drag on his arms.\r\n\r\nIt needed a real life-and-death struggle to gain the ledge this time.\r\nDuring a minute or longer he could not even endeavor to undo the rope.\r\nHe merely lurched forward on to the tiny platform and sank in a heap\r\nwith the inert body of a girl bound to his back. Then he felt dizzily\r\nthat someone was gaining a foothold on the rock behind. With a mighty\r\neffort he bundled his own body and the girl's out of the way.\r\n\r\nHe fancied he heard a shout and a scream, but was beyond knowing or\r\ncaring what had happened. Had he slipped down into the raging vortex\r\nbeneath and been whirled to almost instant death he would have felt a\r\nsense of relief that the long drawn-out and unequal fight was ended.\r\n\r\nHe revived under the stress of a new horror. He found himself gazing\r\nblankly into a dim obscurity in which there was neither broken topmast\r\nnor unheaved forecastle. The tons of metal piled on a slippery rock had\r\nvanished completely, and the hapless few who had survived the slow agony\r\nof those hours of waiting in the chart-room were hurled to death at the\r\nvery moment when fate tantalized them with the prospect of rescue!\r\n\r\nSomeone bawled huskily in his ear:\r\n\r\n\"They've gone! My God! What rotten luck! I could almost have touched the\r\nman crossing behind me!... Can we get these girls out of this?... Which\r\nway did you come?\"\r\n\r\nIt was the young American passenger, Sturgess. He imagined that the man\r\nwho had brought hope and life to the doomed survivors of the _Southern\r\nCross_ had reached the vessel from the land and could now pilot the\r\nthree who alone were saved to some place where food and repose would be\r\nattainable.\r\n\r\n\"I'm tied to someone,\" Maseden contrived to say. \"Try and unfasten the\r\nrope, and shove me up on to the ledge.... I'm all in, but I'll soon be\r\nbetter.... Mind you hold fast yourself!\"\r\n\r\nSturgess, though only a degree less exhausted, did as he was asked.\r\nSprawling weakly over the prostrate body of the second of the two girls,\r\nMaseden felt in the darkness for the other one.\r\n\r\nHe discovered that she had collapsed sideways in a faint, but, by some\r\nmarvel, the folded cloak had not rolled down the side of the precipice.\r\nHis hands were feeble and numb, but he contrived to unfasten the strap.\r\nThe bottle of brandy was uninjured, and, so unnerved was he by knowing\r\nthat the spirit probably meant all the difference between life and death\r\nfor four people--at any rate till dawn--that he actually dropped it.\r\n\r\nAgain Providence intervened. It fell on the thick poncho, and did not\r\nbreak.\r\n\r\nFilled with savage resolve to conquer this weakness, he grasped the\r\nbottle more firmly, drew the cork with his teeth, and, resisting the\r\nimpulse to swallow the contents in great gulps, sipped some of the\r\nliquor slowly.\r\n\r\nHe did not offer any to the others at that moment. His mind was clearing\r\nnow, and he saw that the one vital thing needed was that he should\r\nrecover control of his mental and bodily powers. A few minutes more or\r\nless of collapse mattered not so much to his companions as that he\r\nshould lead or carry them to a less exposed position. Then the brandy\r\nwould be really effective. At present, to hand it around in the\r\ndarkness, while wind and spindrift were whipping them with scorpions,\r\nwas merely courting the disaster which he himself had so narrowly\r\naverted.\r\n\r\nThe other man had gained the ledge. He could not see Maseden, because\r\neach inch of space increased an obscurity already akin to that of a\r\ntomb, but he leaned forward and caught his arm.\r\n\r\n\"Say!\" he yelled. \"Isn't there some way out? We'll die quick if we stop\r\nhere!\"\r\n\r\n\"You must wait a little,\" said Maseden. \"I, like yourself, was on board\r\nthe ship. I'm going to stand up now and prospect a bit by feeling my\r\nway. Take care that neither of the women falls off. They _are_ women,\r\naren't they?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. D'ye think we'd send men ashore first?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was not certain that both girls were still living.\"\r\n\r\nWhat a time and place for a discussion on the etiquette of life-saving\r\nat sea! It was typical of their race and type.\r\n\r\nPlacing the bottle in a breast pocket Maseden rose cautiously to his\r\nfeet. Gripping the rock with his hands, he stepped over the unconscious\r\nform of the first girl he brought ashore. Evidently she had collapsed\r\nwhen the forecastle was swept away before her eyes.\r\n\r\nThe ledge led straight into the crevice he had entered during daylight,\r\nand though very uneven, trended generally upward. He had to depend, of\r\ncourse, wholly on the sense of touch, since the darkness here was that\r\nof a deep mine.\r\n\r\nSome thirty feet inland he was halted abruptly. The ledge seemed to\r\nwiden out and then end against an overhanging rock. But the place was\r\ndry, and the wind hardly penetrated, while the deafening thunder of the\r\nreef had died down to a harsh growl. By comparison with the sea face\r\nthis secluded nook was a niche in Paradise. At any rate, here it was\r\npossible to await daylight without necessarily dying from exposure.\r\n\r\nHe hurried back, having memorized each inequality of floor and wall on\r\nthe journey of exploration.\r\n\r\n\"Are you able to carry one of those girls?\" he shouted to Sturgess when\r\nhe was once more in the midst of the external uproar.\r\n\r\n\"How far?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not more than fifteen short strides. Take her in your left arm, and\r\nfeel the rock face on the right. Keep close in. I'm not certain about\r\nthe width of this ledge. It rises a little, but is fairly straight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go right ahead!\"\r\n\r\nSoon the two men were in the haven of shelter at the further end. Each\r\nwas clasping an inanimate woman, but happily, speech no longer demanded\r\na straining of vocal chords.\r\n\r\n\"Is this the limit of the accommodation?\" inquired Sturgess, obeying his\r\nguide's restraining hand.\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do we sit right down and hope that the sun will rise sometime?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not yet.... Here! Grope this way. I am giving you a bottle of brandy.\r\nDrink some, not much, because we must hoard it. Then we'll try and get a\r\nfew drops between these girls' teeth. After that we must rub their hands\r\nand ankles till the friction hurts. It may revive them. I don't know. It\r\nis the only plan I can think of. When they recover, if ever, we'll seat\r\nthem side by side with their backs to the rock, you and I will squeeze\r\nclose, one on each side, and I have a poncho which will cover the lot.\r\nBy that means we may obtain some degree of warmth in common.\"\r\n\r\n\"Old man, you said a page full!\"\r\n\r\nThere was silence for a few seconds. Then Sturgess said gratefully:\r\n\r\n\"Gee! That's some tonic! Now, how about those girls?\"\r\n\r\n\"Give me the bottle. This lady was conscious when I brought her ashore.\r\nShe may recover quickly.\"\r\n\r\nThe almost tangible blackness in which the little group of people was\r\nwrapped greatly enhanced the difficulties attending restorative\r\nmeasures. Maseden discovered that the abundant hair of the girl he was\r\nhugging so closely to his heart had become loose, and was in a wet\r\ntangle about her throat and mouth.\r\n\r\nThe clinging strands were troublesome, but, by prizing her lips open\r\nbetween a finger and thumb, he contrived to make her swallow a few drops\r\nof the brandy. In fact, while he was yet doubting the efficacy of the\r\ndose, some slight convulsive movements showed that consciousness was\r\nreturning.\r\n\r\nHe laid her carefully down, and told the American to do likewise with\r\nthe sister. Sturgess seemed to be curiously slow to obey, and Maseden\r\nadmonished him sharply, thinking the other might be dazed.\r\n\r\n\"Now, rub hard!\" he said. \"First her left hand--then her left ankle.\"\r\n\r\nBoth set to work with a will. Maseden could not understand why the\r\nunhappy girl should be nearly naked. The stockings had fallen about her\r\nshoes. For the rest, her chief garment was an oilskin coat.\r\n\r\nHe, be it remembered, had been spared the hard usage of the waves, and\r\nhis clothing was better adapted to existing conditions. He was shocked\r\nto find how cold she was, how icy and lifeless her flesh. He urged\r\nSturgess not to spare her.\r\n\r\nTheir rough and ready massage soon proved effective. The girl gasped\r\nsomething incoherent, and strove to withdraw her limbs from a distinctly\r\nstrenuous handling.\r\n\r\n\"_She's_ nearly all right, now,\" announced Maseden briskly. \"Sharp's the\r\nword with the other one.\"\r\n\r\nThe second patient offered a longer task. By the time she gave any sign\r\nof life her sister was frantically asking what had become of her, and\r\nwas only quieted by Maseden saying sternly:\r\n\r\n\"You will help most by not bothering us. We are doing our best for your\r\nsister. She is here, and may recover. That is all I can tell you.\"\r\n\r\n\"We? Who are we?\" came the broken cry.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Sturgess, yourself, your sister and I. My name is Maseden.\"\r\n\r\nHe caught a strangled gasp of astonishment, but Sturgess broke in\r\nbreathlessly, for the exertion was warming him:\r\n\r\n\"Great Scott! You've got my name pat, Mr. Maseden. D'ye mean--to\r\ntell--me--you were--on board--that poor old ship?\"\r\n\r\n\"Rub! And don't talk!... She moved a little then.\"\r\n\r\nHis judgment was well founded. Within a few minutes he heard the second\r\ngirl address her sister as Nina.\r\n\r\nSo this one was Madge, his wife! He had literally brought her back from\r\nthe very gates of death. He could not even see her. What a curious\r\ncoincidence that when she saved his life, and he saved hers, she was\r\nequally hidden from him; then by a veil, now by the pall of the darkest\r\nnight he had ever experienced!\r\n\r\nThe girls began exchanging broken confidences. Madge, who had fainted\r\nwhile being towed across the fearsome chasm between bridge and\r\nforecastle, did not know of the loss of the captain and chief and second\r\nofficers, with a passenger, until told by Nina. She wept bitterly, and\r\nMaseden could not help noticing that Sturgess tried to console her in a\r\nvery lover-like manner.\r\n\r\nHe actually smiled at the tragic humor of it all, especially when Nina\r\nseemed to sense his thought, and valiantly interfered by bidding Madge\r\nnot to add to their misery by useless grief. He refrained purposely from\r\ngiving them any more brandy until some time had elapsed. Now that their\r\nfaculties were restored, he knew, from his own experiences, that their\r\ntongues and palates were on fire with the salt-laden atmosphere they had\r\nperforce inhaled during so many hours.\r\n\r\nBut each minute of quiet in this sheltered nook, and in breathable air,\r\nwould do much to alleviate their suffering, and he trusted to the brandy\r\nto put them to sleep.\r\n\r\nIn effect, that was what actually happened. When each of the four had\r\nswallowed a small quantity of the spirit Maseden and Sturgess nestled in\r\nbeside the two girls and tucked the poncho over knees and feet. The\r\nbodies of the men served as excellent shields. In the physical and\r\nmental reaction which set in with the consciousness of assured\r\nsafety--because that was what both girls thought, and neither man cared\r\nto weaken their faith--they were sound asleep within half an hour of the\r\ntime they left the wreck.\r\n\r\nSturgess, too, was worn out, and slept fitfully, but it was long before\r\nMaseden's overtaxed nerves would yield. He could not help speculating as\r\nto what wretched hap the coming day might bring. There was a gnawing\r\ndread in his mind that they might be lodged in a fissure of an\r\nunscalable cliff. If that were so, what a fearsome prospect lay before\r\nthem! The mere notion was unendurable, and he resolutely refused to\r\ndwell on it.\r\n\r\nThen he mused on the queer chance which, even in this small company,\r\ndivorced him from his wife. He had rescued Nina first. By the accident\r\nof situation he was nearest the rock which closed the ledge, and she\r\nnext. It was her body, not his wife's, to which he was close pressed,\r\nand in which his more vigorous frame had already induced a certain\r\ncomfortable warmth.\r\n\r\nHer head had fallen on his shoulder. An unconscious movement revealed\r\nthat some roughness in the rock wall was hurtful, so he put his left arm\r\naround her neck and pillowed her gently.\r\n\r\nTry as he might, he found himself still brooding on the chances of the\r\ncoming day. Fortune favoring, they might find a way to the summit of the\r\ncliff. Would they be much better off? Water they would surely\r\nobtain--but what of food?\r\n\r\nSomehow, in such woful plight, a man's mind turns instinctively to a\r\npipe. He actually had a cherished briar between his teeth and a tobacco\r\npouch in his hand, when his heart sank at the remembrance that he had\r\nstruck the last match in the only box of matches in his pocket after\r\nbreakfast that morning. He recollected tossing the empty box into the\r\nsea. Subsequently, in lighting a cigar, he had borrowed a match.\r\n\r\nSearching his pockets without disturbing the exhausted girl by his side,\r\nhe made sure of the unhappy truth. He had no match. Even if they reached\r\nthe interior of the island they could not possibly start a fire.\r\n\r\nHe knew at once that Sturgess, who had been soaked in salt water for\r\nmany hours, was in a worse predicament than himself, because his own\r\nclothing was dry inside, whereas the other was wet to the skin, and any\r\nmatches he might have carried must be in a pulp.\r\n\r\nTucked away in a money belt, Maseden carried ten thousand dollars in\r\nAmerican bills, yet one small box of matches would be of far greater\r\npractical value in that hour than all the money. Slight wonder, then, if\r\nhis stout heart failed him at last and the darkness closed in on his\r\nsoul as on his eyes.\r\n\r\nThe sleeping girl, conscious only of warmth and protection, snuggled her\r\nhead a little nearer.\r\n\r\n\"Mother, darling,\" she murmured, \"we had to do it! We had no choice. It\r\nwas for your dear sake!\"\r\n\r\nThat was all--some troubled confidence of a dream--but it sufficed to\r\nset Maseden musing on the strange vortex into which fate had sucked him\r\nfrom the peace and seclusion of Los Andes ranch.\r\n\r\nHis mind wandered. He saw again the magnificent groves of mahogany trees\r\nand coyal palms, with their golden flowers fully three feet in height,\r\nand the _chicka_ sap oozing from the bark. He sauntered through the\r\nwell-cultivated plantations of bananas, yams, arrow-root, guavas, and\r\nall the fruit and cereals which that favored region of Central America\r\nproduces in such abundance that men grow lazy and are content to plot\r\nand thieve rather than toil. He particularly recalled a number of\r\n\"chocolate\" trees, the marvelous growth which yields a more delicately\r\nflavored beverage than the cocoa-tree.\r\n\r\nThe original owner of the ranch prided himself on these\r\ntrees--botanically, the _Herrania purpurea_--because they were not\r\nindigenous to San Juan, but had been brought from Guatemala. Los Andes\r\nranch was indeed a veritable Garden of Eden.\r\n\r\nWhile roaming through it in spirit Maseden dropped off to sleep.\r\n\r\nAnd that was a kindly act on the part of a Providence which marks even\r\nthe fall of a sparrow from a house-top. A full day lay before this man\r\nand those others committed to his care. Even a couple of hours' fitful\r\nrepose served as a splendid restorative. Without some such respite he\r\ncould never have faced and carried through the almost Sisyphean task\r\nwhich awaited him at daylight.\r\n\r\nHe awoke with a shiver. He was chilled to the bone. Not knowing what he\r\nwas doing, he had drawn the poncho closely over Nina Gray, leaving his\r\nown limbs almost uncovered. Startled lest the others might be stiff in\r\ndeath, since his clothes were dry, while theirs, such as they possessed,\r\nwere wet, he touched the girl's cheek. It was quite warm and soft.\r\n\r\nThe oilskins she and her sister wore and the huddling together of the\r\nfour under the heavy poncho had generated a moist heat which probably\r\nhelped to preserve the two delicate women from some type of deadly\r\npneumonia.\r\n\r\nAt first it did not strike Maseden as strange that he should be able to\r\nsee her face. As the initial feeling of panic passed, and he glanced\r\naround, he understood what had happened. The sky was clear, and the\r\nmoon, late risen, was spreading a mild radiance over rocks and sea.\r\n\r\nBy raising himself a little, so as not to disturb the sleeper still\r\ntrustfully tucked under his arm, he peered sidewise down on the reef.\r\nThe tide was high, and great rollers were smashing over the barrier\r\nwhich had broken the _Southern Cross_.\r\n\r\nSo far as he could tell, not a vestige of the ship remained. Bridge and\r\nchart-house had vanished. He fancied that some part of the framework\r\naccounted for a particularly vexed boiling of the surges on a spot where\r\nthe engines and stoke-hold had lodged. But that was only guesswork.\r\n\r\nThe morning tide had done its work with thoroughness. The _Southern\r\nCross_ had become a memory.\r\n\r\nThen he surveyed the ledge and the cleft. Apparently, at this point, he\r\nwas some twenty feet above high-water mark. To the left was the sea. To\r\nthe right, the rock overhung the ledge in such wise that the place was\r\nalmost a cave. This fact, combined with the elevation of the opposite\r\nwall, explained the shelter the castaways had been vouchsafed from the\r\nbitter gale now blowing itself out. But it was affrighting to realize\r\nthat the very physical feature which provided a refuge might also immure\r\nthem in a living tomb.\r\n\r\nHe shuddered, and moved involuntarily, and the girl awoke with a start.\r\n\r\nShe lifted her head, and gazed at him with uncomprehending eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Where am I?\" she said, rather in wonderment than alarm.\r\n\r\n\"Somewhere on the coast of Chile,\" he said.\r\n\r\nShe extricated a hand from the folds of the poncho and swept the errant\r\nhair from her face. Turning partly, she looked at her sister and\r\nSturgess.\r\n\r\n\"I remember now,\" she said slowly. Then she discovered that Maseden's\r\narm was supporting her shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"Have you held me like that all night?\" she inquired.\r\n\r\n\"'All night' is a figure of speech. It is not yet daybreak. This is\r\nmoonlight.\"\r\n\r\n\"The moon! Does the moon still shine? But your arm must be weary.\"\r\n\r\nMaseden was just beginning to realize that he owned a left arm.\r\nCirculation was being restored, and he knew it.\r\n\r\n\"Now that you mention it,\" he said quietly, \"I believe it is.\"\r\n\r\nShe spoke again, but he was in such agony that he broke out in a\r\nperspiration, a most fortunate circumstance, since he was perished with\r\ncold. The spasm did not last long, however, and he found his voice\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\"Are you Miss Nina Gray?\" he asked, and, in the same breath, was\r\nconscious of the absurd formality of the question in the conditions.\r\n\r\nShe did not answer.\r\n\r\n\"We may as well become acquainted,\" he went on, smiling at the queer\r\nturn their first words had taken.\r\n\r\n\"Now I remember everything,\" she said, burying her face in her hands.\r\n\r\n\"I can't have you crying,\" he muttered with a certain roughness. \"Tears\r\nwon't help. We're in a pretty bad fix, and must meet developments\r\ncalmly.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not crying,\" she said, dropping her hands, and looking at him as\r\nthough to offer proof.\r\n\r\n\"Then you can at least tell me your name, though I'm almost sure that\r\nyou are Nina. Even here, your sister, who is also my wife, keeps away\r\nfrom me.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is unjust. You saved both of us, but I kept my senses, and she did\r\nnot. You asked me if I was Nina Gray. I am not. My name is Nina Forbes.\"\r\n\r\nMaseden was stung into a revolt as fantastic as it was sudden.\r\n\r\n\"Good Lord!\" he cried. \"Are you married?\"\r\n\r\n\"Please let me explain. Mr. Gray was not my father, but my stepfather.\r\nMy mother married again. I--wanted to tell you. But does it really\r\nmatter? Why are we discussing such trivial things? Are we four the only\r\nsurvivors of the wreck?\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Gray died--while we were in the chart-room. He was an invalid--a\r\nneurotic. He could not withstand hardship of any sort. But the captain\r\nand chief officer were behind me on that mast.... Ah! I had forgotten\r\nthat. I fainted, didn't I?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\nMadge stirred uneasily. Their voices had aroused her.\r\n\r\n\"Don't be unkind to Madge,\" said the girl hurriedly. \"Neither of us\r\ncould help what happened in San Juan. We thought we were acting for the\r\nbest. Our lives are still in jeopardy, I imagine. Won't you be good and\r\nforget that unfortunate marriage?\"\r\n\r\n\"I won't talk of it, if that is what you mean. But I can hardly regard\r\nit as unfortunate. It undoubtedly saved my life.\"\r\n\r\nMadge awoke with a cry.\r\n\r\n\"Nina!\" she screamed. \"Oh, Nina, is that you? Are we really alive?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE VIGIL\r\n\r\n\r\nSturgess awoke, too. Soon they were talking freely, and Maseden not only\r\nlearned the heart-breaking story of the dozen refugees pent in the\r\nchart-house, but was told how he himself came by the blow on the head\r\nwhich took away his senses.\r\n\r\nMadge Gray, or Forbes, as he must now call her, was moved to thank\r\nProvidence for the intervention of the Spanish sailor.\r\n\r\n\"If that man hadn't picked you up, Mr. Maseden,\" she said, \"you would\r\nhave been washed overboard a few seconds later. Then nothing could have\r\nsaved any of us.\"\r\n\r\nShe seemed to be completely unaware of the sensation she created by\r\naddressing her rescuer by name. Maseden felt Nina's nervous little\r\nstart, but Sturgess put his astonishment into words.\r\n\r\n\"Maseden!\" he cried. \"You know our friend, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"I--I heard his name before--on the ship,\" came the faltered answer.\r\n\r\n\"Well, you heard more than _I_ did.... Are you the mysterious\r\nEnglish-speaking _vaquero_ who lived in the forecastle?\" and the\r\nquestioner bent a puzzled face sideways to try and discern the other\r\nman's features.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Maseden promptly. \"There need be no mystery about it now. I\r\ngot into trouble in Cartagena, shot the president-elect, and escaped in\r\nthe disguise of a Spanish cowboy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gee!\" exclaimed Sturgess.\r\n\r\nFor some reason best known to himself he displayed no further curiosity\r\nin the matter, though he might well have wondered how Madge Forbes had\r\ncome to identify that picturesque-looking person, Ramon Aliones, with\r\nthe American whose exploits had set all Cartagena agog the day before\r\nthe _Southern Cross_ sailed.\r\n\r\nThere was an uncomfortable pause, which Maseden broke by a laugh.\r\n\r\n\"So you see, Mr. Sturgess, I owed you a good turn, though you never\r\nguessed it. By your kindness in letting me carry your bag and share your\r\nboat I got away from my pursuers without attracting attention.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gee!\" said Sturgess again.\r\n\r\nHis comment probably denoted bewilderment. It may also have shown that\r\nthe speaker had just ascertained something which supplied food for\r\nthought. In the half light Maseden allowed himself to smile, because the\r\nconceit instantly leaped into his mind that his fellow-countryman might\r\nhave been told of that amazing marriage, and was now engaged in fitting\r\ntogether certain pieces of the puzzle.\r\n\r\nIf, for instance, Sturgess suspected that Madge Forbes was the lady who\r\nfigured in that extraordinary episode, he must realize that in paying\r\nher such marked attention during the voyage he had placed himself, if\r\nnot her, in a somewhat equivocal position.\r\n\r\n\"I had reason to believe that the captain recognized me,\" went on\r\nMaseden. \"Probably that is how Miss Forbes came to hear my name.\"\r\n\r\n\"Miss Forbes!\"\r\n\r\nThere was no mistaking the new note of surprise, even of annoyance, in\r\nSturgess's voice. He was gathering information at a rapid rate, and\r\nevidently found some difficulty in assimilating it.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" broke in Nina Forbes. \"That is my sister's name, and my own. Mr.\r\nGray was our stepfather. We passed as his daughters while traveling. The\r\narrangement prevented all sorts of misunderstandings. In any event, it\r\nconcerned none but ourselves. I only mentioned the fact casually to Mr.\r\nMaseden a few minutes ago.\"\r\n\r\nSome men might have caught a rebuke in the girl's words. Not so\r\nSturgess.\r\n\r\n\"I'm tickled to death at hearing it, anyhow,\" he said cheerfully. \"The\r\none thing I couldn't understand was how you two girls could be that poor\r\nchap's daughters.... Well, now we're all properly introduced, let's talk\r\nas though we really knew one another. Has any one the beginning of a\r\nnotion as to the time.\"\r\n\r\nThen Maseden remembered that he was wearing a watch which he had wound\r\nthat morning. He produced it, and was able to discern the hands.\r\n\r\n\"A quarter past two,\" he announced.\r\n\r\nA silence fell on them. Somehow the intimate and homely fact that one of\r\nthe little company possessed a watch which had not stopped served rather\r\nto enhance than allay the sense of peril and abandonment which their\r\nbrief talk had dispelled for the moment. A soldier who took part in that\r\nglorious but terrible retreat from Mons confessed afterwards that his\r\nspirit quailed once, and that was when he read the route names on a\r\nLondon suburban omnibus lying disabled and abandoned by the roadside.\r\n\r\nThe Marble Arch, Edgware Road, Maida Vale and Cricklewood--what had\r\nthese familiar localities to do with the crash of shell-fire and the\r\nspattering of bullets on the _pave_? Similarly, the forlorn castaways on\r\nHanover Island felt that a watch was an absurdly civilized thing among\r\nthe loud-voiced savageries of wind and wave.\r\n\r\nThe moonlight died away, too, with a suddenness that was almost\r\nunnerving. True, the moon had only vanished behind a cloud-bank. But her\r\nface was veiled effectually, and the growing darkness soon showed that\r\nshe would not be visible again that night.\r\n\r\nThey tried to sleep, but the effort failed. Lack of food was a more\r\nserious matter now than mere physical exhaustion. All four were young\r\nand vigorous enough to withstand fatigue, and to wake up refreshed after\r\nthe brief repose they had already enjoyed.\r\n\r\nBut they were stiff and cramped, and their blood was beginning to yield\r\nto a deadly chill. Though they huddled together as closely as possible,\r\nthere was no resisting the steady encroachment of the bitter cold.\r\n\r\nAt last Maseden counseled that they all stand up, and, despite the\r\nurgent need of conserving their energies, obtain some measure of warmth\r\nby stretching their limbs and breathing deeply.\r\n\r\nHe even suggested that they should sing, but the effort to start a\r\npopular chorus was such a lamentable failure that they laughed dismally.\r\n\r\nThen he tried story telling. He judged, and quite rightly, that the\r\nmajority of his hearers would be deeply interested in a recital of his\r\nown recent adventures.\r\n\r\nGreatly daring, he left out no detail, and, in a darkness which was\r\nalmost tangible because of its density, he was well aware how alert was\r\nevery ear to catch the true version of an extraordinary marriage.\r\n\r\nNo one interrupted. They just listened intently. Once, when he asked if\r\nhe was wearying them by a too exact description of events at the ranch\r\nafter his escape, Nina Forbes said quietly:\r\n\r\n\"Please tell us everything, Mr. Maseden. I have never heard anything\r\nhalf so interesting. You have caused me to forget where I am, and I can\r\ngive you no higher praise.\"\r\n\r\nAt last he made an end, dwelling purposely on the light note of his\r\ntroubles with the Spanish sailor who claimed a vested right in him after\r\nthe incident of the falling block.\r\n\r\nSturgess put a direct question or two.\r\n\r\n\"You don't seem to have any sort of a notion as to who the lady was?\" he\r\nbegan.\r\n\r\n\"I only know that her Christian name was Madeleine,\" answered Maseden\r\nreadily. \"She was about to sign the register when the idea of getting\r\nout of the Castle dawned on me, and, from that instant, I thought of\r\nnothing else. I hadn't much time, you know. The plan had to be concocted\r\nand carried out almost in the same breath. And there was no room for\r\nfailure. The least slip, either in time or method, and I was a dead\r\nman.\"\r\n\r\n\"Madeleine!\" mused Sturgess aloud. \"She was English, or American, I\r\nsuppose?\"\r\n\r\n\"American, I imagine. Undoubtedly one or the other.\"\r\n\r\n\"And that fat Steinbaum was the marriage broker! I know Steinbaum--a\r\nthug, if ever there was one.... What are you going to do about it, Mr.\r\nMaseden?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do about what?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, if you win clear from this present rather doubtful\r\nproposition--and we're backing you in that for all we're worth, ain't\r\nwe, girls?--you're tied up to a wife whom you don't know, and I guess\r\nthe one place in which you're likely to find her is off the map for you\r\nfor keeps.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not versed in the law,\" laughed Maseden, \"but it will be a queer\r\nthing if I should be compelled to regard myself as married to a lady\r\nwhom I have seen, certainly, but do not want.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you know you don't want her?\"\r\n\r\n\"I know nothing whatsoever about her.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's just it. That's where you may be hipped. She may be a peach, the\r\nfinest ever. Suppose, for the sake of argument, one of these two, Miss\r\nMadge or Miss Nina--\"\r\n\r\n\"The lady's name happened to be Madeleine,\" put in Madge instantly. \"If\r\nthe ceremony was meant to be valid she would undoubtedly sign her right\r\nname.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just so. You missed my point.\"\r\n\r\nMaseden thought it advisable to come to the rescue. He had conveyed to\r\nthe one vitally interested listener that her secret was safe for the\r\ntime, and this should suffice.\r\n\r\n\"I am inclined to think that I shall be proof against my nominal wife's\r\ncharms, no matter how great they may be,\" he said emphatically. \"There\r\nis a romantic side to the affair, I admit, but I cannot blind myself to\r\nthe fact that it possesses a prosaic one as well. Association with a\r\nskunk like Steinbaum is hardly the best of credentials, in the first\r\nplace. Secondly, one asks what motive any woman could have in wishing to\r\nmarry a man condemned to die. I'm not flattering myself that my personal\r\nqualifications carried much weight.\r\n\r\n\"Admittedly, the lady wanted to wed because I was about to disappear. I\r\ngive her the credit of believing that she would never have gone through\r\nwith the farce if she had the least reason to think that I would not be\r\ndead within the next half hour. But the fact remains that she was\r\ncallous and calculating--whether to serve her own ends or some other\r\nperson's is immaterial.... No, Mr. Sturgess; when, if ever, I choose a\r\nwife, it is long odds against her name being Madeleine.\"\r\n\r\nNina Forbes laughed, though her teeth chattered with the cold.\r\n\r\n\"The calm way in which men speak of 'choosing' a wife always amuses me,\"\r\nshe said. \"If any man told me he had 'chosen' me I should feel inclined\r\nto box his ears.\"\r\n\r\n\"It isn't the best of words,\" put in Sturgess promptly, \"but it conveys\r\na real compliment. A fellow meets a girl, _the_ girl, and some\r\nelectrical arrangement jangles at the back of his head. 'This is _it_,'\r\nsays a voice. 'Go to it, good and hard,' and he goes. That's the only\r\nsort of choice he's given. The girl can always turn him down, you know.\r\nStill, she can't help feeling flattered. She says to herself, 'That poor\r\nfellow, Charles K. Sturgess, is only a mutt, but he did think me the\r\nbest ever, so he had good taste.' What do you think, Miss Madge?\"\r\n\r\nThen he and the others discovered that Madge was crying. The frivolous\r\nchatter intended to hide a dread reality had failed in its object. They\r\nwere shivering with cold again, and ever more conscious of gnawing\r\nhunger. The prospect of escape was more than doubtful. Fate seemed to be\r\nplaying a pitiless game with every soul on board the _Southern Cross_,\r\nhaving swept some to instant death, while retaining others for\r\ndestruction by idle whim. The renewed darkness, the continuous uproar\r\nof the reef, had broken the girl's nerve.\r\n\r\nMaseden fancied that he had placed too great a strain on her by\r\ndetailing with such precision the sequence of events during those\r\ncrowded hours at Cartagena.\r\n\r\n\"I think,\" he said gravely, \"that we ought to lie down again, and await\r\npatiently the coming of daylight. The sun rises, no matter what else may\r\nhappen, and dawn cannot be long delayed now.\"\r\n\r\nThey obeyed him. They looked to him for guidance, but they were glad he\r\ndid not call for any effort. Even the light-hearted, apparently\r\nirresponsible Sturgess, who, if he had to die, would depart this life\r\nwith a jest on his lips, was stilled by the sheer hopelessness of their\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nAfter one of those hours which seem to belong to eternity rather than to\r\ntime, a quality of grayness made itself felt in the overwhelming gloom.\r\nSoon the serrated edge of the opposite wall of rock became a fixed and\r\nrigid thing against a background of cloud. In this new world of horror\r\nand suffering the break of day, to all appearances, came from the west!\r\n\r\nThis phenomenon was easily explained. Near by, on the east, rose the\r\ntremendous peaks of the Andes, so the plain of the sea on the western\r\nhorizon caught the first shafts of light long before they filtered into\r\nthe fiords and gorges of the coast-line tucked in at the base of those\r\ngreat hills.\r\n\r\nNot that it mattered a jot to those desolate ones where the sun rose\r\nthat day. They would have given little heed had the earth rolled over on\r\na new axis, and dawn come from the South Pole!\r\n\r\nAs soon as daylight was sufficiently advanced to render the rock\r\nfissures clearly visible, Maseden roused his tiny flock from the stupor\r\nof sheer exhaustion. He was a man born to lead, and the necessity to\r\nspur on and exhort others proved his own salvation. He was stiff and\r\nsore, and his head still ached abominably, but he rose to his feet with\r\nan energetic shout that quickened the blood in his hearers' veins.\r\n\r\n\"Now, folk,\" he said, \"the first order of the day is breakfast, and then\r\nstrike camp!\"\r\n\r\nBreakfast! They thought he was crazy. But he took the bottle of brandy\r\nfrom a crevice in which he had lodged it securely overnight, and\r\nSturgess uttered a cackling laugh.\r\n\r\n\"I'm doing pretty well for a life-long teetotaller,\" he wheezed. \"When a\r\nfellow like me falls off the water-wagon, he generally drops with a dull\r\nthud, but _I_ must have set up a record. After lunching and dining\r\nyesterday on claret, I supped on brandy last night and am about to\r\nbreakfast on the same.... Girls, help yourself and pass the decanter!\"\r\n\r\nMaseden held up the bottle to the light. It had never contained more\r\nthan a pint, and nearly half had gone. A small coin served as a measure\r\nto divide the contents into five portions.\r\n\r\n\"Each of us drinks a _peseta_-worth,\" he said. \"There must be neither\r\nhalf measures nor extra ones. The last _peseta_-worth remains in the\r\nbottle. Is that agreed?\"\r\n\r\n\"I want very little, please,\" said Nina Forbes. \"Just enough to moisten\r\nmy lips and tongue--\"\r\n\r\n\"You're going to do as you're bid,\" was the gruff answer. \"I advise you\r\nto sip your portion, by all means, but you _must_ take it. As a penalty\r\nfor disobedience, you'll start.\"\r\n\r\nShe made no further protest, but swallowed her dose meekly. Sister Madge\r\nfollowed. Sturgess was minded to argue, but met Maseden's dour glance,\r\nand took his share. The first mouthful of the spirit acted on him like\r\nan elixir of life. He drank down to the allotted mark, and handed the\r\nbottle to Maseden.\r\n\r\n\"Now, girls,\" he chortled, \"this is the guy who really needs watching.\r\nIf he doesn't play fair let's heave him into the sea.\"\r\n\r\nSo three pairs of eyes saw to it that their rescuer had his full\r\nallowance. Then the bottle was put away, and the castaways took stock\r\nof their surroundings.\r\n\r\nAt first sight the position was grotesquely disheartening. Beneath, to\r\nthe left, was the sea. Behind them rose an overhanging wall of rock,\r\nwhich swung round to the right and cut off the ledge. The cleft itself\r\nwas some twelve feet wide, and the opposite wall rose fully ten feet. In\r\na word, no chamois or mountain goat could have made the transit.\r\n\r\nThey all surveyed the situation from every point of view afforded by the\r\nfifteen feet of ledge. There was no reason to express opinions. Escape,\r\nin any direction, looked frankly impossible.\r\n\r\nThen Maseden examined the cleft beneath.\r\n\r\n\"We cannot go up,\" he said quietly. \"In that case, as we certainly don't\r\nmean to stay here, I'm going down.\"\r\n\r\nIt was feasible, with care, to climb down to sea level, but the huge\r\nrollers breaking over the reef sent a heavy backwash against the cliff.\r\nThe swirl of water rose and fell three feet at a time, with enough force\r\nto throw the strongest man off his balance.\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean that you intend jumping into the sea, Mr. Maseden?\" said\r\nMadge Forbes.\r\n\r\nShe was quite calm now. She put that vital question as coolly as though\r\nit implied nothing more than a swimmer's pastime. Their eyes clashed,\r\nand, for the first time, the man saw that Madge possessed no small share\r\nof Nina's self-control. Her earlier collapse was of the body, not of the\r\nsoul.\r\n\r\n\"It doesn't mean that I shall willingly commit suicide,\" he answered.\r\n\"If it comes to that, I suggest that we all go together. I'm merely\r\ntaking a prospecting trip. There's no way out above. I must see what\r\noffers below.\"\r\n\r\nWithout another word he sat on the lip of the rock on which they stood,\r\nand lowered himself to a tiny ledge which gave foothold. They watched\r\nhim making his way down. It was no easy climb, but he did not hurry.\r\nTwice he advanced, and climbed a little higher to a point whence descent\r\nwas more practicable. At last he vanished.\r\n\r\nSturgess, craning his neck over the seaward side of their narrow perch,\r\ncould not see him, while the growl of the reef shut out all minor\r\nsounds.\r\n\r\nMaseden was not long absent, but the three people whom he had left\r\nconfessed afterwards that of all the nerve-racking experiences they had\r\nundergone since the ship struck, that silent waiting was the worst.\r\n\r\nAt last he reappeared. Nina, farthest up the cleft, was the first to see\r\nhim, and she cried shrilly:\r\n\r\n\"Oh, thank God! He's got a rope!\"\r\n\r\nA rope! Of what avail was a rope? Yet three hearts thrilled with great\r\nexpectation. Why should Maseden bring a rope? It meant something, some\r\nplan, some definite means towards the one great object. They had an\r\nabounding faith in him.\r\n\r\nThe rope was slung around his shoulders in a noose, and he seemed to be\r\ntugging at some heavy weight which yielded but slowly to the strain.\r\nWhen he was still below the level of the ledge he undid the noose and\r\npassed it to Sturgess.\r\n\r\n\"Hold tight!\" he shouted. \"I've picked up the broken foremast. I'm going\r\ndown to clear it off the rocks. When I yell, haul away steadily.\"\r\n\r\nThey asked no questions. Maseden simply must be right. They listened\r\neagerly for the signal, and put all their strength to the task when it\r\ncame.\r\n\r\nSoon the truck of the foremast appeared. Then the full length of the\r\nspar could be seen, with Maseden guiding it. He had tied the rope at a\r\npoint about one-third of the length from the truck. When it was poised\r\nso that lifting alone was required he shouted to them to stop, and\r\nrejoined them, breathless, but bright-eyed.\r\n\r\n\"There's no means of escape by the sea,\" he explained, \"so we must try\r\nthe cliff. This is our bridge. I think it will span the gully. Anyhow,\r\nit is worth trying.\"\r\n\r\nThen they understood, and measuring glances were cast from spar to\r\nopposing crest. It would be a close thing, but, as Maseden said, it was\r\ncertainly worth trying.\r\n\r\nIn a minute, or less, the broken mast was standing up-ended on the\r\nledge. Then, with its base jammed into a crevice, it was lowered by the\r\nrope across the chasm. It just touched the top of the rock wall.\r\n\r\nThey actually cheered, but the women's hearts missed a couple of beats\r\nwhen Maseden began to climb again. He worked his way upward without\r\nhaste, found a toe-grip on the rock, raised himself carefully, and again\r\ndisappeared from sight.\r\n\r\nThis time he was not so long away. He looked down on them with a\r\nconfident smile.\r\n\r\n\"There's a chance,\" he said. \"A ghost of a chance. Now I'm coming back!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nPROGRESS\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen he stood beside them once more on the ledge he told them what he\r\nhad seen.\r\n\r\n\"It's a fortress of rock up there, and nothing else,\" he said. \"We may\r\nhave to climb at least a couple of hundred feet. Have any of you ever\r\ndone any Alpine work?\"\r\n\r\nNo; they knew nothing of the perils or delights of mountaineering.\r\n\r\n\"I'm in the same boat,\" he confessed, \"but I've read a lot about it, and\r\nI've noticed one thing in our favor--the pitch of the strata is downward\r\ntowards the land, and that kind of rock face gives the best and safest\r\nfoothold. Moreover, this cleft, or fault, seems to continue a long way\r\nup.\r\n\r\n\"Now, we haven't a minute to spare. Each hour will find us weaker. The\r\nweather, too, is clear, and the rock fairly dry, but wind and rain, or\r\nfog, would prove our worst enemies. There is plenty of cordage down\r\nbelow. I'll gather all within reach. It may prove useful.\"\r\n\r\nHe seemed to have no more to say, and was stooping to begin the descent\r\nwhen Sturgess grabbed him by the shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Wait a second, commodore!\" he cried. \"You've got your job cut out, and\r\nI'll obey orders and keep a close tongue, you bet; but when it comes to\r\ncollecting rope lengths, that is _my_ particular stunt, as I sell hemp,\r\namong other things. You just rest up a while.\"\r\n\r\nMaseden nodded, and made way for a willing deputy. It was only fit and\r\nproper that he, too, should conserve his energies.\r\n\r\n\"'Round the corner to the left,\" he said, \"you'll find a sloping rock.\r\nSome wreckage is lodged in an eddy alongside it. Secure the cordage, and\r\nany other odds and ends you think useful. Shin up here with a few rope\r\nlengths at once. I want them straight away. Have you a strong knife?\"\r\n\r\nYes, Sturgess luckily did possess a serviceable knife. By the time he\r\nhad handed over a number of rope strands Maseden, helped by the girls,\r\nhad hauled back the mast, to which he began attaching short loops, or\r\nstirrups, about two feet apart. He did not expect that either Madge\r\nForbes or her sister would be able to climb the mast, and it was almost\r\na sheer impossibility that he and Sturgess should carry them time and\r\nagain. So the mast, after serving twice as a bridge, was now to become a\r\nladder.\r\n\r\nSturgess returned with a curiously mixed spoil--a good deal of rope, a\r\nsou'wester, a long, thin line--probably the whip used to establish the\r\nconnection between bridge and forecastle while parts of the _Southern\r\nCross_ still held together--and the ship's flag, the ensign which was\r\nflying at the poop when the ship struck.\r\n\r\nWater was dripping off him. Evidently he had either been caught by a sea\r\nor had slipped off a rock.\r\n\r\n\"Accident?\" inquired Maseden.\r\n\r\n\"Not quite. I had to risk something to get these,\" and he produced from\r\nhis pockets a dozen large oysters.\r\n\r\nNo party of _gourmets_ ever sat down to a feast with greater zest than\r\nthose four hungry people. Probably, in view of the labors and hardships\r\nthey were yet fated to undergo, the oysters saved their lives. There is\r\nno knowing. Human endurance can be stretched to surprising limits, but,\r\nseeing that they were destined to taste no other food during twelve long\r\nhours of arduous exertion, the value of Sturgess's find can hardly be\r\noverrated.\r\n\r\nThe oysters were of a really excellent species, though under the\r\ncircumstances they were sure to be palatable, no matter what their\r\nactual qualities.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose I need hardly ask if there are any more to be had?\" inquired\r\nMaseden, when the meal was dispatched.\r\n\r\n\"No, sir,\" grinned Sturgess.\r\n\r\nHe left it at that, but the others realized that he had probably risked\r\nhis life more than once in the effort to secure even that modest supply.\r\n\r\nThe meal, slight though it was, not only gave them a new strength--it\r\nbrought hope. If only they could win a way to the interior, and reach\r\nthe land-locked waters of the bay which opened up behind the frowning\r\nbarrier they must yet scale, in all likelihood they would at least\r\nobtain a plentiful store of shell-fish.\r\n\r\nNina Forbes uttered a quaint little laugh as she threw the last empty\r\nshell on to the rocks beneath.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" she said, \"I am quite ready for the soup and a joint.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, don't be horrid!\" cried Madge. \"You've gone and made me feel\r\nravenous again.\"\r\n\r\n\"He, or she, who would eat must first labor,\" said Maseden. \"Thanks to\r\nfriend Sturgess, we've enjoyed a first-rate snack. I've never sampled\r\nmanna, but I'll back the proteids in three fat oysters against those in\r\na pound of manna any day. Now, let's get to business. If I'm not\r\nmistaken we're going to tackle a stiff proposition.\"\r\n\r\nHe knotted some stout cord around his own waist and that of each of the\r\nothers, and slung the longest available coil over his shoulders. Then\r\nthe mast was fixed in its place across the ravine, and he climbed to the\r\nopposite crest by straddling the pole, putting his feet in the loops,\r\nand pulling himself up by both hands.\r\n\r\nThrowing back the rope, he told Sturgess to see that it was fastened\r\nsecurely to one of the girls on the belt already in position. He\r\npurposely refrained from specifying which one. By chance, Madge Forbes\r\nstood nearest, and it was she who came.\r\n\r\nThe crossing was awkward rather than dangerous, and rendered far more\r\ndifficult by the fact that the unwilling acrobat was compelled to expose\r\nher naked limbs. But after the first shock common sense came to her aid,\r\nand she straightway abandoned any useless effort to observe the\r\nconventions.\r\n\r\nStill, she blushed furiously, and was trembling when Maseden caught her\r\nhands and helped her to land.\r\n\r\n\"Thank Heaven we've kept our boots,\" he said, unfastening the rope.\r\n\"Just look at the ground we have to cover, and think what it would mean\r\nif our feet were bare.\"\r\n\r\nThe comment was merely one of those matter-of-fact bits of philosophy\r\nwhich are most effective in the major crises of life. It was so\r\ntrue that a display of leg or ankle mattered little afterwards.\r\nNevertheless, a similar ordeal caused Nina to blush, too, but she\r\nlaughed when Madge cried ruefully:\r\n\r\n\"What in the world has happened to my ankles? They are scrubbed and\r\nbruised dreadfully.\"\r\n\r\n\"That was last night's treatment, my dear,\" said her sister. \"I escaped\r\nmore lightly than you.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what do you mean? I felt some soreness, but imagined I knocked\r\nmyself in coming from the wreck.\"\r\n\r\n\"You were in a dead faint, so Mr. Maseden and Mr. Sturgess massaged you\r\nunmercifully.\"\r\n\r\nMadge surveyed damages again.\r\n\r\n\"I must have been very bad if I stood that,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"You'll be worse before we see the other side of this cliff,\" murmured\r\nNina, casting a critical eye over the precipitous ground in front.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be wondered at if the girls' hearts quailed at the sight.\r\nThey were standing on a sloping terrace, of no great depth, which ended\r\nabruptly at the foot of a towering cliff. A little to the right ran\r\nthe line of the cleft, but so forbidding was its appearance, and so\r\napparently unscalable its broken ledges, that the same thought occurred\r\nto each--what if they had but left a narrow, sheltered prison for a\r\nwider and more exposed one?\r\n\r\nMaseden, however, allowed no time for reflection. He and Sturgess had\r\nalready dragged the foremast after them, and were shouldering it in the\r\ndirection of the first hump of rock which seemed to offer a way into the\r\ncleft. Any other route was absolutely impossible.\r\n\r\nAfter one last glance at the reef which had slain a gallant ship and so\r\nmany lives, they quitted the ledge which had proved their salvation. It\r\nwas then five o'clock in the morning. At four o'clock that afternoon\r\nthey flung themselves, utterly spent, on a carpet of thick moss which\r\ncoated the landward slope of the most westerly point of Hanover Island.\r\n\r\nTheir hands and knees were torn and bleeding, their fingernails broken,\r\ntheir bones aching and their eyes bloodshot. But they had triumphed,\r\nthough many a time it had seemed that if Providence meant to be kind,\r\nan avalanche of loose stones or a slip on treacherous shale would have\r\nhurled them to speedy death on the rocks beneath.\r\n\r\nOn five separate occasions they had found themselves strung out on\r\na narrow ledge which merged to nothingness in the sheer wall of a\r\nprecipice. Five times had they to go back and essay a different path,\r\noften beginning again fifty or even a hundred feet below the point they\r\nhad reached. They were obliged to drag or carry the heavy topmast every\r\ninch of the way, because, without its aid, either as a bridge or a\r\nladder, they could never have surmounted a tithe of the obstacles\r\nencountered.\r\n\r\nIn those eleven awful hours they had climbed not two, but five hundred\r\nfeet, a distance which, on the level, a good runner would traverse in\r\nabout twenty seconds, whereas it took them an average of a minute to\r\nclimb one foot.\r\n\r\nThe marvel was that the women could have done it at all, even with the\r\nhelp which both men gave unstintedly. During the last weary hours no one\r\nuttered an unnecessary word. Each of the four was determined to go on,\r\nnot for his or her own sake, but for the sake of the others. They were\r\nroped together. If one fell, it meant disaster to all. So, with splendid\r\ngrit, each resolved not to fall so long as hand would hold or foot lodge\r\non the tiniest projection.\r\n\r\nBut, with final success, came utter collapse. Even Maseden, far stronger\r\nphysically than Sturgess, fell like a log. True, he had borne far more\r\nthan his share of the day's toil. No matter what his inmost thoughts, he\r\nhad never, to outward seeming, lost heart. It was he who always found\r\nthe new line, he who earliest decided to turn back and try again.\r\n\r\nIt was he, too, who called now for renewed exertion after some minutes\r\nof complete and blissful repose.\r\n\r\n\"Sorry to disturb your _siesta_,\" he cried, with a woful assumption of\r\ncheery confidence, \"but we must reach the shore, if possible, before\r\nnight falls. Oysters and Chablis await us there. _En avant, messieurs et\r\n'dames!_\"\r\n\r\nNina Forbes sat up and brushed the hair from her eyes.\r\n\r\n\"I don't think I can walk another yard. Won't you leave me here?\" she\r\ndemanded.\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are we to carry that mast with us?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not? We may need it.\"\r\n\r\nHer eyes followed Maseden's down the slope. Compared with the sullen,\r\nfrowning realm of rock they had quitted, this eastern side of the island\r\nresembled a Paradise. The moss on which they were resting was thick and\r\nwiry. A hundred feet beneath were fir-trees, sparse and stunted at\r\nfirst, but soon growing luxuriantly, yet promising, to Maseden's\r\nweighing eye, a barrier nearly as formidable as the fearsome wall of\r\nrock they had just surmounted.\r\n\r\nHe knew that which was happily hidden from the others. In this wild\r\nland, seldom, if ever, trodden by the foot of man, the forests throve on\r\nthe bones of their own dead progenitors. Aged trees fell and rotted\r\nwhere they lay, and the roots of newcomers found substance among the\r\nheaped-up logs. Gales and landslides helped to swell the mad jumble of\r\ndecaying trunks, which formed an impassable layer hardly ever less than\r\nfifteen feet in depth and often going beyond thirty feet.\r\n\r\nOf the two, Maseden believed he would sooner tackle another wall of rock\r\nrather than essay to cross that belt of fantastic growths.\r\n\r\nBut, down there was water--perhaps food--certainly shelter. He guessed\r\nthat at an altitude where hardy Alpine mosses alone flourished the cold\r\nwould be intense at night. Already there was a shrewd nip in the breeze.\r\nThey must not dawdle another instant.\r\n\r\nHe made up his mind to head for a gap in the trees which seemed to mark\r\na recent land-slip, and trust to fortune that the gradient might not be\r\ntoo steep. Better any open risk than the fall of perhaps the whole party\r\ninto a pit of dead wood choked with foetid and noisome fungus growths.\r\nOnce caught in such a trap, they might never emerge.\r\n\r\nAnd now they met with their greatest among many pieces of luck that day.\r\nThe opening Maseden had noticed was not the track of an avalanche, but a\r\nrough water-course, through which the torrential rain-storms of the\r\ncoast tumbled headlong to the sea.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the long-continued gale, the descent was so steep that\r\nonly a vestige of a stream trickled down the main gully. Here and there\r\nlay a pool. Though the water was brackish, it was strongly pigmented\r\nwith iron, and the roots of vigorous young trees seemed to find\r\nsustenance in it.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, they must drink or die, so they drank, though Maseden\r\nwarned them to be moderate. They laved their wounds, which were\r\nintensely sore at first, owing to the encrustation of salt on their\r\nskins. But here, again, nature's surgery, if painful, was effective.\r\nSalt is a rough and ready antiseptic. None of them owned any real\r\nmedical knowledge. In their hard case ignorance was surely bliss,\r\nbecause they must have had the narrowest of escapes from tetanus.\r\n\r\nThe descent, though trying, was not specially perilous. Three times did\r\nthe mast bring them down small cataracts, and many times across\r\nextraordinarily ingenious log barriers, set up against the stress of\r\nfalling water by nature's own engineering methods.\r\n\r\nOnce, indeed, a heavy boulder, poised in unexpected balance, toppled\r\nover just as they had reached the base of a waterfall. It would have\r\ncrushed Nina Forbes to a pulp had not Maseden seen the stone move. As it\r\nwas, he snatched her aside, and a ton of rock crashed harmlessly on to\r\nthe very spot where she had been standing the fifth part of a second\r\nearlier.\r\n\r\nSuch an incident, happening in civilized surroundings, would have been\r\nregarded as phenomenal, something akin to an escape from a train wreck.\r\nHere it passed as a mere item in the day's trials. It did not even shake\r\nthe girl's nerve.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose I ought to say 'thank you,' but I'm not quite sure you have\r\ndone me a service,\" she murmured wearily.\r\n\r\nHitherto both she and her sister had been so brave, so uncomplaining,\r\nthat Maseden took warning from the words. The two girls were at the\r\nextreme limit of their powers of endurance, mentally and physically. It\r\nwas five o'clock in the evening. After a day and a night of passive\r\nmisery they had been subjected to every sort of muscular strain during\r\nnearly twelve hours, and might collapse at any moment now.\r\n\r\n\"Courage!\" he said, with a gentleness curiously in contrast with the\r\nrather gruff and hectoring manner he had adopted all day. \"You haven't\r\nnoticed how near the sea is. We shall be on shore in a few minutes.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl's lips parted in a wan smile.\r\n\r\n\"You are wonderful,\" was all she said, but the pathos underlying the\r\ntribute wrung his heart.\r\n\r\nSomehow, anyhow, they slithered and dropped down the remaining steps of\r\ntheir Calvary. During the last few feet they were able to leave behind\r\nthe friendly topmast, but the shadows were falling when they stood,\r\nforlornly triumphant, on the flat rocks which served as the beach of\r\nthe estuary.\r\n\r\nThe two girls sank at once to a moss-covered boulder. They looked so\r\ndeathly white beneath the tan of exposure and the crust of dirt and\r\nblood not altogether removed when they bathed their faces in the pool,\r\nthat Maseden unstrapped the poncho which he carried slung to his\r\nshoulders and produced from its folds that thrice-precious bottle of\r\nbrandy.\r\n\r\nThe patients weakly resisted his demand that they should share nearly\r\nthe whole of the mouthful of spirit which remained; but he was firm, and\r\nthey drank. Sturgess, who staggered and nearly fell when he tried to\r\nmove after the brief halt, was given a few drops; Maseden himself had\r\nwhat was left. Then he filled the bottle with water, and each took a\r\nlong drink.\r\n\r\nThere is this supreme virtue in water, that, while slaking thirst, it\r\nstays the worst pangs of hunger, and Maseden had enough strength in\r\nreserve to hurry off in search of oysters, or any sort of shell-fish,\r\nbefore daylight failed wholly. He was fortunate in finding a\r\nwell-stocked bed almost at once.\r\n\r\nHe alone knew what agony he endured when his bruised and torn fingers\r\nwere plunged into ice-cold salt water. But he persevered, and gathered\r\nsuch a quantity that in ten minutes he and his companions were enjoying\r\na really satisfying meal.\r\n\r\nWhile they ate, they examined their surroundings. It was half tide. A\r\nbleak, rocky foreshore provided at least an ideal breeding-ground for\r\noysters. Behind them rose the solemn bank of pine-trees through which\r\nthey had come. On the right, only half a mile away, stood the great\r\nshoulder of rock which shut out the Pacific on that northern side of the\r\nestuary. In front, two miles or more distant, lay a jumble of forests\r\nand wild hills, and a similar vista spread far to the left, because the\r\nestuary widened to a span of several miles.\r\n\r\nIt was, indeed, a wild, desolate, awe-inspiring land, a territory\r\nabandoned of mankind! In such regions old-time sailors found fearsome\r\nmonsters, amphibious reptiles larger than ships, and gnomes of demoniac\r\naspect.\r\n\r\nSuch visions were easy to conjure up. Nina Forbes saw one now in the\r\ndusk.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, what is that?\" she cried, in genuine alarm, gazing seaward with\r\nterror-laden eyes.\r\n\r\nIt took some time to unmask the strange denizen of the deep which she\r\nhad discovered. Three seals, lying in a row on a flat rock, looked\r\nremarkably like the accepted pictures of a sea-serpent, but the illusion\r\nwas destroyed when one of the creatures dived, followed, in turn, by\r\neach of the others, in one, two, three order.\r\n\r\n\"We must rise before dawn to-morrow,\" said Maseden. \"Seals are good to\r\neat. You and I, Sturgess, can cut one off when the pack comes on shore.\"\r\n\r\n\"Seals may be good to eat, but they will also be hard to eat if we are\r\nunable to cook them,\" put in Madge.\r\n\r\n\"There were times to-day when I could have eaten seal cooked or\r\nuncooked,\" admitted Nina.\r\n\r\n\"Probably such times will recur to-morrow,\" said Maseden. \"You will soon\r\ngrow tired of oysters for every meal. Did you ever hear of the sailing\r\nship which took a cargo of bottled porter from Dublin to Cape Town?\r\nAfter crossing the line she was caught in a gale, disabled, and carried\r\nhundreds of miles out of her course. She ran short of water, so, during\r\nthree wretched weeks, officers and crew drank stout for breakfast,\r\ndinner and supper. When, at last, the vessel reached Table Bay, if\r\nporter was suggested as a beverage to any member of the ship's company\r\nthere was instant trouble.\"\r\n\r\n\"Still,\" said Madge thoughtfully, \"I don't think I shall like raw\r\nseal.... You are very clever, Mr. Maseden. You must find some means of\r\nmaking a fire.\"\r\n\r\nMaseden glanced up at the darkening sky.\r\n\r\n\"At present the pressing problem is where are we to sleep,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Under the deodars,\" suggested Sturgess promptly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I suppose so. But we must make haste.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you ask me to put up any sort of hustle, I'll crack into small\r\nfragments,\" said Sturgess, rising to his feet slowly and stiffly.\r\n\r\nBut this young American--a typical New Yorker in every inch--was blessed\r\nwith a valiant heart. He helped Maseden to break and cut small branches\r\nof the fragrant pines, and pile them beneath the largest tree they could\r\nfind on a comparatively level piece of ground above high-water mark. The\r\ntwo girls were half carried to this soft couch, which invited sharp\r\ncomparison with the wet, slimy rock of the previous night.\r\n\r\nDespite their protests, they were wrapped in the now dry ship's flag and\r\nthe poncho, while the men covered themselves with the oilskins, the coat\r\nwhich Sturgess had found on the reef coming in very useful for Maseden.\r\n\r\nThen they slept. And how they slept! The mere fact that they had eaten a\r\nquantity of good food induced utter weariness and exhaustion.\r\n\r\nDuring the night it rained heavily, and the tide pounded fiercely on the\r\nboulders only a few feet below their resting-place. But they hardly\r\nmoved, and certainly paid no heed.\r\n\r\nMaseden was awakened by a veritable cascade of water on his face; the\r\ntree, after the manner of its kind, though shooting the rain generally\r\noff its layers of branches, now in full summer foliage, provided\r\noccasional channels through which the torrent poured as from a spout,\r\nand he was stretched beneath one. He swore softly, saw that the others\r\nwere undisturbed, moved his position slightly, and fell sound asleep\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nAs for rising betimes to catch a seal, it was broad daylight when he\r\nshook off the almost overpowering desire to go on sleeping.\r\n\r\nNina and Madge were lying in each other's arms, breathing easily, and\r\nlooking extraordinarily well. Beyond them, Sturgess lay like a log, his\r\nclean-cut, somewhat cynical features relaxed in a smile. It was a pity\r\nto rouse him, but Maseden saw by his watch that they had enjoyed nine\r\nhours of real repose, and, as the weather was fine again and there was a\r\npromise of sunshine, it behooved them to be up and doing.\r\n\r\nSo he shook his compatriot gently by the shoulder, and Sturgess was\r\nawake instantly.\r\n\r\n\"Gosh!\" he said, gazing at a patch of blue sky overhead. \"I was just\r\nordering clams on ice in Louis Martin's. It must have been a memory of\r\nthose oysters.\"\r\n\r\nMaseden, by a gesture, warned him not to speak loudly, whereupon\r\nSturgess sat up, saw the two girls, grinned, and stole quietly after\r\nhis companion.\r\n\r\n\"Say,\" he confided, when at a safe distance, \"they're the limit, aren't\r\nthey?\"\r\n\r\n\"They're all right, so far as girls go,\" agreed Maseden.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, come off your perch! Who ever loved that loved not at first sight?\r\nIf we win through I'm going to marry Madge, or I'll know the reason why,\r\nand if you have half the gumption we credit you with you'll tack on to\r\nsister Nina as soon as you've shunted that sporty young person who\r\ngrabbed you at the cannon's mouth in Cartagena.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you oblige me by not talking such damn nonsense?\" growled Maseden,\r\nblazing into sudden and incomprehensible wrath.\r\n\r\n\"Calm yourself, _hidalgo_!\" came the quiet answer. \"Sorry if I've butted\r\nin on your private affairs. Having fixed things for myself, I thought\r\nI'd do you a good turn, too. That's all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you realize that you are hardly playing the game by even hinting\r\nat such possibilities in present conditions?\"\r\n\r\nMaseden regretted the words the instant they were uttered. Sturgess\r\nstopped as though he had been struck, and his somewhat sallow face\r\nflushed darkly.\r\n\r\n\"It will be a pretty mean business if you and I manage to quarrel, won't\r\nit?\" he said thickly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nA PEEP INTO THE FUTURE\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Oh, forget it!\" cried Maseden, more angry now with himself than with\r\nthe youngster whose candor had provoked this outburst. \"I didn't intend\r\nto be offensive. My mind was running on the day's worries. We're in a\r\ndeuce of a fix, and I can see no way out of it. If I annoyed you by a\r\ncareless expression, I apologize.\"\r\n\r\n\"Rub it off the slate, friend. I only want to put in a first bid for\r\nMadge, so to speak.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, for all you know, she may be--engaged to some other man,\" Maseden\r\ncould not help retorting.\r\n\r\n\"Nix on the other fellow. He's not on in this film. I'll have him beaten\r\nto a frazzle long before I see good old New York again.\"\r\n\r\nThen Maseden did contrive to choke back the very obvious comment that\r\nMadge Forbes might even be married already. Sufficient for the day was\r\nthe problem thereof. It was not matrimony that was bothering him, though\r\nthe queer marriage tie contracted in San Juan seemed fated to make its\r\nfetters felt even in the wilderness. He was wondering what would happen\r\nif, as was highly probable, they were marooned on an island rarely if\r\never visited by man.\r\n\r\nHe laughed grimly.\r\n\r\n\"New York is away below the horizon this morning,\" he said. \"Let's go\r\nand hunt more oysters!\"\r\n\r\nStill, for the life of him he could not altogether get rid of the\r\nspectre raised by Sturgess's almost banal candor. The New Yorker was\r\nunmistakably a good fellow. He had behaved like a man during twenty-four\r\nhours which tested one's moral fibre as pure metal is separated from\r\ndross in a furnace. Was it quite fair that he should be kept in\r\nignorance of the astounding fact that Madge Forbes, and none other, was\r\nthe heroine of that extraordinary ceremony in the Castle of San Juan?\r\n\r\nWhy not tell him? There was every reason to believe that he had indulged\r\nin no overt love-making as yet. Why not emulate his outspokenness, and\r\nthus spare him the certain shock of discovery?\r\n\r\nMoreover, when the truth came out, would he not feel with justice that\r\nhe had been very badly treated both by Maseden and the woman whom he\r\nprofessed to love?\r\n\r\nMaseden squirmed under the thought. Such a discussion, at such a moment,\r\nsavored of rank lunacy, but it was better to act crazily than\r\ndishonorably.\r\n\r\nThen came a reflection that hurt like a cut from a jagged knife.\r\nSturgess was an impressionable youngster. He might easily transfer his\r\nwooing from Madge to Nina.\r\n\r\nMaseden could not help asking himself why a torturing question of that\r\nkind should come to plague him at a time when their lives were in dire\r\njeopardy. They might, by chance, exist a week, a month--several months\r\nin that dreadful fastness of rock, forest and sea, but the briefest\r\nglance towards the interior showed how desperate was their case, and he\r\nknew only too well that the absence of proper food, of fire, of\r\nclothing, of everything that renders life tolerable and joyous, would\r\nsoon bring mortal sickness in its train, even though they ran the\r\ngantlet of other perils like unto those of yesterday.\r\n\r\nWhy, he wondered, in addition to ending these present evils, should he\r\nbe called on to solve a fine point in ethics?\r\n\r\nHe did not realize how clearly the torment in his soul was revealed in\r\nhis face until Sturgess demanded cheerfully:\r\n\r\n\"What's worrying you now, boss? You ain't chewing on that little\r\nmisunderstanding of a minute ago, are you?\"\r\n\r\nMaseden smiled dourly. Here was an opening, and he would take it, no\r\nmatter what the personal cost.\r\n\r\n\"No. That is not my way,\" he said. \"I was merely turning over in my mind\r\na somewhat ticklish problem. Sometimes, when a man does not know how to\r\nact for the best, it is not a bad plan to run counter to one's own\r\ninclinations. Then, at any rate, there is no fear of selfishness warping\r\none's judgment. In this instance--\"\r\n\r\n\"Is the tide rising or falling?\" interrupted Sturgess excitedly.\r\n\r\n\"Falling.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good.... What's that?\"\r\n\r\nThey were walking in the direction of the oyster bed which Maseden had\r\nfound overnight. The beach was strewn with boulders, the surface of each\r\na mosaic of myriads of tiny mussels. The rock floor was not quite flat,\r\nbut dipped slightly eastward, and the outcrop of every stratum, worn\r\nsmooth by countless tides, offered a number of irregular paths by which\r\nit was possible to walk dry-shod a mile or more towards mid-channel.\r\n\r\nBetween these tracks, so to speak, the water lodged in pools, and here,\r\ntoo, as might be expected, the smaller rocks gathered, mostly in groups.\r\n\r\nAmong one such pile Sturgess's sharp eyes had detected some wreckage.\r\n\r\nNow, any sort of flotsam or jetsam might be peculiarly useful to folk\r\nwhose belongings had been reduced to a cloak, a ship's flag, a few\r\noilskins, and, in the case of the women, little else. The sight of a\r\ncabin trunk, up-ended among a litter of woodwork and tangled iron, drove\r\ninto the special Limbo provided for all vain and foolish things the\r\npersonal difficulty which was perplexing Maseden.\r\n\r\nHe hurried on, and soon was aware of an oddly familiar aspect about the\r\ntrunk, battered though it was, and discolored by long immersion in salt\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n\"Well, if this isn't something like a miracle!\" he cried when he could\r\nbelieve his senses. \"Here is my own trunk! The last time I saw it, it\r\nwas wedged between the forecastle deck and the iron frame of a bunk.\"\r\n\r\n\"The court accepts the evidence,\" chortled Sturgess. \"We find in close\r\nconjunction the remains of a bunk and a deck. If you produce a key, and\r\nunlock the aforesaid trunk, it will be declared yours without further\r\ninquiry.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no key. It is only strapped.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's inside?\"\r\n\r\n\"Some underclothing, socks and shirts.... By Jove! When dried, they will\r\nbe invaluable to those two girls.... How in the world did they contrive\r\nto lose most of their clothing? You were all fully dressed when the\r\nship struck, I suppose?\"\r\n\r\n\"I guess your college class didn't include a course of heavy seas\r\nwashing through a deck-house every half minute during a whole day. What\r\nsort of feminine rig would stand the tearing rush of tons of water hour\r\nafter hour? Man alive, I had the devil's own job to keep any of my own\r\nclothes on, and would never have succeeded if I wasn't well buttoned up\r\nin an oilskin. As for the girls' skirts and things, they simply fell off\r\n'em. At first they made frantic efforts to save a few rags, but they had\r\nto give up. I saw Madge's skirt washed overboard in strips. All the\r\nseams parted. I'm in pretty bad shape myself. Look here.\"\r\n\r\nSturgess opened his oilskin coat, and showed how the lining had fallen\r\nout of his coat and the back had parted from the front of his waistcoat.\r\n\r\n\"If it hadn't been for the oilskins we would all have been stripped\r\nstark naked,\" he went on. \"Gee! It's marvelous what one can withstand in\r\nthe shape of exposure when one is pushed to it good and hard. I should\r\nhave said that those two girls would have died fourteen times on the\r\nwreck, let alone the hour before dawn yesterday.\"\r\n\r\nMaseden, meanwhile, was pulling the trunk free from the twisted frame of\r\nthe bunk, which, screwed to the deck, had carried a precious argosy\r\nnearly a mile from the reef; then, most luckily, it had caught in a\r\nclump of seaweed, and remained anchored during two ebbs.\r\n\r\n\"We needn't bother to open it here,\" he said. \"I know exactly what is\r\ninside--rough stuff, bought to maintain my disguise as a _vaquero_, but\r\nall the better for present purposes.\"\r\n\r\nHe paused dramatically, and said something which might, perhaps, sound\r\nbetter in Spanish. When a man who has not been perturbed in the least\r\ndegree by grave and imminent danger shows signs of real excitement, his\r\nemotion is apt to be contagious, and his companion's eyes sparkled.\r\n\r\n\"Holy gee! What is it?\" he almost yelped. \"Spit it out! Don't mind me!\"\r\n\r\n\"This trunk contains a gun and cartridges!\"\r\n\r\n\"Gosh! I thought it must be either a steam launch or an aeroplane! What\r\nis there to shoot, anyhow?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you understand? Waterproof cartridges mean fire. We'll have a\r\nroaring fire within five minutes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Put it there!\" shouted Sturgess, holding out his right hand. \"There's\r\nmillions of tons of iron-stone in that hill above the wood. Let's start\r\na ship-yard!\"\r\n\r\nThey were so elated that they forgot to gather any oysters, and even\r\nneglected to take away the iron and wires of the bunk, scraps of metal\r\nwhich might prove of inestimable worth in the days to come. Luckily,\r\nhowever, they had plenty of time, because the tide would fall during\r\nanother couple of hours.\r\n\r\nMaseden's hands almost trembled as he undid the straps. Now that fortune\r\nhad proved so kind he feared lest the cartridges might be spoiled. But a\r\nbullet torn from a brass case was followed by grains of dry, black\r\npowder.\r\n\r\nSoon he had manufactured a squib. Dead branches off the pines--always\r\nthe best of fire-wood, and far preferable to dead wood lying on the\r\nground--were heaped in a suitable place, and, in less than the specified\r\nfive minutes, a good fire was crackling merrily.\r\n\r\nThere were logs in plenty. Had they chosen, the two men could have built\r\na furnace fierce enough to roast an ox whole.\r\n\r\nIt was good to see the wonderment on the faces of Madge and Nina when\r\nthey awoke to find an array of coarse flax and woolen garments steaming\r\nin front of the blaze, and a dozen big oysters, cooked in the shells,\r\nawaiting each of them. About that time, too, the sun appeared, and his\r\nfirst rays changed the temperature of the land-locked estuary from\r\nbiting cold to an agreeable warmth.\r\n\r\nSo the four breakfasted, and, at the close of the meal, held a council\r\nof war. With a charred stick, Maseden drew on a rock a rough map of\r\nHanover Island.\r\n\r\n\"I overheard from one of the crew of the _Southern Cross_,\" he said,\r\n\"that the ship was supposed to be drifting towards Nelson Straits, which\r\nis the only opening into Smyth's Channel ever attempted hereabouts, even\r\nin fine weather, by small sealers and guano-boats. Now, it happens,\" he\r\nwent on reflectively, \"that this coast has always had a strange\r\nfascination for me.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was a treat to see you clinging to it lovingly for hours at a time\r\nyesterday,\" put in Sturgess.\r\n\r\n\"We want to hear what Mr. Maseden has to say,\" cried Madge sharply.\r\n\r\n\"Sorry. I shan't interrupt again. But, before the court resumes may I\r\nthrow in a small suggestion? How about dropping these formal Misters and\r\nMisses? My front names are Charles Knight, usually shorted by my friends\r\nand admirers into C. K. What's yours, Maseden?\"\r\n\r\n\"Philip Alexander, otherwise 'Alec.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Got you. Now, girls, what do Nina and Madge stand for?\"\r\n\r\nHe little guessed the explosive quality of that harmless question, but\r\nhe did wonder why both Nina and Madge should blush furiously, and why\r\ntheir eyes should flash a species of appeal to Maseden.\r\n\r\nNina was the first to recover her composure.\r\n\r\n\"Nina and Madge should serve all ordinary purposes, C. K.,\" she said\r\nwith a rather nervous laugh.\r\n\r\n\"They'll do fine,\" agreed Sturgess. But he did not forget his own\r\nsurprise--and the cause of it.\r\n\r\nMaseden, quite unprepared for this verbal bombshell, plunged into\r\ngeneralities somewhat hurriedly.\r\n\r\n\"Barring the polar regions, the southern part of Chile is the wildest\r\nand least known part of the world,\" he said. \"It is extraordinary in the\r\nfact that every ship which sails to the west coast of both the Americas\r\nfrom Europe, and vice versa, either passes it in the Pacific or winds\r\namong its islands for hundreds of miles along Smyth's Channel; yet it\r\nremains, for the greater part, unexplored and almost uncharted. Darwin\r\ncame here in the _Beagle_, and the sailor to-day depends on observations\r\nmade during that voyage, taken nearly three-quarters of a century ago.\r\nDarwin's Journal, and other of his works containing references to South\r\nAmerica, shortened many an evening for me on the ranch.\"\r\n\r\nHe paused a moment, before adding, in an explanatory way:\r\n\r\n\"My place, Los Andes, was a good twelve miles from Cartagena, and I had\r\nno English-speaking neighbors. I told you last night, if you remember,\r\nhow I came to settle down there?\"\r\n\r\nSturgess, though evidently burning to ask a question, merely nodded,\r\ngrinning cheerfully when he caught Nina's eye.\r\n\r\n\"I only want you to understand why I claim some knowledge, such as it\r\nis, of this locality,\" continued Maseden. \"At the southwest corner of\r\nHanover Island is a ten-mile patch called Cambridge Island, and the two\r\nform the northern boundary of Nelson Straits. But in the channel between\r\nthem are two smaller islands, and, unless I am greatly mistaken, there\r\nthey are.\"\r\n\r\nHe pointed across the estuary, and indicated a break in the coast-line,\r\nbeyond which other more distant hills were visible.\r\n\r\n\"It follows,\" he went on, \"that when we sail up this channel to the\r\nleft, we shall find ourselves in Nelson Straits, and, after covering\r\nfifty or sixty miles of fairly open water--open, that is, in the sense\r\nthat there is plenty of it--we shall be in Smyth's Channel, and in the\r\ntrack of passing ships.\"\r\n\r\nHe paused, but did not try to ignore the plain demand legible on three\r\nintent faces.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; that is the only way,\" he said quietly. \"We are here. We are\r\nalive. There is plenty of wood, and we have brains, hands, and fire. We\r\nmust construct some sort of a raft, something in the style of the\r\nlumber-rafts built on big rivers, and take advantage of the tides. Our\r\npresent position is quite inaccessible by land, and, I fear, equally\r\nunapproachable by water.\r\n\r\n\"And I'll tell you why I think so. Within quarter of a mile of us are\r\nsome splendid oyster-beds. The coastal aborigines live mainly on\r\nshell-fish, and this store would have been visited by them times out of\r\nnumber if they could get at it. But I have seen no heaps of shells, such\r\nas must have remained if the savages came here.\r\n\r\n\"What has stopped them? Impassable forests, glaciers, and precipices on\r\nland, dangerous reefs and fierce tidal currents by sea. The geological\r\nfeature which helped our climb yesterday must create reef after reef\r\nacross the track of the channel.\r\n\r\n\"You see those pathways there?\" and he stretched a hand towards the\r\nseries of rock outcrops lining the shore like groins. \"They have been\r\nalmost leveled by the storms of centuries. But the _Southern Cross_ was\r\nlost on one of them, and there must be scores of others between here and\r\nSmyth's Channel. There may be passages between many if not all, but it\r\nis self-evident that navigation is far too risky for the small coracles\r\nof the natives. We must go slowly and safely, if possible. If our raft\r\nwill not cross a reef, we must abandon it, and build another on the far\r\nside. We may have to do that six times, a dozen times, even in sixty\r\nmiles. There is no other means of escape. We may be weeks, months, in\r\nwinning through, but that is our only practicable plan.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gee!\" murmured Sturgess. \"And I'm due in New York on February 10!\"\r\n\r\nThe sheer absurdity of naming a date relaxed the tension. They all\r\nlaughed, though not with the light-hearted mirth which four young people\r\nmight reasonably display after dodging death continuously during\r\ntwenty-four hours.\r\n\r\n\"By the way, what day is it?\" inquired Nina Forbes wistfully.\r\n\r\n\"Sunday, January 23,\" said Sturgess. \"I know, because it was my birthday\r\nyesterday. Somewhere about eleven o'clock a. m., I was twenty-seven. I\r\ndidn't make a fuss about it. Just at that time, wise Alec here was\r\nholding on to a rock by his teeth and one toe, and telling us we had to\r\ngo back carefully after a beastly difficult climb.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sunday!\" repeated the girl.\r\n\r\nHer thoughts traveled many a thousand miles to the quiet little New\r\nJersey township where her mother was living during the absence of\r\nhusband and daughters in South America. It was winter in the North, and\r\nthere might be snow on the fields and ice on the streams, but snow and\r\nice conforming to New Jersey notions of order and seemliness.\r\n\r\nWhat a contrast between the white mantle marked out in rectangles by the\r\ncountry roads and ditches, with here and there a group of trees, a trim\r\nshrubbery, a red-roofed farm or dwelling house, and this chaos of rock,\r\nforest, cliff and ocean!\r\n\r\n\"Will the loss of the _Southern Cross_ be reported?\" she asked suddenly.\r\nThe query was addressed to no one in particular, but Maseden answered.\r\n\r\n\"Her non-arrival will be noted at Punta Arenas,\" he said. \"After a time\r\nthe insurance people will post her as 'missing.' Then she will be\r\nassumed to be lost. Possibly some of the wreckage may be picked up. Or a\r\nboat. What became of all the boats?\"\r\n\r\n\"Some of 'em were stove in, others washed clean off their davits,\" said\r\nSturgess. \"It was absolutely impossible to lower one. No one who did not\r\nwitness it would have believed that a fine ship could break to pieces so\r\nquickly. Gee whiz! One minute I was standing near the fore-rail, looking\r\nat the narrowing entrance in full confidence that we should win through,\r\nand the next I was fighting for my life in the smoking-room, up to my\r\nwaist in water.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are not quite doing yourself justice, C. K.,\" said Madge. \"You were\r\nfighting for other people's lives as well. I have the clearest\r\nrecollection of being hauled up the companion ladder to the bridge by\r\nyou and one of the ship's officers. Then you went back and helped Nina\r\nand Mr. Gray.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is what I was there for,\" was the prompt reply.\r\n\r\n\"This being Sunday, do we labor or rest, Alec?\" inquired Nina.\r\n\r\nIt was the first time either girl had used Maseden's Christian name, and\r\nthe sound on a woman's lips was like a caress. He reddened, and smiled.\r\nNina's eyes met his, and dropped confusedly.\r\n\r\n\"We rest,\" he said. \"We need rest. At least, I am free to confess that\r\n_I_ do. You energetic people are inclined to forget that I began a\r\nreally strenuous life by receiving a rap on the head that put me out of\r\ncommission during several hours.... Now, Mr. Sturgess--sorry, C. K.--and\r\nI are going on a little tour along the coast. We shall be away an hour\r\nor more. I advise you two to rig yourselves as best you can in my\r\nsuperfluous garments. Make sure they are quite dry. It may seem rather\r\nabsurd, but putting on damp clothing is an altogether different thing\r\nfrom allowing wet clothes to dry on your body. Keep a good fire. There\r\nis nothing to be afraid of. In this strange land there are neither\r\nanimals nor reptiles.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor birds,\" said Nina.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, plenty of birds, but the nesting season is long over, and many of\r\nthe sea-birds have gone south. As we progress further inland we shall\r\ncome across great colonies of puffins, ducks and swans. Curiously\r\nenough, there are plenty of humming-birds, which is about the last\r\nspecies one would expect off-hand to find in these wastes.... Come\r\nalong, C. K. Let us try and circumvent the wily seal.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not shoot one?\" said Sturgess.\r\n\r\n\"Because I have only twenty-four cartridges, and each one may yet be\r\nworth its weight in diamonds. Remember, everybody!--we only use the\r\nrifle in the last extremity, either for food, or fire, or actual\r\nself-preservation. Once lighted, on no account must the fire be allowed\r\nto die out. Even when we build a raft, we can imitate the natives, and\r\ncarry a fire with us. To save us men from temptation to-day, should we\r\nfind a seal, we'll leave the gun with the ladies.\r\n\r\n\"A couple of cudgels, with ends sharpened and hardened in the fire,\r\nshould serve our needs, and do the seal's business as well. If not, we\r\nmust try again, and exist on oysters until we become more expert....\r\nI'll put five cartridges in the magazine, and show you girls how it\r\nworks. If you regard each shell as worth, say, five thousand dollars,\r\nyou'll appreciate the net value of the whole twenty-four.\"\r\n\r\nWithin a few minutes Maseden and Sturgess set off. The tide was now at\r\nits lowest point, so they had no difficulty in walking in almost any\r\ndirection. Their first act was to drag ashore the remains of the bunk.\r\nGiven a quantity of malleable iron and a fire, it would not be an\r\nimpossible task to construct some rough tools.\r\n\r\nWhile placing this treasure-trove above high-water mark they saw the two\r\ngirls examining the stock of underclothes which Providence had literally\r\nprovided for their needs.\r\n\r\n\"Gosh!\" said Sturgess, almost reverently. \"It beats me to know how a\r\ncouple of delicate women could endure the hardships we have gone\r\nthrough.\"\r\n\r\n\"But women are not delicate. I don't understand why men invariably\r\nharbor that delusion. In passive resistance women are more steadfast,\r\neven hardier, than men. That is an essential, don't you see? The\r\ncontinuance of the race depends far more on the female than on the male.\r\nCivilization tries to upset the great principles of life, but fails,\r\nluckily. Savage tribes are aware of that elementary fact. Low down in\r\nthe social scale the women do all the work, while the men loaf around,\r\nand only get busy when hunting or fighting.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell you what, Alec,\" said Sturgess admiringly, \"once fairly started,\r\nyou talk like a book.\"\r\n\r\nSuch a remark could hardly fail to act as a gag on one of Maseden's\r\ntemperament. By habit a silent man, he shrank from even the semblance of\r\nloquacity. Sturgess could extract no further information from him. He in\r\nhis turn soon learned to guard his tongue when the Vermonter was in the\r\ntalking vein, and unconsciously pouring out the stock of knowledge and\r\nphilosophy garnered during those peaceful years on the ranch.\r\n\r\n\"We had better go this way,\" said Maseden, pointing towards the west.\r\n\"Don't you think it advisable to search the coast seaward? There have\r\nbeen three tides since the ship struck, and anything likely to come\r\nashore should have shown up by this time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go right ahead, Alec. What you say goes.\"\r\n\r\nTheir search was fruitless. Indeed, the position in which the leather\r\ntrunk was found proved that the set of the current on a rising tide was\r\nin the direction of the channel between the two small islands.\r\n\r\nMaseden had little or no experience of the sea and its vagaries, or he\r\nwould have noticed this highly significant fact, and thus saved himself\r\nand his companions much hardship and a good deal of needless risk.\r\n\r\nOf course, he saw quickly that there was a remarkable absence of\r\nwreckage on the north side of the estuary, but he attributed it to the\r\nfury of the gale, which must have driven a great body of water far into\r\nthe network of channels which stretched inland, with a resultant\r\noutpouring when the wind pressure was relaxed.\r\n\r\nThe only satisfactory outcome of a close visit to the bar was the\r\ncomplete vindication of their means of escape from the ledge. It would\r\nhave been a sheer impossibility to round the point at or slightly above\r\nsea-level. The tides of untold ages had literally scooped a chasm out of\r\nthe cliff, and perversely chosen to batter a passage through the rock\r\nrather than take the open path farther south.\r\n\r\nThey could not see the reef which had destroyed the _Southern Cross_.\r\nBut they could hear it. Ever above the clatter of the rollers on the\r\nnearer rocks they caught the sullen roar of the outer fury.\r\n\r\n\"Let's clear out of this,\" said Sturgess suddenly. \"That noise sends a\r\nchill right down my backbone.\"\r\n\r\nMaseden turned at once. In any case, they could not have remained there\r\nmuch longer, because the tide was on the flow, and they had yet to\r\ndiscover how swiftly it covered the rock-paved foreshore.\r\n\r\nThey did not hurry, but kept a sharp look-out for seals, seeing several,\r\nbut at a great distance. While they were yet nearly a quarter of a mile\r\nfrom the camping ground, from which came a pillar of smoke, showing that\r\nthe fire was not being neglected, they were startled by a gun-shot.\r\n\r\nIt smote the air with a sound that was all the more insistent in that it\r\nwas wholly unexpected. It drove into the sea, with a loud splash, a seal\r\nclose at hand which had been hidden by a rock, and even brought a pair\r\nof circling bustards from some eyrie high up on the hills.\r\n\r\nWith never a word to one another, both men began to run.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND SHIPWRECK\r\n\r\n\r\nA series of reefs does not supply the best of surfaces for a sprint.\r\nMaseden slipped on a bed of seaweed and fell headlong, fortunately\r\nescaping injury. Sturgess, lighter, perhaps more adroit on his feet--it\r\ncame out subsequently that he was an accomplished skater--stumbled\r\nseveral times, but contrived to keep going.\r\n\r\nThus he was the first to reach Madge Forbes, who hurried to meet them,\r\nfollowed by Nina, the latter walking more leisurely and carrying the\r\nrifle.\r\n\r\n\"What has happened?\" gasped Sturgess. He saw that the girl was pale and\r\nfrightened. She and her sister were continually looking backward, as\r\nthough expecting to find they were being pursued.\r\n\r\n\"I think--it is all right--now,\" she said brokenly. \"Nina shot at\r\nit--the most awful monster I have ever seen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Had it two legs, or four?\"\r\n\r\nSturgess was incorrigible. Notwithstanding the start caused by the sound\r\nof the gun, he grinned. The girl turned to Nina.\r\n\r\n\"Please tell them, Nina, that we are not romancing,\" she cried\r\nindignantly.\r\n\r\nNina handed the rifle to Maseden.\r\n\r\n\"Put this thing right,\" she said coolly. \"It won't work, but I'm sure I\r\nhit the beast with the first bullet.\"\r\n\r\nMaseden pressed down the lever, and saw that a cartridge had jammed, as\r\nthe extractor lever had not been jerked downward with sufficient force.\r\nHe began adjusting matters with the blade of his knife.\r\n\r\n\"Were you attacked by an animal?\" he inquired.\r\n\r\n\"We don't know exactly what it was,\" said Madge. \"When you left us we\r\ndecided to have a bath before putting on dry clothes. As our only towel\r\nwas the ship's flag, we arranged that each should rub the other dry with\r\nher hands. We had just finished dressing, and Nina had gone to pile\r\nfresh logs on the fire, when I heard a splash in the water of the creek.\r\nI looked around and saw a fearful creature, bigger than a horse, which\r\nbarked at me. I shrieked, and Nina ran with the rifle. The thing barked\r\nagain--it was only a few feet away--so she fired. Then we both made\r\noff.\"\r\n\r\n\"You disturbed a seal, I expect.\"\r\n\r\n\"No. If those were seals we saw last night, this was no seal,\" said Nina\r\ndecisively. \"It had small, fiery eyes and long tusks. I think it had\r\nflappers, though, in place of feet, but it was enormous.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sounds like a walrus,\" put in Sturgess.\r\n\r\n\"There are no walruses in the South Pacific,\" said Maseden. \"Anyhow, now\r\nthat the magazine works all right, let's go and have a look.\"\r\n\r\nAmple corroboration of the girl's story was soon forthcoming. The\r\nsplashing of water behind the group of big rocks sheltering the pool in\r\nwhich they had taken their bath showed that something unusual was going\r\non.\r\n\r\nThey all reached the spot in time to witness the last struggles of a\r\ngigantic sea-lion, one of the most fearsome-looking of the ocean's many\r\nstrange denizens. The shot fired by Nina Forbes had struck it fairly in\r\nthe throat, inflicting a wound which speedily proved mortal.\r\n\r\nThe animal was a full-grown male, fully ten feet in length, with a neck\r\nand shoulders of huge proportions. Its tusks and bristles gave it a most\r\nmenacing aspect. The wonder was not that the bathers ran, but that Nina\r\nhad the courage to face such a monster.\r\n\r\nMaseden was delighted, and patted her on the shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Well done!\" he cried. \"You've supplied the larder with fresh meat for\r\ndays. We must even try our 'prentice hands at curing what we can't eat\r\nto-day or to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl herself was not elated by her triumph. The water in which the\r\nsea-lion lay was deeply tinged with its blood, which had also\r\nbespattered the rocks.\r\n\r\n\"I have never before killed any living creature,\" she said in a rather\r\nmiserable tone. \"Why did the stupid thing attack us? We were doing it no\r\nharm.\"\r\n\r\nMaseden laughed.\r\n\r\n\"Off you go, both of you!\" he said. \"C. K. and I have the job of our\r\nlives now. It will be no joke disjointing this fellow with a couple of\r\npocket-knives. But if the fact brings any consolation, I may tell you\r\nthat a sea-lion when irritated can be a very ugly customer. Probably\r\nthis one was sleeping in the sun under the lee of a rock, and you may\r\nhave come unpleasantly near him without knowing it. When he awoke and\r\nsaw you he was curious. Instead of slinking off, he roared at you, and\r\nmight easily have killed the pair of you!\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't we help?\" inquired Nina, seeing that Maseden meant to lose no\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"But we ought to,\" she persisted. \"We must get used to such work.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can do something quite as serviceable by rigging a few lines on\r\nstout poles, where there is plenty of sun and air, and seeing that a big\r\nfire is kept up.... And, by the way, don't come this way till we call\r\nyou. We shan't be--presentable.\"\r\n\r\nThe two disappeared without further question.\r\n\r\n\"This will be a messy undertaking,\" Maseden explained to his assistant.\r\n\"The best thing we can do is strip, or our clothes will be in an awful\r\nstate.\"\r\n\r\nAt the outset they abandoned any thought of actually dismembering the\r\ncolossal carcass. They skinned it with difficulty, and then cut off the\r\nflesh in layers. After an hour's hard endeavor they had gathered a fine\r\nstore of meat, while the pelt, after being well washed in salt water,\r\nwas stretched on a flat rock to dry.\r\n\r\nThey were dressing again when a new trouble arose. From out of the void\r\nhad gathered a flock of vultures. These fierce, evil-looking birds were\r\nso daring in their efforts to raid the pile of meat that two actually\r\nallowed themselves to be knocked over by the staves the men carried.\r\n\r\nSturgess remained on guard, therefore, while Maseden took the strips and\r\nhung them on the lines the girls had already prepared.\r\n\r\nMadge volunteered to do the cooking. She had found two flat, thin\r\nstones, somewhat resembling hard slate, and she fancied that by placing\r\nsome steaks between these and covering them with glowing charcoal the\r\ntrick would be achieved. As a matter of fact, she succeeded wonderfully\r\nwell. Even Nina, sniffing her portion, vowed that the shooting of a\r\nsea-lion had its compensations.\r\n\r\nMore vultures arrived. The sea-lion's bones were rapidly picked clean,\r\nbut one of the men had to keep close watch all day over the curing\r\noperations.\r\n\r\nAn amusing argument arose as to the correct method of drying meat.\r\nMaseden held that he distinctly remembered reading that _biltong_, or\r\nSouth African antelope steak, was prepared by hanging the strips in the\r\nsun. The girls were positive that this would cause putrefaction, and\r\nthat the meat should be placed in the shade.\r\n\r\nAs Maseden was not quite sure of his facts, he compromised as to a\r\nquarter of the supply, with the result that this smaller quantity was\r\nrendered uneatable.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe story of Alexander Selkirk has been told so often, and in so many\r\nforms, that it will not bear repeating here. During a whole fortnight\r\nthese four young people devoted their wits and their muscles to the\r\nall-important task of feeding themselves and securing some means of\r\nescape into the interior. The men soon learned how to circumvent the\r\nwily seal, and thus store plenty of meat and skins, which latter, with\r\nsinews and a knife, were converted first into garments for the women\r\nand, as supplies increased, into a tent.\r\n\r\nMaseden noticed that the high-water mark fell daily, so he reasoned that\r\nthe _Southern Cross_ struck during a high spring tide, and that the neap\r\nwould occur in fourteen days. He laid his plans on that assumption,\r\nwhich was justified almost to a day.\r\n\r\nAnother gale blew up, but despite its discomfort it helped them\r\nmaterially, because the men loosened a barrier of logs which had formed\r\nhigh up the wooded cliff, and the rain freshet brought down far more\r\ntimber than was needed for the biggest raft they could hope to\r\nconstruct.\r\n\r\nAfter some experiments they decided to make it a three-tier one, and\r\nflexible in the center. Hence it was fully thirty feet in length, the\r\naverage length of a thick log being fifteen feet after its roots and\r\nthin section had been burnt off. For the same reason the raft was\r\nfifteen feet wide. It had a step in the forepart for their old friend,\r\nthe broken topmast. They dispensed with a rudder, believing they could\r\nguide their ark with poles.\r\n\r\nObservation showed that the tide flowed swiftly in mid-stream, and their\r\nwell-matured project was to push out to a prearranged point at\r\nhigh-water, anchor while the tide fell, and travel as far as practicable\r\non the next tide. They tried to avoid all risks that could be foreseen.\r\n\r\nThe raft was built in the waterway which Madge had termed the\r\n\"creek\"--the gulley cleared for itself by the torrent whose dry bed had\r\noffered them a road through the otherwise impenetrable forest. Every\r\ntest of stability their inventiveness could devise proved that an area\r\nof thirty feet by fifteen of logs arranged in three rows would support\r\nfour or five times the weight they were likely to place on it. By\r\nmanipulating the poles Maseden and Sturgess found that they could\r\ncontrol the movements of even such an unwieldy bulk, while if the wind\r\nsuited they might rig a sail of skins.\r\n\r\nThey were able to build quickly and well because of three essentials.\r\nThe timber was at hand, they had a fire, and in the pieces of rope and\r\nstrips of iron and wire they had invaluable means of making the\r\nstructure secure.\r\n\r\nAt last, on the fifteenth day after the wreck, Maseden poled out the\r\nraft during the slack tide at high-water, and fastened it to ropes\r\nalready fixed and buoyed nearly a quarter of a mile from the shore. He\r\nwould allow none of the others to accompany him, nor did he carry any of\r\nthe few stores they possessed. He could not be absolutely certain that\r\nthe cables would withstand the strain, and if the raft were swept\r\nseaward by the falling tide only one life was in jeopardy, while\r\nSturgess might be able to help him from the shore.\r\n\r\nHis vigil was watched by anxious eyes, especially when he thought fit to\r\nease the stress on the ropes by planting a long pole against a big rock\r\nwhich he knew rested a few feet astern and below the surface. The two\r\nhours of half-tide were the worst, but the anchors held. Three hours\r\nlater the raft was aground and he came ashore.\r\n\r\nIt was then nearly dark, as their first voyage would naturally be taken\r\nin broad daylight. Nothing was said at the time, but he was told\r\nafterwards, that for no conceivable guerdon would any of the three again\r\ngo through the agony of suspense they endured while the raft swung and\r\nlurched in the fierce current.\r\n\r\nMeat, fresh and dried, a quantity of oysters, the leather trunk, and a\r\ncharcoal fire cunningly packed in oyster shells kept in position by\r\nwire--this cooking brazier being the invention of Nina Forbes--formed\r\nthe cargo. Most fortunately Maseden carried the poncho and the rifle\r\nslung across his back with rope, and the cartridges were in his pockets.\r\n\r\nThey slept on board. Soon after daybreak the raft was afloat, but was\r\nnot allowed to move until there was a fair depth of water, owing to the\r\nvery great probability of the whole structure being dashed to pieces\r\nagainst some awkwardly placed boulder. At last, however, Maseden\r\nthought the channel was practicable, and the ropes were cast loose,\r\nbeing sacrificed, of course, but that could not be helped.\r\n\r\nThey were off! The first of the sixty miles was already slipping away.\r\nThey were so excited, so bent on the adventure ahead, that none of them\r\nthought of looking back until Providence Beach, which was the name they\r\ngave their refuge, was nearly out of sight.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Madge Forbes remembered, and turned her eyes in that direction.\r\nShe waved a hand and cried:\r\n\r\n\"Good-by, trees and rocks! You were kind to me and to all of us! I have\r\nnot had two such happy weeks since I came to South America!\"\r\n\r\nMaseden heard, but paid no particular heed. For one thing, he had\r\ndecided now not to re-open the question of the extraordinary relations\r\nbetween his wife and himself until, if ever, they reached civilization\r\nagain. For another, he was busily conning the channel and noting the\r\nbehavior of their clumsy but quite buoyant craft.\r\n\r\nHe estimated the pace of the current at fully six miles an hour. The\r\nraft was traveling about half that rate, which was quite fast enough for\r\nhis liking, so, although there was a strong breeze from the west, he did\r\nnot hoist the \"sail.\" He stood on the port side and Sturgess on the\r\nstarboard. The two girls were seated on a pile of fir branches behind\r\nthe mast, which was stayed by ropes in such wise that all four had\r\nsomething to cling to if the raft struck a sunken rock and lurched\r\nsuddenly.\r\n\r\nThe project was to drift as far inland as the day's tide would take\r\nthem, pole ashore at the nearest suitable place, and repeat the\r\novernight anchoring until they reached smooth water, when they might\r\nperhaps make longer voyages. If they ran six miles that day they would\r\nhave done admirably. Providing Maseden's calculations as to their\r\nprecise locality were reasonably accurate, the next day would bring them\r\ninto a much wider arm of the sea.\r\n\r\nHere the conditions might vary, but they would adapt themselves to\r\ncircumstances, always bearing in mind the exceeding wisdom of the\r\nItalian proverb: _Che va piano va sano_--\"He goes safely who goes\r\ncautiously.\"\r\n\r\nBut there are other proverbs which are equally applicable to human\r\naffairs, and especially to the hazards awaiting rafts floating on\r\nunknown waters. For an hour they ran on gaily, with little or no\r\ntrouble, because the men could see broken water a long way ahead and\r\npromptly piloted their argosy towards the open channel.\r\n\r\nThen came the unexpected, or, to be exact, the crisis arose which\r\nMaseden had foreseen many days earlier, but forgotten as the raft grew\r\nstrong and seaworthy under their hands.\r\n\r\nAbout four miles from Providence Beach the gap between the two small\r\nislands which shut off Hanover Island from its southerly neighbor came\r\ninto full view. Maseden anticipated a little difficulty at this point,\r\nbut he was quite unprepared for that which really took place.\r\n\r\nHe had every reason to believe that the main stream would flow straight\r\nahead until the second island was passed; he meant to land on Hanover\r\nIsland again, just short of the easterly end of Island Number Two.\r\nTherefore he was annoyed, but not alarmed at first, at finding that the\r\ncurrent carried the raft into the straits between the islets.\r\n\r\nThe others, of course, noticed the change of direction, and being well\r\naware of his hopes and plans, asked him in chorus if this deviation\r\nmattered.\r\n\r\n\"I don't see that it does,\" he said. \"In any case, we must follow the\r\ntide, and if this is the short cut so much the better.\"\r\n\r\nHe told them that which he actually believed. Still, at the back of his\r\nhead lay an uneasiness hard to account for. The raft was traveling south\r\nnow, not east, having swept round the bend in magnificent style. The\r\nprecipitous heights were closing in, but the channel was fully a quarter\r\nof a mile in width. He would vastly have preferred skirting the wooded\r\nslopes of Hanover Island, because these smaller islets were absolutely\r\nbarren in this hitherto invisible section, but, having no choice in the\r\nmatter, silenced his doubts by recalling his first and quite correct\r\ntheory that the real deep-water passage lay beyond, the _Southern Cross_\r\nhaving in fact struck several miles north of Nelson Straits.\r\n\r\nOwing to the steady narrowing of the waterway the rate at which they\r\ntraveled was increasing momentarily, though progress was delightfully\r\nsmooth and easy. The simile did not occur to any of the four until\r\ncomplete disaster had befallen them, but the silent, resistless onrush\r\nof the current was ominously suggestive of the course of some great\r\nriver during the last few miles before it hurls itself over a cataract.\r\n\r\nHanover Island soon vanished from sight altogether, and the towering\r\ncliffs on either hand seemed to merge into an unbroken barrier ahead.\r\nBut the tidal race hurried on, so there must be an outlet, and this\r\npresented itself, after a sharp turn to eastward again, when they had\r\ncovered a couple of miles on the new course.\r\n\r\nThey were only given the briefest warning of the peril into which they\r\nwere being carried. The stream flung itself against a great mass of\r\nrock, which had been undermined until the upper edge of the precipice\r\nhung out fifty feet or more over the rushing waters beneath. A most\r\nuncanny maelstrom was thus created.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had the two men seen the danger than they labored with might\r\nand main to slew the raft away to the opposite shore.\r\n\r\nThey succeeded in avoiding the first jumble of black rocks which lay at\r\nthe base of the cliff, but the whole character of the stream changed\r\ninstantly. It became a furious turmoil of broken water. The raft was\r\nhurled hither and thither as though by some titanic force, and a few\r\nyards farther on was dashed against a second and even more terrifying\r\nreef.\r\n\r\nThe violence of the impact smashed the whole structure to pieces. Had\r\nnot the logs been arranged in tiers crosswise they must have split up\r\ninstantly, but the method in which they were put together held them for\r\none precious moment while the men each clutched one of the girls and\r\nleaped for the nearest rock.\r\n\r\nBy rare good luck they kept their feet, and reached a great flat mass\r\nwhich, judged by appearances, had only recently fallen.\r\n\r\nFurther advance or retreat was alike impossible. On three sides roared\r\nthe cheated torrent; behind and above, canopy-wise, towered the cliff.\r\nIf the evidence of ominous fissures and lateral cracks were to be read\r\naright, there was no telling the moment when they might be buried under\r\nanother avalanche of thousands of tons of stone.\r\n\r\nEvery tide deepened the sap. They were imprisoned in one of nature's own\r\nquarries, where work was relentless and unceasing.\r\n\r\nOnce again idle chance had decided that Maseden should save Nina and\r\nSturgess Madge. Not that it mattered a jot. If ever four people were in\r\nhapless case, it was they. For a time even to Maseden, who had never\r\nlost faith in his star, it seemed that the best fortune that could now\r\nbefall would be for the trembling rock overhead to crash down on them.\r\n\r\nThe din was terrific, and the water level was rising so rapidly that\r\nfive minutes after they had gained their present position the boulders\r\nto which they had sprung from the sundering platform of logs were a foot\r\ndeep in the swirling current. Each of the girls, wholly unconscious of\r\nher attitude, clung despairingly to the man at her side and watched the\r\nclimbing surge with somber eyes.\r\n\r\nThey were too stunned to yield to fear, and the life of the past\r\nfortnight had so steeled their nerves and strengthened their bodies that\r\nfainting was no longer the readiest means of obtaining a merciful\r\nrespite from present horrors. Rather did a bitter rage possess them, for\r\nit was a harsh and monstrous decree of fate which had not only robbed\r\nthem of a hard-won means of escape, but immersed them in a veritable\r\ncondemned cell.\r\n\r\nMaseden, like the others, was watching the encroaching water-line in a\r\nbenumbed way when he became aware that Nina was speaking. He looked into\r\nher drawn face and tried to smile, though a sort of mist clouded his\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n\"What is it, girlie?\" he said, putting his mouth close to her ear and\r\naddressing her as though she were a timid child.\r\n\r\n\"Is this the end?\" she cried, imitating him.\r\n\r\n\"Not yet, anyhow,\" and he gave her a reassuring hug.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me--if you think--we have only a few more minutes,\" she said.\r\n\r\nHe read nothing into the request save a natural desire that she should\r\nbe prepared for the worst and try to cross the Great Divide with a\r\nprayer on her lips. The pitiful words helped to dispel the cloud which\r\nhad befogged his wits, and he began to weigh the pros and cons of the\r\nforlornest of forlorn hopes.\r\n\r\nThe water was lapping their feet. The rock arched outward over their\r\nheads. Between the spot where they stood and the actual wall of rock\r\nthere was already a flowing stream.\r\n\r\nHe looked at his watch. The hour was seven o'clock, and he estimated the\r\ntime of high-water at about half-past seven. Then, as when he was lying\r\nalong the foremast of the _Southern Cross_ amid the thunders of the\r\nreef, a tiny seed of hope sprang into life in his brain. If they could\r\noutlast the tide there was still a chance!\r\n\r\nThe very fact that this chaos of fallen cliff created a fearsome rapid\r\nin the tide-way showed that the passage must be fairly open during low\r\nwater. If promptness in decision could enable a man to conquer a\r\ndifficulty, Maseden was certainly not lacking in that attitude.\r\n\r\n\"Come!\" he said. \"Not for the first time, we must put our backs to the\r\nwall. We may find a good grip for our feet before the water mounts too\r\nhigh. The four of us must lace arms and cling together. I believe the\r\ntide will not rise above our knees. At any rate, we cannot be swept away\r\neasily. It is worth trying.\"\r\n\r\nShe nodded. Turning to her sister, she explained Maseden's scheme. Soon\r\nthey were braced against the rock and facing valiantly their new ordeal.\r\n\r\nIn the Middle Ages, when a lust for inflicting torture infected some men\r\nlike a cancerous growth, a favorite method of at once punishing and\r\ndestroying an unfortunate enemy was to chain him in a dungeon to which a\r\ntidal river had access, and leave him there until the slow-rising flood\r\ndrowned him.\r\n\r\nThey were in some such plight, self-chained to a rock, though not\r\nknowing when a sudden swirl of water might sweep them to speedy death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTHE TURN OF THE TIDE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe change, when it came, came swiftly. It was as though the\r\nAll-Powerful bade the waters cease their snarling and stilled the fury\r\nof the reef. During nearly an hour the sea lapped the very thighs of the\r\nfour castaways, but the roar of battle between rocks and current had\r\ndied down and it was possible to hear the spoken word.\r\n\r\nSturgess was the first to break the spell cast on the whole party by the\r\nseeming imminence of death.\r\n\r\n\"If ever I set foot in New York again I'll be good and go to church\r\nSundays,\" he said. \"This is Sunday, February 6, an' I guess I've been as\r\nnear Kingdom Come to-day as I'm likely to get on a round trip ticket.\"\r\n\r\nFor a little while no one passed any comment. Sunday! The mere name of\r\nthe day had a bizarre sound. What had God-given Sunday and its peaceful\r\nassociations to do with this grim and savage wilderness?\r\n\r\nSuddenly Nina Forbes began to recite the Lord's Prayer. One by\r\none the others joined in. The concluding petition had a peculiar\r\nappropriateness. If ever four Christian people might appeal to be\r\ndelivered from evil, surely these four were in great need of heavenly\r\nsuccor.\r\n\r\n\"That's fine!\" said Sturgess, almost cheerfully, when a hearty \"Amen\"\r\nhad relieved their surcharged feelings. \"Me for the pine pew and the\r\nright sort of preacher when next I stroll out of West Fifty-seventh\r\nStreet into Broadway of a Sabbath morning. Anyhow, to-day being Sunday,\r\nand the hour rather early, which way do we head for the nearest church\r\nwhen the tide falls, commodore?\"\r\n\r\nMaseden had already weighed that very question, but the utter collapse\r\nof the voyage on which he had founded such high hopes had chastened his\r\npride.\r\n\r\n\"I think we had better put it to the vote,\" he said. \"I've led you into\r\nsuch a death-trap already that I don't feel equal to a decision.\"\r\n\r\nHe had been watching a big rock on the opposite shore. A little while\r\nago it was awash; now it was submerged, yet the water was appreciably\r\nlower where they were standing.\r\n\r\nThe seeming contradiction was puzzling. He had yet to learn that the\r\nlaws governing water in motion are extraordinarily complex--take to\r\nwitness the varying levels of the whirlpool in the Niagara River and the\r\nalmost phenomenal height of the central stream in the Niagara rapids.\r\n\r\n\"Guess we're satisfied with your control so far,\" said Sturgess. \"What\r\nare you making a kick about? You prophesied just what would occur, and\r\nthat's more than the average wizard can do.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"Didn't you tell us we might strike a score of reefs between Providence\r\nBeach and Smyth's Channel, and that we should be lucky if we didn't have\r\nto build 'steen rafts?\"\r\n\r\nMaseden smiled. The rock he had marked as an index was reappearing, and\r\nthe water had sunk another inch below his knees. The tide had\r\nunquestionably turned; the water banked up on the opposite shore was\r\nalso yielding to the new force.\r\n\r\n\"I never anticipated another complete shipwreck,\" he said. \"We have lost\r\neverything, ropes, skins, food--our chief supporter, the broken\r\nforemast--even our flag.\"\r\n\r\n\"But we still have the rifle and cartridges, and we're plus a\r\nfortnight's experience. If we don't start life again better fixed than\r\nwhen we climbed to the ledge in the dark from the forecastle of the\r\n_Southern Cross_, call me a Dutchman.\"\r\n\r\n\"I agree with C. K.,\" Nina chimed in. \"Even here there must be some sort\r\nof a passage at low water. Which way shall we go--back or forward?\"\r\n\r\n\"We gain nothing by going back,\" said Maseden slowly. \"For one thing, we\r\nare on the wrong side of the channel. For another, I have been taking\r\nstock of the peculiar vagaries of the tide during the past fifteen\r\nminutes, and I imagine that there is a slight difference in the water\r\nlevel between this point and that which we left this morning. Still\r\nwater attains a dead level, of course, but strong tides have rules of\r\ntheir own.\r\n\r\n\"Now, supposing the tide from the Pacific runs into Providence Beach a\r\nfew minutes earlier than it reaches Nelson Straits, that would account\r\nfor the terrific rush in which we were caught. For the same cause, the\r\nfalling tide should be far less strenuous here, but stronger there, and\r\nI do really believe that opposite our camp the ebb tide always developed\r\na swifter current than the flood.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure of it,\" agreed Sturgess. \"They were both pretty hefty, but\r\nthis morning's flood didn't begin to compare with last night's ebb. You\r\nought to know. You went through it alone on board the raft.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then the answer is, 'Go forward,'\" said Madge.\r\n\r\n\"I think so. Let us be guided by events. We have the best part of the\r\nday before us. Surely we can find some safer lodgment than this before\r\nnight falls.\"\r\n\r\nThe others knew that Maseden's voice had lost its confident ring, but\r\nthe fact that they had so narrowly dodged death barred all other\r\nconsiderations.\r\n\r\nIn his heart of hearts he was deadly afraid that they might indeed be\r\ncompelled to return to Hanover Island. The sheer barrenness of the islet\r\non which they were now stranded was its vital defect. Probably they\r\nwould still find shell-fish, still knock an occasional seal on the head,\r\nbut wood they must have, both for fire and raft building, and it seemed\r\nto him that there were no trees nearer than the slopes facing Providence\r\nBeach.\r\n\r\nHowever, having come so far, they might at least have a look at the\r\nconditions on the south side, where lay yet another island; and there\r\nwas also the unalterable fact that if they must escape by using the\r\ntides, their first day's experiences, though resulting in disaster, had\r\nbrought them many miles in the right direction.\r\n\r\nPerhaps they had met and conquered their greatest danger. They had paid\r\na dear price for victory, but that was nothing new in war.\r\n\r\nOf course there was a long and wearisome wait before they could do other\r\nthan sit on the slowly emerging rocks. But it was something gained when\r\nthey were free to climb out into the open and see the sky over their\r\nheads. The silent, nerve-racking menace of the canopied rock was quite\r\nas unbearable as the loud-mouthed threats of sea and reef.\r\n\r\nMadge, slightly less self-contained than her sister, promptly voiced her\r\nrelief.\r\n\r\n\"If I live to be older than I want to be I shall never forget one awful\r\ncrack in the roof just above us,\" she said. \"I couldn't keep my eyes off\r\nit. It seemed to be opening and shutting all the time with a horrible\r\nslowness.\"\r\n\r\n\"How old do you want to be?\" demanded Sturgess, readily seizing the\r\nchance to divert her thoughts from a nightmare memory.\r\n\r\n\"Forty-five,\" she answered without any hesitation.\r\n\r\n\"Gee! That leaves me less than eighteen years to live!\"\r\n\r\n\"I wasn't thinking of you, C. K.\"\r\n\r\n\"But your limit rouses one's curiosity. Why forty-five, any more than\r\nfifty or sixty? Granted good health, heaps of people enjoy life at\r\nsixty.\"\r\n\r\n\"At forty-five a woman begins to fade and men grow horrid,\" she\r\nannounced calmly, as though stating an incontrovertible thesis.\r\n\r\n\"Please don't talk rubbish, either of you,\" interrupted Nina sharply.\r\n\"Alec, can't we dodge along from rock to rock? It seems to be ever so\r\nmuch more open half a mile ahead.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's try,\" said Maseden.\r\n\r\nHe wondered vaguely why Nina broke in on her sister's quaint theorizing.\r\nAny nonsense which took their minds off the troubles of the hour was a\r\ngood thing in itself.\r\n\r\nThey scrambled and slithered through the passage, which resembled the\r\nmoraine of a glacier, save that the rocks were on the same plane, and\r\nthe central stream was clear and greenish instead of being nearly milk\r\nwhite. Once they were held up fully fifteen minutes because the channel\r\nran close to an overhanging rock which really looked as though it might\r\nbe brought down by the disturbance of a pebble.\r\n\r\nThen Maseden was moved to make investigations, and discovered that the\r\nmain waterway was extraordinarily deep. In other words, the sea had\r\npreferred to scoop out a ditch rather than flow through the ample space\r\nbordering Hanover Island. Even at low tide there was deep water here.\r\n\r\n\"We must go on, one at a time,\" he said, and led the way.\r\n\r\nHe found that Nina Forbes was close behind.\r\n\r\n\"Remain where you are!\" he said gruffly. \"I'll tell you when to follow\r\nand indicate the best track.\"\r\n\r\nShe frowned, and her eyes sparkled, but she obeyed. Sturgess, too,\r\ngrowled a protest.\r\n\r\n\"He ought to give me that kind of try-out,\" he said. \"If there's\r\ntrouble, and I go under, it won't matter so much. But you girls can't\r\nspare Alec. He's worth twenty of me when it comes to a show-down.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, they all crossed the danger point safely, and each in turn\r\nnoticed that which Maseden alone had been able to see at first--that a\r\nhuge buttress had fallen quite recently, probably during the preceding\r\ntide, so the whole mass might crumble into ruin at any moment. As was\r\ntheir way, once a danger had passed they did not discuss it again.\r\nSturgess, of course, had something to say, though it only bore\r\ninferentially on this latest risk.\r\n\r\n\"I always had a notion that the New York Fire Department was a pretty\r\nnervy proposition,\" he informed all and sundry during a halt on the only\r\nstrip of open beach yet encountered in their new exploration, \"but I\r\nguess I can show the chief a few fresh stunts first time I blow into\r\nheadquarters on East Sixty-seventh Street.\"\r\n\r\nSturgess's airy references to New York were excellent tonics. He refused\r\nto regard that great city and its ordered life as dreamlike figments of\r\nthe imagination. To him the flaring lights of Broadway ever glimmered\r\nabove the horizon. Had he sighted the Statue of Liberty around the next\r\nbend _that_ would mean reality; _this_, the dreary expanse of dead\r\nhills, water and black rock, would have been the dream.\r\n\r\nMaseden, recovering his poise, had resumed his everyday air of\r\nwell-grounded optimism. At any rate, he argued, the four of them were\r\nliving and uninjured. They still owned those thrice-precious cartridges,\r\nthe rifle and the poncho. They had many hours of daylight before them,\r\nand would surely find drinkable water and food before dark.\r\n\r\nHappily the weather was fine, though clouds banking up in the west told\r\nof a possible gale, which might blow itself out in a few hours, or last\r\nas many days, or weeks. In that climate there was no knowing. The\r\nalmanac declared that it was high summer, yet it would be no uncommon\r\nevent if a snowstorm came from the southwest and mantled all the land a\r\nfoot deep.\r\n\r\nAs for their clothes being wet, these young people thought little of\r\nsuch a trifle. Their skins were becoming, in the expressive Indian\r\nphrase, \"all face.\"\r\n\r\nSo they trudged on, heading for the mouth of the defile. In the far\r\ndistance they discerned the broken line of another mountainous island,\r\nthe lower slopes black with forests.\r\n\r\n\"That's a good sign, folk,\" said Maseden, smiling cheerfully once more.\r\n\"We're making for a timber belt. When you come to think of it, trees\r\nsimply couldn't grow on these rocks, and the watershed seems to fall\r\naway on both sides of the gorge, which must have been cut by an\r\nearthquake.\"\r\n\r\nHis eyes had been searching constantly for signs of the raft's wreckage,\r\nbut never so much as a splintered log could he see. Nina, not so\r\npreoccupied, was gazing farther afield.\r\n\r\nSuddenly she stopped, and something in her manner arrested the others.\r\n\r\n\"I don't think I'm mistaken,\" she said, \"but are not those two points\r\nthe flanks of these islands?\"\r\n\r\n\"There can be little doubt of that,\" agreed Maseden, following her\r\nglance towards the gap some three or four miles in front. It was\r\ndifficult to estimate distance accurately in that region of vast\r\nsolitudes.\r\n\r\n\"Then, if that is so,\" she went on in a puzzled tone, \"where does the\r\nremainder of the land go to? The cliffs end not so very far away. Why\r\ndon't we see other bits sticking out?\"\r\n\r\nThe underlying sense of the question was clearer than its form. For some\r\nundetermined cause the passage between the islands evidently widened\r\nconsiderably before it closed in at the ultimate southern exit.\r\nHopefulness is often a close blend of curiosity and expectation. They\r\npressed on more rapidly, eager as children to see what lay around the\r\ncorner.\r\n\r\nThey were soon enlightened, and most agreeably so. They entered a\r\nspacious amphitheatre--in its way, almost a place of beauty. Not only\r\nwere the hillsides clothed with pines and other trees, but, rarest sight\r\nof all along that stark coast, strips of white sand bordered the\r\nforeshore.\r\n\r\nThe tidal water, now near the lowest ebb, was placid as a lake, and on\r\nits surface disported flocks of many varieties of wild fowl. Moreover,\r\nwreckage began to line the beach at high-water mark. They found the\r\nplanks and spars of many ships, some quite fresh, and evidently the\r\nremains of the _Southern Cross_; others weather-beaten, even crumbling\r\nwith age.\r\n\r\nRemains of the raft were discovered, and Nina shrieked with joy at sight\r\nof the ship's flag, hardly damaged, lying on its halliard alongside the\r\nbroken topmast.\r\n\r\nMadge claimed the most remarkable bit of flotsam--nothing less than the\r\nbrandy bottle, unbroken, but nearly full of salt water, half buried in\r\nsand.\r\n\r\nIt was their only drinking utensil, and therefore prized very highly.\r\nHow it had passed through the turmoil of the rapids was one of those\r\nmysteries which voyaging bottles alone can solve; and they, if sometimes\r\neloquent of humanity's adventures, are invariably silent as to their\r\nown.\r\n\r\nThe skins of the sea-lion and seals had vanished. Indeed, a very close\r\nsearch of a three-mile semi-circular beach, conducted for reasons which\r\nshall presently appear, yielded no trace of them.\r\n\r\nThere was a dramatic fitness in thus reaching a land of plenty after\r\nenduring the horrors of the pass.\r\n\r\n\"It's like a fairy tale,\" cried Nina joyously. \"This is the enchanted\r\nrealm, guarded by dragons which must be slain ere the prince can enter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gosh!\" grinned Sturgess, \"she's calling you a prince now, Alec. Say,\r\nMadge, can't you invent a name for me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you're the Ugly Duckling which grew into a Swan.\"\r\n\r\n\"Huh! I'll think that over. Far be it from me, fair maid, to dispute\r\nyour views as to my future plumage. Now, Alec, your turn. It's up to you\r\nto christen Nina.\"\r\n\r\n\"Cinderella, maid of all work,\" said Maseden promptly. \"So, let's get\r\nbusy, the lot of us. Girls, you'll probably find an oyster-bed on that\r\nreef over there. Sturgess and I will hunt for water, and bring you a\r\nbottleful. Then we must set to work and build a shack above high-water\r\nmark before night. We're going to stop here and launch a more navigable\r\ncraft next time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your highness has forgotten one thing,\" said Nina, with sudden gravity.\r\n\r\n\"What is that?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is still Sunday.\"\r\n\r\nWith one accord they dropped to their knees and thanked Providence for\r\nthe mercy which had been shown them. Such prayers are the spontaneous\r\ntribute of the overflowing heart. They are not to be uttered aloud or\r\nrecorded in the written word.\r\n\r\nThe men had no difficulty in locating a stream, owing to the \"creek,\" as\r\nMadge had phrased it, which marked the approach of each torrent to the\r\nsea. Here, too, were oysters in abundance. Whether or not the bivalves\r\nliked a certain admixture of fresh water and brine, their enthusiastic\r\nadmirers did not know; but certainly the best-stocked beds were\r\ninvariably situated near the mouth of a mountain stream.\r\n\r\nWith a plentiful supply of shaped planks, cordage, even rusty nails,\r\nthey soon knocked together a low hut, not more than breast high, and\r\nclosed at one end. The ship's flag curtained off the inner section,\r\nwhich was allotted to the two girls, while the men could sleep, on\r\nguard, as it were, in the outer part.\r\n\r\nAs night came on they started a fire and cooked two birds of the penguin\r\ntype, which allowed themselves to be chased and captured. The flesh was\r\ntough and none too well flavored, but the feasters were not hard to\r\nplease. When the repast was ended, and they sat on piles of soft sand\r\nlooking out over the darkening expanse of waters, for the tide was high\r\nagain, Maseden electrified Sturgess by saying:\r\n\r\n\"Do you smoke, C. K.?\"\r\n\r\n\"Does a duck swim?\" was the prompt reply.\r\n\r\nMaseden produced from his coat pocket a pipe and tin of tobacco.\r\n\r\nThe other eyed them with downright amazement.\r\n\r\n\"Well, can you beat it?\" he cried. \"What else have you got in your\r\npocket, old scout? A bottle of rye whisky and a box of chocolates for\r\nthe girls, or what?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've reached the end of my resources now,\" laughed Maseden. \"I resolved\r\nto keep this small stock of tobacco till the time came when we might\r\nregard half our troubles as ended. I think we've reached that stage\r\nto-night. After this morning's escape I shall never again lose hope\r\nuntil the light goes out forever.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, please, don't put it that way,\" said Nina.\r\n\r\n\"I mean it as an optimist,\" he exclaimed. \"If I have to swim in the open\r\nsea, or am buried under a landslide, I shall still believe, while my\r\nsenses last, that Providence will see me through. Do you know why? You\r\nmight supply many good reasons, but not _the_ reason. Ten minutes after\r\nwe climbed under that overhanging rock, it fell. I happened to look\r\nback, and saw it collapse. None of us heard the crash, because we were\r\nclose to a rather noisy rapid at the moment. But I actually saw the\r\nthing happen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why didn't you tell us at the time?\" inquired Madge.\r\n\r\n\"I thought our nervous systems, collectively, had borne enough strain\r\njust then.... Here you are, C. K. I give you first turn with the pipe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not on your life!\" vowed Sturgess, flaming into volcanic energy. \"If I\r\nnever smoke again, I'll not touch that pipe until you've gone right\r\nthrough a packed bowl-full.\"\r\n\r\nMaseden knew that his friend meant what he said, so filled and lighted\r\nthe pipe immediately.\r\n\r\n\"It's a moot point,\" he commented philosophically, \"whether you don't\r\nenjoy smoking more in anticipation than I in actuality. I haven't smoked\r\nnow during sixteen days, and I believe I could give it up for sixteen\r\nyears if need be.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good gracious!\" tittered Madge. \"Poor C. K. will have only two years of\r\nhis beloved New York.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a subtle thrust. Sturgess himself was the first to see its point.\r\n\r\n\"Gosh!\" he said. \"S'pose we four had to live here straight on for\r\nsixteen years!\"\r\n\r\nNina Forbes seemed to have a keener sense of the dangerous trend of\r\nsuch careless talk than her sister.\r\n\r\n\"I do wish you two wouldn't babble,\" she broke in sharply. \"Alec is\r\nsimply chock full of information. I can see it in his calculating eye.\r\nFor instance--\"\r\n\r\nMaseden took the cue readily.\r\n\r\n\"For instance,\" he said. \"This inland lagoon explains the rush of the\r\ntide this morning. The greater part of the water which runs through the\r\npass never goes back. It floods this immense area, is held up by the\r\ntide from the south, but goes out that way, because, by some irregular\r\ntidal action, the ebb begins in that direction. Therefore, an ideal\r\nbackwash is set up, which accounts for all the wreckage strewed on the\r\nbeach. Parts of ships which were lost a century ago will be stored here.\r\nThe place is a maritime museum.\"\r\n\r\n\"We may find a whole ship,\" exclaimed Madge.\r\n\r\n\"What? After coming through the hell-gate we have left behind?\"\r\n\r\n\"The bottle came through,\" she persisted.\r\n\r\n\"Though it's a black bottle it must have been white with fear many a\r\nscore of times. Have you noticed the way in which the logs of our own\r\nraft were battered and bruised?... No, the way in was vile, and, I had\r\nbetter warn you now, the way out may be worse.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, why?\" cried both girls.\r\n\r\n\"Because of the absence of Indians. Consider what an ideal site\r\nthis would be for a colony of savages. Plenty of fish, birds and\r\noysters--sand--even a few level strips which might be cultivated--if\r\nthe South American Indian ever does till the land. The logic of the\r\nsituation is clear. Our refuge is inaccessible. That is just the\r\ndifference between romance and reality. In the fairy tale, once you slay\r\nthe dragons guarding the enchanted palace the remainder is a compound of\r\nnectar and kisses. In real life, having stormed the fortress, you find\r\nyourself besieged.\"\r\n\r\nNone disputed his conclusions. They were learning to think like him,\r\nand each had been struck by the virgin solitude of this land-locked\r\nsea-lake, which must compare favorably with the most fertile and\r\nexceedingly scarce localities of the kind in an area of many scores\r\nof thousands of square miles.\r\n\r\n\"Anyhow, while you finish your pipe, it's up to me to fix the fire,\"\r\nsaid Sturgess blithely, leaping to his feet, and beginning to arrange a\r\nnumber of big flat stones around and above a pile of glowing charcoal\r\nin such wise that rain could not extinguish it, and a few twigs placed\r\namong the embers next morning would quickly burst into a blaze.\r\n\r\nThey had taught themselves these minor aids to comfort. Madge had\r\nconstructed a very creditable field oven, and Nina, with a bit of\r\nsharpened wire and a supply of dried sinews, could sew a skin as a\r\ncobbler stitches the sole on to a boot. Physically all four were in\r\nsplendid condition, so it was a sheer impossibility that they should\r\nremain downcast in spirit. Maseden knew that quite well when he recited\r\nthe trials they must yet face and conquer. He addressed them as\r\nco-workers, not as pampered young people who must be humored into\r\nputting forth the necessary efforts if they would win through finally.\r\n\r\nThey slept that night as soundly as though the morning's tribulation\r\nwas something they had read in a book. Rain pounded on their shelter,\r\nbut it was roofed with pine branches above the planks, and not a drop\r\nentered. They awoke into a world of blue sky and sunshine, and, after\r\nbreakfasting on oysters, cold fowl, and good water, spent an idle hour\r\nin watching the tidal race from the north.\r\n\r\nThen, after tending the fire, they set off on a tour of the shore,\r\nmeaning to note every scrap of wreckage which might be of value.\r\nMoreover, Maseden was specially anxious to have a peep at the southern\r\nexit.\r\n\r\nAnd thus they made the great discovery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTHE SIMPLE LIFE\r\n\r\n\r\nWho found the boat? The question has not been answered to this day. Four\r\npeople held and vehemently expressed different opinions; if they had not\r\nagreed ultimately to pool the credit, the foundations of six very firm\r\nfriendships might have been endangered, because even the sisters were at\r\nlogger-heads on the point.\r\n\r\nNo one could dispute the fact that it was Nina Forbes who, with\r\noutstretched hand and pointing finger, exclaimed dramatically:\r\n\r\n\"What is that?\"\r\n\r\nBut the other three yielded her no prior right on that account. Were\r\nthey not all looking at it, and thinking that which Nina said?\r\n\r\nEach could establish a most reasonable claim if the matter were\r\nadjudicated by a prize court. Firstly, Maseden had ordered a close\r\nsurvey of the coast, and, if this very proper precaution had not been\r\ntaken, the boat would be rotting yet on an uncharted beach. Secondly, if\r\nSturgess had not slipped on a rock and scarified his chin rather badly\r\nthere would, thirdly, have been no need for Madge to suggest that he\r\nshould wash the wound in fresh water, and even insist that this should\r\nbe done.\r\n\r\nLastly, there was Nina, who literally demanded an explanation of a long,\r\nlow strip of taut canvas visible above a small sand hill on which tufts\r\nof coarse grass were struggling for life.\r\n\r\nThe simplest way out of the difficulty was to admit that sheer,\r\nunadulterated good luck brought about an incident which probably changed\r\nthe whole course of events, though a white and shining patch of skin on\r\nSturgess's left leg testifies to this day that his accident was\r\nprimarily responsible for it.\r\n\r\nTwo fair-sized streams ran from the hills into the straits on that side.\r\nNear the first was pitched the camp. Well hidden near the second was the\r\nboat.\r\n\r\nNow, these rivulets, though fairly deep and swift, were not torrents;\r\nthat is to say, they drained a watershed by no means so steep as Hanover\r\nIsland. Their volume was more regular, inasmuch as they were not wholly\r\nthe outcome of the latest downpour of rain. To avoid the necessity of\r\nfording them, one had to walk a long way seaward until their waters\r\nbegan to spread over the reef in a hundred little runnels, and one could\r\nleap from rock to rock.\r\n\r\nIndeed, it was while Sturgess was so doing that he barked his shin, a\r\nmost painful if not dangerous operation; in this instance, it evoked\r\nlanguage which the girls pretended not to hear.\r\n\r\nHaving crossed the stream, however, Madge examined the damage, and would\r\nhave it that the sufferer take off his boot and sock, and forthwith lave\r\nthe wound in fresh water.\r\n\r\nWhat he really wanted to do was to wander away out of earshot and\r\nrelieve his feelings by the spoken word. He obeyed, however, and all\r\nfour went up the right bank (which, as Sturgess and Madge jointly cited\r\nin their contention, they certainly would not have done otherwise) to a\r\npoint where the river was free of salt-water.\r\n\r\nIn the result, curiously enough, Sturgess's excoriated wound was left\r\nabsolutely to its own devices. Both he and Madge, not to mention the\r\nother two, were startled out of any further thought of such a minor\r\ncasualty by coming full tilt on to a ship's boat, trimly sheeted in gray\r\ncanvas, dry-docked, one might say, behind a sandhill.\r\n\r\nAfter an incredulous stare, Maseden answered Nina's eager question.\r\n\r\n\"It is one of the life-boats of the _Southern Cross_,\" he said, and his\r\nvoice was hushed, almost reverent. \"There is her number, with the ship's\r\nname. She was carried on the starboard side, just behind the forward\r\nrail on the promenade deck. I used to look up at her and admire her\r\nlines.\"\r\n\r\nBy this time they had raced up alongside the craft. She appeared to be\r\nundamaged. Maseden unlaced a portion of the canvas cover. She was dry\r\nas a bone inside.\r\n\r\n\"Say, Alec, d'you know that every boat was stocked with provisions and\r\nwater for twenty people for fourteen days? I heard the captain give the\r\norder.\"\r\n\r\nSturgess was so excited that he almost yelped the words.\r\n\r\n\"I saw the stewards putting the stuff on board,\" said Maseden.\r\n\r\n\"There's tea, and coffee, and condensed milk, and butter, and tins of\r\nmeat and jam,\" cried Nina.\r\n\r\n\"And ship's biscuits, and a spirit stove, and matches, and barrels of\r\nwater,\" chimed in Madge.\r\n\r\nMaseden was tapping the planks and peering at so much of the keel as\r\nwas visible, but he could find no sign of injury. The smart white paint\r\nhad been badly scraped amidships and in the bows, but the wood was\r\nnot splintered. To the best of his belief the craft was thoroughly\r\nseaworthy. She carried her full complement of oars, a mast, and lugsail.\r\nIn fact, she was almost in the exact condition in which she had left the\r\nship.\r\n\r\nTwo pulleys and a part of a broken davit showed how she had been\r\nwrenched bodily from her berth and flung into the sea by the first great\r\nwave that crashed over the _Southern_ _Cross_ when the steamship swung\r\nbroadside on to the reef under the pull of the aft anchor.\r\n\r\n\"Come along, everybody!\" shouted Maseden, and the ring of triumph in his\r\nvoice revealed the depth of his feelings. \"We start building a new camp\r\nat once. Within less than a fortnight the spring tides which brought her\r\nhere will be with us again, and we must be ready for them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't we launch her on rollers?\" demanded Sturgess.\r\n\r\n\"I doubt it. She was docked here by a backwash which does not occur very\r\noften, judging by the herbage growing among the sand. She is a heavy\r\ncraft, too. I don't think the four of us could move her. We'll have\r\nrollers in readiness, of course, but we must cut a channel for the tide,\r\nand so make sure of floating her.... By Jove! _What_ a piece of luck!\"\r\n\r\nIt took them an hour or more to sober down. For once, Maseden's orders\r\nwere tacitly ignored, even by himself. Instead of helping in the\r\nconstruction of another hut the girls were busy with the lashings of the\r\ncanvas cover. Every true woman has the instinct of the good housewife,\r\nand these two could not rest content until they had examined and\r\nclassified the stores.\r\n\r\nNone of them could resist the temptation of a bottle of coffee extract,\r\nsome condensed milk and a tin of biscuits. The spirit-stove was\r\nlighted, some water boiled and they drank hot coffee and ate wheat for\r\nthe first time in seventeen days.\r\n\r\nTheir greatest surprise was the quantity and variety of stores on board.\r\nThere were knives and forks, enameled plates and cups, even such minor\r\nrequisites as salt, pepper and mustard.\r\n\r\nOf course, the chief steward of the _Southern Cross_ had been given many\r\nhours in which to make preparations. Being a resourceful man, when the\r\nlockers were packed with their regulation supplies he stuffed \"extras\"\r\ninto odd corners.\r\n\r\nPoor fellow! The pity was that an adverse fate had denied him any\r\nbenefit from his own foresight.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAlthough the castaways entered with good heart upon their second\r\ncampaign against the forces of nature, the immense advantages now\r\nenjoyed as compared with their condition on Hanover Island did not blind\r\nthem to the difficulties yet to be faced and conquered ere the haunts of\r\ncivilized man might be reached. There was no gainsaying the cogency of\r\nMaseden's logic; the absence of aborigines from a spot so favored as\r\nRotunda Bay (the name allotted to their new location), supplied positive\r\nproof of the impracticable nature of all approaches by sea.\r\n\r\nHow far the barriers might extend they had no means of knowing. They\r\ncould guess how forbidding they were from the character of the northerly\r\nchannel, and it was easy to believe that one such dangerous passage\r\nalone would not have deterred tribesmen accustomed to navigate these\r\nperilous waters.\r\n\r\nSo, in the intervals of labor, they gave close heed to the tides and\r\ntheir action. For instance, Maseden would knock together a small raft,\r\nlaunch it at high water and watch its subsequent course. He found, at\r\nfirst, that it stranded invariably. Then he took it to the tiny estuary\r\nof the second river, waited until the ebb was well established, and let\r\nit swing out with the current.\r\n\r\nThis time, as he anticipated, it was carried swiftly southward, and was\r\nseen no more, thus confirming his belief that the rise and fall of the\r\ntide set up a circular movement of an immense body of water always\r\ntending in the same southerly direction, retarded during the flow, with\r\nresultant acceleration during the ebb.\r\n\r\nOne day, when observation farther afield was desired, they all four set\r\noff soon after dawn, and were close to the southern narrows at high\r\nwater. Then, as the shore gradually became practicable, they followed\r\nthe receding tide until farther advance became dangerous. Seen from a\r\ndistance, one of the cliffs offered a not impossible climb, and closer\r\ninspection showed that, by hard work, and some roping, they could reach\r\nthe summit.\r\n\r\nThe girls, who had positively refused to be left \"at home,\" were now\r\nequally determined to make the ascent. The soles of their light boots\r\nhad long since given out, but each and all now wore moccasins of\r\nsealskin, and very serviceable and comfortable footgear these proved,\r\nbeing impervious to the jars of the roughest rock surface, and most\r\nexcellent for climbing.\r\n\r\nAfter an hour's hard work they stood on a narrow saddle overlooking\r\na seaward precipice, and the vista before their eyes was at once\r\nawe-inspiring and disheartening. Mile after mile, nothing but broken\r\nwater met the eye. The reefs were countless. In fact, the resistance\r\nthey offered to the incoming tide direct from the Pacific was such that,\r\nin all likelihood, it accounted for the delay which set up the\r\nextraordinary race past Hell Gate.\r\n\r\nEven Sturgess was upset by the far-flung chaos. A strong wind was\r\nblowing up there, and he sank his voice in the hope that his words\r\nwould reach Maseden only.\r\n\r\n\"Rotten!\" he said. \"It would knock the stuffing out of a brass dog.\"\r\n\r\n\"No secrets, please,\" cried Madge promptly. \"What did you say, C. K.?\r\nAre you telling Alec that there is no way out?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yep,\" was the disconsolate reply.\r\n\r\n\"We have not quite determined that fact yet,\" said Maseden coolly.\r\n\"Having done a stiff climb, suppose we get our money's worth, and sit\r\ndown? Never mind the unpleasant prospect in front. Let's keep a sharp\r\nlook-out for a log traveling in mid-stream, and watch it as long as\r\npossible.\"\r\n\r\nNina, who was endowed with excellent good sight, was the first to detect\r\na nearly submerged tree-trunk bobbing about in the channel, nearly a\r\nmile distant. The atmosphere happened, however, to be unusually clear\r\nthat day, so they could follow the progress of the derelict for another\r\nmile or more. As soon as it emerged from the actual channel between the\r\ntwo headlands, it swung away to the left, or eastward, and kept on that\r\ncourse until lost in the waste of waters.\r\n\r\nMaseden whistled in sheer vexation when he gave up the attempt to follow\r\nthis floating index any longer.\r\n\r\n\"What is it now, son?\" inquired Sturgess.\r\n\r\n\"The worst,\" snapped the other vindictively.\r\n\r\n\"Great Scott! Didn't you like the look of that log. I thought it\r\nlolloped along in a devil-may-care style that was rather attractive.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it turned towards the land, and not towards the sea.\"\r\n\r\n\"I guess that's so.\"\r\n\r\n\"And doesn't that convey any meaning to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure. The tides hereabouts go all ways for Sundays. Before that thing\r\nreaches Nelson Straits it has to round the eastern end of the island\r\nopposite.... Yes, yes, Alec. You've wised me up on heaps of things\r\nI didn't give a hooraw in Hades for at one time. I can tell the time\r\nby the sun, skin an eel, or a seal, or a teal, open oysters like\r\na bar-keep, and read an eddy like a Mississippi pilot. And, to my\r\nreckoning, our boat, or any boat, has as much chance of winning through\r\nthat proposition out there as a lump of butter in a fiery furnace. I\r\nnever did hold very strongly by that story about Shadrack, Mesack and\r\nAbednego. I've a notion we haven't got the complete facts. One day in\r\nPittsburg--\"\r\n\r\n\"Silence, please, for the passing of the next log, which happens to be\r\na boat!\"\r\n\r\nNina's voice rang out clearly. She well knew the astounding significance\r\nof the words, but the daily round of hardship and adventure were molding\r\nher character on new and stronger lines. She was not, nor ever could be\r\nagain, the somewhat conventional young lady who had sailed from San Juan\r\nlittle more than a month ago. She could face now, with an unflinching\r\nand critical eye, perils which then would have blanched her cheek and\r\nset the blood pulsing in her veins.\r\n\r\nEven her sister, who had not made out the object to which Nina had\r\ncalled attention, put an alarming question quite calmly.\r\n\r\n\"A boat!\" she cried. \"Oh, Nina, not _our_ boat?\"\r\n\r\nSo many seemingly impossible things had occurred that the stout\r\nlife-boat they left tied securely in a small dock which was flooded\r\nby each tide might conceivably have broken loose.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" came the reassuring answer. \"Not our boat. It looks like one of\r\nthe native coracles Alec has told us of. But it is empty. At any rate,\r\nthere is no one sitting upright in it.\"\r\n\r\nBy this time the others had seen the craft, which she was the first to\r\ndetect. In their anxiety and excitement they stood up, one by one, as\r\nthough the couple of feet thus gained would give a better view-point.\r\nThere could not be the least doubt that they were looking at a\r\nroughly-fashioned but distinctly seaworthy boat, which danced along on\r\nthe crest of a rapid current, and whirled around, as though in sport,\r\nwhen some black rock thrust its obstructing fangs into the tide-way.\r\nApparently, it was traveling quite safely.\r\n\r\nThen, as if to give them a really useful object lesson, it was caught\r\nbetween two rocks and turned clean over. A second somersault righted\r\nit, and, like the log, it sped away to the east.\r\n\r\nMaseden brought back the dazed and troubled wits of his companions to\r\nthe particular business in hand.\r\n\r\n\"See that you are properly roped,\" he said. \"We're heading for camp, as\r\nquickly as we can get there. Don't hurry over the first part of the\r\ndescent, however. There are two bad places on the rock face.\"\r\n\r\nThey reached the shore safely, unroped, and set off to walk three hard\r\nmiles in record time. As they neared their refuge they saw the boat, now\r\naground in its tiny canal. Near at hand were the white embers of their\r\nfire, which would soon be ablaze when fresh logs were added. Some\r\nwashing, stretched on a line, lent a strangely domestic touch to the\r\nencampment.\r\n\r\nBut the one profoundly relieving fact was self-evident. No party of\r\nmarauding Indians had swooped down on their ark and its stores. Wherever\r\nthe derelict boat had come from, its occupants were not to be seen in\r\nany part of Rotunda Bay. As Maseden put it tersely:\r\n\r\n\"We found it hard enough to get here. Others seemed to have tried and\r\nfailed.\"\r\n\r\nStill he and Sturgess decided to mount guard that night. The girls were\r\nnot supposed to know of this new arrangement, until Maseden was about\r\nto awaken Sturgess for his second spell of sentry-go. Then Nina emerged\r\nfrom the rear portion of the shack.\r\n\r\n\"Lend me your watch, Alec,\" she said pleasantly. \"I'll take these\r\ntwo hours.... No, you mustn't argue, there's a dear--fellow--\"\r\nthe concluding word was added rather hurriedly, being an obvious\r\nafterthought. \"I'll call Madge next, and it will be broad daylight\r\nby the time her spell is ended.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not sleepy,\" he murmured, sinking his voice so as not to disturb\r\nthe others. \"I was only going to rouse C. K. because he will be annoyed\r\nif I don't stick to schedule.\"\r\n\r\n\"I haven't slept at all,\" the girl confessed. \"If you're not going to\r\nrest, let us talk. Or, perhaps, that is not quite the right thing to\r\ndo.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not if there was any real fear of an attack,\" said Maseden, leading her\r\nto the small sand hillock near the boat. \"I am convinced we are safe\r\nenough, but I should never forgive myself if the camp were rushed owing\r\nto our negligence.... Sit here. The tide is rising. We can distinguish\r\nthe water-line, and remain unseen ourselves. Of course, we should speak\r\nhardly above a whisper.\"\r\n\r\nSome inequality in the sloping surface brought them rather close\r\ntogether when they sat down. Nina moved, with a little laugh of\r\napology. Her action was quite involuntary, but it nettled Maseden.\r\n\r\n\"I don't want to flirt with you, if that is what you are afraid of,\" he\r\ngrunted. \"In present conditions spooning would be rather absurd. Not\r\nthat my particular sort of marriage tie would restrain me. Don't think\r\nit. Enforced obedience of that sort is foreign to my nature.\"\r\n\r\n\"I gather that you really want to quarrel with me,\" was the glib answer.\r\n\r\nOf course, any woman of average wit could have put a man in the wrong at\r\nonce with equal readiness though given a far less vulnerable opening,\r\nbut Maseden realized his blunder and drew back.\r\n\r\n\"A too strenuous life seems to have spoiled my temper,\" he said. \"I used\r\nto be regarded as a somewhat easy-going person.\"\r\n\r\n\"Probably that was because you had things all your own way.\"\r\n\r\n\"You may be right. A man is the poorest judge of his own virtues or\r\nfaults. For instance, I have always prided myself on a certain quality\r\nof quick decision, once my mind was made up. But of late I find myself\r\nlacking even in that respect.\"\r\n\r\n\"Isn't it possible you are not actually sure of your own mind?\"\r\n\r\n\"Shall I submit the case to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Would that be wise? I would remind you of your own phrase--in present\r\nconditions.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I think you ought to know,\" he persisted. \"Weeks ago, on the day\r\nyou shot the sea-lion, in fact, C. K. told me he meant to marry Madge,\r\nif the lady is willing, that is. The statement startled me, to put it\r\nmildly. I rather scoffed at it, which nettled him, naturally. I was on\r\nthe point of acquainting him with the facts, but was stopped by the\r\ngun-shot. Since then he has never mentioned the matter again, and I have\r\nbeen averse from pulling it in by the scruff of the neck--\"\r\n\r\n\"Why do so now?\" put in the girl quickly.\r\n\r\nHe could not see her face, but the note of alarm in her voice was not\r\neven disguised.\r\n\r\n\"Because, day by day, I see more and more clearly that our friend's love\r\nof your sister is a very real thing. I see, too, or think that I see, a\r\nresponse on her part. From a common sense point of view, what else could\r\none expect? Two young people, each eminently agreeable, are thrown\r\ntogether by fate in circumstances of great and continuous personal\r\ndanger. The artificial intercourse of civilized life is impossible from\r\nthe outset. They see each other as they really are. Each has to depend\r\non real characteristics, not on shams. Can one imagine a more ideal\r\nmethod of choosing one's future partner than those in which we have\r\nlived during the past month?\"\r\n\r\nThis was what lawyers call a leading question, and Nina shied at it\r\ninstantly.\r\n\r\n\"Everything you have said may be true, Alec,\" she said, \"but you have\r\nadvanced no reason whatever for disturbing our pleasant relations.\r\nSurely all these problems may be allowed to settle themselves when, if\r\never, we re-enter the everyday world?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is just my difficulty,\" continued Maseden doggedly; he was\r\nresolved now to have an irritating hindrance to pleasant relations\r\nsettled once and for all. \"Is it fair to Sturgess to let him believe\r\nthere is no bar to his wooing? Of course, my marriage was a farce, and\r\ncan be dismissed as such. But what will C. K. think, what will he say,\r\nwhen he hears of it? Won't our silence--yes, _our_ silence--you cannot\r\nshirk a part of the responsibility--be open to misinterpretation? May it\r\nnot bring about the very catastrophe we want to avoid?\"\r\n\r\n\"I really don't understand,\" said the girl in a frightened way.\r\n\r\n\"Then I must make my meaning clear, even though it hurts,\" he said\r\ndeterminedly. \"If I tell Sturgess now about the Cartagena ceremony,\r\nthough rather late in the day, it is not too late; whereas, if I wait\r\ntill we reach New York, how astounded and mystified he will be by the\r\nlegal process which I must set on foot to secure your sister's freedom\r\nand my own! Why, the result might be tragic. If C. K. knows now, he can,\r\nif he chooses, seek from Madge an explanation of the whole mad business.\r\nShe may give or withhold it--that is for her to decide. But at least we\r\nshall all be acting squarely and above-board. I put it to you strongly,\r\nfor the sake of each one of us, that Sturgess should be told the whole\r\ntruth.\"\r\n\r\nFor a little while there was silence. Nina seemed to be weighing the\r\npros and cons of the matter with much care.\r\n\r\n\"I think you are right,\" she said at last. \"I differ from you only in a\r\nsmall but--to a woman--very important particular. Madge, not you, should\r\ntell C. K. what happened in Cartagena. It is her privilege. It will come\r\nbetter from her. In the morning, when opportunity offers, she and I will\r\ntalk things over. I am sure I can persuade her as to the course she\r\nshould adopt.\r\n\r\n\"Leave it to me, Alec. Before to-morrow evening C. K. shall have heard\r\nthe full story of that unfortunate marriage. He will tell you so\r\nhimself. After that, I suppose, your troubled conscience will be at\r\nrest, and the matter need not be discussed further until it comes before\r\nthe courts.\"\r\n\r\n\"I seem to have annoyed you pretty badly by raising the point now,\" said\r\nMaseden.\r\n\r\n\"No, indeed! It is not so. In a sense, I am glad. My sister and I are\r\nvery dear to one another, Alec, and no one likes to parade the family\r\nskeleton, even in such a remote place as Rotunda Bay.\"\r\n\r\nMaseden felt that he had bungled the whole business rather badly, but he\r\nsaw no advantage in leaving anything unsaid.\r\n\r\n\"What I cannot make out,\" he muttered savagely, \"is how I ever came to\r\nregard you and Madge as being so much alike. Of course, you resemble\r\neach other physically, but in temperament you are wide apart as the\r\npoles.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dear me! This is really interesting. In what respects do we differ?\"\r\n\r\n\"Madge is emotional, you are self-contained. She would have cried had I\r\nspoken to her about you as I have spoken of her to you, but you survey\r\nthe problem coolly, and solve it, probably on the best lines. Sometimes,\r\nyou puzzle, at others, vex me. You are ready and willing to confide in\r\nSturgess, but refuse me your confidence. I find Madge easy to read; you\r\nremain an enigma. I believe you would almost die rather than enlighten\r\nme as to the true history of my marriage.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, bother your marriage! Can't you talk of something else?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am prepared to talk about you during the next hour.\"\r\n\r\n\"How boring for both of us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Only a minute ago you welcomed my efforts as an analyst.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was mistook, as the children say. These personal matters seem\r\nineffably stupid when one sees the dawn appearing over the walls of our\r\nprison. We may never get away from here, or lose our lives in the\r\nattempt. It will be of very small significance then as to why a\r\nsorely-tried girl agreed to marry a man she had never seen, and who was\r\nunder sentence to die before the ink was dry in the register.... Still,\r\nAlec, I'm pleased we have had such a candid discussion. I have come\r\nround to your point of view, too. It is _not_ fair to C. K. to keep him\r\nin the dark. To-morrow, as ever is, if you don't work us so hard that we\r\nhave no time for chatter, I promise you that Madge shall tell him\r\neverything.\"\r\n\r\n\"And me nothing?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is implied in the bargain, is it not? Does it really concern you?\r\nYou were speaking for C. K., not for yourself.... Oh, no, we're not\r\ngoing to re-open the argument. Just let matters remain where they are,\r\nplease. I want you to satisfy a woman's curiosity on a matter of more\r\nimmediate importance. When do you purpose leaving here? Shouldn't we\r\nstart soon? At this season we have fine weather of a sort. Don't we\r\nincur a good deal of risk by each week of delay?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hullo, you two!\" came a cherry voice. \"A nice bunco game you've played\r\non me! There was I, snoring like a hog, while you were spooning under\r\nthe stars. Wise Alec and Naughty Nina! But wait till I tell your poor\r\ndeluded sister. A whole tribe of Indians could have crept up and\r\ntomahawked you where you sat.\"\r\n\r\nThey started apart, almost guiltily. Each shared the same thought. How\r\nmuch, or how little, had Sturgess heard?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nTHE DOWRY\r\n\r\n\r\nBoth Maseden and Nina looked and felt like tongued-tied children, and\r\nSturgess was not slow to note their confusion.\r\n\r\n\"Gee, if there was an orchard anywhere around, I'd think you two had\r\nbeen stealing apples,\" he cried. \"Sorry, Nina, if I've butted in on a\r\nheart-to-heart talk, but it's not often I can josh our wise Alec, so I'm\r\nbound to take the few chances that come along.\"\r\n\r\nHe little knew evidently how closely their talk had concerned him, and\r\nthe fact that he had not overheard anything which would supply a clue to\r\nthe topic under discussion was, in itself, a great relief.\r\n\r\n\"Nina appeared when I was about to call you,\" said Maseden quietly. \"She\r\ndemanded her share of the watch, and as I was not inclined for sleep I\r\nremained on duty. Of course that is no excuse for an inattentive sentry.\r\nI propose that you shoot me straight off and imprison Nina for the\r\nremainder of her natural life.\"\r\n\r\n\"I sentence the pair of you to rest until breakfast is ready. There's\r\nno appeal from the court. About, turn! Quick, march!\"\r\n\r\nNina hurried away. Maseden, thinking he would not be able to close an\r\neye, followed her slowly, lay down, and was soon asleep.\r\n\r\nThe boat's stores had revealed neither soap nor towels, so the early\r\nmorning wash remained a primitive affair. A pool in the stream was set\r\napart for the girls, while the men scrubbed among the rocks. Sturgess\r\naroused Maseden a few minutes before breakfast was ready.\r\n\r\n\"Come this way,\" he said, nodding in the direction of the boat. \"I want\r\nto show you something.\"\r\n\r\nMaseden noticed that the other man's hands and moccasins were soiled\r\nwith the whitish-brown deposit through which a channel for the boat had\r\nbeen delved. Then he saw that no small part of the said channel was\r\nblocked by the debris of a fresh excavation.\r\n\r\nNow, among the treasures on the boat were a couple of axes. Given an ax,\r\nsome spice of ingenuity and a fair stock of patience, and any man can\r\nfashion an astonishing variety of useful articles. Singularly enough,\r\nSturgess, who was gifted with the artist's sense of proportion, could\r\nhew a spade out of a plank more skillfully than Maseden, and he was\r\ninordinately proud of the achievement.\r\n\r\n\"What the deuce have you been up to?\" demanded Maseden at sight of so\r\nmuch misdirected industry.\r\n\r\n\"You wouldn't guess in a week,\" was the complacent answer. \"This morning\r\nI was standing around doing nothing, when, as the tide fell, I spotted a\r\nbulge in the right bank of our canal. I wondered what had caused it,\r\nafter our trouble in lining the walls with stakes, so I nosed around\r\nwith a shovel. Then I got all fussed up, and didn't care where I threw\r\nthe dirt.... See what _I've_ found, old scout!\"\r\n\r\nBy this time they were in the trench, from which the tide had only\r\nrecently receded. Sturgess's zeal had cleared away some two cubic yards\r\nof silt, and Maseden saw at once that a part of the hull of a small\r\nvessel of some sort had been laid bare. Moreover, a few blows with an ax\r\nhad removed sufficient of the rotting timbers to give access to the\r\nhulk's interior.\r\n\r\nIt was a most interesting find. An old-time craft had been brought to\r\nher last resting-place within a few feet of the spot where the _Southern\r\nCross's_ life-boat was embedded. Evidently in the course of years she\r\nhad sunk in the soft deposit, and probably formed a nucleus for a new\r\nsand-bank. At any rate, she was completely covered, and lay there keel\r\nuppermost.\r\n\r\n\"Have you been inside?\" said Maseden, eyeing the doorway broken by the\r\nax.\r\n\r\n\"You bet your life,\" said Sturgess.\r\n\r\n\"Was the air foul?\"\r\n\r\n\"Fine. I guess the lime hereabouts attended to that. Anyhow, I carried\r\nin a blazing stick, and it burned all right.\"\r\n\r\n\"Skeletons on board?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a bone that I could see.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you keeping back, then? You can't humbug me, C. K. There's\r\nsomething on your chest. Get it off!\"\r\n\r\nSturgess craned his neck over the edge of the channel to make sure that\r\nneither of the girls was near.\r\n\r\n\"From hints I've picked up now and then, when Madge felt she must either\r\ntalk or bust, I've come to the conclusion that old man Gray's death\r\nmeans poverty to that small bunch,\" he said. \"Now, _I'm_ pretty well\r\nfixed, and I guess _you'll_ never be hard pushed to buy a food ticket,\r\nso I want your brainy assistance to arrange things for the girls'\r\nbenefit. See? It should--kind of--make matters easy--when it comes to a\r\nshow-down.\"\r\n\r\n\"What have you come across? Spanish treasure?\"\r\n\r\nMaseden peered into the dimly lighted interior of the wreck. Apparently\r\nthe inverted deck was about four feet below the level of the opening,\r\nand Sturgess had broken into the after part of the hull.\r\n\r\n\"Let me go ahead and pass out the boodle,\" said Sturgess. \"I found it\r\nin a wooden box, which is clamped with iron, but it has nearly fallen to\r\npieces.\"\r\n\r\nHe lowered himself to what had been the ceiling of a cabin, and moved\r\ncautiously among a litter of rotting wood, evidently the furniture which\r\nhad once rendered the tiny apartment habitable. He came back with laden\r\nhands, and passed out a curiously shaped jug, or flagon.\r\n\r\nMaseden examined it critically.\r\n\r\n\"By Jove!\" he cried; \"this is Aztec work, and hammered out of solid\r\ngold!\"\r\n\r\n\"There's five more of the same sort,\" said Sturgess, in a voice cracked\r\nwith excitement. \"And _this_ strikes me as something worth while.\"\r\n\r\nHe produced a crudely modeled figure of a puma, the body in silver and\r\nthe head, feet, and tail in gold. The eyes and claws were of polished\r\nquartz, and were bright as when the ornament left the hands of the\r\nMexican lapidary who fashioned it. The metals, of course, were\r\ntarnished, the silver being black with age, but both men realized that\r\nthey were gazing at a splendid specimen of a long-forgotten art.\r\n\r\n\"How much of this sort of stuff is there?\" said Maseden, his imagination\r\nrunning riot as to the possible history of this unrecorded argosy.\r\n\r\n\"Twelve pieces altogether,\" chuckled Sturgess. \"Six gold pitchers, four\r\nanimals and two carved dishes, each of gold. I've rummaged around\r\ncarefully, and that's the lot. For'ard of this section is a hold, and,\r\nfrom what I can make out, it was loaded with furs and cloth, but the\r\ncargo is all mussed up with salt and lime.\"\r\n\r\n\"Show me one of the dishes.\"\r\n\r\nSturgess brought forth an oval-shaped dish, made, like the vessels, of\r\nsolid gold. On its broad rim were chased twelve weird-looking creatures\r\nwhich reminded Maseden of the signs of the Zodiac; in the sunken center\r\nappeared a very elaborate design consisting of four trees, a bird\r\nperched on the topmost branches of each. Long afterwards he learned that\r\nthis cartoon represented, in Aztec picture-writing, the four famous\r\nchiefs who founded the Aztec dynasty.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, he knew at the time that the hoard which Sturgess had\r\ndiscovered was of great archaeological interest, apart from the intrinsic\r\nvalue of the precious metals, itself no small sum.\r\n\r\n\"We ought to devote the necessary time to a thorough survey of the\r\nwreck,\" he said thoughtfully. \"Meanwhile what have you at the back of\r\nyour head about Nina and Madge? What did you mean by saying it would\r\nmake matters easier?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, suppose you and I agree to give 'em the proceeds of the sale,\"\r\nand Sturgess handled one of the jugs lovingly. \"There's sixty ounces of\r\npure specie in this pretty thing alone, I'll bet. Then, if it dates away\r\nback, the price goes up like a rocket.\"\r\n\r\nMaseden knew that the really important part of his question had been\r\navoided.\r\n\r\n\"We must think it over,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Think _what_ over?\"\r\n\r\nSturgess, whose face was on a level with Maseden's knees, scowled up at\r\nhis friend with such an air of indignant surprise that the other man\r\nlaughed.\r\n\r\n\"I am not planning a daylight robbery of two fatherless orphans,\"\r\nexplained Maseden. \"Our difficulty will be to persuade these two to\r\naccept their legitimate half share, let alone the whole of the plunder.\r\nShan't we give them a hail, and let them see the pirate's _cache_ before\r\nbreakfast? Because that is what it is. These things were stolen from\r\nsome Aztec shrine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why Aztec?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Peru is a far more likely place.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, if these utensils were not of Mexican origin. The signs on the\r\ndishes are the animal-names used in the Aztec calendar.\"\r\n\r\n\"Crushed again!\" said Sturgess, clambering out of the wreck. \"But say,\r\nprofessor, how did you ever manage to stow away those odds and ends of\r\ninformation? I'm your age, and not exactly a fool, but I never had time\r\nto read.\"\r\n\r\n\"You never made time, you mean. If you had lived seven years on a\r\nsolitary ranch you would be forced to buy books and read them. My\r\ninclination turned naturally to the records of the country I lived in.\r\nThe stories of the Spanish invaders in Mexico to the north and Peru to\r\nthe south were more romantic than any novel. You've heard of Captain\r\nKidd, the buccaneer, of course, but I suppose you know nothing of the\r\nWelshman Henry Morgan, and his exploits on the Spanish Main?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not as much as would go on a dime in big type.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Morgan would have made Kidd shine his boots if they had ever\r\nmet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gee whiz! Hennery must have been _some_ Thug.... Hi, Madge. Where's\r\nNina?\"\r\n\r\n\"You two ought to have been washed quarter of an hour ago,\" came Madge's\r\nwrathful cry. \"I've been looking for you everywhere. Breakfast will be\r\nspoiled!\"\r\n\r\n\"Madge is quite right,\" said Maseden. \"Breakfast is more important than\r\nloot. Eat first, and discuss the pile afterwards.\"\r\n\r\nThis sound advice availed him or Sturgess little afterwards. Both girls\r\nwere vexed that the discovery was kept from them even during that short\r\nspace of half an hour. They were placated, however, by being allowed to\r\nshare in the labor of clearing a sufficient area around and above the\r\nwreck to permit of its exact size being ascertained. It was only a small\r\ncraft, the keel measuring some fifty feet in length, yet, as Maseden was\r\ncareful to point out, the early navigators deemed such vessels large\r\nenough to cross the mighty Atlantic.\r\n\r\nWhen the tide rose, and the wreck was flooded again, it floated. This\r\nwas foreseen, and the expectant watchers had a number of stout poles in\r\nreadiness, with which they under-pinned the hull on one side. Thus it\r\nwas rendered much easier of access later.\r\n\r\nBeyond a couple of beautifully carved and chased rapiers, the blades of\r\nwhich were largely protected by leather scabbards hardened by salt\r\nwater, and a number of copper cooking utensils, they found nothing more\r\nof value. The cargo, which appeared to have been furs and mats of\r\npainted reeds, was wholly destroyed. The vessel had carried two masts,\r\nwhose stumps, broken off short near the deck, seemed to indicate the\r\nmischance which had befallen her in the Pacific. There were no cannon or\r\nother arms of any sort in or under the wreck, but as she had surely come\r\nthere by way of Providence Beach and Hell Gate, she had probably rolled\r\nover countless times during the journey.\r\n\r\nShe was built of oak. The bluff bows and high-pitched forecastle and\r\npoop dated her as a product of the early seventeenth century. No trace\r\nof a name was discernible, but the bulwarks had been torn off. The\r\nabsence of an elaborate figurehead was significant. She was a strongly\r\nconstructed, but not highly finished little ship.\r\n\r\nAs to her history or nationality, the only reliable tokens were the\r\nswords, which were Spanish, with Toledo blades. The copper cooking-pots\r\nwere Mexican. In a word, she was ostensibly a trader, and Maseden\r\nbelieved that the iron-clamped box containing the treasure had been\r\nhidden beneath the floor of the cabin, because the planks were broken\r\nwhere the heavy package had apparently fallen through.\r\n\r\nOne thing was certain. The similarity of the six flagons, the two dishes\r\nand the four animal figures showed that they came from an Aztec\r\n_teocalli_, or temple, of great wealth and importance. It was highly\r\nimprobable that any town on the west coast of Mexico contained any such\r\nfame. If, therefore, they had been looted from the interior of the\r\ncountry, a reasonable assumption was that some band of Spanish\r\nadventurers, finding the way hopelessly blocked to the east, fought\r\ntheir way westward, and actually built the vessel which should convey\r\nthem to far-off Cadiz.\r\n\r\nIt was a strange hap that laid bare their plunder to the eyes of four\r\ndescendants of the race which was destined to sweep them and their\r\nbarbarous methods off the high seas.\r\n\r\nAfter a day of hard work and many thrills, Maseden was moved to accept\r\nthe discovery as a good omen.\r\n\r\n\"I had in my mind to suggest that we should renew our voyage by\r\nto-morrow's first tide,\" he said, as they sat near the camp-fire after\r\nthe evening meal. \"Just as the Romans consulted the oracle before\r\nstarting on any great undertaking, so have we been given a happy augury\r\nby having thrust into our hands, so to speak, a notable treasure.\r\nFriends, I propose that we accept the decision of the gods, and weigh\r\nanchor in the morning.\"\r\n\r\nFor no assignable reason, the suddenness of this resolve seemed to\r\nstartle the others.\r\n\r\n\"Have you made up your mind, then, that the channel is practicable?\"\r\ninquired Sturgess after a marked pause.\r\n\r\n\"The only channel we know is practicable,\" said Maseden.\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean that we should return the way we came?\" put in Nina in an\r\nawed tone.\r\n\r\n\"It offers our only means of escape,\" was the grave answer. \"To my mind,\r\nif we attempt the southern exit we go to certain death. We have a roomy\r\nboat, a sail, and oars. By putting off slightly before high water we can\r\nreach the mouth of the gorge just on the turn of the tide. I think we\r\ncan get through without any real difficulty, and even beach our boat in\r\nthe open and shallow channel of Hanover Island which we were making for\r\nwhen the raft was swept out of its course. We have discussed the tides\r\nmany times, and we all believe that we shall find ourselves in the main\r\ntidal stream again on the other side of that island opposite,\" and he\r\npointed to the mass of black hills outlined against the eastern sky. \"It\r\nis only the 'lesser of two evils,' I admit, but it yields a possibility;\r\nwhereas I regard any attempt to navigate the southern avenue as\r\nabsolutely fatal.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why the rush for the morning tide?\" queried Sturgess.\r\n\r\nThen Maseden laughed.\r\n\r\n\"You have fallen a victim to the prospecting mania,\" he said cheerfully.\r\n\"Having made a good strike, you want to follow it up. I don't blame you.\r\nI believe this beach would pay well for digging. Before you were through\r\nwith the search you would have a fine collection of odds and ends. But\r\nI'm minded to be superstitious for once. That puma with the glistening\r\neyes has seemed to wink at me all day and say 'Get me and yourself out\r\nof this quick!' I don't want to impose my wishes on you others, but my\r\nadvice is: Start to-morrow!\"\r\n\r\nMadge, listening intently, nodded.\r\n\r\n\"You are always right,\" she said emphatically. \"'Whither thou goest, I\r\nwill go; and where thou lodgest--'\"\r\n\r\nShe hesitated, as though conscious that her tongue was running away with\r\nher. The quotation, though apt, was peculiarly infelicitous. It did not\r\nplease Sturgess; it reminded Maseden of an extraordinary relationship\r\nwhich he had tried in vain to ignore; it jarred on Nina Forbes's\r\nsensitiveness, because it recalled the promise she had made at dawn but\r\nhad not had any opportunity of fulfilling.\r\n\r\nShe it was who broke up the conclave abruptly by springing to her feet.\r\n\r\n\"If we're going sailing the angry seas to-morrow, it's high time we were\r\ntrying to sleep,\" she said. \"Come, Madge.... By the way, is there to be\r\nany more guard-mounting to-night?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and you have no concern therein,\" said Maseden firmly.\r\n\r\n\"Who's keeping guard?\" inquired Madge. \"This is the first I've heard of\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Alec has had an attack of the fidgets ever since he saw that empty\r\ncoracle,\" said Nina. \"But I'm the worst sort of sentry, anyhow, and you\r\nwould be no better, dear, so let us snooze selfishly, and be ready to\r\nhelp the men in to-morrow's hard work.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've never before known a verse from the Bible break up a meeting like\r\nthat,\" commented Sturgess thoughtfully when the girls had gone.\r\n\"Somebody might have heaved a tin of kerosene into the fire, the way\r\nNina jumped up.\"\r\n\r\n\"The words may have evoked distressing memories,\" said Maseden\r\nincautiously.\r\n\r\n\"As how?\"\r\n\r\nSturgess's alert brain was very wide awake at that moment, but Maseden\r\ncontrived to extricate himself.\r\n\r\n\"That famous phrase of Ruth's contains the essence of an otherwise\r\nuninteresting Biblical story,\" he said. \"If Ruth had not been so\r\nfaithful to her mother-in-law we might never have heard of her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was Naomi her mother-in-law?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Ruth, herself a widow, married Boaz.\"\r\n\r\n\"I guess I was sort of mixed up about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lots of people are,\" said Maseden dryly, and the subject dropped.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey were astir early and, when the tide served, put off with as little\r\nceremony as though they were going on a river picnic.\r\n\r\nThe boat, of course, was far more easily managed than the raft. By\r\nkeeping in the slack water inshore they contrived to reach the mouth of\r\nthe gorge about the beginning of the ebb, and their calculations were\r\ncompletely verified by the smoothness and safety of their subsequent\r\npassage.\r\n\r\nMaseden stood in the bows with an oar in readiness to sheer away from\r\nany obstruction in mid-stream. The two girls each took an oar, and\r\nSturgess steered, also with an oar, as the broad-bladed rudder ran a\r\nfoot deeper than the keel, being intended to act as a center-board when\r\nthe sail was in use.\r\n\r\nSo preoccupied were they with their task that they hardly noticed the\r\nspot where the cliff had fallen away soon after they had passed beneath.\r\nEven the canopied rock on which they found sanctuary after the loss of\r\nthe raft merely attracted a momentary glance. Madge, eyeing the fissure\r\nwhich had so terrified her, was about to say something when a warning\r\nshout from Maseden caused her to pull a few vigorous strokes.\r\n\r\nThey sheered past a flat boulder. A couple of vultures, scared by the\r\nunwonted apparition of a boat, flapped aloft, and they all saw,\r\nstretched on the rock, some portions of a human skeleton which most\r\ncertainly had not been there when they came that way little more than a\r\nfortnight earlier.\r\n\r\nThe uncanny sight vanished as swiftly as it came. None spoke. The pace\r\nof the stream was quickening, and each had to be in instant readiness to\r\nobey orders.\r\n\r\nAt this stage Maseden asked the girls to reverse their positions and\r\npull steadily. In consequence they were backing water, and thus checking\r\nthe boat's way appreciably. By this means they rounded an awkward corner\r\nwithout any trouble, and again their eyes dwelt on the towering hills\r\nand wooded slopes of Hanover Island.\r\n\r\nMaseden and Sturgess now began to press laterally towards the eastern\r\nchannel. Two possible openings were abandoned because of the ugly reefs\r\nsighted only a couple of hundred yards away. At last, when practically\r\nin the center of a two-mile-wide passage between the three islands,\r\nMaseden saw a long stretch of open water.\r\n\r\nShipping a pair of oars, and leaving the steering and general look-out\r\nto Sturgess, he called on the girls to pull in the orthodox way. The\r\nthree bent to the task. After ten minutes of really strenuous effort\r\nthey were sensible of a greatly diminished drag in the current. Five\r\nminutes later they were in slack water, and speedily thereafter the boat\r\nran aground.\r\n\r\n\"Hooray!\" yelled Sturgess, who alone had any breath left to celebrate\r\ntheir victory. Somehow, little as they had gained in actual distance,\r\nsince Providence Beach was only three miles away, they all felt that\r\ntheir chief enemy was conquered. They had profited by the initial\r\nmistake of keeping in mid-channel; they had learned a great deal about\r\nthe tricks and changes of the Pacific tides; they had secured a\r\nfirst-rate boat, and, lodged in skins as a portion of the ballast, was a\r\ntreasure of no mean proportions.\r\n\r\nSmall wonder that they were elated, or that Maseden's strong face\r\nsoftened into a smile of satisfaction as he drove the boat's anchor\r\nsecurely into a crevice in the rocky beach.\r\n\r\nBut he neither forgot the skeleton on the rock in Hell Gate nor failed\r\nto interpret correctly its sinister message, so it was his careful\r\nscrutiny that first revealed a figure lying on the shore at high-water\r\nmark about a quarter of a mile to the east. He surveyed it steadily for\r\na while until the others, too, saw it. Then he made up his mind as to\r\nthe only practicable course of action. He unhooked the anchor.\r\n\r\n\"All hands overboard,\" he said quietly. \"We must get the boat afloat.\"\r\n\r\nThey obeyed instantly. The girls returned on board, their task being to\r\nsteady the boat with the oars. Maseden took a cudgel, which he preferred\r\nto a sword, and hurried towards the prone figure. Sturgess followed,\r\nsome fifty yards behind, with the rifle, his mission being to cover the\r\nretreat, if need be.\r\n\r\nNeither Nina nor Madge uttered a word. They were becoming hardened to\r\ndanger. They knew full well that, for some unimaginable reason, a\r\nterritory hitherto closed to Indians was now open to them, and Maseden\r\nhad left his companions under no delusions as to the characteristics of\r\nthe wretched tribes which infest the lower coast and islands of Chile.\r\n\r\nBut the particular business of the women at the moment was to keep the\r\nboat in such a position that the men could jump in and shove off into\r\ndeep water without delay, and they attended to that and nothing else.\r\n\r\nWar makes soldiers, and the struggle for life had assuredly made these\r\ntwo girls brave women.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nRUNNING THE GANTLET\r\n\r\n\r\nMaseden was not greatly concerned about the dead Indian lying on the\r\nshore. What he really expected was a sudden rush of savages from an\r\nambuscade, since it was now certain that a party of natives had\r\ndescended on Hanover Island. Some might have escaped, but others had\r\ncome to grief.\r\n\r\nThe mere presence of a body showed that one, at least, must have died\r\nquite recently, while the bleaching bones passed in Hell Gate had\r\nprobably been alive two days earlier. Some vultures were already\r\ncircling high overhead, and he wondered why the birds had not begun\r\ntheir ghoulish task.\r\n\r\nHe could not recollect what manner of sepulture the aborigines adopted,\r\nbut, from every point of view, it was more than strange to find a corpse\r\nabandoned on the beach in such conditions, unless, indeed, some drowned\r\nman had just been cast up there by the receding tide.\r\n\r\nIf that were so, why did the vultures wait?\r\n\r\nHe was on the alert, therefore, for any suspicious movement among the\r\nnearest trees and tall grasses, and warned Sturgess to keep a sharp\r\nlook-out in the same direction.\r\n\r\n\"These natives are treacherous brutes,\" he said. \"They may have seen\r\nthat our boat was heading this way, and be simply waiting an opportunity\r\nto stick harpoons into us. Don't shoot actually on sight, but be ready\r\nto put a stopper on anything like an attack.\"\r\n\r\nThe words had hardly left his lips when the body on the beach moved!\r\nSlowly and, as it seemed, painfully, the Indian raised head and\r\nshoulders, and turned in the direction of the voice, finally sitting up\r\nsideways and using the right arm as a support.\r\n\r\nThen, as Maseden drew near, he saw that this was not a man, but a woman,\r\na woman so emaciated and feeble that the first astonished glance he took\r\nher to be middle-aged, whereas, in reality, she was not yet eighteen.\r\nShe was stark naked, and he soon discovered that her left leg was\r\nbroken.\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate wretch had dragged herself to an oyster bed, as an array\r\nof freshly opened shells testified; but there was no great supply in\r\nthat place; the water was too shallow. At any rate, Maseden had no other\r\nmeans of estimating how long she had been there; indeed, he gave little\r\nthought to that consideration, because the problem of what to do with\r\nher arose instantly.\r\n\r\nHe argued, however, that the members of her tribe could not be close at\r\nhand, since the merest instinct of self-preservation would lead them to\r\nassist one of their number rendered helpless by an accident, though,\r\namong these wild folk, an old woman might be regarded as of no account.\r\n\r\nHe spoke to her in Spanish, asking what had happened, and she appeared\r\nto have a vague sense of his meaning; but her eyes were glistening with\r\nterror and fever, and he could make nothing of a mumbled reply except a\r\nword that sounded like _humo_, \"smoke.\" She showed extreme fear at sight\r\nof the gun carried by Sturgess. Holding out her left hand as if pleading\r\nfor mercy, she collapsed with a groan.\r\n\r\nSturgess, of course, was as fully aware as his companion of the\r\ndifficulties raised by the discovery of this maimed creature.\r\n\r\n\"Well, by way of a change, Alec, I guess we're up against a mighty tough\r\nproposition,\" he said, scratching his head in sheer perplexity.\r\n\r\n\"We have only one course open, I take it,\" said Maseden, though he, like\r\nSturgess, felt that they might well have been spared this additional\r\nburden.\r\n\r\n\"That's so. But--are broken legs in your line?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have a notion that the bone-setter has to straighten and adjust the\r\nfracture by main force, and then bind the limb tightly, leaving the\r\nrest to nature. We have a spare oar. Chop the blade into two lengths of\r\nabout fifteen inches, and get the girls to cut narrow strips out of the\r\ncanvas cover. Bring me my oilskin, and what is left of the cover. We can\r\ncarry her in that. Leave the rifle with me--and hurry! On no account\r\nmust either Nina or Madge come away from the boat. Be sure and impress\r\nthat on them. We may have to run for our lives any second.\"\r\n\r\nSturgess soon returned with the improvised splints and bandages. He also\r\nbrought a tin of beef essence which Madge had found among the boat's\r\nstores and was hoarding carefully for such Lucullian feast when soup\r\nwould appear on the menu.\r\n\r\nWhen Maseden spoke of the remains of the canvas cover he had in mind the\r\nfact that the girls had fashioned the greater part of the coarse\r\nmaterial into divided skirts. Seals were not plentiful in Rotunda Bay,\r\nand the devising of garments had become a sheer necessity.\r\n\r\nThey persuaded the Indian girl to swallow some of the beef extract.\r\nAfter tasting the first mouthful she would have emptied the tin, but\r\nthis Maseden would not permit, because he knew the ordeal that was\r\ncoming.\r\n\r\nIt was a tough job, too. In a sense, it almost proved more trying for\r\nthe amateur surgeons than for their unfortunate patient. Luckily, she\r\nfainted at the first wrench. Then they set their teeth and pulled the\r\nbroken bones into their correct positions as well as they could adjudge\r\nthem. When the girl revived she was already clothed in the oilskin and\r\nslung in the canvas sheet as in a hammock, while the limb was bound\r\nimmovably between two roughly fashioned splints.\r\n\r\nMaseden imagined that this creature of the wild was, in all probability,\r\nas hardy as a cormorant, and equally voracious. At any rate, when laid\r\nin the boat, she gobbled up the remaining contents of the tin, ate\r\nravenously of ship's biscuits and salt beef, and drank a mug of coffee\r\nin a gulp. When she discovered that no more food would be supplied she\r\nyielded to an evidently overwhelming desire to sleep.\r\n\r\nBefore closing her eyes, however, she had something to say. She was\r\nafraid of the men, but obviously placed trust in the two girls, neither\r\nof whom knew a syllable of Spanish beyond the few phrases which all\r\ntravelers in South America must perforce acquire.\r\n\r\nMadge, having the gift of music, contrived to mimic certain words with\r\ntolerable accuracy, and \"smoke,\" \"boats,\" \"bad men,\" seemed, to\r\nMaseden's ear, to emerge from the guttural Indian accents. In one\r\nimportant respect, the wishes of the new addition to the party were\r\nquite understandable. She pointed to Providence Beach, indicated the\r\nboat, and made it clear that she counselled a prompt move eastward.\r\n\r\nAt last Maseden evolved a fairly intelligible notion of what she was\r\nendeavoring to convey. He believed, and rightly so, that she was telling\r\nher rescuers how a number of Indians had been attracted to Hanover\r\nIsland by the smoke of the castaways' fire. They assumed a wreck, with\r\nits prospect of loot, and, egged on by greed, had ultimately dared a\r\npassage hitherto regarded as impracticable. Some had been killed; others\r\nhad escaped, and were now on the camping-ground at Providence Beach.\r\n\r\nApparently the girl was warning these strangers against her own people\r\nand recommending a speedy flight to safer quarters. Oddly enough, her\r\nadvice coincided with Maseden's own views. By landing on that part of\r\nthe coast, and lighting a fire, they would be incurring a grave risk if\r\nthere were Indians about, since the few miles' strip of shore, difficult\r\nthough it was, would be negotiated easily by natives.\r\n\r\nThe abandonment of the injured girl he could not account for, nor was he\r\nsure the boat had been observed, granted even that Providence Beach was\r\nnot actually occupied by savages. But he was not inclined to take any\r\nchances. Deep water flowed yet in the main channel, and the day was not\r\nfar advanced.\r\n\r\nSo he and Sturgess shipped the oars and pulled until they were weary;\r\nbefore night fell they had met the rising tide, and made a good landing,\r\nnot on Hanover Island, but on the eastern end of Island Number Two.\r\n\r\nThey slept in the boat as best they could, the men taking turns at\r\nmounting guard, as in addition to the now somewhat improbable chance of\r\nbeing attacked, their craft had to be maneuvered into slack water as the\r\ntide rose and fell. They were all heartily glad to see the dawn and eat\r\na good meal.\r\n\r\nThe very smell of food awakened the Indian girl. Like a healthy animal\r\nrecovering from hardship, she was growing plumper and comelier under\r\ntheir very eyes. With each hour she shed a year in appearance, and her\r\nconfidence increased in about the same ration.\r\n\r\nWhen she discovered that Maseden alone spoke Spanish she tried to\r\nexplain matters to him. But her own knowledge of the language was of the\r\nslightest, and he was only able to confirm his overnight belief as to\r\nthe danger of remaining in the vicinity of their first landing-place.\r\n\r\nSingularly his close acquaintance with the San Juan _patois_ proved most\r\nhelpful. It occurred to him that this might be so, as the root words of\r\nIndian tribes throughout the South American continent have undergone\r\nfewer changes than would have been the case among civilized peoples.\r\nMany were in use among the Spanish half-castes on the ranch, and this\r\naborigine grasped their meaning at once. Good linguist though he was,\r\nhowever, Maseden failed to extract more than a glimmering of sense from\r\nher uncouth accents.\r\n\r\nBut none could fail to be impressed by her relief when the boat was\r\nafloat and traveling east. They soon quitted the channel between the\r\nislands and entered the wide expanse of Nelson Straits. The weather was\r\nfine, and a steady wind from the southwest encouraged Maseden to rig the\r\nsail.\r\n\r\nHaving a wholesome respect for the Pacific tides, he meant to hug the\r\ncoast of Hanover Island. But after studying the clouds intently for an\r\nhour, the Indian girl signified that she wished to be lifted in her\r\nhammock. She then pointed to some small islands just distinguishable on\r\nthe horizon, and apparently situated in the middle of the straits.\r\n\r\nShe saw the hesitancy in Maseden's face, and by this time had evidently\r\nsingled him out as the leader of the party. Then she turned to Nina\r\nForbes, and her gestures said as plainly, no doubt, as her words:\r\n\r\n\"If _I_ can't persuade him, perhaps _you_ can. Tell him to take the\r\ncourse I recommend.\"\r\n\r\nFor some reason Nina's cheeks grew scarlet under the brown tan of\r\nconstant exposure to the weather, nor did a pronounced wink by Sturgess\r\nat Madge tend to restore her composure. But she met the Indian girl's\r\nappeal with seeming nonchalance and bravely ignored the obvious\r\ninference.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose she thinks that I may exercise some influence in the matter,\r\nAlec,\" she said, striving in vain to suppress a nervous little laugh. \"I\r\ndo honestly believe she means well. She is extraordinarily grateful to\r\nus. I have been watching her, and there is a dog-like devotion in her\r\neyes when we render any little service that is reassuring.\"\r\n\r\n\"Those islets out there may be bare rocks,\" protested Maseden. He had\r\nlittle knowledge of sailing boats, and hesitated at a long trip in these\r\nfickle waters.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps that is why she wishes us to go that way. They lie due east,\r\nand that is something in their favor.\"\r\n\r\nStill was he dubious, largely owing to the intervening stretch of open\r\nsea, but again he essayed to question their would-be pilot.\r\n\r\nThe girl was quite emphatic in her direction as to the course, and\r\nequally opposed to the more cautious method he favored. A good deal of\r\nthis was expressed in pantomime, but it was none the less\r\nunderstandable.\r\n\r\nFinally, finding that the others had faith in her, Maseden nodded to\r\nMadge, who was at the tiller, as the rudder had been shipped when the\r\nsail was hoisted; and the boat was put across the wind. The Indian girl\r\nsmiled, and was satisfied. They lifted her down to her place amidships,\r\nwhere her head rested on the package of treasure, and she remained there\r\ncontentedly many hours.\r\n\r\nLong before the violet-hued blurs in front took definite shape as a\r\ngroup of two fair-sized islands, with trees, lying among a great many\r\nstark rocks, sticking straight up out of the sea, the voyagers became\r\naware of at least one good reason for their guide's choice of direction.\r\nThe coast of Hanover Island began to fall away sharply to the northeast,\r\nand a wide gap opened up between it and the nearest land, a gap which\r\nmust have been crossed in any event.\r\n\r\nMaseden himself was the first to admit that they had been given sound\r\nadvice.\r\n\r\nLuckily the wind remained steady, and brought their craft on at a fair\r\npace against a falling tide. Nevertheless it was a long sail, far longer\r\nthan any of them had anticipated, and the shadows were deepening when\r\nthe men again lifted the Indian girl level with the gunwale to find out\r\nif she could recommend the safest way of approaching a particularly\r\nforbidding shore.\r\n\r\nShe understood at once what they wanted, and indicated a narrow channel\r\nbetween two gigantic outlying rocks. Though it was precisely the one of\r\nthree possible waterways which no stranger would have chosen, they did\r\nnot dream now of disputing her judgment. The passage was made more\r\neasily than they had counted on, and a second time was their faith\r\njustified, because a strip of white beach soon showed on the line where\r\ntrees and sea met.\r\n\r\nThe boat was run ashore, and a fire was lighted. The weather had become\r\nmuch colder, probably owing to the absence of shelter from the hills\r\nunder which they had camped during the past month. The Indian girl\r\noffered no objection to the fire. In fact, when laid near it in a sand\r\nhollow, she fell asleep long before any of them.\r\n\r\nThe boat, of course, had to be safeguarded, as they landed at low water.\r\nWere it not for a fissure in the rock which permitted them to row fully\r\na quarter of a mile nearer high-water mark than would have been possible\r\notherwise, they must have devoted a wearisome time to the task of\r\nhauling her in as the tide rose. Fortunately, there was no heavy surf.\r\nThe reefs they had seen some fifteen miles to the westward had broken up\r\nthe long Pacific rollers, and the breeze was not strong enough to\r\ndisturb this inland sea.\r\n\r\nNina and Madge elected to sleep on the sand.\r\n\r\n\"You can have too much of a good thing,\" explained Madge laughingly,\r\n\"and, greatly as I prize our ark, I am tired of it to-day. Every bone in\r\nmy body is aching.\"\r\n\r\nThey had, of course, given up each skin and strip of canvas they\r\npossessed in order to render the Indian girl more comfortable during the\r\nvoyage, and a ship's boat can be a most irksome conveyance in such\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nWhen the tide was high Sturgess and Maseden, before they, too, turned\r\nin, rose to make sure that the anchor could not drag during the night,\r\nand Sturgess electrified his friend by choosing that odd moment to\r\nallude to the Cartagena marriage.\r\n\r\n\"Say, Alec,\" he said, \"you sure have had the time of your life ever\r\nsince you were hauled off to San Juan and sentenced to be shot.\"\r\n\r\nMaseden imagined that the New Yorker was merely referring to the\r\nincidents following the shipwreck.\r\n\r\n\"I don't see exactly how life has been more of a sizzle for me than for\r\nyou and the girls,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, come off it, Alec!\" laughed the other. \"You know better than that.\r\nBut I guess I'll have to hand the explanation on a tray. Madge and Nina\r\nhave told the facts about your wedding. Gosh! What a jolt it must have\r\ngiven you to find your wife on board the _Southern Cross_!\"\r\n\r\n\"You _know_?\" gasped Maseden.\r\n\r\n\"Yep. They up and told me while you were gathering fire-wood. Nina said\r\nshe had promised you to put the full hand on the table at the first\r\nopportunity. She's done it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nina! Didn't Madge say anything?\"\r\n\r\n\"You bet your life. She was tickled to death. It's been worrying her no\r\nend.\"\r\n\r\n\"May I ask--\"\r\n\r\n\"No, you mayn't. It was square of you, Alec, to insist that I should\r\ncome in on the inside track. Of course, I wasn't born and bred in little\r\nold New York for nothing, and I had my doubts a while back. One day,\r\ntoo, you were within an ace of blurting out the whole yarn. I remember\r\nit well. I'm glad now you didn't. It would have made things kind of\r\ndifficult for me. But both girls are a bit shy where you're concerned.\r\nYou don't blame 'em, do you?\"\r\n\r\nMaseden was absolutely bewildered. Sturgess was an irresponsible,\r\ndevil-may-care fellow in many respects, but these effervescent qualities\r\ncloaked a fine sensibility, and it was astounding to find him treating\r\nthe matter so lightly.\r\n\r\n\"I--I hardly know what to say,\" he stammered.\r\n\r\n\"Say nothing. The tangle will straighten out in time. We're going to win\r\nthrough all right, so let us forget the San Juan affair till it\r\novertakes us. You ain't going to switch off from Nina on to Madge, I\r\nguess, so you and I won't quarrel, and the other kinks in the chain will\r\nsort themselves if we all go easy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell me this. What was the cause of the marriage?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't _know_?\" Each word was a crescendo of astonishment.\r\n\r\n\"No. What business is it of mine, anyhow?\"\r\n\r\n\"But you yourself have told me that you mean to marry Madge.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure as death.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yet--\"\r\n\r\n\"Sorry, Alec. I've promised to keep mum. Suppose we leave it at that.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is there to keep mum about?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hanged if _I_ can tell you, though you yourself haven't been what you\r\nmight call bursting with information during the past month.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was a woman's secret, C. K.\"\r\n\r\n\"And that's just how I size it up at this sitting.\"\r\n\r\nSturgess's logic was unanswerable, but Maseden was in high dudgeon as\r\nhe strode back to the camp-fire. He was far more angry with Nina than\r\nwith Madge. He suspected that Madge simply followed her sister's\r\ninstructions, and the injustice of this steady refusal of confidence\r\nwas aggravated by the fact that Sturgess seemed to know more about the\r\nins and outs of the affair now than he did.\r\n\r\nTrue, the New Yorker said he was still in ignorance of the motive which\r\nled up to the marriage, yet he had hinted at the possession of knowledge\r\nwithheld from the man who had saved their lives not once but a dozen\r\ntimes. Nina was to blame. Maseden was certain of that. He would have\r\nliked to shake her.\r\n\r\nAs it happened, she was either sound asleep or pretending it, so he,\r\ntoo, curled up in the sand and slept till long after dawn.\r\n\r\nThe new day began with an unexpected difficulty. The Indian girl was\r\ncheerful as a grig during breakfast. She ascertained their names, which\r\nshe pronounced fairly well. \"Nina\" she had no trouble with. \"Madge\" she\r\nmade into \"Mad-je.\" Maseden was \"Ah-lek,\" and Sturgess \"See-ke.\" Her\r\nown name had a barbarous sound, if, indeed, it was a name at all; so\r\nMadge christened her \"Topsy,\" which seemed to please her. But her\r\nlight-heartedness vanished when she saw preparations being made to renew\r\nthe voyage. She protested volubly, pointed to a colony of seals and\r\nwell-filled beds of oysters, and generally implied an earnest desire to\r\nremain on the island.\r\n\r\nEastward, it would appear, were other \"bad men\" and \"much smoke,\" but,\r\nwhatsoever her motive, Maseden sternly overruled her. She was greatly\r\ndistressed when placed on board the boat, and sulked for a couple of\r\nhours. As the coast drew near, however, she evinced renewed anxiety, and\r\nsignified that she would act as pilot again.\r\n\r\nThe land seemed to be a replica of seaward islands; a fast-running tidal\r\nstream passed due east between two gaunt promontories. According to\r\nMaseden's reckoning the straits they were now entering should open into\r\nSmyth's Channel, and he bent his wits to the task of getting Topsy to\r\nunderstand that he wanted to meet one of the big ships which follow that\r\nroute.\r\n\r\nHe believed she understood, but there could be no doubting she was so\r\ndeeply concerned as to the probable whereabouts of the inhabitants of\r\nthe coast region that she gave little heed to the wishes of her\r\nrescuers.\r\n\r\nOblivious of the pain she must be enduring, she contrived to\r\nperch herself in the bows, and scanned each bay and inlet of the\r\never-narrowing passage, though this was no subsidiary channel, but a\r\ndeep and swift tide-way. The wind was strong and favorable and the boat\r\nwas traveling fully eight knots an hour, a speed which no native craft\r\ncould hope to rival. Still, Topsy's marked uneasiness led Maseden to\r\nexamine the rifle and make sure that its mechanism was in good order\r\nand the magazine charged.\r\n\r\nHe had no definite notion as to the type of weapons used by the Indians.\r\nNearly all savages are armed with spears and clubs, but he believed\r\nthat a people so low in the social scale as these South American nomads\r\nwould not possess firearms. At any rate, he bade all hands keep a sharp\r\nlook-out, and specifically ordered Sturgess and the girls to take cover\r\nin the event of an attack, unless an actual attempt was made to board\r\nthe boat, in which case the girls could thrust with the rapiers and\r\nSturgess might do good work with an ax.\r\n\r\nThey ran on several miles without incident, and were beginning to think\r\nthat their guide was, perhaps, swayed more by recollection of earlier\r\nsufferings than by any active peril of the hour, when Topsy, whose\r\npiercing black eyes were ever and anon turned to the bluffs on either\r\nhand, uttered a sharp cry and pointed to a low cliff overhanging a bay\r\nthey had just passed on the left.\r\n\r\nThree thin columns of smoke were ascending from its summit.\r\n\r\nMaseden could make nothing of her excited speech, but he understood her\r\ngestures readily, and took it that the smoke was a signal, while the\r\ndanger, whatever it may be, lay ahead.\r\n\r\nAnd, indeed, they had not long to wait for an explanation. From around\r\na point not a mile distant, and directly in front, appeared a number of\r\ncoracles, eight all told, and each containing two men, or a man and a\r\nwoman. It was clear that this flotilla meant to waylay them, and the\r\nterror exhibited by the Indian girl was only too eloquent as to the fate\r\nof the boat's occupants if they allowed themselves to be overpowered.\r\n\r\nMaseden disposed his forces promptly. Sturgess was given the tiller.\r\nTopsy was put back on her couch in the bottom of the boat, and Nina and\r\nMadge were told to crouch by her side until their help was called for.\r\nFrom the outset the Americans did not dream of attempting to parley.\r\nTopsy's unfeigned dread was sufficient to ban any such quixotic notion.\r\n\r\nThe coracles were strung out in an irregular line, covering a width of\r\nabout four hundred yards, and, in laying his plans, Maseden recalled the\r\nstrategy of a certain great admiral.\r\n\r\n\"Head slap for their center,\" he told Sturgess confidently. \"That\r\nwas Nelson's favorite way of attack. If possible, he always broke\r\nthe enemy's line in two, and I suppose it paid him. I think these\r\nheavy-caliber bullets will rip a native craft as though it were made\r\nof brown paper, and I should be able to sink at least four before\r\nthe others can close in.\"\r\n\r\nSturgess nodded.\r\n\r\n\"What Nelson says goes,\" he grinned.\r\n\r\nThe battle opened at a range of one hundred yards, and Maseden's first\r\nshot buckled the framework of the nearest coracle, so that it sank like\r\na stone. There was a spurt of steam as the fire which every Indian boat\r\ncarries reached the water, and two men swam away like otters.\r\n\r\nThe second shot struck a little too high. It whizzed through the craft's\r\nhide cover and lodged in an Indian's body, because the man yelled\r\nfrantically. Maseden fired again, and damaged another coracle.\r\n\r\nBut by this time he had made the unpleasing discovery that these light\r\nskiffs could be propelled very rapidly for a short distance. In each a\r\nman or woman was paddling with furious energy, while their companions\r\nwere using slings. Small, heavy stones rattled against and into the\r\nboat.\r\n\r\nSturgess was struck twice on the breast and left shoulder, and was only\r\nsaved from serious injury by the stout oilskin coat he was wearing. Even\r\nso, he went white with pain, but he neither uttered a word nor neglected\r\nhis task, which was to keep the sail filled and the boat traveling.\r\n\r\nMaseden had two objects in mind--to beat off their assailants and yet\r\nkeep sufficient ammunition in stock lest other Indians were encountered\r\nlater. He sank two more coracles, and had killed or wounded three men,\r\nwhen a flint pebble struck him on the head, finding the exact spot where\r\nhe was injured during the wreck.\r\n\r\nHe sank to his knees, and tried to say something. He believed he heard a\r\ncrash and some shouting. Then the sky and hills and swift-running waters\r\nwhirled in a mad dance before his eyes, and he lost consciousness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nTHE SETTLEMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nJust as before, when he awoke on board the _Southern Cross_ in\r\nsurroundings so bewildering that he gave up the effort to localize\r\nthem, his puzzled eyes now surveyed white-painted panelled walls, a\r\nbrass-bound port-light, and some tapestry curtains. At any other time he\r\nwould have realized at once that he was in a ship's cabin, but now an\r\nuncomprehending stare soon yielded to a torpor of pain.\r\n\r\nHe believed that a gentle hand adjusted a bandage on his head, and was\r\naware of a grateful coldness where before there had been heat and a\r\nthrobbing ache. Afterwards--he thought it was immediately, though the\r\ninterval was a full half hour--he looked again at the walls and ceiling\r\nwith something of real recognition in his glance.\r\n\r\n\"Glad to see you're regaining your wits, Mr. Alexander,\" said a man's\r\nvoice, a strange but very pleasant voice. \"Lucky for you you've got the\r\nright sort of thick head, or, from what I hear, it would certainly have\r\nbeen cracked twice.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Alexander! Who was he? And where was he? Where were--\r\n\r\n\"May he talk a little now, doctor?\" and Maseden would have had to be\r\nvery dead if he did not know that Nina Forbes was sitting by his side.\r\nHe turned, and even remembered to repress a groan lest some one in\r\nauthority might not grant her request.\r\n\r\nEven so the doctor was dubious.\r\n\r\n\"He must not be allowed to get excited,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Then may he listen to me a minute?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, if you really keep to schedule.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't move, Alec!\" whispered Nina, and there seemed to be a note in\r\nher voice that Maseden had heard only once before, though he could not\r\nrecall the occasion. \"We're on board a mail steamer bound for England,\r\nbut she touches at Punta Arenas and Buenos Ayres, so you must be 'Mr.\r\nAlexander,' not 'Mr. Maseden,' until we reach home. Don't ask why just\r\nnow. I'll tell you to-morrow, or next day, when you are stronger. You\r\nwill trust me, won't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Trust you, Nina! Yes, forever!\"\r\n\r\nHe looked at her, as though to make sure that his senses were not\r\ndeceiving him and that it was really Nina Forbes who sat there, a Nina\r\nwith her hair nicely combed and coiled and wearing a particularly\r\nattractive pink jersey and white serge skirt.\r\n\r\nHe thought that her eyes--those frank blue eyes he had gazed into so\r\noften--were suffused with tears.\r\n\r\n\"Why are you crying?\" he demanded, with just a hint of that domineering\r\nway of his.\r\n\r\n\"Not for grief,\" she said quietly. \"But you must drink this now, and go\r\nto sleep. When you awaken again, perhaps the doctor will let C. K. come\r\nand chat with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"C. K.? Is he all right?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"And Madge?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Not another word. Drink--to please me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll do anything to please you.\"\r\n\r\nHe swallowed some milk and soda-water; took a whole tumbler-full, in\r\nfact.\r\n\r\n\"That's fine,\" he said. \"Now I'll hold your hand and you'll tell me--\"\r\n\r\n\"You're going to close your eyes and lie still,\" she said firmly. \"If\r\nyou don't I'll leave you. If you do, I'll stay here.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm bribed,\" he said, smiling. Soon he slept, but this was nature's\r\nhealing sleep, not the coma of insensibility. When next he entered a\r\nworld of reality he found Sturgess sitting where Nina had been.\r\n\r\n\"Going strong now, Alec?\" inquired his friend.\r\n\r\nMaseden did not answer at once. He wanted to be quite sure that the\r\nwretched throbbing in his head had ceased. Yes; there was a great\r\nsoreness, but it was of the scalp, not of the internal mechanism. He\r\nsat bolt upright.\r\n\r\n\"Hi!\" shouted Sturgess, \"you mustn't do that! Gosh! The doctor man will\r\nraise Cain with me if he knows I let you move.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm all right, C. K.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're going to flatten out straight away, or I'll shriek for help.\"\r\n\r\nMaseden lay down. The dominant emotion of the moment was curiosity.\r\nPerhaps, if he kept quiet, Sturgess would talk.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, the New Yorker was much relieved, and said so.\r\n\r\n\"You've nearly hopped it,\" he explained anxiously. \"It was a case of\r\ntouch and go with you for two days, and--\"\r\n\r\n\"Two days!\" gasped Maseden. \"Have I been stretched here two days?\"\r\n\r\n\"And more. We were picked up by the _Valentia_ on Thursday evening, and\r\nnow it is Sunday morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Everything seems to happen on a Sunday,\" said Maseden inconsequently;\r\nbut Sturgess understood.\r\n\r\n\"Sunday is our day,\" he agreed. \"Now, if you don't butt into the\r\nsoliloquy, but show an intelligent interest by an occasional nod, I'll\r\nswitch you on to the Information Bureau. The doc said I might, just to\r\nstop you from worrying.\r\n\r\n\"When an Indian with a spit lip got you with a stone at about five yards\r\nthere were two coracles on each side of us. I suspicioned that the Thugs\r\nin them meant to spring aboard at the same time, which would have meant\r\ntrouble, so it was up to me to spoil the combination. I shoved the helm\r\nhard over and drove into the two on the port side. Our heavy boat went\r\nthrough them as though they were jelly-fish, and the sudden rise of our\r\nstarboard gunwale upset the calculations of the other crowd.\r\n\r\n\"Everybody, including you, rolled over with the sudden lurch, but Nina\r\ngathered herself together, grabbed your gun, stood straight on her feet,\r\nand said to me: 'Do you know which of these men hit Alec?' 'Yes,' I\r\nsaid, 'that joker with the criss-cross mouth. But you lie down. We're\r\nclear now.' Without another word she drew a steady bead on the\r\nstone-slinger and got him with the first shot.\r\n\r\n\"Then she attended to you. It seemed almost as though we had reached the\r\nlimit, with you lying like dead, and me weak and sick, because the\r\nslingers gave me a couple to begin with, and the Indian girl screaming\r\nfor all she was worth. Nina was just crooning over you like a mother\r\nnursing an ailing baby, so Madge came and took the tiller--not before\r\ntime, as I didn't know enough to run with the wind again.\r\n\r\n\"We missed a howling reef by a hair's breadth--missed it only because\r\nthe new course had taken us close inshore towards the north. Half an\r\nhour later we were in Smyth's Channel, and didn't know it, so we would\r\nhave been sailing yet into the middle of the Andes if the _Valentia_\r\nhadn't bumped around a corner. Since then we three have been setting the\r\nscene for you when you come on deck. The passengers are the right sort,\r\nevery man and woman among 'em all wool and a yard wide. Tell you what,\r\nAlec--I'd better warn you--Nina and Madge have fixed up a star turn for\r\nyou on your first appearance.\"\r\n\r\nSturgess paused to grin largely, so Maseden broke in with a question.\r\n\r\n\"Are we at sea now?\" he inquired.\r\n\r\n\"No. We're anchored at Punta Arenas. The girls have gone ashore to see\r\nthat Topsy is well fixed in a mission-house. The man who runs it came\r\naboard for mail. He talks Topsy's lingo, so now we know why we happened\r\non her. She broke her leg when one of half a dozen coracles was upset,\r\nand the brutes simply left her there to die, as they were in such a\r\ndashed hurry to go for the supposed loot of a wrecked ship. She will be\r\nall right here. I've attended to the financial side of it. They tell me\r\nthat a hundred dollars will make her a great heiress.\"\r\n\r\n\"What about my name--Alexander?\"\r\n\r\n\"Gee whiz! I was nearly forgetting. That was Nina's notion. She's real\r\ncute, that girl. She sized up the position in San Juan, and in case\r\nthere might be any difficulty while the ship is in South American waters\r\ngave your name as Philip Alexander. She remembered that there was a Mr.\r\nAlexander on board the _Southern Cross_, and it would be just silly to\r\ntry and pass you off as a broncho-buster. No one gave any heed to your\r\nclothes. Our collective rig was so cubist or futurist, in general\r\neffect, that your _vaquero_ outfit passed with the rest.\r\n\r\n\"The skipper is about your size, and he has sent you a suit. The girls\r\nare buying linen and underclothes for all of us in Punta Arenas. I had\r\nno money, so instead of borrowing from the other people I went through\r\nyour pants for five hundred dollars. You'll find a note with your wad,\r\nso that you can collect if I peg out before we find a bank.\"\r\n\r\nThen Maseden laughed, and was heard by the doctor, who was coming along\r\nthe gangway.\r\n\r\n\"Halloa!\" he said. \"Was it you who laughed, Mr. Alexander?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, doctor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Any pain in your head?\"\r\n\r\n\"Outside, yes; inside, no.\"\r\n\r\n\"Feeling sick?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sick. I could eat a pound of grilled steak.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll do! Wonderful health resort, that wild land you've been\r\nwandering through. You have survived the nastiest concussion, short of\r\nabsolutely fatal injuries, I've come across. I can't prescribe steak\r\njust yet, but if you get through the night without a temperature I'll\r\nallow you on deck to-morrow for a couple of hours.\"\r\n\r\nMaseden chafed against the enforced rest, and rebelled against a diet\r\nof milk and beef tea, but the doctor was wiser than he, and the patient\r\nacknowledged it when really strong again.\r\n\r\nOn the day the ship left Buenos Ayres he was able to dress unaided and\r\nreach a chair on deck without a helping arm. The boat which had proved\r\nthe salvation of the castaways had been hoisted on board, and that\r\nparticular part of the deck was allotted to the party of four. The other\r\npassengers were never tired of hearing them recount their adventures,\r\nand Maseden, to his secret amazement, discovered that Nina Forbes seemed\r\nto find delight in attracting an audience.\r\n\r\nMadge and Sturgess could, and did, stroll off together for many an\r\nuninterrupted chat, but Nina was always surrounded by a coterie of\r\nstrangers, some of them men, young men, frankly admiring young men.\r\n\r\nMaseden endured this state of affairs until the ship had signalled her\r\nname and destination at Fernando Noronha, whence there was a straight\r\nrun home. Then, disobeying the doctor, and coming on deck for the first\r\ntime after dinner, he found Nina ensconced in her corner alone.\r\n\r\nHe took her by surprise. She would have sprung up, but he stopped her\r\nwith a firm hand.\r\n\r\n\"No, you don't,\" he said, pulling a chair around and seating himself so\r\nthat his broad back offered a barrier to any would-be intruder. \"You and\r\nI are going to have a heart-to-heart talk, Nina. I've been waiting many\r\ndays for the chance of it, and now is the time.\"\r\n\r\nShe tried to laugh carelessly.\r\n\r\n\"What an alarming announcement,\" she tittered. \"Wherein have I erred\r\nthat I am to be catechised? Or is it only a lecture on general\r\nbehavior?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell you. While we were trying to dodge the worries of existence\r\nround about Hanover Island I gave little real thought to my own affairs.\r\nBut the calm of the past few days has enabled me to sort out events in\r\nwhat I may term their natural sequence, and the second rap on the head\r\nmay have restored my wits to their average working capacity. Perhaps it\r\nwill simplify matters if I begin at the beginning. The woman I\r\nmarried--\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you still harping on that unfortunate marriage?\"\r\n\r\nThe tone was flippant enough, but its studied nonchalance was a trifle\r\noverdone.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he said quietly. \"I promise that you will not be bored by the\r\nfacts I intend to put before you--now--to-night--unless you resolve not\r\nto listen.\"\r\n\r\nThere was no answer. Somehow, every woman knows just how far she may\r\nplay with a man. Had Nina Forbes chosen, she might have sent her true\r\nlover out of her life that instant. She did not so choose. Indeed,\r\nnothing was further from her mind. She did not commit the error of\r\nimagining that Maseden would pester her with his wooing and wait her\r\ngood pleasure to yield. His temperament did not incline to gusts of\r\npassion. She must hear him now or lose him forever.\r\n\r\n\"Of course I'll listen,\" she said timidly.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you. Well, then, my wife signed the register as Madeleine. That\r\nis not your sister's name.\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor yours?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yet you led me to believe that I had married your sister?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. You assumed it.\"\r\n\r\n\"What really happened was that you assumed the name of Madeleine. Nina,\r\n_you_ are my wife!\"\r\n\r\n\"In a sense, yes.\"\r\n\r\nThough the promenade deck was lighted by a few lamps, there was a\r\ncertain gloom in that corner. Nina's face was discernable, but not its\r\nexpression, and a curious hardening in her voice brought to Maseden a\r\nwhiff of surprise, almost of anxiety. Happily he had mapped out the line\r\nhe meant to follow, and adhered to it inflexibly.\r\n\r\n\"In the sense that you are legally Mrs. Philip Alexander Maseden,\" he\r\npersisted.\r\n\r\n\"I may or may not be. I am not sure. I used a name not my own. It was\r\nthe first that come into my head--a frightened woman's attempt to leave\r\nherself some loophole of escape in the future.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are mistaken, Nina. I know enough about the law to say definitely\r\nthat it is the ceremony which counts, not the name. You will see at once\r\nthat this must be so. If you married another man to-morrow, and signed\r\nyourself 'Mary Smith,' you would still be committing bigamy.\"\r\n\r\nAt that she laughed.\r\n\r\n\"I must really be careful,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"I only want to fix in your mind the absolute finality of that early\r\nmorning wedding in the Castle of San Juan. It makes matters easier.\"\r\n\r\n\"To my thinking it makes them most complex.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all. You and I have only reversed the usual procedure.\r\nCommon-place folk meet, fall in love, go through a more or less\r\nfrenzied period of being engaged, and, finally, get married. We began\r\nby getting married. Circumstances beyond our control stopped the\r\nnatural progression of the affair, but I suggest that the frenzied\r\npart of the business might well start now.\"\r\n\r\nHe caught her left hand and held it. She did not endeavor to withdraw\r\nit, but he was startled by her seeming indifference. Still, being a\r\ndetermined person, even in such a delicate matter as love-making, he\r\npursued his theme.\r\n\r\n\"You well know that I mean to marry you, Nina, though I have regarded\r\nmyself as bound to your sister until freed by process of law,\" he went\r\non. \"But I ought to have guessed sooner that Madge would never have\r\nallowed Sturgess to become so openly her slave if she had contracted to\r\nlove, honor and obey me. She might, indeed, have shared my view that the\r\nmarriage was a make-believe affair as between her and me, but she would\r\nhave held it as binding until the law declared her free. Then, that day\r\nin Hell Gate, when the hazard of a few minutes would decide whether we\r\nlived or died, you meant to tell me the truth before the end came. Is\r\nthat so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"You have no right to ask.\" Her voice was very low.\r\n\r\n\"I can answer my own question. You wanted to die in my arms, Nina, with\r\nour first and last kiss on our lips. Fool that I was, I was so concerned\r\nabout the height of a tide-mark on a rock that I gave no heed to the\r\nfaltering speech of the woman I loved. The next time I heard those same\r\naccents from you was when I came to my senses on board this ship. For a\r\nfew seconds you bared your heart again, Nina, and again I was deaf.\r\n\r\n\"You must forgive me, sweetheart, though such grievous lack of\r\nperception was really the highest compliment I could pay you. The notion\r\nthat I was married to Madge was firmly established in my mind, and I\r\nliterally dared not tell you that you were the one woman in the world\r\nfor me till the other obstacle was removed. Seldom, if ever, I suppose,\r\nhas any man been in such a position. Of course, there would have been no\r\ndifficulty at all if I had happened to guess the truth--\"\r\n\r\n\"That is just where you are mistaken, Alec,\" and the words came with a\r\nsorrowful earnestness that Maseden found vastly disconcerting. \"What\r\nwoman with a shred of self-respect would agree to regard such a union as\r\nours binding? Now, you have had your say; let me have mine,\" and she\r\nsnatched her hand away vehemently. \"I married you as part of an infamous\r\ncompact between that trader, Steinbaum, and Mr. Gray.\r\n\r\n\"My family is not wealthy, Alec. When my mother married a second time\r\nshe did so largely on account of Madge and myself. She lacked money to\r\neducate us, or give us the social position every good mother desires\r\nfor her daughters. But Mr. Gray, though a man of means, frittered away\r\na good income in foolish speculations. He was worth half a million\r\ndollars, and believed himself such a financial genius that he could soon\r\nbe a multi-millionaire. Instead of making money, he lost it, and the\r\nlatest of his follies was to finance Enrico Suarez in a scheme to seize\r\nthe presidency. The attempt was to have been made two years ago, but was\r\npostponed, or defeated, I don't know which--\"\r\n\r\n\"Defeated,\" put in Maseden. \"I know, because I helped to put a stopper\r\non it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, the collapse of that undertaking and its golden promise\r\nfrightened my stepfather. After a lot of correspondence between\r\nSteinbaum and himself he came to South America, bringing with him\r\npractically the remnants of his fortune. My mother was too ill to\r\naccompany him, and he refused to travel alone, so we two girls were\r\ngiven the trip. Naturally, we were quite ignorant of the facts, and\r\nbelieved he was merely visiting a little republic in which he had\r\nfinancial interests.\r\n\r\n\"By chance we arrived in Cartagena on the very day Suarez had planned\r\nfor the president's murder--and yours, too, for that matter. Your arrest\r\nand condemnation gave the conspirators a chance of repaying Mr. Gray\r\nthe money he had advanced. They were afraid he would lodge an official\r\ncomplaint, and get the State Department to interfere. But they had\r\nnot the means in hard cash, and it occurred to one of them--Suarez, I\r\nbelieve--that if one of Mr. Gray's daughters married you, and inherited\r\nyour estate, the property could be sold for a sum sufficient to clear\r\nhis claim and leave a balance for the other thieves.\r\n\r\n\"That is the precious project in which I, the elder of the two, became a\r\npawn. Mr. Gray terrified me into compliance by telling me that we would\r\nbe paupers on our return home. For myself I cared little, but when I\r\nthought of my mother I yielded. I am not excusing myself, Alec, though\r\nI little guessed the true nature of the bargain. I see now that Suarez\r\nand Steinbaum wished to avoid the actual semblance of having committed\r\ndaylight murder and robbery. They might justify your death as a rebel\r\nagainst the state, but they could not explain away the seizure of your\r\nproperty, whereas its sale by your widow would be a most reasonable\r\nproceeding.\r\n\r\n\"Please understand that I believed I was only carrying out a formal\r\nundertaking meant to enable my stepfather to recover money honestly\r\nlent. Even so, my resolution faltered at the last moment, and I signed\r\nthe register in my mother's name. And now I have bared my heart to you,\r\nand you see how--utterly--impossible--it is--Oh, Alec, don't be cruel!\r\nDon't torture me! I can never, never be your wife, because I can never\r\nforgive myself!\"\r\n\r\nAlec, the wise, as Sturgess had often styled him, showed exceeding\r\nwisdom now by letting her cry her fill. Never a word did he say until\r\nthe tempest subsided. Then he took her hand again and drew her to him.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me one thing, Nina,\" he said gently. \"What became of the ring--our\r\nring?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is tied around my neck--on a bit of ribbon,\" she sobbed.\r\n\r\n\"Then it shall remain there until we reach New York,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"But--I want--to keep it--as a souvenir--of all that has passed,\" she\r\nsaid brokenly.\r\n\r\n\"So you shall, dear one. You would never feel satisfied, anyhow, with a\r\nSpanish marriage, so we'll try an American one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Alec, I cuc--cuc--can't marry you. I'm too ashamed.\"\r\n\r\nHe laughed happily, and drew her to him.\r\n\r\n\"You can't wriggle out of the knot now, girlie,\" he said. \"But, just to\r\nbehave like other folk, we'll begin again at the beginning, and not at\r\nthe end. Nina, do you think you can learn to love me quick enough to\r\npermit of a real wedding when we arrive in New York? You and I have gone\r\nthrough so many experiences since we met that we can dispense with some\r\nof the preliminaries to courtship. Shall we fix a date now? Say three\r\nweeks after we land, or sooner, if matters can be arranged.\"\r\n\r\nShe lifted her tear-stained face, and her soul went out to his in their\r\nfirst kiss.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSturgess, when he heard of the latest development, \"got busy,\" as he put\r\nit, on his own account. He, of course, had been told the exact facts by\r\nNina on that night passed on the island in Nelson Straits. The upshot\r\nof the general agreement speedily arrived at was a noteworthy double\r\nwedding, at which, as a topic of conversation, the beauty of the brides\r\nrivaled, if it did not eclipse, their extraordinary adventures.\r\n\r\nIt should be said, as a fitting rounding off of a record of singular\r\nevents, that Maseden not only obtained the money held in trust for him\r\nby the consul at Cartagena, but the proceeds of the sale of the ranch\r\nas well. Enrico Suarez was stabbed to the heart by a maniac with a\r\ngrievance. Senor Porilla, an honest man, according to South American\r\nstandards, became president, and saw to it that Maseden's rights were\r\nsafeguarded. Even the wily Steinbaum was compelled to disgorge to Gray's\r\nexecutors.\r\n\r\nThe Aztec treasure was sold for a mint of money to a millionaire\r\ncollector, and this sum was settled on Mrs. Gray for life, with\r\nreversion to her daughters in equal shares.\r\n\r\nIf any one is really curious to ascertain the identity and whereabouts\r\nof Mr. and Mrs. Philip Alexander Maseden or Mr. and Mrs. C. K. Sturgess,\r\nall that is necessary is to visit a town on the coast of Maine any\r\nAugust, and keep an eye peeled for a ship's life-boat converted into a\r\nyawl and named \"_The Ark_.\" Therein will be found some very pleasant\r\npeople, and, with the help of the foregoing history, the rest of the\r\ntask should be simplicity itself.\r\n\r\n                              THE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSCRIBER'S NOTE:\r\n\r\nMinor changes have been made to correct typesetters' errors; otherwise,\r\nevery effort has been made to remain true to the author's words and\r\nintent.",
