The bottle from which they had imbibed too freely\r\ncontained a villainous compound that ensured their host a handsome\r\nprofit, set their brains afire, and degraded them to the level of the\r\nbeast. Not that their condition in life was much better than that of the\r\ndumb brute. Animals often enjoy more creature comforts, are better\r\nhoused and more kindly treated.\r\n\r\nThey were not really sailors, for in their long experience on the high\r\nseas they had never reefed a sail or hauled on a rope. Only too often\r\nthey never got so much as a glimpse of God's blue sky or the immense\r\nstretches of tumbling, foaming ocean. They were the galley-slaves of\r\nmodern seagoing--the stokers, the men with oily skin and heat-bleared\r\neyes, who toil naked in the bowels of the giant steamship, each crew\r\ndoing its \"watch\" of four hours in a dark pit at the bottom of the huge\r\nvessel, deprived of air and sunlight, firemen and trimmers working\r\nfeverishly in a maddening temperature of 140 degrees and over, thrusting\r\nand pulling with rod and rake in the insatiable maw of the raging\r\nfurnace. The hot blasts scorch the men's faces and blister their skins,\r\nyet they are compelled to keep up the furious pace. They must never\r\nslacken, for on their muscles and their nerves depend the speed of the\r\nship and the prestige of the line. So they shovel faster and faster,\r\ntirelessly, endlessly, the flying coal-dust settling on their sweating\r\nfaces and bare bodies until they lose semblance to anything human and\r\nrecall those lurid pictures of the Inferno in which Satan's imps, armed\r\nwith pitch-forks, thrust back shrieking sinners, condemned to\r\neverlasting torment, who are struggling to escape from the bottomless\r\npit. That the luxurious liner may break a record and retain the\r\npatronage of the millionaire passengers reclining indolently on the\r\npromenade-decks above, the unknown, unseen slaves in the hellish\r\nregions below must shovel, shovel, shovel, always faster, faster until\r\nat last nature gives way. Exhausted by fatigue, overcome by the killing\r\nheat, the man falls headlong. They pick him up and carry him on deck,\r\nwhere the pure air may or may not revive him. Perhaps he is already\r\ndead. His filthy, almost unearthly appearance chills the sympathies of\r\nthe fastidious cabin passengers. Who is he? What's happened? \"Only a\r\nstoker!\" yawns some one, and all go unconcernedly down to dinner.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe time passed and the men still loafed in the chandler's shop,\r\ndrinking and arguing. The day was already advanced, the active, busy\r\nworld without summoned them urgently to duty, at noon their ship would\r\ncast off her moorings and steam majestically out to sea, and yet the\r\nfour firemen sat idly in the evil-smelling den, noisy in drunken\r\nargument--all but one man, a big, athletic-looking fellow, who drank in\r\nsullen silence. Occasionally one of them would stop and glance furtively\r\nin the direction of the street, as if apprehensive that an unwelcome\r\nvisitor might suddenly put in an appearance.\r\n\r\nBut no one disturbed them, not even Schmalz, the proprietor of the\r\nplace, a fat, tousled-headed German, who found his customers too\r\nprofitable to quarrel with. As fast as bottles were emptied, he replaced\r\nthem, and that he sold liquor without going through the formalities of\r\nprocuring a license was evident from his catlike movements, the absence\r\nof any outward signs of the clandestine traffic, and his extreme care to\r\nkeep the inner room and its occupants well secluded from observation.\r\n\r\nThe outer shop was typical of the many nautical stores of its kind\r\nscattered along New York's waterfront. It contained everything a sailor\r\nneeds, from yellow oilskins, thick woolen socks, and blue jerseys to\r\nfried herrings, pickles, and mustard plasters. The atmosphere was heavy\r\nwith an agglomeration of different and conflicting smells--fish, tar,\r\npaint, garbage, and stale tobacco. From time to time customers dropped\r\nin, and Schmalz, shrewd and urbane, exercised his talents inducing them\r\nto buy, the while keeping one cautious eye on his open money-drawer, the\r\nother on his boisterous patrons in the inner room.\r\n\r\nFrom the street came refreshing whiffs of salty air and the roar of\r\nheavy traffic rolling along the busy thoroughfare. Trucks groaning and\r\ncreaking under mountains of merchandise, cabs filled with travelers and\r\npiled high with baggage, slowly threading their way in and out to trains\r\nand steamers, rickety horse-cars, crowded to the guard-rails, hucksters'\r\npush-carts, piled high with decaying fruit, bewildered immigrants, fresh\r\nfrom the Old World, nimble commuters from the suburbs hurrying to and\r\nfrom the ferries--all these, men, horses, and vehicles were tangled up\r\nin seeming hopeless confusion. Along the water's edge, where the\r\nfour-mile line of docks sheltered the world's shipping, arose a forest\r\nof ship-masts, with here and there gigantic funnels of ocean liners,\r\nbelching smoke as they made ready for their journey to the sea. From\r\nmid-river came the shrill tooting of mosquito-like tugs, and the\r\nchurning sound of ferry-boats as they glided from shore to shore.\r\n\r\n\"Naw, Jack, my boy, it's too blarsted risky,\" said decisively one of the\r\nfour, a short, stocky man, with a pock-marked face and cockney accent.\r\n\"'Tain't no good arguin' an' chewin' the rag any longer, ye know. I\r\nwon't do it, an' that's all there's to it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shorty's dead right,\" spoke up another of the men, as he drained his\r\nglass. \"We'd be caught, sure as yer name's Jack Armitage.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bah!\" grunted the third man. \"Wot's the good of kickin'? If it isn't\r\none thing, it's another--so wot's the use?\"\r\n\r\nThe foregoing remarks were directed principally at the big,\r\nstraight-limbed fellow who sat at the table in sullen silence, his face\r\nburied in his folded arms. He vouchsafed no answer to his comrades'\r\narguments. Lifting his head, he turned his bloodshot eyes on them, and,\r\nas if to show his utter contempt for their opinion, he shrugged his\r\nmassive shoulders and, picking up the whiskey-bottle, refilled his\r\nglass.\r\n\r\nApparently a few years younger than his associates, he was a clean-cut,\r\ngood-looking fellow with a smooth face, and regular features, and there\r\nwas something in his manner, an air of authority in the toss of his\r\nhead, which suggested that he might be fashioned of a different clay,\r\nyet his grimy skin and oil-stained, coal-blackened clothes indicated\r\nthat his condition of life was the same. His eyes were red from\r\ndrinking and there were grim lines about his mouth that prompted his\r\ncompanions to leave him to himself. They knew their customer.\r\n\r\nIn the stokers' forecastle Jack Armitage had made himself quickly known\r\nas a man whom it was unwise to monkey with. Directly he joined the ship,\r\nhe gave them to understand that clearly. The cock of the boiler-room, a\r\nbully who had heretofore run things to suit himself, rashly started an\r\nargument with the newcomer, and before he knew what had hit him, he was\r\na fit subject for the hospital. Quick to admire physical strength, his\r\ncomrades respected Armitage after that episode, and they nicknamed him\r\nGentleman Jack, because his English was straighter than theirs and\r\nbecause he appeared to have known better days. Sometimes they hailed him\r\nas \"Handsome,\" because of his shape, regular features and wavy hair. Of\r\nhis history they knew nothing, and seeing that he was moody and\r\nuncommunicative, no one ventured to arouse his wrath by asking questions\r\nthat he might consider too personal. Besides, no one cared. There's no\r\n\"Who's Who?\" in a steamer's stoke-hold. A natural refuge for the scum\r\nof the cities--for those wanted by the police as well as for those who\r\nhave failed--even a detective will hesitate to follow his quarry into\r\nthe red jaws of hell itself. To this, as much as anything else, the\r\nstoke-hold owes its reputation as the modern Sanctuary.\r\n\r\nSo they let Armitage alone. He did his \"shift\" along with the rest,\r\ngaining promotion first as coal-passer, then as trimmer, then as\r\nfireman. His services were valued because of his great strength and\r\npower of endurance. He could go on raking and pulling out fires long\r\nafter his mate had fallen back exhausted. But with his superiors he was\r\nnot very popular. Discontented, intolerant of discipline, mutinous, he\r\nwas nearly always in trouble, and, owing to his violent, uncontrollable\r\ntemper, quarrels were incessant even with his comrades. They feared him\r\nmore than they loved him, and perhaps this explained why his present\r\nattempt to induce them to desert ship just before sailing-time had not\r\nmet with much success.\r\n\r\nThe first speaker went on:\r\n\r\n\"They'll catch ye, it's a cinch! Then it'll go hard wid ye. 'Tain't no\r\nworser for you than for the rest of us. The boiler-room's bad enough, I\r\ngrant ye that, but it's a darn sight better than goin' to jail. What do\r\nyou say, Dutch?\" he demanded, turning to another.\r\n\r\nArmitage maintained his sulky silence. The man called \"Dutch,\" a\r\nlantern-jawed chap with red hair and a squint, expectorated a long\r\nstream of saliva on the floor before replying. Shifting his quid, he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"I guess Shorty's right, Jack. I ain't no fonder of doin' the suicide\r\nact in that hell-hole than ye is yerself. I'd quit right now, and never\r\nwant to see the sight of a bloomin' ship again. But we've signed for the\r\nvoyage, ain't we? We must grin and bear it for another trip. The law\r\ngives 'em the right on us. I'm goin' back now, before I'm taken back.\r\nWhat d'ye say, Bill?\"\r\n\r\nBill, already half-seas over, nodded in a stupid, maudlin manner. He had\r\ndrunk so much that he could hardly keep his head up, and the words came\r\nthickly from his lips:\r\n\r\n\"Desert ship?--hie! No, siree! Hie! Ye remember--Robinson, who tried to\r\nbeat it at Naples? Hie! They didn't do a thing to him--almost fed the\r\nbloody furnace with him, that's all! No, siree, no pier-head jumps for\r\nme!\"\r\n\r\nThe clock in the outer shop struck eleven. Shorty jumped to his feet.\r\n\r\n\"Say, lads!\" he exclaimed, with another nervous glance toward the\r\nstreet. \"The blessed ship sails in another hour. We'll be missed and\r\nthey'll be after us, sure as yer born. I'm goin' back right now. Who's\r\ncomin'?\"\r\n\r\nBill and \"Dutch\" staggered with difficulty to their feet. While Shorty\r\nsettled accounts with the urbane Schmalz, \"Dutch\" turned to Armitage,\r\nwho remained seated at the table.\r\n\r\n\"Ain't ye goin' back, Jack?\" he demanded, as he shot with expert aim\r\nanother stream of saliva into Schmalz's cracked cuspidor.\r\n\r\nArmitage raised his head and glared at them. There was a look in his\r\nface that made \"Dutch\" wince. Hoarsely, savagely he burst out:\r\n\r\n\"You call yourselves men! You're nothing but a lot of white-livered,\r\nwhining curs! You've had a taste of hell in that ship, and you want to\r\ngo back and endure another three months of it, because you haven't\r\nmanhood enough to put an end to it. I'll not sail, I tell you. They'll\r\nnever take me back, do you hear?\"\r\n\r\n\"Does ye mean ye goin' to desert?\" demanded Shorty, eyeing the big\r\nfellow with astonishment.\r\n\r\nThe other two men stared at him, open-mouthed. \"Dutch\" scratched his\r\nhead, and, to better conceal his emotion, let go another flyer of saliva\r\nat the cuspidor. Then, with great deliberation, he bit off another chew\r\nof tobacco, and said, with a nasal drawl:\r\n\r\n\"P'r'aps we might make so bold as to inquire of the gen'l'man what 'ee's\r\ngoin' ter do fer a livin'. I allus suspected he didn't 'ave ter work if\r\n'ee didn't 'ave ter. But if 'ee's come in for a fortune 'ee might let\r\n'is pals know summat about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I guess 'ee's gwine ter be a bloomin' bondholder and cut his coupons!\"\r\ngrinned Bill, in a feeble attempt at jocularity.\r\n\r\nArmitage bit his lip and scowled. He was in no humor for jests, and his\r\nhand moved dangerously in the direction of the empty whiskey-bottle.\r\nBill ducked and the other men immediately gave the table a wider berth.\r\nShorty cast another nervous glance at the clock.\r\n\r\n\"Come, boys,\" he said impatiently. \"We ain't got no time to lose. Stop\r\nyer foolin', Armitage. Let's get back to the ship, or there'll be the\r\ndevil to pay.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a moment of silent suspense. The other men looked toward\r\nArmitage, who did not stir. Shorty stepped forward and shook him by the\r\narm. Armitage jerked himself free with an oath, and, raising his fist,\r\npowerful as a sledge-hammer, brought it down on the table with a force\r\nthat made the glasses dance. His eyes literally blazed with fury as he\r\nturned on his comrades.\r\n\r\n\"Go and be damned!\" he shouted. \"Go back to the ship and tell 'em to\r\ncount me out. I'll go to hell soon enough without getting hell here,\r\ntoo. Don't worry about what'll become of me. I guess I'll be all right.\r\nAnyhow, I'm not goin' back, do ye hear? If I was a coward, afraid to\r\ncall my soul my own, like you fellows, it'd be different. But I ain't!\"\r\n\r\nShorty flushed up. He had been a champion light-weight boxer before\r\nthings went wrong and he took to the sea, and he resented this\r\nreflection on his personal courage. He had not yet had an encounter with\r\nArmitage, but he knew enough of the science of self-defense not to be as\r\nmuch intimidated by the big fellow as were the rest of his shipmates.\r\nAdvancing spunkily, he retorted:\r\n\r\n\"No man ever yet called me a coward, 'Handsome,' an' I ain't goin' to\r\ntake it from you. If it comes to a showdown, the coward's the chap as\r\ndeserts 'is ship, not the chap as stands by 'is signed articles.\"\r\n\r\nArmitage sprang to his feet, his six feet of athletic masculinity\r\ntowering above them all.\r\n\r\n\"Clear out! Clear out!\" he shouted, wildly waving his arms. \"Clear out\r\nbefore I kill one of you!\"\r\n\r\nBill and \"Dutch\" obeyed with almost ludicrous alacrity, and retreated\r\ninto the outer shop, but Shorty pluckily stood his ground. Before\r\nArmitage could lay hands on him, the cockney closed to the attack, a\r\nsinewy arm shot out like a flash, and there was a thundering smack as\r\nthe blow went home on Armitage's jaw.\r\n\r\nFor a brief moment the athlete staggered, but more from sheer surprise\r\nthan anything else. Then, with a volley of fierce expletives, he made a\r\nsavage rush at his adversary. The men clinched, arms and legs whirled\r\naround in a cyclone of dust, tables and chairs were sent crashing to all\r\ncorners of the room. It was all over in a minute. By the time Schmalz,\r\nterrified by the noise of the fracas, ran in to see what was the matter,\r\nShorty was lying on his back on the floor, bleeding profusely from the\r\nnose.\r\n\r\nWhile Bill and \"Dutch\" helped the worsted ex-champion to a chair,\r\nArmitage coolly readjusted the rest of the scattered furniture, and,\r\nresuming his seat at the table, bellowed at Schmalz, who stood,\r\nopen-mouthed:\r\n\r\n\"Don't stand grinning there, you blamed fool! Let's have some more\r\nwhiskey. This scrapping makes one thirsty.\"\r\n\r\nSchmalz hesitated. He stood in no little fear of his burly customer. On\r\nthe other hand, it was dangerous to let him go on drinking. There was no\r\ntelling what he might do. He looked from Shorty, who was trying to stop\r\nhis nose-bleed, to the broken glasses on the floor.\r\n\r\n\"I guess you haf enough alretty yet,\" he growled.\r\n\r\nArmitage struck the table viciously.\r\n\r\n\"Don't stand chinning there!\" he shouted. \"Bring some booze on the\r\ndouble quick, or it'll be the worse for you!\"\r\n\r\nWith a helpless shrug of his shoulders, Schmalz went after more liquor.\r\nShorty, partly recovered from the knock-out, staggered painfully to his\r\nfeet and made for the door, followed by \"Dutch\" and Bill. When he\r\nreached the threshold, the defeated fireman turned and shook his fist at\r\nArmitage.\r\n\r\n\"Yer'll be sorry for this, 'Handsome'!\" he shouted. \"I'll get even with\r\nye afore the day's out.\"\r\n\r\nArmitage shrugged his shoulders by way of answer, and the three men\r\nslouched out. As Shorty passed Schmalz in the outer store, he said to\r\nthe German in an undertone:\r\n\r\n\"Look out for him, d'ye hear? He's a bad 'un. He's not to be trusted!\"\r\n\r\nJerking his thumb significantly in the direction of the cash-drawer, he\r\nwhispered:\r\n\r\n\"He'd as soon cut your throat as not--for what ye've got there.\"\r\n\r\nSchmalz turned pale. Shorty went on:\r\n\r\n\"I've got an account to square with him. Give him all the whiskey he\r\nwants. Keep him here until we can get back to the steamer. They'll come\r\nand nab him. Serve him right. He's better out of yer way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ya-ya!\" exclaimed Schmalz nervously, \"But mach schnell, eh?\"\r\n\r\nThe men hurried away, leaving their irate shipmate to his own\r\nreflexions. For a long time after their departure there reigned a\r\nperfect quiet, which seemed all the more intense by contrast with the\r\nrecent turmoil. Schmalz, busy at his desk, absorbed in the arduous task\r\nof disentangling his accounts, gave no heed to his quarrelsome customer,\r\nwho, now that the immediate cause of his irritation was removed, was\r\ninclined to be more amiable. His sullenness of manner disappeared and he\r\nseemed even willing to argue amicably with his host the merits of the\r\nrecent affray. Schmalz paid no attention, yet the fireman talked on. It\r\nwasn't his fault, he insisted. Shorty had called him names, and he\r\nwouldn't stand that from any man. He knew what he was about. Flesh and\r\nblood simply couldn't stand that stoke-hold any longer. Only the last\r\ntrip, one of the men collapsed under the strain. Seized with \"stoker's\r\nmadness,\" he had rushed to the deck and jumped overboard. He'd had\r\nenough of such horrors. He'd die rather than return to the ship.\r\n\r\n\"D'ye hear, Schmalz?\" he shouted, to better attract his host's\r\nattention. \"I tell ye I'm through with seagoing. They'll never get me\r\nback!\"\r\n\r\nSchmalz, however, turned a deaf ear. He was unwilling or else too busy\r\nto listen. So, finding that he had no one to whom he could impart his\r\nsorrows, Armitage turned once more to the whiskey-bottle, with the idea\r\nof drowning them. The strong liquor soon had the effect of making him\r\ndrowsy. His head dropped heavily on his broad chest and his snores shook\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\nHe might have slept in this way for hours without disturbance, only\r\nSchmalz clumsily dropped a tray, and the sudden crash aroused the\r\nstoker with a start. Rubbing his eyes, he turned eagerly to the clock,\r\nand a look of satisfaction overspread his face. The _Atlanta_ would soon\r\nbe on her way to the Mediterranean. Half an hour more and he would have\r\nnothing to fear. They would have sailed without him. Then he need skulk\r\nno longer in this den. He could go forth a free man, at liberty to do\r\nwhat he chose.\r\n\r\nBut as his befuddled brain began to clear, he grew uneasy. He knew the\r\nboiler-room was short-handed. They must have discovered his absence.\r\nShorty and the others, in revenge, would be likely to peach on him and\r\nsay where he was to be found. The officers would come after him and drag\r\nhim back to that abominable stoke-hold. He knew enough of the shipping\r\nlaws to be aware that they had the right. He being an English fireman in\r\na foreign port, all they had to do was to go before the British consul\r\nand secure his arrest. Putting his hand to his hip pocket, he drew out a\r\nrevolver and regarded lovingly its polished surface.\r\n\r\n\"My only friend!\" he muttered. \"Let 'em come! I'll give 'em all the\r\nfight they want--more than they want! I'll put a bullet through my own\r\nhead rather than be dragged back to that stoke-hold!\"\r\n\r\nAnd if the _Atlanta_ sailed without him--what then? He had had enough of\r\nthe sea, that was certain, yet he must earn a living somehow. He hadn't\r\na dollar in the world, and he knew no trade that he could turn his hand\r\nto. His life at sea had unfitted him for anything else. Even if he made\r\nthe effort and let the whiskey alone, how could he seek employment\r\nlooking as he did? With no linen and in his grimy, oil-stained clothes,\r\nhe would be eyed everywhere with suspicion. Nobody would have anything\r\nto do with him. The world has no use for its failures, for men who are\r\ndown on their luck. The outlook was hopeless, for he saw no way to\r\nimprove his condition.\r\n\r\n\"It's easy to lose one's self-respect and sink into degradation,\" he\r\nmuttered bitterly to himself; \"and when at last you see your folly, then\r\nit's too late--it's impossible to get back. Pshaw! What's the good?\"\r\n\r\nWith a shaking hand, he helped himself to another drink, grateful to\r\nthe lethal liquor which dulled his thoughts. Yet, in spite of himself,\r\nhis clouded brain remained active. Memory slipped back ten years. If\r\nonly those years could be lived over again! How dearly he had paid for\r\nthe follies which had brought him where he was! Wild oats? Yes--he had\r\nsown them in plenty, and a damnable harvest he had reaped! Things had\r\ngone from bad to worse, until one day came the crisis. He was down and\r\nout, almost starving, without a friend to extend a helping hand. After\r\nhe had fasted forty-eight hours, and the river seemed to be the only way\r\nout, a barroom companion told him of a job as coal-passer on an ocean\r\nliner which was to be had for the asking. He jumped eagerly at the\r\nchance as a drowning man grasps at a drifting straw. At least, it would\r\nmean temporary food and lodging. He was strong as an ox and could stand\r\nthe pace, no matter how hard the work was. Besides, hidden away in a\r\nsteamer's stoke-hold, he reckoned out that he would be dead to the\r\nworld. No one would think of seeking him there. The brutal work and\r\nbrutal companions would help him to forget the past.\r\n\r\nFor five long years he had stood it, but he could endure it no longer.\r\nFive years of physical and mental torment, and the future--a hopeless\r\nblank. The old days were wiped out completely, every decent tie\r\nshattered forever. He could never redeem the past. He had joined the\r\nvast army of life's failures, which goes marching on, silently, grimly\r\nto perdition. The sooner the end came the better. He was weary of it\r\nall. The best way would be to make an end of it at once. He knew he had\r\nonly himself to blame, but, like most men who have gone to the devil, he\r\nheld society responsible. The world is without pity for those who make\r\nmistakes. The man who's down is given no mercy. They said he was\r\nquarrelsome, a trouble-maker. So he was. In all these years of suffering\r\nhe had steeled his heart to hate his fellow man. He detested the rich,\r\nidle class because he held it accountable for his present miserable\r\ncondition, and in obscure socialistic and anarchistic meetings in the\r\nslums of New York and London he had listened gloomily to the wild-eyed\r\norators' frenzied teachings of class-hatred. His sufferings had\r\nembittered him against the whole human race. He had fought his way\r\nthrough it all fiercely, because the whole world seemed in league\r\nagainst him, every man and woman his enemy. The only law he knew was\r\nthat enforced by a strong arm. The weaker had no rights. It wasn't his\r\nfault if he had to defend himself. He had given the world back what it\r\ngave him and with interest. That's why he hit back every time blindly,\r\nsavagely.\r\n\r\nWith an unsteady hand, he took up the whiskey-bottle and started to\r\nrefill his glass. His back was partly toward the door, so he could not\r\nsee the front store suddenly darken by the abrupt entrance of four men\r\nwho pushed their way unceremoniously past Schmalz and rushed into the\r\nroom where he was sitting. Two of the newcomers were ship's officers,\r\nthe others were policemen.\r\n\r\nArmitage was taken completely by surprise. He knew at once that they had\r\ncome for him. With an oath, he jumped to his feet and his right hand\r\nwent quickly to his hip pocket. But before he could draw his gun, the\r\nofficers and policemen threw themselves upon him and pinioned his arms.\r\n\r\n\"You'd better come quickly, Armitage, or it'll go harder with you!\" said\r\nthe senior officer sternly.\r\n\r\n\"What d'ye want with me?\" demanded the fireman hoarsely.\r\n\r\n\"You're under arrest for desertion,\" replied his superior.\r\n\r\n\"Where d'ye want me to go?\" stammered Armitage, his breath coming and\r\ngoing in short, spasmodic gasps.\r\n\r\n\"Back to the ship. Not as you're much good--only to give you your\r\nmedicine,\" was the laconic rejoinder.\r\n\r\n\"Back to the ship! Never while I live!\" shouted the big fellow.\r\n\r\nBy a superhuman muscular effort he threw off his four captors as easily\r\nas if they had been children, and made a dash for liberty through the\r\nstore. But he was not yet clear of his foes. Seeing him coming, Schmalz\r\nquickly put out his foot, and the fugitive fell all his length to the\r\nfloor. Before he could scramble to his feet again, the policemen were\r\nupon him, and soon had his arms securely pinioned.\r\n\r\n\"Quick, back to the ship with him!\" commanded the senior officer. \"She\r\nsails in ten minutes. We've just time to make it!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe scene on the dock just before sailing-time of an ocean liner is\r\nalways an animated one, full of interest and color for those having eyes\r\nto see. The huge steamer, freshly painted, all spick and span, laden to\r\nthe water-line with precious freight, her enormous funnels belching\r\nclouds of black smoke, with white steam hissing from every part of her\r\ngiant hulk, as if the imprisoned energy were eager to put its power to\r\nthe test; the air filled with the babel of many voices, smart stewards\r\nstanding at attention on the lower deck, ready to serve the embarking\r\npassengers, uniformed sailors hurrying to obey sharply given orders;\r\nofficers resplendent in immaculate white duck and gold braid, solemnly\r\npromenading the bridge, as if impressed with the weight of their\r\nresponsibility; excited travelers arriving in every description of\r\nvehicle; messengers rushing here and there with floral baskets and\r\nhot-house fruit sent as parting gifts; telegraph-boys bringing words of\r\nfarewell; tear-stained faces smiling _au revoir_, handkerchiefs waving\r\nand much shouting; policemen pushing back the spectators anxious to see\r\nthe last of friends and relatives; the crowd growing gradually smaller\r\nand the shouts more distant as the leviathan swings out in to the\r\nstream--all this makes up a picture which, once beheld, is forever\r\nengraved on heart and memory.\r\n\r\nThe annual around-the-world cruise of the palatial Blue Star steamer\r\n_Atlanta_, 17,000 tons, was always an event of more than ordinary\r\ninterest, and sailing-day never failed to draw a large crowd. In fact,\r\ngoing down to the dock to give a noisy send-off to those friends lucky\r\nenough to be able to make the delightful Mediterranean trip had of\r\nrecent years assumed the importance of a social function. The voyage\r\nbeing pre-eminently for health and pleasure, it generally attracted a\r\ngoodly number of well-to-do and congenial people. Many of the\r\npassengers, moving in the same sets in society, were already well\r\nacquainted before going on board, and strangers had no difficulty in\r\nsecuring introductions. Almost as soon as the anchor was weighed, the\r\nbarriers of exclusiveness were thrown down. Before the vessel had\r\nproceeded very far from port, every one knew every one else, and the\r\nship's company had become one big jolly family.\r\n\r\nThe passenger-list contained many names well known in society. Mrs.\r\nTownsend Lee, one of the leaders of New York's 400, was on board; so was\r\nMrs. Wesley Stuart, whose _musicales_ were counted among the most\r\ndelightful affairs of the season. Professor Hanson, the noted\r\nsociologist, was a passenger; so also was Mrs. Phelps, the wealthy young\r\nwidow whose recent bereavement had made her the target of every\r\nimpecunious nobleman in Europe. It was perhaps only a coincidence, yet\r\nstill a fact the significance of which escaped no one, that two\r\nstaterooms had been engaged--one by the Honorable Percy Fitzhugh, a\r\ncallow Englishman who had made himself ridiculous with a Casino\r\nchorus-girl, the other by Count Herbert von Hatzfeld, scion of an\r\naristocratic German family, who in a newspaper interview gave out that\r\nhe was globe-trotting for his health. Gossip had linked the names of\r\nboth men with Mrs. Phelps, and as neither had been at any pains to deny\r\nthat he was a suitor for the widow's hand, there was considerable\r\nspeculation as to whom was making most progress in her favor.\r\n\r\nBut the name on the list which excited most interest and comment among\r\nthe crowd of sightseers and seagoers who literally mobbed the big ship,\r\nwas that of Miss Grace Harmon, the beautiful daughter of the well-known\r\nrailroad magnate, whose debut in society two years before, at a splendid\r\nball given in her honor at the Harmon's palatial Fifth Avenue home, was\r\nstill talked about as the most brilliant and costly affair of that\r\nseason.\r\n\r\nGrace Harmon was conspicuous for her beauty even in a land famous for\r\nits fair women. Tall and slender, with aristocratic features and queenly\r\ncarriage, she was the typical Gibson girl. Women raved about her\r\nwonderful complexion, her splendid eyes, her magnificent hair, her\r\ngraceful figure. They went into ecstasies over her gowns, her\r\nbeautifully arched eyebrows, academic nose, dazzling white teeth, and a\r\nsensitive, delicately modeled mouth, that might have tempted Saint\r\nAnthony himself. Men looking for money whispered that she was the prize\r\ncatch of the matrimonial market, being the only heir to her father's\r\nmillions, and the more enterprising laid their lines accordingly. When\r\nshe went out driving or appeared in her box at the opera, everybody\r\ncraned their necks and stared rudely, eager to feast their eyes on the\r\npriceless gifts this favorite of fortune had received from the gods. In\r\ntheir cheap hall bedrooms, timid poets wrote love-sonnets which they\r\nmailed to her anonymously, expecting no acknowledgment, happy only that\r\nthey had expressed on paper what lay heavy on their hearts.\r\n\r\nSo far Grace had shown herself indifferent either to sentiment or\r\nmatrimonial ambitions. She had not encouraged any of the men who\r\nshowered her with attentions, and even with her intimates she declined\r\nto discuss what they declared to be _the_ all-important question. But\r\nthat eventually she would make a sensationally brilliant marriage went\r\nwithout the saying, and society wiseacres predicted that Prince Sergius\r\nof Eurasia, the most persistent of her suitors, would sooner or later\r\ncarry off the prize. The nephew of the reigning monarch of a bankrupt\r\nlittle kingdom in the Balkans, the prince had been well known in New\r\nYork and Newport for several seasons past as a dissipated spendthrift\r\nanxious to make a good matrimonial catch. Grace had disliked him the\r\nfirst moment she set eyes on him, and he had never succeeded in removing\r\nthis first unfavorable impression. On the other hand, such a match\r\ncertainly had advantages which to many a girl would prove too dazzling\r\nand tempting to resist. But Grace declined to be hurried into a\r\ndecision. She demanded time, and while waiting to know his fate the\r\nPrince was suddenly recalled to Europe. This was as far as the affair\r\nhad gone, and secretly Grace was glad to see the last of him, at least\r\nfor a time, although the well-informed press sagely gave out that it was\r\n\"understood in society circles that a formal engagement of Miss Grace\r\nHarmon and the Prince of Eurasia would shortly be announced.\"\r\n\r\nFully conscious of her power, well aware that her mere presence aroused\r\njealousy in every woman and admiration in every man, Grace would have\r\nbeen more than human had she escaped being spoiled. The spitefully\r\ninclined accused her of haughtiness and of carrying her head high. It is\r\ntrue that she was careful in choosing her intimates and quick to snub\r\nthose who were too ready to claim acquaintance, yet friends once made\r\nshe kept, and she was popular in her set. In the more private home\r\ncircle she was fairly idolized, especially by her father, who had\r\nindulged her every whim ever since she was born. Her mother, for years a\r\nchronic invalid, had left chiefly to servants the care of bringing her\r\nup, but to her father she was all that was worth while in life. The old\r\nman existed only for his beautiful daughter. Everything money could\r\npurchase--fine clothes, costly trinkets, smart automobiles were hers for\r\nthe asking. After graduating from Bryn Mawr, she spent two years in\r\nFrance, Italy and Germany, acquiring a superficial knowledge of the\r\ncontinental languages. On her return home she joined the social whirl\r\nand became proficient in bridge. In short, Grace Harmon was accomplished\r\nto the tips of her tapering, carefully manicured fingers.\r\n\r\nBrought up in the lap of luxury, never having expressed a desire that\r\nwas not immediately gratified, Grace discovered after a time that\r\nwealth, while useful, has also its drawbacks. Having everything, she\r\nwanted nothing. She found herself wishing there might be something she\r\ncould not have, so that for once, at least, she might experience the\r\nemotion of longing for the unattainable.\r\n\r\nThe plain truth was that Grace was no ordinary girl. She had more brains\r\nthan people gave her credit for. Although reared in the tainted\r\nhot-house atmosphere of society, with its degenerate amusements, its low\r\nmoral tone and trivial ambitions, she took little real interest in its\r\nshallow, vulgar pleasures. The women she soon discovered to be\r\nempty-headed or frankly immoral; the men were, for the most part,\r\nlibertines, gamblers, fortune-hunters. The homage paid to her beauty\r\nflattered her vanity, but once the novelty of her first two seasons had\r\nworn away, surfeited with dinners, receptions, dances, and\r\nbridge-parties, she grew deadly tired of the social treadmill. It ceased\r\nto amuse her. She felt there was something wanting to complete her\r\nhappiness. She lost her buoyancy of disposition, her high spirits\r\ndisappeared, even her beauty paled. She became depressed and melancholy.\r\nPeople whispered that she was going into a decline. There had been a\r\ncase of consumption in the family, they said. Her father, laughingly\r\ndeclaring that she was in love, asked for the name of the lucky man.\r\n\r\n\"Are you going to make the Prince happy at last, child?\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"No, dad,\" she replied seriously. \"It's nothing to do with that. Among\r\nall the men who've paid me attention there's not one I'd marry--now.\"\r\n\r\nWhat seemed to Grace a more correct diagnosis of her trouble was made by\r\nMrs. Wesley Stuart, her practical married friend:\r\n\r\n\"It's only your nerves, my dear--a natural reaction after the pace\r\nyou've been going. What you need is a radical change of scene, something\r\nto stimulate your imagination. Take a trip around the world. If you'll\r\ngo, I'll go with you.\"\r\n\r\nWesley Stuart was one of the big men in the Steel Trust and several\r\ntimes a millionaire. Gossip had long hinted that there was no love lost\r\nbetween him and his young wife, and she never denied it. He went his\r\nway; she went hers. She had all the money her expensive tastes called\r\nfor, and this, coupled with a certain amount of natural cleverness, had\r\ngiven her considerable prominence in the artistic set. Her _musicales_\r\nwere a success because her ready tact and intimate acquaintance with\r\nfamous artists enabled her to surround herself with interesting people.\r\nHaving some musical talent herself, she nourished the hopeless ambition\r\nthat one day she would be able to sing in opera. Injudicious friends had\r\nencouraged her in this fatuous belief, and she had worked so hard and\r\nspent so much time and money studying with expensive teachers, with the\r\nidea of going on the stage, that at last her health gave way. Threatened\r\nwith nervous breakdown, her physician had advised a long sea voyage, and\r\nthis was just the opportunity she had been looking for. Both would have\r\nthe other's company. If Grace would go, she wouldn't hesitate a second.\r\nAs for her husband, he would be glad to be rid of her. She said it as a\r\njest; in her heart she knew it was true. Not that she cared. Wesley gave\r\nher all the money she asked for and never interfered with her. According\r\nto her philosophy of life, theirs was as perfect a matrimonial\r\nunderstanding as she could wish for.\r\n\r\nThe idea of the trip at once appealed strongly to Grace.\r\nEnthusiastically she declared that she would like nothing better. It\r\nwould be so novel and exciting, quite unlike any experience she had yet\r\nhad. Some friends who had already made the trip gave glowing accounts of\r\ntheir travels, and the more she thought of it the more decided she was\r\nthat around the world she would go. This decided it, for when once Grace\r\nmade up her mind, everything was as good as settled. Nothing her father\r\nor mother might say could deter her from the project. She pleaded that\r\nthe trip was absolutely necessary, not only for her health, but as a\r\nfinishing touch to her education. The ship was not only going to China,\r\nJapan, India, and Egypt. It would visit also many out-of-the-way islands\r\nwhich are practically inaccessible to the usual tourist and seldom if\r\never visited. As a lesson in geography alone it was worth the money.\r\nHarmon _pere_ did not mind the expense. The few thousands the trip would\r\ncost was a bagatelle to the man of millions. What he balked at was the\r\nidea of losing his cherished daughter for six long months. The\r\nuncertainties of Wall Street made it impossible for him to accompany\r\nher, and Mrs. Harmon suffered so horribly from seasickness that she\r\nthrew up her hands at the very suggestion. Seizing the excuse that a\r\nyoung girl could not go unaccompanied, her father, for the first time in\r\nhis recollection, asserted his authority, emphatically refused consent,\r\nand was obdurate to all coaxing. Then Grace played her trump card. Their\r\nfriend Mrs. Stuart was going on the same steamer. With a married woman\r\nfor a chaperon, what further objection could there be? Seeing that he\r\nwas check-mated, and that his daughter, as usual, would have her way in\r\nthe end anyhow, Mr. Harmon reluctantly capitulated.\r\n\r\nHe was down at the steamer to see her off, a tall,\r\ndistinguished-looking, silvery-haired old gentleman, conspicuous in the\r\ngroup of friends who had come to bid his daughter _bon voyage_. It was a\r\nnoisy, jolly, unruly crowd. Every one talked at the same time, pushing\r\nand elbowing, blocking the gangway up which rushed each minute fresh\r\narrivals laden with rugs and handbags. Ten minutes more and the \"All\r\nashore\" gong would sound, and then the big ship would slowly pull out\r\nand point her nose for the open sea. Grace stood in the center of the\r\nfashionably dressed throng, herself stylishly attired in a chic, long\r\ngray cloth directoire coat and picture hat, bestowing smiles and\r\nhandshakes right and left like a queen holding court. Everybody was in\r\nhigh spirits, all except Mr. Harmon, who tried to look brave as he\r\nfurtively wiped away a tear.\r\n\r\n\"Don't do that, dad, or I'll spoil my complexion,\" whispered Grace,\r\nmaking heroic efforts to swallow a hard lump that arose in her own\r\nthroat. \"One would think I were going away forever. I'll be back safe\r\nand sound before you imagine--you'll see!\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope so, child, I hope so,\" murmured the old man, clasping her to his\r\nbreast. \"It's foolish of me, of course. All the same, I can't help\r\nwishing you weren't going. I have a sort of presentiment that something\r\nwill happen.\"\r\n\r\nGrace laughed merrily.\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense, dad! What can happen? Nothing ever happens on ocean voyages.\r\nThey are awfully tame and exasperatingly free from incident. Shipwrecks\r\nand things like that occur only in novels. Sometimes I wish things would\r\nhappen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Really, Grace!\" protested a feminine voice at her side, \"I do wish you\r\nwouldn't say such wicked things. You know how nervous I am.\"\r\n\r\nThe speaker was Mrs. Wesley Stuart, under whose protective wing Grace\r\nwas traveling. She was a willowy and rather attractive blonde, not yet\r\nin the thirties, but with a complexion somewhat the worse for rich\r\nfoods, old wines, and late hours. Showily dressed, with a large black\r\nfelt mushroom hat and heavy pearl pendants in her ears, she talked with\r\naffected languor and used a gold lorgnon.\r\n\r\n\"Your father is quite right, dear,\" she went on. \"There are all sorts of\r\nperils at sea. A hundred things might happen. Our machinery might break\r\ndown, we might drift for weeks without being sighted, we might collide\r\nwith an iceberg in the fog, we might even turn turtle. Don't you\r\nremember that awful affair of the _City of Berlin_? Of course you don't.\r\nIt was before your time--before mine, too, for that matter. The steamer\r\nleft Liverpool about thirty years ago, crowded with passengers. She\r\nnever reached port, and has never been heard of from that day to this.\r\nEvery vestige of her was wiped out. They never picked up a life-boat,\r\nor even so much as a steamer-chair. The theory was that she turned\r\nturtle and went right down.\"\r\n\r\n\"No--really--you don't say so!\" exclaimed behind them a man's voice with\r\nthe exaggerated Piccadilly intonation some Englishmen affect. \"It's a\r\njolly shame, don'tcher know--to frighten Miss Harmon like that. She'll\r\nbelieve every bally thing you tell her and get the blue spiders and all\r\nthat sort of thing--eh, what?\"\r\n\r\nGrace turned, smiling, to greet the Honorable Percy Fitzhugh, who was\r\nhemmed in the crowd at their elbows. He had just come aboard with a\r\ngreen Tyrolian hat on the side of his head, a monocle in his eye, and a\r\nbull-terrier tucked under his arm. Close behind was his valet, carrying\r\na wonderful collection of walking-sticks and a huge bouquet of flowers.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I don't mind!\" laughed Grace. \"I'm a fine sailor and not a bit\r\nnervous. The sea has no terrors for me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish I could say as much,\" sighed Mrs. Stuart. Petulantly she added:\r\n\"I never feel safe on the ocean. I don't mind storms, but I'm terribly\r\nafraid of fog and icebergs and fire. Whenever it's foggy I can't eat or\r\nsleep. I'm in a state of mental anguish until it clears again.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a jolly good thing some of us have nerve--eh, what?\" exclaimed Mr.\r\nFitzhugh, with a wink at Grace. Addressing Mrs. Stuart, he went on: \"You\r\nremind me of Rex, my terrier here. He loathes the sea--howls and whines\r\ndismally the whole time. But please don't get the blue spiders, that's a\r\ngood girl. We're going to be an awfully jolly party. Don't spoil the\r\nfun. Try a champagne cocktail. Best antidote for nervousness in the\r\nworld. If one don't work, take two. You'll feel bully.\" Turning to his\r\nman, he added: \"Thompson, take those flowers to my stateroom, and go and\r\nsee about my 'tub' and steamer-chair.\"\r\n\r\nThe next moment the Englishman and his green thatch were swallowed up in\r\nthe crush of new arrivals.\r\n\r\n\"Did you ever see such a coarse, selfish creature!\" exclaimed Mrs.\r\nStuart indignantly. \"The impudence of his comparing me to his miserable\r\ndog!\"\r\n\r\n\"Who are the flowers for?\" laughed Grace.\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Phelps, of course. He's head over heels in debt. He needs her\r\nmoney. I wouldn't be surprised if he didn't catch on. She's very\r\nambitious--the title attracts her. There she comes now.\"\r\n\r\nA stylish, handsome woman, richly dressed all in black, with large\r\nGainsborough hat to match, came leisurely up the gangplank, followed by\r\na smart footman weighed down with packages. She nodded cordially to\r\nGrace and Mrs. Stuart as she caught sight of them, and disappeared in\r\nthe direction of the staterooms.\r\n\r\n\"She's literally bursting with money,\" whispered Mrs. Stuart, who knew\r\neverybody's business. \"Her husband left her ten millions. He was a\r\nsimple soul--a plain, matter-of-fact business man. All he thought of was\r\nmaking money. She never cared for him. It's just as well he died. She\r\ncan marry again now and live the life she likes best. All the men are\r\nafter her. Some think Count von Hatzfeld has the best chance. Of course\r\nyou know he's on the ship. You see, it's all cut and dried.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't blame her,\" said Grace cynically, as she returned the bow of\r\nanother arrival. \"It must be dreadful to be a mere 'Mrs. Green' or 'Mrs.\r\nBrown.' I couldn't live with any ordinary man--a mere business man whose\r\none thought was figures and profits. My ideal is an English peer or an\r\nItalian count--preferably the latter. They are less expensive. English\r\ndukes, they say, drink hard and beat their wives. It would be nice to be\r\naddressed as 'Duchess,' or 'Comtesse.'\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Stuart looked approvingly at her _protegee_.\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad to see you're so practical, my dear.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not? This is a practical age,\" laughed Grace.\r\n\r\n\"Well, there's Prince Sergius. He's only waiting the word. Why don't you\r\nmarry him and be a princess--only two lives removed from a throne? Every\r\nwoman in America would envy you.\"\r\n\r\nGrace frowned.\r\n\r\n\"And I--would despise myself?\" she answered. \"Every one knows his\r\nreputation. It's my money he wants, that's all. I haven't yet sunk so\r\nlow as to purchase a titled husband at the price of my self-respect.\r\nBesides, I could not endure a tie that would be entirely loveless,\r\nwholly mercenary. I hope I have some ideals; some sentiment left.\"\r\n\r\n\"Were you ever in love?\" persisted her companion.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose I was, like most girls. When I first left school I saw boys I\r\nliked. All girls are silly at some period of their life. But I survived\r\nthose early attachments. I am still heart-whole. I never see nowadays a\r\nman with whom I could fall in love. To me, they all seem conceited and\r\nselfish. Of course I shall have to marry one day or other, but I'm\r\nafraid it will be what the French call a _mariage de convenance_.\r\n\r\n\"Or, in plain Yankee, marriage with an eye to the main chance,\" rejoined\r\nMrs. Stuart. \"But you don't have to marry for money, child. You are\r\nrich.\"\r\n\r\nGrace was thoughtful a moment, and then she replied:\r\n\r\n\"Money is not everything--mere money is vulgar. One gets horribly tired\r\nof it.\" Pensively she went on: \"You think I am cold and devoid of\r\nsentiment. You are wrong. I yearn for life in the sun-lit countries of\r\nthe old world, in historic lands of intrigue, love, and passion, with\r\nbrilliant state functions amid scenes of regal splendor, where class\r\nand birth count for more than mere wealth. In America we have only the\r\nmoney standard. The wife of any little grocer who gets rich overnight\r\nmay be a social leader to-morrow. It's disgusting!\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Stuart was about to say something when a sudden commotion on the\r\ndock attracted everybody's attention, and there was a general rush to\r\nthe rail. A large crowd had gathered near the entrance of the gangway,\r\nsurrounding a man who lay struggling on the ground. Policemen and ship's\r\nofficers were stooping over him trying to quiet him.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter?\" cried Grace anxiously. \"I hope no one's hurt!\"\r\n\r\n\"It looks as if some one had fallen in a fit,\" said Mrs. Stuart, looking\r\nthrough her lorgnon.\r\n\r\nMr. Harmon, who had been conversing with an acquaintance, came up\r\nhurriedly. Having noticed the excitement, he feared that some harm\r\nthreatened his daughter.\r\n\r\n\"It's an accident of some kind,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I knew something would happen!\" exclaimed Mrs. Stuart, getting out\r\nher smelling-salts.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know what the matter is?\" inquired Grace of a sailor.\r\n\r\nThe man grinned and touched his cap.\r\n\r\n\"'Tain't nothin', miss. Only one of 'em blokes what keeps the fire's\r\na-goin' got it inter ees 'ead that it was too bloomin' 'ot for 'im. So\r\n'ee jumps the blessed ship without so much as askin' leave, an' gets run\r\nin by the cops fer 'is pains.\"\r\n\r\nThe explanation, such as it was, was wholly incomprehensible to Grace,\r\nwho knew as much as she did before. Meantime the crowd grew bigger, the\r\nnoise louder and the excitement more intense. A number of ship's\r\nofficers had the man on his feet and were half dragging him, half\r\ncarrying him to the gangplank. It was not exactly an agreeable spectacle\r\nwith which to regale fastidious passengers on sailing-day, and the\r\nship's officers would have gladly avoided it. But the refractory stoker\r\nwas necessary to the speed of the vessel, and there was no way of\r\ngetting him aboard except by the main gangway. It was late. The steamer\r\nwould pull out any moment, and the other gangways had been already\r\npulled in.\r\n\r\nMrs. Stuart offered to interpret the sailor's speech:\r\n\r\n\"He says that one of the sailors has been overcome by the heat and\r\nfallen on the dock in a faint.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not exactly, miss,\" grinned the man, with another tug of his cap.\r\n\"'Ee's not the kind wot faints. 'Ee's puttin' up a fight. 'Ee's a\r\nfighter, is Handsome Jack.\"\r\n\r\nGrace turned in bewilderment to her father, who had just returned on\r\nboard.\r\n\r\n\"Handsome Jack!\" she echoed. \"What does he mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's only a deserter,\" explained Mr. Harmon. \"A fireman who attempted\r\nto get away before the ship sailed. The officers found him in a\r\ndrinking-shop and brought him here.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't blame the poor beggar for trying to desert,\" said the Honorable\r\nPercy Fitzhugh, who had just come up from below-stairs. \"It's jolly\r\nawful in that stoke-hold, don'tcher know? Ever been down in the\r\nstoke-hold, Miss Harmon? No? I'll take you down some day--eh, what? I\r\ndon't see how they get men to do such work. I'd rather commit suicide,\r\nby Jove!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it is terrible work,\" said Mr. Harmon. \"They take to it only when\r\ndesperate and forced by circumstances. It is well known that murderers\r\nand criminals of every description take to stoking when they wish to lie\r\nlow. They know the police will never look for them in the stoke-hold, on\r\nthe theory that they are getting punishment enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"How dreadful!\" yawned Grace, as she watched with languid interest the\r\ncommotion on the shore. Presently she asked: \"Can they make him go back\r\nto work in the stoke-hold whether he likes or not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" replied her father. \"This is an English ship. He probably\r\nsigned articles in Liverpool. Under British maritime law, any member of\r\nthe crew deserting ship in a foreign port can be arrested. That's what,\r\nin sailor parlance, is called 'a pier-head jump.' You see, a big vessel\r\nlike this must have its full complement of stokers, otherwise she can't\r\nget up enough steam, and the record suffers. That's why they take the\r\ntrouble to go after deserters. They say that this fellow deserves no\r\nsympathy. He's a good-for-nothing, brutal, violent fellow. Here he\r\ncomes now.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd like to see him!\" exclaimed Grace, pushing forward to get a closer\r\nview of the group of men as they came struggling up the gangplank.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Grace, how can you look at such horrid sights?\" ejaculated Mrs.\r\nStuart, fanning herself nervously and averting her face.\r\n\r\nThe prisoner by this time was nearly exhausted, and presented a sorry\r\nsight. His grease-stained clothes were torn to rags, his hair was\r\ndisheveled, blood flowed freely from a cut on his cheek, making all the\r\nmore striking the contrast with his white, set face and its grim,\r\nhopeless expression.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IT WAS ALL THEY COULD DO TO DRAG HIM ON BOARD.]\r\n\r\nArmitage knew he was beaten. His strength and determination had availed\r\nhim nothing, yet he was still full of fight. It was all they could do to\r\ndrag him on board inch by inch. As they reached the deck, and he\r\nrealized that once more the ship had enslaved him, a hoarse cry of\r\ndespair escaped his lips. With a last superhuman effort, he shook\r\nhimself free. One of his captors was hurled to the left, the other sent\r\nflying to the right. His fists shot out, and a third officer fell like\r\na log. For a moment he was free, and, surprised at his success, he stood\r\ntriumphant over their prostrate forms, just as a gladiator, doomed to\r\ndie, might tower for a few brief seconds above his worsted foes. His\r\nfists clenched, his shapely head thrown back, every muscle taut, his\r\neyes flashing, chest heaving, he resembled a classic hero battling with\r\npigmies.\r\n\r\n\"Isn't he handsome!\" exclaimed Grace.\r\n\r\n\"Aye, miss,\" grinned the voluble sailor. \"That's wot we call\r\n'im--Handsome Jack. Sometimes it's Gentleman Jack, cause of 'is fine\r\nmanners; but 'ee's only a stoker, just the same.\"\r\n\r\nThe officers regained their feet and again sprang at their prisoner. The\r\npassengers fell back alarmed.\r\n\r\n\"Come here, Grace!\" cried Mr. Harmon uneasily. \"You'll get hurt.\"\r\n\r\nBut there was no danger. More officers and sailors ran quickly up, and\r\nconfronted by such re-enforcements, the fireman stood no chance. Before\r\nhe had time to take advantage of his temporary victory, he was again\r\noverpowered and dragged without further ado in the direction of the\r\nforecastle. Grace shrank back as he was taken past, but she could not\r\nhelp seeing his wild, staring eyes and white face with its expression of\r\ndespair. As he disappeared, the last gong sounded, every visitor hurried\r\nashore, the siren started its deep-toned blasts as warning that the\r\nleviathan was getting under weigh.\r\n\r\n\"I wish it hadn't happened,\" said Grace, as she kissed her hand in adieu\r\nto her father, who stood on the dock watching the vessel go out.\r\n\r\n\"It's made me positively ill,\" complained Mrs. Stuart, busy with her\r\nsmelling-salts.\r\n\r\nLong after New York's sky-scrapers had faded from view and the land was\r\nonly a dim line on the horizon, Grace was still haunted by that white,\r\nset face, with its expression of utter despair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Indian Ocean, a vast expanse of tossing blue water, its heaving\r\nbosom still agitated by the expiring gale, glorious in the outburst of\r\nsunshine that followed the storm, stretched away to every point of the\r\ncompass. As far as the eye could carry, away to where the breaking\r\nclouds touched the fast-disappearing land line of mysterious Asia, the\r\nboisterous white-capped seas scattered showers of prisms and spray.\r\nRolling and tumbling, their lofty crests flecked with fleecy foam, the\r\nendless waves advanced majestically, with rhythmical motion and the\r\nstateliness and precision of trained battalions, all scurrying in one\r\ndirection, urged on by the whip of the southwesterly gale. The tempest\r\nhad abated, the lowering clouds were rapidly dispersing, once more\r\nNature was smiling and serene, diffusing the beauty and gladness of life\r\nthrough water and sky. Graceful, white-winged sea-birds uttered shrill\r\ncries of delight as they circled in the air, gorgeously colored flying\r\nfish leaped joyously from the dancing waters, which flashed like jewels\r\nin the blinding sunlight. The world was at its brightest and fairest,\r\nfull of movement and color. The breeze was caressing and balmy, and as\r\nthe _Atlanta_, now three weeks from home, plunged her way resistlessly\r\nEastward, the great liner was sonorous with the music of wind and sea.\r\n\r\nThus far the voyage had hardly been all that could be desired as regards\r\nweather. January is seldom a good month for the Atlantic, and this year\r\nthe crossing was nastier than usual. The _Atlanta_ had no sooner cleared\r\nthe Banks than it began to blow great guns. Gale followed gale with\r\ntropical downpours of rain, the wind blowing from every quarter at once,\r\npiling up mountainous combers that every now and again broke over the\r\nbridge, forty feet above the water. The tremendous seas crashed aboard\r\nwith a thunderous roar, frightening the more timid among the passengers,\r\nsmashing life-boats and ventilators, sweeping the decks from bow to stem\r\nwith avalanches of green water. Skylights were shattered, bridge\r\nstanchions bent and twisted, but otherwise there was no damage. The big\r\nship steamed true on her course, haughtily indifferent to the\r\ncapricious ocean's moods, staunch as a rock, and quite as steady as any\r\nrailroad-train moving at full speed.\r\n\r\nThe rough weather had the natural effect of confining most of the women\r\nfolk to their staterooms, and as the men also kept to themselves,\r\npreferring bridge and poker in the smoking-room to the wet decks, there\r\nwas not much opportunity for social amenities.\r\n\r\nOwing to the high seas, no attempt was made to land at Madeira, and\r\nthere was no little grumbling because the vagaries of the elements made\r\nit impossible to visit Funchal, the Pico Ruivo, Ponta Delgada, and other\r\npicturesque places of perennial verdure and flowers. The storm gradually\r\nabated, but it was not until the steamer entered the smoother waters of\r\nthe Mediterranean that there was the slightest pretense at dress or any\r\nattempt made to put in regular appearances at dinner. However, the\r\nimprovement in the weather and the close proximity of land, with the\r\ncheering prospect of going ashore, brought about a quick change in\r\neverybody's humor. The passengers' spirits rose with the barometer.\r\nFine toilettes made their appearance on deck, the usual little\r\nsteamer-chair cliques were speedily formed, and every one now started in\r\nto enjoy themselves as if the voyage had only just begun.\r\n\r\nThey landed gleefully in tenders, some to inspect the wonders of\r\nEngland's impregnable fortress, others to visit Spanishtown; they\r\ncrowded to the rail as the ship steamed slowly past the enchanted island\r\nof Capri, so dear to the archeologist, and in the Bay of Naples they\r\ngazed in awe upon frowning Vesuvius, still smoking and rumbling after a\r\ndisastrous eruption that had cost hundreds of lives. Sheep-like, after\r\nthe manner of tourists, they hurried breathlessly through the\r\nattractions Naples had to offer, and then, skirting classic Scylla and\r\nCharybdis, they steamed on to the land of the Pharaohs, where a complete\r\nchange of scene awaited them.\r\n\r\nSo far, Grace had kept much to herself. She was not particularly\r\ninterested in anybody on board, and she found it a welcome novelty,\r\nafter her recent strenuous social activities, to be able to enjoy a few\r\nhours of absolute rest. What with unpacking, writing letters home, and\r\nlooking after Mrs. Stuart, who, almost from the start, had been\r\ncompletely prostrated with seasickness, she had found the time slip by\r\nrapidly and agreeably enough without having to seek diversion outside\r\nher immediate little circle. Her chaperon's indisposition furnished her\r\nwith an admirable excuse for remaining in seclusion, and if another were\r\nneeded, she had it in the inclemency of the weather. While she herself\r\nwas not distressed by the rolling and pitching, the unusual motion did\r\nnot add to her comfort. She preferred to stay in the privacy of her\r\nluxurious quarters, which were the object of the envy and curiosity of\r\nevery other woman on board.\r\n\r\nMr. Harmon had spared no expense to secure for his daughter the best on\r\nthe ship that money could buy. Grace occupied the \"royal\" suite, a\r\nseries of sumptuously furnished and richly decorated rooms, entirely\r\nshut off from the rest of the ship, thus ensuring complete privacy,\r\ncomprising bedroom, parlor, dining-room, with piano, telephone, library,\r\netc. With her own maids to wait on her and all meals served privately,\r\nthere was no necessity to leave her rooms unless she wished to, and if\r\nshe chose to breathe the invigorating sea air there was no one to see\r\nher walk on the deserted lower promenade-deck on which her suite\r\ndirectly opened.\r\n\r\nShe had not gone ashore with the other passengers when the steamer\r\nstopped at Gibraltar and Naples. Mrs. Stuart was still indisposed, and\r\nshe refused to leave her, but when the _Atlanta_ reached Cairo, her\r\nchaperon was feeling better, and they both landed to see the sights.\r\nMrs. Stuart had visited Egypt before, but to Grace it was like a glimpse\r\nof grand-opera land, a scene from \"Aida.\" The waving palm-trees, the\r\nqueer Oriental dwellings, the wonderful blue sky blazing on the peaceful\r\ndesert, with its endless miles of burning sands, its beautiful oases,\r\nits camels and picturesquely costumed natives--all this made up a\r\npicture of delightful novelty for the young girl fresh from prosaic New\r\nYork. She gazed wondering at the blue-turbaned Copts, they laughed\r\nmerrily at the Fellahin in their blue skirts and stared at the\r\nyellow-turbaned Jews, fierce-looking Bedouins and black Nubians. At the\r\ncost of a few piastres but much muscular exertion, they were dragged up\r\nthe face of the mighty pyramids, and with varying emotions they\r\ncontemplated the time-eaten features of the inscrutable Sphinx.\r\n\r\nThe two women derived much enjoyment from their little jaunts. Sometimes\r\nthey were escorted by Mr. Fitzhugh, who, despairing of making any\r\nheadway with Mrs. Phelps now that his detested German rival, Count von\r\nHatzfeld, had contrived to monopolize the widow, had begun to dance\r\nattendance upon Grace. He knew she had money in her own right, and his\r\nmouth watered at the magnitude of her expectations. There seemed no\r\nreason why the Harmon millions should not be as usefully employed in\r\nregilding the dilapidated Fitzhugh coat-of-arms as those of the late Mr.\r\nPhelps. But he did not make much progress, and he had a vague\r\npremonition that he was not the kind of chap to appeal to this cold,\r\nproud beauty. Discreet conversations on the subject with Mrs. Stuart\r\nwent far to discourage him altogether.\r\n\r\n\"Grace does not expect to love the man she will marry, so her utter\r\nindifference does not reflect her feelings to you in the least,\" said\r\nthat perspicacious student of modern femininity. This statement was not\r\nexactly true, but it served the purpose of the moment. \"Even if she\r\nconsidered you a desirable match,\" she went on, \"she would not be any\r\nmore unbending. That indifferent, independent manner is her chief charm.\r\nIt is the stateliness of the lily. Grace might marry you, but she would\r\nnot love you. She is too much up to date to believe there is any such\r\nthing as love. Self-interest governs the world to-day--not love, which,\r\nafter all, is only a primitive, vulgar emotion. Girls who want to marry\r\nwell understand this thoroughly. Love and lovers are very delightful in\r\nfiction, but no sensible girl to-day takes them into account when\r\nplanning her future welfare. When Grace does change her name, it will be\r\nto take that of one of the proudest families in Europe. Surely you know\r\nthat she's already as good as engaged to Prince Sergius of Eurasia! As\r\nfar as titles are concerned, that's going some!\"\r\n\r\n\"But I may be a peer one day,\" protested Mr. Fitzhugh.\r\n\r\n\"You may be, but you're not,\" retorted Mrs. Stuart. \"Your father, the\r\nearl, is still alive, and your elder brother is aggressively healthy.\r\nAmerican girls do not deal in futures.\"\r\n\r\nThe Englishman took the hint, and, profiting by a temporary\r\nindisposition of Count von Hatzfeld, returned to the siege of the\r\nfascinating Mrs. Phelps, whose millions were nearly as many and\r\naspirations not quite as high as those of Miss Grace Harmon.\r\n\r\nThe steamer stayed in port over a week, much to the delight of the\r\npassengers, who enjoyed the holiday ashore hugely after having been\r\ncooped up so long aboard. The weather continued ideal, and every one\r\ntook advantage of it to see everything that was worth seeing.\r\n\r\nThe more enterprising passengers undertook little side excursions up the\r\nhistoric Nile; others roamed through the native bazaars, buying at\r\nexorbitant prices a vast quantity of things for which they had no\r\npossible use; others drove to the tomb of Mehemet Ali, or to the\r\nviceroys' palace, keeping up the sightseeing day and night, until all\r\nwere so weary that they were glad when the _Atlanta_ once more weighed\r\nanchor and proceeded down the Red Sea and so into the Indian Ocean, _en\r\nroute_, for Bombay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs she sat on the deck, reclining indolently in her steamer-chair,\r\npropped up with soft cushions, gazing dreamily on the splendid panorama\r\nthat unfolded slowly before her--the endless procession of majestic,\r\nfoam-tipped waves, fleecy clouds drifting lazily in a sky of turquoise\r\nblue, the sails of a distant vessel whitened by the sun--Grace felt\r\nexuberant with the joy of life.\r\n\r\nThe latest novel was on her lap, yet she made no attempt to read. Mrs.\r\nStuart, stretched out on a chair alongside, had vainly endeavored to\r\nengage her in conversation. But she did not care to talk, and she found\r\nit impossible to center her attention on a book, preferring to just lay\r\nstill, her eyes semi-closed, rocked gently by the steamer's gradual\r\nmotion, her senses gently thrilled by the sensuous sounds of ship and\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nThe promenade-deck presented the picture of comfort and peace usually to\r\nbe seen, any fine morning on a liner in mid-ocean--the passengers of\r\nboth sexes laid out in rows, mummylike, on steamer-chairs, each covered\r\nwith a rug different from his neighbor's and of bizarre design and\r\ncolor, some reading, some sleeping, some conversing in subdued tones,\r\nsome sipping cups of bouillon brought on trays by nimble stewards; the\r\ndecks scrubbed an immaculate white, the brasses highly polished; a\r\nneatly uniformed quartermaster standing at a gangway, patiently splicing\r\na rope; two officers on the bridge sweeping the horizon with their\r\nglasses or pacing up and down with monotonous precision. With no noises\r\nto irritate the ear, a sea voyage has no equal as a rest cure. One heard\r\nnothing but the purring of the wind, the gentle flapping of canvas, the\r\nsplash of the waves, the regular throb of the ship's propeller.\r\nConditions were ideal for day-dreams, and Grace was thinking.\r\n\r\nAs she idly watched the foaming water rush past the rail she thought how\r\npleasantly fate had planned her life. She might have been born poor and\r\ncompelled to work in a store for miserable wages, standing on her feet\r\nbehind a counter ten long and weary hours a day, forbidden to sit down\r\non pain of dismissal, bullied by arrogant employers, insulted by\r\ninconsiderate customers. This she knew was the lot of thousands of girls\r\nwhose pale, tired faces had frequently aroused her sympathy when\r\nshopping. She belonged to the small, lucky minority--the ruling\r\nclass--which by the power of its great wealth is able to enslave\r\nnine-tenths of the human race. The world, she ruminated, was full of\r\nunfortunates whose only fault was that they were born poor. Her mind\r\nreverted to the handsome stoker whom they had dragged on board with such\r\nlittle ceremony the day the ship sailed from New York. She wondered what\r\nhis life had been to force him to take to such an occupation, and what\r\nhad become of him. Perhaps at that very moment, while she sat there\r\nsurrounded by every luxury, he was suffering the agonies of the damned.\r\nShe reproached herself for not making inquiries after him. When she next\r\nsaw the captain she would certainly do so.\r\n\r\nHow different was her own life! Sailing along on this splendid ship,\r\nwith perfect weather and ideal surroundings, the world seemed to exist\r\nonly to afford her pleasure. If the sun shone brightly, it was only to\r\ngive her joy; if the soft winds blew, it was only to caress her cheek.\r\nIt seemed unjust. Things were not equal. At times she was sorry that her\r\nfather was so rich. Had he been poor, she would have had an incentive to\r\nwork hard and do something. Although she had everything she desired, she\r\nwas not really happy. She felt there was something wanting, and she\r\nthought it was because her life lacked a definite aim. Other girls did\r\nthings--they painted pictures, wrote books, went on the stage. If her\r\nfather became bankrupt to-morrow, where would she be? A perfectly\r\nuseless member of society, ornamental, possibly, but quite useless. Only\r\ntwo alternatives would be open to her--either to seek some humble\r\nemployment or throw herself in the arms of a rich man. She would not be\r\nthe first victim of the plutocracy which closes the doors of the liberal\r\nprofessions to its daughters, only to throw them, in the hour of\r\nadversity, into the palsied arms of the roue and the voluptuary.\r\n\r\nLike most American girls, Grace had little to learn in regard to life's\r\nfundamentals. She had read all the decadent novelists, from D'Aununzio\r\nto Eleanor Glyn, and the daily newspapers, coupled with whispered\r\nconversations over five-o'clock teas, had speedily shattered what other\r\nillusions had been left over from her school-days. The low moral\r\nstandard of the set in which she moved had made her cynical in her\r\nattitude toward the men who courted her. She had a horror of\r\nfortune-hunters, and most of the men who had paid her attention, Prince\r\nSergius and the rest, she suspected of being after her money. Yet she\r\nmust marry some day. She must find a husband, even if she were not to\r\nlove him. A married woman is able to take a place in society that is\r\ndenied the single woman. Marry she must, but whom? The men she knew\r\neither bored her or disgusted her. He need not be a rich man, for she\r\nhad enough for both, yet if a poor man presented himself, she would\r\ncertainly put him in the fortune-hunting class. As she had told her\r\nfriend, Mrs. Stuart, a man with a proud title would suit her best. There\r\nwould be no question of love, of course, only self-interest on both\r\nsides. He would furnish the coronet, she the dollars. It would be the\r\n_mariage de convenance_, with its hypocrisies, its lies, its miseries.\r\n\r\nShe wondered if her attitude toward life were wrong, if really there\r\nwere not a man somewhere whom a woman could respect and admire for his\r\nstrength, his bravery, his nobility of character. The old-fashioned\r\nauthors--the Dumas, the Scotts, the Bulwer Lyttons, the\r\nElliots--presented such men as their heroes. Were there no such men left\r\nin the world to-day? Or were the writers of modern fiction right when\r\nthey depicted the men of to-day as fortune-hunters, egotistical\r\ncoxcombs, conscienceless libertines, deliberate destroyers of women's\r\nvirtue? Cynical as the reading of unwholesome books and witnessing\r\nsalacious plays had made her, Grace had still a little of the romantic\r\nleft in her. She was still healthy-minded enough to find romance more\r\nsatisfying than the vulgar realism of the modern risque novel. And as\r\nshe lay there in her chair, basking in the warm sunshine, her eyes half\r\nclosed, she abandoned herself momentarily to the sensuousness of the\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\nIn her imagination gradually took form the ideal hero her heart craved\r\nfor. She was resting on a country road, and a man was approaching. He\r\nwas tall, with dark, wavy hair and smooth face, and the clean-cut\r\nfeatures of a Greek god. He knew she was rich, but he cared not, for he\r\ndespised mere wealth, and he was about to pass by unheeding, when he\r\nchanced to notice her face, which pleased his sense of beauty. He\r\nstopped wondering, and, chatting with her, marveled at the liquid\r\nsplendor of her eyes. This was the woman he had sought, the woman for\r\nwhom he would toil and fight. He took her hand, and at his touch her\r\nheart leaped ecstatically. A strange thrill stirred her as he gazed\r\nhungrily into her eyes and gently drew her to him. Timidly she yielded\r\nto his ardent embrace, and as he clasped her soft form roughly to his\r\nstrong breast and his warm lips met hers in a deep, lingering kiss that\r\nseemed to aspire her very soul, a sensation she had never known before\r\ninvaded her entire being. She felt as though she would swoon.\r\n\r\n\"Aren't you getting hungry, Grace? Whatever are you so engrossed about?\"\r\nsaid Mrs. Stuart petulantly.\r\n\r\nThe interruption was so sudden and abrupt that Grace was startled, and\r\nit was with some confusion that she replied:\r\n\r\n\"Just thinking--that's all! This weather actually makes one foolish.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good morning, ladies!\"\r\n\r\nA shadow suddenly shut out the glare of the sun. Grace and Mrs. Stuart\r\nlooked up. It was Captain Summers, who was walking the deck with\r\nProfessor Hanson. The _Atlanta_'s commander was a typical sea-dog, big,\r\nbroad-shouldered, with a deep bass voice and a face tanned by exposure\r\nto all sorts of weather. Contrasted with Professor Hanson, a nervous\r\nlittle man, with a bald, domelike cranium, he looked like a giant. Like\r\nmost Englishmen, he was frigid in manner and not too amiable in his\r\nintercourse with the passengers. But Grace, Mrs. Stuart, and the\r\nprofessor happened to sit at his table, which made a difference. For\r\nthem he condescended to unbend. He was not blind to the fact that Grace\r\nwas an uncommonly good-looking girl, and Mrs. Stuart amused him.\r\nTouching his cap, he sank into the empty seat on the other side of\r\nGrace, while Professor Hanson drew up another chair.\r\n\r\n\"How long can we expect this glorious weather to last, captain?\" asked\r\nMrs. Stuart, greeting the commander's salute with a gracious smile.\r\n\r\n\"It's hard to say,\" he replied pleasantly, after a quick glance at the\r\nsky. \"The barometer's steady enough now, but in these latitudes one may\r\nexpect anything at any time. The Indian Ocean is as capricious in its\r\nmoods as a woman. I've seen it as quiet as this at noon, yet by\r\nnightfall we'd run into such a storm that you'd think the ship would be\r\nblown out of the water.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, dear!\" exclaimed Mrs. Stuart, with a little nervous laugh. \"I hope\r\nwe shan't have any such experience. I'd die of fright.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't worry, m'm,\" replied the captain reassuringly. \"There's no sign\r\nof a change.\" Gallantly he added: \"I wouldn't hear of you ladies being\r\nput to the slightest inconvenience. I'll see that this weather continues\r\nuntil we arrive at Bombay.\"\r\n\r\n\"When do we get in, captain?\" demanded Grace languidly.\r\n\r\n\"You're not getting tired of us, I hope,\" replied the commander, with a\r\nlaugh.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no. I only want to know when I must begin to pack my trunks. You\r\nknow, we're going on a motor tour inland.\"\r\n\r\n\"Next Saturday we shall have the captain's dinner, with the dance\r\nafterward,\" interrupted Mrs. Stuart. \"So I suppose they expect to land\r\nus Monday.\"\r\n\r\n\"How about that, captain?\" demanded the professor.\r\n\r\nCaptain Summers looked at all three in an amused sort of way, and for a\r\nmoment made no answer. Then gruffly he said:\r\n\r\n\"A sailor of experience never ventures to make predictions. We are due\r\nat Bombay next Monday. If all goes well, I expect to land my passengers\r\non that day. As Mrs. Stuart says, we shall entertain you at dinner and\r\ngive you a dance on deck next Saturday, in honor of our arrival. But if\r\nanything delays us, don't be disappointed. We might run on a rock and go\r\nto the bottom. Or we might break our propellers. If that happened, we\r\nshould be completely helpless. We might drift out of our course for\r\nweeks before help could reach us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, wouldn't that be awful!\" cried Mrs. Stuart.\r\n\r\n\"How could we summon assistance?\" asked Grace eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"By wireless, of course,\" broke in the professor, who assumed the air of\r\nsuperior knowledge on every subject broached. \"The invention of wireless\r\ntelegraphy has practically reduced the perils of seagoing to a\r\nnegligible minimum.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank Heaven, we've got the wireless!\" gasped Mrs. Stuart. \"I could hug\r\nthe man who invented it--Macaroni--what's his name?\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean Marconi, my dear madam,\" interposed the professor solemnly.\r\n\r\n\"The wireless is all right as far as it goes,\" said the captain grimly.\r\n\"Certainly its invention is a great step forward, but two things are\r\nessential for its success in a critical situation. Firstly, it must be\r\nin working order. In bad weather the aerial wires are apt to be put out\r\nof commission. Secondly, there must be a Marconi station or receiver\r\nwithin a few hundred miles of where you happen to be. If these\r\nconditions are not present, you might as well whistle!\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Stuart looked so depressed at this discouraging opinion that Grace\r\ncould not repress a smile. Professor Hanson, never sorry of an\r\nopportunity to air his fund of information, went on pompously:\r\n\r\n\"Captain, you spoke just now of running on a rock. Is it not a fact that\r\nin this ocean there are rocks and small islands not shown on the\r\nnautical charts, and that for this reason navigation in these waters is\r\nmore dangerous than elsewhere?\"\r\n\r\nFor all reply, the commander gave vent to a loud guffaw and, with a side\r\nglance at Mrs. Stuart, winked slyly at Grace.\r\n\r\n\"If we keep up this kind of talk, Mrs. Stuart will think we're doomed to\r\ncome to grief of some kind. Let's be more cheerful.\"\r\n\r\n\"Am I right or wrong, captain?\" persisted the professor. \"My information\r\ncame from a naval man.\"\r\n\r\nThe commander's face became set and stern, as it usually did when he was\r\nserious. Removing his cigar, he said slowly:\r\n\r\n\"Your informant was right. For some reason or other, there is no such\r\nthing as an absolutely accurate chart of the Indian Ocean. They have\r\ntalked for years of making a new chart, but, so far, nothing has been\r\ndone. Yet we sailors who regularly navigate these waters know from\r\nexperience that there are hereabouts currents strong enough to divert a\r\nvessel from her true course, and a number of small islands no mention of\r\nwhich is made on the existing charts. The Admiralty and Lloyds are well\r\naware of the existence Of these dangers to navigation, but you all know\r\nwhat red tape is.\"\r\n\r\n\"How delightfully romantic!\" cried Grace, with enthusiasm. \"Unexplored\r\nislands inhabited by savages who never saw white people, and who trade\r\nin beads and go naked!\"\r\n\r\n\"Cannibals, no doubt,\" suggested Mrs. Stuart, with an affected shudder.\r\n\r\n\"Where are these islands?\" inquired Grace.\r\n\r\n\"A long way out of our course, I hope,\" laughed the captain. \"Yet I've\r\npassed quite close to some of them. They seem quite deserted. So far as\r\nwe could make out, there is not even animal life on them. But, being in\r\nthe direct steamer lane to India, they constitute a menace to shipping\r\nthat should be removed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Most decidedly--most decidedly!\" said the professor emphatically.\r\n\r\nCaptain Summers arose to go.\r\n\r\n\"It's very delightful chatting here,\" he said, with a smile; \"but I must\r\ngo up on the bridge and attend to my duties. Otherwise, we may bump\r\nright on to one of those islands.\"\r\n\r\n\"By the way, captain,\" said Grace. \"What has become of that poor fireman\r\nwho made such a disturbance the day we sailed from New York?\"\r\n\r\nThe captain frowned.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, he's down where he belongs--shoveling coal.\" Then he added: \"Don't\r\nwaste any sympathy on him. He's about as hard a character as you could\r\nfind. Stokers are all troublesome as a class, but this Armitage fellow\r\nis quite unmanageable. I shall be glad to get rid of him. We had to put\r\nhim on bread and water the first ten days out. It wasn't until he was\r\nnearly dead from starvation that he consented to go to work.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stoking down in that pit in that terrific heat must be fearful!\"\r\nexclaimed the professor.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" growled the captain. \"It is pretty bad. Most of them don't mind\r\nit, though. They aren't good for anything else. They're tough,\r\ncoarse-fibered creatures, scarcely superior in instincts to the savage.\r\nThey'd think nothing of running a knife into you, and that Armitage chap\r\nis worse than the worst of them. We've had trouble with him all along.\"\r\n\r\n\"Still, after all,\" mused the professor, \"we mustn't forget that it is\r\nthey who make the ship go. We couldn't do without them. Every man has\r\nhis place in the world's economy.\"\r\n\r\n\"It must be very interesting to see them at work,\" remarked Grace. \"I'd\r\nlike to see what the stoke-hold looks like. Mr. Fitzhugh said he would\r\ntake me down.\" Looking down the deck, she added: \"Here he comes now.\r\nI'll ask him.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's no time like the present,\" said the captain. \"See Mr.\r\nWetherbee, the chief engineer. He'll take you down.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said the professor pedantically. \"The spectacle will be a good\r\nobject lesson for you--a pampered daughter of the plutocracy. With a\r\nlittle imagination, you can see in the stoke-hold social conditions as\r\nthey actually are in the world to-day. In the stokers you have the\r\nlaborers, the mill-hands, the sweat-shop workers, the common people who\r\ntoil painfully for pitiful wages, for their daily bread. We others up\r\nhere, lolling in our luxurious steamer-chairs, living on the fat of the\r\nland--or, rather, sea, to be more correct--are the masters, the\r\ncapitalists. It is the slave system of ancient Rome under another name,\r\nthat's all. It's all wrong. Man's injustice to man is the great crime of\r\nthe centuries. Why should I be here enjoying every comfort and those\r\nunfortunate men down there condemned to tortures as cruel as those\r\ndevised by the merciless Inquisition.\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Summers shrugged his massive shoulders, and, as he turned to go,\r\nsaid laughingly:\r\n\r\n\"Mind you don't talk that way in the stoke-hold, or they might take you\r\nat your word and keep you down there.\"\r\n\r\n\"No danger of that, captain,\" laughed Mrs. Stuart. \"The professor's\r\nonly theorizing, you know. It costs nothing to expound theory. He has no\r\nidea of exchanging places with the stokers.\"\r\n\r\nThe commander guffawed loudly, and, with a parting salute to the ladies,\r\nturned on his heel and disappeared up the companionway. At that moment\r\nthe Hon. Percy Fitzhugh came up, the inevitable monocle in his eye.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I say, Miss Harmon,\" he began, with his affected English drawl. \"Be\r\nmy partner at shuffleboard, eh, what?\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Stuart, irritated at an invitation which ignored her, answered for\r\nher ward:\r\n\r\n\"Miss Harmon has more serious things to attend to. Don't come disturbing\r\nus with your idiotic games. We are intellectual here--talking socialism,\r\ncannibals, wireless, stoke-holds, and such things. If you can't be\r\nintellectual, keep away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Fitzhugh,\" said Grace, laughing, \"you promised to take me down to\r\nthe stoke-hold. Suppose we all go now?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Fitzhugh beamed. The beautiful one had actually deigned to ask him\r\na favor. Overcome with emotion, he stuttered his reply:\r\n\r\n\"Delighted, of course. It'll be jolly good sport to see the beggars hard\r\nat work down there. I'll let the shuffleboard go hang. Come, we'll go\r\nand see the chief engineer, eh, what?\"\r\n\r\nHe assisted Grace and Mrs. Stuart to their feet, and, followed by the\r\nprofessor, they all made their way to Mr. Wetherbee's cabin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe chief engineer, a blunt-spoken Englishman, with bushy side-whiskers,\r\nwas amiability itself, and readily consented to escort his visitors down\r\nto the region where he was king.\r\n\r\n\"There's nothing very attractive down there!\" he said, by way of\r\nwarning.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I'm very anxious to see the poor fellows at the furnaces. It must\r\nbe a most interesting sight,\" exclaimed Grace, with a flush of\r\npleasurable anticipation.\r\n\r\n\"Won't it spoil our frocks?\" demanded Mrs. Stuart, apprehensive of\r\ndamage to her white chiffon gown.\r\n\r\nThe engineer took the question as almost a personal insult.\r\n\r\n\"Bless you, no, m'm. It's as clean as Delmonico's kitchen. We're proud\r\nto show it for that reason. Of course, there's plenty of coal-dust\r\nflying down in the stoking-pit, where the firemen are, but you'll not go\r\nnear enough to hurt. Follow me!\"\r\n\r\nHe led the way through a narrow door amid-ships, on the port side, and\r\nthey found themselves in a steel-lined gallery, well lighted and fitted\r\non all sides with steel ladders, pipes, and valves. The hissing of\r\nescaping steam and the roar of powerful machinery in motion made any\r\nattempt at speaking impossible.\r\n\r\n\"This is the engine-room,\" shouted Mr. Wetherbee.\r\n\r\nLooking down, they saw mighty arms of polished, well-greased steel rise,\r\nswing slowly and descend rapidly on the other side. The huge rods of\r\nmetal ascended and fell again with great rapidity, with a rhythmical,\r\nirresistible sweep that was fascinating to watch, making at each thrust\r\nand uplift a rushing, roaring noise like the simultaneous blows of a\r\nhundred sledge-hammers.\r\n\r\n\"A man was caught in there once,\" shouted the engineer, so as to make\r\nhimself heard above the din. \"It was just before the ship sailed. The\r\npoor fellow noticed that the crank needed oil, and thought he had time\r\nto do it before we started. Just as he was finishing, the signal 'Go\r\nahead' came from the bridge. We didn't know he was in the pit, and we\r\npulled the steam-chest lever. The massive arm rose. He shrieked. Before\r\nwe could stop the machinery, it dropped again, and he was ground to\r\npieces before our eyes.\"\r\n\r\nGrace shuddered while the engineer calmly went on to explain the\r\nparticular use of each part of the wonderful mechanism over which he had\r\nsupreme control, speaking of each with as much affection as if it were\r\nhis own offspring.\r\n\r\n\"Those cranks turn the shaft which gives the propellers their thousand\r\nrevolutions a minute. The vibration you notice is caused by the enormous\r\nsteam pressure. Two hundred pounds of steam pressing against every\r\nsquare inch of boiler surface represents power equal to the strength of\r\n10,000 horses.\" Patting the head of the great beam as it rose to him, he\r\nadded: \"This is the best friend we've got--never tired, always true. But\r\nfor this we should not be cutting through the water at the speed of\r\ntwenty knots an hour.\"\r\n\r\nTurning to an iron staircase on the left, he said:\r\n\r\n\"We'll go now to the boiler-room and see how we make the steam that\r\ngives life to the cylinders.\"\r\n\r\nBeckoning them to follow, he disappeared down a steep stairway, spiral\r\nin form, which reached from the promenade-deck down to the very bottom\r\nof the vessel. The engineer gallantly extended his hand to assist Grace,\r\nand Professor Hanson, not quite sure himself of his footing, made a\r\npretense of rendering similar service to Mrs. Stuart. Mr. Fitzhugh\r\nbrought up the rear, stepping gingerly. Down they went, round and round,\r\nthreading their way along an amazing labyrinth of valves, levers,\r\ngauges, eccentrics, tubes, and steam-pipes. They were now deep down in\r\nthe bowels of the ship, a region with a sickening smell of machine-oil\r\nand steam. Down, down they went, past the coal-bunkers, following the\r\nengineer. The stairway being only imperfectly lighted by electric bulbs,\r\nthey had to tread carefully. It grew perceptibly hotter. Presently they\r\nsaw double rows of boilers set sideways. They were in the stoke-hold.\r\n\r\n\"Look out!\"\r\n\r\nThe warning cry came from Mr. Wetherbee, who stopped short and held out\r\nhis arms to prevent the visitors proceeding any farther. Then he\r\nshouted: \"There are the furnaces! You'd better shade your eyes!\"\r\n\r\nThere was a sudden glare which was almost blinding, a roar of flames\r\nunder forced draught, and a wave of sickening heat. The air all at once\r\nbecame so thick with flying particles of coal that it was difficult to\r\nbreathe. Choking, coughing, Grace and her companions clutched nervously\r\nat the slender guard-rail which alone interposed between the steel\r\ngallery where they stood and the inferno of smell, noise, and heat\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\nAn extraordinary spectacle presented itself to their eyes. In the\r\nblackness underneath, between the rows of boilers, were the\r\nstoking-pits, in which fourteen fires, each raging at a fierce white\r\nheat, glowed angrily like the red cavernous maws of legendary monsters.\r\nThrough the open furnace doors issued a blinding light that only\r\nintensified the surrounding gloom. Standing about, recoiling from the\r\nwithering heat, could be seen a dozen stalwart forms. Every now and then\r\nthey advanced quickly to the furnace, to throw on fresh fuel or to rake\r\nthe glowing coal, and in the vivid light they were seen to be human\r\nbeings, but so begrimed and terrible of aspect as to be well-nigh\r\nunrecognizable as men. They were entirely naked from the waist up, and\r\nso covered with coal-dust from head to heel that they looked like\r\nnegroes. Only the white circles around the bloodshot eyes and their\r\nstraight hair betrayed the true color of their skins. They worked\r\nsilently and resignedly, like men accursed, and doomed for some sin\r\ncommitted to everlasting toil and torment. Mere machines of flesh and\r\nsinew, they executed with the rapidity and expertness of long practise\r\ncertain mechanical movements, their toughened muscles and iron frame\r\nstanding the strain and heat with amazing endurance, sweat literally\r\npouring off their faces and bodies in streams. At moments the heat\r\nbecame intolerable--the stoker himself caught fire. His skin began to\r\nblister, his hair started to smoke. He gave a shout, and a comrade\r\nquickly emptied a bucket of water over him, throwing off a cloud of\r\nsteam. Thus temporarily relieved, he set to his devilish task again. It\r\nwas the hardest kind of labor known to man, but, like the ancient\r\nstoics, the stokers gave no sign of their suffering. They toiled\r\nuncomplainingly in grim silence, as if resigned to accept this degraded,\r\npainful occupation as their proper lot in life. They worked on and on\r\nuntil gradually even their great strength gave out. Overcome by the\r\nappalling heat, suffocating from lack of fresh air, one by one they were\r\nforced to fall back and give place to fresher men.\r\n\r\nThe daintily gowned, carefully groomed passengers from the first cabin\r\nwatched them, fascinated. It was difficult for Grace, who had seen\r\nnothing but plenty around her since she came into the world, to\r\nunderstand that there were human beings so miserably poor, so low down\r\nin the social scale that they had to earn their bread in this way. The\r\nliteralness of the saying \"making a living by the sweat of one's brow\"\r\ndawned upon her for the first time. She was shocked, and then she felt\r\nsorry--sorry that any human being should be so degraded. A sense of\r\nguilt came over her, as if she realized that the luxuries her class\r\nloved and exacted were responsible for this degradation, this\r\nsuffering.\r\n\r\nShe wondered where the refractory fireman was, and presently she\r\nperceived him, emerging from the gloom, approaching the roaring furnace,\r\nsteel rod in hand, to rake the fiery coal, covering his face with his\r\nunemployed hand to ward off the blistering heat. He was easily\r\nrecognizable in spite of his forbidding, ghoulish aspect, towering as he\r\ndid several inches above his comrades. Built like a Hercules, he had a\r\ntorso that would have given joy to the great Praxiteles himself. His\r\nlines were academic, the muscles on his massive yet admirably molded\r\nshoulders and arms stood out like whip-cords, and as he stood before the\r\nopen fire, working the steel rod in and out, one leg thrust forward, the\r\nrest of the body thrown backward to avoid the heat, his pose recalled\r\none of David's Latin warriors about to let fly a javelin at the enemy.\r\n\r\n\"By Jove!\" exclaimed Mr. Fitzhugh. \"There's the chap who made such a\r\nfuss when we sailed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that's the fellow!\" said the chief engineer. \"He's going his\r\n'shift' readily enough now, but we've had a hard time with him. He had\r\nto be driven to work like a dog. He's a surly brute and always ready\r\nfor a fight. You'd better not attract his attention.\"\r\n\r\nSo far, the stokers had not noticed the visitors' presence, but Mr.\r\nFitzhugh's exclamation made them look up. One of the firemen laughed,\r\nand said something in an undertone to a comrade, whereupon the man\r\ngrinned, and, turning to the others, pointed to the Hon. Percy, who,\r\nwith his monocle, his green Tyrolian hat and white spats, looked comical\r\nenough to excite derision. The jeers attracted the attention of\r\nArmitage, who dropped back from the furnace he was cleaning out and\r\nglared up at the intruders. He clenched his fist and ground his teeth as\r\nhe saw these perfumed, pampered passengers watching them as they might\r\nview wild animals in a cage. It made his blood boil to see their clean\r\nskins, their fine clothes. No doubt, they had not done a day's honest\r\nwork in their lives. That animated monkey with the monocle and white\r\nspats, and those dainty dolls in laces and jewels, came simply from idle\r\ncuriosity, to gibe at their dirty, miserable appearance, to mock at\r\ntheir sufferings. The thought maddened him. In a frenzy of rage, he\r\nshook his fist in the direction of the little gallery where Grace and\r\nher party stood.\r\n\r\n\"Get out of here!\" he shouted furiously. \"We don't want you! This isn't\r\na circus! Get out--do you hear?\"\r\n\r\nHe stooped quickly, and, picking up a heavy piece of coal, lifted his\r\narm as if about to hurl it in their direction. Grace, frightened,\r\nrecoiled, and her companions also shrank back. Mr. Fitzhugh and the\r\nprofessor had already bolted up the spiral stairway. The chief engineer\r\nsaid quietly to Grace:\r\n\r\n\"You'd better go. There's no telling how he might excite the other men.\r\nI regret very much that you should have been subjected to his insults.\r\nHe's half-crazy. Leave me to deal with him!\"\r\n\r\nShaking his fist at the fireman, he shouted:\r\n\r\n\"You'll pay for this, Armitage. This means another dose of the\r\n'hospital' for you!\"\r\n\r\n\"Go to hell!\" cried the stoker's hoarse voice.\r\n\r\nGrace and Mrs Stuart were breathless when they reached the deck, and\r\nthey gave a sigh of relief when they were able once more to fill their\r\nlungs with fresh air.\r\n\r\n\"What a shocking place!\" exclaimed Mrs. Stuart, examining her gown to\r\nsee if she had sustained any damage.\r\n\r\n\"What a terrible man!\" echoed Grace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll day it had been uncomfortably hot and oppressive. The blazing sun\r\nlooked like a molten disk in a copper-colored sky. The horizon was\r\nveiled in a sort of milky haze. The sea had quieted down to a dead calm.\r\nThere was not so much as a ripple on the ocean's smooth, oil-like\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nThe big liner was still pounding her way toward Bombay. Another two days\r\nand the passengers would go ashore. Saturday afternoon had already\r\narrived. Sailors were busy rigging canvas and putting up decorations for\r\nthe dance which was to take place that evening. In a cozy corner of the\r\npromenade-deck an animated group, which included Grace, Mrs. Stuart,\r\nMrs. Phelps, Count von Hatzfeld, and Professor Hanson, were taking tea.\r\n\r\n\"I don't see how we can dance in this heat! I think we'd better put off\r\nthe ball, don't you, count?\" exclaimed Grace, appealing to Mrs. Phelps'\r\naristocratic admirer.\r\n\r\nCount Herbert von Hatzfeld was the typical Teuton, tall and blond, with\r\nsoldierly bearing. His mustache had the uptwist dear to the Kaiser. He\r\nhad good teeth, polished ways, and an engaging smile. Like most Germans,\r\nhis speech was stiff and slow, and he sat bolt upright, as if he had\r\naccidentally swallowed a poker, which made it impossible for him to\r\nunbend.\r\n\r\nGrace's suggestion did not seem to appeal to him, for, with a hasty\r\nglance at Mrs. Phelps, who appeared engrossed in something Professor\r\nHanson was saying, he replied:\r\n\r\n\"Ach--that is nothing. I like dancing with you in the heat better than\r\nnot dancing at all.\"\r\n\r\nGrace purposely ignored the compliment. She had no desire to make Mrs.\r\nPhelps jealous; so, hastening to draw the widow into the conversation,\r\nshe leaned over to her.\r\n\r\n\"What do you think about it, Mrs. Phelps? I just told the count that I\r\nthought it too hot to dance to-night. What's your opinion?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, dear, no,\" laughed the widow, fanning herself. \"Let's enjoy\r\nourselves as long as we can. This weather's nothing to what we shall\r\nget in the interior of India. I wouldn't miss the dance for anything.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Stuart, may I trouble you for some more tea?\" asked Professor\r\nHanson, with his customary exaggerated politeness.\r\n\r\n\"You, professor, may have anything,\" replied Mrs. Stuart, with a smile\r\nmeant to be fascinating. Archly she added: \"You know, I call you my\r\nwalking encyclopedia. Just think what you've taught me on this\r\nvoyage--all about ocean currents, the stars, wireless telegraphy. You\r\nare a wonderful man.\"\r\n\r\nThe professor bowed and preened himself as he sugared his tea.\r\n\r\n\"You flatter me, my dear madam. Really, you flatter me. It has been an\r\nhonor and delight to talk with so charming and intelligent a woman.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you hear that, Grace?\" laughed Mrs. Stuart. \"The professor says I'm\r\ncharming and intelligent.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Ja wohl_, it is true--it is true,\" exclaimed the count gallantly. \"You\r\nare very charming. The herr professor vouches for your intelligence\r\nalso. He is more competent than I to pass on that question. But I can\r\ncertainly vouch for your being irresistibly charming.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Phelps frowned. For some reason she seemed to regard Mrs. Stuart as\r\nmore dangerous than Grace. Fanning herself vigorously, she exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"It is hotter than I thought it was. I think we're in a warm corner.\r\nCount, suppose we take a turn on deck.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Ja wohl_--if you wish it,\" responded the German, rising with native\r\npoliteness.\r\n\r\nSomewhat reluctantly, Mrs. Stuart thought, he joined Mrs. Phelps, and\r\nthey walked off briskly together down the deck.\r\n\r\n\"Now they're gone, you'll have to amuse us, professor,\" laughed Mrs.\r\nStuart.\r\n\r\n\"I wish I had some one to fan me,\" complained Grace languidly.\r\n\r\n\"Allow me,\" exclaimed the professor eagerly.\r\n\r\nDapper and enthusiastic, he danced around, and, drawing up a chair, took\r\nthe fan which Grace willingly surrendered. The professor was not\r\nexactly the man of her day-dreams, but he was as good as any one else\r\nto arrange the rugs around her chair or to pick up the things she was\r\ncontinually dropping. No one had seen the Hon. Percy Fitzhugh for the\r\nlast two days. He had not dared to show his face on deck since his\r\nignominious flight from the stoke-hold.\r\n\r\n\"Why is it so sultry, professor?\" asked Grace wearily.\r\n\r\nThe professor fanned her gently, taking mental inventory as the gentle\r\nbreeze he made stirred his companion's veil. Her aristocratic features,\r\nher transparent, satinlike skin, her long silky lashes drooping on a\r\nvelvety cheek, half concealing her dark, soul-disturbing eyes, the\r\nslender white neck and full bosom covered with dainty open laces\r\npartially concealing hidden charms, and an upturned, wistful mouth, with\r\nfull red lips that suggested unholy delights--all this the professor\r\nnoted, and he turned away his head and sighed. For all his science, he\r\nwas, after all, only a man. And, alas, he had a wife at home. Besides,\r\nwho knew better than he--the man of science--the futility of lifting\r\none's eyes to the stars. He fanned on in philosophic silence.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me why is it so hot?\" repeated Grace, quite unconscious of the\r\nemotions she was stirring in her bespectacled _vis-a-vis_.\r\n\r\n\"Really, I don't know,\" said the professor, startled out of his\r\nreveries. Looking around at the sky, he added: \"I think we're going to\r\nhave a change in the weather.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I hope not!\" exclaimed Mrs. Stuart anxiously. \"What makes you think\r\nthat?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" replied the professor, scanning with the expert air of a weather\r\nprophet the distant horizon, where the fiery sun was sinking behind a\r\ngreat mass of purple cloud, \"I don't much like the formation of those\r\nclouds over there. In these latitudes they usually portend a storm of\r\nconsiderable violence. The sultriness, the unnatural calm, are all storm\r\nwarnings to the sailor, and if another proof were wanted, the barometer\r\nhas been falling rapidly all day. We're sure to get something before\r\nlong.\"\r\n\r\n\"Anything's better than this heat,\" yawned Grace. \"I'd love to see a big\r\nstorm, with tremendous waves washing all over the ship.\"\r\n\r\n\"Really, Grace, I think it's horrid of you to talk that way,\" protested\r\nMrs. Stuart, half in jest, half in earnest. \"If we were wrecked or\r\nsomething, it would serve you right.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wouldn't mind being wrecked,\" laughed Grace. \"It would be awfully\r\nromantic--so different from our conventional, humdrum life. Just fancy,\r\nprofessor, if the ship were wrecked and you and I were cast away on a\r\ndesert island, with only monkeys, snakes, and possibly savages for\r\nneighbors!\"\r\n\r\n\"You jest, Miss Harmon,\" replied the professor seriously. \"But such\r\nthings have occurred. Don't you remember what happened to the passengers\r\nof the _Aeon_, when that steamer was wrecked on Christmas Island? The\r\nsurvivors were ten weeks on a barren rock in the South Pacific. One\r\nwoman's hair, which was brown, without a trace of gray, when she sailed\r\non the _Aeon_, turned almost white, as a result of the privations and\r\nnerve strain endured on the island.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I remember reading about it in the papers,\" said Mrs. Stuart.\r\n\"Possibly she lost her hair dye in the panic.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd look pretty with white hair,\" laughed Grace. \"It's the fashion now\r\nto wear tufts of white hair among your own.\"\r\n\r\n\"If a cannibal cooked you _a la fricassee_, it wouldn't matter how you\r\nlooked!\" growled Mrs. Stuart.\r\n\r\n\"Talking of desert islands,\" said the professor thoughtfully, \"a very\r\ninteresting sociological problem might be solved if one had the time to\r\nbe shipwrecked and the courage to put my theory to the test.\"\r\n\r\n\"What theory is that?\" demanded Grace, with languid curiosity.\r\n\r\nThe professor peered dubiously at both women over his gold-rimmed\r\nspectacles, as if questioning their ability to grasp intellectual\r\nproblems of any nature. Then pedantically, pompously, as if addressing a\r\ncollege class, he went on:\r\n\r\n\"Ethnology and sociology, as you are perhaps aware, are pet sciences\r\nwith me. I have always taken keen interest in studying man in his\r\nrelations to his fellow man, particularly in his relations with women.\"\r\n\r\nHe paused, as if afraid he had said something indelicate. Mrs. Stuart\r\nsat up, made her pillows more comfortable, and said, with a laugh:\r\n\r\n\"This sounds interesting. Go on, professor!\"\r\n\r\nThus encouraged, the professor continued:\r\n\r\n\"We must not lose sight of the fact that man as we see him\r\nto-day--clean-shaven, manicured, trouser-creased--is only a step removed\r\nfrom the naked savage ancestor who in the palaeolithic age emerged from\r\nhis cave, club in hand, to defend his family or provide it with food.\r\nThe man of the stone age tore flesh from the skeletons of wild animals\r\nhe slew, and made of his wife a beast of burden. To-day, our city\r\ndweller employs a French _chef_, and buys for his wife a box at the\r\nopera. Conditions have altered radically since the dawn of history,\r\nthousands of years of education and refining influences have tamed the\r\nprimeval man and woman and taught them how to keep their instincts,\r\ntheir passions, under control. Yet the change is far more apparent than\r\nreal. Civilization is purely artificial. It is only a compromise, a\r\nconvention. Our boasted refinement at best is little more than skin\r\ndeep. There's an old saying: 'Scratch a Russian and you'll find a\r\nTartar.' We might also say: 'Scratch civilized man and you'll find a\r\nprimeval brute.' Fundamentally, men and women of to-day are the same as\r\ntheir savage ancestors, they are moved by the same impulses and desires\r\nas when in the dark quaternary epoch they roamed naked through the\r\nvirgin forests, ferocious-looking and bestial in appetite, their matted\r\nhair falling over their brutal faces, their prominent teeth sharp and\r\npointed like wolves' fangs. By nature we are thieves, murderers, liars,\r\ncheats.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have a fine opinion of your fellow men, I must say,\" interrupted\r\nGrace, with a mischievous smile at Mrs. Stuart.\r\n\r\n\"I am stating a cold, scientific fact, and one that is unqualifiedly\r\nendorsed by every self-respecting ethnologist,\" replied the professor\r\nfirmly. \"Civilization,\" he went on, \"teaches us that it is wrong to\r\nkill, to steal, to lie, and society has amended Nature's law by\r\ndecreeing that the murderer shall be executed, the thief imprisoned, the\r\nliar and cheat ostracized. That, frankly, is the chief reason why the\r\nmajority of us behave ourselves. But some men are so constituted that\r\nthey are unable to control their brutal instincts, their evil passions.\r\nMorally and mentally, sometimes physically, even, they resemble in\r\nstriking fashion their savage prototypes of six thousand years ago. For\r\ninstance, take that fireman Armitage--a colossus in physical strength,\r\nobeying only brutal impulses, to all intents and purposes an untutored\r\nbarbarian. Civilization, you see, has done nothing for him. He is the\r\nprimeval man. To me he is interesting, for he proves the truth of my\r\natavistic theory.\"\r\n\r\nGrace yawned. The professor was too deep for her. In fact, she found him\r\nrather tiresome, particularly as she could not guess what he was driving\r\nat. Mrs. Stuart, however, was a more attentive, if somewhat puzzled,\r\nlistener.\r\n\r\n\"But what has all this to do with being wrecked on a desert island?\" she\r\ndemanded.\r\n\r\nThe professor smiled in a superior kind of way.\r\n\r\n\"Allow me to come to my point,\" he said, with a lordly wave of his hand.\r\n\"Suppose a ship like the _Atlanta_, for instance, were wrecked, and the\r\nonly two persons who survived the disaster--a man and a woman--found\r\nthemselves on a desert island, far from the regular track of steamers\r\nand with the remotest chance of any vessel seeing their signal of\r\ndistress. Suppose the man was one of the crew, a common sailor, a brute,\r\nsay, of the type of that Armitage fellow, and the woman one of the\r\nfirst-cabin passengers, a beautiful, highly cultured girl, rich,\r\nluxury-loving, fastidious, such, for instance, as Miss Harmon----\"\r\n\r\n\"Please do me the favor to leave me out of your comparisons,\"\r\ninterrupted Grace coldly. She did not exactly relish the coupling of her\r\nname with that of a disreputable stoker.\r\n\r\n\"Oh--I only wanted to make my meaning as plain as possible,\" stuttered\r\nthe professor, in profuse apology.\r\n\r\n\"Your meaning isn't plain at all!\" retorted Grace, not knowing whether\r\nto laugh or to be angry.\r\n\r\n\"It's about as dense as an Irish Channel fog. But I grasp enough to see\r\nthat it's interesting,\" exclaimed Mrs. Stuart. \"Please don't talk in\r\nparables any longer, professor. Come quickly to the point. I'm getting\r\ninterested.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is the point,\" smiled the professor. \"What would be this man's and\r\nwoman's attitude to each other? Separated under normal social conditions\r\nby the widest gulf imaginable, on the desert island they would be thrown\r\ntogether in the closest intimacy. The highly educated woman, the refined\r\nproduct of centuries of high breeding, would suddenly find herself the\r\nassociate and helpmate of an uncouth, brutal fellow barely redeemed from\r\nbarbarism. Necessity would compel her to look to him for food. Instinct\r\nwould prompt him to build her a shelter from the elements, and to\r\nprotect her from attack. As their enforced sojourn on the island grew\r\nlonger, the common sailor would begin to cast covetous, lustful eyes on\r\nhis involuntary companion, and as each day the hope of rescue became\r\nmore remote, he might insist on ties the very suggestion of which would\r\noverwhelm her with horror. Yet with no one but God above to call upon\r\nfor help, she would be completely at the man's mercy. She would be\r\npowerless to resist or to deny herself. Her refinement, her culture,\r\nher high intelligence, would go for nothing. The primeval man, the\r\nbeast, would assert his rights and only death could save her honor from\r\nthe exercise of his brutal force.\"\r\n\r\n\"What a horrid nightmare to conjure up,\" interrupted Grace, with a\r\nshudder. \"If such a thing happened to me, I'd jump into the sea.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd pick up a carving-knife and stick him in the ribs,\" exclaimed Mrs.\r\nStuart, laughing.\r\n\r\n\"I don't think either of you would do anything of the sort,\" rejoined\r\nthe professor. \"The sailor would quickly pull Miss Harmon out of the\r\nwater, and there wouldn't be carving-knives lying around with which to\r\ndo any rib-sticking. No, you would let Nature work out the problem.\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\" cried both women simultaneously. \"You mean to say that we\r\nshould----\"\r\n\r\n\"No--not at all,\" smiled the professor. \"You go too quickly. I have\r\nmerely stated the sailor's desires. Now, the interesting question\r\narises: Will he exercise his rights as the stronger, will he drag this\r\ndelicate, highly nurtured girl down to his own animal level, or will she\r\nby sheer force of character, by her fine mentality and spiritual force,\r\nbe able to tame the beast and lift him up to her level? That is the\r\nproblem--a most interesting one from the sociological standpoint; but it\r\ncould be solved only by being put to an actual test.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope you don't expect either of us to make the experiment,\" laughed\r\nMrs. Stuart.\r\n\r\n\"If you did, I should certainly aspire to be the sailor,\" retorted,\r\ngallantly, the man of science.\r\n\r\n\"The hypothesis is an interesting one,\" said Grace thoughtfully. \"After\r\nall, the situation is not impossible.\"\r\n\r\nThe professor rubbed his hands with satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\"Quite so--quite so!\" he replied. \"What, in your opinion, would be the\r\noutcome?\"\r\n\r\nFor a moment Grace left the question unanswered. Then, decisively, she\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"Such a girl would never yield. Her training, her pride, her\r\nself-respect, would protect her. She would die before she degraded\r\nherself.\"\r\n\r\n\"The idea is preposterous!\" exclaimed Mrs. Stuart impatiently.\r\n\r\nThe professor shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"My dear ladies, you are both mistaken. I once knew a New York girl,\r\nhighly educated, wealthy, popular with her friends, who gave up\r\neverything, a luxurious home, her position in society, to follow the man\r\nshe loved--a full-blooded Indian--back to the tents of his people.\r\nTo-day that girl is living Indian fashion on a Western reservation. In\r\nplace of her one-time elegance she wears her hair down over her\r\nshoulders, an old blanket keeps her warm, her proud carriage has given\r\nplace to the uncertain, shambling gait, on her back is strapped her\r\nIndian papoose. Her old life is practically blotted out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" interrupted Grace, \"but that is a different case. She loved the\r\nIndian. If the girl on the island loved the sailor, she might fall, too,\r\nbut love should never degrade. On the contrary, it should redeem and\r\nuplift the man.\"\r\n\r\nThe professor nodded approvingly.\r\n\r\n\"Bravo! bravo!\" he cried.\r\n\r\n\"Really, Grace, I had no idea you were so sentimental!\" exclaimed Mrs.\r\nStuart.\r\n\r\n\"In other words,\" went on the professor, addressing the younger woman,\r\n\"you think----\"\r\n\r\n\"I think,\" replied Grace slowly and deliberately, \"that if they found\r\nthey loved each other, she would not quite descend to his level nor\r\nwould he quite ascend to hers. There would be a compromise. In other\r\nwords, she would stoop; he would reach up. That is my view.\"\r\n\r\n\"A most sensible view--most sensible!\" said the professor, with\r\nenthusiasm.\r\n\r\nMrs. Stuart sprang up from her chair. Collecting her wraps, she said:\r\n\r\n\"This debate is highly interesting and instructive, but if I stop to\r\nlisten to any more I shall never be dressed for dinner. Come, Grace,\r\ndon't forget we dine earlier to-night, because of the dance.\"\r\n\r\nThe professor assisted Grace to her feet.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks,\" she said. \"I've enjoyed our talk so much. You've set me\r\nthinking. It's so seldom one is encouraged to think of anything worth\r\nwhile.\"\r\n\r\nThe ladies disappeared below, and the professor, tipping his cap, turned\r\non his heel and continued his walk. On the promenade-deck, where a dozen\r\nsailors were busy preparing for the evening's coming festivities, he\r\nmet Captain Summers, who was enjoying a smoke before dinner.\r\n\r\n\"Well, captain, pretty warm for dancing, eh? Is it going to get any\r\ncooler?\"\r\n\r\nThe captain stopped short and squinted around at the sky. As he took in\r\nthe weather signs, an anxious look came into his face, and he replied\r\ngruffly:\r\n\r\n\"We'll get something to-night, that's sure. The glass is falling\r\nrapidly. But I wouldn't say anything about it to the ladies, if I were\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnclosed with sail-cloth for almost its entire length, brilliantly\r\nilluminated by hundreds of electric bulbs skilfully clustered in the\r\nfolds of the artistically draped bunting, with its crowds of dancers,\r\nthe women with their beautiful gowns, white shoulders and flashing\r\njewels, the ship's officers in full uniform, the men passengers in dress\r\ncoats--the promenade-deck presented an animated scene of gaiety, light,\r\nand color, rendered all the more striking by the sharp contrast with the\r\ninky darkness beyond the steamer's rail. The steward's orchestra,\r\nscreened behind a bank of decorative plants in a railed-off space at the\r\nfar end of the deck, was playing a dreamy Waldteufel waltz, and the gay,\r\nlaughing couples, their faces slightly flushed from champagne, whirling\r\ngracefully to the strains of the languorous music, made up a picture\r\nthat appealed sensuously to ear and eye.\r\n\r\nGrace was dancing with Count von Hatzfeld. In a decollete, clinging gown\r\nof rose-colored chiffon, cut to set off to full advantage her\r\nsnow-white shoulders and perfect figure, never had she looked so\r\nradiant. Around her slender throat was a string of priceless pearls, a\r\ngift from her father, and her hair, dark and lustrous, was arranged in a\r\nGrecian Psyche knot with gold bands. She held undisputed sway as belle\r\nof the ball, and covetous feminine eyes, ardent masculine eyes, followed\r\nher and her lucky partner as they waltzed up and down the deck. Both\r\ntall and graceful, they made a striking couple.\r\n\r\nThe count held her pressed closely to him as they turned slowly to the\r\nmeasured time of the voluptuous music. Her eyes were closed and her head\r\ndrooped slightly on his shoulder. To him it seemed like a taste of\r\nheaven to hold this beautiful creature in such close embrace, and as he\r\ninhaled the subtle aroma that emanated from her skin and hair, like some\r\nexquisite, unfamiliar perfume, intoxicating in its effect, he wondered\r\nhow he could have been such an ass to waste so many precious hours on\r\nMrs. Phelps.\r\n\r\nBut Grace was not thinking of the count. He was not the type of man to\r\ninterest her. She enjoyed dancing for itself, and she abandoned herself\r\nto it without a thought of the man who might happen to be her partner.\r\nShe loved the graceful, rhythmical movement of the waltz, the rapid\r\nwhirling round and round which made her heart beat tumultuously, the\r\nlanguorous music which intoxicated. She loved the luxury of costly\r\ncostumes, the odor of beautiful flowers, the sparkle of diamonds and the\r\ncareless gaiety and unconsequential chatter of the people of her own\r\nset. In short, hers was purely a sensual enjoyment--not materially\r\ndifferent to that she aroused in the men--but she did not realize it.\r\n\r\n\"_Ach_, this is divine!\" whispered the count. \"May I have the next\r\nwaltz?\"\r\n\r\nAt that moment a couple brushed past them.\r\n\r\n\"There's Mrs. Phelps with Mr. Fitzhugh,\" said Grace mischievously. \"She\r\nwould scratch my eyes out if she caught me dancing with you again so\r\nsoon.\"\r\n\r\n\"I care not,\" replied the German recklessly and ardently. \"When I see\r\nyour eyes, the world is dead to me.\"\r\n\r\nA compliment of this kind would have pleased most women, but Grace was\r\naccustomed to them. They rather irritated her.\r\n\r\n\"I'm tired now,\" she said languidly. \"Please take me to my seat.\"\r\n\r\nThey joined Mrs. Stuart, who, comfortably ensconced in a corner, was\r\nflirting desperately with Mr. Brown, the second officer, a tall,\r\nhandsome man, smart-looking in his full-dress uniform and white gloves.\r\nThe count murmured his thanks, bowed, and retired.\r\n\r\n\"I'm so thirsty!\" gasped Grace, sinking into a chair. \"I wish I had an\r\nice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Allow me to get you one,\" said Mr. Brown.\r\n\r\nBefore she could protest, the second officer had disappeared in the\r\ndirection of the saloon, where an elaborate supper was laid out.\r\n\r\nMrs. Stuart turned to her protegee:\r\n\r\n\"Grace, you've made a tremendous hit to-night. Your pearls look\r\nmagnificent. All the women are raving about them.\"\r\n\r\n\"They ought to be,\" replied Grace indifferently. \"They cost enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"Forty thousand, didn't you say?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think that's what dad paid.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lucky girl! They might be glass for all you seem to care.\"\r\n\r\nGrace made a gesture of impatience as she answered:\r\n\r\n\"What good are they? Merely pretty gewgaws. Their value means nothing to\r\nme. I'm sick of hearing what things cost. They won't bring me what I\r\nwant most.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's that--a husband?\" smiled Mrs. Stuart.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Grace petulantly. \"A husband--a man I could respect\r\nenough to want to marry. I lose patience with all these animated monkeys\r\nthat dangle after me. I want a real man.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not very kind to the count after he's been so attentive to you all the\r\nevening,\" replied Mrs. Stuart, elevating her eyebrows. \"No wonder you're\r\ntired, after dancing every single dance. I should be dead in your place.\r\nIt's all very well to be the belle of the ball, but it's wearing on the\r\nnerves. I'm satisfied to play wallflower and talk to the second officer.\r\nYou've no idea how perfectly fascinating he is. His gold braid and\r\nbuttons are too cute for anything! What was the count breathing down\r\nyour neck?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, a lot of foolishness!\" laughed Grace.\r\n\r\n\"Take care,\" exclaimed Mrs. Stuart, holding up a warning finger. \"I saw\r\nMrs. Phelps glaring at you several times. Besides, Germans make\r\nimpossible husbands. The common German is gross, the educated German is\r\nconceited. Both are insufferable. You'd be miserable.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't be alarmed, dear,\" smiled Grace. \"I think no more of the count\r\nthan I do of those musicians, not so much. Their music charms and he\r\nbores.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Brown reappeared, followed by a steward carrying a tray on which\r\nwere ices and _petits fours_.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, how perfectly sweet of you!\" exclaimed Mrs. Stuart. \"I was dying\r\nfor an ice--the heat is positively dreadful.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's getting warmer every minute,\" panted Grace. \"I can hardly breathe.\r\nI think we're going to have a storm, don't you, Mr. Brown?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh--I don't know,\" replied the officer hesitatingly. \"It's always hot\r\nin these latitudes, you know. This is nothing to what you'll get in\r\nBombay.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I know,\" said Grace, nibbling daintily at the delicious frozen\r\ndelicacy, \"but there's something weird in the unnatural stillness of the\r\nair. I don't like to see the water so calm.\"\r\n\r\nThe second officer shifted uneasily about on his feet. He knew well that\r\nthere was every indication of a storm. The barometer had been falling\r\nsteadily for hours. The latest reading marked ten-twenty-nine, which was\r\nthe lowest he had ever seen it. The captain, too, was uneasy. In fact,\r\nthey were only waiting for the dance to break up to hurry and get\r\neverything shipshape for the blow which they knew was inevitable.\r\nMeantime, he argued to himself, there was no use in alarming the ladies\r\nor spoiling their fun. He was about to put off further questioning by\r\nsome reassuring remark, when just then a quartermaster ran up, and,\r\ntouching his cap, said:\r\n\r\n\"Cap'n wishes to see you on the bridge, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, I'll come at once.\"\r\n\r\nTurning to the ladies, Mr. Brown excused himself, and, with a salute,\r\nwent away, followed by the sailor.\r\n\r\nThe gaiety was now at its height. It was impossible to move about the\r\ndeck, so crowded was it with dancers and promenaders. Suddenly the\r\nconcealed orchestra struck up the dulcet strains of Strauss' _Blue\r\nDanube_, and once more the couples began gliding and turning on the\r\nspotless deck, the women's gowns making a beautiful and ever-changing\r\nkaleidoscope of color and motion. Everybody was in high spirits. The\r\nwomen were flirting and drinking champagne. The men were laughing and\r\nhaving what the Hon. Percy Fitzhugh declared a ripper of a good time. It\r\nwas a festival of fortune's favorites, a merrymaking of those lucky few\r\nwho have nothing to do but enjoy life's pleasures.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nUp on top of the deckhouse, hidden among the ventilators and\r\nsmokestacks, two men gloomily watched the gay scene below. They were\r\ngrimy with coal-dust and they wore greasy clothes, with tattered coats\r\nbuttoned close to their necks. Hot as was the night, it felt cool to\r\nthem, accustomed as they were to the withering heat of the furnaces\r\nbelow. One was Armitage; the other was Bill. The two stokers had crawled\r\nout of the inferno to steal a breath of fresh air. The scene before them\r\nseemed like a vision of fairyland.\r\n\r\n\"Gee whiz!\" exclaimed Bill, when he had somewhat recovered from his\r\nastonishment. \"It's like at the theayter. Get on to 'em lights and the\r\nflags, will ye, and the bloomin' musicians! Look at 'em women folk\r\ndancin' all decked out in their sparklers, and 'em blokes wid their\r\nopen-faced clothes! Officers, too, has on their Sunday duds. And, by\r\ngosh! If they ain't drinkin' fizz! Say, ain't it great to be rich!\"\r\n\r\n\"Let them dance!\" growled Armitage savagely, as he sullenly watched the\r\nmerry crowd. \"They'd dance to another tune if the boilers were suddenly\r\nto burst, or if the ship ran foul of a rock.\" Fiercely, he added: \"D--n\r\n'em! I'd like to see them down on their blessed knees, weeping and\r\npraying!\"\r\n\r\nTo him these men and women, enjoying themselves in fine clothes, with\r\nplenty of money, without a care, represented the enemy. They belonged\r\nto the class that had wronged him, the world that had been trampling on\r\nhim all these years. They were those who laughed when he suffered, who\r\nthrew him a bone as one does to a dog. How he hated them! He ground his\r\nteeth at the consciousness of his own impotence to do them injury.\r\n\r\n\"That's all right!\" grinned Bill. \"But anythin' as happens to 'em would\r\ncatch us, too. I ain't ready for Davy Jones' locker yet.\"\r\n\r\nStill watching the brilliant crowd below, as if fascinated, Armitage\r\nreplied with an oath:\r\n\r\n\"I'm ready for anything. I'd just as soon go to the bottom as not. What\r\ndo you fellows get out of life, anyhow? Nothing but hard work, kicks,\r\nand curses--scarcely enough to eat, while those swells have more than\r\nthey know what to do with. And they never earned a cent of it.\"\r\nSavagely, he went on: \"It's dead wrong, I tell you. Why should one come\r\ninto the world poor and the other rich? Do you wonder I hate them?\"\r\n\r\nOn the deck beneath, Grace rose from her chair and took Count von\r\nHatzfeld's proffered arm. The count had been most persistent in asking\r\nfor another dance, and to get rid of his importunities, she had\r\nconsented. Slowly they began to turn to the charming strains of the\r\n_Fledermaus_ waltz, their tall, graceful figures making them conspicuous\r\namong all the other dancers.\r\n\r\n\"Say!\" exclaimed Bill. \"Does ye see that tall gal dancin' wid the guy\r\nwid the Dutch whiskers? Ain't she a stunner?\"\r\n\r\nArmitage's eyes followed those of his mate until they alighted on Grace,\r\nwhen they were immediately arrested. For a few minutes he said nothing,\r\nwatching in silence the proud beauty who was the cynosure of every eye\r\non deck. With growing interest he took mental note of her dark, flashing\r\neyes, her slender neck and snow-white shoulders, her splendid figure,\r\nbeautiful hair, and graceful carriage.\r\n\r\n\"She's pretty, all right!\" he muttered, at last. \"Look at those pearls\r\nround her neck. They're worth a fortune. Isn't she one of those women\r\nwho came down to the stoke-hold the other day?\"\r\n\r\nBefore Bill could reply there was a flash of lightning, followed by a\r\nsharp clap of thunder. The sail-cloths began to flap ominously. On\r\ntheir grimy faces the two stokers felt drops of rain.\r\n\r\n\"We're in for it!\" cried Bill. \"Did ye see 'em storm-clouds?\"\r\n\r\nThere was another glare, more vivid than the first, followed almost\r\nimmediately by a report that left no doubt of the violence of the storm\r\nwhich was fast approaching. The flash revealed a mass of low-lying\r\nclouds, swollen with moisture to the bursting point, around which danced\r\nlurid green flames. The wind was rising rapidly with a sinister moan.\r\nThe sea, while still smooth, was seething and covered with foam like\r\nwater boiling.\r\n\r\n\"It's goin' to be a corker!\" shouted Bill. \"Let's get in before it\r\nbreaks.\"\r\n\r\nWithout waiting to see if Armitage was following him, he ran back to the\r\nventilator up which both men had climbed, and disappeared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nBelow on the promenade-deck all was excitement and confusion. The peal\r\nof thunder had spread consternation among the women, and there was a\r\ngeneral stampede for shelter.\r\n\r\nThe first rush of wind played terrible havoc with the bunting. The\r\nfloral decorations were scattered in all directions. Part of the canvas\r\nawning was torn down. Chairs, tables, and glasses crashed to the deck.\r\nAmid the uproar were heard the harsh commands of the ship's officers,\r\nand the running here and there of sailors, as they hastened to execute\r\norders. The wind squall died away as quickly as it had come, and for a\r\nbrief spell the turmoil was succeeded by an unnatural quiet. Some of the\r\npassengers, inexperienced in weather signs, thought the worst was over,\r\nbut the wiseacres shook their heads. It was the lull before the\r\nonrushing storm.\r\n\r\nGrace and Mrs. Stuart had fled inside at the first alarm, and they both\r\nstood at the saloon entrance, peering nervously into the darkness\r\nbeyond the rail, anxiously questioning Professor Hanson and Count von\r\nHatzfeld, who tried to reassure them. The Honorable Percy Fitzhugh, his\r\nface white and visibly nervous, was so excited that he stuck his monocle\r\nin the wrong eye.\r\n\r\n\"I don't think it will amount to much,\" asserted the professor, in his\r\npompous, authoritative way.\r\n\r\nThe words were barely spoken when he was rudely contradicted. Another\r\nblinding flash rent the heavens, revealing great masses of\r\nforbidding-looking clouds scudding across the sky and hanging so low\r\nthat they seemed almost to touch the water. A terrific report followed,\r\nwhich shook the ship.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I'm so frightened!\" wailed Mrs. Stuart, clinging nervously to Mr.\r\nFitzhugh's arm, much to the annoyance of that gentleman, who felt none\r\ntoo comfortable himself.\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense, Cora, don't be so foolish!\" protested Grace. \"We're perfectly\r\nsafe here, no matter what happens.\"\r\n\r\n\"She's beginning to roll,\" said the professor, as the ship gave a sudden\r\nlurch.\r\n\r\n\"Why are we rolling--is it getting rough?\" asked Grace, who was\r\nbeginning to show signs of trepidation. \"There doesn't seem to be any\r\nwind.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's so deuced dark one can't see a bally thing!\" stammered Mr.\r\nFitzhugh.\r\n\r\nThe night was pitch-dark, and after the brilliancy of the electric\r\nlights, to which their eyes had grown accustomed all evening, the\r\nsurrounding wall of blackness seemed all the more opaque and\r\nimpenetrable. Still, there was no wind, and the heat was suffocating.\r\nThe uncanny silence continued. What could be seen of the sea was smooth,\r\nand oily, and illuminated in spots with green phosphorescent lights. A\r\ndeep swell had set in. Rolling in great billows from the south, it\r\ncaused the steamer to rock so violently that the women had to hold fast\r\nin order to keep their feet.\r\n\r\n\"Isn't this rolling horrible? Each minute I imagine the steamer is going\r\nto turn over!\" exclaimed Mrs. Stuart, so alarmed that she hardly knew\r\nwhat she was saying.\r\n\r\n\"A heavy swell like this,\" explained the professor calmly, \"either\r\nfollows a gale or comes in advance of one. This sea is evidently the\r\nforerunner of a storm. The ladies had better go below before it gets any\r\nworse.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wouldn't think of going to bed,\" declared Mrs. Stuart emphatically.\r\n\"Just think if we had to take to the boats and I were in my\r\ncurl-papers.\"\r\n\r\nStill no wind; only a weird moaning in the distance, which was\r\ndistinctly audible amid the profound, mysterious silence. The lightning,\r\nnow more frequent, revealed a sky terrifying in aspect. The suspense was\r\nnerve-racking to the stoutest hearted. The captain was heard shouting\r\norders on the bridge. Officers and sailors hurried aft, and, driving the\r\npassengers below, closed and barricaded the storm doors. Gathered at the\r\nport-holes, their anxiety increasing each moment, the passengers waited\r\nand watched. Momentarily, the sea grew more convulsive. The waves\r\nincreased perceptibly in size, and the ship rocked more violently.\r\nNearer and nearer came that weird, depressing, wailing sound, like the\r\nmoaning of all the unhappy souls that were ever drowned in the\r\ntreacherous waters of the deep. Grace and her companions, now\r\nthoroughly alarmed, felt that something extraordinary was about to\r\nhappen, and it did.\r\n\r\nAll at once it came. There was a blinding sheet of greenish flame,\r\nfollowed by a deafening report. Then hell itself broke loose. The\r\nhurricane was upon them. It came with a terrifying rush of air, which,\r\nscreeching and howling, raced along at a velocity of a hundred miles an\r\nhour, accompanied by torrents of rain. Nothing could withstand the\r\nwhirlwind's fearful force. Everything loose on deck was instantly swept\r\naway. The Marconi aerial wires, snapping like twine, were rendered\r\nuseless in an instant, the life-boats strained at their lashings, the\r\nair was full of flying debris, the officers on the bridge held on for\r\ntheir lives. The sea, now rising rapidly and worked into a frenzy by the\r\nforce of the wind, was nothing but a waste of seething foam. The huge\r\nsteamer heeled over at the first shock, and great, green seas, capped\r\nwith foam, began to break upon the decks. Inside, the stewards ran here\r\nand there, closing ports, while the passengers, scared out of their\r\nwits, were gathered in the big dining-saloon, gathering such comfort as\r\nthey could by ceaseless questioning of the busy ship's officers.\r\n\r\n\"Is there any danger, Mr. Brown?\" Grace asked the second officer, as he\r\nhurried past.\r\n\r\n\"No--no danger at all!\" he laughed unconcernedly. \"Just a little blow,\r\nthat's all. No storm that was ever brewed could sink this ship.\"\r\n\r\nGrace was reassured, and she breathed more freely, but Mrs. Stuart was\r\nskeptical.\r\n\r\n\"Ship's officers never acknowledge there is danger,\" she said crossly.\r\n\"They wouldn't admit it even if we were all struggling for our lives in\r\nthe water.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, there's no question that the ship is staunch enough,\" said the\r\nprofessor. \"The only cause for alarm would be if the hurricane blew us\r\nout of our course and the steamer were to run on a rock.\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke there was a terrifying crash of glass and an inrush of\r\nwater. Mrs. Stuart screamed, and stewards ran from all directions. A\r\ngiant wave had broken the great glass dome over the dining-room, and the\r\nwater was pouring down in torrents.\r\n\r\n\"What will become of us? Where can we go?\" wailed Mrs. Stuart.\r\n\r\n\"The staterooms are the best place in a storm,\" said the professor.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Grace. \"Let's go to my stateroom. It's large enough to hold\r\nus all. We can be miserable together. Come.\"\r\n\r\nThey followed Grace, leaving the stewards to mop up the water.\r\n\r\nThe tempest had now reached its height. The shrieking of the wind and\r\nthe thunderous blows of the terrific seas, as they broke against the\r\nsides of the ship, was terrifying to listen to. The boldest among the\r\nmen passengers no longer concealed their anxiety, and most of the women\r\nwere in a mental condition bordering on panic. Mrs. Phelps refused to\r\nfollow the example of Grace and retire to her stateroom. She preferred,\r\nshe said, to be where she could get out easily if anything happened. So\r\nwith a stiff brandy and soda to give her courage, and Count von Hatzfeld\r\nto keep her company, the widow prepared to sit out the night in company\r\nwith a crowd of other frightened passengers, who sat all huddled\r\ntogether in a sheltered corner of the dining-saloon.\r\n\r\nUp on the deck, where duty compelled the officers and crew to expose\r\nthemselves to the full fury of the storm, the scene was wild beyond\r\ndescription. The force of the wind was extraordinary. It was impossible\r\nto face it and breathe. The noise was deafening. What with the continual\r\nroar of the now raging sea, the screeching of the tempest and the crash\r\nof thunder, the tumult was appalling. The officers on the bridge, clad\r\nall in oilskins, hung on for their lives, shouting orders through\r\nmegaphones.\r\n\r\nA tremendous sea was running and the _Atlanta_ labored heavily. She\r\nrolled so badly that it seemed impossible that she could ever right\r\nherself again, and every now and then there came a lurch that strained\r\nall the joints, throwing everybody off their feet. The promenade-deck,\r\nswept by foaming green water, was practically afloat. One giant comber\r\nafter another broke over the rail with a thunderous roar, sending up\r\nclouds of spray that completely hid the bridge from sight. The night was\r\npitch-dark. Only the intermittent flashes of lightning permitted a\r\nglimpse of the raging ocean. It being impossible to see farther than a\r\nship's length ahead, the officers on the bridge were ready for any\r\nemergency. The lookouts had been doubled, and the engines slowed down.\r\nCaptain Summers had left nothing undone to ensure the safety of the\r\npassengers entrusted to his care and skill, but it was evident from the\r\nway in which he bent forward and strained his eyes in an effort to\r\npenetrate the murk ahead, that the situation was critical.\r\n\r\nAmong those exposed to the weather on the upper decks there was only one\r\nwho watched with grim indifference the fury of the hurricane. The\r\nfiercer the wind blew, the angrier grew the ocean, the higher rose\r\nArmitage's spirits. When the tremendous seas began to break over the\r\nvessel, the stoker exulted. He was still among the ventilators where\r\nBill had left him, not having had time to retreat before the storm\r\nbroke. Caught by the first rush of wind, he was hurled violently against\r\nan iron stanchion and knocked senseless. When he came to, he found\r\nhimself clinging desperately to a rail, with the hurricane blowing right\r\nover him. The force of the wind was inconceivable. He tried to stagger\r\nto his feet and resist it, but he could not move. The atmosphere was\r\nfull of a rushing, irresistible force which suffocated him. The rain,\r\ndriven with merciless violence, blinded him. He could neither breathe\r\nnor see. His ears were deafened by the unearthly screeching of the wind\r\nand the constant roar of the waves. A flash rent the surrounding\r\nblackness. He caught a glimpse of the water convulsed in a fury, the\r\ndecks below swept by foaming seas, the ship's officers and crew running\r\nexcitedly about.\r\n\r\nIt flashed upon him suddenly that the steamer was in danger, yet,\r\ninstead of making him tremble with apprehension, the thought stirred\r\nwithin him a thrill of savage exultation. Why should he care? Only those\r\nwho enjoyed life had reason to recoil from death. What joys did life\r\nhold out to him? He could never redeem the past. He was tired of the\r\nstruggle. He had knocked about the world long enough. He would be\r\ndischarged on the steamer's return to port, and it would be hard, if not\r\nimpossible, to find another job. Luck was certainly against him. What\r\nwas the use of bucking against one's luck? It would be as well to have\r\ndone with it all. A jump into the sea, a moment's choking and\r\ninvoluntary struggle with the waves, and all would be over. His jaws\r\nclosed with a click, and a hard expression came into his eyes. If this\r\nwas to be the end of all his hardships and suffering, at least he would\r\nnot go alone. Those first-cabin passengers, with their dainty frocks and\r\nfastidious manners--they would have to take the same watery road as he.\r\nThe rich and the poor, the happy and the wretched--all are equal in the\r\npresence of Death. And as each second the hurricane increased in fury,\r\nand the ship plunged more heavily, he had a sense of savage joy as, in\r\nhis mind, he pictured the final catastrophe, the wild scramble for the\r\nboats, and the final screams and death struggles in the boiling waves.\r\n\r\nSuddenly there was a deafening roar. He heard warning shouts, followed\r\nby the splintering of wood and the smashing of glass. Then came a solid\r\nwall of green water. A mountainous sea swept clean over the place where\r\nhe lay, and passed on, leaving him bruised and gurgling for breath. Only\r\nthe rail had prevented him from being carried bodily over the side. A\r\ngiant wave had crashed down on the ship, twisting rails, smashing\r\nlife-boats, and deluging the interior of the ship with tons of water.\r\nBelow could be heard the shouts of the passengers. A moment later,\r\nwithout further warning, came another and more serious shock, a series\r\nof bumps on the ship's bottom, accompanied by a harsh, rending sound.\r\nThe steamer stopped and trembled from bow to stern. There was a grinding\r\nsound. The vessel listed and heeled far over. The engines suddenly\r\nstopped. The siren began to blow dismally. The officers were shouting.\r\nThe _Atlanta_ had run on a rock.\r\n\r\nIn the saloon and staterooms all was chaos and confusion. The electric\r\nlights had gone out, the sudden inrush of water having extinguished the\r\nfurnaces. Already the scared firemen were climbing up from the\r\nstoke-hold like rats escaping from a sinking ship. Every one realized\r\nthat the steamer was doomed, yet there was no panic. The imminence of\r\nthe peril seemed to have stricken every one dumb, passengers and\r\nstewards alike. Hardly a sound was heard except the quick orders given\r\nby the officers and the noise of the passengers' footfalls, as they\r\nhastened up on deck. Every one was cool. The men retained their\r\nself-possession, the women their fortitude. There was no sign of\r\nhysteria. On every one's face was a tense look of quiet anxiety, as if\r\nit was realized that death was near, and each had summoned up courage to\r\nmeet it bravely. Even Mrs. Stuart, white-faced and half fainting, did\r\nnot give way entirely. She and Grace, assisted by Professor Hanson, made\r\ntheir way as quickly as they could to the deck where, all huddled\r\ntogether, they patiently waited for the sailors to lower the boats. The\r\nwaves were running mountain high. What use were the life-boats in such a\r\nsea? Grace's lips moved in prayer.\r\n\r\nArmitage, still clinging to the rail, watched the sailors as they worked\r\nrapidly at the davits to lower the boats. This, he said to himself, was\r\ncertainly the end. No boat could live in those tremendous seas. They\r\nwould all drown like rats. He saw the Honorable Percy Fitzhugh, still in\r\nhis spats and green Tyrolian hat, but very humble now, and white-faced,\r\nstanding by the girl he had seen dancing--the proud beauty with the big\r\ndark eyes. She was pale and silent, yet she did not give way to\r\nhysterical emotion. He admired her for her pluck. She was spunky--that\r\nwas evident. Some women got into a boat, which was lowered away in\r\nsafety. Another was let down, loaded to the gunwale with human freight.\r\nJust as it touched the water there came a tremendous wave, the fragile\r\nboat was tossed high in the air, and in an instant its occupants were\r\nstruggling in the water. There were women's screams and men's shouts,\r\nthen a sinister silence. Armitage laughed. At last he had the upper\r\nhand. These swell cabin passengers drowning there before his eyes were\r\nafraid of death, while he welcomed it. He felt grateful that this much\r\nrevenge had been vouchsafed him. The cries of the dying, the frightful\r\ntumult raised by this death orgy of wind and sea, instead of frightening\r\nhim, sounded in his ears like the most sublime music he had ever heard.\r\n\r\nAs the doomed ship settled deeper on the reef, the waves broke on board\r\nwith redoubled force. It was only a question of minutes when the huge\r\nhulk would begin to go to pieces. Suddenly there was a terrific\r\nexplosion, the deck rose under him, and the next thing he knew he was in\r\nthe sea, battling with the waves.\r\n\r\nHe was an expert, powerful swimmer, and he found himself struggling for\r\nlife in spite of himself. He tried to stop swimming, to let himself\r\nsink. He could not. The instinct of self-preservation was too strong. So\r\nhe swam on, now resting, now floating. He saw nothing of the ship or of\r\nthe boats. He presumed some got away. He heard shouts, but paid no heed.\r\nSteadily he swam on, wondering when his strength would give out and\r\nnature would let him drown. All at once he bumped against something\r\nsoft.\r\n\r\n\"Save me!\" cried a woman's voice weakly.\r\n\r\nInstinctively he put out his hand and caught her by the hair just as she\r\nwas going down for the second time. Her eyes were closed and her face\r\npale as death. It was the tall girl with the dark eyes. If she had not\r\nspoken he would have thought she was dead. Supporting her firmly with\r\none hand and keeping her head above water, he swam on. He wondered why\r\nhe took the trouble. He would tire soon and then both must sink. But he\r\nswam on, with Grace limp, unconscious, half drowned at his side. He felt\r\nhe was unable to stay afloat much longer. His left arm was already numb\r\nfrom the girl's dead weight. Every muscle in his body ached. The end\r\nmust soon come. Why not let her go now and have done with it?\r\n\r\nSuddenly he heard a sound that gave him renewed energy. It was the\r\nroaring noise of heavy surf beating on the shore. They must be close in\r\nland. Another determined effort and perhaps he could get in. Desperately\r\nexerting the last of his great strength, he swam on. A monster wave\r\ncarried him forward, high on its crest, and as the water retired he felt\r\nsand underneath his feet. Another billow carried them in still farther.\r\nHe was in a maelstrom; he could not see; there was a rushing, roaring\r\nsound in his ears. A wave knocked him down, and they were both nearly\r\nsuffocated as they rolled over and over in the boiling water. He\r\nstaggered to his feet and was again dragging her in when a receding wave\r\nsnatched them back. Then came another and bigger wave which threw them\r\nin again. This time he dug his feet desperately in the shifting sand,\r\nand, by a herculean effort, resisted the deadly suck of the undertow.\r\nThe wave receded, leaving them still higher. Before another could reach\r\nthem he had picked his unconscious companion up in his arms, and\r\nstaggered up the beach safe out of the clutch of the water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n\r\nDawn broke, gray and wet. Although the storm had spent its fury and the\r\nwind had quieted down to a gentle breeze, the sea still ran mountains\r\nhigh and a fine rain was falling. But there was promise of clearing\r\nweather. Low on the eastern horizon a fringe of fiery red broke through\r\nthe leaden clouds, putting in relief the water-line and heralding the\r\nnear approach of sunrise. Away out yonder, far beyond the towering,\r\nwhite-capped breakers, protruded the jagged points of the treacherous\r\nsunken reef on which the ill-fated _Atlanta_ had crashed to her doom.\r\n\r\nArmitage strained his eyes in every direction until they ached. With the\r\ncoming of daylight he had expected to get a glimpse of the wreck;\r\npossibly he would see people still on board, signaling for help. But as\r\nthe darkness paled and he was able to distinguish water and sky through\r\nthe receding gloom, he saw, to his amazement, that the steamer had\r\ncompletely disappeared. He perceived pieces of wreckage, and, near the\r\nreef, he thought he spied an upturned boat, but of the big steamer and\r\nthe other life-boats which got away before the boilers exploded, there\r\nwas not a sign. Nothing but a desolate waste of tossing gray water met\r\nhis eyes everywhere.\r\n\r\nAs far as he could make out they were on an island. He had no idea how\r\nlarge it was, or if it was deserted or inhabited. He had heard his\r\nshipmates talk of islands in the Indian Ocean that were a peril to\r\nnavigation, and he supposed this was one of them. When it got lighter he\r\nwould be better able to take his bearings.\r\n\r\nHe was exhausted and weak after his long struggle with the waves, and\r\nhis brine-soaked clothes hung heavily on him. Yet he no longer looked\r\nthe same man he had been on the ship. The transformation in his\r\nappearance was startling; the long swim had effected a wonderful change.\r\nAll trace of coal-dust had disappeared from his face and neck; once more\r\nhe was a white man. His hands were cut and bleeding from the sharp\r\nrocks, and his body was bruised from head to foot, but nothing could\r\nconceal the fact that his bearing had distinction, that his head was\r\nwell shaped, his features clean cut, that he had a strong mouth and a\r\nclear eye.\r\n\r\nBut he was supremely unconscious of how he looked. He was desperately\r\nhungry. His throat was dry and parched. His brine-soaked clothes hung\r\nheavily on him. His senses and consciousness seemed numbed. In truth, he\r\nmarveled to find himself alive. Why had he exhausted and bruised himself\r\nstruggling with the waves, fighting death, when he had no desire to\r\nlive? Yes, he remembered now. It was the girl's fault. She had cried out\r\nto him, and somehow, in spite of himself, he had clutched at her and\r\nsaved her from drowning.\r\n\r\nHe clenched his fists and muttered an oath as he turned to look at her.\r\nShe was still lying, apparently unconscious, in the spot where he had\r\ncarried her after they both staggered out of the jaws of death, and\r\nfell, exhausted, on the wild, storm-swept beach. His first instinct on\r\ngaining a foothold safe from the deadly suck of the thundering breakers\r\nhad been to find for his helpless companion some kind of shelter from\r\nthe wind and rain, and as he was assisting her over the slippery stones,\r\ngreen with slimy sea grass, they accidentally stumbled across a wide\r\nopening in the face of the precipitous cliff. Nearer inspection showed\r\nit to be a deep crevice, hollowed out of the solid rock in past ages by\r\nthe action of the water. The sea had since receded, leaving a kind of\r\ncave, of no great height or depth, yet large enough to accommodate half\r\na dozen persons. The interior was dry, while the thick growth of velvety\r\nmoss underfoot provided a comfortable couch.\r\n\r\n\"A shipwrecked young woman couldn't wish for more luxurious quarters,\"\r\nmuttered Armitage grimly to himself, and after he had taken mental note\r\nof the natural advantages of the place, he turned to look at the\r\nprostrate girl.\r\n\r\nAs yet Grace had given no sign of life. Her eyes were closed and her\r\nface livid. But for the nervous twitching of her mouth, and a low moan\r\nwhich from time to time escaped her lips, one might think she was dead.\r\nHer head was thrown back against the cold, damp wall, her beautiful,\r\nlong hair, matted by sea water, was all disheveled. Water ran off every\r\npart of her and formed a little puddle by her side. Her dainty\r\nball-dress, the envy of every woman on board only a few hours before,\r\nwas in shreds. What remained of it, soaked and discolored, clung closely\r\nto her figure, revealing to Armitage's gaze outlines which caused the\r\nblood to rush tumultuously to his head. Her low-necked gown, torn during\r\nthe panicky rush for the life-boats, had collapsed entirely at one side,\r\nexposing part of the delicately rounded, blue-veined bosom, and\r\nshoulders and arms as white and academically beautiful as if cut in\r\nmarble by the sculptor's chisel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NEVER IN HIS LIFE HAD HE BEHELD A WOMAN SO FAIR.]\r\n\r\nArmitage stood transfixed, his pulse throbbing furiously, his heart in\r\nhis mouth. For a moment the beast was aroused. His eyes sparkled\r\nsensually, incoherent sounds issued from between his clenched teeth. A\r\nkiss on that gently curved, sensitive mouth would be as near a taste of\r\nheaven as ever he would get. He'd be a fool to hesitate. They were\r\nalone--he and this girl--not a human being was within a thousand miles\r\nof them. The chances of rescue were infinitesimal. They had escaped the\r\nwaves only to die of starvation--that was certain. If they must\r\ndie--to-day--to-morrow--or the next day--why deny oneself any joy that\r\nthe world still had to offer? Thus he argued, not in these words, but in\r\nfeverish, unreasoning, reckless thought. Boldly he approached her. His\r\nface was flushed, his eyes were ardent as they took in every voluptuous\r\ndetail of her motionless form. He advanced closer, and, bending over\r\nher, stood for a moment fascinated by the sight of her bare,\r\nalabaster-like skin and perfectly modeled arms. Never in his life had he\r\nbeheld a woman so fair.\r\n\r\nSuddenly she stirred and uttered a low moan. Armitage sprang back and\r\nlooked around guiltily. Only the screaming sea-gulls were there to\r\nwitness his discomfiture, yet his face had the expression of one\r\ndetected in an unworthy action. Again Grace moaned and stirred as if in\r\npain. He stood irresolute, embarrassed, not knowing what to do to help\r\nher, trying to feel that he didn't care, surly and ill-tempered because\r\nhe felt contempt for himself. What was this woman's suffering to him?\r\nShe belonged to the class he now hated, the detested plutocracy upon\r\nwhich he had declared war. The money she spent on her finery and\r\npleasures was no doubt gotten by cheating such poor fellows as he out of\r\ntheir rights. Let her have her share of hard knocks. He chuckled to\r\nhimself as he reflected on life's ironies. Only a few brief hours ago,\r\non the luxuriously appointed liner, she was everything, he was nothing.\r\nShe was the grand lady, the pampered cabin passenger; he was the\r\ndespised stoker, hardly to be counted among human beings. Suddenly what\r\nan astounding revolution! A cataclysm, and all was changed--distinctions\r\nof birth, education, and wealth were instantly abolished. Now they were\r\nmerely two helpless human beings cast away on a deserted island in the\r\nlonely mid-ocean, one dependent upon the other, one no better than the\r\nother. They had returned to primeval conditions. In what way was she his\r\nsuperior now?\r\n\r\nThus arguing to himself, he took fresh courage and drew nearer. She was\r\ncertainly pretty, there was no getting away from that, and he--was a\r\nman!\r\n\r\nLying there, pale, soaked, bedraggled, Grace looked the picture of utter\r\nmisery. Of the artificial aids to good looks which women in their\r\nvanity love to employ, not one remained, yet even with every adjunct of\r\nself-adornment gone she was still beautiful. The exuberant spirits and\r\npride of bearing were no longer there, only a sad, wistful, pallid\r\nloveliness that was even more potent in its appeal than the radiant,\r\ngay, fashionably gowned, proud beauty who had attracted his gaze when,\r\nfrom his place of concealment among the ventilators, he had gloomily\r\nwatched the brilliant scene on the promenade-deck.\r\n\r\nShe made no attempt to move. Still stunned by the awful calamity which\r\nhad so swiftly overtaken the steamer, her ears still ringing with the\r\ndespairing cries of her friends as they were swept to their deaths, her\r\nbrain was a blank. She could not think or reason. Every sense seemed\r\nparalyzed. She felt no sensations of hunger or thirst. She was surprised\r\nto find herself still alive. All she remembered was the terrible\r\nexplosion, the frenzied scramble for the boats, and then all at once she\r\nfound herself in the water, swimming, trying to keep herself afloat. How\r\nshe reached the shore she did not know. A man had caught her as she was\r\nsinking, and in a vague sort of way she thought he was one of the crew.\r\nShe wondered where she was and why her body ached so. The air chilled\r\nher bare shoulders. She shivered, moaned, and opened her eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Are you hurt?\" he asked, advancing.\r\n\r\nThis abrupt breaking of the long silence by the sound of a human voice\r\nseemed strange to her. She thought she was dreaming, and she smiled\r\nfaintly at the absurdity of it.\r\n\r\n\"Are you hurt?\" he demanded, again stooping over her.\r\n\r\nShe turned her gaze wonderingly on Armitage. In the uncertain light it\r\nwas difficult to get a good view of his face. He seemed a stranger to\r\nher. From him, her eyes wandered inquiringly round the cave.\r\n\r\n\"Where am I?\" she asked, in a low voice.\r\n\r\n\"On an island,\" he replied shortly. \"The steamer's lost. Only you and I\r\nwere saved.\"\r\n\r\nShe turned white, and her breath came and went quickly. Then she caught\r\nsight of her torn gown, and quickly she covered herself modestly, a\r\nfaint flush overspreading her pale face. She continued to stare at\r\nArmitage, as if he reminded her of some one she had seen before.\r\nPuzzled, she passed her hand over her eyes as if trying to remember.\r\n\r\n\"Who are you?\" she said finally. \"Where have I seen you before?\"\r\n\r\nHe shifted uneasily on his feet and looked away, avoiding her scrutiny.\r\nWhy should she know that he had been one of the poor devils in the\r\nstoke-hole? Perhaps she already recognized him as the deserter who was\r\nso unceremoniously dragged on board ship in New York Harbor. Gruffly he\r\nanswered:\r\n\r\n\"I was swimming. I heard you cry out. I brought you in--that's all.\"\r\n\r\n\"You were one of the crew?\"\r\n\r\nHe nodded.\r\n\r\n\"Yes--one of the crew.\"\r\n\r\n\"How can I thank you!\" she exclaimed. \"My father is rich. He will reward\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nHe laughed harshly.\r\n\r\n\"Money isn't much good here. You don't realize where we are. Every one's\r\ngone but we--all are drowned. We're as good as dead. We're a thousand\r\nmiles from the mainland--with no means of getting away and no food.\r\nThere's little chance of being sighted by a passing ship, for the storm\r\nhad blown us out of the regular steamer track.\" Brutally, he added: \"You\r\nmight as well understand the situation. Death by starvation stares us in\r\nthe face.\"\r\n\r\nGrace interrupted him by an outburst of hysterical weeping. Weakened\r\nphysically by exertion and exposure, her nerves overwrought by terror\r\nand suspense, little wonder that at last she gave way. She sobbed like a\r\nchild, a piteous passion of tears that would have melted a heart of\r\nstone. She didn't care for herself. She was ready to die. But she was\r\nsorry for Daddy and her poor mother. They would grieve for her and it\r\nwould break their hearts. She shuddered as she thought of the shocking\r\nfate which had befallen her recent companions on the ship.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps some of them got away in the boats,\" she gasped between her\r\ntears.\r\n\r\n\"Maybe they did,\" he replied, with an indifferent shrug of his\r\nshoulders. With a gesture of impatience he added curtly: \"It's no use\r\ncrying. That won't do any good. What you need most is to get out of\r\nthose wet clothes. You're soaked to the skin.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have no others to put on,\" ruefully she replied, making an effort to\r\nsit up and squeezing the water out of her skirt. She thought with dismay\r\nof all her precious belongings forever lost at the bottom of the sea.\r\nFortunately, her pearls were saved. The necklace was still round her\r\nthroat.\r\n\r\n\"Look!\" she said, holding the necklace up so he could see it. \"At least\r\nwe have these. They are worth $40,000.\"\r\n\r\nHe laughed derisively.\r\n\r\n\"They're worth nothing where there's no one to buy them,\" he growled.\r\nThen, impatiently, he said: \"Don't waste your time bothering about that.\r\nWhat you want to do is to take those clothes off right away. Then you'll\r\ndry them and put them on again. You can't remain any longer in wet\r\nclothes.\"\r\n\r\nHe spoke authoritatively, with the commanding air of one who intends to\r\nbe obeyed. She was in no mood to argue the matter. Besides, he was\r\nright. She was already chilled and ran the danger of getting pneumonia\r\nunless she dried her clothes quickly; but how could she change\r\nthem--with no fire to dry her things and with this man coming in and\r\nout? He saw her embarrassment and intuitively guessed the reason. He was\r\nstill in the shadow, but she fancied she noticed a covert smile hovering\r\nabout his mouth, and she immediately took a dislike to him, in spite of\r\nthe service he had rendered her. His manner was overbearing--almost\r\ninsolent. Again, there was something about him that reminded her of a\r\nman she had known or seen, but still she could not remember. Turning to\r\nher, he said gruffly:\r\n\r\n\"I'm fairly well soaked myself. While you're changing I'll go and take a\r\nrun along the sands and dry my clothes in the sun. Before I go I'll\r\nlight a fire for you to dry your clothes on.\"\r\n\r\nHe produced from his pocket a small box wrapped in oilskin. Opening it,\r\nhe held up three lucifer matches, and, grimly, he said:\r\n\r\n\"These are worth more to us than your pearls. See--there are only three\r\nleft, and they're as dry as when I left the ship. I'm going to light a\r\nfire just outside there, at the foot of the cliff. Once lighted, the\r\nfire must never be allowed to go out. It must burn night and day. It\r\nwill keep us warm and cook our food. I'll start the fire; you'll keep it\r\ngoing with what small pieces of wood you can gather. Do you understand?\"\r\n\r\nGrace was taken aback. For a moment she was speechless with indignation.\r\nThis man, this common sailor, was actually giving her a command, telling\r\nher to do menial work, and admonishing her to do it properly, as if she\r\nwere a domestic servant. Her first impulse was to rebel and order him\r\nangrily from her presence. On second thoughts, she said nothing. After\r\nall, he was right. She ought to be willing to do her share. They were no\r\nlonger on the ship where she had only to touch a button and a dozen\r\nmaids and stewards ran to obey her slightest whim. Although reared in\r\nluxury, and petted and indulged since her birth, she was not a fool. She\r\nwas quick to realize that conditions had changed and that their\r\nrespective social positions--hers and this sailor's--were now completely\r\nreversed. She was dependent on him, not he on her. If she were to be\r\nsaved, it would be thanks to his resourcefulness, his courage. Her money\r\nwould be of no use here. He alone could protect and save her, so why,\r\nquarrel with him. Docilely, therefore, she replied:\r\n\r\n\"Yes--I understand.\"\r\n\r\nArmitage left her alone in the cave, and, proceeding along the silvery\r\nsands, set hastily to work to gather together the scattered driftwood.\r\nThe beach was strewn for miles with the flotsam and jetsam of countless\r\ntides, an accumulation that apparently had been undisturbed for\r\ncenturies. Much of it was moldy with age and, well protected from the\r\nrains by overhanging rocks, was dry as tinder.\r\n\r\n\"This stuff'll make a bully blaze,\" he muttered cheerfully to himself.\r\n\r\nHe toiled with a will, glad of the brisk exercise to take the kinks out\r\nof his numbed limbs. The sun was now high above the horizon, and its\r\nwarm rays felt grateful after the chill of the stormy night. Directly he\r\nhad started the fire, he'd leave the girl to change her clothes and go\r\nhimself where he could take a rub-down and lay out his own things to\r\ndry. Then he'd take a run along the coast and climb the cliff to see\r\nwhat sort of a place this was they had landed on. He felt a sense of\r\nrelief that he was no longer subjected to the discipline and restraint\r\nof the ship.\r\n\r\nHe chuckled to himself as his mind dwelt on the disaster that had\r\nemancipated him. His taskmasters were no longer there to torment\r\nhim--all were drowned or gone away in the boats. Once more he was a free\r\nman. At last he could raise his head. To the others the wreck had been\r\nan overwhelming calamity! to him it meant salvation. No matter what the\r\nfuture had in store, no matter what privations he must suffer on this\r\nisland--even if he must soon perish--anything was better than the\r\ntorture he had endured in that hellish stoke-hole.\r\n\r\nIn a way, he felt sorry for the girl. Evidently she was not used to\r\nroughing it. It would be harder for her than for him. She seemed\r\ninclined to be haughty, he thought. He had noticed the proud toss of her\r\nhead when he spoke about her attending to the fire. He smiled grimly.\r\nShe didn't like that. Well, that was the fault of her bringing up. How\r\ncould a girl, raised as she'd been, be expected to do anything useful?\r\nSuch girls were only the butterflies of life--of no particular use\r\nexcept to look pretty. It wouldn't do her any harm to learn a thing or\r\ntwo. Apart from that, she seemed all right. In fact, he was not sorry\r\nshe'd been saved to share his solitude. His hour had not come to die,\r\nthat was sure; otherwise he'd have been drowned with the rest. As long\r\nas he had to be cast away on this barren islet it was as well that he\r\nhad a companion. Of course, she wouldn't be much use if it came to real\r\nhardships--procuring food, fighting off attacks of animals or reptiles,\r\nor building a boat to get away--but she was a beauty, a prize-winner, no\r\nmistake about that. Again his eyes gleamed as his mind dwelt upon what\r\nhad been revealed to him in the cave--a torn dress, a white, soft neck,\r\na soaked dress showing limbs like sculptured marble, a curved mouth,\r\ntempting enough to inflame a saint. Fast and furiously he worked,\r\nstrange thoughts crowding upon each other in his brain.\r\n\r\nSoon he had gathered a big pile of driftwood, and had it all ready for\r\nlighting. He rubbed his hands with satisfaction. They'd soon have a\r\nblaze that could be seen fifty miles out at sea. Taking from his pocket\r\nonce more the little box, he unwrapped the oilskin and took out one of\r\nthe three precious matches. Then, with infinite precautions, stooping\r\nand covering the tiny flicker with one hand to protect it from the wind,\r\nhe applied the light. Only one match was necessary. Owing to the extreme\r\ndryness of the wood, the pile caught instantly. A thick column of smoke\r\nrose to the sky, followed by a sharp crackling and long tongue of flame.\r\nMore wood and more he kept piling on until he had before him a roaring\r\nfurnace. Pleased with the quick result, he shouted to Grace, who was\r\nstill inside the cave.\r\n\r\n\"See here. You'll soon dry yourself by this fire!\"\r\n\r\nGrace appeared at the mouth of the cave. Busy tending to the fire, his\r\nback turned toward the cliff, he did not see her suddenly recoil as she\r\nperceived him, nor the expression of consternation and terror that came\r\ninto her pale, wan face. As he stood there full in the strong light of\r\nthe roaring fire, she saw the face of her rescuer distinctly for the\r\nfirst time. She saw vividly a picture she had seen once before on the\r\nill-fated ship--the handsome profile of a man bending low over a glowing\r\nfurnace, with the shoulders and muscles of a Hercules, and the head and\r\ngrace of a Greek god. Transfixed, her bosom heaving, she stood rooted to\r\nthe ground. Now she remembered! Now she knew him! He was the fireman\r\nArmitage--the terrible man of the _Atlanta_'s stoke-hole. She was alone\r\non the island--with that terrible man!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rest of that morning, Grace, to her intense relief, saw little of\r\nthe man into whose abhorrent company she had been so strangely and\r\nunceremoniously thrown. Once the fire was well started Armitage had\r\ndisappeared, leaving her in privacy to attend to her immediate needs.\r\nFor this much consideration she felt grateful to him. But, after she had\r\ndried her clothes and had time to realize her terrible situation, she\r\nwas overwhelmed by the hopeless horror of it. Her faculties well-nigh\r\nparalyzed, her nerves shattered almost to the point of total collapse,\r\nshe sank down on a rock under the frowning cliffs, and, looking\r\nhelplessly out over the vast and now peaceful sea, started to take\r\nmental stock of the extraordinary predicament in which she suddenly\r\nfound herself.\r\n\r\nThings had happened so quickly that she had no time for reflection. Bad\r\nas the situation had been before, it was ten times worse now. To think\r\nthat she should be perched on a lonely island hundreds of miles from\r\ncivilization, without any means of communicating with the outside world,\r\nalone with that man--and such a man!\r\n\r\nHer heart sank as she remembered all the dreadful things she had heard\r\nabout him on the ship. It was surely calamity enough to be shipwrecked\r\nand cast away on a stupid little island without food, shelter, or\r\nclothes, but how much more serious was the situation when the only other\r\nhuman being to be saved beside herself was the worst character on board.\r\nThe first revelation of his identity was such a shock to her nervous\r\nsystem that she nearly swooned, her brain reeled, she thought she would\r\ngo insane with terror.\r\n\r\nShe tried to calm herself. At the worst, she argued philosophically, he\r\ncould only kill her and throw her body into the sea. Not that she could\r\nlook forward to such a fate with equanimity. She gulped down a\r\nhysterical sob as she pictured her splendid form and tender young flesh\r\nproviding a toothsome meal for some rapacious shark, and she wondered if\r\nthe world--particularly her own set--would care when they read in the\r\nsensational Sunday papers all the horrible details of her dreadful end.\r\nYet why, after all, should this man--this ogre--kill her? Her pearls\r\ndidn't tempt him. Hadn't he scoffed at them just now? Then her face\r\nblanched and she dug her manicured nails deep into her skin as she\r\nthought of a worse fate than death that could overtake her. She had read\r\nand heard of such things--hadn't Professor Hanson, during their talks on\r\nshipboard, conceived this very situation?\r\n\r\nShe wondered how she could protect herself and what attitude she should\r\nadopt toward this man. An open rupture would never do; she must not even\r\nshow distrust of him. Only she must be constantly on her guard. All\r\nthese thoughts were rushing through her brain when it suddenly occurred\r\nto her that she was hungry. What was more natural? The last thing she\r\nhad eaten was the plate of ice cream brought to her during the dance by\r\nCount von Hatzfeld. Since then nothing but sea water had passed her\r\nlips.\r\n\r\nA feeling of faintness came over her, and soon her dread of Armitage\r\ngave her less anxiety than her speculations regarding the problem of\r\nprocuring food. She was desperately hungry. Perhaps if she walked along\r\nthe shore she could pick up some shell-fish--oysters, or perhaps some\r\ncrabs. She thought pensively of the delicious crab meat _a la Newburg_,\r\nserved in chafing-dish, which was one of the culinary delights of\r\nSherry's delightful little after-the-theater suppers, and, closing her\r\neyes, she gave a sigh of despair. Then, catching a glimpse of her\r\nwater-stained, tattered gown, she could not help laughing in spite of\r\nher misery. The idea of her traipsing along the sands in a decollete\r\nball-dress struck her as ludicrously incongruous. She must find\r\nsomething else to wear, but what?\r\n\r\nShe wondered where Armitage had gone and why he stayed so long away.\r\nPerhaps he would never come back. Then, surely, she would perish\r\nmiserably alone. It needed a man's strength and resourcefulness to\r\nensure an existence in such a wild, deserted spot. What could she, a\r\nfrail woman, do alone to get food and devise some way of escape?\r\nUnconsciously, she already missed her companion. Without realizing it,\r\nshe admitted his superiority in the new conditions the shipwreck had\r\nbrought about.\r\n\r\nSuddenly she heard a shout, and, turning quickly, she saw him coming\r\nalong the beach carrying something in his hands. She advanced toward\r\nhim, preserving a cold, indifferent exterior, but glad secretly that he\r\nhad returned. After all, he was a human being, some one she could talk\r\nto. Had she alone been saved, to live alone on this island, she would\r\nhave gone mad. As she watched him approach she wondered why she had not\r\nrecognized him at first. It was the same tall, splendidly proportioned\r\nfigure, the same dark, wavy hair, closely cropped, the same regular\r\nfeatures, and bold, defiant toss of the head. Yes, she saw the reason\r\nwhy. His face was clean and white now, whereas on shipboard she had\r\nnever seen it any other way than grimy and covered with coal-dust. The\r\ninvoluntary bath had effected a wonderful transformation. He was\r\ndecidedly handsome. As he came along at a quick, swinging gait she\r\nwondered why such a fine fellow should have sunk so low as to be obliged\r\nto become a common stoker.\r\n\r\n\"I have your breakfast here!\" he called out cheerily, as he came in\r\nearshot. \"I guess you're ready for it.\"\r\n\r\nShe reddened, and stammered a confused reply.\r\n\r\n\"Here's some fresh water,\" he said, as he came up to her. Holding out a\r\nhuge scallop-shell filled with water, he went on: \"You can drink it\r\nsafely. I've found a spring in the hills away yonder. It's clear as\r\ncrystal.\"\r\n\r\nGrace drank greedily, murmuring her thanks.\r\n\r\n\"It's delicious!\" she gasped between gulps.\r\n\r\nHe gave a grunt of satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\"I picked up the shell along the beach,\" he said. \"It doesn't make a bad\r\ndrinking-cup. We'll find it useful. Mind you don't lose it.\"\r\n\r\nAgain that tone of command which had irritated her before. She looked up\r\nangrily, but he was paying no attention to her. Putting his hand in his\r\npocket he brought out some mango fruit and offered it to her.\r\n\r\n\"Here's something you can break your fast with. There's plenty of it\r\ngrowing hereabouts. There are limes and cocoanuts, too, for the\r\npicking. When I get my tackle fixed, I shall be able to catch some\r\nfish.\"\r\n\r\nHe threw himself down on the sloping beach as though weary after the\r\nlong exploring tour, and, picking up a splinter of wood, he started to\r\ndraw lines on the sand.\r\n\r\nGrace, busy eating, her white teeth biting hungrily into the luscious\r\nfruit, watched him without speaking. His abrupt manner intimidated her.\r\nShe was afraid of him, and the realization of her own utter helplessness\r\nonly served to make her more nervous. Finally, summoning up courage, she\r\nasked:\r\n\r\n\"What did you see--could you make out where we are?\"\r\n\r\nHe looked up and nodded. Then, with his bit of wood, he began to draw in\r\nthe soft sand a diagram of their position. Carelessly he said:\r\n\r\n\"We're on an island about ten miles long by about three miles wide. It\r\nseems to be of volcanic origin and uninhabited. The land is low and\r\nswampy in parts, with a lot of thick brushwood, but there's a big hill\r\non which we can build a signal fire.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are our chances of being sighted and taken off?\" she interrupted\r\neagerly.\r\n\r\n\"Decidedly slim, I should say,\" was his laconic rejoinder.\r\n\r\nGrace stopped eating, and a look of dismay overspread her face. He\r\ncontinued:\r\n\r\n\"You see we're far out of the regular steamship track. Not being down on\r\nthe chart, navigators probably never heard of this island. Our only hope\r\nis in the whalers. These waters are full of whales, and whaling-vessels\r\ncome here after them from all parts of the world. Some no doubt land\r\nhere to replenish their supply of fresh water. Or a passing whaler may\r\nsight our fire.\"\r\n\r\n\"How long will we have to wait?\" she demanded anxiously.\r\n\r\nHe shrugged his shoulders as if the length of their enforced sojourn on\r\nthe island were a matter of no concern to him. Indifferently he replied:\r\n\r\n\"One can't tell. Three months--six months--a year!\"\r\n\r\n\"A year!\" gasped Grace. \"How could I live here a year, or even six\r\nmonths--I should go mad.\"\r\n\r\nHe smiled grimly.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, we get accustomed to most anything when we have to. I wasn't\r\noverfond of the job I had on the ship, but I had to knuckle down to it\r\nall the same. We don't always get things the way we want them, do we?\"\r\n\r\nShe ignored the rebuke, too much perturbed at the gloomy prospect he\r\nheld out. Nor did she notice that this was the first allusion he had\r\nmade to his work in the stoke-hold.\r\n\r\n\"Even a month would seem like a century,\" she went on almost\r\nhysterically. \"Is there no possible way of reaching the mainland?\"\r\n\r\nHe shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"The nearest land is a good eight hundred miles away. We have no\r\nboat--no compass----\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, what can we do? What can we do?\" she wailed, pacing to and fro,\r\nswinging her hands.\r\n\r\n\"Make the best of it, I should say,\" he replied coolly. There was the\r\nsuggestion of a smile hovering around his mouth, and his eyes were full\r\non her as he added: \"I'm in no particular hurry to get away myself.\"\r\n\r\nShe saw the covert smile and the boldness of his glance, and it aroused\r\nher resentment. Forgetting her caution she turned angrily on him.\r\n\r\n\"Of course, _you_ don't care. Why should you? You find there's plenty\r\nhere to eat and nothing to do. That kind of life suits you better, no\r\ndoubt, than having to earn a living by hard work. You've no friends who\r\nare mourning for you, no father or mother grieving over your supposed\r\ndeath. So long as you can enjoy creature comforts without paying for\r\nthem, you are satisfied to stay here forever. But with me it's\r\ndifferent. My life has not been like yours. You ought to realize that.\r\nWhat may seem like comfort and all that is necessary to you, is torture\r\nand starvation to me. You ought to be able to see that! You ought! You\r\nought!\"\r\n\r\nShe stopped, her face red from excitement, her bosom heaving, her voice\r\nchoking with sobs.\r\n\r\nTaken aback at the vehemence of her hysterical outburst, he simply\r\nlooked at her, admiring her flashing, dark eyes, fascinated by her\r\nbeauty. He did not care what she said, although she had spoken as a\r\nwoman might to her lackey. Her words were stinging, her tone\r\ncontemptuous. She had given him plainly to understand that she was\r\nfashioned of entirely different clay. When forced to it by circumstances\r\nshe might, when thirsty, share his cup. She might, when hungry, accept\r\npart of his food, but aside from the satisfying of these elemental human\r\ndesires, he and she had naught in common. He must understand that\r\nplainly.\r\n\r\n\"She's dead right,\" he said to himself. Socially they were separated by\r\nthe widest gulf imaginable. Even with him to attend to her wants she\r\nwould be as much alone on this island as if he were not there. A common\r\nstoker was hardly fit to breathe the same air as a girl who was heiress\r\nto millions, accustomed to all the refinements of wealth.\r\n\r\nHe looked at her for a moment in silence. His face flushed and his lips\r\nmoved as if he were about to make some angry retort. With a visible\r\neffort he mastered himself, and, turning on his heel, he walked slowly\r\naway.\r\n\r\nGrace's first impulse was to recall him. Only her pride prevented her\r\nrunning after him. Already she regretted her hasty words. She would have\r\ngiven almost anything to unsay them. She had not intended to be\r\ndiscourteous to this man. Whatever his character might be, however low\r\nhe might be in the social scale, he had rendered her a service she could\r\nnever repay. He had saved her life. Yet, thoughtlessly, needlessly, she\r\nhad hurt his feelings. What utter folly it was to boast of her social\r\nposition in her present predicament. She thought with bitterness how\r\nlittle her culture and education could help her now. Their situation was\r\nprecarious enough without making matters worse by senseless bickerings.\r\n\r\nWearily she sank down on a rock, angry with herself, apprehensive of the\r\nconsequences of her speech. She had had reason to fear him before; by\r\nher own foolishness the rupture was now definite. This new\r\nmisunderstanding would certainly add to her discomfort and perhaps\r\nlessen her chances of escaping from this worst of horrors--a living\r\ndeath!\r\n\r\nLooking out to sea, she strained her eyes in every direction in the hope\r\nof catching a glimpse of some vessel which to her would mean safety and\r\nhome. The thick black smoke from the fire Armitage had started was\r\nstill rising in a straight column to the sky. If there happened along a\r\ncraft of any description their signal could not fail to be seen. But her\r\ntired eyes swept the horizon in vain. There was not a speck on the vast\r\nexpanse of shimmering blue to give her the slightest encouragement. Her\r\nheart sank within her. All signs of the recent hurricane had\r\ndisappeared. Once more Nature was in holiday garb. The ocean reflected\r\nthe turquoise-blue of the cloudless heavens; the air, gently stirred by\r\na balmy breeze, was fragrant with the odor of spices. There was no trace\r\nof the wreck or of the missing life-boats. The ocean had completely\r\nengulfed the steamship. What the fate of the other passengers, officers,\r\nand crew had been could only be matter of conjecture.\r\n\r\n\"God grant that they got safely away,\" she murmured fervently to\r\nherself. \"Perhaps they will be picked up by some ship and then they may\r\ncome in search of me--unless they come to the conclusion that I'm dead.\r\nI might just as well be dead as here.\"\r\n\r\nShe was still ravenously hungry. The little fruit she had eaten had not\r\nsatisfied her and she did not know where to go to look for more. She\r\nwondered if she had made him so angry that he would entirely desert her\r\nand leave her to starve. With a shudder she thought of other terrors in\r\nstore for her. What about the coming night?\r\n\r\nThe afternoon was rapidly advancing; before very long the sun would set\r\nand what then? How could she face the coming darkness alone with that\r\nman whom she had angered and with all the unknown terrors the island\r\ncontained? Almost panic-stricken from sheer nervousness and anxiety,\r\nutterly discouraged and miserable, she buried her face in her hands and\r\nburst into tears.\r\n\r\nSuddenly she heard a footstep, and, looking up, she saw Armitage\r\napproaching. He was making only slow progress, being weighted down with\r\nsome heavy object.\r\n\r\n\"Here's a prize!\" he shouted, as he came nearer.\r\n\r\nStaggering up to near where she stood he set down a huge iron pot.\r\n\r\n\"I spied it lying among the drift along the shore,\" he went on. \"It's a\r\nbit rusty, but that'll scrape off. It's worth its weight in gold to us.\r\nWe've something to cook in now.\"\r\n\r\nHe spoke cheerily, with the utmost frankness. If he still nourished any\r\nresentment his manner did not betray it. In her present state of\r\ndepression Grace would have welcomed the apparition of Satan himself.\r\nShe made no attempt to conceal her joy at his return. Clapping her hands\r\nwith childish enthusiasm, she cried:\r\n\r\n\"Oh, isn't it perfectly lovely!\"\r\n\r\nAt home she had never been inside a kitchen. It is indeed doubtful if\r\nshe knew what a culinary utensil looked like. Perhaps it had never\r\noccurred to her that the kettle and many other things as humble are all\r\nindispensable parts in our civilization. But now she understood.\r\nNecessity is a quick teacher and Grace was learning. The pot was an\r\nordinary tripod affair, battered and rusty. Judging from its appearance,\r\nit had fallen overboard from some ship and had floated ashore. Otherwise\r\nit was sound and serviceable. She could see that its value to them was\r\nwell-nigh inestimable.\r\n\r\n\"That's splendid--that's bully!\" she repeated excitedly.\r\n\r\nHe enjoyed her enthusiasm. It was the first time he had seen her smile,\r\nand it looked good to him. He chuckled to himself as he said:\r\n\r\n\"But that isn't all. A pot with nothing to put in it isn't much use.\r\nI've brought you something good to eat.\"\r\n\r\nPlunging his hand into the pot he brought out half a dozen live crabs\r\nand threw them at her feet.\r\n\r\n\"Aren't they beauties?\" he exclaimed. \"I'll bet they'll taste dandy,\r\ntoo. Look out! Mind they don't nip your fingers with their claws.\r\nThey're pretty lively. They bite like the mischief.\"\r\n\r\nGrace's mouth was already watering:\r\n\r\n\"What shall I do with them?\" she asked helplessly.\r\n\r\n\"Cook 'em, of course,\" he replied, with a grin. \"You get them ready\r\nwhile I go and fetch some water.\"\r\n\r\nShe listened in consternation, not liking to tell him she did not know\r\nhow to cook. His women, of course, could work and do everything to help\r\nthemselves. They could sew and make their own dresses. She felt ashamed\r\nof her own uselessness and was about to make confession when he hurried\r\naway. As he ran he turned and called out:\r\n\r\n\"You'd better take a shell and see if you can scrape off some of that\r\nrust inside the pot.\"\r\n\r\nHe disappeared, leaving her looking in dismay, first at the iron pot and\r\nthen at the crabs, already striving to regain their liberty. She had not\r\nthe slightest idea what to do. Her only knowledge of crabs was when\r\ntheir tender, white, flakelike meat was served in chafing-dish with\r\ndelicious sherry sauce. How to accomplish the operation of transforming\r\nthose crawling, dangerous-looking things into a toothsome dish she had\r\nnot the slightest notion. Even if she did know, how could she touch the\r\nnasty things when they were raising their nippers so menacingly and\r\nalready trying to scud away in the direction of their native habitat,\r\nthe sea. The most she could do was to run after each wriggling deserter\r\nand with her foot turn him over on his back. As to the other order she\r\nhad received--that was easy. She could scrape the pot with a shell.\r\nThat was easy enough. Yet if she were busy on the pot the crabs would\r\nprofit by it to slip away, and then they would have no supper at all. It\r\nwas certainly a problem worthy of the Sphinx.\r\n\r\nShe was still trying to solve it when Armitage reappeared. In one hand\r\nhe carried a gigantic cocoanut filled to the brim with sparkling, fresh\r\nwater; with the other he was dragging along the sand a huge plant of\r\nunfamiliar aspect.\r\n\r\n\"Are you all ready?\" he called out.\r\n\r\n\"No--I'm afraid not,\" she stammered confusedly.\r\n\r\nQuick to guess the reason, he merely smiled.\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" he said pleasantly. \"I'll fix it.\"\r\n\r\nCarefully putting down the precious liquid, he seized hold of the iron\r\npot, and, with a few strokes of his sheath-knife, soon had it in\r\ncondition and on the fire. Over such fierce heat, the water did not take\r\nlong to boil, and a few minutes later the obstreperous crustaceans were\r\non the way to discharge their natural debt to two starving humans.\r\n\r\n\"What a feast we'll have!\" exclaimed Grace, as she eagerly watched his\r\npreparations. \"If only we had some bread to go with them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here's something just as good,\" he replied quickly. Stooping down\r\ntoward the plant he had just brought in he plucked some of the\r\nfruit--long, yellow pods with red speckles--and held them out to her.\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" she asked, in surprise. \"I never saw fruit like that\r\nbefore.\"\r\n\r\n\"They are plantains--the potatoes of the tropics,\" he answered.\r\n\r\n\"They look like bananas,\" said Grace, starting to peel and eat one.\r\n\r\n\"Same family,\" he explained. As if surprised at her ignorance, he went\r\non: \"It is a wonderful fruit. It's meat, potatoes, and bread all in one.\r\nIts fiber one can use as thread, and its enormous leaves make warm\r\nclothing. When the fruit is powdered and baked you would hardly know it\r\nfrom rice. Speke, Stanley, and the other African explorers frequently\r\nmention plantains as the staple food of the natives. We're fortunate to\r\nfind it here, and there seems to be an abundance.\"\r\n\r\nGrace looked at him curiously. She was not aware that seamen were so\r\nwell versed.\r\n\r\n\"What do you know about African explorers?\" she demanded.\r\n\r\nHer question seemed to amuse him, for he showed his teeth in a smile.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I've read their books,\" he replied. \"We sailormen pick up a good\r\ndeal of information knocking about the world as we do.\"\r\n\r\nShe would have liked to question him further, curious to learn something\r\nof his history, but there was an air of reserve about him that gave her\r\nlittle encouragement. On reflection she thought it unwise to appear\r\ninterested. He might misconstrue her motive. She had not forgotten the\r\nbad reputation he had borne on the steamer, and while there had been\r\nnothing in his behavior so far to give her cause for alarm, she must not\r\nforget that she was entirely alone on this island with a man of the\r\nlower classes, a man unaccustomed, probably, to self-control. She must\r\ndiscourage all familiarity, and never for a moment permit him to forget\r\nthe broad social gulf which separated them. With these anxieties running\r\nthrough her mind she relapsed into silence. He seemed to notice the\r\nsudden change in her manner, for he looked up from the fire and said:\r\n\r\n\"I'll soon have it ready. Suppose you get two big, flat shells for\r\nplates. We'll have to use our fingers for forks.\"\r\n\r\nAs she went to carry out his suggestion, she said apologetically:\r\n\r\n\"You think of everything. I wish I could be of more assistance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense!\" he answered. \"Why was I saved from the wreck if not to look\r\nafter you?\"\r\n\r\nShe did not like this speech, savoring as it did of clumsy gallantry, so\r\nshe made no rejoinder. By the time she had found the kind of shells\r\nsuitable for plates, the crabs were cooked to a turn, and they\r\nimmediately sat down in semi-reclining position to enjoy them.\r\n\r\nIt was a veritable feast of Lucullus served picnic-fashion in mid-ocean.\r\nTo Grace it seemed that in all her life she had never tasted anything so\r\ndelicious. The crabs were tender and sweet-flavored, and the plantains\r\nprovided her with a new taste which improved on acquaintance. In spite\r\nof their thus sharing a common meal there was a certain restraint. Each\r\nseemed to be uncertain of and mistrust the other. They ate quickly and\r\nin silence, each preoccupied, Grace becoming more and more nervous as\r\nthe shadows about her deepened, Armitage, silent, in admiring\r\ncontemplation of his companion's shapely hands, her full bust and white\r\nneck, her beautiful eyes which, when they looked full into his, caused\r\nevery nerve in his body to thrill.\r\n\r\nBy the time they had eaten the last scrap, the evening was well\r\nadvanced. The sun had dipped below the watery horizon long ago, and it\r\nwas getting dark very rapidly. Grace's growing nervousness became more\r\nand more apparent. He noticed it and suddenly broke the silence.\r\n\r\n\"Where will you sleep to-night?\" he asked. \"You're worn out after all\r\nyou've gone through.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--I am very tired,\" she replied.\r\n\r\nHe rose, and, after throwing more wood on to the fire, he turned to her.\r\n\r\n\"I'll have to fix you up a bed in the cave the best way I can. I can get\r\nfern-leaves and long, cypress-haired moss in the woods. That'll make\r\ncapital stuffing, and with a few plantain-leaves you'll have a mattress\r\nfit for a queen. It'll do for to-night. To-morrow we'll make you more\r\ncomfortable.\"\r\n\r\nBefore she could murmur her gratitude he had hurried away in the\r\ndirection of the woods.\r\n\r\nLeft alone, her nervousness increased. She wondered what he would do for\r\na bed, if he would insist on sharing the shelter of the cave with her,\r\nor if he would prefer to sleep outside under the stars. She felt\r\nsingularly apprehensive. A panicky feeling seized her. How could she\r\nspend all the lonely hours of the night in the terrifying\r\ndarkness--alone with that man? She felt nervous and uneasy, as if some\r\nnew peril threatened her. Certainly, she would not be able to close an\r\neye. A night of mental torture was before her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n\r\nSoon Armitage returned, his arms filled with a great load of fern-leaves\r\nand grass.\r\n\r\nGrace followed him into the gloomy cave, the interior of which was now\r\nquite dark. Laying his burden down, he prepared to arrange her couch.\r\n\r\n\"How would you like to lie?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"I think I would prefer to lie in the open,\" she replied, with a little,\r\nnervous shudder.\r\n\r\nHe shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"No--you'd better sleep in there,\" he said. \"It may rain. Besides, we\r\ndon't know what may be roaming round here during the night. In there\r\nyou'll be protected on all three sides, and, as to the entrance, I'll\r\nthrow a few big branches across. Nothing can get past without you\r\nknowing it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And where will you be?\" she inquired timidly.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I'll throw myself down by the fire. I'm accustomed to roughing\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nThe bed was swiftly made, soft and springy. All it lacked were pillow\r\nand covering.\r\n\r\n\"Take my advice and don't sleep in your clothes,\" he said. \"You can't\r\nsleep properly unless you do, and you'll need all your strength. There's\r\nno one to disturb you. You can use your dress for a pillow and your\r\nmantle for a sheet. Don't be nervous. I'll be on hand if you want me.\r\nGood night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good night!\" she echoed faintly.\r\n\r\nHe went out and she was alone. It was now quite dark outside. The night\r\nwas clear, and the heavens were studded with their countless stars. The\r\nonly light which entered the cave enabling her to grope her way about\r\nwas a ghostly flicker from the distant fire.\r\n\r\nShe tried the bed. It was fairly comfortable. Utterly exhausted, she\r\nthought she ought to sleep until daylight. She surely would if only she\r\ncould calm her nerves and allay this persistent premonition of impending\r\nperil. After all, she thought, it was foolish to be afraid. So far he\r\nhad been thoughtful and respectful, and given her no cause for alarm,\r\nand as to wild animals, they couldn't get at her if the entrance were\r\nclosed. Should she disrobe entirely or remain fully dressed to be ready\r\nfor any emergency? Certainly she would be more comfortable undressed.\r\nBesides, it was the only way in which she could get a pillow and\r\ncovering.\r\n\r\nAt that moment a heavy thud just outside made her heart leap to her\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\n\"Who's there?\" she cried out.\r\n\r\n\"It's only me,\" answered Armitage. \"I'm fixing the door of your hotel. I\r\nguess nothing can get in now. Good night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good night!\" she replied faintly.\r\n\r\nShe listened to his footsteps as they died away in the distance, and\r\nslowly began to disrobe.\r\n\r\nShe was soon undressed and was about to get into bed and cover herself\r\nup when a thought occurred to her. There was something still to be done.\r\nDropping on her knees, her bare feet on the cold sand, she buried her\r\nface in her hands and for the first time in her life offered up a\r\nfervent prayer to the unknown, Almighty Power that directs all things.\r\nGrace had never been a devout girl. She had no decided metaphysical\r\nviews of any kind. She was merely indifferent. Given up solely to a life\r\nof pleasure, religion to her had been only a word. Her parents had a\r\npew at St. Thomas', on Fifth Avenue, and when she had a new hat or a new\r\ngown to show off, she attended the services in the same spirit that she\r\nwould go to the horse show or any other fashionable function. Never\r\nuntil now had she felt the need of that moral support and encouragement\r\nwhich never fails to bring comfort to the faithful in their hour of\r\ntrouble. She prayed earnestly to be saved from her present desperate\r\nsituation, for protection during the coming night, and she prayed also\r\nfor her late ship companions who at that moment might be suffering in\r\nthe open boats. This done, her mind felt easier, and, covering herself\r\nas well as she could, she closed her eyes and courted sleep.\r\n\r\nHappily the night was warm, otherwise her scant covering, consisting\r\nsolely of a thin mantle, would not have sufficed. Everything outside was\r\nperfectly still. The lazy splash of the surf and the gentle murmur of\r\nthe breeze were the only sounds that reached her ears. Not hearing\r\nArmitage moving about she concluded that he had rolled himself up near\r\nthe fire and gone to sleep.\r\n\r\nShe closed her eyes, and, lulled into drowsiness by the distant music of\r\nthe sea, she gradually sank into the delicious semi-conscious state that\r\njust precedes slumber. Through her tired brain passed confused mental\r\npictures of the extraordinary happenings of the last forty-eight\r\nhours--the dance on the deck, the sudden storm, the shock as the great\r\nliner struck the sunken reef, the rush for the life-boats, her fall into\r\nthe water and the long swim until she came to herself on this island and\r\nrecognized the refractory stoker, Armitage, as her rescuer. She wondered\r\nif he was really as black as he had been painted. If he was, she had\r\nseen nothing of his bad qualities. He was only a stoker--a superior one\r\nto be sure, from his conversation and knowledge of things--and so far he\r\nhad behaved like a gentleman.\r\n\r\nShe wondered what she would do if suddenly he forced his way in now and\r\nattacked her. Would she scream, or faint, or do any of the hysterical\r\nthings a woman is supposed to do in such circumstances? Her mind dwelt\r\nupon his personal appearance. She recalled how handsome, and graceful,\r\nand strong he looked as he came along the beach at a swinging gait,\r\nbringing to her that greatly needed breakfast, which she had devoured\r\nwith such appetite. From him, her thoughts traveled homeward. She saw\r\nher poor mother and father grieving for her, and her supposed loss the\r\nsensation of the hour in their immediate circle of friends. Then her\r\nthoughts grew mixed and confused. Her breathing grew more regular, her\r\nbosom rose and fell with rhythmic motion, her brain ceased thinking. She\r\nwas asleep.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe long hours of the night passed slowly. Her slumber had been as\r\npeaceful and profound as that of a child when, about three o'clock, she\r\nsuddenly awoke with a start. At first she believed she was still in her\r\nluxurious stateroom on board the _Atlanta_, but the rough couch, the\r\nprickly points of which punctured her thin garment, and the splash of\r\nthe surf outside rudely reminded her of her misfortune.\r\n\r\nShe wondered what had interrupted her sleep. It was still pitch-dark and\r\neverything was quiet, yet she was wide-awake with every sense and nerve\r\nalert and tense. Like most persons who awake suddenly in the middle of\r\nthe night without being able to explain the cause, she was at once\r\nseized with nervous dread. Something was wrong.\r\n\r\nHastily, fearfully she glanced around, but her eyes were unable to\r\npenetrate the opaque darkness that surrounded her. The faint light that\r\ncame from the cave entrance only served to make the shadows deeper. She\r\nstrained her ears, but heard no sound. Yet she could not shake off the\r\nterrifying suggestion that _some one_ or _something_ had entered the\r\ncave while she was asleep and now stood in the shadows watching her,\r\nperhaps waiting for an opportunity to attack her.\r\n\r\nThe more she thought of the possibility of such a thing, the more\r\nalarmed she became, and her nervousness increased each minute until she\r\nwas bathed in perspiration from head to foot. She tried to reason with\r\nherself, to shake off the impression, and with an exclamation of\r\nimpatience at her own childishness she turned over and again closed her\r\neyes. But as she moved _It_ moved also. Her alert ear caught the sound\r\nof a slow and cautious movement, as if _some one_ or _something_ were\r\ncreeping on all fours toward her. Petrified with fright, her heart in\r\nher mouth, she called out:\r\n\r\n\"Who's there?\"\r\n\r\nThere was no answer, but the sound ceased.\r\n\r\nSomething was there, that was certain. At any moment it might spring\r\nupon her. She shook with terror, her teeth chattered. She dare not make\r\na movement. Her ears were strained for sounds of further moves. Almost\r\nrigid with fright, each passing moment seemed a century. If only she\r\ncould flee from there and reach the open. She was sorry now that\r\nArmitage had left her alone. What would she not give to be able to call\r\nhim now to her aid!\r\n\r\nSuddenly the bed moved as though _something_ had accidentally stumbled\r\nagainst it. She distinctly heard a rustling sound as if _something_ had\r\ngrazed the branches of which her couch was built. The _Thing_, whatever\r\nit was, man or beast, was close to her. The suspense was more than she\r\ncould bear. Almost swooning from terror she sprang up, and, leaning over\r\nthe side, peered into the darkness. What she beheld made the blood\r\nfreeze in her veins.\r\n\r\nA long, slimy-looking, sinuous thing, almost as thick as a man's arm\r\nand nearly six feet in length, was gliding slowly and aimlessly about in\r\nthe shadow. In the faint glimmer of light that struggled in from the\r\nentrance to the cave was plainly discernible a pair of glistening eyes\r\nset in a squat, flat head, and a cruel mouth with fanglike teeth in\r\nwhich a forked tongue darted rapidly back and forth. It was a huge\r\nhooded cobra, the deadliest of all the venomous serpents inhabiting\r\ntropical Asia.\r\n\r\nPanic-stricken, Grace opened her mouth to scream, but no sound issued\r\nforth. She tried to flee, but some irresistible power held her rooted to\r\nthe spot. Every faculty, every muscle in her was paralyzed by\r\nunspeakable horror.\r\n\r\nWith eyes dilated with terror, with every nerve tense to the\r\nsnapping-point, she watched with fearful fascination that hideous, slimy\r\nhead as with slow, rhythmic motion it swayed from side to side, the\r\nforked tongue darting from the horrid mouth as lightning rends the\r\nskies. Staring straight into the cruel, beady eyes, her fixed gaze\r\nseemed riveted there against her will, as if the reptile had cast over\r\nher a hypnotic spell. She felt herself gradually growing numb, cold\r\nsweat burst from every pore, her flesh crept, and there was a tingling\r\nsensation at the roots of her hair.\r\n\r\nEach instant she expected that the cobra would dart forward and strike\r\nher. The suspense was fearful. The seconds seemed like centuries. She\r\nwondered when the fatal moment would come that would mean her death.\r\nCertainly, all was over with her now. The storm, the shipwreck--that was\r\nnothing. This new peril, a thousand times more deadly than those she had\r\nemerged from safely, was momentarily coming nearer, and she was\r\npowerless to avert it. She must be resigned to perish miserably and\r\ncruelly the most shocking of deaths. Escape was out of the question.\r\nCoiled up in threatening attitude at the foot of the bed the reptile was\r\nbetween her and safety. If she attempted to run she would never reach\r\nthe open.\r\n\r\nThat the cobra was conscious of her presence and was preparing to attack\r\nthere could be no doubt. It showed its irritation in the manner usual to\r\nits species, by dilating its neck until it formed the shape of a broad\r\nhood. Evidently the reptile made its home in one of the dark recesses\r\nof the cave. Asleep, it had awakened during the night, and its keen\r\nsense of smell attracted by the unusual odor of a warm human body, it\r\nhad crawled to where she lay and now was ready to claim its prey. The\r\nslightest move on her part and it would dart forward. A lightninglike\r\nthrust forward of that loathsome head, then the powerful, scaly coils\r\nwould close around her, there would be the ghastly sound of bones being\r\ncrunched, and all would be over. Armitage would come in only to find her\r\nmangled and partially devoured body, perhaps himself to meet with a\r\nsimilar fate.\r\n\r\nAgain she opened her mouth to scream and warn him. Her tongue clove,\r\nspeechless, to her dry palate. A feeling of nausea came over her, her\r\ntemples were throbbing, her heart seemed to have stopped beating. She\r\nwondered if she had gone mad.\r\n\r\nShe was noting the curious, spectacle-like markings on the back of the\r\nreptile's hood when suddenly the cobra started to hiss loudly as slowly\r\nit began to move nearer to its trembling victim. Coil after coil of its\r\nglistening, sinuous body followed the hideous head as the creature\r\ndragged itself along. As it glided its sinister way over the sand the\r\ncruel, beady eyes for a brief instant were averted from the girl.\r\nInstantly the hypnotic spell which had held her transfixed was broken.\r\nUttering a piercing scream, she sprang from the bed and took refuge on\r\nthe far side of the cave. The cobra, enraged at her attempt to escape,\r\nhissed more loudly, and, accelerating its movements, moved rapidly in\r\nher direction.\r\n\r\nFlattened up against the wall of the cave Grace's lips parted in a last,\r\ndespairing prayer. She could retreat no farther. Solid rock barred the\r\nway, and escape to the open was cut off. She had not improved her\r\nposition. By seeking to evade her doom, the agony was only drawn out the\r\nlonger. The cobra was now only a dozen feet away. Coiling upon itself\r\nwithin striking distance it suddenly drew back its head, then, with\r\nlightning speed, shot it forward.\r\n\r\nQuick as the movement was, Grace was quicker. Her instinct of\r\nself-preservation enabled her to foretell the instant the creature would\r\nspring, and the energy of despair gave her strength. Giving another\r\nshout for help, she nimbly jumped aside just in time to avoid the blow.\r\nHissing furiously with baffled rage the serpent resumed the attack. Dawn\r\nwas slowly breaking, and in the dim light she could see the creature's\r\ncruel eyes scintillating as they turned to look for her.\r\n\r\nBreathless, panting from the unusual exertion, in a state of complete\r\nnervous collapse, Grace was in no condition to continue the unequal\r\ncombat. She realized that her strength was fast ebbing. It was only a\r\nquestion of seconds now when she must succumb. As those horrid, beady\r\neyes met hers, again she was seized with that strange sense of limpness,\r\nutter inability to move a muscle. Again she was under the hypnotic\r\nspell. She realized that death in its most fearful form was there before\r\nher, claiming her. She felt sick and faint. Staggering as she clutched\r\nthe cold, rocky wall of her living prison, she gave another despairing\r\nscream like a wail of human agony.\r\n\r\nScarcely conscious, she saw through her half-closed eyes the cobra\r\ngliding nearer, she could almost feel the reptile's fetid breath upon\r\nher cheek. With hopeless horror she saw it approach closer and closer,\r\nthen stop and again coil itself ready for the final spring. She\r\nshuddered, and, closing her eyes, waited for the end. There was a\r\nstrange buzzing in her ears. Suddenly everything grew dark. The cobra\r\nbegan hissing more furiously. There was a loud crash and she knew no\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nWhen again she opened her eyes, she was lying on the bed and Armitage\r\nwas kneeling by her side, bathing her face with water. Surprised to find\r\nherself still alive, she looked at him, the look of terror still in her\r\nface. Fearfully she whispered:\r\n\r\n\"Where is it? Did you see it?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's all right,\" he said cheerily, trying to quiet her. \"It won't\r\ntrouble you any more.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was it only a nightmare?\" she murmured.\r\n\r\n\"Nightmare--no,\" he answered. \"It was real enough. Look!\"\r\n\r\nHe pointed to a few paces away where lay the cobra, dead, its head\r\ncrushed in by an enormous stone.\r\n\r\n\"I heard you scream,\" he explained. \"I was asleep. It woke me. At first\r\nI thought I was dreaming. Then came another scream. I ran here and saw\r\nyou against the wall yonder and the serpent preparing to spring. I\r\npicked up a stone and killed him. I was just in time, a second later and\r\nit would have been too late.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank God!\" she said.\r\n\r\nThen she fainted again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was some time before Grace had recovered sufficiently from the\r\nnervous shock of her terrifying encounter with the cobra to be able to\r\nget about, and during this period of enforced idleness she was compelled\r\nto depend altogether on Armitage. He supplied her with the necessaries\r\nand, as well as he was able, administered to her comfort.\r\n\r\nGrateful to him for his attentions, it was not long before her feeling\r\nof obligation changed into real regard for the man. The dread in which\r\nshe at first held him had completely disappeared, as was only natural\r\nafter the services he had rendered her. Twice she owed him her life.\r\nThat alone was a debt she could never repay. Moreover, he was thoughtful\r\nand courteous, and, so far, at least, had shown no disposition to take\r\nadvantage of her helpless situation. How much worse her position would\r\nbe if he were not there at all!\r\n\r\nBut she was too much worried and preoccupied with her own troubles to\r\ngive her strange companion much thought. She watched him at work, and\r\nshe ate listlessly the food he brought her, but that was about all the\r\ninterest she took in anything.\r\n\r\nHer one burning desire was to get away. During all her waking hours her\r\nthoughts turned only in one direction: how to escape as speedily as\r\npossible from this wretched island. As the days went by and no vessel\r\nappeared, she began to wonder if they would ever be rescued, or if she\r\nwas doomed to remain on that remote islet for the rest of her days\r\nunable to communicate with her father and mother and friends, who, in\r\nignorance of her fate, had long since given her up as dead. Perhaps in\r\nyears to come some ship touching at the island in search of water would\r\nfind, strewed along the beach, her bleached bones and his--picked clean\r\nby the vultures. She wept bitterly as she thought of it; her face was\r\nbathed in tears of compassion over her misfortune. She was ashamed to\r\nlet Armitage see that she had been crying, but all day she brooded over\r\nher sorrow, and at night she dreamed that he was building a boat stout\r\nenough to convey them to the mainland.\r\n\r\nFearful that she would lose all notion of time, she started to count the\r\ndays, keeping a rough kind of calender by scratching notches at regular\r\nintervals on a shell. She notched off the days one by one, her spirits\r\nsinking in proportion as their number increased. In her despair she\r\nappealed to her companion to reassure her. But Armitage shook his head\r\ndubiously. He had little comfort to offer.\r\n\r\n\"We must be patient,\" he said grimly. \"We're here scarcely a week. Think\r\nof those shipwrecked sailors who have been marooned on desert islands\r\nfor months, even years, often with almost nothing to eat. When finally\r\nthey were rescued they were not recognizable as men. Their clothes hung\r\nupon them in shreds, their hair was matted and over-grown, they had\r\nforgotten how to talk, they tore the meat given them with their fingers\r\nlike famished wolves. We have not so much to complain of. We have plenty\r\nof water, enough to eat. It's no use fretting. We must wait patiently.\r\nPerhaps we won't have to wait long. Any day our signal-fire may be\r\nsighted by a vessel.\"\r\n\r\nThey now kept two fires going, one close at hand for their own use, and\r\nanother much bigger on top of the hill for signaling purposes. The\r\nhill-top commanded a superb view of every part of the island, and,\r\nviewed from the ocean, it must have been a conspicuous mark for miles.\r\nThey christened it Mount Hope, for on it Grace centered all her fervent\r\nprayers for rescue. It became her Mecca, and each day she made the long\r\nand exhausting climb up its precipitous slope in the expectation of\r\nseeing steamer smoke or a sail on the distant horizon. But\r\ndisappointment always awaited her. There was nothing in every direction\r\nbut dreary, monotonous wastes of heaving water, the boisterous waves\r\ndancing in the sunlight as if to mock her misery.\r\n\r\nThe care of keeping this signal-fire going devolved on Armitage, and it\r\nwas the day's most important task. The fire was kept banked with damped\r\nmoss and peat in the daytime, so it would throw off a smoke thick enough\r\nto be visible miles away at sea. At night it was made to blaze furiously\r\nwith the same object in view.\r\n\r\nThe cave had been deserted long ago. The day following her horrible\r\nexperience with the serpent, Grace protested hysterically that nothing\r\ncould induce her to enter the gloomy place again. Sleeping in it, she\r\ndeclared, was utterly out of the question. The cobra was dead, but there\r\nwas no telling what other reptile as venomous and deadly might again\r\ncrawl out of the cave's countless holes and recesses. Armitage admitted\r\nthe possibility, and at once offered to build a cabin for her in the\r\nopen. It would be far more healthy and comfortable.\r\n\r\nShe gladly consented, and he went to work with a will. He had no tools,\r\nand his construction materials were necessarily of the most primitive\r\ncharacter. Happily, the weather continued fine, and, while her new home\r\nwas in the building, Grace managed as best she could under a temporary\r\nshelter.\r\n\r\nSelecting a site that was high and dry, Armitage first dug a square hole\r\nin the ground three feet deep by about fourteen feet in length and\r\nbreadth. Each side of the excavation he lined with stone walls made of\r\nhuge boulders piled one on top of another, and decreasing in weight and\r\nsize until they reached a height all round of nearly nine feet. The\r\ninterstices he filled with clay to keep out the wind and rain, and\r\nadditional strength was secured for the walls by banking up earth on all\r\nfour exterior sides. It was a herculean task, for each of the big, heavy\r\nstones had to be dragged a considerable distance, and the only implement\r\nhe had to dig with was a crude spade which he made out of a piece of\r\nplaned wood found among the drift along the shore and sharpened and\r\nhardened in fire. Light entered through a door and window, and then came\r\nthe roof. This he made with heavy limbs of trees equally matched, which\r\nrested on top of the stone walls, these in turn being crossed with\r\nsmaller branches, and the whole covered with a thick thatch of\r\ntussac-grass and moss held in place by heavy stones. The floor inside\r\nwas strewn with tussac-grass to keep the feet dry from the damp earth.\r\nThere was also a fireplace for logs, with a flue and chimney to carry\r\noff the smoke, and before it was ready for occupancy he started a fire,\r\nthus driving out the damp and making it dry and inhabitable.\r\n\r\nHe toiled unceasingly and tirelessly, whistling cheerfully as he worked.\r\nAs Grace watched him, the thought was impressed upon her more strongly\r\nthan ever that this man was far happier here amid primeval conditions,\r\nthrown upon his own resources, than he had been in a so-called civilized\r\nstate. Evidently he had no keen desire to be rescued. The thought filled\r\nher again with dismay. Not that it would really make any material\r\ndifference. If succor were coming, they would be rescued whether her\r\nmysterious companion wished it or not. But that any human being could be\r\nreconciled to spending the remainder of his days on a barren islet in a\r\nremote part of the ocean, without clothes, tools, books, or even the\r\nbare necessaries of life, was intolerable. A man who could entertain\r\nsuch an idea for a moment could have instincts little superior to a\r\nsavage.\r\n\r\nOften she had watched her strange, moody companion as he worked and\r\nwondered what his history was. He was no ordinary seaman--that was\r\nevident from his speech and manner. He had certainly known better days.\r\nHe never spoke of himself, and when tactfully she broached the subject,\r\nhe abruptly changed the conversation. One day she said to him:\r\n\r\n\"You weren't always a stoker, were you--you weren't born to that kind of\r\nlife?\"\r\n\r\nHe stopped in his work, and for a moment looked at her in silence, as if\r\nseeking time to frame his answer. Then laconically he said:\r\n\r\n\"My past life is dead. I live only in the present. Just what I seem I\r\nam.\"\r\n\r\nStill unconvinced, she returned to the attack.\r\n\r\n\"Why did you desert from the steamer in New York?\"\r\n\r\nHe clenched his fist as thus brutally she revived the memory of his past\r\nsuffering, and in a low tone, which came almost like a hiss from between\r\nhis set teeth, he said:\r\n\r\n\"Because I could not stand it any longer--I just couldn't. I was\r\ndesperate.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why did you take to such dreadful work?\" she persisted. \"Was there\r\nnothing else more congenial, less brutalizing that you could do?\"\r\n\r\nHe shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"No--nothing. There was nothing else.\" Bitterly he added: \"The poor must\r\nslave so that the rich may enjoy.\"\r\n\r\nPuzzled, she asked:\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's no use going into particulars,\" he replied, almost contemptuously.\r\n\"You wouldn't understand.\"\r\n\r\nTurning on his heel, he resumed his work on the cabin.\r\n\r\nGrace did understand. She understood that there was something in the\r\npast life of this man which he did not wish to divulge. She felt that he\r\nhad suffered, and she was sorry for him. Again she tried to draw him\r\nout, but skilfully he parried her questions, and appeared to resent\r\nthem. Noticing this, she desisted. His past, as far as she was\r\nconcerned, at any rate, was and must remain a sealed book.\r\n\r\nBut Grace did not remain silent for all that. She was too much of a\r\nwoman to permit of that. Seeing that she could get nothing from him, she\r\ntalked about herself. She chattered about her home in New York, about\r\nher friends, about the things which interested her and the things which\r\nbored her. He listened as he worked, apparently interested, and when she\r\nsaid that she despised the empty and frivolous amusements of her set and\r\nwas ambitious to do something more worthy in life, he nodded\r\napprovingly. When she had told him everything, once more she attempted\r\nto question him in turn, but he relapsed into an obstinate silence.\r\n\r\nAfter a week's continuous toil the cabin was completed. As a finishing\r\ntouch, he made some furniture for it--a crude table and two three-legged\r\nstools. When he had put the bed in place the hut was ready for\r\noccupancy. When at last everything was ready, he called out to Grace to\r\ncome and inspect her new home.\r\n\r\n\"You'll be comfortable in here,\" he said cheerily. \"At least there are\r\nno snakes. I can promise you that.\"\r\n\r\nHe waited for her to say something, expecting that she would be pleased.\r\n\r\n\"It's very nice,\" she said hesitatingly. \"Only----\"\r\n\r\n\"Only what?\" he demanded in a tone of disappointment.\r\n\r\n\"It's too bad to have taken so much pains for so short a time,\" she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nHe laughed carelessly.\r\n\r\n\"So short a time?\" he echoed. Almost mockingly he asked: \"Do you expect\r\nto leave here so soon?\"\r\n\r\n\"As soon as I can--you may depend upon that!\" she replied determinedly,\r\nalmost ready to cry.\r\n\r\nHis indifference angered her. She thought it brutal when he knew how\r\nunhappy and miserable she was and how anxious to get back to her family.\r\nAt that moment she hated him.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, that's just it!\" he exclaimed, with a gesture of impatience. \"As\r\nsoon as you can! But you can't! We're prisoners here--in prison just as\r\nsecurely as though we were behind iron bars. We can't get away.\"\r\n\r\n\"But we'll get away some time, won't we?\" she gasped.\r\n\r\nHe shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"The chances are slim,\" he replied grimly.\r\n\r\n\"Then what good is our signal-fire?\" she persisted.\r\n\r\n\"Not much good,\" he admitted frankly.\r\n\r\nHer heart sank. Her face paled, and her lips trembled as she asked:\r\n\r\n\"Don't you think it'll be seen sooner or later? Ships must pass by here\r\nsome time.\"\r\n\r\nHe shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"Even if they do, they may not see the fire. If a ship passes near this\r\nisland it would be a great distance away. It would never occur to them\r\nto look here for signals. Besides, very few vessels do pass. A ship may\r\nnot sight our signal for a year, maybe five years, perhaps never. You\r\nremember Alexander Selkirk--Robinson Crusoe. He was twenty-eight years\r\non Tobago island--in complete solitude.\"\r\n\r\nGrace gave a low moan of distress.\r\n\r\n\"At least,\" he went on, after some hesitation, \"we have each other.\"\r\n\r\nThis remark angered her. She thought it impertinent. The boldness of his\r\nveiled insinuation was more than she could bear. He actually\r\ncontemplated the possibility of a permanent stay.\r\n\r\n\"I couldn't stand it,\" she cried hoarsely, her eyes filled with scalding\r\ntears. \"I would rather kill my self.\"\r\n\r\nHe shrugged his shoulders, and that made her all the more angry.\r\n\r\n\"You don't care,\" she went on. \"You're willing to sacrifice me because\r\nyou prefer this kind of existence to the wretched life you've had.\"\r\n\r\nThis speech aroused him to action. All his life he had suffered from\r\ninjustice. This girl, he thought, was like all the others. For a moment,\r\nhe lost his sang-froid.\r\n\r\n\"You're unjust!\" he replied hotly. \"I'm doing all I can. Who built the\r\nsignal-fire on Mount Hope? I did. Who keeps it going night and day? I\r\ndo. It's no fun climbing up that steep hill collecting fresh fuel, but I\r\ndo it. Even in my sleep sometimes I wake up in fright, thinking I may\r\nhave neglected to throw on enough fuel, fearful that the fire will go\r\nout--my last match gone. I work myself into a cold sweat thinking of it.\r\nI can't sleep. At last I am unable to stand it any longer. I get up and\r\nrush to the hill-top, all for nothing. The signal-fire is still burning\r\nbrightly. All that time you are sleeping peacefully. Does that look as\r\nif I didn't care?\"\r\n\r\n\"Forgive me,\" she murmured between her tears. \"I'm peevish and\r\nunreasonable. Forgive me. I'm so unhappy!\"\r\n\r\nHe smiled sympathetically.\r\n\r\n\"Don't get discouraged,\" he said kindly. \"As long as we're here, it's\r\nbest to get along as well as we can. It's no use fretting. If help is\r\ncoming it will come. You'll not mend matters by worrying.\"\r\n\r\nShe felt he was right. What use were her tears and her irritation? He\r\nwas doing all he could. They were in the hands of an inscrutable\r\nProvidence. As long as the signal-fire was kept burning there was hope.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nSlowly the weeks slipped by. The castaways were still in their island\r\nprison with relief as far away, apparently, as ever.\r\n\r\nGrace had taken possession of her cabin and made herself as comfortable\r\nas it was possible under the circumstances. The luxuries to which she\r\nhad always been accustomed were lamentably lacking. There was no dainty\r\nbathroom for her ablutions, no maid to answer her call, no extensive\r\nwardrobe to select from, no telephone through which she could chat with\r\nfriends. But at least she had shelter and a bed to sleep upon, and for\r\nthese blessings she was sensible enough to be devoutly thankful.\r\nArmitage had built close by, for his own use, a similar, but less\r\nelaborate, hut, and he took a certain pride in keeping it in order.\r\n\r\nOne day Grace found some flowers on the table in her cabin. Only one\r\nperson could have put them there, and when she realized that fact, it\r\ncame rather as a shock to find her strange companion paying her\r\nattentions of this nature.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you for the flowers,\" she said, with some embarrassment.\r\n\r\n\"I thought they'd brighten the place up a bit,\" he replied awkwardly:\r\n\r\nHe smiled, and she noticed for the first time that he had fine white\r\nteeth. But nothing more was said, and he went unconcernedly about his\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nFor the remainder of that morning she avoided him. She left her cabin\r\nand fled to Mount Hope, straining her eyes once more in a fruitless\r\neffort to see appear on the horizon the ship which would come to her\r\nrescue.\r\n\r\nMonotonous and lonely as was their existence on this remote islet, there\r\nwas plenty of work to be done, and the hours sometimes sped by so\r\nquickly that both Grace and Armitage were astonished. The shadows of\r\nnight would fall when they had thought it only a little past noon; Each\r\ndid a share of the day's work, glad of the occupation that helped to\r\ndivert the mind.\r\n\r\nThe signal-fire on Mount Hope demanded most of Armitage's attention;\r\nWhen not engaged in gathering fuel, he went on long foraging\r\nexpeditions. The problem of procuring food was no light one, and, like\r\nother shipwrecked sailors, who have had to exercise their wits, he was\r\nquick to devise ways to keep their larder supplied. He caught fish with\r\na hook made out of a sharp-pointed stick hardened in flame; he killed\r\nsea-gulls with stones hurled from a sling; he overturned turtles while\r\nthey lay basking in the sun, and he saw to it that they had an abundant\r\nsupply of fresh drinking-water.\r\n\r\nGrace also was not idle. She mended and patched their clothes with\r\nneedles made of fish-bone and thread made of the fiber of plantain\r\nfruit; and under Armitage's clumsy tuition she quickly learned how to\r\ncook. He showed her how to clean and broil the fish he caught, and\r\ntaught her how to obtain salt by boiling sea water until the water\r\nevaporated. In a cleverly improvised oven which he built for her, she\r\nlearned how to bake delicious cakes of flour made from dried and\r\npulverised plantain fruit. She prepared their meals, which they ate\r\ntogether at regular hours, and for dessert she set before him\r\nplantains, quinces, limes, and cocoanuts which she herself had gathered\r\nin the wood.\r\n\r\nThis constant and intimate association could have only one result. Every\r\nday it brought the proud beauty and her taciturn companion closer than\r\nwould have been possible under any other conditions. At times, in her\r\ninterest in the work of the moment, Grace would entirely forget their\r\ndifference in class. She would unbend and laugh and chat with him as\r\nthough she had known him for years. Then, an instant later, suddenly\r\nconscious of their respective positions and what she thought she owed to\r\nher own dignity, she would relapse into an abrupt silence and draw away\r\nonce more, cold and reserved. But this purely artificial demeanor could\r\nnot be kept up. A few hours later, obeying her natural impulse, she was\r\nherself again, chatting with him freely, asking his opinion, trying to\r\nplease him, full of respect for his superior judgment.\r\n\r\nArmitage listened to her ceaseless prattle, amused at her vivacity,\r\nreplying gravely to her questions, explaining all she wished to know.\r\nDuring long, idle afternoons they would sit together on the beach and\r\nhe would tell her stories of the sea, about lands he had visited,\r\nstrange people he had seen, while Grace, curled up at his feet, like a\r\nchild, listened with breathless attention.\r\n\r\nThus gradually, almost unconsciously, their mutual interest in each\r\nother grew. They became necessary to each other. Sharing common perils,\r\nthey naturally sought each other's companionship, and to Grace as much\r\nas to Armitage the unconventional association and comradeship was as\r\ndelightful as it was novel. Grace was pleased because he treated her not\r\nas other men had done, as a toy, only to be flattered with foolish\r\ncompliments, but as a woman, a helpmate, whose opinion was worth having.\r\n\r\nGreatly to her surprise, Grace soon found herself taking pleasure in\r\nthis bucolic, semi-savage sort of a life. It was so utterly unlike\r\nanything which she had ever known that, at times, she thought it must be\r\nall unreal and that, sooner or later, she would wake up from what was\r\nonly a fantastic dream. But it was real enough. She had only to glance\r\naround her to realize the grim truth. There was Armitage a short\r\ndistance away along the beach trying with a crudely made net to catch\r\nfish for their noonday meal, yonder on top of Mount Hope a column of\r\nblack smoke was ascending to the blue sky--a mute and urgent summons to\r\nthe outer world for help--and if any further testimony were needed she\r\nhad only to look down at her own tattered rags, scarcely recognizable\r\nnow as a gown to bring back with vividness all that had happened since\r\nthe moment the typhoon broke.\r\n\r\nYet, as the time went on, with rescue no nearer than before, Grace\r\nseemed each day more resigned to her precarious situation. She did not\r\nfret so much. Her nervousness disappeared and her spirit became more\r\nbuoyant. There ware moments when she even felt happy. Armitage was quick\r\nto notice it, and by the way he smiled as he greeted her, by the almost\r\nboyish enthusiasm he went about his work, it was evident that he\r\nwelcomed the change.\r\n\r\nGrace was surprised herself. At first it alarmed her to note her growing\r\nindifference. She could not understand the reason. Sensibly she argued\r\nthat she could not be always fretting. If she did, nervous collapse\r\nwould be the consequence. It never occurred to her that this new life in\r\nthe exhilarating sea air explained the secret, that her body was growing\r\nmore healthy and normal under the new hygienic conditions, and that as\r\nher body changed, her mental outlook changed also. The discomforts which\r\nshe had to put up with were, of course, many, and her anxiety regarding\r\nthe outcome of the adventure as poignant as ever, yet in other respects\r\nit was an almost ideal existence.\r\n\r\nThe weather was perfect. She lived, so to speak, in a bower of flowers,\r\nin idyllic peace, with nothing to disturb the general serenity. She had\r\nall the food to eat that her appetite craved for, there was plenty of\r\ncrystal spring water to drink. At night she slept peacefully, lulled by\r\nthe rhythmical music of the waves as they washed lazily against the\r\nshore, and when she awoke the birds were singing their joyous notes of\r\nwelcome to another glorious day. It was the voluptuous life of the\r\ntropics with all its dreamy languor, its sensuous charm.\r\n\r\nConstant living in the open had indeed effected a wonderful improvement\r\nin her personal appearance. Had she possessed a mirror she would\r\nscarcely have recognized in that health-flushed face, tanned by wind and\r\nsun, the pale and languid girl whose condition had alarmed her friends\r\nin New York. With her large dark eyes, clear and limpid, her lips, red\r\nand tempting as cherries, her glorious hair caught up in careless knot,\r\nher bosom fuller, her lines more rounded, her walk with an elasticity it\r\nhad never known before--she was in the full bloom of youth and beauty.\r\nGrace herself realized the change, and vaguely she guessed that this\r\nexplained the new mental attitude she had assumed toward her unfortunate\r\nposition. Not only in body, but in her mind she felt more vigorous. Her\r\ndespondency had given place to a pronounced optimism. She took keen\r\ninterest in everything taking place around her. She was no longer\r\npeevish and irritable. She laughed and chatted with the spontaneous\r\ngaiety of youth, and if it were not for a constantly gnawing anxiety to\r\nknow what the future had in store, to communicate with her parents, she\r\nwould have been content to go on living like this for months.\r\n\r\nNot only were the surroundings ideal and conducive to real happiness,\r\nbut it was a new and pleasurable sensation to her to find that she could\r\nbe of some use in the world. She took pride in doing her share of the\r\nwork, and her respect for herself grew in proportion as she felt that\r\nher services were appreciated by Armitage. Gradually she learned to\r\nscrutinize his face to see if he approved what she had done, and if she\r\nsaw him smile she beamed with satisfaction.\r\n\r\nLong ago she had come to the conclusion that her companion was no\r\nordinary man. Not only was he above his apparent station in life, but he\r\npossessed qualities that she had never yet detected in any of the men\r\nshe had met. Not only was he handsome and built like an Apollo, but she\r\nrecognized his superior mentality. He was born for leadership--that was\r\nevident by the manner in which he had managed things on this island. He\r\nhad suffered in life, for some cause which he kept secret, and had been\r\nforced to take to brutalizing work. But it had not degraded him. He was\r\nkind and gentle, unselfish and brave.\r\n\r\nWhile he succeeded in concealing his own past life, Armitage was less\r\nsuccessful in concealing his interest in his companion. Grace's feminine\r\ntuition told her that he admired her, and, although she knew that\r\nsocially he was far beneath her, she was still woman enough to be\r\ngratified. Besides, she did not seek to disguise from herself the fact\r\nthat she was strangely attracted toward this man. He had about him a\r\nmagnetism which she could not explain. Perhaps more than anything else\r\nit was the very mystery with which he surrounded himself that interested\r\nand attracted her. She found herself speculating strangely. Suppose he\r\nhad been a man of her own class, would she marry him? Was he the type of\r\nman she could love? She remembered Professor Hanson's queer hypothesis\r\nthat afternoon on the steamer. Suppose this man were to make love to her\r\nand insisted on the ties suggested by the professor. What could she do\r\nto protect herself? What could she do? She was utterly helpless. There\r\nwould be nothing to do but throw herself on his generosity.\r\n\r\nIt annoyed her when she realized how much her companion entered into her\r\nthoughts. She tried not to feel lonely when he was away. She tried not\r\nto feel pleased when he returned. But she knew that she was lying to\r\nherself, and at moments it terrified her when slowly it dawned upon her\r\nthat her strange, mysterious companion had entered into her most\r\nintimate life. Was it love? She laughed at the absurdity of the idea,\r\nand to show her indifference, so Armitage might plainly understand the\r\ndifference in their positions, she forced herself to seem cold and\r\nreserved. He noticed the sudden change in her manner, and, unable to\r\naccount for it, thought he must have displeased her.\r\n\r\nOne day he had gone up to Mount Hope to attend, as usual, to the\r\nsignal-fire. She was alone. The day's work was done, and, somewhat\r\nfatigued, she was resting, seated on the verdant, sloping beach\r\noverlooking the sea. At her feet stretched the golden sands, gently\r\nlaved by the rippling, transparent waves. The air was full of sweet\r\nscents, and the temperature so warm that even the thinnest clothing was\r\nalmost unendurable. Drowsy from the heat, she lay under the grateful\r\nshade of spreading trees, and, looking out over the glistening ocean,\r\nwatched the water as it sparkled in the sunlight. Her eyes half-closed,\r\nher entire being thrilled by a novel sensation of languor, she abandoned\r\nherself to the voluptuousness of the place and moment. Had she been\r\nalone, with no one to see her and no danger of a sudden surprise, she\r\nwould have loved to divest herself of all her clothing and, nymphlike,\r\nroll nude in the golden sands like the woman she once saw in a picture\r\ncalled \"The Birth of the Wave.\" Her form was physically as beautiful.\r\nShe wondered if Armitage thought her beautiful--if he ever thought of\r\nher at all as men think of women--and gradually her mind wandered in\r\nstrange channels.\r\n\r\nAs she lay there basking in the ardent sunshine, she felt the\r\npleasurable, exhilarating sensation of enjoying perfect animal health. A\r\nstrange feeling of languor came over her. This, she knew, was happiness\r\nand the joy of life, and yet she felt that there was still something\r\nlacking to make that happiness complete. As her eye dwelt on the\r\nloveliness of the surrounding scene, perhaps for the first time she\r\nunderstood the enthusiasm of those nature lovers who are content only\r\nwhen in the country. What, indeed, were the artificial, tawdry delights\r\nof the man-made cities compared with the delights of life in the\r\nGod-made fields? She thought of overheated ballrooms, inane afternoon\r\nteas, tiresome bridge-parties. What were they compared to lying there,\r\nlistening to the birds singing in the trees, her cheek gently wafted by\r\nthe soft sea breeze, the pure air filling her lungs and shading the\r\ndamask on her cheek. If her dear old dad saw her he would hardly know\r\nher.\r\n\r\nShe knew what her life lacked--love. A man whom she could admire and\r\nrespect, a man who would rule her with his iron will and crush her if\r\nneed be in his strong arms. Would she ever meet such a man? Had she\r\nalready met him? Once more her mind conjured up the picture of the ideal\r\nman--the man of her day-dream on the steamer. If he should come along\r\nnow, would she have the strength of will to resist the pressure of his\r\nardent lips. Her eyes closed, she fancied she saw him coming, his head\r\nthrown back, straight as an arrow, handsome as an Apollo. As he passed\r\nhe stopped, fascinated by her beauty. He came nearer, and with a cry of\r\njoy clasped her closely in furious embrace. Weakly she tried to avoid\r\nthe warm kisses he rained on her too willing mouth. As she turned she\r\nchanced to see his face, and, starting back, she gave a cry. It was a\r\nface she knew. Frightened, she opened her eyes and sat up. Armitage was\r\nstanding before her.\r\n\r\n\"Were you asleep?\" he asked, with a smile. \"I hope I didn't disturb\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where have you been?\" she asked, embarrassed.\r\n\r\n\"Up on Mount Hope tending the fire,\" he replied, his eyes taking in\r\nevery detail of her splendid beauty. Her hair was disarranged and her\r\nbodice open at the neck because of the heat. He thought she looked the\r\nprettier, and he was only human.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing in sight, I suppose,\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"No, nothing,\" he answered.\r\n\r\nShe rose and, going to the cabin, hastened to prepare their supper.\r\n\r\nWhile she bustled about he sat quietly and watched her. He hoped she\r\nwould not read on his face the happiness that was in his heart.\r\n\r\nYes, she had guessed aright. He was happier on this desert island than\r\never before. It was true that he had no wish to be rescued. For him\r\nrescue meant going back to purgatory, while this was Elysium. Never in\r\nall his life had he known such happiness as this. Only one thing was\r\nlacking to make his happiness complete. It was to call this woman--wife.\r\nHe did not know how it had come to him, but he loved her with a\r\nfierceness that frightened him. He did not like to even admit it to\r\nhimself or even to think of it. But he knew that he must have this woman\r\nor his life must end. To live without her was impossible. It was\r\ninconceivable. He had tasted of Heaven these last few weeks, and if he\r\nlost that he must lose everything. Of course it was an impossible dream.\r\nShe was rich. When she left here she would forget him. If one day she\r\nmet him in New York she would even disdain to look at him.\r\n\r\nHe clenched his fists and ground his teeth. Why should he lose this\r\nhappiness that had come to him? He wanted this woman. No one should rob\r\nhim of her. Even if it cost him his life and hers, he was determined to\r\nhave her for his own. Why should he be denied her? Their rescue from\r\nthis island was improbable, if not impossible. Ships never passed near\r\nthere. It was too far from the beaten track, too full of hidden dangers.\r\nNavigators knew that and gave the island a wide berth. He had lied to\r\nher to reassure her, but he knew rescue was out of the question. They\r\nwould spend the rest of their days there. The days would lengthen into\r\nmonths, the months into years. Their youth would go. Old age would come.\r\nThen it would be too late, and they would both be sorry. Why should they\r\nnot mate now? He remembered the mutineers of H. M. S. _Bounty_--a true\r\nstory of the sea which had always fascinated him. The men revolted and\r\nkilled their officers and landed on an island inhabited by savages. They\r\nkilled the men and married the women, and to this day their descendants\r\nwere sturdy fishermen.\r\n\r\nLong after Grace had retired to rest, Armitage sat under the trees alone\r\namid the silent beauty of the tropical night. The stars in their\r\ncountless millions shone bright and resplendent in the clear atmosphere.\r\nThe firmament was a glorious blaze of light. The planets flashed like\r\nsuns, and changed color as he gazed at them. The small stars twinkled\r\nmore humbly in a milky way that stretched across the heavens, while now\r\nand again a brilliant meteor, outlaw of the heavenly host, shot across\r\nspace and as quickly disappeared. It was a spectacle for the gods, but\r\nArmitage heeded it not. Lost in meditation of things more earthly, he\r\nwas wondering if he could win this woman for himself, how he could delay\r\nthe dreaded moment which would take her out of his life.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe next day when he suggested that they explore their lonely domain\r\ntogether, Grace readily consented to accompany him. Laughing merrily and\r\nchattering like a magpie, she walked briskly along at his side. The day\r\nwas ideal. The weather was dry and clear, with an invigorating breeze\r\nfrom the sea, and, as they strode along in the dazzling sunshine, Grace\r\nfelt buoyant with health and exuberant spirits.\r\n\r\nThey followed the coast-line, making their way in and out among the\r\nrocks. From the interstices of the tall cliffs as they approached flew\r\nout hundreds of wild sea-gulls uttering shrill cries of alarm. Armitage\r\npicked up a stone, but Grace stayed his arm.\r\n\r\n\"It's bad luck to kill one,\" she said. \"Let them live. Besides, they're\r\nour neighbors. They're the only other inhabitants besides ourselves.\"\r\n\r\nThe tide was out, so their way along the smooth sands was easy. The\r\nbeach was covered with shells of remarkable luster and beauty, and Grace\r\ninsisted on stopping to gather some. Presently they came to a creek,\r\nwith stepping-stones covered with slippery moss. The problem was how to\r\nget across.\r\n\r\n\"Come along,\" said Armitage, leading the way.\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid I'll fall into the water,\" exclaimed Grace, looking ruefully\r\nat the water.\r\n\r\n\"No, you won't. Take my arm,\" said Armitage.\r\n\r\nThey went across together, her arm closely locked in his.\r\n\r\nSuddenly she slipped. If she had not been holding tight to his arm, she\r\nwould have fallen into the creek. As it was, she was badly frightened,\r\nand clung more nervously to him. He felt her warm body pressed close\r\nagainst his, and a thrill went through him. There was still some\r\ndistance to go before the opposite bank was reached. Putting his arm\r\nround her waist, Armitage reassured her.\r\n\r\n\"You won't fall. Just keep close to me and step as I step,\" he said.\r\n\r\nHe felt her warm breath on his cheek. His head seemed to swim round. It\r\nneeded all his self-control to keep his equilibrium and get across.\r\nFinally they reached the other bank in safety.\r\n\r\nLeaving the beach, they clambered up the rocks, to the higher land,\r\nwhere they found an abundance of coarse grass with ravines and hollows\r\nchoked up with a luxuriant growth of tropical vegetation. They entered a\r\ndense wood, almost impenetrable with tangled foliage, thick undergrowth,\r\nand hidden roots of trees. Carefully, he made a path for her, and once,\r\nwhen they came to a running stream with no way to ford it, he had to\r\nlift her up in his strong arms and take her across like a baby. Soon\r\nthey came to a clearing, sweet with the odor of wild orchids and\r\njasmine. Through the thick foliage of the spreading trees they had\r\nglimpses of the shimmering surface of the turquoise-blue sea. They sat\r\ndown in the grass, glad to rest after their exertions, and when they\r\ngot hungry they ate the provisions Grace had thoughtfully provided. It\r\nwas a delightful picnic, and Grace laughed with glee.\r\n\r\nArmitage had plucked a plantain and was eating the fruit when suddenly\r\nhe stopped and looked fixedly at her.\r\n\r\n\"Why do you look at me like that?\" she asked roguishly.\r\n\r\n\"Because you are nice to look at,\" he answered gravely. \"I look at the\r\nsea because it is beautiful. I look at you. You are beautiful.\"\r\n\r\nShe laughed and reddened. The compliment was clumsy, but it pleased her\r\nbecause she knew he meant it. To her it sounded better than any of the\r\ncompliments paid her in New York's drawing-rooms. To change the\r\nconversation she said:\r\n\r\n\"I wonder if we shall ever get away from here?\"\r\n\r\nHe said nothing, but his eyes sought hers. After a pause, he said\r\nboldly:\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. To be quite honest, I'm in no hurry. I'm very happy\r\nhere.\"\r\n\r\nGrace made no reply. This time she did not even seem angry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother fortnight passed and still no sign from the great wide world\r\nbeyond the seas. The days came and went with monotonous regularity.\r\nAccording to the notches on Grace's shell calendar, which she had made\r\ncarefully with each rising and setting of the sun, they were now well on\r\ntoward the end of September. Three long months had gone by since that\r\nterrible night when the hurricane drove the ill-fated _Atlanta_ on the\r\nreef.\r\n\r\nWould a ship never come? This question Grace had asked herself almost\r\nhourly until gradually the belief came firmly rooted in her mind that\r\nthey would never be rescued, that she was doomed to spend the rest of\r\nher life in this unknown, out of the way island, her grief-stricken\r\nparents believing that she had been drowned when the _Atlanta_ went\r\ndown. If any of the survivors reached land, as she supposed some of them\r\ndid, the news would have been instantly cabled to America, and her name\r\nwould be listed among the missing. No doubt her father had long given\r\nher up for dead. It would never occur for him to come in search of her.\r\nNor was there much chance of a passing vessel ever seeing the smoke from\r\nthe signal-fire. As Armitage had said, they were probably hundreds of\r\nmiles out of the shipping track. In all probability no human being had\r\never set foot on that islet before.\r\n\r\nYet she never quite lost courage. Each day she made her weary pilgrimage\r\nto the summit of Mount Hope and eagerly scanned the horizon. Only\r\ndisappointment awaited her. There was never anything in sight to bring\r\njoy to her heart.\r\n\r\nThey kept the big signal-fire going just the same. Night and day it\r\nburned, sending its flaming message of distress over the vast waste of\r\nheaving waters. It was never permitted to die down. Fresh fuel was piled\r\non until the flames leaped high in the air or the thick black smoke went\r\ncurling up in a long, straight column to the sky. Either the smoke or\r\nthe blaze must be seen miles away at sea. Any moment some ship might\r\nturn out of her course and come to investigate.\r\n\r\nOtherwise they seldom discussed the chances of rescue. By mutual consent\r\nit seemed to be a tabooed topic. Armitage never failed in his\r\nself-appointed task; he kept the fire going with a plentiful supply of\r\ndriftwood, but that was all. He never voluntarily mentioned the\r\nsignal-fire or the prospects of getting away, and intuitively she knew\r\nthat it was a subject that was distasteful to him. If he took the pains\r\nto keep up the fire, he did it for her sake. She understood that, and\r\nshe was mutely grateful to him for it. In return, she was considerate\r\nfor his feelings. She avoided speaking of her desire for a ship to\r\narrive. Occupied with their daily tasks, they never broached the\r\nsubject. When he went up the hill to attend to the fire he was always\r\nalone, and she tactfully selected a time when he was occupied about the\r\nencampment to make her daily climb to Mount Hope.\r\n\r\nWhat if help did not come? Could they--he and she--go on forever living\r\ntogether like this? She was an intelligent girl. She knew that the\r\npresent relations between herself and Armitage were artificial, and\r\nbased wholly upon the conventions of organized society. But they were\r\nunnatural relations, contrary to the laws of nature. In her heart she\r\nknew that she cared more for this strange, silent man than she dared to\r\nadmit. Yes, he was the man of her day-dreams, the man she had waited\r\nfor, the man she could love. She did not ask what he had been. She only\r\nknew him as he was. She loved him for what he was. He was poor, he was\r\nnot what the world calls of gentle birth, yet he had qualities that in\r\nher eyes raised him above all men more favored by fortune. He was one of\r\nnature's noblemen. Some great secret sorrow had wrecked his life, but it\r\nhad not taken from him his sweetness of character, his beauty of face\r\nand mind, his manly courage, his courtesy to a lonely, helpless woman.\r\nShe loved the rich tones of his voice, the sad, wistful gaze in his fine\r\neyes when they looked silently into hers. She knew of what he was\r\nthinking. She knew the dread that was on his heart--the dread of a\r\nmisfortune a hundred times worse than any that had yet embittered his\r\nlife. The dread that one day, sooner or later, the ship would come to\r\ncarry away from him forever the woman who had once more made life seem\r\nworth living.\r\n\r\nOne morning Grace was sitting sewing, deftly plying the fish-bone needle\r\nwhich Armitage had made for her. She was making a desperate effort to\r\npatch up, for the hundredth time, her old battered ball-dress, which\r\nnow, reduced to shreds, scarcely covered her decently. Armitage, no\r\nbetter off as regards attire, was stretched out on the sands near her,\r\nwatching her work. It was a domestic scene. Any stranger chancing to\r\npass that way would have taken them for a young married couple, the man\r\nevidently a fisherman, the woman, his wife, doing the household mending.\r\nA short distance away was their cabin, and on the fire close by the iron\r\nsaucepan in which a savory mess was cooking for their noonday meal.\r\nNothing was lacking to make the picture of connubial felicity complete.\r\n\r\nSome such thought occurred to Armitage, for suddenly he blurted out:\r\n\r\n\"Do you believe in marriage?\"\r\n\r\nShe looked up in surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Do I believe in marriage?\" she smiled. \"What a singular question. Of\r\ncourse I do.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you understand by marriage?\" he persisted.\r\n\r\nGrace thought for a moment and then readily replied:\r\n\r\n\"Marriage is a contract entered into by a man and woman by which they\r\nbecome husband and wife.\"\r\n\r\nNodding assent, he went on:\r\n\r\n\"That is to say, a contract entered into between themselves?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not exactly,\" replied Grace hesitatingly. \"Rather I should say an act\r\nbefore a magistrate or a religious ceremony by which the legal\r\nrelationship is sanctioned by the law and church.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, without such act or ceremony, you would not consider a marriage\r\nbinding or right?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" answered Grace emphatically.\r\n\r\nHe remained silent a moment, and then he said:\r\n\r\n\"But suppose a man and a woman loved each other and wished to enter into\r\nthe married state, and yet were so placed that it was impossible for\r\ntheir union to have the sanction of either the law or church, what\r\nthen?\"\r\n\r\nGrace laid down her work and, shaking her head, looked gravely at her\r\ninterlocutor:\r\n\r\n\"It is difficult to answer such a question offhand,\" she said. \"I think\r\nit would depend altogether on the circumstances and chiefly on the\r\npersonal views of those directly concerned. Some people scoff at\r\nmarriage. Among them are many of my own sex. They regard marriage merely\r\nas a time-honored, worn out convention which really means nothing. They\r\nget married, of course, not because they believe in it as an\r\ninstitution, but as a matter of form, because their mothers did it\r\nbefore them, because it is the thing to do. But not unreasonably, they\r\nargue, that nowadays when it is so easy to obtain a divorce on the most\r\ntrivial pretext, there is not much left about marriage that is sacred\r\nand binding.\"\r\n\r\nHe listened attentively. When she ceased speaking, he asked quietly:\r\n\r\n\"And what is your view? Do you indorse these opinions?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I do not,\" she replied, meeting his steady gaze frankly. \"I\r\nbelieve in marriage. I think it is the noblest gift that civilization\r\nhas bequeathed to the human race. It marks the great divide between man\r\nand the brute. More than that, it protects the woman who is, naturally,\r\nthe weaker, and, above all, it protects the offspring.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right,\" he rejoined quickly, \"yet isn't it curious that man\r\nseems happiest under monogamy, which is directly contrary to nature. Man\r\nis naturally polygamous.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, but that is only brute love. It rests on nothing tangible. Like a\r\ntiny flame, it is extinguished by the first adverse breath of wind. Man\r\nthinks he is polygamous. But that is only the beast in him--the beast\r\nwith which his better and higher nature is ever at war. The superior man\r\nlearns to control his appetites, the baser man indulges them, and\r\ntherefore is nearer to the tailed ancestry from which he originally\r\nsprang. That is not love as I understand it.\"\r\n\r\nHe leaned quickly forward.\r\n\r\n\"How do you understand love?\" he asked, in low, eager tones.\r\n\r\nGrace smiled, and, poutingly, she protested:\r\n\r\n\"Why do you question me in this way?\"\r\n\r\nSlightly raising himself on one hand, he drew nearer to her and looked\r\nsteadily up into her face until the boldness of his gaze embarrassed\r\nher. Her cheeks reddened, and she lowered her eyes.\r\n\r\n\"What do you know about love?\" he demanded hoarsely.\r\n\r\n\"Every woman knows or thinks she knows,\" she replied, with affected\r\ncarelessness.\r\n\r\nHe was silent for a moment, and then he went on:\r\n\r\n\"Suppose a woman--say a friend of yours--loved a man, with all the\r\nstrength of her heart and soul. Suppose special conditions made her\r\nlegal union with that man impossible. Would you forgive her if her great\r\nlove tempted her to give herself to that man, or would you insist that\r\nshe should suffer and make him suffer--alone?\"\r\n\r\nShe listened with averted face. Well she knew the purport of these\r\nquestions. But her face remained impassive, and her voice was calm as\r\nshe replied gently:\r\n\r\n\"No woman may sit in judgment over another woman. No woman can tell\r\npositively what she might do under all circumstances. The temptation\r\nmight be such that even a saint would succumb. That reminds me. Do you\r\nknow the story of the Abbess of Jouarre?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied Armitage; \"what is it? Tell it me.\"\r\n\r\nHe settled down more comfortably in the sand to listen. Grace smiled,\r\nand took up her sewing again.\r\n\r\n\"It's a story that made a deep impression on me,\" she said. \"It was\r\nduring the bloodiest days of the French Revolution. On the Place de la\r\nConcorde a hundred lives were being sacrificed on the guillotine daily\r\nto appease the savage fury of the populace. Among the aristocrats\r\nsentenced to death and who awaited in the Temple prison their turn to be\r\nsummoned to the scaffold was a chevalier, scion of one of the proudest\r\nfamilies of France and an Abbess, a woman of gentle birth, both of whom\r\nhad been denounced to the Revolutionary tribunal. They had known and\r\nloved each other as children, and they met in prison for the first time\r\nsince the Abbess had taken her vows. Closely associated within the\r\ndungeon's grim walls they soon discovered that time had not killed\r\ntheir youthful infatuation. In the shadow of death the Abbess was\r\nwilling to admit that she had loved the chevalier all these years, that\r\nshe had prayed for him and carried his image in her heart. He clasped\r\nher in his arms and, pleading his unconquerable passion, he urged her to\r\nforget her vows and give herself to him. Kindly, but firmly, she\r\nwithdrew from his embrace and gravely recalled him to a sense of duty.\r\nShe declared that being now the affianced bride of Heaven, it was\r\nforbidden for her to even think of earthly ties or joys. But the\r\nchevalier refused to listen to reason or to calm his ardor. He insisted\r\nthat such love as theirs was sacred, and that her vows to the Church did\r\nnot bind her, now that she was about to die. In another few hours they\r\nwould both be dead. Her duty, during the short time she had yet to live,\r\nwas to yield to the promptings of her heart rather than to heed the\r\ndictates of her conscience. Their union, he said, would be a marriage\r\nbefore God, and after their earthly death they would be united forever\r\nin Heaven. The Abbess listened. Her great love gradually gained the\r\nmastery over her moral scruples. Her opposition weakened. The chevalier\r\ntook her again in his arms.\"\r\n\r\nGrace ceased speaking. Armitage, his face betraying more and more\r\ninterest, waited for her to continue.\r\n\r\n\"That is not all,\" he said interrogatively.\r\n\r\nGrace shook her head.\r\n\r\n\"No, now comes the tragedy of it.\" Continuing, she went on: \"The next\r\nday the prison doors were thrown open, and brutal jailers read out the\r\nlists of names of those prisoners who that morning must ride in the\r\nfatal death-cart. Among the first summoned was the chevalier. Tenderly\r\nhe bade the Abbess farewell. Death he hailed with joy, for it marked the\r\nbeginning of their coming felicity in another and better world. He\r\ndisappeared, and the Abbess awaited her turn. Other names were called,\r\nbut hers was not among them. The jailer stopped reading and turned to\r\ndepart. The Abbess tremulously asked when her hour, too, would come. The\r\njailer answered: 'You go free--by order of the Tribunal.'\"\r\n\r\nAgain Grace was silent. Armitage seemed lost in thought. Presently he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"And the Abbess--what became of her?\"\r\n\r\n\"She had to bear her cross for her great sin. Her punishment was worse\r\nthan death. Not only had she broken her vows and offended Heaven, but\r\nshe was separated forever from the man to whom she had given her love.\r\nCursed by the Church, shunned by everybody, she wandered miserably from\r\nvillage to village, leading by the hand a little child.\"\r\n\r\nArmitage was silent for a few minutes, and then he said:\r\n\r\n\"You were reminded of this story by some remark you had previously made:\r\nWhat was it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I said in answer to your hypothesis as to what a woman would or would\r\nnot do for a man she loved, that even a saint might succumb, given\r\ncertain circumstances. The Abbess was a saint. Yet she sinned.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think I would call that a sin,\" objected Armitage. \"The real\r\nsinner was the judge who pardoned her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not the chevalier who tempted her?\" rejoined Grace.\r\n\r\nHe made no answer, but remained looking steadfastly at her. Then rising\r\nabruptly to his feet, he began to pace nervously up and down the sands.\r\nHis face was pale, his eyes flashed, the muscles around his mouth\r\ntwitched. He gave every sign of being under an intense emotional strain.\r\nThere was something to be said, and he dare not say it. It was a novelty\r\nfor him to find himself lacking in courage. At any other time he would\r\nhave faced a tiger about to spring; he would have looked without\r\nflinching into the muzzle of a leveled rifle. But at that instant he\r\nquailed like a craven--he dared not tell this girl that he loved her and\r\nwanted her for his wife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe disappeared and Grace did not see him again for the remainder of that\r\nday. All afternoon she waited, expecting each moment to see him\r\nreappear. Not wishing to be away in case he suddenly returned and wanted\r\nsome supper, she omitted her customary visit to Mount Hope.\r\n\r\nAt first she did not mind his long absence. Busily preoccupied with her\r\nsewing and half a dozen other tasks about the camp, the time passed so\r\nquickly that she hardly noticed it. But when darkness commenced to fall\r\nand still he did not come, she began to feel uneasy. He had not told her\r\nthat he expected to be gone so long. Something must have happened.\r\nPerhaps he had met with an accident and at that very moment was lying\r\nhurt, in need of assistance. She turned hot and cold by turns at this\r\nthought. Suppose he were killed! A sudden choking sensation in her\r\nthroat, a quickened beating of her heart, told her that it would be a\r\ngreater misfortune than any that had yet befallen her. If she had never\r\nfully realized it before, Grace knew now that this man had come to be\r\npart of her own life.\r\n\r\nNight fell, with its profound silence and its mysterious sounds. Nature\r\nslept. The chirping of crickets, the croaking of frogs, the mournful\r\nsighing of the wind in the trees, the sullen splash of the waves on the\r\nsandy beach, were the only audible sounds. It was the first time that\r\nGrace had been left so long alone since they set foot on the island. In\r\nthe daytime, with the sun shining, the birds singing and everything\r\nplainly visible for miles around, she did not care. But the darkness,\r\nthe solemn silence, the strange inexplicable noises she heard every now\r\nand again in the wood--all this frightened her. Everything around her\r\nassumed strange, unfamiliar shapes. At one time she thought she saw some\r\nobject with gleaming eyes approaching the cabin. Her flesh began to\r\ncreep. Terrified, she quickly retreated inside the cabin and,\r\nbarricading the door with table and chairs, crouched down by the window,\r\nstraining her ears to hear some sound of Armitage.\r\n\r\nSuppose something had happened to him! Then she would be quite alone,\r\nentirely defenceless. The mere thought of such an eventuality caused the\r\nblood to freeze in her veins. How could she be alone on that desert\r\nisland? She would go stark, staring mad. Ah, now she knew what his\r\ncompanionship had meant to her. If only he would come back, she would\r\nhardly be able to resist the temptation to throw her arms round his\r\nneck. He was more necessary to her every day. No one can live without\r\nhuman companionship. She must have some one to talk to. Besides, every\r\nhour it dawned upon her more strongly that she loved this strange,\r\nsolitary man. Even at this moment of terror it was love as much as fear\r\nthat racked her heart with anxiety and anguish.\r\n\r\nMorning was just breaking in the east when all at once he reappeared.\r\n\r\n\"Where have you been?\" she asked tremulously.\r\n\r\nShe averted her eyes so he should not see that she had been weeping.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" he answered curtly.\r\n\r\nHe seemed worn and tired. His boots were muddy, his clothes had fresh\r\nrents and stains. He looked as if he had been tramping through the\r\nwoods all night.\r\n\r\n\"Will you eat something?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"Don't bother,\" he replied. \"I'll get something.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's no trouble,\" she said. Going quickly to their simple larder, she\r\nput before him some cold fish and plantain cakes.\r\n\r\nHe ate ravenously, in stubborn silence. When she spoke to him, he\r\nreplied in low monosyllables. His eyes seemed to avoid her searching,\r\ninquiring gaze. Once she happened to turn quietly and she caught him\r\nstaring at her in a strange way. His manner somewhat intimidated her.\r\nShe wondered if she could possibly have done or said something to\r\ndisplease him.\r\n\r\nIt grew lighter every minute, but the day promised to be gloomy. The sun\r\nwas invisible behind a bank of mist, and the entire sky was overcast. It\r\nlooked like rain. There was a damp chill in the air. The weather seemed\r\nin harmony with Armitage's unaccountable behavior. Grace felt chilled\r\nherself. She had a presentiment that something was about to happen.\r\nWhether it would affect her or him she did not know, but instinct told\r\nher that danger of some kind threatened.\r\n\r\nSomething troubled her companion, that was certain. What its nature was,\r\nshe could not guess. She had never seen him so moody or acting so\r\nstrangely. But, unwilling to put herself in the delicate position of\r\nasking for confidence he withheld, she desisted from any further\r\nquestioning, and, leaving him alone, went to her cabin. She was\r\nexhausted from her long vigil and it was not many minutes after she\r\nthrew herself down on the bed before she was fast asleep.\r\n\r\nWhen she awoke he was gone. He had disappeared mysteriously, just as he\r\nhad the first time, without leaving a word behind or a single indication\r\nto tell where he was going, or how long he would be away. Yet he had not\r\nentirely forgotten her. He had brought a fresh supply of spring water,\r\nand before the door of her cabin she found some freshly caught fish and\r\na new supply of plantains.\r\n\r\nRefreshed after her sleep, Grace went cheerfully about her usual morning\r\ntasks. She tidied her cabin, took her sea bath, and prepared the\r\nnoonday meal. So busy was she that Armitage's new absence remained\r\nunnoticed. In fact, she dismissed him from her mind. If she thought of\r\nhim at all it was to wonder vaguely what ailed him, and speculate idly\r\nhow long his mood would last. By the time the sun was directly overhead,\r\nher work was done. Armitage not having returned, she ate her meal alone.\r\n\r\nIt was no use waiting around any longer, so she started, after dinner,\r\nfor Mount Hope. For two days she had not paid her regular visit to the\r\nsignal-fire. She felt a sense of guilt, as if she had neglected the one\r\nthing which alone could save her.\r\n\r\nIt was a difficult, laborious climb up the hill, and she was compelled\r\nto rest several times on the way to the summit. She looked up as she\r\nwent, trying to catch a glimpse of the smoke that was announcing to the\r\nwhole universe that two human beings were in need of immediate relief.\r\nShe could not see the smoke, owing to the projecting rocks which hid the\r\nsummit from view. At the next turn she would come in sight of it. Up and\r\nup she went, out of breath.\r\n\r\nEvery now and then she halted and looked back. At this height, fully\r\n500 feet above the sea, she commanded a superb view of the entire\r\nisland. A few barren rocks connected by grassy and thickly wooded\r\nplateaus, it made but a speck on the surface of the wide ocean. Below,\r\nunder the shelter of the tall cliffs, she saw their two cabins nestling\r\nunder the trees. Thinking she might catch a glimpse of Armitage, she\r\nstrained her eyes in every direction. But he was nowhere to be seen.\r\nThere was not a sign of life anywhere. Not a human voice, not the bark\r\nof a dog. Even the birds were dumb. Perfect stillness reigned, as in the\r\nhabitation of the dead.\r\n\r\nNever so well as now had she realized their complete isolation. Her\r\nheart sank. Even if a vessel passed, how could she hope that an islet as\r\nsmall as this would be noticed? A sailing-master would not think for a\r\nminute that it harbored survivors of a shipwreck. Their only chance of\r\nattracting attention was the signal-fire.\r\n\r\n\"Thank God,\" she murmured, \"that we had the means to light a fire. It\r\nhas never been allowed to go out. Night and day it sends out its\r\nwireless message for aid!\"\r\n\r\nShe resumed her climb and presently reached the summit. Only another\r\nturn in the road and she would come in sight of the huge bonfire,\r\nblazing and crackling as it sent its message of distress far out to sea.\r\nImpatient to see it, she hastened her steps, almost running, in her\r\nanxiety to get there. Round the bend she went until, breathless, she\r\nemerged on the broad plateau.\r\n\r\nSuddenly she stopped and turned pale. Could she have mistaken the road?\r\nNo, this was the place. But where was the signal-fire? The spot where it\r\nhad burned night and day all these weeks was plainly visible. The grass\r\nand ground all around was charred and blackened by the flames, but of\r\nthe fire itself nothing remained. Some giant strength had wreaked its\r\nfury upon it, scattered the glowing embers right and left, drowned it\r\nout with water. The signal-fire was extinguished!\r\n\r\nPale and trembling, Grace stood rooted to the ground, trying to\r\nunderstand. Who had done this? Why had he done it? Of course, only one\r\nperson could have done it. Was this the explanation of Armitage's long\r\nabsence the previous night? Why had he scattered and drowned out their\r\nsignal-fire?\r\n\r\nHer face flushed with anger. Her apprehension gave place to indignation.\r\nBy what right had he presumed to take this step? If he were willing to\r\nsacrifice himself, what right had he to sacrifice her?\r\n\r\nTurning on her steps, she hastened down the hill and soon reached their\r\nencampment. He was there to greet her, standing with folded arms,\r\nsilent, as if he knew where she had been and was awaiting the first\r\noutburst of her reproaches and anger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The fire is out!\" she cried, as she came within speaking distance.\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" he answered stolidly. His face was expressionless, not a\r\nmuscle moved. An observer might have mistaken him for a figure cast in\r\nbronze.\r\n\r\n\"How did it go out?\" demanded Grace, trying to control herself.\r\n\r\nStill he made no answer.\r\n\r\n\"How did it go out?\" she repeated. \"Did you put it out?\"\r\n\r\nArmitage nodded. Then, with a defiant toss of his head, he said:\r\n\r\n\"Yes--I put it out.\"\r\n\r\nGrace stared at him in utter astonishment, scarcely able to believe her\r\nears. She was so overwrought with indignation that everything seemed to\r\nswim before her eyes. She felt weak and faint. Fearing that she would\r\nfall, she leaned against a tree for support.\r\n\r\n\"You put it out! You put it out!\" she gasped. \"Why--tell me why.\"\r\n\r\nHe shrugged his shoulders, and for a moment made no answer. Then, with\r\neyes averted from hers, he said in a low tone:\r\n\r\n\"What's the use of letting it burn any longer? Nobody will see it if it\r\nburns till doomsday. It might burn on forever, till there was no more\r\nwood left on the island to feed it with, and still you'd be here eating\r\nyour heart out waiting for help that would never come. It was labor\r\nthrown away.\"\r\n\r\nUnable to control herself any longer, Grace burst out passionately,\r\nalmost hysterically.\r\n\r\n\"So that is it? Because it was hard work, you sacrifice me! Because you\r\nprefer this idle, savage existence to the hard life you used to lead,\r\nyou do not wish to get away. I must spend here my youth, the rest of my\r\ndays because this sort of life pleases you. And you don't hesitate to\r\ndestroy my only chance of relief because it suits you. How dare you! I\r\nthought you were a man. I was mistaken. A true man would not take\r\nadvantage of a helpless woman's misfortune to further his own selfish\r\ninterests. You are free to stay in this lonely spot if you choose, but\r\nI will not. I refuse to sacrifice myself. I will go away in spite of\r\nyou. I don't know how, but I will find some way, and when I get back\r\namong my friends I shall tell them how a man treated a poor defenceless\r\ngirl.\"\r\n\r\nHe made a step toward her, as if about to say something, when she\r\nretreated and exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"Don't come near me!\" she cried, almost hysterically. \"I hate you. I\r\nwon't let you address me again until that fire is lighted.\"\r\n\r\nShe sank down on the stump of a tree and, burying her face in her hands,\r\ngave way, womanlike, to a torrent of tears. When the hysterical spell\r\nhad passed, he was still standing humbly before her, looking down at\r\nher, with a sad, set expression on his face.\r\n\r\n\"Won't you listen to me?\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"I won't listen to anything until you have lighted the fire once more,\"\r\nwas her stubborn reply.\r\n\r\nOverhead the sun suddenly broke through the heavy gray clouds. The mists\r\nslowly lifted. Once more land and water were bathed in a flood of\r\ncheering sunshine. Grace's moods were mercurial. All that morning she\r\nhad been particularly depressed because of the weather. As Nature put on\r\na fairer garb, her spirits rose. She now felt sorry she had spoken so\r\nharshly to him. At least, she might have given him a chance to explain.\r\n\r\n\"Won't you listen?\" he asked again.\r\n\r\nHe spoke pleadingly, without anger, the rich tones of his voice\r\ntrembling with suppressed emotion. Standing bareheaded, the sun falling\r\nfull on his tanned face and neck, he looked strikingly handsome.\r\n\r\n\"Why did you extinguish the fire?\" she demanded again in a low and more\r\nconciliatory tone.\r\n\r\nLeaning over toward her, he said:\r\n\r\n\"Can't you guess the real reason?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because of the trouble--you said as much.\"\r\n\r\nHe shook his head and there was a note of reproach in his voice as he\r\nreplied:\r\n\r\n\"You don't think that is the reason. You ought to know that I should\r\nconsider no task too irksome if it would add to your happiness.\"\r\n\r\nHe spoke so earnestly that Grace looked up at him in surprise. What did\r\nhe mean? His eyes met hers without flinching. He was silent. She saw he\r\nwanted to say something and hesitated. She knew not why, but there was\r\nsomething disturbing in this man's silent, persistent gaze.\r\n\r\n\"What is the real reason?\" she murmured, at last.\r\n\r\n\"Can't you guess?\" he demanded hoarsely.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" she replied, outwardly calm, but with misgivings within.\r\n\r\n\"Because I love you!\" he cried passionately.\r\n\r\nHe sprang eagerly forward, as if about to take her in his arms. Grace,\r\nstartled, fell back.\r\n\r\n\"You love me?\" she repeated mechanically.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I love you--I love you!\" he repeated wildly. \"Haven't you seen it,\r\nhaven't you felt it all along?\"\r\n\r\nThe color fled from her cheeks. Her lips trembled. The crucial moment\r\nwhich she had dreaded had arrived at last.\r\n\r\n\"If you love me,\" she said, with a forced smile, \"you have a curious way\r\nof showing it. You know that all my hopes centered on that signal-fire,\r\nand yet wilfully, deliberately, you destroyed it. If you love me, why\r\ndid you do that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because,\" he said in a hoarse whisper, \"I was afraid that some ship\r\nmight see the blaze and come and take you away. I love you so much that\r\nI'd stop at nothing. You are the first woman I've ever loved. You don't\r\nknow what that means to me. When a man of my age loves for the first\r\ntime, the force of his passion frightens him. These last two days and\r\nnights I have purposely avoided you. I have tried to control and master\r\nmyself. I have tried to forget you, to banish you from my thoughts. All\r\nlast night I tramped through the woods, trying to persuade myself that\r\nit was an impossible dream, that such happiness could never befall such\r\na poor devil as I. But I could not--I could not. In each tree I saw your\r\ndear face, in every sigh of the wind I heard the plaintive sounds of\r\nyour sweet voice. Then, suddenly, I caught sight of the blaze on that\r\nhill. Instantly I felt it was my enemy. I knew that if a ship came I\r\nwould lose you. I realized that it would mean the end of my happiness.\r\nMaddened by the thought, I was seized by a sudden fury. I ran all the\r\nway up to the top of the hill and trampled it out. Can't you understand\r\nthat I don't want to lose you, that I don't want you to go?\"\r\n\r\nGrace listened, her face flushed. When he ceased speaking, she said\r\ngently:\r\n\r\n\"Any woman would feel pleased and honored at what you say. You have been\r\nvery kind to me. I shall never forget what I owe you. I am deeply\r\ngrateful. I shall always remember you.\" Hesitatingly she added: \"It may\r\nbe that you are right--that a ship will never come--what then? What do\r\nyou want me to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"To--to be my wife!\" he replied quickly and eagerly.\r\n\r\nGrace gasped. She was not without a sense of humor and the incongruity\r\nof the situation was at once apparent to her. Really he went too far. He\r\nwas making her a serious proposal of marriage. This sailor, fireman,\r\nstoker, or whatever he might be, was actually asking the heiress to\r\nmillions, one of the prizes of New York's matrimonial market--to be his\r\nwife! It was too absurd. Only the grave, pleading expression in\r\nArmitage's face deterred her from laughing outright. If any of her set\r\nin New York heard of it, they would chaff her without mercy.\r\n\r\n\"How handsome he is!\" she murmured to herself as she looked at him.\r\n\"What a pity we are not social equals!\"\r\n\r\nShe was sorry for him, of course, but it would be kinder if she put him\r\nat once in his place and made him understand the hopelessness of his\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n\"Do you hear?\" he said hoarsely, his voice quivering from suppressed\r\nemotion. \"I want you--I want you to be my wife!\"\r\n\r\nGrace drew herself up with the air of offended dignity of a queen hurt\r\nin her pride. Her gown was in tatters, her lovely hair hung loose over\r\nher snow-white shoulders. With her cheeks slightly flushed and her large\r\ndark eyes dilated and more lustrous from excitement, never had she\r\nappeared to him more beautiful or desirable. Like a trembling felon at\r\nthe dock waiting to hear the judge pronounce his fate, Armitage waited\r\nfor her answer.\r\n\r\n\"Your wife?\" she replied not unkindly. \"Do you know what I am, do you\r\nrealize what position I hold in society? Don't you know that my father\r\nis one of America's kings of finance, that his fortune is twenty\r\nmillions, and that our winter and summer homes are among the\r\nshow-places of Fifth Avenue and Newport? Don't you know that I spend\r\n$10,000 a year on my dress, that I have a dozen servants to run at my\r\ncall, that my carriages, my horses, gowns and jewels furnish endless\r\nmaterial for the society reporters of the yellow journals? Men have\r\nproposed to me--men of means, men of my own class. I refused them all\r\nbecause they hadn't money enough.\" With a scornful toss of her head, she\r\nadded: \"I despise a husband who looks to his wife for support.\"\r\n\r\nArmitage had listened patiently until now, but her last words aroused\r\nhim. Suddenly interrupting her, he broke in:\r\n\r\n\"You refused them not because they weren't rich enough, but because you\r\ndidn't love them. You can't deceive me. I haven't watched and studied\r\nyou all these weeks for nothing. You aren't as shallow and heartless as\r\nyou pretend. You are too intelligent to find pleasure in Society's inane\r\npastimes. You admitted to me yourself that something seemed lacking in\r\nyour life. Shall I tell you what it is?\"\r\n\r\nHe advanced closer and, looking fixedly at her, went on:\r\n\r\n\"I can read the secret in your beautiful eyes--the windows of your soul.\r\nShall I tell you what your heart desires? You are love-hungry. Your\r\nwhole being cries out for love. Not the infamous traffic in flesh and\r\nhonor which receives the blessing of fashionable churches, but the pure,\r\ntrue, unselfish, ideal love that thrills a man and woman under God's\r\nfree sky. What good are your father's millions here? What do I care\r\nabout your houses, your gowns and your jewels? Here, stripped of\r\neverything but your own sweet lovable nature, you are only a woman--a\r\nwoman I love and want to call mine own.\"\r\n\r\nHis voice held her spellbound. The tone of authority in his words\r\nweakened her will-power. His ardent eyes, looking tenderly into hers,\r\nfascinated her. She felt that the odds were fearfully against her. It\r\nrequired all her moral strength to resist his pleading, yet there was\r\nnothing here to which she could cling. At home, in New York, she could\r\ntake refuge behind a hundred excuses. The polite conventions of society\r\nwould lend her support. But here alone on this lonely island with this\r\nman whom she knew in her heart she loved, this man who insisted on frank\r\nexplanations, straightforward answers, the odds were fearfully against\r\nher. She felt herself weakening.\r\n\r\n\"Please don't,\" she murmured confusedly. \"It's utterly impossible. Don't\r\nyou see how impossible it is--even if I did care for you? In a short\r\ntime a ship will come. We shall be taken off. We shall go back to New\r\nYork. Each of us will resume the old life, and this adventure will be\r\nonly a memory.\"\r\n\r\nArmitage laughed cynically, and he made a gesture of impatience. His\r\nmanner suddenly changed. He assumed the old tone of superiority which\r\nshe had noticed when they first landed on the island.\r\n\r\n\"Don't deceive yourself,\" he said abruptly. \"Some day things must be\r\nunderstood as they are, and it might just as well be now.\"\r\n\r\nHe stopped and looked at her strangely.\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\" demanded Grace uneasily.\r\n\r\n\"I mean,\" he went on slowly, \"that no ship will come. We shall never go\r\nback. The rest of our days must be spent here together.\"\r\n\r\nHe spoke with such authority, such conviction, that Grace felt that he\r\nhad good grounds for what he said. Her face paled and a feeling of\r\nfaintness came over her.\r\n\r\n\"How do you know?\" she demanded, with tears in her eyes.\r\n\r\n\"I've known it all along,\" he replied.\r\n\r\n\"But didn't you say that whaling-vessels made these waters their\r\nfishing-grounds?\" she persisted.\r\n\r\n\"I lied,\" he answered frankly. \"I was sorry for you, so I invented that\r\nfiction.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, the signal-fire was useless!\" she cried, almost hysterical.\r\n\r\nHe nodded.\r\n\r\n\"Yes--utterly useless. I kept it up only to please you. There isn't one\r\nchance in a thousand of it ever being seen. You had to be told the truth\r\nsome time.\"\r\n\r\nGrace stood listening to him, completely overwhelmed, as if in a trance.\r\nIn these few brief moments he had destroyed every hope which she had\r\nnourished for weeks. All her watching and waiting and praying had been\r\nin vain. She was doomed to spend the rest of her days on this lonely\r\nisland--with him! Her head seemed in a whirl. She felt dizzy and faint.\r\nThen she tried to collect her thoughts to reason it out, to picture the\r\nfuture. Suppose it was true, suppose they had to stay there together\r\nforever. How would it affect her? What would their life be as the years\r\nwent on? They would gradually change their habits. The culture and\r\ncareful training of her youth would soon be forgotten. Removed from the\r\nrefining influence of civilization, she and Armitage would slowly\r\ndegenerate, they would revert to the semi-savage condition of their\r\nprehistoric forbears. In time, the last remnant of their clothes would\r\ngo, they would be obliged to make clothes of animals skins or of\r\nplantain leaves. They would cease cooking their food, finding greater\r\nrelish in devouring it raw. Their hair would grow long and matted, their\r\nhands would look like claws. They might even lose the power of speech\r\nand if, in years to come, a ship chanced to touch at the island, they\r\nwould find two gibbering human-like creatures who had forgotten who\r\nthey were and where they came from.\r\n\r\nShe gave a low moan of despair. Armitage approached her. She looked up\r\nat him appealingly:\r\n\r\n\"Is there no hope at all?\"\r\n\r\nHe shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"No--none.\"\r\n\r\nShe covered her face with her hands. He could see that she was weeping.\r\n\r\n\"Don't cry,\" he said gently. \"It's no use fretting. We can't fight\r\nfate.\" Tenderly he added: \"Do you understand now why I said I loved you?\r\nDo you think I would have dared if I thought we should ever get away? I\r\ntold you because I knew we must spend our lives in lonely solitude, and\r\nI knew we could not go on living as we have been. I want you for my\r\nwife. You cannot object. The obstacles you mentioned no longer exist.\"\r\n\r\nGrace started to her feet. There was a note of defiance and alarm in her\r\nvoice as she replied:\r\n\r\n\"If I must stay here and die here, I will. God's will be done. But I\r\nwill live as I think is right, as I would live anywhere else. Being\r\nhere alone with you makes no difference.\"\r\n\r\nHe folded his arms and looked at her boldly.\r\n\r\n\"It does make a difference,\" he said slowly and firmly. \"We are here--a\r\nman and a woman--alone on a desert island amid the eternal silence of\r\nthe mighty ocean. There are only two of us. We are all the world to each\r\nother. Our future days must be spent together in the closest intimacy.\r\nWe cannot go on living as though we were strangers. It isn't natural.\r\nYou ought to be able to see that. The objections you mentioned would\r\nkeep us apart under ordinary conditions, but here the conditions are\r\naltogether different. You are no longer the courted heiress, the society\r\nfavorite. You are a woman and I am a man. The artificial conventions to\r\nwhich you cling have no place on this island. Here we are living amid\r\nprimitive conditions. Nature gave woman to man--she was intended to be\r\nhis mate, his companion. I assert my rights as the male.\"\r\n\r\nHe spoke harshly, in a tone of command, as if he allowed her to have a\r\nsay in the matter, but intended to have his way in the end, after all.\r\n\r\nGrace found herself listening passively. She wondered why she did not\r\nburst out with indignation when he thus disposed of her as if she were\r\nhis goods, his chattel. Yet, secretly, it pleased her to have him assume\r\nthis tone of ownership. The men in society who had fawned upon her were\r\ntame, weak, despicable creatures, ready to lick her hand for a smile.\r\nThis was a real man. He gave her orders. He told her what he wished her\r\nto do, and he said she must do it. As she listened to his rich, musical\r\nvoice she thought to herself that, after all, he was right. Sooner or\r\nlater it must come to that. The years would pass. They would get old\r\ntogether. Would it not be more natural, would not their lives be happier\r\nif they mated and had children to be the joy of their reclining years?\r\n\r\nArmitage boldly took her hand. She did not resist. She had not the\r\nstrength. This man had strangely paralyzed all her will-power.\r\n\r\nHe drew her fiercely to his breast and whispered ardently:\r\n\r\n\"I love you, Grace! I love you!\"\r\n\r\nHis warm breath was upon her cheek. She felt his strong body pressed\r\nclose against hers. A sudden feeling of vertigo came over her.\r\n\r\n\"I love you--I love you!\" he repeated wildly, crushing her slender form\r\nin his powerful arms.\r\n\r\nShe made no attempt to resist, but remained passive in his caress, as if\r\na prisoner who knew there was no hope of escape. Yet there was no\r\nindication of anger on her face. Why shouldn't she love this man? If\r\ntheir lives were to be spent together, she must be his helpmate, his\r\ncompanion. Besides, she knew she was lying to herself. She did love\r\nhim--with all her soul. This was the man she had been waiting for, the\r\nman who would have the courage to overcome her resistance, to take her\r\nfiercely in his arms and cry \"I love you--I want you!\"\r\n\r\nShe closed her eyes, her head fell back. He leaned forward until his\r\nlips almost touched hers. Why did he hesitate? Why didn't he take the\r\nprize which was already his? He felt her warm body vibrating with the\r\npassion his ardor had awakened.\r\n\r\n\"I love you--I love you!\" he cried. \"Grace, tell me--will you be mine?\"\r\n\r\nHer eyes were closed. Her head, with its wealth of luxuriant hair all\r\nloose, fell back on his shoulder. Her face was upturned, her lips half\r\nparted. Trembling with emotion, he leaned forward. His mouth slowly\r\napproached hers for the kiss which was to seal their union, when\r\nsuddenly he heard a shout.\r\n\r\n\"Ahoy there! Ahoy there!\"\r\n\r\nThe sound of a human voice in that deserted spot was so utterly\r\nunexpected, so entirely unlooked for, that for a moment Armitage and\r\nGrace started back in alarm. Armitage thus rudely aroused out of his\r\nday-dreams, hurried forward to investigate.\r\n\r\n\"Ahoy there! Ahoy there!\" came the shout again.\r\n\r\nThere was no mistake this time. Some one was calling, in English.\r\n\r\nPresently they saw half a dozen sailors clambering over the rocks and\r\nrunning toward them. They were Americans.\r\n\r\nGrace sank to her knees.\r\n\r\n\"Thank God!\" she murmured. \"Rescued at last!\"\r\n\r\nA boatswain and five sailors came up, looking with interest at Armitage\r\nand Grace.\r\n\r\n\"Who are you?\" cried out the boatswain, as they approached.\r\n\r\nArmitage went forward.\r\n\r\n\"We were wrecked on the Blue Star Steamship _Atlanta_, which went down\r\nin a hurricane on those reefs about six weeks ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"Passengers?\" asked the boatswain.\r\n\r\nArmitage hesitated. Then, pointing to Grace, he said:\r\n\r\n\"This lady was a cabin passenger.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you?\" demanded the man.\r\n\r\n\"Stoker,\" replied Armitage grimly.\r\n\r\nThe other sailors looked at each other and laughed.\r\n\r\n\"We landed to get water,\" explained the boatswain, \"and chanced to\r\nstumble across human foot-prints. Knowing the island was deserted, we\r\ndecided to follow up the tracks. And here we are. I guess you're glad to\r\nsee us.\"\r\n\r\nArmitage was silent.\r\n\r\n\"Thank God!\" murmured Grace. \"Where is your ship? What is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"The _Saucy Polly_, of Boston, Mass., and as fine a whaler as you ever\r\nsaw. We're anchored on the other side of the island. I guess that's why\r\nyou didn't see us.\"\r\n\r\n\"An American ship--God be praised,\" murmured Grace, clasping her hands.\r\n\"Will you take us home?\"\r\n\r\n\"That we will, Miss. We couldn't leave you here.\"\r\n\r\nOvercome with emotion, Grace suddenly burst into tears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nFifth Avenue presented its customary animated and brilliant picture of\r\nrefined cosmopolitan life. The sidewalks were crowded to the curb with\r\nstylishly dressed promenaders, the roadway blocked with smart\r\nautomobiles and handsome equipages. The all New York of fashion and\r\nwealth was taking its afternoon sunning.\r\n\r\nFor the foreigner making a study of our national manners, the Avenue's\r\nfive-o'clock parade any fine afternoon during the season presents a\r\nscene as typically American as he may expect to find. Here in this one\r\nnarrow, splendid thoroughfare, stretching in a noble line, as the crow\r\nflies, from Twenty-third Street away up to the Nineties, is concentrated\r\nthe fabulous, incalculable wealth of the United States. Here, side by\r\nside, dwell the Rockefellers, the Carnegies, the Vanderbilts, the\r\nAstors, the Goulds, the Harrimans, the Morgans, the Whitneys, and other\r\ngiants of finance, whose fortunes aggregate thousands of millions of\r\ndollars! Lined on either side of the street with the marble palaces of\r\nits multi-millionaires, its roadway jammed with carriages and\r\nautomobiles kept in order by picturesque mounted police, its sidewalks\r\nthronged with pretty, stylish girls, and men and women famous in art,\r\nmusic, politics, science and literature--New York's most exclusive\r\nthoroughfare is perhaps the one place where the American plutocracy is\r\non exhibition in all its aggressive opulence. The show street of New\r\nYork, it is not laid with rails for electric cars like other\r\nthoroughfares of the metropolis. Wagons and trucks not having special\r\nbusiness there are forbidden to traverse it. The poor man understands\r\nthat it is the exclusive domain of the very rich, that he has no place\r\nthere, and that if he appears on its sacred pavements he is apt to be\r\nlooked upon as an audacious intruder.\r\n\r\nArmitage rested from his work and looked around him, dazed by the bustle\r\nand noise. The gay, busy city was such a contrast with the quiet,\r\npeaceful life he had led for the past few months that the sudden change\r\nwas startling. It had all the attraction of novelty. The afternoon\r\nparade was at its height, and he was interested watching the\r\npromenaders. Never had he seen so many pretty girls. There were styles\r\nof beauty to suit every taste--blondes and brunettes. Tall, graceful,\r\naristocratic girls; short, plump, vivacious girls. Some had the grace of\r\nstately lilies, others the charm and fragrance of the full-blown rose.\r\nEach rivaled the other in chic of costume, all were merry and full of\r\nthe exuberance of youth. They passed in twos and threes and as Armitage\r\nwatched them, he wondered where his girl was--the one girl in the world!\r\nHe knew that she was in New York, and he also knew where her home was on\r\nFifth Avenue. Perhaps if he stayed there long enough, he would see her\r\ngo by.\r\n\r\nHe had not heard from Grace since they landed in Boston. He reviewed in\r\nhis mind all that had occurred since the wreck of the _Atlanta_, that\r\never-memorable night when, swimming for his life in the raging seas, he\r\nhad felt her limp body lying heavily on his left arm. Then came their\r\nlong sojourn together on Hope Island, a blissful dream rudely\r\ninterrupted by the untimely arrival of the _Saucy Polly_. Then their\r\nreturn to America. Even on the voyage home they were no longer the same\r\nto each other. In her new clothes, borrowed from the stewardess, she\r\nlooked quite different. He thought he detected more reserve in her\r\nmanner toward him. Then, when they arrived in Boston, her father was\r\nwaiting for her, and they left at once for New York--on a special train.\r\nHe couldn't follow. He had no money and refused to accept any from Mr.\r\nHarmon. He felt amply rewarded for all he had done when Grace smiled\r\nkindly at him as she shook hands and said good-by.\r\n\r\nWhen they had gone he tried to find work. For some days he was\r\nunsuccessful. Times were hard. Instead of employing new men, old hands\r\nwere everywhere being discharged by the hundreds. At first he thought of\r\ntaking to his old occupation, the sea, but he thought better of it. He\r\nhad had enough of seafaring to last him some time. Then, desperate, he\r\ntried to get anything. Men with nerve were needed in the iron\r\nconstruction work of a lofty sky-scraper. He didn't know much about the\r\nbusiness, but he did not mind the danger, and he was soon high in the\r\nair, astride a swinging iron beam, riveting bolts at a dizzy height and\r\nwith such frail support that the people in the street below turned pale\r\nfor fear he would fall. What did he care if a girder fell and he was\r\ndashed to pieces below? He laughed at danger, and performed feats that\r\nmade his fellow workmen gasp. This earned him good pay, and soon he had\r\nsaved enough to come to New York.\r\n\r\nWhy had he come to New York? Why had he given up good wages to come here\r\nwithout the certainty of finding work? Only one thing had attracted him\r\nhere--the same reason that attracts the moth to the flame. He knew it\r\nwas hopeless, but he could not resist the temptation of coming to the\r\nsame city where she was, breathing the same air she breathed and\r\nsecretly, at night, coming up to Fifth Avenue and standing for hours,\r\nwatching her windows until he was ordered to move on by a suspicious\r\npoliceman. Luckily he had found employment--the same kind of work that\r\nhe had done successfully in Boston. A sky-scraper was being erected on\r\nthe corner of Fifth Avenue and Forty-second Street, and he was sent to\r\nrivet the iron beams. That was how he came to be there that sunny\r\nafternoon.\r\n\r\nCuriously, he eyed the fashionably dressed promenaders as they passed\r\nby, chatting and laughing in polite conversation. There was no hostility\r\nin his attitude as he watched them. That feeling had died away. These\r\nmen and women with their fine clothes and polished manners appeared to\r\nhim to-day in a different light. There was a time when he would have\r\ncursed them as they haughtily brushed past him, but now the old\r\nanimosity had died away. The class hatred which he had nourished so long\r\nin his heart had undergone a change. These were her people, perhaps they\r\nwere her friends. Wistfully, he looked after them, wishing he could\r\nsummon up courage to boldly approach some one and ask how Grace was.\r\nEagerly he scanned the brilliant throng, hoping each instant to catch\r\nsight of her in the crowd, but he watched in vain. The beloved figure he\r\nwould have recognized a mile away did not appear.\r\n\r\nDisappointed, he turned once more to his task. It was already half-past\r\nfour. In thirty minutes more the whistle would blow. The men would quit\r\nwork and he would trudge over to the cheaper East Side, where he lived.\r\nHe had picked up his sledge-hammer and was about to resume work when he\r\nhappened to look up the Avenue. There she was at last, close at hand,\r\ncoming toward him. Involuntarily, he stepped back, and the heavy hammer\r\nfell from his nerveless grasp.\r\n\r\nGrace went by, dainty and _chic_, the cynosure of every eye on the\r\nAvenue. Men turned after her as she passed. Women stopped and pointed.\r\nBut, unconscious of, or indifferent to, the admiration she excited, Miss\r\nHarmon continued on her way home.\r\n\r\nArmitage gazed after her, as if petrified. His first impulse was to cry\r\nout, to run after her, to attract her attention. He stumbled forward and\r\nthen stopped. What right had he to accost her? She might resent it as an\r\nunwarrantable impertinence. It would humiliate and embarrass her to be\r\naddressed amid that fashionable throng by a common workman. It was\r\nenough that he had seen her--from a distance. That was all the happiness\r\nhe could reasonably expect. By the time he had reasoned with himself,\r\nGrace was out of sight.\r\n\r\nThat evening when Armitage reached his lodgings he found awaiting him a\r\nletter bearing the Boston postmark. Opening it, he saw it contained\r\nanother letter addressed to him and forwarded in care of the Boston\r\noffice of the owners of the _Saucy Polly_. Tearing open the envelope, he\r\nread as follows:\r\n\r\n  \"-- FIFTH AVENUE.\r\n\r\n     \"DEAR MR. ARMITAGE: If you happen to be in New York, I should be\r\n     glad if you could find it convenient to call at the above address.\r\n\r\n  \"Yours faithfully,\r\n  \"JOHN HARMON.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe town house of John Harmon was conspicuous for its size and beauty\r\neven on an avenue famous for its magnificent residences. With a frontage\r\nof a hundred feet facing Central Park, it was constructed entirely of\r\nFrench gray stone, Renaissance style, with turrets, gables, oriel\r\nwindows, elaborately carved stone loggias and balconies, tiled roofs and\r\nall the other architectural ornamentation of that picturesque period.\r\nSet back some distance from the road, it was surrounded by tastefully\r\nlaid-out grounds, with a handsome portico decorated by elaborate stone\r\ncarvings, and a driveway bordered with flower-beds, entrance to which\r\nwas made through ornamental gates of massive bronze.\r\n\r\nBeautiful from the exterior as was this railroad king's home, within it\r\nwas furnished with the lavish grandeur of a royal palace. All Europe had\r\nbeen ransacked to fill it with beautiful and costly art treasures. At\r\nthe back of the large entrance-hall, with its magnificent frescoed\r\nceilings, its satin hangings, marble pillars and stained-glass windows,\r\nwas a monumental staircase of pure Italian marble and graceful design\r\nwhich led to the reception-room and other apartments above. The stairway\r\nwas artistically decorated with marble statuary, trophies of arms and\r\npriceless tapestries. On the second floor were the famous art-galleries\r\nhung with paintings by the ancient and modern masters.\r\n\r\nIt was only on extraordinary occasions that visitors were afforded an\r\nopportunity to see all the art treasures which the house contained. For\r\nthe greater part of the year the pictures were not on view. To-day,\r\nhowever, was one of the rare exceptions. Mr. Harmon had thrown open his\r\nentire house in honor of the special event which he was celebrating.\r\n\r\nOutside the house, on Fifth Avenue, a crowd of people stood watching the\r\nlong string of carriages, automobiles and taxi-cabs in line before the\r\ngate. The day, although fine, was cold and windy and an awning had been\r\nstretched from the portico to the curb to protect the guests from the\r\nweather. The crowd of curious sightseers grew larger as each moment\r\nother cabs and automobiles dashed up. A mounted policeman prevented the\r\nspectators from pressing too close and kept the way open for regular\r\ntraffic, while Mr. Harmon's servants in powdered hair and knee-breeches\r\nreceived each newcomer.\r\n\r\n\"Gee! Get on to 'em guys wid der white wigs!\" cried out a cheeky boy.\r\n\r\n\"What's all the fuss about?\" inquired a bystander.\r\n\r\n\"Blessed if I know,\" replied the man curtly.\r\n\r\nA well-dressed woman stopped and watched the scene with interest.\r\n\r\n\"Whose house is that?\" she inquired of a policeman.\r\n\r\n\"John Harmon's, m'm,\" replied the officer of the law.\r\n\r\n\"The railroad man?\" she asked, with growing interest.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" answered her informant. \"Mr. Harmon's daughter was wrecked on the\r\n_Atlanta_, you know. She was reported drowned. Then they found her on a\r\ndesert island. She's home to-day and they're giving a reception to all\r\ntheir friends in honor of her return.\"\r\n\r\nIn the splendid reception-room facing the Avenue rich with its gold and\r\ncrimson furnishings, delicately frescoed ceilings, satin brocade\r\nhangings, priceless rugs, onyx tables and heavy red carpet, Grace was\r\nthe center of an excited throng of women. Each fresh arrival literally\r\nfought her way through the crowd to get a glimpse of the heroine of the\r\nhour. There were murmurs of surprise and admiration on all sides as they\r\ncaught sight of her.\r\n\r\nThey expected to see Grace a physical wreck after all the suffering she\r\nhad gone through during her enforced imprisonment on the desert island.\r\nSome had gone so far as to whisper that the young heiress would never\r\nrecover from the effects of the nervous shock. Such a terrible\r\nexperience, they said, was more than sufficient to kill a strong woman.\r\nWhat effect, therefore, must it have had on the delicate Miss Harmon,\r\nwhose health already gave cause for alarm before she went on that fatal\r\nvoyage?\r\n\r\nWhen the invited guests entered the reception-room and saw Grace beaming\r\nand smiling in the center of a circle of enthusiastic friends they\r\ncould scarcely believe their eyes. To their utter astonishment she was\r\nprecisely the opposite of what they had imagined. Instead of the frail,\r\nlanguid girl to whom they had said good-by when the _Atlanta_ sailed\r\nfrom New York some six months before, she was the picture of good\r\nhealth, in as perfect physical condition as she had ever been in her\r\nlife. Her face was tanned from long exposure to the sun, but the deeper\r\ncolor only heightened the rich effects of her beauty. It became her dark\r\nhair and her splendid eyes. She was a little stouter, but her fuller\r\nfigure only set off to better advantage a new gown of clinging silver\r\ncloth, trimmed with rare lace. She looked radiant. Whispered murmurs of\r\nadmiration were heard in all parts of the room. The women raved about\r\nher figure, her coloring and her hair, and the men fell over each other\r\nin their eagerness to attract her attention.\r\n\r\nThe reception-rooms were already crowded and new arrivals were coming in\r\nconstantly. Somebody said that Prince Sergius of Eurasia was present,\r\nand there was a general craning of necks to get a glimpse of royalty. A\r\nwoman whispered confidentially to a friend that his royal highness had\r\nbeen a constant caller since Miss Harmon's return and that there were\r\ngood grounds for believing that they were engaged. In a few minutes the\r\nfriend had spread the information all over the room that the engagement\r\nwas official and would immediately be made public.\r\n\r\nSupremely unconscious of the gossip of which she was the envied object,\r\nGrace stood in a corner of the room surrounded by Mrs. Wesley Stuart,\r\nProfessor Hanson, Mrs. Phelps, and the Hon. Percy Fitzhugh. All fellow\r\nsurvivors of the wreck of the _Atlanta_, they made an interesting little\r\ngroup by themselves as they stood comparing notes and describing their\r\nadventures, while Mr. and Mrs. Harmon, scarcely able yet to believe the\r\ngood news that their darling child had returned from the dead, went from\r\none to another telling the wonderful story of her life on a desert\r\nisland.\r\n\r\nFor the hundredth time Grace told and retold the story of the wreck--how\r\nshe fell into the water from the overturned life-boat, and after\r\nswimming some distance, was fast becoming exhausted when suddenly one\r\nof the crew seized her and dragged her ashore. She told of her horrible\r\nadventure with the cobra and narrated in detail all the other incidents\r\nof her sojourn on the desert island up to the time that she was rescued\r\nby the _Saucy Polly_.\r\n\r\nMrs. Stuart explained how she and Professor Hanson, together with Mr.\r\nFitzhugh got away in one of the life-boats. Mrs. Phelps and Count von\r\nHatzfeldt were also saved, but poor Captain Summers was drowned, a\r\nmartyr to duty. He refused to leave the bridge and went down with his\r\nship, keeping the whistle blowing as the vessel sank out of sight\r\nbeneath the waves. After rowing all night they were picked up the\r\nfollowing day by a P. and O. steamer bound from Calcutta to Southampton.\r\nThey naturally supposed Grace was among the drowned, and, on arriving in\r\nEngland, gave her name among the others to the correspondents, who\r\ncabled the sensational news to New York.\r\n\r\nMrs. Stuart threw her arms around Grace's neck and kissed her\r\neffusively.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my poor, dear girl,\" she cried. \"If you only knew what mental\r\nagonies I've suffered! I thought that I should never see you again. I\r\nblamed myself for having suggested the voyage. I held myself\r\nresponsible. I did not dare look your poor father in the face. Your\r\nmental suffering must have been terrible, to say nothing of the dangers\r\nyou were subjected to. How terrified you must have been to be all alone\r\nwith that dreadful stoker! You should thank heaven he did you no\r\nviolence. A man of that character is capable of anything--especially\r\nwhen alone with a defenceless woman.\"\r\n\r\nGrace smiled faintly. A thoughtful expression came into her face. She\r\nmade no answer, and Mrs. Stuart repeated her question:\r\n\r\n\"Weren't you afraid of him?\"\r\n\r\nAroused from her reverie, Grace answered:\r\n\r\n\"No, not at all, we got along capitally. You know, dear,\" she went on,\r\n\"the devil is never as black as he is painted. When people don't get\r\nalong together, it is very often because they don't understand each\r\nother.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Stuart looked at her former _protegee_ with blank astonishment.\r\n\r\n\"So this stoker fellow--you think you understand him? Did you actually\r\ntake the trouble to understand him?\"\r\n\r\nShe looked closely at Grace, a searching look that made the latter's\r\ncheeks redden.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps,\" went on Mrs. Stuart, with a knowing smile, \"you both came to\r\na perfect understanding--some foolish romance which you'd blush now to\r\nacknowledge.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't be silly, Cora,\" answered Grace quickly. \"You know he saved my\r\nlife twice. The least I could do was to be civil to him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is he now?\" demanded Mrs. Stuart.\r\n\r\n\"I haven't the slightest idea,\" replied Grace. \"He returned to America,\r\nof course, on the _Saucy Polly_, and when the ship arrived at Boston my\r\nfather was there to meet me. When I had said what he had done for me,\r\nfather was anxious to repay him, but he refused to take anything and\r\nmysteriously disappeared. I have not seen him since, but we are trying\r\nto trace him. Father has written to the owner of the _Saucy Polly_,\r\nwhom, we think, knows his whereabouts.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perfectly delicious!\" exclaimed Mrs. Stuart sarcastically. \"Your father\r\ncan offer him a position as coachman, footman or butler. No doubt he's\r\ndead in love with you! The romance wouldn't be complete unless you\r\neloped with him!\"\r\n\r\nGrace was silent. Her friend's cynicism grated on her. She turned her\r\nhead away afraid that the expression on her face might betray her. How\r\noften she thought words uttered in jest hit upon the truth! She did not\r\ntell Mrs. Stuart that she was just as anxious to have news of Armitage\r\nas was her father. Strangely enough, her return home, which she thought\r\nwould fill her with joy, had failed to give her all the happiness she\r\nexpected. Once more she was enjoying the social prestige, all the\r\nluxuries that her father's position and money secured for her, yet there\r\nwere moments when she missed those days on Hope Island when her greatest\r\nambition was to prepare a satisfactory meal for her companion's return.\r\n\r\nShe wondered if she would ever see him again. She knew why he had\r\ndisappeared. He understood that there could never be anything between\r\nthem. They belonged to different worlds. She had returned to hers; he\r\nto his. She would not have expected anything else of him. She would have\r\nbeen disappointed in him if he had done anything else. He was not the\r\nkind of man to come round, hat in hand, and ask payment for his\r\nservices. No matter how poor he might be, he was too proud for that, and\r\nsecretly in her heart she rejoiced to think that the man she cared for\r\nwas of that stamp.\r\n\r\nOf course, their little love-affair was a thing of the past. When she\r\nthought of it she felt inclined to laugh, it was so preposterously out\r\nof keeping with her social position. Probably she would never see him\r\nagain. She would try not to, because, secretly, she was afraid of\r\nherself. She was afraid that if she saw him again and heard his voice,\r\nif ever again he spoke to her as he had on that island, she would be\r\ntempted to throw herself into his arms, no matter what her position or\r\nhow it might wreck her future. She remembered the story Professor Hanson\r\nhad told her of a girl of good family marrying an Indian. She recalled\r\nthe stories she had seen in the papers of rich girls running away with\r\ntheir coachmen. She could understand those things now. There was\r\nsomething in these men, some strange magnetic power, that made girls\r\nlove them for themselves, regardless of the disastrous consequences.\r\n\r\nMr. Harmon was listening with rapture to the flattering comments on all\r\nsides, on his daughter's improved appearance, when suddenly the English\r\nbutler approached him and said quietly:\r\n\r\n\"May I speak to you a minute, Sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Hawkins, what is it?\" answered Mr. Harmon impatiently.\r\n\r\n\"There's some one down-stairs to see you, Sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Some one to see me?\" echoed Mr. Harmon. \"Go and tell him to come\r\nup--like all the rest.\"\r\n\r\nThe butler did not budge. He had been in service boy and man for over\r\nforty years, and he thought he knew what kind of people were privileged\r\nto enter his master's home as guests.\r\n\r\n\"Didn't you hear me?\" repeated Mr. Harmon. \"Go and tell him to come up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me, Sir--it is not a visitor, Sir. It's a person who tried to\r\ncome in the front way, shovin' and elbowin' 'is way in along with the\r\nguests as if 'ee was a regular caller, sir. The policeman collared 'im,\r\nthinkin' 'ee was up to no good. You can never tell, sir. Sometimes\r\nthey're arter the coats and umbrellas, sir. But the feller said you 'ad\r\nwritten him, sir, to come 'ere. So the policeman let 'im go. But we\r\nwouldn't let him come in the front way, Sir. We hustled 'im in through\r\nthe tradesmen's entrance, and 'ee's down-stairs now. James is lookin'\r\narter the silver, Sir, so there ain't no danger, there, Sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's that?\" exclaimed Mr. Harmon. \"A person of that description says\r\nthat I wrote him to come here. He must be an impostor. Throw him\r\nout--have him arrested.\"\r\n\r\nThe butler gave a grin of self-satisfaction. Rubbing his hands, he said:\r\n\r\n\"That's wot I thought, Sir. Leave 'im to me, Sir. We'll take care of\r\n'im, Sir.\"\r\n\r\nHe was about to retire when Mr. Harmon suddenly had an idea.\r\n\r\n\"Can it possibly be----\" he muttered to himself. \"It must be he.\"\r\nTurning to the butler he went on: \"Here, Hawkins, don't say a word to\r\nany one--particularly not to my daughter. Take the man to my library.\r\nI'll be down at once.\"\r\n\r\nAstonished, and also hurt, that his employer should have acquaintances\r\nwhose appearance necessitated their being ushered in through the\r\ntradesman's entrance, the butler withdrew.\r\n\r\nAfter greeting a few more arrivals and responding to a toast to his\r\ndaughter in a glass of champagne, at the buffet-table besieged by a\r\nhungry and noisy crowd, Mr. Harmon slipped away unobserved and made his\r\nway to the library.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Harmon entered the room, he saw a man, tall, square-shouldered,\r\nroughly dressed, standing with his back to the door. The stranger was so\r\nbusy in admiring contemplation of a fine full-length oil-painting of the\r\nrailroad magnate's daughter which adorned the mantelpiece that he did\r\nnot hear any one enter. Mr. Harmon coughed, and the man turned quickly.\r\nIt was Armitage.\r\n\r\nThe light in the room was not good, and for a moment Mr. Harmon could\r\nnot distinguish his caller's features. At first he was in doubt as to\r\nhis identity.\r\n\r\n\"You wished to see me, Sir,\" he began. \"You are Mr.--Mr.----?\"\r\n\r\n\"Jack Armitage is my name,\" the other replied carelessly. Quickly he\r\nadded: \"I did not seek this interview, Mr. Harmon. You wrote asking me\r\nto call.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Harmon advanced cordially and extended his hand.\r\n\r\n\"To be sure--to be sure. Sit down, Mr. Armitage. You happen to have\r\ncalled on a very busy day. We're having some friends to see us.\"\r\n\r\nDespite his efforts to appear cordial, there was a certain embarrassment\r\nin the magnate's manner which his visitor was not slow to observe.\r\n\r\n\"So I noticed,\" he replied dryly. \"The policeman outside didn't size me\r\nup as being a friend of yours, so he promptly ran me in. I insisted that\r\nyou had asked me to call and he let me go. Then your cockney butler took\r\nme for a suspicious character, and after letting me enter, under\r\nprotest, through the tradesmen's entrance, he set the footman to watch\r\nme while he went to find you up-stairs.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Harmon laughed.\r\n\r\n\"Servants judge only by appearances,\" he said. \"If you'd driven up in a\r\ncarriage and pair, they'd have received you with every mark of honor.\r\nI'm sorry if they hurt your feelings.\"\r\n\r\nArmitage shrugged his shoulders and gave a little bitter laugh.\r\n\r\n\"What do I care for such jackals? I'm accustomed to that kind of thing.\r\nWell, I won't keep you, Mr. Harmon. You asked me to call. What can I do\r\nfor you?\"\r\n\r\nThe railroad man was taken aback. Yet he liked the man's independent\r\nspirit. Hastily he said:\r\n\r\n\"You mean what can I do for you. I sent for you because we could not\r\nallow you to go away like that. Do you suppose that I, John Harmon,\r\nwould permit the man who saved my daughter to go unrewarded?\"\r\n\r\nArmitage shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"I want nothing,\" he said curtly.\r\n\r\n\"You want nothing?\" echoed Mr. Harmon in surprise, looking his caller up\r\nand down from head to foot. \"Are your circumstances such that you are in\r\nneed of nothing?\"\r\n\r\nArmitage laughed bitterly.\r\n\r\n\"I need so much that I need nothing. It sounds like a paradox, but it's\r\nthe truth.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Harmon looked at him in surprise.\r\n\r\n\"You weren't always so low down in the world?\"\r\n\r\nArmitage made no reply.\r\n\r\n\"You're an educated man. That I can tell from your speech. Some\r\nmisfortune--some folly has brought you where you are.\"\r\n\r\nArmitage gave an impatient gesture and, moving toward the door, said:\r\n\r\n\"I didn't come here to discuss my affairs, Mr. Harmon. You sent for me.\r\nI thought you needed me. Good afternoon.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Harmon intercepted him.\r\n\r\n\"Wait a minute, young man. Don't be so hasty. I meant no offence. Don't\r\nyou see that I am interested in you? I want to help you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I ask help of no one,\" replied Armitage doggedly.\r\n\r\n\"Twice you saved my daughter's life. She and I can never forget what we\r\nowe you. She wants to thank you herself again. She could not understand\r\nyour disappearance and silence. Why did you not come?\"\r\n\r\nArmitage was silent a moment, and then he said:\r\n\r\n\"What was the use? I don't belong here. I didn't wish to embarrass you.\r\nCan't you see that? I saw Miss Harmon the other day. She was walking on\r\nFifth Avenue. She didn't see me. Why should she? I was working on a job\r\nclose by. She happened to pass just as I was about to quit work. I\r\nlooked at her, but she didn't see me. Even if she did, she wouldn't want\r\nto recognize me in these togs. I know that. I don't blame her.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't know my daughter,\" exclaimed Mr. Harmon enthusiastically.\r\n\"She is the last girl in the world to act like that. If she had seen\r\nyou, she would have been the first to extend her hand. I'm a self-made\r\nman myself,\" he added proudly. \"There's nothing snobbish about me, and I\r\nhope there isn't about my daughter. You'll come up-stairs with me now\r\nand be introduced to everybody as the man who saved her.\"\r\n\r\nArmitage shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"No--it isn't you--it's the world. It's not ourselves--it's because\r\nwe're afraid of what the world, our neighbors, will think. No, I\r\nwouldn't embarrass your daughter. Besides, I've no wish to be put on\r\nexhibition.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Harmon, puzzled, scratched his head.\r\n\r\n\"Well, what can we do to show our gratitude? Let me give you a little\r\npresent.\"\r\n\r\nHe took out his check-book, and, sitting down, wrote an order to bearer\r\nfor $10,000.\r\n\r\n\"Here, Mr. Armitage. This is far cheaper than I value my daughter. But\r\nit will make life easy for you. You can start some business--be\r\npractically independent for life. Here, my boy, take it with a father's\r\ngratitude.\"\r\n\r\nHe passed the check over to Armitage, who looked at it a moment. A smile\r\npassed over his face and slowly, deliberately, he tore it into tiny\r\npieces.\r\n\r\n\"What are you doing?\" cried Mr. Harmon.\r\n\r\n\"I can't take your money for taking care of her, Mr. Harmon. I should\r\nforever despise myself if I did. It would be bad luck to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what can I do for you? I can't let you go like that!\"\r\n\r\nArmitage remained silent. Then, turning suddenly, he said:\r\n\r\n\"There's only one thing I could accept from you, Mr. Harmon.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is that?\" demanded the railroad magnate eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"Something that even you, rich as you are, cannot give me. You wouldn't\r\ngive it me if you could. Good day, Mr. Harmon.\"\r\n\r\nArmitage went out and, as he passed the astonished financier, he gave a\r\nlast lingering look at the oil portrait which filled the space over the\r\nmantel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a cheap, grimy-looking hash-house on Third Avenue Armitage sat alone\r\nat a table, partaking with apparent relish of the rough yet not\r\nunwholesome fare which his slender purse could afford to pay for. The\r\nhour being late, he had exclusively to himself the services of the one\r\ngreasy and cadaverous waiter, while the proprietor of the restaurant, if\r\nthe \"joint\" might be dignified by so respectable a name, sat behind his\r\nrostrum near the window, sulkily reckoning up the day's receipts.\r\n\r\nThrough the open door came all the distressing sounds and smells that\r\nmake this particular thoroughfare the noisiest and most objectionable of\r\nthe city's main arteries. Overhead the elevated trains crashed with\r\ndeafening noise, push-cart vendors shouted their wares, Italian\r\norgan-grinders played discordant tunes, smudged-faced, tattered children\r\nromped in the unclean gutters, slovenly housewives quarreled with cranky\r\njanitors, a drunkard staggered in bestial condition from a corner\r\nsaloon, roughly moved on by a uniformed bully with swinging club;\r\nsinister figures of men and women, human derelicts, crouched in\r\ndoorways, pavements and sidewalks were filthy with torn paper and\r\ndecaying fruit, tattered washing hanging from broken-down\r\nfire-escapes--everything that is degraded and sordid was centered here\r\nright in the heart of the richest and most modern city in the world.\r\n\r\nBut Armitage was too busily preoccupied to be disturbed by his squalid\r\nsurroundings. His appetite was keen, thanks to a day's hard work, and,\r\nwhile he devoured with amazing celerity the contents of his heaped-up\r\nplate, he stopped every now and then to read with closer attention the\r\nnewspaper which was propped up before him. It was a torn copy of that\r\nmorning's _Tribune_, and the part which interested him was an account on\r\nthe society page of the big reception which had taken place at the\r\nresidence of Mr. John Harmon on the previous day. It being a social\r\nevent of some importance, two columns were devoted to it, the writer\r\nexplaining the special occasion which it was intended to celebrate, and\r\nretelling in vivid detail the story of the _Atlanta_'s ill-fated\r\nvoyage. Armitage smiled as he read the account, sensationally\r\nexaggerated, of the beautiful young heiress' hairbreadth escapes from\r\nangry ocean and venomous serpent and all the other terrors of a desert\r\nisland in company with a common sailor, who, when the rescue-party\r\nsafely reached America, strangely disappeared despite the grateful\r\nrailroad man's tireless efforts to discover his whereabouts and reward\r\nhim. Then the article went on to tell of Miss Harmon's improved\r\nappearance, the delight of her friends, and to describe the wonderful\r\ngowns worn by the fashionable women who had thronged to welcome her\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nHe was reading the article in a careless, amused kind of way when\r\nsuddenly he came to a paragraph which made him sit up with a start. It\r\nread as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"But perhaps the chief interest of the afternoon, apart from the\r\n     charming young heroine, centred in a distinguished guest, Prince\r\n     Sergius of Eurasia. His Royal Highness has been a frequent caller\r\n     at the Harmon residence ever since Miss Harmon's return, and, as\r\n     usual, gossip has been busy trying to find some plausible\r\n     explanation of this growing intimacy between the heir presumptive\r\n     to a European throne, and the family of an American railroad king.\r\n     It is whispered that Miss Harmon, whose marriage has been the\r\n     topic of the last two seasons, is not indifferent to the Prince,\r\n     and that if the consent of the King can be obtained, the\r\n     engagement of the young couple will be shortly announced.\"\r\n\r\nA lump rose in Armitage's throat. Calling for a cup of coffee, he lit\r\nhis pipe and took up the paper again. After all, he thought\r\nphilosophically, why should he care? The girl was lost to him, that was\r\ncertain. He would never see her again. She was a bit of sunshine that\r\nhad suddenly burst into his dark, unhappy life; and suddenly gone again,\r\nleaving the outlook blacker than ever. He knew it was hopeless. He loved\r\nher, would always love her. Time would make no difference. She would\r\nmarry her prince and have long forgotten her adventure on the island,\r\nand still he, knocking alone about the world, would cherish her memory\r\nin his heart.\r\n\r\nHe did not blame her. It was different in her case. On the island, alone\r\nwith him, she might in time have learned to care for him. They might\r\nhave been happy together, far happier than she would ever be in her\r\nEurasian palace. But when the spell was once broken, when she returned\r\nto New York and was once more absorbed in her fashionable life, it was\r\nonly natural that she should speedily forget him.\r\n\r\nHe threw the newspaper down and, having settled his bill, was about to\r\nrise and leave, when suddenly his eye was arrested by an advertisement\r\nhe saw in the paper which he had just put aside. Picking it up again, he\r\nread as follows:\r\n\r\n     ARMITAGE: If John Armitage, second son of Sir William Armitage, of\r\n     Alnwick Towers, Bucks, England, will communicate at once with the\r\n     undersigned he will learn something to his advantage. Coxe and\r\n     Willoughby, attorneys, 27 Broad Street, N. Y. City.\r\n\r\nHis heart beating furiously, he read the advertisement over and over.\r\nJohn Armitage, second son of Sir William Armitage of Alnwick Towers,\r\nBucks, England--what a familiar sound that had! Many long weary years\r\nhad gone by since he had seen those names in print. What could have\r\nhappened! Why should they want to communicate with him--the scapegrace\r\nof the family? He turned pale. Could his father be dead--the father who\r\nhad cursed him and forbade him ever to appear before him again? Even if\r\nhe were dead they would not send for him. His elder brother would\r\nsucceed to the title and estates.\r\n\r\nLetting the paper drop out of his hands, he rose and, leaving the place,\r\nwalked along Third Avenue as if in a dream. Coxe and Willoughby, 27\r\nBroad Street! Well, there was no harm in calling on them to see what\r\nthey wanted. Their offices would be closed now, but he would go first\r\nthing in the morning. The dull roar of the city's tremendous traffic,\r\nthe clanging of car-gongs, the hoarse cries of news vendors greeted him\r\nas he stemmed the tide of pushing humanity, men and women toilers--the\r\nday's work ended--all hurrying to trains and ferries. A wagon driven at\r\nreckless speed round a corner nearly knocked him down as he crossed a\r\nstreet. A fellow workman loafing at the entrance to a saloon jocularly\r\ninvited him to enter and take a drink. But he paid no heed. He strode\r\nalong, walking as on air, his thoughts far away.\r\n\r\nThe advertisement he had just read had taken him back fifteen years. He\r\nsaw himself in England, just graduated from College, receiving the\r\ncongratulations of his friends. He remembered his father's pride in his\r\nsuccess and his kindly admonition to continue as he had begun, so that\r\none day he might add even more distinction to the honorable name he\r\nbore. How had he followed that sage advice? No sooner released from the\r\nrestraint of the University than he plunged into every form of\r\ndissipation, sowing his wild oats recklessly, blindly, utterly\r\nindifferent to the deadly crop they might one day yield. The corrupt,\r\ngay city beckoned to him, and he could not resist its pleasure-call. He\r\nscattered gold right and left on race-tracks, at cards, on women. A\r\nsmall inheritance turned over at his majority went speedily the way of\r\nall the rest, and then he went to the money-lenders to pay for further\r\nextravagances, incurring obligations he could not meet. Sir William,\r\nsorely disappointed, came to the rescue again and again, and, extracting\r\na promise of reformation, made him enter Woolwich to try for a\r\ncommission in the Army. Plucked at every examination, he was quickly\r\ndiscouraged, returned to his fast companions and gradually drifted into\r\nthe aimless, loose way of living of the idle man-about-town. Debts\r\naccumulated, the creditors dunned and dogged his footsteps until life\r\nbecame unbearable. His father, incensed beyond hope of pardon, turned a\r\ndeaf ear to further appeals, and finally cut off his allowance\r\naltogether, hoping to teach him a lesson. Soon his clothes got shabby,\r\nhe was forced into cheap lodgings, his fair-weather friends forgot to\r\nbow to him.\r\n\r\nThat was the beginning of the end. He drifted lower and lower until he\r\nwas forced to go to work or starve. He knew no trade. He was obliged to\r\naccept what he could get. He turned his hand to anything, often making\r\nbarely enough to secure himself a night's lodging. Finally, when things\r\nseemed at their darkest, he heard there was a demand for stokers on the\r\nBlue Star Line. What he had suffered down there in that hell's furnace\r\nno man knew! The poor devils who had to do the work never survived to\r\ntell of their devilish toil. If these millionaires who liked to travel\r\nin fast ships knew the physical agony the vessel's speed cost a human\r\nbeing, they would refuse to patronize them. Thank God those days were\r\nover! No matter what happened, he would never go back to the\r\nstoke-hold.\r\n\r\nThat night as he lay on his cot in his Bowery lodging-house he tossed\r\nuneasily, unable to sleep, wondering what Coxe & Willoughby, Attorneys,\r\nof 27 Broad Street, wanted with him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\n\r\nBroad Street, just before the stock-market begins its daily orgy of\r\nfrenzied finance, is perhaps the most orderly and imposing of any of the\r\nsplendid thoroughfares in New York's commercial center. Strange to say,\r\nit also fits its name, having almost three times the width of any other\r\nstreet in the down-town district. From the Wall Street end where the\r\nSub-Treasury faces the old-fashioned premises of J. Pierpont Morgan &\r\nCo.'s banking-house, Broad Street sweeps round in a noble curve, lined\r\non either side with stately office-buildings, rivaling each other in\r\nbeauty of architectural design. The imposing building opposite\r\nornamented with bas reliefs and noble marble columns is the Stock\r\nExchange, where the unsophisticated lamb is ruthlessly sheared by bull\r\nand bear, and farther on, without other roof than the blue vault of\r\nheaven, are the noisy curb brokers, so called because, having no\r\nbuilding of their own in which to transact their business, they are\r\npermitted by time-honored custom to trade in a roped-off enclosure in\r\nthe middle of the street.\r\n\r\nIt was absolutely terra incognita to Armitage, and he gazed open-eyed\r\naround him like any country yokel seeing the sights of the city for the\r\nfirst time. Suddenly he saw a crowd of men engaged in what seemed to be\r\na desperate struggle in the middle of the road. They were grappling with\r\neach other, brandishing their arms and fists, yelling like Indians. It\r\nlooked like a riot of serious proportions, and he wondered why the\r\npoliceman who stood close by calmly looking on viewed it with such\r\nunconcern.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter?\" he queried of a passer-by.\r\n\r\n\"Matter--where?\" asked the stranger, looking in all directions.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you see those men fighting?\" said Armitage.\r\n\r\nThe stranger grinned.\r\n\r\n\"Say, you're from Jersey, ain't you? That's no fight. They're curb\r\nbrokers trying to unload on each other their mining stocks.\"\r\n\r\nArmitage felt foolish. To hide his confusion he asked:\r\n\r\n\"Can you direct me to the offices of Coxe and Willoughby, the attorneys?\r\nI'm a stranger here.\"\r\n\r\nThe man pointed a little farther up the street.\r\n\r\n\"See that tall building on the left? That's it.\"\r\n\r\nThanking his informant Armitage hurried on, and, going up the stone\r\nsteps of No. 27, passed through a revolving door kept whirling by an\r\nendless procession of brokers, clerks and messenger-boys who hurried in\r\nand out. Following a long corridor, he came to a large open space\r\ncompletely lined with elevators. Some were expresses which made no stop\r\nbelow the 25th floor; the rest were locals stopping at each story, on\r\nrequest.\r\n\r\n\"Coxe and Willoughby?\" he said interrogatively to the uniformed starter.\r\n\r\n\"Twenty-seventh floor. Take the express,\" was the quick reply.\r\n\r\nArmitage entered the waiting car. Other persons followed him in, and it\r\nwas comfortably filled when the starter cried sharply:\r\n\r\n\"Right!\"\r\n\r\nInstantly the attendant closed the gates and touched a lever. Armitage\r\nfelt his stomach leap into his throat. They were flying upward at a\r\nspeed of fifty miles an hour, and before he had time to gasp, the car\r\nhad reached the first stop, nearly 300 feet up in the air. Two stories\r\nmore and he had reached the floor he wanted.\r\n\r\n\"Along the corridor to your left, first door to the right,\" shouted the\r\nelevator man.\r\n\r\nArmitage followed the handsome corridor with its marble walls, inlaid\r\nfloors and hard-wood finishing until he came to a glass door on which\r\nwas inscribed in bold black letters:\r\n\r\nCOXE AND WILLOUGHBY\r\n\r\nCounsellors at law\r\n\r\nHe opened the door, and found himself in an outer office in which behind\r\na rail were two foppish-looking clerks seated at desks. Neither of them\r\nmade an attempt to move when Armitage entered, but continued their\r\nanimated discussion of a game of baseball they had witnessed the\r\nprevious day. Armitage hit the rail lightly with his hand to attract\r\ntheir attention, and finally one of the clerks condescended to get up\r\nand come and ask what the caller wanted.\r\n\r\n\"I wish to see a member of the firm,\" said Armitage.\r\n\r\nThe clerk looked him over from head to toe. He had been trained to judge\r\npeople by their clothes, and there was something unconventional about\r\nArmitage's attire that appealed to his sense of humor. He turned to his\r\nfellow clerk and gave him the wink, whereupon the other laughed.\r\n\r\n\"In relation to what?\" he demanded, wondering what possible business\r\nthis ordinary workingman could have with his employer.\r\n\r\nArmitage was puzzled for a moment as to how he should announce himself.\r\nThen an idea occurred to him. Taking from his pocket the advertisement\r\nwhich he had clipped from the paper the night before, he handed it to\r\nthe clerk, saying:\r\n\r\n\"Say that a gentleman has called in answer to this advertisement.\"\r\n\r\n\"A 'gentleman,' did you say?\" demanded the clerk insolently.\r\n\r\nHe looked first at the advertisement and then at Armitage. A look of\r\nblank astonishment which came over his face was succeeded by one of\r\nutter incredulity. Leaving the rail, he went over to his fellow clerk\r\nand whispered something to him, and they both snickered.\r\n\r\nArmitage tried to be patient, but he was fast losing his temper. He did\r\nnot like the clerk's supercilious manner. In another minute he would\r\nvault over that rail, and some one's head would get punched. Finally he\r\nsaid impatiently:\r\n\r\n\"Are you going to take that in to a member of the firm or must I do it\r\nmyself?\"\r\n\r\nThe clerk looked up, and he was about to make some impertinent retort\r\nwhen he suddenly thought better of it. There was a look in Armitage's\r\neye that he did not like. Crossing the office, he disappeared through a\r\nglass door. A moment later he reappeared and, unfastening the rail gate,\r\nsaid in more respectful tones:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Willoughby will see you at once, sir.\"\r\n\r\nHe ushered him into a spacious, well-lighted and handsomely furnished\r\nroom. An elderly man of legal appearance was writing at a table littered\r\nwith documents. He rose as Armitage entered, and courteously waved him\r\nto a chair. In his hand he held the advertisement, and while he twisted\r\nit nervously in his fingers he scrutinized his caller closely through\r\nhis glasses.\r\n\r\n\"You wish to see me, Sir. What can I do for you?\" he began.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied Armitage quickly. \"You wished to see me. I came in answer\r\nto that advertisement.\"\r\n\r\nThe lawyer came nearer, and his scrutiny became keener.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes--I see. May I ask in what way this advertisement interests\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only that I'm John Armitage--that's all.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Willoughby started, and, taking out his handkerchief nervously,\r\nwiped his face. As much as any lawyer allows himself to show emotion, he\r\nbetrayed surprise. He came still closer and, peering into his visitor's\r\nface, said:\r\n\r\n\"You? _You_ are John Armitage?\"\r\n\r\nHe looked at his visitor's dress, noticed his clumsy thick-soled boots,\r\nsoiled jacket and trousers, and he shook his head incredulously.\r\n\r\n\"The world's full of impostors,\" he muttered to himself, \"but we lawyers\r\nare too much for them.\" Aloud he repeated: \"_You_ are John Armitage?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--I am John Armitage, formerly of Alnwick Tower, Bucks, England.\"\r\n\r\nHurrying back to his desk, the old lawyer opened a drawer and took from\r\nit a faded photograph. Holding it so that Armitage could not see it, he\r\nstood comparing the portrait with the living man before him.\r\n\r\n\"Same face!\" he murmured. \"Older--more serious expression, but same\r\nshaped head--same features.\" Aloud he added: \"If, as you say, you are\r\nJohn Armitage, you have, of course, some way of identifying yourself.\r\nYou see we have to be very careful.\"\r\n\r\nArmitage laughed.\r\n\r\n\"I don't happen to have a passport,\" he said. \"When I left England some\r\nfifteen years ago I didn't think I'd require one. But I've a mark on my\r\nleft arm, a rough tattooing of the Armitage crest, which I did in my\r\nfoolish boyhood days. And I have some letters which my mother wrote me\r\nafter I left home. Those I've treasured. I let everything else go, but\r\nher letters I kept.\" Placing his hand over his heart, he added: \"They're\r\nhere.\"\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Willoughby grew more and more interested he became more and more\r\nnervous.\r\n\r\n\"Let me see them,\" he said impatiently.\r\n\r\nArmitage opened his vest and drawing forth a small package of\r\nyellow-stained letters tied with a bit of ribbon, he handed them over.\r\n\r\n\"I guess we have no secrets from you,\" he said. \"You may read them.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Willoughby untied the package, opened a letter and glanced hurriedly\r\nat the handwriting and signature. Then he handed them back.\r\n\r\n\"That's enough,\" he cried. \"That's enough.\" Starting forward, he\r\nextended his hand.\r\n\r\n\"My dear Sir John--allow me to congratulate you!\"\r\n\r\nArmitage felt himself grow pale. He rose from his chair.\r\n\r\n\"You mean that my father----\" he exclaimed.\r\n\r\nThe lawyer looked grave.\r\n\r\n\"Your father, Sir William, is dead----\"\r\n\r\n\"But my elder brother, Charles?\" stammered Armitage. \"He succeeded to\r\nthe title and estates--not I.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your brother Charles,\" replied the lawyer solemnly, \"was killed in an\r\nautomobile accident five years ago.\"\r\n\r\nArmitage sank into a chair and burying his face in his hands burst into\r\ntears. That his father had died without forgiving him was bad enough,\r\nbut that Charlie, his old pal, should have died years ago without his\r\nknowing it, was terrible!\r\n\r\n\"Poor Charlie! Poor Charlie!\" he murmured.\r\n\r\n\"When your brother was dying,\" went on the lawyer, \"he summoned your\r\nheart-broken father to his bedside and made him promise to forgive you,\r\nto make every effort to discover your whereabouts, and to make a will in\r\nyour favor. They advertised for you in the London and colonial papers.\r\nWe advertised for you in the American papers. We received no answer. And\r\nnow your father has passed away. You are the sole heir. As the estates\r\nare entailed, you would have succeeded to the estates as a matter of\r\ncourse, but your father died forgiving you fully and leaving you\r\nsufficient income to keep up the title. Sir John, I again congratulate\r\nyou on succeeding to an old and honored title and an income of little\r\nless than $100,000 a year.\"\r\n\r\nArmitage listened like a man who is dazed. It had all come so suddenly\r\nthat he thought he must be dreaming.\r\n\r\n\"When did my father die--of what?\" he asked in a low tone.\r\n\r\n\"Of heart failure--three weeks ago,\" was the rejoinder. \"We've been\r\ntrying to find you ever since. They followed you as far as the London\r\ndocks, and then all trace of you was lost. Where have you been all these\r\nyears?\"\r\n\r\nThe lawyer noted his new client's sun-tanned face, and he looked askance\r\nat his workman's dress.\r\n\r\n\"Knocking about the world--trying to forget things,\" replied Armitage.\r\n\r\nMr. Willoughby shook his head as he said:\r\n\r\n\"Young men will do foolish things! Well, you've had your lesson. Perhaps\r\nyou'll be a better man for the hard time you've had. The past is dead\r\nand forgotten. A bright future is before you. What do you propose to do\r\nnow?\"\r\n\r\nArmitage seemed lost in thought.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. I haven't had time to think.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you any ties here? Are you married?\"\r\n\r\nArmitage smiled.\r\n\r\n\"No, who would have me--a pauper?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Willoughby carefully adjusted his spectacles and said decisively:\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, you had better start for England at once and take\r\npossession of your property under the will and entail. There will be a\r\nnumber of legal formalities to go through. I will advise our London\r\noffice that you are coming. This is Tuesday. Could you sail on the\r\n_Florida_ next Saturday?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can,\" replied Armitage quickly.\r\n\r\nThe lawyer went to his desk and sat down to write. A moment later he\r\nreturned with a piece of paper in his hand. Holding it out, he said:\r\n\r\n\"Of course you can't go dressed as you are. Here's a check for $1,000.\r\nIt will pay your passage and your immediate needs. When you arrive in\r\nEngland, you can, of course, draw on our London office for all you\r\nwant. You had better hurry now to book your passage and buy some\r\nclothes, and this evening if you have nothing else to do I shall be\r\ndelighted if you'll dine with me at the Union League Club.\"\r\n\r\nHe touched a bell, and the supercilious clerk entered. By the sneer on\r\nhis face, he evidently expected that he had been summoned to eject the\r\nrough-looking visitor. To his astonishment, he saw his employer shaking\r\nhands with him.\r\n\r\nMr. Willoughby accompanied Armitage into the outer office.\r\n\r\n\"Good-by, Sir John,\" he said cordially. \"I'm delighted to have made your\r\nacquaintance. Don't forget to-night. Union League Club, at 7 o'clock.\"\r\n\r\nThe two clerks nearly swooned from amazement and consternation. As\r\nArmitage went down in the elevator he pinched himself to find out if he\r\nwas awake.\r\n\r\nWhen he emerged into Broad Street he was surprised to find how different\r\neverything looked to him. The world had suddenly taken on another\r\naspect. The sunshine seemed brighter. Every man and woman he met seemed\r\nmore amiable and friendly. The whole world seemed gayer, more joyous. He\r\nfelt within him a strange novel sensation of exhilaration. His\r\nmoodiness, his pessimism had disappeared. He felt imbued with new life\r\nand energy, as if he could go forth and conquer a world. From less than\r\nnothing to a title and $100,000 a year is a jump big enough to daze any\r\nman.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he thought of Grace. If only he had received this news a few\r\nweeks before! Things might have been very different. Well, what was the\r\nuse of torturing himself any longer? She was lost to him now--no matter\r\nhow changed his circumstances and position.\r\n\r\nHe stood still, at the edge of the curb, irresolute, not knowing what to\r\ndo next. Putting his hand in his pocket to feel if the check was still\r\nthere, he drew it out to look at it. It was drawn on the Chemical Bank\r\nand payable to bearer. A thousand dollars! He had never seen so much\r\nmoney in his life. It was a question if they wouldn't arrest him as a\r\nsuspicious character when he presented it for payment. However, there\r\nwas no time to be lost. He must get the check cashed at once, buy an\r\noutfit and secure his steamship passage.\r\n\r\nAfter some difficulty he found the Chemical Bank, opposite the\r\nPost-Office. It was a splendid building with a lofty dome of stained\r\nglass, reminding him of a church. Making his way to the paying-teller's\r\nwindow, he handed in the check. The teller, a gaunt, keen-eyed man with\r\nspectacles, looked first at the check and then at Armitage. The latter's\r\nappearance did not seem to fit the amount of money the check called for,\r\nand a suspicious look came over his face. Eyeing the bearer severely, he\r\ndemanded sternly:\r\n\r\n\"Where did you get this?\"\r\n\r\n\"From the man who drew it, of course,\" replied Armitage coolly. \"Let me\r\nhave it in fifties and hundreds!\"\r\n\r\nInstead of complying with the request, the teller quickly touched an\r\nelectric bell. It was evidently a signal, for instantly a special\r\npoliceman attached to the Bank came up and took up a position near\r\nArmitage. He made no attempt to interfere, but just remained on hand in\r\ncase he was wanted. Meantime the teller was already in telephonic\r\ncommunication with Coxe and Willoughby.\r\n\r\n\"Is this Coxe and Willoughby?\" asked the teller.\r\n\r\n\"This is Mr. Willoughby,\" came the answer.\r\n\r\n\"Have you drawn to-day a check for $1,000 payable to bearer?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have.\"\r\n\r\n\"What does the bearer look like?\"\r\n\r\n\"Tall, dark man, smooth face, dressed like a workingman. It's all\r\nright. Pay it at once. Good day.\"\r\n\r\nThat was enough. The teller returned to his little window. Dismissing\r\nthe uniformed attendant, he turned to Armitage and in a tone as if he\r\nhad never for a moment doubted the genuineness of the check, asked\r\nsuavely:\r\n\r\n\"Fifties and hundreds, I think you said, Sir.\"\r\n\r\nRapidly counting out the bills, he passed them through the little\r\nopening and turned to attend to the next man on the line.\r\n\r\nArmitage slowly folded up bills, a grim smile of satisfaction. He had\r\nenjoyed the situation hugely.\r\n\r\n\"Now for my steamship passage!\" he muttered to himself.\r\n\r\nTurning to the right as he re-entered Broadway, he walked about a mile\r\nin the direction of the Battery until he came to Bowling Green, where\r\nthe steamship companies have their offices. Conspicuous on the left-hand\r\nside were the palatial offices of the Blue Star Line. As he went up the\r\nimposing stone steps leading to the passenger booking-rooms, he thought\r\nbitterly under what different conditions he had last visited these\r\noffices. Then it was to sign articles as stoker on the _Atlanta_.\r\n\r\nHe entered the room devoted exclusively to first cabin business, and a\r\nclerk, quick to notice his shabby appearance, spoke up impatiently:\r\n\r\n\"Can't you read? This is first cabin. Steerage and second cabin on the\r\nother side of the hall.\"\r\n\r\nArmitage gave the clerk a look that made the latter wish he had left the\r\ncaller alone.\r\n\r\n\"Who asked you for any information?\" he demanded, pretending wrath he\r\ndid not feel.\r\n\r\n\"This is only first class,\" repeated the clerk peevishly, but not\r\nwithout feeling some respect to his interlocutor's massive shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"I don't care whether it's first class or tenth class,\" growled\r\nArmitage. \"Let me see the plan of the _Florida_.\"\r\n\r\nThe clerk gasped as he laid the plan before him.\r\n\r\n\"The lowest in this ship is $150 a berth--two in a room,\" he said, in a\r\ntone as if he expected this would quickly settle the matter.\r\n\r\n\"Two in a room--not for mine,\" said Armitage jovially. \"I want something\r\ncomfortable. How's this?\" he added, pointing to a berth.\r\n\r\n\"Single berth room--$400,\" said the clerk blandly.\r\n\r\n\"I'll take it,\" replied the new passenger. Peeling off four 100-dollar\r\nbills from the bank-roll, he threw them before the astonished clerk.\r\n\r\n\"What name, sir?\" he asked, more respectfully.\r\n\r\n\"Sir John Armitage.\"\r\n\r\nThe clerk's hand shook so with surprise and nervousness that he dropped\r\nthe book-plan on the floor.\r\n\r\nLeaving the steamship offices, Armitage proceeded along Broadway,\r\nchuckling. How sweet was the power of money! Now he would be able to\r\nwield this power, to enslave men as they had enslaved him. Yet in the\r\nmidst of this new-found joy, he knew there was something still lacking.\r\nHe was haunted by a pair of dark eyes, lips that had trembled with\r\npassion he alone had awakened. What good was his money, his new-found\r\npower, if it would not give him the woman he wanted. Engaged to that\r\nspendthrift princeling, she was entirely lost to him. She had sold\r\nherself, and he tried to persuade himself that he despised her for it.\r\n\r\nYet how could he go away without saying good-by? It was different when\r\neverything looked hopeless, when his social standing was immeasurably\r\nbeneath hers. He would never have subjected himself to a snub, and he\r\nhad avoided her for that reason. He knew it would pain her to snub him,\r\nyet she would be compelled to do so. It would only have meant more\r\nsuffering for him. But now it was different. He was more than her equal\r\nsocially. In fact, he was her social superior. He could not go away\r\nwithout saying good-by. There could never be anything between them. She\r\nwas going to marry the other fellow and satisfy her ambition to be a\r\nmember of a royal house. Yet for all that they were still good friends.\r\n\r\nHe wondered how he could see her. The best way probably was to write\r\nher a letter, telling her he was sailing immediately and asking for an\r\ninterview. He would say nothing about his accession to the title, but\r\njust that his condition had changed for the better. This revealed\r\nnothing, and yet would account for his better clothes and possession of\r\nfunds.\r\n\r\nA firm of ready-made clothiers speedily fitted him with a neat business\r\nsuit and furnished all the other things he required. When the\r\ntransformation was complete with a clean shave and hair cut, he did not\r\nrecognize himself in the mirror.\r\n\r\nThat night he took rooms at the Waldorf, and after enjoying a good\r\ndinner with Mr. Willoughby at the Union League Club, he returned to the\r\nhotel, sitting down in the reading-room, he wrote Grace a letter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\n\r\n  NEW YORK CITY, Tuesday.\r\n\r\n     DEAR MISS HARMON: You will perhaps consider this letter an\r\n     impertinence, and yet you may not--under the circumstances. When\r\n     the other day I called at your house, at your father's request,\r\n     Mr. Harmon asked me to go up-stairs to see you. It was impossible\r\n     for me at that time to accept his kind invitation. You will\r\n     understand why. Since then, however, a change for the better has\r\n     taken place in my affairs. The outlook is no longer so hopeless. I\r\n     am leaving America. I sail on Saturday.\r\n\r\n     I cannot go without saying good-by. I have read in the newspapers\r\n     about your coming marriage to the Prince of Eurasia. I sincerely\r\n     hope that this realization of your life's ambition will bring the\r\n     happiness you expect.\r\n\r\n     No matter what the future may have in store for me, the\r\n     recollection of those all too few weeks we spent alone in close\r\n     association on Hope Island will never grow dim in my memory. I can\r\n     never forget you or the dream of supreme happiness that I once\r\n     thought within my grasp. The signal fire is now dead and cold on\r\n     Mount Hope's lofty summit, but another flame as bright and fierce,\r\n     which you yourself kindled, will continue to blaze in my heart\r\n     while life endures. I know that you are forever lost to me, I know\r\n     that another will call you wife, yet night and day I am haunted by\r\n     the memory of that mad afternoon on the sun-kissed sands when,\r\n     almost crazed with passion, I seized you in my arms to take you\r\n     for my own. Then, all at once, came the rude awakening!\r\n\r\n     But all that is past and gone. I steel my heart to try and forget\r\n     what I had won and lost again. I will leave you in peace to enjoy\r\n     your new happiness. You will never see or hear from me after I\r\n     leave New York. Yet I would like to see you just once more, to\r\n     grasp your hand and wish you well. We were always friends, and for\r\n     one brief moment we were almost lovers. May I call on Thursday\r\n     afternoon?\r\n\r\n  Yours sincerely,\r\n  JOHN ARMITAGE.\r\n\r\nEnsconced in the big bay window of the library, comfortably propped up\r\nwith cushions, Grace sat gazing pensively over the tree tops of Central\r\nPark. In her hand was Armitage's letter, which she had read and reread a\r\ndozen times until she knew every word by heart. Close by, impatiently\r\ntossed against a chair, was a magnificent floral basket which Prince\r\nSergius had sent that morning. Attached to the basket by a white ribbon\r\nwas an envelope--unopened. The perfume from the flowers scented the\r\nentire room, but Grace seemed to be unconscious of their presence. She\r\nkept looking out of the window as if expecting each instant to see some\r\none appear on the Avenue. Every now and then she consulted her watch.\r\n\r\n\"Ten minutes past three!\" she murmured. \"I wrote that I should expect\r\nhim at three. Perhaps he never got my letter.\"\r\n\r\nA look of worry came over her face, and she was straining her eyes in an\r\neffort to distinguish far-away figures on the avenues when the door\r\nopened and her French maid entered. Grace looked up.\r\n\r\n\"What is it, Louise?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"Ze telephone, Mademoiselle. His Royal Highness want to know if you are\r\nat home.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you say I was home?\"\r\n\r\n\"_Mais non_, Mademoiselle. I said I would see if Mademoiselle was in.\"\r\n\r\nGrace left her place by the window and paced nervously up and down the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n\"Tell His Royal Highness that I'm out,\" she said. With a gesture of\r\nimpatience she added: \"Say I've gone out to dinner and won't be back\r\nuntil late. _Vous comprenez?_\"\r\n\r\nThe girl curtsied.\r\n\r\n\"_Mais oui_, Mademoiselle.\"\r\n\r\nShe was leaving the room when Grace called her back.\r\n\r\n\"Take these flowers away, too. Their strong perfume makes me nervous.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Tres bien_, Mademoiselle.\"\r\n\r\nElevating her eyebrows as if to convey that she quite understood the\r\nsituation, the maid took up the floral-basket and disappeared.\r\n\r\nGrace resumed her vigil at the window, watching eagerly every one who\r\ncame in sight along the avenue, wondering if each newcomer was the one\r\nman who was in her thoughts.\r\n\r\nShe was annoyed with herself for having betrayed herself before the\r\nservant. Yet surely they could all see that she detested the Prince, and\r\nthat she was only marrying him for his lofty position. It had been the\r\nambition of her life, her father approved it, her friends envied her,\r\nthe papers were full of the splendors of the wonderful Eurasian palace\r\nof which she would one day be mistress. How could she resist? Yet how\r\nthey must all despise her for selling herself!\r\n\r\nOnce more she took up Armitage's letter and read it through. She\r\nwondered why he was leaving America and what the change for the better\r\nof which he spoke could be. No doubt he had been successful in securing\r\nmore congenial employment. She was sincerely glad to hear it. She would\r\nremember him always.\r\n\r\nShe wondered why life was so contrary, so cruel. The one man she could\r\nhave loved truly, sincerely, was too poor for her to marry, too far\r\nbeneath her in the social scale. Suppose she braved everything for his\r\nsake, what then? It would break her father's heart. All her friends\r\nwould laugh at her. The world would ostracise her. No--it was an\r\nimpossible dream. She owed something to her position. Her own happiness\r\nmust be sacrificed to please others. Angry, defiant yet powerless to\r\nresist the laws of the society she moved in, she rebelled at the\r\ninjustice and cruelty of it.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the bell at the front door rang. She heard voices, followed by\r\nsteps on the stairs. A footman appeared on the library threshold.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Armitage has called to see Miss Harmon.\"\r\n\r\nGrace advanced, nervous.\r\n\r\n\"Ask Mr. Armitage to come up.\"\r\n\r\nThe servant withdrew, and Grace crossed hastily to the mirror to see if\r\neverything about herself was as she wanted him to see it. A moment later\r\nshe heard some one enter the room behind her. It was Armitage. She\r\nturned and greeted him with a smile, extending her hand, which for a\r\nmoment he held firmly in his.\r\n\r\nShe hardly knew him, so altered was he in appearance. He wore a neat\r\nbusiness suit, with derby hat and gloves. His hair trimmed and carefully\r\nbrushed, was more wavy and glossy than usual, and a close shave threw\r\ninto still greater relief the academic outline of his features. The\r\nchange was so remarkable that at first she hardly recognized him. But\r\nwhen she heard the familiar rich tones of his deep, manly voice, no\r\nfurther doubt was possible.\r\n\r\n\"I've come to say good-by,\" he said, with a smile.\r\n\r\n\"What a change!\" she exclaimed, with an effort to appear light-hearted\r\nand at ease.\r\n\r\nHe made no answer for a moment, embarrassed as to what to say. Then he\r\nreplied:\r\n\r\n\"Yes--I do look a little different, don't I? It's wonderful what clothes\r\nwill do. No wonder they are the world's only standard!\"\r\n\r\n\"Come and sit here and tell me about it.\"\r\n\r\nShe led the way to the low recess at the bay-window, and, sinking down\r\non the cushions, she motioned him to take a seat opposite.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me,\" she repeated, \"what good fairy has worked this\r\ntransformation?\"\r\n\r\nHe smiled as he replied:\r\n\r\n\"Things have changed a little for the better.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean that you have found more lucrative and congenial employment?\"\r\n\r\nHe hesitated, not willing to lie to her. Yet, after all, it was the\r\ntruth. His new position was decidedly more lucrative.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he replied, after a pause. \"More lucrative--more congenial.\"\r\n\r\nGrace was puzzled. His answers were vague. He was hiding something from\r\nher. Perhaps he thought her questions impertinent. After all, what right\r\nhad she to question him?\r\n\r\n\"I'm pleased--for your sake,\" she answered, rather haughtily.\r\n\r\nArmitage was quick to notice the difference in her tone, and intuitively\r\nhe divined the reason.\r\n\r\n\"For my sake?\" he echoed. \"Why should you care?\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall always be glad to hear that you are prospering and--happy,\" she\r\nanswered.\r\n\r\nHe looked into her eyes without speaking. There was a melancholy,\r\nwistful expression in his face. He seemed to want to say something and\r\ndid not dare. Embarrassed by the continuity of his fixed gaze, she\r\naverted her head and looked out of the window over into the park, where\r\nthe nurses and children were playing on the green lawns. There was a\r\nsilence that was almost painful. At last he broke it.\r\n\r\n\"You will be happy,\" he said. \"One day you will be a Princess!\"\r\n\r\nGrace sighed. With a forced laugh she said:\r\n\r\n\"Happiness! What is happiness? We are always pursuing it, we think we've\r\nfound it, only to find it empty and unreal, after all.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're happy, aren't you?\" he persisted.\r\n\r\nFor a moment she made no answer. Then she said:\r\n\r\n\"Yes--I suppose I am.\"\r\n\r\n\"When do you expect to get married?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know--nothing is settled--perhaps never----\"\r\n\r\nShe laughed nervously. There was something in the tone of her voice that\r\nsounded like a stifled sob.\r\n\r\nArmitage watched her closely. This was not the way a happy woman acts or\r\ntalks. Could it be that she did not care for the Prince, that she was\r\nforcing herself in this ambitious marriage in spite of her own better,\r\ntruer self? Certainly the man was unworthy of her. The escapades and\r\nscandals in which he had been mixed up were the talk of Europe. She must\r\nbe aware of his real character, or was she completely blinded by the\r\nbrilliancy of his position? His heart throbbed furiously as he thought\r\nthat he had perhaps guessed the truth.\r\n\r\nHe wondered if it would make any difference if he told her everything,\r\nof the miraculous change in his fortune, that he was no longer a\r\npenniless outcast of society, but the bearer of one of the proudest\r\ntitles in England. That's why he hesitated. It might make a difference,\r\nand that he didn't want. If after being told of the change in his\r\nposition she consented to marry him, he would always suspect that it was\r\nfor his title. No, if he was to win her he was determined that she\r\nshould love him for himself. The thought that there was still a\r\npossibility of making her his wife had never presented itself until now.\r\nOn the desert island, remote from the conventions of civilized life,\r\nbound only by nature's laws, he had claimed her as his chattel, his\r\nprimordial right. He was the lord and master whose will she must obey\r\nwithout question. But now, restored to the protection of civilization,\r\nshe was free to exercise her own will, and it had never occurred to him\r\nthat, of all the men who had courted her, she might have chosen him from\r\npreference. Such a possibility was beyond his most fantastic dreams.\r\nYet, after all, why not?\r\n\r\nBreaking the long and awkward silence, he said:\r\n\r\n\"Have you quite recovered from your experience on Hope Island?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--I'm all right now,\" she replied quickly.\r\n\r\n\"You're more comfortable, at any rate,\" he smiled, glancing around at\r\nthe oriental rugs, books and costly _objets d'art_ with which the\r\nluxuriously furnished room was littered. \"I suppose you're glad to be\r\nhome.\"\r\n\r\nShe shook her head, and a wistful smile came into her face as she\r\nanswered:\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes I wish I were back there. Now that I've returned, it's the\r\nsame social treadmill again--the same exhausting round of teas,\r\nreceptions, dinners, and all the rest, hearing women talk nothing but\r\ndress and scandal and bridge until you begin to think there is nothing\r\nelse in the world worth discussing. It's nauseating. When I think of\r\nthose ideal days on the little island--the life of perfect peace under\r\nthe cool trees by the silver sea--doing cheerfully each day's allotted\r\ntask, helping you as best I could--when I think of how happy I was\r\nleading that lonely peaceful existence, I'm almost sorry we were\r\nrescued.\"\r\n\r\nA glad smile broke over his face. His eyes flashed and his mouth\r\ntrembled slightly as he eagerly bent forward.\r\n\r\n\"Really?\" he said. \"You were happier then?\"\r\n\r\nShe flushed and then turned pale. He hardly heard the low answer that\r\ncame from her lips:\r\n\r\n\"I don't know.\"\r\n\r\nHis steady gaze embarrassed her. She was afraid that he might read the\r\nsecret which lay deep in her heart. Rising abruptly from her seat by the\r\nwindow, she crossed the room, stopping near a side table to arrange some\r\nAmerican beauty roses in a vase. Armitage rose and followed her.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me,\" he persisted eagerly. \"Were you happier then than you are\r\nnow?\"\r\n\r\n\"Suppose we change the subject,\" she said hastily, without turning\r\nround. \"Let us talk about you and your plans. So you're going to\r\nEngland?\"\r\n\r\nHe nodded gravely.\r\n\r\n\"I sail on Saturday. I came to say good-by.\"\r\n\r\nGrace nervously plucked one of the roses and crushed its soft, perfumed\r\npetals against her face. Her head still averted, she said: \"But you'll\r\ncome back?\"\r\n\r\n\"No--never,\" he replied firmly.\r\n\r\nShe made no reply, and, as he could not see her face, he did not know\r\nthat tears were in her eyes and that her lips were trembling. She could\r\nnot speak without betraying her feelings. An awkward silence followed.\r\n\r\nArmitage stood watching her. This girl loved him--he was convinced of\r\nthat now. Only her pride was keeping them apart. A struggle for the\r\nmastery was going on within her, between her artificial self and her\r\ntrue self. One word from him and she would know that she had no reason\r\nto be ashamed of the man to whom she had given her love; that, on the\r\ncontrary, she might be proud to be his wife. But that one word he was\r\ndetermined not to speak. He owed that much to his manhood, to his\r\nself-respect. This would be the crucial test. If she loved him, it must\r\nbe for himself alone, not for his title. If he won her, he would proudly\r\ncarry off the prize of two New York seasons--he, penniless, unknown, to\r\nall appearances an ordinary workman!\r\n\r\nHe moved forward so he could see her face.\r\n\r\n\"We've been good friends,\" he went on. \"I can never forget you. You made\r\na new man of me. You came into my life at a time when everything seemed\r\nat an end. Your sweet, gentle influence filled me with renewed hope,\r\nrenewed energy, a determination to begin life anew. Suddenly, I\r\ndiscovered that you were indispensable to my happiness. In my folly I\r\ndreamed that you might become my wife. Perhaps if things had turned out\r\notherwise, if the _Saucy Polly_ had not come---- Well, what's the use of\r\ntalking of that now? I was insane. I lifted my eyes to the stars. I\r\ndeserved to be punished for my temerity.\"\r\n\r\nGrace did not stir. Fascinated, she stood listening to his words. There\r\nwas sadness in his voice, and the music of its rich tones still\r\nexercised on her its old-time magnetism. What potent attraction was\r\nthere about this man that rendered her powerless to resist his pleading?\r\nWas she afraid to confess to herself that she loved him and that she was\r\nready to do anything, break off with the Prince, incur the ridicule of\r\nher friends, offend her father--for his sake?\r\n\r\nArmitage continued:\r\n\r\n\"But that is all over now. We part good friends. You go your way--I will\r\ngo mine. You will find happiness with the Prince----\"\r\n\r\nGrace turned quickly. Her eyes red and flashing, her bosom heaving with\r\npent-up emotion, she cried:\r\n\r\n\"The Prince! The Prince! I detest the Prince! I wouldn't marry him if\r\nthere wasn't another man left in the world.\"\r\n\r\nArmitage drew back, surprised.\r\n\r\n\"Aren't you engaged to him?\" he demanded.\r\n\r\n\"No--no! That is only newspaper talk. He has been annoying me with his\r\nattentions, and of course all my people were flattered. But there's\r\nnothing more serious.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank God!\" he muttered under his breath.\r\n\r\n\"What did you say?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad--for your sake,\" was his evasive answer.\r\n\r\nHe approached closer and held out his hand.\r\n\r\n\"Good-by,\" he said in a low tone.\r\n\r\nAgain she averted her head, and as she did so she stumbled against the\r\ntable. Afraid she was going to fall, he caught her by the hand. Their\r\nhands remained clasped. She made no attempt to withdraw. He grew bolder\r\nand went still nearer. A strange sensation of sudden weakness came over\r\nher. She felt as if her will-power was about to succumb before a\r\nsuperior mental force. She loved this man. He was the first and only man\r\nshe had ever cared for, and she was losing him. Her eyes filled with\r\ntears. What had she done that the happiness which other women know\r\nshould not be granted also to her?\r\n\r\n\"Good-by!\" he said again.\r\n\r\nShe made no answer. Bending forward to catch a glimpse of her face, he\r\nsaw traces of tears.\r\n\r\n\"What?\" he exclaimed. \"You are crying!\"\r\n\r\n\"Am I?\" she said quickly, making a desperate effort to hide her face.\r\n\"How foolish!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why are you crying?\" he demanded.\r\n\r\n\"I'm nervous, I think. I have not yet quite recovered from the wreck.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked at her, trying to read her innermost thoughts. She met his\r\ngaze unflinchingly.\r\n\r\n\"Is that the reason, or is there another?\" Drawing her gently to him, he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"You are unhappy-- I know you are---- You are allowing your pride to\r\nstand in the way of your happiness. I have no right to blame you. You\r\nare free to do as you think is right. Only I am sorry for you--sorrier\r\nfor you than I am for myself. Good-by. May God bless and protect you.\r\nJust one kind word, one smile before I go. We may never see each other\r\nagain.\"\r\n\r\nHis voice trembled and grew husky. Manlike, he was ashamed of showing\r\nemotion; he was anxious to get away before he lost control of himself.\r\nHe left her standing there, took his hat and gloves and went toward the\r\ndoor. She stood motionless watching him going, powerless to utter the\r\nword that would stay him. The color left her face. She grew ashen pale.\r\nHer entire being trembled with suppressed emotion.\r\n\r\nAt the door he turned round for the last time.\r\n\r\n\"Good-by--God bless you!\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Wait--just a moment--just a moment!\" she cried desperately.\r\n\r\nThe spell seemed broken. She made a movement forward, her hand\r\noutstretched. There was a wild look of mute appeal in her eyes.\r\n\r\n\"You are going alone,\" she demanded, her breath coming and going in\r\nquick spasmodic gasps.\r\n\r\n\"Yes--alone.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"NO--YOU'RE NOT! I'M GOING WITH YOU.\"]\r\n\r\n\"No--no--you're not!\" she cried, advancing toward him.\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\" he demanded.\r\n\r\n\"Because I'm going with you!\"\r\n\r\nThe next instant she was in his arms, her face buried in his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Going with me?\" he exclaimed hoarsely. He thought he must be dreaming.\r\nDoes such happiness as this come to a man so suddenly?\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she whispered; \"as your wife--to the end of the world if\r\nnecessary.\"\r\n\r\n\"But have you considered everything--your father--your friends--the\r\nuncertain future?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've weighed everything. I knew that I loved you all along. I struggled\r\nwith my pride, and I've mastered it. My father will forgive me when he\r\nknows that I am happy. As to what society thinks, I don't care.\"\r\n\r\n\"But are you willing to marry a poor man--are you willing to sacrifice\r\nall the luxuries you now enjoy for what may be a precarious existence\r\nwith me?\"\r\n\r\nShe looked up at him, her face radiant.\r\n\r\n\"I'd give up everything for you. Wealth does not bring happiness. I've\r\nfound that out. I did not know what happiness was until I spent those\r\nblissful days with you on Hope Island. I'll welcome poverty if I am to\r\nshare it with you. We can live in a cottage, on nothing a year, and I'll\r\nstill be the happiest woman on earth.\"\r\n\r\nHe clasped her in his strong arms and fiercely kissed her unresisting\r\nlips. Here was a woman that any man might rejoice to call wife, and he\r\nhad won her by love alone.\r\n\r\n\"It isn't as bad as all that, dearest,\" he said, with a smile.\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\" she demanded, puzzled.\r\n\r\n\"There is no immediate danger of your having to live any differently.\"\r\n\r\nGrace opened her eyes in amazement.\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\" she repeated. \"My father may be so incensed that he\r\nwon't give me anything.\"\r\n\r\nArmitage smiled.\r\n\r\n\"We wouldn't take it if he did.

Mr. Hornblow knows his subject\r\n    and has succeeded in welding his own characteristic and\r\n    illuminating expression to the idea of another man in such a manner\r\n    that the novel must take its place beside the play as a welcome\r\n    addition to American art.\"\r\n\r\nWashington POST\r\n\r\n    \"Will become the most talked-of book of the year....
