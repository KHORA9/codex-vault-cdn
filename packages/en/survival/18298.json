We never see the fish here before May,\r\nand then very rarely; a few come in June, July, and August if\r\nthere are high floods in the river, and about the latter end of\r\nSeptember they become tolerably abundant; as the fisheries near\r\nthe mouth of the river have then ceased for the season, and the\r\nSalmon run very freely up the river from that time to the middle\r\nor end of December. They begin to spawn at the latter end of\r\nOctober, but the greater part of those that spawn here do so in\r\nDecember. I believe nearer the source of the river they are\r\nearlier, but many fish are seen on the spawning beds in January;\r\nand I have even seen a pair so late as March; but this last is of\r\nvery rare occurrence.\r\n\r\nSome of the male Kipper (Kelts) come down in December and January,\r\nbut the greater part of the females remain in the river until\r\nApril, and they are occasionally seen herding with shoals of\r\nSmolts in May. In this state they will take a worm very readily,\r\nand are, many of them, caught with the fly in the deeps; but they\r\nare unfit to eat, the flesh being white, loose, and insipid;\r\nalthough they have lost the red dingy appearance which they had\r\nwhen about to spawn, and are almost as bright as the fresh fish,\r\ntheir large heads and lank bodies render it sufficiently easy to\r\ndistinguish them from fish which are only ascending the river,\r\neven if the latter were plentiful at this season; but this is\r\nunfortunately not the case.\r\n\r\nSecondly, we have the Mort. I am not sure whether this fish is\r\nwhat is called the Grilse in Scotland, or whether it is the Sea\r\nTrout of that country; it is a handsome fish, weighing from one\r\nand a half to three pounds. We first see Morts in June; from that\r\ntime to the end of September they are plentiful in favourable\r\nseasons in the Hodder, a tributary stream of the Ribble, although\r\nthey are never very numerous in the Ribble above the mouth of that\r\nstream. It is the opinion of the fishermen here that this is a\r\ndistinct species; my own opinion is, that it is a young Salmon,\r\nand yet, if I were called upon to give reasons for thinking so, I\r\ncould not offer any very conclusive ones: the best I have is, that\r\nthere is no perceptible difference in the fry when going down to\r\nsea. It may be said, How do you know that one of the three or four\r\nvarieties of Smolts which you describe further on, is not the fry\r\nof the Mort? To this objection, if made, I say that these\r\nvarieties exist in the Wharfe, where, owing either to natural or\r\nartificial causes, there is never either a Mort or a Sprod\r\n(Whitling?) seen.\r\n\r\nThirdly, we have the Sprod, which is, I believe, synonymous with\r\nthe Whitling, Whiting, or Birling of Scotland. It is a beautiful\r\nfish of six or eight ounces in weight, and has more the appearance\r\nof the Salmon than the Mort; it seldom ascends the river before\r\nJuly, and, like the Mort, is far more abundant in the Hodder than\r\nin the Ribble; this fish sometimes rises pretty freely at the fly,\r\nand when it does so, makes a very handsome addition to the\r\nangler's basket, but at other times it is difficult to hook,\r\nbecause of its shyness. It disappears in a great measure about\r\nSeptember.\r\n\r\nFourthly, we have the Pink, or Par, which is found of two or three\r\nsizes in the Ribble; the largest are all males, and in October the\r\nmilt in them is large; they are small fishes, ranging in weight\r\nfrom about one to three ounces each, and it is well remarked by\r\nthe author of that delightful book \"Wild Sports of the West,\" they\r\nhave very much the appearance of Hybrids between the Salmon and\r\nthe Trout; they rise very freely at the fly and maggot, from July\r\nto October, and afford good sport to the angler who is satisfied\r\nwith catching small fish. I trust I shall be able in the following\r\npages to give some information respecting this fish which will\r\nassist in dispelling the mystery in which its natural history has\r\nbeen enveloped.\r\n\r\nI will now mention a few of the opinions respecting the various\r\nspecies of the Salmon, and also my own, when they are at variance\r\nwith the generally received ones, and give the facts and\r\nreasonings which have induced me to form those opinions, and I\r\nshall be very glad, if I am in error on any of these points, if\r\nsome one of my readers, better acquainted with the subject than I\r\nam, will take the trouble to set me right. It seems to be the\r\nopinion of many, indeed of most persons, that the Salmon spawns\r\nfrom November to February, that the young fry, or Smolts, go down\r\nto the sea in the April or May following; my own opinion is that\r\nthey stay in the river much longer. The Grilse is by many believed\r\nto be a distinct species, whilst others stoutly maintain that it\r\nis a young Salmon.\r\n\r\nThe testimony of the witnesses from the Severn, the Wye, the Lee,\r\nnear Cork, and the Ness (see the evidence given before the Select\r\nCommittees of the House of Commons in 1824 and 1825), would lead\r\none to suppose that the fish were in best season from November to\r\nMarch, whilst the evidence of the witnesses from other parts of\r\nthe kingdom goes to prove that this is the very worst period for\r\ncatching them.\r\n\r\nOne maintains that each river has its own variety of fish, which\r\ncan be distinguished from the fish of any other river; another\r\ncontends that there is no such difference; a third states that\r\nstake nets are exceedingly injurious to the breed of the fish; and\r\na fourth attests that stake nets only catch the fish when they are\r\nin the best season, that neither Kelt nor fry are taken in them,\r\nand that if they were prohibited it would only be preserving the\r\nfish for the grampuses and seals;--in short, the evidence\r\nregarding both their habits, and the best mode of catching them,\r\nhaving in view the preservation and increase of the breed, is so\r\ncompletely contradictory as to leave a doubt in the mind of every\r\none who reads it, and has no other means of forming an opinion. I\r\nwill endeavour to show in some instances which of the testimonies\r\nis correct, and it will be for my readers to judge how far I\r\nsucceed, and I hope they will be so obliging as to correct any\r\nerror into which I may fall.\r\n\r\nFirst.--It is my opinion that the fry of Salmon are much older\r\nwhen they leave the river than seems to be generally supposed, and\r\nthat the growth of this fish is by no means so rapid as it is\r\nconsidered to be by those who have written upon the subject. For\r\nseveral years previous to 1816 the Salmon were unable to ascend\r\ninto the upper parts of the river Wharfe, being prevented either\r\nby the high weirs in the lower parts, or by some other cause, and\r\nof course there were no Smolts or Par; but in that year either the\r\nincessant rains of that summer or rumours of the formation of an\r\nassociation for the protection of fish, or some other unknown\r\ncause, enabled some Salmon to ascend the river, thirty or forty\r\nmiles, and to spawn there. In the next spring, 1817, there were no\r\nSmolts, but about September they began to rise at the very small\r\nflies which the anglers use in that river--they were then a little\r\nlarger than Minnows. In the spring of 1818 there were blue Smolts,\r\nor what are generally known as Salmon fry, which went down to the\r\nsea in the May of that year; but these were only part of the\r\nbrood, the females only, the males remaining all that summer,\r\nbeing at the period when the females went down very much smaller\r\nthan they, and what was called at the Wharfe Grey Smolt and Pinks,\r\nor Par elsewhere.\r\n\r\nI have shown that there were two migrations from the spawn of\r\n1816; but this was not all--there still remained a few Smolts\r\nthrough the summer of 1819, which by that time were from four to\r\nsix ounces in weight, and which are known by the anglers there as\r\nBrambling Smolts. The blue marks on their sides are very distinct,\r\nand the fish is a perfect Smolt, except that it is considerably\r\nlarger. It is quite different from the Whitling, or Sprod, which\r\nis not known in the Wharfe, at least not in the upper parts of\r\nthat river, whilst the Brambling is never seen in the Ribble. [1]\r\n\r\nThe Brambling is a beautiful fish, and it rises very freely both\r\nat the May fly and the artificial fly through the summer; it is\r\noccasionally caught by anglers with the worm on the Salmon\r\nspawning beds in the autumn, with the milt perfectly developed,\r\nand in a fluid state. Although this fish is not found in the\r\nRibble, so far as my observations and inquiries have gone, I\r\nbelieve that it is found in the Tweed, and perhaps also in other\r\nrivers running into the German Ocean; for a letter addressed to\r\nMr. Kennedy, who was chairman of the select committee appointed to\r\ninvestigate this subject, by a Mr. George Houy, states that the\r\nSmolts are sometimes found there ten inches long, which he\r\nattributes to their not being able to get down at the proper\r\nperiod for want of a flood in the river. But I know that in the\r\nRibble Smolts will go down to the sea without there being a flood\r\nat all, if that does not come within ten days or a fortnight of\r\nthe time at which they usually descend to the sea. I also know\r\nthat Brambling are found in the Wharfe, in years where there has\r\nbeen no deficiency in that respect; yet why they should be common\r\nin that river, when they are never met with in the Ribble, which\r\nhas ten times as many Salmon and Smolts in it, I am unable to\r\ncomprehend.\r\n\r\nIt is my opinion that the ova of the Salmon are not hatched before\r\nMarch or April. Two anglers, who were in April wading in the river\r\nWharfe, came upon a spawning bed, which they had the curiosity to\r\nexamine; they found a number of ova, in which they could see the\r\nyoung fry already alive, and one of them took these eggs home with\r\nhim. By regularly and frequently supplying them with fresh water,\r\nhe succeeded in hatching them, and kept some of the young fishes\r\nalive for some time; but they died in consequence of neglect, and\r\nwere even then very diminutive. The opinion generally received in\r\nScotland seems to be, if I may judge from the evidence given\r\nbefore the House of Commons, that the Smolts go down to the sea in\r\nthe spring after they are spawned, and that they return in the\r\nsummer and autumn of the same year as Grilse. When they return,\r\nand what size they are on their first visit, I have hitherto been\r\nunable to ascertain; but I think I have succeeded in proving that\r\nthey do not go to the sea so soon as is generally believed, nor do\r\nany of the witnesses give their reasons for thinking that they do.\r\nI should very much like to learn what evidence they have to offer\r\nin behalf of this opinion.\r\n\r\nI remember seeing an article in the \"Scotsman,\" perhaps about\r\ntwelve months ago, in which it was stated that Dr. Knox had made\r\nsome important discoveries in the natural history of the Salmon\r\nand Herring, both in their food and propagation, and, if I\r\nrecollect aright, it stated that he had ascertained that the eggs\r\nremained several months in the gravel, and that then, in a few\r\ndays or weeks after, they (_i.e._ the fish hatched from them) were\r\nso much grown as to go down to the sea; but none of the data which\r\nenabled him to arrive at this conclusion were given, and since\r\nthen I have heard nothing about the matter. As it is so long since\r\nI read this article, I may have quoted it incorrectly, but I\r\nbelieve its substance was what I have stated.\r\n\r\nThe only conclusive evidence I can find about the hatching of\r\nSalmon fry is that of Mr. George Hogarth (second Parl. Report, p.\r\n92), and his account agrees with my own: he states that he took\r\nSalmon spawn from the spawning beds, and by keeping it freely\r\nsupplied with fresh water, he succeeded in hatching some of the\r\neggs; he gives drawings of the appearance of the fry in three or\r\nfour different stages, from the egg to the age of eight days (see\r\nAppendix to second Parl. Report), that the young fry, by keeping\r\nthem well supplied with fresh water, were very lively and vigorous\r\nfor three weeks, but that they after this time appeared to grow\r\nlanguid and uneasy, and as they would eat nothing they died when\r\none inch long. Unfortunately he does not state at what time of the\r\nyear they were hatched, but if this were in March or April, which\r\nI see no reason to doubt, it is sufficient to prove that they\r\nwould not reach the size that Smolts are when they leave the river\r\nfor the sea; for supposing them to be hatched the last week in\r\nMarch, and that they lived a month, this would bring us to the\r\ntime when they are about to migrate, at which time they average\r\nmore than six inches long; many of them are eight inches, and at\r\nthis period they are fond of feeding upon worms, flies, maggots,\r\nand caddis worms, as is known to every schoolboy living on the\r\nbanks of a river frequented by Salmon. It is also my opinion that\r\nneither Salmon nor Trout spawn every year, [2] for Salmon ascend\r\nthe river as early as January, in the highest condition, with roe\r\nin them no bigger than mustard seed: these could not have spawned\r\nthat season, as the Kelts, particularly the females, do not return\r\nto the sea until March or April, [3] and at that time they are in\r\nvery bad condition, and do not appear to have a particle of spawn\r\nin them; and in the evidence of Mr. Mackenzie (see Parl. Rep., p.\r\n21), we have an account of a Grilse Kelt which was caught and\r\nmarked in March, 1823, and was again caught as a Salmon on its\r\nreturn to the river in March, 1824. In this case the fish had\r\nevidently required a residence of twelve months in the sea before\r\nit was in a condition to visit the river a second time, and in the\r\nWharfe it is the constant practice of the angler to catch Trout\r\nthrough the winter with very minute roe in them, and in high\r\ncondition with the worm and Salmon roe, and also with night lines.\r\nIn fact, one of the fishermen has frequently remarked to me that\r\nhe occasionally caught dishes of Trout with the fly in January,\r\nand in finer condition, than he has found them in April, which he\r\naccounted for by saying that the spawned fish (Kelts) of that\r\nseason had not begun to rise freely at the fly at the former\r\nperiod, but they had at the latter, so that his pannier contained\r\nas many Kelts as fresh fish. Another reason has just occurred to\r\nme: it is, that in January the spawned fish will still be in the\r\nsmall brooks in which they are so fond of breeding, and of course\r\nthe bulk of the fish remaining in the river at that time would be\r\nfish in good season.\r\n\r\nAs it is some years since I acquired this information, or at least\r\na part of it, I felt afraid of giving it incorrectly; and I\r\ntherefore addressed a letter to a friend living on the banks of\r\nthe Wharfe, requesting him to send me all the information in his\r\npossession on this subject, that derived from his own observations,\r\nas well as that collected from others. He has since the above was\r\nwritten sent me the following reply:--\"I have seen Robinson (one\r\nof the best anglers and fly makers between Cornwall and Caithness),\r\nand have had some conversation with him on the subject of Salmon,\r\n&c. He is of opinion that the spawn of the Salmon remains five\r\nmonths in the gravel before hatching; he examined the spawn in\r\nApril, and found the young fry alive in the eggs, and Ingham,\r\nanother angler, took some home and kept one of the Smolts two or\r\nthree months. I have subsequently seen Ingham, and he has given me\r\nthe same account. All the fishermen here are of opinion that the\r\nfemale Smolts remain one year, and the males two years, before they\r\ngo down to the sea. The Bramblings are supposed to be Smolts which\r\nremain a year longer than the usual time; they are few in number,\r\nand are generally taken with the May fly. I have no doubt that the\r\nabove opinions are correct, for we have now three distinct sizes of\r\nSmolts in the river exclusive of Bramblings, the largest of which\r\nare nearly four ounces in weight, and are all males, as they\r\ncontain milt in October and November. The next are the females of\r\nthe present year: I have had one since the receipt of your letter,\r\nwhich weighed half an ounce and measured five inches in length;\r\nthis was a real blue Smolt; the third are the males of the same\r\nage, and are much smaller; these are occasionally taken with the\r\nworm, and will rise at the fly all the next summer.\"\r\n\r\n\"We were for several years, but I do not know the dates, entirely\r\nwithout Salmon, and of course without Smolts; and we invariably\r\nfound that the Smolts made their appearance the year after the\r\nSalmon, but were very small till the second year, when we had what\r\nwe call blue Smolts, which disappeared in May or June; and what\r\nyou called Pinks, which remained till the following year; and\r\nBrambling Smolts, which remained another year. The fishermen here\r\nare also of opinion that neither Salmon nor Trout spawn every\r\nyear. Robinson says that one day lately (the letter is dated\r\nDecember 13th) he caught seven Trouts, six of which were in good\r\nseason; and he brought me two the other day, one of which\r\ncontained roe, and the other was in excellent condition.\" My\r\nfriend states, in a subsequent communication, that one of the\r\nfishermen had told him that he had caught the male Smolt (Par)\r\nmore abundantly on the Salmon spawning beds than elsewhere, and my\r\nfriend adds that the opinion there is, that if a female Salmon\r\ngets up to the spawning beds, and if no male accompanies her, yet\r\nher eggs are fecundated by the male Smolts; and they allege, in\r\nsupport of this opinion, that a female got up one season and\r\nspawned, and though no male was seen near her her eggs were\r\nprolific. I mention this, although I apprehend it is evidence\r\nwhich the unbeliever will consider inadmissible, for though no\r\nmale was seen, still there may have been one, or admitting that\r\none did spawn, without being accompanied by a male, yet another,\r\nwhich contrived to bring her mate along with her, may have spawned\r\nin the same place the same season; yet, notwithstanding its\r\nliability to these objections, I have no doubt myself that if a\r\nfemale were to come alone her eggs would be impregnated by the\r\nPar. It is an excellent maxim, that Nature makes no useless\r\nprovisions; yet, if we admit that Par are young Salmon, for what\r\npurpose is the milt if not to impregnate Salmon roe? and if we\r\ndeny this to be the fact, we must endeavour to show that there are\r\nfemale Par, but in all my examinations, I have never been able to\r\nmeet with one that contained roe. That the Grilse are Salmon is\r\nproved I think sufficiently by the evidence given before the House\r\nof Commons. Mr. Wm. Stephens states (see Rep., p. 52) that he has\r\nknown Grilse kept in a salt-water pond until they became Salmon,\r\nand that fry that had been marked came back that year as Grilse,\r\nand the year after as Salmon; and Mr. George Hogarth states that\r\nhe has often seen a Salmon and a Grilse working together on the\r\nspawning beds, as two Salmon, or two Grilse; and Mr. Mackenzie\r\nstates (page 21) that he, in March, 1823, marked a Grilse Kelt\r\nwith brass wire, and caught it again in March, 1824, a Salmon of\r\nseven pounds weight. The testimony of the witnesses from the Ness,\r\nthe Severn, the Lee, and some other rivers, is too positive and\r\ntoo well supported to admit of any doubt as to the excellent\r\ncondition of many of the fish ascending those rivers in November,\r\nDecember, and January--a period when they are out of season, and\r\nfull of spawn generally, and even when many fish are caught in\r\nthose rivers in the same unseasonable condition. The fact that\r\nthere are many fish in fine season in those months may be, I\r\nthink, accounted for, if we admit that Salmon spawn every other\r\nyear, which I have I think shown to be very probable; but what it\r\nis that induces those fish to ascend rivers so many months before\r\nthe spawning season, I cannot explain. Probably there may be some\r\nquality in the waters of these rivers, all the year, which is\r\ncongenial to the habits of the fish, while the same quality may\r\nonly be found during part of the year in others; it is certain\r\nthat the quality of the waters in rivers generally varies very\r\nmuch with the season: thus the water of the Ribble, after a flood\r\nin summer, is always of a dark brown colour, being so coloured by\r\nthe peat moss over which it passes, while in winter no such tinge\r\ncan be observed; and there may be other differences with which we\r\nare unacquainted; however, whether this is the true reason or not,\r\nit certainly cannot be that the fish which spawn in October are\r\nimpelled by their desire to propagate their species to ascend the\r\nriver the January before; and if this long residence in fresh\r\nwater were necessary for the proper development of the ova in one\r\nriver, we might suppose it would be necessary in all; yet this is\r\nnot the case, as the red fish which ascend the river in November\r\nand December have at that time the spawn in them nearly ready for\r\nexclusion.\r\n\r\nOn one point, about which there is great difference of opinion,\r\nviz. whether the fish which are bred in the river generally resort\r\nto it again, and whether each river has its own variety of fish, I\r\nam not a competent judge, as I am acquainted with too few rivers\r\nto pretend to decide. I may, however, just remark that the Hodder,\r\nthough it is a much smaller river than the Ribble, is always much\r\nbetter stocked with Salmon, Morts, Sprods, Smolts, and Par than is\r\nthe latter river, which I attribute to the fact that more fish\r\nspawn in the river Hodder, which runs for many miles through the\r\nForest of Bowland (the property of the Duke of Buccleuch) and\r\nother large estates, and the fish are much better protected there\r\nthan in the Ribble, where, with one or two exceptions, the\r\nproperties are very much divided, and few people think it worth\r\ntheir while to trouble themselves on the subject. Dr. Fleming, in\r\nhis letter to Mr. Kennedy (Appendix to the first Rep., 1825),\r\nseems to doubt that Salmon enter rivers for any other purpose than\r\nof propagation, but lest I should misrepresent his opinions, I\r\nwill quote what he has said on the subject:--\"In the evidence\r\ntaken before the Select Committee during the last season of\r\nParliament, and appearing in the report, there are several\r\nstatements of a somewhat imposing kind, which, as they appear to\r\nme to be erroneous and apt to mislead, I shall here take the\r\nliberty of opposing.\" He then enumerates several opinions\r\nexpressed before the Select Committee, one of which is, that\r\nSalmon enter and leave rivers for other purposes than those\r\nconnected with spawning (see the evidence of Messrs. Little,\r\nHalliday, and Johnstone).\r\n\r\nFirst, \"That they enter rivers to rid themselves of sea lice\r\n(_Monoculus piscinus_);\" secondly, \"That they forsake rivers to\r\nsave themselves from being exhausted by residence in fresh water,\r\nand from having their gills devoured by a maggot (_Lernaea\r\nsalmonea_).\" The whole history of the Salmon contradicts this\r\nhypothesis. Another of these errors is, that it is asserted (Rep.,\r\n1824, p. 145), \"That Salmon always return to the same river;\" this\r\nis not probable, when we consider the circumstances in which they\r\nare placed during their residence in the sea. On the first of\r\nthese opinions, I am not a competent judge; but I think that the\r\nfact that Salmon enter rivers nine or ten months before they are\r\nready to spawn, is of itself sufficient to show that there are\r\nother reasons for their entering rivers than those connected with\r\npropagation. With respect to the second, I believe that after\r\nSalmon have once entered rivers, at least when they have ascended\r\ninto the upper parts of them, they never offer to descend again\r\nuntil they have spawned. On the third opinion I would remark, that\r\nalthough I do not think that Salmon always come to the same river\r\nin which they were bred, yet I think they will do so if they can;\r\nand I think that the fact which I have mentioned of the Hodder, a\r\nsmaller and a tributary stream to the Ribble, containing many more\r\nSalmon, as well as more Morts and Sprods, countenances this\r\nsupposition, for why should the larger number of fish ascend the\r\nsmaller river except for such a reason?\r\n\r\nI am of opinion that Salmon do not grow so fast in the sea as is\r\ngenerally supposed. It is here generally believed that the Smolts,\r\nwhich go down in the spring, come up again in the August or\r\nSeptember following, five or six pounds in weight; and George\r\nLittle, Esq., in his evidence states that as his opinion, but he\r\ndoes not give any other reason for it than this: \"That the Grilse\r\nthat ascend the river in June weigh one and a half or two pounds,\r\nand that those which come in September weigh five or six pounds,\"\r\n--but opposed to this supposition is the evidence of Mr. Mackenzie,\r\nbefore referred to (second Parl. Report, p. 21), who states that\r\nhe caught in March a Grilse Kelt which weighed three and a half\r\npounds, that he marked it with a brass wire, and let it go, and\r\nthat in the March following he caught it again a Salmon of seven\r\npounds weight. Now a fish which weighed three and a half pounds as\r\na Kelt, would weigh five pounds or six pounds when in high\r\ncondition the summer before, and if this were so, which I believe\r\nall persons who are acquainted with Salmon will admit, the fish\r\nwould have gained only one pound or two pounds in fifteen or\r\neighteen months. Besides, if Salmon grew as fast as is stated and\r\nbelieved by many persons, the breeds of different years would vary\r\nvery much in weight, whereas it is known to everybody that we have\r\nthem of all sizes, from five pounds to forty pounds; and it is\r\ncontrary to analogy to suppose that a fish which is two or three\r\nyears in arriving at the weight of as many ounces, should in two\r\nor three months acquire as many pounds. There are, however, two or\r\nthree things about which all persons agree in opinion--one of\r\nthese is: that the breed of Salmon is decreasing every year, and\r\nthat the great cause of this decrease is the want of protection,\r\nand a consequent destruction in the spawning season. The complaint\r\non this head is universal from north to south; from the Shannon to\r\nthe Tweed, the cry is--\"Protect the breeding fish, or we shall\r\nvery soon have none to protect.\" And yet, although the destruction\r\nof the spawning fish, and the destruction of the fry in the\r\nSpring, are the chief reasons for this alarming falling off, no\r\none seems able to devise a remedy; no one seems inclined to make\r\nthe necessary sacrifices for so desirable an object, and without\r\nthese sacrifices it would be absurd to expect the fish to become\r\nplentiful; and instead of furnishing an abundant supply of cheap\r\nand wholesome food to all classes, which they certainly would do\r\nif the fisheries were properly regulated, they will either become\r\nwholly extinct, or so rare as to be found only at the tables of\r\nthe wealthy. James Gillies, in his evidence, states that his\r\nbrother had in one night killed in the Tweed four hundred Salmon\r\nat one landing-place in close time; and all the reports are full\r\nof statements showing how unceasing and universal is the\r\npersecution the Salmon undergo, not only when in season, but at\r\nall times, and most of all when every one should do his utmost to\r\npreserve them--I mean when they are spawning. In this neighbourhood\r\nthe properties generally are so much divided, and so few good fish\r\nare allowed to ascend the river, that no one has any interest in\r\nprotecting them in close time, and the consequence is, as might be\r\nexpected, that all sorts of contrivances for taking them are\r\nresorted to: they are speared and netted in the streams by day and\r\nnight; they are caught with the fly, they are taken with switch\r\nhooks (large hooks fixed to the ends of staves), or with a triple\r\nhook fixed to the end of a running line and a salmon rod; if the\r\nriver becomes low, parties of idle fellows go up each side of it\r\nin search of them, and by stoning the deeps, or dragging a horse's\r\nskull, or large bone of any kind through them, they compel the\r\nfish to _side_, and there they fall an easy prey, in most cases\r\nwhere the pool is of small extent. In a river so small as the\r\nRibble, it will be readily believed that not many fish can deposit\r\ntheir spawn in safety, when practices of this kind are followed\r\nalmost openly, and when no one feels a sufficient interest in the\r\nmatter to put a stop to them. A single party of poachers killed\r\nfour hundred Salmon in one spawning season near the source of the\r\nriver; the roe of which, when potted, they sold for L20. Need we\r\nbe surprised, then, if the breed decreases? The only wonder is that\r\nthey have not been exterminated long ago.\r\n\r\nI may perhaps be allowed to say what, in my opinion, would remedy\r\nthis alarming destruction, particularly as no one hitherto seems\r\nto have devised an efficient preventive. I believe that in 1826\r\nthere was an Act of Parliament passed which either repealed or\r\nmodified some of the old laws on the subject, and I have also\r\nunderstood that the good effects of this new law are already\r\nperceptible in Scotland, to which it is exclusively applied. There\r\nwas a bill introduced into Parliament in 1825 which was intended\r\nto apply to the whole kingdom; but some of the clauses were so\r\nvery objectionable, that if they had been carried they could not\r\npossibly have been enforced without stopping and ruining the\r\nmanufactories which were carried on by water-power, and the bill\r\nwas consequently abandoned. The first thing to be done is to give\r\nthe proprietors on the upper part of the river such an interest in\r\nthe fisheries as will make them anxious about the preservation of\r\nthe fish in the spawning season; and to accomplish so desirable an\r\nobject no one ought to fish or keep a net stretched across a river\r\nfor more than twelve hours each day, or from sunrise to sunset;\r\nand every mill-owner ought to be compelled to facilitate the\r\npassage of the fish over his weir by every means consistent with\r\nthe proper supply of water to his wheels. At present the fisheries\r\nat the mouths and lower parts of rivers so completely prevent the\r\naccess of the fish to the upper parts, that unless there happen to\r\nbe high floods, which prevent the fishermen below from keeping\r\ntheir nets in, the upper proprietors comparatively seldom see any\r\nuntil the season is at an end. The evidence before the House of\r\nCommons on this point is exceedingly amusing. One person thinks\r\nthe upper proprietors have no right to expect any fish, as they\r\nhave never paid any consideration for them when they bought their\r\nestates; another states that he pays L7,000 a year to the Duke of\r\nGordon, and that if he is compelled to observe a weekly (not a\r\ndaily) close time, he will lose that proportion of his rent;\r\nanother observes the weekly close time, and opens a passage for\r\nthe fish, but places a crocodile, painted in very glaring colours,\r\nin the gap to frighten them back again; another says he observes\r\nthe weekly close time in his cruive fishing, but no one is allowed\r\nto inspect the cruives; another sends men to break down the stake\r\nnets in the estuary, which reach from high to low water-mark, and\r\nat the same time stretches a net completely across the river from\r\nMarch to August, so that a fish cannot pass without his\r\npermission. No wonder that fish are scarce in the upper parts of\r\nthe river, when such samples of _disinterestedness_ are manifested\r\nby the proprietors of the fisheries below. No wonder that the\r\nupper proprietors should be careless about the protection of fish\r\nfrom which they are not allowed to derive any benefit. No wonder\r\nthat they should connive at, and even encourage, the shameful\r\ndestruction of fish in close time, since that is the only time\r\nthey are allowed to have any. Let the fishermen below make it\r\nworth the while of the upper proprietors to protect the fish, and\r\nthey will receive that protection; but it is too much to expect\r\nfrom human nature that these proprietors will take all the odium\r\nand trouble of preserving them when others reap all the benefit.\r\nThere ought to be conservators employed, to see that the fisheries\r\nare properly regulated, and these should be paid by an assessment\r\non all the proprietors in proportion to the value of their\r\nfisheries.\r\n\r\nI should also recommend an extension and uniformity of close time\r\nin all the rivers in the kingdom, for although it is an undoubted\r\nfact that some clean fish are caught in the river early in the\r\nseason, yet they are comparatively few in number, and their\r\ncapture involves that of a far greater number of spawning and Kelt\r\nfish, which are not only of no value for the table, but the\r\ndestruction of which is in effect the destruction of millions of\r\nfish which would proceed from them. In the first Parl. Rep., p.\r\n11, Mr. Walter Jamieson says, that in the river Tweed, from\r\nJanuary 10th to February 1st, he caught one hundred and twenty-one\r\nfish, only one of which had spawned; from February 1st to March\r\n1st he took forty-four fish, twenty-five of which had not spawned\r\n--fifteen were Kelts and four were clean fish; from March 1st to\r\nMarch 10th he took seventeen fish, seven of which had not spawned\r\n(four of them on the 10th)--six were Kelts and one clean fish. Now\r\nthe close time varies in almost every river, and some have no\r\nclose time at all; thus in the Ribble the close time begins on\r\nSeptember 15th and ends on December 31st, and in the Hodder there\r\nis no legal close time; but there is no practical difference\r\nbetween them in this respect, every one thinking himself entitled\r\nto kill all the fish he can, at all times of the year, in both of\r\nthem. The observance of the weekly close time, that is, opening a\r\npassage for the fish from sunset on Saturday night to sunrise on\r\nMonday morning, is a mere farce, even if it could not be evaded,\r\nas it almost invariably is, for it is well known to every one\r\nconversant with the habits of Salmon, that they only ascend the\r\nrivers when there are freshes (floods) in them, and in summer the\r\nground is generally so dry, and vegetation absorbs so much\r\nmoisture, and the evaporation is so great, that it not only\r\nrequires twice as much rain to produce a flood in the river then\r\nas it does in winter, but when the rain does come its effects are\r\nonly visible in the river for a short time. I have known a strong\r\nfresh in the Ribble in the morning, and the river low again in the\r\nafternoon of the same day. A fresh coming at the beginning of a\r\nweek, would disappear long before the close of it, unless the\r\nrainy weather continued; and thus the strict observance of the\r\nweekly close time would be of little service to the upper\r\nproprietors unless the fresh came at the right end of the week.\r\n\r\nThe Smolts and the Par ought to be protected as strictly as the\r\nSalmon; and there ought to be a penalty attached to the killing of\r\nthem, or having them in possession, and conservators of rivers\r\nought to have the power of inspecting all mills and manufactories\r\ndriven by those rivers, to ascertain that they have no contrivances\r\nfor taking the fry on their way to the sea, as it appears that in\r\nsome rivers they are taken in large quantities. There ought also to\r\nbe a penalty attached to the killing of Kelt fish, which in that\r\nstate are not only tasteless and insipid, but actually unwholesome;\r\nyet they are pursued and destroyed with as much avidity as the fresh\r\nfish, and a very small number of the few that spawn in safety ever\r\nreturn to the sea. A penalty ought also to be inflicted for selling,\r\nbuying, using, or having in possession Salmon roe, either in a fresh\r\nor salted state, as its excellence as a bait for Trout and Eels, and\r\nthe consequent high price at which it sells, are sufficient\r\ntemptations to poachers to kill the Salmon in the spawning season\r\neven if they could not sell or use any other part. Yet destructive\r\nas this practice is, there is an extensive trade in this article--\r\na fishing-tackle maker in Liverpool having told a friend of mine\r\nthat he sold 300 lbs. in a season, which, supposing every egg to\r\nhatch, would produce perhaps five times as many Salmon as are caught\r\nin one year throughout the whole kingdom. [4]\r\n\r\nIn concluding this imperfect sketch, I may remark that I have\r\nomitted many things concerning the natural history and habits of\r\nthe Salmon, fearing to trespass too much on the patience of my\r\nreaders; but I have wished, in addition to communicating some\r\nfacts in the natural history of this fish, which I believe are not\r\ngenerally known, to call the attention of the public to the\r\npresent state of the Salmon fisheries in England. Many of the\r\npreceding observations are founded on the evidence of persons\r\nconnected with the fisheries in Scotland, and are perhaps no\r\nlonger applicable to that part of the kingdom, since there has\r\nbeen an alteration in the laws; whether this is the case or not, I\r\nhave no present means of ascertaining. I shall be glad if any one\r\nhaving a knowledge of the subject will say what benefit, if any,\r\nhas been derived from the alteration; however, it is sufficient\r\nfor my present purpose to show what is the state of things when\r\nthere are no laws on the subject, or, which is the same thing,\r\nwhen there is no attention paid to them; a state of things which,\r\ninstead of promoting an abundant supply of these excellent fish,\r\nand rendering the Salmon fisheries nationally important, tends by\r\nthe habitual disregard of the laws by one party, the selfishness\r\nof another, and the neglect of a third, to render these fisheries\r\nof little and decreasing value; whereas if the lower proprietors\r\nwould allow a tolerable supply of Salmon to come up the river when\r\nthey were worth taking, and the upper ones would preserve them\r\nduring close time, there would be plenty for each and for all.\r\n\r\nI am aware it will be difficult to legislate upon this subject\r\nwithout injury to what is of infinitely greater importance--I mean\r\nthe manufactories of the country. The absurd and impracticable\r\nclauses which were contained in the bill for the protection of the\r\nfisheries, which was introduced into Parliament in 1825, show\r\nthis; yet notwithstanding this difficulty, I think it is possible\r\nto protect the fish without interfering with the interest of the\r\nmill-owners, and to make such laws on the subject as will be\r\neffectual, without calling forth a single objection from any\r\nunprejudiced person. I shall be glad if what I have said on this\r\nsubject should induce any gentleman to turn his attention to it.\r\nThere must be many whose opportunities of observation will enable\r\nthem to determine whatever is doubtful in the natural history of\r\nthe Salmon tribe; whose experience will teach them the defects and\r\nabsurdities of the present laws on the fisheries; and whose\r\ninfluence will, if they can be induced to exert it, materially\r\ncontribute to their amendment.\r\n\r\nCLITHEROE, _January_, 1834.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nTHE SALMON ENTERS AND ASCENDS RIVERS FOR OTHER PURPOSES BESIDES\r\nPROPAGATION. [5]\r\n\r\nIn addition to the objections which I have offered to the seeming\r\ndoubt of Dr. Fleming, whether Salmon enter rivers for any other\r\npurpose besides propagation, the following have come to mind; and\r\nthough they do not apply to the Salmon, they confirm me in the\r\nopinion that there are reasons, of which we know nothing, for fish\r\nascending rivers, which are not at all connected with propagation.\r\nOne is the habit of what is here called streaming. In the winter\r\nthe fish not engaged in spawning (I speak of Trout, Grayling,\r\nChub, Dace, &c.) leave the streams and go into deep water; either\r\nbecause the water is warmer there, or because they there find more\r\nfood; and it is well known to fly-fishers that they do not catch\r\nmany fish in the streams if they begin early, say in February. It\r\nis proverbial here that fish begin to stream when the great grey,\r\nor what is called in other districts the devil or dule crook, and\r\nin March brown or brown drake, comes upon the water; and I have\r\nseen Trout by scores leaping at a weir in the beginning of May,\r\nwhether in search of food or an instinct implanted in them to keep\r\nall parts equally stocked with them, I do not know; but it has\r\ncertainly nothing to do with their spawning. Is it presumptuous to\r\nsuppose that God in His providence has implanted this instinct in\r\nSalmon for our good, that we might have a supply of excellent\r\nfood, which without this would be in a great measure unattainable?\r\nWhether this is the true cause, and the only one, I am unable to\r\ndetermine; but this is the effect produced, and in the absence of\r\nother reasons it is, in my opinion, one that ought to be admitted.\r\nAnother reason why fish ascend rivers is their impatience of heat.\r\nI speak now more particularly of Grayling; if the weather is very\r\nhot at the end of May or the beginning of June, the Grayling in\r\nthe Wharfe (they are almost unknown in this part of the Ribble)\r\nascend the mill streams by hundreds, and go up the wheel races as\r\nfar as they can get, and stay there until the stoppage of the\r\nwheels (many a ducking have I had in pursuit of them), when they\r\nare obliged to beat a retreat, and this often proves a disastrous\r\none to many of them. The ascent of young Eels by millions, and the\r\nascent of the Flounder, are neither of them connected with the\r\npropagation of their kind, and though I cannot say for what\r\npurposes they do ascend, I am, I think, justified in doubting\r\nassertions which seem to have nothing to support them but the\r\npositive manner in which they are made.\r\n\r\nThe Salmon Par is neither a Hybrid nor a distinct species of the\r\n_genus Salmo_, but a state of the common Salmon. The author of\r\n\"Wild Sports of the West\" says of the Par, as I have noted\r\npreviously, \"That it has very much the appearance of a Hybrid\r\nbetween the Salmon and the Trout, and (in a note) that the natural\r\nhistory of this fish is doubtful. Some conjecture that it is a\r\nHybrid between the Salmon and Trout, because it is only found in\r\nrivers which are frequented by Salmon. Others think it a cross\r\nbreed between the sea Trout and river Trout,\" and then he speaks\r\nof this \"hybridous diminutive,\" as if he thought one of these\r\nopinions was correct. That the Par is not the result of a cross\r\nbetween a sea Trout and a river Trout, is proved by the fact that\r\nthere are no sea Trouts in the Wharfe, the Par (admitting it to be\r\na distinct species, which I do not), the Salmon, and common Trout\r\nbeing the only kinds of Salmonidae which are found in that river,\r\nat least where I am acquainted with it. If the Par be the result\r\nof a cross between the Salmon and the Trout, what becomes of it in\r\nthe spring, and where are all the Par, which were so abundant in\r\nOctober, gone to in April? Did they migrate to the sea, the shoals\r\nwould be met with by somebody; and did they stay in the river they\r\nwould be caught at one time or other. However, as it is well known\r\nthat neither of these cases is ever realized, we must suppose\r\nanother, which I have already done in my former communication. In\r\nfact, in angling in the beginning of March, fish are often caught\r\nwhich would puzzle the most experienced fisherman to determine\r\nwhether they are Par or Smolts, especially after they have been\r\ncaught some time; and in a large number caught at that time there\r\nare all the intermediate shades of appearance between the perfect\r\nPar and the real blue Smolt.\r\n\r\nCLITHEROE, _May 29th_, 1834.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nCLITHEROE, _March 18th_, 1846.\r\n\r\nTO MR. PAKINGTON (LORD HAMPTON).\r\n\r\nSIR,--Through the polite attention of Mr. Cardwell I have been\r\nfavoured with a copy of your bill--\"For the better preservation of\r\nSalmon.\" As this is a subject to which I have paid some attention,\r\nI trust it will not be deemed impertinent if I offer some\r\nsuggestions for your consideration with regard to the free gap. It\r\nappears to me that it will be desirable to specify the width and\r\ndepth of this free gap, or it may on the one hand degenerate into\r\na mouse-hole, or on the other hand the surveyor, by the provisions\r\nof the 13th section of the Act, may insist on such a gap being\r\nmade that the whole of the water may be diverted through it, which\r\nin small rivers, where there are ancient and legal hecks or\r\ncruives for the purpose of taking Salmon, will destroy the value\r\nof the fishery. Then, with regard to fence time:--In the 6th\r\nsection of the Act, I presume you do not intend that night fishing\r\nshall be allowed at any season of the year; but it appears to me\r\nthat the expressions in the 6th section would scarcely prevent the\r\nowners of cruives from keeping them open, as they need not go near\r\nthem between sunset and sunrise, and then they will neither lay,\r\ndraw, nor fish with any net, device, or engine. Would it not be\r\nbetter to expressly insist upon all cruive fisheries being\r\npositively closed from sunset to sunrise? or, what would be still\r\nbetter, that the cruive or heck should have a free gap in it, of a\r\nspecified size, which should be kept constantly open between\r\nsunset and sunrise. As this is one of the most important sections\r\nof the Act, I may be pardoned for calling your particular\r\nattention to it; for unless this section be vigorously enforced,\r\nit will be in vain to legislate on the subject;--for the\r\nproprietors near the sources of rivers (where most of the fish\r\nspawn) will never interest themselves about the preservation of\r\nfish which they are not allowed to see when in season, and which\r\nhas hitherto been the case in this neighbourhood at all events;\r\nbut if the fish are allowed a free passage everywhere, and at all\r\ntimes, between sunset and sunrise, the upper proprietors will then\r\nhave some inducement to take care of the fish in the spawning\r\nseason. Until now, all the good fish have been taken in the\r\nfisheries near the mouth of the river.\r\n\r\nThere is at present a great trade carried on in this neighbourhood\r\nin Salmon roe, as a bait for Trout and Eels, and scores of\r\nspawning Salmon are now destroyed for little else than the spawn\r\nthey contain. Cannot this be prevented?\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n_May 5th_, 1846.\r\n\r\nH. GEORGE, ESQ.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I enclose a letter I had addressed to Mr. Pakington on the\r\nsubject of the preservation of the breed of Salmon. I had written\r\nto him because I perceived that he had introduced the bill into\r\nthe House of Commons, but since that letter was written I have\r\nbeen favoured with your address through the politeness of Sir\r\nThomas Winnington, to a friend of mine, and as he requests that\r\nany suggestion about weirs may be addressed to you, I make no\r\napology for enclosing the letter I had addressed to Mr. Pakington\r\nwith some further suggestions, which on looking over my letter I\r\nfind I have omitted to notice.\r\n\r\nIn one of the clauses of the bill (I do not remember which, and I\r\nhave not the bill at hand to refer to) you require that a grating,\r\nthe bars of which shall not be more than three inches distant from\r\neach other, and which shall be placed at the junction of the tail-\r\ngoit with the river, as well as in front of the wheel. This I\r\npresume is to prevent any fish being injured by the wheels, but I\r\nassure you that during the twenty-two years in which I have had\r\nthe management of the works here, I never knew an instance of a\r\nSalmon being either killed or hurt by the wheels. Indeed, I do not\r\nknow half-a-dozen instances of Salmon ever ascending the tail-goit\r\nto the wheel, and I must have seen many instances if this was a\r\ncommon occurrence. This may, however, happen, and the fish may be\r\noccasionally injured where there is much fall lost, and a strong\r\nstream running from a wheel constituted in the old way with open\r\nfloat boards. But the objections to such a plan on the part of the\r\nmanufacturers will be insuperable, in fact, the accumulation of\r\nsticks and leaves in the autumn, and ice in the winter, will be so\r\ngreat at the grating in the tail-goit, that the wheels will be\r\nthrown into back water and the works stopped, and all this loss\r\nand inconvenience will be incurred because of the possibility of a\r\nSalmon being killed or hurt by the wheel. There is not much\r\nprobability of this frequently happening, because, as I said in my\r\nother letter, Salmon seldom migrate except where there are freshes\r\nin the rivers, and then there is so much water flowing down the\r\nusual course of the stream, that the fish have no inducement to\r\nleave it to seek for a passage elsewhere. I would, however,\r\nsuggest that power be given to conservators to go at all times up\r\nthe tail-goits and into the wheelhouses, to see that there are no\r\nillegal contrivances in them for catching the Salmon and Smolts in\r\ntheir migration, as I have certainly heard of such things\r\noccurring.\r\n\r\nIn Sir Thomas Winnington's note to my friend, he says we have\r\ndifficulty enough in endeavouring to obtain support for one day's\r\nclear course; two we could not carry, however desirable. Allow me\r\nto suggest, that in endeavouring to carry so little you rouse up\r\nyour opponents, while there is not enough to stimulate the zeal of\r\nyour friends, for it will be in vain to look for the zealous co-\r\noperation of the proprietors on the upper part of rivers unless\r\nyou give them some inducement. This one day in the week will not\r\neffect, and besides this, you make it illegal to catch Smolts,\r\neven with the rod, which is destroying one of the greatest\r\namusements of the anglers, and depriving them of the most delicate\r\nof fish, and for no object: because, if the provisions of your\r\nbill are carried (without this clause), there will be an abundant\r\nsupply of fish for all purposes, even after the anglers have\r\nenjoyed their sport. I do not see the propriety and utility of\r\nprohibiting the killing of Smolts, because if they lived they\r\nwould become Salmon, any more than I see the propriety of\r\nprohibiting the eating of eggs, because if they were hatched and\r\nlived long enough they would become barn-door fowls.\r\n\r\nLet the legislature and the estuary fisheries give the upper\r\nproprietors a fair share of Salmon when in season, and they will\r\nbe glad to see the angling for Smolts abolished; but it is rather\r\ntoo bad for the estuary fisheries to catch all the good Salmon,\r\nand then grudge to the upper proprietors the angling for Smolts.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, allow me to urge on you the propriety of\r\nendeavouring to obtain such a bill as will give the proprietors of\r\nland on the upper parts of rivers a strong inducement to support\r\nyou, and at the same time that it does this will not injure the\r\nmill-owners; and, with the modifications I have pointed out, I\r\nthink this may be accomplished. I speak on this subject as a\r\npractical man, having some knowledge of the habits of Salmon, and\r\nsuperintending a mill driven by water-power which employs nearly a\r\nthousand people; so that if a bill like yours could be worked in a\r\nsatisfactory manner here, on so small a stream as the Ribble, it\r\nmay anywhere in the kingdom. But if you make a tinkering job of\r\nit, and ask for too little, you will rouse your opponents and\r\ndiscourage your friends. By all means go for a free passage for\r\nthe fish every night from sunset to sunrise in all cases where\r\nthis does not interfere with manufactories, and then there will be\r\nsome inducement to support you.\r\n\r\nI refer you to some papers which I wrote on this subject in the\r\nMagazine of Natural History, in the year 1834, and if you think it\r\nworth while to ask for further information on the subject, I shall\r\nbe happy to give you any I may possess.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nLOW MOOR, _July 1st_, 1846.\r\n\r\nTo the Editor of \"The Times.\"\r\n\r\nThe attempt which is now making to amend the laws relating to the\r\nSalmon fisheries, appears to run such a great risk of failure,\r\nfrom the opposition of interested persons, that I think a short\r\nsketch of the defects of the present laws and their effects on the\r\nbreed of fish, and a comparison of them with the proposed\r\namendment, may be interesting to some of your readers, and may,\r\nperhaps, induce some influential gentlemen to throw their\r\ninfluence into the right scale, in the approaching discussion on\r\nthis subject.\r\n\r\nThe Salmon fisheries in former times appear to have supplied food\r\nfor a large portion of the people, as there are still traditions\r\ncurrent on the banks of various rivers in the north, that the\r\nindentures of apprenticeship always stipulated that the apprentice\r\nshould not be compelled to eat Salmon more frequently than three\r\ndays a week, and however exaggerated this story may appear at the\r\npresent day, I hope to succeed in showing that it is neither\r\nimprobable that it has been so, nor impossible that it may be so\r\nagain,--if good laws are made for their protection, and these laws\r\nare properly enforced. At present there is no doubt the fisheries\r\nare rapidly declining, and in some rivers which used to have a\r\ngood many Salmon in them, and which used to swarm with Smolts (or\r\nfry) in the spring within my remembrance, they are now rarely\r\nseen. To show their scarcity I may mention a circumstance which\r\noccurred in the Wharfe, which was formerly one of the finest\r\nrivers in Yorkshire for Salmon. A few years ago a pair of Salmon\r\nwere seen on a spawning bed in the Wharfe, about forty miles from\r\nits mouth. This became known at the anglers' club, and it was\r\ndeemed so important to preserve them, that the club divided\r\nthemselves into three or four watches, and guarded the spawning\r\nbed night and day, whilst the fish were spawning, and this\r\nspawning lasted about a week.\r\n\r\nHere in the Ribble the Salmon fisheries are not quite so near\r\nextinction (though they are rapidly progressing in that\r\ndirection), for although we are very seldom allowed to see or\r\ncatch fish in seasonable condition, a good many come up the river\r\nto spawn, though very few of them ever do so, and very few of\r\nthose that do ever reach the sea again. The reason is obvious, no\r\none here has any interest in preserving the spawning fish, and\r\nthey are openly killed by the poachers, who never dream of being\r\nprosecuted for it. I am credibly informed that in a stream not\r\nfive hundred yards from where I write, sixty spawning fish were\r\nkilled last winter. Some years ago one gang of poachers killed\r\nthree hundred Salmon on the spawning beds in one season, and sold\r\npotted Salmon roe (which is a most destructive bait for Trout) to\r\nthe value of L20.\r\n\r\nIn the Lune the proprietors of the fisheries near Lancaster sent\r\nmen to protect the spawning fish in the streams above; but these\r\nmen were warned off by the landed proprietors, who said, If you\r\ncatch all the good fish you must at least allow us to catch the\r\nbad ones. In the Tweed and its tributaries it used to be quite as\r\nbad (what the new Scotch law has done I do not know), but a\r\npoacher who gave evidence before the Committee of the House of\r\nCommons in 1825 said that he had assisted to take four hundred\r\nSalmon at one haul in close time in the Tweed.\r\n\r\nSir Walter Scott's vivid description of burning the water, which\r\noccurs in \"Guy Mannering,\" shows that he knew how to kill Salmon\r\nin close time. In fact, his account, and that of Hogg (the Ettrick\r\nShepherd), show that both were regular black fishers.\r\n\r\nThere are various devices for killing the fish in close time: they\r\nare speared, netted, and hooked on the spawning beds, and when the\r\nrivers get low, gangs of idle fellows range up and down on the\r\nbanks, stoning and beating the water by poles, or, what is more\r\neffective still, a large bone, or horse's skull, and by fastening\r\na cord to it, one end of which is passed to each side of the\r\nriver, they draw this skull up and down in the pools where they\r\nknow there are Salmon, and the fish are so foolish and timid, that\r\nthey thrust their heads under any stone or cover they can find,\r\nand are taken without trouble; it being common enough in such\r\ncases to slip a noose over the tail, then tightening it, and the\r\nfish is hauled out immediately.\r\n\r\nThen again, gentlemen who want to have the reputation of being\r\nskilful anglers, employ their game-keepers to find the Kippers\r\n(Scottice Kelts) or spawned fish in the pools, which is a very\r\neasy matter in low water, and dropping a hook baited with a lob\r\nworm before their noses, it is greedily taken, and the poor fish\r\n(which are unfit for food) are caught. It is then trumpeted forth\r\nto the angling world that Mr. A. B. has had splendid sport--he has\r\ncaught a dozen Salmon with the rod in a single day, meaning it to\r\nbe understood that these fish have been caught with the fly. I by\r\nno means uphold these practices, neither do I think them very\r\ndeserving of censure in the present state of the law, for all the\r\ngood fish are taken near the mouths of the rivers.\r\n\r\nThis leads me to consider the defects of the present law, which is\r\nby no means adapted to protect and increase the breed of Salmon.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the close time is too short. It commences in\r\nthe Ribble nominally (for in reality the fish are openly killed\r\nall the year through) on the 15th September, and ends on the 31st\r\nof December; whereas it ought to extend to the end of April, for\r\nthe following reasons. A very large proportion of the fish are\r\nspawning in January and February, and I have even seen a spawning\r\nfish as late as the 3rd of April. In the evidence given before the\r\nHouse of Commons in 1825, it was proved by a fisherman from the\r\nTweed, that in March for one clean fish that was caught there were\r\nten caught that were not so, as they were either fish that had not\r\nspawned, or Kelts, that is, fish which have finished spawning but\r\nhave not returned to the sea, and are then flabby, unwholesome,\r\nand unfit for food. A very large proportion of these Kippers or\r\nKelts do not go to the sea until April, and not then without there\r\nis a fresh in the river, for, like the Smolts, they seem disposed\r\nto remain in the rivers until they can avail themselves of the\r\nassistance of a flood, to enable them more easily to reach the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nAnother defect in the present law is that it fails to secure a\r\nsupply of good fish to the upper proprietors. There are no\r\nprovisions in it (or they are not enforced) for giving the fish a\r\nfree passage, no prohibition of nets, traps, or devices for\r\nstopping them in their progress up the rivers. No daily or weekly\r\nclose time, but everywhere there is so short-sighted a selfishness,\r\nthat it is completely realizing the fable of the man who killed the\r\ngoose which laid the golden egg. The fisheries are declining so\r\nrapidly, that unless something is done, and done quickly, the breed\r\nof Salmon will be extinct in the rivers in this neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nAgain, there is no power to appoint or pay conservators, and\r\nwithout their assistance there is no chance of preserving Salmon\r\nin the spawning beds. Game-keepers are most certainly not to be\r\ndepended upon.\r\n\r\nIn pointing out the defects of the present laws I have, in fact,\r\ngiven an opinion how they should be remedied. I would extend the\r\nclose time from the end of September to the end of April. I would\r\nestablish a daily close time, allowing no net, device, or engine\r\nto be employed in taking Salmon between sunset and sunrise above\r\ntideway in any river; and below, I would only allow nets to be set\r\nfor twelve hours per diem. I would appoint conservators, whom I\r\nwould pay by a tax on the fisheries on the whole course of the\r\nriver, which tax should be determined by a valuation of the\r\nfisheries, and paid accordingly. I would fine every one who sold,\r\nused, or had in his possession any potted or prepared Salmon roe\r\nfor the purpose of angling, and I would give conservators the\r\npower of examining all mill goits and races, for the purpose of\r\nseeing that no unfair practices were resorted to for the taking of\r\nSalmon or Salmon fry; and I would give the upper proprietors the\r\npower of making any alterations in mill weirs and dams which did\r\nnot impair their stability or the efficiency of the water power.\r\nIf some such enactments as these were made and properly enforced,\r\nthere is no doubt Salmon would swarm in every river, for their\r\nfecundity is such, that a very few Salmon spawning in a river\r\nunder favourable circumstances stock it abundantly with Smolts. A\r\nlarge Salmon having not less than 25,000 eggs in it, how soon,\r\nwith a little forbearance and care, would every river swarm with\r\nthis delicious fish, even to such a degree as to be a cheap food\r\nfor the poor! But to obtain such results it must be made the\r\ninterest of every person to protect them.\r\n\r\nIn reading over the evidence on the Salmon fisheries, which was\r\ngiven before the House of Commons in 1825, I was exceedingly\r\namused by the reasons given by the tenants of some of the\r\nfisheries in Scotland why there should be no weekly close time,\r\nand the shifts and evasions practiced by others. One said he paid\r\nL7,000 a year rent to the Duke of Gordon for his fishery, and if\r\none day in the week were allowed for close time he would lose\r\nL1,000 a year. Another said he kept the close time, but he would\r\nallow nobody to go and see whether he kept the free gap open or\r\nnot. Another proved that he kept open the free passage, but it was\r\nalso proved that he had a crocodile placed in the gap, painted\r\nwith very glaring colours, in order to frighten back any fish that\r\nattempted to pass. Another sent his boats to break down the stake\r\nnets which were set in the estuary, but acknowledged that he kept\r\nhis own nets set across the river day and night. There would be no\r\ndifficulty in stocking every suitable river in the kingdom with\r\nSalmon, either by putting into them a few pairs of breeding fish,\r\nor by artificially fecundating the eggs, and placing them in\r\nartificial spawning beds. It is a plan I have frequently adopted,\r\nand sometimes successfully; but in other experiments I have\r\nfailed, from the difficulty of choosing a suitable locality in the\r\nriver. If too rapid a stream was chosen, the eggs and gravel were\r\nall washed away; and if too calm and still a place was selected,\r\nthe gravel was filled up with sand and mud, and the eggs rotted\r\ninstead of hatching. I am even of opinion that where there is\r\nalready a breed of Salmon fry in a river, it is not absolutely\r\nnecessary that any male Salmon should come up the river in the\r\nspawning season, the male Par, or Penks, as we call them in the\r\nRibble, being sufficient to fecundate the eggs. If this is\r\ndoubted, I would ask how it happens that in the autumn they have\r\nfluid milt in them? for as nature makes no unnecessary provisions,\r\nfor what purpose is this, if not to provide for the possibility of\r\na female Salmon coming alone? These Pars swarm on the Salmon\r\nspawning beds.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nSUGGESTIONS FOR AN ALTERATION IN THE LAWS REGARDING SALMON.\r\n\r\nCLITHEROE, _October 12th_, 1851.\r\n\r\nTo the Editor of the \"Gardeners' Chronicle.\"\r\n\r\nAs the amusement of fly-fishing is one which holds a first place\r\nin the opinion of every one who understands it, and as the Trout\r\nand the Salmon are the only fish which afford genuine sport to the\r\nangler, and as I believe that the latter in some of the southern\r\ncounties is nearly extinct, whilst the former is far from being\r\nabundant, I wish to call the attention of such of your readers as\r\nare possessed by the true _piscatorial furor_, to the facility\r\nwith which these fish can be bred artificially. And as many\r\nexperiments have been made under my direction, and having\r\nwitnessed the results, I unhesitatingly say that there is little\r\nrisk of failure, if due care be taken.\r\n\r\nThe experiments of Shaw and Agassiz, my own also included, have\r\nproved that fish can be bred artificially. The experiments of\r\nBoccius I have not yet tried, although he proposes to arrive at\r\nthe same result in another manner, and acting in the manner\r\nrecommended by them, Trout and Salmon have been bred by thousands\r\nduring the last ten years.\r\n\r\nAs the season for making the experiment will shortly be here, I\r\nhope that those who intend to try the plan will lose no time in\r\nlooking after their supply of breeding fish.\r\n\r\nTo begin with Trout:--Catch as many as you can conveniently obtain\r\nupon the spawning beds, [6] and examine them carefully one by one,\r\nto see that the spawn and milt are in a fit state for exclusion;\r\nand also to enable you to separate the males from the females. If\r\nthey are in a fit state to be operated upon (which may be known by\r\nthe facility with which the milt and the roe run from them on a\r\nslight pressure), squeeze the milt of the males into a little\r\nwater, and when you have obtained all the milt you can get, add so\r\nmuch water that the mixture remains slightly opalescent--say about\r\nequal in colour to a tablespoonful of milk mixed in a quart of\r\nwater; pour this into a deep dish or bowl, large enough to hold\r\nthe largest of your female Trouts; take one of these and put it\r\ninto the water so prepared, and gently squeeze the roe from it\r\nwhilst the vent is immersed in the water. [7] Do this as quickly as\r\npossible, and return the fish into fresh water, and then pour off\r\nthe water containing the impregnated roe, through a strainer,\r\ncarefully preserving it for the remaining fish, and immediately\r\nreturn the roe into fresh spring or brook water. Repeat the\r\noperation for every female Trout, and you will then have a\r\nquantity of impregnated roe, which if properly managed will hatch\r\nwith great certainty. Have ready as many boxes as you are able to\r\nstock with spawn (three feet long, two feet broad, and six inches\r\ndeep). Fill them to the depth of two inches of river sand, which\r\nought to be previously so well washed that there is not a particle\r\nof mud left in it, and upon that put two inches of river gravel,\r\nalso exceedingly well washed, the pebbles varying in size from a\r\nhazel nut to a pigeon or pullet's egg. These boxes must be so\r\nplaced that the water from a spring will flow into the first, and\r\nfrom the surface of that into the second, and below the whole nest\r\nof boxes there ought to be a small reservoir made--say three yards\r\nby two and eighteen inches deep, and well gravelled at the bottom.\r\nAll these matters having been previously arranged, and the water\r\nflowing nicely over the gravel, sprinkle the impregnated roe\r\nequally over the surface of the gravel, say a quarter of a pint to\r\neach box, and it will roll down into the interstices of the gravel\r\nand find a bed in which it will remain snugly until the spring,\r\nwhen, about March, if all has been properly managed, you will\r\nfind, on a careful examination, that the young Trout are coming to\r\nlife by hundreds. I am very particular in recommending spring\r\nrather than brook water, for several reasons. In the first place,\r\nbrooks are liable to be flooded, and are sometimes so overcharged\r\nwith sand and mud that the gravel in the spawning-boxes is\r\ncompletely choked with it and the spawn is lost, as I know to my\r\ngreat and frequent disappointments. At other times all is washed\r\naway together. In the second place, the gravel of brooks swarms\r\nwith water-lice (shrimps) and the larvae of aquatic insects, as\r\nwell as bull-heads and loaches, all of which prey upon the spawn\r\nof the Trout and Salmon. In the third place, if you put your\r\nspawning-boxes in a brook, you will find it difficult to prevent\r\nthe escape of the fry when hatched, and you are left in doubt as\r\nto the success of your experiment. With spring water all these\r\ninconveniences are avoided. But if your watercourse should contain\r\nwater-lice or aquatic larvae, it is a very easy matter to destroy\r\nthem before putting in your boxes, with a little salt or\r\nquicklime. It is also desirable to cover your spawning-boxes with\r\na wire grating, to exclude the light, and to protect them in\r\nsevere weather from the chance of being frozen.\r\n\r\nWhen they begin to hatch, open a communication between the boxes\r\nand the little reservoir below, and if this communicates with a\r\nwatercourse in which aquatic plants are growing, so much the\r\nbetter. The fry, as soon as they are strong enough, will make\r\ntheir way into this ditch, and will find abundance of food among\r\nthe water plants; thence they ought to be able to make their way\r\ninto the brook, river, or lake which it is intended to store with\r\nthem. All ducks, wild and tame, should be driven from this ditch,\r\nor few of the Trout will be allowed to find their way to their\r\nfinal place of destination.\r\n\r\nThese rules, with some modification, are applicable to the\r\nbreeding of Salmon as well as Trout; the only difference being in\r\nthe mode of placing the female fish, when obtaining the roe, and\r\nthe size of the gravel in which the spawn is deposited in the\r\nboxes. The Salmon is too large a fish to put into the vessels in\r\nwhich the diluted milt is placed, but I think that she should be\r\nheld by an assistant, in such a manner that the tail and lower\r\npart of the body up to the vent are immersed in the water\r\ncontaining the milt. And it is also very necessary to hold her\r\nfirmly, otherwise a large fish, in the struggles which it makes to\r\nget free, is apt to upset the vessel containing the milt, and then\r\nthe experiment is at an end, at least for the time. Being held\r\nfirmly by the assistant, as above stated, the belly of the fish\r\nmust be gently pressed by the hands to promote the exclusion of\r\nthe spawn, which on exclusion must be gently stirred in the\r\ndiluted milt, to bring every grain into contact with it; but the\r\nroe ought not to remain in contact with the milt a minute, if it\r\ncan sooner be got out, as I have found that if the diluted milt be\r\ntoo strong, or if the ova remain too long in contact with it, they\r\nbecome opaque, and never hatch at all, apparently because they are\r\nover-impregnated. In the ordinary way in which Salmon and Trout\r\nare bred, the milt must be largely diluted with water, and the\r\ncontact between the milt and ova can only be momentary, for the\r\nstreams in which these fish spawn (particularly the Salmon) are so\r\nrapid, that the milt on exclusion must be carried away immediately.\r\n\r\nThere is another method, which is preferred by Ramsbottom, to the\r\none I have been describing, and it is certainly less troublesome.\r\nThis is to take the ova from the female fish in the first place\r\n(taking care to exclude the air from it, by immersing the fish\r\ninto water up to the vent), and when all the roe has been\r\ncollected into a large bowl or basin, then mix the milt with it,\r\nthe same diluted in the proportion which has been before\r\ndescribed, namely, until the water which covers the roe becomes\r\nlightly opalescent.\r\n\r\nI am quite aware that there is another theory which assumes that\r\nimpregnation takes place twelve months before the exclusion of the\r\nova. [8] But a very careful and long continued examination of the\r\nspawning of minnows and lampreys (I have never been able closely\r\nto examine the spawning of Salmon), convinces me that it is not a\r\ncorrect one. Besides, did any one ever succeed in hatching the ova\r\nof a fish which had not been allowed to come in contact with milt\r\nafter exclusion? If they have, when, where, and how has this been\r\naccomplished, and where is it recorded? I know that I could never\r\nsucceed, although I have often tried the experiment. On the other\r\nhand, it is the easiest thing imaginable, with due care and a\r\nsuitable situation, to hatch those which have been properly\r\nimpregnated after exclusion. But if, to avoid argument, I admit\r\nthat this theory is correct, it will not at all interfere with\r\nartificial breeding of Trout and Salmon; on the contrary, it will\r\nmaterially facilitate it. It will only be necessary to catch\r\nfemale fish with the ova ready for exclusion, and place these ova\r\nin clean gravel in a box, as before described, but there will be\r\nno occasion for males. But supposing Trout and Salmon can be bred\r\nin this manner, which I by no means believe, there would be no\r\nmeans of breeding hybrids, which I consider a far more important\r\nachievement, and to which I will now refer.\r\n\r\nEver since my attention was turned to the artificial breeding of\r\nfish, it has always appeared to me exceedingly desirable and\r\nimportant to breed hybrids between the Trout and the Salmon. The\r\nfry of the Salmon, which, by-the-bye, is perhaps the most\r\ndelicately flavoured fish that exists in this country, although it\r\nlives and thrives in fresh water for two or three years, if kept\r\nin a locality where it cannot escape to the sea, yet, if kept\r\nlonger than that time, pines away and dies. If, therefore, we\r\ncould obtain a hybrid fish, bred between the river Trout and the\r\nSalmon, we should probably produce a fish which, being a mule,\r\nwould be always in good condition; being crossed with a river\r\nfish, it would probably never require a visit to salt water to\r\nkeep it in good health. Being crossed with a Salmon, it ought to\r\nget to a good size in a comparatively short period; and, if it\r\nwould rise at the artificial fly, or the minnow, ought to afford\r\nfirst-rate sport to the angler.\r\n\r\nThere does not appear to be a greater specific difference between\r\nthe Trout and the Salmon than there is between the horse and the\r\nass, between the mallard and the musk duck, or between a cabbage\r\nand a turnip. But hitherto, in all my experiments, I have never\r\nsucceeded in producing a hybrid between the Trout and the\r\nSalmon. [9] Yet I do not despair of doing so, for there was always\r\na something to complain of, and to doubt about, in every one I\r\ntried, and I still think I shall succeed by perseverance. Even if\r\nI shall succeed, the result may not prove quite so favourable as I\r\nanticipate, but may turn out as unfortunately as the marriage of\r\nthe gentleman in the story, which relates that, being good-\r\ntempered but ugly himself, he married a handsome ill-tempered\r\nwife, hoping that his children would have his good-temper and\r\ntheir mother's good looks; but when they came, they were as ugly\r\nas the father and as ill-tempered as the mother. So it may prove\r\nwith these hybrids--they may not always thrive in fresh water;\r\nthey may not grow to a good size; they may not rise at the\r\nartificial fly; they may be worthless for the table. Nevertheless,\r\nit is desirable if possible that this should be ascertained. The\r\nprogeny of a male Salmon and a female Trout may be much better or\r\nmuch worse fitted for a continual residence in fresh water than\r\nthe descendants of a male Trout and a female Salmon; but this can\r\nonly be determined by experiment. Dr. Lindley says, in his\r\nintroduction to the \"Guide to the Orchard,\" that in the cross\r\nfertilization of fruits, the seedlings always partake more of the\r\ncharacter of the male than of the female parent. But I believe\r\nthat in breeding mules it is found more desirable that the father\r\nshould be an ass than a horse. In my poultry yard I breed hybrids\r\nbetween the musk duck and the common duck, and I find that I have\r\na much better progeny from the musk drake and the common duck than\r\nfrom the common drake and the musk duck. In the latter cross,\r\nalthough the males are fine birds, the females are not larger than\r\na widgeon, and fly about almost like wild ducks. This may not\r\nalways be the case, but it has proved so with me.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the fish. If any gentleman who is interested in\r\nsuch matters will do me the honour to read this paper, and wishes\r\nfor further information on the subject, I shall be happy to give\r\nit, so far as I am able. Very sure I am that the sportsman who\r\nonce fairly starts as a fly-fisher, and is so fortunate as to hook\r\na Salmon or a large Trout, will thenceforward despise or lightly\r\nesteem corks and floats, ground-bait and trimmers, punts and Perch\r\nfishing, and will fairly wish them all exchanged for a nice stream\r\nwell stocked with Trout--as a gentleman lately said to me, fly-\r\nfishing is a perfect infatuation! He was quite right. The extreme\r\navidity with which it is followed by the thoroughly initiated, can\r\nonly be explained on that supposition; to the casual observer,\r\nthere does not appear to be any strong excitement in it. But that\r\nis a great mistake. Let me get to the bank of a river well stocked\r\nwith Trout in a good humour, early in the morning, and I feel\r\nneither hunger, thirst, nor fatigue if I fish until dark without\r\ntasting of anything. And the excitement of hooking a ten or twelve\r\npound Salmon is not much inferior to that produced by a long run\r\nafter the hounds.\r\n\r\nI cannot conclude without calling the attention of all interested,\r\nand who are able to render assistance in remedying the evil, to\r\nthe great falling off in the quantity of fish there is in all the\r\nSalmon rivers in England. With those in Scotland and Ireland I am\r\nnot acquainted, but believe that matters are not in a much better\r\nstate there. I believe that the unsatisfactory state of the laws\r\nhas a great deal to do with this decline in the value of the\r\nfisheries, and I also believe that it is quite possible so to\r\nalter the law as to very greatly improve them, and that without\r\nimproperly interfering with what is of far more importance--I mean\r\nthe manufactories of the country. As the law stands at present the\r\nproprietors of the upper parts of rivers have not the slightest\r\ninterest in the preservation of the fish in the breeding season,\r\nfor, as they are seldom allowed to see a fish when it is fit for\r\nthe table, why should they look after the poachers in close time?\r\nWhy should they be put to much expense and trouble, as well as the\r\nrisk of the lives of their game-keepers, merely to breed fish for\r\nthe proprietors of stake nets and estuary fisheries, who don't\r\nspend a farthing in the preservation of the fish when breeding,\r\nand yet reap all the benefit? I had occasion, some years ago, to\r\nexamine the evidence on this subject given before the House of\r\nCommons in 1825, and was exceedingly amused at the schemes\r\nresorted to to evade the law, moderate and inefficient as was the\r\nlaw at that time. (Since then the law has been altered both in\r\nScotland and Ireland, but I do not know what are the provisions,\r\nnor what has been the effect of the new law.) It required that\r\nthere should be a free passage for the fish (Salmon) through all\r\nthe traps, nets, weirs, and devices that were used to catch or\r\ndetain them, from sunset on Saturday night to sunrise on Monday\r\nmorning. One man said he paid L7,000 a year for his fishery, and\r\nshould lose one-seventh of his catch. Another said he allowed a\r\nfree passage on Sundays, but would not permit anybody to go and\r\nexamine for themselves. A third proved that he allowed the fish a\r\nfree passage on Sundays, but his neighbours proved that he placed\r\nin the gap a crocodile, painted red. And a fourth was convicted of\r\nbreaking down the stake nets in the estuary of a river--at the\r\nsame time he had a net stretched entirely across the river above,\r\nboth day and night. And so with many others, every one striving\r\nwith all his might to kill the goose that laid the golden eggs.\r\n\r\nThis is not the way to improve the Salmon fisheries. To do this\r\neffectually the upper proprietors must have a strong interest in\r\nthe preservation of the breeding of fish, and in order to give\r\nthem this interest they ought to have an ample supply of fish when\r\nthey are in the best condition; but to give them this supply the\r\nlaw ought to be altered. At present I believe the law does not\r\nrequire a free passage for the fish (at least in English rivers)\r\nexcept from Saturday night to Monday morning; in many of them I\r\nbelieve this is not insisted upon; whereas the law ought to\r\nprohibit fishing for or obstructing the passage of the fish every\r\nnight from sunset to sunrise, and this regulation ought to be\r\nrigorously enforced. This would give the upper proprietors a\r\nchance of having good fish, and a corresponding inducement to take\r\ncare of them. Nobody would be so much benefited as the owners of\r\nfisheries at the mouths of rivers; they would be the first takers,\r\nand would still get the lion's share of all the fish that ascended\r\nthe river. If this regulation were enforced, the expenses of\r\nconservators might be defrayed by levying a small tax, in the\r\nshape of a licence for angling, which all true sportsmen would be\r\nglad to pay if it gave a reasonable prospect of a well-stocked\r\nriver. Now matters are getting worse every day, and notwithstanding\r\nthe enormous fecundity of the Salmon (a large one producing 25,000\r\nova in a season), they are now extinct in some rivers where they\r\nused to be found in my recollection, and in others where they were\r\nonce abundant they are now very scarce. No one need to wonder at\r\nthis, when he is told that gangs of poachers are on the look-out\r\nfor them all through the spawning season. In one winter, some\r\nyears ago, I am credibly informed that two hundred Salmon were\r\ntaken in one stream within five hundred yards of the spot where\r\nI am now writing. It is nobody's business and nobody's interest to\r\nprevent this, and therefore it goes on openly night and day.\r\n\r\nAre there no influential gentlemen in the House of Commons who\r\nwill take up this matter and endeavour to get an equitable and\r\ncomprehensive law passed for the preservation and increase of the\r\nbreed of Salmon? It is a matter of even national importance, and\r\nif duly provided for and properly attended to, I see no\r\nimprobability in the supposition that Salmon would again be as\r\nabundant as they were when the apprentices on the banks of the\r\nRibble stipulated that they should not be compelled to eat Salmon\r\noftener than three days in the week. The apathy of country\r\ngentlemen in this matter is to me unaccountable. I have some\r\nreason to believe, however, that Government have at all times been\r\nso far from lending their influence to the promotion of any\r\nattempts to amend these laws, that they have obstructed rather\r\nthan assisted them, most probably from an idea that the\r\npreservation of the fish would interfere with manufactories. If I\r\nthought that this would be the case, I should not say a word on\r\nthe subject; but I am very far from holding such an opinion. So\r\nfar from this being the case, I assert without hesitation that\r\nweirs need form no obstruction to the free passage of fish, and\r\nthat without impairing the efficiency of the water power. With the\r\npoisonous and filthy mixtures sent by some manufactories down the\r\nrivers, the case is far different, and where this is done the case\r\nis hopeless. Salmon and Trout will rapidly disappear from such\r\nrivers, never to be seen there again, so long as these noxious\r\ncontaminations are permitted to flow into them.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nARTIFICIAL BREEDING OF FISH.\r\n\r\nCLITHEROE, _December 26th_, 1853.\r\n\r\nTo the Editor of the \"Manchester Guardian.\"\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have read with some interest the letter of your\r\ncorrespondent, Salmo Salar, on the artificial breeding of fish;\r\nand knowing, as I do, the great interest which the writer feels in\r\nthe preservation and increase of his namesakes, I shall be most\r\nhappy if my humble efforts in the same cause throw any more light\r\non the same subject, and in any degree contribute to the same end.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Salmo Salar is quite wrong in saying that, with the\r\nexceptions of the experiments made on the banks of the Hodder, by\r\nRamsbottom, no efforts have been made to increase the number of\r\nSalmon by providing artificial breeding-places. Passing over my\r\nown numerous experiments here for the last fourteen or fifteen\r\nyears (which you, Sir, are aware of, though the fishing world is\r\nnot), I may refer to the extensive experiments made by Mr. Fawkes,\r\nof Farnley, in 1841 and 1842, and renewed again in 1848 and 1849;\r\nand the whole of which (with the exception of a portion of these\r\nin 1842) were successful. The experiments of Salmo Salar were not\r\nmade until 1851 and 1852, and were intended merely to test the\r\naccuracy of an assumption that the impregnation of the ova takes\r\nplace long prior to their exclusion; which experiments terminated\r\nin a complete failure. Salmo Salar says that the quantity of\r\nSalmon fry in the river is enormous; and that he has caught five\r\npounds of them in a single pool in a single day. I have known\r\nthree times that quantity caught in the same way. But still this\r\nproves nothing at all, for it is well known that almost all\r\nmigratory animals, however solitary their general habits may be,\r\nare gregarious at the time of migration. Witness swallows,\r\nfieldfares, and even woodcocks. Witness also the clouds of small\r\nEels ascending the rivers in May and June; and if we are to\r\nbelieve the accounts of travellers, the enormous flocks of\r\nantelopes in Africa, and of bisons in America, are proofs of the\r\nsame general law. No doubt Salmo Salar will find, as he says, that\r\nthe Samlets are exceedingly abundant in some of the pools, when\r\nthey have flocked together for the purpose of migration; but he\r\nmay perhaps travel for miles either up or down the river before he\r\nwill find any more. It is notorious that, in the tributaries of\r\nthe Hodder, they are walled in, in many places, for the purpose of\r\ndetaining them, that unscrupulous anglers may get as many of them\r\nas possible before they go to the sea. Salmo Salar is in error\r\nalso when he says that Ramsbottom deposited 40,000 in the ponds of\r\nGalway, of which 20,000 are expected to be fruitful. The fact is,\r\nthat he deposited 40,000 in December, 1852, of which above 20,000\r\nare now alive and in the ponds, varying from four to five inches\r\nlong to two or three, notwithstanding that experiment was made\r\nunder very unfavourable circumstances; for there was so much mud\r\nin the stream that supplied the spawning-boxes, that when\r\nRamsbottom left Galway he was afraid all the ova would be choked\r\nby it.\r\n\r\nSalmo Salar seems to think that almost all the ova deposited\r\nnaturally come to life, and that very few of those deposited\r\nartificially do so. This, however, is quite contrary to my\r\nexperience, and I think that if Salmo Salar will listen to the\r\nevidence he will change his opinion. It is well known that\r\nSalmon are very fond of particular streams, their instinct no\r\ndoubt informing them which are suitable to their purpose; and when\r\none pair of fish have finished spawning, another pair will come\r\nand occupy the same place. Now, what takes place under such\r\ncircumstances? The ova which were deposited by the first pair are\r\nrooted up by the second, and their specific gravity is so near\r\nthat of the water, that they roll down out of the loose gravel and\r\nare picked up by the Trouts, Par, and other fish that are always\r\nlying in wait just below for that purpose. When Ramsbottom was in\r\nGalway he caught a large Trout, out of whose throat he squeezed a\r\nthousand ova, which were deposited in a spawning-box, many of\r\nwhich came to life notwithstanding the pit they had escaped from.\r\nThe extraordinary avidity with which Trout take Salmon roe as a\r\nbait is also a proof (if that were needed) of their preying upon\r\nit in the spawning beds. Yet, in addition to them, are all the\r\nPar, Bullheads, Eels, Loaches, and aquatic larvae which may be\r\nfound swarming in every spawning bed by any one who will look for\r\nthem. In addition to these enemies, millions of the ova are\r\ndestroyed by being washed away by heavy floods, and as many more\r\nare destroyed by being choked with mud and sand in the spawning\r\nbeds as well as by being left dry at low water owing to the Salmon\r\nspawning in places which frequently become quite dry in early\r\nspring. No doubt many of the Salmon fry when they have reached the\r\nsea are destroyed by enemies there, of which we know nothing. But\r\nstill, if 500,000 are bred, in addition to all that are reared\r\nnaturally, it will represent a larger proportion of the whole than\r\nSalmo Salar seems to suppose; otherwise, how is it that in rivers\r\nwhere Salmon are protected, or still more in unsettled countries,\r\nthe Salmon are so numerous? The Salmon in the Columbia river, on\r\nthe north-west coast of America, are cast dead upon the shores by\r\nmyriads after the spawning season, and these are merely the fish\r\ndying from exhaustion, as a small portion always do here. How\r\nnumerous, then, are those which ascend the river to spawn, and go\r\ndown again to the sea afterwards! No doubt the grand object to be\r\nattained is to make Salmon abundant, and the most important step\r\ntowards the attainment of this object will be to give an efficient\r\nprotection to the spawning fish, and the only way to do this\r\neffectually is to give the upper proprietors of rivers such an\r\ninterest in the Salmon fisheries as will make them worth\r\nattention. At present this is far from being the case. Now the\r\nupper proprietors are merely considered as so many clucking hens,\r\nwhose business and whose duty it is to hatch Salmon for the\r\nproprietors of fisheries at the mouths of rivers, who do not in\r\nmany cases spend a farthing in their protection when spawning, and\r\nwho grievously begrudge the upper proprietors every fish that is\r\nable to pass their nets and other engines of destruction. Let the\r\nupper proprietors of Salmon rivers bestir themselves so to amend\r\nthe law as to give them a chance of having a supply of Salmon when\r\nthey are in season. They cannot and will not have a more efficient\r\nally than Salmo Salar. Salmo Salar is in my opinion quite right\r\nwhen he says that the fish kept in ponds will not be quite so well\r\nable to take care of themselves as fish which have been bred and\r\nlived all their lives in the river. Nor do I think that this is\r\nnecessary for any longer period than until the young fry get rid\r\nof the umbilical vessel; after which they are quite able to take\r\ncare of themselves. Before that time they are scarcely able to\r\nmove, and thousands of them fall a prey, not only to the other\r\nfish, but to the larvae of aquatic insects which prey upon them\r\nvery greedily. As I happen to know from my own observations, the\r\nlarva of the stone fly (May fly of Lancashire) and those of all\r\nthe larger ephemera (drakes), to say nothing of the fresh-water\r\nshrimps, swarm in all the spawning beds, and no doubt destroy\r\nmyriads of the ova. All these would be saved by proper precautions\r\nand well formed spawning-boxes, with good supplies of spring water\r\nto feed them.\r\n\r\nI think Salmo Salar has very greatly over-estimated the quantity\r\nof Salmon fry that go down to the sea from the rivers. He speaks\r\nof them going down by millions. Now we will take the river Hodder\r\nas a river with which both Salmo Salar and myself are well\r\nacquainted, and I will venture to say that, so far is this an\r\nover-estimate, that if he would take the hundredth part of the\r\nnumber he would be much nearer the truth. The Samlets when they go\r\nto the sea may be reckoned to weigh eight to the pound, and two\r\nmillions would at that rate weigh one hundred and ten tons. Does\r\nSalmo Salar think that one ton and a tenth of Smolts go down the\r\nriver Hodder to the sea on an average of years? I have more\r\nfavourable means of judging of the quantity that go down the river\r\nRibble than I have of those of the Hodder, and I believe I should\r\nvery greatly exaggerate their numbers if I estimated them at any\r\nsuch weight as a fourth of that quantity. Again, the Hodder and\r\nthe Ribble are, in some respects, far more favourable for spawning\r\nthan many other rivers; for partly owing to the country through\r\nwhich they pass, and partly owing to the rapidity of their\r\nstreams, the gravel is large and very suitable for spawning in;\r\nthere is also far less mud and sand in them, and the spawning beds\r\nare much less liable to be choked up than they are in many other\r\nrivers. No doubt the Salmon will make the best selection in their\r\npower, but they can only select from such places as there are; and\r\nif those are not suitable the ova must be in a great measure\r\ndestroyed. Since Ramsbottom returned from Scotland he has visited\r\nthe river Dee, about forty miles from Chester, and there he found\r\nthe spawning beds (ridds as Salmo Salar calls them) silted up with\r\nmud and sand, and the ova buried in them to the depth of eighteen\r\ninches. How or when were the newly hatched fish (supposing, which\r\nis very improbable, that they ever did hatch) to make their escape\r\nfrom such a heap of filth? It would be quite impossible.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it seems desirable and quite necessary to say a few\r\nwords as to the priority of discovery of this process of fish\r\npropagation. The French claim it; the Irish seem to claim it; the\r\nMessrs. Ashworth take great credit for it; and now Salmo Salar\r\nsays he first suggested it. Allow me, as there are so many\r\nclaimants in the field, to suggest one or two more. In the year\r\n1832, without knowing that such a thing had ever been done or even\r\nthought of, I made some experiments on the spawning of fish and\r\nthe artificial impregnation of their ova, which I communicated to\r\n\"Loudon's Magazine of Natural History,\" in which they appeared.\r\nAfter that came the Duke of Buccleuch's game-keeper, Shaw, whose\r\nexperiments were both satisfactory and conclusive. This was in\r\n1836 or 1838. Then after my experiments at home, I induced Mr.\r\nFawkes to take up the matter in 1841, and they were resumed in\r\n1842, and again in 1848 and 1849, both with Salmon and Trout. It\r\nwas at this period that Ramsbottom came into the field. At Mr.\r\nFawkes's request I instructed him in the art, and sent him to\r\nFarnley, where he was perfectly successful; and since then, I\r\nbelieve he has had more experience and been more successful than\r\nany other propagator in the kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe principle of this system is very easily comprehended; but\r\nsuccess depends on many niceties of manipulation, and much\r\nexperience in judging whether the fish, both male and female, are\r\nin the proper condition for operating upon.\r\n\r\nThis experience is not gained without much practice. This practice\r\nRamsbottom has in great perfection. There is no doubt the\r\nartificial breeding of fish will be found exceedingly beneficial,\r\nif properly carried out; and I hope to see the time when Salmo\r\nSalar may catch half-a-dozen of his namesakes at Whitewell, any\r\ngood day in the season.\r\n\r\nI am, Sir,\r\nYours very truly,\r\nTHOMAS GARNETT.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nARTIFICIAL BREEDING OF FISH--(CONTINUED).\r\n\r\nCLITHEROE, _9th January_, 1854.\r\n\r\nTo the Editor of the \"Manchester Guardian.\"\r\n\r\nSIR,--As I believe that Salmo Salar is quite as desirous of\r\nincreasing the breed of Salmon as myself, the controversy between\r\nus may be reduced to very narrow limits. He believes that Trout\r\neat very few of the Salmon ova, and therefore cannot do much harm.\r\nI will just mention a few facts which make me think otherwise.\r\nWhen Ramsbottom was in Galway he caught in one night twenty-five\r\nTrout on the spawning ground, which had on the average not less\r\nthan five hundred ova in each of their stomachs; from one of their\r\nthroats he squeezed a thousand. As the net would not take a fish\r\nof less than two pounds, how many had passed through it? When he\r\nwas at Knowlmere, in sweeping the river for spawning fish he\r\ncaught nine Par, two Trouts, and a Sprod on the spawning bed, all\r\nof which were gorged with Salmon spawn; when he went into the\r\nbrooks there he never found a pair of Trout spawning without also\r\nfinding a number of smaller fish behind, some of which he caught,\r\nand in all such cases found them gorged with roe up to the throat;\r\nthe male Trout would occasionally drive them off, but as soon as\r\nhe returned to the female they were again close in the rear.\r\n\r\nIn the \"Perthshire Courier\" of the 22nd December is the following\r\nstatement: The men employed in taking the breeding fish secured a\r\nWhitling on Tuesday about three-quarters of a pound, and as they\r\nobserved Salmon ova coming out of his mouth he was brought to the\r\noffice of Mr. Buist for examination; on being opened, upwards of\r\nthree hundred impregnated Salmon ova were taken from his stomach\r\nquite undigested. It may be, therefore, fairly presumed, that this\r\nyoungster had taken this quantity for his breakfast; if he dined\r\nand breakfasted in the same style each day during the breeding\r\nseason, it is difficult to estimate the expense of his keep. Such\r\nis the amount of loss of impregnated roe in one morning from one\r\ntrifling fish; what must it be throughout the season from the\r\nvarious enemies it has to encounter?\r\n\r\nSalmo Salar is facetious about the destruction of the roe by\r\ninsects, and says, \"because an aquatic insect will devour a\r\nminnow's egg, which is not as large as a pin's head, we have no\r\nright to infer that it will devour that of a Salmon, which is as\r\nlarge as a pea; it would be just as reasonable to suppose that\r\nbecause a wasp feasts upon a cherry, or a strawberry, therefore he\r\nwill eat a turnip or a mangold wurtzel.\" As he seems to have made\r\na slip of the pen in naming the two last _fruits_, allow me to\r\nsupply what I suppose he meant to say, which I presume was that\r\nbecause a wasp eats a cherry or a strawberry, we must not\r\ntherefore infer that he will either eat a pear or a plum; if that\r\nis his meaning, I think I can understand it. If he adheres to his\r\nown version, I would merely observe that there is no analogy in\r\nthe two cases. But the inference does not rest upon mere\r\nsupposition; the freshwater shrimps at Knowlmere were seen\r\ndevouring the ova in the spawning-boxes. We have seen above that\r\nPar eat ova as well as Trout. Let us suppose that the millions of\r\nSmolts (as Par) have only one meal each of Salmon roe, and we will\r\nstint them to twenty ova apiece. I fear that very few of the five\r\nmillions which Salmo Salar says are deposited in the Hodder will\r\nbe left to grow into Salmon. In addition to these, ducks, both\r\nwild and tame, eat them greedily. When Ramsbottom was in Galway he\r\nsaw that the tame ducks frequented the spawning ford, and the\r\nsuperintendent bought one, and found its crop quite full of Salmon\r\nroe. If this had been buried eighteen inches in the gravel (as\r\nSalmo Salar suggests), the duck would have had some difficulty in\r\nextracting it; but so far as my experience goes, it is not usually\r\none-half that depth, although this varies in different rivers.\r\nThen, if one Salmon is able to plough up gravel which is cemented\r\ntogether by sand and long continuance in one place, why should not\r\nanother be able to do the same when the gravel is loose and easily\r\nremoved? But there is another enemy whom Salmo Salar has not\r\nmentioned, who does more harm than all the rest: that is the\r\npoacher, and I fear that many of the Salmon which Salmo Salar saw\r\nspawning in the Hodder and its tributaries have since then made a\r\njourney overland. At all events, I am credibly informed that in\r\none season a gang of poachers took seventy Salmon in the Hodder.\r\nIs he sure they have taken none this season? Salmo Salar seems to\r\nthink that one pair of Salmon will not spawn on the same ground,\r\nwhich has been previously occupied by another pair; but he has\r\nonly to watch the same ridd for a week or two to be convinced he\r\nis mistaken. As to fish refusing to spawn on new gravel, I may\r\nstate that when Mr. Fawkes was making his experiments at Farnley\r\nhe put some new gravel into his brook, and there were sixteen\r\npairs of Trout spawning on it the next morning. Salmo Salar says\r\nthat if he can have those simple checks which he enumerates to the\r\npresent practices, he will restore abundance of Salmon to the\r\nRibble; they are all very good in their way, but do not go quite\r\nfar enough, and they would do very little good without a fourth,\r\nnamely, protection from the poacher for the fish on the spawning\r\nbeds. Until this can be given more efficiently than it is at\r\npresent, all the rest will be unavailing; and until the upper\r\nproprietors can have a greater interest in the preservation of\r\nSalmon than they now have, they cannot be expected to give\r\nthemselves much trouble on the subject.\r\n\r\nMy readers would not be much edified by strong assertion and\r\ncounter-assertion of what Trout do, and what they cannot do; nor\r\nis it probable that where we differ we should convince each other;\r\nneither do I see any occasion for personality, when both parties\r\nare actuated by the same motives--a desire to see the Salmon\r\nfisheries restored to a state of great prosperity. I therefore\r\navoid noticing some of Salmo Salar's remarks, which seem to me a\r\nlittle tinged with this spirit, and hope we shall be able to act\r\nin concert for the attainment of that desirable result. Salmo\r\nSalar will find that the number of Smolts is not always determined\r\nby the quantity of ova deposited: if he will examine the bed of\r\nthe Hodder the next low water, he will find many of the ridds\r\ndisturbed by the ice floods of yesterday; and if he doubts this, I\r\nshall be happy to examine them along with him, if he will give me\r\nprevious notice of his intention.\r\n\r\nSince the above was written I have seen Ramsbottom, who tells me\r\nthat the stream in the Tay, where he caught the whole of the fish\r\nfrom which he obtained 300,000 to 400,000 ova, was on one side of\r\nit one continuous ridd, and that the fish could not avoid\r\nploughing up the gravel which previous fish had spawned in, and at\r\nOughterard, where 300 pairs of fish spawned in the same number of\r\nyards, it was the same; and they found thousands of ova buried so\r\ndeep that they were rotting in great quantities.\r\n\r\nWith regard to what Salmo Salar says about the infrequency of a\r\nveritable spawning bed being washed away by floods, I refer him to\r\nwhat I have said previously; but Ramsbottom tells me the game-\r\nkeeper at Harden (Haworth) will be able to give him sufficient\r\nproof that in the Langden Brook this has occurred, as he found the\r\nova on the dry land by thousands, which had been left there by the\r\nflood.\r\n\r\nWhen Ramsbottom was at Perth he found on one of the fords, a space\r\nof twenty yards long and fourteen yards wide, filled with ridds,\r\nwhich was entirely left dry. What would become of all the spawn\r\ndeposited there?\r\n\r\nSalmo Salar seems to think nature is quite sufficient to take care\r\nof her own interests without our interference, and that without\r\nsome counter-acting influence to keep the breed of fish in check,\r\nthe river would not hold all that would be bred. I quite agree\r\nwith him in this, provided nature had fair play; but she has not,\r\nand occasionally needs a little help: else why do we employ game-\r\nkeepers to trap cats, foxes, and weasels, to shoot hawks, carrion\r\ncrows, and magpies, and to breed pheasants, as well as to prevent\r\npoaching? If these precautions are unnecessary, why go to such\r\nexpense? and if they are necessary for hares and birds, may they\r\nnot be also for fish?\r\n\r\nI hope Salmo Salar will investigate what I said about walling in\r\nof the Smolts in Langden Brook. I fancy he may have seen these\r\nenclosures himself; at all events, I have, and although I cannot\r\nprove they were erected for that purpose, I do not doubt the\r\naccuracy of my information.\r\n\r\nI am, Sir,\r\nYours very truly,\r\nTHOMAS GARNETT.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nThe following letter was sent to me from Chester:--\r\n\r\nCHESTER, _3rd February_, 1854.\r\n\r\nSIR,--We are about to make application to Parliament for a\r\nCommission of Inquiry into the state of laws respecting the\r\nfisheries of England and Wales. And Mr. Ashworth, of Poynton, has\r\nbeen so good as to refer me to you, as able and willing to furnish\r\nus with information on the subject.\r\n\r\nThe annual meeting of the river Dee fishery association will be\r\nheld on the 20th instant, when I purpose to lay before them the\r\ndraft of a petition to Parliament for their approval.\r\n\r\nI am anxious in the meantime to obtain all the information\r\npossible relative to the working of the present laws, their\r\ndefects, and the alterations to be proposed in them, in order that\r\na condensed statement may be embodied in the petition as the\r\nground of our application.\r\n\r\nI should be exceedingly obliged for any remarks your experience\r\nmay suggest, and trust you will accept the cause which dictates my\r\nwriting as a sufficient apology for troubling you on the subject.\r\n\r\nI have had great pleasure in reading your able replies to Salmo\r\nSalar's letters. On the appearance of the first, I was strongly\r\nprompted to reply to it myself, but rejoiced to find him in much\r\nbetter hands.\r\n\r\nI remain, Sir,\r\nYours very truly,\r\nWILLIAM AYRTON.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nCLITHEROE, _4th February_, 1854.\r\n\r\nTO WM. AYRTON, ESQ.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I am favoured with your letter of yesterday, and shall\r\nbe glad to give you any information I may possess on the habits of\r\nSalmon, or the requirements of any act of Parliament necessary for\r\nthe preservation and increase of this valuable fish. Being a mill-\r\nowner, I have interests which are supposed to clash with those of\r\nfish preservers; but I hope to be able to show that all mill-\r\nowners are able to give a passage over their weirs at all times\r\nwhen the fish are inclined to run; that is, when there are freshes\r\nin the river. I say this the more confidently, as I believe the\r\nworks here are the largest in England for the power of the stream\r\nthey stand upon, and I find it necessary to employ 150 horse-power\r\nof steam. Yet I find from a careful register, which has been kept\r\nhere since the year 1838, that we are able, without interfering\r\nwith the efficiency of the water power, to give the fish a passage\r\nover the weir 181 days, or part of days, annually, and this at\r\ntimes when alone they are disposed to avail themselves of such a\r\npassage--that is in floods.\r\n\r\nThe suggestions that occur to me from time to time I will not fail\r\nto send you. At present the following seem to me to be essential,\r\nto give efficacy to any Act of Parliament framed for the purpose\r\nof preserving and increasing the breed of Salmon, for without some\r\nsuch provisions the gentlemen on the upper parts of rivers will\r\nhave no inducement to exert themselves in the matter.\r\n\r\nFirst.--No nets or other engines, except rod and line, should be\r\nused for taking fish from six o'clock at night to six o'clock in\r\nthe morning, and all fish should be allowed a free passage up the\r\nstream every night when this does not destroy or impair the\r\nefficacy of the water power.\r\n\r\nSecond.--No mill-owner nor his servants, nor any other person,\r\nshould be allowed to take fish at his weir, or within fifty yards\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nThird.--Conservators should be allowed to go into all wheel-races,\r\nwheel-houses and tail-goits, and also upon all lands on the banks\r\nof Salmon rivers, as well as inspect all cruives, weirs, &c.,\r\nwithout being deemed guilty of trespass.\r\n\r\nFourth.--All weirs kept solely for fishing purposes, cruives, &c.,\r\nshould be compelled to give a free passage to the fish every night\r\nfrom six o'clock to six o'clock in the morning; and any\r\nobstruction placed in the gap calculated to hinder or frighten the\r\nfish back, should be deemed breaches of the Act of Parliament and\r\nliable to a penalty.\r\n\r\nFifth.--All nets and other devices for catching Eels should be\r\nprohibited in April, May, and June.\r\n\r\nSixth.--Close time should be altered and extended, as well as made\r\nuniform, in all rivers.\r\n\r\nSeventh.--The sale and use of Salmon roe should be prohibited.\r\n\r\nEighth.--Justices should be enabled to assist the passage of fish\r\nover weirs by any contrivance which did not impair their stability\r\nnor the efficiency of the water power.\r\n\r\nNinth.--All cruives should be formed of vertical bars, and should\r\nhave the intervening spaces to measure not less than three inches.\r\n\r\nTenth.--No nets used in a Salmon river should measure in the mesh\r\nless than two inches and a half from knot to knot.\r\n\r\nEleventh.--Any person having no right of fishing found with a net\r\nin his possession or a Salmon out of season, should be guilty of\r\nmisdemeanour.\r\n\r\nTwelfth.--A ten shillings' licence for angling for Salmon.\r\n\r\nThe reasons for most of these suggestions will be obvious to you,\r\nbut there are some which may not be so; I will therefore give a\r\nshort comment on such.\r\n\r\nThird and fourth.--The conservators shall have the right to\r\ninspect all wheel-races, cruives, &c., to see they are properly\r\nregulated, and also to see that no contrivance is used to drive\r\nthe fish back. In the evidence given before the House of Commons\r\nin 1825, it was proved that the lessee of a fishery in Scotland\r\nused to place a crocodile painted red in the king's gap, which the\r\nlaw compelled him to give from Saturday night till Monday morning.\r\n\r\nFifth.--The prohibition to set Eel nets in April, May, and June is\r\nto prevent the destruction of Smolts when going down to the sea.\r\n\r\nSeventh.--Salmon are destroyed here when spawning chiefly for the\r\nsake of the roe. If a man were fined for selling it or having it\r\nin his possession, this inducement would be weakened.\r\n\r\nEleventh.--There is the same reason for seizing the net of the\r\nblack fisher that there is for seizing the snare of the poacher,\r\nand if the latter can be convicted for having hares or snares in\r\nhis possession, I do not see why the former should not for having\r\nnets and Salmon.\r\n\r\nA meeting of the gentlemen interested in the fisheries of the\r\nRibble and the Hodder will be held on Friday, the 17th instant,\r\nprevious to which time I should be glad of your criticism.\r\n\r\nI am, dear Sir,\r\nYours very truly,\r\nTHOMAS GARNETT.\r\n\r\nP.S.--It occurs to me since closing my letter that I have\r\nforgotten one important provision required in any new Act of\r\nParliament--namely, protection to the Smolts in their downward\r\nmigration. Here the pools are swept with small meshed trammel nets\r\nof all the fish that they contain.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nARTIFICIAL PROPAGATION OF FISH.\r\n\r\nCLITHEROE, _23rd April_, 1863.\r\n\r\nTo the Editors of the \"Leeds Mercury.\"\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN,--I am somewhat at a loss to understand the object of\r\nMr. Horsfall's letter on this subject which appears in the\r\n\"Mercury\" of to-day. If he means that fish hatched by this process\r\nare as much at the mercy of their natural enemies as they are in\r\ntheir natural spawning beds I differ from him entirely; but if he\r\nmeans that there is no good in breeding migratory fish like\r\nSalmon, when the obstacles to their return in the shape of stake\r\nnets, impassable weirs, and poisonous waters are so numerous as\r\nthey are at present in many rivers (the Wharfe and the Aire are\r\nexamples of both), I entirely agree with him. Let us consider both\r\nsuppositions, for the more this subject is ventilated the more\r\nlikely is good to arise from the discussion. I think Mr. Horsfall\r\nis entirely wrong in the first supposition, for the following\r\nreasons: By artificial propagation the young fish escape all\r\ndamage from floods, and particularly ice floods, which scoop out\r\nall the loose gravel from the spawning beds, which are frequently\r\nentirely carried away by these floods. They escape all danger from\r\ndrought, which in some rivers is almost as bad, there being now\r\nseveral mounds of dry gravel in my length of the Ribble which were\r\nspawning grounds last December. They escape being destroyed as ova\r\nby Trout, Eels, Bullheads, Loaches, the larva of aquatic insects,\r\nducks (wild and tame), water rats, and water shrews. The last are\r\nsaid to be destructive to the spawn; but this I do not vouch for,\r\nas these two last-mentioned animals have not come under my own\r\nobservation as devourers of spawn.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the 500 Salmon ova said to have been taken from the\r\nstomach of a Trout, Ramsbottom is the authority for it, only he\r\nsays there were nearer 1,000 than 500, and he took them from the\r\nmaw of a large lake Trout at Oughterard, when netting the spawning\r\nSalmon for his artificial propagation. When Ramsbottom was fish\r\nbreeding for Mr. Peel the year after he first went to Ireland for\r\nthat purpose, he went into the brooks at night with a light. He\r\nnever found a pair of spawning fish without also finding several\r\nwaiters on Providence in the shape of small Trout, which were\r\npicking up the ova that descended the streams towards them.\r\nSeveral of these he caught, and they were perfectly gorged with\r\nspawn.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the ducks, Ramsbottom is again my authority. He\r\nfound that a flock of tame ducks frequented the spawning beds at\r\nOughterard; he bought one for the purpose of ascertaining whether\r\nthey eat spawn or not, and he found its crop quite full of spawn.\r\nWith regard to the aquatic larvae of insects, Mr. Horsfall may\r\neasily satisfy himself that they destroy spawn if he will turn\r\nsome into an artificial spawning bed. One of my friends failed to\r\nhatch his Trout ova because he could not keep out the fresh-water\r\nshrimps.\r\n\r\nMr. Horsfall seems to think that nature would be sufficient to\r\ntake care of her own interests if man did not step in to aid her\r\nendeavours; but if he is a sportsman he no doubt has a game-\r\nkeeper, who not only preserves the ground from poachers, but traps\r\ncats and weasels, shoots hawks, magpies and carrion crows, breeds\r\ntame pheasants, and generally looks to the well being of the game\r\nwithout trusting to the efforts of unassisted nature.\r\n\r\nLet us take the second supposition, that there is no good in\r\nartificial propagation when the fish which are sent to the sea can\r\nnever come back again by reason of insurmountable obstacles. If\r\nMr. Horsfall means this he is quite right; there is no good in the\r\nupper proprietors of Salmon rivers becoming brood hens for the\r\nowners of fisheries at the mouths of rivers or the proprietors of\r\nimpassable weirs, who take all the fish which get to the foot of\r\nthese weirs. I quite agree with Mr. Horsfall that it is in most\r\ncases easy to build practicable fish passes, and at a slight\r\nexpense, if people were willing to do so; but I wish to show that\r\nnotwithstanding the boasted effects of the Act of 1861, the upper\r\nriparian proprietors have not a sufficient inducement to build\r\nfish passes, and will not do so unless the expense can be made\r\nvery moderate indeed.\r\n\r\nI will take the river Ribble to illustrate my meaning. As a\r\ngeneral rule we have no fresh run Salmon until May, and the upper\r\nproprietors are supposed to have a sufficient share of the fish\r\nthat ascend the stream if the owners of the fisheries in the\r\nestuary and the tidal part of the river cease to net from six\r\no'clock on the Saturday night to six o'clock on the Monday\r\nmorning. That is a day and a half per week. The fishing for Salmon\r\n(except angling) ceases on the 31st of August, and from the 1st of\r\nMay to the 31st of August there are 123 days. Call the period\r\neighteen weeks, which gives us twenty-seven days during which time\r\nthe Salmon have liberty to pass to the upper parts of the river.\r\nBut on the average of seasons, owing to droughts, the rapid\r\nabsorption of moisture by vegetation, and the great evaporation,\r\nthere is no fresh water to enable the fish to ascend during two-\r\nthirds of that time. Every one who knows anything of the habits of\r\nSalmon is aware that they never ascend the rivers from the estuary\r\nunless there is a fresh in the river; and, as I said before, on\r\nthe average of seasons there is no fresh for two-thirds of the\r\ntime from May to August. This reduces the twenty-seven days (which\r\nare supposed to feed the upper proprietors with Salmon to\r\nrepletion) to nine days, and these nine days are expected to stock\r\nthe river and its tributaries for one hundred miles. It is true I\r\nhave not taken into consideration the privileges which the upper\r\nproprietors have of angling to the 1st of November; but besides\r\nthe fact that the fish are then full of spawn, and ought not to be\r\nkilled at all, very few rise at the fly, and when they are taken\r\nthey can neither be sold nor used by any one who knows what a\r\nfresh Salmon is. It is a greater crime against public polity to\r\nkill a spawning Salmon than it is to steal a sheep; for, supposing\r\nit produces 10,000 ova, and one in a hundred returns as a Salmon,\r\nit returns from a place (the sea) where it has cost nothing in\r\nrent, taxes, or superintendence, and, in the finest condition\r\nimaginable, it invites us to take it.\r\n\r\nMr. Horsfall and I both wish for the same results (rivers swarming\r\nwith fish), and although we may somewhat differ as to details, I\r\nhave no doubt both would be glad to see public attention directed\r\nto these matters rather more than it is at present.\r\n\r\nIf Mr. Horsfall will do me the honour to come and see me, I will\r\nshow him an efficient fish-pass which has been in operation forty\r\nyears. It may suggest some ideas to him, and he may be able to\r\nsuggest some improvements in it which I should be glad to receive.\r\n\r\nI am, Gentlemen,\r\nYour obedient Servant,\r\nTHOMAS GARNETT.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nLOW MOOR, _4th January_, 1865.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--As I believe Mr. Eden, the Commissioner of Salmon\r\nfisheries, is visiting various districts connected with Salmon\r\nrivers in England and Wales, with a view of explaining the\r\nproposed alterations and additions to the bill of 1861, and as I\r\nthink from what I have learnt that the proposed alterations and\r\nadditions will not be satisfactory to the upper proprietors of\r\nSalmon rivers, I wish to call your attention to the matter, that,\r\nif he should come into this district, the gentlemen interested may\r\nbe able to point out to him how far these alterations are from\r\nmeeting their wishes. Supposing that the new bill (as published in\r\nthe \"Field\" newspaper, and explained and commented on by Mr. Eden)\r\nis to be understood as a government measure and one in which they\r\nwill allow of no alterations, I maintain that it is very\r\nobjectionable both from what it omits and what it purposes to do.\r\n\r\nTo begin with the former, or, in other words, to take the\r\nrecommendations of the Worcester meeting as the groundwork of new\r\nlegislation, it does not touch on several of them; they were, so\r\nfar as I remember (for I have no memoranda to refer to) an\r\nextension of the weekly and annual close time--minimum penalties:\r\n--a close time for Trout, and a right of way on the banks of\r\nSalmon rivers for all water-bailiffs, duly appointed, without\r\ntheir being deemed guilty of trespass; and a tax on fishery nets\r\nand implements, for the purpose of defraying the expenses of\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\nNow, so far as I understand the bill as proposed, the only one of\r\nthese recommendations included in it is the tax. I am wrong in\r\nthis--the taxation is not included in the bill, but was suggested\r\nby Mr. Eden at the meeting he attended lately at Chester. The bill\r\nproposes that the choice of conservators shall be vested in the\r\nmagistrates at quarter sessions, and the conservators shall have\r\npower to expend all the funds raised by voluntary subscriptions\r\nfor certain purposes mentioned in the act. But Mr. Eden suggested\r\nat Chester that if these funds were inadequate the conservators\r\nshould have the power of supplementing them by a rate on the\r\nowners and lessees of fisheries in proportion to their extent. Now\r\none man may have an estate on the banks of a river extending for\r\nmiles from which he derives little or no revenue; while another\r\nmay have a fishery not extending more yards than the other does\r\nmiles, but from which he derives a revenue of as many pounds as\r\nthe other does pence. If Mr. Eden's meaning is lineal extent, I\r\nfeel very sure it will not meet with the approval of the upper\r\nriparian proprietors. Again, why should the magistrates in quarter\r\nsessions (nine-tenths of whom know nothing of Salmon or Salmon\r\nrivers) choose the conservators? What, for instance, would the\r\nmagistrates meeting at Wakefield know of the Ribble or the Hodder?\r\nWhat would they care about the matter? They would choose the men\r\nwho had power to tax the riparian proprietors and lessees; but as\r\nthey would not be taxed themselves, they would look on with great\r\ncomposure. No; if we are to be taxed, let us tax ourselves, and\r\nnot leave it to those who will have no interest in the matter, and\r\nwho may involve us in litigation and expense over which we shall\r\nhave no control.\r\n\r\nThe recommendations of the Worcester committee deserved more\r\nconsideration on the part of Government. They were suggested by\r\nmen of great experience, and, moreover, unless they are adopted\r\nand legalized by Parliament there can be no permanent prosperity\r\nfor Salmon rivers. Take the extension of close time as an\r\ninstance. It cannot be right that the owners or lessees of estuary\r\nfisheries shall be allowed to take ninety per cent. of the fish\r\nwhich they have neither bred nor fed, and whose well-being and\r\nincrease they have done nothing to promote; while the upper\r\nproprietors, on whom devolve all the care, trouble, and expense,\r\nare to rest satisfied with what the thirty-six hours per week can\r\ngive them. What did they give the upper proprietors on the Ribble\r\nand the Hodder last season? Little or nothing. When the bill of\r\n1861 was before the House of Commons, I had an opportunity of\r\nsuggesting (indirectly) to the late Sir George Cornewall Lewis the\r\npropriety and desirableness of an extension of the weekly close\r\ntime for the benefit of the upper proprietors. He replied, \"You\r\nmight as well propose to restrict the shooting of partridges to\r\nthree days a week as to restrict the netting of Salmon.\" But with\r\nall due deference to so great an authority, there is no analogy\r\nbetween the two cases. If partridges had all to migrate and return\r\nbefore they could be legally shot, and had, like the Salmon, all\r\nto return by the same road, ninety per cent. of them before\r\nreaching the district where they were reared would become the prey\r\nof men who had neither bred nor fed them. I fancy sportsmen would\r\nwant protection for them; and if they were not able to obtain it,\r\nthey would do what is seriously proposed by many people with\r\nregard to the Salmon--they would do all they could to exterminate\r\nthem, rather than continue to act as brood hens to hatch chickens\r\nfor other men's eating.\r\n\r\nThen take the annual close time and the pretended compensation it\r\noffers in the two months' rod-fishing (September and October).\r\nAfter the nets have been withdrawn, what is it worth? Or, what is\r\nthe value of black fish full of spawn? They cannot be sold; they\r\nare not fit to eat; the spawn has nearly arrived at maturity, and\r\nthe only value the fish has is in the spawn, which is potted and\r\nsold in many instances by the poacher who kills the fish. He\r\ndeserves no other name, whatever may be his rank or station.\r\n\r\nAgain, in the 21st section, regulating the weekly close time, it\r\nis enacted \"That any person acting in contravention of this\r\nsection shall forfeit all the fish taken by him, and any net or\r\nmovable instrument used by him in taking the same, and, in\r\naddition thereto, shall incur a penalty of not exceeding five\r\npounds, and a further penalty of not exceeding one pound for each\r\nfish.\" But in the 17th section, which regulates the annual close\r\ntime, though there is a penalty for the contravention and\r\nforfeiture of the Salmon so taken, there is no forfeiture of nets\r\nand implements. You will no doubt remember how this worked when\r\nthe watchers took a net and boat, near Preston, last season, after\r\nthe setting in of the annual close time. How the owner of the net\r\nand boat came to claim them, on the pretence that the net had been\r\nstolen from the bank, where it had been left to dry, although his\r\nown men were the parties who were so illegally using them.\r\n\r\nMinimum penalties.--I see no mention of them in the new bill,\r\nalthough it is notorious that many magistrates have fined\r\nconvicted poachers in the penalty of a farthing or a shilling.\r\nWhat is this but an encouragement to do so again?\r\n\r\nClose time for Trout.--This is greatly needed in Salmon rivers, as\r\nit is well known that many a poacher pretends to be fishing for\r\nTrout when he is looking after Salmon. This is doubly needed when\r\nthe Salmon ascend the small tributaries to spawn.\r\n\r\nThe right of way for water bailiffs.--There is no clause or\r\nsection in the new bill giving the right of way on the banks of\r\nSalmon rivers to duly authorized persons without their being\r\ndeemed guilty of trespass. But there is one by which they are\r\npermitted to examine weirs. There is on my part no objection to\r\nthis examination, but why are millowners stigmatized by being\r\nsubjected to exceptional legislation? Are not the gamekeepers of\r\ngentlemen who have many miles of river subject to no surveillance\r\non the part of the water bailiffs as likely to act illegally as\r\nthe servants of the millowners? Let both be watched with equal\r\ncare, and I do not mind how vigilant the watching may be; but I do\r\nobject to being made the object of special and exceptional\r\nlegislation. The tax ought to be upon nets and rods and other\r\nimplements in proportion to their value. But if a tax is laid on\r\nthe extent of the fishery, we may bid adieu to voluntary\r\nsubscriptions.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, if Mr. Eden comes into this district, I think it\r\nought to be distinctly intimated to him that no bill would be\r\nsatisfactory to the upper proprietors which did not give them a\r\ngreater interest in the increase and improvement of rivers. There\r\nare three ways of doing this. The mesh of the Salmon net might be\r\nenlarged from eight to twelve inches round. This would allow\r\ngrilse to pass, and fill the river with breeding fish. Or,\r\nsecondly, the weekly close time might be extended so as to include\r\nFriday as well as Saturday afternoon and Sunday. Or, thirdly, the\r\nannual close time for net and rod fishing might commence a month\r\nearlier than at present; say net fishing to close on the 1st of\r\nAugust, and rod fishing on the 1st of October. Any of these\r\nmeasures would give the upper proprietors a much better supply of\r\nfish than they now have. They all, I think, deserve consideration.\r\nOne thing at least is certain, that unless the upper proprietors\r\nhave a better share of the fish than they have at present, they\r\nwill soon cease to take an interest in their preservation.\r\n\r\nTo Colonel J. Wilson Patten, M.P.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nLOW MOOR, _10th January_, 1865.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR,--I shall be very glad if I can induce you to read my\r\nopinions on the Salmon question. It is one which I think may\r\nbecome of even national importance, if properly managed. But the\r\nsad tinkering it has hitherto received in the nine hundred and\r\nninety-nine Acts of Parliament wholly or partly devoted to the\r\nsubject makes me almost hopeless about future legislation. Yet it\r\nseems to me that the only way to greatly increase the breed of\r\nSalmon is so simple and obvious, that its not having been adopted\r\nlong since can only be accounted for by supposing that all the\r\nparties interested in the matter are like the man in the fable,\r\nwho killed the goose that laid the golden eggs.\r\n\r\nHitherto the law has never properly recognized the claims of the\r\nupper riparian proprietors. These men have all the trouble and\r\nexpense of rearing and protecting the young fish, whilst the\r\nowners of estuary fisheries, men who never lift a hand nor spend a\r\npenny in taking care of the brood, take above ninety per cent. of\r\nthe grown Salmon when in season; and even then think they are\r\nhardly used. How can it be expected that the upper proprietors\r\nshould be very earnest in their protection of fish from which they\r\nderive little or no benefit, merely acting the part of brood hens\r\nand hatching the chickens for the benefit of other people?\r\n\r\nIn June, 1769, 3,384 Salmon and Salmon Trout were taken at a\r\nsingle haul of the net in the Ribble, near Penwortham. Now the sea\r\nis as wide, and, for anything we know to the contrary, as capable\r\nof feeding them as it was a hundred years ago; and the rivers are\r\nas capable of breeding and rearing them now as they were at that\r\ntime; and therefore I do not see why, if proper steps were taken,\r\nthey should not be as abundant now as they were then.\r\n\r\nIf we take a sheep or a bullock, and to his first cost add the\r\nrent of the land on which he has pastured, and something for\r\ninsurance and interest on capital, the transaction is not a very\r\nprofitable one in the long run. But in the case of the Salmon, we\r\nsend a little fish down to the sea which is not worth a penny, and\r\nhe remains there, paying neither rent nor taxes, neither\r\ngamekeepers' nor bailiffs' wages, costing nothing to anyone, until\r\nhe returns to the river, worth ten or twenty shillings, as the\r\ncase may be. Surely this is a branch of the public wealth that\r\ndeserves sedulous cultivation.\r\n\r\nI think with you that the Calder can never become a Salmon river,\r\nso long as manufactories flourish on its banks, and it is not\r\ndesirable that it ever should become so at their expense; but even\r\nin the Calder (and its tributaries) a little care would prevent\r\nimmense mischief. Some people at Church, a few years ago, very\r\ncarelessly pushed a quantity of poisonous matter into the Hyndburn\r\nbrook, and the first thunderstorm that followed carried it down\r\nthe Calder into the Ribble, and poisoned all the fish between\r\nCalder foot and Ribchester. Take another instance of carelessness\r\nin the Ribble, the emptying of the gas-holder tank at Settle,\r\nwhich when turned into the river killed nearly all the fish\r\nbetween that town and Mitton. Several other instances occur to me,\r\nbut these two are sufficient to show the great mischief occasioned\r\nby avoidable neglect and carelessness. Such mischief should not be\r\nperpetrated with impunity.\r\n\r\nThe act of 1861 was very good as far as it went, notwithstanding\r\nsome oversights; but it did not go far enough. It did not give to\r\nthe upper riparian proprietors such an interest in the fish as\r\nthey are entitled to, nor is the interest they now have sufficient\r\nto induce them to exert themselves in the preservation and\r\nincrease of the Salmon as they might and would do if such\r\nadditional stimulus were given to them. The law now is, that no\r\nnets shall be used in the taking of Salmon between twelve o'clock\r\nat noon on Saturdays, and six o'clock on Monday mornings. That is,\r\nforty-two hours per week. But in the Ribble, as a rule, we never\r\nsee seasonable Salmon until May. Now from that time to the 1st of\r\nSeptember, is, say sixteen weeks, and at forty-two hours per week\r\n(the length of the weekly close time) this gives twenty-eight days\r\nduring which time the fish may pass up the river without\r\ninterruption; but this is by no means the true state of the case.\r\nEveryone conversant with the habits of Salmon knows that they\r\nnever ascend rivers except when they are in a state of flood; and\r\nin average summers, partly owing to droughts, and partly to the\r\nrapid evaporation and absorption of moisture by vegetation, these\r\ntwenty-eight days may fairly be reduced by two-thirds, to give the\r\ntrue time allowed for the ascent of the fish. But say ten days,\r\nwhich are supposed to give an adequate supply of fish to a hundred\r\nmiles of river,--the extent of the Ribble and its Salmon-breeding\r\ntributaries. Is it surprising that the upper proprietors are not\r\nsatisfied with this state of things? It would be surprising if\r\nthey were content with such a cheeseparing allowance.\r\n\r\nWhen the bill of 1861 was before the House of Commons, I had an\r\nopportunity (indirectly) of suggesting to the late Sir George\r\nCornewall Lewis the propriety of a considerable extension of the\r\nweekly close time. He replied, \"You might as well propose to shoot\r\npartridges only three days a week, as to restrict the netting of\r\nSalmon to only three days.\" With all due deference to such an\r\nauthority, there is no analogy between the two cases. But if\r\npartridges had all to migrate and return before they could be\r\nlegally shot, and had, like Salmon, to come by one road, and if,\r\nlike them, ninety per cent. of them became the prey of men who had\r\nneither bred nor fed them, I fancy the sportsman who reared them\r\nwould want some restrictions placed on their being shot by men who\r\nhad not spent a farthing in breeding and protecting them, but who\r\ntook the lion's share in their appropriation.\r\n\r\nI saw Lord Derby on the subject last spring. He had, however, so\r\nlittle time at his disposal that he could only give me a few\r\nminutes. He said a good deal must be allowed for vested interests.\r\nI said, \"My Lord, I am a manufacturer. When the Ten Hours Bill was\r\npassed, manufacturers were deprived of one-sixth of their fixed\r\ncapital at a stroke, and had not a farthing allowed for their\r\nvested interests; nay, more, that measure involved the destruction\r\nof machinery which had cost millions. All this was done on grounds\r\nof public policy. And is not the Salmon question one of public\r\npolicy? If, as I suppose, the measure I advocate produced a great\r\nincrease in the breed of Salmon, the estuary fisheries would be\r\nthe first to profit by it. They are the first on the river.\r\nIndeed, the stake nets in the estuaries are taking fish daily in\r\ntimes of drought, when fish will not ascend the river at all.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1859 we had not a fresh in the river between the 10th of April\r\nand the 1st of August. And last year we had only a few days of\r\nflood between the beginning of May and the 31st August, when close\r\ntime (for nets) commences.\r\n\r\nI have said above that only ten days per year are allowed for the\r\nsupply of fish to the upper proprietors. I may be told that they\r\nhave two months (September and October) in which they are allowed\r\nto angle for them. True, but what are they worth? They are not\r\nallowed to be sold, they are not fit to eat, the fish are black\r\n(or red), the milt and spawn nearly at maturity, and the only\r\ntemptation they offer is to the poacher (who often pots the roe as\r\na bait for Trout); and he is a poacher, whatever his rank or\r\nstation, who will kill an October fish when full of spawn.\r\n\r\nLast year, at my suggestion, a meeting of gentlemen interested in\r\nSalmon fisheries was convened at Worcester, during the meeting\r\nthere of the Royal Agricultural Society, and a number of\r\nsuggestions were made, and resolutions were come to, which were\r\nintended to serve as a basis for the desired alterations in the\r\nSalmon Bill of 1861. I have no memoranda to which I can now refer,\r\nbut the most important, according to my recollection, were the\r\nfollowing:--The extension of the weekly close time; the annual\r\nclose time to be extended to Trout; a right to be given to all\r\nconservators and water-bailiffs, duly appointed, to pass along the\r\nbanks of Salmon rivers without being deemed guilty of trespass; a\r\ntax on fishing-nets, rods, and implements, to defray the expenses\r\nof protecting the rivers from poachers.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioner of Salmon Fisheries, Mr. Eden, has been convening\r\nmeetings of gentlemen interested in Salmon rivers at Chester,\r\nConway, York, and various other places, to explain the provisions\r\nof the bill which Government introduced at the end of last session\r\nand intend to bring forward again. I have not attended any of\r\nthese meetings, but expect he will be at Whalley or Preston\r\nshortly, when we shall hear what he has got to say. The new bill,\r\nas printed last year, does not embody any of the suggestions of\r\nthe Worcester meeting; but as I learn from private sources, Mr.\r\nEden, at the various meetings he has lately attended, has thrown\r\nout various suggestions, some of which are highly objectionable.\r\n\r\nFor instance, he suggests that the magistrates in quarter sessions\r\nassembled shall have the power to appoint conservators, and that\r\nthe conservators shall have the power to expend all the money\r\nraised by subscription in having water-bailiffs to put up fish-\r\nladders, commencing actions at law in certain cases; and if the\r\nsubscriptions are not adequate to defray all these expenses, that\r\nthey (the conservators) shall have the power to levy a rate in aid\r\non the riparian proprietors.\r\n\r\nI cannot see how this can be made to work equitably. If the rate\r\nbe laid on the extent of frontage to the river, one man may have a\r\ngreat extent of no value for fishing purposes, another may have\r\nonly one pool, so conveniently formed and placed for netting that\r\nhe will be able to catch ten times as many fish as the other. Then\r\nhow are the fisheries in the estuary and just above tideway to be\r\nvalued? They probably take ninety per cent. of all the seasonable\r\nfish. Will they be willing to pay ninety per cent. of the rate?\r\n\r\nAgain, the college at Stonyhurst claims a right of _several\r\nfishery_, both in the Ribble and the Hodder. That is, they\r\nexercise a right to fish in both rivers, where they have no land,\r\nand they exercise this right so freely that they take more fish\r\nthan all the other upper proprietors added together. If, then, the\r\ntax is laid on the extent of frontage to the rivers, these\r\nreverend gentlemen would escape entirely, so far as the right of\r\n_several fishery_ extends, and would only pay the rate on their\r\nown extent of frontage.\r\n\r\nAgain, the new bill does not embody the suggestions of the\r\nWorcester meeting as to the right of way for the water-bailiffs;\r\nbut according to Mr. Eden's comment upon it at Chester and\r\nelsewhere, a strict surveillance is to be kept on weirs, to which\r\nthe water-bailiffs are to have free access. Personally I have no\r\nobjection to this, provided the water-bailiffs are allowed free\r\naccess to the banks of the river elsewhere; but I have a strong\r\nobjection to be made the subject of offensive exceptional\r\nlegislation. Are not gamekeepers as likely to need looking after\r\nas mill-owners?\r\n\r\nAgain, the bill does not touch on minimum penalties. This it ought\r\nto do, for in some districts (Wales, for instance) there is a\r\nstrong animus against all attempts at preserving the Salmon, and\r\nnotorious poachers, duly convicted of offences against the act of\r\n1861, in some instances have been fined a shilling, in others a\r\nfarthing.\r\n\r\nTo W. H. Hornby, Esq., M.P.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nREMARKS ON A PROPOSED BILL FOR THE BETTER PRESERVATION OF SALMON.\r\n\r\nCLITHEROE, _August 27th_, 1860.\r\n\r\nHENRY GEORGE, ESQ.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I am favoured by the receipt of your letter of the 25th\r\ninst., and the accompanying draft of a proposed bill \"for the\r\nbetter Preservation of Salmon,\" and proceed at once to offer such\r\nremarks and suggestions as occur to me, and shall be glad to learn\r\nthat they meet with your approval.\r\n\r\nIn the third clause (section) you give an interpretation of the\r\nnames under which you wish to include all fish of the Salmon kind.\r\nDoes not this include common Trout? You specially include Char by\r\nname. Would it not be better to limit your intentions to all\r\nmigratory fish of the Salmon kind, to wit, Salmon, Grilse, &c.\r\n&c.? I think also the meaning of a fixed net wants defining more\r\nrigorously. As it now stands it appears to me that it would\r\ninclude any net which should be fastened on a root or stone whilst\r\nit was being drawn through a pool, if the men employed in doing\r\nthis were to let go the cords whilst they loosed the net from the\r\nobstruction.\r\n\r\nFourth clause.--I quite agree with you on the period allotted to\r\nannual close time, but think there ought to be a penalty for\r\nbuying, selling, or having in possession Salmon roe (save and\r\nexcept for the purpose of artificial propagation).\r\n\r\nSeventh.--I do not agree with you at all on the subject of the\r\nweekly close time, which in my opinion ought to be for one-half of\r\nevery day, except Sunday, and the whole of that day. Why should\r\nthe owners of fisheries at the mouths of rivers, who are at\r\nneither trouble nor expense in breeding or preserving the spawning\r\nfish, have all the benefit derivable from their increase? Why\r\nshould the upper proprietors act the part of brood hens for these,\r\nhatching and preserving the fish for the benefit of those who take\r\nno trouble about these things themselves?\r\n\r\nTwelfth.--I do not agree with you as to the size of the mesh: I do\r\nnot think that a mesh of twelve inches in circumference, or three\r\ninches from knot to knot, at all too large; it would permit fish\r\nbelow six pounds to escape, and this being done, there would under\r\nany circumstances be a fair supply of breeding fish.\r\n\r\nFifteenth.--I think your leister requires a more rigorous\r\ndefinition. A man in this neighbourhood is reputed to have killed\r\na good many Salmon with a hay or a dung fork. Are either of these\r\nleisters?\r\n\r\nYour sixteenth section is utterly impracticable. How could such\r\nhecks or grates be prevented from choking with leaves in the\r\nautumn and ice in the winter, thus stopping the wheels? You might\r\nas well require a farmer to hedge out the game. Impose a penalty,\r\nif you like, upon any millowner who may kill Salmon in his mill\r\nlead; and as you give your conservators power to inspect\r\neverywhere, you will readily detect such practices. But it will\r\nnever do to close the mills by pretexts that the fish may be taken\r\nor killed there.\r\n\r\nTwenty-first.--I do not understand the meaning of this. But taken\r\nin its ordinary sense, it seems to me to be very unjust. Many\r\npersons have traps in their weirs for the purpose of taking Salmon\r\nto which they plead a prescriptive right. Do you mean to do away\r\nwith these? You may succeed in this, but why should not a man be\r\nallowed to fish in the river above the weir where there are no\r\nobstructions to the passage of the fish? And why should not a man\r\nbe allowed to fish with a rod and line below the weir, and as near\r\nto it as he chooses? I think weirs might be safely divided into\r\ntwo classes: those used for manufacturing purposes and those for\r\nfishery purposes; that a man should be allowed to say in which\r\nclass his weir should be included. If for manufacturing purposes\r\nhe should not be allowed to catch Salmon (except with rod and\r\nline) within a certain distance below the weir. If he choose to\r\nclass his weir as one for fishery purposes, he should then be\r\ncompelled to give a free passage to the fish for twelve hours\r\nevery day; but he should be compelled to make his election as to\r\nthe class in which he would include his weir.\r\n\r\nTwenty-fifth.--It would never do to allow the commissioners to\r\nmake bye-laws. Suppose the case of a millowner who got into a\r\ndispute with them: he might be utterly ruined by their bye-laws;\r\nthey might make bye-laws which deprived him of his water-power,\r\nunder a pretext that they were taking more efficient care of the\r\nSalmon.\r\n\r\nThirty-first.--I think the licence to angle should be compulsory,\r\nand not at the discretion of the commissioner. That it should be\r\nin the nature of a game licence, qualifying and enabling the\r\nholder to angle in any river of Great Britain and Ireland,\r\nprovided he had the consent of the owner of the fishery where he\r\nwas angling.\r\n\r\n(_Additional observations_). Twelfth.--You say that no double net\r\nshall be used. Do you mean to prohibit the trammel, which is\r\nusually a treble and not a double net? You also prohibit one net\r\nbehind another, but you do not specify the distance outside of\r\nwhich a second net would be lawful. If neither a series of Scotch\r\nnets nor a single trammel is to be used, by what sort of net do\r\nyou propose to catch the Salmon?\r\n\r\nNineteenth.--You say the sluices which admit water to wheels or\r\nfactories shall be kept closed from six o'clock on Saturday night\r\nto six o'clock on Monday morning. How, then, are the repairs of\r\nshafting and machinery to be made? These are generally done when\r\nthe workpeople have gone home on Saturdays. Besides, what is your\r\nobject? If the river is low, the Salmon will not be running up the\r\nstream, and if it be in flood there will always be an abundant\r\nsupply running over the weir in addition to that which would be\r\nrequired to turn the wheel. You add that the water may be allowed\r\nto flow freely through the waste-gate, provided the opening of\r\nsuch a waste-gate shall not deprive the mill of the necessary\r\nsupply of water.\r\n\r\nEighteenth.--In this clause you say that in weirs already\r\nconstructed it shall be lawful for the commissioner, on the\r\napplication of any two or more persons interested in the fisheries\r\nof such river, and at the proper costs and charges of the persons\r\nmaking such application--proof having been first given, &c.--to\r\ncause a survey to be made of such dam or weir by a competent\r\nengineer, and to direct such alterations to be made therein as\r\nshall, in the opinion of the commissioner, be necessary and\r\ndesirable, &c.\r\n\r\nIn this clause, which so far as it goes is very desirable, you\r\nhave omitted a proviso without which it could never pass into a\r\nlaw. You have forgotten to provide for the legal right of the\r\nmillowner, which would, or might, be taken away by the alteration\r\nmade in the weir unless there were some provision in the act which\r\nprevented this being done. At present there is no such proviso in\r\nyour act. Here I have offered for years to allow the upper\r\nproprietors to make any alteration they liked in the weir,\r\nprovided such alterations did not affect the milling power, the\r\nstability of the weir, or my legal title to the weir as existing\r\nat present. And my legal adviser tells me that any alteration made\r\nin the weir without a guarantee from the upper proprietors would\r\nvery probably deprive me of my present title.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nLETTERS ON AGRICULTURAL SUBJECTS.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nON THE CULTIVATION OF WHEAT ON THE SAME LAND IN SUCCESSIVE YEARS.\r\n\r\n_To The Editor of the \"Manchester Guardian.\"_\r\n\r\nCLITHEROE, October 5th, 1843.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I PROMISED to send you some details of my attempt to grow\r\nwheat on the same soil year after year. These I now forward, and\r\nhope they may prove interesting. I was led into these experiments\r\nby reading Liebig's book on the \"Chemistry of Agriculture;\" for,\r\nassuming his theory to be true, it appeared to me to be quite\r\npossible to grow wheat on the same land year after year; as,\r\naccording to that theory, the carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen, which\r\nconstitute the great bulk of all cereal crops (both grain and\r\nstraw), are supplied in abundance from the soil and atmosphere (or\r\nperhaps, to speak more correctly, from the latter), and we have\r\nonly to supply those inorganic substances, which, however\r\nnumerous, form but a small part of the whole weight of the crop.\r\nWith the view of testing this theory, and hoping that I might be\r\nable to find out what were the elements which built up and\r\ncemented the carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen together--or, in other\r\nwords, which constituted fertility--I begun, in the autumn of\r\n1841, to experiment on a field which had been exhausted by a\r\nsuccession of crops, and which had just been cleared of one of\r\noats. I chose an exhausted field in preference to any other, as\r\nthe only one in which I could test the truth of the theory. It was\r\nvery foul, being full of couch grass and weeds of all kinds. It\r\nwas ploughed up and hastily picked over, for the season was so\r\nunfavourable for cleaning the land (from the great quantity of\r\nrain that fell) that I was almost induced to abandon the\r\nexperiment. Previously to sowing the seed, one-fourth of the field\r\nwas manured with a compost of night-soil and coal-ashes, at the\r\nrate of forty tons to the customary acre (7840 yards); the\r\nremaining three-fourths having the seed put in without any manure\r\nwhatever. The winter was very unfavourable for the plants in our\r\ncold wet soil, and in the unmanured part of the field many of them\r\nperished, and those that survived made very little progress, from\r\nhaving no stimulus at the roots. Thinking it desirable to apply my\r\nexperimental manures in moist weather, I waited until the 6th May,\r\nwhen I treated that part of the field which had _not_ been manured\r\n(three-fourths of the whole) in the following manner. I applied\r\nguano to one-fourth, at the rate of two hundredweight to the\r\nstatute acre, and the same weight of nitrate of soda over another\r\nfourth, leaving one-fourth entirely without manure. The wheat\r\nmanured with the guano and nitrate of soda grew vigorously, and\r\nthe ears, more particularly in the part manured with guano, were\r\nthe finest I had ever seen, but when it came to ripen it\r\nshrivelled in the ear, and the sample was very indifferent; the\r\nsoil being evidently deficient in some property necessary for\r\nperfecting the grain. The crop also suffered much from the\r\ndepredations of the birds.\r\n\r\nThe portion manured with night-soil produced\r\n     to the statute acre 32 bushels of 60 lbs. each.\r\n\r\nGuano            \"   \"   27      \"    \"    \"\r\nNitrate of Soda  \"   \"   27      \"    \"    \"\r\nUnmanured part   \"   \"   19 2/3  \"    \"    \"\r\n\r\nI give these details to show that the land was in an exhausted\r\nstate previous to the commencement of the experiment I am now\r\nabout to detail. After the crop of 1842 was reaped, the land was\r\nimmediately ploughed up, and the season being very favourable, it\r\nwas tolerably well cleaned, and the seed was sown (without any\r\nmanure) about the first week in October. After the wheat came up,\r\nit was manured with a dusting of one hundredweight of guano, over\r\nthe entire field (about one acre, three roods), to keep the plants\r\nalive through the winter. In the spring, being divided into three\r\nportions, it was manured with the same number of experimental\r\nmanures, which were furnished to me by Mr. Blyth, of Church, near\r\nAccrington, who also analyzed the soil and subsoil for me. These\r\nmanures were applied about the 10th of April, and the experiment\r\nwas still further varied by covering a portion of each division\r\nwith guano a fortnight afterwards, at the rate of two hundredweight\r\nto the acre, but all the manure applied to the crop, including the\r\nhundredweight of guano put on in the autumn, did not exceed 6 1/2\r\nhundredweight. The crop, which was a very thin one in the spring,\r\nimproved so much by the application of these manures, that when it\r\ncame into ear, it was allowed by all who saw it to be the best in\r\nthe neighbourhood; but the heavy rains of July caused it to lodge\r\nin the best part of the field, and there it was attacked by rust,\r\nand the sample was very indifferent. In addition to this drawback,\r\nthere being very little wheat grown in the neighbourhood of the\r\ntown, and this being much earlier than any of the other fields,\r\nwas attacked by the birds as soon as the grain was formed in the\r\near. Notwithstanding all the efforts made to prevent them, they\r\ncontinued feeding upon it until it was cut; and it is a very\r\nmoderate estimate of the damage, to say that they destroyed one-\r\nfourth of the crop throughout the field. That part of the field\r\ncovered with manure (No. 1) being the earliest, suffered most.\r\nThere were patches of several square yards where there did not\r\nappear to be a single grain left; and wherever the birds took a\r\ngrain from the middle of the ear, when in the milky state, the\r\ngrains on each side of it appeared to grow no more, but shrivelled\r\nup in the ear.\r\n\r\nI have little doubt that in this portion of the field one-third of\r\nthe crop was destroyed. All this seems to reduce the experiment to\r\nlittle more than guess-work; and it will, probably, be very\r\ndifficult to persuade those who did not see the field when it was\r\ncut, to credit this report of the devastation made by the birds;\r\neven when they are told that Clitheroe is a town of 7,000\r\ninhabitants, and probably as many sparrows, and that apparently\r\nthey were all assembled to feed in this field; and they became so\r\naccustomed to the good living they found there, that even when our\r\nneighbours' wheat was fit to eat, they continued to favour this\r\nfield with their visits in preference to going elsewhere. I\r\nestimate the damage on No. 1 at one-third, No. 2 at one-fourth,\r\nNo. 3 at one-fifth; this was later than the others, and suffered\r\nmore from rust than birds.\r\n\r\nThe following are the results:--From 3,060 yards manured with No.\r\n1, there were obtained 1,042 lbs. of wheat, or 27 1/2 bushels of\r\n60 lbs. each to the statute acre; if we add one-half to this, as\r\nwe assume that one-third was destroyed by the birds, it will give\r\n41 1/4 bushels to the statute acre. The weight of straw from this\r\nportion was 188 stones 5 lbs., 14 lbs. to the stone. From 2,856\r\nyards manured with No. 2, 962 lbs. of wheat were obtained, and 155\r\nstones 9 lbs. of straw; this is equal to 27 1/4 bushels per acre,\r\nor with one-third added, for estimated damage, it is equal to 36\r\nbushels per statute acre. From 2610 yards manured with No. 3,\r\nthere were 1,067 lbs. of wheat, and 211 stones 7 lbs. of straw, or\r\n33 bushels to the statute acre, to which if we add one-fourth,\r\naccording to the estimate of damage, it will be equal to 41 1/4\r\nbushels per acre. It will be observed that this portion yielded a\r\nfar greater weight of straw per acre than either of the others,\r\nand from the sort of manure applied, it was expected that this\r\nwould be the case.\r\n\r\nNo. 1 yielded straw at the rate of 297 3/4 stones per acre.\r\n \"  2    \"      \"     \"       \"    246 3/4      \"     \"\r\n \"  3    \"      \"     \"       \"    392 1/3      \"     \"\r\n\r\nMany people may feel inclined to say, that all these apparent data\r\nare mere guesses, and that a crop may be made into anything one\r\nlikes, if they assume so much for damages; but, fortunately, it is\r\nnot all guess-work. I have stated previously that I covered a part\r\nof each division with guano a fortnight after the application of\r\nthe manures in April, intending to see what advantage was obtained\r\nby the use of it; but, owing to the depredations of the birds, the\r\nportions of the first and second divisions manured with guano were\r\nnot kept separate from those which were left without guano; but\r\nthe third being later, and, therefore, not so much injured by\r\nthem, gave me an opportunity of ascertaining the effect. I\r\nmeasured off a land which had been so manured, and reaped and\r\nthrashed it out separately. From this land of 100 yards long and\r\n10 feet wide (3,000 square feet), there was obtained 220 lbs. of\r\nwheat, or 53 bushels of 60 lbs. per statute acre; and this was far\r\nfrom being the best portion of the field. I don't mean that it was\r\nnot the best portion of the crop, but I mean that the soil was not\r\nso good there as it was in other parts of the field; as I have\r\nbefore stated, in the best part of the field the crop was spoiled\r\nby being lodged by the rain, and subsequently attacked by rust.\r\n\r\nI communicate this to you, in the hope that the publication of it\r\nin your paper maybe the means of stimulating others to try the\r\nsame experiments. It is not too late yet to try for the next\r\nyear's crop, and I have no doubt that Mr. Blyth will be happy to\r\nsupply both material and information to any who may require them\r\nfrom him. It is the duty of everyone to promote the advancement of\r\nagriculture; and this is my contribution towards it. I have not\r\nyet done, for I have sown the same field with wheat again, and\r\nhope, with a favourable season, to reap a still more abundant crop\r\nnext year.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n_To the same._\r\n\r\nCLITHEROE, _October 12th_, 1844.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Last October you published an account of an attempt of mine\r\nto grow wheat on the same land year after year; and, as I have\r\nrepeated the experiment this year, I shall be obliged if you will\r\nbe kind enough to insert the account of it in the \"Guardian,\" as\r\nthe subject appears to me to be an important one; and, as many\r\npersons who may read this letter may either not have seen the\r\nformer, or may have forgotten it, I trust that a short summary of\r\nthe former experiments may not be out of place.\r\n\r\nThese experiments took place in the autumn of 1841, after the\r\nfield had been cleared of a crop of oats, which was a very bad\r\none; the land being not only naturally poor, but foul and\r\nexhausted by long cropping. As the season was very wet, it was\r\nindifferently cleaned, and one-fourth of it manured with a compost\r\nof night-soil and ashes, and then the field was sowed with wheat.\r\nTwo of the remaining three-fourths were manured on the 6th of May,\r\n1842 (the spring being a very dry one, no rain came until that\r\nday), one with guano, the other with nitrate of soda, each at the\r\nrate of two hundredweight to the statute acre, and the remaining\r\nfourth was left unmanured.\r\n\r\nThe following were the results at harvest:--That manured with\r\nnight-soil and ashes produced 32 bushels of 60 lbs. per acre;\r\nguano, 27 bushels; nitrate of soda, 27 bushels; unmanured, 19 2/3\r\nbushels. When the field had been cleared of the crop, it was\r\nimmediately ploughed up, and, as the season was favourable, the\r\nland was well cleaned and sowed with wheat in October, 1842,\r\nwithout any manure except 1 cwt. of guano, which was scattered\r\nover it when the wheat was coming up. The field was divided into\r\nthree portions, and in April, 1843, was manured as follows:--No.\r\n1, with 90 lbs. of sulphate of magnesia, and 2 cwt. nitrate of\r\nsoda to the statute acre; No. 2, with a compound from a\r\nmanufacturer of chemical manures; No. 3, with 60 lbs. of silicate\r\nof soda and 2 cwt. of nitrate of soda to the acre; and, with the\r\nview of still further varying the experiment, a part of each\r\nportion was sowed with guano a fortnight after the application of\r\nthe chemical manures. The crop promised to be a very good one, but\r\nit was much plundered by the birds, and as the summer was wet, it\r\nsuffered also much from rust. Allowing for the destruction\r\noccasioned by the birds, the crop was estimated at:\r\n\r\n41 1/4 bushels in patch No. 1,\r\n36       \"        \"     No. 2,\r\n41 1/4   \"        \"     No. 3,\r\n\r\nand in that part of No. 3 which was also covered with guano, it\r\nreached by actual weight (not by estimate), 53 bushels of 60 lbs.\r\nto the acre. Those patches in Nos. 1 and 2 which had guano put on\r\nthem, suffered so much from the depredations of the birds, that no\r\naccount was taken of them separately. The crop was cleared off the\r\nland, which was cleaned, and again sowed with wheat on 3rd\r\nOctober, 1843. It was drilled in rows seven inches apart, and at\r\nthe rate of 2 1/2 bushels to the acre. It is to the results of\r\nthis crop that I now wish to call your attention. Before sowing,\r\nthe land was subsoiled to the depth of from 14 to 16 inches;\r\nexcept a strip of about 10 feet in width, down the middle of the\r\nfield, which was left untouched for the purpose of determining\r\nwhat were the advantages derived from subsoiling. If the advantage\r\nwas merely that of thorough draining (for the field had not been\r\nthoroughly drained previous to the subsoiling), it was thought\r\nprobable that this strip of 10 feet wide would be drained by the\r\nsubsoiling on each side of it; but if, in addition to this, the\r\nwheat plant derived more nourishment by striking its root deeper\r\ninto the soil, where that was loosened by the subsoil plough, the\r\ncrop ought to be better in the subsoiled than in the unsubsoiled\r\npart. The field runs over the ridge of a hill, and upon that ridge\r\nthe soil is so poor and thin, that it was deemed expedient to give\r\nit a slight dressing of coal-ashes and night-soil, from an idea\r\nthat the plant would scarcely survive the winter unless some\r\nstimulus were applied there; but the ashes contained little\r\nmanure, and were only applied to the worst part of the field,\r\ncovering about one-third of its surface. The wheat was Spalding's\r\nProlific; it came up evenly and well all over the field. It was\r\nhand-sowed with lime early in February to the extent of about 24\r\ncwt. of dry lime on the acre. In order to ascertain  the value of\r\nlime, and the proper quantity, I had the field uniformly covered\r\nwith it, except one land, which was left entirely without, and the\r\nheadlands, which had one three, the other six times as much lime\r\nput upon them as any other part. The field was also dressed with a\r\nchemical manure of the following ingredients on the 16th March,\r\ncosting:--\r\n\r\n                                          L.      s.     d.\r\n\r\n1 1/4 cwt. nitrate of soda                0      17      6\r\n1      \"   impure sulphate of magnesia    0       5      0\r\n  3/4  \"   silicate of soda               0      11      3\r\n  3/4  \"   common salt                    0       2      0\r\n1 1/4  \"   gypsum                         0       2      0\r\nMixing and applying it, say               0       2      3\r\n\r\nTotal for statute acre                   L2       0      0\r\n\r\nSpeculating on the probability of a dry summer, I gave it an extra\r\nquantity of manure, and I think where guano is used afterwards, as\r\nit is by me, the nitrate of soda might be dispensed with, which\r\nwould bring the cost to L1 2s. 6d. per acre. I should prefer guano\r\nto nitrate of soda, because of the phosphates contained in the\r\nformer. At the distance we are from the sea (about thirty miles)\r\nit would seldom be necessary to apply common salt, as the gales of\r\nwinter generally bring as much as is needed; but last winter we\r\nhad no high winds, and I thought that where salt was applied with\r\nother chemical manures, the wheat was more luxuriant than where\r\nthere was none; but owing to a misunderstanding of the instructions\r\nto that effect, the produce was not kept separate. When the chemical\r\nmanure was applied, one land was left without, for the purpose of\r\ncomparison. Guano was sowed on the land on the 29th March, at the\r\nrate of something less than 2 cwt. to the statute acre, one side of\r\nthe field being covered with Peruvian, the other with African, and\r\nthe land on which no chemical manure had been sowed was half of it\r\ncovered with guano, and the other half left without anything except\r\nlime; but as it was thought desirable to ascertain the value of the\r\nchemical manure without guano, half of this patch was sowed with the\r\nchemical manure in April, after the long drought of the last spring\r\nhad set in. A small patch was left without manure, to show the\r\nnatural condition of the field, and to serve as a comparison with\r\nthe manured part alongside it, and also with the condition of the\r\nfield when the experiment commenced, 1841-2, when the unmanured\r\nportion yielded only 19 2/3 bushels to the acre. This part of the\r\nexperiment, however, was frustrated by the carelessness of the men\r\nwho thrashed out the wheat. The crop was a very good one throughout\r\nthe field, but was evidently shorter and thinner where there was\r\nno lime, and also where guano was applied alone. It was best on\r\nthe headlands where more lime had been applied. The weather was\r\nextremely favourable until the wheat was going out of bloom, but\r\nit then changed, and the crop was beaten down by the rain, in some\r\nplaces so thoroughly that it never rose again; and from that time\r\nto the day it was reaped (21st August), there were not more than\r\nsix fine warm days. This cold and ungenial weather would, no\r\ndoubt, materially affect both the quantity and quality of the\r\ncrop,--the sample only being just fair. On thrashing out the crop,\r\nI find the result to be as follows:--Where the guano and chemical\r\nmanure were applied, but no lime, the yield was 49 1/5 bushels of\r\n60 lbs. per statute acre; where the land was left unsubsoiled, it\r\nwas 52 1/2 bushels; when guano alone was applied, it was 42 1/3\r\nbushels; where the chemical manure alone was applied, it was 43\r\n1/2 bushels; where the African guano was applied, it was 45\r\nbushels; where the Peruvian was applied, it was 52 2/3 bushels; on\r\nthe headlands, where three times the quantity of lime (or 3 1/2\r\ntons per acre) was applied, it was nearly 62 bushels; and where\r\nsix times the quantity of lime (or 7 tons to the acre), it was 49\r\n2/3 bushels. I give this last result as it was ascertained, but do\r\nnot consider it conclusive, for the wheat plant on this headland\r\nlooked quite as well as the other, until it went out of bloom,\r\nwhen from some unknown cause it was partially blighted; an\r\nirregular patch from a foot to a yard in width and extending\r\nalmost from end to end of the headland becoming brown and parched,\r\nas if affected by lightning or some atmospheric visitation. With\r\nthe view of making these results a little clearer to the eye, I\r\nsubjoin the following tabular statement of the produce per acre in\r\nthe different parts of the field:--\r\n\r\nBushels of 60 lbs. per statute acre.\r\n\r\nGuano alone                                   42 1/3\r\nChemical manure alone                         43 1/2\r\nGuano and chemical manure, with 24 cwt.\r\nlime to the acre, but land unsubsoiled        52 2/3\r\nGuano and chemical manure, but no lime        49 1/5\r\nAfrican guano and lime                        45\r\nPeruvian  \"      \"                            52 2/3\r\n\"    \"   and 3 times as much lime             62\r\n\"    \"   and 6     \"         \"                49 2/3\r\nAverage crop throughout the field             50\r\n\r\nIt may be as well to observe, that the total expense of manure,\r\nand of its application to that portion of the field which produced\r\nsixty-two bushels per acre (including the guano and the additional\r\nquantity of lime used), was at the rate of 81s. per statute acre.\r\nDeducting the cost of the nitrate of soda, the utility of which,\r\nunder the circumstances, I am inclined to doubt, it would have\r\nbeen 63s. 6d. I consider these to be very favourable results, and\r\nas offering strong inducements to continue the experiment. I have\r\naccordingly had the land ploughed up and cleaned; and it was again\r\nsowed with wheat on the 9th inst. Having detailed the general\r\nresults of the experiment, I beg to offer the following remarks\r\nupon some points in it, which seem to me to require a little\r\nelucidation. I consider the success of this experiment to be in a\r\ngreat measure owing to the use of soluble silica and magnesia;\r\nbecause, although there is an abundance of silica in the soil, my\r\nfirst crop showed very miserable results, the grain being ill-fed\r\nand poor, and the straw soft and discoloured, although the year\r\n1842 was, in this district, very favourable for wheat, the month\r\nof August being singularly fine and warm; but when I combined the\r\nnitrate of soda with sulphate of magnesia, as in experiment No. 1\r\nin 1843, but still more so when I combined it with the silicate of\r\nsoda, as in No. 3 of that year, the straw became as strong, firm,\r\nand bright as need be desired; and this year when both these salts\r\nare combined with nitrate of soda, common salt, and gypsum, I have\r\nnot only good and bright straw, but also an abundant crop of wheat.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the lime used, it may be as well to state that the\r\nfield had not been limed for many years, and although in a\r\nlimestone district, showed a deficiency of lime on analysis. The\r\nsoil is a strong loam, on a brick clay subsoil, in which there is\r\nlittle or no lime, although the stony clays, which form the\r\nsubsoil in a great part of the district, abound in it, containing\r\nfrom twenty to thirty per cent. of carbonate of lime. I had always\r\nbelieved that lime was used in great excess in this neighbourhood,\r\nand had, in fact, an idea that its good qualities were overrated,\r\ninasmuch as it does not enter into the composition of the plant,\r\nexcept in very minute proportion; but last winter I saw a paper\r\n(by Mr. Briggs of Overton) on the possibility of growing wheat on\r\nthe same land year after year, in which the utility of lime in\r\npreventing rust was incidentally touched upon. I also saw Liebig's\r\nletters explaining the action of quicklime in liberating potash\r\nfrom the clay; and then I considered it very important to\r\nascertain the proper quantity to be applied. The quantity required\r\nto decompose the phosphate of iron was not great, and assuming\r\nLiebig's theory of its action in liberating the potash to be true,\r\nit seemed to me that an excess of lime would permanently\r\nimpoverish the land; for, supposing that the crop required 100\r\nlbs. of potash, and as much lime was applied as liberated 500\r\nlbs., what became of the 400 lbs. which did not enter into the\r\ncomposition of the plant? was not a large portion of this 400 lbs.\r\nwashed down the drains by the rain, and so lost for ever? Perhaps\r\nthe absence of lime in this field accounts for its beneficial\r\naction in the experiment just detailed; but if my supposition is\r\ncorrect, that any excess of potash which may be liberated from the\r\nclay by the use of quicklime (that is, any more than may be\r\nrequired to perfect the crop), is washed down the drains, and thus\r\nthe land is permanently impoverished by the excessive use of lime,\r\nit behoves landed proprietors to ascertain what is required, and\r\nthey should take care to apply no more than is necessary. This\r\ncaution is most particularly needed in this neighbourhood, where\r\nlime is cheap, and where the opinion is prevalent that the more\r\nthere is applied the better it is for the land, and where it is\r\ncommon to apply ten or twelve tons to the acre. I have stated\r\nabove that chemical manure was applied to a small portion of the\r\nfield after the setting-in of the drought in April. The action of\r\nthis manure showed that a good thing may be very injurious if\r\napplied at an improper time; for, although it produced a\r\nstimulating effect on the plant immediately after its application,\r\nthere was too little moisture in the land to dissolve it\r\nthoroughly, and thus enable the plants to appropriate it, until\r\nthe rain came, about the end of June, when the wheat had been in\r\nflower some time; but the stimulus was then so great that all the\r\nplants threw up fresh stalks (from the roots), which were in\r\nflower when the wheat was cut, and it was then found that they had\r\nnot only impoverished the plants, but had prevented the grain from\r\nripening. This was the case not only in the experimental field,\r\nbut in several others also, where the chemical manure was sowed\r\nafter the setting-in of the drought. When the field was sowed with\r\nguano, it was thought desirable to cover one part of it with the\r\nAfrican, and the other with Peruvian, for the sake of comparison;\r\nbut as the African did not appear to produce the same stimulating\r\neffect as the other, fifty per cent. more was applied, that the\r\ncost might be equal (the Peruvian cost 10s., the African 7s. per\r\ncwt.); but as the latter application of the African was made when\r\nthe wheat was just shooting into ear, the same objection applies\r\nto the experiment which does to the chemical manure applied after\r\nthe drought had set in--viz., that there was not sufficient\r\nmoisture in the soil to dissolve it thoroughly until the plant was\r\ntoo far advanced to benefit by it; and therefore its failure would\r\nbe no proof of the value of the African as compared with the\r\nPeruvian, which was the object of the experiment. It is true, no\r\nbad effects followed the application similar to those produced by\r\nthe misapplication of the chemical manure in dry weather, yet if\r\nsoluble salts like the latter did not find sufficient moisture in\r\nthe ground when applied in April, there is reason to suppose that\r\nthe former would not do so when applied in May. I regret the\r\nfailure of the experiment without any manure, as I think the\r\nresult would have shown satisfactorily that the land is so far\r\nfrom being impoverished by this system of cropping, that it is\r\nimproving every year. I think, however, that this is shown by the\r\nproduce of the land manured with guano alone. In the first year's\r\nexperiment the produce from guano alone was 27 bushels per acre,\r\nand both straw and wheat were very indifferent in quality. This\r\nyear the produce from guano alone is 42 1/3 bushels; and although\r\nneither straw nor wheat are so good as upon the adjoining lands,\r\nthey are both very much better than they were in 1842. It will be\r\nobserved that the result from the unsubsoiled portion is very\r\ngood, and if nothing more were said about it, people would be led\r\nto conclude that there was no advantage in subsoiling. But this,\r\nin my opinion, would be a great mistake; for to say nothing of the\r\nadvantage which the unsubsoiled portion would derive from the\r\ndrainage which it received from the subsoiling on each side of it,\r\nI found, when the field was ploughed up this autumn, that whilst\r\nthe unsubsoiled portion was stiff and heavy, the subsoiled part\r\nwas comparatively friable and loose, like a garden, and will, I\r\nexpect, show its superiority in the succeeding crops. It must be\r\nborne in mind, in reading these experiments, that we have here one\r\nof the most unfavourable climates in the kingdom for growing\r\nwheat, from the excessive quantity of rain that falls, three times\r\nmore rain falling annually in the north of Lancashire than at\r\nYork, and this, no doubt, is very prejudicial to the success of\r\nsuch a series of experiments as I have been detailing. It has been\r\nobjected to these experiments, that allowing all to have been done\r\nwhich is here detailed, it leads to no important conclusion; for\r\nalthough it may be practicable to grow wheat every year, in a\r\nsmall field like the one experimented on, it is not so on a large\r\nscale. But the objectors should remember that there is not the\r\nseed of a single weed sowed with the manure; and therefore if the\r\nland is thoroughly cleaned, and kept so, by hoeing the crop in the\r\nspring, it will require very little labour to fit it for another.\r\nBut I shall be better able to speak on this head next harvest,\r\nhaving sowed wheat on an oat stubble with once ploughing. It is\r\nsaid there are no weeds in Chinese husbandry, and if they can\r\neradicate them completely, so may we, if we adopt the same methods\r\nand follow them up as perseveringly. Again, admitting that it is\r\nnot practicable to grow wheat on the same land year after year on\r\na large scale, yet if we can double the crop in those years in\r\nwhich we do grow it, by the application of chemical manures (and\r\nthe same manures are applicable to all cereal crops), will not\r\nthat be a conclusion worth arriving at? That it is possible to do\r\nso, is, I think, sufficiently shown by the results I have\r\nobtained. What, then, may we expect when these experiments are\r\ninfinitely multiplied and varied, under the superintendence of\r\nskilful and experienced men, who will devote their whole time and\r\nattention to the subject? Will raising the average produce from\r\ntwenty-five to fifty bushels per acre be the utmost limit to which\r\nimprovement can be carried? I believe not. In conclusion, I would\r\nurge on all owners and occupiers of land, the importance of\r\ndevoting at least a small field to agricultural experiments, as I\r\nthink there can be no doubt that, if these are carefully and\r\nsystematically made and followed up by agriculturists generally,\r\nwe shall be so far from needing an importation of corn in average\r\nyears that we shall have a large surplus to spare for our\r\nneighbours.\r\n\r\nNOTE.--In the use of silicates of soda and potash one precaution\r\nis very necessary--viz., that you really have a soluble silicate,\r\nand not a mere mechanical mixture of ground flint and soda: this\r\nis a very different thing, and one, if it be not carefully guarded\r\nagainst, which will lead to nothing but disappointment. Again, the\r\nsilicate may be properly made in the first place, but in a long\r\nexposure to the atmosphere the soda attracts carbonic acid, and\r\nthe soda is liberated, and this has defeated my expectations more\r\nthan once. Again, though I consider it desirable to defer the\r\napplication of it until vegetation has fairly started in the\r\nspring, yet, in one instance, I delayed the application of it so\r\nlong, that there was not moisture to dissolve it until the end of\r\nJune, and then the wheat began to shoot afresh from the roots and\r\nthe crop was seriously injured by it: but this was in an\r\nexceedingly dry spring, and might not happen again for many years.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n_To the same._\r\n\r\nLOW MOOR, _18th December_, 1845.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I promised to communicate to you the results of my attempt\r\nto grow wheat on the same land year after year, this being the\r\nfourth crop of wheat (the fifth white crop) grown in successive\r\nyears on the same soil, and though I consider the crop an\r\nindifferent one, I don't think the failure ought in any degree to\r\nbe attributed to the over-cropping, but to the wetness and\r\ncoldness of the season, as well as other untoward circumstances\r\nhereafter to be mentioned.\r\n\r\nIn a former letter of mine of the 12th October, 1844--which was\r\npublished in the \"Guardian\" a few days after--I gave an account of\r\nthe crop of 1844, which was a very good one, being fifty bushels\r\nto the acre throughout the field, and as much as fifty-two bushels\r\nin the best part of it. This I considered so satisfactory that I\r\nhad the field again ploughed up and sowed with wheat on the 9th\r\nOctober, 1844, and it is to the results of this crop that I wish\r\nto call your attention. As remarked in my former letter, the field\r\nwas subsoil ploughed in the autumn of 1843, and this subsoiling\r\nwas carried to such a depth that most of the drains in the field\r\nwere more or less injured by it; and although this did no injury\r\nto the crop of 1844, owing to the very dry season, yet when the\r\nrain came in the winter of 1844, the want of drainage was found to\r\nbe very prejudicial, and in the wet places large patches of the\r\nyoung wheat went off altogether, and there was a great deficiency\r\nof roots in many parts of the field; the long continuance of frost\r\nand after that the ungenial weather which continued so long in the\r\nspring (of 1845) were also unfavourable, yet with all these\r\ndrawbacks the appearance of the plant after the growing weather\r\n_did_ come, was very promising, and many of my friends predicted\r\nthat I should have as good a crop as in 1844. On the 24th March I\r\napplied chemical manure of the same kind as I had done in 1844, at\r\nthe rate of about 3 1/4 cwt. to the acre (costing 23s. 6d.), and a\r\nfortnight after I had it sowed with 2 cwt. of guano to the acre.\r\nWhen the warm weather came, these manurings seemed to help it\r\nwonderfully, and it was, as I have before stated, a very promising\r\ncrop; but the cold, ungenial weather we had through a great part\r\nof the summer, and the continued rain we had whilst the wheat was\r\nin flower, destroyed all the former promise: and the manuring with\r\nguano, so far from being beneficial, was very injurious--so much\r\nso, that I believe every shilling's-worth of it applied to my\r\nwheat this year, made the crop a shilling worse than if nothing\r\nhad been applied; and all ammoniacal manures had the same effect.\r\nIt may be asked how I know it was the guano, and not the chemical\r\nmanure. In answer to this inquiry, if made, I may observe, that I\r\nsupplied two of my neighbours with the chemical manure, and they\r\napplied it without guano on very poor land, and they both assert\r\nthey had never such good crops of wheat before; but everywhere in\r\nthis neighbourhood, the only good samples of wheat that I saw or\r\nheard of were grown on exhausted soil. This appears to me to be a\r\nstrong proof that chemistry has a great deal to learn before it\r\ncan adapt its measures to all varieties of seasons, particularly\r\nas it cannot know beforehand how the season may turn out. If\r\nfurther proof be required of the injurious effect upon grain crops\r\nof ammoniacal manures in general, and of guano in particular, I\r\nmay mention that in another field of wheat, sowed on the 21st\r\nDecember, and which did not come up until the frost broke, in\r\nMarch (the previous crop having been Swedes), the blade was so\r\nyellow and the plant altogether so small and sickly in appearance,\r\nthat I had it manured with a water-cart from a cesspool in April.\r\nThis appeared to produce a wonderful improvement immediately, as\r\nthe plant assumed a deep green and grew very fast, but when it\r\nought to have shot, the heads seemed to stick in the sockets, the\r\nblade and straw became mildewed and made no progress in ripening.\r\nIt was not fit to cut for three weeks after the experimental\r\nfield, although it was an early white wheat, and the result was a\r\nmiserable crop--far worse than the experimental field. The\r\ninstance of injury from the use of guano, I had from a neighbour,\r\nwho told me he had sowed a patch of oats with it, and that they\r\nnever ripened at all, and that he was compelled to cut them green\r\nas fodder for his cattle. I had a striking proof this season of\r\nthe much lower temperature required by oats than wheat, when\r\nstrongly stimulated by manuring. I had gathered an ear of wheat\r\nand a panicle of oats the previous season, which seemed to me to\r\nbe superior varieties; and that they might have every chance, I\r\ndibbled them alongside each other in my garden, and determined to\r\nmanure them with every kind of manure I could procure, as I had an\r\nidea that it was not easy to over-manure grain crops, if all the\r\nelements entering into the composition of the plant were applied\r\nin due proportion to each other, and I also wished to ascertain\r\nwhether wheat and oats would thrive equally well with the same\r\nsort of manuring. I accordingly limed the land soon after the\r\nwheat came up, and in March I applied silicate of soda, sulphate\r\nof magnesia, gypsum, common salt, and nitrate of soda. A fortnight\r\nafter this I applied guano, then bones dissolved in sulphuric\r\nacid, then woollen rags dissolved in potash (the two latter in\r\nweak solution); and the consequence was, that I don't think there\r\nwas a single grain in the whole parcel--at least I could not find\r\none--the straw was no great length, and the blade much discolored\r\nwith mildew, whilst the oats were seven feet high, and with straws\r\nthrough which I could blow a  pea, and large panicles, although\r\nthe oat was not particularly well-fed. The inference I have drawn\r\nfrom these experiments is, that as far as is practicable the\r\nmanuring should be adapted to the temperature, but as this is\r\nobviously impossible in a climate like ours, the only way is to\r\nrather under than over manure, and to apply no ammoniacal manure\r\nto the wheat crop, or at all events very little; for although\r\nguano was beneficial to wheat when used in conjunction with\r\nsilicates, &c. &c. in 1844, yet the injury it did in 1845 may very\r\nfairly be set against that benefit. I should feel obliged if any\r\nof your readers who may have tried the experiment of manuring\r\ngrain crops with guano, the last season (1845) would publish the\r\nresult as compared with a similar crop without such manuring. I\r\nfeel convinced that such result would be against the use of guano\r\nfor wheat in 1845. I am the more confirmed in the opinion that\r\nammoniacal manures are unfavourable for wheat, by a series of\r\narticles in the \"Gardener's Chronicle\" on the \"Geo-Agriculture of\r\nMiddlesex,\" in which the writer states that land in that county\r\nwhich in Queen Elizabeth's time produced such good wheat that it\r\nwas reserved for her especial use, will now scarcely grow wheat at\r\nall, and when that grain is sowed upon it, the straw is always\r\nmildewed, and the sample very poor; and this is attributed--and no\r\ndoubt justly so--to the extensive use of London manure. My crop\r\nwas only 32 bushels to the acre of 60 lbs. to the bushel; last\r\nyear the crop, as I have said before, was 50 bushels of the same\r\nweight.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n_To the same._\r\n\r\nCLITHEROE, _7th March_, 1848.\r\n\r\nOn continuing my attempts to grow wheat on the same land year\r\nafter year, I observed that the crop of 1845 was very seriously\r\ninjured by the deficient drainage--the old drains having been\r\ndestroyed by the subsoil plough. It was therefore necessary to\r\nreplace them: they were accordingly put in four feet deep. This\r\noccupied so much time that the season for sowing wheat had gone\r\nby, and the ground was cropped with potatoes, which were got up in\r\nSeptember, and the wheat might have been got in early in October.\r\nBut seeing in your paper that sowing too early was not advisable,\r\nand also being carried away by the arguments of the thin-seeders,\r\nI deferred sowing until the middle of November, and then put in\r\nlittle seed; and the winter proving very unfavourable, when the\r\nwheat was coming up, there was not half plant enough in the\r\nspring, and I hesitated whether to plough up the ground or drill\r\nin barley. I determined to do the latter, which was done on the\r\n18th April, and wheat and barley grew up together, and when cut\r\nand threshed, proved to be equal to 48 bushels to the acre.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nLOW MOOR, _31st December_, 1844.\r\n\r\nHENRY BRIGGS, ESQ.\r\n\r\nI duly received your obliging letter in reply to my pamphlet on\r\nthe growth of wheat year after year on the same land, and now\r\noffer my rejoinder to your remarks. You seem to consider the\r\nexpense is too great under the system pursued by me; and that it\r\nwas more than was required by the crop, is proved in my opinion by\r\nthe fact that the fertility of the land is very much augmented\r\nsince the commencement of the experiment in 1841: as my first crop\r\nwith guano alone produced only 27 bushels per acre, whilst this\r\nyear from guano alone the produce was 42 bushels. But still I\r\nthink that your allowance of manure is far too little, and not\r\nexactly what I should apply, and I shall frankly state my\r\nobjections and opinions, in the hope that they may elicit a reply\r\nfrom you, as it will be from discussion and the experiments\r\ninstituted to test the various theories propounded, that\r\nagriculture will be most materially benefited. You state that\r\nLiebig's present theory is, that plants obtain the necessary\r\noxygen, hydrogen, carbon, and nitrogen from the rain and\r\natmosphere, and that the plants merely require the supply of\r\ninorganic constituents, and that you are inclined to agree with\r\nhim. My copy of his work on the Chemistry of Agriculture is his\r\nfirst edition; and I don't know how far he has since modified or\r\naltered the opinions therein expressed, which are in some degree\r\nat variance with each other. He states that it may be received as\r\nan axiom in agricultural chemistry that the nitrogen of the\r\natmosphere is never assimilated by plants, except in the form of\r\nammonia or nitric acid. He certainly states that plants and\r\nanimals derive their nitrogen from the atmosphere; but why, if\r\nthis be true, does he attach so much importance to the excrements\r\n(particularly urine), of men and animals being husbanded with so\r\nmuch care? and he states that for every pound of urine wasted, a\r\npound of wheat is thrown away. But even if he said it was utterly\r\nworthless, every practical farmer who has tried it knows how\r\nexceedingly valuable it is. It may be said there are other\r\ningredients in urine besides ammonia, and these are what make it\r\nvaluable; and in reply to this I would ask what is it that makes\r\nthe ammoniacal liquor from gasworks so valuable? There are no\r\nphosphates or alkalies there, and yet what a powerful stimulant it\r\nis. Again, Liebig states that the carbon is derived from the\r\natmosphere; but to say nothing of the argument which might be\r\ndeduced from the advantage which is derived by plants from having\r\ntheir soil loosened about their roots, the experiments of Dumas\r\nand Boussingault prove that a tree which was cut off below the\r\nbranches expired a large quantity of carbonic acid. It may be\r\nasked how I know this was not precipitated by the rain. I don't\r\nknow; but if the plant would assimilate this, why should it not\r\nassimilate that which arises from the decomposition of the\r\ncarbonaceous matter in the soil? My idea is that it does both, and\r\nthat carbon in the soil does good if it offers an abundant supply\r\nof carbonic acid to the plant when it is in a condition to\r\nappropriate it. Your allowance of lime appears to  me to be far\r\ntoo small, for if any reliance can be placed on my experiments,\r\nlime can be profitably used to far  greater extent than you seem\r\nto imagine. And, again, you seem to think that where there is\r\nplenty of silex in the soil, the plant will be able to obtain as\r\nmuch as it requires. I think that it is quite necessary that the\r\nsilex should be  in a soluble state, as I think that it is not\r\nonly desirable that all the elements necessary to fertility should\r\nbe in the soil, but that they should be in such a form that they\r\ncan be assimilated by the plant. Some of our compounds for\r\nproducing fertility may perhaps be as absurd as it would be to\r\ngive muriatic acid to a man troubled with indigestion, because\r\nfree muriatic acid is found in the stomach of a healthy person.\r\nLet me recommend you to try both silex and magnesia in a soluble\r\nstate, and I think you will be satisfied with the benefit derived\r\nfrom their use.\r\n\r\nRecurring again to the quantity of manure necessary to grow\r\nthirty-six bushels of wheat, I would ask, why limit yourself to so\r\nsmall a crop? The difference in the cost of your manuring a field,\r\nand my manuring it, is more than made up by the increase of\r\nfourteen bushels of wheat and the corresponding increase of straw,\r\neven if the land did not improve every year by the application;\r\nand as the seed, rent, labour, and liabilities of the land are the\r\nsame whether you grow a small crop or a large one, why not have it\r\nas large as possible? Again, if I applied far more manure than was\r\nnecessary, I ought to have had the crop equally good throughout\r\nthe field; but on the ridge of the hill, where the soil was thin\r\nand poor, neither straw nor wheat were so good as they were where\r\nit was deeper and richer. My own opinion is, that the plant is\r\nnever able to extract from the soil all the manure, and therefore\r\nit ought to be brought up to a good standard before good crops can\r\nbe expected. I am not satisfied with any analogy that I can think\r\nof, but the best that occurs to me is that of a cloth in a dye-\r\ncopper. You can never get it to absorb either all or half the\r\ncolouring matter, and if you don't use far more than is taken up\r\nby the cloth, you will never obtain the desired results. Besides,\r\nin chemical combinations it is desirable to use far more than the\r\nchemical equivalents, or the experiments don't succeed. I perceive\r\nthat you intend to use guano next year, and that you intend to use\r\nit along with the seed. I trust it will not be sowed in contact\r\nwith either the seed or the quicklime, which you proposed to use\r\nin some of your land. The best time I have found for applying\r\nguano is in wet weather, just when vegetation is making a start in\r\nthe spring--say the last week in March, or the first week in\r\nApril--as I fear a large part of the soluble portion of it would\r\nbe washed away by the rains of winter. It is true we have had none\r\nthis winter, but when shall we have such another? Did you ever use\r\nwoollen rags as manure? They ought to be excellent, as they are\r\nalmost all albumen, and are, I fancy, to be had at a very moderate\r\nprice, not far from you. Can you inform me what it is that causes\r\nthe land to be clover-sick? If it is the abstraction of something\r\nfrom the soil, what is that something? Sir Humphrey Davy said that\r\na dressing of gypsum would prevent it; but clover does not succeed\r\nhere (even when dressed with gypsum), if sowed every four years.\r\nOne reason why I think so small a quantity of manure will not\r\nsucceed, is based on the theory of excrementitious secretion.\r\nDecandolle proved that this secretion took place, but he did not\r\nsucceed in proving that it poisoned the land for a similar crop. I\r\ncan only reason from analogy, and it does not follow that an\r\nanalogy drawn from animal life will hold good when applied to\r\nplants; but if we were to feed an animal with pure gluten and pure\r\nstarch, with the proper quantity of phosphates, &c., are we to\r\nsuppose it would have no excrements? Let this be applied to\r\nplants: are we to suppose that the plant assimilates all that is\r\nabsorbed by its roots and leaves? When that which is absorbed is\r\nwhat would enter into the composition of the plant, is it not more\r\nrational to suppose that the inorganic and gaseous constituents\r\nonly combine in fixed proportions, and that although the plant may\r\nabsorb a much larger proportion of one than is required, the\r\nsurplus is discharged excrementitiously, and perhaps may be\r\nunfitted for entering into the plant until it has undergone a\r\ndecomposition? In conclusion, I trust you will pardon my frankness\r\nin so boldly canvassing your opinions; but it is in this collision\r\nof opinion that the truth will be elicited, and if I judge you\r\naright, it is that you wish to discover whether it harmonizes with\r\nyour preconceived notions or not.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nLOW MOOR, _1st May_, 1845.\r\n\r\nHENRY BRIGGS, ESQ.\r\n\r\nI duly received your pamphlet on the use of lime, for which I am\r\nmuch obliged, and am delighted to perceive that you confirm the\r\nidea (expressed in my pamphlet on the growth of wheat every year\r\non the same land) that the excessive use of lime is ultimately\r\ninjurious to the fertility of the soil to which it is applied.\r\nThis, coming from a gentleman of your reputation and experience,\r\nwill, I hope, induce someone capable of performing the experiment\r\nto endeavour to ascertain with precision how much lime it is\r\ndesirable to apply to an acre to give the best results, and with\r\nthe least waste, assuming that the land contained little or none\r\nprevious to the experiment; and it would also be desirable to\r\nascertain whether it is better, in an economical point of view, to\r\napply a small quantity every year, or a larger quantity every\r\nthird or fourth. My own opinion is in favour of the former method,\r\nexcept that it is difficult to get it ploughed in, particularly in\r\nwet weather, immediately after spreading (which is essential where\r\nyou grow wheat on the same land every year) without injuring the\r\nfeet of the horses. You speak of ten days or a fortnight being\r\nnecessary to neutralize caustic lime, but our horses had their\r\nfeet injured by it six weeks after it had been spread on the land,\r\nlast year, although the weather had been wet almost the whole of\r\nthe time, say from the beginning of February to the middle of\r\nMarch. You appear to think that lime will replace silica in the\r\nwheat plant. Whose authority have you for this? It will be very\r\nimportant to establish this supposition, but I fear it is too good\r\nnews to be true. On referring to your letter, I find you don't say\r\nwhat I supposed you did, but that the lime liberates the soluble\r\nsilicates, potash, &c. This may be, and certainly the beneficial\r\neffects of lime in growing wheat are not to be explained by any\r\nother hypothesis with which I am acquainted. I am this year trying\r\nsome experiments to ascertain (if I can) the cause of clover-\r\nsickness, and I hope to be in a position to say whether your\r\nsupposition that lime, gypsum, &c. will prevent it, is correct. My\r\nexperiments so far are opposed to this theory, but it is not very\r\nsafe or philosophical to draw conclusions from one or two\r\nexperiments only. I doubt the possibility of making silicate of\r\nsoda by merely mixing lime, sand, and salt together, as my\r\nchemical friends tell me this cannot be accomplished unless the\r\nsilex and the alkali are fused together. If a soluble silicate of\r\nsoda can be made in the way you mention, it will be a great saving\r\nof expense. Has it been tried? You have no doubt seen a report of\r\nthe enormous crop of wheat grown in a field in Norfolk last year\r\n(90 bushels to the acre), and that the Royal Agricultural Society\r\nhave determined to have the soil analyzed by Dr. Playfair. This is\r\nvery desirable, but as Dr. Playfair is more of a lecturing than an\r\nanalyzing chemist, I think it is very necessary that his analysis\r\nshould be checked by another, made by the most eminent chemist\r\nthat Europe can produce, for 90 bushels is so unheard-of a crop,\r\nthat no expense should be spared which would enable us to\r\nascertain what the soil contained to enable it to produce such a\r\ncrop, which is the more remarkable as the field seems to have been\r\na good many years under the plough. As your Wakefield Farmers'\r\nClub has many wealthy members in it, allow me to hint the\r\ndesirableness of your undertaking this analysis, which, if\r\nproperly performed, will be worth a thousand times more than its\r\ncost. When you are aware that even Davy missed 16 per cent. of\r\nalumina in one of his analyses and that the chemists of the\r\npresent day don't seem to have detected the potash which exists so\r\nabundantly in potato-tops, you will, I think, agree how\r\nexceedingly important it is that such analysis should be checked\r\nby others, made without any communication between the parties. You\r\nspeak of an original letter of Liebig's appearing in the \"Farmer's\r\nJournal.\" On what subject is it? as I have no means of referring\r\nto the periodical in question. Does it throw any light upon the\r\nnew manure for which he is said to be taking out a patent? You\r\nspeak of humus and humic acid. What do you understand by humus?\r\nas, according to Liebig, humus sometimes means one thing and\r\nsometimes another, and he appears to treat it very much as modern\r\nchemists treat phlogiston, as something which they don't\r\ncomprehend, but which they need to explain the phenomena of\r\nvegetation. If you are a believer in humus, what is it composed\r\nof, and how does it act in forwarding vegetation? I suppose you\r\nwill reply, By combining with oxygen and forming humic acid. But\r\nwould not the theory of the decomposition of carbon do quite as\r\nwell? I don't perceive the injurious effects of quicklime upon\r\ngrass land which you anticipate in your paper, but the contrary,\r\nand the more caustic it is the more beneficial is its action, so\r\nfar as I can judge from my own experiments; and it is my practice\r\nin liming grass land to spread it as soon as I can get it into the\r\nstate of flour. I shall be glad to hear the result of your\r\nelectrical experiment--at present I am rather sceptical on the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nP.S.--Am I to suppose that you have abandoned the idea of manuring\r\nan acre of wheat for thirteen shillings?\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nTHE CULTIVATION OF WHEAT.\r\n\r\n_October 1st_, 1852.\r\n\r\nTo the Editor of the \"Manchester Guardian.\"\r\n\r\nThe increasing quantity of agricultural produce consumed in this\r\ncountry makes it desirable that the cultivation of the land should\r\nbe carried to the highest point consistent with profit; and the\r\nincreasing scarcity of agricultural labourers will shortly render\r\nit difficult for the farmers in some districts to gather in their\r\ncrops. It therefore becomes increasingly desirable that every\r\nmechanical contrivance which will facilitate their doing so should\r\nbe made as perfect as possible; and also that the crops themselves\r\nshould be so cultivated as to make these mechanical aids to work\r\nto the greatest advantage.\r\n\r\nBut it has been a difficult matter (at least in the wet climate of\r\nLancashire) to ascertain how far it is prudent to manure for\r\nwheat, for in unfavourable seasons the plant runs so much to straw\r\nthat it is liable to lodge, and become mildewed; in which cases\r\nthe manure is not only wasted, but becomes positively injurious,\r\nas appears to be the case in the South of England this year, and\r\nas was also the case in the North in 1845, when every shilling\r\nexpended in manuring the wheat crops of that year made the crop at\r\nleast a shilling worse than if no manure had been applied.\r\n\r\nBut if we could find a wheat so short in the straw that it would\r\nbear heavy manuring without being lodged, wheat-growing would be a\r\nfar less hazardous occupation than it is at present, and we might\r\nconfidently calculate on a far greater production than we can now.\r\n\r\nThe following appear to me to be some of the advantages of growing\r\na short-strawed wheat:--\r\n\r\n1st. It will bear highly manuring without lodging, and with much\r\nless liability to mildew, than a long-strawed wheat.\r\n\r\n2nd. The proportion of grain to straw is greater in short than in\r\nlong-strawed wheat.\r\n\r\n3rd. As it very rarely lodges, it will be far better suited to the\r\nreaping-machine than a long-strawed wheat; and no doubt other\r\nadvantages will occur to the minds of experienced agriculturists.\r\n\r\nWhen making these assertions I ought to state that my experience\r\nof wheat-growing does not extend beyond the counties of York and\r\nLancaster, but from what I can learn of the agriculture of more\r\nsoutherly districts, I fancy these opinions of mine will be found\r\ncorrect even there. I may be asked to prove my assertion, and I\r\nwill endeavour to do so.\r\n\r\nI have been experimenting on the growth of wheat for the last ten\r\nor eleven years--particularly with reference to the practicability\r\nof doing this on the same land year after year; and that I might\r\ndo it in the most satisfactory manner, I have varied my seed-wheat\r\nand my manure very frequently: but I very soon discovered that the\r\nadvantages of abundance of manure and high cultivation did not\r\ninsure good crops of wheat, inasmuch as in our moist climate, we\r\nhad not one summer in five that was favourable, and consequently\r\nthe crop was generally lodged, and the straw mildewed. I found\r\nthat the time of sowing, and also of applying the manure, were\r\nmatters of great importance, and it occurred to me that the remedy\r\nwould be--a straw so short, that it would not lodge when highly\r\nmanured. I consequently addressed a query to the \"Gardener's\r\nChronicle,\" asking what was the shortest-strawed variety of wheat\r\nknown, and was told that Piper's Thickset was so; I therefore got\r\nsome of this sort from Mr. Piper, which I have cultivated since\r\n1847. It is a coarse red wheat, but the quality has improved with\r\nme every year, and this season _being the third successive crop on\r\nthe same land_, I have nearly eight quarters to the statute acre\r\nfrom this variety.\r\n\r\n2. The proportion of wheat in Piper's Thickset is 38 per cent. of\r\nthe gross weight of the crop; in the Hopetown wheat (I speak of my\r\nown crops only), 34 per cent.\r\n\r\n3. Not having seen a reaping-machine, it may seem absurd in me to\r\nsay that short-strawed wheat is better adapted to it than long-\r\nstrawed; but every report of the working of these machines goes to\r\nshow that, so far, they are not well adapted to the cutting of\r\nlaid corn; therefore a variety that always stands upright will be\r\nmuch better suited to the working of them.\r\n\r\nI have been trying for the last six years to obtain (by cross-\r\nbreeding) a wheat of good quality, and with a straw shorter than\r\nPiper's, but hitherto with indifferent success; but, thanks to the\r\nkindness of Messrs. Brownells, of Liverpool, who furnished me with\r\nmany samples of Chilian wheat about three years ago, I have now\r\ngot varieties much shorter in the straw than Piper's, and some\r\nwhich appear to be of much better quality, but these will require\r\nto be tested for a year or two before I can speak decisively about\r\nthem. The Chilian varieties are very difficult to acclimatize. The\r\noriginal samples were beautiful white wheats, very much resembling\r\nthe Australian, but when grown in Lancashire they resemble rye\r\nmore than wheat, and three years' sowing has not much improved\r\nthem. It has, however, enabled me  to obtain crosses which seem\r\nbetter adapted to the soil and climate, and so short in the straw\r\nthat the highest manuring produces no tendency to lodge.\r\n\r\nIf we could obtain a variety of wheat of good quality, which,\r\ninstead of two tons of straw and one of wheat to the acre,\r\nproduced a ton and a half of each, it might be profitably\r\ncultivated, and the differences in the chemical composition of\r\ngrain and straw are not so very great as to make me despair of\r\nthis being done some time or other. It may be asked, Where can a\r\nshort-strawed wheat of good quality be procured? To this I am\r\nafraid the reply will be, Nowhere at present. But can none of our\r\nexpert manipulators, who rejoice exceedingly when they cross-breed\r\na geranium or a fuchsia, turn their attention to the cross-breeding\r\nof wheat? Cannot the Royal Agricultural Society offer a premium\r\nfor a short-strawed wheat of good quality? Do none of the great\r\nagriculturists themselves see how desirable such a wheat would be\r\nfor the agriculture of this country? Apparently not; for with the\r\nexception of Mr. Raynbird, of Hampshire, I am not aware of one\r\nscientific operator who is endeavouring to produce such a wheat.\r\nMy own attempts at cross-breeding are such as may be tried by\r\nanyone who has sufficient perseverance, and (with one or two\r\nexceptions, of doubtful success) have been confined to sowing the\r\ndifferent varieties I wished to cross in contiguous drills, and\r\nthen sowing the produce of these. At the second harvest I\r\ncarefully select such ears as differ from both varieties, and at\r\nthe same time seem by their quality of grain and the shortness of\r\ntheir straw to be the best suited to my wishes. It has been, no\r\ndoubt, to the accidental contact of distinct varieties that we owe\r\nthe numerous kinds now known to agriculturists, and which differ\r\nfrom each other in colour, quality, yield, and comparative value\r\nin the various districts in which they are grown.\r\n\r\nFully sensible of my inability to do justice to this important\r\nsubject, I yet hope (if you do me the honour to publish my letter)\r\nthat my remarks may induce scientific men to consider it; for it\r\nappears unaccountable to me that hitherto they seem to have\r\nthought it unworthy of their attention.\r\n\r\nP.S.--There is still time to try the experiment during the present\r\nseason. If any gentleman wishes to try the short-strawed Chilian\r\nwheat, I shall be glad to give him a sample of it for the purpose\r\nof cross-breeding. Samples were sent to Mr. H. Briggs, Mr.\r\nRaynbird, and Mr. Stevenson, Stockport.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n_January 27th_, 1848.\r\n\r\nTo the Editor of the \"Agricultural Gazette.\"\r\n\r\nYou invite persons who have grown good crops of grain or turnips\r\nto forward you the particulars. I therefore enclose you an account\r\nof an attempt which I made to grow wheat on the same land year\r\nafter year, that account reaching to the fourth white crop in\r\n1844. As I still continue the experiment, I shall be in a position\r\nto continue the account up to the present time (as I am now\r\nthreshing out the last year's crop), and will send it to you if\r\nyou think it worthy of insertion in the \"Agricultural Gazette.\"\r\n\r\nIf the account I now send is not worth inserting, please to send\r\nit to your correspondent A. W., who doubted whether there were\r\nauthenticated instances of land producing eighty, seventy, or even\r\nfifty bushels to the acre.\r\n\r\nI attribute my success in growing wheat to the use of silicate of\r\nsoda, and yet, singularly enough, until now I have been unable to\r\ninduce anyone else to try it. This season, however, several\r\npersons have applied to me to procure it for them. Among them is\r\nthe talented editor of the \"Liverpool Times,\" whose farm at Barton\r\nMoss shows what good management will accomplish on very\r\nunpromising soils. If, as I hope will be the case, the silicate of\r\nsoda should supply to peat its greatest deficiency, no one will\r\nmore readily discover it than Mr. Baines.\r\n\r\nIn the use of silicates of soda and potash, one precaution is very\r\nnecessary, namely, that you really have a soluble silicate, not a\r\nmere mechanical mixture of ground flint and alkali. This is a very\r\ndifferent thing, and one which, if it be not carefully guarded\r\nagainst, will lead to nothing but disappointment.\r\n\r\nAgain, the silicate of soda may be properly made, in the first\r\ninstance, but in a long exposure to the atmosphere, the soda\r\nattracts carbonic acid, and is liberated from the silex, and this\r\nhas disappointed my expectation more than once.\r\n\r\nAgain, though I consider it desirable to defer the application of\r\nsoluble silicates until vegetation has made a fair start in the\r\nspring, yet in one instance I delayed the application of it so\r\nlong that there was not moisture to dissolve it until the end of\r\nJune, and then the plant began to send up suckers from the roots,\r\nand the crop was seriously injured by it; but this was in an\r\nexceedingly dry spring, and may not happen again for many years.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nCLITHEROE, _March 7th_, 1848.\r\n\r\nIn continuing my attempts to grow wheat on the same land year\r\nafter year, I observed that the crop of 1845 was very seriously\r\ninjured by the deficient drainage--the old drains having been\r\ndestroyed by the subsoil plough. It was therefore necessary to\r\nreplace them; they were accordingly put in four feet deep. This\r\ntook up so much time, that the season for sowing wheat had gone\r\nby, and the ground was cropped with potatoes, which were dug up in\r\nSeptember, and the wheat might have been got in early in October;\r\nbut seeing in your paper that sowing too early was not advisable,\r\nand also being carried away by the arguments of the thin-seeders,\r\nI deferred sowing until the middle of November, and also put in\r\nlittle seed, and the weather proving very unfavourable when the\r\nwheat was coming up, there was not half plant enough in the\r\nspring, and I hesitated whether to plough up the ground or to\r\ndrill in barley. I determined to do the latter. It was put in on\r\nthe 18th April, and wheat and barley grew up together, and when\r\ncut and threshed, it yielded 48 bushels to the acre.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nON THE GRAVELLING OF CLAY SOILS.\r\n\r\nThere is an old story of a man, who, having a very stony field,\r\ndetermined to experiment on the value of these stones in the\r\ngrowth of his crops.\r\n\r\nWith this view he divided his field into three equal parts. From\r\nNo. 1 he gathered all the stones, which he spread upon No. 3,\r\nleaving No. 2 in its original condition. He then sowed barley over\r\nthe whole field, and carefully noted the results. The story ends\r\nby saying that No. 1 bore a miserably poor crop, No. 2 a tolerable\r\none, and No. 3 a splendid one.\r\n\r\nI quote this story as a text on which I wish to speak as to the\r\nadvantage of gravelling heavy clay soils. Some weeks since I spent\r\na few days at the village of Milnthorpe, in Westmoreland, and\r\nduring one day with Mr. Hutton, the celebrated bone-setter, I\r\nremarked that the land was very stony, being covered with stones\r\n(not pebbles) having very much the appearance of road metal. He\r\nreplied, that these stones were essential to the fertility of the\r\nsoil, and said that some years before there was a great demand for\r\nsuch material in the neighbourhood of Preston, and the high prices\r\nstimulated the farmers to gather these stones from their land, and\r\nsend them to Preston; but the consequences were so injurious to\r\nthe growth of their crops, that they were compelled--at least\r\nthose who had the means of doing so--to lead stones again upon\r\ntheir land before their crops would grow again with the vigour\r\nwhich they had before the stones were abstracted. This brought to\r\nmind what had occurred in my own farm practice. A church was built\r\nin the neighbourhood, and the stones for it were hewn on the\r\ncorner of a field which was afterwards sown with wheat, and I\r\nremarked that the straw was much brighter, the ripening was\r\nforwarded ten days, and the sample was much better where the\r\nstones had been hewn than elsewhere in the field. (The stones of\r\nwhich the church was built were of ordinary sandstone, probably\r\nmillstone grit.)\r\n\r\nBorrowing from this hint, I had the field covered with about 400\r\ncartloads of alluvial gravel (from the bed of the river) to the\r\nacre, and the land was then ploughed two furrows deep, one plough\r\nfollowing the other. Previous to this gravelling, the land was a\r\nstiff, obdurate clay nearly to the surface. The subsequent effect\r\nwas the doubling, or more probably trebling the value of the land,\r\nwhich has now become a nice friable soil.\r\n\r\nI was much amused with the criticisms of some of the neighbouring\r\nfarmers (men of the old school), one of whom remarked that he had\r\nseen land tilled (manured) in various ways before my time, but\r\nuntil now he had never seen a field tilled with cobble-stones. I\r\nsaid, \"What is your objection to it, John?\" \"Why, ye see, it makes\r\nth' land so poor.\" I replied, \"Making anything or anybody poor,\r\nmeans robbing them of something. If you had twenty shillings in\r\nyour pocket, and I filled it up with these cobble-stones, how much\r\npoorer would you be? Of what have I robbed this field by putting\r\ngravel into it?\" \"Why, of nothing; but it looks so queer.\" I said,\r\n\"John, did you never hear of a man gathering the stones off his\r\nfield, and then having to lead them back again?\" \"Yes, I have; but\r\nthen they were _natural_ to the soil.\" I said, \"What does manuring\r\nland mean, but putting something into it of which it is deficient?\r\nYou don't till a muck-midden. If in stony land stones are\r\nessential for the vigorous growth of the crop, is it not\r\nexceedingly probable that they will be still more beneficial on\r\nstiff land which has no stones in it?\"\r\n\r\nThis is a doctrine I tried many years since to inculcate upon our\r\nfriend Mechi, and some of his land (I speak of its condition\r\ntwenty years since) needed such a gravelling as much as any land I\r\never saw. Whether he adopted my suggestion, or his land remains\r\nin the same condition now as then, I don't know; but if it does, I\r\nwould just suggest to him and to all landed proprietors who own\r\nstiff clay lands, if they are near to gravel-pits, to try a small\r\nportion by gravelling it freely, and let us hear the results.\r\n\r\n_December 2nd_, 1871.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nCOTTON.\r\n\r\n_June 1st_, 1842.\r\n\r\nJ. KINDERMANN, ESQ.\r\n\r\nI have for some time intended to call your attention to the\r\nimportance of attempting to grow fine cotton in Peru, but my\r\ninability to do justice to the subject, both from my being\r\npractically unacquainted with any mode of growing cotton and my\r\ngeneral want of information, has hitherto prevented me; but as I\r\nmade you a promise to that effect yesterday, I have endeavoured to\r\nput a few suggestions on paper, and hope that if they be carefully\r\nacted upon, some benefit may be derived from the experiments.\r\n\r\nWe have been (as you are aware) consumers of Peruvian cotton to\r\nsome extent for the last six or eight months, and from the\r\nobservations I have made on it during that time, I have no\r\nhesitation in saying that it possesses many excellences: it is\r\nlong enough (almost too long), very sound in staple, and where\r\nwell managed of a very good colour. Its defects are coarseness and\r\nharshness of staple, and if these could be removed I don't see\r\nwhat is to prevent its rivalling the Egyptian and Sea Islands\r\ncotton, any considerable approximation to which would very\r\nmaterially enhance its value, seeing that the highest quotation\r\nfor Sea Island, was last week 30d. per lb. (2s. 6d.), whilst the\r\nhighest for Peruvian was no more than 6 1/2 d.\r\n\r\nWith the view of improving the quality of the cotton in Peru, I\r\nwould strongly recommend you to send seeds of various kinds,\r\npacked in air-tight boxes, particularly Sea Island and Egyptian,\r\nwhich some of the cotton-brokers would easily procure from the\r\nspinners using these descriptions, and, judging from what I hear\r\nof the climate of both countries, I should think the Egyptian\r\nwould go to a very similar atmosphere and mode of cultivation to\r\nthat of the country where it had been raised, which would probably\r\nrender it more easy to acclimatize, and, of course, make it more\r\nlikely to succeed than a sort of cotton which had been grown under\r\ndissimilar circumstances of soil, climate, and mode of cultivation.\r\n\r\nThese seeds when sown, ought (with the exceptions hereafter to be\r\nmentioned) to be planted at such a distance from all other cottons\r\nas to render it very unlikely for the wind or insects to carry the\r\npollen from the flowers of one kind to those of another; for\r\nwithout this precaution, such is the tendency in many genera of\r\nplants to hybridize (and I believe, from what I have heard, there\r\nis this tendency in the different varieties of cotton) or cross-\r\nbreed with each other, that, however good the quality in the first\r\ninstance, they would all revert to the old variety in a year or\r\ntwo in consequence of the great preponderance of that variety over\r\nany newly-introduced ones. So much are the growers of turnip-seed\r\nfor sale in England aware of the importance of attending to this,\r\nthat the greatest precautions are taken to remove all _cruciform\r\nplants_ from the vicinity of the field whilst their turnips are in\r\nflower, as there is such a tendency in them all to hybridize that\r\nthe quality of the seed is often injured by the wild mustard\r\n(_Sinapis arvensis_) springing up in the same or the adjoining\r\nfields; whilst, on the other hand, by carefully selecting the best\r\nbulbs for seed, and by judiciously crossing one variety with\r\nanother, new sorts are obtained, combining the excellences of\r\nboth. This leads me to observe, that probably seed of foreign\r\nvarieties of cotton may not thrive well in the first instance, and\r\nI would therefore strongly recommend the gentlemen who may make\r\nthe experiment carefully to select seed from the plants on their\r\nestates which they see are growing the best and finest cotton, and\r\nsow them in contact with a few seeds of each of the sorts you may\r\nsend out, carefully removing them in every instance as far as may\r\nbe practicable from the vicinity of all other cotton; and then\r\nagain sowing the seeds which are obtained from the plants thus\r\nraised in contiguity to each other, and carefully examining the\r\ncotton grown upon each of them, it is more than probable they will\r\nfind that _some_ of the plants will be varieties partaking of the\r\ncharacter of both the parent kinds, and by selecting the best of\r\nthese and sowing them only (still apart from all other cotton),\r\nthere is little doubt that much benefit will be derived by the\r\npersevering and skilful cultivator.\r\n\r\nI have heard it stated that the origin of Sea Island cotton is to\r\nbe traced to something of this kind. An observing and experimental\r\nplanter, by carefully examining his cotton, and by sowing his seed\r\nonly from those plants that produced the finest and longest\r\nstaple, at last arrived at the excellent quality which is now\r\nknown by that name.\r\n\r\nLook, again, at what has been done in Egypt by the introduction of\r\nbetter varieties of cotton. There these improved varieties have by\r\nno means had a fair chance of showing what they are capable of\r\nbecoming, inasmuch as the wretched cultivator has not the\r\nslightest inducement to improve their quality--he gets no more per\r\npound for the finest and cleanest cotton than he does for the\r\ncoarsest and dirtiest, and therefore it is not very likely to\r\nimprove under his care. But with all this neglect and want of\r\nmanagement, we can see by what it is, what it would most probably\r\nbecome in the hands of an enterprising and intelligent man who\r\nknew that every improvement he made in its quality would be to his\r\nown advantage. Assuming that your Peruvian friends could so far\r\nimprove the quality of their cotton as to double its value in this\r\nmarket (and I don't think myself too sanguine in expecting more\r\nthan this), with very little extra labour nearly all the\r\nadditional price would be profit.\r\n\r\nBut supposing even that cross-breeding, or hybridizing, as the\r\nhorticulturists call it, does not frequently occur naturally in\r\ncotton, it is well known that it is very easy to effect it\r\nartificially by prematurely unfolding the petals and with fine\r\nscissors cutting away all the stamens before impregnation takes\r\nplace. This requires to be carefully done, so as not to injure the\r\npetals, and they will then close again of themselves, and when\r\nthey expand naturally, then impregnate the stigma of the flower\r\nwith the pollen of the kind you want to cross with. We owe many of\r\nour finest varieties of fruits to this practice. The late Mr.\r\nPayne Knight was very successful in raising new varieties of many\r\nsorts of fruit in this way, and it appears to me from the\r\nexperiments I have made that the more frequently this cross-\r\nbreeding takes place, the more easy (within certain limits) is it\r\nto extend it until cultivation has so completely changed the\r\ncharacter of the plant that it bears very little resemblance to\r\nits original stock. There is nothing growing wild like our\r\ncabbages, turnips, and cauliflowers; nor even like our carrots,\r\ncelery, and asparagus. Where are the originals of our wheat,\r\nbarley, rye, beans, and peas? Many of these appear to be so\r\ncompletely transformed by cultivation that we don't know where to\r\nlook for the parent stocks from which they originated. But I am\r\nforgetting cotton altogether, yet beg to refer to the preceding\r\nparagraph to show how much is owing to careful cultivation, and\r\ntrust that it may not be without its use if my letter induces your\r\nfriends to make the experiments here suggested, even though their\r\nfirst attempts are unsuccessful.\r\n\r\nThis letter was translated into Spanish and circulated in Peru,\r\nbut with what success I do not know. It was also published in the\r\n\"Gardener's Chronicle,\" and led to a reply from Dr. Royle, which\r\noccasioned the following letter.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n_August 14th_, 1845.\r\n\r\nTo the Editor of the \"Gardener's Chronicle.\"\r\n\r\nI am very glad that my letter and your remarks on the improvement\r\nof cotton in India have attracted the attention of so able a\r\ncorrespondent as G. F. R. (Dr. Royle), who appears to be\r\nconversant with a good deal of what has been attempted there. No\r\ndoubt there are, as he states, great diversities of soil and\r\nclimate in so extensive a country as India; and if so, although\r\nthere may be some which are not adapted to the growth of either\r\nthe _Gossypium Barbadense_ or the _Gossypium Peruvianum_, there\r\nmust be both soil and climate suited to them in various localities\r\nin that country.\r\n\r\nMy chief reason for suspecting that the injury arises from the new\r\nkinds hybridizing with the indigenous cotton, is, that very good\r\ncotton has been grown from both varieties in the first generation,\r\nbut when the seed from this first crop is sown again, the quality\r\nalways deteriorates (at least all the gentlemen say so with whom I\r\nhave conversed on this subject). I have a sample of Indian-grown\r\ncotton of excellent quality from Pernambuco seed, worth twice as\r\nmuch as the best Surat cotton I ever saw; but I cannot learn that\r\nanything deserving the name of aught but a sample was ever\r\nobtained. We hear of no increase in the quantity of this improved\r\nvariety; it does not--like cotton in the United States--go on from\r\nten bags to ten thousand, in eight or ten years; on the contrary,\r\nso far as I can learn, it dwindles away to nothing. The Tinnivelly\r\ncotton brought forward as an example by your correspondent is no\r\nexception to this--it is no more like Bourbon cotton, than Bowed\r\ncotton is like Sea Island--at least none that I ever saw. Bourbon\r\nis a long, silky-stapled cotton, whilst Tinnivelly has the\r\nshortness and inequality of fibre common to most of the cotton of\r\nIndia. It is generally much cleaner than the cotton grown on the\r\nwestern side of India, but this arises from the greater care in\r\npicking it.\r\n\r\nAn intelligent friend of mine, now in India, says that the pod of\r\ncotton is overhung by a brown leaf (bractea?), and if the cotton\r\nis gathered early in the morning, whilst the dew is on the plant,\r\nthis leaf is tough and does not break, and the cotton is gathered\r\nclean; but if it is picked after the dew has evaporated, this leaf\r\nis brittle, and gets mixed with the cotton in the picking. But he\r\nsays that no persuasion can induce the ryots to keep that which is\r\npicked in the morning from that which is gathered in the heat of\r\nthe day. He also suggests that the cotton should be irrigated\r\nduring its growth, and alleges as a motive for doing this, that in\r\nEgypt and Peru no good cotton can be grown without resorting to\r\nit. But the cases are not exactly parallel, inasmuch as no rain\r\nfalls in either of these countries, whilst rain is most abundant\r\nin India, eighty or ninety inches of rain sometimes falling at\r\nBombay in three months during the monsoon.\r\n\r\nAnother intelligent gentleman with whom I have conversed on this\r\nsubject since my former letter was written, and who has resided at\r\nBombay many years, where he has paid much attention to this\r\nsubject, tells me that the gentleman entrusted by the East India\r\nCompany with the management of one of the experimental cotton\r\nestates, assures him he has grown excellent Orleans cotton, and\r\nthat the ryots were so satisfied with its superiority over the\r\nindigenous kind that 1,200 begahs (say 300 acres) were planted\r\nwith it. But this was two years ago, and as the disturbances took\r\nplace in this very neighbourhood, he fears these plantations have\r\nperished, as he heard no more of the matter, and had omitted to\r\ninquire of the gentleman entrusted with the management.\r\n\r\nI reserved this until I saw the second letter from your\r\ncorrespondent G. F. R., which I have now read, as well as an\r\narticle on the same subject in the \"Manchester Guardian,\" in which\r\nit is stated that 20,000 acres are now under cultivation, planted\r\nwith this improved cotton. I fear this is too good news to be\r\ntrue. My informant is a gentleman who was in correspondence with\r\nMr. Mercer, the superintendent of these cotton estates, or some of\r\nthem, and I have again questioned him. He says that the crop which\r\nwould be gathered in March last, would amount to what I have\r\nstated (1,200 begahs), according to Mr. Mercer's letter to him,\r\nbut he says it is now twelve months since he heard from Mr.\r\nMercer, as he left Bombay for England shortly after. His fear was\r\nthat none of this cotton would be gathered, as the disturbances\r\nwhich took place in Central India, and which required so long a\r\ntime to quell them, were in this very district. If your\r\ncorrespondent G. F. R. has got samples of this improved cotton, of\r\nthe second or third generation, he would confer a great obligation\r\nupon me by sending me a small sample of it by post. But this is\r\nwandering from what I intended to say, which was most heartily to\r\nthank your correspondent for his second communication, which goes\r\nfar to prove the truth of what I had previously supposed, that the\r\ncotton of India is capable of great improvement by being\r\njudiciously crossed with suitable foreign varieties. Your\r\ncorrespondent thinks if the old varieties deteriorate the new when\r\ngrowing in proximity to each other, the new ought, for the same\r\nreason, to improve the old; and no doubt they will, but to a much\r\nsmaller extent. It is said that a man leaping up into the air\r\nattracts the earth (proportionately) as much as the earth attracts\r\nhim, and it may be so with the old and new cotton. What I mean to\r\nsay is, that although some of the old sort of cotton might be\r\nhybridized by the new, the improved variety would be in so small a\r\nquantity that a thousand to one the cultivator would never observe\r\nit; and such is the aversion or indifference to anything new among\r\nthe natives of India, that if an improved plant were observed, it\r\nis again a thousand to one he would take no pains to preserve it;\r\nand if he did, it is again perhaps a thousand to one that it would\r\nbe entirely spoilt in the next generation by being planted among\r\nthe indigenous sorts.\r\n\r\nI trust your correspondent will continue to favour us with his\r\ncommunications whenever he has any fresh information on the\r\nsubject, which, the more it is considered the more important it\r\nseems to be.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nPAPERS ON NATURAL HISTORY.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nWRENS' NESTS.\r\n\r\nTHE Editor of Loudon's \"Magazine of Natural History,\" and one of\r\nhis contributors, Mr. Jennings, were of opinion that the common\r\nWren never lined its nest with feathers. The following contribution\r\nwas sent to the \"Magazine of Natural History\" in consequence of\r\nthis, and led to some discussion afterwards:--\r\n\r\n_April 17th_, 1829.\r\n\r\nMr. Jennings and yourself, in opposition to Montagu, are of\r\nopinion that the Wren never lines its nest with feathers; like the\r\nknights of the gold-and-silver shield, both sides are right. It is\r\ntrue, many Wrens' nests may be found in which there are no\r\nfeathers; but did you ever find either eggs or young ones in them?\r\n\r\nAs far as my observations go, the nest in which the Wren lays its\r\neggs is profusely lined with feathers; but during the period of\r\nincubation, the male--apparently from a desire to be doing\r\nsomething--constructs several nests in the vicinity of the first,\r\nnone of which are lined; and whilst the first nest is so artfully\r\nconcealed as to be found with difficulty, the last is very often\r\nseen. The Wren does not appear to be very careful in the selection\r\nof a site for these cock-nests, as they are called in Yorkshire by\r\nthe schoolboys. I have frequently seen them in the twigs of a\r\nthick thorn hedge, under banks, in haystacks, in ivy bushes, in\r\nold stumps, in the loopholes of buildings, and in one instance in\r\nan old bonnet, which was placed among some peas to frighten away\r\nthe blackcaps.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n_August 15th_, 1831.\r\n\r\nTO PROFESSOR RENNIE.\r\n\r\nIn your edition of Montagu's \"Ornithological Dictionary,\" just\r\npublished, you say--speaking of the Wren--\"An anonymous\r\ncorrespondent of Loudon's 'Magazine of Natural History,' &c. &c.;\"\r\nand you remark, \"There can be no doubt of these supposed 'cock-\r\nnests' being nothing more than unfinished structures of paired\r\nbirds; otherwise, the story would require the support of very\r\nstrong evidence to render it credible.\"\r\n\r\nAs I am the anonymous correspondent alluded to, I forward you a\r\nfew observations of facts tending, as I think, to confirm my view\r\nof the question.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, these nests are far too abundant for the\r\nbirds, which are not plentiful--at least, in this neighbourhood.\r\nAgain, it is at least five to one that any Wren's nest which is\r\nfound during the summer without a lining of hair or feathers is\r\never completed, or has any eggs in it. This I have verified in a\r\nhundred instances, when, having found Wrens' nests, I have visited\r\nthem again at intervals, for the purpose of ascertaining whether\r\nmy opinion of cock-nests was correct.\r\n\r\nFarther, in a small wood adjoining my garden, where I was certain\r\nthere was only one pair of Wrens, I found at least half-a-dozen\r\nnests, not one of which was either lined with feathers or ever had\r\neggs in it; although I discovered they were not all deserted, as I\r\nfound an old bird roosting in one of them. I was induced to be\r\nmore particular in my remarks in consequence of my seeing Mr.\r\nJennings's remarks in the \"Magazine of Natural History;\" and I\r\nsearched, as I supposed, every bank, bush, and stump in the wood\r\ntwo or three times before I could find the breeding-nest, which I\r\nat last discovered in the twigs of a willow on the bank of the\r\nriver, in the centre of a bunch of tangled grass, cotton waste,\r\nand straws which had been left there by the floods, and which the\r\nbird had apparently excavated and in it formed its nest, which was\r\nprofusely lined with rooks' feathers.\r\n\r\nThe fear of being thought tedious prevents my giving other facts\r\nwhich tend, as I think, to prove the correctness of my opinion;\r\nhowever, I will just add that all the persons with whom I have\r\nconversed who take an interest in such pursuits, agree with me in\r\nopinion in this matter.\r\n\r\nThe nest I have just spoken of was also a strong proof that Wrens,\r\nalthough they may not always adapt their materials to the locality\r\nthey have chosen for a nest, frequently do so; and if this is not\r\nwith the intention of concealing it, but merely because the\r\nmaterials are at hand, it serves the purpose of concealment also,\r\nand very effectually. The one I am speaking of was so exactly like\r\nthe other lumps of rubbish which had been left by the floods in\r\nthe same bush, that I did not discover that it was a Wren's nest\r\nuntil I had pulled it out of the twigs; and if a Wren builds its\r\nnest in a haystack--which it frequently does--the front of the\r\nnest is almost invariably composed of the hay from the stack,\r\nwhich prevents its being seen much more effectually than if the\r\nmoss of which the body of the nest is composed were visible on the\r\noutside.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the long-tailed tits occasionally associate to the\r\nnumber of six or seven, and have a nest in common, which is\r\nmentioned in the same page of the \"Magazine of Natural History\" as\r\nthe Wrens' nests, I could prove by the testimony of twenty people\r\nwho saw the nest and young there spoken of. I should be glad to\r\nlearn whether the same thing has been noticed by other people.\r\n\r\nAmong the few rare birds which it has been my good fortune to\r\nprocure is a Woodpecker, which I killed this summer, and which is\r\nnot mentioned in your edition of Montagu, although spoken of by\r\nBewick as a dubious species, under the name of the Middle Spotted\r\nWoodpecker.\r\n\r\nA pair of these birds had built their nest, or rather hatched\r\ntheir young (for there was no nest), in a hole in a decayed ash\r\ntree about twenty feet from the ground. There were two young ones,\r\nwhich I secured, as well as one of the old ones, and they are all\r\nin the possession of a professional friend of mine, who is a\r\ncollector of ornithological specimens.\r\n\r\nThe old one measures 9 1/2 inches long, and weighed 46 1/2 dwts.\r\nan hour after it was killed. The forehead is a dirty buff, the\r\nwhole crown of the head a bright crimson; the irides a dark lead\r\ncolour, and it has a white ring round its neck. In other respects\r\nit corresponds with your description of the _Picus major_. The sex\r\nwas not ascertained. The young ones have also the bright crimson\r\nhead, and differ very materially from the old one.\r\n\r\nThe Chevy Linnet, as the lesser Redpole is called, is found here\r\nthroughout the year, and is at no time a scarce bird with us. It\r\nfrequently builds its nest in the alder and willow bushes, on the\r\nbanks of the brooks or rivers. It is a late breeder, the nests\r\nbeing often met with containing eggs or young in July. In the\r\nwinter it feeds upon the seeds of the alder or the cones of the\r\nlarch, hanging suspended from the twigs like the titmouse.\r\n\r\nWe have also the Gray Wagtail (_Motacilla sulphurea_) with us the\r\nwhole year, but it is rather a rare bird at all times and in all\r\nlocalities with which I am acquainted. (1853:--It is more\r\nplentiful now than it was in 1831.)\r\n\r\nI very strongly suspect Selby is mistaken when he says, \"that\r\nprevious to its departure in September, it assembles in small\r\nflocks or families, which haunt the meadows or bare pastures.\"\r\nThis does not agree with my observations of this bird, although\r\nquite true when applied to the Spring Wagtail (_Motacilla flava_);\r\non the contrary, the Grey Wagtail is solitary throughout the year,\r\nexcept in the breeding season, and never frequents the meadows,\r\nbut is found in the beds of the rivers, brooks, or ditches, where\r\nits shrill note often betrays it to eyes which would otherwise\r\nnever see it.\r\n\r\nThis bird may be easily distinguished from the Spring Wagtail by\r\nits note when flying--yet, notwithstanding the difference is very\r\napparent to a person who hears them both, it is not so easily\r\ndescribed. In attempting to do so, therefore, I hope I shall be\r\nexcused if I don't make the difference so apparent in the\r\ndescription as it is in reality. The latter part of the note of\r\nthe Grey Wagtail when flying is higher in the musical scale than\r\nthe former part, and is very staccato, thus: [BAR OF MUSIC]\r\ngenerally being uttered as the bird makes a spring in the air, [10]\r\nwhilst the latter part of the note of the summer-bird is lower in\r\nthe scale than the former part, which is more prolonged than in\r\nthe note of the Grey Wagtail, and is slurred into the latter part,\r\nsomething in the following manner: [BAR OF MUSIC] Of course I\r\ndon't mean it to be understood that these notes are either of the\r\nsame pitch, or that they bear the same relation to each other that\r\nthe notes of the bird do, but as a rude attempt at illustrating\r\nwhat I could not explain in any other way.\r\n\r\nA singular habit which I have noticed in several individuals of\r\nthis species (_M. sulphurea_) has amused me exceedingly. They were\r\nin the habit of looking at their own images in the windows and\r\nattacking them, uttering their peculiar cry, and pecking and\r\nfluttering against the glass as earnestly as if the object they\r\nsaw was a real rival instead of an imaginary one (a friend who\r\nobserved it, insisted that, Narcissus-like, it was in an ecstasy\r\nof self-admiration). What is more remarkable, two of these\r\ninstances occurred in the autumn, when one would not suppose the\r\nsame motives for animosity to exist that would probably actuate\r\nthem in the spring.\r\n\r\nThe first of these instances was when I was a boy, and was\r\nrepeated daily for several weeks, both against the windows of my\r\nfather's house and those of our neighbour, who, being rather\r\nsuperstitious, was alarmed about it, and came to consult my mother\r\non the subject. She said there was a bird which her brother told\r\nher was a barley-bird (_Motacilla flava_), which was continually\r\nflying against her windows, and as birds were not in the habit of\r\ndoing so generally, she thought something serious was portended by\r\nit. My mother comforted her as well as she could, and I undertook\r\nto rid her of the annoyance, which I did by setting a horsehair-\r\nnoose on one of the window-ledges which it frequented. I soon\r\ncaught it, and by plucking out the under-tail coverts, with which\r\nI wanted to dress _yellow duns_, I effectually cured it of the\r\npropensity--whether, Narcissus-like, it was in an ecstasy of self-\r\nadmiration, or like the cock which attacked its own image in the\r\nboot (which Mr. Robert Warren's poet and painter have immortalized),\r\nit would admit of no rival.\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested, and I think with great probability, that\r\nthe bird was merely attempting to catch the flies which it saw on\r\nthe inside of the panes of glass; but certainly it was not so\r\nsilent about it as these birds generally are when they are\r\nfeeding.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nTHE LONG-TAILED TITMOUSE.\r\n\r\nTo the Editor of \"Loudon's Magazine.\"\r\n\r\nSome years ago, when my brother and myself were seekers of birds'\r\nnests, we found one of the Long-tailed Titmouse (_Parus\r\ncaudatus_), about two miles from home, containing young ones half-\r\nfledged. Being anxious to rear them, we hit upon the plan of\r\ncatching the old ones, and giving them the trouble instead of\r\nourselves. We accordingly set lime-twigs near the nest, and caught\r\nsix old ones out of the seven of which the colony consisted, and\r\nbrought them away in triumph; but the old ones would not eat in\r\nconfinement, and all died but one, which we allowed to escape, in\r\nthe hope that it would come back and rear the young ones. This it\r\ndid, and by the most unwearied exertion reared the whole brood,\r\nsometimes feeding them ten times in a minute.\r\n\r\nNever having seen this social habit stated in any ornithological\r\nwork to which I have access, I am not aware that it is generally\r\nknown to naturalists; but it is right to state that I have only\r\nfound one nest of the species since, and this my avocations would\r\nnot permit me to examine. I am therefore not aware whether the\r\nfact I have stated was an exception to the general habit of the\r\nbird, or whether such is invariably the case. Some of your\r\ncorrespondents will, no doubt, be able to give an answer to this\r\ninquiry.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nIDENTITY OF THE GREEN WITH THE WOOD-SANDPIPER.\r\n\r\nTo the Editor of the \"Magazine of Natural History.\"\r\n\r\nThe question whether the Green and the Wood-Sandpiper are the same\r\nspecies seems from Rennie's edition of Montagu's \"Ornithological\r\nDictionary\" to be undecided; but as a specimen has just come under\r\nmy notice which appears to me to clear up this difficulty, I shall\r\noffer no apology for sending a description of it.\r\n\r\nThe length from the bill to the tail is 10 inches, to the end of\r\nthe toes, 11 3/4 inches; breadth, 17 inches; thigh-joint to the\r\ntoe, 5 1/2 inches. The bill measures 1 5/8 inches from the corner\r\nof the mouth, and is very slender; the upper mandible, which is\r\nblack and slightly curved at the point, is a little longer than\r\nthe lower one, which is a dark green at the base and black at the\r\npoint; a dark streak extends from the base of the upper mandible\r\nto the corner of the eye, and above it is a patch of dirty white\r\nintermixed with minute dusky spots; a small circle of dirty white\r\nsurrounds the eyes; the chin is white; the cheeks, throat, and\r\nforepart of the neck white, spotted with dusky, with which colour\r\na few laminae of each feather are marked their whole length. The\r\nbreast has a dappled stripe of the same colour as the throat\r\nrunning down the middle of it; with this exception it is white, as\r\nare also the belly, vent, and under tail-coverts. The crown of the\r\nhead and hinder part of the neck are a dingy brown, which on the\r\nneck has a shade of ash colour; the bend of the wing and lesser\r\nwing-coverts are a brownish black; the whole upper surface of the\r\nplumage is of a glossy brownish-green, which is spotted on the\r\nmiddle wing-coverts with minute white spots, that change to a\r\ndingy yellow on the back, scapulars, and tertials, the last of\r\nwhich have twelve spots on the outer margin of the feathers, and\r\nsix on the inner one; the tertials are very long, the longest of\r\nthem reaching to within a quarter of an inch of the extreme top of\r\nthe wing, which reaches to the end of the tail; the quill feathers\r\nare wholly black, as are also the secondaries; the upper part of\r\nthe rump is black, and each feather is slightly tipped with white,\r\nwhich forms small wavy lines on that part of the plumage; the\r\nlower part of the rump and upper tail-coverts are pure white; the\r\ntail, which is even at the end, consists of twelve feathers, which\r\nare barred with black and white alternately.\r\n\r\nAt the end of Bewick's description of the Green Sandpiper there is\r\na very exact representation of a covert feather of the tail, and\r\nan inner-wing covert, which will give a better idea of their\r\nappearance than a page of letterpress. The legs are dark green,\r\nthe outer toe connected with the middle one by a membrane as far\r\nas the first joint; toes very slender, middle one 1 1/4 inch long;\r\nweight, 2 3/4 oz. Killed on the 17th September, 1831, near\r\nStonyhurst.\r\n\r\nI have been thus minute in my description from a wish to clear up\r\nthe doubt that appears to exist as to the identity of these two\r\nbirds. The one I have now before me is, undoubtedly, the Green\r\nSandpiper of Bewick, but it corresponds in so many particulars\r\nwith the Wood Sandpiper of Montagu, and appears to combine so many\r\nof the peculiarities of both without exactly agreeing with either,\r\nthat I think it proves their identity satisfactorily. The glossy\r\ngreen of the upper plumage and the barring of the under wing-\r\ncoverts and the tail identify this bird with the Green Sandpiper;\r\nwhilst on the other side the yellowish spots on the scapulars and\r\ntertials, the black rump, the length of the leg, and the web\r\nbetween the outer and middle toes are characteristic of the Wood\r\nSandpiper of Montagu.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nTHE STOAT.\r\n\r\nI. M. (in the \"Magazine of Natural History\") says that the Stoat\r\nis more timid than the weasel, and that it does not change its\r\ncolour as in the more northern parts of the world. I know not why\r\nhe calls it timid, even relatively, as I think it is the most\r\nfearless wild animal we have in the kingdom, in proof of which I\r\nwill mention an incident I witnessed myself. I one day saw a Stoat\r\ncarrying off a large rat it had killed, and I immediately pursued\r\nit, but it stuck so tenaciously to its prey (although it was so\r\nencumbered with its load as to be scarcely able to run at all)\r\nthat I was close upon it before it would abandon it; however, it\r\nthen took refuge in a wall that happened to be close by. I took up\r\nthe rat, and the Stoat put its head out of the wall, spitting and\r\nchattering with every appearance of the most lively indignation\r\nagainst me for having so unjustly robbed it of a lawful prize. I\r\namused myself with watching it for some time, and then being\r\ndesirous of seeing how far its evident desire to recapture its\r\nbooty would overcome its fear of me, I held the rat just before\r\nthe hole in which it was, when after several attempts, in which\r\nits discretion got the better of its valour, it at length screwed\r\nup its courage to the sticking-place, came boldly out of the wall,\r\nand dragged it out of my hand into the hole.\r\n\r\nI know not in what county I. M. lives, nor do I know whether he\r\nmeans to include any part of England in the more northern parts of\r\nthe world, but I do know that the Stoat is white in the winter in\r\nYorkshire, as I have caught and still more frequently seen\r\nspecimens of this colour.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nTHE MARSH TITMOUSE.\r\n\r\nI have been much interested this spring at witnessing in two or\r\nthree instances the tenacity with which the Marsh Titmouse sits on\r\nits nest. Being in a wood near my own house, I perceived a pair of\r\nthese birds in one of the trees, and having seen them in the same\r\nplace several times before, and being desirous of finding the\r\nnest, I sat down to watch their motions. After examining me on all\r\nsides with much chattering and many gesticulations, indicative of\r\ndislike and suspicion, the female flew to the root of a tree,\r\nthree or four yards off, and disappeared, as she had gone to the\r\nopposite side of the tree to that on which I sat; and as there\r\nwere several holes about the root I was at a loss to know in which\r\nthe nest was built, and began to strike the root with a stick,\r\nexpecting her to fly out, but nothing appeared. I then examined\r\nthe holes one by one, and whilst doing so heard her hissing and\r\npuffing from within, in such a way that if I had not known she was\r\nthere I should have thought it was a snake rather than a bird.\r\nHowever, as she would not come out, and the hole was so small that\r\nI could not get my hand in, I was obliged to raise the siege until\r\nnext morning, when I returned armed with a hammer and chisel with\r\nwhich to storm her citadel. As the wood was sound, the hole small,\r\nand the nest six or eight inches within the tree, I was five or\r\nten minutes before I could get to it, during which I gave her\r\nrepeated opportunities of escaping if she chose; but she still sat\r\non her nest, puffing and pecking at the stick that I thrust in in\r\norder to drive her off. She at last crept to the further edge of\r\nthe nest, which I then took out, as I wanted it for one of my\r\nfriends who is a collector of eggs, but on attempting to blow one\r\nI found they had been sat upon too long, and I then felt desirous\r\nof seeing whether the old bird would hatch them after having her\r\nnest torn from under her, and I turned back to the tree whence I\r\nhad taken them, and found her still sitting in the hole where I\r\nhad left her. I regret to add that the humane part of my\r\nexperiment did not succeed, for although she remained after I had\r\nreturned the nest to its place, she left it immediately after, and\r\ndid not return to it again.\r\n\r\nAnother instance which I witnessed was in a nest containing young\r\nones. This was also at the root of a tree, but the situation did\r\nnot appear to be so well chosen as is usually the case with the\r\nTitmouse tribe; for in this instance the hole went quite through\r\nthe tree, and on one side was large enough to admit the hand. As\r\nthe young ones were exposed to the weather, and were also liable\r\nto be seen by anyone going along the adjoining footpath, I\r\nattempted to remedy this defect by covering the larger hole with a\r\nsod, which to a casual observer would appear to have grown there.\r\nOn taking the sod off one day, to see how the nestlings were going\r\non, I perceived that a clod of earth had fallen from the sod upon\r\nthem, and I took a stick and hooked it out, lest it should smother\r\nthem. Whilst I was doing this I perceived the old one sat on the\r\nfurther side of the nest, so still and quiet that until I\r\nperceived her eye I fancied she was dead; and she also endured\r\nseveral pokings with the stick before she would move, although the\r\nhole on the opposite side of the tree enabled her to escape\r\nwhenever she thought proper.\r\n\r\nPerhaps Mr. Rennie, in his next edition of Montagu's Dictionary,\r\nwill give us a new name for this bird, as the one it has at\r\npresent is no more applicable to this species than it is to the\r\n_Parus caeruleus_, or the _Parus major_, and not half so much so\r\nas it would be to the _Parus biarnicus_; and he has changed good\r\nnames into bad ones with far less reason, witness _Corvus\r\nfrugilegus_ into _Corvus predatorius_. The former name is strictly\r\napplicable to that species, and to that alone; and so useful a\r\nbird does not deserve the name of a thief. The Chaffinch (which\r\nreceived its name of _Coelebs_ from Linnaeus on account of the\r\nmales alone remaining in Sweden in the winter, which fact is\r\ncorroborated by White, who found scarcely any but females in\r\nHampshire during that season) has had its name changed by Mr.\r\nRennie into _Spiza_. The old name is characteristic of a\r\nremarkable fact in the habits of this bird; why the new one is\r\nmore appropriate (neither understanding Greek, nor having read\r\nAristotle), I cannot say. Will Mr. Rennie condescend to enlighten\r\nme?\r\n\r\nOnce for all--if we are to have a new nomenclature, let a\r\ncommittee of able naturalists decide upon it, or let us submit to\r\nthe authority of a master (for instance Linnaeus or Temminck), but\r\ndon't let every bookmaker who publishes a work on Natural History,\r\nrejecting names long established and universally received, give\r\nnew ones in such a way as serves only to show his own presumption\r\nand to confuse what it ought to be his business to elucidate.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nCREEPER.\r\n\r\nThe Nuthatch does not occur in this, and I doubt if in any part of\r\nLancashire, but the Creeper is very common, and is a bird with the\r\nhabits and peculiar call of which I have been acquainted from my\r\nchildhood. Mr. Bree, who combines with accurate and extensive\r\ninformation, an amiable and pleasant manner of communicating it,\r\nhas not, I perceive, witnessed the Creepers associating with the\r\nTitmice in winter, at which I am rather surprised, and think if\r\nthey are numerous in his neighbourhood, he will hereafter not fail\r\nto perceive them among the small flocks of Titmice which associate\r\nthrough the winter.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nWRENS' NESTS.\r\n\r\nIn Mr. Rennie's edition of Montagu's Dictionary, and also in his\r\n\"Architecture of Birds,\" after copying what I have said on the\r\nsubject of Wrens' nests being lined with feathers, he says:--\r\n\"There can be no doubt, I apprehend, of these supposed cock-nests\r\nbeing nothing more than the unfinished structures of paired birds;\r\notherwise the story would require the support of strong evidence\r\nto render it credible.\" Mr. Rennie afterwards goes on to say that\r\nin two instances he had seen nests which had about half-a-dozen\r\nfeathers interwoven into the linings with hair; and Mr. Jennings,\r\nif I recollect aright, as I have not the work to refer to at\r\npresent, says that Wrens don't line their nests with anything but\r\nmoss, and he thinks Montagu is in error when he says they are\r\nlined with feathers. Along with this I send you three or four\r\nWrens' nests, which you will perceive have abundance of feathers\r\nin the inside; and although the Wren will occasionally use cows'\r\nhair along with the feathers, yet I am persuaded from the\r\nlocalities in which I have met with them, that cows' hair has been\r\nused because feathers were not to be found; but when the nests are\r\nin the vicinity of a rookery, a farm-yard, or any other locality\r\nwhere feathers are abundant, the Wrens will use them exclusively.\r\nWhat the \"strong evidence\" must be which will convince Mr. Rennie\r\nabout cock-nests, I don't know; but I know of a dozen of these\r\nnests at the present moment, several of which have remained in the\r\nstate in which they were left in the middle of April. Other nests\r\nfound about the same time have now young ones in them. I doubt not\r\nthese nests are occasionally used for breeding in: for instance,\r\nif the first nest of a Wren be taken, or if it breed a second\r\ntime, it will occasionally take possession of a cock-nest; as I\r\nhave sometimes found that after remaining in the same unfinished\r\nstate for several weeks, they have afterwards been fitted up with\r\na lining, and bred in.\r\n\r\nMr. Rennie asserts that Montagu is wrong when he says that the\r\nWren always adapts its materials to its locality. Although it\r\ncertainly is not always the case, yet so very generally is it so,\r\nthat I think it is not surprising that Montagu made this\r\nassertion.\r\n\r\nThus, if a Wren build in a haystack, the front of the nest is\r\ngenerally composed of the hay from the stack; if it be built in a\r\nbush by the side of a river, and (which is frequently the case)\r\nbelow flood mark, it is generally covered on the outside with the\r\nrubbish which has been left there by the flood; and if it build in\r\na mossy stump, the front of the nest is composed of the dark-\r\ncoloured moss which grows there. (May 22, 1832.)\r\n\r\nAlong with my last letter, I sent some Wrens' nests lined with\r\nfeathers, and I could easily have increased them to a dozen of the\r\nsame sort, only I did not wish to deprive so many of my little\r\nfavourites of their eggs and young. Every day convinces me more\r\ndecidedly, that I am right both with regard to the lining of the\r\nWrens' nests, and as to the cock-nests also. The nests I sent you\r\nwill prove the former, and I know of at least twenty instances of\r\nthe latter, in nests which I have known of all through the spring,\r\nfrom April to the present time, which have remained in the same\r\nunfinished state, although they are not forsaken, as I have found\r\nthe birds in them, in several instances, when I have examined\r\nthem. I found one of these nests on the 10th of April, under a\r\nbank on the side of the river; and I examined it repeatedly\r\nthrough April and May, and always found it in the same state,\r\nalthough there was always a pair of Wrens about, and I could find\r\nno other nest; yet I am sure there was another, for in the\r\nbeginning of this month (June) there were some young Wrens, which\r\nhad evidently only just come out of the nest; and there were only\r\ntwo or three bushes grew thereabouts, so that it is not probable\r\nthey had come from any other quarter, but the bushes were filled\r\nwith dead leaves, and other rubbish brought down by the flood.\r\nHowever, when I heard them, I looked out for another nest, as I\r\nbelieve (notwithstanding what Montagu says, that there are few\r\nbirds, if any, that would produce a second lot of eggs if the\r\nfirst were unmolested) that most of the small birds which are\r\nearly breeders build a second time the same year, even when they\r\nsucceed in rearing the first brood. I have had proof of this (if\r\nanything can be considered proof, except marking the birds), in\r\nthe Throstle, the Blackbird, the Wren, the Redbreast, and the\r\nHedge Sparrow, whose second nests may be found contiguous to the\r\nfirst; and in point of time, this always happens just when the\r\nfirst brood have left the nest. The cock-bird, too, who had been\r\nsilent whilst his young were unfledged, begins to sing again, and\r\nthrowing off the anxious and care-beset manners of a parent, again\r\nassumes that of a bridegroom. But to return to Wrens' nests. I\r\nfound one within ten yards of the one I had known of since the\r\n10th of April, lined, and ready for an egg. As I was anxious to\r\nprove what I had so long believed, I pulled out this nest,\r\nthinking that the old bird was ready for laying a second lot of\r\neggs; and that when I had destroyed this, as she had no other nest\r\nready, she would probably take up with the cock-nest.\r\n\r\nAs it was half a mile from my house, I did not visit it again\r\nuntil the 16th of June, and was then delighted to find the old\r\nbird sitting on six or seven eggs in the cock-nest, which had\r\nremained so long unoccupied. I believe that in this instance there\r\nis very little lining (fur, feathers, &c.) in the nest, although I\r\nshould be sorry to examine it minutely until the young have left\r\nit; but I consider it an exception to the general rule, inasmuch\r\nas I believe the bird was ready to lay when I pulled out the other\r\nnest. As she would have to find another with as little delay as\r\npossible, she would not have time to embellish the inside in the\r\nsame manner as she probably would have done if she had had more\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nOn examining another Wrens' nest a few evenings ago, I found the\r\nyoung ones had flown, and as there was a cock-nest in some wrack\r\nleft by the river in a bush a few yards off, I gave it a shake to\r\nsee if the old ones had taken possession of it for another brood;\r\nand I was surprised to see one, and then a second young one come\r\nflying out, and a third putting out its head to reconnoitre.\r\nWhether the whole brood was there I don't know, as I did not\r\ndisturb them further. As I had examined this nest only ten days\r\nbefore, when it had not an egg in it, I was at first at a loss to\r\naccount for these young ones; but I have now no doubt they were\r\nthe young from the adjoining nest, which had taken up their\r\nquarters for the night in the new house. But how had they learnt\r\nthe way? Young birds generally roost where night finds them, and\r\nif I had found only one, I should not have been surprised, but to\r\nfind at least three, probably six or seven, in a nest where I am\r\ncertain they were not bred, was something new to me. I went\r\nseveral times in the evening after this, but never found them; I\r\nsuppose the fright I gave them deterred them from lodging there\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nThe editor of \"Loudon's Magazine,\" in a paragraph appended to this\r\narticle, says: \"We have examined the Wrens' nests sent; their\r\nstaple materials are moss, feathers, and hair. Into the moss on\r\nthe exterior of the nest are woven a more or less perfect but\r\nfeeble frond or two, and separate pinnae as well of Aspidium\r\nFilix-Mas, and leaves of apple, elm, and oak trees. Interiorly\r\ncows' hair is not scarce, and is partly inwoven with the moss and\r\nlaces it together, and partly mingled with the feathers; a horse-\r\nhair or two are also observable. The feathers in each nest,\r\napparently those of domestic fowls, are numerous enough to fill\r\nthe hollow of the hand when the fingers are so folded over as not\r\nto much compress the feathers.\"\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nALARM-NOTE OF ONE BIRD UNDERSTOOD BY OTHER SPECIES OF BIRDS.\r\n\r\nIn Montagu's \"Ornithological Dictionary,\" under the article \"Song\r\nof Birds,\" there is the following remark: \"Regarding the note of\r\nalarm which birds utter on the approach of their natural enemies,\r\nwhether a Hawk, an Owl, or a Cat, we consider it to be a general\r\nlanguage perfectly understood by all small birds, though each\r\nspecies has a note peculiar to itself.\" I was last April very much\r\npleased at witnessing an illustration of the truth of this\r\nopinion. I found a nest of young Throstles at the root of a hazel,\r\nand although they could scarcely fly, yet as they were near a\r\nfootpath, and the next day was Sunday, when many idle and\r\nmischievous lads would be rambling about, I thought they would be\r\nsafer out of their nest than in it; and as I knew that when so far\r\nfledged, if they were once disturbed they would not continue in\r\nthe nest, I took one from the nest and made it cry out, and then\r\nput it back again; but in one minute, not only it but its three\r\ncompanions had disappeared in the long dry grass which was round\r\nabout. On hearing the cry of their young one, the parent bird set\r\nup such shrieks of alarm as brought all the birds in the wood to\r\nsee what was the matter. I noticed the Blackbird, the Chaffinch,\r\nthe Titlark, the Robin, the Oxeye (greater Titmouse), the Blue and\r\nMarsh Titmouse, and the Wren all uttering their cries of alarm and\r\napprehension; even the golden-crested Wren, which usually seems to\r\ncare for nothing, was as forward and persevering as any of them in\r\nexpressing its fears on this occasion; indeed, the only bird which\r\nseemed indifferent to all these manifestations of alarm was the\r\nCreeper, which continued its anxious and incessant search for\r\nfood, as it flitted from one tree to another, examining them from\r\nroot to branch without ever seeming to understand or to care for\r\nwhat seemed to have so much frightened the others. (June 30th,\r\n1832.)\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nDATES OF THE APPEARANCE OF SOME SPRING BIRDS IN 1832, AT\r\nCLITHEROE.\r\n\r\nYoung Rooks heard, 5th April; House Martin seen, 14th; Sandpiper,\r\n14th; Willow Wren, Spring Wagtail, and Redstart, 17th; Wheatear,\r\n19th (this is generally the first spring bird seen); Sand Martin\r\nand Swallow, 22nd; Cuckoo heard, 26th; Wood Wren, Blackcap, and\r\nWhinchat, 28th; Mocking-bird and Whitethroat, 4th May; Swift, 7th;\r\nFlycatcher, 11th; and Fieldfares were not seen until the 2nd of\r\nMay, which is later than I ever observed them before. (In the\r\nparish of Allesby, near Coventry, Fieldfares were observed as late\r\nas the 14th of May.)\r\n\r\nNo doubt many of these birds were in the neighbourhood earlier\r\nthan the dates I have attached to them, but they are the periods\r\nat which I saw or heard them.\r\n\r\nThe study of Natural History is perhaps as little followed in this\r\nneighbourhood as in any part of the kingdom, notwithstanding the\r\nfacilities which are offered. Our flora is beautiful, varied, and\r\npossesses many rare plants, yet I only know of two herbaria; the\r\nbirds are abundant, yet there is but one collector of them; and as\r\nfor insects, although I frequently take what I consider rare\r\nspecies, yet I cannot find an entomologist in the whole district,\r\nor I would send them to him.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, allow me to say, that the leisure hours a somewhat\r\nbusy life has enabled me to spend in these pursuits, have been\r\nsome of the happiest of my existence, and have awakened and\r\ncherished such an admiration of nature and such a love for the\r\ncountry and its scenes, as I think can never be appreciated by the\r\ninhabitants of large towns, and which I cannot describe so well as\r\nin the words of one of my friends in a beautiful apostrophe to\r\nEngland, when leaving it--never to return: [11]--\r\n\r\n\"To thee Whose fields first fed my childish fantasy, Whose\r\nmountains were my boyhood's wild delight, Whose rocks, and woods,\r\nand torrents were to me The food of my soul's youthful appetite;\r\nWere music to my ear--a blessing to my sight.\"\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nTHE ROOK SERVICEABLE TO MAN.--PREJUDICE AGAINST IT.\r\n\r\nA strong prejudice is felt by many persons against Rooks, on\r\naccount of their destroying grain and potatoes, and so far is this\r\nprejudice carried, that I know persons who offer a reward for\r\nevery Rook that is killed on their land; yet so mistaken do I deem\r\nthem as to consider that no living creature is so serviceable to\r\nthe farmer as the Rook, except his own live stock.\r\n\r\nIn the neighbourhood of my native place is a rookery belonging to\r\nWilliam Vavasour Esq., of Weston in Wharfdale, in which it is\r\nestimated there are 10,000 Rooks, that 1 lb. of food a week is a\r\nvery moderate allowance for each bird, and that nine-tenths of\r\nsuch food consists of worms, insects, and their larvae: for\r\nalthough they do considerable damage to the crops for a few weeks\r\nin seed-time and harvest, particularly in backward seasons, yet a\r\nvery large proportion of their food, even at these times, consists\r\nof insects and worms, which (if we except a few acorns, walnuts,\r\nand potatoes in autumn) at all other times form the whole of their\r\nsubsistence.\r\n\r\nHere, then, if my data be correct, there is the enormous quantity\r\nof 468,000 lbs., or 209 tons of worms, insects, and their larvae\r\ndestroyed by the birds of a single rookery, and to everyone who\r\nknows how very destructive to vegetation are the larvae of the\r\ntribes of insects (as well as worms) fed upon by Rooks, some\r\nslight idea may be formed of the devastation which Rooks are the\r\nmeans of preventing. I have understood that in Suffolk and in some\r\nof the southern counties, the larvae of the cockchafer are so\r\nexceedingly abundant that the crops of corn are almost destroyed\r\nby them, and that their ravages do not cease even when they have\r\nbecome perfect insects. Various plans have been proposed to put a\r\nstop to their ravages, but I have little doubt that their\r\nabundance is to be attributed to the scarcity of Rooks, as I have\r\nsomewhere seen an account that these birds are not numerous in\r\nthose counties (I have never been there), either from the trees\r\nbeing felled in which they nested, or from their having been\r\ndestroyed by the prejudiced farmer. I am the more inclined to be\r\nof this opinion, because we have many Rooks in this neighbourhood\r\nwhere the cockchafer is not known as a destructive insect, and I\r\nknow that insects of that class and their larvae are the most\r\nfavourite food of the Rook, which may be seen in the twilight\r\ncatching both cockchafers and the large blackbeetles which are\r\nflying at that time in the evening.\r\n\r\nI will mention another instance of the utility of the Rook which\r\noccurred in this neighbourhood. Many years ago a flight of locusts\r\nvisited Craven, and they were so numerous as to create considerable\r\nalarm among the farmers of the district. They were, however, soon\r\nrelieved from their anxiety, for the Rooks flocked in from all\r\nquarters by thousands and tens of thousands, and devoured the\r\nlocusts so greedily that they were all destroyed in a short time.\r\nSuch, at least, is the account given, and I have heard it repeatedly\r\nmentioned as the reason why the late Lord Ribblesdale was so partial\r\nto Rooks. But I have no means of ascertaining how far this is true.\r\n\r\nIt was stated in the newspapers a year or two back that there was\r\nsuch an enormous quantity of caterpillars upon Skiddaw, that they\r\ndevoured all the vegetation on the mountain, and people were\r\napprehensive they would attack the crops in the enclosed lands;\r\nbut the Rooks (which are fond of high ground in the summer) having\r\ndiscovered them, put a stop to their ravages in a very short time.\r\n(June 30th, 1832.)\r\n\r\nThese remarks are confirmed by a writer in the \"Essex Herald\" and\r\nby Mr. Waterton. The former says:--\"An extensive experiment\r\nappears to have been made in some of the agricultural districts on\r\nthe Continent, the result of which has been the opinion that\r\nfarmers do wrong in destroying Rooks, Jays, Sparrows, and, indeed,\r\nbirds in general on their farms, particularly where there are\r\norchards.\"\r\n\r\nThat birds do mischief occasionally among ripe corn there can be\r\nno doubt; but the harm they do in autumn is amply compensated by\r\nthe good they do in spring by the havoc they make among the insect\r\ntribes. The quantity of grubs destroyed by Rooks and of\r\ncaterpillars and grubs by the various small birds, must be\r\nannually immense. Other tribes of birds which feed on the wing--as\r\nSwifts, Swallows, and Martins--destroy millions of winged insects\r\nwhich would otherwise infest the air and become insupportably\r\ntroublesome. Even the Titmouse and the Bullfinch, usually supposed\r\nto be so mischievous in gardens, have actually been proved only to\r\ndestroy those buds which contain a destructive insect. Ornithologists\r\nhave of late determined these facts to be true, and parish officers\r\nwould do well to consider them before they waste the public money\r\nin paying rewards to idle boys and girls for the heads of dead birds,\r\nwhich only encourages children and other idle persons in the\r\nmischievous employment of fowling instead of minding their work or\r\ntheir schooling. But to return to the experiment alluded to. On some\r\nvery large farms in Devonshire the proprietors determined a few\r\nsummers ago to try the result of offering a great reward for the\r\nheads of Rooks, but the issue proved destructive to the farms, for\r\nnearly the whole of the crops failed for three succeeding years, and\r\nthey have since been forced to import Rooks and other birds wherewith\r\nto re-stock their farms.\r\n\r\nOf late years the extensive destruction of the foliage and young\r\nfruit in orchards by a species of caterpillar has excited the\r\nattention of the naturalist, and it has been found to have arisen\r\nfrom the habit of destroying those small birds about orchards\r\nwhich if left unmolested would have destroyed or kept down those\r\nrapacious insects.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nSANDPIPERS.\r\n\r\nSandpipers breed about Clitheroe. I this year (1832) started an\r\nold one from her nest at the root of a Weymouth pine. She screamed\r\nout, and rolled about in such a manner, and seemed so completely\r\ndisabled, that, although perfectly aware that her intention was to\r\nallure me from her nest, I could not resist my inclination to\r\npursue her, and in consequence I had great difficulty in finding\r\nthe nest again. It was built of a few dried leaves of the Weymouth\r\npine, and contained three young ones just hatched, and an egg\r\nthrough which the bill of a young one was making its way. Yet,\r\nyoung as they were, on my taking out the egg to examine it, the\r\nlittle things, which could not have been out of the shell more\r\nthan an hour or two, set off out of the nest with as much celerity\r\nas if they had been running about a fortnight. As I thought the\r\nold one would abandon the egg if the young ones left the nest, I\r\ncaught them again and covering them up with my hand for some time,\r\nthey settled down again. Next day all four had disappeared.\r\n\r\nMontagu says: \"It is probable many of the Sandpipers are capable\r\nof swimming if by accident they wade out of their depth. Having\r\nshot and winged one of this species as it was flying across a\r\npiece of water, it fell, and floated towards the side, and as we\r\nreached to take it up, the bird instantly dived, and we never saw\r\nit rise again to the surface; possibly it got entangled in the\r\nweeds and was drowned.\" I quote this remark because the same thing\r\nhas happened to myself. I winged a Sandpiper, and on going to take\r\nit up, it fluttered into the water and dived, but never rose again\r\nto the surface that I could perceive, although I watched long and\r\nattentively for it. In this instance the bird could not have been\r\nentangled by the weeds, inasmuch as the bottom of the river was\r\ncovered with gravel and not a weed was growing there. Whether the\r\nSandpiper laid hold of the gravel at the bottom with its feet, or\r\nhow it managed, I cannot tell, nor have I ever been able to\r\naccount for it. (June 30th, 1832.)\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nON BIRDS DRESSING THEIR FEATHERS WITH OIL FROM A GLAND.\r\n\r\nMr. Waterton doubts (\"Mag. of Nat. History,\" vol. v. p. 413) if\r\nthe small nipple on the rump of birds is an oil-gland, or that\r\nbirds ever oil their feathers with matter obtained from it; and he\r\nasks if any naturalist will say that he has ever witnessed this\r\nprocess, and if so how it is that the bird contrives to take this\r\noil in its bill and how it manages to oil its head and neck? I\r\nwill therefore state what I think I have witnessed, and trust to\r\nMr. Waterton's forbearance if I am in error; yet I cannot help\r\nsuspecting that Mr. Waterton's queries are (like those of Charles\r\nthe Second to the Royal Society) more for the purpose of laughing\r\nat our ignorance than from any wish he has to obtain information,\r\nfor I can scarcely suppose that so acute an observer can have\r\nfailed to perceive everything perceptible on the point at issue.\r\n\r\nI have just watched a Muscovy Duck go through the operation of\r\npreening and dressing its feathers, and it certainly appears\r\nobvious enough to me that this bird uses the gland on the rump for\r\nthe purpose for which birds are generally supposed to use it. The\r\nbird erected the feathers on the rump so as to exhibit the gland\r\nvery distinctly, and then, after pressing it with the bill, rubbed\r\nthe under mandible and chin down to the throat upon it, and then,\r\nafter drawing some of the feathers through the bill, rubbed the\r\nlower mandible and chin upon the back and scapulars, apparently to\r\napply the oil which adhered to them, and then, turning its head\r\nback, it rubbed the crown and sides of the head and neck upon\r\nthose parts which it had previously rubbed with the chin and under\r\nmandible. By this rubbing of the head and neck it is easy to\r\nperceive how birds can oil these parts if it be allowed that birds\r\noil themselves at all.\r\n\r\nI cannot see how we can explain this action of birds in relation\r\nto any other object. It certainly does not seem calculated to\r\nexpel or disturb any vermin lodged there, and I remarked that it\r\nnever occurred except when the bird had been applying its bill to\r\nthe gland as above mentioned. However, Mr. Waterton, and anyone\r\nwho doubts this oiling, may readily judge for themselves. Let them\r\ntake a common duck, and shut it up for two or three days, so that\r\nit can have no access to water except for drinking, and at the end\r\nof that time let them turn it out, and allow it to go to a brook\r\nor pond; it will give itself a thorough ablution--ducking, diving,\r\nand splashing with its wings--and on coming out, will begin to\r\ndress and arrange its feathers, very frequently applying its bill\r\nto the gland on its rump. If this application is not for the\r\npurpose of procuring a supply of oil, perhaps Mr. Waterton will\r\nhave the goodness to inform us what it is for, and what end this\r\ngland answers in the economy of the feathered tribes if not that\r\nwhich has hitherto been supposed. (June 30, 1832.)\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nMOCKING POWERS OF THE SEDGE-WARBLER.\r\n\r\nIn the article \"Sedge Bird,\" in Montagu's \"Dictionary of\r\nOrnithology\" (Rennie's edition, p. 455), the writer says: \"It has\r\na variety of notes, which partake of those of the Skylark and the\r\nSwallow, as well as the chatter of the House-Sparrow.\" According\r\nto my observation, it has a much greater variety than this. I have\r\nheard it imitate in succession (intermixed with its own note,\r\n_chur, chur_), the Swallow, the House-Martin, the Greenfinch, the\r\nChaffinch, the Lesser-Redpole, the House-Sparrow, the Redstart,\r\nthe Willow-Wren, the Whinchat, the Pied-Wagtail, and the Spring-\r\nWagtail; yet its imitations are chiefly confined to the notes of\r\nalarm (the fretting-notes as they are called here) of those birds,\r\nand so exactly does it imitate them in tone and modulation, that\r\nif it were to confine itself to one (no matter which), and not\r\ninterlard the wailings of the little Redpole and the shrieks of\r\nthe Martin with the _curses_ of the House-Sparrow, the _twink,\r\ntwink_ of the Chaffinch, and its own _care-for-naught_ chatters,\r\nthe most practiced ear would not detect the difference. After\r\nbeing silent for awhile, it often begins with the _chue, chue_ of\r\nthe House-Sparrow, so exactly imitated in every respect that were\r\nit not for what follows, no one would suppose it to be any other\r\nbird. It is called a Mocking-Bird here, and it well deserves the\r\nname, for it is a real scoffer at the sorrows of other birds,\r\nwhich it laughs to scorn and turns into ridicule by parodying them\r\nso exactly. I never heard it attempt to imitate any of the Larks\r\nor Thrushes, although I have listened to it for hours.\r\n\r\nThis bird was very plentifully met with in Wharfdale ten years\r\nago, and is also found in this neighbourhood, but I am not aware\r\nthat anybody in either of these districts ever attempted to keep\r\none in confinement, although from their powers of imitation, I\r\nthink the experiment well worth trying; probably the idea that it\r\nwould be difficult to supply them with proper food has prevented\r\nthe experiment being made. (May 2nd, 1832.)\r\n\r\nI am surprised that no other writer on Natural History has noticed\r\nthe wonderful imitative power of this bird. So far is the above\r\nnotice from overstating this bird's powers of imitation, that I\r\nhave scarcely enumerated half the notes which it hits off with\r\nsuch wonderful exactness.\r\n\r\nIn listening to one the other day for about a quarter of an hour,\r\nI heard it give three notes of the Swallow, two of the Martin, and\r\ntwo of the Spring-Wagtail; and in addition, notes of the House-\r\nSparrow, Whinchat, Starling, Chaffinch, Whitethroat, Greenfinch,\r\nLittle Redpole, and Whin-Linnet, besides the notes of half-a-dozen\r\nbirds which I did not know; at least, a reasoning from analogy\r\nwould induce me to think them imitations, and I have no right to\r\nsuppose they were not because I did not happen to recognize them.\r\nI am not strictly correct when I say that it only imitates the\r\nalarm-notes (called here fretting-notes) of other birds, for\r\nalthough this is generally the case, it is not invariably so. For\r\ninstance, in addition to the alarm-note of the Swallow, _chizzic,\r\nchizzic_, it also had the _whit, whit_, which the Swallow uses\r\nwhen flying about, and the chatter of self-satisfaction (not the\r\nsong) which one often hears in a barn when two Swallows are\r\narranging their plan of operations in the spring. Again, in\r\naddition to the shriek of the Martin, there was the note which it\r\nutters when on the wing in pursuit of its food. There was also the\r\nchirrup of the Greenfinch, and the _whee, whee, whee_ which is the\r\nclimax of the Linnet's song, by which it is so irresistible as a\r\ncall-bird, and which appears to bring down the flock in spite of\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Sedge-Bird imitated all I have mentioned, it made\r\nmuch more frequent use of the notes of some than of others--the\r\nSparrow, the Whinchat, the Swallow, and the Starling appeared to\r\nbe its chief favourites, whilst it only touched once or twice on\r\nthe notes of the Greenfinch and the Linnet. It had been very\r\nsparing also in its use of the Chaffinch's note, until one in the\r\nneighbourhood had begun to _twink, twink, twink_; then the\r\nMocking-Bird took it up, and _twinked_ away for fifty times\r\ntogether. Next morning the Linnet's note was much more frequent in\r\nrequest, and it also made more use of notes with which I was not\r\nacquainted. On neither day did it touch upon the notes of the\r\nRedstart, or Pied-Wagtail, both of which I had heard frequently\r\nused by the Mocking-Bird before. On the other hand, I had not\r\npreviously observed the notes of the Starling and Whin-Linnet, and\r\ntherefore, although I have said that I have never heard it make\r\nuse of the notes of any of the Larks or the Thrushes, I would not\r\nbe understood to say that this never happens. It is, perhaps,\r\ndifficult to say whether it has a note which is not an imitation\r\nof some other bird, but there is one which it always makes use of\r\nwhen any person approaches its nest (intermixed, however, with the\r\nnotes of the Swallow, Whinchat, and Whitethroat). This is\r\nsomething like _chur-r-r, chur-r-r_, prolonging the sound of the\r\n_r_ very considerably, and in a style which would be quite an\r\nacquisition to the Northumbrians if they could attain it. (May\r\n29th, 1834.)\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nTHE WATER OUZEL.\r\n\r\nThe Water Ouzel sings very frequently, and as much in winter as at\r\nany time. Perched on a stone or a piece of ice, it chirps away at\r\na famous rate, but its song consists almost entirely of its note\r\n_zeet, zeet_, which it hashes up in all sorts of ways, lengthening\r\nand shortening--now a crotchet, then a semiquaver, rising an\r\noctave or so, and then descending again. It makes as much of it as\r\ncan be made, but with all its efforts its song is a very _so-so_\r\naffair, all its syllables beginning with _z_, and almost ending\r\nwith it too. Yet, although it is not much of a songster, it is\r\nalmost a sacred bird with me, in consequence of the associations\r\nconnected with it. A pair had built for forty years, according to\r\ntradition, in a wheel-race near to where I was born, and had never\r\nbeen molested by anybody until a gentleman in the neighbourhood,\r\nwho was a great ornithologist, employed his gamekeeper to shoot\r\nthis pair. I think the natives of Calcutta were not more indignant\r\nwhen an unlucky Englishman got one of their sacred bulls into his\r\ncompound and baited him, than was our little community at what we\r\nconsidered so great an outrage. The gamekeeper narrowly escaped\r\nbeing stoned by myself and some more lads, any one of whom would\r\nhave shot fifty Blackbirds or Fieldfares without any misgivings.\r\n\r\nThis bird very much resembles the Wren in its habits and motions,\r\nits nods and curtsies, and cocks its tail in exactly the same\r\nmanner. Its nest is also similar in form to that of the Wren.\r\n\r\nSome persons seem to think that it is impossible for the Water\r\nOuzel to walk at the bottom of the water, owing to its body being\r\nof less specific gravity. I will not argue the point with them,\r\nbut disbelieving my own eyes, I will endeavour to submit with a\r\ngood grace; otherwise I should have said that I have repeatedly\r\nseen it doing so, from a situation where I had an excellent\r\nopportunity of observing it, the window of a building directly\r\nover the place where it was feeding. It walked into the water and\r\nbegan to turn over the pebbles with its bill, rooting almost like\r\na pig, and it seemed to have no difficulty whatever in keeping at\r\nthe bottom at all depths where I could see it; and I have\r\nfrequently observed it when the water just covered it, and its\r\nhead appeared above the water every time it lifted it up, which it\r\ndid incessantly, turning over a pebble or two, then lifting its\r\nhead, and again dipping it below to seize the creepers (_aquatic\r\nlarvae_) it had disturbed from their hiding-places. Besides, its\r\nspeed was too slow for diving. Every aquatic bird with which I am\r\nacquainted moves much faster when diving than when it is swimming\r\nor walking, and its course is generally in a straight line, or\r\nnearly so; but the Water Ouzel, when feeding, turns to the right\r\nor left, or back again to where it started, stops and goes on\r\nagain, just as it does when out of the water. Yet when it wished,\r\nit seemed to have the power of altering its own gravity, as after\r\nwading about two, or perhaps five minutes, where it could just get\r\nits head out, it would suddenly rise to the surface and begin to\r\nswim, which it does quite as well as the Water-hen. The awkward,\r\ntumbling, shuffling wriggle which it appears to have, is\r\noccasioned by the incessant motion of its head as it turns over\r\nthe gravel in search of creepers, which appear to me to form the\r\nbulk of its food.\r\n\r\nSir George Mackenzie seems to think that these birds destroy\r\nsalmon spawn, and this opinion is prevalent in Scotland. If it is\r\ncorrect, it would go far towards putting an end to my partiality\r\nfor them; but I rather think that they are unjustly accused, and\r\nbelieve they are catching creepers when they are supposed to be\r\neating spawn. If this is the fact (and it is well worth\r\nascertaining) they are rendering an essential service to the\r\nfisheries instead of injuring them, because these creepers (the\r\nlarvae of the stone-fly, bank-fly, and all the drakes) are\r\nexceedingly destructive to spawning-beds, and as the Water Ouzel\r\nfeeds on them at all other times, and as they are more abundant in\r\nthe winter than at any other season, I think this is the more\r\nprobable supposition. Of course, if Sir George Mackenzie has shot\r\nthe bird, and speaks from his own knowledge, after dissecting it,\r\nthere can be no doubt of the fact that it destroys spawn; but if\r\nhe merely supposes so because the Water Ouzel feeds in the same\r\nstreams where the salmon are spawning, it is very probable he is\r\nmistaken, for the reasons before mentioned. (May 29th, 1834).\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nSCOLOPAX, SABINES, SABINE'S-SNIPE.\r\n\r\nSome years ago I killed what I am now persuaded was a Sabine's-\r\nSnipe, but unfortunately it was not preserved, for hanging it up\r\nin the larder with the other birds I had killed, I found to my\r\ngreat mortification that the cook had stripped it of every feather\r\nbefore I was aware, and before I had noted down the markings of\r\nthe plumage.\r\n\r\nThe dry weather of August, 1820, had driven a flock of the Golden\r\nPlover from the moors to the banks of the river Wharfe, and on the\r\n14th of that month I had been out with my gun, endeavouring to\r\nshoot some of them. On my return I sprung this Snipe from a pond\r\nnear home, and killed it. When I picked it up, I was astonished to\r\nfind a Snipe with the plumage of a Woodcock, and showed it to a\r\nfriend of mine, who is a good practical ornithologist, but he was\r\nas much puzzled as myself to give it a name; so not being able to\r\nfind a description of it in any books to which we had access, we\r\njumped to the conclusion that it was a hybrid between the Snipe\r\nand the Woodcock, and called it a bastard Woodcock.\r\n\r\nAccording to the recollection I have of it, it was as large as the\r\nsolitary Snipe, and the bill was a little longer; the general\r\nappearance of the plumage on the wings and back resembled a dark-\r\ncoloured Woodcock; but under the wings the fine blue inner coverts\r\nexactly resembled those of the Snipe. In those days I had no idea\r\nof the value attached to rare birds, nor did I know anything of\r\nthe art of preserving birds, or of bird-preservers, and no doubt\r\nsome of these gentlemen will pronounce me a great Goth when I tell\r\nthem that what I regretted most, when I found that the bird was\r\nplucked, was the loss of the wings, the feathers of which I wanted\r\nto dress artificial flies with. Three days after I had killed\r\nthis, I saw another in a ditch adjoining Sir Henry Ibbetson's\r\npark, at Denton, but being in his preserve I had no opportunity of\r\nprocuring it. I had never seen one since, and until I had seen the\r\nsixth edition of Bewick's \"Birds,\" I was unable to make out its\r\nname, about which I may still be mistaken. (May 29th, 1834.)\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nFISH AND OTHER RIVER PHENOMENA.\r\n\r\nA writer in the \"British Naturalist\" says, that \"fish don't feed,\r\nand therefore we may conclude they don't discern in sunny\r\nweather.\" If the author had ever been a May-fly-fisher he would\r\nhave known that bright weather and clear water were essentially\r\nnecessary to his success.\r\n\r\nThis fly is one of the best baits I know for large Trout, and is\r\nmuch used by the anglers in some of the rivers in Yorkshire\r\n(perhaps in other counties also), where two methods of fishing it\r\nare practised. The one is bobbing, which with one sort of bait or\r\nanother is universal, and therefore needs no description. However,\r\nit is always practised in bright weather. In the other method\r\n(which I believe is peculiar to the North of England) the May-fly\r\n(stone-fly) is fished with a long line in rapid streams, in the\r\nsame way as the artificial fly, except that it is fished up the\r\nstream; that is, the angler throws his line into the stream above\r\nwhere he stands, and allows it to float down opposite to him, when\r\nhe makes another throw; by this means he always keeps his line\r\nslack, and the May-fly floats on the surface, which is essential\r\nto his success. I mention these two methods of angling because\r\nboth are practised in bright weather, and therefore prove that\r\nfish both discern and feed in such days. I believe the fact is,\r\nthat at such times they frequently see too well for the angler,\r\nand are consequently aware that his artificial flies are not what\r\nthey seem to be. Fishes, particularly Par and Grayling, may be\r\nseen rising by dozens at the small flies (midges) which abound in\r\nsunny weather, yet the angler is unable to hook a single fish.\r\nFirst-rate anglers are well aware of this, and abandon their\r\nlarger flies as the summer advances, use smaller hooks, dress\r\ntheir flies much finer, and substitute horsehair for the fishing-\r\ngut, when they can procure it of good quality.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nLAMPREYS.\r\n\r\nLampreys abound in the Ribble. Some of them, of the large species\r\n(_Petromyzon marinus_), weigh three and four pounds each, [12] but\r\nowing to a prejudice against them (I suppose on account of their\r\nugliness) they are seldom eaten. I will illustrate this prejudice\r\nby giving the remark of a keen fisherman to myself, on my saying\r\nthat I should eat a large one I had just caught. \"Well,\" said he,\r\n\"if you can manage to eat such a thing as that, you would not\r\nstick at devouring a child in the small-pox.\" This, if not an\r\nelegant, was at least a forcible expression of his opinion on the\r\nsubject, and this dislike of them is almost universal in this\r\nneighbourhood. (Jan. 17th 1832.)\r\n\r\n\"An Old Angler,\" in the \"Magazine of Natural History,\" having\r\nquestioned the assertion of Sir Everard Home that the Lamprey was\r\nhermaphrodite--in fact, that all were spawners and emitted eggs--\r\nthe following was addressed to the \"Magazine of Natural History\":--\r\n\r\nWhen I had the pleasure of writing to you before, I had either\r\noverlooked or forgotten the queries of \"An Old Angler\" respecting\r\nthe Lamprey. However, your remarks have induced me to pay a little\r\nmore attention to the subject. I can now confirm in the strongest\r\nand most conclusive manner the supposition of \"An Old Angler\" that\r\nthe sexes are as distinct in the Lamprey as they are in the Cod or\r\nHerring. How so distinguished an anatomist as Sir Everard Home\r\nfell into such a mistake, it is not for me to say; but I am as\r\ncertain that the sexes are distinct in the Lamprey as that they\r\nare so in any other animal, and I will now give my reasons for\r\nmaking this positive assertion.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of May, chancing to cross a small stream, I saw a\r\nnumber of Lampreys in the act of spawning, and remembering the\r\nqueries of your correspondent, I stood to watch their motions.\r\nAfter observing them for some time, I observed one twist its tail\r\nround another in such a manner, and they both stirred up the sand\r\nand small gravel from the bottom in such a way, as convinced me it\r\nwas a conjunction of the sexes. However, there were so many of\r\nthem together, and they kept so continually moving about, that I\r\ncould not single out the two individuals, and thus ascertain\r\nwhether they were male and female; but I felt so desirous of being\r\nable to set this question at rest, that I went again next morning,\r\nand was fortunate enough to find only two, a male and a female. I\r\nthen witnessed several sexual conjunctions, during which the sand\r\nand small gravel was stirred up by them, and each of which was\r\nfollowed by the ejection of a jet of eggs from the female. I then\r\ncaught them both, and dissected them. The sexual organ in the male\r\nwas projected above a quarter of an inch, and the body filled with\r\nmilt; the female, although she seemed to have shed a considerable\r\nquantity of her spawn, had still a tolerable stock remaining.\r\n\r\nI frequently afterwards witnessed the same thing, and always found\r\nthe same difference of sexes; in fact, there was generally no\r\ndifficulty in distinguishing the male from the female, without\r\ntaking them out of the water: the latter might be readily known by\r\nthe enlargement of her body, and the former by a still more\r\nincontestable token. I have been induced to describe this more\r\nminutely than I otherwise should have done, in consequence of the\r\nmystery in which the propagation of fish has been wrapped\r\nhitherto; and I am not aware that what I have described has been\r\nwitnessed by anyone before--at least I don't know that it has been\r\nrecorded.\r\n\r\nI caught half-a-dozen Lampreys, four males and two females, and\r\npreserved them in spirits, and these I now forward to you.\r\n\r\nI am unable to give the same information concerning the large\r\nLamprey, having never seen it in the act of spawning; but I have\r\nrepeatedly caught both milters and spawners of species with the\r\nmilt and roe as distinctly visible in them as it is in the Salmon\r\nor any other fish.\r\n\r\nI am of opinion that the _P. marinus_ and the _P. fluviatilis_ are\r\ndistinct species, for the following reasons:--1st. Because the\r\nlatter stays with us the whole year, while the former only ascends\r\nthe rivers to spawn, and then returns to the sea immediately. 2nd.\r\nBecause fish that are in the habit of descending to the sea, never\r\n(unless the small Lamprey be an exception to the general rule)\r\narrive at maturity [13] until they have visited it; and, 3rdly,\r\nbecause there are no intermediate sizes (at least in the Ribble)\r\nbetween the one which, although only six or seven inches long, and\r\nan ounce in weight, is yet capable of propagation, and the one of\r\na pound. Not having one of the larger kind to refer to, I am\r\nunable to point out any specific difference of form. (May 2nd,\r\n1832.)\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nON THE SPAWNING OF THE MINNOW.\r\n\r\nAs I had been so fortunate in observing the Lampreys, I felt\r\ndesirous of ascertaining whether the same thing could be seen in\r\nother fish (as in Natural History it is not always safe to reason\r\nfrom analogy), and as there was a large shoal of Minnows spawning\r\nnear the place where I had seen the Lampreys, I determined to\r\nwatch their motions. They happened to have chosen a very\r\nconvenient place for being observed, being between two large\r\nstones in the river, which lay about three feet from each other;\r\nso that by cautiously approaching them from behind one of the\r\nstones, I got close to without disturbing them, but after watching\r\nthem carefully and repeatedly within the distance of two feet, I\r\ncan only speak doubtfully of their operations, for they were so\r\nnumerous, and their motions were so incessant; and when a female\r\nwas about to shed her spawn, the males (which were ten times more\r\nnumerous than the females) crowded round her in such a manner as\r\nto render it very difficult, if not impossible, to speak with\r\ncertainty on the subject. I will state what steps I took to\r\nsatisfy myself, and perhaps the history of my failure may be of\r\nuse to future observers.\r\n\r\nIt occurred to me from what I observed, that it was probable the\r\nmales had the power of absorbing the eggs after their exclusion by\r\nthe female, and impregnating them within their own bodies; and I\r\ncaught a dozen males at different times, when they were attending\r\non females, and opened them, but I could discover nothing like an\r\negg. I then caught a female, and scattered the spawn (which was\r\nexpelled by the slightest pressure) in a place frequented by a\r\nnumber of males, but they took no notice of it whatever. I after\r\nthis caught a female when she was surrounded by a number of males,\r\nand apparently in the act of shedding her spawn, and examined\r\nwhether the spawn which I pressed from her body was impregnated;\r\nbut it appeared perfectly homogeneous, and so delicate in its\r\ntexture that it burst with the slightest touch, whilst in that\r\nwhich I picked up from among the gravel where it was scattered\r\nabundantly, the impregnation was visible with the assistance of a\r\nmicroscope, and it was so much tougher in its covering as to bear\r\nrolling about in my hand without injury. I then tried to\r\nimpregnate the eggs _mechanically_, and applied a drop of the\r\nspermatic fluid to the egg at the moment of exclusion, and it\r\ncertainly seemed, in one instance, both to increase the size and\r\nto alter the colour of the ova it was applied to; but I was not\r\nable to produce the same effect so decidedly in any of my\r\nsubsequent attempts.\r\n\r\nMy observations, which were often repeated, induce me to believe\r\nthat the egg is impregnated at the moment of exclusion, and that\r\ntwo males have (almost invariably) access to the female at the\r\nsame time; for I frequently remarked, that when a female came\r\namong a number of males, they immediately pursued her: if she was\r\nnot ready for shedding her spawn, she made a precipitate retreat;\r\nbut if she was, she came boldly in among them, and was immediately\r\npressed closely by a male on each side, who when they had been in\r\nthat situation a short time, were superseded by other two, who\r\nwedged themselves in between them and the female, who appeared to\r\ntreat all her lovers with the same kindness.\r\n\r\nOne difficulty is, that the spermatic fluid mixes very readily\r\nwith water; and I cannot imagine how its virtue is preserved, [14]\r\nif (as I suppose must be the case) the egg is impregnated after\r\nexclusion; but I also think it probable that the ventral fins of\r\nthe female serve to conduct this fluid to the place where it is\r\nneeded, and the chemical affinity between it and the egg may be\r\nsufficient for impregnation.\r\n\r\nP.S. July 27th. I tried to hatch some of the eggs I had\r\nendeavoured to fecundate. The attempt was unsuccessful. I placed\r\nthe eggs, which I had put into some clean-washed gravel, in a\r\nshallow vessel (open at the top, and with holes drilled through\r\nthe sides) in a small stream of water, but I found to my great\r\nmortification on looking for them a day or two after that there\r\nwas not one left, but that in their stead were many aquatic\r\ninsects, which had no doubt feasted on them as long as they\r\nlasted, and after this I was not able to meet with another shoal\r\nof Minnows in the act of spawning.\r\n\r\nThe head of the Minnow in the spawning season is spotted over with\r\nsmall white knobs, apparently osseous in their structure, which\r\nmake their appearance immediately before the fish begins to spawn,\r\nand which disappear again as shortly after, and I think they are\r\nintended as a protection to the head of the fish during the\r\nspawning; as I remarked that they generally thrust their heads in\r\nbetween two pebbles, and had their tails sticking up almost\r\nperpendicularly. Yet this was not always the case, as they\r\nsometimes ran nearly out of the water, and it was in this\r\nsituation that I observed what I have before mentioned, as I found\r\nit impossible to discover anything that was done by those in\r\ndeeper water; for when a female went into such a situation, there\r\nwas such a crowd of males rushed to the place that I lost sight of\r\nher in a moment.\r\n\r\nI was astonished to find how quickly the eggs were hatched. I\r\ndiscovered a large shoal spawning on the 11th of May; on the 12th\r\nthey were diminished to one-tenth of the number, and on the 14th\r\n(the 13th being Sunday) there was not one left. As I had by no\r\nmeans satisfied myself on the subject, I felt disappointed that\r\nthey had so soon finished their operations, and I took up a\r\nhandful of the gravel where they had been spawning, and examined\r\nit with the microscope, to see whether I could discover any ova,\r\nand how they were going on, when to my great surprise I found them\r\nalready hatching and some of them already excluded from the egg.\r\nOne of them, which I took on the point of a knife, swam briskly\r\naway, and another was the means of pointing out an enemy to me\r\nwhich I had not previously suspected, and that I had always\r\nhitherto believed to be the prey of and not the preyer upon fish.\r\nThe poor Minnow had somehow got fast to the point of the knife,\r\nand in its struggles to free itself it attracted the attention of\r\na creeper--the larva of one of the aquatic flies called drakes\r\n(_Ephemerae_)--which pounced upon it as fiercely as the water\r\nstaphylinus does on the luckless tadpole, but, fortunately for the\r\nMinnow, either the glittering of the knife-blade or the motion of\r\nmy hand, scared it away again without its prey.\r\n\r\nThe young Minnows in this state were quite transparent, except the\r\neyes, which were disproportionately large; and they seemed to be\r\nperfectly aware that they owed their safety to concealment, as\r\nthose that I saw immediately buried themselves in the gravel when\r\nthey were set at liberty. (July 27th, 1832.)\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nEELS.\r\n\r\nTo the Editor of the \"Gardener's Chronicle.\"\r\n\r\nMy attention has been called to a paragraph in a Worcester paper\r\ngiving an account of a (so-called) discovery by Mr. Boccius, that\r\nEels are propagated by spawn, like other fish, and that they are\r\nnot brought forth alive, as had hitherto been supposed. This may\r\nbe true, but before I can give an unqualified belief to the\r\nassertion, I should like to have a few questions answered by Mr.\r\nBoccius. Who saw the fish from which those thousands of eggs were\r\nextracted at the time this dissection was made? Are the parties\r\nwho saw these eggs quite certain that the fish was an Eel and not\r\na Lamprey? Who saw the eggs from which Mr. Boccius produced living\r\nEels? Who beside Mr. Boccius ever saw Eel-fry in a pond which had\r\nno communication with a river? Will Mr. Allees and Mr. Reed (the\r\ngentlemen to whom the spawn was exhibited) say whether the ovary\r\nwhich was shown to them was pretty much of the same form as that\r\nof the Lamprey? and if not, in what respect did it differ?\r\n\r\nI am induced to ask these questions, both because by inference\r\nthey show my own opinions on the subject, and because I am led on\r\nundoubted authority to believe that Mr. Boccius is inclined to\r\nclaim at _least_ all that belongs to him; and also because I have\r\nmy doubts about the scientific attainments of Mr. Boccius in the\r\nNatural History of Fishes.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to prove a negative. My never having seen the\r\nstrange things above mentioned certainly does not prove that other\r\npeople with better eyes and more discrimination have likewise\r\nfailed to do so; but I can't help doubting, and I publish my\r\ndoubts in the hope that the subject may be further inquired into.\r\nA true naturalist ought only to wish for the truth, without\r\nreference to his own preconceived notions; but so far as my\r\nexaminations have gone, I have failed altogether to detect spawn\r\nin the fringes which I have fancied were the ovaria of the fish,\r\nor elsewhere, and I don't believe that Eels are bred in fresh\r\nwater at all. I see the fry ascending from the sea in May and June\r\nby thousands and millions, but I never met with one of these in a\r\npond having no communication with a river. I have little doubt\r\nthat I shall be pronounced in error touching this matter, except\r\nperhaps by those who know how perseveringly these little Eels make\r\ntheir way up every stream, ditch, and driblet of water into which\r\nthey can gain access. They penetrate into the water-pipes and\r\npumps; they climb up the perpendicular faces of the rocks and\r\nweirs which obstruct the course of the rivers, even when they are\r\nonly moist--adhering to the moss and stones like snails.\r\n\r\nThe downward migration of Eels is observed here from July to the\r\nmiddle of September, but in the Manchester market I find them up\r\nto this time (the end of November), and am informed that they are\r\ncaught at the foot of Windermere in their downward migration.\r\n\r\nWould a dissection of the Conger at various seasons throw any\r\nlight on the propagation of Eels? One would think that in such\r\nlarge fish the ovaria would be much more easily distinguished than\r\nin smaller specimens. (November, 1850.)\r\n\r\n_The above elicited the following reply:_--\r\n\r\nT. G. denies the possibility of Eels breeding in fresh water. We\r\nhave a pond here covering three or four acres which swarms with\r\nEels of all sizes. I have caught them from the size of my little\r\nfinger up to the weight of five pounds. The supply of water is\r\nfrom nothing else than land springs--there being no communication\r\nbetween the pond and any river. When much rain occurs I am obliged\r\nto put up a sluice-board, in order to prevent the banks from\r\noverflowing. I have taken from one to two hundredweight at a time\r\nfrom a box which the water flows through at the bottom of the\r\nsluice-board. The large quantity that has been taken out of this\r\npond leaves no doubt that they breed there to a great extent, but\r\nwhether they are propagated by spawn or brought forth alive I am\r\nunable to say.--G. H., _Finedon Hall_.\r\n\r\n_Reply to the foregoing._\r\n\r\nYour correspondent G. H. says T. G. denies the possibility of Eels\r\nbreeding in fresh water. This is rather too strong. I don't deny\r\nthe _possibility_ of Eels being bred in fresh water, I only deny\r\nthe _probability_. The expression I used was that I did not\r\nbelieve they were bred in fresh water at all, and I distinctly\r\nstated that my not having seen these things (Eel spawn, &c.), did\r\nnot prove that other people had not done so. But to the question.\r\nG. H. says that he has caught them of all sizes, from the\r\nthickness of his little finger to five pounds weight. No doubt he\r\nmay have done so, but did he catch them of the thickness of a\r\ncrow's quill, and three inches long? because that is the size at\r\nwhich they usually ascend rivers. He says his pond does not\r\ncommunicate with any river. Is there no escape of water from it? I\r\nmean, is the evaporation from its surface equal to the supply of\r\nwater? If not, where does the surplus go to? Does it not directly\r\nor indirectly flow into a river or the sea? I am the more inclined\r\nto think that this is the case, because G. H. says he caught a\r\nhundredweight at a time from a box which the water flows through\r\nat the bottom of the sluice-board. This is exceedingly like what\r\nis done here and elsewhere from July to the end of November, when\r\nthe Eels are on their downward migration. Will G. H. be kind\r\nenough to say whether he does not catch his about the same time?\r\nwill he also say whether the Eels he catches are not Silver Eels?\r\nand will he also state whether he does not catch them principally\r\nafter heavy rains have increased the flow of water out of the\r\npond? If he answers these questions in the affirmative, I shall\r\nstill think I am right, and request him to keep a sharp look-out\r\nafter rains in May and June, when I think he would probably see\r\nthe grigs passing through his box into the pond. If, on the other\r\nhand, there is no escape of water from the pond at any time, I\r\nmust admit that I am wrong, but at present I don't know how to\r\nreconcile the impounding the water so completely with what he says\r\nabout the flow of the water through the box at the bottom of the\r\nsill. Where does the water flow to, and for what is this sill?\r\n\r\n_G. H. replied as follows._\r\n\r\nT. G. asks if I have caught Eels of the size of a crow's quill. I\r\nhave caught them of the size of a tobacco-pipe, and from three to\r\nfour inches in length.\r\n\r\nOur surplus water flows indirectly into the river Nene from our\r\nsluice. It supplies some stews where we have been in the habit of\r\nkeeping reserve fish, and passing over several waterfalls, it\r\nenters into a ditch which is about three-quarters of a mile long,\r\nand then reaches the river I have just named.\r\n\r\nThe greatest take of Eels I have had was on the 23rd of December,\r\nbut the time of the year is of little consequence with us,\r\nprovided the water is thick and muddy and the weather rather warm,\r\nwhich, of course, only occurs during very heavy rains. If I were\r\nto draw all the water out of the pond when in a clear state, I\r\nshould not catch a fish. The variety is the Silver Eel. Our pond\r\nis upwards of fifty miles from the sea; therefore how is it that\r\nthose little Eels had got no larger during their long journey,\r\ninterrupted as it is by numerous and almost insurmountable\r\nobstacles, before they could reach the little ditch, three-\r\nquarters of a mile long, that would conduct them to our pond? And,\r\nlast of all, after this long and tedious journey, within a hundred\r\nyards of their destination they would have to climb four\r\nwaterfalls and a perpendicular sluice-board. It appears to me they\r\nshould have grown much larger than a common tobacco-pipe and\r\nlonger than three or four inches in that time, but I will leave\r\nthis point for T. G. to explain.--G. H., _Finedon Hall_.\r\n\r\n_Reply to the foregoing._\r\n\r\nMany thanks to G. H. for his second letter on this subject. It\r\nappears to me that we think very much alike about Eels.\r\n\r\nHe says his pond is fifty miles from the sea; \"therefore, how is\r\nit that these little Eels get no larger in their long and tedious\r\njourney? interrupted as it is by numerous and almost insurmountable\r\nobstacles, before they could reach the little ditch, three-quarters\r\nof a mile long, which would conduct them to our pond? and last of\r\nall, after this long and tedious journey, within a hundred yards\r\nof their destination, they would have to climb four waterfalls and\r\na perpendicular sluice-board. It appears to me they should have\r\ngrown much larger than a common tobacco-pipe during that time; but\r\nI will leave that point to T. G. to explain.\"\r\n\r\nThis is so fairly put, that I will tell what I have seen, hoping\r\nthat this will be a sufficient explanation.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1850, I chanced to go down to the bank of the Ribble, and\r\nthere I saw a column of small Eels steadily making their way up\r\nthe stream. I should suppose there might be fifty in every lineal\r\nyard, for they kept pretty close to the bank, apparently because\r\nthey met with less resistance from the stream, and without\r\npretending to accuracy I supposed they travelled at the rate of a\r\nmile an hour. This was about five o'clock in the afternoon, and I\r\nwent to look for them about nine in the evening--they were still\r\ngoing in one unbroken column. How long they had been going when I\r\nfirst saw them, and how long they continued to go after my second\r\nvisit, I don't know, but many thousands--perhaps millions--must\r\nhave passed that day. At this rate (of a mile an hour) they would\r\nhave required little more than two days to reach G. H.'s pond,\r\nfifty miles from the sea; but he says they had to pass over three\r\nor four waterfalls and a perpendicular sluice-board. If these\r\nwaterfalls and the sluice-board were covered with moss, they would\r\nclimb them as readily as a cat does a ladder. I have seen them in\r\nswarms at a perpendicular weir here, winding their way through the\r\ndamp moss with which the stones are covered; but this was not all:\r\nwhere there was no moss, the little things seemed to have the\r\npower of adhering to the perpendicular face of the stones, like so\r\nmany snails. I must not omit to remark, that although they seemed\r\nto choose the margin of the stream for the sake of easier\r\ntravelling, yet they took care to keep in the stream, as I had a\r\nnice opportunity of observing.\r\n\r\nAt the point where I first saw them, the tail goit of a water-\r\nwheel had its junction with the river, but being Sunday there was\r\nno current there--not a single Eel took its course up the goit,\r\nalthough the water was deeper there than where they went. The\r\nwater being low and perfectly clear, I could trace their course\r\nboth above and below the place where I stood without any\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\nIf we allowed that they travelled a mile in the hour, and that the\r\nobstructions of the waterfalls and sluice-board took as long to\r\nget over as all the rest of the journey, they would be able to\r\nreach G. H.'s pond in four days from the sea; and from what I have\r\nseen of their ability to surmount such obstructions, I am quite\r\nconvinced that they would travel that distance in the time. But\r\nsay they were a week--they would not grow much in that time,\r\nparticularly if they had been travelling without food the whole of\r\nthe distance, and that they must have done so, is proved to my\r\nmind by their keeping in column; for if they had dispersed to seek\r\nfor food, by what contrivance were they marshalled into line\r\nagain, to enable them to proceed? Now the place I saw them is\r\nforty miles from the sea, although not that distance from salt-\r\nwater. T. says it is no proof that Eels are bred in fresh water\r\nbecause they may be found in ponds having no connection with a\r\nriver--the proof required is _ab ovo_. If we wait for this proof I\r\nfear we will have to wait for some time, for I fancy that no one\r\nbut Mr. Boccius ever saw the ova of Eels, and he will not\r\ncondescend to enlighten us on the subject. At the same time I\r\nadmit that finding them there is no proof that they were bred\r\nthere, inasmuch as I have myself stocked such ponds for my\r\nfriends, and what I have done may be done by others.\r\n\r\nT. says further there is also room for inquiry into another\r\ncurious subject--do Eels return to fresh water after having gone\r\nto the sea for spawning? In reply to this, I can only say, that no\r\ntrace of such a migration is ever seen here, and I think if it\r\nexisted at all, I should have observed it, for the following\r\nreasons.\r\n\r\nThe Ribble here supplies a large mill, the water-wheels of which\r\nare 150 horse-power; therefore, when they are at work in the\r\ndaytime, the whole force of the river is often passing through the\r\nmill-lead (goit) and the bed of the river between the weir, and\r\nthe tail goit in such times is left dry, except in a few pools. If\r\nthere was a shoal of Eels between these two points it would have\r\nbeen seen at one time or another, and this has never happened, so\r\nfar as I know. It may be said that they migrate singly, but they\r\ndon't do so in their first migration, and, so far as I am aware,\r\nit is not the habit of any animal to do so. Herrings, Pilchards,\r\nSmelts, Flounders, Sturgeon, Bisons, Antelopes, Woodcocks,\r\nSwallows, Fieldfares, Locusts, and even Butterflies congregate\r\ntogether previous to migration.\r\n\r\nNOTE.--The last paragraph requires some modification, as I have\r\nsince proved that Eels migrate singly when going to the sea, as I\r\nhave had occasion to know in a hundred cases when watching my Eel-\r\ntrap, where every Eel may be seen as it descends into the trap.\r\n\r\n_On the same subject._\r\n\r\nI [Jeremiah Garnett, brother of the writer, and editor of the\r\n\"Manchester Guardian,\"] having noticed the communications on this\r\nsubject which have recently appeared in your columns, am desirous\r\nof mentioning a fact which appears to me to throw some light upon\r\nthe localities in which Eels are bred, though it leaves the\r\nquestion of the mode of generation precisely where it stood\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nLike your correspondent T. G., I have many times seen columns of\r\nsmall Eels ascending the Ribble and other rivers in the months of\r\nMay and June, at considerable distances from the sea, but only on\r\none occasion have I seen them under circumstances which evidently\r\nbrought them near the place of their nativity.\r\n\r\nI happened to be attending the Lancaster Spring Assizes in the\r\nmonth of March in the year 1826, and learning that there was a\r\nremarkably high tide in the estuary of the Lune, I walked down to\r\nthe riverside about the time of high water, and found that the\r\ntide had covered the grass in many places; and as it began to ebb,\r\nI observed something moving in every small hollow which had been\r\noverflowed, and in which a little water had been left behind. On\r\nexamination I found that the moving bodies were exceedingly\r\ndiminutive Eels, rather less, to the best of my recollection, than\r\nthree-quarters of an inch long, and almost transparent, but\r\nexhibiting in every respect the true form of the mature Eel. They\r\nhad evidently followed the water to its extreme verge, where it\r\ncould not have been more than an inch deep, and that they must\r\nhave been very numerous was clear from the large numbers which\r\nwere left behind and had perished--for that they did perish I\r\nfound on the following day, when they were lying dead on the grass\r\nby hundreds. Some of your correspondents who reside in localities\r\nfavourable for making observations on this subject may be induced\r\nto pay attention to it; the exact appearance may be ascertained,\r\nwith probably other facts calculated to throw light on the obscure\r\nquestion of their generation.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nON THE POSSIBILITY OF INTRODUCING SALMON INTO NEW ZEALAND AND\r\nAUSTRALIA.\r\n\r\n_October_, 1859.\r\n\r\nThe colonists of Australia, Tasmania, and New Zealand appear to\r\nwish for the introduction of Salmon and Trout into the rivers of\r\nthese colonies, and one of them, Tasmania, is said to have offered\r\nthe reward of L500 for the first pair of live Salmon which reaches\r\nthat colony. If this is true it is a liberal offer, and one that\r\nis likely to induce various persons, both in England and France,\r\nto make the attempt.\r\n\r\nI should be sorry to say anything to check so laudable an\r\nendeavour, but I greatly fear that Van Diemen's Land (to say\r\nnothing of the Australian colonies) is too near the tropics to\r\noffer a reasonable chance of success. I think it is practicable to\r\ntake these fish there (or at least fertilized ova), but I don't\r\nthink they would live and thrive in the rivers of that colony.\r\nNever having been there, I can, of course, only reason from\r\nEuropean experience, but the best inquiries I can make lead me to\r\nsuppose that there are no Salmon in France (south of Brittany),\r\nSpain, or any of the countries washed by the Mediterranean Sea;\r\nand in America (although I confess I am not so well informed on\r\nthat country) I have never heard of Salmon being seen to the south\r\nof the tributaries of the St. Lawrence. Supposing this to be so, I\r\nthink that we may fairly infer that if Salmon are not found south\r\nof a certain latitude in Europe and America, it must be that the\r\nclimate of these southern countries is not congenial to the habits\r\nof this fish. I believe, however, that the Trout lives and thrives\r\nmuch further south than the Salmon; for instance, it is found in\r\nthe Pyrenees and in the lakes of Northern Italy (Lady M. W.\r\nMontagu). It is also found in Northern Turkey, and probably\r\nAlbania also (Spencer); and therefore I think it is quite probable\r\nthat it might live in Tasmania--that is, if the streams are never\r\ndried up and the rivers reduced to a number of water-holes, which\r\nappears to be the case in Australia. Should this be the case in\r\nTasmania also, I doubt whether even Trout would thrive, for here\r\nin Lancashire I have known the Trout to die in great numbers from\r\nthe heat, when, owing to the water-wheels of the mill diverting\r\nthe river from its usual channel, there was no stream, but merely\r\na series of detached pools or water-holes; and the Grayling seem\r\nto be more incommoded by heat than the Trout, and it was one of\r\nthe diversions of my boyhood to wait until the wheels of my\r\nfather's mill were stopped in the hot weather, and then go up the\r\ncovered wheel-races in search of the Grayling that had gone there\r\nto get out of the sunshine. I used to catch them there in great\r\nnumbers. However, this has nothing to do with the matter, except\r\nto suggest that although Grayling are very desirable fish to\r\nintroduce into the colonies, I fear they would be too impatient of\r\nheat to thrive there. But my object in addressing you is to ask\r\nwhether it is true that the legislature of Tasmania has offered\r\nthe prize of L500 for the first pair of live Salmon taken there?\r\n\r\nSecondly, whether they offer a prize for the introduction of\r\nSalmon fry; and if so, what is the amount offered?\r\n\r\nThirdly, whether they offer a prize for the introduction of\r\nfertilized ova of Salmon or Trout, and what is the amount?\r\n\r\nI ask these questions because I happen to know a good deal on such\r\nmatters, and I have been applied to this day by James Birch, the\r\nhead water-bailiff of our river (Ribble), to obtain some\r\ninformation for him on the subject, as he seems seriously bent on\r\nmaking the experiment, provided the reward be an adequate one;\r\nfor, to be successful, it would involve the necessity of his\r\nmaking the voyage himself, and it would be a cruel thing to induce\r\nhim to do so, and in the end to find that he was entitled to no\r\nreward.\r\n\r\nI'll say this for him, that if he tries he will succeed, if\r\nsuccess be possible; but his pecuniary resources are too limited\r\nfor him to undertake such a risk.\r\n\r\nI have reason to believe that he has been applied to by Ramsbottom\r\nto go to Tasmania, but this he declines to do under Ramsbottom's\r\nauspices. As he (R.) professes to be in communication with the\r\nauthorities of Tasmania (or at all events with influential persons\r\nthere) let him make the first attempt, and if he succeed, there\r\nwill be no necessity to apply to me on the subject; but if he\r\nshould fail--as I think he will--why, then the persons interested\r\nin the matter may, if they wish to try again, let me know their\r\nwishes and the amount of remuneration they mean to give.\r\n\r\nI should certainly suggest that both Salmon and Salmon Trout (as\r\nwell as the common Trout) should be included in their list of\r\ndesiderata, and although for reasons previously given I have no\r\ngreat hopes of success with the two former, I think it quite\r\nprobable that the common Trout would succeed better. Of course I\r\nknow nothing of the fish already in the rivers of Tasmania; for\r\naught I know there may be fish in all those rivers quite as\r\nvoracious and destructive as the Pike are here. If this is the\r\ncase, the chances of success would be materially lessened, as\r\nTrout and Salmon fry are rare in all rivers stocked with Pike.\r\nHowever, those who are making the attempt ought to know what they\r\nare about, and will, no doubt, have considered such obstacles, if\r\nthere are any such in the way. Will you, therefore, be kind enough\r\nto answer the questions I have asked above, at your earliest\r\nconvenience, and if your replies offer any inducement to Birch to\r\nmake the attempt, I have no doubt that he will be quite ready to\r\ndo so.\r\n\r\nFor various reasons he can only start from here in the autumn or\r\nwinter, and he should, if he reaches Tasmania with either live\r\nfish or fertilized ova, have someone to render him prompt and\r\ncordial assistance to enable him to deposit the fish or ova, or\r\nfish and ova, in suitable places for spawning and hatching; and\r\ntherefore if this letter be replied to, the answer ought to say to\r\nwhom Birch should apply on his arrival in Tasmania.\r\n\r\nIt may be asked, who is the man who obtrudes his opinions on the\r\ncolony unasked, and what can be his motives? As I am not aware\r\nthat I know a single person in Tasmania, I cannot refer to anyone\r\nthere; but I happen to know one or two gentlemen in Melbourne, and\r\nif you will take the trouble to refer there to Messrs. W. and B.\r\nHick, or to W. Bailey, the corn merchant, they will be able to\r\nsatisfy all inquiries.\r\n\r\nIf it be asked what I know of the habits of fish, and Salmon in\r\nparticular, I beg to refer the inquirers to Loudon's \"Magazine of\r\nNatural History\" for 1834 (if there is a copy of that work in the\r\ncolony), and they will there find two papers (signed \"T.G.,\"\r\nClitheroe) which will show that I then knew all that has since\r\nbeen proved by the elaborate experiments made at Perth by\r\nRamsbottom, and moreover I taught Ramsbottom himself the art of\r\npropagating fish artificially.\r\n\r\nI want no compensation: the honour of being the first man who\r\nsucceeded in introducing these valuable fish into the colonies\r\nwould be a sufficient reward to me. But with Birch the case is\r\ndifferent: he is a working man, and L500 would be a fortune to\r\nhim. On the other hand, he could not afford to come to Hobart Town\r\nfrom England at his own expense, as he has not the means.\r\n\r\nWould the colony, if other attempts failed, be willing to pay\r\nBirch's passage out and home if he failed also, and would he\r\nreceive the L500 if he succeeded?\r\n\r\nBy success I mean that he would either bring live fish or ova that\r\nwould hatch into live fish. Either of these objects being\r\naccomplished, he ought, in my opinion, to receive the reward; for\r\nalthough he would attempt both, he would probably fail in the\r\nformer.\r\n\r\nShould he attempt this under my advice, I should not only send\r\nSalmon and Salmon Trout and their ova, but the common brown Trout\r\nand its ova also, for the reason previously given in this letter;\r\nand although I am by no means sanguine of success, on account of\r\nthe temperature, the experiment is too important to be abandoned\r\nfor a mere theoretical objection which may be erroneous.\r\n\r\nI think New Zealand offers far greater chances of success. It is\r\nnot only further removed from the tropics, but, if I am rightly\r\ninformed, the streams are more abundant and constant than those of\r\nAustralia and Tasmania--in fact, I believe it is as well watered\r\nas this country; and if the authorities there are as much alive to\r\nthe importance of introducing these fish into their rivers, I\r\nwould undertake to do this with much greater confidence of\r\nultimate success than I should have if I undertook to introduce\r\nthem into Tasmania or the sister colonies.\r\n\r\nSome time since (it may be eighteen months or two years ago) there\r\nwas a very intelligent correspondent of the \"Field\" newspaper,\r\nwhose _nom de plume_ was the Maori one, \"Wetariki no te wai\r\nHerekeke,\" or a similar one; and I having written something in the\r\n\"Field\" on this subject, the New Zealander asked for my address,\r\nwhich, for some private reason of his own, the Editor declined to\r\ngive until so long a time had elapsed that Wetariki Herekeke had\r\nreturned to the colony--this I learnt from an indirect source--\r\notherwise I should have tried to induce him to undertake the\r\nexperiment of introducing all the various species of the genus\r\nSalmo which are to be found in our rivers.\r\n\r\nIf the colonists of New Zealand wish to make the attempt, I shall\r\nbe most happy to render them all the assistance in my power, and I\r\nknow no one so qualified as Birch to undertake the management of\r\nsuch an experiment; for he is exceedingly intelligent, has a\r\nperfect knowledge of the habits of both Trout and Salmon, and\r\nthoroughly understands the feeding of fish, both in their natural\r\nhaunts and artificially, and would consequently be able to select\r\nsuitable localities for conducting such an experiment to a\r\nsuccessful issue.\r\n\r\nNOTE.--No reply was given to this by the authorities of Tasmania,\r\nbut a similar communication, addressed to the Governor of New\r\nZealand, elicited a very polite reply from his secretary, in which\r\nhe said that there were no funds available for such a purpose, but\r\nthat the subject would be brought before the legislature on their\r\nassembling, and would no doubt meet with their favourable\r\nconsideration; but the Maori troubles broke out immediately after,\r\nand I heard no more about it.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nCLITHEROE, _October 14th_, 1859.\r\n\r\nTo the Editor of the \"Field.\"\r\n\r\nIn the \"Field\" of some weeks since, it was stated that the\r\ncolonists of Tasmania were offering a large reward for the\r\nintroduction of live Salmon, Salmon fry, or the fertilized ova of\r\nSalmon.\r\n\r\nWill you have the kindness to say what was the amount offered? who\r\nwere the parties who made themselves responsible for the payment?\r\nand what time did they give within which they would pay for a\r\nsuccessful attempt?\r\n\r\nI am the more anxious to have this information, because I have\r\nbeen applied to for advice by an exceedingly likely person, as the\r\nreward (L500) which he understood to be offered is to him so\r\ntempting a sum, that he would need very little encouragement to\r\nundertake the management of the experiment; and from what I know\r\nof him I will venture to assert that he will succeed, if success\r\nbe practicable.\r\n\r\nBut before I speak confidently of success, I would like a little\r\nmore information, and will thank any of your readers who are able\r\nto do so, to give me replies to the following questions:--\r\n\r\nAre there any Salmon in the rivers of Spain, or in France, south\r\nof the Loire, or even in that river? If not, why not?\r\n\r\nAre there any Salmon in North America, in any river (not a\r\ntributary of the St. Lawrence), south of that river? If there are,\r\nwhat rivers in the States contain Salmon.\r\n\r\nDo any of the rivers on the west coast of America below the\r\nlatitude of 40 degrees N. contain Salmon?\r\n\r\nDo any of the rivers of China (not Chinese Tartary) contain\r\nSalmon?\r\n\r\nIf I am right in supposing that the rivers I have pointed out have\r\nno Salmon in them, is it not exceedingly probable that the high\r\ntemperature of these southern countries is unsuited to the habits\r\nand uncongenial to the health of these fish? Or how is it when\r\nthey are on the same seaboard further north, they don't ascend\r\nthese rivers, unless there are some such objections to their doing\r\nso? And if these objections really exist, then do they not equally\r\nexist in the rivers of Australia and Tasmania?\r\n\r\nBut there may be other objections equally fatal: there may be fish\r\nin their rivers as voracious and destructive as our Pike; there\r\nmay be Sharks and other fish in their seas and estuaries, which\r\nwould snap up every Salmon that entered them. There may be Seals,\r\nPorpoises, Albatrosses, Man-of-War birds, and Cormorants, as well\r\nas fifty other nameless enemies, all combining their efforts to\r\ndefeat so desirable a consummation; and, after all, there may be\r\nno one willing to make himself responsible for a repayment of the\r\nnecessary expenses, for corporations and public bodies are\r\nproverbially untrustworthy.\r\n\r\nYet, notwithstanding all these doubts of success, I think the\r\nexperiment ought to be made; for its success would confer so great\r\na boon on the colony in which it was made, that they (the\r\ncolonists) ought to incur considerable risk and outlay for the\r\nchance of success, however small. I don't think there will be much\r\ndifficulty in carrying fertilized ova there, but when hatched I\r\nfear they would not thrive.\r\n\r\nI think New Zealand offers far better chances of success: it is\r\nfurther from the tropics, it abounds in suitable rivers, the\r\nclimate and temperature are more like England, and I believe the\r\nrivers never degenerate into mere water-holes, as they seem to do\r\nin Australia; and I think the residents of that colony ought to\r\nmake a vigorous attempt to introduce Salmon, Salmon Trout, and the\r\ncommon brown Trout into their rivers immediately; and I should be\r\ndelighted to render all the assistance in my power to accomplish\r\nso desirable an object.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nON THE FORMATION OF ICE AT THE BOTTOM OF RIVERS.\r\n\r\n_Anchor Frosts._\r\n\r\nA correspondent of the \"Magazine of Natural History,\" in\r\nendeavouring to explain the causes why water freezes at the bottom\r\nin rapid streams, says this unusual phenomenon may be rationally\r\naccounted for by anyone who has attended to it; that the streams\r\nin which anchor frosts occur generally are those which contain\r\nwater of different temperatures--viz., surface-drainage and land\r\nsprings and main springs, the first being always colder than the\r\nlatter, in winter these never being less than 40 degrees, even in\r\nsevere frosts.\r\n\r\nThese colder globules being first frozen, float on the surface of\r\nthe water individually, being prevented from coalescing by the\r\nintermediate main-spring-water, and where the water passes in a\r\nshallow stream over the pebbles the crystals are intercepted by\r\nthe interstices of the stones, and then become heaped together in\r\nthick beds.\r\n\r\nThe fact of the crystals of ice (which are specifically lighter\r\nthan the water) sinking below the surface, is a circumstance\r\nrequiring explanation. They do not sink from their specific\r\ngravity, but in the commotion of the current they are occasionally\r\nsubmerged, and while so are stopped by any obstruction, when they\r\ncommence and compose the aggregation.\r\n\r\nThinking this was an erroneous view of the matter, I replied as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\nJ. M., in his remarks on anchor frosts, appears to me to have\r\nfallen into several errors in endeavouring to account for them\r\n(they are called bottom frosts in Yorkshire); for, admitting that\r\nmain springs are of the temperature stated (40 degrees) when they\r\nissue from the earth, I am by no means prepared to believe that\r\nthey keep that temperature long, or that the water issuing from\r\nthem does not mingle intimately and immediately with the water of\r\nthe river into which it flows; especially in the situations where\r\nanchor frosts are most common, which are rough and rapid streams.\r\n\r\nFrom J. M.'s statement it would appear that globules of water of\r\ndifferent temperatures mix together without the one imparting its\r\nexcess of caloric to the other, which is contrary to the\r\nexperience of everyone; it is true, that in still places there\r\nwill be different temperatures in the same body of water, but it\r\nis not owing to the main springs of which J. M. speaks, but to the\r\npeculiar way in which water is affected by cold. It is well known\r\nthat water increases in density down to 40 degrees, below which\r\ntemperature it begins to expand, and this expansion continues\r\nuntil it reaches the freezing-point, so that in severe frosts\r\nthere will be strata of different temperatures from 32 degrees to\r\n40 degrees. Again, he says that \"the crystals of ice are\r\nintercepted by the interstices of the stones, and then become\r\nheaped together in thick beds;\" but if my observations are\r\ncorrect, these depositions begin first round the large stones,\r\nwhich are not likely to stop small spiculae any more than are the\r\nwater-gates of mills, where, he says, the accumulations also take\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nAnchor frosts are most common in the rapid streams occurring below\r\ndeeps in rivers, and I have seen a weir on the river Wharfe which\r\nhad a wall of ice four feet high formed upon it in a single night\r\nby a sharp north wind. In my opinion a sufficient explanation of\r\nthis freezing at the bottom of rivers is to be found in the fact\r\nthat water when kept still may be cooled down below the freezing-\r\npoint without being congealed; but if the vessel in which it is\r\nkept be shaken, a portion of it will be converted into a porous,\r\nspongy ice, and the temperature immediately rises to 32 degrees.\r\nIn the deeps of rivers the same cooling below the freezing-point\r\ntakes place without congelation, but as soon as this water reaches\r\nthe stream below, the agitation immediately converts a portion of\r\nit into ice, which collects round the large stones at the bottom\r\nin the same way that crystallization commences in a solution of\r\nsalt or sugar around a piece of thread or other substance which\r\nmay be suspended in it. If a severe frost is followed by a bright\r\nday, thousands of these detached pieces of spongy ice may be seen\r\nrising from the stones which have served as nuclei for them; which\r\nproves that the detention of them is not merely mechanical, but\r\nthat precipitation (if I may be allowed to call it so) takes place\r\nin the first instance, the stone serving as a nucleus, and that\r\nthis adhesion is destroyed by the action of the sun's rays.\r\n\r\nI have never seen any attempt to explain the phenomenon of bottom-\r\nfrosts before this of J. M.'s, and I am not philosopher enough to\r\nspeak positively on the subject; but the above is the way in which\r\nI have always endeavoured to account for it. Perhaps some of your\r\nscientific readers may be able to give much better reasons for it\r\nthan have been offered either by J. M. or myself. (January 17th,\r\n1832.)\r\n\r\nAnother writer (J. Carr, of Alnwick,) says that anchor frosts are\r\nmerely long and severe ones where long masses of ice are frozen to\r\nthe stones at the bottom of rapid streams, and this is simply\r\nowing to these stones acquiring a degree of cold far below the\r\nfreezing-point, and the water in contact with them freezing and\r\nspreading into large sheets of ice, which are sometimes torn up\r\nand carry away the gravel adhering to the under surface.\r\n\r\nThinking that this was an error, I again wrote to the \"Magazine of\r\nNatural History\" as below:--\r\n\r\nI perceive that others beside myself have endeavoured to account\r\nfor anchor frosts. Mr. Carr says they never occur except in long\r\nand severe frosts, and that the adhesion of the ice to the stones\r\nat the bottom is owing to their acquiring a degree of cold far\r\nbelow the freezing-point. He is in error when he says they never\r\noccur except in long-continued frosts, as the walls of ice which\r\nare sometimes raised on the crowns of weirs are invariably (so far\r\nas my observations have extended) deposited there _before_ the\r\nwater in the reservoir above is frozen over, which proves that the\r\nfrost has not been of long continuance, although it may have been\r\nsevere. As to what he says about the stones acquiring a degree of\r\ncold far below the freezing-point, and imparting that coldness to\r\nthe water, I would just ask how it is that a stone at the bottom\r\nof a river acquires this excess of cold, and if it is not more\r\nprobable that the stones impart warmth to the surrounding water? I\r\ncan easily conceive how the stones may, by the action of the sun's\r\nrays upon them, warm the surrounding water; but I do not see how\r\nthey can impart cold, or, in other words, how their temperature\r\ncan be reduced below that of the water by which they are\r\nsurrounded. Stones certainly impart warmth to the water they are\r\nin, in bright weather, as the rays of the sun do not give much\r\nwarmth in passing through any transparent medium; but on coming in\r\ncontact with any opaque bodies, the heat is absorbed or reflected\r\nas the case may be, and in this way transparent media such as air\r\nand water acquire a warmth by contact which they would not\r\notherwise possess. Thus, if an anchor frost is followed by a\r\nbright day, the rays of the sun impart so much warmth to the\r\nstones at the bottom of the river as is sufficient to liberate the\r\nice from them, and on such days thousands of pieces of ice may be\r\nseen rising from the bottom and floating down the streams.\r\n\r\nSince my former observations were written I have had the\r\nsatisfaction of finding my views on the subject confirmed by a\r\nvery eminent chemist, [15] and if the discussions in your Magazine\r\nwere to be settled by authority, and not by argument (which I\r\ntrust will never be the case), he is one to whom many would be\r\ninclined to appeal, and to whom few would refuse to submit. (May\r\n2nd, 1832.)\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nTo the Editor of the \"Agricultural Gazette.\"\r\n\r\nIn a leading article of the 10th of January, 1852, after an\r\naccount of the effects produced on water by radiation and the\r\nprotection afforded to plants by the ice with which ponds are\r\ncovered in winter, you go on to say that there are some\r\ncircumstances under which water-plants suffer greatly, and from a\r\nsingular cause, but one which when looked into is sufficiently\r\nsimple and intelligible. As you do not appear to have hit upon the\r\ntrue reason, allow me to quote a little further, and then give my\r\nreason for this singular effect.\r\n\r\nYou say that on a very fine but still night, water is cooled less\r\nrapidly than the earth: under such circumstances the bottom of the\r\npond cools more rapidly than the surface, the plants become\r\ncolder--in fact, some degrees below the freezing-point, &c. &c.\r\n\r\nI submit that such reasons are inadmissible, for there would be an\r\nimmediate upward current, which, as water is such an excellent\r\nconductor of heat, would immediately equalize the temperature of\r\nall the water above 40 degrees Fahrenheit, and stratified (if I\r\nmay use the expression) above the water of this temperature there\r\nwould be another layer of water of equal but gradually decreasing\r\ntemperature until it fell below 32 degrees Fahrenheit.\r\n\r\nThe explanation I offer is this. It is well known that if water is\r\nkept perfectly still it may be cooled down considerably, or at\r\nleast some degrees below 32 degrees, without freezing; but the\r\nmoment it is shaken a portion of it is converted into a spongy,\r\nporous ice, and the temperature rises to 32 degrees.\r\n\r\nWhat may be the case in the rivers of the South of England I do\r\nnot know, but in the rapid streams of the North this process may\r\nbe seen on a very extensive scale in severe frosts. The water in\r\nthe still pools (before they are frozen over) is cooled down to\r\nbelow 32 degrees, and so soon as this cooled water reaches the\r\nnext stream, precipitation (if I may so call it) takes place, and\r\nthe spongy ice lays hold of every projecting pebble, which serves\r\nas a nucleus in the same way as threads and bits of stick serve in\r\nthe crystallization of salts. After a severe frost, when followed\r\nby bright sunshine the next morning, I have seen thousands of\r\nthese bits of spongy ice rising from the stones to which they had\r\nbeen attached to the surface of the water. I have seen after long-\r\ncontinued frost the course of a stream completely altered by this\r\nbottom-ice (as it is called here), and I have also seen a weir\r\nwith a wall of ice on it three feet high (raised in a single\r\nnight) by the same cause. Now apply this to the bottom-ice in\r\nponds (which however I must confess I never saw). The night being\r\ncalm, the water gets cool below 32 degrees, but then a breeze\r\nspringing up the water becomes agitated, precipitation takes\r\nplace, and the plants serving as nuclei become immediately clothed\r\nwith this spongy ice, and the sun shining next morning imparts so\r\nmuch warmth to the plants that the ice thaws which is in contact\r\nwith them, and rises to the surface. Of course if the sun does not\r\nshine next morning, and the frost continues, the plants may be\r\nclothed with ice for a long time.\r\n\r\nTo the foregoing the Editor of the \"Agricultural Gazette\" replied\r\nas follows:--\r\n\r\nWe cannot admit the soundness of our correspondent's explanation\r\nof the formation of bottom-ice or ground _gore_. We are well\r\nacquainted with the statements of Arago and other writers as to\r\nthe cause of this curious phenomenon, and after a careful\r\nconsideration of the subject believe that it is due to radiation\r\nand not to any other cause. Bottom-ice has been observed in ponds\r\non perfectly still nights when there was no breeze to agitate the\r\nsurface of the water.\r\n\r\nThe waters in the pools between the rapids of rivers can hardly\r\never be still enough for the water to fall below the freezing-\r\npoint and yet remain fluid; the temperature of water in such\r\nsituations is not below 33 degrees.\r\n\r\nThe following was my rejoinder:--\r\n\r\nYou say at the end of remarks about bottom-ice that you cannot\r\nadmit the soundness of my explanation, and that you are well aware\r\nof what is said by Arago and others on this curious phenomenon,\r\nand that bottom-ice has been observed in ponds when there was no\r\nbreeze, and that the water in pools between the rapids of weirs\r\ncan hardly ever be still enough to fall below the freezing-point,\r\nand yet remain fluid.\r\n\r\nI was not aware before seeing your remarks that either Arago or\r\nany other philosopher had ever written about bottom-ice, and even\r\nnow I do not know what are their opinions on the subject, and if\r\nthe discussions in your paper are to be settled by authority and\r\nnot by argument, I can only make my bow and withdraw; but if it\r\nmeets your views to allow your correspondents to state their\r\nopinions temperately, and support them by such arguments as occur\r\nto them, I do not yet feel inclined to give up my notions about\r\nbottom-ice. Will you allow me to ask whether you ever personally\r\nsaw ice at the bottom of a pond when there was none on the\r\nsurface? and if so, under what circumstances? I have heard of such\r\nan occurrence, but never witnessed it, and feel inclined to doubt\r\nthe fact unless you will vouch for it; for it appears to me that\r\nthe moment the water at the bottom falls below 40 degrees it will\r\nbegin to rise to the surface, and it is so excellent a conductor\r\nthat it will instantly equalize the temperature of the mud at the\r\nbottom with that of its own temperature.\r\n\r\nI am neither chemist nor meteorologist, and therefore I am not\r\nable to say much about radiation; but my idea of it is, that its\r\neffects in water would be much greater in still pools than in\r\nrapid streams, and that, therefore, if radiation was the cause of\r\nbottom-ice, there ought to be more of it in the pools than in the\r\nrapid streams. But the contrary is the fact, for after a severe\r\nnight's frost, I can frequently find the streams filled with this\r\nbottom-ice, when none can be observed in the pools.\r\n\r\nAgain, can the fact of the weir which had a wall of this bottom-\r\nice three feet high in a single night, be accounted for by\r\nradiation? It appears to me to be very easily accounted for by\r\nsupposing that the water in the deep above was so quietly cooled\r\ndown as to retain its fluidity until the shaking it got on flowing\r\nover the weir suddenly produced congelation. I think that\r\nradiation would not go on at the crown of the weir alone.\r\n\r\nWhy do you think that the water in pools is never still enough to\r\nallow it to get below 32 degrees without freezing on still clear\r\nnights? In long deep pools, where the body of the water is perhaps\r\na hundred times as great as the current flowing into it, the\r\nmotion is so extremely slow that I cannot for a moment doubt that\r\nit gets below 32 degrees without congelation, but when it arrives\r\nat a rapid, this ice is immediately formed.\r\n\r\nThe Editor closed the discussion at this point by saying that the\r\nsubject was not of sufficient agricultural importance to be\r\ncontinued further.\r\n\r\nThe following is my brother Richard Garnett's [16] account of his\r\nobservations on bottom-frosts. (The paper was written in 1818, and\r\npublished in the \"Journal of the Royal Institution.\")\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nON THE PRODUCTION OF ICE AT THE BOTTOMS OF RIVERS.\r\n\r\nThe phenomenon of the production of ice at the bottoms of rivers\r\nhas been repeatedly noticed, but I am not aware that any\r\nsatisfactory solution of the cause has hitherto been given. In\r\nNicholson's \"Dictionary of Chemistry,\" several different\r\nhypotheses are enumerated, which I shall not stop now to examine,\r\nsince it may be safely asserted that they neither accord with the\r\nestablished principles of chemistry, nor with the facts for which\r\nthey endeavour to account. The most recent theory with which I am\r\nacquainted is that of Mr. A. Knight, who in a paper lately\r\npublished in the \"Philosophical Transactions,\" seems to consider\r\nthe particles of ice as originally formed at the surface, and\r\nafterwards absorbed by the eddies of streams to the bottom. He\r\nstates, in support of this idea, that he did not observe any\r\nsimilar phenomenon in still water. I shall advert to this\r\nhypothesis in the sequel, and at present it may suffice to remark\r\nof it and all others which I have hitherto seen, that supposing\r\nany of them to be correct, the same effects ought regularly to be\r\nproduced whenever the atmosphere is at a similar temperature, or\r\nin other words, that whenever the frost is so intense as\r\nmaterially to affect the water of a river, we may then expect to\r\nfind ice at the bottom. Now this is certainly not the case, since\r\nthe appearance we are treating of never occurs but under peculiar\r\n_atmospherical_ circumstances, and rivers are frequently frozen\r\nover, and remain so for a length of time without a particle of ice\r\nbeing visible at the bottom of their streams. I do not now profess\r\nto have developed this mystery, but merely intend to state the\r\ncircumstances under which the phenomenon takes place, as well as a\r\nfew particulars connected with it, which are perhaps not generally\r\nknown, and which may hereafter be serviceable as data for\r\ninvestigating the cause.\r\n\r\nIt is well known to meteorologists that a severe frost in winter\r\ndoes not always commence in a uniform manner. Sometimes it begins\r\nwith a gentle wind from the E. or N.E., and is at first\r\ncomparatively mild in its operations, but afterwards gradually\r\nincreases in intensity. Frosts of this kind are generally more\r\nlasting than others, and during such, I have not observed that any\r\nice is generated at the bottoms of streams; though the deep and\r\nstill parts of rivers are often frozen over to a considerable\r\nextent. At other times, during the continuance of the violent\r\nsouth-westerly gales which are so prevalent in this country in the\r\nwinter months, the wind frequently shifts on a sudden from S.W. to\r\nN.W., commonly about an hour before sunset, and blows with great\r\nimpetuosity in the latter direction, attended with a severe frost,\r\nand sometimes with a heavy fall of snow. The effects of this\r\nfrost, in places exposed to the wind, are extremely rapid, so as\r\nto render the ground impenetrably hard in about a couple of hours\r\nfrom its commencement. Situations that are not so much exposed\r\nseem comparatively little affected--at least, I have repeatedly\r\nobserved that a small sheltered pond in a field was nearly free\r\nfrom ice, while the current of a large and rapid river at no great\r\ndistance was nearly choked up by it. I believe that the phenomenon\r\nunder consideration seldom occurs except during such frosts as\r\nthese, and the following are the principal circumstances connected\r\nwith it which I am able to state from my own observation.\r\n\r\nIt may here be premised that ice of this description is seldom\r\nseen adhering to anything beside rock, stone, or gravel, and that\r\nit is more abundantly produced in proportion to the greater\r\nmagnitude and number of the stones composing the bed of the river,\r\ncombined (as will be further noticed) with the velocity of the\r\ncurrent. I have been informed by a friend that he has occasionally\r\nseen it attached to solid wooden piles at a considerable depth\r\nbelow the surface of the water, but I never saw or heard of any on\r\nearth, mud, or clay. It is not easy to ascertain the precise time\r\nat which the process begins to take place. It appears, however,\r\nalmost invariably to commence during the first night of the frost,\r\nand probably within a few hours after sunset. On the ensuing\r\nmorning the first thing which strikes an observer is an immense\r\nquantity of detached plates of ice floating down the stream. Mr.\r\nKnight naturally enough supposed these to have been formed at the\r\nsurface by the influence of the freezing atmosphere, and\r\nafterwards absorbed by the current; but I think that a minute\r\ninspection would have led him to form a different conclusion--\r\nviz., that they are first formed in the bed of the river, and\r\nafterwards rise to the surface. It is true that none are to be\r\nseen in situations where there is no sensible current, and that\r\nthey abound most in rough and rapid places; but on closely\r\nexamining any stream of moderate velocity, yet smooth, equable,\r\nand free from all appearance of eddy or rippling, a great number\r\nof these plates of ice will be found adhering to the rock, stone,\r\nor gravel at the bottom. If they are watched with attention, they\r\nwill be observed to rapidly increase in bulk, till at last, on\r\naccount of their inferior specific gravity, aided, perhaps, by the\r\naction of the current, they detach themselves from the substances\r\nto which they first adhered, and rise to the surface of the water.\r\nThe form of these pieces of ice is very irregular, depending in a\r\ngreat measure on the size and shape of the stones or other\r\nsubstances to which they were originally attached. Most of them\r\nseem to be of an oblong or circular figure; they are generally\r\nconvex on the upper surface, and have a number of laminae and\r\nspiculae shooting from them in various directions, especially from\r\ntheir circumference. Sometimes when those floating pieces or\r\nplates meet with any obstruction in the channel of the river, they\r\naccumulate in such quantities as to cover the surface of the\r\nwater, and become frozen together in one large sheet, but this\r\nkind of ice may be always readily distinguished from that produced\r\nin the usual way by the action of the cold air on the surface,\r\nwhich is smooth, transparent, and of an uniform texture; on the\r\ncontrary, one of these conglomerated fields or sheets is opaque,\r\nuneven, full of asperities, and the form of each separate plate\r\ncomposing it may be distinctly traced. In this situation, they\r\ngenerally assume the shape of irregular polygons, with angles\r\nsomewhat rounded; a form apparently caused by the lateral pressure\r\nof the contiguous pieces.\r\n\r\nOn the river Wharfe, near Otley, in the West Riding of Yorkshire,\r\nis a weir or milldam where this phenomenon is sometimes manifested\r\nin a striking manner. This structure is of hewn stone, forming a\r\nplane inclined at an angle of from 35 degrees to 50 degrees,\r\nfronting the north and extending from west to east, to the length\r\nof 250 or 300 yards. When one of the above-mentioned frosts\r\noccurs, the stone which composes the weir soon becomes incrusted\r\nwith ice, which increases so rapidly in thickness as in a short\r\ntime to impede the course of the stream, which falls over it in a\r\ntolerably uniform sheet, and with considerable velocity; at the\r\nsame time, the wind blowing strongly from the north-west,\r\ncontributes to repel the water and freeze such as adheres to the\r\ncrest of the weir when its surface comes nearly in contact with\r\nthe air. The consequence is that in a short time the current is\r\nentirely obstructed, and the superincumbent water forced to a\r\nhigher level. But as the above-mentioned causes continue to act,\r\nthe ice is also elevated by a perpetual aggregation of particles,\r\ntill by a series of similar operations an icy mound or barrier is\r\nformed, so high as to force the water over the opposite bank, and\r\nthus produce an apparent inundation. But in a short time the\r\naccumulated weight of a great many thousand cubic feet of water\r\npresses so strongly against the barrier as to burst a passage\r\nthrough some weak part, through which the water escapes and\r\nsubsides to its former level, leaving the singular appearance of a\r\nwall or rampart of ice three or four feet high, and about two feet\r\nin thickness, along the greatest part of the upper edge of the\r\nweir. The ice composing this barrier where it adheres to the\r\nstone, is of solid consistency, but the upper part consists of a\r\nmultitude of thin laminae or layers resting upon each other in a\r\nconfused manner, and at different degrees of inclination, their\r\ninterstices being occupied by innumerable icy spiculae, diverging\r\nand crossing each other in all directions. The whole mass much\r\nresembles the white and porous ice which may be seen at the edge\r\nof a pond or small rill where the water has subsided during a\r\nfrost.\r\n\r\nIt may be further observed that a frost of this kind is very\r\nlimited in its duration, seldom lasting more than thirty-six or\r\nforty hours. On the morning of the second day after its\r\ncommencement, a visible relaxation takes place in the temperature\r\nof the atmosphere. Usually before noon, the wind on a sudden\r\nshifts to the south-west, and a rapid thaw comes on, frequently\r\nattended with rain. What appears somewhat remarkable is, that\r\nduring several hours after the commencement of the thaw, the\r\nproduction of ice at the bottom of rivers seems to go on without\r\nabatement, and upon examining a rapid stream, the stones over\r\nwhich it flows will be found at this period completely incrusted\r\nwith the above description of icy plates. It seems evident from\r\nthis that the bed of the river, which has been reduced below the\r\nfreezing temperature, is not for some time affected by the change\r\nof the atmosphere. This may be in some measure illustrated by the\r\nwell-known fact, that rain which falls upon a rock or stone wall,\r\nis frequently converted into ice, though the air and the ground\r\nare evidently in a state of thaw. Before the following morning,\r\nthe ice of which we have been speaking generally disappears, being\r\ncarried away by the current or dissolved by the thaw.\r\n\r\nThe last time that I remarked this phenomenon, was in a stream of\r\nthe river Aire, near Bradford, in Yorkshire, on the 1st of\r\nJanuary, 1814. This instance did not precisely accord with what I\r\nhave stated to be the usual circumstances of the case, as the\r\nfrost then had existed several days without any previous\r\nappearance of this kind; but there were several indications of\r\napproaching change of temperature, and the day following there was\r\na partial thaw attended with rain, the wind having veered from\r\nnorth-west to south-west. This thaw, however, did not continue\r\nlong, and was succeeded by a frost which surpassed all within my\r\nrecollection in severity and duration. Yet during the whole of the\r\nperiod, though the thermometer often stood below 18 degrees\r\nFahrenheit, and the estuary of the Tees several miles below\r\nStockton, where the spring-tides rise from twelve to eighteen\r\nfeet, was for two months frozen over, so as to allow the passage\r\nof a loaded waggon, I could never perceive a particle of ice\r\nadhering to the rock or gravel, in the bed of the small and rapid\r\nriver Leven in Cleveland, where I then resided. This circumstance\r\nseems decisively to prove that the phenomenon does not merely\r\ndepend on an intensity of cold.\r\n\r\nI confess I am unable to frame any hypotheses respecting the\r\nabove-mentioned facts which would not be liable to numerous and\r\nformidable objections. The immediate cause of the formation of the\r\nice seems to be a rapid diminution of the temperature in the stone\r\nor gravel in the bed of the river, connected with the sudden\r\nchanges in the state of the atmosphere, but it does not seem very\r\neasy to explain the precise nature of this connection.\r\n\r\nWe may easily conceive that by a sudden change from a state of\r\nthaw to an intense frost attended by a strong wind, the whole body\r\nof water in a river may become quickly cooled, and consequently\r\ndiminish the temperature of the stone or gravel over which it\r\nflows; but to suppose that water which is not itself at freezing-\r\npoint is capable of reducing the substances in contact with it by\r\nmeans of a continual application of successive particles so far\r\n_beneath_ that temperature as in process of time to convert the\r\ncontiguous water to ice, seems not to accord very well with the\r\nusually received theory of the equilibrium of caloric. However,\r\nthe fact that the quantity of ice thus produced is always greater\r\nin proportion to the superior velocity of the stream, little or\r\nnone being found where there is no sensible current, seems in some\r\ndegree to countenance the above idea.\r\n\r\nI cannot learn that any experiments have ever been instituted on\r\nthis subject, though it seems that they might easily be made by a\r\nperson conveniently situated and possessed of the necessary\r\ninstruments. A careful examination by properly contrived\r\nthermometers of the relative temperatures of the air, the water,\r\nand the bed of the river and of the changes undergone by them\r\nduring the above process, would probably go a great way towards\r\nsolving the problem. I know no one better qualified for this\r\nundertaking than Mr. Knight, if he should at any future time have\r\nleisure and opportunity to direct towards it the same acuteness of\r\nobservation and accuracy of investigation which have enabled him\r\nto make such important discoveries in the economy of the vegetable\r\nkingdom, and if the explanation of this phenomenon should ever\r\nlead to results of any importance to the cause of science, I shall\r\nfeel sufficiently satisfied if it be deemed that I have been of\r\nany service in pointing out the way.\r\n\r\nRICHARD GARNETT.\r\n\r\nBLACKBURN, _May 16th_, 1818.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nGOSSAMER.\r\n\r\nCLITHEROE, _October 20th_, 1859.\r\n\r\nTo the Editor of the \"Field.\"\r\n\r\n\"A Young Inquirer\" asks what is the cause of that appearance so\r\noften met with in the autumn, resembling spider-webs. He says, if\r\nit be the production of that insect, how do you account for their\r\nhanging apparently unsuspended in the air, as it is seen fifty or\r\nsixty feet high, without a tree or any other object near to which\r\nit could be attached?\r\n\r\nI suppose you have not time to give to such questions minutely, as\r\nyour reply would lead one to infer that Gossamer proceeded from\r\nspiders in general; and if it be meant that all true spiders spin,\r\nit is no doubt correct; but the Gossamer which \"A Young Inquirer\"\r\nasks about is the production of a small black spider about the\r\nsize of a flea, which was a true aeronaut long before Montgolfier\r\nor Lunardi, and if \"A Young Inquirer\" has access to either the\r\n\"Linnean Transactions\" or the first series of Loudon's \"Magazine\r\nof Natural History,\" he will find particulars in the latter,\r\nshowing that a violent controversy raged through the three first\r\nvolumes between Mr. Blackwall and Dr. Murray on the question\r\nwhether the ascent of this spider (_A. AEronautica_) was electric,\r\nor whether it merely travelled in the direction of the wind. But\r\nif \"A Young Inquirer\" would deserve his name, let him begin with\r\nthese spiders and observe for himself; he will find the inquiry\r\nhighly interesting.\r\n\r\nHe has no doubt frequently seen a small black spider creeping on\r\nhis hat or clothes (if he lives in the country this must have\r\noccurred to him many times); this is the aeronautic spider. Let\r\nhim take this upon his hand, and if he be in the house let him\r\ncarry it to the open door or window, and allow it to creep up to\r\nthe tip of his finger, which he must then hold in a horizontal\r\nposition. When the spider finds it can proceed no further by\r\ncreeping, it generally drops a few inches, where it remains\r\nsuspended for a short time, apparently quite still, but if very\r\nclosely observed another thread (Gossamer) may be seen proceeding\r\nfrom its vent, and when this has reached the length which the\r\nspider's instinct tells it is sufficient for the purpose, it cuts\r\noff the connection till then existing between it and the thread by\r\nwhich it has hitherto been suspended from the finger, and floats\r\naway into space. Very often it rises almost vertically, sometimes\r\nits course is nearly horizontal, and sometimes it is oblique.\r\n\r\nI cannot say, as Mr. Murray does, that I have seen the spider go\r\n_against_ the wind, neither can I confirm Mr. Blackwall's\r\nassertions that he always goes right before the wind, for I have\r\nseen him go apparently across the current, so far as I could judge\r\nof the direction of the wind at the time.\r\n\r\nIf \"A Young Inquirer\" makes the experiment I have suggested, let\r\nhim not be discouraged if the first he tries does not go off at\r\nall, as I have sometimes found this to be the case, which I\r\naccounted for by supposing that possibly the supply of materials\r\nmight be exhausted at the time.\r\n\r\nI do not remember that I ever saw one of these aeronautic spiders\r\npreying upon any insect, yet it must be for some such purpose that\r\nthey ascend to great altitudes, sometimes in countless numbers,\r\nand the way they come down again is quite as curious as the manner\r\nin which they ascend.\r\n\r\nMany years since, as I was walking over the hills in the\r\nneighbourhood of Blackburn, on a bright, still morning in\r\nSeptember, thousands of small locks of what looked like cotton\r\nwool were slowly descending to the ground from various altitudes--\r\nsome as high as I could see--and tens of thousands of similar\r\nlocks were lying on the ground on both sides of the path by which\r\nI was travelling; and on examination I found that all these locks\r\nwere Gossamer, some with the spider still with them, but generally\r\ndeserted. The spiders when they wanted to come down, finding there\r\nwas no descending current of air, or perhaps, as Mr. Murray says,\r\nno electricity, determined to descend in _parachutes_; they\r\ntherefore had drawn up their cables hand over hand (as they may\r\noften be seen to do when they wish to ascend their own lines)\r\nuntil they accumulated a mass heavy enough to fall by its own\r\nweight, and carry them along with it.\r\n\r\nI have seen Gossamer in this form at other times before and since,\r\nbut in the likeness of a snow-shower I never saw it except on that\r\noccasion, and, if I recollect aright, the same enormous shower of\r\nGossamer was observed to extend as far as Liverpool.\r\n\r\nWhat induced these millions of spiders to go up at the same time,\r\nof course I do not know, and can only suppose that they went up to\r\nfeed; but, as I have said previously, I never saw one of this\r\nspecies preying upon anything. The idea that they go aloft to kill\r\nthe _Furia Infernalis_ is too fanciful to deserve credit. Who\r\nknows whether the _Furia Infernalis_ is anything else than a\r\nmurderous Mrs. Harris--at all events, who has seen one, and what\r\nwas it like?\r\n\r\nI suppose they are true sportsmen, and disdaining to take their\r\nfish in nets, they, like thorough brothers of the angle, fish only\r\n_with fine gut_.\r\n\r\nGilbert White noticed one of these showers of Gossamer, and as his\r\naccount is very interesting, I quote it. He says that on the 21st\r\nof September, 1741, intent upon field diversions, he rose before\r\ndaybreak, but on going out he found the whole face of the country\r\ncovered with a thick coat of cobweb drenched with dew, as if two\r\nor three setting-nets had been drawn one over the other. When his\r\ndogs attempted to hunt, their eyes were blinded and hoodwinked, so\r\nmuch that they were obliged to lie down and scrape themselves.\r\nThis appearance was followed by a most lovely day. About 9 A.M. a\r\nshower of these webs (formed not of single threads, but of perfect\r\nflakes, some near an inch broad and five or six long) was observed\r\nfalling from very elevated regions, which continued without\r\ninterruption during the whole of the day, and they fell with a\r\nvelocity which showed they were considerably heavier than the\r\natmosphere. When the most elevated station in the country where\r\nthis was observed was ascended, the webs were still to be seen\r\ndescending from above, and twinkling like stars in the sun, so as\r\nto draw the attention of the most incurious. The flakes of the web\r\non this occasion hung so thick upon the hedges and trees, that\r\nbasketsful might have been collected. No one doubts (he observes)\r\nbut that these webs are the production of small spiders.\r\n\r\nThese aerial spiders are of two sizes, although of the same colour\r\nand general appearance; they are probably male and female. At all\r\nevents they do not vary in size more than other species of spiders\r\nwhen the sexes differ.\r\n\r\nHas it been observed by naturalists that spiders eat their own\r\nwebs? A large one that I used to feed when I was a lad with wasps,\r\nhumble bees, and flesh-flies, used to do so occasionally. These\r\ninsects were so strong that they often ruined the web in their\r\nefforts to escape, and the spider, quite aware of the rough\r\ncustomers it had to deal with, would often coil a cable of many\r\nfolds round them before venturing to seize them with its\r\nmandibles. It would, if the web was ruined by the struggles of the\r\ninsect, deliberately gorge it, which I accounted for by supposing\r\nthat unless it did so it would not be able to secrete a sufficient\r\nsupply of material to enable it to spin another.\r\n\r\nThe leaping spiders are another curious species, which construct\r\nno webs, although they spin threads. This spider may be seen\r\nfrequently on the walls of houses, and if carefully watched it\r\nwill be seen to range up and down in quest of small gnats and\r\nother insects; when it observes one it creeps to within about two\r\ninches of it, and backing slightly, it appears to hesitate for a\r\nmoment, and then springs upon the fly, but always before doing so\r\nit fixes a thread to the spot from whence it springs, so that if\r\nthe fly happens to be too strong for it, and is able to detach\r\nitself from the wall, they both remain suspended from the thread\r\nwhich has been previously fixed by the spider. This I have seen\r\nmore than once.\r\n\r\nThey sometimes venture on larger game than the small gnats. One I\r\nwas watching one day came upon one of the large _Ephemera_ (the\r\nBrowndrake), an insect ten times as large as the spider, but after\r\nmany points (for the setting of the spider before it springs is\r\nvery similar in manner to that of a thoroughbred pointer [17]), in\r\nwhich it kept varying its position, apparently to gain some\r\nadvantage, it gave up the attempt, discretion proving the better\r\npart of valour.\r\n\r\nWhen botanizing on Erris Begh (in Connemara), this summer, I\r\npassed through many spider-lines so strong as to offer a very\r\nsensible resistance before breaking. I don't remember to have ever\r\nbefore met with them so strong and tenacious, and the makers of\r\noptical instruments might there have found abundance of threads\r\nwhich I am told are valuable as _cross-wires_ for transit-\r\ninstruments and theodolites. I did not meet with any of the\r\nspiders that had thrown out these lines, but judging of them by\r\ntheir works I suppose they must have been large ones.\r\n\r\nOne of your correspondents was inquiring a few weeks since how it\r\nwas that a spider could throw out a long line between two trees or\r\nbuildings at a considerable distance from each other. This seems\r\nto me to be very easily explained, if we reason from the analogy\r\nof the flying spider. The spider seems to throw out a line,\r\ntrusting it will catch somewhere or other, and it is able to\r\nascertain it has done so by pulling at it, and when it finds that\r\nit is firmly fixed it starts off to travel upon it, as I have\r\noccasionally noticed.\r\n\r\nEveryone has noticed how carefully the spider carries her cocoon\r\nof eggs attached to the vent, and how disconsolate she appears to\r\nbe when deprived of them; but I don't think it is so generally\r\nknown that some of the spiders carry their young on their backs\r\nfor some time after they are hatched. I remember seeing an\r\ninstance of this one day when on the Moors, grouse-shooting. I saw\r\nwhat seemed to be a very curious insect travelling on the ling\r\n(heather), and on stooping down to examine it I found it was a\r\nlarge spider, upon the back of which (in fact, all over it) were\r\nclustered some dozens of young ones, about the size of pins'\r\nheads; she also seemed to guard them with great care, and seemed\r\nmuch afraid of losing them.\r\n\r\nFINIS.\r\n\r\nNOTES.\r\n\r\n[1] There is a fish somewhat resembling the Brambling in the\r\nDunsop, a tributary of the Hodder, where it is known by the name\r\nof the Bull Penk.\r\n\r\n[2] My opinion that neither Trout nor Salmon spawn every year is I\r\nthink strongly corroborated by the fact, that previous to the Act\r\nof 1861 the London fish market was supplied with Salmon of the\r\nlargest size, and of the best quality, in October, November, and\r\nDecember. When these fish were examined, it was found that the\r\novaries were but small, and the individual ova were not larger\r\nthan mustard seed. These fish could not have spawned that season,\r\nnor would they have done so if left alive, if the growth of the\r\nova in the ovaries is uniform--I mean if the growth of the ova is\r\nas great in one month as another--because in May and June the ova\r\nin a female Salmon is four times as large as these were in\r\nNovember.\r\n\r\nAgain, when the gas tank at Settle was emptied into the Ribble, in\r\nSeptember, 1861, all the fish so far as was known were killed\r\nbetween that place and Mitton, Salmon as well as Par and Trout.\r\nSupposing that Salmon spawn every year, and that the Smolts come\r\nup the river, as Grilse in the summer of the same year in which\r\nthey have gone to the sea in the spring, there ought to have been\r\na great scarcity of both Grilse and Salmon in the Ribble in the\r\nyear 1862, but so far was this from being the case, that both\r\nGrilse and Salmon were more abundant that season than they had\r\nbeen for some years previously, but there was a scarcity of both\r\nin 1863.\r\n\r\nAgain, when the Smolts were turned out of the breeding ponds at\r\nDohulla, Galway, the experiment was looked upon as a failure\r\nbecause no Grilse returned the same season, not one having showed\r\nitself, but many came the summer after, proving pretty conclusively\r\nthat in some rivers, at all events, the Smolt requires a year's\r\nresidence in the sea before it returns as Grilse.\r\n\r\n[3] In the evidence of Mr. George Hogarth, it is stated that he\r\nsaw upwards of ninety Kelt fish in the mill lead at Grandholme, on\r\nthe Don, May 6th.\r\n\r\n[4] Salmon are said to produce 18,000 or 20,000 eggs each, and I\r\nhave no doubt that a large Salmon will produce more, as one I\r\nexamined a year or two ago, of about ten pounds weight, had a roe\r\nwhich weighed two pounds nine ounces, and the skin in which the\r\neggs were enveloped (they were not in the loose state in which\r\nthey are found just before exclusion) weighed three ounces, after\r\nall the eggs were washed from it; so that there were thirty-eight\r\nounces of eggs. I weighed fifty of them, and found they weighed\r\nsixty-five grains. At that rate, thirty-eight ounces would give\r\n12,788, and 300 lbs. 1,615,000; but as they would be much lighter\r\nwhen dried and potted than when taken from the belly of the fish,\r\nwe may safely estimate that the 300 lbs. would contain 2,000,000,\r\na prodigious number to pass through the hands of one tackle maker\r\nin a season.\r\n\r\n[5] From \"Loudon's Magazine of Natural History.\"\r\n\r\n[6] I have frequently found, when catching Trout for this purpose,\r\nthat the milt and roe were not ready for exclusion; when this was\r\nthe case, I put them into a wire cage, which I sunk in the water,\r\nexamining the fish every week, until I found they were in a fit\r\nstate for the experiment.\r\n\r\n[7] I fancy that if the ova come in contact with the air on\r\nexclusion, they are not so readily impregnated as if they are\r\nalways covered with the water, and therefore I have laid some\r\nstress on the desirableness of keeping the air excluded from the\r\nova as much as possible.\r\n\r\n[8] There is, however, one fact which must lead a casual observer\r\nto suppose that the ova are impregnated twelve months before\r\nexclusion. It is this: the male Par (Salmon fry) are at this\r\nseason, October, full of milt, almost ready for exclusion; whilst,\r\nin the female, the ova are so small that they require a microscope\r\nto see them individually, and the whole ovary is merely like a\r\nthread, leading to the conclusion that either the milt of the male\r\nis not required for the female Par, or the ova are impregnated\r\ntwelve months before exclusion. The fact is, that the milt of the\r\nPar is used to impregnate the ova of the Salmon on the spawning\r\nbeds.\r\n\r\n[9] When I commenced this paper I had no doubt that hybrids had\r\nbeen produced between the Sprod (sea Trout) and the common Trout;\r\nsince then, having seen the fry said to be so produced, and on\r\nmaking some further inquiries, I find there is some doubt whether\r\nthe female was a _Sprod_, or merely a white Trout, and therefore I\r\ncannot confidently assert (as some time ago I believed I could)\r\nthat hybrid fish had already been produced. As some of my readers\r\nmay not know what a _Sprod_ is, it may be necessary to explain. In\r\nthe Ribble we have a fish ascending from the sea in July and\r\nAugust, weighing from six to ten ounces, which, in appearance at\r\nleast, is a miniature Salmon. I believe the same fish is called a\r\nWhitling in Scotland. Besides this, we have a similar but larger\r\nfish, which begins to come a little earlier, and which weighs from\r\none to three pounds; this, in the Ribble, is called a Mort (in\r\nScotland a sea Trout). Both these fish (if they are two species)\r\nafford splendid sport to the angler, who must never consider them\r\nbeaten until he has them in the landing-net. They are also\r\ndelicate eating.\r\n\r\n_Note on cross-breeding of Fish._\r\n\r\nSince the above paper was published, the breeding of Hybrids has\r\nbeen successfully accomplished. I have had fish sent from two\r\ndifferent gentlemen living on the banks of the reservoirs\r\nbelonging to the Liverpool Waterworks; these were beautiful fish\r\n(three in number), more like the sea Trout than the Salmon, and\r\nthe largest of them weighing two pounds. I had put them into the\r\nbrooks running into the reservoirs three years before.\r\n\r\nI also learn from a friend that a beautiful specimen of the _ombre\r\nChevalier_ (French Char) was taken out of the Rivington reservoir.\r\nAbout a thousand had been put there by me two years before.\r\n\r\n[10] Persons conversant with the habits of birds will readily\r\ncomprehend me; for the sake of those who do not, I will just\r\nobserve that the flight of all the Wagtails is very peculiar,\r\nbeing a succession of great leaps in the air (if I may be allowed\r\nthe expression), which form a series of curves, the bird rising\r\nconsiderably at the commencement of each effort, and sinking again\r\nat the close.\r\n\r\n[11] The intrepid and unfortunate traveller Joseph Ritchie, who\r\naccompanied Captain Lyon's expedition to Fezzan, and died there in\r\n1819. Mr. Ritchie was a native of Otley, and an intimate friend of\r\nMr. Garnett and his brothers. The beautiful poem from which the\r\nquotation is taken is printed in Alaric Watts's \"Poetical Album.\"\r\n\r\n[12] 1853.--I regret that in 1853, and for some years previous, we\r\nhave not seen one. I fear they are extinct. The smaller kind are\r\nstill numerous.\r\n\r\n[13] The male Par is an exception to this rule.\r\n\r\n[14] It appears to be a beautiful provision of Nature that mixture\r\nwith water should increase the sphere of its action. Spallanzani\r\nfound by actual experiment that three grains of the seed of a male\r\nfrog might be diluted with a pint of water without destroying its\r\nstimulating power.
