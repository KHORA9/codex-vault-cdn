PAUL HUDSON\r\n\r\nJamestown, Virginia\r\n\r\nIllustrated by Sidney E. King\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVirginia 350th Anniversary Celebration Corporation\r\nWilliamsburg, Virginia\r\n1957\r\n\r\nCopyright©, 1957 by\r\nJ. Paul Hudson, Jamestown, Virginia\r\n\r\nJamestown 350th Anniversary\r\nHistorical Booklet Number 23\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the pages which follow only a few of many goods and commodities made,\r\ncollected, or grown at or near Jamestown during the seventeenth century\r\nwill be discussed. No pretense is made to do more than touch lightly on\r\nthe ones mentioned most frequently by the early settlers. With the\r\nexception of tobacco, grape vines, and herbs, agricultural products are\r\nomitted.\r\n\r\nJamestown has never received proper recognition as the place where many\r\nAmerican industries were born in the New World. Few people are aware\r\nthat boatbuilding, timbering, glassmaking, tobacco-cultivation,\r\nwine-making, iron-smelting, and the making of pitch, tar, potash and\r\nsoap-ashes, were carried on in Virginia's colonial capital; nor is it\r\ngenerally known that there was production of pottery, bricks and tile,\r\nof considerable volume.\r\n\r\nBesides the products mentioned in this booklet, attempts were made to\r\ngrow or produce other items at or near \"James Citty\"--including cordage,\r\nsilk-grass, dyes, salt, flax, hemp, alum, white earth, walnut-oil,\r\nminerals, sweet-gums, madder, sugar cane, cotton, citrus fruits, olives,\r\nbark, roots, and berries. A few brought profits to the planters while\r\nothers, like indigo, cotton, sugar cane, and citrus fruits, resulted in\r\nfailure. The tropical plants from the West Indies could not, of course,\r\nwithstand the cold Virginia winters.\r\n\r\nAttempts made by the early planters to find commodities and raw\r\nmaterials revealed to a large degree the industrial and agricultural\r\nresources of the new colony. The lessons learned at Jamestown--even\r\ninformation derived from the failures--were invaluable ones. For from\r\nthe successful activities carried out in the small huts, in the fields,\r\nand in the woodland areas, would later develop industries and\r\nagricultural pursuits undreamed of by the early settlers.\r\n\r\nThe history of American commodities, like the history of the nation,\r\nis no longer a brief one. Three hundred and fifty years have now passed\r\nsince the first adventurous Englishman, with musket in hand and ears\r\nalerted to the sound of moccasined feet, searched the wilderness area up\r\nand down the James River for New World wealth. As time permitted, he\r\nworked in his small shop making utilitarian things out of clay, wood,\r\nsand, and metal--objects not entirely lacking in beauty. Busy as he was\r\nwith these tasks, he still found time to tend his small vineyard and\r\ntobacco field. As he worked he may have dreamed of the day when his\r\nhogs-heads of sweet-scented tobacco and casks of red wine would reach\r\nEngland safely and be sold for a profit. Trying to better his condition\r\nin a new land, he never dreamed that the seeds of his incessant labors,\r\nwhich he was unconsciously planting, would some day flower into a great\r\nindustrial and agricultural nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n  Introduction                       iii\r\n\r\n  Boatbuilding                         1\r\n\r\n  Timbering                            4\r\n\r\n  Barrels and Casks (Coopering)        8\r\n\r\n  Potash and Soap-Ashes               11\r\n\r\n  Pitch and Tar                       14\r\n\r\n  Iron                                16\r\n\r\n  A Jamestown Blacksmith Shop         18\r\n\r\n  Glassmaking                         23\r\n\r\n  Furs and Hides                      26\r\n\r\n  Building                            30\r\n\r\n  Tobacco                             40\r\n\r\n  Wine                                42\r\n\r\n  Silk                                46\r\n\r\n  Pottery                             48\r\n\r\n  Metalworking                        52\r\n\r\n  Fishing                             56\r\n\r\n  Brewing                             60\r\n\r\n  Herbs and Medicinal Plants          64\r\n\r\n  Furniture                           68\r\n\r\n  The Box-Maker and Turner            71\r\n\r\n  Carriages and Wheeled Vehicles      72\r\n\r\n  Spinning                            73\r\n\r\n  Bread-Baking                        74\r\n\r\n  \"Harvesting\" Ice                    76\r\n\r\n  A Happy Home in Jamestown           77\r\n\r\n  Selected Bibliography               78\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOATBUILDING\r\n\r\n\r\nOn April 27, 1607, the day after the Jamestown colonists landed at Cape\r\nHenry, some of the settlers began to build or assemble a small boat.\r\nGeorge Percy, one of the original colonists, reported that it was\r\ncompleted and launched on April 28.\r\n\r\nIt appears, therefore, that 350 years ago--on the sandy beach near Cape\r\nHenry--the Jamestown bound colonists made their first important\r\ncommodity by hand in the New World.\r\n\r\nContemporary records reveal that many small boats were built at\r\nJamestown from the earliest years of the settlement. They afforded the\r\nbest means of transportation through the uncharted wilderness, and were\r\nused for fishing, trade, and exploration.\r\n\r\nThe conjectural illustration shows colonists building a small boat at\r\nJamestown Island--near Back River--about 1650.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Research on painting by author. _Photo courtesy National\r\nPark Service._\r\n\r\nBoatbuilding At Jamestown Over 300 Years Ago\r\n_Conjectural Painting_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo courtesy National Park Service._\r\nBoatbuilding Tools Unearthed at Jamestown\r\nAll tools in the picture were hand wrought during the seventeenth\r\ncentury. Some may have been forged at Jamestown.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTIMBERING\r\n\r\n\r\nTimbering was one of the first activities undertaken by the Jamestown\r\ncolonists and was one of the first English industries in America. The\r\nday the settlers arrived they began cutting down trees, for timber was\r\nneeded to build their fort and town as well as to export to the mother\r\ncountry. Thomas Studley, a member of the first colony, reported that\r\nclapboards were made for loading on the ships which were to return to\r\nEngland:\r\n\r\nNow falleth every man to worke, the Councell contrive the fort, the rest\r\ncut downe trees to make place to pitch their tents; some provide\r\nclapboard to relade the ships, some make gardens, some nets, &c.\r\n\r\nCaptain Newport left Jamestown in June, 1607 and aboard his two ships\r\nwere clapboards and other wooden products.\r\n\r\nThe virgin forests growing in the vicinity of Jamestown furnished\r\nplanks, masts, clapboard, wainscoting, and other wooden products needed\r\nby the mother country. As England had run short of timber and was paying\r\nexorbitant prices to European countries for naval stores and timber\r\nproducts, the supply furnished by the Jamestown colony helped greatly to\r\nrelieve the situation. The Virginians were also helped, for timber was\r\none of the few products which brought profits to the struggling colony.\r\n\r\nThe conjectural painting shows settlers carrying out timbering\r\nactivities at Jamestown. Some of the piled up lumber will be used in the\r\ncolony, some will be shipped to England.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Research on painting by author.

Later, when tobacco and other crops were grown\r\nsuccessfully--and a few commodities were produced in Virginia for\r\nexport--barrels, casks, and other wooden containers were made by the\r\ncooper in large numbers.\r\n\r\nJohn Lewes was the first cooper to reach Jamestown, arriving in January,\r\n1608. Others followed him throughout the seventeenth century; and for\r\nalmost a hundred years their craft was an important one in the \"Capital\r\nCittie.\"\r\n\r\nThe illustration shows a cooper and his helpers making barrels and\r\ncasks at Jamestown, about the year 1625.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Research on painting by author.

A\r\ncooper's shop at Jamestown may have been somewhat similar to the one\r\nshown.\r\n\r\nFrom _Orbis Sensualium Pictus_ by Johann Comenius (London, 1685).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOTASH AND SOAP-ASHES\r\n\r\n\r\nSoap-ashes and potash were among the first commodities produced by the\r\nEnglish in America. Potash was made from soap-ashes (wood ashes,\r\nespecially those obtained from burning ash and elm) and was used at\r\nJamestown for making both soap and glass. Soap-ashes were exported to\r\nEngland as early as 1608, and throughout the remainder of the century it\r\nappears that both potash and soap-ashes were shipped to the mother\r\ncountry, As early as 1621 soap-ashes were selling for six shillings to\r\neight shillings per hundred weight, whereas potash was bringing between\r\nthirty-five shillings and forty shillings per hundred weight.\r\n\r\nAlthough few contemporary records are available which mention the profit\r\nmade from the sale of soap-ashes and potash by the Virginia planters, it\r\nis known that some small returns were made from time to time throughout\r\nthe seventeenth century. While tobacco was the important money-making\r\ncrop, the part played in the economy of the Jamestown settlement and\r\nenvirons by other commodities--including soap-ashes and potash--should\r\nnot be overlooked.\r\n\r\nIn the conjectural picture Jamestown settlers are shown making potash.\r\nFive steps were necessary:\r\n\r\n     1. A pile of firewood (billet-wood) was burned until grey ashes\r\n     were formed. The best woods were oak, ash, poplar, hickory, elm,\r\n     hazel, and beech. Old hollow trees, if not dead, were especially\r\n     desirable.\r\n\r\n     2. After several pounds of ashes had accumulated, they were leached\r\n     (boiling water was percolated through the ashes), resulting in a\r\n     very strong alkali solution known as ley or lye.\r\n\r\n     3. The alkali solution (or ley) was strained through a coarse linen\r\n     cloth to keep out any coarse materials (such as small pieces of\r\n     half-burnt wood), that might happen to remain in the ashes.\r\n\r\n     4. The strained ley solution was poured in an iron pan, and\r\n     evaporated over a quick fire--almost to dryness.\r\n\r\n     5. The residue remaining in the bottom of the pan was removed and\r\n     put into an iron pot. The pot was put over a strong fire till the\r\n     matter was melted. Immediately the melted matter was poured out upon\r\n     an iron plate, where it soon cooled and appeared in the form of a\r\n     solid lump of potash.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Making Potash at Jamestown--About 1608\r\n_Conjectural sketch_]\r\n\r\nTo a chemist the somewhat primitive methods described are very obvious\r\nones in making an impure form of potash. The combustion of hardwoods\r\nresulted in an ash residue containing the desired potassium carbonate.\r\nSome purification was obtained by leaching the ash residue in boiling\r\nwater and then filtering the \"ley\" through a coarse linen cloth. The\r\nfiltered \"ley\" was evaporated in an iron pot to dryness. The potash\r\nresulting was now ready for making soap and glass, as well as for other\r\nindustrial uses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPITCH AND TAR\r\n\r\n\r\nPitch and tar--used by shipbuilders from time immemorial for caulking\r\nand covering seams of vessels--were made at Jamestown as early as 1608.\r\nAfter the second supply ships reached Jamestown in October, 1608, one of\r\nthe settlers wrote:\r\n\r\nNo sooner were we landed, but the President dispersed [as] many as were\r\nable, some for glasse, others for pitch, tarre, and sope ashes.\r\n\r\nA month later trials of pitch and tar were carried to England by Captain\r\nChristopher Newport, as reported by Thomas Studley, one of the original\r\nplanters:\r\n\r\nCaptaine Newport being dispatched with the tryals of pitch, tarre,\r\nglass, frankincense and sope ashes, with that clapbord and wainscot\r\n[which] could bee provided ... returned for England.\r\n\r\nAs pitch and tar were made in Virginia throughout the seventeenth\r\ncentury, mainly for exporting to England, it appears that the colonists\r\nmade some profit from the sale of such products.\r\n\r\nPitch and tar were obtained from pine trees, one of the common trees in\r\nthe Tidewater Virginia woods. Tar is an oily, dark colored, product\r\nobtained in the destructive distillation of pine wood. In Virginia it\r\nwas commonly made from the resinous roots and wood of various pines. The\r\nwood was heaped into a conical stack depressed at the center, covered\r\nwith earth, and fired. The tar ran into a hollowed-out place in the soil\r\nbeneath the stack of wood. Pitch was a dark-colored viscous substance\r\nobtained as a residue in distilling pine tar, and widely used for\r\ncaulking seams of boats.\r\n\r\nIt is of interest that the early settlers named the large swamp north\r\nof the town area \"Pitch and Tar Swamp.\" Undoubtedly the large pine trees\r\nwhich bordered the swamp were used for making pitch and tar, as well as\r\nturpentine and resin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Making Tar At Jamestown From Pine Wood\r\n_Conjectural sketch_]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIRON\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is possible that small amounts of iron were smelted at Jamestown in\r\nearth ovens or Catalan-type furnaces during the early years of the\r\ncolony. In 1955 archeologists unearthed a circular-shaped pit which\r\ncontained charcoal, burned oyster shell, iron ore, pieces of smelted\r\niron, and slag. It is known that some iron was made in earth ovens in\r\nEngland during the early years of the seventeenth century, where iron\r\nwas smelted in holes dug in the ground. The fires were fed with logs and\r\ncharcoal, and the heat was increased by use of large foot bellows. The\r\nsame method may have been used at Jamestown; or it is possible that the\r\n\"earth oven\" may have been used for hardening bar iron imported from\r\nEngland, as much bar iron received from the mother country was very soft\r\nand unsatisfactory for making tools.\r\n\r\nThe conjectural sketch shows Jamestown colonists making iron in a\r\nprimitive earth oven or furnace.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Small Quantities Of Iron May Have Been Made At Jamestown\r\nDuring The Early Years Of The Settlement\r\n\r\n_Conjectural sketch_]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA JAMESTOWN BLACKSMITH SHOP\r\n\r\n\r\nA blacksmith, James Read by name, was a member of the first group of\r\ncolonists who planted the Jamestown settlement in 1607. Perhaps he\r\nhelped forge the small chisels which Captain John Smith mentioned\r\n(writing of the month of September, 1607):\r\n\r\nAs yet we have no houses to cover us, our tents were rotten, and our\r\ncabbins worse than nought: our best commoditie was iron which we made\r\ninto little chissels.\r\n\r\nMany small chisels have been unearthed at Jamestown, and one may wonder\r\nwhether any were made during the hard autumn of 1607, when the state of\r\nthe new colony was at such a low ebb.\r\n\r\nAnother early Jamestown blacksmith was Richard Dole, who arrived on the\r\nsupply ship _Phoenix_, April 20, 1608. Read and Dole were the vanguards\r\nof many ironworkers who emigrated to Virginia at various periods of time\r\nthroughout the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\nIn 1955 archeologists discovered the site of an early seventeenth\r\ncentury forge or smithery near historic Jamestown church. Large\r\nquantities of slag were unearthed together with pieces of bar iron,\r\nweapons, tool fragments, and several partially-completed iron handles,\r\nchisels, and nails. A few blacksmiths' tools and a small anvil were also\r\nfound. Associated cultural material found indicated that the forge\r\noperated between 1610 and 1625, and there was good evidence that it may\r\nhave been located in an armourer's shop. The forge site appears to be\r\nthe oldest one used by the English which has been discovered in America.\r\n\r\nThe sketch showing the Jamestown blacksmith at work is based on a 1685\r\nengraving by Johann Comenius.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Jamestown Blacksmith Working In A Forge Shop\r\n_Conjectural sketch_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo courtesy National Park Service._\r\nIron Objects Excavated At Jamestown Near The Site Of An Early\r\nSeventeenth-Century Forge\r\n\r\nShown are blacksmiths' tools, bar iron, sword guards, slag, and a few\r\nincomplete iron objects. It appears that the forge, located a short\r\ndistance west of historic Jamestown church, was in operation as early as\r\n1625.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Indian Massacre At Falling Creek, March 22, 1622\r\n                       _Conjectural sketch_\r\n\r\nIn 1620-21 the Jamestown colonists established an iron furnace at\r\nFalling Creek--about eighty miles upriver from Jamestown. It was the\r\nfirst ironworks built in America by Englishmen, and the furnace was the\r\nfirst one (of which there is definite record) in which iron was smelted.\r\nThe contemporary records also indicate that a few tools were made in the\r\nforge shop. The enterprise was short-lived, however, for in 1622 the\r\nIndians massacred the ironworkers and their families and destroyed the\r\nfurnace. Although never rebuilt, its importance cannot be overstressed,\r\nfor the Falling Creek site can rightfully claim the honor of being the\r\nbirthplace of the American iron industry.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Black-Smith.\r\n\r\nThe Black-Smith 1 in his Smithie (or Forge) 2 bloweth the fire with a\r\npair of Bellows, 3 which he bloweth with his Feet, 4 and so heateth the\r\nIron; And then he taketh it out with the Tongs 5 layeth it upon the\r\nAnvile, 6 and striketh it with a Hammer, 7 where the Sparks 8 flie off.\r\nAnd thus are hammered out Nails 9, Horshoos 10, Cart-strakes 11, Chains\r\n12, Plates, Locks and Keys, Hindges, &c.

When Captain\r\nChristopher Newport sailed for England a few weeks later he carried with\r\nhim \"tryals of pitch, tarre, glasse, frankincense, sope ashes; with that\r\nclapboard and waynscot that could be provided.\" It is not known what\r\nkinds of glass were taken to England by Newport. John Smith, writing of\r\nthe year 1609, stated: \"... wee made three or foure lotts of tarre,\r\npitch, and sope ashes; produced a tryall of glass....\" Again, the\r\nrecords do not reveal what kinds of glass were produced.\r\n\r\nIn 1621 six Italian glassmakers arrived at Jamestown, and during the\r\nnext three years attempts were made to manufacture glass, but it appears\r\nthat only small amounts were blown.\r\n\r\nOddly enough, archeological excavations did not disclose what kinds of\r\nglass were made at Jamestown during the two ventures. When the\r\nglasshouse site was excavated in 1948 only small fragments and\r\ndrippings--dark green in color--were found. It appears that the tiny\r\nfragments could have been pieces from window panes, bottles and vials,\r\nand simple drinking glasses. No glass beads were found at or near the\r\nfurnace site.\r\n\r\nThe conjectural sketch shows a Jamestown glassblower at work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Making Glass At Jamestown In 1608\r\n_Conjectural sketch_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo courtesy National Park Service._\r\nArtifacts Relating To Glassmaking--Found Near The Site Of The Jamestown\r\nGlasshouse\r\n\r\nIn the picture are shown a small melting pot, part of a working hole,\r\nfragment from a large melting pot, cullet (the broken or refuse glass in\r\nthe lower left corner), and green glass fragments (lower center and\r\nlower right)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFURS AND HIDES\r\n\r\n\r\nShortly after the Jamestown colony was planted the English adventurers\r\nexplored the rivers and bays in the vicinity of the settlement, visited\r\nmany Indian villages, and traded colorful articles to the natives in\r\nexchange for foods, furs, and other commodities.\r\n\r\nThe first exploring party left Jamestown a week after the establishment\r\nof the colony. Twenty-four of the settlers sailed up the James River as\r\nfar as the falls, a distance of about ninety miles. At Arahatteak (near\r\npresent-day Richmond) the explorers gave the Indians \"penny knyves,\r\nsheeres, belles, beades, glass toyes &c....\" for mulberries, wheat,\r\nbeans, tobacco, and a \"crowne which was of deares hayre, dyed redd.\"\r\nBefore leaving the village Captain Newport presented the Indian chief\r\nwith a hatchet and a red waistcoat.\r\n\r\nOn the return trip to Jamestown the exploring party visited other Indian\r\ntowns on the James River, including one whose chieftain was Powhatan's\r\nbrother--the wily and crafty Opechancanough. Gabriel Archer, a member of\r\nthe group, recorded that the chief's \"kyngdome is full of deare (so also\r\nis most of all the kyngdomes:) he hath (as the rest likewise) many ryche\r\nfurres.\"\r\n\r\nMany of the early settlers listed the fur-bearing animals that inhabited\r\nthe dense woods near Jamestown. George Percy, an original planter,\r\nobserved that:\r\n\r\nThere is also great store of deere both red and fallow. There are\r\nbeares, foxes, otters, bevers, muskats, and wild beasts unknowne.\r\n\r\nJohn Smith, in one of his early books describing Virginia (_A Map of\r\nVirginia, With a Description of the Country_, Oxford, 1612), gives brief\r\ndescriptions of deer, squirrels, opossums, muskrats, bears, beavers,\r\notters, foxes, and others. With the exception of bears, these\r\nfur-bearing animals still inhabit Jamestown Island--protected by the\r\nNational Park Service.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Jamestown Settlers Trading With The Indians\r\n_Conjectural sketch_\r\n\r\nFor inexpensive beads and trinkets the colonists received furs, foods,\r\nand other commodities from the aborigines]\r\n\r\nIt appears that early in the century some profit was being made from the\r\nsale of furs in England, for Thomas Studley, who was in charge of the\r\nfirst storehouse at Jamestown, wrote that \"one mariner in one voyage\r\nhath got so many [furs] as he confessed to have solde in England for\r\n£30.\"\r\n\r\nWilliam Strachey, who lived at Jamestown in 1610-1611, described a\r\ntrading expedition made by Captain Samuel Argall in 1610:\r\n\r\nWithin this river, Captayne Samuell Argoll in a smale river which the\r\nIndians call _Oquiho_. Anno 1610. trading (in a bark called the\r\nDiscovery) for corne, with the great king of _Patawomeck_, from him\r\nobteyned well neere 400. bushells of wheat, pease and beanes (besyde\r\nmany kind of furrs) for 9. powndes of copper, 4. bunches of beades, 8\r\ndozen of hatchetts, 5 dozen of knives, 4 bunches of bells, 1. dozen\r\nSizers, all not much more worth than 40_s._ English....\r\n\r\nIt is evident, therefore, that the Jamestown colonists who traded their\r\ncolorful beads and trinkets to the woodland Indians in exchange for food\r\nand other commodities--including furs and hides--were the pioneer\r\nEnglish fur traders in the New World. The experiences which adventurers\r\nlike Christopher Newport, John Smith, and Samuel Argall had with the\r\ncunning Virginia aborigines were just as exciting and stirring as those\r\nshared by the hardened trappers and traders who searched the Rocky\r\nMountain streams for beaver two hundred years later. The hunt for furs\r\nwhich began at Jamestown in 1607 did not diminish until the western\r\nboundary of the United States had expanded to the shores of the Pacific\r\nOcean during the middle of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo courtesy National Park Service._\r\nObjects Found At Jamestown Which Were Used For Trading With The Indians\r\nShown are glass beads, bell fragments, a hatchet, scissors, knives, and\r\nan incomplete brass pan.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBUILDING\r\n\r\n\r\nThe day the colonists landed at Jamestown, May 14, 1607, they began\r\nbuilding a triangular-shaped fort (\"a pallizado of planckes and strong\r\nposts, foure foote deepe in the ground, of yong oakes, walnuts, &c.\"), \"a\r\nsetled streete of houses,\" a church, a guardhouse, and a storehouse. It\r\nis apparent that all men familiar with tools and building skills were\r\nextremely busy during the first few weeks, especially the four\r\ncarpenters in the group (William Laxon, Edward Pising, Thomas Emry, and\r\nRobert Small), two bricklayers (John Herd and William Garret), and mason\r\n(Edward Brinto). As brick houses were not built at Jamestown until about\r\n1625, the bricklayers who came to Virginia with the first group of\r\ncolonists undoubtedly aided the carpenters. Perhaps it was they who made\r\nthe first stone footings and mud and stick chimneys for the frame houses\r\nwhich were built inside the fort.\r\n\r\nAs timber was plentiful in Virginia during the early years of the\r\nsettlement, most of the houses were of frame construction. During the\r\nfirst decade or two house construction reflected a primitive use, not of\r\nmaterials brought from England but those that were found ready at hand,\r\nsuch as saplings for a sort of framing, use of branches, leafage, bark\r\nand animal skins. During these early years, when the settlers were\r\nhaving a difficult time staying alive, mud walls, wattle and daub, and\r\nmarsh grass thatch of a coarse sort were used. Out of these years of\r\nimprovising the construction with squared posts, later with quarterings\r\n(studs), came into practice. There probably was little thought of\r\nplastering walls during the first two decades, and when it was done,\r\nclay, or clay mixed with oyster shell lime, was first used. The early\r\nfloors were of clay, and it should be remembered that clay floors\r\ncontinued to be used in the humbler dwellings throughout the seventeenth\r\ncentury. It can be assumed that most of the dwellings, or shelters, of\r\nthe Jamestown settlers, certainly until about 1630, had the primitive\r\nappearance of \"settlers\" houses, and were rough on the exterior.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Landing May 14, 1607.\r\n\r\nThe day the colonists landed at Jamestown (May 14, 1607) they began\r\nbuilding a triangular-shaped fort (\"a pallizado of planckes and strong\r\nposts, foure foote deepe in the ground, of yong oakes, walnuts, &.\"), \"A\r\nsetled streete of houses,\" a church, a guardhouse, and a storehouse\r\n_Conjectural sketch_\r\n\r\nFrom _A Pictorial Story of Jamestown Virginia: The Voyage and Search for\r\na Settlement Site_, by J.

A coarse marsh grass thatch covers the roof\r\nand rough clapboards cover the sides of the building.

The shed and recessed nook in front of the\r\noven are covered with red earthenware pantiles. Jamestown has taken on a\r\ndegree of permanency, and many of the Colonists are realizing small\r\nprofits from the sale of tobacco.]\r\n\r\nAfter the settlement had become fairly well established the colonists\r\nbegan building a few brick houses. In the picture English artisans are\r\nshown erecting a small brick structure at Jamestown about the year 1630.\r\nIt is quite clear from the documentary records and the archeological\r\nremains that the colonists not only made their own bricks--and probably\r\nmany of their roofing tiles--but that the process, as well as the\r\nfinished product, followed closely the English tradition.\r\n\r\nAn old account, relating to brick-making in England three hundred years\r\nago, is summarized:\r\n\r\n1. Before Christmas we begin to dig the earth and let it lie to mellow\r\ntill Easter.\r\n\r\n2. Then we water the earth well and temper it with a narrow spade.\r\n\r\n3. The moulder cuts off a piece of earth, throws it into the mould made\r\nof beech, levelling it off with a wooden implement called a strike.\r\n\r\n4. The carrier carries the mould to the drying ground, where he adroitly\r\nturns it over, laying the bricks on the ground, and lifts up the mould.\r\n\r\n5. When the bricks are dry, they carry them to a place where they row\r\nthem up like a wall. They are covered with straw, till they are dry\r\nenough to be carried to the kiln.\r\n\r\n6. Then they are stacked in the kiln, a fire kept till they are at the\r\ntop red fire hot.\r\n\r\n7. Then we let them cool, and sell them as we can for as much money as\r\nwe can get, but usually about 13 or 14 shillings the thousand.\r\n\r\nSimilar methods may have been used at Jamestown during the seventeenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Building A Small Brick House At Jamestown, About 1630\r\n_Conjectural sketch_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Making Brick At Jamestown About 1650\r\n_Conjectural sketch_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo courtesy National Park Service._\r\nOverall View Of Brick Kiln Unearthed at Jamestown\r\nIn addition to bricks, flat roofing tiles were found in this\r\nkiln--placed there for firing with the bricks. Four brick kilns were\r\ndiscovered at Jamestown during archeological explorations.]\r\n\r\nIn order to build brick houses lime was needed by the bricklayers and\r\nplasterers for making plaster and mortar. Contemporary records reveal\r\nthat \"lymeburners\" emigrated to Jamestown as early as 1610. As four lime\r\nkilns were found during archeological excavations, it is evident that\r\nthe lime used by the Jamestown builders was made on the historic island.\r\nIn the kilns oyster shells from the James River were burned and\r\nconverted into lime by the limeburners.\r\n\r\nThe unearthing of large quantities of plaster and mortar at Jamestown\r\nindicates that the majority of the brick houses (as well as many frame\r\nstructures) had plastered walls and ceilings, especially after 1635.\r\nSome plaster excavated had been white-washed while other bore its\r\nnatural whitish-gray color. All plaster and mortar found was made from\r\noyster shell lime, sand, and clay.\r\n\r\nOrnamental or decorative plaster was found near a few of the house\r\nfoundations. The plasterwork, decorated in raised ornamental designs,\r\nwas used for enhancing the beauty of both the interior and exterior of a\r\nbuilding. Designs on the plaster included Roman numerals, letters,\r\nmottos, crests, veined leaves, rosettes, geometric patterns, a lion, and\r\na face or mask. Many fragments of moulded plaster cornices were also\r\nrecovered. Broken oyster shells are distinguishable in the ornamental\r\nplasterwork, indicating that the pargetting was made at Jamestown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Making Lime From Oyster Shells, About 1625\r\n_Conjectural sketch_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo courtesy National Park Service._\r\nOrnamental Plaster Made At Jamestown\r\nArcheological explorations revealed that ornamental plaster was used on\r\na few Jamestown buildings--for enhancing the beauty of both the exterior\r\nand interior.

It was a bitter tasting leaf of rather poor quality, and never\r\ncultivated on a large scale by the early planters.\r\n\r\nAbout 1611, seeds of a West Indies tobacco plant, _Nicotiana tabacum_,\r\nwere introduced into Virginia. A year later John Rolfe experimented with\r\nthe seeds from the West Indies plant, together with tobacco seeds from\r\nSouth America. The exact nature of Rolfe's tests, carried on at or near\r\nJamestown, is unknown, but the plant he seemingly developed was one with\r\na mild, sweet-scented, leaf.\r\n\r\nThe new sweet-scented leaf became popular overnight, and during the\r\nremainder of the seventeenth century it proved the economic salvation of\r\nthe colony. To a large degree, the new crop determined the economic,\r\nsocial, and political life of the planters. The demand in England for\r\nthe new leaf was also responsible, in a large measure, for the spread of\r\nsettlement and increase of population in Virginia. The tobacco plant\r\ndeveloped by Rolfe was the first crop grown by the Virginia settlers\r\nwhich made a profit.\r\n\r\nThe conjectural illustration shows Jamestown colonists harvesting\r\ntobacco about the year 1650.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Research on painting by author.

The reasons\r\nseemed to have been twofold: first, to make money for the Virginia\r\nCompany, whose stock-holders had invested much capital in the new\r\ncolony; and secondly, to insure the mother country a steady flow of\r\ninexpensive wine--which was impossible as long as continental merchants\r\ncharged exorbitant prices for wines sent to England. Then, too, if wine\r\ncould be made successfully in Virginia, the people living in the new\r\nsettlement would profit accordingly.\r\n\r\nVineyards were planted on Jamestown Island at various periods of time\r\nduring the seventeenth century, and quantities of good wines were made,\r\nbut far too often inferior wine was fermented. Because of the long sea\r\njourney from Virginia, casks of good wine sent to England frequently\r\narrived in a spoiled condition.\r\n\r\nAfter 1675 the hope of producing good Virginia wine for export purposes\r\nwaned. During the last ten years of the century, when Jamestown\r\ndeclined, the vineyards were neglected, fell prey to deer and the\r\nelements, and soon became engulfed in the wilderness.\r\n\r\nThe illustration shows a man and woman pressing grapes at Jamestown\r\nabout 1650. The woman is trampling them, whereas the man is using a\r\nprimitive grape press.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Research on painting by author.

In 1610 Francisco Maguel, who had spent eight\r\nmonths in Virginia, wrote that \"There grow in that country [Virginia]\r\nwild many forest grapes, of which the English make a wine that resembles\r\nmuch the wine of Alicante, according to the opinion of the narrator who\r\nhas tasted both.\"]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Vintage. _Vindemia._\r\n\r\nWine groweth in the Vine-yard 1, where Vines are propagated, and tied\r\nwith Twigs to Trees 2, or to Props 3, or Frames 4.

Most of it was purchased from the\r\nMediterranean countries--France, Italy, and Spain. Some was imported\r\nfrom the Near East, and small amounts from the Orient were bought from\r\nDutch sea captains. As extremely high prices were being paid for the\r\nprecious cloth, the Virginia Company decided to experiment with silk\r\nculture in the new colony.\r\n\r\nSilk was made at Jamestown during the seventeenth century, but the\r\nenterprise seldom brought profit to the planters. The majority of the\r\ncolonists had to struggle to grow crops and produce goods with which\r\nthey were familiar, and were reluctant to experiment with a commodity\r\nwhich required a special skill that they did not possess. A few\r\nsettlers, however, made serious efforts to raise silkworms, and at times\r\nsmall quantities of silk were made and shipped to England.\r\n\r\nThe silk-making venture died a hard death, but the large mulberry trees\r\nwhich still grow in many places in Tidewater Virginia (perhaps scions of\r\nseventeenth century ones) are reminders of a day when a few Virginia\r\ncolonists fed and nurtured silkworms and \"wound off\" silk thread onto\r\nprimitive wooden reels.\r\n\r\nIn the conjectural illustration a woman is drawing silk thread from the\r\ncods; the man is winding the thread on a wooden reel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Research on painting by author.

A kiln site was uncovered in 1955, and nearby were found\r\noverfired pots, misshaped vessels, and mis-glazed pieces--undoubtedly\r\nfrom the \"waster\" pile. Also found near the kiln site were two complete\r\npots, and hundreds of fragments from local-made vessels which were used\r\nin the colony between 1625 and 1650--indisputable evidence that crude,\r\nutilitarian, lead-glazed earthenware was made at Jamestown during the\r\nseventeenth century.\r\n\r\nAlthough made for everyday use, many of the pieces unearthed at the\r\nJamestown kiln site are symmetrical in form and not entirely lacking in\r\nbeauty. One can easily see that the craftsman took pride in shaping the\r\npieces, as three centuries later the crude wares are still pleasing to\r\nbehold.\r\n\r\nThe Jamestown potter, indeed, was no young apprentice or mere farmer who\r\npotted on the side. The potter's art, then as now, was a highly\r\nspecialized one, rooted in a long tradition. Our potter was an artisan,\r\ntrained in the mysteries of a medieval craft, and it was probably he who\r\nfirst transplanted his ancient skills to the Virginia wilderness.\r\n\r\nThe conjectural illustration shows a Jamestown potter shaping a vessel\r\non his crude kick wheel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Research on painting by author.

With them were two refiners and a\r\njeweler. Although John Smith wrote that these artisans \"never had\r\noccasion to exercise their craft,\" it is possible that they made a few\r\nsmall objects of silver, pewter, and latten metal (a brass-like alloy).\r\n\r\nIn spite of the fact that few specimens of silver and pewter were found\r\nat Jamestown, seventeenth century records and inventories indicate that\r\nmany Virginia families owned such wares, including cups, beakers,\r\ndishes, salts, salvers, tankards, porringers, bowls, and plates.\r\n\r\nA pewterer who lived thirty miles from Jamestown--Joseph Copeland by\r\nname--made the oldest dated piece of American pewter which has been\r\nfound. In the 1930's, National Park Service archeologists, working at\r\nJamestown, recovered the significant specimen--an incomplete pewter\r\nspoon which is a variant of the trifid or split-end type common during\r\nthe 1650-1690 period. Impressed on the handle, in the trefoil finial of\r\nthe stem is the mark of the maker, giving his name, the Virginia town\r\nwhere he worked, and the year he started business. The matchless spoon\r\nbears the sole surviving \"touch\" or mark of an American pewterer of the\r\nseventeenth century. The complete legend, encircling a heart, reads:\r\n\"IOSEPH COPELAND/1675/CHUCKATUCK.\" (Chuckatuck is a small Virginia\r\nvillage located about thirty miles southeast of Jamestown.) Copeland\r\nlater moved to Jamestown, and as he worked in the statehouse from\r\n1688-1691 he may have made pewter in Virginia's capital \"Citty.\"\r\n\r\nThe conjectural sketch shows a Jamestown metalworker making spoons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Making Pewter Spoons At Jamestown About 1675 _Conjectural\r\nsketch_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n_Photo courtesy National Park Service_\r\n            A Unique Pewter Spoon Handle Found At Jamestown\r\nThe rather commonplace and incomplete spoon fragment illustrated is\r\nsignificant for many reasons. Its prime importance is that it is the\r\noldest known pewter object of American manufacture. The mark on the\r\nhandle is the sole surviving one of an American pewterer of the\r\nseventeenth century. The mark reveals that the spoon was made in 1675 by\r\nJoseph Copeland, who worked at Chuckatuck, Virginia (located thirty\r\nmiles southeast of Jamestown).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n_Photo courtesy National Park Service._\r\n             Items Left At Jamestown By Early Metalworkers\r\nThe brass weights, ingot of scrap brass, and silver spoon shown, which\r\nwere unearthed at Jamestown, are reminders of a bygone day when\r\nmetalworkers made beautiful things in Virginia's colonial capital over\r\nthree centuries ago. Contemporary records indicate that many\r\nmetalworkers emigrated to Virginia during the seventeenth century.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFISHING\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the first settlers planted their small colony at Jamestown the\r\ntidewater rivers and bays teemed with many kinds of fish and seafood.\r\nVarieties which soon appeared on the colonists' tables included\r\nsheepshead, shad, sturgeon, herring, sole, white salmon, bass, flounder,\r\npike, bream, perch, rock, and drum; as well as oysters, crabs, and\r\nmussels.\r\n\r\nThe day after the colonists reached Virginia, April 27, 1607, George\r\nPercy observed that the oysters were large and tasty:\r\n\r\nWe came to a place where they [the Indians] had made a great fire, and\r\nhad beene newly a rosting oysters. When they perceived our comming, they\r\nfled away to the mountaines, and left many of the oysters in the fire.\r\nWe eat some of the oysters, which were very large and delicate in taste.\r\n\r\nThe following day, April 28, Percy noted that some of the oysters had\r\npearls:\r\n\r\n... we got good store of mussels and oysters, which lay on the ground as\r\nthicke as stones. Wee opened some, and found in many of them pearles.\r\n\r\nThe Jamestown planters who wrote accounts of the new colony commented on\r\nthe abundance and variety of fish and shellfish in the rivers and creeks\r\nnear the \"capital citty.\" It seems rather surprising, therefore, that so\r\nmany colonists died during the first autumn \"of meere famine,\" as\r\nreported by Percy, when the James River teemed with fish, oysters, and\r\ncrabs.\r\n\r\nCaptain Gabriel Archer, Gentleman, mentioned a seven foot sturgeon which\r\nwas caught on June 13, 1607: \"Our Admiralls men gatt a sturgeon of 7\r\nfoote long which Captayne Newport gave us.\" George Percy commented on\r\nthe excellence of the sturgeon in the James River:\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n_Photo courtesy National Park Service._\r\n                Fishhooks, Fish-gigs, Lead Net-Weights\r\nThe artifacts shown were excavated at Jamestown. These objects and many\r\nothers found, are reminders of a day when fish and shellfish lived in\r\nabundance in every creek, river, and bay, in Tidewater Virginia.]\r\n\r\nThere are many branches of this river, which runne flowing through the\r\nwoods with great plentie of fish of all kindes; as for sturgeon, all the\r\nworld cannot be compared to it....\r\n\r\nJohn Smith and William Strachey also listed the delicious and palatable\r\nvarieties of fish and shellfish which were found in Virginia waters,\r\nrevealing that seafood was an important source of food for the\r\ncolonists. At times, especially during the early years, it was one of\r\nthe main sources.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Repairing Nets At Jamestown About 1620\r\n_Conjectural sketch_\r\nSeafood was an important food for the early colonists. At times,\r\nespecially during the first years of the settlement, it was one of the\r\nmain foodstuffs.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBREWING\r\n\r\n\r\nOne seventeenth century building unearthed at Jamestown appears to have\r\nbeen used as a place where beer, ale, brandy, and other alcoholic\r\nbeverages were made. Nearby were found pieces of lead, which may have\r\nbeen part of a lead cistern which held barley, and inside the building\r\nwere three brick ovens, which may have been used for drying malt. A\r\nhandle from a copper kettle was discovered near one of the ovens, and\r\npieces of copper and lead pipes were recovered not far from the\r\nbuilding.

It is believed that most of the beer and ale brewed at\r\nJamestown after 1620 was made by the common brewer. One act, passed in\r\n1620/21 \"for the repressinge of the odious ... sinne of drunkenesse,\"\r\nstated that \"noe person ... shall at any tyme ... brewe anie beere or\r\nale, and sell the same againe in his or her house ... unless it bee in\r\ntownes where there is noe comon brewer.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHERBS AND MEDICINAL PLANTS\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong commodities which the early Jamestown settlers searched for were\r\nherbs and medicinal plants. It is possible that Thomas Wotton and Will\r\nWilkinson, surgeons with the first colony, were the first members of the\r\nEnglish medical profession to collect and experiment with New World\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nThe few colonists who wrote of their travels in Virginia frequently made\r\nmention of the herbs and native plants. George Percy related that five\r\ndays after the settlers had planted their colony at Jamestown, May 19,\r\n1607, that \"One of the savages brought us on the way to the wood-side,\r\nwhere there was a garden of tobacco and other fruits and herbes.\"\r\n\r\nOn an exploring trip upriver from Jamestown in late May, 1607, Gabriel\r\nArcher recorded that \"One [savage] shewed us the herbe called in their\r\ntongue _wisacan_, which they say heales poysoned woundes, it is like\r\nlyverwort or bloudwort.\"\r\n\r\nJohn Smith mentioned the spring herbs, though he did not know their\r\nnames: \"Many _hearbes_ in the spring time there are common dispersed\r\nthroughout the woods, good for brothes and sallets, as violets, purslin,\r\nsorrell, &c. Besides many we used whose names we know not.\"\r\n\r\nThe first supply, approximately 120 settlers, reached Jamestown in\r\nmidwinter and early spring, 1608. Among the group was a physician, Dr.\r\nWalter Russell; a surgeon, Post Ginnatt; and two apothecaries, Thomas\r\nFeld and John Harford. There is no record, however, indicating that\r\nthese men used Virginia plants and herbs for medicinal purposes.\r\n\r\nThe man who first made intensive experiments with native plants was\r\nDoctor Lawrence Bohun. Arriving at Jamestown in 1610, he is mentioned\r\nseveral times by William Strachey, who also reached Jamestown in 1610,\r\nin _The Historie of Travell into Virginia Britania 1612_:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Doctor Lawrence Bohun Experimenting With Herbs At\r\nJamestown, 1610\r\n\r\n_Conjectural sketch_]\r\n\r\nThere groweth in the Island of James-towne a smale tree of leaves, armes\r\nand fruict, like the myrtle-tree, the fruict thereof hath a tast with\r\nthe mirtle, but much more bynding, these trees grow in great plentye,\r\nrownd about a standing pond of fresh water in the middle of the Island;\r\nthe pill or rynd whereof is of so great force against inveterate\r\ndissentericall fluxes of which Doctor Bohoune made open experiment in\r\nmany of our men labouring with such diseases and therefore wisheth all\r\nsuch phisitians as shall goe thither to make use thereof.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1610 the Virginia Company of London instructed the colonists\r\nto send the following plants to England: sassafras, bayberries, \"poccone\r\nto be gotten from the Indians,\" \"galbrand [galbanum] groweth like\r\nfennell,\" sarsaparilla, and walnut oil. Other plants, both native and\r\nexotic, which were cultivated at Jamestown for medicinal purposes\r\nincluded mastic, woodbine, senna, snakeroot, dittany, mechoacan,\r\npepper-wort, Jamestown (or Jimson) weed, wild cherry, and rhubarb.\r\n\r\nMost of the herbs which were cultivated in English gardens grew\r\nsuccessfully in Virginia, especially the ones listed in John Gerard's\r\n_The Herbal_ (London, 1597), and William Lawson's _The Country\r\nHousewifes Garden_ (London, 1617). Many contemporary records reveal that\r\nseveral herbs were used for medicinal purposes as well as for improving\r\nthe flavor of certain foods and beverages.\r\n\r\nA few herbs still grow on Jamestown Island, and together with the\r\nnative sassafras, bayberry, wild bergamot, and bee balm, they remind us\r\nthat the wilderness physicians, surgeons, and apothecaries did\r\neverything in their power to keep the English settlers alive and well\r\nthree centuries ago.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo courtesy National Park Service_\r\n            Items Used By Jamestown Doctors And Apothecaries\r\nThe drug jars, ointment pot, vials, and mortar and pestle fragments\r\nremind us that physicians, surgeons, and apothecaries experimented with\r\nherbs and native plants three centuries ago--attempting to keep the\r\nJamestown colonists alive and well.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFURNITURE\r\n\r\n\r\nVirginia in the seventeenth century was a woodsman's paradise, and there\r\nis every reason to believe that most of the furniture used in Jamestown\r\nhouses was made by colonial cabinetmakers. In the forests grew\r\nmagnificent specimens of oak, walnut, pine, cypress, cedar, maple, and\r\nmany other varieties; and although contemporary records are scanty, it\r\nis believed that the \"James Citty\" furniture makers made skillful use of\r\nsuch woods. William Strachey, who reached Jamestown in 1610, wrote that\r\nthe church furniture was made of cedar and black walnut:\r\n\r\nIt [the church] is in length threescore foote, in breadth twenty foure,\r\nand shall have a chancell in it of cedar, and a communion table of blake\r\nwalnut, and all the pewes of cedar, ... a pulpet of the same, with a\r\nfont hewen hollow, like a canoa....\r\n\r\nIn spite of the fact that few records exist regarding the kinds of\r\nfurniture made in the seventeenth century by Virginia cabinetmakers, the\r\npieces extant reveal that the English styles were followed closely.\r\nWhile it is true that the wealthy planters imported some ornamented\r\nfurniture from London, much of their furniture was made on the\r\nplantations. It is believed that practically all furniture used by the\r\nyeomen settlers was locally made.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Jamestown Cabinetmaker At Work\r\n_Conjectural sketch_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo courtesy National Park Service._\r\nTools Unearthed At Jamestown Which Were Used by Coopers, Carpenters, And\r\nFurniture Makers\r\n\r\nShown are gouges, augers, chisels, bits and hammers; an adze,\r\nhewing-axe, punch, race-knife, scriber, and wedge.

If they needed a thing they usually\r\nhad to make it with their own hands or do without. These homemade\r\nobjects--including cloth, pottery, tools, woodenware, furniture, brick\r\nand tiles, and many household accessories--were well-made and extremely\r\npractical.
