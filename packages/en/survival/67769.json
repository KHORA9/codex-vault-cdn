After an experience\r\nwith bees dating almost from childhood, and a careful study of all\r\nworks published on the subject of bees, and the journals devoted to\r\nthat particular branch of rural affairs, I find _theory, guess-work,\r\nprejudice and selfish motives_ are so prevalent, as to confuse and\r\ndiscourage the _beginner_, and finally, all who are seeking after\r\ninformation by which they may make bee keeping a source of profit, and\r\nwho wish to adopt a correct and scientific system of bee management.\r\n\r\nIn my early efforts at bee keeping, I met with many failures and heavy\r\nlosses, from being confused by the contradictory teachings of selfish\r\nor ignorant bee keepers, and from a lack of that personal knowledge\r\nwhich experience, and a close study of the nature and habits of bees\r\nhas now placed in my possession. After many unsuccessful experiments,\r\nand careful investigation, and a close study of the natural habits and\r\ninstincts of bees, I have succeeded in inventing a hive and new system\r\nof bee management which completely changes the whole process of bee\r\nkeeping, and renders the business _safe_, _pleasant_ and _profitable_.\r\n\r\n_The hive and system of bee management recommended in these pages is\r\nentirely original with me, and is not patented._ I invented the hive\r\nand plan of management for my own use, as I am engaged in raising\r\nhoney for market, and wish every swarm of bees I keep to produce the\r\ngreatest possible amount of surplus honey, and in the most convenient\r\nand attractive marketable form. I am induced to place this work before\r\nthe public at the earnest and oft repeated requests of friends and\r\ncorrespondents. The work has been hurriedly written, as I had but\r\nlittle spare time to devote to this matter, consequently sentences are\r\nnot all, perhaps, grammatically arranged. I have made the beautiful of\r\nsecondary importance to the useful. I have endeavored, however, to make\r\nmy statements so clear as to be readily understood and comprehended by\r\nevery person of intelligence, although he may be wholly unacquainted\r\nwith bee keeping.\r\n\r\nEvery person, who has a farm or garden, should keep bees, at least one\r\nor more swarms, to furnish honey for the use of the family. There is no\r\ngreater luxury than nice honey in clean snow-white comb in nice glass\r\nboxes, such as is produced by my new system of bee management. This\r\nbest of all sweets is now within reach of every one who has a plot of\r\nground large enough to set a hive of bees upon.\r\n\r\nAfter bees are once located in my hives but very little expense is\r\nrequired to keep them in proper condition, so that they will give a\r\ngood quantity of nice box honey every year.\r\n\r\nUnder the old methods of bee keeping, bees required a great deal of\r\ncare and attention, especially during the summer season. And then the\r\nwinters were very destructive to them, many often losing their entire\r\nstock; or if they were not a total loss, they were so damaged by the\r\nwinter as to be of no profit, and two severe winters in succession were\r\nquite sure to finish them.\r\n\r\nThis was very discouraging, and many have abandoned bee keeping,\r\nentirely discouraged.\r\n\r\nOn my plan a complete revolution is effected in bee management, as will\r\nbe shown in this work.\r\n\r\nThere is in my opinion no pursuit which offers greater inducements\r\nthan bee keeping, especially to women. There are _very many_ who are\r\nconfined indoors nearly the whole time, excluded from the air and\r\nsunshine, to the great injury of their health; and after this great\r\nsacrifice they barely succeed in obtaining a livelihood. To such,\r\nbee keeping offers great inducements, such as improved health, and\r\na handsome recompense for all labor performed. I am acquainted with\r\nmany who have commenced bee keeping on my plan, who are meeting with\r\ncomplete success. A lady bought a swarm of Italian bees of me in 1874,\r\nand she writes me that from that _one_ she increased her stock to over\r\ntwenty swarms the third season; besides she got over one hundred pounds\r\nof _nice_ honey from the swarm I sent her the _first season_. Here I\r\nwish to be clearly understood; I do not wish to hold out inducements\r\nwhich will never be realized, for the purpose of causing any one to\r\ncommence bee-keeping; yet I believe bee keeping on correct principles\r\nshould be encouraged, until bees enough are kept to collect all the\r\nhoney now allowed to go to waste, and which if collected by bees and\r\nstored in nice glass boxes, would add millions of dollars to the wealth\r\nof the country.\r\n\r\nSince the day I introduced my Controllable Hive and new system of\r\nbee management to the notice of the public, the worthless bee hive\r\nswindlers and their tools have been boiling over with wrath against me,\r\nlying and slandering me through the public journals, and especially\r\nthrough the Bee Journals, and all because, that I, a woman, had\r\nsucceeded in inventing a bee hive and new system of bee management\r\nsuperior to anything yet produced, and which was fast coming into use\r\non its merits among bee keepers; consequently the sale of other hives\r\nwas _decreasing_ in the same proportion. I first perfected the hive\r\nand system of management for my own use, with no thought of making it\r\npublic, but through the kindness of my personal friends, and others\r\nwho have visited me to enquire into the new system, it has become known\r\nfrom Maine to Oregon, and adopted by many of the most intelligent bee\r\nkeepers in the United States. And in compliance with that command in\r\nthe good book which reads--\"_Let your light shine_,\" I am determined to\r\nspread the truth, regardless of all opposition from the ignorant and\r\nselfish crowd which is constantly attacking me.\r\n\r\nWithout egotism I claim a thorough knowledge of the habits and\r\ninstincts of bees. Consequently I claim a thorough knowledge of the\r\nrequisites of a hive, and all fixtures pertaining to it, as well as a\r\nknowledge required to make bee keeping successful and profitable; and\r\nall this has been acquired in the school of _experience_ and _practice_.\r\n\r\nKind reader, I respectfully submit the following pages, and ask for\r\nthem a candid and unprejudiced consideration. Read _carefully_ and\r\n_understandingly_, and apply to bee keeping, and I feel certain you\r\nwill realize many times the cost of this book in the increased profits\r\nof your bees, managed as here directed.\r\n\r\nThe statements herein set forth are the result of many years _practical\r\nexperience with bees_ with a view of making the raising of honey for\r\nmarket profitable, and the general management of bees successful.\r\n\r\n                                                 MRS. LIZZIE E. COTTON.\r\n\r\nWest Gorham, Maine, Aug. 5th, 1880.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n                              HONEY BEES.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: QUEEN BEE.]\r\n\r\n\r\nA SWARM of bees contains _one_ Queen, thousands of workers and in the\r\nsummer season a limited number of drones. The queen is the only fully\r\ndeveloped female in the swarm. She never leaves the hive except on two\r\noccasions--when leading a swarm, and when but a few days old, to meet\r\nthe drone, or male bee, in the air, for the purpose of fecundation. It\r\nappears from close observation that only one impregnation is operative\r\nduring life, as old queens have never been known to leave the hive for\r\nthat purpose.\r\n\r\nThe natural life of the queen averages from four to six years.\r\nQueens sometimes become entirely barren before death; at other times\r\nthe eggs of old queens are found to produce only drones. No matter\r\nwhether deposited in drone cells, or worker cells, the progeny will\r\nbe drones invariably. When drones are reared in worker cells they\r\nwill be very much dwarfed in size, notwithstanding the worker bees'\r\nattempt to overcome the difficulty, by lengthening the worker cells, to\r\naccommodate the monstrosities.\r\n\r\nThe queen has a sting, yet she may be handled with impunity, for she\r\nwill not use it except when in deadly combat with a rival queen. She\r\nreceives the most marked attention from all members of her family;\r\ndeprive a swarm of their queen, and they will, as soon as the loss is\r\nknown, manifest the greatest agitation and alarm, and if the swarm is\r\none just hived, and only a few hours from the parent stock, they will\r\nall return at once to the old home. They appear to fully realize the\r\nvast importance of a mother, and that with no means to supply her place\r\nthey must soon perish; and to avoid their impending fate they return\r\nto the old hive. With old stocks deprived of their queen the result is\r\ndifferent, as will be shown further on. Every one who keeps bees should\r\nstrive to become familiar with the appearance of the queen, that they\r\nmay be able to recognize her at a glance among thousands of workers,\r\nas it will often be necessary to look her up in my new system of bee\r\nmanagement. In looking for the queen in full hives, she is usually\r\nfound on the brood combs, unless in opening the hive she may have been\r\nfrightened, and taken refuge in some hiding place, as the corner of the\r\nhive, at the bottom ends of the comb-frames, or some similar hiding\r\nplace. After we become familiar with her appearance and movements we\r\nare able to find her quite readily, even when the hive is crowded with\r\nbees.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WORKER BEE.]\r\n\r\nThe worker bee is much smaller than the queen. On the worker devolves\r\nall the labor of the swarm. They collect honey, pollen or bee bread,\r\nand propolis, or bee glue. The workers produce wax from honey, and from\r\nthe wax they build comb, in which to store the honey and bee bread\r\nthey collect, for their own use in time of need. Wax is produced from\r\nhoney, as butter is produced from milk. Bees do not collect wax, but\r\nthey collect honey, which by a natural process in the stomach of the\r\nbee is changed, and exudes from between the rings of the abdomen in\r\nminute scales of wax, which is detached by the bee and moulded into\r\ncomb. The worker bee possesses a sting, and is ever ready to make\r\nuse of it in defending home and treasure. This is a wise provision\r\nof nature, for were it otherwise, the other insect and animal tribes\r\nwould appropriate the treasures of the bee--honey, wax, &c., and this\r\nindustrious little insect would soon become extinct.\r\n\r\nThe worker bee possesses an instinct but little inferior to reason in\r\nthe human family. A few examples will show their wonderful instinct:\r\nTwenty hives of bees, placed in a row, but a few inches distant one\r\nfrom the other, all of like size, shape and color; the bees to our\r\nperception _exactly_ alike, no difference in size, shape, color or\r\naction;--yet every bee of this vast number (which at some seasons of\r\nthe year would amount to more than six hundred thousand bees) in these\r\ntwenty hives knows its own hive, and if let alone will not enter any\r\nother, except it be for the purpose of securing the honey therein for\r\nits own use, or in other words to plunder and rob its neighbor. There\r\nis no intercourse between swarms--each is a separate colony governed\r\nby a queen. If through mistake the subjects of one enter the domain\r\nof another, a war of extermination is commenced at once. To test\r\nthis point, I changed two hives so that they were reversed, the one\r\noccupying the place of the other. This was done while the bees were out\r\ncollecting honey in a warm day. The first bees that entered the hive\r\nwere instantly killed, and this was kept up until the hives were set in\r\ntheir proper places. The ground in front of the hives was covered with\r\nhundreds of dead bees. A bee is killed almost _instantly_ by the sting\r\nof another.\r\n\r\nThe young bee on its first excursion from the hive does not leave its\r\nhome without precaution. With a view to a safe return, it turns its\r\nhead towards its home, rises slowly on the wing, at first describing a\r\ncircle of only a few inches in diameter, as it recedes slowly backward,\r\nseeming to so mark every object surrounding the hive as to enable it to\r\nreturn and enter, without the slightest danger of entering any other\r\nhive. Bees in Spring, in their first flight, mark their location in\r\nthis manner. After the location has been thus marked, the bees leave\r\nthe hive in a direct line, and return by their way-marks, with perfect\r\naccuracy and regularity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DRONE BEE.]\r\n\r\nThe drone bee is a clumsy fellow. The drones are the male bees. Where\r\na dozen or more hives are kept, there is no necessity for more drones\r\nthan one swarm would naturally rear, yet each one of the twelve swarms\r\ncarries out its natural proclivities, and rears a large number of these\r\nuseless consumers, not one in a thousand of which is ever of any use.\r\nSwarms should not be permitted to rear a large number of these non\r\nproducers. A few are indispensable, yet we should take this matter into\r\nour own hands. Not one drone in five thousand ever fulfils the purpose\r\nfor which it was created. Fifty drone cells is enough for one hive, and\r\nwhen more than this number is constructed (sometimes they will number a\r\nthousand or more in a hive) cut out all but a very few, and fit in a\r\npiece of worker comb in their place--it is more profit to raise workers\r\nthan drones. Drones leave the hive, to sport in the sunshine in large\r\nnumbers, every fine afternoon in June and July. When on the wing they\r\nmake a very loud, coarse buzzing. They have no sting and may be handled\r\nwithout the least fear.\r\n\r\nWhen the honey season is over, the worker bees drive out the drones,\r\nand a prosperous swarm will not tolerate a drone in the hive through\r\nthe winter.\r\n\r\nIn September I have seen a quart or more of drones clustered together\r\nnear the entrance of the hive, from whence they had been driven by the\r\nbees. The workers on guard about the entrance of the hive, would not\r\nlet one pass into the hive, though they were constantly making the\r\nattempt. As soon as one would approach the entrance to the hive to\r\npass in, a half dozen or more workers would seize him, and drag him\r\nstruggling to the edge of the platform and pitch him off, at apparent\r\ngreat danger to his portly and clumsy body.\r\n\r\nI wish to impress strongly on the minds of all who adopt my plan of bee\r\nmanagement, the great importance of cutting out all the drone cells,\r\nexcept a very few in every hive. Don't leave _more than_ fifty, half\r\nthat number will do. After you have once cut out the surplus drone comb\r\nand fitted in worker comb, there is no further trouble with an excess\r\nof drones from that hive. It takes a great deal of honey to rear a\r\nlarge brood of drones, and still more to support them in idleness two\r\nor three months.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HONEY CELL--WORKER CELLS--QUEEN CELLS]\r\n\r\nThis engraving represents a section of comb in a miniature comb frame,\r\ncontaining all the different cells found in a hive. At the top are\r\ncells for storing honey. At the extreme right, near the bottom, is a\r\nqueen cell complete, as it appears in queen raising, or in one week\r\nafter a swarm has been deprived of its queen, in a full stock, or as\r\nit is found in stocks that swarm naturally, at the time the _first_\r\nswarm issues. Though often found in different places on the comb, and\r\noften to the number of a half dozen or more in one stock or hive, yet\r\nits relative position is _always the same_. It will always present the\r\nsame appearance, whether at the edges or on other parts of the comb.\r\nNear the queen cell is seen the worker cells, _containing brood_ in all\r\nstages of growth, from the tiny egg just deposited by the queen, to the\r\nfull-grown grub, or young bee. Near the worker cells, at the bottom,\r\nare the empty drone cells.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Breeding.\r\n\r\nThe natural increase of the honey bee is very imperfectly understood\r\nby the great majority of bee keepers. Very many suppose that young\r\nbees are raised only in the warm summer months, and their ideas of the\r\n_modus operandi_ of increase are exceedingly vague. I find that strung\r\nstocks have maturing brood nearly every month in the year--have found\r\nbrood in stocks in December and January.\r\n\r\nThe queen lays all the fertile eggs in the swarm; consequently all\r\nincrease is dependent on her. I say the queen lays all the _fertile_\r\neggs, because occasionally under certain circumstances we find eggs\r\nlaid by workers, but under my observation such eggs never mature.\r\nEgg-laying workers are known to be such, by eggs being found in stocks\r\nthat have been deprived of their queen, and the means of rearing\r\nanother. This is one of the wonders of nature, of which no satisfactory\r\nsolution has been given. The points established as to the sex of bees\r\nare these: the queen is a fully developed female; the drones are fully\r\ndeveloped males; the worker,--_what is it?_ The worker is said by\r\nsome to be neuter. If this last is true, how are the eggs produced?\r\nOthers say the worker is a female with generative organs _not fully\r\ndeveloped!_ A pretty nice point--to credit them with the power to\r\nproduce eggs, without imparting vitality sufficient to germinate.\r\n\r\nWe will leave this knotty question, as it is of no consequence in the\r\npractical management of bees for profit. Suffice it then to say, the\r\nqueen is the mother of the entire family, and without a queen no swarm\r\nof bees can long\r\n\r\nThe time taken to perfect the three different kinds of bees, queen,\r\nworker and drone, varies slightly. The queen will mature in about\r\nsixteen days from the time the egg is deposited in the cell. The drone\r\nand worker each in about twenty days. This time is subject to some\r\nvariation, governed by the weather, and number of bees in the hive,\r\nwhich causes the temperature of the hive to be greater or less. A high\r\ntemperature will forward, while a low temperature will retard, the\r\nmaturing of the brood.\r\n\r\nSwarms with healthy prolific queens increase rapidly through the spring\r\nand summer. The queen at this season will deposit from one thousand to\r\nfifteen hundred eggs per day. Some writers estimate higher. To secure\r\nso large a number of eggs, and consequent increase of bees, we must\r\nhave healthy prolific queens to start with, and offer every available\r\nfacility to encourage the desired increase. How to do this successfully\r\nis shown further on.\r\n\r\nIf we wish to secure a good harvest of honey, we must have the bees to\r\ncollect it, and we must have them at the proper time, viz: _when the\r\nharvest is ready_. To do this we must encourage breeding to the utmost\r\nin _early spring_.\r\n\r\nEarly in the spring the queen enlarges the circle containing the brood;\r\nperhaps, if the stock was very strong, and everything favorable, she\r\nlaid a few eggs in one or two combs near the center of the cluster of\r\nbees in January. Perhaps the cells occupied at that time were less\r\nthan a dozen, all compact together in a circle, occupying less space\r\nthan the size of a silver half dollar. As she progresses, this circle\r\nis enlarged, and the cells on the opposite side of this comb is used;\r\nthen the next comb and so on, at the same time enlarging the circle,\r\nkeeping the brood _compactly together_, so that the bees, by clustering\r\naround it, can keep up the required warmth to forward to maturity the\r\nbrood. As the young bees hatch, the queen proceeds with her duties of\r\nlaying eggs, until every brood cell is occupied, and as fast as a bee\r\nmatures and leaves its cell, she is on hand with an egg to occupy the\r\nvacant place. This is kept up without cessation till swarming time,\r\nwhen the hive becomes crowded with bees, then, as preparation for\r\nswarming, the queen deposits eggs, from which the bees by a special\r\ncourse of treatment, rear queens. When they are sealed over, as shown\r\nin the plate, the old queen leaves the hive with the _first_ swarm to\r\nseek a new home. In about ten days the young queens hatch and lead out\r\nafter-swarms--second, third, etc. When swarming is over, the strongest\r\nqueen destroys the others, and reigns over the old swarm till another\r\nswarming season. This is the process in natural swarming; on my plan we\r\nimprove upon the process, as will be shown in the proper place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n                     THE CONTROLLABLE BEE HIVE AND\r\n                     NEW SYSTEM OF BEE MANAGEMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nIT is now nearly ten years since I perfected the Controllable Bee Hive\r\nand New System of Bee Management. I commenced bee keeping with the\r\ncommon box hive, with no knowledge whatever, of the habits of bees. I\r\nwas not long in learning that I could not make bee keeping a success\r\nwith the box hive, and I also found that the _thousand and one_ patent\r\nhives were no better, and the great majority of such hives, _inferior_\r\nto the simple box hive. I found there was no practical method of\r\ncontrolling the swarming propensities of bees. All such hives would\r\nswarm or not, as seemed to suit the caprice of the bees, which I found\r\nvery perplexing. Stocks under the old plan of management, sometimes\r\nshow every indication of swarming, such 'as clustering out, etc., yet\r\nthey adhere pertinaciously to the old stock through the entire summer,\r\na peck or more of them clustering idly on the outside of the hive,\r\nthrough the season; and if one put on boxes, it is all the same, they\r\nwill do nothing. And such swarms often starve early the next winter,\r\nafter passing the summer in idleness. Other stocks with apparently not\r\nso many bees will swarm several times; often swarm so much as to reduce\r\nthe number of bees so low that the bee moth will effect its destruction\r\nduring the summer; there not being bees enough to protect the combs\r\nfrom the attacks of this destructive little insect. This swarming\r\nproblem I found very difficult to solve. There were so many conflicting\r\ntheories, I found I could gain no positive, reliable information from\r\nany source, to aid me, and that I must solve the problem by practical\r\nexperiment.\r\n\r\nExperience is a good teacher, but often a very costly one. Some told\r\nme if I wished to prevent swarming, I must cut out the queen cells,\r\nwhich the bees constructed preparatory to swarming. This was simply\r\nimpossible, with the box hive, sol constructed a hive with movable\r\nframes, so the bees, could build their combs in the frames, and each\r\ncomb of the hive could be lifted out separately. But when I attempted\r\nto prevent swarming by cutting out the queen cells, I found if T was\r\nto thwart nature in that way, I had, to say the least, a big job on my\r\nhands. I could cut out the queen cells, but within twenty-four hours\r\nafter I had done this, the bees would have others constructed, and be\r\nready to swarm, and as I kept cutting, they would keep building. They\r\nhad the advantage of numbers and position, and when I opened the hive\r\n_every day_ and destroyed such, to them, important work, they were not\r\nlong in declaring and proclaiming me to be an enemy to them, and they\r\nwould attack me whenever occasion offered. I soon found that if not\r\n_impossible_ it was certainly _impracticable_ to prevent bees swarming\r\nby cutting out the queen cells. It was a surprise to me that this plan\r\nshould be recommended by bee keepers claiming to be well skilled in bee\r\nmanagement. After proving this plan of no value, I was told if I would\r\ncontract the entrance to my hives so the queen could not pass, I could\r\nthereby successfully prevent swarming, as the swarm would not leave\r\nwithout the queen. This looked to me like a very _nice_ operation, to\r\nsay the least, in fact, _more nice than wise_. However, I determined to\r\ntest the plan. I accordingly contracted the entrance to my hives, and\r\nlo! the _drones_ being larger than the queen _they could not pass!_\r\nso they clustered about the entrance, and in their efforts to get out,\r\ncompletely blocked up the passage, so the workers could not pass. Yet\r\nthis plan of contracting the entrance was claimed to be protected by\r\n_letters patent of the U. S._ I found this plan for preventing swarming\r\nof no value whatever. Very many other plans were tendered me and\r\ntested with like results. I was all this time pushing my experiments,\r\nand learning something from experience every day. I was determined to\r\narrange and construct a hive which would render bee keeping successful\r\nand profitable, and I can say at the present time, my labors have been\r\nrewarded with success.\r\n\r\nI ought to go on and write out a description of all the old methods of\r\nbee keeping, and all the patent bee hive humbugs, with the thousand\r\nand one _non_-patent hives and fixtures, got up expressly to swindle\r\nbee keepers out of their hard earnings, by a class of rascals, many of\r\nwhom never owned a swarm of bees, and who care not one cent whether\r\nbee keeping is a success or otherwise, if they can pocket a round\r\nsum by their fraud. Were I to write out minutely these points, this\r\nwork would become too voluminous and extended; besides it would be of\r\nno _practical_ value to the bee keeper, who wishes to keep bees for\r\nprofit. I will not, therefore, give such minute descriptions of all the\r\nold systems, hives, etc., but will confine myself more closely to such\r\npractical information as will be of value to the bee keeper.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Swarming Controlled.\r\n\r\n_How to control swarming_ is truly an important question. I believe\r\nthat the successful controlling of swarming is the key to success and\r\nprofit in bee keeping. Now how shall we do it? I will tell you. But\r\nfirst a few preliminary words. If swarms are desired, we arrange in\r\nearly spring to have them issue in the swarming season, and at such a\r\ntime as will best suit our convenience. When no swarms are wanted, we\r\nturn the whole force of bees to storing surplus honey in small glass\r\nboxes, throughout the entire season, and have no swarms, yet have the\r\nsame increase of bees that would be gained if they swarmed. Then all\r\nthe bees work at storing honey in boxes, instead of swarming out; and\r\nto any one who has not tested the matter it is surprising to see the\r\namount of honey which a swarm of bees will store when not allowed to\r\nswarm, and _fed judiciously_, ample box room being provided of _easy\r\naccess_, so that all the bees have room to work, and by this plan we\r\nare not constantly watching and waiting for swarms with uncertainty\r\nthroughout the entire summer, for we know with certainty when and where\r\nto look for swarms. In my plan, the swarming properties of bees are\r\neffectively controlled, without frequently disturbing or overhauling\r\nthem, but by observing rules strictly in accordance with the habits and\r\ninstincts of bees.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Here let me be clearly understood. I admit that bees will\r\nsometimes swarm, with abundant room for work in their boxes. Yet I\r\nclaim that on my plan all increase by swarming may be prevented without\r\ngreat trouble or perplexity, such as has heretofore attended all\r\nattempts to bring about this greatly to be desired object. If a person\r\ncommences bee keeping, with a certain number of swarms in controllable\r\nhives, and in early spring gives the bees access to the hive boxes,\r\nand later, after they commence work in them, gives the bees access to\r\nthe top boxes, giving them otherwise ordinary care, (except to feed if\r\ndesired,) but a small proportion will swarm on the average yearly. Much\r\nthe larger portion will work in the boxes without swarming out, and\r\ngive a handsome yield of surplus box honey, the yield of course being\r\ngoverned by the amount of feed given them, and the yield from flowers,\r\netc. But if increase of stocks is preferred, rather than surplus box\r\nhoney--if the bees are not given access to the boxes, but confined in\r\ntheir labors to the brood section of the hive, being fed as directed,\r\nnearly every one will swarm, and swarm early.]\r\n\r\nIf you wish your bees in controllable hives to swarm keep the partition\r\nin place at the sides of the brood section, and the honey board over\r\nthe top; or in other words, keep the bees confined in their labors to\r\nthe central or brood section of the hive. Now, if you wish them to\r\nswarm in any particular week of the swarming season, ten days before,\r\nremove the old queen. (It is well to kill her, and to do so, take with\r\nher about a pint of bees, and put them in a small miniature hive, six\r\nor eight inches square, with movable frames, like those in the central\r\npart of the controllable hive. Keep them shut in, twenty-four hours;\r\nthen give them their liberty, and they will work the same as a large\r\nswarm through the summer; but will not winter. If such queens are known\r\nto be _very old_ it is best to destroy them when we take them from\r\nthe swarm. _Keep only young, vigorous queens._) The bees in the hive,\r\nfrom which you have taken the queen, will in nearly every instance,\r\nconstruct queen cells _immediately_ to replace the loss of their queen.\r\nAt the earliest possible moment, they seem to sense fully their loss,\r\nand to know that if they do not get another queen at once, their loss\r\nis irreparable. They usually will construct a number of cells, perhaps\r\na half dozen or more. These will hatch in about ten days, and then\r\nswarms will issue.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Should any stock fail to swarm within two weeks from the\r\ntime the queen is removed, at the end of that time, examine such stock,\r\nand if they have no queen they must be furnished with one. About one\r\nstock in twenty, deprived of its queen as directed, will fail to rear\r\nqueens.]\r\n\r\nIf you wish to devote but little time to your bees, and are not\r\nparticular as to the time of swarming, and wish to have but _very few\r\nswarms, or perhaps none at all_, early in the spring, as soon as bees\r\ncommence their work, put on the boxes (sides and top,) and give the\r\nbees access to them; side boxes first, top boxes later. By this course,\r\nbut a very small proportion of your stocks will swarm, (if this plan is\r\nto be practiced each year, it will be necessary to replace the _old_\r\nqueens with _young_ ones every three or four years. If this is not\r\ndone, queens will die, or become barren from old age, and consequently\r\nloss of stocks follows. Keep this point in your mind: _young healthy,\r\nprolific queens, are essential to success_,) as they will have ample\r\nroom in the boxes for their labor. Occasionally a hive treated in\r\nthis way will swarm, and, if you wish to have no increase of stocks\r\nwhatever, if a swarm comes out, hive it in a light box, and _as soon as\r\nthis is done_, go to the hive which they came from and smoke lightly;\r\nif the bees are cross, lift out the comb frames from the brood section\r\nwith the bees adhering; examine each and every comb _carefully_ for\r\nqueen cells, _and cut off all but one_. Success here depends on _care\r\nand thoroughness_, for if you leave more than one cell, your bees may\r\nswarm out again in a day or two.\r\n\r\nAfter this is done, spread a sheet on the ground; set a light box,\r\nlike the one in which you have the bees, near one side; raise the edge\r\ntowards where you will shake the bees one inch or a little more, to\r\ngive the bees a chance to enter the box. Shake the bees from the hive,\r\nby a quick, jerking motion, upon the sheet, the most of them some two\r\nor three feet from the box. With a large spoon or ladle, put a few up\r\nnear the box, so they will enter, and disturb the others gently with a\r\nquill or light brush. When they commence to enter the box, they will\r\nset up a loud and continual humming, or call, and the bees on the\r\nsheet, if lightly disturbed with the quill or brush, will spread out,\r\nand march towards the hive, while those on the wing will alight, and\r\njoin them in the march. Now look _closely_ for the queen, and capture\r\nher. If she is not found before the bees get into the box, shake them\r\nout again, and go through the same process, till you find her. As soon\r\nas you have secured the queen, the bees, in a few minutes, finding\r\nthemselves destitute of a queen, and not having the means of raising\r\nanother to take her place, will rise on the wing, and return to the\r\nold stock from which they came, and will not come out again, but will\r\nwork in the boxes throughout the season. I will treat of this subject\r\nof swarming no further in this chapter. The merits of the Controllable\r\nHive and New System of Bee Management, will be fully shown further on\r\nin this work, and the most explicit instructions given for rearing bees\r\nwith profit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n                     PATENT AND NON-PATENT HIVES,\r\n                          BEE JOURNALS, ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\nI HAVE learned from bitter experience, as has nearly every one, who has\r\nkept bees for any length of time, the dishonesty, and utter disregard\r\nfor truth, of a class of speculators who prey upon the unsuspecting\r\nbee-keeper. Patent hives--the great majority of them--are a curse and\r\na hindrance to successful and profitable bee keeping. I have no time\r\nto describe the multitude of worthless patent hives, and the many\r\ntricks and swindles of the venders of the same, but I advise every bee\r\nkeeper to consult his own interests, and have nothing to do with them.\r\nNinety-nine out of every hundred are a swindle. I have tested their\r\nmerits and know whereof I affirm.\r\n\r\nThe More-patent hives against which I wish to caution the bee-keeper,\r\nand particularly the beginner, are those offered by A. J. Root,\r\npublisher of \"Gleanings in Bee Culture.\" Root makes the \"Gleanings\" the\r\nmedium for advertising and palming off upon the public his wares. Don't\r\ninvest in his trash if you wish to keep bees with profit. I am sorry\r\nto find that many of the bee journals and bee-keepers' associations,\r\nare conducted on prejudiced and selfish motives, and in the interest\r\nof some individual, or company of men, for the sole purpose of making\r\nmoney from the sale of some particular hive or fixture, without regard\r\nto merit, or value to the practical bee-keeper. All honest discussion,\r\nwith a view to bring out facts and figures to guide the inexperienced\r\nbee-keeper in his labors, I am sorry to say, is suppressed. The\r\nbee journals should be the disseminators of _useful_ knowledge\r\namong bee-keepers. I am sorry to find the reverse true with many of\r\nthem. After a thorough investigation, I feel it my duty to advise\r\nbee-keepers, and those contemplating bee-keeping, _not to take all for\r\ngranted that they read in the bee journals_, for if you do, you will be\r\nvery likely to soon find yourself robbed of your money, and your bees\r\nruined.\r\n\r\nVery many who write for the bee journals with high sounding words,\r\nclaiming to be adepts in bee culture, have really no _practical_\r\nknowledge of the nature and habits of bees. We have supported a host\r\nof speculators in our business, for a long time; the object of this\r\nclass has ever been, how best to secure our hard earnings, and with\r\nno desire or effort to aid in rendering bee keeping more profitable\r\nand desirable. The country is full of this class, and they always\r\ncombine to crush out real merit in anything pertaining to bee culture,\r\nbrought before the public by individual bee-keepers, who are laboring\r\nto advance the cause by giving their experiences, gained from hard\r\nevery-day labor among bees.\r\n\r\nFor many years I have written articles on bee culture, for the leading\r\nagricultural journals and newspaper. I have thus given much of my\r\nexperience in detail, with no thought of further reward than the\r\nsatisfaction of having contributed to aid bee-keepers in raising bees\r\nwith greater profit, believing if all would so contribute of their\r\npractical experience with bees, great mutual benefit might be gained,\r\nand rapid progress made in successful and profitable bee culture. In\r\nconsequence of my course in spreading information with a view to aid\r\nthe cause, the class referred to in this chapter, and their tools, are\r\nboiling over with wrath towards me, lying and slandering me through\r\nthe public press, and by every other means which their depraved natures\r\ncan invent. All because I have succeeded by hard study in perfecting\r\na hive and new system of bee management, which is fast coming into\r\ngeneral use among bee keepers; consequently the sale of their worthless\r\ntrash is decreasing rapidly. But I am anxious to get through with\r\nthis part of my work, and reach the practical part, where I have the\r\ngreatest confidence in my ability to give such information as will\r\nrender bee keeping profitable and desirable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n                               FEEDING.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEEDING bees, when judiciously managed, is the stepping stone to large\r\nprofits from them.\r\n\r\nBee-keepers who have heretofore attempted to feed bees have met with\r\npoor success.\r\n\r\nA bee-keeper of my acquaintance paid fifty dollars for a patent\r\napparatus for feeding bees together in the open air. The result was,\r\nsoon after being fed, they commenced fighting among themselves. The\r\nweaker stocks first fell prey to the stronger, then the stronger in\r\nturn were attacked, and the final result was, nearly every stock was\r\nruined, and the plan abandoned in disgust after the first season's\r\ntrial.\r\n\r\nNow it is plain to every intelligent person, that in order to receive\r\nthe greatest possible profit from bees, they must be fed. There can be\r\nno question as to the great benefit to be derived from feeding bees.\r\nThe only question is, how, when and what to feed. It is as much a\r\nnecessity to feed bees, as to feed our domestic animals, cows, sheep,\r\n&c., or to apply manure to plants, or any crop the farmer cultivates,\r\nto stimulate growth and increase the product, and consequent profit\r\nof the same. We should look upon that farmer as either a fool or a\r\nlunatic, who should furnish his domestic animals no food, except what\r\nthey obtained by grazing in the pastures and fields, the year round.\r\nAnd do you think his cows treated thus, would yield him a large\r\nproduct of butter, cheese and milk, and consequently a good profit in\r\ndollars and cents? Do you think he would find his cows, managed thus,\r\nso profitable as to induce him to keep cows to any great extent? Let\r\na farmer manage thus--take his cows to the barn, milk them, then turn\r\nthem out the year round to graze and provide for themselves, taking\r\nthem up only to milk them, furnishing them with no food except what\r\nthey procure by grazing--how long, think you, would such a farmer have\r\ncows to milk? Yet this is a parallel case with the bee-keeper who\r\nfurnishes his bees with no feed except what they can procure by their\r\nown industry. And is it surprising that bees treated thus pay no profit?\r\n\r\nAgain, the farmer who should year after year plant his corn, potatoes,\r\netc., apply no manure, furnish no cultivation, yet expect to succeed in\r\nfarming, harvest large crops, and get a good yearly profit in dollars\r\nand cents, and grumble because he did not, and at last abandon the\r\nbusiness, asserting that there was no profit in farming, furnishes\r\nanother parallel case to the bee-keeper who lets his bees shift for\r\nthemselves, and then grumbles because they pay no profit, and at last\r\nabandons the business, asserting that there is no money in bee-keeping.\r\n\r\nIt being self evident that it is profitable to feed bees, it now\r\nremains to show how to do it with the greatest possible profit.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Receipt for Feed.\r\n\r\nTo eight pounds of coffee crushed sugar, add two quarts of soft water,\r\nand whites of two eggs; bring to the boiling point over a _slow_ fire,\r\nbeing very careful not to burn it. Skim off carefully all skum or\r\nsediment that rises, so that the feed, when cool, will be perfectly\r\nclear and about the consistency of new honey.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FEEDER.]\r\n\r\nTo construct the feeder,[3] get a tin-worker to make you a tin dish,\r\nwith perpendicular sides, nine inches square inside, three inches deep,\r\n_without a bottom_. Around the lower edge turn the tin out about one\r\nhalf inch all round, for the dish to rest on when placed on the hive\r\nfor feeding the bees. Around the top of this dish put a stout wire\r\nto keep it in shape Get another tin dish made 8 by 8½ inches square\r\ninside, two and one-half inches deep, with a bottom. Place the smaller\r\ndish inside the larger one, the bottom of the inner dish _even and\r\nlevel with the lower edge of the outer dish_, which brings the top of\r\nthe under dish one-half inch lower than the upper edge of the outer\r\ndish; then when the outer dish is covered, (as it will be in feeding,)\r\nthere will be a halt inch space between the cover over the outer dish,\r\nand the top of the inner dish.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: With the aid of the engraving, there can be no mistake in\r\nconstructing the feeder, particularly as its position on the hive is\r\nshown under head of Construction of Controllable Hive, Chapter XVIII.]\r\n\r\nPlace one of the shorter sides of the inner dish against the inside\r\nof the outer dish, in such a position that there will be a half inch\r\nspace all round between the outer and inner dish, except at the side\r\nwhere you fasten them together; across this one side join them firmly\r\ntogether with solder; at the bottom near the opposite end solder brass\r\nor tin about one inch wide, across the half-inch space from the bottom\r\nof the inner dish to the edge of the outer dish, to hold the dishes\r\nfirmly in place. Near the upper edge of the outer dish solder an some\r\nstrips of lead about one inch long, by one-half inch wide, to turn\r\ndown over the corner when put on, to hold it in place. Now get out two\r\npieces of half-inch board, eight inches long, and two and one-half\r\ninches wide; with a thick saw, cut channels crosswise of the pieces,\r\nthree-eighths of an inch apart and one-fourth inch deep, the whole\r\nlength of the pieces, being careful to run your saw _square across the\r\npiece every time_. Next get out pieces to correspond with the number of\r\nchannels, eight inches long, two and one-half inches wide, one-eighth\r\ninch thick, (sawed out so the sides will be rough, to enable the bees\r\nthe better to hold fast to them, when taking feed). These pieces are to\r\nstand edgewise in the inner dish. With a sharp knife bring the ends of\r\nthe pieces to a thin edge, so they will easily slip into the channels\r\nin the half inch pieces. Put the pieces with the channels, one across\r\neach end of the inner dish, the channels of each facing the inside of\r\nthe dish, then slip the ends of your pieces that are one-eighth thick\r\ndown through the channels, to the bottom of the inner dish. Before you\r\nput them down into the dish, cut out a small notch, in what will be\r\nthe lower end of each piece after it is put down into the dish, so the\r\nfood when poured in will flow to all parts of the feeder. The pieces or\r\nslats when all put edgewise in the dish will reach to the bottom and be\r\non a level with the edges of the _inner dish_.\r\n\r\nNow for the cover: get out a piece of board a half-inch thick, nine and\r\none-fourth inches long, four inches wide. In the centre of this piece,\r\nwith a sharp bit, make a one-inch hole; cover the hole with fine wire\r\ncloth, bent a little convex. Put this piece of board over the outer\r\ndish, with wire cloth next to the inside of the dish, (put it across\r\nthat end where the dishes are soldered together,) hold it in place by\r\nturning up over it the pieces of lead soldered on near the upper edge\r\nof the outer dish. Cover the bottom of the dish with glass, held in\r\nplace in the same manner, by the leads.\r\n\r\nYour Feeder is now finished. Set it over the brood section on the top,\r\nat the rear, the wood cover next to the back of the hive, the glass\r\ntoward the front. Cover that portion of the brood section of the hive,\r\nnot covered with the feeder, with a honey board, so no bees can get up\r\ninto the cap of the hive.\r\n\r\nNow to feed, pour the feed in at the inch hole, in the cover. The\r\nbees pass from the hive up between the sides of the outer and inner\r\ndishes, in the half-inch space, over the sides of the inner dish, in\r\nthe half-inch space between the cover of the outer dish and the edges\r\nof the slats that are placed edgewise in the inner dish, and pass down\r\n_between the slats_, after feed in the inner dish. The hole in the\r\ncover should be kept closed with a cork, to confine the heat to the\r\nhive, exclude insects, etc.\r\n\r\nWhen first commencing to feed a stock, scatter some of the feed over\r\nthe tops of the frames in the brood section; also on the sides of the\r\ndishes on each side of the half-inch space leading lo the feed, and on\r\ntop of the slats of the feeder, so the bees may find the way to the\r\nfeed. After they once learn the road, they will need no coaxing to\r\ninduce them to take the feed given them. The first warm days in early\r\nspring, as soon as the bees can fly a few hours in the middle of the\r\nday, mix corn meal with rye meal, equal parts, and set out, in pans or\r\nother shoal dishes, near the hives. The bees will carry this to their\r\nhives in considerable quantities. It it used as a substitute for pollen\r\nor bee bread, and is very essential in forwarding the increase of bees\r\nin early spring. The meal should be fed _very early_ in spring, for as\r\nsoon as the bees can collect pollen from the natural sources--trees,\r\nshrubs, flowers, etc., they will not take this meal.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Feeding for Early Swarms.\r\n\r\nIf you wish early swarms, keep the bees confined in their labors to\r\nthe brood section of the hive, or in other words, do not give them\r\naccess to the boxes, and commence as early in the spring as the bees\r\nbegin to fly in the middle of the day, and feed each stock at evening\r\nabout one-half pound of the liquid feed. Continue this till your swarms\r\nissue, then discontinue feeding.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Feeding for Surplus Honey.\r\n\r\nIf you wish surplus honey instead of swarms, put on your side boxes as\r\nearly in the spring as the bees commence brisk work on flowers,--as\r\na general rule, say a few days before fruit blossoms appear. Feed as\r\ndirected for swarms until about ten days before white clover blossoms,\r\nthen put on the top boxes, leaving room only for feeder. Then for ten\r\nor twelve days feed them all they will take. Feed at evening. They\r\nwill at first, perhaps, take from five to ten pounds every night.\r\n_Crowd them hard_, for the object is now to get every part of the brood\r\nsection (not occupied by eggs and brood) filled with honey; and if\r\npossible, crowd the bees into the boxes to commence the work of comb\r\nbuilding, so that during the yield of honey from flowers, you can get\r\nevery ounce collected, stored in the boxes.\r\n\r\nBy _early and judicious feeding_, we have encouraged breeding so that\r\nnow our hives are filled, almost to overflowing, with bees, ready to\r\ngather the harvest from the flowers as soon as they commence to yield\r\nhoney.\r\n\r\nDiscontinue feeding, while the yield of honey continues in full supply\r\nfrom the flowers. At the close of the yield, if you have boxes half\r\nfilled or more, feed all they will take up for a few days, or until\r\nyour boxes are finished.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Feeding for Winter.\r\n\r\nThe last of September or first of October feed such stocks as are short\r\nof stores, to winter them. Each stock should have twenty pounds of\r\nhoney in the brood section to winter safely. If they have less than\r\nthat, feed until they have that quantity, or take a frame of honey\r\nfrom a stock that has some to spare, and exchange with the one that is\r\nshort, and so proceed until all have sufficient stores to winter safely.\r\n\r\nIn no case take out frames at the close of the season, and leave that\r\nspace without a frame, or with an _empty_ frame. At the commencement\r\nof winter every hive must (to winter safely) have its full number\r\nof frames _filled_ with comb, no matter if they are not filled with\r\n_honey_ (if the hive has the required number of pounds,) but each frame\r\nmust be filled, or _nearly_ filled with comb, or there is great danger\r\nof loss from sudden changes of temperature through the winter.\r\n\r\nIn feeding for box honey, it often requires more than one pound of feed\r\nto secure a pound in boxes, for the bees consume some while storing\r\nit, and they often find some place in the hive which, like the crowded\r\nomnibus or street car, is not so full but that additions may be made.\r\n\r\nThe reader will bear in mind this simple fact: _Bees do not make honey,\r\nthey simply collect it._ Honey undergoes no chemical change in the\r\nstomach of the bee.\r\n\r\nSeveral years since my bees had access to several molasses hogsheads,\r\nand the result was, I found _pure molasses_ stored in my hives, in the\r\nsame comb with nice white honey. I am satisfied that the bee does not\r\n_make honey_, but _collects it_. My feed is prepared and recommended in\r\nview of this fact, and in perfect accord with all points bearing upon\r\nthis subject.\r\n\r\nThe feed is of the same color as the nicest, white clover honey, and\r\nwhen put in boxes by the bees with the honey collected from flowers, (I\r\nhave no doubt in many instances in alternate layers in the same cell\r\nwith honey from flowers,) it cannot be distinguished, either in color\r\nor taste, from honey collected _wholly_ from flowers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n                       BOXES FOR SURPLUS HONEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN the last chapter directions were given, when to put on boxes, but\r\nit is important to know more about this matter, the kind of boxes to\r\nuse, how made, etc. I shall recommend a glass-box; that is, glass sides\r\nwith wood corner-posts, top, and bottom,[4] such as I use with the\r\nControllable Hive. The size and description of box is as follows, viz:\r\nget out a piece of board six and three-sixteenths inches long, by four\r\nand three-sixteenths inches wide; three-sixteenths inch thick for the\r\ntop of box; another, same size, for bottom. For the top boxes, that is,\r\nthe boxes that are to be placed over the brood section, with a sharp\r\nbit make four one-inch holes in one of the pieces, for the passage of\r\nthe bees from the hive to the top boxes; next get out four pieces,\r\nfive inches long, five-eighths square, for corner-posts to the boxes.\r\nRebate two sides of each post about one-fourth inch square, to receive\r\nthe glass sides and ends, which are held in place by small tin points.\r\nGet glass for the boxes 5 × 5½ inches square for the sides, and 3½ × 5\r\ninches square for the ends. Nail the bottom and top to the ends of the\r\nposts, having the corner of the post come out even with the corners of\r\ntop and bottom. A small (half-inch) finishing brad will hold the posts\r\nin place. While nailing, hold the box perfectly square.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: These boxes are shown in engravings under head of\r\nConstruction of Controllable Hive, Chapter XVIII, which, with the\r\ndescription here given, cannot fail to be understood.]\r\n\r\nFor the side boxes, omit the holes in bottom, and leave out the glass\r\nfrom one end, and in place of the glass put in a piece of wood five\r\ninches long, two inches wide, three-eighths inch thick; place this\r\npiece in the center at the end, leaving an open space next to each\r\ncorner post at that end for the passage of the bees from the hive to\r\nthe boxes.\r\n\r\nThese boxes are just wide enough for two combs running the longest\r\nway of the box. Before putting in the glass, if you have any pieces\r\nof white, clean comb, it will be a great advantage to stick two small\r\npieces of this comb in each box, where you wish the comb built. Place\r\nthe pieces in the top of the box two inches apart. Melt the edge of the\r\ncomb and apply in place where you want it, while hot; hold it in place\r\ntill it cools, and it will remain.\r\n\r\nThe bees will commence work much sooner in boxes with the comb than\r\nthey would without, even if the pieces of comb are not more than an\r\ninch square.\r\n\r\nThese boxes, when well filled with honey, will each weigh about four\r\nand one-half pounds. Honey in the boxes is very attractive, and is\r\nsought for in the market by customers who have purchased in this form.\r\nHoney put up in these nice glass boxes shows its superior quality at a\r\nglance, and customers prefer to purchase in such boxes, with no tare\r\ndeducted for weight of box, to purchasing in the ordinary wood box with\r\nthe weight of the box deducted.\r\n\r\nIn taking these boxes from the hive, when filled with honey, in warm\r\nweather, I recommend the following method: Take the boxes off early\r\nin the morning, and carry them to some out-building, and put them in\r\na clean, tight box or barrel; place the boxes in such a manner that\r\nthe openings in the boxes will be free for the passage of the bees\r\nfrom them. Spread over the box or barrel, a thin piece of cloth. The\r\nbees will leave the boxes, and collect on the under side of the cloth,\r\nwhich must be turned every few minutes, until all are out, except a few\r\ndrones and very young Lees; these can be taken out with a pencil. To\r\nfacilitate the removal of the bees from the boxes, if any are obstinate\r\nabout leaving, remove the glass in the sides of the boxes, _if the\r\ncover is not fastened to it_. The greater part of the bees from these\r\nboxes will return to their hives; excepting a very few young ones which\r\nhad never before been away from the hive; these will be lost. Thirty\r\nboxes like the ones here recommended fit each controllable hive--ten on\r\neach side, and ten on top over the brood section.[5]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: When the box frames or partitions are taken out in the\r\nhoney season, the bees will often, if the stock is strong, spread out\r\nover the bottom, so that in putting the frame in, a large number will\r\nget crushed. To prevent this, get out two pieces of wood, each about\r\none and one-half inches wide, and one-fourth inch thick, one eighteen\r\ninches long, the other twenty-two inches long; one edge of the long\r\npiece bevel to a thin edge, about the shape of a carpenter's chisel.\r\nNail the long piece in the center to the end of the short piece at\r\nright angles with it, with the beveled edge down, so the beveled edge\r\nwill be level with the end of the short piece; also bevel the lower end\r\nof the short piece. When the bees are spread over the bottom of the\r\nbox section, with this instrument push them gently back to the brood\r\nsection. To do this, thrust the instrument down into the box section\r\nwith the beveled edge down; taking hold of the end of the short piece,\r\nor handle, work the bees gently back to the brood section, and when\r\nclose up to the combs of the hive, let it remain to keep the bees from\r\nspreading over the bottom till you get the box frame down in its place,\r\nthen remove it, and push the box frame up close to the brood section,\r\nso the ends of the boxes will be as near the brood combs, as the inside\r\nboard of the partition was when the combs were built. If this is not\r\ndone, and a large space is left, the bees will either lengthen the\r\ncells in the outer comb of the brood section, or build a new comb,\r\nbetween the ends of the boxes, and the outer comb of the brood section.\r\nIn either case, we would find it very troublesome when we remove the\r\nboxes, and wish to put in the partition for wintering. Be sure to put\r\nthe large box frame up close to the combs of the brood section, that\r\nis, leave barely space enough for the bees to pass between the ends of\r\nthe boxes, and the outer comb of the brood section.]\r\n\r\nWhen boxes are to be taken off, use tobacco smoke freely, to quiet the\r\nanger of the bees. Puff smoke in at the entrance of the hive, before\r\nyou touch it, then start the _top_ boxes from their fastening, giving\r\nthe bees a puff or two of smoke at every crevice about the boxes at the\r\ntop and sides.\r\n\r\n\r\n                Cake of Honey in Boxes in Warm Weather.\r\n\r\nConsiderable care is necessary for the preservation of honey in boxes\r\nremoved from the hives in warm weather. As soon as the bees are all out\r\nof the boxes, seal up all openings to the boxes, and set them away (in\r\nthe same position they occupied in the hive, so the honey will not leak\r\nfrom the cells) in a _dry, dark, cool room_. We must now guard against\r\nthe moth.\r\n\r\nAs in warm weather the instincts of the fly is directed to the dead\r\ncarcase, so is the moth directed to honey-comb left without bees in\r\nthe summer season, and by a similar process is each destroyed. When\r\nthe bees have been off about ten days, or perhaps a little less if the\r\nweather is very warm, examine closely for the first appearance of the\r\nmoth worms on the surface of the combs in the boxes. Their presence may\r\nbe known by small, thread-like webs or cocoons on the surface of the\r\ncomb, growing larger as the moth worm enlarges in growth. If no remedy\r\nis applied, these worms will completely destroy the beauty of the honey\r\nin the boxes in a very few days. Watch the boxes closely, and on the\r\n_first_ appearance of the least sign of worms in the boxes, fumigate\r\nwith burning sulphur, thus: open the passages in the boxes; have ready\r\na tight, clean box; saturate some _very dry_ pine shavings with melted\r\nsulphur. After placing your boxes of honey in the box, set a saucer or\r\nplate in the box at the bottom, away from the honey boxes, so they will\r\nnot take fire. Do not use too many shavings; if you do, it will injure\r\nthe honey comb in the boxes, by giving it a green color, and imparting\r\nto it a disagreeable taste; a half-dozen shavings each four inches long\r\nis enough. Place them in the dish and ignite them, and cover closely,\r\nso no fumes can escape; let them remain for a _few minutes_, (not more\r\nthan five, less is often sufficient; it depends something on the amount\r\nof sulphur adhering to the shavings, as well as the size of box, number\r\nof boxes to be fumigated, etc.) With a little practice you will manage\r\ncorrectly and successfully. As soon as the boxes are fumigated, seal up\r\n_every opening carefully_, and set away as before directed, in a _dry,\r\ndark, cool room_. Watch the boxes for a few days, to be sure the worms\r\nare all killed. If you find they are not, give them another dose of the\r\nsulphur. After the worms are all killed, and every opening to the box\r\nsealed up, wrap each box separately in paper, and they will be safe\r\nthrough the summer.\r\n\r\nHow the eggs of the moth get into the boxes, has always puzzled\r\nbee-keepers. It is hardly possible for the moth miller to pass through\r\na hive crowded with bees, to deposit her eggs in the crowded boxes. How\r\nthey get there must be guess-work--that they are there, is well known\r\nto many bee keepers. I feel very confident that the eggs are deposited\r\nthere after the boxes are taken from the hive, and while we are getting\r\nthe bees out of the boxes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n                         SWARMING AND HIVING.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNDER the old systems of bee keeping, swarming was very imperfectly\r\nunderstood. And even at the present time it is amusing to see how many\r\nold bee-keepers manage their bees. This is a class of old fogies, who\r\ndenounce all improvements and progress in bee keeping, and who, year\r\nafter year, move in the same tracks in the management of their bees,\r\nasserting that they know all about bees that is worth knowing. It is,\r\nto say the least, amusing, to see how this class of bee-keepers manage\r\nwhen their bees swarm.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of some very warm day in June or July, the alarm \"_bees\r\nswarming_,\" is sounded. Immediately the whole household is turned\r\nout, some beating tin pans, some sounding horns, some shaking cow\r\nbells--anything and everything with which to make a terrible din is\r\ncaught up in the excitement, and every member of the household works\r\nwith the sole aim of making as much noise as possible. This is done to\r\n_make the bees cluster!_ _If this is not done, they will leave for the\r\nwoods!_ I should think the poor bees would leave any way, to get rid of\r\nthe noise and the foolish whims of their owner. But no, they dislike\r\nto leave the place of their nativity, so in ten minutes or less from\r\nthe time they leave the hive, they settle in a cluster on some object,\r\ngenerally within a half-dozen rods of the hive. And they would have\r\ndone so in this case if no noise had been made. _The noise did not\r\naffect them in the least._\r\n\r\nNow the bees are to be hived, and we will see how it is done in the old\r\nway.\r\n\r\nThe bees in this case have clustered on a limb of a valuable pear tree.\r\n\"Very sorry they have pitched there,\" says the man of perfect knowledge\r\nin bee keeping; \"I dislike to injure that tree, but there is no help\r\nfor it.\"\r\n\r\nBut first a hive must be prepared. It is not quite ready. (This is bad\r\nmanagement.) It must be washed out thoroughly on the inside with salt\r\nand water, and rubbed over with some sweet scented herbs. A bottom\r\nboard must be got ready etc., etc. At last the hive is ready. Now this\r\nwise bee keeper places a table near where the swarm clustered, sets\r\nhis hive on the table, raises one edge four or six inches, takes his\r\nsaw--Oh, it is a pity to cut that nice limb full of fruit from the\r\npear tree; but it must be done, thinks this man of perfection in bee\r\nmanagement.\r\n\r\nHe grasps the limb firmly near the cluster of bees. They are _very\r\ncross, and uneasy_. They have been clustered an hour or more, while he\r\nhas been getting his hive ready. He saws off the limbs on which the\r\nbees are hanging, and places it carefully, with the bees adhering, on\r\nthe table, by the side of the hive, covers all _very nicely_ with a\r\nclean sheet, and leaves them alone to enter the hive. At _about sunset_\r\nhe will place the hive with the bees in it on the stand it is to occupy.\r\n\r\nAt the time designated (about sunset) he goes out to his hive on the\r\ntable. It has been a very hot afternoon, and the hive was where it\r\nreceived the full force of the sun's rays. He carefully raises the\r\nsheet. There is the limb on which the bees clustered, but where are\r\nthe bees, they are not on the limb? Why, in the hive, of course. That\r\nis where he expected to find them. He peeps carefully under the hive\r\nto see how they are getting along, but astonishment is depicted on his\r\ncountenance when he discovers that his hive is empty. His bees have\r\nleft for other parts beyond his knowledge. He tries to think of some\r\nreason why the bees have gone, and seeks to lay the blame upon the\r\nhive. \"Oh!\" he says \"I guess they did not like the hive, but I guess I\r\nshall have better luck next time.\"\r\n\r\nTo a progressive bee keeper, one who has correct and practical\r\nknowledge of the natural habits of bees, it is very plain why they\r\nleft. They were actually driven away by mismanagement. The heat of the\r\nsun pouring down upon them, was enough of itself to drive them off.\r\nThen placing the limb, with the cluster adhering to it, on the table\r\nnear the hive, showed lack of knowledge of the natural habits of bees.\r\nThe hive might as well have been in the house, as placed where it was.\r\nThen the hour or more taken to get the hive ready, gave the bees time\r\nto send out their scouts, to look up a location of their own, and when\r\nthese scouts returned, they left with them for a new home. T contend\r\nevery swarm does this, viz: They swarm out of the old parent stock,\r\nled by the old queen. They cluster on some object, as a tree, brush\r\nor vine, near the old home. Then they immediately send out a few bees\r\nor scouts to look up a new home. These scouts may be gone a longer or\r\nshorter time. When they return, if they find the bees clustered where\r\nthey were when they left, they soon lead them off to the new quarters,\r\nbut if before the scouts are sent out, or before they return, the\r\nswarm is hived and placed on the stand it is to occupy, then the swarm\r\nwill not leave, for the scouts know not where to find them, or if they\r\nshould find them, the bees would seldom leave a good clean hive, for\r\na home in the woods. These scouts may often be seen playing about the\r\nplace where a swarm has clustered, for several days after the swarm has\r\nbeen hived.\r\n\r\nHad this bee keeper placed his hire on the table, _as soon as the bees\r\nwere clustered_, and raised the front edge one inch, instead of four\r\nor six inches, and then, instead of cutting off the limbs, if he had\r\ntaken a basket or pan, placed it beneath the cluster of bees, and by a\r\nsudden jar of the limb dislodged them from it into the basket or pan,\r\nthen emptied them down in front of the hive, and sprinkled lightly with\r\na little water, at the same time disturbing them gently with a quill or\r\nlight brush so they would not collect around and block up the entrance,\r\nexcept a very few that may be flying in the air (and these will return\r\nto the old hive,) in this way getting them all into the hive, and\r\nimmediately carrying it to the stand it was to occupy, covering it with\r\na board to shade it from the hot rays of the sun, or placing it in the\r\nshade of a tree, he would have saved his bees, the damage to his pear\r\ntree, and much perplexity.\r\n\r\nBy the old methods of managing bees, there were no means of knowing\r\nwhen to expect swarms; consequently the bees were sometimes watched\r\nall summer, in expectation of swarms any pleasant day, as outside\r\nindications were fa vol able for them; yet they would often adhere to\r\nthe old hive throughout the entire summer.\r\n\r\nWith the controllable hive and new system of bee management, as shown\r\nin this work, swarming is brought completely under the control of the\r\nbee keeper. It is well for him to understand _correctly_ what are the\r\nrequisites and preparations for natural swarming by the bees, when left\r\nto themselves in a natural state. They are as follows: The bees must\r\nbe obtaining honey freely, either from flowers, or from feed supplied\r\nthem. The combs must be filled with brood in all stages of growth, from\r\nthe egg just deposited in the cell, to the perfect bee just emerging.\r\n(And from this, bee keepers will note what conditions are required\r\nat the time swarms are forced, as recommended in my plan.) When this\r\ncondition of affairs is reached, the bees construct queen cells, (that\r\nis, if they deride to swarm; they will do as they like about it, if\r\nleft entirely to themselves,) from which in about sixteen days the\r\nqueens will hatch, unless the bees should change their intentions, and\r\ndecide not to swarm, and destroy all the queen cells. Remember, they\r\nare having it all their own way. When these cells are sealed over and\r\nfinished is the time (if everything is favorable), when the first swarm\r\nleaves, led off by the old queen. Some of the most reliable works on\r\nbees have taught that the queen cells _must be half finished before the\r\nqueen will deposit the egg that is to produce the queen;_ but this, I\r\nfind by close observation, is a mistake; for if you take the queen away\r\nfrom a stock, _with no queen cells in any stage of formation in the\r\nhive_, the bees will rear a queen _from a worker egg, deposited in an\r\nordinary worker cell_. And who shall say they do not do this when the\r\nqueen is present? I am satisfied they do.\r\n\r\nThus we see in _natural_ swarming, _with the bees left to themselves_,\r\nthe old queen leaves with the first swarm, at about the time the queen\r\ncells are sealed over and finished, which is about eight days before\r\nthe young queens hatch.\r\n\r\nWhen the young queens hatch, after-swarms (as second and third issues,\r\nor all after the first,) will issue. Second swarms may be expected in\r\nabout eight days after the first. This time will sometimes vary, as\r\nthe hatching of the queen somewhat depends on the weather, the number\r\nof bees left in the old stock, etc.; a low temperature retards the\r\nhatching, while a high temperature forwards it.\r\n\r\nAt evening of about the eighth or tenth day after the first swarm, by\r\nputting your ear close to the hive you will hear, very plainly, every\r\nfew minutes, several clear and distinct \"peeping\" sounds, very sharp at\r\ntimes, then hoarse and dull. This sound proceeds from the young queen\r\njust hatched. When it is heard, look out for a swarm the next day;\r\nthough it sometimes happens that one or two days will intervene before\r\nthey will issue. But as long as the sound continues, be on the lookout\r\nfor swarms. This \"peeping\" can always be heard before a second swarm\r\nissues, if we will take the trouble to listen. The time between second\r\nand third swarms is invariably from one to four days. It is useless to\r\nlook for after-swarms from a stock _after twenty_ days from the first.\r\nThey are generally all out within sixteen days from the issue of the\r\nfirst swarm. I have given in another place, under the head of \"Swarming\r\nControlled,\" instructions how to manage swarming under my new system.\r\nSome additional information I will give in this connection.\r\n\r\nJust before swarms are expected, if there are no trees near your hives,\r\nor if there are large trees from which it would be difficult to take\r\na swarm of bees were they to cluster on the branches, procure several\r\nevergreen trees, such as spruce or fir, three or four feet high.\r\nLeave the limbs on, excepting about a foot at the bottom. Sharpen the\r\ntrunks, so they can be set in the ground and lifted out with ease. With\r\na bar make large holes, about a foot deep, in front of your hives,\r\nsome distant about six feet, others from twelve to thirty feet. Set a\r\nhalf-dozen or more of these trees in these holes, putting in by the\r\nside of them a small stone or piece of wood, to hold firmly in place\r\nand prevent swaying by the wind. When your swarms issue, they will\r\nbe very likely to cluster on some of these trees, when they can be\r\nconveniently gathered in the Controllable Hive.\r\n\r\nIn hiving, if the bees have clustered on some one of the trees set\r\nfor them, place the Controllable Hive on the stand it is to occupy,\r\nallowing the stand to project two feet in front of the hive. Draw back\r\nthe bottom board under the brood section ten or fifteen inches, to give\r\nthe bees a good chance to enter the hive. _Shade the hive well._ Now\r\ngo to the tree on which your swarm is clustered. Remove the stone or\r\npiece of wood that holds it in place; lift the tree, carefully avoiding\r\nany jar, carry it to the hive, and hold the cluster down to the stand\r\nand close up to the hive, _as near the entrance as possible_. Then give\r\nthe tree a sudden jar, sufficient to dislodge the cluster of bees.\r\nThey will fall directly at the entrance of the hive, and immediately\r\ncommence to enter. Sprinkle _lightly_ with water, and _gently_ disturb\r\nthose that stop about the entrance, with a quill or brush, till all\r\nare made to enter the hive. Then slide the bottom board forward to its\r\nplace and the work is done.\r\n\r\nShould the bees cluster on some large tree or other out of the way\r\nplace, the manner of hiving must be varied. Set your hive near by with\r\na wide board in front to keep the bees out of the grass and dirt.\r\nArrange the hive as before directed. If the bees are clustered on a\r\nsmall limb, high above your reach, secure a basket to a pole, and raise\r\nit directly beneath the cluster. Dislodge the bees from their position,\r\nwhen they will fall directly into the basket, which you should take\r\ndown quickly and shake the bees from it down to the entrance to the\r\nhive, and proceed as before. Keep the limb on which they were clustered\r\nin motion for a few minutes, to prevent their return. Should they\r\ncluster on the body of a tree, or a large limb, where they cannot be\r\nshaken off, set your hive near by, as before directed, and with a\r\nhandled dipper dip them off and turn them down in front of the hive\r\nnear the entrance. Dip _very carefully_, so as not to crush any of the\r\nbees. They will not attempt to sting if you treat them well, and prove\r\nto them that you are their friend. After you have dipped off a portion\r\nof the bees, and got them moving into the hive, if the queen is with\r\nthem, they will all leave the cluster and join their companions who are\r\nentering their new home. But if the queen remains with the cluster, as\r\nsoon as those entering the hive discover that she is not with them,\r\nthey will leave the hive and rejoin the cluster. So it is well to\r\nkeep dipping as long as you can get any of the bees, or till you are\r\n_certain_ the bees are leaving the cluster and entering the hive of\r\ntheir own accord.\r\n\r\nIt sometimes happens in natural swarming, that when a swarm issues, led\r\nby the _old_ queen, which has occupied the hive for a year or more,\r\nthat she finds herself unable to fly, and drops down in front of the\r\nhive. In this case, if left to themselves, the bees, after flying about\r\nfor perhaps five or ten minutes, will return to the hive from whence\r\nthey came, and remain until the young queens hatch, issuing again,\r\nabout the time a second swarm would have come out, or perhaps a little\r\nearlier.\r\n\r\nIf you are on hand you can prevent the swarm returning, but you must\r\nbe lively. If you find the bees are flying longer than usual without\r\nclustering, and appear scattered and disorganized in their movements,\r\nlook in front of the hive from which they issued, for the queen. You\r\nwill probably find her within two or three feet of the hive. Put her\r\nin a tumbler, and cover closely, to prevent her escape. As soon as you\r\nfind the bees have commenced to return to the old hive, set it back out\r\nof the way, and throw a sheet or some other covering over it.[6] Then\r\nset your Controllable Hive in its place, with the bottom board drawn\r\nback as directed in hiving a new swarm. Set the tumbler containing the\r\nqueen over the brood section, so the confined queen can pass down into\r\nthe hive, but leaving no chance for her to escape by any other way. The\r\nbees will then enter the hive readily. And as soon as all are in, which\r\nwill be in a few minutes, remove the hive to a new stand and shade as\r\ndirected before. Set the old stock back in its former place.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: If other hives are near, on each side, it will be well to\r\nthrow the covering over them also, to prevent the swarm entering any\r\nother than the designed hive, as they might possibly do, if the hives\r\nwere only a few feet distant.]\r\n\r\nThe foregoing circumstance often happens when bees are managed on the\r\nold swarming plan, and queens that are unable to fly are usually very\r\nold. On my plan of management such cases are of rare occurrence.\r\n\r\nNatural swarms usually issue between nine o'clock in the forenoon, and\r\none o'clock in the afternoon. Occasionally one will issue earlier in\r\nthe forenoon or later in the afternoon; but as a general rule they make\r\ntheir appearance between the hours specified.\r\n\r\nVery early swarms hived in Controllable Hives should have access to\r\nthe boxes on one side only. In about ten days after being hived, and\r\nas soon as the bees are well at work in these, give them access to the\r\nother side. Swarms that are hived late in the season, will not require\r\nboxes, until the next season, as it is necessary to have the brood\r\nsection filled, or nearly filled, before the bees have access to the\r\nboxes.\r\n\r\nIt is important that we have the combs in the brood section built\r\n_straight in the frames_, so as to be easily lifted out _separately_.\r\nTo aid in securing this object, when a swarm is first hived in a\r\ncontrollable hive, raise the rear of the hive four inches, by putting\r\nunder it a piece of joist, having the hive perfectly level from side\r\nto side. This gives the frames a pitch forward, and will greatly aid\r\nin securing straight combs. Let the hive remain in this position for a\r\nweek or ten days, then set it down level. If you have it to spare, one\r\nframe filled with comb placed in the brood section near the center will\r\ninsure straight combs in the balance. If no precaution is taken in this\r\ndirection, the bees will _sometimes_ build the comb crosswise of the\r\nbrood section, notwithstanding the triangular comb guides in the frames\r\nof each controllable hive. As straight combs in the brood section are\r\nvery important, we should employ every available means to aid in\r\nsecuring them.\r\n\r\nIt is well to keep on hand a few plain boxes, each with four movable\r\nframes, like those in the controllable hive. If at any time a swarm\r\ncomes out at the _very last of the honey season_, hive them in one of\r\nthese boxes. They will probably enlarge or quite fill the four frames\r\nwith comb, and perhaps store a little honey. Then, in the fall, put\r\nthese four frames, with the bees and comb, in a controllable hive, and\r\nadd two frames, well filled with honey, from a stock that can spare it.\r\nIn this way you will build up a good stock for winter, whereas if you\r\nhad hived them in a full sized controllable hive so late in the season,\r\nthey would probably have put a little comb in each of the six frames,\r\nbut not enough to winter, rendering it necessary for you to feed with\r\nthe liquid feed in the fall. It is better to have four frames nearly or\r\nquite filled with comb, than to have six frames with a very little comb\r\nin each.\r\n\r\nIt sometimes happens that a swarm of bees, which has worked well in\r\nboxes through the entire honey season, will swarm out about the time\r\nthe yield of honey ceases. If managed on the old plan, such swarms are\r\n_worthless_, but by hiving them in a box with four movable frames, as\r\ndirected, they make valuable stocks. All such swarms may be returned to\r\nthe old stock, as directed in another chapter, yet we sometimes wish to\r\nincrease the number of our stocks to the utmost, and it is convenient\r\nto know how to make valuable stock of these late issues. Then they can\r\neither be returned or hived, whichever the bee keeper thinks is most\r\nfor his or her interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n                            ANGER OF BEES.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE anger of bees, when once thoroughly aroused, is much to be dreaded,\r\nas the results which follow are often of a very serious nature. In my\r\nown case, I can handle bees with perfect impunity. They rarely make\r\nany attempt to sting, no matter what liberties I take with them. I\r\nalways intend to be very careful, and handle them gently, making them\r\nunderstand that I do not mean to harm them. In my first efforts in\r\nhandling bees they were very apt to sting me, for the reason that I did\r\nnot understand their nature; consequently they mistook my intentions,\r\nand often forced me to seek shelter from their attacks. Now I seldom\r\nuse any protection when working among them. Often, in transferring the\r\nbees and comb from the old box hive to the Controllable Hive, I roll\r\nup my sleeves, and with no protection whatever, for the hands or face,\r\ncut out the comb from the old hive, with the bees adhering to it, and\r\narrange and fasten it in the new hive, without the bees making any\r\nattempt to sting me.\r\n\r\nI would not recommend any one to do this, until they are so well\r\nacquainted with, and accustomed to handling, the bees, as to understand\r\nperfectly their every characteristic, and be quite certain that they\r\nwill not make an attack. It is better to protect the hands and face\r\nfrom their attacks, as you will thus feel greater confidence in\r\nyourself, and can perform all operations without fear of stings. It\r\nis well to understand what will arouse the anger of bees, and cause\r\nthem to sting. If we breathe upon them, when they are in or about the\r\nhive or boxes, they deem it an insult, and will dash at and sting\r\nus at once. Any sudden jar of the hive is instantly resented. All\r\nquick, spiteful motions about the hive, such as running, jumping,\r\netc., is noticed, and quite sure to be followed by a sting. The finger\r\npointed at them with a quick, spiteful motion when they are standing\r\nas sentinels about the entrance of the hive, often provokes stings.\r\nIf they come buzzing around, threatening to sting, perhaps striking\r\nyour hat almost like a bullet, and should you return the compliment\r\nby striking at them with your hand, they will be quite sure to sting\r\nyou. The better way is, if unprotected, to hold down your head so as to\r\nprotect your face, and move away from the hive as quietly as possible.\r\nWhen the bees find you are retreating, they will not follow you far.\r\nAlways remember that if one bee stings you, others are very sure to\r\n_immediately_ follow, unless you retreat. I believe that bees have a\r\nlanguage by which they make known to each other their wants and wishes;\r\nand I feel certain they know those who have the care of them, and\r\nbecome accustomed to the motions and appearance of those who are seen\r\nby them daily.\r\n\r\nThe members of my family are seldom stung by the bees, notwithstanding\r\nI sometimes have fifty hives or more where we pass within twenty feet\r\nof them many times a day, while the bees are flying in thousands about\r\neach hive. In the middle of the day, in the honey season, the air for\r\nmany rods about the hives is full of bees. I find my bees are much more\r\nlikely to attack strangers who come to see them, than members of the\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     To Subdue the Anger of Bees.\r\n\r\nI have tested every means recommended for subduing the anger of bees,\r\nand have found tobacco smoke the thing, when rightly applied.\r\n\r\nHave a tin-worker make you a tin tube, one inch in diameter, six inches\r\nlong, and fit stoppers of soft wood closely in each end, two and three\r\ninches long respectively, with a hole through each, one-fourth inch\r\nin diameter. Fit one end of the longer stopper to hold in the mouth.\r\nBefore placing the shorter piece in the tube, cover the inside end with\r\nwire cloth, bent a little convex, to prevent the ashes and tobacco\r\nfilling the quarter-inch orifice. Taper the outer end of the short\r\npiece nearly to a point. Remove the mouth-piece, and fill the tube\r\nnearly full of tobacco (cigars are best, for they burn freely.) Dip\r\nwith live embers, replace the mouth-piece and blow the smoke from the\r\npointed end.\r\n\r\nWith this instrument smoke may be forced among the bees in any part\r\nof the hive or boxes. _In all operations likely to arouse the anger\r\nof the bees_, as taking off and putting on boxes, lifting out comb\r\nframes, putting on and taking off feeder, removing the honey board,\r\nexamining the rearing boxes in queen raising, etc., smoke the hive\r\nwell. In-short, use smoke _freely_ when about to perform any operation\r\nupon the bees. Before touching the hive give the bees two or three\r\nsmart puffs at each entrance of the hive; then commence your operations\r\nimmediately. If the honey board is over the brood section, and your\r\noperations are to be performed in that part of the hive, raise the\r\nboard just enough to puff in the smoke, but not enough for the bees to\r\ncome out. Give them the smoke here freely for about one minute, before\r\nyou remove the board. They will show their submission by a loud humming\r\nthroughout the hive. When they set up this humming noise is the time\r\nto proceed with your work. Remove the honey board entirely, keeping\r\nthe smoker at hand ready for use, and giving them a puff of smoke\r\noccasionally _to keep them under submission_.\r\n\r\nIt is best for the inexperienced bee raiser to protect the hands and\r\nface in all operations, at least until he feels perfect confidence in\r\nhis ability to avoid irritating the bees sufficiently to cause them\r\nto sting. To protect the hands, wear thick woolen mittens, with very\r\nlong wrists, so they will come up over the dress or coat sleeve, thus\r\nprotecting the hands and wrists completely from stings. To protect the\r\nface and neck, get coarse black lace, one-half yard wide and a yard and\r\na quarter in length. Take three-fourths of this piece for the front\r\nbreadth, and the balance for the back breadth. Seam together at the\r\nselvedges, and gather the upper edge on an elastic cord so as to fit\r\nclosely, and draw around the crown of the hat When putting on the hat\r\nready for use, leave the longer part in front, to button beneath the\r\ncoat or vest of a gentleman or the sack of a lady. At the back the lace\r\ntucks beneath the collar. Thus protected, we are perfectly safe from\r\nstings, and can see as well, and perform all operations nearly as well,\r\nas when uncovered.\r\n\r\nThe best antidote for stings is the application of water in which\r\nsalt has been dissolved--a heaping teaspoonful of salt to a teacupful\r\nof water. Bathe the affected part freely, and in severe cases take\r\na swallow of the salt and water into the stomach. Avoid rubbing or\r\nirritating the stung part. Be sure to extract the sting immediately, as\r\nthe longer it remains the more serious will be the consequences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n                             THE BEE MOTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN some localities the bee moth is said to be very destructive, yet I\r\nregard the depredations of this insect as much less to be feared than\r\nsome bee-keepers suppose. The bee moth is the agency provided by nature\r\nfor returning back to the earth the contents of any hive when left by\r\nthe bees, in the same manner that the flesh fly is the means provided\r\nfor returning to the earth the carcase of any animal.\r\n\r\nI do not believe that a strong, healthy stock of bees was ever attacked\r\nand destroyed by the bee moth. The stock must from some cause become\r\nreduced in numbers, so there are not bees enough to cover all the comb,\r\nbefore the moth will make an attack. But when the comb is unprotected,\r\nthe moth follows the instinct of its nature, and deposits her eggs in\r\nit. The bees from some cause keep decreasing, and the moth continues\r\ndepositing her eggs in the vacated comb, until the entire comb of the\r\nhive is a complete mass of vile worms, the progeny of the bee moth.\r\n\r\nAbout this time the bee keeper notices for the first time, (for, if he\r\nis keeping bees on the old plan, he lets them take their own course,\r\nbelieving if he meddles with them, they will \"run out,\") that something\r\nis wrong with that hive. So he examines them, and finds the combs a\r\nmass of webs, with hundreds of moth millers among the combs, and the\r\ncombs themselves filled with vile worms. \"Ah!\" he says, \"the bee moth\r\nhas destroyed that swarm of bees;\" when in fact the bee moth had no\r\nmore to do with bringing about the loss than the maggots, found in the\r\ncarcase of a nice lamb destroyed by dogs, had to do with destroying the\r\nlife of the animal. \"Oh,\" says some wise bee keeper, \"I know better\r\nthan that, for I have seen the bee moth flying about my hives and\r\ntrying to get in.\" Very well; I have seen the flesh fly circling about\r\nlive animals, but think you there was any danger from them, as long as\r\nthe animal was in health? Not a bit. Neither is there any danger from\r\nthe bee moth, if you keep your stocks of bees _strong and healthy_.\r\nBut if you have weak or diseased stock, or have honey in boxes in warm\r\nweather _unprotected by the bees_, look out for the bee moth.\r\n\r\nFumigate with sulphur all combs taken from hives in warm weather;\r\nimmediately after which, seal up closely in well-made hives or boxes,\r\nto prevent access by the moth miller. All combs taken out _late in the\r\nfall_, and kept through the winter in a place where they will be liable\r\nto freeze, may be sealed up so the moth cannot gain access to them,\r\nand the contents will keep safely through the next summer. Freezing\r\ndestroys the vitality of the moth eggs. Fumigating with sulphur, as\r\ndirected in \"Care of Box Honey in Warm Weather,\" will destroy the _moth\r\nworms_, and prevent damage to the combs, if they receive attention\r\nwithin a few days after the eggs are hatched; but if the worms are\r\nsuffered to remain for any considerable length of time, the combs\r\nwill be badly damaged, if not entirely ruined. In protecting honey or\r\nempty comb from the bee moth in warm weather, every bee keeper should\r\nrecollect that eternal vigilance is the price of success! With the\r\nControllable Hive and new system of bee management, the true condition\r\nof stocks is known at all times. The stocks are very populous in July\r\nand August, which is the time the bee moth is most numerous about the\r\nhives. I never had a stock damaged by the bee moth since I adopted my\r\npresent system of bee management.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n                               ROBBING.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOSS of stocks by robbing shows carelessness, or a lack of knowledge\r\nas to the proper care of bees. Not one strong, healthy stock of bees\r\nin a thousand will be robbed, if proper precaution is taken. During a\r\ncopious yield of honey there is very little danger of robbing. When\r\nthere is a slack in the yield, the bees will search about for plunder,\r\nand if a weak stock is found, they will be very likely to attack it.\r\n\r\nIt is the duty of every intelligent bee-keeper to know the exact\r\ncondition of his stocks at all times, and if from any cause he has a\r\nweak stock, be sure to ascertain the cause of their weakness, and if\r\nthey are healthy stocks, contract the entrances, in accordance with the\r\nnumber of bees to pass. But if they are found to be diseased, remove\r\nthem. The bee, like the human race, is much better able to defend\r\nitself against the attacks of an enemy when there is but one avenue of\r\napproach, than if there are several.\r\n\r\nNo refuse honey should be placed in the open air, accessible to all\r\nthe bees alike, as this would be very likely to create a desire for\r\nplunder, and incite robbing.\r\n\r\nNever, when a stock is being robbed, change it from one stand to\r\nanother a few rods distant, to prevent robbing; for this is a very\r\ngreat injury to the stock, as all the bees that have marked the\r\nlocation (at the season when robbing will most likely occur,) will\r\nreturn to the old stand, and be lost. The best remedy, or rather\r\npreventative against robbing, is to contract the entrances to the\r\nhive. After bees have once commenced robbing, and have been successful\r\nin capturing and plundering one stock, they will, as soon as they\r\nhave secured the honey from that one, attack some other with great\r\nimpetuosity. Success in plundering renders them very courageous; but if\r\nyou have contracted the entrances as directed, they will be very likely\r\nto meet their match, and learn a good lesson. A little punishment is\r\nnecessary to teach them their proper place.\r\n\r\nI knew one of these old wise-heads--such a one as spoken of in the\r\nchapter on \"Swarming and Hiving\"--to use his familiar logic: \"What he\r\ndidn't know about bees wasn't worth knowing. He didn't want any book\r\nlarnin' to know how to keep bees; he had allers kept 'em, and his\r\nfather before him.\" Well, this Mr. Wiseman found, or thought he had\r\nfound, that his neighbor's bees were robbing his stocks. \"Zounds!\" says\r\nhe, \"I'll fix 'em!\" So he goes early in the morning, before the bees\r\nare flying, and confines his stock, which he thought was being robbed,\r\nby nailing a piece of board closely over each entrance to the hive, so\r\nno bees could pass in or out. About sunrise; or a little later, the\r\nrobber bees begin to collect on the front of his hive, seeking to gain\r\naccess. He waits until a quart or more have collected, and then he\r\ntakes two or three quarts of boiling water, and dashes it upon them.\r\nThis he continues through that day, and the next, at intervals, as\r\noften as there are any bees collected on the front of his hive. During\r\nthis time he has killed more than _a half bushel of bees_. The third\r\nday he opens his hive, but to his great surprise, _no bees appear_, and\r\non examination he finds the bees all dead. They had _suffocated_. Want\r\nof air, and the boiling water upon the hive, had destroyed them. And to\r\ncrown all, and make his loss still more severe, he found it was his\r\nown bees that were engaged in plundering his stock, and his neighbor's\r\nbees had nothing to do with it. The vast number of bees slaughtered\r\nwith the hot water, so reduced in numbers several of his stocks, that\r\nthey never recovered, but fell prey to the moth miller that season.\r\nAnd that was the way he \"fixed 'em.\" There are so many whims and false\r\nnotions about bees, that great care should be exercised in adopting\r\nplans recommended by inexperienced bee keepers, or that class who claim\r\nto know everything about bees, yet by their practice show that they\r\nknow very little.\r\n\r\nThere is one other plan, aside from contracting the entrance, which\r\nwill prove successful, but which is a little more trouble to apply. If\r\nyou find a stock is being robbed, look them over, and be sure that they\r\nhave a fertile, healthy queen. If the queen is found to be all right,\r\nbut with few bees, take from this hive two comb frames filled with\r\ncomb, _with no eggs or brood_, and go to a populous stock, and exchange\r\nthese two combs for two others filled with brood. Select such as have\r\nmost of the brood sealed over, as you want that which will hatch the\r\nquickest. Put these two combs in the hive that is being robbed, fasten\r\nup the stock by putting wire cloth over the entrances, giving them air\r\nyet preventing the passage of bees.[7]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: It is well to confine the bees when a large number of\r\nrobbers are inside--a larger number if possible than the swarm itself,\r\nfor, being confined a few days, they will make that hive their home,\r\nand aid in defending its stores against other robbers with as much\r\nenergy as the bees of the original swarm.]\r\n\r\nWhen you put in the two frames with brood, if you find but little\r\nhoney in the hive--not enough to last the bees a month or more--put in\r\none frame containing honey. Put on the feeder and carry the hive to\r\na dark and quiet room, and fill the feeder with _pure, soft water_.\r\nLet the bees remain in this room four days; then about one hour before\r\nsunset, set them on the old stand, giving them their liberty, with the\r\nentrances to the hive contracted--the lower entrance closed entirely,\r\nand the upper one half closed. Intelligent bee keepers will readily\r\nunderstand why this plan should prove a success:--First, the bees\r\nthat hatch from the brood comb given the weak stock, will be a great\r\nencouragement to the few bees in the hive; and in a _very few days_\r\nthey will aid in defending the hive against the attacks of robbers.\r\nAgain--removing the hive from the stand seems to disorganize the\r\nrobbers, for after they have visited the stand for several days, and\r\nfind no plunder, they will give up the search in that direction.\r\n\r\nBefore taking the trouble to remove a hive as here directed, care\r\nshould be taken to be _certain_ that the bees are being robbed. You\r\ncan be sure whether it is your own bees or others that are robbing, by\r\nsprinkling them with flour as they come from the hive which you suspect\r\nis being robbed, and watching your other hives, to see if those you\r\nhave marked enter them, being very careful that you are not deceived by\r\nthe dust from some species of blossoms, which adheres to the body of\r\nthe bee, and might be mistaken for the flour.\r\n\r\nBees when plundering a stock will often keep at their work until dark,\r\nsome of them being unable to find their hive by reason of the darkness.\r\nHonest workers are not found abroad at that time, and, by the way, this\r\nis a very good test of robbing. In concluding this chapter, I advise\r\nagain: _Know the condition of your stocks at all times._ If any have\r\ntoo few bees, contract the entrances in accordance with that number of\r\nbees to pass. Preventative is much better than cure in this case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n                        PROFITS OF BEE KEEPING.\r\n\r\n\r\nTWENTY-FIVE years ago, and even at the present time, by the ordinary\r\nmethods of bee keeping, if a profit of five dollars from one hive of\r\nbees in one season was gained it was considered \"good luck.\" You know\r\nthere is no system in the ordinary methods of bee keeping. It is either\r\n\"good luck\" or \"bad luck;\"--all \"luck\" and \"chance,\" anyway.\r\n\r\nIn one year they get five dollars profit from a stock of bees; the next\r\nhoney season they get nothing, and the bees all die in the winter; or\r\nperhaps they will survive that winter, and the next season swarm, and\r\nfly away to the woods; or perhaps refuse to swarm, and remain idly\r\nclustered on the front of the hive throughout the entire honey season,\r\nand die from want of food before the winter is half gone.\r\n\r\nBee keeping by the ordinary methods is a very precarious and uncertain\r\noccupation. The profits are small at best, and losses large and\r\nfrequent.\r\n\r\nWith my Controllable Hive and common sense system of bee management\r\n(as described in this work,) founded on correct and scientific\r\nprinciples, bee keeping is reduced to a science. There is no \"luck,\"\r\nno \"guess-work,\" no \"chance\" about it. There can be no loss in bee\r\nkeeping without a cause; there can be no gain without a _full and\r\ncorrect_ understanding of the natural habits and requirements of bees.\r\nA _correct knowledge_ of the subject insures success.\r\n\r\nI will now present a few statements, exhibiting the practical results\r\nwhich follow the use of my Controllable Hive and new system of bee\r\nmanagement, and showing the great contrast in profits and general\r\nsuccess in the care of bees.\r\n\r\nIn the season of 1870, one of my hives of native bees yielded two\r\nhundred and fifty-three pounds of surplus honey, in glass boxes, from\r\nthe 20th of May to the 1st of July. In 1875 _one hive yielded three\r\nhundred and eighty pounds of surplus honey in glass boxes during the\r\nseason_. This was the largest yield I ever had, and shows what is\r\npossible by liberal feeding with a thrifty stock of bees, giving them\r\nevery facility, with a view of securing the largest possible amount of\r\nsurplus box honey. In this case, I selected, in early spring, the very\r\nbest stock I could find, and pushed it as hard as possible throughout\r\nthe entire spring, summer and early fall. My success exceeded even my\r\nmost sanguine expectations. As it may serve to aid others in producing\r\nlarge yields of honey, I will describe minutely the method pursued to\r\nsecure this large and extraordinary yield.\r\n\r\nVery early in the spring I selected the most populous stock in my\r\npossession. It was ruled by a young and exceedingly prolific Hybrid\r\nqueen, a mixture of Italian and Native blood. I commenced early in\r\nthe spring to feed this stock lightly but _regularly_, every day at\r\nevening. I fed about one-half pound of feed per day, until a few days\r\nbefore the flowers were in bloom profusely! This was done to encourage\r\nbreeding. Very early in the spring they were fed com and rye meal, as\r\ndirected in this work.\r\n\r\nFor a few days before the flowers were blooming profusely, I fed\r\nliberally--in fact, gave them all I could possibly induce them to take\r\nup; the object being to get the store comb in the body of the hive,\r\nnot occupied with brood, completely filled with honey. The glass boxes,\r\ntwenty-six in number (with the Feeder,) each holding about four and\r\none-half pounds of honey, were arranged in connection with the hive\r\n(sides and top,) several weeks prior to the appearance of the flowers,\r\nthat the bees might become accustomed to them, and the more readily\r\nenter them, and commence work. When I ceased feeding (which was on the\r\nappearance of the flowers yielding a good supply of honey,) the boxes\r\nwere filled with bees, and comb-building had commenced. The hive was at\r\nthis time filled to overflowing with bees, and the combs had brood in\r\nall stages of growth, from the egg to the perfect bee. I had taken the\r\nprecaution to cut out nearly all the drone comb, and fit in its place\r\nworker comb, so I had but very few drones to consume the honey. I had\r\nalso arranged so as to have no increase by swarming, but to have all\r\nthe bees employed storing surplus honey in the boxes throughout the\r\nseason.\r\n\r\nAs fast as the boxes were filled, they were removed, and empty ones\r\nsubstituted in their place. I never saw bees work with such determined\r\nindustry, early and late, and in all kinds of weather. When honey\r\nfailed at the end of the season, there was a set of boxes on the hive\r\npartially filled. I immediately gave the bees feed until these too were\r\nfinished. I found, on weighing the product of this hive in the fall,\r\nthat they had given me a fraction over three hundred and eighty pounds\r\nof surplus honey in boxes. This honey I sold at thirty-five cents a\r\npound, a little over one hundred and thirty-three dollars, for surplus\r\nhoney sold from this one stock. Reader, go thou and do likewise.\r\n\r\nI had one stock of bees which occupied the same stand, winter and\r\nsummer, for six years, and during that time they swarmed but once, and\r\nfrom it I sold every year over fifty dollars' worth of surplus honey\r\nin glass boxes. A neighbor several times offered me fifty dollars for\r\nthis stock, early in the spring before the bees commenced their labors.\r\n\r\nIn 1874 I purchased a swarm of bees in an old box hive. They had not\r\npaid their owner a dollar in profit for years. Some seasons they would\r\nswarm and fly away to the woods; in other seasons they would remain\r\nclustered on the front of the hive through the entire season, refusing\r\nto swarm, or enter the two small boxes covered with a cap on top of the\r\nhive. I transferred the bees from this hive to the Controllable Hive,\r\nand they gave me a profit of over forty dollars the first year.\r\n\r\nI sold my honey in 1874 for from thirty-three to thirty-five dollars\r\nper hundred gross weight--that is, no tare deducted for weight of the\r\nbox. The boxes weigh each about one pound, empty, and when well filled\r\nwith honey about four and one-half pounds, gross.\r\n\r\nThe present season (1880.) one stock in a Controllable Hive, in\r\nthe month of June, without being fed or having extra care, yielded\r\nseventy-two pounds of surplus honey in glass boxes. Another, treated\r\nin the same manner, yielded over eighty pounds surplus, in the same\r\ntime. Another new swarm, since the first week in June, filled the brood\r\nframes with honey, and produced thirty-eight pounds of surplus in glass\r\nboxes, (filling eight boxes as full as they could be crowded,) and gave\r\nme a large swarm the last week in June.\r\n\r\nWhen box honey brings from thirty-three to thirty-five cents a pound,\r\n_gross weight_, my usual yearly average is a little over fifty dollars\r\nclean profit from the sale of box honey, from each stock of bees I\r\nkeep. I intend to keep about twelve stocks each season. I sometimes\r\nhave a much greater number; yet it is my purpose to keep only this\r\nnumber each season, for the production of surplus honey, swarms, etc.\r\nMy average yield of surplus box honey is about two hundred pounds\r\n(perhaps a trifle less) from each hive of bees that I keep, during each\r\nseason, _when swarming is prevented and each stock liberally fed_.\r\n\r\nI will here give the testimony of a few of the many, who have adopted\r\nthe plan of bee management recommended in this work. I should give\r\nthe name and post-office address of each, were it not for the fact\r\nthat they would receive so many letters of inquiry, as to make it very\r\ndisagreeable to them. _I have the original and complete letters in my\r\npossession, and such letters I am prepared to show at any time._ My\r\nobject in presenting this testimony here, is to show that the system of\r\nbee management recommended herein is not only successful with me, but\r\nwith all intelligent bee keepers, as well.\r\n\r\nA gentleman from Vermont writes me, under date of September 15, 1879,\r\nas follows: \"I take this opportunity of informing you of the experience\r\nI have had with the bee hive received from you. About the 10th of May I\r\ntransferred a swarm of bees from a box hive to the Controllable Hive.\r\nI transferred all the brood combs, and about eight or ten pounds of\r\nhoney. I fed them until flowers were plenty, which encouraged them to\r\nbuild rapidly. About the 25th of May I put in surplus boxes on the\r\nsides, which they soon entered, and went to work. The middle of June I\r\nput boxes on top, as the bees showed symptoms of swarming. By the 10th\r\nof July the side boxes were nearly all filled, and the bees were at\r\nwork in the top boxes. July 15th I took off sixteen of the twenty side\r\nboxes, well filled and capped, and placed empty ones in their places.\r\nAugust 5th, I took six of the ten boxes off the top, well filled. Then\r\nthe dry weather set in, and the bees came to a stand-still (thinking\r\nthe honey season over,) but the basswood revived it for a short time,\r\nenabling them to fill up the boxes pretty full. I obtained in all from\r\nthis swarm twenty-eight boxes, weighing one hundred and ten pounds. I\r\nshall have ten hives made this winter for use the coming spring.\"\r\n\r\nA gentleman writes from New York, under date of April 2d, 1879: \"I have\r\nreceived your hive, which meets my ideas of what a bee hive should be.\r\nIt contains all that is required in a bee hive, or in other words it\r\nis just the thing I have been wanting. I have been using the Quinby\r\nhive, so called, but I am now going to keep bees in earnest on your\r\nplan. I have the fullest confidence of success with your hive and plan\r\nof management. Your plan for wintering is a good one, on scientific\r\nprinciples, and the arrangement for feeding, and surplus honey, can't\r\nbe beat.\"\r\n\r\nA gentleman writes from New Hampshire, under date of April 26th, 1879:\r\n\"I have tested your hive, and my bees have done first-rate. I believe\r\nthe hive is just what it is represented. One strong reason why I think\r\nso much of your hive is, there were not a dozen bees died in the\r\nhive last winter, while three of my first swarms in other hives all\r\ndied--some of them with fifty pounds of honey in the hive. I have lost\r\nsome winters as many as fifteen or twenty swarms. I have now tested\r\nyour hive to my satisfaction, and I do not believe bees will die in it,\r\nif your instructions for wintering are carried out. I think your hive\r\nis what every bee keeper should have to make a success of bee keeping.\"\r\n\r\nA gentleman writes from Missouri, under date of May 1st, 1879: \"Your\r\nbee hive I like very much. I put in the swarm last season. They did\r\nmuch better than any swarm I had in the American hive. I took away\r\nmore surplus honey than from any of the others. I can recommend the\r\nControllable Hive to all bee keepers. This spring I have put up\r\nfourteen more Controllable Hives, and shall use no other hive in\r\nfuture.\"\r\n\r\nA lady bought a swarm of Italian bees of me in 1874, and from that one\r\nstock she increased to over twenty the third season, besides obtaining\r\nover one hundred pounds of nice surplus honey from the swarm I sent\r\nher in the first season.\r\n\r\nHere I desire to be clearly understood. I do not wish to hold out\r\ninducements which will never be realized, for the purpose of causing\r\nany one to commence bee keeping with unreasonable expectations of\r\nprofit. There is labor and care required to bring success in any\r\nenterprise; and usually the greater the care and labor bestowed on any\r\nbusiness, the greater the reward in profits. Bees give ample return for\r\neach little care and attention bestowed upon them; and if neglected and\r\npermitted to go uncared for, there is corresponding loss. I believe\r\nthat bee keeping on correct and scientific principles should be\r\nencouraged, until bees enough are kept to collect the honey now allowed\r\nto go to waste, and which, if collected, would add millions of dollars\r\nto the wealth of the country.\r\n\r\nThe statements of large yields of honey here presented, show what it\r\nis possible to do; yet no reasonable person would commence bee keeping\r\nwith the expectation of realizing, on each of a dozen or more stocks\r\nkept, the large yields above specified. Some stocks will pay a much\r\ngreater profit than others. And it is only under the most favorable\r\ncircumstances, with our very best stocks, that we secure the results\r\nhere named, such as three hundred and eighty pounds of box honey from\r\none stock in a season This serves to illustrate what may be derived\r\n(but not what we may reasonably expect) from each stock, where a dozen\r\nor more stocks are kept. Two hundred pounds from each stock on the\r\naverage is about right. And this last is only secured with good care\r\nand attention, perseverance and labor, judiciously applied to the work.\r\n\r\nThe question is often asked: \"How many stocks of bees can be kept in\r\none place on your plan?\" This depends on the number of honey-yielding\r\nplants and flowers. Some localities furnish a much greater number than\r\nothers. In some localities, fifty stocks would do well, and pay yearly\r\na handsome profit; in others, it would not be profitable to keep half\r\nas many. I am in a place said to be very unfavorable to bee keeping. I\r\nfind twelve stocks about the right number for me to maintain. Bees will\r\ngo seven miles or more to collect honey, but the shorter the distance,\r\nthe more honey will be collected, in a season; consequently the greater\r\nprofit will follow.\r\n\r\nIt can only be learned by practical test how many stocks of bees may be\r\nprofitably kept in any locality. Commence with a few, and increase the\r\nnumber moderately, until you find you have as many as you wish to keep,\r\nor as many as the locality will support, with good profit, when managed\r\njudiciously.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n                  CHANGING OLD QUEENS FOR YOUNG ONES.\r\n\r\n\r\nON my plan of bee management, if a stock does not change its queen\r\nfor three years in succession, the fourth season the old queen should\r\nbe taken away, if she shows the least sign of failing, and a young,\r\nlaying queen substituted in her place It often happens, if the queen\r\nin a stock dies or becomes seriously injured, that the bees will, of\r\ntheir own accord, rear another to take her place. But if her failure\r\nhas been gradual, the bees may not have the means to do so, when she\r\nat last fails entirely, for the reason that she may cease laying, for\r\nseveral days or weeks previous to her death, in which case it would\r\nbe impossible for the bees, without assistance, to rear another queen\r\nto take her place. They must have an egg not over five days old, from\r\nwhich to rear a queen. The great necessity of close observation, in\r\norder to keep each stock always supplied with a healthy, prolific\r\nqueen, cannot be impressed too strongly on the mind of every bee\r\nkeeper. Be sure not to neglect this very important point in successful\r\nand profitable bee keeping.\r\n\r\nBut very few seem to know the average duration of life of the honey\r\nbee. The average term of life of the worker is only a few months--not\r\nmore than from two to four--a great many do not live out half that\r\ntime. So it will be seen that it is only by keeping healthy and\r\nprolific queens in each stock, that we can have populous stocks, such\r\nas will pay a good profit.\r\n\r\nIn my experiments I have in several instances taken from a vigorous and\r\nvery populous stock their queen, and at the same time deprived them\r\nof the means of rearing another. This was done in the honey season.\r\nIn such cases the bees kept on with their labor, though with visible\r\nreluctance and an appearance of discouragement, the number of bees\r\ndecreasing very rapidly, and in from two to three months nearly all had\r\ndisappeared, not more than two or three hundred remaining, where there\r\nhad been from thirty thousand to fifty thousand all in a prosperous\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nOther instances have come under my observation, clearly showing that\r\nthe life of the worker honey bee is only of few months duration. One\r\ncase in fact will show: I removed the native queen from a very strong\r\nstock of native or black bees, in the honey season, and introduced an\r\nItalian queen, in order to change the stock from native to Italian. The\r\nreader will readily understand that every egg deposited by the Italian\r\nqueen, after her introduction, will produce the Italian variety, the\r\nworkers of which are entirely distinct in color from the natives. In\r\na few days after the introduction of the Italian queen I found the\r\nnatives were disappearing, and soon after the Italians began to appear.\r\nThe change was very rapid. In about two months not a native or black\r\nbee could be found about the hive--all were Italians. The natives had\r\ngradually decreased, until all had disappeared, showing conclusively\r\nthat they had died in the same ratio that they would have passed away\r\nfrom a stock naturally. During the winter season, as the bee is in a\r\ndormant state for the greater part of the time, they are given a longer\r\nlease of life.\r\n\r\nWhen it is discovered that a stock has a barren queen or has lost\r\nits queen, or from any cause she has ceased to be prolific (and in\r\nconsequence the bees are dwindling away,) take means immediately to\r\nsubstitute a prolific and healthy queen in her place, and at the\r\nsame time re-enforce the stock, by taking one or more frames filled\r\nwith hatching brood from a populous stock, and exchanging for those\r\ndestitute of brood. In this manner the bees will be increased so as\r\nto insure safety for a few days, after which the stock, having been\r\nfurnished with a prolific, healthy queen, will regain their former\r\nprosperity and vigor.\r\n\r\nThe queen being the mother of the entire swarm, and consequently all\r\nincrease being dependent on her, every intelligent bee keeper will\r\nreadily understand that in order to succeed, he must be sure that each\r\nstock has a prolific queen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n                    REARING AND INTRODUCING QUEENS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN commencing to rear queens, you will first want some small rearing\r\nboxes, or miniature hives, about four and one-half inches wide, by\r\neight inches long, and five inches deep, inside measurement. Use inch\r\nboard for the hives. Make for each hive three movable comb frames,[8]\r\nsuspended the same as in the brood section of the Controllable Hive.\r\nMake the under side of the top bar, flat, instead of triangular, as\r\nin the large comb frames. Take a piece of old comb, and cut to fill\r\neach one of these small frames. Take from a pint to a quart of bees\r\nfrom a populous stock (in the height of the breeding season this will\r\ndo no harm) without the queen-. Confine these bees in a light box, in\r\nthe top of which there is an inch hole, closed, to confine them to the\r\nbox, for if not confined they would return to the old stock, as the\r\nqueen is not with them. Having secured your bees in the box, go to a\r\nstock, and lift out a comb containing eggs, just deposited. They may be\r\nknown by their appearance. They are but a tiny speck at the bottom of\r\nthe cell, about one-sixteenth of an inch in length, slightly curved,\r\nand perfectly white in color. They remain in this form from two to\r\nthree days, at the end of which time they change to the form of a grub\r\nor maggot. After this change it is a risk to depend on them for queen\r\nraising, so be sure to secure for your purpose eggs. Cut from the brood\r\ncomb a piece about two inches long and one-half inch wide, using a very\r\nsharp, thin knife, so not to mutilate the comb. Cut out a piece from\r\nthe center comb of the miniature hive, and fit in its place the piece\r\ncontaining the eggs. The middle of a warm day is the best time to do\r\nthis work. It is best to have one of the comb frames of the miniature\r\nhive filled with honey, to furnish food for the bees for a few days.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: This frame is shown in the engraving representing the\r\ndifferent kinds of cells, in Chapter I.]\r\n\r\nAs soon as you have fitted the piece containing the eggs in its place\r\nin the miniature hive, put on a close-fitting cover. Do not nail it,\r\nas you will want to look at it every few days. Close the entrances to\r\nthe miniature hive, so no bees can escape. Now open the hole in the top\r\nof the box in which the bees are confined, and set the miniature hive\r\ncontaining the eggs over it quickly, allowing no bees to escape. The\r\nbees will then pass from the box up into the miniature hive, cluster\r\non the comb containing the eggs, and immediately commence the rearing\r\nof queens from the eggs thus furnished them. Keep the bees confined to\r\nthe miniature hive for about thirty-six hours. Give them their liberty\r\nat first about one hour before sunset. If you do not confine them for\r\nthe time stated, they will return to the hive from which you took them,\r\nbut if so confined, they will forget their old home, and adhere to the\r\nminiature hive, the same as an ordinary swarm hived in the usual way.\r\nThey will rear queens from the eggs given them by constructing queen\r\ncells, so arranged as to take in one of the eggs in the piece of comb\r\nfurnished them, often constructing three or more cells. In about six\r\ndays, open the miniature hive, and you will find these cells nearly\r\nor quite finished. Occasionally a case occurs where they do not rear\r\nqueens when thus furnished with the means, but such cases are rare.\r\nIf you find each one made separate, you can, if you choose, with a\r\nsharp, thin knife cut out all the cells but one, and give them to\r\nother rearing boxes not supplied with eggs, or which have failed to\r\nrear queens from the eggs furnished them. If you leave all the cells\r\nin the miniature hive as constructed, the first queen that hatches\r\nwill destroy all the others. She will visit each cell, gnaw an opening\r\nin the side, curve her abdomen and insert her sting into the opening,\r\nand sting the rival queen to death while yet in her cradle. The worker\r\nbees will then enlarge the opening, and drag out the lifeless body. The\r\nvictorious queen now reigns over the little colony, the same as in a\r\nlarge and natural swarm.\r\n\r\nIn from three to five days after hatching, if the weather is fine,\r\nthe young queen will leave the miniature hive, and take a flight in\r\nthe open air, to meet the drone for the purpose of fecundation. If\r\nsuccessful, she will commence to lay in about two days. She may then be\r\nintroduced to a full stock at any time desired. Recollect, it will be\r\nuseless to rear queens where there are no drones.\r\n\r\nWhen stocks are liberally fed early in the season, drones will appear\r\ncorrespondingly early. And if from a stock well supplied with drones,\r\nyou remove the queen, the workers will not destroy the drones in that\r\nhive until they have obtained another fertile laying queen. With this\r\nidea in view, viz:--early and liberal feeding to produce drones early,\r\nand depriving a populous stock (well supplied with drones) of its queen\r\nthe last of the season, we can have drones sufficient for our purpose\r\nfrom early spring until late in the fall.\r\n\r\nI have in several instances, for the purpose of securing drones\r\nvery early in the spring, deprived a populous stock, containing a\r\nlarge number of drones, of its queen, very late in the fall, and\r\nwintered them queenless. In this manner the drones were permitted by\r\nthe bees to remain and winter with the swarm. Early in the spring\r\nthey were re-enforced with hatching brood from populous stocks, but\r\nwere permitted to rear no queens, in order that the drones might be\r\npreserved. As soon as drones appeared in the other stocks, this stock\r\nwas furnished with a laying queen, and it was as prosperous as the best.\r\n\r\nBy this plan drones may be kept through the winter, if their services\r\nare required very early in the spring, before we can raise them from\r\nthe best stocks by judicious feeding, which very rarely can be done.\r\n\r\nThe bees for rearing queens are usually obtained from populous hives,\r\nsuch as will hardly miss a pint or a quart from their numbers, great\r\ncare being exercised not to remove the queen. The best time to get\r\nthe bees is in the middle of the day. Go to a stock and first find\r\nthe queen. Set the comb she is on, to one side. Put your light box\r\n(prepared as before described with a hole in the top) on a sheet near\r\nby, with one edge raised an inch. Take one or more combs from the hive\r\n(being careful not to get the one with the queen,) and shake the bees\r\nfrom them, down beside the box, which they will readily enter. When you\r\nhave bees enough in the box, close it so none can escape. You now have\r\nthe bees ready to put in the miniature hive, as before directed.\r\n\r\nI think I have given such instruction as will enable any one, after a\r\nlittle practice, to rear queens successfully.[9] I will follow it with\r\nsuch information as will insure success in introducing queens into full\r\nstocks of bees.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: By taking brood for rearing queens only from such stocks\r\nas exhibit the greatest industry, mildness of disposition, vigor in\r\nwithstanding the cold, etc., I find lam able to greatly improve the\r\ndesirable qualities of my bees from year to year. This systematic\r\ncourse of treatment has produced swarms possessing very valuable\r\ncharacteristics. It is surprising to note the difference in profits and\r\nease of management, between bees that have always been left to take\r\ntheir own course, and such as have had their most desirable traits\r\ncultivated and improved to the greatest possible extent for a term of\r\nyears. The difference is almost as marked as between the savage in his\r\nnative wilds, and the most intelligent and highly educated member of\r\nsociety.]\r\n\r\nHere let me caution bee keepers never to attempt to introduce a queen\r\ninto a full stock of bees, until she has begun to lay. A young queen,\r\nnot fecundated, will be destroyed in nine cases out of ten, in spite\r\nof every precaution. Before introducing a queen, the old queen in the\r\nstock, if any exists, must be taken away. Make your search for her in\r\nthe middle of the day, as at that time most of the workers are away.\r\nUse but very little smoke, and that only at the entrance, as the bees\r\nshould remain spread over the combs as evenly as possible. If you use\r\nmuch smoke they will rush to the bottom and the corners of the hive,\r\nand it is very likely the queen might seek a hiding-place with the\r\nothers, where you could not find her. If not disturbed, the queen will\r\nbe found in the comb among the bees. When ready to proceed, having\r\nsmoked them lightly at the entrances (a puff at each entrance is\r\nsufficient,) lift out the comb carefully, avoiding any jar, and look\r\nthem over for the queen. It is said the Italian queens are more readily\r\nfound than the natives, but I could never see any difference. Hold the\r\nframe up in front of your face, so as to have a good view, and look\r\neach comb over carefully till you find the queen. When found, remove\r\nher. Always return the combs so they will occupy the same position as\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the queen is removed, and the bees are aware of their loss,\r\nthey will usually commence to rear another queen from the worker eggs\r\nto take her place. To make a sure thing of it, they often start to\r\nproduce a half-dozen or more.\r\n\r\nIn six days after removing the queen, smoke the bees well, to get the\r\ncombs as clear of them as possible. Do this in the middle of the\r\nday. When you have driven the most of the bees from the comb to the\r\nbottom and into the corners of the hives, lift out the combs, and look\r\nsharply for queen cells, (success depends on thorough work here.) With\r\na sharp knife cut out and destroy every such cell that is finished\r\nor commenced. Don't leave any part of a queen cell in the hive, for\r\nthe bees will not accept a strange queen if they have the means of\r\nraising one of their own. Having destroyed every queen cell, finished\r\nor unfinished, return the combs to the hive; but before putting the\r\nhoney board over the brood section, cut a hole in it a little smaller\r\nthan the top of a tumbler. Cover this hole with a light piece of board,\r\nsimply laid on, (not nailed, for you will need to remove it without\r\njar.) Then put the honey board in its place over the brood section.\r\n\r\nLet the hive remain until near sunset, for the bees to get quiet, and\r\nto learn that they are without a queen and without the means of rearing\r\nanother. Just before sunset, take the queen you propose to introduce,\r\nand with her a score or more of workers, and put them in a tumbler\r\nwith a piece of wire cloth over the top to keep them in. (To get her\r\nfrom the miniature hive, where she was reared, to the tumbler, take it\r\nto a close room, before a window, so if she takes wing she may alight\r\nthere.) Go to the hive into which she is to be introduced, and remove\r\nthe cap, avoiding any jar that may irritate the bees. Take off the\r\nboard over the hole in the honey board, and turn the tumbler containing\r\nthe queen bottom up over it, keeping the wire cloth between the queen\r\nin the tumbler and the bees in the hive. Replace the cap to the hive,\r\nand let the queen and her attendant bees remain in the tumbler, in\r\ncommunication with the bees in the hive through the wire cloth, until\r\nthe next day, near sunset. Then take a teaspoonful of honey, go to the\r\nhive, and remove the cap, this time with the greatest possible care, as\r\nthe slightest jar will endanger success. Raise the tumbler carefully\r\nfrom off the queen, and with the honey smear her completely over, then\r\nturn the wire cloth over carefully, and let the queen and her attendant\r\nbees down through the hole in the honey board, among the bees of the\r\nhive. Replace the cap as quietly as possible, and the work is done. In\r\nabout one week examine the combs of this hive for eggs, and if they are\r\nfound, you can consider your work crowned with success. If no eggs are\r\ndiscovered, you must go over the ground again. But be sure there are no\r\neggs in the combs before you repeat the work.\r\n\r\nThis plan of introducing queens is the most successful of any I have\r\never tested. It rarely fails. When a laying queen is removed from one\r\nof the miniature hives, the bees will usually rear queens from the eggs\r\nleft when the queen is removed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n                           SOURCES OF HONEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE sources from which bees collect honey are various and almost\r\ninnumerable. Almost every flower, tree, plant, shrub and vine, in\r\nfield, forest, pasture and garden yield honey to some extent. White\r\nclover, is, perhaps, the greatest source of honey in the New England\r\nand Middle States, it being found to a greater or less extent in almost\r\nevery field and pasture. South and west there is, in many localities, a\r\nprofusion of wild flowers, producing considerable quantities of honey.\r\nIn some sections buckwheat affords a rich harvest. Basswood yields a\r\nvery nice quality of honey, and in sections where it abounds, great\r\nquantities are collected from it. Fruit blossoms--apple, pear, peach,\r\nand all the different varieties of plums, cherries, etc., are very\r\nimportant sources of honey.\r\n\r\nPollen is the first material gathered by the bees in early spring.\r\nSeveral varieties of alder, willow, red maple, etc., produce pollen\r\nin great abundance. Raspberry, blackberry, catnip, dandelion, etc.,\r\nall contribute largely of honey in their season. Corn, and most kinds\r\nof grain, furnish pollen in abundance late in the season. Mustard and\r\nsweet clover are great favorites with the busy bee, yielding the most\r\nbeautiful honey, clear as crystal and white as snow. The sugar maple\r\nproduces honey of excellent quality, and where forests of this tree\r\nabound, large quantities of honey are stored, while it is in blossom\r\nin early spring.[10] Locust, whitewood, mignonette, golden rod, sumach,\r\netc., all produce honey. When we take into consideration the fact that\r\nthe bee will go seven miles or more to collect his sweets, it is easy\r\nto understand that a certain number of swarms will succeed in almost\r\nany locality, even without feeding. To make this still more clear,\r\nwe have only to take into account the vast number of honey yielding\r\nflowers, trees, plants, shrubs, etc., within a circle of fourteen miles\r\nin diameter, the hives occupying the center, and the bees flying to\r\ncollect honey seven miles in every direction from the hive. Those who\r\nhave not tested the matter, will be likely to dispute the statement,\r\nthat a bee will go seven miles to gather honey. But on this point\r\nI am able to offer ample proof, to establish, beyond a reasonable\r\ndoubt, the fact that the Italian bee will go that distance. The proof\r\nI offer is this: The first Italian bees brought into the New England\r\nStates, I had the honor of receiving. The Italian bees being entirely\r\ndistinct from the native or black bees in color and size, I determined\r\nto avail myself of the opportunity offered to satisfy myself on the\r\nlong-disputed question--\"How far a bee will go to collect honey.\" I\r\ntherefore made close and repeated examinations, at different times\r\nduring the honey season, and it was no uncommon occurrence, to find\r\nthe Italian workers seven miles from their hives. As there were no\r\nItalian bees except mine within hundreds of miles, I considered this\r\npositive proof that that variety will travel seven miles from its hive\r\nin its search for honey-producing flowers. As the native or black bee\r\nis, to some extent, found in all parts of the country, it is impossible\r\nto prove conclusively the distance they will go from the hive; yet my\r\nobservations give very strong evidence that they journey five miles or\r\nmore after honey.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: Climate and soil are so variable, it is impossible to\r\ngive the sources of honey so as to apply minutely to every locality. I\r\nshall strive to designate the principal sources. The bee keeper will\r\nvery soon learn from experience and observation, what are the principal\r\nsources of honey in that particular locality. Many different flowers,\r\ntrees and shrubs are found in one section yielding honey profusely\r\nwhich do not exist in another.]\r\n\r\nWhen the distance a bee will go for honey is so well established, and\r\nhaving found from repeated tests that the flowers, when yielding honey,\r\nmay be visited many times each day by the bee, and yield at each visit\r\na bountiful supply, we can form some idea of the vast amount of honey\r\nnow permitted to go to waste, which might be collected by bees and\r\nstored in nice boxes, and thus add wealth and enjoyment to the human\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nThe bee keeper sometimes finds his bees idle, when the flowers are in\r\nbloom in profusion, the sun shining brightly, and, to the superficial\r\nobserver, everything indicating honey in abundance. And yet the bees\r\nare dormant, and scarcely a one flying about the hives, notwithstanding\r\nthe hives and boxes are full of them. The truth of the matter is, there\r\nis no honey in the flowers, although they are in full bloom. The air\r\nis dry and clear. Suddenly there is a change, the atmosphere becomes\r\nmoist and charged with electricity, with occasionally light showers.\r\nImmediately all is activity about the hives. The greatest show of\r\nindustry is manifested; scores of workers, and in some cases a hundred,\r\ncoming into each hive every minute, loaded with honey, many of them so\r\nheavily weighted that they fall to the ground before they reach the\r\nhive, where they rest a moment, and then try again, usually succeeding\r\nin entering with their load. I have seen a change, as here described,\r\nbrought about in a half-hour's time in the middle of the day, viz: The\r\nbees pass from an idle, almost entirely dormant state, to the greatest\r\nactivity and industry. And all because a change in the atmosphere had\r\ncaused the flowers to secrete honey. The question arises. How did the\r\nbees know at that particular hour there was a change, and that the\r\nflowers, which a few minutes before were destitute of honey, were now\r\nbountifully supplied? I answer, the bee was aware of the change almost\r\nthe moment it took place. The bee is very sensitive to all atmospheric\r\nchanges. A case in point will show this: The bees are collecting honey\r\nabroad in the fields. The day is warm and balmy. Suddenly there is\r\nthe appearance of a shower, and distant thunder is heard. Immediately\r\nthe bees came rushing in from the fields, in clouds. They cover the\r\nentire front of their hives, in their eagerness to gain a shelter from\r\nthe approaching rain. Again, if the morning is cloudy and dark, with\r\nevery appearance of rain, and you find the bees leaving their hives\r\nfor the fields, you may be quite certain that rain is not near, and\r\nmay expect soon to see the sun break forth and the clouds disperse.\r\nIf, on the other hand there is an appearance of rain, and the bees are\r\nquiet in their hives, it is quite sure to rain in a very short time.\r\nHow wonderful are the workings of nature. How great the sagacity of the\r\nlittle, busy bee. Who dares say that this wonderful little insect does\r\nnot possess the power of reasons? But I am digressing from the subject.\r\n\r\nBees, in their journeys to collect honey, seldom visit more than one\r\nspecies of flower, plant or shrub, at one excursion; and this is a wise\r\nprovision of nature, for were it otherwise, and any and all species\r\nvisited promiscuously, the vegetable world would be thrown into chaos,\r\nby the fertilizing dust of one species being imparted to another,\r\nthrough the medium of the bee.\r\n\r\nPollen as fast as collected is deposited in little basket-like cavities\r\non the inside of the bee's posterior legs. It is packed in little\r\npellets, varying in size from that of a pin's head to a small pea. In\r\ncolor it is usually yellow, but sometimes green or red. Hundreds of\r\nbees may be seen entering the hives with pollen at almost any time in\r\nthe honey season, particularly in the morning before the dew is off\r\nthe grass. It is easier for the bees to collect it at this time, as\r\nthe moisture causes it the more readily to adhere to the cavities of\r\nthe legs. Honey when collected is deposited in the stomach of the bee,\r\nin which it is borne to the hive, and there deposited in cells in the\r\ncomb. The bee has the power of raising this honey from its stomach, in\r\nthe same manner that all ruminating animals raise the cud.\r\n\r\nSome have contended that bees cause an injury to all kinds of fruit,\r\nsuch as apples, peaches, plums, etc., by taking away the substance and\r\nsweetness, in the form of honey, which otherwise would be absorbed, and\r\neaten with the fruit. This is a great mistake. The provisions of nature\r\nare wise in this respect as in all others. There is the strongest\r\nevidence to prove that honey, once secreted in the cups of the tiny\r\nblossoms, never returns to the flower or fruit, but evaporates and\r\npasses into the air. Who, in passing an apple or peach orchard in full\r\nbloom, has not noticed the delicious fragrance; which is undoubtedly\r\nhoney which has evaporated from the myriads of blossoms. It is very\r\nplain to the close observer that nature has placed in the cups of\r\nflowers this honey, expressly as food for the honey bee, and that it is\r\nin harmony with all her great and wonderful works.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n                          LOCATION OF HIVES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN locating your hives, place them on the south side of buildings, or a\r\nclose board fence facing south, south-east or south-west. If possible,\r\nlocate in the shade of some trees, where they Will be shaded from the\r\nsun from nine o'clock in the forenoon until one in the afternoon, or a\r\nlittle later. If no trees afford shade, arrange a roof over each hive,\r\nwhich shall shade the entire hive, and especially the front, in the\r\nsummer season. But in spring and fall it is better to let the bees have\r\nthe full benefit of the sun's rays, shining directly upon the hive.\r\nConstruct a separate stand for each hive, as follows: Cut boards about\r\nthree feet long, and joists three by six inches square (two pieces of\r\nthe latter two feet long;) nail the ends of the boards to these pieces,\r\nso as to form a stand, when placed on the ground, three feet long, two\r\nfeet wide and six inches high. This gives a free circulation of air\r\nbeneath the stand. Set your hive on this stand, the rear of the hive\r\neven with the rear of the stand, which leaves the stand projecting a\r\nfoot or more in front, making an admirable place for the bees to alight\r\nbefore entering the hive. Set your stands three feet apart, and make\r\nthem perfectly level before placing your hive upon them.\r\n\r\nPlace an alighting board in front of each hive. Get a board about\r\neighteen inches wide and two feet long. Nail on some cleats at each\r\nend, to prevent warping. Rest one edge of this board on the ground,\r\nthe other edge on the end of the platform in front of the hive. By\r\nthis arrangement many bees will be saved in early spring which would\r\notherwise be lost. By the old plan of setting the hives two or three\r\nfeet high, with no alighting board, and a free draught of wind beneath,\r\nthe loss of bees was very great, especially in the early spring\r\nmonths, on chilly afternoons following a very warm forenoon. The bees,\r\nreturning loaded with pollen, are unable to reach a hive placed so\r\nhigh, and are blown to the earth by the hundreds, and becoming chilled,\r\ndie. The death of a few bees is a great loss in early spring, for they\r\nare required in keeping up the animal heat in the hive to forward\r\nbreeding.\r\n\r\nThe location of bees as here recommended will be found greatly superior\r\nto any other, for other reasons than those mentioned, and which are too\r\nnumerous to herein specify.\r\n\r\nEvery one who commences bee keeping should ever remember, that bees\r\nalways mark the location of their hives. The young bee the first time\r\nit leaves the hive invariably does this. The same is true with all\r\nswarms, in the first flight in early spring, after being dormant in the\r\nhive through the winter months.\r\n\r\nIn marking the location, the bee comes from the hive, and at the\r\nentrance rises on the wing. Turning its head toward the hive, it\r\nrecedes in circles, backward, at first describing a circle so small\r\nas to be scarcely perceptible, but enlarging as the distance from the\r\nhive is increased. They thus take into view all objects surrounding\r\nthe hive, so that they are able to return to their own hives without\r\ndifficulty. After one or two excursions begun in this manner, the\r\nbee leaves the hive in a direct line for the fields, without taking\r\nany further precaution whatever, and returns by its knowledge of the\r\nobjects in the vicinity of the hives, without difficulty.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding there might be a hundred hives standing in a line,\r\nwith only a few inches space between each, and all of the same color\r\nand appearance, if left to itself no bee would enter the hive of its\r\nneighbor, although there might be hundreds of thousands of the busy\r\nworkers, from all the hives, dying promiscuously about in the air.\r\nEach bee knows its own hive perfectly, and if from any accident it\r\nenters its neighbor's house, immediate death is usually the result;\r\nor possibly it may escape, after being roughly handled, and made to\r\nunderstand that it is trespassing on forbidden ground.\r\n\r\nSome bee keepers, with little knowledge of their occupation, often\r\nremove a hive of bees several rods, in the working season. The result\r\nis, all the bees that had marked the location (and all the old bees\r\nhad done this) are lost. They would continue to leave the hive in a\r\ndirect line, after its removal, not taking the precaution to mark the\r\nlocation, as they were unaware of the change, and when they were ready\r\nto return, they would return to the former place.\r\n\r\nBees may be safely moved a dozen miles or more, at any time, as this\r\ntakes them beyond their knowledge of country; but in such cases set\r\nthe hives six feet apart at least. If this precaution is not taken and\r\nthe hives are set close together, the bees will rush from the hives\r\non being let out, not knowing the location has been changed, and when\r\nthey return, many will enter the wrong hive, and be slaughtered without\r\nmercy.\r\n\r\nTherefore, let stocks be placed, early in the spring, before they have\r\nmarked the situation of the stands they are to occupy for the summer,\r\nand not change them after the bees have commenced their labors--at\r\nleast change them no less distance than twelve miles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n                            WINTERING BEES.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE subject of wintering bees is of the greatest importance, and one\r\nwhich is generally very imperfectly understood, if we may judge from\r\nthe large number of swarms lost every winter and spring. There are many\r\nmethods recommended as \"the best\" for wintering bees. One will tell\r\nyou to keep them cold; another to keep them warm. One will say, put\r\nthem in the cellar; another, bury them in the ground; another put them\r\nin the attic. Is it any wonder that the beginner becomes confused and\r\ndisgusted at so much conflicting advice? That bees have been wintered\r\nsafely by any and all of these old plans I shall not dispute. But I am\r\ncertain that neither plan will, alone, prove successful in the majority\r\nof cases.\r\n\r\nBy all the methods heretofore recommended, a large number of bees die\r\nfrom each stock, during the winter; so reducing them in numbers that it\r\ntakes nearly the entire summer for them to regain in numbers what they\r\nhave lost; while a very large number of stocks are lost entirely.\r\n\r\nIt will be readily understood that the greater the number of bees in a\r\nhive in early spring, the more warmth will be generated; consequently\r\nthe more rapidly will the brood mature and the bees increase in\r\nnumbers. It is of the greatest importance to have strong stocks in\r\nearly spring This is one of the strong points of the new system of\r\nmanagement, taught in this book.\r\n\r\nIn nearly all the hives now in use, there is no proper ventilation,\r\nconsequently the honey in such hives becomes sour, the comb mouldy,\r\nand the bees diseased. It is impossible, in our variable climate, to\r\nwinter bees successfully, for any number of years, with any degree of\r\ncertainty, in the great majority of the ordinary hives.\r\n\r\nSome, who have met with heavy losses in winter, have taken the ground\r\nthat the loss was caused by a poor quality of honey, stored by the bees\r\nin a wet season, or a large yield late in the fall. But this is a great\r\nmistake. Bees will not collect and store honey not suited to their use\r\nas food; they make no mistakes on this point.\r\n\r\nI might discuss in detail all the different methods of wintering bees,\r\nand show the great losses attending each, with causes, etc., but by so\r\ndoing I should consume more space than I can give in this work. I shall\r\ntherefore confine my remarks to ordinary conditions of bees in winter,\r\nand the requisites to insure uniform success in wintering.\r\n\r\nIn the winter bees cluster as closely together as circumstances admit,\r\nand the severity of the cold demands. The more severe the cold, the\r\ncloser they cluster together, in order the better to keep up the animal\r\nheat necessary to maintain life.\r\n\r\nBy all the old methods, the cluster of bees is divided by the sheets of\r\ncomb, which is a great hindrance to successful wintering. In such cases\r\nthe bees cannot cluster compactly together, but are spread out between\r\nthe different sheets of comb. In the Controllable Hive, and on the plan\r\nof wintering here recommended, the bees in very cold weather cluster\r\nin the space between the wire cloth of the ventilator and the top of\r\nthe frames of the brood section. They are here able to keep up the\r\nrequired amount of animal heat, as they can cluster compactly, without\r\nanything to separate them.\r\n\r\nBy the ordinary plan, in sudden turns of very cold weather, the bees\r\nbetween the outer combs are often frozen to death. \"Oh!\" says some\r\none, \"that's all humbug; you can't freeze a bee.\" Certainly you can.\r\nTo satisfy yourself of this, after a very cold turn of weather, look\r\nunder your box hives, if you have them, or any patent hive having a\r\nloose bottom board to admit of an examination, and see if you do not\r\nfind hundreds of bees which have fallen dead from the outside combs.\r\nI have examined hundreds of stocks, and found them as here described.\r\nIf you don't believe a bee will freeze, take out a dozen from a hive,\r\nin a severely cold spell of weather in mid-winter, confine them in a\r\nbox, and set them out doors, letting them remain only one night. See if\r\nthey are not dead beyond resuscitation, the next morning. This notion\r\nthat bees will not freeze is a great mistake, and has led to some very\r\nfoolish experiments in wintering them.\r\n\r\nA swarm of bees of average size, put in proper condition for winter,\r\nwill not freeze; but from this it does not follow that a bee is\r\nproof against the greatest possible degree of cold. When bees are\r\nprepared for winter, as herein directed, they will, as before stated,\r\ncluster compactly together. And as the cold increases the cluster\r\nwill contract, in accordance with the increasing of the cold, and\r\nconsequently no loss of bees occur.\r\n\r\nAnother great cause of loss in winter is in proper ventilation, or\r\nno ventilation at all. Every swarm of bees throws off a considerable\r\namount of moisture from their bodies. In very cold weather, if the\r\nhive is not properly ventilated, this moisture collects on the combs\r\nat the sides and top of the hives, in the form of frost and ice. In\r\nmoderate weather this frost and ice melts, and runs down into the\r\nhive, completing saturating the bees, and then, if a sudden change to\r\nextremely cold weather takes place, all are destroyed by freezing; or\r\nif they chance to survive the winter, the moisture causes the combs\r\nto mould, the honey becomes sour, and thin like water, rendering it\r\nunsuitable food for the bee, and bringing on diseases--dysentery,\r\nbee cholera, foul brood, etc., and in a short time the bees are all\r\ndestroyed. Thousands of good swarms are lost every winter by improper\r\nmanagement, and from being kept in hives not suitable for wintering. I\r\ngive directions for wintering on my plan, in Controllable Hives, and I\r\nfeel confident, if directions are carefully followed, that many stocks\r\nwill be saved annually, which otherwise would have perished.\r\n\r\n\r\n               How to Winter Bees in Controllable Hives.\r\n\r\nBees are wintered in Controllable Hives on their summer stands, by my\r\nplan, without loss, by maintaining an even temperature in the brood\r\nsection, and disposing of all moisture or perspiration thrown off\r\nby the bees in cold weather. I have never lost a swarm of bees in\r\nControllable Hives in the winter. I attempt to winter none, except\r\nstrong, healthy stocks. I have no mouldy combs, no sour honey. The\r\ncombs are kept perfectly dry, and the hives in a healthy condition. I\r\ndo not lose a teacupful of bees, on the average, from each of my hives\r\nduring the winter.\r\n\r\nTo winter in Controllable Hives, prepare as follows: At the\r\ncommencement of steady cold weather, which, in the New England States,\r\nis usually near the close of November, put the bees in condition to\r\nwinter by entirely closing the upper entrance to the hive, and the\r\nlower one shut up about one-half.[11] Take out the box frames at the\r\nsides of the brood section, and put the movable partitions in place.\r\nRemove the boxes and feeder, or honey board, (whichever is in place)\r\nfrom over the brood section. Place the ventilator (described elsewhere)\r\nover the brood section, so the lower edge of the ventilator, at the\r\nsides, will rest on the upper edges of the movable partitions, on\r\neach side of the brood section. Pack the sides of the hive (that part\r\noccupied by the side boxes in summer,) closely with very line hay or\r\nstraw. Pack the cap as full of the same matter as it can be crowded.\r\nThen put the thickness of one or two inches over the ventilator,\r\nfilling up evenly, so when the cap is placed ever the upper part, the\r\ncap and sides will be compactly filled. There must be no spaces left\r\nunfilled, the object being to secure an even temperature in the brood\r\nsection, and absorb all moisture thrown off by the bees; and to do this\r\nsuccessfully, the cap and sides must be closely packed throughout.\r\nWhen you have the cap and sides well packed, replace the cap, and the\r\nwork is done. Shade the front of the hives during the winter months.\r\nNo matter if the snow drifts over the hive so as to completely bury it\r\nfrom sight, let it remain;--your bees are safe.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: To secure a slight upward draught of air, to carry off\r\nthe moisture arising from the bees, make a hole a half-inch in diameter\r\nin front and rear of the cap, in the center, close to the top or roof\r\nboards. (And here let me say, the roof boards, or boards covering the\r\ncap, should project about an inch, as they can be more firmly nailed,\r\nand make better joints; for driving rains must not be allowed to\r\npenetrate to the inside of the hive.) The inside of each hole should be\r\ncovered with wire cloth, to keep out insects, etc.]\r\n\r\nA neighbor of mine had fifteen stocks in Controllable Hives completely\r\nburied in snow over six feet deep, and the crust formed over them\r\nso it would bear a horse. They remained under the snow from January\r\nuntil April, when they thawed out, and every stock was found to be in\r\nfirst-class order.\r\n\r\nWhen there is only a small quantity of snow about the hive, say only\r\nenough to cover the lower entrance, and there should come a very warm\r\nspell of weather, which would bring the bees out, be sure to clear\r\naway the snow so they need not be kept back by it. But it will take an\r\nexceedingly warm day in winter to rouse the bees from their dormant\r\nstate in the Controllable Hive, and bring them out for a turn in the\r\nopen air. If the air is warm enough to induce them to come out, it\r\nis always warm enough for them to fly briskly. In this respect there\r\nis a great contrast between my hive and others. With other hives, an\r\nhour's warm sun will bring out the bees in winter, when the air is\r\ncold, and the consequence is, they fall into the snow and perish by\r\nhundreds. In this way stocks are often reduced in numbers until all\r\nare lost. The dysentery generally attacks such stocks (brought on by\r\nthe sudden changes in temperature in the hive.) and hastens their\r\ndestruction, by causing them to leave the hive, when they would not\r\ndo so if in a healthy condition. Bees, when wintered in Controllable\r\nHives as directed, will come out in the spring, strong in numbers, and\r\nin a healthy condition--in great contrast to the weak and diseased\r\nstocks which have been wintered in the ordinary manner. I have perfect\r\nconfidence in the method of wintering here recommended, for I have\r\nhad it in practical use for many years, and have never lost a stock,\r\nnotwithstanding some winters have been very destructive to bees in\r\nthis section, some, who practice the old methods, losing their entire\r\nstocks. I learn from my correspondents in all parts of the United\r\nStates that there is great loss of bees in winter; so great in fact as\r\nto discourage many from attempting to engage in apiculture.\r\n\r\nMy plan of wintering is very simple, and commends itself to every\r\nintelligent person. In a few words it may be expressed thus: The\r\nbrood section is secured against the effects of sudden changes in the\r\nweather, (this keeps the bees dormant throughout the winter season,\r\nwhich is as nature designed,) and provides for the absorption of all\r\nmoisture and perspiration arising from the bees, white in a dormant\r\nslate. These two points are the foundation of successful wintering.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n                          TRANSFERRING BEES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAS some of my readers may have bees in ordinary hives, which they would\r\nlike to transfer to the Controllable Hive, I will devote a chapter to\r\nTransferring.\r\n\r\nIf you have bees in a box or patent hive, or any of the thousand and\r\none bee hive humbugs, which are of little or no profit, and cause you\r\nmuch trouble and perplexity in swarming time, and frequent and heavy\r\nlosses in winter, you can move them into Controllable Hives--comb,\r\nhoney and bees together--and manage them on the plan here recommended,\r\nand they will winter well, come out strong and healthy in the spring,\r\nand cause comparatively no trouble in swarming time, yielding you a\r\ngood profit yearly.\r\n\r\nThe best time to transfer is as early in spring as the weather becomes\r\nwarm enough to keep the bees active every day, which, in the New\r\nEngland States, is usually in April. It is a good time to transfer\r\nabout twenty-four days after the first swarm issues from a stock, as at\r\nthat time there is but little brood, and usually but few bees. October\r\nis a very good time to transfer, but not as good as either of the times\r\nbefore mentioned. Great care is required to prevent robbing, and also\r\nto have the comb frames all filled with combs, and in good position for\r\nthe bees to winter. As cold weather is so close at hand, the bees will\r\nhave but little time to arrange for winter.\r\n\r\nIn transferring, construct the Controllable Hive as directed, with\r\nexception of the comb frames, from which leave off the triangular\r\npiece, as the comb can be better fitted to a flat surface. Make several\r\nholes one-fourth inch in diameter through the top, bottom and ends of\r\nframes, and a like number of sharp wooden pins about two inches long to\r\nfit these holes.\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning, before the bees begin to fly, prepare your\r\nsmoker, go to the hive you propose to transfer, and before you touch\r\nit, smoke the bees at the entrances moderately, giving them two or\r\nthree puffs, waiting about a minute and giving them two or three\r\nmore. Then stop the entrances, so no bees can escape. Take the hive\r\nfrom the stand and carry it to some out-building, so the bees from\r\nthe other hives will not trouble you, and get a taste of the honey,\r\nthereby inciting them to robbery. Turn the hive bottom up, and with\r\ntwo sticks, each about a half-inch in diameter and twelve inches\r\nlong, strike the hive lightly half a dozen times, and then wait for\r\ntwo or three minutes. Then with the sticks on each side of the hive\r\ndrum briskly (but lightly, so not to break the comb,) for about five\r\nminutes. Then puff smoke under the bottom board on all sides. Much\r\nof this preliminary work is for the purpose of confusing the bees,\r\nand inducing them to fill themselves with honey from the cells of the\r\nhive, as a bee gorged with honey will never volunteer an attack for\r\nthe purpose of stinging. The bees are now ready to be transferred. You\r\nwill need some one to assist you, and it will be necessary for you to\r\nput on your articles of protection, and keep your smoker in readiness\r\nfor use, as occasionally a swarm is bard to subdue, though the great\r\nmajority of them are perfectly docile after the treatment recommended.\r\nBut we are to \"beard the lion in his den,\" and to be forewarned is to\r\nbe forearmed.\r\n\r\nThe bees usually manifest their submission by a loud humming noise.\r\nIf after you commence operations (before you get the side of the hive\r\noff) they show a disposition to be cross, replace the bottom board,\r\nclose the entrances, if open, and give the insects a good smoking, at\r\nthe entrances, and by raising the bottom board enough to introduce\r\nthe smoke; give them the smoke freely for several minutes. Then again\r\nremove the bottom board. (These directions apply to the common box\r\nhive. If hives of a different pattern are operated upon, vary the\r\noperation to conform to the requirements of the case, applying the same\r\nprinciples.) Then with a chisel and hammer remove one side of the hive\r\n(the side to which the bees have attached the least comb,) and with a\r\nthin, sharp table-knife, cut the edges of the comb from the sides of\r\nthe hive. It is well to have a table or stand near by, with a cloth\r\nfolded in several thicknesses, on which to lay the sheets of comb with\r\nthe bees adhering, if necessary. The cloth prevents crushing. Cut out\r\na comb from the hive with the bees adhering, and cut off the edges, if\r\nrequired, so it will fit the new frame closely at the top and bottom.\r\nNo matter if it does not go the whole length of the frame from front\r\nto rear, as the bees will finish it.[12] Have the comb occupy the same\r\nposition, relatively, in the new hive, that it did in the old. When the\r\ncomb is in place in the frame, secure it by putting the wooden pins\r\nthrough the holes in the frames into the combs, and having fastened it\r\nfirmly in place by means of the pins, place it in the Controllable Hive\r\nin its proper position.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: But very few hives are large enough for their combs to\r\nfill the movable comb frames of the Controllable Hive.]\r\n\r\nTims proceed, till all the frames of the Controllable Hive are filled,\r\nor the comb in the old hive is exhausted. In transferring, very old,\r\nblack combs should be discarded even if you do not have your new hive\r\nmore than half full. Get all the bees, it possible, in the new hive,\r\nand when you set it on the stand, close the lower entrance entirely,\r\nand let the upper one remain only one-half open, for a few days, until\r\nthe bees get well located in their new home. Be careful not to crush\r\nany of the bees, and take special care not to injure the queen.\r\n\r\nAs you will probably complete the operation of transferring at about\r\nthe time that bees will be flying briskly about the other hives, it\r\nwill be better to put wire cloth over the entrances, to confine the\r\nbees you have transferred, and let them remain in the out-building\r\nuntil about an hour before sunset; then set them on the stand and give\r\nthem their liberty. Keeping them shut up for the time named, gives them\r\na chance to take up the honey which runs from the transferred combs,\r\nand which might, if the bees were carried immediately to the stand,\r\nincite robbing.\r\n\r\nTransferring is by no means so formidable an operation as at first\r\nappears. I have transferred a very large number of swarms from the old\r\nbox hives, without any protection for hands or face, and now the bees\r\nseldom show any disposition to sting. Yet I would advise beginners\r\nto protect themselves, until by practice they become familiar with\r\nthe work. \"Practice makes perfect\" is an old and true saying, and it\r\napplies to all operations with bees, I assure you. In my first attempts\r\nat this work I thought I must be protected, and I would not for the\r\nworld proceed without a protector, and that of the most invulnerable\r\nkind. Now, having had much practice, I feel no necessity for any\r\ncovering whatever. I trust I have made my method of transferring\r\nperfectly plain, so that every one who wishes may avail themselves of\r\nits advantages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n                             ITALIAN BEES.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE Italian Bee is a native of the Alps, and was first imported to this\r\ncountry about the year 1860. The Italian being a native of mountainous\r\nregions and a high latitude, they were reported to be extremely hardy\r\nand vigorous. Those who were first to obtain them, were unanimous in\r\ntheir praise of the Italian bee, and fully agreed that it was superior\r\nto our native or black bee in very many respects. The good reputation\r\nwhich preceded the introduction of the bee to this country, by time and\r\nexperience in their care, has been fully vindicated.\r\n\r\nThe pure Italian bees are superior to the natives in the following\r\ncharacteristics: They are more hardy and vigorous, withstanding our\r\nsevere winters, with ordinary care, better than the natives; they are\r\nmore industrious than the native bee, being very active in storing\r\nhoney in cool, windy, or cloudy weather, such as keeps the native bees\r\nquiet in the hives.\r\n\r\nThe pure Italian, being larger and more vigorous than the natives, go\r\ngreater distances to collect honey, and as they are larger, they carry\r\nmore at a time, and being swifter of flight than the natives, they go\r\nthe same distance in much quicker time. Then, too, the pure Italian bee\r\nis very beautiful, nearly the entire body being of a golden color, so\r\nthat some of its admirers have given it the name of \"golden bee.\" It is\r\nvery mild in disposition, seldom offering to sting unless unreasonably\r\nirritated. They show great activity in protecting their hives from the\r\nbee moth, even when weak in numbers. They also show the same trait in\r\ndefending their stores from the attacks of robber bees. When the native\r\nbees have come buzzing around a hive of Italians in search of plunder,\r\nI have seen an Italian dart from the hive like a bullet, and seizing a\r\nnative, while on the wing, bear him to earth and dispatch him with a\r\nsting. This feat I never saw a native bee accomplish. Being larger than\r\nthe natives they are able to reach the honey in the red clover, and\r\nmany other flowers not accessible to our common bees, which makes an\r\nessential difference in the amount of honey collected.\r\n\r\nRev. L. L. Langstroth says of the Italian bees: \"They gather more than\r\ntwice as much honey in the same localities, in the same time, as the\r\nswarms of native bees.\"\r\n\r\nI consider the pure Italian Bee a valuable and very desirable\r\nacquisition. I have furnished several of my lady friends with full\r\ncolonies of them in Controllable Hives, and they have expressed\r\nthemselves as very much pleased with their gentle disposition and great\r\nbeauty.\r\n\r\nI think the points of superiority here designated will be found in the\r\npure Italian bee. Very many, who have purchased bees purporting to be\r\nItalians, have been grossly deceived, having received simply a native\r\nswarm of bees, the queen of which, a pure native, had been impregnated\r\nby a drone having a slight tinge of Italian blood; such stock was but\r\nvery little, if any, better than a pure native swarm.\r\n\r\nI find I can make an improvement, even in the pure Italian stock, by\r\nselecting queens for rearing to supply my full stocks and with eggs\r\nand drones, from such stocks as show the superior characteristics in\r\nthe fullest degree. This course persevered in for a term of years will\r\nshow marked results in the improvement of the desirable points of\r\nsuperiority found in the Italian bee.\r\n\r\nI take great pride in my Italian bees. I believe they are as beautiful\r\nspecimens of this variety as it is possible to produce, and possessing\r\nthe characteristics of superiority of the Italians in the fullest\r\ndegree. The points which I strive to cultivate and develop fully,\r\nare: Industry, mildness of disposition, beauty of color, vigor of\r\nconstitution, etc.\r\n\r\nI have here given in brief my views of the Italian bee, as I receive\r\nmany letters of enquiry in regard to them. I base my statements on\r\npractical experience. I would advise all who wish to procure the\r\nItalian bees, to exercise great care in selecting them, and purchase\r\nonly of those who are known to have pure stocks, for the best is the\r\ncheapest in the end, no matter if the first cost seems high. If the\r\nworth of the money is in the bees, the higher the price paid, the\r\nbetter you will be satisfied. But do not pay even a low price for\r\ninferior stock, for you will not be satisfied.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Controllable Hive. Fig. I.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n                  CONSTRUCTION OF CONTROLLABLE HIVES.\r\n\r\n\r\nON the opposite page is given Figure I. of a perspective view of the\r\nControllable Bee Hive, with the measurements of its exterior parts.\r\nThe body of the hive is made in two parts, A and B. The lower edges of\r\nthe upper part B rest upon the cleats C, attached to the outside of\r\nthe lower part of A, near its upper edge--as will be seen by reference\r\nto Figures I. and II. The middle board D of the bottom is loose, and\r\nis held in place by hooks E. The middle board F, at the sides of the\r\nlower part A, are loose, hinged at their lower edges, and are held in\r\nplace when closed by the buttons G. In front of the lower part A, near\r\nboth its lower and upper edges, are formed slots, or bee passages, H.\r\nThe lower part A is divided longitudinally into three compartments by\r\ntwo movable partitions. The side compartments are designed to receive\r\nthe honey boxes J; and the center compartment forms the brood section.\r\nTo the inner surfaces of the front and rear walls of the brood section\r\nare attached boards, forming a double thickness, to secure a more even\r\ntemperature, keeping out the heat in summer and the cold in winter.\r\nThe grain of the inner board runs crosswise of the outer one to\r\nprevent warping. The upper edges of the inner boards are rebated out\r\nfive-eighths inch square inside, to receive the ends of the comb frames\r\nof the brood section.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Controllable Hive. Fig. II.]\r\n\r\nFigure II. is a perspective view of the Controllable Hive, with the\r\nupper part of the case removed, showing the position of the glass honey\r\nboxes at the top, with the feeder T in the rear, and also showing the\r\nposition of the side boxes J, in the large frame O. as shown more\r\nclearly in Figure III. The inner ends of the side boxes J, next to the\r\nbrood section, are formed of boards C, narrower than the boxes, leaving\r\nside spaces, to allow the bees to pass in and out freely from the brood\r\nsection to the side boxes. When top boxes and feeder are not on, a\r\nboard called a honey board is placed over the brood section, fitting\r\nvery closely, so as to confine the heat, generated by the bees, to the\r\nbrood section. In winter the brood section is covered by a ventilator\r\nmade as follows: Take a piece of fine board one-half inch thick. Get\r\nout two pieces, each one inch wide and twenty-two and three-eighths\r\ninches long, and two pieces of same width each ten inches long. Nail\r\nthe short pieces on to the ends of the long pieces, forming a frame\r\nnine inches wide by twenty-two and three-eighths inches long, inside\r\nmeasurement. Over this frame tack a piece of wire cloth twenty-three\r\nand three-eighths inches long, by ten inches wide, of a very fine mesh.\r\nThis frame will just fit over the brood section, and give a space\r\nbetween the wire cloth and the top of the comb frames of about one and\r\nthree-eighths inches. Tack the wire cloth on closely, so no bees can\r\nescape when the ventilator is in place. This ventilator is to be used\r\nonly in winter, as directed under the chapter on Wintering.\r\n\r\nFigure III., on next page, is a perspective view of a set of side\r\nsurplus honey boxes and their inclosing frame, with measurements of the\r\ndifferent parts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Side Surplus Honey Boxes. Fig. III.]\r\n\r\nThe brood section of the hive is twenty and one-half inches long, nine\r\ninches wide and twelve inches deep, inside measurement. The brood\r\nsection contains six movable comb frames, resting on rebatings, and\r\nheld at the proper distance apart at the bottom by a brace. The only\r\nplate where these frames touch the hive, is where the top bar of the\r\ncomb frames rests on the rebating at the ends. To the top bar of each\r\ncomb frame (on the under side) is nailed a triangular comb guide to aid\r\nin securing straight combs. Each side of the triangle is one inch wide.\r\nA piece of board one inch wide and three-eighths inch thick is laid on\r\ntop of the comb frames lengthwise in the centre on this piece. The ends\r\nof the top boxes rest in the center where they come together. Notches\r\nare cut on the underside, crosswise, to admit of the passage of the\r\nbees.[13]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: I have exercised great care, and incurred considerable\r\nexpense, in giving drawings with measurements and directions for\r\nconstructing Controllable Hives, glass boxes, etc., that such of my\r\nreaders as wish may be able to construct the hives and manage bees\r\naccording to the new system as taught in this work. I have no time or\r\ndesire to establish a business in the manufacture of hives, but if any\r\nof my readers want a full sized Controllable Hive, ready for a swarm\r\nof bees, the better to enable them to make the Controllable Hive, I\r\nwill furnish them. Price eight dollars. In no case will I furnish more\r\nthan one to the same address. The hive is not patent, so any one can\r\nmanufacture and use as many as they wish. They can make them at their\r\nhome, especially in the winter season, much cheaper than I can furnish\r\nthem.]\r\n\r\nIn the construction of hives use the best dry pine lumber, free from\r\nHaws or cracks, and put on a good coat of paint to protect from the\r\nweather. As the hives are to remain in the open air the year round, the\r\nbest of lumber is required, and that to be well protected with a heavy\r\ncoat of the most durable paint. Make close-fitting joints and nail\r\nthoroughly.\r\n\r\nThese hives, if properly constructed of sound lumber, will last many\r\nyears. I have had the same hive on one stand incessantly for six years,\r\nand at the end of that time it is as good, to all appearances, as when\r\nfirst put there.\r\n\r\nAll who desire to construct Controllable Hives, and adopt the plan of\r\nbee management recommended in this book, can do so freely, as there is\r\nno patent on the hive, or any of its parts or fixtures.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n                            MONTHLY DUTIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE successful management and care of bees requires forethought and\r\npreparation for all labor and care bestowed upon them, if we desire to\r\nbestow it at the proper time, and in the most judicious manner. I have\r\nin this chapter given only brief hints as to the work to be performed.\r\nSuch of my readers as are located in a climate essentially differing\r\nfrom that of the New England States, will perceive the necessity of\r\nvarying their management to correspond with the difference in climate,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nI shall repeat some of the statements already made, in order to impress\r\nthem more thoroughly upon the bee keeper. The object of this chapter\r\nis to bring to the mind of the bee keeper the more important duties\r\nrequired in the successful use of the system recommended in this work.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               JANUARY.\r\n\r\nWe will commence with January as it is the first month in the year.\r\n\r\nIn this month construct hives, glass honey boxes, etc. Give the new\r\nhives a good coat of paint. They will last longer, and as they are to\r\nremain out of doors the year around, it is very essential that they be\r\npreserved against the weather. A good, heavy coat of paint, spread over\r\ngood lumber, will prevent cracking and warping. Employ the time, in\r\nthis month of comparative leisure, in getting everything in readiness\r\nfor the approaching honey season.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               FEBRUARY.\r\n\r\nFebruary like January is not a busy month with bees in the Northern\r\nStates, neither do they require much care. If not finished last month,\r\ncontinue the work of January by making hives, glass honey boxes, and\r\nall fixtures required in the management of the bees in the coming\r\nseason. In some sections bees will fly briskly the last of the month.\r\nClear away the snow from the foot of the hives at that time. Set out\r\nmeal feed for the bees, provided they fly briskly.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                MARCH.\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of this month, clear the snow away from the front\r\nof hives; raise the hives up on blocks at the corners, remove the\r\nbottom board under the brood section, and brush out all accumulations,\r\nwhich might invite the bee moth to deposit her eggs, if suffered to\r\nremain through the summer. This accomplished, set the hive back in its\r\nplace. The first day that the bees fly, set out the meal as heretofore\r\ndirected. Commence to feed liquid feed as early as the bees will take\r\nit. Feed regularly every day, or every other day, at evening. When you\r\ncommence to feed, remove the packing from the cap, and also take off\r\nthe ventilator. The space over the comb frames not covered with the\r\nfeeder, cover with a small honey board. Let the packing remain at the\r\nsides until you have put on the side boxes, or until some time in May,\r\nas it keeps the brood chamber warm, which is essential in forwarding\r\nbreeding. Open a small portion of the upper entrance (about one-third)\r\nand keep the passage open at the bottom, the same as during the winter.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                APRIL.\r\n\r\nEarly in April--the first warm, sunny day--examine your stocks, and\r\nsee if they have fertile, laying queens. If the queen is all right,\r\nthere will be eggs and brood in the brood cells. Don't keep the hives\r\nopen any longer than is necessary, as the cold air might chill the\r\nbrood. At this time, if some stocks have a large amount of honey in\r\nthe combs of the brood section, exchange such with some stock that\r\nhas but little; as it is a disadvantage to have too-much sealed honey\r\nin the brood combs in the spring. It sometimes happens that all the\r\nbrood combs will be filled with sealed honey nearly down to the bottom,\r\nleaving but a very small place en two or three combs near the bottom\r\nfor breeding purposes. In such cases, take out two or three combs, and\r\nexchange with other stocks having empty combs, leaving in each such as\r\nhave brood and eggs, in every stock. Don't take out any bees. In this\r\nmanner equalize your stocks, and all will be benefited. If any stocks\r\nare found queenless, or with diseased or worthless queens, take means\r\nto furnish them with a fertile, laying queen, as soon as possible. In\r\nthe meantime, keep the entrances to such hives contracted very small,\r\nso but very few bees can pass at one time, to prevent attacks from\r\nrobbers. Queenless stocks, or those which have diseased or drone-laying\r\nqueens, will not resist an attack from robber bees with as much vigor\r\nas a stock having a fertile and prolific queen.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 MAY.\r\n\r\nIf surplus honey is your object the coming season, early in this month\r\nput on the boxes at the sides, and the last of the month, or as soon as\r\nthe bees commence work in the side boxes, remove the small honey board\r\nover the brood section, and put on the top boxes, except at the place\r\noccupied by the feeder. It may be well to feed liberally for about ten\r\ndays before fruit blossoms appear, in order to get the bees at work\r\nin the boxes. You can judge what is best. If the stocks are backward\r\nin breeding, the comb not filled with eggs and brood in nearly every\r\npart, it will be best to defer liberal feeding until a little later.\r\nYou should have had the brood combs filled with brood and eggs, before\r\nliberal feeding is begun, else the bees will fill with honey what\r\nshould be filled with eggs and brood; and thus the number of bees will\r\nbe reduced from what there would be if the queen deposited eggs in all\r\nthe cells. You want all the bees possible to gather the honey harvest\r\nof June, July, August and September.\r\n\r\nIf you want swarms, don't put on any boxes.\r\n\r\nAbout the time fruit blossoms appear, or a little before, open both\r\nentrances to their full extent, in all strong and healthy stocks.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 JUNE.\r\n\r\nThis is the month for swarms. It is also the month, in most localities,\r\nwhen the best quality of box honey is, collected. If you have arranged\r\nfor swarms to appear this month, have everything in readiness for\r\nthem. If you are arranging for surplus honey, remove the boxes as fast\r\nas filled, and replace with empty ones. Hive the swarms as soon as\r\nclustered. Be sure not to let them remain in the hot sun for any length\r\nof time. Have your hives all ready. This month is a good time to rear\r\nqueens in the miniature hives. Keep the grass and weeds about the hives\r\ncut down. They harbor the moth miller, when suffered to grow about the\r\nhives.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 JULY.\r\n\r\nContinue to take off boxes as fast as filled. Keep a sharp lookout\r\nthat the moth worms do not get in and injure the honey in the boxes\r\nwhich you have removed. If the supply of honey fails when the boxes are\r\nonly partially filled, feed the bees liberally, until the boxes are\r\nfinished. Do this as soon as honey fails, as the bees will store faster\r\nin boxes if fed as soon as the natural supply of honey ceases. It will\r\nbe well to put on a few boxes--say, one side to each new swarm which\r\nhas been hived early; and also on old stocks that swarmed early. Put\r\nthe boxes on one side first; then if the bees go to work in them, put\r\nin the other side.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                AUGUST.\r\n\r\nIf you have a market near home, the surplus honey in glass boxes will\r\nsell very well the last of this month, before honey is brought from\r\naway; but if you are to ship a great distance, the weather will be too\r\nwarm in this month. Keep a close watch that the boxes you have taken\r\noff do rot get wormy. Eternal vigilance is the price of success.\r\n\r\nKeep boxes on your hives through this month and next, for surplus\r\nhoney. Keep down the grass and weeds about the hives.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              SEPTEMBER.\r\n\r\nIn some localities September gives a very good yield of honey. I\r\nrecollect one season in particular, since I adopted my present system\r\nof bee management, when the yield of box honey in September was very\r\nremarkable. Some of my hives of bees filled their full set of boxes\r\nalmost entirely in a few days. I think that it was in considerably less\r\nthan two weeks, that they finished them up, and they had only a light\r\nstart--a few small pieces of comb in some of the boxes, and in the\r\nothers none at all.\r\n\r\nFeed at the last of this month, to complete all partially filled boxes,\r\nand at the very last of the month, or first of October, feed such\r\nswarms as may be deficient of stores for winter, if you prefer to do\r\nthis rather than to equalize by exchange of comb frames, as directed\r\nin another place. If you decide to thus equalize, do it the last of\r\nOctober or the first of November.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               OCTOBER.\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of this month, continue to feed such stocks, if\r\nany, as are short of honey, yet are supplied with a good amount of comb\r\nin which to store honey. As the yield of honey from flowers closes\r\nthis month, at its end remove all boxes from the hives. Such as are\r\npartially filled with comb or honey may be set in a cold, dry place,\r\nand remain for use another year. If placed where they will freeze, and\r\nthen sealed up carefully, so the moth miller cannot get in, they will\r\nbe in good condition when wanted next season. Boxes that have comb\r\nabout a third full or even less, are finished very quickly by the bees.\r\nBe sure to keep all such boxes for the next season. You probably have\r\na few queens in your miniature hives. Look over your stocks, and if\r\nany are found queenless, or with diseased queens, give them a new and\r\nprolific one.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               NOVEMBER.\r\n\r\nThe first of November, if not already done, exchange comb frames, from\r\nstocks deficient in stores to winter, with such as can spare a frame\r\nof honey. Do this until all have stores sufficient for winter. Twenty\r\npounds of honey will render them safe until you begin to feed in the\r\nspring. From the middle to the last of November is usually the time to\r\nprepare the hives for winter, by packing with hay or straw, as directed\r\nin another place. This should not be done until a few days before\r\nsteady cold weather sets in. Care should be exercised not to put it off\r\nuntil it is too cold; neither should it be done too early. Be sure to\r\npack thoroughly. Success in wintering depends in a great degree upon\r\nthorough work in packing the hives.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               DECEMBER.\r\n\r\nIn this month procure your lumber and all material for making hives,\r\nboxes, etc., to be worked up during the winter. If there are small\r\nvillages or large cities near by, you will find this month a good time\r\nto market your honey, if you have any on hand. With a little effort,\r\nyou can have ready customers for your goods, or at least a portion of\r\nit. Honey in glass boxes is in such nice shape, that any one who likes\r\na fine article, will pay a liberal price for it, after they have once\r\ntested its quality. In a few years you will have established a trade\r\nwith ready customers, near home, at remunerative prices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\n                              CONCLUSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nWE often hear this question asked: \"Are bees Profitable?\" and the\r\nreplies given are various, contradictory and amusing, varying in\r\naccordance with the honesty, experience, skill and success of the bee\r\nkeeper. Such as have attempted bee keeping with the old fashioned\r\nsquare box hives, under the old system of management based on fire and\r\nbrimstone, will say there is no profit in bees, and that you must not\r\nmolest them at all; if you do, \"they will run out, and you will loose\r\nyour luck.\"\r\n\r\nThere is another class, who have adopted all the extravagant fancies of\r\nthe patent bee hive venders, paying large sums of money for hives worse\r\nthan useless, with what are claimed to be patent fixtures--expecting\r\na sudden fortune as the result, and found the whole thing a fraud.\r\nPerhaps they have been duped in this way a half-dozen times or more,\r\nand always with the same result. This class will tell you emphatically,\r\nthat everything pertaining to bees is a humbug and a cheat--no money in\r\nthem, etc.\r\n\r\nIn presenting the statements made in this work, I am not blinded nor\r\ninfluenced by any selfish motive, in condemning or recommending any one\r\nsystem of bee management or hive. I only wish to present facts, and\r\ndo what little I can to make bee keeping safe and profitable to all\r\nwho engage in it. There is much written on the subject of bees--their\r\nhabits and management, construction of hives, etc., which is mere\r\nguess-work. A great deal is written, too, for no other than selfish\r\nor prejudiced motives. What is wanted is practical instruction on the\r\nsubject--such instruction and statements as are based on experience,\r\nand will stand the test of application, when brought into active,\r\nevery-day use.\r\n\r\nThe real, practical experience of the bee keeper, who has devoted\r\nmany years to the work, and will tell what has come under his or her\r\npersonal observation, is worth much more than the finest spun theory\r\nof the most learned and talented theorist; or in other words, mere\r\nconjecture is a poor and uncertain guide in bee keeping. It is an old\r\nbut true saying that \"Practice makes Perfect.\" In no business will this\r\nsaying apply more closely or with greater force than to bee keeping.\r\n\r\nThat bees are profitable when rightly managed, I think I have shown in\r\nthis little work; and that they can be of no profit, as often managed,\r\nI think is equally made clear.\r\n\r\nThe natural habits of bees have not been sufficiently understood, by\r\nthe majority of bee keepers. This has rendered them an easy prey to\r\nthe many speculators in bee hives of peculiar shape and construction,\r\nwho are constantly urging their claims to possessing great knowledge\r\nof bees, when perhaps they never saw a bee; and care not one straw\r\nfor the advancement of successful bee culture. I find, with the great\r\nmajority of hives now in use, there are many obstacles to successful\r\nand profitable bee keeping. There is too little room for storing box\r\nhoney in them. Boxes are often difficult of access to the bees, so that\r\nthey manifest much reluctance about entering them, often clustering\r\non the outside of the hive through the honey season, when they should\r\nbe at work in the boxes. Then, too, the boxes are usually too large,\r\nwhich renders the honey unsalable. Honey in large boxes often contains\r\ncells of brood, and bee bread, or pollen, interspersed among the honey\r\ncells, which are a great damage to it, rendering it very unsalable.\r\nGlass boxes, each holding about four and one-half pounds, is the proper\r\nsize. A swarm of bees in a hive with thirty of these boxes, judiciously\r\narranged, will fill them nearly as quickly as they would half the\r\nnumber, as the bees have ample room to work without crowding.\r\n\r\nThere are a vast number of bee keepers who now have bees which are of\r\nno profit to them, but instead are only a perplexity and trouble. If\r\nsuch would manage their bees on correct and scientific principles, in\r\naccordance with their natural habits and instincts, with judicious care\r\nand attention bestowed at the right time, and in the proper manner,\r\nusing a hive constructed in accordance with those principles, they\r\nwould be surprised at the results which would follow.\r\n\r\nTo succeed with bees, we should recollect that personal experience is\r\nthe best guide; and next to this is the instruction of those engaged in\r\nthe business, who prove by the results which follow their management,\r\nthat they make bee culture profitable. In commencing bee keeping, if\r\nyou purchase bees, use great care in doing so. Buy none but strong,\r\nhealthy stocks. If you purchase in box hives or patent hives, you will\r\nbe very likely, if not acquainted with bees, or unless purchasing of\r\nsome reliable person, to get diseased stocks; and again, a person who\r\nkeeps bees by the ordinary methods, is very likely to have diseased\r\nstocks which he thinks are all right. So, great care is necessary in\r\nbuying your outfit to commence bee keeping. Diseased stocks are dear at\r\nany price. You want the very best to start with, if you can possibly\r\nget them. Be sure to get such stocks as have young queens, for if the\r\nstock has a queen four years old or more, (and they are likely to be\r\nthat old in box or patent hives, under ordinary management,) such a\r\nqueen is liable to fail at any time, and loss of the stock follows.\r\n\r\nIn commencing to keep bees, if possible start with good, strong,\r\nhealthy stocks, in the right kind of a hive; then you will have no\r\ndifficulty in changing them. But if this cannot possibly be done,\r\nbe sure to start with strong, healthy stocks. If you must take\r\nsecond-class hives, of this class the plain movable comb and box hives\r\nare best. But be sure to let the patent hives entirely alone; they are\r\na curse to the bee-keeper. If you get your bees in second-class hives,\r\ntransfer them to Controllable Hives, or as fast as they swarm put them\r\nin Controllable Hives. In this way you will soon have your bees in\r\nshape to pay you a good profit.\r\n\r\nWhen you begin keeping bees, study closely their natural habits and\r\nrequirements. Give them such care and attention as your judgement and\r\npresent knowledge teaches they require. Persevere, and ultimate success\r\nis certain.\r\n\r\nEvery one who attains success with bees, will find that there is\r\nsomething more to be done, than simply to stand with folded hands,\r\nwith the expectation that a fortune must inevitably follow. Know the\r\nprecise condition of your bees at all times--whether they are weak or\r\nstrong, whether they are without a queen, or whether the queen has\r\nbecome so old as to have passed her usefulness. After a period of\r\nyears, queens become barren, and unless they are removed, and a young\r\nqueen substituted, the bees will rapidly decline in numbers, and all\r\ndisappear from the hive in a few weeks or months.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be too strongly urged upon the beginner, this great necessity\r\nof securing strong, healthy stocks to begin with; and if possible, get\r\nthem in the Controllable Hives. All who do not fully understand the\r\nmanagement and nature of bees would save themselves much trouble and\r\nperplexity, by procuring, to begin with, one or more healthy colonics\r\nin the Controllable Hive. Your chances of success in the end, and your\r\nprofits of the first season, are greater from one swarm in this hive,\r\nthan from six in second-class hives. If you purchase bees in inferior\r\nhives, you will need to exercise great care that they are not diseased.\r\nThere is not one box or patent hive in fifty (as ordinarily managed)\r\nbut that is deceased. They are either badly infested with the bee moth,\r\nhave old, mouldy black combs, an old and diseased queen, or are in some\r\nway diseased. No matter how low the price paid for such stocks, they\r\nwill be found expensive. Be sure to get none but the best to commence\r\nwith; they are the cheapest in the end.\r\n\r\nI might illustrate this with many cases that have come under my\r\nobservation. One or two I will mention: A gentlemen in Connecticut\r\nordered of me a swarm of Italian bees in the Controllable Hive, in the\r\nspring of 1880, for which he paid me twenty dollars. He wrote me in\r\nJune that they were doing finely, and that he never saw bees work so\r\nwell--they were at work in all the boxes, some of them being nearly\r\nfilled with honey, and all the combs being filled with bees at work\r\nstoring; and from appearances he should get a large amount of surplus\r\nbox honey from them.\r\n\r\nAnother gentleman wrote me, almost the same time, asking my price for a\r\nswarm of Italian bees, and when informed that it was twenty dollars, he\r\nwrote me that as he could get the Italian bees nearer his home for ten\r\ndollars, he would not order of me, but would invest his twenty dollars\r\nand get two swarms instead of one. He has since written me that one of\r\nthe swarms for which he paid ten dollars he has lost outright, leaving\r\nhim only a mass of moth worms in old and mouldy black combs. The other\r\nhas proved to be queenless, and has caused him more trouble and\r\nperplexity than it is worth, to say the least. There is now not over a\r\npint of bees in the hive, but he has put in a queen and hopes to save\r\nthem from total loss.\r\n\r\nI know of another case where a gentleman bought six swarms of bees in\r\nbox hives. They were very heavy and he thought of course they were all\r\nright. He knew nothing of the diseases of bees, and supposed if they\r\nwere heavy, and had honey enough, that was all that was necessary.\r\nHe bought them in the fall at a very low price, and was much elated\r\nover his purchase. Five of the six swarms died during the winter, and\r\nthe remaining one came out in the spring so weak as to be no profit\r\nwhatever the next season; and the next winter that also died.\r\n\r\nIt is an established fact that to succeed well with bees they must be\r\nkept in hives suited to their habits and requirements, and with the\r\nview of rendering them profitable. Such is the Controllable Hive. And\r\nthey must be managed on principles in accordance with nature's laws,\r\nand the instincts and habits of the honey bee. Such is the new system\r\nrecommended in this book--Bee Keeping Reduced to a Science; no \"luck,\"\r\nno \"guess-work,\" no \"chance\" about it.\r\n\r\nTrusting that this little work may be the means of greatly increasing\r\nthe profits of bees, I bring it to a close.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber Note\r\n\r\nMinor typos have been corrected.
