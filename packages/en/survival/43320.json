It is uninhabited and very small, measuring\r\nabout five miles in length and less than three miles in width. Its\r\ntotal area is only thirteen square miles. This little piece of land\r\nmade itself famous by what took place on it during the month of\r\nAugust, 1883.\r\n\r\nKrakatoa is one of the many islands that form the large island chain\r\nknown as the Sunda Islands. The most important islands of this chain\r\nare Sumatra, Java, Sumbawa, Flores, and Ceram. Between Sumatra and\r\nJava, the largest two of these islands, there is a channel called the\r\nStraits of Sunda that connects the waters of the Indian Ocean with\r\nthose of the Pacific Ocean. The Straits of Sunda is an important piece\r\nof water that forms one of the great highways to the East. Shipping\r\nis, therefore, always to be found in its waters.\r\n\r\nAs can be seen by the map, Krakatoa is not far from the Equator,\r\nbeing situated in lat. 6° 7' S. and long. 105° 26' E. from Greenwich.\r\nSince there are about sixty-nine miles in every degree of latitude,\r\nKrakatoa is about 420 miles south of the Equator, and is about\r\ntwenty-five miles from Java. Java is part of the Dutch East Indies,\r\nwhich includes Java, Celebes, the Spice Islands, and parts of Borneo\r\nand Sumatra. Batavia, the principal seaport of Java, near the\r\nnorthwest coast, is a great shipping centre, visited by vessels from\r\nnearly all parts of the world. It has, however, no harbor, but is\r\napproached from the ocean by means of a canal two miles in length, the\r\nsides of which are provided with massive brick walls. Besides Batavia,\r\nwhich is situated about one hundred English miles east of Krakatoa,\r\nthere are many smaller towns or villages, the most important of which\r\nis Anjer, a thriving seaport town, where sailing vessels obtain their\r\nsupplies of food and fresh water. Before the eruption of Krakatoa,\r\nAnjer was provided with a strong, stone lighthouse.\r\n\r\nJava is especially noted for its production of coffee, in which it is\r\nsecond only to Brazil. Its area is about the same as that of the State\r\nof New York. Java is one of the most densely populated parts of the\r\nworld, containing nearly four times as many people as the whole State\r\nof New York.\r\n\r\nThese facts about the situation and surroundings of Krakatoa are\r\nnecessary to an understanding of the wonderful thing that happened on\r\nit during the month of August, 1883. In that month Krakatoa suffered a\r\nmost tremendous explosive volcanic eruption, for it is a volcano.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1. THE SUNDA ISLANDS]\r\n\r\nA volcano is a mountain or hill, generally conical in shape, having\r\nat the top a nearly central opening, called a _crater_, from which\r\nat times melted rock and lava, vapor and gases escape. The lava\r\neither flows down the side of the mountain in a liquid condition, or\r\nis thrown upwards into the air. If the distance the lava is thrown\r\nupwards is sufficiently great the melted matter solidifies before it\r\nfalls to the earth. In such cases the largest fragments form what are\r\ncalled _volcanic cinders_, the smaller pieces, _volcanic ashes_, and\r\nthe extremely small particles, _volcanic dust_. If, however, the lava\r\nis thrown to a comparatively small height, it is still melted when it\r\nfalls, and is then known as _volcanic drops_ or _driblets_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2. KRAKATOA BEFORE THE ERUPTION]\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising that Krakatoa is a volcanic island, since it lies\r\nin one of the most active belts of volcanic islands in the world, and\r\nnear the coasts of the most active of these islands; i. e., Java.\r\nThis belt, as shown in the map, includes, besides the Sunda Island\r\nchain, parts of Gilolo, Celebes, Mindanao and the Philippine Islands.\r\nThese islands lie between Asia on the northwest and Australia on the\r\nsoutheast.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3. KRAKATOA AFTER THE ERUPTION]\r\n\r\nThere is no other part of the world with, perhaps, the single\r\nexception of Japan, where so many active volcanoes are crowded in\r\nso small a space. The island of Java, small as it is, has nearly\r\nfifty volcanoes, of which at least twenty-eight are active. They are\r\nsituated in a lofty range running from east to west, some of the\r\npeaks of which are more than 10,000 feet above the level of the sea.\r\nVolcanic eruptions are so frequent that the island is seldom free from\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAs will be seen from the map shown in Fig. 2, Krakatoa consists of\r\nthree groups of volcanic mountains, the southern group giving the name\r\nof Krakatoa to the island. Strictly speaking, this mountain was called\r\n_Rakata_, but as it is now generally known as Krakatoa, it would be\r\nunwise to attempt to call it by any other name. The central mountain\r\nor group of mountains is known as Danan, and consists largely of part\r\nof an old crater. The group of mountains which lies near the northern\r\nend of the island was known as Perboawatan. From the centre of this\r\nlatter group of mountains are several old lava streams consisting\r\nof a variety of lava resembling a dark-colored glass, known to\r\nmineralogists as _obsidian_, or _volcanic glass_.\r\n\r\nAlthough Krakatoa was always a volcano, yet between the years 1680 and\r\n1883, it was in the condition of a sleeping or extinct volcano. There\r\nhad been a severe explosive eruption in the year 1680, that caused\r\ngreat loss of life and property, but ever since that time all activity\r\nhad ceased and it seemed that the volcano would never again burst out.\r\nIn other words, it was generally regarded as a trustworthy, sedate,\r\nquiet, inoffensive and perfectly safe volcano, that had become extinct.\r\n\r\nThe long continued quiet of Krakatoa was broken on the 20th of May,\r\n1883, when the inhabitants of Batavia on the island of Java were\r\nterrified by noises like the firing of great guns, that were first\r\nheard between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning. These noises\r\nwere accompanied by the shaking of the ground and buildings. The\r\nsleeping volcano of Krakatoa was evidently growing restless, but no\r\ngreat damage was done and soon all was again quiet. The disturbances\r\nwere merely the forerunner of the terrible eruption soon to follow,\r\nand confidence was soon restored. But suddenly, on Sunday, August\r\n26th, 1883, almost without any further warnings, Krakatoa burst into\r\nterrible activity and began an explosive eruption that has never been\r\nequalled in severity in the memory of man.\r\n\r\nThat memorable Sunday of August 26th, 1883, came during a season of\r\nthe year known as the _dry monsoon_, a name given the season of the\r\nperiodical winds from the Indian Ocean. Batavia, and the surrounding\r\ncountry, greatly needed rain, for in this part of the world it seldom\r\nrains from April to October, although the air is very moist and damp.\r\nFor this reason the beginning of the wet season is always welcomed.\r\nWhen, therefore, the rumbling sounds of the approaching catastrophe of\r\nKrakatoa were heard in Batavia, the people, believing that the noises\r\nwere due to peals of thunder, rejoiced, for all thought they heralded\r\nan earlier setting in of the wet monsoon. But when the rumbling\r\nsounds increased and reports were heard like heavy artillery, it was\r\nclear that the sounds were the beginning of a volcanic eruption, a\r\nphenomenon with which they were only too well acquainted, but, as\r\nvolcanic eruptions were far from being uncommon in Java, no one was\r\nvery greatly frightened.\r\n\r\nBut this time the noises increased to such an extent that the people\r\nbecame alarmed. Throughout the night the appalling sounds continued\r\nand were accompanied by shakings of the earth sufficiently strong to\r\nshake the houses violently. Sleep was out of the question. Many of\r\nthe people left their houses and remained all night in the open air,\r\nfearing the shocks would bring the houses down over their heads.\r\n\r\nThe morning instead of heralding the dawn of a beautiful tropical day,\r\nwith its bright, cheerful sunlight, brought with it skies covered\r\nwith gray clouds that completely hid the sun. The rumbling sounds,\r\nhowever, had decreased, and the people were beginning to congratulate\r\nthemselves that the dangers were over, when suddenly, the sky grew\r\ndarker, and there began a shower of ashes that soon covered the\r\nstreets and houses of the city. About seven o'clock on the morning of\r\nAugust 27th, a most tremendous crash was heard. The sky rapidly became\r\nso dark that it was soon necessary to light the lamps in the houses\r\nof Batavia, and some of the neighboring towns in the western part of\r\nJava. In addition to this the air was filled with vapor, while every\r\nnow and then earthquake shocks were again felt. These shocks were\r\naccompanied by terrific noises like those produced by the explosion of\r\nheavy artillery. The noises rapidly increased in number and intensity\r\nuntil they produced a nearly continuous roar, the nature of which it\r\nis almost impossible to describe since it is probable that such sounds\r\nhad never been heard before by man. It is a curious fact, which, I\r\nbelieve, has never been satisfactorily explained, that in most cases\r\nthe people in the immediate neighborhood of the volcano, as, for\r\nexample, those on board vessels in the Straits of Sunda, did not hear\r\nthe terrific noises at all. Possibly they were too loud and simply\r\ngave a single inward impetus to the drum of the ear and then held it\r\nin position.\r\n\r\nProbably some of my readers may remember that witty description given\r\nby Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes of an alleged effort made by all the\r\npeople of the world to find out whether or not there is a man in the\r\nmoon. This wonderful plan was as follows:\r\n\r\nCareful calculations were made to ascertain when it would be the same\r\ntime over all the earth so that all the people of the earth could\r\nsimultaneously shout at the top of their voices. In this way it was\r\nhoped that the man in the moon, if there were such a person, would\r\nnotice the noise.\r\n\r\nThe story goes on to tell how when the time approached for the great\r\nexperiment, and all were ready to shout as loud as they could, that\r\neach person reasoning to himself or herself, that amid so great a\r\nnoise no one could notice whether his or her voice was omitted,\r\ndetermined to remain silent, so as to be able to hear the noise and\r\nthe better to observe what the man in the moon would do when the sound\r\nreached him. The result was that every person on the earth remained\r\nsilent and simply listened, so that the earth was never so quiet\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nHad Oliver Wendell Holmes, or any other person conceiving the witty\r\nidea, lived during the time of the great explosive eruption of\r\nKrakatoa, on that memorable August 27th, 1883, he might have taken\r\nthe opportunity of observing the man in the moon, had he not been\r\nfrightened by what was occurring, for certainly never before were\r\nsuch tremendous or terrifying sounds produced, for these sounds, as\r\nwe shall see shortly, were actually heard for distances of more than\r\n3,000 miles from the volcano.\r\n\r\nThere were two different kinds of waves produced in the air by the\r\ntremendous forces at work in the eruption of Krakatoa; namely,\r\natmospheric waves and sound waves.\r\n\r\nThe atmospheric waves showed their presence in the air by means of\r\nchanges produced in the atmospheric pressure. Now, while these\r\nchanges cannot readily be felt by man, yet their presence can be\r\neasily shown by the use of instruments called _barometers_.\r\n\r\nThere are in different parts of the world, buildings called\r\n_meteorological observatories_, that are provided, among other\r\ninstruments, with recording barometers. These instruments caught\r\nthe great atmospheric waves that were produced by the eruption of\r\nKrakatoa. In this manner, the astounding fact was learned that the\r\nwaves starting from the volcano travelled no less than seven times\r\naround the world. When we say astounding, it must not be understood\r\nthat the formation of such waves was at all contrary to the known laws\r\nof physics. On the contrary, provided the force of the eruption was\r\nsufficiently great, such waves must have been produced in the great\r\nærial ocean. The astonishing, or wonderful thing, was that the force\r\nsetting up these waves was so great that it caused them to move seven\r\ntimes around the globe.\r\n\r\nThe atmospheric waves were so powerful that it will be worth our while\r\nto describe them in detail. Starting from the volcano of Krakatoa,\r\nas a centre, these waves moved outwards in all directions, becoming\r\ngradually larger and larger until they reached a point halfway round\r\nthe globe, or 180° from Krakatoa. The waves did not, however, stop\r\nhere, but continued moving onward, now growing smaller and smaller\r\nuntil they reached a point in North America, immediately opposite\r\nKrakatoa. Such a point on a globe is called an _antipodal point_.[1]\r\nThe waves did not stop at this point, but again advanced moving toward\r\nKrakatoa, growing larger and larger until they again reached a point\r\nhalfway around the globe, or 180° from Krakatoa, when they again\r\ncontinued moving but now continually growing smaller and smaller,\r\nuntil they reached Krakatoa. Here they again began moving completely\r\naround the globe, and this was continued for as many as seven times.\r\nIt must not be supposed that the waves ceased on the seventh time\r\naround. On the contrary, they, probably, kept on moving for many\r\nadditional times, but they were then so feeble that even the sensitive\r\nrecording barometers were unable to detect their presence.\r\n\r\nThere was another kind of waves in the atmosphere that did not require\r\nbarometers for their detection. These were the sound waves, and can\r\nreadily be detected by the human ear.\r\n\r\nNow, in the case of the great eruption of Krakatoa, the intensity of\r\nthe sounds was so great that the sounds could be heard distinctly at\r\ndistances of several thousand miles from Krakatoa.\r\n\r\nThe sound waves so closely resembled the explosion of artillery that\r\nat Acheen, a port on the northern coast of Sumatra, 1,073 miles from\r\nKrakatoa, the authorities, believing that an attack was being made on\r\nthe port, placed all their troops under arms to repel the invaders.\r\nThe sounds were also distinctly heard at Bangkok, in Siam, a distance\r\nof 1,413 miles from the volcano. They were also heard at the Chagos\r\nIslands, a group of islands situated in the Indian Ocean about 2,267\r\nmiles from Krakatoa.\r\n\r\nTwo steamers at Singapore, 522 miles distant, were despatched to find\r\nthe vessel that was believed to be firing guns as distress signals.\r\n\r\nThe sounds were distinctly heard in parts of South Australia, 2,100\r\nmiles distant, and in Western Australia, at 1,700 miles distance.\r\n\r\nBut it will be unnecessary to give any further details of the great\r\ndistances at which these sounds were actually heard. It will suffice\r\nto say that they were heard as far off as about 3,000 miles.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to picture to one's self such great distances.\r\nAssuming the greatest distances to be in the neighborhood of 3,000\r\nmiles, it would be as if a sound produced, say, in Boston, New York,\r\nor Philadelphia, was so loud that it could be heard in Amsterdam,\r\nLondon, or Paris.\r\n\r\nSome idea of the intensity of these sounds can be had from the fact\r\nthat in Batavia, when, in accordance with usage, a gun was fired from\r\none of the forts at eight o'clock in the morning, two hours before the\r\ngreatest intensity of the sounds had been reached, the sound of the\r\ngun could scarcely be heard above the continuous roar.\r\n\r\nWhile, of course, the principal reason the sound waves were carried\r\nso far was the great force causing the eruption, yet these distances\r\nwere increased by the fact that the explosion occurred in a region\r\nalmost entirely surrounded by great bodies of water. The waves could,\r\ntherefore, be readily carried along the surface of the sea. Had there\r\nbeen a high mountain wall, like the Andes of South America, on one\r\nside of the volcano they would probably have been shut off in this\r\ndirection a short distance from where they were produced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nSOME EFFECTS OF THE ERUPTION OF KRAKATOA\r\n\r\n\r\nBesides the sound waves in the air, there were waves in the waters of\r\nthe ocean. Suddenly, without any warning, the people of Batavia were\r\nsurprised by a huge wave that, crossing the Straits of Sunda, entered\r\nthe ship canal before referred to as connecting the city with the\r\nocean, and, rising above the brick wall, poured over the surrounding\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nAlthough Batavia was 100 English miles from Krakatoa, yet after\r\ntravelling this distance the wave was sufficiently strong to enter\r\nthe city and flood its streets with water to a depth of several feet.\r\nFortunately, the loss of life was small in the city of Batavia, but\r\nvery great in the surrounding towns and villages.\r\n\r\nThe ocean waves varied in height at different times of the eruption.\r\nThe greatest were from fifty to eighty feet high. Just imagine the\r\neffect of a wave twice the height of an ordinary house. The waves\r\ncaused great damage to the shipping in the neighborhood. In one\r\ninstance, a vessel was carried one and a half miles inland and left on\r\ndry land thirty feet above the level of the sea.\r\n\r\nThe total loss of life by the waves has been estimated at 35,000\r\npeople; besides this, of course, there was a great amount of property\r\ndestroyed. The greatest loss was in the immediate neighborhood of\r\nKrakatoa. Gigantic waves swept over the lowlands lying near the\r\nshores of Sumatra and Java, where over areas several miles in width\r\nnearly everything was destroyed, the houses, trees, and people being\r\nswept away and the surface of the land greatly changed. The towns of\r\nKarang and Anjer, as well as numerous smaller villages, were almost\r\ncompletely destroyed.\r\n\r\nThe seaport town of Anjer, by far the most important of the above\r\ntowns, was almost completely swept away. The heavy stone lighthouse\r\nwas so completely obliterated that no traces of its heavy stone\r\nfoundations could afterwards be found. The Rev. Phillip Neale,\r\nformerly a British chaplain at Batavia, from whose account of the\r\neruption of Krakatoa some of the above facts have been taken, tells\r\nof the brave action of the keeper of the lighthouse at Anjer. Besides\r\nhis work as lighthouse keeper, to see that the light was constantly\r\nburning during the night, he was charged with telegraphing to Batavia\r\nthe names of all passing vessels. On the fateful morning of the great\r\ncatastrophe, observing that the sun did not rise, he kept the light of\r\nthe lighthouse burning, and, notwithstanding the danger to which he\r\nwas exposed, continued at his post in order to send word to Batavia of\r\nthe passing of an English steamer. While doing this the lighthouse was\r\nswept away and the brave man perished.\r\n\r\nThe following verbal account of the destruction of the port of Anjer\r\nwas given by a Dutch pilot stationed at Anjer. This description is\r\nquoted by the Rev. Mr. Neale from an article prepared by him for\r\npublication in \"The Leisure Hour.\"\r\n\r\n      \"I have lived in Anjer all my life, and little thought the\r\n      old town would have been destroyed in the way it has. I am\r\n      getting on in years, and quite expected to have laid my\r\n      bones in the little cemetery near the shore, but not even\r\n      that has escaped and some of the bodies have actually been\r\n      washed out of their graves and carried out to sea. The\r\n      whole town has been swept away, and I have lost everything\r\n      except my life. The wonder is that I escaped at all. I can\r\n      never be too thankful for such a miraculous escape as I had.\r\n\r\n      \"The eruption began on the Sunday afternoon. We did\r\n      not take much notice at first, until the reports grew\r\n      very loud. Then we noticed that Krakatoa was completely\r\n      enveloped in smoke. Afterwards came on the thick darkness,\r\n      so black and intense that I could not see my hand before\r\n      my eyes. It was about this time that a message came\r\n      from Batavia inquiring as to explosive shocks, and the\r\n      last telegram sent off from us was telling you about\r\n      the darkness and smoke. Towards night everything became\r\n      worse. The reports became deafening, the natives cowered\r\n      down panic-stricken, and a red, fiery glare was visible\r\n      in the sky above the burning mountain. Although Krakatoa\r\n      was twenty-five miles away, the concussion and vibration\r\n      from the constantly repeated shocks were most terrifying.\r\n      Many of the houses shook so much that we feared every\r\n      minute would bring them down. There was little sleep for\r\n      any of us that dreadful night. Before daybreak on Monday,\r\n      on going out of doors, I found the shower of ashes had\r\n      commenced, and this gradually increased in force until at\r\n      length large pieces of pumice stone kept falling around.\r\n      About six A. M. I was walking along the beach.\r\n      There was no sign of the sun, as usual, and the sky had a\r\n      dull, depressing look. Some of the darkness of the previous\r\n      day had cleared off, but it was not very light even then.\r\n      Looking out to sea I noticed a dark, black object through\r\n      the gloom, travelling towards the shore.\r\n\r\n      \"At first sight it seemed like a low range of hills rising\r\n      out of the water, but I knew there was nothing of the kind\r\n      in that part of the Sunda Strait. A second glance--and a\r\n      very hurried one it was--convinced me that it was a lofty\r\n      ridge of water many feet high, and worse still, that it\r\n      would soon break upon the coast near the town. There was\r\n      no time to give any warning, and so I turned and ran for\r\n      my life. My running days have long gone by, but you may\r\n      be sure that I did my best. In a few minutes I heard the\r\n      water with a loud roar break upon the shore. Everything\r\n      was engulfed. Another glance around showed the houses\r\n      being swept away and the trees thrown down on every side.\r\n      Breathless and exhausted I still pressed on. As I heard\r\n      the rushing waters behind me, I knew that it was a race\r\n      for life. Struggling on, a few yards more brought me to\r\n      some rising ground, and here the torrent of water overtook\r\n      me. I gave up all for lost, as I saw with dismay how high\r\n      the wave still was. I was soon taken off my feet and borne\r\n      inland by the force of the resistless mass. I remember\r\n      nothing more until a violent blow aroused me. Some hard,\r\n      firm substance seemed within my reach, and clutching it,\r\n      I found I had gained a place of safety. The waters swept\r\n      past, and I found myself clinging to a cocoanut palm-tree.\r\n      Most of the trees near the town were uprooted and thrown\r\n      down for miles, but this one fortunately had escaped and\r\n      myself with it.\r\n\r\n      \"The huge wave rolled on, gradually decreasing in height\r\n      and strength until the mountain slopes at the back of\r\n      Anjer were reached, and then, its fury spent, the water\r\n      gradually receded and flowed back into the sea. The sight\r\n      of those receding waters haunts me still. As I clung to\r\n      the palm-tree, wet and exhausted, there floated past the\r\n      dead bodies of many a friend and neighbor. Only a mere\r\n      handful of the population escaped. Houses and streets were\r\n      completely destroyed, and scarcely a trace remains of where\r\n      the once busy, thriving town originally stood. Unless you\r\n      go yourself to see the ruin you will never believe how\r\n      completely the place has been swept away. Dead bodies,\r\n      fallen trees, wrecked houses, an immense muddy morass and\r\n      great pools of water, are all that is left of the town\r\n      where my life has been spent. My home and all my belongings\r\n      of course perished--even the clothes I am wearing are\r\n      borrowed--but I am thankful enough to have escaped with my\r\n      life and to be none the worse for all that I have passed\r\n      through.\"\r\n\r\nAs is common in cases of earthquake waves a great depression in the\r\nlevel of the sea occurred at places great distances from Krakatoa. For\r\nexample, at the harbor of Ceylon, the water receded so far that for\r\nabout three minutes the boats were left high and dry, and then a huge\r\nwave carried them with it as it rushed over the land.\r\n\r\nPerhaps one of the best evidences of the immense power of ocean waves\r\nis to be seen in the massive blocks of white coral rock that were\r\nwashed up by the waves, on parts of the coast of Java for distances of\r\nfrom two to three miles from the ocean. Many of these blocks weighed\r\nfrom twenty to thirty tons. Indeed, some of them reached the weight of\r\nfrom forty to fifty tons.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that the island of Krakatoa and its neighboring smaller\r\nislands formed portions of a huge cone about eight miles in diameter,\r\nthat has been broken up at some very remote but unknown time by,\r\nperhaps, a greater catastrophe than that of August, 1883.\r\n\r\nIn the Straits of Sunda the water was raised fifty feet to eighty\r\nfeet above the ordinary level, and produced tremendous destruction\r\nespecially on the coasts of Java and Sumatra, sweeping away many\r\nvillages and drowning many thousands of people. The wave had a\r\nvelocity of progression of nearly 400 miles per hour, or eight times\r\nfaster than an ordinary express train.\r\n\r\nWhen it is said that the _velocity of progression of the wave_ was\r\nnearly 400 miles per hour, it is not meant that a body floating on\r\nthe ocean, such, for example, as a ship, would have been carried\r\nforward at this high velocity, but would merely rise and fall in a\r\nto-and-fro swing to about the height of the wave; that is, fifty to\r\neighty feet according to what may have been the height. As in the\r\ncase of the sound waves these motions of water covered or passed over\r\nnearly all the waters of the earth. The waves progressing toward the\r\nwest, crossed the Indian Ocean reaching to the coast of Hindostan, and\r\nMadagascar, and sweeping around the southern part of Africa, finally\r\nreached the coasts of France and England, as well as the eastern part\r\nof North and South America. Sweeping towards the east, they reached\r\nthe coasts of Australia, New Zealand, and crossing the vast Pacific\r\nOcean were felt at Alaska and the western coasts of North and South\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nBut besides the enormous waves caused by the eruption, there were\r\nmarked changes in the level of the land. Large portions of the coast\r\nof Sumatra and Java were almost annihilated, much of the original\r\nsurface near the coast being submerged, and places that were formerly\r\ndry land are now covered with water to a depth of from 600 to 900 feet.\r\n\r\nThe enormous amount of material thrown into the air by the forces\r\nof the eruption is especially characteristic of this phenomenon.\r\nSuch quantities of pumice stone and ashes fell from the clouds that,\r\nsinking in the water and collecting on the bed of the channel, they\r\nchanged the depth of the water, so as to render navigation dangerous.\r\nIndeed, the Sebesi Channel, lying on the north of the island of\r\nKrakatoa was completely blocked by a huge bank of volcanic material,\r\nportions of which projected above the water, forming two smaller\r\nislands. These, however, have since been washed away by the waves.\r\n\r\nWe will not attempt to give at present any explanations as to the\r\ncauses of this great volcanic eruption, since the different theories\r\nas to the cause of volcanoes will be better understood when other\r\nvolcanic eruptions have been described. It is sufficient here to say\r\nthat if a large quantity of water should have suddenly reached a\r\ngreat mass of molten rock, frightful explosive eruptions would have\r\noccurred, and if the island was resting on a submerged crater its\r\nsudden disappearance may be explained.\r\n\r\nAnother great wonder connected with the explosive eruption of Krakatoa\r\nwas the enormous heights to which the fine dust was thrown up into\r\nthe air. It has been asserted that during the most intense of these\r\neruptions the particles reached elevations of perhaps more than\r\ntwenty-five miles above the level of the sea. Carried by the winds,\r\nthe fine particles remained suspended in the air for many months,\r\nand gave rise to magnificent sunlight effects, such as early dawn,\r\nlengthened twilights, lurid skies, and gorgeous sunsets of a reddish\r\ntint. There were also caused curious haloes, as well as green and blue\r\nmoons.\r\n\r\nThe fine dust particles consisted of minute crystals of feldspar and\r\nother minerals, and when examined under the microscope presented the\r\nappearance shown in Fig. 4.\r\n\r\nThese mineral substances permitted a portion of the light to pass\r\nthrough them, thus producing wonderful optical effects in the\r\natmosphere either because they acted like minute prisms and so\r\nproduced rainbow colors, or because they turned the rays of light out\r\nof their course as to produce what is called interference by color\r\neffects of a nature similar to the colors seen in mother-of-pearl,\r\nrainbow coal, or in the wing cases of many beetles. The explanations\r\nof these phenomena are too difficult for a book of this character.\r\n\r\nAn explosive volcanic eruption is a very terrifying and wonderful\r\nphenomenon. Frightful roaring sounds are suddenly heard, the earth\r\nshakes for many miles around, when suddenly a vast quantity of molten\r\nrock, and sometimes huge stones, are thrown out of the crater high up\r\ninto the air. So great is the force that throws these materials out\r\nof the opening that heavy masses of rocks often are ejected very much\r\nfaster than the projectiles from the largest guns that are used in any\r\nof the navies of the world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4. VOLCANIC DUST AS IT APPEARS UNDER THE\r\nMICROSCOPE]\r\n\r\nAs the molten lava cools and falls in the form of prodigious clouds\r\nof ashes, cinders and dust, for many miles around the volcano, even\r\nthe light of the sun is obscured, and one cannot see the hand before\r\nthe face. Some of the materials in these clouds are so light that they\r\nremain suspended in the air for many hours, often indeed for many\r\ndays, and sometimes even for years. The heavier particles, however,\r\nsoon begin to fall, and before long the earth's surface both around\r\nthe volcano, and often at considerable distances from it, is covered\r\nwith a thick layer of ashes.\r\n\r\nThe sounds accompanying a volcanic eruption are often terrifying. Amid\r\nshakings and tremblings of the earth's crust, known as earthquakes,\r\nthere are occasionally heard noises like the explosion of huge guns.\r\nSometimes these sounds follow one another so rapidly that they produce\r\nan almost continuous roar. Through the roar of the explosion a\r\ncurious crackling noise can be heard, due to the fragments of stone\r\nhurled out of the crater striking against one another, especially as\r\nthe stones which are thrown out of the crater and have commenced to\r\nfall back again to the earth, are struck by others that are still\r\nrising.\r\n\r\nImmense quantities of ashes, stones, vapor and gases are thrown\r\nupwards for great distances into the air, while, at the same time, a\r\nlava stream pours over the lowest side of the crater. As the column\r\nof ashes and cinders reaches its greatest height in the air, it\r\nbegins to spread outward on all sides, rapidly growing like a huge\r\ndark mushroom. This soon shuts out the light of the sun, and from it\r\nshowers of red hot ashes and cinders fall to the earth.\r\n\r\nIt would be extremely dangerous to be on the side of the volcanic\r\nmountain during an explosive eruption; for, even should you escape\r\nfalling into an opening in the side of the mountain, you might be\r\nkilled by the huge stones that are constantly falling on all sides\r\naround the opening, or might be buried under the vast showers of red\r\nhot ashes that are poured down from the dense clouds overhanging the\r\nmountain, or suffocated by clouds of sulphur vapor that rush down its\r\nsides.\r\n\r\nWhen at a safe distance the sight is certainly magnificent. There is\r\nno light from the sun. All would be in pitch darkness but for the\r\nreddish glare thrown upwards by the red hot lava, by the glowing\r\nshowers of ashes that are being rained down on the sides of the\r\nmountain, or by terrific lightning flashes, due to the discharge of\r\nthe immense quantities of electricity produced by the forces of the\r\neruption.\r\n\r\nNaturally a great volcanic eruption can cause a considerable loss of\r\nlife and property. When a large lava stream begins to flow down the\r\nsides of the mountain, it cannot be stopped, and should it flow toward\r\na village or town it is likely to destroy the town completely. Besides\r\nthis, the vegetation of the country for many miles around is destroyed\r\nby the showers of red hot ashes that fall from the sky. The houses of\r\nneighboring cities are similarly ruined by the great conflagrations\r\nthus set up. Further destruction is also caused by large streams of\r\nmud that rush down the slopes of the mountain, or by huge waves set\r\nup in the ocean. If the volcano is situated, as most volcanoes are,\r\nnear the coast, the showers of ashes and falling stones may set fire\r\nto vessels in the neighborhood, or the progress of such vessels may be\r\nseriously retarded by layers of ashes or pumice stone that float on\r\nthe surface. Sometimes these layers are so thick as actually to bring\r\nships to a complete standstill.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that volcanoes are in a constant state of\r\neruption. On the contrary, nearly all volcanoes, after an eruption,\r\nbecome _quiet_ or _inactive_. The air soon clears by the ashes\r\nsettling, and the sunlight again appears. A crust forms over the\r\nsurface of the lava, which rapidly becomes hard enough to permit one\r\nto walk over it safely. The vegetation, which has been destroyed by\r\nthe hot ashes, again springs up, and, if the volcano happens to be\r\nsituated within the tropics, where there is an abundance of moisture,\r\nthe land soon again becomes covered by a luxuriant vegetation. Most of\r\nthe people, who have escaped sudden death during the eruption, return\r\nto the ruins of their houses; for it is a curious fact that no matter\r\nhow great has been a volcanic eruption, or how far-reaching the ruin,\r\nthe survivors, as a rule, do not appear to hesitate to return to their\r\nold neighborhood. In a few years the fields are re-cultivated, the\r\nvillages are rebuilt, and the people apparently forget they are living\r\nover a slumbering volcano, which may at any time again burst forth in\r\na dangerous eruption.\r\n\r\nA volcano that throws out molten rock, vapor and gases is known as an\r\n_active volcano_. An active volcano, however, is only correctly said\r\nto be in a state of eruption when the quantity of the molten rock,\r\nlava or vapor it throws out is greatly in excess of the ordinary\r\namount.\r\n\r\nSometimes the volcanic activity so greatly decreases that the molten\r\nrock or lava no longer rises in the crater, but, on the contrary,\r\nbegins to sink, so that the top of the lava in the crater is often\r\nat a considerable distance below its edges. The lava then begins to\r\nharden on the surface, and, if the time is sufficient, the hardened\r\npart extends for a considerable distance downward. In this way the\r\nopening connecting the crater with the molten lava below becomes\r\ngradually closed, the volcano being thus shut up, or corked, just as a\r\nbottle is tightly closed by means of a cork driven into the opening at\r\nits top so as to prevent the escape of the liquid it contains.\r\n\r\nIt may sound queer to say that a volcano has its crater so corked up\r\nas to prevent the escape of the lava, but the idea is nevertheless\r\ncorrect and helpful. To realize the size of these huge volcanic corks\r\none must remember that the craters of some volcanoes are several miles\r\nacross. A volcano thus choked or corked up is said to be _extinct_.\r\n\r\nWhen we speak of an extinct volcano we do not mean that the volcano\r\nwill never again become active. A volcano does not cease to erupt\r\nbecause there are no more molten materials in the earth to escape, but\r\nsimply because its cork or crust of hardened lava has been driven in\r\nso tightly that the chances of its ever being loosened again seem to\r\nbe very small. But small as the chances may seem we must not forget\r\nthat the volcano may at any time become active, or go into its old\r\nbusiness of throwing out materials through its crater. A volcano in\r\nan extinct condition is not unlike a steam boiler, the safety valve\r\nof which has been firmly fixed in place. If the steam continues to be\r\ngenerated in the boiler, it is only a matter of time when the boiler\r\nwill blow up, and the explosion will be all the greater because the\r\nsafety valve did not allow the steam to escape earlier.\r\n\r\nSometimes an intermediate class of volcanoes called _dormant_ is\r\nintroduced between active volcanoes on the one hand and extinct\r\nvolcanoes on the other. The name dormant volcano, or, as the word\r\nmeans, _sleeping volcano_, is objectionable, since it might lead one\r\nto think that an extinct volcano is not sleeping but dead, and this is\r\nwrong.\r\n\r\nSince the plug of hardened lava in the volcanic crater is generally at\r\na much lower level than the top of the crater, the crater will soon\r\nbecome filled to a greater or less depth with water, produced either\r\nby the rain, or by the melting of the snow that falls on the top of\r\nthe mountain. Crater lakes, often of very great depths, are common in\r\nextinct volcanoes.\r\n\r\nOf course, when an extinct volcano again becomes active, two things\r\nmust happen if the eruption is explosive. In the first place, the\r\nforce of the explosion must be sufficiently great to loosen the\r\nstopper or plug of hardened lava which stops it. In doing this the\r\nmass is broken into a number of fragments that are thrown forcibly\r\nupwards into the air. After rising often for great heights they soon\r\nfall again on the sides of the mountain.\r\n\r\nBut besides the breaking up of the stopper, the lake in the crater of\r\nthe volcano is thrown out along with the cinders or ashes, producing\r\nvery destructive flows of what are called aqueous lava or mud streams.\r\nThese streams flow down the sides of the mountain, carrying with them\r\nimmense quantities of both the ashes thrown out during the eruption,\r\nor those that have collected around the sides of the crater during\r\nprevious eruptions. Very frequently, these streams of aqueous lava\r\nproduce greater destruction than the molten lava.\r\n\r\nIf you have ever watched common ants at work clearing out or enlarging\r\ntheir underground homes, in a piece of smooth gravel walk in your\r\ngarden, you can form some idea why the mountain immediately around a\r\nvolcanic crater is conical in shape. If the colony of ants happens\r\nto be fairly large, you can see an almost unbroken stream of these\r\nindustrious little animals, each bearing in its mandibles a small\r\ngrain of sand or gravel brought up from some place below the surface.\r\n\r\nCarrying it a short distance from the opening, it throws it on the\r\nground, rapidly returning for another load. In this way there is\r\nheaped up around all sides of the opening a pile of sand or gravel,\r\nthe outward slopes of which gives the pile a conical form. You have,\r\nprobably, noticed that the steepness of the slopes depends on the size\r\nof the grains; for the larger these grains the sharper or steeper the\r\nslopes, the very fine grains producing flat mounds or cones.\r\n\r\nIt is the same with a volcanic cone. The materials that are thrown\r\nupwards into the air, falling again on the mountain, collect around\r\nthe crater on all sides, thus giving it the characteristic cone-like\r\nshape of the volcanic mountain. Where nothing occurs to disturb\r\nthe formation of the cone its height above the level of the sea\r\nwill gradually increase. Very frequently, however, during explosive\r\neruptions, a large part of this cone will be blown away by the\r\nforce of the eruption only to be again built up during some later\r\neruption. Indeed, in the case of volcanic islands, the force of a\r\ngreat volcanic eruption is sometimes so great that not only is a large\r\nvolcanic mountain blown entirely away, but a hole is left, where it\r\nhad been standing, that extends further downwards below the level\r\nof the sea than the top of the mountain extended previously above\r\nit. The above are some, but by no means all, the wonders attending\r\nvolcanic eruptions. We shall refer to others in subsequent chapters in\r\ndescribing particular eruptions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE VOLCANIC ISLAND OF HAWAII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe volcanic island of Hawaii, the largest of the Sandwich Island\r\nchain, is situated in the mid Pacific, south of the Tropic of\r\nCancer. As shown in Fig. 5, this island chain consists of Hawaii,\r\nMaui, Molokai, Oahu, Kauai, Nihau, and about eight large islands,\r\ntogether with numerous small islands, extending in a general northwest\r\ndirection from Hawaii to Nihau, a distance of about 400 miles. Like\r\nmost volcanic islands they lie in more or less straight lines,\r\nprobably along fissures, in this case in two nearly parallel lines.\r\nThe island of Nihau, however, is an exception, the direction of the\r\ngreatest length being almost straight across the two parallel lines.\r\n\r\nThe Sandwich Islands lie 2,000 miles from San Francisco in deep water,\r\nbetween 2,000 and 3,000 fathoms, or between 12,000 and 18,000 feet in\r\ndepth. This island chain consists of great volcanic mountains, that\r\nhad, at one time, fifteen active volcanoes of the first class. These\r\nare now all extinct but three, and all of these are on the island of\r\nHawaii.\r\n\r\nIn his report to the United States Geological Survey for 1882-83,\r\nDutton states that the summit of Mt. Haleakala on East Maui is 10,350\r\nfeet above the sea level. Oahu has peaks on its eastern side 2,900\r\nfeet high, and peaks on the western side 3,850 feet high. The summit\r\nof Kauai is probably 6,200 feet above the sea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5. THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS _From U. S.\r\nGeological Survey_]\r\n\r\nIt can be shown by deep-sea soundings that all these volcanic piles\r\nare the summits of a gigantic mountain mass that rises abruptly from\r\nthe bed of the Pacific. There are reasons for believing that this\r\nsubmarine chain continues for many hundreds of miles in the same\r\ndirection beyond Kauai.\r\n\r\nThe extinct volcano, Haleakala, on East Maui appears to have been in\r\neruption at a much later day than Mt. Kea, which is also an extinct\r\nvolcano. But the natives have no traditions of any eruptions.\r\n\r\nThe volcanoes on the other islands have been extinct for a very long\r\ntime judging from the extent of their erosion. Dutton is of the\r\nopinion that the western islands of the chain have been extinct for\r\nmuch longer times than the remaining islands.\r\n\r\nThe Sandwich Islands, also known as the Hawaiian Islands, are one of\r\nthe colonial possessions of the United States. The island of Hawaii is\r\nabout 2,000 miles from San Francisco. Honolulu, on the island of Oahu,\r\nthe principal seaport of the chain, has a pleasant climate, and is an\r\nimportant coaling station for warships, commercial vessels, whalers,\r\nand trading ships generally.\r\n\r\nThe principal product of the island is sugar cane.\r\n\r\nThe island of Hawaii, as shown in map, Fig. 6, consists of five\r\nvolcanic mountains and some small coral reefs. These mountains are:\r\nMt. Kea, on the north, 13,805 feet in height; Mt. Haulalai, in the\r\nwest central part of the island, 8,273 feet in height; Mt. Loa, in the\r\nsouth central part of the island, 13,675 feet in height; Mt. Kilauea,\r\ntwenty miles east of the crater of Loa, 4,040 feet high at the Volcano\r\nHouse, and 4,158 feet on the highest point on the west, and Kohala,\r\n5,505 feet in height, running through the northwestern part of the\r\nisland, and the Kohala mountains in the northwestern part.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6. HAWAII _From Dana's Manual of\r\nGeology_]\r\n\r\nOf these mountains, Mt. Loa and Kilauea are the only active volcanoes,\r\nand are in frequent eruption. Mt. Haulalai was in eruption during\r\n1804. Mt. Kea has not been active during historical times, while Mt.\r\nKohala has been inactive for so long a time that its slopes are deeply\r\ngullied wherever the rivers flow down them.\r\n\r\nAs you can see from the map, Hawaii is very large. It has a length of\r\nninety-three miles from north to south, and a breadth of eighty miles\r\nfrom east to west, its area is about 6,500 square miles. With the\r\nexception of small patches of coral reefs, Hawaii is formed entirely\r\nof lava, and is the largest pile of lava in the world with the single\r\nexception of Iceland.\r\n\r\nWhere the islands of the Hawaiian chain have coral reefs extending\r\noff their coasts, excellent harbors are found in the deep waters\r\nbetween the islands and the reefs. Hawaii, however, has no extended\r\nreefs of this character, and, consequently, no first-class harbors.\r\nHilo, on the eastern coast, is the best harbor, and is, therefore, the\r\nprincipal settlement.\r\n\r\nA very brief examination of the map of Hawaii will show you that there\r\nare no rivers on the island, except on the sides exposed to the wind,\r\nthat is, on the northern and northeastern slopes. Since the yearly\r\nrainfall on Hawaii is large, being in the neighborhood of a hundred\r\ninches, you will understand that considerable rain water falls on the\r\nisland. In those parts of the island where it does not run off the\r\nsurface it must drain downward through the loose piles of broken rocks\r\nor cinders. A rainfall of one hundred inches a year means that if all\r\nthe rain which falls on each square foot of surface was collected\r\nin a flat vessel one foot square with vertical sides it would fill\r\nthe vessel to the depth of one hundred inches, or over eight feet.\r\nThe drainage of the rainwater downwards through these parts of the\r\nisland, must, therefore, be large.\r\n\r\nAnother curious fact you can notice on the map, is that the lava\r\nstreams of the past fifty years from Mt. Loa indicated by heavy\r\ndotted lines, in no cases begin at the crater, but start at fairly\r\nconsiderable distances from it. Later on in this chapter we shall\r\nexplain the reason for this curious fact.\r\n\r\nSince practically the whole of Hawaii has been formed from the streams\r\nof lava that have flowed at one time or another, you can understand\r\nhow great these flows must have been. But to do this fully you must\r\nnot only take into consideration the portions of the island that\r\nlie above the ocean and reach into the air at its greatest height\r\nto 13,805 feet above its surface, you must also remember that this\r\nmountain rises from a deep ocean, so that if all the water were\r\nremoved, you would see Hawaii towering up above the former level\r\nof the sea to the height of about 31,000 feet, or higher than Mt.\r\nEverest, the highest point on the earth above the present sea level.\r\nThis would be, approximately, five and eight-tenths miles. You can\r\nunderstand, therefore, how great the flow of lava must have been.\r\n\r\nWe shall begin the description of Hawaii with the active volcano of\r\nMt. Loa, or, as it is sometimes called in Hawaii, \"The White Mountain.\"\r\n\r\nYou will remember that the eruption of Krakatoa was of the explosive\r\ntype. Practically no melted rock or lava escaped from the crater.\r\nIndeed, if it had escaped it would not have been seen; for, not only\r\nthe cone near the crater, but also much of the mountain itself was\r\nblown completely out of sight and covered by the waters of the ocean.\r\n\r\nThe eruptions of Mt. Loa are of an entirely different type. In Loa\r\nthere are no explosions, the eruptions being what are called the\r\nnon-explosive or quiet volcanic eruption type. It will be necessary to\r\nexplain some of the peculiarities of this kind of eruptions.\r\n\r\nThere is a great difference in the liquidity or the ease with which\r\ndifferent kinds of lava flow. Some lava is very thick or viscid,\r\nor is sticky like thick molasses or tar, and therefore flows very\r\nsluggishly. Other lava is thin or mobile, more closely resembling\r\nwater in the ease with which it flows. Now, in the case of a volcanic\r\nmountain of fairly considerable height, where the lava possesses\r\nmarked liquidity, the lava as it rises from great depths in the tube\r\nof the volcano seldom flows over the top or rim of the crater. This is\r\nnot because the force that brings the lava up is unable to carry it\r\na few thousand feet higher, so that it can run over the brim of the\r\ncrater, but because the walls of the volcanic mountains are unable to\r\nstand the great pressure which the mass of liquid lava exerts against\r\ntheir sides.\r\n\r\nIt can be shown that a column of liquid lava 500 feet high, will exert\r\na pressure on the walls of the crater of about 625 pounds to the\r\nsquare inch. Therefore, in very high volcanic mountains, long before\r\nthe lava can reach the edge of the crater and overflow, the pressure\r\nbecomes so great, that cracks or fissures are made in the sides of\r\nthe mountain, through which the lava is quietly discharged; when, of\r\ncourse, the level of the lava in the crater falls considerably. In\r\nvolcanoes of the explosive type, no matter what may be the condition\r\nof lava, should a large quantity of water suddenly find an entrance to\r\na large body of molten lava at some distance below the surface, the\r\nlava would be suddenly thrown explosively into the air, where being\r\nchilled, it would afterwards descend in showers of ashes, cinders, or\r\nvolcanic dust.\r\n\r\nIn some volcanic mountains such as Mt. Loa, the crater, instead\r\nof being situated at the top of a conical pass of ashes or other\r\nmaterial, consists of a pit-like depression, generally occupying a\r\nlevel tract or plain at the top of the mountain. This pit is known\r\nas a _caldera_, or _caldron_, or what you might, perhaps, call a\r\nhuge kettle or boiler. The pit has more or less vertical sides that\r\nextend downwards for unknown depths to the place from which the lava\r\ncomes. The vertical walls of the caldera are not, however, smooth, but\r\nexhibit numerous horizontal ledges, that mark places where portions of\r\nthe floor of the caldera were situated at different times.\r\n\r\nAt the bottom of the large pit or caldera on the summit of Mt. Loa\r\ncan be seen the level floor formed of hardened lava. This floor is\r\nsurrounded by vertical walls on which can be seen the broken edges of\r\nthe old lake bed.\r\n\r\nCaptain Dutton, in a paper on Hawaiian volcanoes, prepared for the\r\nUnited States Geological Survey, and published in its Fourth Annual\r\nReport for 1882-83, thus describes the appearance at the great crater\r\nas it was in 1882.\r\n\r\n      \"The summit of Mauna Loa (Mt. Loa), is a broad and large\r\n      platform about five miles in length and four miles in\r\n      width, within which is sunken the great caldera called\r\n      Mokuaweoweo. The distance from the point where we first\r\n      reach the summit to the brink of the pit is about a mile\r\n      and a half. The surface of the platform is much more rugged\r\n      than the slopes just ascended. It is riven with cracks, and\r\n      small faults,[2] and piles of shattered rock are seen on\r\n      every hand. Nowhere is there to be seen the semblance of\r\n      a cinder cone. Doubtless many eruptions have broken forth\r\n      from the various fissures on this summit, but only here\r\n      and there can insignificant traces of such catastrophes\r\n      be definitely distinguished. The absence of fragmental\r\n      ejecta (broken rock that are thrown out) is extraordinary.\r\n      The shattered blocks, slabs, and spalls (chips) which\r\n      everywhere cumber the surface appear to have resulted from\r\n      the spontaneous shivering and shattering of the lava sheets\r\n      by their own internal tensions as they cooled.\r\n\r\nFig. 7, taken from Dutton's report, gives the general shape of this\r\ngreat caldera. Dutton's description of the same is as follows:\r\n\r\n      \"The length of the main caldera is a little less than\r\n      three miles and its width about a mile and three-quarters.\r\n      Its floor, viewed from above, appears to be composed of a\r\n      series of flat surfaces occupying two distinct levels, the\r\n      higher upon the surface of the black ledge, the lower lying\r\n      within the ledge. Upon the western side is a small cinder\r\n      cone standing close upon the border of the black ledge.\r\n      It is the only one visible, either within the caldera or\r\n      upon the surrounding summit. Its height is about 125 or 130\r\n      feet. It was seen in operation, throwing up steam, clots of\r\n      lava, and lapilli (some of the larger pieces of fragmentary\r\n      lava) in the year 1878. The only other diversifications of\r\n      the floor are many cracks which traverse it, the larger of\r\n      which are distinctly visible from above. Some of them are\r\n      considerably faulted. There is no difficulty in recognizing\r\n      the fact that the whole floor has been produced by the\r\n      sinkage of the lava beds which once continued over the\r\n      entire extent of the depression, their undersides having\r\n      been melted off most probably by the fires beneath. The\r\n      lava beds in the immediate vicinity of the brink upon the\r\n      summit platform wear the aspect of some antiquity. They\r\n      have become brown and carious by weathering, and, although\r\n      no soil is generated, little drifts of gravel are seen\r\n      here and there mixed with pumice. Since the caldera was\r\n      formed there is no indication that the lavas have anywhere\r\n      overflowed its rim. And yet it is a very strange fact that\r\n      within a half mile, and again within a mile to a mile and\r\n      a half, lavas have been repeatedly erupted within the last\r\n      forty years from the summit platform, and have outflowed\r\n      at points situated from 700 to 900 feet above the level of\r\n      the lava lake within. Traces may also be seen, at varying\r\n      distances back of the rim, of very many eruptions in which\r\n      the rocks betoken great recency, although no dates can be\r\n      assigned to their occurrence.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7. PANORAMA OF MOKUAWEOWEO _From U. S.\r\nGeological Survey_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8. VIEW OF THE CRATER OF KILAUEA FROM THE\r\nVOLCANO HOUSE _From U. S. Geological Survey_]\r\n\r\nDuring his visit to this great pit, Captain Dutton succeeded in\r\nclimbing down the almost vertical walls on the side of the crater,\r\nand, reaching the surface of the hardened lake, walked over it. It\r\nmust have required no little courage to thus venture on the thin\r\nfloor of a lake which he knew was filled to great depths with red hot\r\nboiling lava, for he was walking over the surface of a slumbering\r\nvolcano, that might at almost any moment awaken, and opening, swallow\r\nhim and his companions. Through enormous cracks in the floor, he could\r\nfeel the heat from the molten mass, while, through the same openings\r\ncame suggestive whiffs of sulphur vapor.\r\n\r\nDuring the eruption of this mountain, on January 23d, 1859, the light\r\nfrom the glowing lava streams was bright enough to read fine print at\r\nHilo, a distance of thirty-five miles.\r\n\r\nDuring the eruption of 1852, a stream of white-hot lava was thrown up\r\ninto the air from one of the fissures to a height of from 300 to 400\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STONES AND LAVA THROWN UPWARDS--ERUPTION OF\r\nMOKUAWEOWEO, HAWAII, JULY 4-21, 1899 _From a Stereograph,\r\nCopyright, by Underwood & Underwood_]\r\n\r\nWhen an eruption takes place in Mt. Loa the column of lava slowly\r\nrises in the crater, threatening to overflow its lowest edges, but\r\nbefore this can take place the pressure becomes so great that some\r\nportion of the mountain below the crater is fractured and the lava\r\nquietly escapes.\r\n\r\nDuring some conditions of the mountain every fifteen or twenty minutes\r\na column of highly glowing lava is shot upwards like a fountain to\r\na height of 500 feet and over, falling back into the lake in fiery\r\nspray. Unusual heights of these streams are generally followed by an\r\neruption.\r\n\r\nThese curious jets of molten rock certainly cannot be due to the\r\npressure of higher columns of lava, since the crater itself is near\r\nthe top of a high plain. They are believed to be due to steam formed\r\nby the penetration of the rain water that falls on this part of the\r\nmountain.\r\n\r\nYou can now understand why the lava streams escaping from Mt. Loa as\r\nshown on the map, in Fig. 6, do not begin at the level of the crater;\r\nfor the discharge of the lava does not take place over the rim of\r\nthe crater, but through the cracks or fissures formed further down\r\nthe sides of the mountains. It must not be supposed, however, that\r\nthe fissures are limited to the sides of the mountain where they can\r\nbe seen. They probably occur in many places below the surface of the\r\nwater on some part of the bed of the ocean.\r\n\r\nThe crevices that are formed in this manner in the sides of the\r\nmountain vary greatly in size, some being so narrow that the lava\r\nscarcely flows through them at all but simply fills up the crevice,\r\nhardens on cooling, and mends the cracks in the mountains, in the way\r\nthat a crack is mended in a piece of china by the use of glue or in\r\na wall of masonry by mortar. Through the largest crevices or cracks,\r\nhowever, large lava streams may continue to flow often for several\r\nweeks, or even longer.\r\n\r\nSometimes, especially towards the close of the eruptive flow, the\r\nlava may escape disruptively, so that small cones are formed along\r\nthe lines of the fissures. Cones of this character are called lateral\r\ncones, and in the case of a volcanic island, where the lava flows out\r\nbelow the level of the water, the lateral cones sometimes project\r\nabove the water and form volcanic islands or dangerous shoals that\r\nimpede navigation.\r\n\r\nWhen the lava pours out of a crevice in the side of the mountain, a\r\nriver of molten rock rushes down the slopes, at first like a torrent,\r\nbut on reaching the more nearly level ground, it spreads out in great\r\nlava lakes or fields, the surface of which takes on the characteristic\r\nblack appearance of basalt, a certain kind of glass, for the lavas of\r\nMt. Loa are generally basaltic. After an eruption the hardened floor\r\nof lava in the caldera, being no longer supported by the liquid mass\r\nformerly below it, falls in, leaving a large cavity with only the\r\nedges of the old floor clinging to the sides of the pit.\r\n\r\nIt will be interesting to give a short account of some of the great\r\nlava streams that have been poured out at different times from Mt. Loa.\r\n\r\nIn the great eruption of August 11th, 1855, the lava escaped through\r\nfissures from two to thirty inches in width. Then, flowing in a\r\ncontinuous stream, it did not stop until it was within five miles of\r\nHilo.\r\n\r\nIn the eruption of January 23d, 1859, the lava stream flowed towards\r\nthe northwest on the east side of Haulalai, reaching the sea in eight\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nThe eruption of March 27th, 1868, was characterized by severe\r\nearthquake shocks, one of which, occurring on the second of April,\r\ndestroyed many houses and produced huge fissures in the earth. These\r\nshocks produced great earthquake waves that reached distant coasts.\r\n\r\nMt. Kilauea, lies at a lower level towards the east. This crater is\r\nsituated at 4,040 feet above the level of the sea, and is nearly 6,000\r\nfeet below the caldera on the top of Mt. Loa.\r\n\r\nFig. 8, taken from the United States Geological Survey, Fourth\r\nAnnual Report, for 1882-83, shows a view of Kilauea from the Volcano\r\nHouse. Dutton gives the following description of the appearance of\r\nHalemaumau, the pit crater or caldera of Kilauea.\r\n\r\n      \"In front of us and right beneath our feet, over the crest\r\n      of a nearly vertical wall, more than 700 feet below, is\r\n      outspread the broad floor of the far-famed Kilauea. It\r\n      is a pit about three and a half miles in length, and two\r\n      and a half miles in width, nearly elliptical in plan and\r\n      surrounded with cliffs, for the most part inaccessible to\r\n      human foot, and varying in altitude from a little more than\r\n      300 feet to a little more than 700 feet. The altitude of\r\n      the point on which we stand is about 4,200 feet above the\r\n      sea....\r\n\r\n      \"The object upon which the attention is instantly fixed\r\n      is a large chaotic pile of rocks, situated in the centre\r\n      of the amphitheatre, rising to a height which by an\r\n      eye estimate appears to be about 350 to 400 feet. From\r\n      innumerable places in its mass volumes of steam are poured\r\n      forth and borne away to the leeward by the trade wind. The\r\n      color of the pile is intensely black....\r\n\r\n      \"Around it spreads out the slightly undulated floor of the\r\n      amphitheatre, as black as midnight. To the left of the\r\n      steaming pile is an opening in the floor of the crater,\r\n      within which we behold the ruddy gleams of boiling lava.\r\n      From numerous points in the surrounding floor clouds of\r\n      steam issue forth and melt away in the steady flow of the\r\n      wind. The vapors issue most copiously from an area situated\r\n      to the right of the central pile, and in the southern\r\n      portion of the amphitheatre. Desolation and horror reign\r\n      supreme. The engirdling walls everywhere hedge it in. But\r\n      upon their summits, and upon the receiving platform beyond,\r\n      are all the wealth and luxuriance of tropical vegetation\r\n      heightening the contrast of the desolation below....\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9. CRATER OF KILAUEA _From Dana's Manual\r\nof Geology_]\r\n\r\nFig. 9 represents the pit-like crater of Kilauea as it appeared after\r\nthe eruption of 1886. Here, as will be seen, there are several lakes\r\nof lava, the largest of which is known as Halemaumau. The eruption of\r\n1886, like all the eruptions of Kilauea, consisted of the escape of\r\nthe lava from an opening on the side of the mountain below the crater,\r\nand a sinking in of the hardened floor of the crater. The figure also\r\nshows the position of the New Lake that lies east of Halemaumau. The\r\nextent and appearance of each of these lakes are constantly changing,\r\nboth as to height and area.\r\n\r\nDutton gives the following description of the appearance of the lake\r\nof lava, and some curious phenomena that occur on its surface. He is\r\ndescribing the general appearance of the pool of molten lava covered\r\nas it is with a hardened black crust:\r\n\r\n      \"The surface of the lake is covered over with a black\r\n      solidified crust showing a rim of fire all around its edge.\r\n      At numerous points at the edge of the crust jets of fire\r\n      are seen spouting upwards, throwing up a spray of glowing\r\n      lava drops, and emitting a dull, simmering sound. The heat\r\n      for the time being is not intense. Now and then a fountain\r\n      breaks out in the middle of the lake and boils freely for a\r\n      few minutes. It then becomes quiet, but only to renew the\r\n      operation at some other point. Gradually the spurting and\r\n      fretting at the edges augment. A belch of lava is thrown\r\n      up here and there to the height of five or six feet, and\r\n      falls back upon the crust. Presently, near the edge, a\r\n      cake of the crust cracks off, and one edge of it bending\r\n      downwards descends beneath the lava, and the whole cake\r\n      disappears, disclosing a naked surface of liquid fire.\r\n      Again it coats over and turns black. This operation is\r\n      repeated edgewise at some other part of the lake. Suddenly\r\n      a network of cracks shoots through the entire crust. Piece\r\n      after piece of it turns its edge downwards and sinks with\r\n      a grand commotion, leaving the whole pool a single expanse\r\n      of liquid lava. The lake surges feebly for awhile, but soon\r\n      comes to rest. The heat is now insupportable, and for a\r\n      time it is necessary to withdraw from the immediate brink.\"\r\n\r\nIt is very curious to think of cakes of hardened lava floating on the\r\nsurface of molten lava, but, of course, this is just as natural as\r\ncakes of ice floating on the surface of water; for a cake of hardened\r\nlava is, as you will understand, only a cake of frozen lava, and,\r\nbeing lighter than the molten lava, must, of course, float on its\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nThe disappearance of these cakes of frozen lava and their remelting is\r\nstill more curious, and can be explained as follows: The frozen or\r\nsolidified mass of black basalt is a trifle lighter than the lava on\r\nwhich it is floating only while its temperature is high, and therefore\r\nexpanded by heat. As soon as it cools, its density increases, and when\r\nit becomes a little greater than that of the liquid lava, it begins to\r\nsink and soon disappears.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10. SECTIONS OF KILAUEA AT DIFFERENT\r\nPERIODS _From Dana's Manual of Geology_]\r\n\r\nProfessor Dana, who has made a careful study of the phenomena of\r\nKilauea, shows in Fig. 10, a cross section of Kilauea at different\r\ntimes. Before the eruption of 1823, the depth of the crater was from\r\n800 to 1,000 feet. At the eruption the bottom 600 to 800 feet, making\r\nthe depth of Kilauea over this deeper central part about 1,500 feet.\r\nThe varying depths at different dates are clearly marked on the\r\ndrawing.\r\n\r\nThe eruptions of Kilauea generally occur as follows:\r\n\r\nFirst there is a slow rising of the lava in the crater. This rising\r\ncontinues until the pressure is so great that the mountain is ruptured\r\nat some lower place. Next a discharge of the lava and a sinking to a\r\nlevel in the conduit that will depend on the position of the crevice.\r\nThen a gradual falling in of the hardened floor of the lake, a portion\r\nof the horizontal walls remaining on the sides of the caldera.\r\n\r\nThe eruption of Kilauea, however, has not always been of the quiet\r\ntype. There was an eruption in the year 1789 that would appear to\r\nhave been of the explosive variety. The following account is given by\r\nDana as taken from a history of the Sandwich Islands by the Rev. I.\r\nDibble, published in 1843:\r\n\r\n\"The army of Keoua, a Hawaiian chief, being pursued by Kamehamoha,\r\nwere at the time near Kilauea. For two preceding nights there had\r\nbeen eruptions, with ejections of stones and cinders. The army of\r\nKeoua set out on their way in three different companies. The company\r\nin advance had not proceeded far before the ground began to shake and\r\nrock beneath their feet, and it became quite impossible to stand.\r\nSoon a dense cloud of darkness was seen to rise out of the crater,\r\nand, almost at the same instant, the thunder began to roar in the\r\nheavens and the lightning to flash. It continued to ascend and spread\r\naround until the whole region was enveloped, and the light of day\r\nwas entirely excluded. The darkness was the more terrific, being\r\nmade visible by an awful glare from streams of red and blue light,\r\nvariously combined through the action of the fires of the pit and the\r\nflashes of lightning above. Soon followed an immense volume of sand\r\nand cinders, which were thrown to a great height, and came down in a\r\ndestructive shower for many miles around. A few of the forward company\r\nwere burned to death by the sand, and all of them experienced a\r\nsuffocating sensation. The rear company, which was nearest the volcano\r\nat the time, suffered little injury, and after the earthquake and\r\nshower of sand had passed over, hastened on to greet their comrades\r\nahead on their escape from so imminent a peril. But what was their\r\nsurprise and consternation to find the centre company a collection\r\nof corpses! Some were lying down, and others were sitting upright,\r\nclasping with dying grasp their wives and children, and joining noses\r\n(the mode of expressing affection) as in the act of taking leave. So\r\nmuch like life they looked that at first they supposed them merely\r\nat rest, and it was not until they had come up to them and handled\r\nthem that they could detect their mistake.\" Mr. Dibble adds: \"A blast\r\nof sulphurous gas, a shower of heated embers, or a volume of heated\r\nsteam would sufficiently account for this sudden death. Some of the\r\nnarrators who saw the corpses, affirm that though in no place deeply\r\nburnt, yet they were thoroughly scorched.\" As you will see in Chapter\r\nXI, this sudden and awful death due to highly heated air and dust\r\nparticles, caused even a greater loss of life in the catastrophic\r\neruption of Pelée, in Martinique on May 8, 1902.\r\n\r\nBy reason of its situation at a lower level on the slopes of Mt. Loa,\r\nKilauea was at one time thought to be one of the craters lower down\r\non the slopes of Loa. This was the opinion of Professor Dana when he\r\nexamined the district in 1840. Since this time the region has been\r\nmore carefully studied, and Mt. Loa and Kilauea, are now generally\r\nregarded as separate and independent volcanoes, neither of which acts\r\nas a safety valve for the other.\r\n\r\nWe shall not attempt in this chapter to say anything concerning the\r\nsources or places from where these great supplies of lava have been\r\ndrawn. This will be left to some subsequent chapter, after we have\r\ndescribed still other volcanoes.\r\n\r\nThe outlines of mountains like Mt. Loa or Kilauea differ greatly from\r\nmountains like Vesuvius; their slopes, like the slopes of all other\r\nHawaii volcanoes, have an inclination which does not exceed 10°.\r\nThe lava streams, therefore, as they flow down the mountains, move\r\nmore slowly than they would were the slopes more precipitous, as in\r\nmountains like Vesuvius.\r\n\r\nThere have been many eruptions of Kilauea. That which occurred in the\r\nyear 1840, was of great magnitude (see map, Fig. 6), and began in a\r\nfissure southwest of the crater. The principal eruption, however,\r\nbroke out about twelve miles from the sea coast, and about twenty-five\r\nmiles east of Kilauea. Here an enormous mass of lava forming a stream\r\nnearly three miles wide reached the ocean at Nanawale.\r\n\r\nWhen an eruption takes place on Mt. Loa through a fissure at the\r\nheight of 10,000 to 13,000 feet the length of the lava streams is\r\nfrequently as great as twenty-five to thirty miles. Often the lava\r\nthough hardening at the surface will continue to flow underneath\r\nthrough huge tunnels, of which the top and sides are composed of\r\nsolidified parts of the same lava stream. After the flow has ceased\r\nlong hollow tunnels often remain. If the lower end of such a tunnel\r\ncontaining molten lava is momentarily closed, the pressure of the\r\nlava above may not only burst through the obstruction, but may even\r\nthrow the lava upwards in jets 300 to 700 feet high. Probably most of\r\nyou have seen illumined fountains where jets of water are beautifully\r\nlighted up by different colored electric lights placed below them.\r\nSuch fountains, however, can but poorly compare either in beauty or\r\ngrandeur with these wonderful lava fountains, common on the slopes of\r\nMt. Loa during an eruption.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE VOLCANIC ISLAND OF ICELAND\r\n\r\n\r\nThe island of Iceland consists of a number of volcanic mountains some\r\nof which are still active. As can be seen from the map, shown in\r\nFig. 11, Iceland lies in the North Atlantic Ocean, immediately below\r\nthe Arctic Circle, about 250 miles east of Greenland, and 600 miles\r\nwest of Norway. Its length from east to west is about 300 miles, and\r\nits breadth about 200 miles, its total area, including the adjacent\r\nislands, being more than 40,000 square miles.\r\n\r\nWere all the water removed from the North Atlantic Ocean, it would be\r\nseen that Iceland rests on the bed of the Atlantic, on a submarine\r\nplateau or highland; for, in this part of the ocean the water is only\r\nfrom 1,500 to 3,000 feet deep. This submarine plateau extends as far\r\nas Norway on the east, Greenland on the north, and the island of Jan\r\nMayen on the northeast. Immediately north of the plateau the ocean\r\nsuddenly drops to a depth of 12,000 to 15,000 feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11. ICELAND]\r\n\r\nToward the south the plateau extends with but few interruptions\r\nthrough the middle of the ocean to a shoal known as the _Dolphin\r\nShoal_, as far as lat. 25° N. This part of the ocean, which can only\r\nrelatively be called a shoal, is not generally deeper than 9,600 feet,\r\nalthough in some places the water is more than 12,000 feet deep. On\r\neach side of the Dolphin Shoal the water is much deeper, being in\r\nplaces 15,000 feet on the east, while on the west there are depths\r\nas great as from 17,000 to 21,000 feet.\r\n\r\nThis sunken plateau, possibly including the shallower plateau on the\r\nnorth, is believed by some to be the remains of the fabled continent\r\nof _Atlantis_, to which we shall refer in another part of this book.\r\n\r\nThe coast line of Iceland is unbroken on the southeast, but the\r\nremainder of the coast is deeply indented with bays or fiords in which\r\nare many excellent harbors.\r\n\r\nIceland is liable to frequent earthquake shocks and volcanic\r\neruptions. From careful records that have been preserved in the\r\nhistory of the island, we learn that since the beginning of the\r\ntwelfth century there have practically never been intervals longer\r\nthan forty years, and more generally not longer than twenty years,\r\nin which there has not been a great earthquake or a great volcanic\r\neruption. These volcanic eruptions are often very protracted. For\r\nexample, one eruption of the volcano Hecla continued for six years\r\nwithout ceasing. Sir Charles Lyell, the great English geologist,\r\nwrites as follows about Iceland:\r\n\r\n      \"Earthquakes have often shaken the whole island at once,\r\n      causing great changes in the interior, such as the sinking\r\n      down of hills, the rending of mountains, the desertion of\r\n      rivers by their channels, and the appearance of new lakes.\r\n      New islands have often been thrown up near the coast, some\r\n      of which still exist, while others have disappeared, either\r\n      by subsidences or the action of the waves.\r\n\r\n      \"In the interval between eruptions innumerable hot springs\r\n      afford vent to the subterranean heat, and solfataras\r\n      discharge copious streams of inflammable matter. The\r\n      volcanoes in different parts of the island are observed,\r\n      like those of the Phlegræan Fields, Italy, to be in\r\n      activity by turns, one vent often serving for a time as a\r\n      safety valve for the rest. Many cones are often thrown\r\n      up in one eruption and in this case they take a linear\r\n      direction, running generally from southeast to northwest.\"\r\n\r\nThe volcanic eruptions of Iceland belong for the greater part to the\r\nfissure type. During a volcanic eruption in Iceland the ground is\r\nsplit in fissures or cracks, generally parallel to each other, and\r\nvarying in width from a few inches to several yards. These fissures\r\nextend for great distances across the country. The lava quietly wells\r\nout along the fissures not unlike the way quiet spring waters flow\r\nfrom their reservoirs.\r\n\r\nAccording to Dr. Th. Thoroddsen, the Icelandic geologist, there are\r\ntwo systems of fissures extending through Iceland, from southwest to\r\nnortheast in the southern part of the island, and from north to south\r\nin the northern part. Where two lines of fissures cross each other the\r\npoints of intersection may be especially active.\r\n\r\nDr. Th. Thoroddsen arranges the volcanoes of Iceland under three\r\nheads, i. e., _cone-shaped volcanoes_; _lava cones_; and _chains of\r\ncraters_, the last being the commonest. Out of 107 volcanoes examined\r\nby him in Iceland, eight were of the Vesuvian type, or were built up\r\nof layers of lava and volcanic ashes; sixteen were of the lava-cone\r\ntype, similar to Mt. Loa, of the Hawaiian Islands, and the remaining\r\neighty-three were of the type of crater chains.\r\n\r\nThe volcano of Snaefell Jökul, 4,710 feet above the level of the\r\nocean, is built up of alternate layers of lava and hardened volcanic\r\nmud. It is not, however, a true cone-shaped mountain.\r\n\r\nThe largest volcano in Iceland, the Dyngjufköll, with its immense\r\ncrater of Askja, has an area of some twenty-five square miles. In its\r\nform it resembles Snaefell.\r\n\r\nVolcanoes of the lava-cone type have been built up entirely of lava\r\nand have a slight angle of inclination. These volcanoes range in size\r\nfrom small hillocks to the largest mountains on the island. Their\r\ncones generally stand on a base of wide circumference and frequently\r\nrise to great heights, the top being occupied by a caldera, or pit\r\ncrater like that on Mt. Loa or Kilauea.\r\n\r\nVolcanoes of the type of chain-craters follow the natural fissures in\r\nthe crust. These craters are generally low, seldom being more than 350\r\nfeet high.\r\n\r\nThere are also seen in Iceland caldron-shaped depressions that have\r\nbeen formed by explosive eruptions. One of the best instances of such\r\ncraters is Viti, on the side of Mt. Krafla. This crater was formed by\r\nthe sudden eruption of May 17th, 1724.\r\n\r\nThe lava sometimes quietly runs out of the entire length of the\r\nfissure without forming any cone. This was the case of a great fissure\r\nknown as the Eldgja Chasm. Here three lava streams covered an area of\r\n270 square miles.\r\n\r\nAs the lava comes out of the fissures, it generally produces long\r\nramparts of slags, and blocks of lava that are piled up on either side\r\nof the fissure. Sometimes a line of low cones is built up. These cones\r\nconsist of heaps of slag, cinders, and blocks of lava. Their craters\r\nare not rounded as in the case of volcanoes of the Vesuvian type, but\r\nare oblong, or have their greatest diameter extending in a direction\r\nof the fissure.\r\n\r\nIcelandic lava as it escapes from the fissures is peculiar in that\r\nit is very viscid or plastic and can be readily drawn out into long\r\nthreads that can be spun into ropes. When such lava runs down the\r\nsides of a steep slope, it often splits on cooling into separate\r\nblocks. Where it runs over flat, level ground, however, it spreads\r\nuniformly on all sides, producing vast level lava deserts that are as\r\nflat as the surface of a well built floor.\r\n\r\nThere are many rivers in the north and the west of Iceland. Now, as\r\nthe lava streams flow out of the fissures they enter the channels of\r\nthe rivers so that the streams of water must find new paths to the\r\nsea, and this operation may be repeated again and again. Often the\r\ntime between eruptions is long enough to give the rivers opportunity\r\nto cut deep channels or gorges in their new channels; but on the next\r\nescape of the lava these gorges and valleys are again filled with the\r\nmolten rock, and the rivers must begin their channel cutting all over.\r\n\r\nYou will note the frequent use of the word Jökul, as Snaefell Jökul,\r\nSkaptar Jökul, Orefa Jökul, etc. The name Jökul means a large mass of\r\nice, or a mountain that is continually covered with snow, for example,\r\nSnaefell Jökul, is a beautifully shaped, snow-covered mountain\r\nsituated on a point of land on the western coast of the island,\r\nextending out nearly fifty miles into the sea, between the Faxa Fiord\r\nand the Briela Fiord. It is a very conspicuous object, being visible\r\nto passing ships at considerable distances from the island. Orefa\r\nJökul is the highest mountain in Iceland. Skaptar Jökul is one of the\r\nactive volcanoes of Iceland.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that Iceland has been formed entirely by lava\r\nthrown up from the bottom of a submarine plateau, until it extended\r\nabove the surface of the waters. To make an island entirely of lava\r\nwith an area of 40,000 square miles, must, of course, have required\r\nmany cones or craters that continued to pour forth lava for periods of\r\ntime much longer than those during which man has lived on the earth.\r\n\r\nThe surface of Iceland is far from attractive. The interior is\r\npractically a vast lava desert, covered with snow-clad mountains or\r\nJökuls. There is no plant life except in marshy lands near the coasts,\r\nand even here scarcely enough grass is raised to feed the few cattle\r\nand horses owned by the inhabitants. There is no agriculture, owing\r\nto the very short summers, so that all grain is brought from Europe.\r\nEvery now and then the grass crop is destroyed by accumulation of\r\nPolar ice on the northern and western coasts. Such failures are always\r\nattended by great famines, when many of the people die.\r\n\r\nShould you ever visit Iceland you would probably be surprised to hear\r\nthe people speaking about their forests. You might go over all the\r\ncoasts of the island without seeing anything larger than a birch bush,\r\nnot much higher than six feet. These are what the Icelanders like to\r\nspeak of as their forest trees, and I suppose there is no harm done,\r\nif one only understands just what they mean by \"trees.\"\r\n\r\nWhile, however, Iceland has practically no trees, yet it has no\r\ndifficulty in obtaining a plentiful supply of timber, since in the\r\ndeep fiords or bays on the western and southern coasts there can\r\nalways be found much drift timber brought there by the ocean currents\r\nfrom the forests of America.\r\n\r\nThe principal town or settlement in Iceland is Reykjavik, the capital\r\nof the island, on the southwestern coast; this is the chief trading\r\nplace on the island. Thingvalla is also an important town.\r\n\r\nThe lavas that form the entire mass of Iceland were thrown out both\r\nbefore and since the glacial age. It is the opinion of Geikie that\r\nthese outflows have continued uninterruptedly since that age to the\r\npresent time. It is known that the lavas of Iceland were thrown out\r\nboth before and after the glacial age, because during the glacial age,\r\ndeep cuttings or groovings were made on the surface of the earth by\r\nthe glaciers as they slowly moved over it. Now lava beds containing\r\nthe glacial scratches have been found and resting on them are other\r\nlava streams. The scratched lavas must, therefore, have been thrown\r\nout before the glacial age, and the second lavas after that age.\r\n\r\nLet us now examine some of the more active volcanoes of Iceland and\r\ntheir eruptions. We will begin with the well-known volcano of Skaptar\r\nJökul.\r\n\r\nThe following description of this volcano has been taken from a book\r\non Iceland by E. Henderson, published in Boston, 1831. Skaptar Jökul\r\nlies in the south central part of Iceland about forty odd miles from\r\nthe coast. It takes its name from the Skaptar River, down whose\r\nchannel the lava flowed its entire distance of forty miles from the\r\nocean. Skaptar Jökul consists of about twenty conical hills lying\r\nalong one of the fissures that extends from northeast to southwest.\r\n\r\nIt appears from Henderson's account that people living in the\r\nneighborhood of Skaptar Jökul were greatly alarmed by repeated\r\nearthquakes that were felt at different times from the first to the\r\neighth of June, 1783. These earthquake shocks increased in number and\r\nviolence, so that the people left their homes and awaited in terror\r\nthe coming catastrophe. On the morning of the eighth a prodigious\r\ncloud of dense smoke darkened the air, and the surrounding land soon\r\nbecame covered with ashes, pumice, and brimstone. As is common with\r\neruptions in Iceland, that have been preceded by long periods of rest,\r\nthe heat produced by the escaping lava and the sulphurous gases,\r\nmelted such quantities of ice that great floods were produced in the\r\nrivers.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of June vast torrents of lava that had been escaping\r\nfrom the craters entered the valley of the Skaptar River, and\r\ncommenced flowing through its channel. Immense quantities of steam\r\nwere produced, and, in less than twenty-four hours, the river was\r\ncompletely dried up, for the lava had collected in the channel,\r\nwhich in many places flows between high rocks from 400 to 600 feet\r\nin height and nearly 200 feet in breadth, and had not only filled\r\nthe river to its brink, but had overflowed the adjacent fields to a\r\nconsiderable extent, and flowing along the cultivated banks of the\r\nriver destroyed all the farms in its path.\r\n\r\nOn gaining the outlet, where the channel of the Skaptar emerged\r\ninto the plain, it might have been supposed that the burning flood\r\nwould have at once spread over the low fields, which lay immediately\r\nbefore it, but, contrary to all expectations, this flow was for a\r\ntime stopped by an immense unfathomed abyss in the river's bed, into\r\nwhich it emptied itself with great noise. When this chasm was at\r\nlast filled, the lava increased by fresh flows, rose to a prodigious\r\nheight, and breaking over the cooled mass, proceeded south towards the\r\nplain.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the thunder and lightning, together with subterranean\r\nroars, continued with little or no intermission.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of June, 1783, another dreadful eruption of red hot lava\r\ncame from the volcano. This flowed with great velocity and force over\r\nthe surface of the cooling stream that had been thrown out principally\r\non the tenth of the month. Floating islands consisting of masses of\r\nflaming rock were seen on the surface of the lava stream, and the\r\nwater that had been banked up on both sides of the stream was thrown\r\ninto violent boiling.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime people living along the Hverfisfloit, the next largest\r\nriver to the east of the Skaptar, had not yet been visited by the\r\nlava streams. It is true that their vegetation had been destroyed by\r\nshowers of red hot stone and ashes, and that both atmosphere and water\r\nwere filled with poisonous substances. The land had also been plunged\r\nin utter darkness, so that it was scarcely possible at noonday to\r\ndistinguish a sheet of white paper held up at the window from the\r\nblackness of the wall on either side. But the molten lava streams had\r\nnot yet reached the people of this valley and they hoped that the\r\neruption would soon be over, and that the lava flow would continue to\r\nfollow the Skaptar. On the 3d of August, however, they were alarmed by\r\nseeing steam escaping from the River Hverfisfloit, and soon all its\r\nwater was dried up, and a fresh lava flow poured down upon them. As in\r\nthe case of the Skaptar, the melted rock completely filled the empty\r\nchannel to the brink, and then overflowing, covered the low grounds on\r\nboth sides, so that by the ninth of August it had reached the open and\r\nlevel country near its mouth and in the course of a few hours spread\r\nitself for a distance of nearly six miles across the plain. This flow\r\ncontinued after the end of August, and, indeed, even as late as the\r\nmonth of February, 1784, when a new eruption took place in this part\r\nof the country.\r\n\r\nHecla, another well-known volcano in Iceland, situated about thirty\r\nmiles from the southern coast, consists of three peaks, the central of\r\nwhich is the highest. Its craters form vast hollows on the sides of\r\nthese peaks, and at the time of the eruption in 1766 were covered with\r\nsnow. Hecla is believed to have been an active volcano long before\r\nIceland was inhabited. No less than twenty-three eruptions have been\r\nrecorded between A. D. 1004 and the great eruption of 1766-68.\r\n\r\nVolcanic history frequently repeats itself. There had been no great\r\neruption of Hecla for a period of about twelve years, and the people\r\nliving in the neighborhood were congratulating themselves on the\r\nbelief that the mountain was becoming actually extinct, and that\r\ntherefore they need not trouble themselves about eruptions. Others,\r\nhowever, more farseeing, pointed out the fact that the lakes and\r\nrivers in the vicinity did not freeze, and that the amount of water\r\nthey contained was greatly decreased.\r\n\r\nThe following description of the great eruption of Hecla that was\r\nremarkable both for its violence, as well as for the time during which\r\nit continued, is taken from Symington's \"Sketches of Faroe Islands and\r\nIceland\":\r\n\r\n      \"On the 4th of April, 1766, there were some slight shocks\r\n      of an earthquake, and early next morning a pillar of sand,\r\n      mingled with fire and red hot stones, burst with a loud\r\n      thundering noise from its summit. Masses of pumice, six\r\n      feet in circumference, were thrown to the distance of ten\r\n      or fifteen miles, together with heavy magnetic stones,\r\n      one of which, eight pounds weight, fell fourteen miles\r\n      off, and sank into ground still hardened by the frost. The\r\n      sand was carried towards the northwest, covering the land,\r\n      150 miles round, four inches deep, impeding the fishing\r\n      boats along the coast, and darkening the air, so that at\r\n      Thingore, 140 miles distant, it was impossible to know\r\n      whether a sheet of paper was white or black. At Holum, 155\r\n      miles to the north, some persons thought they saw the stars\r\n      shining through the sand-cloud. About mid-day, the wind\r\n      veering round to the southeast, conveyed the dust into the\r\n      central desert, and prevented it from totally destroying\r\n      the pastures. On the 9th of April, the lava first appeared,\r\n      spreading about five miles towards the southwest, and on\r\n      the 23d of May, a column of water was seen shooting up in\r\n      the midst of the sand. The last violent eruption was on the\r\n      5th of July, the mountains, in the interval, often ceasing\r\n      to eject any matter; and the large stones thrown into the\r\n      air were compared to a swarm of bees clustering around the\r\n      mountain-top; the noise was heard like loud thunder forty\r\n      miles distant, and the accompanying earthquakes were more\r\n      severe at Krisuvik, eighty miles westward, than at half the\r\n      distance on the opposite side. The eruptions are said to\r\n      be in general more violent during a north or west wind than\r\n      when it blows from the south or east, and on this occasion\r\n      more matter was thrown out in mild than in stormy weather.\r\n      Where the ashes were not too thick, it was observed that\r\n      they increased the fertility of the grass fields, and\r\n      some of them were carried even to the Orkney Islands, the\r\n      inhabitants of which were at first terrified by what they\r\n      considered showers of black snow.\"\r\n\r\nThe largest volcano in Iceland is Dyngjufjoll. This has on its summit\r\nthe gigantic crater of Askja, some twenty-five square miles in area.\r\nThis crater is of the intermediate form; the most general form of\r\nvolcanoes on the island consisting of a number of craters that closely\r\nfollow fissures.\r\n\r\nProfessor Johnstrup, in a report to the Danish Government, on this\r\nvolcano, states that the valley of Askja has been gradually filled\r\nby repeated flows of lava from enormous craters on the edge of the\r\nmountain. In many places the surface of the earth is covered with\r\nbright red pumice stone that was thrown out during an eruption March\r\n29th, 1875. Some of these craters are filled with steam that escapes\r\nwith an almost deafening roar. The surprising feature of this eruption\r\nwas the immense quantity of pumice stone that escaped.\r\n\r\nThe volcanoes in the Nyvatus Oraefi are entirely different. This\r\nbarren plain is thirty-five miles in length and thirteen miles in\r\nbreadth. Suddenly on the 18th of February, 1875, a volcano appeared in\r\nthe centre, and four other craters were formed at subsequent dates.\r\nThe mass of lava that was thrown out of these openings has been\r\nestimated at 10,000,000,000,000 cubic feet, or eighteen times the\r\nestimated mass of lava that has been emitted from Vesuvius between\r\n1794 and 1855. This lava is basalt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nVESUVIUS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe old Greeks and Romans had but little knowledge of volcanoes. They\r\nonly knew the volcanic mountains in the Mediterranean Sea. Here there\r\nare three volcanic regions:--one in the neighborhood of Naples; one\r\nincluding Sicily and the neighboring islands, and the other that of\r\nthe Grecian Archipelago.\r\n\r\nSome idea can be had of these three regions from a map of the\r\nMediterranean shown in Fig. 12. The principal volcanoes are Vesuvius,\r\nEtna, Stromboli, and Vulcano, a mountain, by the way, that gave its\r\nname to all volcanic mountains. In this chapter we will describe the\r\nvolcano of Vesuvius, the most active, though by no means the largest\r\nof the volcanoes of the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nBut, before doing this, it will be well first to describe briefly the\r\nvolcanic districts surrounding Vesuvius.\r\n\r\nAs shown in Fig. 13, this district includes Vesuvius, Procida, and\r\nIschia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12. THE MEDITERRANEAN]\r\n\r\nIschia is a small island measuring about five miles from east to west,\r\nand three miles from north to south. There were such terrific volcanic\r\neruptions on this island long before the Christian Era, that several\r\nGreek colonies were forced to abandon it. A colony established long\r\nafterwards, about 380 B. C., by the king of Syracuse also\r\nhad to depart. Strabo, the Grecian geographer (born about 63 B.\r\nC.), states that, according to tradition, terrific earthquakes\r\noccurred on the island a little before his time, and its principal\r\nmountain threw out large quantities of molten rock, which flowed into\r\nthe sea. At the time of this eruption there were earthquake waves in\r\nthe sea, the waters of which slowly receded, leaving large portions\r\nof the bottom uncovered, and rushing, afterwards, violently over\r\nthe land, caused great destruction. It was during this disturbance,\r\nso Strabo asserts, that the island of Procida was formed by being\r\nviolently torn from Ischia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13. THE VOLCANIC DISTRICT AROUND VESUVIUS]\r\n\r\nThe Phlegræan Fields was a name given by the ancients to some of the\r\nlowlands in the neighborhood of Naples; they were believed to be under\r\nthe special protection of the Roman gods. When the frequent earthquake\r\nshocks shook these fields, the Roman people believed that conflicts\r\nwere taking place between their gods and slumbering giants confined in\r\nthe regions below the surface.\r\n\r\nIt is more than probable that Mt. Vesuvius has always been the centre\r\nof these volcanic disturbances. Long before the Christian Era,\r\nhowever, Vesuvius, or Somma, the name given to the old crater that\r\nthen occupied the summit of the mountain, had been an extinct crater.\r\nIndeed, it had been so quiet that the people who lived on its slopes\r\ndid not appear to know they were living on the slopes of a slumbering\r\nvolcano. Their knowledge of volcanic mountains must have been very\r\nlimited, for this mountain with the huge pit at its summit had all\r\nthe appearance of a volcanic crater. When they climbed to the top of\r\nthe mountain, which, of course, they frequently did to look after the\r\nvineyards they were cultivating on the slopes, and looked down into\r\nthe deep pit from the rocks on its edge, they could see at the bottom\r\nof a great central pit three miles in diameter, a lake, with room here\r\nand there to enable one to walk along its borders. The walls of the\r\nprecipice were covered with luxuriant vines.\r\n\r\nWhen we say that none of the people even suspected that Vesuvius had\r\never been in a state of eruption, we must except some of their learned\r\nmen. For both Diodorus Siculus, a native of Sicily, who lived about\r\n10 B. C., and wrote an Universal History, containing some\r\nforty volumes, of which only about one-third remain, and Strabo, the\r\nGeographer, pointed out in a general manner, that Vesuvius, and much\r\nof the surrounding country, looked as if it had been eaten by fire.\r\nThen, too, a Roman philosopher who lived between A. D. 1 and\r\nA. D. 64, spoke of Vesuvius being \"a channel for the eternal\r\nfire!\"\r\n\r\nLet us now endeavor to obtain some idea of the appearance of this\r\nregion a short time before A. D. 79, when Vesuvius burst\r\nforth in a terrific eruption. The slopes of the mountain were covered\r\nwith the rich vegetation that characterizes this part of Italy.\r\nWhen most volcanic ashes and lava have been exposed for some time to\r\nthe atmosphere they make a very fertile soil. Now, this soil on the\r\nslopes of Vesuvius made the vineyards that covered the mountain slopes\r\nand the fields for miles around its base, bear very plentifully,\r\nso that the people lived very comfortably. Here and there on the\r\nslopes of the mountain large towns like Herculaneum and Pompeii had\r\nlong been established, while, in the distance, was the large city of\r\nNaples. Besides these there were numerous populous towns and villages\r\nscattered here and there over the plain or on the lower mountain slope.\r\n\r\nYou have all probably read of the Roman gladiator, Spartacus.\r\nSpartacus was a Thracian by birth, and while a shepherd had been taken\r\nprisoner by the Romans and sold to a trainer of gladiators at Capua.\r\nChaffing under the tyranny of the Romans, who forced him to fight in\r\nthe arena with men and beasts, he revolted against his masters, and\r\nwith a band of some seventy followers, fled to a mountain fastness in\r\nthe crater of Vesuvius. Proud Rome sent a few men to recapture him,\r\nwith scourges for his punishment, but they were beaten by Spartacus.\r\nEvery day dissatisfied men like himself escaped from the Romans and\r\njoined his ranks. Rome sent a larger body of men against Spartacus,\r\nbut they also were beaten. At last, recognizing the gravity of the\r\nposition, the Roman Prætor, Clodius, was sent against Spartacus with\r\nan army of some three thousand men. Clodius caught Spartacus in the\r\ncrater and guarded the only space by which it seemed possible for\r\nSpartacus to escape. Using the vines that covered the precipitous\r\nwalls of the crater, Spartacus did escape, and falling unexpectedly\r\non the armies of Clodius, routed them. After this victory, Spartacus\r\nwith an army of over 100,000 men overran southern Italy, and sacked\r\nmany of the cities of the Roman Campania. During this time Spartacus\r\ndefeated one Roman army after another, until finally, in the year 71\r\nB. C., Crassus was sent against him and vainly endeavored\r\nto conquer him. Being unsuccessful, Crassus urged the Roman Senate\r\nto recall Lucullis from Asia and Pompey from Spain, and finally poor\r\nSpartacus was cut down in a fight he made against Crassus and Lucullis.\r\n\r\nBut let us come to the great eruption of Vesuvius in A. D.\r\n79. The people living on the slopes of Vesuvius were not without\r\nplenty of warnings of the dreadful catastrophe that was coming. As\r\nearly as A. D. 63 there was a great earthquake that shook the\r\ncountry far beyond Naples. In Pompeii, then a flourishing city, the\r\nTemple of Isis was so much damaged that it had to be rebuilt.\r\n\r\nEven if the earthquake shocks had not foretold the coming eruption,\r\nthere were other signs. The height of water in the wells decreased.\r\nSprings that had never before been known to fail, dried up completely.\r\nThese changes, as we well know, were due to the red hot lava being\r\nslowly forced up from great depths into the tube connected with the\r\ncrater.\r\n\r\nThe earthquake shocks continued at irregular intervals for sixteen\r\nyears, until, on the 25th of August, A. D. 79, about one\r\no'clock in the afternoon, Vesuvius burst forth in the terrible\r\neruption that destroyed the towns of Pompeii and Herculaneum. Pompeii\r\nwas a seaport town situated near the mouth of the River Sarno,\r\nabout fifteen miles southeast of Naples. It was a beautiful place,\r\ncontaining many splendid temples. Its people for the greater part\r\nlived luxuriously, for Pompeii was the summer resort of the richer\r\npeople of Naples, some of whom lived there during the hottest months\r\nof the year.\r\n\r\nHerculaneum, the other town, was nearer Naples, only five miles from\r\nthe city. It was also, like Pompeii, a beautiful town, and contained\r\nmany splendid buildings. In each town there were magnificent baths and\r\na large theatre. The inhabitants spent so much of their time in the\r\nopen air, or in the baths, that it was not necessary for them to build\r\nvery large houses. The houses, however, were well built, and though\r\ngenerally consisting of practically a single story, were provided with\r\nall the luxuries that great wealth could command.\r\n\r\nOn August 25th, A. D. 79, severe earthquake shocks again\r\nvisited this part of the world and Vesuvius suddenly threw up from\r\nits crater an immense column of black smoke, which, rising high in\r\nthe air, spread out in the form of a huge mushroom, or, perhaps, more\r\nlike the umbrella pine tree of the neighborhood. Rapidly spreading on\r\nall sides, the smoke soon completely shut out the light of the sun,\r\nand wrapped the earth in an inky darkness, except for a red glare from\r\ncolumns of molten rock that rushed out of the crater.\r\n\r\nFrom the dark cloud immense quantities of red hot stones, pumice, and\r\nvolcanic ashes descended on the earth. At the same time there fell\r\na deluge of rain, caused by the sudden condensation of the enormous\r\namount of water vapor that was thrown out from the crater during the\r\neruption. Fortunately, very few of the people were killed in either of\r\nthe cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum, although some bodies were found\r\nin the ruins. Most of the people escaped through the darkness and\r\ngloom, continuing to flee from the city for at least three days.\r\n\r\nBoth cities were covered so deep with ashes or mud that the tops of\r\nthe tallest buildings were no longer visible. Pompeii was buried by\r\nshowers of ashes or volcanic cinders, and Herculaneum mainly by vast\r\nfloods of aqueous lava.\r\n\r\nSo completely were these cities covered that their very existence was\r\nat last forgotten. It is true that Titus, who was then Emperor of\r\nRome, endeavored to clear away the ashes and rebuild Pompeii, but the\r\ntask was so great that he finally abandoned it.\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1592, the architect Fontana, while superintending the\r\nbuilding of an aqueduct, came across some ancient buildings. At a much\r\nlater date, in 1713, some workmen, while digging a well in the village\r\nof Portici, uncovered three marvellously beautiful marble statues. In\r\nthe year 1738, the same well was dug deeper, when traces of the old\r\ntheatre of Herculaneum were discovered. Some effort was then made to\r\nexcavate the city and many of the public buildings and private houses\r\nwere uncovered, and statues, mosaics, wall paintings, and charred\r\nmanuscripts of papyrus were found. A few of these have been unrolled\r\nand deciphered, but owing to the difficulty of doing this, without\r\ndestroying them, the greatest number still remain unread.\r\n\r\nIn 1860, the Italian Government began a systematic excavation of the\r\nburied cities, and now both Pompeii and Herculaneum are thrown open to\r\nthe sunlight so that one can walk through the old streets, and look\r\ninto the houses, in which, before A. D. 79, the people lived\r\nso happily.\r\n\r\nMany interesting stories are told about the discoveries that were\r\nmade during the government excavations. The skeleton of one of the\r\ninhabitants was found grasping a money bag. He might have escaped,\r\nbut had gone back to get his money. He got it, but remained with it.\r\nIn another place, the skeletons of a number of people were found in\r\nan underground room or cellar of a house, where were also found some\r\nmouldy bread and empty water flasks. Instead of leaving the city,\r\nwhich they might have done, they had retreated to the underground\r\nroom for safety, but the fine volcanic dust drifted in and suffocated\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe younger Pliny, the historian, has given an excellent account of\r\nsome features of this great eruption. It appears that his uncle was\r\nstationed with the Roman fleet, in the Bay of Naples, at the time of\r\nthe eruption. He describes the dark cloud of ashes that was formed\r\nover Vesuvius. He refers to the rapidity with which it spread, and\r\nto the showers of ashes, cinders, and stones that it rained down on\r\nthe earth. His uncle, the elder Pliny, landed on the coast, and was\r\nafterwards killed by a cloud of sulphurous vapor that swept down the\r\nside of the mountain.\r\n\r\nThe following letter from the younger Pliny, describing his flight\r\nwith his mother from Misenum, is quoted from Dana's \"Characteristics\r\nof Volcanoes.\"\r\n\r\n      \"It was now seven o'clock [on the morning of August 25th],\r\n      but the light was still faint and doubtful. The surrounding\r\n      buildings had been badly shaken, and although we were in\r\n      an open spot [a little yard between his uncle's house and\r\n      the sea], the space was so small that the danger of a\r\n      catastrophe from falling walls was great and certain. Not\r\n      till then did we make up our minds to go from the town....\r\n      When we were free from the buildings we stopped. There we\r\n      saw many wonders and endured many terrors. The vehicles we\r\n      had ordered to be brought out kept running backward and\r\n      forward, though on level ground; and even when blocked\r\n      with stones they would not keep still. Besides this, we\r\n      saw the sea sucked down and, as it were, driven back by\r\n      the earthquake. There can be no doubt that the shore had\r\n      advanced on the sea, and many marine animals were left high\r\n      and dry. On the other side was a dark and dreadful cloud,\r\n      which was broken by zigzag and rapidly vibrating flashes of\r\n      fire, and yawning showed long shapes of flame. These were\r\n      like lightning, only of greater extent....\r\n\r\n      \"Pretty soon the cloud began to descend over the earth\r\n      and cover the sea. It enfolded Capreæ and hid also the\r\n      promontory of Misenum.\" ... The flight was continued.\r\n      \"Ashes now fell, yet still in small amount. I looked\r\n      back. A thick mist was close at our heels, which followed\r\n      us, spreading out over the country, like an inundation.\"\r\n      ... Turning from the roar in order to avoid the fleeing,\r\n      terror-stricken throng, they rested. \"Hardly had we sat\r\n      down when night was over us--not such a night as when there\r\n      is no moon and clouds cover the sky, but such darkness as\r\n      one finds in close-shut rooms. One heard the screams of\r\n      women, the fretting cries of babes, and shouts of men....\r\n\r\n      \"Little by little it grew light again. We did not think\r\n      it the light of day, but a proof that the fire was coming\r\n      nearer. It was indeed fire, but it stopped afar off; and\r\n      then there was darkness again, and again a rain of ashes,\r\n      abundant and heavy, and again we rose and shook them off,\r\n      else we had been covered and even crushed by the weight....\r\n      At last the murky vapor rolled away, in disappearing smoke\r\n      or fog. Soon the real daylight appeared; the sun shone out,\r\n      of a lurid hue, to be sure, as in an eclipse. The whole\r\n      world which met our frightened eyes was transformed. It was\r\n      covered with ashes white as snow.\"\r\n\r\nYoung Pliny and his mother returned to Misenum, and survived the\r\nperils to which they were exposed.\r\n\r\nIt was during this eruption that a large part of the old crater was\r\nblown off the mountain by the tremendous force at work.\r\n\r\nThere have been many eruptions of Vesuvius since the great eruption\r\nof A. D. 79. One of these occurred during the reign of Severus,\r\nA. D. 203. It was during this eruption that an additional part of the\r\nold crater of Somma was blown away.\r\n\r\nAnother great eruption occurred A. D. 472. Then great\r\nquantities of volcanic dust were thrown up into the air, and falling,\r\ncovered practically all parts of Europe, producing darkening of the\r\nsun and great fear as far as the city of Constantinople.\r\n\r\nBut what was perhaps a still greater eruption occurred during December\r\nof 1631. This eruption spread great quantities of ashes over the\r\ncountry for hundreds of miles around, and great streams of mud rushed\r\ndown the slopes of the mountain. Buccini gives the following account\r\nof this eruption:\r\n\r\n      \"The crater was five miles in circumference, and about\r\n      1,000 paces deep. Its sides were covered with brushwood,\r\n      and at the bottom there was a plain on which cattle grazed.\r\n      In the woody parts wild boars frequently harbored. In one\r\n      part of the plain, covered with ashes, were three small\r\n      pools, one filled with hot but bitter water; another with\r\n      water saltier than the sea, and a third with water that\r\n      was hot but tasteless. But at length these forests and\r\n      grassy plains were consumed, being suddenly blown into the\r\n      air and their ashes scattered to the winds. In December,\r\n      1631, seven streams of lava poured at once from the crater\r\n      and overflowed several villages, on its flanks, and at the\r\n      foot of the mountain. Reisna, partly built over the ancient\r\n      city of Herculaneum, was consumed by the fiery torrent.\r\n      Great floods of mud were as destructive as lava. This is\r\n      no unusual occurrence during these catastrophes for such\r\n      is the violence of the rains produced by the evolution of\r\n      aqueous vapors that torrents of water descend the cone and\r\n      become charged with impalpable volcanic dust, and rolling\r\n      among ashes, acquire sufficient consistency to deserve the\r\n      ordinary appellation of aqueous lava.\"\r\n\r\nOf course, you will understand that we have given only a few of\r\nthe most notable of the eruptions of Mt. Vesuvius. Since the yea\r\nA. D. 1500 there have been no less than fifty-six recorded\r\neruptions, that of the year 1857 being especially violent.\r\n\r\nOmitting these eruptions we at last come to the great recent eruption\r\nof 1872.\r\n\r\nFortunately, the eruption of 1872, as well as still more recent\r\neruptions that have occurred, have been more accurately described than\r\nhave most volcanic eruptions, for the Italian Government, recognizing\r\nthe value to the natives of Italy of a knowledge of what was going on\r\nat the crater of Vesuvius, has maintained for the past thirty years\r\nan observatory on the western part of the mountain. This observatory\r\nhas been placed in charge of Prof. Luigi Palmieri, a well-known\r\nstudent of volcanoes and earthquakes. At this place records are kept\r\nof the behavior of the volcano, of all earthquake disturbances, as\r\nwell as other phenomena. At the same time, by the use of photography,\r\nexcellent pictures have been obtained showing the appearance of the\r\nsky during an eruption.\r\n\r\nVesuvius had been in a quiet state from November, 1848, to the year\r\n1871, when small quantities of lava flowed continuously for several\r\nmonths. Again, early in 1872, other quiet eruptions of lava continued\r\nfor weeks at a time. Finally, on April 26th, of that year, a violent\r\nexplosive eruption occurred. The following account has been taken from\r\nPalmieri's report, entitled, \"The Eruption of Vesuvius in 1872.\"\r\n\r\nOn April 23d the recording earthquake instruments, the seismographs,\r\nwere greatly affected. On the evening of the 24th lava streams flowed\r\ndown the cone in various directions. These streams were continued\r\non the 25th and the 26th, so that on the night of the 26th the\r\nobservatory lay between two streams of molten lava that threw out so\r\nmuch heat that the glass windows in the observatory were cracked,\r\nand a scorching smell was quite perceptible in the rooms. The cone\r\nof the mountain was deeply fissured, lava escaping freely from all\r\nthe fissures, so that the molten rock appeared to ooze from over its\r\nentire surface, or as Palmieri expressed it, \"Vesuvius sweated fire.\"\r\n\r\nThis great cracking or fissuring of the cone was accompanied by the\r\nopening of two large craters at the summit, that discharged, with a\r\ngreat noise, immense clouds of steam, dust, lapilli, and volcanic\r\nbombs. These latter are very curious and consist of masses of soft\r\nlava that are thrown high into the air by the outrushing columns of\r\nsteam. Being rotated or spun, as they rise in the air, they assume a\r\nspherical shape. Some of these volcanic bombs were thrown to a height\r\nestimated by Palmieri to have been nearly 4,000 feet above the top of\r\nthe mountain. When the height of a projectile is known, the velocity\r\nwith which it left the opening from which it was projected or thrown\r\ncan be estimated, so that the volcanic bombs must have left the crater\r\nat a velocity of about 600 feet per second.\r\n\r\nOn the 27th, in the evening, the lava streams ceased flowing, but the\r\ndust and lapilli continued to fall during the 28th and the 29th. On\r\nthe 30th the detonations decreased and by the 1st of May the eruption\r\nwas entirely over.\r\n\r\nPalmieri calculated that the quantity of molten rock thrown out during\r\nthis eruption was sufficient to cover an area of about 1.8 square\r\nmiles to an average depth of about thirteen feet.\r\n\r\nAs we can see from the above descriptions, the volcanic activity of\r\nVesuvius is characterized by long periods of rest followed by periods\r\nof activity. The periods of rest are measured by years, and often by\r\ncenturies; the periods of activity by days or hours.\r\n\r\nBut Vesuvius was not to have a long period of rest after its eruption\r\nof 1872. On the contrary, shortly after the great disaster of\r\nMartinique in 1906, it again became active, and on the 5th of April,\r\n1906, began throwing large blocks of lava out of its central cone, and\r\non the next day began to throw out large streams of lava, which, on\r\nApril 7th, destroyed a village in the neighborhood. At the same time\r\nrumbling sounds were heard, and violent earthquake shocks shattered\r\nthe windows of the houses.\r\n\r\nProfessor Matteucci, the present director of the Vesuvius Observatory,\r\nmade the following report on April the 8th.\r\n\r\n      \"The eruption of Vesuvius has assumed extraordinary\r\n      proportions. Yesterday and last night the activity of the\r\n      crater was terrific, and is increasing. The neighborhood\r\n      of the observatory is completely covered with lava.\r\n      Incandescent rocks are being thrown up by the thousands, to\r\n      a height of 2,400 feet or even 3,000 feet, and falling back\r\n      form a large cone. Another stream of lava has appeared....\r\n      The noise of the explosion and of the rocks striking\r\n      together is deafening. The ground is shaken by strong and\r\n      continuous seismic movements, and the seismic instruments\r\n      [instruments employed to record the time, direction, and\r\n      intensity of earthquake movements] threaten to break. It\r\n      will probably be necessary to abandon the observatory,\r\n      which is very much exposed to the shocks. The telegraph is\r\n      interrupted, and it is believed the Funicular railroad has\r\n      been destroyed.\"\r\n\r\nOn April 9th Matteucci made the following report:\r\n\r\n      \"The explosive activity of Vesuvius, which was so great\r\n      yesterday, and was accompanied by very powerful electric\r\n      discharges, diminished yesterday afternoon. During the\r\n      night the expulsion of rocks ceased, but the emission of\r\n      sand increased, completely enveloping me and forming a\r\n      red mass from six to ten centimeters deep, which carried\r\n      desolation into these elevated regions. Masses of sand\r\n      gliding along the earth, created complete darkness until\r\n      seven o'clock. Several blocks of stone broke windows in the\r\n      observatory. Last night the earthquake shocks were stronger\r\n      and more frequent than yesterday, and displaced the seismic\r\n      apparatus. Yesterday afternoon and this morning, torrents\r\n      of sand fell.\"\r\n\r\nOn April 10th Matteucci sent the following report:\r\n\r\n      \"Last night was calm, except for a few explosions of\r\n      considerable force from time to time. At four o'clock this\r\n      morning the explosions became more violent. The seismic\r\n      instruments recorded strong disturbances.\"\r\n\r\nThe eruption of Vesuvius of 1906 was especially noted for the great\r\nquantities of sand and ashes thrown out of the crater. The amount\r\nof sand that fell on the roof of the market house at Monti Olivetto\r\nwas so great that the roof fell in. In this eruption there were some\r\nsix lava streams that poured down the mountain. The most formidable\r\nof these was that which descended towards Torre Annunziata. Here it\r\nstopped just short of the wall of the cemetery outside of the town.\r\n\r\nDuring this eruption of Vesuvius, as in previous eruptions, clouds of\r\nvolcanic dust collected in the air, shutting off the light of the sun.\r\nNaples was in a state of semi-darkness. The roofs of the houses were\r\ncovered to a depth of several inches with an exceedingly fine reddish\r\ndust. In some places this dust had drifted into heaps fully a yard in\r\ndepth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nOTHER VOLCANOES OF THE MEDITERRANEAN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe relative positions of the other volcanic mountains of the\r\nMediterranean Sea; i. e., Etna, Stromboli, and the volcanoes of the\r\nSantorin group of the Grecian Archipelago, are shown in the map, Fig.\r\n12.\r\n\r\nWe will begin with the volcanic mountain of Etna, under which,\r\naccording to mythology, the angry gods had buried the rebellious\r\nTyphoon.\r\n\r\nEtna is situated on the island of Sicily, immediately southwest of\r\nItaly. It is a much larger mountain than Vesuvius, rising, as it\r\ndoes, from a circular base about eighty-seven miles around, to a\r\nheight of 10,840 feet above the level of the Mediterranean. It forms\r\na conspicuous object when seen either from the Mediterranean, or from\r\ndistant parts of Italy.\r\n\r\nThe height of Etna is so great that its slopes can be divided into\r\nthree distinct climatic zones or belts. The lowest of these lies\r\nbetween the sea and a height of 2,500 feet. In this zone the mountain\r\nslopes are covered with cultivated fields, olive groves, orchards,\r\nand vineyards. The middle zone lies between 2,500 feet and 6,270\r\nfeet. This zone is covered with forests of chestnuts, oaks, beeches,\r\nand cork trees. The third and highest zone includes the rest of the\r\nmountain, and may be called the desert zone, since it is a sterile\r\nregion, covered with huge blocks of lava and scoriæ, and terminating,\r\nin the higher portions, in a snow-covered plain, from which the\r\ncentral cone rises.\r\n\r\nEtna is continually sending up columns of steam and sulphur vapor.\r\nEvery now and then it starts in eruption, throwing out large\r\nquantities of lava either from the crater on its summit, or from\r\nsome of the 200 smaller cones or craters that occupy portions of its\r\nslopes. On account, probably, of its height the eruptions are most\r\nfrequently on the sides. Etna affords a magnificent example of a huge\r\nvolcanic pile of the Vesuvian type, which has been slowly built up\r\nby the gradual accumulation of materials that have escaped from its\r\ncraters.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting features of the higher regions of Etna is\r\nan immense chasm rent in a side of the cone near the summit, and known\r\nas the Val del Bove. This chasm forms a vast amphitheater.\r\n\r\nThe great force that removed such an immense mass of matter from\r\nthe cone could not have been the eroding power of water, since the\r\nmaterials of the cone are too porous to permit streams of any size to\r\nrush down the slopes. The force is most probably to be found in some\r\nexplosive eruption of the mountain, when a portion of the crater was\r\nsuddenly blown off, just as was done in Vesuvius when a large part of\r\nthe old crater of Somma was blown away. What is especially interesting\r\nabout the Val del Bove is the opportunity it affords for studying the\r\ninterior structure of the mountain, for it practically enables one to\r\nenter to almost the heart of this great volcano.\r\n\r\nThe Val del Bove has the shape of a great pit five miles in diameter.\r\nIt has almost vertical walls, the height of which varies with their\r\nposition. Those which reach highest up the mountain vary from 3,000 to\r\n4,000 feet in height.\r\n\r\nLike Vesuvius, Etna has been split or fissured into great crevices\r\nthat have been filled with lava during the many eruptions of its\r\ncentral crater. On hardening, these lava streams form what are known\r\nas dikes. As the sides of the mountain are worn away by erosion, the\r\ndikes, being harder than the rest of the cone, project from its sides\r\nlike huge walls. An excellent opportunity for seeing them is afforded\r\nin the walls of the Val del Bove.\r\n\r\nSir Charles Lyell, the English geologist, who has carefully studied\r\nMt. Etna, asserts that this mountain began to be formed during a\r\ngeological period known as the Tertiary Age, through a crater that\r\nopened on the floor of the Mediterranean Sea. The material thus\r\nthrown out, collected around the crater and produced a mountainous\r\npile that gradually emerged above the level of the sea, and on fresh\r\nmaterials continuing to be thrown out, at length reached its present\r\nheight. It would appear that at some former time in its history, there\r\nwere two vents near the top of the mountain, the second crater being\r\nformed immediately under the Val del Bove. Soon, however, the second\r\nand lower crater was closed, the upper one alone remaining active.\r\nThe mountain, therefore, continued to be slowly raised in the air by\r\nthe materials brought out through this opening. Then came the great\r\nexplosive eruption during which the side of the mountain was blown off\r\nto form the great chasm of the Val del Bove.\r\n\r\nBecause of its almost constant activity, Mt. Etna must have been\r\nwell known to the ancients, who described some of its most violent\r\neruptions. The following brief notes concerning these eruptions have\r\nbeen taken from Lyell.\r\n\r\nAccording to Diodorus Siculus, an eruption that occurred before the\r\nTrojan war, caused the people living in districts near the mountain to\r\nseek new homes. Thucididies, the Greek historian, states that in the\r\nsixth year of the Peloponnesian war, which would be about the spring\r\nof 425 B. C., a lava stream caused great destruction in the\r\nneighborhood of Campania, this being the third eruption that had\r\noccurred in Sicily since it had been settled by the Greeks.\r\n\r\nSeneca, during the first century of the Christian Era, calls the\r\nattention of Lucullus to the fact that during his time Mt. Etna had\r\nlost so much of its height that it could no longer be seen by boatmen\r\nfrom points at which it had before been readily visible.\r\n\r\nBut passing by these very early eruptions of Etna we come to the great\r\neruption of 1669. This eruption was preceded by an earthquake that\r\ndestroyed many houses in a town situated in the lower part of the\r\nforest zone, about twenty-five miles below the summit of the mountain,\r\nand ten miles from the sea at Catania. During this eruption two deep\r\nfissures were opened near Catania. From these such quantities of sand\r\nand scoriæ were thrown out, that, in the course of three or four\r\nmonths, a double cone was formed 450 feet high, which is now known as\r\nMonte Rosso. But what was most curious was the sudden opening, with\r\na loud crash, of a fissure six feet broad reaching down to unknown\r\ndepths that extended in a somewhat crooked course to within a mile\r\nof the summit of Etna. This great fissure was twelve miles in length\r\nand emitted a most vivid light. Five other parallel fissures of\r\nconsiderable length opened, one after another, throwing out vapor,\r\nand emitting bellowing sounds which were heard at a distance of forty\r\nmiles. These fissures were afterwards filled with molten rock, and in\r\nthis manner were formed the long dikes of porphyry and other rocks\r\nthat are seen to be passing through some of the older lavas of Mt.\r\nEtna.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14. MT. ETNA _From Map of State and\r\nGovernment_]\r\n\r\nThe great lava streams which flowed down the side of the mountain\r\nduring this eruption, destroyed fourteen towns and villages, and\r\nat length reached Catania. A great wall had been raised around this\r\ncity to prevent the lava from entering it. The molten rock, however,\r\naccumulated, until it rose to the top of the wall, which was sixty\r\nfeet high, and then pouring over it in a fiery cascade, overwhelmed\r\npart of the city. It is said that during the first part of its\r\njourney, the lava streams moved over thirteen miles in twenty days,\r\nor at the rate of 162 feet an hour. Beyond this, after the lava had\r\nthickened by cooling, it had a velocity of only twenty-two feet per\r\nhour.\r\n\r\nFig. 14 represents a plan of Mt. Etna reduced from a map by the\r\nItalian Government. During the eruption of 1865, a rent was made in\r\nthe mountain extending from Mount Frumento (B in the preceding map)\r\nfor one and one-half miles, and six cones from 300 to 350 feet in\r\nheight were formed along the fissure.\r\n\r\nDuring the eruption of 1874, great fissures three miles in length were\r\nformed in the mountain.\r\n\r\nThere exists on the slopes of Mt. Etna vast subterranean grottoes\r\nformed by the sudden conversion into steam of great quantities of\r\nwater that were overwhelmed by the molten mass. These immense volumes\r\nof steam produced enormous bubbles in the molten lava. When the lava\r\nhardened irregular grottoes were left. Lyell describes one of these as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n      \"Near Nicolosi, not far from Monte Rosso, one of these\r\n      great openings may be seen, called the _Fossa della\r\n      Palomba_, 625 feet in circumference at its mouth and\r\n      seventy-eight deep. After reaching the bottom of this, we\r\n      enter another dark cavity, and then others in succession,\r\n      sometimes descending precipices by means of ladders. At\r\n      length, the vaults terminate in a great gallery ninety feet\r\n      long, and from fifteen to fifty broad, beyond which there\r\n      is still a passage, never yet explored, so that the extent\r\n      of these caverns remains unknown. The walls and roofs of\r\n      these great vaults are composed of rough bristling scoriæ\r\n      of the most fantastic forms.\"\r\n\r\nBesides the eruptions mentioned there have been many others, such as\r\nthose of 1811, 1819, and 1852. The last of these was greater than any\r\neruption except that of 1669. It began in August, 1852, and continued\r\nuntil May, 1853, and was remarkable for the immense quantity of lava\r\nthrown out.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15. STROMBOLI, VIEWED FROM THE NORTHWEST,\r\nAPRIL, 1874]\r\n\r\nWe come now to the volcano of Stromboli. Stromboli, one of the Lipari\r\nislands, is situated about sixteen miles west of the Straits of\r\nMessina. Its general appearance is shown in Fig. 15. The form of the\r\nmountain is that of an irregular four-sided pyramid, which rises about\r\n3,090 feet above the level of the Mediterranean, and stands on the\r\nbottom of the sea in water about 3,000 feet deep.\r\n\r\nIf you carefully examine the appearance of Stromboli, as shown in the\r\npreceding figure, you will notice that the flat cloud which hangs over\r\nthe island is made up of a number of globular masses of vapor, formed\r\nduring the peculiar action of the volcano.\r\n\r\nWhen examined by night Stromboli presents a still more curious\r\nappearance. Since the mountain stands alone, its height permits it to\r\nbe seen readily at sea for distances of at least a hundred miles. At\r\nnight a curious glow of red light may be seen on the lower surfaces of\r\nthe cloud. This light is not continuous, but increases in intensity\r\nfrom a faint glow to a fairly bright red light, then gradually\r\ndecreases, and finally dies away completely. After awhile the light\r\nagain appears, again gradually decreases, and disappears, and this\r\ncontinues until the rising sun prevents the red glow from being any\r\nlonger visible. Stromboli, therefore, acts not unlike the flashing\r\nlighthouses so common on the sea coasts of all parts of the world.\r\nIndeed, it is actually used by sailors in the Mediterranean for the\r\npurpose of showing them their direction. For this reason Stromboli is\r\ncommonly called \"The Lighthouse of the Mediterranean.\"\r\n\r\nAs Judd remarks, from whom much of the information concerning some of\r\nthe volcanic districts of the Mediterranean has been obtained, the\r\nflashing light of Stromboli differs from that of the ordinary flashing\r\nlight in two important respects; viz., in the intervals that elapse\r\nbetween the successive flashes, and in the intensity of the light\r\nemitted. As you know, it is necessary that the different lighthouses\r\nplaced near one another on a coast must have their lights of such a\r\nnature that they can be readily distinguished. In order to do this,\r\nthe flashing light has been devised. In flashing lighthouses, the\r\nlights only appear at intervals, one lighthouse being distinguished\r\nfrom another in its neighborhood by the intervals between successive\r\nflashes, or, sometimes, indeed, by the color of some of the flashes.\r\nNow, in the case of Stromboli, the intervals between the successive\r\nglowings of the red lights are very irregular, varying between one and\r\ntwenty flashes per second. Moreover, the intensity of the light also\r\nvaries greatly from time to time.\r\n\r\nYou naturally inquire as to the cause of these flashes of light that\r\nare emitted by Stromboli. If, as Judd suggests, you should climb to\r\nthe summit of the mountain, during the daytime, and look down the\r\ninside of the crater, you could see its black slag bottom crossed by\r\nmany cracks and fissures. From most of the smaller fissures the vapor\r\nof water is quietly escaping. This vapor rises in the air in which it\r\nsoon disappears. There are, however, larger cracks on the bottom of\r\nthe crater from which, at more or less regular intervals, masses of\r\nsteam are emitted with loud snorting puffs not unlike those produced\r\nby a locomotive. From some of the openings molten matter is seen\r\nslowly oozing out, collecting in parts of the crater and moving up and\r\ndown in a heaving motion. Every now and then a bubble is formed on\r\nthe surface of this liquid. The bubble swells to a gigantic size, and\r\nsuddenly bursts. The steam it contained escapes, carrying fragments of\r\nscum which are thrown high into the air. The masses of steam, formed\r\nbelow the surface of the sticky, boiling, lava, in endeavoring to\r\nescape, force their way through the mass, blow huge bubbles, which,\r\non bursting, produce the roaring sounds that are heard, and throwing\r\ngreat columns of vapor in the air, produce the rounded masses of\r\nclouds you can see floating high up in the air over the mountain. At\r\nthe same time the scum is partially removed from the red hot surface,\r\nits light illumines the lower surface of the overhanging cloud, which\r\nflings it back again to the earth. With the bursting of each bubble,\r\nand the clearing of the scum from the surface of the red hot mass,\r\nthe light begins, increases in intensity, and then as the scum again\r\nbegins to collect on the surface, decreases, and finally disappears,\r\nand not until the bursting of the next bubble is it again visible.\r\n\r\nBut let us make a study of some of the peculiarities of Vulcano,\r\nanother of the Lipari islands, which lies north of Sicily.\r\n\r\nVulcano affords a curious example of a volcano that has been harnessed\r\nby man, or made to do work for him. All volcanoes bring from inside\r\nof the earth different kinds of chemical substances, in the form of\r\nvapors, gases, or molten materials. Now, these materials acting on\r\none another, produce chemical substances some of which, such as sal\r\nammoniac, sulphur, and boracic acid, possess commercial value. This is\r\nespecially true in the case of Vulcano, and since the eruptions are\r\nnot generally violent, a chemical works has actually been erected by\r\na Scotch firm on the side of the mountain, where the materials are\r\ncollected from the crevices.\r\n\r\nThis effort to harness a volcano was for a time so successful that\r\nthe same people contemplated the building of great leaden chambers\r\nover the principal fissure at the bottom of the crater, so that the\r\nlarge volumes of ejected vapors might be condensed and collected. But\r\nVulcano, like all other volcanoes, could not be relied on continually\r\nto keep the peace. One day it suddenly burst forth more fiercely than\r\nusual, so that the workmen were compelled to abandon the factory and\r\nfly down the mountain for their lives, but not, however, before some\r\nof them were severely injured by the explosions.\r\n\r\nVulcano is an instance of a volcano in an almost exhausted or dormant\r\ncondition. It has had, however, many eruptions during the past few\r\ncenturies, some of which have been very violent, for example, that of\r\n1783, and that of 1786.\r\n\r\nThere still remains to be considered the volcanic region of the\r\nSantorin group of the Grecian Archipelago. The island of Santorin\r\nor Thera, is the southernmost of the Cyclades. It is an exceedingly\r\ncurious island, being a submerged volcano, with most of the top of the\r\ncrater remaining above the waters, so that the entire island has the\r\nshape of an irregular circle or crescent broken at several points.\r\nIts formation is, probably, due to the gradual sinking of a volcanic\r\nmountain until its crater has been almost completely submerged, only\r\nthe higher parts of the edges of the crater being left above the\r\nsurface of the waters. Suppose, for example, a mountain like Vesuvius\r\nat the time the crater Somma existed, was sunk below the level of the\r\nMediterranean until only the highest parts of the crater remained\r\nabove the waters. If, now, one or more volcanic eruptions occurred,\r\nproducing craters or volcanic islands inside the submerged rim, you\r\nwould have a condition of affairs seen in the island of Santorin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nORIZABA, POPOCATEPETL, IXTACCIHUATL, AND OTHER VOLCANOES OF MEXICO\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile some of the volcanoes of Mexico are still in an active\r\ncondition, most of them are either only slightly active or are dormant\r\nor extinct. Humboldt, the celebrated traveller and geographer, states\r\nthat there are only four active volcanic mountains in Mexico; namely,\r\nPopocatepetl, Tuxtula, Colima, and Jorullo. But there are many others,\r\namong which may be mentioned Orizaba, Ixtaccihuatl, Xinantecatl,\r\nTuxtula, Cofre de Perote, and Colima.\r\n\r\nOf course, you can understand that, since extinct volcanoes may at any\r\ntime become active, in parts of the world where communication with the\r\ninterior is not good, many volcanic mountains that have been regarded\r\nas extinct may have broken out temporarily, during historical times,\r\nwithout their eruptions having been recorded.\r\n\r\nIt was at one time thought that Popocatepetl was the highest mountain\r\nin North America. More recent measurements, however, have shown that\r\nthere are at least three other mountains in this part of the world,\r\nthat are much higher. One of these is the active volcano of Orizaba\r\nthat we will now briefly describe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16. MEXICO AND CENTRAL AMERICA]\r\n\r\nOrizaba is situated in the north central part of Mexico, about\r\nseventy-five miles west of Vera Cruz. Its ancient Aztec name was\r\nCittaltepetl, or _Star Mountain_. The height of the mountain is\r\n18,200 feet. Like all high tropical mountains whose summits are\r\nsnow-clad, one would pass through the same changes in climate, in\r\ngoing from its base to its summit, as in going along the earth's\r\nsurface from the equator to the poles. Near the base of the mountain\r\nwill be found a tropical climate, above that a temperate climate,\r\nwhile in still higher regions, the climate of the Arctic region.\r\n\r\nAccording to Russell, from whose work on the volcanoes of North\r\nAmerica much of the information concerning the volcanoes of Mexico\r\nand Central America has been condensed, Orizaba has three craters on\r\nits summit. The last recorded eruption took place about the middle of\r\nthe Eighteenth Century. The mountain is now in a dormant or extinct\r\ncondition, as may be seen from the fact that its three craters are for\r\nthe greater part filled with snow.\r\n\r\nOrizaba, like Etna, and many other volcanoes, has deep fissures\r\nextending through its sides. Through these, lava streams have flowed\r\nduring times when it was active. There are also found on the slopes\r\nof this mountain many cones of a type known as _parasitic cones_.\r\nThese cones are not caused by materials that have been brought to the\r\nsurface during an eruption, but have been formed by the steam passing\r\nthrough lava streams that have come out of the crater during other\r\neruptions.\r\n\r\nPopocatepetl, or, as the word means, _The Smoking Mountain_, is the\r\nsecond highest mountain in Mexico. According to recent measurements\r\nmade by the Mexican Government, its height is 17,876 feet.\r\nPopocatepetl is situated on the edge of the great plateau of Mexico,\r\nforty miles southeast of the City of Mexico. It is a conical mountain,\r\nand is a magnificent object when seen from the City of Mexico, rising,\r\nas it does, fully 10,000 feet from the elevation of the city, while on\r\nthe east it towers for nearly 18,000 feet above the level of the sea.\r\nThis splendid mountain is poetically described by Russell:\r\n\r\n      \"Seen from the basal plains, it sweeps up in one grand\r\n      curve to nearly its full height,--a collossus of three and\r\n      a quarter miles in elevation, white with everlasting frost\r\n      on its summit, and bathed in the green of palms, bananas,\r\n      oranges, and mangoes, at its base. Evergreen oaks and\r\n      pines encircle its middle height, and above them, before\r\n      the ice itself is reached, occur broad areas of loose sand\r\n      into which the lavas have been changed by weathering. Soft\r\n      wreaths of sulphurous vapor may at times be seen curling\r\n      over the crest of the summit crater,--gentle reminders that\r\n      the days of volcanic activity are not yet necessarily over.\"\r\n\r\nPopocatepetl takes its name, _The Smoking Mountain_ from the fact that\r\ngases and vapor are continually being emitted from its summit crater.\r\nIt has a conical peak with a depression or crater on its summit.\r\nThe bottom of the crater is crossed by fissures from which small\r\nquantities of steam escape, not, however, sufficient to melt all the\r\nsnow which covers the slopes of the mountain to a depth of from eight\r\nto ten feet. A small lake of hot water has collected in the crater\r\nfrom the water derived from the melting snow. This water, sinking\r\nthrough the porous materials in the cone, is the source of a great\r\nnumber of large hot springs that occur around the base of the mountain.\r\n\r\nReclus states that the first to climb to the top of Popocatepetl was\r\none of Cortez' officers, 1519.\r\n\r\nAnother snow-capped volcano, which rising from the plain of Mexico is\r\nin clear view of the city, is Ixtaccihuatl (Ets-tak'-se-wat-el), or as\r\nthe word means in the ancient Aztec, _The White Woman_. This mountain,\r\nas measured by Heilprin, is 16,960 feet in height. Ixtaccihuatl is\r\nnow in so dormant a condition that many who have climbed to the top\r\nassert that it is not a volcano at all, since they find no crater on\r\nits summit. Nor are there any signs of volcanic heat, the summit being\r\nsnow clad during summer. The conical form of the mountain, however,\r\nand the fact that the entire mountain is formed of volcanic rocks,\r\nshow beyond doubt that it is an extinct volcano, whose crater has most\r\nprobably been completely filled in by the washing away of its sides.\r\n\r\nXinantecatl is another extinct volcanic mountain situated about forty\r\nmiles southwest of the City of Mexico. It is about 16,500 feet high.\r\nIts name means in the ancient Aztec language, _The Naked Lord_. It is\r\nalso sometimes known as the Nevado de Toluca, or _The Snow of Toluca_.\r\nOn the top of the peak are two craters filled with lakes of fresh\r\nwater. Russell states that the larger of these lakes is about thirty\r\nfeet in depth and contain a peculiar species of fish.\r\n\r\nTuxtula is another volcano of Mexico, situated on the western coast\r\nof the Gulf of Mexico, about eighty miles southeast of Vera Cruz. It\r\nwas an active volcano in 1664, when it threw out molten lava. It then\r\nbecame dormant until March, 1793, when its long rest was broken by one\r\nof the grandest explosive eruptions of modern times. This eruption\r\nrivalled in energy the great explosive eruption which blew off the\r\nsummit of Coseguina, in Central America, in 1835. As is common in the\r\ncase of explosive eruptions, volcanic dust and scoriæ were blown high\r\ninto the air, and, being carried by the winds, fell on the roofs of\r\nhouses and on the land at a distance of 150 miles.\r\n\r\nThere have been a number of less violent eruptions of Tuxtula since\r\n1835. Tuxtula is a comparatively low mountain, being only 4,960 feet\r\nhigh, because much of the mountain was blown away by the eruption of\r\n1793.\r\n\r\nAs Russell points out, it is not safe to infer that because an eroded\r\nmountain is not lofty it cannot be young or energetic, since the very\r\nenergy of some of its eruptions may, as in the case of Tuxtula, blow\r\naway a large part of the mountain. A low mountain, with an unusually\r\nlarge crater, generally means a mountain that has been visited by a\r\ngreat explosive eruption.\r\n\r\nAnother extinct volcano known as the Cofre de Perote is situated on\r\nthe eastern coast of Mexico, east of Ixtaccihuatl, about thirty miles\r\nnorth of Orizaba. It takes its name Cofre de Perote which means the\r\nCoffin of Perote, from its peculiar box-like shape. It was called in\r\nthe Aztec language \"Nauhcampatepetl,\" or the _Four-Ridged Mountain_.\r\nCofre de Perote is in a dormant or extinct condition.\r\n\r\nWe will conclude this brief description of the volcanoes of Mexico\r\nwith the volcano of Colima, a mountain about 5,500 feet high situated\r\non the western coast of Mexico.\r\n\r\nColima has been active of recent years, eruptions having occurred in\r\n1869, 1872, 1873, and 1885. During these eruptions lava escaped from\r\nlateral openings in the sides of the mountain, these openings being\r\ntermed by the natives the _Sons of Colima_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nCOSEGUINA AND OTHER VOLCANOES OF CENTRAL AMERICA\r\n\r\n\r\nCentral America has a great number of volcanoes extending along nearly\r\nall its western coast, or on the Pacific side of the country.\r\n\r\nCentral America consists of a high plain or table-land sloping gently\r\ntowards the northeast, but terminating abruptly on the southwest. In\r\nthe opinion of geologists this table-land consists of the surface of a\r\nhuge tilted block of the earth's crust, or, perhaps, more probably, of\r\na series of such blocks, that are limited on the southwest by a narrow\r\nbelt of intersecting fractures. It is in these fractures that scores\r\nof volcanoes are situated, together with active craters, solfataras,\r\nand hot springs. The volcanoes are mainly of the Vesuvian type. There\r\nare so many volcanoes in this part of the world that it will be\r\npossible to describe but a few of them.\r\n\r\nWe will begin with the volcano of Coseguina, situated on the Pacific\r\ncoast of Nicaragua. Its appearance is that of a conical mountain with\r\nthe top cut off, and suggests that it is most probably an explosive\r\nvolcano which has had the top blown away during some of its great\r\neruptions.\r\n\r\nCoseguina is celebrated by reason of its tremendous eruption of 1835.\r\nBefore the still more tremendous explosive eruption of Krakatoa in\r\n1883, described in the first two chapters of this book, Coseguina\r\nshared with Sombawa, on the island of Sumatra, as being the foremost\r\nof explosive volcanoes.\r\n\r\nIt had been estimated that before its eruption of 1835, Coseguina had\r\na height of perhaps 10,000 feet, but so much of it was blown away by\r\nthis eruption that it now is a little less than 4,000 feet.\r\n\r\nThe following description of the great eruption of Coseguina in 1835\r\nhas been condensed from an account prepared by Squier, published in\r\n1850.\r\n\r\nYou will note in reading this brief account how closely many of the\r\nphenomena resemble those that occurred during the eruption of Krakatoa\r\nin 1833.\r\n\r\nThe eruption of Coseguina was heralded on the morning of January 20th,\r\n1835, by several loud explosions that were heard for a distance of\r\nsome 300 miles around the crater of the volcano. Then followed an ink\r\nblack cloud formed directly over the mountain, which gradually spread\r\non all sides shutting off the light of the sun, except for a sickly\r\nyellowish light. Fine sand was thrown from this cloud, which made it\r\nboth difficult and painful to breathe. For two whole days the cloud\r\ncontinued to grow denser, the explosions louder and more frequent,\r\nand the rain of sand thicker. On the third day the explosions were\r\nstrongest and the darkness greatest.\r\n\r\nThe amount of sand that fell from the cloud was so great that people\r\nleft their houses, fearing the roofs would be crushed in by the great\r\nweight. This sand fell in large quantities over an area more than\r\n1,500 miles in diameter, or, quoting the language of Squier:\r\n\r\n      \"The noise of the explosions was heard nearly as far\"\r\n      (1,500 miles). \"And the Superintendent of Belize, eight\r\n      hundred miles distant, mustered his troops, under the\r\n      impression that there was a naval action off the harbor.\r\n      All nature seemed overawed; the birds deserted the\r\n      air, and the wild beasts their fastnesses, crouching,\r\n      terror-stricken and harmless, in the dwellings of men.\r\n      The people for a hundred leagues grouped, dumb with\r\n      terror, amidst the thick darkness, bearing crosses on\r\n      their shoulders and stones on their heads in penitential\r\n      abasement and dismay. Many believed that the day of doom\r\n      had come, and crowded in the tottering churches, where, in\r\n      the pauses of the explosions, the voices of the priests\r\n      were heard in solemn invocation to Heaven. The brightest\r\n      lights were invisible at the distance of a few feet; and\r\n      to heighten the terror of the scene, occasional lightnings\r\n      traversed the darkness, shedding a lurid glare over the\r\n      earth. This continued for forty-three hours, and then\r\n      gradually passed away.\"\r\n\r\nIt appears that the eruption of Coseguina was followed by violent\r\nearthquake shocks and other evidences of volcanic energy over extended\r\nregions. For example, there were fearful earthquakes along the Andes,\r\nthe worst of which occurred on February 20th, and continued at the\r\nrate of three or four a day up to March 6th, and, less frequently,\r\nto March 17th. It was during one of these earthquakes that the city\r\nof Concepcion, Chile, was so completely destroyed, that but a single\r\nhouse remained.\r\n\r\nThe same brilliant sunsets and sunrises occurred in different parts\r\nof the world after the eruption of Coseguina, due to the presence of\r\nlarge quantities of volcanic dust that followed the great eruption of\r\nKrakatoa.\r\n\r\nThe cause of this great explosive eruption of Coseguina was most\r\nprobably the same as that which is believed to have caused the\r\neruption of Krakatoa, namely, a large volume of water suddenly gaining\r\naccess to a mass of liquid lava.\r\n\r\nVolcán del Fuego is another of the many volcanoes of Central America.\r\nIt is situated as one of a group of volcanoes on the highest summit\r\nof the Isthmus. This volcanic mountain has a regular cone with\r\nregular slopes on all sides, except on the north, where a table-like\r\nprojection, about 1,000 feet below the summit, is all that remains of\r\na vast cone, the summit of which was blown away, according to Russell,\r\nin prehistoric times, just as was the crater of Somma on Vesuvius.\r\n\r\nThere have been in Central America, since the time of the Spanish\r\nconquest, some fifty volcanic eruptions sufficiently great to have\r\nbeen recorded. Some idea of the activity of Fuego during this time\r\nmay be had from the fact that of all these eruptions some twenty were\r\nthose of Fuego. At the present time, however, the volcano is dormant\r\nand apparently almost extinct.\r\n\r\nThe recorded eruptions of Fuego are nearly all of the explosive type.\r\nAmong the most violent were those that occurred during 1526, 1541,\r\nand 1581. During 1582, 1585, and 1586, there were eruptions nearly\r\nevery month, the most terrible being near Christmas day in 1586. Other\r\nmemorable eruptions occurred in 1614, 1623, 1686, and 1705, and at\r\nother dates down to August 17th, 1860, from which date to the present\r\ntime the volcano has been quiet.\r\n\r\nWe will conclude this brief description of the volcanoes of Central\r\nAmerica with that of Volcán de Agua, or, as the word means, _The Water\r\nVolcano_. It is situated in Guatemala near the coast, and is one of\r\nthe mountains that occupies the plateau on which Fuego is situated.\r\n\r\nThe Volcán de Agua is one of the most remarkable volcanoes in Central\r\nAmerica, standing, as it does, nearly alone, and rising to an\r\nelevation of 3,350 metres (10,988 ft.), above the level of the sea. It\r\nhas been extinct for a long time.\r\n\r\nIt has been supposed by some, from its name, that this is a volcano\r\nthat throws out water. Others believe that the name comes from the\r\nwater produced by the melting of the snow that is collected on the\r\nsides of the mountain. Now there almost always escapes from the\r\ncraters of volcanoes during violent eruptions immense quantities of\r\nwater vapor, which, condensing, fall as vast showers of rain that\r\noften deluge the surrounding country. In snow-clad mountains, the\r\nescape of lava is often attended by floods caused by the rapid melting\r\nof the snow. The water volcano did not, however, take its name from\r\neither of these facts, but rather because at the time of the Spanish\r\ninvasion, the crater of the mountain was occupied by a large lake, and\r\nthat during an earthquake in 1541 the wall of the crater was broken,\r\nwhen the lake was poured as an immense stream of water down the side\r\nof the mountain, overwhelming a village which was situated on this\r\nslope. That this was the correct origin of the same may be seen from\r\nthe fact that the crater at the present time still shows the remains\r\nof its former lake basin, and that on the sides of the broken rim an\r\nimmense ravine can be seen through which the water poured down on the\r\nvillage below.\r\n\r\nDaubeny describes this volcano as follows:\r\n\r\n      \"The Volcán de Agua (Water-Volcano) is of enormous height,\r\n      being covered with eternal snow, in the latitude of 14°.\r\n      Captain Basil Hall estimates it at more than 14,000 feet,\r\n      but a recent traveller states it at 12,600. It has the form\r\n      of a blunted cone clothed with perpetual verdure to its\r\n      summit. The crater is from forty to sixty yards in depth,\r\n      and about 150 in diameter,--the sides and bottom strewed\r\n      with masses of rock, apparently showing the effects of\r\n      boiling water or of fire.\r\n\r\n      \"By a deluge of water from this volcano in 1527, the\r\n      original city of Guatemala was overwhelmed; and the next\r\n      built, called the Old City, _La Antiqua_, was ruined by an\r\n      earthquake in 1773. The present capital is situated at a\r\n      distance of eight leagues from the mountain.\"\r\n\r\nAnother volcano in this part of the country is described by Daubeny as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n      \"Massaya, near the lake of that name, was one of the most\r\n      active vents at the time of the first discovery of the\r\n      country. Its flames were visible twenty-five miles off. Its\r\n      crater was only twenty or thirty paces in diameter; but\r\n      the melted lava 'seethed and rolled in waves as high as\r\n      towers.' A story is told of a Dominican who imagined the\r\n      fluid lava was melted gold, and descended into the crater\r\n      with an iron ladle to carry some away; but the ladle, it is\r\n      said, melted, and the monk escaped with difficulty.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE VOLCANIC MOUNTAINS OF SOUTH AMERICA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe volcanoes of South America are limited to the Andes Mountain\r\nSystem that stretches like a huge wall along the entire western side\r\nof the continent. The names of the more important of these volcanoes\r\nare marked on the map of South America, shown in Fig. 17. As will be\r\nseen, this huge mountain wall reaches from Patagonia on the south to\r\nthe Isthmus of Panama on the north. The arrangement of the volcanoes\r\nin South America is of the linear type. The craters follow one another\r\nin more or less straight lines, or are situated along the lines of\r\ngreat fissures that lie near the ocean. You must not, however, suppose\r\nthat there is a continuous chain of active volcanic mountains from the\r\nIsthmus of Panama to the southern part of the continent. According to\r\nLyell, from lat. 2° N., or from the north of Quito, to lat. 43° S. or\r\nsouth of Chile, a total distance including 45° of latitude, there is a\r\nsuccession of districts with active and extinct volcanoes, or at least\r\nwith volcanoes that have been quiet during the last three centuries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17. SOUTH AMERICA]\r\n\r\nLyell traces the volcanoes of South America as follows:\r\n\r\n      \"The principal line of active vents which have been seen in\r\n      eruption in the Andes extends from lat. 43° 28' S., ... to\r\n      lat. 30° S.; to these thirteen degrees of latitude succeed\r\n      more than eight degrees, in which no recent volcanic\r\n      eruptions have been observed. We then come to the volcanoes\r\n      of Bolivia and Peru, extending six degrees from S. to N.,\r\n      or from lat. 21° S. to lat. 15° S. Between the Peruvian\r\n      volcanoes and those of Quito another space intervenes of no\r\n      less than fourteen degrees of latitude, in which there is\r\n      said to be but few active volcanoes as far as is yet known.\r\n      The volcanoes of Quito then succeed, beginning about 100\r\n      geographical miles south of the equator, and continuing\r\n      for about 150 miles north of it, when there occurs another\r\n      undisturbed region of more than six degrees of latitude,\r\n      after which we arrive at the volcanoes of Guatemala, or\r\n      Central America, north of the Isthmus of Panama.\"\r\n\r\nOf course, you must not understand that there are no extinct volcanoes\r\nin these gaps. On the contrary, according to Daubeny, we find,\r\nbeginning on the north in the United States of Colombia, the lofty\r\nvolcano of Tolima. According to Daubeny's book published in 1848,\r\nTolima was then constantly emitting steam and sulphur gases from its\r\nsummit. Tolima is situated in the easternmost of the three mountain\r\nranges that extend through this section of the country. It is,\r\ntherefore, at a comparatively great distance from the ocean. Tolima\r\nwas in eruption in 1595. It again burst out in 1826.\r\n\r\nComing now to Ecuador we find that this, the smallest of the South\r\nAmerican Republics, contains numerous great volcanic mountains.\r\n\r\nSome of the principal volcanic mountains are Chimborazo, 20,498 feet\r\nabove the sea; Antisana, 18,880 feet; Cotopaxi, 19,660 feet; Pichincha\r\n(17,644 feet in 1848, Daubeny), El Altar, 16,383 feet.\r\n\r\nThese all lie in South America on the plateau of Quito. As Baron\r\nAlexander von Humboldt has pointed out, the volcanic mountains of\r\nQuito are arranged in two parallel chains that extend side by side\r\nfor a distance of over 500 miles north into the State of Colombia,\r\nincluding between them the high plateaus of Quito and Lacumbia.\r\nAccording to Whymper, however, who has recently studied this part of\r\nSouth America, there is a succession of basins between the mountains,\r\nbut there is no such thing as a single valley in the interior of\r\nEcuador. The extinct volcanoes of Cayamba, Antisana, and Chimborazo\r\nare the most important. On all three mountains there are old lava\r\nstreams on their sides. Although no craters can be seen on their\r\nsummits, yet it is almost certain they once had craters. There is\r\nplenty of room on the summit of Antisana for a cone as great as that\r\nof Cotopaxi. Whymper is of the opinion that the snow domes that form\r\nthe summit of Chimborazo were at one time two of the highest points of\r\nthe rim of the old crater.\r\n\r\nNearly due south of Quito is the great volcanic cone of El Altar.\r\nLike all the peaks of this high plateau, El Altar rises to a great\r\nheight above the sea, being at the present time 16,383 feet above the\r\nsea. This mountain has an enormous crater that appears to be dormant\r\nor extinct, and is covered with snow. According to the traditions of\r\nIndians, El Altar, or, as they call it, _Capac Urcu_ or _The Chief_,\r\nwas the highest mountain near the equator, being much higher than\r\nChimborazo. But during a prodigious eruption that occurred before the\r\ndiscovery of America, and continued uninterruptedly for eight years,\r\nthe height of the mountain was considerably reduced. According to\r\nBoussingault, the fragments of the cone of this celebrated mountain\r\nare now spread for great distances around the mountain on the\r\nsurrounding lowlands.\r\n\r\nPichincha in Ecuador, an extinct volcano, is situated almost\r\nimmediately on the equator. It has a height as measured by Whymper by\r\nthe barometer, of 15,918 feet above the Pacific. The summit is covered\r\nby blocks of pumice. Several species of lichens are found at this\r\nelevation. According to Daubeny, Pichincha was extinct prior to 1539,\r\nwhen it became active. There were also eruptions in 1577, 1587, and\r\n1668. It was also in activity during 1831.\r\n\r\nCayamba, another volcanic mountain of Ecuador, lies to the east of\r\nPichincha, a short distance north of the equator. Its height is 19,186\r\nfeet. It is nearly extinct.\r\n\r\nCotopaxi, 19,680 feet, is another volcanic mountain of the high\r\nplateau of Quito. Cotopaxi is still active. Its slopes are covered\r\nwith snow down to a height of about 14,800 feet. Between the lower\r\nedge of this snow line and the lower slopes of the mountain, there\r\nlies a zone of naked rock.\r\n\r\nAccording to Whymper, the eruption of Cotopaxi, in 1877, was preceded\r\nby an unusual degree of activity in the earlier parts of the year.\r\nThis, however, did not cause any alarm until June 25th, 1877, when,\r\nshortly after midday, an eruption, attended by tremendous subterranean\r\nroars, began, and an immense black column shot up into the air for\r\nabout twice the height of the cone. This eruption was clearly visible\r\nat Quito, for the wind blew the ashes towards the Pacific. At this\r\ntime the summit had not changed its appearance, but towards 6:30\r\nA. M., on the next day, another enormous column of ashes\r\nrose from the crater. The ashes and cinders were first carried due\r\nnorth by the winds, and then, spreading out in all directions, were\r\nsubsequently distributed through the air all over the country. At\r\nQuito, as early as 8 A. M., the sky assumed the appearance it\r\ngenerally has at twilight, and the darkness increased until midday,\r\nwhen it became as dark as at midnight. Indeed, it was so dark that one\r\ncould not see his hand before his face.\r\n\r\nDuring this eruption, as is very common in the eruptions of the\r\nsnow-clad mountains of South America, a flood of water, due to the\r\nrapid melting of the snow and ice on the summit, rushed down the\r\nmountain slopes at 10 o'clock A. M., on the 26th of the\r\nmonth, almost immediately after the appearance of a stream of lava\r\nthat began to flow down the mountain. In a few moments the mountain\r\nwas completely shut off from view by immense columns of steam and\r\nsmoke. At first, a low, moaning sound was heard, which rapidly\r\nincreased to a roar, when a deluge of mud, mingled with huge blocks of\r\nice and stones, swept down the mountain, leaving a desert in its path.\r\nIt is estimated that at some places this stream moved with a velocity\r\nof fifty miles per hour.\r\n\r\nThe general appearance of Cotopaxi is shown in the accompanying\r\nreproduction from the painting by Frederick E. Church in the Lenox\r\nLibrary, New York.\r\n\r\nAccording to Whymper, who made an ascent of Cotopaxi in 1880, the\r\ncrater on the summit has the form of an immense amphitheatre, 2,300\r\nfeet across from north to south, and 1,650 feet from east to west.\r\nIts crest is irregular and notched. The crater is surrounded by\r\nperpendicular cliffs. The western side of the volcano is irregular.\r\nBarometric measurements gave the height of this volcano at 19,498\r\nfeet. Its height as taken by La Condamine, during the early parts of\r\nthe last century, was 19,605 feet, so that, according to Whymper,\r\nassuming as would seem probable, that this difference in height has\r\nnot all been due to errors in measurements, the volcano has grown or\r\nincreased in height during the last century and a half.\r\n\r\nChimborazo, 20,498 feet, is another lofty mountain on the plateau of\r\nQuito. This volcano is situated in lat. 1° 30' S., and is not at the\r\npresent time in an active condition. It is, however, formed entirely\r\nof volcanic material. Its upper portions are covered with a layer of\r\nsnow to a level of some 2,600 feet below the summit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COTOPAXI _From a Painting by Frederick E.\r\nChurch in the Lenox Collection of the New York Public Library. By\r\nPermission_]\r\n\r\nChimborazo has an enormous volcanic summit, which, when seen from the\r\nPacific, when the air is especially clear after the long rains of\r\nwinter, is a most splendid sight. Whymper, who ascended the mountain,\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n      \"When the transparency of the air is increased and its\r\n      enormous circular summit is seen projected upon the deep\r\n      azure of blue of the Equatorial sky, it represents a\r\n      magnificent sight. The great rarity of the air through\r\n      which the top of the Andes is seen adds much to the\r\n      splendor.\"\r\n\r\nWhymper says, that as far as records are concerned, there have been no\r\neruptions of Chimborazo, which has apparently been an extinct volcano\r\nfor many years. Its crater has been completely buried by a thick cap\r\nof ice on its summit, while what lava streams exist on the mountain\r\nare either covered by large glaciers, or have been removed by erosion,\r\nor hidden by vegetation.\r\n\r\nChimborazo possesses less of the conical outline than Cotopaxi. There\r\nare steep cliffs towards the summit that have been named by Whymper\r\n\"the northern and southern walls.\" They seem to him to have been\r\nformed by the violent upheavals of the explosive eruptions that have\r\nblown away portions of the cone.\r\n\r\nThere are other volcanoes in this district, but the above are all we\r\nhave space for describing.\r\n\r\nAccording to Lyell, the volcano of Rancagua, in Chile, lat. 34° 15'\r\nS., is continually throwing up ashes and vapors like Stromboli.\r\nIndeed, a year seldom passes in Chile without some earthquake shocks.\r\nOf these shocks those which came from the side nearest the sea are\r\nmost violent. The town of Copiapo was laid waste by these shocks\r\nduring the years 1773, 1796, and 1819, in both instances after\r\nintervals of twenty-three years.\r\n\r\nSince the volcanic mountains of South America are snow-covered the\r\noccurrences of volcanic eruptions are apt to be attended by great\r\nfloods caused by the rapid melting of the snow, as well as sometimes\r\nby the breaking of huge subterranean cavities that are filled with\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nAccording to Lyell, the volcanoes of Peru rise from a plateau from\r\n17,000 to 20,000 feet above the sea. One of the principal volcanoes\r\nof Peru is Arequipa, whose summit is 18,877 feet above the level of\r\nthe sea. The mountain takes its name from the city of Arequipa, which\r\nis situated not far from its base. It is an active volcano. Another\r\nvolcano, Viejo, is found in lat. 16° 55' S.\r\n\r\nAccording to Lyell, there are active vents extending through Chile to\r\nthe island of Chiloe to lat. 30° N.\r\n\r\nAconcagua, west of Valparaiso, in lat. 32° 39' S., 23,000 feet in\r\nheight, the highest mountain in South America, is still in an active\r\ncondition. According to Scrope, when the city of Mendoza was destroyed\r\nby an earthquake, that killed 10,000 people, in March, 1861, it is\r\nprobable that Aconcagua was in eruption.\r\n\r\nThere are many other active volcanoes in Chile, extending as far south\r\nas the volcanoes of Patagonia, north of the Straits of Magellan as\r\nwell as others of Tierra del Fuego.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nVOLCANOES OF THE UNITED STATES\r\n\r\n\r\nFor some readers this may be a surprising chapter heading, for it is a\r\ngeneral impression that there are no volcanoes in the United States.\r\nIt is true that practically all of the volcanoes of this country are\r\ndormant or extinct. They have, however, at one time been exceedingly\r\nactive, and, if reports are correct, some of them were active during\r\ncomparatively recent times.\r\n\r\nNearly all of the volcanoes of the United States lie west of the\r\nmeridian of Denver. These volcanoes belong to two distinct types,\r\neither the Vesuvian type with built up cones, or the plateau or\r\nfissure type already referred to.\r\n\r\nThe following brief description of the volcanoes of the United States\r\nhas been collated, for the greater part, from Wallace's excellent book\r\non the volcanoes of North America.\r\n\r\nCrossing the United States on the Southern Pacific Railroad one's\r\nattention is caught, in Arizona, by a magnificent group of mountains\r\nknown as the San Francisco Mountains. The highest peak of these\r\nmountains reaches 12,562 feet above the level of the sea, and 5,700\r\nfeet above the surface of the plateau on which the mountains stand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18. THE UNITED STATES]\r\n\r\nAccording to G. K. Gilbert, the San Francisco Mountain group is formed\r\nof a variety of lava known as trachyte, that is of comparatively\r\nrecent ejection, possibly of a geological age called the Tertiary. The\r\nlava forming the mountains escaped through a number of crater cones,\r\nsome of which can still be seen in the neighborhood. Some of these\r\ncraters are now in almost as perfect a condition as the day they were\r\nformed. Indeed, to one looking at them from a neighboring elevation,\r\nthey appear so fresh, and so little affected by the climate, that one\r\nmight almost believe that the lava had just flowed out of the craters,\r\nand has not yet hardened. Nevertheless, geologists are sure they have\r\nbeen formed long before man appeared on the earth. In one of these\r\ncraters a lake of fresh water has collected.\r\n\r\nAnother extinct volcano of the United States is Mt. Taylor in New\r\nMexico, nearly east of the San Francisco Mountains. This mountain\r\nrises from the surface of a high table-land, or, as it is called\r\nin this part of the world, a _mesa_. The surface of the plateau is\r\ncovered with a thick lava stream from which Mt. Taylor rises to\r\na height of 11,390 feet above the level of the ocean. This mesa,\r\nor table-land, is forty-seven miles in length from northwest to\r\nsoutheast, and about twenty-three miles in breadth. Its general\r\nelevation is about 8,200 feet. The plateau rises about 2,000 feet\r\nabove the surface of the level land that surrounds it. All these\r\n2,000 feet have been removed by erosion. The table-land from which\r\nMt. Taylor rises has not been eroded by the action of the rain,\r\nrivers, and other weathering agencies like the surface of the country\r\nsurrounding it, because of a covering of lava that has been spread\r\nover its surface to a depth of about 300 feet.\r\n\r\nMt. Taylor is formed almost entirely of lava that has escaped through\r\na single opening and has built up a high cone around it. The volcano\r\nis now quite extinct, so that the original form of the mountain has\r\nbeen greatly changed by erosion.\r\n\r\nYou will remember, when we were discussing the general subject of\r\nvolcanoes, in the beginning of this book, that we spoke of volcanic\r\nmountains being bottled up after an eruption, by the hardening of\r\nthe lava which remained in the crater and the tube that connects the\r\ncrater with the place from which the lava had been derived. We then\r\nspoke of this hardened mass being known as a _volcanic plug_, or\r\nstopper, explaining how the volcano could never again erupt through\r\nits old crater unless it could develop sufficient force to blow out or\r\nremove this stopper.\r\n\r\nNow besides the crater at the top of Mt. Taylor there were several\r\nothers in the eroded region surrounding the mesa, or high table-land,\r\nfrom which Mt. Taylor rises. When, therefore, the erosion which\r\nremoved the 2,000 feet of rocks on all portions of the old mesa that\r\nwere not protected by the coating of lava, these old mountain plugs\r\nwere too hard to be worn away or eroded, and were, therefore, left\r\nprojecting into the air like vast pyramids.\r\n\r\nIf you should ever visit Mt. Taylor and should go to the eastern\r\nborder of this mesa, and look over the eroded plain, you would see in\r\nthe lowlands a part of the places from which the 2,000 feet of matter\r\nhave been slowly eroded. Dutton describes the beautiful panorama that\r\nis to be seen as follows:\r\n\r\n      \"The edge of the mesa suddenly descends by a succession of\r\n      ledges and slopes, nearly 2,000 feet into the rugged and\r\n      highly diversified valley-plain below. The country beneath\r\n      is a medley of low cliffs and bluffs, showing the browns\r\n      and pale yellows of the Cretaceous sandstones and shales.\r\n      Out of this confused patchwork of bright colors rise\r\n      several objects of remarkable aspect. They are apparently\r\n      inaccessible eyries of black rock, and at a rough guess, by\r\n      comparison with the known altitudes of surrounding objects,\r\n      their heights above the mean level of the adjoining plain\r\n      may range from 800 to 1,500 feet. The blackness of their\r\n      shade may be exaggerated by contrast with the brilliant\r\n      colors of the rocks and soil out of which they rise, but\r\n      their forms are even more striking.\"\r\n\r\nThese black piles are the _necks_ or lava plugs of extinct volcanoes.\r\nThey rise above the level of the plain because, being harder than\r\nthe surrounding rocks, they have resisted erosion. In some cases\r\nthese necks or plugs have been converted by shrinkage, on cooling,\r\ninto beautiful columns, somewhat of the type of the basaltic columns\r\nof the Giant's Causeway. It would be difficult to count the number\r\nof volcanic necks that can be seen near the edge of the mesa. One's\r\nattention is at once attracted to some dozen of these piles, which are\r\nespecially striking on account of their great size, and ominous black\r\ncolor, but the number is by no means limited to this dozen. There are\r\nhundreds of them.\r\n\r\nFig. 19 gives some idea of a part of the view from the edge of the\r\nmesa, and Fig. 20 the appearance of two of these volcanic necks.\r\n\r\nBut besides high volcanic mountains such as the San Francisco\r\nMountains and Mt. Taylor, there are, in different parts of the United\r\nStates, to be found fragments of huge craters from which, in the\r\ngeological past, immense quantities of lava have escaped. In some\r\ninstances these craters are but fragments of huge craters, that, like\r\nthe crater of Mt. Somma, in Vesuvius, have been nearly completely\r\nblown away by some unrecorded explosion during the far past.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19. PANORAMA FROM THE MESA AT THE EDGE OF MT.\r\nTAYLOR _From U. S. Geological Survey_]\r\n\r\nA crater of this type, known as Ice Springs Crater, is situated in the\r\ndesert valley west of the Wahsatch Mountains, some 125 miles south\r\nof Salt Lake City, Utah. This crater is especially interesting from\r\nthe fact that it occupies a position on a plain that was formed by\r\nthe deposition of sediment in an immense lake that covered this part\r\nof the United States very long before man lived on the earth. We\r\nare alluding to Lake Bonneville, a lake that existed in a geological\r\ntime known as the Glacial Epoch. This lake occupied the territory now\r\nfilled by the Great Salt Lake of Utah, but towards the close of the\r\nGlacial Epoch it was immensely larger than it is now. This can be\r\nshown not only by the presence of shore lines, that are clearly marked\r\non the sides of the surrounding mountains, but also by the ancient\r\nlake beaches, and deltas, that are common in the district, so that\r\ninstead of there being the comparatively limited area of Great Salt\r\nLake as marked on the maps of to-day there was a lake that had an area\r\nof 19,750 square miles, that covered an area on which at least 200,000\r\npeople dwell.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20. VOLCANIC NECKS, EDGE OF MESA AT MT.\r\nTAYLOR _From U. S. Geological Survey_]\r\n\r\nA similar lake, known as Lake Lehontan, existed at the same time,\r\ncovering large areas in the western parts of Nevada.\r\n\r\nComing now to Ice Springs Craters in Utah, we find here three small\r\ncraters formed of scoriæ and lapilli (volcanic ashes consisting of\r\nsmall angular stony fragments). Near them lies a fragment of a much\r\nlarger crater known as the Crescent. In some respects this crater was\r\nnot unlike the crater of Somma that surrounded Mt. Vesuvius. It was\r\nnot, however, as large, having a diameter of only 2,200 feet. From\r\nthese craters streams of basalt flowed until they covered considerable\r\nareas.\r\n\r\nA still more recent crater known as Tabernacle Crater is situated\r\nfour miles south of the Ice Springs Crater. Tabernacle Crater takes\r\nits name from the building known in Salt Lake City as the Tabernacle.\r\nAccording to Gilbert, this crater was formed at a time when Lake\r\nBonneville stood at a comparatively low level, or when the water was\r\nonly from fifty to seventy-five feet above the bottom of the valley\r\non which the crater now stands. At that time an explosive volcanic\r\neruption occurred on the bottom of the lake, and the rim of the\r\ncrater, built up by this explosion, was gradually pushed above the\r\nsurface of the lake, so as to shut out its waters.\r\n\r\nExtinct volcanic craters, not unlike those of Utah, occur also near\r\nRagtown, in Nevada, in a district known as the Carson Valley Desert,\r\nin one of the broadest areas of what was once Lake Lahontan. Ragtown\r\nis twenty-two miles southwest of Wadsworth on the Central Pacific\r\nRailroad. At the present time there are two circular depressions or\r\nvolcanic craters filled with pools of strongly alkaline water known\r\nas the Ragtown Pond, or Soda Lake. The large lake covers an area of\r\n268-1/2 acres. Its greatest diameter is over 4,000 feet. Without going\r\ninto a detailed description it will suffice to say that the larger\r\ncrater probably was destroyed by an explosive volcanic eruption.\r\n\r\nAnother intensely alkaline lake that fills an extinct volcanic crater\r\nis the Mono Lake, situated in Mono Valley in California at the eastern\r\nbase of the Sierra Nevadas. It has an area of about 200 square miles.\r\nThe centre of the lake has two small islands named Pacha and Negit.\r\nImmediately south of Mono Lake are a number of craters that occupy\r\nportions of what was once apparently a fissure extending in a general\r\nnorth and south direction. The highest of these craters are in the\r\nneighborhood of 2,500 feet.\r\n\r\nBut leaving these inconspicuous craters, let us briefly examine some\r\nof the higher mountain peaks of the United States that are of volcanic\r\norigin. One of the most conspicuous of these is Mt. Shasta. This\r\nmountain is situated in California, at the northern end of the Sierra\r\nNevadas. It has a height of 14,350 feet. It is a snow-clad mountain of\r\na conical form, and is a conspicuous object in the landscape, because\r\nit stands alone.\r\n\r\nMt. Shasta is a double-coned mountain. Besides the cone on its summit\r\nthere is a well-developed cone known as Shastina on the western side\r\nof the mountain, 2,000 feet lower than the main summit.\r\n\r\nThere are well-defined lava streams on the slopes of Mt. Shasta. One\r\nof these, which issued from the southern side of the mountain at\r\nan elevation of 5,500 feet, divided into two streams. One of these\r\nstreams is twelve miles in length. The other entered the canyon of the\r\nSacramento River, thus displacing the water.\r\n\r\nComing now to the Cascade Mountains, in Oregon and Washington, we\r\nwill find in them a number of giant peaks of volcanic origin. The\r\nmost important of these are in regular order from south to north, as\r\nfollows: Mt. Pitt, 9,760 feet; Mt. Mazana, 8,223; Mt. Union, 7,881;\r\nMt. Scott, 7,123; Three Sisters, Mt. Jefferson, 10,200, and Mt. Hood,\r\n11,225, in Oregon; Mt. Adams, 9,570; Mt. St. Helen's, 9,750; Mt.\r\nRainier, 14,525, and Mt. Baker in Washington, 10,877.\r\n\r\nNearly all these mountains have craters either on their summits or on\r\ntheir sides. They are extinct volcanic mountains, that were, for the\r\nmost part, thrown up during the Tertiary Geological Period, so that\r\nthey have all been greatly affected by erosion.\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable of the above volcanic mountains is Mt.\r\nMazana, in Oregon. This mountain has on its summit an approximately\r\ncircular cavity from five to six miles in diameter, that is occupied\r\nby a lake of water known as Crater Lake. This lake is 6,239 feet above\r\nthe level of the sea, and has a depth of 1,975 feet. It is surrounded\r\nby nearly vertical walls ranging from 900 to 2,200 feet deep, so that\r\nthe vast caldera of which this great depression consists has a depth\r\nof at least 4,000 feet.\r\n\r\nMt. Pitt, situated about sixty miles north of Mt. Shasta, in southern\r\nOregon, has a regularly shaped volcanic cone, and the remnant of a\r\ncrater at its summit. The Three Sisters and Mt. Jefferson lie to\r\nthe north of Mt. Pitt. Like the others they are ancient volcanic\r\nmountains. But little is accurately known concerning them.\r\n\r\nMt. Hood, 11,225 feet high, rises from the crest of the Cascade\r\nrange in Northwest Oregon, about twenty-five miles south of the\r\nColumbia River. Mt. Hood is an exceedingly majestic mountain. At its\r\nsummit there are only portions of the walls of the original crater.\r\nWhen ascended in 1888, streams of sulphur vapor were escaping from\r\nfumaroles on its northeastern slopes, at an elevation of 8,500 feet\r\nabove the sea.\r\n\r\nMt. Adams and Mt. St. Helen's lie to the north of Mt. Hood. Mt. Adams\r\nabout sixty miles to the north, and beyond this, Mt. St. Helen's.\r\nAccurate information concerning the summit of Mt. Adams is still\r\nlacking. Mt. St. Helen's in Washington has more of a conical summit.\r\nRussell states that according to frontiersmen, St. Helen's has been\r\nin a state of activity within the past fifty years. A French-Canadian\r\nasserts that the mountain was in actual eruption during the winter of\r\n1841-43, that at this date the light from the volcano was sufficiently\r\nbright to enable one to see and pick up a pin in the grass at midnight\r\nnear his cabin some twenty miles distant. Mt. St. Helen's was ascended\r\nin 1889, when fumaroles were found on the northeast side.\r\n\r\nMt. Rainier in Washington is plainly visible from Puget Sound. It is\r\na most magnificent mountain. The summit has a bowl-shaped crater, of\r\nan almost perfectly circular form. The inside of the crater, when\r\nlast ascended, was filled to within thirty or thirty-five feet of its\r\nrim with ice and snow. There was, however, evidences of heat, since\r\nnumerous jets of steam were seen issuing from its interior rim.\r\n\r\nMt. Baker, Washington, is the northernmost of the volcanoes of the\r\nCascade Mountains, south of the boundary line between the United\r\nStates and Canada. But little is known of this mountain. The summit\r\nappears as a conical peak from Puget Sound, so that its form would\r\nseem to show that it is of volcanic origin. According to Gibbs,\r\nofficers of the Hudson Bay Company, as well as the Indians, declared\r\nthat Mt. Baker was in eruption in 1843, when it broke out at the same\r\ntime as Mt. St. Helen's, covering the country with ashes.\r\n\r\nThere are but few volcanoes in the Rocky Mountains which extend from\r\nnorth to south through the United States at a considerable distance to\r\nthe east of the Sierra Nevadas and Cascade Ranges. The Spanish Peaks,\r\nsituated in the southeastern part of Colorado about sixty miles south\r\nof Pueblo, are the remains of ancient volcanoes. Two of the most\r\nprominent of these peaks rise from 12,720 to 13,620 feet above the sea.\r\n\r\nWe shall make no effort to attempt to describe the volcanic mountains\r\nthat may exist in those portions of the Rocky Mountain Ranges or the\r\nCascade Range lying in Canada. Comparatively little is known of them,\r\nbut inasmuch as volcanic activity has been manifested in Alaska, it\r\nwould seem highly improbable, as Russell remarks, that volcanoes\r\nshould suddenly cease at the northern boundaries of the United States\r\nand then begin again at the most southern part of Alaska. It will be\r\nsufficient to say that Mt. Edgecome, situated on an island in the\r\nneighborhood of Sitka, is of volcanic origin, and that the Aleutian\r\nIslands, beginning at Alaska on the east at the head of Cook's Inlet,\r\nextend westward through the Peninsula of Alaska to the Peninsula of\r\nKamtschatka for a distance of nearly 1,600 miles. This belt, which\r\nis called by Russell \"the Aleutian Volcanic Belt,\" contains numerous\r\nvolcanoes that are known to have been active in historical times.\r\n\r\nMt. Wrangell, on the Copper River, 200 miles northeast of the head\r\nof Cook's Inlet, is a lofty volcanic mountain that is said to have\r\nbeen in eruption in 1819, and at the time of last report was still\r\nthrowing out columns of steam. While much remains to be ascertained\r\nabout the volcanoes of the Aleutian Islands, it would appear that\r\nthere are active volcanoes on twenty-five of these islands, on which\r\nsome forty-eight craters have been found. Eruptions are common in the\r\ndistrict.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE CATASTROPHE OF MARTINIQUE AND THE VOLCANIC ISLANDS OF THE LESSER\r\nANTILLES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe West Indies Island chain consists of two groups of islands; i. e.,\r\nthe Greater Antilles, including Cuba, Jamaica, Hayti, and Porto Rico,\r\non the west, and the chain of the Lesser Antilles on the east.\r\n\r\nThe Lesser Antilles consists of two parallel chains, the westernmost\r\nof which is for the greater part mountainous with peaks several\r\nthousand feet in height. All these islands are volcanic. The chain\r\non the east consists of low, calcareous rocks, or rocks consisting\r\nlargely of lime.\r\n\r\nIn the western chain the islands beginning on the south are, Grenada,\r\nSt. Vincent, St. Lucia, Martinique, Dominica, Guadeloupe, Montserrat,\r\nNevis, and St. Eustace, while in the calcareous chain are found the\r\nTobago, Barbadoes, and others.\r\n\r\nPrior to 1902, the greatest volcanic eruption in this part of the\r\nworld occurred on the island of St. Vincent, with the volcano of\r\nSoufrière. Although the forces displayed were exceedingly great, yet\r\nthey become insignificant when compared with the appalling eruption\r\nthat took place in Martinique only a short time ago; namely, May the\r\n8th, 1902, when the volcano of Mt. Pelée, situated on the northwestern\r\npart of the island, burst into an eruption so terrible that in\r\ndestruction of life it far exceeded the eruption of Krakatoa, although\r\nthe amount of energy causing the eruption was much smaller.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21. THE LESSER ANTILLES]\r\n\r\nHeilprin, in a book called \"Mt. Pelée and the Tragedy of Martinique,\"\r\nfrom whom most of the information of this chapter has been obtained,\r\ncalls attention to the fact that before the eruption of Pelée there\r\nwere plenty of warnings for those intelligent enough to note them. For\r\ntwo or three weeks prior to May 8th, 1902, the volcanic activity of\r\nPelée had been rapidly increasing, the mountain throwing out clouds\r\nof ashes and sulphurous vapors from its crater. By April 25th the\r\nsulphurous vapors had so increased in quantity as to make breathing\r\ndifficult in St. Pierre. The ashes fell on the surrounding country and\r\nby the 2d of May had so covered the streets of St. Pierre as to stop\r\ntraffic.\r\n\r\nThree days later, May 6th, shortly before noon, an avalanche of mud\r\npoured down the slopes of the mountain with the rapidity of an express\r\ntrain. These torrents of mud and water deluged the towns and villages\r\nin the neighborhood. The activity of Mt. Pelée increased until the\r\nmorning of May 8th, 1902, when, almost at exactly 8 A. M., an\r\neruption occurred, so terrible in its effects that in two minutes the\r\ncity of St. Pierre was almost completely destroyed.\r\n\r\nSt. Pierre, the principal town of Martinique, is situated on the\r\nisland of Martinique, on the northwestern coast, about ten miles\r\nsouthwest of Mt. Pelée. St. Pierre was settled as far back as 1635. It\r\nis situated on an open roadstead without any harbor.\r\n\r\nThat there were many points of resemblance between the position of St.\r\nPierre and the destroyed city of Pompeii will be recognized as the\r\ndescription of the catastrophe is given.\r\n\r\nSt. Pierre was a beautiful city, and formed the natural outlet to one\r\nof the richest districts in Martinique for the production of sugar\r\ncane and cocoa. It contained many fine houses, the homes of planters,\r\nwealthy bankers, merchants, and shippers, who, besides their regular\r\nhouses in the city, had constructed handsome villas on heights on the\r\noutskirts of the city. The houses were to a great extent one or two\r\nstories in height, and were in many cases surrounded by fine gardens.\r\nThe city extended along the coast for about two miles. The streets\r\nwere well lighted.\r\n\r\nThe eruption of Mt. Pelée on May 8th, 1902, was of a very unusual\r\ncharacter, containing a feature that--with the exception of a volcanic\r\neruption of Soufrière, a volcanic mountain on the neighboring island\r\nof St. Vincent, and an eruption of Kilauea in Hawaii--so far as I am\r\naware, never before occurred. This was a blast of highly heated air,\r\nmingled with white hot or incandescent dust, that swept down the side\r\nof the mountain with a velocity of one or two miles per minute, or\r\npossibly more.\r\n\r\nNearly all of the people in St. Pierre were killed. From the\r\nappearance of the bodies it seemed that death was practically\r\ninstantaneous, and was due either to scorching or burning, or\r\nasphyxiation by the breathing of highly heated air. The number of\r\npeople so killed, including almost the entire population of St.\r\nPierre, as well as a number of adjoining settlements, was not less\r\nthan 30,000.\r\n\r\nThe zone of absolute destruction was limited to an area the extent\r\nof which did not greatly exceed eight or nine square miles. On the\r\noutskirts of this zone the destruction, though considerable, was less\r\ncomplete.\r\n\r\nThere was almost an entire absence of great earthquake shocks during\r\nthe eruption.\r\n\r\nFollowing the terrible eruption of May 8th were a number of less\r\nviolent eruptions on May 20th, 26th, June 6th, July 9th, and August\r\n31st. According to Heilprin these eruptions were of the same character\r\nas that of May 8th.\r\n\r\nThere has been considerable discussion as to the exact causes of the\r\ntornadic incandescent blast that caused the awful destruction of life.\r\nWithout entering this discussion it is sufficient to say that it is\r\nnow generally considered that the blast consisted of highly heated\r\nair, and super-heated steam loaded with great quantities of finely\r\ndivided red hot or even white hot dust particles.\r\n\r\nWhile, perhaps, the force producing the awful eruption of Mt. Pelée\r\nwas greatly excelled in the case of many other volcanic eruptions;\r\nsuch as Papandayang, in 1772; Asamayama, in 1783; Skaptar Jökul, in\r\n1783; Tomboro, in 1815; Coseguina, in 1835; and Krakatoa, in 1883;\r\nyet, in the words of Heilprin, \"in intensity and swiftness of its\r\ndeath-dealing blast ... the eruption of May 8th, and of later dates,\r\nstands unique in records of volcanic manifestations.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the amount of ashes that accompanied the blast of white hot\r\nsteam and air was comparatively small, yet during the time between\r\nthis and the subsequent eruptions, the amount of ashes that were\r\nthrown from the surface of Mt. Pelée was exceedingly great.\r\n\r\nAccording to Russell, in a paper on the volcanic eruptions of\r\nMartinique and St. Vincent, in 1902, the amount of ashes and solid\r\nmatter generally thrown out from the crater of Mt. Pelée would be\r\nequal to 40,000,000 cubic feet every minute, or one and a half times\r\nthe sediments discharged by the Mississippi in the course of a whole\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nAccording to Heilprin, however, the actual amount of dust thrown from\r\nthe crater of Mt. Pelée was, probably, 500 times greater than the\r\namount discharged by the Mississippi River in the course of a year,\r\nand, consequently, considerably greater than that of all the rivers of\r\nthe world combined, or, as he says:\r\n\r\n      \"Mont Pelée has now been in a condition of forceful\r\n      activity for upwards of two hundred days; can we assume\r\n      that during this time it may have thrown out a mass of\r\n      material whose cubical contents are hardly less than\r\n      a quarter of the area of Martinique as it now appears\r\n      above the waters? One is, indeed, almost appalled by the\r\n      magnitude of this work, and yet the work may even be very\r\n      much greater than is here stated. We ask ourselves the\r\n      questions, what becomes of the void that is being formed in\r\n      the interior? What form of new catastrophe does it invite?\r\n      There can be no answer to a question of this kind--except\r\n      in the future happening that may be associated with this\r\n      special condition. But geologists must take count of the\r\n      force as being one of greatest potential energy, whose\r\n      relation to the modelling and the shaping of the destinies\r\n      of the globe is of far greater significance than has\r\n      generally been conceived.\"\r\n\r\nA curious circumstance connected with the eruption of Mt. Pelée was\r\nthe most pronounced electric and magnetic disturbances. Moreover, as\r\nin the case of the eruption of Krakatoa, there were the same after\r\nglows or red sunsets and sunrises due to the presence of fine volcanic\r\ndust in the higher regions of the air. These phenomena were observed\r\nover widely separated areas.\r\n\r\nIt appears that this great eruption in Martinique was preceded by\r\nsevere earthquakes in the northern part of South America, especially\r\nin Colombia and Venezuela. The most marked was the great earthquake\r\nwhich on April 18th destroyed the city of Guatamaula; this was,\r\nperhaps, the most destructive earthquake that has occurred in the\r\nWestern Hemisphere since the great earthquake of 1812, that destroyed\r\nthe city of Caracas. Indeed, Professor Milne suggests that it was this\r\nearthquake that brought about the eruption of Mt. Pelée.\r\n\r\nSoufrière, on the island of St. Vincent, had a great eruption on May\r\n7th, 1902, one day before the awful eruption of Mt. Pelée. No lava\r\nflowed during this eruption. There were, however, great discharges\r\nof mud, due to a lake that before the eruption filled the top of\r\na depression known as the old crater which lay southwest of a new\r\ncrater, or the crater that was formed during the eruption of 1812. The\r\nold crater was nine-tenths of a mile across from east to west, and\r\neight-tenths of a mile from north to south. The depth to the crater\r\nfloor was from 1,000 to 2,400 feet. The surface of the new and shallow\r\nboiling lake which occupied the deepest part of the floor during the\r\nlatter part of May, and from June to August, was estimated to be\r\nonly 1,200 feet above the level of the sea. The sheet of water that\r\noccupied it before the eruption being several hundred feet higher.\r\n\r\nSoufrière did not fail to give warnings of its coming eruption.\r\nRumblings were heard two days before the explosion. On May 5th, 1902,\r\nfishermen who crossed the lake noticed that the water was disturbed\r\nand agitated. On the Tuesday following, May 6th, great clouds were\r\nthrown out during the afternoon, and the volcano was illumined by a\r\nreddish glare of fire. The first explosion was heard shortly before\r\ntwo o'clock on the following day and the volcano burst into activity.\r\nThe explosions, together with great discharges of pumice, ashes, and\r\nboulders, followed one another rapidly. A column of steam was shot up\r\ninto the air for a height of 30,000 feet. The severest paroxysm came\r\nshortly after ten A. M., and was succeeded by others nearly\r\nas violent during the next few hours. By this time a reddish curtain\r\nof clouds nearly shut out the island from view, and rapidly advanced\r\nover the land and descended on the sea. This eruption caused a loss of\r\nlife of about 1,350.\r\n\r\nThis eruption of Mt. Soufrière was accompanied by the same tornadic\r\nblast of glowing air. There was not, however, any single blast quite\r\nas severe as that which attended the eruption of Pelée on May 8th,\r\n1902.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nSOME OTHER NOTED VOLCANIC MOUNTAINS\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the limits of our book will prevent any further description\r\nof volcanic districts or regions, we must content ourselves with\r\ndescriptions of some of the noted of the remaining volcanoes, although\r\nmany we will thus omit contain great wonders.\r\n\r\nAs we have already seen from the description of Krakatoa, the island\r\nof Java near which Krakatoa is situated is especially noted not only\r\nfor the great number of its volcanic mountains, but also for the\r\nfrequency and severity of their eruptions.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most destructive eruption of any of the volcanic mountains\r\nof Java was of a volcanic mountain called Papandayang. This volcano,\r\nsituated on the southern coast of the island, is 7,034 feet in\r\nheight, and was in eruption in 1772. According to Scrope, from whom\r\nthe details of this eruption have been obtained, two others of the\r\nmany volcanoes on Java, situated at 184 and 352 geographical miles\r\nrespectively from Papandayang, broke out at the same time into active\r\neruption, although several intervening cones were undisturbed.\r\n\r\nThe eruption of Papandayang was of the explosive type, a large part\r\nof the mountain being broken off by the great force of the eruption,\r\nand its materials scattered far and wide over the surrounding country.\r\nDuring this eruption forty villages with their inhabitants were\r\nburied by great showers of ashes. An area of fifteen by six miles was\r\nleft in the shape of a huge pit by the great eruption. It was at\r\nfirst believed by some that this pit was due to the actual sinking\r\nin of the ground, but a more careful study has shown that it was in\r\nreality caused by the great force of the eruption, being, in point\r\nof fact, a vast explosive crater that was formed by the expulsion of\r\nthe materials that formerly filled it. Some idea of the great extent\r\nof this eruption of Papandayang may be had by the size of this huge\r\ncrater that was six by fifteen miles in diameter.\r\n\r\nAnother great volcanic mountain in Java that had a terrific eruption\r\nwas Galungoon, or Galung Gung. According to Lyell, from whom the facts\r\nof this eruption have been obtained, prior to this eruption the slopes\r\nof the mountain were highly cultivated and densely populated. There\r\nwas a circular pit or crater on the summit of the mountain, but there\r\nhad been no traditions of any eruptions prior to 1822.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1822, the waters of the Kunir River, one of the small rivers\r\nthat flow down the slopes of the mountain, were observed to become\r\nhot and turbid. On the 8th of October, 1822, a terrific explosion was\r\nsuddenly heard, accompanied by great earthquake shocks, when immense\r\ncolumns of hot water and boiling mud, mixed with burning brimstone,\r\nashes, and lapilli, were thrown violently like a great waterspout from\r\nthe opening in the mountain, with such enormous violence that great\r\nquantities fell across the River Tandoi, forty miles distant, while\r\nthe valleys in the neighborhood were filled with a burning torrent.\r\nThe rivers overflowed their banks and produced great destruction by\r\nfloods of burning and boiling materials that washed away all the\r\nvillages and cultivated fields in their path. During this eruption an\r\nextended area was covered with boiling mud in which were completely\r\nburied the bodies of many of those who perished.\r\n\r\nSo great was the violence with which the boiling mud, cinders, etc.,\r\nwere thrown out of the mountain that they entirely failed to fall on\r\nmany of the villages in the immediate neighborhood, while the more\r\nremote villages were completely destroyed and buried out of sight\r\nunder the mud.\r\n\r\nThe first eruption continued for nearly five hours. During several\r\ndays following the eruption, torrents of rain fell, which produced\r\nfloods in the rivers that covered the country far and wide with thick\r\nlayers of mud.\r\n\r\nFour days after the great eruption, that is, on the 12th of October,\r\n1822, a second and still more violent eruption occurred, when immense\r\nquantities of hot mud were again thrown out of the crater. Great\r\nblocks of hardened lava called basalt were thrown a distance of seven\r\nmiles from the volcano. This eruption was accompanied by a violent\r\nearthquake. It was during this eruption that a huge piece of the side\r\nof the cone was blown out, not unlike the case of the Val del Bove on\r\nMt. Etna. The surrounding country was covered with mud. The immense\r\nquantity of materials thus thrown out of the side of the mountain\r\nproduced changes in the courses of several rivers, thus causing great\r\nfloods which in the single night of October 12th drowned 2,000 people.\r\nDuring these eruptions there were 114 villages destroyed, with a total\r\nloss of life of about 4,000.\r\n\r\nThere is a volcanic mountain on the island of Sumbawa that is noted\r\nfor the very destructive eruption that occurred on it in April, 1815.\r\nIf you examine the map of the Sunda Islands chain, you will see that\r\nthe island of Sumbawa lies immediately east of a little island called\r\nLombock, about 200 miles east of Java.\r\n\r\nThis eruption of Sumbawa was of the most frightful violence, and,\r\nindeed, with the exception of Krakatoa and Pelée, was one of the\r\ngreatest eruptions in historic times.\r\n\r\nLike all great eruptions, that of Sumbawa gave plenty of signs of\r\nits coming. During April, 1814, the volcano manifested considerable\r\nincrease in its activity, and ashes fell on the decks of vessels\r\nsailing past the island.\r\n\r\nThe eruption began on April 5th, 1815, but reached its greatest\r\nviolence on the 11th and 12th of April. According to Lyell, the sound\r\nof the explosion was heard at the island of Sumatra at a distance of\r\n970 geographical miles towards the west, and in the opposite direction\r\nit was heard for a distance of 720 miles. The destruction of life was\r\nterrible. Out of a population of 12,000 in the province of Tomboro,\r\nonly twenty-six people escaped with their lives.\r\n\r\nLike many other great eruptions the shooting upwards of the great\r\ncolumn of matter from the crater produced a violent whirlwind that\r\ncarried people, horses, cattle, and almost every movable object high\r\ninto the air, and tore up huge trees by their roots.\r\n\r\nImmense quantities of ashes fell over the surrounding country, or were\r\ncarried towards Java to the west a distance of 300 miles, while on the\r\nnorth they were carried towards Celebes for a distance of 217 miles.\r\nCinders covered the ocean towards the west two feet thick and several\r\nmiles in length, so that ships could hardly make their way through\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe darkness in Java produced by the dense ash cloud was greater than\r\nhad ever before been experienced with the single exception of the\r\ngreat eruption of Krakatoa. A considerable quantity of this volcanic\r\ndust was carried to the islands of Amboyna and Banda, the last named\r\nisland being at a distance of 800 miles east of the volcano.\r\n\r\nThis eruption of Sumbawa was attended by great lava streams that\r\ncovered vast areas of the land and afterwards poured into the sea.\r\n\r\nAs in the case of the explosive eruption of Krakatoa great waves were\r\nproduced in the ocean all along the coasts of Sumbawa, and surrounding\r\nislands. The sea suddenly rose from two to twelve feet. A great wave\r\nrushed up the mouths of the rivers, and at the town of Tomboro, on\r\nthe west side of Sumbawa, an area of land was sunk in the waters and\r\nremained permanently covered by eighteen feet of water.\r\n\r\nThe most important of the still active volcanoes of Japan is\r\nAssamayna. This mountain was in terrible eruption during the autumn of\r\n1783, when dense showers of ashes thrown out of the crater darkened\r\nthe sky, turning the day into night, and, falling on the cultivated\r\nfields around the mountain, changed them into deserts. During the\r\neruption some forty-eight villages were destroyed by showers of ashes\r\nand red hot stones and thousands of the inhabitants were either killed\r\ndirectly by the stones and ashes, or died from starvation, since their\r\nfields were covered with ashes for miles around to a depth of from two\r\nand a half to five feet.\r\n\r\nAnother terrible eruption in Japan was in the volcanic mountain of\r\nWunzen, or Onzen-Gatake. This occurred during 1791-93. During the last\r\neruption of this volcano, 53,000 people lost their lives, either by\r\nreason of the eruption of the volcano, or by huge waves set up in the\r\nocean by an earthquake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nJORULLO, A YOUNG VOLCANIC MOUNTAIN\r\n\r\n\r\nYou must not suppose that when we speak of Jorullo as a young volcanic\r\nmountain that we mean young in the sense that you or I might be called\r\nyoung, but young as regards mountains; for Jorullo, now a great\r\nmountain range, had no existence before the year 1759, and that would\r\nmake the mountain a little less than 150 years old, which so far as\r\nmountains are concerned may properly be regarded as quite young.\r\n\r\nThe story of Jorullo is very interesting, and affords an excellent\r\nexample of the great scale on which modern volcanic eruptions take\r\nplace during historical times.\r\n\r\nIf you examine the map of Mexico on page 86 you will see that Jorullo\r\nlies 170 miles southwest of the city of Mexico, and 108 miles from the\r\nPacific Ocean, which is the nearest large body of water. This mountain\r\nis of especial interest because, if old traditions are to be believed,\r\nit was thrown up during practically a single night. This wonderful\r\nevent took place on an elevated plain or plateau, called the Plain of\r\nMalpais, that lies between 2,000 and 3,000 feet above the level of the\r\nocean. The plain was situated in a part of Mexico that was celebrated\r\nfor the growth of the finest cotton and indigo in the world. It\r\nformed the large estate of a wealthy planter, Señor Pedro de Jorullo,\r\nwho lived at his ease as a wealthy planter is apt to do in tropical\r\ncountries like Mexico.\r\n\r\nJorullo's plantation was covered by an especially fertile soil, since\r\nit was formed by the deposits of volcanic ashes, dust, tufa, etc.,\r\nproduced, most probably, by neighboring volcanoes long before man\r\nappeared on the earth, for the plain of Malpais was bounded by hills\r\nthat were composed of volcanic materials. There had, however, been no\r\nsigns of volcanic activity in the neighborhood. It had indeed been\r\nquiet, so far as volcanic eruptions were concerned, since the time of\r\nthe discovery of America by Columbus, until the middle of the last\r\ncentury. The fertile fields of the Jorullo plantation were watered by\r\ntwo rivers, or as we would probably call them, brooks, the Cuitamba\r\nand the San Pedro.\r\n\r\nSigns were not wanting of the coming calamity. During June, 1759,\r\nsubterranean sounds were heard of a low rumbling character, which\r\nevery now and then increased until they resembled in intensity the\r\nsounds produced by the firing of large guns. These sounds were\r\naccompanied by earthquake shocks that greatly terrified the people\r\nand caused them to flee from their homes. Nothing, however, occurred,\r\nso, becoming accustomed to the noises, the people returned to their\r\nhouses. The noises and tremblings ceased for over two months, until,\r\non the 29th of September, 1759, they were again heard, and a terrible\r\neruption began. A long fissure opened in the earth, extending\r\ngenerally from northeast to southwest. From this fissure flames\r\nburst out, fragments of burning rock and stone, together with large\r\nquantities of ashes were thrown to great heights in the air, and were\r\nfollowed by streams of molten rock. Six volcanic cones were formed\r\nalong the fissure. The highest of these cones is what now constitutes\r\nthe volcanic mountain of Jorullo, which then reached a height of at\r\nleast 1,600 feet above the level of the plain. From its cone were\r\nthrown out great quantities of lava of the same type as that which\r\nescaped from the craters of many volcanic islands such as Hawaii and\r\nIceland, namely, basaltic lavas. This eruption, which began on the\r\n29th of September, 1759, continued until the month of February, 1760.\r\n\r\nThe account as above given was obtained by Humboldt, who visited the\r\ncountry some fifty-six years after the eruption. This story was told\r\nhim by the Indians, but was also recorded in verse by a Jesuit priest,\r\nRaphael Landiva, a native of Guatemala. According to the account given\r\nHumboldt by the Indians, it appears that when a long time after the\r\neruptions had quieted down, they had returned to their old homes with\r\nthe hope of cultivating part of the grounds, they found the plains\r\nstill too hot to permit their living on them.\r\n\r\nAccording to Lyell, there was around the base of the cone, spreading\r\nfrom them as a centre over an area of some four square miles, a convex\r\nmass, about 550 feet in height, most of the surface of which was\r\ncovered with thousands of small flattish conical mounds from six to\r\nnine feet in height. These, together with numerous large fissures that\r\ncrossed the plain in different directions, served as points for the\r\nescape of sulphur vapors, as well as for the vapors of hot water.\r\n\r\nDuring the escape of lava from the craters in 1759, the molten rock,\r\nspreading over the plain, ran into the channels of the river or brooks\r\nbefore named, driving out the water. This water reappeared at the base\r\nof the mountain in numerous hot springs.\r\n\r\nHumboldt thought that the conical mountains had been lifted or raised\r\nby the formation of huge bubbles formed under the lava, thus causing\r\nit to assume a shape not unlike that of a huge bladder. This opinion,\r\nhowever, has not been accepted by geologists at the present time.\r\nScrope points out that this was probably the origin of the little\r\nconical mounds that covered the surface of the principal conical\r\nmounds but was not, in all probability, the cause of the mound itself.\r\nHe says:\r\n\r\n      \"With regard to the disputed question as to the origin\r\n      of the raised plain of the Malpais, M. de Saussure, the\r\n      last and most trustworthy visitor, entirely confirms the\r\n      opinion which I ventured to proclaim in 1825, that Humboldt\r\n      was mistaken in supposing it to have been 'blown up from\r\n      beneath like a bladder,' and that it is merely an ordinary\r\n      current of lava, which, owing to its very imperfect\r\n      liquidity at the time of its issue from the volcanic vent,\r\n      as well as to the overflow of one sheet or stream upon\r\n      another, had acquired great thickness about its source,\r\n      gradually thinning off towards the outer limit of the\r\n      elliptical area it covered.\"\r\n\r\nIf you have been able to follow the above you will see that Mr. Scrope\r\nmeans that in his opinion the cone of Jorullo is a lava cone like\r\nthat we have already studied on Mt. Loa or Mt. Kilauea, or, in other\r\nwords, that the lava as it came out from the opening on the top of\r\nJorullo, flowed in all directions around the opening, thus building up\r\na mountain in the form of a flat lava cone.\r\n\r\nPerhaps one of the reasons Humboldt had for believing the entire\r\nelevation of Jorullo to be due to the formation of a huge bladder was\r\nthe fact that the plain on which the cone is situated, when struck,\r\ngave out a sound as though there was a vast hollow space below it.\r\nThis was especially the case when the hoofs of the horses driven over\r\nits surface produced sounds as though they were moving over the summit\r\nof a hollow dome-like space below. But, as Lyell points out, this was\r\nprobably only due to the fact that the materials forming the cone were\r\nvery light and porous.\r\n\r\nAccording to Burkhardt, a German mining engineer who visited Jorullo\r\nin 1827, there appears to have been no other eruptions of the volcano\r\nsince the time of Humboldt's visit. Mr. Burkhardt descended to the\r\nbottom of the crater and observed that small quantities of sulphurous\r\nvapors were still escaping. The small cones or _hornitos_, however, on\r\nthe slopes had entirely ceased emitting steam. It appeared, too, that\r\nthe twenty-four years that had passed since the time of Humboldt's\r\nvisit, the rich soil of the surrounding country had permitted the\r\nsuccessful cultivation of some crops of sugar cane and indigo.\r\n\r\nRussell appears to doubt the reliability of the information obtained\r\nby Humboldt concerning Jorullo. He suggests that a poetical account\r\nby the Jesuit missionary from whom Humboldt obtained much of his\r\ninformation was not apt to possess marked scientific accuracy. While,\r\nhowever, this may be true, yet to a certain extent it seems entirely\r\nprobable that the principal facts were as above given. The following\r\naccount as given by Humboldt, is taken from a translation made in the\r\nearly part of 1800:\r\n\r\n      \"The affrighted inhabitants fled to the mountains of\r\n      Aguasarco. A tract of ground from three to four square\r\n      miles in extent, which goes by the name of Malpays, rose up\r\n      in the shape of a bladder. The bounds of this convulsion\r\n      are still distinguishable in the fractural strata. The\r\n      Malpays, near its edge, is only twelve metres above the\r\n      old level of the plain called the Playas de Jorullo; but\r\n      the convexity of the ground thus thrown up increases\r\n      progressively towards the centre, to an elevation of 160\r\n      metres (524.8 ft.).\r\n\r\n      \"Those who witnessed this catastrophe from the top of\r\n      Aguasarco assert that flames were seen to issue forth\r\n      for an extent of more than half a square league, that\r\n      fragments of burning rocks were thrown up to prodigious\r\n      heights, and that through a thick cloud of ashes,\r\n      illuminated by the volcanic fire, the softened surface\r\n      of the earth was seen to swell up like an agitated\r\n      sea. The rivers of Cuitamba and San Pedro precipitated\r\n      themselves into the burning chasms. The decomposition of\r\n      the water contributed to invigorate the flames, which were\r\n      distinguishable at the city of Pascuaro, though situated on\r\n      very extensive table-land 1,400 metres (4,592 ft.) elevated\r\n      above the plains of Las Playas de Jorullo. Eruptions of\r\n      mud, and especially of strata of clay enveloping balls\r\n      of decomposed basalt in concentrical layers, appeared to\r\n      indicate that subterranean water had no small share in\r\n      producing this extraordinary revolution. Thousands of small\r\n      cones, from two to three metres in height, called by the\r\n      indigenes ovens, issued forth from the Malpays....\r\n\r\n      \"In the midst of the ovens, six large masses, elevated from\r\n      400 to 500 metres each above the old level of the plain,\r\n      sprung up from a chasm, of which the direction is from\r\n      N. N. E. to the S. S. E. This is the phenomenon of the\r\n      Montenovo of Naples, several times repeated in a range of\r\n      volcanic hills. The most elevated of these enormous masses,\r\n      which bears some resemblance to the puys de l'Auvergne, is\r\n      the great Volcan de Jorullo. It is continually burning,\r\n      and has thrown up from the north side an immense quantity\r\n      of scorified and basaltic lavas containing fragments of\r\n      primitive rocks. These great eruptions of the central\r\n      volcano continued till the month of February, 1760. In the\r\n      following years they became gradually less frequent.... The\r\n      roofs of the houses of Queretaro were then covered with\r\n      ashes at a distance of more than forty-eight leagues in a\r\n      straight line from the scene of the explosion. Although\r\n      the subterranean fire now appears far from violent, and\r\n      the Malpays and the great volcano begin to be covered with\r\n      vegetation, we nevertheless found the ambient air heated to\r\n      such a degree by the action of the small ovens, that the\r\n      thermometer at a great distance from the surface and in the\r\n      shade rose as high as 43° C.\" (109° 4' F.).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nMID-OCEAN VOLCANIC ISLANDS\r\n\r\n\r\nBesides the volcanoes we have already described, there are many others\r\nsituated in mid-ocean far from any continent. A brief description will\r\nbe given of a few of these.\r\n\r\nAll the three great central oceans, the Pacific, the Atlantic, and the\r\nIndian, contain numerous volcanic islands, some of which rise many\r\nthousands of feet above the general level.\r\n\r\nWe will begin with a description of some of the more important\r\nvolcanic islands of the Pacific. It was first pointed out by Kotzebue,\r\nand afterwards by Darwin, that all the islands of the Pacific Ocean\r\ncan be divided into two great classes, the _high islands_ and the\r\n_low islands_. All the high islands are of volcanic origin, while\r\nthe low islands are of coral formation. It is the opinion of Dana,\r\nwho has made a careful study of coral formations, especially in the\r\nPacific, that in all probability even the low islands of the Pacific\r\nwere originally volcanic, and that the deposits of coral had been made\r\nalong their shores after their volcanoes had become extinct.\r\n\r\nThe islands of the Pacific, like the shores of the continents and\r\nmost of their mountain ranges, extend in two great lines of trend, or\r\ngeneral direction, which intersect each other nearly at right angles.\r\nThese lines extend from the southeast to the northwest, and from the\r\nnortheast to the southwest respectively, those extending in a general\r\ndirection from southeast to northwest being the most common in the\r\nPacific.\r\n\r\nNow, perhaps, the greatest number of the earth's volcanoes are\r\narranged along fissures, or cracks in the earth's crust. The craters\r\nare situated along the cracks, the openings being kept clear at the\r\ncrater, and gradually closing elsewhere, probably by pressure. In\r\nother words, most of the volcanoes follow one another along more or\r\nless straight lines. For example, in the western part of South America\r\nthey follow the Andes Mountains. A similar arrangement exists in the\r\nvolcanoes of Central America, Mexico, and the United States. Now, this\r\nis especially true of mid-ocean volcanoes of the Pacific which lie\r\nalong lines extending from southeast to northwest, or from northeast\r\nto southwest, though mainly along the former.\r\n\r\nSome of the volcanic islands of the Pacific have already been\r\ndescribed or referred to, as, for example, the Aleutian Islands,\r\nwhich stretch in a curved line from the southwestern extremity of\r\nthe peninsula of Alaska to Kamtschatka on the coast of Asia. We have\r\nalready described the island of Hawaii, the great volcanoes of the\r\nSandwich Islands chain, and besides these there are in the North\r\nPacific the Ladrone Islands, lying east of the Philippines.\r\n\r\nSome of the principal remaining islands are: the Fejee Islands, which\r\nare volcanic, with numerous hot springs and craters. The Friendly\r\nIslands, with the peak of Tafua, 2,138 feet high, an active volcano\r\nwith a large crater always burning, and two other volcanoes, Apia,\r\nand Upala. Tahiti, to the east, is at present extinct. One of its\r\nmountains, Orobena, said to be 10,000 feet high, has a crater on its\r\nsummit. The Marquesas, still further to the east, are also volcanic.\r\nAll of these islands lie generally in the lines of the northeast\r\ntrend.\r\n\r\nThe Tongan or New Zealand Island chain extends in the direction of\r\nthe northeast trend. This, as you will see, is the direction in which\r\nthe two islands of New Zealand extend. The Tongan Island chain is\r\ncontinued to the south through Auckland and the Macquaire Islands to\r\n58° S. Towards the north, in almost the same line, are the Kermadec\r\nIslands near 30° S.\r\n\r\nThere are several active volcanoes in New Zealand. An explosive\r\neruption of Tarawera, in New Zealand, in 1883, continued for several\r\ndays, and was followed, three days afterwards, by an outburst in an\r\nactive volcano in the Bay of Plenty, and two months afterwards, by a\r\nviolent outburst in a volcano on the island of Ninafou in the Tongan\r\nIslands.\r\n\r\nComing now to the Atlantic Ocean we find a number of volcanic\r\nmountains in the deep waters near mid-ocean. The principal of these,\r\nbesides Iceland, are the Azores, the Canaries, Cape Verde Islands,\r\nAscension Island, St. Helena Island, and Tristan d'Acunha. The Peak\r\nof Pico, in the Azores, rises to a height of 7,016 feet. The Peak\r\nof Teneriffe, in the Canaries, reaches the height of 12,225 feet.\r\nTeneriffe is a snow-capped mountain. It has a cone on its summit with\r\nprecipitous walls like Vesuvius. Sulphurous vapors are continually\r\nformed at its summit, but no flames can be seen.\r\n\r\nIn the Cape Verde Islands is to be found the active volcanic mountain\r\nof Fuego, rising 7,000 feet above the sea. It has a central cone that\r\nhas been broken down on one side like that of Somma on Vesuvius. Fuego\r\nwas in eruption in 1785, and also in 1799.\r\n\r\nAscension Island, south of the equator, is formed entirely of volcanic\r\nmaterials. This island rises from an apparently granite floor on the\r\nbed of the ocean, in water 12,000 feet deep.\r\n\r\nSt. Helena lies further to the south. It is an extinct volcano, and\r\nhas the remains of a crater on its summit with lava dikes in various\r\nparts of the island.\r\n\r\nTristan d'Acunha is an isolated mountain that lies in the South\r\nAtlantic, south of St. Helena, 1,500 miles from Africa, the nearest\r\nland. It is an extinct volcano that rises from a depth of 12,150 feet\r\nto a height of 7,000 feet above the sea. It has a truncated cone on\r\nits summit and a lake of pure water in its old crater.\r\n\r\nThere are only a few volcanic islands in the Indian Ocean. Kerguelen\r\nIsland lies in the southern waters. St. Paul and Amsterdam to the\r\nnorth, lying near 40° S. lat., as well as the Crozet Islands, are\r\nextinct volcanoes.\r\n\r\nIn the Arctic Ocean is the volcanic island of Jan Mayen. In the\r\nAntarctic Ocean, as far as is known, there are only two volcanoes,\r\nMt. Erebus and Mt. Terror. Mt. Erebus, 12,400 feet high, is an active\r\nvolcano. Mt. Terror, 10,990 feet high, is an extinct volcano.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nSUBMARINE VOLCANOES\r\n\r\n\r\nA submarine volcano is a volcano that erupts on the bed of the ocean\r\nwith its crater covered by the waters. Many of the great volcanic\r\nmountains of the world began as submarine volcanoes. A crater first\r\nopened on the floor of the ocean, and lava escaping, was heaped up\r\naround the opening, until it emerged above the surface as an island.\r\nAs we have seen, the island of Iceland is believed to have begun in\r\nthis way. Such, too, in all probability, was the origin of Hawaii,\r\nVesuvius, Etna, and Santorin.\r\n\r\nBut besides the volcanic mountains that were thrown up during the\r\ngeological past, there are others that have been called into existence\r\nwhile man has been living on the earth. We will now describe a few\r\nislands that have been formed in this manner by submarine volcanic\r\neruptions.\r\n\r\nThat volcanic eruptions, or at least something that greatly resembles\r\neruptions, occur on the bed of the ocean too far below the surface to\r\npermit them to be directly seen from above, has been shown in a number\r\nof cases where the captains of vessels have reported that in certain\r\nparts of the ocean, jets of water, or steam, and pillars of flame have\r\nbeen seen rising to great heights from the surface of the water, and\r\nthat in certain regions sulphurous smoke has also been seen. During\r\nsuch occurrences, the water is agitated, as if it were being violently\r\nboiled. Moreover, these parts of the ocean are shaken by severe\r\nearthquake shocks.\r\n\r\nAnother evidence of submarine volcanic eruptions is to be found in\r\ngreat quantities of ashes, scoriæ, or pumice stone, that are seen\r\nspread out over the surface of the ocean after the commotions referred\r\nto in the preceding paragraph. Still another proof is that parts of\r\nthe ocean whose waters were previously very deep are found to have\r\nsuddenly shoaled.\r\n\r\nOf course, the best proof is the appearance of rocky reefs or small\r\nislands thrown up above the surface of the water, especially where\r\nvolcanic cones appear. While in many cases the new islands thus thrown\r\nup are subsequently washed away by the waves, yet some have continued\r\nabove the water.\r\n\r\nOne of the most noted instances of the formation of an island by a\r\nsubmarine volcano was Sabrina, which was thrown up in 1811, in the\r\nAtlantic Ocean, off the shores of St. Michael in the Azores Islands.\r\nSabrina had a cone that was 300 feet in height. It did not long remain\r\nabove the waters, however, being soon washed away by the waves. It is\r\ninteresting to note that in the same part of the ocean where Sabrina\r\nappeared, other islands have appeared and disappeared, at times long\r\nbefore 1811; that is, during the year 1691, as well as during 1720.\r\n\r\nAnother instance of a submarine island is Graham's Island, that was\r\nthrown up in 1831, in the Mediterranean Sea, between the west coast\r\nof Sicily and the nearest part of Africa, on which ancient Carthage\r\nwas situated. The part of the sea where the island was thrown up had\r\npreviously a depth of 600 feet.\r\n\r\nThe general appearance of Graham's Island is represented in Fig. 22.\r\n\r\nGraham's Island was formed by accumulations of loose scoria and\r\ncinders, together with blocks of lava and fragments of limestone. It\r\nreached a height of 200 feet above the water, but only remained above\r\nthe surface for a few months, when it was washed away, leaving a\r\nsubmarine bank some twelve miles in width, that was covered by water\r\nof about 150 feet, but which, however, increased rapidly in depth\r\ntowards the edge until depths of from 1,200 to 2,000 feet were reached.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22. GRAHAM'S ISLAND--A RECENT VOLCANIC\r\nISLAND]\r\n\r\nAccording to Lyell, on the 28th of June, 1831, before Graham's Island\r\nappeared, a ship passing over this portion of the sea felt severe\r\nearthquake shocks. On July 10th of the same year, the captain of a\r\nvessel from Sicily reported that as he passed near this part of the\r\nMediterranean, a column of water, 800 yards in circumference, was seen\r\nto rise from the sea to a height of sixty feet, and that afterwards a\r\ncolumn of steam rising to a height of 1,800 feet was seen in the same\r\nplace. On again passing the same region on July 18th, this captain\r\nfound a small island about twelve feet in height, with a crater in\r\nits centre, that was throwing out volcanic materials, together with\r\nimmense masses of vapor.\r\n\r\nThe island thus formed grew rapidly, both in size and height. When\r\nvisited at the end of July, it had attained a height of from fifty to\r\nninety feet, and was three-quarters of a mile in circumference. By\r\nAugust 4th, it had reached a height of 200 feet, and was then some\r\nthree miles in circumference. From this time, however, the island\r\nbegan to decrease in size, as the waves began to wash it away. By\r\nAugust 25th, it was only two miles in circumference. On September\r\n3d, it had decreased to three-fifths of a mile in circumference, and\r\ncontinued to decrease until it entirely disappeared, so that in the\r\nyear 1832, there were, according to measurements, some 150 feet of\r\nwater over its former site.\r\n\r\nThe Mediterranean Sea between Sicily and Greece is also especially\r\nliable to submarine activity. New islands appear and disappear so\r\nfrequently that in this region they are almost regarded as common\r\nphenomena.\r\n\r\nThere are many other parts of the ocean where submarine volcanic\r\neruptions are common. This is especially the case in the narrowest\r\npart of the Atlantic Ocean between Africa and South America. Here\r\nthere is a region situated partly above the equator, though for the\r\ngreater part south of the equator, frequently visited by submarine\r\neruptions, that are accompanied by earthquakes, by the agitation of\r\nthe water, by the appearance of floating masses of ashes and scoriæ,\r\nas well as by columns of steam or smoke. Floating masses of ashes and\r\nscoriæ sometimes occur so thick as to retard the progress of vessels.\r\n\r\nBut what forms, perhaps, one of the best instances of a large island\r\nformed by submarine eruptions during historical times, is Bogosloff\r\nIsland in Behring Sea, some forty miles west of Unalaska Island. This\r\nisland, the position of which is seen on the accompanying map, is\r\nknown to the Russians as Ioanna Bogoslova, or St. John the Theologian.\r\nIt is situated in lat. 53° 58' N., long. 168° west. It is said that\r\nduring the year 1795, some of the natives of Unalaska Island saw what\r\nthey thought was a fog in the neighborhood of a small rock, which they\r\nhad known for a long time to project above the sea in these waters.\r\nThis rock was marked on some Russian chart dated 1768-69. It was seen\r\nby Captain Cooke, in 1778, and was named by him Ship Rock.\r\n\r\nBut it was not a fog that the Unalaskans had seen in the neighborhood\r\nof Ship Rock; for, to their great surprise, the fog continued in sight\r\nalthough everywhere else the air was quite clear. Of course, this\r\nwas a great mystery to the people. During the spring of 1796, one of\r\nthem, who possessed either greater curiosity than the rest, or greater\r\ncourage, or both, visited the rock. He returned, telling the strange\r\nstory that all the ocean around the rock was boiling, and that the\r\nmist or fog was caused by the rising steam. What was taking place was\r\na submarine eruption. During May, 1796, sufficient matter had been\r\nbrought up from below to increase greatly the area of the small rock.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23. ALEUTIAN ISLANDS]\r\n\r\nDuring later years several attempts have been made to visit Bogosloff\r\nIsland. For example, the island was visited during 1872 and 1873,\r\nwhen it was found to have increased in height to 850 feet. But no\r\nappearance of any volcanic crater was to be seen.\r\n\r\nDuring October, 1883, a great volcanic eruption occurred there.\r\nConsiderable changes were produced in its shape, as well as in the\r\ndepth of the surrounding water. During this eruption, clouds of steam\r\ncompletely hid the island. Great quantities of ashes obscured the\r\nlight of the sun. After the eruption, a new island was thrown up near\r\nthe old one, in a place where the water had previously been deep\r\nenough for the ready passage of ships. The new island was about half a\r\nmile from the old one. It was conical in form, from 500 to 800 feet in\r\nheight, and about three-quarters of a mile in diameter.\r\n\r\nThe new island was visited in 1884 by the U. S. Revenue Marine Steamer\r\n_Corwin_. Lieutenant Cartwell, who visited the island at this time,\r\ndescribed it as follows:\r\n\r\n      \"The sides of New Bogosloff rise with a gentle slope to the\r\n      crater. The ascent at first appears easy, but a thin layer\r\n      of ashes, formed into a crust by the action of rain and\r\n      moisture, is not strong enough to sustain a man's weight.\r\n      At every step my feet crushed through the outer covering\r\n      and I sank at first ankle-deep and later on knee-deep into\r\n      a soft, almost impalpable dust which arose in clouds and\r\n      nearly suffocated me. As the summit was reached, the heat\r\n      of the ashes become almost unbearable, and I was forced\r\n      to continue the ascent by picking my way over rocks whose\r\n      surfaces being exposed to the air, were somewhat cooled and\r\n      afforded a more secure foothold.\r\n\r\n      \"On all sides of the cone there are openings through\r\n      which steam escaped with more or less energy. I observed\r\n      from some vents the steam was emitted at regular\r\n      intervals, while from others it issued with no perceptible\r\n      intermission. Around each vent there was a thick deposit of\r\n      sulphur, which gave off suffocating vapors.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION OF THE EARTH'S VOLCANOES\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving now considered at some length the principal volcanoes of the\r\nearth, and endeavored to obtain some idea of the many wonders they\r\nexhibit, especially as regards the vast quantities of material they\r\nbring from the inside of the earth, as well as the great force with\r\nwhich they sometimes throw these materials out of their craters, it\r\nwill be well to point out where such volcanoes are to be found.\r\n\r\nIt may have seemed to you, when you have carefully followed what has\r\nbeen said about the earth's volcanoes, that they are to be found\r\npretty nearly everywhere, at least so far as latitude is concerned;\r\nand in this supposition you are correct; for there are volcanoes in\r\nthe Arctic Ocean, as in the volcanic island of Jan Mayen between\r\nIceland and Spitzbergen, there are Mt. Erebus and Mt. Terror in the\r\nAntarctic Ocean, besides very numerous volcanoes in the Atlantic,\r\nPacific, and Indian Oceans, and their shores in both the temperate and\r\nthe torrid zones.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, one thing that you have probably especially\r\nnoticed and that is that volcanoes are seldom found at very great\r\ndistances from the ocean, except on some of its arms or seas, such\r\nas the Mediterranean Sea. I do not mean by this that all the earth's\r\nvolcanoes are either situated directly on the coast of the continents\r\nor on islands, since, in such a large body as the earth, a distance of\r\na few hundred miles from the ocean is hardly to be regarded as being\r\nvery far from it. But it is true that all the earth's volcanoes are\r\neither situated on the coasts of the continents, or on islands, and,\r\nmoreover, they are situated to a greater or less extent along lines,\r\nwhich, as we have already pointed out, are believed to mark weak\r\nportions of the earth's crust that have been fissured or fractured.\r\n\r\nIn order that you may have some idea of this distribution, I think it\r\nwill be well to give you a number of interesting facts that have been\r\npointed out by Dana. According to this authority, there are something\r\nin the neighborhood of 300 active volcanoes on the earth. Of these,\r\nno less than five-sixths, or 250, lie either on the borders of the\r\nPacific Ocean, or on some of its many islands. Thirty-nine either\r\nlie within or on the borders of the Atlantic, of which thirteen are\r\nin Iceland, or near the Arctic Circle, three in the Canaries, seven\r\nin the Mediterranean Sea, six in the Lesser Antilles, and ten in\r\nthe Atlantic Oceanic Islands. The Indian Ocean contains only a few\r\nactive volcanoes. There are, however, a much greater number of extinct\r\nvolcanoes, which may at any time again become active.\r\n\r\nThe following is the distribution of the earth's volcanoes as given\r\nby Dana. As you will see, from an inspection of Fig. 24, all of the\r\nregions of volcanoes lie either on the borders of the continents, or\r\non islands in the oceans. The districts are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. _Scattered Over the Pacific Ocean._--This district includes the\r\nfollowing active volcanoes; i. e., the Hawaiian Islands, nearly in\r\nmid-ocean, almost directly below the Tropic of Cancer; in the west\r\ncentral parts of the South Pacific; in the New Hebrides; in the\r\nFriendly Islands, the Tongan or New Zealand Islands, in the Santa Cruz\r\nIslands, and in the Ladrones.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24. MAP OF THE WORLD, SHOWING LOCATION OF\r\nACTIVE AND RECENTLY EXTINCT VOLCANOES]\r\n\r\n2. _On the Borders of the Pacific._--This district includes the\r\nvolcanoes that extend from the southern part of South America\r\nat intervals along the Andes Mountain range. Of these there are\r\nthirty-two in Chile, seven or eight in Bolivia and Southern Peru;\r\nabout twenty in the neighborhood of Quito. Further north there are\r\nthirty-nine in Central America, and seven in Mexico. Proceeding\r\nnorthwards through the United States, there are a number of volcanic\r\nmountains, generally extinct, in portions of the Sierra Nevadas\r\nand Cascade Ranges. Probably a number of volcanic mountains exist\r\nin portions of Canada lying between the northern boundaries of the\r\nUnited States and Alaska, and a number in Alaska; some twenty-one\r\nvolcanic mountains in the Aleutian Islands; some fifteen or twenty\r\nin Kamtschatka; thirteen in the Kuriles; some twenty-five or thirty\r\nin Japan and the neighboring islands; some fifteen or twenty in the\r\nPhilippines; several along the northern coasts of New Guinea; a number\r\nin New Zealand and south of Cape Horn; the volcanoes of the Deception\r\nIsland with its hot springs, and also in the South Shetlands 62° 30' S.\r\n\r\n3. _In the Indian Ocean._--On the western border of the Indian Ocean\r\nthere are a few volcanoes in Madagascar; in the Island of Bourbon;\r\nMauritius; the Comoro Islands; and in Kerguelen Land on the south.\r\nThere are also volcanoes on the western border of the Indian Ocean\r\nwhere the lofty peak of Kilima Ndjro, 18,000 feet, is volcanic.\r\n\r\n4. _Over the Seas that Separate the Northern and the Southern\r\nContinents and in their Vicinity._--This is an especially active\r\nregion of volcanoes. For the sake of convenience the continents of the\r\nworld are sometimes divided into three pairs or double continents;\r\nnamely, North and South America, connected by the Isthmus of Panama;\r\nEurope and Africa, connected by the Isthmus of Suez; and Australia and\r\nAsia, completely separated by a sunken isthmus, the summits of which\r\nform the Sunda Island chain. In the first of these regions we have the\r\nvery active group of the West Indies, where there are ten volcanic\r\nislands. In the second pair of double continents we have the volcanoes\r\nof the Mediterranean and Red Seas, and their borders, such as Sicily,\r\nVesuvius, and other parts of Italy, Spain, Germany, the Grecian\r\nArchipelago, Asia Minor, and extending eastward through the Caspian,\r\nMt. Ararat, Demavend, on the south shores of the Caspian, Mt. Ararat,\r\nand some few others along the borders of the Red Sea.\r\n\r\nIn the East Indies we find the most intense centre of volcanic\r\nactivity in the world. Here there are some 200 volcanoes of which\r\nthere are nearly fifty in Java alone, more than half of which are\r\nstill active. There are nearly as many volcanoes in Sumatra, and many\r\nin the small islands near Borneo, the Philippines, etc.\r\n\r\n5. _On the Borders of the Atlantic and Elsewhere._--It is an\r\ninteresting fact that there are no volcanoes on the eastern borders\r\nof the Atlantic north of the West Indies Island chain. In the South\r\nAtlantic the only volcano on the borders is one of the Cameroons\r\nMountains. In the Atlantic Ocean we have Iceland, the Azores, the\r\nCanaries, Cape Verde, Ascension, St. Helena, and Tristan d'Acunha.\r\n\r\nThis curious distribution of the volcanoes of the world near the\r\noceanic waters appears to be dependent rather on the very early shapes\r\nof the continents and the ocean beds than on their present shapes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nVOLCANOES OF THE GEOLOGICAL PAST\r\n\r\n\r\nThe question is often asked whether the volcanic eruptions of the\r\ngeological past were not much more violent and destructive than the\r\nvolcanoes of the present time. Now, while this is a matter that\r\nproperly belongs to the subject of geology, and will be treated at\r\ngreater length in the Wonder Book on Geology, yet a short mention\r\nshould be made of it here.\r\n\r\nIt is the opinion of Dana that while there have been volcanoes during\r\nthe different geological ages, yet volcanic activity has increased\r\nthrough the geological past until the age that immediately preceded\r\nthe appearance of man on the earth. He thinks there is no reason for\r\nbelieving that there were any very great volcanic eruptions during the\r\nearliest geological time known as the Archæic. Dana speaks as follows\r\nconcerning this:\r\n\r\n      \"In this connection it is an instructive fact that in\r\n      eastern North America, at epochs when there was the\r\n      greatest amount of friction and crushing ... those of the\r\n      making of the Green Mountains and the Appalachians ... no\r\n      volcanoes were made, and little took place in the way of\r\n      eruptions through fissures.\"\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Prestwich seems inclined to think that the absence\r\nof well-marked cones of volcanic material in the rock of the older\r\ngeological ages is not to be regarded as proof that no eruptions then\r\ntook place, since the very great amount of erosion that occurred\r\nbetween that time and the Tertiary Age before the appearance of man,\r\nwould, probably, have completely obliterated any cones, and even the\r\nvolcanic materials would have undergone such changes as completely to\r\nalter their general character. He agrees, however, with Dana that,\r\nprobably, the most violent and explosive volcanoes of the geological\r\nages have been those of the Tertiary Age.\r\n\r\nWithout, however, attempting anything more than a brief reference to\r\nthe volcanoes of the geological past, it may be said that many of the\r\nmore important of the active volcanoes of the earth's present time\r\nwere begun in the Tertiary Age. Mt. Etna, Vesuvius, and Mt. Hecla are\r\nbelieved to have commenced at this time.\r\n\r\nThere is an interesting region of geological volcanoes in the\r\nneighborhood of Auvergne in Central France. Here they occur in three\r\nseparate groups that extend over a high granite platform from north\r\nto south for a distance of about 100 miles, and from twenty to eighty\r\nmiles from east to west. The eruptions began in the earlier portions\r\nof the Tertiary Age, and continued down to the latter periods of\r\nprehistoric times. Some of these volcanic craters remain to-day almost\r\nas unaffected by erosion as if they had been formed but recently.\r\n\r\nOther regions of geological volcanoes are to be found in parts of\r\nSpain near the foot of the Pyrenees Mountains, in parts of Italy and\r\nGermany, as well as in regions in the Caucasus Mountains.\r\n\r\nIn Asia Minor there exists a group of almost thirty extinct volcanoes\r\nin the neighborhood of the Gulf of Smyrna. Both Little and Great\r\nArarat contain volcanic cones: that in the latter mountain was active\r\nduring historical times. There are also extensive volcanic districts\r\nin the Taurus Mountains. In addition to these there are groups of\r\nextinct volcanoes in portions of Central Asia.\r\n\r\nAden, on the Red Sea, is the centre of an extensive volcanic district.\r\nIndeed, on both shores of the Red Sea there are a few volcanoes that\r\nare still active, while in Sinai, and in the districts of the south,\r\nthere are several extinct craters.\r\n\r\nBut it is in the New World, especially on the Pacific coast of\r\nNorth America, that volcanic activity was especially great during\r\nthe geological past. There is a district containing volcanic rocks\r\nthat extends through various parts of western North America, from\r\nNew Mexico and North California, to Oregon and British Columbia.\r\nThis district has a width of from eighty to 200 miles, and a length\r\nof not quite 800 miles. This great area of nearly 150,000 square\r\nmiles is covered with great sheets of volcanic rocks except where\r\nmountain ranges rise from them, or where the rivers have cut deep\r\nvalleys through them. In portions of California and New Mexico these\r\nplateaus rise to heights of from 8,000 to 10,000 feet, while in parts\r\nof Colorado, where they form huge dome-like mountains, they reach a\r\nthickness of 14,000 feet. In Oregon the sheet of lava is 2,000 feet\r\nthick, and, indeed, in some places, is estimated to have a depth of\r\n7,000 feet.\r\n\r\nIn the opinion of nearly all American geologists these great lava\r\nflows in western North America were not of the type known as crater\r\neruptions, but were what are called fissure eruptions. Some of them\r\nare believed to have occurred during geological times as early as the\r\nEocene. Prestwich, however, is of the opinion that the eruptions of\r\nthe past in these portions of the world were not confined to fissure\r\neruptions, but that crater eruptions also occurred; and that it was\r\ntowards the close of the Tertiary Age that crater eruptions occurred\r\nwith great lava flows. Indeed, as we have seen, in portions of Utah\r\nand the neighborhood the remains of true craters can be found.\r\n\r\nBesides the above there are evidences of geological volcanoes of still\r\nolder times. In portions of Deccan, in southern Hindostan, there is an\r\nimmense plateau formed of trap rock, that extends from east to west\r\nfor a distance of 400 miles, and from north to south through from 700\r\nto 800 miles. This district, with an area of almost 200,000 square\r\nmiles, is covered with a vast lava sheet. It was, in the opinion of\r\nPrestwich, from whom many of the facts of the geological volcanic\r\neruptions have been obtained, probably still more extensive. The\r\nplateau of Deccan rises gradually from the east to the west, where, in\r\nsome parts of the Ghauts Mountains, it reaches a height of from 4,000\r\nto 5,000 feet.\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest of these prehistoric volcanoes of Scotland was a\r\nvolcano in the Isle of Mull in the Hebrides. This volcano was probably\r\nnearly thirty miles across at its base, and was from 10,000 to 12,000\r\nfeet high. It is now only 3,172 feet in height.\r\n\r\nAccording to Judd the Island of Skye in Inverness-shire is the remains\r\nof a volcano that was active in Tertiary times, probably many millions\r\nof years ago. This volcano was very large, probably about thirty miles\r\nacross at its base, with a height of perhaps as great as 12,000 or\r\n15,000 feet. Now there are only left some granite and other similar\r\nrocks that form the Red Mountains and Coolim Hills of Skye that reach\r\nabout 3,000 feet above the sea level.\r\n\r\nThere are many other parts of the world containing volcanoes that were\r\nactive during the geological past. The above, however, is as far as we\r\ncan describe such volcanoes in this book.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nLAPLACE'S NEBULAR HYPOTHESIS\r\n\r\n\r\nLaPlace's nebular hypothesis is the name given to an ingenious\r\nhypothesis proposed by LaPlace, a celebrated French astronomer, in an\r\nendeavor to explain how the solar system has been evolved.\r\n\r\nYou will notice that this is called a hypothesis and not a theory.\r\nThe word hypothesis is properly applied to a more or less intelligent\r\nguess or assumption, that has been made for the purpose of trying\r\nto find out in the cause of any natural phenomenon. A theory is an\r\nexpression of a physical truth based on natural laws and principles\r\nthat have been independently established. A theory, therefore, is much\r\nmore complete than a hypothesis. A hypothesis, as Silliman remarks,\r\nbears the same relation to a theory or law, that a scaffolding does to\r\na completed building, since it forms a convenient means for erecting\r\nthe building. LaPlace's work is properly called a hypothesis, because\r\nit is not to be considered as any more than a means for enabling one\r\nintelligently to inquire into the probable manner in which the solar\r\nsystem has reached its present condition, by gradual steps or stages\r\nduring the almost inconceivable length of time since its creation.\r\n\r\nBefore describing LaPlace's hypothesis it will be necessary to give\r\nyou some ideas concerning what is known by astronomers as the solar\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nThe solar system consists of the sun, and the eight large bodies\r\ncalled planets that revolve around the sun. It also includes a number\r\nof moons or satellites revolving around the planets, a number of small\r\nbodies, called planetoids or asteroids, together with numerous comets\r\nand meteorites. Besides these there is probably a system of meteoric\r\nbodies that are believed to revolve around the sun, and to produce, by\r\nthe reflection of the light from their surfaces, what is known as the\r\n_zodiacal light_.\r\n\r\nThe principal bodies of the solar system are the planets. These\r\nconstitute eight large bodies named in their order from the sun,\r\nbeginning with the nearest: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter,\r\nSaturn, Uranus, and Neptune. The last four planets, Jupiter, Saturn,\r\nUranus, and Neptune are much larger than the others, and are therefore\r\nknown as the _major planets_ in order to distinguish them from\r\nMercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars, which are called the _minor planets_.\r\nYou can remember the order in which the last three planets come by\r\ntheir initial letter, S-aturn, U-ranus, and N-eptune, spelling the\r\nword SUN, around which they all revolve.\r\n\r\nIt may be interesting to state here that the ancients knew of seven\r\nonly of these planets. Since, as they asserted, there were only seven\r\ndays in the week, and seven openings into the head; i. e., two for the\r\neyes, two for the nostrils, two for the ears, and one for the mouth,\r\nit was natural that there should be but seven planets. During later\r\nyears, however, an eighth planet was discovered and named Neptune. It\r\nwould be interesting to explain to you how the position of this planet\r\nwas reasoned out by mathematical calculations, that is, in other\r\nwords, how, as a result of such calculations, an astronomer was told\r\nthat if he would point his telescope to a certain part of the heavens\r\nhe would discover a new planet. He did this and located the planet\r\nNeptune. However interesting this story may be it belongs properly\r\nto astronomy, and will be described in full in the Wonder Book of\r\nAstronomy.\r\n\r\nIn the opinion of some astronomers it is quite probable that a ninth\r\nplanet will be found far beyond the orbit of Neptune. There may also\r\nbe some additional planets discovered between Mercury and the Sun.\r\n\r\nBesides the eight known planets there exist, somewhere between the\r\norbits of Mars and Jupiter, many smaller planets called _asteroids_,\r\nor _minor planets_. A long time ago it was pointed out by Bode that\r\na curious relation exists between the distances of the planets from\r\nthe sun. This relation or law is generally known, after the name of\r\nthe astronomer who first called attention to it, as _Bode's Law_.\r\nNo reason has been discovered for this arrangement of the planets,\r\nso that Bode's Law may be regarded as empirical. It may, however,\r\nbe mentioned here that the distances of all the planets from the\r\nsun agrees with the law very closely, with the single exception of\r\nNeptune, which is quite at variance with the law.\r\n\r\nIt was noticed at an early date, that a gap existed between Mars\r\nand Jupiter, so that astronomers began to believe that there was\r\nprobably a missing planet in that space, and this belief was greatly\r\nstrengthened when Neptune was discovered in 1781. Without going any\r\nfurther into this story in this book, it may be said that it is the\r\ngeneral opinion of astronomers that the planetoids or asteroids were\r\nformed possibly from the fragments of the missing planet, or, more\r\nprobably, from the breaking up of some of the outer rings on the\r\nplanet Mars.\r\n\r\nThe distances of the planets from the central sun vary from the\r\nnearest planet, Mercury, which is about 36,000,000 miles from the sun,\r\nto the furthest, or Neptune, which is 2,766,000,000 miles from the sun.\r\n\r\nAll the major planets have a single moon, or more, revolving around\r\nthem. For example, Jupiter has four moons; Uranus, six; Saturn, eight;\r\nNeptune, one. As to the minor planets, Mars has two moons; and, as far\r\nas is known, neither Mercury or Venus has a moon. Our earth has one\r\nmoon, but, as we shall afterwards see, this is not to be regarded as\r\na moon or satellite of the earth, but rather as a twin planet to the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nLaPlace's nebular hypothesis was proposed by LaPlace during the year\r\n1796. While there are many objections that can be brought against\r\nit, since it fails to account for all of the phenomena of the solar\r\nsystem, yet it is a significant fact now, in the year 1907, nearly a\r\ncentury and a quarter after the hypothesis was first announced, that\r\nalthough modified in many respects, there has not been any hypothesis\r\nproposed to entirely replace it.\r\n\r\nWhile the nebular hypothesis of LaPlace is necessarily a matter that\r\nbelongs to astronomy, yet it will be advisable to consider it here,\r\nsince it explains the source of the original heat of both the earth\r\nand the moon, which we believe is the true cause of volcanoes.\r\n\r\nIn his nebular hypothesis, LaPlace assumes that all the materials of\r\nwhich the solar system is formed, were originally scattered throughout\r\nspace in the shape of an exceedingly rare form of matter known as\r\nnebulous matter. He points out that if it be granted that this medium\r\nbegan to accumulate around a common centre, so as to form a huge globe\r\nor sphere, and if a motion of rotation on its axis from west to east\r\nwere given to this sphere that, on strictly mechanical principles, a\r\nsystem of heavenly bodies corresponding to the solar system might have\r\nbeen evolved. Let us, therefore, try to understand how this might have\r\nbeen brought about.\r\n\r\nThe nebulous matter that LaPlace assumed originally constituted all\r\nthe matter in the solar system, was highly heated gaseous matter. In\r\nother words, it consisted of ordinary matter raised to a very high\r\ntemperature; LaPlace thought at a temperature very much hotter than\r\nthat of the sun.\r\n\r\nAs this great mass of matter commenced to cool, it began to collect\r\naround a centre and slowly rotate. Its contraction or shrinkage, while\r\ncooling, must have caused an increase in the speed with which it spun\r\naround or rotated on its axis. At first it spun but sluggishly, but as\r\nit cooled and began to shrink this rate of rotation began slowly to\r\nincrease.\r\n\r\nNow you must bear in mind that the huge rotating mass, as imagined\r\nby LaPlace, was very many times larger than the size of our present\r\nsun. Indeed, instead of having a diameter of only 866,500 miles, its\r\ntemperature was so high that the nebulous matter of which it was\r\ncomposed had expanded it so much that it extended far beyond the orbit\r\nof Neptune, or had a diameter twice as great as 2,766,000,000 miles.\r\n\r\nAs the huge mass continued to shrink or contract, its rotation\r\nbegan to gradually increase until at last its centrifugal force was\r\nsufficiently great to cause it to bulge out at the equator, so as\r\nat last to separate a ring of gaseous matter. This ring was left\r\nbehind by the sun, as it continued cooling, and formed the first\r\nplanet that was born into the solar system. The ring might have\r\ncontinued to revolve around the sun for a time, and would, of course,\r\nrevolve in the same direction as that in which the sun was rotating,\r\nthat is, from west to east. Eventually, however, it broke up into\r\nsmaller fragments, that afterwards collected in a single body, and,\r\nassuming a globe-like shape of the planet, formed the planet Neptune.\r\nNecessarily, too, the planet so formed not only would revolve in its\r\norbit from west to east in the same direction in which the sun was\r\nrevolving on its axis, but would also rotate or spin on its axis in\r\nthe same direction.\r\n\r\nAfter, in this way, throwing off the first planet, the central sun\r\ncontinued to cool and grow smaller, until the increase in the rate\r\nof its rotation was again such as to permit its centrifugal force to\r\nform a second ring around its equator, which being left as the sun\r\ncontinued to contract, gave rise to another planet, or to Uranus, and\r\nso on until the four major planets and the four minor planets were\r\nborn.\r\n\r\nAccording to this hypothesis, the planet that was first born was the\r\nplanet that is farthest from the sun, that is, Neptune, and the planet\r\nlast born must have been the nearest planet, Mercury.\r\n\r\nBut while all this planet forming was going on, the separate planets\r\nalso continued to shrink, and, therefore, began to rotate more rapidly\r\non their axes. Under the influence of the centrifugal force, ring-like\r\nmasses began to form around their equators, and these masses left by\r\nthe planet constituted their moons or satellites. As you can see,\r\naccording to this hypothesis, just as the planets would all revolve in\r\ntheir orbits from west to east, and rotate on their axes in the same\r\ndirection as the sun, so, too, the moons or satellites of the planets\r\nwould also rotate on their axes, from east to west, and revolve in\r\ntheir orbits in the same direction.\r\n\r\nIn order to show the extent to which LaPlace's nebular hypothesis\r\nexplains the peculiarities of the solar system, we must inquire what\r\nare the most important of these peculiarities. We will take these from\r\nYoung's general book on Astronomy, from which most of the facts in\r\nthis chapter have been condensed. They are as follows:\r\n\r\nThe orbits of nearly all the planets and their satellites are nearly\r\ncircular; they are all in the same plane; and all revolve in the same\r\ndirection. They are, moreover, with the single exception of Neptune,\r\narranged at distances from the sun in accordance with Bode's Law.\r\n\r\nAll the planets increase in both directions, towards and from the sun,\r\nin density from Saturn, the least dense.\r\n\r\nAll the planets, with the exception probably of Uranus, rotate in a\r\nplane that is nearly the same as the plane of the orbit in which they\r\nrevolve. Moreover, with the exception of probably both Uranus and\r\nNeptune, all the planets rotate in the same direction as that in which\r\nthey revolve.\r\n\r\nThe satellites revolve in orbits whose planes nearly coincide with the\r\nplane of the planets' rotation, while the direction of the revolution\r\nof the satellites is the same as that in which their planets revolve.\r\n\r\nFinally, the largest planets rotate most swiftly.\r\n\r\nNow, LaPlace's nebular hypothesis explains nearly all of the above\r\nfacts. The following modifications of the hypothesis, however, are\r\nnecessary. Let us briefly examine some of these modifications.\r\n\r\nIn the first place it can be shown that the original nebulous mass\r\ninstead of being at a higher temperature than that of the sun was\r\nprobably at a much lower temperature, since the condensation of\r\nthe gaseous matter must have increased the temperature. Instead,\r\ntherefore, of the original nebulous mass being purely gaseous it was,\r\nas Young expressed it: \"Rather a cloud of ice cold meteoric dust than\r\nan incandescent gas or a fire mist.\" Or in other words, the original\r\nnebulous mass from which the solar system was evolved, consisted of\r\nfinely divided particles of solid or liquid matter surrounded by an\r\nenvelope of permanent gaseous matter.\r\n\r\nA doubt, too, has been raised as regards the manner in which the\r\nplanets were liberated from the central sun. Instead of separating in\r\nthe form of a regular ring, it has been thought that probably in most\r\ncases this separation assumed the shape of a lump. It might, however,\r\nhave occurred at times in the ring-like form as may be seen in the\r\ncase of the planet Saturn.\r\n\r\nAgain, instead of the outer rings being separated first, and the\r\nothers in regular order, so that the outer planets are much the older,\r\nit would seem possible, or, as Young states, even probable, that\r\nseveral of the planets may be of the same or nearly the same age, as\r\nthey would be if more than one ring had been separated at one time,\r\nor, indeed, several planets may have been formed from different zones\r\nof a single ring.\r\n\r\nAs you will see, LaPlace's nebular hypothesis assumes that both\r\nsun and moon were in a highly heated condition when they were\r\nseparated from the nebulous sun, so that we can understand that the\r\nformer molten condition of their interiors was due to the heat they\r\noriginally possessed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nTHE EARTH'S HEATED INTERIOR, THE CAUSE OF VOLCANOES\r\n\r\n\r\nAs we have already seen, the nebular hypothesis of LaPlace would seem\r\nto make it more than probable that the earth was originally in a\r\nhighly heated condition, and only reached its present state after long\r\ncooling. While this cooling has gone on for probably millions upon\r\nmillions of years both before and during the geological past, yet in\r\nthe opinion of perhaps the best geologists the interior of the earth\r\nis still very hot, only the outer portions or crust having hardened by\r\nloss of heat.\r\n\r\nThat there is a very hot region somewhere inside the earth is evident,\r\nsince from some place or places below the surface there come out\r\nthe immense streams of lava that, continuing to flow at irregular\r\nintervals, have at last built up such great masses of land as the\r\nisland of Hawaii, the still greater island of Iceland, the even\r\ngreater lava fields of the western United States, and the great\r\nplateau of the Deccan in southern Hindustan.\r\n\r\nIt certainly must have required a great quantity of lava to build up\r\nan island like Hawaii with its area of fully 40,000 square miles, for\r\nthe highest point on the summit of Mt. Kea reaches 13,805 feet above\r\nthe level of the sea, and, moreover, stands on the bed of the Pacific\r\nOcean in water fully 12,000 feet deep.\r\n\r\nBut Iceland is only one of many similar cases. Volcanoes are to\r\nbe found in practically all parts of the earth, not only in the\r\nequatorial regions, where they are especially numerous, but also in\r\nthe frigid and temperate zones. We must also remember the immense lava\r\nstreams that are known to have come from the interior during the great\r\nfissure eruptions of the geological past. When all these facts are\r\ntaken into consideration, it would certainly seem that there is only\r\none source sufficiently great to supply this wonderful demand, and\r\nthat is the entire inside of the earth.\r\n\r\nBut entirely apart from volcanic phenomena there are other proofs that\r\nthe entire interior of the earth is in a highly heated condition. The\r\ndifferences of temperature caused by the sun during day and night\r\ndo not affect the earth much below a depth of three feet, while the\r\ndifferences of temperature between summer and winter do not extend\r\nmuch further below the surface than forty feet. Below these depths, in\r\nall parts of the earth, the temperature of the crust rises at a rate,\r\nwhich, although not uniform, yet is not far from an increase of one\r\ndegree of the Fahrenheit thermometer scale for every fifty or sixty\r\nfeet of descent.\r\n\r\nIf the above rate of increase continues uniform the temperature of\r\nthe crust would be sufficiently hot to boil water at a distance of\r\nabout 8,000 feet below the surface, while at a depth of about thirty\r\nmiles the temperature would be sufficiently high to melt all known\r\nsubstances at ordinary conditions of atmospheric pressure; that is, to\r\nmelt all known substances if they were subjected to such a temperature\r\nat the level of the sea.\r\n\r\nIn considering the above we must not lose sight of the fact that this\r\nincrease in temperature with descent below the surface of the earth's\r\ncrust occurs, not only in places where there are volcanoes, but over\r\nall parts of the earth, thus seeming to point out that there is\r\nsomething hot below the surface which fills the entire inside of the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nIt is true the greatest distance to which man has actually gone down\r\nthrough the earth's crust is but a few miles. We do not, therefore,\r\nknow by actual experience that the interior is anywhere in a fused\r\ncondition, yet the escape of lava or molten rocks in all latitudes,\r\nand in the enormous quantities referred to above, seems to show that\r\nthe entire inside of the earth is at a temperature sufficiently high\r\nto melt all known substances under ordinary conditions.\r\n\r\nIt may be interesting in this connection to examine some of the proofs\r\nof this increase in temperature with descent below the surface. The\r\nfollowing figures are given by Dana:\r\n\r\nBorings to great depths have been made in various parts of the earth,\r\nboth for artesian wells as well as for the shafts of mines. After\r\npassing the line of invariable temperature, the rate of increase for a\r\ntotal distance of 4,000 feet below the surface is in the neighborhood\r\nof from one degree for fifty-five to sixty feet, or an average of\r\nfifty-seven and a half feet for each degree of heat. In the case of\r\nthe deep artesian well bored at Grenelle, Paris, where a temperature\r\nof eighty-five degrees Fahrenheit was reached at a distance of 2,000\r\nfeet, the rate of increase was somewhat more rapid, being one degree\r\nFahrenheit for every sixty feet.\r\n\r\nIn a deep well bored in a salt mine at Neusalzwerk, Prussia, a depth\r\nof 2,200 feet showed a temperature of ninety-one degrees Fahrenheit at\r\nthe bottom. This was at the rate of one degree for every fifty feet of\r\ndescent. At Schladenbach, in Prussia, a well has been dug to the depth\r\nof 5,735 feet with a temperature of 134° F. A boring at Wheeling, in\r\nWest Virginia, reached a depth of 4,500 feet, 3,700 feet below the\r\nlevel of the sea. Here the rate of increase of temperature in the\r\nupper half was one degree Fahrenheit for every eighty feet, and in\r\nthe lower half of one degree for every sixty feet.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed because the rate of increase of temperature is\r\nnot uniform that the argument of a highly heated interior is weakened.\r\nOn the contrary, it would be very surprising if the rate continued\r\nuniform; for it is evident that the conducting power of different\r\nmaterials in the earth's crust for heat must necessarily make a great\r\ndifference in the rate at which heat should increase, as we go farther\r\ndown into the earth. This is so important a matter that I will explain\r\nit at somewhat greater length.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose that instead of the highly heated interior of the\r\nearth, we consider the simple case of a hot stove, the doors or other\r\nopenings into which are closed so that it is impossible to see the\r\nred hot coals inside. Now, suppose holes were bored in the sides of\r\nthis stove not deep enough to reach the red hot mass within, and that\r\ntightly fitting rods or plugs all of the same length and thickness,\r\nbut of different kinds of materials such as wood, earthenware, glass,\r\niron, copper, silver, and gold, etc., were so placed in the holes as\r\nto tightly fit them. Now, under these circumstances the end of all\r\nthe plugs would be at the same distance from the heated inside. They\r\nwould not, however, by any means show the same temperatures, the\r\nmetallic rods would be too hot to touch, while the end of the piece\r\nof wood would hardly be hot enough to burn the hand when held against\r\nit. The piece of glass and earthenware though less cool would be much\r\nless hot than the different rods of metals. Their temperatures would\r\nbe necessarily affected by their conducting power for heat. The wood,\r\nthe glass, and the earthenware being poorer conductors than the metals\r\nwould show much lower temperatures.\r\n\r\nNow, the same thing is true with the different materials that\r\nconstitute the rocks of the earth's crust. Some of these are much\r\nbetter conductors of heat than others, so that the rate of increase of\r\ntemperature with descent below the surface must necessarily vary with\r\nthe kind of materials that form the crust of different parts of the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nYou may, therefore, safely conclude that the entire interior of the\r\nearth is in a highly heated condition, and that the source of this\r\nheat is to be traced to the heat the earth originally possessed when,\r\nin accordance to the nebular hypothesis of LaPlace, it was separated\r\nfrom the sun which gave birth to it, that the present crust of the\r\nearth has been formed on the outside by the loss of a portion of this\r\nheat.\r\n\r\nThe rapidity with which a body cools, depends, among other things,\r\non the difference between its temperature and that of the medium in\r\nwhich it is placed. The greater this difference of temperature the\r\ngreater the rapidity of cooling. Careful measurements made by Tait,\r\nthe English physicist, show that our earth loses every year from each\r\nsquare foot of surface, an amount of heat that would be able to raise\r\nthe temperature of one pound of water from the melting point of ice to\r\nthe boiling point of water, or from 32° F. to 212° F. The rate of loss\r\nof heat, must, therefore, have been much greater when the earth was\r\nmore highly heated than it is now, and will be much smaller than now\r\nmany years from the present.\r\n\r\nNow, let us suppose, what nearly everyone acknowledges to be true,\r\nthat the earth was originally so hot as to be a molten globe, and that\r\nwhile in this molten condition, it began to revolve or move around the\r\nsun. Since the empty space through which the earth moves is very cold,\r\nsomething in the neighborhood of 45° below the zero of the Fahrenheit\r\nthermometer scale, the loss of heat would take place very rapidly and\r\na thin crust of hardened materials would be formed on the outside. Now\r\nall the time the earth is cooling, it is shrinking or growing smaller.\r\n\r\nA very little thought will convince you that this cooling or shrinkage\r\ncould not go on uninterruptedly; for, while the earth was cooling it\r\nwas contracting, or growing smaller, and in this way a great pressure,\r\nor as it is generally called in science, a great stress was being\r\nproduced. Every now and then this stress became so great that the\r\ncrust of the earth was fractured or broken.\r\n\r\nAt first these fractures would not require a very great amount of\r\nstress or force, since the crust of lava was then very thin. After\r\ngreat periods of time, however, the crust grew thicker and thicker,\r\nand the amount of force required to break it continually increased, so\r\nthat the fractures of the crust produced a greater disturbance.\r\n\r\nWhenever the earth's crust was fractured in this way the earth was\r\nshaken by what are called earthquakes, while a part of the molten\r\ninterior would run out or escape, making volcanoes. In the very early\r\ntimes neither the earthquakes or the volcanoes were as energetic as\r\nthey were at later periods when the thickness of the earth's crust\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\nNow, having as we believe correctly come to the conclusion that the\r\nentire interior of the earth is in a highly heated condition, the\r\nnext question that arises is as to the present condition of this\r\ninterior. A long time ago it was believed that the interior of the\r\nearth is still melted, and that a cooled portion or crust surrounds\r\na great molten mass that fills all the inside; that it is this mass\r\nwhich supplies the immense quantities of molten rock or lava that\r\nescape through the craters of volcanoes or through the fissures in\r\nthe crust. Without going into this question thoroughly, since it is a\r\nvery difficult question to understand, it will be sufficient to say\r\nthat there are many reasons why it is impossible to believe that the\r\ninterior is still melted.\r\n\r\nYou will understand that if the interior of the earth were melted like\r\na huge central sea of fire that each volcano would necessarily affect\r\nall the others. Now, as we have seen, this is never the case, so that\r\nthis is one reason we cannot believe in the existence of a melted\r\ninterior.\r\n\r\nAnother reason we cannot believe in a molten interior is an\r\nastronomical consideration. It can be shown that under the attraction\r\nof the sun and moon the earth could not possibly behave as it does\r\nif it were still liquid in the interior. That, on the contrary, the\r\nbehavior of the earth to the attraction of the sun and moon is such as\r\nto make it necessary for us to believe that it is as rigid throughout\r\nas would be a globe of steel of the same size.\r\n\r\nI can easily understand that you find it very difficult to see how it\r\ncan be believed that the interior of the earth is solid and yet at the\r\nsame time be sufficiently hot to melt. I can imagine hearing you ask\r\nif it is hot enough in the inside to melt any known materials, why it\r\nis not melted. The reason, however, is very simple when you come to\r\nthink it over. For a solid to fuse or become melted, it is not only\r\nnecessary for it to be heated to a temperature which is different for\r\ndifferent substances, but that at the same time it is heated it shall\r\nhave plenty of room in which to expand or grow bigger. In other words,\r\nthe temperature required to fuse any substance increases very rapidly\r\nwith the pressure to which that substance is exposed.\r\n\r\nNow, try to think of the pressure to which the materials that fill\r\nthe inside of the earth are subjected at great distances below the\r\nsurface. This pressure is enormous, not only by reason of the weight\r\nof the many miles of rocks that are pressing down, but also by reason\r\nof the enormous stress or pressure caused by contraction or shrinkage.\r\nWhen we say that the interior of the earth is hot enough to melt all\r\nknown substances we mean hot enough to melt them if they could be\r\nbrought from great depths to the level of the sea, but not hot enough\r\nto melt them when subjected to the great pressure that exists in\r\nregions far below the surface of the earth.\r\n\r\nBriefly, the condition of things is believed to be as follows: The\r\nentire interior is filled with rock hot enough to melt at the level\r\nof the sea, but under too great pressure to melt. If this be granted,\r\nas it is by perhaps the greatest number of men who are competent to\r\njudge, the phenomena of earthquakes can be readily explained, as can,\r\nindeed, the phenomena of those great movements whereby great changes\r\nof level take place in different parts of the earth.\r\n\r\nNow let us see how volcanoes can be explained on the assumption that\r\nthe interior of the earth is hot enough to melt, but remains solid\r\nonly because there is no room for the heated mass to expand in. Such\r\na heated interior as we have imagined, must be constantly losing its\r\nheat and, therefore, shrinking. Every now and then this shrinkage must\r\nproduce great fissures or cracks in the solid crust of the earth.\r\nNow should such cracks or fissures extend downwards to the heated\r\ninterior, there must result a decrease in the pressure. The rocks\r\nwould, therefore, begin to expand and would be forced by the great\r\npressure to rise slowly in such cracks or fissures. The further they\r\nrise the greater the relief of pressure, until they at last assume a\r\nmolten condition in which they are forced out through the craters of\r\nvolcanoes as molten rocks or lava.\r\n\r\nBut it is not only volcanoes that seem to indicate a highly heated\r\nplastic condition as existing in the earth's interior. As geologists\r\nwell know, there are to be found in the various strata of the earth\r\nplaces where great fissures have been made at various times during the\r\ngeological past. These fissures vary in width from a few inches to\r\nmany hundreds of feet, and are frequently scores of miles in length.\r\nLava either flows out of them, and covers adjoining sections of the\r\ncountry, or simply rises in them and, afterwards cooling, forms dikes.\r\nIn many instances, however, the lava is forced in between more or less\r\nhorizontal layers and in some cases has caused these layers to assume\r\nthe shape of what geologists know as _subtruderant mountains_. Some\r\nof the eastern ranges of the Rocky Mountains have been formed in this\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nWe can, therefore, picture to ourselves the following as the manner\r\nof formation of an ordinary volcano. A fissure is first formed in the\r\nsolid crust of the earth, extending downwards to the regions of great\r\nheat. There is thus produced a relief of pressure, so that at this\r\npoint the highly heated rocks begin to be slowly forced up through the\r\nfissure. As they rise higher and higher they become less solid and\r\nfinally expand into fused masses that can flow out of the crater or\r\nopening in the earth's surface. In this way a volcano is started.\r\n\r\nBut for this volcano to continue in eruption, it is necessary that\r\nthe conditions shall continue that force the molten rock upwards from\r\ngreat depths. It is not enough for the lava to fill the crevice that\r\nexists upwards to the surface, it must continue to be forced upwards\r\nuntil it escapes. If it is permitted to remain in the fissure for any\r\ntime, it hardens, and only great dikes are formed. It would seem,\r\ntherefore, that some other force must be called into action to keep\r\nthe fissure open or, in other words, to prevent the chilling of the\r\nlava. Now, this force is generally believed to be the expansive force\r\nof steam or the vapor of water.\r\n\r\nAs Dana points out, by far the greater part of the vapor which escapes\r\nfrom the craters of volcanoes consists of steam or the vapor of water.\r\nIndeed, it can be shown that for every hundred parts of different\r\nvapors, at least ninety-nine of such parts consist of water vapor. It\r\nis for the greater part, to the pressure of steam or water vapor that\r\nthe escape of lava from the tube near the top of the crater is due.\r\n\r\nOf course, the question arises as to where the water comes from that\r\nproduces this steam. There are three possible sources. From the rains;\r\nfrom leakage at the bed of the ocean; and from vapors existing at\r\ngreat depths below the surface.\r\n\r\nIt is not probable that either rain water, or water from the ocean,\r\npenetrates through the earth's crust for distances much greater than a\r\nfew thousand feet. It is, however, very well known that in all parts\r\nof the earth, except in desert regions, whether they are near or far\r\nfrom the ocean, the rocks are always found fully charged with water.\r\nWhen, therefore, the slowly rising lava passes through the moist rocks\r\nthat everywhere form the crust of the earth, there must be formed in\r\nthem great quantities of steam under very high pressure. Moreover,\r\nmany substances, especially those forming lava, possess the power of\r\nabsorbing large quantities of steam and other gases. Therefore, as\r\nthe molten material reaches the moist rocks in the earth's crust, it\r\nbecomes highly charged with steam, and as the lava rises towards the\r\nsurface this steam expands.\r\n\r\nWhere the lava is in a very fluid condition the steam quietly escapes,\r\nas does the steam from the surface of boiling water. But where the\r\nlava is viscous, like tar or pitch, great bubbles are formed, which,\r\non their explosion, throw the lava upwards for great distances into\r\nthe air.\r\n\r\nWe can, therefore, account in this manner for both the non-explosive\r\nas well as the explosive type of volcanoes.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed, however, that it is the explosive power of\r\nsteam which is the principal cause of the lava rising upwards from\r\ngreat depths. This is caused by the great pressure or stress set up\r\nby the contraction of a cooling crust. The pressure of this steam is\r\nadded to this pressure which keeps the lava flowing upwards from great\r\ndepths below.\r\n\r\nThe objection has sometimes been urged that it is impossible to\r\nbelieve the lava comes from a highly heated interior, because, as is\r\nwell known, lavas are of different types even when coming from the\r\nsame volcano at different times of eruption. While such an objection\r\nwould have weight were it believed that the interior of the earth is\r\nstill in a molten condition, it loses its weight when one believes\r\nthat the interior is solid. It must, however, be acknowledged that\r\nthe largest part of the interior of the earth would probably have the\r\nsame chemical composition if it had ever been in a completely melted\r\ncondition throughout.\r\n\r\nI do not doubt you have already concluded that the reason the earth's\r\nvolcanoes are practically limited to the borders of continents,\r\nor to the shores of islands, is the leakage of the ocean waters\r\ninto the crust at these parts. This was at one time believed by\r\nmost geologists. That sea water has much to do with such volcanoes\r\nas Vesuvius there is no doubt, but it is now generally recognized\r\nthat it is not so much the present outlines of the earth, or the\r\npresent arrangement of its land and water areas, that determines the\r\ndistribution of the world's volcanoes. It is rather believed that the\r\nlocation of the lines of fractures along which the earth's volcanoes\r\nare found were determined by conditions that occurred long before the\r\nearth assumed its present outlines.\r\n\r\nBut there is another explanation that has been suggested as regards\r\nthe condition of the interior of the earth. Judd refers to this\r\nexplanation as follows:\r\n\r\n      \"Some physicists have asserted that a globe of liquid\r\n      matter radiating its heat into space, would tend to\r\n      solidify both at the surface and the centre at the\r\n      same time. The consequence of this action would be the\r\n      production of a sphere with a solid external shell and a\r\n      solid central nucleus, but with an interposed layer in a\r\n      fluid or semi-fluid condition. It has been pointed out that\r\n      if we suppose the solidification to have gone so far as\r\n      to have caused the partial union of the interior nucleus\r\n      and the external shell, we may conceive a condition of\r\n      things in which the stability and rigidity is sufficient to\r\n      satisfy both geologists and astronomers, but that in still\r\n      unsolidified pockets or reservoirs, filled with liquefied\r\n      rock, between the nucleus and the shell, we should have\r\n      a competent cause for the production of the volcanic\r\n      phenomena of the globe. In this hypothesis, however, it is\r\n      assumed that the cooling at the centre and the surface of\r\n      the globe would go on at such rate that the reservoirs of\r\n      liquid material would be left at a moderate depth from the\r\n      surface, so that easy communication could be opened between\r\n      them and volcanic vents.\"\r\n\r\nI must caution you, however, not to think that the above theory of\r\nvolcanoes is accepted by all scientific men. On the contrary, there\r\nare many who believe that the earth is solid throughout because it\r\nhas completely lost its original heat; that it is only comparatively\r\nsmall areas that are to be found filled with molten or at least highly\r\nheated material. But these opinions are held largely by those who have\r\ngiven their attention almost entirely to the phenomena of earthquakes,\r\nor who base their reasonings on mathematical grounds only and have not\r\nsufficiently considered the phenomena of volcanoes. Since, however,\r\nthey can be better understood after we have explained the phenomena of\r\nearthquakes, we will defer their discussion to the last chapters of\r\nthis book.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nSOME FORMS OF LAVA\r\n\r\n\r\nIn describing the wonders of volcanoes, we must not fail to say\r\nsomething of the many remarkable forms that lava is capable of\r\nassuming.\r\n\r\nAll volcanic lavas contain large quantities of an acid substance known\r\nas _silica_, or what is known better as _quartz sand_. This material\r\nexists in lava combined chemically with various substances called\r\nbases, the principal of which are alumina, magnesia, lime, iron,\r\npotash, and soda.\r\n\r\nAlthough there are many kinds of lava, yet all lavas can be arranged\r\nunder three great classes according to the quantity of silica they\r\ncontain.\r\n\r\n_Acid lavas_ are those in which the quantity of silica is greatest.\r\nIn these lavas the silica, which varies from 66 to 80%, is combined\r\nwith small quantities of lime or magnesia, and comparatively large\r\nquantities of potash or soda. Some of the most important varieties of\r\nacid lavas are known as _trachytes_, _andesites_, _rhyolites_, and\r\n_obsidians_.\r\n\r\n_Basic lavas_ are those containing from 45 to 55% of silica. They\r\nare rich in lime and magnesia, but poor in soda or potash. Some of\r\nthe most important of basic lavas are the _dolerites_ and _basalts_.\r\nGenerally speaking, basic lavas are of a darker color than acid lavas,\r\nand fuse at much lower temperatures.\r\n\r\n_Intermediate lavas_ are those containing silica in the proportion of\r\nfrom 55 to 66%.\r\n\r\nWhile the temperature of liquid lava has not been very accurately\r\ndetermined, yet, since we know that molten lava is able to melt silver\r\nor copper, its temperature must be somewhere between 2,500° F. and\r\n3,000° F., the melting point varying with the chemical composition.\r\n\r\nAccording to Dana lavas can be divided into the following classes\r\naccording to their fusibility; i. e., _lavas of easy fusibility_, such\r\nas _basalts_; these lavas fuse at about 2,250° F.; _lavas of medium\r\nfusibility_, including andesites; these lavas fuse at about 2,520° F.;\r\n_lavas of difficult fusibility_, such as trachytes; these lavas fuse\r\nat about 2,700° F.\r\n\r\nBut what is, perhaps, most curious about lavas is that when the\r\nsurface of a freshly broken piece of cold lava is carefully examined,\r\nit is found to contain a number of small crystals of such mineral\r\nsubstances as quartz, feldspar, hornblende, mica, magnetite, etc.\r\n\r\nThe best way to study the different forms of lava crystals is to\r\nprepare a thin transparent slice of hardened lava and then examine it\r\nwith a good magnifying glass. It will be found that the slice consists\r\nof a mass of a glass-like material through which the crystals are\r\nirregularly distributed, not unlike the raisins and currants in a\r\nslice of not over rich plumcake.\r\n\r\nWhen examined by a more powerful glass, such as a microscope, cloudy\r\npatches can be seen distributed irregularly through the glass-like\r\nmass. When these patches are examined by a higher power of the\r\nmicroscope they are seen to consist of small solid particles of\r\ndefinite forms known as _microliths_ and _crystallites_. It has been\r\nshown by a careful study of these minute objects that they form the\r\nexceedingly small particles of which crystals are built up.\r\n\r\nIf we fuse a small quantity of lava and then let it slowly cool, the\r\nglassy mass will be found to contain numerous crystallites. On the\r\nother hand, when fused lava is permitted to cool quickly, it takes on\r\nthe form of a black, glass-like mass known as _obsidian_ or _volcanic_\r\nglass, a very common form of lava in some parts of the world.\r\n\r\nIn some lavas there are found larger crystals that appear to have been\r\nseparated from the glassy mass, under the great pressure that exists\r\nin the subterranean reservoirs at great depths below the volcanic\r\ncrater, and then floated to the surface surrounded by the glass-like\r\nmaterial. Now when we examine these crystals with a higher power of\r\nthe microscope, we frequently find in them minute cavities containing\r\na small quantity of liquid and a bubble of gas, thus causing them to\r\nresemble small spirit levels. The liquid in such cavities has been\r\nexamined chemically and in most cases has been found to consist of\r\nwater containing several salts in solution. Sometimes, however, the\r\nliquid consists of liquefied carbonic acid gas. These wonderful things\r\nwill be discussed at greater length in the Wonder Book of Light.\r\n\r\nWhen the mass of molten rock or lava that comes out of the crater\r\nof a volcano is thrown upwards in the air the condition it assumes\r\nby the time it falls back again to the earth depends on the height\r\nit reaches. If this height is great the lava chills or hardens\r\nbefore reaching the earth, and assumes various forms according to\r\nthe size of the fragments. The largest of these fragments are called\r\n_cinders_; the finer particles _volcanic dust_; while most of those\r\nof intermediate particles are known among other things as _volcanic\r\nashes_.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen that when an explosive volcanic eruption occurs\r\nthere is suddenly thrown out of the crater of the volcano a huge\r\ncolumn of various substances that rises sometimes as high as 30,000\r\nfeet or even more. The smaller fragments of lava are quickly cooled\r\nand form volcanic ashes, sand, cinders, or dust. These are rapidly\r\nspread out by the wind in the form of a black cloud, that not only\r\ncovers the mountain but reaches out over the surrounding country,\r\ncompletely shutting off the light of the sun. From this cloud\r\nparticles of red hot ashes, cinders, sand, etc., begin to fall, the\r\nlargest particles near the crater of the volcano, and the smaller\r\nparticles at much greater distances. In very powerful explosive\r\nvolcanic eruptions such as Krakatoa, the finer dust may be carried to\r\npractically all parts of the world.\r\n\r\nVolcanic ashes consist of a fine, light, gray powder. These particles\r\ntake the name ashes from their resemblance to the ashes left after the\r\nburning of pieces of wood or coal in an open fire. The name, however,\r\nas Geicke points out, is unfortunate, since it is apt to lead one to\r\nsuppose that volcanic ashes consist of some burned material. Such an\r\nidea is erroneous, however, since ashes do not consist of anything\r\nthat is left after burning, but merely of fine particles of molten\r\nrock that have hardened by cooling. When in the shape of what is known\r\nas volcanic dust these particles are so exceedingly small that they\r\ncan readily make their way through the smallest openings in a closed\r\nroom just as does the finest dust in the rooms of our houses when\r\nthey are shut up. There are cases on record where people have been\r\nsuffocated by the entrance of volcanic dust in closed rooms to which\r\nthey have fled for safety during volcanic eruptions.\r\n\r\n_Volcanic sand_ consists of the coarser particles of chilled lava that\r\nare partly round and partly angular. They are of various sizes up to\r\nthat of an ordinary pea. Volcanic sand is formed by the breaking up of\r\nthe lava by the explosion of the vapors as they escape from the lava\r\non relief from pressure. Volcanic dust when examined by the microscope\r\nis found to consist of very small particles that are more or less\r\ncrystalline.\r\n\r\nBut besides the above there are larger fragments known as _lapilli_,\r\nconsisting of rounded or angular bits of lava varying in size from\r\nthat of a pea to an ordinary black walnut. These sometimes consist of\r\nsolid fragments, but are usually porous, sometimes so much so that\r\nthey readily float on water.\r\n\r\nA curious form sometimes assumed by lava consists of what are called\r\n_volcanic bombs_. These are formed during explosive eruptions,\r\nwhen masses of liquid lava are hurled high up into the air. During\r\ntheir flight they take on a rotary motion, which tends to make them\r\nglobular, so that cooling, while still revolving, they assume the\r\nform of a more or less spherical mass. At times, however, they are\r\nstill sufficiently soft when they strike the earth to be flattened out\r\nin the form of flat cakes. When of a spherical form these are very\r\nproperly called volcanic bombs.\r\n\r\nThat volcanic bombs have actually been subjected to a spinning motion\r\nwhile in the air can sometimes be shown by the fact that masses of\r\nscoriæ are frequently found in the interior with air cells largest at\r\nthe centre of the bomb.\r\n\r\nVolcanic bombs are sometimes thrown from the crater to great\r\ndistances. During one of its recent eruptions, Cotopaxi threw out\r\nbombs that fell at a distance of nine miles from the crater.\r\n\r\nAccording to Dana another form of lava bombs is sometimes found on the\r\nslopes of the active volcanoes of Hawaii, where masses of lava acquire\r\na ball-like shape while rolling down an inclination.\r\n\r\nWhat are sometimes called volcanic bombs, but which are more properly\r\n_volcanic vesicles_, are produced by small fragments of lava which\r\nare thrown up in the air for only a moderate height and, on cooling,\r\nassume pear-like forms. Fig. 25 represents the appearance of volcanic\r\nvesicles. The direction in which these vesicles moved through the air\r\nwhile in a molten state is indicated by their shape, the blunt end\r\nbeing the end towards which the particles were projected.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25. VOLCANIC VESICLES _From Dana's Manual\r\nof Geology_]\r\n\r\nBut by far the greater portion of the hardened lava; i. e., the\r\ncoarser, heavier particles, fall back on the mountain, and collecting\r\naround the crater build up volcanic cones, as already described in the\r\ncase of mountains of the Vesuvian type.\r\n\r\nThere are two different ways in which the melted lava is broken up\r\ninto fine particles when it is thrown upwards from the crater of the\r\nvolcano. Nearly all lava contains large quantities of steam that are\r\nshut up, or occluded in the mass, being prevented from escaping by\r\nreason of the pressure to which the lava is subjected. The lava is\r\nreleased from this pressure as it is thrown out of the crater. The\r\nsteam or gases escape explosively and thus break the lava into fine\r\nliquid spray, which rapidly hardens.\r\n\r\nThere is another way in which small particles of lava are formed.\r\nSometimes large pieces of hardened lava are shot upwards into the air\r\nwith a velocity as great as that with which a heavy projectile leaves\r\nthe muzzle of a large gun. These heavy particles striking against\r\none another, either while rising or falling, are broken into smaller\r\nfragments. Sometimes, indeed, these fragments fall back again into\r\nthe crater from which they are again violently thrown out, and are\r\nagain broken into smaller fragments either while rising or falling.\r\n\r\nYou will, probably, remember several instances of volcanic eruptions\r\nwhere masses of rock were thrown violently up into the air out of\r\nthe crater. These larger masses are known as _volcanic blocks_. They\r\nprobably consist of masses of hardened lava that have collected in\r\nthe tube of the volcano during some of its periods of inactivity.\r\nSometimes, however, they consist of fragments of rocks that are not\r\nof volcanic origin. Cases are on record where volcanic blocks have\r\nbeen thrown out of the craters in so great quantities as to cover the\r\nsurface of many square miles of land with fragments hundreds of feet\r\ndeep.\r\n\r\nThere is sometimes formed on the surface of a pool of lava as it\r\ncollects in the craters of such volcanoes as Mt. Loa or Kilauea, when\r\nthe volcanoes are not in eruption, a material resembling froth or\r\nscum. The same thing sometimes occurs on the surface of some kinds\r\nof lava as it runs down the side of the mountain. In this way a very\r\nlight variety of highly cellular lava known as _pumice stone_ is\r\nproduced. The action which thus takes place is not unlike that which\r\noccurs during the raising of a lot of the dough from which bread is\r\nmade, where the carbonic acid gas which is formed during the raising\r\nof the dough expands, and produces the well-known open cellular\r\nstructure of well-raised bread. In the case of pumice stone, however,\r\nthis raising goes on to such an extent that the mass consists often of\r\nless than 2% of solid matter, the remainder being a tangled mass of\r\nair.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LAVA FLOW OF THE CRATER OF KILAUEA, HAWAIIAN\r\nISLANDS _From a Stereograph, Copyright, by Underwood & Underwood_]\r\n\r\nFragments of lava that possess a cellular structure form what are\r\nknown as _scoriæ_. The lightest of all kinds of scoriæ is what is\r\nknown as _thread-lace scoriæ_. Here the thin walls consist of mere\r\nthreads. Figs. 26 and 27 represent the appearance of thread-lace\r\nscoriæ from Kilauea. The separate threads are very fine, being only\r\nfrom one-thirtieth to one-fortieth of an inch in thickness. As can be\r\nseen, this form of scoriæ have six-sided or hexagonal shapes. You can\r\nform some idea of the great lightness of such scoriæ when you learn\r\nthat they contain only 1.7% of rocky material. Indeed, they contain\r\nso little solid material that a layer of volcanic glass only one inch\r\nthick, if blown out into scoriæ, would be able to produce a layer\r\nsixty inches thick.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26. THREAD-LACE SCORIÆ FROM KILAUEA _From\r\nDana's Manual of Geology_]\r\n\r\nAnother curious form sometimes assumed by lava, especially in the\r\ncase of Kilauea, is where the lava is spun out in the form of long\r\nsilk-like hairs. This is called by the natives _Pele's hair_, after\r\nthe name of their goddess. Inasmuch as the origin of this form of lava\r\nwas at one time generally attributed to the action of the wind in\r\ndrawing out thread-like pieces from the jets of lava thrown upwards\r\nfrom the pool, it will be interesting if its true cause is explained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27. THREAD-LACE SCORIÆ FROM KILAUEA _From\r\nDana's Manual of Geology_]\r\n\r\nDutton, in his report on the Hawaiian volcanoes, refers to the\r\nformation of Pele's hair as follows:\r\n\r\n      \"The phenomenon of Pele's hair is often spoken of in the\r\n      school books, and receives its name from this locality.\r\n      It has generally been explained as the result of the\r\n      action of the wind upon minute threads of lava drawn out\r\n      by the spurting up of boiling lava. Nothing of the sort\r\n      was seen here, and yet Pele's hair was seen forming in\r\n      great abundance. Whenever the surface of the liquid lava\r\n      was exposed during the break-up the air above the lake was\r\n      filled with these cobwebs, but there was no spurting or\r\n      apparent boiling on the exposed surface. The explanation of\r\n      the phenomenon which I would offer is as follows: Liquid\r\n      lava coming up from the depths always contains more or\r\n      less water, which it gives off slowly and by degrees, in\r\n      much the same way as champagne gives off carbonic acid\r\n      when the bottle is uncorked. Water-vapor is held in the\r\n      liquid lava by some affinity similar to chemical affinity,\r\n      and though it escapes ultimately, yet it is surrendered\r\n      by the lava with reluctance so long as the lava remains\r\n      liquid. But when the lava solidifies the water is expelled\r\n      much more energetically, and the water-vapor separates\r\n      in the form of minute vesicles. Since the congelation of\r\n      all siliceous compounds is a passage free from a liquid\r\n      condition through an intermediate state of viscosity to\r\n      final solidity, the walls of these vesicles are capable of\r\n      being drawn out as in the case of glass. The commotion set\r\n      up by the descending crust produces eddies and numberless\r\n      currents in the surface of the lava. These vesicles are\r\n      drawn out on the surface of the current with exceeding\r\n      tenuity, producing myriads of minute filaments, and the\r\n      air, agitated by the intense heat at the surface of the\r\n      pool, readily lifts them and wafts them away. It forms\r\n      almost wholly at the time of the break-up. The air is then\r\n      full of it. Yet I saw no spouting or sputtering, but only\r\n      the eddying of the lava like water in the wake of a ship.\r\n      The country to the leeward of Kilauea shows an abundance\r\n      of Pele's hair, and it may be gathered by the barrelful. A\r\n      bunch of it is much like finely shredded asbestos.\"\r\n\r\nYou have probably often seen the beautiful frost pictures that collect\r\non the panes of glass in a room where the ventilation has been\r\nneglected. These pictures consist of groupings of ice crystals that\r\ncollect on the surface of the windows, when the moist vapor-laden\r\nair in the room is chilled by contact with their cold surfaces. Now\r\nthe crystals formed in cooling lavas are sometimes grouped in forms\r\nclosely resembling frost pictures. A few of such forms are represented\r\nin Figs. 28 and 29 in lava from Mt. Loa and Mt. Kea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28. FROST-LIKE LAVA CRYSTALS _From Dana's\r\nManual of Geology_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29. FROST-LIKE LAVA CRYSTALS _From Dana's\r\nManual of Geology_]\r\n\r\nCertain varieties of lava, especially that which is found in dikes,\r\nform cool, beautiful columns called basaltic columns. They are due to\r\nthe contraction that occurs on the cooling of the material. Instances\r\nof basaltic columns are seen in the Giant's Causeway, on the northern\r\ncoast of Ireland, as well as in the Isle of Cyclops on the coast of\r\nItaly. The general appearance of the latter is represented in Fig. 30.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30. BASALTIC COLUMNS, ISLE OF CYCLOPS,\r\nITALY]\r\n\r\nIt is a curious fact that the entire mass of basalt does not generally\r\ntake the columnous form but only certain layers which terminate\r\nsuddenly above and below at structureless masses of basalt, as shown\r\nin Fig. 31. These columns, however, are always found at right angles\r\nto the cooling surfaces as seen in the figures. They may, therefore,\r\nbe inclined at all angles to the horizon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31. COLUMNAR AND NON-COLUMNAR BASALT]\r\n\r\nWhen molten lava is only thrown up a short distance into the air\r\nfrom a crater it is still partially molten when on falling it again\r\nreaches the earth, and therefore clings to any surface on which it\r\nfalls. There are thus built up curious cones known as _driblet cones_,\r\nin which the separate drops covering the sides of the cone can be\r\ndistinctly traced. Driblet cones are represented in Figs. 32 and 33.\r\nHere, as can be seen, the separate drops can be readily traced as they\r\nrun down a short distance before cooling.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGS. 32, 33. DRIBLET CONES _From Dana's\r\nManual of Geology_]\r\n\r\nWe have already referred briefly to the _lava caves_ or _grottoes_,\r\nthat are formed in some of the lava streams issuing from Vesuvius,\r\nEtna, or Hawaii. These caves consist either of a number of\r\ncommunicating huge bubbles, or of the tunnels that are formed in the\r\nlava by the hardening of the outside of the lava streams as they flow\r\ndown the sides of the mountain, and towards the close of the eruption\r\nare afterwards emptied by the molten lava within continuing to flow to\r\na lower level before solidifying. Now, in the interior of these caves,\r\nthere are often found on the walls, as well as on the portions of the\r\nfloors of the caves, immediately below them, curious pendants, like\r\nicicles, or, more correctly, like the _stalactites of limestone_ that\r\nare seen hanging to the walls of caves in limestone districts, where\r\nthey are formed as follows: as the rain water sinks through limestone\r\nstrata it dissolves some of the lime, when, slowly falling, drop after\r\ndrop, from the roofs of the caverns, small particles of lime are\r\ndeposited on the roof, and in this manner a pendant of limestone is\r\nformed. The water that falls to the floor of the causeway immediately\r\nbelow, also builds up a dome-like hillock called a stalagmite. In due\r\ntime the pillar reaches downwards, and the opposite hillock upwards\r\nuntil the two meet, thus forming great natural pillars that appear\r\nto hold up the roof of the vast cave in which they have been slowly\r\nformed. A number of _lava stalactites_ are represented in Fig. 34.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34. LAVA STALACTITES _From Dana's Manual\r\nof Geology_]\r\n\r\nNow, in a similar manner these lava stalactites, formed in the lava\r\ncaves or grottoes, are caused by the stream as it escapes from the\r\nwalls of the caves depositing on them stalactites of various lava\r\nminerals it has dissolved as it slowly passed through them.\r\n\r\nBut the most important of all volcanic products is _volcanic dust_.\r\nThis, as we have seen, is so light that it remains longest in the air,\r\nand is often carried by the winds to great distances from the volcano\r\nfrom which it escaped. It may interest you to know that some of the\r\nmost fruitful of the great wheat fields of the western parts of the\r\nUnited States owe their extraordinary fertility to immense deposits\r\nof volcanic dust that have been thrown out from some of the great\r\nvolcanoes of the geological past, now found in an extinct condition in\r\nthese parts of the United States.\r\n\r\nAccording to Russell, immense deposits of volcanic dust are spread\r\nover vast areas in Montana, Southern Dakota, Nebraska, and Kansas, as\r\nwell as over parts of Oregon, and Washington, and, indeed, over large\r\nareas of southwestern Canada and Alaska.\r\n\r\nIt is practically certain that many of the eruptions producing this\r\ndust occurred within historic times. There must, therefore, have been\r\nmany times in these parts of our country when the dense ash clouds\r\nhiding the sun turned the day into night and destroyed the forests and\r\nother vegetation by showers of red hot ashes. There were produced,\r\ntoo, the same great dread, and possibly loss of life as common during\r\nhistorical eruptions. It is pleasing, however, to think that while\r\nthese great catastrophes brought suffering and dread to the people who\r\nthen lived on the earth, they were, nevertheless, but the forerunners\r\nof those fruitful fields that at a much later age were to bless the\r\npeople who afterwards lived on them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nMUD VOLCANOES AND HOT SPRINGS\r\n\r\n\r\nMud volcanoes are the more or less conical hillocks from which, under\r\ncertain conditions, mud is thrown out through the crust of the earth.\r\n\r\nGeikie defines mud volcanoes as follows:\r\n\r\n      \"Conical hills formed by the accumulation of fine and\r\n      usually saline (salty) mud, which, with various gases, is\r\n      continuously or intermittently given out from the orifice\r\n      or crater in the centre. They occur in groups, each hillock\r\n      being sometimes less than a yard in height, but ranging up\r\n      to elevations of 100 feet or more. Like true volcanoes,\r\n      they have their periods of repose, when either no discharge\r\n      takes place at all, or mud oozes out tranquilly from the\r\n      crater, and their periods of activity, when large volumes\r\n      of gas, and sometimes columns of flame, rush out with\r\n      considerable violence and explosion, and throw up mud and\r\n      stones to a height of several hundred feet.\"\r\n\r\nThere are two kinds of mud volcanoes: those in which the mud is thrown\r\nout by the action of different kinds of gases, and those in which the\r\nmud is thrown out by the action of steam.\r\n\r\nMud volcanoes may or not be volcanic phenomena. Those which occur in\r\nthe neighborhood of volcanoes whether active, dormant, or extinct, are\r\nprobably of volcanic origin. There are others, however, which occur\r\nin regions far removed from volcanoes. These are probably due not to\r\nvolcanoes, but to chemical action and the eruptions are caused by the\r\naction of gases.\r\n\r\nThe gases producing these eruptions are either carbonic acid gas\r\n(the gas that is given off from soda water); carburetted hydrogen\r\n(the gas that is sometimes seen escaping from the bottom of marshy\r\nground); sulphuretted hydrogen (a gas that is given off from rotten or\r\ndecomposing eggs, and possessing the characteristic odor of decayed\r\neggs) and nitrogen gas derived from the atmosphere. In mud volcanoes\r\nof the gaseous type the mud is generally cold, and the water salty. In\r\nthis latter case the mud volcanoes are also called _salses_. Daubeny\r\nhas pointed out that the mud volcanoes of this class that occur in the\r\nneighborhood of Sicily are due to the slow burning or oxidation of\r\nbeds of sulphur.\r\n\r\nMud volcanoes which eject hot mud by the force of eruption of steam,\r\nwhich occur in volcanic districts, are of volcanic origin. They are\r\ncaused by the passage of hot water and steam through beds of volcanic\r\nrock such as tufa, or hardened volcanic mud and other volcanic\r\nproducts. The hot water or steam raises the temperature of the mud\r\nthrough which it passes to the boiling point. As Dana remarks, the mud\r\nvaries in consistency from very liquid muddy water to a thick mass\r\nlike boiling soap, or in some cases like masses of mud or paint, and,\r\nin still other cases, to material like soft mortar, the consistency of\r\nthe mud varying with the dryness of the season.\r\n\r\nThere are three regions where mud volcanoes are especially common.\r\nOne of the best known is in the Yellowstone National Park, four miles\r\nnorth of Yellowstone Lake, and six miles from Crater Hill. Some of\r\nthese mud volcanoes have circular craters about ten feet in depth\r\naround which they have built mounds, the rims of which are several\r\nfeet above the general level.\r\n\r\nThere are well-known regions of mud volcanoes in different parts of\r\nIceland. Here, according to Lyell, they occur in many of the valleys\r\nwhere sulphur vapor and steam bursts from fissures in the ground with\r\na loud hissing noise. In these regions there are pools of boiling\r\nwater filled with a bluish black clay-like paste, that is kept\r\nviolently boiling. Huge bubbles, fifteen feet or more in diameter,\r\nrise from the surface of the boiling mass. The volcanoes pile up the\r\nmud around the sides of their craters or basins.\r\n\r\nAnother part of the world where mud volcanoes are especially numerous\r\nis on the western shores of the Caspian Sea at a place called Baku.\r\nThese are of the gaseous type and are attended by flames that blaze\r\nup to great heights often for several hours. These flames are due to\r\nthe presence of natural gas and petroleum vapor that pass out through\r\nthe water. Large quantities of mud are thrown out from the craters of\r\nthese mud volcanoes.\r\n\r\nThere are also many mud volcanoes in a district in India about 120\r\nmiles northwest of Cutch near the mouth of the Indus. In this region\r\nthe cone built up around the crater is sometimes as high as 400 feet.\r\n\r\nThe following description of mud volcanoes on Java is quoted from\r\nDaubeny's book on volcanoes.\r\n\r\n      \"It would appear likewise from Dr. Horsfield's description,\r\n      that Java exhibits phenomena of a similar kind to those\r\n      noticed in Sicily and at the foot of the Apennines, and\r\n      there known under the name of 'Salses.' In the calcareous\r\n      district (which I suspect to belong to the same class\r\n      of formations as the blue clay and tertiary limestone\r\n      of Sicily) occur a number of hot springs, containing in\r\n      solution a large quantity of calcareous earth, which\r\n      incrusts the surface of the ground near it. Of these, some\r\n      are much mixed with petroleum, and others highly saline.\r\n\r\n      \"The latter are dispersed through a district of country\r\n      consisting of limestone, several miles in circumference.\r\n      They are of considerable number, and force themselves\r\n      upwards through apertures in the rocks with some violence\r\n      and ebullition. The waters are strongly impregnated with\r\n      muriate of soda, and yield upon evaporation very good salt\r\n      for culinary purposes (not less than 200 tons in the year).\r\n\r\n      \"About the centre of this limestone district is found an\r\n      extraordinary volcanic phenomenon. On approaching the\r\n      spot from a distance, it is first discovered by a large\r\n      volume of smoke rising and disappearing at intervals of a\r\n      few seconds, resembling the vapors arising from a violent\r\n      surf, whilst a dull noise is heard like that of distant\r\n      thunder. Having advanced so near that the vision was no\r\n      longer impeded by the smoke, a large hemispherical mass was\r\n      observed, consisting of black earth mixed with water, about\r\n      sixteen feet in diameter, rising to the height of twenty or\r\n      thirty feet in a perfectly regular manner, and, as it were,\r\n      pushed up by a force beneath, which suddenly exploded with\r\n      a dull noise, and scattered about a volume of black mud\r\n      in every direction. After an interval of two or three, or\r\n      sometimes four or five seconds, the hemispherical body of\r\n      mud or earth rose and exploded again.\r\n\r\n      \"In the same manner this volcanic ebullition goes on\r\n      without interruption, throwing up a globular mass of mud,\r\n      and dispersing it with violence through the neighboring\r\n      places. The spot where the ebullition occurs is nearly\r\n      circular and perfectly level; it is covered with only the\r\n      earthy particles impregnated with salt water, which are\r\n      thrown up from below; its circumference may be estimated\r\n      at about half an English mile. In order to conduct the\r\n      salt water to the circumference, small passages or gutters\r\n      are made in the loose muddy earth, which lead it to the\r\n      borders, where it is collected in holes dug in the ground\r\n      for the purpose of evaporation.\r\n\r\n      \"A strong, pungent, sulphurous smell, somewhat resembling\r\n      that of earth-oil (naphtha), is perceived on standing near\r\n      the site of the explosion, and the mud recently thrown\r\n      up possesses a degree of heat greater than that of the\r\n      surrounding atmosphere. During the rainy season these\r\n      explosions are more violent, the mud is thrown up much\r\n      higher, and the noise is heard at a greater distance.\r\n\r\n      \"This volcanic phenomenon is situated near the centre of\r\n      the large plain, which interrupts the great series of\r\n      volcanoes, and owes its origin to the same general cause as\r\n      that of the numerous eruptions met with in this island.\"\r\n\r\nThere are, in many parts of the world, springs, whose waters issue\r\nfrom their reservoirs at temperatures either at or near the boiling\r\npoint of water. These are called _hot_ or _thermal springs_. Hot\r\nsprings are found both in volcanic regions, as well as in regions\r\nwhere there are no volcanoes, but where there are lines of deep\r\nfissures or faults. According to Dana, in both of these classes, the\r\ncause is to be traced to heat of volcanic or deep subterranean origin.\r\nHot springs are also found in regions where there are no volcanoes.\r\nIn these cases the heat is due to the gradual oxidation of various\r\nsulphide ores, or to some other chemical action.\r\n\r\nThe waters of hot or thermal springs almost always contain various\r\nmineral substances in solution. All spring water contains some little\r\ndissolved mineral matter, but in hot springs the quantity of this\r\nmatter is greater than in cold springs, because hot water can dissolve\r\nmineral substances much better than can cold water.\r\n\r\nIt might surprise you to hear that one of the commonest substances\r\nthat is found in solution in the waters of many hot springs is silica;\r\nfor silica is practically sand, and sand does not easily dissolve in\r\nwater as does sugar. The very hot water, however, which comes from\r\nthe hot spring, whose temperature below the earth's surface is very\r\nmuch higher than it is when it comes out of the spring, possesses\r\nthe power of readily dissolving silica from the rocks over which it\r\nflows. When the waters of such springs reach the surface the silica\r\nis deposited in a solid condition around the outlets of the springs.\r\nIn this way there are built up craters or mounds, or, more correctly,\r\ncrater-shaped basins.\r\n\r\nSometimes the hot water contains calcareous substances dissolved in\r\nit, the solution being caused not only by reason of the hot water, but\r\nalso by means of the carbonic gas it contains. When this water flows\r\nfrom the springs, it builds up the same crater-shaped mounds, only in\r\nthis case the mounds are of lime instead of silica.\r\n\r\nThere are peculiar kinds of hot springs called _geysers_, that possess\r\nthe power of throwing huge streams of water up into the air at more or\r\nless regular intervals. The word geyser is an Icelandic word meaning\r\nto rage, or snort, or gush, the name being given by reason of the\r\nmanner in which the waters rush violently out during an eruption.\r\n\r\nAs Dana points out, when the water in a basin of a hot spring merely\r\nboils, whether this boiling is nearly continuous, or the water is\r\nalternately boiling and quiet, the spring is called a hot or thermal\r\nspring, but where the water is thrown violently out at more or less\r\nregular intervals, it is called a geyser.\r\n\r\nThe cause of the eruption of a geyser was discovered by Professor\r\nBunsen, the celebrated German chemist, after a careful study of\r\nthe geyser regions in Iceland. The waters of geysers contain large\r\nquantities of either silica or lime in solution. Bunsen traced the\r\ncause of these curious eruptions to be the manner in which the hot\r\nsprings pile up cones of silica or limestone around their mouths.\r\n\r\nThe water of a geyser generally issues from the top of a more or less\r\nconical hillock, reaching the surface through a funnel-shaped tube.\r\nBoth the tube and the basin are covered with a smooth coating of\r\nsilica or limestone. In the case of the Great Geyser in Iceland, the\r\nbasin is over fifty feet high and seventy-five feet deep. Both the\r\ntube and the basin have been slowly deposited by the hot water of the\r\ngeyser.\r\n\r\nIt is only when the tube of a geyser has reached a certain depth that\r\nthe geyser is able to erupt. Moreover, as soon as this tube passes a\r\ncertain depth the geyser can no longer erupt and forever afterwards\r\nbecomes an ordinary hot spring. There are, therefore, to be found in\r\nmost geyser regions, a number of what might be called young geysers or\r\nmerely hot springs, that are not yet deep enough to erupt; others that\r\nhave just commenced eruption, others that have reached their prime,\r\nwhile others that, old and decrepit, have again merely become hot\r\nsprings.\r\n\r\nLet us now try to understand the cause of the eruption of a geyser.\r\nBunsen's explanation, which is now generally accepted, is as follows:\r\n\r\nThe heat of the volcanic strata through which the tube of the geyser\r\nextends, gradually raises the temperature of the water that fills\r\nthe geyser tube. Since the boiling point of a liquid increases with\r\nthe pressure to which it is subjected, far down in the tube of a\r\ngeyser, the pressure arising from the weight of the water above it is\r\nsufficiently great to prevent the water from beginning to boil until\r\nit reaches a temperature far higher than that at which it would boil\r\nin the upper parts of the tube. Suppose now, when the water in the\r\nfunnel-shaped tube is nearly filled to the top, the water at last\r\ngrows hot enough to begin boiling at some point near the middle of\r\nthe tube. The pressure of the steam driven off from this portion of\r\nthe water raises the column of water above it in the tube and begins\r\nto empty it out of the top of the geyser. All the water below this\r\npoint being thus suddenly relieved of its pressure, and being now much\r\nhotter than is necessary to boil the water at that decreased pressure,\r\nsuddenly flashes into steam, and violently shoots out all the water\r\nabove it to a height that in some cases may be as great as 100 to 200\r\nfeet. The steam causes this eruption, then rushes out with a roar, and\r\nthe geyser eruption is over.\r\n\r\nProfessor Tyndall in his charming book entitled \"Heat as a Mode of\r\nMotion\" speaks as follows concerning Professor Bunsen's discovery:\r\n\r\n      \"Previous to an eruption, both the tube and basin are\r\n      filled with hot water; detonations which shake the ground,\r\n      are heard at intervals, and each is succeeded by a violent\r\n      agitation of the water in the basin. The water in the\r\n      pipe is lifted up so as to form an eminence in the middle\r\n      of the basin, and an overflow is the consequence. These\r\n      detonations are evidently due to the production of steam in\r\n      the ducts which feed the geyser tube, which steam escaping\r\n      into the cooler water of the tube is there suddenly\r\n      condensed, and produces the explosions. Professor Bunsen\r\n      succeeded in determining the temperature of the geyser\r\n      tube, from top to bottom, a few minutes before a great\r\n      eruption; and these observations revealed the extraordinary\r\n      fact that at no part of the tube did the water reach its\r\n      boiling point. In the sketch [not reproduced] I have given\r\n      on one side the temperatures actually observed, and on\r\n      the other side the temperatures at which water would boil,\r\n      taking into account both the pressure of the atmosphere and\r\n      the pressure of the superincumbent column of water. The\r\n      nearest approach to the boiling point is at A, a height of\r\n      30 feet from the bottom; but even here the water is 2° C.,\r\n      or more than 3-1/2° F., below the temperature at which it\r\n      could boil. How then is it possible that an eruption could\r\n      occur under such circumstances?\r\n\r\n      \"Fix your attention upon the water at the point A, where\r\n      the temperature is within 2° C. of the boiling point. Call\r\n      to mind the lifting of the column when the detonations\r\n      are heard. Let us suppose that by the entrance of steam\r\n      from the ducts near the bottom of the tube, the geyser\r\n      column is elevated six feet, a height quite within the\r\n      limits of actual observation; the water at A is thereby\r\n      transferred to B. Its boiling point at A is 123.8°, and\r\n      its actual temperature 121.8°; but at B its boiling point\r\n      is only 120.8°, hence, when transferred from A to B the\r\n      heat which it possesses is in excess of that necessary to\r\n      make it boil. This excess of heat is instantly applied to\r\n      the generation of steam: the column is thus lifted higher,\r\n      and the water below is further relieved. More steam is\r\n      generated; from the middle downwards the mass suddenly\r\n      bursts into ebullition, the water above, mixed with steam\r\n      clouds, is projected into the atmosphere, and we have the\r\n      geyser eruption in all its grandeur.\r\n\r\n      \"By its contact with the air the water is cooled, falls\r\n      back into the basin, partially refills the tube, in which\r\n      it gradually rises, and finally fills the basin as before.\r\n      Detonations are heard at intervals, and risings of the\r\n      water in the basin. These are so many futile attempts at\r\n      an eruption, for not until the water in the tube comes\r\n      sufficiently near its boiling temperature, to make the\r\n      lifting of the column effective, can we have a true\r\n      eruption.\"\r\n\r\nThe principal geyser regions of the world are in Iceland, in New\r\nZealand, and in the Yellowstone National Park in the United States.\r\n\r\nThere are several geyser regions in Iceland. The best known lies in\r\nthe neighborhood of Mt. Hecla. Here is a great geyser that shoots up\r\na column of water to a height of about 100 feet every thirty hours.\r\nFig. 35 represents the appearance of the crater of the great geyser in\r\nIceland.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 35. CRATER OF THE GREAT GEYSER OF ICELAND]\r\n\r\nIt is a well-known fact that in geyser regions generally, the throwing\r\nof stones or other materials into the tube will frequently hasten an\r\neruption. This is probably due to the fact that the throwing in of\r\nthese things results in the raising of the water in the tube, thus\r\nhastening the eruption.\r\n\r\nThe New Zealand region is in the neighborhood of Lake Rotomahama in\r\nthe northern island.\r\n\r\nThe geyser region in the Yellowstone Park is by far the most\r\ninteresting of all geyser regions. This region is situated principally\r\naround Fire-Hole Fork of the Madison, and near Shoshone Lake at the\r\nhead of Lake Fork of the Snake River. There are many geysers in this\r\nregion, as well as simple hot springs. The temperature of their\r\nwaters varies from between 160° and 200° F. to the boiling point of\r\nwater at this elevation. As you are probably aware, water boils at\r\nthe temperature of 212° F. only under the condition of the ordinary\r\natmospheric pressure that exists at the level of the sea. At higher\r\nelevations, such as on the slopes of mountains, or on high plateaus,\r\nwater boils at a lower temperature. The height of the country in which\r\nthe Yellowstone Park is situated is so great that the water boils at\r\ntemperatures of from 198° to 199° F.\r\n\r\nThe conical hillock of geyser cones from which the waters flow assume\r\nvarious shapes, two of which are shown in Figs. 36 and 37.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 36. GIANT GEYSER _From Dana's Manual of\r\nGeology_]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 37. BEE HIVE _From Dana's Manual of\r\nGeology_]\r\n\r\nThat shown in Fig. 36 represents the shape of the cone of the giant\r\ngeyser in the upper geyser basin of the Fire-Hole, Yellowstone\r\nNational Park. This cone is about ten feet in height, and twenty-four\r\nfeet in diameter. As shown in the figure it is broken on one of its\r\nsides. It throws out, at long intervals, a column of water the height\r\nof which varies from ninety to 200 feet.\r\n\r\nFig. 38 represents the crater of a cone known as the Bee Hive in\r\neruption.\r\n\r\nBesides the above named geyser regions there is another region on the\r\nshores of Celebes, and a small region on San Miguel, in the Azores\r\nIslands, in the Atlantic Ocean.\r\n\r\nBesides hot springs and mud volcanoes there are two other phenomena\r\nconnected with volcanic action that we will now briefly describe.\r\n\r\nWhen eruptions take place and the lava begins to flow down the side\r\nof a mountain, the different vapors and gases with which the lava is\r\ncharged begin to escape or pass out from the boiling or fused mass.\r\nWhen these substances are of such a character that they produce fumes,\r\nor the vapors of various chemical substances, that become solid on\r\ncooling, they form what are called _fumaroles_, a word derived from\r\na Latin word meaning \"to smoke.\" For the greater part, fumaroles are\r\nfound on the edge of craters, but sometimes are found in cavernous\r\nplaces either in the crater or in the lava streams.\r\n\r\nThere is, still, another class of openings through which only\r\nsulphurous vapors escape. These are called _solfataras_, a word\r\nderived from the Italian word _solfo_, or sulphur. Solfataras are\r\ngenerally found in regions distant from volcanic action. In the\r\nmaterials that escape from recently ejected lava, or molten lava,\r\nthe temperature is high enough to volatilize many of the solid\r\ningredients. But where the temperature is low, only sulphur vapors are\r\ndriven off. It is for this reason that fumaroles are only found around\r\nthe craters of active volcanoes, or on the lines of cracks or crevices\r\nof the lava stream where the temperature is very high.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 38. BEE HIVE GEYSER OF ICELAND _From\r\nDana's Manual of Geology_]\r\n\r\nBesides water vapor and sulphurous vapors there are other substances\r\nthat escape from the earth in volcanic districts. Sulphurous acid,\r\ntogether with hydrogen and nitrogen escape from nearly all lava. At\r\nVesuvius chlorine gas is given off. This, however, as soon as it\r\npasses into the atmosphere becomes changed into hydrochloric acid.\r\nSulphurous acid is frequently changed into sulphuric acid, which,\r\ncombining with various substances, forms such materials as _gypsum_,\r\nor sulphate of lime, the chemical name for plaster of Paris; sulphate\r\nof soda or _Glauber's salt_; sodium chloride or _common table salt_;\r\nand _sal ammoniac_. You will remember in reading the description of\r\nVulcano, in the Grecian Archipelago, that some of these products were\r\ncollected at the chemical works that had been established on the\r\nvolcano.\r\n\r\nWhen a volcanic mountain is for the time being passing from an active\r\nto an extinct condition, it is sometimes said to be in the _fumarole\r\nstage_, since the presence of the fumaroles are the only indication\r\nof its activity. The volcanic heat is still great. When it reaches a\r\nstill greater decline, the fumaroles disappear, and only solfataras\r\nare left. The amount of heat is now only sufficient to produce sulphur\r\nvapors and the vapor of water. This is called the _solfatara stage_.\r\n\r\nOf course, as we have already pointed out, fumaroles and solfataras\r\nmay occur in the neighborhood of a volcano at different distances from\r\nits crater.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nTHE VOLCANOES OF THE MOON\r\n\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that the moon was once the seat of very great\r\nvolcanic activity. It was formerly believed that the very many\r\nvolcanic craters which can be seen on its surface when it is examined\r\nby a comparatively small telescope, were all extinct. While this\r\nis nearly true, yet recent investigations have shown that in all\r\nprobability a feeble volcanic activity still exists in a few of these\r\ncraters.\r\n\r\nThe distinctness with which the surface of the moon is seen does not\r\ndepend so much on the size of the telescope employed, as it does\r\non the steadiness of the atmosphere when the telescope is being\r\nused. When one wishes to examine a very distant body like a star,\r\nit is necessary to use a powerful telescope, but in the case of a\r\ncomparatively near body, like one of the planets or the moon, a big\r\ntelescope is not necessary. It is, however, necessary to make the\r\nobservations at some time of the year, or in some part of the world,\r\nwhen the air is apt to be free from winds.\r\n\r\nA person on the earth's surface looking at the heavenly bodies through\r\na telescope is practically in the position in which he would be were\r\nhe at the bottom of the water in a large lake looking up through the\r\nwater at some body in the heavens. He would have no difficulty in\r\nseeing such a body distinctly as long as the upper surface of the\r\nwater remained quiet, and unruffled by waves. As soon, however, as\r\nwaves were set up, the images seen in the telescope are so distorted\r\nas to become practically worthless. It is for this reason that it is\r\ncustomary to build great astronomical observatories in parts of the\r\nworld where there are apt to be many days in the year when the air is\r\nalmost entirely free from wind.\r\n\r\nSince the atmosphere is apt to be disturbed by winds in both the\r\ntemperate and the polar latitudes, these parts of the world are\r\nnot very satisfactory as sites for astronomical observatories. The\r\nconditions are more favorable near the equator, since, although at\r\ncertain seasons of the year there are very severe storms in these\r\nregions, yet there are quite long periods when the air is almost\r\nentirely free from winds.\r\n\r\nIt is for this reason that Harvard University has erected an\r\nastronomical observatory at Arequipa, Peru, at an elevation of 8,000\r\nfeet above the level of the Pacific Ocean. Here, with a comparatively\r\nsmall object glass, of about twelve inches aperture, magnificent\r\nphotographs have been obtained not only of the moon but also of the\r\nplanet Mars.\r\n\r\nAccording to Professor Pickering, from whose magnificent work,\r\nentitled, \"The Moon,\" much of the information in this chapter has been\r\nobtained, the moon, which is generally spoken of as a satellite of the\r\nearth, ought rather to be called the earth's twin planet. Although the\r\nmoon appears to revolve in a small elliptical orbit around the earth\r\nit should properly be said to revolve around the sun; for, together\r\nwith the earth, it revolves around the sun once every year. As seen\r\nfrom any of the planets that lie near the earth the earth and moon\r\nwould appear as a very beautiful double star.\r\n\r\nIn order the more readily to understand what will be said shortly\r\nconcerning the origin of the moon, it may be mentioned that the\r\nmoon's diameter is 2,163 miles, or a little more than one-fourth the\r\ndiameter of our earth.\r\n\r\nYou will, most probably, be surprised to learn that the origin of the\r\nmoon is believed to be very different from the origin of the moons\r\nor satellites of Jupiter, Saturn, and the other planets. As we have\r\nalready seen, according to the nebular hypothesis, all the planets\r\nexcept the earth probably had their moons formed from the rings that\r\nwere left surrounding them when they shrunk on cooling to their\r\npresent dimensions. Such a ring is still to be seen surrounding Saturn.\r\n\r\nNow it is believed that our moon was formed in a different manner.\r\nIt was not thrown off from the earth while the latter was in a\r\nhighly fluid or gaseous condition, but after the earth had shrunken\r\nto nearly its present size and, most probably, after a solid crust\r\nhad been formed on its surface. In order that our earth should be\r\nable to violently throw off a large portion of its mass, it is only\r\nnecessary that at the time this separation occurred, its motion of\r\nrotation on its axis was sufficiently great to enable it to make one\r\ncomplete revolution in rather less than three hours instead of in\r\nthe twenty-four hours it now requires. At this velocity of rotation,\r\nobjects would fly off the earth in the neighborhood of the equator,\r\nunder the influence of the high centrifugal force. Let us, then,\r\nendeavor to see if it was at all probable that the earth ever did turn\r\nso rapidly on its axis.\r\n\r\nYou all probably know that it is principally the attraction of the\r\nmoon that produces the earth's tides. Of course, the sun also produces\r\ntides on the earth, but it is so far off from the earth that not\r\nwithstanding its greater mass the tides it forms are much smaller\r\nthan those produced by the moon. You also know that the moon produces\r\nat the same time two tides in every twenty-four hours, on directly\r\nopposite sides of the earth; one on the side immediately under the\r\nmoon, and the other on the side furthest from the moon. As the earth\r\nrotates between these two tides, they act as a break which serves to\r\nimpede its motion. Every high tide, therefore, tends to make the earth\r\nrotate more slowly, and thus to slowly increase the length of the day.\r\nFor this reason to-day is a trifle longer than yesterday, and still\r\nlonger than a day a hundred years ago.\r\n\r\nYou must not suppose for a moment that this increase in the length of\r\nthe day is large. On the contrary, it is so small that since the year\r\nA. D. 1, up to the present time, the day is only a very small\r\nfraction of a second longer.\r\n\r\nBut it was very different in the earth's geological past, when the\r\ninside of the earth was in a molten condition; for then great tides\r\nwere set up in the melted interior of the earth that not only greatly\r\nchanged the shape of the earth, but decreased the rate of rotation\r\nmuch more rapidly than it does when the earth's tides are limited as\r\nthey are now to the waters on the earth's surfaces.\r\n\r\nThere was, however, at the same time, something going on that tended\r\ngreatly to make the earth turn more rapidly on its axis. While the\r\noriginally melted earth was cooling and shrinking, the rate of\r\nits rotation was necessarily increasing. As you know, the time of\r\nvibration of a pendulum, that is, the time it requires to make one\r\ncomplete to-and-fro motion, is shorter the shorter the length of the\r\npendulum. A pendulum two feet long moves to and fro more slowly than\r\na pendulum one foot in length. In the same way a rotating sphere will\r\nmake one complete rotation in a shorter time when its radius, which\r\ncorresponds to the length of a pendulum, is shorter. Therefore, as the\r\nearth shrunk, it rotated more and more rapidly, and at last reached a\r\nrapidity of motion at which an immense quantity of matter flew off\r\nits surface nearest the equator and went out into space, never again\r\nto return. It was this mass that constituted the earth's moon.\r\n\r\nNecessarily such a tremendous catastrophe was attended by an\r\nearthquake as well as by the most fearful volcanic phenomena that\r\nthe earth has ever witnessed. The terrible catastrophe produced by\r\nthe explosive eruption of Krakatoa was but as a small drop of rain\r\nfalling on the earth, when compared with the catastrophe produced when\r\nthe \"five thousand million cubic miles of material left the earth's\r\nsurface, never again to return to it.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not known whether this matter was torn off the earth at a single\r\ntime or during successive times, but quoting the beautiful language of\r\nProfessor Pickering:\r\n\r\n      \"We may try in vain to imagine the awful uproar and fearful\r\n      volcanic phenomena exhibited when a planet was cleft in\r\n      twain, and a new planet was born into the solar system.\"\r\n\r\nThis terrible catastrophe took place at a time not when the earth was\r\na gaseous mass, but when it had condensed into a comparatively small\r\nmass not much larger than it is at its present time, and possibly\r\neven after it had hardened sufficiently to form a solid crust on its\r\noutside.\r\n\r\nIf you look at a map of the earth on a Mercator's projection, such,\r\nfor example, as that employed in illustrating the distribution of the\r\nworld's volcanoes in Fig. 24, you can see, even without any very close\r\nexamination, that the great water area of the Atlantic Ocean has its\r\neastern and western shores almost parallel to each other, so that\r\nif you conceive the Eastern and Western Continents as being pushed\r\ntogether, they would, except at the south, almost completely fit\r\ntogether, and the same thing is true, if Greenland is pushed towards\r\nthe northeastern coast of North America. Of course, some portions of\r\nthe coast would not fit exactly, but then these portions might either\r\nhave been worn away, or, as is more probable, have been changed in\r\nshape by the deposit of immense beds of sedimentary rocks spread over\r\nthe borders of the Atlantic by the great rivers that empty into it.\r\nThis is so remarkable a fact that it will be well worth your while to\r\nturn to the map mentioned and convince yourself of the proof of what\r\nI have just said. As you will see, Europe and Africa would almost\r\nexactly fit against South America and North America, while Greenland\r\nwould even more closely fit against the northeastern coast of North\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nNow, while we do not say that it was so, it has been suggested as just\r\npossible that the great depression of the Pacific Ocean represents the\r\nspot that was once filled by the moon. That the Eastern and Western\r\nContinents, then torn asunder by the great force of the convulsion,\r\nwere left floating on the surface of a sea of molten matter, a greatly\r\nwidened crack marking positions they assumed at the end of this\r\ncataclysm.\r\n\r\nOf course, you must understand that all this is a mere supposition,\r\nand that we do not know whether the earth was actually cooled on the\r\noutside when this occurred, since it might have still been in a liquid\r\ncondition throughout. It would seem, however, to have occurred rather\r\nrecently, since it could not have occurred until the earth shrunk so\r\nmuch that it became so small in radius as to acquire a very rapid rate\r\nof motion on its axis.\r\n\r\nIt is an interesting fact that we are, perhaps, better acquainted with\r\nthat side of the moon which is turned towards us than we are with the\r\nsurface of the earth on which we live. Of course, I do not mean in the\r\nsmall details of the moon's surface, but with such portions as can be\r\nseen through a good telescope when the air is quiet. While there are\r\nno parts of the moon's surface that have not been carefully examined\r\nin detail probably thousands of times by acute astronomers, there are\r\nstill comparatively large areas of the earth that have never been once\r\ntrodden by civilized man.\r\n\r\nWhen I speak of all parts of the moon's surface, I only mean those\r\nparts that are turned towards us. You may possibly be ignorant of the\r\nfact that the moon always turns exactly the same face towards the\r\nearth. Not only has no man ever seen the opposite side of the moon,\r\nbut he never can hope to see it while he remains on the earth. This is\r\nbecause the moon turns or rotates on its axis in exactly the same time\r\nthat it revolves in its orbit.\r\n\r\nWhen I say that the time of rotation is the same as the time of\r\nrevolution of the moon, I do not mean that it is almost the same, but\r\nthat it is exactly the same. If it differed even but a small fraction\r\nof a second, a time would come when we would be able to see the other\r\nside of the moon. Now, since astronomers have made careful pictures\r\nof the moon, many, many years ago, we can see by comparing them\r\nwith photographs taken at the present time there has been no change\r\nwhatever in that face of the moon which is turned towards us, and\r\nthis, of course, proves beyond question, that the time of the moon's\r\nrotation during this great period has remained exactly the same as the\r\ntime of its revolution.\r\n\r\nIt may possibly seem to you that it cannot be a matter of great\r\nimportance in a book like this on the Wonders of Volcanoes and\r\nEarthquakes, whether or not the moon always turns its face towards\r\nthe earth; on the contrary, it is a matter of the greatest importance\r\nsince by it we can prove positively that the moon was at one time at\r\nleast in a partly fluid condition. It was the presence of this partly\r\nfluid interior that resulted in the time of the moon's rotation\r\nagreeing exactly with the time of its revolution. The tides of the\r\nearth set up in the moon's molten interior, tides, that instead of\r\nreaching twice every day the height of a few feet only, were set up\r\nin the molten mass in the moon's interior, probably reaching miles in\r\nheight, rapidly decreased the time of the moon's rotation until the\r\nmoon rotated once only during every complete revolution.\r\n\r\nEven now that the moon is probably solid throughout, the time of its\r\nrotation and revolution exactly agree because, while in a molten\r\ncondition, the action of the earth changed its shape from that of an\r\nexact sphere to a spheroid, with its longest axis in the direction of\r\nthe earth. Even, therefore, if the moon at any time began to rotate\r\nfaster than the earth, the earth acting on its projecting surface\r\nretarded it until the time of its rotation agreed exactly with the\r\ntime of its revolution.\r\n\r\nIt was at one time believed that the moon had no atmosphere. It is\r\nnow known, however, that it has an atmosphere. It is true this is a\r\nrare atmosphere, probably not greater in density than the one-ten\r\nthousandth of the earth's atmosphere. This important question was\r\nsettled once for all on August 12th, 1892, at the Harvard Observatory\r\nat Arequipa, Peru, when a photograph was taken of an object on the\r\nmoon. It could be readily seen on examining this photograph that the\r\nlight coming from the moon experienced a bending, known as refraction,\r\nin passing from the space outside the moon to its atmosphere on to its\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nOf course, when the moon was thrown off from the earth by reason of\r\nits great centrifugal force, it carried along with it a portion of the\r\nearth's atmosphere. But since the quantity of matter in the moon is\r\nonly about one-eightieth of that of the earth, the force of gravity\r\non the moon is much smaller than that on the earth, being almost\r\nexactly one-sixth that of the earth's gravity. In other words, if you\r\ncould succeed in reaching the moon's surface, you would only weigh\r\none-sixth of what you weigh on the earth, but then you could carry a\r\nweight six times heavier with no greater effort, and, as for running,\r\njumping, and other athletic exercises, the surface of the moon would,\r\nindeed, be a great place on which to break records, since one could\r\nreadily jump six times higher, put the shot six times further, than\r\non the earth, or go through most other athletic exercises with a\r\ncorresponding increase.\r\n\r\nWithout going any further into this question it will be sufficient\r\nto say that the moon's present atmosphere is believed to consist of\r\ncarbonic acid gas, and that while on the general surface of the moon\r\nthis atmosphere must be very rare, yet, at the bottom of the great\r\nfissures that cross the moon's surface, it may possess a fairly great\r\ndensity, especially if the moon still possesses feeble volcanic\r\nactivity; that carbonic acid gas is still being given off from the\r\ninside of the moon as we know it is being given off from inside the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nUnder the best conditions of atmosphere and telescope, we can see the\r\nmoon's surface as it would appear at a distance varying from 800 miles\r\nto 300 miles from the earth. With a fifteen-inch telescope, under\r\nperfect conditions of vision, objects can be seen as if they were at\r\na distance of 800 miles from the earth, and with the most powerful\r\nglasses, and the best conditions of atmosphere this distance can be\r\nreduced to about 300 miles. This would enable us to clearly see large\r\nobjects like rivers, lakes, seas, or forests, if they existed, but\r\nwould not be sufficient to enable us to see houses, buildings, or\r\nroads.\r\n\r\nWhen we come to examine the surface of the moon under the most\r\nfavorable conditions, we find that it is extremely irregular. There\r\nare plenty of high mountains. These mountains are not collected\r\nin ranges as they are on the earth's surface, but are completely\r\nseparated from each other, and are scattered in great numbers over the\r\nmoon's surface.\r\n\r\nYou may form some idea of the number of volcanoes that have been\r\nobserved on the moon when I tell you that as many as 32,000 have been\r\nseen on that side of the moon that is turned towards the earth.\r\n\r\nNow it is an interesting fact that almost all these mountains possess\r\ngreat craters that are not unlike some of the volcanic craters we see\r\non the earth. The volcanic craters of the moon, however, are of very\r\nmuch greater size than those on the earth, many being from fifty to\r\nsixty miles in diameter, while some of them are more than 100 miles\r\nin diameter. Smaller craters, say from twenty to twenty-five miles in\r\ndiameter, can be counted by the hundreds.\r\n\r\nLike most of the moon's craters, the largest crater more closely\r\nresembles one of the pit-craters or calderas on the island of Hawaii.\r\nThis volcanic crater consists of a huge circular ring with a small\r\nirregular peak that rises inside the ring. This peak, by the way,\r\nmight at first appear to resemble the crater of Vesuvius, which after\r\na long period of inactivity of the mountain during the eruption that\r\ndestroyed Pompeii and Herculaneum was thrown up inside of what had\r\nbeen left standing of the old crater of Somma. But it has no crater\r\nat its summit, and, therefore, resembles rather the irregular pile or\r\nrock that rises from the surface of a lava lake in the craters of Mt.\r\nLoa or Mt. Kilauea in Hawaii.\r\n\r\nBesides the numerous craters to be seen on the moon's surface there\r\nare many lines of deep, crooked valleys, known as _rills_, that may\r\nat one time have been the beds of rivers. Besides the rills, there are\r\nmany straight clefts about half a mile in width, that extend down into\r\nthe surface of the moon for unknown depths. These clefts can be seen\r\npassing directly through mountains and valleys. They are believed to\r\nbe cracks or fissures in the moon's surface.\r\n\r\nOn the moon is a great crater called Tycho. It is situated near the\r\nmoon's south pole. The great crater of Tycho is by far the most\r\nprominent object on the moon's surface. It has a system of rays that\r\nextend for great distances around its craters.\r\n\r\nYou will also see if you examine the moon's surface by a powerful\r\nglass that there are immense plains called _oceans_ or _seas_. By an\r\nappropriate custom the names of the different craters on the moon are\r\nthe same as the names of the great astronomers and philosophers that\r\nhave long since passed from their labors, such as Tycho, Copernicus,\r\nKepler, Plato, etc.\r\n\r\nVarious explanations have been given as to the origin of the craters\r\non the moon's surface, but without going into a discussion it may be\r\nsaid that they are now generally regarded as having been formed in the\r\nmain just as were the craters of the earth's volcanoes.\r\n\r\nThe tremendous size of the moon's craters is of course due to the\r\ngreat decrease in the force of gravity. This would make the craters,\r\napproximately, six times as great as the craters on the earth.\r\nProfessor Pickering points out that while the moon's craters resemble\r\nmore closely those of Hawaii than those of any other of the earth's\r\nvolcanoes, yet there is this difference in them: that while the\r\nearth's crater floors are generally considerably higher than the level\r\nof the sea, the moon's crater floors are generally below the level of\r\nthe surrounding country. Still, taking them all in all, the craters\r\nof the moon's volcanoes resemble those of the island of Hawaii, or\r\nagain quoting from Pickering:--\r\n\r\n      \"There seems, indeed, to be no feature found upon the moon\r\n      which is not presented by these Hawaiian volcanoes, there\r\n      is no feature of the volcanoes that does not also have its\r\n      counterpart in the moon.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nEARTHQUAKES\r\n\r\n\r\nAn _earthquake_ is a shaking of the earth. It may vary in intensity\r\nfrom a shaking so feeble that it requires the use of a delicate\r\ninstrument to detect it, to a shaking violent enough to overthrow\r\nheavy buildings, and even to make great rents or fissures in the crust.\r\n\r\nAn earthquake then is an _earth-shake_. It may be caused by anything\r\ncapable of shaking the earth; for example, as the falling of a heavy\r\nweight on its surface. Now, a shaking so caused is only felt in the\r\nimmediate neighborhood of the place the weight strikes the earth. On\r\nthe contrary, in an earthquake, the shaking spreads in all directions\r\nthrough the earth's crust, until, in the case of very violent\r\nearthquakes, it reaches portions that may be situated many thousands\r\nof miles away from where the shock started. This spreading of the\r\nearthquake waves through the solid earth is not unlike the spreading\r\nof the circular waves that are set up in a still water surface when a\r\nstone is tossed in.\r\n\r\nAny shaking of the earth's crust produces what may be called an\r\nearth-shake or earthquake. The mere falling of a raindrop on the earth\r\nproduces a slight shaking. The falling of a heavy stone produces a\r\nstronger shaking, and sets up a series of minute waves, generally\r\ncalled vibrations, that spread around the place in all directions from\r\nwhere the stone struck. These movements, however, while they spread\r\nin all directions, just as they do in a surface of a lake, when a\r\nstone is thrown into it, are of course much more quickly stopped by\r\nthe solid earth than similar movements are by the more readily movable\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nBut, while any shaking of the earth's crust constitutes an earthquake,\r\nyet, strictly speaking, an earthquake is produced only by some force\r\nthat acts suddenly on the earth, _at a point below its surface_, and,\r\ntherefore, out of sight. This, of course, would rule out all such\r\nshakings as are caused by bodies striking the outer surface of the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nEarthquakes may occur in any part of the world, and at any time of the\r\nday or year. They do occur, however, most frequently in certain parts\r\nof the world, at certain seasons of the year and at certain hours of\r\nthe day.\r\n\r\nEarthquakes are far from being unusual occurrences. In some parts of\r\nthe world, such as the island of Java, they are very common, and in\r\nJapan, under certain circumstances, scarcely a day passes without one\r\nor more shocks in some part of that little empire.\r\n\r\nProfessor Mallet, who has made a very extensive study of earthquakes,\r\npublished in 1850 to 1858, in the Philosophical Transactions, brief\r\nabstracts or descriptions of all the more important earthquakes he\r\ncould find records of during the past 3,456 years. The number of\r\nearthquakes thus recorded during this period reached 6,830. Of this\r\ngreat number nearly one-half occurred during the last fifty years.\r\n\r\nIt should not be inferred from the above figures that the number of\r\nearthquakes has really increased so greatly in the past half-century.\r\nThe explanation of the apparent increase is that greater care has\r\nbeen taken recently in recording earthquakes, and that an apparatus\r\ncalled a _seismometer_, or _earthquake-recorder_, has been invented\r\nwhich automatically produces a record of the smallest shocks; so that\r\na great many have been recorded that would otherwise have passed\r\nundetected.\r\n\r\nIt is the opinion of Le Conte that if the records of all the\r\nearthquakes of 3,456 years had been thus made there would have been\r\nfound during the entire time of Mallet's researches to have occurred\r\nno less than 200,000, while during the last four years of Mallet's\r\nrecords, the number would have probably reached two earthquakes per\r\nweek.\r\n\r\nSince Mallet's time, Prof. Alexis Perry published (1876) a much larger\r\nlist of earthquakes. Perry finds that from 1843 to 1872 there have\r\nbeen 17,249 earthquakes, or 575 every year. Perry's list, however,\r\nis incomplete, since it fails to record earthquakes that occurred in\r\nmid-ocean, and in the unexplored and uncivilized parts of the world.\r\nSo it seems likely that earthquakes are so common that our earth, at\r\nsome part or other of its surface, is continually shaking or quaking.\r\n\r\nEarthquakes are such tremendous phenomena that they were necessarily\r\nobserved by the ancients. We find more or less complete accounts of\r\nthem in various writings. Lucretius (Titus Carus Lucretius, a great\r\nRoman poet) speaks as follows, in his De Rerum Natura (On the Nature\r\nof Things). We use Munro's translation here:\r\n\r\n      \"Now mark and learn what the law of earthquakes is. And\r\n      first of all take for granted that the earth below us as\r\n      well as above is filled in all parts with windy caverns,\r\n      and bears within its bosom many lakes and many chasms,\r\n      cliffs and craggy rocks; and you must suppose that many\r\n      rivers hidden beneath the crust of the earth roll on with\r\n      violent waves and submerged stones; for the very nature\r\n      of the case requires it to be throughout like to itself.\r\n      With such things then attached and placed below, the\r\n      earth quakes above from the shock of great falling masses,\r\n      when underneath, time has undermined vast caverns. Whole\r\n      mountains, indeed, fall in, and in an instant from the\r\n      mighty shock tremblings spread themselves far and wide from\r\n      that centre. And with good cause, since buildings beside\r\n      a road tremble throughout, when shaken by a wagon of not\r\n      such very great weight; and they rock no less, where any\r\n      sharp pebble on the road jolts up the iron tires of the\r\n      wheels on both sides. Sometimes, too, when an enormous mass\r\n      of soil through age rolls down from the land into great\r\n      and extensive pools of water, the earth rocks and sways\r\n      with the undulation of the water just as a vessel at times\r\n      cannot rest, until the liquid within has ceased to sway\r\n      about in unsteady undulations....\r\n\r\n      \"The same great quaking likewise arises from this cause,\r\n      when on a sudden the wind and some enormous force of air\r\n      gathering either from without or within the earth have\r\n      flung themselves into the hollow of the earth and there\r\n      chafe at first with much uproar among the great caverns\r\n      and are carried on with a whirling motion, and when their\r\n      force, afterwards stirred and lashed into fury, bursts\r\n      abroad and at the same moment cleaves the deep earth and\r\n      opens up a great yawning chasm. This fell out in Syrian\r\n      Sidon and took place at Ægium in the Peloponnese, two towns\r\n      which an outbreak of wind of this sort and the ensuing\r\n      earthquake threw down. And many walled places besides fell\r\n      down by great commotions on land and many towns sank down\r\n      engulfed in the sea together with their burghers. And if\r\n      they do not break out, still the impetuous fury of the\r\n      air and the fierce violence of the wind spread over the\r\n      numerous passages of the earth like a shivering-fit and\r\n      thereby cause a trembling.\"\r\n\r\nOf course, no one at the present time believes this ridiculous\r\nexplanation as to the cause of earthquakes.\r\n\r\nAristotle, a Greek philosopher, speaks thus concerning earthquakes. We\r\nquote the translation employed by Mallet:\r\n\r\n      \"Three theories on the subject have been handed down to\r\n      us by three different persons; namely, Anaxagoras of\r\n      Klazomene, before him Anaximenes the Milesian, and later\r\n      than these Democritus of Abdera.\r\n\r\n      \"Anaxagoras says that the ether of nature rises upward, but\r\n      that when it falls into hollow places in the lower parts\r\n      of the earth it moves it (the earth); because the parts\r\n      above are cemented or closed up by rain, all parts being by\r\n      nature equally spongy or full of cavities, both those which\r\n      are above (where we live) and those which are below. Of\r\n      this opinion it may perhaps be unnecessary to say anything,\r\n      as being foolish, for it is absurd to suppose that things\r\n      would thus exist above and beneath, and that the parts of\r\n      bodies which have weight would not on every side be borne\r\n      to the earth, and those which are light, and fiery, rise;\r\n      especially since we see the surface of the earth to be\r\n      convex and spherical, the horizon constantly changing as\r\n      we change our place, at least as far as we know. And it is\r\n      also foolish to assert on the one hand that it remains in\r\n      the air on account of its great size, and on the other to\r\n      say that it is shaken, when struck from beneath upwards.\r\n      And besides these objections, it is to be remarked that\r\n      he has not treated of the attendant circumstances of\r\n      earthquakes, for neither every time nor place is subject to\r\n      these convulsions.\r\n\r\n      \"But Democritus says, that the earth being full of water,\r\n      and receiving much also by means of rain, is moved by\r\n      this. For when the water increases in bulk, because the\r\n      cavities cannot contain it, in its struggles it causes an\r\n      earthquake. And when the earth becomes partially dried up,\r\n      the water being drawn from the full reservoirs into those\r\n      which are empty, in passing from one to the other, by its\r\n      movements it causes an earthquake also.\r\n\r\n      \"Anaximenes, however, says that the earth, when parched up\r\n      and again moistened, cracks, and by the masses thus broken\r\n      off falling on it, is shaken; wherefore earthquakes occur\r\n      in drouths and again in times of rain; in drouths, because,\r\n      as we have said, it cracks, when highly dried, and then,\r\n      when moistened over again, it cracks and falls to pieces.\r\n      Were this the case, however, the earth ought to appear\r\n      in many places subsiding. Why then is it that hitherto\r\n      many places have been very subject to these convulsions\r\n      which do not present any such remarkable differences from\r\n      others? Yet such ought to be the case. And, moreover, those\r\n      who think thus must assert that earthquakes constantly\r\n      become less and less, and at last cease altogether. For\r\n      the continual condensation of the earth would cause this.\r\n      Wherefore, if this be not the fact, it is plain that this\r\n      is not the correct explanation.\"\r\n\r\nBesides the above, there are numerous references to earthquakes in the\r\nworks of other writers. Thales, Seneca, and Pliny all speak of these\r\nphenomena and appear to describe correctly the movement of the earth\r\nin waves both in the solid land, as well as on the sea.\r\n\r\nComing down to less ancient writers, Mallet refers to a book by\r\nFromondi, published in Antwerp, in 1527, that contains much valuable\r\nand interesting information. Among other things Fromondi declares\r\nthat in the year 369, in the reign of Valentinian, there was a great\r\nearthquake that shook nearly the entire world and that another\r\nearthquake of almost equal severity occurred in 1116. He also states\r\nthat in 1601 an earthquake continued for nearly forty days; that a\r\ngreat earthquake in Italy, in 1538, lasted fifteen days, and that\r\nanother, in Spain, lasted for nearly three years.\r\n\r\nThis does not mean that these earthquakes actually continued to shake\r\nthe earth violently for the times mentioned. These are only the times\r\nduring which, at intervals of greater or less length, successive\r\nshocks were felt in these localities.\r\n\r\nAnother of the less ancient writers referred to by Mallet is\r\nTravagini, who published a book in Venice in 1683. This book contains\r\na description of a terrible earthquake occurring in Italy on the 6th\r\nof April, 1667, which affected large portions of the country adjacent\r\nto Ragusa.\r\n\r\nWithout attempting at present to discuss the various theories of\r\nearthquakes, it will suffice to say that earthquakes can be divided,\r\naccording to their origin, into two classes: _volcanic earthquakes_,\r\nor earthquakes that are caused by practically the same forces that\r\ncause volcanoes, and _tectonic[3] earthquakes_, or those produced by\r\nthe slipping of a large mass of rock lying along the lines of old or\r\nnew fractures.\r\n\r\nEarthquakes of the first class are found especially in volcanic\r\ndistricts, while those of the second class are found in all parts\r\nof the world, whether in volcanic districts or elsewhere. According\r\nto Dana, earthquakes of the second class generally start in the\r\nneighborhood of mountains, where old lines of fractures are especially\r\nabundant.\r\n\r\nAs regards the direction of the shaking movements of the earth,\r\nearthquakes can be divided into three different classes: _explosive\r\nearthquakes_, or those in which the force acts vertically upwards;\r\n_horizontal earthquakes_, or those in which the force moves in a more\r\nor less horizontal direction, or parallel to the general surface\r\nof the earth, and _rotary earthquakes_, or those in which the earth\r\nrotates or moves in great eddies or whirls.\r\n\r\nWhen the earthquake wave is started below the earth's surface, it\r\nspreads through the crust in all directions. The direction these waves\r\nwill have on emerging, or coming out of the surface, will depend on\r\nthe distance of this point from the place the waves started. When a\r\nplace is situated directly over where the wave started, the waves will\r\nemerge so as to move vertically upwards, so that the earth at this\r\npoint will be shaken by an explosive earthquake. As the point where\r\nthe waves pass out is situated further and further from the place\r\nwhere the waves start, the waves will emerge more nearly horizontally,\r\nthe greater the distance from the source.\r\n\r\nIn explosive earthquakes, which, as just explained, occur at areas\r\nalmost immediately above the point where the disturbance starts,\r\nthe force is, generally speaking, the greatest. In earthquakes of\r\nthis character the force is sometimes sufficiently great to throw\r\nlarge bodies high up into the air. In the case of the great Riobamba\r\nearthquake of 1797, the force was not only sufficiently great to\r\nfracture the earth in various places, but also to throw bodies lying\r\non the surface great distances into the air. Bodies of men were thrown\r\nseveral hundred feet into the air and were afterwards found on the\r\nother side of a broad river or high up on the side of a hill.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that Humboldt did not inquire with as much care as\r\nhe should have done into these reports. They were probably greatly\r\nexaggerated, since it is difficult to understand how a force great as\r\nthis would have failed to detach the soil at these places, and hurl it\r\nafter the people. This much, however, can be accepted, that the upward\r\nforce was very great.\r\n\r\nIn the great Calabria earthquake of March, 1783, Dolomieu states that\r\nthe tops of the granite hills of Calabria were distinctly seen to rise\r\nand fall. In some cases houses were suddenly raised a great distance\r\nin the air, and were afterwards brought down again to a position of\r\nrest, at a higher level without any damage occurring to them. In a\r\nsimilar manner during the Caracas earthquake of March, 1812, the\r\nground was seen to rise and fall in a nearly vertical direction. But,\r\nperhaps, one of the most terrible earthquakes of this character was\r\nthe earthquake that destroyed the greater part of Jamaica in June,\r\n1793. During this earthquake the entire surface of the ground at Port\r\nRoyal assumed the appearance of a rolling sea. Houses were shifted\r\nfrom their old sites. Many of the inhabitants who had succeeded in\r\nescaping from the city to the neighboring country were thrown great\r\ndistances into the air. Some of these, by good fortune, fell into the\r\nharbor, from which, in some cases, they escaped with their lives. Here\r\nagain the projectile force was probably greatly exaggerated.\r\n\r\nVertical movements characterized the great earthquake of Lisbon, on\r\nNovember 1st, 1755, the city appearing to have been not far from the\r\npoint of origin.\r\n\r\nThe commonest type of earthquakes is the horizontal, where the waves\r\nemerge at the surface in a direction either horizontal or parallel\r\nto the general surface, or at least inclined to it at a very small\r\nangle. Where the materials of the earth's crust, through which the\r\nwaves spread, are of the same kind and of the same density in all\r\ndirections, the area shaken is approximately circular, but where the\r\nmaterials of the crust are more or less dense in some directions than\r\nin others, the area of disturbance is of course oblong or elliptical.\r\n\r\nIn some cases earthquakes of the horizontal type are limited almost\r\nentirely to a single direction. This is especially the case with\r\nearthquakes that occur in mountainous districts. These earthquakes are\r\nknown as _linear earthquakes_, since they spread almost in a single\r\nline.\r\n\r\nWhen earthquake waves pass from one medium to another, that is, from\r\none kind of rock to another, the greater portion of the waves is\r\nrefracted or bent out of their straight direction as they pass into\r\nthe new medium; a part of the waves, however, are reflected. It is\r\nthese reflected waves that probably cause rotary earthquakes.\r\n\r\nThe speed with which the surface waves move outwards in all\r\ndirections, varies not only with the force of the wave, but also with\r\nthe kind of material through which they pass. This velocity may be\r\nin the neighborhood of twenty miles per second, while in others the\r\nvelocity is as great as 140 miles per second.\r\n\r\nNaturally, one would suppose that the most severe earthquakes are\r\nthose in which the waves move the most rapidly. On the contrary,\r\nhowever, the comparatively feeble shocks are sent through the earth\r\nwith greater velocity.\r\n\r\nIn rotary earthquakes, as the name indicates, the ground is whirled\r\nor twisted in the manner of a violent eddy, and is often left in\r\nthis twisted condition. In the great Calabria earthquake, huge\r\nblocks of stone forming obelisks were twisted on one another in a\r\nmanner represented in Fig. 39. In this case the pedestals remained\r\nunaffected, but the separate blocks of stone were partially turned\r\naround, as shown. During this earthquake the earth was so twisted that\r\ntrees, which had been planted in straight lines before the earthquake,\r\nwere left standing in zigzags. During the great Charleston earthquake,\r\nSouth Carolina, the chimney-tops of the houses were separated at\r\nplaces where they joined the roof and were twisted around these places\r\nwithout being overthrown. In some of the houses wardrobes or bureaus\r\nwere turned at right angles to their former positions, and in some\r\ncases were even found with their faces turned towards the wall.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 39. HEAVY STONE OBELISKS TWISTED BY CALABRIAN\r\nEARTHQUAKE OF 1783]\r\n\r\nMallet suggests that in some cases the rotary motion is more apparent\r\nthan real, being due only to a to-and-fro motion without any twisting,\r\nthe apparent turning being due to the greater freedom of motion of the\r\nobject in one direction than in another. A twisting motion, however,\r\nhas actually taken place in some earthquakes.\r\n\r\nWhile separate shocks, in a given locality, may follow one another\r\nat intervals for fairly long times, yet the principal shock or shake\r\nthat produces the greatest damage is generally of exceedingly short\r\nduration. In the Caracas earthquake the greatest destruction was\r\naccomplished in about one minute. There were three distinct shocks,\r\neach of which lasted but three or four seconds. The great Calabria\r\nearthquake, of 1783, lasted but two minutes. The earthquake of Lisbon,\r\nin 1755, lasted five minutes, but the first, and worst, shock, was\r\nonly from five to six seconds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nSOME OF THE PHENOMENA OF EARTHQUAKES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe nature of an earthquake and the movements of its waves from\r\ntheir starting place having now been briefly described, it remains\r\nto explain some of the strange phenomena that precede, accompany, or\r\nfollow one.\r\n\r\nNext to the violent shaking of the earth's crust, perhaps the most\r\nwonderful and impressive thing is the great variety of sounds and\r\nnoises. These occur not only while the earth-waves are passing through\r\nthe crust at any place, but also long before the principal shocks\r\nreach the place, as well as long after they have passed.\r\n\r\nEarthquake sounds vary almost infinitely, both in intensity and\r\ncharacter. Some are like the gentle sighings of the wind, or resemble\r\nfaint mysterious whisperings; some are not unlike the confused\r\nmurmurings of a crowded room; some resemble the sounds of a busy\r\nstreet. Some sounds are full and strong, like the deep bass notes\r\nof a large organ. Others resemble the din of a great battle with\r\nthe reports of the large guns. Still others reach the intensity of\r\ncontinuous peals of thunder. But we can better understand the nature\r\nof earthquake sounds from an actual description of them in a number of\r\ngreat earthquakes, and by inquiring at the same time into any of the\r\npeculiar facts connected.\r\n\r\nHumboldt in his great work, \"Cosmos,\" thus describes the varied voice\r\nof the earthquake:\r\n\r\n      \"It is either rolling or rustling, or clanking, like\r\n      chains being moved, or like near thunder, or clear and\r\n      ringing, as if obsidian or some other vitrified masses were\r\n      struck in subterranean cavities.\"\r\n\r\nThat the sounds produced during earthquakes are carried through the\r\nground faster than through the air appears clear from the fact that\r\nsuch sounds are sometimes heard in deep mines when they are not at all\r\nheard on the earth's surface.\r\n\r\nIn describing the earthquake that occurred in Kamtschatka, in 1759,\r\nKrashenikoff of St. Petersburg states that noises were heard like the\r\nrushing of a strong underground wind, accompanied by a hissing sound,\r\nwhich resembled the sizzlings heard when red hot coals are thrown in\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nIn an earthquake that occurred in Lincolnshire, England, February\r\n6th, 1817, a noise was heard closely resembling the sounds of wagons\r\nrunning away on a road. So complete and convincing was the resemblance\r\nthat several wagoners on one of the roads drew their teams to one side\r\nso as to permit the runaway to pass safely.\r\n\r\nAnother kind of noise heard during earthquakes is a loud hollow\r\nbellowing. Sometimes, however, the sounds are more musical in their\r\nnature, being not unlike those produced by a very large organ pipe. At\r\nother times they resemble the noises produced when steam is blown into\r\ncold water.\r\n\r\nThe following account of earthquake sounds is given by Daubeny,\r\nin his book on volcanoes. It appears that during March, 1822, the\r\npeople living on the island of Melida, opposite Ragusa, in Dalmatia,\r\nwere greatly alarmed by sounds that at first they believed due to\r\ncannonading either at sea or on the neighboring coast. They afterwards\r\nfound that these sounds were due to something that was taking place\r\nunder the ground. The noises continued at intervals until August\r\n23d, 1823, when a great earthquake occurred, during which one of the\r\nhighest mountains on the island was cleft or split in one place. The\r\nunderground noises continued from time to time and so frightened\r\nthe people that they were about to leave the island permanently and\r\nemigrate to the mainland of Dalmatia. They were dissuaded from doing\r\nso by the government, and while the noises continued at intervals it\r\nso happened that no damage came to them. It is said, however, that\r\ntwenty years after an active volcano broke out on the island.\r\n\r\nThere are various causes that produce earthquake sounds. A very slight\r\nrubbing or grinding together of rock surfaces may produce fairly\r\nloud noises, the volume of the sound being increased by transmission\r\nthrough the rock masses that lie in the path of the waves. An example\r\nof such an increase in the loudness of sounds is seen in the case of\r\nseveral of the large blocks of stone used for some of the piers of\r\nKingston Harbor, in Ireland. When these rocks are moved together by\r\nblows of the waves they produce loud and appalling sounds, as if the\r\nwhole island were being washed away. The same rocks, however, when\r\nleft high and dry on the falling of the tide, can be caused to rub\r\ntogether, when moved by the hand. Under these circumstances, they\r\nproduce but feeble sounds that can only be heard in their immediate\r\nneighborhood.\r\n\r\nNo doubt, some find it difficult to understand how it is possible for\r\ncomparatively feeble sound-waves to be strengthened by their passage\r\nthrough large masses of solids. This is important and should be made\r\nclear. As everyone well knows, the ticking of a watch can only be\r\nheard at a short distance when the watch is held in the hand, because\r\nthe sound-waves cannot readily pass through the body of the person\r\nholding the watch to the earth, the materials of the body not being\r\nsufficiently elastic. If, however, the watch be placed on the bare\r\nsurface of a large wooden table from which the tablecloth has been\r\nremoved, so that the watch can come directly in contact with the wood,\r\nand nothing else is placed on the table but the watch, the sound-waves\r\nare transmitted to the mass of the table and its entire surface sends\r\nthem out into the air. The ticking of the watch can then be heard\r\ndistinctly in almost any part of a large room.\r\n\r\nMallet states that in nearly all great earthquakes sounds are heard\r\nbefore the principal shock, and in his description of the Calabrian\r\nearthquake Hamilton says:\r\n\r\n      \"All agreed that every shock seemed to come with a rumbling\r\n      noise from the westward, beginning with the horizontal and\r\n      ending with the vorticose (rotary) motion.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to Dolomieu, during the Lisbon earthquake, the shocks were\r\npreceded \"by a loud subterranean noise like thunder, which was renewed\r\nfor every shock.... This great shock,\" he says, referring to one of\r\nthe great upward shocks, \"occurred without the prelude of any slight\r\nshocks, without any notice whatever as suddenly as the blowing up of\r\na mine.... Some, however, pretend that a muffled interior noise was\r\nheard almost at the same moment.\"\r\n\r\nThe noises do not generally continue long after the earthquake shocks.\r\nIn some cases, however, a very loud noise is heard at intervals for a\r\nconsiderable length of time after the principal shock. This was the\r\ncase at Quito and Ibarra, in which a great noise was heard for from\r\neighteen to twenty minutes after the principal shock. In a similar\r\nmanner during the earthquake of October, 1746, at Lima, and Callao,\r\nSouth America, peals of underground thunder were heard at Truxillo\r\nfor fifteen minutes after the principal shock. In such cases it\r\nseems probable that the noises were not caused by the same impulses\r\nthat caused the original shock, but by the forces that caused the\r\nsubsequent shock.\r\n\r\nHumboldt relates that in 1784 there were noises heard at Guanajuato,\r\nfrom the 9th to the 12th of February. They were not, however, followed\r\nby an earthquake.\r\n\r\nHumboldt also states that in an earthquake which occurred on the 30th\r\nof April, 1812, on the banks of the Orinoco River, in South America,\r\na loud thundering noise was heard, without, however, any shock, but\r\nat this time a volcano on the island of St. Vincent, in the Lesser\r\nAntilles, although some 632 miles to the northeast, was pouring out\r\nstreams of lava. Again in the great eruption of Cotopaxi, in 1734,\r\nunderground noises were heard as if cannon were being fired. These\r\nsounds were distinctly heard at as great a distance as Honda on the\r\nbanks of the Magdalena River. Now, bearing in mind that the crater of\r\nCotopaxi is situated on the high plateau of Quito, in a region full\r\nof valleys and fissures, it would seem that for the sounds to have\r\nbeen sent through the 436 miles between the mountains and the valley\r\nof the Magdalena River, the waves must, for the greater part, have\r\nbeen transmitted through the solid earth at some considerable distance\r\nbelow the surface.\r\n\r\nMallet states that the underground noises which continued for more\r\nthan a month from the midnight of January 9th, 1784, at Guanajuato,\r\nwere not followed by any earthquake shocks, that it was if as thunder\r\nclouds occupied the space below the surface at that part of the earth\r\nand from these clouds there came the slow rolling sounds like short,\r\nquick, snaps of thunder.\r\n\r\nMajor Dutton in his book entitled \"Earthquakes in the Light of the\r\nNew Seismology\" gives the following as the principal signs that herald\r\nthe coming earthquake in the open country.\r\n\r\n      \"The first sensation is the sound. It is wholly unlike\r\n      anything we have ever heard before, unless we have already\r\n      had a similar experience. It is a strange murmur. Some\r\n      liken it to the sighing of pine-trees in the wind, or to\r\n      falling rain; others to the distant roar of the surf;\r\n      others to the far-off rumble of the railway train; others\r\n      to distant thunder. It grows louder. The earth begins to\r\n      quiver, then to shake rudely. Soon the ground begins to\r\n      heave. Then it is actually seen to be traversed by visible\r\n      waves somewhat likes waves at sea, but of less height and\r\n      moving much more swiftly. The sound becomes a roar. It is\r\n      difficult to stand, and at length it becomes impossible to\r\n      do so. The victim flings himself to the ground to avoid\r\n      being dashed to it, or he clings to a convenient sapling,\r\n      or fence-post, to avoid being overthrown. The trees are\r\n      seen to sway sometimes through large arcs, and are said,\r\n      doubtless with exaggeration, to touch the ground with\r\n      their branches, first on one side, then on the other. As\r\n      the waves rush past, the ground on the crests opens in\r\n      cracks which close again in the troughs. As they close, the\r\n      squeezed-out air blows forth sand and gravel, and sometimes\r\n      sand and water are spurted high in air. The roar becomes\r\n      appalling. Through its din are heard loud, deep, solemn\r\n      booms that seem like the voice of the Eternal One, speaking\r\n      out of the depths of the universe. Suddenly this storm\r\n      subsides, the earth comes speedily to rest and all is over.\"\r\n\r\nThere are many other curious phenomena besides earthquake sounds or\r\nnoises. Among some of the more interesting are the fire and smoke that\r\nare seen to come out of fissures that have been rent in the ground.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that in many cases these flashes of fire are in reality\r\nproduced by electric discharges that momentarily light the clouds of\r\ndust thrown up out of the fissure. But sometimes true flames are seen\r\nescaping from the fissures. This was the case during the earthquake of\r\nLisbon, in 1755, when fire burst through fissures at several places,\r\nburning with a lambent flame for some hours.\r\n\r\nThe clouds of dust that follow the rending of mountain masses by\r\nearthquakes are probably to be traced to the fracture of the rock\r\nmasses, the dust so formed being violently thrown forth by the air\r\nsqueezed out of the fissures, when they are suddenly closed. The\r\nviolent compression of this air may raise this dust to incandescence.\r\n\r\nMallet asserts that in many cases the clouds of smoke observed do\r\nnot consist of true smoke like that produced when wood or vegetable\r\nmatters are incompletely burned, but is only ordinary air mixed with\r\nsulphurous acid gas, and various other gases.\r\n\r\nBut not only fire and smoke are seen at times coming out of fissures\r\nin the earth. A thing still more frequently thrown out is water, which\r\noften spouts forth along with great quantities of mud, sand, and the\r\nfinely ground fragments of earthy materials generally. Among many\r\nother instances where the emission of water from the crevices was\r\nparticularly noticeable, may be mentioned the earthquakes at Jamaica\r\nin 1687 and 1692. Here the water, in some places, was thrown out of\r\nthe ground to considerable heights in the air.\r\n\r\nMallet calls attention to the fact that the waters of springs collect\r\nin reservoirs consisting either of fissures or crevices of the rocks,\r\nof small width but great depth, which are vertical or inclined to the\r\nhorizon, or in reservoirs that are formed of extended beds of sand or\r\ngravel.\r\n\r\nNow, when the earthquake waves moving horizontally over the surface\r\nproduce movements that squeeze these fissures together, the water in\r\nthe fissures is spurted out in high jets, and carries with it the\r\nfinely divided rock or sand formed by the rubbing together of the rock\r\nsurfaces. In the case of the reservoirs consisting of beds of sand\r\nor gravel, lying between impervious layers, if, during an earthquake\r\nmotion, the land areas are suddenly lowered, the water rushing into\r\nthe cavity thus left will afterwards be shot out with considerable\r\nforce, when the land is suddenly raised again.\r\n\r\nWhere there are no direct openings in the ground the water will burst\r\nthrough the crust in the shape of great vertical jets, thus forming a\r\ncircular hole, broken or fractured at its edges. Water jets of this\r\ncharacter were especially numerous during the earthquake of Calabria\r\nin 1783. In a swampy plain, known as Rosarno, many of these circular\r\nwells or openings about the size of an ordinary carriage wheel, though\r\nin some cases much larger, were to be seen crowded together. The\r\nappearance of the openings are represented in Fig. 40.\r\n\r\nSome of these were filled with water, but the greater number were dry\r\nand filled with loose sand. These latter, when examined by digging,\r\nwere shown to be funnel-shaped, as seen in Fig. 41. As seen, the\r\nmargins of the wells exhibit a series of cracks or crevices extending\r\nradially outward from the centre. Their origin is evident. As the\r\nwater was violently expelled by the squeezing motion of the upper\r\nand lower impervious strata, it shot upwards, thus producing the\r\nfunnel-shaped tube. At the same time the force of the eruption was\r\nsufficiently great to produce the radial fissures or fractures at the\r\nsides.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 40. CIRCULAR HOLLOW FORMED BY CALABRIAN\r\nEARTHQUAKE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 41. SECTION OF CIRCULAR HOLLOW FORMED BY\r\nCALABRIAN EARTHQUAKE]\r\n\r\nBut greater fissures than these have been formed by earthquakes,\r\nespecially those of the class created by a slipping of the earth's\r\nstrata. In the case of an earthquake on the South Island of New\r\nZealand, in 1848, a fissure having an average width of eighteen\r\ninches could be clearly seen extending in a direction parallel to\r\nthe mountain chain for a distance of sixty miles, and during a later\r\nearthquake in the same region, in 1855, a fracture was formed that\r\ncould be clearly traced for a distance of nearly ninety miles.\r\n\r\nIn some cases these fissures or fractured parts of the crust are left\r\nwith one of their sides at a higher level than the opposite side. This\r\nwas the case of the great Japanese earthquake of October 28th, 1891.\r\n\r\nThere are three kinds of waves produced by earthquakes; namely, the\r\nearthquake waves proper through the earth; the sound waves in the air,\r\nand great forced waves in the sea.\r\n\r\nThe sound waves of course reach the air from the point of origin below\r\nthe earth's surface through the solid materials of the crust, and take\r\non the curious varieties already described in connection with the\r\nsounds accompanying earthquakes.\r\n\r\nWe have already briefly described the manner in which the earthquake\r\nwaves travel through the materials of the earth's crust. There remain\r\nto be discussed the great waves that are rolled up in the ocean\r\nduring an earthquake shock. These waves are, perhaps, among the most\r\ndestructive phenomena of great earthquakes. The following are only\r\nsome of the more remarkable of such waves, and have been taken from\r\nMallet's collection of earthquake data.\r\n\r\nDuring some of the great earthquakes on the coasts of Chile and Peru,\r\nhuge waves from the ocean did great damage when they reached the land.\r\nIn the earthquake of 1590, ocean waves rushed for several leagues\r\ninland over the coast of Chile, carrying with them ships that were\r\nleft high and dry as the wave receded. In the earthquake of 1687,\r\nCallao was inundated by a great wave from the Pacific Ocean, and ships\r\nwere carried a full league into the country. During the earthquake of\r\n1746, Callao was again swept away by a huge ocean wave. At later times\r\nearthquake waves have caused great damage to several other parts of\r\nthe coast of South America.\r\n\r\nOcean waves of this character are formed by successive upward and\r\ndownward movements at the bottom of the ocean, following each other at\r\nvery brief intervals. Le Conte points out that the sudden upheaval of\r\nthe bed of the ocean forms a huge mound in the surface of the water\r\nwhich results in a large wave that spreads rapidly in all directions.\r\nWaves produced in this manner sometimes reach a height of fifty to\r\nsixty feet. They are not readily observed in the deep ocean, but\r\nas soon as they reach the shallow waters near the shore they rush\r\nforward, forming waves from fifty to sixty feet in height and, rushing\r\nover the land, sweep everything before them.\r\n\r\nDuring the great Lisbon earthquake of 1755 a huge wave started at a\r\npoint fifty miles off the coast of Portugal. Half an hour after the\r\nearthquake was over several waves, the largest of which was sixty\r\nfeet in height, rushed over a part of the city and greatly increased\r\nthe ruin already wrought by the earthquake. According to Le Conte the\r\ngreat waves so formed moved in all directions across the Atlantic\r\nOcean. They were thirty feet high when they reached Cadiz, eighteen\r\nfeet in height at Madeira, and five feet on the coast of Ireland. They\r\neven crossed the Atlantic, being observed on the coasts of the West\r\nIndies.\r\n\r\nA great ocean wave accompanied the Japanese earthquake in 1854. As in\r\nthe case of the Lisbon earthquake this wave started in the bed of the\r\nocean off the coast of Japan and only reached the island half an hour\r\nafterwards. It was thirty feet in height, and completely swept away\r\nthe town of Simoda.\r\n\r\nOwing to water's greater freedom of motion earthquake waves travel\r\ngreater distances through the water than they do on land.\r\n\r\nOf course, great earthquake shocks as a rule cause a very large loss\r\nof life. The following figures from Mallet give some idea of the\r\nextent of this loss, which is generally a matter of a few moments.\r\n\r\nIn the Lisbon earthquake, where the worst shock lasted a few seconds,\r\n60,000 people were killed. During other earthquakes the losses have\r\nbeen as follows: 10,000 at Morocco; 40,000 in Calabria; 50,000 in\r\nSyria, and probably 120,000 in earthquakes that occurred in Syria in\r\nA. D. 19 and in A. D. 526.\r\n\r\nBut even these figures give only a meagre idea of the vast loss of\r\nlife that has occurred during the past. It is said that during the\r\nreign of Justinian, earthquakes repeatedly shook the whole Roman\r\nworld. The city of Constantinople was visited by earthquake shocks\r\nthat continued at intervals for forty days. Deep chasms were opened in\r\nthe earth and huge masses were thrown into the air. Enormous sea-waves\r\nwere formed. At Antioch, during the earthquake of May 20th, A.\r\nD. 526, 250,000 people are believed to have been killed.\r\n\r\nOn the 31st of July, A. D. 365, in the second year of\r\nValentinian, a dreadful earthquake shook the Roman world, and a great\r\nwave rolled in from the Mediterranean and swept two miles inland,\r\ncarrying ships over the tops of houses. During this earthquake 50,000\r\npeople lost their lives at Alexandria.\r\n\r\nIn the earthquake of Messina in 1692, 74,000 people are said to have\r\nbeen killed; and, according to other accounts, 100,000. In the year\r\nA. D. 602, another earthquake at Antioch killed 60,000 people.\r\n\r\nDuring the earthquake of Quito, in 1797, Humboldt estimates that\r\n40,000 natives were either buried in crevices in the earth, under\r\nthe ruins of buildings, or were drowned in lakes and ponds that were\r\ntemporarily formed.\r\n\r\nIn this connection Mallet writes as follows:\r\n\r\n      \"Such are the numbers to be met with in narratives, and\r\n      if we suppose that there occurs one great earthquake in\r\n      three years over the whole earth and that this involves the\r\n      entombment of only 10,000 human beings, and that such has\r\n      been the economy of our system for the last 4,000 years, we\r\n      shall have a number representing above 13,000,000 men thus\r\n      suddenly swallowed up, with countless bodies of animals of\r\n      every lower class. Sir Charles Lyell then with good reason\r\n      suggests that even in our own time we may yet find the\r\n      remains of men and of their habitations and implements thus\r\n      buried deep and embalmed, as it were, by earthquakes that\r\n      occurred in the days of Moses and the Ptolemies.\"\r\n\r\nNecessarily the progress of a great earthquake wave will produce great\r\nchanges in the earth's surface features; for example, landslides,\r\nwhere immense layers of clay or other material slip or slide to a\r\nlower level and are thrown across the course of a river, causing its\r\nwaters to be dammed up and then by spreading to form great lakes.\r\n\r\nSometimes, after vast bodies of water have been collected in this\r\nmanner, disastrous floods result later from a sudden giving way of the\r\nbarrier, and the loss thus caused is occasionally far greater than\r\nthat directly due to the earthquake.\r\n\r\nPermanent changes of level are frequently caused by earthquakes, as,\r\nfor example, the coast of Chile during the earthquake of November\r\n19th, 1822, where the coast for many miles was raised from three to\r\nfour feet above its former plane.\r\n\r\nIn other cases the level of the ground is permanently lowered. This\r\noccurred in the Bengal earthquake in 1762, when an area of some sixty\r\nsquare miles suddenly sank, leaving only the tops of the higher points\r\nabove water.\r\n\r\nIn some cases of changes in the level of the ground, large areas being\r\nraised in one place and lowered in another, rivers take new courses,\r\nand their old courses are completely obliterated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nTHE EARTHQUAKE OF CALABRIA IN 1783\r\n\r\n\r\nAll students of elementary geography are quick to notice that the\r\nextreme southeastern part of Italy is shaped something like a boot,\r\nwhich appears to be kicking at the island of Sicily. This part of the\r\nMediterranean Sea has for very many years been the arena or storm\r\ncentre of more or less intense volcanic activity. To the northwest is\r\nthe active volcano of Vesuvius, as well as the volcanic regions of the\r\nPhlegræan Fields. Immediately opposite the point of Italy, near the\r\ntoe of the foot, is the active volcanic mountain, Etna, while not far\r\nfrom this point is the volcano of Stromboli.\r\n\r\nIn 1783 this part of the world was visited by a very severe\r\nearthquake. Since at that time the country was divided into two\r\nparts, known as Upper Calabria and Lower Calabria, this earthquake is\r\nsometimes spoken of as the earthquake of the Calabrias, or more simply\r\nas the Calabrian earthquake.\r\n\r\nThe great mountain range of the Apennines, mainly of granite\r\nformation, extends through the central part of Italy. The lands\r\nadjoining the mountains on each side are flat and marshy, and\r\nconsequently unhealthy.\r\n\r\nNumerous observers have compiled excellent accounts of the Calabrian\r\nearthquake. These, having been made by educated persons, are, to a\r\nlarge extent free from the inconsistencies and exaggerations apt to\r\ncharacterize descriptions by ignorant persons, especially when in\r\na condition of excitement or alarm. Among reliable writers was Sir\r\nWilliam Hamilton, who made a personal examination of the region, soon\r\nafter the first severe shock, and collected much valuable information\r\nfor a paper which was afterwards published in the Philosophical\r\nTransactions of the Royal Society. Then, too, Dolomieu, another\r\nscientific man of high ability, made a careful study of the effects\r\nproduced by the earthquake.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 42. MAP OF THE CALABRIAN EARTHQUAKE OF\r\n1783]\r\n\r\nAs can be seen by an examination of the map presented in Fig. 42, the\r\npart of Italy included in the Calabrias covers an area from north to\r\nsouth almost equal to two degrees of latitude. Although the shock\r\nextended beyond the limits of Calabria, since it reached as far north\r\nas Naples, as well as over a great part of the Island of Sicily, the\r\nterritory in which the greatest damage was done did not exceed in area\r\nabout 500 square miles.\r\n\r\nThe southern part of Italy is subject to frequent earthquake shocks.\r\nPignatari, an Italian physician, asserts that this region was visited\r\nduring 1783 by no less than 949 earthquakes, of which 501 were of the\r\nfirst class, or degree of intensity, while in 1784, there were 151\r\nearthquakes, of which ninety-eight were of the first class.\r\n\r\nIt seems that the city of Oppido, marked on the above map as midway\r\nbetween the two coasts, was the point from which the severe earthquake\r\nof 1783 started. If one draws a circle, with a radius of twenty-two\r\nmiles, around Oppido as a centre, the portions of the Calabrias that\r\nwere the most affected will all lie within this circle.\r\n\r\nThe great Calabrian earthquake was attended by numerous shocks. The\r\nfirst and the most severe shock, that of February 5th, 1783, was only\r\ntwo minutes in destroying most of the houses in all cities, towns, and\r\nvillages on the western side of the Apennines in this part of Italy.\r\n\r\nAnother severe shock occurred on the 28th of March. This shock was\r\nalmost as severe as that of February 5th.\r\n\r\nIn order to understand many of the effects produced by this\r\nearthquake, inquiry must be made into the geological character of the\r\nregion. According to Dolomieu, the flat country at the slopes of the\r\nApennines, known as the Plain of Calabria, is covered with sand and\r\nclay mixed with sea shells. These strata have been deposited by the\r\nsea from materials that have been obtained by the decomposition of the\r\ngranite mountain ranges in the Apennines. The plain is quite level\r\nexcept where it is crossed by deep valleys or ravines, which have\r\nbeen eroded or cut by the swift mountain torrents. In many cases,\r\nthese ravines or valleys have depths as great as 600 feet. Their sides\r\nare generally almost perpendicular. Consequently, as Lyell remarks,\r\nthroughout the length of the mountain chain, the soil, which adheres\r\nbut loosely to the granite base of the mountain chain, could therefore\r\nbe easily separated from the mountain, and sliding over the solid\r\nsteeps of the mountain could readily move, especially through the\r\nravines or gorges, to distances in some cases as great as from nine to\r\nten miles.\r\n\r\nThis peculiarity of the country must be thoroughly understood, since,\r\notherwise, it would seem impossible that lands could be carried\r\nseveral miles from their former position, and often bear along\r\nwith them almost undisturbed houses, olive groves, vineyards, and\r\ncultivated fields.\r\n\r\nThe heaving of the surface of the earth like the waters of the sea,\r\nso common in severe earthquakes, occurred during the Calabrian\r\nearthquake. In some places this heaving so shook the trees that they\r\nbent until their tops touched the ground near their base.\r\n\r\nParts of the ground were violently thrown upwards into the air as in\r\nthe explosive type of earthquakes. In many instances the large paving\r\nstones were thrown into the air and afterwards found with their lower\r\nportions upwards.\r\n\r\nDuring the earthquake deep fissures were made in the earth at various\r\nlocalities and there were, moreover, marked changes of level. At\r\nMessina in Sicily the shore was fissured and rent and while before the\r\nconvulsion the surface had been level, it was afterwards found to be\r\ninclined toward the sea.\r\n\r\nAccording to Dolomieu the following curious incident occurred during\r\nthe passage of the earthquake waves. A well in the ground of one of\r\nthe convents of the Augustines, lined on the inside with stones, was\r\nso affected by the upward thrust given to the land that its stone\r\nlining was left projecting above the level of the earth in the form of\r\na small tower some eight or nine feet in height.\r\n\r\nFrequent instances occurred of deep fissures in the surface of the\r\nearth. Many of these remained open after the earthquake, although in\r\nother cases they were firmly closed together before the earthquake\r\nshocks ceased.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 43. FISSURES CAUSED BY THE CALABRIAN\r\nEARTHQUAKE]\r\n\r\nFig. 43 represents the appearance of certain fissures in a part of\r\nCalabria during this earthquake. These cracks, it will be noticed,\r\nradiate or pass outward in all directions from a central point, just\r\nlike the cracks that are formed in a glass window pane when it is\r\nfractured by a stone thrown against it.\r\n\r\nOf course, the most violent effects were near the origin of the\r\nearthquake at Oppido. Here the formation of deep fissures was common.\r\nIn another part of the country a number of buildings were suddenly\r\nswallowed up in a central chasm, which almost immediately closed,\r\nthus permanently burying all these objects.\r\n\r\nSome idea of the force with which the fissures were afterwards closed\r\ncan be formed by reflecting on a case where, in order to recover some\r\nof the buried articles, the ground was dug up at these points, and it\r\nwas found that the materials, human bodies and other objects, were so\r\njammed together as to make one compact mass.\r\n\r\nTo Sir William Hamilton a place was shown where the fissures, though,\r\nwhen he saw them, they were not more than a foot in width, had opened\r\nsufficiently wide during the shock to swallow up a hundred goats as\r\nwell as an ox.\r\n\r\nAn earthquake that caused such marked changes in the appearance of the\r\nearth's surface, naturally made great changes in the direction of the\r\nrivers. In one case the end of a small valley was so completely filled\r\nwith stones and dirt that the water was dammed up, producing a lake\r\ntwo miles in length and one mile in breadth. In a similar manner no\r\nless than 215 lakes were formed in different portions of Calabria.\r\n\r\nOf course, in the flat country at the base of the Apennines,\r\nfrequent landslides occurred, the land sliding into great chasms and\r\ncontinuing to move down them for considerable distances, so that in\r\nmany places pieces of land containing olive trees, vineyards, and\r\ngreen fields, were bodily transported for distances of several miles.\r\nThis, moreover, was done so quietly as to leave the houses entirely\r\nuninjured, and the trees and other vegetation continuing to grow up\r\nwith apparently no marked decrease in vitality.\r\n\r\nAs is usual in such cases, the sudden and strong blows acting on the\r\nwaters of the sea, killed great numbers of fish just as does the\r\nexplosion of dynamite at a point below the surface of the water; and\r\nin a similar way the fish that usually live at the bottom of the sea\r\nin the soft mud, being disturbed by the earthquake shocks, came near\r\nthe surface where they were caught in vast numbers.\r\n\r\nIt is an interesting fact that during this earthquake the volcano of\r\nStromboli showed a marked decrease in the volume of smoke it gave out.\r\nEtna, however, was observed to emit large quantities of vapor during\r\nthe convulsion.\r\n\r\nLyell tells the following story of the Prince of Scilla, who with\r\nmany of his vassals sought safety in their fishing boats. Suddenly,\r\non the night of February 5th, while some of the people were sleeping\r\nin the boat, and others were resting on a low plain near the sea,\r\nin the neighborhood, another shock occurred, a great mass was torn\r\nfrom a neighboring mountain and hurled with a crash on the plain, and\r\nimmediately afterwards a wave, twenty feet or more in height, rolled\r\nover the level plain, sweeping away the people. It then retreated, but\r\nsoon rushed back again, bringing with it many of the bodies of the\r\npeople who had perished. At the same time all the boats were either\r\nsunk or dashed against the beach, and the Prince with 1,430 of his\r\npeople was destroyed.\r\n\r\nThe total number of deaths caused by this earthquake in the Calabrias\r\nand Sicily were estimated by Hamilton at 40,000. Besides these about\r\n20,000 more perished in epidemics that followed the earthquake, or\r\ndied for lack of proper food.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT LISBON EARTHQUAKE OF 1755\r\n\r\n\r\nLisbon, the capital of Portugal, on the Tagus River, is built along\r\nboth banks for five miles, and on several small neighboring hills. It\r\nis supplied with water by means of an aqueduct, called the Alcantara,\r\nwhich brings the water from springs about nine miles to the northwest.\r\nFor portions of its length the aqueduct is placed underground, but\r\nwhere it crosses the deep valley of the Alcantara it is supported,\r\nfor a distance of 2,400 feet, by a number of marble arches, which\r\nin one place are 260 feet in height. This fact is put forward not\r\nmerely for the sake of its artistic interest, but because, strange to\r\nrelate, this part of the aqueduct remained uninjured during that great\r\nearthquake, the greatest of modern times.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of November, 1755, this frightful catastrophe, according to\r\nLyell, from whose excellent account much of the information contained\r\nin this chapter has been obtained, struck the beautiful city almost\r\nwithout any warning. Terrible sounds came suddenly from underground;\r\nalmost instantly afterward a violent shock threw down the greater\r\nportion of the city; in less than six minutes 60,000 people were\r\nkilled.\r\n\r\nThe place from which this earthquake started must have been situated\r\non the bed of the ocean at some distance from the coast; for the great\r\nwave thus raised in the Atlantic Ocean did not reach the mouth of the\r\nTagus River until about half an hour after the most severe shocks\r\nwere over. The arrival of this wave at the mouth of the Tagus was\r\nannounced by the sea retiring to such an extent as to leave the bar\r\ndry. Then a huge wave, sixty feet in height, rolled in from the ocean\r\nand completed the work of destruction that had been commenced by the\r\nearthquake.\r\n\r\nSo great was the shock that the mountains in the neighborhood were\r\nviolently shaken and some of them split or fractured in a most\r\nwonderful manner.\r\n\r\nParticularly large was the loss of life in the churches whither\r\nhundreds hastened for refuge when the shakings of the earth began,\r\nfor most of these buildings fell and buried the worshippers. Another\r\nimmense loss of life was caused by the destruction of a large marble\r\nquay or wharf that was suddenly swallowed up by the sea. While the\r\nbuildings in the city were being overthrown by the violent shakings\r\nof the earth, a multitude sought the quay as a flat place where they\r\ncould not be injured by the falling buildings. Suddenly, however,\r\nthis structure sank into the water and not only were all the people\r\ndrowned, but none of the bodies was ever afterwards found.\r\n\r\nFailure to find any remnants of the pier or any of the people who\r\nperished on it has been attributed to the formation of eddies or\r\nwhirls that were sufficiently strong to carry down vessels by suction\r\nsimilar to that of the famous maelstrom off the coast of Norway. Of\r\ncourse, in a time of boundless excitement like that of the Lisbon\r\nearthquake, accounts are apt to be highly exaggerated. For example,\r\nassertions are made in many books that the water left in the harbor\r\nafter the sinking of the quay was unfathomable. Now, in point of fact,\r\nthe depth of this place has been measured and found to be less than\r\n100 fathoms.\r\n\r\nWhen it is remembered that not one of the bodies of the people on that\r\nquay was ever again seen, it is possible, as Lyell suggests, that a\r\ndeep fissure or chasm opened immediately on the ground on which the\r\nquay stood, so that it, together with all on it, were dropped into the\r\nchasm, which, closing, buried them deep in the earth.\r\n\r\nThe Lisbon earthquake was especially noted for the extent of country\r\naffected by it. Humboldt estimated this area as being more than four\r\ntimes the size of Europe. In parts of this area immense mountain\r\nranges, such as the Pyrenees, Alps, etc., were violently shaken. When\r\nthe size of these mountains is considered one realizes that it must\r\nhave required a mighty force to shake them. These shakings were so\r\nsevere that they produced a deep fissure in the ground in France.\r\nContinuing towards the north the solid earth was shaken as far as\r\nthe shores of the Baltic and Norway and Sweden, generally. This, of\r\ncourse, included the flat country of Northern Germany. The hot springs\r\nof Toplitz disappeared for a time, but, breaking out afterwards,\r\ndischarged such quantities of muddy water that the surrounding country\r\nwas inundated.\r\n\r\nThe waves crossed the Atlantic, causing high tides on the island of\r\nAntigua, Barbadoes, and Martinique, of the Lesser Antilles, where,\r\ninstead of the usual tides of two feet, tides of twenty feet high were\r\nobserved. Further to the north the waves reached the eastern shores of\r\nNorth America, and shook the continent as far west as the Great Lakes,\r\nand spread in the North Atlantic as far as Iceland.\r\n\r\nToward the south the waves affected parts of northwestern Africa,\r\nwhere much loss of life occurred in the villages some eight leagues\r\ndistant from the city of Morocco. Here from 8,000 to 10,000 people\r\nwere killed, being swallowed up by deep fissures in the earth, which\r\nafterwards closed on their bodies.\r\n\r\nSevere shocks were in many cases felt on vessels at sea. In one\r\ninstance, although the vessels were at considerable distances from\r\nwhere the waves started, the captains reported that the shocks were so\r\ngreat that on several occasions it was believed the vessel had struck\r\na rock, till, on heaving the lead, they found that they were in very\r\ndeep water. In another instance, such was the shock to the vessel that\r\nthe planks on the deck had their seams opened. In still another case\r\nseveral of the sailors were thrown into the air for a distance of\r\nabout one and a half feet.\r\n\r\nIt has been frequently observed that when great earthquakes happen,\r\ncurious changes take place in the level of the waters of lakes\r\nentirely disconnected with the ocean; for example, mountain lakes,\r\nfar above the level of the sea, the water suddenly rising and then\r\nresuming its original level. Sometimes the waters of such lakes have\r\nsuddenly disappeared, probably being drained off through a fissure\r\nformed in the bed of the lake. In such event the lake generally\r\nremains dry after the passage of the earthquake.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the Lisbon earthquake it was observed that the water of\r\nLoch Lomond in Scotland first rose above its ordinary, then sank again\r\nto its usual level. This difference of level is explained by Lyell as\r\nfollows: when the earthquake waves reached the lake, the water being\r\nunable to take the sudden shove given to it by the earthquake waves,\r\ndashed over that side of the basin which first received the shock.\r\nAssuming this to be the case, since the rise of the level in the water\r\nof Loch Lomond was two feet and four inches, it is comparatively easy\r\nto calculate the speed of movement that the earthquake waves had,\r\nwhen they reached this body of water. Calculated in this way it would\r\nseem that the waves had a speed of about twenty miles a minute.\r\n\r\nBut what especially characterized the Lisbon earthquake were the great\r\nwaves that were produced in the ocean. Besides the huge wave that\r\nentered the Tagus, a wave of the same height swept eastward along the\r\nsouthern coast of Spain, and the northwestern coast of Africa. At\r\nTangier in Africa it swept the coast as a very high wave no less than\r\neighteen times, or, in other words, eighteen huge waves rolled in from\r\nthe ocean. At Funchal, on the Madeira Islands, this wave rose fifteen\r\nfeet above the high water mark.\r\n\r\nMany attempts have been made to explain the manner in which the great\r\nsea waves are started in earthquake movements. Some believe that they\r\nare due to the sudden raising or heaving up of the water, far above\r\nordinary level. But, as Lyell points out, this explanation would not\r\nbe satisfactory for the waves produced in the case of the Lisbon\r\nearthquake, since it would fail to account for the fact that both on\r\nthe coasts of Portugal as well as on the island of Madeira the high\r\nwave was preceded by a movement of the water toward the point of\r\norigin; that is, the waters moved away from Lisbon and the Madeira\r\nIslands, so as to leave the water very low at those points, when\r\nshortly afterwards a huge wave rushed in from the sea and swept over\r\nthe land.\r\n\r\nEarthquake waves move much more rapidly through the solid rocks of\r\nthe earth's crust than through the waters of the ocean. The shock\r\ntransmitted through the solid earth from Lisbon to the Madeira Islands\r\ntook only twenty-five minutes to reach the islands, while the waves in\r\nthe ocean took about two and a half hours to cover the same distance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nTHE EARTHQUAKE OF CUTCH, INDIA, IN 1819\r\n\r\n\r\nCutch is one of the Provinces of India lying on the western coast of\r\nHindostan, east of the delta of the Indus River.\r\n\r\nA great earthquake occurred in this region on June 16th, 1819. As\r\nindicated by the map presented in Fig. 44, by Lyell, the district\r\nof Cutch lies on the coast of the Arabian Sea. Cutch is at times a\r\npeninsula, being washed on the south and east by the Arabian Sea and\r\nthe Gulf of Cutch, and on the north by a depression known as the Runn\r\nof Cutch which, during unusual tides, is overflowed by the waters of\r\nthe sea, but for the rest of the year is dry.\r\n\r\nThe earthquake of Cutch was apparently central at the town of Bhooj,\r\nwhere the destruction was extreme, hardly a house being left standing.\r\nThe shock extended over a radius of about 1,000 miles from Bhooj,\r\nreaching to Khatmandoo, Calcutta, and Pondicherry.\r\n\r\nAt Anjar the fort, together with its tower and guns, were completely\r\nruined. The shocks continued at intervals after the principal shock\r\nuntil June 20th, when the volcano of Denodur is said by some to have\r\nemitted flames, although this is denied by others.\r\n\r\nGreat changes were produced in the eastern channel of the Indus,\r\nwhich forms the western boundary of the Province of Cutch. The water\r\nin this inlet had become so low that it was readily fordable at low\r\ntide at Luckput, and was only covered with six feet of water at high\r\ntide. After the earthquake it deepened at the port of Luckput to over\r\neighteen feet at low tide, while in other parts of the channel the\r\nwater had deepened from four to ten feet at high tide, where before\r\nthe earthquake shock it had never been deeper than from one to two\r\nfeet. Indeed, after these changes the inland navigation of the country\r\nagain became possible after having been closed for many centuries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 44. MAP SHOWING DISTRICT VISITED BY THE\r\nEARTHQUAKE OF CUTCH OF 1819]\r\n\r\nThe Cutch earthquake resulted in a marked depression of the country,\r\nespecially north of Luckput, where the fort and village of Sindree\r\nwere so quietly sunk that the fort, with its tower and walls, was left\r\nprojecting slightly above a body of water that not only completely\r\ncovered the old site but also formed a large lake marked on the\r\npreceding map, at Sindree, by the dark shading. It was this change of\r\nlevel that deepened the eastern channel of the Indus, just mentioned.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG 45.. SINDREE BEFORE THE EARTHQUAKE OF\r\n1819]\r\n\r\nFig. 45, from Lyell, gives an idea of the appearance of the fort at\r\nSindree before the earthquake. The appearance of the fort after its\r\nsubmergence is represented in Fig. 46, where, as will be noticed, only\r\nthe top of the tower and the walls remain above the surface of the\r\nwater. That the masonry was not affected either by the earthquake, or\r\nby the inrush of waters, is evident from the fact that the ruins were\r\nstill standing in March, 1838, as represented in the figure.\r\n\r\nIn heavy shading on the map in Fig. 44 is a large area lying in the\r\nnorthern part of the province known as the Runn of Cutch. This is a\r\nflat region of about 7,000 square miles. It owes its level surface to\r\nits being the deserted or dried-up bed of a sea. For the greater part\r\nof the year its bottom is dry and hard, and is covered with a crust of\r\nsalt half an inch or so in thickness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 46. SINDREE AFTER THE EARTHQUAKE OF 1819]\r\n\r\nAccording to Lyell, from whom most of the facts concerning this\r\nearthquake have been obtained, the Runn of Cutch is connected with\r\na vast inland sea, not only by the water driven into it through the\r\nGulf of Cutch, but also through the eastern channel of the Indus at\r\nLuckput. These changes occur especially during the monsoon, when the\r\nseas are high, and especially after the heavy rains that come with\r\nthese winds, when the wet condition of the soil permits the sea water\r\nto spread rapidly.\r\n\r\nTraditions of the natives tend to confirm belief that Cutch a long\r\ntime ago was a true peninsula, and that the Runn of Cutch was then an\r\narm of the sea.\r\n\r\nThat a change of this character did occur in the Runn of Cutch seems\r\nto be proved by the ruins of old towns now far inland that are said to\r\nhave been ancient seaports, and as apparent evidences of this many\r\npieces of wrought iron and ships' nails have been found in parts of\r\nthe Runn.\r\n\r\nAt the same time that the sinking of the land around the fort and\r\nvillage of Sindree took place a considerable elevation occurred in the\r\nneighborhood. Immediately after the earthquake, the people in Sindree\r\nsaw that a low hill or mound had been thrown up in a place that before\r\nhad been a low and perfectly level plain. They named this elevation\r\nthe Ullah Bund, or _the Mound of God_, in order to distinguish it\r\nfrom several embankments that had been built directly across the\r\neastern mouth of the Indus; for the Ullah Bund had been raised by the\r\nearthquake across the same branch of the Indus.\r\n\r\nFor several years after the earthquake of 1819 marked changes kept\r\ndeveloping in the channels of the Indus. During 1826 a large body of\r\nwater entered into the eastern branch of the Indus above the Ullah\r\nBund and finally forced its way through the mound, thus establishing\r\na direct course to the sea. The Ullah Bund, being thus cut in two,\r\nan opportunity was afforded of seeing the materials of which it was\r\ncomposed. These were found to consist principally of clay filled with\r\nshells.\r\n\r\nThe opening of the river resulted in throwing such large quantities of\r\nfresh water into Lake Sindree that its waters were rendered fresh for\r\nseveral months, but at last regained their saltiness.\r\n\r\nDana states that in 1845 another earthquake occurred in this district\r\nwhich converted Sindree Lake into a salt marsh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\nTHE SAN FRANCISCO EARTHQUAKE OF APRIL 18, 1906\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout twelve minutes past five o'clock on the morning of the 18th of\r\nApril, 1906, the inhabitants of San Francisco were rudely awakened by\r\na few frightful earthquake shocks. Their houses were violently shaken\r\nto and fro, and on all sides were heard the awful crashings of falling\r\nwalls, chimneys, and buildings, together with the death-shrieks of\r\nthose caught in the ruins. Rushing madly into the streets they could\r\nsee on every side evidences of destruction; for, in almost every\r\ndirection, were heaps of fallen buildings, still being violently\r\nshaken by the earthquake waves that rapidly passed through the solid\r\nearth. Huge cracks or crevices had been formed in the streets, while\r\nthe heavy rails of the trolley tracks had been bent and twisted by the\r\nmighty forces.\r\n\r\nBefore describing in detail the great San Francisco earthquake, the\r\nlocation of the city and its surroundings demand consideration.\r\n\r\nAs can be seen from the map, Fig. 47, San Francisco is situated on the\r\nwestern coast of California, at the northern end of a peninsula, some\r\ntwenty miles in length and about six miles in width. This peninsula\r\nis formed by the magnificent Bay of San Francisco on the east, a\r\nnavigable strait called the Golden Gate on the north, and the Pacific\r\nOcean on the west.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 47. MAP OF WESTERN COAST OF CALIFORNIA SHOWING\r\nPOSITION OF SAN FRANCISCO]\r\n\r\nSan Francisco Bay, accessible by the Golden Gate, is the principal\r\nharbor on the Pacific Coast, and is, indeed, one of the most\r\nmagnificent harbors in the world. It is land-locked, that is,\r\nsurrounded by a continuous land border except at its entrance through\r\nthe Golden Gate. Including San Pablo Bay, it has a length of about\r\nfifty-five miles, and varies in breadth from three to twelve miles.\r\nThe entrance to the harbor, however, is impeded by a bar across the\r\nmouth of the Golden Gate, over which there is a depth of but thirty\r\nfeet of water at low tide.\r\n\r\nSan Francisco has over 750 miles of streets, 200 miles of which are\r\npaved. The city is lighted by both electricity and gas, and has an\r\nextensive system of water-works, the water being brought from the\r\nPilarcitos and Calaveras Creeks, situated from twenty to forty miles\r\nrespectively from the city.\r\n\r\nSan Francisco is in a region where earthquakes are common. It might,\r\ntherefore, be visited at any time by a great catastrophe. There have\r\noccurred between 1850 and 1888, no less than 254 earthquake shocks in\r\nthe State of California, these shocks having been especially frequent\r\nin the country surrounding San Francisco Bay. The most severe were\r\nthe earthquake of 1868, which injured San Francisco; the Owens Valley\r\nearthquake of 1872; the Vacaville earthquake of 1892; the Mare Island\r\nearthquake of 1898; and a smaller earthquake in 1900. Since 1900 there\r\nwas a period of rest until the 18th of April, 1906.\r\n\r\nAs in the case of practically all severe earthquakes, that which\r\ndestroyed San Francisco consisted of a few momentary shocks: then all\r\nwas over. According to a preliminary report of the State Earthquake\r\nCommission, appointed by the Governor of California, April 21st, 1906,\r\nthese shocks, as recorded in the observatory at Berkeley, began at\r\ntwelve minutes and six seconds after five A. M., Pacific\r\nStandard Time. Their entire duration was only one minute and fifty\r\nseconds, but, as frequently happens, there were a number of minor\r\nshocks, following at regular intervals during the next few hours as\r\nwell as the next few days.\r\n\r\nWhile the most severe shocks were in the neighborhood of the Peninsula\r\nof San Francisco, yet minor disturbances were felt as far north\r\nas Coos Bay, Oregon, and as far south as Los Angeles, California.\r\nAs shown by recording instruments at the seismograph station at\r\nWashington, D. C., Sitka, Alaska; Potsdam, Germany; and Tokio, Japan,\r\na series of waves were propagated through the earth, as well as over\r\nits periphery.\r\n\r\nThe damage done within the city limits was wide-reaching. Among the\r\nbuildings almost completely destroyed were the City Hall, on which\r\nabout $7,000,000 had been expended, the United States Post Office,\r\nbesides many business blocks, hotels, department stores, theatres,\r\nbanks, churches, and dwelling houses.\r\n\r\nAmid the terrors of such a calamity it is difficult to obtain\r\nobservations possessing any scientific value. Fortunately, however,\r\nthere was in the city a physicist trained to observe phenomena of this\r\ncharacter, Professor George Davidson of the University of California.\r\nLike others, he had been awakened by the first severe shock. At once\r\nrecognizing the nature of the phenomenon, and desirous of obtaining\r\nthe exact time of its occurrence, he counted seconds while he ran\r\ntowards the table on which he had placed his watch, and in this way\r\nestimated that the shock occurred at twelve minutes past five in\r\nthe morning. The closeness of this observation is emphasized by the\r\nfact that it differed from the recorded time by only six seconds. He\r\nstates that the motion, at the time of its greatest intensity, closely\r\nresembled that of a rat vigorously shaken by a terrier.\r\n\r\nThe destruction caused by the earthquake was, however, but a small\r\npart of the total loss to the city. Fires were almost immediately\r\nstarted in the ruined houses by the fires in the kitchens and other\r\nparts of the houses, by the ignited jets of the illuminating gas,\r\nand, perhaps, especially, by the crossing of numerous electric light\r\nwires.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which the woodwork and other combustible materials of\r\nthe buildings were loosely tossed together by the shocks helped the\r\nquick spread of the fires, and this, too, was probably greatly aided\r\nby the illuminating gas from the broken gas pipes and mains. Eight\r\nsevere conflagrations were, therefore, soon raging in different parts\r\nof the doomed city. What made these fires especially dangerous was the\r\nfact that the earthquake shocks had destroyed the water pipes. Thus\r\nthe firemen were handicapped in their heroic endeavors to extinguish\r\nthe flames.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the fire a strong wind was blowing from the northeast.\r\nSince the firemen were unable to check the flames, the fire line\r\nrapidly advanced. Its path led towards the best residential parts of\r\nthe city through portions of the mission section containing a dense\r\npopulation of poor people. The dwellings in this latter section\r\nconsisted of frame houses, through which the flames rapidly spread.\r\n\r\nThere was but one way to save the city from total destruction--a free\r\nuse of dynamite! This was intelligently employed until the supply gave\r\nout, when it seemed that the city was doomed to utter destruction.\r\nBut at the last moment, as it were, came a lucky change in the\r\ndirection of the wind. Instead of blowing from the northeast, the\r\nsteady southwest winds set in, and beat back the fire on itself, so by\r\nFriday, the 18th being Wednesday, it was under complete control and\r\nthe rest of the city was saved.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A SAN FRANCISCO PAVEMENT TORN BY THE\r\nEARTHQUAKE _From a Stereograph, Copyright, 1906, by Underwood &\r\nUnderwood_]\r\n\r\nThe extent of the fire is thus described in an article in the\r\n\"Outlook,\" for Saturday, April 28th, 1906, as follows:\r\n\r\n      \"The turn in the direction of the fire endangered for a\r\n      time the great Ferry House, at the foot of Market Street.\r\n      While the section actually destroyed is not, geographically\r\n      speaking, much more than one-third of the city limits,\r\n      yet it is in the heart of San Francisco, and includes the\r\n      chief business streets and the Mission District, inhabited\r\n      by poor people, and a large part of the so-called Nob Hill\r\n      Quarter, where were the finest and costliest residences of\r\n      the city. Another fine residence section, Civic Heights,\r\n      escaped, together with that known as the Western District.\r\n\r\n      \"The unburned district, though large in extent, was in\r\n      the nature of suburbs, and was not closely built up, so\r\n      that estimates made, as late as Saturday, declared that\r\n      three-fourths of San Francisco's improvements in real\r\n      estate had been destroyed.\"\r\n\r\nThe burnt district was about two miles from east to west and from two\r\nto four miles from north to south, with, of course, very irregular\r\noutlines.\r\n\r\nNaturally, the great destruction wrought by the earthquake of April\r\n18th, 1906, attracted the almost universal attention of scientific men\r\nespecially interested in earthquake phenomena. We are, therefore, able\r\nto speak authoritatively about the probable causes.\r\n\r\nThe great San Francisco earthquake of April 18th, 1906, appears to\r\nhave been a _tectonic_ quake. Ransome, in an article entitled, \"The\r\nProbable Cause of the San Francisco Earthquake,\" says:\r\n\r\n      \"The region thus amply fulfils the conditions under which\r\n      tectonic earthquakes arise. It is in unstable equilibrium,\r\n      and it is cut by long northwest faults into narrow blocks\r\n      which are in turn traversed by many minor dislocations.\r\n      Under the operation of the unknown forces of elevation and\r\n      subsidence, stresses are set up which finally overcome the\r\n      adhesion of the opposing walls of one or more of the fault\r\n      fissures; an abrupt slip of a few inches, or a few feet,\r\n      takes place and an earthquake results. The region extending\r\n      for some hundreds of miles north and south of the Bay of\r\n      San Francisco may be considered as particularly susceptible\r\n      to shocks on account of the number and magnitude of the\r\n      faults and the evidences that these furnish of very recent\r\n      slippings and the marked subsidence in the vicinity of the\r\n      Golden Gate.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\nSOME OTHER NOTABLE EARTHQUAKES\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would, of course, be impossible within the limits of this book to\r\nattempt a description of all the remarkable earthquakes in the annals\r\nof science; but before leaving this part of the theme a brief account\r\nof a few more among the many may be worth while.\r\n\r\nJamaica, one of the West Indian Islands, about ninety miles south of\r\nCuba, suffered a very destructive earthquake in 1692. During this\r\nearthquake the ground was agitated like the waves of the sea. These\r\nmovements were so violent that numerous fissures were made in the\r\nground, as many as 300 being formed at the same time, rapidly opening\r\nand closing. Many of the inhabitants were swallowed up in these\r\nfissures. In some cases, however, their bodies were afterward thrown\r\nout of the fissures, along with quantities of water.\r\n\r\nThe Jamaican earthquake was characterized by marked sinkings of the\r\nground. At the city of Port Royal, which was then the capital, many\r\nhouses on the harbor side sank in from twenty-four to forty-eight\r\nfeet of water. As in the case of the earthquake at Cutch, many of\r\nthese houses were left standing, the chimney tops of some being seen\r\nabove the water, with their foundations and other parts apparently\r\nuninjured, and some of them were standing at a date as late as 1780.\r\nAt a little later date, 1793, they were mostly ruins.\r\n\r\nDuring the Jamaican quake a tract of land containing at least 1,000\r\nacres near the town was sunk, and a wave of the sea rolled over it.\r\nThis wave is said by Lyell to have carried a frigate over the roofs of\r\nthe houses and left it stranded on one roof. When the wave rolled back\r\nto the sea, the weight of the frigate made it fall through the roof.\r\n\r\nPerhaps one of the most remarkable things about the Jamaican\r\nearthquake was the swallowing up of several plantations, which\r\ndisappeared, together with all their inhabitants, their former place\r\nbecoming a lake. But the lake soon disappeared, leaving a mass of sand\r\nand gravel which obliterated any least sign that dwellings and trees\r\nhad once adorned the spot.\r\n\r\nThe forces developed during this earthquake were sufficiently powerful\r\nto make several rents in the Blue Mountains, and the shock of blows on\r\nthe waters of the sea killed fish by the hundred thousands so that the\r\nsilver shine of their dead bodies stretched for miles and was beheld\r\nfor days \"on the face of the deep.\"\r\n\r\nPortions of the world that have been frequently visited by mighty\r\nearthquakes, are the coasts of Chile. On the 24th of May, 1751, a part\r\nof the Chilian coast near the ancient town of Concepcion, sometimes\r\ncalled Penco, was destroyed by an earthquake, and the powerful\r\nearthquake waves that afterwards rushed in from the sea. So complete\r\nwas this destruction that the ancient harbor was rendered useless and\r\nthe people had to build another town about ten miles from the coast,\r\nso as to be beyond the reach of earthquake waves from the sea.\r\n\r\nAnother great earthquake occurred on the coast of Chile on the\r\n19th of November, 1822. This shock was felt simultaneously over a\r\ndistance of 1,200 miles from north to south. It reached its greatest\r\nintensity about 100 miles north of Valparaiso. This earthquake caused\r\na rising of the coast to a height of from three to five feet. From\r\ncareful examinations it appears that the area over which a permanent\r\nelevation of the country took place must have been equal to 100,000\r\nsquare miles, an area equal to about half of the area of France, and\r\nfive-sixths that of Great Britain and Ireland.\r\n\r\n      \"If we suppose,\" says Dana, \"the elevation to have been\r\n      only three feet on an average, it will be seen that the\r\n      mass of rock added to the continent of America by the\r\n      movement, or, in other words, the mass previously below the\r\n      level of the sea, and after the shock, permanently above\r\n      it, must have contained fifty-seven cubic miles in bulk;\r\n      which would be sufficient to form a conical mountain two\r\n      miles high (or about as high as Etna) with a circumference\r\n      at the base of nearly thirty-three miles.... Assuming the\r\n      Great Pyramid of Egypt, if solid, to weigh in accordance\r\n      with the estimate before given 6,000,000 tons, we may\r\n      state that the rock added to the continent by the Chilian\r\n      earthquake would have equalled more than 100,000 pyramids.\r\n\r\n      \"But it must always be borne in mind that the weight of\r\n      rock here alluded to constituted but an insignificant\r\n      part of the whole amount which the volcanic forces had to\r\n      overcome. The thickness of rock between the surface of\r\n      Chile and the subterranean foci of volcanic action may be\r\n      many miles or leagues deep. Say that the thickness was only\r\n      two miles, even then the mass which changed place and rose\r\n      three feet, being 200,000 cubic miles in volume, must have\r\n      exceeded in weight 363,000,000 pyramids.\"\r\n\r\nThe shocks of this earthquake continued from the time of its\r\noccurrence, on November 19th, 1822, to the end of September, 1823, and\r\neven then there were scarcely two days that passed without a shock.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th of February, 1835, the same part of the world was in the\r\nthroes of an earthquake that was felt nearly 1,000 miles from north to\r\nsouth, or from near the town of Concepcion to the Isle of Chiloe, and\r\nfrom east to west a distance of about 500 miles, from Mendoza to the\r\nisland of Juan Fernandez, which you probably know better as Robinson\r\nCrusoe's Island. By this earthquake the new town of Concepcion and\r\nseveral other towns were partly destroyed.\r\n\r\nThere were the same phenomena connected with great sea waves that are\r\ncommon in earthquakes of this character. Both this and the preceding\r\nearthquakes probably began on the bed of the ocean at some distance\r\nfrom the coast; for, in the last earthquake, the sea retired from the\r\nBay of Concepcion and vessels were grounded that had been anchored\r\nin seven fathoms of water. Shortly afterwards waves from sixteen to\r\ntwenty feet in height rushed in from the ocean and swept over the land.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting in this connection to note that the volcanoes of the\r\nChilian Andes were in an unusual state of activity before, during, and\r\nafter the earthquake.\r\n\r\nAnother characteristic of this quake was the great number of severe\r\nshocks. Between the day of the first great shock; i. e., on February\r\n20th, 1835, and March 4th, there were more than 300 severe shocks.\r\n\r\nIn this as in the preceding quake a notable elevation of the land near\r\nthe coast occurred, amounting to from four to five feet, and a part of\r\nthe bed of the ocean near the coast was raised permanently above the\r\nlevel of the sea.\r\n\r\nIn the description of the explosive eruption of Krakatoa in 1883, the\r\nfact was noted that the island of Java is very frequently visited by\r\nearthquakes. Here a terribly severe earthquake occurred on the 5th of\r\nJanuary, 1699. There were no less than 208 shocks of great intensity.\r\nConsiderable property in the city of Batavia was destroyed, and a\r\nneighboring river, that has its head waters by a volcano near the\r\ncity, ran high and muddy and brought down multitudes of fishes that\r\nhad been killed, together with many buffaloes, tigers, rhinoceroses,\r\ndeer, and other wild beasts. Seven hills bordering on the river sank\r\ndown, damming up the streams of the region and thereby causing wide\r\ndestruction from floods.\r\n\r\nDuring portions of the years 1811 and 1812 an earthquake occurred\r\nin the United States, in the Mississippi Valley near the town of\r\nNew Madrid, Missouri, at the mouth of the Ohio River. These shocks\r\ncontinued almost incessantly for several months, and were accompanied\r\nby a sinking of the ground over large areas. This depressed area,\r\nknown in the neighborhood as _The Sunk Country_, extended along the\r\ncourse of the White Water River and its tributaries for a distance of\r\nabout eighty miles from north to south, and several miles from east\r\nto west. Most of it was converted into a marshy lake characterized by\r\nthousands of submerged trees. The area was covered for the greater\r\npart with water to a depth of about three to four feet.\r\n\r\nAs the earthquake shocks continued at intervals for several months\r\nthere was an ample opportunity for studying the peculiarities of the\r\nearth waves. The ground rose and fell like large waves in the sea, and\r\nafter the crest of the waves had reached great heights, the ground\r\nburst, and threw large quantities of water, sand, and earth into the\r\nair.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 48. NEW ZEALAND]\r\n\r\nThroughout the disturbed district there were numerous depressions\r\nknown as _sink-holes_, or irregularly shaped pits, varying from ten to\r\nthirty yards across, and having a depth of about twenty feet. These\r\nwere formed by the forcible ejection of large quantities of water\r\nmixed with sand.\r\n\r\nNew Zealand has been subject to earthquake shocks for a long time, the\r\nyears 1826, 1841, 1843, 1848, and 1855 being especially marked by such\r\nvisitations. It is a characteristic of the New Zealand earthquakes\r\nthat they have produced a marked change in the coast line. This was\r\nparticularly the case with those of 1848 and 1855.\r\n\r\nThe 23d of January, 1855, an earthquake occurred that was most violent\r\nin the narrowest part of Cook's Strait, a body of water separating\r\nthe two principal islands that constitute New Zealand; or, as they\r\nare called, the North Island and the South Island. These shocks were\r\nfelt at sea by ships 150 miles from the coast. The entire area shaken,\r\nincluding the water, has been estimated at three times the area of\r\nthe British Isles. In the vicinity of the southern shores of the\r\nNorth Island a tract of land having an area of 4,600 square miles is\r\nbelieved to have been permanently raised from one to nine feet.\r\n\r\nThe earthquakes in New Zealand are evidently of the tectonic type.\r\nDuring that of 1848 a rent or fissure was formed, which, though but\r\neighteen inches in average width, yet extended for a distance of sixty\r\nmiles in a direction parallel to one of the mountain chains.\r\n\r\nOn the 31st of August, 1886, an earthquake of considerable intensity\r\noccurred in the United States in the neighborhood of the city of\r\nCharleston, South Carolina. The details of this earthquake were\r\ncarefully studied by Major Dutton of the U. S. A., and published in\r\nthe Ninth Annual Report of the United States Geological Survey of 1888.\r\n\r\nCharleston is situated on a narrow tongue of land between the Ashley\r\nand the Cooper Rivers, about seven miles from the Atlantic Ocean.\r\nThere are in this area numerous creeks connected with the drainage of\r\nthese rivers. As the city limits extended, the creeks were filled in,\r\nforming \"made land,\" all buildings or structures erected on this land\r\nbeing supported by pilings.\r\n\r\nIt appears that the point at which the earthquakes started was\r\nsituated sixteen or seventeen miles from Charleston.\r\n\r\nThe earthquake shock affected a large area of the United States. Fig.\r\n49 shows curved lines called isoseismal connecting places, having the\r\nsame degree of seismic intensity. This map shows that these isoseimals\r\nare marked by figures or numbers from two to ten. These numbers are\r\nthe numbers of the Rossi-Forel earthquake scale. They indicate varying\r\ndegrees of intensity, beginning from the least intense shock which\r\nis marked as two and ending with the severest shock marked as ten.\r\nThere is one degree not marked on this map, the least, called the\r\nmicro-seismic shock.\r\n\r\nThe shocks then increase in intensity as follows: II. Extremely\r\nfeeble shocks; III. Very feeble shocks; IV. Feeble shocks; V. Shocks\r\nof moderate intensity; VI. Fairly strong shocks; VII. Strong shocks;\r\nVIII. Very strong shocks; IX. Extremely strong shocks; X. Shocks of\r\nextreme intensity.\r\n\r\nThe meaning of the map presented in the accompanying figure will now\r\nbecome more apparent in several ways. That portion numbered ten,\r\ndenoting where shocks of greatest intensity have been experienced,\r\nclearly indicates the region just above the point where the earthquake\r\noriginated.\r\n\r\nBeyond this is a region marked nine where the earthquake shock has\r\ndecreased in intensity to the next figure on the Rossi-Forel scale,\r\nand then to eight and a half, seven, six, five, four, three, and two.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 49. MAP SHOWING REGION AFFECTED BY THE\r\nCHARLESTON EARTHQUAKE OF 1886]\r\n\r\nThe Charleston earthquake damaged property to a considerable extent;\r\nfor, although comparatively few buildings were completely destroyed, a\r\nconsiderable number were partially injured, and many, not thrown down\r\nby the shock, had to be torn down in order to insure public safety.\r\nThe loss of life, fortunately, was comparatively small. During this\r\nearthquake a number of openings called _craterlets_ were made in the\r\nground by the forcible ejection of large quantities of water and sand.\r\n\r\nThe empire of Japan is another part of the world particularly subject\r\nto great as well as frequent earthquake shocks. Although Japan is also\r\nespecially noted for its volcanic activity, its earthquakes are almost\r\nentirely of the tectonic type, or are due to the slipping of the land\r\nat faults in the earth's crust. Most of these quakes occur on the bed\r\nof the ocean on the sides of a steep slope that extends down to a very\r\ndeep part of the Pacific known as the _Tuscarora Deep_.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th of October, 1891, Japan was visited by a great quake,\r\ngenerally known as the Mino-Owaro earthquake, from the name of the two\r\nprovinces of Mino and Owaro in which it occurred.\r\n\r\nThis earthquake is correctly regarded as one of the most severe in\r\nJapanese records. Originating, as it did, in a densely populated\r\nsection, it caused a great loss of life and property. The deaths\r\nreached about 7,000, while the number of houses entirely destroyed\r\nreached about 80,000 and those partly destroyed nearly 200,000. The\r\ntotal area markedly affected reached 250,000 square kilometres, while\r\nthe area sensibly affected reached 900,000 square kilometres, or a\r\nlittle more than one-half the Empire.\r\n\r\nThe place at which this earthquake started was situated, not as usual\r\non the bed of the ocean, but on the surface of the land. The first\r\nshock was the strongest and wrought the greatest havoc. Besides the\r\nloss of life and property, the damage to the system of dikes or levees\r\non the river where it passed through the delta plain near the river's\r\nmouth was heavy, and singular in some of its features. In one case,\r\nnear the city of Nagoya, on the Bay near the southern coast of Niphon,\r\none of these levees was lifted and shifted bodily more than sixty feet\r\nfrom its original position.\r\n\r\nThat this quake was of the tectonic type was evident from the great\r\nfault that was formed. According to Davison this fault was seventy\r\nmiles in length and in places had a breadth of from two to five feet.\r\nIt extended from east to west, crossing the entire width of the island.\r\n\r\nAnother great earthquake was that which hit northeastern Bengal and\r\nAssam in India on the 12th of June, 1897. According to the India\r\nGeological Survey, by whom a careful examination of the effects\r\nproduced by this quake was made, it was, perhaps, the greatest quake\r\nthat ever happened, not even excepting the Lisbon earthquake.\r\n\r\nThe place where the quake started appears to have been of unusual size\r\nand irregularity of outline. Its southern boundary was almost in the\r\nshape of a straight line extending from east to west about 200 miles,\r\nand covering a total area of nearly 6,000 square miles. Over all this\r\nvast area the intensity of the shock was exceedingly severe. The total\r\narea perceptibly shaken by the quake was about equal to 1,750,000\r\nsquare miles.\r\n\r\nThat this quake was of the tectonic type became evident, when several\r\nfaults were found in the ground afterwards. Some of these extended\r\ntwelve miles, with a breadth at places as great as thirty feet.\r\n\r\nValparaiso, or, as the name means, Vale of Paradise, the second\r\nlargest city of Chile and its chief seaport, lies about ninety\r\nmiles east of Santiago, the capital, with which it is connected by a\r\nrailroad.\r\n\r\nThis beautiful sea city is built at the base of a cluster of hills\r\nabout 1,600 feet above sea level. On August 16th, 1906, it was visited\r\nby an earthquake. There were two distinct shocks. Contrary to general\r\nrule it was not the first, but the second shock that did the most\r\ndamage, coming about ten minutes after the first. As you will see from\r\nthe above date the earthquake of Valparaiso occurred shortly after\r\nthe catastrophe of San Francisco. In a general way, its coming was\r\npredicted by Dr. G. F. Becker of the United States Geological Survey,\r\non April 19th, 1906, one day after the San Francisco disaster. Becker\r\npublished an article in the \"New York Tribune,\" in which he argued\r\nthat the severe shock at San Francisco, having occurred on one part\r\nof the earthquake region extending around the Pacific, would probably\r\nsoon affect other portions of this region along the Pacific coast line\r\nof this hemisphere.\r\n\r\nAs at San Francisco fierce fires immediately started in the ruins of\r\nthe houses, but the Valparaisans were more fortunate in having a water\r\nsupply available.\r\n\r\nThere were very many shocks following the first two of this\r\nearthquake. Indeed, during August 16th, 17th, 18th, and 19th, no less\r\nthan 380 were noted.\r\n\r\nSantiago, situated at the foot of the Andes, was also considerably\r\ndamaged by the same earthquake. Estimates, probably conservative, put\r\nthe total of dead in both cities at 1,000 and the number of people\r\nrendered homeless temporarily, at 100,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\nSODOM AND GOMORRAH AND THE CITIES OF THE PLAIN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe eastern border of the Mediterranean Sea or Syria, with that part\r\nof Arabia forming the Sinai Peninsula and which lies between the two\r\nnorthern arms of the Red Sea, is a region formerly characterized by\r\nextreme volcanic activity. This region includes the greater part of\r\nthe land promised, according to the Old Testament, to the Children\r\nof Israel. Through a large part of this region flows that historic\r\nriver, the Jordan, until it empties into the Dead Sea, also called the\r\nSalt Sea, the Sea of the Plain, and by some Lake Asphaltites because\r\nof asphalt or bitumen so abundant on its shores. This river has its\r\nsource in the Mountains of Lebanon, some distance north of the Sea of\r\nChinnerth, Tiberius, or the Sea of Galilee, which empties into the\r\nRiver Jordan.\r\n\r\nAs the map in Fig. 50 shows, this famous, though small river, flows\r\nbetween ranges of high hills, or low mountains, that lie on both its\r\neastern and western boundaries; and these parallel ranges extend\r\ndown to the Gulf of Akaba, which forms the eastern boundary of the\r\nSinai Peninsula. The Sea of Galilee, the valley of the Jordan and the\r\ncountry between the Dead Sea and the Gulf of Akaba, are all, for the\r\nmost part, considerably below the level of the Mediterranean or the\r\nRed Sea; the Sea of Galilee being about 626 feet and the Dead Sea 1312\r\nfeet below that line.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 50. SYRIA]\r\n\r\nThat this country has been the scene of great volcanic activities is\r\nevident from the volcanic rocks found over different portions of its\r\nsurface. Moreover, the remains of several craters are still visible.\r\nOn the western banks of the Jordan numerous dikes and streaks of\r\nbasalt occur in the limestone that covers parts of the region. Besides\r\nthere are thermal springs whose waters are at a temperature, according\r\nto Daubeny, of 114° F. Then, too, in the neighborhood of the Dead\r\nSea, as well as in the neighborhood of the adjoining mountain ranges,\r\nthere are quantities of sulphur and asphaltum or bitumen, while on the\r\nDead Sea asphaltum is found floating in sufficient quantity to be a\r\nsource of considerable revenue to the boatmen who collect it. It was\r\nin this region that Sodom, Gomorrah, and other cities of the plain\r\nwere situated; cities so wicked that God utterly destroyed them by\r\nvolcanoes and earthquakes.\r\n\r\nVolcanic activity was evidently common in this land of the Bible\r\nduring the times of the prophets of Israel; for in their poetic\r\nwritings are frequent references to such phenomena--beautiful and\r\nmajestic similes and metaphors derived from contemplation of live\r\nvolcanoes.\r\n\r\nJeremiah says:\r\n\r\n      \"Behold, I am against thee, O devouring mountain, saith the\r\n      Lord, which destroyeth all the earth; and I will stretch\r\n      out mine hand upon thee, and roll thee down from the rocks,\r\n      and will make thee a burnt[4] mountain.\r\n\r\n      \"And they shall not take of thee a stone for a corner,\r\n      nor a stone for foundations; but thou shalt be desolate\r\n      forever, saith the Lord.\" (Jer. li, 25-26.)\r\n\r\nSo, too, the prophet Isaiah says:\r\n\r\n      \"Oh that thou wouldst rend the heavens, that thou wouldst\r\n      come down, that the mountains might flow down at thy\r\n      presence!\r\n\r\n      \"As when the melting fire burneth, the fire causeth the\r\n      water to boil, to make thy name known to thine adversaries,\r\n      that the nations may tremble at thy presence!\r\n\r\n      \"When thou didst terrible things which we look not for,\r\n      thou cameth down, the mountains flowed down at thy\r\n      presence.\" (Is. lxiv, 1-2.)\r\n\r\nSo, too, the prophet Nahum says:\r\n\r\n      \"The mountains quake at him, and the hills melt, and the\r\n      earth is burned at his presence, yea, the world, and all\r\n      that dwell therein.\r\n\r\n      \"Who can stand before his indignation? And who can abide in\r\n      the fierceness of his anger? His fury is poured down like\r\n      fire, and the rocks are thrown down by him.\" (Nahum, i,\r\n      5-6.)\r\n\r\nLet us now examine briefly the description Moses gives of the\r\ndestruction of Sodom, Gomorrah, and other cities of the plain. This\r\ndestruction occurred during the life time of Abraham and his nephew\r\nLot. The record says that God told Abraham He intended to destroy\r\nthem because of their wickedness. Then follows in the 18th chapter\r\nof Genesis the eloquent pleading of Abraham for one of the doomed\r\ncities. At Abraham's earnest plea God promises to spare Sodom if\r\nfifty righteous men can be found therein. Obtaining this respite,\r\nAbraham repeatedly asks further mercy for the city, and at last\r\nreceives the sacred promise that the city shall not be destroyed, if\r\nbut ten righteous people can be found there. An evidence of the great\r\nwickedness of the city is seen in the fact that not even ten could be\r\nfound. Whereupon the Lord gives notice to Lot that the cities were\r\ndoomed and commands Lot to leave at once with his family.\r\n\r\n      \"Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay\r\n      thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be\r\n      consumed!\"\r\n\r\nMoses describes what happened as follows:\r\n\r\n      \"The sun was risen upon the earth, when Lot entered into\r\n      Zoar.\r\n\r\n      \"Then the Lord rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah\r\n      brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven;\r\n\r\n      \"And he overthrew those cities and all the plain, and all\r\n      the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the\r\n      ground.\r\n\r\n      \"But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a\r\n      pillar of salt.\r\n\r\n      \"And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where\r\n      he stood before the Lord:\r\n\r\n      \"And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all\r\n      the land of the plain, and beheld, and lo, the smoke of\r\n      the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.\" (Gen. xix,\r\n      23-28).\r\n\r\nThis is clearly the description of a volcanic eruption, for throughout\r\nthe Bible things are described as they appear to be. When Moses speaks\r\nof brimstone and fire being rained upon Sodom and Gomorrah out of\r\nheaven, he is describing the phenomenon as it would appear to one\r\nlooking at it. Of course, we know that in volcanic eruptions such\r\nthings come to the earth through the crater of the volcano. The lava\r\nis thrown high into the air, and the hardening, but still red hot,\r\nashes, rain down on the earth from the ash cloud that forms over the\r\nmountain. But, looked at from a distance they appear to fall or be\r\nrained down from the skies. In exactly the same way, Livy, the Roman\r\nhistorian, tells about showers of stones that fell from heaven on\r\nMt. Albano near Rome for two whole days during the second Punic War.\r\nSo, too, even Pliny, who had some pretensions to be considered a\r\nnaturalist, in describing the appearance of Mt. Vesuvius during the\r\nterrible eruption of A. D. 79, when Herculaneum and Pompeii\r\nwere destroyed, speaks of the red hot stones and ashes as falling\r\nfrom above. So, in reality, they did, although, as in the case of the\r\ncities of the plain, the materials forming the cloud came from the\r\ncrater of the volcano below.\r\n\r\nAs to brimstone falling from the sky, this is by no means an unusual\r\noccurrence during many volcanic eruptions, since sulphur is a common\r\nmaterial, often thrown out of the craters of some volcanoes.\r\n\r\nNote also the statement that, when Abraham rose early in the morning\r\nand looked toward the place where Sodom and Gomorrah stood, he saw\r\nthe smoke of the country go up like the smoke of a furnace. This was,\r\nprobably, the smoke caused by the burning of the city, or even by the\r\ndestruction of the crops in their fields, when ignited by the falling\r\nred hot ashes. It might also have been partly due to the burning of\r\nasphalt thrown out from the fissures in the ground, or to the showers\r\nof volcanic ashes that fell from the cloud formed during the eruption.\r\n\r\nThat the cities there were destroyed by a volcano far in the past\r\nappears from things outside of the Bible proper; for Strabo,\r\nthe Greek geographer, refers to Jewish traditions that thirteen\r\nflourishing cities were swallowed up by a volcano, and this finds fair\r\ncorroboration in the ruins along the western borders of the Dead Sea.\r\n\r\nA writer referring to these eruptions says:\r\n\r\n      \"The eruptions themselves have ceased long since, but the\r\n      effects, which usually succeed them, still continue to be\r\n      felt at intervals in this country. The coast in general is\r\n      subject to earthquakes, and history notes several which\r\n      have changed the face of Antioch, Laodicea, Tripoli,\r\n      Berytus, Tyre, and Sidon. In 1793 there happened one which\r\n      spread the greatest ravages. It is said to have destroyed\r\n      in the valley of Balbec upwards of 20,000 persons.\"\r\n\r\nAttention has already been called to the fact that the valley of the\r\nJordan occupies a depressed or sunken region far below the level\r\nof the Mediterranean and the Red Seas. It is the belief of some\r\ngeologists that this depression was caused by an earthquake which\r\naccompanied the volcanic eruption that destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah\r\nand the cities of the plain. Indeed, some contend that the present\r\nsite of the valley of the Jordan, including the Sea of Tiberius and\r\nthe Dead Sea, is a great fissure that was made in the limestone of the\r\nvalley during the time of that earthquake.\r\n\r\nIt would appear from the peculiar geography of this section of country\r\nthat the Jordan River has not always emptied into the Dead Sea, but\r\nthat before the time of the destruction of the Cities of the Plain the\r\ngreater part of the country now occupied by the Dead Sea was a fertile\r\nvalley, and the Jordan emptied directly into the Red Sea at the Gulf\r\nof Akaba; that during the disturbance through changes in the valley,\r\nor possibly by a lava stream flowing across a portion of the bed of\r\nthe lower Jordan, or even by a huge accumulation of stones or ashes\r\nthrown out from a neighboring volcano, the discharge of the river into\r\nthe Red Sea was cut off, and that in this way the waters of the rivers\r\nbegan to accumulate and to flow over the plain, thus forming the basin\r\nof the Dead Sea.\r\n\r\nThere is no difficulty in accounting for the saltness of the Dead\r\nSea. There are large quantities of salt, and salty matters generally,\r\nin the volcanic rocks of the region, but, even if this were not so,\r\nwhen a river empties into a lake with no outlet to the sea, and\r\nwhich therefore loses its water by evaporation only, the water will\r\ngradually become very salt, since the remaining waters of such a lake\r\ncontain more or less salt, while the water they lose by evaporation\r\ncontains none.\r\n\r\nThe waters of the Dead Sea are very salt, but not the saltest in\r\nthe world. In every 100 pounds of Dead Sea water twenty-four pounds\r\nconsist of salty matters. The waters of the Great Salt Lake, in Utah,\r\ncontain eighteen per cent of salty matters. Lake Van, in eastern\r\nTurkey, is, perhaps, the saltest lake on earth, it containing no less\r\nthan thirty-three pounds of salty substances in every 100 pounds of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nDaubeny, an authority on volcanoes, and quite competent to give an\r\nopinion concerning what is possible in this line, describes what he\r\nbelieves took place, as follows:\r\n\r\n      \"Briefly then to recapitulate the train of phenomena by\r\n      which the destruction of the cities might have been brought\r\n      about, I would suppose that the River Jordan, prior to\r\n      that event, continued its course tranquilly through the\r\n      great longitudinal valley, called El Arabah, into the\r\n      Gulf of Akaba; that a shower of stones and sand from some\r\n      neighboring volcano first overwhelmed these places; and\r\n      that its eruption was followed by a depression of the whole\r\n      of the region, from some point apparently intermediate\r\n      between the lake of Tiberius and the mountains of Lebanon,\r\n      to the watershed in the parallel of 30°, which occurs in\r\n      the valley of El Arabah above-mentioned. I would thence\r\n      infer that the waters of the Jordan, pent-up within the\r\n      valley by a range of mountains to the east and west, and a\r\n      barrier of elevated table-land to the south, could find no\r\n      outlet, and consequently by degrees formed a lake in its\r\n      most depressed portion, which, however, did not occur at\r\n      once, and therefore is not recorded by Scripture as a part\r\n      of the catastrophe, though reference is made in another\r\n      passage of its existence _in what was before the valley of\r\n      Siddim_.\"\r\n\r\nAs regards the turning of Lot's wife into a pillar of salt, Henderson,\r\nwho has carefully studied this part of the country, remarks: \"How\r\nnatural is the incrustation of his wife on this hypothesis! Remaining\r\nin a lower part of the valley, and looking with a wistful eye towards\r\nSodom, she was surrounded, ere she was aware, by the lava, which\r\nrising and swelling, at length reached her, and (whilst the volcanic\r\neffluvia deprived her of life) incrusted her where she stood, so that\r\nbeing, as it were, embalmed by the salso-bituminous mass, she became a\r\nconspicuous beacon and admonitory example of future generations.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\nINSTRUMENTS FOR RECORDING AND MEASURING EARTHQUAKE SHOCKS\r\n\r\n\r\nTo attempt by the unaided senses a determination of the direction in\r\nwhich earthquake shocks reach any certain spot, the velocity with\r\nwhich they are travelling, their degree of intensity, their general\r\ncharacter, whether horizontal or vertical, or any peculiarities which\r\nmight show them to be exceptional would be futile for more reasons\r\nthan one. Even a skilled scientific observer, familiar with what has\r\nalready been discovered and eager to discover more, might in the\r\nexcitement of an earthquake become so excited himself as to make him\r\nunable to take reliable observations.\r\n\r\nBut human ingenuity has succeeded in devising delicate instruments\r\ncapable of recording not only the exact time of the arrival of an\r\nearthquake shock, but also of measuring the different parts of what\r\nmay seem to be a single shock, the direction in which the shocks reach\r\nthe place, as well as the variations of intensity in all the shocks.\r\n\r\nCrude instruments to do some of these things have been in use from\r\nvery early times. According to Mallet among the more important\r\nof these early instruments was the following: the instrument of\r\nCacciatore of Palmero. This consisted of a circular wooden dish, about\r\nten inches in diameter, placed horizontally, and filled with mercury\r\nto the brim of eight notches at equal distances apart. Beneath each\r\nnotch was placed a small cup. On the passage of the earthquake waves\r\nthe vessel, being tilted in a direction dependent on the direction in\r\nwhich the waves were travelling, would cause some of the mercury to\r\nspill over into one or more of the cups, thus indicating by its amount\r\nthe intensity of the wave, and by the particular cup or cups that were\r\nfilled, the direction in which the waves reached the place.\r\n\r\nSomewhat similar contrivances were of a vessel partly filled with\r\nmolasses, or other sticky liquid; or a cylindrical tub, the sides of\r\nwhich were chalked or whitewashed and filled with some colored liquid.\r\nIn either of these cases, on the passage of the earthquake waves,\r\nthe vessels were tilted and showed by the height of the marks the\r\nintensity of the waves, and by the position of the marks the direction\r\nin which the waves first reached the instrument.\r\n\r\nThese instruments, though satisfactory for the study of earthquake\r\nshocks a long time ago, when an earthquake was regarded as practically\r\nconsisting of but a single shock, or, at the most, of a very few\r\nshocks, would be worthless for the study of earthquakes now, for it is\r\nfinally known that an earthquake consists of a series of many hundreds\r\nof vibrations, differing greatly in their rapidity and intensity, and\r\nfollowing one another in a definite order.\r\n\r\nThe old forms of earthquake instruments were known as _seismoscopes_.\r\nThe word seismoscope is a compound word from Greek consisting of\r\nthe two words, seism and scope. It means literally any instrument\r\ncapable of seeing, or calling attention to, a seism, or _earth-shake_.\r\nIn other words, a seismoscope is any instrument capable of calling\r\nattention only to an earth-shake.\r\n\r\nOf course, neither of the rude seismoscopes just mentioned would be\r\nable to give any valuable indications of the successive shakings to\r\nwhich the vessel containing the viscid liquid had been subjected,\r\nsince the liquid would simply be splashed a number of times over the\r\nsame parts of the vessel. In order to get a record of the successive\r\nshocks another form of apparatus must be employed, a form known as a\r\n_seismograph_.\r\n\r\nConcerning the complex character of the apparently single earthquake\r\nshock, Professor Milne makes this highly interesting and picturesque\r\nstatement:\r\n\r\n      \"An earthquake disturbance at a station far removed from\r\n      its origin shows that the main movement has two attendants,\r\n      one which precedes and the other which follows. The first\r\n      of these by its characteristics indicates what is to\r\n      follow, whilst the latter, in a very much more pronounced\r\n      manner, will often repeat at definite intervals, but with\r\n      decreasing intensity, the prominent features of what\r\n      has passed. Inasmuch as these latter rhythmical, but\r\n      decreasing, impulses of the dying earthquake are more\r\n      likely to result from reflection than from interference, I\r\n      have provisionally called them Echoes.\"\r\n\r\nThere are many different forms of instruments known as seismographs\r\nthat are capable of recording all of these vibrations, but there is\r\nthis objection to their use: that the records appear in so tangled a\r\nform that it is practically impossible to decipher or untangle them.\r\nThis fact can be grasped by examining Fig. 51, which represents a\r\nrecord of this kind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 51. COMPLEX RECORD OF SEISMOGRAPH]\r\n\r\nIt is necessary, therefore, to employ a modified form of instrument\r\ncalled a _seismometer_, able not only to record all the different\r\nvibrations, but to record them in such a manner that they can be\r\neasily recognized. Fig. 52, for example, shows results obtained by the\r\nuse of a seismometer, in which the different vibrations are separated,\r\nand so recorded on a sheet of paper, as to be readily understood. Such\r\na record is called a _seismogram_, and represents a _long distance\r\nseismogram_. Here the large arrow indicates the beginning of the\r\nrecord. And herein, as can be clearly seen, what would appear to an\r\nobserver without an instrument only a single shock, lasting but the\r\nfraction of a minute, in reality consists of the _preliminary shake_\r\nas represented in ab and bc, the _principal shake_, as represented\r\nat c, d1, d2, and d3, and the _final portions of the shake_ or the\r\n\"echoes\" of Professor Milne, as represented from d3 to e.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 52. LONG DISTANCE SEISMOGRAM]\r\n\r\nExcept in a very general way there is for present purposes no need\r\nof explaining the construction and operation of the seismometer\r\nand seismograph. Suffice it to say, there are many forms of these\r\ninstruments, any of which are capable of recording the details of a\r\npassing shock. The most important thing in either a seismograph or a\r\nseismometer is to obtain what is known as a _steady point_; that is, a\r\npoint consisting of some object or mass that will remain practically\r\nat rest, while everything around it, even the support which holds it,\r\nis affected by the earthquake.\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, not very easy to obtain a steady point, but it can\r\nbe done; and it will be at once comprehended that if a plate or piece\r\nof paper were attached to such a steady point or mass, and a pencil\r\nor tracer had one of its ends resting on the plate, and its other end\r\nattached to the support that vibrates with the earth, a tracing or\r\nrecord would be drawn on the plate from which the character of the\r\nmotion of the end of the tracer, and, therefore, of the earth, would\r\nbe marked on the plate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 53. VICENTINI VERTICAL PENDULUM]\r\n\r\nVarious devices have been employed for the steady points. The most\r\nsuccessful consists of a heavy mass of lead.\r\n\r\nFig. 53 represents a form of instrument invented by Professor\r\nVicentini of Italy. Here the steady point consists of a heavy leaden\r\nbob, of 200, 400, or even 500 kilograms, suspended by three metallic\r\nrods united above by a brass cap, hung on a steel wire to a bracket\r\nfixed on the wall. This wire may have a length as great as fifty feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 54. VICENTINI PENDULUM AND RECORDER]\r\n\r\nFig. 54 represents the recording instrument. Here a tracer is provided\r\nthat is capable of multiplying the motion fifty times, or even eighty\r\ntimes. A record is traced on a sheet of paper passing over a roller\r\nwhich imparts a rapid motion to a sheet so as to make sure that the\r\ndifferent parts of the shock or vibration will be recorded on separate\r\nportions of the paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\nSEAQUAKES\r\n\r\n\r\nAs earthquakes are shakings of the earth's crust in places where it is\r\nuncovered by the waters of the ocean, so _seaquakes_ are the shakings\r\nof those portions that lie on the bed of the ocean.\r\n\r\nMallet points out that the earthquake wave may start either in the\r\ninterior of the continent, or on the bed of the ocean; that the latter\r\nplace is the more common, since on the land vents--rude safety-valves,\r\nas it were,--are provided by the craters of the volcanoes; that, when\r\nearthquakes start on the ocean bed, the impulses are conveyed in\r\ndifferent forms of waves, i. e., those through the solid earth, those\r\nthrough the water, and those through the air, with varying sounds like\r\nbellowings and explosions, or like the rolling of wagons over rough\r\nroads.\r\n\r\nTo learn when quakes occur on the sea is a much harder task, since on\r\nthe land we can use seismoscopes, seismographs, or seismometers to\r\nindicate, record, or measure the shakings of the crust, while on the\r\nsea, where the water is always in more or less motion and the surface\r\nso far from the ocean's bed this is impossible, or, rather shall it\r\nbe said, has hitherto been found so; for that the mind of man may\r\nsurmount this obstacle is not impossible to conceive.\r\n\r\nTo detect the wave produced by the quaking of the bed of the ocean\r\nis exceedingly difficult, since those in very deep water are flat or\r\npossess but a small height. Indeed, in the deepest parts of the ocean\r\nthis height is probably to be measured only by inches instead of feet.\r\nWhen, however, the waves advance towards the shore they increase in\r\nheight, and when they reach the shallows near the coast, they begin\r\nto curl over and break, thus creating the enormous waves mentioned so\r\noften as attending great earthquakes in the ocean.\r\n\r\nDuring the great earthquake of Simoda in Japan, 1854, the waters of\r\nthe bay were first greatly agitated, and then retreated, leaving the\r\nbottom bare in places where the water was formerly thirty feet deep. A\r\nwave, thirty feet high, then rushed in from the bay and, climbing the\r\nland, swept away everything in its path, covering the town with water\r\nto the tops of the houses. This monster wave then receded, but rushed\r\nback five times.\r\n\r\nIn 1751, an earthquake wave suddenly entered Callao, the port of Lima,\r\nPeru, sinking twenty-three vessels and driving a frigate inland, where\r\nit was left high and dry. This wave extended across the Pacific to the\r\nHawaiian Islands, a distance of 6,000 miles.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th of August, 1866, an earthquake wave, that started a short\r\ndistance from shore, produced a number of earthquake waves sixty feet\r\nhigh that reached the coast of Peru half an hour after the principal\r\nearthquake shock. These waves reached Coquimbo, 800 miles distant,\r\nin about three hours, and Honolulu, on the Sandwich Islands, 5,520\r\nmiles distant, in twelve hours, and the coast of Japan, more than\r\n10,000 miles distant, on the next day. Le Conte remarks that these\r\nwaves would have encircled the earth, had it not been for the barrier\r\ninterposed by the Andes.\r\n\r\nAnother great seaquake, known as the Iquiqui seaquake, during 1868 in\r\nthe same neighborhood damaged severely the towns of north Chile and\r\nsouthern Peru.\r\n\r\nWhile, however, there is difficulty in readily observing the\r\nearthquake waves that form in the deep ocean, yet such is at times the\r\nviolence of an earthquake that there is no difficulty in detecting its\r\npresence, even in deep water. Dr. Rudolph has made a careful study of\r\nthe evidences of earthquakes produced in the deep sea, from a careful\r\nexamination of a great number of the logs of ships. Logs, as everybody\r\nknows, are books in which the captain or commanding officer makes\r\ncareful entries of all important happenings to the vessel, conditions\r\nof the weather and of the sea. From this source Dr. Rudolph obtained\r\nconsiderable information of much value concerning these phenomena.\r\n\r\nI have already called your attention to portion of the Atlantic Ocean\r\nlying near the Equator, in the warmest part of the ocean, between\r\nAfrica and South America, as being a region especially liable to\r\nsubmarine volcanic showers. While, generally speaking, there is\r\nnothing in this region to indicate the probability of submarine\r\ndisturbance, yet suddenly, if a vessel happens to pass directly over\r\nthe point of origin of the quake, there ensues a great quaking or\r\nquivering. Loose objects on the ship begin to shake and clatter.\r\nNoises arise from some invisible point deep down in the ocean. The\r\ndisturbance grows, the noises begin to resemble distant thunder, the\r\nship trembles and staggers as though it had struck rocks, and many\r\nbelieve she is about to go down; when, as suddenly as it began, the\r\ncommotion ceases, the noises stop, and the ship shapes her course as\r\ncalmly, and as gallantly, as before.\r\n\r\nRudolph gives two excellent examples of seaquakes in this region, both\r\nof which were, doubtless, due to submarine eruptions.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th of January, 1859, as the ship _Florence_ was in lat.\r\n0° 48' N., long. 29° 16' W., about ten miles N. W. by N. from St.\r\nPaul's Rock, the people on board felt a sudden shock that began with a\r\nrumbling sound like distant thunder. This lasted only forty seconds.\r\nThe glass and dishes of the vessel rattled so violently that it was\r\nfeared they would be broken. The shakings were so strong that several\r\nobjects on the vessel were thrown down. Everyone believed the ship\r\nhad struck on rocks. The captain leaned over the taffrail in order to\r\nsee the position of the reef, but soon saw that the vessel had struck\r\nnothing, and informed his crew \"it was only an earthquake shock.\"\r\n\r\nAnother of the log books examined by Rudolph was that of a ship in the\r\nsame part of the Atlantic Ocean. This record showed that suddenly on\r\na morning, in 1883, strange noises were heard that soon increased and\r\nbecame not unlike the firing of great guns or the peals of distant\r\nthunder. The ship vibrated as if its anchor had been suddenly let go,\r\nand at the same time a feeling came over all the crew, as if they had\r\nbeen electrified.\r\n\r\nIn some cases the vibrations were sufficiently severe to throw heavy\r\nobjects from the deck, as appears in an account given by a French\r\ngeologist of a quake in the Mediterranean off the shores of Asia Minor.\r\n\r\n\"Our ship was over the epicentre,\"[5] he says, \"and was so severely\r\nshaken that at first the Admiral feared the complete destruction of\r\nthe corvette.\" He then makes the statement that the shocks which were\r\ndirectly upwards were so strong as to throw heavy objects in the air;\r\nfor example, a heavy gun and its carriage. While it is possible, as\r\nDutton remarks, that this incident of the heavy gun and carriage was\r\ngrossly exaggerated, yet it should not be forgotten that in the case\r\nof submarine eruptions such as that which resulted in the production\r\nof the island of Sabrina, an immense column of water, weighing\r\nprobably many times more than a gun and its carriage, was observed to\r\nbe shot high into the air.\r\n\r\nWhere the seaquake is produced by a strong submarine volcanic\r\neruption, there is a violent commotion of the water itself, so that a\r\nvessel passing over such a point may be greatly injured, and, indeed,\r\neven destroyed. Such disasters, however, are fortunately exceedingly\r\nrare.\r\n\r\nAmong other common effects of seaquakes is the destruction of fish\r\nalready mentioned by the sudden blow to the water stunning and killing\r\nthem, just as the explosion of dynamite or other high explosives does\r\nin a lake or pond.\r\n\r\nThe most marked effect, however, of seaquakes is the starting of the\r\ngreat wave on the coasts of continents and islands.\r\n\r\nThere are certain parts of the ocean that are especially liable to\r\nseaquakes. Some of the more important of these, as shown by Rudolph's\r\nresearches, are:\r\n\r\nThe region already referred to in the narrowest parts of the Atlantic\r\nOcean between Africa and South America almost immediately under the\r\nequator. Here there are two well marked regions. One is in lat. 1°\r\nN., long. 30° W., where there is a submarine ridge, the tops of which\r\nform what are known as St. Paul's Rock. The ocean here is very deep,\r\nthe slopes of the ridge descending rapidly. It is on these slopes\r\nthat earthquakes are very apt to occur just as they do on the steep\r\nslopes of mountain ranges. The other region, called by Rudolph the\r\n_Equatorial District_, lies a little further to the east on both sides\r\nof the equator in long. 20° W.\r\n\r\nIt appears from Rudolph's researches that between 1845 and 1893 no\r\nless than thirty-seven seaquakes were reported in the logs of ships\r\nin the neighborhood of St. Paul's Rock, and between 1747 and 1890, in\r\nthe equatorial district, there were forty-nine seaquakes. It must not\r\nbe supposed, however, that these were all the quakes in the regions\r\nduring these times, since, of course, many shocks must have happened\r\nthat were not felt even by vessels in the neighborhood and many more,\r\nwhen this portion of the ocean was free from any craft.\r\n\r\nIn the North Atlantic there is a portion of the ocean's bed known as\r\nthe _West Indies Deep_. Here the bed is marked by great depths and by\r\nmany irregularities and is, therefore, a region where seaquakes are\r\ncommon.\r\n\r\nStill another district is found in the North Atlantic in the\r\nneighborhood of the Azores. This is the region in which the Lisbon\r\nearthquake is believed to have started.\r\n\r\nAnother region where seaquakes are common is in the Pacific along the\r\ncoast of South America from the equator to 45° S. lat. \"Here,\" says\r\nDutton, \"especially in the vicinity of the angle where the Peruvian\r\nand Chilian coasts meet have they been most numerous and formidable.\r\nThe harbors of Pisco, Arica, Tacua, Iquiqui, and Pisago have been\r\nrepeatedly subject to these destructive invasions.\"\r\n\r\nThere has been considerable discussion as to the exact manner in which\r\nthe earthquake waves are set up. Whatever be the cause or causes,\r\nthe action must be sudden, such as an upheaval of the bottom, or a\r\ncollapse of a large section of the ocean's bed, with a dropping of a\r\nvast body of water. Or, possibly, a submarine volcanic eruption causes\r\nthe water to lift suddenly under pressure of steam generated by escape\r\nof the lava and other hot volcanic products.\r\n\r\nDr. Rudolph attributes earthquake waves to submarine volcanic\r\neruptions alone. It would seem, however, as if each one of the other\r\nthings above referred to might at times be the direct cause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\nTHE DISTRIBUTION OF EARTHQUAKES\r\n\r\n\r\nEarthquakes may occur at any part of the earth's surface, at any time\r\nof the day, or at any season of the year, yet they are more frequent\r\nat certain parts, certain hours, certain seasons.\r\n\r\nSince some earthquakes are unquestionably connected with volcanic\r\neruptions, a map or chart of the volcanoes of the earth would also,\r\nto a certain extent, show the parts of the earth that are likely to\r\nbe visited by earthquakes. Since, however, by far the most severe\r\nearthquakes are not directly connected with volcanoes, but are due to\r\nsudden slips of faulted strata, a volcanic chart would necessarily\r\nfail to indicate accurately the principal earthquake regions.\r\n\r\nIn the preparation of a map showing the distribution of earthquakes\r\nover the earth's surface, Mallet adopted the plan of colorings or\r\ntintings in such a manner that the depth of the colors would represent\r\nnot only the parts shaken, but also the relative number of times\r\nshaken, as well as the intensity of the shocks. In order to determine\r\nthe depth of tint to be employed, Mallet divided earthquakes into the\r\nfollowing classes according to their intensity:\r\n\r\n_Great earthquakes_, or earthquakes of the first class; or those in\r\nwhich the area affected is of great size, in which many cities have\r\nbeen overthrown, and many people killed, and parts of the surface\r\ngreatly altered.\r\n\r\n_Intermediate earthquakes_, or those in which, although the area\r\naffected is great, yet the destruction of buildings, or loss of life,\r\nhas been comparatively small.\r\n\r\n_Minor earthquakes_, or those which, although capable of producing\r\nsmall fissures in the crust, generally leave but few or no traces of\r\ntheir occurrence.\r\n\r\nThe greatest distance to which earthquake waves of the first class\r\nextend is taken by Mallet as being over a diameter of 1,080 miles;\r\nthose of the second class over a diameter of about 360 miles, and\r\nthose of the third class over a diameter of about 120 miles.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Rossi Forel scale already given, earthquake shocks\r\nare divided according to their relative intensity into ten separate\r\nclasses, viz.: I. The micro-seismic; II. The extremely feeble; III.\r\nThe very feeble; IV. The feeble; V. The moderately intense; VI.\r\nThe fairly strong; VII. The strong; VIII. The very strong; IX. The\r\nextremely strong; X. Shocks of extreme intensity.\r\n\r\nAn earthquake map prepared according to Mallet's scale would show a\r\ngreater depth of color or tint in the neighborhood of the volcanic\r\ndistricts of the earth and especially in the neighborhood of the\r\nmountain regions, where tectonic quakes are most frequent. Oceanic\r\nareas would be left almost untinted, not because earthquakes do not\r\noccur on the bed of the ocean, but because of the difficulty of\r\nobserving such earthquakes at great distances from the land. So far\r\nfrom earthquakes being absent on the bed of the ocean it is most\r\nprobable that they are more frequent there than elsewhere.\r\n\r\nPrepared in this way, Mallet's map would show a preponderance of\r\nearthquakes along the borders of the continents, especially along the\r\n\"Great Circle of Fire\" on the borders of the Pacific Ocean.\r\n\r\nDutton as well as some others assert that the \"Great Circle of Fire\"\r\non the shores of the Pacific has in reality no existence; that,\r\ninstead of there being a continuous region of volcanoes, there is in\r\nreality nothing more than a considerable number of volcanoes arranged\r\nin groups along the borders of this ocean, but separated by spaces\r\ncontaining no marked volcanic activity. We do not think this a tenable\r\nposition, since it is well known that volcanoes lie along great lines\r\nof fissures at different points or openings which are kept open\r\nby subsequent volcanic activity, while the remaining portions are\r\nclosed soon afterwards; and, moreover, in parts of these so-called\r\nnon-volcanic regions, there are probably extended regions of extinct\r\nvolcanoes.\r\n\r\nSince the time of Mallet many maps have been made to show the\r\ndistribution of earthquakes. Among the best of such is that by M. de\r\nMontessus de Ballore.\r\n\r\nSome idea of the great amount of work required for the preparation of\r\nMontessus' map may be formed when one learns that the catalogue of\r\nearthquakes collected by him for this purpose included for the years\r\n1880 to 1900, 131,292 quakes.\r\n\r\nDe Montessus' earthquake map divides the grand divisions of the earth\r\ninto numerous sub-divisions, too numerous, indeed, for even brief\r\ndescription in a work of this kind. From the map he thus laboriously\r\nprepared De Montessus drew the following general conclusions:\r\n\r\n1. The parts of the earth that are most apt to be shaken by\r\nearthquakes are those which possess the greatest differences of relief\r\nbetween their highlands and lowlands, and that in such regions the\r\nmost pronounced earthquakes are found on the steepest slopes.\r\n\r\n2. Earthquakes are most common along those parts of the crust that are\r\nthrown up in huge wrinkles, or mountain ranges, whether these masses\r\nbe above the level of the sea or are covered by it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 55. DAVISON'S EARTHQUAKE MAP OF JAPAN]\r\n\r\n3. Earthquakes are more common in mountainous districts than in\r\nplains. But not all mountains are characterized by earthquakes nor\r\nare all plains free from them. Sometimes the plain at the base of\r\nthe mountain appears to be especially liable to shocks, probably by\r\nreason of slips along faults at these points.\r\n\r\nThe great mountain ranges of the world are generally characterized\r\nby unequal slopes, the long gentle slope facing the interior of the\r\ncontinents, and the short, abrupt slopes being turned towards the\r\ncoast. Now, Montessus points out that volcanoes are the most frequent\r\non the short, abrupt slopes. In some cases, however, where the long\r\nslopes are the roughest, it is these slopes that are most frequently\r\nshaken.\r\n\r\nThe beds of the ocean that lie along rapidly descending lines,\r\nespecially when they lie on the borders of large mountain ranges, are\r\nespecially liable to earthquakes.\r\n\r\nDr. Charles Davison has made a map of the earthquakes of Japan in\r\nwhich he had adopted the plan of representing the origin or centres\r\nof earthquakes by a series of contour lines like those employed on\r\ntopographical maps. The advantage of this type of map over that\r\nemployed by Mallet is just this: Davison's earthquake map of Japan in\r\nwhich the active volcanoes are marked by dots, and the earthquakes\r\nby contour lines surrounding the points of origin, discloses the\r\ninteresting fact that here the positions of the volcanoes and the\r\nearthquake centres coincide, since the mountainous districts where the\r\nactive volcanoes are numerous are singularly free from earthquakes.\r\nThis can be seen from an inspection of Fig. 55.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\nTHE CAUSES OF EARTHQUAKES\r\n\r\n\r\nEarthquakes occurred long before man appeared on earth. It is natural,\r\ntherefore, that our early ancestors, experiencing these unwelcome\r\nphenomena, vaguely endeavored to explain their causes. These early\r\nattempts at explanation have in many cases been of an exceedingly\r\nfanciful character.\r\n\r\nThe ancient Mongolians and Hindoos declared that earthquakes are due\r\nto our earth resting on a huge frog and that they occur whenever the\r\nfrog scratches its head.\r\n\r\nIn Japan, where earthquakes are very common, the ignorant people even\r\nat a much later day declared that there exists in the depth of the sea\r\nan immense fish which, when angry, dashes its head violently against\r\nthe coast of the island, thus making the earth tremble. This is,\r\ndoubtless, the biggest fish-story extant.\r\n\r\nAnother folk-lore explanation in Japan attributes the cause of the\r\ntremblings of the earth to a subterranean monster whose head lies in\r\nthe north of the island of Hondo, while his tail lies between the two\r\nprincipal cities. The shaking of his tail causes earthquakes.\r\n\r\nFantastic and foolish as these explanations are, it is worthy of\r\nnote that the first of the Japanese explanations shows no little\r\nobservation on the part of the people, since it locates the\r\nstarting-points of earthquakes as being not on the land, but on the\r\nbottom of the sea. In point of fact, nearly all the great earthquakes\r\nin Japan seem to start somewhere between the coasts of the islands\r\non the sea-bottom that leads down to a very deep part of the Pacific\r\nknown as the Tuscarora Deep.\r\n\r\nMany years ago nearly everyone believed that earthquakes were caused\r\nsolely by the forces that produce volcanic eruptions; that all\r\nearthquakes, whether in the neighborhood of active volcanoes, or at\r\ngreat distances therefrom, were to be regarded solely as volcanic in\r\ntheir origin.\r\n\r\nIt is now recognized that the most severe and far-reaching earthquakes\r\nhave no immediate connection with volcanic explosions, but are due to\r\nthe sudden slippings of the earth's strata over lines of faults; or,\r\nin other words, earthquakes are most frequently of the tectonic type.\r\n\r\nAt the present time there is unfortunately much difference in\r\nopinion as to the exact cause of earthquakes. By this is not meant\r\nthe immediate cause, but the ultimate cause. As to the immediate\r\ncause, practically all are agreed that quakes of volcanic origin are\r\nto be traced to the same forces that produce volcanic eruptions,\r\nwhile quakes of tectonic origin are due directly to the slipping of\r\nthe strata along the faults. But when inquiry is instituted as to\r\nthe nature of the forces that cause the volcanic eruptions, or that\r\nproduce such an alteration of the strata as permits them afterwards to\r\nslip and thus jar the earth, there is much difference of opinion.\r\n\r\nAs can be seen from a few quotations of well-known authorities, only\r\ntwo kinds of earthquakes exist; namely, volcanic earthquakes and\r\ntectonic earthquakes.\r\n\r\nDana, for example, while acknowledging that small earthquakes may be\r\ncaused by the sudden falling of large rock masses into cavities in the\r\ncrust of the earth, says:\r\n\r\n      \"But true earthquakes come, for the most part at least,\r\n      from one or the other of the following sources of\r\n      disturbance.\r\n\r\n      \"1. Vapors suddenly produced, causing ruptures and friction.\r\n\r\n      \"2. Sudden movements or slips along old or new fractures.\r\n\r\n      \"Earthquakes due to the former of these methods are common\r\n      about volcanoes, and at the Hawaiian islands shakings that\r\n      are destructive over the island of Hawaii at the moment of\r\n      some of the more violent eruptions, do not often affect the\r\n      island of Oahu, a depth of 500 fathoms of water, the least\r\n      depth between the two islands, being sufficient to stop off\r\n      the vibrations....\r\n\r\n      \"Earthquakes of the second mode of origin may occur in all\r\n      regions, volcanic or not. They have their origin mostly in\r\n      the vicinity of mountain regions, where old fractures most\r\n      abound. The vibrations may begin in a slip of a few inches,\r\n      in fact; but where there has been a succession of slips,\r\n      up and up from 10,000 feet or more, as in the Appalachian,\r\n      earthquakes of inconceivable volcanic activity must have\r\n      resulted.\"\r\n\r\nDana points out that volcanoes stand on lines of fractures in the\r\nopenings of which their existence began and that, during geological\r\ntime, slips up or down these fractures have occurred, producing\r\nearthquakes and possibly starting eruptions.\r\n\r\nPrestwich, a well-known English geologist, speaks very decidedly\r\nconcerning the causes of earthquakes:\r\n\r\n      \"For my own part, I am disposed to share the belief\r\n      expressed by Dana that the tension or pressure, by which\r\n      the great oscillations or plications of the earth's crust\r\n      have been produced, have not entirely ceased; and that\r\n      this is generally the most probable cause of earthquakes.\r\n      The uplifting of the great continental tracts and mountain\r\n      ranges must have always left the interior of the crust in\r\n      a state of unstable equilibrium, and any slight slide or\r\n      settling along an old fracture, or in highly disturbed and\r\n      distorted strata, would be attended by an earthquake shock.\r\n\r\n      \"In volcanic areas the removal of the large volumes of\r\n      molten rock from the interior to the surface must produce\r\n      settlements and strains which might also result in some of\r\n      these minor earthquakes to which volcanic districts are\r\n      so subject. Where we have the two conditions combined, as\r\n      they are in the Andes in South America, these earthquake\r\n      phenomena are, as we should expect, developed on the\r\n      grandest and widest scale.\"\r\n\r\nGeikie, the Scotch geologist, says:\r\n\r\n      \"Various conceivable causes may, at different times\r\n      and under different conditions, communicate a shock to\r\n      the subterranean regions. Such as the sudden flashing\r\n      into steam of water in the spherodial state, the sudden\r\n      condensation of steam, the explosion of a volcanic outpour,\r\n      the falling in of the roof of a subterranean cavity, or the\r\n      sudden snap of deep-seated rocks subjected to prolonged and\r\n      intense stress.\"\r\n\r\nSir Charles Lyell, the great English geologist, holds the following\r\nviews concerning the origin of earthquakes. He speaks as follows in\r\nhis \"Principles of Geology\":\r\n\r\n      \"1. The primary cause of the volcanoes and the earthquakes\r\n      are to a great extent the same, and connected with the\r\n      development of heat and chemical action at various depths\r\n      in the interior of the globe.\r\n\r\n      \"2. Volcanic heat has been supposed by many to be the\r\n      result of the high temperature which belonged to the\r\n      whole planet when it was in a state of igneous fusion,\r\n      a temperature which they suppose to have been always\r\n      diminishing and still to continue to diminish by radiation\r\n      into space....\r\n\r\n      \"The powerful agency of steam or aqueous vapor in volcanic\r\n      eruptions leads us to compare its power of propelling lava\r\n      to the surface with that which it exerts in driving up\r\n      water in the pipe of an Icelandic geyser. Various gases\r\n      also, rendered liquid by pressure at great depths, may\r\n      aid in causing volcanic outbursts and in fissuring and\r\n      convulsing the rocks during earthquakes.\"\r\n\r\nMajor Clarence Edward Dutton, U. S. A., an acknowledged authority on\r\nseismology, speaks as follows:\r\n\r\n      \"Thus far, then, we have two causes of earthquakes which\r\n      are apparently well sustained: (1) the downthrows, which\r\n      have often been observed to be accompanied by earthquakes,\r\n      and (2) volcanic action. But neither of them have been\r\n      shown to be connected with more than a comparatively small\r\n      number. Much the greater part of the earthquakes still\r\n      require explanation, and the indications are manifold that\r\n      some of them are produced by some cause yet to be stated.\"\r\n\r\nHe acknowledges, however, this unknown cause may be traceable to\r\nvolcanic agency. To quote him in full:\r\n\r\n      \"It remains now to refer to the possibility that many\r\n      quakes whose origin is unknown, or extremely doubtful, may,\r\n      after all, be volcanic. This must be fully admitted, and,\r\n      indeed, it is in many cases highly probable. Evidences\r\n      that volcanic action has taken place in the depths of the\r\n      earth without visible, permanent results on the surface\r\n      abound in ancient rock exposures. Formations of great\r\n      geological age, once deeply buried and brought to daylight\r\n      by secular denudations, show that lavas have penetrated\r\n      surrounding rock-masses in many astonishing ways. Sometimes\r\n      they have intruded between strata, lifting or floating up\r\n      the overlying beds without any indication of escaping to\r\n      the surface. Sometimes the lava breaks across a series of\r\n      strata and finds its way into the partings between higher\r\n      beds. Or it forces its way into a fissure to form a dike\r\n      which may never reach the surface. In one place a long arm\r\n      or sheet of lava has in a most surprising and inexplicable\r\n      manner thrust itself into the enveloping rock-mass, and in\r\n      the older or metamorphic rocks these offshoots or apophyses\r\n      cross each other in great numbers and form a tangled\r\n      network of intrusive dikes. In other places the intruded\r\n      lava has formed immense lenticular (lense shaped) masses\r\n      (laccolites), which have domed up the overlying strata\r\n      into mountain masses. These intrusions, almost infinitely\r\n      varied in form and condition, are often, in fact usually,\r\n      inexplicable as mechanical problems, but their reality is\r\n      vouched for by the evidence of our senses. What concerns\r\n      us here is the great energy which they suggest and their\r\n      adequacy to generate in the rocks those sudden, elastic\r\n      displacements which are the real initiatory impulses of an\r\n      earthquake. They assure us that a great deal of volcanic\r\n      action has transpired in past ages far under ground, which\r\n      makes no other sign at the surface than those vibrations\r\n      which we call an earthquake.\"\r\n\r\nKoto, the celebrated Japanese student of earthquakes, and a member\r\nof the Earthquake Investigation Committee appointed by the Japanese\r\nGovernment for studying the great Mino-Owaro earthquake, in Japan,\r\n1891, is properly regarded as an authority on earthquakes. Living, as\r\nhe does, in a country where earthquakes and volcanic eruptions are of\r\nalmost daily occurrence, he has had abundant opportunity for studying\r\nthese phenomena, especially in connection with the Seismological\r\nInstitute of Japan. He speaks as follows:\r\n\r\n      \"To make clear once for all my own standpoint, I may say\r\n      plainly that the chain of volcanoes and the system of\r\n      mountains of the non-volcanic earthquake, appear to me\r\n      to have very intimate and fundamental relations with the\r\n      so-called tectonic line.\"\r\n\r\nMallet regards earthquakes that can be directly traceable to volcanic\r\norigin as unsuccessful efforts on the part of nature to establish\r\nvolcanoes. He speaks concerning this matter as follows:\r\n\r\n      \"An earthquake in a non-volcanic region may, in fact, be\r\n      viewed as an uncompleted effort to establish a volcano.\r\n      The forces of explosion and impulse are the same in both;\r\n      they differ only in degree of energy, or in the varying\r\n      sorts and degrees of resistance opposed to them. There is\r\n      more than a mere vaguely admitted connection between them,\r\n      as heretofore commonly acknowledged--one so vague that the\r\n      earthquake has been often stated to be the cause of the\r\n      volcano (Johnson, 'Phy. Atlas,' Geology, page 21), and more\r\n      commonly the volcano the cause of the earthquake, neither\r\n      view being the expression of the truth of nature. They are\r\n      not in the relation to each other of cause and effect, but\r\n      are both unequal manifestations of a common force under\r\n      different conditions.\"\r\n\r\nBefore closing this chapter on the causes of earthquakes it may be\r\nwell to state briefly the explanations that have been suggested by\r\nthose who hold that the earth is solid and cold throughout its entire\r\nmass, except that in the neighborhood of volcanic districts there\r\nare limited areas situated only a comparatively few miles below the\r\nsurface where the rocks are highly heated.\r\n\r\nProfessor Mallet suggested that the source of heat for these local\r\nareas of melted rocks was to be found in the enormous mechanical force\r\nthat is developed by the crushing of the strata in the earth's crust.\r\nThe principal objection to Mallet's theory is to be found in the\r\nfact that, for this heat to be available for the melting of rocks,\r\nit must be produced rapidly, and not spread out over long periods of\r\ntime. Moreover, there would appear to be no other way to account for\r\nthe production of the great force required to effect the crushing of\r\nthe earth's strata save on the assumption of a highly heated interior\r\nstill cooling and contracting.\r\n\r\nIn his \"Aspects of the Earth\" Shaler has suggested an hypothesis\r\nthat may be regarded to a certain extent as explaining how heat,\r\nslowly generated, might be blanketed, or prevented from escaping and\r\nso possibly reaching a temperature sufficiently high to melt the\r\nmaterials in portions of the interior not far below the surface of the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\n      \"We thus see that in the water imprisoned in the deposits\r\n      of the early geological ages and brought to a high\r\n      temperature by the blanketing action of the more recently\r\n      deposited beds, we have a sufficient cause for the great\r\n      generation of steam at high temperatures, and this is the\r\n      sole essential phenomenon of volcanic eruptions. We see\r\n      also by this hypothesis why volcanoes do not occur at\r\n      points remote from the sea, and why they cease to be in\r\n      action soon after the sea leaves their neighborhood....\r\n\r\n      \"The foregoing considerations make it tolerably clear that\r\n      volcanoes are fed from deposits of water contained in\r\n      ancient rocks which have become greatly heated through the\r\n      blanketing effects of the strata which have been laid down\r\n      upon them. The gas which is the only invariable element\r\n      of volcanic eruptions is steam; moreover, it is the steam\r\n      of sea-water, as is proven by analysis of the ejections.\r\n      It breaks its way to the surface only on those parts of\r\n      the earth which are near to where the deposition of strata\r\n      is lifting the temperature of water contained in rocks by\r\n      preventing, in fact, the escape of the earth's heat.\"\r\n\r\nAnother very common theory is that of chemical action, or the heat\r\nproduced by the oxidation of various substances inside the earth,\r\nsuch, for example, as iron pyrites, a compound of iron and sulphur.\r\n\r\nWhen Sir Humphrey Davy discovered metallic sodium and it was found\r\nthat this material, when thrown on water, possessed the power of\r\nliberating intense heat, the discovery was welcomed by geologists\r\nas affording a possible explanation of the cause of volcanoes and\r\nearthquakes.\r\n\r\nIt may be said generally concerning chemical action as the source\r\nof the earth's interior heat, that the chief objection against it\r\nis the fact that such heat is liberated too slowly to result in the\r\nproduction of a very high temperature. This objection does not exist\r\nin the case of such substances as metallic sodium, since here the\r\nheat is rapidly developed and is sufficient in amount to fuse the\r\nsubstances produced. But in the lava produced in such great quantities\r\nas it is in volcanic districts there must be liberated at the same\r\ntime large quantities of gaseous hydrogen. Now, although hydrogen\r\nis, as we have already seen, sometimes given off with the gases that\r\nescape from volcanic craters, yet the quantity which escapes is so\r\nsmall that this theory of volcanic activity has been practically\r\nabandoned.\r\n\r\nQuite recently, however, among the various chemical substances that\r\nare produced under the extremely high temperatures of the electric\r\nfurnace have been found, or formed, a number of curious substances\r\nsuch as _calcium carbide_, _calcium silicide_, _barium silicide_,\r\netc., that possess the property of becoming highly heated on coming in\r\ncontact with water.\r\n\r\nNow it is an interesting fact that the hydrogen and other gases\r\nwhich are given off by the action of water on these substances are\r\nabsorbed in large quantities by the materials themselves, so that the\r\nobjection of the absence of hydrogen and similar gases in the craters\r\nof the volcanoes would not be quite as objectionable as in the case of\r\nsuch substances.\r\n\r\nOf course, it is impossible to say whether such substances as calcium\r\ncarbide, etc., actually exist inside the earth's crust, yet, as\r\nhas been pointed out, the principal condition necessary for their\r\nformation, i. e., a high temperature, existed at times long after\r\nthe earth, assuming the correctness of the nebular hypothesis, was\r\nseparated from the nebulous sun.\r\n\r\nThere still remains to be discussed the most curious of all possible\r\ncauses that have been suggested for the presence of the local heated\r\nareas at comparatively short distances below the earth's crust;\r\nnamely, radio-activity.\r\n\r\nIn 1896, Henri Becquerel, a Frenchman, while investigating the power\r\nof the X-rays, when passing through certain substances, to produce\r\nphosphorescence, or causing the substances to shine in the dark,\r\nmade the extraordinary discovery that some of the salts of uranium\r\npossess the power of emitting a peculiar radiation closely resembling\r\nthe X-rays, that is able to pass through substances opaque to\r\nordinary light as well as to affect photographic plates. But the most\r\nextraordinary part of this discovery was that the salts of uranium\r\napparently possess the power of giving out this radiation continuously\r\nwithout being exposed to the sun's rays.\r\n\r\nThis peculiar property was called _radio-activity_, and was shortly\r\nafterwards found to be present in many other substances besides\r\nuranium, and notably so in two newly discovered elements known as\r\npolonium and radium.\r\n\r\nNow it has been suggested that if there existed somewhere beneath the\r\nearth's crust in these locally heated areas, large quantities of\r\nradio-active substances, these regions would at last become highly\r\nheated, and in this way likely to produce volcanoes and earthquakes.\r\nIt would not, however, seem that this is probably their true cause.\r\n\r\nFrom what has just been said it is clear how exceedingly difficult it\r\nhas become to explain the source of the earth's interior heat when\r\nthe fact of the earth's original highly heated condition is denied.\r\nWe are, therefore, disposed with Russell to believe, as stated in the\r\nfirst part of this volume, that the ultimate cause of both volcanoes\r\nand earthquakes is to be found in the gradual cooling of an originally\r\nhighly heated globe, and that the greater part of the interior is\r\nstill in a highly heated condition, hot enough to be melted but yet\r\nin a solid condition by reason of the great pressure to which it is\r\nsubjected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV\r\n\r\nEARTHQUAKES OF THE GEOLOGICAL PAST--CATACLYSMS\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were numerous volcanoes in the geological past; therefore, since\r\nvolcanic eruptions are generally attended by earthquake shocks, it\r\nfollows that during that remote past the earth has been violently\r\nshaken by earthquakes. Indeed, if we assume, as we believe to be the\r\ncase, that the cause of earthquakes is correctly to be traced to an\r\noriginally heated globe which is gradually cooling, it follows that\r\nthe earth was necessarily subject to great earthquakes almost from the\r\ntime when it began to cool.\r\n\r\nBut to establish as a fact the occurrence of an earthquake at so\r\nremote a time in the earth's history is far more difficult than to\r\ndetect the occurrence of a volcano at that time. While the earthquake\r\nshocks may produce fissures in the earth's crust, and may be\r\naccompanied by great changes of level, yet the great time that has\r\nelapsed between such occurrences and the present would permit the\r\nvarious geological agencies that are at work either to cover these\r\nfissures completely, or completely to remove by erosion, or in other\r\nsimilar ways, the rocks in which they occurred. It is different in\r\nthe case of a volcano; for the volcanic craters are in many cases\r\nstill left standing, and then there are the voluminous sheets of lava\r\nthat have spread over great areas of the earth, as well as numerous\r\nvolcanic cones. Besides, there are thousands of square miles of\r\nsurface that have been covered, often to great depths, by deposits of\r\nvolcanic dust thrown out at one time or another from the craters of\r\nthe then active volcanoes.\r\n\r\nI am sure you will acknowledge that any force capable of causing great\r\ncracks or fissures in the earth's crust, must, while doing this, have\r\nproduced violent shakings of the earth. Great cracks or fissures are\r\nto be found in the rocks of all the geological formations. These are a\r\nrecord of the earthquakes that must have attended these convulsions.\r\nAnd there is plenty of evidence to show that the earth's crust has\r\nbeen torn into these fissures in places deep down below the present\r\nsurface; for, by the action of water, many of these portions have\r\nbeen uncovered so that these great cracks or fissures which have been\r\nafterwards filled with a molten rock that has hardened can be seen in\r\nthe great dikes that still remain.\r\n\r\nBut there are still other evidences of the existence of earthquakes\r\nduring the geological past. There are found in the different strata\r\nof the earth's crust fossil remains of the plants and animals that\r\nlived on the earth long before the creation of man. By a careful study\r\nof these fossils we know positively the kinds of animals and plants\r\nthat lived on the earth, in its waters, or in its atmosphere, when\r\nthese strata were being deposited. It is in this way possible for a\r\ngeologist to trace the life of the earth and its development as it\r\nis written on the great book of which the earth's different strata\r\nform the separate pages. Now, a careful study of the earth's fauna\r\nand flora during the geological past, shows, beyond any question,\r\nthat occasionally great changes have occurred in the earth; for, here\r\nand there, during different times, we find that certain species of\r\nanimals and plants have completely disappeared, to be followed, after\r\ncertain intervals, by entirely different species. It is evident,\r\ntherefore, that changes have occurred that have made it impossible for\r\nthe animals and plants that formerly lived on the earth to exist under\r\nthe changed conditions. These occurrences are known to geologists\r\nas _exterminations_, _catastrophes_, or _cataclysms_. They are also\r\nsometimes called _revolutions_, for they mark a more or less complete\r\nwiping-out of the animals living at the time they occurred.\r\n\r\nIf you will try to think you will readily understand how great a\r\ncatastrophe must be, that would be able to wipe out or completely\r\ndestroy an entire race of animals.\r\n\r\nYou have doubtless read with astonishment the terrible catastrophe\r\nthat accompanied the eruption of Krakatoa, especially at the loss of\r\nlife and property caused by the great waves that were set up in the\r\nocean, but far reaching as these losses were they have nevertheless\r\naffected but a limited portion of the earth. The plain truth is even\r\nmore stupendous, for catastrophes of the geological past appear to\r\nhave been so far-reaching and powerful as to affect the whole surface\r\nof the earth, and to have annihilated entire races of animals and\r\nplants as if they had never existed.\r\n\r\nGeologists are all practically agreed that there are only two ways in\r\nwhich such exterminations of the earth's life could have been caused,\r\nand these are changes in the earth's climate, or the starting of waves\r\nin the sea by great earthquakes. In the sea; for it must be borne\r\nin mind that in the geological past the greater part of the earth's\r\nsurface was covered by water, and the land areas were comparatively\r\nsmall and low, so that waves created by earthquakes might easily have\r\noverwhelmed the entire land surface.\r\n\r\nOf course, it is fair to suppose that in many cases these\r\nexterminations may have been caused by sudden changes of climate, such\r\nas would naturally have resulted from any change in the direction\r\nof hot ocean currents which formerly flowed from the equator to the\r\npoles. The appearance of a fairly large mass of land in the central\r\nparts of the ocean might readily have turned aside the hot ocean\r\ncurrents that formerly swept over the polar regions, thus greatly\r\nlowering the earth's average temperature in these regions.\r\n\r\nBut it seems probable that the principal cause of the destruction of\r\nlife in the geological past was produced by earthquake waves in the\r\nsea, sweeping over the continents. Let us, therefore, examine two of\r\nthe earth's principal geological revolutions or cataclysms; namely,\r\nthat which occurred at the close of an early geological time known as\r\nthe Palaeozoic, and that which occurred at the end of a geological\r\ntime intermediate between the Palaeozoic time or the time of ancient\r\nlife, called the Mesozoic time, and the Cenozoic time, or the time\r\nimmediately preceding the present time. These two revolutions are\r\ncalled by Dana, _the Post-Palaeozoic_, or _Appalachian Revolution_,\r\nand the _Post-Mesozoic Revolution_. Both were characterized by the\r\nmaking of great mountain systems, and were, therefore, especially\r\nliable to repetitions of tremendous earthquakes that must have\r\nproduced enormous waves in the ocean.\r\n\r\n\"Palaeozoic time,\" says Dana, \"closed with the making of one of the\r\ngreat mountain ranges of North America--the Appalachian, besides\r\nranges in other lands, and in producing one of the most universal and\r\nabrupt disappearances of life in geological history. So great an event\r\nis properly styled a revolution.\"\r\n\r\nTowards the close of the Palaeozoic time immense disturbances of\r\nthe earth's crust occurred during the uplifting of the Appalachian\r\nMountain System. One may, perhaps, form some faint idea of the\r\nimmensity of the forces at work, from the fact that there were\r\ngreat faults produced by the uplifting of the lands attended with\r\ndisplacement amounting to 10,000 or 20,000 feet or more; that in parts\r\nof southwestern Virginia there were flexure faults 100 miles in length.\r\n\r\nAs to the probability of the extensive exterminations that have\r\noccurred during these times being produced by earthquake waves, Dana\r\nspeaks thus:\r\n\r\n      \"The causes of the extermination are two.... (1) a colder\r\n      climate.... (2) earthquake waves produced by orogenic\r\n      movements (movements producing mountain ranges). If North\r\n      America from the west of the Carolinas to the Mississippi\r\n      Valley can be shaken in consequence of a little slip along\r\n      a fracture in times of perfect quiet (the allusion here\r\n      to the Charleston earthquake, in 1886), and ruin mark its\r\n      movements, incalculable violence and great surgings of\r\n      the ocean should have occurred and been often repeated\r\n      during the progress of flexures, miles in height and\r\n      space, and slips along newly opened fractures that kept up\r\n      their interrupted progress through thousands of feet of\r\n      displacements....\r\n\r\n      \"Under such circumstances the devastation of the sea-border\r\n      and the low-lying land of the period, the destruction of\r\n      their animals and plants, would have been a sure result.\r\n      The survivors within a long distance of the coastline\r\n      would have been few. The same waves would have swept over\r\n      European land and seas, and there found coadjutors for new\r\n      strife in earthquake waves of European origin. These times\r\n      of catastrophe may have continued in America through half\r\n      of the following Triassic period; for fully two thirds of\r\n      the Triassic period are unrepresented by rocks and fossils\r\n      on the Atlantic border.\"\r\n\r\nComing now to the Post-Mesozoic revolution this period was marked by\r\nthe making of the greatest of the North American mountain systems.\r\n\r\nDana points out that this revolution affected the summit region of the\r\nRocky Mountains over a broad belt probably as long as the western side\r\nof the continent.\r\n\r\nThis great belt of mountain-making extended from the Arctic regions\r\nthrough North America, probably paralleled by like work, of equal\r\nextent, in South America, but on a more eastern line.\r\n\r\n\"The disappearance of species,\" says Dana, \"at the close of Mesozoic\r\ntime was one of the two most noted in all geological history. Probably\r\nnot a tenth part of the animal species of the world disappeared\r\nat the time, and far less of the vegetable life and terrestrial\r\nInvertebrates; yet the change was so comprehensive that no Cretaceous\r\nspecies of Vertebrate is yet known to occur in the rocks of the\r\nAmerican Tertiary, and not even a marine Invertebrate.\"\r\n\r\nIn tracing the causes of these disappearances, Dana points out that,\r\nperhaps, the principal cause was a decrease in the temperature of the\r\nocean, since the destructions were limited in large measure to marine\r\nlife. He regards, however, the other most probable cause as traceable\r\nto earthquake waves; for the making of a great mountain range along\r\nthe entire length of the continent resulted in displacements of\r\nthe rock formations along lines hundreds of miles in length. Such\r\ndisplacements must have been attended by a succession of earthquakes\r\nof unusual violence, causing the destruction by sudden shocks beneath,\r\nand resulting, directly and indirectly, in waves sweeping over the\r\ncontinent. Since at this time the land was still low for the greater\r\npart, the huge waves must have repeatedly swept over the greater part\r\nof the land, leaving only the smaller species of animals and the\r\nvegetation.\r\n\r\nIt is evident, therefore, that during the geological past earthquakes\r\noccurred that were probably vastly greater than any that have occurred\r\non the earth during more recent times.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI\r\n\r\nTHE KIMBERLY DIAMOND FIELDS AND THEIR VOLCANIC ORIGIN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe elementary substance carbon occurs in three forms, i. e.,\r\n_charcoal_, _graphite_, and the _diamond_. The commonest form of\r\ncarbon is to be found in charcoal, as well as in bituminous coal,\r\nanthracite coal, and _lignite_. Graphite, also known as _plumbago_,\r\nor _black lead_, is the substance you have seen so often in the lead\r\nof pencils. The diamond, as every one knows, is the highly prized\r\nprecious stone that sparkles so brightly in the light, and is so hard\r\nthat it is capable of scratching almost any other substance.\r\n\r\nDiamonds are found in various parts of the world. We are now\r\ninterested in them, however, only as they occur in certain parts of\r\nthe world, as in the great Kimberly diamond fields in Southern Africa.\r\n\r\nDr. Max Bauer in his book on precious stones says that the discovery\r\nof diamonds in South Africa was made by a traveller named O'Reilly,\r\nwho, in 1867, saw a child sitting in the house of a Boer named Jacobs,\r\nplaying with a shining stone. Jacob's farm was a short distance south\r\nof the Orange River near Hopetown. This stone proved to be a diamond\r\nweighing some twenty-one and three-tenths carats and was afterwards\r\nsold for $2,500. The incident led to the discovery and consequent\r\ndevelopment of the Kimberly diamond fields.\r\n\r\nWithout going into a description of the different deposits in which\r\ndiamonds are found, it will suffice to say that in the Kimberly\r\ndistrict the diamonds occur distributed through the materials that\r\nfill peculiar funnel-shaped depressions called _pipes_ which extend\r\nvertically downward to unknown depths. The rock that fills a pipe\r\nconsists of an entirely different material from that in which the pipe\r\noccurs. The upper extremity of the pipe is generally slightly elevated\r\nabove the general surface for a few yards. The pipes vary in diameter\r\nfrom twenty to 750 yards, diameters of from 200 to 300 yards being\r\nquiet common.\r\n\r\nIn 1892, the diamond-bearing material found in the pipes of the\r\nKimberly mines had been excavated vertically downwards a distance of\r\n1,261 feet, without any signs of its being exhausted.\r\n\r\nNow, the materials which fill the pipe of the great Kimberly mine are\r\npractically the same in all the mines in the neighborhood. At the\r\nupper part of the pipe the materials show the action of weathering by\r\nexposure to the air. Here the ground is of a yellowish color. Below,\r\nthe materials have a blue color.\r\n\r\nAccording to Bauer the diamond-bearing material that fills the upper\r\npart of the pipe consists of a soft, sandy material of a light yellow\r\ncolor, known to diamond miners as _yellow ground_, or _yellow stuff_.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the Kimberly mine, the yellow ground has a thickness of\r\nabout sixty feet. Below it the material has a blue color and is known\r\nas the _blue ground_. This latter material possesses the character\r\nof a volcanic _tuff_, which is a hardened clay. It is of a green or\r\nbluish green color and has the appearance of dried mud that holds\r\nor binds together numerous irregular, tough, and sometimes rounded\r\nfragments of a green or bluish black serpentine.\r\n\r\nThe diamonds are found near the surface in the yellow ground, as\r\nwell as downwards through the blue ground. It was at one time thought\r\nthat most of the diamonds existed in the yellow ground, and that they\r\nwould soon disappear entirely at short distances below where the blue\r\nground began. Under this belief some of the most valuable claims\r\nchanged hands at prices far below their true value. It was soon found,\r\nhowever, that large and valuable stones existed in the blue ground,\r\nand, indeed, this ground has never been mined to a depth below where\r\nvaluable diamonds appear.\r\n\r\nThe diamonds occur in very small quantities spread through the yellow\r\nand blue grounds. The following statement by Bauer will show this:\r\n\r\n      \"A striking illustration of their sparing occurrence is\r\n      furnished by the fact that in the richest part of the\r\n      richest mine, namely, in the Kimberly mine, they constitute\r\n      only one part in 2,000,000, or 0.00005% of the blue ground.\r\n      In other mines the proportion is still lower, namely, one\r\n      part in 40,000,000, a yield which corresponds to five\r\n      carats per cubic yard of rock.\"\r\n\r\nOf course, you will desire by this time to know the manner in which\r\nthe pipes of the diamond mines of South Africa have become filled with\r\nthe diamond-bearing rocks, and particularly what diamonds have to do\r\nwith a book on volcanoes and earthquakes.\r\n\r\nDr. Emil Cohen, who has made a study of these regions, regards the\r\npipes as volcanic vents or chimneys, and that the materials filling\r\nthe pipes have been brought up from below by volcanic forces. He says:\r\n\r\n      \"I consider that the diamantiferous ground is a product\r\n      of volcanic action, and was probably erupted at a\r\n      comparatively low temperature in the form of an ash\r\n      saturated with water and comparable to the materials\r\n      ejected by a mud volcano. Subsequently new minerals were\r\n      formed in the mass, consequent on alterations induced in\r\n      the upper part by exposure to atmospheric agencies, and in\r\n      the lower by the presence of water. Each of the crater-like\r\n      basins, or, perhaps, more correctly, funnels, in which\r\n      alone diamonds are now found, was at one time the outlet\r\n      of an active volcano which became filled up, partly with\r\n      the products of eruption and partly with ejected material\r\n      which fell back from the sides of the crater intermingled\r\n      with various foreign substances, such as small pebbles,\r\n      or organic remains of local origin, all of which became\r\n      imbedded in the volcanic tuff. The substance of the tuff\r\n      was probably mainly derived from deep-seated crystalline\r\n      rocks, of which isolated remains are now to be found,\r\n      and which are similar to those which now crop out at the\r\n      surface, only at a considerable distance from the diamond\r\n      fields. These crystalline rocks from which the diamonds\r\n      probably took their origin, were pulverized and forced\r\n      up into the pipes by the action of volcanic forces, and\r\n      imbedded in this eruptive material, these diamonds either\r\n      in perfect crystals or in fragments are now found.\"\r\n\r\nSo far as the volcanic origin of the diamonds of the Kimberly diamond\r\nfields is concerned, Cohen's theory has been generally accepted with\r\nthe following modifications: that the pipes were not filled by a\r\nsingle volcanic eruption, but by successive eruptions, and that in\r\nthe case of the Kimberly mine, the pipes contain the results of as\r\nmany as fifteen successive eruptions. There has, however, been another\r\nand more important modification proposed to Cohen's theory, which is\r\nfar more probable. It will be noticed that Cohen's theory regards the\r\naction of the volcanic eruption as only serving to bring fragments\r\nof a deep-seated mother rock that contained the diamonds up from\r\nbelow with the material that fills the pipe. Now, Prof. Carvill Lewis\r\nproposes the following very important change in Cohen's theory: that\r\nthe blue ground does not consist of fragmentary material or tuff, but\r\nwas forced up from below in the pipe in a molten mass and consolidated\r\non cooling. In other words, the blue ground is filled with an ordinary\r\nigneous rock that was solidified in place in the vent or pipe.\r\n\r\nIn the great Kimberly mines the surface of the pipe is divided into\r\nnumerous separate claims, each consisting of a small square lot. There\r\nare so many of these claims in the Kimberly mine that its surface is\r\nhoney-combed by numerous square pits. The work is done largely by\r\nnative Kaffirs employed there since the '70's. As the material was\r\nremoved from the pit, the adjoining claims were separated from each\r\nother by high vertical walls.\r\n\r\nAt a later date, in order to remove the material and separate the\r\nlots, high staging provided with ropes and hauling machinery was\r\nerected. The number of these ropes is now so great that the mine has\r\nthe appearance of a huge cobweb.\r\n\r\nA very extensive series of investigations has been made at a\r\ncomparatively recent date by Prof. Henri Moissan of France on various\r\nchemical products that are obtained under the influence of the high\r\ntemperatures of the electric furnace. When a powerful electric current\r\nis caused to pass through a highly refractory material, that is to\r\nsay, a material difficult to fuse, such as carbon, it raises it to an\r\nextremely high temperature. A still higher temperature can be obtained\r\nby causing a powerful current to flow between two carbon rods that\r\nare first brought into contact, and then gradually separated from\r\neach other, just as they are in the ordinary arc lights employed for\r\nlighting the streets of our cities. In the latter way a temperature\r\nthat is estimated as high as 3,500° C. (6,332° F.), can be readily\r\nobtained. Under these very high temperatures some very curious\r\nchemical products have been obtained in electric furnaces. These\r\nfurnaces consist of small chambers made of highly refractory materials\r\nclosely surrounding the incandescent carbon, or the carbon voltaic\r\narc. Among some of the most curious of these products are artificially\r\nproduced diamonds.\r\n\r\nMoissan, however, was not the first to produce diamonds artificially.\r\nAs soon as Lavoisier had experimentally shown that the chemical\r\ncomposition of the diamond and carbon are the same, efforts were made\r\nto convert charcoal into diamonds, and Despretz, as early as 1849,\r\nby means of the combined influence of a powerful burning glass, the\r\noxyhydrogen blowpipe, and the carbon voltaic arc obtained a very high\r\ntemperature. He claims by this temperature to have been able to change\r\ncarbon into a few microscopic diamonds. It is quite possible, in the\r\nlight of later investigations, that Despretz may have been mistaken\r\nin his belief that he had actually produced diamonds; but whether\r\nthis be so or not, he was certainly one of the pioneers in this early\r\ntransformation of charcoal.\r\n\r\nTheoretically, all that would be required in order to change the\r\nnon-crystalline form of carbon into the diamond, would be to\r\nsubject the carbon to a temperature sufficiently high to fuse it\r\nand then permit it slowly to crystallize. Could this be done, there\r\nshould be no trouble in transforming any amount of coal into any\r\nequal amount of diamonds. But the transformation is by no means as\r\nsimple as might be supposed. It is not that the temperature of the\r\ncarbon cannot be raised to its point of fusion, but that as soon\r\nas a certain temperature has been reached, the carbon, instead of\r\nfusing or melting, is suddenly volatilized or turned into vapor.\r\nThere is no doubt that this is done. Thousands of feet of carbon\r\nrods are volatilized every night in the arc lamps of our cities,\r\nbut the trouble is that this carbon vapor so formed, when cooled,\r\nor condensed, is not converted into the exceedingly hard, clear,\r\ncrystalline diamond, but into the soft, dull black graphite or\r\nplumbago.\r\n\r\nNow the process adopted by Moissan in order to cause volatilized\r\ncarbon, or carbon vapor, to condense in the form of crystalline\r\ndiamonds was practically as follows: he placed pieces of pure carbon\r\ninside a very strong steel tube, such, for example, as would be formed\r\nby boring a short cylindrical hole in a piece of strong thick steel,\r\nand placing a small quantity of carbon inside the tube so formed.\r\nClosing the open end of the tube by means of a tightly fitting screw\r\nplug, he volatilized the carbon inside the tube. The steel, tube, and\r\nplug formed an electric furnace, for, as soon as he passed an electric\r\ncurrent through it, the temperature at once became high enough to\r\nvolatilize the carbon.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances the carbon vapor was subjected to great\r\npressure owing to the limited space in which it was liberated. As soon\r\nas this mass of dense vapor had been formed, he seized the steel tube\r\nwith a pair of furnace tongs, and plunged it below the surface of cold\r\nwater in a bucket.\r\n\r\nOf course, as the hot tube suddenly chilled, there was a great\r\nshrinking in the walls of the furnace, so that the already compressed\r\ncarbon vapor was subjected to a still greater pressure which possibly\r\nliquified it. Of that, however, we cannot speak definitely. This,\r\nhowever, can safely be asserted, that when the tube was broken open\r\na confused mass of small crystals was found inside, some of which,\r\non examination with the microscope, were found to consist of small\r\ncrystals of two forms of diamonds, namely, the black diamond, or\r\ncarbonado, and the regular crystallized diamond.\r\n\r\nMoissan made a great number of experiments for producing diamonds\r\nin this way, and succeeded in forming some very beautiful, though\r\nmicroscopic, diamonds.\r\n\r\nWhat may be said to characterize especially Moissan's experiments was\r\nthe comparatively great number of diamonds, so small as to be scarcely\r\ndistinguishable under the microscope. The high temperature to which\r\nthe materials inside the tube were exposed resulted in the production\r\nof numerous minute crystals of different minerals. In order to get rid\r\nof as many of these as possible Moissan adopted the plan of subjecting\r\nthe material to the action of powerful solvents, such as sulphuric\r\nacid, aqua regia, or a mixture of sulphuric and nitric acid, and\r\nhydrofluoric acid. These acids destroyed most of the minute crystals\r\nof other minerals, but left the minute crystals of diamonds unaffected.\r\n\r\nNow it will be observed that the theory proposed by Prof. Carvill\r\nLewis as to the probable origin of the diamonds of the Kimberly mines\r\nbears a wonderfully close resemblance to the method adopted by Moissan\r\nfor the production of artificial diamonds, since it supposes the\r\ndiamonds to have been formed by the sudden cooling or chilling within\r\nthe pipe of various molten materials brought up from great depths by\r\nthe volcanic forces. If this be true, then besides the comparatively\r\nlarge crystallized and perfect diamonds found in the blue ground\r\nof the Kimberly mines, there should also be found large quantities\r\nof microscopic diamonds, just as are found in Moissan's electric\r\nfurnaces, in which he produced artificial diamonds.\r\n\r\nMoissan, considering this, obtained a specimen of the blue ground\r\nfrom the Kimberly diamond pipe and on subjecting it to the action of\r\nthe different solvents before named, found in the mass that was left\r\nundissolved a great number of microscopic diamonds. It would seem,\r\ntherefore, that there is no reasonable doubt but that the Kimberly\r\ndiamond fields had their diamonds produced by the sudden chilling in\r\nthe volcanic pipes of molten materials brought from great depths by\r\nthe force of volcanic eruption.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII\r\n\r\nTHE FABLED CONTINENT OF ATLANTIS\r\n\r\n\r\nBesides the sudden changes of level that frequently occur during\r\nearthquake shocks there are gradual changes of level that take place\r\nvery slowly throughout long periods of time.\r\n\r\nThese are believed to be due to the warpings produced by the cooling\r\nof an originally highly heated globe.\r\n\r\nIt is not true, therefore, that the earth's surface is fixed, or that\r\nits land and water areas remain always the same. On the contrary, what\r\nis land at one time is water at another time, and so, too, water areas\r\nmay become changed into land areas.\r\n\r\nFor the most part these changes go on so slowly as not to be\r\nnoticeable in an ordinary lifetime. Indeed, in some cases, they are so\r\nextremely gradual that Methuselah himself might have gone to his grave\r\nin ignorance of their progress.\r\n\r\nLet us briefly note a few well-known gradual changes of level.\r\n\r\nOne of the most extensive of these is the sinking of an immense area,\r\nover 6,000 miles in diameter, that covers a large part of the bed or\r\nfloor of the Pacific Ocean.\r\n\r\nIt is an easy matter to observe the gradual changes of level on the\r\ncoasts, since the old water line can be at once found, but it is very\r\ndifficult to detect such changes in the bed of the ocean, hidden as\r\nit is by a covering of water. Yet many things that seem impossible to\r\nthe uninitiated are readily solved by those familiar with physical\r\nscience. Little signs, meaningless to others, are easily read, and\r\nthese prove beyond doubt the gradual sinking of the ocean's bed.\r\n\r\nIt was once believed that the coral polyps or animalculæ from the\r\nhard, bony skeletons of which coral reefs are formed, could live\r\nat the greatest depths of the ocean. These minute animals were,\r\ntherefore, generally credited with filling up the deep ocean,\r\nin certain places, and converting it into dry land, and poetic\r\nphilosophers were pleased to point to their indefatigable labors as an\r\nobject lesson to the slothful.\r\n\r\nBut these charming, though fallacious, ideas were rudely overthrown by\r\nthe sounding line and the drag-net. It had long been known that pieces\r\nof coral rock were brought up by dredging apparatus from the bottom of\r\nthe ocean at all depths, but it was eventually shown that such pieces\r\nof coral rock never contained living animalculæ, when brought from\r\nwater at greater depths than from 100 to 120 feet.\r\n\r\nIt puzzled scientific men no little at first to explain this apparent\r\ninconsistency. If the coral polyp could not live in water at greater\r\ndepths than from 100 to 120 feet, how could the presence of coral rock\r\nat a depth of thousands of feet be explained? Happily, however, this\r\nproblem was solved by the great naturalist, Charles Darwin, who showed\r\nthat coral islands can only be formed in parts of the ocean whose beds\r\nare sinking at the same gradual rate at which the coral rock is being\r\ndeposited. The presence, therefore, of coral islands on the bed of the\r\nPacific, as well as along parts of its coasts, are, to scientific men,\r\nas good indications of its gradual sinking as if such facts had been\r\nwritten in the clearest language.\r\n\r\nBut there are other instances of gradual changes of level besides\r\nthe bed of the Pacific. About 600 miles along the coast of Greenland,\r\nfrom Disco Bay, near lat. 69° N., south to the Firth of Igaliko, lat.\r\n60° 43' N., the bed of the ocean has been slowly sinking through 400\r\nyears. Old buildings and islands have been covered by the waters, so\r\nthat fishermen have been compelled to provide new poles for their\r\nboats. As Sir Charles Lyell remarks:\r\n\r\n      \"In one place the Moravian settlers have been obliged more\r\n      than once to move inland the poles upon which their large\r\n      boats are set, and the old poles still remain beneath the\r\n      water as silent witnesses of the change.\"\r\n\r\nBesides these gradual changes of level there are many others, but\r\nonly one more need be cited: the gradual movements of the coasts of\r\nNorth America between Labrador and New Jersey that are rising in some\r\nplaces, and sinking in other places.\r\n\r\nThe evidences of these gradual changes of level are sometimes of\r\nsuch a character that he who runs may read them. One of the most\r\ninteresting is, perhaps, that of the old Roman temple of Jupiter\r\nSerapis, at Pozzuli, on the borders of the Mediterranean. This temple,\r\nwhen completed, was 124 feet in length and 115 feet in width. Its roof\r\nwas supported by forty-six columns, each forty-two feet in height, and\r\nfive feet in diameter. Only three of these columns are now standing.\r\nThey give, however, unquestionable evidence of having been submerged\r\nfor about half their height. Nor, indeed, is the evidence wanting that\r\nthis submergence continued a considerable time; for, while the lower\r\ntwelve feet of the columns remain smooth and unaffected, yet, for a\r\ndistance of nine feet above this portion, they have been perforated\r\nby various stone-boring mollusks of a species still living in the\r\nMediterranean. This witnesses that the columns, when submerged, were\r\nburied in mud for twelve feet, and surrounded by water nine feet\r\ndeep. According to Dana, the pavement of the temple is still under\r\nwater. The fact that another pavement exists below it shows that these\r\nchanges of level had occurred before the temple was deserted by the\r\nRomans. It appears, that, prior to 1845, a gradual sinking of this\r\npart of the coast had been going on, but that since then there has\r\nensued a gradual rising.\r\n\r\nThe evidences of these gradual changes of level in the land and water\r\nsurfaces of the earth cannot be doubted by even the most skeptical.\r\nAgain and again has the dry land disappeared below the surface of the\r\nwaters of the ocean. Again and again, the ocean's bed has been raised\r\nto the surface and been converted into dry land. Suppose we attempt to\r\nfollow one of the latter movements.\r\n\r\nWe will imagine an extensive area to have slowly appeared above the\r\nocean. In due process of time this land surface, which we will assume\r\nto have continental dimensions, gradually becomes covered with plant\r\nand animal life. If it remains above the water for a sufficient\r\nlength of time, its simple plants and animals acquire more and more\r\ncomplex forms, so as to make it difficult to detect any traces of the\r\noriginal species from which they have descended, or, more correctly,\r\nascended. Moreover, where favorable conditions exist, the continent\r\nbecomes peopled with men, who gradually advance from barbarism to\r\nsemi-barbarism and eventually become a most highly civilized nation,\r\nsending to different parts of the world colonies, who carry with them\r\nthe language and religious customs of the land of their birth.\r\n\r\nBut, a sudden or paroxysmal change of level occurs. The highly\r\ndeveloped and densely populated region is suddenly swept out of\r\nexistence and completely covered by the waters of the ocean until, in\r\na few thousand years, all traces of its existence have so completely\r\ndisappeared that but few, if any, can be found willing to acknowledge\r\nit ever had an existence.\r\n\r\nSuch, it is claimed, was the fate of the fabled Continent of Atlantis.\r\nIt will, therefore, be interesting to endeavor briefly to review its\r\npast history and to read some of the things that have been written\r\nabout this part of the world, which appears in the opinion of some of\r\nthe ancients to have actually existed.\r\n\r\nReferences to Atlantis have been made by various early writers. Solon,\r\nthe great Athenian lawgiver, who flourished 600 years B. C.,\r\nbegan a description of this place in verse. This description was never\r\ncompleted. At a later date one of Solon's descendants, Plato, who\r\nlived about 400 B. C., prepared a description of Atlantis,\r\ngiving in detail its location, the general character of its surface,\r\na description of its principal city, and the civilization of its\r\ninhabitants, as well as a brief reference to its sudden destruction.\r\nIn another place this record of Plato will be given in full. It will\r\nsuffice now to quote briefly what he says concerning its location.\r\n\r\n      \"There was an island situated in front of the straits which\r\n      you call the Columns of Heracles (Straits of Gibraltar).\r\n      The island was larger than Libya and Asia put together,\r\n      and was the way to other islands, and from the island you\r\n      might pass through the whole in the opposite continent,\r\n      for this sea which is within the Straits of Heracles is\r\n      only a harbor, having a narrow entrance, but that other is\r\n      the real sea, and the surrounding land may most truly be\r\n      called a continent. Now, in the island of Atlantis, there\r\n      was a great and wonderful empire, which had ruled over the\r\n      whole island and several others, as well as over part of\r\n      the continents; and, besides these, they subjected the\r\n      parts of Libya within the Columns of Heracles as far as\r\n      Egypt, and of Europe as far as Tyrrhenia. The vast power,\r\n      thus gathered into one, endeavored to subdue at one blow\r\n      our country and yours, and the whole of the land which was\r\n      within the straits, and then, Solon, your country shone\r\n      forth, in the excellence of her virtues and strength, among\r\n      all mankind, for she was the first in courage and military\r\n      skill, and was the leader of the Hellenes. And when the\r\n      rest fell off from her, being compelled to stand alone,\r\n      after having undergone the very extremity of danger, she\r\n      defeated and triumphed over the invaders, and preserved\r\n      from slavery those who were not yet subjected, and freely\r\n      liberated all the others who dwelt within the limits of\r\n      Heracles.\r\n\r\n      \"But afterwards, there occurred violent earthquakes and\r\n      floods, and in a single day and night of rain, all your\r\n      warlike men in a body sunk into the earth, and the island\r\n      of Atlantis in a like manner disappeared, and was sunk\r\n      beneath the sea. And that is the reason why the sea in\r\n      those parts is impassable and impenetrable, because there\r\n      is such a quantity of shallow mud in the way; and this\r\n      was caused by the subsidence of the island.\" (\"Plato's\r\n      Dialogues,\" ii, 517, Timæus).\r\n\r\nBut besides Solon and Plato there are other ancient writers who refer\r\nto the lost island of Atlantis.\r\n\r\nÆlian, in his \"Varia Historia,\" lib. iii, chap. xvii, states that\r\nTheopompos, who flourished 400 B. C., refers to an interview\r\nbetween Midas, King of Phrygia, and Sielus, in which the latter speaks\r\nof a great continent larger than Asia, Europe, and Libya together that\r\nexisted in the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nProclus quotes a statement from an ancient writer, who speaks about\r\nthe islands of the sea beyond the Pillars of Hercules (Straits of\r\nGibraltar).\r\n\r\nMarcellus, in a book on the Ethiopians, refers to seven islands in\r\nthe Atlantic whose inhabitants preserve legends of a greater island\r\n(possibly Atlantis), that had dominion over the small islands.\r\n\r\nDiodorus Siculus asserts that the Phoenicians discovered a large\r\nisland in the Atlantic beyond the Pillars of Hercules several days'\r\nsail from the coast of Africa.\r\n\r\nHomer, Plutarch, and other ancient writers, refer to several islands\r\nin the Atlantic situated several thousand stadia from the Pillars of\r\nHercules. (A stadium was a Greek measure of length equal to 600 feet.\r\nIt was equal to one-eighth of a Roman mile, or 625 Roman feet.)\r\n\r\nIgnatius Donnelly, in his book, called \"Atlantis, the Ante-Diluvian\r\nWorld,\" claims that Plato's description of Atlantis which has\r\ngenerally been regarded as imaginary, was, on the contrary, historic;\r\nthat the prehistoric continent of Atlantis was the cradle of the human\r\nrace; that here man reached his highest civilization; that Atlantis\r\nwas the site of the Garden of Eden, the Gardens of the Hesperides, the\r\nElysian Fields, as well as Olympus; that, under the forms of the gods\r\nand goddesses of the ancient Greeks, the Phoenicians, the Hindoos,\r\nand the Scandinavians, are related the stories of the kings, queens,\r\nand heroes of Atlantis.\r\n\r\nMuch that has been claimed for the lost continent can hardly be\r\nregarded in any other light save that of imagination. For example, it\r\nhas been asserted that it was from Atlantis that the colonies were\r\nsent out that peopled the coast countries of the Gulf of Mexico, of\r\nparts of the valley of the Mississippi, the basin of the Amazon, the\r\nwestern coasts of South America, parts of Europe, the shore lands of\r\nthe Mediterranean Sea, the coasts of Europe, including the Caspian and\r\nthe Black Seas, and even of parts of Africa.\r\n\r\nIt has also been asserted that this mighty nation of Atlantis carried\r\nthe worship of the sun to Egypt, which was one of its first colonies,\r\nand, therefore, the civilization of Egypt was but an offshoot of\r\nprehistoric Atlantis.\r\n\r\nBut it will be reasonably objected that, if such a mass of land ever\r\nexisted in the North Atlantic, some evidences should still be found\r\non the bed of the ocean. Even though great periods of time have\r\nelapsed since the disappearance of Atlantis, some traces of its former\r\nexistence should still remain on the floor of the ocean. Are there\r\nany evidences of an old land mass on this part of the floor of the\r\nAtlantic? The answer is unmistakable.\r\n\r\nDeep-sea soundings show beyond question that there still exists in\r\nthe North Atlantic in the region where Atlantis is said to have been\r\nlocated a submarine island, the summits of which appear above the\r\nwaters in the Azores and the Canary Islands. This submarine island\r\nhas been traced southwest over the bed of the ocean for a distance of\r\nseveral thousand miles with a breadth of fully 1,000 miles. Toward the\r\nsouth there is connected with it another submarine island, the summits\r\nof which reach above the surface in the islands of Ascension, St.\r\nHelena, and Tristan d'Acunha.\r\n\r\nBut the testimony of the submarine islands extends further than this.\r\nAccording to a number of careful soundings it appears that the bed\r\nof these parts of the ocean, instead of being characterized by a\r\ncomparatively level surface due to the gradual accumulation of silt,\r\npossesses, to a great extent, the peculiarly sculptured surfaces which\r\nare only produced by exposure for a long time to the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nOther facts might be adduced to show that some time during the first\r\nappearance of man on the earth there was a large land mass connecting\r\nthe Eastern and Western Continents. These facts include the wonderful\r\nresemblances existing between the plants and animals of the Eastern\r\nand Western Continents, the close resemblances of the myths and\r\nlegends of the races of the Eastern and Western Continents, as well\r\nas the identity of their religious ideas, and the close similarity of\r\ntheir language so far as relates to certain fundamental ideas. These\r\nfacts all point unquestionably to the existence of some large land\r\nmass between the two continents, and to this extent to throw light on\r\nthe probable existence of prehistoric Atlantis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\r\n\r\nPLATO'S ACCOUNT OF ATLANTIS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following is a translation of Plato's record in full:\r\n\r\n      Critias. Then listen, Socrates, to a strange tale, which\r\n      is, however, certainly true, as Solon, who was the wisest\r\n      of the seven sages, declared. He was a relative and great\r\n      friend of my great-grandfather, Dropidas, as he himself\r\n      says in several of his poems, and Dropidas told Critias, my\r\n      grandfather, who remembered, and told us, that there were\r\n      of old great and marvellous actions of the Athenians, which\r\n      have passed into oblivion through time and the destruction\r\n      of the human race--and one in particular, which was the\r\n      greatest of them all, the recital of which will be a\r\n      suitable testimony of our gratitude to you....\r\n\r\n      Socrates. Very good; and what is this ancient famous\r\n      action of which Critias spoke, not as a mere legend, but\r\n      as a veritable action of the Athenian State, which Solon\r\n      recounted?\r\n\r\n      Critias. I will tell an old-world story which I heard from\r\n      an aged man; for Critias was, as he said, at that time\r\n      nearly ninety-years of age, and I was about ten years of\r\n      age. Now the day was that day of the Apaturia which is\r\n      called the registration of youth; at which, according to\r\n      custom, our parents gave prizes for recitations, and the\r\n      poems of several poets were recited by us boys, and many\r\n      of us sung the poems of Solon, which were new at the time.\r\n      One of our tribe, either because this was his real opinion,\r\n      or because he thought that he would please Critias, said\r\n      that, in his judgment, Solon was not only the wisest of men\r\n      but the noblest of poets. The old man, I well remember,\r\n      brightened up at this, and said smiling: \"Yes, Amynander,\r\n      if Solon had only, like other poets, made poetry the\r\n      business of his life, and had completed the tale which he\r\n      brought with him from Egypt, and had not been compelled, by\r\n      reason of the factions and troubles which he found stirring\r\n      in this country when he came home, to attend to other\r\n      matters, in my opinion, he would have been as famous as\r\n      Homer, or Hesiod, or any poet.\"\r\n\r\n      \"And what was that poem about, Critias?\" said the person\r\n      who addressed him.\r\n\r\n      \"About the greatest action which the Athenians ever did,\r\n      and which ought to have been most famous, but which,\r\n      through the lapse of time and the destruction of the\r\n      actors, has not come down to us.\"\r\n\r\n      \"Tell us,\" said the other, \"the whole story, and how and\r\n      from whom Solon heard this veritable tradition.\"\r\n\r\n      He replied: \"At the head of the Egyptian Delta, where the\r\n      river Nile divides, there is a certain district which is\r\n      called the district of Sais, and the great city of the\r\n      district is also called Sais, and is the city from which\r\n      Amasis the king was sprung. And the citizens have a deity\r\n      who is their foundress: she is called in the Egyptian\r\n      tongue Neith, which is asserted by them to be the same\r\n      whom the Hellenes called Athene. Now, the citizens of\r\n      this city are great lovers of the Athenians, and say that\r\n      they are in some way related to them. Thither came Solon,\r\n      who was received by them with great honor; and he asked\r\n      the priests, who were most skilful in such matters, about\r\n      antiquity, and made the discovery that neither he nor any\r\n      other Hellene knew anything worth mentioning about the\r\n      times of old.\r\n\r\n      \"On one occasion, when he was drawing them on to speak of\r\n      antiquity, he began to tell about the most ancient things\r\n      in our part of the world--about Phoroneus, who is called\r\n      'the first,' and about Niobe; and, after the Deluge, to\r\n      tell of the lives of Deucalian and Pyrrha; and he traced\r\n      the genealogy of their descendants, and attempted to\r\n      reckon how many years old were the events of which he was\r\n      speaking, and to give the dates. Thereupon, one of the\r\n      priests, who was of very great age, said: 'O Solon, Solon,\r\n      you Hellenes are but children, and there is never an old\r\n      man who is an Hellene.' Solon, hearing this, said, 'What do\r\n      you mean?' 'I mean to say,' he replied, 'that in mind you\r\n      are all young; there is no old opinion handed down among\r\n      you by ancient traditions, nor any science which is hoary\r\n      with age. And I will tell you the reason of this: there\r\n      have been, and there will be again, many destructions of\r\n      mankind arising out of many causes.\r\n\r\n      \"'There is a story which even you have preserved, that\r\n      once upon a time Phaëthon, the son of Helios, having yoked\r\n      the steeds in his father's chariot, because he was not\r\n      able to drive them in the path of his father, burnt up all\r\n      that was upon the earth, and was himself destroyed by a\r\n      thunder-bolt. Now, this has the form of a myth, but really\r\n      signifies a declination of the bodies moving around the\r\n      earth, and in the heavens, and a great conflagration of\r\n      things upon the earth recurring at long intervals of time:\r\n      when this happens, those who live upon the mountains and in\r\n      dry and lofty places are more liable to destruction than\r\n      those who dwell by rivers or on the sea-shore; and from\r\n      this calamity the Nile, who is our never-failing savior,\r\n      saves and delivers us.\r\n\r\n      \"'When, on the other hand, the gods purge the earth with a\r\n      deluge of water, among you herdsmen and shepherds on the\r\n      mountains are the survivors, whereas those of you who live\r\n      in cities are carried by the rivers into the sea; but in\r\n      this country neither at that time nor at any other does\r\n      the water come up from below, for which reason the things\r\n      preserved here are said to be the oldest. The fact is,\r\n      that wherever the extremity of winter frost or of summer\r\n      sun does not prevent, the human race is always increasing\r\n      at times, and at other times diminishing in numbers. And\r\n      whatever happened either in your country or in ours, or in\r\n      any other regions of which we are informed--if any action\r\n      which is noble or great, or in any other way remarkable has\r\n      taken place, all that has been written down of old, and is\r\n      preserved in our temples; whereas you and other nations are\r\n      just being provided with letters and the other things which\r\n      States require; and then, at the usual period, the stream\r\n      from heaven descends like a pestilence, and leaves only\r\n      those of you who are destitute of letters and education;\r\n      and thus you have to begin all over again as children, and\r\n      know nothing of what happened in ancient times, either\r\n      among us or among yourselves.\r\n\r\n      \"'As for those genealogies of yours which you have\r\n      recounted to us, Solon, they are no better than the tales\r\n      of children; for, in the first place, you remember one\r\n      deluge only, whereas there were many of them, and, in the\r\n      next place, you do not know that there dwelt in your land\r\n      the fairest and noblest race of men which ever lived, of\r\n      whom you and your whole city are but a seed or remnant. And\r\n      this was unknown to you, because for many generations the\r\n      survivors of that destruction died and made no sign. For\r\n      there was a time, Solon, before that great deluge of all,\r\n      when the city which now is Athens, was first in war, and\r\n      was preëminent for the excellence of her laws, and is said\r\n      to have performed the noblest deeds, and to have had the\r\n      fairest constitution of any of which tradition tells, under\r\n      the face of heaven.'\r\n\r\n      \"Solon marvelled at this and earnestly requested the priest\r\n      to inform him exactly and in order about these former\r\n      citizens. 'You are welcome to hear about them, Solon,' said\r\n      the priest, 'both for your own sake and for that of the\r\n      city; and, above all, for the sake of the goddess who is\r\n      the common patron and protector and educator of both our\r\n      cities. She founded your city a thousand years before ours,\r\n      receiving from the Earth and Hephæstus the seed of your\r\n      race, and then she founded ours, the constitution of which\r\n      is set down in our sacred registers as 8,000 years old. As\r\n      touching the citizens of 9,000 years ago, I will briefly\r\n      inform you of their laws and of the noblest of their\r\n      actions; and the exact particulars of the whole we will\r\n      hereafter go through at our leisure in the sacred registers\r\n      themselves. If you compare these very laws with your own,\r\n      you will find that many of ours are the counterpart of\r\n      yours, as they were in the olden time.\r\n\r\n      \"'In the first place, there is the caste of priests,\r\n      which is separated from all the others; next there are\r\n      the artificers, who exercise their several crafts by\r\n      themselves, and without admixture of any other, and also\r\n      there is the class of shepherds and that of hunters, as\r\n      well as that of husbandmen; and you will observe, too, that\r\n      the warriors in Egypt are separated from all the other\r\n      classes, and are commanded by the law only to engage in\r\n      war. Moreover, the weapons with which they are equipped\r\n      are shields and spears, and this the goddess taught first\r\n      among you, and then in Asiatic countries, and we among the\r\n      Asiatics first adopted.\r\n\r\n      \"'Then, as to wisdom, do you observe, what care the law\r\n      took from the very first, searching out and comprehending\r\n      the whole order of things down to prophecy and medicine\r\n      (the latter with a view to health); and out of these divine\r\n      elements drawing what was needful for human life, and\r\n      adding every sort of knowledge which was connected with\r\n      them. All this order and arrangement the goddess first\r\n      imparted to you when establishing your city; and she chose\r\n      the spot of earth in which you were born, because she saw\r\n      that the happy temperament of the seasons in that land\r\n      would produce the wisest of men.\r\n\r\n      \"'Wherefore the goddess, who was a lover both of war and\r\n      of wisdom, selected, and first of all settled that spot\r\n      which was the most likely to produce men likest herself.\r\n      And there you dwelt, having such laws as these and still\r\n      better ones, and excelled all mankind in all virtue,\r\n      as became the children and disciples of the gods. Many\r\n      great and wonderful deeds are recorded of your State in\r\n      our histories; but one of them exceeds all the rest in\r\n      greatness and valor; for these histories tell of a mighty\r\n      power which was agressing wantonly against the whole of\r\n      Europe and Asia, and to which your city put an end.\r\n\r\n      \"'This power came forth out of the Atlantic Ocean, for in\r\n      those days the Atlantic was navigable; and there was an\r\n      island situated in front of the straits which you call the\r\n      Columns of Heracles: the island was larger than Libya and\r\n      Asia put together, and was the way to other islands, and\r\n      from the island you might pass through the whole of the\r\n      opposite continent which surrounded the true ocean; for\r\n      this sea which is within the Straits of Heracles is only\r\n      a harbor, having a narrow entrance, but that other is a\r\n      real sea, and the surrounding land may be most truly called\r\n      a continent. Now, in the island of Atlantis there was a\r\n      great and wonderful empire, which had rule over the whole\r\n      island and several others, as well as over parts of the\r\n      continent; and, besides these, they subjected the parts of\r\n      Libya within the Columns of Heracles as far as Egypt, and\r\n      of Europe as far as Tyrrhenia.\r\n\r\n      \"'That vast power, thus gathered into one, endeavored to\r\n      subdue at one blow our country and yours, and the whole of\r\n      the land which was within the straits; and then, Solon,\r\n      your country shone forth, in the excellence of her virtue\r\n      and strength, among all mankind, for she was the first\r\n      in courage and military skill, and was the leader of the\r\n      Hellenes. And when the rest fell off from her, being\r\n      compelled to stand alone, after having undergone the very\r\n      extremity of danger, she defeated and triumphed over the\r\n      invaders, and preserved from slavery those who were not\r\n      yet subjected, and freely liberated all the others who\r\n      dwelt within the limits of Heracles. But afterward there\r\n      occurred violent earthquakes and floods, and in a single\r\n      day and night of rain all your warlike men in a body sunk\r\n      into the earth, and the island of Atlantis in like manner\r\n      disappeared, and was sunk beneath the sea. And that is\r\n      the reason why the sea in those parts is impassable and\r\n      impenetrable, because there is such a quantity of shallow\r\n      mud in the way; and this was caused by the subsidence of\r\n      the island.' ('Plato's Dialogues,' ii, 517, Timæus.)...\r\n\r\n      \"But in addition to the gods whom you have mentioned, I\r\n      would specially invoke Mnemosyne; for all the important\r\n      part of what I have to tell is dependent on her favor, and\r\n      if I can recollect and recite enough of what was said by\r\n      the priests, and brought hither by Solon, I doubt not that\r\n      I shall satisfy the requirements of this theatre. To that\r\n      task, then, I will at once address myself.\r\n\r\n      \"Let me begin by observing first of all that nine thousand\r\n      was the sum of years which had elapsed since the war which\r\n      was said to have taken place between all those who dwelt\r\n      outside the Pillars of Heracles and those who dwelt within\r\n      them. This war I am now to describe. Of the combatants on\r\n      the one side the city of Athens was reported to have been\r\n      the ruler, and to have directed the contest; the combatants\r\n      on the other side were led by the kings of the islands\r\n      of Atlantis, which, as I was saying, once had an extent\r\n      greater than that of Libya and Asia; and, when afterwards\r\n      sunk by an earthquake, became an impassable barrier of mud\r\n      to voyagers sailing from hence to the ocean. The progress\r\n      of the history will unfold the various tribes of barbarians\r\n      and Hellenes which then existed, as they successively\r\n      appear on the scene; but I must begin by describing, first\r\n      of all, the Athenians as they were in that day, and their\r\n      enemies who fought with them; and I shall have to tell of\r\n      the power and form of government of both of them. Let us\r\n      give the precedence to Athens....\r\n\r\n      \"Many great deluges have taken place during the nine\r\n      thousand years, for that is the number of years which have\r\n      elapsed since the time of which I am speaking; and in all\r\n      the ages and changes of things there has never been any\r\n      settlement of the earth flowing down from the mountains, as\r\n      in other places, which is worth speaking of; it has always\r\n      been carried round in a circle, and disappeared in the\r\n      depths below. The consequence is that, in comparison with\r\n      what then was, there are remaining in small islets only the\r\n      bones of the wasted body, as they may be called, all the\r\n      richer and softer parts of the soil having fallen away, and\r\n      the mere skeleton of the country being left....\r\n\r\n      \"And next, if I have not forgotten what I heard when I was\r\n      a child, I will impart to you the character and origin\r\n      of their adversaries; for friends should not keep their\r\n      stories to themselves, but have them in common. Yet, before\r\n      proceeding further in the narrative, I ought to warn you\r\n      that you must not be surprised, if you should hear Hellenic\r\n      names given to foreigners. I will tell you the reason\r\n      of this: Solon, who was intending to use the tale for\r\n      his poem, made an investigation into the meaning of the\r\n      names, and found that the early Egyptians, in writing them\r\n      down, had translated them into their own language, and he\r\n      recovered the meaning of the several names and retranslated\r\n      them, and copied them out again in our language. My\r\n      great-grandfather, Dropidas, had the original writing,\r\n      which is still in my possession, and was carefully studied\r\n      by me when I was a child. Therefore, if you hear names such\r\n      as are used in this country, you must not be surprised, for\r\n      I have told you the reason of them.\r\n\r\n      \"The tale, which was of great length, began as follows:\r\n      I have before remarked, in speaking of the allotments\r\n      of the gods, that they distributed the whole earth into\r\n      portions differing in extent, and made themselves temples\r\n      and sacrifices. And Poseidon, receiving for his lot the\r\n      island of Atlantis, begat children by a mortal woman, and\r\n      settled them in a part of the island which I will proceed\r\n      to describe. On the side toward the sea, and in the centre\r\n      of the whole island, there was a plain which is said to\r\n      have been the fairest of all plains, and very fertile.\r\n      Near the plain, and also in the centre of the island, at a\r\n      distance of about fifty stadia, there was a mountain, not\r\n      very high on any side. In this mountain there dwelt one of\r\n      the earth-born primeval men of that country, whose name was\r\n      Evenor, and he had a wife named Leucippe, and they had an\r\n      only daughter, who was named Cleito.\r\n\r\n      \"The maiden was growing up to womanhood when her father\r\n      and mother died; Poseidon fell in love with her, and had\r\n      intercourse with her; and, breaking the ground, enclosed\r\n      the hill in which she lived all around, making alternate\r\n      zones of sea and land, larger and smaller, encircling\r\n      one another; there were two of land and three of water,\r\n      which he turned as with a lathe out of the centre of the\r\n      island, equidistant every way, so that no man could get\r\n      to the island, for ships and voyagers were not yet heard\r\n      of. He himself, as he was a god, found no difficulty in\r\n      making special arrangements for the centre island, bringing\r\n      two streams of water under the earth, which he caused to\r\n      ascend as springs, one of warm water and the other of cold,\r\n      and making every variety of food to spring up abundantly\r\n      in the earth. He also begat and brought up five pairs of\r\n      male children, dividing the island of Atlantis into ten\r\n      portions; he gave to the first-born of the eldest pair his\r\n      mother's dwelling and the surrounding allotment, which was\r\n      the largest and best, and made him king over the rest; the\r\n      others he made princes, and gave them rule over many men\r\n      and a large territory.\r\n\r\n      \"He named them all: the eldest, who was king, he named\r\n      Atlas, and from him the whole island and the ocean received\r\n      the name of Atlantic. To his twin brother, who was born\r\n      after him, and obtained as his lot the extremity of the\r\n      island toward the Pillars of Heracles, as far as the\r\n      country which is still called the region of Gades in that\r\n      part of the world, he gave the name which in the Hellenic\r\n      language is Eumelus, in the language of the country which\r\n      is named after him, Gadeirus. Of the second pair of twins,\r\n      he called one Ampheres and the other Evæmon. To the third\r\n      pair of twins he gave the name Mneseus to the elder, and\r\n      Autochthon to the one who followed him. Of the fourth pair\r\n      of twins he called the elder Elasippus and the younger\r\n      Mestor. And of the fifth pair he gave to the elder the name\r\n      of Azaes, and to the younger Diaprepes.\r\n\r\n      \"All these and their descendants were the inhabitants\r\n      and rulers of divers islands in the open sea; and also,\r\n      as has been already said, they held sway in the other\r\n      direction over the country within the Pillars as far as\r\n      Egypt and Tyrrhenia. Now Atlas had a numerous and honorable\r\n      family, and his eldest branch always retained the kingdom,\r\n      which the eldest son handed on to his eldest for many\r\n      generations; and they had such an amount of wealth as\r\n      was never before possessed by kings and potentates, and\r\n      is not likely ever to be again, and they were furnished\r\n      with everything which they could desire both in city and\r\n      country. For, because of the greatness of their empire,\r\n      many things were brought to them from foreign countries,\r\n      and the island itself provided much of what was required by\r\n      them for the uses of life.\r\n\r\n      \"In the first place, they dug out of the earth whatever\r\n      was to be found there, mineral as well as metal, and that\r\n      which is now only a name, and was then something more\r\n      than a name--orichalcum--was dug out of the earth in many\r\n      parts of the island, and, with the exception of gold, was\r\n      esteemed the most precious of metals among the men of those\r\n      days. There was an abundance of wood for carpenters' work,\r\n      and sufficient maintenance for tame and wild animals.\r\n      Moreover, there were a great number of elephants in the\r\n      island, and there was provision for animals of every kind,\r\n      both for those who live in lakes and marshes and rivers,\r\n      and also for those which live in mountains, and on plains,\r\n      and therefore for the animal which is the largest and most\r\n      voracious of them.\r\n\r\n      \"Also whatever fragrant things there are in the earth,\r\n      whether roots, or herbage, or woods, or distilling drops\r\n      of flowers, or fruits, grew and thrived in that land; and\r\n      again, the cultivated fruit of the earth, both the dry\r\n      edible fruit and other species of food, which we call by\r\n      the general name of legumes, and the fruits having a hard\r\n      rind, affording drinks, and meats, and ointments, and good\r\n      store of chestnuts and the like, which may be used to play\r\n      with, and are fruits which spoil with keeping--and the\r\n      pleasant kinds of dessert which console us after dinner,\r\n      when we are full and tired of eating--all these that\r\n      sacred island lying beneath the sun brought forth fair and\r\n      wondrous in infinite abundance.\r\n\r\n      \"All these things they received from the earth, and they\r\n      employed themselves in constructing their temples, and\r\n      palaces, and harbors and docks; and they arranged the\r\n      whole country in the following manner: first of all they\r\n      bridged over the zones of sea which surrounded the ancient\r\n      metropolis, and made a passage into and out of the royal\r\n      palace; and then they began to build the palace in the\r\n      habitation of the god and of their ancestors. This they\r\n      continued to ornament in successive generations, every king\r\n      surpassing the one who came before him to the utmost of his\r\n      power, until they made the building a marvel to behold for\r\n      size and for beauty.\r\n\r\n      \"And, beginning from the sea, they dug a canal three\r\n      hundred feet in width and one hundred feet in depth, and\r\n      fifty stadia in length, which they carried through to the\r\n      outermost zone, making a passage from the sea up to this,\r\n      which became a harbor, and leaving an opening sufficient\r\n      to enable the largest vessels to find ingress. Moreover,\r\n      they divided the zones of land which parted the zones\r\n      of sea, constructing bridges of such a width as would\r\n      leave a passage for a single trireme to pass out of one\r\n      into another, and roofed them over; and there was a way\r\n      underneath for the ships, for the banks of the zones were\r\n      raised considerably above the water.\r\n\r\n      \"Now the largest of the zones into which a passage was cut\r\n      from the sea was three stadia in breadth, and the zone of\r\n      land which came next of equal breadth; but the next two,\r\n      as well a zone of water as of land, were two stadia, and\r\n      the one which surrounded the central island was a stadium\r\n      only in width. The island in which the palace was situated\r\n      had a diameter of five stadia. This, and the zones and the\r\n      bridge, which was the sixth part of a stadium in width,\r\n      they surrounded by a stone wall, on either side placing\r\n      towers, and gates on the bridges where the sea passed\r\n      in. The stone which was used in the work they quarried\r\n      from underneath the centre island and from underneath the\r\n      zones, on the outer as well as the inner side. One kind of\r\n      stone was white, another black, and a third red; as they\r\n      quarried, they at the same time hollowed out decks, double\r\n      within, having roofs formed out of the native rock.\r\n\r\n      \"Some of their buildings were simple, but in others they\r\n      put together different stones, which they intermingled for\r\n      the sake of ornament, to be a natural source of delight.\r\n      The entire circuit of the wall which went around the\r\n      outermost one they covered with a coating of brass, and\r\n      the circuit of the next wall they coated with tin, and the\r\n      third, which encompassed the citadel, flashed with the red\r\n      light of orichalcum. The palace in the interior of the\r\n      citadel was constructed in this wise: in the centre was\r\n      a holy temple, dedicated to Cleito and Poseidon, which\r\n      remained inaccessible, and was surrounded by an enclosure\r\n      of gold; this was the spot in which was originally begotten\r\n      the race of ten princes, and thither they annually brought\r\n      the fruits of the earth in their season from all the ten\r\n      portions, and performed sacrifices to each of them.\r\n\r\n      \"Here, too, was Poseidon's own temple, of a stadium in\r\n      length and half a stadium in width, and of a proportionate\r\n      height, having a sort of barbaric splendor. All the outside\r\n      of the temple, with the exception of the pinnacles, they\r\n      covered with silver, and the pinnacles with gold. In the\r\n      interior of the temple the roof was of ivory, adorned\r\n      everywhere with gold and silver and orichalcum; all the\r\n      other parts of the walls and pillars and floor they lined\r\n      with orichalcum. In the temple they placed statues of\r\n      gold: there was the god himself standing in a chariot--the\r\n      charioteer of six winged horses--and of such a size that\r\n      he touched the roof of the building with his head; around\r\n      him were a hundred Nereids riding on dolphins, for such was\r\n      thought to be the number of them in that day.\r\n\r\n      \"There were also in the interior of the temple other images\r\n      which had been dedicated by private individuals. And around\r\n      the temple, on the outside, were placed statues of gold\r\n      of all the ten kings and of their wives; and there were\r\n      many other great offerings, both of kings and of private\r\n      individuals, coming both from the city itself and the\r\n      foreign cities over which they held sway. There was an\r\n      altar, too, which in size and workmanship corresponded to\r\n      the rest of the work, and there were palaces in like manner\r\n      which answered to the greatness of the kingdom and the\r\n      glory of the temple.\r\n\r\n      \"In the next place, they used fountains both of gold and\r\n      hot springs. These were very abundant, and both kinds\r\n      wonderfully adapted to use by reason of the sweetness and\r\n      excellence of their waters. They constructed buildings\r\n      about them, and planted suitable trees; also cisterns,\r\n      some open to the heaven, others which they roofed over,\r\n      to be used in winter as warm baths: there were the king's\r\n      baths, and the baths of private persons, which were kept\r\n      apart; also separate baths for women, and others again for\r\n      horses and cattle, and to them they gave as much adornment\r\n      as was suitable for them. The water which ran off they\r\n      carried, some to the grove of Poseidon, where were growing\r\n      all manner of trees of wonderful height and beauty, owing\r\n      to the excellence of the soil; the remainder was conveyed\r\n      by aqueducts which passed over the bridges to the outer\r\n      circles: and there were many temples built and dedicated\r\n      to many gods; also gardens and places of exercise, some\r\n      for men, and some set apart for horses, in both of the\r\n      two islands formed by the zones; and in the centre of the\r\n      larger of the two, there was a racecourse of a stadium\r\n      in width, and in length allowed to extend all round the\r\n      island, for horses to race in.\r\n\r\n      \"Also there were guard-houses at intervals for the\r\n      body-guard, the more trusted of whom had their duties\r\n      appointed to them in the lesser zone, which was nearer the\r\n      Acropolis; while the most trusted of all had houses given\r\n      them within the citadel, and about the persons of the\r\n      kings. The docks were full of triremes and naval stores,\r\n      and all things were quite ready for use. Enough of the plan\r\n      of the royal palace. Crossing the outer harbors, which were\r\n      three in number, you would come to a wall which began at\r\n      the sea and went all round; this was everywhere distant\r\n      fifty stadia from the largest zone and harbor, and enclosed\r\n      the whole, meeting at the mouth of the channel toward the\r\n      sea.\r\n\r\n      \"The entire area was densely crowded with habitations;\r\n      and the canal and the largest of the harbors were full\r\n      of vessels, and merchants coming from all parts, who,\r\n      from their numbers, kept up a multitudinous sound of\r\n      human voices and din of all sorts, night and day. I have\r\n      repeated his descriptions of the city and the parts about\r\n      the ancient palace nearly as he gave them, and now I must\r\n      endeavor to describe the nature and arrangement of the\r\n      rest of the country. The whole country was described as\r\n      being very lofty and precipitous on the side of the sea,\r\n      but the country immediately about and surrounding the city\r\n      was a level plain, itself surrounded by mountains which\r\n      descended toward the sea; it was smooth and even, but of\r\n      an oblong shape, extending in one direction three thousand\r\n      stadia, and going up the country from the sea through the\r\n      centre of the island two thousand stadia; the whole region\r\n      of the island lies toward the south, and is sheltered from\r\n      the north.\r\n\r\n      \"The surrounding mountains were celebrated for their number\r\n      and size and beauty, in which they exceeded all that are\r\n      now to be seen anywhere; having in them also many wealthy\r\n      inhabited villages, and rivers and lakes, and meadows\r\n      supplying food enough for every animal, wild or tame, and\r\n      wood of various sorts, abundant for every kind of work.\r\n      I will now describe the plain, which had been cultivated\r\n      during many ages by many generations of kings. It was\r\n      rectangular, and for the most part straight and oblong; and\r\n      what it wanted of the straight line followed the line of\r\n      the circular ditch. The depth and width and length of this\r\n      ditch were incredible, and gave the impression that such a\r\n      work, in addition to so many other works, could hardly have\r\n      been wrought by the hand of man. But I must say what I have\r\n      heard.\r\n\r\n      \"It was excavated to the depth of a hundred feet, and its\r\n      breadth was a stadium everywhere; it was carried round the\r\n      whole of the plain, and was ten thousand stadia in length.\r\n      It received the streams which came down the mountains,\r\n      and winding round the plain, and touching the city at\r\n      various points, was there let off into the sea. From above,\r\n      likewise, straight canals of a hundred feet in width were\r\n      cut in the plain, and again let off into the ditch, toward\r\n      the sea. These canals were at intervals of a hundred\r\n      stadia, and by them they brought down the wood from the\r\n      mountains to the city, and conveyed the fruits of the earth\r\n      in ships, cutting transverse passages from one canal into\r\n      another, and to the city. Twice in the year they gathered\r\n      the fruits of the earth--in winter having the benefit of\r\n      the rains, and in summer introducing the water of the\r\n      canals. As to the population, each of the lots in the plain\r\n      had an appointed chief of men who were fit for military\r\n      service, and the size of the lot was to be a square of ten\r\n      stadia each way, and the total number of all the lots was\r\n      sixty thousand.\r\n\r\n      \"And of the inhabitants, of the mountains and of the rest\r\n      of the country there was also a vast multitude having\r\n      leaders, to whom they were assigned according to their\r\n      dwellings and villages. The leader was required to furnish\r\n      for the wars the sixth portion of a war-chariot, so as\r\n      to make up a total of ten thousand chariots; also two\r\n      horses and riders upon them, and a light chariot without\r\n      a seat, accompanied by a fighting man on foot carrying a\r\n      small shield, and having a charioteer mounted to guide the\r\n      horses; also, he was bound to furnish two heavy-armed men,\r\n      two archers, two slingers, three stone-shooters, and three\r\n      javelin men, who were skirmishers, and four sailors, to\r\n      make up a complement of twelve hundred ships. Such was the\r\n      order of war in the royal city.\r\n\r\n      \"That of the other nine governments was different in each\r\n      of them, and would be wearisome to narrate. As to offices\r\n      and honors the following was the arrangement from the\r\n      first: each of the ten kings, in his own division and in\r\n      his own city, had the absolute control of the citizens,\r\n      and in many cases, of the laws, punishing and slaying\r\n      whomsoever he would.\r\n\r\n      \"Now the relations of their governments to one another\r\n      were regulated by the injunctions of Poseidon as the law\r\n      had handed them down. These were inscribed by the first\r\n      men on a column of orichalcum, which was situated in the\r\n      middle of the island, at the temple of Poseidon, whither\r\n      the people were gathered together every fifth and sixth\r\n      years alternately, thus giving equal honor to the odd and\r\n      to the even number. And when they were gathered together\r\n      they consulted about public affairs, and inquired if any\r\n      one had transgressed in anything, and passed judgment on\r\n      him accordingly--and before they passed judgment they gave\r\n      their pledges to one another in this wise:\r\n\r\n      \"There were bulls who had the range of the temple of\r\n      Poseidon; and the ten who were left alone in the temple,\r\n      after they had offered prayers to the gods that they might\r\n      take the sacrifices which were acceptable to them, hunted\r\n      the bulls without weapons, but with staves and nooses; and\r\n      the bull which they caught they led up to the column. The\r\n      victim was then struck on the head by them, and slain over\r\n      the sacred inscription. Now on the column, besides the law,\r\n      there was inscribed an oath invoking mighty curses on the\r\n      disobedient. When, therefore, after offering sacrifices\r\n      according to their customs, they had burnt the limbs of the\r\n      bull, they mingled a cup and cast in a clot of blood for\r\n      each of them. The rest of the victim they took to the fire,\r\n      after having made a purification of the column all round.\r\n\r\n      \"They then drew from the cup in golden vessels, and,\r\n      pouring a libation on the fire, they swore that they would\r\n      judge according to the laws on the column, and would punish\r\n      any one who had previously transgressed, and that for the\r\n      future they would not, if they could help, transgress any\r\n      of the inscriptions, and would not command, or obey any\r\n      ruler who commanded them, to act otherwise than according\r\n      to the laws of their father Poseidon.\r\n\r\n      \"This was the prayer which each of them offered up for\r\n      himself and for his family, at the same time drinking, and\r\n      dedicating the vessel in the temple of the god; and, after\r\n      spending some necessary time at supper, when darkness came\r\n      on and the fire about the sacrifice was cool, all of them\r\n      put on most beautiful azure robes, and, sitting on the\r\n      ground at night near the embers of the sacrifices on which\r\n      they had sworn, and extinguishing all the fires about the\r\n      temple, they received and gave judgment, if any of them had\r\n      any accusation to bring against any one; and, when they had\r\n      given judgment, at daybreak they wrote down their sentences\r\n      on a golden tablet, and deposited them as memorials with\r\n      their robes.\r\n\r\n      \"There were many special laws which the several kings had\r\n      inscribed about the temple, but the most important was the\r\n      following: that they were not to take up arms against one\r\n      another, and they were all to come to the rescue, if any\r\n      one in any city attempted to overthrow the royal house.\r\n      Like their ancestors, they were to deliberate in common\r\n      about war and other matters, giving the supremacy to the\r\n      family of Atlas; and the king was not to have the power of\r\n      life or death over any of his kinsmen, unless he had the\r\n      assent of the majority of the ten kings.\r\n\r\n      \"Such was the vast power which the god settled in the lost\r\n      island of Atlantis; and this he afterward directed against\r\n      our land on the following pretext, as traditions tell. For\r\n      many generations, as long as the divine nature lasted in\r\n      them, they were obedient to the laws, and well-affectioned\r\n      toward the gods, who were their kinsmen, for they possessed\r\n      true and in every way great spirits, practicing gentleness\r\n      and wisdom in the various chances of life, and in their\r\n      intercourse with one another.\r\n\r\n      \"They despised everything but virtue, not caring for\r\n      their present state of life, and thinking lightly on the\r\n      possession of gold, and other property, which seemed only a\r\n      burden to them; neither were they intoxicated by luxury,\r\n      nor did wealth deprive them of their self-control; but\r\n      they were sober, and saw clearly that all these goods are\r\n      increased by virtuous friendship with one another, and that\r\n      by excessive zeal for them and honor of them, the good of\r\n      them is lost, and friendship perishes with them.\r\n\r\n      \"By such reflections, and by the continuance in them of a\r\n      divine nature, all that which we have described waxed and\r\n      increased in them; but when this divine portion began to\r\n      fade away in them, and became diluted too often, and with\r\n      too much of the mortal admixture, and the human nature\r\n      got the upper hand, then, they being unable to bear their\r\n      fortune, became unseemly, and to him who had an eye to see,\r\n      they began to appear base, and had lost the fairest of\r\n      their precious gifts; but to those who had no eye to see\r\n      the true happiness they still appeared glorious and blessed\r\n      at the very time when they were filled with unrighteous\r\n      avarice and power. Zeus, the god of gods, who rules with\r\n      law, and is able to see into such things, perceiving that\r\n      an honorable race was in a most wretched state, and wanting\r\n      to inflict punishment on them, that they might be chastened\r\n      and improved, collected all the gods into his most holy\r\n      habitation, which, being placed in the centre of the world,\r\n      sees all things that partake of generations. And when he\r\n      had called them together, he spake as follows:\"\r\n\r\nThe story abruptly ends here, for Plato left no further record.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX\r\n\r\nNATURE'S WARNING OF COMING EARTHQUAKES\r\n\r\n\r\nThat there are signs of coming earthquakes which might be read by\r\nman, had he sufficient knowledge, there would seem to be but little\r\ndoubt. These phenomena follow natural laws so that the approach of an\r\nearthquake must necessarily be in a definite order both as regards\r\nthe phenomena which precede as well as those which follow it. There\r\nshould, therefore, be signs that would enable one to predict its\r\ncoming, although it must be acknowledged that these signs, so far as\r\nwe actually know, are indistinct.\r\n\r\nIt may seem to the unthinking and unobservant that the awful\r\ncatastrophe of an earthquake comes entirely unheralded; that,\r\napparently, it is not until the earth's surface begins to rock to\r\nand fro under the mighty forces that are causing destruction that\r\nits presence can be known. There are, however, many reasons for\r\nbelieving that in, perhaps, the greatest number of cases, it might\r\nhave been foreseen, if greater attention had been given to the\r\nslight indications of its probable approach a short time before its\r\noccurrence.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the conditions of great pressure or stress in the\r\nearth's crust which finally result in a disastrous earthquake have\r\nbeen slowly accumulating for a long time, and that when the pressure\r\nat last reaches a point where the crust has to yield or slip, the\r\nground is suddenly crushed and tossed to and fro while vast fissures\r\nand chasms are produced in the subterranean regions. At those points\r\nof the earth immediately above or in the neighborhood of such regions\r\nit is possible that there are many signs of the coming quake;\r\nand, although indistinguishable by our duller senses, are readily\r\nappreciated by the more highly developed senses of the lower animals.\r\nIndeed, had we accustomed ourselves to reading the various indications\r\nof nature as the lower animals have, we, too, might be able to read\r\nthese warnings of the coming earthquake.\r\n\r\nAt great distances from the place where the earthquake starts there\r\nwould necessarily be a better opportunity for predicting its approach.\r\nAs already stated, what is called an earthquake does not consist\r\nof a single shaking of the ground, but of a highly complex series\r\nof shakings. According to Mallet, the following waves start at the\r\nsame time from the place of origin of an earthquake, when located\r\non the bed of an ocean; i. e., an earth sound wave and a earth wave\r\nconstituting the earth's shake; a sound wave through the ocean,\r\nanother through the air; a sea wave called by him a forced sea wave,\r\nand finally the great sea wave.\r\n\r\nThese waves reach a distant point in the following order: the sound\r\nwave through the earth and the great earthquake or shake which\r\nproduces the damage. Then a smaller sea wave called the forced sea\r\nwave. This is followed almost immediately by the sound wave through\r\nthe sea. Next come the air sound wave and finally the great sea wave;\r\nwhich, rushing in on the shore, sweeps nearly everything before it.\r\n\r\nIn other words, the disturbances produced by the great earthquake\r\nfollow in this order of sequence. If, therefore, the great earthquake\r\nwave proper transmitted through the earth should for any reason be\r\ndelayed in reaching a distant place, the great sound waves should be\r\nable to give warning of the coming disturbances.\r\n\r\nAgain, as we have already seen, the earthquake wave is preceded by a\r\nnumber of preliminary tremors, and is followed by a number of after\r\ntremors or _earthquake echoes_. Since, therefore, the preliminary\r\nwaves reach a place first, it would seem that the approach of an\r\nearthquake must be heralded by the preliminary tremors. These,\r\nperhaps, at least in part, enable the lower animals to detect its\r\ncoming.\r\n\r\nAgain, in almost all instances there are a number of preliminary\r\nshocks that precede the great earthquake shock. Some of these\r\npreliminary shocks continue at intervals for several days or even\r\nlonger. Sometimes, indeed, these subterranean sounds fail to be\r\nfollowed by earthquakes. Milne thinks that these sounds are caused\r\nby the preliminary tremors which precede the principal shock of the\r\nearthquake and that they reach the place first. Here again then it\r\nis evident that, were we able to interpret properly these sounds, we\r\nwould probably be able to foretell the coming quake with a fair degree\r\nof certainty.\r\n\r\nThere would appear to be no reasonable doubt that in some manner\r\nwhich we have not yet been able to discover, but probably along some\r\nof the lines indicated above, animals are capable of recognizing a\r\ncoming earthquake. Long before the coming of the catastrophe they are\r\nsaid to exhibit extreme terror, and in many cases appear to seek the\r\ncompanionship of man, as if for protection.\r\n\r\nThat the senses of smell and hearing are far more acute in the lower\r\nanimals than in man no one can reasonably doubt. The manner in which\r\na trained dog can follow a scent, for a long time after the animal\r\nor thing producing it has passed, far exceeds the power of scent\r\npossessed by man, and it is more than likely that this same power is\r\npossessed by all animals who live upon or prey upon other animals. It\r\nis probable that faintly odorous vapors or gases escape from the crust\r\nshortly before the great shock occurs, and that these faint odors are\r\nwarnings to the animals of the approaching calamity. The sense of\r\nhearing also is much more acute in the lower animals.\r\n\r\nDaubeny is evidently of this belief, as will be seen from the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n      \"These gases and vapors (alluding to emanations given off\r\n      from the ground during earthquakes) exert an influence\r\n      on the barometer, which does appear to be indirectly\r\n      affected by the earthquake. Then, similar properties\r\n      also may occasion that uneasiness which animals are said\r\n      to evince before any such event. Thus, according to the\r\n      accounts of some writers, rats and mice leave their holes,\r\n      alligators seek the dry land, quadrupeds snuff the ground,\r\n      and manifest such signs of the impending calamity that in\r\n      countries where earthquakes are common, the inhabitants\r\n      take the alarm in consequence, and escape from their\r\n      houses. It is right, however, to add, that more recent\r\n      authorities dispute altogether the correctness of these\r\n      statements.\"\r\n\r\nDutton doubts the ability of animals to foretell coming earthquake\r\nshocks.\r\n\r\nBut that the lower animals do exhibit signs of fear at the approach of\r\nan earthquake has been repeatedly asserted by good observers.\r\n\r\nHamilton, who made a careful examination of the neighboring country\r\nduring the great earthquake at Calabria, asserts that horses and oxen\r\nduring the shocks extended their legs widely in order to avoid being\r\nthrown down, \"and that hogs, oxen, horses, and mules, and also geese,\r\nappeared to be painfully aware of the approach of the earthquake of\r\nCalabria; and the neighing of a horse, the braying of an ass, or the\r\ncackling of a goose, even when he (Hamilton) was making his survey\r\n(after the occurrence of the great earthquake shock), drove the people\r\nout of their temporary sheds in expectation of a shock.\"\r\n\r\nIt is asserted that birds appear to be especially sensible to a coming\r\nearthquake shock. That geese will quit the water in which they were\r\nswimming before the earthquake and will not return to it. It is quite\r\npossible that these birds with their heads immersed in the water can\r\nhear the distant murmurings long before they become audible in the air.\r\n\r\nVon Hoff makes the following statement:\r\n\r\n      \"It has been remarked that at such times (immediately\r\n      before the coming of an earthquake shock), domestic animals\r\n      showed a decided uneasiness, dogs howled mournfully, horses\r\n      neighed in an unusual manner, and poultry flew restlessly\r\n      about. These latter phenomena might easily be produced by\r\n      mephitic vapours, which often ascend to the surface of the\r\n      earth before the breaking out of an earthquake.\"\r\n\r\nMallet states that there is abundant evidence that earthquake shocks,\r\neven when not of very great intensity, produce nausea in both men and\r\nwomen. This would seem natural, since, as everyone knows, until one\r\nis accustomed to sea-voyages, merely to be tossed to and fro by the\r\nmotion of the waves results in the production of sea-sickness.\r\n\r\nIt has been also noticed that during earthquakes fish which under\r\nordinary circumstances live in the mud at the bottom of bodies of\r\nwater come near to the surface and at such times can be caught in\r\ngreat numbers.\r\n\r\nMallet cites the following effects produced by earthquakes:\r\n\r\n      \"Amongst the effects supposed to be produced by the\r\n      earthquake on the atmosphere were reckoned tempestuous\r\n      winds, thunder-storms, meteors, coldness of the air,\r\n      severe winters, heavy rains, miasmata, producing diseases\r\n      and affecting vegetation. A very remarkable instance of\r\n      the latter is quoted, namely, that in Peru, after the\r\n      earthquake of 1687, wheat and barley would not thrive at\r\n      all, though formerly the country was remarkably favourable\r\n      for them.\"\r\n\r\nSir Charles Lyell notes the following phenomena attending earthquakes:\r\n\r\n      \"Irregularities in the seasons preceding or following the\r\n      shocks; sudden gusts of wind, interrupted by dead calms;\r\n      violent rains at unusual seasons, or in countries where,\r\n      as a rule, they are almost unknown; a reddening of the\r\n      sun's disk, and haziness in the air, often continued for\r\n      months; an evolution of electric matter, or of inflammable\r\n      gas from the soil, with sulphurous and mephitic vapours;\r\n      noises underground, like the running of carriages, or\r\n      the discharge of artillery, or distant thunder; animals\r\n      uttering cries of distress, and evincing extraordinary\r\n      alarm, being more sensitive than men to the slightest\r\n      movement; a sensation like sea-sickness, and a dizziness in\r\n      the head, experienced by men. These, and other phenomena,\r\n      less connected with our present subject as geologists, have\r\n      recurred again and again at distant ages, and in all parts\r\n      of the globe.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A point on the other side of the earth directly opposite\r\na given point.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: A fracture of a stratum, or a general rock mass, with a\r\nrelative displacement of the opposite sides of the break.\r\n\r\nThe plane or fracture of a fault, known as the fault-plane, is seldom\r\nvertical.
