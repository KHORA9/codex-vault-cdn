I wonder what comes next?\" sighed Cabot Grant as he tumbled\r\nwearily into bed.\r\n\r\nThe day just ended marked the close of a most important era in his\r\nlife; for on it he had been graduated from the Technical Institute, in\r\nwhich he had studied his chosen profession, and the coveted sheepskin\r\nthat entitled him to sign M.E. in capital letters after his name had\r\nbeen in his possession but a few hours.\r\n\r\nAlthough Cabot came of an old New England family, and had been given\r\nevery educational advantage, he had not graduated with honours, having,\r\nin fact, barely scraped through his final examination.  He had devoted\r\naltogether too much time to athletics, and to the congenial task of\r\nacquiring popularity, to have much left for study.  Therefore, while it\r\nhad been pleasant to be one of the best-liked fellows in the Institute,\r\ncaptain of its football team, and a leading figure in the festivities\r\nof the day just ended, now that it was all over our lad was regretting\r\nthat he had not made a still better use of his opportunities.\r\n\r\nA number of his classmates had already been offered fine positions in\r\nthe business world now looming so ominously close before him.  Little\r\npale-faced Dick Chandler, for instance, was to start at once for South\r\nAfrica, in the interests of a wealthy corporation.  Ned Burnett was to\r\nbe assistant engineer of a famous copper mine; a world-renowned\r\nelectrical company had secured the services of Smith Redfield, and so\r\non through a dozen names, no one of which was as well known as his, but\r\nall outranking it on the graduate list of that day.\r\n\r\nCabot had often heard that the career of Institute students was closely\r\nwatched by individuals, firms, and corporations in need of young men\r\nfor responsible positions, and had more than once resolved to graduate\r\nwith a rank that should attract the attention of such persons.  But\r\nthere had been so much to do besides study that had seemed more\r\nimportant at the time, that he had allowed day after day to slip by\r\nwithout making the required effort, and now it appeared that no one\r\nwanted him.\r\n\r\nYes, there was one person who had made him a proposition that very day.\r\nThorpe Walling, the wealthiest fellow in the class, and one of its few\r\nmembers who had failed to gain a diploma, had said:\r\n\r\n\"Look here, Grant, what do you say to taking a year's trip around the\r\nworld with me, while I coach for a degree next June?  There is no such\r\neducator as travel, you know, and we'll make a point of going to all\r\nsorts of places where we can pick up ideas.  At the same time it'll be\r\nno end of a lark.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" Cabot had replied doubtfully, though his face had\r\nlighted at the mere idea of taking such a trip.  \"I'd rather do that\r\nthan almost anything else I know of, but----\"\r\n\r\n\"If you are thinking of the expense,\" broke in the other.\r\n\r\n\"It isn't that,\" interrupted Cabot, \"but it seems somehow as though I\r\nought to be doing something more in the line of business.  Anyway, I\r\ncan't give you an answer until I have seen my guardian, who has sent me\r\nword to meet him in New York day after to-morrow.  I'll let you know\r\nwhat he says, and if everything is all right, perhaps I'll go with you.\"\r\n\r\nWith this the matter had rested, and during the manifold excitements of\r\nthe day our lad had not given it another thought, until he tumbled into\r\nbed, wondering what would happen next.  Then for a long time he lay\r\nawake, considering Thorpe's proposition, and wishing that it had been\r\nmade by any other fellow in the class.\r\n\r\nUntil about the time of entering the Technical Institute, from which he\r\nwas just graduated, Cabot Grant, who was an only child, had been\r\nblessed with as happy a home as ever a boy enjoyed.  Then in a breath\r\nit was taken from him by a railway accident, that had caused the\r\ninstant death of his mother, and which the father had only survived\r\nlong enough to provide for his son's immediate future by making a will.\r\nBy its terms his slender fortune was placed in the hands of a trust and\r\ninvestment company, who were constituted the boy's guardians, and\r\nenjoined to give their ward a liberal education along such lines as he\r\nhimself might choose.\r\n\r\nThe corporation thus empowered had been faithful to its trust, and had\r\ncarried out to the letter the instructions of their deceased client\r\nduring the past five years.  Now less than a twelvemonth of their\r\nguardianship remained and it was to plan for his disposal of this time\r\nthat Cabot had been summoned to New York.\r\n\r\nHe had never met the president of the corporation, and it was with no\r\nlittle curiosity concerning him that he awaited, in a sumptuously\r\nappointed anteroom, his turn for an audience with the busy man.  At\r\nlength he was shown into a plainly furnished private office occupied by\r\nbut two persons, one somewhat past middle age, with a shrewd,\r\nsmooth-shaven face, and the other much younger, who was evidently a\r\nprivate secretary.\r\n\r\nOf course Cabot instantly knew the former to be President Hepburn; and\r\nalso, to his surprise, recognised him as one who had occupied a\r\nprominent position on the platform of the Institute hall when he had\r\ngraduated two days earlier.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Mr. Hepburn, in a crisp, business tone, as he noted the\r\nlad's flash of recognition, \"I happened to be passing through and\r\ndropped in to see our ward graduate.  I was, of course, disappointed\r\nthat you did not take higher rank.  At the same time I concluded not to\r\nmake myself known to you, for fear of interfering with some of your\r\nplans for the day.  It also seemed to me better that we should talk\r\nbusiness here.  Now, with your Institute career ended, how do you\r\npropose to spend the remainder of your minority?  I ask because, as you\r\ndoubtless know, our instructions are to consult your wishes in all\r\nmatters, and conform to them as far as possible.\"\r\n\r\n\"I appreciate your kindness in that respect,\" replied Cabot, who was\r\nsomewhat chilled by this business-like reception, \"and have decided, if\r\nthe funds remaining in your hands are sufficient for the purpose, to\r\nspend the coming year in foreign travel; in fact, to take a trip around\r\nthe world.\"\r\n\r\n\"With any definite object in view,\" inquired Mr. Hepburn, \"or merely\r\nfor pleasure?\"\r\n\r\n\"With the definite object of studying my chosen profession wherever I\r\nmay find it practised.\"\r\n\r\n\"Um!  Just so.  Do you propose to take this trip alone or in company?\"\r\n\r\n\"I propose to go with Thorpe Walling, one of my classmates.\"\r\n\r\n\"Son of the late General Walling, and a man who failed to graduate, is\r\nhe not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.  Do you know him?\"\r\n\r\n\"I knew his father, and wish you had chosen some other companion.\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not choose him.  He chose me, and invited me to go with him.\"\r\n\r\n\"At your own expense, I suppose?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly!  I could not have considered his proposition otherwise.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course not,\" agreed Mr. Hepburn, \"seeing that you have funds quite\r\nsufficient for such a venture, if used with economy.  And you have\r\ndecided that you would rather spend the ensuing year in foreign travel\r\nwith Thorpe Walling than do anything else?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I have, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, my boy.  While I cannot say that I consider your decision\r\nthe best that could be made, I have no valid objections to offer, and\r\nam bound to grant as far as possible your reasonable desires.  So you\r\nhave my consent to this scheme, if not my whole approval.  When do you\r\nplan to start?\"\r\n\r\n\"Thorpe wishes to go at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, if you will call here to-morrow morning at about this hour, I\r\nwill have arranged for your letter of credit, and anything else that\r\nmay suggest itself for making your trip a pleasant one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, sir,\" said Cabot, who, believing the interview to be ended,\r\nturned to leave the room.\r\n\r\n\"By the way,\" continued Mr. Hepburn, \"there is another thing I wish to\r\nmention.  Can you recommend one of your recent classmates for an\r\nimportant mission, to be undertaken at once to an out-of-the-way part\r\nof the world?  He must be a young man of good morals, able to keep his\r\nbusiness affairs to himself, not afraid of hard work, and willing as\r\nwell as physically able to endure hardships.  His intelligence and\r\nmental fitness will, of course, be guaranteed by the Institute's\r\ndiploma.  Our company is in immediate need of such a person, and will\r\nengage him at a good salary for a year, with certain prospects of\r\nadvancement, if he gives satisfaction.  Think it over and let me know\r\nin the morning if you have hit upon one whom you believe would meet\r\nthose requirements.  In the meantime please do not mention the subject\r\nto any one.\"\r\n\r\nCharged with this commission, and relieved that the dreaded interview\r\nwas ended, Cabot hastened uptown to a small secret society club of\r\nwhich he was a non-resident member.  There he wrote a note to Thorpe\r\nWalling, accepting his invitation, and expressing a readiness to set\r\nforth at once on their proposed journey.  This done, he joined a group\r\nof fellows who were discussing summer plans in the reading-room.\r\n\r\n\"What are you going in for, Grant?\" asked one.  \"Is your summer to be\r\ndevoted to work or play?\"\r\n\r\n\"Both,\" laughed Cabot.  \"Thorpe Walling and I are to take an\r\neducational trip around the world, during which we hope to have great\r\nfun and accomplish much work.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ho, ho!\" jeered he who had put the question.  \"That's a good one.  The\r\nidea of coupling 'Torpid' Walling's name with anything that savors of\r\nwork.  You'll have a good time fast enough.  But I'll wager anything\r\nyou like, that in his company you will circumnavigate the globe without\r\nhaving done any work harder than spending money.  No, no, my dear boy,\r\n'Torpid' is not the chap to encourage either mental or physical effort\r\nin his associates.  Better hunt some other companion, or even go by\r\nyour lonely, if you really want to accomplish anything.\"\r\n\r\nThese words recurred to our lad many times during the day, and when he\r\nfinally fell asleep that night, after fruitlessly wondering who of his\r\nmany friends he should recommend to President Hepburn, they were still\r\nringing in his ears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nAN OFFER OF EMPLOYMENT.\r\n\r\nThorpe Walling had never been one of Cabot Grant's particular friends,\r\nnor did the latter now regard with unmixed pleasure the idea of a\r\nyear's intimate association with him.  He had accepted the latter's\r\ninvitation because nothing else seemed likely to offer, and he could\r\nnot bear to have the other fellows, especially those whose class\r\nstanding had secured them positions, imagine that he was not also in\r\ndemand.  Besides, the thought of a trip around the world was certainly\r\nvery enticing; any opposition to the plan would have rendered him the\r\nmore desirous of carrying it out.  But in his interview with his\r\nguardian he had gained his point so easily that the concession\r\nimmediately lost half its value.  Even as he wrote his note to Thorpe\r\nhe wondered if he really wanted to go with him, and after that\r\nconversation in the club reading-room he was almost certain that he did\r\nnot.  If Mr. Hepburn had only offered him employment, how gladly he\r\nwould have accepted it and declined Thorpe's invitation; but his\r\nguardian had merely asked him to recommend some one else.\r\n\r\n\"Which shows,\" thought Cabot bitterly, \"what he thinks of me, and of my\r\nfitness for any position of importance.  He is right, too, for if ever\r\na fellow threw away opportunities, I have done so during the past four\r\nyears.  And now I am deliberately going to spend another, squandering\r\nmy last dollar, in company with a chap who will have no further use for\r\nme when it is gone.  It really begins to look as though I were about\r\nthe biggest fool of my acquaintance.\"\r\n\r\nIt was in this frame of mind that our young engineer made a second\r\nvisit to his guardian's office on the following morning.  There he was\r\nreceived by Mr. Hepburn with the same business-like abruptness that had\r\nmarked their interview of the day before.\r\n\r\n\"Good-morning, Cabot,\" he said.  \"I see you are promptly on hand, and,\r\nI suppose, anxious to be off.  Well, I don't blame you, for a pleasure\r\ntrip around the world isn't offered to every young fellow, and I wish I\r\nwere in a position to take such a one myself.  I have had prepared a\r\nletter of credit for the balance of your property remaining in our\r\nhands, and while it probably is not as large a sum as your friend\r\nWalling will carry, it is enough to see you through very comfortably,\r\nif you exercise a reasonable economy.  I have also written letters of\r\nintroduction to our agents in several foreign cities that may prove\r\nuseful.  Let me hear from you occasionally, and I trust you will have\r\nfully as good a time as you anticipate.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, sir,\" said Cabot.  \"You are very kind.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all.  I am only striving to carry out your father's\r\ninstructions, and do what he paid to have done.  Now, how about the\r\nyoung man you were to recommend?  Have you thought of one?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir, I haven't.  You see, all the fellows who graduated with\r\nhonours found places waiting for them, and as I knew you would only\r\nwant one of the best, I can't think of one whom I can recommend for\r\nyour purpose.  I am very sorry, but----\"\r\n\r\n\"I fear I did not make our requirements quite clear,\" interrupted Mr.\r\nHepburn, \"since I did not mean to convey the impression that we would\r\nemploy none but an honour man.  It often happens that he who ranks\r\nhighest as a student fails of success in the business world; and under\r\ncertain conditions I would employ the man who graduated lowest in his\r\nclass rather than him who stood at its head.\"\r\n\r\nCabot's face expressed his amazement at this statement, and noting it,\r\nMr. Hepburn smiled as he continued:\r\n\r\n\"The mere fact that a young man has graduated from your Institute, even\r\nthough it be with low rank, insures his possession of technical\r\nknowledge sufficient for our purpose.  If, at the same time, he is a\r\ngentleman endowed with the faculty of making friends, as well as an\r\nathlete willing to meet and able to overcome physical difficulties, I\r\nwould employ him in preference to a more studious person who lacked any\r\nof these qualifications.  If you, for instance, had not already decided\r\nupon a plan for spending the ensuing year, I should not hesitate to\r\noffer you the position we desire to fill.\"\r\n\r\nCabot trembled with excitement.  \"I--Mr. Hepburn!\" he exclaimed.\r\n\"Would you really have offered it to me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly I would.  I desired you to meet me here for that very\r\npurpose; but when I found you had made other arrangements that might\r\nprove equally advantageous, I believed I was meeting your father's\r\nwishes by helping you carry them out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is the place still open, and can I have it?\" asked Cabot eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"Not if you are going around the world; for, although the duties of the\r\nposition will include a certain amount of travel, it will not be in\r\nthat direction.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I don't want to go around the world, and would rather take the\r\nposition you have to offer than do anything else I know of,\" declared\r\nCabot.\r\n\r\n\"Without knowing its requirements, what hardships it may present, nor\r\nin what direction it may lead you?\" inquired the other.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.  So long as you offer it I would accept it without question,\r\neven though it should be a commission to discover the North Pole.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear boy,\" said Mr. Hepburn, in an entirely different tone from\r\nthat he had hitherto used, \"I trust I may never forfeit nor abuse the\r\nconfidence implied by these words.  Although you did not know it, I\r\nhave carefully watched every step of your career during the past five\r\nyears, and while you have done some things, as well as developed some\r\ntraits, that are to be regretted, I am satisfied that you are at least\r\nworthy of a trial in the position we desire to fill.  So, if you are\r\nwilling to relinquish your proposed trip around the world, and enter\r\nthe employ of this company instead, you may consider yourself engaged\r\nfor the term of one year from this date.  During that time all your\r\nlegitimate expenses will be met, but no salary will be paid you until\r\nthe expiration of the year, when its amount will be determined by the\r\nvalue of the services you have rendered.  Is that satisfactory?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is, sir,\" replied Cabot, \"and with your permission I will at once\r\ntelegraph Thorpe Walling that I cannot go with him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Write your despatch here and I will have it sent out.  At the same\r\ntime, do not mention that you have entered the employ of this company,\r\nas there are reasons why, for the present at least, that should remain\r\na secret.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Cabot's telegram was ready, Mr. Hepburn, who had been glancing\r\nthrough a number of letters that awaited his signature, handed it to\r\nhis secretary, to whom he also gave some instructions that Cabot did\r\nnot catch.  As the former left the room, the president turned to our\r\nyoung engineer and said:\r\n\r\n\"As perhaps you are aware, Cabot, there is at present an unprecedented\r\ndemand all over the world for both iron and copper, and our company is\r\nlargely interested in the production of these metals.  As existing\r\nsources of supply are inadequate it is of importance that new ones\r\nshould be discovered, and if they can be found on the Atlantic\r\nseaboard, so much the better.  In looking about for new fields that may\r\nbe profitably worked, our attention has been directed to the island of\r\nNewfoundland and the coast of Labrador.  While the former has been\r\npartially explored, we desire more definite information as to its\r\navailable ore beds.  There is a small island in Conception Bay, not far\r\nfrom St. Johns, known as Bell Island, said to be a mass of iron ore,\r\nthat is already being worked by a local company.  From it I should like\r\nto have a report, as soon as you reach St. Johns, concerning the nature\r\nof the ore, the extent of the deposit, the cost of mining it, the\r\npresent output, the facilities for shipment, and so forth.  At the same\r\ntime I want you to obtain this information without divulging the nature\r\nof your business, or allowing your name to become in any way connected\r\nwith this company.\r\n\r\n\"Having finished with Bell Island, you will visit such other portions\r\nof Newfoundland as are readily accessible from the coast, and seem to\r\npromise good results, always keeping to yourself the true nature of\r\nyour business.  Finally, you will proceed to Labrador, where you will\r\nmake such explorations as are possible.  You will report any\r\ndiscoveries in person, when you return to New York, as I do not care to\r\nhave them entrusted to the mails.  Above all, do not fail to bring back\r\nspecimens of whatever you may find in the way of minerals.  Are these\r\ninstructions sufficiently clear?\"\r\n\r\n\"They seem so, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, then.  I wish you to start this very day, as I find that a\r\nsteamer, on which your passage is already engaged, sails from a\r\nBrooklyn pier for St. Johns this afternoon.  This letter of credit,\r\nwhich only awaits your signature before a notary, will, if deposited\r\nwith the bank of Nova Scotia in St. Johns, more than defray your year's\r\nexpenses, and whatever you can save from it will be added to your\r\nsalary.  Therefore, it will pay you to practise economy, though you\r\nmust not hesitate to incur legitimate expenses or to spend money when\r\nby so doing you can further the objects of your journey.  You have\r\nenough money for your immediate needs, have you not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.  I have about fifty dollars.\"\r\n\r\n\"That will be ample, since your ticket to St. Johns is already paid\r\nfor.  Here it is.\"\r\n\r\nThus saying, Mr. Hepburn handed over an envelope containing the\r\nsteamship ticket that his secretary had been sent out to obtain.\r\n\r\n\"I would take as little baggage as possible,\" he continued, \"for you\r\ncan purchase everything necessary in St. Johns, and will discover what\r\nyou need after you get there.  Now, good-bye, my boy.  God bless you\r\nand bring you back in safety.  Remember that the coming year will\r\nprobably prove the most important of your life, and that your future\r\nnow depends entirely upon yourself.  Mr. Black here will go with you to\r\nthe banker's, where you can sign your letter of credit.\"\r\n\r\nSo our young engineer was launched on the sea of business life.  Two\r\nhours later he had packed a dress-suit case and sent his trunk down to\r\nthe company's building for storage.  On his way to the steamer he\r\nstopped at his club for a bite of lunch, and as he was leaving the\r\nbuilding he encountered the friend with whom he had discussed his plans\r\nthe day before.\r\n\r\n\"Hello!\" exclaimed that individual, \"where are you going in such a\r\nhurry.  Not starting off on your year of travel, are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" laughed Cabot.  \"I am to sail within an hour.  Good-bye!\"\r\n\r\nWith this he ran down the steps and jumped into a waiting cab.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE STRANGE FATE OF A STEAMER.\r\n\r\nSo exciting had been the day, and so fully had its every minute been\r\noccupied, that not until Cabot stood on the deck of the steamer\r\n\"Lavinia,\" curiously watching the bustling preparations for her\r\ndeparture, did he have time to realise the wonderful change in his\r\nprospects that had taken place within a few hours.  That morning his\r\nlife had seemed wholly aimless, and he had been filled with envy of\r\nthose among his recent classmates whose services were in demand.  Now\r\nhe would not change places with any one of them; for was not he, too,\r\nentrusted with an important mission that held promise of a brilliant\r\nfuture in case he should carry it to a successful conclusion?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: On the deck of the steamer \"Lavinia.\"]\r\n\r\n\"And I will,\" he mentally resolved.  \"No matter what happens, if I live\r\nI will succeed.\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of this brave resolve our lad could not help feeling rather\r\nforlorn as he watched those about him, all of whom seemed to have\r\nfriends to see them off; while he alone stood friendless and unnoticed.\r\n\r\nEspecially was his attention attracted to a nearby group of girls\r\ngathered about one who was evidently a bride.  They were full of gay\r\nchatter, and he overheard one of them say:\r\n\r\n\"If you come within sight of an iceberg, Nelly, make him go close to it\r\nso you can get a good photograph.  I should like awfully to have one.\"\r\n\r\n\"So should I,\" cried another.  \"But, oh! wouldn't it be lovely if we\r\ncould only have a picture of this group, standing just as we are aboard\r\nthe ship.  It would make a splendid beginning for your camera.\"\r\n\r\nThe bride, who, as Cabot saw, carried a small brand-new camera similar\r\nto one he had recently procured for his own use, promptly expressed her\r\nwillingness to employ it as suggested, but was greeted by a storm of\r\nprotests from her companions.\r\n\r\n\"No, indeed!  You must be in it of course!\" they cried.\r\n\r\nThen it further transpired that all wished to be \"in it,\" and no one\r\nwanted to act the part of photographer.  At this juncture Cabot stepped\r\nforward, and lifting his cap, said:\r\n\r\n\"I am somewhat of a photographer, and with your permission it would\r\nafford me great pleasure to take a picture of so charming a group.\"\r\n\r\nFor a moment the girls looked at the presumptuous young stranger in\r\nsilence.  Then the bride, flushing prettily, stepped forward and handed\r\nhim her camera, saying as she did so:\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, sir, ever so much for your kind offer, which we are glad to\r\naccept.\"\r\n\r\nSo Cabot arranged the group amid much laughter, and by the time two\r\nplates had been exposed, had made rapid progress towards getting\r\nacquainted with its several members.\r\n\r\nThe episode was barely ended before all who were to remain behind were\r\nordered ashore, and, a few minutes later, as the ship began to move\r\nslowly from her dock, our traveller found himself waving his\r\nhandkerchief and shouting good-byes as vigorously as though all on the\r\nwharf were assembled for the express purpose of bidding him farewell.\r\n\r\nBy the time the \"Lavinia\" was in the stream and headed up the East\r\nRiver, with her long voyage fairly begun, Cabot had learned that his\r\nnew acquaintance was a bride of but a few hours, having been married\r\nthat morning to the captain of that very steamer.  She had hardly made\r\nthis confession when her husband, temporarily relieved of his\r\nresponsibilities by a pilot, came in search of her and was duly\r\npresented to our hero.  His name was Phinney, and he so took to Cabot\r\nthat from that moment the latter no longer found himself lonely or at a\r\nloss for occupation.\r\n\r\nAs he had never before been at sea, the voyage proved full of interest,\r\nand his intelligent questions received equally intelligent answers from\r\nCaptain Phinney, who was a well-informed young man but a few years\r\nolder than Cabot, and an enthusiast in his calling.\r\n\r\nUp Long Island Sound went the \"Lavinia,\" and it was late that night\r\nbefore our lad turned in, so interested was he in watching the many\r\nlights that were pointed out by his new acquaintance.  The next morning\r\nfound the ship threading her way amid the shoals of Nantucket Sound,\r\nafter which came the open sea; and for the first time in his life Cabot\r\nlost sight of land.  Halifax was reached on the following day, and here\r\nthe steamer remained twenty-four hours discharging freight.\r\n\r\nThe capital of Nova Scotia marks the half-way point between New York\r\nand St. Johns, Newfoundland, which name Cabot was already learning to\r\npronounce as do its inhabitants--Newfund-_land_--and after leaving it\r\nthe ship was again headed for the open across the wide mouth of the\r\nGulf of St. Lawrence.  Thus far the weather had been fine, the sea\r\nsmooth, and nothing had occurred to break the pleasant monotony of the\r\nvoyage.  Its chief interests lay in sighting distant sails, the\r\ntell-tale smoke pennons of far-away steamers, the plume-like spoutings\r\nof sluggishly moving whales, the darting of porpoises about the ship's\r\nfore-foot, the wide circling overhead of gulls, or the dainty skimming\r\njust above the wave crests of Mother Carey's fluffy chickens.\r\n\r\n\"Who was Mother Carey,\" asked Cabot, \"and why are they her chickens?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have been told that she was the _Mater Cara_ of devout Portuguese\r\nsailors,\" replied Captain Phinney, \"and that these tiny sea-fowl are\r\nsupposed to be under her especial protection, since the fiercest of\r\ngales have no power to harm them.\"\r\n\r\n\"How queerly names become changed and twisted out of their original\r\nshape,\" remarked Cabot meditatively.  \"The idea of _Mater Cara_\r\nbecoming Mother Carey!\"\r\n\r\n\"That is an easy change compared with some others I have run across,\"\r\nlaughed the captain.  \"For instance, I once put up at an English\r\nseaport tavern called the 'Goat and Compasses,' and found out that its\r\noriginal name, given in Cromwell's time, had been 'God Encompasseth\r\nUs.'  Almost as curious is the present name of that portion of the\r\nNewfoundland coast nearest us at this minute.  It is called\r\n'Ferryland,' which is a corruption of 'Verulam,' the name applied by\r\nits original owner, Lord Baltimore, in memory of his home estate in\r\nEngland.  In fact, this region abounds in queerly twisted names, most\r\nof which were originally French.  Bai d'espair, for instance, has\r\nbecome Bay Despair.  Blanc Sablon and Isle du Bois up on the Labrador\r\ncoast have been Anglicised as Nancy Belong and Boys' Island.  Cape\r\nRace, which is almost within sight, was the Capo Razzo of its\r\nPortuguese discoverer.  Cape Spear was Cappo Sperenza, and Pointe\r\nl'Amour is now Lammer's Point.\"\r\n\r\nWhile taking part in conversations of this kind both Cabot and Mrs.\r\nPhinney, who were the only passengers now left on the ship, kept a\r\nsharp lookout for icebergs, which, as they had learned, were apt to be\r\nmet in those waters at that season.  Finally, during the afternoon of\r\nthe last day they expected to spend on shipboard, a distant white speck\r\ndead ahead, which was at first taken for a sail, proved to be an\r\niceberg, and from that moment it was watched with the liveliest\r\ncuriosity.  Before their rapid approach it developed lofty pinnacles,\r\nand proved of the most dazzling whiteness, save at the water line,\r\nwhere it was banded with vivid blue.  It was exquisitely chiselled and\r\ncarved into dainty forms by the gleaming rivulets that ran down its\r\nsteep sides and fell into the sea as miniature cascades.  So\r\nwonderfully beautiful were the icy details as they were successively\r\nunfolded, that the bride begged her husband to take his ship just as\r\nclose as possible, in order that she might obtain a perfect photograph.\r\nAnxious to gratify her every wish, Captain Phinney readily consented,\r\nand the ship's course was slightly altered, so as to pass within one\r\nhundred feet of the glistening monster, which was now sharply outlined\r\nagainst a dark bank of fog rolling heavily in from the eastward.\r\n\r\nBoth cameras had been kept busy from the time the berg came within\r\nrange of their finders, but just as the best point of view was reached,\r\nand when they were so near that the chill of the ice was distinctly\r\nfelt, Cabot discovered that he had exhausted his roll of films.\r\nUttering an exclamation of disgust, he ran aft and down to his\r\nstateroom, that opened from the lower saloon, to secure another\r\ncartridge.  As he entered the room, he closed its door to get at his\r\ndress-suit case that lay behind it.\r\n\r\nRecklessly tossing the contents of the case right and left, he had just\r\nlaid hands on the desired object and was rising to his feet when,\r\nwithout warning, he was flung violently to the floor by a shock like\r\nthat of an earthquake.  It was accompanied by a dull roar and an awful\r\nsound of crashing and rending.  At the same time the ship seemed to be\r\nlifted bodily.  Then she fell back, apparently striking on her side,\r\nand for several minutes rolled with sickening lurches, as though in the\r\ntrough of a heavy sea.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Cabot was struggling furiously to open his stateroom\r\ndoor; but it had so jammed in its casing that his utmost efforts failed\r\nto move it.  The steel deck beams overhead were twisted like willow\r\nwands, the iron side of the ship was crumpled as though it were a sheet\r\nof paper, and with every downward lurch a torrent of icy water poured\r\nin about the air port, which, though still closed, had been wrenched\r\nout of position.  With a horrid dread the prisoner realised that unless\r\nquickly released he must drown where he was, and, unable to open the\r\ndoor, he began to kick at it with the hope of smashing one of its\r\npanels.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: He began to kick at it with the hope of smashing one of\r\nits panels.]\r\n\r\nWith his first effort in this direction there came another muffled roar\r\nlike that of an explosion, and he felt the ship quiver as though it\r\nwere being rent in twain.  At the same moment his door flew open of its\r\nown accord, and he was nearly suffocated by an inrush of steam.\r\nSpringing forward, and blindly groping his way through this, the\r\nbewildered lad finally reached the stairs he had so recently descended.\r\nIn another minute he had gained the deck, where he stood gasping for\r\nbreath and vainly trying to discover what terrible thing had happened.\r\n\r\nNot a human being was to be seen, and the forward part of the ship was\r\nconcealed beneath a dense cloud of steam and smoke that hung over it\r\nlike a pall.  Cabot fancied he could distinguish shouting in that\r\ndirection, and attempted to gain the point from which it seemed to\r\ncome; but found the way barred by a yawning opening in the deck, from\r\nwhich poured smoke and flame as though it were the crater of a volcano.\r\nThen he ran back, and at length found himself on top of the after\r\nhouse, cutting with his pocket knife at the lashings of a life raft;\r\nfor he realised that the ship was sinking so rapidly that she might\r\nplunge to the bottom at any moment.\r\n\r\nFive minutes later he lay prone on the buoyant raft, clutching the\r\nsides of its wooden platform, while it spun like a storm-driven leaf in\r\nthe vortex marking the spot where the ill-fated.  \"Lavinia\" had sunk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nALONE ON THE LIFE RAFT.\r\n\r\nAnything less buoyant than a modern life raft, consisting of two steel\r\ncylinders stoutly braced and connected by a wooden platform, would have\r\nbeen drawn under by the deadly clutch of that swirling vortex.  No open\r\nboat could have lived in it for a minute; and even the raft, spinning\r\nround and round with dizzy velocity, was sucked downward until it was\r\nactually below the level of the surrounding water.  But, sturdily\r\nresisting the down-dragging force, its wonderful buoyancy finally\r\ntriumphed, and as its rotary motion became less rapid, Cabot sat up and\r\ngazed about him with the air of one who has been stunned.\r\n\r\nHe was dazed by the awfulness of the catastrophe that had so suddenly\r\noverwhelmed the \"Lavinia,\" and could form no idea of its nature.  Had\r\nthere been a collision?  If so, it must have been with the iceberg, for\r\nnothing else had been in sight when he went below.  Yet it was\r\nincredible that such a thing could have happened in broad daylight.\r\nThe afternoon had been clear and bright; of that he was certain, though\r\nhis surroundings were now shrouded by an impenetrable veil of fog.\r\nThrough this he could see nothing, and from it came no sound save the\r\nmoan of winds sweeping across a limitless void of waters.\r\n\r\nWhat had become of his recent companions?  Had they gone down with the\r\nship, and was he sole survivor of the tragedy?  At this thought the lad\r\nsprang to his feet, and shouted, calling his friends by name, and\r\nbegging them not to leave him; but the only answer came in shape of\r\nmocking echoes hurled sharply back from close at hand.  Looking in that\r\ndirection, he dimly discerned a vast outline of darker substance than\r\nthe enveloping mist.  From it came also a sound of falling waters, and\r\nagainst it the sea was beating angrily.  At the same time he was\r\nconscious of a deadly chill in the air, and came to a sudden\r\ncomprehension that the iceberg, to which he attributed all his present\r\ndistress, was still close at hand.\r\n\r\nIts mere presence brought a new terror; for he knew that unless the\r\nattraction of its great bulk could be overcome, his little raft must\r\nspeedily be drawn to it and dashed helplessly against its icy cliffs.\r\nThis thought filled him with a momentary despair, for there seemed no\r\npossibility of avoiding the impending fate.  Then his eyes fell on a\r\npair of oars lashed, together with their metal rowlocks, to the sides\r\nof his raft.  In another minute he had shipped these and was pulling\r\nwith all his might away from that ill-omened neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nThe progress of his clumsy craft was painfully slow; but it did move,\r\nand at the end the dreaded ice monster was beyond both sight and\r\nhearing.  The exercise of rowing had warmed Cabot as well as\r\ntemporarily diverted his mind from a contemplation of the terrible\r\nscenes through which he had so recently passed.  Now, however, as he\r\nrested on his oars, a full sense of his wretched plight came back to\r\nhim, and he grew sick at heart as he realised how forlorn was his\r\nsituation.  He wondered if he could survive the night that was rapidly\r\nclosing in on him, and, if he did, whether the morrow would find him\r\nany better off.  He had no idea of the direction in which wind and\r\ncurrent were drifting him, whether further out to sea or towards the\r\nland.  He was again shivering with cold, he was hungry and thirsty, and\r\nso filled with terror at the black waters leaping towards him from all\r\nsides that he finally flung himself face downward on the wet platform\r\nto escape from seeing them.\r\n\r\nWhen he next lifted his head he found himself in utter darkness,\r\nthrough which he fancied he could still hear the sound of waters\r\ndashing against frigid cliffs, and with an access of terror he once\r\nmore sprang to his oars.  Now he rowed with the wind, keeping it as\r\ndirectly astern as possible; nor did he pause in his efforts until\r\ncompelled by exhaustion.  Then he again lay down, and this time dropped\r\ninto a fitful doze.\r\n\r\nWaking a little later with chattering teeth, he resumed his oars for\r\nthe sake of warming exercise, and again rowed as long as he was able.\r\nSo, with alternating periods of weary work and unrefreshing rest, the\r\nslow dragging hours of that interminable night were spent.  Finally,\r\nafter he had given up all hope of ever again seeing a gleam of\r\nsunshine, a faint gray began to permeate the fog that still held him in\r\nits wet embrace, and Cabot knew that he had lived to see the beginnings\r\nof another day.\r\n\r\nTo make sure that the almost imperceptible light really marked the\r\ndawn, he shut his eyes and resolutely kept them closed until he had\r\ncounted five hundred.  Then he opened them, and almost screamed with\r\nthe joy of being able to trace the outlines of his raft.  Again and\r\nagain he did this until at length the black night shadows had been\r\nfairly vanquished and only those of the fog remained.\r\n\r\nWith the assurance that day had fairly come, and that the dreaded\r\niceberg was at least not close at hand, Cabot again sought\r\nforgetfulness of his misery in sleep.  When he awoke some hours later,\r\naching in every bone, and painfully hungry, he was also filled with a\r\ndelicious sense of warmth; for the sun, already near its meridian, was\r\nshining as brightly as though no such things as fog or darkness had\r\never existed.\r\n\r\nOn standing up and looking about him, the young castaway was relieved\r\nto note that the iceberg from which he had suffered so much was no\r\nlonger in sight.  At the same time he was grievously disappointed that\r\nhe could discover no sail nor other token that any human being save\r\nhimself was abroad on all that lonely sea.\r\n\r\nHe experienced a momentary exhilaration when, on turning to the west,\r\nhe discovered a dark far-reaching line that he believed to be land; but\r\nhis spirits fell as he measured the distance separating him from it,\r\nand realised how slight a chance he had of ever gaining the coast.  To\r\nbe sure, the light breeze then blowing was in that direction, but it\r\nmight change at any moment; and even with it to aid his rowing he\r\ndoubted if his clumsy craft could make more than a mile an hour.  Thus\r\ndarkness would again overtake him ere he had covered more than half the\r\nrequired distance, though he should row steadily during the remainder\r\nof the day.  He knew that his growing weakness would demand intervals\r\nof rest with ever-increasing frequency until utter exhaustion should\r\nput an end to his efforts; and then what would become of him?  Still\r\nthere was nothing else to be done; and, with a dogged determination to\r\ndie fighting, if die he must, the poor lad sat down and resumed his\r\nhopeless task.\r\n\r\nA life raft is not intended to be used as a rowboat, and is unprovided\r\nwith either seats or foot braces.  Being thus compelled to sit on the\r\nplatform, Cabot could get so little purchase that half his effort was\r\nwasted, and the progress made was barely noticeable.  During his\r\nfrequent pauses for rest he stood up to gaze longingly at the goal that\r\nstill appeared as far away as ever, and grew more unattainable as the\r\nday wore on.  At length the sun was well down the western sky, across\r\nwhich it appeared to race as never before.  As Cabot watched it, and\r\nvaguely wished for the power once given to Joshua, the bleakness of\r\ndespair suddenly enfolded him, and his eyes became blurred with tears.\r\nHe covered them with his hands to shut out the mocking sunlight, and\r\nsat down because he was too weak to stand any longer.  He had fought\r\nhis fight very nearly to a finish, and his strength was almost gone.\r\nHe had perhaps brought his craft five miles nearer to the land than it\r\nwas when he set out; but after all what had been the gain?  Apparently\r\nthere was none, and he would not further torture his aching body with\r\nuseless effort.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime a small schooner, bringing with her a fair wind, was\r\nrunning rapidly down the coast, not many miles from where our poor lad\r\nso despairingly awaited the coming of night.  That he had not seen her\r\nwhile standing up, was owing to the fact that her sails, instead of\r\nbeing white, were tanned a dull red, that blended perfectly with the\r\ncolour of the distant shore line.  A bright-faced, resolute chap,\r\nsomewhat younger than Cabot, but of equally sturdy build, held the\r\ntiller, and regarded with evident approval the behaviour of his\r\nspeeding craft.\r\n\r\n\"We'll make it, Dave,\" he cried, cheerily.  \"The old 'Sea Bee's' got\r\nthe wings of 'em this time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mebbe so,\" growled the individual addressed, an elderly man who stood\r\nin the companionway, with his head just above the hatch, peering\r\nforward under the swelling sails.  \"Mebbe so,\" he repeated, \"and mebbe\r\nnot.  Steam's hard to beat on land or water, an' we be a far cry from\r\nPretty Harbour yet.  So fur that ef they're started they'll overhaul us\r\nbefore day, and beat us in by a good twelve hour.  It's what I'm\r\nlooking fur.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, pshaw!\" replied the young skipper.  \"What a gammy old croaker you\r\nare.  They won't start to-day, anyhow.  But here, take her a minute,\r\nwhile I go aloft for one more look before sundown to make sure.\"\r\n\r\nAs the man complied with this request, and waddling aft took the\r\ntiller, his more active companion sprang into the main rigging and ran\r\nrapidly to the masthead, from which point of vantage he gazed back for\r\na full minute over the course they had come.\r\n\r\n\"Not a sign,\" he shouted down at length.  \"But hello,\" he added to\r\nhimself, \"what's that?\"  With a glance seaward his keen eye had\r\ndetected a distant floating object that was momentarily uplifted on the\r\nback of a long swell, and flashed white in the rays of the setting sun.\r\n\r\n\"Luff her, David!  Hard down with your hellum, and trim in all,\" he\r\nshouted to the steersman.  \"There, steady, so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wot's hup?\" inquired the man a few minutes later, as the other\r\nrejoined him on deck.\r\n\r\n\"Don't know for sure; but there's something floating off there that\r\nlooks like a bit of wreckage.\"\r\n\r\n\"An' you, with all your hurry, going to stop fur a closer look, and\r\nlose time that'll mebbe prove the most wallyable of your life,\" growled\r\nthe man disgustedly.  \"Wal, I'll be jiggered!\"\r\n\r\n\"So would I, if I didn't,\" replied the lad.  \"It was one of dad's rules\r\nnever to pass any kind of a wreck without at least one good look at it,\r\nand so it's one of mine as well.  There's what I'm after, now.  See,\r\njust off the starboard bow.  It's a raft, and David, there's a man on\r\nit, sure as you live.  Look, he's standing up and waving at us.  Now,\r\nhe's down again!  Poor fellow!  In with the jib, David!  Spry now, and\r\nstand by with a line.  I'm going to round up, right alongside.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nWHITE BALDWIN AND HIS \"SEA BEE.\"\r\n\r\nThe hour that preceded the coming of that heaven-sent schooner was the\r\nblackest of Cabot Grant's life, and as he sat with bowed head on the\r\nwet platform of his tossing raft he was utterly hopeless.  He believed\r\nthat he should never again hear a human voice nor tread the blessed\r\nland--yes, everything was ended for him, or very nearly so, and\r\nwhatever record he had made in life must now stand without addition or\r\ncorrection.  His thoughts went back as far as he could remember\r\nanything, and every act of his life was clearly recalled.  How mean\r\nsome of them now appeared; how thoughtless, indifferent, or selfish he\r\nhad been in others.  Latterly how he had been filled with a sense of\r\nhis own importance, how he had worked and schemed for a little\r\npopularity, and now who would regret him, or give his memory more than\r\na passing thought?\r\n\r\nThorpe Walling would say: \"Served him right for throwing me over, as he\r\ndid,\" and others would agree with him.  Even Mr. Hepburn, who had\r\ndoubtless given him a chance merely because he was his guardian, would\r\neasily find a better man to put in his place.  Some cousins whom he had\r\nnever seen nor cared to know would rejoice on coming into possession of\r\nhis little property; and so, on the whole, his disappearance would\r\ncause more of satisfaction than regret.  Most bitter of all was the\r\nthought that he would never have the opportunity of changing, or at\r\nleast of trying to change, this state of affairs, since he had\r\ndoubtless looked at the sun for the last time, and the blackness of an\r\nendless night was about to enfold him.\r\n\r\nHad he really seen his last ray of sunlight and hope?  No; it could not\r\nbe.  There must be a gleam left.  The sun could not have set yet.  He\r\nlifted his head.  There was no sun to be seen.  With a cry of terror he\r\nsprang to his feet, and, from the slight elevation thus gained, once\r\nmore beheld the mighty orb of day, and life, and promise, crowning with\r\na splendour infinitely beyond anything of this earth, the distant\r\nshore-line that he had striven so stoutly to gain.\r\n\r\nDazzled by its radiance, Cabot saw nothing else during the minute that\r\nit lingered above the horizon.  Then, as it disappeared, he uttered\r\nanother cry, but this time it was one of incredulous and joyful\r\namazement, for close at hand, coming directly towards him from out the\r\nwestern glory, was a ship bearing a new lease of life and freighted\r\nwith new opportunities.\r\n\r\nThe poor lad tried to wave his cap at the new-comers; but after a\r\nfeeble attempt sank to his knees, overcome by weakness and gratitude.\r\nIt was in that position they found him as the little schooner was\r\nrounded sharply into the wind, and, with fluttering sails, lay close\r\nalongside the drifting raft.\r\n\r\nDavid flung a line that Cabot found strength to catch and hold to,\r\nwhile the young skipper of the \"Sea Bee\" sprang over her low rail and\r\nalighted beside the castaway just as the latter staggered to his feet\r\nwith outstretched hand.  The stranger grasped it tightly in both of\r\nhis, and for a moment the two gazed into each other's eyes without a\r\nword.  Cabot tried to speak, but something choked him so that he could\r\nnot; and, noting this, the other said gently:\r\n\r\n\"It is all over now, and you are as safe as though you stood on dry\r\nland; so don't try to say anything till we've made you comfortable, for\r\nI know you must have had an almighty hard time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" whispered Cabot.  \"I've been hungry, and thirsty, and wet, and\r\ncold, and scared; but now I'm only grateful--more grateful than I can\r\never tell.\"\r\n\r\nA little later the life raft, its mission accomplished, was left to\r\ntoss and drift at will, while the \"Sea Bee,\" with everything set and\r\ndrawing finely, was rapidly regaining her course, guided by the\r\nfar-reaching flash of Cape Race light.  In her dingy little cabin,\r\nwhich seemed to our rescued lad the most delightfully snug, warm, and\r\naltogether comfortable place he had ever entered, Cabot lay in the\r\nskipper's own bunk, regarding with intense interest the movements of\r\nthat busy youth.\r\n\r\nThe latter had lighted a swinging lamp, started a fire in a small and\r\nvery rusty galley stove, set a tea kettle on to boil, and a pan of cold\r\nchowder to re-warm.  Having thus got supper well under way, he returned\r\nto the cabin, where he proceeded to set the table.  The worst of\r\nCabot's distress had already been relieved by a cup of cold tea and a\r\nship's biscuit.  Now, finding that he was able to talk, his host could\r\nno longer restrain his curiosity, but began to ask questions.  He had\r\nalready learned Cabot's name, and told his own, which was Whiteway\r\nBaldwin, \"called White for short,\" he had added.  Now he said:\r\n\r\n\"You needn't talk, if you don't feel like it, but I do wish you could\r\ntell how you came to be drifting all alone on that raft.\"\r\n\r\n\"A steamer that I was on was wrecked yesterday, and so far as I know I\r\nam the only survivor,\" answered Cabot.\r\n\r\n\"Goodness!  You don't say so!  What steamer was she, where was she\r\nbound, and what part of the coast was she wrecked on?\"\r\n\r\n\"She was the 'Lavinia' from New York for St. Johns, and she wasn't\r\nwrecked on any part of the coast, but was lost at sea.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Jiminetty_!  The 'Lavinia'!  It don't seem possible.  How did it\r\nhappen?  There hasn't been any gale.  Did she blow up, or what?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" replied Cabot, \"for I was down-stairs when it took\r\nplace, and my stateroom door was jammed so that I couldn't get out for\r\na long time.  I only know that there was the most awful crash I ever\r\nheard, and it seemed as though the ship were being torn to pieces.\r\nThen there came an explosion, and when I got on deck the ship was\r\nsinking so fast that I had only time to cut loose the raft before she\r\nwent down.\"\r\n\r\n\"What became of the others?\" asked White excitedly.\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid they were drowned, for I heard them shouting just before\r\nshe sank, but there was such a cloud of steam, smoke, and fog that I\r\ncouldn't see a thing, and after it was all over I seemed to be the only\r\none left.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wasn't there a rock or ship or anything she might have run into?\"\r\nasked the young skipper, whose tanned face had grown pale as he\r\nlistened to this tale of sudden disaster.\r\n\r\n\"There was an iceberg,\" replied Cabot, \"but when I went down-stairs it\r\nwasn't very close, and the sun was shining, so that it was in plain\r\nsight.\"\r\n\r\n\"That must be what she struck, though,\" declared the other.  Then he\r\nthrust his head up the companionway and shouted: \"Hear the news, Dave.\r\nThe 'Lavinia's' lost with all on board, except the chap we've just\r\npicked up.\"\r\n\r\n\"What happened her?\" asked the man laconically.\r\n\r\n\"He says she ran into an iceberg in clear day, bust up, and sank with\r\nall hands, inside of a minute.\"\r\n\r\n\"Rot!\" replied the practical sailor.  \"The 'Laviny' had collision\r\nbulkheads, and couldn't have sunk in no sich time, ef she could at all.\r\n'Sides Cap'n Phinney ain't no man to run down a berg in clear day, nor\r\nyet in the night, nor no other time.  He's been on this coast and the\r\nLabrador run too long fur any sich foolishness.  No, son, ef the\r\n'Laviny's' lost, which mind, I don't say she ain't, she's lost some\r\nother way 'sides that, an' you can tell your friend so with my\r\ncompliments.\"\r\n\r\nCabot did not overhear these remarks, and wondered at the queer look on\r\nthe young skipper's face when he reëntered the cabin, as he did at the\r\nsilence with which the latter resumed his preparations for supper.  At\r\nthe same time he was still too weak, and, in spite of his biscuit, too\r\nravenously hungry to care for further conversation just then.  So it\r\nwas only after a most satisfactory meal and several cups of very hot\r\ntea that he was ready in his turn to ask questions.  But he was not\r\ngiven the chance; for, as soon as White Baldwin was through with\r\neating, he went on dock to relieve the tiller, and the other member of\r\nthe crew, whose name was David Gidge, came below.\r\n\r\nHe was a man of remarkable appearance, of very broad shoulders and long\r\narms; but with legs so bowed outward as to materially lower his\r\nstature, which would have been short at best, and convert his gait into\r\nan absurd waddle.  His face was disfigured by a scar across one cheek\r\nthat so drew that corner of his mouth downward as to produce a\r\npeculiarly forbidding expression.  He also wore a bristling iron-grey\r\nbeard that grew in form of a fringe or ruff, and added an air of\r\nferocity to his make up.\r\n\r\nAs this striking-looking individual entered the cabin and rolled into a\r\nseat at the table, he cast one glance, accompanied by a grunt, at\r\nCabot, and then proceeded to attend strictly to the business in hand.\r\nHe ate in such prodigious haste, and gulped his food in such vast\r\nmouthfuls, that he had cleaned the table of its last crumb, and was\r\nfiercely stuffing black tobacco into a still blacker pipe, before\r\nCabot, who really wished to talk with him, had decided how to open the\r\nconversation.  Lighting his pipe and puffing it into a ruddy glow, Mr.\r\nGidge made a waddling exit from the cabin, bestowing on our lad another\r\ngrunt as he passed him, and leaving an eddying wake of rank tobacco\r\nsmoke to mark his passage.\r\n\r\nFor some time after this episode Cabot struggled to keep awake in the\r\nhope that White would return and answer some of his questions; but\r\nfinally weariness overcame him, and he fell into a sleep that lasted\r\nwithout a break until after sunrise of the following morning.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the little schooner had held her course, and swept\r\nonward past the flashing beacons of Cape Race, Cape Pine, and Cape St.\r\nMary, until, at daylight, she was standing across the broad reach of\r\nPlacentia Bay towards the bald headland of Cape Chapeau Rouge.  She was\r\nmaking a fine run, and in spite of his weariness after a six hours'\r\nwatch on deck, White Baldwin presented a cheery face to Cabot, as the\r\nlatter vainly strove to recognise and account for his surroundings.\r\n\r\n\"Good morning,\" said the young skipper, \"I hope you have slept well,\r\nand are feeling all right again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, thank you,\" replied Cabot, suddenly remembering, \"I slept\r\nsplendidly, and am as fit as a fiddle.  Have we made a good run?\"\r\n\r\n\"Fine; we have come nearly a hundred miles from the place where we\r\npicked you up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we must be almost to St. Johns,\" suggested Cabot, tumbling from\r\nhis bunk as he spoke.  \"I am glad, for it is important that I should\r\nget there as quickly as possible.\"\r\n\r\n\"St. Johns!\" replied the other blankly.  \"Didn't you know that we had\r\ncome from St. Johns, and were going in the opposite direction?  Why, we\r\nare more than one hundred and fifty miles from there at this minute.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE FRENCH SHORE QUESTION.\r\n\r\nAlthough Cabot had had no reason to suppose that the \"Sea Bee\" was on\r\nher way to St. Johns, it had not for a moment occurred to him that she\r\ncould be going anywhere else.  Thus the news that they were not only a\r\nlong way from the place he wished to reach, but steadily increasing\r\ntheir distance from it, so surprised him that for a moment he sat on\r\nthe edge of his bunk gazing at the speaker as though doubting if he had\r\nheard aright.  Finally he asked: \"Where, then, are we bound?\"\r\n\r\n\"To Pretty Harbour, around on the west coast, where I live,\" was the\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\n\"I'd be willing to give you fifty dollars to turn around and carry me\r\nto St. Johns,\" said Cabot.\r\n\r\n\"Couldn't do it if you offered me a hundred, much as I need the money,\r\nand glad as I would be to oblige you, for I've got to get home in a\r\nhurry if I want to find any home to get to.  You see, it's this way,\"\r\ncontinued White, noting Cabot's look of inquiry, \"Pretty Harbour being\r\non the French shore----\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean by the French shore?\" interrupted Cabot.  \"I thought\r\nyou lived in Newfoundland, and that it was an English island.\"\r\n\r\n\"So it is,\" explained White; \"but, for some reason or other, I don't\r\nknow why, England made a treaty with France nearly two hundred years\r\nago, by which the French were granted fishing privileges from Cape Bay\r\nalong the whole west coast to Cape Bauld, and from there down the east\r\ncoast as far as Cape St. John.  By another treaty made some years\r\nafterwards France was granted, for her own exclusive use, the islands\r\nof Miquelon and St. Pierre, that lie just ahead of us now.\r\n\r\n\"In the meantime the French have been allowed to do pretty much as they\r\npleased with the west coast, until now they claim exclusive rights to\r\nits fisheries, and will hardly allow us natives to catch what we want\r\nfor our own use.  They send warships to enforce their demands, and\r\nthese compel us to sell bait to French fishermen at such price as they\r\nchoose to offer.  Why, I have seen men forced to sell bait to the\r\nFrench at thirty cents a barrel, when Canadian and American fishing\r\nboats wore offering five times that much for it.  At the same time the\r\nFrench officers forbid us to sell to any but Frenchmen, declaring that\r\nif we do they will not only prevent us from fishing, but will destroy\r\nour nets.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should think you would call on English warships for protection,\"\r\nsaid Cabot.  \"There surely must be some on this station.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied the other, bitterly, \"there are, but they always take\r\nthe part of the French, and do even more than they towards breaking up\r\nour business.\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\" cried Cabot.  \"British warships take part with the French\r\nagainst their own people!  That is one of the strangest things I ever\r\nheard of, and I can't understand it.  Is not this an English colony?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it is England's oldest colony; but, while I was born in it, and\r\nhave lived here all my life, I don't understand the situation any\r\nbetter than you.\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me,\" continued Cabot, \"that the conditions here must be\r\nfully as bad as those that led to the American Revolution, and I should\r\nthink you Newfoundlanders would rebel, and set up a government of your\r\nown, or join the United States, or do something of that kind.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps we would if we could,\" replied White; \"but our country is only\r\na poor little island, with a population of less than a quarter of a\r\nmillion.  If we should rebel, we would have to fight both England and\r\nFrance.  We should have to do it without help, too, for the United\r\nStates, which is the only country we desire to join, does not want us.\r\nSo you see there is nothing for us to do but accept the situation, and\r\nget along as best we can.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you emigrate to the States?\" suggested Cabot.\r\n\r\n\"Plenty of people whom I know have done so,\" replied the young\r\nNewfoundlander, \"and I might, too, if it were not for my mother and\r\nsister; but I don't know how I could make a living for them in the\r\nStates, or even for myself.  You see, everything we have in the world\r\nis tied up right here.  Besides, it would be hard to leave one's own\r\ncountry and go to live among strangers.  Don't you think so?\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you make a living here?\" asked Cabot, ignoring the last\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n\"We have made it until now by canning lobsters; but it looks as though\r\neven that business was to be stopped from this on.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?  Is it wrong to can lobsters?\"\r\n\r\n\"On the French shore, it seems to be one of the greatest crimes a\r\nperson can commit, worse even than smuggling, and the chief duty of\r\nBritish warships on this station is to break it up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that beats all!\" exclaimed Cabot.  \"Why is canning lobsters\r\nconsidered so wicked?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know that I can explain it very clearly,\" replied the young\r\nskipper of the \"Sea Bee,\" \"but, so far as I can make out, it is this\r\nway: You see, the west coast of Newfoundland is one of the best places\r\nin the world for lobsters.  So when the settlers there found they were\r\nnot allowed to make a living by fishing, they turned their attention to\r\ncatching and canning them.  They thought, of course, that in this they\r\nwould not be molested, since the French right was only to take and dry\r\nfish, which, in this country, means only codfish.  They were so\r\nsuccessful at the new business that after a while the French also began\r\nto establish lobster canneries.  As no one interfered with them they\r\nfinally became so bold as to order the closing of all factories except\r\ntheir own, and to actually destroy the property of such English\r\nsettlers as were engaged in the business.  Then there were riots, and\r\nwe colonists appealed to Parliament for protection in our rights.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course they granted it,\" said Cabot, who was greatly interested.\r\n\r\n\"Of course they did nothing of the kind,\" responded White, bitterly.\r\n\"The English authorities only remonstrated gently with the French, who\r\nby that time were claiming an exclusive right to all the business of\r\nthe west coast, and finally it was agreed to submit the whole question\r\nto arbitration.  It has never yet been arbitrated, though that was some\r\nyears ago.  In the meantime an arrangement was made by which all\r\nlobster factories in existence on July 1, 1889, were allowed to\r\ncontinue their business, but no others might be established.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was your factory one of those then in existence?\" asked Cabot.\r\n\r\n\"It was completed, and ready to begin work a whole month before that\r\ndate; but the captain of a French frigate told my father that if he\r\ncanned a single lobster his factory would be destroyed.  Father\r\nappealed to the commander of a British warship for protection; but was\r\ninformed that none could be given, and that if he persisted in the\r\nattempt to operate his factory his own countrymen would be compelled to\r\naid the French in its destruction.  On that, father went to law, but it\r\nwas not until the season was ended that the British captain was found\r\nto have had no authority for his action.  So father sued him for\r\ndamages, and obtained judgment for five thousand dollars.  He never got\r\nthe money, though, and by the time the next season came round the law\r\nregarding factories in existence on the first of the previous July was\r\nin force.  Then the question came up, whether or no our factory had\r\nbeen in existence at that time.  The French claim that it was not,\r\nbecause no work had been done in it, while we claim that, but for\r\nillegal interference, work would have been carried on for a full month\r\nbefore the fixed date.\"\r\n\r\n\"How was the question settled?\" asked Cabot.\r\n\r\n\"It was not settled until a few days ago, when a final decision was\r\nrendered against us, and now the property is liable to be destroyed at\r\nany minute.  Father fought the case until it worried him to death, and\r\nmother has been fighting it ever since.  All our property, except the\r\nfactory itself, this schooner, and a few hundred acres of worthless\r\nland, has gone to the lawyers.  While they have fought over the case, I\r\nhave made a sort of a living for the family by running the factory at\r\nodd times, when there was no warship at hand to prevent.  This season\r\npromises to be one of the best for lobsters ever known, and we had so\r\nnearly exhausted our supply of cans that I went to St. Johns for more.\r\nWhile there I got private information that the suit had gone against\r\nus, and that the commander of the warship 'Comattus,' then in port, had\r\nreceived orders to destroy our factory during his annual cruise along\r\nthe French shore.  The 'Comattus' was to start as soon as the 'Lavinia'\r\narrived.  The minute I heard this I set out in a hurry for home, in the\r\nhope of having time to pack the extra cases I have on board this\r\nschooner, and get them out of the way before the warship arrives.  That\r\nis one reason I am in such a hurry, and can't spare the time to take\r\nyou to St. Johns.  I wouldn't even have stopped long enough to\r\ninvestigate your raft if you had been a mile further off our course\r\nthan you were.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then all my yesterday's rowing didn't go for nothing,\" said Cabot.\r\n\r\n\"I should say not.  It was the one thing that saved you, so far as this\r\nschooner is concerned.  I'm in a hurry for another reason, too.  If the\r\nFrench get word that a decision has been rendered against us, and that\r\nthe factory is to be destroyed, they will pounce down on it in a jiffy,\r\nand carry away everything worth taking, to one of their own factories.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't wonder you are in a hurry,\" said Cabot.  \"I know I should be,\r\nin your place, and I don't blame you one bit for not wanting to take me\r\nback to St. Johns; but I wish you would tell me the next best way of\r\ngetting there.  You see, having lost everything in the way of an outfit\r\nit is necessary for me to procure a new one.  Besides that and the\r\nbusiness I have on hand, it seems to me that, as the only survivor of\r\nthe 'Lavinia,' I ought to report her loss as soon as possible.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" agreed White, \"of course you ought; though the longer it is\r\nunknown the longer the 'Comattus' will wait for her, and the more time\r\nI shall have.\"\r\n\r\n\"Provided some French ship doesn't get after you,\" suggested Cabot.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I realise that, and as I am going to stop at St. Pierre, to sec\r\nwhether the frigate 'Isla' is still in that harbour, I might set you\r\nashore there.  From St. Pierre you can get a steamer for St. Johns, and\r\neven if you have to wait a few days you could telegraph your news as\r\nquickly as you please.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" agreed Cabot.  \"I shall be sorry to leave you; but if that\r\nis the best plan you can think of I will accept it, and shall be\r\ngrateful if you will set me ashore as soon as possible.\"\r\n\r\nThus it was settled, and a few hours later the \"Sea Bee\" poked her nose\r\naround Gallantry Head, and ran into the picturesque, foreign-looking\r\nport of St. Pierre.  The French frigate \"Isla,\" that had more than once\r\nmade trouble for the Baldwins, lay in the little harbour, black and\r\nmenacing.  Hoping not to be recognized, White gave her as wide a berth\r\nas possible; but he had hardly dropped anchor when a boat--containing\r\nan officer, and manned by six sailors--shot out from her side, and was\r\npulled directly towards the schooner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nDEFYING A FRIGATE.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder what's up now?\" said White Baldwin, in a troubled tone, as he\r\nwatched the approaching man-of-war's boat.\r\n\r\n\"Mischief of some kind,\" growled David Gidge, as he spat fiercely into\r\nthe water.  \"I hain't never knowed a Frencher to be good fur nawthin'\r\nelse but mischief.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps it's a health officer,\" suggested Cabot.\r\n\r\n\"It's worse than that,\" replied White.\r\n\r\n\"A customs officer, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"He comes from the shore.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then perhaps it's an invitation for us to go and dine with the French\r\ncaptain?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've no doubt it's an invitation of some kind, and probably one that\r\nis meant to be accepted.\"\r\n\r\nAt this juncture the French boat dashed alongside, and, without leaving\r\nhis place, the lieutenant in command said in fair English:\r\n\r\n\"Is not zat ze boat of Monsieur Baldwin of Pretty Harbour on ze côte\r\nFrançaise?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is,\" replied the young skipper, curtly.\r\n\r\n\"You haf, of course, ze papaire of health, and ze papaire of clearance\r\nfor St. Pierre?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; I have no papers except a certificate of registry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!  Is it possible?  In zat case ze commandant of ze frigate 'Isla'\r\nwill be please to see you on board at your earlies' convenience.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought so,\" said White, in a low tone.  Then aloud, he replied:\r\n\"All right, lieutenant.  I'll sail over there, and hunt up a good place\r\nto anchor, just beyond your ship, and as soon as I've made all snug\r\nI'll come aboard.  Up with your mud hook, Dave.\"\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Gidge began to work the windlass, Cabot sprang to help him, and,\r\nwithin a minute, the recently dropped anchor was again broken out.\r\nThen, at a sharp order, David hoisted and trimmed the jib, leaving\r\nCabot to cat the anchor.  The fore and main sails had not been lowered.\r\nThus within two minutes' time the schooner was again under way, and\r\nstanding across the harbour towards the big warship.\r\n\r\nThe rapidity of these movements apparently somewhat bewildered the\r\nFrench officer, who, while narrowly watching them, did not utter a word\r\nof remonstrance.  Now, as the \"Sea Bee\" moved away, his boat was\r\nstarted in the same direction.\r\n\r\nWithout paying any further attention to it, White Baldwin luffed his\r\nlittle craft across the frigate's bow, and the moment he was hidden\r\nbeyond her, bore broad away, passing close along the opposite side of\r\nthe warship, from which hundreds of eyes watched his movements with\r\nlanguid curiosity.\r\n\r\nThe boat, in the meantime, had headed for the stern of the frigate,\r\nwith a view to gaining her starboard gangway, somewhere near which its\r\nofficer supposed White to be already anchoring.  What was his\r\namazement, therefore, as he drew within the shadow of his ship, to see\r\nthe schooner shoot clear of its further side, and go flying down the\r\nwind, lee rail under.  For a moment he looked to see her round to and\r\ncome to anchor.  Then, springing to his feet, he yelled for her to do\r\nso; upon which White Baldwin took off his cap, and made a mocking bow.\r\n\r\nAt this the enraged officer whipped out a revolver, and began to fire\r\nwildly in the direction of the vanishing schooner, which, for answer,\r\ndisplayed a British Union Jack at her main peak.  Three minutes later\r\nthe saucy craft had rounded a projecting headland and disappeared,\r\nleaving the outwitted officer to get aboard his ship at his leisure,\r\nand make such report as seemed to him best.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: At this the enraged officer whipped out a revolver.]\r\n\r\nAfter the exciting incident was ended, and the little \"Sea Bee\" had\r\ngained the safety of open water, Cabot grasped the young skipper's hand\r\nand shook it heartily.\r\n\r\n\"It was fine!\" he cried, \"though I don't see how you dared do it.\r\nWeren't you afraid they would fire at us?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a bit,\" laughed White.  \"They didn't realise what we were up to\r\nuntil we were well past them, and then they hadn't time to get ready\r\nbefore we were out of range.  I don't believe they would dare fire on\r\nthe British flag, anyway; especially as we hadn't done a thing to them.\r\nI almost wish they had, though; for I would be willing to lose this\r\nschooner and a good deal besides for the sake of bringing on a war that\r\nshould drive the French from Newfoundland.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what did they want of you, and what would have happened if you had\r\nnot given them the slip?\"\r\n\r\n\"I expect they wanted to hold me here until they heard how our case had\r\ngone, so that I couldn't get back to the factory before they had a\r\nchance to run up there and seize it.  Like as not they would have kept\r\nus on one excuse or another--lack of papers or something of that\r\nsort--for a week or two, and by the time they let us go some one else\r\nwould have owned the Pretty Harbour lobster factory.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would they really have dared do such a thing?\" asked Cabot, to whom\r\nthe idea of foreign interference in the local affairs of Newfoundland\r\nwas entirely new.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly they would.  The French dare do anything they choose on this\r\ncoast, and no one interferes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Cabot, \"it seems a very curious situation, and one that a\r\nstranger finds hard to understand.  However, so long as the French\r\npossess such a power for mischief, I congratulate you more than ever on\r\nhaving escaped them.  At the same time I am disappointed at not being\r\nable to land at St. Pierre, and should like to know where you are going\r\nto take me next.\"\r\n\r\n\"I declare!  In my hurry to get out of that trap, I forgot all about\r\nyou wanting to land,\" exclaimed White, \"and now there isn't a place\r\nfrom which you can get to St. Johns short of Port aux Basques, which is\r\nabout one hundred and fifty miles west of here.\"\r\n\r\n\"How may I reach St. Johns from there?\"\r\n\r\n\"By the railway across the island, of which Port aux Basques is the\r\nterminus.  A steamer from Sidney, on Cape Breton, connects with a train\r\nthere every other day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good; Port aux Basques it is,\" agreed Cabot, \"and I shan't be\r\nsorry after all for a chance to cross the island by train and see what\r\nits interior looks like.\"\r\n\r\nSo our young engineer continued his involuntary voyage, and devoted his\r\ntime to acquiring all sorts of information about the great northern\r\nisland, as well as to the study of navigation.  In this latter line of\r\nresearch he even succeeded in producing a favorable impression upon\r\nDavid Gidge, who finally admitted that it wasn't always safe to judge a\r\nman from his appearance, and that this young feller had more in him\r\nthan showed at first sight.\r\n\r\nWhile thus creating a favorable impression for himself, Cabot grew much\r\ninterested in the young skipper of the schooner.  He was surprised to\r\nfind one in his position so gentlemanly a chap, as well as so generally\r\nwell informed, and wondered where he had picked it all up.\r\n\r\n\"Are there good schools at Pretty Harbour?\" he asked, with a view to\r\nsolving this problem.\r\n\r\n\"There is one, but it is only fairly good,\" answered White.\r\n\r\n\"Did you go to it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no,\" laughed the other.  \"I went to school as well as to college\r\nin St. Johns.  You see, father was a merchant there until he bought a\r\ngreat tract of land on the west coast.  Then he gave up his business in\r\nthe city and came over here to establish a lobster factory, which at\r\nthat time promised to pay better than anything else on the island.  He\r\nleft us all in St. Johns, and it was only after his death that we came\r\nover here to live and try to save something from the wreck of his\r\nproperty.  Now I don't know what is to become of us; for, unless one is\r\nallowed to can lobsters, there isn't much chance of making a living on\r\nthe French shore.  If it wasn't for the others, I should take this\r\nschooner and try a trading trip to Labrador, but mother has become so\r\nmuch of an invalid that I hate to leave her with only my sister.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is your sister's name?\"\r\n\r\n\"Cola.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's an odd name, and one I never heard before, but I think I like\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"So do I,\" agreed White; \"though I expect I should like any name\r\nbelonging to her, for she is a dear girl.  One reason I am so fond of\r\nthis schooner is because it is named for her.\"\r\n\r\n\"How is that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, it is the 'Sea Bee,' and these are her initials.\"\r\n\r\nIt was early on the second morning after leaving St. Pierre that the\r\n\"Sea Bee\" drifted slowly into the harbour of Port aux Basques, where\r\nthe yacht-like steamer \"Bruce\" lay beside its single wharf.  She had\r\njust completed her six-hour run across Cabot Strait, from North Sidney,\r\neighty-five miles away, and close at hand stood the narrow-gauge train\r\nthat was to carry her passengers and mails to St. Johns.  It would\r\noccupy twenty-eight hours in making the run of 550 miles from coast to\r\ncoast, and our lad looked forward to the trip with pleasant\r\nanticipations.\r\n\r\nBut he was again doomed to disappointment; for while the schooner was\r\nstill at some distance from the wharf, the train was seen to be in\r\nmotion.  In vain did Cabot shout and wave his cap.  No attention was\r\npaid to his signals, and a minute later the train had disappeared.\r\nThere would not be another for two days, and the young engineer gazed\r\nabout him with dismay.  Port aux Basques appeared to be only a railway\r\nterminus, offering no accommodation for travellers, and presenting,\r\nwith its desolate surroundings, a scene of cheerless inhospitality.\r\n\r\n\"That's what I call tough luck!\" exclaimed White Baldwin,\r\nsympathetically.\r\n\r\n\"Isn't it?\" responded Cabot; \"and what I am to do with myself in this\r\ndreary place after you are gone, I can't imagine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Seems to me you'd better stay right where you are, and run up the\r\ncoast with us to St. George's Bay, where there is another station at\r\nwhich you can take the next train.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should like to,\" replied Cabot, \"if you would allow me to pay for my\r\npassage; but I don't want to impose upon your hospitality any longer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense!\" exclaimed White.  \"You are already doing your full share of\r\nthe work aboard here, and even if you weren't of any help, I should be\r\nonly too happy to have you stay with us until the end of the run, for\r\nthe pleasure of your company.\"\r\n\r\n\"That settles it,\" laughed Cabot.  \"I will go with you as far as St.\r\nGeorge's, and be glad of the chance.  But, while we are here, I think I\r\nought to send in the news about the 'Lavinia.'\"\r\n\r\nAs White agreed that this should be done at once, Cabot was set ashore,\r\nand made his way to the railway telegraph office, where he asked the\r\noperator to whom in St. Johns he should send the news of a wreck.\r\n\r\n\"What wreck?\" asked the operator.\r\n\r\n\"Steamer 'Lavinia.'\"\r\n\r\n\"There's no need to send that to anybody, for it's old news, and went\r\nthrough here last night as a press despatch.  'Lavinia' went too close\r\nto an iceberg, that capsized, and struck her with long, under-water\r\nprojection.  Lifted steamer from water, broke her back, boiler\r\nexploded, and that was the end of 'Lavinia.'  Mate's boat reached St.\r\nJohns, and 'Comattus' has gone to look for other possible survivors.\"\r\n\r\nAs Cabot had nothing to add to this story, he merely sent a short\r\ndespatch to Mr. Hepburn, announcing his own safety, and then returned\r\nto the schooner with his news.\r\n\r\n\"Good!\" exclaimed White, when he heard it.  \"I hope the 'Comattus' will\r\nfind those she has gone to look for; and I'm mighty glad she has got\r\nsomething to do that will keep her away from here for a few days\r\nlonger.  Now, Dave, up with the jib.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nA CLASSMATE TO BE AVOIDED.\r\n\r\nCabot had been impressed by the rugged scenery of the Nova Scotia shore\r\nline, but it had been tame as compared with the stern grandeur of that\r\nunfolded when the \"Sea Bee\" rounded Cape Ray and was headed up the west\r\ncoast of Newfoundland.  He had caught glimpses of lofty promontories\r\nand precipitous cliffs as the schooner skirted the southern end of the\r\nisland; but most of the time it had kept too far from shore for him to\r\nappreciate the marvellous details.  Now, however, as they beat up\r\nagainst a head wind, they occasionally ran in so close as to be wet by\r\ndrifting spray from the roaring breakers that ceaselessly dashed\r\nagainst the mighty wall, rising, grim and sheer, hundreds of feet above\r\nthem.  Everywhere the rock was stained a deep red, indicating the\r\npresence of iron, and everywhere it had been rent or shattered into a\r\nthousand fantastic forms.  At short intervals the massive cliffs were\r\nwrenched apart to make room for narrow fiords, of unknown depth, that\r\npenetrated for miles into the land, where they formed intricate mazes\r\nof placid waterways.  Beside them there were nestled tiny fishing\r\nvillages of whitewashed houses, though quite as often these were\r\nperched on apparently inaccessible crags, overlooking sheltered coves\r\nof the outer coast.\r\n\r\nOn the tossing waters fronting them, fleets of fishing boats, with\r\nsails tanned a ruddy brown, like those of the \"Sea Bee,\" or blackened\r\nby coal tar, darted with the grace and fearlessness of gulls, or rested\r\nas easily on the heaving surface, while the fishermen, clad in yellow\r\noilskins, pursued their arduous toil.\r\n\r\nTo our young American the doings of these hardy seafarers proved so\r\ninteresting that he never tired of watching them nor of asking\r\nquestions concerning their perilous occupation.  And he had plenty of\r\ntime in which to acquire information, for so adverse were the winds\r\nthat only by the utmost exertion did White Baldwin succeed in getting\r\nhis schooner to the St. George's landing in time for Cabot to run to\r\nthe railway station just as the train from Port aux Basques was coming\r\nin.\r\n\r\nThe two lads exchanged farewells with sincere regrets, after White had\r\nextended a most cordial invitation to the other to finish the cruise\r\nwith him, and visit his home at Pretty Harbour.  Much as Cabot wished\r\nto accept this invitation, he had declined it for the present, on the\r\nplea that he ought first to go to St. Johns.  At the same time he had\r\npromised to try and make the proposed visit before leaving the island,\r\nto which White had replied:\r\n\r\n\"Don't delay too long, then, or you may not find us at home, for there\r\nis no knowing what may happen when the warships get there.\"\r\n\r\nEven David Gidge shook hands with the departing guest, and said it was\r\na pity he couldn't stay with them a while longer, seeing that he might\r\nbe made into a very fair sort of a sailor with proper training.\r\n\r\nWith one regretful backward glance, Cabot left the little schooner on\r\nwhich he had come to feel so much at home, and sprinted towards the\r\nstation, where was gathered half the population of the village--men,\r\nwomen, children, and dogs.  The train was already at the platform as he\r\nmade his way through this crowd, wondering if he had time to purchase a\r\nticket, and he glanced at it curiously.  It was well filled, and heads\r\nwere thrust from most of the car windows on that side.  Through one\r\nwindow Cabot saw a quartette of men too busily engaged over a game of\r\ncards to take note of their surroundings.  As our lad's gaze fell on\r\nthese, he suddenly stood still and stared.  Then he turned, pushed out\r\nfrom the crowd, and made his way back towards the landing as rapidly as\r\nhe had come from it a few minutes before.\r\n\r\nThe \"Sea Bee\" was under way, but had not got beyond hail, and was put\r\nback when her crew discovered who was signalling them so vigorously.\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter?\" inquired her young skipper, as Cabot again\r\nclambered aboard.  \"Did you miss the train after all?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied Cabot.  \"I could have caught it; but made up my mind at\r\nthe last moment that I might just as well go with you to Pretty Harbour\r\nnow as to try and visit it later.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good!\" cried White, heartily.  \"I am awfully glad you did.  We were\r\nfeeling blue enough without you, weren't we, Dave?\"\r\n\r\n\"Blue warn't no name for it,\" replied Mr. Gidge.  \"It were worse than a\r\ndrop in the price of fish; an' now I feel as if they'd riz a dollar a\r\nkental.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you both,\" laughed Cabot.  \"I hadn't any idea how much I should\r\nhate to leave the old 'Bee' until I tried to do it.  You said there was\r\nanother station that I could reach from your place, didn't you?\" he\r\nadded, turning to White.\r\n\r\n\"Yes.  There is one at Bay of Islands that can be reached by a drive of\r\na few hours from Pretty Harbour; and I'll carry you over there any time\r\nyou like,\" replied the latter.\r\n\r\n\"That settles it, then; and I'll let St. Johns wait a few days longer.\"\r\n\r\nSo the little schooner was again headed seaward, and set forth at a\r\nnimble pace for her run around Cape St. George and up the coast past\r\nPort au Port to the exquisitely beautiful Bay of Islands, on which\r\nPretty Harbour is located; and, as she bore him away, Cabot hoped he\r\nhad done the right thing.\r\n\r\nWhen commissioned to undertake this journey that was proving so full of\r\nincident, our young engineer had been only too glad of an excuse to\r\nbreak his engagement with Thorpe Walling; for, as has been said, the\r\nlatter was not a person whom he particularly liked.  Walling, on the\r\nother hand, had boasted that the most popular fellow in the Institute\r\nhad chosen above all things to take a trip around the world in his\r\ncompany, and was greatly put out by the receipt of Cabot's telegram\r\nannouncing his change of plan.  The more Thorpe reflected upon this\r\ngrievance the more angry did he become, until he finally swore enmity\r\nagainst Cabot Grant, and to get even with him if ever he had the chance.\r\n\r\nHe was provoked that his chosen companion should have dismissed him so\r\ncurtly, without any intimation of what he proposed to do, and this he\r\ndetermined to discover.  So he went to New York and made inquiries at\r\nthe offices of the company acting as Cabot's guardian; but could only\r\nlearn that the young man had left the city after two private interviews\r\nwith President Hepburn.  At the club where Cabot had lunched on the day\r\nof his departure, Thorpe's appearance created surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Thought you had started off with Grant on a trip around the world?\"\r\nsaid one member in greeting him.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied Walling; \"we are not going.\"\r\n\r\n\"But he sailed two days ago.  At least, he said that was what he was\r\nabout to do when he bade me good-bye on his way to the steamer.\"\r\n\r\n\"What steamer, and where was she bound?\" asked Thorpe.\r\n\r\n\"Don't know.  He only said he was about to sail.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll not be beaten that way,\" thought Walling, angrily; and, having\r\nplenty of money to expend as best suited him, he straightway engaged\r\nthe services of a private detective.  This man was instructed to\r\nascertain for what port a certain Cabot Grant had sailed from New York\r\ntwo days earlier, and that very evening the coveted information was in\r\nhis possession.\r\n\r\n\"Sailed on the 'Lavinia' for St. Johns, Newfoundland, has he?\" muttered\r\nThorpe.  \"Then I, too, will visit St. Johns, and discover what he is\r\ndoing.  I might as well go there as anywhere else; and perhaps Grant\r\nwill find out that it would have been wiser to confide in an old friend\r\nthan to treat him as shabbily as he has me.\"\r\n\r\nHaving reached this decision, Walling took a train from New York, and,\r\ntravelling by way of Boston, Portland, and Bangor, crossed the St.\r\nCroix River from Maine into New Brunswick at Vanceboro.  From there he\r\nwent, via St. John, N.B., and Truro, Nova Scotia, to Port Mulgrave,\r\nwhere he passed over the Strait of Canso to Cape Breton.  Across that\r\nisland his route lay through the Bras d'Or country to North Sidney, at\r\nwhich point he took steamer for Port aux Basques and the Newfoundland\r\nrailway that should finally land him in St. Johns.  On this journey he\r\nbecame acquainted with several Americans, with whom he played whist,\r\nwhich is what he was doing when his train pulled up at the St. George's\r\nBay platform.\r\n\r\nAt sight of his classmate, Cabot became instantly desirious of avoiding\r\nhim and the embarrassing questions he would be certain to ask.\r\nAlthough our young engineer could not imagine why Thorpe Walling had\r\ncome to Newfoundland, he instinctively felt that the visit had\r\nsomething to do with his own trip to the island.  He knew that Thorpe\r\ndelighted to pry into the secrets of others; and also that he was of a\r\nvindictive nature, quick to take offence, and unscrupulous in his\r\nenmities.  Therefore, as his instructions permitted him to visit\r\nwhatever part of Newfoundland he chose, he decided to avoid St. Johns\r\nfor the present rather than risk the results of a companionship that\r\nnow seemed so undesirable.\r\n\r\nSomewhat earlier on that same day one of Thorpe's travelling\r\ncompanions, named Gregg, spoke to him of Newfoundland's mineral wealth,\r\nand referred particularly to the Bell Island iron mines.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Walling, who had never before heard of Bell Island,\r\n\"they must be immensely valuable.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I don't know,\" said the other, carelessly.  \"Several American\r\ncompanies are trying to get control of them; but perhaps they are not\r\nwhat they are cracked up to be after all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Isn't a New York man by the name of Hepburn one of the interested\r\nparties?\" asked Thorpe, at a venture.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, he is,\" responded Mr. Gregg, turning on him sharply.  \"Why, do\r\nyou know him?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't say that I know him; but I know a good deal about him, and\r\nhave every reason to believe that he has just sent an acquaintance of\r\nmine, a young mining engineer, up here to examine that very property.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is he an expert?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes.  He and I were classmates at a technical institute.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you also are a mining engineer?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you come to Newfoundland to investigate mineral lands?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not exactly; though I may do something in that line if I find a good\r\nopening.  At present I am merely on a pleasure trip.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see, and I am glad to have made your acquaintance, as I am somewhat\r\ninterested in mineral lands myself.  When we reach St. Johns I hope you\r\nwill introduce me to your friend, and it may happen that I can return\r\nthe favour by putting you on to a good thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, I will introduce you if we run across him,\" replied Thorpe.\r\n\"At the same time I hope you won't mention having any knowledge of his\r\nbusiness, as he is trying to keep it quiet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Like most of us who have 'deals' on hand,\" remarked the other, with a\r\nmeaning smile.  \"But it is hard to hide them from clever chaps like\r\nyourself.\"\r\n\r\nAt which compliment, Thorpe, who had only been making some shrewd\r\nguesses, looked wise, but said nothing.\r\n\r\nIt happened that these two were playing whist when the train reached\r\nSt. George's Bay, and Mr. Gregg remarked to his partner:\r\n\r\n\"There's a chap staring at this crowd as if he knew some of us.\"\r\n\r\nThorpe glanced from the window, and started from his seat with an\r\nexclamation.  At the same moment Cabot Grant turned away and hurried\r\nfrom the station.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know him?\" asked Mr. Gregg.\r\n\r\n\"He is the very person I was speaking to you about a while ago,\"\r\nreplied Thorpe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nSENDING IN A FALSE REPORT.\r\n\r\nAt sight of Cabot, Thorpe Walling's instinct had been to leave the car\r\nand follow him; but the thought of his luggage, which he knew he could\r\nnot get off in time, caused him to hesitate, and then it was too late,\r\nfor the train was again in motion.\r\n\r\n\"The young man did not seem particularly anxious to meet his old\r\nclassmate,\" remarked Mr. Gregg.  \"In fact, it rather looked as though\r\nhe wished to avoid recognition.\"\r\n\r\nThorpe pretended to be too busy with his cards to make reply to this\r\nsuggestion; but an ugly expression came into his face, and, from that\r\nmoment, he hated Cabot Grant.  When, on the following day, he reached\r\nSt. Johns and learned of the loss of the \"Lavinia,\" with all on board,\r\nexcept those saved in the mate's boat, he was more perplexed than ever.\r\nCabot's name was published as one of those who had gone down with the\r\nill-fated steamer, and yet he had certainly seen him alive and well\r\nonly the day before.  What could it mean?\r\n\r\n\"Do you suppose Hepburn knows of his escape?\" asked Mr. Gregg, who was\r\nstopping at the same hotel, and to whom Thorpe confided this mystery.\r\n\r\n\"I haven't an idea.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you say to wiring and finding out?  It can't do us any harm,\r\nand might gain us an insight into the old man's plans up here.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should say it was a good idea.\"\r\n\r\nAs a result of this desire for information the following telegram was\r\nsent to the president of the Gotham Trust and Investment Company:\r\n\r\n\"St. Johns, N'f'l'd.--Here all right.  What shall I do next?----C. G.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd the answer came promptly:\r\n\r\n\"Congratulations.  Send B. I. report.  If in need of funds, draw.----H.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"That settles it!\" exclaimed Mr. Gregg, exultingly.  \"Hepburn is after\r\nBell Island, and your friend was sent here to report upon its value.\r\nNow, it will be a pity if the old man doesn't get his information,\r\nwhich he isn't likely to do for some time with that young chap over on\r\nthe west coast.  Some one ought to send him a report.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have a mind to do it myself,\" said Thorpe, reflectively.\r\n\r\n\"It would be an awfully decent thing for you to do.  Be a good joke on\r\nyour friend, too, and make him fed ashamed of himself for cutting you\r\nso dead yesterday, when he finds it out.  He is bound to get into\r\ntrouble if some sort of a report isn't sent in, now that he is known to\r\nhave escaped from the wreck.\"\r\n\r\n\"Confound him!\" exclaimed Thorpe.  \"I don't care how soon he gets into\r\ntrouble; nor how much.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, come.  That isn't a nice way to speak of an old friend and\r\nclassmate,\" remarked Mr. Gregg, reprovingly.  \"Now, I always feel sorry\r\nwhen I see a decent young chap like that throwing away a good chance,\r\nand want to help him if I can.  So in the present case, I think we\r\nreally ought to send in a report that will satisfy old Hepburn, and\r\nkeep the boy solid with his employers.  I shouldn't know how to word it\r\nmyself, but if you, with your expert knowledge of the subject, will\r\nmake it out, of course after taking a look at the mine, I'll see that\r\nyou don't lose anything by your kindness.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" replied Thorpe, who was quite sharp enough to comprehend\r\nthe other's meaning.  \"I'll do it.\"\r\n\r\nSo the two conspirators drove to the picturesque fishing village of\r\nPortugal Cove, where they hired a boat to carry them across to Bell\r\nIsland.  There they paid a hasty visit to the mine, which Mr. Gregg\r\nplausibly belittled and undervalued, until Thorpe really began to\r\nconsider it a greatly overestimated piece of property, and this idea he\r\nembodied in a report that he wrote out that very evening.\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad to see that you think as I do concerning the real\r\nworthlessness of Bell Island,\" remarked Mr. Gregg, gravely, as he\r\nglanced over the paper, \"and the man who would have anything to do with\r\nit after reading this must be a greater fool than I take old Hepburn to\r\nbe.\"\r\n\r\nOn the following day a type-written copy of Thorpe's report was made,\r\nsigned \"C. G.,\" and forwarded by mail to the president of the Gotham\r\nTrust and Investment Company.  As a result, a telegram was received a\r\nweek later at the Bank of Nova Scotia in St. Johns addressed to Cabot\r\nGrant, and desiring him to return at once to New York.  As the bank\r\npeople wired back that they had no knowledge of any such person, Mr.\r\nHepburn in reply requested them to keep a sharp lookout for a young man\r\nof that name, who would shortly present a letter of credit to them, and\r\nprovide him with a ticket to New York on account of it, but nothing\r\nmore.  Mr. Hepburn also explained that, as Cabot Grant's guardian, he\r\nhad the right to thus limit his ward's expenditures.\r\n\r\nThus our lad fell into disgrace with his employer, who knew, as well as\r\nany man living, the exact status of the Bell Island iron mine, and had\r\nonly requested Cabot to report on it in order to test his fitness for\r\nother work.\r\n\r\nWhile the correspondence with the bank was being carried on, Messrs.\r\nWalling and Gregg watched for the arrival of the young engineer, whom\r\nthey expected by every train.  They also anxiously awaited the news\r\nthat the Hepburn syndicate had withdrawn its offer for the Bell Island\r\nproperty, in which event it would fall, at a greatly reduced price, to\r\nthe company represented by Mr. Gregg.\r\n\r\nTotally unconscious of all this, Cabot Grant was at that very time in a\r\nremote corner of the west coast, happily engaged in aiding certain of\r\nits inhabitants to discomfit the combined naval forces of two of the\r\nmost powerful governments of the world.  Moreover, he had become so\r\ninterested in this exciting occupation, as well as in certain\r\ndiscoveries that he was making, as to have very nearly lost sight of\r\nhis intention to visit the capital of the island.\r\n\r\nWhen he reëmbarked on the \"Sea Bee\" at St. George's Bay, he fully\r\nintended to catch the train of two days later at the station to which\r\nWhite had promised to convey him.  He was glad of a chance to view some\r\nmore of that magnificent west coast scenery, and when the little\r\nschooner finally rounded South Head, and was pointed towards the\r\nmassive front of Blomidon, which David Gidge called \"Blow-me-down,\" he\r\nfelt well repaid for his delay by the enchanting beauty of the Bay of\r\nIslands that lay outspread before them.\r\n\r\nSoon after passing South Head, the \"Sea Bee,\" with flags flying from\r\nboth masts, slipped through a narrow passage into the land-locked basin\r\nof Pretty Harbour.  On its further shore stood a handful of white\r\nhouses, and a larger building that fronted the water.\r\n\r\n\"That's our factory!\" cried White, \"and there is our house, on the\r\nhillside, just beyond.  See, the one with the dormer windows.  There's\r\nCola waving from one of them now.  Bless her!  She must have been\r\nwatching, to sight us so quickly.  Oh, I can't wait.  Dave, you take\r\nthe 'Bee' up to the wharf.  Mr. Grant will help you, I know, as well as\r\nexcuse me if I go ashore first.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course, I will,\" replied Cabot; and in another minute the young\r\nskipper was sculling ashore in the dinghy, while the schooner drifted\r\nmore slowly in the same direction.\r\n\r\nWhen they finally reached the factory wharf White was on hand to meet\r\nthem, and beside him stood the slender, merry-eyed girl for whom the\r\nschooner had been named.  She unaffectedly held out a hand to Cabot\r\nwhen they were introduced, and at once invited him to the house to meet\r\nher mother.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said White, \"you two go along, and don't wait for me.  You see,\"\r\nhe added, apologetically, to Cabot, \"there's been a great catch of\r\nlobsters, and if I can only get them packed before we are interfered\r\nwith, we'll make a pretty good season of it, after all.\"\r\n\r\nSo the new-comer walked with Cola up the straggling village street,\r\npast a score of fisher cottages, each with a tiny porch, pots of\r\nflowers in the front windows, and a bit of a garden fenced with\r\nwattles, to keep out the children, goats, dogs, and pigs, that swarmed\r\non all sides.  At length they came to the neatly kept and\r\ncomfortable-looking house, overlooking the whole, that White Baldwin\r\ncalled home.  Here Cabot was presented to the sweet-faced invalid\r\nmother, who sat beside a window of the living-room, from which she\r\ncould look out on the little harbour, and who was eager to learn the\r\ndetails of his recent experiences that White had only found time to\r\noutline to her.\r\n\r\nBoth mother and daughter listened with deepest interest while Cabot\r\ntold of the loss of the \"Lavinia,\" and when he had finished Mrs.\r\nBaldwin said:\r\n\r\n\"You certainly made a wonderful escape, and I am grateful that my boy\r\nwas granted the privilege of rescuing you from that dreadful raft.  I\r\nam confident, also, that you have been brought to this place for some\r\nwise purpose, and trust that you are planning to remain with us as long\r\nas your engagements will permit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, madam,\" replied Cabot.  \"I wish I might accept your\r\nhospitality for a week, at least.  For I am certain I should find much\r\nto enjoy in this delightful region.  I feel, however, that I ought to\r\ncatch to-morrow's train, as it is rather necessary for me to reach St.\r\nJohns without further delay.\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems queer,\" remarked Cola, \"that this stupid place can strike\r\neven a stranger as being delightful, since there is no one to see but\r\nfisherfolk, who can talk of nothing but fish, and there isn't a thing\r\nto do but watch the boats go and come.  For my part, I am so tired of\r\nit all that I wish something would happen to send us away from here\r\nforever.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear!\" said Mrs. Baldwin to Cola, reprovingly.\r\n\r\n\"Some one seems to have found an occupation here in collecting a\r\ncabinet of specimens,\" suggested Cabot, indicating, as he spoke, some\r\nshelves covered with bits of rock, that had attracted his attention.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" admitted Cola, \"I have found some amusement in gathering those\r\nthings; but I don't know what half of them are, and there is no one\r\nhere to tell me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Possibly I might help you to name some of them,\" said Cabot, \"as I\r\nhave a bowing acquaintance with geology.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! can you?\" cried the girl.  \"Then I wish you would, right away, for\r\nI am almost certain that several of them contain minerals, and I want\r\nawfully to know if they are gold.\"\r\n\r\nThe next moment the two young people were standing before the cabinet,\r\ndeep in the mysteries of periods, ages, formations, series, and other\r\nprofound geologic terms.  All at once Cabot paused, and, holding a bit\r\nof serpentine in his hand, asked:\r\n\r\n\"Did this come from about here?\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"Did this come from about here?\"]\r\n\r\n\"Yes; ail of them did.\"\r\n\r\n\"Could you show me the place, or somewhere near where you found it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I could, if we had time; but not if you are going away in the\r\nmorning, for it would take at least half a day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Cabot, \"I believe I might wait over long enough for that,\r\nand guess I won't start for St. Johns to-morrow, after all.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nCABOT ACQUIRES A LOBSTER FACTORY.\r\n\r\nThe Baldwins were greatly pleased at Cabot's decision to wait over a\r\ntrain; for, as Mrs. Baldwin said, a desirable guest in that\r\nout-of-the-way corner of the world was the greatest of luxuries.  White\r\nwas glad to prolong the friendship so strangely begun, and also to\r\nescape a present necessity for leaving his work to carry Cabot to the\r\ndistant railway station, while Cola was delighted to have found what\r\nshe termed a geologic companion.  After it was arranged that these two\r\nshould set forth early the following day on a search for specimens,\r\nCabot strolled down to the factory to learn something of the process of\r\ncanning lobsters.\r\n\r\nHe was amazed at the change effected in so short a time.  When he\r\nlanded at Pretty Harbour the factory had been closed, silent, and\r\ndeserted.  Now it was a hive of bustling activity, in which every\r\navailable person of the village, including women and children, was hard\r\nat work.  Fires were blazing under a number of great kettles half\r\nfilled with boiling water.  Into these, green lobsters were tossed by\r\nbarrowfuls, to be taken out a little later smoking hot and coloured a\r\nvivid scarlet.  On the packing tables their shells were broken, and the\r\nextracted meat was put into cans, to which covers, each with a tiny\r\nhole in the middle, were soldered.  Then the filled cans were steamed,\r\nby trayfuls, to exhaust their air; a drop of solder closed each vent,\r\nand they were ready for labelling and packing in cases.  White Baldwin,\r\nin person, superintended all these operations, while David Gidge saw to\r\nthe unloading of the \"Sea Bee,\" and kept sharp watch on a gang of\r\nshouting urchins, who were withdrawing the live lobsters from the\r\noutside salt-water pens, in which they had been kept while awaiting\r\ntheir fate.\r\n\r\nWhite was in high spirits, for the travelling agent of a St. Johns\r\nbusiness house had just offered a good cash price for his entire pack.\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" the young proprietor said to Cabot, as they viewed the\r\nbusy scone, \"we won't make anything like what we would if we were\r\nallowed a whole uninterrupted season; but, if they will only let us\r\nalone for a week, I'll pack a thousand cases.  Those will yield enough\r\nto support us for a year, and before that is up I'm not afraid but that\r\nI'll find some other way of earning a living.  Now, if I can only get\r\nsufficient help, I'm going to run this factory night and day for the\r\nnext week, unless compelled by force to stop sooner.\"\r\n\r\nCabot was already so interested that he promptly volunteered to aid in\r\nmaking the all-important pack.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know anything about the business,\" he said, \"but if you can\r\nmake use of me in any way, I shall be only too glad of a chance to\r\nrepay a small portion of the great debt I owe you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense!\" laughed White.  \"You don't owe me a thing, and I don't want\r\nyou to feel that way.  At the same time I should be ever so glad of\r\nyour help in getting things well started; for just now one strong\r\nfellow like you would be worth a dozen of those children.\"\r\n\r\nSo, a few minutes later, Cabot, clad in overalls and an old flannel\r\nshirt of White's, was as hard at work as though the canning of lobsters\r\nwas the business of his life.  Far into the night he laboured, only\r\npausing long enough to go up to the house for supper; and, on the\r\nfollowing morning, he was actually pleased that a heavy rain storm\r\nshould postpone the trip for specimens, furnish him with an excuse for\r\nprolonging his stay, and leave him at liberty to resume his\r\nself-imposed task in the factory.\r\n\r\nThe storm lasted for two days, at the end of which time half the pack\r\nhad been made, and Cabot had become so familiar with all details of the\r\nwork as to be a most valuable assistant.  On the third day, the supply\r\nof lobsters on hand being exhausted, operations were suspended until\r\nthe boats could return with a new catch; and, as the weather was again\r\nfine, Cabot and Cola set forth on their geological exploration.\r\n\r\nIt was a glorious day, with a sky of deepest blue; the hot sunshine\r\ntempered by a cool breeze pouring in from the sea, and all nature\r\nsparkling with joyous life.  To Cabot, who had thought of Newfoundland\r\nas a place of perpetual fog, and almost constant rain, the whole scene\r\nwas a source of boundless delight.  As the two young people climbed the\r\nsteep ascent behind the village, new beauties were unfolded with each\r\nmoment, until, when they reached the crest, and could look far out over\r\nthe islanded bay, with the placid cove and its white hamlet nestling at\r\ntheir feet, Cabot declared his belief that there was not a more\r\nexquisite view in all the world.\r\n\r\nAfter gazing their fill, the explorers plunged into a sweet-scented\r\nforest of spruce and birches, threaded by narrow wood roads, and\r\ntramped for miles, stopping now and then to examine some outcropping\r\nledge or gather a handful of snow-white capilear berries.  But the main\r\nobject of their quest, the copper-bearing serpentine, was not found\r\nuntil they had gained the summit of the Blomidon range and were in full\r\nview of the sea.  Then they came to a distinct outcrop of\r\nmineral-bearing rock that caused the eyes of the young geologist to\r\nglisten with anticipation.\r\n\r\nWhile he chipped off specimens, studied the trend of the ledge, and\r\nmade such estimates of its character as were possible from surface\r\nindications, his companion climbed a rocky eminence that, short of\r\nBlomidon itself, commanded the most extended view of any in that\r\nregion.  She had hardly gained the summit when she uttered a cry that\r\nattracted Cabot's attention and caused him to hasten in her direction.\r\nIn a few moments he met her running breathlessly down the hill.\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" he asked.  \"Are you hurt?\"\r\n\r\n\"A warship coming up the coast,\" she panted.  \"I saw it plainly, and we\r\nmust get back with the news as quick as we can.\"\r\n\r\nMuch as Cabot hated to give over the exploration of that wonderful\r\ncopper-bearing ledge, he did not hesitate to obey the imperative call\r\nof friendship, and accompanied Cola with all speed back to the village.\r\nWhen they reached it they found White jubilant over the extraordinary\r\ncatch of lobsters that was even then being brought in.\r\n\r\n\"Hurrah!\" he cried, as Cabot appeared.  \"Biggest catch of the season,\r\nand you are just in time to help pack it away.  But what brings you\r\nback so early?  I thought you were off for all day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, White, they are coming!\" gasped Cola.\r\n\r\n\"Who are coming?\"\r\n\r\n\"A warship.  I saw it from Maintop.\"\r\n\r\n\"British or French?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know.  I only knew it was a warship because it was so much\r\nbigger than the 'Harlaw' and had tall masts.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it don't make any difference,\" growled White, \"one is just as\r\nbad as another, and our business is ruined anyway.  Why couldn't they\r\nhave kept away for three days longer?\"\r\n\r\n\"What will they do?\" inquired Cabot, curiously.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" replied White, bitterly.  \"Either destroy or seize the\r\nwhole plant and leave us to starve at our leisure.  Now, I suppose we\r\nmight as well go up to the house and tell mother.  There's no use doing\r\nany more work under the circumstances.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't see why not,\" objected Cabot, who was not accustomed to\r\nthrowing up a fight before it was begun.  \"There is a possibility that\r\nthe vessel may not be a warship after all, and another that she is not\r\ncoming to this place.  Even if she does, you don't know that she has\r\nany warrant for interfering with your business.  So, if I were you, I'd\r\ngo right on with the work and keep at it until some one compelled me to\r\nstop.  I say, though, speaking of warrants gives me an idea.  All you\r\nwant is three days' delay, isn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is what I want most just now,\" replied White.\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, why not place this property in the name of some\r\nfriend--David Gidge, for instance--and when those men-of-war people\r\nbegin to make trouble let him ask them whose factory it is they are\r\nafter.  They will say yours, or your mother's, of course.  Then he'll\r\nspeak up and say in that case they've come to the wrong place, since\r\nthis is the property of Mr. David Gidge, while their warrant only\r\nmentions that of Mrs. Whiteway Baldwin.  It'll be a big bluff, of\r\ncourse, and won't work for very long, but it may puzzle 'em a bit and\r\ngive the delay of proceedings that you require.\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe you are right about keeping on with the work,\" replied\r\nWhite, thoughtfully; \"though I am not so sure about the other part of\r\nyour scheme.  Anyway, I must run to the house for a little talk with\r\nmother, and if you'll just set things going in the factory I shall be\r\nmuch obliged.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" agreed Cabot, \"I'll shake 'em up.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he was as good as his word, for when, after an absence of more than\r\nan hour, White reappeared on the scene he found the factory in full\r\nblast, with its operatives working as they had never worked before, and\r\nCabot Grant, the most disreputable-looking of the lot, urging them on\r\nby voice and example to still greater exertions.  He seemed to be\r\neverywhere and doing everything at once.\r\n\r\n\"Hello, old man!  We've got greenbacks to burn, and we're a-burning\r\n'em,\" he cried cheerily as he paused to greet his friend, and at the\r\nsame time dash the streaming perspiration from his face with a grimy\r\nhand.  \"What's the news?\"\r\n\r\n\"The news is that you are a trump!\" exclaimed White, \"and that in spite\r\nof all you are doing for us we want you to grant us still another\r\nfavour.\"\r\n\r\n\"Name it, my boy, and if it is anything within reason, including a\r\ndefiance of the whole British navy, I'll do it,\" laughed Cabot.\r\n\r\n\"I hope you will, for it is something that we all want you to do very\r\nmuch,\" responded White.  \"You see it's this way.  I spoke of your\r\nsuggestion to mother, and she thought so well of it that I went to the\r\nmagistrate and got him to draw up a deed transferring this property,\r\nfor a nominal consideration, to a friend.  Now it is all ready for\r\nsignatures, and we want you to be that friend.\"\r\n\r\n\"Me!\" cried Cabot, completely staggered by this unexpected result of\r\nhis own planning.  \"You can't mean that.  Why, you don't know anything\r\nabout me.  For all you know I might never give the property back to\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"We are willing to risk that,\" replied White, \"and would rather trust\r\nyou to act for us in this matter than any one else we know.  It is a\r\nbig favour to ask, I know; but you said you felt indebted to me and\r\nonly wanted a chance to pay off the debt, so I thought perhaps--but if\r\nyou don't want to do it, of course----\"\r\n\r\n\"But I will, if you really want me to,\" cried Cabot.  \"I have always\r\nlonged to own a lobster factory.  It never entered my head when I\r\nproposed the plan that I would help carry it out; but if you think I\r\ncan be of the slightest assistance in that way, why of course I am only\r\ntoo glad.\"\r\n\r\nSo the papers constituting Cabot Grant, Esq., sole owner of the Pretty\r\nHarbour lobster factory were duly signed and recorded; and at sunset of\r\nthat very evening our hero stood regarding his suddenly acquired\r\nproperty with the air of one who is dubiously pleased at a prospect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nBLUFFING THE BRITISH NAVY.\r\n\r\nCabot was not long allowed to enjoy his sense of possession before\r\nexperiencing some of the anxieties of proprietorship; for, even as he\r\nstood overlooking his newly acquired factory, a clipper-built schooner,\r\nshowing the fine lines and tall topmasts of an American, rounded the\r\nouter headland and entered the harbour.  For a few minutes our young\r\nengineer, who was learning to appreciate the good points of a vessel,\r\nwatched her admiringly as she glided across the basin and drew near the\r\nfactory wharf.  Then he was joined by White, who had been detained at\r\nthe house, and they went down together to greet the new-comer.\r\n\r\nShe proved to be the fishing schooner \"Ruth\" of Gloucester, and her\r\nskipper, who introduced himself as Cap'n Ezekiel Bland, explained that\r\nhe had come to the coast after bait.\r\n\r\n\"I 'lowed to get it in St. George,\" he said, \"but there was a pesky\r\nFrench frigate that wouldn't allow the natives to sell us so much as a\r\nherring, though they had a-plenty and were keen to make a trade for the\r\nstuff I've got aboard.\"\r\n\r\n\"What kind of stuff?\" asked Cabot, curiously.\r\n\r\n\"Flour and pork mostly.  You see, I'm bound on a long trip, and being\r\nobliged to lay in a big supply of grub anyway, thought I might as well\r\nstow a few extra barrels to trade for bait; but now it looks like I\r\ncouldn't get rid of 'em unless I give 'em away.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's plenty of bait in the bay,\" remarked White.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, so I've heard, and a plenty of frigates, too.  The Frenchy must\r\nhave suspicioned where I was bound, for he has followed us up sharp,\r\nand as we came by South Head I seen him jest a bilin' along 'bout ten\r\nmile astarn, and now he'll poke into every hole of the bay till he\r\nfinds us.  Anyhow, there won't be no chance to trade long as he's\r\nround, for you folks don't dare say your soul's your own when there's a\r\nFrenchy on the coast.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor hardly at any other time,\" remarked White, moodily.\r\n\r\n\"There's another one, too--Britisher, I reckon--went up the bay towards\r\nHumber Arm ahead of us.  I only wish the two tarnal critters would get\r\ninto a scrap and blow each other out of the water.  Then there'd be\r\nsome chance for honest folks to make a living.  Now I'm up a stump and\r\ndon't know what to do, unless some of you people can let me have a few\r\nbarrels of bait right off, so's I can clear out again to-night.\"\r\n\r\n\"There isn't any to be had here,\" replied White, \"for this is a lobster\r\nfactory, and the whole business of the place, just at present, is\r\ncatching and canning lobsters.  You'll find some round at York Harbour,\r\nthough.\"\r\n\r\n\"No use going there now, nor anywhere else, long as that pesky\r\nFrenchman's on the lookout.  Can't think what made him leave St. Pierre\r\nin such a hurry.  Thought he was good to stay there a week longer at\r\nany rate.  But say, who owns this factory?\"\r\n\r\n\"This gentleman is the proprietor,\" replied White, indicating his\r\ncompanion as he spoke.\r\n\r\n\"Hm!\" ejaculated the Yankee skipper, regarding Cabot with an air of\r\ninterest.  \"Never should have took you to be the owner of a\r\nNewfoundland lobster factory.  Sized you up to be a Yankee same as\r\nmyself, and reckoned you was here on a visit.  Seeing as you are the\r\nboss, though, how'd you like to trade your pack for my cargo--lobsters\r\nfor groceries?  Both of us might make a good thing out of it.  Eh?\r\nI'll take all the risks, and neither of us needn't pay no duty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't do it,\" replied Cabot promptly, \"because, in the first place,\r\nI'm not in the smuggling business, and in the second our whole pack is\r\nengaged by parties in St. Johns.\"\r\n\r\n\"As for the smuggling part,\" responded Captain Bland, \"I wouldn't let\r\nthat worry me a little bit.  Everybody smuggles on this coast, which is\r\nneither British, French, nor Newfoundland.  So a man wouldn't rightly\r\nknow who to pay duties to, even if he wanted to pay 'em ever so bad,\r\nwhich most of us don't.  If you have engaged your goods to St. Johns,\r\nthough, of course a bargain is a bargain.  Same time I could afford to\r\npay you twice as much as any St. Johns merchant.  But it don't matter\r\nmuch one way or another, seeing as the idea of trading was only an idea\r\nas you may say that just popped into my head.  Well, so long.  It's\r\ncoming on dark, and I must be getting aboard.  See you to-morrow,\r\nmebbe.\"\r\n\r\nAs the Yankee skipper took his departure, Cabot and White turned into\r\nthe factory, where all night long fires blazed and roared beneath the\r\nseething kettles.\r\n\r\nUntil nearly noon of the following day the work of canning lobsters was\r\ncontinued without interruption, and pushed with all possible energy.\r\nThen a boy, who had been posted outside the harbour as a lookout, came\r\nhurrying in to report that he had seen a naval launch steaming in that\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nThe emergency for which Cabot had been planning ever since he consented\r\nto become the responsible head of the concern was close at hand, and he\r\nat once began to take measures to meet it.\r\n\r\n\"Draw your fires,\" he shouted.  \"Empty the kettles and cool them off.\r\nPass all cans, empty or full, up into the loft, and then every one of\r\nyou clear out.  Remember that you are not to know a thing about the\r\nfactory, if anybody asks questions, and you don't even want to give any\r\none a chance to ask questions if you can help it.  Run up to the\r\nhouse,\" he added, turning to the boy who had brought tidings of the\r\nenemy's approach, \"and tell Mrs. Baldwin, with my compliments, that the\r\ncarriage is ready for her drive.\"\r\n\r\nSo thoroughly had everything been explained and understood beforehand,\r\nand so promptly were these orders obeyed, that, half an hour later,\r\nwhen a jaunty man-of-war's launch, flying a British Jack, entered the\r\nlittle harbour, every preparation had been made for her reception.  The\r\nfactory, closed and silent, presented no outward sign that it had been\r\nin operation for months.  Those who had recently worked so\r\nindustriously within its weather-stained walls now lounged about their\r\nown house doors, or on the village street, as though they had nothing\r\nto do, and limitless leisure in which to do it.  White Baldwin, with\r\nhis mother and sister, had driven away in a cart, leaving their\r\ntenantless house with closed doors and tightly shuttered windows.\r\nCabot Grant, with hands thrust into his trousers pockets, leaned\r\nagainst a wharf post and surveyed the oncoming launch with languid\r\ncuriosity.  The Yankee schooner swung gracefully at her moorings, and\r\nfrom her a boat was pulling towards shore; while on the deck of the\r\n\"Sea Bee,\" also anchored in the stream, David Gidge placidly smoked a\r\npipe.\r\n\r\nThe launch slowed down as it neared him, and an officer inquired in the\r\ncrisp tones of authority:\r\n\r\n\"What place is this?\"\r\n\r\nDeliberately taking the pipe from his mouth, and looking about him as\r\nthough to refresh his memory, Mr. Gidge answered:\r\n\r\n\"I've heard it called by a number of names.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was one of them Pretty Harbour?\"\r\n\r\n\"Now that you mention it, I believe it were.\"\r\n\r\n\"What kind of a building is that?\" continued the officer, sharply,\r\npointing to the factory as he spoke.\r\n\r\nDavid gazed at the building with interest, as though now seeing it for\r\nthe first time.\r\n\r\n\"Looks to me like a barn,\" he said at length.  \"Same time it might be a\r\nchurch, though I don't reckon it is.\"\r\n\r\n\"Isn't it a lobster factory?\"\r\n\r\n\"They might make lobsters in it, but I don't think they does.  Mebbe\r\nthat young man on the wharf could tell ye.  He looks knowing.\"\r\n\r\nDisgusted at this exhibition of stupidity, and muttering something\r\nabout a chuckle-headed idiot, the officer motioned for his launch to\r\nmove ahead, and, in another minute, it lay alongside the wharf.\r\n\r\n\"Is this the Pretty Harbour lobster factory?\" demanded the officer as\r\nhe stepped ashore.\r\n\r\n\"I believe it was formerly used as a lobster cannery,\" replied Cabot,\r\nguardedly, \"but no business of the kind is being carried on here at\r\npresent.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is owned by the family of the late William Baldwin, is it not?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who then does own the property?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do.\"\r\n\r\n\"You!\" exclaimed the officer.  \"And pray, sir, who are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am an American citizen named Grant, and have recently acquired this\r\nproperty by purchase.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed.  Then of course you possess papers showing the transfer of\r\nownership.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should like to look at them.\"\r\n\r\n\"They have been sent for record to the county seat, where any one who\r\nchooses may examine them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where shall I find a person by the name of Whiteway Baldwin?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't tell you, as he has left the place.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is any member of his family here?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.  All of them went with him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you the keys of this factory?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I must trouble you to open it, as I wish to look inside.\"\r\n\r\nAs the two entered the building, and the officer caught sight of the\r\nmachinery used in canning lobsters, he said:\r\n\r\n\"I am very sorry, Mr. Grant, but I have orders to destroy everything\r\nfound in this factory that has been, or may be, used in the canning of\r\nlobsters.\"\r\n\r\n\"Those orders apply to the property of Mrs. William Baldwin, do they\r\nnot?\"\r\n\r\n\"They do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, sir, since she no longer owns this building, and I do, together\r\nwith all that it contains, I warn you that if you destroy one penny's\r\nworth of my property I shall at once bring suit for damages against\r\nboth you and your commanding officer.  I can command plenty of money\r\nand a powerful influence at home, both of which shall be brought to\r\nbear on the case.  If it goes against you my claim will be pressed by\r\nthe American Government at the Court of St. James.  Moreover, articles\r\nconcerning the outrage will be published in all the leading American\r\npapers.  Public sentiment will be aroused, and you doubtless know as\r\nwell as any one whether England, with all the troubles now on her\r\nhands, can afford to incur the ill will of the American people for the\r\nsake of a pitiful lobster factory.  You can see for yourself that no\r\nillegal business--nor in fact business of any kind--is being carried on\r\nhere at present, and, under the circumstances, I would advise you to\r\ntake time for serious reflection before you begin to destroy the\r\nproperty of an American citizen.\"\r\n\r\nBewildered by this unexpected aspect of the situation, and remembering\r\nhow a suit brought by the proprietors of that same factory had gone\r\nagainst a former British commander who had interfered with its\r\noperations, the officer hemmed and hawed and made several remarks\r\nuncomplimentary to Americans, but finally decided to lay the case\r\nbefore his captain.  As he reëntered his launch he said:\r\n\r\n\"Of course you understand, sir, that no work of any kind is to be done\r\nin this building between this and the time of my return, nor may\r\nanything whatever be removed from it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand perfectly,\" replied Cabot.  Yet within half an hour the\r\nemployees of the factory had returned to their tasks, fires had been\r\nre-lighted, kettles were boiling merrily, and the place again hummed\r\nwith busy activity.\r\n\r\n\"Young feller, it was the biggest bluff I ever see, and it worked!\"\r\nexclaimed Captain Ezekiel Bland a few minutes earlier, as he stood on\r\nthe wharf with Cabot watching the departing launch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nENGLAND AND FRANCE COME TO BLOWS.\r\n\r\nThe Baldwins returned to their home shortly after the departure of the\r\ndiscomfited officer, and listened with intense interest to Cabot's\r\nreport of all that had taken place during their absence.\r\n\r\n\"So one but a Yankee would have thought of such a plan!\" exclaimed\r\nWhite, \"or had the cheek to carry it out.  But it makes me feel as mean\r\nas dirt to have run away and left you to face the music alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"You needn't,\" replied Cabot, \"for your absence was one of the most\r\nimportant things, and I couldn't possibly have carried out the\r\nprogramme if you had been there.  Now, though, we've got to hustle, for\r\nI expect that navy chap will be back again to-morrow, and whatever we\r\ncan accomplish between now and then will probably end the\r\nlobster-packing business so far as this factory is concerned.\"\r\n\r\nThat night the workers received a reinforcement, as unexpected as it\r\nwas welcome, from the crew of the Yankee schooner, who, led by Captain\r\nBland, came to assist their fellow countryman in his struggle against\r\nforeign oppression.  With this timely and expert aid, the canning\r\nbusiness was so rushed that by ten o'clock of the next morning, when\r\nthe lookout again reported a launch to be approaching, every can was\r\nfilled and the pack was completed.  More than half of it had also been\r\nremoved from the factory and stowed aboard the \"Sea Bee,\" ready for\r\ndelivery to the St. Johns purchaser.\r\n\r\n\"I wish he were here now,\" said White, \"so that we might settle up our\r\nbusiness with him before those chaps arrive.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, he isn't,\" replied Cabot, \"and we must protect the goods as best\r\nwe can until he comes.  In the meantime I think you'd better disappear\r\nand leave me to manage alone, the same as I did yesterday.\"\r\n\r\n\"No.  I won't run away again.  I'm going to stay and face the music.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" agreed Cabot.  \"Perhaps it will be just as well, since the\r\nfactory is closed sure enough this time.  You must let me do all the\r\ntalking, though, and perhaps in some way we'll manage to scare 'em off\r\nagain.\"\r\n\r\n\"If we could have just one day more we'd be all right,\" said White,\r\n\"but there they come.  Only, I say!  They are Frenchmen this time.  See\r\nthe flag.\"\r\n\r\nSure enough.  Instead of flying the British Union Jack the launch that\r\nnow appeared in the harbour displayed the tri-colour of the French\r\nRepublic.  Thus, when Cabot and White reached the wharf, they were just\r\nin time to greet their acquaintance of St. Pierre, the lieutenant of\r\nthe French frigate \"Isla,\" whom White had so neatly outwitted in that\r\nport.  As he stepped ashore he was accompanied by a sharp-featured,\r\nblack-browed individual, whom White recognised as M. Delom, proprietor\r\nof a French lobster factory located on another shore of the bay.\r\n\r\n\"That chap has come for pickings and stealings,\" he remarked in a low\r\ntone.\r\n\r\n\"Shouldn't wonder,\" returned Cabot, \"for he looks like a thief.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, ha, Monsieur Baldwin!  I haf catch you zis time, an' you cannot\r\nnow gif me what you call ze sleep,\" cried the French lieutenant.  \"Also\r\nI am come to siz your property, for you may no more can ze lob of ze\r\nFrançaise.  Behol'!  I have ze aut'orization.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, the officer drew forth and unfolded with a flourish a paper\r\nthat he read aloud.  It was an order for the confiscation and removal\r\nof all property owned by a person, or persons, named Baldwin, and used\r\nby them contrary to law in canning lobsters on the French territory of\r\nNewfoundland, and it was signed: \"Charmian, Capitan de Frégate.\"\r\n\r\n\"So, Monsieur Baldwin,\" continued the officer, when he had finished the\r\nreading, \"you will gif to me ze key of your factory zat I may from it\r\nremof ze materiel.  I sall also take your schooner for to convey it to\r\nze factory of M. Delom.  Is it plain, ma intention?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your intention is only too plain,\" responded White.  \"You are come to\r\naid that thief in stealing my property; but you are too late, for the\r\nfactory no longer belongs to the Baldwin family.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!  Is it so?  Who zen belong to it?\"\r\n\r\n\"This gentleman is the present owner,\" replied White, \"and you must\r\narrange your business with him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who is he?\" demanded the Frenchman, surveying Cabot contemptuously\r\nfrom head to foot.  \"But I do not care.  Ze material mus all ze same be\r\nremof.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am an American citizen,\" interrupted Cabot, \"and I forbid you to\r\ntouch my property.  If you do so I shall claim damages through the\r\nAmerican government, and in the meantime I shall call on the British\r\nfrigate now in this bay for protection.\"\r\n\r\n\"For ze Americains I do not care,\" cried the Frenchman, assuming a\r\ntheatrical attitude.  \"For l'Anglais, pouf!  I also care not.  When it\r\nis my duty I do him.  Ze material mus be remof.  Allons, mes garçons.\"\r\n\r\nA dozen French bluejackets, armed with cutlasses and pistols, had\r\ngathered behind their leader, and now these sprang forward with a\r\nshout, clearing a way through the collected throng of villagers.\r\nAdvancing upon the main entrance to the factory, they quickly battered\r\ndown its door and rushed inside.  With them went swarthy-faced Delom,\r\nwho gloated over the spoil that now seemed within his grasp, and which\r\nwould make his own factory the best equipped on the coast, he was\r\nespecially pleased to note the pack all boxed ready for shipment, and\r\nour lads saw him direct the officer's attention to it.  As a result the\r\nlatter gave an order, and in another minute a file of French\r\nbluejackets, each with a case of canned lobster on his shoulder, was\r\nmarching towards the door.\r\n\r\nJust as they reached it there came a shout and a tramp of heavy feet\r\nfrom the outside.  Then a stern voice cried:\r\n\r\n\"Halt!  What are you doing here, you French beggars?  Drop those boxes\r\nand clear out.\"\r\n\r\nAs the Frenchmen halted irresolute, their officer, who could not see\r\nwhat was going on, but imagined that some of the villagers were\r\nblocking the entrance, shouted for them to march on and clear away the\r\ncanaille who dared oppose them.\r\n\r\nThe French bluejackets attempted to obey, but, with their first forward\r\nmovement, they were met by an inrush of sturdy British sailors, who\r\nsent them and their burdens crashing to the floor in every direction.\r\nSome of them as they regained their feet drew their cutlasses, while\r\nothers fell upon the new-comers with their fists.  A pistol shot rang\r\nout, and a British sailor pitched heavily forward.  At the same instant\r\nboth officers sprang into the mêlée, beating back their men with the\r\nflat of their swords, and fiercely ordering them to desist from further\r\nfighting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Others fell on the new-comers with their fists.]\r\n\r\nSo sharp had been the brief encounter between these hereditary enemies,\r\nthat as they sullenly withdrew their clutch from each other's throats a\r\nBritish sailor remained on the floor striving to staunch the blood that\r\nspurted from a bullet wound in his leg, while near at hand lay a French\r\nbluejacket, as white and motionless as though dead.  Another Frenchman\r\nhad a broken arm, while several others on both sides looked askance at\r\ntheir enemies from blackened eyes and swollen faces.\r\n\r\n\"Sir!\" cried the French lieutenant, the moment order was so far\r\nrestored that he could make himself heard, \"I am bidden by my\r\ncommandant, ze Chevalier Charmian, capitan de frigate 'Isla,' to remof\r\nall material from zis building, and in his name I protest against zis\r\nmos outrage interference.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" answered the British officer, \"I am ordered by my captain to\r\ndestroy all property contained in this building, and not permit the\r\nremoval of a single article.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I will not allow it destroyed!\"\r\n\r\n\"And I will not allow it removed.\"\r\n\r\nFor a moment the two glared at each other in speechless rage.  Then the\r\nFrenchman said:\r\n\r\n\"As humanity compels me to gif immediate attention to my men, wounded\r\nby ze unprovoked assault of your barbarians, I sall at once carry zem\r\nto my sheep, where I sail immediately also report zis outrage to my\r\ncommandant.\"\r\n\r\n\"Same here,\" replied the Englishman, laconically, and with this both\r\nofficers ordered their men to fall back to the launches, carrying with\r\nthem their wounded comrades.\r\n\r\nDuring the progress of this thrilling episode our two lads had watched\r\nit in breathless excitement without once thinking of leaving the\r\nbuilding, though a back door opened close at hand.  So intent were they\r\nupon what was taking place that they did not notice the approach of a\r\nthird person until he was close beside them and had addressed White by\r\nname.  He was the St. Johns travelling man, who had engaged the Baldwin\r\npack for his firm, and now he said in low, hurried tones:\r\n\r\n\"You fellows want to skip out of this while you can, for that British\r\nofficer has got orders to arrest you both and carry you to St. Johns\r\nfor trial.  Charges--contempt of court and carrying on an illegal\r\nbusiness.  Awfully sorry I can't take your goods, but order has been\r\nissued that any one handling them will also be arrested and subject to\r\nheavy fine.  Hurry up.  They are making a move, and he'll be looking\r\nfor you directly.  Don't let on that I gave you the tip.\"\r\n\r\nWith this the man moved away, and without exchanging a word our lads\r\nslipped out of the nearby door.\r\n\r\nSo fully was the British officer occupied in getting his men back to\r\ntheir launch without making another attack upon their hated rivals,\r\nthat not until all were safely on board did he remember that he had\r\nbeen charged to bring off two prisoners.  Now he was in a quandary.\r\nThose whom he desired were nowhere to be seen, and he dared not leave\r\nhis men, whose fighting blood was still at fever heat, long enough to\r\ngo in search of them.  Also the French launch was about to depart, and\r\nit would never do for the captain of the \"Isla\" to be informed of the\r\nrecent unfortunate encounter in advance of his own commander.  So, with\r\na last futile look ashore, he reluctantly gave the order to shove off,\r\nand side by side, their crews screaming taunts at each other, the two\r\nlaunches raced out of the harbour.\r\n\r\nAs Cabot and White watched them from a place of snug concealment, the\r\nlatter heaved a sigh of relief, saying:\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'm mighty glad they're gone, and haven't got us with them; but\r\nI do wish that fight could have lasted a few minutes longer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wasn't it lovely!\" retorted Cabot, \"and isn't the lobster industry on\r\nthis coast just about the most exciting business in the world!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nA PRISONER OF WAR.\r\n\r\nWith the disappearance of the launches our lads realised that it was\r\ntime to make new plans for immediate action.  So, as they walked slowly\r\nback towards the village, they earnestly discussed the situation.\r\n\r\n\"It is too bad that I have drawn you into such a scrape,\" said White,\r\n\"and the very first thing for me to do is to make an effort to get you\r\nout of it.  So, if you like, I will drive you over to the station this\r\nafternoon, where you can take the morning train for St. Johns.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied Cabot, \"that wouldn't do at all.  In the first place, you\r\ndidn't draw me into the scrape.  I went into it with my eyes open, and\r\nam quite ready to stand by what I have done.  In fact I rather enjoy it\r\nthan otherwise.  At the same time I do not propose to be arrested if I\r\ncan help it, and for that reason do not care to visit St. Johns at\r\npresent.  Even at the railway station we should be very likely to meet\r\nand be recognised by some of our recent unpleasant naval acquaintances.\r\nBesides, I am going to see this thing through, and shall stand by you\r\njust as long as I can be of any service, for I hope you don't think so\r\nmeanly of me as to imagine that I would desert in the time of his\r\ntrouble the fellow who saved my life.\"\r\n\r\n\"I never for one moment thought meanly of you,\" declared White, \"and I\r\nknow that in rescuing you from that raft I also gained for myself one\r\nof the best friends I ever had.  For that very reason, though, I don't\r\nwant to abuse your friendship.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" laughed Cabot.  \"Whenever I feel abused I'll let you know.\r\nAnd now, it being settled that we are to fight this thing out together,\r\nwhat do you propose to do with the pack we have worked so hard to make?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" replied White, despondently; \"but, as it is legally\r\nyour property, I think you ought to decide what is to be done with it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense!\" retorted Cabot.  \"It no more really belongs to me than it\r\ndoes to that black-faced Frenchman.  At the same time I'd fight rather\r\nthan let him have it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd toss every case into the sea first,\" cried White, \"and everything\r\nthe factory contains besides.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Same here,' as the Englishman said; but I guess we can do better than\r\nthat.  Why not accept Captain Bland's offer, and trade it to him for\r\ngroceries?\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought you were opposed to receiving smuggled goods?\"\r\n\r\n\"So I am on general principles,\" admitted Cabot, \"but circumstances\r\nalter cases.  I consider the highway robbery that two of the most\r\npowerful nations of the world are attempting right here a circumstance\r\nstrong enough to alter any case.  So I would advise you to accept the\r\nonly offer now remaining open.  You will at least get enough groceries\r\nto keep your family supplied for a year.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should say so, and for two years more, provided the goods didn't\r\nspoil.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you might sell what you couldn't use.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where?\" asked White.  \"Not in Newfoundland, for they would be seized\r\nas contraband in any part of the island.  Besides, you seem to forget\r\nthat as both of us are liable to arrest, we are hardly in a position to\r\ngo into the grocery business just at present.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's so.  Well, then, why not carry them somewhere else in the 'Sea\r\nBee'?  To Canada, or--I have it!  You said something once about making\r\na trading trip to Labrador, and now is the very opportunity.  Why\r\nshouldn't we take the goods to Labrador?  I don't believe we'd be\r\narrested in that country, even for smuggling, and they must need a lot\r\nof provisions up there.  It's the very thing, and the sooner we can\r\narrange to be off the better.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you don't want to go to Labrador,\" protested White.\r\n\r\n\"Don't I?  There's where you make a big mistake; for I do want to go to\r\nLabrador more than to any other place I know of.  Also I would rather\r\ngo there with you in the 'Sea Bee' than in any other company, or by any\r\nother conveyance.  So there you are, and if you don't invite me to\r\nstart for Labrador before that brass-bound navy chap has a chance to\r\narrest me, I shall consider myself a victim of misplaced confidence.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do believe you have hit upon the very best way out of our troubles,\"\r\nsaid White, thoughtfully.  \"If I could arrange to leave mother, and if\r\nthe Yankee captain would make a part payment in cash, so that she and\r\nCola could get along until my return, I believe I would go.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can leave your mother and sister now as well as when you went to\r\nSt. Johns, and better, for I am sure David Gidge would look out for\r\nthem during the month or so that we'll be away.\"\r\n\r\n\"But David would have to go along to help work the schooner.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't see why.  You and I could manage without him, and so save his\r\nwages, or his share of the voyage, which would amount to the same\r\nthing.  If one man can sail a 30-foot boat around the world alone, as\r\nCaptain Slocum did, two of us certainly ought to be able to take a\r\n50-foot schooner up to Labrador and back.  Any way I'm game to try it,\r\nif you are, and I'd a heap rather risk it than stay here to be\r\narrested.  There is Captain Bland now.  Let's go and talk with him.\"\r\n\r\nThe Yankee skipper stood near the shattered door of the factory in\r\ncompany with a number of villagers, all of whom seemed greatly\r\ninterested in something going on inside.  As our lads drew near these\r\nmade way for them, and Captain Bland said:\r\n\r\n\"'Pears like the new owner is making himself perfectly at home.\"\r\n\r\nInside the factory the Frenchman Delom, who had remained behind to make\r\ngood his claim to the confiscated property of his rival, was too busily\r\nat work to pay any attention to the disparaging remarks and muttered\r\nthreats of those whom he had forbidden to enter.  He had collected all\r\nthe tools and lighter machinery into a pile ready for removal, and was\r\nnow marking with his own stencil such of the filled cases as remained\r\non the lower floor.\r\n\r\nSo dreaded was the power of France on that English coast that up to\r\nthat moment no one had dared interfere with him, but Cabot Grant was\r\nnot troubled by a fear of France or any other nation, and, as he\r\nrealised what was going on, he sprang into the building.  The next\r\ninstant our young football player had that Frenchman by the collar and\r\nwas rushing him towards the doorway.  From it he projected him so\r\nviolently that the man measured his length on the ground a full rod\r\nbeyond it.\r\n\r\nLivid with rage at this assault, the Frenchman scrambled to his feet,\r\nwhipped out an ugly-looking knife, and started towards Cabot with\r\nmurderous intent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Livid with rage, the Frenchman whipped out an\r\nugly-looking knife.]\r\n\r\n\"No you don't,\" shouted Captain Bland, and in another moment Monsieur\r\nDelom's arms were pinioned behind him, while he struggled helplessly in\r\nthe iron grasp of the Yankee skipper.\r\n\r\n\"I think we'd better tie him,\" remarked the latter quietly.  \"'Tain't\r\nsafe to let a varmint like this loose on any community.\"\r\n\r\nWhite produced a rope and was stepping forward with it, but Cabot took\r\nit from him, saying: \"For the sake of your family you mustn't have\r\nanything to do with this affair.\"  So he and Captain Bland bound the\r\nFrenchman hand and foot, took away his knife, and carried him for\r\npresent safe keeping to a small, dark building that was used for the\r\nstorage of fish oil.  Here they locked him in, and left him to meditate\r\nat leisure on the fate of those who have done to them, what they would\r\ndo to others if they could.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Captain Bland, at the conclusion of this incident, \"you\r\nyoung fellers always seem to have something interesting on hand; what\r\nare you going to do next?  Are you going to skin out, or wait for the\r\nreturn of the French and English fleets?  I'd like to know, 'cause I\r\nwant to be getting a move on; but if there's going to be any more fun I\r\nexpect I'll have to wait and take it in.\"\r\n\r\n\"I expect our next move depends very largely on you, captain,\" replied\r\nWhite.  \"Are you still willing to trade your cargo for our pack?\"\r\n\r\n\"I might be, and then again I mightn't,\" answered the Yankee, as he\r\nmeditatively chewed a blade of grass.  \"You see, the risk of the thing\r\nhas been so increased during the past two days that I couldn't make\r\nnigh so good an offer now as I could at first.  Also, here's so many\r\nclaiming the pack of this factory that I'm in considerable doubt as to\r\nwho is the rightful owner.  First there's the Baldwin interest and the\r\nAmerican interest, represented by you two chaps.  Then there's the St.\r\nJohns interest, represented by that travelling man; the British\r\ninterest, which is a mighty powerful one, seeing that it is supported\r\nby the English navy; the French government interest, which is likewise\r\nbacked up by a fleet of warships, and the French factory interest,\r\nrepresented by our friend in limbo, who, though he isn't saying much\r\njust now, seems to have a pretty strong political pull.  So, on the\r\nwhole, the ownership appears to be muddled, and the pack itself subject\r\nto a good many conflicting claims.  I expect also that the factory\r\nworkmen and the lobster catchers have some sort of a lien on it for\r\nservices rendered.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look here, Captain Bland,\" said Cabot, \"we understand perfectly that\r\nall you have just said is trade talk, made to depreciate the value of\r\nour goods, and you know as well as I do that they have but one rightful\r\nowner.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who is that?\" asked the skipper with an air of interest.\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. William Baldwin.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I thought she deeded the property to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"So she did; but as I am not yet of age that deed is worth no more than\r\nthe paper on which it is written.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't mean it.  What a whopping big bluff it was then!\" cried\r\nCaptain Bland, admiringly.  \"Beats any I ever heard of, and I'm proud\r\nto know 'twas a Yankee that worked it.  What you say does alter the\r\nsituation considerable, and I'd like to have Miss Baldwin's own views\r\non the subject of a trade.\"\r\n\r\nIn accordance with this wish an adjournment was made to the house,\r\nwhere Mrs. Baldwin assured the Yankee skipper of her willingness to\r\nabide by any agreement made with him by her son and Mr. Grant.\r\n\r\n\"Which so simplifies matters, ma'am,\" replied the captain, \"that I\r\nthink we may consider a trade as already effected, and make bold to say\r\nthat this season's pack of the Pretty Harbour lobster factory will be\r\nsold somewhere's else besides Newfoundland.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nTHE \"SEA BEE\" UNDER FIRE.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement made with the Yankee skipper was satisfactory, save in\r\none respect.  He was willing to trade provisions for canned lobsters to\r\nthe extent of taking the entire pack, and he also offered to remove the\r\nmachinery outfit of the factory on the chance of finding a purchaser\r\nfor it in the States, but he refused to make any cash advance on the\r\ngoods.\r\n\r\n\"I'm willing,\" he said, \"to risk considerable for the sake of being\r\naccommodating, and with the hope of making a little something, but I\r\ncan't afford to risk cold cash.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't see how we can make a trade, then,\" remarked White, as he and\r\nCabot discussed the situation.  \"It will take every penny I've got to\r\npay off the hands, and though I believe we could make a good thing out\r\nof a Labrador trip, I can't leave mother and Cola without a cent while\r\nI'm away.  If he would only let me have fifty dollars----\"\r\n\r\n\"He won't, though,\" interrupted Cabot, \"but I will.  I have got just\r\nthat amount of money with me, and, as I shan't have any use for it in\r\nLabrador, I should be more than pleased to leave it here for safe\r\nkeeping.\"\r\n\r\nWhite at first refused to take his friend's money; but on Cabot's\r\ndeclaring that he had plenty more on deposit in St. Johns, he\r\ngratefully accepted the loan, which he promised to repay from the very\r\nfirst sale of goods they should make.\r\n\r\nEverything being thus arranged, preparations for departure were pushed\r\nwith all speed.  Such of the pack as remained in the factory was\r\nhurried aboard the \"Ruth\" by a score of willing workers, who also\r\ntransferred to her every tool and bit of machinery, including the big\r\nkettles.  Then she and the \"Sea Bee,\" the latter manned by two of the\r\nYankee sailors, with David Gidge as pilot, sailed from the harbour, and\r\nwere lost to sight beyond its protecting headland.\r\n\r\nThe next hour was spent in settling with the lobster catchers and those\r\nwho had been employed in the factory, each of whom was warned to give\r\nno information concerning the movements of the two schooners.  This was\r\nbarely finished when the boy who had been posted outside immediately\r\nafter the departure of the naval launches came hurrying in with news\r\nthat both of them were returning.\r\n\r\n\"My!\" cried Cabot, \"but I'd like to see the fun when they get here.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid you'd see more than enough of it,\" replied White, \"for\r\nthey'll be keen on getting us this time.  So we'd best be starting.\r\nHold on a minute, though; I want to leave proof behind that we haven't\r\ngone off with either of the schooners.\"\r\n\r\nWith this he ran down to the oil house, in which their well-nigh\r\nforgotten prisoner was still confined.  Flinging open the door, he\r\nsaid, in a tone of well-feigned regret:\r\n\r\n\"It is too bad, Monsieur Delom, that you should have been kept so long\r\nin this wretched place, but I dared not attempt your release while\r\nthose terrible Yankees were here.  Now, however, they are gone and you\r\nare once more free.  Also, as I realise that I can no longer maintain\r\nmy factory here, you are at liberty to make what use you please of its\r\ncontents.  Accept my congratulations on your good fortune, monsieur.\r\nAs for me, I must now leave you to prepare for my journey to St. Johns.\"\r\n\r\nWith this White bade the bewildered Frenchman a mocking adieu, and left\r\nhim still blinking at the sunlight from which he had been so long\r\nsecluded.\r\n\r\nA few minutes later the Baldwin house again stood, closed and\r\ntenantless, while a cart driven by Cola, and accompanied by the two\r\nyoung men on foot, climbed the hill back of the village by a road\r\nleading to the nearest railway station.  Monsieur Delom witnessed this\r\ndeparture, as did many others, but no one saw the cart leave the\r\nhighway a little later and turn into a dim trail leading through an\r\notherwise pathless forest.  After a time it emerged from this on\r\nanother road and came to a farmhouse to which Mrs. Baldwin had\r\npreviously been taken.  Here mother and son bade each other farewell,\r\nwhile the former also prayed for a blessing upon the stranger who had\r\nso befriended them, and whose fortunes had become so curiously linked\r\nwith theirs.  Then the cart with Cola still acting as driver rattled\r\naway, and was quickly lost to sight.\r\n\r\nIt lacked but an hour of sunset when our refugees reached a pocket on\r\nthe outer coast, in which the two schooners lay snugly, side by side,\r\nnearly filling the tiny harbour.  On the beach David Gidge already\r\nwaited, and, as the lads transferred their few effects to the boat that\r\nhad brought him ashore, he climbed stiffly into the cart which Cola was\r\nto guide back over the way it had just come.\r\n\r\n\"Good-bye, Cola,\" said Cabot, as he held for a moment the hand of the\r\ngirl he had come to regard almost as a sister.  \"Try and have a lot of\r\nspecimens ready for me when we come back.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good-bye, sister!\" cried White.  \"Take care of mother, and don't let\r\nher worry about us.  We'll be back almost before you have time to miss\r\nus.  Good-bye, David!  I trust you to look out for them because you\r\nhave promised.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! how I wish I were a boy and going with you,\" exclaimed Cola.  \"It\r\nis so stupid to be left behind with nothing to do but just wait.  Do\r\nplease hurry back.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" replied her brother.  \"With good luck we'll sail into\r\nPretty Harbour inside of a month, and perhaps with money enough to take\r\nus all to the States.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, wouldn't that be splendid!   Do get started, for the sooner you\r\nare off the quicker you'll come back,\" cried the girl.\r\n\r\n\"That's so.  Come on, Cabot,\" and in another minute the boat had shot\r\nout from the beach, while the cart was slowly climbing the rugged trail\r\nthat led inland.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the schooners our lads found Captain Bland impatiently\r\nawaiting them, since the transfer of goods was nearly completed, and he\r\nwas anxious to get his compromising cargo away from the coast patrolled\r\nby those meddlesome frigates.\r\n\r\n\"Let me once get beyond the three-mile limit,\" he said, \"and I wouldn't\r\nmind meeting a fleet of 'em; if either one of 'em caught me in here,\r\nthough, I'd not only stand to lose cargo, but schooner as well.  So I\r\nreckon we'd best get a move on at once, and talk business while we tow\r\nout.\"\r\n\r\nAs our lads wore equally desirous of gaining a safe distance from the\r\nauthorities they had so openly defied, they readily agreed to Captain\r\nBland's proposal, and four dories, each manned by a couple of stalwart\r\nYankee fishermen, were ordered to tow the schooners from their snug\r\nhiding place.  While this was going on, and White was busily engaged on\r\nthe deck of the \"Sea Bee,\" Cabot and Captain Bland were examining\r\ninvoices and price lists in her cabin.\r\n\r\n\"Here's a list of all I've put aboard,\" said the latter, \"and you'll\r\nsee I've only made a small freight charge over and above the cost price\r\nin Boston.  Same time I've allowed for your pack the full market price\r\non canned lobsters according to latest St. Johns quotations, and you\r\nought not to sell a single barrel at less 'n one hundred per cent.\r\nclear profit.  As for the kettles and tools, here's an order on my\r\nowners in Gloucester for them, or what they'll fetch less a freight\r\ncharge, provided I get 'em there all right; but I want both you and\r\nyoung Baldwin to sign this release that frees me from all claims for\r\nloss of property in case anything happens to 'em.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am perfectly willing to sign it,\" replied Cabot, \"because I have no\r\nownership in the property, but I shouldn't think Baldwin would care to\r\ngive such a release.\"\r\n\r\n\"I guess he will, though,\" said the skipper.\r\n\r\nAnd he was right, for White readily consented to sign the paper, saying\r\nthat the property would have been lost anyhow if it had been left\r\nbehind.  \"I have also full faith that Captain Bland will do the right\r\nthing about it,\" he added, \"for, while I have always found you Yankees\r\nsharp as knives in a trade, I have yet to meet one whom I wouldn't\r\ntrust.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, Mr. Baldwin,\" said the skipper, \"and I shall try my best\r\nnot to be the first to abuse your confidence.\"\r\n\r\nSo the paper was signed, and White had barely laid down his pen when\r\nthe occupants of the cabin were startled by a loud cry from above,\r\nfollowed almost immediately by a distant shot.  Hurrying on deck they\r\nfound that the schooner had reached open water and was beginning to\r\nfeel the influence of an offshore breeze.  At the same time the man\r\nwhom White had left at the tiller was pointing up the coast, where they\r\ncaught sight of a steam launch that had just cleared South Head.\r\n\r\n\"He fired a shot at us,\" announced the steersman.\r\n\r\n\"That's all right 'long's he didn't hit us,\" replied Captain Bland.\r\n\"It is our French friend, and he only took that way of hinting that he\r\nwished us to wait for him.  I don't think we can afford the time just\r\nnow, though--leastways, I can't.  Hello there in boats!  Drop your tow\r\nlines and come alongside.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think there is any chance of our getting away from him?\" asked\r\nCabot.\r\n\r\n\"Dunno.  Mebbe, if the breeze freshens, as I believe it will.  Anyhow,\r\nI'm going to give him a race for his money.  Good-bye!  Good luck, and\r\nI hope we'll meet again before long.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying Captain Bland, taking the steersman with him, stepped into a\r\ndory that had come alongside and was rowed towards his own schooner.\r\nHe had hardly gained her deck before she set main and jib topsails and\r\na big main staysail.  Our lads also sprang to their own sails, and\r\nspread to the freshening breeze every stitch of canvas that the \"Sea\r\nBee\" possessed.  When they next found time to look at the \"Ruth,\" White\r\nuttered an exclamation of astonishment, for she had already gained a\r\ngood half mile on them and was moving with the speed of a steam yacht.\r\n\r\n\"There's no chance of the Yankee being caught,\" he said enviously, \"but\r\nthere's a mighty big one that we will.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough the \"Sea Bee\" was holding a course in the wake of the \"Ruth,\"\r\nand was heeled handsomely over before the same freshening breeze, she\r\nwas not doing so well by a half, and it was evident that in a long run\r\nthe launch must overtake her.\r\n\r\n\"She is certainly gaining on us,\" said Cabot, after a long look, and he\r\nhad hardly spoken before a second shot from the launch plumped a ball\r\ninto the water abreast of the little schooner and not two rods away.\r\n\r\nWhite, who was at the tiller, glanced nervously backward.  \"Do you want\r\nto heave to and let them overhaul us?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly not,\" replied Cabot promptly.  \"They have no right to meddle\r\nwith us out here, and I would keep straight on without paying the\r\nslightest attention to them until they either sink us or get alongside.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" laughed the other.  \"I only wanted to make sure how you\r\nfelt.  Some fellows, you know, don't like to have cannon balls fired at\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nOFF FOR LABRADOR.\r\n\r\nSlowly but surely the launch gained on the flying schooner, until, as\r\nthe sun was sinking behind its western horizon of water, she fired a\r\nshot that passed through the \"Sea Bee's\" mainsail and fell a hundred\r\nyards beyond her.\r\n\r\n\"Wh-e-e-w!\" exclaimed White, as he glanced up at the clean-cut hole.\r\n\"That's rather too close for comfort, and I shouldn't be surprised if\r\nthe next one made splinters fly.  However, it will soon be dark, and\r\nthen, if we are not disabled, we may be able to give them the slip.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe there's going to be another shot,\" cried Cabot, who\r\nwas gazing eagerly astern.  \"No--yes--hurrah!  They are turning back.\r\nThey have given it up, old man, and we are safe.  Bully for us!  I\r\nwonder what possesses them to do such a thing, though, when they had so\r\nnearly caught us?\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't imagine,\" replied White, who was also staring at the launch,\r\nwhich certainly had circled back and was making towards the place\r\nwhence she had come.  \"They are afraid to be caught out at sea after\r\ndark perhaps.  I always understood that Frenchmen made mighty poor\r\nsailors.  Lucky thing for us she wasn't a British launch, for they'd\r\nhave kept on around the world but what they'd had us.\"\r\n\r\nIn justice to the Frenchmen it should be said that their reason for\r\nturning back, which our lads did not learn until long afterwards, was\r\nthe imminent exhaustion of their coal supply, which, not calculated for\r\na long cruise, would barely serve to carry them back to the Bay of\r\nIslands.\r\n\r\nBy the time the launch was lost to sight in the growing dusk the \"Ruth\"\r\nhad also disappeared.  She was headed southward when last seen, and now\r\nWhite said it was time that they, too, were turning towards their\r\nultimate destination.  So, topsails and mainstaysail were taken in, and\r\nthe helm was put down until fore and mainsails jibed over.  Then sheets\r\nwere trimmed until the little schooner, with lee rail awash, was\r\nrunning something east of north, on an easy bowline, carrying a bone in\r\nher teeth and leaving a bubbling wake trailing far astern.  With\r\neverything thus satisfactorily in shape, White lighted the binnacle\r\nlamp, and giving Cabot a course to steer, went below to prepare the\r\nfirst meal of their long cruise.  \"You must keep a sharp lookout,\" he\r\nsaid as he disappeared down the companionway, \"for I don't dare show\r\nany lights.  So if we are run into we'll have only ourselves to blame.\"\r\n\r\nLeft thus to his own devices, Cabot realised for the first time the\r\nresponsibility of his position and began to reflect seriously upon what\r\nhe had done.  Until this time one disturbing event had followed another\r\nso rapidly that he had been borne along almost without a thought of\r\nwhat he was doing or of the consequences.  As a result, instead of\r\ncarrying out the purpose for which he had been sent to Newfoundland,\r\nand studying its mineral resources, he now found himself forced into\r\nflight for having defied the authorities of the island, embarked upon a\r\ndoubtful trading venture into one of the wildest and least known\r\nportions of the continent, and, with but a slight knowledge of\r\nseamanship, engaged in navigating a small sailing vessel across one of\r\nits stormiest seas.  What would his guardian and employer say could he\r\nknow all this and see him at the present moment?\r\n\r\n\"I wish he could, though,\" exclaimed Cabot half aloud, \"for it would be\r\nfun to watch his look of amazement and hear his remarks.  I suppose he\r\nis wondering what has become of that Bell Island report I was to send\r\nin the first thing, and I guess he'll have to wonder for some time\r\nlonger, as St. Johns is about the last place I feel like visiting just\r\nat present.  I certainly have made a mess of my affairs, though, so\r\nfar, and it looks as if I had only just begun, too.  At the same time I\r\ndon't see how I could have acted differently.  I tried hard enough to\r\nreach St. Johns, and would have got there all right if it hadn't been\r\nfor this factory business.  But when the fellow who saved my life got\r\ninto trouble, from which I could help him out, I'm sure even Mr.\r\nHepburn would say I was bound to do it.  Besides, I have found one\r\npromising outcrop of copper, and now I'm off for Labrador; so perhaps\r\nthings will turn out all right after all.  Anyway I'm learning how to\r\nsail a boat, and that is something every fellow ought to know.  I wish\r\nit wasn't so awfully dark though, and that White would hurry up with\r\nthat supper, for I am powerful hungry.  How good it smells, and what a\r\nfine chap he is.  Falling in with him was certainly a great bit of\r\nluck.  But how this confounded compass wabbles, and how the schooner\r\njumps off her course if I lift my eyes from it for a single instant.  I\r\ndon't see why she can't go straight if I hold the tiller perfectly\r\nstill.  There's a star dead ahead, and I guess I'll steer by it.  Then\r\nI can keep the sharp lookout White spoke of at the same time.\"\r\n\r\nThus deciding, the anxious helmsman fixed his gaze upon the newly risen\r\nstar that he had just discovered, and wondered admiringly at its rapid\r\nincrease in brilliancy.  After a little he rubbed his eyes and looked\r\nagain at two more stars that had suddenly appeared above the horizon\r\ndirectly below the first one.\r\n\r\n\"Never saw red and green stars before,\" Cabot muttered.  \"Must be\r\npeculiar to this high latitude.  Wonder if they can be stars, though?\r\nOh! what a chump I am.  White!  I say, White, come up here quick!\"\r\n\r\nIn obedience to this summons the young skipper thrust his head from the\r\ncompanionway.\r\n\r\n\"What's up?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Don't know exactly,\" replied Cabot, \"but there is a lighthouse or a\r\ndock or something right in front of us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Steamer!\" cried White as he sprang on deck and glanced ahead.  \"Keep\r\nher away, quick.  I don't want them to sight us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Steamer,\" repeated Cabot as he obeyed this order and let the schooner\r\nfall off to leeward.  \"I never thought of such a thing as a steamer\r\naway up here.  Do you mean that she is a frigate?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" laughed White.  \"There are other steamers besides frigates even\r\nin these waters, and that is one of them.  She is the 'Harlaw,' from\r\nFlower Cove, near the northern end of the island, and bound for\r\nHalifax.  It's mighty lucky she didn't pass us by daylight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because she is already heading in for the Bay of Islands and would\r\nhave reported us as soon as she got there.  Then we would have had a\r\nfrigate after us sure enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how do you know she's a steamer?  Mightn't she be a sailing\r\nvessel!\"\r\n\r\n\"Not with that white light at her foremast head.  Sailing vessels\r\naren't allowed to show any above their side lights.  Now go below and\r\neat your supper while I take her.\"\r\n\r\nThis eating alone was such an unpleasant feature of the cruise that, as\r\nCabot sat down to his solitary meal, he regretted having persuaded\r\nWhite to leave David Gidge behind.\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid this going to sea shorthanded will prove a false economy\r\nafter all,\" he said to himself, thereby reaching a conclusion that has\r\nbeen forced upon seafaring men since ships first sailed the ocean.\r\n\r\nFinishing his supper as quickly as possible, Cabot rejoined his\r\ncompanion, and begged him also to hurry that they might bear each other\r\ncompany on deck.\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" agreed White, \"only, of course, I shall be longer than you\r\nwere, for I have to wash and put away the dishes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, bother the dishes!\" exclaimed Cabot \"Let them go till morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not much.  We haven't any too many dishes as it is, nor a chance of\r\ngetting any more, and if I should leave them where they are we probably\r\nwouldn't have any by morning.  Besides, it wouldn't be tidy, and an\r\nuntidy ship is worse than an untidy house, because you can't get away\r\nfrom it.  But I won't be long.\"\r\n\r\nTrue to his promise, White, bringing with him a heavy oilskin coat and\r\nan armful of blankets, speedily rejoined his comrade, who was by this\r\ntime shivering in the chill night air.\r\n\r\n\"Put this on,\" said the young skipper, tendering Cabot the oilskin,\r\n\"and then I am going to ask you to stand first watch.  I will roll up\r\nin these blankets and sleep here on deck, so that you can get me up at\r\na moment's notice.  You want to wake me at midnight, anyhow, when I\r\nwill take the morning watch.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" agreed Cabot resignedly.  \"I suppose you know what is best\r\nto be done, but it seems to me that we are arranging for a very\r\nlonesome cruise on regular Box and Cox lines.\"\r\n\r\nAs White had no knowledge of Box and Cox he did not reply to this\r\ngrumble, but, rolling up in his blankets until he resembled a huge\r\ncocoon, almost instantly dropped asleep.\r\n\r\nDuring the next four hours Cabot, shivering with cold and aching with\r\nweariness, but never once allowing his tired eyes to close, remained at\r\nhis post.  Through the black night, and over the still darker waters,\r\nhe guided the flying schooner according to the advice of the unstable\r\ncompass card that formed the only spot of light within his whole range\r\nof vision.  At the same time, knowing how little of skill he possessed\r\nin this new line of business, and not yet having a sailor's confidence\r\nin the craft that bore him, he was filled with such a fear of the\r\nnight, the wind, the leaping waters, and a thousand imaginary dangers\r\nthat his hardest struggle was against an ever-present impulse to arouse\r\nhis sleeping comrade.  But he would not yield, and finally had the\r\nsatisfaction of coming unaided to the end of his watch.\r\n\r\n\"Midnight, and all hands on deck,\" he shouted, and White, springing up,\r\nasked:\r\n\r\n\"What's happened?  Anything gone wrong?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing yet,\" replied Cabot, \"but something will happen if you leave\r\nme at this wretched tiller a minute longer.\"\r\n\r\n\"I won't,\" laughed the other.  \"It will only take me half a minute to\r\nget an eye-opener in shape of a cup of cold tea, and then you can turn\r\nin.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Cabot was at length free to seek his bunk he turned in all\r\nstanding, only kicking off his boots.  The very next thing of which he\r\nwas conscious was being shaken and told that breakfast was ready.\r\n\r\nIt was broad daylight; the sun was shining; the breeze had so moderated\r\nthat White had been able to leave the schooner to herself with a lashed\r\nhelm while he prepared breakfast, and as Cabot tumbled out he wondered\r\nif he had really been anxious and fearful a few hours earlier.\r\n\r\nAll that day and through the following night our lads kept watch and\r\nwatch while the \"Sea Bee\" travelled up the coast.  Early on the second\r\nmorning they passed Flower Cove, and from this point White headed\r\ndirectly across the Strait of Belle Isle, which, here, is but a dozen\r\nmiles in width.  Then, as Newfoundland grew dim behind them, a new\r\ncoast backed by a range of lofty hills came into view ahead; and, in\r\nanswer to Cabot's eager question, White said:\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that is Labrador, and those are the Bradore Hills back of\r\nForteau.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nMOSQUITOES OF THE FAR NORTH.\r\n\r\nWhile Cabot gazed eagerly at the lofty but still distant coast towards\r\nwhich all their hopes were now directed, his companion was casting\r\nanxious glances to the eastward, where a low hanging bank of cloud\r\nbetokened an advancing fog.  He had good reason to be apprehensive, for\r\nthis northern entrance to the gulf of St. Lawrence forms the shortest\r\nroute for steamers plying between Canadian and European ports.\r\nConsequently many of them use it during the brief summer season when it\r\nis free from ice.  At the same time it is a stormy stretch of water,\r\ntormented by powerful currents, and generally shrouded in fog.\r\n\r\nEarly in the season countless icebergs, borne southward by the Arctic\r\ncurrent that hugs the Labrador coast, drift aimlessly over its troubled\r\nsurface, and even at midsummer it is a passage to be dreaded.  White,\r\nbeing familiar with its many dangers, had good cause for anxiety, as he\r\nsaw one of them about to enfold his little craft.  He consulted the\r\ncompass, took his bearings with the utmost care, and then as Cabot,\r\nfinding his view obscured, turned to him with a look of inquiry,\r\nremarked:\r\n\r\n\"Yes, we are in for it, and you'd better keep a sharp lookout for\r\nsteamers.  It wouldn't be very pleasant to run one down and sink it,\r\nyou know.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should say not,\" responded Cabot as he started for the bow of the\r\nschooner, where, steadying himself by a stay, he peered into the\r\nthickening mist curtain.  For half an hour or so he saw nothing, though\r\nduring that time the hoarse bellowing of a steam whistle, approaching\r\nclosely and then receding, told of a passing ship.  While the lookout\r\nwas still listening to this a black form, magnified to gigantic size by\r\nhis apprehensions and the opaqueness through which he saw it, loomed up\r\ndirectly ahead and apparently not a rod away.  With a sharp cry of\r\nwarning the lad sprang aft, while a yell of dismay came from the\r\nstranger.  The next moment, both vessels having been headed sharply\r\ninto the wind, lay side by side, heaving and grinding against each\r\nother, with their sails slatting noisily overhead.\r\n\r\nAs our lads realised the true character of the other craft, they were\r\nready to laugh at their fright of a minute earlier, for she was only an\r\nopen fishing boat, carrying three men, a woman, and a couple of\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n\"We took ye for a steamer, first sight,\" remarked one of the men.\r\n\r\n\"And we did the same by you,\" laughed White.  \"Who are you and where\r\nare you bound?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mail boat from L'Anse Au Loup for Flower Cove,\" replied the man, \"and\r\nas we're not sure of our compass we'd be obleeged if you'd give us a\r\nbearing.\"\r\n\r\n\"With pleasure.  Come aboard and take it for yourself.  If you'll wait\r\njust a minute I'll have a letter ready for you.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying the young skipper dived below and hastily pencilled a line to\r\nhis mother, telling of their safety up to that time.\r\n\r\nWhile he was thus engaged Cabot learned that owing to the recent\r\narrival of a steamer from St. Johns provisions were plentiful on that\r\npart of the Labrador coast, but were believed to be scarce further\r\nnorth.\r\n\r\nAs a result of this information the \"Sea Bee\" was headed more to the\r\neastward after the boats had again parted company, for, as White said,\r\nthere was no use wasting time running in to Blanc Sablon, Forteau, or\r\nany of those places at which the trading steamer had touched.  \"It is\r\ntoo bad,\" he continued, \"for I did hope to dispose of our cargo\r\nsomewhere along here.  If we could do that we might be home again\r\ninside of ten days.  Now, if we have to go far to the northward, it may\r\nbe two or three weeks longer before we again sight Blomidon.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sorry for your sake,\" replied Cabot, \"though I would just as soon\r\nspend a month up here as not.  I only wish we could land somewhere\r\nalong here, for I am curious to see what land of a country Labrador is.\"\r\n\r\nThis wish was gratified late that afternoon, when the fog lifted in\r\ntime to disclose the fine harbour of Red Bay, into which, White said,\r\nthey would run, so as to spend the night quietly at anchor, with both\r\nwatches turned in at once.\r\n\r\nAt Red Bay, therefore, Cabot had his first taste of life in Labrador.\r\nThe shores looked so green and attractive that he wondered why the only\r\nsettlement in sight--a collection of a dozen huts and fish houses,\r\nshould be located on a rocky islet, bare and verdureless.  He asked\r\nWhite, who only laughed, and said he'd find out soon enough by\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nAfter they had come to anchor and lowered the sails, White got an empty\r\nwater cask into the dinghy, saying that first of all they must go about\r\na mile to a trout stream at the head of the bay for some fresh water.\r\n\r\n\"Trout stream!\" cited Cabot.  \"How I wish I had my fishing tackle.\r\nTrout for supper would be fine.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are other things equally important with tackle for trout fishing\r\nin this country,\" remarked White.\r\n\r\n\"What, for instance?\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll know inside of half an hour,\" was the significant reply.\r\n\r\nSo they rowed up the bay, Cabot filled with curiosity and White\r\nchuckling with anticipation.  The further they went the more was Cabot\r\ncharmed with the beauty of the scene and the more desirous did he\r\nbecome to ramble over the green slopes on which, as White assured him,\r\ndelicious berries of several varieties were plentiful.  At length they\r\nopened a charming valley, through which wound and tumbled a sparkling\r\nbrook thickly bordered by alders and birches.  At one side were several\r\nsubstantial log cabins, but as they were evidently uninhabited Cabot\r\nbegan to undress, declaring that he must have a bath in that tempting\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n\"Better keep your shirt on until we have filled the cask,\" advised\r\nWhite, at the same time stepping overboard in the shallows at the mouth\r\nof the stream without removing any of his clothing.  They pulled the\r\nboat up until it grounded, and then White began hurriedly to fill the\r\nwater barrel, while Cabot waded a short distance up stream to see if he\r\ncould discover any trout.  All at once he stopped, looked bewildered,\r\nand then started back on a run.  At the same time he slapped vigorously\r\nat his bare legs, brushed his face, waved his arms, and uttered\r\nexclamations of frantic dismay.  The air about him had been suddenly\r\nblackened by an incredible swarm of insects that issued in dense clouds\r\nfrom the low growth bordering the stream, and attacked the unfortunate\r\nyouth with the fury of starvation.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter?\" inquired White innocently, as his companion rushed\r\npast him towards the open.\r\n\r\n\"Matter!\" retorted the other.  \"I'm on fire with the bites of these\r\ninfernal things, and we want to get out of here in a hurry or they'll\r\nsting us to death.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, pshaw!\" laughed White, though he also was suffering greatly.\r\n\"You've only struck a few ordinary Labrador mosquitoes and black flies.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mosquitoes and black flies!\" cried Cabot.  \"Hornets and red-hot coals,\r\nyou'd better say.  How can you stand them?  Your skin must be thicker\r\nthan sole leather.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't very well,\" admitted White, \"but this cask has got to be\r\nfilled, and the sooner we do it the quicker we can get away.  Break off\r\na couple of leafy branches to fight with and then keep 'em off both of\r\nus as well as you can.  It will only take a few minutes longer.\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of their efforts at self-defence, faces, hands, and Cabot's\r\nbare legs were covered with blood before their task was completed, and\r\nthey were once more in the boat pulling furiously for the wind-swept\r\nwater of the open bay.\r\n\r\n\"I never expected to find mosquitoes this far north,\" said Cabot, as\r\nthe pests began to disappear before the freshening breeze and the\r\nrowers paused for breath.\r\n\r\n\"Strangers are apt to be unpleasantly surprised by them,\" replied\r\nWhite, \"but they are here all the same, and they extend as far north as\r\nany white man has ever been.  I have been told that they are as bad in\r\nGreenland as here, and I expect they flourish at the North Pole itself.\r\nThey certainly are the curse of Labrador, and until ice makes in the\r\nfall they effectually prevent all travel into the interior.  Even the\r\nIndians have to come to the coast in summer to escape them, while the\r\nwhites who visit this country for the fishing make their settlements on\r\nthe barest and most wind-swept places.  The few who live here the year\r\nround have summer homes on the coast, but build their winter houses\r\ninland, at the heads of bays or the mouths of rivers, where there is\r\ntimber to afford some protection from the cold.  Those are winter\r\nhouses back there.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wondered why they were abandoned,\" said Cabot, \"but I don't any\r\nlonger.\"\r\n\r\n\"By the way,\" suggested White, \"you forgot to try the trout fishing.\r\nShall we go back?\"\r\n\r\n\"I wouldn't go fishing on that stream if every trout in it was of solid\r\ngold and I could scoop them out with my hands,\" asserted Cabot.  \"In\r\nfact, I don't know of anything short of starvation, or dying of thirst,\r\nthat would take me back there.\"\r\n\r\nAfter supper our lads went ashore at the island settlement, and were\r\nhospitably received by the dwellers in its half-dozen stoutly built,\r\nearthen-roofed houses.  These were constructed of logs, set on end like\r\npalisades, and while they were scantily furnished, they were warm and\r\ncomfortable.  In them Cabot, who was regarded with great curiosity on\r\naccount of having come from the far foreign city of New York, asked\r\nmany questions, and acquired much information concerning the strange\r\ncountry to which Fate had brought him.  Thus he learned that Labrador\r\nis a province of Newfoundland, and that while its prolific fisheries\r\nattract some 20,000 people to its bleak shores every summer, its entire\r\nresident white population hardly exceeds one thousand souls.  He was\r\ntold that from June to October news of the outside world is received by\r\nsteamer from St. Johns every two or three weeks, but that during the\r\nother eight months of the year only three mails reach the country,\r\ncoming by dog sledge from far-away Quebec.\r\n\r\nWhile Cabot was gathering these and many other interesting bits of\r\ninformation, White was becoming confirmed in his belief that to make a\r\nsuccessful trading trip he must carry his goods far to the northward.\r\n\r\nSo at daybreak of the following morning the \"Sea Bee\" was once more got\r\nunder way, and ran up the rock-bound coast past Chateau Bay, with its\r\nsuperb Castle Rock, to Battle Harbour, the metropolis of Labrador,\r\nwhich place was reached late the same evening.\r\n\r\nAt this point, which is at the eastern end of the Belle Isle Strait, is\r\na resident population of some two hundred souls, a hospital, a church,\r\na schoolhouse, and a prosperous mercantile establishment.  Here our\r\nlads found a large steamer loading with dried fish for Gibraltar, and\r\nhere Cabot became greatly interested in the rose-tinted quartz that\r\nforms so striking a feature of Labrador scenery.\r\n\r\nAt Battle Harbour they were still advised to push farther on, and so,\r\nbidding farewell to this outpost of civilisation, the \"Sea Bee\" again\r\nspread her dusky wings and set forth for the mission stations of the\r\nfar North, where it was hoped a profitable market might be found.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nIMPRISONED BY AN ICEBERG.\r\n\r\nThe brief northern summer was nearly ended.  Its days were growing\r\nshort and chill, its nights long and cold.  The month of October was\r\nwell advanced, and flurries of snow heralded the approach of winter.\r\nMost of the Labrador fishing fleet had already sailed away, and the few\r\nboats still left were preparing for a speedy departure.  The last\r\nsteamer of the season had come and gone, and the few permanent\r\nresidents of the country were moving back from the coast into winter\r\nquarters.  Great flocks of geese streamed southward, and with harsh\r\ncries gave warning of the icy terrors that had driven them from their\r\nArctic nesting places.  Night after night the wonderful beauties of the\r\naurora borealis were flashed across the northern heavens with ever\r\nincreasing brilliancy.  Every one predicted a hard winter, and\r\neverything pointed to its early coming.\r\n\r\nNearly two months had elapsed since the little schooner \"Sea Bee,\"\r\nmanned by a couple of plucky lads, sailed out of Battle Harbour on a\r\ntrading venture to the northern missions, and from that day no tidings\r\nhad been received concerning her.  The few who remembered her,\r\noccasionally speculated as to what success she had met and why she had\r\nnot put in ah appearance on her return voyage, but generally dismissed\r\nthe subject by saying that she must have been in too great a hurry to\r\nget south, as any one having a chance to leave that forsaken country\r\nnaturally would be.  But the \"Sea Bee\" had not gone to the southward,\r\nnor was there any likelihood of her doing so for many long months to\r\ncome.\r\n\r\nOn one of the mildest of these October days, when the sunshine still\r\nheld a trace of its summer warmth, a solitary figure stood on the crest\r\nof a bald headland, some hundreds of miles to the north of Battle\r\nHarbour, gazing wistfully out over the lead-coloured waters that came\r\nleaping and snarling towards the red rocks far beneath him.  He had on\r\ngreat sea boots that stood sadly in need of mending, and was clad in\r\nheavy woollens, faded and worn, that showed many a rent and patch.  As\r\nhe leaned on the stout staff that had assisted him in climbing, his\r\nfigure seemed bent as though by age, but when he lifted his, face,\r\ntanned brown by long exposure, the downy moustache on his upper lip\r\nproclaimed his youth.  Altogether the change in his appearance was so\r\ngreat that his most intimate friend would hardly have recognised in him\r\nthe youth who had been called the best dressed man in the T. I. class\r\nof '99 a few months earlier.  But the voice with which he finally broke\r\nthe silence of his long reverie was unmistakably that of Cabot Grant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A solitary figure stood on the crest of a bald headland.]\r\n\r\n\"Heigh ho!\" he sighed, as he cast a sweeping glance over the widespread\r\nwaste of waters on which nothing floated save a few belated icebergs,\r\nand then inland over weary miles of desolate upland barrens, treeless,\r\nmoss-covered, and painfully rugged.  \"It is tough luck to be shut up\r\nhere like birds in a cage, with no chance of the door being opened\r\nbefore next summer.  It is tougher on Baldwin, though, than on me, and\r\nif he can stand it I guess I can.  But I suppose I might as well be\r\ngetting back or he will be worrying about me.\"\r\n\r\nThus saying, Cabot picked up a canvas bag that lay at his feet and\r\nmoved slowly away.\r\n\r\nA very serious misfortune had befallen our lads, and for more than a\r\nmonth the \"Sea Bee,\" though still afloat and as sound as ever, had been\r\nunable to move from the position she now occupied.  After leaving\r\nBattle Harbour her voyage to the northward had not been more than\r\nordinarily eventful, though subject to many and irritating delays.  Not\r\nonly had there been adverse winds, but she had twice been stormbound\r\nfor days in harbours to which she had run for shelter.  Then, too,\r\nWhite had insisted on stopping at every settlement that promised a\r\nchance for trading, and had even run fifty miles up Hamilton Inlet with\r\nthe hope of finding customers for his goods at the half-breed village\r\nof Rigoulette.  But he had always been disappointed.  Either his goods\r\nwere not in demand, or those who desired them had nothing to offer in\r\nexchange but fish, which he did not care to take.  And always he was\r\ntold of a scarcity of food still farther north.  So the voyage had been\r\ncontinued in that direction along a coast that ever grew wilder,\r\ngrander, and more inhospitable.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Cabot was delighted at the opportunities thus given him\r\nfor getting acquainted with the country, and made short exploring trips\r\nfrom every port at which they touched.  From some of these he came back\r\nsadly bitten by the insect pests of the interior, and from others he\r\nbrought quantities of blueberries, pigeon berries that looked and\r\ntasted like wild cranberries, or yellow, raspberry-like \"bake apples,\"\r\nresembling the salmon berries of Alaska.  Also he picked up numerous\r\nrock and mineral specimens that he afterwards carefully labelled.\r\n\r\nFinally, when they had passed the last fishing station of which they\r\nhad any knowledge, and had only the missions to look forward to, they\r\nwere overtaken, while far out at sea, by a furious gale that sorely\r\nbuffeted them for twenty-four hours, and, in spite of their strenuous\r\nefforts, drove them towards the coast.  The gale was accompanied by\r\nstinging sleet and blinding snow squalls, and at length blew with such\r\nviolence that they could no longer show the smallest patch of canvas.\r\n\r\nIn this emergency White constructed a sea anchor, by means of which he\r\nhoped to prolong their struggle for at least a few hours.  It was\r\nhardly got overboard, however, before a giant surge snapped its cable\r\nand hurled the little craft helplessly towards the crash and smother\r\nwith which the furious seas warred against an iron coast.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the other perils surrounding our lads, the gloom of\r\nimpending night was upon them, and they could only dimly distinguish\r\nthe towering cliffs against which they expected shortly to be dashed.\r\nBoth of them stood by the tiller, grimly silent, and using the last of\r\ntheir strength to keep their craft head on, for in the trough of that\r\nawful sea she would have rolled over like a log.  Neither of them\r\nflinched nor showed a sign of fear, though both fully realised the fate\r\nawaiting them.\r\n\r\nAt last, with the send of a giant billow, the little schooner was flung\r\nbodily into the roaring whiteness, and, with hearts that seemed already\r\nto have ceased their beating, the poor lads braced themselves for the\r\nfinal shock.  To their unbounded amazement the \"Sea Bee,\" instead of\r\ndashing against the cliffs, appeared to pass directly into them as\r\nthough they were but shadows of a solid substance, and in another\r\nminute had shot, like an arrow from a bow, through a rift barely wide\r\nenough to afford her passage.\r\n\r\nAs her stupefied crew slowly realised that a reprieve from death had\r\nbeen granted at the last moment, they also became aware that they were\r\nin a place of absolute darkness, and, save for the muffled outside roar\r\nof furious seas, of absolute quiet.  At the same time they were so\r\nexhausted after their recent prolonged struggle that they found barely\r\nstrength to get overboard an anchor.  Then, careless of everything\r\nelse, they tumbled into their bunks for the rest and sleep they so\r\nsadly needed.\r\n\r\nWhen they next awoke it was broad daylight, and their first move was to\r\nhasten on deck for a view of their surroundings.  Their craft lay as\r\nmotionless as a painted ship, in the middle of a placid pool black as a\r\nhighland tarn.  In no place was it more than a pistol shot in width,\r\nand it was enclosed by precipitous cliffs that towered hundreds of feet\r\nabove her.  The schooner could not have been more happily located by\r\none possessed of an absolute knowledge of the coast under the most\r\nfavourable conditions, and that she should have come there as she had\r\nwas nothing short of a miracle.\r\n\r\nFilled with thankfulness for their marvellous escape the lads gazed\r\nabout them curious to discover by what means they had gained this haven\r\nof refuge.  On three sides they could see only the grim fronts of\r\ninaccessible cliffs.  On the fourth was a strip of beach and a cleft\r\nthrough which poured a plume-like waterfall white as a wreath of driven\r\nsnow.\r\n\r\n\"Did we come in that way?\" asked Cabot, pointing to this torrent of\r\nsilver spray.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose we must have,\" rejoined White soberly; \"for I can't see any\r\nother opening, and it certainly felt last night as though we were\r\nsailing over the brink of a dozen waterfalls.  But let's get breakfast,\r\nfor I'm as hungry as a wolf.  Then there'll be time enough to find out\r\nhow we got in here, as well as how we are to get out again.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a hearty meal they got the dinghy overboard and started on a tour\r\nof exploration.  First they visited the beach and found a rude pathway\r\nleading up beside the waterfall that promised exit from the basin to an\r\nactive climber.\r\n\r\n\"In spite of all the wonderful happenings of last night I don't believe\r\nwe came in that way,\" said Cabot.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" laughed White, \"the old 'Bee's' wings aren't quite strong enough\r\nfor that yet, though there's no saying what she may do with practice.\"\r\n\r\nSatisfied that there was no outlet for a sailing craft in this\r\ndirection, they pulled towards the opposite side of the basin, but not\r\nuntil they were within a few rods of its cliffs did they discover an\r\nopening which was so black with shadow that it had heretofore escaped\r\ntheir notice.\r\n\r\n\"Here it is,\" cried Cabot, \"though----\"\r\n\r\nHis speech was cut suddenly short, and for a moment he stared in silent\r\namazement.  The farther end of the passage was completely filled by\r\nwhat appeared a gigantic mass of white rock.\r\n\r\n\"An iceberg!\" exclaimed the young skipper, who was the first to\r\nrecognise the true nature of the obstacle.  \"An iceberg driven in by\r\nthe gale and jammed.  Now we are in a fix.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should say as much,\" responded Cabot, \"for there isn't space enough\r\nto let a rowboat out, much less a schooner.  No wonder this water is as\r\nstill as that in a corked bottle.  What shall we do now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait until it melts, I suppose,\" replied White gloomily, \"or until the\r\noutside seas batter it away.\"\r\n\r\nSo our lads had waited unhappily and impatiently for more than a month,\r\nand still the ice barrier was as immovable as ever.  Also, as the\r\nweather was growing steadily cooler, its melting became less and less\r\nwith each succeeding day.\r\n\r\nDuring this period of enforced imprisonment they had made several\r\nexploring trips into the interior, but had failed to find trace of\r\nhuman life; nor were they able to go far either north or south on\r\naccount of impassable waterways.  Neither could they discover any\r\ntimber from which to obtain firewood, and as the supply on the schooner\r\nwas nearly exhausted their outlook for the future grew daily more and\r\nmore gloomy.\r\n\r\nFor a while they had hoped to signal some passing vessel, and one or\r\nthe other of them made daily trips to the most prominent headland of\r\nthe vicinity, where he kept a lookout for hours.  But this also proved\r\nfruitless, for but two vessels had been sighted, and neither of these\r\npaid any attention to their signals.\r\n\r\nThus the open season passed, and with the near approach of an Arctic\r\nwinter the situation of our imprisoned lads grew so desperate that they\r\nwere filled with the gloomiest forebodings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nFIRST ENCOUNTER WITH THE NATIVES.\r\n\r\nOnly once during their tedious imprisonment had our lads received\r\nevidence that human beings existed in that desolate country, and after\r\nthey gained this information they hardly knew whether to rejoice or to\r\nregret that it had come to them.  One morning, some weeks after their\r\narrival in the basin, to which they had given the name of \"Locked\r\nHarbour,\" Cabot, going on deck for a breath of air, made a discovery so\r\nstartling that, for a moment, he could hardly credit the evidence of\r\nhis eyes.  Then he shouted to White:\r\n\r\n\"Come up here quick, old man, and take in the sight.\"\r\n\r\nAs the latter, who had been lighting a fire in the galley stove, obeyed\r\nthis call, Cabot pointed to the beach, on which stood a row of human\r\nfigures, gazing at the schooner as stolidly as so many graven images.\r\n\r\n\"Indians!\" cried White, \"and perhaps we can get them to show us the way\r\nto the nearest mission.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good enough!\" rejoined Cabot in high excitement.  \"Let's go ashore and\r\ninterview them before they have a chance to disappear as mysteriously\r\nas they have appeared.  Where do you suppose they came from?\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't imagine, and doubt if they'll ever tell.  Probably they are\r\nwondering the same thing about us.  I suppose, though, they are on\r\ntheir way towards the interior for the winter.  But hold on a minute.\r\nWe must take them some sort of a present.  Grub is what they'll be most\r\nlikely to appreciate, for the natives of this country are always\r\nhungry.\"\r\n\r\nActing upon his own suggestion, White dived below, to reappear a minute\r\nlater with a bag of biscuit and a generous piece of salt pork, which he\r\ntossed into the dinghy.  Then the excited lads pulled for the beach on\r\nwhich the strangers still waited in motionless expectation.\r\n\r\n\"Only a woman, a baby, and three children,\" remarked White, in a tone\r\nof disappointment, as they approached near enough to scrutinise the\r\ngroup.  \"Still, I suppose they can guide us out of here as well as any\r\none else if they only will.\"\r\n\r\nThe strangers were as White had discovered--a woman and children, but\r\none of these latter was a half-grown boy of such villainous appearance\r\nthat Cabot promptly named him \"Arsenic,\" because his looks were enough\r\nto poison anything.  They were clad in rags, and were so miserably thin\r\nthat they had evidently been on short rations for a long time.  White's\r\nbelief that they were hungry was borne out by the ravenous manner with\r\nwhich they fell upon the provisions he presented to them.\r\n\r\nArsenic seized the piece of pork and whipping out a knife cut it into\r\nstrips, which he, his mother, and his sisters devoured raw, as though\r\nit were a delicacy to which they had long been strangers.  The hard\r\nbiscuit also made a magical disappearance, and when all were gone,\r\nArsenic, looking up with a hideous grin, uttered the single word:\r\n\"More.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good!\" cried Cabot, \"he can talk English.  Now look here, young man,\r\nif we give you more--all you can carry, in fact, of pork, bread, flour,\r\ntea, and sugar, will you show us the road to the nearest\r\nmission--Ramah, Nain, or Hopedale?\"\r\n\r\n\"Tea, shug,\" replied the boy, with an expectant grin.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, tea, sugar, and a lot of other things if you'll show us the way\r\nto Nain.  You understand?\"\r\n\r\n\"Tea, shug,\" repeated the young Indian, again grinning.\r\n\r\n\"We wantee git topside Nain.  You sabe, Nain?\" asked Cabot, pointing to\r\nhis companion and himself, and then waving his hand comprehensively at\r\nthe inland landscape.\r\n\r\n\"Tea, shug, more,\" answered the young savage, promptly, while his\r\nrelatives regarded him admiringly as one who had mastered the art of\r\nconversing with foreigners.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps he understands English better, or rather more, than he speaks\r\nit,\" suggested White.\r\n\r\n\"It is to be hoped that he does,\" replied Cabot.  \"Even then he might\r\nnot comprehend more than one word in a thousand.  But I tell you what.\r\nLet's go and get our own breakfast, pack up what stuff we intend to\r\ncarry, make the schooner as snug as possible, and come back to the\r\nbeach.  Here we'll show these beggars what stuff we've brought, and\r\ngive them to understand that it shall all be theirs when they get us to\r\nNain.  Then we'll start them up the trail, and follow wherever they\r\nlead.  They are bound to fetch up somewhere.  Even if they don't take\r\nus where we want to go, we will have provisions enough to last us a\r\nweek or more, and can surely find our way back.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hate to leave them, for they might skip out while we were gone,\"\r\nobjected White.\r\n\r\n\"That's so.  Well then, why not invite them on board?  They'll be safe\r\nthere until we are ready to go.  Say, Arsenic, you all come with we all\r\nto shipee, sabe?  Get tea, sugar, plenty, eat heap, you understand?\"\r\n\r\nAs Cabot said this he made motions for all the natives to enter the\r\ndinghy, and then pointed to the schooner.\r\n\r\nIt was evident that he was understood, and equally so that the woman\r\ndeclined his proposition, for she sat motionless, holding her baby, and\r\nwith the younger children close by her side.  The boy, however,\r\nexpressed his willingness to visit the schooner by entering the dinghy\r\nand seating himself in its stern.\r\n\r\n\"That will do,\" said White.  \"The others won't run away without him,\r\nand he is the only one we want anyhow.\"\r\n\r\nSo the boat was rowed out to the anchored schooner, while those left on\r\nthe beach watched the departure of their son and brother with the same\r\napathy that they had shown towards all the other happenings of that\r\neventful morning.\r\n\r\n\"Look at the young scarecrow, taking things as coolly as though he had\r\nalways been used to having white men row him about a harbour,\" laughed\r\nCabot, \"and yet I don't suppose he was ever in a regular boat before.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" agreed White, \"I don't suppose he ever was.\"\r\n\r\nThey did not allow Arsenic to enter the \"Sea Bee's\" cabin, but made him\r\nstay on deck, where, however, he appeared perfectly contented and at\r\nhis ease.  Here Cabot brought the various supplies for their proposed\r\njourney and put them up in neat packages while White prepared\r\nbreakfast.  The former had supposed that their guest would be greatly\r\ninterested in what he was doing, but the young savage manifested the\r\nutmost indifference to all that took place.  In fact he seemed to pay\r\nno attention to Cabot's movements, but squatted on the deck, and gazed\r\nin silent meditation at the beach, where his mother and sisters could\r\nbe seen also seated in motionless expectation.\r\n\r\n\"I believe he is a perfect idiot,\" muttered Cabot, \"and wonder that he\r\nknows enough to eat when he's hungry.\"\r\n\r\nThen White called him, and he went below to breakfast.\r\n\r\n\"Do you think it is safe to leave that chap alone on deck with all\r\nthose things?\" asked the former.\r\n\r\n\"Take a look at him and see for yourself,\" replied Cabot.\r\n\r\nSo White crept noiselessly up the companion ladder and peeped\r\ncautiously out.  Arsenic still squatted where Cabot had left him,\r\ngazing idiotically off into space.  At the same time a close observer\r\nmight have imagined that his beady eyes twinkled with a gleam of\r\ninterest as White's head appeared above the companion coaming.\r\n\r\n\"I guess it is all right,\" said White, rejoining his friend.\r\n\r\n\"Of course it is.  He couldn't swim ashore with the things, and there\r\nisn't any other way he could make off with them, except by taking them\r\nin the dinghy, and that chump couldn't any more manage a boat than a\r\ncow.\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of this assertion Cabot finished his meal with all speed, and\r\nthen hurried on deck, where he uttered a cry of dismay.  A single\r\nglance showed him that their guest, together with all the supplies\r\nprepared for their journey, was no longer where he had left him.  A\r\nsecond glance disclosed the dinghy half way to the beach, while in her\r\nstern, sculling her swiftly along with practised hand, stood the\r\nwooden-headed young savage who didn't know how to manage a boat.\r\n\r\n\"Come back here, you sneak thief, or I'll fill you full of lead,\"\r\nyelled Cabot, and as the Indian paid not the slightest attention he\r\ndrew his revolver and fired.  He never knew where the bullet struck,\r\nbut it certainly did not reach the mark he intended, for Arsenic merely\r\nincreased the speed of his boat without even looking back.\r\n\r\nSo angry that he hardly realised what he was doing, Cabot cocked his\r\npistol and attempted to fire again, but the lock only snapped\r\nharmlessly, and there was no report.  Then he remembered that he had\r\nexpended several shots the day before in a fruitless effort to attract\r\nattention on board a distant vessel seen from the lookout, and had\r\nneglected to reload.\r\n\r\nAs he started for the cabin in quest of more cartridges he came into\r\ncollision with White hurrying on deck.\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter?\" inquired the latter, as soon as he regained the\r\nbreath thus knocked out of him.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, nothing at sill,\" replied Cabot, with ironical calmness, \"only\r\nwe've been played for a couple of hayseeds by a wooden-faced young\r\nheathen who don't know enough to go in when it rains.  In his childish\r\nfolly he has gone off with the dinghy, taking our provisions along as a\r\nsouvenir of his visit, and he didn't even have the politeness to look\r\nround when I spoke to him.  Oh! but it will be a chilly day for little\r\nWilly if I catch him again.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am glad you only spoke,\" remarked White.  \"When I heard you shoot I\r\ndidn't know but what you had murdered him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wish I had,\" growled Cabot, savagely.  \"Look at him now, and consider\r\nthe cheek of the plain, every-day North American savage.\"\r\n\r\nIt was aggravating to see the young thief gain the beach and lift from\r\nthe boat the provisions he had so deftly acquired.  It was even more\r\nannoying to see the embryo warrior's grateful family pounce upon the\r\nprizes of his bow and spear, and to be forced to listen to the joyous\r\ncries with which they greeted their returned hero.  Filled now with a\r\nbustling activity, the Indians quickly divided the spoil according to\r\ntheir strength; and then, without one backward glance, or a single look\r\ntowards the schooner, they started up the narrow trail by the\r\nwaterfall, with the triumphant Arsenic heading the procession, and in\r\nanother minute had disappeared.\r\n\r\nAs the last fluttering rag vanished from sight, our lads, who had\r\nwatched the latter part of this performance in silent wrath, turned to\r\neach other and burst out laughing.\r\n\r\n\"It was a dirty, mean, low-down trick!\" cried Cabot.  \"At the same time\r\nhe played it with a dexterity that compels my admiration.  Now, what\r\nshall we do?\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose one of us will have to swim ashore and get that boat.\"\r\n\r\n\"What, through ice water?  You are right, though, and as I am the\r\nbiggest chump, I'll go.\"\r\n\r\nCabot was as good as his word, and did swim to the beach, though, as he\r\nafterwards said, he did not know whether his first plunge was made into\r\nice water or molten lead.  Then he and White followed the trail of\r\ntheir recent guests to the crest of the bluffs, but could not discover\r\nwhat direction they had taken from that point.  So they returned to the\r\nschooner sadder but wiser than before, and wondered whether they were\r\nbetter or worse off on account of the recent visitation.\r\n\r\n\"If they carry news of us to one of the missions we will be better\r\noff,\" argued Cabot.\r\n\r\n\"But, if they don't, we are worse off, by at least the value of our\r\nstolen provisions,\" replied White.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nA MELANCHOLY SITUATION.\r\n\r\nIn Labrador, under ordinary circumstances, the loss of such a quantity\r\nof provisions as Arsenic had carried away would have been a very\r\nserious misfortune.  But food was the one thing our lads had in\r\nabundance, and they were more unhappy at having lost a guide, who might\r\nhave shown them a way out of their prison, than over the theft he had\r\nso successfully accomplished.\r\n\r\n\"The next time we catch an Indian we'll tie a string to him,\" said\r\nCabot.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" agreed White, \"and it will be a stout one, too; but I am afraid\r\nthere won't be any more Indians on the coast this season.\"\r\n\r\n\"How about Eskimo?\"\r\n\r\n\"Some of them may come along later, when the snowshoeing and sledging\r\nget good enough, for they are apt to travel pretty far south during the\r\nwinter.  Still, there's no knowing how far back from the coast their\r\nline of travel may lie at this point, and dozens of them might pass\r\nwithout our knowledge.\"\r\n\r\n\"Couldn't we go up or down the coast as well as an Eskimo, whenever\r\nthese miserable waterways freeze over?\" asked Cabot.\r\n\r\n\"Of course, if we had sledges, dogs, snowshoes, and fur clothing,\"\r\nreplied White; \"but without all these things we might just as well\r\ncommit suicide before starting.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'll tell you what we can do right off, and the sooner we set\r\nabout it the better.  We can go inland as far as possible, and leave a\r\nline of flags or some sort of signals that will attract attention to\r\nthis place.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know but what that is a good idea,\" remarked White,\r\nthoughtfully.  \"At any rate, it would be better than doing nothing, and\r\nif we don't get help in some way we shall certainly freeze to death in\r\nthis place long before the winter is over.\"\r\n\r\nSo Cabot's suggestion was adopted, and the remainder of that day was\r\nspent in preparing little flags of red and white cloth, attaching them\r\nto slender sticks, and in making a number of wooden arrows.  On a\r\nsmooth side of these they wrote:\r\n\r\n\"Help!  We are stranded on the coast.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish we could write it in Eskimo and Indian,\" said Cabot, \"for\r\nEnglish doesn't seem to be the popular language of this country.\"\r\n\r\n\"The flags and arrows will be a plain enough language for any natives\r\nwho may run across them,\" responded White, \"and I only hope they'll see\r\nthem; but it is a slim chance, and we'll probably be frozen stiff long\r\nbefore any one finds us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I don't know,\" said Cabot, cheerfully.  \"There's firewood enough\r\nin the schooner itself to last quite a while.\"\r\n\r\n\"Burn the 'Sea Bee'!\" cried White, aghast at the suggestion.  \"I\r\ncouldn't do it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Neither could I at present; but I expect both of us could and would,\r\nlong before our blood reached the freezing point.\"\r\n\r\n\"But if we destroyed the schooner, how would we get out of here next\r\nsummer?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure I don't know, and don't care to try and think yet a while.\r\nJust now I am much more interested in the nearby winter than in a very\r\ndistant summer.\"\r\n\r\nThe next day, and for a number of days thereafter, our lads worked at\r\nthe establishment of their signal line.  They erected stone cairns at\r\nsuch distances apart that every one was visible from those on either\r\nside, and on the summit of each they planted a flag with its\r\naccompanying pointer.  In this way they ran an unbroken range of\r\nsignals for ten miles, and would have carried it further had they dared\r\nexpend any more of their precious firewood.\r\n\r\nWhile they were engaged upon this task the weather became noticeably\r\ncolder, the mercury falling below the freezing point each night, and\r\nthe whole country was wrapped in the first folds of the snow blanket\r\nunder which it would sleep for months.  About the time their signal\r\nline was completed, however, there came a milder day, so suggestive of\r\nthe vanished summer that Cabot declared his intention of spending an\r\nhour or so at the lookout.  \"There might be such a thing as a belated\r\nvessel,\" he argued, \"and I might have the luck to signal it.  Anyhow, I\r\nam going to make one more try before agreeing to settle down here for\r\nthe winter.\"\r\n\r\nAs White was busy moving the galley stove into the cabin, and making\r\nother preparations for their coming struggle against Arctic cold, Cabot\r\nrowed himself ashore and left the dinghy on the beach.  Then he climbed\r\nto the summit of the lofty headland, where, for a long time, he leaned\r\nthoughtfully on the rude Alpine-stock that had aided his steps, and\r\ngazed out over the vacant ocean.\r\n\r\nWhile Cabot thus watched for ships that failed to come, White was\r\nputting the finishing touches to his new cabin fixtures.  He was just\r\nbeginning to wonder if it were not time for his comrade's return when\r\nhe felt the slight jar of some floating object striking against the\r\nside of the schooner.  Thinking that Cabot had arrived, he shouted a\r\ncheery greeting, but turned to survey the general effect of what he had\r\ndone before going on deck.  The next minute some one softly entered the\r\ncabin and sprang upon the unsuspecting youth, overpowering him and\r\nflinging him to the floor before he had a chance to offer resistance.\r\nHere he was securely bound and left to make what he could of the\r\nsituation, while his captors swarmed through the schooner with\r\nexclamations of delight at the richness of their prize.\r\n\r\nAs White slowly recovered from the bewilderment of his situation he saw\r\nthat his assailants were Indians, and even recognised in one of them\r\nthe hideous features of the lad whom Cabot had named Arsenic.\r\n\r\n\"What fools we have been,\" he thought, bitterly.  \"We might have known\r\nthat he would come back with the first band of his friends that he ran\r\nacross.  And to make sure that they would find us we filled the country\r\nwith sign posts all pointing this way.  Seems to me that was about as\r\nidiotic a thing as we could have done, and if ever a misfortune was\r\ndeserved this one is.  I wonder what has become of Cabot, and if they\r\nhave caught him yet.  I only hope he won't try to fight 'em, for they'd\r\njust as soon kill him as not.  Probably they'll kill us both, though,\r\nso that no witnesses can ever appear against them.  Poor chap!  It was\r\na sad day for him when he attempted to help a fellow as unlucky as I am\r\nout of his troubles.  Now I wonder what's up.\"\r\n\r\nA shrill cry of triumph had come from the shore, and the savages on the\r\nschooner's deck were replying to it with exultant yells.\r\n\r\nThe cry from shore announced the capture of Cabot by two Indians who\r\nhad been left behind for that express purpose.  Of course the\r\nnew-comers had known as soon as they discovered the dinghy that at\r\nleast one of the schooner's defenders was on shore, and had made their\r\narrangements accordingly.  As we have seen, the naval contingent\r\nexperienced no difficulty in capturing the schooner, and a little later\r\nthe land forces carried out their part of the programme with equal\r\nfacility.  They merely hid themselves behind some boulders, and leaping\r\nout upon the young American, as he came unsuspectingly swinging down\r\nthe trail, overpowered him before he could make a struggle.  Tying him\r\nbeyond a possibility of escape, they carried him down to the beach,\r\nwhere they uttered the cries that informed their comrades of their\r\ntriumph.\r\n\r\nUntil this time the schooner had been left at her anchorage, for fear\r\nlest any change in her position might arouse Cabot's suspicions.  Now\r\nthat they were free to do as they pleased with her the Indians cut her\r\ncable, and, after much awkward effort, succeeded in towing her to the\r\nbeach, where they made her fast.\r\n\r\nAs the darkness and cold of night were now upon them, and as they had\r\nno longer any use for the dinghy, they smashed it in pieces and started\r\na fire with its shattered timbers.  At the same time they broke out\r\nseveral barrels of provisions, and the entire band, gathering about the\r\nfire, began to feast upon their contents.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Cabot and White, in their respective places of\r\ncaptivity, were equally miserable through their ignorance of what had\r\nhappened to each other, and of the fate awaiting them.  Of course Cabot\r\nhad seen the schooner brought to the beach, while White, still lying on\r\nher cabin floor, was able to guess at her position from such sounds as\r\ncame to his ears.\r\n\r\nDuring that eventful afternoon, while the savages were still preparing\r\nthe plan that had resulted in such complete success, a white man,\r\nsetting a line of traps for fur-bearing animals, had run across the\r\noutermost of the signals established by our lads a few days earlier.\r\nIts fluttering pennon had attracted his attention while he was still at\r\na distance, and, filled with curiosity, he had gone to it for a closer\r\nexamination.  On reaching the signal he read the pencilled writing on\r\nits arrow, and then stood irresolute, evidently much perturbed, for\r\nseveral minutes.  Finally, heaving a great sigh, he set forth in the\r\ndirection indicated by the arrow.\r\n\r\nHe was a gigantic man, and presented a strange spectacle as he strode\r\nswiftly across the country with the long, sliding gait of a practised\r\nsnowshoer.  Although his wide-set blue eyes were frank and gentle in\r\nexpression, a heavy mass of blonde hair, streaming over his shoulders\r\nlike a mane, and a shaggy beard, gave him an air of lion-like ferocity.\r\nThis wildness of aspect, as well as his huge proportions, were both\r\nincreased by his garments, which were entirely of wolf skins.  Even his\r\ncap was of this material, ornamented by a wolf's tail that streamed out\r\nbehind and adorned in front with a pair of wolf ears pricked sharply\r\nforward.  He carried a rifle and bore on his shoulders, as though it\r\nwere a feather weight, a pack of such size than an ordinarily strong\r\nman would have found difficulty in lifting it.\r\n\r\nAs this remarkable stranger, looking more like a Norse war god than a\r\nmere human being, reached one signal after another, he passed it\r\nwithout pausing for examination until he had gained a point about half\r\nway to the coast.  Then he came to an abrupt halt and studied the\r\nsurrounding snow intently.  He had run across the trail made by Arsenic\r\nand his fellows a few hours earlier.  After an examination of the\r\nsprawling footprints, the big man uttered a peculiar snort of\r\nsatisfaction, and again pushed on with increased speed.  An hour later\r\nhe stood, concealed by darkness, on the verge of the cliffs enclosing\r\nLocked Harbour, gazing interestedly down on the fire-lit beach, the\r\nhalf-revealed schooner, the feasting savages, and the recumbent, dimly\r\ndiscerned figure of Cabot Grant, their prisoner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nCOMING OF THE MAN-WOLF.\r\n\r\nOnce Arsenic went to where Cabot was lying, and, grinning cheerfully,\r\nremarked: \"Tea, shug.  Plenty, yes.\"  Then he laughed immoderately, as\r\ndid several other Indians who were listening admiringly to this flight\r\nof eloquence in the white man's own tongue.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, clear out, you grinning baboon,\" growled Cabot.  \"I only hope I'll\r\nlive to get even with you for this day's work.\"\r\n\r\nThe Indians were evidently so pleased at having drawn a retort from\r\ntheir prisoner that he declined to gratify them further, or to speak\r\nanother word, though for some time Arsenic continued to beguile him\r\nwith his tiresome \"Tea, shug,\" etc.  When the latter finally gave it up\r\nand started away to get his share of the feast, Cabot's gaze followed\r\nhim closely.\r\n\r\nAll this time our lad was filled with vague terrors concerning White,\r\nof whose fate he had not received the slightest intimation, as well as\r\nof what might be in store for himself.  Would he be carried to the\r\ndistant interior to become a slave in some filthy Indian village, or\r\nwould he be killed before they took their departure?  Perhaps they\r\nwould simply leave him there to freeze and starve to death, or they\r\nmight amuse themselves by burning him at the stake.  Did these far\r\nnorthern Indians still do such things?  He wondered, but could not\r\nremember ever to have heard.\r\n\r\nWhile considering these unpleasant possibilities, Cabot was also\r\nsuffering with cold, from the pain of his bonds, and from lying\r\nmotionless on the bed of rocks to which he had been carelessly flung.\r\nBut, with all his pain and his mental distress, he still glared at the\r\nyoung savage who had so basely betrayed his kindness, and at length\r\nArsenic seemed to be uneasily aware of the steady gaze.  He changed his\r\nposition several times, and his noisy hilarity was gradually succeeded\r\nby a sullen silence.  Suddenly he lifted his head and listened\r\napprehensively.  His quick ear had caught an ominous note in the\r\ndistant, long-drawn howl of a wolf.  He spoke of it to his comrades,\r\nand several of them joined him in listening.  It came again, a\r\nblood-curdling yell, now so distinct that all heard it.  They stopped\r\ntheir feasting to consult in low tones and peer fearfully into the\r\nsurrounding blackness.\r\n\r\nCabot had also recognised the sound, but, uncanny as it was, he\r\nwondered why the howl of a wolf should disturb a lot of Indians who\r\nmust know, even better than he, the cowardly nature of the beast, and\r\nthat there was no chance of his coming near a fire.\r\n\r\nEven as these thoughts passed through his mind, the terrible cry was\r\nuttered again--this time so close at hand that it was taken up and\r\nrepeated by a chorus of echoes from the nearby cliffs.  The Indians\r\nsprang to their feet in terror, while at the same moment an avalanche\r\nof stones, gravel, and small boulders rushed down the face of the cliff\r\nclose to where Cabot lay.  From it was evolved a monstrous shape that,\r\nwith unearthly howlings, leaped towards the frightened natives.  As it\r\ndid so flashes of lightning, that seemed to dart from it, gleamed with\r\na dazzling radiance on their distorted faces.  In another moment they\r\nwere in full flight up the rugged pathway leading from the basin, hotly\r\npursued by their mysterious enemy.\r\n\r\nThe latter seemed to pass directly through the fire, scattering its\r\nblazing brands to all sides.  At the same time he snatched up a flaming\r\ntimber for use as a weapon against such of the panic-stricken savages\r\nas still remained within reach.\r\n\r\nThe flashes of light that accompanied the apparition, while\r\nilluminating all nearby objects, had left it shrouded in darkness, and\r\nonly when it crouched for an instant above the fire did Cabot gain a\r\nclear glimpse of the gigantic form.  To his dismay it appeared to be a\r\ngreat beast with a human resemblance.  It had the gleaming teeth, the\r\nhorrid jaws, the sharp ears, in fact the face and head of a wolf, the\r\ntawny mane of a lion, and was covered with thick fur; but it stood\r\nerect and used its arms like a man.  At the same time, the sounds\r\nissuing from its throat seemed a combination of incoherent human cries\r\nand wolfish howlings.  Cabot only saw it for a moment, and then it was\r\ngone, leaping up the pathway, whirling the blazing timber above its\r\nhead, and darting its mysterious lightning flashes after the flying\r\nIndians.\r\n\r\nAs the clamour of flight and pursuit died away, to be followed by a\r\nprofound silence, there came a muffled call:\r\n\r\n\"Cabot.  Cabot Grant.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hello!\" shouted our lad.  \"Who is it?  Where are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is I, White,\" came the barely heard answer.  \"I am here in the\r\ncabin.  Can't you come and let me out?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied Cabot.  \"I am tied hand and foot.\"\r\n\r\n\"So am I.  Are you wounded?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.  Are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.  What are the Indians doing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Running for dear life from a Labrador devil--half wolf and half\r\nman--armed with soundless thunder-bolts.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the short silence that followed, White meditated upon this\r\nextraordinary statement, and decided that his comrade's brain must be\r\naffected by his sufferings.\r\n\r\n\"If I could only twist out of these ropes,\" he groaned, and then he\r\nbegan again a struggle to free his hands from their bonds.  At the same\r\ntime Cabot, who had long since discovered the futility of such effort,\r\nwas anxiously listening, and wondering what would happen next.\r\n\r\nWith all his listening he did not hear the soft approach of furred\r\nfootsteps, and when a blinding light was flashed full in his face he\r\nwas so startled that he cried out with terror.  Instantly the light\r\nvanished, and he shuddered as he realised that the furry monster had\r\nreturned, and, bending over him, was fumbling at his bonds.\r\n\r\nIn another moment these were severed, he was picked up as though he had\r\nbeen an infant, and carried to the fire, whose scattered embers were\r\nspeedily re-assembled.  As it blazed up, Cabot gazed eagerly at the\r\nmysterious figure, which had thus far worked in silence.  Curious as he\r\nwas to see it, he yet dreaded to look upon its wolfish features.\r\nTherefore, as the fire blazed up, he uttered a cry of amazement, for,\r\nfully revealed by its light, was a man; clad in furs, it is true, but\r\nbare-headed and having a pleasant face lighted by kindly blue eyes.\r\n\r\n\"You are really human after all!\" gasped Cabot.\r\n\r\nThe stranger smiled but said nothing.\r\n\r\n\"And can understand English?\"\r\n\r\nA nod of the head was the only answer.\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" continued Cabot, hardly noting that his deliverer had not\r\nspoken, \"won't you please go aboard the schooner and find my friend?\r\nHe is in the cabin, where those wretches left him, tied up.\"\r\n\r\nThis was the first intimation the stranger had received that any one\r\nbesides Cabot needed his assistance, but without a word he did as\r\nrequested, swinging himself aboard the \"Sea Bee\" by her head chains and\r\nher bowsprit, which overhung the beach.  Directly afterwards a flash of\r\nlight streamed from the cabin windows.  Then White Baldwin, assisted by\r\nthe fur-clad giant, emerged from his prison, walked stiffly along the\r\ndeck, and was helped down to the beach, where Cabot eagerly awaited him.\r\n\r\nAfter a joyous greeting of his friend the young American said\r\nanxiously: \"But are you sure you are all right, old man--not wounded\r\nnor hurt in any way?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; I am sound as a nut,\" replied White.  \"Only a little stiff, that's\r\nall.\"\r\n\r\n\"Same here,\" declared Cabot, industriously rubbing his legs to restore\r\ntheir circulation.  \"I was rapidly turning into a human icicle, though,\r\nwhen our big friend dropped down from the sky in a chariot of flame and\r\ngave those Indian beggars such a scare that I don't suppose they've\r\nstopped running yet.  But how did you happen to let 'em aboard, old\r\nman?  Couldn't you stand them off with a gun?\"\r\n\r\nFor answer White gave a full account of all that had taken place, so\r\nfar as he knew, and in return Cabot described his own exciting\r\nexperiences, while the stranger listened attentively, but in silence,\r\nto both narratives.  When Cabot came to the end of his own story, he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"Now, sir, won't you please tell us how you happened to find us out and\r\ncome to our rescue just in the nick of time?  I should also very much\r\nlike to know how you managed to tumble down that precipice unharmed, as\r\nwell as how you produced those flashes of light that scared the savages\r\nso badly--me too, for that matter.\"\r\n\r\nFor answer the stranger only smiled gravely, pointed to his lips, and\r\nshook his head.\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" exclaimed both Cabot and White, shocked by this intimation, and\r\nthe former said:\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon, sir.  While I noticed that you didn't do much\r\ntalking, it never occurred to me that you were dumb.  I am awfully\r\nsorry, and it must be a terrible trial.  At the same time, I am glad\r\nyou can hear me say how very grateful we are to you for getting us out\r\nof a nasty fix in the splendid way you did.  Now, I move we adjourn to\r\nthe cabin of the schooner, where we can make some hot tea and be rather\r\nmore comfortable than out here.  That is, if you think those Indians\r\nwon't come back.\"\r\n\r\nThe stranger smiled again, and shook his head so reassuringly that the\r\nlads had no longer a doubt as to the expediency of returning to the\r\ncabin.  There they started a fire in the stove, boiled water, made tea,\r\nand prepared a meal, of which the stranger ate so heartily, and with\r\nsuch evident appreciation, that it was a pleasure to watch him.\r\n\r\nWhile supper was being made ready, the big man removed his outer\r\ngarments of wolf fur and stood in a close-fitting suit of tanned\r\nbuckskin that clearly revealed the symmetry of his massive proportions.\r\n\r\n\"If I were as strong as you look, and, as I know from experience, you\r\nare,\" exclaimed Cabot, admiringly, \"I don't think I would hesitate to\r\nattack a whole tribe of Indians single handed.  My! but it must be fine\r\nto be so strong.\"\r\n\r\nAfter supper Cabot, who generally acted as spokesman, again addressed\r\nhimself to their guest, saying:\r\n\r\n\"If you don't mind, sir, we'd like to have you know just what sort of a\r\npredicament we've got into, and ask your advice as to how we can get\r\nout of it.\"  With this preamble Cabot explained the whole situation,\r\nand ended by saying:\r\n\r\n\"Now you know just how we are fixed, and if you can guide us to the\r\nnearest Mission Station or, if you haven't time to go with us, if you\r\nwill give us directions how to find it--we shall be under a greater\r\nobligation to you than ever.\"\r\n\r\nFor a minute the stranger looked thoughtful but made no sign.  Then,\r\ndipping his finger in a bowl of water, he wrote on the table the single\r\nword: \"To-morrow.\"  Having thus dismissed the subject for the present,\r\nhe stretched his huge frame on a transom and almost instantly fell\r\nasleep.\r\n\r\nOur tired lads were not long in following his example, and, though\r\nseveral times during the alight one or the other of them got up to\r\nreplenish the fire, they always found their guest quietly sleeping.\r\nBut when they both awoke late the following morning and looked for him\r\nhe had disappeared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nA WELCOME MISSIONARY.\r\n\r\nAlthough the outer garments of wolf fur belonging to the mysterious\r\nstranger were also missing, our lads were not at first at all uneasy\r\nconcerning his absence, but imagined that their guest had merely gone\r\nfor a breath of fresh air or to examine the situation of the schooner\r\nby daylight.  So they mended the fire and got breakfast ready,\r\nexpecting with each moment that he would return.  As he did not, Cabot\r\nfinally went on deck to look for him.\r\n\r\nThe morning was bitterly cold, and the harbour was covered with ice\r\nsufficiently strong to bear a man.\r\n\r\n\"The old 'Bee's' found her winter berth at last,\" reflected Cabot, as\r\nhe glanced about him, shivering in the keen air.\r\n\r\nTo his disappointment he could discover no trace of the man upon whom\r\nthey were depending to aid their escape from this icy prison.  Cabot\r\neven dropped to the beach and made his way to the crest of the inland\r\nbluffs, but could see no living thing on all the vast expanse of snow\r\noutspread before him.\r\n\r\n\"I guess he has gone, all right,\" muttered the lad, \"and we are again\r\nleft to our own resources, only a little worse off than we were before.\r\nWhy he came and helped us out at all, though, is a mystery to me.\"\r\n\r\nWith this he retraced his steps and conveyed the unwelcome news to\r\nWhite.\r\n\r\n\"It is evident then,\" said the latter, \"that we must stay here, alive\r\nor dead, all winter.  And I expect we'll be a great deal more dead than\r\nalive long before it is over.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I don't know,\" replied Cabot.  \"This doesn't seem to be such a\r\nvery uninhabited place, after all.  I'm sure we've had a regular job\r\nlot of visitors during the past week, and a good many of them, too.  So\r\nI don't see why we shouldn't have other callers before the winter is\r\nover.  When the next one comes, though, we'll take care and not let him\r\nout of our sight.  Why didn't you tie a string to one of those Indians,\r\nas I advised?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because they tied me first,\" answered White, laughing in spite of his\r\nanxiety.  \"Why didn't you do it yourself?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because all the tying apparatus was aboard the schooner, and I hadn't\r\nso much as a shoe-string about me.  I wish I could have tied that\r\nscoundrel Arsenic, though.  If ever I meet him again I'll try to teach\r\nhim a lesson in gratitude.  But what do you propose to do to-day,\r\nskipper?\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose we might as well unbend and stow our canvas, since the 'Bee'\r\n'll not want to use sails again for a while.  We might also send down\r\ntopmasts, stow away what we can of the running rigging, get those\r\nprovisions on the beach aboard again, and----\"\r\n\r\n\"Hold on!\" cried Cabot, \"you've already laid out all the work I care to\r\ntackle in one day, and if you want any more done you'll have to ship a\r\nnew crew.\"\r\n\r\nIt was well that the lads had ample occupation for that day, otherwise\r\nthey would have been very unhappy.  Even Cabot, for all his assumed\r\ncheerfulness, realised the many dangers with which they were beset.  He\r\nbelieved that their unknown friend had deserted them, and that the\r\nIndians might return at any moment in over-powering numbers.  He knew\r\nthat without outside assistance and guidance it would be impossible to\r\ntraverse the vast frozen wilderness lying between them and\r\ncivilisation.  He knew also that if he and White remained where they\r\nwere they must surely perish before the winter was over.  So the\r\nprospect was far from cheerful, and that evening the \"Sea Bee's\" crew,\r\nwearied with their hard day's work, ate their supper in thoughtful\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\nWhile they were thus engaged both suddenly sprang to their feet with\r\nstartled faces.  A gun had been fired from close at hand, and with its\r\nreport came a confusion of shouts.  Evidently more visitors had\r\narrived; but were they friends or foes?\r\n\r\nWhite thought the latter, and snatched up a loaded revolver, declaring\r\nthat the Indians should not again get possession of his schooner\r\nwithout fighting for it; but Cabot believed the new-comers to be\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\n\"If they were enemies,\" he argued, \"they would have got aboard and\r\ntaken us by surprise before making a sound.\"  So saying he hurried up\r\nthe companionway, with White close at his heels.\r\n\r\n\"Hello!\" shouted Cabot.  \"Who are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"We are friends,\" answered a voice from the beach in English, but with\r\na strong German accent.  \"Can you show us a light?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course we can, and will in a moment,\" replied Cabot joyously.\r\n\"White, get a----\"\r\n\r\nBut White had already darted back into the cabin for a lantern, with\r\nwhich he speedily emerged, and led the way to the beach.  Here our lads\r\nfound a dog sledge with its team, and an Eskimo driver, who was already\r\ncollecting wood for a fire, together with a white man, tall, straight,\r\nmiddle-aged, and wearing a long beard streaked with grey.\r\n\r\n\"God be with you and keep you,\" he said, as he shook hands with Cabot\r\nand White.  \"Where is the captain of this schooner?\"\r\n\r\nCabot pointed to his companion.\r\n\r\n\"Where then is the crew?\"\r\n\r\nAt this both lads laughed, and Cabot replied:\r\n\r\n\"I am the crew.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't mean to tell me that you two boys navigated that vessel to\r\nthis place unaided.\"\r\n\r\n\"We certainly did, sir, though we have not done much navigating for\r\nmore than a month now.  But will you please tell us who you are, where\r\nyou came from, and how you happened to discover us?  Though we are not\r\nsurprised at being discovered, for we seem to be located on a highway\r\nof travel and have visitors nearly every day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed,\" replied the stranger; \"and yet you are stranded in one of the\r\nleast known and most inaccessible bays of the coast.  It is rarely\r\nvisited even by natives, and I doubt if any white man was ever here\r\nbefore your arrival.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then how did you happen to come?\" asked Cabot.\r\n\r\n\"I came by special request to find you and offer whatever assistance I\r\nmay render.  I am the Rev. Ostrander Mellins, Director of a Moravian\r\nMission Station located on the coast some twenty-five miles from this\r\npoint.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how did you know of us?\" cried Cabot, in amazement.  \"We haven't\r\nsent any telegrams nor even written any letters since coming here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did not you send a messenger yesterday?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir.  Most of yesterday we were prisoners in the hands of some\r\nrascally Indians.\"\r\n\r\n\"I perceive,\" said the missionary, \"that I have much to hear as well as\r\nto tell, and, being both tired and cold, would suggest that we seek a\r\nmore sheltered spot than this, where we may converse while my man\r\nprepares supper.\"\r\n\r\nAt these words both our lads were covered with confusion, and, with\r\nprofuse apologies for their lack of hospitality, besought the\r\nmissionary to accompany them into the schooner's cabin.\r\n\r\n\"We should have asked you long ago,\" declared White, \"only we were so\r\novercome with joy at meeting a white man who could talk to us that we\r\nreally didn't know what we were about.\"\r\n\r\n\"Won't your man and dogs also come aboard?\" asked Cabot, anxious to\r\nshow how hospitable they really were.\r\n\r\n\"No, thank you,\" laughed the missionary.  \"They will do very well where\r\nthey are.\"\r\n\r\nIn the cabin, which had never seemed more cheerful and comfortable, the\r\nlads helped the new-comer remove his fur garments, plied him with hot\r\ntea, together with everything they could think of in the way of\r\neatables, and at the same time told him their story as they had told it\r\nto their other guest of the night before.\r\n\r\n\"And you did not send me any message?\" he asked, with a quizzical smile.\r\n\r\n\"I know!\" cried Cabot.  \"It was the man-wolf.  But where did you meet\r\nhim, and why didn't he come back with you?  How did he manage to\r\nexplain the situation?  We thought he couldn't talk.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know that he can,\" replied the missionary, \"for I have never\r\nheard him speak, nor do I know any one who has.  Neither did I meet\r\nhim.  In fact I have never seen him, but I think your messenger must be\r\none and the same with your man-wolf, since he signed his note\r\n'Homolupus.'\"\r\n\r\n\"His note,\" repeated Cabot curiously.  \"Did he send you a note?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not exactly; but he left one for me at a place near the station, where\r\nhe has often left furs to be exchanged for goods, and called my\r\nattention to it by a signal of rifle shots.  When I reached the place I\r\nwas not surprised to find him gone, for he always disappears when it is\r\ncertain that his signal has been understood.  I was, however, greatly\r\nsurprised to find, instead of the usual bundle of furs, only a slip of\r\npaper supported by a cleft stick.  On it was written:\r\n\r\n\"'Schooner laden with provisions stranded in pocket next South of\r\nNukavik Arm.  Crew in distress.  Need immediate assistance.\r\nHomolupus.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"With such a message to urge me, I made instant preparation, and came\r\nhere with all speed.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was awfully good of you,\" said White.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps not quite so good as you may think, since our annual supply\r\nship having thus far failed to make her appearance, the mission is very\r\nshort of provisions, and the intimation that there was an abundance\r\nwithin reach relieved me of a load of anxiety.  So if you are disposed\r\nto sell----\"\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me for interrupting,\" broke in Cabot, \"but, before you get to\r\ntalking business, please tell us something more about the man who sent\r\nyou to our relief.  Who is he?  Where does he live?  What does he look\r\nlike?  Why does he disappear when you go in answer to his signals?  Why\r\ndo you call him a wolf-man?  What----\"\r\n\r\n\"Seems to me that is about as many questions as I can remember at one\r\ntime,\" said the missionary, smiling at Cabot's eagerness, \"and I am\r\nsorry that, with my slight knowledge of the subject, I cannot answer\r\nthem satisfactorily.  The man-wolf was well known to this country\r\nbefore I came to it, which was three years ago, and dwells somewhere to\r\nthe southward of this place, though no one, to my knowledge, has ever\r\nseen his habitation.  Some of the Eskimo can point out its location,\r\nbut they are in such terror of him that they give it a wide berth\r\nwhenever travelling in that direction.  As I said, I have never seen\r\nhim, nor have I ever known of his holding communication other than by\r\nwriting with any human being.  The natives describe him as a man of\r\ngreat size with the head of a wolf.\"\r\n\r\n\"There!  I was sure it wasn't imagination,\" interrupted Cabot\r\nexcitedly.  \"When I first saw him his head and face were those of a\r\nwolf, but the next time they were those of a man, and so I thought I\r\nmust have dreamed the wolf part.  I wonder how he manages it, and I\r\nwish I knew how he produces those lightning flashes.  If this were a\r\nmore civilised part of the world I should say that they resulted from\r\nelectricity--but of course that couldn't be away off here in the\r\nwilderness.  I asked him about them but got no answer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you, then, seen and spoken with him?\" asked the missionary.\r\n\r\n\"Of course we have seen him, for he spent last night in this very\r\ncabin, and we have spoken to him, though not with him, for he is dumb.\"\r\n\r\n\"I envy you the privilege of having met him, and am greatly relieved to\r\nlearn that he is so wholly human; for the natives regard him as either\r\na god or a devil, I can't tell which, and ascribe to him superhuman\r\npowers.  He has righted many a wrong, punished many an evil-doer, saved\r\nmany a poor soul from starvation, and performed innumerable deeds of\r\nkindness.  He dares everything and seems able to do anything.  He is at\r\nonce the guardian angel and the terror of this region, and, on the\r\nwhole, I doubt if there is in all the world to-day a more remarkable\r\nbeing than the man-wolf of Labrador.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nGOOD-BYE TO THE \"SEA BEE.\"\r\n\r\nWhite Baldwin was of course interested in this talk of the man-wolf,\r\nbut he was, at the same time, anxious to hear what the new-comer had to\r\nsay concerning the cargo of provisions for which he had so long sought\r\na purchaser.  His heart beat high with the hope of a speedy return to\r\nhis home and its loved ones; for he had already planned to leave the\r\n\"Sea Bee\" where she was until the following season.  In case he could\r\ndispose of her cargo, he would insist that transportation and a\r\nguide--at least as far as Indian Harbour--should form part of the\r\nbargain.  From Indian Harbour they would surely find some way of\r\ncontinuing the journey.  He might even reach home by Christmas!\r\nWouldn't it be great if he could, and if, at the same time, he could\r\ncarry with him enough money to relieve all present anxieties?  Perhaps\r\nhe might even be able to take his mother and Cola to St. Johns for a\r\nlong visit.  Of course Cabot would accompany them, for with the\r\nwarships all gone south for the winter there would be no danger of\r\narrest, and then he would find out what a splendid city the capital of\r\nNewfoundland really was.  Oh! if they could only start at once; but of\r\ncourse there were certain preliminaries to be settled first, and the\r\nsooner they got at them the better.\r\n\r\nThus thinking, White took advantage of a pause in the conversation to\r\nremark: \"What a very fortunate thing it is that you who want to\r\npurchase provisions and we who have them for sale should come together\r\nin this remarkable fashion.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is so fortunate and so remarkable that I must regard it as a\r\ndistinct leading of the Divine Providence that knows our every need and\r\nguides our halting footsteps,\" replied the missionary.\r\n\r\n\"And do you think,\" continued the young trader anxiously, \"that you\r\nwant our entire cargo?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sure of it; and even then we may be put on short rations before\r\nthe winter is ended, for there are many to be fed.\"\r\n\r\nWith this opening the conversation drifted so easily into business\r\ndetails that, before the occupants of the cabin turned in for the\r\nnight, everything had been arranged.  White had been somewhat\r\ndisappointed when the missionary said that, having no funds in St.\r\nJohns, he would be obliged to give a sight draft on New York in payment\r\nfor the goods.  This slight annoyance was, however, speedily smoothed\r\naway by Cabot, who offered to cash the draft immediately upon their\r\narrival in St. Johns, where, he said, he had ample funds for the\r\npurpose.  It was also agreed that our lads should be provided with fur\r\nclothing, snowshoes, a dog sledge, and a guide as far as Indian\r\nHarbour.  In addition to taking the cargo of the \"Sea Bee,\" the\r\nmissionary proposed to purchase the schooner itself, at a sum much less\r\nthan her real value, but one that constituted a very fair offer under\r\nthe circumstances.\r\n\r\nWhite hesitated over this proposition, but finally accepted it upon\r\ncondition that at any time during the following summer he should be\r\nallowed to buy the schooner back at the same price he now received for\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\"Isn't it fine,\" he whispered to Cabot, after all hands had sought\r\ntheir bunks, \"to think that our venture has turned out so splendidly\r\nafter all?\"\r\n\r\n\"Fine is no name for it,\" rejoined the other.  \"But I do hope we will\r\nhave the chance of meeting Mr. Homolupus once more and of thanking him\r\nfor what he has done.  We owe so much to him that, man-wolf or no\r\nman-wolf, I consider him a splendid fellow.\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of their impatience to start southwards, our lads were still\r\ncompelled to spend two weeks longer at Locked Harbour.  First the\r\nmissionary was obliged to make a visit to his station, and, on his\r\nreturn, the snow was not in condition for a long sledge journey.\r\nFurious winds had piled it into drifts, with intervening spaces of bare\r\nground, over which sledge travel would be impossible.  So they must\r\nwait until the autumnal storms were over and winter had settled down in\r\nearnest.  But, impatient as they were, time no longer hung heavily on\r\ntheir hands, nor did they now regard their place of abode as a prison.\r\nIts solitude and dreariness had fled before the advent of half a\r\nhundred Eskimo--short, squarely built men, moon-faced women, and\r\nroly-poly children, looking like animated balls of fur, all of whom had\r\nbeen brought from the mission to form a settlement on the beach.  It\r\nwas easier to bring them to the Heaven-sent provisions that were to\r\nkeep them until spring than it would have been to transport the heavy\r\nbarrels of flour and pork to the mission.  At the same time, they could\r\nprotect the schooner from depredations by other wandering natives.\r\n\r\nSo they came, bag and baggage, babies, dogs, and all, and at once set\r\nto work constructing snug habitations, in which, with plenty of food\r\nand plenty of seal oil, they could live happily and comfortably during\r\nthe long winter months.  These structures were neither large nor\r\nelegant.  In fact they were only hovels sunk half underground, with low\r\nstone walls, supporting roofs of whale ribs, covered thick with earth.\r\nA little later they would be buried beneath warm, shapeless mounds of\r\nsnow.  To most of them outside light and air could only be admitted\r\nthrough the low doorways, but one, more pretentious than the others,\r\nwas provided with an old window sash, in which the place of missing\r\npanes was filled by dried intestines tightly stretched.  In every hovel\r\na stone lamp filled with seal oil burned night and day, furnishing\r\nlight, warmth, and the heat for melting ice into drinking water,\r\nboiling tea, drying wet mittens, and doing the family cooking.\r\n\r\nCabot and White were immensely interested in watching the construction\r\nof these primitive Labrador homes.  They were also amazed at the\r\nreadiness with which the natives made themselves snugly safe and\r\ncomfortable, in a place where they had despaired of keeping alive.\r\nBesides watching the Eskimo prepare for the winter and picking up many\r\nwords of their language, Cabot took daily lessons in snowshoeing and\r\nthe management of dog teams, in both of which arts White was already an\r\nadept.\r\n\r\nAccording to contract, both lads had been provided with complete\r\noutfits for Arctic travel, including fur clothing, boots, and sleeping\r\nbags.  A sledge with a fine team of dogs had also been placed at their\r\ndisposal, and an intelligent young Eskimo, who could speak some\r\nEnglish, was ready to guide them on their southward journey.  He was\r\nintroduced to his future travelling companions as Ildlat-Netschillik,\r\nwhereupon Cabot remarked:\r\n\r\n\"That is an elegant name for special occasions, such as might occur\r\nonce or twice in a lifetime, but seems to me something less ornamental,\r\nlike 'Jim,' for instance, would be better for everyday use.  I wonder\r\nif he would mind being called Jim?\"\r\n\r\nOn being asked this question the young Eskimo, grinning broadly, said:\r\n\r\n\"A' yite.  Yim plenty goot,\" and afterwards he always answered promptly\r\nand cheerfully to the name of \"Yim.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"Yim.\"]\r\n\r\nAt length snow fell for several days almost without intermission.  Then\r\na fierce wind took it in hand, kneading it, packing it, and stuffing it\r\ninto every crack and cranny of the landscape until hollows were filled,\r\nridges were nicely rounded, and rocks had disappeared.  In the\r\nmeantime, strong white bridges had been thrown across lake and stream,\r\nand the great Labrador highway for winter travel was formally opened to\r\nthe public.\r\n\r\nNovember was well advanced, and our lads had been prisoners in Locked\r\nHarbour for more than two months when this way of escape was opened to\r\nthem.  It had been decided that they should take a single large sledge,\r\nhaving broad runners, and a double team of dogs--ten in all.  On this,\r\ntherefore, was finally lashed a great load of provisions, frozen walrus\r\nmeat for dog food, sleeping bags, the three all-important cooking\r\nutensils of the wilderness--kettle, fry-pan, and teapot--an axe, and\r\nCabot's bag of specimens.  With this outfit Yim was to conduct them\r\nover the first half of their 400-mile journey, or to Indian Harbour,\r\nwhere, through a letter from the missionary, they expected to procure a\r\nfresh team, renew their supply of provisions, and obtain another guide,\r\nwho should go with them to Battle Harbour.\r\n\r\nWhen the time for starting arrived, the entire population of the new\r\nsettlement turned out to see them off and help get their heavily laden\r\nsledge up the steep ascent from the beach.  At the crest of the bluffs\r\nthe men fired a parting salute from their smooth-bore guns, the women\r\nand children uttered shrill cries of farewell, and the missionary gave\r\nthem his final blessing, Yim cracked his eighteen-foot whiplash like a\r\npistol shot, shouted to his dogs, and the yelping team sprang forward.\r\nOur lads gave a fond backward glance at their loved schooner, so far\r\nbelow them that she looked like a toy boat, and then, with hearts too\r\nfull for words, they faced the vast white wilderness outspread like a\r\nfrozen sea before them.\r\n\r\nAll that day they pushed steadily forward almost without a pause,\r\nholding a westerly course to pass around a deep fiord that penetrated\r\nfar inland, and might not yet be crossed with safety.  Yim ran beside\r\nhis straining dogs, encouraging the laggards with whip and voice; White\r\nled the way and broke the trail, while Cabot brought up the rear and\r\nhelped the sledge over difficult places.\r\n\r\nFor several hours they followed the signal line with its fluttering\r\nflags, and felt that they were still on familiar ground.  At length\r\neven these were left behind, and for three hours longer they plodded\r\nsturdily forward, guided only by Yim's unerring instinct.  Then the\r\nshort day came to an end and night descended with a chill breath of\r\nbitter winds.  Cabot was nearly exhausted, and even White was painfully\r\nweary, but both had been buoyed up by a hope that they might reach\r\ntimber and have abundant firewood for their first camp.  Now, when Yim,\r\nthrowing down his whip and giving his dogs the command to halt, calmly\r\nannounced that they would make camp where they were, both lads looked\r\nat him in dismay.\r\n\r\n\"We surely can't camp here in the snow without a fire or any kind of\r\nshelter!\" exclaimed Cabot.  \"Why, man, we'll be frozen stiff long\r\nbefore morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"A' yite.  Me fix um.  You see,\" responded Yim, cheerfully.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nTHE COMFORT OF AN ESKIMO LAMP.\r\n\r\nIn that dreary waste of snow, unrelieved so far as the eye could reach\r\nby so much as a single bush, the making of a camp that should contain\r\neven the rudiments of comfort seemed as hopeless to White, who had\r\nalways been accustomed to a timbered country, as it did to Cabot, who\r\nknew nothing of real camp life, and had only played at camping in the\r\nAdirondacks.  Left to their own devices, they would have passed a most\r\nuncomfortable if not a perilous night, for the mercury stood at many\r\ndegrees below zero.  But they had Yim with them, and he, being\r\nperfectly at home amid all that desolation, was determined to enjoy all\r\nthe home comforts it could be made to yield.\r\n\r\nFirst he marked out a circular space some twelve feet in diameter, from\r\nwhich he bade his companions excavate the snow with their snowshoes,\r\nand throw it out on the windward side.  While they were doing this he\r\nwent a short distance away, and, from a mass of closely compacted snow,\r\ncarved out with his knife a number of blocks, as large as could be\r\nhandled without breaking, to each of which he gave a slight curve.\r\nWith time enough Yim could have constructed from such slabs a perfect\r\nigloo or snow hut, but the fading daylight was very precious, and he\r\ndid not consider that the cold was yet sufficiently severe to demand a\r\ncomplete enclosure.  So he merely built a low, hood-like structure on\r\nthe windward side of the space the others had cleared.  One side of\r\nthis was still further extended by the sledge, relieved of its load and\r\nset on edge.\r\n\r\nThe precious provisions were placed inside the rude shelter, the\r\nsleeping bags covered its floor, and, when all was completed, Yim\r\nsurveyed his work with great satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\"It is pretty good so far as it goes,\" admitted.  White, dubiously,\r\n\"but I don't see how we are to get along without at least enough fire\r\nto boil a pot of tea, and of course we can't have a fire without wood.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's so,\" agreed Cabot, shivering.\r\n\r\nYim only smiled knowingly as he groped among the miscellaneous articles\r\npiled at the back of the hut.  From them he finally drew forth a\r\nshallow soapstone bowl having one straight side about six inches long.\r\nIt was shaped something like a clam shell, and was a specimen of the\r\nworld-famed Eskimo cooking lamp.  He also produced a bladder full of\r\nseal oil.\r\n\r\n\"Good enough!\" cried Cabot.  \"Yim has remembered to bring along his\r\ntravelling cook stove.\"\r\n\r\nSetting the lamp in the most sheltered corner of the hut, Yim filled it\r\nwith oil, and then, drawing forth a pouch that hung from his neck, he\r\nproduced a wick made of sphagnum moss previously dried, rolled, and\r\noiled.  This he laid carefully along the straight side of the lamp.\r\nThen, turning to Cabot, he uttered the single word: \"Metches.\"\r\n\r\n\"Great Scott!\" exclaimed the young engineer, \"I forgot to bring any.\r\nBut of course you must have some, White.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I haven't.  Matches were among the things you were to look after,\r\nand so I never gave them a thought.\"\r\n\r\nThe spirits of the lads, raised to a high pitch of expectation by the\r\nsight of Yim's lamp, suddenly sank to zero with the discovery that they\r\nhad no means for lighting it.  Yim, however, only smiled at their\r\ndismay.  Of course he had long since learned the use of matches, and to\r\nappreciate them at their full value; but he also knew how to produce\r\nfire without their aid in the simplest manner ever devised by primitive\r\nman.  It is the friction method of rubbing wood against wood, and, in\r\none form or another, is used all over the world.  It was known to the\r\nmost ancient Egyptians, and is practised to-day by natives of the\r\nAmazon valley, dwellers on South Pacific islands, inhabitants of Polar\r\nregions, Indians of North America, and the negroes of Central Africa.\r\nThese widely scattered peoples use various models of wooden drills,\r\nploughs, or saws.  But Yim's method is the simplest of all.  When he\r\nsaw that no matches were forthcoming, he said:\r\n\r\n\"A' yite.  Me fix um.\"  At the same time he produced two pieces of soft\r\nwood from some hiding place in his garments.  One of these, known as\r\nthe \"spindle,\" was a stick about two feet long by three-quarters of an\r\ninch in diameter and having a rounded point.  The other, called the\r\n\"hearth,\" was flat, about eighteen inches in length, half an inch\r\nthick, and three inches wide.  On its upper surface, close to one edge,\r\nwere several slight cavities, each just large enough to hold the\r\nrounded end of the spindle, and from each was cut a narrow slot down\r\nthe side of the hearth.  This slot is an indispensable feature, and\r\nwithout it all efforts to produce fire by wood-friction must fail.\r\n\r\nLaying the hearth on the flat side of a sledge runner and kneeling on\r\nit to hold it firmly in position, Yim set the rounded end of his\r\nspindle in one of its depressions, and holding the upper end between\r\nthe palms of his hands, began to twirl it rapidly, at the same time\r\nexerting all possible downward pressure.  As his hands moved towards\r\nthe lower end of the spindle he dexterously shifted them back to the\r\ntop, without lifting it or allowing air to get under its lower end.\r\n\r\nWith the continuation of the twirling process a tiny stream of wood\r\nmeal, ground off by friction, poured through the slot at the side of\r\nthe hearth, and accumulated in a little pile, that all at once began to\r\nsmoke.  In two seconds more it was a glowing coal of fire.  Then Yim\r\ndropped his spindle, covered the coal with a bit of tinder previously\r\nmade ready, and blew it into a flame, which he deftly transferred to\r\nthe wick of his lamp.\r\n\r\nAt sight of the first spiral of smoke our lads had been filled with\r\namazement.  As the coal began to glow they uttered exclamations of\r\ndelight, and when the actual flame appeared they broke into such\r\nenthusiastic cheering as set all the dogs to barking in sympathy.\r\n\r\n\"It is one of the most wonderful things I ever saw,\" cried Cabot.\r\n\"I've often read of fire being produced by wood friction, and I have\r\ntried it lots of times myself, but as I never could raise even a smoke,\r\nand never before met any one who could, I decided that it was all a\r\nfake got up by story writers.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was rather doubtful about it myself,\" admitted White.  \"But, I say!\r\nIsn't that a great lamp, and doesn't it make things look cheery?\"\r\n\r\nWhite's approval of \"Yim's cook stove,\" as Cabot called it, was well\r\nmerited, for its five inches of blazing wick yielded as much light and\r\ntwice the heat of a first-class kerosene lamp.  Over it Yim had already\r\nsuspended a kettle full of snow, and now he laid a slab of frozen pork\r\nclose beside it to be thawed out.\r\n\r\nWhile waiting for these he fed the dogs, who had been watching him with\r\nwistful eyes and impatient yelpings.  To each he threw a two-pound\r\nchunk of frozen walrus meat, and each devoured his portion with such\r\nravenous rapidity that Cabot declared they swallowed them whole.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour after the lamp was lighted it had converted enough snow\r\ninto boiling water to provide three steaming cups of tea, and while our\r\nlads sipped at these Yim cut slices of thawed pork, laid them in the\r\nfry-pan, and holding this over his lamp soon had them sizzling and\r\nbrowning in the most appetising manner.  This, with tea and ship\r\nbiscuit, constituted their supper.\r\n\r\nWhen Yim no longer needed his lamp for cooking he removed two-thirds of\r\nits wick and allowed the flame thus reduced to burn all night.  Over it\r\nhung a kettle of melting snow, and above this, on a snowshoe, supported\r\nby two others, wet mittens and moccasins were slowly but thoroughly\r\ndried.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the hot tea, their fur-lined sleeping bags, and the\r\neffective wind-break behind which they were huddled, our lads suffered\r\nwith cold long before the night was over, and were quite willing to\r\nmake a start when Yim, after a glance at the stars, announced that\r\ndaylight was only three hours away.  For breakfast they had more\r\nscalding tea and a quantity of hard bread, broken into small bits,\r\nsoaked in warm water, fried in seal oil, and eaten with sugar.  White\r\npronounced this fine, but Cabot only ate it under protest, because, as\r\nhe said, he must fill up with something.\r\n\r\nThe travel of that day, with its accompaniments of blisters and\r\nstrained muscles, was much harder than that of the day before, and our\r\nweary lads were thankful when, towards its close, they entered a belt\r\nof timber that had been in sight for hours.\r\n\r\nThat night they slept warmly and soundly on luxurious beds of spruce\r\nboughs beside a great fire frequently replenished by Yim.\r\n\r\n\"I tell you what,\" said Cabot, as, early in the evening, he basked in\r\nthe heat of this blaze, \"there's nothing in all this world so good as\r\nthat.  For my part I consider fire to be the greatest blessing ever\r\nconferred upon mankind.\"\r\n\r\n\"How about light, air, water, food, and sleep?\" asked White.\r\n\r\n\"Those are necessaries, but fire is a luxury.  Not only that, but it is\r\nthe first of all luxuries and the one upon which nearly all others\r\ndepend.\"\r\n\r\nWhen, a little later, Cabot lay so close to the blaze that his sleeping\r\nbag caught on fire, and he burned his hands in putting it out, White\r\nlaughingly asked:\r\n\r\n\"What do you think of your luxury now?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think,\" was the reply, \"that it proves itself the greatest of\r\nluxuries by punishing over-indulgence in it with the greatest amount of\r\npain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Umph!\" remarked Yim, who was listening, \"Big fire, goot.  Baby fire,\r\nmore goot.  Innuit yamp mos' goot of any.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, pshaw!\" retorted Cabot, \"your sooty little lamp isn't in it with a\r\nblaze like that.\"\r\n\r\nOn the third day of their journey the party had skirted the edge of the\r\ntimber for several hours, when all at once Yim held his head high with\r\ndilated nostrils.  At the same time it was noticed that the dogs were\r\nalso sniffing eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"What is it, Yim?\"\r\n\r\n\"Fire.  Injin fire,\" was the reply.\r\n\r\n\"I'd like to know how you can tell an Indian fire from any other,\" said\r\nCabot.  \"Especially when it is so far away that I can't smell anything\r\nbut cold air.\"\r\n\r\nBut Yim was right, for, after a while, his companions also smelled\r\nsmoke, and a little later the yelping of their dogs was answered by\r\nshrill cries from within the timber.  Suddenly two tattered scarecrows\r\nof children emerged from the thick growth, stared for an instant, and\r\nthen, with terrified expressions, darted back like frightened rabbits.\r\n\r\n\"The Arsenic kids!\" cried Cabot, who had recognised them.  \"Now I'll\r\ncatch that scoundrel.\"  As he spoke he sprang after the children, and\r\nwas instantly lost to view in the low timber.\r\n\r\n\"Hold on!\" shouted White.  \"You'll run into an ambush.\"\r\n\r\nBut Cabot, crashing through the undergrowth, failed to hear the\r\nwarning, and with the loyalty of true friendship White started after\r\nhim.  A minute later he overtook his impulsive comrade standing still\r\nand gazing irresolute at a canvas tent, black with age and smoke, and\r\npatched in many places.  It stood on the edge of a small lake, and\r\nshowed no sign of occupancy save a slender curl of smoke that drifted\r\nfrom a vent hole in its apex.\r\n\r\n\"Get behind cover,\" cried White.  \"They may take a pot shot at any\r\nmoment.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe it,\" replied Cabot.  \"Any way, I'm bound to see what's\r\ninside.\"\r\n\r\nThus saying he stepped forward and lifted the dingy flap.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nOBJECTS OF CHARITY.\r\n\r\nWhile Cabot felt very bitter against the young Indian whom he had named\r\n\"Arsenic,\" on account of the base ingratitude with which the latter had\r\nrepaid the kindness shown him, and was determined to punish him for it\r\nin some way, he had not the slightest idea what form the punishment\r\nwould take.  Of course he did not intend to kill Arsenic, nor even to\r\nseverely injure him, but he had thought of giving the rascal a sound\r\nthrashing, and only hoped he could make him understand what it was for.\r\nIn the excitement of the past two weeks he had forgotten all about\r\nArsenic, but the sight of those ragged children had awakened his\r\nanimosity, and he had followed them, hoping that they would lead him to\r\nthe object of his just wrath.  It was only when he reached the\r\nsorry-looking tent that he remembered the other savages whom Arsenic\r\nhad brought with him on his second visit to the schooner, and wondered\r\nif some of them might not be concealed behind the canvas screen ready\r\nto spring upon him.\r\n\r\nWith this thought he stepped nimbly to one side as he threw open the\r\nflap, and stood for a moment waiting for what might happen.  There was\r\nno rush of men and no sound, save only a faint cry of terror, hearing\r\nwhich Cabot peered cautiously around the edge of the opening.\r\n\r\nA poor little fire of sticks smouldered on the ground in the middle,\r\nfilling the place with a pungent smoke.  Through this Cabot could at\r\nfirst make out only a confused huddle at one side, from which several\r\npairs of eyes glared at him like those of wild beasts.  As he entered\r\nthe tent a human figure detached itself from this and strove to rise,\r\nbut fell back weakly helpless.  In another moment a closer view\r\ndisclosed to Cabot the whole dreadful situation.  The huddle resolved\r\nitself into a woman, hollow-cheeked and gaunt with sickness and hunger,\r\ntwo children in slightly better plight, and a little dead baby.  There\r\nwas no other person in the tent, and it contained no furnishing except\r\nthe heap of boughs, rags, and scraps of fur that passed for a bed, and\r\na broken kettle that lay beside the fire.  On the floor were scattered\r\na few bones picked clean, from which even the marrow had been\r\nextracted; but otherwise there was no vestige of food.\r\n\r\n\"I believe they are starving to death!\" cried Cabot, as he made these\r\ndiscoveries.\r\n\r\n\"It certainly looks like it,\" replied White, who had followed his\r\nfriend into the tent.  \"I wonder what they did with all the provisions\r\nthey stole from us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Probably they were taken from them in turn to feed those other\r\nIndians.  At any rate, they are destitute enough now, and we can't\r\nleave them here to die.  Go and bring Yim with the sled as quick as you\r\ncan, while I wake up this fire.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" replied White, \"only I'm afraid he won't come.\"\r\n\r\n\"He must come,\" said Cabot decisively.\r\n\r\nThe hatred between Eskimo and Indian is so bitter that it took all\r\nWhite's powers of persuasion, together with certain threats, to bring\r\nYim to the tent, but once there even he was sufficiently roused by its\r\nspectacle of suffering to bestir himself most actively.\r\n\r\nDuring the next hour, while the starving, half-frozen Indians were\r\nwarmed and fed, the rescuers discussed the situation and what should be\r\ndone.  They could not leave the helpless family as they had found them,\r\nneither could they carry them away, and it would be folly to remain\r\nwith them longer than was absolutely necessary.  They could not gain a\r\nword of information from the woman or children as to how they had\r\narrived at such a pitiable plight, what they had done with the stolen\r\nprovisions, why their friends had abandoned them, or what had become of\r\nArsenic.\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell you what,\" said Cabot at length; \"we'll provide them with a\r\nsupply of wood and leave all the provisions we can possibly spare.\r\nThen we will hurry on to Indian Harbour, send back some more provisions\r\nfrom there by Yim, and get him to report the case to Mr. Mellins.\"\r\n\r\nAs there seemed nothing better to be done, this plan was carried out,\r\nthough dividing the provisions made each portion look woefully small,\r\nand by noon the sledge was again on its way southward.\r\n\r\nThe head of the fiord having been reached, the trail now left the\r\nsheltering timber and struck across an open country, which was also\r\nextremely rugged, abounding in hills and hollows.  Over these the\r\nsledge pulled heavily, in spite of its lightened load, because one of\r\nthe ice shoes, with which its runners were shod, had broken and could\r\nnot be repaired until camp was made.\r\n\r\nWhen they had gone about three miles, and while our lads were still\r\ntalking of the suffering they had so recently witnessed, they were\r\nattracted by an exclamation from Yim, who was pointing eagerly ahead.\r\nLooking in that direction, they saw a line of dark objects, that had\r\njust topped a distant ridge, running swiftly towards them.\r\n\r\n\"Caribou!\" shouted White, in great excitement, at the same time seizing\r\nhis rifle from the sledge and hastily removing it from its sealskin\r\ncase.  In another minute sledge and dogs were concealed in a bit of a\r\ngully, with Cabot to watch them, while Yim and White, lying flat behind\r\nthe crest of a low ridge, were eagerly noting the course of the\r\napproaching animals.  When it became evident that they would pass at\r\nsome distance on the right, White, crouching low, ran in that direction.\r\n\r\nThe caribou appeared badly frightened, pausing every few moments to\r\nface about and cast terrified glances over the way they had come.  All\r\nat once, during one of these pauses, a shot rang out, followed quickly\r\nby another, and, as the terrified animals dashed madly away in a new\r\ndirection, one of their number dropped behind, staggered, and fell.\r\n\r\n\"I've got him!  I've got him!\" yelled White, wild with the joy of his\r\nachievement.\r\n\r\n\"Hurrah for us!\" shouted Cabot.  \"Steaks and spare-ribs for supper\r\nto-night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yip, yip, yip!\" screamed Yim to his dogs, and with a jubilant chorus\r\nof yells and yelpings, the entire outfit streamed over the ridge to the\r\nplace where the unfortunate caribou lay motionless.\r\n\r\nIn his broken English Yim gave the lads to understand that it would be\r\nadvisable to camp where they were, in order to prepare their meat for\r\ntransportation, and also to mend their broken sledge shoe.  This\r\nlatter, he explained, could be done much better with a mixture of blood\r\nand snow than with any other available material.  He furthermore\r\nintimated that he feared they might be overtaken by a blizzard before\r\nmorning, in which case they could best defy it in a regularly built\r\nigloo.\r\n\r\nAll these reasons for delay seemed so good that the others accepted\r\nthem, and the work outlined by Yim was immediately begun.  In cutting\r\nup the caribou, as in building the snow hut, Cabot, from lack of\r\nexperience, could give but slight assistance, and, realising this, he\r\nmade a proposal.\r\n\r\n\"Look here,\" he said.  \"The wood we have brought along won't last long\r\nand I want a good fire to-night.  I also want to carry some of this\r\nmeat to those poor wretches we have just left.  We have got more than\r\nwe can take with us, anyhow.  So I am going back with a leg of venison,\r\nand on my return I'll bring all the wood I can pack.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you might lose the way,\" objected White.\r\n\r\n\"No one could lose so plain a trail as the one we have just made,\"\r\nreplied Cabot, scornfully.\r\n\r\n\"Suppose it should be dark before you got back?\"\r\n\r\n\"There will be three hours of daylight yet, and I won't be gone more\r\nthan two at the most.  Anyhow, I must get some of this meat to those\r\nstarving children.\"\r\n\r\nWhite's protests were ineffectual before Cabot's strong resolve, and,\r\nas soon as a forequarter of the caribou could be made ready, the latter\r\nget forth on his errand of mercy.  Although he had no difficulty in\r\nfinding the trail, it was so much harder to walk with a heavy load than\r\nit had been without one that a full hour had passed before he again\r\ncame within sight of the lonely tent in the forest.\r\n\r\nOne of the children who was outside spied him and announced his coming,\r\nso that when he entered the tent he again found a frightened group\r\nhuddled together and apprehensively awaiting him.  But they were\r\nstronger now, and the children uttered little squeals of joy at sight\r\nof the meat he had brought, while even the haggard face of their mother\r\nwas lighted by a fleeting smile.\r\n\r\nFor the pleasure of seeing the children eat Cabot toasted a few strips\r\nof venison over the coals, and these smelled so good that he cut off\r\nsome more for himself.  In this occupation he spent another hour\r\nwithout realising the flight of time, and had eaten a quantity of meat\r\nthat he would have deemed impossible had it all been placed before him\r\nat once.\r\n\r\nAs he was bending over the fire toasting a strip that he said to\r\nhimself should be the last, a slight cry from one of the children\r\ncaused him to look up.  He barely caught a glimpse of a face at the\r\nentrance as it was hastily withdrawn, but in that moment he recognised\r\nthe features of Arsenic.  At sight of the ill-favoured young Indian all\r\nof Cabot's former resentment flamed up, and springing to his feet he\r\ndashed from the tent, determined to give Arsenic the thrashing he\r\ndeserved.\r\n\r\nOf course Cabot had removed his snowshoes, but, as the young Indian had\r\ndone the same thing, both were compelled to readjust these\r\nall-important articles, without which they would have floundered\r\nhelplessly in the deep snow.\r\n\r\nArsenic was off first, and though Cabot chased him hotly he could not\r\novercome the advantage thus gained.  Being also much less expert in the\r\nmanagement of snowshoes, he tripped several times, and finally pitched\r\nheadlong.  When he next regained his feet Arsenic had disappeared in\r\nthe timber, and our lad realised the futility of a further pursuit.\r\nNow, too, he noticed that the sky had become heavily overcast, and that\r\na strong wind was soughing ominously through the tree tops.\r\n\r\n\"It must be later than I thought,\" he reflected, \"and high time for me\r\nto be getting back to camp.\"  With this he hastily gathered a bundle of\r\nsticks to be used as firewood and started, as he supposed, towards the\r\nopen; but so confused was he, and so many turns did he make, that more\r\nthan half an hour was wasted before he finally emerged from the timber.\r\nHere he was dismayed to find that snow was falling, or rather being\r\ndriven in straight lines by the wind, which had increased to the force\r\nof a gale.\r\n\r\n\"I've got to hump myself to reach camp before dark, but I'll make it\r\nall right,\" he remarked to himself, as he set forth across the white\r\nplain.\r\n\r\nHe took a diagonal course that he hoped would lead him to the trail,\r\nbut by the time all landmarks were obliterated by the descending night\r\nhe had failed to find it.  In looking back he could not even\r\ndistinguish the timber line from which he had come.  Then the awful\r\nconviction slowly forced itself upon him that he was lost in a\r\ntrackless wilderness, swept by the first fury of an Arctic blizzard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nLOST IN A BLIZZARD.\r\n\r\nSo numbed was our poor lad by the shock of his discovery that, for a\r\nfew moments, he stood motionless.  Of course it would be of no use to\r\ncontinue his hopeless struggle.  Even if he had come in the right\r\ndirection he must ere this have passed the place where his companions\r\nwere encamped.  If he could only regain the timber there might be a\r\nslight chance of surviving the night; but even its location was lost to\r\nhim, and a certain death stared him in the face.  At any rate it would\r\nbe a painless ending, for he had only to lie down to be quickly covered\r\nby a soft blanket of snow.  Then he could go to sleep never again to\r\nwaken.  He was very weary, and already so drowsy that the thought of\r\nsleep was pleasant to him.  Such a death would certainly not be so\r\nterrible as drowning after a hopeless struggle with black waters.\r\n\r\nWith this thought every incident of that awful night after the loss of\r\nthe \"Lavinia\" flashed into his mind.  How utterly hopeless had seemed\r\nhis situation then and how desperately he had fought for his life.  But\r\nhe had fought, and had won the fight.  What was the use of learning a\r\nlesson of that kind if he could not profit by it?  Was not his life as\r\nwell worth fighting for now as then?  Of course it was; nor was his\r\npresent position any more hopeless than that one had been.  Then he had\r\ndrifted with the wind, and now he would do the same thing.  If he could\r\nhold out long enough he would fetch up somewhere sometime.  It was\r\nmerely a question of endurance.  Even in that howling wilderness, with\r\ndeath on all sides, there were still three chances for life.  The drift\r\nwith the wind might take him to the igloo that Yim must have built ere\r\nthis.  How bright, and warm, and cosey its lamplighted interior would\r\nbe.  How glad they would be to see him, and how he would laugh at all\r\nhis recent fears.  But of course there was not one chance in a million\r\nof his finding the igloo.  It was not at all unlikely, though, that the\r\ndrift might take him to a belt of timber, into which the bitter wind\r\ncould not penetrate; and where he could crawl under the thick,\r\nlow-hanging branches of some tent-like spruce.  Even such a shelter now\r\nseemed very desirable, and would be accepted with thankfulness.  If he\r\nfailed to reach timber, the wind might blow him to some region of\r\ncliffs and rocks that would shelter him from its cutting blasts.  If he\r\nmissed all these chances, and if worse came to worst, he could always\r\ngo to sleep beneath the snow blanket, and it would be better to do that\r\nwith the consciousness of having made a good fight than to yield now\r\nlike a coward.\r\n\r\nAll these thoughts flashed through Cabot's mind within the space of a\r\nminute, and, having determined to fight until the battle was either won\r\nor lost, he flung away his now useless burden of firewood and started\r\noff down the wind.  Tramping through that newly fallen snow, even with\r\nthe support of racquets, was exhausting work, but the effort at least\r\nkept him warm, and, before he came to the end of his strength, some\r\nhours later, he had covered a number of miles.  He had also come to the\r\nleast promising of the three places he had hoped for, and found himself\r\nin a region of cliffs, precipices, and huge rocks, among which he could\r\nno longer make headway, even though he had not reached the limit of\r\nendurance.\r\n\r\nBut he had reached that limit, and now only sought a spot in which he\r\nmight lie down and go to sleep.  Of course the snow would quickly cover\r\nhim, and doubtless he would be buried deep ere the fury of the storm\r\nwas past.  But he had a vague plan for putting his snowshoes over his\r\nhead like an inverted V, and hoped in that way to be kept from\r\nsmothering.  At the same time he had little thought that he should ever\r\nsee the light of another day.\r\n\r\n\"Only a bit further and then I can rest,\" he muttered, as he pushed\r\ninto the blackness of a rift between two tall cliffs, and experienced a\r\npartial relief from the furious wind.  It seemed as though he ought to\r\npenetrate this as far as possible, and so he struggled weakly forward.\r\nThen he stumbled over something that lay across his path and fell\r\nheavily.  As he lay wondering whether an attempt to regain his feet\r\nwould be worth while, he seemed to hear the distant but strenuous\r\nringing of an electric bell, and almost smiled at the absurdity of such\r\na fancy in such a place.  The thought carried him back to the\r\nelectrical laboratory of the Institute, and he began to dream that he\r\nwas still a student of ohms, volts, and amperes.\r\n\r\nIn another moment his consciousness would have been wholly merged in\r\ndreams, but suddenly the place where he lay was filled with a blaze of\r\nlight that apparently streamed from the solid rock on either side.  So\r\nintense was this light that it penetrated even Cabot's closed eyes, and\r\naroused him from the stupor into which he had fallen.  He lifted his\r\nhead, and, still bewildered, wondered why the laboratory was so\r\nbrilliantly illuminated.\r\n\r\nThen, through the glare, he saw the driving snow-flakes with their\r\ndancing shadows magnified a hundred fold, and, all at once, he\r\nremembered.  Staggering to his feet, and groping with outstretched\r\narms, he pushed forward along the narrow pathway outlined by the\r\nmysterious light.  He no longer heard the sound of bells, but in its\r\nplace came strains of music that blended weirdly with the shrieking\r\nwind, and irresistibly compelled him forward.  The pathway sloped\r\ndownward and then took a sharp turn.  As Cabot passed this the light\r\nbehind him was extinguished as suddenly as it had appeared, the wild\r\nmusic sounded louder than ever, and directly in front of him gleamed\r\ntwo squares of light like windows.  Between them was a dark space,\r\ntowards which he instinctively stumbled.  It proved to be as he had\r\nhoped, a door massive and without any means of unclosing that his blind\r\nfumblings could discover.  So he beat against it feebly and uttered a\r\nhoarse cry for help.  In another moment it was opened, and Cabot,\r\nleaning heavily against it, fell into a room, small, warm, and brightly\r\nlighted.\r\n\r\nFor a few minutes he lay with closed eyes, barely conscious that his\r\nstruggle for life had been successful, and that in some mysterious\r\nmanner he had gained a place of safety.  Gradually he became aware that\r\nsome one was bending over him, and opening his eyes he gazed full into\r\na face that he instantly recognised, though it had sadly changed since\r\nhe last saw it.  At that time it had expressed strength in every line,\r\nbut now it was haggard and worn by suffering.\r\n\r\n\"The Man-wolf!\" gasped Cabot, in a voice hardly above a whisper.\r\n\r\nA slight smile flitted across the man's face, and then, without\r\nwarning, he sank to the floor in a dead faint.  His mighty strength had\r\nbeen turned to the weakness of water, and the iron will had at length\r\nrelaxed its hold upon the enfeebled body.  As the man-wolf fell, a\r\nstream of blood trickled from his mouth, and he choked for breath as\r\nthough strangling.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing so effective in restoring spent strength as a demand\r\nupon it from one who is weaker, and at sight of the big man's\r\nhelplessness Cabot was instantly nerved to renewed effort.  He sat up,\r\ncut loose his snowshoes, closed the open door, and rid himself of his\r\nsnow-laden outer garments.  Then, by a supreme effort, he managed to\r\ndrag the unconscious man to a bed that was piled with robes and lean\r\nhim against it.  His eyes had already lighted on a jug of water, and\r\nfetching this he bathed the sufferer's face, washed the blood from his\r\nmouth, and finally had the satisfaction of seeing his eyes unclose.\r\nThen he helped him on to the bed, and though during the operation the\r\nman's face expressed the most intense pain, he uttered no sound.  But\r\nthe movement was accompanied by another hemorrhage, so severe that it\r\nseemed to our distressed lad as though the man must surely bleed to\r\ndeath before it was checked.  When it finally ceased the exhausted\r\nsufferer dropped asleep, and, for the first time since entering that\r\nplace of mysteries, Cabot found an opportunity for looking about him.\r\n\r\nAlthough the room was small it was comfortably furnished with a table,\r\nchairs--one of which was a rocker--a lounge, and the bed on which the\r\nman-wolf lay.  There were no windows nor doors except those in front.\r\nThe ceiling was of heavy canvas tightly stretched, while the walls were\r\nhung with the skins of fur-bearing animals, and the floor was covered\r\nwith rugs of the same material.  At first Cabot paid no attention to\r\nthese details, for his eyes were fixed upon the most astonishing thing\r\nhe had seen in all Labrador.  It was a lamp that, depending from the\r\nceiling, gave to the room an illumination as brilliant as daylight.\r\n\r\n\"Electric, as I live!\" gasped the young engineer.  \"A regular\r\nincandescent, and those lights out on the trail must have been the\r\nsame.  That was an electric bell too.  I know it now, though I couldn't\r\nbelieve my ears at the time.  The light he scared the Indians with must\r\nhave been an electric flash, worked by a storage battery.  But it is\r\nall so incredible!  I wonder if I am really awake or still dreaming?\"\r\n\r\nTo assure himself on this point Cabot went to the light, and, as he did\r\nso, came upon another surprise greater than any that had preceded it.\r\nHe had wondered at the comfortable temperature of the room, for there\r\nwas nowhere a fire to be seen, and the blizzard still howled outside\r\nwith unabated fury.  Now, on drawing near to the lamp, he found himself\r\nalso approaching some heretofore unobserved source of heat, which he\r\ndiscovered to be a drum of sheet iron.  It stood by itself, unconnected\r\nwith any chimney, and apparently had no receptacle for any form of\r\nfuel, solid, liquid, or gaseous.\r\n\r\n\"A Balfour electric heater,\" murmured Cabot, in an awe-stricken tone,\r\n\"and I didn't even know they had been perfected.  I don't suppose there\r\nare half-a-dozen in use in all the world, and yet here is one of them\r\ndoing its full duty up here in the Labrador wilderness, a thousand\r\nmiles from anywhere.  It is fully equal to any tale of the Arabian\r\nNights, and Mr. Homolupus must, as the natives say, be either a god or\r\na devil.  I do wonder who he is, where he came from, what has happened\r\nto him, where he gets his electricity, and a thousand other things.  I\r\nwish he would wake up, and I wish he could talk.\"\r\n\r\nCabot's curiosity concerning the weird music that had drawn him to that\r\nplace had been partially satisfied by the discovery of a violin on the\r\nfloor beside the sick man's bed.  Now, as he flung himself wearily down\r\non the lounge for a bit of rest, he became conscious of the muffled\r\nb-r-r-r of a dynamo.  That accounted in a measure for the electric\r\nlights, but still left our lad in a daze of wonder at the nature of his\r\nsurroundings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nAN ELECTRICIAN IN THE WILDERNESS.\r\n\r\nWhen Cabot threw himself down on that lounge he fully intended to\r\nremain awake, or at most to take only a series of short naps, always\r\nholding himself in readiness to assist the sufferer on the opposite\r\nside of the room.  But exhausted nature proved too much for his good\r\nintentions, and he had hardly lain down before he fell into a dead,\r\ndreamless sleep that lasted for many hours.  When he next awoke it was\r\nwith a start, and he sat up bewildered by the strangeness of his\r\nenvironment.  Daylight was streaming in at the frost-covered windows\r\nand the storm of the night before had evidently spent its fury.\r\n\r\nAlmost the first thing he saw was the tall form of his host bending\r\nfeebly over the electric stove.  His face was drawn with pain, and he\r\nwas so weak that he was compelled to support himself by grasping the\r\ntable with one hand while with the other he stirred the contents of a\r\nsimmering kettle.\r\n\r\n\"Let me do that, sir!\" cried Cabot, springing to his feet.  \"You are\r\nnot fit to be out of your bed, and I am perfectly familiar with the\r\nmanagement of electrical cooking apparatus, though I don't know much\r\nabout cooking itself.\"\r\n\r\nThe man hesitated a moment, and then permitted the other to lead him\r\nback to his bed, on which he sank with a groan.  Here Cabot made him as\r\ncomfortable as possible before turning his attention to the stove.  On\r\nit he found two kettles, each having its own wire connections, in one\r\nof which was boiling water while the other contained a meat stew.  On\r\nthe table was a box of tea, a bowl of sugar, and a plate heaped with\r\nhard bread.  Finding other dishes in a cupboard, Cabot made a pot of\r\ntea, turned off the electric current, and served breakfast.  Before\r\neating a mouthful himself he prepared a bowl of broth for his patient,\r\nwhich the latter managed to swallow after many attempts and painful\r\neffort.\r\n\r\nCabot ate ravenously, and, after his meal, felt once more ready to face\r\nany number of difficulties.  First he went to the bedside of his host\r\nand said:\r\n\r\n\"Now, Mr. Homolupus, I want to find out what is the trouble and what I\r\ncan do for you.  Are you wounded, or just naturally ill?\"\r\n\r\nThe man looked at his questioner for a moment, as though he were on the\r\npoint of speaking.  Then he seemed to change his mind, and, reaching\r\nfor a pencil and pad that lay close at hand, he wrote:\r\n\r\n\"I am shot in the chest.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who--I mean how----\" began Cabot, and then, realising that his\r\ncuriosity could well wait, he added: \"But, with your permission, I will\r\nexamine the wound and see if there is anything I can do.\"\r\n\r\nWith this he sought and gently removed a blood-soaked bandage, thereby\r\ndisclosing a sight so ghastly that it almost unnerved him.  The wound\r\nwas so terrible, and the loss of blood from it had evidently been so\r\ngreat, that how even the giant frame of the man-wolf could have\r\nsurvived it was amazing.  Having no knowledge of surgery, Cabot could\r\nonly bathe and rebandage it.  Then he said:\r\n\r\n\"Now, I am going to be your nurse, and you must lie perfectly still\r\nwithout attempting to get up again until I give you leave.\"\r\n\r\nSeeing an expression of dissent in the man's face, he continued:\r\n\r\n\"It's all right.  I am under the greatest of obligations to you, and am\r\nonly too glad of a chance to pay some of it back.  So I shall stay\r\nright here just as long as you need me.  Fortunately I know something\r\nabout both electricity and machinery, having been educated at a\r\ntechnical institute, so that I shall be able to manage very well with\r\nyour plant.  But I do wish you could explain a few things to me.  Is\r\nyour name really 'Homolupus'?\"\r\n\r\nThe sufferer smiled and wrote on his pad:\r\n\r\n\"My name is Watson Balfour.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"My name is Watson Balfour.\"]\r\n\r\n\"Of London?\" queried Cabot.\r\n\r\nThe man nodded.\r\n\r\n\"Is it possible that you can be Watson Balfour, the celebrated English\r\nelectrician, who is supposed to have been lost at sea some years ago?\"\r\n\r\nAgain the man smiled and made a sign of assent.\r\n\r\nFor a moment Cabot stared, well nigh speechless with the wonder and\r\nexcitement of this discovery.  Then he broke into a torrent of\r\nexclamations and questions.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Mr. Balfour, I know you so well by reputation that you seem like\r\nan old friend.  Your 'Handbook of Electricity' and your 'Comparative\r\nVoltage' are text books at the Institute.  The whole scientific world\r\nmourned your supposed death.  But how do you happen to be up here, and\r\nhow have you managed to establish an electric plant in this wilderness?\r\nWhy are you masquerading as a man-wolf?  How did you lose the power of\r\nspeech?  How did you become so severely wounded?  Can't you tell me\r\nsome of these things?\"\r\n\r\nFor answer Mr. Balfour wrote: \"Perhaps, some time.  Tell first how you\r\ncame here.\"\r\n\r\nSo Cabot, forced to curb for the present his own overpowering\r\ncuriosity, sat down and told of all that had happened since the\r\ndeparture of the man-wolf from Locked Harbour.  When he had finished he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"And now, I ought to go outside and see if I can discover any trace of\r\nmy companions, who must be awfully cut up over my disappearance.  But\r\ndon't be uneasy, Mr. Balfour, I shan't go far, and whether I find them\r\nor not I shall certainly come back to stay just as long as you need me.\r\nI hope you will sleep while I am gone, and I wish you would promise not\r\nto leave your bed, or move more than is absolutely necessary, before my\r\nreturn.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Cabot first stepped outside the shelter that had proved such a\r\nhaven of safety to him, he was dazzled by the brilliancy of the day.\r\nAfter becoming somewhat accustomed to the glare of sunlight on\r\nnew-fallen snow, he turned to see what sort of a house he had just\r\nleft.  To his surprise there was no house; the only suggestion of one\r\nbeing two windows and a door set in a wall of rock that was built at\r\nthe base of a cliff.\r\n\r\n\"It is a cavern,\" thought Cabot, \"and that is the reason the room is so\r\neasily kept warm.  Mighty good thing to have in this country,\r\nespecially when it is lined with furs.\"\r\n\r\nThe snow lay unbroken, and there was no sign of the trail he had made\r\nthe night before.  For a short distance, however, he could go in but\r\none direction, for the only way out was through the narrow defile by\r\nwhich he had entered.  At its mouth he found the wire over which he had\r\nfallen, and thereby given notice of his approach by causing the ringing\r\nof an electric bell.\r\n\r\n\"When he heard it he turned on the lights,\" said Cabot to himself.\r\n\"It's a great scheme for scaring off Indians and attracting white men.\r\nI wonder if any other person ever found the place?  What a marvellous\r\nthing my stumbling on it was, anyhow.  Now, which way did I come?\"\r\n\r\nGazing blankly at the surrounding chaos of snow-covered rocks, our lad\r\ncould form no idea of the route by which he had been led to that place,\r\nthrough the storm and darkness of the preceding night, nor of how he\r\nmight leave it.\r\n\r\n\"There is no use wandering aimlessly,\" he decided at length, \"and I'll\r\neither have to gain a bird's-eye view of the country or get Mr. Balfour\r\nto make me a map.  To think that I should have discovered him, and here\r\nof all places in the world.  What a sensation it will make when I tell\r\nof it.  Of course I shall do so, for I'll get out of this fix all right\r\nsomehow.  What a state of mind poor White must be in this morning.  I\r\nknow I should be in his place.  He's all right, though, with Yim to\r\npull him through, and they'll make Indian Harbour easy enough.  Then I\r\nshall be reported lost, and after a while Mr. Hepburn will hear the\r\nnews.  Wonder what he thinks has become of me anyhow?  I am following\r\nout instructions, and wintering in Labrador fast enough.  Only I don't\r\nseem to have much time to investigate mining properties, and of course\r\nit's no use trying to find 'em buried under feet of snow.  Perhaps Mr.\r\nBalfour has discovered some while roaming around the country as a\r\nman-wolf.  How absurd to think of 'Voltage' Balfour as a man-wolf!\r\nWonder why he did it?  How I wish he could talk!  Wonder why he can't?\"\r\n\r\nWhile thus cogitating, Cabot had also been climbing a nearby eminence\r\nthat promised a view of the outlying country, but from it he could see\r\nnothing save other hills rising still higher and an unbroken waste of\r\nsnow.\r\n\r\n\"It's no use,\" he sighed.  \"I don't believe I could find them, even if\r\nI had plenty of time.  As it is, I don't dare stay away from Mr.\r\nBalfour any longer.  I'm afraid he's a very sick man, with a slim\r\nchance of ever pulling through.\"\r\n\r\nSo Cabot, after an absence of several hours, turned back towards the\r\nsnug shelter so providentially provided for him, and for which he was\r\njust then more grateful than he could express.  He was thinking of the\r\nmany wonders of the place when he reached its door; but, as he opened\r\nit and stepped inside the room, he was greeted by a greater surprise\r\nthan he had yet encountered.  Nothing was changed about the interior,\r\nand the wounded man lay as Cabot had left him, but with the appearance\r\nof the latter he exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"Thank God, dear lad, that you have come back to me!  It seemed as\r\nthough I should go crazy if left alone a minute longer.\"\r\n\r\nCabot stared in amazement.  \"Is it a miracle?\" he finally asked, \"and\r\nhas your speech been restored to you, or have you been able to speak\r\nall the time?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have been able, but not willing,\" was the reply.  \"I had thought to\r\ndie without speaking to a human being.  I even avoided my fellows,\r\nbelieving myself sufficient unto myself.  But God has punished my\r\narrogance and shown me my weakness.  Until you came no stranger has\r\never set foot within this dwelling, to none have I spoken, and not even\r\nto you did I intend to speak, but with your going my folly became\r\nplain.  I feared you might never return; the horror of living alone,\r\nand the greater horror of dying alone, swept over me.  Then I prayed\r\nfor you to come.  I promised to speak as soon as you were within\r\nhearing.  Every moment since then I have watched for you and longed for\r\nyour coming as a dying man longs for the breath of life.  Promise that\r\nyou will not leave me again.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have already promised, and now I repeat, that I will not leave you\r\nso long as you have need of me,\" replied Cabot.  \"But tell me----\"\r\n\r\n\"I will tell you everything,\" interrupted the wounded man, \"but first\r\nyou must look after the dynamo.  It has stopped, and if you cannot set\r\nit going again we must both perish.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN-WOLF'S STORY.\r\n\r\nAn accident to the dynamo in that place where there was no fuel, and\r\nelectricity must be depended upon for light and heat, was so serious a\r\nmatter that, for a moment, even Cabot's curiosity concerning his host\r\nwas merged in anxiety.\r\n\r\n\"Where shall I find it?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"In the cavern back of this room.  The doorway is behind that bearskin.\r\nThis upper row of keys connects with the storage battery, and the\r\nsecond key controls the lights of the dynamo room.  If there is a bad\r\nbreak I can manage to get to it, but I wouldn't try until you came,\r\nbecause I promised not to move.\"\r\n\r\nAll this was said in a voice that faltered from weakness, and a wave of\r\npity surged in Cabot's breast as he realised how dependent upon him\r\nthis man, so recently a mental as well as a physical giant, had become.\r\n\r\n\"I expect I shall be able to attend to it all right,\" he said\r\ndecisively, as he turned on the stored current that would light the\r\nunknown cavern.  \"At any rate, I shall be able to report the condition\r\nof things, so that you can advise me what to do, or else my training is\r\na greater failure than I think.\"\r\n\r\nWith this he lifted the bearskin, opened a door thus disclosed, and\r\nfound himself in a small, well-lighted cavern that was at once a dynamo\r\nroom, a workshop, and a storehouse for a confused miscellany of\r\narticles.  Without pausing to investigate any of these he went directly\r\nto a dynamo that had been set up at one side and examined it carefully.\r\nIt appeared in perfect order, and the trouble must evidently be sought\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nCabot had wondered by what power the dynamo was driven, and now,\r\nhearing a sound of running water, he stepped in that direction.  A\r\nshort distance away he discovered a swift-flowing subterranean stream,\r\nin which revolved a water wheel of rude, but serviceable, construction.\r\nAs nothing seemed wrong with it, he was obliged to look further, and\r\nfinally found the cause of trouble to be a transmitting belt, the\r\nworn-out lacing of which had parted.  As portions of the belt itself\r\nhad been caught in the pulleys and badly cut, it was necessary to hunt\r\nthrough the pile of material for a new one, and for leather suitable\r\nfor lacing.  Then the new belt must be accurately measured, laced\r\ntogether, and adjusted to its pulleys.\r\n\r\nAlthough the temperature of the cavern was many degrees above that of\r\nthe outside air, it was still so low that Cabot worked slowly and with\r\nnumbed fingers.  Thus more than an hour had elapsed before the dynamo\r\nwas again in running order, and he was at liberty to return to the\r\nliving room.  In the meantime his curiosity concerning this strange\r\nplace of abode and its mysterious tenant was increased by the\r\nremarkable collection of articles stored on all sides.  There was no\r\nend of machinery, tools, and electrical apparatus of all kinds,\r\nincluding miles of copper wire and chemicals for charging batteries.\r\nBesides these, there were ropes, canvas, furniture, boxes, barrels, and\r\nother things too numerous to mention.\r\n\r\n\"What a prize this place would have been for the Indians if they had\r\never discovered it,\" reflected the young engineer.  \"I wonder that he\r\ndared go off and leave it unguarded.\"\r\n\r\nWhen he finally returned to the outer room, he found it even colder\r\nthan the cavern in which he had been working, and realised, as never\r\nbefore, the value of the knowledge that had enabled him to restore the\r\nusefulness of that electric heater.  After getting it into operation,\r\nand making his report to the sick man, who had impatiently awaited him,\r\nthere was another meal to prepare.\r\n\r\nSo, in spite of Cabot's overwhelming desire to hear Mr. Balfour's\r\nstory, there was so much to be done first that the short day had merged\r\ninto another night before the opportunity arrived.  When it came, our\r\nlad drew a chair to the bedside of his patient and said:\r\n\r\n\"Now, sir, if you feel able to talk, and are willing to tell me how you\r\nhappen to be living in this place, I shall be more than glad to listen.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am willing,\" replied the other, \"but must be brief, since talking\r\nhas become an exertion.  As perhaps you know, I was a working\r\nelectrician in London, where, though I had a good business, I had not\r\naccumulated much money.  Consequently I was greatly pleased to receive\r\nwhat promised to be a lucrative contract from a Canadian railway\r\ncompany for supplying and installing a quantity of electrical apparatus\r\nalong their line.  I at once invested every penny I could raise in the\r\npurchase of material and in the charter of a sailing vessel to\r\ntransport it to this country.  On the eve of sailing I married a young\r\nlady to whom I had long been engaged, and, with light hearts, we set\r\nforth on our wedding trip across the Atlantic.\r\n\r\n\"The first two weeks of that voyage were filled with such happiness\r\nthat I trembled for fear it should be snatched from me.  During that\r\ntime we had fair weather and favouring winds.  Then we ran into a gale\r\nthat lasted for days, and drove us far out of our course.  One mast\r\nwent by the board, the other was cut away to save the ship, and, while\r\nin this helpless condition, she struck at night, what I afterwards\r\nlearned to be, a mass of floating ice.  At the time all hands believed\r\nus to be on the coast, and the crew, taking our only seaworthy boat,\r\nput off in a panic, while I was below preparing my wife for departure.\r\nThus deserted, we awaited the death that we expected with each passing\r\nmoment, but it failed to come and the ship still floated.  With\r\nearliest daylight I was on deck, and, to my amazement, saw land on both\r\nsides.  We had been driven into the mouth of a broad estuary, up which\r\nwind and tide were still carrying us.\r\n\r\n\"For three days our helpless drift, to and fro, was continued, and then\r\nour ship grounded on a ledge at the foot of these cliffs.  Getting\r\nashore with little difficulty, we were dismayed to find ourselves in an\r\nuninhabited wilderness, devoid even of vegetation other than moss and\r\nlow growing shrubs.  One of my first discoveries was this cavern with\r\nits subterranean stream of water, and two openings, one of which gives\r\neasy access to the sea.  Knowing that our ship must, sooner or later,\r\ngo to pieces, and desirous of saving what property I might, I rigged up\r\na derrick at the mouth of the cavern, and, with the aid of my brave\r\nwife, transferred everything movable from the wreck; a labour of months.\r\n\r\n\"Winter was now at hand, and, foreseeing that we must spend it where we\r\nwere, I walled up the openings and made all possible preparations to\r\nfight the coming cold.  We burned wood from the wreck while it lasted,\r\nand in the meantime I labored almost night and day at the establishment\r\nof an electric plant.  But the awful winter came and found it still\r\nunfinished, and before the coming of another spring I was left alone.\"\r\n\r\nHere the speaker paused, overcome as much by his feelings as by\r\nweakness, and, during the silence that followed, Cabot stole away,\r\nostensibly to see that the dynamo was running smoothly.  When he\r\nreturned the narrator had recovered his calmness, and was ready to\r\ncontinue his story.\r\n\r\n\"She had never been strong,\" he said, \"and I so cruelly allowed her to\r\noverwork herself that she had no strength left with which to fight the\r\nwinter.  She died in my arms in this very room, and I promised never to\r\nleave her.  Also, after her death, I vowed that my last words to her\r\nshould be my last to any human being, and, until this day, I have kept\r\nthat vow, foolish and wicked though it was.  I have talked and read\r\naloud when alone, but to no man have I spoken.  I have also avoided\r\nintercourse with my fellows, selfishly preferring to nurse my sorrow in\r\nsinful rebellion against God's will.  Now am I justly punished by being\r\nstricken down in the pride of my strength.  At the same time God has\r\nshown his everlasting mercy by sending you to me in the time of my sore\r\nneed.  And you have promised to stay with me until the end, which I\r\nfeel assured is not far off.\"\r\n\r\n\"I trust it may be,\" said Cabot, \"for the world can ill afford to spare\r\na man of your attainments.\"\r\n\r\n\"The world has forgotten me ere this,\" replied Mr. Balfour, with a\r\nfaint smile, \"and has also managed to get along very well without me.\r\nWhether it has or has not I feel that I am shortly to rejoin my dear\r\none.\"\r\n\r\n\"How did it happen?  I mean your wound,\" asked Cabot, abruptly changing\r\nthe subject.  \"Was it an accident?\"\r\n\r\n\"It may have been, but I believe not.  Dressed in wolf skins, I was\r\ncreeping up on a small herd of caribou two days ago, when I was shot by\r\nsome unknown person, probably an Indian hunting the same game, though I\r\nnever saw him.  I managed to crawl home, and as I lay here, filled with\r\nthe horror of dying alone, the ringing of my alarm bell announced a\r\ncoming of either man or beast.  I found strength to turn on the outer\r\nlights and to sound a call for aid on my violin that I hoped would be\r\nheard and understood.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was fortunate for me that you did both those things,\" said Cabot,\r\n\"for I should certainly have remained where I fell after stumbling over\r\nthe wire if it had not been for the combination of light and music.\r\nBut tell me, sir, why have you masqueraded as a man-wolf?\"\r\n\r\n\"For convenience in hunting, as well as to inspire terror in the minds\r\nof savages and keep them at a respectful distance from this place.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have they ever troubled you?\"\r\n\r\n\"At first they were inclined to, but not of late years.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not of late years!   Why, sir, how many years have you dwelt in this\r\nplace?\"\r\n\r\n\"A little more than five.\"\r\n\r\n\"Five years alone and cut off from the world!  I should think you would\r\nfeel like a prisoner shut in a dungeon.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, for I have led the life of my own choice, and it has been full of\r\nactive interests.  I have had to hunt, trap, and fish for my own\r\nsupport.  I have tried to redress some wrongs, and have been able to\r\nrelieve much distress among the improvident natives.  I have busied\r\nmyself with electrical experiments, and have explored the surrounding\r\ncountry for a hundred miles on all sides.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you discovered any indications of mineral wealth during your\r\nexplorations?\" asked the young engineer, recalling his previous thought\r\non this subject.\r\n\r\n\"Quite a number, of which the most important is right here; for this\r\nrange of cliffs is so largely composed of red hematite as to form one\r\nof the richest ore beds in the world.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nCABOT IS LEFT ALONE.\r\n\r\nDeeply interested and affected as Cabot had been by the electrician's\r\nstory, his excitement over its conclusion caused him momentarily to\r\nforget everything else.\r\n\r\n\"Does the ore show anywhere about here?\" he asked eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes.  Lift one of the skins hanging against the wall and you will find\r\nit.  It is better, though, in the lower portions of the inner cavern,\r\nfor the deeper you go the richer it gets.\"\r\n\r\nIn another moment our young engineer was chipping bits of rock from the\r\nnearest wall, and then he must need explore those of the storeroom,\r\nwhere, on a bank of the subterranean stream, he found ore as rich as\r\nany he had ever seen, even in museums.  Returning with hands and\r\npockets full of specimens, he said:\r\n\r\n\"This is the very thing for which I came to Labrador, but have thus far\r\nfailed to find.  Of course I have discovered plenty of indications, for\r\nthe whole country is full of iron, but nowhere else have I found it in\r\nquantity or of a quality that would pay to work.  Here you have both,\r\nand close to a navigable waterway.\"\r\n\r\n\"On which the largest ships may moor to the very cliffs,\" added Mr.\r\nBalfour.\r\n\r\n\"It means a fortune to the owner, and I congratulate you, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear lad, I don't want it!  I am an electrician, not a miner.  Even\r\nif I were inclined to work it, which I am not, I should not be\r\npermitted to do so, for my earthly interests are very nearly ended.\r\nTherefore I cheerfully relinquish in your favour whatever claim I may\r\nhave acquired by discovery or occupation.  If you want it, take it, and\r\nmay God's blessing go with the gift.  Also, under this bed, you will\r\nfind a bag containing more specimens that may interest you.  Of them we\r\nwill talk at another time, for now I am weary.\"\r\n\r\nWith this the man turned his face to the wall, while Cabot, securing\r\nthe bag, quickly became absorbed in an examination of its contents.\r\nAmong these he found rich specimens of iron and copper ores, slabs of\r\nthe rare and exquisitely beautiful Labradorite, with its sheen of\r\npeacock-blue, and even bits of gold-bearing quartz.  For a long time he\r\nexamined and tested these; then, with a sigh of content, he laid them\r\naside and went to bed.  His mission to Labrador was at length\r\naccomplished, and now he had only to get back to New York as quickly as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nBut getting to New York from that place, under existing circumstances,\r\nwas something infinitely easier to plan than to accomplish.  To begin\r\nwith, he had promised to remain with the new-found friend, who was also\r\nso greatly his benefactor, so long as he should be needed, and he meant\r\nto fulfil the promise to the letter.  But to do so taxed his patience\r\nto the utmost; for, in spite of the electrician's belief that he had\r\nnot long to live, the passing of many weeks found his condition but\r\nlittle changed.  At the same time, in spite of Cabot's best nursing and\r\nceaseless attention, he failed to gain strength.\r\n\r\nHaving once broken his years of silence, he now found his greatest\r\npleasure in talking, and Cabot had frequently to interrupt his\r\nconversation on the pretence of taking outside exercise, to prevent him\r\nfrom exhausting himself in that way.  He hated to do this, for Mr.\r\nBalfour's words were always instructive, and he so freely yielded the\r\nestablished secrets of his profession, as well as those of his own\r\nrecent discoveries, to his young friend that Cabot acquired a rich\r\nstore of valuable information during the short days and long nights of\r\nthat Labrador winter.\r\n\r\nWith the apparatus at hand, he was able to conduct many experiments and\r\nput into practice a number of his newly acquired theories.  The sick\r\nman followed these with keenest interest, and aided his pupil with\r\nshrewd suggestions.  At other times they discussed the mineral wealth\r\nof Labrador, and Mr. Balfour drew rough diagrams to show localities\r\nfrom which his various specimens had been brought.  He also gave much\r\ntime to a sketch map of the surrounding country, especially the coast\r\nbetween the place where the \"Sea Bee\" had been left and Indian Harbour,\r\nbeyond which his knowledge did not extend.\r\n\r\nWith these congenial occupations, time never hung heavily in the\r\nwilderness home of the Man-wolf, and, though bitter cold might reign\r\noutside, fierce storms rage, and driving snows pile themselves into\r\nmountainous drifts, neither hunger nor cold could penetrate its snug\r\ninterior, warmed and lighted by the magic of modern science.  With the\r\npassing weeks the old year died and a new one was born.  January merged\r\ninto February, and days began noticeably to lengthen.  Through all\r\nthese weeks Cabot kept up his strength by frequent exercise in the\r\nopen, where, in conflict with storm and cold, he ever won some part of\r\ntheir own ruggedness.  At the same time, his patient grew slowly but\r\nsurely weaker, until at length he could converse only in whispers, and\r\nexperienced such difficulty in swallowing that he had almost ceased to\r\ntake nourishment.  One evening while affairs stood thus, he roused\r\nhimself sufficiently to inquire what day of the month it was.\r\n\r\n\"The thirteenth of February,\" replied Cabot, who had kept careful note\r\nof the calendar.\r\n\r\nInstantly the man brightened, and said, with an unexpected strength of\r\nvoice: \"Six years to-morrow since we were married.  Five years to-day\r\nsince she left me, and to-night I shall rejoin her.  Wish me joy, lad,\r\nfor the long period of our separation is ended.  Good-night, good-bye,\r\nGod bless you!\"\r\n\r\nWith this final utterance, he again lapsed into silence, closed his\r\neyes, and seemed to sleep.  Several times during that night Cabot stole\r\nsoftly to his patient's bedside, but the latter was always asleep, and\r\nhe would not disturb him.  Only in the morning, when daylight revealed\r\nthe marble-like repose of feature, did he know that a glad reunion of\r\nlong parted lovers had been effected, and that it was he who was left\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nAlthough the position in which our lad now found himself was a very\r\ntrying one, he had anticipated and planned for it.  He had no boards\r\nwith which to make a coffin, but there was plenty of stout canvas, and\r\nin a double thickness of this he sewed the body of his friend.  Before\r\ndoing so he dug away the snow beside a cairn of rocks that marked the\r\nlast resting place of her who had gone before, and placed the electric\r\nheater, with extended wire connections, on the ground thus exposed.\r\nWithin a few hours this soil became sufficiently thawed to permit him\r\nto dig a shallow grave, to which, by great effort, he managed to remove\r\nthe shrouded body.  After covering it, and piling above it rocks as\r\nlarge as he could lift, he returned to the empty dwelling, having\r\ncompleted the hardest and saddest day's work of his life.\r\n\r\nSo terrible was the loneliness of that night, and so anxious was Cabot\r\nto take his departure, that he was again astir long before daylight,\r\ncompleting his preparations.  He had previously built a light sled that\r\nhe proposed to drag, and had planned exactly what it should carry.  Now\r\nhe loaded this with a canvas-wrapped package of cooked provisions, a\r\nsleeping bag, a rifle together with a few rounds of ammunition, a light\r\naxe, his precious bag of specimens, and the Man-wolf's electric\r\nflashlight with its battery newly charged.\r\n\r\nWith everything thus in readiness he ate a hearty meal, threw the\r\ndynamo out of gear, closed the door and shutters of the place that had\r\ngiven him the shelter of a home, adjusted the hauling straps of his\r\nsled, and set resolutely forth on his venturesome journey across the\r\nfrozen wilderness.\r\n\r\nIn his mittened hands Cabot carried a stout staff tipped with a\r\nboathook, and this proved of inestimable service in aiding him down the\r\nface of the cliffs to the frozen surface of the estuary; for, by Mr.\r\nBalfour's advice, he had determined to follow the coast line rather\r\nthan attempt the shorter but more uncertain inland route.\r\n\r\nAlthough the distance to be covered was but little over one hundred\r\nmiles, the journey was so beset with difficulties and hardships that\r\nonly our young engineer's splendid physical condition and recently\r\nacquired skill, combined with indomitable pluck, enabled him to\r\naccomplish it.  While he sometimes met with smooth stretches of\r\nsnow-covered ice, it was generally piled in huge wind-rows, incredibly\r\nrugged and difficult to surmount.  Again it would be broken away from\r\nthe base of sheer cliffs, where stretches of open water would\r\nnecessitate toilsome inland detours over or around lofty headlands.  He\r\nwas always buffetted by strong winds, and often halted by blinding\r\nsnowstorms.  He had no fire, no warm food, and no shelter save such as\r\nhe could make by burrowing into snowdrifts.  During the weary hours of\r\none whole night he held a pack of snarling wolves at bay by means of\r\nhis flashlight.  But always he pushed doggedly forward, and after ten\r\ndays of struggle, exhausted almost beyond the power for further effort,\r\nbut immensely proud of his achievement, he reached the goal of his long\r\ndesire.\r\n\r\nIndian Harbour--with its hospital, its church, its two or three houses,\r\nand score of native huts, seemed to our lad almost a metropolis after\r\nhis months of wilderness life, and the welcome he received from its\r\nwarm-hearted inhabitants when he made known his identity was that of\r\none raised from the dead.  White Baldwin and Yim had been there many\r\nweeks earlier, and had reported his disappearance under circumstances\r\nthat left no hope of his ever again being seen alive.  Then the latter\r\nhad set forth on his return journey, while White had joined a mail\r\ncarrier and started for Battle Harbour.\r\n\r\nNow occurred what promised to be a serious interruption to Cabot's\r\nsouthward advance, for no one was proposing to travel in that\r\ndirection, and, in spite of their hospitality, his new acquaintances\r\nwere not inclined to undertake the arduous task of guiding him to\r\nBattle Harbour, 250 miles away, without being well paid for their\r\nlabour, and our young engineer had no money.  Nor, after his recent\r\nexperience, did he care to again encounter the perils of the wilderness\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nBut fortune once more favoured him; for while he was chafing against\r\nthis enforced detention, Dr. Graham Aspland, house surgeon of the\r\nBattle Harbour Hospital, who makes a heroic sledge journey to the far\r\nnorth every winter, arrived on his annual errand of mercy.  He would\r\nset out on his return trip a few days later, and would be more than\r\npleased to have Cabot for a companion.\r\n\r\nThus it happened that one bright day in early March the music of sledge\r\nbells and the cracking of a dog driver's whip attracted the inmates of\r\nthe Battle Harbour Hospital to doors and windows to witness an arrival.\r\nTwo fur-clad figures followed a great travelling sledge, and one of\r\nthem dragged a small sled of his own.  As he came to a halt, and began\r\nwearily to loosen his hauling gear, he cast a glance at one of the\r\nupper windows, and uttered an exclamation of amazement.  Then, with a\r\njoyful cry, he shouted:\r\n\r\n\"Hello!  White, old man!  Run down here and say you're glad I've come!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\nDRIFTING WITH THE ICE PACK.\r\n\r\nCabot had learned from Dr. Aspland of White's arrival at Battle Harbour\r\ntwo months before, with a leg so badly wrenched by slipping into an ice\r\ncrevice that he had gone to the hospital for treatment, but had\r\nexpected that he would long ere this have taken his departure.  At the\r\nsame time White had, of course, given up all hope of ever again seeing\r\nthe friend to whom he had become so deeply attached.  He had been\r\nterribly cut up over Cabot's disappearance on the night of the\r\nblizzard, and, with the faithful Yim, had spent days in searching for\r\nhim.  They had gone back to the timber, only to find the Indian camp\r\ndeserted, and that its recent occupants had made a hasty departure.\r\nFinally they had given over the hopeless search and had sadly continued\r\ntheir southward journey.\r\n\r\nNow to again behold Cabot alive and well filled poor White with such\r\njoyful amazement that for some minutes he could not frame an\r\nintelligent sentence.  He flew down to where the new arrival still\r\nstruggled with his hauling gear, and flung himself so impulsively upon\r\nhim that both rolled over in the snow.  There, with gasping\r\nexclamations of delight, they wrestled themselves into a mood of\r\ncomparative calmness that enabled them to regain their feet and begin\r\nto ask questions.\r\n\r\nFor some time White had been sufficiently recovered to resume his\r\njourney, had an opportunity offered for so doing, but, as none had come\r\nto him, he had earned his board by acting as nurse in the hospital.  If\r\nhe had been anxious to depart before, he was doubly so now that he had\r\nregained his comrade, and Cabot fully shared his impatience of further\r\ndelay.  But how they were to reach the coast of Newfoundland they could\r\nnot imagine.  It would still be many weeks before vessels of any kind\r\ncould be expected at Battle Harbour, and they had no money with which\r\nto undertake the expensive journey by way of Quebec.\r\n\r\n\"If only the ocean would freeze over, we could walk home!\" exclaimed\r\nCabot one day, as the two friends sat gloomily discussing their\r\nprospects.  And then that very thing came to pass.\r\n\r\nA dog sledge arrived from Forteau, that same evening, bringing a\r\nwounded man to the hospital for treatment, and its driver reported the\r\nStrait of Belle Isle as being so solidly packed with ice that several\r\npersons had traversed it from shore to shore.\r\n\r\n\"If others have made the trip, why can't we?\" cried Cabot.\r\n\r\n\"I am willing to try it, if you are,\" replied White, and by daylight of\r\nthe following morning the impatient lads were on their way up the coast\r\nin search of the ice bridge to Newfoundland.  Cabot had traded his\r\nelectric flashlight for a supply of provisions sufficient to load his\r\nsled, which they took turns at hauling, and four days after leaving\r\nBattle Harbour they reached L'Anse au Loup.  At that point the strait\r\nis only a dozen miles wide, and there, if anywhere, they could cross\r\nit.  It was midday when they came to the winter huts of L'Anse au Loup,\r\nand they had intended remaining in one of them over night, but a short\r\nconversation with its owner caused them to change their plans.\r\n\r\n\"Yas, there be solid pack clear to ither side all right,\" he said, \"but\r\nhappen it 'll go out any time.  Fust change o' wind 'll loose it, and\r\none's to be looked for.  Ah wouldn't resk it on no account mahself, but\r\nif Ah had it to do, Ah'd go in a hurry 'ithout wasting no time.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a case of necessity with us,\" said Cabot.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" agreed White, \"we simply must go, and the quicker we set about\r\nit the better.  If we make haste I believe we can get across by dark.\"\r\n\r\nThus determined, and disregarding a further expostulation from the\r\nfisherman, our lads set their faces resolutely towards the confusion of\r\nhummocks, \"pans,\" floes tilted on edge, and up-reared masses of blue\r\nice forming the \"strait's pack\" of that season.  Five minutes later\r\nthey were lost to sight amid the frozen chaos.\r\n\r\n\"Wal,\" soliloquized the man left standing on shore, \"Ah 'opes they'll\r\nmake it, but it's a fearsome resk, an' Gawd 'elp 'em if come a shift o'\r\nwind afore they're over.\"\r\n\r\nNothing, in all their previous experience of Labrador travel, had\r\nequalled the tumultuous ruggedness of the way by which Cabot and White\r\nwere now attempting to bridge that boisterous arm of the stormy\r\nnorthern ocean, and to advance at all taxed their strength to the\r\nutmost.  To transport their laden sled was next to impossible, but they\r\ndared not leave it behind, and with their progress thus impeded they\r\nwere barely half way to the Newfoundland coast when night overtook\r\nthem.  Even though the gathering darkness had not compelled a halt,\r\ntheir utter exhaustion would have demanded a rest.  For an hour White\r\nhad been obliged to clinch his teeth to keep from crying out with the\r\npain of his weakened, and now overstrained, ankle, and when Cabot\r\nannounced that it was no use trying to get further before morning, he\r\nsank to the ice with a groan.\r\n\r\nFull of sympathy for his comrade's suffering, the Yankee lad at once\r\nset to work to make him as comfortable as circumstances would permit,\r\nand soon had him lying on a sleeping bag, in a niche formed by two\r\nuptilted slabs of ice.  Profiting by past experience, they had procured\r\nand brought with them an Eskimo lamp with its moss wick, a small\r\nquantity of seal oil, and a supply of matches, so that, after a while,\r\nCabot procured enough boiling water to furnish a small pot of tea.\r\nWhen they had eaten their simple meal of tea, hard bread, and pemmican,\r\nWhite's ankle was bathed with water as hot as he could bear it, and\r\nthen the weary lads turned in for such sleep as their cheerless\r\nquarters might yield.  About midnight the wind that had for many days\r\nblown steadily from the eastward changed to northwest, and, with the\r\ncoming of daylight, it was blowing half a gale from that direction.\r\n\r\nTo Cabot this change meant little or nothing, and he was suggesting\r\nthat they remain where they were until White's leg should be thoroughly\r\nrested, when the other interrupted him with:\r\n\r\n\"But we can't stay here.  Don't you feel the change of wind?\"\r\n\r\n\"What of it?\" asked Cabot.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, nothing at all, only that it will drive the ice out to sea, and,\r\nif we haven't reached land before it begins to move, we'll go with it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't mean it!\" cried Cabot, now thoroughly alarmed.  \"In that\r\ncase we'd best get a move on in a hurry.  Do you think your leg will\r\nstand the trip?\"\r\n\r\n\"It will have to,\" rejoined White, grimly; and a few minutes later they\r\nhad resumed the toilsome progress that was now a race for life.  But it\r\nwas a snail's race, for the task of moving the sled had devolved\r\nentirely upon Cabot, White having all he could do to drag himself\r\nalong.  Each step gave him such exquisite pain that, by the time they\r\nhad accomplished a couple of miles, he was crawling on hands and knees.\r\n\r\nStill, as Cabot hopefully pointed out, the Newfoundland coast was in\r\nplain sight, and the ice held as firm as ever.  He had hardly spoken\r\nwhen there came a distant roaring, that quickly developed into a sound\r\nof crashing and grinding not to be mistaken.\r\n\r\n\"The ice is moving!\" gasped White.\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said Cabot bravely, \"we'll move too.  Come on, old man.  We'll\r\nleave the sled, and I'll get you ashore even if I have to carry you.\r\nIt isn't so very far now.\"\r\n\r\nWith this the speaker disengaged his hauling straps and turned to\r\nassist his comrade, but, to his dismay, the latter lay on the ice pale\r\nand motionless.  What with pain, over-exertion, and excitement, White\r\nhad fainted, and Cabot must either carry him to the shore, remain\r\nbeside him until he recovered, or leave him to his fate and save\r\nhimself by flight over the still unbroken ice.  He tried the first\r\nplan, picked White up, staggered a few steps with his helpless burden,\r\nand discovered its futility.  Then he proceeded to put the second into\r\nexecution by calmly unloading the sled and making such arrangements as\r\nhis slender means would allow for his comrade's comfort.  The third\r\nplan came to him merely as a thought, to be promptly dismissed as\r\nunworthy of consideration.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the ominous sounds of cracking, grinding, rending, and\r\nsplitting grew ever louder, and came ever closer, until, at length,\r\nCabot could see and feel that the ice all about him was in motion.  By\r\nthe time White recovered consciousness, a broad lane of black water had\r\nopened between that place and the Newfoundland coast, while others\r\ncould be seen in various directions.\r\n\r\n\"What are you doing?\" asked White, feebly, after he had struggled back\r\nto a knowledge of passing events, and had, for some minutes, been\r\nwatching his friend's movements.\r\n\r\n\"Building an igloo,\" answered Cabot, cheerily.  \"We might as well be\r\ncomfortable while we can, and though my hut won't have the\r\narchitectural beauty that Yim could give it, I believe it will keep us\r\nwarm.\"\r\n\r\nIt would have been more than easy, and perfectly natural, under the\r\ncircumstances, to give way to utter despair; for of the several\r\nhopeless situations in which our lads had been placed during the past\r\nfew months, the present was, by far, the worst.  At any moment the ice\r\nbeneath them might open and drop them into fathomless waters.  Even if\r\nit held fast, they were certainly being carried out to sea, where they\r\nwould be exposed to furious gales that must ultimately work their\r\ndestruction.  In spite of all this, Cabot Grant insisted on remaining\r\nhopefully cheerful.  He said he had squeezed out of just as tight\r\nplaces before, and believed he would get out of this one somehow.  At\r\nany rate, as crying wouldn't help it, he wasn't going to cry.  Besides\r\nall sorts of things might happen.  They might drift ashore somewhere or\r\ninto the track of passing steamers.  Wouldn't it be fine to be picked\r\nup and carried straight to New York?  If steamers failed them, they\r\nwere almost certain to sight fishing boats sooner or later.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" added White, catching some of his companion's hopefulness, \"or\r\nwe may meet with the sealers who leave St. Johns about this time every\r\nyear and hunt seals on the ice pack off shore.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" agreed the other.  \"So what's the use of worrying?\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of the brave front and cheerful aspect that Cabot maintained\r\nbefore his helpless comrade, he often broke down when off by himself,\r\nvainly straining his eyes from the summit of some ice hummock for any\r\nhopeful sign, and acknowledged that their situation was indeed\r\ndesperate.\r\n\r\nThat first night, spent sleeplessly and in momentary expectation that\r\nthe ice beneath them would break, was the worst.  After that they\r\ndreaded more than anything the fate that would overtake them with the\r\ndisappearance of their slender stock of provisions.  While this\r\ndiminished with alarming rapidity, despite their efforts at economy,\r\ntheir ice island drifted out from the strait, and soon afterwards\r\nbecame incorporated with the great Arctic pack that always in the\r\nspring forces its resistless way steadily south-ward towards the\r\nmelting waters of the Gulf Stream.\r\n\r\nLand had disappeared with the second day of the ice movement, and after\r\nthat, for a week, nothing occurred to break the terrible monotony of\r\nlife on the pack, as experienced by our young castaways.  Then came the\r\ndreaded announcement that one portion of their supplies was exhausted.\r\nThere was no longer a drop of oil for their lamp.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\nTHE COMING OF DAVID GIDGE.\r\n\r\nWhite, who was still confined to the hut with his strained ankle,\r\nannounced that they no longer had any oil upon Cabot's return at dusk\r\nfrom a day of fruitless hunting and outlook duty on the ice.\r\n\r\n\"That's bad,\" replied the latter, in a tone whose cheerfulness strove\r\nto conceal his anxiety.  \"Now we'll have to burn the sled.  Lucky thing\r\nfor us that it's of wood instead of being one of those bone affairs\r\nsuch as we saw at Locked Harbour.\"\r\n\r\n\"Our provisions are nearly gone too,\" added White.  \"In fact we've only\r\nenough for one more day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, well!  A lot of things can happen in a day, and some of them may\r\nhappen to us.\"\r\n\r\nBut the only thing worthy of note that happened on the following day\r\nwas a storm of such violence as to compel even stout-hearted Cabot to\r\nremain behind the sheltering walls of the hut, and, while it raged, our\r\nshivering lads, crouched above a tiny blaze of sled wood, ate their\r\nlast morsel of food.  They still had a small quantity of tea, but that\r\nwas all.  As soon, therefore, as the storm abated Cabot sallied forth\r\nwith his gun, still hopeful, in spite of many disappointments, of\r\nfinding some bird or beast that, by a lucky shot, might be brought to\r\nthe table.\r\n\r\nThe ice pack was of such vast extent that it seemed as though it must\r\nsupport animal life of some kind, but Cabot traversed it that day for\r\nmany miles without finding so much as a track or a feather.  That\r\nnight's supper was a pot of tea, and a similar one formed the sole\r\nnourishment upon which Cabot again set forth the next morning for\r\nanother of those weary hunts.\r\n\r\nThis time he went further from the hut than he had dared go on previous\r\nexpeditions; but on them he had been hopeful and knew that even though\r\nhe failed in his hunting he would still find food awaiting him on his\r\nreturn.  Now he was desperate with hunger, and the knowledge that\r\nfailing in his present effort he would not have strength for another.\r\nIn his mind, too, he carried a vivid picture of poor White, crouching\r\nin that wretched hut over an expiring blaze fed by the very last of\r\ntheir wood.\r\n\r\n\"I simply can't go back empty-handed!\" he cried aloud.  \"It would be\r\nbetter not to go back at all, and let him hope for my coming to the\r\nlast.\"\r\n\r\nSo the young hunter pushed wearily and hopelessly on, until he found\r\nhimself at the foot of a line of icebergs that had been frozen into the\r\npack, where they resembled a range of fantastically shaped hills.\r\nCabot had seen them from a distance on a previous expedition, and had\r\nwondered what lay beyond.  Now he determined to find out, though he\r\nknew if he once crossed them there would be little chance of regaining\r\nthe hut before dark.  It was a laborious climb, and several times he\r\nslid back to the place of starting, but each mishap of this kind only\r\nmade him the more determined to gain the top.  At length, breathless\r\nand bruised, crawling on hands and knees, he reached a point from which\r\nhe could look beyond the barrier.  As he did so, he turned sick and\r\nuttered a choking cry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: He reached a point from which he could look beyond the\r\nbarrier.]\r\n\r\nWhat he saw in that first glance was so utterly incredible that it\r\ncould not be true, though if it were it would be the most welcome and\r\nbeautiful sight in all the world.  Yet it was only a ship!  Just one\r\nship and a lot of men!  The ship was not even a handsome one, being\r\nmerely a three-masted steam sealer, greasy and smeared in every part\r\nwith coal soot from her tall smoke stack.  She lay a mile or so away,\r\nbut well within the pack, through the outer edge of which she had\r\nforced a passage.  The men, evidently her crew, who were on the ice\r\nnear the foot of Cabot's ridge, were a disreputable looking lot,\r\nragged, dirty, unkempt, and as bloody as so many butchers.  And that is\r\nexactly what they were--butchers engaged in their legitimate business\r\nof killing the seals that, coming up from the south to meet the\r\ndrifting ice pack, had crawled out on it by thousands to rear their\r\nyoung.\r\n\r\nThis was all that Cabot saw; yet the sight so affected him that he\r\nlaughed and sobbed for joy.  Then he stood up, and, with glad tears\r\nblinding his eyes, tried to shout to the men beneath him, but could\r\nonly utter hoarse whispers; for, in his overpowering happiness, he had\r\nalmost lost the power of speech.  As he could not call to them he began\r\nto wave his arms to attract their attention, and then, all at once, he\r\nwas nearly paralysed by a hail from close at hand of:\r\n\r\n\"Hello there, ye bloomin' idjit!  Wot's hup?\"\r\n\r\nWhirling around, Cabot saw, standing only a few rods away, a man who\r\nhad evidently just climbed the opposite side of the ridge.  He\r\nrecognised him in an instant, as he must have done had he met him in\r\nthe most crowded street of a great city, so distinctively peculiar was\r\nhis figure.\r\n\r\n\"David!  David Gidge!\" he gasped, recovering his voice for the effort,\r\nand in another moment, flinging his arms about the astonished mariner's\r\nneck, he was pouring out a flood of incoherent words.\r\n\r\n\"Wal, I'll be jiggered!\" remarked Mr. Gidge, as he disengaged himself\r\nfrom Cabot's impulsive embrace and stepped back for a more\r\ncomprehensive view.  \"Your voice sounds familiar, Mister, but I can't\r\nsay as I ever seen you before.  I took ye fust off fer a b'ar, and then\r\nfer a Huskie.  When I seen you was white, I 'lowed ye might be one of\r\nthe 'Marmaid's' crew, seeing as she was heading fer the pack 'bout the\r\ntime we struck it.  Now, though, as I say, I'm jiggered ef I know\r\nexectly who ye be.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, Mr. Gidge, I'm Cabot Grant, who----\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course.  To be sartin!  Now I know ye!\" interrupted the other.\r\n\"But where's White?  What hev ye done with Whiteway Baldwin?\"\r\n\r\n\"He's back there on the ice helpless with a crippled leg, freezing and\r\nstarving to death; but if you'll come at once I'll show you the way,\r\nand we may still be in time to save him.\"\r\n\r\nWith instant comprehension of the necessity for prompt action, Mr.\r\nGidge, who, as Cabot afterwards learned, was first mate of the sealer\r\n\"Labrador,\" turned and shouted in stentorian tones to the men who were\r\nworking below:\r\n\r\n\"Knock off, all hands, and follow me.  Form a line and keep hailing\r\ndistance apart, so's we'll find our way back after dark.  There's white\r\nmen starving on the ice.  One of ye go to the ship and report.  Move\r\nlively!  Now, lad, I'm ready.\"\r\n\r\nTwo hours later Cabot and David Gidge, with, a long line of men\r\nstreaming out behind them, reached the little hut.  There was no answer\r\nto the cheery shouts with which they approached it, and, as they\r\ncrawled through its low entrance, they were filled with anxious\r\nmisgivings.  What if they were too late after all?  No spark of fire\r\nlighted the gloom or took from the deadly chill of the interior, and no\r\nvoice bade them welcome.  But, as David Gidge struck a match, a low\r\nmoaning sounded from one side, and told them that White was at least\r\nalive.\r\n\r\nIt took but a minute to remove him from the hut, together with the few\r\nthings worth taking away that it contained.  Then it was left without a\r\nshadow of regret, and the march to the distant ship was begun.  Four\r\nmen carried White, who seemed to have sunk into a stupor, while two\r\nmore supported Cabot, who had become suddenly weak and so weary that he\r\nbegged to be allowed to sleep where he was.\r\n\r\n\"It's been a close call for both of 'em,\" said David Gidge, \"and now,\r\nmen, we've got to make the quickest kind of time getting 'em back to\r\nthe ship.\"\r\n\r\nFortunately there were plenty of willing hands to which the burdens\r\nmight be shifted, for the \"Labrador\" carried a crew two hundred strong,\r\nand, as the little party moved swiftly from one shouting man to\r\nanother, it constantly gained accessions.\r\n\r\nAt length the sealer was reached, and the rescued lads were taken to\r\nher cabin, where the ship's doctor, having made every possible\r\npreparation for their reception, awaited them.  They were given hot\r\ndrinks, rubbed, fed, and placed between warm blankets, where poor,\r\nweary Cabot was at last allowed to fall asleep without further\r\ninterruption.\r\n\r\nThe animal sought by the sealers of Newfoundland amid the furious\r\nstorms and crashing floes of the great ice pack is not the fur-bearing\r\nseal of Alaska, but a variety of the much less important hair seal,\r\nwhich may be seen almost anywhere along the Atlantic coast.  From its\r\nskin seal leather is made, but it is chiefly valuable for the oil\r\nyielded by the layer of fat lying directly beneath the skin and\r\nenveloping the entire body.  These seals would hardly be worth hunting\r\nunless they could be captured easily and in quantities; but, on their\r\nnative ice in early spring, the young seals are found in prime\r\ncondition and in vast numbers.  Each helpless victim is killed by a\r\nblow on the head, \"sculped\" or stripped of his pelt, and the flayed\r\nbody is left lying in a pool of its own blood.\r\n\r\nThe crew of a single vessel will thus destroy thousands of seals in a\r\nday, and in some prosperous years the total kill of seals has passed\r\nthe half million mark.  Now only about a dozen steamers are engaged in\r\nthe business, but by them from 200,000 to 300,000 seals are destroyed\r\neach spring.  The movements of sealing vessels are governed by rigidly\r\nenforced laws that forbid them to leave port before the 12th of March,\r\nto kill a seal before the 14th of the same month, or after the 20th of\r\nApril, and prohibit any steamer from making more than one trip during\r\nthis short open season.  The crews are paid in shares of the catch, and\r\nmen are never difficult to obtain for the work, as the sealing season\r\ncomes when there is nothing else to be done.\r\n\r\nAs March was not yet ended when our lads were received aboard the\r\n\"Labrador,\" and as she would not return to port until the last minute\r\nof the open season had expired, they had before them nearly a month in\r\nwhich to recover their exhausted energies and learn the business of\r\nsealing.  White had suffered so severely, and reached such a precarious\r\ncondition, that he required every day of the allotted time for\r\nrecuperation, and even at its end his strength was by no means fully\r\nrestored.  Cabot, on the other hand, woke after a thirty-six-hour nap,\r\nravenously hungry, and as fit as ever for anything that might offer.\r\nAfter that, although he could never bring himself to assist in clubbing\r\nbaby seals to death, he took an active part in the other work of the\r\nship, thereby fully repaying the cost of the food eaten by himself and\r\nWhite.\r\n\r\nOf course, with their very first opportunity, both lads eagerly plied\r\nDavid Gidge with questions concerning the welfare of the Baldwin family\r\nand everything that had happened during their long absence.  Thus they\r\nlearned to their dismay that another suit had been brought against the\r\nBaldwin estate that threatened to swallow what little property had been\r\nleft, and that White, having been convicted of contempt of court for\r\ncontinuing the lobster factory after an adverse decision had been\r\nrendered, was now liable to a fine of one thousand dollars, or\r\nimprisonment, as soon as he landed.\r\n\r\n\"But what has become of my mother and sister?\" asked White.\r\n\r\n\"They are in Harbour Grace,\" answered David Gidge, \"stopping with some\r\nkin of mine.  You see, all three of us was brung to St. Johns as\r\nwitnesses, and there wasn't money enough to take us back till I could\r\ncome sealing and make some.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are a trump, David Gidge!\" exclaimed Cabot, while White gratefully\r\nsqueezed the honest fellow's hand.\r\n\r\n\"I promised to look arter 'em till you come back,\" said the sailorman,\r\nsimply.\r\n\r\nAt length the sealing season closed, and the prow of the \"Labrador\" was\r\nturned homeward, but even now, after many an anxious discussion, our\r\nlads were undecided as to what they should do upon landing.  But a\r\nsolution of the problem came to Cabot on the day that the steamer\r\nentered Conception Bay and anchored close off Bell Island, to await the\r\nmoving of a great ice mass that had drifted into the harbour.\r\n\r\n\"I know what we'll do!\" he cried.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\nASSISTANT MANAGER OF THE MAN-WOLF MINE.\r\n\r\nAs the deeply laden sealer drew near to land, Cabot had impatiently\r\nscanned the coast of the great island that he had once thought so remote,\r\nbut which, after his long sojourn in the Labrador wilderness, now seemed\r\nalmost the same as New York itself.  When the \"Labrador\" entered\r\nConception Bay, at the head of which lies Harbour Grace, her home port,\r\nand was forced by ice to anchor, he inquired concerning a small island\r\nthat lay close at hand.\r\n\r\n\"Bell Island,\" he repeated meditatively, on being told its name.  \"Isn't\r\nthere an iron mine on it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sartain,\" replied David Gidge.  \"The whole island is mostly made of\r\niron.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then it is a place that I particularly want to visit, and I know what we\r\nwill do.  Of course, White, we can't let you go to prison, but at the\r\nsame time you haven't, immediately available, the money with which to pay\r\nthat fine.  I have, though, right in St. Johns.  So, if you will endorse\r\nthat New York draft to me, I will carry it into the city, deposit it at\r\nthe bank, draw out the cash, and take the first train for Harbour Grace,\r\nso as to be there with more than enough money to pay your fine when you\r\narrive.  After that I propose that we both go on to New York, where I am\r\nalmost certain I can get you something to do that will pay even better\r\nthan a lobster factory.  If that plan strikes you as all right, and if\r\nMr. Gidge will set me ashore here, I'll just take a look at Bell Island\r\nand then hurry on to St. Johns.\"\r\n\r\nThe plan appearing feasible to White, Cabot--taking with him only his bag\r\nof specimens, to which he intended to add others of the Bell Island\r\nore--bade his friends a temporary farewell, and was set ashore.  As the\r\ncountry was still covered with snow, he had slung his snowshoes on his\r\nback, and as he was still clad in the well-worn fur garments that had\r\nbeen so necessary in Labrador, his appearance was sufficiently striking\r\nto attract attention as soon as he landed.  One of the very first persons\r\nwho spoke to him proved to be the young superintendent of the mine he\r\nwished to visit, and, when this gentleman learned that Cabot had just\r\nreturned from Labrador, he offered him every hospitality.  Not only did\r\nhe show him over the mine and give him all possible information\r\nconcerning it, but he kept him over night in his own bachelor quarters,\r\nand provided a boat to take him across to Portugal Cove on the mainland\r\nin the morning.\r\n\r\nFrom that point, there being no conveyance, Cabot was forced to walk the\r\nnine miles into St. Johns, which city he did not reach until nearly noon.\r\nEven there, where fur-clad Arctic explorers are not uncommon, Cabot's\r\ncostume attracted much attention.  Disregarding this, he inquired his way\r\nto the Bank of Nova Scotia, where he presented the letter of credit that\r\nhe had carefully treasured amid all the vicissitudes of the past ten\r\nmonths.  The paying teller of the bank examined it closely, and then took\r\na long look at the remarkable-appearing young man who had presented it.\r\nFinally he said curtly:\r\n\r\n\"Sign your name.\"\r\n\r\nCabot did so, and the other, after comparing the two signatures, retired\r\nto an inner room.  From it he reappeared a few moments later and\r\nrequested Cabot to follow him inside, where the manager wished to see him.\r\n\r\nThe manager also regarded our lad with great curiosity as he said:\r\n\r\n\"You have retained this letter a long time without presenting it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I might have retained it longer if I had not been in need of money,\"\r\nrejoined Cabot, somewhat nettled by the man's manner.\r\n\r\n\"You are Cabot Grant of New York?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not yet of age?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not quite.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you have a guardian?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you mind telling his name and address?\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that a necessary preliminary to drawing money on a letter of credit?\"\r\n\r\n\"In this case it is.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, he is James Hepburn, President of the Gotham Trust and\r\nInvestment Company.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just so, and you will doubtless be interested in this communication from\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, the manager handed over the telegram in which Mr. Hepburn\r\ninstructed the St. Johns branch of the Bank of Nova Scotia to advance\r\nonly the price of a ticket to New York on a letter of credit that would\r\nbe presented by his ward, Cabot Grant.\r\n\r\n\"What does it mean?\" asked Cabot in bewilderment, as he finished reading\r\nthis surprising order.\r\n\r\n\"I've no idea,\" replied the manager dryly.  \"I only know that we are\r\nbound to follow those instructions, and can let you have but forty\r\ndollars, which is the price of a first-class ticket to New York by\r\nsteamer.  Moreover, as this is sailing day, and the New York steamer\r\nleaves in a couple of hours, I would advise you to engage passage and go\r\non board at once, if you do not want to be indefinitely detained here.\"\r\n\r\n\"In what way?\"\r\n\r\n\"Possibly by the sheriff, who has wanted you for some time in connection\r\nwith a certain French Shore lobster case that the government is\r\nprosecuting.\"\r\n\r\nPerplexed and indignant as he was, Cabot realised that only in New York\r\ncould his tangled affairs be straightened out, and that the quicker he\r\ngot there the better.  Determined, however, to make one more effort in\r\nbehalf of his friend, he produced the missionary's draft and asked if the\r\nmanager would cash it.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly not,\" replied that individual promptly.  \"Under present\r\ncircumstances, Mr. Grant, we must decline to have any business dealings\r\nwith you other than to accept your receipt for forty dollars, which will\r\nbe paid you in the outer office.\"\r\n\r\nSo Cabot swallowed his pride, took what he could get, and left the bank a\r\nlittle more downcast than he had been at any time since the day on which\r\nPresident Hepburn had entrusted him with his present mission.\r\n\r\n\"I don't understand it at all,\" he muttered to himself, as he sought an\r\neating-house, where he proposed to expend a portion of his money in\r\nsatisfying his keen appetite.  \"Seems to me it is a mighty mean return\r\nfor all I have gone through, and Mr. Hepburn will have to explain matters\r\npretty clearly when I get back to New York.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the eating-house Cabot sent a letter to White, explaining his\r\ninability to secure the money he had expected, begging him to lie low for\r\na few days, and announcing his own immediate departure for New York, from\r\nwhich place he promised to send back the amount of the draft immediately\r\nupon his arrival.  In this letter Cabot also enclosed fifteen dollars,\r\njust to help White out until he could send him some more money.  This\r\noutlay left our young engineer but twenty-five dollars, but that would\r\npay for a steerage passage, which, he reflected, would be plenty good\r\nenough for one in his reduced circumstances, and leave a few dollars for\r\nemergencies when he reached New York.\r\n\r\nTwo hours later, still clutching the bag of specimens that now formed his\r\nsole luggage, he stood on the forward deck of the steamer \"Amazon\" as she\r\nslipped through the narrow passage leading out from the land-locked\r\nharbour, gazing back at the city of St. Johns climbing its steep hillside\r\nand dominated by the square towers of its Roman Catholic cathedral.  He\r\nwas feeling very forlorn and lonely, and was wondering how he should\r\nmanage to exist on steerage fare in steerage company during the next five\r\ndays, when a familiar voice, close at hand, said:\r\n\r\n\"Hello, young man in furs!  Where do you come from?  Been to the North\r\nPole with Peary?\"\r\n\r\nTurning quickly, Cabot gasped out:\r\n\r\n\"Captain Phinney!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, not cap'n, but second mate Phinney,\" retorted the other.  \"But how\r\ndo you know my name?  I don't recognise you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am Cabot Grant, who was with you on the 'Lavinia' when----\"\r\n\r\n\"Good heavens, man!  It can't be.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is, though, and I never was more glad to see any one, not even David\r\nGidge, than I am to see you at this minute.  But why are you second mate\r\ninstead of captain?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because,\" replied the other bitterly, \"it was the only berth they would\r\ngive me after I lost my ship, and I had to take it or beg.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I thought you went down with the 'Lavinia'?\"\r\n\r\n\"So I thought you did, but it seems both of us were mistaken.  All but\r\nyou got off in two of the boats, and ours was picked up the next day by a\r\nliner bound for New York.  But how, in the name of all that is\r\nwonderful--  Hold on, though.  Let us go up to my room, where we can talk\r\ncomfortably.\"\r\n\r\nAs a result of this happy meeting, Cabot's voyage was made very pleasant\r\nafter all.  Much as he had to tell and to hear, he also found time to\r\nwrite out a full report on the Bell Island mine, and also a series of\r\nnotes concerning the ore specimens that he was carrying to New York.\r\n\r\nAt length the great city was reached, the \"Amazon\" was made fast to her\r\nBrooklyn pier, and Cabot went to bid the second mate good-bye.  \"Hold on\r\na bit,\" said the latter, \"and run up to the house with me.  You can't go\r\nwithout seeing Nelly and the baby.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nice calling rig I've got on, haven't I?\" laughed Cabot.  \"Why, it would\r\nscare 'em stiff.  So not to-day, thank you; but I'll come to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nThe carriage that Cabot engaged to carry him across to the city cost him\r\nhis last cent of money, but he knew it was well worth it when, still in\r\nfurs and with his snowshoes still strapped to his back, he entered the\r\nGotham building.  Such a sensation did he create that he would have been\r\nmobbed in another minute had he not dodged into an elevator and said:\r\n\r\n\"President's room, please.\"\r\n\r\nHe so petrified Mr. Hepburn's clerks and office boys by his remarkable\r\nappearance that they neglected to check his progress, and allowed him to\r\nwalk unchallenged into the sacred private office.  Its sole occupant was\r\nwriting, and did not notice the entrance until Cabot, laying a folded\r\npaper on his desk, said:\r\n\r\n\"Here is that Bell Island report, Mr. Hepburn.\"\r\n\r\nThe startled man sprang to his feet with a face as pale as though he had\r\nseen a ghost, and for a few moments stared in speechless amazement at the\r\nfur-clad intruder.  Then the light of recognition flashed into his eyes,\r\nand holding out a cordial hand he said:\r\n\r\n\"My dear boy, how you frightened me!  Where on earth did you come from?\"\r\n\r\n\"From the steerage of the steamer 'Amazon,'\" replied Cabot, stiffly,\r\nignoring his guardian's proffered hand.  \"I only dropped in to hand you\r\nthat Bell Island report, and to say that, as this happens to be my\r\ntwenty-first birthday, I shall be pleased to receive whatever of my\r\nproperty you may still hold in trust at your earliest convenience.  With\r\nthat business transacted, it is perhaps needless to add, that I shall\r\ntrouble no further the man who was cruel enough to leave me penniless\r\namong strangers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Cabot, are you crazy, or what do you mean?  I received your Bell Island\r\nreport months ago, and it was that caused me to recall you.  Why did you\r\nnot come at once?\"\r\n\r\n\"I never sent a Bell Island report.  In fact I never wrote one until\r\nyesterday, and there it lies.  Nor did I ever receive any notice of\r\nrecall, and I did not come back sooner because I have been following your\r\ninstructions and wintering in Labrador.  There I have acquired one of the\r\nmost remarkable iron properties in the world, which I intend to develop\r\nas far as possible with my own resources, seeing that not one cent of\r\nyour money has been used in defraying the expenses of my recent trip,\"\r\nreplied Cabot, hotly.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Hepburn did not hear the last of this speech, for he had opened\r\nthe report laid on his desk and was glancing rapidly through it.\r\n\r\n\"This is exactly what I expected and wanted!\" he exclaimed.  \"Why didn't\r\nyou send it in before, instead of that other one?\"\r\n\r\n\"I never sent any other,\" repeated Cabot, and then they sat down to\r\nmutual explanations.\r\n\r\nFor that whole morning President Hepburn denied himself to all callers\r\nand devoted his entire attention to Cabot's recital.  When it was\r\nfinished, and when the bag full of specimens had been examined, the elder\r\nman grasped the other's hand and said:\r\n\r\n\"My dear boy, you have done splendidly!  I am not only satisfied with you\r\nas an agent, but am proud of you as a ward.  Yes, this is your day of\r\nfreedom from our guardianship, and I shall take pleasure in turning over\r\nto you the balance of the property left by your father.  It, together\r\nwith the balance remaining on your letter of credit, and your salary for\r\nthe past year, will amount to about ten thousand dollars, a portion of\r\nwhich at least I would advise you to invest in the Man-wolf mine.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"My dear boy, you have done splendidly!\"]\r\n\r\n\"Then you intend to develop it, sir?\" cried Cabot.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, provided we can acquire your claim to the property, and\r\nengage a certain Mr. Cabot Grant to act as our assistant Labrador\r\nmanager.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think me capable of filling so responsible a position, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am convinced of it,\" replied Mr. Hepburn, smiling.\r\n\r\n\"And may I find places for White, and David Gidge, and Captain Phinney,\r\nand----\"\r\n\r\n\"One of the duties of your new position will be the selection of your\r\nsubordinates,\" interrupted the other, \"and I should hope you would give\r\npreference to those whose fidelity you have already tested.\"\r\n\r\nWithin an hour after this happy conclusion of the interview, Cabot had\r\nwired White Baldwin the full amount of the missionary's draft and invited\r\nhim to come as quickly as possible to New York.  He had also written to\r\nCaptain Phinney asking him to resign at once his position as second mate,\r\nin order that he might assume command of a steamer shortly to be put on a\r\nrun between New York and Labrador.\r\n\r\nWith these pleasant duties performed, our young engineer prepared to\r\naccept President Hepburn's invitation to a dinner that was to be given in\r\nhis honour, and with which the happiest day of his life was to be\r\nconcluded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.",
