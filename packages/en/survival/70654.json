At\r\nsuch places the fishermen will tell you of black peaty earth,\r\nwith hazel-nuts, and often with tree-stumps still rooted in the\r\nsoil, seen between tide-marks when the overlying sea-sand has been\r\ncleared away by some storm or unusually persistent wind. If one is\r\nfortunate enough to be on the spot when such a patch is uncovered\r\nthis “submerged forest” is found to extend right down to the level\r\nof the lowest tides. The trees are often well-grown oaks, though\r\nmore commonly they turn out to be merely brushwood of hazel, sallow,\r\nand alder, mingled with other swamp-plants, such as the rhizomes of\r\n_Osmunda_.\r\n\r\nThese submerged forests or “Noah’s Woods” as they are called locally,\r\nhave attracted attention from early times, all the more so owing to\r\nthe existence of an uneasy feeling that, though like most other\r\ngeological phenomena they were popularly explained by Noah’s deluge,\r\nit was difficult thus to account for trees rooted in their original\r\nsoil, and yet now found well below the level of high tide.\r\n\r\nIt may be thought that these flats of black peaty soil though curious\r\nhave no particular bearing on scientific questions. They show that\r\ncertain plants and trees then lived in this country, as they do now;\r\nand that certain animals now extinct in Britain once flourished here,\r\nfor bones and teeth of wild-boar, wolf, bear, and beaver are often\r\nfound. Beyond this, however, the submerged forests seem to be of\r\nlittle interest. They are particularly dirty to handle or walk upon;\r\nso that the archaeologist is inclined to say that they belong to the\r\nprovince of geology, and the geologist remarks that they are too\r\nmodern to be worth his attention; and both pass on.\r\n\r\nShould we conquer our natural repugnance for such soft and messy\r\ndeposits, and examine more closely into these submerged forests,\r\nthey turn out to be full of interest. It is largely their extremely\r\ninconvenient position, always either wet or submerged, that has\r\nmade them so little studied. It is necessary to get at things more\r\nsatisfactorily than can be done by kneeling down on a wet muddy\r\nforeshore, with the feeling that one may be caught at any time by the\r\nadvancing tide, if the study is allowed to become too engrossing. But\r\nbefore leaving for a time the old land-surface exposed between tide\r\nmarks, it will be well to note that we have already gained one piece\r\nof valuable information from this hasty traverse. We have learnt that\r\nthe relative level of land and sea has changed somewhat, even since\r\nthis geologically modern deposit was formed.\r\n\r\nGeologists, however, sometimes speak of the submerged forests\r\nas owing their present position to various accidental causes.\r\nLandslips, compression of the underlying strata, or the removal of\r\nsome protecting shingle-beach or chain of sand-dunes are all called\r\ninto play, in order to avoid the conclusion that the sea-level\r\nhas in truth changed so recently. The causes above mentioned have\r\nundoubtedly all of them affected certain localities, and it behoves\r\nus to be extremely careful not to be misled. Landslips cannot happen\r\nwithout causing some disturbance, and a careful examination commonly\r\nshows no sign of disturbance, the roots descending unbroken into\r\nthe rock below. It is also evident in most cases that no landslip\r\nis possible, for the “forest” occupies a large area and lies nearly\r\nlevel.\r\n\r\nCompression of the underlying strata, and consequent sinking of the\r\nland-surface above, is however a more difficult matter to deal with.\r\nSuch compression undoubtedly takes place, and some of the appearances\r\nof subsidence since the Roman invasion are really cases of this sort.\r\nWhere the trees of the submerged forest can be seen rooted into\r\nhard rock, or into firm undisturbed strata of ancient date, there\r\ncan, however, be no question that their position below sea-level is\r\ndue to subsidence of the land or to a rise of the sea, and not to\r\ncompression. But in certain cases it is found that our submerged\r\nland-surface rests on a considerable thickness of soft alluvial\r\nstrata, consisting of alternate beds of silt and vegetable matter.\r\nHere it is perfectly obvious that in course of time the vegetable\r\nmatter will decay, and the silt will pack more closely, thus causing\r\nthe land-surface above slowly to sink. Subsidence of this character\r\nis well known in the Fenland and in Holland, and we must be careful\r\nnot to be misled by it into thinking that a change of sea-level has\r\nhappened within the last few centuries. The sinking of the Fenland\r\ndue to this cause amounts to several feet.\r\n\r\nThe third cause of uncertainty above mentioned, destruction of some\r\nbank which formerly protected the forest, needs a few words. It is\r\na real difficulty in some cases, and is very liable to mislead the\r\narchaeologist. We shall see, however, that it can apply only to a\r\nvery limited range of level.\r\n\r\nExtensive areas of marsh or meadow, protected by a high shingle-beach\r\nor chain of sand-dunes, are not uncommon, especially along our\r\neastern coast. These marshes may be quite fresh, and even have trees\r\ngrowing on them, below the level of high tide, as long as the\r\nbarrier remains unbroken. The reason of this is obvious. The rise\r\nand fall of the tide allows sea water to percolate landward and the\r\nfresh water to percolate seaward; but the friction is so great as to\r\nobliterate most of the tidal wave. Thus the sea at high tide is kept\r\nout, the fresh water behind the barrier remaining at a level slightly\r\nabove that of mean tide, and just above that level we may find a wet\r\nsoil on which trees can grow. But, and here is the important point, a\r\nprotected land-surface behind such a barrier can never lie below the\r\nlevel of mean tide; if it sinks below that level it must immediately\r\nbe flooded, either by fresh water or by sea water. This rule\r\napplies everywhere, except to countries where evaporation exceeds\r\nprecipitation; only in such countries, Palestine for instance, can\r\none find sunk or Dead Sea depressions below mean-tide level of the\r\nopen sea.\r\n\r\nThe submerged forest that we have already examined stretched far\r\nbelow the level of mean tide, in fact we followed it down to the\r\nlevel of the lowest spring tides. Nothing but a change of sea-level\r\nwill account for its present position. In short, the three objections\r\nabove referred to, while teaching us to be careful to examine the\r\nevidence in doubtful cases, cannot be accepted as any explanation\r\nof the constant and widespread occurrence of ancient land-surfaces\r\npassing beneath the sea.\r\n\r\nWe have thus traced the submerged forest down to low-water mark, and\r\nhave seen it pass out of our reach below the sea. We naturally ask\r\nnext, what happens at still lower levels? It is usually difficult\r\nto examine deposits below the sea-level; but fortunately most of\r\nour docks are excavated just in such places as those in which the\r\nsubmerged forests are likely to occur. Docks are usually placed in\r\nthe wide, open, estuaries, and it is often necessary nowadays to\r\ncarry the excavations fully fifty feet below the marsh-level. Such\r\nexcavations should be carefully watched, for they throw a flood of\r\nlight on the deposits we wish to examine.\r\n\r\nEvery dock excavation, however, does not necessarily cut through\r\nthe submerged forests, for channels in an estuary are constantly\r\nshifting, and many of our docks happen to be so placed as to coincide\r\nwith comparatively modern silted-up channels. Thus at King’s Lynn\r\nthey hit on an old and forgotten channel of the Ouse, and the bottom\r\nof the dock showed a layer of ancient shoes, mediaeval pottery, and\r\nsuch-like—interesting to the archaeologist, but not what we are now\r\nin search of. At Devonport also the recent dock extension coincided\r\nwith a modern silted-up channel. In various other cases, however, the\r\nexcavations have cut through a most curious alternation of deposits,\r\nthough the details vary from place to place.\r\n\r\nThe diagram (fig. 1) shows roughly what is found. We will suppose\r\nthat the docks are placed, as is usually the case, on the salt\r\nmarshes, but with their landward edge reaching the more solid rising\r\nground, on which the warehouses, etc., are to be built. Beginning at\r\nor just above the level of ordinary high-water of spring tides, the\r\nfirst deposit to be cut through is commonly a bed (_A_) of estuarine\r\nsilt or warp with remains of cockles, _Scrobicularia_, and salt-marsh\r\nvegetation. Mingled with these we find drifted wreckage, sunk boats,\r\nand miscellaneous rubbish, all belonging to the historic period.\r\nThe deposits suggest no change of sea-level, and are merely the\r\naccumulated mud which has gradually blocked and silted up great part\r\nof our estuaries and harbours during the last 3500 years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.]\r\n\r\nThis estuarine silt may continue downward to a level below mean tide,\r\nor perhaps even to low-water level; but if the sequence is complete\r\nwe notice below it a sudden change to a black peaty soil (_B_),\r\nfull of vegetable matter, showing sallows, alder, and hazel rooted\r\nin their position of growth. In this soil we may also find seams of\r\nshell-marl, or chara-marl, such as would form in shallow pools or\r\nchannels in a freshwater marsh. This black peaty soil is obviously\r\nthe same “submerged forest” that we have already examined on the\r\nforeshore at the mouth of the estuary; the only difference being that\r\nin the more exposed situation the waves of the sea have cleared away\r\nthe overlying silt, thus laying bare the land surface beneath. In\r\nthe dock excavations, therefore, the submerged forest can be seen in\r\nsection and examined at leisure.\r\n\r\nThe next deposit (_C_), lying beneath the submerged forest, is\r\ncommonly another bed of estuarine silt, extending to a depth of\r\nseveral feet and carrying our observations well below the level of\r\nlow-water. Then comes a second land-surface (_D_), perhaps with trees\r\ndiffering from those of the one above; or it may be a thick layer of\r\nmarsh peat. More silt (_E_) follows; another submerged forest (_F_);\r\nthen more estuarine deposits (_G_); and finally at the base of the\r\nchannel, fully 50 feet below the level of high-water, we may find\r\nstools of oak (_H_) still rooted in the undisturbed rock below.\r\n\r\nAs each of these deposits commonly extends continuously across the\r\ndock, except where it happens to abut against the rising ground, it\r\nis obvious that it is absolutely cut off from each of the others.\r\nThe lowest land-surface is covered by laminated silts, and that\r\nagain is sealed up by the matted vegetation of the next growth. Thus\r\nnothing can work its way down from layer to layer, unless it be a\r\npile forcibly driven down by repeated blows. Materials from the older\r\ndeposits in other parts of the estuary may occasionally be scoured\r\nout and re-deposited in a newer layer; but no object of a later\r\nperiod will find its way into older beds.\r\n\r\nThus we have in these strongly marked alternations of peat and warp\r\nan ideal series of deposits for the study of successive stages.\r\nIn them the geologist should be able to study ancient changes of\r\nsea-level, under such favourable conditions as to leave no doubt\r\nas to the reality and exact amount of these changes. The antiquary\r\nshould find the remains of ancient races of man, sealed up with his\r\nweapons and tools. Here he will be troubled by no complications\r\nfrom rifled tombs, burials in older graves, false inscriptions, or\r\naccidental mixture. He ought here to find also implements of wood,\r\nbasket-work, or objects in leather, such as are so rarely preserved\r\nin deposits above the water-level, except in a very dry country.\r\n\r\nTo the zoologist and botanist the study of each successive layer\r\nshould yield evidence of the gradual changes and fluctuations in our\r\nfauna and flora, during early periods when man, except as hunter,\r\nhad little influence on the face of nature. If I can persuade\r\nobservers to pay more attention to these modern deposits my object is\r\nsecured, and we shall soon know more about some very obscure branches\r\nof geology and archaeology.\r\n\r\nI do not wish to imply that excellent work has not already been done\r\nin the examination of these deposits. Much has been done; but it\r\nhas usually been done unsystematically, or else from the point of\r\nview of the geologist alone. What is wanted is something more than\r\nthis—the deposits should be examined bed by bed, and nothing should\r\nbe overlooked, whether it belong to geology, archaeology, or natural\r\nhistory. We desire to know not merely what was the sea-level at each\r\nsuccessive stage, but what were the climatic conditions. We must\r\nenquire also what the fauna and flora were like, what race of man\r\nthen inhabited the country, how he lived, what weapons and boats he\r\nused, and how he and all these animals and plants were able to cross\r\nto this country after the passing away of the cold of the Glacial\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nTo certain of the above questions we can already make some answer;\r\nbut before dealing with conclusions, it will be advisable to give\r\nsome account of the submerged land-surfaces known in various parts of\r\nBritain. This we will do in the next chapters.\r\n\r\nBefore going further it will be well to explain and limit more\r\ndefinitely the field of our present enquiry. It may be said that\r\nthere are “submerged forests” of various geological dates, and this\r\nis perfectly true. The “dirt-bed” of the Isle of Purbeck, with its\r\nupright cycad-stems, was at one time a true submerged forest, for\r\nit is overlain by various marine strata, and during the succeeding\r\nCretaceous period it was probably submerged thousands of feet. Every\r\ncoal seam with its underlying soil or “underclay” penetrated by\r\nstigmarian roots was also once a submerged forest. Usage, however,\r\nlimits the term to the more recent strata of this nature, and to\r\nthese we will for the present confine our attention. We do not\r\nundertake a description of the earlier Cromer Forest-bed, or even of\r\nthe Pleistocene submerged forests containing bones of elephant and\r\nrhinoceros and shells of _Corbicula fluminalis_. These deposits will,\r\nhowever, be referred to where from their position they are liable to\r\nbe confounded with others of later date.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE THAMES VALLEY\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the last chapter an attempt was made to give a general idea of\r\nthe nature of the deposits; we will now give actual examples of what\r\nhas been seen. Unfortunately we cannot say “what can be seen,” for\r\nthe lower submerged forests are only visible in dock excavations.\r\nAs these works are carried well below the sea-level and have to\r\nbe kept dry by pumping, it is impossible for them to remain open\r\nlong, and though new excavations are constantly being made, the old\r\nones are nearly always hidden within a few weeks of their becoming\r\nvisible. Of course these remarks do not apply to the highest of\r\nthese submerged land-surfaces, which can be examined again and again\r\nbetween tide-marks, whenever the tide is favourable and the sand of\r\nthe foreshore has been swept away.\r\n\r\nThe most convenient way of dealing with the evidence will perhaps be\r\nto describe first what has been seen in the estuary of the Thames.\r\nThen in later chapters we will take the localities on our east coast\r\nand connected with the North Sea basin. Next we will speak of those\r\non the Irish Sea and English Channel. Lastly, the numerous exposures\r\non the west or Atlantic coast will require notice, and with them may\r\nbe taken the corresponding deposits on the French coast. Each of\r\nthese groups will require a separate chapter.\r\n\r\nThe Thames near London forms a convenient starting point, for the\r\nnumerous dock-excavations, tunnels, deep drains and dredgings have\r\nlaid open the structure of this valley and its deposits in an\r\nexceptionally complete way. The published accounts of the excavations\r\nin the Thames Valley are so voluminous that it is impossible here to\r\ndeal with them in any detail; we must therefore confine ourselves\r\nto those which best illustrate the points we have in view, choosing\r\nmodern excavations which have been carefully watched, noted, and\r\ncollected from rather than ancient ones.\r\n\r\nWe cannot do better than take as an illustration of the mode of\r\noccurrence and levels of the submerged land-surfaces the section\r\nseen in the excavation of Tilbury Docks, for this was most carefully\r\nnoted by the engineers, and was visited by two competent observers,\r\nMessrs. W. Whitaker and F. C. J. Spurrell. This excavation is of\r\ngreat scientific importance, for it led to the discovery of a human\r\nskeleton beneath three distinct layers of submerged peat, and these\r\nremains have been most carefully studied by Owen and Huxley, and more\r\nrecently by Professor Keith.\r\n\r\nThe section communicated to Sir Richard Owen by Mr Donald Baynes, the\r\nengineer superintending the excavation at the time of the discovery,\r\nis shown in the diagram on p. 14.

Section at Tilbury Docks.] layers made by Mr Spurrell, for\r\nthough his specimens did not come from exactly this part of the\r\ndocks, the various beds are traceable over so large an area that\r\nthere is no doubt as to their continuity.\r\n\r\nOwen thought that this skeleton belonged to a man of the Palaeolithic\r\nperiod, considering it contemporaneous with the mammoth and\r\nrhinoceros found elsewhere in the neighbourhood. Other geological\r\nwriters showed however that these deposits were much more modern,\r\nand some of them spoke somewhat contemptuously of their extremely\r\nrecent date. But Huxley saw the importance of this “river-drift\r\nman” as an ancient and peculiar race, and Professor Keith has more\r\nrecently drawn especial attention to the well-marked characteristics\r\nof the type. The skeleton is not of Palaeolithic date, but neither is\r\nit truly modern; other examples have turned up in similar deposits\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nWe will now describe more fully the successive layers met with in\r\nTilbury Docks, condensing the account from that given by Messrs.\r\nSpurrell and Whitaker, and using where possible the numbers attached\r\nby the engineer to the successive beds.\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that the marsh-level lies several feet below\r\nTrinity high water. Below the sod of the marsh came a bed of fine\r\ngrey tidal clay (1), in which at a depth of seven feet below\r\nthe surface Mr Spurrell noted, in one part of the docks, an old\r\ngrass-grown surface strewn with Roman refuse, such as tiles,\r\npottery, and oyster shells. This fixes the date of the layer above as\r\npost-Roman; but the low position of the Roman land-surface, now at\r\nabout mean-tide level, is due in great part to shrinkage since the\r\nmarsh was embanked and drained—it is unconnected with any general\r\npost-Roman subsidence of the land.\r\n\r\nBeneath the Roman layer occurs more marsh-clay and silt (2), resting\r\non a thin peat (4) which according to Mr Whitaker is sometimes\r\nabsent. Then follows another bed of marsh-clay (5), shown by the\r\nengineer as four feet thick, but which in places thickens to six\r\nor seven feet. Below this is a thick mass (6) of reedy peat (the\r\n“main peat” of Mr Spurrell), which is described as consisting mainly\r\nof _Phragmites_ and _Sparganium_, with layers of moss and fronds\r\nof fern. The other plants observed in this peat were the elder,\r\nwhite-birch, alder and oak. Associated with them were found several\r\nspecies of freshwater snails and a few land forms; but the only\r\nanimal or plant showing any trace of the influence of salt water was\r\n_Hydrobia ventrosa_, a shell that requires slightly brackish water.\r\n\r\nThe main peat rests on another bed of estuarine silt (7 and 8), which\r\nseems to vary considerably in thickness, from 5 to 12 feet. It is\r\nnot quite clear from the descriptions whether the “thin woody peat”\r\nof Mr Whitaker and the “sand with decayed wood” (9) of the engineer\r\nrepresent a true growth in place, like the main peat; it is somewhat\r\nirregular and tends to abut against banks of sand (9*) rising from\r\nbelow. In one of these banks, according to Mr Spurrell, the human\r\nskeleton was found.\r\n\r\nThe contents of the sand (other than the skeleton) included\r\n_Bythinia_ and _Succinea_; and as Mr Spurrell calls it a “river\r\ndeposit,” it apparently did not yield estuarine shells, like the\r\nsilts above. The sub-angular flint gravel (10) below has all the\r\nappearance of a river gravel; it may be from 10 to 20 feet thick, and\r\nrests on chalk only reached in borings.\r\n\r\nThe floor of chalk beneath these alluvial deposits lies about 60 or\r\n70 feet below the Ordnance datum in the neighbourhood of Tilbury and\r\nGravesend, and in the middle of the ancient channel of the Thames\r\nit may be 10 feet lower; but there is no evidence of a greater\r\ndepth than this. We may take it therefore that here the Thames once\r\ncut a channel about 60 feet below its modern bed. We cannot say,\r\nhowever, from this evidence alone that the sea-level then was only 60\r\nfeet below Ordnance datum, for it is obvious that it may have been\r\nconsiderably lower. If, as we believe, the southern part of the North\r\nSea was then a wide marsh, the Thames may have followed a winding\r\ncourse of many miles before reaching the sea, then probably far away,\r\nin the latitude of the Dogger Bank. This must be borne in mind: we\r\nknow the minimum extent of the change of level; but its full amount\r\nhas to be ascertained from other localities.\r\n\r\nThis difficulty has seemed of far greater importance than it really\r\nis, and some geologists have suggested that at this period of maximum\r\nelevation, England stood several hundred feet higher above the sea\r\nthan it does now. I doubt if such can have been the case. Granting\r\nthat the sea may have been some 300 miles away from Tilbury, measured\r\nalong the course of the winding river, this 300 miles would need a\r\nvery small fall per mile, probably not more than an inch or two. The\r\nThames was rapidly growing in volume, from the access of tributaries,\r\nand was therefore flowing in a deeper and wider channel, which was\r\ncut through soft alluvial strata; it therefore required less and less\r\nfall per mile. Long before it reached the Dogger it probably flowed\r\ninto the Rhine, then containing an enormous volume of water and\r\ndraining twice its present catchment area.\r\n\r\nThe clean gravel and sand which occupy the lower part of the ancient\r\nchannel at Tilbury require to be more closely examined, for it is\r\nnot clear that they are, as supposed, of fluviatile origin; they may\r\nquite well be estuarine. In the sand Mr Spurrell found the freshwater\r\nshells _Bythinia_ and _Succinea_, and in it was also found the\r\nhuman skeleton described by Owen; but, according to Mr Spurrell, on\r\nthe surface of this sand lay a few stray valves of the estuarine\r\n_Scrobicularia_ and of _Tellina_. The bottom deposits were probably\r\nlaid down in a tidal river; but whether within the influence of the\r\nsalt water is doubtful.\r\n\r\nAs far as the Tilbury evidence goes it suggests a maximum elevation\r\nof the land of about 80 feet above its present level; but we will\r\nreturn to this question when we have dealt with the other rivers\r\nflowing more directly into deep sea. The animals and plants found at\r\nTilbury were all living species.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary here to discuss more fully the submerged forests\r\nseen in dock and other excavations in the Thames flats, for they\r\noccupy a good many pages in the _Geology of London_ published by the\r\nGeological Survey. Even 250 years ago, the hazel trees were noticed\r\nby the inquisitive Pepys during one of his official visits to the\r\ndockyards, and later writers are full of remarks on the ancient yew\r\ntrees and oaks found well below the sea-level. Most of these early\r\naccounts are, however, of little scientific value.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE EAST COAST\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not our purpose to describe in detail the many exposures of\r\nsubmerged land-surfaces which have been seen on the shores of the\r\nNorth Sea. This would serve no useful purpose and would be merely\r\ntedious. We need only say that the floor of Eocene or Cretaceous\r\nstrata on which these ancient subaerial deposits rest is constantly\r\nfound at depths of 50 or 60 feet below the level of the existing\r\nsalt-marsh. But where, as in the estuary of the Thames and Humber, an\r\nolder channel underlies a modern channel, the floor sinks about 30\r\nfeet lower. From present marsh-level to ancient marsh-level is about\r\n60 feet; from present river-bottom to old river-bottom is also about\r\n60 feet. This, therefore, is the extent of the former elevation,\r\nunless we can prove that the sea was then so far away that the river\r\nonce had many miles to flow before reaching it. This is the point we\r\nhave now to consider as we trace the submerged forests northward and\r\ntowards the deeper seas.\r\n\r\nBefore we leave the southern part of the North Sea basin it will be\r\nwell to draw attention to a few of the half-tide exposures which for\r\none reason or another may tend to mislead the observer. The mere\r\noccurrence of roots below tide marks is not sufficient to prove that\r\nthe land-surfaces seen are all of one date.\r\n\r\nNot far from Tilbury is found the well-known geological hunting\r\nground of Grays, where the brick-yards have yielded numerous extinct\r\nmammalia and several land and freshwater shells now extinct in\r\nBritain. These deposits lie in an old channel of the Thames, cut to\r\nbelow mean-tide level, but here not coinciding exactly in position\r\neither with the channel of the existing river, or with the channel in\r\nwhich the submerged forests lie.\r\n\r\nIt is fortunate that the channels do not coincide, for this enables\r\nus to distinguish the more ancient deposits. A glance at a geological\r\nmap shows, however, that they must coincide elsewhere, and where\r\nthe Thames has re-occupied its old channel it is clear that the\r\ndestruction of the earlier deposits may have led to a mixture of\r\nfossils and implements belonging to three different dates. Mammoth\r\nteeth and Palaeolithic implements, Irish elk and polished stone\r\nimplements, may all be dredged up in the modern river gravel,\r\nassociated with bits of iron chain, old shoes, and pottery. Such\r\na mixture does actually occur in the Thames estuary, and it makes\r\nus hesitate to accept the teeth of mammoth which were dredged in\r\nthe Thames as really belonging to so late a period as that of the\r\nsubmerged forests.\r\n\r\nAt Clacton a similar difficulty is met with, for there again an\r\nancient channel contains alternating estuarine and freshwater\r\ndeposits with layers of peat, and is full of bones belonging to\r\nrhinoceros, hippopotamus, elephant and other extinct mammalia. Of\r\ncourse the peat-beds in this channel are just as much entitled to\r\nthe name “submerged forest” as the more modern deposits to which\r\nrecent usage restricts it. They belong, however, to another and more\r\nancient chapter of the geological record than that with which we are\r\nnow dealing. I do not say a less interesting one, for they are of the\r\ngreatest importance when we study the times when Palaeolithic man\r\nflourished; but at present we have as much as we can do to understand\r\nthe later deposits and to realize the great changes to which they\r\npoint. We must not turn aside for everything of interest that we come\r\nacross in this study; these earlier strata are worthy of a book to\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nAs we travel northward along the coast, again and again we meet with\r\nevidence of a submerged nearly level platform, “basal plane,” or\r\nancient “plane of marine denudation,” lying about 50 feet below the\r\nsea. We find it at Langer Fort, which lies opposite to Harwich on a\r\nspit of sand and shingle stretching across Harwich Harbour. Here the\r\nfloor of London Clay was met with in a boring at 54 feet below the\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nThe Suffolk coast north of Southwold yields yet another complication,\r\nfor between Southwold and Sherringham in Norfolk there appears at\r\nthe sea-level a land-surface considerably more ancient than anything\r\nwe have yet been dealing with. This is the so-called “Cromer\r\nForest-bed,” which consists of alternating freshwater and estuarine\r\nbeds, with ancient land-surfaces and masses of peat. It contains\r\nnumerous extinct mammals, mainly of species older than and different\r\nfrom those of Clacton and Grays.\r\n\r\nThe mammalian remains differentiate these deposits at once; but if\r\nno determinable mammals are found, the crushing of the bones and\r\nthe greater compression and alteration of the peaty beds serves to\r\ndistinguish them, for this Forest-bed dates back to Pliocene times,\r\npasses under a considerable thickness of glacial beds, and has been\r\nover-ridden by the ice-sheet during the Glacial epoch.\r\n\r\nThe Cromer Forest-bed has been exposed particularly well of late\r\nyears at Kessingland, near Lowestoft, where the sea has encroached\r\ngreatly. It is well worth while to make a comparative study of this\r\ndeposit, of the Grays and Clacton _Cyrena_-bed, of the submerged\r\nforests of the Thames docks, and of the strata now being formed in\r\nand around the Norfolk Broads. By such a comparison we can trace the\r\neffects of similar conditions occurring again and again. The fauna\r\nand flora slowly change, species come and go, man appears and races\r\nchange: though the same physical conditions may recur life ever\r\nchanges.\r\n\r\nThe Norfolk Broads, just referred to, deserve study from another\r\npoint of view: their origin is directly connected with the\r\nsubmergence which forms the theme of this book. These broads are\r\nshallow lakes, always occupying part of the widest alluvial flats\r\nwhich border the rivers; but they are usually out of the direct\r\ncourse of the present river; they therefore receive little of the\r\nsediment brought down in flood-time. On the other hand they are\r\nsteadily being filled up with growing vegetation and turned into peat\r\nmosses.\r\n\r\nThe origin of these shallow freshwater lakes, which form a\r\ncharacteristic feature in the scenery of East Anglia, has been\r\nmuch debated; but with the knowledge obtained from a study of the\r\nsubmerged forests the explanation is perfectly simple. During this\r\nperiod of slow submergence each of the shallow valleys in which the\r\nbroads now lie was turned into a wide and deep navigable estuary,\r\nwhich extended inland for many miles. When the subsidence stopped the\r\nsea and tides soon formed bars and sand-banks at the mouths of the\r\nestuaries, and lateral tributaries pushed their deltas across. The\r\nNorfolk rivers, being small and sluggish, were driven to one side,\r\nand could neither cut away the sand-banks nor fill up with sediment\r\nsuch wide expanses. These estuaries therefore were silted up with\r\ntidal mud and turned into irregular chains of lakes, separated by\r\nirregular bars and sand-banks. The lakes, instead of becoming rapidly\r\nobliterated and filled up by deltas which crept gradually seaward,\r\nremained as freshwater broads; for as soon as a bank became high\r\nenough for the growth of reeds and sedges the river mud was strained\r\nout and only nearly clean water reached the lagoon behind. Thus a\r\ndepression once left, provided it was out of the direct course of the\r\nriver, tended to remain as a freshwater lake until vegetable growth\r\ncould fill it, and the river mud was spread out over the salt-marshes\r\nor went to raise the sand-banks till they became alluvial flats, and\r\nthus still more thoroughly isolated the broad.\r\n\r\nA few centuries will see the disappearance of the last of the broads,\r\nwhich have silted up to an enormous extent within historic times;\r\nbut the fact that so many of these broads still exist may be taken\r\nas clear evidence of the recent date of the depression which led to\r\ntheir formation.\r\n\r\nWhen we look at ancient records, and notice the rapidity with which\r\nthe broads and navigable estuaries are becoming obliterated, we\r\ncannot help wondering whether the measure of this silting up may not\r\ngive us the date of the last change of sea-level. It should do so\r\nif we could obtain accurate measurements of the amount of sediment\r\ndeposited annually, of the rate at which the sea is now washing\r\nit in, and of the rate at which the rivers are bringing it down.\r\nAll these factors, however, are uncertain, and it is particularly\r\ndifficult to ascertain the part played by the muddy tidal stream\r\nwhich flows in after storms and spreads far and wide over the marsh.\r\n\r\nThough all the factors are so uncertain, we can form some idea of\r\nthe date of the submergence. Many years ago I made a series of\r\ncalculations, founded on the silting up of our east coast estuaries,\r\nthe growth of the shingle-spits, and the accumulation of sand-dunes.\r\nThe results were only roughly concordant, but they seemed to show\r\nthat the subsidence stopped about 2500 years ago and was probably\r\nstill in progress at a date 500 years earlier. This question of dates\r\nwill be again referred to in a later chapter.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the Broad district we must refer to a boring made at\r\nYarmouth, which, according to Prof. Prestwich, showed that the recent\r\nestuarine deposits are there 120 feet thick, and consequently that\r\nthe ancient valley was far deeper than any recorded in the foregoing\r\npages. There is no doubt, however, that this interpretation is\r\nfounded on a mistake, for other borings at Yarmouth, Lowestoft, and\r\nBeccles came to muddy sands and clays belonging to the upper part of\r\nthe Crag, now known to thicken greatly eastward. The recent deposits\r\ndescend only to a depth of about 50 feet at Yarmouth, and consist\r\nof sand and shingle; the beds below contain Pliocene mollusca. This\r\nemendation is also borne out by the entirely different character\r\nof the recent estuarine deposits at Potter Heigham, where we again\r\nfind a submerged forest at about 56 feet below the marsh-level. The\r\nsection recorded by Mr Blake is as follows:—\r\n\r\n                                                 feet\r\n  Bluish-grey loam                                 24\r\n  Grey silty sand                              ½ to 2\r\n  Stiff bluish-grey loam, clay, and silt\r\n    full of cockles, &c.                           13\r\n  Black peat, hard, and much compressed            17\r\n  White and buff sand                               2\r\n                                                   —-\r\n                                                   58\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that here only one peat bed was found, and was at\r\nthe usual depth of the lowest submerged forest. Possibly the white\r\nsand below was the bleached top of the Crag; but this point was not\r\ncleared up.\r\n\r\nIf we resume our journey northward along the Norfolk coast we come\r\nto the well-known locality of Eccles, where the old church tower\r\ndescribed and figured by Lyell in his _Principles of Geology_ long\r\nstood on the foreshore, washed by every spring tide. The position of\r\nthis church formed a striking illustration of the protection afforded\r\nby a chain of sand-dunes. The church was originally built on the\r\nmarshes inside these dunes, at a level just below that of high-water\r\nspring tides. But as the dunes were driven inland they gradually\r\noverwhelmed the church, till only the top of its tower appeared above\r\nthe sand. In this state it was pictured by Lyell in the year 1839.\r\nLater on (in 1862) it was again sketched by the Rev. S. W. King, and\r\nstood on the seaward side of the dune and almost free from sand. For\r\na series of years, from 1877 onward, I watched the advance of the\r\nsea, and as the church tower was more and more often reached by the\r\ntides, its foundations were laid bare and attacked by the waves, till\r\nat last the tower fell.\r\n\r\nNot only were the foundations of Eccles church exposed on the\r\nforeshore, but an old road across the marshes also appeared on\r\nthe seaward side of the dunes, giving a still more exact idea of\r\nthe former great influence of the chain of dunes in damping the\r\noscillations of the tidal wave. The tide outside now rises and falls\r\nsome 12 or 15 feet; on the marsh within its influence is only felt\r\nunder exceptional circumstances. A road across the marsh at a level\r\nfour or five feet below high-water, as this one stood, would still be\r\npassable, except during unusual floods.\r\n\r\nEccles Church is an excellent example of the way in which an ancient\r\nland-surface may now be found below the level of high-water, and yet\r\nno subsidence of the land has taken place. But this coast can give\r\neven more curious examples. It does not need a sand-dune to deaden\r\nthe rise and fall of the tides; even a submerged bank will have much\r\nthe same effect. Extensive submerged sand-banks extend parallel with\r\nthe coast, protecting the anchorage known as Yarmouth Roads. These\r\nbanks rise so nearly to the surface of the sea that not only do they\r\nprotect the town and anchorage against the waves, they deaden the\r\ntidal oscillation to such an extent that its range is much greater\r\noutside the bank than within.\r\n\r\nIf these submerged outer banks were to be swept away by some change\r\nin the set of the currents, large areas now cultivated and inhabited\r\nwould be flooded by salt water at every spring tide, and the turf\r\nof the meadows would be covered by a layer of marine silt, such\r\nas we see alternating with the submerged forests in the docks of\r\nthe Thames. Such alternations, if thin, do not necessarily prove a\r\nchange in the level of the sea; they may only point to the alternate\r\naccumulation and removal of sand-banks in a distant part of the\r\nestuary.\r\n\r\nThe Norfolk coast trends westward soon after leaving Cromer, and\r\nwhere the cliff seems to pass inland at Weybourn we enter an ancient\r\nvalley, one side of which has been entirely cut away by the sea,\r\nexcept for a few relics of the further bank, now included in the\r\nshingle beach which runs out to sea nearly parallel with the coast\r\nand protects Blakeney Harbour. Here again we find that in the bottom\r\nof the valley there must be a submerged forest, for slabs of peat are\r\noften thrown up at Weybourn, and by the use of a grapnel the peat was\r\nfound in place off Weybourn at a depth of several fathoms.\r\n\r\nWhen the coast turns southward again, and the wide bay of the Wash is\r\nentered, we find an extensive development of submerged land-surfaces\r\nand peat beds, extending over great part of the Fenland. In fact the\r\nwhole Fenland and Wash was once a slightly undulating plain, cut into\r\nby numerous shallow open valleys. The effect of the submergence of\r\nthis area has been to cause the greater part of it to silt up to a\r\nuniform level, through the accumulation of warp and growth of peat;\r\nso that now the Fenland has become a dead level, out of which a few\r\nlow hills rise abruptly. The islands of the Fenland, such as those on\r\nwhich Ely and March are built, are merely almost submerged hill-tops;\r\nthey were not isolated by marine action.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that a wide sheltered bay of this sort forms an ideal\r\narea in which to study the gradual filling up and obliteration of the\r\nvalleys, as the land sank; and it may enable us to learn the maximum\r\namount of the change of sea-level. The Fenland unfortunately does\r\nnot contain very deep dock excavations, and we have only various\r\nshallower engineering works to depend on, though numerous borings\r\nreach the old floor.\r\n\r\nA preliminary difficulty, however, meets us in the study of the Fen\r\ndeposits; it is the same difficulty that we have already referred\r\nto when describing Clacton and Grays, and we shall meet with it\r\nagain. In certain parts of the Fenland, particularly about March and\r\nChatteris, a sheet of shoal-water marine gravelly sand caps some of\r\nthe low hills, which rise a few feet above the fen-level. The gravel\r\nfor long was taken to be the same bed that passes under the marshes.\r\nLater work showed however that these gravels, with their sub-arctic\r\nmarine fauna and containing also _Corbicula fluminalis_, were of\r\nmuch earlier date than the true fen-deposits. Just as we saw happen\r\nin the Thames Valley, a wide plain and estuary existed long before\r\nthe deeper channels containing the submerged forests were cut; and\r\nthe deposits of this older estuary and its tributaries are still to\r\nbe found in patches here and there. Sometimes, as at March, they cap\r\nhills a few feet above the fen-level; but as often they fill channels\r\nnot quite coinciding with the later channels; just as they do at\r\nGrays. Or two deposits of quite different date may lie side by side,\r\nas they do in the Nar Valley, or at Clacton, or on the Sussex coast.\r\n\r\nThe true fen-deposits were carefully examined by Messrs. Marshall,\r\nFisher, and Skertchly, as far as the shallow sections would allow,\r\nand the following account is mainly condensed from that given by Mr\r\nSkertchly in his _Geology of the Fenland_.\r\n\r\nDuring the excavation of certain deep dykes for the purpose of\r\ndraining the fens there was discovered at a depth of about 10 feet\r\nbelow the surface a forest of oaks, with their roots imbedded in the\r\nunderlying Kimmeridge Clay. The trunks were broken off at a height of\r\nabout three feet. Some of the fallen trees were of fine proportion,\r\nmeasuring three feet in diameter, quite straight and seldom forked.\r\nAt an average height of two feet above this “forest No. 1” the\r\nremains of another were found (in the peat) consisting of oaks and\r\nyews. Three feet above “forest No. 2” lay the remains of another, in\r\nwhich the trees are all Scotch firs, some of which were three feet in\r\ndiameter. Above this and near to the surface was seen a still newer\r\nforest of small firs. The peat close to the surface contains remains\r\nof sallow and alder, and was formed with the sea at its present level.\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that the greatest depth at which these rooted\r\ntrees were found was only about ten feet below the sea-level. At\r\nthis high level we must expect to find that the growth of the peat\r\nwas practically continuous, and that the different submerged forests\r\nrun together. In adjoining depressions the different forests would\r\noccur at lower levels and would be separated by beds of marine silt.\r\nIt does not follow from the position that a low-level submerged\r\nland-surface is older than one at a higher elevation, for above the\r\npresent sea-level all these stages are represented by a few inches\r\nof soil, on which forest after forest has grown and decayed. Anyone\r\nwho has collected antiquities on fields knows what a curious jumble\r\nof Palaeolithic, Neolithic, bronze age, Roman, mediaeval and recent\r\nthings may be found mixed in these few inches of soil, or may be\r\nthrown up by an uprooted tree. The great advantage of studying the\r\ndeeply submerged forests is that in them the successive stages are\r\nseparated and isolated, instead of being mingled in so confusing a\r\nfashion.\r\n\r\nFor further information as to the more deeply submerged land-surfaces\r\nwe may turn to the numerous records of borings made in the Fenland\r\nand collected by the Geological Survey. These show that the thickness\r\nof the fen-deposits varies considerably from place to place, that\r\nthe floor below undulates and is by no means so flat as the surface\r\nof the fen above. Most of these borings, however, were not continued\r\nthrough the gravels which lie at the base of the deposit, and thus\r\nwe can only be certain of the total depth to the Jurassic clay or\r\nboulder clay in a few places. The maximum thickness of the fen-beds\r\nyet penetrated is less than 60 feet, and a submerged forest was found\r\nat Eaubrink at about 40 feet. It is possible however that none of\r\nthese scattered borings has happened to hit upon one of the buried\r\nriver-channels, which formerly wandered through this clayey lowland;\r\nif one were found it would probably show that the alluvial deposits\r\nare somewhat thicker than these measurements, and that they descend\r\nto a depth about equal to that reached in the valleys of the Thames\r\nor Humber.\r\n\r\nIt is useless to discuss in more detail the lower submerged forests\r\nof the Fenland, for we cannot get at them to examine them properly.\r\nThey have been as effectually overwhelmed and hidden as the remains\r\nof King John’s baggage train, which has never been seen again\r\nsince it wandered off the flooded causeway during the disastrous\r\nspring-tide of October 11, 1216, and sank into the soft clay and\r\nquicksands.\r\n\r\nThe higher submerged forests of the Fenland are however of great\r\ninterest, and as already pointed out they have been exposed to view\r\nin cutting the fen dykes, especially near Ely. Perhaps a closer\r\nstudy of these might enable us to arrive at some idea of the time\r\ntaken for the growth of a series of forests of this sort, and for\r\nthe accompanying mass of peat. The variations in the flora also\r\nneed more exact analysis before we can say what they betoken. The\r\noak-forest at the bottom is what we should expect on a clay soil; but\r\nthe reason for the succession of trees above is not obvious. It need\r\nnot necessarily point to climatic change, though it may do so; but\r\nit certainly looks as if the peaty bogs were alternately wetter and\r\ndrier, so that sometimes moss grew, and sometimes fir-trees. Neither\r\nneed this change imply an up-and-down movement of the land, though it\r\nmay be due to such a cause.\r\n\r\nSubsidence would destroy the oaks and allow a peat-moss to form;\r\nbut if the subsidence were intermittent the moss would increase in\r\nthickness, become more compact, and its surface rise, till it was\r\ndry enough for pines. Another subsidence would cause spongy peat\r\nagain to spread and kill the pine, and so on. Intermittent subsidence\r\nseems sufficient to account for all the changes of vegetation we have\r\nyet noticed in connexion with these submerged land-surfaces.\r\n\r\nOf the fauna of the fen-silts and peats it is very difficult to give\r\nany satisfactory account. If we put aside the March and Chatteris\r\nmarine gravels with _Corbicula fluminalis_, and the Nar Valley Clay\r\nwith its northern marine mollusca as being of older date; and if\r\nwe also reject the marginal gravels with hippopotamus and mammoth\r\nas being more ancient, there only remain a few mammals such as the\r\nbeaver, wolf, wild boar, and certain cetacea, which we can be sure\r\ncame out of the true fen-deposits. Implements made by man have only\r\nbeen found in the higher layers, and there seems to be no record in\r\nthis area of a stone implement found below a submerged forest.\r\n\r\nSubmerged forests of the ordinary type are often to be seen between\r\ntide-marks on the flat shores of Lincolnshire; but as they still\r\nawait proper study they need not here detain us, and we will pass on\r\nto the next large indentation of the coast-line, the estuary of the\r\nHumber.\r\n\r\nHere, owing to the excavation of extensive docks, and to a series of\r\ntrial borings for a tunnel beneath the Humber, the structure of the\r\nvalley has been clearly laid open. It is much the same as that of the\r\nThames; but as we are in a glaciated area we find, as in the Fenland,\r\nthat much of the erosion had taken place before or during the Glacial\r\nEpoch, for boulder clay occupies part of the valley.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.]\r\n\r\nBoulder clay or till not only occupies part of the valley, it\r\ndescends far below the present river bottom and even below the\r\nlowest submerged forest. This we find always to be the case in the\r\nglaciated parts of Britain; but whether the deep trenching is due\r\nto the ploughing out of a trough by a tongue of the ice-sheet,\r\nto sub-glacial streams below sea-level, or to erosion by a true\r\nsubaerial river is still a doubtful point. However, this question\r\nmust not detain us; we are not now dealing with elevations and\r\ndepressions of so ancient a date, and must confine our attention to\r\npost-glacial movements.\r\n\r\nThe section shown in fig. 3 will explain better than any words the\r\nstructure of the Humber Valley. It is drawn to scale from the\r\nengineer’s section, and shows at a glance the three channels. The\r\ndeepest and widest channel is that occupied by glacial deposits;\r\nan intermediate channel (shown in black) is occupied by silt and\r\nsubmerged forests; and a shallower channel is occupied by the present\r\nHumber and its alluvium. One interesting point, however, this section\r\ndoes not happen to illustrate. Somewhat lower down the Humber we\r\ncome to gravels and silts full of sub-arctic marine mollusca and\r\n_Corbicula fluminalis_, exactly as in regions further south, and\r\npresumably of the same age as the deposits we have already mentioned\r\nas found at March in the Fenland and at Grays in Essex. The exact\r\nrelation of these _Corbicula_-beds to the deep channel filled with\r\nglacial drift, below the marshes of the present Humber, is still\r\nsomewhat uncertain, but the marine beds clearly rest on boulder clay,\r\nand seem also to be overlain by another glacial deposit.\r\n\r\nThe section leaves no doubt that in post-glacial times the Humber\r\ncut a channel about 60 feet below its present bed, or to just the\r\nsame depth as did the Thames. This may possibly be an accidental\r\ncoincidence; but it is very suggestive that both these rivers should\r\nhave cut their beds to the same depth. Such coincidences suggest that\r\nwe are dealing with a period when each of our great rivers was able\r\nto cut to a definite base-level, below which it could not go. This\r\nbase-level must either have been the sea, or some vast alluvial plain\r\nthen occupying the bed of the North Sea. In either case the plain\r\nmust then have been fully 60 feet lower than the present sea-level.\r\nNot only did the ancient Humber cut to the same depth as the ancient\r\nThames, but in each area the ancient river was flanked by a wide\r\nalluvial flat which now lies from 40 to 60 feet below the modern\r\nmarsh level.\r\n\r\nThe flat coast of Holderness, which stretches from the Humber\r\nnorthward to Flamborough Head, shows also occasional submerged\r\nforests; but the want of excavations beneath the sea-level makes\r\nit impossible to say much about them. North of Flamborough Head it\r\nseems as though depression gave place to elevation, and when we\r\npass into Scotland the Neolithic deposits seem to be raised beaches\r\ninstead of submerged forests. We need not therefore devote more\r\ntime to a consideration of the details connected with the submerged\r\nland-surfaces which border the lands facing the North Sea. They\r\nevidently once formed part of a wide alluvial flat stretching seaward\r\nand running up all our larger valleys. We must now consider how far\r\nseaward this plain formerly extended.\r\n\r\nHere, fortunately, we meet with a most surprising piece of evidence,\r\nwhich adds enormously to the importance of this plain, and shows that\r\nthe submergence is no local phenomenon, but a widespread movement\r\nof depression which must greatly have altered the physical geography\r\nof north-western Europe during times within the memory of man. This\r\nevidence deserves a separate chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE DOGGER BANK\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the last 50 years it has been known to geologists that the\r\nbed of the North Sea yields numerous bones of large land animals,\r\nbelonging in great part to extinct species. These were first obtained\r\nby oyster-dredgers, and later by trawlers. Fortunately a good\r\ncollection of them was secured by the British Museum, where it has\r\nbeen carefully studied by William Davies. The bones came from two\r\nlocalities. One of them, close to the Norfolk coast off Happisburgh,\r\nyielded mainly teeth of _Elephas meridionalis_, and its fossils were\r\nevidently derived from the Pliocene Cromer Forest-bed, which in that\r\nneighbourhood is rapidly being destroyed by the sea. This need not\r\nnow detain us.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.—Showing approximate Coast-line at the period\r\nof the lowest Submerged Forest.]\r\n\r\nThe other locality is far more extraordinary. In the middle of the\r\nNorth Sea lies the extensive shoal known as the Dogger Bank, about\r\n60 or 70 miles from the nearest land. This shoal forms a wide\r\nirregular plateau having an area nearly as big as Denmark. Over\r\nit for the most part the sea has a depth of only 50 or 60 feet;\r\nall round its edge it slopes somewhat abruptly into deeper water,\r\nabout 150 feet in the south, east, and west, but much deeper on\r\nthe north. This peculiar bank has been explained as an eastward\r\nsubmerged continuation of the Oolite escarpment of Yorkshire; or,\r\nalternatively, as a mere shoal accumulated through the effects of\r\nsome tidal eddy; but neither of these explanations will hold, for\r\nOolitic rocks do not occur there, and the bank has a core quite\r\nunlike the sand of the North Sea.\r\n\r\nWhen trawlers first visited the Dogger Bank its surface seems to\r\nhave been strewn with large bones of land animals and loose masses\r\nof peat, known to the fishermen as “moorlog,” and there were also\r\nmany erratic blocks in the neighbourhood. As all this refuse did much\r\ndamage to the trawls, and bruised the fish, the erratics and bones\r\nwere thrown into deeper water, and the large cakes of moorlog were\r\nbroken in pieces. A few of the erratics and some of the bones were\r\nhowever brought to Yarmouth as curiosities. Now the whole surface of\r\nthe Dogger Bank has been gone over again and again by the trawlers,\r\nand very few of the fossil bones are found; unfortunately no record\r\nseems to have been kept as to the exact place where these bones were\r\ntrawled.\r\n\r\nThe species found were:—\r\n\r\n  Ursus (bear)\r\n  Canis lupus (wolf)\r\n  Hyaena spelaea (hyaena)\r\n  Cervus megaceros (Irish elk)\r\n     ”   tarandus (reindeer)\r\n     ”   elaphus (red-deer)\r\n     ”   a fourth species\r\n  Bos primigenius (wild ox)\r\n  Bison priscus (bison)\r\n  Equus caballus (horse)\r\n  Rhinoceros tichorhinus (woolly rhinoceros)\r\n  Elephas primigenius (mammoth)\r\n  Castor fiber (beaver)\r\n  Trichechus rosmarus (walrus)\r\n\r\nThough mammalian bones are now so seldom found, whenever the\r\nsand-banks shift slightly, as they tend to do under the influence\r\nof tides and currents, the edges of the submerged plateau are laid\r\nbare, exposing submarine ledges of moorlog, which still yield a\r\ncontinuous supply of this material. Messrs. Whitehead and Goodchild\r\nhave recently published an excellent account of it, having obtained\r\nfrom the trawlers numerous slabs of the peculiar peaty deposit, with\r\nparticulars as to the latitude and longitude in which the specimens\r\nwere dredged. Mrs Reid and I have to thank the authors for an\r\nopportunity of examining samples of the material, which has yielded\r\nmost interesting evidence as to the physical history, botany, and\r\nclimatic conditions of this sunken land. The following account is\r\nmainly taken from their paper and our appendix to it.\r\n\r\nWe are still without information as to the exact positions of the\r\nsubmarine ledges and cliffs of peat from which the masses have been\r\ntorn; but there seems little doubt that some of them were actually\r\ntorn off by the trawl. One block sent to me was full of recently dead\r\nhalf-grown _Pholas parva_, all of one age, and must evidently have\r\nbeen torn off the solid ledge. _Pholas_ never makes its home in loose\r\nblocks. We unfortunately know very little about the natural history\r\nof the boring mollusca and their length of life. If, as I think, this\r\nspecies takes two years to reach full growth, then it is evident that\r\nthe ledge of moorlog full of half-grown specimens must have been\r\nexposed to the sea continuously for one year, but not for longer. It\r\nought also perhaps to tell us the depth of water from which the mass\r\nwas torn; but nothing is known as to the depth to which _Pholas_ may\r\nextend—it has the reputation of occurring between tide-marks or just\r\nbelow, but it may extend downwards wherever there is a submarine\r\ncliff.\r\n\r\nThough we are still unable to locate exactly these submarine ledges\r\nor fix their depth below the sea, the blocks of moorlog are so widely\r\ndistributed around the Dogger Bank, and have been dredged in such\r\nlarge masses, that it seems clear that a “submerged forest” forms\r\npart of the core of the bank. As nothing else approaching to a solid\r\nstratum appears to be dredged over this shoal, we may assume that\r\nthe moorlog forms a sort of cap or cornice at a depth of about 10\r\nfathoms, overlying loose sandy strata, and perhaps boulder clay,\r\nwhich extend downward to another 10 fathoms, or 120 feet altogether.\r\nUnfortunately we cannot say from what deposit the large bones of\r\nextinct animals were washed; they may come from the sands below the\r\nmoorlog, but it is quite as probable that the Pleistocene deposits\r\nformed islands in the ancient fen—as they do now in East Anglia,\r\nHolderness, and Holland.\r\n\r\nMore than one submerged forest may be present on the Dogger Bank. The\r\nmasses of moorlog are usually dredged on the slopes at a depth of\r\n22 or 23 fathoms; but at the south-west end it occurs on the top as\r\nwell as on the slope, the sea-bottom on which the moorlog is found\r\nconsisting of fine grey sand, probably an estuarine silt connected\r\nwith the submerged forest, for the North Sea sand is commonly coarse\r\nand gritty.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the moorlog itself and its contents, it is possible\r\nthat some of the mammals in the list, such as the reindeer, beaver,\r\nand walrus, may belong to this upper deposit; but we have no means of\r\ndistinguishing them, as the bones were all found loose and free from\r\nthe matrix. The insects and plants were all obtained from slabs of\r\nthis peat.\r\n\r\nThe dredged cakes of peat handed to us for examination came from\r\ndifferent parts of the Bank; but they were all very similar in\r\ncharacter, and showed only the slight differences found in different\r\nparts of the same fen. The bed is essentially a fen-deposit of purely\r\norganic origin, with little trace of inorganic mud. It is fissile\r\nand very hard when dry, and in it are scattered a certain number of\r\nfairly well-preserved seeds, principally belonging to the bog-bean.\r\nOther recognisable plant-remains are not abundant. They consist of\r\nrare willow-leaves, fragments of birch-wood and bark, pieces of the\r\nscalariform tissue and sporangia of a fern, and moss, and, curiously\r\nenough, of groups of stamens of willow-herb with well-preserved\r\npollen-grains, though the whole of the rest of the plant to which\r\nthey belonged had decayed.\r\n\r\nThe material is exceptionally tough, and is very difficult to\r\ndisintegrate. In order to remove the structureless humus which\r\ncomposed the greater part of the peat, we found it necessary to break\r\nit into thin flakes and boil it in a strong soda solution for three\r\nor four days. Afterwards the material was passed through a sieve,\r\nthe fine flocculent parts being washed away by a stream of water,\r\nthe undecomposed plant remains being left behind in a state for\r\nexamination. These remains were mixed with a large amount of shreds\r\nof cuticle, etc., but recognisable leaves were not found in the\r\nwashed material.\r\n\r\nThe general result of our examination is to suggest that the deposit\r\ncomes from the middle of some vast fen, so far from rising land that\r\nall terrigenous material has been strained out of the peaty water.\r\nThe vegetation, as far as we have yet seen, consists exclusively\r\nof swamp species, with no admixture of hard-seeded edible fruits,\r\nusually so widely distributed by birds, and no wind-borne composites.\r\nThe sea was probably some distance away, as there is little sign of\r\nbrackish-water plants, or even of plants which usually occur within\r\nreach of an occasional tide; one piece however yielded seeds of\r\n_Ruppia_. The climate to which the plants point may be described as\r\nnorthern. The white-birch, sallow and hazel were the only trees; the\r\nalder is absent. All the plants have a high northern range, and one,\r\nthe dwarf Arctic-birch, is never found at sea-level in latitudes\r\nas far south as the Dogger Bank (except very rarely in the Baltic\r\nprovinces of Germany).\r\n\r\nThe plants already found are:—\r\n\r\n  Ranunculus Lingua\r\n  Castalia alba\r\n  Cochlearia sp.\r\n  Lychnis Flos-cuculi\r\n  Arenaria trinervia\r\n  Spiraea Ulmaria\r\n  Rubus fruticosus\r\n  Epilobium sp.\r\n  Galium sp.\r\n  Valeriana officinalis\r\n  Menyanthes trifoliata\r\n  Lycopus europaeus\r\n  Atriplex patula\r\n  Betula alba\r\n    ”    nana\r\n  Corylus Avellana\r\n  Salix repens\r\n    ”   aurita\r\n  Sparganium simplex\r\n  Alisma Plantago\r\n  Potamogeton natans\r\n  Ruppia rostellata\r\n  Scirpus sp.\r\n  Carex sp.\r\n  Phragmites communis\r\n\r\nAmong the nine species of beetle determined by Mr G. C. Champion it\r\nis noticeable that two belong to sandy places. This suggests that the\r\nfen may have had its seaward edge protected by a belt of sand-dunes,\r\njust as the coast of Holland is at the present day.\r\n\r\nThis submerged forest in the middle of the North Sea has been\r\ndescribed fully, for it raises a host of interesting questions,\r\nthat require much more research before we can answer them. A sunken\r\nland-surface 60 feet and more below the sea at high-tide corresponds\r\nvery closely with the lowest of the submerged forests met with in our\r\ndock-excavations. But if another bed of peat occurs at a depth of 130\r\nor 140 feet at the Dogger Bank, this would be far below the level\r\nof any recently sunk land-surface yet recognised in Britain. Also,\r\nif the slabs of very modern-looking peat, containing only plants\r\nand insects still living in Britain, come from such a depth, out of\r\nwhat older deposit can the Pleistocene mammals, such as elephant,\r\nrhinoceros, and hyaena, have been washed?\r\n\r\nThese questions cannot be answered conclusively without scientific\r\ndredging, to fix the exact positions and depths of the outcrops of\r\nmoorlog. When we remember also that beneath a submerged forest at\r\nabout the depth of the Dogger Bank there was found at Tilbury, in\r\nthe Thames Valley, a human skeleton; and that both human remains and\r\nstone implements have been discovered in similar deposits elsewhere,\r\nwe can point to the Dogger Bank as an excellent field for scientific\r\nexploration.\r\n\r\nThe Dogger Bank once formed the northern edge of a great alluvial\r\nplain, occupying what is now the southern half of the North Sea, and\r\nstretching across to Holland and Denmark. If we go beyond the Dogger\r\nBank and seek for answers to these questions on the further shore,\r\nwe find moorlog washed up abundantly on the coasts of both Holland\r\nand Denmark, and it has evidently been torn off submerged ledges like\r\nthose of the Bank. Numerous borings in Holland give us still further\r\ninformation, for they show that beneath the wide alluvial plain,\r\nwhich lies close to the level of the sea, there exists a considerable\r\nthickness of modern strata. At Amsterdam, for instance, two beds\r\nof peat are met with well below the sea-level, the upper occurring\r\nat about the level of low-tide, the lower at a depth of about 50\r\nor 60 feet below mean-tide. That is to say, the lowest submerged\r\nland-surface is found in Holland at just about the same depth as it\r\noccurs in England, and probably on the Dogger Bank also.\r\n\r\nBelow this submerged land-surface at Amsterdam are found marine\r\nclays and sands, which seem to show that the lowest “continental\r\ndeposit,” as it is called by Dutch geologists, spread seaward over\r\nthe silted-up bed of the North Sea; but no buried land-surfaces have\r\nyet been found below the 60-foot level anywhere in Holland.\r\n\r\nThis appearance of two distinct and thick peat-beds, underlain,\r\nseparated, and overlaid by marine deposits, seems to characterise\r\ngreat part of the Dutch plain. It points to a long period of\r\nsubsidence, broken by two intervals of stationary sea-level, when\r\npeat-mosses flourished and spread far and wide over the flat,\r\ninterspersed with shallow lakes, like the Norfolk broads.\r\n\r\nThe enclosed and almost tideless Baltic apparently tells the same\r\nstory, for at Rostock at its southern end, a submerged peat-bed has\r\nbeen met with at a depth of 46 feet.\r\n\r\nOn passing northward into Scandinavia we enter an area in which,\r\nas in Scotland, recent changes in sea-level have been complicated\r\nby tilting, so that ancient beach-lines no longer correspond in\r\nelevation at different places. The deformation has been so great\r\nthat it is impossible to trace the submerged forests; they may be\r\nrepresented in the north by the raised beaches, which in Norway and\r\nSweden, as in Scotland and the north of Ireland, seem to belong to\r\na far more recent period than the raised beaches of the south of\r\nEngland. It seems useless to attempt to continue our researches on\r\nsubmerged forests further in this direction, especially as during the\r\nlatest stages, when we know England was sinking, Gothland appears to\r\nhave been slowly rising. Those who wish to learn about the changes\r\nthat took place in the south of Sweden should refer to the recent\r\nmonograph by Dr Munthe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE IRISH SEA AND THE BRISTOL CHANNEL\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the west coast of Scotland, as on the east, the succession of\r\nevents seems to have been quite different from that which can be\r\nproved further south. It looks as though we must seek for equivalents\r\nof our submerged forests in certain very modern looking raised\r\nbeaches and estuarine deposits, such as those of the Clyde. Even when\r\nwe move southward to the Isle of Man deeply submerged post-glacial\r\nland-surfaces appear to be unknown, though there is evidence of a\r\nslight sinking, and roots of trees are found a few feet below the\r\nsea-level. In the Isle of Man we still come across the modern-looking\r\nraised beaches so prevalent in Scotland though unknown in England.\r\n\r\nThe Lancashire and Cheshire coasts, with their numerous deep\r\nestuaries and extensive flats, are noted, however, for their\r\nsubmerged forests, sometimes seen on the foreshore between\r\ntide-marks, sometimes laid open in the extensive dock or harbour\r\nworks. The Heysham Harbour excavations, for instance, were carried\r\nfar below sea-level and a thin peat-bed was met with in a boring at\r\n52 feet below Ordnance datum. Mellard Reade considered this peat\r\nonce to have been continuous with an ancient land-surface seen\r\nbetween tide-marks. A boring is not altogether satisfactory evidence\r\nfor the occurrence of a land-surface at such a depth; but if it is\r\ntrustworthy it points to a subsidence of about 60 feet, an amount\r\nidentical with that observed in the Thames Valley.\r\n\r\nThe estuaries of the Ribble, Mersey, and Dee tell a similar story,\r\nfor on their shores and under their marshes are found some of the\r\nmost extensive submerged land-surfaces now traceable in Britain. Many\r\naccounts of these have been published; but the alternations of marine\r\nwith freshwater strata and with land-surfaces are so like those\r\nalready described that a short account will suffice.\r\n\r\nCarefully plotted engineer’s sections will be found in Mellard\r\nReade’s papers, and his account of the succession is so interesting\r\nthat it is worth quoting. He postulates two periods of elevation,\r\nalternating with three periods of depression; but in this area, as\r\nin the Thames Valley, it appears as though all the phenomena can be\r\naccounted for by one long period of intermittent depression. His\r\ngeneralised section of the deposits in these estuaries is as follows:—\r\n\r\n  3rd period      { Blown sand\r\n  of depression   {\r\n                  { Recent silts with beds of peat;\r\n                  {   _Scrobicularia_, occasional\r\n                  {   freshwater shells, red-deer, horse,\r\n                  {   _Bos primigenius_, _Bos longifrons_,\r\n                  {   and human skull\r\n\r\n  2nd period      } Superior peat- and forest-bed\r\n  of elevation    }\r\n  2nd period     { Formby and Leasowe marine beds; human\r\n  of depression  {   skeleton, bones of horse and red-deer,\r\n                 {   _Scrobicularia_, _Tellina baltica_,\r\n                 {   _Turritella communis_, etc.\r\n\r\n  1st period     } Inferior peat- and forest-bed\r\n  of elevation   }\r\n\r\n  1st period     { Washed drift-sand (apparently no\r\n  of depression  {   contemporaneous fossils)\r\n                 { Boulder clay\r\n\r\nIt may be an accidental coincidence; but it is noteworthy that both\r\nthe Mersey and Thames show two main peat-beds separated by marine\r\nstrata.\r\n\r\nThe forest exposed on the foreshore at Leasowe (frontispiece) is a\r\nparticularly good example of these old land-surfaces, and it is often\r\nvisible. It evidently once formed a wet, peaty flat on which grew\r\nswamp plants, brushwood, and some large trees. Parts of it show a\r\nperfect network of the rhizomes of _Osmunda_. This “superior peat-\r\nand forest-bed” was forming when the sea was only a few feet below\r\nits present level. The “inferior peat- and forest-bed” probably\r\nindicates a drier soil; but it is difficult to get at and requires\r\nfuller investigation.\r\n\r\nThe excavation for an extension of the Barry Docks, in\r\nGlamorganshire, exposed in 1895 an interesting succession of\r\ndeposits, and fortunately a particularly competent observer, Dr\r\nStrahan, was on the spot to note them and their exact levels. He\r\nalso obtained masses of material from each of the beds, and from an\r\nexamination of the contents of these I was able to gather a clear\r\nidea of the changes of sea-level which had affected this part of\r\nSouth Wales. The following sequence was met with:—\r\n\r\n  1. Blown sand.                           }\r\n                                           } Recent subaerial\r\n  2. _Scrobicularia_-clay.            }     and\r\n  1. Blown sand.                           }   tidal deposits.\r\n  3. Sand and gravel with rolled           }\r\n  shells (_Scrobicularia_, _Tellina_,     }\r\n  _Cardium_, _Patella_, _Littorina_).}\r\n\r\nStrong line of erosion.\r\n\r\n4. Blue silt with many sedges, and at the bottom a few foraminifera.\r\n\r\n5. _The Upper Peat Bed_, about four feet below Ordnance datum\r\nand fairly constant in level. It ranges from one to two feet in\r\nthickness, and where fully developed it presents the following\r\ndetails:—\r\n\r\n  5 _a._ Laminated peat with logs of willow, fir and oak, passing\r\n  down into\r\n\r\n  5 _b._ Light-coloured flexible marl composed of ostracoda with much\r\n  vegetable matter.\r\n\r\n  5 _c._ Shell-marl composed principally of _Limnaea_, _Bythinia_,\r\n  etc., with ostracoda and much vegetable matter. This seam must have\r\n  been formed in a nearly freshwater tidal marsh; it yielded _Najas\r\n  marina_, a plant now confined to Norfolk.\r\n\r\n  5 _d._ Peat with logs of oak, etc. A Neolithic worked flint\r\n  was found by Mr Storrie in this seam, three inches below the\r\n  shell-marl. This implement is a fragment of a polished flint celt,\r\n  which seems to have been used subsequently as a strike-a-light. Two\r\n  bone needles are said to have been found in this peat-bed during\r\n  the construction of the first Barry Dock.\r\n\r\n6. Blue silty clay with many sedges. From five to seven feet in\r\nthickness.\r\n\r\n7. _The Second Peat_ is an impersistent brown band, a few inches in\r\nthickness, composed mainly of _Scirpus maritimus_. It suggests merely\r\nthat for the time plant-remains were accumulating more rapidly than\r\nmud.\r\n\r\n8. Blue silty clay, like Nos. 6 and 4. In its upper part, immediately\r\nunder the peat bed No. 7, it contains land and salt-marsh shells,\r\n_Helix arbustorum_, _Pupa_, _Melampus myosotis_, _Hydrobia ventrosa_.\r\nUpright stems of a sedge, probably _Scirpus maritimus_, occur\r\nthroughout this bed as through all the other silts.\r\n\r\n9. _The Third Peat_ occurs at or close to the bottom of the dock,\r\nat 20 feet below Ordnance datum. It rarely exceeds eight inches in\r\nthickness, but is persistent. In several places it is made up almost\r\nentirely of large timber, both trunks and stools of trees, while in\r\none section roots and rootlets extended downward from the peat into a\r\nsoil composed of disintegrated Keuper Marl. Mr Storrie identified oak\r\nand roots of a conifer. On washing a sample collected at a few yards’\r\ndistance, I found it to consist of a tough mass of vegetable matter,\r\nprincipally sallow and reed, both roots and stems. It also contained\r\nseeds of _Valeriana officinalis_ and _Carex_, and elytra of beetles.\r\nThere was no evidence of salt water.\r\n\r\nAt this point it will be observed that the floor of Keuper Marl\r\nrises, and Bed 9 abuts against it. Beds 10, 11 and 12 lay below\r\nthe dock bottom, and were exposed only in the excavation for the\r\nfoundations of walls, etc. Fortunately, Dr Strahan was able to\r\nexamine a good exposure of the important part of them.\r\n\r\n10. The section commenced at the dock bottom—that is, at the peat\r\nlast described (No. 9); in the upper part it was timbered up, but at\r\na depth of about nine feet, blue silty clay of the usual character\r\ncould be seen and dug out through the timbers. This was followed\r\nby two feet of greenish sandy silt full of reeds, and containing\r\nleaves of willow, and land and freshwater shells, such as _Limnaea\r\nauricularia_, _Planorbis albus_, _P. nautileus_, _Hydrobia ventrosa_,\r\n_Valvata piscinalis_, _V. cristata_. The plants were _Salix caprea_\r\nand _Phragmites_.\r\n\r\n11. Peat with much broken oak-wood, mixed with seeds and freshwater\r\nshells. The plants obtained were oak, hazel, cornel, hawthorn,\r\nbur-reed and sallow.\r\n\r\n12. Reddish clayey gravel with land shells and penetrated by roots,\r\npassing down into red and green grits, limestone and marls. This\r\ngravel is undoubtedly an old land-surface, lying at a depth of 35\r\nfeet below Ordnance datum. This old soil contains:—\r\n\r\n  Carychium minimum\r\n  Helix arbustorum\r\n    ”   rotundata\r\n    ”   hispida\r\n  Hyalinia\r\n  Succinea\r\n  Limnaea truncatula\r\n  Pupa\r\n  Valvata piscinalis\r\n  Cardium edule (two fragments—probably brought by gulls)\r\n  Crataegus Oxyacantha (seed)\r\n  Cornus sanguinea (seed)\r\n  Quercus Robur (wood)\r\n\r\nThe examination of these deposits made it perfectly clear that the\r\nlowest land-surface represents a true forest-growth, such as could\r\nonly live at an elevation clear of the highest tides; one tide of\r\nbrackish water in the year would have sufficed to alter markedly the\r\ncharacter of the fauna and flora of the deposit. Dr Strahan, assuming\r\nthat the range of the tides was the same as at the present day, and\r\nnoting the present highest level to which the salt-marshes reach,\r\ncomes to the conclusion that 55 feet at least is the amount of the\r\nsubsidence. I should be inclined to add a few feet more, in order to\r\nkeep the oak-roots well clear of the highest tide during a westerly\r\ngale. An exceptional gale occurring only once during the lifetime of\r\nan oak might bank up the sea water sufficiently to kill the tree, if\r\nit grew at a lower elevation.\r\n\r\nIt may be argued that when the land stood at the higher level the\r\nrange of the tides was less, and that consequently the amount of\r\nthe proved subsidence may not be so great as 55 feet. The old\r\nland-surface on which the oaks grew lies, however, 35 feet below\r\n_mean tide_, so that any supposed lesser tidal range in ancient times\r\ncould not make any great difference in the amount of subsidence here\r\nproved—it cannot be less than 45 feet. When, however, we notice\r\nthe rapid increase in the range of the tides at the present day as\r\nthe channel narrows towards Chepstow, and think what would be the\r\nprobable effect of raising the whole country 50 or 60 feet, we are\r\ncompelled to think that any narrowing and shoaling of the channel\r\nwould have the effect of increasing, not decreasing, the tidal range\r\nat Barry Docks. In short it looks as if when the lowest submerged\r\nforest grew, the abnormal tides of Bristol may have extended further\r\nwest, to near Cardiff.\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been the exact range of the tides in these early\r\ndays, it seems that the Bristol Channel points to a subsidence in\r\npost-glacial times of about 60 feet—or just the same amount as the\r\nThames, Humber, and Mersey. The amount may have been more; but the\r\nBarry Dock sections show that it cannot have been less; we will\r\nreturn to the question of its maximum extent later on.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving this locality it may be well to enquire what further\r\nlight it sheds on the movement of submergence, and on its continuous\r\nor intermittent character. The succession of the strata above the\r\nlowest land-surface, and the nature of their enclosed fossils,\r\nsuggest long-continued but intermittent subsidence; I can see,\r\nhowever, no indication of a reversal of the process. The land-surface\r\nis carried beneath the water, the estuary then silts up, becomes\r\nfresh water, marsh-plants grow, and even trees may flourish on this\r\nmarsh before it subsides again. But there is no sign that the strata\r\nwere ever raised above the level to which ordinary floods could build\r\nup an alluvial flat. The land-surfaces seem always to have been\r\nswampy, and bed succeeds bed in fairly regular sequence, without the\r\ndeep channelling we might expect to find when an alluvial flat was\r\nraised to a noticeable extent above the level of high water.\r\n\r\nThe width of the Bristol Channel makes it clear that this gulf must\r\noccupy a submerged valley of great antiquity. It becomes therefore of\r\ninterest to enquire whether the wide valley is correspondingly deep,\r\nor whether its rocky floor is found at the same shallow depth as in\r\nthe case of the other river-valleys which we have been considering.\r\nThe wide valley may have been formed in either of two ways. It may\r\nhave been excavated as a deep valley with its bottom many hundred\r\nfeet below the present sea-level. Or it may have commenced as the\r\nshallow valley of a big river with exceptionally powerful tides, and\r\nas this river swung from side to side it greatly widened its valley\r\nwithout making it any deeper.\r\n\r\nPossibly a deep channel may exist towards the Atlantic; but we know\r\nthat none extends as far up as Bristol. Near Bristol the Severn\r\nTunnel was carried through Carboniferous and Triassic rock, and\r\nshowed that no buried channel is found much below the present one,\r\nwhich here happens to be scoured by the tides to an exceptional\r\ndepth. The bottom of the old channel cannot be more than 40 feet\r\nbelow the bottom of the present channel known as The Shoots.\r\n\r\nIt may be that the Severn was once prolonged seaward as a swift river\r\nfalling in a series of rapids over hard ledges of Palaeozoic rocks;\r\nbut of this there is no evidence. It also does not seem probable, for\r\nall the geological indications go to suggest that west of Bristol\r\nthe Channel coincides in the main with a wide area once occupied by\r\ncomparatively soft Secondary or even Tertiary rocks. However this\r\nmay be, we can only trace an ancient post-glacial channel cutting to\r\nabout the same depth as the channels of the other rivers, and the\r\nlowest submerged land-surface of Barry Docks corresponds quite well\r\nwith an alluvial flat formed when the river ran at that level. Here\r\nagain we seem to find the river cutting to an ancient base-level\r\nwhich was about 60 feet below the present sea.\r\n\r\nThe reader may perhaps think that this point, the limited range of\r\nthe upward and downward movements in post-glacial times, is being\r\ninsisted on with wearisome iteration. But the insistence is necessary\r\nwhen we remember how constantly both geologists and naturalists, in\r\norder to account for anomalies in the geographical distribution of\r\nanimals and plants, bring into play such movements. The argument\r\nis constantly used, that a certain species cannot cross the sea:\r\ntherefore if it is found in an island, that island must once have\r\nbeen connected with the mainland. Nature is more full of resource\r\nthan we imagine, and does not thus neglect her children. The\r\ncumulative effect of rare accidents spread over many thousand years\r\nis also far greater than may be thought by those who only consider\r\nwhat has been noted since means of dispersal have been studied\r\nscientifically.\r\n\r\nAn examination of the south side of the Bristol Channel need not\r\nlong delay us, except for two pieces of evidence which should not be\r\npassed over. In Somerset there are wide expanses of marsh land known\r\nas the Bridgwater and Glastonbury Levels. These greatly resemble the\r\nFenland, and like it are underlain by a submerged rock-platform which\r\nhas sunk in post-glacial times. But in this case we are able to fix a\r\ndefinite historical date by which all movement had ceased—it may have\r\nceased much earlier, but we can prove that at any rate there has been\r\nno change of the sea-level subsequent to a certain date.\r\n\r\nThe Glastonbury Levels lie at about the height of ordinary high\r\ntides, and the channels through them would still be tidal were it\r\nnot for the banks which keep out the sea. Some years ago there\r\nwere discovered on the surface of these marshes a number of low\r\nmounds, which on excavation proved to be the remains of a village of\r\nlake-dwellings, approached by a boat-channel, by the side of which\r\nwere the remains of a rough landing stage. The dwelling-places rested\r\non the old salt-marsh vegetation, brushwood and soil being used\r\nto raise their floors above the level of the highest tides. It is\r\nevident that when this village was inhabited the sea-level must have\r\nbeen the same as now, or within a foot or two of its present height.\r\nIf the sea-level was then higher, the village could not be inhabited;\r\nif it were lower the channel would not have been navigable and the\r\nlanding stage would have been useless. The archaeological remains\r\nfound in this village prove that it belongs to a period dating about\r\nthe first century B.C. or the first century A.D.\r\n\r\nAnother locality on the south side of the Bristol Channel which we\r\nmust not pass without notice is Westward Ho, in Bideford Bay. There\r\nis nothing exceptional about the submerged forest at this place, but\r\nit has been carefully studied and collected from by Mr Inkermann\r\nRogers, and it may be taken as a typical example of such deposits in\r\nthe south of England.\r\n\r\nThe peaty deposits and old land-surface here seen between tide-marks\r\nare rapidly being destroyed by the sea and are now much thinner than\r\nthey were a few years since. The soil on which the trees, here mainly\r\noaks, are rooted consists of a blue clay full of small pebbles and\r\nfragments of the Culm Measure grit. Among these stones are numerous\r\nflint-flakes made by man; but metal implements and pottery, so\r\ncommon in the later deposits at Glastonbury, have not been found.\r\nThis ancient land-surface lies several feet below high water; it\r\nshows therefore that the latest movement of depression dates from a\r\nperiod between this Neolithic deposit and the Celtic lake-dwelling of\r\nGlastonbury.\r\n\r\nThe possibility of fixing an approximate date for this submerged\r\nforest, through its numerous flint-flakes and the accompanying bones\r\nof domesticated animals, makes its contents of great interest, for\r\nit shows how recently the movement has ceased—probably not more than\r\n3500 years ago. It will be worth while therefore to give a fuller\r\naccount of the contents of this soil and its overlying peat-bed.\r\n\r\nAs regards articles of human workmanship, I have seen nothing\r\nbut waste flakes of flint and perhaps flint knives; and though\r\ngood implements may at any time be discovered, neither chipped\r\nnor polished tools seem yet to have been found. Human remains are\r\nrepresented by a clavicle.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying mammals are the stag, Celtic shorthorn, horse, dog\r\n(a very slender breed), sheep, goat, and pig, all of which, except\r\nthe stag, seem to be domestic animals. Dr Chas. Andrews remarks that\r\nthe ox seems to be certainly the Celtic shorthorn (_Bos longifrons_),\r\nwhile the small sheep is a characteristic Romano-British form, which\r\nhas been described from many places, where it has been found with\r\nRoman and earlier remains.\r\n\r\nA number of seeds were obtained from the peat which rests on this\r\nold land-surface, and it is noticeable that several of them belong\r\nto brackish water or sea-coast plants. No cultivated species have\r\nyet been found, either here or elsewhere, in even the newest of the\r\nsubmerged forests. The list of plants is still a small one; but it\r\nmay be worth giving, to show what species can be identified. It must\r\nnot be forgotten that in such deposits plants which do not possess\r\neither deciduous leaves or hard seeds leave no recognisable traces,\r\nthough they may have been quite as abundant as the hazel, of which\r\neveryone notices the nuts. The seeds belong to:—\r\n\r\n  Ranunculus Flammula\r\n      ”      repens\r\n      ”      sceleratus\r\n  Viola\r\n  Malachium aquaticum\r\n  Stellaria media\r\n  Lychnis Flos-cuculi\r\n  Rubus fruticosus\r\n  Callitriche\r\n  Cornus sanguinea\r\n  Sambucus nigra\r\n  Aster Tripolium\r\n  Solanum Dulcamara\r\n  Ajuga reptans\r\n  Sueda maritima\r\n  Atriplex patula\r\n  Rumex\r\n  Urtica dioica\r\n  Alnus glutinosa\r\n  Corylus Avellana\r\n  Quercus robur\r\n  Alisma Plantago\r\n  Ruppia maritima\r\n  Eleocharis palustris\r\n  Scirpus Tabernaemontani\r\n  Carex 3 sp.\r\n\r\nIn this list, as is usually the case with the newest submerged\r\nforest, we find only plants that are still living in the immediate\r\nneighbourhood. Also, only such plants as are widely distributed are\r\nhere found as fossils, the characteristic west-country flora being\r\nunrepresented. The reason of this limitation will be discussed later.\r\n\r\nFor various reasons, which will be explained later, it will be well\r\nbefore describing the submerged land-surfaces of Cornwall and the\r\nAtlantic coast, to complete the account of those surrounding our\r\nenclosed seas. We will therefore take next those bordering on the\r\nEnglish Channel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE ENGLISH CHANNEL\r\n\r\n\r\nThe English Channel, like our other enclosed seas, is bordered on\r\neither side by a fringe of ancient alluvia and submerged forests,\r\nwhich however are fast disappearing through the attacks of the waves.\r\nThe destruction is so rapid, and in many parts has been so complete,\r\nthat we are apt to forget how altered is the appearance of the\r\nEnglish coast. Even so recently as the time of Caesar’s invasion flat\r\nmuddy shores or low gravelly plains occupied many parts of the coast\r\nwhere we now see cliffs and rocky ledges.\r\n\r\nWe will not labour this point, which must be obvious to anyone who\r\nhas noticed how little the low terrace which still fringes great part\r\nof the Sussex coast can resist the waves, and how quickly it is eaten\r\naway during storms. Any restoration of our coast-line for the time of\r\nCaesar must take these changes into account.\r\n\r\nThe material thus being removed by the attacks of the sea is partly\r\nPleistocene gravel, partly alluvium of later date; and the alluvial\r\nstrata with their accompanying buried land-surfaces resemble so\r\nclosely those already described that we need not linger long over\r\ntheir description.\r\n\r\nIf we commence at the Strait of Dover we are immediately confronted\r\nwith clear evidence of the change of sea-level. Submerged forests are\r\nwell seen between tide-marks in Pegwell Bay, and valleys with their\r\nseaward ends submerged and forming harbours are conspicuous in Kent.\r\nOwing to local conditions, the valleys are mostly narrow and steep,\r\nand the small harbours therefore soon filled up, or were lost through\r\nthe cutting back of the cliffs on either side. Possibly in Caesar’s\r\nday good natural harbours were still in existence here.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately on this part of the coast the study of coastal changes\r\nhas been involved in a good deal of needless obscurity. Many\r\nwriters, even geologists, make no clear distinction between loss by\r\nsubmergence and loss by marine erosion. We are told, for instance,\r\nthat the Goodwin Sands were land about 900 years ago, and that this\r\nland disappeared during an exceptional storm. We are sometimes even\r\ntold that here and elsewhere walls are still visible beneath the\r\nsea. Popular writers, to add to the confusion, have some hazy notion\r\nthat these changes are connected with the existence of submerged\r\nforests or “Noah’s Woods,” and that these again are evidence of a\r\nuniversal deluge. The whole of the arguments are strangely tangled,\r\nand we must try and make things a little clearer before passing on.\r\nAn understanding of the changes which have taken place on this part\r\nof the coast is needed for historical purposes, and still more needed\r\nif we make a study of the origin of the existing fauna and flora of\r\nBritain.\r\n\r\nOne of the crucial questions, both for the naturalist and\r\narchaeologist, is the date at which Britain was finally severed from\r\nthe Continent. Did this happen within the range of written history,\r\nor tradition? Or if earlier, did it take place after or before\r\nclimatic conditions had become such as we now experience? For the\r\nproper understanding of many different problems it is essential to\r\nsettle this point.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely satisfactory to read history backwards, though\r\ngeologists are often compelled thus to work from the known to the\r\nunknown. We will therefore not in this case ask our readers to follow\r\nus through the detailed evidence and arguments which have enabled\r\ngeologists stage by stage to reconstruct the physical geography\r\nof this part of Britain as it was in days before written history.\r\nThey must take this preliminary work for granted, and allow the\r\ndescription of the changes to be taken in their correct historical\r\norder.\r\n\r\nWe need not go back far geologically. In late Tertiary (probably\r\nNewer Pliocene) times there was a ridge of chalk joining the range of\r\nthe North Downs to the corresponding hills of France; but the divide\r\nbetween the North Sea and the English Channel was low at this point.\r\nAfterwards, during the Glacial Epoch, when an ice-sheet accumulated\r\nand blocked the northern outlet of the North Sea, the water was\r\nponded back in the southern part. There was no easy outlet northward\r\nfor the water of the Rhine and other great rivers, so the level of\r\nthe North Sea rose slightly till it overflowed this low col and cut\r\nan outlet where lies the present Strait of Dover.\r\n\r\nThe general sea-level during this period of glaciation seems to have\r\nbeen a few feet higher than that of the present day, for glacially\r\ntransported erratics are found strewn over the flat coastal plain of\r\nSussex. One erratic block, probably derived from the Channel Islands,\r\nwas discovered under the loess as far east as Sangatte cliff, close\r\nto Calais. The icy English Channel must therefore have met the icy\r\nNorth Sea some time during the Glacial Epoch.\r\n\r\nSome time after the cold had passed away there came in the period\r\nwith which this book deals—when the lowest submerged forest\r\nflourished, on land now 50 or 60 feet below the sea. This elevation\r\nof the land, as already shown, converted a great part of the North\r\nSea into a wide alluvial plain. At the same time it raised above the\r\nsea-level and obliterated the newly-formed strait, leaving it in all\r\nprobability as a shallow valley sloping both ways and filled up with\r\nalluvium. The Strait of Dover was again a watershed, or perhaps its\r\nposition was occupied by a small stream, which may have flowed in\r\neither direction.\r\n\r\nThus the work done during the Glacial Epoch was almost cancelled and\r\nhad to be done again; but now there was merely a low narrow divide\r\nof chalk and a strip of marsh between the two basins, and the chalk\r\nridge was steadily being attacked by the waves of the sea from the\r\nwest.\r\n\r\nWhen subsidence again set in the strip of alluvium was soon submerged\r\nand the two seas again met; but in all probability for a long time\r\nthe Strait was only a narrow one, over which animals could easily\r\nswim. Then tidal scour, deeper submergence, and the action of the\r\nwaves did the rest, so that ever since that time the Strait of Dover\r\nhas been getting steadily wider and wider, and also deeper. Its\r\nbottom is to a large extent composed of bare chalk with patches of\r\ngravel; and the movement of this gravel during storms, combined with\r\nthe action of boring molluscs must slowly eat away the chalk far\r\nbelow ordinary wave-action.\r\n\r\nThe above explanation is needed, for it will not do to take existing\r\nsoundings, and say that all the sea-bottom below a certain level,\r\ncorresponding with a particular submerged forest, was then sea and\r\nall above was then land. This is an easy way of reconstructing the\r\nphysical geography; but it may be a very misleading one. A little\r\nconsideration will show that whilst in large areas sand-banks have\r\naccumulated to a great thickness, in other areas, of which we know\r\nthe Strait of Dover is one and the Dogger Bank a second, there has\r\nbeen much submarine erosion, which is still going on. In neither case\r\nis it safe entirely to reconstruct the ancient contours from the\r\npresent-day soundings.\r\n\r\nEven such a gigantic feature as the continental platform, which\r\nceases suddenly at a depth of 100 fathoms, is in all probability in\r\nthe main a feature formed by the deposition of sediment during long\r\nages. Its outer edge marks, not the limit of some ancient continent,\r\nbut the limiting depth at which gentle wave-action has been felt, and\r\nbeyond which the sediment cannot be carried.\r\n\r\nAfter this necessary digression we must return to our study of the\r\nactual evidence for such changes of sea-level in the English Channel.\r\nIt has been pointed out already that for this purpose the present\r\ndepth below sea-level of the rocky floor of the Strait cannot in\r\nitself be accepted as sufficient evidence. Nor can the depth at which\r\nrock was met with under the Goodwin Sands; though here a cylinder was\r\nsunk 75 feet before it reached the chalk. Unfortunately no record of\r\nthe strata passed through seems to have been preserved, though it is\r\nperhaps implied that nothing but sea-sand was penetrated.\r\n\r\nRomney Marsh is a wide alluvial flat occupying a silted-up bay, the\r\nfloor of which in places lies at least 70 feet below sea-level. There\r\nare here unfortunately no extensive excavations for docks, and all we\r\ncan say is that the few borings which have penetrated the alluvial\r\nstrata prove the existence of a slightly undulating rock-surface\r\nbelow. In short Romney Marsh appears to be a submerged flat-bottomed\r\nopen valley, like that which we have already seen underlies the marsh\r\ndeposits of the Fenland.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Romney Marsh, however, it is doubtful whether\r\nsubmerged land-surfaces would be found at any great distance from the\r\nrising ground. There is a striking peculiarity about this marsh; it\r\nonly lies partly in a bay, the greater part of the area consisting of\r\nalluvial flats which have accumulated during recent centuries behind\r\nthe projecting shingle beaches of Dunge Ness. In short, the marsh\r\nsteadily gains on the sea, is advancing into fairly deep water, and\r\nthe parts near the Ness may be underlain by marine strata right down\r\nto the Wealden rocks below. The rock floor was met with at 58 feet\r\nbelow the marsh at Holmston Range, not far from the Ness; but we\r\nhave no information as to the character of the strata passed through\r\nbefore this floor was reached. In all probability this floor at 58\r\nfeet would be proved to be part of a true land-surface, could we\r\nexamine it.\r\n\r\nNear Hastings the submerged forests have long been known, and are\r\noften exposed on the foreshore between tide-marks. They contain\r\nantlers of deer, leaves, hazel nuts, acorns, and oak wood.\r\n\r\nThen we come to Pevensey Level, which is another of the submerged and\r\nsilted up wide flat-bottomed valleys, such as we have so often met\r\nwith. But as we have no details as to strata underlying this marsh we\r\nmust pass on.\r\n\r\nAlong the Sussex coast west of Beachy Head a series of south-flowing\r\nrivers reaches the sea, each cutting through the high chalk-hills\r\nof the South Downs. We need not discuss the origin of these peculiar\r\ncourses, which date back to the period when the central axis of the\r\nWeald was uplifted; that discussion would take too much time, and is\r\nhere unnecessary. We are now only concerned with the later stages of\r\nthe evolution of these river-valleys, each of which yields striking\r\nconfirmation of the view that a sinking of the land has taken place\r\nin comparatively modern times.\r\n\r\nAt the present day the tidal part of each of these rivers extends\r\nright through the Downs into the lower Wealden area, and it is\r\nobvious that their valleys tend to silt up, not to deepen, and\r\nscarcely anywhere to become wider. When we examine further we find\r\nthat the true valley-bottom lies far below the present alluvial flat;\r\nthough the scarcity of borings and the uncertainty of many of the\r\nrecords make it difficult to say exactly how deep it lies.\r\n\r\nIf we follow these rivers upwards we find that in each case the\r\nalluvial flat widens out greatly after we have passed the chalk-hills\r\nand reached the clay lands beyond. These wide flats, according to old\r\nideas, were formed by the swinging from side to side of the stream,\r\nwhich thus gradually widened its valley in the softer strata. If\r\nthis were the case in these instances, we should find a solid floor\r\nbeneath each marsh at a depth not exceeding that of the present\r\nriver-channels. The rivers, however, are not now cutting into rocky\r\nbanks or flowing over beds of Secondary strata; they are flowing\r\nsluggishly in the middle of alluvial flats, which tend to silt up\r\nwith every flood or exceptionally high tide.\r\n\r\nThus all the evidence seems to show that marshes like those near\r\nLewes and Amberley Wild Brook have originated through the submergence\r\nof flat-bottomed valleys cut in soft strata. The ponding back of the\r\nmuddy tidal water would soon lead to the silting-up of any shallow\r\nlakes left after this submergence.\r\n\r\nWhen the land stood 70 or 80 feet higher than it does now, the\r\ncountry must have looked very different. The rivers then traversed\r\nthe chalk downs through V-shaped comparatively narrow valleys; but\r\nthese valleys opened out in their upper reaches, where they crossed\r\nthe Gault and Weald Clay. If we could lay bare the true floor of\r\nthe valley, we should see however that there is always a steady and\r\nfairly regular fall seaward, just as there is in the part of its\r\ncourse which lies above the influence of the submergence, which is\r\nfelt for some 10 or 12 miles from the sea. Except on this theory of\r\nrecent submergence it seems impossible to account for these curious\r\nmarshes, with tributary valleys obviously plunging sharply beneath\r\nthem on either side; they are quite unlike the undulating flats\r\nwhich occur higher up.\r\n\r\nThe flat of Selsey Bill yields evidence of submerged land-surfaces\r\nopposite each of the shallow valleys; but here we meet with the same\r\ndifficulty which confronted us in the Thames Valley and on the east\r\ncoast. Pleistocene land-surfaces and alluvial deposits of early date\r\nare seen on the foreshore side by side with the more modern Neolithic\r\nalluvium and submerged forests. Unless great care is taken it may be\r\nthought that the well-preserved bones of rhinoceros and elephant, and\r\nthe shells of _Corbicula fluminalis_, come from the same alluvium\r\nthat yields Neolithic flint-flakes, or that plants such as the South\r\nEuropean _Cotoneaster Pyracantha_ flourished in Britain up to this\r\nrecent date. Except for the sake of warning against these sources of\r\nerror the submerged forests of Selsey Bill need not detain us.\r\n\r\nStill travelling westward we next arrive at the series of tidal\r\nharbours opening into Spithead, Southampton Water and the Solent. All\r\nof these are obviously continuations of the valleys which lengthen\r\nthem inland; and this is amply proved by dock excavations and borings.\r\n\r\nEven Southampton Water and the Solent themselves are nothing but\r\nsubmerged valleys. A well at the Horse Sand Fort—one of the iron\r\nforts which rises out of the sea at Spithead—showed a band of\r\ncompressed vegetable matter, probably an old land-surface, more\r\nthan 50 feet below high-water level, the floor of Eocene strata not\r\nbeing met with till 98 feet below high water was reached. In this\r\ncase, however, the strata below 50 feet seem, from the published\r\ndescription, to be of marine origin.\r\n\r\nThe well at Norman Fort is stated to have penetrated to a depth of\r\n127 feet below the sea before Eocene strata were reached; but in this\r\ncase the lower strata were of marine origin, and the only land animal\r\nrecorded was a jaw of red deer, found apparently between 80 and 90\r\nfeet down. These deep channels may be relics of the very ancient\r\n(Tertiary) Solent River, and were probably arms of the sea till they\r\nwere sufficiently silted up for the lowest submerged forest to grow.\r\n\r\nWe have not yet sufficient data, nor is it necessary to our purpose,\r\nto give a detailed reconstruction of this interesting area during\r\nthe successive stages of elevation and depression. During the time\r\nwhen the lowest of the submerged forests flourished the Isle of Wight\r\nwas connected with the mainland where the Solent now narrows about\r\nYarmouth, and probably for some distance westward. This connexion was\r\nkept up till comparatively recent times, only breaking down finally a\r\nshort time before Caesar’s invasion.\r\n\r\nIn early Neolithic times the ancient Solent Valley had already been\r\ndecapitated by the inroads of the sea west of the Needles, and the\r\nremains of this big valley were occupied by a small river flowing\r\neastward through the middle of the present Solent. In its course it\r\nreceived numerous tributaries on either side. It probably opened out\r\ninto an estuary where it joined Southampton Water, and so continued\r\nto and beyond Spithead, receiving other tributaries from the valleys\r\nnow occupied by Portsmouth Harbour, Langston Harbour and Chichester\r\nHarbour.\r\n\r\nIn time we may be able to make a more complete reconstruction of the\r\nphysical geography of this area for definite dates; but the point now\r\nto be insisted on is that the Isle of Wight was part of the mainland\r\nup to quite recent times, so that its fauna and flora could readily\r\npass backwards and forwards without crossing the sea.\r\n\r\nPerhaps to the geographer or geologist one of the most striking\r\nconfirmations of a recent submergence affecting this part of England\r\nwill be found in the strange series of enclosed harbours extending\r\nfrom Chichester westward to Fareham. These harbours are not each\r\ndistinct and separate; all of them have cross connexions in the form\r\nof shallower channels some four or five miles inland from Spithead.\r\nI have often been asked what is the meaning and origin of these\r\npeculiar harbours, which are not forming or widening now, but rather\r\ntend to silt up.\r\n\r\nThe origin of these harbours is quite easy to understand, if we\r\nadmit the recent sinking of the land, and for this we will presently\r\ngive abundant evidence. On any other hypothesis these inosculating\r\nwaterways must seem hopelessly confused and inexplicable. Sea and\r\nwaves do not erode enclosed basins such as these.\r\n\r\nGranting the submergence, we see that each of these harbours must\r\nonce have been a shallow valley; but this does not account for their\r\nbasin-like shape and their cross connexions. For the reason of\r\nthese peculiar features we must look at the map by the Geological\r\nSurvey showing the superficial deposits. It will then be seen that\r\nall this part of Hampshire shows a widespread sheet of gravel and\r\ngravelly loam which slopes gently seaward and passes below the sea\r\nat Spithead. Northward the gravel rises, and the soft Eocene and\r\nCretaceous strata appear beneath the gravel between tide-marks at\r\nvarious places toward the northern ends of these harbours.\r\n\r\nThe waves of the sea can remove loose gravel as readily as clay,\r\nand we see that on this coast wave-action is practically confined\r\nto the low cliff facing the sea and does not affect the interior\r\nof the harbour. But it is well known to geologists that a sheet of\r\ncoarse angular gravel such as this, notwithstanding its looseness,\r\nis much less readily attacked by a small stream than is a surface of\r\nhard clay or even chalk. Thus plains of Tertiary deposits capped by\r\ngravel, under the action of rain or rivers develop into gravel-capped\r\nplateaus and hills, which fall abruptly into open flat-bottomed\r\nvalleys. The denudation takes place at the edge, where the gravel\r\nrests on the Tertiary strata and numerous springs are given out;\r\nthere is scarcely any denudation in the gravel flat, and unless\r\nthe height of the land is considerable there is no great amount of\r\ndenudation in the flat bottom of the valley.\r\n\r\nThus there is a tendency for the valley to widen out on every side,\r\nwherever the gravel rests on impervious or soft strata. But where\r\nthe gravel plunges below the water-level, as it did at the entrance\r\nto each of these harbours, the valley narrowed, for there were no\r\nlandslips, the drainage was subterranean, and the stream could not\r\nreadily remove the large flints.\r\n\r\nThe widening of the valleys, where they were cut in soft strata, led\r\nto the development of small lateral valleys to the right and left,\r\nleaving only narrow divides between their head waters and those of\r\nthe next valley. When the land sank these divides were flooded, and\r\nso were developed the shallow cross connexions, much as we now see\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIn order that it may not be imagined that this reconstruction is\r\nmerely hypothetical, it will be as well to give some evidence that\r\nsuch an elevation and submergence did take place in this district\r\nas in others. We cannot in this little book deal with the whole\r\nof the evidence, so we will take the Southampton Dock excavations\r\nas sufficient to prove our point, condensing the account from the\r\n_Geology of Southampton_, published by the Geological Survey.\r\n\r\nThe general section at Southampton Docks is as follows, though the\r\nthickness varies considerably at different points, and the greatest\r\ndepth of the old valley has not yet been proved:—\r\n\r\n                                                            Feet\r\n  Estuarine silt                                              20\r\n  Peat, old vegetable soil, or tufaceous marl;\r\n    ox, pig, horse, pine, beech, birch, oak,\r\n    and hazel                                  variable up to 17\r\n  Gravel, with reindeer                               10 or more\r\n\r\nThe bottom gravel is apparently of Pleistocene date, though it\r\nmay include also a basement bed belonging to the newer deposits.\r\nT. W. Shore recorded from the peat above the gravel a fine stone\r\nhammer-head of Neolithic date and worked articles of bone, but no\r\ninstruments of metal were found. The associated marl was full of\r\nfreshwater shells.\r\n\r\nPoole Harbour tells a similar story, and evidence of this submergence\r\nis seen in the various submerged forests found along the Dorset and\r\nDevon coasts, opposite the mouths of the valleys. These rocky coasts\r\nare, however, so different from those we have just been describing,\r\nthat they will more conveniently be treated of in a separate chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nCORNWALL AND THE ATLANTIC COAST\r\n\r\n\r\nOn travelling westward into Cornwall we enter a region which is\r\nextremely critical in any enquiry as to the amount of change that\r\nthe sea-level has undergone. As long as we were dealing with ancient\r\nriver-channels opening into enclosed seas, like the North Sea or\r\nIrish Sea, it might be said that the depth to which the channel\r\nwas cut was not necessarily governed by the sea-level. It might be\r\ngoverned by the level of an alluvial plain, which then extended for\r\nhundreds of miles further, and had its upper edge high above the\r\nsea-level.\r\n\r\nThis cannot be said in Cornwall, for there the sea-bed shelves\r\nrapidly into deep water, and the coast would not be far away, even\r\nwere the land raised 200 feet or 300 feet. The rivers then as now\r\nmust have flowed almost directly into the Atlantic Ocean, and their\r\nchannels must then as now have cut nearly to the sea-level of the\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nThe Cornish rivers yield most valuable information. It so happens\r\nthat many of them bring down large quantities of tin ore from the\r\ngranitic regions, and this ore being very heavy tends to find its way\r\nto the bottom of the alluvial deposits, out of which it is obtained\r\nin the same way as alluvial gold in other countries. On following\r\nthis detrital tin ore downwards towards the estuaries the “tinners”\r\nor alluvial miners found in many cases that a rich layer descended\r\nlower and lower till it passed well below the sea-level in some of\r\nthe ancient silted-up valleys. Some of these tin deposits were so\r\nrich that it paid even to divert the rivers, dam out the sea, and\r\nremove the alluvium to considerable depths in search of the ore.\r\n\r\nThese excavations for tin produced most interesting and continuous\r\nsections of the alluvial deposits, and if only they had been examined\r\nmore thoroughly and scientifically they would have thrown much light\r\non the questions we are here considering. Unfortunately all the\r\ndeeper excavations were made in days when all ideas as to the origin\r\nof “diluvial” deposits were so tinged with theories as to the effects\r\nof a universal deluge, that many of the most interesting points\r\nescaped notice. The last of these “stream works” was closed many\r\nyears ago.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the early date of these excavations, some most\r\ninteresting observations were recorded; and though they make\r\nus long for fuller details and regret the loss of many of the\r\nobjects referred to, we must be grateful that so much was noted,\r\nand by such careful observers. This entire removal of the old\r\nalluvial deposits—for the tin usually occurs concentrated in the\r\nbottom layers—showed clearly that in Cornwall, as elsewhere, old\r\nland-surfaces can be found far below the sea-level. The shape of the\r\nvalley-bottom, and the rapid lessening of its fall as the coast is\r\napproached, in several cases point clearly to the proximity of the\r\nsea, and show that its ancient level must have been about 70 feet\r\nbelow present tides.\r\n\r\nHere it may be pointed out that as the sea-level is approached the\r\nsteady seaward fall of a rocky =V=-shaped valley quickly lessens,\r\nchanges to a gentle slope, and then to a flat, more or less wide\r\naccording to the length of time during which the river has been kept\r\nat the same level, and could only swing from side to side, without\r\ndeepening its bed. In Cornwall there is a definite limit below which\r\nthe erosion of the valleys has not gone, and at this level the valley\r\nwidens and flattens as it does elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe eastern border of Cornwall is formed by the extensive harbour\r\nwhich receives the Tamar, Tavy, and Plym, and this harbour is\r\nobviously nothing but a submerged seaward continuation of the\r\ncombined valleys eroded by these rivers. The rivers, it must be\r\nremembered, though short, receive great part of the drainage of\r\nDartmoor, where the rainfall is excessive; they are therefore\r\nvery liable to floods. These streams also bring down much coarse\r\ngravel and sharp granitic sand, so that their erosive power must be\r\nexceptionally great during floods. It seems therefore that the scour\r\nwould always have been sufficient to keep open a channel well below\r\nlow-water level.\r\n\r\nNo stream tin has been worked in the Plymouth estuary, so that we\r\ncannot point to any continuous sections in the ancient alluvial\r\ndeposits, such as are found further west. These tin deposits,\r\nhowever, date in the main from a period somewhat earlier than that\r\nwith which we are now dealing. They were probably swept down from\r\nDartmoor when floods were far more severe, during the annual spring\r\nmelting of the snow during the Glacial epoch. Unfortunately, also,\r\nthe lately finished harbour works at Devonport proved the existence\r\nof only modern alluvium, without any submerged forests.\r\n\r\nBefore dealing with the rivers which flow into Plymouth Sound it\r\nis necessary, however, to say a few words about the harbour itself\r\nand its origin. Plymouth Sound and the various submerged valleys\r\nwhich open into it illustrate well both the continuity of geological\r\nhistory, and the great difficulties which await us when we deal with\r\nvalley erosion which in part dates far back into Tertiary times.\r\nThe Sound is not merely a submerged continuation of the Pleistocene\r\nvalleys, and between this wide gulf and the narrow valleys there\r\nis a curious want of continuity. We do not know the true depth to\r\nthe rocky floor; but at two places just outside the mouths of the\r\nestuaries deep hollows are scoured through the sands. One of these,\r\njust outside the Hamoaze, or estuary of the Tamar, shows a rocky\r\nbottom at 150 feet, probably the true rock-floor of that part of the\r\nSound. The other hollow, 132 feet, is just outside the Cattewater;\r\nbut does not reach rock.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that these depths, both of which are measured from\r\nlow water, show a depression of the rocky floor of the Sound far\r\ngreater than we meet with in ordinary Pleistocene valleys; but at\r\npresent we have no means of proving the true date of this depression.\r\nIt represents not improbably a Tertiary basin, like that of Bovey\r\nTracey, which also descends several hundred feet below sea-level.\r\nIn favour of this view we can point to the occurrence of a small\r\noutlier of Trias in Cawsand Bay, which certainly suggests that the\r\nSound represents an area of depression or synclinal basin, rather\r\nthan a mere submerged valley. It has also been stated that relics of\r\nTertiary material are still to be found in the limestone quarries of\r\nPlymouth; but for this the evidence is not altogether satisfactory.\r\n\r\nIt may be asked, What practical difference does it make, whether\r\nor no the Plymouth Sound were originally a Tertiary basin, for no\r\nTertiary gulf could now remain open? If we were dealing with an area\r\nof soft rocks, like the Thames Valley, or with an enclosed sea,\r\nthis objection would hold. Around Plymouth, however, the Palaeozoic\r\nrocks are extremely hard, and can resist for ages the attacks of\r\nthe sea; but loose Tertiary material, or even Triassic strata, would\r\nreadily be swept away by the heavy Atlantic swell and by the scour\r\nof the tides, until they were protected by the building of Plymouth\r\nBreakwater.\r\n\r\nThere is a general impression that marine action cannot go on much\r\nbelow low water; but this is altogether a mistake. Tidal scour may\r\ngo on at any depth, provided the current is confined to a narrow\r\nchannel, so as to obtain the requisite velocity. If in addition there\r\nis a to-and-fro motion, such as that caused by the Atlantic swell\r\nat depths of at least 50 fathoms, the actual current required to\r\nremove even coarse sand need only be very gentle. The oscillation\r\nin one direction may not reach the critical velocity; in the other\r\nthis velocity may just be exceeded; the movement, therefore, of the\r\nsand grains may always be in one direction, especially if the courses\r\ntaken by the ebb and flood tides do not coincide, or their velocities\r\ndiffer.\r\n\r\nHow does this apply to the origin of Plymouth Sound? The mere fact\r\nthat opposite the mouth of the Tamar a pit has been scoured to a\r\ndepth of 150 feet, and opposite the Hamoaze another to 132 feet below\r\nlow water, and that these pits are kept open, notwithstanding the\r\nenormous amount of sediment brought down by these rivers, proves that\r\ntidal scour is now going on, or was recently going on, at depths\r\nof 25 fathoms at least in confined parts of Plymouth Sound. Similar\r\ntroughs occur at even greater depths near the Channel Islands, where\r\nthe tidal scour is very great, and in the Bay of Biscay coarse sand\r\nis moved at depths of at least 100 metres.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to make this digression as to the effects of tidal\r\nscour, for we are sometimes told that the various basins, troughs,\r\nand channels shown on the charts represent submerged land-valleys,\r\nand thus prove enormous changes of sea-level in modern times. How\r\na submerged valley in a narrow sea with sandy bottom, like the\r\nEnglish Channel, could remain long without silting up is not clear;\r\nthe sand-banks on either side should tend to wash into and fill up\r\nthe hollows. The troughs, however, all coincide with lines of tidal\r\nscour; they do not continue the lines of existing valleys, unless\r\nthese valleys are so large as to produce a great scour, and unless\r\nthis scour is aided by the oscillation of the waves. A glance at\r\nthe Admiralty chart will show that no submerged channel crosses the\r\ndirection of the tidal scour or of the Atlantic swell; the channels\r\nare scoured where tide and swell act together.\r\n\r\nWe conclude therefore that Plymouth Sound probably represents a basin\r\nonce filled with soft Tertiary and Secondary deposits, and that these\r\nsoft deposits were cleared out by the sea, leaving the rocky floor\r\nof the basin bare at a considerable depth below sea-level. In part\r\nthe basin has now silted up again; but we may fairly consider that at\r\nthe time of greatest elevation, when the submerged valleys were being\r\neroded, the depth of water in the Sound was much the same as it is\r\nnow. Then as now the rivers seem to have discharged into a wide open\r\ngulf occupied by the sea.\r\n\r\nHowever this may be, we see now a series of deeply trenched valleys,\r\npartly submerged and all opening into a wide and deep bay. These\r\nvalleys do not now show rocky bottoms gradually sloping into the open\r\nharbour. The rock floor ceases several miles up and gives place first\r\nto an alluvial flat and then to an arm of the harbour. Like all the\r\nother valleys with which we have been dealing they cut to a definite\r\nbase-level, approximately that of the sea, and the parts below that\r\nlevel are rapidly silting up.\r\n\r\nFortunately a large series of bridge-foundations has shown well the\r\ncharacter of these valleys, where the rocky floor passes beneath\r\nthe sea-level, and the late R. H. Worth gave an excellent series\r\nof sections across them. He took their contours to be evidence of\r\nglaciations. In this I cannot agree with him; but think rather that\r\nthe extraordinary flatness of the valley-bottoms, and especially the\r\nuniform depth to which they were excavated, point to the attainment\r\nof a definite base-level.\r\n\r\nCommencing with the most easterly of the rivers which enter the\r\nSound, we find that the Laira Railway Viaduct, across the Cattewater,\r\nproved a breadth of 212 feet at the centre of the channel, with\r\nthe rock-floor practically level at 87 feet below low water; no\r\nV-shaped valley or gorge was met with. At Saltash the foundations\r\nof the bridge show the depth to the rock-bottom to be 75 feet; but\r\nthe viaduct across the Hamoaze is about three miles higher up the\r\nriver than the Laira Viaduct. The Tavy Viaduct, nearly two miles\r\nfurther from the sea, shows a width of 240 feet of practically level\r\nrocky floor at 67 feet below sea-level. Thus all this evidence is\r\nconsistent with the existence of a series of wide open flat-bottomed\r\nvalleys, now partly submerged, with a fall of about five feet in\r\nthe mile. This is about the fall necessary for even a rapid river\r\nflowing through a flat so full of boulders and coarse gravel as this\r\nmust have been. It must not be forgotten also that this five feet in\r\nthe mile is the general fall of the valley-bottom, not of the water,\r\nand that a river winding from side to side would have about half or\r\none-third of this fall. The slope was probably just sufficient to\r\nkeep the channel clear and let the water escape.\r\n\r\nWe may take it, therefore, that the ancient valleys opening into\r\nPlymouth Harbour cut to about 100 feet below mean tide, as do the\r\nThames and Humber, and that this was the measure of the greatest\r\nelevation of the land in Pleistocene times, for these valleys\r\nopened suddenly into a sea of considerably greater depth. A word of\r\nexplanation is still required as to the meaning of the extremely\r\nflat rock-bottom, for one might have expected more of a =U=-shaped\r\nor =V=-shaped valley, unless the period of stationary sea-level were\r\nvery long.\r\n\r\nOwing to the great rush of water from Dartmoor during floods, and\r\nthe enormous amount of coarse gravel swept down, the erosive power\r\nof these streams is very great. This was greatly exaggerated during\r\nthe Glacial Epoch, to which the formation of the tin-ground and of\r\nthe flat bottom belong. The melting of the snow in spring must have\r\ncaused far more severe floods than we now see, and these floods must\r\nhave brought down large quantities of river-ice heavily charged\r\nwith boulders of hard and angular metamorphic rocks, such as would\r\nerode and trench in a way that does not now happen. Thus as the\r\nriver changed its course or swung from side to side according to the\r\nvarying amount of water, the ice-laden water must have had an erosive\r\npower more like that of a Canadian river in spring than like anything\r\nwe now see in Britain. The wide and deep flat-bottomed trench need\r\nnot have taken any enormous length of time to form, for river-ice and\r\nanchor-ice were constantly at work removing the loose material and\r\nlaying bare the rock-face so that it could be again attacked.\r\n\r\nThe period of exceptionally rapid erosion and of low sea-level above\r\npostulated must be our starting point in Devonshire and Cornwall as\r\nelsewhere, for it fixed the shape and depth of the submerged valleys\r\nover wide areas. This erosion came somewhat earlier than the growth\r\nof the submerged forests; but it is impossible to treat of any\r\nparticular period of history without some mention of what has gone\r\nbefore and led up to it. I may say also that I doubt whether there is\r\nany such great gap as is commonly supposed between the Glacial period\r\nand later times.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the succession of the newer deposits in the submerged\r\nvalleys near Plymouth appears never to have been worked out,\r\nattention having been concentrated on the contour of the rocky floor.\r\nThe recently completed Devonport dock excavations, which I examined,\r\nshowed only very modern alluvium and silted-up channels with logs of\r\nwood cut by metal tools. Submerged forests do not appear to have been\r\nmet with.\r\n\r\nThough Plymouth Harbour has not yielded much information concerning\r\nthe particular period with which we are dealing, it is important\r\nas fixing the maximum amount of elevation to which the land was\r\nsubjected in Pleistocene or more recent times. We will now turn to\r\nthe Cornish stream-tin works, which give more detail as to the later\r\nchanges; we regret however that these most interesting excavations\r\nwere closed so long ago, for various points were noted about which\r\nwe should like further information, and this is not now obtainable.\r\nThe old diluvian hypothesis has much to answer for in the long\r\nneglect of those modern strata which help to tie on geology to\r\narchaeology and history.\r\n\r\nBy far the best account that has come down to us of a Cornish tin\r\nstream-work carried below the sea-level, is that written by J. W.\r\nColenso in 1829. Colenso had unusual opportunities for watching the\r\nworks—apparently either as manager or owner—and he showed a most\r\nexceptional ability to note scientific points, such as were generally\r\noverlooked 90 years ago. It should be remembered that even in days\r\nbefore Lyell wrote we had in the Cornish tinners a class of men\r\nwhose everyday occupations led them thoroughly to understand the\r\naction of running water. Their daily bread depended on their power to\r\ncalculate where the ancient flood must have left the heavy tin-ore,\r\nwhere the barren ground would be found, or where old silted-up\r\nchannels might be sought for. In their arrangements for diverting the\r\nstreams in order to work the alluvial deposits, and for washing and\r\nconcentrating the tin-ore, they were constantly brought face to face\r\nwith the action of running water. When the buried tin-ground yielded\r\nanything abnormal the tinner recognised the effects of exceptional\r\nfloods, of eddies behind boulders, or of obstructing ledges. Where\r\nhe thought he saw the action of the deluge we may be pretty certain\r\nthat he was dealing with something truly exceptional and outside his\r\nexperience of the effects of a mountain torrent. He was not using the\r\nword as a cloak for ignorance or excuse for indifference, as was so\r\noften the case with the geologist of that day. Unfortunately most of\r\nthe tinners could not write.\r\n\r\nColenso’s account is entitled _A Description of Happy Union Tin\r\nStream-work at Pentuan_. Pentuan lies at the mouth of the St Austell\r\nRiver, a rapid stream, much liable to sudden floods, which drains\r\npart of the granite and metalliferous region of St Austell Moor.\r\nThe conditions are ideal for bringing down large quantities of\r\nthe decayed granite which contains the tin-ore. This material was\r\nalternately weathered and broken up, and so sluiced with flood-water\r\nas to wash away the lighter quartz and felspar, thus concentrating\r\nthe tin-ore, with a small amount of gold-dust and small gold nuggets,\r\nin the bottom layer.\r\n\r\nThe alluvium of the St Austell River was therefore so profitable to\r\nwork that every channel was followed upwards into the Moor, and the\r\nmain valley was followed downward towards the sea. But as the coast\r\nwas approached the rocky floor sank below the sea-level, so that this\r\npart was left till last, for it needed the diversion of the river\r\nand much pumping to get rid of the water. This, scientifically, is\r\na fortunate circumstance, for of the earlier workings in the higher\r\npart of the valley no good accounts have come down to us.\r\n\r\nThe river is only a small one and its catchment area is very limited;\r\nit has therefore a rapid fall, amounting to 30 feet in the mile\r\nbetween St Austell and the sea. With this fall the valley is still\r\nsilting up and its alluvium rising, principally through the abnormal\r\namount of sediment and granitic sand sent down by the china-clay\r\nworks. If we take the fall of the buried channel, this amounts to\r\nabout 45 feet to the mile, for the rock-floor at Pentuan lies about\r\n60 feet below the sea-level. This rock-floor is composed of hard\r\nslates.\r\n\r\nThe successive deposits met with above the slate were as follows,\r\ncommencing with the lowest:—\r\n\r\n(_a_) _The tin ground_, or stratum in which the whole of the\r\nstream-tin is found. It lies on the solid rock and is generally from\r\nthree to six feet thick, sometimes even ten feet. It extends across\r\nthe valley, except where turned by a projecting hill or rock, when\r\nit is found to take the supposed ancient course of the river, which\r\nis generally under the steep bank opposite. This last observation\r\n(often made by tinners) is important, for it suggests that the\r\nheavy tin-ore was brought down by exceptional floods, such as would\r\nswing violently to the outer side of the curve, and there cut a\r\nsteep bluff, under which would be left the heaviest gravel. This\r\nobservation and the noteworthy absence of any contemporaneous animal\r\nremains in the tin-ground, suggest that the bottom layer may date\r\nback to Pleistocene times, when the climate was colder and floods\r\nmore violent.\r\n\r\nIt is not clear how far seaward the valley may then have extended;\r\nprobably not more than half a mile at most. The tin ground was\r\nworked near Pentuan for 1400 yards along the valley, and averaged\r\nabout 52 yards in breadth. So here again we meet with a fairly wide\r\nflat-bottomed valley, not a narrow =V=-shaped gorge; we may therefore\r\ntake it that the base-level had been reached and that this base-level\r\nwas identical with that met with in the rivers which open into\r\nPlymouth Sound.\r\n\r\n(_b_) On the tin ground were rooted numerous oaks, which had grown\r\nand fallen on the spot. Their timber was so sound that Colenso\r\napplied one of the trees to make the axle of a water-wheel, and his\r\ncomment on this is excellent. “It appears to me likely that at this\r\nperiod, the rising of the sea had so far checked the current of the\r\nriver as to prevent its discharging the mud and sand brought down\r\nwith it; thus the roots were buried [submerged?] to a considerable\r\ndepth, and the trees killed, before the timber underwent its natural\r\nprocess of decay.” At one spot he records finding oysters still\r\nremaining fastened to some of the larger stones at the top of the\r\ntin ground and to the stumps of the oaks.\r\n\r\nThen comes a stratum of dark silt, about 12 inches thick, with\r\ndecomposed vegetable matter, and on this a layer of leaves of trees,\r\nhazel nuts, sticks and moss for 6 or 12 inches more. This layer of\r\nvegetable matter is about 30 feet below the level of the sea at\r\nlow-water and about 48 feet at spring tides. It extends with some\r\ninterruption across the valley.\r\n\r\nThe point is not made quite clear in Colenso’s account, but\r\napparently there is no marine deposit between the “tin ground” and\r\nthe peat, the oyster-bed above mentioned representing the base of bed\r\n_c_, which at that point has cut through the peat, so as to lay bare\r\npart of the gravel and some of the oak-stumps rooted in it. So far,\r\nwherever we have a carefully noted section of the lowest deposits in\r\nthese valleys, the tin ground or the gravels are directly succeeded\r\nby a growth of oak trees. It looks as though the climate ameliorated,\r\nthe more violent floods ceased, and an oak forest grew across the\r\nalluvial flats, without there being any, or much, change of sea-level.\r\n\r\n(_c_) Above the vegetable matter and leaves (_b_) was found a\r\n“stratum of sludge or silt” 10 feet in thickness. It showed little\r\nvariation except from a brownish to a lead colour. “The whole is\r\nsprinkled with recent shells, together with wood, hazel nuts,\r\nand sometimes the bones and horns of deer, oxen, etc. The shells,\r\nparticularly the flat ones, are frequently found in rows or layers;\r\nthey are often double or closed, with their opening part upwards.”\r\nFrom Colenso’s account it seems probable that this bed was a marine\r\nsilt with _Scrobicularia_ and cockles in the position of life. He\r\ngoes on to say that “There has been recently found imbedded in the\r\nsilt, about two feet from the top, a piece of oak, that had been\r\nbrought into form by the hand of man; it is about six feet long, one\r\ninch and a half broad, and less than half an inch thick; this is the\r\ngreatest depth at which I have ever seen any converted substance.\r\nIt appears to have floated in the sea, as at one end, which is much\r\ndecayed, a small barnacle has fixed its habitation.”\r\n\r\n(_d_) _A stratum of sea-sand_, about four inches in thickness; this\r\nis easily distinguished from the river-sand, being much finer, and\r\nhaving always more or less shells mixed with it.\r\n\r\n(_e_) _Silt_ two feet, with concretions containing wood and bones.\r\n\r\n(_f_) _Another stratum of sea-sand_, 20 feet in thickness. In all\r\nparts of this sand there are timber trees, chiefly oaks, lying in all\r\ndirections; also remains of animals such as red deer, “heads of oxen\r\nof a different description from any now known in Britain, the horns\r\nof which all turn downwards.” Human skulls were also found near the\r\nbottom of the sand, and one of these with other fossils was presented\r\nby Colenso to the Royal Geological Society of Cornwall. In the upper\r\npart of this sand nearer the mouth of the harbour, the bones of a\r\nlarge whale were found. The sea at this time seems to have extended\r\nabout a mile up the valley.\r\n\r\n(_g_) _A bed of rough river-sand and gravel, here and there mixed\r\nwith sea-sand and silt._ About 20 feet in thickness. In this sand\r\nwas found “the remains of a row of wooden piles, sharpened for the\r\npurpose of driving, which appear to have been used for forming a\r\nwooden bridge for foot passengers: they crossed the valley, and were\r\nabout six feet long; their tops being about 24 feet from the present\r\nsurface—just on a level with the present low water at spring tides.\r\nHad the sea-level been then as now, such a bridge would have been\r\nnearly useless.”\r\n\r\nAt Wheal Virgin, which was the upward extension of the Happy Union\r\nworks, about a mile higher up the valley than the bridge just\r\nmentioned, the tin ground was only 32 feet from the surface. Here\r\nColenso mentions seeing “on the surface of the tin-ground two small\r\npieces of oak, with artificial holes in them: and there were near\r\nthem several oak stakes, sharpened and driven into the ground, and\r\nsupported by large stones. Near the same spot has been found a\r\nsubstance resembling the ashes of charcoal.” This account suggests a\r\nfish or otter trap of some sort and the charcoal below the sea-level\r\nsuggests that it must date back to at least as early a period as the\r\nsubmerged bridge. It is a great pity that antiquaries were not at\r\nthat period more alive to the great interest of these finds.\r\n\r\nCarnon stream-works, on a navigable branch of the Fal, showed a very\r\nsimilar section, for below about 54 feet of alternating sand and silt\r\nwas found, according to Henwood, a bed one and a half feet thick of\r\nwood, moss, leaves, nuts, etc., a few oyster shells, remains of deer\r\nand other mammals, and some human skulls. Below this came the tin\r\nground varying in thickness from a few inches to 12 feet. Here also\r\nno organic remains were found in the tin ground itself.\r\n\r\nThe above records may be accepted as giving fair samples of the\r\ndeposits which now fill the lower parts of the submerged valleys\r\nof Devon and Cornwall. These valleys were all at one time long\r\ncreeks or arms of the sea, navigable for a considerable distance\r\ninland and affording a fine series of sheltered harbours at short\r\ndistances apart. A few of these harbours were so deep and large that\r\nthey have not yet been obliterated, as is seen in the case of the\r\nDart, the branches of Plymouth Harbour, the Fal, the Gannel, etc.\r\nA rapid silting-up is, however, now going on, greatly aided by the\r\nrefuse from the mines and china-clay works. In the days whilst the\r\nsubsidence was in progress Cornwall was essentially a country of\r\nfjords, though now good harbours are few or blocked with sand-banks.\r\n\r\nThe abundance of sheltered creeks must have had considerable\r\ninfluence on the manner of living of the inhabitants; but it is\r\nnoticeable that though many acres of the silts have been removed in\r\ntinning, and a good many human remains have been found, there is no\r\nmention of boats. This absence of any record of boats in any of the\r\nmarine silts associated with or below submerged forests cannot be\r\nan accident; for old boats and dug-out canoes are constantly being\r\ndiscovered in later alluvial and fen deposits. It looks as if in\r\nthose early days man had either no boats, or only used coracles of\r\nskin and wicker, such as would entirely decay and leave no trace.\r\n\r\nIt may be remarked that the higher submerged forest, that lying just\r\nabout low-water level, is not recorded in the deep excavations at\r\nPentuan and Carnon, though these old land-surfaces are so conspicuous\r\non the foreshore opposite every smaller creek, when the sea happens\r\nto scour away the sand and beach. A little consideration will show\r\nthe reason of this difference. The extensive stream-works of Pentuan\r\nand Carnon happen to lie at the mouths of two of the larger and\r\ndeeper creeks, in which silting-up could not keep pace with the\r\nsubsidence. Thus the seaward ends were continuously occupied by\r\nsea, from the time when the oak-forest sank right on into historic\r\ntimes, and over this deeply buried oak-forest we only find alternate\r\nlayers of silt and sea-sand. Evidence of the later submerged forest,\r\nhowever, is not entirely wanting, for the submerged wooden bridge or\r\ncauseway of Pentuan must belong to the period when the trees seen on\r\nthe foreshore elsewhere were flourishing well above high-water mark.\r\n\r\nThe submerged forests seen on the foreshore in western Cornwall are\r\nso like those exposed elsewhere that there is no need for a full\r\ndescription, were it not that they have become so connected with\r\nancient legends of Lost Lyonesse, a country which is supposed to have\r\njoined the Land’s End to the Isles of Scilly somewhere about the date\r\nof King Arthur and Merlin. To what extent these stories are due to\r\nobservation of the submerged forests and of the rapid waste of land\r\nin Mount’s Bay, supplemented by a vivid Celtic imagination, which saw\r\n“the tops of houses through the clear water,” is doubtful. Legend may\r\nassist, as is shown in a later chapter (p. 120). One thing is clear,\r\nthe alluvial flat of Mount’s Bay, under which the submerged forest\r\nlies, formerly extended much further seaward; and old writers mention\r\nthe tradition that St Michael’s Mount formerly rose as an isolated\r\nrock in a wood. As far as can be calculated from its known rate\r\nof encroachment, the sea cannot have reached the Mount till long\r\nafter the Roman period, and the legend is probably quite accurate.\r\nThe Mount was surrounded by a wide marshy flat covered with alders\r\nand willows till well within the historic period; the contradictory\r\nstory, that the Phoenician traded to St Michael’s Mount for tin seems\r\nto be the invention of a sixteenth-century antiquary.\r\n\r\nIn Mount’s Bay there has been subsidence as well as loss of land\r\nthrough the attacks of the sea, for beneath the alluvial plain, part\r\nof which is still seen in Marazion Marsh, is buried a submerged\r\nforest. Stumps of large oaks, as well as roots of hazel and sallow,\r\nare to be seen at various points on the foreshore, where the\r\noverlying alluvium and peat have been cleared away by the sea. But\r\nthe oak-stumps seem to be rooted on a soil resting directly on solid\r\nrock; they do not appear to be underlain by estuarine deposits, or by\r\nlower submerged forests. This particular land-surface may therefore\r\nrepresent a long period of gradual sinking, during which the trees\r\nflourished continuously, and first at a considerable elevation above\r\nthe sea.\r\n\r\nThe deposit would repay closer examination, for it was not well\r\nexposed while I was staying in Cornwall. I could find no trace of man\r\nin it at Penzance, and the contained flora was principally noticeable\r\nfor its poverty and the entire absence of any of the characteristic\r\nwest-country plants. The trees were the oak, hazel, and sallow,\r\nthe seeds obtained belong to the lesser spearwort, blackberry, a\r\npotentil, self-heal, and some sedges.\r\n\r\nCarne, however, in 1846 was more successful at the eastern end of the\r\nBay, for he has handed down to us an account of the strata met with\r\nin a mine-shaft on Marazion Marsh. The height of the ground at this\r\nspot is only about 12 feet above mean-tide level, and as the deposits\r\npenetrated are 32 feet thick, it is clear that both the rocky floor\r\nand the lower peat must lie beneath the level of the lowest spring\r\ntide. The position of the shaft was close to the Marazion River,\r\nwhere we would expect also to find an ancient buried channel. The\r\nupper deposits may be of very modern date. Commencing at the top the\r\nsuccession met with was:—\r\n\r\n                                                             Feet\r\n\r\n                       Slime, gravel and loose ground         8\r\n  Recent estuarine   { Rather soft peat                       4\r\n    deposits         { White sand with cockles               12\r\n        Recent       { Layer of trees, principally\r\n          or         {   oak and hazel, all prostrate.\r\n       Neolithic     {   One piece of oak, about 14 feet\r\n                     {   long, appears to have been wrought,\r\n                     {   as if it had been intended for the\r\n                     {   keel of a boat                    1 to 2\r\n      “Submerged     { Hard solid peat, of closer texture\r\n        forest”      {   than the upper bed                     3\r\n                       Alluvial gravel with tin-ore             4\r\n                                                               —\r\n                       Slaty floor                          at 32\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that the supposed keel of a boat occurs above\r\nthe old land-surface, among driftwood which probably belongs to the\r\nfirst infilling of the estuary after the submergence took place. The\r\nupper peat is probably nothing but the surface of the modern marsh,\r\nsmothered and much compressed by the eight feet of “loose ground” or\r\nrefuse from the neighbouring mines which had accumulated above it.\r\nThe cockles probably flourished at the same level (about low-water\r\nmark) as that at which they are now found.\r\n\r\nIt is not our intention here to deal in any detail with the submerged\r\nland-surfaces noticed on the French coast opposite. The Channel\r\nIslands yield indications of submergence, and if its amount was as\r\ngreat as that proved on the north shores of the Channel, then the\r\nChannel Islands must have been connected with the mainland up to a\r\nperiod when the climatic conditions were similar to and the fauna and\r\nflora resembled those of the adjoining parts of France at the present\r\nday.\r\n\r\nFurther west, recent discoveries on the shores of the Bay of Biscay\r\nare of considerable interest, for submerged forests occur at various\r\nplaces, though the maximum amount of the submergence has not yet been\r\nsatisfactorily made out.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting of the submerged forests seen between\r\ntide-marks on the French coast was that discovered a few years\r\nsince by Monsieur Emil Gadeceau in Belle Ile. This island lies off\r\nthe mouth of the Loire, and its position some way from the coast and\r\nwell out in the Atlantic induced him to make a special study of its\r\nflora. While engaged in this, his attention was drawn to certain hard\r\npeaty deposits seen only at low tide, and he asked me to undertake\r\nthe examination of the seeds found in them. This work was gladly\r\nundertaken, as it carried further south the examination which was\r\nthen being made into the flora of the submerged forests.\r\n\r\nThe results were somewhat surprising; out of about 30 species\r\nsufficiently well preserved for identification, six were no longer\r\nliving in Belle Ile, though known in Western France. The whole\r\nflora might have come from the north of England, characteristic\r\nFrench species being entirely missing, though this element is fairly\r\nrepresented in the living flora of the island. In short, the flora\r\nis a northern one, though in no degree arctic, and in this it agrees\r\nwell with the poor assemblage commonly found in the submerged forests\r\nof the south of England.\r\n\r\nFrom still further south, at various points on the shores of the Bay\r\nof Biscay, and from the submerged peaty deposits which underlie the\r\nLandes, seeds have since been collected by my friend, Professor Jules\r\nWelsch, of Poitiers. These also all belong to common living British\r\nplants, except that at Brétignolles, south of latitude 47°, we\r\nmeet for the first time one characteristic southern plant—the vine.\r\nUnfortunately the search for traces of man and his works in these\r\ndeposits has so far been unsuccessful, and we cannot yet be certain\r\ntherefore that they are all of quite the same date, or correspond\r\nexactly with the submerged forests of Britain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nSUMMARY\r\n\r\n\r\nTo what conclusions do the foregoing somewhat monotonous pages lead?\r\nDo they help us to explain the origin of our fauna and flora? What\r\nlight do they throw on the antiquity of man in Britain, or on the\r\nrace problems that everywhere confront us? Can the deposits therein\r\ndescribed be in any way connected with written history or with\r\nlegend? Do they give us any approach to a measure of geological time?\r\nAnd, to what extent does the period of the submerged forests tie on\r\nhistorical times with the Glacial Epoch?\r\n\r\nAll these questions are connected with the subject-matter of this\r\nlittle book; but it is not written with the idea of showing how much\r\nwe know or pretend to know. Our main object is to draw attention\r\nto a much neglected period in geological history and to suggest\r\ndirections in which further research is likely to be profitable. We\r\nhave, however, made out several points, and can give an approximate\r\nanswer to some of the questions.\r\n\r\nIt is quite clear that at the opening of the period with which\r\nthis volume deals, the greater part of England stood fully 70 feet\r\nabove its present level, for the oldest deposit we deal with is\r\na land-surface covered with oak-forest and lying 60 feet below\r\ntide-level. The oaks cannot have flourished lower, but they may have\r\ngrown on a soil well above sea-level. Perhaps taking the whole of the\r\nevidence into account, a subsidence of nearly 90 feet is the most\r\nprobable measure of the extent of the subsequent movement.\r\n\r\nWe do not yet know whether in England this movement was a depression\r\nof the land or a rise of the sea; but the fact that the relative\r\nlevels seem to have been quite different in Scotland and in\r\nScandinavia seems to indicate that it was the land that moved, not\r\nthe sea.\r\n\r\nWe begin, therefore, with a period when the whole of the southern\r\npart of the North Sea was an alluvial flat connecting Britain with\r\nHolland and Denmark, and to some extent with France. The Isle of\r\nWight was connected with Hampshire, and the Channel Islands with\r\nFrance. Probably the Isles of Scilly were islands even then, for the\r\nchannel between them and Cornwall is both deep and wide, though this\r\nmay possibly be due to tidal scour.\r\n\r\nThe animals and plants yet known from this lowest submerged forest\r\nare disappointingly few; but the prevalence of the oak shows that\r\nthe climate was mild, and that we have no clear indication of\r\nconditions approaching to those of the Glacial Epoch. In fact, in all\r\nthe submerged forests the fauna and flora seem poor and monotonous,\r\nconsisting essentially of living British species, with a few mammals\r\nsince locally exterminated by man, and all known to have a wide range\r\nboth in climate and latitude.\r\n\r\nThis in itself, however, is a point gained in the study of the\r\norigin of our flora; for though the deficiency is no doubt largely\r\ndue to insufficient collecting, I am convinced that it is a true\r\ncharacteristic of this period of transition. Much time has been spent\r\nin examining and collecting the fossils of these submerged forests,\r\nand various friends have also worked at them; but everywhere we seem\r\nto get the same result, and many abandon the study because there\r\nis so little to show for it. The deposits certainly contain a much\r\npoorer fauna and flora than either the Pleistocene or the recent\r\nalluvial strata.\r\n\r\nIf we consider the Britain of the submerged forests as having\r\nlately emerged from a time when the climate was ungenial, we should\r\nnaturally expect to find among the first incomers after the change\r\nonly such animals and plants as have a wide climatic range or can\r\nmigrate freely. It is these species, and these only, which will be\r\nliving on the neighbouring lands; it is only an assemblage like\r\nthis that can stand the climatic alternations and relapses that are\r\nlikely to attend the transition. An assemblage consisting only of\r\nspecies widely distributed in latitude is probably an assemblage that\r\nhas special means of dispersal—even if we do not happen yet to have\r\ndiscovered these means.\r\n\r\nThese considerations should lead us to expect to find living, in any\r\ncountry which has lately undergone a change of climate, a somewhat\r\npeculiar assemblage, consisting mainly of hardy forms of wide range\r\nin latitude, and not characteristically either northern or southern.\r\nMingled with them, we might expect a few survivors from the previous\r\nwarm or cold period. A hardy fauna and flora seem to characterise the\r\nperiod of the submerged forests; but the absence or great scarcity of\r\ncharacteristic survivors from a former period suggests that even the\r\nlowest of these deposits is far removed from the Glacial Epoch. The\r\narctic species had already had time to die out, or had been crowded\r\nout; but the time had not been sufficiently long for the incoming\r\nof the southern forms which now characterise our southern counties.\r\nThen, even less than now, had we reached a perfect adjustment of the\r\nfauna and flora to the climatic conditions; this can only be brought\r\nabout by a constant invasion of species from all the surrounding\r\nregions. Some hold their own, most cannot; but as time goes on, the\r\nsurviving assemblage consists more and more of species which have\r\nbeen able to fight against the severe competition and colonize a new\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nGarden experiments are of little use as tests of the capability of\r\nany plant to survive in this country; the study of cornfield weeds\r\nis no better. In both cases the cultivation of the land produces a\r\nbare place on which a foreign introduction has as good a chance as\r\na native. But could this foreigner survive if the seed were dropped\r\non a natural moor or meadow? In this connexion it is noticeable that\r\ngreat part of the rare British plants occur close to the coast,\r\nopposite the part of the continent in which they are found, though\r\nthey are not maritime species. This is probably due to two different\r\ncauses, both acting in the same direction. In the first place most\r\nof these local plants are obviously late comers, which have not yet\r\nhad time to spread inland or far. And, secondly, on the coast alone\r\ndo we find any considerable extent of natural bare land—practically\r\ngarden land—which does not at the same time consist of poor soil.\r\nThe tumbled undercliffs of our coast are just the places to give a\r\nforeign invader a chance; there only will it find patches of bare\r\ngood soil, full of small cracks in which a seed is hidden from birds.\r\n\r\nIf the view is correct, that a continuous growth of our flora, and\r\nto some extent of our fauna, takes place through transportation to\r\nour coasts, from which such species as can fight their way tend\r\nmore slowly to spread inland, it seems to account for the present\r\ncurious distribution of species, and this in a way that no continuous\r\nland-connexion will do.\r\n\r\nAs we have pointed out in a former chapter, the land-connexion across\r\nthe North Sea was a wide alluvial plain and swampy delta. What use\r\ncould dry-soil plants make of such a bridge? It would be no easier\r\nfor them to cross than so much sea; and migrating mammals could\r\nnot greatly help in the dispersal, where so many rivers had to be\r\ncrossed. The aquatic species would be helped by such a connexion, and\r\nit is curious to note that several of our most interesting aquatic\r\nplants are confined to the eastern counties, which in post-glacial\r\ntimes had direct connexion with the delta of the Rhine, and probably\r\nwith the Elbe.\r\n\r\nAquatic species, however, are not dependent on continuous waterways\r\nfor their dispersal; they have great facilities for overleaping\r\nbarriers and reaching isolated river-basins and lakes. Every dew-pond\r\non the downs after a few years’ existence contains aquatic plants and\r\nmollusca, and a still larger number of species, including fish, will\r\nbe found in ancient flooded quarries or prehistoric dykes surrounding\r\nsome hill-fortification. If an aquatic plant is fairly common on the\r\ncontinent near by, it is almost certain to occur in some isolated\r\npond or river in the part of Britain opposite.\r\n\r\nMany of our peculiar mollusca and plants are limestone species,\r\nwhich must have crossed over at a single leap, for no elevation or\r\ndepression will connect the various isolated limestone masses of\r\nBritain. A post-glacial elevation would connect the North Downs with\r\nthe corresponding chalk-hills of France; but these Downs are isolated\r\nby wide tracts of non-calcareous strata from the areas of Oolite\r\nor Carboniferous limestone to which many of our limestone animals\r\nand plants are now confined. There is also nothing in the present\r\ndistribution of our limestone species to suggest that any great\r\nstream of migrants used this bridge of chalk-downs.\r\n\r\nIt may be asked, Why discuss these questions here, if all these\r\npeculiar species are unknown in the submerged forests? In certain\r\ncases negative evidence is of great value, and the deficient flora\r\nof the submerged forests is a case in point. We find a striking\r\ncontrast between this ancient flora and the flora which flourished\r\nwhen cultivation of the land had begun. The Roman deposits in Britain\r\nyield many species which have not yet been found in the submerged\r\nforests, and even the earlier Celtic deposits have already yielded a\r\nfew of them. To a large extent this difference is due to the agency\r\nof man, intentional to a certain extent, but mainly accidental,\r\nthrough the introduction of weeds and the preparation of the soil\r\nfor crops. It must not be forgotten that man not only introduced the\r\nweeds, he prepared the land on which they could establish themselves,\r\nand from thence spread to uncultivated ground where few botanists now\r\nsuspect that they are anything but “native.”\r\n\r\nIn days when the people of Britain were hunters, the only extensive\r\nopen country in the south and east seems to have been the chalk-downs\r\nand the sandy heaths. These were not suitable for new additions to\r\nthe plant population, for the good land was all oak forest, the\r\nbarren heaths were unfavourable for any but heath plants, and the\r\nalluvial flats were largely covered with sallow and alder. The open\r\ndowns were clothed with close turf, and until this was broken by\r\ncultivation there would be little chance for migrants. It seems,\r\ntherefore, that to obtain a clear idea of the plant population of\r\nthis country before man’s influence could be felt, we must study\r\nthe flora of the submerged forests and of the associated alluvial\r\ndetritus washed from the uplands during the same period. Till this is\r\ndone more thoroughly, it is not much use to discuss what species are\r\n“native” and what “introduced”; the submerged forest will yield the\r\nanswer to this question.\r\n\r\nThe next question we have put—What light do these submerged forests\r\nthrow on the antiquity of man in Britain, or on the race-problems of\r\nBritain?—is a difficult one to answer in the present state of our\r\nknowledge. Valuable evidence has been lost through the failure to\r\npreserve most of the human remains that have been found; but both\r\nOwen and Huxley recognised the peculiar type of the “river-drift\r\nman.” Unfortunately few implements have been collected, and the\r\npieces of wood shaped by man, though recorded, have not been\r\npreserved. One implement of polished stone has certainly been found\r\nin the latest submerged land-surface, but it is not clear that\r\nanything except flakes has been obtained in the older deposits.\r\nStill the stratigraphical relations seem to indicate that all these\r\ndeposits are of Neolithic age and later than the Palaeolithic\r\nterraces. The relations of Palaeolithic to Neolithic are still very\r\nobscure in this country, and the reason is perhaps to be sought in a\r\nsubmergence which has tended to carry many of the transition deposits\r\nbeneath the sea-level, or has caused them to be silted up under more\r\nmodern alluvium. The lowest submerged forest requires careful search\r\nbefore we can be certain of its true position in the sequence; but\r\nit is seldom exposed, and then only in dock-excavations soon again\r\nhidden.\r\n\r\nBefore we can attempt to answer the other questions, it is important\r\nto get an estimate of the amount of time occupied in the formation\r\nof these deposits, and of the lapse of time since the last of\r\nthem was formed. The newest of them belongs certainly to the age\r\nof polished stone, and the earliest also probably comes within\r\nthe Neolithic period. We have already seen that within the period\r\nrepresented by the submerged forests there has been a rise of the\r\nsea-level, or depression of the land, to the extent of 80 feet,\r\nperhaps a few feet more. If we can obtain some measure of the time\r\noccupied in the formation of such a series of deposits, this should\r\ngive us some idea as to the length of the Neolithic period, and also\r\nof the rate at which changes of the sea-level sometimes can take\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nIt is unfortunate that for these calculations so many of the factors\r\nare of uncertain value. We may estimate from the present rate\r\nof erosion of the coast the amount that has been lost since the\r\nsea-level became stationary, or we may take the rate of accumulation\r\nof sand-dunes or shingle-spits; or the rate at which our estuaries,\r\nharbours, and broads are silting up. It all comes, however, to\r\nthis—no exact figures can be given; but so many rough calculations\r\nlead to approximately the same date, that the date arrived at may\r\nbe trusted to give some idea of the length of the period which has\r\nelapsed since the downward movement ceased.\r\n\r\nWorking backwards from the present day, step by step, archaeological\r\nevidence gives an undoubted period of 2000 years, to the first\r\ncentury B.C., during which no measurable change of sea-level has\r\ntaken place in the south of England.\r\n\r\nTo this must be added a few centuries for the growth of the marshes\r\non which Glastonbury and similar lake-dwellings were built, and\r\nfor the growth of various other marshes at present sea-level known\r\nto be earlier than the Roman invasion. Also we must allow for the\r\naccumulation of various shingle-spits and sand-dunes then already\r\npartly formed.\r\n\r\nIn general, somewhere about one-third or one-half of this\r\naccumulation seems to have taken place before the Roman invasion.\r\nThis adds another 1500 years; so that about 3500 years ago, we get\r\nback to the beginning of the period of unchanging sea-level in which\r\nwe are still living, and begin to see evidence of earth movements\r\nstill in progress.\r\n\r\nWhether this 3500 years will take us back to the beginning of the\r\nBronze Age in Britain is not yet proved; but so far we seem to\r\ndiscover metals in the whole of the deposits formed whilst the\r\nsea-level remained unchanged, and only stone weapons in even the\r\nnewest of the submerged forests. For the present, we may therefore\r\ntake it that the two changes nearly coincided. The use of metals\r\nbegan in Britain about the time that the earth-movements ceased—that\r\nis to say somewhere about 1600 B.C.\r\n\r\nWhether this period of 3500 years will really take us back to the\r\ncommencement of the Bronze Age is doubtful, for Stonehenge had\r\nalready been built, and though only stone hammers seem to have been\r\nthere used, yet one slight streak of bronze or copper has been\r\nnoticed. Of course, there may have been a similar occasional use of\r\nbronze at the time of the last submerged forest; but we have as yet\r\nno evidence of this, and the possible correspondence in date between\r\nStonehenge and the last of the submerged forests remains merely a\r\nsuggestion.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we may still find submerged stone-circles or other\r\nantiquities of the age of Stonehenge beneath the sea-level; but\r\nStonehenge lies too high above the sea for it in itself to give any\r\nclue as to a change of sea-level. We will only make one suggestion.\r\nIt is probable that when Stonehenge was built, a long arm of the\r\nsea extended far up the Avon Valley, so that navigable water was\r\nfound not far from Stonehenge. There is in Stonehenge an inner\r\ncircle of smaller stones, not composed of the local greywethers but\r\nconsisting of large blocks of igneous rock of foreign origin. These\r\nblocks, which are sufficiently large to be awkward for land-carriage,\r\nhave been said to be erratics gathered on Salisbury Plain, just as\r\nthe greywethers for the main circle were gathered; but there are\r\nno erratics on Salisbury Plain. Large erratic blocks of similar\r\ncharacter occur, however, abundantly on the lowlands of Selsey Bill,\r\nunder the lee of the Isle of Wight. Probably a similar erratic-strewn\r\nplain once fringed the coast on the west also, though on the exposed\r\nside the part above the sea-level has now been entirely swept away by\r\nthe sea.\r\n\r\nI would suggest that the Stonehenge erratics, instead of being\r\nbrought from any great distance, may have come from a wide plain at\r\nthe mouth of the Avon, then two or three miles further seaward. From\r\nthence they were rafted far up the navigable fjord, not yet silted\r\nup, and were only carried a short distance uphill. Igneous rocks such\r\nas these, found in a country consisting essentially of chalk and\r\nTertiary strata, would be valuable and probably endowed with magic\r\nproperties, hence their employment in this inner circle.\r\n\r\nOur next enquiry must be into the length of time represented by\r\nthe series of submerged forests and associated deposits described\r\nin the foregoing pages. The newest of them belongs certainly to\r\nthe age of polished stone, and the earliest also probably comes\r\nwithin the Neolithic Period. Within the period represented by the\r\nsubmerged forests, we have seen that there has been a change of the\r\nsea-level to the extent of 80 feet, or perhaps rather more. If we can\r\nobtain some measure of the time occupied, this should give us some\r\napproximate idea as to the length of the Neolithic period, and of\r\nthe rate at which changes of the sea-level can take place.\r\n\r\nThe first point to be considered is the length of time occupied by\r\nthe growth of the series of submerged forests. On first examining,\r\nor reading accounts of, deposits of this sort one obtains a vague\r\nimpression of long periods, during which mighty oaks flourished.\r\nBoth the movements of submergence and the intervening periods of\r\nvegetable growth seem to require great lapses of time. On closer\r\nstudy, however, the evidence seems scarcely to support this view,\r\nfor estuarine silts are deposits of exceptionally rapid growth, and\r\none finds that the usual characteristic of a “submerged forest” is\r\nthat it shows indications of only a single generation of trees. The\r\ntrees also are usually small, except where the submerged forest rests\r\ndirectly on deposits of much earlier date, or on solid rock.\r\n\r\nIt should be remembered that the large oak trees which are often\r\nfound in the lowest land-surface at any particular place do not\r\nnecessarily belong to any one special stage of the submergence.\r\nThese same trees may have grown continuously above tide-marks\r\nduring several successive stages, until at last the upward creeping\r\nwater rose sufficiently to reach this part of the forest. The large\r\nwell-grown oaks seen in Mount’s Bay and various other places are, as\r\nfar as I have seen, all rooted on ancient gravels, solid rock, or\r\nboulder clay, not on beds of silt.\r\n\r\nWe cannot speak confidently as to the time needed to form each thin\r\nlayer of vegetable soil, marsh peat, or estuarine silt. On comparing\r\nthe submerged land-surfaces, however, with similar accumulations\r\nformed within known periods, such as marsh soils grown behind ancient\r\nembankments, or forest-growth over flats silted up at known dates,\r\nwe can learn something. No one of the land-surfaces alternating with\r\nthe silts would necessarily require more than a century or two for\r\nits formation. Brushwood and swamp growth are the characteristic\r\nfeatures of these deposits, and such growth accumulates and decays\r\nvery rapidly. Possibly trees of older growth may still be found, but\r\nI have not succeeded in discovering a tree more than a century old in\r\nany one of the marsh deposits alternating with the estuarine silts.\r\nOaks of three centuries may be observed rooted in the older deposits;\r\nbut this, as above explained, is another matter.\r\n\r\nIt is useless to pretend to any exact calculations as to the time\r\nneeded for the formation of these alternating strata of estuarine\r\nsilt and marsh-soil; but looking at the whole of the evidence without\r\nbias either way, it seems that an allowance of 1000, or at most\r\n1500, years would be ample time to allow. A period of 1500 years may\r\ntherefore be taken to cover the whole of the changes which took\r\nplace during the period of gradual submergence.\r\n\r\nIf this is approximately correct, the date at which the submergence\r\nbegan was only 5000 years ago, or about 3000 B.C. The estimate may\r\nhave to be modified as we obtain better evidence; but it is as well\r\nto realize clearly that we are not dealing with a long period, of\r\ngreat geological antiquity; we are dealing with times when the\r\nEgyptian, Babylonian, and Minoan civilizations flourished. Northern\r\nEurope was then probably barbarous, and metals had not come into use;\r\nbut the amber trade of the Baltic was probably in full swing. Rumours\r\nof any great disaster, such as the submergence of thousands of square\r\nmiles and the displacement of large populations might spread far and\r\nwide along the trade routes. Is it possible that thus originated some\r\nof the stories of the deluge?\r\n\r\nWe will not now pursue this enquiry; but it is well to bear in mind\r\nthe probability that here geology, archaeology, and history meet and\r\noverlap. Any day one of our submerged forests may yield some article\r\nof Egyptian manufacture of known date, such as a scarab, which has\r\npassed from hand to hand along the ancient trade routes, till it\r\nreached a country still living in the Stone Age, where its only use\r\nwould be in magic. But it might now serve to give us a definite date\r\nfor one of these submerged forests. It might happen to have been\r\nlost with some of the stone implements, or with one of the human\r\nskeletons, apparently belonging to persons drowned, for no trace of\r\na grave is ever mentioned. A find of this sort is no more improbable\r\nthan the discovery of a useless modern revolver in a bag of stone\r\nand bone tools belonging to some Esquimaux far beyond the reach of\r\nordinary civilized races.\r\n\r\nIn this connexion it might be worth while systematically to dredge\r\nthe Dogger Bank, in order to see whether any implements made by man\r\ncan be found there. The alluvial deposits are there so free from\r\nstones that if any at all are found in them they may probably show\r\nhuman workmanship. The Dogger Bank may have remained an island long\r\nafter great part of the bed of the North Sea had been submerged, for\r\nthe Bank now forms a submerged plateau. It may even have lasted into\r\nfairly recent times, the final destruction of the island being due\r\nto the planing away of the upper part of the soft alluvial strata\r\nthrough the attacks of the sea and of boring molluscs. _Pholas_ is\r\nnow actively attacking the hard peat-beds at a depth of more than\r\n10 fathoms, and is rapidly destroying this accumulation of moorlog,\r\nwherever the tidal scour is sufficient to lay it bare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n\r\n  BRÖGGER, W.
