The journey could be done by canoe, but there are\r\nnone available at this time.  So a party of people are sent overland to\r\nfetch what is required.\r\n\r\nThere are encounters with bears and other dangerous animals; there are\r\ntimes when they are very hungry and very tired.  They encounter both\r\nfriendly and unfriendly Indians.  They borrow canoes at one stage, and\r\nhave wrecks in the mighty rapids.\r\n\r\nThere are strong overtones indicating that Kingston has read the\r\nauthentic books by Ballantyne, who had worked in the Hudson Bay Company,\r\nand whose letters home had set off his literary career.  But Kingston\r\nhas a unique style of his own, and he was good at research, so he can be\r\nforgiven for using valuable authentic material to help him get his facts\r\nright, and make his story credible.\r\n\r\nAbout 10.5 hours to read aloud.\r\n\r\n________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nSNOW SHOES AND CANOES, THE EARLY DAYS OF A FUR-TRADER IN THE HUDSON BAY\r\nTERRITORY, BY WILLIAM H G KINGSTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER ONE.\r\n\r\nBLACK FORT--THE PACK-HORSE TRAIN SETS OUT--SANDY MCTAVISH'S SAGACITY--\r\nTHE NIGHT-WATCH--THE TWO REDSKIN HORSE-THIEVES--A SNOWSTORM--AN\r\nUNCOMFORTABLE BED AND A TERRIBLE NIGHT--MY DELIGHT AT FINDING MY HORSE\r\nALIVE--WE OBTAIN SHELTER IN A WOOD--DESPERATE ENCOUNTER BETWEEN A LYNX\r\nAND AN EAGLE FOR THE POSSESSION OF A HARE--THE HARE BECOMES MY PRIZE--\r\nTHE UNTIMELY APPEARANCE OF A WOLF.\r\n\r\nThe short summer of the North-West Territory of British America, the\r\nregion in which the events I am about to describe took place, was\r\nrapidly drawing to a close.\r\n\r\nI had been sent from Black Fort, of which my elder brother Alick had\r\ncharge, with Sandy McTavish, an old follower of our father's, and two\r\nother men, to bring up ammunition and other stores as a winter supply\r\nfrom Fort Ross, about 150 miles off--a distance, however, of which we\r\ndid not think much.\r\n\r\nThe stores ought to have been brought up the greater part of the way by\r\nthe Saskatchewan, but a canoe had been lost in ascending the rapids, and\r\nno other was at that time to be procured to replace her.  It became\r\nnecessary, therefore, at all costs to transport the required stores by\r\nland.  We had eight pack-horses, besides the four animals my companions\r\nand I rode.\r\n\r\nWe were all well armed, for though the Crees and other Indian tribes in\r\nthe northern part of the territory were generally friendly, we might\r\npossibly encounter a party of Blackfeet on the war-trail who, should\r\nthey find us unprepared, would to a certainty attack us, and endeavour\r\nto steal our horses and goods.  We were but few in number for such an\r\nundertaking, but no more men could be spared.  Sandy, however, was a\r\nhost in himself.  He thoroughly knew all the Indian ways, and from his\r\nlong experience was well able to counteract them.\r\n\r\nMany an evening, while seated at our camp-fire or at the stove in the\r\nfort, during winter, has he beguiled the time with accounts of his\r\nhairbreadth escapes and desperate encounters with the redskins.  He had\r\nno enmity towards them, notwithstanding the attempts they had made on\r\nhis life.\r\n\r\n\"They were but following the instincts of their savage natures,\" he used\r\nto observe; \"and they were not ower weel pleased with the white men for\r\nhunting in the country which they call theirs, though it must be allowed\r\nthey dinna make gude use of it.\"\r\n\r\nSandy was as humane as he was brave, and I am very sure he never took\r\nthe life of an Indian if he could avoid doing so with due regard to his\r\nown safety.  He had come out from Scotland when a mere boy with our\r\nfather, who was at that time a clerk in the Hudson's Bay Company, but\r\nwho had ultimately risen to be a chief factor, and was the leader in\r\nmany of the adventurous expeditions which were made in those days.  He\r\nwas noted for being a dead shot, and a first-rate hunter whether of\r\nbuffalo, elk, or grizzly bear.  Sandy had followed him in all his\r\nexpeditions, and took the greatest delight in describing them to us.\r\n\r\nHaving remained at Fort Ross a couple of days, to rest our beasts and\r\nprepare the packages for transport, we set out, Sandy and I leading, and\r\nthe two men, Pat Casey and Pierre Lacrosse, following in the rear with\r\nthe baggage animals.\r\n\r\nWe travelled at the rate of about twenty-five miles each day.  That\r\ndistance being accomplished, we encamped at night under shelter of a\r\ngrove of poplars or willows, we being glad of the protection they\r\nafforded; for although the weather was fine, the wind had begun to blow\r\nsomewhat cold.\r\n\r\nOur beasts having been unloaded were hobbled near at hand, the goods\r\nbeing piled up so as to form a breastwork in case of an attack.  Fuel to\r\nlast the night had then to be collected, when the fire was lighted, and\r\nthe pot put on to boil.\r\n\r\nSupper being ready, we sat round our fire to discuss it, with good\r\nappetites.  We then, after a chat for half an hour or so, drawing our\r\nbuffalo-robes over us, with our saddles for pillows, lay down to rest,\r\nour feet turned towards the fire.  One of us, however, always remained\r\non guard, to watch the horses, and to give warning should any Blackfeet\r\nIndians or prowling wolves draw near our encampment.\r\n\r\nWe did not believe that we had much to fear from either one or the\r\nother.  The Blackfeet seldom ventured so far north into the territory of\r\ntheir hereditary enemies the Crees; and should any wolves approach, the\r\nhorses would be sure to make their way up to the camp for protection.\r\n\r\nThe two hours watch which each of us took in turn made us sleep the\r\nsounder for the remainder of the time.  We were all too well inured to\r\nthe sort of life to think it any hardship.  Just before dawn the last\r\nman on watch roused up the rest of us.  The ashes were raked together,\r\nfresh sticks put on, the water boiled for the tea, and a breakfast of\r\nslices of bacon or dried buffalo meat, with flour cakes, prepared us for\r\nthe toils of the day.\r\n\r\nThe country over which we travelled was seldom traversed by white men.\r\nThe grass-covered prairie extended often as far as the eye could reach,\r\nhere and there hills rising in the distance, or long lines of trees\r\nmarking the course of some stream falling into the main river.\r\n\r\nWe had to cross several of these streams, but at that time of the year\r\nwere able to ford them without difficulty, the drought of summer having\r\ngreatly diminished their depth.\r\n\r\nSandy and I were jogging along at the head of our party when, as we\r\nreached the summit of a slight hill from which we could obtain an\r\nextensive view over the surrounding country, he stopped and gazed, I\r\nthought somewhat anxiously, around the horizon.\r\n\r\n\"We must push on faster than we have been going, if we are to reach\r\nBlack Fort before bad weather comes on,\" he observed.\r\n\r\n\"I see no change in the appearance of the sky,\" I answered.  \"There's\r\nnot a cloud in any direction, and the wind is as moderate as it was when\r\nwe started.\"\r\n\r\n\"The sky is blue and cloudless, I'll allow, but it's whiter away in the\r\nnor'ard than I like to see it.  There will be wind from that quarter\r\nbefore long, and the wind won't come alone,\" said Sandy.  \"It may not\r\nreach us to-morrow or the next day, and we may be safe within the fort\r\nbefore it is down upon us.\"\r\n\r\nThough I had a high opinion of Sandy's sagacity, I thought that in this\r\ninstance he might be mistaken.  It was very important for us to reach\r\nthe fort before the snow should cover the ground to any depth.  The\r\nstores we were bringing were much required, and the heavily-laden\r\nanimals would have great difficulty in making their way through it.  Of\r\ncourse I agreed, as Sandy advised it, that we should push on that day as\r\nlong as the light would allow, and that we should make a forced march on\r\nthe following day, so that we might reach the fort on the next before\r\nnightfall, which we calculated we should thus be able to do.\r\n\r\nWaiting till the two men with the loaded beasts came up, we told them of\r\nour intentions, and ordered them to push on as fast as they could.  We\r\nhad not gone far, however, when Sandy's horse stumbled, a very unusual\r\nthing for the animal to do.  It continued to walk lame, evidently in\r\npain.\r\n\r\nWe dismounted and examined its feet, when we found that a sharp stone\r\nhad wounded its hoof.  We extricated it with considerable difficulty,\r\nand when we again moved on the animal walked with as much pain as\r\nbefore.  Nothing could make it move on.  We were therefore compelled to\r\nencamp at the first suitable spot we reached.\r\n\r\nThe weather remained fine, and we hoped in the morning that Sandy's\r\nhorse would have recovered, and that we should be able to make a long\r\nday's journey.  According to our intention, our camp was formed as usual\r\nunder shelter of a wood, but there was scarcely any good grass in the\r\nimmediate neighbourhood, and we were compelled to let the animals roam\r\nmuch further than we liked in search of it.\r\n\r\nWe agreed that, in order to keep a proper lookout, two of us should\r\nremain on the watch at a time, one in the camp, and the other in the\r\ndirection the animals had taken.\r\n\r\nSandy had Pierre for his mate; I, Pat.  Sandy and Pierre took the first\r\nwatch.  The latter went off with his rifle and a brace of pistols in his\r\nbelt, to walk backwards and forwards near where the horses were feeding.\r\nPat and I then lay down with our feet to the fire.\r\n\r\n\"We'll sleep as fast as we can, Mister David, to make up for the\r\nshortness of time we've got to do it in,\" observed Pat, as he rolled\r\nhimself up in his buffalo-robe.\r\n\r\nI endeavoured to follow his advice, but somehow or other the\r\npresentiment that danger threatened us kept me awake longer than was\r\nusual.  It seemed that I had scarcely closed my eyes when Sandy aroused\r\nme, and springing to my feet I examined the priming of my rifle and\r\npistols, and prepared to relieve Pierre, who was to wait near the horses\r\ntill I arrived.  I had to walk nearly a quarter of a mile before I found\r\nhim in a grassy valley, between two slight hills running in the\r\ndirection of the river.  Had there been any trees thereabouts it would\r\nhave been a better place than the one we had chosen for our encampment.\r\nPierre reported all right, and went back to camp.\r\n\r\nBy walking to the top of one of the hills I could get a view all round,\r\nand watch the horses feeding below me.  I counted them and found that\r\nall were there, and then went down again to find some shelter from the\r\nwind behind a small clump of low bushes.  I could watch from this most\r\nof the horses, but some of them would wander up the valley out of my\r\nsight.\r\n\r\nAt last I saw by the movements of those near me that they were becoming\r\nsomewhat uneasy, and presently two which had got to a distance came up\r\nas fast as their hobbles would allow them, the whole heading towards the\r\ncamp.  I rushed forward to cut the hobbles as fast as I could get up to\r\nthe animals, when they all set off in the direction they had before been\r\ngoing.\r\n\r\nI had just set the last free when, looking up, I saw two dark figures\r\nwhich I knew were those of Indians, who had been endeavouring to get up\r\nto the horses before I could set them at liberty.  The moment they found\r\nthat they were discovered they stopped short.  I pointed my gun, they\r\nhesitated, and then once more began to move towards me, their scalping\r\nknives gleaming in the moonlight.  Anxious not to shed blood, I again\r\nshouted to them to stop; but perhaps seeing, by my voice and slight\r\nfigure, that I was but a youth, they fancied that they could intimidate\r\nme, and uttering terrific shrieks they continued to approach.  My life\r\ndepended, I knew, on the steadiness of my aim, and pulling the trigger I\r\nsent a bullet into the body of one of the strangers.  He staggered and\r\nfell, when drawing a pistol I prepared to receive his companion, who,\r\nhowever, stopped, and lifting the wounded man to his feet, the two made\r\noff faster than I should have supposed possible.\r\n\r\nI thought it prudent not to follow, as I felt sure that other Indians\r\nwere in the neighbourhood.  The sound of my shot would have aroused my\r\nfriends, and from the appearance of the horses they would understand\r\nwhat had happened.\r\n\r\nAs the Indians made off in one direction, I ran as fast as my legs could\r\ncarry me towards the camp.  Before I reached it, I met Sandy and the\r\nother men coming out to my assistance.  They expressed their\r\nsatisfaction at finding me safe.\r\n\r\nPierre and Pat wanted to set off in pursuit of the enemy, but Sandy\r\nwould not allow them.\r\n\r\n\"Na! na! laddies; we'll gain nothing even if we were to shoot a score of\r\nredskins.  We shall want our ammunition to defend ourselves when we are\r\nattacked.  Let's count the horses, and see if all have come in,\" he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nOn doing so, we discovered that one was missing.  The animal had\r\nevidently been carried off by some Blackfeet.\r\n\r\nThe loss was a serious one, as we should have either to add to the\r\nweight of the loads of the others, or place the packages on one of the\r\nsaddle-horses, taking it by turns to walk.\r\n\r\nOne thing was certain, that even if not attacked, our journey, which we\r\nwere anxious to finish as soon as possible, would be prolonged.\r\n\r\nAs may be supposed, we got no more sleep that night.  We had to hobble\r\nthe horses, and keep a bright lookout on every side, lest the\r\ntreacherous Indians might steal upon us and catch us unprepared.  They\r\nmust have guessed from the number of horses that our party consisted of\r\nseveral men, well armed, and from the experience they had had of my\r\nrifle they knew that they could not come openly upon us without the\r\ncertainty of some of their number being laid low.\r\n\r\nAs the sky remained clear, and the moon was bright, we could see objects\r\nat a considerable distance; our enemies could not therefore get near\r\nwithout being discovered.  Our chief fear was that they might, if they\r\nwere resolved on our destruction, make a wide circuit, and getting into\r\nthe wood attack us in the rear.  To prevent the risk of this, Pierre\r\nmade his way among the trees and watched on that side; on hands and\r\nknees he crept cautiously from place to place, as the panther does\r\nwatching for its prey.  Wary as the Indians were, it was not likely that\r\nthey would surprise him.  There is an excitement in an adventure of the\r\nsort we were engaged in which affords actual pleasure, and for my part I\r\nenjoyed it greatly, caring neither for being deprived of sleep, nor for\r\nthe danger to be apprehended.\r\n\r\nWe let our fire remain in, though we kept it low, with plenty of sticks\r\nat hand which we could throw on and make it blaze up, should we find it\r\nnecessary.  At last dawn appeared in the eastern sky, and we believed\r\nthat, as the Indians had not attacked us at night, they would not molest\r\nus during our journey.\r\n\r\nHaving collected our horses and distributed the load of the animal which\r\nhad been stolen among them, after a hasty breakfast we set off.  We were\r\nmuch disappointed at finding that Sandy's animal was as lame as on the\r\nprevious day, and as it could not move out of a walk, he dismounted and\r\nproceeded on foot.  Our progress was therefore slower even than usual.\r\n\r\nThe country as we advanced became much rougher than that which we had\r\nhitherto passed over.  When the greater part of the day had been spent,\r\nwe reached the foot of an excessively steep hill, on the top of which\r\nwas a wide extending plain.  We all here dismounted, and allowed our\r\nhorses to scramble on as best they could.  To climb up with more ease I\r\ndisencumbered myself of my cloak, which together with my gun I fastened\r\non to one of the pack-horses.  We had provided ourselves with thick\r\nsticks, which helped us along.\r\n\r\nSandy's poor horse had great difficulty in making its way, and dropped\r\nbehind the rest.  There was no fear of its straying; the animals being\r\naccustomed to keep together, it was sure to follow.\r\n\r\n\"I wish that we had been able to make our way as fast as we had\r\nintended,\" said Sandy.  \"We shall have more difficulties on this journey\r\nthan we looked for; however, there's no use sighing about what cannot be\r\nhelped.  Just do you go on, David, to the top of the hill, and take a\r\nlook round to see if you can catch sight of any Indians.  You are more\r\nactive than I am, and will be at the top before I can reach it; I'll\r\nwait and bring up the rest of the horses.  If the Indians were to come\r\nupon us at this moment they might take us at a disadvantage.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the way Sandy spoke I saw that he was not like himself.  It struck\r\nme that he was ill; or, had he expected that we should have been\r\nattacked by the Indians during our ascent of the hill, he would have\r\nmade preparations beforehand.  I, however, did not hesitate to do as he\r\nwished, and springing forward soon climbed up among the rocks and shrubs\r\nto the top.  Before me, stretching to the westward, was a perfectly\r\nlevel plain, on the edge of which I looked down on the other side over\r\nthe lower country, across which we had passed.\r\n\r\nI could see our horses toiling upwards among the rocks and shrubs to the\r\ntop, followed by Sandy and the two other men, he having stopped to speak\r\nto them.  The sky overhead and on three sides was clear, but on looking\r\nto the northward I observed a dense black mass which came sweeping along\r\nat a tremendous rate towards me.  Though the air had just before been\r\nperfectly serene, on a sudden a keen cutting wind struck me with a force\r\nwhich almost took me off my feet.\r\n\r\nThe next instant I was in the midst of a fearful snowstorm.  The sun in\r\na moment became obscured, and the wind increasing rose to a perfect\r\nhurricane.  I could dimly discern two of the horses which just then had\r\nreached the plateau.  I ran towards one of them to secure it, hoping\r\nthat it was my own, but I found that it was one of the loaded animals,\r\nand unfortunately not the one on which I had laid my coat and gun.  In a\r\nfew seconds of time, so fearful had become the darkness that I could not\r\nsee three feet ahead of my nose.  I shouted at the top of my voice to\r\nthe rest of the men who were, I knew, not far from me to mount their\r\nhorses and come on, allowing the others to shift for themselves.\r\n\r\nWe should all be frozen to death if we were to remain where we were.\r\nOur only hope of safety was to reach a thick grove of trees at the\r\nfarther end, and I hoped that we might get to it before the snow became\r\ntoo deep to allow the animals to move rapidly over the ground.\r\n\r\nIn vain I looked for my own horse.  I could faintly hear Sandy and the\r\nother men shouting in return to my cries, but whereabouts they were I\r\ncould not tell.  I fully believed that they would all follow the course\r\nI proposed, and as I could not discover my own animal I cut the tyings\r\nand threw off the load from the pack-horse I had caught, then mounting\r\non the pack-saddle I rode off at full speed through the deep snow, in\r\nthe hope of reaching the wood.\r\n\r\nSo rapidly did the snow come down that in a few moments it was several\r\ninches deep.  Every instant it was increasing and rendering my progress\r\nmore difficult.  I urged on the poor animal, which seemed to know its\r\ndanger and did its utmost, but thicker and thicker fell the snow, and in\r\na short time, night coming on, it became so dark that I was literally\r\nunable to see my hand held close to my face; except judging by the wind,\r\nI could not tell in what direction we were going.  I could only hope\r\nthat the instinct of the animal might guide it towards the wood in which\r\nshelter could be obtained.\r\n\r\nAs to seeking my companions, that was out of the question.  I shouted to\r\nthem every now and then, but no voice answered my calls.  I knew,\r\nhowever, that they all, being well acquainted with the country, would\r\nendeavour to reach the shelter for which I was aiming, and I hoped at\r\nlength to meet them there.\r\n\r\nThe cold was intense; even had I possessed my overcoat it would have\r\nbeen bad enough to bear, but with only moderately thick clothing on, I\r\nfelt the wind pierce to my very bones.  I rode on, however, as long as I\r\nwas able to sit my horse, but at length my limbs became so benumbed by\r\nthe cold that I could ride no further.  The poor beast also was almost\r\nexhausted with his exertions in plunging on through the deep snow.\r\n\r\nHoping to keep somewhat warm by walking I dismounted, and leading him by\r\nthe bridle tried to get along.  At every step I made I sank halfway up\r\nto my knees, and could scarcely lift my feet high enough to make another\r\nstep forward; still, it would be death to stay where I was.  I went on,\r\nhoping that I was approaching the wood.  Now and then I stopped and\r\nshouted; still there was no reply.\r\n\r\nI became at length convinced that I must have either passed the wood or\r\nbeen going in another direction.  No sound reached my ears but that of\r\nthe thick-falling snow, which seemed to come down in a mass upon the\r\nearth, so rapidly did it accumulate.\r\n\r\nSandy, I knew, would be very anxious about me, and would take every\r\nmeans to discover where I had gone; but even in daylight he could not\r\nhave followed my track, as the snow must instantly have obliterated it.\r\n\r\nI resolved as long as I had strength to push on, though I had missed the\r\nwood for which I was aiming.  I might, I hoped, in time reach another\r\nwhich would afford me protection.\r\n\r\nThe storm instead of abating only seemed to increase in violence.  As\r\nthe night wore on I found my poor horse advancing at a slower and slower\r\npace, showing how fatigued it had become, while I had scarcely strength\r\nleft to move forward; still I was afraid to halt.  At last it stopped\r\naltogether, and I myself felt utterly exhausted.  Further it was\r\nimpossible to go, but how to endure the cold and keep the blood\r\ncirculating in my veins was the question.  It seemed to me that I must\r\ninevitably perish; still I resolved to make an effort to preserve my\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nMy horse was standing stock-still, with its back to the wind.  I\r\nbethought me that the only chance I had of retaining existence was to\r\ndig a hole in the snow, in which I might crouch down, and wait till the\r\nstorm was over.  I set desperately to work.  While so employed, the\r\ndrift eddying around my head nearly suffocated me; still I persevered.\r\n\r\nHaving dug down to the ground, I took off the pack-saddle from the\r\nhorse's back, which I placed as a cushion below me, and then putting the\r\nsaddle-cloth over my shoulders I crouched down in the hole I had made,\r\nwhich I could not help dreading was more likely to prove my grave than\r\nto afford any efficient shelter.\r\n\r\nI knew for certain that, should I fall asleep, death would ensue, and\r\nthat I must exert all my energies to keep awake.  I had not been long\r\nseated, doubled up in my burrow like a mummy, before I felt the cold\r\nbegin to steal over me.  My feet were the first to suffer.  I tried to\r\nkeep them warm by moving them about, but it was of no use.\r\n\r\nAt last I took off my frozen shoes, and tucked my feet under me on the\r\npack-saddle; then I rubbed them as hard as I could.  I was tempted at\r\nlast to take the horsecloth off my shoulders, and to wrap my feet up in\r\nit, but all was of no use.  They appeared to me to be frozen, while my\r\nwhole body seemed changing into ice.  At last I had scarcely strength to\r\nmove either my hands or feet.  During this time the inclination to sleep\r\nalmost overcame me.  I struggled against it with all the resolution I\r\npossessed.  I was perfectly well aware that, should I give way to it,\r\ndeath would be the consequence.\r\n\r\nI took every means I could think of to keep awake.  I shouted; I even\r\nsang, or rather I tried to sing; but the most melancholy strains were\r\nthe only results of my efforts, my voice sounding as hollow as that from\r\na skull--if voices ever do come out of skulls, on which subject I\r\nventure to be sceptical.\r\n\r\nI kept moving from side to side, and up and down, filled with the dread\r\nthat, should I stop, I should fall asleep.  The snow all the time was\r\ngathering round my head, forming an arch over me, and I had frequently\r\nto make a hole in front, so as to obtain sufficient air for breathing.\r\n\r\nHow I lived through that dreadful night I cannot tell.  Morning came at\r\nlast; the snow had ceased to fall as thickly as before, allowing the\r\nlight to penetrate through the veil drawn over the earth.  Faint as was\r\nthe light, it gave me a glimpse of hope.  I might still reach the wood,\r\nand by obtaining a fire thaw my benumbed limbs.  My first efforts were\r\ndirected towards breaking out of my icy prison; but the hole in front of\r\nme was so small that it was not till I had made several attempts that I\r\ncould force my body through it.\r\n\r\nI at length managed to get up on my feet, when I took a look round.\r\nThere stood my poor horse, where I had left it, rigid as a statue, and,\r\nas I believed, frozen to death.\r\n\r\nOn every side I could see nothing but one vast expanse of snow.  I could\r\nnot, however, remain where I was.  Either on horseback or on foot I must\r\ntry to reach a place of shelter and to find my companions.  I now\r\nremembered that I had taken my shoes off.  How to get them on again was\r\nthe difficulty, for when I felt them, I found that they were frozen as\r\nhard as iron.  I made several attempts to thrust in my feet, for I knew\r\nthat they would be dreadfully cut should I attempt to walk without\r\nshoes.  The exertion contributed somewhat, perhaps, to restore the\r\ncirculation in my veins, and at last, after many efforts, I got on my\r\nshoes.\r\n\r\nHaving accomplished this I broke entirely out of my burrow, and\r\nstaggered towards my poor steed.  To my great relief the animal moved\r\nits head and looked at me, giving evidence that it was still alive.  I\r\naccordingly returned to the hole and dug out my saddle, when, after\r\ngreat exertion, I managed to reach the horse and put it on.  Then,\r\ndigging round the poor beast's front feet, and patting it on the neck, I\r\ninduced it to move forward a few paces.\r\n\r\nIt seemed surprising that, after the fearful night it had endured, it\r\nshould still be alive and could move its legs apparently without much\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\nI now tried to mount, but could not bend my frozen limbs sufficiently to\r\nget into the saddle.  I therefore, taking the bridle in my hand, led\r\nforward my horse, stumbling at every step.  I hoped, however, that the\r\nexercise would restore circulation, and that I should be able at last to\r\nget on horseback.\r\n\r\nI looked round, but could nowhere see the wood of which I was in search;\r\nthough the snow was not falling as thickly as it had done during the\r\nnight, the weather still looked very threatening.  Dark masses of\r\nsnow-clouds obscured the sky like a canopy but a few feet, it seemed,\r\nabove my head.\r\n\r\nThe wind was still piercingly cold, and at any moment the snow might\r\nagain come down and overwhelm me.  The rough training I had gone\r\nthrough, however, had taught me never to despair, but to struggle on to\r\nthe last.  I had no thoughts of doing otherwise, though every limb\r\nached, and I had scarcely strength to draw one leg after the other.\r\n\r\nAt last, finding that I could walk no longer, I made another effort to\r\nmount, and succeeded, though not without great pain, in climbing into\r\nthe saddle; when I was there, however, my poor horse showed his utter\r\ninability to carry me, and refused to lift a leg; indeed, his strength\r\nwas insufficient for the task.  In vain I patted his neck and tried to\r\nmake him go forward.  The only movement he made was to sink down on his\r\nknees.  To prevent him from falling altogether, when I might not have\r\nbeen able to get him up again, I threw myself off his back.\r\n\r\nAt the same moment the storm burst forth with greater fury than before.\r\nI began to believe that I should perish; but still I had some strength\r\nleft in me, and resolved to exert it to the utmost.  As to facing the\r\nstorm, that was impossible, so all I could do was to turn my back to it\r\nand move forward.\r\n\r\nI might be going further and further from the wood, but I trusted that\r\nProvidence, which had hitherto preserved me, would direct my steps\r\ntowards some other shelter.  Still I in vain looked out for any object\r\nrising above the apparently interminable plain of snow.  The\r\nsaddle-cloth drawn tightly over my shoulders somewhat protected my back,\r\nbut the wind whistled past my ears, which had now lost all sensation.\r\n\r\nOn and on I went, I knew not for how long.  I could scarcely think,\r\nindeed I could scarcely feel, except that I was suffering all over from\r\npain.  The storm sent me along, in what direction I could not tell,\r\nthough I supposed that it was towards the south.  The thick-falling snow\r\nhid all objects, if any there were, from sight.  My companions might be\r\nin the neighbourhood, but I was not likely to see them, nor they me.\r\n\r\nI tried occasionally to shout out, but I had not power to send my voice\r\nto any distance.  Still I went on, like a hawker crying his wares in a\r\ntown, but I had lost all hopes of hearing an answer to my calls.  At\r\nlast so great became my exhaustion that I thought of killing my horse,\r\nopening him, and getting into his body, fancying that I might thus save\r\nmy life.  I drew my hunting-knife, and was about to plunge it into the\r\npoor brute's chest, though even then I felt a great repugnance to kill\r\nthe faithful creature; when it occurred to me, should I get inside,\r\nthat, after the heat had left the body, it would freeze, and I might be\r\nunable to extricate myself.  I should thus be immured in a tomb of my\r\nown making.  The idea was too dreadful to contemplate for an instant.\r\n\r\nI sheathed my knife, and again walked on.  Shortly after this the storm\r\nsensibly abated.  The snow ceased, the wind fell; and as the atmosphere\r\nbecame clear I found that I was on the edge of the plateau, and I saw\r\nbefore me in the far distance a thick wood extending away to the south.\r\nIt bordered a stream flowing, I concluded, into the Saskatchewan.  I\r\ncould find shelter within the wood should the storm again come on, and I\r\nmight be able to kill some creature or other to satisfy the cravings of\r\nmy appetite.\r\n\r\nThe hope that I might still preserve my life raised my spirits.  My\r\nhorse, too, appeared to be somewhat recovered; so I again climbed up on\r\nthe saddle, and this time the animal consented to move forward, its\r\ninstinct telling it that food was to be found in the direction we were\r\ngoing.  Had I possessed my gun I should have been better satisfied, as I\r\ncould thus, without difficulty, be able to obtain provisions and defend\r\nmyself against any wild beasts or Indians I might encounter.  My\r\nimpatience made me fancy that my horse was moving at a very slow pace.\r\nHe seemed to gather strength as he advanced, or rather his muscles\r\nbecame more pliable, and he moved with less pain.  I was still, I\r\ncalculated, at least two days' journey from the fort.  It would be\r\nimpossible for either my steed or me to perform the distance in our\r\npresent condition.\r\n\r\nAbout the animal I had no fear, as it would be able to pick up grass\r\nfrom under the snow, even should that not disappear; but my chance of\r\nobtaining food was far more problematical.  At last the sun shone forth\r\nand warmed my well-nigh frozen body.  Its bright rays cheered my\r\nspirits, and I could look more hopefully to the prospect of getting back\r\nto the fort.  I had not given up all expectation of falling in with some\r\nof my companions.  It occurred to me that they might at once have put\r\nbefore the wind, as sailors say, and steered for the wood towards which\r\nI was directing my course.\r\n\r\nI looked out, almost expecting to see a wreath of white smoke curling up\r\nfrom amidst the trees.  No signs of human beings, however, could I\r\ndiscover.  As we advanced my horse increased its pace, and at last the\r\nwood was reached, but on the weather side the snow was piled up more\r\nthickly than even in the open ground.  I had, therefore, to make a\r\ncircuit, till I could get to the lee side.\r\n\r\nIn course of time, however, I reached it, and found a deep bay or hollow\r\nformed by the trees.  Here the snow was comparatively shallow.  As I\r\nthrew myself from my horse and took off the bridle, the sagacious animal\r\nimmediately began to grub away with its nose in the snow, and soon got\r\ndown to the green grass which grew there abundantly.\r\n\r\nI was very sure that my steed would not stray away, so that there was no\r\nnecessity for hobbling it.  Fastening the bridle over my shoulder, I\r\nhurried into the wood to collect sticks to light a fire, at which I\r\nmight thaw my shoes and warm myself thoroughly.  I was satisfied that,\r\nin spite of the cold I had endured, I was nowhere severely frostbitten.\r\nAs I came along I had rubbed my ears with snow, which had restored\r\ncirculation.  Even my feet and fingers, though bitterly cold, had\r\nescaped.\r\n\r\nHaving collected a number of sticks, I scraped away the snow at a short\r\ndistance from the trees, and piled them up.  I then felt in my pocket\r\nfor my flint and steel and tinder box.  I at once found the latter, but\r\nto my dismay I could not discover the flint and steel.\r\n\r\nI remembered giving it, the last time we encamped, to Pat Casey, but I\r\ncould not recollect whether he had returned it.  I was almost in\r\ndespair.  I feared that, should I attempt to pass another night without\r\nfire, I must perish, even were the cold less intense than it had been\r\npreviously.\r\n\r\nPat Casey was bound to give them back to me.  He must have done so.\r\n\r\nI remembered that I had pockets in my waistcoat.  I unbuttoned my coat,\r\nand there at the bottom in the left-hand pocket of my waistcoat I found\r\nmy flint and steel.  They were of more value to me just then than a\r\npurse of gold.\r\n\r\nI quickly struck a light, and going down on my knees, by the aid of some\r\ndried moss and leaves, and by dint of careful blowing, I soon had a fire\r\nstarted, as we say in the Far West.  Eagerly I bent over it.  Its genial\r\nwarmth imparted new life to my chilled limbs and body.  Then, sitting\r\ndown with my feet so close that I almost singed my stockings, I\r\ngradually thawed my shoes.  How comfortable they felt when I again put\r\nthem on!\r\n\r\nI now began to feel the pangs of hunger, for I had taken nothing since\r\nthe previous morning.  Food I must have at all costs.  I even glanced at\r\nmy poor horse with wolfish eyes.\r\n\r\n\"I must eat it, if I can get nothing else,\" I said to myself; but then\r\nagain I thought, \"By what means shall I reach the fort?  I cannot trudge\r\non foot all the distance through the deep snow.  I must let my horse\r\nlive.  It would sorely grieve me to have to kill him.\"\r\n\r\nThoroughly warmed, I got up with the intention of pushing into the wood\r\nand trying to knock over some bird or small beast.  There were few young\r\nbirds at that season not well able to fly out of my way, and the animals\r\nof the forest were likely to have been driven under shelter by the\r\nsnowstorm.\r\n\r\nI still had the stick which had served me to mount the hill and make my\r\nway over the snow.  I had left my pistols in my holsters.  I mention\r\nthis to account for my not now having them.  My only weapons, therefore,\r\nwere my long hunting-knife and this stout stick.\r\n\r\nI was, I knew, more likely to find some animals deep in the wood than on\r\nthe borders, as they would have gone there for shelter.  As I went along\r\nI anxiously examined every tree I passed in search of birds or the\r\ntraces of squirrels or any other of the smaller inhabitants of the\r\nwoods.\r\n\r\nNow and then a squirrel would look out of its hole, and on seeing me\r\nwould be off to the tree-top.  Birds were rare, and being perfectly\r\nsilent at this season, their notes did not betray their whereabouts.\r\nThe evening was drawing on.  I considered whether I could manage to set\r\nany traps.  It would take time to construct them, and I was starving.\r\n\r\nAs I wandered along, I found myself again near the borders of the wood\r\nwith a thick bush near me.  At that moment I caught sight of an animal\r\nof nearly three feet in length, which I at once recognised as a\r\n\"peeshoo,\" as the French Canadians call it, though properly denominated\r\nthe Canadian lynx.  Its fur was of a dark grey, freckled with black.  It\r\nhad powerful limbs, and thick, heavily-made feet.  It was still when I\r\nfirst caught sight of it, but presently it commenced a succession of\r\nbounds with its back slightly arched, all the feet coming to the ground\r\nat the same moment.\r\n\r\nInstead of moving forward in a direct line, I observed that it was\r\nmaking a large circle, which it gradually decreased.  I concealed myself\r\nbehind the bush, hoping that it would come near enough to give me a\r\nchance of rushing out and striking it a blow on the back, when I could\r\nat once have killed it.  With intense interest, therefore, I watched its\r\nproceedings.  I now observed a small animal which I saw was a hare in\r\nthe centre of the circle it was forming.  The little creature,\r\nterror-stricken, seemed unable to run off, though, being a fleeter\r\nanimal than the lynx, it might easily have escaped.\r\n\r\nThe lynx approached nearer and nearer the hare, keeping one of its sharp\r\neyes fixed on it all the time, when, having got sufficiently near to\r\nreach its prey, it made two bounds, and the hare the next moment was\r\ndead.\r\n\r\nI was on the point of rushing out to secure, as I hoped, both the lynx\r\nand the hare, when I saw a dark shadow cast on the ground, and, looking\r\nup, I caught sight of a golden eagle, which must have come from the\r\nfar-off Rocky Mountains, in the act of pouncing down on the lynx; the\r\nlatter, seeing its enemy, dropped the hare and prepared to defend itself\r\nand prevent its prey being carried off.  In spite of the large size of\r\nthe lynx, the eagle swooped downwards to the attack, striking with its\r\npowerful beak the quick-sighted animal on the back, into which it fixed\r\nits sharp talons.\r\n\r\nThe eagle had, however, not so firm a hold as to prevent the lynx from\r\nfreeing itself; then with its formidable claws it sprang at the bird,\r\ntearing some of the feathers from its breast.\r\n\r\nOn this the eagle rose into the air, and circling several times round, a\r\nshort distance above the earth, prepared undauntedly again to descend\r\nand renew the combat.  The lynx, watching every movement, as it saw the\r\nbird coming made a tremendous leap, trying to seize it by the neck; but\r\nthe eagle, striking its antagonist's body with its talons, threw it on\r\nits back, and again attempted to plunge its beak into the throat of the\r\nlynx.\r\n\r\nSo furiously did the two creatures struggle, and so thickly was the snow\r\nsent flying round them, while the air was so filled with the eagle's\r\nfeathers, that I could scarcely distinguish what was taking place.\r\n\r\nI should have rushed forward to destroy both the combatants, had I not\r\nfeared that seeing me coming the eagle might fly off, and the lynx\r\nscamper away out of my reach, and I was too weak to follow it to any\r\ndistance.  I therefore let the fight proceed, hoping that I might\r\nbenefit by the utter exhaustion of the two parties, as is often the case\r\nwhen nations go to war, and a third interferes to reap an advantage from\r\nthe folly of the others.  I had to restrain my impatience for some\r\nminutes while the furious struggle continued.\r\n\r\nThe bird now made an attempt to rise, but it seemed to me that the lynx\r\nheld it fast.  I could restrain myself no longer, and, grasping my\r\nstick, I rushed forward.  Both creatures saw me coming.  The lynx got on\r\nits feet, but before it could make a single bound a well-directed blow\r\non its back laid it dead on the snow.  The eagle, to my surprise, did\r\nnot fly off, and I now saw that one of its wings was broken.  It still\r\npresented too formidable a front to be approached unless with due\r\ncaution, for its beak might inflict a serious wound.\r\n\r\nHolding my stick ready, I swung it with all my force against its head,\r\nand the bird rolled over stunned.  As it might quickly come to, I\r\nimmediately drew my knife and severed the head from the body.\r\n\r\nI was too hungry, however, to stop and examine either the eagle or the\r\nlynx, except to ascertain that the latter was perfectly dead.  A few\r\ncuts of my knife soon settled that point, and then eagerly taking up the\r\nhare, I hurried with it back to the fire.  I did not stop to skin it\r\nvery artistically, but running a spit through the body, I at once placed\r\nit to roast--camp fashion--on two forked sticks.  I watched it eagerly\r\nfor a few minutes, when, unable longer to resist the cravings of hunger,\r\nI cut off one of the legs, which I devoured nearly raw.\r\n\r\nThe keenness of my appetite being satisfied, I felt that I could wait\r\ntill the rest was more properly cooked.  I now bethought me that it\r\nwould be wise, while the hare was roasting, to bring in the lynx, at all\r\nevents; for though not dainty food, I had seen Indians eat the flesh of\r\nthe animal, and it was very possible that wolves might be attracted to\r\nthe spot and deprive me of it.\r\n\r\nI might have to wait a long time before my larder was supplied in so\r\ncurious a manner as it had been on this occasion.  I therefore hastened\r\nback to where I had left the lynx.  As I got up to it, I saw in the\r\ndistance an animal which I felt nearly sure was a wolf.  I must get back\r\nto the fire with my game, or the wolf might deprive me of it.\r\n\r\nShouldering the lynx, the weight of which was as much as I could carry,\r\nI struggled along with it towards my camp.  Every moment I expected to\r\nhear the wolf behind me, but as I at once struck into the wood I kept\r\nout of the creature's sight.  I was thankful when I saw the bright blaze\r\nof my fire between the trunks of the trees.  Hurrying forward, to my\r\ninfinite satisfaction I found the hare safe on the spit and almost done.\r\n\r\nI threw down my burden close to the fire, having made up my mind to\r\nfight for my prize should the wolf attempt to take it from me.  I might\r\nhave to do battle also, I knew, not only for myself, but for my horse,\r\nwhich, should the wolf discover, it would very probably attack.\r\n\r\nThe hare, which was now sufficiently cooked to be eaten, wonderfully\r\nrestored my strength and spirits.  A portion remained for my breakfast\r\nnext morning, and I must then commence on the flesh of the lynx.\r\n\r\nI had been so far preserved, and I was under no apprehension as to what\r\nmight happen.  I reflected, however, that it would be necessary to\r\nprepare some defence both for myself and my horse during the night\r\nagainst the attack of wolves, and I considered how that might best be\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nAs I had still a few minutes of daylight, I employed them in cutting\r\nsome stout sticks, which I fixed in the snow at a short distance from\r\nthe fire; others I fastened with withes to the top as rafters, on which\r\nI laid some branches, covering the whole with snow.\r\n\r\nI also formed the walls of my hut with snow.  There was fortunately a\r\nmoon in the sky, which enabled me to continue my labours long after\r\nsunset.\r\n\r\nHaving completed my hut, I collected a further supply of sticks, and\r\nmade up my fire to last, as I hoped, for two or three hours.  I then\r\nwent out, intending to bring my horse close to the hut.  I found him\r\nstill at his supper, and he seemed very unwilling to leave the spot\r\nwhere he had cleared away the snow.  On my speaking to him, with a\r\nlittle coaxing he, however, followed me, and I led him to the side of\r\nthe hut, where I secured him to a stake which I managed to drive into\r\nthe ground, for though covered with snow, it was soft below it.\r\n\r\nI then cleared away the snow sufficiently to enable him to get at the\r\ngrass.  This seemed to content him, and I hoped that he would remain\r\nquiet and get rested for the journey which I expected to commence the\r\nnext morning.  On examining my pile of sticks, I thought it would be\r\nprudent to get a further supply, so that I might keep the fire blazing\r\ntill daylight, and be able to cook some of the lynx for breakfast, as\r\nalso a sufficient quantity to take with me.\r\n\r\nFor this object I was going along the edge of the wood, when suddenly a\r\nlarge animal rushed out from a thick copse a short distance before me,\r\nplanting itself in a threatening attitude as if determined to dispute my\r\nprogress.  It was scarcely twenty feet off, and I knew that in a moment\r\nits fangs might be fixed in my throat.\r\n\r\nMy situation appeared desperate, for I felt sure that should I show the\r\nleast symptom of fear the creature would attack me.  I prayed for the\r\ncourage and firmness I so much needed.  Should I retreat, the monster\r\nwould to a certainty follow.  Holding the bundle of sticks I had already\r\ncollected in front of me as a shield, I flourished my stick, shouting as\r\nloud as my weak voice would permit.\r\n\r\nThe wolf appeared somewhat startled and retreated a few steps, still\r\nkeeping its piercing eyes fixed firmly on me.  The creature's retreat,\r\nthough it was but for a short distance, encouraged me.  I advanced.  On\r\nseeing this it set up a most fearful howl, which I concluded it did for\r\nthe purpose of collecting some of its fellows to assist it in its\r\nmeditated attack on me.\r\n\r\nI redoubled my cries, shouting out, \"Sandy!  Pat!  Pierre!  Come along!\"\r\nwith the idea that the wolf would suppose I had companions at hand, who\r\nwould come at my call.  As I advanced it kept retreating, but still\r\ncontinued its appalling howls.\r\n\r\nIt occurred to me that it was the wolf I had before seen, and that it\r\nmust have its lair in the neighbourhood.  This was not a pleasant\r\nthought, but still I hoped that if I could frighten it off I should not\r\nbe further molested.\r\n\r\nThe wolf continued howling and I shouting for nearly a quarter of an\r\nhour.  At length finding that no other wolves came to join it, and that\r\nI was determined not to flinch, it turned round, and in a few seconds\r\nwas lost to view in the surrounding gloom.\r\n\r\nI learnt an important lesson from the adventure.  It showed me that by\r\nan exhibition of courage and determination even enemies of far superior\r\nforce may be deterred from making an attack, and be put ignominiously to\r\nflight.  Having satisfied myself that the wolf had really gone off, I\r\nreturned to my hut, looking back, however, every instant to ascertain\r\nwhether or not it was following me.  I found my horse still cropping the\r\ngrass.  He welcomed me with a neigh as I approached, to show his\r\ngratitude.  It was a sign also that he was regaining his strength.\r\n\r\nI felt very thankful that I had not killed him, as I had contemplated\r\ndoing.\r\n\r\nHaving deposited my bundle of wood on the pile previously formed, I\r\ncrept into my hut.  I then placed some sticks across the entrance as a\r\nprotection against any sudden attack, and lay down on the pack-saddle,\r\ncovering my feet with the horse-rug.  Though the cold was sufficiently\r\nsevere under other circumstances to have kept me awake, before many\r\nminutes were over I was fast asleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWO.\r\n\r\nFIRST NIGHT IN MY SOLITARY CAMP--PAT CASEY RESCUED--LYNX BROTH--THE\r\nWOLF'S SECOND APPEARANCE--PAT'S \"DHRAMEING\"--THE WOLF AGAIN APPEARS--PAT\r\nRECOVERS AND SHOOTS THE \"BASTE\"--PAT'S NOVEL METHOD OF MAKING A FIRE\r\nBURN--LOSS OF OUR POWDER--WE CONSTRUCT HUNTING-SPEARS, AND COMMENCE OUR\r\nJOURNEY--OUR HORSES MYSTERIOUSLY DISAPPEAR--MARCHING WITHOUT FOOD--THE\r\nINFURIATED ELK--HAVING TAKEN REFUGE IN A TREE, MY SPEAR PROVES USEFUL--\r\nDEER'S FLESH A GOOD PREVENTIVE AGAINST STARVATION--SMOKED VENISON--\r\nMISKWANDIB IS STARVING, AND SO ARE HIS SQUAW AND CHILDREN--OUR NARROW\r\nESCAPE FROM BEING POISONED BY ROOTS.\r\n\r\nI had remembered before closing my eyes the importance of awaking in a\r\ncouple of hours.  It was the last thought that had occupied my mind.  I\r\nrecollect starting up and seeing the fire blazing brightly, which showed\r\nme that I could not have slept half the time I had intended.  The next\r\ntime, however, I awoke but a few embers were still burning.\r\n\r\nI sprang to my feet, and rushing out threw on some sticks.  I was\r\ncompelled to blow pretty hard to make them blaze up.  I was afraid that\r\nbefore they would do so the wolf might pay me a visit.  Perhaps he might\r\nappear with several companions.\r\n\r\nI was greatly relieved when the flames once more blazed up, and on\r\nlooking round beyond them I could see no animal in the neighbourhood.  I\r\ntherefore again retired within my hut, hoping that I might now rest\r\nsecurely till daylight.\r\n\r\nThe appalling howls of the wolf still rung in my ears; and though I\r\nslept on, it was under the impression that the monster was about to\r\nattack me.  I believe that the howlings were only in my own fancy, for\r\nwhen I once more awoke and looked out it was broad daylight.\r\n\r\nMy horse was standing quietly cropping the remainder of the grass,\r\nthough there was little enough he could manage to reach.  Having moved\r\nthe stake to a little distance, and cleared away the snow, so that he\r\nmight get at the grass without difficulty, I made up the fire, and put\r\nsome of the lynx flesh to roast before it.\r\n\r\nIt would not, I expected, prove very palatable, but it would enable me\r\nto support existence.  While the flesh was cooking I sat down inside my\r\nhut and devoured the remainder of the hare.  It was but a small animal,\r\nand what I had left from the previous evening was not sufficient to\r\nsatisfy my hunger, which was somewhat ravenous after the many hours I\r\nhad gone without food.\r\n\r\nI found in the morning, when attempting to move about, that my limbs\r\nwere very stiff, while my strength had greatly diminished, and I began\r\nto doubt whether I should be able to accomplish the journey I proposed\r\nwithout taking longer time to recruit.  I was, however very unwilling to\r\ndelay longer than I could help, Alick would be anxiously looking for me.\r\nI hoped that Sandy and the other men had escaped, for I knew that they\r\nalso, if they had strength sufficient, would not return home without\r\nendeavouring to discover what had become of me.\r\n\r\nI, however, still suffered a good deal of pain, and when I walked about\r\nmy legs felt stiff, and scarcely able to support my body; still, I hoped\r\nthat after I had breakfasted I should be sufficiently recovered to\r\ncommence my journey.  The lynx flesh being cooked, I ate a portion, but\r\nit was tough and unsavoury, and I was not sorry to finish my meal.\r\n\r\nI then got up, with the intention, before starting, of watering my horse\r\nat the stream, which I knew would not yet be frozen over, in spite of\r\nthe cold.  Putting on the saddle and bridle, I led him along the edge of\r\nthe wood in search of some narrow part through which we could make our\r\nway, for the wood, as far as I could see, bordered the stream for its\r\nwhole length.  I went on for some distance in the direction from which I\r\nhad come, when I caught sight afar off of a dark object rising out of\r\nthe plain of snow.\r\n\r\nOn examining it carefully between my hands, placed on either side of my\r\nhead, I saw that it was a horse standing stock-still, and it appeared to\r\nme that there was another small body at its feet.  It naturally occurred\r\nto me that the horse must be that of one of my companions, and\r\nimmediately throwing myself into the saddle I rode towards it.  In a\r\nshort time I was convinced that I had not been mistaken--that the object\r\nI saw was a horse, and that at its feet lay the body of a man.\r\n\r\nEvery moment was precious, for if he was still alive he must be in an\r\nalmost dying state, and would require instant attention.  As I got near\r\nI saw that the horse was held by the bridle, which the man on the ground\r\nwas still grasping in his hand.  This gave me some hope that the person\r\nwas still alive.\r\n\r\nI urged on my poor steed, who could scarcely move through the thick\r\nsnow.  At length, on reaching the man and horse, a glance showed me that\r\nthe man was Pat Casey!\r\n\r\nThrowing myself out of my saddle, and kneeling down by his side, I had\r\nthe satisfaction of discovering that he still breathed, though he was\r\napparently perfectly unconscious.  His horse was almost as far gone, and\r\nI saw was unable to carry him.\r\n\r\nMy first thought was to get poor Pat to the fire and give him some food.\r\nExerting all my strength, I accordingly lifted him on to my saddle,\r\nand, holding him there as well as I could, I set off to return to my\r\ncamp.  His horse followed mine, so that there was no necessity to lead\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThough the distance was not great, it took me a long time to perform it,\r\nand I was greatly afraid that he would expire before I could give him\r\nsome food, and restore the circulation in his veins.  Hurrying on as\r\nfast as I could make my horse move, we at last reached the hut, before\r\nwhich the fire was still burning.  I brought my horse close to the\r\nentrance, when, lowering Pat down off the saddle, I dragged him inside,\r\nfor I had not sufficient strength to carry him; indeed, I had found it a\r\nhard matter to get him into the saddle.\r\n\r\nThe first thing I did was to examine his brandy flask, but found it\r\nempty.  I would have given much for a small portion just then.  I next\r\ntook some of the roasted lynx meat, which I applied to his mouth, and\r\nsqueezed all the juice out of it down his throat.\r\n\r\nThe slight quantity of nourishment he thus swallowed, with the warmth of\r\nthe hut, had a beneficial effect, and he, opening his eyes, seemed to\r\nrecognise me, though he could not speak.  This encouraged me to\r\npersevere in my efforts to restore him.  I got off his shoes and\r\nstockings and rubbed his feet; then warming the stockings at the fire, I\r\nagain put them on.  I applied friction also to the palms of his hands\r\nand to his chest.\r\n\r\nWhile I was thus employed, I saw his horse, which had followed us,\r\napproach the hut.  It struck me that there was something very like a pot\r\nhanging from the saddle.  I rushed out and caught the animal, when, to\r\nmy delight, I discovered our saucepan, with a tin mug, which Pat at our\r\nlast encampment had probably forgotten to fasten to the baggage-mule,\r\nand had consequently secured to his own saddle.\r\n\r\nMaking up the fire, I instantly put on some of the lynx meat to concoct\r\nsome broth, which would, I knew, prove more efficacious than anything\r\nelse I could give to my suffering companion, while I myself should be\r\nvery glad of it.\r\n\r\nFortunately his gun was fastened to his saddle, and he had on his thick\r\ncoat.  A brace of pistols were also in his holsters.  Whatever might\r\nbefall him, I should thus have the means of defending myself and of\r\nprocuring game, for he had on his ammunition-belt, which was well\r\nsupplied with powder and shot.  The coat, with the aid of the\r\nhorse-cloths, would contribute greatly to our warmth at night, though I\r\ncould dispense with it during the daytime.\r\n\r\nWhile the broth was boiling, I continued to feed him with as much juice\r\nas I could press from the meat, for he was not in a fit state to eat\r\nsolid food.  While I was attending to Pat, I allowed the horses to\r\nremain loose, as I was sure that they would not wander far.  I had given\r\nup all idea of travelling that day, for Pat was utterly unable to move,\r\nand I felt myself scarcely in a fit state to ride any distance.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the soup was ready I took some in the cup, and having cooled\r\nit in the snow, poured it slowly down Pat's throat.  His eyes seemed to\r\nbe regaining their usual brightness, but yet he did not speak.  Waiting\r\na little I gave him some more, when I heard him say in a low voice,\r\n\"Arrah! now, but that's foine!  Blessings on you, Masther David.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am glad to hear you speak, Pat,\" I said; \"you'll get all to rights in\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\nI next took some of the soup myself, but I cannot say that I admired its\r\nflavour, though it warmed up my inside, and contributed much to restore\r\nmy strength.  I kept the pot on boiling, that I might give Pat more\r\nsoup.\r\n\r\nThus the day wore on, Pat gradually recovering, though as yet he was\r\nunable to give any account of himself.  The expenditure of the lynx\r\nflesh was considerable in making the soup, but I hoped to be able with\r\nPat's gun to shoot some birds, or some other animal, and did not\r\nbegrudge it.\r\n\r\nLeaving Pat asleep, I took his gun and went out to see how the horses\r\nwere getting on, and to gather more sticks for our fire.  I brought in\r\nseveral bundles, and was returning for some more when, almost at the\r\nspot where I had encountered the wolf on the previous evening, it again\r\nmade its appearance, snarling savagely at me.  I should have shouted to\r\nfrighten it away, but I did not wish to awake Pat, as he could not have\r\ncome to my help; so holding the gun ready to fire, I advanced slowly,\r\nwith the same success as before.  When I stood still, so did the wolf.\r\nWhen I moved forward, it retreated.  I was unwilling to fire lest I\r\nshould miss it, and I thought it best to refrain from doing so till it\r\nshould come nearer to me.  At last, to my great satisfaction, it turned\r\nround and bolted off.  So rapidly did it retreat that I had no time to\r\ntake a steady aim at its shoulder, though I lifted my gun for the\r\npurpose of doing so.\r\n\r\n\"I will not let you go another time, my fine fellow,\" I said to myself.\r\n\"If you show your ugly face here again, look out for the consequences.\"\r\n\r\nThe wolf could not have been very hungry, or it would, I suspected, have\r\nattacked the horses; though I have since heard that a single wolf will\r\nseldom attempt to kill a horse, a pair of heels proving more formidable\r\nweapons than its fangs.\r\n\r\nHaving collected enough wood, I returned to the hut.  Pat was in the\r\nsame semi-conscious state as before, still he appeared to me to be\r\ngetting better, and I hoped that by the next day he would be\r\nsufficiently recovered to set off with me towards the fort.  I watched\r\nhim anxiously for some time, wishing, should he awake, to give him some\r\nmore broth.  Finding that he slept on, I was compelled by sheer\r\ndrowsiness and fatigue to lie down, when I myself was soon fast asleep.\r\nWhen I awoke, I found him sitting up and scratching his head.\r\n\r\n\"Arrah! now, what's it all about?\" he muttered.  \"Shure I've been\r\ndhrameing.  I thought I was out riding along in the snow.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope you feel better, Pat,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"For the matter of that, I'm mighty ager after some mate, for I do not\r\nknow when I last put some between my grinders,\" he answered.\r\n\r\n\"If you wait a bit, you shall soon have some broth,\" I said, seeing that\r\nhe was still weak and scarcely himself.  \"Lie down, and I'll get it\r\nready for you.\"\r\n\r\nI quickly warmed some broth, as I had promised, and brought it to him.\r\nHe eagerly swallowed it, and asked for more.  This I had not to give\r\nhim, but I promised if he would go to sleep again that I would get some\r\nready for the morning.  I accordingly cut off some more meat, and\r\nputting it into the pot, filled it up with snow.  I then put the pot on\r\nthe fire, and sat inside the hut watching it while it was boiling.\r\n\r\nThe occupation kept me awake.  As I was looking out into the darkness\r\nbeyond the fire, I fancied that I saw a shadowy form gliding by.  It\r\nwas, I suspected, that of the wolf, which had been attracted by the\r\nscent of the boiling meat.\r\n\r\nThe creature was afraid of approaching the fire, or I should soon have\r\nhad the contents of my pot carried off.  I got Pat's gun, and having\r\nwithdrawn the charge and carefully reloaded it, I placed it by my side,\r\nto be ready for use.\r\n\r\nNow and then the wolf got near enough to show me its glaring eyeballs,\r\nand several times I was greatly tempted to fire, to try to kill it, but\r\nI did not wish to throw a shot away; and, should I miss, the bullet\r\nmight find its way towards one of our horses, which were feeding at some\r\ndistance beyond.\r\n\r\nAt last, on my throwing some more sticks on the fire, which made it\r\nblaze up brightly, the wolf scampered off.  My cooking kept me awake the\r\nremainder of the night, and I had some strong broth ready for Pat in the\r\nmorning.  It had a flavour of its own which would have been much better\r\nfor some salt and pepper, not to speak of a few vegetables; but as they\r\nwere not to be procured, we had to take it as it was.  Pat, as before,\r\npronounced it \"mighty foine.\"  Though it evidently did him good, he\r\nshowed no inclination to get up and exert himself.  To my regret,\r\nindeed, I found that he was still very weak, and had not entirely\r\nrecovered his senses.\r\n\r\nI had, therefore, to make up my mind to stay in the hut another day.  To\r\nleave him in that state was impossible, and I was scarcely in a fit\r\ncondition to set out alone, though I should have done so had I not found\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe weather was tolerably warm, and the snow was diminishing in depth,\r\nthough where it went to it was difficult to say.\r\n\r\nPat, evidently getting better as the day drew on, I took his gun and\r\nwent out in the hopes of finding some game to replenish our larder.  The\r\nconstant attack I made on the lynx to supply our broth-pot had greatly\r\ndiminished the flesh on the body.  The first night I had kept it inside\r\nthe hut; but it becoming not over pleasant, I afterwards fastened it to\r\na cross-piece between two high poles, out of the reach of wolves.\r\n\r\nI was not afraid of meeting my old enemy in the daytime, as by slipping\r\na bullet into my gun I could quickly have disposed of him.  I went\r\nsometimes into the wood, and at others kept along just outside it; but\r\nno animals of any description could I meet with, though I fancied I saw\r\nsome deer in the distance.  They did not, however, come near enough to\r\nenable me to be quite certain.  It was possible that I might fall in\r\nwith a buffalo--some solitary bull, perhaps--driven from the herd, but\r\nno traces of one could I see on the snow.  At last, as I was becoming\r\nfatigued and the evening was drawing on, I unwillingly returned to the\r\nhut.\r\n\r\nPat was sitting up, almost himself again.  I fully expected that the\r\nnext day we should be able to start.  Having had some supper, I advised\r\nhim to lie down; but he insisted on sitting up and watching while I took\r\nsome sleep, which I confess I greatly required.\r\n\r\nOn awaking, I saw that he was at the entrance of our hut, kneeling down\r\nwith his gun at his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Hist!\" he said.  \"There's a baste looking in upon us, and I'm just\r\ngoing to make him wish that he hadn't come this way.\"\r\n\r\nBefore I could advise him not to fire he pulled the trigger, and rushing\r\nout I saw my old enemy, the wolf, struggling in the agonies of death on\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\n\"It will give us some mate, at all events, if not the pleasantest food\r\nin the world,\" exclaimed Pat; \"but don't get near his jaws till you are\r\nsure he's dead intirely.\"\r\n\r\nPat had taken good aim, and the animal's struggles were soon over.  I\r\nwent round, and dragged the carcass close to the fire, so that it was\r\nnot likely to be carried off by any of its comrades during the night.\r\nIt was a huge, savage-looking beast, and I thought that I must be very\r\nhard pressed before I could eat its flesh.\r\n\r\nNo other adventure occurred during the night.  Pat, whom I advised to\r\nlie down again, slept on soundly till the morning, when he appeared to\r\nhave almost recovered.  On looking out, I found that our fire had been\r\nextinguished.  The weather was very much warmer, and a slight shower of\r\nrain had fallen, which had tended gradually to decrease the depth of the\r\nsnow.\r\n\r\nWe could not expect a more comfortable time for travelling, and I\r\nproposed that we should at once set out.  Pat got up and tried to walk\r\nabout.\r\n\r\n\"Shure! it's mighty quare I feel,\" he said, \"but if I can but climb on\r\nto the back of my baste, well be able to get along somehow.\"\r\n\r\nOn observing Pat's weakness I felt rather doubtful about this, and saw\r\nthat it was necessary at all events that he should have a good meal\r\nfirst, and that we should have enough to eat on our journey.  The first\r\nthing to be done was to get the fire lighted.  I set to work with some\r\ndried leaves and bark which I had kept inside; but the sticks, being wet\r\nand somewhat green, would not burn up.\r\n\r\n\"Here, Pat! give me a little powder from your powder-horn,\" I cried out.\r\n\r\nIt is customary, I should say, to use it in such cases.  Pat crawled\r\nforward, while I stepped aside to look out for some drier sticks.  What\r\nwas my dismay to see him, instead of handing me the powder, or taking a\r\nlittle out in his hand, uncorking his horn and pouring out the contents\r\non the burning leaves!  Before I could cry out it exploded, blowing all\r\nbefore it, and sending Pat himself sprawling, six feet from where he had\r\nstood, and myself nearly as far.  I lay stunned and senseless for some\r\nminutes.  When I came to my senses, I was seized with the dread that Pat\r\nwas killed.  The fire, I saw, was completely extinguished, and at a\r\ndistance lay Pat.  I got up, and to my surprise ascertained that I had\r\nsuffered no material injury, beyond having my clothes somewhat singed.\r\n\r\nOn reaching Pat, I found that the horn, which he had held in his hand\r\nwhen the powder exploded, was blown to atoms; but, on examining him, I\r\ncould not discover that he had received any wound, nor were his face and\r\nhands even blackened.  While I was looking at him, he opened his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Arrah! now, what's become of the powder?\" he exclaimed, lifting up his\r\nhand, which had held the horn, and gazing at it; \"shure! it's blown to\r\nsmithereens.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed it is, and it's a mercy that you were not killed,\" I said.\r\n\"What could make you do such a thing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Shure! just from not thinking of what I was about,\" he answered,\r\nendeavouring to get on his legs.\r\n\r\nI helping him, he was able to walk back into the hut.  He soon\r\ncompletely recovered, and I sat by his side feeling anything but\r\ncomfortable or happy.\r\n\r\nAs it had turned out, the most serious result of his thoughtlessness was\r\nthe loss of our powder, for not a grain more did we possess.  Though we\r\nhad a gun and shot, they were useless.\r\n\r\n\"It's of no use mourning over our loss,\" I said at length.  \"I'll try\r\nagain to light the fire, and after breakfast we will consider what is\r\nbest to be done.  There is a greater necessity than ever for pushing\r\non.\"\r\n\r\nPat agreed with me in this, and after several efforts I got the fire to\r\nblaze up, boiled some water, and cooked the remainder of our lynx flesh.\r\nUnpalatable as was our food we made a hearty meal, washing it down with\r\nwarm water.  We would have given much for a pinch of salt, and an ounce\r\nof tea, not to speak of sugar and milk.\r\n\r\n\"As we cannot use the gun we must be afther making a weapon instead,\"\r\nobserved Pat.  \"The best thing we can do is to fasten our hunting-knives\r\nto the end of long poles.  They will serve as spears, and enable us with\r\nsome chance of success to defend ourselves against either Indians or\r\nbears or wolves.  We can at any time, if we want to use our knives, take\r\nthem off the poles again.\"\r\n\r\nAs Pat's idea was a good one, we immediately carried it out.  While we\r\nwere shaping the poles, I saw him eyeing the wolf.\r\n\r\n\"We may get some more tasty mate than that baste will give us, but it's\r\njust possible that we may not, and shure it will be wise in us to take\r\nas much as we can carry,\" he said.\r\n\r\nI agreed with him, and before we bound our knives on to the poles we\r\nskinned and cut up the wolf, hanging the hide on to the cross-piece to\r\nwhich the skin of the lynx was suspended.  Pat then chose what he\r\nconsidered the best portions of the animal, leaving the remainder of the\r\ncarcass on the ground.\r\n\r\nIt was time to take another meal before we were ready to start, so we\r\ncooked a piece of the wolf's flesh.  It was tough and unsavoury, but our\r\nteeth being in good condition we managed to masticate a larger portion\r\nthan I should have conceived possible.  I then got the two horses, and,\r\nhaving saddled them, assisted Pat to get on to the back of his.\r\n\r\n\"Forward!\"  I cried, and we moved on; but I saw that Pat sat his saddle\r\nas a sick man does, bending down, and occasionally swaying from side to\r\nside.  I was afraid that he would fall off.\r\n\r\n\"Never fear, Masther David,\" he said, \"I'll catch hold of the mane\r\nbefore it comes to that, and shure I can stick on as well as Dan\r\nO'Rourke when he had got a skinful of the crayther.\"\r\n\r\nWe both of us knew more or less the direction we were to take, but\r\nhaving got out of the route between the forts, the country immediately\r\naround was strange to us.  We went on and on, keeping on the lower\r\nground, and hoping in time to strike the right trail.  Our horses making\r\nno objection, we concluded that we could not be far wrong.\r\n\r\nWe had lost so much time before starting, however, that evening overtook\r\nus before we expected, and we were compelled to camp at the first\r\nsuitable spot we reached.  It was under shelter of a wood with a stream\r\nrunning near it, at which we at once watered our horses.  We then, as\r\ncustomary, took off their saddles and bridles and turned them loose to\r\nfeed.\r\n\r\nThe weather being somewhat threatening, I thought it prudent to build a\r\nhut, both for Pat's sake and my own; and while he, having collected some\r\nsticks, prepared a fire, I set to work to cut the necessary stakes.  It\r\nwas very similar to the one I had before constructed, and as there was\r\nplenty of snow on the ground, I formed the walls of it.\r\n\r\nThe hut would be thus much warmer than if formed merely of branches,\r\nwhich, though affording sufficient protection in summer weather, are not\r\ncalculated to keep out the cold.  The only difference between our\r\npresent and former hut was that the one we had last built was somewhat\r\nlarger, so as to afford accommodation to both of us.\r\n\r\nWe had nothing but the wolf's flesh for supper, and though we tried it\r\nroasted and boiled, in neither state could I manage to eat more that a\r\nvery small quantity.  Pat munched away far more to his satisfaction, if\r\nnot greedily.  It was, perhaps, in consequence of this that he awoke in\r\nthe night complaining of great pain.  The only remedy I could think of\r\nwas hot water.  It somewhat alleviated his sufferings, but in the\r\nmorning he was too ill to proceed.\r\n\r\nHe urged me to go on to the fort, but this I refused to do.  I might be\r\nthree or four days reaching it, or longer, should any untoward\r\ncircumstance occur, and he might be dead before I returned.  This event\r\nmade me feel very much out of spirits.  I was anxious if possible to\r\nprocure better food than the wolf's flesh afforded, so taking my spear I\r\nwent out to try to kill some animal or other.  In vain I searched in\r\nevery direction.  I was tantalised by the sight of birds.  I caught\r\nglimpses of a racoon and a couple of squirrels, but I could not get at\r\nthem.  Had I possessed a charge of powder I might have killed something.\r\n\r\nAt last hunger compelled me to return, and I set to work to cook more of\r\nthe wolf's flesh.  Detestable as I had thought it, I was thankful that\r\nwe possessed even that on which to sustain life.  I was too tired to go\r\nout again; indeed Pat was so ill that I did not like to leave him.\r\n\r\nHaving led the two horses to the stream to drink, I returned with our\r\npot full of water to the hut; then making up the fire, I lay down to\r\nsleep.  On awaking at night I heard the sound of falling snow.  Our fire\r\nwas out, and as it would be a hard matter to relight it, and to keep it\r\nin when alight, I did not make the attempt.\r\n\r\nNext morning, when I looked out, the whole country was a foot or more\r\ndeep in snow.  I turned my eyes in the direction I expected to see the\r\nhorses.  They were nowhere visible.  Still, I hoped that they had only\r\ngone round to the other side of the wood, and would soon return.  Pat\r\nwas rather better.  When I told him that the horses were missing, he\r\nlooked much aghast, and acknowledged that having awakened in the night,\r\nhe had seen several figures like shadowy forms passing in the distance\r\nbefore the hut; but fancying he was dreaming, he had again dropped off\r\nto sleep.\r\n\r\n\"I hope you were dreaming,\" I observed, \"but I shall be more satisfied\r\nwhen I see the horses again.\"\r\n\r\nImmediately after breakfast, taking my trusty spear, I sallied out in\r\nsearch of our steeds, with very little doubt that I should soon find\r\nthem.  Great was my disappointment, therefore, on reaching the place to\r\nwhich I supposed they had gone, not to see them.  I went completely\r\nround the wood and looked up the stream, but not a trace of them could I\r\ndiscover.\r\n\r\nOur condition had been bad before; it was now much worse.  I was\r\nconvinced that Pat had really seen some Indians, who had carried them\r\noff.  We had cause to be thankful that they had not attacked us; perhaps\r\nthey were deterred from the belief that we possessed firearms.  They\r\nknew also that they would not be pursued, as the snow would have\r\ncompletely obliterated their trail?\r\n\r\nHere we then were, several days' journey distant from the fort, without\r\nfirearms, and my companion too ill to walk.  I looked at our store of\r\nwolf flesh, and calculated how many days that would last us.  It would\r\nsoon come to an end, and then what could we do?  Our friends might,\r\nindeed, come in search of us, but the snow almost hid our low hut; and,\r\nunless we had a fire burning, they might pass by without discovering us.\r\n\r\nI pass over the next three days.  Pat got better, but our store of meat\r\ncame to an end.  We had a few bones, which we pounded, and with some\r\nroots which I dug up in the wood I made a kind of broth.  It was more\r\npalatable and nutritious than I could have supposed.\r\n\r\nI proposed going back to our former camp, to fetch the skins of the wolf\r\nand lynx, as they would cut into strips, and boiled, give us sufficient\r\nfood to sustain life.  Pat advised me not to make the attempt.  In the\r\nfirst place he thought that the skins would probably have been carried\r\noff by the Indians, who were sure to have visited our camp; and they\r\nmight be in the neighbourhood, and seeing me alone, might take my scalp\r\nas a trophy of their prowess.  Notwithstanding the limited amount of\r\nunsavoury food we had eaten, I retained my strength, and Pat regained\r\nhis.\r\n\r\nAt last every particle we possessed was consumed.  Notwithstanding the\r\ndanger of marching without food, it was better than remaining where we\r\nwere; and early one morning, with our spears in our hands, Pat carrying\r\nthe saucepan and mug, we started forth.  We had no great fear of\r\nIndians, for should those who stole our horses have wished to kill us,\r\nthey would have done so at once.  They could now track us easily in the\r\nsnow; but this they were not likely to do.\r\n\r\nWe had got to some little distance along the bank of the stream when\r\nPat, who was rather in advance, stopped, and made a sign to me not to\r\nmove, while he pointed ahead.  There I saw several magnificent deer,\r\nwhich had come down to the water to drink.  It would have been a sight\r\nto cheer our hearts had we possessed powder; but in spite of our want of\r\nit, I at once resolved at all hazards to try to kill one of the animals.\r\n\r\nThere were several young ones with them.  We were near a bush, behind\r\nwhich we slipped; then in low voices we arranged our plan of operation.\r\nIt was important to keep to leeward of the deer, or they might have\r\nscented us.\r\n\r\nWe at once crept forward, crouching down and keeping ourselves concealed\r\nby the brushwood.  As we got nearer, we perceived that the animals were\r\nmoose or elk, the largest of the deer tribe, with magnificent thick\r\nantlers.  We well knew the danger of attacking such animals, which\r\ndefend themselves both with these antlers and with their fore feet; with\r\nthe latter they can strike the most terrific blows, sufficient to kill\r\nany assailant.\r\n\r\nStill, hunger made us daring.  Besides the wood through which we were\r\nmaking our way, poplars and several other trees grew in the open ground.\r\n\r\nWe would, if we could have approached them, have attacked one of the\r\nsmaller animals, but they were feeding farther away from our cover, and\r\ntheir mothers would quickly have led them out of our reach.  Close to\r\nthe wood, however, stood a magnificent stag, feeding leisurely, as if\r\nunconscious of the approach of a foe.\r\n\r\nOur plan was to rush out and attack him; and we hoped mortally to wound\r\nhim before he had time to take to flight.  The attempt was a desperate\r\none, but it was worth making.\r\n\r\nWe crept on noiselessly in Indian fashion, stopping every now and then\r\nto be sure that the elk did not see us till we had got within eight or\r\nten yards of him.\r\n\r\n\"Now!\"  I whispered to Pat, and we both sprang up and dashed forward\r\nwith our spears aimed at the elk's breast.\r\n\r\nSo completely surprised was he that he did not even attempt to fly, but\r\nstood staring at us with his large lustrous eyes, till Pat's spear\r\nentered his chest, and I, who was more on the outside, had wounded him\r\nin the shoulder.\r\n\r\nPat, instead of pressing home his spear, withdrew it with the intention\r\nof making another lunge, when the animal started back, and reared on its\r\nhind legs, as if about to strike Pat, who, seeing his danger, leaped\r\nback under cover, calling to me to follow him.  I had no time to do\r\nthis; but hoping that the wound which Pat had inflicted would prove\r\nmortal, ran off to a distance.\r\n\r\nThe elk missed Pat but saw me, and immediately came bounding towards me.\r\nI had barely time to slip behind a thick poplar, when the elk's horns\r\ncame crashing against it.  The animal, apparently, in its fury had not\r\nseen the tree.\r\n\r\nFinding itself stopped, it retreated, when it again caught sight of me,\r\nand made another rush; but, as before, I avoided it by slipping round\r\nthe tree.\r\n\r\nNow it rushed with its antlers against the trunk; now it reared, pawing\r\nwith its feet, one blow from either of which would have laid me low.  My\r\nlife depended on my quickness of sight and agility.  Each time long\r\nstrips of bark were torn off the tree, showing how it would have treated\r\nmy body.\r\n\r\nAgain it retired, to charge in the same way as before.  I hoped that it\r\nwould soon get tired of these performances, but it seemed resolved on my\r\ndestruction.  To mount the tree was impossible, and I dared not turn\r\nround to ascertain what trees were behind me with branches sufficiently\r\nlow to enable me to climb out of the way of the enraged animal.\r\n\r\nPat did not come to my assistance.  I hoped indeed that he would not,\r\nfor the elk would probably have seen him, and would have pierced him\r\nwith its antlers before he would have had a chance of retreating.  I\r\nwas, however, getting very weary of the fearful game I was playing.\r\n\r\nI wanted to ascertain what had become of Pat, but I dared not withdraw\r\nmy eye for a moment from the movements of the elk.  All my energies, all\r\nmy senses were required to escape the dreadful charges it was making.\r\nNow it would rush to one side of the tree, now to the other, while I had\r\nto slip round and round to escape its blows.  Not having my usual\r\nstrength to begin with, I was becoming very tired.\r\n\r\nThere seemed to be no likelihood that my antagonist would give in.  At\r\nlast, I determined at all hazards to carry out the plan I had formed,\r\nand to escape to some tree up which I could climb.  I knew that should\r\nmy foot slip, and I fall to the ground, the elk would in a moment be\r\nupon me.\r\n\r\nI shouted to Pat, telling him what I intended to do, and hoping that he\r\nmight appear and attract, if even but for a few moments, the attention\r\nof the elk.\r\n\r\nSome time elapsed before I could get to the side from which I intended\r\nto take my flight.  I waited for the moment that the deer should make\r\nhis charge against the tree, when, as it would be some seconds before he\r\ndiscovered that he had not caught me, I might have the start of him.\r\n\r\nWith a crash his antlers struck the trunk, and as I heard the sound I\r\ndarted off.  I did not dare to look round to see whether he was\r\nfollowing.  Almost breathless I reached a tree, but it was not one I\r\ncould climb.  As I ran round it, a glance I cast over my shoulder showed\r\nme the savage brute tearing across the open ground in the direction I\r\nhad taken.\r\n\r\nOn I went; another and another tree was passed.  He was nearly up to me,\r\nwhen I saw one a short distance ahead with a branch projecting at a\r\nheight which I could reach.  The elk was close upon my heels when,\r\ngrasping hold of the bough by an effort of which I scarcely supposed\r\nmyself capable, I drew myself up beyond the reach of his antlers, which\r\nthe next instant came crashing against the trunk just below my feet.\r\n\r\nI had no wish, however, to let my antagonist go, and having saved my\r\nspear I resolved to make effectual use of it; so, getting into a\r\nposition between the branches where I could sit securely, I got my\r\nweapon ready for use.\r\n\r\nThe elk having lost me retreated for a few paces, when again catching\r\nsight of me he dashed forward, rearing up on his hind feet.\r\n\r\nWith all the strength I possessed, I darted down my sharp-pointed spear\r\ntowards the top of its head.  I knew that the skull was thick, but that\r\nif my knife would penetrate it, I should certainly kill the elk.  The\r\nblow was more effectual than I had dared to hope for.  The moment the\r\nmoose was struck, down it sank to the ground, without giving a single\r\nstruggle.  I could then for the first time look out to ascertain what\r\nhad become of Pat, shouting as I did so, and presently I saw him rushing\r\nout of the larger wood towards me.\r\n\r\nAs he caught sight of the dead elk, he threw up his hat, exclaiming,\r\n\"Hurrah! good luck to you, Masther David!  Erin go bragh!  We'll not be\r\nafther starving at any rate.\"\r\n\r\nOn seeing him coming I descended from my perch.  We greeted each other\r\nwith a hearty shake of the hands, as if we had been long absent.  We\r\nlost no time in skinning our game, cutting out the tongue, and as large\r\na portion of the haunch as we could carry.\r\n\r\nHaving prepared our loads, I was about to set off, when Pat exclaimed,\r\n\"Stay, Masther David; before we are back, the wolves or vultures will\r\nhave got hould of our mate.  It's more than they desarve, the varmints.\"\r\n\r\nSaying this, he carefully cut away the inside of the animal, and drew\r\nforth a large bladder, which he emptied of its contents, and then blew\r\ninto it till it was inflated to the full.  He then secured it by a thin\r\nline drawn from the intestines, which he fastened to a branch overhead,\r\nso that it hung vibrating in the breeze over the carcass, glittering\r\nbrightly as it slowly moved to and fro.\r\n\r\n\"That will keep the bastes away till we come back,\" he observed.\r\n\r\nI rather doubted, however, the success of the experiment.  We at once\r\nreturned to our camp, where we left our pot and Pat's useless gun, and\r\nthe few other articles we had brought with us.  We soon got a fire\r\nlighted, and our venison cooked, and a very hearty meal we made.\r\n\r\nHaving secured the meat inside the hut, before which we left the fire\r\nblazing, we returned for a further supply, as we intended to dry enough\r\nto last us for the time we should take to reach the fort.\r\n\r\nAs we approached the spot we saw numerous birds seated on the branches\r\nof the surrounding trees, and at a short distance a dozen at least of\r\nthe smaller prairie-wolves.  Both one and the other were evidently\r\nscared by the glittering balloon.\r\n\r\nOur shouts prevented the wolves from approaching, and allowed us plenty\r\nof time to obtain a further supply of venison.  More we could not have\r\ncarried with us even when dried, so we left the remainder of the carcass\r\nto the birds and beasts of prey, who would certainly, after sunset,\r\npounce upon it.\r\n\r\nOur first care on arriving at our camp was to cut the venison which we\r\ndid not require for immediate use into thin strips.  These we proposed\r\ndrying in the sun and smoke, and then packing in as small a space as\r\npossible to carry on our backs.\r\n\r\nThankful for our preservation, we lay down that night to sleep, hoping\r\nthat nothing would prevent us from continuing our journey on the\r\nfollowing morning.  Eager as we were to proceed, we agreed that it would\r\nbe wiser to spend another day in preparing our meat and recruiting our\r\nstrength, for though both of us were much recovered, we were not fit for\r\na long tramp, with the fatigue at the end of the day's journey of\r\nbuilding a hut and collecting wood for our fire.\r\n\r\nWe were very busy all day smoking the venison and drying it in the sun,\r\nthe heat of which was still sufficient for our object.  We could hear\r\nthe wolves during the night wrangling over the carcass of the deer, but\r\nthey did not pay us a visit.  As they would have had sufficient food, we\r\ndid not fear that they would attack us; should they do so, we were\r\nprepared to receive them with our sharp spears.\r\n\r\nThe morning of our departure arrived.  Breakfasting on the remainder of\r\nour fresh venison, we did up our provisions in two packs, including our\r\nother articles; and with our spear-handles as staffs, we set forward on\r\nour journey in good spirits.\r\n\r\nWe had met with many dangers, and surmounted them all; and we hoped\r\nthat, should we have more to encounter, we might be preserved by the\r\nsame merciful Providence which had hitherto watched over us.  My chief\r\nanxiety now was about what had happened to Sandy and Pierre; still,\r\nthoroughly well acquainted with the country as they were, and accustomed\r\nto emergencies of all sorts, I hoped that long before this they would\r\nhave made their way home.  Pat could give no account of them.  He had\r\nbeen separated from them as I was in the snowstorm, and had ridden on,\r\nnot knowing where he was going.  Had I not found him, he would\r\nundoubtedly have perished.\r\n\r\nWe trudged on manfully all day, stopping only for a short time about\r\nnoon to eat a portion of the cold venison which we had cooked, so that\r\nthere was no necessity for lighting a fire till we reached our\r\ncamping-ground at night.\r\n\r\nHad we possessed more clothing we should have been saved the trouble of\r\nbuilding a hut; but as we had only our horse-cloths to put over our\r\nshoulders, we were afraid of suffering from the cold should we sleep in\r\nthe open air.\r\n\r\nWe marched straight forward without even looking for game, as we had\r\nfood enough, and were unwilling to lose any time.  Our belief was that\r\nwe were directing our course exactly for the fort, but, after marching\r\non for four days, I began to have some uncomfortable misgivings on the\r\nsubject.  We might have kept too much to the south and passed it, for\r\nthe snow covered up the slight trail which existed, and we had only the\r\ngeneral appearance of the country to go by.\r\n\r\nI had never led a party, having trusted to Sandy or others, and\r\ntherefore had not sufficiently noted the landmarks.  I now bitterly\r\nregretted my carelessness, and resolved in future to note for myself, on\r\nevery journey, the most remarkable points, so that I might, when alone,\r\nbe able to find my way.\r\n\r\n\"Shure! the fort's a mighty dale furder off than I thought for,\"\r\nobserved Pat, as we were forming our camp on the evening of the fifth\r\nday.\r\n\r\nI then told him my own apprehensions.  He looked somewhat uncomfortable.\r\n\r\n\"But we have still got some venison in our packs, and must try back, I\r\nsuppose,\" he said.  \"I can think of no other course to take.\"\r\n\r\nAfter we had fixed up our hut, we had a serious talk as to what was best\r\nto be done.  I proposed going northward, and endeavouring to reach a\r\nbranch of the Upper Saskatchewan, on the bank of which our fort was\r\nsituated, as by following the stream up or down we must eventually come\r\nupon it.\r\n\r\nThis was, indeed, our only safe plan, and we determined next morning to\r\npursue it.  Darkness had come on.  We were engaged in cooking our\r\nsupper--roasting a portion and boiling some of the dried venison to\r\nserve as a beverage.  We had had no time to dig for roots during our\r\njourney, but as soon as we halted, while I was preparing the fire, Pat\r\nwent into the wood to search for some.  He brought in a large\r\nhandkerchief full, but, as we were very hungry, we agreed that we would\r\nwait until the next morning to cook them for breakfast, as they would\r\nrequire a good deal of boiling.  We therefore piled them up on one side,\r\nthat we might peel and prepare them after supper.\r\n\r\nI was stirring the pot, when, looking beyond the flames, I caught sight\r\nof the figure of a man slowly approaching.  The light falling on him\r\nshowed me that he was an Indian.  He held a bow in his hand, and a\r\nquiver of arrows was at his back.\r\n\r\n\"Hillo! some one is coming,\" I exclaimed to Pat, who was lying down, and\r\ndid not therefore see the Indian, and was probably not seen himself.\r\n\r\nPat started up, and mechanically placed his hand on his gun, which was\r\nlying near him, forgetting that it was unloaded.\r\n\r\nThe Indian must have observed the action, but without taking notice of\r\nit, he quickly came up and stood opposite to us on the other side of the\r\nfire.\r\n\r\n\"Whaugh!\" exclaimed the stranger, in a tone of surprise, looking at Pat\r\nand me.  \"I did not expect to find white men here, at this time of the\r\nyear.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who are you?\"  I asked.\r\n\r\n\"I am Miskwandib, and wish to be your friend,\" answered the Indian.  \"At\r\npresent I am hungry, and should be glad of food.  Had I been an enemy I\r\ncould have killed you both with my arrows at a distance, and taken what\r\nI require.\"\r\n\r\n\"Much obliged to you, friend Miskwandib, for your kindness,\" said Pat.\r\n\"Sit down, and make yourself at home, and you shall have some of our\r\nsupper.\"  Pat spoke partly in English and partly in the Cree language.\r\n\r\nThe Indian understood him, and coming round to our side of the fire sat\r\ndown next to Pat.  We immediately handed him some of the venison, which\r\nhe ate ravenously, while I put on a fresh piece to roast.  It greatly\r\ndiminished our stock of provisions, but we could not withhold it from\r\nthe starving Indian.\r\n\r\n\"Have you any friends in the neighbourhood, Misther Miskwandib?\" asked\r\nPat.\r\n\r\n\"I have my squaw and children encamped at the farther end of the wood,\"\r\nhe answered.  \"They, too, are starving and want food.  They nearly\r\nperished in the snowstorm which occurred some time back, and since then\r\nI have been unable to kill any game for their support.  You with your\r\nfirearms will be able to obtain what you may require.\"\r\n\r\nWe, of course, did not wish to say that we had no powder, or that I had\r\nnot even a gun.  Pat and I, after a short consultation, agreed that\r\nhumanity demanded we should share our provisions with the starving\r\nIndians.\r\n\r\nWhile we were talking, the Indian's eye fell upon the roots by Pat's\r\nside.\r\n\r\n\"What are these for?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Shure! to cook and ate,\" answered Pat.\r\n\r\n\"If you eat these roots, before many hours are over you will be dead\r\nmen,\" exclaimed the Indian, taking them up one after another, and\r\nthrowing them to a distance, reserving only four or five of a different\r\nspecies from the rest.  \"These are wholesome, if you boil them\r\nsufficiently; they are such as my family and I have lived on for many\r\ndays past.\"\r\n\r\nBeing assured that the Indian spoke the truth, we thanked him for the\r\ntimely warning he had given us.  We now did up the larger portion of\r\nwhat remained of our meat, reserving only enough for the following day,\r\nand giving it to him, asked if he knew Fort Black, and would agree to\r\nguide us to it.  He seemed somewhat surprised at our liberality, and\r\nreplied that if we would wait a day or two, till his family were fit to\r\ntravel, he would show us the direct way to it.  We understood from him\r\nthat it was some distance off.\r\n\r\nI replied that, as our friends were expecting us, we wished to set off\r\nat once, and that if he would point out the direction of the fort we\r\ncould find our way alone.\r\n\r\n\"As such is your resolution, may the Good Spirit guide you!  I cannot\r\nleave my family, and they will be unable to travel for two days at\r\nleast.\"  Saying this, he got up and drew a line on the ground pointing\r\nto the north-east.  \"That is the direction you must follow,\" he said.\r\n\"In three days you will reach the fort.\"\r\n\r\nWe knew by this that we had gone too far to the westward, and not\r\nsufficiently to the north.  We hoped that now we should be able to make\r\nour way.  We were thankful to think that we had only two nights more to\r\nstop out, and unless the weather changed very much for the worse we were\r\nnot likely to suffer.\r\n\r\nThe Indian having done up the meat we had given him, without expressing\r\nany gratitude took his departure, and was soon lost to sight in the\r\ngloom.\r\n\r\n\"Miskwandib! that's the name of the `red head' or `copper-snake',\" I\r\nobserved.  \"What do you think of our friend, Pat?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't altogether trust him,\" he answered.  \"He may be an honest man\r\nand have told us the truth; but he may be a rogue and mean us harm,\r\nnotwithstanding all he said.\"\r\n\r\n\"He might have shot us with his arrows had he been so inclined,\" I\r\nanswered, \"and at all events he did us a great service in warning us of\r\nthe poisonous character of the roots you dug up.  I feel pretty sure,\r\ntoo, that he pointed out the right direction to the fort.\"\r\n\r\nStill Pat was not convinced of the honesty of Miskwandib.  He was never\r\nvery friendly to the Indians, and certainly begrudged parting with so\r\nmuch of our venison, though ready to do as I wished.\r\n\r\nWe sat up for some time, half expecting another visit from the Indian;\r\nbut we did not see him, and at length lay down to sleep, Pat promising\r\nto keep one eye open, in case he should steal into our camp and help\r\nhimself to the remainder of our venison.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THREE.\r\n\r\nOUR LAST FRAGMENTS OF MEAT ARE CONSUMED--FORTUNATE DISCOVERY OF A FLASK\r\nOF POWDER--PAT'S LASSO--THE MADDENED BUFFALO BULL--PAT'S LASSO IS TURNED\r\nTO USEFUL ACCOUNT--BUFFALO TONGUES ROASTED--PAT'S \"IRISH\"--OUR BUFFALO\r\nMEAT BECOMING EXHAUSTED, WE ARE SADLY IN WANT OF FOOD--PAT'S STRANGE\r\nBEHAVIOUR--HIS MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE WITH THE GUN--I GO IN SEARCH OF\r\nHIM--FAILING TO FIND HIM, I AM OVERJOYED AT MEETING BOUNCER--THE \"BULL\r\nBOAT,\" OR PARCHMENT CANOE--SHOOTING RAPIDS--BLACK FORT ONCE MORE--SANDY\r\nAND PIERRE'S ADVENTURES--OUR YOUNG-LADY VISITORS, ROSE AND LETTY--THE\r\nMEAT PIT.\r\n\r\n\"Copper-Snake\" did not return during the night, nor did we the next\r\nmorning see anything of him; we therefore packed up, and began our tramp\r\nin the direction he had pointed out.\r\n\r\nThe sky had hitherto been clear, but the clouds now began to spread over\r\nit, though there was scarcely a breath of air.  In a short time the sun\r\nwas so obscured that it no longer enabled us to steer our course.  We\r\nhad marked a hill, however, in the distance, and marched on guided by\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe hill was of less height and not so far off as we supposed, and when\r\nwe had crossed it, we could fix on no object to serve as a mark.\r\nNotwithstanding this, we kept straight on till we came to a stream.  We\r\nthen had to make our way for some distance down it till we could find a\r\nford.  Though the water was very cold, by taking off our shoes and\r\ntrousers we waded across without wetting our clothes.\r\n\r\nWe were unable to decide in what direction the stream ran, and crossing\r\nit somewhat confused us.  It might, Pat argued, be running north, or\r\nnorth-west, and still fall into the Saskatchewan, or be running east.\r\n\r\nNeither the appearance of the sky nor the wind served in any way to\r\nguide us.  At last we were obliged to camp, as neither of us had\r\nstrength to go farther.  By the next evening we had exhausted, with the\r\nexception of a few mouthfuls, the whole of our stock of dried venison,\r\nbut as we hoped during the next day to reach the fort, we agreed that we\r\ncould manage to keep body and soul together with the little which\r\nremained; still, I did not feel very comfortable.  The idea would\r\nintrude, that \"Copper-Snake\" might have misled us, or that we had\r\nwandered out of our course.  If so, we should be very hard pressed for\r\nfood, or death by starvation might after all be our fate.  I remembered\r\ntoo the anxiety my brother Alick would be enduring about me.\r\n\r\nThere were in the neighbourhood others who, should they hear that we\r\nwere missing, would be greatly concerned about us.  Some way off,\r\nfarther to the westward, at the foot of the hills, was a missionary\r\nstation, of which a Mr Crisp had charge.  His two children, Martin and\r\nRose, were great friends of ours.\r\n\r\nIn the winter, when we could travel over the country on sleighs, we\r\nfrequently paid them a visit at the missionary station, which, in the\r\nsummer, when the river was full, we could reach in a canoe, by making\r\nthree or four portages past the rapids.\r\n\r\nMartin was rather younger than I was, and Rose was somewhat older.  She\r\nwas a sensible, clever girl, and we were all much attached to her and\r\nher brother.\r\n\r\nMr Meredith, who had charge of Fort Ross, had a daughter, Letty.  I\r\nadmired her very much.  She was a fair, blue-eyed little girl, just a\r\ncouple of years younger than me, and I would have gone through fire and\r\nwater to serve her.\r\n\r\nI was much disappointed at not finding her at Fort Ross, for she had\r\nbeen spending the summer with Mr and Mrs Crisp, for the purpose of\r\nreceiving instruction with Rose from Mrs Crisp, who was a highly\r\neducated lady.\r\n\r\nMr Meredith looked a little more careworn than usual.  Reports had been\r\nbrought him that a large party of Sioux had made an incursion into our\r\nterritory, and it was not known in what direction they had gone.  He had\r\nadvised us to keep constant watch, and to push forward as fast as our\r\nhorses could move.\r\n\r\nShould Sandy and Pierre not have returned to Fort Black, I felt\r\nconfident that Alick would send to Fort Ross to ascertain when we had\r\nset out, and to obtain assistance in searching for us.\r\n\r\nRemembering, however, that it was wrong to indulge in anticipations of\r\nevil when we had already been so mercifully taken care of, I succeeded\r\nin putting away my anxious thoughts.\r\n\r\nThe next day was like the past.  The sky was clouded; there was not a\r\nbreath of air, and we had no certain means of knowing in what direction\r\nwe were proceeding.  We ate the last fragments of meat we possessed,\r\nbefore starting, to give us strength for the journey.\r\n\r\nOn we went, but still I was unable to recognise any of the features of\r\nthe country.  Noon approached, and we were getting desperately hungry.\r\nAfter the danger we had run of being poisoned by the roots Pat had dug\r\nup, we were afraid of trying others, for neither of us was certain which\r\nwere wholesome and which poisonous, they both looked so much alike.\r\n\r\nWe were passing the border of a small wood, when Pat gave a shout.\r\n\r\n\"It's my belafe there's the remains of a camp-fire,\" he exclaimed,\r\npointing to a spot a little distance off.\r\n\r\nWe hurried towards it.  There was a black spot round which the snow had\r\nbeen scraped away, and near it was a pile of sticks, but none of the\r\nembers remained, the ashes having apparently been blown away by the\r\nwind.  There were marks of several feet around, in all directions, which\r\nmade us suppose that the party had been a numerous one.\r\n\r\nI was looking about when my eye fell on a small object, almost covered\r\nby the snow.\r\n\r\nI ran towards it.  It was a powder-flask!\r\n\r\nEagerly I pulled out the cork.  It was almost full.\r\n\r\n\"Here's a prize, Pat!\"  I exclaimed, holding it up.\r\n\r\n\"Thank Heaven for it,\" cried Pat.  \"We shall now be able to shoot any\r\nbird or baste we catch sight of, but it is a bad lookout for whoever\r\nleft it behind.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think it tells a tale,\" I answered.  \"The party, whoever they were,\r\nmust have hurried away--perhaps from the appearance of a body of\r\nIndians, or they might have gone off in chase of some deer or\r\nbuffaloes.\"\r\n\r\n\"If that was so, no one would have left his powder-horn behind,\"\r\nobserved Pat.  \"It's my belafe they took to flight to escape from\r\nIndians.  It must have been in the daytime, for there are no pieces of\r\nbark about, or any signs of a night encampment; but how the Indians came\r\nto miss the powder-flask is more than I can say.  Let me look at it.\"\r\nHe examined the flask carefully, as I had been doing.\r\n\r\n\"It's my belafe,\" he said, \"that it does not belong to any of the people\r\nof the fort.  My idea is that a party of white men have come over the\r\nRocky Mountains by Jasper House, and have stopped here on their way\r\neastward, intending to reach Fort a la Corne, or Fort Pelly, farther\r\nsouth, though I doubt, unless they can procure sleighs, if they will get\r\nthere this winter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be that as it may, the powder-flask is a God-send to us,\" I said; \"and\r\nI hope that the owner will not be the worse without it.  At all events,\r\nlet us load your rifle to be ready for any animal which may come across\r\nour path.\"\r\n\r\nWe searched about for any other treasure which might have been left\r\nbehind, but could discover nothing in the immediate neighbourhood of the\r\nfire.\r\n\r\nIt would be useless to stop where we were, so taking it for granted that\r\nthe fugitives had gone eastward, we continued on at right-angles to\r\ntheir trail.\r\n\r\nWe had not gone far when, crossing a piece of meadow, where from its\r\nexposure the snow had almost disappeared, Pat cried out, \"There is\r\nsomething else worth having;\" and, darting forward, he lifted up a long\r\nlasso composed of buffalo hide.  One end had been cut, the other was\r\nfixed into the ground by an iron stake with a ring.\r\n\r\n\"The owner of this must have mounted his horse in a desperate hurry, and\r\ncut him free,\" he observed.  \"If the Indians had taken him, they would\r\nhave carried off the lasso and stake.  We shall hear more about this\r\nsome day; but I only hope the whites got safe off.\"\r\n\r\nCoiling up the lasso with the stake, Pat hung it over his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"If any buffalo are in the neighbourhood, they are likely to visit this\r\nmeadow,\" he observed; \"and if we see any, won't we--\" And he made signs\r\nof biting away with his teeth so furiously that I could not help\r\nlaughing at his grimaces.\r\n\r\n\"Come! that's right, Masther David.  It's a great thing to keep up one's\r\nspirits, especially on an empty stomach.\"\r\n\r\nWe were proceeding along the edge of a wood which bordered the meadow,\r\nwhen we caught sight of several dark spots.  By keeping close under the\r\ntrees we got still nearer to them, when to our infinite satisfaction we\r\ndiscovered that they were buffaloes.\r\n\r\nSo busily were they feeding that they did not see us, but they were\r\nstill too far out from the cover to allow us to get a shot at one of\r\nthem; starving as we were, it was a matter of the greatest importance\r\nnot to allow them to escape.\r\n\r\nIn summer, with proper precautions, when the grass was long, we might\r\nhave managed to creep over the ground without being discovered by the\r\nanimals, but with the white mantle which now lay on the ground we should\r\nbe certain to be seen.\r\n\r\nWe remained hid behind some bushes, Pat's mouth watering with the\r\nthoughts of the buffalo meat he hoped to obtain, and my hand trembling\r\nwith anxiety.  Though we could not approach the animals, they might draw\r\nnearer to us.  We were still waiting in the expectation of their doing\r\nthis, when another buffalo appeared on the scene, and bellowing loudly\r\napproached the herd.  They retreated towards the wood, but still at a\r\ndistance from where we were, when a bull advanced from among them to\r\nmeet the newcomer.  The latter bellowed still more loudly, and was\r\nanswered by his antagonist.\r\n\r\nIn another minute the horns of the two animals were crashing furiously\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n\"Now is our time,\" I cried, and rushing forward with Pat's gun in my\r\nhand, I approached the combatants.  Pat followed, keeping somewhat to\r\nthe right of me.\r\n\r\nI had got to within about thirty yards of the two animals, who were\r\nmoving about now on one side and now on the other with the greatest\r\nrapidity, so that it would not be very easy, I knew, to hit a vital\r\npart.\r\n\r\nDropping on my knee, that I might take a steadier aim, I raised my rifle\r\nand fired at one of the buffaloes, which at that moment presented its\r\nside to me.  It was in the act of making a rush at its opponent, but\r\nfell before their horns met, when the other immediately rushed at it,\r\nleaping over the prostrate body of its foe.\r\n\r\nI was about to reload my rifle, when the victorious buffalo caught sight\r\nof Pat and me, and throwing up the snow with its hoofs, and bellowing\r\nwith rage, it dashed towards us.\r\n\r\n\"Run for a tree! run for a tree!\" cried Pat, \"or the baste will be upon\r\nus;\" and suiting the action to the word, he made towards one at no great\r\ndistance off.  I, following his example, ran in the direction of one\r\nwhich appeared somewhat nearer to me.  As I began to move, I felt\r\nsomething slip from my fingers.  It was my powder-flask!  Fortunately I\r\nhad not yet withdrawn the cork.  I had to run as fast as I had been\r\ncompelled to do when escaping from the elk, with the bellowing buffalo\r\nclose to my heels.\r\n\r\nI had barely time to swing myself into the tree, when the enraged animal\r\nwas up to me.\r\n\r\nThe buffalo dashed forward for some paces, when, not seeing me in front,\r\nit turned up its eyes and espied me a few feet only above its head; on\r\nthis it made a furious charge at the tree, which shook so that I feared\r\nit would be uprooted or broken off by the force of its blows.\r\n\r\nI shouted to Pat to make a diversion in my favour.\r\n\r\n\"I'll do it if I have the chance,\" he answered; \"but why don't you shoot\r\nthe baste?\"\r\n\r\nI told him that I had lost my powder-horn, and that my rifle was\r\nunloaded.\r\n\r\nAll this time the buffalo was going round and round the tree, charging\r\nat it, now on one side, now on the other.  This it continued doing for\r\nwhat appeared to me a very long time.\r\n\r\nSometimes it retired to a short distance, but it was to return again\r\nwith its rage seemingly increased.\r\n\r\nThe tree, which was but a large sapling, trembled to the very roots, and\r\nI had to hold on tightly to escape being shaken off.\r\n\r\nI entreated Pat to shout, and try to attract the attention of the savage\r\nbrute.\r\n\r\nAt last I saw him descending from his tree, and approaching cautiously,\r\nin an attitude which showed that he was ready at any moment to beat a\r\nrapid retreat.  As he got nearer, he began to shout at the top of his\r\nvoice, clapping his hands.  Then he took out a red handkerchief and\r\nwaved it.  The buffalo did not at first observe him, but as soon as it\r\ncaught sight of the red handkerchief, with a loud bellow it went\r\ncharging my companion at headlong speed, with its horns close to the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nPat lost not a moment in scampering off, but he had only just time to\r\nreach the tree, and to climb up onto the bough from which he had\r\ndescended, when the buffalo's horns struck the trunk just below his\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\n\"It will be all right now, Masther David,\" shouted Pat; \"don't be afther\r\nthroubling yourself more about the matter.\"\r\n\r\nAs he said this I saw that he was uncoiling his lasso, and forming a\r\nnoose at the end.  He then took his seat on the bough in an attitude\r\nwhich would enable him to throw it with certainty.\r\n\r\nThe buffalo, however, was not to be so easily caught.  Again and again\r\nit retreated, charging up to the tree, and rushing round it, without\r\naffording Pat an opportunity of letting the noose drop over its head.\r\n\r\nAt last the animal came close under where Pat was sitting.  He dropped\r\nthe noose, and giving the lasso a jerk, brought it over the animal's\r\nhorns and completely round its neck.\r\n\r\nNo sooner did the buffalo find itself adorned with this somewhat tight\r\ncravat--an article of dress to which it was not accustomed--than it\r\nbegan to pull away with all its might; but of course the harder it\r\nhauled the tighter became the noose, till, almost strangled, it rushed\r\ntowards the tree with the idea, apparently, that it would thus be able\r\nto liberate itself.\r\n\r\n\"Now's your time, Masther David,\" cried Pat; \"you can pick up your\r\npowder-horn and soon settle with the baste.\"\r\n\r\nSlipping from the tree, I hurried towards where I had dropped the\r\npowder-horn, guided by the traces of my feet; and recovering it,\r\nimmediately reloaded my rifle.  Pat shouted to me to make haste, as he\r\nwas afraid that the buffalo would break loose.  I, of course, was not\r\nlikely to delay longer than I could help.  Stopping within a dozen paces\r\nof the buffalo, which eyed me as I approached, I lifted my rifle to my\r\nshoulder, and fired.\r\n\r\nThe buffalo, a moment before bellowing with rage and exhibiting its\r\nmighty strength, at that instant sank down to the ground; and before\r\nPat, who had slipped from the tree, had time to plunge his hunting-knife\r\ninto its throat, the monster was dead.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the buffaloes had taken to flight, leaving us masters\r\nof the field and in possession of two fine animals.  We had, therefore,\r\nonly to cut off the humps and extract the tongues, which are considered\r\nthe most delicate morsels, intending, however, to secure a larger\r\nportion as soon as we had satisfied our hunger.  Choosing a spot close\r\nto the trees where we were completely sheltered from the wind, we\r\nspeedily lighted a fire, and had one of the tongues roasting before it.\r\nThe effect of a hearty meal was very satisfactory.  Both of us found our\r\nstrength restored and our spirits rise, as we now felt sure that we\r\nshould have food enough to last us till we could reach the fort, even\r\nshould it be farther off than we had supposed.\r\n\r\nHaving cut off and packed up as much buffalo meat as we could carry, we\r\nproceeded on our journey, intending not to stop till nightfall.  Though\r\nwe had a good load on our backs we trudged along merrily.  The air was\r\npure, and though the cold was considerable we did not feel it while in\r\nexercise.  At night, though we had not much to cover us, we were able to\r\nkeep ourselves warm before a blazing fire.  Had we enjoyed sufficient\r\ntime, we might have skinned the buffaloes and made two robes which would\r\nhave formed sufficient bed-covering, even during the hardest frost; but\r\nof course we could not delay for this purpose--besides which, we should\r\nhave been unwilling to add them to our loads.\r\n\r\nFrom every height we reached we looked out eagerly, hoping to see the\r\nfort or a portion of the river which flowed by it.  Twice we caught\r\nsight of Indian wigwams in the far distance, but we avoided them, not\r\nknowing whether the inhabitants might prove friends or foes.  In either\r\ncase they would be sure to deprive us of our buffalo meat and perhaps of\r\nour lives.\r\n\r\nCould we have been certain that they would prove friendly, it might have\r\nbeen worthwhile to sacrifice our provisions for the sake of being guided\r\nto the fort, with the road to which they would be well acquainted.  We\r\ntook care not to encamp till we had got to a good distance from the\r\nwigwams we had last seen, as the smoke of our fire might betray us.\r\n\r\n\"Shure! before the sun sets this day we shall reach the fort,\" observed\r\nPat, as we were preparing to start after our breakfast; but the sun did\r\nnot appear in the sky, or rather the clouds obscured it, and we had no\r\ncertain means of directing our course.\r\n\r\nAs I said before, an Indian or an experienced white hunter would have\r\nbeen quite independent of the sun, being able to tell to a certainty the\r\npoints of the compass by the appearance of the bark on the trees, or\r\nmoss on rocks, or many other signs of which both Pat and I were\r\nignorant.\r\n\r\nI had only lately returned from school in Canada, and Pat, though a\r\ncapital follower, was not born to be a leader.  He did not possess the\r\ngift of observation, and like many another Irishman was always making\r\nthe most curious mistakes.  I should never have been surprised when he\r\nwas loading his gun had he put in the shot first and the powder\r\nafterwards; and a story was told of him that, having forgotten to put\r\nany powder in the pan of his lock, each time that his gun missed fire he\r\nadded a fresh charge; and when at length he did prime his piece, and\r\nfiring, it went off knocking him down, he jumped up exclaiming, \"Hurrah!\r\nshure, that's only one charge!  There's five more to come presently.\"\r\n\r\nStill Pat was a faithful fellow, and did his best; which must be allowed\r\nwas much in his favour, so that he was a favourite with every one--\r\nFrench voyageurs, English trappers, and half-breeds.\r\n\r\n\"I do hope we shall reach the fort before to-night,\" I answered to his\r\nlast remark.\r\n\r\n\"Shure! if we do not, we've got mate enough to last us for a week.  If\r\nour shoes don't give out, we will have no raison to complain at all at\r\nall,\" he exclaimed.\r\n\r\nI little thought at the time he spoke that a whole week would pass by,\r\nand that even then we should be as far as ever, for what we could tell,\r\nfrom the fort.  Had the sky been clear we could have proceeded in a\r\nstraight line, but obscured as it remained, we, I felt sure, made many a\r\ncircuit, though we did not exactly hit on our former camp-fires.\r\n\r\nThe snow at this period of the year, just before the early winter set\r\nin, rapidly disappeared, so that the marks of our footsteps were\r\nobliterated.  Sometimes, as we trudged on, I felt as if I was in a\r\ntroubled dream, aiming at a point and never able to reach it.\r\n\r\nThe end of the week came; our buffalo meat was nearly exhausted, and we\r\nsaw neither deer nor any other animals.  Though for the past two days we\r\nhad husbanded our store, it came to an end at last, and we were as badly\r\noff as we had been before.  Our shoes were worn out, our clothes torn,\r\nthough we still, with a sufficiency of food, should have had strength to\r\ngo on.  Even Pat lost his spirits, and he neither sang nor talked as\r\nbefore.  I felt ashamed of myself at having been unable to find my way,\r\nwhen I thought that I should have no difficulty in doing so.\r\n\r\nNight was approaching, and we must encamp without a particle of food to\r\nrestore our strength.  Frost had set in that day, and the cold before\r\nmorning might become very severe.  Tired though we were, to prevent\r\nourselves from perishing we must light a good fire.\r\n\r\nAt last we reached a wood, and immediately setting to work, collected\r\nall the sticks we could find.  We had no time to build a hut, and all we\r\ncould do was to put up a few slabs of birch-bark close to the fire,\r\ncreep in under them, and go supperless to bed.\r\n\r\nI could not sleep for thinking of our dreary prospects.  Pat's manner\r\ntoo during the day had been very unusual, and caused me much anxiety:\r\nthe hardships we were enduring were evidently beginning to tell on him.\r\nStrange to say, though I was so much younger, I bore them better than he\r\ndid.  Pat, I must confess, at times had been too fond of \"the crayther,\"\r\nwhich had, I concluded, somewhat weakened his constitution.  He\r\nfrequently did not appear to know what we were doing or where we were\r\ngoing, and spoke as if we were out only on a day's shooting excursion.\r\nI had generally kept the gun in my own possession, as I was a better\r\nshot than he was, and had more chance of killing any game we might come\r\nacross.  Frequently he had declared that he saw buffalo and deer in the\r\ndistance, and wanted the gun to go in chase of them; but as I was very\r\nsure that none were in sight, I had kept it till the idea wore off.\r\nTwice I rose to make up the fire, the flames of which I kept watching\r\ntill they sank low.  It was very important to keep it blazing, lest any\r\nwolves, or a still more terrible grizzly bear, should find us out.\r\n\r\nFinding myself at last dropping to sleep, I called Pat, and told him to\r\nkeep an eye on the fire.\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" he answered; \"don't be throubling yourself, Masther David.\"\r\nAnd I saw him sitting up and rubbing his eyes.  Trusting that he would\r\ndo as he promised, I lay back and quickly dropped off to sleep.\r\n\r\nIt was bright daylight when I awoke.  On looking round I found that Pat\r\nwas not where I had last seen him.  Supposing that he had awoke early,\r\nand, unwilling to arouse me, had gone to collect some sticks to make up\r\nthe fire, I did not feel anxious.  When, however, I got up and looked\r\nround on every side, I could nowhere see him.  Still fancying that he\r\ncould not have gone to any great distance, and would soon return, I\r\noccupied myself in scraping the embers of the fire together.\r\n\r\nAt last, after waiting for some time, I became still more anxious.  He\r\nhad, I found, taken the gun with him, but, strange to say, had left the\r\nammunition behind.  This circumstance made me fear that he had lost his\r\nsenses, and had gone off, not knowing what he was about.\r\n\r\nHe might, however, have gone out, I thought, in search of game.\r\n\r\n\"Well, if he has gone, I trust that he will bring back something for\r\nbreakfast,\" I said to myself, \"if he manages to hit with his first\r\nshot.\"\r\n\r\nTaking my spear in my hand, I at last set out, intending to track him.\r\nThe snow, as I have before said, had nearly all disappeared; but still\r\nhere and there I could trace his footsteps without much difficulty.  I\r\nwent on for some distance till I arrived at a wood.  I entered it, and\r\nwas soon utterly unable to discover in what direction he had gone.\r\nAgain I felt my inferiority to an Indian under similar circumstances.\r\n\r\nI had left our pot and tin cup at the camp, and I feared that should I\r\npush on in the attempt to discover him, I might lose myself altogether,\r\nand not be able to make my way back.  I accordingly returned to the\r\ncamp, having still some hopes that Pat, making a circuit, might rejoin\r\nme.\r\n\r\nI waited, but waited in vain.  At last I became ravenously hungry.  I\r\nhad the skin in which our meat had been packed, and singeing off the\r\nhair, I cut a portion of it into thin strips.  After the skin had boiled\r\nfor some time, I attempted to eat it, by cutting it up into very small\r\npieces.  I managed to chew them, and to drink the water in which they\r\nhad been boiled.  The food, such as it was, somewhat allayed the\r\ngnawings of hunger.  I still kept a portion for Pat, should he appear\r\nwithout any game; but the day wore on, and he did not come.\r\n\r\nThough I frequently before during our disastrous expedition had been\r\nvery miserable, I now felt more wretched than ever, beginning seriously\r\nto fear that I should perish with hunger.  While I thought of myself, I\r\nat the same time thought of poor Pat, greatly dreading that some\r\naccident must have befallen him--either that he had met a grizzly bear,\r\nand had been squeezed to death, or been carried off and killed by\r\nIndians.\r\n\r\nIf such had been his fate, the same might be mine.  Still, I determined\r\nto struggle on, so long as I had life to do so.  The day was already so\r\nfar advanced that I thought it wiser to remain where I was, and not to\r\nstart off till next morning, when I intended to push northward, in hopes\r\nof at last getting to the fort.\r\n\r\nI passed the night in attending to my fire, and taking short snatches of\r\nsleep.  In the morning I boiled some more skin, and having eaten it,\r\nslung the pot over my back and commenced my solitary march.  I walked on\r\ntill nearly noon, when, utterly exhausted from want of sleep and food, I\r\nsank down under shelter of a copse which I had just reached.  How long I\r\nhad remained in a state of unconsciousness I could not tell, when I felt\r\nsomething licking my hand.  I opened my eyes with the idea that a wolf\r\nor a grizzly bear was about to seize me.\r\n\r\nWhat was my astonishment to behold our dog Bouncer, a general favourite\r\nat the fort, but especially attached to me.\r\n\r\n\"Bouncer, old fellow, where have you come from?\"  I exclaimed.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he heard me speak, he began leaping round me, and barking for\r\njoy at finding me alive.\r\n\r\n\"Where are the rest, Bouncer?  Are they near at hand?\"  I asked; but the\r\nonly reply Bouncer could make was to wag his tail and bark and attempt\r\nto lick me all over.\r\n\r\nThe sight of the faithful dog greatly restored my spirits and even my\r\nstrength, for I was able to get up and walk more steadily than I had\r\nbeen doing during the whole morning.  I looked about in every direction,\r\nexpecting to see some of my friends who had come in search of me; but no\r\none appeared, nor did Bouncer show any intention of leaving my side.\r\nThat he would know the way to the fort I felt very sure, and I now hoped\r\nthat I should have no difficulty in reaching it.  He looked in pretty\r\ngood condition, so I judged that he could not have been very long on the\r\nsearch.  I walked on as I had been going when I sank down, and as he did\r\nnot attempt to lead me in any other direction, I concluded that I was\r\ntaking the right course.  Before long we came to a wood.  As I suspected\r\nthat I should be led a considerable distance out of the direct line of\r\nmarch should I attempt to go round the wood, I made my way through it,\r\nand found that it bordered a broad stream, too deep apparently in that\r\nplace to ford.  I therefore continued down the stream.  Before I had\r\ngone far, what was my surprise to see lying on the bank a small canoe,\r\nknown among us as a bull boat or parchment canoe.  It was formed of\r\nbuffalo hide with the hair scraped off, stretched over a framework.  It\r\ncontained a single paddle, but there was nothing else whatever in it.\r\nThe canoe appeared to be in very good condition, and to require nothing\r\nwhatever done to it to make it fit for a voyage down the stream.\r\n\r\nFrom its construction, I came to the conclusion that it was not a canoe\r\nbelonging to our fort, though at first I supposed that it must have been\r\nleft by some of the party who had come out in search of me.  Of one\r\nthing I felt sure, that the stream would conduct me into the river\r\nSaskatchewan, and that I should now be able, without further fatigue, to\r\narrive at the fort.\r\n\r\nHunger made me anxious to get off as soon as possible.  As I launched\r\nthe canoe, Bouncer stood watching my proceedings with evident\r\nsatisfaction, and convinced me that he knew I was right.\r\n\r\nBeing well acquainted with the management of a canoe, I had no fears\r\nabout making the voyage in safety.  I stepped in, and Bouncer followed,\r\nsitting in front of me; then taking the paddle, I shoved off, and\r\ncommenced my voyage down the stream.\r\n\r\nThe current ran gently, and I paddled on, expecting to have an easy\r\nvoyage.  As I was not acquainted with the appearance of the banks, I did\r\nnot know how far off the fort was; but I knew that I must have some\r\ndistance to go.  I could not possibly tell when I might reach my\r\ndestination.\r\n\r\nHad poor Pat been with me, I should have been very happy, but his\r\ndisappearance caused me much anxiety.  I knew, of course, however, that\r\nas soon as I got to the fort a party would be sent out to look for him.\r\nI paddled eagerly on, expecting every moment to come to some part of the\r\nriver with which I was acquainted.\r\n\r\nThe stream became more rapid, and the banks were higher than at the spot\r\nat which I embarked.  Occasionally there were low cliffs, and here and\r\nthere rocks projected some way from the shore, compelling me to keep in\r\nthe centre of the stream.  Now and then wild-fowl rose up, and in their\r\nflight passed but a short distance from the sight of my longing eyes.\r\nHad I possessed a rifle, I would have stopped and shot one of them to\r\nsatisfy my hunger.  Now I proceeded a mile or two with scarcely any\r\nperceptible current; now I reached a part of the river with trees of\r\nconsiderable height growing on both banks, the wind, which was pretty\r\nstrong, blowing amid their branches, and causing a loud murmuring sound.\r\nIt contributed somewhat to drown another sound which now reached my\r\nears.  The sound I heard was that of rushing water, and I guessed that\r\nsome rapids were near, but their exact distance off I could not tell.\r\n\r\nEager to get to the end of my voyage, I paddled on.  I fancied that I\r\nshould without difficulty, should I find myself near the rapids, paddle\r\nto one bank or the other and land, so that I might examine them before\r\nattempting their descent.  If I found them too dangerous, I could carry\r\nmy canoe overland and launch it again below them.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, however, a loud roar burst on my ears, and I found the canoe\r\ndrawn rapidly forward.  Bouncer looked up and barked, gazing towards the\r\nshore.  I attempted to turn the canoe and paddle in that direction, but\r\nthe current was too strong to enable me to succeed.  I at once saw that\r\nmy only chance of safety was boldly to descend the rapids.\r\n\r\nI grasped my paddle tightly.  In another moment the bow of my canoe was\r\non the very edge of the cataract, and the next instant gliding downwards\r\nlike an arrow, the water boiling and hissing on either side.\r\n\r\nI looked anxiously ahead, to ascertain if there were any rocks in the\r\nway.  Should my frail canoe strike on one, she must in a moment be\r\nknocked to pieces; and in so rapid a current I might find it very\r\ndifficult to reach the shore, though I knew that Bouncer would give me\r\nall the assistance in his power.\r\n\r\nI held my paddle in the water, my only aim being to keep the canoe with\r\nher head straight down the rapid.  She floated buoyantly, though it\r\nseemed a wonder that she should not be overwhelmed by the tumultuous\r\nwaters raging around her.\r\n\r\nMuch depended on my retaining my presence of mind, and avoiding any\r\nrocks which might appear.  On and on I went; now a dark rock rose on one\r\nside, now on the other, the spray as the water struck them from above\r\nbeing scattered far round, and often completely deluging me.\r\n\r\nNow the canoe seemed to be hurrying on to a rock, when by exerting all\r\nmy strength I directed her course so as to avoid it, and the next moment\r\nwas shooting by, almost touching as I passed.  Thus the canoe rushed\r\nforward in its rapid descent.  I had no time to think or to consider\r\nwhat I should do, if it were to strike.  I could not tell how long a\r\ntime was spent in shooting the rapid; I only know that at length I found\r\nmyself at its foot, floating on the comparatively tranquil water.\r\n\r\nStriking now on one side, now on the other, I made the canoe dart\r\nforward and continued my course, thankful that I had escaped the danger,\r\nand earnestly hoping that I should not have to encounter another of a\r\nsimilar character; still I knew that very possibly there might be more\r\nrapids before the stream emptied itself into the broad Saskatchewan.\r\n\r\nShould I find myself much above the fort, I might have others to shoot\r\nin that river; but I was well acquainted with them, and had no fear\r\nabout being able to guide my canoe in safety amid the rocks which rose\r\nup here and there across the stream.\r\n\r\nI was becoming almost faint with hunger when, to my great satisfaction,\r\nI recognised several spots along the banks I was passing, and I knew\r\nthat I was not more than a couple of miles above the mouth of the\r\nstream.  As the current was pretty strong, the distance was soon\r\naccomplished, and I found myself in the Saskatchewan, which even thus\r\nfar, in the very heart of America, and only ten days' journey or so from\r\nthe base of the Rocky Mountains, is a river of considerable width.  Had\r\nI not known that there was a hearty welcome and abundance of food at the\r\nend of my journey, I could not have borne the hunger I was enduring, but\r\nhope cheered me on.\r\n\r\nAt length my eyes were gladdened by the sight of the flag waving above\r\nthe fort, and I could see the palisades which extended to the edge of\r\nthe bank above the river.\r\n\r\nI renewed my efforts, and Bouncer set up a bark of delight to announce\r\nmy coming, feeling, I have no doubt, very proud in the belief that he\r\nhad brought me back.  So he had; and he would, I am sure, had I not\r\nfound the canoe, have led me overland, but his instinct had told him\r\nthat the most speedy way of reaching the fort would be by water.\r\n\r\nNot till I was close to the bank was I discovered, when my brother\r\nAlick, followed closely by several other persons, hurried out of the\r\ngate to welcome me.\r\n\r\n\"Why, David, you appear as one from the dead,\" he exclaimed, wringing my\r\nhand.  \"We had almost given you up as lost.  We have sent out party\r\nafter party to look for you, and Bouncer alone has the honour of\r\nbringing you back.  Martin and Rose and Letty have been as unhappy as I\r\nhave felt.  They are all eager to know what has happened to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot tell you until I have had something to eat,\" I answered.\r\n\r\nJust then looking up I saw the friends he mentioned, who I had no idea\r\nwere at the fort.  They all warmly shook hands, but forbore to put any\r\nfurther questions, for they saw how weak I was; indeed, had not Alick\r\nand Martin assisted me, short as was the distance, I could not have\r\nreached the fort.\r\n\r\nWe were soon inside, and Rose and Letty hurried to the kitchen, to get\r\nsome buffalo steaks and white-fish, which were fortunately cooking for\r\nsupper.\r\n\r\nA good meal greatly restored me.  My first inquiries were for Sandy and\r\nPierre, whom I had not seen.  I was greatly relieved to hear that they\r\nhad found their way to the fort two days after the snowstorm, with all\r\nthe baggage animals and my horse, and had since gone out on the\r\nexpeditions to search for Pat and me.\r\n\r\nSandy would not believe that I was lost, but had again set out only two\r\ndays before.  From the direction he had taken, I was in great hopes that\r\nhe would fall in with poor Pat and bring him back safe.  How Bouncer had\r\ncome to find me, or to whom the canoe belonged, no one could tell.  When\r\nthe previous expeditions had set out, Bouncer had been chained up, as he\r\nhad a peculiar antipathy for Indians; and it was feared that, should any\r\nbe met, he would fly at them, and do mischief, or get killed himself.\r\nHe had observed the several parties setting out, and had sagaciously\r\nsurmised that they were going in search of me, without being able to\r\nunderstand why he should not have been allowed to accompany them.\r\n\r\nSoon after Sandy had last started from the fort he had managed to make\r\nhis escape, and had either followed Sandy's trail or had taken an\r\nindependent course by himself.  Which he had done it would be impossible\r\nto ascertain, nor did it matter.  I, at all events, felt deeply indebted\r\nto him, and we became more attached friends than ever.  On the canoe\r\nbeing examined, Alick and the other people in the fort were decidedly of\r\nthe opinion that it was built by Indians, and must have come down from\r\nthe upper part of the stream, which rose a considerable way to the\r\nsouthward; they also believed from its appearance that it had not long\r\nbeen hauled up on the bank.  It had very evidently belonged to a Plain\r\nCree, as those people are hunters of buffalo, and when living in the\r\nneighbourhood of streams or lakes, construct these parchment canoes for\r\nthe purpose of fishing.  This they are compelled to do, as there are but\r\nfew birch trees of any size in the part of the country they inhabit.\r\nExcept in shape, it was very similar to the coracles still in use, as I\r\nhave read, on the Wye and other rivers in England.\r\n\r\nThe canoe was carried into the fort; Alick intending, should the owner\r\nappear at any time, to return it, and to pay him for its use.\r\n\r\nI now inquired how Martin and his sister Letty came to be at the fort.\r\nThey had, I found, arrived a few days after we left it for Fort Ross.\r\n\r\n\"My father and mother,\" said Martin, when Rose and Letty were out of the\r\nroom, \"wished us to come, as I am sorry to say that the Indians in our\r\nneighbourhood have lately been showing a bad disposition; and though the\r\nconverts who live round us are faithful, and would defend us with their\r\nlives, they are but few in number compared with the heathen Indians.\r\nThe latter have, during the summer, suffered greatly from smallpox, and\r\ntheir cunning medicine-men have persuaded them it is owing to the\r\ncircumstance that some of their people have deserted their ancient\r\ncustoms, and that the complaint has been introduced by the pale-faces.\r\nThey are not very clear about the matter, but regard my father with an\r\nevil eye, instead of treating him as before with respect, even when they\r\ndeclined listening to him.  He is not alarmed about himself, but he\r\nthought it prudent to send Rose and Letty to a safer place, and directed\r\nme to take charge of them.  Though very unwilling to leave him and my\r\nmother, I was, of course, obliged to obey his commands.  We came down\r\nthe river in a small canoe.  It was so severely battered on the voyage\r\nthat, though we escaped actual shipwreck, your brother Alick considered\r\nit would be highly imprudent to continue the voyage in it to Fort Ross.\r\nWe therefore dispatched a messenger to Mr Meredith, requesting him to\r\nsend us up an escort; but we greatly fear, as we have received no\r\nanswer, that the man must have perished in the snowstorm which overtook\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nAlick had the same fears about the messenger Jacques Allon, the only man\r\nwho could be spared from the fort.\r\n\r\nJacques wished himself to go, declaring that he could make his way\r\nwithout difficulty, even though a whole tribe of hostile Indians were on\r\nthe watch for him.  Whether he had been cut off by Indians or had\r\nperished in the snow remained doubtful.\r\n\r\nThough very sorry to lose poor Jacques, we were thankful that our\r\nfriends were safe with us, and we promised to take very good care of\r\nthem till Mr Meredith should hear of their being at Fort Black, and\r\nshould come, as he probably would, to fetch them away.  Alick and I\r\nwould, at all events, in the meantime enjoy their society.\r\n\r\nMartin was a great friend of ours, and the young ladies added a\r\nbrightness to the routine of our ordinary life at the fort; not that we\r\nwere ever idle or found the time hang heavily on our hands.  Each season\r\nhad its various occupations.  We were either out hunting buffalo, or\r\ndeer, or smaller animals, or were fishing in some of the neighbouring\r\nlakes for white-fish, or were preparing them or pemmican for our winter\r\nstores or for travelling; or packing the skins we had obtained, or\r\ntrading with the Indians.\r\n\r\nThe buffaloes which we killed when ice could be obtained, either at the\r\nend of the winter or after the frost had set in, were preserved in a\r\nvery easy though somewhat rough manner.  We had a deep circular pit,\r\nlike a well, dug in the fort.  The sides were lined with ice, and a\r\nlayer of ice was placed at the bottom.  The carcass was then cut up, and\r\na layer of meat pressed tightly down on the ice; another layer of ice\r\nwas then thrown in and another layer of buffalo meat; and thus layer\r\nafter layer of ice and meat was placed in the pit till it was full.  It\r\nwas then covered over with ice and boards and earth, so that we had\r\nalways an ample supply of fresh buffalo meat at our command, even during\r\nthe hottest time of the year.\r\n\r\nFish we preserved in the same manner.  Of course, during the winter\r\nthere was no necessity for putting them into the pit.  We had only to\r\nlet them freeze, and they remained hard frozen till the return of\r\nspring.\r\n\r\nWe had lately obtained a good supply of both meat and fish, so that we\r\nwere well able to entertain our guests.\r\n\r\nOn speaking to Alick privately, I found that he was not very well\r\nsatisfied with the temper of some of the Indians in the neighbourhood\r\nwho had hitherto professed to be our friends; while reports had reached\r\nhim that the Blackfeet and other tribes of Sioux were threatening to\r\ndrive the pale-faces out of the country.  He, of course, laughed at the\r\nidea of their making the attempt.\r\n\r\n\"Though they might attack small parties of travellers,\" he said, \"or\r\nsuch forts as ours in advanced positions.  However, if they do come, we\r\nshall be able to defend ourselves, and teach them that they would have\r\nbeen wiser to keep to their hunting-grounds.  On the chance of their\r\ncoming I have made every preparation for defence, and they will not\r\ncapture Fort Black with as much ease as they may suppose.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FOUR.\r\n\r\nHURRAH!  PAT IS FOUND--SANDY MCTAVISH'S YARN--HIS DISCOVERY OF ROBIN\r\nGREY--TOBOGGANING--THE DOG-TRAIN--OUR SORROW AT THE DEPARTURE OF ROSE\r\nAND LETTY--WE START ON SNOW-SHOES--WOLVES OUT FORAGING--A RACE FOR\r\nLIFE--THE FORT IN SIGHT--SAFE AT LAST--ROBIN'S STORY--HIS CAPTURE BY THE\r\nINDIANS--WAMEGON--HIS POOR FEET--HIS IMPRISONMENT IN THE\r\nLOG--\"NETNOKWA,\" HIS INDIAN MOTHER--THE INDIAN DANCE--WAMEGON PERSECUTES\r\nHIM--ROBIN'S NOVEL METHOD OF KILLING A DEER--WAMEGON PERSEVERES IN HIS\r\nCRUELTY.\r\n\r\nI had been two whole days at the fort, and no news had been received of\r\nSandy and his party, who had gone in search of poor Pat and me.\r\n\r\nI was rapidly recovering my strength, and Rose and Letty by their kind\r\nattentions greatly contributed to raise my spirits.  They had not been\r\ntold of the danger Mr Crisp apprehended, and Rose only supposed that\r\nshe was going to Fort Ross for the sake of being a companion to Letty.\r\nThey were therefore perfectly happy, and laughed and joked as their\r\nnatural tempers inclined them to do.\r\n\r\nWe were, of course, rather anxious about Sandy and poor Pat.  The latter\r\nI scarcely expected to see again, for ill as he was when he went away\r\nfrom me, I feared that if not at once found he would have been starved\r\nto death.\r\n\r\nI have not yet described our fort.  It consisted of strong palisades,\r\nsurrounding nearly half an acre of ground, with wooden towers at the\r\nfour corners, projecting so as to enfilade each of the sides.  The whole\r\nwas surrounded by a trench, which would make it difficult for an enemy\r\nto approach the walls, if they were well defended with musketry.  The\r\ninterior was occupied by dwelling-houses and stores, and huts and\r\nwigwams for the accommodation of the hunters and canoe-men who might be\r\ndetained during the winter.\r\n\r\nThough small, our fort was thus of considerable strength, and we had no\r\nfear, should it be attacked, of being able to defeat any number of\r\nIndians who might come against it.\r\n\r\nEvening was approaching when the lookout, who was always stationed at\r\nthe top of the highest tower which faced the open country, gave notice\r\nthat he saw several persons on horseback approaching.\r\n\r\nWe hurried up the tower with our spy-glasses, and before long, greatly\r\nto our satisfaction, we distinguished Sandy at the head of the party.\r\n\r\n\"Hurrah!\"  I exclaimed, \"and there's Pat.  I'm sure it must be him, and\r\nPierre is riding alongside him, and supporting him on his horse.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see a boy too,\" exclaimed Martin.  \"He looks to me very like an\r\nIndian, and yet I fancy he's got a white face.  Who can he be?\"\r\n\r\nAs the party drew nearer, we were satisfied that we were right in our\r\nconjectures.  We all hurried out to meet them.\r\n\r\nSandy, as soon as he saw me, jumped off his horse, and nearly shook my\r\nhand off in his delight at finding I was safe.\r\n\r\n\"I thought it was all right,\" he exclaimed, \"as I'll tell you by-and-by.\r\nWe found your last resting-place, and traced you to the canoe; and as I\r\ndiscovered that Bouncer had made his way to you, I felt sure that you\r\nhad gone down the stream, though I was not so sure how you would have\r\nshot the rapids.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you know that I came down in a canoe?\"  I asked.\r\n\r\n\"I have not been so long in the country, and accustomed to Indian ways,\r\nnot to have seen that you had launched a canoe from the bank; besides\r\nwhich I had another proof, if any had been wanting, but I'll tell you\r\nall about it presently,\" he answered.\r\n\r\n\"And how did you find Pat?\" asked Alick.\r\n\r\n\"And who is that boy in the Indian dress?\" inquired Martin.\r\n\r\n\"If you put one question at a time, young gentlemen, I'll tell you how\r\nit all happened,\" said Sandy.  \"But if you have no objection, we'll go\r\ninto the fort and have some supper first; for as we have pushed on to\r\nget here before nightfall, we have had no opportunity of satisfying our\r\nhunger since noon.\"\r\n\r\nThe horses of the party being taken by the other men, we entered the\r\nfort together, Martin regarding the young stranger with a look of\r\ncuriosity.  He appeared to be somewhat abashed at finding himself among\r\nso many white people, though it was very evident from his features and\r\ncomplexion that he was himself a white.  Martin, who was always\r\nkind-hearted, seeing the unwillingness of the boy to advance, went\r\ntowards him, and taking his hand said, \"Come along; we want to hear all\r\nabout you.\"\r\n\r\nThe boy opened his large blue eyes, but made no answer, though he\r\nunderstood Martin's signs, and accompanied him willingly.  Martin then\r\nled him up to Rose and Letty.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps he can understand you, but he makes no reply to anything I say\r\nto him,\" said Martin.\r\n\r\nRose spoke to him first, and then Letty exclaimed, \"Surely you can speak\r\nEnglish?\"\r\n\r\nThe boy shook his head, though he tried to say something, but was unable\r\nto pronounce the words.\r\n\r\n\"You understand what we say, though,\" remarked Letty; \"I am sure you do\r\nby your looks!\"\r\n\r\nThe boy nodded, and a smile for a moment irradiated his features, though\r\nthey quickly again assumed their former startled look.\r\n\r\n\"He has spoken English, and I am very sure will be able to speak it\r\nagain,\" said Martin.  \"He has evidently been living a long time among\r\nIndians, and it's my belief he has made his escape from them.--Is that\r\nthe case, boy?\"\r\n\r\nThe young stranger considered for a moment, endeavouring to understand\r\nwhat Martin had said, and then he again nodded.\r\n\r\n\"I knew it was so,\" exclaimed Martin.  \"We shall soon find out all about\r\nhim, and in a few days he will be able to speak English as well as any\r\nof us.--Come along, boy; you are hungry, I'm sure, after your long ride,\r\nand we are all going in to supper.\"\r\n\r\nMartin taking possession of the young stranger, I did not interfere, but\r\nfollowed Pat, who had been led into the house.  Though the poor fellow\r\nhad apparently lost his senses, he certainly had not lost his appetite,\r\nand as soon as the food was placed before him he began to devour it\r\neagerly.\r\n\r\n\"Let him take his meat,\" observed Sandy.  \"It'll do the chiel gude.  He\r\nhasna had muckle to put intil his inside, though we spared him all we\r\ncould from our store.\"\r\n\r\nWe asked Sandy no further questions till supper was over, when he gave\r\nus an account of his adventures.\r\n\r\nPushing directly southward, he had come across the trail Pat and I had\r\nmade in our wanderings several days before; when, following this up, he\r\nhad reached our last camp a short time after I had quitted it.  At\r\nfirst, misled by the trail I had formed when going in search of Pat, he\r\nhad continued to follow that; but convinced at last that I had returned,\r\nhe was on the point of coming back, when one of the men saw an object,\r\nwhich he was sure was a human being, lying on the ground under a tree.\r\nThey soon discovered it to be Pat, who had fallen to the ground\r\nexhausted, and would very soon have died.  By pouring some\r\nspirits-and-water down his throat he revived, and still further\r\nrecovered when he had taken some food.  Though able to speak, he could\r\ngive no account of himself or me.\r\n\r\nSandy, who had come across the trail I had formed when returning to the\r\ncamp, now pursued it, and discovered that I had passed through the wood,\r\ntowards the river.  He had gone about half way, when he caught sight of\r\na person endeavouring to conceal himself among the bushes.  He at first\r\nsupposed that an Indian was lying in ambush for some sinister object,\r\nand keeping his gun ready to fire he made his way towards the spot.  His\r\nsurprise was great when he discovered the young white stranger whom he\r\nhad brought with him.\r\n\r\nThe lad was much alarmed at first, but his confidence returned when he\r\nfound that he had fallen into the hands of people of his own colour.  He\r\ncould speak but a few words of the dialect of the Plain Crees, though\r\nsufficient briefly to explain that he was making his escape from a tribe\r\nwho had kept him in slavery, and that his intention was to descend the\r\nriver, which he fancied fell into the ocean; and he said that he there\r\nhoped to meet with friends who would be glad to have him back.\r\n\r\nSandy, on hearing this, accompanied him to the bank of the river, where,\r\nnot finding his canoe, he expressed the most bitter disappointment.\r\n\r\nSandy at length comforted him with the assurance that he would take him\r\nby a safer route to some white people, who would endeavour to discover\r\nthe friends of whom he was in search.\r\n\r\n\"More than this I was unable to learn,\" observed Sandy; \"but it's vera\r\nclear that the boy was kidnapped by the redskins sometime or other,\r\nthough not long enough ago to make him forget his relatives and friends.\r\nAt the same time, not having spoken a word of English for three or four\r\nyears, or perhaps more, he finds it almost impossible to express what he\r\nwishes to say.\"\r\n\r\nWe all agreed that it would be better to let the young stranger become\r\naccustomed to us before we questioned him about his history.  If then he\r\nhad ever, as Sandy suspected, spoken English, he would probably\r\nrecollect it.  At present we had great difficulty in communicating with\r\nhim, as he was chiefly accustomed to speak the language of the Sioux,\r\nwith which we were unacquainted.\r\n\r\nRose and Letty volunteered to take him in hand.  \"We shall soon find out\r\nall about him, if he has got a tongue in his head,\" said Rose, laughing;\r\n\"he will trust us more readily than he will you boys, and I am very sure\r\nthat we shall soon become friends.\"\r\n\r\nNo event of importance occurred for some time at the fort.  Our hunters\r\nwent out, and were successful in killing several buffalo, which gave us\r\nan ample supply of meat for the winter.\r\n\r\nThe frost had now set in, not to break up for several months, and snow\r\ncovered the face of nature.  When not engaged in our duties, we boys and\r\ngirls amused ourselves by tobogganing, the sloping bank of the river\r\naffording us a capital place for sliding down.  We each of us had\r\nmanufactured a toboggan, which is a small sleigh composed of a long thin\r\nslip of willow wood turned up in front.  Several of ours were large\r\nenough to carry two, and we each of us were eager to obtain the company\r\nof one of the young ladies, I especially that of Letty.\r\n\r\nI sat at the extreme after-end of the toboggan to steer it with my feet,\r\nwhile Letty sat just in front of me.  The snow, which lay thickly on the\r\nsloping bank, was soon hardened.  Placing the toboggan on the top, we\r\ntook our seats, when a very slight shove was sufficient to send it off,\r\nand down we slid at a rapid rate, increasing our speed every instant,\r\ntill we had gained sufficient impetus to glide right across the frozen\r\nsurface of the river to the opposite bank, which also sloped at a\r\nconvenient angle.\r\n\r\nSteps were cut upon one side of the slides, by which we ascended to the\r\nsummit.  Thus we were able to pass backwards and forwards, the rapidity\r\nof the motion and the risk of upsetting giving excitement to the\r\namusement.\r\n\r\nAlick generally took charge of Rose, who was not at all unwilling to\r\nhave him as her charioteer.  The other boys had smaller toboggans, each\r\nhaving one to himself.\r\n\r\nUp and down the icy hills we went, and across the bright glassy river,\r\nlaughing and shouting for hours together; indeed, I confess that we were\r\nnever tired of the sport.\r\n\r\nSometimes I must own that we were upset, and rolled down to the bottom;\r\nthough we were never much the worse for the catastrophe, for of course\r\nwe were all well wrapped up in warm clothing.\r\n\r\nThe young stranger entered into this amusement with as much zest as any\r\nof us.  He quickly recovered his spirits, and, under the tuition of\r\nLetty and Rose, soon found English words in which to express himself.\r\nHis English name, he told us, was Robin, though he had been called\r\nKishkanko by the Indians.\r\n\r\n\"It is a very ugly name, and we don't intend to call you by it,\" said\r\nLetty.\r\n\r\n\"Pray don't; I would rather be called Robin, as I used to be when I was\r\na little boy by my father, and mother, and sister.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you had a father, and mother, and sister,\" said Rose.\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes! and I love them so much, and they love me; and I wanted to go\r\nback to them, and thought I should have died when the cruel Indians\r\nwould not let me,\" answered Robin.\r\n\r\n\"We want very much to hear how it was that the Indians took you away\r\nfrom your family,\" said Rose; \"you must tell Letty and me all about it.\"\r\n\r\nRobin passed his hand across his brow, as if trying to collect his\r\nthoughts.  It was very evident that the circumstances were of a painful\r\ndescription.  He was about to begin, when it was announced that several\r\ndog-sleighs were approaching the fort from the eastward.  There was no\r\ndoubt that they were coming from Fort Ross.\r\n\r\nWe all hurried out to meet them, and in a short time we saw that Mr\r\nMeredith himself was leading the party, which consisted of two clerks\r\nand several hunters.  He was on his road, he said, to Mr Crisp's\r\nmissionary station, to bring away his daughter Letty, and Rose, if her\r\nparents would allow her to accompany him; and he was very happy to find\r\nthat they were already with us.  He had heard rumours of the disaffected\r\nstate of the Indians in the neighbourhood of the station, and was\r\nunwilling to allow his daughter to remain longer there.  He intended,\r\nindeed, to try to persuade Mr and Mrs Crisp to quit the place, at all\r\nevents till the return of spring, when, even if they went there again,\r\nthey might at any time make their escape down the river, should they be\r\nthreatened with danger.\r\n\r\nMartin, however, assured Mr Meredith that his parents would not on any\r\naccount be induced to quit their station; and that, though they were not\r\nblind to the danger, they were resolved to await whatever events might\r\noccur.\r\n\r\nOn hearing this, Mr Meredith, who was anxious as soon as possible to\r\nreturn to Fort Ross, determined not to go farther, but said that he\r\nwould spend two days with us to recruit his men and dogs, and then go\r\nback to his own fort.\r\n\r\nWe were very sorry to part with Rose and Letty, though it was, of\r\ncourse, but right that they should be under the care of Mr Meredith.  I\r\nwas afraid that I should also lose Martin; but he had been so happy with\r\nus that he begged hard to be allowed to remain on, and Mr Meredith\r\nconsented to let him spend the rest of the winter with us.  Alick could\r\ngive him some work to do, while at Fort Ross there were already as many\r\nclerks as could find employment.\r\n\r\nWe were afraid also, that Robin would be taken away; but Alick, having\r\ndiscovered that his great wish was to be sent to the eastward, where he\r\naffirmed that he had friends living, it was determined to allow him to\r\nremain at Fort Black, as any travellers who might be coming from across\r\nthe Rocky Mountains were more likely to visit us than they were Fort\r\nRoss, which was out of the road.  It was settled that, should no one\r\nappear, Robin should be sent by water when the navigation was again\r\nopened in spring.\r\n\r\nRobin himself would gladly have accompanied Rose and Letty; but when he\r\nunderstood the object of our keeping him, he seemed perfectly reconciled\r\nto the arrangement.\r\n\r\nAll matters having been settled, our friends prepared to set out.  There\r\nwere three sleighs drawn by dogs.  Mr Meredith took charge of his\r\ndaughter Letty, and Rose was driven by Mr Macmillan, the eldest of the\r\ntwo clerks, of whom I suspect Alick felt rather jealous.\r\n\r\nThe third sleigh carried a small bell-tent, intended for the use of the\r\nyoung ladies, as they would have to encamp several nights on the\r\njourney.  The rest of the men were to travel on snow-shoes by the side\r\nof the sleighs, with which they could very easily keep up.  They were\r\nall well armed, for though Indians were not likely to be moving about at\r\nthat season of the year, it was still possible that, should they have\r\nheard of Mr Meredith's journey, they might make an attempt to cut him\r\noff; at all events, it was wise to be on the safe side.\r\n\r\nWe were very sorry indeed to part with them, but we kept up our spirits;\r\nand as they issued early one morning from the gate of the fort, we all\r\nsallied forth, cheering them on their way.  We little thought at the\r\ntime what events were to occur before we should again meet.\r\n\r\nMartin and I accompanied them for some distance on our snow-shoes.\r\n\r\n\"Now, lads, you have gone far enough,\" said Mr Meredith.  \"It is not\r\nwise to make too long a journey at the commencement of winter, before\r\nyour ankles are well accustomed to the straps of your snow-shoes.  You\r\nwill be getting the racquettes, and may knock up before you reach the\r\nfort.\"\r\n\r\nWe were compelled to obey him, and wish him and our fair young friends\r\ngood-bye.  We stood watching them till the sleighs appeared like so many\r\nblack ants in the far distance, while we could not even distinguish the\r\nmen who ran by their sides.\r\n\r\n\"Come,\" said Martin, \"we must put our best feet foremost, and get back\r\nas soon as we can.  There's no chance of losing the trail so long as we\r\nhave daylight.\"\r\n\r\nIt is extraordinary at what speed a person wearing snow-shoes can run\r\nover the hard snow.  A snow-shoe consists of an elongated oblong\r\nframework of wood, with cross-pieces; the interior filled up with a\r\nstrong network, on which the foot rests, with a hole for the play of the\r\nheel.  This is secured to the feet and ankles by leathern thongs.  It\r\nnecessitates keeping the feet somewhat wide apart, to prevent the shoes\r\nbeing entangled with each other.\r\n\r\nA person not accustomed to their use is very apt to topple down and find\r\nsome difficulty in getting up again.  Martin and I, however, had had\r\nplenty of practice during the two previous winters, though we had not\r\ngone very far on our return before we felt our ankles pain us\r\nconsiderably.  We stopped to rest, but could not venture to remain long,\r\nas the cold was already intense; and expecting to be constantly in\r\nexercise, we had not put on our warmest clothing.  A short rest,\r\nhowever, greatly restored us, and we had made good half the distance\r\nback to the fort when Martin, who happened to look round to the\r\nsouthward, exclaimed that he saw some dark objects in the snow.\r\n\r\n\"Whether they are wolves or Indians crouching down to try and get on us\r\nunawares is more than I can tell,\" he observed; \"but whichever they are,\r\nwe had better push forward, and endeavour to keep ahead of them.\"\r\n\r\nI of course agreed with him, and as we went along we looked to the\r\nprimings of our rifles, so that we might be prepared to defend\r\nourselves.\r\n\r\n\"For my part, I would rather they should follow us than attack our\r\nfriends,\" I observed.  \"Perhaps they are some of the tribe Mr Meredith\r\nheard of, and did not come up in time to see him pass; if so, we shall\r\nrender him good service by leading them up to the fort.\"\r\n\r\n\"You take it for granted that they are Indians,\" said Martin; \"I am not\r\nquite so certain of the fact.  I rather believe that they are a small\r\npack of wolves; and if they were not so far off, we should hear them\r\nhowling to their friends in the neighbourhood to join in the chase.\r\nHowever, we need not be afraid of them; for if they get within shot we\r\ncan kill a couple, and the rest are sure to stop and devour their\r\ncompanions, and allow us to increase our distance.\"  He made these\r\nremarks as we were running on over the snow at a rate which would cost\r\neven Indians or wolves a considerable amount of exertion to overtake us.\r\n\r\nBefore, however, we had made good another mile, the objects we had seen\r\nwere sufficiently near to assure us that they were wolves out on a\r\nforaging expedition.  That they would, on seeing us run, pursue us there\r\ncould be no doubt, and we occasionally looked back to determine when was\r\nthe best time to stop, in order to take a steady aim at the leaders.\r\n\r\n\"Now we must give it them,\" at length cried Martin, who had just looked\r\nround.\r\n\r\nWe suddenly halted, and swinging our right feet round, confronted the\r\npack; then, both of us taking deliberate aim, we fired.\r\n\r\nThe two leading wolves fell, and, as we expected, the rest of the hungry\r\npack immediately set on them, and tore their carcasses to pieces.\r\nHaving reloaded, we again continued our course.\r\n\r\nWe had got some distance when the pain in my ankles again came on.  I\r\nasked Martin how he felt.  He confessed that he was suffering in the\r\nsame manner.  \"It won't do to stop, however,\" he observed; \"for these\r\nbrutes, when they have eaten up their friends, will again give chase,\r\nand we shall not be safe till we are inside the walls of the fort.\"\r\n\r\nWe were still several miles from it, and I feared that I should be\r\nutterly unable before long to get over the ground.  Martin encouraged\r\nme, and I persevered, though feeling inclined to drop at every step.  We\r\nhad almost lost sight of the wolves, and I proposed resting for a few\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\n\"We shall be able to make better play afterwards,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"I think it would be wiser to go on,\" he answered; \"but if you wish it,\r\nwe'll sit down and loosen the thongs of our snow-shoes.\"\r\n\r\nWe sat down, and I was induced to take mine off altogether and to rub my\r\nankles, hoping thereby to relieve the pain.  We had not been seated many\r\nminutes when the yelping of the wolves again reached our ears.  Martin,\r\nfastening the thongs, rose to his feet.  \"They are coming on; I was\r\nafraid so,\" he exclaimed.  \"Quick!  David, quick! or they'll overtake\r\nus.\"\r\n\r\nHe assisted me in getting on my shoes--an operation which took some\r\ntime.  I again stood on my feet, but the pain appeared only slightly\r\nlessened.\r\n\r\n\"No time to lose,\" cried Martin, looking back.  \"Now, away we go,\" and\r\nwe ran on as before.\r\n\r\nFast as we went, the brutes came on faster at our heels, and their\r\nhorrible howls sounded louder in our ears.  I felt as I have sometimes\r\ndone in a fearful dream.  I was scarcely able to move over the snow, the\r\npain I was suffering making me fancy that I could not lift my feet;\r\nstill we were really going at a good pace.\r\n\r\nOnce more the wolves got within reach of our rifles.  We acted precisely\r\nas we had done before, and each of us killed a wolf.\r\n\r\nAgain we ran on, reloading our guns ready for another shot.  We\r\nresolved, great as was the pain we were suffering, not again, on any\r\naccount, to stop.  The snarling, yelping sounds emitted by the brutes\r\nshowed us that, as before, they were tearing to pieces the wolves we had\r\nshot.\r\n\r\nWe knew that we could not hope for safety till we were inside the fort,\r\nfor, from the experience we had had on other occasions, we were certain\r\nthat the animals would follow us up to the very walls.  Twice in the\r\nprevious winter they had pursued our hunters till up to the fort itself.\r\nAgain we had to stop and fire.  On this occasion we only killed one\r\nwolf, which, of course, would take the brutes less time than two to\r\ndevour.\r\n\r\nTo our great relief we at length came in sight of the fort, by which\r\ntime the wolves were again on our trail.  We ran on faster than ever,\r\nthough we were both so fatigued that we were afraid, should we again\r\nhave to fire, that we might miss altogether.  We shouted as we\r\napproached to call the attention of our friends.\r\n\r\nFortunately the lookout on one of the towers saw us, and several of the\r\nmen came hurrying out with firearms in their hands.\r\n\r\nSeeing the wolves they advanced shouting.  The animals were, however, so\r\ndirectly behind us that not till we were up to them could they venture\r\nto fire.  They then let fly a volley which killed several, and the rest,\r\nfrightened by the shouts more than by the reports of the guns and the\r\ndeath of their companions, turned tail and scampered off.  Once in\r\nsafety, both of us sank down on the snow, and had to be carried into the\r\nfort.  Even after our snow-shoes were taken off we suffered intense\r\npain, and it was not for some days that either of us was able to walk.\r\n\r\nThe experience we had had made us both resolved to practise with\r\nsnow-shoes before we again attempted to make so long an excursion as we\r\nhad just performed.  The winter wore on.  That season occupies, as most\r\nof my readers must be aware, a large portion of the year in that region.\r\nFor months together--that is to say, from the middle of October till\r\nlate in May--during the whole period, the ground is covered with snow;\r\nthe rivers are frozen over; the trees are leafless; every drop of water\r\nexposed to the air congeals.  The atmosphere is very clear, the air pure\r\nand exhilarating, the sun shines brightly from the unclouded sky, and\r\nwhen no wind is blowing existence out of doors is far from unpleasant.\r\n\r\nParties from the fort were constantly out hunting, and buffalo\r\nfrequently came up close to the very walls.  We have often shot them\r\nfrom the towers.\r\n\r\nRobin was rapidly picking up his recollection of English, and could now\r\nspeak quite fluently.  He was also, from being well fed and clothed,\r\ngradually improving in appearance and strength.  His manners and his\r\ntone of voice were also good.\r\n\r\nI had little doubt from the first that he was of gentle birth.  He was\r\nnot very communicative about his early life, some of his recollections,\r\nindeed, being painful.  I picked up his history, however, by bits and\r\nscraps.\r\n\r\nHe was born in the old country, and had come over when very young with\r\nhis father and mother, Captain and Mrs Grey.  He spoke of a sister\r\nElla, somewhat older than himself; and a little brother Oliver, to whom\r\nhe appeared to be greatly attached.  His parents had removed from either\r\nBoston or New York to one of the western cities, where they lived, I\r\nsuspect, with somewhat straitened means.\r\n\r\nMrs Grey must have been an energetic woman, and had endeavoured, from\r\nwhat I could learn, to support her family by teaching music and other\r\naccomplishments.  Captain Grey, who had been an officer in the army, did\r\nnot appear to have conformed willingly to his changed circumstances, or\r\nto have sought for any employment.  His great delight was shooting and\r\nfishing, and he frequently took out Robin on his excursions, for the\r\nsake, notwithstanding his youth, of his companionship.\r\n\r\nMrs Grey appears to have expostulated with her husband, wishing to keep\r\nRobin at home for the purpose of educating him.  Captain Grey on one\r\noccasion, however, insisted on carrying off his boy, promising to bring\r\nhim back safe.  He had bought a small fowling-piece for him, and wished\r\nto teach him how to use it.  It was natural that Robin should have no\r\nobjection to go, though he was sorry to leave his mother, and brother,\r\nand sister.\r\n\r\n\"Now, my boy, that we are away, we'll make a long trip, and I hope to\r\ncome back with skins enough to pay all our expenses and have a good many\r\ndollars over,\" said the captain, as they started from home.\r\n\r\nThey pushed away westward, crossing several rivers, till they reached\r\nthe very outskirts of the settled districts.  The captain then bought\r\nhorses for Robin and himself, and for their two guides, as also a couple\r\nof baggage animals to carry the skins he expected to obtain.  They\r\nreached the region frequented by buffalo, and succeeded in killing\r\nseveral, as also some deer and other animals.\r\n\r\nRobin said he liked the life well enough, though they had to go through\r\na good deal of hard work.  He became a good horseman, and expert in the\r\nuse of his fowling-piece, so that his father expressed himself highly\r\nproud of him.  Robin could not now remember the names of the places they\r\nvisited; indeed, as he had no map of the country, his geographical\r\nknowledge was, as may be supposed, very imperfect.  His idea was that\r\nall the rivers he saw ran into the ocean.\r\n\r\nAfter hunting for some time, the captain sent his horses with the\r\nproduce of the chase back to a certain place to wait for him, while he\r\ntook it into his head to descend a river in a canoe, manned by three\r\nhalf-breeds, for the sake of shooting wild-fowl.\r\n\r\nThey had gone some distance down, and were steering north or south,\r\nRobin could not recollect which, when they went on shore in the\r\nafternoon to form a camp, where Captain Grey intended to spend the\r\nnight.  Having landed all their stores and put up a wigwam, the captain,\r\nobserving that there was time to shoot some birds, left Robin, who was\r\nnot very well, at the camp with one of the men, while he proceeded some\r\nway farther down the river.\r\n\r\nRobin, having a great wish to obtain some raspberries or bilberries,\r\nwhich were ripe at the time, or some other fruit, while his companion\r\nwas engaged in cooking the supper, wandered away from the camp in search\r\nof them.  It will be better to give Robin's narrative in his own words.\r\n\r\n\"I had filled my hat with fruit of various sorts, thinking how pleased\r\nmy father would be to have some for supper.  The priming had fallen out\r\nof the pan of my gun, which I had taken with me to shoot any birds I\r\nmight see, as also to protect myself from bears or wolves, and I was in\r\nthe act of refilling it when I heard a rustling behind me, and presently\r\nthree Indians sprang out of the bushes, and snatching away my weapon\r\nbefore I had finished the operation, two of them seized me by the hands.\r\n\r\n\"I felt dreadfully alarmed, for they were to my eyes ferocious-looking\r\nfellows, dressed in skins and feathers, with their faces painted all\r\nover in different colours.  I was about to cry out for help, hoping that\r\nmy father might have returned to the camp and would hear me, when the\r\nthird Indian, who had possession of my gun, raising his tomahawk,\r\nthreatened to cut me down if I made any noise.  Without more ado they\r\ndragged me along, but finding that I no longer resisted, did not offer\r\nme any further violence.\r\n\r\n\"These Indians were, I afterwards found, unacquainted with the use of\r\nfirearms.  They allowed me to retain my powder-flask and shot-belt,\r\nlooking upon my weapon, however, with evident respect.  They therefore\r\ndid not injure it, though they took good care not to let me again get it\r\ninto my possession, which, as may be supposed, I was constantly\r\nattempting to do.  One of them carried my hat with the fruit in it for\r\nsome distance, when he emptied the contents out on the ground and\r\nreplaced it on my head.  What their object was in carrying me away I\r\ncould not tell, and it was not till long afterwards that I discovered\r\nit.  Had I known it at the time I should not have been so much\r\nfrightened, for I fully believed that their intention was to kill me.\r\n\r\n\"It appeared that one of them, who was an old man, had a wife with\r\nseveral children by a former husband.  The youngest of these had\r\nrecently died, and she had told her husband that unless he would bring\r\nher back another son to replace the one she had lost, she could not\r\nlive, intimating that she should prefer a white son to a red one.\r\n\r\n\"The old man, whose name was Wamegon--at least that was the first part\r\nof his name, for it was really much longer--had associated with himself\r\nseveral younger men, who had promised to assist him in carrying out the\r\nstrange commands of his wife.\r\n\r\n\"They were on their way eastward for this purpose when they caught sight\r\nof our canoe descending the river, and observing that I was in her,\r\nresolved to take me prisoner.  They had followed the canoe down the bank\r\ntill they saw us land, when they formed the resolution of attacking our\r\ncamp during the night, killing all who opposed them, and carrying me\r\noff.  Fortunately for my father and his companions, I had given the\r\nIndians an opportunity of capturing me without executing the former part\r\nof their intentions.\r\n\r\n\"They dragged me along in no very gentle way, threatening me with\r\ninstant death if I did not keep moving as fast as they wished to go.  It\r\nwas getting rapidly dark, and I hoped that they would be compelled to\r\nstop, for I was sure that my father would come after me.\r\n\r\n\"Had my hands been at liberty, I would have dropped all the articles I\r\nhad in my pocket to assist him in tracing me.  As it was, all I could do\r\nwas to jerk off my hat; but one of the Indians immediately picked it up,\r\nand replaced it on my head.  Whenever we passed any soft ground I\r\nstamped with my feet to leave a deeper impression; but my captors on\r\nperceiving this took off my shoes, perhaps supposing that I could move\r\nfaster without them, and hurried on.\r\n\r\n\"Frightened as I was, I did not altogether lose heart, and resolved to\r\nmake every effort to escape.  We must have gone several miles when two\r\nof the Indians, without taking any supper, lay down, placing me between\r\nthem, with a blanket thrown over all three of us, while the other walked\r\nabout on the watch, to give timely notice should we be pursued.\r\n\r\n\"I was so tired that I soon fell asleep, and did not awaken till dawn\r\nnext morning, when the Indians, holding me tight as before, proceeded on\r\ntheir journey.  They stopped at last and gave me a little dried venison,\r\nmixed with bear's fat, but I could scarcely eat it.\r\n\r\n\"Thus for four days we hurried on due west.  Every night I hoped that I\r\nmight have an opportunity of escaping, but was night after night\r\ncompletely overpowered by sleep.  My bare feet were so wounded and\r\nswollen that at length I could not walk.  Old Wamegon on perceiving this\r\nexamined my feet, and took out a number of thorns and splinters.  He\r\nthen gave me a pair of moccasins, which afforded me some relief.\r\n\r\n\"I now thought that I might perhaps escape.  One night when my\r\ncompanions were asleep I got up, and, snatching my gun, ran off with\r\nnoiseless steps in the direction from which we had come.  I stopped to\r\nprime my piece, intending to fight for my life, as I heard them all\r\nscampering after me; but before I could pour the powder into the pan I\r\nwas overtaken and brought back.  They did not in consequence, however,\r\noffer me any violence, though I expected at least to be well beaten.\r\n\r\n\"The next day we reached a broad river which was too deep to wade\r\nacross.  The old man took me on his shoulders and carried me over, the\r\nwater being high above his waist.  As I knew that I should be unable to\r\nrecross it by myself, I almost gave up all hope of immediately escaping.\r\n\r\n\"It was not till now that I burst into tears; for, thinking that I\r\nshould never again see my father and mother or Ella, or my dear brother\r\nOliver, I felt very sad at heart.\r\n\r\n\"We still continued our journey westward.  One afternoon the Indians\r\nstopped at an earlier hour than usual in a wood.  I saw them looking\r\nabout, when presently they found a large hollow log open at one end.\r\nInto this they put their blankets and bottle and other articles.  They\r\nthen made me crawl in, and closed up the end with logs so firmly that I\r\ncould not possibly break out.  A few minutes only had passed after I had\r\nbeen thus unpleasantly imprisoned, when from the perfect silence which\r\nreigned around I was convinced that they had all gone away.  Had it not\r\nbeen that they had deposited their valuables with me in the log, I\r\nshould have supposed that they intended leaving me to die of starvation.\r\nThough I first entertained this idea, I soon banished it, and after a\r\ntime fell asleep.\r\n\r\n\"When I awoke I was in perfect darkness, and no sounds reached my ears.\r\nAt last I heard the tramp of horses' hoofs.  Immediately the idea\r\noccurred to me that my father had set out on horseback and had traced me\r\nthus far.  I shouted out at the top of my voice, fearing that he might\r\npass the log, ignorant that I was shut up within it.\r\n\r\n\"Presently the pieces of wood which closed the entrance were removed,\r\nand bitter was my disappointment to hear my captors' voices.  Dawn was\r\nalready breaking when they dragged me out.\r\n\r\n\"I found that they had brought a horse a-piece, with another for me to\r\nride on.  Old Wamegon making signs to me to mount, which I did, we set\r\noff at a rapid rate in the same direction as before.\r\n\r\n\"We went on for several days, till we reached an Indian village\r\nconsisting of buffalo-skin wigwams.  Out of one of these an oldish woman\r\nappeared, who, after a short consultation with Wamegon, bade me get off\r\nmy horse, and then, taking me in her arms, covered me with kisses, which\r\nI would very thankfully have avoided.  She was, I found, Netnokwa, my\r\nnew mother.\r\n\r\n\"I felt--and looked, I dare say--very melancholy, and though she\r\nintended to be kind, nothing she said or did raised my spirits.  She\r\nthen took me to her hut and gave me some food, of which I stood greatly\r\nin need.  I slept in the hut during the night.  Next morning after\r\nbreakfast she led me forth to a spot at some distance from the village.\r\nHere all her own people and several strangers from other tribes had\r\nassembled.\r\n\r\n\"It was, I found, the grave of her son, which was enclosed with stakes,\r\nand on each side of it there was a smooth open space.  Here all the\r\npeople took their seats, the family and friends of Netnokwa on one side\r\nand the strangers on the other.\r\n\r\n\"The friends had come provided with presents--pots of sugar, sacks of\r\ncorn, beads, tobacco, and bottles of fire-water.\r\n\r\n\"Some speeches having been made, Netnokwa's friends began to dance round\r\nthe grave, when one of them came up, and taking my hand insisted that I\r\nshould join them.\r\n\r\n\"The dance was very like the usual scalp-dance.  From time to time one\r\nof them came up and presented me with some of the articles they had\r\nbrought; but as I neared the party on the opposite side they were all\r\nsnatched from me, and I was left in the end without anything.  Thus they\r\ncontinued to dance till near nightfall, when, almost dead with fatigue,\r\nI returned with my new mother to the village.\r\n\r\n\"After this we moved further west, the tents and other property of the\r\ntribe being carried partly on horseback and partly by the women, while\r\nthe men rode on ahead without troubling themselves about the fatigue\r\ntheir squaws were suffering.  I was compelled to walk by the side of\r\nNetnokwa.  She was generally very kind, as were her daughters; but the\r\nmen treated me with great harshness, often beating me because I did not\r\nunderstand what they wanted me to do.  I had all sorts of tasks--cutting\r\nwood and bringing water to the camp.\r\n\r\n\"Old Wamegon one day put a bridle into my hand, and pointing in a\r\ncertain direction motioned me to go.  I guessed that he desired me to\r\nbring him a horse, so I caught the first I could find, and to my\r\nsatisfaction discovered that I had done what he intended.\r\n\r\n\"I remembered the words he had used, as I tried to do whenever I was\r\nspoken to, and thus by degrees picked up the language of the people.\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes I accompanied the men out hunting, and had to return to the\r\ncamp with as heavy a load of meat as I could carry.  Though I was almost\r\nstarved, I dared not touch a morsel.\r\n\r\n\"My Indian mother, who showed some compassion for me, would lay by a\r\nlittle food, and give it when the old man was not in the way.  Another\r\nday I felt a blow on the head from behind, and immediately fell\r\nsenseless to the ground.  It was not till many hours afterwards that I\r\nreturned to consciousness, when I saw Netnokwa bathing my head with cold\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n\"The old man coming in exclaimed, `What! is he there?  I thought that I\r\nhad killed him.  He'll not come to life again the next time!'\r\n\r\n\"This remark made me in future carefully avoid the old tyrant.\r\n\r\n\"On reaching a place where deer abounded, the Indians built up a long\r\nscreen of bushes, behind which they concealed themselves, and when any\r\ndeer came near they shot the animals with their arrows.  This was,\r\nhowever, an uncertain mode of obtaining venison.\r\n\r\n\"Some of their more active hunters would go out into the plain, and\r\ncreep up to leeward of any deer they might see, till they could get near\r\nenough to shoot them.  Sometimes when the grass was short they were\r\nunable to conceal themselves.  On such occasions they would lie down\r\nflat on their backs, lifting their legs up in the air so as to resemble\r\nthe branches of a tree.\r\n\r\n\"The deer, who had much curiosity in their nature, would then frequently\r\napproach, now stopping, now drawing nearer, till the hunter would\r\nsuddenly lift his bow, drawing his arrow to let it fly at the nearest\r\nanimal, which would in most instances suffer the penalty of its\r\ninquisitiveness.  Still they often missed.\r\n\r\n\"At one time, when the camp was in great want of venison, I offered to\r\ngo out and shoot some deer.  The young men laughed at me; but I\r\npersuaded the old man to let me have my gun.  At first he refused; but\r\ninduced by Netnokwa, he at last consented, threatening me with severe\r\npunishment if I did not bring back some meat.  It was the first time\r\nthat I had experienced anything like pleasure after being captured by\r\nthe Indians.  When I once more got my weapon into my hand, I resolved to\r\nmake good use of it, and hoped that the time would come when it would\r\nassist me in making my escape.\r\n\r\n\"My Indian mother charged me to be very careful when she saw me setting\r\nout, telling me that she was sure that old Wamegon would carry out his\r\nthreats should I fail to kill a deer.\r\n\r\n\"Withdrawing the charge, I carefully reloaded my gun, and started off.\r\nI had been some hours in the prairie when I caught sight of a herd of\r\nbranch-horned antelopes, which I knew were likely to be attracted by the\r\ndevice I intended to practise.\r\n\r\n\"Creeping on as I had seen the Indians do as far as I could venture, I\r\nlay down on my back, and then slowly lifted my legs in a perpendicular\r\nposition, stretching them out so that I could watch the deer between\r\nthem, while I held my gun ready for instant use.\"\r\n\r\nRobin made us all laugh by going down on his back as he spoke, and\r\nputting himself in the curious attitude he described.  He remained in it\r\nwhile he continued his description:--\r\n\r\n\"The antelopes drew nearer and nearer.  Every moment I was afraid that\r\nthey would grow suspicious and bound away, for they were far more\r\ndifficult to kill, on account of their speed, than other descriptions of\r\ndeer or the buffalo.  They were evidently attracted, however, by the\r\nunusual object they saw on the ground, and advanced towards me.\r\n\r\n\"They were soon within shot, and selecting a fine-looking buck which led\r\nthe way, I fired, and the animal rolled over.  The instant I had pulled\r\nthe trigger I jumped up and began reloading my piece, being thus able to\r\nsend another shot after the herd, which at the report immediately took\r\nto flight.  Fortunately for me the shot took effect on another antelope,\r\nand the animal dropped after going a few paces.\r\n\r\n\"I rushed forward, and with my hunting--knife quickly dispatched both of\r\nthem.  I then took out their tongues, and having partially flayed them,\r\ncut off a haunch from each, and loaded with meat I returned to the camp\r\nin triumph.\r\n\r\n\"The Indians on seeing it could not doubt of my success, and a large\r\nparty instantly set out to bring in the remainder.  After this I was\r\ntreated with much respect by the young men; but old Wamegon seemed still\r\nto have a spite against me, and one morning he even went so far as to\r\ndrag me out by the hair of the head, and, beating me cruelly, threw me\r\ninto some bushes, shouting as he went away that he had finished me at\r\nlast.  I had not, however, lost my senses, and returning to the tent\r\ntold my Indian mother how I had been treated.  I cannot, indeed,\r\ndescribe half the cruelties which that terrible man inflicted on me.\r\n\r\n\"Ofttimes, after the snow had fallen, I was compelled to follow the\r\nhunters, and to drag home to the lodge a whole deer, though they might\r\nhave employed their dogs for the purpose, and it was with the greatest\r\ndifficulty that I could move along.  I had some relief when old Wamegon\r\nwas away.  He was only preparing, however, to cause me greater grief\r\nthan before.\r\n\r\n\"When he came back he exhibited a hat which I recognised as that worn by\r\nmy father.\r\n\r\n\"`We have killed him,' he said, with a horrible laugh.  `You will have\r\nno one now to whom to go should you run away.'\r\n\r\n\"I fully believed that my father was dead, and shed bitter tears at his\r\nloss.  I discovered, however, that what the old man said was false.  My\r\nfather had, as I suspected, pursued me; but while riding on ahead of his\r\nparty, he had been surprised in the wood by Wamegon and the warriors who\r\nhad accompanied him.  They had secured my father to his horse, and\r\nbrought him to their camp.  Here they bound him to a tree, intending to\r\nkill him the next morning.\r\n\r\n\"Though his hands and arms were tied behind him, and there were cords\r\nround his breast and neck, he managed to bite off some of the latter,\r\nwhen he was able to get at a penknife which was in his pocket.  With\r\nthis he cut himself loose, and finding his horse, which was feeding near\r\nat hand, he mounted, and though pursued by the Indians, rode off.\r\n\r\n\"They saw him no more, and he, probably thinking that I was killed,\r\nabandoned the pursuit.  This, however, as I said, I did not learn till\r\nlong afterwards.  Two years passed away, and I still remained in\r\ncaptivity, though never abandoning my intention to try and escape,\r\nhowever little hope I had of succeeding.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIVE.\r\n\r\n\"ARRAH!  NOW, MR.

JACK PIPE--THE\r\nFUGITIVE PARTY--BLACKFEET ON THE WAR-PATH--THE FORT IS BESIEGED--ROBIN'S\r\nCOURAGEOUS PROPOSAL--HE STARTS TO WARN SANDY.\r\n\r\nSome time after Robin had arrived, one evening an Indian was seen\r\napproaching the fort.\r\n\r\nThe gate, as was our custom at that time of day, had just been closed,\r\nto prevent the risk of surprise, as there was sufficient cover in the\r\nneighbourhood to conceal a body of enemies, who might have taken it into\r\ntheir heads to try to possess themselves of our property.\r\n\r\nAs the stranger, however, came boldly up to the gate, it was supposed by\r\nPat Casey, who was on watch, that he could have no sinister intentions;\r\nstill, Pat, wishing to be on the safe side, shouted out, \"Arrah! now,\r\nMr Injun, whoever you may be, halt now, and tell us your name and\r\nbusiness.\"\r\n\r\nThough the Indian could not have understood a word Pat said, he guessed\r\nthe meaning of the hail.  I, hearing Pat shout, joined him, when the\r\nstranger replied in his own language, \"I am Miskwandib.  I received a\r\nkindness from a young pale-face some time back, and come to return it.\"\r\n\r\nOn hearing what the stranger said, I recognised him as \"Copper-Snake,\"\r\nto whom I had given a portion of food when Pat and I had lost ourselves.\r\nI immediately went down with Pat to admit him.  He knew me at once, and\r\nentering the gate without hesitation, took my hand.\r\n\r\n\"I am glad to find that you have got safe back to your friends,\" he\r\nsaid.  \"I knew that you had, for I tracked your footsteps, that I might\r\nbe able to guard you from danger.  My people never forget a kindness\r\nreceived, and wishing to show my gratitude, I now come to warn you that\r\nthere are those on the war-path who will before long attempt to take\r\nyour fort, and possess themselves of the arms and powder and shot, and\r\nthe rest of your property in it.  They are cunning as the foxes, and it\r\nmay be soon or it may be some moons hence before they appear, and\r\nthey'll take good care not to give you warning.  Miskwandib has spoken\r\nthe truth.\"\r\n\r\n\"I feel very sure that you have, my friend,\" I observed; \"and I'll get\r\nyou to repeat your account to my brother.\"  Copper-Snake willingly\r\naccompanied me, and I introduced him to Alick, who, after he had offered\r\nhim some food and a pipe, requested him to repeat all he had said to me.\r\nHe gave also further particulars which induced us fully to believe that\r\nhe spoke the truth.\r\n\r\nAlick invited him to remain during the night, as he looked thin and\r\nfatigued.  He gladly accepted the invitation, and was greatly delighted\r\nwhen Alick presented him with a musket and some ammunition.\r\n\r\n\"I shall have no more fear of starving,\" he exclaimed, as he eyed the\r\nweapon.  \"I can now kill buffalo and deer, and defend myself too against\r\nall my enemies.\"\r\n\r\nAltogether, Alick was satisfied that the Copper-Snake, though his name\r\nwas not significant of good qualities, was an honest man, and he\r\nconsequently advised him to come with his family and settle near the\r\nfort.\r\n\r\nThe Indian replied \"that he would think about the matter, but that\r\nthough some of the pale-faces he had met with were good men, there were\r\namong them many bad ones, and that he had hitherto preferred keeping at\r\na distance from them.\"\r\n\r\nHe showed, however, no suspicion of us, and lay down to sleep in a\r\ncorner of the hall, making himself perfectly at home.\r\n\r\nThe next morning at daybreak, after he had received as much as he could\r\ncarry, with his newly-acquired gun in his hand he took his departure.\r\n\r\nAlick and I considered that Copper-Snake's warning should be attended\r\ntoo, and that every necessary precaution should be taken to avoid\r\nsurprise.  Sandy, however, was of opinion that he had come with a\r\ncock-and-bull story for the sake of gaining credit for the information,\r\nand thus getting something out of us, as he had succeeded in doing.\r\n\r\nSome days passed by, and as no enemy appeared, nor did we hear of one\r\nbeing in the neighbourhood, we began to think that Sandy was right, and\r\ngradually our vigilance decreased, till we no longer took any unusual\r\nprecautions against a sudden attack.\r\n\r\nI must continue Robin's narrative, though, as I said, I only picked it\r\nup piecemeal, as he was in the humour to talk about past events.  He had\r\nnot been so long among the Indians without acquiring somewhat of their\r\nmanner and reticence.  I had, indeed, to pump him to draw out what I\r\nwanted to know.  He was more communicative generally to Martin, to whom\r\nhe had taken a great liking from the first.\r\n\r\n\"Did you ever expect to become like an Indian, and to be contented with\r\nyour lot?\"  I asked.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he answered, \"I did not.  I always remembered that I was an\r\nEnglishman, and resolved to make my escape if I could.  I had won the\r\nconfidence of Netnokwa, and the young men respected me for my skill in\r\nhunting.  At length my powder and shot came to an end, and I could no\r\nlonger use my gun.  I tried to shoot with a bow and arrows, but it was\r\nlong before I attained anything like the skill possessed by the Indians,\r\nwho are accustomed to practise with a bow from their earliest days.  I\r\nsank, consequently, in the estimation of the tribe.  My great wish was\r\nto obtain some more ammunition; but the Indians always prevented me from\r\ncommunicating with any white men, from whom alone I could have got it.\r\n\r\n\"We continued moving farther and farther west, till we met a tribe of\r\nIndians with whom we had never before come in contact.  They were far\r\nbetter mounted than our people, and looked much more savage.  They were\r\nSioux, and from several articles I saw among them I knew that they must\r\nhave been in communication with the fur-traders.\r\n\r\n\"They appeared to be on friendly terms, however, with Netnokwa's people.\r\nI had soon cause to be sorry for this, as I found that one of their\r\nchiefs, Shegaw by name, was bargaining to purchase me for his wife, who\r\nhad lost a son, as Netnokwa had done.  He offered some blankets,\r\ntobacco, beads, and knives; but Netnokwa would not accept them.\r\n\r\n\"`No,' I heard her say; `I have lost one son, but I will not willingly\r\nlose another.'\r\n\r\n\"Shegaw, however, persevered, and at length appeared at our wigwam\r\nfollowed by several men carrying a ten-gallon keg of whisky, besides the\r\nblankets and other things he had offered.  This was more than Netnokwa\r\ncould withstand, especially when old Wamegon came in and declared that\r\nhe would kill me if she refused it.\r\n\r\n\"The exchange was at once made.  I was handed over to Shegaw, and the\r\nwhole of Wamegon's tribe set to work to drink up the spirits.  They were\r\nnot long in doing that.  When last I saw my Indian mother and tyrannical\r\nold father, they both lay on the ground helplessly tipsy.  It was not a\r\nvery edifying spectacle, but I was very well aware that my new owners\r\nwould, should an opportunity occur, reduce themselves to the same\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\n\"I made all the inquiries I could respecting the country and the rivers\r\nrunning through it, that I might know in what direction to go should I\r\neffect my escape.\r\n\r\n\"How my new mother would treat me it was impossible to say, but I\r\nthought from Shegaw's appearance that I should not be much better off\r\nunder him than I had been while living with old Wamegon.\r\n\r\n\"The tribes now separated, my new owners moving westward, while the\r\nothers returned towards the east.  It was considered a wonderful thing\r\nthat they should have met without coming to blows.  The farther west\r\nthey went, the less hope I had of making my escape, because, even should\r\nI get away from my present masters, I should in all probability fall\r\ninto the hands of those who had sold me.\r\n\r\n\"After travelling several days we reached Shegaw's lodges.  Making me\r\ndismount, he led me by the hand to his own dwelling, where he presented\r\nme in due form to his wife, Kezha.  She was much younger and\r\nbetter-looking than my former mother, and, I thought, had a more amiable\r\nexpression of countenance.  Thus far I had changed for the better.\r\n\r\n\"I soon found, however, that I was not to eat the bread of idleness; for\r\nI was employed in cutting wood, attending to the fires, and bringing\r\nwater to the camp.  Though Kezha herself did not beat me, she could not\r\nprevent others from doing so.\r\n\r\n\"The tribe with whom I was now living were great hunters; as they were\r\nconstantly engaged in the sport, food was plentiful among us, and we did\r\nnot suffer from the extremes of famine which many others are doomed to\r\nbear, in consequence of their neglecting to cultivate the ground.  They\r\nalso preserved and laid by a store of provisions for the time when deer\r\nor buffalo might become scarce.\r\n\r\n\"The abundance in which they lived made them despise other people and\r\nindulge in many vices.  Whenever liquor could be procured, they took it\r\nto excess, and I had good reason to be afraid that in some of their\r\ndrunken fits they would take it into their heads to kill me.  They were\r\nalso greatly addicted to gambling.  They had a variety of games; one was\r\nthat of the moccasin.  It is played by a number of persons, divided into\r\ntwo parties.  In one of four moccasins a little stick or small piece of\r\ncloth is concealed.  The moccasins are then laid down by the side of\r\neach other in a row, and one of the adverse party touches two of the\r\nmoccasins.\r\n\r\n\"If the one he first touches has the thing hidden in it, the player\r\nloses eight to the opposite party; if it is not in the second, but in\r\none of the two passed over, he loses two; if it is not in the one he\r\ntouches first, and is in the last, he wins eight.  The articles staked\r\nare valued by agreement.  A beaver-skin or a blanket is valued at ten;\r\nsometimes a horse at one hundred.\r\n\r\n\"There is another game played with circular counters, one side of them\r\nbeing plain, while the other is painted black.  Generally nine are used,\r\nbut never fewer.  They are put together on a large wooden bowl, which is\r\nplaced upon a blanket, when the two parties playing, numbering perhaps\r\nthirty people, sit down in a circle.  The game consists in striking the\r\nedge of the bowl so as to throw all the counters into the air, and on\r\nthe manner in which they fall upon the blanket or into the bowl depends\r\nthe player's gain or loss.  If the player is fortunate in the first\r\ninstance, he strikes again and again until he misses, when it is passed\r\non to the next.  So excited do the Indians become that they often\r\nquarrel desperately.  They will play on at this game for hours together,\r\ntill they have staked everything they possess.\r\n\r\n\"On one occasion Shegaw, who considered me as one of his goods and\r\nchattels, staked me, and I was lost to a Cree chief.\r\n\r\n\"My Indian mother, on hearing that I had been staked and lost with other\r\nproperty, cried very much, and declared that she would not agree to my\r\nbeing given up.  On this Shegaw, who was afraid of offending her, agreed\r\nto challenge the other Indians to a fresh game, and to stake several\r\npacks of peltries, the whole of our remaining property.\r\n\r\n\"I stood by, watching the game with some anxiety; not that it signified\r\nvery much to me who became my master.  Our party won, and I was restored\r\nto Kezha.  It was only for a short time, however.  She was as fond of\r\nthe fire-water as are many other Indian women, and when once she began\r\nto drink she would give everything she possessed to obtain more liquor.\r\nFor a short time she made more of me than she had hitherto done.\r\n\r\n\"I managed to regain, too, my credit with the young men of the tribe.  I\r\nhad obtained a bow and arrows, and by constantly practising, became\r\ntolerably expert.  During the winter I was allowed to go out by myself,\r\nfor the Indians could always trace me, and they knew well that I could\r\nnot travel far should I attempt to make my escape.\r\n\r\n\"I was one day crossing a small meadow, an open space encircled by\r\ntrees, when I unexpectedly fell up to the middle into the snow.  I\r\neasily extricated myself and walked on; but remembering that I had heard\r\nthe Indians speak of killing bears in their holes, it occurred to me\r\nthat it might be a bear's hole into which I had fallen.  I accordingly\r\nreturned, and looking down into it, I saw the head of a bear lying close\r\nto the bottom of the hole.  Had I gone down farther I should have fallen\r\ninto his very jaws.\r\n\r\n\"He did not appear to be inclined to move, so fixing an arrow in my bow,\r\nI shot it with all my force into the animal's head between the eyes.\r\nImmediately I had done so I got another arrow ready, but on looking down\r\nI saw that the bear did not move.  I ran to the wood and cut a long\r\nstick, and returning with it thrust it into the bear's eyes.  As the\r\ncreature still remained perfectly quiet, I was convinced that it was\r\ndead, and stooping down, endeavoured to lift it out of the hole.\r\n\r\n\"Being unable to do this, I returned home, following the track I had\r\nmade in coming out.  As I neared the tent I saw a fire burning and a pot\r\nboiling on it.\r\n\r\n\"`Here, my son, is some beaver meat which we have obtained since you\r\nwent out in the morning,' said my mother.\r\n\r\n\"Having eaten some, for I was very hungry, I whispered to Kezha, `I have\r\nkilled a bear.'\r\n\r\n\"`What do you say, my son?' she asked.\r\n\r\n\"`I have killed a bear,' I replied.\r\n\r\n\"`Are you sure that it is dead?'\r\n\r\n\"`Yes,' I answered, `it is quite dead.'\r\n\r\n\"On this my so-called mother seized me in her arms, and began hugging\r\nand kissing me.\r\n\r\n\"The bear was sent for, and as it was the first I had killed, it was\r\ncooked, and the hunters of the whole band invited to feast with us,\r\naccording to Indian custom.\r\n\r\n\"The next day another bear and a moose were killed, and for some time we\r\nhad an abundance of food.  Old Kezha had another adopted son, Muskgo.\r\nHe and I used to go out hunting together.  I suspect that he was set to\r\nwatch over me, though we were on very friendly terms.\r\n\r\n\"We frequently hunted two or three days' distance from the camp, but\r\nwere very often unsuccessful, when we were almost starved.  On one of\r\nour hunting-paths we had formed a hut of cedar boughs, in which we had\r\nkindled fire so often that at length it became very dry.  We were lying\r\ndown at night, after an unsuccessful day's hunt, when we lighted a fire\r\nto keep ourselves warm, for the weather was intensely cold.  We had just\r\ndropped off to sleep when some of the sparks blown by the wind caught\r\nthe cedar, which immediately flew up like powder.  Happily we scampered\r\nout without suffering much, but we were left till daylight without any\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\n\"At dawn we set off towards the camp, hoping that some of the other\r\nhunters would have been more successful than we were.  So intense was\r\nthe cold that the trees as we passed were constantly cracking with\r\nfrost.  We had soon to cross a river which appeared to be frozen over\r\nhard, but when we had got a little distance from the shore the ice gave\r\nway, and I fell in.  At the same moment Muskgo broke through in the same\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n\"I kept upright, and only wetted my feet and legs; but he threw himself\r\ndown, and was wetted nearly all over.  Our hands being benumbed with the\r\ncold, it was some time before we could get off our snow-shoes, and we\r\nwere no sooner out of the water than our moccasins and leggings were\r\nfrozen stiff.  Our spunk wood got wetted by the water, and when we at\r\nlast reached the shore we were unable to light a fire.  Our clothes also\r\nwere so completely frozen that we could scarcely move.\r\n\r\n\"Muskgo was in such pain that he at once gave in and declared that he\r\nshould die.  I held out, for though I had no enjoyment in the existence\r\nI was enduring, I still hoped some day to make my escape.  I therefore\r\nkept moving about as well as I was able, and at length reaching the\r\nforest, found some rotten wood which I used as a substitute for spunk,\r\nand was able, greatly to my satisfaction, to raise a fire.\r\n\r\n\"We immediately set to work to thaw and dry our moccasins, and having\r\nput them on, we had strength to collect more fuel for a larger fire.\r\nLying close to this, we completely dried our clothes; and though we had\r\nnothing to eat we did not complain, since we had the enjoyment of\r\nwarmth.\r\n\r\n\"Next morning again setting out we proceeded towards the lodges.  We\r\nwere still some way from them when we met old Kezha bringing us some\r\nfood and dry clothes.  She said that `knowing we should have the river\r\nto cross, as we did not appear she was convinced that we had fallen\r\nthrough the ice.'  It will thus be seen that the old woman had a kind\r\nheart, though her temper was very uncertain.\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes we had an abundance of food in the camp; at others for many\r\ndays together we were almost starved, and had only nuts or berries to\r\nfeed on.  I cannot describe one-tenth part of the incidents of my life\r\nat this period.\r\n\r\n\"We had again accumulated several packages of peltries, which it was\r\nintended to exchange with the fur-traders for blankets and numerous\r\nother articles of which the tribe were in want.\r\n\r\n\"One day, however, another party of Indians, under a chief called\r\n`Peshauba,' or the `Crooked Lightning,' came and encamped near us.  He\r\nhad been trading successfully with the white men, and had a large supply\r\nof blankets, beads, knives, and several casks of fire-water.\r\n\r\n\"He came into our camp bringing with him a bottle full of the\r\nfire-water.  He offered some to Kezha.  She at first refused, but at\r\nlength was induced to take a cupful.  I watched her as she swallowed it,\r\nwhen her eyes began to roll, and, stretching out her hand with the cup,\r\nshe begged to have it refilled.  This Peshauba willingly did, and cup\r\nafter cup was swallowed till not a drop remained.  She begged to have\r\nsome more; but Peshauba replied that he could not give it without\r\npayment, and that he would only sell a whole cask.  She at once offered\r\nhim all the beaver-skins and a large quantity of buffalo-robes.\r\n\r\n\"Still he was not content, and insisted on having me and several other\r\narticles.  She cried with vexation, but at last, finding she could not\r\nobtain the fire-water, she exclaimed, `Take them all, but only bring me\r\nthe rum.'\r\n\r\n\"Peshauba got up and, without saying a word, returned to his own camp.\r\nHe was not long absent, and came back with a party of his young men, who\r\ncarried the cask of rum.  On depositing it they lifted up the bales and\r\nother property which they had taken in exchange, and walked off with\r\nthem, Peshauba leading me by the hand.  I knew that there was no use in\r\nmaking any resistance, though I felt very indignant at being thus bought\r\nand sold.\r\n\r\n\"I was sorry, too, at leaving old Kezha, who, although now presenting a\r\nvery melancholy spectacle as she lay rolling helplessly on the ground,\r\nhad yet been kind to me on many occasions, and I was not likely to be\r\nbetter treated by any one else.\r\n\r\n\"It is not the custom of the Indians, however, to trade in slaves;\r\nindeed, I was not looked upon as one exactly, but rather as a new member\r\nof the family.  The idea of making slaves of their fellow-creatures is\r\nentirely contrary to the nature of the Indians.  They will either kill\r\ntheir enemies or let them go, or, if they wish it, receive them into\r\ntheir tribe on equal terms.  I had to obey Peshauba as a son obeys his\r\nfather.  He and his wife treated me with considerable kindness.\r\n\r\n\"We moved away westward when my former friends turned back towards the\r\nRed River.  I was allowed as much freedom as before, and as I had become\r\na tolerably good hunter, was sent out by myself.  On one occasion\r\nPeshauba sent me out to bring in the meat of an elk which he had killed,\r\naccompanied by two girls.  Finding the animal large and fat, they\r\ndetermined on remaining to dry the meat, that they might have the less\r\nweight to carry.  I, knowing it would be wiser to obey the order I had\r\nreceived, took up my load and started for home.\r\n\r\n\"Observing several elk as I went along, I resolved to try and kill one\r\nof them.  Hiding myself in a bush, therefore, I imitated the call of the\r\nfemale elk.  Presently a large buck came bounding so furiously towards\r\nthe spot where I was concealed that, seeing he would break through the\r\nbush, I dropped my load and took to flight.  No sooner did he observe\r\nme, however, than he turned round and fled in the opposite direction.\r\n\r\n\"As I should have been laughed at for my fright, I returned, wishing to\r\nkill an elk.  I again imitated the cry, and after some time another\r\nanimal came towards me, so cautiously that I was able to shoot him dead.\r\nAs I could now make my appearance at the camp with some credit, I took\r\nup my load and proceeded homewards, intending to return with others for\r\nthe flesh of the elk I had killed.\r\n\r\n\"I had gone some distance when I saw what I took to be a bear.  At first\r\nI believed it to be a common black bear, and prepared to try and shoot\r\nit.  When, however, the creature continued to advance, I supposed that\r\nit must be a grizzly, as a common bear would have fled.  I therefore\r\nturned, and began to run from the beast; but the more swiftly I ran, the\r\nmore closely it followed.\r\n\r\n\"Though much frightened, I remembered the advice Peshauba had given me--\r\nnever to attempt shooting one of these animals unless trees were near\r\ninto which I could climb; also, in case of being pursued, never to shoot\r\nuntil the creature was close to me.\r\n\r\n\"Three times I turned and prepared to let fly an arrow, but each time\r\nthe bear was still too far off, so I again turned and ran on.  Thus I\r\ncontinued till I got close to the lodges, when what was my surprise, on\r\nlooking back, to see old Peshauba himself!  He had on a bearskin cloak,\r\nthe hood of which he had thrown over his head, thus making himself,\r\naided by the dusk and my fright, resemble a real bear.  He laughed\r\nheartily at my alarm, but commended me for having obeyed his\r\ninstructions.  My conduct, though I had not exhibited any great amount\r\nof bravery, greatly raised me in his estimation.  Supposing that I had\r\nbecome reconciled to my lot, he allowed me even greater liberty than at\r\nfirst, and many months passed by spent in hunting, and sometimes by the\r\nyoung warriors in going on the war-path against their enemies.  We had\r\nmoved a long way to the westward, when, being encamped on the plain, I\r\nwent out with several companions on a hunting expedition towards the\r\nnorth.  At the extreme limit of our excursion we found a stream which I\r\nlearned ran down into a larger river, and I was told that that river\r\nflowed on for hundreds of miles towards the ocean.\r\n\r\n\"On hearing this, the thought seized me that I might possibly by its\r\nmeans make my escape.  We had several times been encamped in the\r\nneighbourhood of rivers and lakes, on which I had learned how to manage\r\na canoe.\r\n\r\n\"A long time elapsed, however, before I could carry my plan into\r\nexecution.  Though I several times visited the river on my hunting\r\nexcursions, I could not find a canoe; though I might have built one, I\r\nshould to a certainty have been overtaken before I could finish it.  I\r\ncannot describe all the events which occurred in the meantime.  I was\r\noften ill-treated, both by Peshauba and other members of the tribe, and\r\noften, when game was scarce, almost starved.\r\n\r\n\"At last I managed to get away from the camp with a small supply of meat\r\nwhich I had secreted, and making a wide circuit, proceeded towards the\r\nriver.  I hoped that I was not pursued, and that it would be supposed I\r\nhad only gone out with the intention of hunting.  Reaching the stream, I\r\ncontinued down it, examining both banks in the hopes of finding a canoe\r\nof some description.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot express the delight I felt when I discovered a small one\r\nhauled up on the shore.  It belonged, I concluded, to some Crees we had\r\nmet with.  As I could find no traces of the owners, I at once launched\r\nit, and seizing the paddle, shoved off from the bank.  The current\r\ncarried me swiftly along.  I had got to some distance when I heard a\r\nvoice calling to me; but I could not have returned against the current,\r\neven had I wished it.  I continued my course, therefore, till darkness\r\ncame on, when I landed, and, hauling up my canoe, slipped under it.\r\n\r\n\"The next morning, as soon as there was a gleam of light, I started off\r\nagain, stopping only to eat some of the small supply of food I had\r\nbrought with me.  I had my bow and arrows, and I hoped to replenish the\r\nstock on my way.\r\n\r\n\"Not wishing to exhaust all the food I possessed before I had obtained\r\nsome to supply its place, I one day landed, with the intention of trying\r\nto shoot some birds or animals.  Seeing no signs of any one having\r\nvisited the spot, I hauled up the canoe on the bank, and went off into\r\nthe wood.\r\n\r\n\"What was my dismay, on returning, to find my canoe gone!  I saw tracks\r\non the ground which puzzled me exceedingly, as I was nearly certain that\r\nthey were not those of an Indian, though I could not surmise who had\r\nformed them.  I was almost in despair, believing that I should have\r\nperhaps hundreds of miles to travel on foot, and might be unable to kill\r\nsufficient game to support existence; still, plucking up courage, I\r\nresolved to persevere, and was making my way, as far as I could\r\ncalculate, to the north-east, when I saw a person approaching the spot\r\nin which I was hiding myself.\r\n\r\n\"I could see through the bushes, and great was my joy to discover that\r\nhe was a white man.  On this I immediately showed myself.  Though I had\r\ngreat difficulty in understanding what he said, so long a time had\r\npassed since I had heard English spoken, yet I quickly made out that he\r\nwished to conduct me to a place where I should find my own countrymen.\r\n\r\n\"As you may have guessed, my new friend was Sandy McTavish.\"\r\n\r\nSuch is a brief outline of Robin's narrative.  He told us several other\r\nevents of his life, and observed that there were many more which he had\r\nnot mentioned, and which we only heard at intervals afterwards.  He\r\nbecame very much attached to us all, and he himself was a great\r\nfavourite with every one in the fort; indeed Alick and I looked upon\r\nMartin and him as brothers, and few brothers could have regarded each\r\nother with greater affection than we did.\r\n\r\nStill Robin was anxious to set out, in the hopes of rejoining his\r\nparents and assuring them of his existence.  They might have supposed\r\nthat he had been killed, or perhaps, as was the case, that he had merely\r\nbeen kept in captivity.\r\n\r\nHis great fear was that his father might have lost his life in\r\nattempting his recovery, and should such have happened, he thought of\r\nall the sorrow his poor mother must have endured for their sakes.  Still\r\nsome time went by, but no opportunity occurred of sending him on to Fort\r\nGarry, the nearest place from which he would be able to make his way in\r\nsafety to the States.  As he did not remember the name of the town in\r\nwhich his mother was living, he would still have great difficulty in\r\nfinding her.\r\n\r\n\"I must beg my way through the country till I can do so, but while I\r\nlive I will not abandon the search,\" he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"You shall not have to do that,\" observed Alick.  \"All the means I\r\npossess shall be at your disposal, and I feel sure that others when they\r\nhear your history will gladly subscribe to assist you.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I may never be able to repay you,\" said Robin.\r\n\r\n\"I shall not expect repayment,\" answered Alick.  \"What I have shall be\r\nfreely yours, and if you ever have the power of returning the money, and\r\nI happen to want it, I will trust to you to do so.\"\r\n\r\nThe spring was advancing; the snow disappeared as the sun got hotter and\r\nhotter, and the ice broke up in the river and went rushing downwards,\r\nhuge masses tumbling over each other, grinding together till they became\r\nsmall pieces and quickly melted away.\r\n\r\nThe grass grew up, the wild flowers bloomed--no others are to be seen in\r\nthat region--the leaves burst forth, and the forests once more assumed\r\ntheir mantle of green.\r\n\r\nWe were all actively engaged--some in cultivating a field of Indian\r\ncorn, another of potatoes, and a kitchen garden in a sheltered spot near\r\nthe fort.  Our chief business, however, was hunting; for though some\r\nanimals are killed in the winter, many more are shot in the spring and\r\nsummer.  We have a spring, though vegetation proceeds so rapidly, when\r\nonce the winter has taken its departure, that it is a very short one,\r\nand rushes, as it were, rapidly into summer.\r\n\r\nThe trappers were away with their traps to catch beaver.  Nearly all\r\nother animals are of value--bears, badgers, squirrels, foxes, hares,\r\nrabbits, opossums, otters, minks, martens, raccoons, skunks, musk rats,\r\nand weasels--but the beaver is one of the most valuable.  We one evening\r\nhad returned after a shooting excursion to the fort, when an Indian,\r\nfollowed by two squaws carrying a couple of packs of skins, was seen\r\napproaching.  Alick went out to meet him, and invited him in, with the\r\nintention of purchasing the peltries, supposing that his object in\r\ncoming was to sell them.\r\n\r\nHe declined allowing the squaws to enter the fort, but when invited came\r\nwillingly himself.  Though he spoke the Cree language, he had more the\r\nappearance of a Sioux.\r\n\r\nSandy, who was within at the time, warned Alick not to trust him.  He\r\nset a high price on his peltries, and said that he would only sell them\r\nfor arms and ammunition, as he had blankets and cloth enough in his\r\nlodge for all his wants; he required six muskets and a large stock of\r\npowder and shot.\r\n\r\nWe were not absolutely prohibited from selling muskets to the Indians,\r\nbut our instructions were to try to induce them to take blankets, cloth,\r\ntobacco, beads, and cutlery.\r\n\r\n\"But you are alone, my friend, and can require but one gun for\r\nyourself,\" said Alick.\r\n\r\nOn this the Indian got up and made a long speech.  I should have said\r\nthat he had announced himself as Opoihgun, \"a pipe;\" on hearing which\r\nSandy at once dubbed him \"Jack Pipe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Opoihgun is not alone,\" he began; \"he has many young men who follow\r\nhim, who desire guns to supply themselves and their squaws and children\r\nwith buffalo meat and venison.  They know how to clothe themselves with\r\nthe skins of the animals they kill, and despise those people who wear\r\nblankets and cloth garments.  What Opoihgun has said he intends to keep\r\nto.  If his pale-face friends have no guns or ammunition, they cannot\r\nhope to obtain his peltries.  He has spoken, and is like those mountains\r\nin the far west, not to be moved.  Lift them up and bring them here, and\r\nhe will part with his skins for nothing.\"\r\n\r\nHe went on talking for some time in the same strain.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Mr Pipe, but suppose you take three guns and the remainder of\r\nthe price either in blankets or in tobacco, will that not content you?\"\r\nasked Alick.\r\n\r\nOpoihgun, who was smoking, puffed a cloud from his mouth, and pointing\r\nto the west said, \"Bring those mountains here.\"\r\n\r\nWe knew by this that he did not intend to change his mind.  Had Alick\r\nconsented to do what is done too often--produce some bottles of whisky--\r\nhe would very probably have obtained the peltries on his own terms.  To\r\ndo this was entirely contrary to his principles.  We had some whisky in\r\nthe fort, but it was dealt out in small quantities only to those who\r\nrequired it.\r\n\r\nThough the company instructed their factors not on any account to sell\r\nwhisky to the Indians, it somehow or other found its way into the forts,\r\nand by the same unaccountable means the Indians very frequently got\r\ndrunk, and parted with the produce of their long days and nights of\r\nhunting, receiving very small value in return.\r\n\r\nMr Meredith and Alick had never fallen into the abominable practice of\r\nmaking those with whom they were about to trade drunk, but always gave\r\nfair value for the peltries they received; consequently the more soberly\r\ndisposed Indians resorted to our fort in preference to others which they\r\nmight in many cases have more easily reached.\r\n\r\nMr Pipe, though he first only asked for the guns and ammunition, now\r\nincreased his demands, and begged to have some tobacco, and ornaments\r\nfor his squaws.  Alick promised the latter, and advised him to trust to\r\nhis generosity about other things.  At length the bargain was concluded,\r\nand the packs being brought in and found to contain the skins the Indian\r\nhad stated, the guns, powder, and shot were handed to him.  Doing them\r\nup into two packages, he placed them on the backs of the two women, and\r\nordered them to march, promising soon to overtake them.  Alick suggested\r\nthat it was imprudent to send them without protection.  On this Mr Pipe\r\nlaughed, grimly observing \"that they knew how to take care of\r\nthemselves, and that no one would venture to molest them.\"\r\n\r\nHe then returned into the fort, and after smoking another pipe, got up\r\nand went round the place, carefully examining every portion, looking\r\ninto the stores and the huts and round the walls.  We had at the time no\r\nsuspicion of his object, but thought that he was only prompted by\r\ncuriosity.  At length, as evening was approaching, he bade us farewell,\r\nsaying that he should overtake his squaws by the time they had encamped\r\nfor the night.\r\n\r\nThe next morning Martin, Robin, and I had agreed to go out on a shooting\r\nexpedition! in order to obtain some wild-fowl, which had assembled in\r\ngreat numbers on a lagoon, a short distance from the fort, near the\r\nriver.  We had concealed ourselves in some bushes, hoping that the\r\nwild-fowl would come in the course of their flight sufficiently near to\r\nenable us to shoot them.  We had remained in ambush for some time, and\r\nwere feeling somewhat disappointed at our want of success, when who\r\nshould we see but Opoihgun stealing by out of a wood.  He had taken off\r\nmost of his clothes, and his black hair was streaming over his back.  He\r\nlooked about cautiously, as if he expected some one to meet him.\r\n\r\nJust at that moment up flew a covey of wild-fowl, when Martin,\r\nforgetting that it might be of importance to ascertain what Mr Pipe was\r\nabout, fired at one of the birds, which, however, flew off uninjured.\r\n\r\nThe Indian looked round with a startled expression of countenance,\r\nsupposing apparently that the shot was fired at him, and ran off fleet\r\nas a deer towards the narrow part of the lagoon, across which it was\r\nevident he intended to make his way.  We started up from our ambush; but\r\nthough he again looked round, and saw us, he only fled the faster.\r\n\r\n\"I say, David, I believe that fellow came here with no good intentions,\"\r\nobserved Martin.  \"I vote we give chase and make him tell us what he was\r\nabout.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know more about the Indian customs than I do, Robin.  What do you\r\nsay?\"  I asked.\r\n\r\n\"He was here for some bad purpose,\" answered Robin; \"but I would advise\r\nyou not to follow him.  He has friends in the neighbourhood.  We may\r\ndepend on that, and they may set upon us if we go far from the fort.  As\r\nI was watching his countenance yesterday, it struck me that I had seen\r\nhim before, and I am nearly certain that he's a friend of Peshauba's\r\nfrom whom I made my escape.  As I saw him again to-day I felt more\r\ncertain than ever, and I suspect that one of his objects was to get me\r\nback, though, as I do not think he recognised me yesterday, perhaps he\r\nfancied that I was not at the fort.\"\r\n\r\nRobin was so positive on the matter that we thought it advisable not to\r\nfollow the Indian.  We accordingly retreated towards the fort, though\r\nvery unwilling to return without some ducks for dinner.\r\n\r\nWhen we told Alick what had occurred, he approved of our conduct.\r\n\r\n\"There was something not altogether canny about Mr Pipe,\" observed\r\nSandy, \"and I am very glad no harm happened to you boys.\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't like the man's countenance, and suspected his intentions from\r\nthe first,\" said Alick; \"however, I could not refuse to trade with him,\r\nthough it's more than probable that he stole the peltries he brought us.\r\nWe'll send out and try to find out more about him.\"\r\n\r\nBesides the old Scotchman there were fortunately six hunters at the\r\nfort, who were immediately dispatched, well armed, under Sandy's\r\ncommand, to follow the trail of Opoihgun, and to ascertain where he had\r\ngone and what he was about.\r\n\r\nAlick would not let any of us accompany the party, considering that it\r\nwould be useless to expose us to the danger we might have to encounter.\r\n\r\nWhile they were away we caught sight of a small band of men in the\r\ndistance coming towards the fort from the south-west.  As they got\r\nnearer we saw that there were six persons.\r\n\r\n\"They are Indians, and seem in a great hurry from the way they come\r\nalong,\" observed Martin, who was with Robin and me on the top of the\r\ntower.\r\n\r\n\"They do not appear to me to be Indians from the way they run,\" said\r\nRobin.  \"I should say that most of them are half-breeds, though there is\r\none of them who looks like an Indian.\"\r\n\r\nI thought that they were all Indians, though they had no war-plumes, and\r\nI saw no ornaments glittering in the sun.\r\n\r\n\"Whatever they are, they seem very anxious to reach the fort,\" said\r\nMartin.  \"We'll soon know the truth of the matter, for they must be here\r\nbefore long.\"\r\n\r\nAs the strangers approached, we caught sight in the far distance of\r\nanother party far more numerous, who appeared to be coming on as fast as\r\nthe others were; still the latter were certain to reach the fort some\r\ntime before them.\r\n\r\nUpon informing Alick, who was in his room, he said at once that the\r\nsmaller party were flying from the others, evidently hoping to obtain\r\nrefuge within the fort.\r\n\r\n\"We must give it them, whoever they are, whether Indians or\r\nhalf-breeds,\" he added; and immediately calling the few men who remained\r\nin the fort under arms, he and I, with four or five others, went to the\r\ngate to receive the fugitives.  They soon got up to us, and we found\r\nthat Robin was right--five of them being half-breeds, with one Chippewa\r\nIndian.\r\n\r\nThey were all panting for breath, having evidently had a long run.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they could speak, they told us that they had been out hunting\r\nbuffalo, and had already collected a large quantity of meat, with which\r\nthey intended to load their horses, when they were surprised by a body\r\nof Sioux, far outnumbering them, who had carried off their horses.\r\nBelieving that to attempt the recovery of their animals would be\r\nhopeless, they had been compelled to leave their property behind them,\r\nand make their escape from their camp, which they expected would be\r\nattacked the next morning.\r\n\r\nIt was not till daylight, they supposed, that the Sioux had discovered\r\ntheir flight.  They had already made good a considerable distance\r\nbefore, from the top of a hill they were crossing, they saw their\r\nenemies in the far distance coming after them.  They now discovered,\r\nfrom the number of those who were following, that if they wished to save\r\ntheir lives they must increase their speed, and not stop till they had\r\ngot safe into the fort.\r\n\r\nAlick bade them banish their fears, and promised to protect them.\r\n\r\nThough our garrison was greatly reduced by the absence of Sandy and the\r\nmen who had accompanied him, we lost no time in making preparations for\r\nthe expected attack.\r\n\r\nUnless the wily Indians were very numerous, they would scarcely venture,\r\nwe concluded, to assault the fort in the daytime, and would probably, on\r\ndiscovering that those they were chasing had got safe within the walls,\r\nhalt at a distance till they could form their plans.\r\n\r\nOur first care was to send out Pat with the other men to bring in the\r\nhorses and cattle feeding in the neighbourhood, which the Indians to a\r\ncertainty would otherwise have taken the liberty of lifting, as would be\r\nsaid in Scotland.\r\n\r\nThere was time to do this--at all events to save the greater number.\r\nThose at a distance would have to take care of themselves, and their\r\nsagacity would induce them to scamper off on perceiving the approach of\r\nthe Indians.\r\n\r\nWe had a well to supply us with water, and abundance of provisions, with\r\narms sufficient for six times the number of our present garrison.  These\r\nwe had loaded, and placed some in each of the four towers, and others at\r\ndifferent spots near the walls, so that one man might fire several in\r\nsuccession.  A lookout was also stationed at the top of each of the\r\ntowers, to give due notice of the approach of the enemy, as we could not\r\ntell on which side they might attack us.\r\n\r\nWe were well aware of the cunning they would exercise, and that they\r\nwould employ every trick and stratagem to take us by surprise.  Possibly\r\nthey would creep along the bank of the river during the hours of\r\ndarkness and try to scale the walls on that side, or one party might\r\ncome boldly to the fort to attract our attention, while another might be\r\nstealthily approaching from an opposite direction.  We had at all\r\nevents, we knew, to keep very wide awake.\r\n\r\nThe hunters who had been pursued, overcome with fatigue, were not likely\r\nto be of much use in keeping guard, so Alick told them to lie down and\r\nrest till they were wanted for the protection of the fort.  We anxiously\r\nlooked out for the return of Sandy and his party, and our fear was that\r\nthey might be discovered before they could reach us, and be attacked by\r\nthe Sioux.\r\n\r\nThe enemy were now seen drawing nearer and nearer, coming over the hill\r\nin the distance.  We could distinguish even the war-plumes of the chiefs\r\nwaving in the wind, and the glitter of their arms and ornaments.  They\r\nformed a large band; indeed, we knew that no Sioux, except in\r\nconsiderable numbers, would venture to cross the Cree country--feeling\r\nthemselves strong enough to fight their way back, should they be\r\nattacked, as they might expect to be, by their hereditary enemies.\r\nThere is no peace between the Sioux and the Crees.\r\n\r\nThese we knew from their plumes and war-paint to be Blackfeet, the most\r\nsavage and warlike of the northern tribes.\r\n\r\nThey approached till they reached a spot just beyond musket range.  They\r\nthere began forming a camp, so that we knew they intended regularly to\r\nbesiege the fort.  None of our little garrison, however, were in the\r\nslightest degree daunted.  We had all the requisites for standing a\r\nsiege--water, provisions, and an abundance of arms and ammunition.  A\r\nfew small field-pieces in our towers would have been of use, but it had\r\nnot been thought fit to provide the fort with them, and we had our\r\nmuskets alone to depend on, with some pikes and swords.\r\n\r\nNight now came on, and hid the enemy from view, and a short time\r\nafterwards their camp-fires blazed up, and we could see dark figures\r\nmoving about in considerable numbers.  Still, Alick suspected that they\r\nmight have dispatched a party to come round and try to surprise us on\r\nthe opposite side.  When Robin heard this he offered to go out and watch\r\nthe camp, so that he might track any body of men who might have set out\r\nwith this purpose in view.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot let you do that,\" answered Alick.  \"You may know the Indian\r\nways very well, but were you to be caught they would to a certainty kill\r\nyou, and we can spare no one from the fort at present.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I will, if you'll allow me, try to find Sandy, and warn him that\r\nthe Sioux are in the neighbourhood,\" said Robin.  \"I want to prove to\r\nyou how grateful I am for all the kindness you have shown me.  I might\r\nbe the means of saving Sandy from falling into the hands of the enemy.\"\r\n\r\nAlick did not answer immediately.\r\n\r\n\"Your proposal to warn Sandy is an important one,\" he said at length;\r\n\"still I am very unwilling to accede to it.  You would run a very great\r\nrisk of being tracked and discovered by the Sioux, and I should never\r\nforgive myself if any harm were to happen to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me go then,\" I said; \"I would rather run the risk than expose Robin\r\nto it.  As I am older and stronger, and know the country better than he\r\ndoes, there will be less danger of my being caught.\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot agree that you know the country better than I do,\" said Robin.\r\n\"During the different excursions we have made I noted every leading\r\nobject we passed, in the mode I learned to do while I was with the\r\nIndians; and though I do not wish to disparage your knowledge, I suspect\r\nthat I could with more certainty find my way on a dark night than you\r\ncould.\"\r\n\r\nI could not help acknowledging that Robin was right, for I had often\r\nremarked how perfectly he knew every spot he had but once passed, and\r\nthat often he could find his way when the rest of us were in doubts\r\nabout the matter.\r\n\r\nAlick was so convinced of the importance of warning Sandy that an enemy\r\nwas near at hand, that he at last consented to allow Robin to set out on\r\nhis proposed hazardous expedition.  No one in the fort was so likely to\r\nsucceed as he was.  Martin did not know the country as well, and Pat\r\nwould probably have made some mistake, and been caught by the enemy.\r\nThe rest of the men were more accustomed to the river, or to conduct the\r\nsleighs or beasts of burden between the different posts.  Robin having\r\ntaken a good supper, and examined his gun and ammunition, declared\r\nhimself ready to start.  The night was dark, and unless any of the Sioux\r\nshould have crept up to the fort for the purpose of watching us, he was\r\nnot likely to be discovered on leaving it.  Alick, Martin, and I\r\naccompanied him to the gate, and each of us warmly wrung his hand.\r\n\r\n\"May Heaven protect you,\" said Alick.  \"Be cautious, my boy, and don't\r\nrun any unnecessary risk.\"\r\n\r\nWe concealed our lanterns, lest the enemy might perceive the light as\r\nthe gate was opened, and suspect that some one was leaving the fort.  We\r\nstood for some moments watching our young friend till he disappeared in\r\nthe darkness, when the gate was again carefully closed.\r\n\r\nI believed that Alick half repented allowing him to go now he had set\r\nout, for he had endeared himself to us all, and we felt how deeply we\r\nshould grieve should any harm happen to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SIX.\r\n\r\nEXTREME VIGILANCE IN THE FORT--FIRE!--THE CHARGE OF THE BLACKFEET--THEIR\r\nTERRIFIC WAR-WHOOP--THE BLACKFEET RETIRE--THE SECOND ATTACK--\"DOWN WITH\r\nTHE SPALPEENS\"--A FRIENDLY WAR-WHOOP HEARD JUST AS AFFAIRS HAVE BECOME\r\nDESPERATE--THE BLACKFEET RETREAT--OUR INDIAN ALLIES ENJOY A\r\nSCALP-DANCE--HAVING EATEN ALL OUR PROVISIONS, THEY INVITE US TO\r\nACCOMPANY THEM ON A HUNTING EXPEDITION--ROBIN'S BADGER--THE BUFFALO\r\nHUNT--THE HERD OF MOOSE--WATCHFULNESS OF THE MOOSE--THE \"SUNJEGWUN\"--THE\r\nCREE CHIEF'S WARNING--WE START FOR THE FORT.\r\n\r\nThere was to be no sleep for us that night.  Alick and I were\r\ncontinually going our rounds, to see that all the men were on the alert.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Robin had set out I went to the tower nearest to the gate,\r\nand watched anxiously for any sign which would show that he had been\r\ndiscovered by the Sioux.  I stayed as long as I could venture to do, but\r\nall remained perfectly quiet in the direction I supposed he had taken.\r\nSo far this was satisfactory; I knew how well acquainted he was with the\r\nways of the Indians, and that he was not likely to be surprised.  His\r\near would be quick to detect the sound of their approach; his keen eye\r\nwould be able to pierce far through the gloom of night.  Should any\r\nparties, therefore, be moving about, I trusted that he would manage to\r\navoid them.\r\n\r\nMidnight came at last, and so tranquil did all remain around that, had\r\nwe not seen the Indian camp-fires blazing up in the distance, we should\r\nnot have supposed that the enemy was near us.\r\n\r\nOur guests were still asleep with their arms by their sides, ready for\r\ninstant use.  For one thing I was glad that Rose and Letty were safe at\r\nFort Ross, though I had no doubt that they would have behaved as\r\ncourageously as any girls under the circumstances could have done, and\r\nif they had not fired the muskets, would have helped to load them, and\r\nwould have tended any who were wounded.\r\n\r\nWe showed no lights from the fort, which might have let the Indians know\r\nthat we were on the watch.  We spoke also in low voices, that, should\r\nany of them be skulking round the fort, they might not hear us.\r\n\r\nIt was about two hours past midnight; though I confess that I was\r\nbeginning to get somewhat tired, neither Alick nor I had relaxed in our\r\nvigilance.  Martin was also doing his part in watching from the tower at\r\nthe south-west angle.\r\n\r\nIt was agreed that even should we see the Indians approaching we should\r\ngive no sign that we were awake, so that our fire, when once we opened\r\nit, might have greater effect.  If one side only was attacked, the whole\r\ngarrison was to go over to defend it, leaving only a single man at the\r\nother angles to watch lest another party might assault it on that side.\r\n\r\nI had just gone into the tower where Martin was keeping watch, when,\r\nturning round as he heard me enter, he whispered, \"They are coming!\" and\r\nhe drew me to a loophole.  I looked through, and could distinguish a\r\nmass of dark forms just issuing from the gloom, crouching low down, and\r\ntrailing their arms so as to escape observation.  Having satisfied\r\nmyself that they were really our enemies coming on to attack the fort, I\r\nhurried down to tell Alick, and to summon the men for the defence of the\r\nside on which I supposed the assault would be made.\r\n\r\n\"Remember, lads,\" said Alick, \"don't fire a shot till I tell you, and\r\nthe moment you have fired get another musket ready for a second\r\ndischarge.\"\r\n\r\nThe men sprang to their posts at the loopholes, some going to the upper\r\npart of the tower, and some to the lower story.  We were all at our\r\nposts, when suddenly a most terrific war-whoop burst upon our ears.  I\r\nnever heard so awful a noise, though I had fancied I knew what it was\r\nlike.  So fearful is the sound of the Indian war-whoop that even the\r\nmost savage beasts have often been frightened out of their wits.\r\nBuffaloes have, it is said, been known to fall down on their knees,\r\nunable either to run or make any resistance; and the bear has been so\r\nterror-stricken as to quit his hold, and fall from the tree in utter\r\namazement and helplessness.\r\n\r\nAgain that fearful war-whoop arose, piercing our very brains; though\r\nneither Martin nor I had ever heard it before it did not intimidate us,\r\nnor did it the rest of the garrison.\r\n\r\nWe waited, as ordered, till we heard Alick shout \"Fire!\" when each man\r\ndischarged his musket, and immediately, as directed, grasped another.\r\n\r\nThe Indians, supposing that some time would elapse before we had\r\nreloaded; sprang forward; but ere they could reach the walls another\r\nvolley laid many of them low, and we were prepared to pour in a third\r\nupon them before they had again moved forward.\r\n\r\nThe shrieks and cries of the wounded rang through the air, for they were\r\nso completely taken by surprise that for the time they forgot their\r\nusual stoicism, and gave way to the impulse of human nature to cry out\r\nwith pain.\r\n\r\n\"Reload!\" cried Alick, who had watched all their movements.  \"Fire the\r\nmoment one of them advances.\"  Instead of approaching nearer, however,\r\nthe whole band drew back, when several muskets were discharged from\r\namong them--the bullets being accompanied by a cloud of arrows; but\r\nstriking the palisades or flying over our heads, they did no harm.\r\n\r\n\"Those are the very arms we sold to the Indian the other day, I\r\nsuspect,\" observed Martin.  \"Sandy at the time said he was sure Mr Pipe\r\nhad some sinister object in view.  He has managed to hand them over to\r\nthese rascals.\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as the Indians began to fire, Alick ordered us to fire in\r\nreturn, he himself setting the example.  As we had managed to reload all\r\nthe pieces we had already fired, and had several others still unused,\r\nour bullets produced a fearful effect among the Indians, who retreated\r\nfarther and farther from the fort, till darkness hid them from view.\r\n\r\nWe sent another volley after them, when Alick ordered us to cease\r\nfiring, hoping that the enemy would not again venture to approach.\r\n\r\nImmediately silence reigned throughout the fort.  Not a shout was\r\nraised, not a word above a whisper uttered, except when Alick in a stern\r\nvoice exclaimed, \"Fire!\"\r\n\r\nThe Indians had discovered that they could have no hope of taking us by\r\nsurprise; but, at the same time, we knew that they might again venture\r\nto attack the fort, and that we must keep as much on the alert as\r\nbefore.  We felt confident that as long as they should assault the fort\r\nin the same manner as at first we could drive them back, but should they\r\nchange their tactics the case might be different.\r\n\r\nIf the chiefs could restore the courage of their followers, they might\r\ncompletely surround the fort; and should they venture to climb over the\r\npalisades on all sides at once, we might have great difficulty in\r\ndriving them back.\r\n\r\nSuspecting that they might make an attempt to get in in the way I have\r\nlast mentioned, Alick sent men to each of the other angles to be ready\r\nshould the Indians appear.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the night went by.  It was one of the most anxious\r\ntimes I ever passed in my life.  When morning dawned the Indians could\r\nbe seen in the far distance in as great numbers as before, but none of\r\ntheir bands were visible near the fort.  We had little fear of their\r\nrenewing the attack during the daytime, and Alick gave orders to all the\r\ngarrison, except a few men at a time required to keep watch, to lie down\r\nand get some sleep.  He directed me to do the same, promising to summon\r\nme when he required to be relieved.\r\n\r\nAfter I had rested about three hours he called me up, and I was very\r\nglad to get some breakfast before going on watch.  I spent all the\r\nmorning in one of the towers, keeping a constant lookout on the enemy,\r\nwho seemed in no way inclined to move, while I frequently turned an\r\nanxious eye in other directions, hoping to see Robin with Sandy and his\r\ncompanions returning to the fort.\r\n\r\nIn vain, however, I looked.  No human being could I distinguish, either\r\non the more open prairie or among the trees in the distance.  The day\r\ndrew on; perhaps, if our friends had discovered the vicinity of the\r\nIndians, they might wait under cover till dark, but if they had not seen\r\nthem they would make at once for the fort.  Still they did not come, and\r\ndarkness closed in upon us.  We had another night before us of anxiety\r\nand watchfulness.  The same arrangements were made as on the previous\r\nnight, and Alick and I, assisted by Martin, were continually making the\r\nround of the fort.  At any moment we might have the whole horde of\r\nsavages upon us; yet, in the meantime, we could do nothing to defend\r\nourselves, except to keep our muskets loaded and ready for action.  Even\r\nthough we could tell the direction in which the Indians had retreated,\r\nthere was no use in firing into the empty air.\r\n\r\nThe silence we maintained would, however, we knew, have greater effect\r\non our enemies than the loudest shouts we could have raised.\r\n\r\n\"I wish they would come on,\" exclaimed Martin; \"the fellows, after all,\r\nare but arrant cowards.  They make noise enough when they fancy that\r\nthey are going to have things all their own way.  I suspect they are far\r\nenough off by this time.\"\r\n\r\n\"We must not depend too much upon that,\" I observed.  \"If they think\r\nthat they can surprise us they will try again.  Perhaps they fancy that\r\nwe suppose we have driven them away, and will turn in and go to sleep,\r\nand they are waiting till our eyes are fast closed.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wonder what o'clock it is,\" said Martin.\r\n\r\n\"Not many minutes to dawn,\" I answered.  \"We shall ere long see the\r\nlight breaking in the eastern sky.\"\r\n\r\nScarcely had I uttered the words when Martin, who had gone back to his\r\nloophole, whispered, \"There they are again, but coming on very\r\ndifferently to the first time.\"\r\n\r\nI looked out, and could see a dark line extending round the whole front\r\nand side of the fort.  I hurried down to Alick, warning the men in a low\r\nvoice to be on the alert.  We went over to the opposite side.  From this\r\nalso we saw the same dark line slowly approaching nearer and nearer.\r\n\r\nIt was very evident that the Indians had surrounded the fort, and\r\nintended to attack us simultaneously on every side.  Alick immediately\r\ndistributed the men in equal parties round the stockade, and directed\r\nthem as before to await his order to fire.  The war-whoop the enemy had\r\nbefore uttered was terrific enough.  Suddenly the air was rent by the\r\nloudest and most fearful shrieks rising from every side of us, and the\r\nnext instant showers of arrows, and a few bullets, came whistling above\r\nour heads, and directly afterwards the Indians appeared emerging from\r\nthe gloom.\r\n\r\nAlick waited till they were near enough for every bullet to take effect.\r\nMost of our men were tolerable shots, but the Indians, instead of\r\nrushing straight forward, kept leaping from side to side, and thus many\r\nescaped.  Though we had our second muskets in readiness, urged on by\r\ntheir former failure, they sprang forward at so rapid a rate that before\r\nwe could fire a large number had reached the walls, against which they\r\nplaced long pieces of light timber, with notches in them to serve as\r\nladders.  The most active of our people were engaged in throwing these\r\ndown as fast as they were placed against the palisades, while the rest\r\nby Alick's orders kept firing rapidly away, taking up musket after\r\nmusket.\r\n\r\nActive as we were, several of the enemy climbed to the top of the\r\npalisades, but were hurled backwards, or, being shot as they appeared,\r\nfell down into the fort.  In spite of the fate which had overtaken their\r\ncomrades, others made most daring attempts to get in.  Should two or\r\nthree succeed, they, with their tomahawks, might keep a space clear for\r\na sufficient time to enable others to follow them, and the fort might be\r\ntaken.  Now they made a desperate assault on one side, now on another,\r\nbut were each time repulsed.  We had the advantage of possessing a\r\nplatform on which we could run rapidly from place to place as we were\r\nrequired, while the enemy had the ditch to pass and the high palisade to\r\nclimb before they could reach the top.  This enabled us to defend\r\nourselves in a way we could not otherwise have done; still the Indians\r\nvastly outnumbered us, and seemed determined not to abandon their\r\nenterprise.  Several of our men had been wounded, but not severely,\r\nwhile numbers of the enemy had fallen.\r\n\r\nPat Casey was among the most active of the garrison--now firing his\r\nmusket, now pronging at an Indian who had climbed to the top of the\r\npalisade, now using a broadsword which he had secured to his side, all\r\nthe time shouting out, \"Erin go bragh!  Down with the spalpeens.  Arrah!\r\nnow you're coming in, are you?  Just take that thin, and find out that\r\nyou've made a mistake.\"\r\n\r\nThe last sentence he uttered as he ran an Indian through the shoulder\r\nand hurled him back into the ditch.\r\n\r\nEach man of our party knew that he was fighting for his life.  No mercy\r\ncould be expected should the fort be taken; still, in spite of the\r\ncourage and activity displayed by our people, there seemed too much\r\nprobability that the enemy would succeed.  It was not thought likely\r\nthat they would attack the towers, but Alick considered it necessary to\r\nkeep a man in each, who was ordered to fire away, while he watched to\r\ngive notice should the enemy attempt to attack that part of the fort.\r\n\r\nThe darkness prevented us from observing the movements of the Indians,\r\nbut I fancied as I was looking out that I saw a considerable number\r\nretreating, and I could hear no voices coming from that side; still the\r\nrest continued the attack, though perhaps with less energy than before.\r\n\r\nSome time elapsed without any effort being made to climb up the\r\npalisades.  Flights of arrows were continually shot at us, and our ears\r\nwere assailed with the most fearful shouts and shrieks.  Presently, as I\r\nwas looking out on the west side, I saw a dense mass appear out of the\r\ngloom, and to my dismay I discovered that it was composed of men\r\ncarrying large fagots.\r\n\r\nI told Alick what I had seen, and he immediately summoned six of our\r\nbest men to that side of the fort, for its defence.\r\n\r\nIt was clearly the intention of our enemies to throw the fagots down\r\nagainst the walls, so as to fill up the ditch and form a path up which\r\nthey could climb, or to set them on fire and burn down the stockades.\r\nAlick, supported by Pat with half a dozen men, stood ready to receive\r\nthem; while others in the towers, which enfiladed the walls, kept up a\r\nhot fire which struck down several of the Indians as they rushed up to\r\nplace their fagots.\r\n\r\nIt being necessary, of course, to defend the walls on the other side,\r\nMartin and I were hurrying here and there as we saw the enemy\r\napproaching.\r\n\r\n\"Here they come,\" I heard Alick shout out.\r\n\r\nAt the same moment a terrific war-whoop sounded in our ears.\r\n\r\n\"Fire steadily at them, my lads,\" cried Alick; \"and if they get within\r\nreach of our bayonets, let them feel the points.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shure! that's what we'll be afther doing,\" cried Pat.--\"Won't we, boys?\r\nErin go bragh!\" and a well-directed volley drove back the first body of\r\nIndians who were attempting to mount.  They had been sent apparently as\r\na forlorn hope, for the next instant another party still more numerous\r\nappeared, while, as I hurried over to the other side, I saw a third\r\nband, advancing evidently with the intention of making a separate\r\nattack.\r\n\r\nAt the same instant the entire body of our enemies, uniting their\r\nvoices, uttered another of those dreadful war-whoops.  Though we had\r\nhitherto kept up our courage, but few among us believed that we should\r\nbe able to offer an effectual resistance.  The next instant, however,\r\nere the shrieks of our enemies had died away, they were answered by\r\nother cries which came from the forest.  Could a fresh body of Indians\r\nbe about to attack us?  Should such be the case our doom was sealed.\r\n\r\nSuch were the thoughts that passed through my mind.\r\n\r\nAgain that war-whoop sounded through the night air.  \"Hurrah!\" cried\r\nPat, \"those are friendly Indians.  I know it by the sound.\"\r\n\r\nPat's assertion was corroborated by several of the other men.  Our\r\nwell-nigh exhausted strength and courage were restored.\r\n\r\nThe Indians had heard these cries, and the formidable party which had\r\nbeen mounting the fagots hurried back, while the last who had been seen\r\napproaching retreated.  We plied them more rapidly than ever with our\r\nmusketry.  We could hear their chiefs issuing their orders, and in\r\nanother minute the whole line scampered off and disappeared in the\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\nNot many minutes afterwards we heard Sandy's voice shouting out, \"We\r\nhave brought some Indian friends to your assistance.\"\r\n\r\nWe now, without hesitation, threw open the gate, and the next instant\r\nRobin sprang forward and shook our hands, while Sandy with his six men\r\nappeared directly afterwards.\r\n\r\n\"No time to stop,\" exclaimed Sandy.  \"The youngster found us, and we\r\nfell in with some friends in time of need, who agreed to come along with\r\nus.  There they are; but they're afraid to come near, lest you should\r\nmistake them for the foe, and pepper them.  They and we must be after\r\nthe rascals who have been attacking you.  Can't stop to ask questions;\r\nonly hope you are all safe.  Keep Robin fast, or he'll be running after\r\nus, and there is no need to let the lad run his nose into unnecessary\r\ndanger.  I hope you are all right, though?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, thank you; none of us hurt badly,\" answered Alick.\r\n\r\n\"That's well,\" exclaimed Sandy; and without more ado he and his men\r\nhurried after the Indians, who were already cautiously moving on in the\r\ndirection our late assailants had taken.\r\n\r\n\"Don't pursue them too far, or you may fall in with fresh bands, and may\r\nhave a hard matter to fight your way back,\" shouted Alick.\r\n\r\n\"Ay, ay!\" answered Sandy; \"trust me and the Indians for that,\" and he\r\nand his men were soon lost to sight in the gloom.\r\n\r\nSeveral of our men eagerly begged for leave to go out and join Sandy's\r\nparty.  Alick would, however, only allow six of them, including three of\r\nthe hunters to whom we had given refuge, to go.  All being well armed,\r\nwe had no doubt that they would drive back the Sioux, and probably kill\r\nor capture a number of them.\r\n\r\nRobin, as Sandy had supposed he would, wanted to go also; but Martin and\r\nI held him fast till the gate was closed.\r\n\r\n\"Now go and lie down, my boy,\" said Alick.  \"You have been on your legs\r\na good many hours, and have done us service enough for one day, or for\r\nmany days for that matter.\"\r\n\r\nRobin somewhat unwillingly obeyed, having first taken some food, of\r\nwhich he stood in need; and as he dropped off to sleep immediately, it\r\nwas evident that he was pretty well worn out.\r\n\r\nWe had now to wait for the return of our friends.  In the meantime we\r\ndid our best to dress the hurts of the men who had been wounded.  In\r\nmany cases they could help each other, in their own rough fashion, for\r\nthey were generally in so healthy a state that injuries which might have\r\nproved fatal to people living what is called a civilised life, compelled\r\nthem scarcely to lay up for more than a day or two.\r\n\r\nThree of our guests had been wounded, but they made light of the matter,\r\nand declared that they should at once be able to proceed on their\r\njourney.\r\n\r\nMartin and I amused ourselves by collecting all the arrows which had\r\nbeen shot into the fort, and a fine number we had of them.  We agreed to\r\nornament the walls of one of the rooms with the arrows, and to send\r\nothers to our friends.  We could not find the bullets which had been\r\nfired, and concluded that they had all been shot over the fort, and\r\noften into the ground on the opposite side, perhaps killing our foes\r\ninstead of us.\r\n\r\nConsidering the vast number of the enemy, and the desperate courage they\r\nhad displayed in attacking the fort, we had great reason to be thankful\r\nthat we had been preserved.  I believe, indeed, that we ought to be\r\nthankful every day of our existence, for we know not how many unseen\r\ndangers we escape in our walk through life.  I know that I did not think\r\nso seriously of such matters as I do now; but I am sure that the earlier\r\nwe begin to think of God's protecting providence, the more anxious we\r\nshall be to serve Him, and to refrain from offending One so kind and\r\nmerciful.\r\n\r\nAnother day broke, but still neither Sandy's party nor his Indian allies\r\nhad reappeared, and Alick began to fear that they had followed the enemy\r\nfurther than was prudent.  Should the Sioux have turned upon them with\r\nthe same bravery they had displayed when attacking the fort, our friends\r\nwould have run a fearful risk of being cut off, while we should probably\r\nbe again attacked with less prospect than before of success.\r\n\r\nThough pretty well tired with our long watching and our desperate\r\nexertions in defence of the fort, we were in good spirits.  Alick\r\nhowever who was prudent, had the arms reloaded, and made as much\r\npreparation for defence as he considered necessary.\r\n\r\nThe Sioux, I should have said, when retreating, had carried off their\r\ndead and wounded, to save them from the ignominy of being scalped, which\r\nwould to a certainty have been their fate had our Indian allies found\r\nthem on the ground.  We were thus saved the horror of witnessing the\r\nspectacle, as also the trouble of burying the dead.  The Indians would\r\nprobably also have killed all the wounded, in spite of the efforts we\r\nshould have made to save them.\r\n\r\nAt length, about noon the watchman in the tower shouted out that he saw\r\na party approaching from the south-west--the direction the Sioux had\r\nprobably taken.  We were for some time in doubt whether they were\r\nfriends or foes.  At length Martin, who was on the lookout with me,\r\nexclaimed: \"Hurrah!  I'm sure that's old Sandy marching ahead, with an\r\nIndian chief by his side; and there come the men.  They have thrashed\r\nthe Sioux--no doubt about that--and it will be a long time before the\r\nrascals venture to pay us another visit.\"\r\n\r\nI was not quite certain that Martin was right, and feared that his\r\nimagination had deceived him.  While we were discussing the matter, we\r\nwere joined by Robin, whose eyes were sharper than either of ours.  He\r\nhad at once declared that Martin was not mistaken.  We accordingly\r\nannounced the fact to Alick and the few men who were awake.  The\r\nsleepers were quickly roused by the shout of satisfaction which was\r\nuttered, and there being no longer any apprehension of danger, we\r\nhurried out to meet our friends, accompanied by Bouncer and a whole\r\ntribe of smaller dogs, which lived under his rule.\r\n\r\n\"We've given the Sioux a lesson they'll not forget in a hurry,\"\r\nexclaimed Sandy, as we met.  \"We came upon them while they were\r\nencamped, not dreaming that we were near, and before they could stand to\r\ntheir arms we had shot down a dozen or more, including all the fellows\r\nwho had muskets, which the others in their fright, as they jumped up to\r\nfly, left behind them.  We took possession of the muskets, and followed\r\nup the enemy for an hour or more.  How many were killed it would have\r\nbeen hard to say, as we did not stop to count those we shot down; but\r\nour redskin friends have got thirty scalps, which would be about the\r\ntally, as they looked out for all who fell.  I don't approve of the\r\ncustom, for they are not very particular in seeing whether a man's alive\r\nor dead before they lift the hair from the crown of his head.\"\r\n\r\nAlick would gladly have prevented the slaughter which had occurred.  It\r\nstruck us that probably the Sioux in their flight had thrown down the\r\nmen who had been killed or wounded in the attack on the fort, and that\r\nthese were included in the number Sandy spoke of.\r\n\r\nOur Indian allies, after enjoying a scalp-dance outside the fort--not a\r\nvery edifying spectacle, but an amusement in which they seemed to take\r\nan especial delight--were invited to partake of a feast which had been\r\nin the meantime preparing.  All our cooks had been engaged on it, and\r\nthough not of a very refined description, it suited the taste of our\r\nguests.\r\n\r\nWe had buffalo meat and venison, boiled, roasted, and stewed, with flour\r\ncakes, and potatoes the produce of our garden.  A small amount of whisky\r\nwas served out; but Alick was careful not to give the Indians enough to\r\nmake them lose their wits.  The chiefs, however, who asked for more, got\r\nsufficient to make them loquacious, and some wonderfully long speeches\r\nwere uttered, expressing the affection they felt for us, their pale-face\r\nbrothers.\r\n\r\nWhen night came on they encamped outside, as it was a rule never to\r\nallow any large body of Indians, whoever they were, to sleep inside the\r\nfort.  As they were aware of this, they were not offended.  The weather\r\nbeing warm they had no great hardship to endure, though unable to put up\r\nwigwams for their protection.  Before lying down they had another\r\nscalp-dance, which they kept up to a late hour.\r\n\r\nWe were in hopes that they would go the next day, but they showed no\r\ninclination to move as long as they could obtain an abundant supply of\r\nfood.  We, of course, were obliged to serve it out from our stores, and\r\nshould have been considered very ungrateful had we given them a hint to\r\ntake their departure.  They thus consumed nearly the whole of the\r\nsubstantial provisions we had in the fort, including flour and potatoes;\r\nand not till Alick told them that we had but little more to offer did\r\nthey express an intention of going away.\r\n\r\nBefore doing so they invited us to accompany them on a hunting\r\nexpedition, which they proposed making in a few days, after they had\r\nreturned to their own lodges and obtained horses for the purpose.\r\nMartin and I were eager to go, as was Robin; and we persuaded Alick to\r\naccompany us, as he required a change after the arduous work he had gone\r\nthrough.  At first he was very doubtful about the matter; but he\r\nconsented at length to leave Sandy in charge, which he often had done\r\nwhen compelled to be absent from the fort.\r\n\r\nWe started from home with our guns, intending to shoot on the way,\r\ndirecting our horses to be brought after us.  We were accompanied by\r\nBouncer, who was always our attendant on such occasions; and very useful\r\nhe often made himself, being expert in attacking all animals, but\r\nespecially cautious when he met with those with whose prowess he was\r\nwell acquainted.  We had bagged two or three small animals and a few\r\nbirds, when, forgetting our usual custom of keeping together, we each\r\ntook a different path, which led us to some distance apart.  Martin was\r\nnearest to me; I could still see him between the trees, when I heard a\r\nshot.  I looked towards him; but as I saw no smoke, I concluded that he\r\nhad not fired.  Directly afterwards he shouted, \"Come on, David!  I\r\nheard Robin cry out; something must have happened.\"\r\n\r\nI ran as fast as I could, shouting to Alick, who I hoped might hear me.\r\nThe ground being tolerably open in the direction I had taken, I quickly\r\novertook Martin.\r\n\r\n\"It was there I heard his voice,\" he exclaimed.  \"Yes; he's still crying\r\nout.  I can't understand it, but I hope nothing terrible has happened to\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\nGuided by Robin's voice, we at last got near him.  At the same moment\r\nAlick appeared in another direction between the trees.\r\n\r\nInstead of being alarmed, we burst into a fit of laughter, for there was\r\nRobin holding on to the bushy tail of an animal which with might and\r\nmain was making towards a hole near at hand.  \"Help me! help me!\" cried\r\nRobin, \"or the beast will get away.\"\r\n\r\nRobin pulled in one direction, and the beast, which I saw was an\r\nunusually large badger, was endeavouring to scramble off in another,\r\ndragging Robin after it.  Before Bouncer, who had followed Alick, could\r\nspring forward to Robin's assistance the badger had reached its hole,\r\ndown which it was struggling with might and main to descend; but Robin,\r\nwho had now no fears of being bitten, held on stoutly, while Bouncer\r\nflew at the hinder quarters of the beast, of which he took a firm grip.\r\n\r\n\"Pull away, Robin, pull away,\" I shouted.  \"You can have the honour of\r\nkilling him yourself, with the help of Bouncer.\"\r\n\r\nRobin hauled away, and so did the dog; but for some time it seemed\r\ndoubtful which party would gain the victory.  At last Robin, by a\r\ndesperate effort, hauled the unfortunate badger out of the hole; and as\r\nhe did so he fell backwards, still holding on, and drawing the creature\r\nalmost over him.  On this Bouncer seized it by the neck, and Martin,\r\ntaking up a thick stick which lay at hand, stunned it with a blow, when\r\nit was quickly dispatched.  We took off the skin, as we had those of the\r\nother animals we had shot, and did them up to be sent back by the men\r\nwho brought our horses.\r\n\r\nI mention the circumstance as it afforded us much amusement; and though\r\nit will not appear a very important one, it showed Robin's determination\r\nnot to be defeated in anything he undertook.  After that we used\r\nfrequently to observe, \"Stick to it as Robin did to the badger's tail,\r\nand you'll get it out of the hole at last.\"\r\n\r\nIt is what I would advise others to do when they have difficulties to\r\ncontend with, whether great or small.\r\n\r\nThe horses overtook us in the afternoon, when we rode on and camped by\r\nourselves for the night, intending to join our Indian friends the next\r\nday.  We had brought with us a small supply of provisions, in addition\r\nto the game which we had shot on our way, expecting that the Indians\r\nwould be able to furnish us with buffalo meat, on which we had no\r\nobjection to live for a few days.\r\n\r\nNext morning, having breakfasted and caught our horses, we rode on; but\r\nit was not till nearly evening that we reached the Cree camp.  We slept\r\nin a skin-covered wigwam which they appropriated to our use, and the\r\nfollowing morning started for the southward in search of buffalo, which\r\nwere supposed to be in considerable numbers in that direction.  We rode\r\non all day, stopping only to take a meal about noon, but not a buffalo\r\ndid we see.  We had exhausted all our provisions, and regretted that we\r\nhad not brought more with us for our own private use.\r\n\r\nSmall fires only were formed, around which we lay down to sleep.  It was\r\nnearly dawn when the Cree chief, touching my arm, awoke me.\r\n\r\n\"Listen!\" he said, putting his head close down to the ground.\r\n\r\nI did so, and could hear a low, dull sound, as if numberless feet were\r\nbeating the soil.\r\n\r\n\"That is the tramp of buffaloes,\" he observed.\r\n\r\nWhen, however, I sat up I could hear nothing.  The chief told me to call\r\nmy brother and other friends, and proposed, as soon as we had had\r\nsomething to eat, that we should set off in the direction from whence\r\nthe sounds we had heard proceeded.\r\n\r\nI roused up my companions, and when they put their ears down to the\r\nground and listened, they also could hear the same tramping sound.\r\n\r\nI was not yet perfectly convinced that the chief was right, but he\r\nasserted that there was no mistake about the matter.\r\n\r\nWhen we told the chief that we had no food, he looked rather blank, and\r\nshortly returned with some dried venison, which we were fain to cook as\r\nbest we could before the fire.  We had a small supply of biscuit, and a\r\nstream at hand furnished us with water.  Thus fortified, we mounted our\r\nhorses and rode to the top of a hill near at hand, from which we could\r\ncommand an extensive view of the prairie.\r\n\r\nNot a sign, however, of a buffalo could be seen; still the chief was\r\nconfident that he was not mistaken, and we pushed our horses in the\r\ndirection of the sounds we had heard for at least ten miles.  When we\r\nhad gone about another ten miles we could just distinguish a black line\r\ncrossing the prairie.\r\n\r\n\"I told you so,\" said the chief; \"there they are, and we shall in less\r\nthan another hour be up to them.\"\r\n\r\nAll we could as yet see was the mere margin of the herd, looking, as I\r\nhave said, like a black line thrown along the edge of the sky, or a low\r\nshore just visible across a lake.\r\n\r\nWe calculated that the place where we first heard the sounds of the\r\nanimals' feet could not have been less than twenty miles off.  As we\r\ndrew near we observed that the herd was in the wildest state of\r\ncommotion.  The bulls every now and then rushing at each other and\r\nfighting desperately, the sounds produced by the knocking together of\r\ntheir hoofs as they raised their feet from the ground, their incessant\r\ntramping and loud and furious roars as they engaged in their terrific\r\nconflicts, created an uproar which it seemed surprising our horses took\r\nso quietly; but we had chosen animals well accustomed to hunting the\r\nbuffalo, and they were as eager as we were for the chase.  Under other\r\ncircumstances it would have required great caution to approach the herd;\r\nbut engaged as they now were they were not easily alarmed, and the Cree\r\nchief giving the word we rode directly at them.\r\n\r\n\"Let the bulls alone,\" cried the chief, as we galloped forward.  \"Single\r\nout the cows; they alone are worth eating.  Don't stop to ram down your\r\ncharges after you have fired, but pour in the powder, and drop down the\r\nbullet upon it.  'Twill serve your purpose, for you must not draw\r\ntrigger till you're close to the animal, or you will fail to bring it to\r\nthe ground.\"\r\n\r\nWe, of course, promised to follow his instructions, and dashed forward.\r\nAs we got nearer we saw that the herd was so densely packed that we\r\nshould have the greatest difficulty in making our way into their midst\r\nwithout having our horses injured by their horns; not that the buffaloes\r\nwould have run at them, but in consequence of the rapid way in which\r\nthey moved them about, in their frantic rage, in all directions.  We\r\ntherefore galloped along in front of the herd with the intention of\r\ngetting on their flanks, or finding some opening through which we might\r\nreach the cows.\r\n\r\nAt last the chief proposed that we should dismount, and, leaving the\r\nhorses under the care of some of the men, try to make our way in on\r\nfoot.  I thought this a very hazardous experiment, and made some remark\r\nto that effect.\r\n\r\n\"Not so hazardous as you may suppose,\" answered the chief.  \"The animals\r\nwill not see you, and you have only to leap out of their way should any\r\ncome rushing in the direction where you are standing.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have often shot buffalo in that way,\" exclaimed Robin.  \"Keep with\r\nme, David, and we'll see what we can do.\"\r\n\r\nI preferred trusting him to the chief, whom Alick and Martin followed.\r\n\r\nRobin and I were soon in the midst of the surging sea of horns.  His\r\nboldness gave me courage; but it was necessary to keep our eyes round us\r\non all sides, and to be ready to leap here and there, to get out of the\r\nway of the animals, which were constantly on the move.  The part we had\r\nentered was of course far more open than that where we first made the\r\nattempt.\r\n\r\nRobin's coolness was wonderful.  He was the first to shoot a cow.\r\n\r\n\"Let it alone,\" he said; \"I see some more out there.\"\r\n\r\nAs we made our way onwards and were trying to get at the cows, a whole\r\nmass of the bulls came surging around us, and presently several, putting\r\ntheir heads to the ground, dashed forward, directly towards the place\r\nwhere we were standing.\r\n\r\n\"Here! here!\" cried Robin; \"we shall be safe,\" and he pointed to a deep\r\nhollow which in the rainy season had held water, but was now perfectly\r\ndry.\r\n\r\nWe both leaped in; when the bulls came rushing by us but again stopped,\r\nand others joining them, the whole began to fight with the greatest\r\ndesperation.  The only chance we had of getting out of our disagreeable\r\nposition was to kill the bulls and make our way through them.  We fired\r\nand loaded as fast as we could, and seven lay stretched on the ground.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" cried Robin, \"is our time to escape.\"\r\n\r\nWe sprang up and dashed through the herd; but greatly to our\r\ndisappointment, when we looked out for the cows, we found that our\r\nfiring had alarmed them, and that they had all run off.  Not quite\r\nliking this sort of work, we regained our horses and galloped on to\r\nwhere we saw a party of our Indian friends, who had just killed a cow.\r\n\r\nMost of the herd had moved away from the spot; but one enormous bull on\r\nseeing what had happened, bellowing furiously, came dashing towards us,\r\nploughing up the ground with his horns.  The Indians, unwilling to stand\r\nhis charge, turned and fled; when the animal seeing me rushed forward,\r\ndetermined, it seemed, to wreak his vengeance on my steed.\r\n\r\nMy well-trained animal, however, bounded out of the way, when I, having\r\nmy gun loaded, fired at the bull, which was not three yards from me.\r\nThe ball penetrating his chest, he fell dead.  The Indians now returned,\r\nand began cutting up the cow.  While they were so engaged, another cow,\r\nwhich they supposed to be the mother of the one they had killed,\r\ngalloped towards us, bellowing loudly.  They, not having their arms in\r\ntheir hands, took to flight, declaring that the cow was resolved on\r\nrevenging herself for the slaughter of her daughter.\r\n\r\nI was much inclined to follow them; but Robin asking me to hold the\r\nhorse, slipped from the saddle, and throwing himself by the body of the\r\ndead cow, rested his rifle so that he could take steady aim, and as the\r\nraging cow came near he fired.  She turned, gave one or two jumps, and\r\nfell dead.\r\n\r\nWe had now an ample supply of meat.  Several other cows had been killed,\r\nand the Indians employed themselves in cutting them up into pieces fit\r\nfor transporting to their lodges.  We had crossed no rivers on our way,\r\nand when we came to encamp at night it was found that no water had been\r\nbrought, nor were we likely to get any till we reached the encampment.\r\n\r\nWe all suffered much from thirst.  I do not recollect, indeed, having\r\never endured so much torture as I did during the next day's ride back.\r\nThe Indians, perhaps, bore the want of water better than we did.  It\r\nseemed as if we should drink the stream dry which bubbled up out of the\r\nhillside near the camp.  It took us a whole day to recover.\r\n\r\nWe had intended returning to the fort; but as we required a large supply\r\nof buffalo meat, Alick engaged the chief to hunt for us, and consented\r\nto accompany him on another excursion.\r\n\r\nMartin, Robin, and I were of course perfectly ready, and set out again\r\nwith as much glee as at first.  The buffaloes had, however, by this time\r\nretired a long way to the south, and it took us three days to come up\r\nwith them.  I need not describe another hunt.  On this occasion the herd\r\nwas more scattered.  We galloped in among them, firing right and left.\r\nEach man, when he shot an animal, dropped some article upon the carcass\r\nto show by whose prowess it had been killed.\r\n\r\nFull thirty fat animals were killed, and as the meat in its present\r\ncondition could not be carried so far, we formed a camp, and the Indians\r\ncut the flesh up in long strips, which were dried in the sun; a\r\nconsiderable portion also being beaten up into almost a paste, was mixed\r\nwith the fat to form pemmican.  This was then pressed into bags of skin,\r\nand done up into packages ready for transport.\r\n\r\nThe process is a simple one, but much labour must be expended on it.\r\n\r\nAll this time we had scouts out, not to look after the buffalo, but to\r\nwatch lest any enemies might be in the neighbourhood.  Several horses\r\nhaving been sent for, the pemmican and fresh meat were packed on them,\r\nand we set off on our return to the Cree camp.\r\n\r\nOn our arrival there the chief informed us that he had notice of a large\r\nherd of moose being in the neighbourhood; and Alick was very anxious to\r\nobtain some, as the flesh is excellent.  From their wary nature the\r\nmoose are, however, very difficult to kill.  We accordingly, having\r\ndispatched the laden animals with some of our own men, accompanied the\r\nchief with another party in the direction where we expected to fall in\r\nwith the moose.\r\n\r\nThe moose is also called the elk.  It is the largest of all the deer\r\ntribe, sometimes attaining the height of seven feet at the shoulders,\r\nbeing thus as tall as many ordinary elephants; the horns are enormous,\r\ntheir extremities widely palmated, and so heavy are they that it seems a\r\nwonder how the animal can carry them.  It has a large muzzle, extremely\r\nelongated, which gives it a curious expression of countenance which is\r\nfar from attractive.  When it moves it goes at a long, swinging trot,\r\nwhich enables it to get over the ground at great speed, and it is\r\nsurprising how the creature with its enormous horns can manage to pass\r\nthrough the woods in the way it does.  It then throws back its horns on\r\nits shoulders, and calculates the measurement exactly, as it rarely if\r\never is caught by them in the branches.  It can swim capitally, and\r\noften takes to the water in the summer months for its own amusement.\r\nOver hard ground it is difficult to keep up with it.  When the snow is\r\ndeep the heavy feet of the moose sink into it at every step, so that it\r\nis easily captured during the winter.  Its colour is a dark brown, with\r\na yellowish hue thrown over parts of it.\r\n\r\nAs it is as wary as most of the deer tribe, it is difficult to stalk.\r\nAt the same time, if the hunter knows what he is about, and keeps well\r\nto leeward and under cover, he can frequently get near enough for a\r\nshot; but his powder must be strong and his gun true, or his bullet will\r\nnot penetrate the animal's thick skin.\r\n\r\nWe killed three elk in as many different ways: one by stalking up to it,\r\nanother by lying hid behind some bushes till it came near enough to\r\nreceive the fatal shot, and a third by following it up on horseback.\r\nThe last chase was the most exciting, and had we not got on to some\r\nswampy ground, I believe that after all the elk would have escaped us;\r\nbut heading it we got a fair shot at its chest, which brought it to the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nThe next day Robin and I again accompanied the Indian chief on foot, in\r\nchase of moose.  We caught sight of a large animal feeding in the open,\r\nbut could not for a long time get near it.  At last it moved off, and we\r\nfollowed till it approached a small pond with a reedy island towards one\r\nend of it.  The moose plunged into the pond and swam towards the reeds,\r\namong which it disappeared.  There was apparently no firm footing for\r\nit, and it must have remained almost if not entirely under water.\r\n\r\nThe chief declared that it was hiding itself beneath the surface, and\r\nthat if we would wait patiently we should see it again come up, when we\r\nshould to a certainty kill it.  We, accordingly, moving cautiously round\r\nthe pond, hid ourselves among the reeds in a spot from whence we could\r\nsee the place where the moose disappeared.  We must have remained\r\nupwards of an hour, when at length the moose rose to the surface, and,\r\nswimming a short distance, began to wade towards where we were\r\nconcealed.  We were afraid of moving, even to get our guns pointed at\r\nit, lest we should startle it--as these animals are very sharp of\r\nhearing--and it should swim off in the opposite direction.\r\n\r\nNearer and nearer it came, till it was well within shot, when the chief\r\nmade a sign with his head, and Robin and I fired.  The moose made one\r\ndesperate plunge, then fell over dead.  The chief had reserved his fire,\r\nlest we should have missed.  He now, giving us his gun, rushed into the\r\nwater, and dragged the dead moose to shore.  He was highly pleased at\r\nour success; for the Indians consider the moose more difficult to take\r\nthan any other animal.  It is more vigilant than either the buffalo or\r\nthe caribou, more prudent and crafty than the antelope.  In the most\r\nviolent storm, when the wind and the thunder and the falling timber are\r\nmaking the loudest and the most incessant roar, if the hunter even with\r\nhis foot or his hand breaks the smallest dry twig in the forest, the\r\nmoose will hear it; and though it does not always run, it ceases eating,\r\nand bends its attention to all sounds.  If in the course of an hour the\r\nhunter neither moves nor makes the least noise, the moose may possibly\r\nagain begin to feed, but does not forget what he has heard, and for many\r\nhours afterwards is more vigilant even than before.  Our friend told us\r\nthat the moose is never found among the caribou, nor the latter among\r\nthe former.  The moose frequents the prairie where the buffalo feeds,\r\nwhile the caribou generally inhabits low and swampy regions.\r\n\r\nThe chief begged us to remain by the animal we had killed, while he\r\nreturned to the lodges, that he might send the horses to bring home the\r\nmeat, with two others for us to ride.\r\n\r\nWith the supplies our own hunters were likely to obtain, we calculated\r\nthat we should have enough food for ourselves.\r\n\r\nWe had now been much longer from the fort than we intended, so we at\r\nlast bade our friends good-bye, and rode forward northward alone.  We\r\nshould have, we calculated, a couple of nights to pass in the open air;\r\nbut we were all well accustomed to this sort of life, and thought it no\r\nhardship.  Our Cree friends purposed moving southward, and told us that\r\nwe should not be likely to see them again for some time.\r\n\r\nAs it was impossible for us to carry our share of the moose flesh with\r\nus, we had arranged with the chief that he should build what is called a\r\n\"sunjegwun,\" a high scaffold, on the top of which it was to be deposited\r\nand then securely covered over, so that no birds of prey could reach it,\r\nwhile, from its height, even bears would not be able to climb up to the\r\ntop.  This is an ordinary method employed by the Indians for preserving\r\ntheir provisions, when they have obtained more than they can transport\r\nat a time.  Of course, it may possibly be stolen by their enemies, but\r\nthey select such spots as are not likely to be discovered.\r\n\r\nAnother risk they run is from those arrant thieves the wolverines,\r\nwhich, if they discover what is on the top of the scaffold, though they\r\ncannot climb up it, will set to work with their sharp teeth, and try to\r\ngnaw away the posts.\r\n\r\nAs, however, they are likely to find the operation a long one, the\r\nowners may return before they have accomplished it, and shoot them for\r\ntheir pains.  Our friends agreed not to place the meat \"en cache\" till\r\nthey were on the point of starting, and we hoped to be able before that\r\ntime to send our people to bring it into the fort.  We should have taken\r\nsome with us, but it required more smoking, and we could not wait till\r\nit was thoroughly cured.\r\n\r\nAlick had consulted the Cree chief as to what had become of the Sioux\r\nwho had attacked us.\r\n\r\n\"I am glad you have asked me,\" he answered: \"though they may possibly\r\nhave returned to their own country, they are very likely to come back,\r\nand endeavour to take the fort by surprise.  They are cunning as they\r\nare daring, and if they can obtain the opportunity, they are very sure\r\nto take advantage of it.  Perhaps they will wait till they can get\r\nreinforced, so that they may make sure another time of gaining the\r\nvictory.\"\r\n\r\n\"They may think that they are sure,\" answered Alick; \"but they may find\r\nthat they have made as great a mistake as before.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, my friend,\" answered the chief, \"be ever on the watch, and don't\r\ntrust them.\"\r\n\r\nSuch were nearly the last words the chief had spoken to us.\r\n\r\nThe heat was now considerable, and hardy as we were, we were glad to\r\nrest in the shade during the hotter hours of the day, notwithstanding we\r\nhad a large fire burning during the night, to scare away the wolves and\r\nbears; while one of us invariably kept watch, both for our own sakes and\r\nthat of our animals, which even many of the Crees would not scruple to\r\nsteal if they could do so without fear of discovery.\r\n\r\nWe had got within a few miles of the fort, when Alick, alongside whom I\r\nwas riding, said to me, \"I wish that I had not come on this expedition.\r\nI ought not to have left the fort so long, with only Sandy as\r\ncommandant.  He is cautious and cunning enough in the field, but I am\r\nafraid that inside the walls he may become less careful, and allow\r\nhimself to be taken by surprise.\"\r\n\r\nI laughed at Alick's anxieties, for I had never seen him in such a\r\nhumour before.\r\n\r\n\"I hope you are not exercising the gift of second-sight,\" I said; \"I\r\ndidn't know you possessed it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I trust that I do not,\" he answered.  \"Let us push forward, and we\r\nshall soon reach the fort, and know what has happened.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SEVEN.\r\n\r\nRETURN TO THE FORT--FIND IT DESTROYED--POOR SANDY AND HONEST PAT\r\nMISSING--A WATCHFUL NIGHT--THE FISH-HAWKS--ROBIN'S SUSPICIONS--NO\r\nHORSES--\"UP, BOYS, UP!\"--WE BEGIN OUR TRAMP--TURKEY EGGS VERY NICE FOR\r\nHUNGRY MEN--THE SUNJEGWUN IS REACHED--BITTER DISAPPOINTMENT--THE BEAR\r\nAND ITS CUB--I KILL THEM--ROBIN'S SOUP-POT--CREES OF THE PLAIN--OUR NEW\r\nCOMPANIONS--PICHETO--THE YOUNG CREE KILLS A BUFFALO--THE \"POUND\"--THE\r\nHUNTING PARTY--THE CHIEF IS WILLING TO TRADE--OFFERS US HORSES FOR OUR\r\nGUNS--THE FEAST.\r\n\r\nAs we approached the fort towards the end of the day we looked out for\r\nthe flag, which we expected to see floating over it, but it was not\r\nvisible.\r\n\r\n\"Can Sandy have forgotten to hoist it?\" observed Alick.  \"It is yet too\r\nearly for him to have hauled it down.  Expecting us, he would certainly\r\nhave kept it flying till dark.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps your prognostications of evil may have come true,\" I said,\r\nlaughing, not at all thinking that such was the case.\r\n\r\n\"I trust not,\" answered Alick, in a grave tone.  \"I shall never forgive\r\nmyself if any misfortune has happened during my absence from the fort.\r\nI ought to have remained at my post; though Sandy is so cautious and\r\nvigilant that I considered he would take as good care of it as I could.\"\r\n\r\nMartin and Robin now trotted up to us.\r\n\r\n\"What has become of the flag?\" exclaimed Martin.  \"Robin says that he\r\nhas seen suspicious signs of Indians having been in the neighbourhood,\r\nand see!  I've picked up this arrow-head.  It looks as if it had been\r\nonly lately dropped.\"\r\n\r\nRobin confirmed what Martin had said, and expressed his fears that the\r\nfort had been again attacked.\r\n\r\n\"We shall soon know the worst, at all events,\" said Alick; and putting\r\nour horses into a gallop, we dashed forward.\r\n\r\nWe all uttered exclamations of dismay when, coming near where the fort\r\nhad stood, we beheld only a blackened ruin.  The towers had been burned\r\nto the ground, the palisades pulled down and destroyed, as was every\r\nwooden building inside the enclosure.\r\n\r\n\"This has not happened by accident,\" observed Alick.  \"My worst\r\napprehensions are fulfilled.  The Indians must have attacked the fort,\r\nand having succeeded in capturing it, put the whole garrison to death.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps some may have escaped, and are hidden in the neighbourhood,\"\r\nsaid Martin; and before Alick could stop him, he shouted out at the top\r\nof his voice, \"Hillo! any one hereabouts?  Answer, friends.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stay!\" cried Alick; \"our voices may be heard by foes as well as\r\nfriends.  Keep a look round; in case the former should appear, we may\r\nhave to fly for our lives.\"\r\n\r\nWe followed his injunctions.\r\n\r\n\"Alas! alas! poor Sandy and honest Pat and the rest.  What has been\r\ntheir fate?\"  I said to myself.  We kept tight rein on our horses, ready\r\nto turn round and gallop off in the direction Alick might select; but\r\nnot a human being appeared.  We first made a circuit of the fort, and\r\nexamined the only shelter near at hand in which an enemy might be\r\nconcealed; but no one was discovered.  We then rode into it, expecting\r\nto find some signs which might inform us what had become of the\r\ngarrison.\r\n\r\nThat the fort had been attacked by Indians was now clear, for several of\r\nour men lay dead among the ruins, their bodies fearfully charred, while\r\nthey had all been scalped.  We searched everywhere for Sandy and Pat,\r\nbut could not discover the corpses of either of them.  They might have\r\nescaped, or too probably, perhaps, fallen into the hands of the enemy,\r\nand been carried off to meet with a worse fate.  It made us feel very\r\nsad indeed.\r\n\r\nFurther examination showed us that the fort had been plundered of the\r\nstores, provisions, and ammunition; not a particle of food had been left\r\nbehind.  We had too much reason also to fear that the buffalo meat\r\nobtained in our late hunting expedition had been captured by the enemy,\r\neither before or after it had been brought into the fort.\r\n\r\nDarkness found us still occupied in the melancholy task of searching\r\namong the ruins.\r\n\r\n\"What are we to do now?\"  I asked.\r\n\r\n\"We must make the best of our way to Fort Ross, with the tidings of what\r\nhas happened,\" answered Alick.\r\n\r\n\"But our horses are knocked up, and we can go no distance to-night,\" I\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\"That is indeed too true!  We shall have to camp out in the most\r\nsheltered spot near at hand, and allow our horses time to feed, though\r\nwe shall have to go without our suppers,\" said Alick.\r\n\r\nWith heavy hearts we rode out of the fort towards the nearest spot which\r\nwould afford a shelter during the night.  We might have remained in the\r\nfort itself; but the dead bodies of the garrison emitted an odour which\r\nwould have rendered that disagreeable in the extreme.\r\n\r\nHaving turned our horses loose, we managed to collect some sticks for a\r\nfire, which soon burned up.  We then lay down supperless, with our\r\nsaddles as pillows, and endeavoured to recruit our strength by sleep.\r\nOne of us in succession tried to remain awake to keep watch, but I am\r\nafraid that both Martin and I dozed considerably when we ought to have\r\nhad our eyes open.\r\n\r\nWe were unmolested during the night, but when daylight returned and we\r\nlooked about for our horses, they were nowhere to be seen.  They had,\r\nperhaps, found their way to their favourite pastures, where they were\r\nlikely to meet with their former companions.\r\n\r\n\"We shall have a long tramp in search of them, but I make no doubt shall\r\nfind them at last,\" said Alick.\r\n\r\nThough my brother tried thus to reassure us, the disappearance of our\r\nhorses was a serious matter.  It was not pleasant to have to carry our\r\nsaddles in addition to the knapsacks we each of us had at our backs.\r\n\r\n\"The first thing we have to do is to try and get something for\r\nbreakfast,\" observed Martin.  \"If we had but some fishing-lines or nets,\r\nwe might easily get some fish which could quickly be cooked.\"\r\n\r\n\"As we have neither one nor the other, we must be content with whatever\r\nwe can obtain,\" I observed.\r\n\r\nRobin proposed that we should at once go down to the river, on the banks\r\nof which we might possibly obtain some wild-fowl; and as we were too\r\nhungry to discuss the pros and cons for any length of time, we\r\nimmediately set out.  Not far off a stream ran into the river, and we\r\nhoped that near its mouth we might meet with some wild ducks.  We had\r\nnot gone far when Martin exclaimed, \"I see some birds; we shall have one\r\nof them before long.\"\r\n\r\nGreat was our disappointment on going a little farther to discover that\r\nthe birds whose wings had attracted Martin's attention were fish-hawks,\r\nwhose flesh is anything but savoury; still, hungry as we were, we would\r\ngladly have shot one of them and breakfasted off it till better food\r\ncould be procured.  There were several of these birds congregated on a\r\ntree overhanging the stream.  Presently one of them which had been\r\nperched on a branch pounced downwards into the water, and quickly\r\nreturned with a large fish, with which it rose above the surface.  It\r\nseemed wonderful that the bird could lift so heavy a weight.\r\n\r\nThe fish struggled in the claws of its captor.\r\n\r\n\"We must manage to have that fish,\" exclaimed Alick.  And we ran on,\r\nintending to shoot the bird and rob it of its prey; but as it reached\r\nthe branches, in its desperate efforts to lift so heavy a weight its\r\nwings struck them, and letting go its hold, the fish fell to the ground.\r\n\r\n\"Shout! shout!\" cried Alick, and shouting together we frightened the\r\nbird at the moment it was about to pounce down to recover its prey.\r\n\r\nWe could see the fish leaping about, and just as it had almost succeeded\r\nin regaining the water, Robin caught it, and carried it again up the\r\nbank.\r\n\r\n\"Here we've an ample breakfast,\" he exclaimed, as he held it up.\r\n\"Providence has indeed been kind to us!\"\r\n\r\n\"I propose that we light a fire where we are and cook it at once,\" said\r\nMartin.\r\n\r\n\"I suggest that we move farther from the tree, as the scent is anything\r\nbut pleasant.  These hawks have made nests here, and see! the ground is\r\ncovered with the remains of their feasts,\" I observed.\r\n\r\nMy advice was followed, and we quickly had a fire kindled, and the fish\r\nwe had so unexpectedly obtained roasting before it.  It was none the\r\nworse for having been in the claws of the hawk.\r\n\r\nWe saw the birds return, and hoped that they would again act as\r\nfishermen for us; but after this they only caught small fish, which they\r\nswallowed or tore to pieces as soon as they brought them out of the\r\nwater, and as it was important for us to husband our supply of\r\nammunition, which was not too plentiful, we did not wish to throw a shot\r\naway.  The ample breakfast which the fish afforded us greatly restored\r\nour strength and spirits, and enabled us to consider calmly what course\r\nit would be best to pursue.\r\n\r\n\"The first thing we have to do is to find our horses,\" said Alick.  \"We\r\nwill then return to obtain the meat which our Cree friends were to leave\r\n`en cache' for us.  Having obtained as much provision as we can carry,\r\nwe will then push on to Fort Ross, for it is obvious that we can do no\r\ngood by remaining in this neighbourhood.  When there, I hope that Mr\r\nMeredith will send notice to headquarters, and that a body of men may be\r\ncollected to rebuild the fort before the fall, or, if not, early in the\r\nspring.  It will not do to let the Indians suppose that they can drive\r\nus out of the country.\"\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the weight we had to carry, consisting of our guns and\r\nammunition, and a change of clothing with the few other articles in our\r\nknapsacks, and our saddles and bridles, we walked quickly on.  About\r\nmidday we reached the valley where we expected to find the horses, but\r\nnot an animal was to be seen.\r\n\r\nRobin, on examining the ground, declared that Indians had been there\r\nlately, and we discovered before long indubitable signs that such was\r\nthe case.  It was too clear, therefore, that after the attack on the\r\nfort they had lifted all our cattle.\r\n\r\nWhat, however, could have become of our own horses was the question.\r\nThey possibly might have followed the tracks of their companions.  Alick\r\nthought not.\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid,\" he said, \"that our enemies may still be hovering about,\r\nand that they, either last night or early this morning, having fallen in\r\nwith our steeds, have carried them off.\"\r\n\r\nAs he was not very confident of this, we continued searching about in\r\nevery direction, following the tracks which we supposed they might have\r\nmade.  We had also to be cautious, lest our enemies should really be\r\nnear at hand; in which case they might suddenly attack us.  Worn out\r\nwith fatigue, we were at last obliged to sit down near a wood, in a very\r\ndisconsolate condition.\r\n\r\nHad there been any wild fruits ripe, we might have satisfied our hunger,\r\nbut there was nothing eatable we could obtain.\r\n\r\n\"Are we to continue our search for the horses, or must we give it up?\"\r\nI asked.\r\n\r\n\"It's useless, I fear, to hunt for them further,\" said Alick.  \"I feel\r\nvery sure that the Sioux have carried them off; and we too shall\r\nprobably fall into their hands, unless we beat a rapid retreat from this\r\npart of the country.\"\r\n\r\nHaving duly discussed the matter, it was at last agreed that we should\r\nat once make our way to the \"cache\"--that is to say, the high platform I\r\nhave described--and supply ourselves with food.  We might there, if the\r\nIndians had not left the neighbourhood, obtain horses and get some of\r\nthem to escort us.\r\n\r\n\"But if the Indians have left the neighbourhood, what are we to do?\"\r\nasked Martin.\r\n\r\n\"We must tramp it on foot,\" said Alick.  \"A couple of hundred miles is\r\nnothing; we can accomplish it in ten days, even though we may be pretty\r\nheavily-laden.  I wish that we could get there sooner, and make more\r\nsure of having the fort rebuilt before the winter.  I am thinking not\r\nonly of ourselves, but of the poor Indians who are accustomed to obtain\r\nassistance from us when hard pressed for food, as also of the many white\r\ntrappers who may come to the fort expecting to find shelter.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how shall we ever reach the `cache' without provisions?\"  I asked.\r\n\r\n\"We are sure to shoot something or other on the way, and we must not be\r\nparticular what it is or how we obtain it,\" answered Alick.\r\n\r\nWe had nothing to do but to get up and go on, with our saddles on our\r\nbacks.  Had we not hoped to obtain horses from our Cree friends, we\r\nshould have left them behind us, fastened to the bough of a tree out of\r\nthe way of bears.  Still we sat on for some minutes, lost in our own\r\nreflections.\r\n\r\n\"Up, boys, up! we'll begin our tramp,\" said Alick, setting the example\r\nand springing to his feet.  We followed him, and he having laid the\r\ncourse, we pushed forward rapidly.\r\n\r\nWe were fain to endure the pangs of hunger all that day, for nothing did\r\nwe see to kill.  We talked of the fate of our late companions.  Martin\r\nthought it possible that some might have escaped.  He could scarcely\r\nbelieve that Sandy had allowed himself to be taken, and he suggested\r\nthat, when everything was lost, he might have slipped down to the side\r\nof the river and perhaps got off in a canoe.  When he said this I\r\nregretted that we had not examined the river more narrowly.\r\n\r\nThe canoes belonging to the fort were kept in a cave with a shed built\r\nin front of it which was not visible from the ground above, and any\r\npeople escaping from the fort might have got down during the night, and,\r\nhaving launched a canoe, might have shoved off before being discovered\r\nby their enemies.  Alick differed from us.  He was sure that the\r\nIndians, when once they had obtained an entrance into the fort, would\r\nhave kept too vigilant a watch to allow any one to get out without being\r\nperceived.\r\n\r\nIt was now too late to go back to decide this point, but he agreed,\r\nshould our Cree friends have already gone to the southward, to return,\r\nand instead of proceeding overland to Fort Ross, to try to make our way\r\ndown the river in a canoe.  This seemed altogether the most feasible\r\nplan.  When once embarked, we should run less risk of meeting with\r\nhostile Indians; though, on the other hand, we should be unable to kill\r\nany buffalo or other wild animals except deer, which we might possibly\r\nmeet when they came down to drink at the margin of the stream.  I felt\r\nmuch happier when this plan was arranged.  I knew what it was to trudge\r\nday after day over the prairie, and though we might be able to find our\r\nway in fine weather, should the sky become cloudy or rain come on we\r\nmight have a difficulty in doing so.\r\n\r\nWe marched on till near dark, in vain looking out for game, and at last\r\nwere compelled to encamp.  We chose the spot on account of a small\r\nstream from which we could obtain water.  I suppose the cold draught\r\nassisted to keep away the pangs of hunger, though substantial food would\r\nhave been more acceptable.  We of course lighted a fire, and lay down to\r\nsleep by it.\r\n\r\nIn the morning we all found that we had been dreaming of buffalo humps\r\nand deers' tongues, and only wished that we had the reality before us.\r\nHaving no breakfast to cook, we were able to start immediately it was\r\ndaylight.  We, of course, kept our guns in readiness to shoot anything\r\nwe might see, but we could not catch a glimpse of any of the inhabitants\r\nof the forest or the prairie.\r\n\r\nMartin was nearly sinking with fatigue, for he was less accustomed to\r\nthe sort of life than we were; and even Robin, though much younger, from\r\nhaving been long habituated to it bore it better than he did.\r\n\r\nWe were going through a wood when a bird flew out from a thick bush.  It\r\nwas a wild turkey; but before either of us could fire the bird had\r\nescaped.  Bouncer ran off in the direction the wild turkey had taken,\r\nand Alick and I followed him, but were unable to catch sight of it\r\nagain.  On our return we heard Robin and Martin shouting.  When we were\r\nnear them we saw them each holding up an egg.\r\n\r\n\"There are eight of them,\" cried out Robin--\"two a-piece.  We shan't\r\nstarve to-day.\"\r\n\r\nThey were indeed welcome, and we all expected a delicious meal off them.\r\n\r\n\"Don't be too sure,\" observed Alick.  \"Till we have broken one of them,\r\nwe don't know how long they may have been sat on.\"\r\n\r\nThis remark somewhat abated our delight.  However, we quickly settled\r\nthe point by breaking one of the eggs, when, to our infinite\r\nsatisfaction, it was found to be perfectly sweet.  Probably the turkey\r\nhad only just begun to sit.  We, of course, therefore knew that the rest\r\nwould be equally good.  Without stopping to light a fire, we each of us\r\nate an egg.  Though they were somewhat strong-tasted, we agreed that we\r\nhad never had a more delicious meal.  We carried the others, intending\r\nto dine off them, should we not obtain more substantial fare.  We walked\r\non with the same want of success as before; and about noon, feeling the\r\ngnawings of hunger, we lighted a fire, and cooked the remainder of our\r\neggs.  We found them far more satisfactory than those we had eaten raw.\r\nThe next day Alick shot a squirrel.  That, besides the eggs, was the\r\nonly food we obtained during the journey.  We found our want of\r\nbotanical knowledge a great disadvantage; for had we been acquainted\r\nwith the various products of the soil, we might not only have stayed our\r\nhunger, but obtained wholesome vegetable diet.\r\n\r\nWe were now approaching the \"cache,\" where we expected to find an\r\nabundance of venison and buffalo flesh, on which we indulged ourselves\r\nin the thoughts of banqueting and soon restoring our somewhat reduced\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\n\"There it is,\" exclaimed Martin, who had run on ahead.  \"We must get a\r\nfire lighted, and we shall soon have a fine ham roasting.  I feel as if\r\nmy teeth were in it already.\"\r\n\r\nWe reached the platform, and Alick and I climbed to the top.  What was\r\nour dismay to find that not a particle of food remained on it.  How\r\nthankful we should have been to find a single ham or a few buffalo\r\nsteaks! but neither one nor the other gladdened our eyes.  We had to\r\ndescend with the sad intelligence.  We looked blankly at each other.\r\n\r\n\"What is to be done?\" asked Martin.\r\n\r\n\"We must try and kill a moose where we killed them before,\" said Robin.\r\n\r\n\"We shall lose three days if we do, and perhaps not get one after all,\"\r\nobserved Alick.  \"We cannot afford the time.  We ought to get back at\r\nthe river, and try to make our way down it as soon as possible.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how are we to get along without food?\" urged Martin.\r\n\r\n\"We must do our best to obtain it, and trust to Providence,\" said Alick.\r\n\"Though I managed to kill but one squirrel, we may possibly meet with\r\nmore animals on our return.\"\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding what Alick said, I saw that he was very much\r\ndisappointed, as we all were, at not finding the meat, as we had\r\nexpected.  We hunted about in every direction to ascertain whether the\r\nrobbers had left any small portions behind them, but none could we\r\ndiscover.\r\n\r\nWe came to the conclusion that the thieves, whoever they were, had been\r\nwatching us and the Crees, and directly we had all left the cache, had\r\nhurried up and rifled it.\r\n\r\nRobin was of opinion that our friends had quitted their camp directly\r\nafter we set off, and that, as they must be now at a considerable\r\ndistance, it would be hopeless to try to overtake them.\r\n\r\n\"All we can do is to turn our faces once more to the north,\" said Alick.\r\n\"Come, boys, there is no use mourning over our disappointment.  Let us\r\npush ahead and keep our eyes about us.  Perhaps we shall even now get\r\nsomething for supper.\"\r\n\r\nWe followed his advice, and without another murmur we commenced our\r\nmarch.  We got over five or six miles before it grew dusk, when we\r\ncamped near a pool of fresh water, numbers of which are found in that\r\nwell-irrigated region.\r\n\r\nWhile Martin and Robin were engaged in cutting wood for a fire, Alick\r\nand I went out in different directions, in the hope, before it became\r\nperfectly dark, of obtaining something to eat.  I had gone some\r\ndistance, and as it was rapidly getting dusk, believing that it would be\r\nuseless to continue out longer, I was on my return, when I saw a small\r\nanimal, the character of which I could not make out, rapidly running\r\nbetween the trees.\r\n\r\nBefore I could get a shot at it, it had disappeared.  I went on in the\r\ndirection in which I had last seen it, when it again appeared; but\r\nbefore I could fire, a large animal, which I knew at once must be a\r\nbear, seized it in its fore paws, and carried it, I felt sure, down a\r\nhole which was close at hand.  I now knew that the small animal was a\r\nbear's cub, and that the large one must be its mother.\r\n\r\nI searched about in every direction, when I at last discovered the mouth\r\nof the hole.  The darkness prevented me from seeing the bear clearly,\r\nbut I was sure that it was at the bottom of the hole.  I accordingly\r\nfired right into it, when, on the smoke clearing away, looking down I\r\nmade out the bear lying, as I supposed, dead.\r\n\r\nI shouted to Alick to come to my assistance, but he was too far off to\r\nhear me.  Hunger made me forget the danger I might be running.  Having\r\nreloaded my gun--which Sandy had inculcated on me as the first duty of a\r\nsportsman shooting in the forest--I placed it on the ground, and\r\nstooping down, endeavoured to get hold of the bear to draw her out.\r\n\r\nThe moment I put my hand on one of her paws I heard her jaws snap.  I\r\ndrew back as quickly as I could.  It was providential that I did so, for\r\nthe bear at the same moment turned and sprang upon me, and as I\r\nretreated she kept snapping her teeth so near me that I could feel her\r\nwarm breath on my face.  How it was that she failed to seize me I cannot\r\ntell.\r\n\r\nAs I leaped out of the hole, I caught up my gun and took to flight,\r\nhoping to get behind a tree, from whence I could again take aim.\r\nLooking round, I saw the bear, followed by the cub, pursuing me.  Should\r\nI fail to kill her, she might quickly tear me to pieces.  I remembered\r\nthe caution I had received--never to fire at a she-bear with a cub until\r\nthe shot is sure to prove effectual.  The bear was close upon me, when I\r\nslipped behind a tree.  She stopped for a moment to ascertain what had\r\nbecome of me, thus giving me time to raise my piece, and the next\r\ninstant firing, I shot her through the head.  A blow from the butt end\r\nof my rifle stunned the cub, which I afterwards killed with my knife.\r\nTaking the small animal on my shoulder, I made the best of my way to the\r\ncamp, cutting a notch every now and then with my knife in the trees,\r\nthat we might return to the spot where I had left the big bear.\r\n\r\nAlick arrived at the camp just before me.  Loud shouts welcomed me as I\r\nwas seen coming in with the young bear.  The little creature was skinned\r\nin a very few seconds; and having cut it up, we placed it to roast on\r\nforked sticks before the fire.  As may be supposed, we did not wait till\r\nit was overdone, but as soon as the smaller pieces were tolerably cooked\r\nwe set to upon them.  It was remarkably fat and tender, and with the aid\r\nof Bouncer, who had the head as his share with other portions, the whole\r\nof it was speedily devoured.\r\n\r\nAs we could not have found our way through the wood in the dark, we were\r\ncompelled to let the carcass of the bear remain, hoping that the wolves\r\nwould not find it out during the night.  Next morning, accompanied by\r\nBouncer, Alick, Martin, and I set off to cut up the bear and bring in as\r\nmuch of the meat as we could carry.  Robin was left to make up the fire.\r\n\r\n\"I will see what I can do besides,\" he said.  \"I think I can manufacture\r\na pot in which we can boil some of the bear's flesh.  It will be more\r\nsatisfactory than having so much roast meat.\"\r\n\r\nWe thought he was joking, as we did not see of what materials he could\r\npossibly form his proposed pot.\r\n\r\nThe notches I had made in the trees enabled us without difficulty to\r\nfind our way to the bear.  The wolves had not discovered it, though we\r\nput to flight a couple of eagles which had scented it from afar and were\r\nabout to plunge down and feast on the carcass.\r\n\r\nAs we could not carry away the skin, we ripped it roughly away, and were\r\nnot long in cutting off the best portions of the meat, including the\r\npaws, which would make, we knew, excellent soup, should Robin really\r\nhave been able to manufacture a pot, as he had proposed.  Martin and I\r\ncarried the larger pieces between us on a long stick, while Alick\r\nfollowed with the rest on his shoulders.\r\n\r\nWe were longer absent than we had expected.  When we got back we found\r\nthat Robin had actually formed a pot of birch-bark, the outside of which\r\nhe had covered over with thick clay.  It stood half full of water, by\r\nthe side of a hole in which a fire was burning.  Round the edge of our\r\nformer fire was ranged a quantity of clean smooth stones.\r\n\r\n\"I told you that I should have a pot ready.  We shall soon have some\r\nsoup if you will cut up the bear's paws,\" he said.  \"See, I have already\r\nput in those of the cub.\"\r\n\r\n\"How will you make it boil?\" asked Martin, lifting up the pot, and\r\nfinding that the water was cold.\r\n\r\n\"All you have to do,\" said Robin, who was sitting down close to the\r\nspot, \"is to fill it with the hot stones.  We will then rake the fire\r\nout of the hole, put the pot in and cover it up, and in a short time we\r\nshall have as good soup as you ever tasted.\"\r\n\r\nBouncer, who seemed to take great interest in what was going on, drew\r\nnear to examine the pot, and would have poked his nose in had not Martin\r\ngiven him a tap on the tip of it and sent him off somewhat ashamed of\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nWhile Robin's directions were being carried out, Alick and I prepared\r\nsome of the bear's meat for roasting, and cut up the remainder into\r\nslices to dry in the sun, intending also to smoke them well before we\r\ncommenced our journey.  Though the flesh of the old bear was not so\r\ntender as that of her cub, we ate it with no little relish.\r\n\r\n\"Leave some room for the soup,\" exclaimed Robin; \"that will be ready in\r\na few minutes, and will do us more good than the roast meat.  It's a\r\npity we cannot carry some with us.\"\r\n\r\nWe accordingly stopped, and in a short time he produced the pot from the\r\nhole.  In spite of the want of salt and vegetables, the soup was\r\npronounced excellent.  We fortunately had a couple of tin cups with\r\nwhich to ladle it out.\r\n\r\nWe were on the point of starting, when Robin asserted that he heard the\r\ntramp of horses.  Putting our ears to the ground, we were convinced that\r\nhe was right, and that the sound came from the north-west, the direction\r\nfrom which the wind was blowing.  To attempt to hide would be useless,\r\nas the fire which was still burning would have betrayed us, even had the\r\nsharp eyes of the Indians not discovered our tracks.  We could only\r\nhope, therefore, that they would prove friends, who would allow us to\r\nproceed on our way, even should they refuse to supply us with horses.\r\nWe therefore, having seen to our firearms, remained where we were, with\r\nour backs to the wood, so that we might present as formidable an\r\nappearance as possible should the newcomers venture to attack us.\r\n\r\nAll hope of offering any effectual resistance, however, was dissipated\r\nwhen we saw coming round the edge of the wood a large band of half-naked\r\nwarriors, armed with bows and arrows, their hair streaming over their\r\nbacks--perfect savages in appearance.\r\n\r\n\"They are Crees of the plain,\" exclaimed Robin, \"and are, I think, on a\r\nhunting expedition.  If we make friends with them they will not harm us,\r\nas they are generally well disposed towards the white men.\"\r\n\r\nThe Crees saw us, and came galloping up, most of them flourishing their\r\nlances, while a chief who rode at their head held out his hand as a sign\r\nthat he wished to be friends with us.  The next minute we were almost\r\nsurrounded by the wild-looking horsemen.  The chief dismounted, and\r\nAlick advanced to shake hands.  We all performed the same ceremony, and\r\nthe chief then asked who we were and where we were going.  Alick replied\r\nthat our fort had been surprised and destroyed by the Blackfeet, and\r\nthat we were on our way to Fort Ross to obtain a force for punishing the\r\nmarauders.\r\n\r\n\"They are far away ere this, and you will not overtake them,\" answered\r\nthe chief.  \"It is a long journey too to perform on foot, and many days\r\nmust pass before you can get there.  Come with us.  We will entertain\r\nyou, and in the meantime will send out a band of warriors to learn the\r\ndirection your foes and ours have taken.\"\r\n\r\nI remarked that while the chief was speaking he had been eyeing our\r\npacks of provisions.\r\n\r\n\"We are somewhat hungry,\" he continued, \"for we killed nothing\r\nyesterday; and if you will share your food with us, we will amply repay\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nWe knew by this that the chiefs offer was not altogether disinterested,\r\nand Alick saw that he must make a virtue of necessity.\r\n\r\n\"You are welcome to our meat, though it will go no great way among so\r\nmany warriors,\" he answered; \"but we will show you where the carcass of\r\nthe bear is to be found, and if the eagles have left any of the meat on\r\nthe bones, there will be enough for you all.\"  This answer seemed to\r\nplease the chief greatly, and I at once volunteered to conduct some of\r\nthe band through the wood to the spot where we had left the remains of\r\nthe bear.\r\n\r\nEight of the Crees immediately leaping from their horses, which they\r\ngave in charge to their companions, set off with me.  We found two\r\nwhite-headed eagles banqueting on the bear; but as they had kept all\r\nother birds of prey at a distance, a considerable portion still\r\nremained.  I shot one of the eagles, and the other flew off; and the\r\nIndians having cut up the bear and formed it into packages for\r\ncarrying--one of them taking possession of the eagle, and another of the\r\nbear's hide--they returned with me to the camp.  The flesh thus obtained\r\nwas quickly roasted, or rather burned, in our fire, when it was rapidly\r\nconsumed by the hungry horsemen; Bouncer, who at first showed his anger\r\nat the intrusion of the strangers, standing by and catching the scraps\r\nthrown to him.\r\n\r\nThe chief condescended to eat some of our store, which was certainly\r\nmore tempting than the meat just obtained.  The eagle, which had been\r\nskinned and cut up, formed part of the feast.  The Indians, who were put\r\ninto good humour by the ample supply of food they had obtained so\r\nunexpectedly after their long fast, laughed and joked, and assured us of\r\ntheir friendship.  Alick on this observed that we should prefer carrying\r\nout our previous intentions, for we had still food enough left for our\r\njourney; but the Cree chief had evidently made up his mind that we\r\nshould accompany him.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot permit you to encounter the risk you would run by making the\r\njourney on foot,\" he answered.  \"If you will come with us, you shall\r\nhave horses, and perhaps some of our people will escort you.\"\r\n\r\nAll the arguments Alick could use were of no avail.  We found that,\r\nnotwithstanding the fair speaking of the chief, we were in reality\r\nprisoners.  As the band had no spare horses, we each of us had to mount\r\nbehind a Cree; far from a pleasant position, as we had to hold on with\r\none hand, while we carried our guns in the other, and had also our packs\r\non our backs.\r\n\r\nBouncer followed, keeping at a respectful distance from the heels of the\r\nhorses, which showed a very unfriendly disposition to kick him when he\r\ncame near.  We rode on for some distance to the south-east, when we came\r\nin sight of the skin-covered tents forming a large Cree encampment.  The\r\nwomen rushed out to welcome their husbands and brothers, staring at us\r\nand inquiring who we were.\r\n\r\nThe chief, who by-the-bye was called Picheto, having informed them, they\r\ninvited us into their tents.  They had been busy collecting a quantity\r\nof the mesaskatomina berry, which they were drying for a winter store.\r\nThey offered us some of the juicy fruit, which we found most refreshing,\r\nafter having gone so long without any vegetable diet.  They then placed\r\nbefore us pounded buffalo meat, with marrow fat, served up in birch-bark\r\ndishes.  We followed the plan of the Indians, which was to dip a piece\r\nof the pounded meat into the soft marrow fat at each mouthful.\r\n\r\nAt night we were invited to lie down to rest around the fire which was\r\nin the centre of the tent; but the heat and smoke, with the close air of\r\nso many human beings crowded together, snoring loudly, after the fresh\r\natmosphere to which we had been accustomed, prevented us from sleeping\r\ntill near morning.  At dawn, after a hasty breakfast of more buffalo\r\nmeat and marrow fat, washed down with a drink formed of the\r\nmesaskatomina berries, we each mounted a horse provided for us by the\r\nchief Picheto.\r\n\r\nJust before starting we witnessed the prowess of a young Cree, the son\r\nor nephew of the chief.  A valley was in front of us, on the opposite\r\nside of which a buffalo bull appeared.  Urging on his horse the young\r\nCree dashed forward, armed with his bow from the \"bois-d'arc,\" his\r\narrows from the mesaskatomina tree, feathered with the plumes of the\r\nwild duck, and headed with a barb fashioned from a bit of iron hoop.\r\n\r\nHe dismounted at the foot of the steep sides of the valley, which he\r\nquickly ascended; leaving his horse at liberty, and approaching a huge\r\nboulder, he crouched down behind it.  The buffalo was at the time not\r\nforty yards from him.  While slowly approaching, the animal leisurely\r\ncropped the tufts of the parched herbage.  When about twenty yards\r\nnearer, the bull raised his head, sniffed the air, and began to paw the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nLying at full length, the Cree sent an arrow into the side of his huge\r\nantagonist.  The bull shook his head and mane, planted his fore feet\r\nfirmly in front of him, and looked from side to side in search of his\r\nunseen foe, who, after letting fly his arrow, had again crouched down\r\nbehind the rock.  The Indian, now observing the fixed attitude of the\r\nanimal--a sure sign of its being severely wounded--stepped on one side\r\nand showed himself.  The bull instantly charged, but when within five\r\nyards of his nimble enemy, the Cree sprang behind the rock, and the\r\nanimal plunged headlong down the hill, receiving as he went a second\r\narrow in his flanks.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the bottom he fell on his knees, looking over his shoulder\r\nat the Indian, who was close behind him, and now observing the bull's\r\nhelpless condition, sat down a short distance off, waiting for the\r\ndeath-gasp.  After one or two efforts to rise, the huge beast dropped\r\nhis head and fell over dead.\r\n\r\nWithout a moment's pause, the Cree, knife in hand, springing forward,\r\ncut out the animal's tongue, caught his horse, which had been eagerly\r\nwatching the conflict, and came galloping across the valley towards us,\r\nbeing received with loud shouts by his companions.\r\n\r\n\"He's a fine youth,\" observed the chief Picheto; \"before many years are\r\nover he will be able to count the scalps of the Blackfeet he has killed\r\nby hundreds.\"\r\n\r\nTowards evening we reached another Cree encampment, from which we could\r\nsee some distance off, in a dale between low hills, a large pound formed\r\nfor the purpose of capturing buffalo.\r\n\r\nWe were hospitably entertained by the Crees, and the night was spent as\r\nour former one had been.  The next morning we rode forward to visit the\r\npound which I will briefly describe.  It consisted of a large circle of\r\nstout stakes, driven into the ground perpendicularly, close together.\r\nThere was one opening, at the entrance of which a strong tree trunk was\r\nplaced about a foot from the ground, and at the inner side an excavation\r\nwas made sufficiently deep to prevent the buffalo from leaping back when\r\nonce in the pound.  From this entrance, on either side, gradually\r\nwidening, extended two rows of bushy posts, stuck into the ground about\r\nfifty feet apart.  The extreme distance between the outer end of the\r\nrows, which stretched to about four miles into the prairie, was about a\r\nmile and a half.  These bushy posts are called dead-men.\r\n\r\nBetween each of them an Indian was stationed, their business being,\r\nshould the buffalo attempt to break through the lines, to show\r\nthemselves, furiously waving their robes and immediately again hiding.\r\nThis effectually prevents the buffalo, when rushing on at full speed,\r\nfrom going out of the direct course.  The chief invited us to take part\r\nin the sport; which of course we readily consented to do.  All\r\narrangements having been made, a part of the band, numbering some fifty\r\nor sixty men, armed with bows and arrows, with no other garments than\r\ntheir breech-clouts, set off on horseback in two divisions, followed by\r\na number of men on foot, who concealed themselves as we went along in\r\nany holes or behind any hillocks they could find.\r\n\r\nThe two parties gradually separated--the one keeping on one side, the\r\nother on the opposite side of a large herd of buffaloes, which we saw\r\nbefore us.  They both galloped on till they reached the rear of the\r\nherd, leaving a few horsemen behind on the flanks.  Having gained this\r\nposition, the Indians set up a shout which was almost as terrific as the\r\nwar-whoop we had lately heard, and then dashed forward, shouting as they\r\nwent.\r\n\r\nThe startled buffaloes looked round, and seeing no opening free of their\r\nenemies by which they could escape, except that in the direction of the\r\npound, throwing up their tails and bending down their heads dashed madly\r\nforward towards it.  The Indians renewed their shouts, closing in on the\r\naffrighted buffaloes, and every now and then, as a horseman got near the\r\nanimals, he shot one of his arrows, which, though it failed to bring the\r\ncreature to the ground, made it gallop on still more furiously than\r\nbefore, plunging its horns into the rear of its companions in front.\r\n\r\nThus the herd was rapidly driven between the rows of dead-men I have\r\ndescribed.  When once here there was but little chance of their breaking\r\nthrough; for immediately they turned to one side or the other, up\r\nstarted several Indians, who had been concealed, shouting and shaking\r\ntheir robes.  In this way the terror-stricken animals were kept within\r\nthe narrowing limits of the two converging lines.\r\n\r\nSeveral had fallen, pierced by the arrows of the hunters.  Now and then\r\none would turn upon its pursuers, only to meet with certain death from\r\ntheir weapons.  Thus on they went till they reached the trunk at the\r\nentrance of the pound, over which they madly sprang, and were now\r\ncompletely hemmed in by the stout palisades.  We pursued them till the\r\nwhole herd was inside.\r\n\r\nIn vain the animals galloped round and round the pound, endeavouring to\r\nfind an exit.  The instant one of them appeared likely to charge the\r\npalisades, the Indians--men, women, and children--who were placed round\r\nit started up, shrieking lustily and shaking their robes or any cloths\r\nthey had in their hands.  The places of the women and children were soon\r\ntaken by the huntsmen, who shot down with their arrows the bewildered\r\nanimals, which were rapidly becoming frantic with rage and terror.\r\nUtterly unable to make their escape, conscious only that they were\r\nimprisoned, and not seeing their foes, they now rushed madly at each\r\nother, the strongest animals crushing and tossing the weaker.\r\n\r\nDreadful indeed was the scene of confusion and slaughter--the noise\r\nalmost appalling created by the shouts and screams of the excited\r\nIndians, the roaring of the bulls, the bellowing of the cows, and the\r\npiteous moaning of the calves.  It was painful to watch the dying\r\nstruggles of those powerful animals as they found themselves thus caged,\r\nand we would fain have avoided witnessing them.\r\n\r\nIt was sad, too, to think that this waste of life was to benefit but\r\nslightly its authors, who would take only the tongues and the better\r\nportions of the meat, and leave the rest of the carcass to rot.\r\n\r\n\"What do you think of it?\" asked the chief.\r\n\r\n\"That you would be wiser to kill only a few of the buffaloes at a time,\r\nsufficient to supply your immediate wants,\" said Alick.  \"The time may\r\ncome when you will repent having slaughtered so many valuable animals.\"\r\n\r\nThe chief laughed.  \"It is the way of our people,\" he answered, and\r\nAlick could get no other reply from him.\r\n\r\nA considerable portion of the meat, however, was taken off from the\r\ncarcasses and carried to the tents, where the women were employed in\r\ncutting it up into slices, afterwards drying it in the sun or pounding\r\nit into pemmican, which was preserved in the fat of the animals.\r\n\r\nWe now thanked the Cree chief for his hospitality, hoping that he would\r\nwithout demur now allow us to go.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot let you take your departure yet,\" he said, smiling grimly.\r\n\"We have plenty of good food now, and we will treat you hospitably.  My\r\nyoung men will not like to leave the camp while the fresh meat lasts.\"\r\n\r\n\"We should have been happy to have their company, but we are quite ready\r\nto set out alone,\" answered Alick.  \"If you will sell us horses, we will\r\ngive you an order in payment on Fort Ross for blankets, or anything else\r\nyou may desire.\"\r\n\r\n\"You may purchase horses even now with your guns,\" answered the chief.\r\n\"We will sell you four horses for your three guns, and leave you one\r\nwith which to kill the game you will require for your support.\"\r\n\r\nHearing what the chief said, we now guessed the object he had in\r\ncapturing us.  We were determined, of course, not to part with our guns,\r\nas without them we could neither kill game nor defend ourselves.\r\n\r\nAlick told the chief that he would think about the matter, but that at\r\npresent we were not disposed to agree to his proposal.  We all looked as\r\nlittle annoyed as we could, and let the matter drop.  The Indians were\r\npreparing to make a great feast on the meat of the buffaloes they had so\r\nruthlessly slain, and we hoped that when gorged with food they might be\r\noff their guard and give us an opportunity of escaping.\r\n\r\nThe feast took place that night.  The squaws had been busy for some\r\nhours in cooking the flesh in a variety of ways.  We, of course, were\r\ninvited, and sat down with the chief and some of his principal men.\r\nThough generally abstemious, it is extraordinary what an amount of food\r\nthey consumed, washed down with whisky, of which they had shortly before\r\nobtained a supply from the traders.\r\n\r\nWe took but little, pretending often to be eating while we let the meat\r\ndrop down by our sides, under the mats on which we were sitting.  The\r\nIndians feasted on till a late hour of the night, when they crawled into\r\ntheir tents and lay down.\r\n\r\nThey, of course, might have deprived us of our guns by force, but from a\r\nsense of honour as we were their guests, though they carried us off\r\nagainst our will, they would not do this.  We had therefore been allowed\r\nto retain them, and took good care not to let them out of our hands\r\neither night or day.  Our packs had been left in the chief's tent, and\r\nwe used them as pillows.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes the whole of the community were fast asleep; even the\r\ndogs, the watchful guardians of a Cree encampment, had so gorged\r\nthemselves that they were unwilling to get up.  Had a party of Blackfeet\r\nmade a sudden onslaught, the whole of the inhabitants might have been\r\nslaughtered before they could have arisen to defend themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER EIGHT.\r\n\r\nOUR ABRUPT DEPARTURE--QUICK TRAVELLING--THE FORTUNATE DISCOVERY OF THE\r\nCANOE--OUR PROVISIONS RUN SHORT--THE CHASE AFTER THE SWANS--BOUNCER IN\r\nTROUBLE--OUR CANOE IS DAMAGED--ROASTED SWAN RATHER STRONG--OUR WIGWAM--A\r\nMIDNIGHT VISITOR--THE MORNING START--DUCKS--FISH-SPEARS--OUR CANOE\r\nWRECKED--OUR DANGEROUS SITUATION--A ROPE MANUFACTURED--DRY LAND REACHED\r\nBY ITS MEANS--SWAN MEAT AGAIN.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Alick was satisfied that the people were sound asleep, he sat\r\nup and made a sign to Martin, Robin, and me to follow him.  We found\r\nBouncer at the door.  When I patted him on the head he opened his eyes,\r\nand seeing us got on his legs ready for a start.\r\n\r\nWe waited for a few seconds to be certain that we were not observed.\r\nHad we been questioned, we had agreed to answer that we preferred the\r\nopen air to the hot tent.\r\n\r\nTo our great satisfaction, finding that no one had noticed us, we moved\r\non, stepping as noiselessly as possible, till we were free of the tents.\r\nThe night was starry, and we had noted well the way we had to go.  Of\r\ncourse we might have stolen some of the Cree horses, and very little\r\nblame would have been attached to us for so doing even had we been\r\novertaken; but some time would have been lost in catching them, and we\r\nhoped to get to a considerable distance from the camp before the Indians\r\nrecovered from their debauch.\r\n\r\nAs soon as we had got so far that there was no chance of our footsteps\r\nbeing heard, we began to run, keeping close together.  The Crees, who\r\nalways move about on horseback, were less likely than most of the\r\nIndians to discover our trail, and we felt sure that they would not\r\nfollow us on foot.  We were all in good wind, and might be twenty or\r\neven thirty miles away before they found out that we had escaped; for\r\neven when the chief awoke he would very likely turn to again and drink a\r\nfurther quantity of the fire-water.\r\n\r\nWe went on till we had passed the Cree encampment we had before visited.\r\nWe might have ventured into it, for the women who were alone there\r\nwould not have known that we were escaping, and would have consequently\r\nallowed us to continue on our way.  We thought it wiser, however, to\r\navoid paying our friends a visit, as we had enough food to last us till\r\nwe could reach the river.  After the abundant meal we had taken on the\r\nprevious evening, we could have gone on all day with very little food or\r\nrest.\r\n\r\nIn crossing a small valley we found a number of the mesaskatomina\r\nbushes, from which we obtained a supply of fruit which greatly refreshed\r\nus.  I am afraid that it will be scarcely believed that we accomplished,\r\naccording to our calculation, upwards of fifty miles before we stopped\r\nto camp at night.  Though nothing on a highroad, it was good going over\r\nthe prairie grass, with occasionally to have to make our way through\r\nwoods and across streams.\r\n\r\nWe had the satisfaction of believing that the Crees would not take the\r\ntrouble of coming after us, and we were thankful that we had not been\r\ntempted to make off with their horses, though we might have been\r\njustified in so doing.  We supped off pemmican, refraining from lighting\r\na fire lest it might betray our position.\r\n\r\nWe kept, however, a pile of sticks ready to kindle, should it become\r\nnecessary by the approach of wolves or of bears.  As usual, of course,\r\none of us kept watch, that we might have timely warning of danger.  The\r\nnight passed away without any event of importance, and the next morning,\r\nthe moment the first streaks of dawn appeared in the eastern sky, we\r\npushed forward at as rapid a rate as before.  We at last got into the\r\ncountry we knew pretty well, and in the afternoon of the third day came\r\nin sight of the spot where Fort Black had stood.\r\n\r\n\"It looks black enough now,\" observed Martin, as he surveyed the charred\r\nruins.  \"I wish I knew where my poor father and mother are!  Should the\r\nSioux have paid them a visit, I fear that they will have had great\r\ndifficulty in escaping.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think the Sioux would have gone so far north,\" observed Alick.\r\n\"They are probably better off than they would have been had they come to\r\nthe fort, when they to a certainty would have been murdered with the\r\nrest of our poor people.  Don't let us contemplate misfortunes, before\r\nwe know that they have happened.\"\r\n\r\nNot a human being was seen in the neighbourhood of the fort; neither\r\ncattle nor horses were anywhere visible.  The whole scene was one of\r\nperfect desolation.  Without entering the ruins, we at once made our way\r\ndown the bank to the spot where we hoped to find the canoes.\r\n\r\nThe door of the shed was open.  One canoe only out of three remained.\r\n\r\n\"So far that is satisfactory,\" observed Alick.  \"I trust that the rest\r\nof the men had time to get down and embark before they were discovered\r\nby the Sioux.  I wonder the rascals didn't search for them.  Had they\r\ndone so, they would have found this canoe and destroyed it.\"\r\n\r\n\"It shows, however, that only a few could have escaped--eight or ten at\r\nthe utmost.  If more had got off they would have taken all the canoes,\"\r\nsaid Robin.\r\n\r\nMartin and I agreed with the conclusions at which Alick and Robin had\r\narrived.  We examined the canoe, and found it in good condition, only\r\nrequiring to have the seams gummed.  There was not time to do that and\r\nto make any progress on our way down the river, so we agreed to spend\r\nthe night in the shed, and to commence our voyage the next morning.\r\n\r\nWe had food remaining for only two scanty meals for ourselves and\r\nBouncer, who had been almost starved during the journey, and it was\r\nsettled that we should start the first thing in the morning and go in\r\nsearch of wild-fowl.  As we had no fear of any enemies being in the\r\nneighbourhood, we lighted a good fire outside the hut, at which we\r\ncooked the remainder of our bear's flesh and ate it for supper.\r\n\r\nMartin, while hunting about in the shed, discovered a lump of the gum\r\nused for paying over the seams of canoes.  This we melted in one of our\r\ntin pots, and very soon had the canoe in a fit state to launch.  There\r\nwere several pairs of paddles, and some cloth which could be used as a\r\nsail.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps we may find something else which may prove useful,\" observed\r\nMartin, and he twisted up a torch from the dry reeds which grew on the\r\nbank.\r\n\r\nWith this we thoroughly examined the cave, and our search was rewarded\r\nby the discovery of a flask of powder, apparently dropped by one of the\r\nmen who had escaped from the fort.  We also found an axe and a long\r\nsheath-knife.  Both were likely to prove very useful.\r\n\r\nAltogether we were very thankful that we had decided on returning to the\r\nfort.  After our long and rapid journey we were all very tired, and as\r\nsoon as we had finished our search we lay down to rest without any fear\r\nof interruption.  We younger ones should have slept on, I suspect, till\r\nlong after the sun was high in the heavens, had not Alick roused us up.\r\n\r\n\"Come, boys,\" he exclaimed, \"turn out; we must have breakfast and begin\r\nour voyage as soon as we can.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought you said that we were to look out for wild-fowl,\" observed\r\nMartin.  \"I suspect that if we don't in good time we shall have to go\r\nwithout our dinner.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll have breakfast, and then talk about that,\" said Alick.  \"I want\r\nto feel that we really have begun the voyage.\"\r\n\r\nOur breakfast was a very scanty one, though we had plenty of water to\r\nwash it down; the last few morsels being given to Bouncer, who sat\r\nwistfully looking up at us as we ate our food.\r\n\r\nThe canoe was at last carefully lifted into the water; Alick took the\r\nsteering-oar, and each of us three a paddle.\r\n\r\n\"Away then we go, boys; and I pray that we may have a successful\r\nvoyage,\" said Alick.  As he spoke he gave a shove with his paddle, and\r\nwe dipping ours into the water, the canoe was soon in the middle of the\r\nstream.\r\n\r\nWe glided on rapidly with the current till we came to the mouth of a\r\nbroad stream, which ran into it from the opposite side.  As we looked up\r\nit we caught sight of some white objects.\r\n\r\n\"They are swans,\" cried Alick, \"and one of them will afford us an ample\r\ndinner.\"\r\n\r\nThe difficulty, however, was to get near the birds, for they would take\r\nto flight the moment they saw the canoe paddling towards them.\r\nFortunately the wind was up the stream.\r\n\r\n\"We will hoist the sail,\" said Alick, \"and it will assist to conceal us,\r\nwhile the canoe will glide noiselessly towards the swans.\"\r\n\r\nWe had two sticks, which we fixed in the gunwale of the canoe, setting\r\nthe sail between them.  Though of a primitive nature, it had the\r\nadvantage of being lowered in a moment.  This was very necessary in so\r\ncrank a craft as is a birch-bark canoe.  We now allowed the canoe to\r\nglide on, while we got our guns ready and watched the birds from under\r\nthe sail.  They were mere specks of white in the distance, and as we\r\nglided towards them we had no doubt that they were swans.\r\n\r\nThey must have seen the strange-looking object entering their river,\r\nfor, turning their arched necks from us, they began to swim up the\r\nstream.  A strong current was running down, which impeded our progress;\r\nwhile they avoided it by keeping close to the bank, where the water was\r\naltogether still, or was running with less force.  This gave them a\r\ngreat advantage; still, having once begun the chase we felt no\r\ninclination to give it up, hunger urging us on.\r\n\r\nThe trees in many places overhung the water, shutting out the rays of\r\nthe sun.  Here and there, however, penetrating through more open parts,\r\nthey struck on the snowy plumage of the birds, enabling us clearly to\r\nkeep them in view.\r\n\r\n\"We are getting near them,\" whispered Robin, who was peering under the\r\nsail.  \"We shall soon be close enough to make our shot tell with\r\neffect.\"\r\n\r\nWe had no intention on entering the stream of going so far out of our\r\nway.  Now having begun we were led on and on, still hoping soon to come\r\nup with the chase.  At last we reached a part where the branches of the\r\ntrees so densely overhung the water that they cast a dark shadow below,\r\nwhich almost completely concealed the canoe.\r\n\r\nThe swans, we concluded from their movements, no longer perceived us,\r\nfor they began to swim about in an unconcerned fashion, some of them\r\neven allowing themselves to be carried down by the current.  Four of\r\nthem at length got quite close to us, when Martin and I, lifting our\r\nguns, fired, and two, immediately spreading out their wings for an\r\ninstant, dropped their heads in the water.\r\n\r\nTheir companions, on seeing their fate, darted off with loud screams;\r\nwhile we, lowering our sail, got out our paddles and propelled the canoe\r\nas fast as we could to secure our prey.\r\n\r\nOne of the birds was quite dead; the other struggled violently as Robin\r\nseized it by the neck, and tried to dart its beak at him, very nearly\r\nupsetting the canoe.  As soon as Martin and I had hauled the other bird\r\non board, we went to his assistance, Martin holding the poor bird tight\r\nround the neck till its struggles ceased, when we also got it into the\r\ncanoe.\r\n\r\nWe might have been satisfied with our prizes, but we wished to obtain a\r\nsupply of provisions sufficient to enable us to continue our voyage\r\nwithout stopping to hunt.  We therefore rehoisted our sail, and made\r\nchase after the remainder of the swans.  The appearance of the stream\r\nalso tempted us to continue our course, as we thought it possible that\r\nwe might fall in with some animals--perhaps deer coming down to drink,\r\nor beavers, or smaller creatures--which might give us a variety of food.\r\nShould we be successful our intention was to land and smoke them\r\nthoroughly, so that they might last us for the remainder of the voyage.\r\n\r\nIt would take us several days we knew, at all events, to perform the\r\nvoyage, for there were rapids to be passed; and though we might shoot\r\nthem, the attempt, without being well acquainted with the navigation,\r\nwould be hazardous, and it would be far wiser, Alick considered, to make\r\na portage, or in other words to carry our canoe on our shoulders\r\noverland, till tranquil water should be reached.\r\n\r\n\"If we had fishing-lines and hooks we need have no fear of wanting\r\nfood,\" observed Martin.  \"I must try to manufacture some hooks and\r\nlines.\"\r\n\r\n\"But where are you to find iron for the hooks or material for the\r\nlines?\"  I asked.\r\n\r\n\"The first I'll form, as the Indians do, out of bone,\" answered Martin.\r\n\"They use them in the upper Saskatchewan, and on the lakes in the\r\nneighbourhood.  If we can shoot a deer, the skin and the inside will\r\nsupply us with material for the lines.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the deer must be shot first, and fitting bones found to make the\r\nhooks; and then, as to bait?\"  I observed.\r\n\r\n\"We'll try various sorts.  We may find grasshoppers or some other\r\ninsects on the shore, at which I should think several fish would bite,\"\r\nanswered Martin.  \"If not, we must dig for worms, or try the insides of\r\nthe birds or beasts we may shoot.\"\r\n\r\n\"If we do happen to shoot any; but so much depends on that little word\r\n`if,' that we must not be too sanguine,\" I remarked.\r\n\r\n\"At all events, we have already killed two swans, and should not be\r\ndoubting about our success for the future,\" answered Martin.  \"Just\r\nthink, David, how remarkably we have been hitherto preserved!  We are\r\npositively ungrateful to Heaven if we doubt that the same kind\r\nProvidence will continue to watch over us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hush, boys!\" said Alick.  \"We are again getting near the swans, and we\r\nmay kill one or two more if we approach them carefully.  Get your guns\r\nready, but don't fire too soon.  Stand by to lower the sail when I tell\r\nyou.  Do you, Martin and Robin, be prepared to get out your paddles the\r\nmoment you have fired; while you, David, must reload in case the others\r\nmiss.\"\r\n\r\nSoon after he spoke the wind failed us, and the canoe no longer stemmed\r\nthe current.  The greatest caution was now necessary to get up to the\r\nswans.  Should we use our paddles, we should frighten them, and they\r\nmight escape us.  The birds, as before, kept swimming slowly up the\r\nstream.  We waited in the hopes that the wind would again fill our sail.\r\nWe found that the canoe was slowly drifting down with the current;\r\nstill we thought that another puff of wind would come and send us along\r\nagain, and that it would be a pity to risk lowering the sail and\r\nexhibiting ourselves to the birds.\r\n\r\nThey appeared to have recovered from their former fright at the loss of\r\ntheir companions, though we saw their leader every now and then turning\r\nround his head to take a look at the suspicious object the canoe must\r\nhave presented to them floating in the middle of the stream.\r\n\r\nAgain the wind blew softly, and we once more stemmed the current.\r\n\r\n\"We are gaining on them,\" whispered Robin.  \"We must try to get up\r\nbefore they reach yonder point.  If they double it, we may lose sight of\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\nThe swans were all this time within range of our shot, but had we fired\r\nit would not have penetrated their thick feathers, and Alick charged us\r\non no account to pull a trigger.  We were thus long tantalised by seeing\r\nthe swans majestically gliding over the water ahead of us.\r\n\r\n\"They will get round the point, after all, before we are up to them,\"\r\nsaid Robin.\r\n\r\n\"Never mind if they do,\" answered Alick.  \"We'll then use our paddles,\r\nas they will not see us, and we shall very likely soon overtake them on\r\nthe other side.  There seems to be more breeze on the water out there.\r\nBe ready to hoist the sail again the moment we get off the point.\"\r\n\r\nThough we were still making way, Robin's anticipations were fulfilled,\r\nand the swans, one after another, disappeared behind the point.  The\r\ninstant they did so we lowered the sail and began paddling away with\r\nmight and main, as we hoped to find ourselves much nearer to them than\r\nwe had hitherto been.  Bouncer had sat very quietly in the boat watching\r\nall our proceedings.  He was too well-trained a dog to bark or show any\r\nsigns of impatience; he probably knew from experience that had he,\r\nindeed, attempted to swim out and attack the swans, he might receive a\r\nblow from their wings which would make him repent his temerity, for such\r\npower does the swan possess that it has been known by a single blow of\r\none of its wings to break a man's leg.\r\n\r\nWe soon got up to the point, and immediately taking in our paddles and\r\nhoisting our sail, glided noiselessly round it.\r\n\r\nGreat was our disappointment, however, to see only one swan still in the\r\nwater.  What had become of the others we could not tell.  Possibly they\r\nhad plunged into some tall reeds which in dense masses lined the right\r\nbank of the river.  That bird, however, we resolved should become our\r\nprize, and again lowering our sail we all three fired.  As the smoke\r\ncleared off, however, there swam the swan, stately as before, and\r\napparently uninjured, making for the reeds I have mentioned.\r\n\r\n\"We must have that fellow, at all events,\" cried Alick.  \"Paddle away,\r\nRobin and Martin; we shall be soon up to him.\"\r\n\r\nWhile they obeyed the order, I reloaded, determined not again to miss\r\nthe swan.\r\n\r\n\"Wait a moment,\" said Alick; \"he's still rather far off.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I wait, he'll get into the reeds.  Do let me fire,\" I answered.  But\r\nAlick did not give the word, and as we had all agreed to obey him\r\nimplicitly, I, of course, would not set a bad example, though I felt\r\nsure that I could hit the swan.\r\n\r\nThe bird turning round its long neck saw us coming, and immediately,\r\naided by its wings as well as its feet, with a loud cry darted into an\r\nopening among the reeds.\r\n\r\n\"We shall have him still,\" cried Alick; \"paddle away! paddle away!\"\r\n\r\nLaying down my gun, I seized a paddle, and in another minute we had\r\nreached the reeds where the swan had disappeared.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Bouncer, see what you can do,\" cried Alick.  The faithful old dog\r\ndid not require to receive a second order, but plunging bravely\r\noverboard, dashed into the reeds, and struggled energetically forward\r\namid them, with leaps and bounds, though he had no firm ground on which\r\nto place his feet.  We watched eagerly for the bird, which we felt sure\r\nfrom Bouncer's movements could not be far off.\r\n\r\nA large tree grew close to the bank, its roots reaching the water.  We\r\nurged the canoe forward, and presently up rose the swan, no longer\r\npresenting the same graceful appearance it did in the water.  Though its\r\nwings were powerful enough to lift it in the air, its body had a\r\nremarkably heavy, awkward appearance.\r\n\r\nBouncer would in another instant have seized it, and have had cause to\r\nrepent doing so, but the bird rose just beyond reach of his jaws.  I\r\nlifted my gun and fired, as did Robin.  Neither Martin nor Alick, on\r\naccount of the tree, could take aim.  With a loud cry the swan flew off,\r\nits white body glittering in the sun; but it had not gone far when down\r\nit came with a heavy flop on the reeds.  Bouncer dashed forward to seize\r\nit.  We, finding that the water was deep enough to allow us to make our\r\nway through the reeds, pushed the canoe in between them, thoughtless of\r\nany snags or branches which might tear a hole in her thin coating.\r\n\r\nWe had got some way when we guessed, by a white wing every now and then\r\nraised above the green herbage, that Bouncer was having a desperate\r\nstruggle with the wounded swan, and this made us the more eager to\r\nadvance, that we might hasten to his assistance.  Finding at last that\r\nthe canoe stuck fast, I stepped overboard, followed by Martin.  Scarcely\r\nhad we done so when we sank almost up to our middles in soft\r\nmud-and-water, mixed with dead branches.\r\n\r\nBeing in for it, we determined to proceed, though we advised Alick and\r\nRobin to keep quiet, which, seeing the plight we were in, they had every\r\ninclination to do.  We floundered on for some yards, when our feet\r\nreached firm ground.  As we got up the bank, we saw that Bouncer had\r\nseized the swan by the neck, and that every moment its struggles were\r\nbecoming less violent than before.  Ere we got close up to the\r\ncombatants the bird was dead; but Bouncer was bleeding at the nose, and\r\nmoved with a limp.\r\n\r\nAs we took the swan from him, he looked up in our faces as much as to\r\nsay, \"I have done it, masters; but it has cost me pretty dearly.\"\r\n\r\nWe were not aware at that time what a price we had paid for that swan.\r\nFinding that it was quite dead, we dragged it along towards the canoe;\r\ninto which we hauled it.  Bouncer followed, though not without\r\ndifficulty, and we had to help him on board.\r\n\r\n\"We must get to some better place than this for landing,\" said Alick.\r\n\"I don't know whether you are hungry, boys, but I know that I am, and\r\nthe sooner we have one of these birds roasting before a good fire the\r\nbetter pleased I shall be.  Shove off.\"  We endeavoured to obey the\r\norder.\r\n\r\n\"Very well to say shove off, but it's more than we can do,\" said Martin,\r\nturning round.\r\n\r\n\"Then you must get into the water and lift her off.  You are already wet\r\nthrough, so it will not signify.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here goes then,\" I said; and Martin and I stepped into the water, on to\r\nwhat we found to be the sunken trunk of a tree, off which we quickly\r\nlifted the canoe, though we found an unexpected resistance.  Scarcely\r\nhad we done so than we saw the water running like a mill stream into the\r\ncanoe.\r\n\r\n\"We must get out of her, or she'll fill to the gunwale in a few\r\nminutes,\" exclaimed Alick.\r\n\r\n\"We can't land here or haul her up if we do,\" I observed, as I still\r\nstood on the sunken trunk.  \"If we secure the sail under the bottom, we\r\nmay keep the water from running in so fast till we can get to the\r\nopposite bank, where there must be a fit place for landing.\"\r\n\r\nAlick agreed to my proposal, and Martin and I stooping down managed to\r\nsecure the piece of cloth, as I suggested might be done.  Robin also\r\nshoved his handkerchief into the worst leak.\r\n\r\nThe plan answered apparently better than we had expected; and Martin and\r\nI stepping on board again, we paddled the canoe as fast as we could in\r\nthe direction of the opposite bank.  We had got scarcely half across the\r\nstream, however, when the water began to rush in again more violently\r\nthan at first.  There seemed every probability of the canoe filling.  We\r\npaddled away with all our force; still the water came in.\r\n\r\n\"The only chance I see of reaching the shore is to swim for it,\" cried\r\nAlick, throwing off his heavier clothing.\r\n\r\nI did the same, and Martin imitated us.\r\n\r\n\"Sit quiet, Robin,\" said Alick.  \"Take the paddle and steer the canoe.\"\r\n\r\nPoor Bouncer would have jumped overboard also, but one of his front legs\r\npained him, and he stood quiet with the water rushing about his feet.\r\nAlick took the painter in his mouth and towed ahead, while Martin and I\r\nswam astern, pushing the canoe before us.  Robin paddled, now on one\r\nside, now on the other.  We thus proceeded towards the bank, being\r\ncarried down, however, farther than we intended by the current.  We were\r\nall three pretty well exhausted by the time we reached the shore, where,\r\nas soon as Robin had bailed her out, we hauled up the canoe, he and\r\nBouncer jumping out of her.\r\n\r\n\"We shall have to camp here,\" said Alick, \"for it will be nearly dark\r\nbefore we can repair the canoe, and cook one of the swans, and get our\r\nclothes dried.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suggest that we get our clothes dried first,\" said Martin.  \"We are\r\nhardy fellows, but we may catch cold notwithstanding if we remain in our\r\nwet garments.\"\r\n\r\nAgreeing with him, we all set to work to collect wood for a large fire,\r\nbefore which, as soon as it burned up brightly, he and I spread out our\r\nclothes, while we sat down wrapped in Alick's and Robin's thick coats,\r\nwhich had been kept dry.  They meanwhile searched for some gum and\r\nbirch-bark wherewith to repair our damaged canoe.  Martin and I employed\r\nourselves in plucking one of the swans and preparing it for cooking.  I\r\nproposed cutting it into several portions, that it might cook the\r\nsooner; but he advocated cooking it whole, declaring that it would not\r\ntake much longer to dress than if cut up, and be far better.  We were\r\nstill discussing that knotty point, when Alick came up and settled it in\r\nfavour of Martin's proposal.\r\n\r\n\"One long spit, which we can tend better than several small ones, will\r\nthen serve the purpose,\" he observed.\r\n\r\nBeing hung up close to the fire, our lower garments were soon dried, and\r\nwhile the swan was cooking we again examined our canoe.  So extensive\r\nwas the rent that we found it would be necessary to sew on a piece of\r\nbirch-bark, and then to cover the seams over with gum.  We fortunately\r\nfound some fibre which would answer the purpose of thread.  The\r\noperation of sewing in the piece was a long one, as every hole had to be\r\ncarefully made and the fibre passed through it and secured; the only\r\ntool we had to work with being a small pricker from Alick's\r\npocket-knife.\r\n\r\nRobin had remained by the fire to tend the roasting of the swan, and as\r\nwe worked away we every now and then shouted to him to know how the swan\r\nwas getting on.\r\n\r\n\"Pretty well,\" he answered, \"but it would be all the better for basting,\r\nas it seems to dry very fast, and has somewhat of a fishy odour.\"\r\n\r\n\"We must not be particular,\" said Alick; \"and the sooner you can manage\r\nto get it done the better, for I am sharp set, and so, I am sure, are\r\nMartin and David.\"\r\n\r\n\"The scent has taken off my appetite,\" said Robin, as he continued to\r\nturn the spit.\r\n\r\nWe at last got the piece of bark sewn on, and had then to heat the gum\r\nwhich Alick had collected.  It required a good quantity, as it was not\r\nequal to what we had before obtained.  We were rather afraid that it\r\nwould fall out and allow the canoe to leak.\r\n\r\nBy the time we had accomplished part of our task Robin announced that\r\nthe swan was cooked, and as we found it difficult to labour by the light\r\nof the fire, we put off finishing the repairs of the canoe till the next\r\nmorning.  With appetites ravenous from long fasting we sat down round\r\nthe fire to eat the swan.  It had the advantage of being hot, but\r\npossessed no other commendable quality, being somewhat tough and of a\r\nstrong flavour; still it completely satisfied our hunger, and Bouncer,\r\nat all events, made no objection to the portion we gave him.  He had\r\nbeen much more quiet than usual, having stretched himself by Robin's\r\nside, and remained in that position till he got up to eat his supper.\r\nHe seemed much better after it, though he still limped when he attempted\r\nto walk, and his nose showed the scars which the swan's beak had made on\r\nit.  Had he been capable of any feeling of revenge, it would have\r\nafforded him infinite satisfaction to know that he was devouring his\r\nlate antagonist; but such a thought did not enter his canine mind.\r\nThere was the food; he ate it, and was grateful.\r\n\r\nBy the time supper was over all our clothes were dry, and we put them on\r\nto prepare ourselves for the night.  The air felt much cooler than\r\nusual, so we determined to build a wigwam in which to shelter ourselves.\r\nIt would also give us some slight protection from bears or wolves.  We\r\ndid not expect to be annoyed by any of the latter on this side of the\r\nriver, but it was very probable that a grizzly or black bear might pay\r\nus a visit; for they roam throughout the whole of the Hudson Bay\r\nTerritory, the white bears taking their place in the more northern\r\nregions.  The axe we had found enabled us quickly to cut down some long\r\npoles to form the framework of the wigwam.  As there were numerous large\r\nbirch trees about, we soon collected a sufficient number of slabs of\r\nbark to cover it.  Some were of considerable size, and all we had to do\r\nwas to place them on their ends against the conical framework of poles.\r\nIn a few minutes we had a serviceable wigwam formed.  As after our\r\nfatigues we were anxious to have comfortable couches, we cut down the\r\ntops of a number of small spruce firs, with which we covered the floor,\r\nusing our knapsacks for pillows, and before long three of us were fast\r\nasleep.\r\n\r\nAlick, who was better able than any of us to endure fatigue, agreed to\r\nkeep the first watch.  I took the watch after him.  Though I paced up\r\nand down before the fire, I had great difficulty in keeping my eyes\r\nopen.  The murmur of the stream as it flowed by, and the suppressed hum\r\nof insects with the occasional cry of some bird, had a very soporific\r\neffect.  I kept walking about and stamping my feet, but every moment I\r\nstopped my head began to nod; and when I got a little distance from the\r\nfire and turned round to look at it, I could not make out whether it was\r\nthe sun or the moon just rising.  I pinched myself, and sang, and walked\r\nfaster up and down.  When I stopped for a moment the same overpowering\r\ndrowsiness came over me.\r\n\r\nI had gone to the farthest extent of my beat, when I thought that I\r\nwould just lean against a tree for a few seconds to rest, myself.  It\r\nwas an imprudent act, and the consequences might have been serious.  I\r\nremember that I felt myself sinking down, but the movement fortunately\r\naroused me.  I just then heard the cracking of branches and a low growl.\r\nTurning round, the light from the fire revealed to me a huge hairy\r\ncreature not ten paces off.\r\n\r\nIt was a bear! but whether a black or a grizzly I could not make out.\r\nThe latter would prove a formidable enemy, and I knew that if I ran\r\ntowards the fire he would run after me.  I therefore stood where I was,\r\ncocking my piece and shouting loudly to my companions, \"A bear! a bear!\r\nUp, up, or he'll be upon us.\"\r\n\r\nIn a moment they all three, awakened by my cries, started to their feet.\r\n\r\n\"Don't fire,\" cried Alick, \"till we are ready; or should you only wound\r\nhim, he'll make a rush at you.\"\r\n\r\nAlick's advice was sound, though it lost us the bear; for the animal,\r\nseeing so many opponents ready to do battle with him, turned tail and\r\nran off through the forest.  We followed for a short distance, but he\r\nmade his way amid the trees much faster than we could; and not knowing\r\nthe nature of the locality, Alick thought it wiser to return.\r\n\r\nThe glare of the fire enabled us to regain our camp without difficulty,\r\nor otherwise we might have lost ourselves in the gloom of the forest.\r\nThis incident showed us the importance of being constantly on the watch;\r\nfor the bear, if a grizzly, might have picked one of us up before we\r\nwere aware of his vicinity.  After this, during the remainder of my\r\nwatch, I had no inclination to sleep; but the moment Martin relieved me,\r\nI was in the land of dreams, or rather forgetfulness, for neither bears\r\nnor swans, nor any of the events of the previous days, in the slightest\r\ndegree troubled me.\r\n\r\nNext morning Robin's voice--he having taken the last watch--aroused us\r\nat daybreak; and making a hearty breakfast on the remainder of our swan,\r\nwe set to work to continue the repairs of our canoe.  It was a long job,\r\nbut we hoped that it was effectually done.\r\n\r\nSome hours had passed since sunrise, and we could not hope to accomplish\r\nmuch of our voyage before nightfall.\r\n\r\n\"I wish we had some of that bear,\" said Martin.  \"We must try to get\r\nsome fish, or something better, for dinner.  It won't be worth while to\r\ncarry these swans with us; will it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't let us throw away what will keep body and soul together till we\r\nhave procured something better,\" answered Alick, who wisely considered\r\nthat many hours might pass before we could replace what had taken so\r\nmuch trouble to obtain.\r\n\r\nWe put the birds into the canoe, and followed by Bouncer took our seats.\r\nThe repairs on which we had bestowed so much labour were satisfactory,\r\nfor not a drop of water came in.  Plying our paddles, for the wind was\r\nup the stream, and we could not use our sail, we began to make our way\r\ndown it.  The current being moderate did not help us much, and it\r\nappeared as if we should never reach the mouth.  In our eagerness when\r\nchasing the swans we were not aware how far we had gone up.  Of course,\r\nwe kept our guns ready to shoot any animals we might see on the banks;\r\nbut though we caught sight of a few birds among the branches, they were\r\ntoo far off to afford us a fair chance of killing them.\r\n\r\nWe saw no traces, either, of Indian encampments, though from the\r\npleasant character of the country we thought it probable that wood\r\nIndians might have made it their abode.  We had just rounded a point,\r\nand were passing under some trees which overshadowed the water, throwing\r\na dark shade across it, when we saw ahead of us an object moving up\r\nagainst the current.  The darkness prevented us from distinguishing what\r\nit was.\r\n\r\nRobin, who had been talking about the tricks of the redskins, and was,\r\nfrom having lived so long among them, inclined to be suspicious,\r\ndeclared that they were the plumes of Indians who were lying in wait to\r\nseize our canoe as we got near them.\r\n\r\n\"They are more likely to have waited on the shore concealed among the\r\nbushes, and to have shot us with their arrows,\" observed Alick.  \"I\r\ndon't think any Indians would venture to attack us in the water.\"\r\n\r\nStill Robin was not convinced, and Martin was inclined to agree with\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"Be ready, then, to fire if necessary,\" said Alick; \"but not till I tell\r\nyou.  We can easily paddle out of their way, and they'll not venture to\r\nfollow us; though I repeat that I feel nearly sure that those are not\r\nIndians.  We will push quickly on, and if they are Indians, when they\r\nsee that we approach them boldly and have guns ready, they'll keep out\r\nof our way.\"\r\n\r\nSoon after this a gleam of light coming through an opening in the wood\r\nfell on the objects we had been watching, when our apprehensions were\r\ncompletely dissipated; for we saw that they were coloured ducks, so\r\nbusily engaged among a shoal of small fry that they did not observe us.\r\n\r\n\"Paddle on gently, Robin,\" said Alick.--\"Do you, Martin and David, be\r\nready to fire at the birds in the water, and we will do so as soon as\r\nthey rise.\"\r\n\r\nThe current helping us, we rapidly neared the ducks.  Martin and I hit\r\ntwo, and Alick and Robin brought down a brace.  Hearing the report of\r\nour guns, the flock flew towards the wood for shelter.  We soon picked\r\nup those we had shot; but the flock had got too far off to permit of our\r\nkilling any others.  Those we had obtained were fine fat fellows with\r\nrich plumage, and would afford us an ample feast, with some to spare for\r\nBouncer.\r\n\r\nOur success encouraged us to hope that we should not want for provisions\r\nduring our voyage.  We at last got into the main river.  Evening was\r\napproaching, and as we had eaten nothing since breakfast, and a\r\nconvenient spot appearing on the left bank, we could not resist the\r\ntemptation of landing to cook our ducks.\r\n\r\nIt of course took time to collect sticks for our fire.  While Martin and\r\nRobin were doing this, Alick and I prepared the ducks, which had not, it\r\nmust be understood, nearly as much flesh on them as tame ducks, and\r\nwould therefore, after all, not afford an overpoweringly large meal to\r\neach of us, considering that Bouncer was to have his share.\r\n\r\nWe soon saw that by the time the ducks were cooked it would be too late\r\nto proceed on our voyage, and therefore agreed to camp during the night\r\nwhere we were.  While Alick and I were engaged on our task, Robin\r\narrived with a large bundle of wood sufficient to kindle the fire.  We\r\ntherefore at once set the ducks on to roast, hoping that Martin would\r\nsoon come in with a further supply of fuel.  As he did not appear, Robin\r\nand I set off to collect some more, lest our fire should burn out.  We\r\nwere hurrying back when we heard Martin's voice.\r\n\r\nHe had only a small bundle of wood on his shoulders, while he carried\r\nunder his arm a number of deer-horns.\r\n\r\n\"I found these near an old Indian camp,\" he exclaimed, \"and it struck me\r\nat once that we could manufacture out of them some heads for spears,\r\nwith which we may manage to kill some fish.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know what Alick will think about it, but I suspect that it will\r\ntake too long a time,\" I said; \"and where are the handles to be found?\"\r\n\r\n\"As I came along I saw some saplings, which we can soon cut down with\r\nour axe; besides which I found a quantity of deer sinews, which the\r\nIndians must have dropped.  Though it is some time since the Indians\r\nwere at the camp, the sinews are still in good condition.\"\r\n\r\nAlick was better pleased with Martin's idea than I had fancied he would\r\nbe.  Martin indeed was very ingenious, and could turn his hand to\r\nanything, as could Robin.  As soon as we had eaten our ducks, as there\r\nwas still some daylight remaining, Alick and I cut down four thin\r\nsaplings for spear-handles, while our two friends were working away at\r\nthe deer-horns, which they shaped into barbs.\r\n\r\n\"We shall not have time to manufacture more than two,\" said Martin; \"and\r\nthose are as many as we can use, for two must paddle, while the others\r\nstrike the fish.\"\r\n\r\n\"How are we to get the fish to stop and be struck at?\"  I asked.\r\n\r\n\"We must try fishing by night,\" answered Martin.\r\n\r\n\"Still less likely we shall be to see them,\" I observed.\r\n\r\n\"Not if we have a light on board, and I have been thinking about that,\"\r\nhe answered.  \"We must fill our pot with resinous wood, and by placing\r\nit on the bows we shall have the means of attracting the fish.  When\r\nthey come up we must spear them.  I have seen the Indians on the upper\r\nlakes catch fish in this way, and I know that they are caught in the\r\nsame manner in many other countries.\"\r\n\r\nFrom Martin's description we all became eager to try to catch fish in\r\nthe way he spoke of.  We soon found the wood he mentioned, a species of\r\nfir which contained a large amount of resin, and split up into small\r\npieces it emitted a bright light.\r\n\r\nWhile seated on the bank we had observed a number of fish leaping in the\r\nriver, which here formed a bay with little or no current; and we agreed\r\nthat as soon as the spears were ready we would go out and try our luck\r\nthat night.\r\n\r\nAs the deer-horns were hard, it took a long time to fashion even two\r\nspearheads, so that it must have been past ten o'clock when they were\r\nready, though we all worked away diligently by the light of the fire.\r\nAlick proposed lying down and waiting till the following night; but we\r\nwere all so eager to set out that we persuaded him to start at once,\r\nthat we might try the sport for an hour or so, and then land again with\r\nour fish ready to cook for breakfast in the morning.\r\n\r\nWe should have time enough for sleep, as, having to sit in the canoe all\r\nday, we could do very well with less than usual.  All things being ready\r\nwe started.  We still had our two swans, which Alick observed might be\r\nuseful should our spears not answer as well as we hoped.  Martin and I\r\nundertook to use the spears while Alick and Robin paddled.\r\n\r\nAs soon as we had got a short distance from the shore we lighted our\r\nfire, which as it blazed up cast a lurid glare over the waters.  Though\r\nwe looked eagerly for the fish none could we see.  They had either swum\r\naway or were not to be attracted by the bright light.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps there may be more out in the stream,\" said Martin.  \"Let us\r\npaddle slowly down, and ten to one we see some.\"\r\n\r\nAlick consented, and proposed, moreover, that as we had embarked we\r\nmight as well proceed on our voyage, as the light enabled us to see our\r\nway as well as in the daytime, while the air was cooler than when the\r\nhot sun beat down on the stream.  We had gone some distance when Martin\r\nstruck down his spear.\r\n\r\n\"I hit a fish,\" he exclaimed, \"but it got off.  We may have better luck\r\nthe next time.\"\r\n\r\nI shortly afterwards saw another fish, which I succeeded not only in\r\nstriking but in securing, though it fell off the moment I got it into\r\nthe canoe.  It showed us that our spears were not as perfectly barbed or\r\nas sharp as was necessary.  This success encouraged us to continue the\r\nsport, and we went on and on, though we did not succeed in securing any\r\nmore fish.  Our fire, however, had produced an effect we had not\r\nexpected.  As we were passing a low cliff, loud cries of wild-fowl\r\nsaluted our ears.  The birds, roused by the appearance of the light,\r\nflew off from their nests, and came circling around us; so we fired\r\nseveral shot at them, and brought three down.\r\n\r\nThe rest, not aware of what had happened, continued pursuing us; their\r\nnumbers increased from the other denizens of the banks.  Alick, in his\r\neagerness to shoot the birds, was using less caution than before.  I\r\nfancied that I heard the rushing sound of water.\r\n\r\n\"There must be rapids near us,\" I exclaimed.\r\n\r\nJust as I spoke Alick again fired, and two birds fell into the water\r\nahead of us.  Taking his paddle, he urged the canoe forward to pick them\r\nup.  None of us could tell how it was, but all of a sudden we found\r\nourselves whirled onwards by an unseen power.  Though we got the paddles\r\nout, we had lost all control over our canoe.  The next instant, her bow\r\nstriking a rock, she was whirled round, when her stern came in contact\r\nwith a snag also fixed in the crevices of another rock.\r\n\r\n\"Jump out for your lives, lads!\" cried Alick, setting us the example.\r\n\r\nThe water, we found, was rushing over the ledge on to which he stepped.\r\nMartin and I followed, carrying our guns.  Robin sprang after us,\r\ncatching hold of the sail; while Bouncer, acting as a brave sailor does,\r\nwas the last to quit the ship.\r\n\r\nI had just time to leap forward and catch hold of the iron pot when the\r\ncanoe was whirled away down the rapids.  On examining our position we\r\nfound ourselves on a large rock nearly in the middle of the stream,\r\nwhich afforded us a resting-place, but how we were to reach the bank was\r\nthe question.\r\n\r\nWe sat down very disconsolate to discuss the matter.  It did not do just\r\nthen to think too much of the future.  Our first business was to get on\r\nshore where food was to be obtained; though, fortunately, having had a\r\ngood supper we were not hungry.  As far as we could judge in the\r\ndarkness, the way to the left bank was most practicable; but even in\r\nthat direction there were broad places to be passed, across which we\r\nmight be unable to wade.\r\n\r\nWe had gone through many adventures, but this was the most trying and\r\nperhaps the most dangerous.  The rapids below us boiled and foamed, and\r\nran with great force.  Should we lose our footing we might be carried\r\naway and dashed against the rocks.\r\n\r\n\"Though this is not a pleasant place on which to pass the night, I think\r\nwe shall do wisely to remain here till daylight will enable us better to\r\nsee our way,\" observed Alick.\r\n\r\nOur position was too uncomfortable to allow us to sleep; indeed, had we\r\ndone so we should have run the risk of slipping off into the water.  We\r\ntherefore discussed various plans for getting on shore.\r\n\r\n\"If we had but a rope we might do it without danger,\" said Martin, \"and\r\nI think we have materials enough to manufacture one.  The sail cut up\r\nand twisted will form a good length.\"\r\n\r\n\"You shall have my overcoat,\" said Alick.  \"We must try to kill a deer,\r\nthe skin of which will make a covering for me at night.  I can do very\r\nwell without it in the daytime.\"\r\n\r\nI also had a coat, and imitating Alick offered to sacrifice it for the\r\npublic good.  \"A shirt which I have in my knapsack will supply its\r\nplace,\" I observed.\r\n\r\n\"I have a strong linen shirt in mine,\" said Martin.\r\n\r\nRobin had a couple of handkerchiefs, besides which we had the straps of\r\nour knapsacks and pouch-belts.  With these materials we considered that\r\nwe could make a rope sufficiently strong for our purpose.  It required\r\nconsiderable ingenuity to fasten all these together.  The parcel of\r\nsinews which Martin had found were exceedingly useful; indeed, I don't\r\nknow how we could have secured the straps without them.  We had to wait,\r\nhowever, till daylight before we could perform the neater work, though\r\nthere was light sufficient in the open river to enable us to cut up and\r\ntwist some of the articles we had destined for the purpose.  We had thus\r\nmade a pretty strong bit of rope when day broke.\r\n\r\nWe then began to secure the straps together.  To do this we had to make\r\nholes in the ends with the prickers of our knives, through which to pass\r\nthe threads--a long and tedious operation, as, of course, it was of\r\nvital importance that they should be firmly secured: a weak part might\r\nendanger our safety.  As may be supposed, we worked very diligently, for\r\nwe were getting hungry, and had no chance of obtaining food where we\r\nwere.  How long it might be after we reached the shore before we could\r\nfall in with game of some sort it was impossible to say.\r\n\r\nOur spears had been lost, so that even should we see any fish in the\r\nrapids we could not catch them.\r\n\r\nAt last the rope was completed.  It was sufficiently long, we\r\ncalculated, to reach from one side to the other of the broadest passage\r\nwe should have to cross, as there were several rocks which would serve\r\nas resting-places between us and the left or northern bank.\r\n\r\nBefore using it, by Alick's advice we tried every part, hauling with all\r\nour might, two against two.  It was fortunate it did not give way, for\r\nhad it done so we all four might have fallen into the river on opposite\r\nsides of the rock.\r\n\r\n\"Come, that will do,\" said Alick; \"I'll go first, and you three hold on\r\nto the other end.  If I miss my footing, haul me in; but if I succeed,\r\nyou, David, remain behind, and let either Martin or Robin make their way\r\nacross, holding on to the rope.  When they are safe over, you fasten it\r\nround your waist, and we'll haul you after us.\"\r\n\r\nThe plan seemed a good one, with every prospect of success.  The water\r\nwas apparently of no great depth, and did not run with nearly as much\r\nforce on the north side of the rapids as it did on the south, towards\r\nwhich by a bend of the river the principal current was directed; still,\r\nas we looked at the foaming, hissing, roaring waters below us, we saw\r\nthe fearful danger to which we should be exposed should we miss our\r\nfooting and be carried away in them.  Indeed, without a rope, the\r\npassage seemed to be altogether impossible.\r\n\r\nAlick, of course, ran the chief danger, as he had nothing to support\r\nhim, and had, besides, the rope to drag and his rifle to carry.  We\r\nscrambled over to the west side of the rock, or that which looked up the\r\nstream; then Alick fastened the rope round his waist, and offering up a\r\nshort prayer for protection, he stepped carefully into the foaming\r\nwater.  At first it did not reach much above his ankles, but it soon\r\nbegan to rise higher and higher, until it reached his knees; and as we\r\nsaw it foaming round him, we feared every instant that he would be\r\ncarried off his legs.\r\n\r\nThough he stepped directly across the stream he kept looking upwards, so\r\nthat, should he have to swim, he might strike out at once in the right\r\ndirection.  More than half the passage had been accomplished.  There was\r\nample length of rope, which we allowed occasionally to run out as it was\r\nrequired.  Still the water got deeper.\r\n\r\nAlick stopped for a moment, as if hesitating whether he should proceed.\r\nThen again he stepped out, and the water surged up almost to his waist,\r\nas it seemed to us at that distance.\r\n\r\nA cry escaped us.  We thought he had gone, but he recovered himself and\r\nsprang to a higher level.  Again the water reached no higher than his\r\nknees.  He went on with more confidence, till he stood safe on the rock\r\nfor which he was making.\r\n\r\n\"Hold on tightly to the rope,\" he shouted.--\"Robin, you come next.\r\nDon't let go your grasp, though you may find yourself carried off your\r\nlegs.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, ay!\" answered Robin.  \"I'll not do that; the rope is what I'm going\r\nto trust to.\"  And without more ado he plunged in, not walking steadily\r\nas Alick had been compelled to do, but leaping like a dog in shallow\r\nwater, so that he got across in much less time with apparently less\r\nrisk.\r\n\r\nMartin followed his example, and was twice nearly carried off his legs.\r\n\r\nIt was now my turn.  The rope, should it not break, would haul me back\r\nshould I lose my footing; but the danger was that it might break, as it\r\nwould have to bear my weight with the current pressing against it, as\r\nalso that of the articles I carried.\r\n\r\nThere was a piece of rope to spare.  I put the end into Bouncer's mouth,\r\nand patting him on the head told him to hold on and swim after me.  He\r\nunderstood perfectly what was to be done.  I did not for a moment\r\nhesitate, as there was no time to be lost; and springing in, instead of\r\ngoing directly across I waded diagonally up the stream, Bouncer holding\r\ntight on to the rope, and bravely breasting the current.  By this means\r\nI found, as I expected, that I was in shallower water, and was able to\r\nget across almost as fast as the others had done with the aid of the\r\nrope.\r\n\r\nThe next passage we had to make was shorter, but was quite as deep, and\r\nfor a few seconds Alick was in great danger of being carried down the\r\nstream.  Two other watery spaces had still to be crossed; the last\r\nlooked the more dangerous, but Alick got over and stood safely on the\r\nbank.  He then went up the stream some way, when Robin and Martin\r\ncrossed as they had done at the other places.  I followed, with Bouncer\r\ntowing after me, though I had to put no small strain on the rope to\r\nenable myself to get over.\r\n\r\nEvery moment I thought that it would give way, but it held fast, and\r\nmost thankful we were to find ourselves at length safe on the northern\r\nbank of the river.  We had kept our guns and ammunition dry, though of\r\ncourse our lower garments were perfectly wet.\r\n\r\n\"My boys,\" said Alick, \"we have reason every day to be thankful to God\r\nfor His watchful care over us, but especially now we should return\r\nthanks for our preservation, for I tell you we have run a fearful risk\r\nof losing our lives.  We might have been all drowned together when the\r\ncanoe was destroyed, and at any moment in crossing above these rapids we\r\nmight have been carried off our feet and swept down them.\"\r\n\r\nWe all acknowledged the truth of his remarks, and together kneeling down\r\non the grass, we lifted up our voices in a prayer of thanksgiving.  We\r\nthen hurried away to collect wood for a fire, that we might dry our\r\ndrenched clothes and consider what was next to be done.\r\n\r\n\"One thing is very clear,\" observed Alick, as we sat round the fire.\r\n\"We have no food, and being hungry the sooner we can get some the\r\nbetter.  Our way is down the stream, and we must set off as soon as\r\npossible in that direction.\"\r\n\r\nThe sun and wind assisted the fire in drying our clothes, and we were\r\nsoon ready to commence our journey.  We kept our eyes about us as we\r\nwent on, on the chance of any birds or animals appearing.  Hunger, it is\r\ntruly said, makes keen sportsmen, and we should not have let a mouse\r\nescape us if we had seen one.  We kept close to the bank, and for a mile\r\nor more the rapids continued, though we saw that on the opposite side a\r\ncanoe might descend without danger.  Alick was constantly examining the\r\nbank.  \"I thought so,\" he exclaimed, when we had got about half a mile\r\nbelow the rapid.  Running forward he picked up three of our paddles and\r\none of the spears.  The others could not be far off, unless they had\r\nstruck in the crevice of a rock.  This, perhaps, they had done, for we\r\ncould not find them.\r\n\r\nMartin immediately took possession of the spear.\r\n\r\n\"I may still have a chance of killing a fish, if we come to any deep\r\nlittle bay or bend of the river, where some are likely to be at rest,\"\r\nhe observed.\r\n\r\nIt was getting late, and unless we could kill something soon we should\r\nhave to go supperless to bed.\r\n\r\n\"Hillo!  I see something,\" cried Robin, and rushing forward he held up\r\none of the despised swans.\r\n\r\nThe sight at all events gave pleasure to Bouncer, who began barking and\r\nleaping round it.\r\n\r\n\"You shall have some directly, old fellow,\" cried Robin.\r\n\r\nAs we saw a suitable spot for encamping a little distance from the bank,\r\nwe agreed to stop for the night.  The wind blowing somewhat colder than\r\nusual, a wigwam, or at all events a lean-to, was considered advisable.\r\nMartin and I set to work to collect the necessary materials, while Alick\r\nand Robin lighted the fire and spitted the swan for cooking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER NINE.\r\n\r\nWOOD-PIGEONS AND SQUIRREL FOR SUPPER--BEAR'S MEAT--CANOE-BUILDING--\r\nGRASSHOPPERS--SHE FLOATS EVEN--ROW, BROTHERS, ROW!--THE THUNDERSTORM--\r\nOUR NARROW ESCAPE--OUR HUT--DEER--THE BUCK IS DEAD--VENISON IN PLENTY--\r\nIMPROVIDENCE OF THE INDIANS--BREAKERS AHEAD.\r\n\r\nI cannot describe our adventures from day to day as I have been lately\r\ndoing.\r\n\r\nWhile eating our somewhat unsavoury swan, we discussed how we should\r\nnext proceed.  We knew but little of the bank of the river on which we\r\nfound ourselves, but at all events we should have a long journey on foot\r\nbefore us, and we did not fancy the tramp through the woods.\r\n\r\n\"But if we do not go on foot how are we ever to get to Fort Ross?\"\r\nexclaimed Robin.  \"We can scarcely expect to find another canoe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, of course we must build one,\" said Martin.  \"I have never made one\r\nentirely myself, but I have seen them built frequently, and have helped\r\nsometimes, and I am very sure that we all together could manage to\r\nconstruct one which will carry us safely down the river.\"\r\n\r\nThere were no dissentient voices.  Martin warned us that it would take\r\nsome time.  We should have to shape out all the ribs, and search for\r\nbirch trees of sufficient girth to afford large sheets of bark.  The\r\nchief object for consideration was, that it would take us almost as long\r\nto build a canoe as to travel to Fort Ross, but then we should be saved\r\nthe fatigue and dangers of the journey, and we should be more likely to\r\nfall in with any of the people whom our friends at the fort might have\r\ndispatched to look for us, in the hopes that we had escaped from the\r\nmassacre at Fort Black.  Another great reason for proceeding by water\r\nwas the state of our shoes: getting so often wet and dry they had become\r\ncompletely rotten.  Alick's were falling off his feet; mine were in a\r\nvery little better condition; Martin had thrown his away as useless, and\r\nRobin had done the same, but as he had so long gone without shoes, his\r\nfeet were hardened, and he cared very little about the matter.\r\n\r\nWhile the weather was warm it was not of much consequence, but we might\r\nexpect frost soon to set in, and unless we could manufacture some\r\nmoccasins we should suffer greatly.  If we could kill a deer we might\r\nsupply ourselves, but hitherto we had seen none along the banks of the\r\nriver; still we hoped to fall in with some, as both skins and meat would\r\nbe very acceptable.\r\n\r\n\"Then I consider that the best thing we can do is to camp in an eligible\r\nspot, and commence building a canoe without delay,\" said Alick.\r\n\r\nWe all agreed with him.\r\n\r\n\"I have no doubt about being able to do it,\" said Martin; \"but we must\r\nfix on some place where the white birch trees are abundant, that we may\r\nhave a good selection of bark.  Much depends on its perfect condition,\r\nand many of the trees we have passed are of insufficient size or have\r\nholes in the bark, which would render them useless for our purpose.\"\r\n\r\nWe trudged on therefore, eagerly looking out for a spot which would\r\nanswer all our requirements.  Before long we found one with some cedar\r\ntrees in the neighbourhood, and some young spruce firs not far off.  On\r\na hillside a little way from the river grew a number of pines; the pitch\r\nwhich exuded from them we wanted for covering the seams.  The wood of\r\nthe cedar was required for forming the frame of the canoe, while the\r\nslender and flexible roots of the young spruce trees would afford us\r\nwhat is called \"wattap\"--threads for sewing the bark on to the gunwale\r\nand securing it to the ribs.\r\n\r\n\"As we shall be some days building our canoe, we may as well put up a\r\nhut and make ourselves comfortable in the meantime,\" observed Martin.\r\n\"It won't take long to do that, and should a storm come on we should\r\nrequire shelter.\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall want something of still more consequence,\" observed Alick.\r\n\"We have no food, and you fellows will soon be crying out for it.  While\r\nMartin and David get the camp ready, light a fire, cut some poles for a\r\nwigwam, and collect some rough sheets of bark to cover it with, Robin\r\nand I will go in search of game.  We shall find something or other\r\nbefore dark, if we keep our eyes open and our wits awake, and I shall\r\nnot feel inclined to return without food, so take care to have a good\r\nfire burning to roast it by.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I say, don't go off with the axe,\" exclaimed Martin, as Alick was\r\nwalking away with it stuck in his belt.  \"We cannot cut down the poles\r\nwithout it, or strip off the bark from the trees.\"\r\n\r\nAlick handed the axe to Martin, who, giving a flourish with it,\r\nobserved, \"We shall have work enough for this fellow to do, but I must\r\ntake care to keep its edge sharp.\"\r\n\r\nAlick and Robin set off with their guns, while Martin and I commenced\r\nthe work we had undertaken.  We at first collected sticks and had a fire\r\nblazing in an open spot from which we had cleared off all the grass for\r\nfear of its igniting the surrounding herbage and producing a\r\nconflagration--no unusual occurrence in the woods.  The feeling of\r\nhunger made us very active, for we hoped that Alick and Robin would soon\r\nreturn with some game.  As they did not appear, we cut down a number of\r\npoles and fixed them up on a spot a little distance from the river,\r\ntowards which the ground gradually sloped down.  Having secured all\r\ntogether at the top, the framework of our hut was complete.\r\n\r\nWe had then to obtain some slabs of birch-bark.  Several lay on the\r\nground stripped off by the wind.  Many of these we found lying at the\r\nfoot of the trees, and though unfitted for building a canoe, they were\r\nvery well suited for our present purpose.  We worked so diligently that\r\nwe completely covered our wigwam.  We now began to look out anxiously\r\nfor the return of our companions, our hunger reminding us that it was\r\nhigh time for them to be back.  While we were working we had not thought\r\nso much about it.  I had thrown myself down on the grass, having\r\nfinished my labours.\r\n\r\n\"Come!\" said Martin, who was always very active; \"if game is not brought\r\nto us, I vote we go in search of it,\" and seizing his gun he made his\r\nway amid the trees.\r\n\r\nI followed him.  Presently I heard him fire, and directly afterwards I\r\ncaught sight of a squirrel on a high branch.  Taking good aim, I brought\r\nit down, and was soon joined by Martin, who had shot a couple of\r\nwood-pigeons.  We hurried back to the camp, stripped the birds of their\r\nfeathers, skinned the squirrel, and soon had them roasting before the\r\nfire.\r\n\r\n\"Our friends will be well pleased not to have to wait for their supper,\"\r\nsaid Martin, as he quickly turned round the wood-pigeons on the spit.\r\n\r\nThey were soon cooked, and unable to resist the gnawings of hunger we\r\ndivided one of them and ate it up.  We then attacked the squirrel, but\r\nrestraining our appetites, reserved half for Alick and Robin, for we\r\nthought it possible that they might after all return without any game.\r\nHaving satisfied our hunger, we thought more seriously about them.  What\r\ncould have happened to delay them?\r\n\r\nAt last I began to fear that some accident must have befallen them.  It\r\nwas getting dusk.  Should darkness overtake them, they would be unable\r\nto find their way through the woods.  We piled up more wood on the fire,\r\nand went some way from it in the direction we expected they would come,\r\nshouting loudly at the top of our voices to attract their attention.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot fancy that they have lost themselves,\" observed Martin.\r\n\"Robin, with his Indian training, would find his way anywhere; and Alick\r\nis not likely to have gone wrong, especially with the river to guide\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\nStill I grew more and more anxious, and pictured to myself all sorts of\r\naccidents.\r\n\r\n\"We should never think of the worst till it happens,\" observed Martin.\r\n\"They were probably tempted to go farther than they intended.  Perhaps\r\nwe shall see them come back loaded with venison or a few dozen wild\r\nducks, which will supply our larder for many days to come.  Hark!  I\r\nthink I hear a shout.  Now!\" and we again shouted out.  A reply\r\nimmediately came through the trees.\r\n\r\n\"That's Alick's voice, and I heard Robin's shriller treble,\" said\r\nMartin.  \"They will be here anon, and will be highly delighted to sit\r\ndown and munch the remainder of the squirrel and the wood-pigeon.\"\r\n\r\nWe hurried forward to meet our friends, as far as the light of the fire\r\nwould enable us to see our way, and presently they both appeared,\r\ncarrying huge masses of something on their backs.\r\n\r\n\"We have got food enough to last us till we reach Fort Ross,\" exclaimed\r\nAlick, as he limped along, and I observed that he had lost both his\r\nshoes.  \"It might have cost us dear, though.  Robin was nearly getting\r\nan ugly grip.  See! we have killed a bear, and brought as much of the\r\nmeat as we could carry, and a part of the skin to form moccasins till we\r\ncan kill some deer, which will afford us more comfortable covering for\r\nour feet.\"\r\n\r\nWe relieved them of their loads, and were soon seated round the fire,\r\nBouncer lying down complacently watching us, while they discussed the\r\nprovisions we had cooked; he, having devoured as much of the bear as he\r\ncould manage, was independent of other food.  Alick then told us that\r\nthey had come suddenly on Bruin, who was on the point of seizing Robin\r\nwhen he had shot at it, but had missed; the bear, instead of pursuing\r\nthem, frightened by the report of the gun, had taken to flight, when\r\nthey followed and finally killed it.  In their chase, while passing over\r\na piece of boggy ground, he had lost his shoes.  The chase and the\r\nreturn to camp had occupied a considerable amount of time.\r\n\r\n\"All's well that ends well,\" exclaimed Martin, \"and now I propose that\r\nwe smoke some of the bear's flesh.\"\r\n\r\nTo this we all agreed, and thus employed ourselves till we turned in at\r\nnight.\r\n\r\n\"Up, up,\" cried Martin the next morning at daybreak.  \"We must turn to\r\nwithout loss of time, and begin building our canoe.  We must first cut\r\nout the ribs, which will be the longest part of the operation, and those\r\nwho like can accompany me to the cedar wood.\"\r\n\r\nWe all did so; and Martin, selecting some young trees, cut them down;\r\nthen, with his axe, he chopped them into lengths.  This done, we all\r\nworked away with our knives to form them into thin strips.  The wood is\r\nremarkably tough, hard, and white, and can be bent into any form.  We\r\nwere employed all day in this work, and it was not till the next that we\r\nhad a sufficient quantity of strips to commence forming the frame.\r\n\r\nTo form the gunwale we had to fasten a number together.  The gunwale was\r\nkept apart by slender bars of the same wood, while the ribs were bent\r\ninto the required shape, which they easily retained.  There was no keel,\r\nand the bottom was nearly flat.  The third bar was broader than the\r\nrest, and in it we cut a hole for stepping the mast, though unless with\r\na very light and perfectly favourable wind we should be unable to carry\r\nsail.\r\n\r\nIt took us several days to put the framework together.  We had now to\r\ncut the bark from the white birch trees.  To do this we formed two\r\ncircles round a tree, about five or six feet apart, and then cut a\r\nperpendicular notch down from one to the other; next, putting pieces of\r\nwood under the bark at the notches, we without difficulty pulled it off.\r\n\r\nMartin having before taken his measurements, the bark exactly fitted the\r\ncentre part of the canoe, being also very nearly of the required shape.\r\nWe now sewed it on with the wattap.  This was a long operation, as every\r\nhole had to be carefully bored.  Another piece of somewhat less width\r\nformed the bows, easily conforming itself to the required shape.  A\r\nsingle thickness of bark formed the sides, but at the bottom we placed\r\nsome long strips to serve as bottom-boards, which rested on the ribs.\r\n\r\nThe bark had to be sewn on also to all the ribs, though this did not\r\nrequire the same number of stitches as used at the gunwale.  We all\r\nworked away at it till some progress had been made, when Robin took\r\ncharge of the gum-pot, he having previously concocted a quantity of\r\npitch from the pine trees.  This had to be thickened by boiling, and the\r\njoinings were luted with it, thus rendering the canoe perfectly\r\nwater-tight.\r\n\r\nThe seats were formed by suspending strips of bark with cords from the\r\ngunwales in such a manner that they did not press against the sides of\r\nthe canoe.  Our canoe was only about twelve feet long, but was\r\nsufficiently large to carry us four.  I have seen such canoes\r\nthirty-five feet in length, and six feet in width at the widest part,\r\ntapering gradually towards the bow and stern, which are brought to a\r\nwedge-like point, and turned over from the extremities towards the\r\ncentre so as to resemble, in some degree, the head of a violin.\r\n\r\nThese large canoes are calculated to carry sixty packages of skins\r\nweighing ninety pounds each, and provisions amounting to one thousand\r\npounds' weight.  They are paddled by eight men, each of whom has a bag\r\nweighing forty pounds.\r\n\r\nEvery canoe also carries a quantity of bark, wattap, gum, and pine for\r\nheating the gum, an axe, and some small articles necessary for repairing\r\nher.  The weight altogether is probably not under four tons.  The eight\r\nmen can paddle her across a lake, in calm weather, at the rate of about\r\nfour miles an hour; and four can carry her across portages.  Altogether,\r\nfor making voyages in this region, no vessel has been constructed in any\r\nway to equal the birch-bark canoe, such as I have described.  Ours was\r\nvery different, being much smaller; and the work, though pretty strong,\r\nwas not as neat as that performed by Indians.\r\n\r\nRobin, who was fond of quizzing--a trick he had learned from the\r\nredskins--declared that she would prove lopsided, at which Martin, her\r\narchitect, was very indignant.\r\n\r\n\"She'll swim as straight and steady as a duck,\" he answered.\r\n\r\n\"We shall see,\" cried Robin; \"the proof of the pudding will be in the\r\neating.  However, if she does float a little crooked she'll manage to\r\nget to the end of her voyage somehow or other, and we can lay her up at\r\nFort Ross as a specimen of our ingenuity.\"\r\n\r\nWhile building our canoe, one or two of us were compelled to go out in\r\nsearch of game, as it was necessary to dry the bear's flesh as provision\r\nfor our voyage, and we preferred fresh meat.  We generally returned with\r\ntwo or three wood-pigeons or other birds.\r\n\r\nJust before the completion of the canoe, I accompanied Alick on an\r\nexcursion which we intended should be longer than usual.  We found the\r\nforest extending not more than a mile from the bank of the river, after\r\nwhich the country was open, with grassy land and hollows which had once\r\nbeen the beds of ponds.  Here the grass grew especially long.\r\n\r\nWe had not long started when I observed that the horizon wore an\r\nunearthly ashen hue, and it struck me at once that we were about to have\r\na storm.  Presently it seemed as if the whole air was filled with light\r\nsilvery clouds, and what looked at first like flakes of snow falling,\r\nwhich we saw as they approached nearer to be numberless large insects\r\nwith wings.  They were, indeed, grasshoppers, as they are called in the\r\nNorth-West Territory, though they are really locusts.  The number in the\r\nair in a short time became so great that at intervals they perceptibly\r\nlessened the light of the sun.  I had seen them before in much smaller\r\nquantities; and I at once knew what they were.  That I might watch them\r\nmore conveniently, I threw myself on my back.  When looking upwards, as\r\nnear to the sun as the light would permit, I saw the sky continually\r\nchange colour from blue to silvery white, ashy grey, and lead colour--\r\naccording to the density of the masses of insects.  Opposite to the sun,\r\nthe prevailing hue was a silvery white, perceptibly flashing.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion the whole heavens towards the south-east and west\r\nappeared to irradiate a soft grey-tinted light with a quivering motion.\r\nAs the day was calm, the hum produced by the vibration of so many\r\nmillions of wings was quite indescribable, and was more like what people\r\ncall a ringing in one's ears than any other sound that I can think of.\r\n\r\nStrange as it may seem, there was something peculiarly awe-producing to\r\nthe mind as we watched these countless creatures, as it reminded us of\r\nthose scourges sent by God on the land of Egypt as a punishment to its\r\ninhabitants.\r\n\r\nAt first they took short flights, but as the day increased cloud after\r\ncloud rose from the prairie, and pursued their way in the direction of\r\nthe wind.  As the day advanced, they settled round us in countless\r\nmultitudes, clinging to the leaves of shrubs and grass to rest after\r\ntheir long flight.  The whole district where they had settled wore a\r\ncurious appearance, for they had cut the grass uniformly to one inch\r\nfrom the ground.\r\n\r\nThe surface was covered with their small round grey exuvia.  Had they\r\npassed over any cultivated ground, as they do occasionally, the entire\r\ncrops of the farms would have been destroyed.  They leave nothing green\r\nbehind them, and devour even such things as woollen garments, skins, and\r\nleather, with the most astonishing rapidity.  Though they fly very high\r\nin the air when they are making their journeys, they pitch usually on\r\nthe ground, not touching the forests, or one could easily conceive that\r\nthey would in the course of a year or two strip the trees of their\r\nleaves, and leave them with a thoroughly wintry aspect.\r\n\r\nAs, owing to the grasshoppers, we did not expect to obtain any game in\r\nthe open country, we returned to the wood, and were fortunate in killing\r\na number of wood-pigeons.\r\n\r\nOn our arrival at the camp, Martin and Robin shouted out to us that the\r\ncanoe was finished, and only required to have the seams gummed.  This\r\ntask was soon accomplished; and as we were in a hurry to try the canoe,\r\nAlick and I, lifting her up with the greatest ease, carried her down to\r\nthe bank.  Without hesitation we stepped in and placed her on the water,\r\nwhen she floated with perfect evenness.\r\n\r\n\"Hurrah!\" exclaimed Martin, who stood on the bank, throwing up his cap\r\nin his delight at the triumphant success of his undertaking; \"I knew\r\nshe'd do!  I knew she'd do!\"\r\n\r\nBouncer, who had followed us down, apparently as much interested as any\r\none, leaped up on his hind legs, barking loudly; while Robin, who had\r\nremained at the fire attending to the gum-pot, that we might stop any\r\nleaks which were discovered, echoed our shouts.  We had indeed reason to\r\ncongratulate ourselves, for though the canoe was not equal to the one we\r\nhad lost, yet it would answer our purpose, and convey us safely, we\r\nhoped, to our destination.  As it was too late to start that day, we\r\nlifted her up again, and employed ourselves in finishing off two fresh\r\npaddles, in lieu of those which had been lost.\r\n\r\nWe were very merry that evening, as it appeared to us that our\r\ndifficulties were well-nigh over.  We had meat enough to last us for\r\nsome days, and we might reasonably expect to obtain as much as we could\r\nwant on the voyage by landing and spending a day or part of a day in\r\nhunting; still we were not altogether free from care.  Martin was\r\nexcessively anxious about his parents.  He could not avoid recollecting\r\nthe bad disposition shown by the Indians; and though his father and\r\nmother might not have been molested, or might have managed to escape,\r\nthere was a fearful possibility of their having been attacked and\r\nmurdered.\r\n\r\nWe were still also doubtful whether Sandy and Pat had got away in safety\r\nfrom the fort, though we hoped that they had, and had arrived safely at\r\nFort Ross.  If so, we might, by keeping a lookout on the right bank of\r\nthe river, see any expedition which, we felt sure, would be sent up to\r\nrestore Fort Black.\r\n\r\nHaving breakfasted, we again launched our canoe, but we found on putting\r\nher into the water that she leaked in two or three places, where the gum\r\nhad been knocked off.  We had to haul her up again, light our fire, and\r\nheat some more gum to stop the leaks.  This occupied us for some time,\r\nbut at length we were fairly under way; and singing \"Row, brothers,\r\nrow,\" we began paddling down the stream.\r\n\r\nWe agreed not to attempt shooting any rapids we might meet with, but\r\nrather to land and make a portage with our canoe.  Two of us could carry\r\nher on our shoulders without difficulty, and, as Robin remarked, she\r\nweighed scarcely a feather when four of us lifted her.  Though we\r\nintended camping on the left bank, we kept over to the right side, that\r\nwe might have a better chance of seeing any party travelling towards\r\nFort Black.\r\n\r\nThe morning had been fine, and we expected to be able to continue on all\r\nday; but before noon clouds gathered in the sky, from which a vivid\r\nflash of lightning darted towards us, followed by a tremendous peal of\r\nthunder; then came in quick succession another and another flash, with\r\ndeafening peals.  The wind began to blow up the river, and its hitherto\r\ncalm surface was broken into angry waves.  Down rushed the rain, half\r\nfilling our canoe.\r\n\r\n\"We must make for the shore, lads!\" exclaimed Alick, as a heavy sea\r\nbroke over our bows.  \"Paddle, lads, for your lives!  This is no joke,\"\r\nhe added; and he had good reason for saying what he did, for our light\r\nbark was tossed about in a way which rendered it difficult to steer her.\r\n\r\nWe all energetically worked at our paddles.  We had some way to go.  The\r\nwind increased, the thunder roared, and the lightning flashed faster\r\nthan ever.\r\n\r\nAlick kept the canoe with her head partly up the stream, so that we\r\ncrossed diagonally, or the canoe would have been upset, as the\r\nincreasing waves rolled against her.  At length the northern bank was\r\nreached, but we had still the difficulty of landing.  The waves were\r\nwashing against it with considerable force, and should our canoe be\r\ndriven against any projecting branches, a dangerous rent might be made\r\nin it in a moment, and before we could get safely on shore we might be\r\ncarried away by the current.  We had therefore to look out for some bay\r\nor creek up which we could run, so as to be sheltered from the waves.\r\n\r\nThe wind blew now rather up the river than across it, and enabled us to\r\nstem the current.  We had gone some little distance when we saw the\r\nplace we were seeking.\r\n\r\n\"Look out, and see that there are no snags or branches ahead of us,\"\r\ncried Alick to Robin, who had the bow paddle.  \"If you can find a clear\r\nspace, we will run the canoe alongside the bank.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is a spot that will do,\" answered Robin; \"and I'll jump on shore\r\nand hold her while you get out.\"\r\n\r\nGently paddling the canoe, the next moment we got her up to the bank and\r\nstepped on shore in safety.  We then hauled her up, but we were not free\r\nof danger.  Tall trees surrounded the place, their tops waving to and\r\nfro and bending to the gale.  Every now and then fragments of branches\r\nwere torn off and carried to a distance.  There was a risk of one of\r\nthem falling on us, or on the canoe, and crushing her; but it was\r\nimpossible to shift our position, so we had to make the best of it and\r\npray that we might be preserved.\r\n\r\nWe at first ran for shelter under one of the tall trees, and Robin\r\nproposed that we should build a hut against it, with a fire in front at\r\nwhich we might dry our wet clothes.\r\n\r\n\"That would do very well, if it were not for the lightning,\" observed\r\nAlick.  \"At any moment that tree might be struck, and we, if close to\r\nthe trunk, might all be killed or severely injured.\"\r\n\r\nAs he said this, Robin and I, who were leaning against it, sprang out\r\ninto the open.  The next instant a loud report was heard; a branch came\r\ncrashing down, and the stout tree appeared riven to the very roots!\r\nHappily the branch fell on one side.\r\n\r\n\"We may thank Providence that we have all escaped,\" said Alick.  \"It\r\nwon't do to be standing out here exposed to the rain.  The sooner we can\r\nget up a hut of some sort the better.\"\r\n\r\nThe branch which had fallen afforded us the framework of a hut.  Alick,\r\ntaking the axe, cut off as many pieces as we required, pointing them so\r\nthat we could run them deep into the earth.  A little way off there was\r\nan abundance of bark, which, seizing, we quickly dragged up to the spot.\r\n\r\nHurrying out of the wood again as fast as we could, in a short time we\r\nhad a roughly-formed hut erected, sufficient to turn off the rain.  The\r\nspot was almost completely sheltered from the wind, so that we had no\r\nfear about lighting a fire.  At the same time the wood was already so\r\nwet that it cost us some trouble to ignite it.  We succeeded at last,\r\nand, drawing it close up to the hut, it afforded us warmth and enabled\r\nus to dry our wet clothes.\r\n\r\nThe rain soon ceased, but the wind held and whistled in the branches.\r\nThe thunder roared, and flashes of lightning illumined the dark sky.  We\r\nhad reason to be thankful that we were so far protected, and hoped that\r\nwe might escape any other falling branches or the effects of the\r\nlightning.  Had we ventured to land in a more exposed situation, our\r\ncanoe might at any moment have been blown off into the river, while we\r\ncould neither have put up a hut nor have lighted a fire.\r\n\r\nWe sat on hour after hour, hoping that the storm would cease.  The\r\nground was too damp to allow us to lie down with any prospect of\r\ncomfort; but we had some pieces of bark which afforded us seats, and had\r\nwe had time to get larger pieces we might have rested with more comfort.\r\n\r\nThus the night passed away, but when daylight returned the storm was\r\nblowing with as much fury as before.  Though we saw masses of leaves and\r\nbranches flying over our heads, none of the latter fell into our\r\nsheltered little nook.  We agreed that it would be wise to remain where\r\nwe were.\r\n\r\nAlick employed himself, with Martin's assistance, in making a pair of\r\nmoccasins, which, though rough and ugly, were calculated to protect his\r\nfeet from the thorns and splinters he might step upon in the forest.  I\r\nmended my shoes, patching them with small pieces of bearskin; but they\r\nwould not have served for a long walk.  Robin improved one of the\r\npaddles, which had been roughly cut out at first.\r\n\r\nThus we passed the greater part of the morning seated before our fire,\r\nexcept when we were cooking and eating some bear's flesh to satisfy our\r\nhunger.\r\n\r\nWe had formed also two lookout holes at the back of our hut, through\r\nwhich we could watch should any deer or other animals come near, which\r\nwe thought it possible they might do for the sake of the shelter it\r\nafforded.  Robin was continually jumping up to take a look out; but in\r\nthat respect we were disappointed.\r\n\r\nSoon after noon the wind began to fall, as we knew by the decrease of\r\nits sound among the trees and the lessened agitation of the boughs\r\noverhead.\r\n\r\n\"Come, boys, we may make a few miles good this evening,\" exclaimed\r\nAlick, jumping up.  \"If we find the river still too rough, we can but\r\nput back and spend the night here; but I suspect that in a short time\r\nthe wind will drop altogether, and we shall be able to paddle on till\r\ndark.  We are sure to find some place or other where we can land to camp\r\nfor the night.\"\r\n\r\nWe accordingly lost no time in lifting our canoe into the water and\r\ngetting on board.  Bouncer, observing the careful way in which we\r\nstepped into our canoe, imitated our example, his sagacity showing him\r\nthat if he were to leap on the gunwale he might upset her.\r\n\r\nOnce more we shoved off, and going down the creek were soon in the open\r\nriver.  By this time it was almost calm, and the water was perfectly\r\nsmooth.\r\n\r\nWe paddled on at a quick rate, the river being free of obstructions of\r\nany sort, while at the same time we kept a lookout on both sides for the\r\nappearance of either friends or foes, or of any game.\r\n\r\nThe air after the storm was unusually pleasant, and our spirits rose.\r\nThe banks on either side were wooded, and prevented us from seeing to\r\nany distance beyond them.  Here and there, however, grassy points ran\r\nout into the stream, on which it was possible that deer might be found\r\nfeeding, while in little bays and indentations of the banks tall reeds\r\ngrew, likely to afford shelter to wild-fowl.\r\n\r\nWe were just about to round one of these points when a duck flying up\r\ndirected its course across the river.  Putting in my paddle, I seized my\r\ngun, and was on the point of firing at it when Alick exclaimed, \"Hold\r\nfast! see out there;\" and as I looked ahead, I observed on a low, grassy\r\npoint a herd of five or six deer, which had come down to the river to\r\ndrink.  Some of them, catching sight of the canoe, looked up and stood\r\ncuriously watching us.  Our great object was now to approach without\r\nfrightening them.\r\n\r\n\"Keep silence, all of you,\" whispered Alick.  \"Paddle cautiously on.\r\nGet ready your guns, so as to fire when I tell you.\"\r\n\r\nWe did as he bade us.\r\n\r\n\"We must have one of those fellows, at all events, and two if we can.\r\nIt will be provoking to lose them altogether,\" said Alick.\r\n\r\nHe steered first directly towards the opposite side of the stream, so as\r\nnot to alarm the deer sooner than was necessary; then altering the\r\ncourse of the canoe, we made directly for the point where the animals\r\nwere standing, their curiosity still inducing them to remain watching\r\nus.  We had got almost within shot when they took the alarm, and turning\r\nround retreated into the wood.\r\n\r\nExclamations of disappointment escaped from all of us, for we thought\r\nthat we should see no more of them.\r\n\r\n\"Don't think they are lost; we may still have them,\" cried Alick.\r\n\"Paddle away as hard as you can go, and we'll land and give chase.  We\r\nmay get round them and drive them back towards the water.\"\r\n\r\nInstead of steering for the point where the deer had been standing, he\r\ndirected the course of the canoe higher up the river, and as we neared\r\nthe bank he cried out, \"David, you and Martin remain on board, and Robin\r\nand I will make our way through the wood, and endeavour to turn the\r\ndeer.\"\r\n\r\nAs he said this, he tried the depth of the water, and finding that it\r\nwas shallow, and the bottom hard, he stepped out, followed by Robin and\r\nBouncer, when, soon getting on shore, all three hurried off through the\r\nwood, which was there considerably open.\r\n\r\nWe watched them making their way amid the trees till they were lost to\r\nsight.  I feared that there was little chance of their driving back the\r\ndeer; still Martin and I kept a lookout along the shore, on the\r\npossibility of the animals returning, either driven by Alick and Robin,\r\nor, supposing all danger to have passed, to finish their evening's\r\ndraught.\r\n\r\nSeveral wild-fowl got up and went flying across the stream, some within\r\nshot; but we were afraid of firing, lest we should alarm the nobler\r\ngame.  We kept our paddles ready to urge the canoe in any direction\r\nwhich might be necessary.\r\n\r\nOur patience was somewhat tried.  It was possible, however, that Alick\r\nand Robin might get near enough to the deer to shoot one of them, and we\r\nlistened eagerly for the report of their guns.  We waited and waited,\r\nwhen we saw some way down the stream a magnificent buck burst forth from\r\namid the trees and rush towards the water.  Without hesitating a moment\r\nhe plunged in and began to swim towards the opposite bank.\r\n\r\n\"Paddle away,\" I cried out to Martin.  \"We may have him before he\r\nlands.\"\r\n\r\nWe did paddle, with might and main, feeling almost sure of the prize;\r\nbut the deer swam rapidly, and the current, which he did not attempt to\r\nstem, carried him down.  It was, however, impelling our canoe, so that\r\nmade no difference.  As we advanced, we saw a low island of some extent\r\nabout two-thirds of the way across the river.  The deer was making for\r\nit.  Should he land he would gain considerably on us.\r\n\r\nMartin proposed that we should steer for the southern side, so as to\r\nintercept him.  We were close to the western end of the island, on which\r\nthe deer was about to land, when I thought that I could hit him.  I\r\nfired.  My bullet took effect--of that I was sure; but the deer still\r\ncontinued his course.  Martin now steered the canoe as we had proposed,\r\nand we saw the deer land and begin to make his way across the island.\r\n\r\nIt was evident, however, that my shot had injured him, for he moved\r\nslowly, and by exerting ourselves to the utmost we were soon able again\r\nto get him within range.  He stopped and gazed at us, apparently not\r\nexpecting to see us again in front of him.  Instead of taking to the\r\nwater he moved on towards the east end of the island.  Again he stopped,\r\nfacing us, when raising my rifle I sent a shot directly at his breast.\r\n\r\nLifting up his head, and vainly endeavouring to recover himself, he\r\nslowly sank down on his knees, and the next instant rolled over dead.\r\n\r\nMartin and I, uttering a shout of triumph, paddled towards the shore.\r\n\r\n\"Shall we cut him up at once, or go back and take Alick and Robin on\r\nboard, and then return for the purpose?\" asked Martin.\r\n\r\n\"It may probably be some time before they get back to the bank,\" I\r\nanswered; \"and I think it would be best to cut up the deer, and then we\r\nshall astonish them with the result of our exploit.\"\r\n\r\nOf course we felt not a little proud of our success.  We accordingly\r\nlanded, and set to work in a scientific manner--first skinning the deer,\r\nand then by means of our axe and long knives cutting it up into pieces.\r\nWe took only the best portions, with bits for Bouncer's share, leaving\r\nthe rest of the carcass with the head, excepting the tongue and the\r\nantlers, which might be useful for manufacturing spears and other\r\narticles.\r\n\r\nWe extricated also some of the sinews, which we were sure to want.\r\n\r\nHaving loaded our canoe, we shoved off and began to paddle back towards\r\nthe place where Alick and Robin had landed, looking out for them, in\r\ncase they should appear in any other part of the bank.  We found it a\r\nvery difficult matter, however, to get up the stream.  When we went in\r\nchase of the deer we had the current with us, and the canoe was light.\r\nNow we had a cargo on board.  Though we exerted ourselves to the utmost,\r\nwe made but slow progress, till Martin proposed that we should pull up\r\nnear the right bank, where the current appeared to run with less\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\nNeither of our companions appearing, it did not seem that we need be in\r\nany great hurry until we observed that the sun had sunk low, and that,\r\nbefore long, darkness would come on; still, as we were doing our best,\r\nwe could do no more.  We at last got up some way above the spot where we\r\nhad seen the deer, and after relaxing our efforts for a minute or two to\r\nregain strength, we directed the canoe straight across the stream.  We\r\nhoped, as we drew near the left bank, that Alick and Robin would make\r\ntheir appearance, and we began to be somewhat anxious at not seeing\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\"They were probably induced to follow the deer farther than they\r\nintended,\" observed Martin, \"and perhaps, hearing our shots, may have\r\ngone down the river; and if so, we might have saved ourselves our\r\nfatiguing paddle.\"\r\n\r\nOn looking along the bank, however, as we could nowhere see them we\r\nfinally paddled in for the shore, and very glad we were to reach a spot\r\nwhere we could rest.  Throwing the painter round the branch of a tree\r\nwhich projected over the water, we hung on to it to wait for our\r\ncompanions' return.  We shouted to them to attract their attention, but\r\nno answer came, and we were unwilling to expend a charge of powder by\r\nfiring a signal, as our stock was limited, and it was necessary to\r\nhusband it as much as possible.\r\n\r\nThe shades of evening were already extending across the river, the\r\nbright reflection from the clouds gradually giving place to a uniform\r\ngrey tint, which soon spread over the whole surface.  Martin proposed\r\nthat we should land and light a fire to cook our venison, for neither of\r\nus fancied having to spend the night cramped up in a canoe.\r\n\r\n\"Let us first give another shout.  Perhaps they'll hear it, and know\r\nwhere we are,\" I said.\r\n\r\nWe hailed two or three times.  At last, as there was only just\r\nsufficient light to enable us to see our way, we paddled up to the bank,\r\nunloaded our canoe, and hauled her up.  We then piled up the venison,\r\ncovering it over with the deerskin, lighted a fire, and began cooking\r\nsome steaks.  We were thus engaged when we heard a rustling in the\r\nbrushwood.  We started up with our guns in our hands, expecting to see a\r\ndeer or bear, when Bouncer came rushing towards us, leaping up and\r\nlicking his jaws.  Martin examined his mouth and sides.\r\n\r\n\"Depend upon it he has had a good tuck-out, the rogue, and feels in a\r\nhappy humour,\" observed Martin.  \"They have killed a deer, and we shall\r\nsee them here before long.\"\r\n\r\nMartin was right, for in a few minutes Alick and Robin came trudging up\r\nto the camp, heavily-laden with venison.\r\n\r\n\"We have brought you something to eat, boys,\" said Alick.  \"Thanks to\r\nBouncer's guidance, we followed up one of the deer till we shot him, but\r\nwe have had a heavy tramp back.  We should have brought the deerskin,\r\nbut the meat was of more consequence, and we must go back and get it\r\nto-morrow morning.  Hillo! you seem to have got something!\"\r\n\r\n\"I think we have,\" I answered, exhibiting our pile of venison.\r\n\r\nWe then described how we had shot the deer; still, as the deerskin would\r\nprove of value for many purposes, we settled to go for it at daylight.\r\n\r\nWe had now an abundance of venison, in addition to some of the dried\r\nbear's flesh which still remained.  Though the Indians often suffer from\r\nhunger in this region, so teeming with animal life, it is entirely in\r\nconsequence of their own want of forethought, as most of them when they\r\nobtain food feast on it till it is gone, and few are wise enough to lay\r\nup a store for the future.  Thousands of buffalo are slaughtered on the\r\nprairies, and their carcasses allowed to rot, which, if distributed\r\namong the people, would supply every native in the country with an\r\nabundance of wholesome food.\r\n\r\nWe had never been without provisions, though sometimes we had run rather\r\nshort.  We had, therefore, no fear for the future.\r\n\r\nNext morning, Alick and Robin having obtained the skin of the deer they\r\nhad shot, we proceeded on our voyage.  We at first made good way, aided\r\nby the current; but as the day advanced, a strong wind arose which\r\ncreated a considerable amount of sea in the river.  Our canoe being more\r\ndeeply laden than usual, with the venison we had on board, the water\r\nbegan to wash over the bows.\r\n\r\nWe had set Robin to work to bail it out; still there appeared to be no\r\nactual danger, and we continued our course.  As we went on, however, the\r\nwind increased, and meeting the current, which here ran stronger than in\r\nother places, the canoe was half filled by a foaming wave into which she\r\nplunged.\r\n\r\nRobin bailed away with all his might.\r\n\r\n\"This will never do,\" cried Alick.  \"If we meet another wave like that\r\nthe canoe will be swamped.  We must make for the shore.  Paddle away,\r\nboys, as fast as you can!\"\r\n\r\nWe exerted ourselves to the utmost, for we saw the danger to which we\r\nwere exposed.  Martin proposed throwing some of the cargo overboard.\r\n\r\n\"Not if we can help it,\" cried Alick.  \"It would be a pity to lose so\r\nmuch good meat.  The water looks smoother towards the south bank, and we\r\nshall soon be out of danger.\"\r\n\r\nIn this respect he was not mistaken, but we saw that had we continued on\r\nlonger the canoe would to a certainty have been filled, for line after\r\nline of white breakers extended completely across the stream.  We found\r\na safe place for landing, with a sufficient number of trees and\r\nbrushwood to afford us fuel for our fire, the place also being sheltered\r\nby a high bank from the wind.  We landed our cargo, and hauling up the\r\ncanoe, turned her over to empty out the water.  It seemed a wonder from\r\nthe quantity there was in her that she had not sunk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TEN.\r\n\r\nTANNING--THE PRAIRIE ON FIRE--\"HILLO!  PAT CASEY!  WHAT!  DON'T YOU\r\nREMEMBER US?\"--PAT'S MARVELLOUS ADVENTURES AND HAIRBREADTH ESCAPES--\r\nVEGETABLE DIET--PAT'S HUT--MARTIN'S DANGER--ALICK'S NOBLE CONDUCT--\"HE\r\nIS STILL ALIVE,\" CRIED ALICK--OUR WIGWAM--TWO MEN SICK IN THE CAMP--\r\nINDIAN SUMMER--SNOW AGAIN--WINTER HAS SET IN--WATTAP NETS--FISHING\r\nTHROUGH THE ICE--ROAST FISH AND BOILED FISH.\r\n\r\nAs the wind continued blowing with great force, we saw that there was no\r\nprospect of our continuing our voyage that day.  We therefore made\r\npreparations for camping as usual.\r\n\r\nMartin suggested that we should employ the time in drying some of the\r\nvenison, which could not possibly last till it was all consumed.  He\r\nadvised also that we should try to manufacture some pemmican, which,\r\nthough not equal to that of buffalo, would make nutritious food.  We\r\nwere thus busily employed for the remainder of the day.  Alick, too, who\r\nwished to prepare the deerskins, stretched them out with pegs on the\r\nbank.  We then carefully scraped them over, and having boiled some wood\r\nashes in water, we washed them thoroughly with it.  This we did twice\r\nbefore dark, leaving them to dry during the night.\r\n\r\n\"I hope no grasshoppers will come this way,\" observed Alick, laughing,\r\nwhile we were afterwards seated at supper.\r\n\r\nAs I looked round on the river, my eye caught a bright glare reflected\r\non it.\r\n\r\n\"That light comes from a fire somewhere, and not far off,\" I exclaimed;\r\nand, springing to my feet, I made my way up to the top of the bank,\r\nwhich was somewhat higher than the country farther off.\r\n\r\nThere were but few trees, so that I had an uninterrupted view to the\r\nsouthward.\r\n\r\nThere was a fire indeed, and such a fire as I had never before seen.\r\nAbout half a mile off appeared what looked like a vast burning lake,\r\nabout a mile in width, and extending to a much greater distance.\r\n\r\nPresently, beyond it, another began to blaze up, increasing with\r\nterrible rapidity; and, farther off, a third bright light was seen,\r\nwhich also began quickly to extend itself.  I have never seen a volcano\r\nin full activity; but this, I think, must have surpassed in grandeur the\r\nmost terrible eruption.  The flames rose up to an extraordinary height,\r\nrushing over the ground at the speed of racehorses, and devouring every\r\ntree and shrub in their course.  The wind being from the north-east blew\r\nit away from us; but we saw how fearful would have been our doom, had we\r\nbeen on foot travelling across that part of the country.  We should have\r\nhad no chance of escape, for the intervals which at first existed\r\nbetween these lakes of fire quickly filled up.\r\n\r\nThe conflagration swept on to the westward, gradually also creeping up\r\ntowards us.  We continued watching it, unable to tear ourselves away\r\nfrom the spot.  It was grand and awful in the extreme.  To arrest its\r\nprogress would have been utterly beyond the power of human beings.  What\r\nmight be able to stop it, we could not tell.  As far as we could see, it\r\nmight go on leaping over rivers and streams, destroying the woods and\r\nburning up the prairies to the very foot of the Rocky Mountains, or even\r\nmaking its fearful progress over the whole of the continent.\r\n\r\nWe knew that prairie fires often took place, and we had seen some on a\r\nsmaller scale; but this appeared to us more extensive than any we had\r\nheard of.  Gradually it came creeping up towards us; still, however, at\r\ntoo slow a pace, in consequence of the power of the wind, to make us\r\nquit our post.\r\n\r\n\"This, I have no doubt, has been `put out' by the Plain Crees, to\r\nprevent the buffalo from going to the eastward and benefiting the\r\nOjibbeways, Wood Crees, and other natives in that direction,\" observed\r\nAlick, using a term common among the Indians--to \"put out fire\"\r\nsignifying to set the prairie on fire.\r\n\r\nI could scarcely suppose that such would have been done on purpose; but\r\nhe asserted that they very frequently committed this destructive act\r\nsimply as a signal to let their friends know that they had found\r\nbuffalo; and that in most instances the fire did not extend to any great\r\ndistance, being stopped by marshes, or even narrow streams, when there\r\nwas not much wind, and sometimes by a heavy fall of rain.\r\n\r\nRobin corroborated what Alick had stated.\r\n\r\n\"I think the fire has got much nearer than when we first saw it,\"\r\nobserved Martin.  \"Should the wind shift, we shall have to run for it,\r\nor the burning trees will be tumbling down upon us and our canoe, and we\r\nshall be very foolish to be thus caught.\"\r\n\r\nIn the course of a few minutes after this the wind did shift, and the\r\nflames came leaping and crackling towards us.\r\n\r\n\"We will follow Martin's advice,\" said Alick.  \"We shall have plenty of\r\ntime though, I hope, to get our traps on board and shove off.  We must\r\nlook out for another camping-ground to spend the remainder of the\r\nnight.\"\r\n\r\nWe hastened down the bank, followed by Bouncer, who stood for some\r\nseconds barking furiously at the fire, as if indignant at its having put\r\nus to flight.  We were not long in launching our canoe, reloading her,\r\nand tumbling in the skins; when, shoving off, we paddled to a safe\r\ndistance from the shore.  In a couple of minutes we saw the flames reach\r\nthe base of the narrow line of trees which lined the bank; when, aided\r\nby the dry creepers which encircled them, it climbed up at a rapid rate,\r\ntwisting and turning and springing from branch to branch till the whole\r\nwood presented a solid wall of fire.  It could not injure us, as the\r\nwind, blowing in the opposite direction, carried the falling boughs away\r\nfrom the river.  The valley a little to the eastward prevented the\r\nconflagration from extending in that direction, but it still gave forth\r\nsufficient light to enable us to select a sheltered bay, into which we\r\nsteered the canoe.  Here we again landed, hoping to remain unmolested\r\nfor the rest of the night.  As the wind was cold we lighted a fire,\r\nthough we could find no bark with which to put up a lean-to.\r\n\r\nWe had therefore to sleep as well as we could on the bare ground.  Very\r\nfrequently one or other of us climbed to the top of the bank to watch\r\nthe progress of the flames.  They were sweeping along to the west and\r\nsouth-west, leaving a space in their rear still glowing with the burning\r\nembers.\r\n\r\nAlick, who was anxious to get the skins dressed as soon as possible,\r\nagain spread them out, and those of us who were unable to sleep employed\r\nourselves in beating them with the paddles.  As soon, also, as we could\r\nscrape a sufficient quantity of ashes from the fire we made a ley, with\r\nwhich we kept them moist, the effect being to render them soft and\r\npliable.\r\n\r\nBefore morning the fire had got to a considerable distance, but we could\r\nstill see a thin line of flame extending from north to south.  After\r\nall, I believe that it was not so destructive as we had supposed.  At\r\nthe same time, such fires constantly occurring on the prairies render\r\nthem arid and sterile and prevent the growth of forest trees.  Were any\r\nmeans taken to put a stop to their occurrence, willows and other trees\r\nwould soon sprout up, and the prairies would be converted into humid\r\ntracts in which vegetable matter would accumulate, and a soil be formed\r\nadapted to promote the growth of fine trees.\r\n\r\nWe were tempted to remain an hour or two after sunrise, for the sake of\r\nmaking progress with the dressing of our deerskins, and also to dry some\r\nmore venison, as it was very evident that it would not keep fresh wetted\r\nas it had been, with the sun beating down upon it, though covered up by\r\nthe skins.\r\n\r\n\"We have plenty to eat and plenty to drink,\" observed Martin, as we were\r\npaddling along; \"but I should very much like a variety, and unless we\r\ncan get it I am afraid that we shall be attacked by scurvy, or fall ill\r\nin some other way.\"\r\n\r\n\"To be sure, it will take us some time to drink up the water of the\r\nriver, but I don't know that the venison will hold out quite as long,\"\r\nsaid Robin.  \"We might find some berries and roots if we were to search\r\nfor them in any of the woods we may come to, or perhaps we might shoot\r\nsome birds or catch some fish.  I should like some fish amazingly.  We\r\nhave materials for lines, but I have not had time yet to manufacture\r\nsome hooks, as I intended.  If some of you like to search for berries\r\nand roots, or to shoot any birds you may meet, I'll undertake to stay by\r\nthe canoe and work away at the hooks.\"\r\n\r\n\"But if we delay, we shall not get to Fort Ross before the winter sets\r\nin,\" remarked Alick.\r\n\r\n\"But it will be better to be delayed than to fall sick from want of\r\nwholesome food,\" observed Martin.  \"I have an extraordinary longing for\r\nvegetable diet, and would give anything just now for a dish of greens,\r\nor mashed potatoes, or strawberries and cream.\"\r\n\r\nWhile this conversation was going on, we came to the mouth of a pretty\r\nlarge stream, the banks of which were covered with wood of considerable\r\ngrowth, while here and there grassy spots offered tempting\r\nlanding-places.\r\n\r\nMy feelings were very like Martin's, and Robin joining us, we all begged\r\nAlick to steer up the stream, intending to land and search for what we\r\nwere so eager to obtain.\r\n\r\nWe kept a lookout, some of us on one side of the canoe and some on the\r\nother, for any animals or birds which might appear on the bank.  Martin\r\nand I, who were in the bow, fancied we saw a deer on the right-hand\r\nside, and called Alick's attention to it.\r\n\r\nWhile we were looking out Robin, whose quick sight had been attracted by\r\nsome movements in the foliage, exclaimed, \"There's a man--an Indian.  If\r\nhe's an enemy, he'll have a shot at us;\" and pulling in his paddle, he\r\nseized his gun, ready to take aim at our supposed foe.  As he spoke we\r\nturned our heads round in the same direction, and we all saw among the\r\ntrees a human being stooping and apparently intently watching us.\r\n\r\n\"If he sees that we're all armed he won't fire, though he should have a\r\nmusket,\" said Alick.  \"We'll wave to him, and try to make him understand\r\nthat we have no wish to be foes to any one.  Show your fowling-pieces,\r\nlads!\"\r\n\r\nWe all lifted up our guns, then laying them down, again took to our\r\npaddles.  We now steered the canoe towards the shore, where we had seen\r\nthe man.  We soon reached a spot where we could land; but Alick desired\r\nus to sit still in the canoe, as possibly there might be other persons\r\nbesides the one we saw.\r\n\r\nThe gloom of the forest prevented our seeing his features, but on\r\ngetting nearer, to our surprise we perceived that the seeming Indian was\r\na white man, though clad from head to foot in skins.  There he stood, in\r\nan attitude of astonishment, with his mouth wide open, unable apparently\r\nto utter a word.  Though he was greatly altered, I felt sure that I knew\r\nthe man before me.\r\n\r\n\"Hillo!  Pat Casey!\"  I exclaimed.  \"What! don't you remember us?\"\r\n\r\n\"Och! shure, is it yourself that's spaking to me?\" exclaimed Pat, for\r\nPat he was--of that I had no doubt.  \"I belaved that you were all\r\nmurthered by the Injins months ago, and niver expected to see your faces\r\nagain.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you see that you were mistaken, Pat, and that we are all alive and\r\nwell,\" I said.\r\n\r\nWhile I was speaking, Pat had been slowly approaching, still evidently\r\ngreatly in doubt whether we were real beings of this world or spirits\r\nfrom another.  When at length he was convinced that we were ourselves,\r\nhe rushed forward towards us, and seizing me by the hand, exclaimed,\r\n\"Shure, it's a reality, and you have escaped the redskins.\"\r\n\r\nThe rest of the party also convinced him that we were alive by shaking\r\nhim warmly by the hand, and inquiring how he came to be there.\r\n\r\n\"Och! shure, but it's a sad story,\" he answered, \"and I'll be afther\r\ntelling you all about it.  I need not ask you whether you know that the\r\nfort was surprised by the Sioux, and all who could not escape put to\r\ndeath, for if you have been to the place you would have been afther\r\nseeing the state those thafes of the world left it in.  Sandy McTavish\r\nand I, with five others, managed to get away by leaping from the\r\nstockade on one side, as the redskins came in on the other; but short\r\ntime we had to do it and hide ourselves.  Making our way down to the\r\ncanoe, we had just time to shove off before they discovered us and sent\r\na shower of arrows whizzing round our heads.  As it was dark, they did\r\nnot take good aim, and though they came howling along on the top of the\r\nbank, we got over to the opposite side, and soon paddled out of their\r\nsight.  We had no food and only a couple of muskets which Sandy and I\r\ncarried off, for the other men had dropped theirs in their fright, and\r\nwhat was worse, we found that we had only a few charges of powder and\r\nshot.  We got on very well, barring the want of food--for we could see\r\nnothing to shoot--till we came to the rapids, and faith! it would have\r\nbeen betther if we hadn't thried to shoot them, for though Sandy and the\r\nother man had gone up and down them several times, it was always in a\r\nlarge canoe.  It was late in the day and getting dusk, and somehow or\r\nother Sandy, who was steering, let the canoe strike against a big rock.\r\nOver she went, with a hole knocked through her bows!  Having no fancy to\r\nbe drowned, I made a leap on to the rock, and shouting to my companions\r\nto follow, with many a hop, skip, and jump, managed to reach the shore;\r\nbut when I looked out for the rest of us, I could nowhere see them.  I\r\nshouted again and again, but they did not answer.  My belafe is that\r\nthey were all carried away and drowned.  I sat down on the bank, and at\r\nlast, as I had been awake for many a long hour, I fell fast asleep.\r\nWhen I awoke in the morning, not a sight was there of the canoe, and I\r\nthought to myself, What was I to do?  I knew that Fort Ross was\r\nsomewhere in the direction the sun was used to rise, and so thinks I, if\r\nI kape along in that direction I shall some day get there.  I had only\r\nfour charges of powder in my pouch, and as I might have been afther\r\nstarving when I had shot it all away, I felt gloomy enough.  However,\r\nthere was no use sighing, so I got up and set forward.  As ill-luck\r\nwould have it, I missed the first two shots, but with the third I killed\r\nan aigle, or bird of that sort.  It was not very good ateing, anyhow,\r\nbut it kept body and soul together for a day or two.  I had now got only\r\none charge remaining, and thinks I to myself, I'll never be reaching\r\nFort Ross with this, if I don't manage to kill a deer or some other big\r\nbaste which would give me mate enough to last me all the way.  I went on\r\nall day, eagerly looking out for a deer or a buffalo or a bear, and\r\nthinking how I could get up to it to make shure.  At last, what should I\r\nsee between the trees but a crayther with big horns cropping the grass\r\nall alone.  Thinks I to myself, `If I can creep up and put a shot into\r\nhis head, I'll have mate enough to last me for a month to come.'  There\r\nwas no time to be lost, so creeping along Indian fashion, I made towards\r\nhim.  I kept my gun all ready to fire, not knowing what moment he might\r\nstart off.  All the time I felt my heart beating pit-a-pat, for thinking\r\nwhat I should do if I missed.  `Take it easy,' says I to myself, but\r\nthat was no aisy matther.  At last I got within twenty yards of the\r\ndeer, who hadn't yet seen me.  It may be if I thry to get nearer, he'll\r\nknow there's danger near and will be off with a whisk of his tail, and\r\nmy bullet will be flying nowhere; so, just praying that I might shoot\r\nstraight, I raised my piece as he was lifting his head to look about\r\nhim.  I fired.  He leaped into the air, and I thought he was going to be\r\noff; but instead of doing that same, over he fell.  `Hurrah! good luck\r\nto ye, Pat Casey,' I cried out, making the forest ring with my shouts.\r\nI soon had some slices off the deer, and lighting a fire where I was, I\r\nquickly cooked them, for I had had nothing to eat since I had finished\r\nthe aigle.  I had now food enough to last me till I could reach the\r\nfort, but how to kape it swate till then was the question.  I thried to\r\nsmoke some, but I did not manage it altogether well.  I was still\r\nconsidering what to do when, going into the wood to get some more sticks\r\nfor my fire, I saw the river running directly in front of me.  At first\r\nI thought it was the big sthrame itself, but when I looked down it and\r\nup it, I saw that it was neither, and that if I was going to reach Fort\r\nRoss I must cross it somehow or other, but how to get over was the\r\nthrouble.  I'd be dhrowned if I thried, and be no better off than poor\r\nSandy and the rest, so at last I thought to myself, `I'll just squat\r\nwhere I am; maybe some canoes will be coming this way, or some friendly\r\nIndians will be finding me out.'  Well, that's the long and short of my\r\nhistory.\"\r\n\r\nWe agreed that Pat, perhaps, had acted wisely, knowing the difficulties\r\nhe would have had to encounter, had he continued his journey overland.\r\nHe took us to his hut, which was a short distance from the bank of the\r\nriver.  It was very well formed of birch-bark, and of good size.  He had\r\nmade himself a bed from the tops of spruce firs.  Alongside it was a\r\nsmaller hut in which he had hung up his venison.  The top of this\r\nsmaller wigwam was covered with the deer's skin.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer he might have done very well, but in the winter he\r\nwould, I suspect, have perished from cold and hunger, as he would have\r\nhad great difficulty in catching any animals.  It was indeed fortunate\r\nfor him that we had put into that river.\r\n\r\nWe did not forget the object for which we had visited it, and we\r\nimmediately set to work, under the guidance of Robin, to search for\r\nroots and berries.\r\n\r\nOf the latter, Pat had already collected a great quantity for present\r\nuse, but remembering how nearly poisoned we had been, he was afraid to\r\ncook any roots.  Robin, however, knew well what were good to eat and\r\nwhat were pernicious, and we had perfect confidence in his judgment.\r\n\r\nAltogether we added a considerable amount of what I may call vegetables\r\nto our stock.  As we all had a peculiar longing for them, we at once\r\ncooked as many as we could eat, scarcely touching the venison, of which\r\nwe had already begun to get tired.\r\n\r\nPat, who appeared to consider himself at home, begged that we would\r\noccupy his hut for the night, remarking that it was already too late to\r\nmake much progress before nightfall.  We accordingly agreed to stay\r\nwhere we were till the following morning.\r\n\r\nHis stock of venison added to ours would enable us to perform the voyage\r\nwithout having again to stop and hunt for game.  Martin had been\r\nemploying himself, as he had undertaken to do, in manufacturing some\r\nhooks and lines, aided by Robin, who had learned very ingenious arts\r\nfrom the Indians.  The rest of us employed the evening in cutting out\r\nsome moccasins, for not one of us had a pair of shoes to our feet, and\r\nshould we have to make any portages we should seriously suffer in having\r\nto walk with our loads over the hard ground.\r\n\r\nWe used but a small portion of our deerskins.  We intended the remainder\r\nto serve as a covering for our provisions in the daytime, and for\r\nourselves at night, should the weather become cold.  Our intention,\r\nhowever, was to kill two or three bears, the skins of which might better\r\nanswer the latter purpose.  It was with evident regret that Pat the next\r\nmorning left the hut in which he had made himself so completely at home;\r\nstill, he had no wish to remain behind.\r\n\r\n\"If I had but a few pigs and praties,\" he observed, with a sigh, \"I'd\r\nsoon be afther making a garden of this wilderness.\"\r\n\r\nAgain we were paddling down the stream, with Pat on board.  There was\r\nroom for him, and though his weight brought the canoe much deeper in the\r\nwater than before, as long as it remained calm we had no fear.\r\n\r\nWe paddled along, and were speaking to Pat of the possibility that Sandy\r\nand the other men had escaped.  He, however, declared that they must\r\nhave been drowned, as he had seen them, he asserted, a long way below\r\nthe rocks in the seething foam, through which it would be impossible for\r\nthem to swim; still, we had some hopes--knowing the dangers from which\r\nsome men manage to escape--that they had saved their lives.\r\n\r\nMartin had manufactured some hooks, and had greatly improved his\r\nfish-spear, of which he was very proud.  We had not gone far when we\r\ncame to a slight rapid, down which, however, Alick declared he should\r\nhave no difficulty in steering the canoe; though the water ran swiftly\r\nand a few dark rocks appeared above the surface, as there were no waves\r\nof any size and but comparatively little foam, there did not appear to\r\nbe much danger.\r\n\r\nMartin, who was seated in the bow, exclaimed, \"I saw a sturgeon pass us\r\njust now; if I catch sight of any more, I must have one of them.\"\r\n\r\nPresently, before Alick could warn him of the danger he was running, he\r\nstood up and darted his spear.  The next instant what was our horror to\r\nsee him fall over headlong into the water, the line attached to the\r\nspear catching as he did so round his leg!\r\n\r\nI was sitting next to him, and attempted to catch hold of one of his\r\nfeet, which hung for a moment on the gunwale.\r\n\r\nThe canoe was nearly upset, the water rushing quickly in.  At the same\r\ntime, her bow being stopped she was brought broadside to the current.\r\nBefore I could catch Martin's foot, it slipped off the gunwale, and he\r\ndisappeared under the waves.\r\n\r\n\"He's Rose's brother, and for his own sake I must save him!\" exclaimed\r\nAlick, and without considering the fearful danger he was running of\r\nlosing his own life, he threw himself over the stern, and swam towards\r\nthe spot where Martin had disappeared.\r\n\r\nRobin, who was sitting next to him, seizing the steering-paddle, with\r\ngreat presence of mind brought the canoe with her bow down the stream.\r\n\r\n\"Back, both of you!\" he shouted out to Pat and me.\r\n\r\nWe did as he advised, but the strong current drove the canoe downwards.\r\nJust below us a dark rock of some extent rose above the water, and we\r\nhad to exert ourselves to the utmost to avoid drifting against it.\r\n\r\nWith the deepest interest we watched Alick's progress.  Presently down\r\nhe dived, and to our joy returned holding Martin in one hand, and\r\nenergetically treading water, while with the other hand he released him\r\nfrom the line which had got round his leg.  The current was rapidly\r\nbearing them down towards the rock.\r\n\r\nI should have said that there was another rock, just above where the\r\naccident happened, and though it scarcely rose above the surface, it had\r\nthe effect of deflecting the current, thus causing it to run with less\r\nviolence than would otherwise have been the case against the larger\r\nrock.  Lower down, a powerful swimmer such as Alick was could alone have\r\nborne up another person, and that person almost senseless, and at the\r\nsame time have contrived to direct his course amid those furious waters.\r\nWe were using all our efforts to get up to him.\r\n\r\n\"Keep off!\" he shouted.  \"You will upset the canoe if you attempt to\r\ntake us on board.  I'll make for the rock.\"\r\n\r\nThat he would be able to do so, however, seemed very doubtful, and we\r\ntrembled for his and Martin's safety, while we still plied our paddles\r\nto stem the current and at the same time to avoid the rock.\r\n\r\n\"Go to the other side,\" shouted Alick; \"and, Pat, you get on the rock\r\nand help me.\"\r\n\r\nUnderstanding his intentions, and seeing that it was the best course to\r\npursue, we obeyed his order, and turning round into our usual position\r\nwhen paddling, we directed the canoe so as to round the southern end of\r\nthe rock, and then, though drifted down some yards, we once more paddled\r\nup to it on its eastern or lower side.  Here we could approach it\r\nwithout difficulty, and finding bottom with our paddles, Pat, as\r\ndirected, stepped out, and clambered up to the top of the rock.\r\n\r\nA minute or more of intense anxiety had passed since we had last seen\r\nAlick and Martin; and Robin and I looked eagerly up at Pat to hear his\r\nreport.  Without uttering a word, however, we saw him slip down to the\r\nother side of the rock.\r\n\r\n\"Can they have sunk!\" exclaimed Robin.  \"He would have told us if he had\r\nseen them.\"\r\n\r\n\"He would not have gone down the rock had they disappeared,\" I answered,\r\nbut still I felt terribly anxious, and wished that Alick had told me to\r\nland instead of Pat; still, under such circumstances, it is always wise\r\nto obey orders, and I hoped for the best.\r\n\r\nTo leave the canoe and go to their assistance would be dangerous in the\r\nextreme, as, should she drift away, Robin would be unable by himself to\r\npaddle her back.  I could not, however, resist the temptation of sending\r\nBouncer, and one pat on the back while I pointed to the top of the rock\r\nwas sufficient to make him leap on to it and climb to the top.\r\n\r\nThe loud bark he gave and the wag of his tail, as he looked down on the\r\nother side, convinced me that our companions were safe, and presently\r\nafterwards I saw Alick and Pat lifting Martin's apparently inanimate\r\nbody to the summit.\r\n\r\n\"He is still alive,\" cried Alick; \"but we must reach the shore, and get\r\na fire lighted as soon as possible.\"\r\n\r\nHe said no more, except to direct us to bring the stern of the canoe\r\ncloser to the rock.\r\n\r\nThis we did, when, wading into the water, he placed Martin on board, he\r\nhimself getting in, followed by Pat and Bouncer.\r\n\r\nWe were now, we found, close to the foot of the rapid, and a few more\r\nstrokes carried us into comparatively still water.  A short distance\r\noff, on the left bank, was a wood of some size.  The bank, which here\r\nformed a small bay, was sufficiently low to enable us to land; we\r\npaddled rapidly towards it, but when we got near the spot we found that\r\nthe water was not of sufficient depth to allow the canoe, heavily-laden\r\nas she was, to get alongside.  Pat therefore stepped out, and loading\r\nhimself with a couple of packages of meat and all the skins, carried\r\nthem on shore.  The rest of us then getting into the water, we were able\r\nto drag the canoe much nearer to the bank.  On this, Alick lifting\r\nMartin by the shoulders and I taking his legs, we carried him on shore.\r\n\r\nHe made no movement, and as I looked into his face I certainly feared\r\nthat he was dead.  Robin must have thought the same, for, putting his\r\nhands before his eyes, he burst into tears.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! he's gone, he's gone!\" he murmured.\r\n\r\nWe could say nothing to reassure our young friend.  An open space being\r\nfound, Pat spread out the skins, and without a moment's loss of time\r\nbegan to collect wood for a fire.  As soon as Robin and I had unloaded\r\nthe canoe and lifted her up the bank, we assisted him, while Alick,\r\nregardless of himself, was getting off Martin's wet garments.  Having\r\ndone so, he called and desired me to rub his feet and hands, while we\r\nwrapped him up in the skins.\r\n\r\nOur friend was still breathing, which gave us some encouragement, and we\r\ncontinued our exertions without ceasing.  As soon as the fire was\r\nlighted we placed him as close to it as was prudent, while Pat and Robin\r\ncut some stakes and collected some bark to form a lean-to, that we might\r\nstill further shelter him.  He at length opened his eyes and recognised\r\nus, but was still unable to speak.  We continued rubbing him, our hopes\r\nof his complete restoration being raised.\r\n\r\nPat, also by Alick's directions, got water and put some venison on to\r\nboil, that we might have broth to pour down his throat as soon as he was\r\nable to swallow it.  The improvement we looked for was, however, so\r\ngradual that I proposed--as it was impossible for us to continue our\r\nvoyage till the next day--that it would be advisable to build a wigwam,\r\nwhich would afford better shelter than the lean-to during the night.\r\n\r\n\"I agree with you,\" answered Alick, \"and the sooner you set about it the\r\nbetter.\"\r\n\r\n\"So we will,\" I said; \"but I wish that you would get off your wet\r\nclothes, or, strong as you are, you may suffer from remaining in them so\r\nlong.\"\r\n\r\nAlick laughed at this notion.  \"This fire will soon dry me,\" he\r\nanswered, \"and I'll stay by it and attend to Martin while you three\r\ncollect the materials and build the wigwam.\"\r\n\r\nI in vain expostulated with my brother.  Even though my clothes were\r\ndry, except my moccasins and the lower part of my trousers, I felt the\r\nwind very chilly.  At last I was obliged to set off with Pat and Robin.\r\n\r\nWe settled to put up a good large wigwam, which might hold us all; and\r\nwe could then have a fire in the centre.  This for Martin's sake would\r\nbe very important.  We accordingly cut down the largest saplings we\r\ncould find, and we were fortunate in discovering numerous large sheets\r\nof bark, some in a sufficiently good condition to have formed a canoe,\r\nhad we been compelled to build one.\r\n\r\nA very short time only is necessary to erect a birch-bark wigwam when\r\nmaterials are abundant, as they were in the present instance; and it is\r\nwonderful what a comfortable abode it affords, impervious alike to rain\r\nor wind or even to an ordinary amount of cold.\r\n\r\nWhen in a sheltered situation, the Indians pass most severe winters in\r\nthese habitations, built in the recesses of cypress groves, through\r\nwhich the chilling blast fails to find an entrance.  Having put up the\r\nwigwam, we cleared away the grass from the interior, and then dug a\r\nslight hole in the centre, which we surrounded with the largest stones\r\nwe could find.  This was to form our fireplace.  Four little trenches\r\naround it, leading to the bottom, would enable a sufficient current of\r\nair to enter and keep it blazing.  Our next care was to cut down a good\r\nsupply of spruce fir tops to form couches.\r\n\r\nThe wigwam was quite large enough for all of us, including Bouncer, and\r\nwould have held another guest, leaving ample space between the feet of\r\nthe sleepers and the fire.  We little thought at the time how long we\r\nshould require it.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it was finished, we lifted Martin up on one of the skins, and\r\ncarried him into it.  He was aware of what we were doing, for as I bent\r\nover him I heard him whisper, \"Thank you! thank you!\" but he could say\r\nno more.\r\n\r\nThe soup, which was now ready, greatly revived him, and we ourselves,\r\nafter our exertions, were glad of a hearty meal.\r\n\r\nI observed Alick, while we were seated round our fire in the wigwam,\r\nshivering several times, while he looked unusually pale.\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid you're ill,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it is nothing; I shall be better after supper and some sleep,\" he\r\nanswered.  \"My plunge into the cold water was somewhat trying, perhaps;\r\nand I wish I had followed your advice, and dried my clothes at once.\"\r\n\r\nI begged him to put on my coat, and to cover himself up with one of the\r\ndeerskins, which was not required for Martin, while his clothes were\r\nmore effectually dried.  To this he at last consented, and we hung them\r\nup on the side of the fire opposite to that where Martin lay, so as not\r\nto deprive him of the warmth.\r\n\r\nOn going out into the open air, we were sensible of the great difference\r\nof temperature which existed inside the hut and outside.  We found it\r\nnecessary to keep the entrance open, instead of closing it with a piece\r\nof bark which we had prepared for the purpose.\r\n\r\nAlick's clothes were soon quite dry, when, having put them on, he\r\nstretched himself on the bed we had prepared for him.  As he did so, I\r\nsaw him again shiver violently several times.  This made me more than\r\never apprehensive that he had received a chill.  He confessed, indeed,\r\nthat his head ached terribly, and that he felt sometimes extremely hot,\r\nand then very cold.  Even a mugful of hot soup, which we got him to\r\nswallow, did not seem to do him any good; and as he was now unable to\r\nattend to Martin, I took his place.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, as I feared, though Martin was slightly better, Alick\r\nwas very ill and utterly unfit to proceed on the voyage.  We at once\r\nmade up our minds to remain where we were for that day, or perhaps for\r\nlonger if necessary.  Alick, though very weak, was perfectly conscious.\r\n\r\n\"Don't lose time,\" he whispered to me; \"but do you and Robin go out and\r\ntry and shoot some game.  If our voyage is delayed we may be running\r\nshort of provisions.  Pat will remain with Martin and me, for as he is\r\nno shot, he would only be throwing the ammunition away.\"\r\n\r\nPat, who was not vain of his powers as a sportsman, readily consented to\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n\"Shure, I'll be afther taking good care of the jintleman,\" he said.  \"If\r\na bear or a wolf comes this way, faith, he'll be sorry for it to the end\r\nof his days.\"\r\n\r\nBouncer accompanied us, and he was so well-trained that he would assist\r\nus greatly should we fall in with a deer.  We were more successful even\r\nthan we expected, for we killed a small deer and three squirrels, and on\r\nour return saw several other animals--another deer, a raccoon lodged\r\ncomfortably high up between the branches of a tree, a black fox, and a\r\nwolverine; which showed us that, should we have to remain on the spot,\r\nwe were not likely to run short of provisions.\r\n\r\n\"If we have to remain out during the winter, we shall want skins of all\r\nsorts to make clothes and bed-coverings,\" observed Robin.\r\n\r\n\"Why do you say that?\"  I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Because I think that there is a great chance of our not getting to the\r\nfort before the winter sets in,\" he answered.  \"We have already been a\r\nlong time about our voyage, and I fear, both from your brother's and\r\nMartin's state, that we may be detained here several days.  Alick's\r\nfever is only just commencing, and Martin cannot recover in a hurry;\r\nthough he's not worse to-day, he's very little better.\"\r\n\r\nI could not help agreeing with him, and when we got back to the camp we\r\nwere both confirmed in the opinion he had expressed.  Alick's fever had\r\nincreased, and Martin was still so weak that he could only just open his\r\neyes and utter a few words in a low voice.  Pat had been very attentive\r\nin feeding him with small mouthfuls of soup at a time--the best thing he\r\ncould do.\r\n\r\nPoor Alick could take nothing, though he was thankful to have his lips\r\nmoistened with cold water.  Robin and I felt very anxious about their\r\ncondition, but we did not let them see this, and endeavoured to keep up\r\ntheir spirits and our own.  The fresh meat we had brought was of great\r\nbenefit to Martin, as Pat could make better soup with it than he had\r\nbefore been able to do with the dry venison.  The next day we were all\r\ntoo much alarmed about Alick even to leave the wigwam; indeed, for\r\nseveral days he seemed to hang between life and death, till a turn came,\r\nand he began slowly to mend--so slowly, though, that we gave up all\r\nhopes of continuing our voyage.  Martin got better rather more rapidly,\r\nand was at length able to assist in attending to Alick.  He did so with\r\nthe greatest care.  He was aware of the gallant way, with the fearful\r\nrisk of losing his own life, in which Alick had saved his.\r\n\r\nThe Indian summer--that period between the first breaking up of the real\r\nsummer weather and the setting in of the frost--lasted but a few days.\r\nThe leaves of the trees changed from green to varied tints of red,\r\nbrown, yellow, and purple, hanging but a short time, and the first icy\r\nwinds brought them in showers to the ground.\r\n\r\nOne morning, when we looked out of our wigwam, the whole face of nature\r\nwas changed.  The boughs of the trees were bending with the snow, and\r\nthe country on every side was covered with a sheet of white.  By closing\r\nthe entrance of our wigwam, and keeping a fire constantly burning, we\r\nmaintained a sufficient heat in the interior.  The severe frost,\r\nhowever, of that northern region had not yet commenced; but come it\r\nwould, we knew, and we talked earnestly of the means we must take to\r\nenable us to encounter it.  Robin and I had been pretty successful with\r\nour guns, and we had kept our party well supplied with game.  We had\r\nkilled two more deer, and should have been glad to fall in with three or\r\nfour bears for the sake of their skins; but, except that of the bear\r\nAlick had killed, we had no other.  Still, we had reason to be thankful\r\nthat we had deerskins sufficient to clothe all the party.\r\n\r\nAs Martin got better he employed himself in making some small nets of\r\nwattap, of which we obtained a plentiful supply.  He had also\r\nmanufactured another spear, and he proposed, as soon as he was able to\r\ngo out, to attempt catching some fish.\r\n\r\nDuring one of our excursions, Robin and I had reached the shore of a\r\nfine lake, in the clear water of which we had seen several large\r\nwhite-fish; and when we told Martin, he begged that we would take his\r\nnet and spear and try to catch them.\r\n\r\n\"But they are all under the ice now, for the lake must be frozen over,\"\r\nI observed.\r\n\r\n\"So much the better; you will catch them the more easily,\" he answered.\r\n\"All you have to do is to cut a hole in the ice, and let down the net,\r\nand the fish which will come to breathe at the open water are sure to be\r\ncaught.\"\r\n\r\nAs Martin himself was unable to go out, Robin and I undertook to follow\r\nhis directions, at which he appeared greatly pleased.  As both he and\r\nAlick seemed to wish for fish we set off at once, leaving Pat to take\r\ncare of them.\r\n\r\nWe found the lake completely frozen over, and though the ice was not yet\r\nvery thick, it was sufficiently so to bear our weight.  With our long\r\nsheath-knives we contrived after some labour to cut a hole in the ice;\r\nwe then let down one of the nets, holding tight to the upper edge.  We\r\nhad not long to wait, when we felt by the violent agitation of the net\r\nthat a fish had been caught.  We hauled it carefully in, not knowing\r\nwhether the fish might escape; but it was securely fastened by the\r\ngills, and we soon had it safe.  It weighed, we calculated, between six\r\nand eight pounds.\r\n\r\nOur success encouraged us to proceed, and another fish, of a still\r\nlarger size, was captured.\r\n\r\n\"This is good fun,\" cried Robin.  \"We shall never want food while we can\r\ncatch fish in this fashion.\"\r\n\r\nAgain we put down the net; but though we waited long, no fish came into\r\nit.  Losing patience, we agreed to cut another hole at some distance\r\noff, fancying that the fish might have been frightened at seeing their\r\ncompanions drawn so suspiciously out of the water.  Having cut the hole,\r\nwe, as before, let down the net, and shortly afterwards captured a third\r\nfish.  I suspect that, had we remained at the first hole, we should have\r\nbeen equally successful.\r\n\r\nThe fish at this early season of the year were probably swimming about\r\nfreely under the water, and did not require the fresh air which\r\nafterwards would become so welcome to them.  We cut two or three other\r\nholes, and altogether caught five fish--a pretty fair load to carry\r\nhome.  We had the advantage, at this season of the year, of being able\r\nto keep them fresh; for they froze soon after they were taken out of the\r\nwater, and would remain thus perfectly stiff till the return of spring,\r\nor till put into water, when the frost would be drawn out of them.\r\n\r\nThat evening, for supper, we had roasted fish and boiled fish, both of\r\nwhich Alick and Martin greatly relished.  We made several trips after\r\nthis to the lake, and the first day Martin was able to set out on an\r\nexcursion he accompanied us.  On that day we were more successful than\r\never, owing to his superior skill and practical experience.  We each\r\nreturned home heavily-laden.\r\n\r\nAlick was still too weak to go out, but he had sufficiently recovered to\r\ntake an interest in all that was going forward, as also to consider our\r\nprospects for the future.\r\n\r\n\"One thing is certain, boys: if we are to remain here, we must build a\r\nwarmer abode than our present one,\" he observed.  \"This does very well\r\nto sleep in at present; but, as you all know, we shall presently have\r\nweather when we may be frozen in our beds, even if we should manage to\r\nkeep up a fire all night.  We must build a log hut with a chimney of\r\nstones and clay.  I wish we had thought of it before, when the ground\r\nwas soft, and we could have dug up the stones and found mud to stop the\r\nintervals between the logs.  We may still manage it, but there is very\r\nlittle time to lose, I suspect, if we are to escape the fate of the\r\ngallant Willoughby and his brave men, who were all found frozen on board\r\ntheir ship to the north of Lapland.\"\r\n\r\nWe were all eager to do as Alick proposed, but as we had but one axe\r\nbetween us, it must be a slow process, I knew; and the axe might break,\r\nand the work be stopped altogether.  The next morning we commenced\r\noperations by marking a number of trees suited for the purpose.  Taking\r\nthe axe, I began chopping away at the first tree we intended to fell.\r\nNo further progress was, however, made in the work.  I had given but a\r\nfew strokes when I was interrupted in my task.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER ELEVEN.\r\n\r\nINDIANS ABROAD--THE LOG CABIN IN THE WILDERNESS--THE SICK MAN--THE OLD\r\nIRON POT--THE LITTER--BOUNCER IS LEFT IN A BARGE--MISTICOOK'S SLEDGE--\r\nRABUSHWAY'S ADVICE--ROBIN'S DELIGHT ON DISCOVERING HIS FATHER--PREPARING\r\nTO START--SNOW-SHOES AND FUR COATS--HONEST BOUNCER WORKS WELL IN\r\nHARNESS--TEA AND SUGAR A LUXURY--PAT'S UNLUCKY MISHAP--SNOW-BLINDNESS--\r\nCOYOTES--NO FOOD--THE DESERTED FORT--BEARS AND BEAR'S FLESH--WE START\r\nFOR TOUCHWOOD HILLS--WOLVES AND STARVATION--WE GO SUPPERLESS TO BED--\r\nTHONG SOUP--BOUNCER SAVES HIS BACON.\r\n\r\n\"Whist!

I caught sight of one of them not half an\r\nhour ago, away there down the river, as I was looking out for a bird or\r\na baste to shoot for Mister Alick's supper, seeing it's fresh mate he\r\nwants more than anything else to set him up again.  The redskin did not\r\ndiscover me, as his face was the other way; but I saw a wreath of smoke\r\ncurling up among the trees on the opposite bank of the river, and it was\r\ntowards it he was making his way.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Indian you saw may be a friend quite as likely as a foe,\" I\r\nanswered, not feeling much alarmed at Pat's report.  \"We must, however,\r\nfind out who he is.  I will consult my brother, and hear what he\r\nadvises.\"\r\n\r\n\"But if there are a whole band of Indians, they may come some night and\r\ntake our scalps while we are aslape,\" said Pat, who, though brave as\r\nneed be when it came to the pinch, held the Indians in especial dread.\r\n\r\nShouldering the axe, I called Martin and Robin, who were selecting trees\r\nfor our proposed hut at some little distance off.  I told them of the\r\ninformation I had just received from Pat, and together we returned to\r\nthe wigwam to consult Alick.  He took the matter with perfect composure.\r\n\r\n\"It is important to ascertain the position of their camp, and whether\r\nthere are few or many Indians,\" he observed.  \"Pat says he has only seen\r\none.  If I were well enough I would go out myself; but as it is, I think\r\nit will be best for you, David, and Robin to accompany Pat, and to try\r\nand get a sight of the camp.  As they must, if we remain here, discover\r\nus before long, it will be wise to try and get on friendly terms with\r\nthem.  It is possible that they may be well disposed towards the white\r\nmen, and have been accustomed to trade at the forts.  If you can get\r\nnear their camp without being discovered as evening approaches, you will\r\nbe able to ascertain how many there are of them, and to what tribe they\r\nbelong.  If you know them to be friends, you can at once go up to them\r\nand sit down at their fire.  If you are doubtful, it may be better for\r\nRobin alone to make his appearance.  You, Robin, can tell them that a\r\nparty of white men, who wish to become their friends, are encamped\r\nnear.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am very ready to do whatever you propose,\" answered Robin.  \"I shall\r\nhave no fear of going among them, whoever they may be, and I fully\r\nbelieve they are likely to prove friends.\"\r\n\r\n\"Should such be the case, tell them that we shall be able to assist each\r\nother.  If they have no firearms they can track out the game for us, and\r\nwe can shoot it and share the meat; and say that we will reward them\r\nliberally for any aid they may render us,\" said Alick.\r\n\r\nOur plan of proceeding was soon arranged.  Leaving Bouncer with Alick\r\nand Martin, Pat, Robin, and I set out towards the spot where the former\r\nhad seen the Indian.  We then crept forward in single file, carefully\r\nconcealing ourselves among the bushes, and before long saw a wreath of\r\nsmoke such as Pat had described curling up amid the trees at no great\r\ndistance off.\r\n\r\nThough Alick had advised us to wait till sundown, as we saw no one\r\nmoving about and the nature of the ground afforded us sufficient\r\nconcealment, we advanced farther, when what was our surprise, as we got\r\nround a thickly wooded point, to see, not an Indian wigwam, but a\r\nsubstantially built log cabin, with a stone chimney, from which the\r\nsmoke was ascending.\r\n\r\n\"The inhabitants, whoever they are, are not likely to be unfriendly,\"\r\nexclaimed Robin.  \"Let us go across the river at once and announce\r\nourselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Indians may possibly have taken possession of the log hut, and we\r\nshould follow Alick's directions,\" I observed.\r\n\r\n\"Then, as it seems doubtful, let me go alone,\" said Robin.  \"That will\r\nbe doing as Alick desired me, and I have no fear about the matter.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Robin was speaking, an Indian appeared at the door, whom we at\r\nonce knew from his appearance to be an Ojibbeway, and therefore a friend\r\nto the English.  He retired again into the hut.\r\n\r\nThis settled all our doubts as to the reception we were likely to meet\r\nwith.  Crossing the river, which was here strongly frozen over, we made\r\nour way towards the hut.  As we advanced we observed the remains of\r\nother buildings, and I now felt sure that it was a deserted missionary\r\nstation of which I had heard but had never visited, as it lay out of the\r\ndirect route between the forts.\r\n\r\nWho the inhabitants of the hut could be we could not surmise.  Probably\r\nthey were weatherbound travellers like ourselves.\r\n\r\n\"If Sandy and the other men hadn't been drowned, bedad, I should be\r\nafther thinking it was themselves,\" observed Pat.\r\n\r\nI greatly hoped that our friend Sandy had escaped, and that we should\r\nfind him occupying the hut.  It stood a little way back from the river,\r\non a piece of level ground, surrounded by trees whose branches were now\r\nweighed down with the snow.  Climbing up the bank, we were approaching\r\nthe door, when our footsteps must have been heard, for it opened, and\r\nthe same Indian we had before seen appeared, gun in hand.\r\n\r\nOn discovering that we were whites, he turned round and uttered a few\r\nwords, as if addressing some other person within.\r\n\r\n\"You friends!\" he exclaimed; \"glad see you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, indeed we are, and very glad to see you,\" I answered, advancing\r\nand putting out my hand.  He took it, and then went through the same\r\nceremony with Robin and Pat.\r\n\r\n\"Come in; but not make much noise,\" he said, looking over his shoulder;\r\n\"sick man in there--very sick; glad to see you; maybe you do him good.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope that we may,\" I said, as I advanced into the hut, followed by\r\nRobin and Pat.\r\n\r\nA fire was blazing on the hearth, and with his feet towards it lay a\r\ntall man on a low rough bunk covered over with a buffalo-robe.  I saw\r\nthat a number of things were piled up in the corner of the hut, but the\r\nscanty furniture was of the roughest description.  The whole was\r\ncomprised in a table formed of a slab of fir and a couple of\r\nthree-legged stools.\r\n\r\n\"Who are you, friends?\" asked the sick man on the bunk, feebly raising\r\nhis head to look at us.\r\n\r\nThere was no window in the hut to admit light, but the fire showed a\r\nbright glare on the countenance of the speaker.  It was thin and worn,\r\nand deadly pale; it seemed to me as I gazed at him that he could have\r\nbut a few days to live.\r\n\r\nDrawing near and sitting down on one of the stools which he bade me\r\ntake, I briefly told him of the capture of Fort Black, and of our\r\nseveral mishaps while endeavouring to make our way to Fort Ross.  I\r\nadded that my brother and a friend were at the camp a short distance\r\noff, but that the former was too ill to venture on the journey at this\r\ninclement season of the year, and that we were about to build a hut in\r\nwhich we might pass the winter.\r\n\r\n\"You are welcome to share this hut with me, or rather you have as much\r\nright to it as I have, except that possession is said to be nine-tenths\r\nof the law,\" he answered.  \"However, I will not dispute your right, and\r\nshould be very glad of your company, especially if you bring provisions;\r\nfor though I have enough for myself and my faithful Ojibbeways, I could\r\nnot undertake to feed five more mouths.\"\r\n\r\nI assured him that we should be very unwilling to exhaust his store;\r\nthat we had sufficient meat to last us for some time.\r\n\r\nWhile I was speaking, I saw him looking at Robin and Pat, but he asked\r\nno questions about them.  I told him that we must now return to the\r\ncamp, or my brother would be growing anxious, and that I hoped we should\r\nbe able to join him the next day, provided that Alick was well enough to\r\nbear the journey.\r\n\r\n\"You should not delay,\" he remarked, \"for we may expect the winter to\r\nset in shortly with far greater rigour than hitherto, and your brother\r\nmight suffer from being exposed to it.\"\r\n\r\n\"May I venture to ask how you came to be here?\"  I said, as I was\r\npreparing to go.\r\n\r\n\"By a very simple accident,\" he answered.  \"I was on a hunting\r\nexpedition with several followers when, while in the neighbourhood, I\r\nwas suddenly seized with an illness.  Most of my followers took it into\r\ntheir heads that it was the smallpox, and deserted me, with the\r\nexception of two Ojibbeways, who remained faithful and brought me to\r\nthis hut, of the existence of which they were aware, having received\r\ninstruction here when it was occupied by a missionary.  We found it in a\r\nvery dilapidated condition; but they repaired the roof and rendered it\r\nhabitable.  Had it not been for their care I should have died, and I am\r\nstill, as you see, hovering between life and death.  Don't let me detain\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nThe voice and language of the person whom we found in this deplorable\r\nstate convinced me that he was a gentleman.  I felt, however, unwilling\r\nto leave him longer under the care of the Indians, for I saw what he\r\nsaid about himself was too true, and I feared that even before we could\r\nreturn he might die.  I proposed leaving Robin with him, and Robin\r\nhimself said that he should very much like to remain; but then I\r\nrecollected that we should require four persons to carry Alick, and that\r\nhe could not be spared.\r\n\r\nThe sick man's eyes were again turned towards Robin as I spoke.\r\n\r\n\"Strange!\"  I heard him mutter to himself.  \"It must be but fancy,\r\nthough.\"\r\n\r\nI again expressed my regret that none of us could remain.\r\n\r\n\"I would not detain you,\" he answered.  \"Your companion requires\r\nprobably more care than I do.  I have only to lie here and suffer.  My\r\nmedicine-chest is well-nigh exhausted, and I must now trust to nature.\r\nFarewell!  I hope to see you all to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nHe spoke in the tone of a gentleman inviting a party of guests to his\r\nhouse.  We took our departure, and hurried back as fast as we could go.\r\nThe shades of evening were rapidly increasing; the cold was becoming\r\nintense.  We were not likely to lose our way, but that was possible, and\r\nthe consequences might be serious.\r\n\r\n\"There is something strange in the tone of his voice,\" observed Robin,\r\nas he walked by my side.  \"I could almost fancy that I had heard it\r\nbefore, and yet I don't remember ever seeing anybody like him.\"\r\n\r\nBefore I could answer, Robin had to fall behind me to follow in my\r\ntrail, and, indeed, we had to move too rapidly to allow of any\r\nconversation.  It was becoming darker and darker, and I anxiously looked\r\nout for the camp-fire, which I felt sure Martin would keep up to guide\r\nus on our way.  I should have been thankful could we have moved into\r\nwarm quarters that night, for I feared that Alick would suffer from the\r\ncold.\r\n\r\nIt was a great relief when I at length caught sight of a bright light\r\nbetween the trunks of the trees, as I knew that it must proceed from our\r\ncamp-fire.  We hurried on, and found Martin busily employed in cooking\r\nsupper.  He had made some soup for Alick.  I don't know what we should\r\nhave done without that old iron pot.  He had also lighted a small fire\r\nin the centre of our wigwam, which of course required constant\r\nattention, lest any sparks should reach the inflammable materials of\r\nwhich our habitation was composed.\r\n\r\n\"What news?\" asked Martin, looking up from his occupation.  \"Don't stop\r\nto tell me here--it's wonderfully cold; but go inside, and I'll come and\r\nhear all about it.  Pat, you carry the pot, and I'll bring in the roast.\r\nYou'll want some food, I suspect, after your expedition.\"\r\n\r\nWe followed his advice.  Pat took off the pot, and we were all soon\r\nseated round our wigwam with the entrance carefully closed.  Alick was\r\nof course much surprised to hear the account we gave him, and declared\r\nthat he should be perfectly ready to set off the next morning; he would\r\ngo on his own feet if he could, but if not he must ask us to carry him.\r\n\r\n\"Shure, it's not on your own feet you're going, Mister Alick,\" observed\r\nPat; \"we'll build you an illigant litther, and carry you on our four\r\nshoulders.\"\r\n\r\nAlick felt conscious that the journey would surpass his powers, and\r\nthanked Pat for his good intentions.  The Irishman, who was sincerely\r\nattached to my brother, proposed immediately setting to work to form a\r\nlitter, and in spite of the cold, as soon as supper was over he went out\r\nwith the axe on his shoulder; and, aided by the light of the fire, he\r\ncut two long saplings and several smaller pieces, with which he returned\r\nto the hut.\r\n\r\nBefore they lay down to sleep, he and Martin put together a litter well\r\nsuited for carrying Alick.  I was thankful the next morning to find my\r\nbrother so much better, and as soon as we had had some breakfast, having\r\nstretched one of the skins over the litter, we placed him on it,\r\ncovering him up carefully with the others.\r\n\r\nNot till we were about to start did we think of the danger to which our\r\ncamp would be exposed by being left without any protection.\r\n\r\n\"Shure, Bouncer will look afther that,\" said Pat.  \"Here, Bouncer, see\r\nthat not a wolf, or a grizzly, or an Indian, or any other brute comes to\r\nour camp till we are back again to carry off the things.\"\r\n\r\nThe dog clearly understood him, and set himself down at the entrance of\r\nour wigwam.  We then, taking up Alick, commenced our journey to the log\r\nhut.\r\n\r\nConsiderable as was the cold, the excursion we had to make kept us warm,\r\nand Alick, being well covered up, did not suffer from it.  We felt much\r\nanxiety as we approached our destination with regard to the sick\r\nstranger, and I was prepared as we got up to the door to hear the worst.\r\n\r\nI was greatly relieved when the Indian, appearing at the door, told us\r\nthat the gentleman was no worse.  Sitting up in his bunk, he welcomed us\r\nwith a languid smile, and begged that we would place Alick by his side\r\nnear the fire.\r\n\r\nWe had brought the iron pot at Martin's request, that he might make some\r\nsoup for the two invalids.\r\n\r\n\"We want you to assist in bringing our provisions from the camp,\" I\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! then let me attend to the soup,\" exclaimed Robin.  \"I don't want to\r\nshirk my duty.\"\r\n\r\nAs Martin was now perfectly recovered, he agreed to Robin's proposal.\r\n\r\n\"The lad will be able to attend to all our wants,\" remarked the sick\r\nman, who seemed pleased that Robin should remain.  He then turned to the\r\nOjibbeway, and desired him to accompany us, observing that Rabushway,\r\nthe other Indian, had gone out hunting in the morning, and would\r\nprobably not return till late.  Misticook, the Indian we found at the\r\nhut, expressed his readiness to accompany us, and he, Martin, Pat, and I\r\nset off at once for our camp.\r\n\r\nIn broad daylight the journey appeared much shorter than it had done the\r\nprevious evening.  As we got up to the camp, I examined it with no\r\nlittle anxiety, fearing that during our absence a prowling bear or band\r\nof more ferocious wolves might have broken into it, and carried off our\r\nprovisions, though I knew that Bouncer would have fought to the death\r\nbefore he allowed them to approach.  My fears were at an end when he\r\ncame rushing out with a cheerful bark to welcome us, wagging his tail\r\nand leaping up to assure us that all was safe.\r\n\r\nMartin and I at once began making up the packages to carry on our backs.\r\n\r\n\"That not do; I no carry these things,\" observed Misticook.\r\n\r\n\"Arrah! thin, why in the name of wonder did you come?\" exclaimed Pat.\r\n\r\n\"You see, I show better way,\" answered the Indian, and forthwith taking\r\nhis axe from his belt, he chopped two branches from a neighbouring tree,\r\nabout ten feet long, turning up at the ends.  He then adroitly secured\r\nseveral cross-pieces a little more than a foot long, and in a short time\r\nhad manufactured a rough sledge.  To this he lastly fastened some of the\r\nthongs which he had brought with him, to serve as traces.\r\n\r\n\"Now what you carry?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nWe showed him the packages we had done up.  Nearly as much again\r\nremained, for which we had intended to return.  He placed the whole of\r\nit on the sledge, securing it firmly.\r\n\r\n\"Now ready,\" he said, and started off.\r\n\r\nWe took a look round, to see that nothing was left behind, and then\r\nfollowed, but found it difficult to keep up with Misticook, who glanced\r\nround every now and then in triumph at us.\r\n\r\n\"I wish that we also had made a sledge,\" said Martin; \"we might have\r\nsaved ourselves a good deal of trouble.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, our pride would not allow us to give in, and we managed to\r\nreach the hut soon after the Indian.\r\n\r\nWe found Robin seated by the side of the sick man, who had fallen\r\nasleep.  Robin put up his finger as a sign to us not to make any noise.\r\nWe placed our packages with the other things already there, against the\r\nwalls, as well as those which had been brought on the sleigh.\r\n\r\nI then observed that there were a number of buffalo-robes and a small\r\ntent, and several other articles of traveller's gear.  Alick seemed much\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\n\"I shall be all to rights in a few days, I hope,\" he said; \"but I fear\r\nthat the days of the poor man there are numbered.  He has spoken but\r\nlittle during your absence though I remarked that his eyes were\r\ncontinually falling upon Robin as he moved about the hut.\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall see how he is when he awakes.  In the meantime, as you must be\r\nhungry, I advise you to take the food Robin has prepared.\"\r\n\r\nWe very gladly followed the advice, and then lay down to rest.\r\n\r\nIn the evening Rabushway, the other Ojibbeway, returned with a\r\nground-squirrel, the only animal he had shot; the previous day he had\r\nkilled nothing; he reported that game was very scarce.  Knowing that we\r\nwere coming to the hut, he expressed no surprise at seeing us.  He,\r\nhowever, did not look very well pleased.\r\n\r\n\"If you wish to live, you must go out and shoot,\" he observed, \"or else\r\nwe all starve.\"\r\n\r\n\"We will do what we can, depend on that,\" I answered; and Martin and I\r\nagreed to accompany him the next morning.\r\n\r\nThe sick man slept on and on, till at last I began to fear that he would\r\nnot awake.  At length, greatly to my relief, I heard him speaking to\r\nRobin, and I went up to the side of his bunk to inquire how he felt.\r\n\r\n\"As I have done for several days,\" he answered.\r\n\r\nRobin, who had gone to the fire, brought him some broth.\r\n\r\n\"This will restore your strength, sir,\" he said, \"for it has done Alick\r\nmuch good.\"\r\n\r\nThe sick man took it with a faint smile, for he doubted whether anything\r\nwould do him good.\r\n\r\n\"Your elder brother will, I hope, soon be well,\" he observed.  \"He only\r\nrequires food and rest.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is not my brother,\" answered Robin; on which, thinking it might\r\ninterest the sick man, he briefly described how he had been carried off\r\nby the Indians, and finally, having made his escape from them, been\r\nbrought to Fort Black.\r\n\r\nThe stranger was evidently listening with intense interest.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me, boy,\" he exclaimed, interrupting him--\"have you no\r\nrecollection of your parents?  What's your name?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes, indeed I have.  I remember them well--my father and mother, and\r\nmy sister Ella, and little brother Oliver.  My name is Robin Grey!\"\r\n\r\nAlmost before the words were out of his mouth, the sick man stretched\r\nout his arms, exclaiming--\r\n\r\n\"I thought it was so.  Come here, my boy.  I am your father.  Long and\r\nalmost hopelessly I have searched for you.\"\r\n\r\nRobin embraced his father.  \"O papa, I remember you now,\" he answered,\r\n\"though you look so ill and sad; but you must get well, you must not\r\ndie; and dear mamma and Ella and Oliver?\"\r\n\r\n\"They were quite well when I left them many months ago; though your poor\r\nmother has never ceased to mourn for your loss,\" answered Captain Grey.\r\n\"I could not bear to see her suffering, and year after year, since you\r\nwere lost, I have set off in search of you, returning home only when\r\ndriven back by the winter.  While I lay here I believed that I must\r\nabandon all hopes of restoring you to your mother's arms; and,\r\nungrateful as I was, a merciful Providence has brought you to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"O papa! papa!  I am so happy,\" cried Robin.  \"You must get well, and\r\nwe'll go back together to mamma and dear little Ella and Oliver.\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Grey smiled faintly.\r\n\r\n\"You must pray with me to God that He will restore me, for He alone has\r\nthe power,\" he answered; \"and we must never again mistrust His\r\nprovidence.\"\r\n\r\nThis unexpected meeting between Robin and his father gave us all sincere\r\npleasure, and made us acknowledge that our course had been directed by a\r\nSuperior Power.  I cannot but suppose that Robin's arrival at that very\r\nmoment had the effect of giving a turn to his father's complaint;\r\nthough, for several days, we perceived no change in him.\r\n\r\nAll we could see was that he was not worse.\r\n\r\nAlick rapidly recovered, and in the course of a week was on foot and\r\nable to face the wintry cold.\r\n\r\nA heavy fall of snow prevented us from leaving the hut, so we employed\r\nthe time in manufacturing snow-shoes, without which we saw that it would\r\nbe impossible to go in search of game.  On examining our store of\r\nprovisions, we found that unless we could kill some large game--either a\r\nbuffalo, a deer, or a bear--we should be compelled to trespass on\r\nCaptain Grey's stock.\r\n\r\nAlick and I discussed the matter when we were out together.\r\n\r\n\"I see no other alternative, should we fail to obtain an abundance of\r\nmeat, than to push on at once to Fort Ross,\" he observed.  \"You and I\r\nand Martin and Pat must go.  I shall be very sorry to part from Robin,\r\nbut we must, of course, leave him with his father, and endeavour as soon\r\nas possible to send them assistance.  I wish that we could find a doctor\r\nto send to them, for I fear that the captain will not recover without\r\nmedical aid.  As it is, should the two Ojibbeways be unsuccessful in\r\nhunting, they will be very hard pressed for food.\"\r\n\r\nI agreed in this with Alick, but I thought that Captain Grey would get\r\nwell in the course of time, without a doctor.  I hoped so, indeed, for\r\nthere was but little prospect of our finding one.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the weather cleared, Alick, Martin, and I set off on\r\nsnow-shoes with our guns, but returned without having seen even the\r\ntrace of an animal.  For three days in succession we went out, but came\r\nback as unsuccessful as at first.  We accordingly, as we had determined,\r\ntold Captain Grey of our proposal to start forthwith for Fort Ross.\r\n\r\nHe appeared to be very unwilling to let us go.\r\n\r\n\"I don't wish to detain you on my own account, though I shall be sorry\r\nto lose your society,\" he said, \"but Robin will be very solitary without\r\nyour companionship; and should death overtake me, I dread to think of\r\nthe situation the poor boy will be left in with these two Indians\r\nalone.\"\r\n\r\nWe endeavoured to raise the captain's spirits by promising to send him\r\naid, and pointing out to him that our plan was the best for all parties.\r\nWe at length succeeded, and as he consented to our proposal, we made\r\nimmediate preparations for our departure.  We first set to work to\r\nmanufacture fresh knapsacks, with one of which each of us was provided,\r\nas also fur coats and caps, that we might be enabled the better to\r\nwithstand the cold, to which we must inevitably be exposed.\r\n\r\nOur snow-shoes were strengthened for the long tramp we had in prospect.\r\nFortunately we found a sleigh in the hut, the wood of which was in good\r\ncondition.  It was simply a thin board, twelve feet long, twelve inches\r\nbroad, and turned up at one end, from the top of which end to the hinder\r\npart, two thin poles were fixed on either side for the purpose of\r\nfastening the thongs by which the baggage carried on it was to be\r\nsecured.\r\n\r\nWe also manufactured some harness from buffalo thongs for Bouncer, who\r\nwas destined to drag it.  Pat undertook to drag the sledge which\r\nMisticook had made to bring the provisions from our camp.  The captain\r\ninsisted that we should take the tent, as it was but small, and would\r\ngreatly contribute to our comfort; and he also gave us a further supply\r\nof powder and shot, of which we had run short.\r\n\r\nThe morning we had arranged to start arrived.  It was snowing, but not\r\nsufficiently heavy to delay us.  We had tried Bouncer twice before, and\r\nhe seemed fully to understand the duty required of him.  Pat, who was\r\nless accustomed to snow-shoes than the rest of us, practised himself\r\nfrequently, that he might perform the journey without any inconvenience.\r\nRobin had been too stoically brought up among the Indians to exhibit\r\nthe sorrow he felt at seeing us depart, but he was satisfied that it was\r\nhis duty to remain with his father.  After shaking us all by the hand,\r\nhe resumed his seat by the side of the captain, apparently being\r\nunwilling actually to witness our start.\r\n\r\nThe two Indians came out of the hut to give us their final advice as to\r\nhow, under various circumstances, we should act.  While Alick was\r\nsecuring the cargo of Bouncer's sleigh, and I held the brave dog, who\r\nonce having got on the harness, was eager to set out.  Pat led the way\r\nwith his sleigh to make a road, the direction we were to take having\r\nbefore been arranged.\r\n\r\n\"Good-bye! good-bye!\" we cried to the Indians, and away we started,\r\nMartin following Pat, while I went just ahead of Bouncer, and Alick\r\nbrought up the rear, It continued to snow harder than we liked, though\r\nas there was but little wind, we did not in consequence suffer.  Pat,\r\nwhose sleigh was but lightly laden, went on bravely, he having wisely\r\nplaced his knapsack and gun upon it.  We, having heavier weights to\r\ncarry, had at first some difficulty in keeping up with him; and as we\r\nwere compelled to proceed in Indian file, we could hold but little\r\nconversation with each other.\r\n\r\nBouncer needed no whip, but followed closely at my heels, assisted by\r\nAlick when any hill had to be surmounted.\r\n\r\nAt first we kept along the margin of the river; then having ascended the\r\nbank, we found ourselves on level ground, covered by an almost unbroken\r\nsheet of snow, here and there only a line of trees showing themselves\r\nabove the wide expanse of white.\r\n\r\nCaptain Grey had given Alick a compass, which much assisted us in\r\ndirecting our course.  The snow ceased about noon, and we halted in the\r\nopen plain, to enjoy what was decidedly a cold collation, for there was\r\nno wood to light a fire, and we did not think it worth while to unpack\r\nour sleigh to put up the tent.\r\n\r\nWe were more fortunate in the evening in reaching a thick grove,\r\nsheltered by which we encamped.  On Pat's sleigh were three short poles,\r\nover which the little tent was stretched.  It was large enough to allow\r\nus four, with Bouncer, to creep inside, while the sleighs were placed\r\none on one side and one on the other, to prevent the canvas from being\r\nblown away.\r\n\r\nWe made up our fire at a sufficient distance from the tent, to avoid the\r\nrisk of the flames catching it.\r\n\r\nCaptain Grey had supplied us with some tea and sugar, and I shall never\r\nforget how much we enjoyed the warm beverage, after our long tramp\r\nacross the snow.\r\n\r\nHaving taken a good meal, we all turned in, wrapped in our\r\nbuffalo-robes, knowing that Bouncer would warn us should any enemy\r\napproach.  The only enemies we had to dread were bears or wolves, and we\r\nshould not have objected to be visited by one of the former, provided we\r\nhad time to get a fair shot at it.\r\n\r\nNothing occurred that night to disturb our repose, and we arose in good\r\nspirits, anticipating a successful termination to our journey.  In the\r\nmorning the sky was clear, and the sun glanced brightly over the\r\nglittering sheet of snow.  It was perfectly calm, and we trudged on\r\ncheerfully, every now and then exchanging remarks with each other.  We\r\nhad been walking for some hours, and had agreed that it would soon be\r\ntime to stop for dinner, when Martin complained of a peculiar pricking\r\nin the eyelids.\r\n\r\n\"Shure, it's the same sort of thing I've been feeling,\" exclaimed Pat.\r\n\"It's mighty unpleasant, but I thought I'd say nothing about it.\"\r\n\r\nIt did not occur to me at the time that the symptoms were those which\r\nprecede snow-blindness, and Alick was too far behind to hear what was\r\nsaid.  I had found the glare of the sun unpleasant, and had drawn the\r\nfront of my cap somewhat over my eyes, which I kept partially closed,\r\nfixing them only on Martin's dark coat, which served to guide me.  It\r\nwas owing to this that I did not experience the sensations of which my\r\ncompanions complained.\r\n\r\nNothing more was said on the subject for some time, and Pat went forward\r\nat his usual pace.\r\n\r\nThe ground became at length rather more uneven than before, but Pat\r\nmanfully dragged forward his sleigh without complaining; and Alick, who,\r\nthough coming last, was really directing us like a helmsman at the\r\nwheel, seemed to consider that we were going right.\r\n\r\nPresently I heard a cry, and looking over Martin's shoulder, I saw Pat's\r\nlegs in the air, and the sleigh, the hinder part of which Martin had\r\njust caught hold of, tipping up, as if about to follow the Irishman down\r\nthe hollow into which it was evident he had fallen.  I sprang forward as\r\nfast as my snow-shoes would allow me, to catch hold of the sleigh, when\r\nwhat was my dismay to see Pat's feet disappear altogether beneath the\r\nsnow, his stifled cries alone reaching my ears.\r\n\r\n\"He has fallen into a deep pit, I fear,\" cried Martin.\r\n\r\n\"He'll be smothered if we don't dig him out quickly,\" I said.\r\n\r\nMartin and I, going ahead of the sleigh, hauled away at the traces which\r\nwere secured round Pat's body, but in our efforts to haul him out they\r\nbroke.  We became seriously alarmed, for the snow falling in completely\r\nconcealed Pat from sight.\r\n\r\nAlick, seeing what had happened, came hurrying up ahead of Bouncer, who\r\nsagaciously halted.  Every moment of delay was of consequence, but\r\nbefore we could do anything we had to take off our snow-shoes.  Alick\r\nthen holding on to the sledge, which we brought close to the side of the\r\npit, plunged into it, feeling with his hands in the hopes of catching\r\nhold of one of Pat's feet, while we shovelled away, lying flat with our\r\nheads and shoulders over the hollow, endeavouring to throw out the snow.\r\n\r\n\"I feel one of Pat's shoes!\" cried Alick at length.  \"Here is a foot!\r\nPass the broken trace down to me.\"\r\n\r\nWe did as he directed.  Presently we caught sight of another foot which\r\nwas still moving about, showing that the owner was not yet altogether\r\nsuffocated.\r\n\r\nI succeeded in getting hold of it.\r\n\r\n\"Now, haul away!\" cried Alick.  \"We mustn't mind how we get him out,\r\nprovided he comes out.\"\r\n\r\nWe pulled and pulled, the snow slipping in around us, and at length the\r\nIrishman's legs came into view, though, as Alick was on one side of the\r\nhole and I on the other, their owner must have suffered no little\r\ninconvenience and pain.  As soon, however, as Alick could get on firmer\r\nground, the body quickly followed, and at length we heard Pat's voice in\r\nsmothered tones exclaiming, \"Shure, if you pull my legs off, I'll niver\r\nbe able to walk again at all, at all!\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind your legs, if we can get your head out,\" answered Alick,\r\nlaughing.\r\n\r\nWe saw that Pat was not likely to be much the worse for the adventure,\r\nand in a few seconds we got him safe out of the hole, and in a few more\r\nhe was all to rights, and we helped him put on his snow-shoes, which\r\nwere fortunately not broken.  His cap had stuck to his head, and he had\r\nnot even lost his mitts.\r\n\r\n\"Bedad!  I thought I was niver going to stop till I got to the bottom of\r\nthe airth!  I'm mighty obliged to yese, for if ye hadn't caught me I\r\nshould have been going on still,\" said Pat, shaking the snow from his\r\nfur dress.\r\n\r\nWe again put on our snow-shoes, while Pat was knotting the traces.\r\nMaking a circuit to avoid the pit, which was of considerable extent, we\r\nproceeded as before.  We had gone two or three miles farther, and were\r\nnear a wood, when Pat cried out, \"For the life of me it's more than I\r\ncan do to see the way,\" and Martin confessed that he also had almost\r\nlost his sight.\r\n\r\nI told Alick what they said.\r\n\r\n\"It is snow-blindness,\" he answered--\"a serious matter.  We must camp\r\nwithout delay.  Do you go on, David, ahead of Pat, and show the way.\"\r\n\r\nI told Pat, who was stumbling on, to stop while I took the lead of the\r\ntrain.  He then easily followed, and Martin kept after his sledge.  We\r\nwent on in this way till we reached the wood for which I was steering.\r\n\r\nOn getting under its shelter we lost no time in putting up the tent, in\r\nwhich we immediately placed our two now perfectly blind companions.\r\nAlick and I had cause to be thankful that we had not suffered in the\r\nsame way.\r\n\r\nHow dreadful would have been our fate had the whole party been struck by\r\nsnow-blindness!\r\n\r\nAlick remembered to have heard that the only cure was to bathe the eyes\r\nin cold water, and to remain under shelter.  We might thus be delayed\r\nfor several days, but as we could not tell that we should not be\r\nattacked in the same way, we thought this better than attempting to\r\nreach Fort Ross without stopping.  We lighted a fire, and put some snow\r\ninto the pot to melt.  We had abundance of food for the journey, so that\r\nthe delay on that account was not of much consequence, though we might\r\nhave to go on short commons at the end of it.\r\n\r\nOur blind companions found great relief from bathing their eyes.  We had\r\nto take the pot again and again to the fire, as it rapidly cooled and\r\nbegan to freeze.  All arrangements having been made, Alick took his gun,\r\nand went out in the hopes of finding some game in the wood.  Late in the\r\nevening he returned without having shot anything.  Another whole day\r\npassed, and on the third, as Martin began to see a little, leaving\r\nBouncer to assist him in taking care of the camp, I accompanied Alick.\r\n\r\nWe had been out some hours when we caught sight of a small deer, to\r\nwhich we gave chase.  It kept a long way ahead of us, but we followed\r\nits trail, determined, at all costs, to have it.  It stopped several\r\ntimes, and at last, we having got within range, Alick was tempted to\r\nfire.\r\n\r\nHis shot took effect, but the deer bounded off, though we saw by the\r\ncrimson stains on the snow that it was severely wounded; still it kept\r\nahead of us, and disappeared behind a grove of larches.\r\n\r\nFeeling pretty sure that it would seek for shelter in the wood, and\r\nknowing that we could always trace it, as we were both weary of our long\r\nrun, we sat down for a few minutes to rest.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" cried Alick, \"well go and get the deer.\"\r\n\r\nAgain we started off, but had not gone many paces when we heard the\r\nfaint sounds of yelping and barking.  The trail was clear enough, but\r\nthe deer, though wounded, had evidently gone at a great pace.  In a\r\nshort time we discovered that the trail had been joined by that of\r\nseveral other animals coming from the right hand and the left, which we\r\nat once knew to be wolves.\r\n\r\n\"We shall lose our venison, I fear, if we don't make haste,\" said Alick.\r\n\r\nThe yelping and barking sounds increased in loudness, when we saw ahead\r\nof us, amid the snow, a flashing of tails and flying hair, and directly\r\nafterwards a dozen or more dark forms, all tugging and snarling and\r\noccasionally biting at each other, evidently employed in pulling away at\r\na body on the ground.\r\n\r\nThey were \"coyotes,\" or small prairie-wolves; but though small, they\r\nexhibit wonderful activity and power of swallowing.  By the time we got\r\nup to the brutes they had devoured every particle of the deer, and\r\nnothing remained but a well-picked skeleton, from which they slunk off\r\nwhen we were almost close enough to knock them over with the butts of\r\nour guns.  They were not worth shooting, so we let them go, and,\r\nbitterly disappointed, set off to return to our camp.  We had no\r\ndifficulty in finding our way, but it was trying to have lost our game\r\nafter so long a chase, especially as we greatly needed the venison both\r\nfor ourselves and Bouncer, who required to be well fed.\r\n\r\nThe next morning Pat, as well as Martin, had sufficiently recovered to\r\nset off again.  By Alick's advice we fastened some dark handkerchiefs\r\nover our faces, with two minute holes in them through which we could\r\nlook.  We could, however, see only directly before us, unless, we turned\r\nour heads.\r\n\r\nWe had been compelled to use up the greater portion of our food during\r\nthese four days' delay.  On the evening of the fifth day after leaving\r\nthe camp at which we had so long remained, we found ourselves\r\napproaching Fort Ross.\r\n\r\nAll our troubles, we hoped, would now be at an end.  We had exhausted\r\nthe remainder of our pemmican and dried meat at the last, meal we had\r\ntaken at noon, having given Bouncer a larger portion than usual.  That\r\ndid not matter.  We were about to be welcomed by our friends, and to\r\nenjoy an abundance.  We all felt hungry, and could not help talking of\r\nthe warm supper which would soon be placed before us.  We therefore\r\ntrudged cheerfully forward, Pat every now and then giving forth one of\r\nhis merry Irish songs.\r\n\r\nAt last the flanking towers of Fort Ross came into view through the dim\r\ntwilight, but no flag was flying, nor did we see anybody moving about.\r\n\r\n\"Of course they hauled down the flag at sunset,\" said Martin, \"but I\r\nwonder they didn't see us.  They would be sure to be keeping a lookout.\"\r\n\r\nAlick made no remark.  I expected every instant to see Mr Meredith or\r\nsome of the garrison come out to welcome us.\r\n\r\nThe gate was reached, but no one appeared.  We knocked and shouted, and\r\nBouncer barked.  No answer came, neither to his nor our calls.\r\n\r\n\"The fort is deserted!\"  I exclaimed.  \"What dreadful event can have\r\nhappened?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr Meredith for some reason or other was ordered to retire.  Had the\r\nIndians captured the fort, the gate would have been left open,\" observed\r\nAlick.\r\n\r\n\"The sooner we get in and ascertain what has occurred, the better,\" said\r\nMartin.\r\n\r\n\"Faix, thin, if you'll give me a lift I'll soon find out,\" said Pat,\r\ntaking off his snow-shoes.\r\n\r\nThe poles of the tent were placed against the gate, and with our help\r\nPat climbed them till he could reach the top with his hands, when,\r\ndrawing himself up, he got his head and shoulders over.\r\n\r\n\"Sorra a man do I see,\" he cried out, \"but, bedad, there's a black baste\r\nwaddling along on the opposite side.  There's another, and another.\r\nThey're bears, and seem to be the only garrison left in the place.  Just\r\nhand me up my gun, plase, for I should not like having them coming to\r\nturn me out without the manes of disputing the matther.\"\r\n\r\nWe handed Pat up his gun, when he immediately slipped down inside and\r\nmade haste to undo the fastenings of the gate.\r\n\r\nIt was opened, and we hurried in, dragging the sledges after us.  We\r\nloosened Bouncer, that he might be able to do battle should any of the\r\nbears venture to attack us.  They, however, the very moment we had\r\narrived, were, so it seemed to us, on the point of evacuating the fort,\r\nand the last of them must have climbed over the palisades while Pat was\r\nengaged in undoing the door.  We conjectured that their object in coming\r\nto the fort was to search for food.\r\n\r\nHaving entered, we again closed the door and took possession of one of\r\nthe rooms, in which was a large stove.  Fortunately there was a small\r\nstore of wood remaining, with which we lighted a fire, and had there\r\nbeen food we should have been perfectly comfortable.\r\n\r\nWhy our friends had deserted the fort it was difficult to determine.\r\n\r\nMartin thought that it was on account of want of provisions.  Alick held\r\nto the opinion that they were required to strengthen the garrison of\r\nsome more important fort.\r\n\r\nI suspected that Mr Meredith, having heard of the destruction of Fort\r\nBlack, and believing that Fort Ross would be attacked, and that he\r\npossessed inadequate means of defending it, had thought it prudent to\r\nretire to another post.\r\n\r\n\"Surely they would not have gone away without leaving some notice for us\r\nbehind them, even although they were unable to spare any provisions,\r\nshould we arrive here,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"They also probably believed that we were all destroyed,\" said Alick,\r\n\"and would not have thought about us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whether or not, gintlemen, I'll just take the liberty of hunting about,\r\nand seeing if I cannot ferret out some food or other,\" exclaimed Pat.\r\n\"If these bastes of bears haven't broken into the pantry, maybe there\r\nwill be a scrap of something or other to stay our stomachs.\"\r\n\r\nSaying this, Pat lighted the end of a piece of pinewood, and set off on\r\nhis search.  Though we had but little hope of finding anything eatable,\r\nwe followed his example, and searched in every nook and corner of the\r\nfort.\r\n\r\nNot a particle of food of any description could we find, which confirmed\r\nthe opinion Martin had expressed that our friends had been compelled to\r\ndesert the fort from the want of provisions.  Indeed, when I came to\r\nthink of the matter, I did not believe that Mr Meredith could have been\r\nfrightened away by fear of an attack from Indians.\r\n\r\nAs I was returning to the sitting-room across the square, the light from\r\nmy torch showed me a dark form creeping along near the stockade.  I felt\r\nsure that it was a bear which had not succeeded in making its escape.  I\r\nhurried in for my gun, which I had left in the room where Bouncer was\r\nlying down by the fire.  My companions were at the time in different\r\nparts of the fort.\r\n\r\nI was afraid of calling to them, for fear of frightening the bear; so,\r\ntaking my gun in one hand and the torch in the other, I crept forward in\r\nthe direction in which I had seen the animal.  Again I caught sight of\r\nhim attempting to climb up the palisade.\r\n\r\nI advanced a few steps.  Whether or not he saw me I could not tell.\r\nMarking well the spot, I dropped my torch, and raising my gun to my\r\nshoulder, fired.\r\n\r\nBy the faint light of the almost expiring torch I saw a huge body fall.\r\n\r\nThe report of the gun of course quickly brought out the rest of the\r\nparty, when, all of us hurrying forward, to our infinite satisfaction we\r\nsaw the bear on the ground struggling to get up.  My bullet had missed\r\nhis head, but broken his shoulder.  Alick and Martin immediately fired,\r\nand the bear's struggles ceased.\r\n\r\n\"Be aisy, gintlemen; he may not be dead afther all,\" cried Pat,\r\nadvancing cautiously with his torch.\r\n\r\nI reloaded my gun, in case Pat should be right in his conjecture; but\r\nthe bear gave no signs of life, and getting up to him we found that he\r\nwas quite dead.\r\n\r\nWe lost no time in skinning him, and as soon as we had done so Martin\r\ncut a few choice pieces out of the carcass, and hastened back with them\r\nto the fire, while we finished the operation.  He was a young animal,\r\nless active or sagacious than his companions.\r\n\r\nWe at once carried the meat and skin into the house, where Martin had\r\nsome steaks ready for us.  We lay down after supper with thankful hearts\r\nthat a supply of meat had been so providentially sent to us.\r\n\r\nBouncer had his share, and then composed himself to sleep near the door,\r\nwith one eye open ready to warn us of the approach of danger.\r\n\r\nFeeling sure that no unfriendly Indians were likely to be in the\r\nneighbourhood at that season of the year, we passed the night with a\r\nfeeling of perfect security.\r\n\r\nWe had now to determine what further course it would be best to pursue.\r\nThe meat of the young bear would last us for several days, and perhaps\r\nsome of its companions might return to the fort and allow themselves to\r\nbe shot; but the probability was, however, slight.  Finding that there\r\nwas no food and that the fort was garrisoned, they were not likely again\r\nto climb over the palisades.  Should they not do so we might, after all,\r\nbe very hard pressed for food.\r\n\r\n\"What do you say, lads, to pushing forward at once to the fort at\r\nTouchwood Hills?  The journey is a long one, but we are likely to find\r\ngame on the way; and if not, the flesh of this bear economised will last\r\nus till we get there,\" said Alick.\r\n\r\nThere were no dissentient voices.  We agreed, however, to rest that day\r\nand keep watch, on the possibility of another bear appearing.  None\r\ncame, and early in the morning we again plunged into the wilderness of\r\nsnow.\r\n\r\nFor two days we travelled on without any adventure, looking out for game\r\nas we had before done.  The second day we encamped rather earlier than\r\nusual, as we saw traces of several deer, which we resolved if possible\r\nto run down.\r\n\r\nHaving hurriedly pitched our tent near a small wood, Alick, Martin, and\r\nI started off, leaving Pat and Bouncer to guard the camp.  Pat had his\r\ngun ready, observing that perhaps a deer would come that way, and if so\r\nhe might hope to kill it.\r\n\r\nThough no deer were in sight, their tracks were unmistakable, and we\r\nwere tempted to go on farther from the camp than we had intended.  As\r\nthe sun set, the wind began to blow colder than before, and clouds to\r\ngather in the sky.  Alick exclaimed that we must return as fast as our\r\nlegs could carry us.\r\n\r\nBefore we had got far, down came the snow, and with good reason we began\r\nto fear that we should be unable to retrace our steps.  As long as we\r\nhad sufficient light Alick's compass guided us, and we had taken the\r\nlast glance at it, and were scarcely able to distinguish in what\r\ndirection the needle pointed, when we caught sight of the tent, and\r\nheard Pat's voice shouting loudly to us.\r\n\r\nWe hurried on, thankful that we had not been benighted; but Pat, instead\r\nof welcoming us, as we expected, stood in front of the tent wringing his\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter, Pat?\" asked Alick.\r\n\r\n\"Shure! matther enough, Misther Alick dear,\" he answered.  \"Just afther\r\nyou went away, Bouncer and I caught sight of a deer, far off over the\r\nsnow.  Says I to Bouncer, `We'll have that deer;' and off we set, making\r\nsure that we should come up to him before long.  Instead of stopping to\r\nbe shot, however, the baste took to its heels.  To make a long story\r\nshort, though we followed for many a mile, it got away afther all.  Now\r\ncomes the worst part of the business.  As we drew near to the tent I\r\nheard a loud yelling, and what should I see but a pack of hungry wolves\r\ntearing away at my sledge with all the bear's mate on it, and by the\r\ntime I got up not a scrap was left--bad luck to the bastes.  Och! shure,\r\nshure, what shall we be afther doing?\"\r\n\r\nWe cast blank looks at each other, and Bouncer hung down his head, as if\r\nhe had been the cause of our loss.  Alick could not blame Pat, though he\r\nregretted that he did not give him a strict charge on no account to\r\nleave the camp.\r\n\r\nAfter our long chase we were desperately hungry, but had not a morsel to\r\neat.  There was no use repining, however, and we hoped that we might\r\nhave better fortune the next day.\r\n\r\nSupperless we turned into our little tent, to try to overcome our hunger\r\nby sleep.  An occasional growl from Bouncer showed us that the wolves\r\nwere still near.\r\n\r\nAs we had no breakfast to cook, the next morning we started as soon as\r\nthere was daylight sufficient to enable us to pack up our tent.  Not a\r\ntrace of a deer did we see the next day; had any passed that way, the\r\nsnow must have obliterated their footmarks.\r\n\r\nThe second night was approaching, and we had no food.  We came to some\r\nhills with a grove of trees near a stream at their foot, but the stream\r\nwas frozen over, and the hills and trees covered thickly with snow.\r\n\r\nAs we were looking round for a spot on which to pitch our tent, we heard\r\nPat, who was at a little distance, shout out, \"Here's an Injin wigwam;\r\nmaybe the owner will give us some food.\"  On reaching it, however, we\r\nfound that the wigwam contained no inhabitants.  There were, however,\r\nseveral articles within, the household goods of a native--a pot, wallet,\r\nbasket, buffalo-robe, and other things.\r\n\r\nAt first we thought that the owner had gone out hunting, and would soon\r\nreturn, but on a further examination we were satisfied that it had been\r\ndeserted for several days, or perhaps weeks.  Too probably, the\r\nunfortunate man had lost his life, either killed by a bear or a human\r\nenemy, or, unable to obtain game, had perished from hunger.\r\n\r\nAlick suggested that the occupants might have died of some disease, and\r\nthat it would be prudent to pitch our tent and sleep in that, rather\r\nthan in the wigwam.\r\n\r\nHaving cut some wood, we lighted a fire and chopped up the thongs of\r\nPat's sledge to make some soup.  Though very unpalatable, it would serve\r\nto keep us alive; it, at all events, stopped the gnawings of hunger and\r\nenabled us to go to sleep.\r\n\r\nWe were awakened towards the morning by the howling of the wind amid the\r\nleafless trees and the falling of the snow from the branches.  Looking\r\nout of the tent, we could scarcely bear the chilling blast, which drove\r\nthe particles of snow like pins and needles into our faces much as\r\nspoondrift is driven from off the waves of the ocean.\r\n\r\nTo proceed on our journey was impossible.  We dared not even light a\r\nfire near the tent, lest it might be destroyed by the flames driven\r\nagainst it by any sudden change of wind.  All that day we sat helpless\r\nand disconsolate.  Martin, who had held out bravely hitherto, began to\r\ngive way.\r\n\r\n\"Oh!  I must have some food,\" he murmured, \"or I shall die.\"\r\n\r\nHe repeated this several times.\r\n\r\nAlick at length, seizing his gun, started up.  I thought he was going\r\nout in spite of the bitter weather to search for game, but I saw him put\r\nhis hand on Bouncer's head and lead him forth.\r\n\r\nHe had got a short distance from the tent when we overtook him.\r\n\r\n\"It must be done,\" he said; \"Bouncer must die.  I cannot sit by and see\r\nthat poor boy perish.  What should we say to his father and mother,\r\nshould we again meet them, or to Rose?\"\r\n\r\nI felt as he did, but, unwilling to see our noble and faithful dog put\r\nto death, I turned aside, expecting to hear the report of the gun, when\r\nPat stepped up.  \"Shure, Misther Alick, you would not be afther killing\r\nthe poor baste!\" he exclaimed.  \"Let us trust to Providence as\r\nheretofore.  We have not been deserted through all our throubles and\r\ndangers.  See now! what's that there?\" he suddenly exclaimed.  \"After\r\nit, Bouncer!\" and he and the dog started off over the snow.\r\n\r\nI turned on hearing his voice, and saw a small animal followed by a\r\nlarger, which I knew to be a fox.  The cunning animal, catching sight of\r\nus just before I fired, gave a sudden turn, and though my bullet knocked\r\noff the top of his brush, he was far away, hidden by some low bushes,\r\nbefore even Alick had seen him.\r\n\r\nA \"Hurrah!\" from Pat at the same instant reached my ears, and he came\r\nrunning back with Bouncer, who had caught the smaller animal.\r\n\r\nThe faithful dog at once surrendered his prize.  It was a\r\nground-squirrel which the fox had chased out of its winter nest.  We\r\nshould have been compelled to eat it raw had we not discovered a small\r\nopen spot among the trees where we could light a fire.\r\n\r\nSkinning the squirrel, we cut it up and put it into the pot to boil,\r\nwhile Bouncer had the head and skin for his share.  He looked very\r\ngrateful at being first served, but licked his chaps, as if he would\r\nhave been obliged to us for a larger meal.\r\n\r\nThat squirrel, I believe, saved Martin's life, and perhaps the lives of\r\nall of us.  We were sufficiently recovered the next morning, and the\r\nstorm having abated we again set out; for all of us suffered more from\r\nhunger than we had ever before done during our adventures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWELVE.\r\n\r\n\"TRIPE DE ROCHE\"--DESOLATION--PAT'S ENDURANCE--LEATHER SOUP--\"IT'S A\r\nCARIOLE; THERE'S ANOTHER AND ANOTHER\"--\"ALICK MCCLELLAN!

Often the ground was uneven; sometimes we had\r\nhills to ascend, and precipitous elopes to slide down, not knowing what\r\nmight be at the bottom; and then a wide plain to traverse, without a\r\ntree or a shrub to break its monotony or to assist us in directing our\r\ncourse.  Soon after we set out in the morning our eyebrows became\r\ncovered with frost, our caps froze to our brows, surrounded by a rim of\r\nicicles.  The fronts of our coats were fringed with similar ornaments;\r\neven our eyelashes were covered with our congealed breath.\r\n\r\nOn several occasions we had to camp that we might go in search of game;\r\nbut after many hours' toil we returned--on one occasion with a fox, on\r\nanother with a second ground-squirrel, and on two other days with a\r\nsingle hare.\r\n\r\nThe fox, though the least palatable, from being larger, lasted us longer\r\nthan the other animals, and afforded poor Bouncer an ample meal.\r\n\r\nWe had reason to be thankful at obtaining these supplies, or we should\r\notherwise have sunk down on the snow and perished; for even had we\r\nkilled our poor dog, as he was nothing but skin and bones his body would\r\nnot have long sustained us.  For two whole days we feasted on _tripe de\r\nroche_, which, when boiled in our kettle, afforded us the only vegetable\r\ndiet we had for a long time tasted.  A high ridge had to be crossed, and\r\nit cost us much trouble to reach the summit.  We had to take Bouncer out\r\nof the traces and drag up the sleigh ourselves.\r\n\r\nA dreary prospect met our view from thence.  Before us was a wide extent\r\nof country covered with its wintry clothing, its undulations reminding\r\nus of the ocean when the troubled waves begin to subside after a storm.\r\nHere and there a few leafless trees partially diversified the chilling\r\nscene, resembling the shattered masts of vessels which had suffered in\r\nthe conflict of waters.\r\n\r\nIn vain did we strain our eyes to catch a glimpse of anything of human\r\nor animal shape.  Neither did man, nor fowl, nor cattle, nor beast, nor\r\ncreeping thing meet our gaze.  Animated nature seemed to have abandoned\r\nthe dreary solitude, and silent desolation reigned around.  Yet this was\r\nthe region we had to cross for many days before we could reach our\r\ndestination.  I could not avoid asking myself, should any of us be able\r\nto endure the fatigue we must first undergo, or should we even obtain\r\nfood to support life?\r\n\r\nAlready we were greatly weakened, while Martin especially looked a\r\nphantom of his former self.  Alick, though only so lately recovered from\r\nhis severe illness, held out the best.  Pat never made a complaint,\r\nthough his wan cheek showed that famine was telling on him.  If I sucked\r\nin my cheeks, it felt as if my teeth would come through them, and my\r\nknees would often scarcely bear me.\r\n\r\nHitherto, except the lichen we had scraped from the rocks, we had had no\r\nfood that day, and we might be unable to obtain any before night.\r\n\r\n\"Come, lads; we must push on,\" cried Alick.  \"It won't do to be stopping\r\nhere doubting whether we shall be able to get over yonder country.  It\r\nhas to be done, and the sooner we do it the better.\"\r\n\r\nAllowing the sledge to go first, we all slid down the steep slope in a\r\nhalf-sitting posture, happily reaching the bottom without accident.\r\nHonest Bouncer then came up to be again harnessed, and we set off at our\r\nusual pace--trudge, trudge, trudge.  Hour after hour the click of the\r\nsnow-shoes sounded in our ears.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder how long a man can go without eating?\" asked Martin in a\r\ndoleful tone.\r\n\r\n\"It is possible to hold out for three days,\" answered Alick, \"and\r\nperhaps longer, though it would not be pleasant.  Don't you think of\r\ngiving in yet, Martin.  We shall have some fresh meat to-morrow, I dare\r\nsay, if we don't get it to-night; and, at all events, we can have some\r\nleather soup before we turn in.  We have a spare buffalo-robe or two to\r\neat up before we cry die!\"\r\n\r\nThat night all we had to sustain nature was the leather soup Alick spoke\r\nof, with the addition of some _tripe de roche_.  Next morning we\r\nbreakfasted on the same unsatisfactory materials.\r\n\r\nWe were still some days' journey from the fort, and for the last three\r\ndays not an animal had we seen.\r\n\r\nAlick again began to turn, I thought, wolfish eyes at Bouncer.  The poor\r\ndog walked on steadily dragging the sleigh, and looking up with an\r\naffectionate glance at our faces when any of us passed, happily\r\nunconscious of the fate threatening him.\r\n\r\nEven Pat was at length beginning to despair.  Alick cheered us on.  \"You\r\nmust not give in, boys; you must not give in,\" he exclaimed over and\r\nover again.\r\n\r\nI felt that his advice, though good, was impracticable.  The evening was\r\napproaching.  I could scarcely drag one foot after another.  We yet had\r\nsome distance to go before we could reach a valley which lay below us,\r\nwith a stream in summer flowing through it, and a grove of trees by its\r\nside.\r\n\r\nUnable longer to support myself, I sank down on my knees, my gun\r\ndropping to the ground.  My eyes were dimmed by my frozen eyelashes.\r\n\r\nAlick and Pat were assisting me to rise, when Martin, who was a little\r\nahead, exclaimed, \"I see something coming along the valley: it's a\r\ncariole.  There's another and another.\"\r\n\r\nI passed the cuff of my coat over my eyes.  My companions held up their\r\nhands and shouted at the top of their voices, Bouncer at the same time\r\nlifting up his head and barking with all his might, as if conscious of\r\nthe importance of being heard.\r\n\r\nThe carioles came on at full speed along the valley, their drivers\r\nrunning behind them.  There were twenty or thirty of them, each drawn by\r\neight or ten powerful dogs.  I could now see them clearly.\r\n\r\nThen came a number of baggage-sledges with more men on snow-shoes, all\r\nkeeping up the same steady pace.\r\n\r\nOur dread was that the travellers would pass without seeing us.  Who\r\nthey could be we could not tell, but they were evidently coming from the\r\ndirection of the place to which we were bound.  Again we shouted and\r\nwaved our hands, and then Alick bethought him of firing off his gun.  We\r\nall discharged ours, and presently we saw the leading sledge stop, the\r\ndriver making a signal to the one behind him.  It was passed along the\r\nline, and the whole train came to a halt.\r\n\r\n\"We are saved! we are saved!\" we cried in chorus.  The knowledge of this\r\nrestored our strength.\r\n\r\nI was helped up by my companions, and we all, straggling on, reached the\r\nbottom of the valley close to the leading sledge.\r\n\r\nA gentleman got out of it and came towards us.  We at once saw that he\r\nwas Mr Meredith, though he at first evidently did not recognise any of\r\nus.\r\n\r\n\"What!\" he exclaimed at length; \"Alick McClellan!--David! can it be\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\nHe pressed our hands.\r\n\r\n\"I little expected again to see you.--And Martin Crisp! can that be you?\r\nI know you now, though you look dreadfully pulled down.  There are\r\nthose behind to whom your appearance will give new life.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then have my father and mother escaped?\" exclaimed Martin, and he burst\r\ninto tears.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" answered Mr Meredith, \"I am thankful to say that they have, and\r\nare now returning with us to Fort Ross, on their way to their former\r\nstation.\"\r\n\r\nI cannot well describe the greetings we received from Rose and Letty,\r\nand indeed from all the party, with many of whom, besides Mr and Mrs\r\nCrisp, we were well acquainted.\r\n\r\nFortunately the train was not far from the spot selected for camping\r\nthat night, and several of the gentlemen insisted upon getting out of\r\ntheir carioles and letting us take their places, while they put on our\r\nsnow-shoes and ran by our sides.  Poor Pat was of course treated in the\r\nsame manner, and I took Bouncer in between my legs--the first time in\r\nhis life he had ever enjoyed the honour of being dragged by his\r\nfellow-creatures.\r\n\r\nThe camp was soon reached.  A party of men had gone on before to make\r\npreparations.  Tents had been put up for the ladies, lean-to's near the\r\nfires to shelter the gentlemen.\r\n\r\nAbundance of food was soon placed before us--soft bread, hot tea and\r\ncoffee.  Far gone as we were, we were not so far gone that we could not\r\nenjoy it.\r\n\r\nThe adventures of our friends were recounted.  Mr Meredith, though he\r\nhad heard that the Blackfeet intended to take the fort, would have\r\nremained to defend it had he not been compelled to quit it for want of\r\nprovisions.  He was now returning with reinforcements of men and an\r\nample supply of food; besides which he had a party of hunters with him,\r\nand he hoped to obtain an abundance of buffalo meat and venison.  So\r\nsecure did he feel that he was bringing back Rose and Letty and Mr and\r\nMrs Crisp.\r\n\r\nThe two young ladies allowed Alick and me to sit near them; and I am\r\ncompelled to confess, though I heard the sweet tones of their voices in\r\nmy ear, it was not long after supper when I found my head nodding, and\r\nthat the power to rouse myself had gone.  I sunk back fast asleep, and\r\nremember nothing more till, opening my eyes, instead of the fair\r\ncountenances of my young friends, I saw the well-bronzed visage of Sandy\r\nMcTavish bending over me.\r\n\r\n\"Vera glad to see you, faster David, though I am loath to rouse you from\r\nyour sleep; but the sleighs are harnessing, and the train will presently\r\nbe on the move.\"  Sandy, taking my hand as he spoke, helped me to rise.\r\nI felt extremely stiff, and my joints ached considerably.\r\n\r\nWhile I was drinking a tin of hot coffee which he had brought me, he\r\ntold me how he and one of his companions, after the canoe had been\r\nupset, had clung on under her with their heads just above water, as she\r\nfloated down the river, till at length, by great exertions, they had\r\nmanaged to direct her with their feet towards the shore.  Believing that\r\nPat was lost, they did not look for him, but, as soon as they had\r\nrecovered, pushed on for Fort Ross, which they reached almost dead with\r\nhunger, and were, of course, the first to announce the tidings of the\r\ndestruction of Fort Black.\r\n\r\nSandy had already found Pat, who had given him an account of our\r\nadventures.\r\n\r\nI told him how delighted I was, too, to find that he had escaped, as I\r\nhad given him up for lost.  He told me, almost with tears in his eyes,\r\nhow he had mourned for us, cut off, as he fancied, in our prime.\r\n\r\n\"But God is vera merciful,\" he said, \"and He has preserved you, I hope,\r\nto be good and useful men.\"\r\n\r\n\"He has indeed taught us to trust Him, for His arm alone could have\r\nsaved us from the many dangers to which we were exposed,\" I answered.\r\n\r\nWe had not much time, however, for conversation, and Sandy, who had\r\nundertaken to look after me, helped me into a sledge, which had been\r\nprepared, he said, for my use.\r\n\r\nHonest Bouncer, who had slept at the door of the tent, got in after me,\r\nseeming to consider that the place at my feet was his rightful position.\r\nThere was just time before starting to exchange greetings with the rest\r\nof the party, who were already in their carioles.\r\n\r\nI found that during the night four fresh carioles had been formed, and\r\nby taking a dog from one team and one or more from others, a sufficient\r\nnumber of animals had been procured to drag us.  Sandy, who drove my\r\nteam, gave me an account of the various events which had occurred, and\r\nof the grief our supposed loss had caused our friends.  \"The young\r\nladies,\" he said, \"he feared would never again have recovered their\r\nspirits, and it was only when some hope was expressed that we might have\r\nescaped that they at all brightened up.\"\r\n\r\nLetty afterwards told me, indeed, that she had never altogether\r\nabandoned hope.  \"I could not have borne it had I done so,\" she added.\r\n\r\nAfter the fatiguing way in which we had been accustomed to travel, it\r\nwas delightful to be drawn along at a rapid rate over the hard snow,\r\nwell wrapped up in buffalo-robes; with a piece of crape drawn over the\r\nface to shelter it from the icy blast when the wind blew strong, or to\r\nshield the eyes when the sun shone too brightly on the glittering sheet\r\nof white.\r\n\r\nThe cariole, such as I was now seated in, is a somewhat simple vehicle.\r\nIt is formed of a very thin board ten feet long and fourteen inches\r\nbroad, turned up at one end in the form of a half-circle.  To this board\r\na high cradle, like the body of a small carriage, is attached, about\r\neighteen inches from the end of the floor-board.  The framework is\r\ncovered with buffalo-skin parchment, and painted according to the taste\r\nof the builder.  The inside is lined with a blanket or buffalo-robe; and\r\nwhen the traveller is seated in it, with his legs stretched out at his\r\nease, he is only separated from the snow by the before-mentioned\r\nfloor-board.  Eight, twelve, or even more dogs form the team of a\r\ncariole, dragging it by long traces attached to collars which are\r\nornamented with bead-work and tassels, and a string of small bells,\r\nwhich emit a pleasant tinkling sound.\r\n\r\nThe driver runs behind the cariole, guiding it by means of a line\r\nfastened to the floor which projects behind the seat.\r\n\r\nWhen he gets tired of running, he stands on this projecting board; or\r\nshould there be any luggage, he sits on the top of it.\r\n\r\nWhen a new road is to be made--as was the case at the present--two or\r\nthree men on snow-shoes go ahead and beat down the snow, making the road\r\njust wide enough for the passage of a cariole.  The dogs seldom attempt\r\nto go off the track thus formed, though the first four or five teams\r\nhave the hardest work; after which the road becomes hard, and the rest\r\neasily follow.  It was curious to look forward and back at the long thin\r\nline, like some vast serpent moving over the snowy plain, following all\r\nthe windings of the pioneers ahead; and it was cheering to hear the\r\ntinkling sound of the bells, and the voices of the drivers as they urged\r\non the dogs.\r\n\r\nWhen we encamped for the night, a small tent for the ladies, and another\r\nfor two or three of the superior officers who required the luxury, were\r\npitched; fires were lighted as close to them as safety would allow, or\r\nsometimes one long fire at which the cooks at once commenced operations.\r\n\r\nSupper over, a short time was spent in conversation, and then all the\r\nparty except those on guard betook themselves to repose.  The greater\r\nnumber, who slept in the open air, rolled themselves up in their\r\nbuffalo-robes in two lines, one on each side of the fire, with their\r\nfeet towards it.  Most of the dogs in the meantime had scraped out for\r\nthemselves hollows in the snow, while others found out snug berths so\r\nclose to the fire that they ran no little danger of burning their fur.\r\n\r\nSuch was the scene which met my eyes just before I fell asleep, rolled\r\nup like the rest in buffalo-robes with a knapsack for my pillow, the\r\nsnow my couch, and the sky glittering brightly with countless stars\r\noverhead; and such was the scene which our camp presented night after\r\nnight.  We had got within three days' journey of our destination, when\r\nnumerous buffaloes were seen in the far distance; and as it was\r\nimportant to secure some fresh meat, Mr Meredith ordered a halt, that\r\nthe hunters might go in chase of the animals.  It was supposed that the\r\nbuffaloes were moving away to the westward, and that another opportunity\r\nof hunting them might not occur during the winter.\r\n\r\nA convenient place for a camp, in a hollow surrounded by trees, was\r\nchosen, and wigwams were put up for those who wished to remain in camp.\r\nThe larger number of the men, however, all of whom were accustomed to\r\nhunting, were eager to go in chase, so that comparatively few remained\r\nto guard the camp.\r\n\r\nI resolved to stay behind, both for the sake of enjoying the society of\r\nRose and Letty, as also because I had had hunting enough, and had\r\nscarcely yet sufficiently recovered to undergo the fatigue of a long run\r\nin snow-shoes.  Alick, though he had held out so well when leading our\r\nsmall party, had knocked up altogether when his responsibilities were\r\nover, and was unfit to exert himself in any way; all he could do,\r\nindeed, was to step into his cariole and be dragged along over the snow.\r\n\r\nMartin was very little better, and this was the first opportunity he had\r\nhad of spending any time with his parents, who were anxious to hear his\r\nadventures.  I had been seated with Rose and Letty before the camp-fire,\r\nwhen they proposed putting on their snow-shoes and walking to the top of\r\na slight elevation some distance off, from whence we fancied that a view\r\nmight be obtained of the herd of buffaloes.\r\n\r\nThe air was perfectly calm, the sky bright, and as a hard crust had\r\nformed over the snow, we found walking especially pleasant.  We went on\r\nand on, consequently, farther than we had intended, expecting every\r\ninstant to come in sight of the hunters and the shaggy monsters of which\r\nthey were in chase.\r\n\r\nThe ridge on the top of which we were walking was of no great height,\r\nand others somewhat more elevated intervened, we found, between us and\r\nthe plain on which the buffaloes had been seen.\r\n\r\nRose--who had been leading, while Letty and I walked alongside each\r\nother--at last proposed going back.  We--that is, Letty and I--had\r\nforgotten to watch the sun, which was already sinking rapidly towards\r\nthe horizon.  Just as we turned I caught sight of a number of dark\r\nobjects, moving quickly over the snow.  For a moment I thought they\r\nmight be the huntsmen, but I was soon convinced that they were wolves.\r\nI did not at first apprehend that they were coming towards us, but still\r\nI knew that it would be well to make our way back to camp as fast as\r\npossible.  I begged Rose and Letty to go forward while I kept watch on\r\nthe proceedings of the wolves.\r\n\r\nWe had not gone far when to my dismay I felt convinced that they were\r\nmaking towards us, and I could even hear the faint sounds of their\r\nyelping and barking coming up from the plain below us.\r\n\r\nI urged my companions to hasten on while I followed close behind them.\r\nI was in hopes that they were merely coyotes, which are cowardly\r\ncreatures; but as they got nearer I saw that they were the larger\r\nspecies of prairie wolf, too probably rendered savage by hunger.  I now\r\nbitterly regretted having allowed my young friends to go so far from the\r\ncamp.  We were still at too great a distance to make any signal for\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\nI knew that by running we should only encourage the wolves to pursue us,\r\nand therefore entreating the young ladies to stop, I placed myself\r\nbetween them and the yelping pack of brutes, who were now within twenty\r\nyards of us.\r\n\r\nThe brave girls not only did not continue running, but came up close\r\nbehind me--Rose placing herself directly in front of Letty, and holding\r\nher hands to her neck, knowing that they were too likely to spring at\r\nit.  I felt that I must make every effort to drive the brutes away.\r\n\r\nShouting at the top of my voice in order to scare them, I fired at the\r\nleader of the pack, and knocked it over; but before I could reload, the\r\nsavage animals were close upon me.\r\n\r\nTaking my gun by the barrel, I used it as a club and struck with it\r\nright and left.  My first blow beat down a wolf close to my feet, when\r\nits hungry companions immediately set upon it, and with fearful yelps\r\nand snarls began tearing it to pieces; but others still came on, gaunt,\r\nstarving animals, barking savagely.  Another wolf was on the point of\r\nspringing at my throat, when I happily struck that down also; but\r\nseveral were at the same time making at Rose and Letty.  My courage rose\r\nto desperation.  I must save them even though I were myself to perish;\r\nbut how could I hope to drive off the savage pack that came scampering\r\non, eager to tear us to pieces?\r\n\r\nThere must have been fifty or more of them.  Again and again as I struck\r\naround me I shouted with all my might.  A reply came from behind me.  It\r\nwas that of human voices.\r\n\r\nI heard a shot, and another wolf rolled over.  I dared not for a second\r\nlook round to ascertain who was coming to our relief.  Presently I heard\r\nBouncer's deep bark and the voices of several more people.  Other shots\r\nfollowed, and as the wolves fell their companions as before set upon\r\nthem, leaving only a few brutes for me to deal with; till Bouncer,\r\nseizing by the throat one of the most daring, who was in the act of\r\nleaping at Rose, pulled it down as a hound does a deer.  Sandy, Pat, and\r\nseveral of the hunting party now came up, and clubbing their guns,\r\nquickly laid low many more of the wolves, the remainder, panic-stricken,\r\nturning tail and galloping off at full speed.  Reloading, we fired at\r\nthe retreating pack, a number more of which fell over killed or went\r\nyelping away.  Thankful for our merciful deliverance, we returned to the\r\ncamp accompanied by our friends.  They had followed a buffalo, which\r\nthey had killed just below the ridge along which we had been walking\r\nwhen the wolves attacked us.\r\n\r\nMessengers arrived from the remainder of the hunting party, and sledges\r\nwere forthwith dispatched to bring in the meat of the animals they had\r\nkilled.  Another day was spent here, and the second hunting expedition\r\nwhich was sent out returned almost as successful as the first.\r\n\r\nWe then again moved forward and reached Fort Ross, without any further\r\nadventure worth recording.  The ladies performed the journey without\r\nhaving suffered any unusual fatigue.\r\n\r\nThe fort was uninjured, and had evidently not been visited except by\r\nbears, who had managed to break into one of the storerooms, but had got\r\nnothing for their pains.\r\n\r\nWe had not forgotten Captain Grey and our young friend Robin.  Mr\r\nCrisp, who had a good knowledge of medicine and surgery, at once\r\nvolunteered to go to his assistance; and Alick and I having organised a\r\nparty with four dog-sleighs, we set off, accompanied by the excellent\r\nmissionary.\r\n\r\nWe of course felt very anxious, remembering the precarious state in\r\nwhich we had left Captain Grey.  The first person we saw as we drew near\r\nthe hut was Robin, who had heard the sound of our sleigh-bells, and came\r\nrushing out to meet us.\r\n\r\n\"How is your father?\" was the first question we asked.\r\n\r\n\"He is still very low,\" answered Robin sadly; \"but if he had a doctor\r\nwho knew how to treat him, I think that he would soon get better.\"\r\n\r\n\"The doctor is here,\" I answered, pointing to Mr Crisp.\r\n\r\nRobin grasped his hand, exclaiming, \"Oh, do come and cure my father!\"\r\n\r\n\"God only can cure the ailments of the body, as He does those of the\r\nsoul, my boy.  I may prove, I trust, a humble instrument in His hands;\r\nbut I will exert all the skill I possess, and pray to Him for a blessing\r\non it.\"\r\n\r\nWe remained several days at the hut; and the good missionary ministered\r\nnot only, as he had promised, to the physical ailments of the sufferer,\r\nbut to his spiritual necessities likewise, pointing out to him the great\r\ntruth that though the all-pure God hates the sin He loves the sinner,\r\nand would have all men, though by nature His enemies, reconciled to Him,\r\naccording to His own appointed way, through simple faith in the\r\nall-perfect, all-sufficient atonement for sin which His dear Son Jesus\r\nChrist offered up on Calvary.\r\n\r\nThat truth, which I suspect had hitherto been rejected by Captain Grey,\r\ncame home with force to his heart, and I heard him say as he took Mr\r\nCrisp's hand, \"I believe!  I believe! and I pray that He will help my\r\nunbelief.\"\r\n\r\nIn a week from the time of our arrival Captain Grey was sufficiently\r\nrecovered to accompany us on our return to Fort Ross, where he was\r\nhospitably received by Mr Meredith, and carefully tended by Mrs Crisp,\r\nRose, and Letty.\r\n\r\nRobin won the affections of all our friends.\r\n\r\nReinforcements having arrived, a strong party was formed which, under\r\nAlick's command, was to rebuild and garrison Fort Black on the return of\r\nspring.  Before the snow had disappeared and sleigh-travelling had\r\nbecome impracticable, I was ordered to proceed to Fort Garry, when I was\r\naccompanied by my young friend Robin and his father, who was now\r\nperfectly restored to health.\r\n\r\nThe governor, who was then residing at the fort, made Captain Grey an\r\noffer to join the company; which he gladly accepted, provided time was\r\nallowed him to return to his wife and family and bring them up.  This\r\nrequest was willingly granted; and before I left Fort Garry, where I was\r\nengaged for some weeks, he returned, accompanied by his long-suffering\r\nwife and their three children.  I found that Robin had not overpraised\r\nhis sweet sister Ella or his little brother Oliver, who, however, by\r\nthis time had grown into a fine handsome boy.\r\n\r\nRobin had told his mother of our kindness to him, and she expressed her\r\ngratitude in a way which could not fail to give me very sincere\r\nsatisfaction.  \"And oh, how I long,\" she added, \"to thank that good\r\nmissionary, Mr Crisp, for the change he has been the means of working\r\nin my husband!\"\r\n\r\nWe all went back in the spring to Fort Ross, but Mr and Mrs Crisp had\r\nby that time returned to their distant station.  Martin, however,\r\nremained, having been appointed to a clerkship.  In a few years\r\nafterwards, when Alick married his sister, I became the husband of Letty\r\nMeredith.  He proposed and was accepted by Ella Grey.  Before white\r\nhairs sprinkled our brows we were all able to retire from the service,\r\nand to settle on adjacent farms in Canada, where we enjoyed the benefit\r\nof having Mr Crisp as minister of the district.
