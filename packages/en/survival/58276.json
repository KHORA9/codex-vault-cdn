HOOK.\r\n\r\n                        _Begonia xanthina_, HOOK, Bot. Mag. t. 4683.\r\n\r\nAlthough many different species of this valuable genus have been\r\ndiscovered up to this time, we have had only those with white or red\r\nflowers. B. cinnabarina with its orange red flowers was an approach to\r\nwhat we now figure—the Begonia xanthina. But even the yellow of this is\r\nshaded with the red which prevails in a greater or less degree in the\r\nflowers or leaves, and stalks of all the genus.\r\n\r\nThis species, which flowered in July, 1852, in the collection of Mr.\r\nNuttall, at Rainhill, Lincolnshire, was received by him in 1850, from the\r\nBootan Himalayas, having been sent thence by his nephew, Mr. Booth.\r\n\r\nIt may be some time before this beautiful plant is imported into this\r\ncountry; but we know that our enterprizing nurserymen and amateurs will\r\nobtain it as soon as it finds its way into the hands of the trade in\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY AND CULTIVATION.\r\n\r\nFew plants have a greater claim on the American plant grower than the\r\n_Begonia_. It has been too much the habit to sigh after, and bewail the\r\nwant of “Chiswick Heaths,” and other things which _do not_ do well in\r\nAmerica, to the manifest neglect of many beautiful things which _do_. It\r\nis time we had ceased to be the mere copyists of English horticulture.\r\nWe have so rapidly advanced, that we should aim at an independence that\r\ncan be achieved; and, as in government so in gardening, take our place\r\nas one of the horticultural “nations of the earth.” We have been a\r\n“colony of Chiswick and Edinboro,” “Paris and Ghent” hitherto; we have\r\nexperienced on every occasion slights and neglects; whatever we do is\r\npassed over in silence, and whatever we discover remains unnoticed or is\r\nscorned. These are some of our grievances. All our horticultural papers\r\nhave taken up the subject in turn, and pressed our claims on English\r\njournalists; but how have they been met? A private letter on the success\r\nof one individual plant has been published in one magazine; and two\r\nhybrid Peonys have been named in Belgium in honor of Americans. Perhaps\r\nonce a year a short extract in the _Revue horticole_ on _Forsythia\r\nviridissima_ from the _Horticulturist_; or, a notice in the _Gardener’s\r\nChronicle_ of how to preserve Tomatoes from _Hovey’s Magazine_. We must\r\nhave done with whining and complaining about these things. Let us strike\r\nout new courses for ourselves. We may never hope to excel them in Heaths,\r\nPansies, Calceolarias, or many other things, as a general rule, nor is it\r\ndesirable we should. Let them boast of their excellence; we will raise\r\nanother standard.\r\n\r\nThe BEGONIA is peculiarly adapted to become such a plant as I have\r\ndescribed. Requiring in England a moist and very artificial atmosphere,\r\nit does not make any very great progress in popular estimation. Here it\r\nthrives with very common care; all doing in a greenhouse 9 months in\r\nthe year; and many doing well in the open air, if in a somewhat shaded\r\nsituation. They are for the most part natives of Brazil or Mexico.\r\n\r\nTo cultivate them successfully we must divide them into two classes:—the\r\n_tuberous_ rooted, and the _shrubby_. Each of these will require separate\r\ntreatment. The following kinds are amongst the best in cultivation,\r\neither here, or in English gardens, from whence they can be easily\r\nprocured.\r\n\r\n\r\nTUBEROUS ROOTED.\r\n\r\n1. B. discolor or Evansiana, native of China, with pinkish white flowers,\r\nmay be had in bloom from May to October.\r\n\r\n2. cinnabarina, from Bolivia, deep pink or cinnabar, from June to October.\r\n\r\n3. Martiana, from Brazil, deep pinky rose, from July to October.\r\n\r\n4. diptera, Cape of Good Hope, whitish, June to August.\r\n\r\n5. Barkeri, Mexico, dull white, February to December.\r\n\r\nThese require to be kept rather dry and cool in the winter season. No. 5.\r\nmay be had in flower all the year, by having several pots, and keeping\r\nthem dry at different periods. Early in spring the tubers may be potted\r\nin 6 in. pots, in a soil composed of well-decayed leaf mould, loam, and\r\nsand. They require little water till the leaves appear, when they will\r\ntake an abundance. They may be forwarded in a little heat, but will do\r\npretty well if allowed to come along with the season. They are easily\r\npropagated from their tubers, by cuttings, or by seeds.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHRUBBY OR FIBROUS ROOTED.\r\n\r\n1. B. nitida, native of Jamaica, with pinkish white flowers, and large,\r\nthick, shining leaves. May be had in bloom all the year, and made into\r\nhandsome specimens.\r\n\r\n2. B. spathulata, another West Indian, with a very erect habit of growth.\r\nThe leaves are folded in like spoons, and the small white flowers appear\r\nat the ends of the young growth. It flowers from August to December, and\r\nis but an average kind.\r\n\r\n3. B. odorata, a Brazilian kind allied to the last, but has a fine\r\nfoliage, resembling nitida, the flowers came out like the last from\r\nAugust to December, are much larger and sweet scented.\r\n\r\n4. B. hirtella, a Brazilian species, with a rather starved looking habit\r\nof growth, but an abundance of small, pinky white flowers, appearing from\r\nJune to December.\r\n\r\n5. B. ulmifolia, a South American, with elm like leaves, but of no great\r\nbeauty of flower. Only desirable to form a collection.\r\n\r\n6. B. argyrostigma, a Brazilian species, with curiously spotted leaves,\r\nwhich is its chief attraction. The flowers appear from June to December.\r\nIt is a very strong grower—occupies much room.\r\n\r\n7. B. hydrocotylifolia, a Brazilian pretty species. It is herbaceous, or\r\nhas its leaves from a rhizoma creeping on the surface. Its pink flowers,\r\nborne on scapes about a foot high, appear from February to May.\r\n\r\n8. B. parvifolia, a native of the Cape of Good Hope. It has very small\r\nleaves, grows about 2 feet high, and is always in flower. A white\r\nflowering and desirable kind.\r\n\r\n9. B. albo-coccinea, a West Indian. Its oblique leaves are almost round,\r\nare very large and thick, and of a deep red beneath. The flowers appear\r\nfrom February to May; white on the inside, and scarlet on the back. The\r\nbest of the rhizoma producing kinds.\r\n\r\n10. B. nomonyma, a Brazilian species, in the way of B. manicata, with\r\nsmall white flowers, continuing from July to November.\r\n\r\n11. B. castaneæfolia. The specimens that I have seen growing are so like\r\nB. ulmifolia, that I have either not seen the true species or they are\r\nboth the same.\r\n\r\n12. B. Fischeri, a rather scarce Brazilian species, but one of the most\r\ndesirable, approaching B. incarnata. In the spring months it is covered\r\nwith its numerous pink or white flowers.\r\n\r\n13. B. incarnata, a South American, that should be No. 1 in all\r\ncollections. Its pink flowers may be had nearly all the year.\r\n\r\n14. B. coccinea, another first rate Brazilian. A strong grower, covered\r\nwith spikes of scarlet flowers from April to July.\r\n\r\n15. B. manicata, from Brazil. A fine species when well grown, though the\r\nindividual flowers are indifferent. The leaves are distinguished by a\r\nproduction resembling the claws of a mole on their under surface. Flowers\r\nin winter and spring.\r\n\r\n16. B. fuchsoides, a well known species from New Grenada, with fuchsia\r\nlike foliage, and scarlet flowers, appearing from June to September, a\r\nstrong grower and fine kind.\r\n\r\nThe species of this division are readily propagated from cuttings of\r\nthe half ripened wood, put in sand, and plunged in a slight bottom\r\nheat. They are liable to damp off if kept too close. Indeed if they are\r\nin a situation somewhat shaded they will do better without the usual\r\naccompaniment of a bell glass. They will grow well in a soil of sandy\r\nloam and leaf mould. They should never be grown in very large pots; or,\r\nin the language of gardeners, should be always under potted. When growing\r\nfast they take a good supply of moisture; love a moist atmosphere and\r\nfrequent applications of the syringe, and may be placed in the full\r\nlight. If a moist atmosphere cannot be maintained, they will do better in\r\na shaded part of the green house. The chief thing to guard against, is\r\ntheir damping off; small, well drained pots are the securities. When they\r\nare not growing they will live and do better with very little water. They\r\nare easily raised from seed, sown on the surface of the soil in pans, and\r\nplaced in a warm shaded place, with the only attention of never being\r\nallowed to get dry. Some fine varieties, I believe, have been lately\r\nraised by hybridizing in Europe. It opens a fine field.\r\n\r\nI think the remark of the Calendar writer in the last No. worthy of\r\nrepetition; that the Horticultural Society would do well to encourage the\r\ngrowth of the Begonia by a premium.\r\n\r\n                                                 A PHILADELPHIA GARDENER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AURICULA.\r\n\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\n\r\nAllow me to draw the attention of your readers to that much neglected\r\nbut truly desirable class of flowers the Auricula. There appears to be a\r\ngeneral idea prevailing amongst many persons that considerable difficulty\r\nis experienced in cultivating this lovely gem in our climate. This notion\r\nis certainly erroneous, and the object of the following remark is to\r\nshow how this may be accomplished. The Auricula, (Primula auricula,)\r\nis one of the very numerous species of Primrose, and no mean species\r\neither. Linnaeus claims this genus for Pentandria monogynia, and it\r\nforms the type of the natural order Primulaceæ. Our present subject is\r\nindigenous to the alpine districts of the European continent, Syria, and\r\noccasionally is found in the same situations in Britain, though rare. Its\r\nname Auricula has been applied from the supposed resemblance of the form\r\nof the leaves, to the ear of an animal, and hence the vulgar cognomen\r\n“Bear’s Ears,” a name somewhat revolting to the taste of some of our\r\ndelicate and sensitive belles, but quite in character with the quaint\r\nand uncouth, yet intelligent and enthusiastic class of individuals,\r\nwith whom it originated. In a wild state, the colours are yellow,\r\npurple, and variegated, and I am inclined to think, in opposition to the\r\nacknowledgement of some botanist, that two or three which are considered\r\nas distinct species, are nothing more than varieties of this, if so we\r\nmay include white also. Handsome as the different varieties of this\r\nflower appear naturally, the claim to beauty has been so much enhanced,\r\nby the perseverance and enthusiasm of the florist’s fostering care, for\r\nthe last three hundred years, that at length, it has assumed a perfect\r\nsymmetry of outline and marking, which renders it truly a gem. Were it\r\nonly for the peculiarly rich odor of the flowers, it deserves a place in\r\nevery garden, but when we combine this with the evergreen and neat habit\r\nof the plant, and the exquisite beauty of the flower, it seems strange as\r\nthe cultivation is so easy, that it is not more generally seen, even what\r\nis grown are mostly varieties of no pretension to perfection, but simply\r\na step or two removed from the natural state.\r\n\r\nThe Auricula is divided by florists into four classes, viz, green edged,\r\ngray edged, white edged, and selfs, the edged classes being mostly\r\nesteemed as exhibition flowers, although the selfs are tolerated and\r\nencouraged. There are also, several double varieties, but these are not\r\nconsidered equally valuable, yet they are well worthy of attention.\r\n\r\nThe following criteria constitute what is considered to be the main\r\npoints of excellence in a prize Auricula. The stem should be strong,\r\nerect, and high enough to raise the truss of flowers above the foliage.\r\nThe individual footstalk, sufficiently strong to support the flower, and\r\nof a proportional length to the number of pips, so that they may not\r\ncrowd each other, and which should not be less than seven in number, that\r\nthe truss may be close and compact, and form somewhat a half globe. The\r\ntube containing the anthers, the eye, and the exterior circle, ought to\r\nbe well proportioned, which will be the case if the diameter of the tube\r\nbe one part, the eye three, and the whole pip six or seven. If edged the\r\nmargin should be about equal with the next inner circle. The edges ought\r\nto be smooth, having no serrature, so as to appear starry, and the limb\r\nor upper surface, flat and even. The nearer the outline approaches to a\r\nperfect circle the better, although the very best flowers do not quite\r\ncome up to this point as yet. Whatever the colours, they should be clear,\r\nbold, and distinct, and divided in a perfect circle, or the dark markings\r\nform a circle next the eye, and extend out towards the outer rim on each\r\nlobe, so as to form so many half circles. In the selfs the colours ought\r\nto be uniform, bright and solid, or shaded off towards the outer margin\r\ndistinctly and clear.\r\n\r\nAround the cultivation of nature’s greatest beauties there is generally\r\na halo of mystery thrown. When any thing of this kind becomes recognized\r\nas a general favorite, speculative ideas, and vague theories have each\r\na portion of precedence, and as some of these peculiarities happen to\r\nsucceed, they are lauded, made public, and the tyro catches up the most\r\nridiculous notions. Our present subject has not entirely escaped from\r\nthis general contagion, for if we refer to some old and long established\r\ngrowers of the Auricula, we find that one thinks that the rotted down\r\nroots of the Willow, is the only matrix in which it will approach\r\nperfection; others again suppose, that nothing is so suitable as rushes\r\ndecomposed into mould, and a portion of the same material cut short\r\nin a fresh state, and strewed over the drainage; while some will not\r\nbelieve in any fertilizer, but blood, mixed up with maiden earth, and\r\nlaid together for a season. Now all these materials are well enough in\r\ntheir place for other things besides the Auricula, but to say that they\r\nare absolutely necessary, and that nothing else will produce the same\r\nquality, partakes of a superstitious and retrograde movement, and belongs\r\nto the old school. The fact is, all that is required, is a tolerably\r\nrich and cool base, for if too poor the plant will be weak and the\r\nflowers correspondingly so, and if too rich the trusses are apt to become\r\nmonstrosities, having irregular shaped flowers, and too crowded to form a\r\nhandsome bunch, with confused colours, and undefined markings. In these\r\nremarks, I would not wish to detract from the honor due to the old floral\r\nveterans, to whose zeal we owe a debt of gratitude, whose exertions have\r\nproduced many of the very best flowers, and without which we should have\r\nbeen minus of many classes of the greatest beauty. Still we must move\r\nahead we live in an age of progress, and if we cannot accomplish greater\r\nindividual perfection, we can certainly attain to the same by more simple\r\nmeans. To grow the Auricula, plant in a tolerably rich soil, a suitable\r\ncompost may be formed, by mixing two thirds fresh loam from a pasture,\r\nand one third cow dung, well rotted, and laid in a heap a few months\r\nbefore being used. Fresh dung injures the colours, and causes the plant\r\nto grow too rank and deficient in substance, when thin and papery flowers\r\nare the consequence.\r\n\r\nThe Auricula may be grown in pots, or planted out into frames, or the\r\nopen ground. If it is desirable to have a show of this flower in the\r\ngreenhouse or parlour window; about the middle of August, prepare a\r\nquantity of six inch pots, place in the bottom of each, about an inch of\r\nbroken crocks, or what is better the same depth of lumps of charcoal,\r\nover this put a layer of moss or fibry turf, to prevent the soil from\r\nfalling down amongst the drainage, next fill in a portion of the above\r\nmentioned compost, and place into the centre of each pot a good and\r\nstrong single crown. Before planting examine the roots and cut away any\r\ndecayed portions, spread them out carefully, and fill up to the rim with\r\nsoil, press it a little tight about the crown, and give the pot a smart\r\nrap or two upon the potting bench, which will settle all and leave a\r\nlittle space for future watering, do not plant too deep, but let the\r\ncollar of the plant be somewhat elevated, which will prevent damping off,\r\nafter potting give a good watering, but do not repeat this afterwards\r\nfurther, than to keep the plant in health, for the Auricula is impatient\r\nof too much moisture, and most particularly so while at rest in the\r\nwinter. In order to avoid continued saturation, the pots should be placed\r\nin a position where the water can pass away freely, and likewise shaded\r\nfrom the sun’s rays; if plunged in a bed of sand or porous ashes, so much\r\nthe better, and if worms should get into the pots, give it a soaking when\r\ndry with lime water, using the clear liquid; here they may remain till\r\nthe approach of severe weather, when the pots ought to be washed and the\r\nplants carefully looked over (all decayed leaves should be removed clean\r\naway,) when they may be taken into the greenhouse and placed near the\r\nglass, freely exposed to the air and light; water carefully and rather\r\nsparingly at first, afterwards gradually increase it, (but at no time\r\nunduly,) as they advance towards blooming; do not give much artificial\r\nheat, or the flowers will be rendered weak or abortive; a Camellia or\r\nGeranium house is quite hot enough, in which a temperature of 45 at night\r\nought to be kept.\r\n\r\nWhere there is not the luxury of a greenhouse, the same object may be\r\naccomplished by a common garden frame, (in fact a much better display to\r\nmy taste) and with much less trouble and expense considering the great\r\nnumber of plants that may grown. In this case, during the latter part of\r\nAugust, or early in September, place one or more frames, according to the\r\nnumber of plants, in a situation freely exposed to the sun, and upon a\r\nwell drained bottom, dig up the base so that the water may pass freely\r\nthrough, and fill in with about eight inches of the before mentioned\r\ncompost, divide the plants into single crowns, the same as recommended\r\nfor pots, and plant about six inches apart; if dry weather give a good\r\nwatering, and keep off the glass till frosty weather sets in, when the\r\nsashes may be put on, and air admitted freely through the day. In case\r\nof rain the lights may be tilted up at the back, which will keep the\r\nplants dry and prevent any danger from rot. Open early in the morning,\r\nand keep all at rest till towards the middle of January, when the lights\r\nmay be closed somewhat earlier in the evening, and the sun’s heat allowed\r\nmore freely: cover with straw mats or other material, to keep out the\r\nfrost, and line round the sides with rough litter or clean straw for the\r\nsame purpose. When the flower trusses commence to push, water may be\r\nmore freely given, but not overhead, unless in case of a genial showers,\r\nwhich seldom occurs at this time, and after the pips begin to expand,\r\ndo not let even the rain in upon them, as much of the fine powdery\r\nsubstance, which constitutes a great portion of their beauty, would be\r\nthereby washed off, but apply water more freely between the rows, admit\r\nair sufficient, but avoid beating winds. By following these directions,\r\nand having a good stock of plants, the lover of flowers may be rewarded\r\nthrough the months of March and April, without the aid of a greenhouse,\r\nwith one of the loveliest sights, and most enchanting scents in Flora’s\r\nkingdom. So far we have spoken of the little favorite as a nursling and\r\ntreasured up pet, but like many other of God’s blessings, it is not\r\nso very mindful of man’s fostering care. There are many of our city\r\nyards in which there is a shaded and sheltered spot, in all such there\r\nis ample accommodation for this plant; use a fertile and well drained\r\nsoil, screened from the burning orb of summer, and the thawing gleams of\r\nwinter, and we can be recompensed by a sight of its beauty, and refreshed\r\nby its delicious odor, without any other protection, although of course\r\nif protected and taken care of under glass, we have greater perfection,\r\nand shall be no losers for our extra trouble.\r\n\r\nAfter blooming is fairly over, choose a piece of ground sheltered from\r\nthe midday sun, if moist but yet drained, so much the better, plant out\r\nin rows a foot apart, and six inches in the row, place a little deeper\r\nthan before, which will cause them to push out side roots. If dry give\r\na good watering when planted and an occasional repetition, in case of\r\ndrought through the summer; no further care is required, unless Red\r\nSpider, or Aphides should attack, when a good syringing with soap-suds,\r\nwill speedily eradicate them.\r\n\r\nThe following list, containing twelve of the best in each class, is from\r\nthe authority of Mr. John Slater, one of the “Lancashire Heroes,” and a\r\nsure guide, a man whose enthusiasm knows no bounds, and whose honesty is\r\nequal to his perseverance.\r\n\r\n\r\nGREEN EDGED.\r\n\r\nLitton’s Imperator, Leed’s Colonel Taylor, Booth’s Freedom, Pollitt’s\r\nHighland Laddie, Ashton’s Prince of Wales, Pollitt’s Standard of England,\r\nYates’ Morris Green Hero, Oliver’s Lovely Ann, Barlow’s King, Howard’s\r\nNelson, Moore’s Jubilee, Page’s Champion.\r\n\r\n\r\nGREY EDGED.\r\n\r\nCheetham’s Lancashire Hero, Syke’s Complete, Kenyon’s Ringleader, Grimes’\r\nPrivateer, Fletcher’s Ne Plus Ultra, Fletcher’s Mary Ann, Waterhouse’s\r\nConqueror of Europe, Rider’s Waterloo, Kent’s Queen Victoria, Taylor’s\r\nPlough Boy, Beeston’s Fair Flora, Ashworth’s Newton Hero.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHITE EDGED.\r\n\r\nTaylor’s Favorite, Lee’s Venus, Ashworth’s Regular, Taylor’s\r\nIncomparable, Taylor’s Glory, Wood’s Delight, Catharina, Popplewell’s\r\nConqueror, Kenyon’s Lord Chancellor, Hepworth’s True Briton, Cheetham’s\r\nCountess of Wilton, Pott’s Regulator.\r\n\r\n\r\nSELFS.\r\n\r\nNetherwood’s Othello, Kay’s Jupiter, Blegg’s Blue Bonnet, Berry’s Lord\r\nPrimate, Berry’s Lord Lee, Grimes’ Flora’s Flag, Redmayne’s Metropolitan,\r\nSchole’s Ned Lud, Whittaker’s True Blue, Bradshaw’s Tidy, Barker’s\r\nNonsuch, Gorton’s Stadtholder.\r\n\r\nYours Most Respectfully,\r\n\r\n                                                   WILLIAM CHORLTON,\r\n                                           _New Brighton, Staten Island_.\r\n\r\nJune 27, 1853.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGARDENS OF PAEONIA MOUTAN IN CHINA.\r\n\r\nBY R. FORTUNE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese gardens are situated near the village of Fa-who, about 5 or 6 miles\r\nwest from Shanghae, in the midst of a vast country of cotton plantations.\r\nOn the way I met a large number of _coolies_ each carry two baskets\r\nof Moutan-paeonies in full flower; they went to sell them in market.\r\nArrived at the gardens I found there a number of these plants in flower\r\nand of a remarkable beauty. The purple and lilac species especially\r\nattracted the sight: among others a very pretty kind apparently distinct,\r\nwith finely cut leaves and flowers of a velvety purple, like the Tuscany\r\nrose of our gardens. The Chinese call it Moutan Peony (black) and I\r\nbelieve it to be the same as that called _atro-sanguinea_ by Dr. Lindley,\r\nin the journal of the Horticultural Society of London. Another species\r\ncalled “tse” or purple, had double flowers of a remarkable size; it is\r\nprobably this variety which they say has a thousand petals, and did not\r\nexist but in the garden of the emperor. The third kind is called “lan”\r\n(blue;) it is a lilac variety; its flowers are of the color of Wistaria\r\nSinensis. There are besides other kinds of purple differently shaded,\r\nvery distinct from the preceding and equally beautiful.\r\n\r\nThe double whites are also numerous and very remarkable. The largest\r\namong them has been called _P. globosa_ by Dr. Lindley, but there are 4\r\nor 5 others which approach very near to this. Some have a light shade\r\nof lilac, which gives tone to their color. The best is that called\r\n“wang” (yellow) by the Chinese; this variety, of a straw color, is very\r\nbeautiful, but notwithstanding inferior to some others.\r\n\r\nThe red peonies (Hong) are equally numerous. What is strange, is, that\r\nthe kinds common at Canton and in England, are very rare here. These\r\ngardens contain about a half-dozen of new varieties of red peonies; among\r\nothers, that called “Van-yang-hong” by the Chinese, is the most beautiful\r\nplant which I have ever seen. Its flowers are of a bright and pure red,\r\nentirely different from all the others perfectly double; each of them is\r\nabout ten inches in diameter. In all I counted nearly thirty distinct\r\nvarieties in these gardens.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of these beautiful varieties of Paeonia Moutan are\r\nunknown at Canton. This may seem strange in a country where flowers\r\nare so generally sought for; but the Chinese are in everything such\r\nconservatives that a slight acquaintance with their customs will suffice\r\nto explain this apparent anomaly. The gardens of Canton derive their\r\nsupplies of P. Moutan from a district situated more in the west than\r\nShanghae. From time immemorial the same gardens have furnished these\r\nflowers; they arrive always by the same road, and at the same time of the\r\nyear. It seems that Shanghae until the end of the last war, has never\r\nbeen in communication with Canton, at least in what concerns flowers,\r\nconsequently these beautiful varieties of Peony could not obtain a route\r\ntowards the south and thence to Europe.\r\n\r\nThe establishments where they cultivate exclusively the Paeonia Moutan\r\nare numerous, but very small. They have the appearance of our cottage\r\ngardens, and are cared for in the same way, that is, by all the members\r\nof the family: the women take as much part in it as the men: they are\r\nvery avaricious and love money extremely. When they have been consulted,\r\nI always had to pay dearer for the acquisitions of plants which I\r\nmade. The soil of these gardens is rich and well-manured; this latter\r\ncircumstance renders it less compact than the soil where they cultivate\r\ncotton.\r\n\r\nThe propagation and management of the Paeonia Moutan seems to have been\r\nperfectly understood by the Chinese at Shanghae, much better than with\r\nus. Our horticulturists complain without ceasing of the difficulty of\r\nmultiplying this beautiful plant, and this makes the price remain high.\r\nHere is the method which the Chinese pursue, and which our growers may\r\ntry.\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of October, they collect in the sheds and out-houses\r\na great quantity of the roots of a certain herbaceous Peony, roots which\r\nmust serve for subjects of Paeonia Moutan. The bundle of tubercles which\r\nforms the root of a herbaceous peony is divided, and each little root, in\r\nshape of a finger, becomes a subject upon which they graft the P. Moutan.\r\nHaving placed a great number of these tubercles upon the potting table,\r\nthey bring the grafts of the plants which they wish to multiply. Each\r\ngraft is but an inch and a half to two inches long; it is the extremity\r\nof a shoot made during the summer just finished. The under part of it is\r\ncut into a wedge and inserted on the top of the finger shaped tubercle\r\nof which we spoke. The graft is covered by a ligature or by clay and the\r\noperation is complete. A great number of grafts being thus made, they\r\nare carried to the garden and planted in rows distant about a foot and a\r\nhalf; the same space is left between plants in the same row. In planting,\r\nthe head of the graft only remains above the soil; the part where the\r\ngraft unites with the tubercle is always buried. Kaempfer says that the\r\nChinese multiply the Moutan Peony by bud-grafting; this is an error, this\r\nprocess is never practiced by them, they do not even understand it. The\r\nauthor has been led into the error by the smallness of the bud which they\r\nuse, this having but one eye at its end.\r\n\r\nEach autumn sees thousands of plants grafted in this way. The little\r\nempty space which may be seen in the rows proves the goodness of the\r\nmethod; in fact a graft rarely fails to grow. At the end of about fifteen\r\ndays the union of the root and the graft is complete: in the following\r\nspring the plants are beautiful and vigorous. They generally flower\r\nthe first spring or at the latest in the second; it is then that they\r\nare taken up and carried to be sold in the market in the way I have\r\ndescribed. The plant which has but one stalk and one flower has more\r\nvalue in the eyes of the cultivator at Shanghae than a stronger one;\r\nit is sold more easily, produces a very large flower, and presents no\r\ndifficulty neither for lifting nor for transportation. Thanks to this\r\ncircumstance I could always procure strong plants more advantageously\r\nthan small ones.\r\n\r\nIn the gardens of the mandarins can often be met Peonies of a\r\nconsiderable size. Near Shanghae there is one which annually produces\r\n3 to 400 flowers. The proprietor takes as much care of it as could the\r\nmost enthusiastic amateur of his tulips. During its flowering, it was\r\nprotected from the burning rays of the sun by a tent of canvass; in\r\nfront was a seat where the visitor enjoyed in full the sight of these\r\nmagnificent flowers. Every day, for several hours, the old man installed\r\nhimself there, and while pipes and bowls of tea succeeded each other\r\nhe looked lovingly upon his favorite “Moutan wha.” It was certainly a\r\nnoble plant, well worthy of the admiration of the old amateur, to whom I\r\nwish the pleasure of sitting a long time yet under his tent, to enjoy so\r\nbeautiful a sight.\r\n\r\n_Translated from the Flore des Serres._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHINESE PRIMROSE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWinter flowering plants are not too plentiful, at least such as will\r\nbloom in the cool temperature of a greenhouse; we have many fine winter\r\nflowering exotics, but they either require a hothouse temperature to\r\nbloom freely, or are more difficult to manage during summer; we are\r\nindebted to the Celestials for many of our most valuable winter flowers,\r\nAzaleas, Camellias and among others that beautiful little gem the Chinese\r\nprimrose. They are all of hardy and robust habit, and are thus within\r\nthe reach of all, so far as cultivation is concerned, a recommendation\r\nof much importance to those amateurs who cannot devote much time to\r\ntheir collection. It has often occurred to me when visiting amateurs’\r\ngreenhouses, that they would derive much more pleasure from their labors\r\nwere they more select in the choice of their plants, choosing those\r\nonly of known hardy and free blooming qualities, instead of aiming at a\r\nvaried assortment, often expensive, and rarely satisfactory. I was more\r\ndeeply impressed with this fact during a visit to an enthusiastic amateur\r\nlast winter. On entering his greenhouse I was struck with the gay and\r\ncheerful appearance it presented, and it was only when about leaving that\r\nI observed the only plants in flower were a few Camellias, two or three\r\nCinnerarias, and a quantity of Primulas of various colors, but these were\r\nso well arranged and set off with a profusion of healthy foliage, and the\r\nPrimroses showing such fine rounded trusses, that I am confident not one\r\nperson in ten would have noticed this simplicity of its production.\r\n\r\nAlthough this plant is very hardy, I am aware that many amateurs are\r\nnot so successful with it as they would wish. This, I presume, arises\r\nprincipally from its liability to decay if kept too damp at root, either\r\nfrom using pots of a large size, or supplying water too freely. Four and\r\nsix inch pots will be found of ample size, not that a plant will not grow\r\nin a pot three feet in diameter as well as it would in one inches. The\r\nonly difference would be that, in the former, the plant would probably\r\nrequire water once a month and the latter daily.\r\n\r\nTo keep up a succession of flowers for four or five months, seed should\r\nbe put in at intervals of five or six weeks, from June to September,\r\nsoil of a sandy nature should be prepared, and the seeds very slightly\r\ncovered. The front shelf in the greenhouse will be a suitable place for\r\nthem while growing, they should be encouraged by transplanting into a\r\nshallow box as soon as the first true leaf makes its appearance. If\r\nthinly planted (not closer than three inches) they can remain until\r\nsufficiently strong to be placed at once into flowering pots. These must\r\nbe well drained by placing a handful of broken material in each pot.\r\nIf attention is paid to this, there will be little fear of damp, if\r\nordinary care is given in watering. Two small stakes should be inserted\r\none each side of the plant, crossing other at top, no tying will be\r\nnecessary, this will prevent them from toppling over and breaking off\r\nat the neck where they are very weak. A few of the latest sowing should\r\nbe set apart for seedling. A little care and attention should be given\r\nto their selection, choosing those with large, well colored fringed\r\nflowers. Sometimes they incline to be semi-double; these should have\r\nthe preference. About the middle of May they should be set out in the\r\nsun, watered regularly, and if they receive an occasional application\r\nof manure water the value of the seed will be enhanced. Under these\r\nconditions an abundance of seed will be secured. It is not worth trouble\r\nto preserve old plants; young ones flowering with much more vigour; any\r\nparticularly fine variety, however, may be turned out of the pot after\r\nit has done blooming, some of the old soil removed and replaced in fresh\r\ncompost. The double varieties are much superior to the single ones. They\r\nare increased by dividing the plant into cuttings. To propagate them\r\nrequires a cool dry situation, partially shaded, paying great attention\r\nin watering, they must be kept rather dry until they begin to show\r\nsymptoms of growth; otherwise they are certain to decay. It is probably\r\non this account that they are not so extensively cultivated as they\r\ndeserve to be.\r\n\r\n                                                                   DELTA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE DOUBLE CHINESE PRIMROSE.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the Editor of the Florist, Sir: As you invite communications from\r\npractical gardeners, I offer a few remarks on the above; as I think it\r\na much rarer plant than it ought to be—few plants excel it in simple\r\nbeauty, and by proper management it may be had in bloom every month in\r\nthe year. Being double, it can only be propagated by cuttings, which may\r\nbe taken off at any time, and readily struck in sand under a bell glass.\r\nIn about three weeks they are sufficiently rooted to pot into single\r\npots. I find them to thrive best in a compost of rough leaf mould and\r\nsandy loam, in well drained pots. I repot them as often as they become\r\nwell rooted; and pinch off every flower stalk that appears till the\r\nplant is six months old at least. I then let it flower on, and as each\r\nflower truss shows symptoms of withering, pluck it out. By this course\r\nit will continue to flower a whole year. They frequently die out from\r\nexhaustion at this time, and the only way I find to prevent this, is\r\nto divide the plant into off-sets, and so start with them as with new\r\nplants. They always do well with me by this treatment. The double white\r\nis the commonest and most easy to be procured; but I have observed in a\r\nreport of the Pennsylvania Society, that the purple exists also in your\r\nneighborhood.\r\n\r\nIf you think the above worthy of insertion in the Florist, I should be\r\nhappy to send you some others when I have leisure.\r\n\r\n                                                      Yours, &c., HORTUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES ON ROSE CULTURE, BY A LOVER OF ROSES. (Continued.)\r\n\r\n\r\nHYBRID PERPETUAL OR REMONTANT ROSES.—This division of the Rose was\r\nintroduced to us about 15 or 16 years ago and according to the opinions\r\nof good judges it originated between the perpetual Rose Du Roi and the\r\nBourbon Rose; they have been till very recently nearly all of a crimson\r\nor dark red color. Florists and Rose-growers generally esteem these\r\nthe finest of all Roses, to which I would coincide, provided, they\r\nwere constant monthly bloomers, which they are not, giving only two\r\nor perhaps faintly a third bloom with a meagre flower in the autumnal\r\nmonths. They richly deserve special attention for their fine bold\r\nflowers, rich foliage, and luxuriant shoots when on their own roots; or\r\nif budded they make very admired standard Rose trees. But oh! what nicety\r\nof eye, how critical the judgment to detect the difference of one half of\r\nthem. For my own pleasure and gratification I would not give a groschen\r\nfor ¾ths of them; but we are so led off our guard by “have you got so and\r\nso,” we blush to own up, and buy nearly all, good, bad, and indifferent;\r\nbut pray who would grow Doctor Marx, Dr. Margolin, Madam Laffay, and\r\nnearly 50 others; all red, rosy red, dark red, light crimson, and such\r\ntranspositions, meaning nearly the same in color and character? So be it.\r\nI will not detail before your thousands of readers such equivocal terms,\r\nbut give off hand and full in my eye, a score that will please the most\r\nfastidious.\r\n\r\nAuguste Mie, clear waxy rose, cupped petals.\r\n\r\nBaronne Hallez, dark purple crimson, fine form.\r\n\r\nBaronne Prevost, rose color, very large.\r\n\r\nCaroline de Sansal, large, rosy blush, pink centre, of remarkably strong\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\nDuchesse de Montpensier, pale satiny rose, very fragrant.\r\n\r\nGiant of the Battle, nearly bright scarlet. Is this not the rose of the\r\ngroup? Everyone of your readers that wishes a rose bush that is perfectly\r\nhardy, bright in color, and constant in bloom may chose this subject.\r\n\r\nJulie de Krudner, a new rose, nearly white, very double, and agreeably\r\nfragrant.\r\n\r\nLa Reine. I hesitate about this though a most superb flower; it has a\r\npaucity of bloom not altogether to my fancy; the color too is undecided\r\nbeing a rosy lilac, but extremely large and luxuriant in growth.\r\n\r\nLion des Combats, reddish crimson, shaded with scarlet, large, full, and\r\nfragrant.\r\n\r\nLouise Le Clerc, delicate blush, perfect form, very profuse and fragrant.\r\n\r\nMadam Laffay, purplish lilac, inclining to crimson, very full regular\r\nflower, plant of strong growth.\r\n\r\nMadam Rives, quite a new variety, of a pale flesh or silvery blush color,\r\nof great substance, very distinct and perfectly formed.\r\n\r\nMarquis Boccella, pale blush, dwarf habit, a constant bloomer, very\r\ndistinct.\r\n\r\nPius 9th, crimson purple, very large, full and perfect, a profuse bloomer\r\nof strong growth.\r\n\r\nPatenotte, pale rose, very exquisite form, fragrant and profuse, quite a\r\nnew variety.\r\n\r\nQueen Victoria, (Paul’s) blush white, shaded with pink or peach blossom\r\ncolor, large, very full, and distinct from any other variety, quite new,\r\nvery desirable.\r\n\r\nRobin Hood, bright carmine, beautifully globular, and a rampant grower.\r\n\r\nWilliam Griffith, satiny rose, distinct color, a large bold petaled\r\nflower, quite new, and will rank amongst the best.\r\n\r\nWilliam Jesse, a favorite variety of a rosy crimson color, edged with\r\nlilac, very large, full, and constant.\r\n\r\nYolande d’Arragon, pale rose, producing its flowers in clusters the whole\r\nseason, a strong grower. Sydonie, a newer variety, is very like this, and\r\nI am doubtful if it is any improvement upon it, unless to a very critical\r\nobserver.\r\n\r\nI have not seen a clear good white as yet in this group. Florists\r\nand catalogues tell us of Blanche Vibert—white it is, but a sickly\r\nlooking flower and plant, at the best. Blanche Portemer has nothing\r\nmore attractive about it. A good white such as the old Madam Hardy is\r\nmuch wanted, it would be a treasure. There are over 100 of these Hybrid\r\nPerpetual varieties cultivated, one half of them are nearly facsimiles of\r\neach other. They all require more stimulation in their culture than any\r\nother roses; if a strong luxuriant growth is not produced a very meagre\r\nshow will follow; dark rich green foliage and strong shoots will produce\r\na corresponding bloom—but yellow foliage and weak growth produces similar\r\nsickly blooms, deficient in color, size, and fragrance. Also, observe\r\nthat taking off one half of the buds in May and June, is beneficial to\r\na continuance of bloom during the season; in dry weather they should be\r\nliberally supplied with rich water or soap suds, or if the ground has\r\nbeen abundantly manured, water of any description will suit; observing\r\nthat one copious supply once a week is better than a small portion every\r\nday.\r\n\r\nNOISETTE ROSES are those clustering sorts that bloom from early in the\r\nseason till destroyed by frost; their flowers are generally small, though\r\nthere are now some of them nearly as large as any others, but the size\r\ntakes from their profusion. The growth of the family is of all grades,\r\nfrom 1 foot to 20 feet in a season; unfortunately for us, however, the\r\nfiner kinds are rather tender, being nearly or entirely killed in our\r\nsevere winters. Those tender kinds of greatest splendor are Lamarque,\r\nCloth of Gold, Solfatare, La Victorieuse. These are hybridised with\r\nthe Tea Rose, making them more tender; but for milder climates than\r\nPhiladelphia the splendor of them equals any description. A friend writes\r\nme from Texas, that Cloth of Gold reaches the 3d story, and is in bloom\r\n9 months of the year, and its odor equal to the magnolia. In pruning\r\nNoisette Roses, thin out the old wood, and shorten the wood of the\r\nprevious season. The young wood should always be allowed to have its full\r\ngrowth, as it is most frequently terminated with a cluster of flowers;\r\nthe sorts without encroaching upon their beauties might be curtailed to\r\none full dozen, which would comprise as follows:\r\n\r\nAimie Vibert, pure white, very compact, a dwarf grower.\r\n\r\nCloth of Gold, a very luxuriant grower, requiring dry rich soil; flowers\r\nquite large, frequently 5 inches in diameter, opening a bright lemon\r\nyellow, and fading to a pale straw color; should be protected by covering\r\nin winter.\r\n\r\nDesprez or Jaune Desprez, flowers buff color shaded with pink, in profuse\r\nclusters, very fragrant, plant vigorous.\r\n\r\nFellenberg, color pink, red, or crimson as the season may be; a constant\r\nbloomer—does very well for a piazza or pillar, quite hardy.\r\n\r\nLafayette, this old fine pink rose must not be neglected; there are few\r\nor none to equal it in color and profusion; a moderate grower, flowers\r\nprettily cupped and quite profuse.\r\n\r\nOdorata, pure white, very sweet, an abundant bloomer and perfectly hardy;\r\nstood the winter of ’51, without any protection; of moderate growth.\r\n\r\nOphirie, color orange, orange and pink, pale yellow or bright yellow, all\r\naccording to the weather and season; blooms abundantly, especially in the\r\nautumnal months, flowers very double, plant hardy and growing freely;\r\nquite distinct, foliage of a pleasing lively green.\r\n\r\nPhilippart, dark pink, must be well established before its character is\r\nfully ascertained; blooms in large clusters; exceedingly hardy and of\r\nstrong growth.\r\n\r\nPourpre de Tyre, not easily to decide whether this variety is a Bourbon\r\nor Noisette; but florists place it where I now do. The flowers of medium\r\nsize, dark red or crimson color; plant of moderate growth.\r\n\r\nTriomphe de la Duchere, one of the very best Noisette roses, flowers\r\nabundant, large, full, of a rosy pink color and fragrant; plant strong,\r\nbut not rampant.\r\n\r\nVittelina, pure white, fine form, buds shaded with pink, very double,\r\nmedium size, growth moderate, very desirable.\r\n\r\nLamarque, flowers very large, white with a sulphur yellow centre, plant\r\nof strong growth, requires a dry sheltered situation with a rich soil,\r\nand to be protected during the severe weather about Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nI have omitted many others nearly equal to the above, such as Solfatare,\r\nDu Luxemberg, Phaloe, Boulogne, _Augusta_, &c. Of the latter I may say\r\nthat I have not yet conversed with a judge or no judge of roses, in\r\nthis vicinity, who pronounces it equal or nearly equal to the published\r\ndescription of it. I paid a V. for my plant, and consider it fully paid.\r\nIf I was now to make out a list to send to my Florist, I would say Cloth\r\nof Gold, Ophirie, Augusta, &c.\r\n\r\n[_To be continued._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STRAWBERRY CONTROVERSY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe communication of Mr. Meehan to the Pennsylvania Horticultural\r\nSociety, seems to have excited the opposition of all those persons, and\r\nwe believe they are the majority, who have settled the question to their\r\nown satisfaction, that the Strawberry is either pistillate or staminate,\r\nand unchangeably so. Mr. Meehan has produced his plants (of Hovey’s\r\nSeedling), with staminate flowers. The Strawberry cultivators pronounce\r\nthem (in the teeth of Mr. M’s assertion that they are runners from\r\npistillate plants,) to be not Hovey’s, but another variety. Some others\r\ntalk of the absurdity of plants being fruitful without fertilization,\r\nwhich, whether absurd or not, Mr. M. does not claim for his plants; we\r\nhave seen nothing yet on that side in the way of argument, it is all\r\nassertion;—The Cinn. Hort. Society, formally pronounced it impossible,\r\nand with them there is no appeal from their “ipse dixit.”\r\n\r\nIn the last number of the Farm. Journal, we have a letter, which we\r\nsuppose is from the eminent botanist of that region, which we copy, as\r\nsuggesting many reasons why Mr. Meehan may be right.\r\n\r\n    The statement of MR. MEEHAN, in the April number of the Farm\r\n    Journal, alleging that he has observed the sexual characters\r\n    of the Strawberry flowers to be variously modified by\r\n    culture, or different methods of treatment—has elicited some\r\n    strong asseverations of _opinion_, in contradiction to that\r\n    allegation of _fact_. One writer unhesitatingly declares the\r\n    alleged change to be “_utterly impossible_:” and I understand\r\n    that in the Queen City of the West, they have had a _public\r\n    gathering_, to deliberate on the subject, which resulted in a\r\n    _Pronunciamento_ adverse to MR. MEEHAN’S statement,—his facts\r\n    and observations being _rejected_ by a clear majority of the\r\n    voters present! The matter being thus _settled_, by preamble\r\n    and resolution after the manner of political difficulties at a\r\n    war-meeting, it may seem to be out of order, now, to offer any\r\n    remarks on the controverted topic. Nevertheless, as this is\r\n    reputed to be a Free Country, I should like to be indulged with\r\n    the privilege of submitting a few suggestions,—if not in arrest\r\n    of judgement, at least as a plea in mitigation of the sentence,\r\n    against my friend MEEHAN. It is the remark of a vigorous and\r\n    sagacious modern writer, that “no scientific question was ever\r\n    yet settled dogmatically, nor ever will;” and I think the same\r\n    may be especially predicated of questions of fact, in Natural\r\n    History. I may here observe, that I was favored with the\r\n    opportunity of examining one of MR. MEEHAN’S specimens,—in\r\n    which there were certainly two scapes from the same root—one\r\n    bearing a cyme of _pistillate_ flowers (with minute rudiments\r\n    of abortive stamens,) and the other a cyme of _perfect_, or\r\n    hermaphrodite flowers: and whether the specimen was the progeny\r\n    of a pistillate, a staminate, or a hermaphrodite plant, I\r\n    should think the inference plausible, that the flowers on at\r\n    least _one_ of these two cymes, must have been a modification,\r\n    or altered product, of the parent plant. It is this kind of\r\n    change, in the character of the flowers, which I understand\r\n    MR. MEEHAN to announce, as having occurred in plants under\r\n    his management. Now, in view of the countless modifications\r\n    daily observable in the organs of plants—and especially in\r\n    the _floral organs_—I can perceive no sufficient ground for\r\n    declaring the changes, reported by MR. MEEHAN, to be “_utterly\r\n    impossible_.” The modifications here referred to, are a very\r\n    different thing from the alleged _transmutation of one kind to\r\n    another_,—which is vulgarly supposed to take place in certain\r\n    plants, just as the Alchemists formerly pretended was affected\r\n    among the metals. They merely alter the texture, distort the\r\n    forms, or affect the developements of organs; but do neither\r\n    change nor annihilate those _essential characteristics_, by\r\n    which the plant is rendered permanently distinct from every\r\n    other genus and species. The floral organs of many plants are\r\n    remarkably subject to modification, under the long-continued\r\n    influences of soil, climate, and culture, or management.\r\n    Some flowers are rendered _double_, as it is termed, by the\r\n    expansion of stamens into petals; others become imperfect, and\r\n    even neutral, by the abortion or blighting of the stamens, or\r\n    pistils, or both. The _Strawberry_ appears to be very liable\r\n    to this kind of blight; and hence the much talked of sorts,\r\n    among cultivators, of _pistillates_, and _staminates_,—though\r\n    in all the pistillate flowers, which I have examined, there\r\n    were _vestiges_ more or less obvious, of abortive _stamens_,\r\n    on the rim of the calyx. It also varies much, under culture,\r\n    in some other features,—especially in the developement and\r\n    character or quality of the _receptacle_, or what is commonly\r\n    regarded as _fruit_: but no one, I believe, has yet seen a\r\n    Strawberry plant transmuted into a _Cinquefoil_, though so\r\n    nearly allied in habit. The organs of plants may be greatly\r\n    disguised by the influences above mentioned; but still the\r\n    essential distinguishing traits are preserved,—and there\r\n    seems to be no insuperable obstacle to prevent a plant, with\r\n    modified or abortive organs, from reverting, under a change\r\n    of circumstances, to its original condition, and resuming\r\n    its pristine form and character. The normal, or what may be\r\n    called the _constitutional_ character of the Strawberry-flower,\r\n    is to be _perfect_—_i. e._ furnished with both stamens and\r\n    pistils (possibly such may be the true normal structure\r\n    of _all_ flowers); and although many other plants, as the\r\n    Strawberry, are found with _imperfect_, and even _neutral_\r\n    flowers,—every Naturalist and careful observer knows, that\r\n    there is often an obvious effort and tendency, in such flowers,\r\n    to a more complete development: _i. e._ to become _perfect_\r\n    and _regular_. We occasionally see _diandrous_ flowers become\r\n    _didynamous_,—and _didynamous_ plants developing _regular\r\n    petandrous_ flowers; and it is not at all unusual to find the\r\n    _staminate tassel_ of the cultivated Maize (_Zea Mays, L._ a\r\n    _monoicous_ plant,) bearing _fertile flowers_, and exhibiting\r\n    a very successful attempt at the production of an _Ear_—or\r\n    _cluster of Ears_—of _Indian corn_. These instances, I trust\r\n    (for it is needless to multiply them,) may suffice to show that\r\n    there is nothing irrational, nor incredible, in MR. MEEHAN’S\r\n    observations; and that it is rather strong phraseology,\r\n    to declare such phenomena to be “_utterly impossible_.”\r\n    The polemic writers on this Strawberry question, speak of\r\n    the necessity of staminate plants among the pistillate, to\r\n    produce, or perfect the _fruit_. No doubt, the pistils must be\r\n    fertilized, in order to produce _seeds_ that will vegetate.\r\n    But what do those gentlemen understand, by the “_fruit_?” Do\r\n    they mean the little single-seeded _akenes_ or _nutlets_, which\r\n    are sprinkled over the enlarged pulpy receptacle,—or do they\r\n    refer to the _receptacle itself_, which in popular parlance\r\n    is intended by the term “_fruit_?” If they have reference to\r\n    the _real fruit_—the _nutlets_ which contain the seed,—there\r\n    is probably no question (as already intimated) about the\r\n    necessity of staminate influence to produce perfect fruit. But\r\n    I have a suspicion, that by the term “_fruit_,” they mean the\r\n    delicious _receptacle_ which bears the fruit, and if they mean\r\n    to allege that the pistils must be fertilized by the stamens,\r\n    _in order to produce that enlargement of the receptacle_\r\n    which affords an _esculent substitute_ for fruit,—then I have\r\n    only to say, it is a _question of fact_ which I have had no\r\n    adequate opportunity to determine; and concerning which I,\r\n    for one, should be happy to receive reliable information. To\r\n    ascertain the point satisfactorily, would require very careful\r\n    experiments and observations. Whether such have been made, I am\r\n    not informed. I may remark, however, by way of _analogy_, that\r\n    there are instances in which _pistils_, and even _receptacles_,\r\n    are enlarged, where no staminate influence has been exerted.\r\n    The conglomorate coalescent _pistils_ of the Osage Orange\r\n    (_Maclura_,) for example, attain to their full natural size\r\n    (although the _seeds_ are necessarily imperfect,) where no\r\n    staminate plant is in the neighborhood; and, what affords a\r\n    closer analogy, the including _receptacle_ of the _pistillate\r\n    Fig_ is fully developed; when entirely free from any staminate\r\n    influence. Whether the _receptacle_ of the _Strawberry_ ever\r\n    enlarges, without the pistils being fertilized, (as already\r\n    stated,) is more than I can tell; but I feel well assured, that\r\n    any competent authority, who may furnish the information, will\r\n    make an acceptable contribution to physiological Botany.\r\n\r\n                                                               W. D.\r\n\r\n    _West Chester, June 6, 1853._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STRAWBERRY QUESTION.\r\n\r\n\r\n    MR. EDITOR:—Who among horticulturists has not heard of the\r\n    “Strawberry Question”—has not wondered at the opposite opinions\r\n    held by eminent cultivators, and perhaps like myself has\r\n    been surprised that the spirit of inquiry has not been more\r\n    generally diffused concerning a subject of so much importance.\r\n    Is it because our instructors cannot come to a unanimous\r\n    conclusion upon it, that we pupils in horticulture have been\r\n    doubtful about expressing our opinions upon it, or have we\r\n    never studied the subject for ourselves but left them in their\r\n    wisdom to decide it for us? I was in this position waiting for\r\n    their decision, but as it was not likely to be forthcoming, I\r\n    resolved to study the subject for myself, have done so this\r\n    season, and will give you my experience in connection with the\r\n    “Strawberry Question.”\r\n\r\n    The points of difference between a staminate and pistillate\r\n    strawberry flower are so marked that a very casual observer\r\n    cannot fail to notice them at once, for in staminate varieties\r\n    the flowers are lax, the sepals of the calyx appear alternately\r\n    with the petals of the corolla, the stamens occupy the most\r\n    prominent place in the flower, rising half their length above\r\n    the central pistils, are very much swelled at the base, and\r\n    very large compared with the other parts of the flower, anthers\r\n    broadly heart shaped, large, and producing abundance of pollen.\r\n    Pistils, loose, long, and having a barren appearance, which is\r\n    soon proved by their withering away, and leaving the stamens\r\n    masters of the field. The embryo receptacle when it does\r\n    exist at all is very much flattened, and in the most of cases\r\n    cannot be said to exist at all, the pistils being inserted in\r\n    the thickened cup of the calyx. All flowers that have this\r\n    appearance in these varieties, very soon wither away and leave\r\n    this impression on the mind of the observer, that they were\r\n    surely staminate varieties. But as all staminate varieties do\r\n    not thus wither away, but many of them produce fruit, it may be\r\n    asked are the flowers all the same in appearance. It is here\r\n    where the peculiarities in this class are met with, for there\r\n    are few but what produce some fruit, and as real staminate\r\n    flowers could not produce this fruit, it would readily be seen\r\n    that staminate varieties produce two sorts of flowers; the\r\n    one where the organs are unequally balanced which produce no\r\n    fruit, the other where the flowers are perfect and are fruit\r\n    bearing. The appearance of the flower that will produce fruit\r\n    is markedly different from the other—by the shortness of the\r\n    stamens, the conical shaped receptacle, the pistils stiff and\r\n    thickly set thereon. The flower is altogether more compact, and\r\n    is as perfect in its organs as any of the Alpine varieties. The\r\n    following sorts have proved staminate with me.\r\n\r\n    Cuthill’s Black Prince, Boston Pine, Kittley’s Goliath, Alice\r\n    Maud, British Queen, Ross’s Phœnix, and Victoria.\r\n\r\n    Among pistillate varieties, the flowers are cup shaped,\r\n    compact, with the sepals of the calyx scarcely perceptible\r\n    between the petals of the corolla. Stamens seldom visible,\r\n    and when seen at all they are very minute, not longer than\r\n    the pistils at the base of receptacle, never showing signs\r\n    of having fertilizing powers, as the anthers never expand;\r\n    the whole remains perfectly abortive. Pistils very numerous,\r\n    uniform, stout, longer than in perfect flowers, and have not\r\n    such a feathery appearance as in staminate sorts. Receptacle\r\n    large, conical, always coming to perfection, and the instances\r\n    where pistillate flowers do not produce berries are very rare,\r\n    in fact scarcely ever to be met with; at least my sorts have\r\n    proved so; and it is reasonable to conclude that this has been\r\n    occasioned by the sorts growing together. The following sorts\r\n    have proved pistillate with me.\r\n\r\n    Bourbon Pine, Hudson, Swanson, Burr’s Pine, Hovey’s Seedling,\r\n    Iowa, and Moyamensing.\r\n\r\n    The varieties enumerated, I have growing together (both\r\n    pistillate and staminate) under what might be called the\r\n    ordinary mode of cultivation in one place; and in another\r\n    completely isolated from them, I have a collection of the same\r\n    sorts which have stood some years longer, and are almost worn\r\n    out. But this difference of situation, culture, &c. don’t at\r\n    all seem to have affected or in the least degree altered the\r\n    organs of re-production in any variety; for to me it seems that\r\n    the character of pistillate or staminate is as permanent and\r\n    unchangeable as in any other deciduous plant.\r\n\r\n    A writer in one of the periodicals of the day, supposes it\r\n    possible that the receptacle of the strawberry might enlarge,\r\n    or even come to perfection without staminate influence having\r\n    at all been required. That the experiment of planting a\r\n    pistillate strawberry in a situation where staminate influence\r\n    could not reach it and that plant produce no berry, is the\r\n    fact; as was proved by a cultivator in this neighborhood:\r\n    but it is to be hoped that the coming season will be taken\r\n    advantage of by many of your correspondents, for making\r\n    experiments that will place this question in such a clear\r\n    and forcible manner before the public, so that all may be\r\n    convinced, and those interested in the culture of this fruit\r\n    may take advantage of, and turn to good account the information\r\n    received.\r\n\r\n                                                                  F.\r\n\r\nWe hope that those of our friends who have made any observations, or\r\nhave anything to say on this interesting subject will be kind enough to\r\ncommunicate them to us.—ED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAMMONIA ON PLANTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe subject of the action of Ammonia on plants is exciting considerable\r\nattention in England. We copy below from the Gardener’s Chronicle\r\naccounts of experiments, the first of which is being tried at the\r\nHorticultural Society’s Garden.\r\n\r\n    M. Ville’s mode of giving Ammonia to plants, with a view to\r\n    increase their bulk and vigour, is being tried in the large\r\n    stove in which one of his apparatuses has been placed. It\r\n    consists of two clear glass bottles with long necks, furnished\r\n    with tight-fitting corks, in each of which is inserted a small\r\n    bent glass tube. These two tubes are joined together by means\r\n    of an India-rubber connection, or small hose, thus forming\r\n    a communication between the two bottles. In the cork of one\r\n    of the bottles is an escape tube (also of glass), which is\r\n    connected (by means of a small India-rubber hose), with other\r\n    small glass pipes that are laid all along and across the bed,\r\n    and through which the ammonia is intended to pass, in order\r\n    that it may be the better diffused among the plants. When the\r\n    bottles are put to work, one is charged with chalk, on which\r\n    is poured sulphuric acid, and the other with unslacked lime,\r\n    over which is poured a solution of ammonia. The result of this\r\n    experiment will, of course, be published in due time. Its\r\n    conduct has been entrusted to Mr. Spriggs, the young man in\r\n    charge of the house, who is to note down its effects daily, and\r\n    report the same to the Vice-Secretary. In another column will\r\n    be found some further account of furnishing plants with more\r\n    ammonia than they can get under ordinary circumstances.\r\n\r\n    By Mr. Deane, Vice President of the Pharmaceutical Society.\r\n    Effects analogous to those produced by M. Ville (see last\r\n    year’s volume, p. 755), with ammoniated air on the leaves\r\n    of growing plants, have been observed by me, as the results\r\n    of applying solutions of ammoniacal salts to the roots.\r\n    My attention was first effectively turned to the subject\r\n    about eight or ten years since, when an extensive grower of\r\n    Pelargoniums, Fuchsias, and Roses, applied to me for some\r\n    remedy for the sickly condition of his stock; which, if left\r\n    unchecked, would insure a very severe loss to him. On examining\r\n    the plants they were found to be in a starving condition,\r\n    the roots having filled the pots and exhausted the soil;\r\n    consequently, the leaves had lost their healthy green colour,\r\n    and become very pale, with a strong tinge of yellow; the lower\r\n    leaves were quite yellow, spotted, and falling off. The natural\r\n    remedy was obviously fresh potting, but as the plants were\r\n    already in pots best adapted to answer the purposes of the\r\n    grower, some other remedy had to be devised. I therefore made\r\n    a very weak solution of sulphate and carbonate of ammonia, and\r\n    therewith watered the roots of the plants once a day, in the\r\n    evening; and to insure any observed results as to the effect\r\n    of the ammonia, certain rows of the plants on the stage of the\r\n    greenhouse were selected for the experiment. In a few days the\r\n    effects of the ammonia were most marked and satisfactory. The\r\n    leaves began to put on a very remarkable appearance, the course\r\n    of the veins, or spiral vessels, becoming perfectly green,\r\n    the colour commencing at the basal portion of the midrib, and\r\n    thence spreading through all the reticulations, until the\r\n    tissues were perfectly restored to their normal and healthy\r\n    condition; and, in fact, the plants thus treated looked more\r\n    vigorous than they had ever done before, being much darker\r\n    colour and firmer in texture. The contrast between these plants\r\n    and those which had received no ammonia left no doubt about\r\n    the efficiency of the application. I forget the effects upon\r\n    the flowering of the Pelargoniums, but there was certainly no\r\n    deficiency of flowers on the Fuchsias and Roses; they were,\r\n    moreover, finer and better coloured than usual. On a subsequent\r\n    occasion a gentleman’s gardener applied to me in a similar\r\n    dilemma; he had a house full of fancy Pelargoniums preparing\r\n    for a flower-show, at which he expected to take the first\r\n    prize. Just as the trusses of flower buds were emerging, and\r\n    there was every prospect of a good bloom, the lower leaves of\r\n    the plants began to turn yellow and spotted, and then to fall\r\n    off, leaving the plants bare, where the foliage was considered\r\n    an essential point of beauty. I examined the roots and found\r\n    them nearly filling the pots, it was therefore evident there\r\n    was not sufficient nutriment left in the pots to meet the\r\n    extra demand made by the large number of flower-buds; the\r\n    latter were, consequently, deriving their nourishment from the\r\n    leaves—the natural storehouse of the food of plants during\r\n    the growing season—and of course exhausted the lower leaves\r\n    first. They were treated precisely as in the former instance,\r\n    and with the same results; the lower leaves became healthy,\r\n    and the flower-buds progressed favourably to maturity, being\r\n    of good form and colour. The success of these experiments\r\n    became known to other gardeners in the neighbourhood, some of\r\n    whom were equally successful, while others did not derive that\r\n    satisfaction from the use of the ammoniacal solution, either\r\n    from not understanding the principle of its application, or\r\n    from a desire to accomplish more than they were capable of,\r\n    when it frequently happened the plants became too vigorous to\r\n    flower well. There is no doubt but that M. Ville is correct\r\n    in stating that the flowering is arrested if the application\r\n    of ammonia is made at a certain period of the development\r\n    of the flower-buds. Few plants if grown too vigorously will\r\n    flower well, if at all. A certain check in their growth is\r\n    absolutely necessary, and the summer’s sun or winter’s cold,\r\n    under ordinary circumstances, effects this perfectly in this\r\n    climate—the former by perfecting and condensing the elaborated\r\n    sap, and the latter by arresting vegetation altogether.\r\n    Too much moisture and shade cause those parts intended for\r\n    flower-buds to be developed as leaves. In the Aloe tribe when\r\n    the flower stem is thrown up, it is at the expense of the\r\n    outer leaves, the elaborated juices of which it appropriates,\r\n    the roots at this time not being in action, because it is\r\n    towards the close of a long period of dryness. If when the\r\n    flower-stem is beginning to rise, the roots are watered, all\r\n    further development of the stem is arrested, the leaves only\r\n    being developed. The same thing takes place with many bulbs\r\n    whose period of flowering is not the same as that for leafing.\r\n    Many Cape bulbs follow this law; for example, the Hæmanthus,\r\n    the flowering of which is at the expense of some one or more\r\n    of the outer coats. If these plants are watered at the wrong\r\n    period, or if they have had not that proper rest which Nature\r\n    designed they should have under the influence of a roasting\r\n    sun, such as their native country affords, no flowers will be\r\n    produced, but in their stead a vigorous development of leaves.\r\n    It would appear, therefore, that the arrest of development of\r\n    the flowers and fruits of the plants treated with ammonia, is\r\n    not so much the result of any specific property possessed by\r\n    this substance, as by its bringing about artificially those\r\n    conditions which may occur naturally, or be produced by other\r\n    means. Also, that the application of ammonia to plants may be\r\n    attended by results varying according to the conditions under\r\n    which it is applied, and the object it is desired to obtain.\r\n    The following is the formula for the solution alluded to in\r\n    the previous note by Mr. Deane:—Sulphate of ammonia, 7000\r\n    grains; sesquicarbonate ditto, 1000 grains; water, 80 fl. oz.\r\n    Dissolve. Of this solution one fluid once to a gallon of water\r\n    will make a solution, sufficiently strong for all ordinary\r\n    purposes.—_Pharmaceutical Journal._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCALENDAR OF OPERATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISBUDDING.—This operation does not appear to be sufficiently recognised\r\nin its proper sense as distinguished from pruning and pinching. In\r\nperforming these latter operations we remove a portion of the growing\r\nshoot, in the former case the young bud is removed as soon as it can be\r\nrubbed off. These operations are therefore quite distinct, and their\r\ndistinction is of much importance. Most fruit cultivators are aware that\r\ntrees suffer materially by suddenly depriving them of a large portion of\r\nfoliage while in active growth, and expedients are resorted to in order\r\nto render the operation less injurious. In spring when the buds burst,\r\nattention should be directed to the quantity of young shoots desirable\r\neither for fruit or uniformity of growth; these being secured all others\r\nshould immediately be _rubbed_ off. As growth proceeds luxuriant shoots\r\nare _stopped_ or their points pinched off, removing more or less of the\r\nshoot, according to the object to be attained. If the plant is very\r\nluxuriant, more leaves may be removed and if _every_ shoot upon a tree is\r\noperated on in this manner it amounts to a severe check on its growth. In\r\nthe case of young trees, or weakly ones, where a certain form is desired,\r\nthe young growing point should be bruised without removing any of the\r\nelaborating foliage, securing density of habit without any perceptible\r\ncheck of growth. Suppose a shoot that has grown 12 or 14 inches to be\r\npinched back one half of its length, the uppermost bud will burst again\r\nand the others remain comparatively dormant; but allowing the same shoot\r\nto have been checked in its longitudinal growth, by pinching or bruising\r\nits extreme point, it will be found that all the lower buds will be\r\nbenefitted and several additional shoots produced. We have alluded to\r\nthis subject more particularly at present as we are aware of having\r\noccasionally made use of the term _pinching_ when _disbudding_ would have\r\nbeen the more appropriate expression.\r\n\r\nSTRAWBERRIES.—Preparations should now be in progress for securing plants\r\nfor early forcing next spring. Various methods are adopted to get strong\r\nplants, such as filling small pots with rich soil and plunging them in\r\nthe strawberry patch, introducing a young plant on the pot, and removing\r\ninto larger ones when rooted. Others again prepare full sized pots at\r\nonce and place them in this manner, securing the young plant in both\r\ncases with a small stone laid on the surface. When close attention is\r\npaid in watering, these plans are good. An equally successful and less\r\ntroublesome method is to prepare a few square yards of ground in a\r\nsomewhat sheltered situation, manuring it well and digging deeply, and\r\nfilling it thickly with young plants. They should be partially shaded for\r\na few days, and duly watered. In the course of three or four weeks they\r\nwill lift with good balls of earth and are potted at once in fruiting\r\npots. Pistilo-staminate or hermaphrodite varieties are found to produce\r\nbetter when forced early than pistillate sorts.\r\n\r\nRoot pruning of fruit trees is sometimes commendable, and the present is\r\nthe proper season for its more immediate beneficial effects. It is mostly\r\nperformed on young vigorous trees that show no disposition to fruit. By\r\ncutting away some of the strongest roots at this time the supply of sap\r\nwill be lessened and the wood ripening process accelerated. No fruit\r\nneed be expected from badly ripened wood. In nine cases out of ten the\r\nnon-appearance of fruit on healthy trees arises from this cause. Mild\r\nautumn weather induces growth to a late period and sudden frosts arrive\r\nbefore the wood is sufficiently matured. This is more particularly\r\nnoticeable on soils inclined to be wet, and here again we perceive the\r\nnecessity of underground drains, in order to remove surplus water. It\r\nis an exceedingly erroneous idea that drains are worse than useless in\r\nlocalities where long droughts are of frequent occurrence. The truth is\r\nthat draining enhances humidity during hot weather, since it enables the\r\nsoil to exercise its absorbing properties to the fullest extent, there\r\nbeing more air in the soil water is retained in its pores, constituting a\r\nreservoir holding a lasting supply when other sources fail.\r\n\r\nRENOVATING OLD TREES.—Most satisfactory results have been obtained from\r\nold and apparently worn out trees by changing the soil about their\r\nroots, or applying a top dressing of wood ashes, guano, salt and plaster\r\nin equal quantities, allowing about one bushel of the mixture to each\r\ntree. If nothing better is convenient, a heavy dressing of well made\r\nbarn manure forked in about the roots will have a decided effect. The\r\nabsorbing points of the roots extend a considerable distance from the\r\ntrunk, therefore, the principal part of the top dressing should embrace\r\na circumference at least equal to that of the branches. It might be\r\nconsidered unnecessary to mention this _very_ apparent fact, were it not\r\nusual to observe manure applied to the stem instead of the roots.\r\n\r\nGRAPES UNDER GLASS will now be approaching maturity. Dryness both in\r\nsoil and atmosphere favors this process, still they must not be allowed\r\nto suffer for want of moisture should the weather prove dry. The young\r\ngrowth may be stopped more rigidly as the ripening process proceeds. This\r\nwill concentrate the sap and strengthen the buds for a future crop, if\r\npinched back too severely these buds may start into growth, which must be\r\nguarded against.\r\n\r\nOUT-DOOR GRAPES will require attention in thinning out lateral shoots\r\nand stopping others especially those on bearing shoots. Thinning out the\r\nberries is seldom practised on these, nor, indeed is it always necessary.\r\nOccasionally, however, the berries are so thickly placed that room is not\r\nafforded them to swell out and ripen properly. By thinning out a few of\r\nthe most central and smallest berries, the fruit will ripen earlier and\r\nbe much improved both in size and flavor.\r\n\r\n                                                                    S. B.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAUGUST.\r\n\r\nFLOWER GARDEN AND PLEASURE GROUND.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the month many prefer to plant their evergreens, and it is\r\nperhaps as good a time as any. Take advantage of a “wet spell” for the\r\noperation. Be particularly careful that as many roots as possible are\r\npreserved. If this can be well attended to, _trees of any size_ can be\r\nmoved successfully. It becomes a question of power—of profit and loss.\r\nIf any amount of power can be applied, and expense is no object, the\r\nlargest trees will move as easily as small ones. In moving an evergreen\r\n20 feet high, I commence to open my “trench” 10 feet from the base of\r\nthe trunk, go down about two feet, and continue to undermine and lay\r\nbare the roots their full length, right up to the collar of the tree. I\r\ncare nothing for “ball of earth.” If I have a good supply of hands at\r\nthe job, I only care to keep them aside a little to prevent injury by\r\nthe operations of the workmen. If I have but few men, I roll the long\r\nroots, as fast as they are exposed, in mats to keep them moist. For\r\nmechanical means and adaptations to take out the tree and convey it to\r\nits destination, an intelligent workman is never at a loss. Trees taken\r\nup in this manner scarcely miss the change; and besides after they are\r\ntransplanted they require no staking, as they are capable of withstanding\r\nthe strongest wind through their long roots.\r\n\r\nThe broom should be well applied to lawns at this season of the year,\r\neven more sedulously than in spring. Many species of weed become so\r\ndwarfed by the summer’s drought, that they flower and fruit below the\r\nreach of the scythe, and can only be kept down by the hard sweeping. I\r\nhave seen some lawns almost ruined by these weeds, especially by one of\r\nthe nettle tribe.
