There are tractors with one driving wheel, with two\r\ndriving wheels, with three and with four, as well as three arrangements\r\nof the crawler principle; there are two-wheelers, three-wheelers and\r\nfour-wheelers; tractors that are controlled by pedals and levers and\r\ntractors that are driven by reins.\r\n\r\nThus if a man who is competent to handle and care for one make is given\r\nanother make to run, he may be entirely at a loss as to how it works\r\nand how it should be handled.\r\n\r\nIt is the purpose of this book to explain and describe all of the\r\nmechanisms that are in common use in tractor construction, to the end\r\nthat the reader may be able to identify and understand the parts of\r\nwhatever make he may see or handle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                PAGE\r\n                         CHAPTER I\r\n                    TRACTOR PRINCIPLES\r\n

While it can run over rough roads, these must be hard enough\r\nto support it; on soft ground it will sink in and be unable to get\r\nitself out. It can make great speed over smooth, level roads; but only\r\nrarely do road and police conditions permit it to run its fastest for\r\nmore than a few minutes at a time. For the greater part of its life it\r\ndevelops only a portion of the power of which it is capable.\r\n\r\nA tractor, on the other hand, is intended not to carry, but to haul.\r\nIt must run and do its work on rough hillsides, soft bottoms, or any\r\nother land where it is required to go. Instead of developing speed it\r\ndevelops pulling power, and must be able to develop its full power\r\ncontinuously.\r\n\r\nAppearance and comfort count for a great deal in an automobile, and\r\nmuch attention is devoted to making it noiseless and simple to manage.\r\nThese things do not apply in a tractor, which is a labor-saving and\r\nmoney-making machine, valuable only for the work that it can do. There\r\nis no question of upholstery or nickel-plating; all that is wanted is a\r\nmachine that will do the required work with the least possible cost of\r\noperation.\r\n\r\nAs is the case with any kind of machine that is purchased as a\r\nmoney-maker, its cost should be as low as is consistent with its\r\nability to do its work. Any extra cost for accessories, or finish, or\r\nother detail, is wasted unless it permits the machine to do more work,\r\nor, by making the operator more comfortable, allows him to run the\r\nmachine for a longer stretch of time or with greater efficiency.\r\n\r\nIt may be taken for granted that any tractor will run and will do its\r\nwork with satisfaction, provided it is sensibly handled and cared for.\r\nFar more troubles and breakdowns come from careless handling and from\r\nneglect than from faulty design and material. A tractor that is running\r\nand doing its work is earning a return on the money invested in it;\r\nwhen it is laid up for repairs there is not only a loss of interest on\r\nthe investment, but a loss of the value of the work that it might be\r\ndoing.\r\n\r\nTo keep a tractor running is a matter only of understanding and of\r\ncommon sense; common sense to realize that any piece of machinery needs\r\nsome degree of care and attention, and understanding of where the care\r\nand attention should be applied. The more thoroughly a tractor operator\r\nunderstands his machine, the more work he will be able to get out of\r\nit, and the more continuously it will run. This is only another way of\r\nsaying that understanding and knowledge pay a direct return in work\r\ndone and money earned.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of the automobile there were as many types of cars\r\nas there were manufacturers. As time has gone on, the unsatisfactory\r\nideas have been weeded out, and automobiles have approached what may be\r\ncalled a standard design.\r\n\r\nAt the present time, tractor designs are varied, and it is hardly\r\npossible to speak of any type as standard. The reason for this lies in\r\nthe fact that many manufacturers start with a design for one special\r\npart, and build the tractor around it.\r\n\r\nFor example, a manufacturer may develop a method of driving the wheels\r\nthat he feels is especially good for tractor work. In applying it he\r\nmay find that the engine must be so placed on the frame that when the\r\npower pulley is in position the belt will interfere with the front\r\nwheels unless they are small; he therefore uses small front wheels, and\r\nadvocates them for tractors.\r\n\r\nAnother manufacturer with a patent steering gear may be able to place\r\nthe power pulley so that there is ample clearance for the belt; he\r\nfinds that by using high front wheels he can get a better support for\r\nthe frame, and therefore claims that high front wheels are an advantage.\r\n\r\nOther designs may be based on having three wheels, or two; advantages\r\nare claimed for each type, and each type undoubtedly has them.\r\n\r\nThe selection of a tractor is based on one’s own experience or on\r\nthat of neighbors, or on the ability of the salesman to bring out the\r\nadvantages of the make that he sells; but when the tractor is bought\r\nand delivered, its ability to do the work promised for it depends\r\nsolely on the care with which it is handled and looked after.\r\n\r\nWhatever the design of a tractor may be, there are certain parts that\r\nit must have in order to do the work required of it. These parts, or\r\ngroups of parts, are as follows:\r\n\r\n=Engine.=—This furnishes the power by which the tractor operates.\r\n\r\n=Clutch.=—By means of a clutch the engine may be connected with the\r\nmechanism, so that the tractor moves, or it may be disconnected, so\r\nthat it may run without moving the tractor.\r\n\r\n=Change Speed Gear.=—As will be explained in later chapters, an engine,\r\nin order to work most efficiently, should run at a fixed speed; the\r\ntractor should be able to run fast or slow, according to conditions.\r\nA change speed gear is therefore provided, by which the speed of the\r\ntractor may be changed, although there is no change in the speed of the\r\nengine.\r\n\r\n=Drive.=—The drive is the mechanism that applies the power of the\r\nengine to the wheels, and makes them turn.\r\n\r\n=Differential.=—When a tractor makes a turn, the outside wheels cover\r\na larger circle than the inside wheels, and therefore must run faster\r\nin order to get around in the same time. It is usually the case that\r\nthe power of the engine is applied to both driving wheels; if both were\r\nsolid on the axle, like the wheels of a railroad car, one would be\r\nforced to slip when making a turn, which would waste power. By applying\r\na differential, the engine can drive both wheels, but the wheels may\r\nrun at different speeds when conditions require it.\r\n\r\nThe clutch, change speed gear, drive and differential form the\r\n_transmission_.\r\n\r\n=Steering gear.=—By means of the steering gear the direction in which\r\nthe tractor moves may be changed.\r\n\r\n=Supports.=—A tractor moves on broad-tired wheels, or on crawlers,\r\nwhich are so formed that they grip the ground and do not slip. They\r\ngive so broad a support that even on soft ground the weight of the\r\ntractor will not pack the soil sufficiently to injure it as a seed bed.\r\n\r\n=Frame.=—The frame is the foundation of the tractor, and holds the\r\nparts in the proper relation to each other. It is usually made of\r\nchannel steel, the parts being bolted to it; in some tractors, however,\r\nthe parts are so attached to each other that they form their own\r\nsupport, and no other frame is needed.\r\n\r\nTractor manufacturers make these parts in different ways; all\r\naccomplish the same result, but do it by different methods. The main\r\nprinciples are much the same, and should be known and understood. They\r\nare described and explained in the succeeding chapters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nENGINE PRINCIPLES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe working part of a tractor is the engine; it is this that furnishes\r\nthe power that makes the machine go.\r\n\r\nThe engine gets its power from the burning of a mixture of fuel vapor\r\nand air. When this mixture burns, it becomes heated, and, as is usual\r\nwith hot things, it tries to expand, or to occupy more room.\r\n\r\nThe mixture is placed in a cylinder, between the closed end and the\r\npiston; it is then heated by being burned, and, in struggling to\r\nexpand, it forces the piston to slide down the cylinder. This movement\r\nof the piston makes the crank shaft revolve, which in turn drives the\r\ntractor.\r\n\r\nThe first step in making the engine run is to put a charge of mixture\r\ninto the cylinder, and it is clear that if the burning of the charge is\r\nto move the piston, the piston must be in such a position that it is\r\nable to move. When the mixture is burned, the piston must therefore be\r\nat the closed end of the cylinder.\r\n\r\nAfter the charge of mixture has been burned, the cylinder must be\r\ncleared of the dead and useless gases that remain, in order to make\r\nroom for a fresh charge.\r\n\r\nThe charge of mixture is drawn into the cylinder just as a pump sucks\r\nin water. At a time when the piston is at the closed end of the\r\ncylinder, a valve is opened connecting the space above the piston with\r\nthe device that forms the mixture; then by moving the piston outward,\r\nmixture is sucked into the space above it. When the piston reaches the\r\nend of its stroke the cylinder has been filled with mixture, and the\r\nvalve then closes.\r\n\r\nIt would be useless to set fire to the mixture at that time, for the\r\npiston is as far down the cylinder as it can be, and pressure could\r\nnot move it any farther. To get the piston into such a position that\r\nthe expanding mixture can move it, it is forced back to the closed end\r\nof the cylinder. This squeezes or _compresses_, the cylinderful of\r\nmixture into the small space, called the _combustion chamber_, between\r\nthe piston and the cylinder head.\r\n\r\nIf the mixture is now burned, the piston can move the length of the\r\ncylinder, and in so doing it develops power.\r\n\r\nThe cylinder is cleared of the burned and useless gases by opening a\r\nvalve and pushing them out by moving the piston back to the inner end\r\nof the cylinder. When this has been done, the valve is closed, and, by\r\nopening the inlet valve and moving the piston outward, a fresh charge\r\nis sucked in, and the several steps of the _gas engine cycle_ are\r\nrepeated.\r\n\r\nThe name _cycle_ is given to any series of steps or events that must be\r\ngone through in order that a thing may happen. Thus the empty shell\r\nmust be taken out of a gun and a fresh cartridge put in before the gun\r\ncan be fired again, and that series of steps might be called the gun\r\ncycle.\r\n\r\nThe gas engine cycle requires the piston to make four strokes. An\r\noutward stroke sucks in a charge of mixture, and an inward stroke\r\nreturns the piston to the firing position and compresses the charge.\r\nThen comes the outward stroke when the piston moves under power,\r\nfollowed by the inward stroke that clears the cylinder of the burned\r\ngases.\r\n\r\nFor every stroke of the piston the crank shaft makes a half-revolution;\r\nthe crank shaft therefore makes two revolutions to four strokes of the\r\npiston and to each repetition of the gas engine cycle.\r\n\r\nOf these four strokes of the piston only one produces power. The other\r\nthree strokes, called the _dead strokes_, are required to prepare for\r\nanother power stroke.\r\n\r\nA gas engine cylinder thus produces power for only one quarter of the\r\ntime that it runs. This is one of the striking differences between the\r\ngas engine and the steam engine, for the piston of a steam engine moves\r\nunder power all of the time that the engine runs.\r\n\r\nA one-cylinder gas engine must have something to make the piston go\r\nthrough the dead strokes, for otherwise the piston would stop at\r\nthe end of the power stroke; the piston is kept in motion by heavy\r\nflywheels attached to the crank shaft. These, like any object, try to\r\ncontinue in motion when once they are started; a power stroke starts\r\nthe crank shaft revolving and its flywheels keep it going.\r\n\r\nThus, the piston drives the crank shaft during the power stroke, and\r\nthe crank shaft drives the piston during the dead strokes.\r\n\r\nTo start an engine, the crank shaft is revolved to make the piston suck\r\nin a charge of mixture and compress it; then the charge is burned, the\r\npower stroke takes place, and the engine runs.\r\n\r\nA clear idea of what goes on inside of the cylinder is quite necessary\r\nin order to take proper care of an engine and to get the best work\r\nout of it. The following description applies to any cylinder, for the\r\naction in all cylinders of an engine is the same.\r\n\r\n=Inlet Stroke.=—During the inlet stroke (No. 1, Fig. 1), the piston\r\nmoves outward; the inlet valve is open, and the exhaust valve is\r\nclosed. This movement of the piston creates suction, and if there\r\nare leaks in the cylinder, air will be sucked in and will spoil the\r\nproportions of the charge. This will prevent the proper burning of the\r\nmixture, and the engine will lose power.\r\n\r\nThe piston moves at such high speed that the mixture cannot enter fast\r\nenough to keep up with it; mixture is still flowing in when the piston\r\nreaches the end of its stroke, and even when it begins to move inward\r\non the next stroke. The more mixture there is in the cylinder, the more\r\npowerfully the engine will run; the inlet valve is therefore held open\r\nfor as long a time as the mixture continues to enter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.—THE GAS ENGINE CYCLE]\r\n\r\nIn slow-speed 1-cylinder and 2-cylinder engines the valve closes when\r\nthe piston reaches the end of its stroke; on high-speed engines the\r\nvalve does not close until the piston has moved ¼ inch or ½ inch on the\r\ncompression stroke.\r\n\r\n=Compression Stroke.=—During the compression stroke (No. 2, Fig. 1)\r\nthe piston moves inward, and both valves are closed. This movement\r\nplaces the piston in position to move outward on the power stroke.\r\nAs the outlets to the cylinder are closed, the charge of mixture\r\ncannot escape, and is therefore compressed into the space between the\r\npiston and the cylinder head when the piston is at the inner end of\r\nits stroke. This space is usually about one quarter the volume of the\r\ncylinder; the charge is therefore compressed to about one quarter of\r\nits original volume.\r\n\r\nThis compression of the charge is very important in the operation of\r\nthe gas engine, and any interference with it will make the engine run\r\npoorly.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it improves the quality of the charge, and makes it\r\nburn very much better. When the charge enters the cylinder, the fuel\r\nvapor and air are not thoroughly mixed; much of the fuel is not turned\r\ninto vapor. By compressing the charge it becomes heated; this vaporizes\r\nthe fuel, and vapor and air become thoroughly mixed.\r\n\r\nCompression also increases the power. Suppose that the cylinder\r\ncontains a quart of mixture which, when heated, will expand to a\r\ngallon. If this quart of mixture is compressed to a half pint, it\r\nwill not lose its ability to expand to a gallon, and will exert more\r\npressure in expanding from a half pint to a gallon than from a quart to\r\na gallon.\r\n\r\nA leaky cylinder will cause a further loss of power because some of the\r\ncharge will escape during the compression stroke, which will leave less\r\nto be burned and to develop power.\r\n\r\n=Ignition.=—Setting fire to the charge of mixture is called the\r\n_ignition_ of the charge, and it takes place close to the end of the\r\ncompression stroke. To get the greatest power, all of the mixture\r\nshould be on fire and heated most intensely as the piston begins the\r\npower stroke.\r\n\r\nWhen the mixture is set on fire, it does not explode like gunpowder,\r\nbut burns comparatively slowly; the charge is ignited by an electric\r\nspark, and the flame spreads from that point until it is all on\r\nfire. In order to give the flame time to spread, the spark passes\r\nsufficiently before the end of the compression stroke to have the\r\nentire charge on fire as the power stroke begins. This is called the\r\n_advance_ of the ignition.\r\n\r\nThe flame takes the same time to spread through the charge when the\r\nengine is running fast as when it is running slow. Therefore if the\r\nengine is speeded up, the spark must be advanced, for otherwise the\r\npiston would be on the power stroke before the flame would have time to\r\nspread all through the mixture.\r\n\r\nWhen the engine is slowed down, the spark must have less advance, or\r\nmust be _retarded_, for, if it were not, the charge would all be in\r\nflame, and exerting its full pressure, before the piston reached the\r\nend of its compression stroke.\r\n\r\nThe subject of ignition, which is of great importance, is covered more\r\nfully in Chapter VI.\r\n\r\n=Power Stroke.=—During the power stroke (No. 3, Fig. 1) the piston\r\nmoves outward, and both valves are closed. As it begins, the mixture is\r\nall on fire, and great pressure is exerted against the piston.\r\n\r\nAs the piston moves outward the combustion space becomes larger, and\r\nthe gases obtain the room for expansion that they seek. As they expand,\r\nthe pressure that they exert becomes less. By the time the piston\r\nis three quarters the way down the power stroke, the pressure is so\r\nreduced that it has little or no effect; the gases are still trying to\r\nexpand, however, so the exhaust valve is opened at that point, and they\r\nbegin to escape.\r\n\r\n=Exhaust Stroke.=—During the exhaust stroke (No. 4, Fig. 1) the piston\r\nmoves inward and the exhaust valve is open. This movement of the piston\r\npushes the burned gases out of the cylinder, and it is clear that the\r\nmore thoroughly the cylinder is emptied of them, the more room there\r\nwill be for a fresh charge.\r\n\r\nIn high-speed engines the gases cannot escape as fast as the piston\r\nmoves; they are still flowing out when the end of the stroke is\r\nreached. Therefore the valve is closed, not at the end of the stroke,\r\nbut when the piston has moved about ⅛ inch outward on the inlet stroke.\r\nThe inlet valve opens as the exhaust valve closes.\r\n\r\nIt can be seen that through the inlet and compression strokes a leak\r\nwill reduce the charge and so interfere with the production of full\r\npower. The piston must make a tight fit in the cylinder, the valves\r\nmust seat tightly, and gaskets and other parts must be in proper\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.—1-CYLINDER POWER DIAGRAM]\r\n\r\nFigure 2 shows a power diagram for a 1-cylinder engine, in which the\r\ncrank shaft moves under power during one stroke out of every four. An\r\nengine with two cylinders can be built so that first one cylinder\r\napplies power and then the other, in which case the crank shaft moves\r\nunder power during two strokes out of every four.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.—2-CYLINDER POWER DIAGRAM]\r\n\r\nFigure 3 is a power diagram of an engine of this sort. If piston 1 is\r\nmoving down under power, piston 2 is also moving down, but on the inlet\r\nstroke. The following stroke is exhaust in cylinder 1 and compression\r\nin cylinder 2, and cylinder 2 will then deliver a power stroke while\r\ncylinder 1 is on inlet. Thus the crank shaft will receive a power\r\nstroke, followed by a dead stroke; then another power stroke and\r\nanother dead stroke, and so on.\r\n\r\nThere will be the disadvantage, however, that the pistons, moving up\r\nand down together, will cause vibration, which in the course of time\r\nwill be likely to give trouble. To overcome this, a 2-cylinder engine\r\ncan be built as indicated in Figure 4.\r\n\r\nIn this engine the cranks project on opposite sides of the crank shaft\r\ninstead of on the same side, as in Figure 3; the pistons thus move in\r\nopposite directions, and produce no vibration. Power will be unevenly\r\napplied, however, for both power strokes occur in one revolution, with\r\ntwo dead strokes in the succeeding revolution.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.—2-CYLINDER POWER DIAGRAM, 180 SHAFT]\r\n\r\nWith piston 1 moving down on power, piston 2, moving upward, can only\r\nbe performing compression or exhaust. If it is on compression, its\r\npower stroke will follow the power stroke of piston 1, while if it is\r\non exhaust its power stroke will have occurred immediately before the\r\npower stroke of piston 1. In either case one power stroke follows the\r\nother, taking place in one revolution of the crank shaft, while in the\r\nfollowing revolution both pistons will be performing dead strokes.\r\n\r\nWhile there is no vibration from the movement of the pistons in this\r\nengine, the uneven production of power will produce vibration of\r\nanother kind.\r\n\r\nThese two types may be built with the cylinders standing up or lying\r\ndown; that is, they may be either _vertical engines_ or _horizontal\r\nengines_. The _double opposed_ engine, which is built only in horizontal\r\nform, is free from either kind of vibration, but has the disadvantage\r\nof occupying more room than the others. The cylinders, instead of being\r\nside by side, and on the same side of the crank shaft, are placed end\r\nto end, with the crank shaft between them, as shown in Figure 5.\r\n\r\nThe pistons make their inward and outward strokes together, but in so\r\ndoing they move in opposite directions. Thus every power stroke is\r\nfollowed by a dead stroke, as in the engine shown in Figure 3, while\r\nthe movement of one piston balances that of the other, as is the case\r\nwith the engine shown in Figure 4.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.—H. D. O. POWER DIAGRAM]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.—4-CYLINDER POWER DIAGRAM]\r\n\r\nIn a 4-cylinder engine one power stroke follows another without any\r\ndead stroke intervals, which, of course, makes the crank shaft revolve\r\nmore smoothly and with a steadier application of power. The power\r\ndiagram is shown in Figure 6; in studying this it should be remembered\r\nthat if two pistons move in opposite directions, as in Figure 4,\r\none power stroke follows another, while if they move in the same\r\ndirection, as in Figure 3, there is an interval of one stroke between\r\ntheir power strokes.\r\n\r\nThe crank shaft of a 4-cylinder engine is so made that the middle\r\npistons move in the same direction, and opposite to the end pistons.\r\nThis construction has been found to make a smoother running engine than\r\nif pistons 1 and 3 moved one way while pistons 2 and 4 moved the other.\r\n\r\nIf piston 1 is on the power stroke, either piston 2 or piston 3 can\r\nfollow, for they are moving in the opposite direction. If we say that\r\npiston 2 is the next, then piston 4 must be the third to give a power\r\nstroke, for it is the only one left that is moving in the opposite\r\ndirection to piston 2. Piston 3 is thus the fourth to move under power,\r\nand it is followed by another power stroke by piston 1; the _firing\r\norder_ is then said to be 1, 2, 4, 3.\r\n\r\nIf it is piston 3 that follows piston 1, piston 4 will again be the\r\nthird to produce power, and piston 2 will be the fourth. The firing\r\norder will then be 1, 3, 4, 2. There is no other order in which a\r\n4-cylinder engine can produce power, and there is no choice between\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe firing order of an engine is established by the manufacturer, and\r\ndepends on the order in which the valves are operated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nENGINE PARTS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe foundation of an engine is the _base_, which supports the\r\n_bearings_ in which the crank shaft revolves, and to which the\r\ncylinders are attached. The cylinders of tractor engines are made\r\nof cast-iron, and the cylinder heads, which close the upper ends of\r\nthe cylinders, are usually in a separate piece, bolted on. The joint\r\nbetween the cylinders and the cylinder head is made tight by placing\r\nbetween them a _gasket_ of asbestos and thin sheet metal.\r\n\r\nThe crank shaft has as many cranks, or _throws_, as the engine has\r\ncylinders. Crank shafts for 2-cylinder engines are shown in Figure 7;\r\nthe upper one is for an engine of the type shown in Figure 3, with\r\npistons moving in the same direction. With both cranks projecting from\r\none side the shaft is out of balance, so _balance weights_ are attached\r\nto the opposite side.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.—2-CYLINDER CRANK SHAFT]\r\n\r\nThe other shaft shown in Figure 7 does not need balance weights, for\r\none crank balances the other. A four-cylinder crank shaft, Figure 8, is\r\nalso in balance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.—4-CYLINDER CRANK SHAFT]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.—HALF OF A PLAIN BEARING]\r\n\r\nCrank shafts revolve in _main bearings_, which are set in the engine\r\nbase. In tractor engines these are usually _plain bearings_, a half of\r\nsuch a bearing being shown in Figure 9. This is a bronze shell lined\r\nwith a softer metal, making an exact fit on the shaft; with the two\r\nhalves in place, the shaft should turn freely, but without looseness or\r\nside play. The grooves shown are to admit lubricating oil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.—CONNECTING ROD BEARINGS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.—PISTON COMPLETE AND IN SECTION]\r\n\r\nThe _piston_ is attached to the crank shaft by a _connecting rod_,\r\nwhich is illustrated in Figure 10. Pistons are shown in Figures 11 and\r\n12; they are made as light as is consistent with the pressure that they\r\nmust bear, and are hollow, and open at the lower end.\r\n\r\nThe piston is attached to the connecting rod by a _wrist pin_, or\r\n_piston pin_, which is a shaft passing through it from side to side,\r\nand also through the bearing in the upper end of the connecting rod.\r\nThe connecting rod swings on the wrist pin in following the rotation of\r\nthe crank shaft, and its attachment to the wrist pin must permit this\r\nwithout being loose.\r\n\r\nThe bearings at the two ends of a connecting rod are usually\r\nadjustable, so that wear can be taken up; some of the methods of\r\ndoing this are illustrated in Figure 10. In A, the wrist pin bearing\r\nis a plain tube, ground to an exact fit; when it is worn it must be\r\nreplaced. In B, the bearing is split, and the ends are drawn together\r\nby a bolt to the correct fit. The bearing in C is in two parts, held\r\ntogether by a U-shaped bolt, while in D the two parts are held together\r\nby a cap bolted to the end of the connecting rod. In E, the end of the\r\nconnecting rod is a square loop enclosing the two parts of the bearing;\r\nthe parts are held in the proper position by a wedge adjusted by screws.\r\n\r\nThe crank shaft bearing of the connecting rod shown in F is in two\r\nparts which are hinged together. G, H, and K show the forms usually\r\nused in tractor engines, which consist of two parts bolted together.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.—WRIST PIN FASTENINGS]\r\n\r\nThe wrist pin is usually firmly attached to the piston, so that the\r\nconnecting rod swings on it; methods of securing the wrist pin are\r\nshown in Figure 12, the wrist pin being held in supports cast in the\r\npiston. In A, the wrist pin is held by two set screws, and in B, by\r\npins passing through it. The wrist pin shown in D is hollow, as is very\r\ncommon, and a bolt passes through part of the piston and into the wrist\r\npin.\r\n\r\nIn the construction shown in C the wrist pin is secured to the\r\nconnecting rod and moves in bearings in the piston. In E, a ring\r\nfitting in a groove around the piston prevents the wrist pin from\r\nmoving endways.\r\n\r\nThe engine must usually be taken to pieces in order to get at the wrist\r\npin; lock nuts, lock washers or cotter pins are always used to prevent\r\nthe trouble that would be caused if the wrist pin worked loose.\r\n\r\nA leak-proof joint between the piston and the cylinder is made by means\r\nof _piston rings_ that fit in grooves around the piston, as shown in\r\nE, Figure 12. Piston ring grooves are shown in Figure 11. Piston rings\r\nare not solid, but are split so that they are elastic; they fit snugly\r\nin their grooves, and tend to spring open to a greater size than\r\nthe cylinder. This causes them to maintain a close fit against the\r\ncylinder, and the gases are prevented from leaking past.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.—VALVE]\r\n\r\nEach cylinder is provided with two valves: the _inlet valve_ that\r\nadmits fresh mixture and the _exhaust valve_ through which the burned\r\ngases escape. These valves are metal disks with funnel-shaped edges\r\nfitting into funnel holes. A valve and its stem are shown in Figure 13\r\nand also in Figure 15.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.—ACTION OF A CAM]\r\n\r\nA valve is opened at the proper time by a _cam_, and closed by a\r\nspring. A cam is a wheel with a bulge on one side, so that its rim is\r\neccentric to its shaft, as illustrated in Figure 14, which shows a cam\r\nin three positions of a revolution. A rod resting on the rim of the\r\ncam is moved endways as the bulge passes under it, and the valve is\r\noperated by connecting it with the rod.\r\n\r\nA valve is opened once during two revolutions of the crank shaft;\r\ntherefore the cam cannot be placed on the crank shaft, for, if it\r\nwere, the valve would be opened every revolution. The cam is placed on\r\na separate shaft which is driven by the crank shaft at half its speed.\r\nThis is usually done with gears, a gear on the crank shaft meshing with\r\na gear on the cam shaft having twice as many teeth; the crank shaft\r\ngear must make two revolutions in turning the cam shaft gear once.\r\n\r\nThe valve in Figure 13 is held on its seat by a spring. The cam bears\r\nagainst the end of the valve stem, and as it revolves its bulge forces\r\nthe valve stem and valve to move endways and thus to uncover the valve\r\nopening.\r\n\r\nAs the movement of the piston depends on the crank shaft, the valve can\r\nbe made to open at the right time by a proper setting of the gears that\r\ndrive the cam shaft.\r\n\r\nThe length of time that the cam will hold the valve open depends on\r\nthe shape of the bulge of the cam. It can be seen that the pointed cam\r\nof Figure 13 will not hold the valve open for as long a time as the\r\nflat-end cam of Figure 14.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.—“TWIN CITY” TRACTOR ENGINE]\r\n\r\nIn the design shown in Figure 13 the cam bears directly against the\r\nend of the valve stem, the cam shaft in this case lying along the\r\ncylinder head. In the construction shown in Figure 15 the valves are\r\nnot placed in the cylinder head, but are in an extension or _valve\r\npocket_ projecting from the combustion chamber; this cam shaft is near\r\nthe crank shaft. It would not be practicable to make the valve stem\r\nlong enough to reach down to the cam, so a length of rod, called a\r\n_push rod_, or _tappet_, is placed between them; the cam moves the push\r\nrod and the push rod in turn moves the valve. This is a construction\r\nfrequently used for automobile engines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.—“HART-PARR” VALVE MECHANISM]\r\n\r\nIn tractor engines the cam shaft is usually placed near the crank\r\nshaft, as in Figure 15, and the valves are in the head, so that a valve\r\nmoves in the opposite direction to the movement of the push rod. This\r\nrequires still another part to be used, called the _rocker arm_. It is\r\nshown in Figure 16. It is a short bar, pivoted at or near the center,\r\nwith one end at the push rod and the other at the valve stem. When it\r\nis moved by the push rod it in turn moves the valve.\r\n\r\nValves operated by push rods and rocker arms are also shown in Figures\r\n17, 18 and 19; Figure 18 is a single-cylinder horizontal engine, while\r\nFigure 19 is a horizontal double opposed engine, in which one cam\r\noperates a valve in each cylinder. Figure 20 shows the valve mechanism\r\nof a vertical engine in which all parts, including the rocker arm, are\r\nenclosed to protect them from dust, and so they can run in oil.\r\n\r\nA small space is always left somewhere between the cam and the valve\r\nstem, to give the valve stem room to lengthen, which it will do when it\r\ngets hot. If this space were not left, the valve stem, in lengthening\r\nas it became hot, would strike the part next to it, and the valve would\r\nbe lifted from its seat. This would cause the engine to lose power.\r\nThis space must be kept properly adjusted, and instructions for this\r\nwill be found in Chapter XII.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.—“HART-PARR” ENGINE]\r\n\r\nA valve is held against its seat by a spring, which must be compressed\r\nwhen the valve is opened. If this spring is too weak, it will not hold\r\nthe valve tightly on its seat, while if it is too stiff, the cam shaft\r\nand other parts will be needlessly strained in compressing it.\r\n\r\nFriction between the cam and the end of the valve stem or push rod\r\nwould cause rapid wear if these parts were not of hardened steel, and\r\nkept well oiled. Still further to reduce wear, there is usually a\r\nroller on the end of the push rod, as shown in Figure 16 and some of\r\nthe other illustrations. Figure 15 shows a construction in which the\r\nend of the push rod is a flat disk, which rotates as the cam comes into\r\ncontact with it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.—“OIL-PULL” ENGINE]\r\n\r\nWhen the mixture burns, the top of the piston, the cylinder head, and\r\nthe walls of the combustion chamber become heated, and if it is not\r\nprevented they will get so hot that they will expand sufficiently to\r\ncause the piston to stick, or _seize_. The upper part of the cylinder\r\nis, therefore, provided with a cooling system that keeps these parts\r\nfrom getting overheated. Channels are provided through which water is\r\ncirculated; the water takes the heat from the metal parts, becoming\r\nheated itself, and then passes to a _cooler_, or _radiator_, where it\r\ngives up the heat to currents of air.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the channels, or _water jackets_, around the cylinder,\r\na cooling system includes the radiator, the connections, and usually a\r\npump that keeps the water in motion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.—HORIZONTAL DOUBLE OPPOSED ENGINE]\r\n\r\nIn some tractors, notably the Fordson, no pump is used; the water\r\ncirculates because it is heated. This is called a _thermo-syphon_\r\nsystem. When the engine runs, the water in the cylinder jackets becomes\r\nheated; as hot water is lighter than cold water, it rises and flows out\r\nof the jackets to the radiator, its place being taken by cool water\r\nfrom the bottom of the radiator. This circulation continues as long as\r\nthe water in one part of the system is hotter than the water in some\r\nother part of the system.\r\n\r\nThe lubrication of an engine is described and explained in Chapter X.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.—“MONARCH” ENGINE]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nFUELS AND CARBURETION\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order that a thing may burn, it must be provided with oxygen. Oxygen\r\nis found in air, so it is usual to say that air is necessary in order\r\nthat anything may burn.\r\n\r\nTo prove this, light a candle and place an empty bottle over it, upside\r\ndown; in a very short time the oxygen in the bottle will be used up,\r\nand the flame will flicker and get smoky, and finally die out. If a\r\ncard is laid on the chimney of a coal-oil lamp so that it covers the\r\nopening, that flame also will flicker, get smoky and go out.\r\n\r\nIn order to deaden the fire in a stove, the dampers are closed to\r\nprevent air from entering; the fire is kept alight by the very small\r\nquantity of air that leaks in below the fire-box. When the drafts are\r\nopened the fire will burn up brightly because a plentiful volume of air\r\ncan then enter.\r\n\r\nIn a similar way, air must be used in a gas engine in order that the\r\nfuel may burn. It is not possible to mix air with a liquid; the first\r\nstep in making a gas that will burn is, therefore, to turn the fuel,\r\nwhether it is gasoline, kerosene, distillate, or other oil, into a\r\nvapor; this vapor is then mixed with air.\r\n\r\nFor good results it is very necessary that the vapor and air be in\r\nproper proportions. In the experiment with the candle and the bottle it\r\nwas seen that as the air was used up, the candle flame became yellow\r\nand smoky: this is the effect of insufficient air. If there is not\r\nenough air in the mixture, part of the vapor will not be able to burn,\r\nand will only smoke.\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, there is too much air, the mixture, if it will\r\nburn at all, will burn slowly, and the extra volume of air will reduce\r\nthe heat.\r\n\r\nIn a mixture of the proper proportions of air and fuel vapor, the\r\nburning, or _combustion_, will be very rapid, resulting in the sudden\r\nproduction of the greatest possible amount of heat. This, of course, is\r\nwhat is necessary if the engine is to produce its fullest power. With\r\nsuch a mixture, combustion will be complete before the piston has done\r\nmore than start outward on the power stroke, and the greatest possible,\r\nor _maximum_, pressure will then be produced.\r\n\r\nWhen a mixture burns slowly, the piston will have gone through much\r\nof the power stroke before combustion is complete, in which case a\r\nconsiderable part of the pressure that should have been applied at the\r\nbeginning of the stroke will be wasted.\r\n\r\nA mixture that is not correct will burn unevenly; it may burn better\r\nduring one power stroke than during another, which will make the engine\r\nrun unsteadily.\r\n\r\nIf the mixture has too much air in proportion to the amount of vapor,\r\nit is known as a _thin_ mixture, or a _lean_ or _poor_ mixture. It\r\nburns so slowly that it is quite possible for the mixture that started\r\nburning before the beginning of the power stroke to continue burning\r\nthrough the exhaust stroke, and for enough flame to remain in the\r\ncylinder to set fire to the fresh charge that enters during the next\r\ninlet stroke. This will produce what is known as a _backfire_; that is,\r\nthe mixture entering the cylinder will catch fire, and in burning will\r\nblow back through the open inlet valve. This is a dangerous condition,\r\nfor the flame might spread to fuel dripping from the carburetor, or to\r\nthe fuel tank.\r\n\r\nA mixture that has not enough air is called a _rich_ mixture; the air\r\nthat is present will burn part of the vapor, while the rest will go out\r\nof the exhaust unburned, or will work past the piston into the oil in\r\nthe crank case. This is wasteful of fuel.\r\n\r\nThe most serious result of a rich mixture, however, is in the\r\nproduction of _carbon_, and the _carbonization_ of the engine. The\r\nflame of a rich mixture is smoky; the smoke of this flame, as is the\r\ncase with smoke from all other sources, is composed of fine particles\r\nof carbon, or soot. These particles of carbon will deposit on all parts\r\nof the combustion space: on the top of the piston, on the valves, on\r\nthe spark plugs, and on the inner wall of the cylinder head. At first\r\nit is gummy, but it rapidly hardens and forms a crust that must be\r\nscraped off with a steel tool.\r\n\r\nCarbon in an engine will reduce the power through causing\r\n_preignition_, or, in other words, by setting fire to the fresh charge\r\nbefore the proper point in the stroke. The heat of the combustion will\r\ncause the carbon deposit to become so heated that it will glow, these\r\nglowing particles being sufficient to ignite the incoming fresh charge.\r\nThe remedy for this condition is to remove the carbon, which is usually\r\ndone by taking off the cylinder head and scraping away the deposit.\r\n\r\nIt may be added that carbon is also formed by the use of too much\r\nlubricating oil, as will be explained in the chapter on lubrication.\r\n\r\nThus it is seen that if the engine is to run properly, and is to be\r\nkept in good condition, the proportions of the mixture must be very\r\ncarefully maintained.\r\n\r\nThe mixture is formed in a _carburetor_, or _mixer_. This is, roughly,\r\nin the form of a tube through which air is sucked during the inlet\r\nstroke; projecting into it is a fine tube called a _spray nozzle_\r\nthrough which the fuel enters. In action it is somewhat similar to the\r\natomizer that is used for spraying the nose and throat. By forcing the\r\nfuel to flow rapidly through this small tube it comes out in the form\r\nof spray, and the tiny drops are picked up by the current of air and\r\nare carried into the cylinder.\r\n\r\nIt is much easier to form a mixture of gasoline than of kerosene or\r\ndistillate, because gasoline vaporizes more readily at ordinary\r\ntemperatures. If saucers of gasoline and kerosene are placed in the\r\nsun, the gasoline will evaporate rapidly and completely, leaving only\r\na faint oily deposit. The kerosene, on the other hand, will evaporate\r\nslowly, and much of it will not evaporate at all.\r\n\r\nTo make kerosene and distillate evaporate completely, they must be\r\nheated, just as water must be heated to make it evaporate.\r\n\r\nIn the case of a carburetor for gasoline, the current of air needs\r\nonly to be warmed; the spray of gasoline will evaporate on coming into\r\ncontact with the warmed air, and much of it will enter the cylinder as\r\nvapor. In order to evaporate kerosene and distillate much more heat\r\nmust be provided, and it is usually considered necessary to heat not\r\nonly the current of air, but the liquid fuel as well. Methods of doing\r\nthis will be explained in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21.—PRINCIPLE OF CARBURETOR]\r\n\r\nWhen kerosene or distillate is used, there are conditions that make\r\nit necessary to add water vapor to the mixture, which prevents the\r\noverheating of the cylinder and reduces the deposit of carbon. The\r\ndifficulty of making a complete vapor of kerosene and distillate\r\nresults in a tendency on the part of these fuels to carbonize the\r\ncylinders; the use of water aids in keeping the cylinders clean.\r\n\r\nThe general principle of a carburetor is shown in Figure 21, one\r\ndrawing illustrating conditions when the inlet valve is closed and the\r\nother when it is open. It shows an engine cylinder connected with an\r\ninlet pipe or _mixing chamber_, through which there is a swift flow of\r\nair during an inlet stroke.\r\n\r\nProjecting into the intake pipe is the _spray nozzle_, which is\r\nconnected with a small chamber containing fuel; inside of this chamber\r\nis a _float_, usually made of cork, although it is sometimes a light\r\nmetal box. The fuel is intended to fill the chamber to a certain\r\nheight, at which the valve will be closed by the float rising on the\r\nfuel. This level is such that the fuel does not quite reach the tip of\r\nthe spray nozzle.\r\n\r\nDuring the compression, power, and exhaust strokes, the fuel stands at\r\nthis level, for it cannot run out of the spray nozzle, and the float\r\nholds the valve closed. As soon as the inlet valve opens, air rushes\r\nthrough the intake pipe and sucks fuel out of the spray nozzle. This,\r\nof course, takes fuel out of the float chamber; the float in sinking\r\nopens the valve, and enough fuel enters to restore the level.\r\n\r\nThe fuel comes out of the nozzle in the form of fine spray; it is in\r\nsuch small drops that it evaporates quickly, and the resulting mixture\r\nof fuel vapor and air passes into the cylinder. By using a spray nozzle\r\nof the proper size, any desired proportion of fuel and air may be\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\nIf an engine runs at a single speed, a carburetor as simple as this one\r\nwould be satisfactory, for if the suction is always the same, there\r\nwill be little or no change in the proportions of the mixture that is\r\nformed.\r\n\r\nTo get the best results, the proportions of fuel vapor and air should\r\nbe the same for all running speeds of the engine. The proportions of\r\nthe mixture, however, depend on the violence of the suction, which\r\nchanges as the engine speed changes, becoming greater as the speed\r\nincreases. The simple carburetor illustrated in Figure 21 can be\r\nadjusted to give a correct mixture for any particular speed, but will\r\nbe out of adjustment for any other speed.\r\n\r\nThe speed of a 1-cylinder engine does not change very greatly; it is\r\nbuilt to run at practically a constant speed, and a simple carburetor\r\nis satisfactory for it. The speed of engines with a greater number of\r\ncylinders may be greatly changed, and the carburetor must be so made\r\nthat it will give the same proportions of vapor and air at low speed as\r\nat high.\r\n\r\nIn the simple carburetor described, the speeding-up of the engine will\r\nresult in a greater rush of air through the intake pipe, which in turn\r\nwill suck out a much greater quantity of fuel. If the carburetor is\r\nadjusted to give the proper quantity of fuel for the air that passes\r\nat low speed, at high speed it will give far more fuel than will be\r\nrequired by the quantity of air that then passes. Thus at high speed\r\nthe mixture will be too rich.\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, this carburetor is adjusted to give a proper\r\nmixture at high speed, too little fuel will be sucked out when the\r\nengine runs slowly, and the mixture will be too lean.\r\n\r\nA carburetor must thus have an additional device that will keep the\r\nmixture correct, regardless of the speed at which the engine runs.\r\nThis is sometimes done by changing the size of the spray nozzle so\r\nthat a greater or less quantity of fuel flows out, but more usually\r\nby permitting an extra quantity of air to enter the carburetor as\r\nthe engine speeds up. This is done with an _extra air intake_, the\r\nprinciple of which is illustrated in Figure 22.\r\n\r\nAs will be seen, this carburetor has two openings for air, one being\r\nthe main air inlet and the other the extra air inlet. The latter is an\r\nopening provided with a valve which is held on its seat by a spring.\r\nThe suction created by an inlet stroke is exerted in the carburetor,\r\nbut at low speed is not sufficient to suck the extra air valve from its\r\nseat. Air then enters only through the main air inlet, and the spray\r\nnozzle is adjusted to give the proper proportion of fuel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.—PRINCIPLE OF EXTRA AIR INLET]\r\n\r\nAs the engine speed increases the mixture becomes richer; but there\r\nis also an increase in suction, which becomes strong enough to pull\r\nthe extra air valve from its seat. This provides another opening into\r\nthe carburetor, through which enough air enters to keep the mixture\r\nin proper proportion. The higher the speed of the engine the more the\r\nvalve will open, and the greater will be the quantity of air admitted.\r\n\r\nIn order to get the fullest power from an engine, the carburetor is\r\nbuilt to give its most perfect mixture at the usual working speed.\r\nThis will be the speed at which the engine will run under ordinary\r\nconditions. As the engine will run at this speed most of the time, the\r\ncarburetor should then deliver its best mixture on the least possible\r\nquantity of fuel.\r\n\r\nAs an engine is run at low speed so little of the time, it is not\r\nnecessary that the mixture should then be so perfect or that the fuel\r\nshould be used so economically.\r\n\r\nThe design of a carburetor is a complicated matter, because the\r\nproduction of mixture is due to the flow of air, which is a very\r\nchangeable thing. On a cold, damp day, the air will be heavier and\r\ndenser than on a day that is hot and dry, and different quantities of\r\nfuel will be necessary for the formation of the mixture. The carburetor\r\nmanufacturer cannot make a commercial carburetor that will take care\r\nof such a difference as this; he strikes an average that gives good\r\ngeneral results, and expects the user to change the adjustments when\r\nweather and temperature make it necessary.\r\n\r\nThe formation of the mixture is affected by the condition of the\r\nengine. When all of the parts of the engine are tight, the suction in\r\nthe carburetor is more violent than when there is a leakage of air past\r\nthe piston rings, or through a leaky valve or spark plug.\r\n\r\nOn a dry, hot day the fuel evaporates much more readily than on a\r\nday that is cold and damp; more of the fuel that flows out of the\r\nspray nozzle will be vaporized and the formation of the mixture will\r\nbe easier. On a cold, damp day the fuel will not vaporize in the\r\ncarburetor to any extent, and much of it will pass to the cylinder in\r\ndrops that even there will not vaporize in time to form a mixture.\r\nIn order to assure the vaporization of enough fuel to form a mixture\r\nunder such conditions, the fuel and the air must be heated to a greater\r\ndegree.\r\n\r\nAs the engine becomes heated up, more and more of the fuel will\r\nvaporize, and the amount flowing out of the spray nozzle may therefore\r\nbe cut down.\r\n\r\nWith fuels like kerosene and distillate, which do not vaporize as\r\nreadily as gasoline, it is not unusual to have them condense on the\r\nwalls of the inlet pipe, which produces a condition known as _loading_.\r\nThis condensation is similar to the sweating of an ice-water pitcher\r\non a hot day. If an engine is running at a constant speed, loading\r\ndoes not make much difference, because the carburetor is so adjusted\r\nthat it gives a proper mixture. If the engine is suddenly speeded up,\r\nhowever, the greater rush of air will pick up the condensed fuel, and\r\nthe mixture will instantly become too rich, continuing so until this\r\nextra supply of fuel is used up. The result will be to choke the engine\r\nand make it lose power just at the time when extra power is needed.\r\n\r\nLoading can be prevented by heating the inlet pipe to such an extent\r\nthat the fuel will not condense on it.\r\n\r\nThe speed of a tractor engine is practically always controlled by a\r\n_throttle_, which is a valve set in the passage of the carburetor.\r\nIt operates exactly the same as a damper in a stovepipe; when it is\r\nclosed, it shuts the passage and prevents the flow of mixture to the\r\nengine. As it is opened, it permits a greater quantity of mixture to\r\nflow, and it follows, of course, that as the charges of mixture become\r\nlarger, the engine runs with more power. A tractor carburetor usually\r\nhas two throttles, one being operated by hand and the other by the\r\ngovernor.\r\n\r\nIt is usual for a carburetor to be fitted with a _strangler_, or\r\n_choke_, which makes it easier to form a mixture at slow starting\r\nspeed. When an engine is cold, the fuel evaporates slowly; and,\r\nfurthermore, when an engine is cranked by hand its speed is so low that\r\nthe suction in the carburetor is not sufficient to draw out enough fuel\r\nto form a mixture. The strangler is a valve similar in every way to the\r\nthrottle, but placed between the main air inlet and the spray nozzle.\r\nWhen it is closed and the engine is cranked, very little air can enter\r\nthe carburetor; the suction is therefore very great. Far more fuel\r\nthan usual is then sucked out of the spray nozzle, and of this greater\r\namount enough reaches the cylinder to form a combustible mixture. The\r\nengine will start, but as soon as it does so, the strangler must be\r\nopened so that the normal amount of air enters. If this is not done,\r\nthe excessive suction will draw so much fuel out of the spray nozzle\r\nthat the mixture formed will be too rich to burn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nCARBURETORS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe apparatus that forms the mixture is in two parts, one being the\r\ncarburetor that proportions the fuel to the quantity of air drawn into\r\nthe cylinder, and the other the _mixing chamber_, or _manifold_, that\r\nconnects the carburetor with the valve chamber. The mixing chamber has\r\nno adjustments; it is a passage, often a pipe, that is shaped to fit\r\nthe conditions, and according to the ideas of the manufacturer. When\r\nkerosene and distillate are used, the mixing chamber must be heated, so\r\nit is frequently built into the _exhaust manifold_, which is the pipe\r\nthat conducts the burned gases away from the engine. In some cases it\r\ngets heat from the water jacket of the engine, a water jacket formed\r\naround it being connected with the cooling system.\r\n\r\nThe carburetor, on the other hand, has adjustments that must be\r\nunderstood in order to run the engine economically. The understanding\r\nof these adjustments is simplified if it is remembered that the object\r\nof the carburetor is to maintain a correct proportion of fuel to the\r\nvolume of air that passes through it.\r\n\r\nAll tractor carburetors operate on the same principles, and the\r\nprinciples are applied in much the same way. If these principles are\r\nunderstood, and there is an understanding of what the parts of a\r\ncarburetor are for and what they do, there should be no difficulty in\r\nadjusting and caring for any kind of a carburetor that may be offered.\r\n\r\nThe main body of the carburetor is the tube through which the air\r\npasses. This is a casting, and cannot be adjusted or altered. Into this\r\npassage projects the spray nozzle, which is usually provided with an\r\nadjustment to control the amount of liquid that may flow out of it.\r\nWhen no adjustment is provided, the spray nozzle is made removable, so\r\nthat a nozzle with an opening of any desired size may be inserted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23.—“KINGSTON” CARBURETOR, MODEL L]\r\n\r\nOn some carburetors the extra air valve is set by the manufacturers,\r\nwhile on others it is adjustable by controlling the strength of the\r\nspring that holds it against its seat.\r\n\r\nThe carburetor shown in Figure 23 has a spray nozzle adjustment of a\r\nvery usual type. A rod is so arranged that its pointed end projects\r\ninto the opening of the spray nozzle; by screwing it up or down the\r\nopening may be made larger or smaller, so that more or less fuel may\r\nflow out. The extra air valve is a flap valve that closes the air\r\npassage until the suction is great enough to lift it from its seat.\r\nAround the spray nozzle is a tube that connects the passage below the\r\nextra air valve with the passage above it; when the suction is too low\r\nto lift the extra air valve from its seat, any air flowing through the\r\ncarburetor passes through this tube. The tube is so small that even a\r\nlittle air passing through it is enough to suck fuel out of the spray\r\nnozzle, and the spray nozzle is so adjusted that enough fuel comes out\r\nto make a proper mixture with that volume of air.\r\n\r\nThis is the _low-speed adjustment_, which gives a mixture on which the\r\nengine will start and will run at its lowest or _idling_ speed. At this\r\nspeed the engine produces just enough power to keep itself going.\r\n\r\nWhen the engine speeds up, and suction increases, the extra air valve\r\nis lifted off its seat, and a greater volume of air flows through the\r\ncarburetor. The increased suction also draws more fuel out of the spray\r\nnozzle. If the greater amount of fuel were in proportion to the greater\r\nvolume of air, there would be no change in the mixture, but this is not\r\nthe case. As suction increases, the proportion of fuel drawn out of the\r\nspray nozzle becomes too great for the air, and the mixture becomes too\r\nrich. To overcome this, the extra air valve permits a still greater\r\nvolume of air to pass, so that the proportions of fuel and air do not\r\nchange.\r\n\r\nThe chamber below the air passage in Figure 22 is the fuel cup, into\r\nwhich fuel flows from the tank. Inside the fuel cup is a ring of cork\r\nattached to a pivoted lever, on the other end of which is a needle\r\nvalve that can close the opening through which the fuel enters the cup.\r\nAs the cup fills, the cork floats on it, and in rising it moves the\r\nlever on its pivot. When the fuel reaches such a level that it is near\r\nthe tip of the spray nozzle, the valve closes the opening and prevents\r\nmore fuel from entering.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24.—“KINGSTON” CARBURETOR, MODEL E]\r\n\r\nIn the carburetor shown in Figure 24, the principal air passage is past\r\nthe spray nozzle, and all air goes by this passage when the engine\r\nis running at low speed. The extra air inlet consists of a number of\r\nholes through which air can pass without going past the spray nozzle.\r\nOn each of these holes is a ball; when the suction is low the balls\r\ncompletely close the holes. When speed increases, the suction becomes\r\ngreat enough to lift the balls off the holes, and the extra volume of\r\nair that is necessary is permitted to enter. By making the balls of\r\ndifferent weights, it can be seen that the volume of air admitted for\r\nany speed is under good control.\r\n\r\nLike the carburetor shown in Figure 23, this carburetor is of the\r\n_float feed_ type; that is, the flow of fuel to it is controlled by a\r\nvalve that is operated by a float.\r\n\r\nEither of these two carburetors may be adjusted for gasoline or for\r\nkerosene, but the adjustment that is right for one is wrong for the\r\nother. Thus, if an engine is started on gasoline, with the intention of\r\nrunning on kerosene, the carburetor must be readjusted when the change\r\nis made. This is unsatisfactory, so a double carburetor is sometimes\r\nused, as shown in Figure 25. This consists of two carburetors of the\r\nkind shown in Figure 24, having a single mixture outlet, one being\r\nadjusted for gasoline and the other for kerosene. Either of them can be\r\nconnected with the mixture outlet by means of a switch valve.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.—“KINGSTON” CARBURETOR, DUAL MODEL]\r\n\r\nIn order to run on kerosene or distillate it is necessary to apply heat\r\nfor the reason that these oils do not evaporate readily at ordinary\r\ntemperatures. Gasoline, on the other hand, evaporates readily, and a\r\ncold engine can be started on it. Tractors that run on kerosene or\r\ndistillate are therefore started on gasoline and run on it until they\r\nare hot enough to vaporize the heavier oil.\r\n\r\nA carburetor that will run on either gasoline or kerosene is shown in\r\nFigure 26. The main air inlet is at E, which leads the air around the\r\nspray nozzle and into the chamber G. The mixture flows to the cylinder\r\nby the passage B. The control of the fuel at working speeds is by the\r\nhigh-speed adjustment, which is a needle valve screwing into the spray\r\nnozzle. Above this is another needle valve that adjusts the flow of\r\nfuel for slow speed.\r\n\r\nExtra air enters through the opening A, which is closed at slow speed\r\nby a valve held against it by a spring. This valve bears against one\r\nend of a pivoted lever, the other end of which is attached to the\r\nslow-speed needle valve; when the extra air valve opens it moves the\r\nlever and the slow-speed needle valve is lifted to permit the flow of a\r\ngreater volume of fuel from the spray nozzle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.—“E-B” CARBURETOR]\r\n\r\nThis carburetor is started on gasoline. When the engine is hot, a\r\nswitch valve is operated to permit the burned gases from the engine to\r\nflow through the carburetor; they pass through the pipe C, D, and as\r\nthe chamber G is directly in their path it becomes intensely heated.\r\nThe carburetor can then be switched to kerosene. A side view of this\r\ncarburetor is shown in Figure 27.\r\n\r\nThese carburetors are all of the float feed type, and are used on\r\nengines of which the speed is variable. A carburetor that is fed by a\r\npump is shown in Figure 28. This is a simple tube with a fuel cup cast\r\non one side of it. Fuel is pumped to the bowl, and the proper level is\r\nmaintained by an overflow through which excess fuel passes back to the\r\ntank.\r\n\r\nThis carburetor is intended for an engine of which the speed does not\r\nchange greatly. Its only adjustment is the spray nozzle, and this is\r\naltered to correspond with changes in engine speed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27.—“E-B” CARBURETOR, SIDE VIEW]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28.—PUMP-FED CARBURETOR]\r\n\r\nIf an engine is clean and in good condition, it will run as well on\r\nkerosene as on gasoline, although the heating effect of kerosene is\r\ngreater. When an engine is carbonized, as is usually the case, a\r\ncondition known as _preignition_ will occur unless it is prevented.\r\nCarbon from unburned fuel or from lubricating oil will deposit on the\r\npiston head and the parts of the combustion chamber, and particles will\r\nbecome heated to the glowing point, when they will set fire to the\r\nfresh mixture during the compression stroke and before the proper time.\r\nThe effect is to make the engine lose power, and it also gives rise to\r\na sharp metallic knocking. By reducing the temperature in the cylinder\r\nduring the compression stroke this condition can be prevented. This can\r\nbe done by adding water vapor to the mixture, and kerosene carburetors\r\nare therefore built with a water attachment. As can be seen in Figure\r\n28, this is a water cup and spray nozzle like those for the fuel. When\r\nthe engine knocks, and shows that preignition is occurring, water is\r\nturned on, and, being carried into the cylinder, keeps the mixture from\r\nbeing heated to the point of ignition before the proper time.\r\n\r\nFigure 29 shows the attachment of this carburetor to an engine which,\r\nin this case, is horizontal. To start the engine, gasoline is injected\r\ninto the carburetor, as shown; this will give a sufficiently good\r\nmixture for the purpose, and enough heat for running on kerosene is\r\nthus obtained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29.—“TITAN” CARBURETOR]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30.—PUMP-FED CARBURETOR WITH TWO FUEL NOZZLES]\r\n\r\nThe carburetor shown in Figure 30 is similar, but has a bowl and spray\r\nnozzle for gasoline, to use in starting. It is also provided with a\r\nheating jacket through which hot water or hot gases may circulate.\r\n\r\nIn many cases the fuel is heated before reaching the carburetor. This\r\nis done by coiling the feed pipe around the exhaust pipe or putting it\r\nin a jacket through which hot water circulates.\r\n\r\nAnother device sends the mixture through a chamber heated by the\r\nexhaust, as shown in Figure 31. Figure 32 shows an arrangement in which\r\nthe mixture passes through a jacket around one branch of the exhaust\r\npipe. By means of a switch valve, A, more or less of the exhaust gases\r\nmay be permitted to flow through this branch, so that the mixture may\r\nbe heated to any desired degree.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31.—“HART-PARR” MIXTURE HEATER]\r\n\r\nAll of these heating devices are so arranged that the heat is under the\r\ncontrol of the driver, which permits him to heat the mixture as much as\r\nhe judges to be necessary. Enough heat must be used to prevent the fuel\r\nfrom condensing; but too much heat will cut down the efficiency of the\r\nengine because it will cause so much expansion of the mixture that a\r\ncylinderful of it will not produce the maximum power.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32.—“TWIN CITY” MANIFOLD]\r\n\r\nFigure 33 shows the pump that is used in a force feed carburetor of the\r\ntype shown in Figure 28. Its plunger is forced through an inward stroke\r\nby a cam, and makes an outward stroke as its spring returns it to\r\nposition. The inlet and outlet openings of the cylinder are closed by\r\nball check valves, the inlet check being open on the outward strokes,\r\nand the outlet check being open on the inward strokes. A pump of this\r\nsort requires no attention beyond seeing that the check valves work\r\nproperly, and that there are no leaks.\r\n\r\nFigure 34 shows the connections between the fuel tank and the\r\ncarburetor. Under the tank, 1, is a chamber containing a fine wire\r\nstrainer, 4, through which the fuel must pass to reach the carburetor;\r\nany dirt that may be present is strained out, and collects in the cup,\r\n2. Water in the fuel also settles here, and the cup is cleaned out by\r\nunscrewing the plug, 3. 5 is the shut-off cock; it should always be\r\nclosed when the tractor is not working.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 33.—FUEL PUMP]\r\n\r\nA complete fuel system is illustrated in Figure 35, showing the\r\nconnections of the tanks, pumps, and carburetor.\r\n\r\nAs dirt is injurious to an engine, the air that forms the mixture\r\nmust be clean, so when a tractor works in a dusty field, it should be\r\nequipped with an air cleaner, of which there are three kinds. In one\r\nof these the air is required to pass through water, which washes it.\r\nA cleaner of this type is shown in Figure 36. The dusty air enters\r\nthe central passage, and is forced to pass through the water in order\r\nto reach the outlet. Passage through the water and through the baffle\r\nplates frees the air of all its dust.\r\n\r\nIn the cleaner shown in Figure 37, the air is passed through loose\r\nwool, which filters out the dust. Another type of cleaner works on\r\nthe same principle as a cream separator; the air is given a whirling\r\nmotion, which throws the dirt out at the sides, and it is collected in\r\na glass jar.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34.—“AVERY” FUEL CONNECTIONS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 35.—“OIL-PULL” FUEL SYSTEM]\r\n\r\nThese air cleaners must be emptied frequently, for if they are not kept\r\nclean it cannot be expected that they will do their work.\r\n\r\nA tractor engine is built to develop its maximum power at a certain\r\nspeed; if it runs at greater speed, it will not operate efficiently,\r\nand there will be unnecessary wear of its parts. These engines are\r\ntherefore usually fitted with _governors_ which hold them at their most\r\nefficient speed. A governor operates by _centrifugal force_.\r\n\r\nAnything in motion tries to move in a straight line; if it is forced to\r\nmove in a circle, it will exert force in trying to move away from its\r\ncenter. It is this that is called centrifugal force. It is centrifugal\r\nforce that holds water in a pail that is being swung around the head,\r\nand that makes the pail fly off if it is released.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 36.—AIR WASHER]\r\n\r\nIn applying this principle to a governor, weights are attached to a\r\nplate and made to revolve; springs hold them together, but in spite\r\nof this, centrifugal force throws them outward. In moving, they act\r\non a rod that operates the throttle; as the speed increases, the move\r\noutward more and more, and it is a simple matter of adjustment to cause\r\nthem to close the throttle when the speed reaches a desired point.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 37.—AIR STRAINER]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 38.—“E-B” GOVERNOR]\r\n\r\nA governor and its connections are shown in Figure 38. The weights,\r\nR, are L-shaped, and pivoted at the angle to a plate driven by the\r\nengine. The shaft that drives the plate also supports a collar, P, that\r\nis loose on it and can slide endways; the collar rests against the\r\nshort bar of the L-shaped weights. The other end of the collar touches\r\nthe lever, E, which is moved when the collar moves. As the lever is\r\nconnected with the throttle, a movement of the collar will control the\r\nposition of the throttle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 39.—“CASE” GOVERNOR]\r\n\r\nWhen the shaft revolves, the long arms of the L-shaped weights tend\r\nto fly outward; this moves them on their pivots, and the short arms\r\nthereupon force the collar to slide on the shaft, which moves the lever\r\nand operates the throttle. The speed at which the throttle will begin\r\nto close is determined by the setting of the spring that holds the\r\nweights in.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 40.—“HART-PARR” GOVERNOR]\r\n\r\nGovernors and governor connections are shown in Figures 39 and 40.\r\n\r\nThe governor shown in Figure 41 is enclosed in a housing that can\r\nbe locked or sealed. This prevents the unauthorized changing of the\r\nadjustment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 41.—VERTICAL GOVERNOR]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nIGNITION\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order that a gas engine may run properly, the mixture must be set on\r\nfire, or _ignited_, at exactly the right time; if ignition occurs too\r\nearly or too late, there will be a loss of power.\r\n\r\nThe greatest pressure will be obtained at the instant when all of the\r\nmixture is burning, and this should take place just as the piston\r\nbegins to move outward on the power stroke. A little time is required\r\nfor the mixture to burn; there is a brief interval between the instant\r\nwhen it is set on fire and the instant when it is all in flame. Thus it\r\nis clear that if the mixture is all to be burning as the piston starts\r\nthe power stroke, it must be set on fire before that time, or, in\r\nother words, toward the end of the compression stroke.\r\n\r\nThe point at which ignition should occur depends on the speed of the\r\nengine and should change when the speed changes. The time required\r\nfor the flame to spread throughout the mixture does not change; let\r\nus say that, with the engine running at 1200 revolutions a minute,\r\nthe mixture can be ignited when the piston is ¼ inch from the end\r\nof the compression stroke, and will all be in flame by the time the\r\npiston starts on the power stroke. If the engine is slowed down to\r\n600 revolutions a minute and no change is made in the ignition, the\r\nmixture will all be in flame before the piston reaches the end of the\r\ncompression stroke; pressure will then be produced before the piston\r\nis in position to perform the power stroke. The pressure will try to\r\nmake the engine run backwards; it will sometimes be sufficient to make\r\nthe engine stop. If the momentum of the flywheel is sufficient to\r\nforce the piston to the end of the stroke against the pressure, this\r\ncondition will cause a loss of power. This is called _preignition_, or\r\nignition that occurs too soon. One effect of it is to produce a hard,\r\nmetallic knocking, due to the oil being squeezed out of the bearings by\r\nthe great pressure, which permits the bearing and shaft to strike. The\r\nremedy is to make ignition occur later in the stroke.\r\n\r\nIf the engine is speeded up above 1200 revolutions, the piston will\r\nhave had time to move some distance on the power stroke before the\r\nmixture is all in flame; the combustion space will then be too large to\r\npermit the mixture to produce its greatest pressure, and again there\r\nwill be a loss of power. The remedy in this case is to make ignition\r\noccur earlier in the compression stroke.\r\n\r\nWhen ignition is made to occur early in the compression stroke, it is\r\nsaid to be _advanced_; when it is made to occur late in the stroke, it\r\nis said to be _retarded_.\r\n\r\nTo get the best results, the engine should be run with ignition\r\nadvanced as far as is possible without causing knocking.\r\n\r\nThe charge of mixture is always set on fire by an electric spark, and\r\nthe parts that produce and control this spark are called the _ignition\r\nsystem_.\r\n\r\nAn ignition system consists of: First, the apparatus that produces the\r\nelectric current, which is usually a _magneto_; second, a _timer_,\r\nwhich controls the instant at which the spark occurs; third, the _spark\r\nplugs_, which project into the cylinders, and at which the sparks take\r\nplace; fourth, a _switch_, by which the sparking current can be turned\r\non or off, and fifth, the wires, or _cables_, by which the parts are\r\nconnected.\r\n\r\nThe electric current that gives the spark is always produced by\r\nmagnetism. In a magneto, magnetism is obtained from the heavy steel\r\nmagnets that are part of it; there is a constant flow of magnetism from\r\none end of these to the other. To obtain an electric current, a coil\r\nof wire is placed in the magnetism, and the strength of the magnetism\r\nis made to change; it alternately becomes weak and strong. Whenever a\r\nchange in strength takes place, an electric current flows in the wire,\r\nand it continues to flow as long as the magnetism continues to change\r\nin strength. When the change in strength is very great, that is, when\r\nthe magnetism changes from very weak to very strong, or from very\r\nstrong to very weak, the electric current is more powerful than when\r\nthere is only a little change in strength. A more powerful current is\r\nalso produced by a change that takes place suddenly than by a change\r\nthat takes place slowly.\r\n\r\nThe electrical principle that produces a current in this manner is\r\ncalled _induction_; the current produced is known as an _induced_\r\ncurrent.\r\n\r\nA magneto has two or more magnets, and between their ends, or _poles_,\r\nthere revolves a piece of iron called the _armature_. A piece of iron\r\nplaced between the poles of a magnet becomes a magnet itself; the\r\narmature is so shaped that, as it revolves, its magnetism continually\r\nchanges in strength, and it is the changes in the strength of the\r\nmagnetism of the armature that produce the sparking current.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 42.—ARMATURE]\r\n\r\nThe iron armature of the Bosch magneto, which is the best known type,\r\nis shown in Figure 42. It has a central bar with two heads, the wire\r\nbeing wound around the central bar, or _core_. The shafts on which it\r\nrevolves are attached to the ends of the heads.\r\n\r\nFigure 43 shows different positions of the armature between the poles\r\nof the magnet, and illustrates the changes in the magnetism of the\r\ncentral bar. There is a continual flow of magnetism from one pole of a\r\nmagnet to the other; if a piece of iron lies between them the magnetism\r\nwill use it as a bridge, but often its easiest path will be through the\r\nair. In A, Figure 43, the armature lies crossways, and its central bar\r\nor core forms a perfect bridge for the magnetism. Practically all of\r\nthe magnetism flows through it, and it then becomes a powerful magnet\r\nitself. It sets up its own flow of magnetism, which flows through the\r\ncore to one head, through the air to the other head, and so back to the\r\ncore.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 43.—FLOW OF MAGNETISM THROUGH ARMATURE CORE]\r\n\r\nIn B, the armature has revolved a little. Most of the magnetism is\r\nstill flowing through the core, but some of it is finding an easier\r\npath by flowing through the heads and across the air space to the other\r\npole. The magnetism of the core is, therefore, a little weaker than it\r\nis in A.\r\n\r\nIn C, the heads alone form bridges between the poles, and none of the\r\nmagnetism flows by the core because that no longer forms a path. The\r\ncore is no longer producing magnetism; in moving from A to C there has\r\nthus been a complete change in the strength of the magnetism of the\r\ncore, for from full strength it has died away to nothing.\r\n\r\nBy a further movement, as in D, the core again acts as a bridge, and\r\nanother change in strength occurs, this time from nothing to full\r\nstrength again. In moving from D to B, there are slight changes in\r\nstrength, but not enough to produce a sparking current; it is only in\r\npassing from B to D that a sparking current can be produced.\r\n\r\nIn this type of magneto the space between the heads is wound full of\r\nwire, which of course revolves with the armature; the more turns of\r\nwire there are, the more intense will be the current, so very fine wire\r\nis used to get the greatest possible number of turns.\r\n\r\nIn the Bosch magneto the first few layers are of coarse wire, and are\r\nthe _primary winding_. The remainder, called the _secondary winding_,\r\nis very fine wire, and the two are connected so that one forms an\r\nextension of the other.\r\n\r\nIt has been explained that it is most important to have the spark occur\r\nat exactly the right instant in the stroke. On a magneto the instant of\r\nsparking is controlled by a _timer_, or _circuit breaker_, which is a\r\nswitch that is automatically operated at the time when the magneto is\r\nproducing a current sufficiently intense to form a spark.\r\n\r\nFigure 44 illustrates one complete revolution of the armature, and\r\nit will be seen that it passes twice from position B to position\r\nD. This shows that it gives a sparking current twice during each\r\nrevolution. The circuit breaker must therefore operate twice during\r\neach revolution. It is placed at the end of the magneto; in some makes\r\nit revolves with the armature and is operated by stationary cams, while\r\nin others it is stationary, and is operated by a cam on the armature\r\nshaft. In either case the effect is the same.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 44.—ONE COMPLETE REVOLUTION OF THE ARMATURE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 45.—CONNECTIONS OF BOSCH MAGNETO]\r\n\r\nFigure 45 shows the way in which the winding on the armature of a Bosch\r\nmagneto is connected with the circuit breaker and with the armature.\r\nThe circuit breaker shown is not the kind used on the Bosch, and serves\r\nonly to illustrate the principle. It consists of a lever pivoted at one\r\nend, with the other end resting against the tip of a screw. A cam bears\r\nagainst the lever and can move it to break the contact with the screw.\r\nThe cam is so set that it moves the lever at the time when the current\r\nis most intense.\r\n\r\nThe coarse wire, or primary winding, on the armature is connected with\r\nthe lever and with the screw of the circuit breaker; when the lever is\r\ntouching the screw, any current produced in the primary winding has a\r\ncomplete path, or _circuit_, in which to flow.\r\n\r\nThe fine wire, or secondary winding, is wound on top of the primary,\r\nand its inmost end is connected to the outmost end of the primary\r\nso that one forms a continuation of the other. The outmost end of\r\nthe secondary leads to the spark plug; any current produced in the\r\nsecondary winding flows to the spark plug, and, if intense enough,\r\nwill jump across the small gap in the plug, and return to the\r\nsecondary by way of the primary.\r\n\r\nReferring to Figure 43, a weak current is produced in the primary while\r\nthe armature revolves from D to B; at that time the circuit breaker is\r\nclosed, so the current can flow in the path thus provided for it. A\r\ncurrent also tries to flow in the secondary, but is too weak to jump\r\nacross the gap in the spark plug. As the armature comes closer to the\r\npoint C, Figure 43, the primary current becomes more intense, and the\r\nelectricity in the secondary increases its endeavor to jump the gap in\r\nthe spark plug, but is still unable to do so.\r\n\r\nAs the armature passes over the point C, the circuit breaker opens.\r\nThe primary current, which is then most intense, finds its path taken\r\naway from it, and it seeks another, which it finds by flowing into the\r\nsecondary winding. This flow of primary current, added to the pressure\r\nalready existing in the secondary, forms a current sufficiently\r\nintense to jump across the gap in the spark plug, and in so jumping it\r\nproduces the ignition spark.\r\n\r\nAs the armature passes to position D, Figure 43, the circuit breaker\r\ncloses, and the action is repeated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 46.—“K-W” INDUCTOR]\r\n\r\nA magneto of this type is thus seen to give two sparks to every\r\nrevolution of the armature.\r\n\r\nK-W and Dixie magnetos operate on the same general principle as the\r\nBosch, with the difference that the wire windings are separate from\r\nthe armature, and do not revolve. The revolving part, which is called\r\nan _inductor_, consists of blocks of iron, so shaped that, as they\r\nrevolve, they alternately lead the magnetism to the core of the winding\r\nand then away from it. The result is that the core gains magnetism and\r\nthen loses it, and these continual changes in strength produce sparking\r\ncurrents in the winding.\r\n\r\nThe inductor of a K-W magneto is shown in Figure 46. It consists of\r\na shaft on which are mounted two blocks of iron at right angles. The\r\nsection of shaft that joins them is the core of the winding; the wire\r\nis wound on it just as thread is wound on a spool, but with a space\r\nbetween, so that the shaft may revolve inside of the coil.\r\n\r\nFigure 47 shows the inductor in three positions of its revolution\r\nbetween the poles of the magnet. When it is in the first position,\r\nmagnetism can flow from one pole of the magnet to the other by going\r\ninto one end, A, of one block, through the core, and out of one end,\r\nC, of the other block. This makes a magnet of the core and it forms\r\nmagnetism of its own. When the inductor turns to the second position\r\nmagnetism can get across without flowing through the core, for the\r\nblocks now give it a path. As the flow through the core ceases, the\r\ncore’s magnetism dies away, which gives the change in strength that is\r\nneeded to produce a sparking current.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 47.—“K-W” INDUCTOR IN THREE POSITIONS]\r\n\r\nWhen the inductor is in the third position, the core again becomes the\r\npath for the magnetism and is magnetized; these changes continue as\r\nlong as the inductor turns.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 48.—“DIXIE” INDUCTOR]\r\n\r\nWhile an armature type of magneto, like the Bosch, produces two sparks\r\nto every revolution, the K-W produces four, for there are four periods\r\nduring every revolution when there is sufficient change in the strength\r\nof the magnetism of the core to produce a sparking current.\r\n\r\nIn these magnetos the revolving shaft is parallel to the ends of the\r\nmagnets, but in the Dixie magneto it is at a right angle, as shown\r\nin Figure 48. The shaft is of some metal, such as brass or bronze,\r\nthrough which magnetism will not flow; otherwise the shaft would form a\r\ncontinuous path. The inductor blocks are mounted on the shaft, and act\r\nas extensions of the poles of the magnet. The core on which the wire is\r\nwound is a separate piece, placed under the arch of the magnets, with\r\nends that extend down and form a tunnel in which the inductor revolves.\r\n\r\nFigure 49 shows an end view of the inductor, the magnets being cut\r\naway so that the core may be seen. As inductor block A is an extension\r\nof one pole of the magnet, magnetism tries to flow from it to block\r\nB, which is an extension of the other pole of the magnet. When the\r\ninductor is in position 1, Figure 49, magnetism can flow from block\r\nA through the core to block B, the core then being magnetized. In\r\nposition 2, magnetism can flow from one block to the other by going\r\nthrough the ends of the core instead of through the core itself; the\r\ncore then loses its magnetism, but regains it when the inductor moves\r\nto position 3.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 49.—THREE POSITIONS OF “DIXIE” INDUCTOR]\r\n\r\nIn practically all makes of magnetos the circuit breaker is at the\r\nend of the armature or inductor shaft, and is operated by it. The\r\nBosch circuit breaker is illustrated in Figure 50, the parts being\r\nmounted on a plate attached to the shaft and revolving with it. The\r\nlever is L-shaped, pivoted at the angle, with one end resting on the\r\ntip of a screw. When the shaft revolves, the other end of the lever is\r\ndragged over a block of metal that acts as a cam; this makes it move\r\non its pivot and separates it from the screw. By turning the screw the\r\ndistance of separation may be adjusted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 50.—“BOSCH” CIRCUIT BREAKER]\r\n\r\nIn the circuit breaker of the K-W magneto it is the cam that revolves,\r\nwhile the lever is stationary, as shown in Figure 51. It will be\r\nnoticed that the cam will move the lever only twice during each\r\nrevolution; the magneto can produce four sparks during a revolution,\r\nbut with this arrangement of the cam only two of them are used.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 51.—“K-W” CIRCUIT BREAKER]\r\n\r\nIt has been said that an intense sparking current is produced when\r\nthere is a great change in the strength of the magnetism, and when the\r\nchange in strength occurs suddenly. There cannot be any alteration in\r\nthe change in strength, for the greatest magnetic strength of the core\r\nis what is given it by the magnet, and changing from this to nothing\r\nis the greatest change possible. The suddenness with which the change\r\ntakes place, however, depends on the speed at which the magneto runs. A\r\n4-cylinder engine requires two sparks to each revolution of the crank\r\nshaft; the armature of a Bosch magneto for this engine will therefore\r\nrun at the same speed as the crank shaft.\r\n\r\nThe K-W magneto, giving four sparks to the revolution, could run at\r\nhalf of the speed of the crank shaft, but then the change in the\r\nstrength of the magnetism would take place slowly, and the sparking\r\ncurrent would not be sufficiently intense. By using only two of the\r\nsparks the magneto is run at the same speed as the crank shaft; the\r\nchange in strength then takes place more suddenly, and a more intense\r\nsparking current is produced.\r\n\r\nThe circuit breaker of a magneto for a 1-cylinder engine has only one\r\ncam, so that a single spark is produced during each revolution of the\r\narmature; the armature makes one revolution to every two revolutions of\r\nthe crank shaft.\r\n\r\nHowever many cylinders an engine may have, the magneto must be revolved\r\nfrom one point of sparking to the next in the interval between ignition\r\nin one cylinder and ignition in the next cylinder to fire. A magneto\r\nis driven by the crank shaft through gears or by a chain, which are so\r\nproportioned and set that the magneto is at a point of sparking at the\r\ninstant when a piston is in position for ignition.\r\n\r\nA magneto for an engine with more than one cylinder is provided with\r\na _distributor_, which passes the sparking current to the particular\r\ncylinder that is ready for ignition. A distributor is a revolving\r\nswitch built into the magneto, with as many _points_, or _contacts_, as\r\nthe engine has cylinders. At the instant when the magneto produces a\r\nsparking current, the revolving distributor arm is in position to pass\r\nthe current to one of the contacts, and the current flows to the spark\r\nplug with which it is connected.\r\n\r\nAn electric current must have a complete path, or circuit, in order\r\nto be able to flow. In a magneto ignition system this path is partly\r\nof wire and partly of the metal of the engine. The diagram in Figure\r\n45 indicates that the current returns to the magneto from the circuit\r\nbreaker lever and the spark plug by wire, but in actual construction it\r\nreturns by the metal of the engine. This is called a _ground return_;\r\nthe circuit is said to be _grounded_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 52.—“BOSCH” MAGNETO IN SECTION]\r\n\r\nFigure 52 is a side view of a Bosch magneto, partly broken away to\r\nshow the interior. As can be seen, one end of the primary winding is\r\nscrewed to the armature, and is thereby connected with the metal of the\r\nmagneto; as the magneto is attached to the engine the primary winding\r\nis thus in contact with that also. The other end of the primary winding\r\nleads to the insulated block of the circuit breaker, Figure 50. This\r\nblock is _insulated_ from the disk; that is, while it is attached to\r\nthe disk, it is kept from touching it by means of pieces of hard rubber\r\nor mica. Through these an electric current cannot pass.\r\n\r\nThe lever is grounded; that is, it is in contact with the metal of\r\nthe magneto. When the lever touches the screw of the insulated block,\r\ncurrent can flow; when they are separated, the circuit is broken.\r\n\r\nOne end of the secondary winding, Figure 52, is attached to the outer\r\nend of the primary. The other end leads to the _slip ring_, which is a\r\nmetal rim on a hard rubber wheel attached to the armature and revolving\r\nwith it. Sparking current flowing to the slip ring is led off by a\r\ncarbon brush and passed to the distributor.\r\n\r\nShould a spark plug wire fall off while the engine is running, the\r\ncurrent would lose its path and would seek another; it is quite\r\npowerful enough to make a path for itself by breaking through the\r\nwindings. As this would injure the magneto, such a thing is prevented\r\nby providing a _safety spark gap_, which acts like a safety valve in\r\ngiving the current a path when the regular path is interrupted. It\r\nconsists of two points of metal, one attached to the metal of the\r\nmagneto and the other connected with the slip ring brush; it is a more\r\ndifficult path than the one through the spark plug, but easier than\r\nbreaking down the windings.\r\n\r\nFigure 53 is a section of the K-W magneto. As the coil does not\r\nrevolve, no slip ring is necessary; the sparking current flows directly\r\nto the distributor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 53.—“K-W” MAGNETO IN SECTION]\r\n\r\nTo start an engine, the crank shaft must be turned at sufficient\r\nspeed to drive the magneto fast enough to produce a spark. With large\r\nengines this is often a difficult matter, so it is very usual to equip\r\na magneto with an _impulse starter_. One part of this is attached to\r\nthe magneto shaft and the other to the engine shaft that drives the\r\nmagneto; the two are connected by a spring. When starting, a catch\r\nholds the armature and prevents it from turning. The drive shaft\r\nturns, however, and in so doing winds up the spring. At a certain\r\npoint the catch is automatically released, and the spring then throws\r\nthe armature over at a speed that gives a good spark. A spark is thus\r\nassured, even though the engine is being cranked very slowly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nBATTERY IGNITION SYSTEMS\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the greater number of tractor engines use magneto ignition, many\r\nuse battery and coil systems, which are the same in general principle\r\nas magneto systems, but produce magnetism in a different manner.\r\n\r\nCopper is a _nonmagnetic_ metal; that is, magnetism will not flow\r\nthrough it, nor can it be magnetized. If a pile of iron filings is\r\nstirred with a copper wire there will be no effect, as might be\r\nexpected; but if a current of electricity flows through the wire, the\r\niron filings will cling to it, as shown in Figure 54, as if it were a\r\nreal magnet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 54.—MAGNETISM IN A COPPER WIRE]\r\n\r\nIt is one of the principles of electricity that when a current flows\r\nthrough a wire, the wire is surrounded by magnetism, which continues as\r\nlong as the current flows; when the circuit is broken and the current\r\nstops flowing, the magnetism dies away. The magnetism produced is\r\nfeeble and can be very greatly increased by winding the wire around an\r\niron bar. The magnetism produced by the current then flows into the\r\nbar, and that, like the core of the winding of a magneto, throws out\r\nmagnetism of its own. This is indicated in Figure 55. By changing the\r\nintensity of the electric current, or by cutting it off, the strength\r\nof the magnetism can be made to change, and this change of strength can\r\nproduce a sparking current.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 55.—MAGNETISM FROM ELECTRICITY]\r\n\r\nThe principle employed is illustrated in Figure 56. A is a coil of\r\nwire wound around one end of an iron bar and connected with a battery;\r\nB is an entirely separate coil of wire wound around the other end of\r\nthe bar, with its ends separated by a short distance. By closing the\r\nbattery switch the current will be permitted to flow in coil A, and\r\nthe bar will become magnetized; the magnetism that it throws out will\r\nbe felt by coil B. When the switch is opened the current stops flowing\r\nand the magnetism dies out of the bar; these changes in strength will\r\ncreate an electric current in coil B, which will form a spark as it\r\npasses across the space between the ends.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 56.—PRINCIPLE OF SPARK COIL]\r\n\r\nIn ignition coils, coil B is wound on top of coil A. Coil A, called the\r\n_primary winding_, consists of a few layers of coarse wire. The more\r\nturns of wire there are in coil B, called the _secondary winding_, the\r\nmore intense will be the current that it produces, and the intensity\r\nis also increased by keeping the windings close to the iron core. The\r\nsecondary winding is, therefore, made of exceedingly fine wire, and has\r\na very great number of turns.\r\n\r\nTo obtain a spark, a current is permitted to flow through the primary\r\nwinding to create magnetism, and the flow is then stopped to cause\r\nthe magnetism to die away. The secondary winding is affected by each\r\nof these changes in magnetic strength. The bar loses magnetism more\r\nrapidly than it gains it, however; it is therefore the dying out of the\r\nmagnetism that has the greater effect on the secondary winding, and\r\nthat causes it to produce a sparking current.\r\n\r\nTo use this principle for ignition, the engine is fitted with a\r\nrevolving switch, which closes the circuit as a piston is on the\r\ncompression stroke, and then breaks the circuit at the instant when\r\na spark is desired. Combined with the revolving switch, or _timer_,\r\nis a distributor like the distributor of a magneto, which passes the\r\nsparking current to the cylinder that is ready to receive it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 57.—“ATWATER-KENT” IGNITION SYSTEM]\r\n\r\nTo produce an intense sparking current, it is necessary to break the\r\ncircuit as abruptly as possible, in order to cause the magnetism to die\r\naway suddenly. Figure 57 shows how this is done in the Atwater-Kent\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nThe parts of the circuit breaker are carried on a plate, in the center\r\nof which revolves a shaft with a notch in it. Against the side of this\r\nshaft rests the hooked end of the sliding catch; as the notch comes\r\nunder this hooked end, the sliding catch is drawn forward, only to be\r\nsnapped back by its spring as the notch moves from under it. The lifter\r\nis a bit of metal, pivoted at one end, with its free end lying between\r\nthe sliding catch and the flat steel spring that carries one of the\r\ncontact points.\r\n\r\nA, Figure 57, is a diagram of the system. B shows the position of the\r\nparts as the notch carries the sliding catch forward, and C shows their\r\npositions as the spring snaps the sliding catch back to its place. It\r\nwill be seen that in thus moving back it strikes the lifter, which\r\nin turn moves the contact spring, and so closes the circuit; but the\r\ncircuit is instantly broken as the parts spring back to position. The\r\nmovement of the parts is so rapid that to the eye they seem to be\r\nstanding still. The circuit is closed only for an instant, but that\r\nis sufficient to magnetize and demagnetize the coil, and to produce a\r\nsparking current.\r\n\r\nThe operation of this system depends on the very great swiftness with\r\nwhich the circuit is made and broken; there is not sufficient time\r\nfor the core to get thoroughly magnetized, but such magnetism as is\r\nproduced changes strength so quickly that it gives a sufficiently\r\nintense current to create an ignition spark.\r\n\r\nIn other battery systems of like principle, the circuit is closed for\r\na long enough time to allow the core to become fully magnetized, the\r\ncircuit then being suddenly broken. In some of these systems the timer\r\nbreaks the circuit, while in others it is broken by the magnetism,\r\nthrough a _vibrator_.\r\n\r\nA _vibrator coil_ system is illustrated in Figure 58. The timer is a\r\nring made of some kind of insulating material, with a plate of metal\r\nset in it and forming one of the timer contacts. The other contact is\r\nthe revolving brush, driven by the engine; the circuit is closed when\r\nthe brush touches the metal plate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 58.—VIBRATOR COIL IGNITION SYSTEM]\r\n\r\nOpposite the end of the core is a flat steel spring, or _vibrator\r\nblade_, resting against the tip of a screw; when the core is magnetized\r\nit draws the end of the blade to it, and separates it from the screw.\r\nThe battery current flows from the timer contact to the screw, then to\r\nthe vibrator blade and to the primary winding of the coil. The core\r\nthen becomes magnetized, and draws the blade away from the screw,\r\nwhich breaks the circuit; this causes the magnetism to die away, and\r\na sparking current is produced in the secondary winding of the coil.\r\nThe vibrator blade, no longer held down by the magnetism, springs\r\nback against the screw; the circuit is again made, and the action is\r\nrepeated. The movement of the vibrator blade is very rapid, being some\r\nhundreds of vibrations a second.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 59.—SPARK PLUG]\r\n\r\nA spark plug is illustrated in Figure 59. It consists of a metal shell\r\nscrewed into the cylinder, enclosing an _insulator_ of porcelain, mica,\r\nor some similar material. Through the insulator passes the center\r\nelectrode, which is a rod of metal, with its lower end separated by a\r\nshort distance from the shell or from a wire attached to the shell.\r\nThis separation is the gap across which the sparking current passes,\r\nand at which the spark occurs.\r\n\r\nSpark plugs receive the pressure of the power stroke, and must be\r\nstrongly made in order to withstand it. A leaky spark plug will cut\r\ndown the power of the engine, just as a leaky valve will.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTRANSMISSION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe parts of a tractor by which the power of the engine is applied\r\nto the driving wheels are called the _transmission_, and include the\r\n_clutch_, _the change speed gear_, the _differential_ and the _drive_.\r\n\r\nIt has been shown that a gas engine delivers power only when it is\r\nrunning at speed; it cannot run until some outside power drives it\r\nthrough the inlet and compression strokes.\r\n\r\nThe tractor cannot move until the engine is running and delivering\r\npower, and it follows, therefore, that it must be possible to\r\ndisconnect the engine from the driving mechanism in order that it may\r\nrun independently. This is done by means of a _clutch_, which is a\r\ndevice that connects two shafts, or disconnects them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 60.—INTERNAL CLUTCH]\r\n\r\nA clutch must be so made that when it is engaged it takes hold, not\r\nsuddenly, but gradually. If it took hold suddenly, the tractor would be\r\nrequired to jump at once into full motion; this would cause a severe\r\nstraining of the parts and probable breakage. The alternative would be\r\nthe abrupt stopping of the engine, and this would also strain things.\r\n\r\nBy making the clutch in such a way that it slips, and takes hold little\r\nby little, the tractor starts slowly, and gradually comes up to speed;\r\nthe slipping of the clutch then ceases, and it takes hold firmly.\r\n\r\nAll clutches operate by the friction of one surface against another; in\r\nsome, the surfaces are curved and in others flat, while in still others\r\nthe clutch is a band around a wheel, or _drum_. A clutch is operated by\r\na hand lever or by a foot pedal.\r\n\r\nFigure 60 shows a type of clutch that operates inside a drum, which is\r\noften the overhanging rim of the flywheel. The shaft in the center is\r\nindependent of the flywheel, and it is the purpose of the clutch, which\r\nis attached to the shaft, to lock the shaft and flywheel together when\r\nthe tractor is to be started.\r\n\r\nThe brake shoes, which bear against the drum, form the ends of pivoted\r\nlevers, and are lined with an asbestos material that resists the heat\r\ncaused by the friction against the drum.\r\n\r\nA cone-shaped block of steel slides lengthways on the shaft; when it\r\nis pushed into position, it forces out the yokes, and thus presses the\r\nbrake shoes against the drum.\r\n\r\nA _plate clutch_, or _disk clutch_, is shown in Figure 61. The\r\nprinciple of a plate clutch may be illustrated by placing a half-dollar\r\nbetween two quarters and pinching them with the thumb and forefinger.\r\nIf they are held loosely, the half-dollar may be turned between the\r\nquarters, but if they are pinched tightly, the friction between the\r\ncoins will be so great that one cannot be turned without turning the\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 61.—PLATE CLUTCH]\r\n\r\nAttached to the flywheel are studs, which support a disk, or plate;\r\nthis plate revolves with the flywheel, and is practically a part of it.\r\nOn either side of this plate are other plates that are supported on the\r\ndrive shaft; they revolve with it, but can slide along it. The end of\r\nthe shaft is square and fits a square hole in a collar, so that while\r\nthe collar may slide along the shaft, the two must turn together. Cams\r\nare mounted on the hub of one of the plates in such a position that\r\nthey can press the outside plates together and pinch the flywheel plate\r\nbetween. The cams are operated by pressing the collar against them.\r\n\r\nThe first drawing shows the clutch out, or released; the flywheel may\r\nthen turn without turning the shaft, for the plates are not in contact.\r\nThe second drawing shows the clutch in, or engaged. The collar is\r\npressed against the cams, and the plates in turn are drawn together,\r\npinching the flywheel plate between them. The flywheel and the drive\r\nshaft then revolve together.\r\n\r\nPlate clutches are often made with more than three plates; some makes\r\nrun in a bath of oil, and some are intended to work dry.\r\n\r\nIn a cone clutch, the overhanging rim of the flywheel is funnel-shaped,\r\nand into it fits a cone-shaped disk carried on the end of the drive\r\nshaft. To engage the clutch, the disk is slid along the shaft against\r\nthe flywheel, the friction between the two being sufficient to drive\r\nthe shaft.\r\n\r\nWhen a clutch is thrown in it should take hold gradually, slipping at\r\nfirst, but finally having a firm grip. When it is thrown out, it should\r\nrelease instantly and completely.\r\n\r\nThe power delivered by an engine depends on the _bore_ and _stroke_\r\nof the cylinder, and on the speed. The greater the bore, or diameter\r\nof the cylinder, and the greater the stroke, or distance the piston\r\nmoves in a half-revolution of the crank shaft, the larger will be the\r\ncombustion space, and the larger will be the charge of mixture that\r\nit can take in; the larger the charge, the greater will be the power\r\nproduced when the charge burns.\r\n\r\nEach cylinder produces power once during every two revolutions of the\r\ncrank shaft; if the engine runs at 1,000 revolutions per minute there\r\nwill be twice as many power strokes as there would be if it ran at 500\r\nrevolutions per minute, and during that minute it will produce twice as\r\nmuch power.\r\n\r\nA traction engine is intended to run at a certain speed, at which it\r\nwill produce its greatest power without overstraining its parts. This\r\n_normal speed_ for any particular engine depends on the number of\r\ncylinders, their size and design, and other details established by the\r\nmanufacturer. To get the best from the engine, this is the speed at\r\nwhich it should always be run.\r\n\r\nThe power required to move the tractor depends on various things;\r\nthe hardness and smoothness of the ground, the grade, the load it is\r\npulling, and so on. The tractor might be running on level ground,\r\npulling so great a load that the engine is called on for all of the\r\npower that it can deliver.\r\n\r\nOn coming to a hill, still more power will be required, for now the\r\ntractor and its load must be lifted as well as moved forward. The\r\nengine, already working at its limit, cannot deliver the extra power\r\nneeded, and will slow down and stop unless something is done to aid\r\nit. In such a case, the change speed gear is used to give the engine\r\na greater leverage on its work, just as a block and tackle gives a\r\ngreater leverage or purchase to a man who must lift a heavy weight.\r\n\r\nLet us say that the normal speed of the engine is 1,000 revolutions per\r\nminute, and that it is so connected that it makes 40 revolutions while\r\nthe driving wheels make 1, the speed of the tractor being 3 miles per\r\nhour. If it is a 4-cylinder engine there will thus be 80 power strokes\r\nto every revolution of the driving wheels. The engine is delivering its\r\nfull power and cannot do more should the tractor be called on for an\r\nextra exertion, such as climbing a hill or crossing rough ground.\r\n\r\nBy changing the connections between the engine and the driving wheels,\r\nthe engine can be made to run twice as many revolutions to one turn of\r\nthe driving wheels, which will give double the number of power strokes;\r\nthe wheels will thus be turned with twice the force. As no change is\r\nmade in the speed of the engine, the wheels will now turn at half their\r\nformer speed, and the tractor will run at 1½ miles per hour. It will,\r\nhowever, have twice the ability to overcome obstacles.\r\n\r\nThis change in the connections between the engine and the drive is\r\nperformed by the _change speed gear_, which is driven by the engine and\r\nwhich in turn drives the wheels.\r\n\r\nThere are many varieties of change speed gears, but the main principle\r\nin them all is the same, for they depend on the action of cog-wheels,\r\nor _gears_.\r\n\r\nWhen two gears running together, or _in mesh_, have the same number of\r\nteeth, they will revolve at the same speed. If one has half as many\r\nteeth as the other—10 teeth and 20, let us say—the 10-tooth gear will\r\nmake two revolutions while the 20-tooth gear is making one.\r\n\r\nThere are two shafts in a change speed gear, one driven by the engine\r\nand the other driving the wheels; each carries gears that mesh with\r\ngears on the other shaft. These pairs of gears are of different sizes,\r\nand any pair may be used; the shaft driven by the engine runs as the\r\nengine runs, while the speed of the other shaft depends on the pair of\r\ngears that is being used.\r\n\r\nBy changing from one pair of gears to another, the driven shaft, and,\r\nconsequently, the wheels, may be run at a greater or less number of\r\nrevolutions, while the speed of the engine and the driving shaft do not\r\nchange. The number of power strokes that occur during one revolution of\r\nthe wheels is thus changed, and they turn with more force or with less.\r\n\r\n_High speed_, or _high gear_, means the combination of gears that\r\ngives the greatest speed to the wheels, but the fewest power strokes\r\nto each revolution. The combination that gives the slowest speed to\r\nthe wheels, but the greatest number of power strokes, is called _low\r\nspeed_, or _low gear_.\r\n\r\nMany tractors have but two speeds, a low and a high; but others have an\r\nintermediate combination for conditions too severe for running on high\r\ngear but too easy for low.\r\n\r\nThe change speed gear mechanism also provides for reversing or backing\r\nthe tractor. Two gears running together turn in opposite directions,\r\nwhile in a train of three gears the outside gears turn in the same\r\ndirection. The usual combination in a change speed gear uses two gears\r\nfor going ahead; to run the driven shaft the other way, which will make\r\nthe tractor back, a third gear is meshed between the two.\r\n\r\nThe differences between various makes of change speed gears are in the\r\nmethods used to put into action the desired pair of gears.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 62.—PRINCIPLE OF SLIDING GEAR]\r\n\r\nTwo general plans are used. In one of them, a gear of each pair can\r\nslide endways on its shaft, but must revolve with it; thus it can be\r\nslid into mesh or out. In the other, the gears of a pair are always in\r\nmesh, but one of them is loose on its shaft, so that shaft and gear can\r\nrevolve independently. To make the pair of gears operate, the loose\r\ngear is locked to its shaft.\r\n\r\nFigure 62 shows the principle of the _sliding gear_ type. One part of\r\nthe shaft driven by the engine is square, and fits into square holes\r\nin its gears, which may thus slide along it, but must revolve with it.\r\nEach sliding gear is moved by a shifter block, which is operated by\r\na shift lever. There is a shifter block for each gear, and the shift\r\nlever may be moved sideways to operate either one of them.\r\n\r\nFigure 63 shows the _jaw clutch_ type of change speed gear, in which\r\nthe gears are in mesh all of the time, but run loose on their shaft\r\nwhen they are not working. The drawing shows _bevel gears_, which are\r\nused when the driving and driven shafts are at a right angle. The same\r\nprinciple is used for _spur gears_ on shafts that are parallel, as in\r\nFigure 62.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 63.—PRINCIPLE OF JAW CLUTCH CHANGE SPEED GEAR]\r\n\r\nThe center of the shaft is square, and fits a block that can slide\r\nendways, but that must revolve with it. The ends of the block have\r\nheavy teeth that can mesh with teeth on the hubs of the loose gears;\r\nmeshing the block with one of the gears forces that gear to revolve\r\nwith the shaft.\r\n\r\nThe drawing shows only one speed forward; the reverse is obtained by a\r\nsecond gear on the same shaft, which is placed on the opposite side of\r\nthe center of the driven gear, and turns it in the opposite direction.\r\n\r\nWhen a tractor turns, the outside wheel makes a larger circle than the\r\ninside wheel, and has a longer path to travel. Both wheels travel their\r\npaths in the same time, so it follows that the outside wheel must move\r\nfaster than the inside wheel, although both are being driven by the\r\nengine. This is allowed for by the _differential_, which is driven by\r\nthe change speed gear, and which in turn drives the wheels; it operates\r\nautomatically by the difference in the resistance to the rolling of the\r\nwheels.\r\n\r\nThe action of the differential is illustrated by an experiment that\r\nrequires a pair of wheels on an axle, like buggy wheels, and a stick\r\nlong enough to reach from one to the other. With the wheels on smooth\r\nground, put the ends of the stick through the wheels at the top, each\r\nend pressing against a spoke. Hold the stick at its center and push it\r\nforward; the stick will transmit the pressure to the spokes, and the\r\nwheels will turn. The wheels being on smooth ground, there is equal\r\nresistance to their movement, and they will run straight forward.\r\n\r\nNow repeat the experiment with the wheels so placed that one is on\r\na smooth roadway and the other on sand; as the wheel on the smooth\r\nsurface meets with less resistance than the other does, it moves\r\nfaster, and the pair of wheels circles, although the stick applies\r\nequal pressure to both.\r\n\r\nThe power developed by the engine is transmitted by the differential\r\nto both rear wheels; when the wheels meet with equal resistance, they\r\nturn equally, but when one wheel meets with greater resistance than the\r\nother, it slows down, while the other speeds up to correspond.\r\n\r\nA tractor with two driving wheels must use a differential in order to\r\nmake turns easily. Without a differential, the wheels would run always\r\nat equal speed, and in making a turn one would be obliged to slip.\r\n\r\nThe use of a differential has a disadvantage, however. If one wheel\r\nis in a mudhole and the other is on hard ground, the wheel in the mud\r\nmeets with little resistance, and all of the power of the engine goes\r\nto it; it spins without moving the tractor, while the other wheel\r\nremains stationary. In such a case all of the power should be applied\r\nto the wheel that has traction in order to move the tractor, but this\r\nthe differential fails to allow.\r\n\r\nIn some tractors the differential is so made that the parts may be\r\nlocked together. This lock is used when one wheel is in a mud hole, and\r\nas by its use power is transmitted equally to both wheels, the tractor\r\nmoves.\r\n\r\nGreat care must be taken to unlock the differential as soon as the need\r\nfor the lock has passed, for otherwise the wheels would slip on a turn,\r\nand the parts of the transmission might be strained or broken.\r\n\r\nA differential is usually made with two bevel gears placed face to\r\nface; between them is a frame holding three or more small bevel gears\r\nthat are in mesh with them both. The engine revolves the frame with its\r\nsmall gears; each of the large bevel gears revolves a driving wheel.\r\n\r\nWhen the tractor moves straight ahead the differential turns as if it\r\nwere one solid piece. When there is less resistance to one driving\r\nwheel than to the other, the small bevel gears, in addition to\r\nrevolving with the frame that carries them, turn on their shafts. This\r\ntransmits the power of the engine to one wheel more than the other,\r\naccording to the resistance of the wheels.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 64.—“I. H. C.” CHAIN DRIVE, SHOWING THE\r\nDIFFERENTIAL]\r\n\r\nFigure 64 shows one of the large bevel gears of a differential, with\r\nthe three small gears, the other large bevel gear being removed. A\r\ndifferential in section is shown in Figure 65.\r\n\r\nA tractor with only one driving wheel has no differential. Such\r\ntractors usually have two wheels, but one of them runs loose on\r\nthe axle, and serves only to support the tractor. The rear axle\r\nconstruction of a tractor with a 1-wheel drive is shown in Figure 66,\r\nwhich should be compared with the 2-wheel rear construction shown in\r\nFigure 65.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 65.—“CASE” REAR AXLE]\r\n\r\nThere are a number of methods used for transmitting power to the\r\ndriving wheels. In Figure 64 a chain is used; there are tractors with\r\nbut one chain, and others with a chain for each driving wheel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 66.—“OIL-PULL” REAR AXLE]\r\n\r\nThe most usual method is by a _master gear_, or _bull gear_, which is a\r\nlarge and heavy gear attached to the driving wheel, as shown in Figures\r\n65 and 66. In some tractors this gear is nearly the size of the wheel,\r\nand is fully exposed; in others it is smaller, and enclosed in an\r\noil-tight housing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 67.—DRIVING WORM]\r\n\r\nThe small gears that drive the bull gears are on the ends of the cross\r\nshaft, called the _jack shaft_, that carries the differential.\r\n\r\nIn the Fordson tractor the differential is built into the axle, as it\r\nis in an automobile, and power is applied by a _worm_. The worm is\r\ndriven by the change speed gear, and is a screw meshing with a gear on\r\nthe differential, whose teeth are cut at the proper angle to make them\r\nfit the threads of the worm. A worm, which is shown in Figure 67, is\r\nalways enclosed, and runs in oil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTRACTOR ARRANGEMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe uneven ground over which tractors must work requires the weight to\r\nbe kept low, to prevent capsizing, and they are also built wide, for\r\nthe narrower they are the more easily they tip over. They cannot be\r\nbroad in front, however, for if they are the steering wheels cannot\r\nbe swung enough to permit them to turn in the small circle that is\r\ndesirable.\r\n\r\nTo give a small turning circle some tractors are built with the front\r\nof the frame raised enough to permit the wheels to cut under. Others\r\nuse small steering wheels, but this is not desirable because small\r\nwheels will not run over rough ground as readily as large ones, and\r\nsteering is difficult.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 68.—TRACTOR ARRANGEMENT]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 69.—TRACTOR ARRANGEMENT]\r\n\r\nTypes of tractors are indicated in Figures 68 and 69. A has a\r\n4-cylinder vertical engine in front, driving both wheels by bull gears,\r\nwhile B is a 2-cylinder horizontal engine in the center, driving both\r\nwheels by chains. C has a 4-cylinder vertical engine set across the\r\nframe. These three types have riveted steel frames, to which the parts\r\nare attached.\r\n\r\nIn D, the drive is entirely enclosed within the rear axle housing,\r\nand the rear part of the frame is formed by the axle housing and the\r\nhousing of the change speed gear.\r\n\r\nE has a 1-cylinder horizontal engine with a single chain drive, while F\r\nhas a similar engine but drives to both wheels.\r\n\r\nG has no frame, its place being taken by the crank case of the engine\r\nand the housings of the parts of the transmission. G and H have\r\n4-cylinder vertical engines, G driving through an enclosed rear axle\r\nand H through bull gears.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 70.—“GRAY” TRACTOR]\r\n\r\nFigure 70 has one broad wheel instead of two narrower ones, this being\r\nplaced inside of the frame instead of outside. It has a 4-cylinder\r\nvertical engine placed across the frame, and drives through two chains.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 71.—TYPES OF FRONT AXLES]\r\n\r\nThe front axle of a tractor is almost always attached to the frame by\r\na pivot, so that the wheels will follow uneven ground. Some of the\r\nforms of front axles are shown in Figure 71.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 72.—SPRING SUPPORT]\r\n\r\nThe first is a plain bar, while the second is arched to raise the front\r\nof the frame in order to permit the steering wheels to cut under. In\r\nthe third the wheel axles are mounted on springs, which take up some of\r\nthe vibration and act as shock absorbers.\r\n\r\nThe fourth axle shown is built of steel bars riveted together to form\r\na truss, and the fifth is similar, with the frame pivot carried on\r\nsprings. The sketches at the bottom indicate the extent to which the\r\npivoted front axle may swing.\r\n\r\nFigure 72 shows a spring support for the axles, front and rear.\r\nThe axle bearing is in a block sliding in guides, the weight being\r\nsupported by a heavy spring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nLUBRICATION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most important thing in the care of a tractor is to oil it; every\r\nmoving part should be lubricated, and the greatest care should be taken\r\nto assure a never-failing supply of oil and grease.\r\n\r\nCarelessness in lubrication is the principal cause of tractor trouble.\r\nThere is nothing complicated or difficult about keeping a tractor\r\nproperly oiled; yet more tractors break down from careless lubrication\r\nthan from any other cause. Every tractor-maker issues an oiling diagram\r\nand oiling instructions, and there is no excuse for an operator whose\r\nmachine does not get the right kind of lubricant in the right quantity\r\nat each place where lubrication is necessary.\r\n\r\nThe cause of wear is friction; oil reduces friction and so reduces\r\nwear. No matter how smooth and highly polished two pieces of steel may\r\nbe, there will be friction between them if they are rubbed together,\r\nand they will wear each other. If they are oiled, the particles of oil\r\nwill keep the pieces from touching each other, and there will be no\r\nwear.\r\n\r\nOther substances than oil can be used; there are some kinds of\r\nmachinery that are lubricated with water, for instance. For general\r\nuse, however, oil and grease are the best, and are practically always\r\nused.\r\n\r\nThe object of a lubricant is to keep two pieces of metal from touching;\r\nit must therefore be able to get between them, and must stay there. If\r\nthe pieces are large and heavy, there will be much greater pressure\r\non the oil than if they are small and light, and the oil must be able\r\nto withstand this pressure and resist being squeezed out. The oil\r\nthat would keep the small, light pieces apart might not be able to\r\nstand the pressure of a greater weight, and might be squeezed out from\r\nbetween two heavy pieces.\r\n\r\nOil has a tendency to cling to whatever it touches, and thick oil\r\nor grease has more of this tendency than a thin, or “runny” oil. If\r\na thick oil or grease is used on light machinery, such as a sewing\r\nmachine, this clinging tendency would make the machine run hard, and\r\nmight even prevent its operation.\r\n\r\nWhen oil is heated, it becomes thinner, or more “runny.” Through\r\nthis, an oil used in a hot place might get so thin that it would not\r\nlubricate; and on the other hand, an oil that works all right in the\r\nheat of summer might get so thick on a cold winter day as to be useless.\r\n\r\nA slow-moving part of a machine uses a thick oil or a grease; a thin\r\noil must be used for a part that moves at high speed.\r\n\r\nSome of the parts of a tractor move slowly and some at high speed; some\r\nare cool and some are hot. Different kinds of lubricants are therefore\r\nrequired, and it is a grave mistake to use a lubricant that is not\r\nsuitable to the work that it is required to do.\r\n\r\nThe engine is the most difficult part of a tractor to lubricate, and\r\nthe part that suffers most if the supply fails or if the wrong kind\r\nof lubricant is used. In the first place, it is so hot that any oil\r\nwill burn, being turned to carbon; the best that can be expected of\r\nan oil is that it will resist burning until it has done its work of\r\nlubricating the piston and cylinder.\r\n\r\nA tractor engine is more difficult to oil than an automobile or\r\ntruck engine for the reason that it works harder and more steadily.\r\nAn automobile engine is rarely driven to the limit of its power; it\r\nhas frequent opportunities to cool when running down hill. A tractor\r\nengine, on the other hand, works at its full power all day long with\r\nno opportunities to cool off. An oil that gives good satisfaction on\r\nan automobile might ruin a tractor engine through its inability to\r\nwithstand the greater heat.\r\n\r\nThe makers of tractors understand the importance of using proper oils,\r\nand recommend certain brands and grades; these recommendations should\r\nbe followed in order to get the best possible results. All makers\r\nspecify at least two kinds of lubricants, and most of them three; one\r\nspecifies six, which range from a light sewing machine oil to a grease\r\nso thick that it is nearly solid. Whatever the recommendations may be,\r\nthey should be followed.\r\n\r\nIn general, lubricants are classified according to their thickness, and\r\nthey range from the light oil used for typewriters and sewing machines\r\nto grease so thick that it may be cut like butter. The thinnest oil\r\nis used for the circuit breaker pivot; this part is usually moved in\r\none direction by a cam and in the other by a light spring. A thick oil\r\nwould gum the bearing to such an extent that the spring might not be\r\nable to move the lever.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 73.—“MOGUL” OILING DIAGRAM]\r\n\r\n    ----+----------------------+----------------------------+-----------\r\n    KEY |      DESCRIPTION     |         QUANTITY           |LUBRICATION\r\n    ----+----------------------+----------------------------+-----------\r\n                           ONCE EVERY HOUR\r\n    ----+----------------------+----------------------------+-----------\r\n     L  | Rear axle bearing    | Two complete turns         | Cup Grease\r\n    ----+----------------------+----------------------------+-----------\r\n                         ONCE EVERY TWO HOURS\r\n    ----+----------------------+----------------------------+-----------\r\n     A  | Differential hub     | One complete turn          | Cup Grease\r\n     B  | Rear wheel hub       | One complete turn          | Cup Grease\r\n     C  | Differential pinion  | One complete turn          | Cup Grease\r\n     H  | Front wheel hub      | Two complete turns         | Cup Grease\r\n     T  | Governor and cam     | Two complete turns         | Cup Grease\r\n        |   shaft bearing      |                            |\r\n    ----+----------------------+----------------------------+-----------\r\n                          TWICE EVERY DAY\r\n    ----+----------------------+----------------------------+-----------\r\n     E  | Governor             | Oil                        | Cylinder\r\n        |                      |                            |        oil\r\n     F  | Outboard bearing     | Two complete turns when    | Cup Grease\r\n        |   grease cups        |           plowing          |\r\n     G  | Transmission         | One pint                   | See note\r\n        |                      |                            |      below\r\n        |{ Magneto trip        | Grease every 5 hours       | Cup Grease\r\n     N  |{ Magneto roller and  | Oil every 5 hours          | Oil\r\n        |{   slide             |                            |\r\n     J  | Steering worm        | Keep covered               | Cup Grease\r\n     W  | Steering hub grease  | One complete turn          | Cup Grease\r\n        |   cups               |                            |\r\n     V  | Steering worm shaft  | Oil every 5 hours          |\r\n     R  | Lubricator eccentric | Oil every 5 hours (keep    |\r\n        |                      |        wool in pocket)     |\r\n     P  | Cam roller slide     | Oil every 5 hours          |\r\n     K  | Valve levers         | Fill with oil every 5 hours|\r\n        |                      |  (keep wool in pockets)    |\r\n    ----+----------------------+----------------------------+-----------\r\n                    ONCE EVERY DAY TRACTOR IS IN USE\r\n    ----+----------------------+----------------------------+-----------\r\n     U  | Steering sector shaft| One complete turn          | Cup Grease\r\n    ----+----------------------+----------------------------+-----------\r\n     D  | MECHANICAL LUBRICATOR\r\n        |   Fill with a good grade of heavy gas engine cylinder oil.\r\n        |   Turn the crank on the mechanical oiler 40 to 50 times when\r\n        |   starting the engine.\r\n        | IMPORTANT\r\n        |   In cool or cold weather the oil in lubricator tank must be\r\n        |   warmed as it will not flow readily unless of the right\r\n        |   temperature.\r\n    ----+---------------------------------------------------------------\r\n     G  | TRANSMISSION\r\n        |   In warm weather, use heavy oil such as “600” transmission\r\n        |   or Polarine transmission oil; in cold weather, use a good\r\n        |   light oil.\r\n     S  | GOVERNOR\r\n        |   Cylinder oil in governor should cover shoe.\r\n     M  | MAGNETO\r\n        |   Oil magneto bearings once a week with sewing machine or\r\n        |   cream separator oil.\r\n    ----+---------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe oil used in an engine is thicker, and has a high _burning point_\r\nand high _viscosity_; that is, it should be able to resist burning, and\r\nshould not get so thin when it is heated that it will be squeezed out\r\nof the bearings. The same kind of oil that is used in the engine can be\r\nused in many other parts of the tractor.\r\n\r\nGrease is usually used for the gears of the transmission and drive.\r\nThere is very great pressure between the teeth of two meshing gears,\r\nand only thick oil and grease have sufficient viscosity to resist being\r\nsqueezed out.\r\n\r\nThe thickest grease is used on the tracks of caterpillar-type tractors.\r\n\r\nBefore operating a tractor, the lubrication chart supplied by the\r\nmanufacturer should be studied with great care, and all of its\r\nrequirements should be observed. This chart is usually in the form of\r\na diagram accompanied by a table, as shown in Figure 73, which is the\r\nlubrication chart of one of the International Harvester tractors. This\r\nfigure illustrates the constant attention that is demanded by this most\r\nimportant part of tractor operation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 74.—“ILLINOIS” OILING DIAGRAM]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe table calls for four lubricants, these being sewing machine oil,\r\nwhich is very thin and liquid; gas engine cylinder oil; transmission\r\noil, which is as thick as molasses; and cup grease, which is like\r\nbutter.\r\n\r\nThe engine is oiled automatically, the only requirements being to keep\r\nthe oil tank filled, and to be sure that the oiler is working. The\r\nother parts of the tractor are oiled or greased by hand.\r\n\r\nFigure 74 is the oiling chart of the Illinois tractor.\r\n\r\nThere are three systems used for engine lubrication: _splash_, _force\r\nfeed_, and by a mechanical oiler. In the splash system, a pool of oil\r\nis maintained in the crank case, of such a depth that the ends of the\r\nconnecting rods just dip into it. They strike it with sufficient force\r\nto splash it to all parts of the crank case, the oil that strikes the\r\npistons being carried up into the cylinders and lubricating the walls.\r\n\r\nThe end of the connecting rod is often fitted with a dipper, as shown\r\nin Figure 75, to strike into the oil, as well as an oil catcher,\r\nshown in the same drawing, which is a little trough that catches the\r\nsplashing oil and guides it to the connecting rod bearing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 75.—END OF “TWIN CITY” CONNECTING ROD]\r\n\r\nTo oil the wrist pin bearing there is an oil groove around the piston\r\nthat collects oil from the cylinder walls; a hole connects this groove\r\nwith the hollow wrist pin, from which other oil holes lead to the\r\nbearing. This is shown in Figure 76.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 76.—WRIST PIN LUBRICATION]\r\n\r\nIn the force feed system a pump driven by the engine forces oil through\r\npipes and channels to all of the bearing surfaces. Oil collects in a\r\npocket in the crank case, called the _sump_, and is drawn from it by\r\nthe pump. The sump is usually provided with a wire mesh strainer that\r\nseparates out any dirt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 77.—FORCE FEED OILING SYSTEM OF “GRAY” ENGINE]\r\n\r\nFrom the oil pump the oil is forced to the bearings by pipes and by\r\nholes drilled in the crank shaft and other parts, as shown in Figure 77.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 78.—OIL PUMP]\r\n\r\nAn oil pump is illustrated in Figure 78. It consists of a plunger\r\ndriven by the engine, working in a cylinder provided with two ball\r\ncheck valves, one for inlet and the other for outlet. On an upward\r\nstroke of the plunger the cylinder fills with oil, which is forced to\r\nthe engine bearings by the following inward stroke.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 79.—“E.B.” OIL PUMP]\r\n\r\nFigure 79 shows a similar pump with a strainer over the intake, the\r\noutlet being through the holes L in the pipe H. In the pump illustrated\r\nin Figure 80 the plunger is hollow, and fills with oil during an\r\ninward stroke; the oil is forced out to a passage around the plunger,\r\nand passes to the bearings by the holes H.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 80.—OIL PUMP WITH HOLLOW PLUNGER]\r\n\r\nFigure 81 shows two methods of preventing oil from leaking out around\r\nthe plunger. In the first of these, a channel is formed in the upper\r\npart of the pump cylinder, leading to the crank case; any oil that\r\nleaks past the plunger flows to the crank case by this drain pipe and\r\nis not wasted. In the second method a packing of soft material, such\r\nas cotton or asbestos, is placed around the plunger, and is pressed\r\nagainst it by a _gland_, which is like a thick washer. A _packing nut_\r\nscrews against the gland, and thus squeezes the packing against the\r\nplunger.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 81.—METHODS OF PREVENTING OIL LEAKS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 82.—“TITAN” LUBRICATOR]\r\n\r\nA _mechanical lubricator_, or _oiler_, consists of several small oil\r\npumps placed in an oil tank, each pump feeding one special bearing,\r\nand all driven by the engine. Figure 82 is a top view of a 2-cylinder\r\nhorizontal engine oiled by a six-feed oiler. The bearings that it\r\noils are the two ends of the crank shaft, the two ends of the cam\r\nshaft, and the two cylinders; the gears and other bearings are oiled\r\nby splash. An oiler is adjustable, so that it will feed any desired\r\nquantity of oil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 83.—“I.H.C.” METHOD OF OILING CRANK PINS]\r\n\r\nFigure 83 shows a side view and an end view of the crank shaft of a\r\n2-cylinder horizontal engine. To each end of the crank is attached a\r\nring, B, formed into a channel; oil splashing into this ring is thrown\r\ninto the channel by centrifugal force, and flows by holes, A, to the\r\ncrank pin bearings.\r\n\r\nThe oil forced to the cylinders from the oiler, Figure 82, reaches the\r\nwrist pin by grooves and holes, A, Figure 83.\r\n\r\nA 6-feed oiler is also shown in Figure 84.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 84.—“HART-PARR” OILING SYSTEM]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 85.—OIL CUP]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 86.—PROPER USE OF A GREASE CUP]\r\n\r\nFigure 85 is an _oil cup_, which is used to feed an individual bearing.\r\nIt is a glass cup holding oil with an opening at the bottom into which\r\nfits a needle valve. When the engine is at rest, the needle valve\r\nhandle at the top is turned down, which allows a spring to close the\r\nneedle valve; on starting the engine the needle valve is raised, and\r\nthe oil flows out by gravity. The dripping oil may be seen through a\r\nsight glass at the bottom.\r\n\r\nIn the force feed and oiler systems the oil feeds only when the engine\r\nis running, but with an oil cup the oil feeds all of the time that the\r\nneedle valve is raised. Care must therefore be taken to turn on the oil\r\ncup when starting the engine, and to turn it off when the engine is\r\nstopped.\r\n\r\nChange speed gears and differentials are usually enclosed in oil-tight\r\nhousings that contain a supply of oil or grease. The only attention\r\nthat is required is to see that they have the necessary amount, and\r\nthat the lubricant is of the right kind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 87.—“TITAN” 10-20 OILING DIAGRAM]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 88.—“INTERNATIONAL” OILING DIAGRAM]\r\n\r\nThe bearings of wheels and of many other parts of a tractor are\r\nlubricated with grease fed by _grease cups_; a grease cup has a cover\r\nthat, when screwed down, forces the grease out of a hole in the bottom\r\nof the cup. In using a grease cup it is not sufficient simply to give\r\nthe cover a turn or two; the cover should be screwed down enough to\r\nforce an ample supply of grease to the bearing. This is illustrated in\r\nFigure 86.\r\n\r\nFigures 87 and 88 are oiling diagrams. They show the many points at\r\nwhich a tractor must be lubricated, and it should be remembered that\r\nthe failure to maintain a plentiful supply of lubricant at any one of\r\nthese points will mean the wear and breakdown of that particular part.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTRACTOR OPERATION\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore running a new tractor it should be given a careful examination\r\nto make sure that all nuts and bolts are tight, and not secured only\r\nby paint; that all grease cups are in position and filled; that all\r\nparts of the mechanism are properly lubricated; that oil holes are free\r\nfrom grit, and that nothing is cracked, broken or missing. It should be\r\ncleaned of cinders and mud that may have collected in shipment, and in\r\ngeneral it should be seen to be in proper condition.\r\n\r\nA tractor, like any other piece of machinery, requires breaking in, and\r\nfor the first few days it should be run slowly and with light loads.\r\nAll parts should be plentifully oiled, for there will be rough and\r\nuneven places on the bearings that must be worn smooth, and without oil\r\nthese would heat and be injured.\r\n\r\nA continual watch should be kept for loose nuts and bolts, which should\r\nbe tightened without delay. Readjustments of the clutch and brake will\r\nbe found necessary, for their linings when new may be lumpy; as these\r\nlumps wear down through use the clutch or brake will begin to slip and\r\nmust be tightened. When the linings are worn in, this trouble will\r\ndisappear, and readjustments will be necessary only at considerable\r\nintervals.\r\n\r\nSpecial care should be taken to keep the filler caps of the fuel and\r\noil tanks clean and free from dirt. If these are dirty, the dirt will\r\nbe carried into the tank when filling, and will sooner or later cause\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\nThe vent holes in the filler caps should be kept clear. If they are\r\nplugged with dirt, air cannot enter the tank to take the place of the\r\nfuel that flows out, and the feed of fuel will stop.\r\n\r\nBeginning when the tractor is new, a system of daily inspection should\r\nbe started, and should be continued for the working season. Big trouble\r\nstarts with small trouble, and if small trouble is cured without delay,\r\nbig trouble will be avoided. Trouble usually begins with looseness,\r\nwhich may be due to a slack nut or bolt, or may come with wear. If the\r\nloose part is not tightened, it will begin to shift its position; it\r\nwill wear, and will rapidly lead to a breakdown.\r\n\r\nEvery day, without fail, all parts of the tractor should be inspected\r\nfor loose nuts, bolts, pipe and electrical connections, petcocks, drain\r\nplugs, steering connections, etc. This is also the time for wiping off\r\nthe working parts, and cleaning mud and grit from rods, shafts, joints,\r\nand other places at which dirt could make its way into bearings.\r\n\r\nThe change speed gears of a tractor should not be shifted while in\r\nmotion, this being one of the differences between a tractor and an\r\nautomobile. In the sliding gear type of change speed mechanism, the\r\ngears slide into mesh sideways, a tooth of one being opposite a space\r\nbetween two teeth of the other. If the gears are not in the right\r\nposition for this, one tooth will strike another, and the gears cannot\r\nbe meshed. In such a case the clutch is let in for a slight touch to\r\nmove one gear, not for a dozen or twenty revolutions, but enough to\r\nbring a space between two teeth of one gear opposite a tooth of the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nIf an attempt is made to shift the gears while they are in motion, the\r\nresult will be that one will grind against the other, and there will be\r\nrapid wear and probable breakage. It is because gears cannot be shifted\r\nwhile they are moving that manufacturers instruct users not to attempt\r\nto shift on a hill without first blocking the wheels. The reason for\r\nthis is that the brakes may not hold the tractor, and if the gears are\r\npulled out of mesh, the machine may start to run down hill; as another\r\nspeed cannot then be engaged because the gears are moving, there will\r\nbe no control over the tractor.\r\n\r\nNever coast down hill; always run with one of the speeds engaged. By\r\nswitching off the ignition the motion of the tractor will drive the\r\nengine, and this provides the best possible brake. On low gear, the\r\nengine will turn in the neighborhood of eighty revolutions to one turn\r\nof the driving wheels, and the work required to do this will check the\r\ntractor on the steepest of practicable grades.\r\n\r\nA tractor is not built for as accurate and delicate steering as an\r\nautomobile and should always be slowed in making a turn; this is\r\nespecially true when hauling plows or other loads in the field. It is\r\ndifficult to control the tractor if a turn is made at high speed, and\r\nthe machine is liable to tip over.\r\n\r\nIn steering and in engaging the clutch, the action should not be jerky\r\nand abrupt, but gradual and smooth. Letting in the clutch suddenly will\r\nstart the tractor with a jerk that will strain it from end to end, and\r\nan abrupt swing of the steering wheel will have the same effect. Making\r\nthese motions smoothly and steadily will cause the tractor to change\r\nits direction or pace with the least possible strain and effort. This,\r\nof course, increases the tractor’s life.\r\n\r\nIn much of the work done by the tractor, the varying conditions of\r\nfield and soil make a continual change in the load, and the tractor\r\nmust be handled accordingly. The change from an uphill to a downhill\r\nhaul, and from sand or light loam to gumbo, will require the gears\r\nto be shifted in order that the engine may neither labor nor race in\r\nkeeping the outfit at its work.\r\n\r\nThere should be no hesitation in coming down to low speed when the\r\nengine shows by its laboring that the effort of working on high gear is\r\nbecoming too great. The engine cannot deliver its full power unless its\r\nspeed is maintained, and low gear is provided for those times when the\r\nload is too great to be handled on high. Use high speed whenever it is\r\npossible, but trying to force the tractor to run on high with too great\r\na load will lead to a breakdown.\r\n\r\nHigh speed should be used for light work or for moving from place\r\nto place, but the engine should never be run at a greater number of\r\nrevolutions than that specified by the manufacturers. It is very poor\r\npolicy to run the tractor fast over rough roads, as the pounding will\r\ninevitably injure it.\r\n\r\nCold weather changes conditions in the handling and operation of a\r\ntractor; there is difficulty in starting, lubrication is likely to be\r\nfaulty, and there is danger of breakage in engine, radiator, and air\r\nwasher through freezing.\r\n\r\nDifficulty in starting comes from the use of the usual medium grade\r\nof gasoline, which is satisfactory in mild weather, but will not\r\nvaporize at low temperatures. Cold gasoline will not vaporize in a cold\r\nengine; to form a mixture it is necessary to use high test gasoline,\r\nwhich will vaporize at low temperatures, or to warm the engine to a\r\ntemperature at which medium grade gasoline will vaporize.\r\n\r\nIt is advisable to keep on hand a few gallons of high test gasoline to\r\nuse in starting, or even a mixture of high test gasoline and ether,\r\nhalf-and-half, for extreme cold weather.\r\n\r\nThe engine may be warmed by pouring a bucket of hot water into the\r\ncooling system, cranking the engine to get it into the water jackets of\r\nthe cylinders. Another plan is to wrap cloth around the intake manifold\r\nand carburetor, soaking it with hot water, being careful not to get\r\nwater into the air intake.\r\n\r\nA drop of liquid gasoline on the points of the spark plug will\r\nshort-circuit them and prevent the formation of a spark; the points\r\nshould be dry, and it is an advantage to heat the plugs, screwing them\r\nhot into the engine at the last moment before trying to start.\r\n\r\nKerosene is thicker when cold than when warm; it will not flow so\r\nfreely, and the needle valve of the carburetor must be opened more in\r\nwinter than in summer to obtain a proper mixture.\r\n\r\nLubricating oil also thickens in cold weather, and flows much more\r\nsluggishly. The lubrication adjustments that are correct for summer\r\nwill therefore be incorrect for winter. This may be provided for to\r\na great extent by using a thinner oil in winter than the oil used in\r\nsummer. A cold snap is likely to result in burned bearings if the\r\nchange in lubrication that it brings is not allowed for.\r\n\r\nGrease thickens in cold weather more than oil does, and some kinds\r\nfreeze solid. In winter a light, soft grease should be used, and the\r\ngrease cups should be turned down several more turns than is usual when\r\nthe weather is warm.\r\n\r\nWhile antifreezing compounds can be used in the cooling systems of\r\nautomobiles, they are not suitable for tractors because the greater\r\nand more continuous heat quickly evaporates them. The danger of\r\nfreezing is very great, and must be avoided; the water in the radiator\r\nand jackets is in thin sheets, and will freeze when a bucket of water\r\nstanding in the open will not show any signs of ice.\r\n\r\nThe only real protection against freezing is to drain out all the\r\nwater whenever the tractor is to stand idle for a sufficient time for\r\nit to cool off. Petcocks are provided for this at the lowest points\r\nof the system, and also in the pump when forced circulation is used.\r\nThe freezing of even a small pocket of water will be enough to crack a\r\ncast-iron water jacket wall, and the best assurance that the system is\r\nthoroughly drained is to open the drain cocks while the engine is still\r\nrunning, shutting down as the flow stops.\r\n\r\nWhen putting up a tractor for the winter it should be thoroughly\r\nprotected from rust and corrosion. The last time that the tanks are\r\nfilled a quart of light oil should be added for every five gallons of\r\ngasoline or kerosene; as the tank empties this will leave a coating of\r\noil on the inside walls.\r\n\r\nFuel tanks and water system should be drained, and particular care\r\nshould be taken that all the water is out; the drain cocks should be\r\nleft open. A mechanical oiler should be filled full, to protect the\r\nsteel parts of the pumps from rust.\r\n\r\nA half pint of thick oil should be put into each cylinder, and spread\r\nto the cylinder and piston walls by cranking for a few turns. Oil\r\nshould be run between the valves and their seats.\r\n\r\nAll exterior parts should be protected by a coat of thick oil or\r\nby paint. The governor rod, push rods, and similar parts should be\r\nespecially looked after. It is advisable to take off the magneto and\r\nstore it in a safe, dry place; spark plugs should be left in position.\r\n\r\nThe tractor should be covered with a tarpaulin and stored in a tight\r\nshed.\r\n\r\nWhen going over a tractor preparatory to laying it up, a list should\r\nbe made of all parts that need renewal. These parts should be procured\r\nat once; they are more readily obtained during the winter than in the\r\noperating season, and will be on hand for the spring overhaul.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nENGINE MAINTENANCE\r\n\r\n\r\nFUEL SYSTEM AND CARBURETOR\r\n\r\nThe operation of a carburetor depends on so many things that no exact\r\ninstructions for its adjustment can be given. The best that can be done\r\nis to give a general idea of the requirements, and to outline a plan by\r\nwhich the adjustment can be arrived at.\r\n\r\nThe many makes and designs of carburetors and vaporizers that are\r\nused on tractors have different kinds of adjustments; on most of them\r\nthe only adjustment is the needle valve that controls the fuel, but\r\nsome also have adjustable air valves. In any case, the manufacturer’s\r\ninstruction book should be studied for the understanding of the\r\nparticular carburetor in question.\r\n\r\nThe first step in adjusting a carburetor is to get the engine running.\r\nThe needle valve should be closed, and then opened enough to give a\r\nmixture on which the engine will start; on many carburetors this will\r\nbe about one and one half turns. The engine should then be _primed_;\r\nthat is, a little gasoline should be put in the cylinder, which may be\r\ndone with a squirt can.\r\n\r\nWhen the engine is running, and is well heated, the needle valve should\r\nbe gradually closed until the engine begins to miss, and to send jets\r\nof flame out of the carburetor, or little explosions occur in the\r\ncarburetor. These are signs of a thin mixture, and the needle valve\r\nshould be gradually opened to make the mixture richer. The engine will\r\nrun more steadily, and will pick up speed until the mixture becomes too\r\nrich, when it will choke and black smoke will come out of the exhaust.\r\n\r\nThe positions of the needle valve for a mixture that is too thin and\r\none that is too rich have thus been found, and it remains to set it at\r\nthat point between at which the engine runs most steadily and at the\r\nbest speed.\r\n\r\nWith adjustable air valves it is usual to adjust for idling, that is,\r\nthe slowest speed at which the engine will run steadily without load,\r\nand then to make any necessary additional adjustment for full speed and\r\npower.\r\n\r\nIf a carburetor cannot be adjusted by following the usual methods,\r\ntrouble may be looked for, and this may be in the carburetor itself,\r\nin the fuel supply, or in the intake manifold, taking for granted, of\r\ncourse, that the engine is in proper condition and that the ignition\r\nsystem is operating correctly.\r\n\r\nDirt under the float valve will prevent the valve from seating, and the\r\nlevel in the float chamber will be too high, so that the mixture is\r\ntoo rich. Lifting the valve from its seat will let fuel rush through,\r\nand loose particles will thus be washed away. If dirt is ground into\r\nthe valve and seat, or if these parts are worn, the valve must be\r\nreseated, which is done by turning the valve against its seat with\r\nlight pressure, the end of the valve being gently tapped with a light\r\nhammer. Under no conditions use a grinding compound, for the particles\r\nwould become imbedded in the soft metal and would ruin the valve.\r\n\r\nOther causes of flooding are a bent valve, the sticking of the float\r\npivot, and the soaking of fuel into the cork float, which is thereby\r\nmade too heavy to float properly. The remedy is to dry it, and then to\r\ngive it three coats of shellac.\r\n\r\nA frequent cause of trouble is dirt in the pipe from the tank to the\r\ncarburetor. While there may not be enough dirt to prevent the engine\r\nfrom running slowly, it is sufficient to prevent the flow of sufficient\r\nfuel for full power. A strainer is always provided, and this should be\r\ndrained every day; if this is not done frequently, dirt will work its\r\nway through.\r\n\r\nA grain of sand in the spray nozzle will choke it, and every precaution\r\nshould be taken to keep this from happening, as well as the other\r\ntroubles that dirt brings. The best precaution is to strain the fuel\r\nthrough chamois leather, or, if this is not obtainable, through a very\r\nfine metal wire screen.\r\n\r\nIn fuel systems that use a pump, the sticking of the check valves, and\r\nthe leaking of the pump through poor packing, will cut down the supply\r\nof fuel.\r\n\r\nIf air can leak into the carburetor or intake manifold, the proportions\r\nof the mixture will be altered. To test for leaks, run the engine, and\r\nwith a squirt can squirt gasoline on the joints or other places that\r\nare suspected of leaking air. If there is a leak, the gasoline can be\r\nseen being sucked in.\r\n\r\nAir must enter the tank to take the place of the fuel that flows out,\r\nand this is provided for by a small hole drilled in the tank-filling\r\ncap. If this hole becomes stopped up, the fuel will not flow, and the\r\nengine will come to a stop. There is a similar hole in the top of the\r\nfloat bowl of most carburetors, and this also must be kept open.\r\n\r\nAn engine is always started on gasoline, for that will form a mixture\r\nwhen it is cold. Before switching to kerosene the engine must be hot,\r\nand this will take several minutes of running on gasoline.\r\n\r\nWith a double carburetor, which has a separate fuel bowl and spray\r\nnozzle for each fuel, nothing more is required than the switching\r\nof one or the other into action; when the two parts have once been\r\nadjusted, they require no further adjustment. Carburetors that use\r\nthe same spray nozzle for both gasoline and kerosene will require a\r\nreadjustment when the switch is made, for, as kerosene is thicker than\r\ngasoline, it will require a larger opening for a sufficient quantity\r\nto pass. This readjustment is a slight opening of the needle valve on\r\nswitching to kerosene, and an equal closing when gasoline is again\r\nused.\r\n\r\nA few minutes before the engine is stopped the carburetor should be\r\nswitched from kerosene to gasoline, so that when it is shut down the\r\nfuel bowl will contain gasoline and the cylinders gasoline mixture.\r\nThis is done to make it possible to start the engine. If the engine is\r\nstopped on kerosene, it cannot be started if it has had time to cool.\r\nIn such a case the fuel bowl must be drained of kerosene and filled\r\nwith gasoline, and the engine must be cranked until the cylinders\r\nreceive a clean gasoline mixture.\r\n\r\nWhen an engine is working at full power on kerosene, it gets much\r\nhotter than would be the case with a gasoline mixture. Carbon particles\r\nin the cylinder, and projecting bits of metal, such as thin spark plug\r\npoints or the edge of a screw thread, become so hot that they glow,\r\nwith the result that they ignite the incoming fresh charge and cause\r\npreignition. The effect of this is to cause a pounding or knocking\r\nthat is very noticeable. It is then necessary to use water, which is\r\nprovided for in the carburetor.\r\n\r\nWater has the effect of cooling the intensely heated parts, and only\r\nenough should be used to prevent preignition. When the knocking is\r\nheard, water should gradually be turned on, using no more than is\r\nnecessary to stop the noise. Too much water will cause the engine to\r\nmiss by collecting on the spark plug points, thereby preventing the\r\npassing of the ignition spark.\r\n\r\nHard water should not be used, for it will form scale, which will\r\ninterfere with the action of the carburetor. Only soft water should be\r\nused, and preferably rain water.\r\n\r\nWhenever the engine is stopped, the fuel valve at the tank should be\r\nclosed to shut off the carburetor supply. If this is not done, the\r\nfloat valve will be the only thing that prevents the fuel from running\r\nout, and should the float valve leak, the fuel will be wasted.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAGNETO AND IGNITION SYSTEM\r\n\r\nA magneto that is kept clean and properly oiled rarely gives trouble,\r\nand it is a mistake to blame it whenever the engine runs irregularly or\r\nwill not start. Its adjustments should be changed only when the other\r\nparts of the engine have been proved to be in good condition.\r\n\r\nThe working parts of a magneto are enclosed, and practically proof\r\nagainst dust. It should be wiped off frequently, and dust and grit\r\nshould not be allowed to collect around the oil holes, for otherwise it\r\nwill work into the bearings and damage them.\r\n\r\nDust and dirt are especially injurious to the circuit breaker, which\r\nshould be frequently inspected and cleaned. Very little oil should be\r\nused on it, and this should be the light oil used for typewriters and\r\nsewing machines. A thicker oil will become gummy, and will prevent the\r\nfree action of the lever.\r\n\r\nIf there is much sparking at the platinum points, so that they become\r\ncorroded and rough, it is an indication that the condenser of the\r\nmagneto is not operating as it should, for the object of the condenser\r\nis to prevent such sparking. The only remedy is to renew the condenser.\r\n\r\nRough points will spark more than smooth ones; should they get into\r\nthis condition, they should be lightly filed with a file of the cut\r\nknown as “dead smooth.” If this file cannot be obtained, pinch a strip\r\nof the finest sand paper—not emery paper—between the points, and draw\r\nit gently back and forth, smoothing down first one point and then the\r\nother. In smoothing platinum points the greatest care should be taken\r\nto make them flat and true to each other.\r\n\r\nAfter smoothing the points they should be readjusted so that when they\r\nare separated by the cam they are from ¹/₃₂ to ¹/₆₄ inch apart.\r\n\r\nA distributor made with a carbon brush that slides across the contacts\r\nwill require wiping off at least once a month. Carbon dust will rub off\r\nthe brush and collect on the face of the distributor; in the course of\r\ntime this will cause a short-circuit. The distributor is always made so\r\nthat it can easily be cleaned.\r\n\r\nA magneto is timed to an engine so that when the spark control is fully\r\nretarded, the circuit breaker points are just separating as a piston\r\ngoes over top center. The engine is cranked until one of the pistons\r\nis at top center; the magneto should be in position, but its coupling\r\nshould be loose, so that the armature can be revolved. The spark\r\ncontrol is retarded; that is, it is moved as far as possible in the\r\ndirection in which the armature turns. The armature is then revolved\r\nin the direction in which it will be driven by the engine until it is\r\nseen that the contact points are beginning to separate; holding the\r\narmature, the coupling is then made fast.\r\n\r\nIt will now be found that the distributor brush is touching one of\r\nthe contacts; that contact is to be connected with the spark plug of\r\nthe cylinder that is at top center of the compression stroke. The\r\nfollowing distributor contacts are connected to the remaining spark\r\nplugs in the order in which their cylinders fire.\r\n\r\nShould the magneto be suspected of being out of order, the first test\r\nis to disconnect a wire from its spark plug, and support the tip ⅛ inch\r\nfrom the metal of the engine while the engine is cranked briskly; if a\r\nspark appears, it is evidence that the magneto is operating and that\r\nthe trouble is elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIf there is no spark, repeat the test with the switch wire disconnected\r\nfrom the magneto. This wire and the switch form a circuit from the\r\nmetal of the engine to the insulated part of the circuit breaker;\r\nwhen the switch is closed, or in the “off” position, this circuit is\r\ncompleted, and as the magneto current flows over it instead of over\r\nthe regular sparking circuit, no spark is produced at the plug. It\r\nsometimes happens that the switch or wire is defective, and allows the\r\ncurrent to take that circuit even when the switch is in the open or\r\n“run” position. If this is the case it will be shown by a spark on\r\ncranking the engine with the switch wire disconnected at the magneto,\r\nand no spark when it is connected.\r\n\r\nIf the switch and wire are all right, examine the circuit breaker to\r\nsee whether the contact points are clean, and that they touch when the\r\ncam allows them to; touch the circuit breaker lever to see that it is\r\nfree to move and that its spring is not broken. In some tractors the\r\nmagneto is in such a position that the circuit breaker cannot easily\r\nbe seen; in such a case hold a small mirror in front of the circuit\r\nbreaker and examine the reflection.\r\n\r\nIf the circuit breaker is in good condition, examine the distributor to\r\nsee whether it is dirty, or the brush broken; if these parts are all\r\nright, the trouble is of such a character as requires the magneto to be\r\nreturned for repair.\r\n\r\nIgnition trouble is usually in the spark plugs. The insulator cracks\r\neasily in many makes, which will permit the current to leak across\r\nwithout forming a spark; it is frequently the case that the crack does\r\nnot show, and the best test is to replace the suspected plug with a\r\nplug that is known to be good. If the cylinder fires with one plug and\r\nnot with the other, there is no question as to the cause of the trouble.\r\n\r\nThe insulator of the plug must be kept clean, for a deposit of carbon\r\non it will form a path by which the current can pass without forming\r\na spark. A dirty plug can best be cleaned by brushing it with a stiff\r\ntoothbrush dipped in gasoline. A carbon deposit can be softened by\r\nsoaking the plug in gasoline for a few hours, and can then be brushed\r\noff more easily.\r\n\r\nThe spark gap of a plug should be from ¹/₃₂ to ¹/₆₄ inch. After\r\nconsiderable use the points will be burned off, and the gap will become\r\ntoo wide; the points should then be bent to form a proper gap.\r\n\r\nOil and grease will rot rubber, and the ignition wires should\r\ntherefore be wiped clean. Oil-soaked cables will give trouble, and\r\nshould be replaced with new ones.\r\n\r\nIt is frequently difficult to locate a leakage of current. If the\r\nengine is misfiring and losing power, and a leakage of current through\r\npoor insulation is suspected, the easiest way to detect it is to run\r\nthe engine in the dark. Leaks will show themselves by sparks, which are\r\nthen easily seen.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPRESSION\r\n\r\nIn order to deliver its full power a gas engine must have good\r\ncompression, and compression should frequently be tested by cranking\r\nthe engine slowly and steadily with the ignition switched off. If\r\ncompression is good, there will be a springy, elastic resistance\r\nthat becomes greater as a piston approaches the end of a compression\r\nstroke, and that throws the piston outward as dead center is passed.\r\nCompression should be the same for all cylinders.\r\n\r\nIf there is a leakage of compression, the only resistance will be from\r\nthe bearings, and it will be the same for all parts of the stroke.\r\n\r\nA compression leak often makes a hissing noise that can be distinctly\r\nheard, and by which it can be located, but more often it makes no\r\nsound, and its location must be found by testing. The leak may be at\r\nany of the openings into the combustion space; at the valves, around\r\nthe spark plugs or piston rings, or at the cylinder head gasket.\r\n\r\nTo discover whether the gasket leaks, run gasoline along the line of\r\nthe gasket joint with a squirt can while the engine is being cranked\r\nbriskly; at a leaky place it will be sucked in or blown out. The same\r\ntest should be made around the spark plug.\r\n\r\nThe remedy is to reset the cylinder head, using a new gasket, and being\r\nsure that the surfaces are clean and free from grit.\r\n\r\nPiston ring leaks are usually caused by the rings sticking in their\r\ngrooves through the formation of carbon. To test for piston ring\r\nleaks, pour a half pint of cylinder oil into each cylinder, and crank\r\nthe engine slowly. The oil will form a seal around the pistons, and if\r\ncompression is then improved, the rings are shown to be at fault.\r\n\r\nTo free the rings, pour a few tablespoonfuls of kerosene into each\r\ncylinder, and spread it by giving the engine a few turns; after\r\nstanding for an hour or so the carbon should be sufficiently softened\r\nto free the rings.\r\n\r\nIf the leakage of compression is due to the rings being worn and loose\r\nin their grooves, they must be replaced.\r\n\r\nThe most usual cause of compression loss is leaking valves. With its\r\ncontinual pounding against its seat, and the heat to which it is\r\nexposed, a valve and its seat will become rough and pitted, and will\r\nleak; when in this condition the valve must be ground.\r\n\r\nA valve is ground by spreading grinding compound on the seat, and\r\nturning the valve against it. This requires the valve spring to be\r\ntaken off; the exact method of doing this depends on how these parts\r\nare made.\r\n\r\nIf the valves are in a removable cylinder head, valve grinding is most\r\neasily done by taking the cylinder head to a bench. In many designs the\r\nvalve seats are part of the cylinder casting, and the job is done on\r\nthe tractor.\r\n\r\nIn grinding a valve the valve is not turned around in one direction\r\nonly, for this would cut grooves in the valve and seat. To obtain\r\nsmooth surfaces the valve should be given part of a turn in one\r\ndirection, and then turned equally in the other direction; after every\r\nfew turns the valve should be lifted and dropped to another position on\r\nthe seat. In this way the grinding is made even all around.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 89.—GRINDING VALVE IN ENGINE WITH FIXED HEAD]\r\n\r\nThe best tool for valve grinding is a carpenter’s brace with a screw\r\ndriver blade fitting the slot in the valve, as shown in Figure 89.\r\nThis drawing illustrates a cylinder with a fixed head; the valve is\r\nreached by unscrewing the plug from the opening directly above it. When\r\ngrinding valves in an engine of this design the opening between the\r\nvalve pocket and the combustion space should be plugged with a rag or\r\nwaste to prevent the grinding compound from getting into the cylinder.\r\n\r\nWith the valve grinding tool in position, swing the handle back and\r\nforth ten or twelve times; then lift the valve, place it in a new\r\nposition, and repeat. The valve is lifted most easily by a light spring\r\nplaced under the valve disk, as shown in Figure 89.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time the valve disk and seat should be cleaned off and\r\nexamined to see whether they are smooth and free from pits and scores.\r\nIf they appear to be, make marks around the valve disk with a lead\r\npencil, replace the valve, and give it a complete turn. If this wipes\r\noff the pencil marks all around the valve, the grinding is complete,\r\nand the valve may be replaced with its spring and spring retainer. It\r\nis not necessary to grind until the entire thickness of the valve disk\r\nand seat are smooth; a narrow band all around will make the valve tight.\r\n\r\nAfter grinding, and before replacing the valve, all traces of the\r\ngrinding compound should be wiped off, and great care taken that none\r\nof it gets into the cylinder, valve stem guide, or other working part.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 90.—GRINDING VALVE IN DETACHABLE HEAD]\r\n\r\nOn an engine with a removable head containing the valves, the head\r\nmay be taken to a work bench, which makes grinding easier. This is\r\nillustrated in Figure 90. On an engine in which the valve and its seat\r\nmay be taken out, the seat may be clamped in a vise, as shown in Figure\r\n91. With valves of either of these types, the grinding may be tested by\r\nturning the head or the seat so that the disk is down, and pouring in\r\ngasoline. If the valve is not tight, the gasoline will leak through,\r\nand grinding must be continued.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 91.—GRINDING VALVE IN DETACHABLE SEAT]\r\n\r\nWhen a valve seat is very badly worn it must be redressed, which is\r\ndone with a cutting tool to be obtained from the maker of the tractor,\r\nand illustrated in Figure 92. This has a stem fitting the valve stem\r\nguide which centers the tool and assures a true cut. If a seat is so\r\nworn as to need redressing, the valve will be in such bad condition\r\nthat it must be discarded and a new one used. This must be ground in\r\nbefore the engine is run.\r\n\r\nGrinding a valve lowers it in its seat, and usually makes it necessary\r\nto readjust the push rod. When an engine is cold there is a space of\r\nabout ¹/₃₂ inch somewhere between the cam and the valve stem; in Figure\r\n93, this space is shown to be between the valve stem and the rocker\r\narm. As the engine heats up the valve stem lengthens, and this space\r\npermits it to do so.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 92.—VALVE SEAT CUTTER]\r\n\r\nIf the space is too small, the stem will come against the rocker arm\r\nor the push rod, and the valve will be held off its seat, causing\r\na compression leak. If the space is too great, the valve will open\r\ntoo late and close too early. The space must therefore be carefully\r\nadjusted, and this is arranged for on practically all makes of tractor\r\nengines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 93.—“HOLT” VALVE ARRANGEMENT]\r\n\r\nOne-thirty-second of an inch is the thickness of a 10-cent piece; it\r\nshould just be possible to slip a slightly worn dime into the space\r\nwhen the engine is cold.\r\n\r\n\r\nVALVE TIMING\r\n\r\nBy _timing the valves_ is meant the setting of the cam shaft in such a\r\nposition that the valves are opened at the correct point in the stroke.\r\nIt is necessary to time the valves only when the cam shaft has been\r\ntaken out and must be replaced. The principle of valve timing should be\r\nunderstood, however, in order to be able to tell whether an engine is\r\ntimed correctly.\r\n\r\nIt will usually be found that the face of the flywheel bears letters\r\nand figures that are indicators of the timing of the valves. This\r\narrangement on the E-B engines is shown in Figure 94. Two lines are\r\ncut in the face of the flywheel, one marked ex. cl. 1-4, which means\r\nexhaust valve closes, cylinders 1 and 4, and the other marked CENTER\r\n1-4, to indicate that the pistons in those cylinders are on center. A\r\nstraight-edge is held against the finished surface of the housing and\r\nthe crank shaft is turned to bring one of the marks in line with it; at\r\nthat point the valves or pistons are as indicated by the lettering.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 94.—VALVE TIMING, USING MARKS ON FLYWHEEL]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 95.—VALVE TIMING]\r\n\r\nThe flywheel is also marked with a dot to indicate the firing point.\r\nWhen the dot is in line with the straight-edge, ignition should occur\r\nwith the spark control fully advanced.\r\n\r\nFigure 95 shows the valve arrangement of the same engine, with the\r\nexhaust valve just closing; the point of the cam has passed under the\r\nlifter or push rod, and has permitted the valve to come to its seat,\r\nbut is still holding the lifter against the valve stem.\r\n\r\nTo check the valve setting, hold a slip of tissue paper, such as a\r\ncigarette paper, in the space between the lifter and the valve stem,\r\nwhile the engine is cranked slowly. While the cam is holding the valve\r\noff its seat the paper will be pinched between the lifter and the valve\r\nstem and held firmly. At the instant when the paper is freed and can\r\nbe moved, the valve is seated and the point of the cam is just passing\r\nfrom under; the proper mark on the flywheel should then be in line with\r\nthe straight-edge.\r\n\r\nAs the cams for all valves are in one piece with the cam shaft, setting\r\none valve sets them all and checking the setting of one checks the\r\nsetting of all.\r\n\r\nBefore taking out a cam shaft, two adjoining teeth of its gear should\r\nbe marked with a prick punch or a small cold chisel, and a similar mark\r\nshould be made on the tooth of the crank shaft gear that comes between\r\nthem. In replacing the cam shaft it is then necessary only to return\r\nthe teeth to the same position. Timing gears are usually marked in this\r\nway by the manufacturers.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARBON\r\n\r\nA kerosene lamp that is turned too high gives a dense black smoke that\r\nis composed of fine particles of carbon. A piece of paper held in the\r\nsmoke is quickly covered with a deposit of carbon, commonly called\r\nsoot, or lamp-black.\r\n\r\nAll fuel oils and lubricating oils contain carbon. When these oils\r\nburn in the cylinder, they produce carbon, much of which passes out\r\nof the exhaust, while the rest deposits on the valves and on all parts\r\nof the combustion space. This deposit hardens, and eventually makes\r\ntrouble through causing preignition.\r\n\r\nThe deposit is rough, and the heat in the cylinder is sufficient to\r\nmake the outstanding particles glow; they ignite the incoming charge,\r\nand cause preignition. The sign of carbon trouble is a sharp knocking\r\nin the cylinder, especially when the engine is under a heavy load. The\r\nsound is the same as that caused by too great an advance of the spark.\r\n\r\nCarbon deposit can be greatly reduced by pouring a few tablespoonfuls\r\nof kerosene into each cylinder and cranking for a few turns to spread\r\nit to all parts of the combustion space. This will soften the carbon\r\nand much of it will be blown out when the engine is next started. Best\r\nresults will be obtained if the kerosene is poured in after a run, when\r\nthe engine is hot.\r\n\r\nIf the carbon deposit is too hard to be softened by kerosene, it can\r\nbe removed by scraping. This requires the cylinder head to be taken\r\noff, when the deposit can be scraped and chipped with a screwdriver.\r\nCare should be taken to keep the carbon crumbs from getting into the\r\ncylinders, valve stem guides, or other places where it would cause wear.\r\n\r\nIn taking off the cylinder head the gasket should be handled carefully,\r\nand protected from denting and bending. A battered or bent gasket is a\r\nsure cause of compression leaks. In replacing a metal gasket, give it a\r\ncoat of cylinder oil on both sides to improve its seating.\r\n\r\nWhen replacing the cylinder head, set all of the bolts up a little at\r\na time, instead of screwing some of them tight while others are loose.\r\nOne bolt drawn tight may tilt the cylinder head slightly, and there\r\nwill be a distortion when another bolt is tightened. This is avoided by\r\nsetting up all of the bolts a little at a time.\r\n\r\nRunning on too rich a mixture, giving the engine too much oil, and not\r\nusing an air cleaner in dusty work will carbonize an engine rapidly.\r\nBlue smoke at the exhaust is a sign that too much lubricating oil is\r\nbeing used; black smoke indicates too rich a mixture. Carbonizing\r\ncan be greatly reduced by careful adjustment of the lubricator and\r\ncarburetor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nLOCATING TROUBLE\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are many ways in which an engine can give trouble, but these are\r\nnot serious to an operator who understands the action of an engine,\r\nand who works with his brain as well as with his hands. Each of these\r\ntroubles has a distinct cause; proper care will avoid them, but if they\r\ncome the reasons for them can be determined by simple tests.\r\n\r\nIn order to develop full power, an engine must be in good mechanical\r\ncondition; that is, the bearings must be free without being loose,\r\nthe gears must run well, the pistons and their rings must not bind or\r\nbe too free, and so on. It must be properly lubricated and cooled,\r\ncompression must be correct, it must get a good mixture, and ignition\r\nmust take place at the right time. If an engine gives trouble, it is\r\nbecause one of these systems is not working properly, and it is not at\r\nall difficult to locate the cause and to correct it.\r\n\r\nIf an engine gets a good mixture, which is ignited properly, it will\r\nrun; if it will not give any explosions it is because one or the other\r\nof these systems is not working properly. An inspection or a simple\r\ntest will show which one is at fault.\r\n\r\n\r\nENGINE WILL NOT START\r\n\r\nIf an engine will not start after being cranked a dozen or twenty\r\ntimes, it is useless to continue to crank it. It is not getting either\r\na proper mixture or an ignition spark, and it saves time and energy to\r\nfind out where the trouble is, rather than to keep on cranking in the\r\nhope that something may happen.\r\n\r\nWhen a tractor engine refuses to start, the trouble is usually with the\r\nmixture, and, more often than not, this is due to carelessness or to\r\nforgetfulness. The tank may be empty, or the fuel valve may be closed,\r\nso that the carburetor is dry; see if there is fuel in the carburetor\r\nbowl. The engine may have been shut down while running on kerosene,\r\ninstead of having been switched to gasoline for the last few minutes of\r\nits run, so that the carburetor, intake manifold and cylinders contain\r\nkerosene, which will not vaporize without heat, instead of gasoline,\r\nwhich will. In this case the engine must be primed with gasoline.\r\n\r\nIf too much gasoline has been used for priming, the cylinders may\r\ncontain a mixture that is too rich to ignite; the engine should then be\r\ncranked briskly with the fuel shut off and the compression relief cocks\r\nopen, to clear out the rich mixture and fill the cylinders with air.\r\n\r\nWater in the fuel will make starting difficult or impossible. It is\r\neasy to forget to shut off the water valve of the carburetor when\r\nstopping the engine, and when starting, water from this valve will\r\nprevent the forming of a mixture and will also interfere with the\r\nignition.\r\n\r\nIf the mixture is apparently all right, the fault may be in the\r\nignition. A drop of liquid fuel or of water, for instance, may be on\r\nthe spark plug points; this will short-circuit them and no spark will\r\nbe formed, although the sparking current is passing.\r\n\r\nIf there is a suspicion that the ignition system is at fault, and that\r\nthe magneto is not producing a sparking current, it should be tested,\r\nas explained in Chapter XII.\r\n\r\nStarting in cold weather is always more difficult than starting when it\r\nis warm. Helps in cold weather starting are given in Chapter XI.\r\n\r\nA leaky inlet manifold will admit an extra amount of air that will\r\ncompletely alter the proportions of a mixture. Thus the mixture will\r\nbe wrong, although the carburetor adjustment seems to be correct.\r\nManifold leaks are usually at the joints, but occasionally a manifold\r\nis found with a hole in it due to poor casting or material, or a crack\r\nmay develop.\r\n\r\nDifficulty in starting due to poor compression caused by stuck valves\r\nor rings will show its cause by the ease with which the engine can be\r\ncranked.\r\n\r\nIf an engine is free enough to turn over, poor lubrication or cooling\r\nwill not interfere with starting it. Faults in these systems show\r\nthemselves only when an engine is running.\r\n\r\n\r\nENGINE LOSES POWER\r\n\r\nAn engine will lose power through a defect of compression, carburetion,\r\nignition, cooling or lubrication, or because of a mechanical fault.\r\n\r\nIf the trouble comes from cooling or lubrication, the engine will\r\noverheat and thus make the cause known. A bearing that binds will\r\nbecome very hot, while if the cooling system fails, the engine will be\r\nhot all over. When the engine is excessively hot, the pistons will\r\nexpand, and much of the power of the engine will be used up in forcing\r\nthem to move.\r\n\r\nAn engine that is not hotter than usual, and is having regular and even\r\nexplosions, probably loses power through a loss of compression. This is\r\nthe most usual cause of this trouble, and it is located and remedied as\r\nexplained in Chapter XII.\r\n\r\nIf compression is good, the loss of power may be due to a clogged\r\nmuffler or exhaust pipe, which will not permit the free escape of the\r\nburned gases. This condition will prevent full charges of fresh mixture\r\nfrom entering the cylinders, and the engine then cannot be expected to\r\ndeliver full power.\r\n\r\nAnother possible cause of a loss of power with the engine apparently in\r\nproper condition is the sticking or poor adjustment of the governor.\r\nThe factory adjustment of the governor should not be changed, however,\r\nuntil it is definitely proved that that is where the trouble lies.\r\n\r\nIf the engine misses fire, or runs irregularly, the loss of power\r\nwill be due to faulty carburetion or ignition. The mixture may be\r\ntoo rich or too lean; in either case the trouble will be remedied by\r\nreadjusting the carburetor. A mixture that is very much too lean will\r\nmake itself known by _backfiring_; there will be little explosions at\r\nthe carburetor. This should be remedied at once, for the danger of\r\nfire from it is very great. Black smoke at the exhaust is a sign of a\r\nmixture that is too rich.\r\n\r\nAn engine will not deliver full power if it is run on a retarded\r\nspark. A loss of power from this cause will be accompanied by general\r\noverheating of the engine.\r\n\r\n\r\nENGINE STOPS\r\n\r\nThe manner in which an engine stops will indicate the reason for it.\r\n\r\nA failure of the ignition system that stops the formation of current,\r\nlike the sticking of the circuit breaker lever, will cut off all\r\nexplosions instantly; the engine will stop abruptly. An engine will not\r\nstop abruptly from any fault with the mixture; with mixture trouble the\r\nexplosions will become weaker and weaker until they cease.\r\n\r\nIf an engine stops through a failure of the lubrication or cooling\r\nsystems it will be intensely hot, which will not be the case if the\r\nfault is with carburetion or ignition.\r\n\r\nA running engine will not be brought to a stop by a loss of compression.\r\n\r\n\r\nENGINE MISSES\r\n\r\nA steady or irregular miss in one cylinder is usually due to the spark\r\nplug’s being cracked or dirty. Carburetor trouble will affect all the\r\ncylinders; it cannot affect one cylinder only, and missing in one\r\ncylinder may be put down as ignition trouble. In this case ignition\r\ntrouble does not mean magneto trouble, for if the magneto produces\r\nsparking current for one cylinder it will produce it for all. Therefore\r\nignition trouble in only one cylinder is in those parts of the\r\nignition system supplying that cylinder; that is, in the spark plug or\r\nin the spark plug cable.\r\n\r\nA less likely cause for missing in one cylinder only is poor\r\ncompression. It is usually the case that if compression is poor in one\r\ncylinder it is poor in them all, but a broken valve or piston ring or a\r\nweak valve spring will weaken compression in one and not in the others.\r\n\r\nA cylinder that misses is cooler than the others, and can be located by\r\nfeeling. It can also be located by short-circuiting the spark plugs one\r\nat a time; this will make no difference in the dead cylinder, but when\r\nthe spark plug of an active cylinder is short-circuited the speed of\r\nthe engine will drop.\r\n\r\nTo short-circuit a spark plug, take a wooden-handled screwdriver or\r\nother tool and rest the blade on the engine near the spark plug; then\r\ntilt until its shank is close to the spark plug terminal. The spark\r\ncurrent will then pass to the metal of the engine by way of the tool\r\ninstead of by the spark plug points. This is also a test of ignition,\r\nfor a spark will pass between the terminal and the tool.\r\n\r\nIrregular missing in all cylinders may be due to a fault at one of\r\nthe parts of the ignition system that supplies them all; a dirty\r\ndistributor, for instance, or a sticking circuit breaker lever, or\r\nrough platinum points. It may also be due to a clogged fuel line, which\r\nprevents the carburetor from getting a regular and sufficient flow.\r\n\r\nIrregular missing will also be caused by loose ignition connections,\r\nand by loose switch parts.\r\n\r\n\r\nENGINE STARTS; BUT STOPS\r\n\r\nWhen an engine starts readily but quickly slows down and stops, the\r\nreason is almost always an insufficient supply of fuel. An obstruction\r\nin the pipe may prevent the fuel from flowing fast enough to keep the\r\ncarburetor bowl filled when the engine is running; when the engine\r\nstarts, the fuel is sucked out of the spray nozzle faster than it comes\r\nin through the float valve, so the carburetor is soon drained and the\r\nengine stops. The bowl then fills, only to be sucked dry again when the\r\nengine is next started.\r\n\r\nThis difficulty is caused by dirt in the fuel, which collects in the\r\nstrainer or the fuel pipe. The strainer is so arranged that it may be\r\neasily drained and cleaned; to clear out the pipe, shut off the fuel at\r\nthe tank, disconnect the pipe at both ends, and blow through it.\r\n\r\nThe strainer should be drained every day; it is sufficient to open the\r\nstrainer drain cock for two or three seconds.\r\n\r\nMost of the troubles due to dirt in the fuel will be avoided if the\r\nfuel is strained when filling the tank.\r\n\r\nAnother thing that will bring an engine to a stop is the clogging of\r\nthe vent holes in the tank filler cap and in the top of the carburetor\r\nbowl. These holes should be clear, so that air can enter to replace\r\nthe fuel that is used; if air cannot enter the fuel will not flow, and\r\nthe tank is then said to be _air-bound_.\r\n\r\n\r\nENGINE OVERHEATS\r\n\r\nAn engine may overheat either because it produces more heat than the\r\ncooling system can take care of, or because the cooling system is not\r\ntaking off all of the heat that it should.\r\n\r\nRunning an engine with the spark retarded will cause it to overheat; so\r\nwill a failure of the lubrication and an obstruction to the passage of\r\nthe exhaust gases.\r\n\r\nIf an engine has been taken down and overheats when it is reassembled,\r\nit may be that the magneto has been wrongly timed, and produces its\r\nspark too late. If an engine has been running properly but begins to\r\noverheat, the ignition cause will be the faulty setting of the spark\r\ncontrol, or the slipping of the spark control rod.\r\n\r\nWhen an engine is run on kerosene, the oil in the crankcase must be\r\nfrequently drained off and replaced with fresh oil. The reason for\r\nthis is that part of the kerosene that goes to the cylinders does not\r\nvaporize and burn, but works its way past the pistons and into the\r\ncrankcase, where it thins the lubricating oil. As the oil thins, it\r\nloses its ability to lubricate, and the engine begins to overheat.\r\n\r\nAnything that produces extra friction will cause overheating, as, for\r\nexample, a wrist pin that works endways and rubs against the cylinder\r\nwall, or a tight bearing.\r\n\r\nFor a cooling system to work properly it must contain a full supply of\r\nwater, the passages must be clear, sufficient air must pass through the\r\nradiator, and the pump must be in proper condition.\r\n\r\nHose connections will rot, and a strip of rubber may peel off the\r\ninside and be drawn across the passage; or if dirty water is used, the\r\ndirt may choke the fine radiator passages or other channels. If the\r\nradiator is covered with mud, air cannot get at the tubes to take the\r\nheat from the water that they contain.\r\n\r\nA very usual cause of overheating is a slipping fan belt; an adjustment\r\nis provided by which the belt can be tightened when it works loose.\r\n\r\n\r\nENGINE SMOKES\r\n\r\nBlack smoke indicates that the mixture is too rich; blue smoke is a\r\nsign of too plentiful lubrication. Oil that is too thin, or that is\r\nof a poor grade, will cause smoking; good quality oil of the grade\r\nrecommended by the manufacturer should always be used.\r\n\r\nBroken piston rings, or rings stuck in their grooves, will be the cause\r\nof smoking because they will permit an excess of oil to pass by them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nCAUSES OF TROUBLE\r\n\r\n\r\n    Engine will not start.
