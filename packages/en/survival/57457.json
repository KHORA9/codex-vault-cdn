As the editor of this printing, Rev. Walter Skeat, notes\r\n  in his Introduction: “The present volume contains a careful reprint\r\n  of Berthelet’s edition of 1534” collated throughout “with the\r\n  curious edition of 1598” that was authored by “I. R.”--his actual\r\n  name is unknown.\r\n\r\n  This “careful reprint” retains all the spelling variations and\r\n  inconsistencies of those original editions, and so does this etext.\r\n  The Notes and Sidenotes produced by Skeat are of course in modern\r\n  (1882) English. He has inserted some corrections to the reprinted\r\n  text; these are shown in [brackets]. Obvious typographical errors\r\n  and punctuation errors in his Notes and Sidenotes have been\r\n  corrected after careful comparison with other occurrences within\r\n  the text and consultation of external sources.\r\n\r\n  Some minor changes are listed at the end of the book.\r\n\r\n  Footnote anchors are denoted by [number], and the footnotes have\r\n  been placed at the end of each major section of the book.\r\n\r\n  The line numbering on each section of the reprinted 1534 text has\r\n  been retained and is shown as a number (4, 8, 12 etc) on the right\r\n  side of the etext. Original line-breaks in the 1534 text have been\r\n  retained.\r\n\r\n  Italic text is denoted by _underscores_.\r\n\r\n  Bold text is denoted by =equal signs=.\r\n\r\n  The 3-star inverted asterism symbol is denoted by ***.\r\n\r\n  The right-pointing finger symbol is denoted by ==>.\r\n\r\n  A superscript is denoted by ^n or ^{nn}, for example xxix^{th}.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  FITZHERBERT’S\r\n  BOOK OF HUSBANDRY.\r\n\r\n  1534.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE\r\n\r\n  BOOK OF HUSBANDRY,\r\n\r\n  BY\r\n\r\n  MASTER FITZHERBERT.\r\n\r\n\r\n  REPRINTED FROM THE EDITION OF 1534,\r\n\r\n  AND EDITED\r\n\r\n  WITH AN INTRODUCTION, NOTES, AND GLOSSARIAL INDEX,\r\n\r\n\r\n  BY\r\n\r\n  THE REV.

We know that his name was “Mayster\r\nFitzherbarde” (see p. 125), and the question that has to be settled\r\nis simply this--may we identify him with Sir Anthony Fitzherbert,\r\njudge of the Common Pleas, the author of the Grand Abridgment of\r\nthe Common Law, the New Natura Brevium, and other legal works?\r\n\r\nThe question has been frequently discussed, and, as far as I have\r\nbeen able to discover, the more usual verdict of the critics is in\r\nfavour of the supposed identity; and certainly all the evidence\r\ntends very strongly in that direction, as will, I think, presently\r\nappear.\r\n\r\nIndeed, when we come to investigate the grounds on which the\r\nobjections to the usually received theory rest, they appear to be\r\nexceedingly trivial; nor have I been very successful in discovering\r\nthe opposed arguments. Bohn’s edition of Lowndes’ Bibliographer’s\r\nManual merely tells us that “the treatises on Husbandry and\r\nSurveying are by some attributed to the famous lawyer Sir Anthony\r\nFitzherbert, by others to his brother John Fitzherbert.”\r\n\r\nIn the Catalogue of the Huth Library, we find this note: “The Rev.\r\nJoseph Hunter was the first person to point out that the author of\r\nthis work [Fitzherbert’s Husbandry] and the book on Surveying was\r\na different person from the judge of the same name.” It will be at\r\nonce observed that this note is practically worthless, from the\r\nabsence of the reference. After considerable search, I have been\r\nunable to discover where Hunter’s statement is to be found, so that\r\nthe nature of his objections can only be guessed at.\r\n\r\nIn Walter Harte’s Essays on Husbandry (ii. 77) we read--“How\r\nFitzherbert could be a practitioner of the art of agriculture for\r\n40 years, as he himself says in 1534, is pretty extraordinary. I\r\nsuppose it was his country amusement in the periodical recesses\r\nbetween the terms.” We are here presented with a definite\r\nobjection, grounded, as is alleged, upon the author’s own words;\r\nand it is most probable that Harte is here stating the objection\r\nwhich has weighed most strongly with those who (like Hunter) have\r\nobjected to the current opinion. The answer to the objection is, I\r\nthink, not a little remarkable, viz. that the alleged statement is\r\n_not_ the author’s at all. By turning to p. 125, it will be seen\r\nthat it was Thomas Berthelet the printer who said that the author\r\n“had exercysed husbandry, with greate experyence, xl. years.” But\r\nthe author’s _own_ statement, on p. 124, is _differently worded_;\r\nand the difference is material. He says: “and, as touchynge the\r\npoyntes of husbandry, and of other artycles conteyned in this\r\npresent boke, I wyll not saye that it is the beste waye and wyll\r\nserue beste in all places, but I saye it is the best way that euer\r\nI coude proue by experyence, the whiche haue _ben an housholder_\r\nthis xl. yeres and more, and haue assaied many and dyuers wayes,\r\nand done my dyligence to proue by experyence which shuld be the\r\nbeste waye.” The more we weigh these words, the more we see a\r\ndivergence between them and the construction which might readily\r\nbe put upon the words of Berthelet; a construction which, in all\r\nprobability, Berthelet did not specially intend. Any reader who\r\nhastily glances at Berthelet’s statement would probably deduce from\r\nit that the author was a farmer merely, who had had forty years’\r\nexperience in farming. But this is not what we should deduce from\r\nthe more careful statement of the author. We should rather notice\r\nthese points.\r\n\r\n1. The author does not speak of husbandry _only_, but of _other\r\npoints_. The other points are the breeding of horses (not a\r\nnecessary part of a farmer’s business), the selling of wood and\r\ntimber, grafting of trees, a long discourse upon prodigality,\r\nremarks upon gaming, a discussion of “what is riches,” and a\r\ntreatise upon practical religion, illustrated by Latin quotations\r\nfrom the fathers, and occupying no small portion of the work. This\r\nis not the work of a practical farmer, in the narrow acceptation\r\nof the term, meaning thereby one who farms to live; but it is\r\nclearly the work of a country gentleman, rich in horses and in\r\ntimber, acquainted with the extravagant mode of life often adopted\r\nby the wealthy, and at the same time given to scholarly pursuits\r\nand to learned and devout reading. Indeed, the prominence given to\r\nreligious teaching can hardly fail to surprise a reader who expects\r\nto find in the volume nothing more than hints upon practical\r\nagriculture. One chapter has a very suggestive heading, viz. “A\r\nlesson made in Englysshe verses, that _a gentylmans seruaunte_\r\nshall forget none of his gere _in his inne behynde hym_” (p. 7).\r\nThis is obviously the composition of a gentleman himself, and of\r\none accustomed to take long journeys upon horseback, and to stay at\r\nvarious inns on the way.[1]\r\n\r\n2. Again he says, “it is the best way that euer I coude proue by\r\nexperyence, the whiche ... haue assaied _many and dyuers_ wayes,\r\nand done my dyligence to proue by experyence which shuld be the\r\nbeste waye.” Certainly this is not the language of one who farmed\r\nfor profit, but of the _experimental_ farmer, the man who could\r\nafford to lose if things went wrong, one to whom farming was an\r\namusement and a recreation, and who delighted in trying various\r\nmodes that he might benefit those who, unlike himself, could not\r\nafford to try any way but that which had long been known.\r\n\r\n3. We must note the language in which he describes himself. He\r\ndoes not say that he had “exercised husbandry” for forty years,\r\nbut that he had “been a householder” during that period. The two\r\nthings are widely different. His knowledge of agriculture was, so\r\nto speak, accidental; his real employment had been to manage a\r\nhousehold, or, as we should rather now say, to “keep house.” This,\r\nagain, naturally assigns to him the status of a country gentleman,\r\nwho chose to superintend everything for himself, and to gain a\r\npractical acquaintance with everything upon his estate, viz. his\r\nlands, his cattle, his horses, his bees, his trees, his felled\r\ntimber, and the rest; not forgetting his duties as a man of rank\r\nin setting a good example, discouraging waste, giving attention\r\nto prayer and almsgiving, and to his necessary studies. “He that\r\ncan rede and vnderstande _latyne_, let hym take his booke in his\r\nhande, and looke stedfastely vppon the same thynge that he readeth\r\nand seeth, _that is no trouble to hym_,” etc. (p. 115). Are we to\r\nsuppose that it could be said generally, of farmers in the time of\r\nHenry VIII., that Latin was “no trouble to them”? If so, things\r\nmust have greatly changed.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of the above matter at some length, because I much\r\nsuspect that the words used by Berthelet are the very words which\r\nhave biassed, entirely in the wrong direction, the minds of such\r\ncritics as have found a difficulty where little exists. It ought to\r\nbe particularly borne in mind that Berthelet’s expression, though\r\nlikely to mislead _now_, was not calculated to do so at the time,\r\nwhen the authorship of the book was doubtless well known. And we\r\nshall see presently that Berthelet himself entirely believed Sir\r\nAnthony to have been the author of this Book on Husbandry.\r\n\r\nAnother objection that has been raised is founded upon the apparent\r\nstrangeness of the title “Mayster Fitz-herbarde” as applied to\r\na judge. The answer is most direct and explicit, viz. that the\r\nprinter who uses this title did so wittingly, for he is _the very\r\nman_ who helps us to identify our author with the great lawyer.\r\nIt is therefore simply impossible that he could have seen any\r\nincongruity in it, and any objection founded upon it must be\r\nwholly futile. The title of _master_ was used in those days very\r\ndifferently to what it is now. Foxe, in his Actes and Monuments,\r\ned. 1583, p. 1770, tells us how “maister Latymer” encouraged\r\n“maister Ridley,” when both were at the stake; and, chancing to\r\nopen Holinshed’s History (ed. 1808, iii. 754), I find a discourse\r\nbetween Wolsey and Sir William Kingston, Constable of the Tower, in\r\nwhich the latter is called “master Kingston” throughout.\r\n\r\nI cannot find that there is any reason for assigning the\r\ncomposition of the Book of Husbandry to John Fitzherbert, Sir\r\nAnthony’s brother. It is a mere guess, founded only upon the\r\nknowledge that Sir Anthony had such a brother. It looks as though\r\nthe critics who wish to deprive Sir Anthony of the honour of the\r\nauthorship think they must concede somewhat, and therefore suggest\r\nhis brother’s name by way of compensation.\r\n\r\nWe have no proof that John Fitzherbert ever wrote anything, whilst\r\nSir Anthony was a well-known author. All experience shows that a\r\nman who writes one book is likely to write another.\r\n\r\nWhen we leave these vague surmises and come to consider the direct\r\nevidence, nearly all difficulties cease. And first, as to external\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\nThe author of the Book of Husbandry was also author of the Book of\r\nSurveying, as has always been seen and acknowledged.[2] The first\r\npiece of distinct evidence on the subject is the statement of\r\nThomas Berthelet. He prefixed some verses to Pynson’s edition of\r\nthe Book of Surveying (1523), addressing the reader as follows:\r\n\r\n       “This worthy man / nobly hath done his payne\r\n        I meane hym / that these sayde bokes[3] dyd deuyse.\r\n        He sheweth to husbandes / in right fruteful wyse\r\n        The manyfolde good thynges / in brefe sentence\r\n        Whiche he hath well proued / by long experyence.\r\n      ¶ And this[4] I leaue hym / in his good wyll and mynde\r\n        That he beareth / vnto the publyke weale.\r\n        Wolde god _noblemen_ / coude in their hertes fynde\r\n        _After such forme_ / _for the cōmons helth_ to deale;\r\n        It is a true token / _of hyghe loue and zeale_\r\n        Whan _he_ so delyteth / and taketh pleasure\r\n        By his busy labour / _mens welth to procure_.”\r\n\r\nThis cannot well be mistaken. It is obvious that Berthelet believed\r\nthe author to be a _nobleman_, one who “shewed things to husbands”\r\nwhich he had gained by his own “long experience;” one who wrote\r\nout of the “good will and mind that he bare unto the public weal,”\r\nthereby proving his “high love and zeal,” in that he delighted\r\n“to procure men’s wealth,” _i.e._ the welfare of others, not his\r\nown riches, by means of his “busy labour.” We hence conclude that\r\nBerthelet knew perfectly well who the author was; and indeed it\r\nwould have been strange if he did not, since he was writing in 1523\r\n(while the author was still alive), and subsequently printed both\r\nthe books of which he is here speaking. He plainly tells us that\r\nthe author was a nobleman, and merely wrote to benefit others out\r\nof pure love and zeal.\r\n\r\nBut this is not Berthelet’s only allusion to these books. In\r\nan edition of the Book of Surveying, printed by Berthelet,[5]\r\nthere are some remarks by him at the back of the title-page to\r\nthe following effect. “To the reder. Whan I had printed the\r\nboke longyng to a Justice of the peace, togither with other\r\nsmall bokes very necessary, I bethought me vpon this boke of\r\nSurueyenge, compyled sometyme by master Fitzherbarde, how good\r\nand howe profitable it is for all states, that be lordes and\r\npossessioners of landes, ... or tenauntes of the same, ... also\r\nhow well it agreeth with the argume_n_t of the other small bokes,\r\nas court-baron, court-hundred, and chartuary, I went in hande and\r\nprinted it in the same volume that the other be, to binde them\r\nal-togither. And haue amended it in many places.”\r\n\r\nThe mention of “the boke longyng to a Justice of the peace” is\r\ninteresting, as bringing us back again to Sir Anthony Fitzherbert.\r\n“In 1538,” says Mr. Wallis,[6] Robert Redman printed “The newe Boke\r\nof Justices of the Peas, by A. F. K. [Anthony Fitzherbert, Knight],\r\nlately translated out of French into English, In the yere of our\r\nLord God, M.D.xxxviii. The 29 day of December, Cum priuilegio.”[7]\r\nMr. Hobson’s list (Hist. Ashborne, p. 234) mentions this as “the\r\nfirst work on the subject ever printed,” but this is not the case.\r\nWynkyn de Worde and Copland both printed, as early as 1515, “The\r\nBoke of Justices of the Peas, the charge, with al the proces of\r\nthe Cessyons, Warrants, Superseders, wyth al that longyth to ony\r\njustice, &c.” It is not pretended that this was our author’s work;\r\nbut he improved upon it, as he did also upon the Natura Brevium.\r\nIn his preface to La Novel Natura Brevium (Berthelet, 1534), he\r\nsays that the original book was written by a learned man, whom he\r\ndoes not name: and that it was esteemed as a fundamental book for\r\nunderstanding the law. In the course of its translations, and of\r\nthe alteration of the laws, many things had been retained which\r\nwere unnecessary, and much desirable matter was omitted. This was\r\nwhat induced him to compose the new one.\r\n\r\nUpon this I have to remark, that it is incredible that Berthelet\r\nshould mention a work which he knew to be by Sir Anthony\r\nFitzherbert in one line, and in the next should proceed to speak\r\nof “Master Fitzherbarde” without a word of warning that he was\r\nspeaking of a different person. The obvious inference is that\r\nthe author of the Book on Surveying was, in his belief, the same\r\nperson as the “A. F. K.” who wrote “the boke longyng to a Justice\r\nof the peace.” As it is, he takes no trouble about the matter; for\r\nhe could hardly foresee that any difficulty would thence arise.\r\nIt is remarkable how frequently writers just stop short of being\r\nexplicit, because they think that, at the moment of writing, a fact\r\nis too notorious to be worth mentioning.\r\n\r\nHere the direct external evidence ceases. We now come to consider\r\nthe internal evidence, which is interesting enough.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the author of the Book of Husbandry was also\r\nthe author of the Book of Surveying, as he tells us explicitly in\r\nhis prologue to the latter book. But whoever wrote the Book of\r\nSurveying must have been a considerable lawyer. It is of a far\r\nmore learned and technical character than the Book on Husbandry,\r\nand abounds with quotations from Latin statutes, which the author\r\ntranslates and explains. In Chap. 1 he says of a certain statute,\r\nthat, _in his opinion_, it was made soon after the Battle of\r\nEvesham, in the time of Henry III.; and he frequently interprets\r\nstatutes with the air of one whose opinion was worth having. In\r\nChap, xi., he enlarges upon the mistakes made by lords, knights,\r\nsquires, and gentlemen who know but little of the law. “They come\r\nto the court or sende their clerkes, that can [know] as litle law\r\nas their maister or lasse, but that he vnderstandeth a lytell\r\nlatyn.” At the end of the same chapter, he is deep in law-terms,\r\ncourt-roll, fee simple, fee tayle, franke tenement, and all the\r\nrest of it. He then gives numerous forms, all in Latin, to be used\r\nby owners who wish to lease, grant, or surrender lands; but only\r\na good lawyer would venture to recommend forms suitable for such\r\nimportant purposes.\r\n\r\nSome other points of internal evidence have already been\r\nincidentally noticed, such as the author’s familiarity with the\r\nmode of life of the rich; his lesson made for “a gentylmans\r\nseruaunte”; his readiness to try many ways of farming as an\r\nexperimentalist who could afford to lose money; and his statement\r\nthat Latin was no trouble to him. I proceed to notice a few more.\r\n\r\nSomething further can be inferred from the author’s mention of\r\nplaces. He speaks of so many counties, as Cornwall, Devon, Essex,\r\nKent, Somerset, Buckinghamshire, Yorkshire, and Lancashire, that\r\nwe can at first obtain no definite result. But there is an express\r\nallusion to “the peeke countreye” at p. 44; whilst at p. 81 he\r\nalludes to the parts about London by using the adverb “there,” as\r\nif it were _not_ his home. Yet that he was perfectly familiar with\r\nLondon is obvious from his allusions to it in chap. xix. of the\r\nBook on Surveying. But there are two more explicit references which\r\nare worth notice. At p. 27, he speaks of “the _farther syde_ of\r\nDarbyshyre, called Scaresdale, Halomshyre, and so _northewarde_\r\ntowarde Yorke and Ryppon.” Now Scarsdale is one of the six\r\n“hundreds” of Derbyshire, and includes the country about Dronfield\r\nand Chesterfield; whilst Hallamshire is a name given to a part of\r\nYorkshire lying round and including Sheffield. We hence fairly\r\ndeduce the inference that the author lived on the _western side of\r\nDerbyshire_, in the neighbourhood of Ashborne, so that he looked\r\nupon Chesterfield as lying on the _farther_ side of the country,\r\nand at the same time _northward_, which is precisely the fact. We\r\nare thus led to locate the author in the very neighbourhood of Sir\r\nAnthony Fitzherbert’s home.\r\n\r\nAgain, at p. 65, he says that if he were to say too much about\r\nthe faults of horses, he would break the promise that he made “at\r\nGrombalde brydge,” the first time that he went to Ripon to buy\r\ncolts. After some search as to the place here intended, I found, in\r\nAllen’s History of Yorkshire, that one of the bridges over the Nidd\r\nnear Knaresborough is called “Grimbald bridge;”[8] and, seeing that\r\nKnaresborough is exactly due south of Ripon, it follows that the\r\nauthor came from the south of Knaresborough. We seem, in fact, to\r\ntrace the general direction of his first ride to Ripon, viz. from\r\nhis home to the farther side of Derbyshire, through the northwest\r\ncorner of Scarsdale to Sheffield, and “so northward” through Leeds\r\nand Knaresborough. Nothing can be more satisfactory.\r\n\r\nA very interesting point is the author’s love of farming and of\r\nhorses. As to horses, he tells us how he first went to Ripon to\r\nbuy colts (p. 65); how many secrets of horse-dealing he could\r\ntell; how, in buying horses, he had been beguiled a hundred times\r\nand more (p. 63); how he used to say to his customers that, if\r\never they ventured to trust any horse-dealer, they had better\r\ntrust himself (p. 73); and how he had in his possession at one\r\ntime as many as sixty mares, and five or six horses (p. 60). In\r\nthis connection, it becomes interesting to inquire if Sir Anthony\r\nFitzherbert was fond of horses likewise.\r\n\r\nIt so happens that this question can certainly be answered in the\r\naffirmative; and I have here to acknowledge, with pleasure and\r\ngratitude, the assistance which I have received from one of the\r\nfamily,[9] the Rev. Reginald Fitzherbert, of Somersal Herbert,\r\nDerbyshire. He has been at the trouble of transcribing Sir\r\nAnthony’s will, a complete copy of which he contributed to “The\r\nReliquary,” No. 84, vol. xxi. April, 1881, p. 234. I here insert,\r\nby his kind permission, his remarks upon the subject, together with\r\nsuch extracts from the will as seem most material for our present\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n“The following will of Sir Anthony Fitzherbert, of Norbury, is\r\ntranscribed from the Office Copy at Somerset House (Dingley, fol.\r\n20), and is now printed, as I believe, for the first time. The\r\ncontractions have been written out _in extenso_.\r\n\r\n“Sir Anthony married, secondly, the co-heir of Richard Cotton, and\r\nwith her he acquired the estate of Hampstall Ridware, which he\r\nprobably kept in his own hands, and farmed himself. He succeeded\r\nhis brother John at Norbury in 1531, and died there in 1538, aged\r\n68.\r\n\r\n“Fuller, in his _Worthies_, says that Sir Anthony Fitzherbert’s\r\nbooks are ‘monuments which will longer continue his Memory than\r\nthe flat blew marble stone in Norbury Church under which he lieth\r\ninterred.’ Camden (Gibson’s ed. 1753, vol. i. p. 271) calls him\r\n_Chief Justice_ of the Common Pleas; but Thoroton (Notts., ed.\r\n1677, p. 344) says, ‘I do not find that Anthony Fitzherbert was\r\never Chief Justice;’ and it does not appear that he was more than,\r\nas he describes himself, ‘oon of the kings Justices.’”\r\n\r\n\r\n  EXTRACTS FROM TESTAMENTUM ANTHONII FITZHERBERT.\r\n\r\n  “In nomine patris et filii et spiritus sancti Amen.”\r\n\r\n  “I Anthony ffitzherbert oon of the kings Justices being hole in\r\n  body and of parfite remembraunce thankes to almighty god make my\r\n  last will and testament the xii day of October in the xxix^{th}\r\n  yere of the Reign of king Henry the eight[10] in fourme folowing\r\n  ffirst I bequeth my soule to almighty god my saviour criste my\r\n  Redemer and to our blissed Lady his mother and to Mighel my\r\n  patron and to all the holy company of hevyn....\r\n\r\n  And I bequethe XLs to amende the high wayes[11] bitwixt Abbottes\r\n  Bromley [and] Vttaxather.

Written the day and yere\r\n  abouesaid.”\r\n\r\nThe will was proved at Lichfield, August 26, 1538.\r\n\r\nI may add that the will mentions his wife dame Maude, his son\r\nThomas, his three younger sons John, Richard, and William, and his\r\ndaughter Kateryn; also his cousin Richard Coton and his wife Alice.\r\nThomas Fitzherbert married the daughter of Sir Arthur Eyre.\r\n\r\nIt hence appears that Sir Anthony had no less than _three farms_,\r\none at Castleton in the Peak, one at Caldon in Staffordshire,\r\nnear Dove Dale, and a farm which he held of the King; besides the\r\nHow Grange and some land at Whittington near Lichfield, as also\r\nsome purchased lands and tenements in the counties of Stafford,\r\nNorthampton, and Warwick, mentioned in a part of the will which I\r\nhave not quoted. There was also the estate of Hampstall Ridware\r\nin Staffordshire, to which he attached considerable importance,\r\ndirecting his heir-looms to be kept there. He also makes mention,\r\nin all, of _six horses_ (including a stallion and two geldings),\r\n_twelve mares_, _three colts_, _one bull_, _four bullocks_, _five\r\nheifers_, _eight oxen_, and _ten cows_, though it is obvious that\r\nthese by no means include all his stock, but merely a selection\r\nfrom it. All this precisely agrees with the statements in the Book\r\nof Husbandry.\r\n\r\nI do not think it necessary to pursue the subject further, but\r\na word must be added as to the chronology. Not having seen the\r\nfirst edition of the Book of Husbandry printed by Pynson in 1523,\r\nI cannot certainly say whether the statement that the author had\r\n“been a householder for 40 years” occurs there. It occurs, however,\r\nin an undated edition by Peter Treuerys,[13] which is certainly\r\nthe _second_ edition, and printed between 1521 and 1531, as\r\nTreuerys is only known to have printed books during that period.\r\nNow this edition professes to have corrections and additions,\r\nthe title being--“Here bygynneth a newe tracte or treatis moost\r\np_ro_fytable for all husba_n_de men / and very [frutefu]ll for\r\nall other persones to rede / newly cor[rected] & amended by the\r\nauctour with to dyuerse other thynges added thervnto;” and it\r\nagrees very closely with the copy here printed. The date assigned\r\nfor Sir Anthony Fitzherbert’s birth is 1470. If we suppose him to\r\nhave begun housekeeping at 21, a period of 40 years will bring\r\nus to 1531, which is not inconsistent with his statement, if such\r\nbe the date of the copy above mentioned. If, however, it should\r\nappear that the statement exists even in the first edition printed\r\nin 1523, then the “forty years” would lead us to suppose that, if\r\nthe assigned date of his birth be correct, Sir Anthony began to be\r\na householder, in his own estimation, at the early age of twelve or\r\nthirteen. This is of course a difficulty, but not an insuperable\r\none, for the phrase “have been a householder” is somewhat vague,\r\nand the phrase “forty years or more” has rather the air of a\r\nrhetorical flourish.\r\n\r\nIt may here be noticed that Berthelet’s first edition (here\r\nreprinted) has nothing on the title-page but the words “THE BOKE OF\r\nHVSBANDRY,” with the date 1534 below. Later reprints which follow\r\nBerthelet have accordingly no statement as to the book being “newly\r\ncorrected and amended by the auctour,” etc.; whilst those which\r\nfollow Treuerys naturally copy it. This accounts for the fact that\r\nthe later editions are, to the best of my belief, all very much the\r\nsame, and that the claim to possess “corrections and amendments”\r\nmeans practically nothing, except with reference to the _first_\r\nedition only.\r\n\r\nOf Sir Anthony Fitzherbert, one of the best accounts seems to\r\nbe that given in the Biographia Britannica, 1750, vol. iii. p.\r\n1935, where Camden’s statement as to his being “Chief Justice” is\r\nrefuted. Briefly recapitulated, this account tells us that he was\r\nborn in 1470, and was the younger son of Ralph Fitzherbert, Esq.,\r\nof Norbury in Derbyshire; that he went to Oxford, and thence to\r\nthe Inns of Court; was made a serjeant-at-law, Nov. 18, 1511; was\r\nknighted in 1516; was made one of his majesty’s serjeants-at-law,\r\nand finally one of the Justices of the Court of Common Pleas in\r\n1523. He died May 27, 1538, and was buried at Norbury. “Two things\r\nare mentioned in reference to his conduct; first, that, without\r\nfear of his power, he openly opposed Cardinal Wolsey in the\r\nheighth of his favour; the other, that, when he came to lie upon\r\nhis death-bed, foreseeing the changes that were like to happen\r\nin the Church as well as State, he pressed his children in very\r\nstrong terms to promise him solemnly, neither to accept grants,\r\nnor to make purchases of abbey-lands; which it is said they did,\r\nand adhered constantly to that promise, though much to their\r\nown loss.” The authorities referred to are Pits, De Illustribus\r\nAngliæ Scriptoribus, p. 707; Wood, Athenæ Oxonienses, i. col.\r\n50; Fuller, Worthies, Derbyshire, p. 233; Tanner, Bibliotheca\r\nBritannico-Hibernica, p. 283; Chronica Juridicialia, pp. 153, 155.,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nThe number of editions of the Book of Husbandry is so large, and\r\nmany of these are nevertheless so scarce, that I do not suppose\r\nthe list here subjoined is exhaustive; nor have I much information\r\nabout some of them. I merely mention what I have found, with some\r\nauthorities.\r\n\r\n1. A newe tracte or treatyse moost profytable for all Husbandemen,\r\nand very frutefull for all other persons to rede. London: by\r\nRycharde Pynson. 4to. (1523). See Typographical Antiquities, by\r\nAmes and Herbert, ed. Dibdin, ii. 503. This is the _first_ edition,\r\nand very rare. It was described by Dibdin from Heber’s copy,\r\nsupposed to be unique. See Heber’s Catalogue, part ix. p. 61. The\r\nnote in Hazlitt that a copy of this edition is in the Bodleian\r\nLibrary is a mistake, as I have ascertained. It is not dated, but\r\nthe Book on Surveying, printed just afterwards, is dated 1523; and\r\nthere is no doubt as to the date. It is remarkable for an engraving\r\nupon the title-page, representing two oxen drawing a plough, with\r\ndrivers.\r\n\r\n2. “Here begynneth a newe tracte,” etc. (See p. xx.) London,\r\nSouthwark; by P. Treuerys, 4to. (No date; but between 1521 and\r\n1531). In the Camb. Univ. Library. This is the only other edition\r\nwhich (as far as I know) has the picture of ploughing upon the\r\ntitle-page.[14]\r\n\r\n3. By Thomas Berthelet, in 1532 (Lowndes). It is “12mo in size,\r\nbut in eights by signatures,” and therefore 8vo. (A. Wallis; Derby\r\nMercury, Nov. 1869).\r\n\r\n4. By Thomas Berthelet; 8vo.; the edition here reprinted from\r\nthe copy in the Cambridge University Library. There are also two\r\ncopies of it in the Bodleian Library at Oxford. The title-page has\r\nmerely the words: “THE | BOKE OF | HVS- | BANDRY;” printed within\r\na border bearing the date 1534. The reverse of the title-page\r\nis blank. On the second leaf, marked A ij, begins “The aucthors\r\nprologue.” The rest of sheet A (which contains in all only _six_\r\nleaves) is occupied with the Prologue and “the Table;” and is\r\nnot foliated. Then follow sheets B to M, all of _eight_ leaves,\r\nand sheet N, of _two_ leaves only. Sheets B to H have the folios\r\nnumbered from 1 to 56; sheets I, K, L have the folios numbered from\r\n51 to 75; and sheets M and N, from 81 to 90. Thus the six numbers\r\n51-56 occur twice over, and the five numbers 76-80 do not occur\r\nat all. It is not quite certain that the apparent date is also\r\nthe real one; for at the end of Berthelet’s print of Xenophon’s\r\ntreatise of Housholde, which has 1534 within the same border upon\r\nthe title-page, there is a colophon giving the date as 1537. This\r\nborder was evidently in use for at least three years. See Dibdin,\r\niii. 287.\r\n\r\n5. By Berthelet; 1546. This edition also contains the Treatise on\r\nSurveying. (Lowndes; compare Dibdin, iii. 348.)\r\n\r\n6. By Berthelet; 1548. (Lowndes; Dibdin, iii. 334, where it is\r\ndescribed as 12mo.) A copy of this is noticed in the Catalogue of\r\nthe Huth Library.\r\n\r\n7. By Thomas Marshe; (1560). This edition is said to be “newly\r\ncorrected and amended by the author, Fitzherbarde;” but is, of\r\ncourse, a mere reprint. See remarks upon this above. (Lowndes;\r\nDibdin, iv. 534.) In Arber’s Transcript of the Stationers’\r\nRegisters, i. 128, we find--“Recevyd of _Thomas Marshe_ for his\r\nlycense for pryntinge of a boke Called the boke of husbondry,\r\ngraunted the xx of June [1560] ... iiij. _d._” Hence the date,\r\nwhich is not given, may be inferred.\r\n\r\n8. By John Awdeley; 16mo. 1562; “wyth diuers addicions put\r\nther-vnto.” (Dibdin, iv. 566.)\r\n\r\n9. By John Awdeley; 8vo. 1576; “with diuers additions put\r\ntherunto.” (Dibdin, iv. 568.)\r\n\r\n10. Fitzharbert’s | BOOKE OF | Husbandrie. | DEVIDED Into foure\r\nseuerall Bookes, very ne | cessary and profitable for all sorts |\r\nof people. _And now newlie corrected, amended, and reduced into a\r\nmore pleasing forme of English then before.

Dedicated “To the Worshipfull\r\nMaister _Henrie Iackman Esquire_” ... by “Your Worships in\r\naffection I. R.” Of this book I shall say more below. I have used\r\nthe copy in the Douce Collection in the Bodleian Library.[15]\r\n\r\n11. etc. There are numerous other editions. Hazlitt mentions\r\none by R. Kele (no date), “newlye corrected and amended by the\r\nauctor Fitzherbarde, with dyuers additions put therunto.” Lowndes\r\nsays: “London, by Richard Kele, 16mo. There are two editions, one\r\ncontaining H, the other I, in eights.” Dibdin (iii. 533) mentions\r\none by John Wayland, 8vo. (no date), Lowndes mentions an edition\r\nprinted at London “in the Hovs of Tho. Berthelet,” 16mo.; eighty\r\nleaves; also--another edition, slightly differing in orthography,\r\nand having at the end “Cum privilegio;” also another “in the House\r\nof Thomas Berthelet,” 16mo. A, 6 leaves, B--M, in eights, N, 2\r\nleaves, with the date of 1534 on the title-page; but this can be\r\nnothing else than the very book here reprinted, and it is not clear\r\nwhy he mentions it again. Lowndes also notices undated editions by\r\nJohn Walley, Robert Toye, Jugge, and Myddylton.\r\n\r\nIt hence appears that the book was frequently reprinted between\r\n1523 and 1598, but the last of these editions was such as to\r\ndestroy its popularity, and I am not aware that it was ever again\r\nreprinted except in 1767, when the Books on Husbandry and Surveying\r\nwere reprinted together[16] in a form strongly resembling the\r\nedition of 1534.[17] The title of this book is--“Certain Ancient\r\nTracts concerning the management of Landed Property reprinted.\r\nLondon, printed for C. Bathurst and J. Newbery; 1767.” This is a\r\nfairly good reprint, with the old spelling carefully preserved; but\r\nhas neither note nor comment of any kind. A copy of it kindly lent\r\nme by Mr. Furnivall has proved very useful.\r\n\r\nThe editions of the Book on Surveying are almost as numerous as\r\nthose of the Book on Husbandry, though this was hardly to be\r\nexpected, considering its more learned and technical character.\r\nIt is not necessary to speak here particularly of Sir Anthony\r\nFitzherbert’s acknowledged works. The most important are the\r\nGrand Abridgment of the Common Law (1514, folio), Office of\r\nJustices of the Peace (1538), Diversity of Courts (1539), and the\r\nNew Natura Brevium, of which the ninth edition, with a commentary\r\nby Lord Hale, appeared in 1794. The first edition of the Grand\r\nAbridgment was printed by Pynson, who was also the printer of the\r\nfirst edition of the Book of Husbandry. The New Natura Brevium was\r\nprinted in 1534 by Berthelet, who reprinted the Book of Husbandry\r\nin the same year. In a bookseller’s catalogue, March, 1880, I\r\nchanced to see the following. “Early English Printing; Black\r\nLetter; Law Books in Latin and Norman-French (1543-51). Natura\r\nBrevium; newely and most trewely corrected with diverse additio_n_s\r\nof statutes bokes cases plees in abatements, etc.; London,\r\nWyllyam Powel, 1551.--Articuli ad Narrationes novas; London, W.\r\nPowel, 1547.--Diuersite de courtz et lour jurisdiccions, et alia\r\nnecessaria et utilia, London, W. Myddylton, 1543. The three works\r\nin 1 vol., sm. 8vo., old calf neat, quite perfect and very rare,\r\n21_s._”\r\n\r\nThe present volume contains a careful reprint of Berthelet’s\r\nedition of 1534, which is a fairly good one. I have collated it\r\nthroughout with the curious edition of 1598, which abounds with\r\n“corrections,” some of them no improvements, and with additional\r\narticles. It is a very curious book, and I have given all the\r\nmore interesting variations in the notes, with a description of\r\nthe additions. The author, who only gives his initials “I. R.”\r\n(by which initials I have been often obliged to quote him[18])\r\nhas the effrontery to tell us that he has reduced Fitzherbert’s\r\nwork “into a more pleasing forme of English then before;” and says\r\nthat he has “labored to purge the same fro_m_ the barbarisme of\r\nthe former times.” Again he addresses the reader, saying--“Gentle\r\nReader, being vrged by the consideration of the necessitie of this\r\nworke, and finding it almost cast into perpetuall obliuion, I haue\r\npurged it from the first forme of missounding termes to our daintie\r\neares.” This means, of course, that he has altered terms which he\r\ndid not understand, and occasionally turns sense into nonsense; yet\r\nhe seems to have taken considerable pains with his author, and his\r\nadditions are frequently to the point. Whether his discourses upon\r\nthe keeping of poultry (p. 145, note to sect. 144) were really due\r\nto his “owne experience in byrds and foules,” or whether he copied\r\nmuch of it from some of his predecessors, I have not been curious\r\nto discover. His references to Virgil, to the fable of Cynthia\r\nand Endymion, the Cinyphian goats, and the rest, are in the worst\r\npossible taste, and he was evidently far too staunch a Protestant\r\nto be able to accept all Fitzherbert’s religious views, though\r\nmodestly and unobtrusively introduced. After carefully reading his\r\nproduction, I infinitely prefer Fitzherbert’s “barbarisme” to I.\r\nR.’s pedantic mannerism, and I find the patronising tone of his\r\noccasionally stupid amendments to be almost insufferable; but he\r\nmay be forgiven for his zeal. The art of sinking in poetry has\r\nrarely been so well exemplified as in the verses which are printed\r\nat pp. 145 and 148.\r\n\r\nThe reader can best understand what I. R. conceives to be elegance\r\nof style by comparing the following extract with section 1 at p. 9.\r\n\r\n“_Chapter 2._ ¶ _By what a Husbandman cheefely liueth._\r\n\r\nThe most generall and _commonest experienst liuing_ that the\r\n_toyle-imbracing_ Husbandman liueth by, is either by plowing and\r\nsowing of his Corne, or by rearing and breeding of Cattell, and\r\nnot the one without the other, _because they be adjuncts, and may\r\nnot be disceuered_. Then sithens that the Plough is the first good\r\ninstrument, by which the Husband-men _rips from the Earths wombe\r\na well-pleasing liuing, I thinke_ it is most conuenient first to\r\nspeake of the _forme, fashion, and_ making therof.”\r\n\r\nThe words italicised (except in the title) are all his own.\r\n\r\nThe Glossarial Index, a very full one, was almost entirely\r\nprepared, in the first instance, by my eldest daughter, though I\r\nhave since added a few explanations in some cases, and have revised\r\nthe whole, at the same time verifying the references. As to the\r\nmeaning of a few terms, I am still uncertain.\r\n\r\nFitzherbert’s general style is plain, simple, and direct, and he\r\nevidently has the welfare of his reader at heart, to whom he offers\r\nkindly advice in a manner least calculated to give offence. He is\r\nin general grave and practical, but there are a few touches of\r\nquiet humour in his remarks upon horse-dealing. “Howe be it I saye\r\nto my customers, and those that bye any horses of me, and [_if_]\r\neuer they wil trust any hors-master or corser whyle they lyue,\r\ntruste me.” I would have trusted him implicitly.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties of his language arise almost entirely from the\r\npresence of numerous technical terms; and it is, indeed, this fact\r\nthat renders his book one of considerable philological interest,\r\nand adapts it for publication by the English Dialect Society. By\r\nway of a small contribution to English etymology, I beg leave to\r\ntake a single instance, and to consider what he has to tell us\r\nabout the word _peruse_.\r\n\r\nThe whole difficulty as to the etymology of this word arises\r\nfrom the change of sense; it is now used in such a way that\r\nthe derivation from _per-_ and _use_ is not obvious; nor does\r\nit commend itself to such as are unacquainted with historical\r\nmethod. For this reason, some etymologists, including Webster,\r\nhave imagined that it arose from _peruise_ = _pervise_ to see\r\nthoroughly, the _i_ being dropped, and the _u_ (really _v_) being\r\nmistaken for the vowel. This is one of those wholly unscrupulous\r\nfictions to which but too many incline, as if the cause of truth\r\ncould ever be helped forward by means of deliberate invention. But\r\nthere is no such word as _peruise_, nor any French _perviser_.\r\nFitzherbert is one of the earliest authorities for _peruse_, though\r\nit also occurs in Skelton, Philip Sparrow, l. 814. Investigation\r\nwill show that, at the commencement of the sixteenth century, there\r\nwas a fashion of using words compounded with _per-_, a number of\r\nwhich I have given in my Dictionary, s. v. _peruse_. The old sense\r\nwas ‘to use up, to go through thoroughly, to attend to one by one;’\r\nand the word was sometimes spelt with a _v_, because _vse_ (_use_)\r\nwas generally so spelt. Examples are:--\r\n\r\n“Let hym [i.e. the husbandman who wants to reckon the tithe of his\r\ncorn] goo to the ende of his lande, and begynne and tell [i.e.\r\ncount] .ix. sheues, and let hym caste out the .x. shefe in the\r\nname of god, and so to _pervse_ from lande to lande, tyll he have\r\ntrewely tythed all his corne;” sect. 30, l. 4.\r\n\r\n“And thus [let the shepherd] _peruse_ them all tyll he haue doone;”\r\nsect. 40, l. 23.\r\n\r\n“Than [let the surveyor who is surveying property go] to the second\r\nhowse on the same east side in lyke maner, and so to _peruse_\r\nfrom house to house tyll he come to St. Magnus churche;” Book of\r\nSurveying (1767), chap. xix.\r\n\r\n“Begyn to plowe a forowe in the middes of the side of the land, and\r\ncast it downe as yf thou shulde falowe it, and so _peruse_ both\r\nsydes tyl the rygge be cast down,” etc.; Book of Surveying (1767);\r\nchap. xxiv.\r\n\r\nThe special application to a book may be seen in Baret’s Alvearie:\r\n“To ouerlooke and _peruse_ a booke againe, _Retractare librum_.”\r\nAnd accordingly it need not surprise us that Levins, in 1570,\r\ntranslated _to peruse_ by _peruti_.\r\n\r\nThere is just one more suggestion which I venture to make, though\r\nI fear, like most conjectures which are made with respect to\r\nShakespeare, it is probably valueless. When King Lear appears, in\r\nAct iv. sc. 4--\r\n\r\n      “Crowned with rank fumiter and furrow-weeds,\r\n      With _hor-docks_, hemlock, nettles, cuckoo-flowers,\r\n      Darnel, and _all the idle weeds that grow\r\n      In our sustaining corn_”--\r\n\r\nI cannot help being reminded of Fitzherbert’s list of weeds in\r\nsect. 20 (p. 29), in which he includes _haudoddes_, _i.e._ corn\r\nblue-bottles, as is obvious from his description; see also Britten\r\nand Holland’s English Plant-names. It is certainly remarkable that\r\nthe _haudod_ is precisely one of “the idle weeds that grow in\r\ncorn,” and that its bright colour would be particularly attractive\r\nto the gatherer of a wild garland. We must not, however, overlook\r\nthe form _hardhake_, which Mr. Wright has found in a MS. herbal as\r\na name for the knapweed; see his note upon the passage. The two\r\nresults do not, however, greatly differ, and it is conceivable\r\nthat the same name could be applied at different times to _both_\r\nthese flowers, the latter being _Centaurea nigra_, and the former\r\n_Centaurea Cyanus_. We also find the term _hardewes_, occurring as\r\na name for the wild succory; see _Hawdod_ in the Glossarial Index,\r\np. 156. In any case, the proposal of Dr. Prior to explain _hordock_\r\nby the burdock (_Arctium lappa_), merely because he thinks the\r\nburs were sometimes entangled with flax, and so formed lumps in it\r\ncalled _hards_, is a wild guess that should be rejected. _Hards_\r\nare simply the coarse parts of flax, without any reference to\r\nburdocks whatever.\r\n\r\nThe wood-cut on the title-page is copied from the edition of 1598.\r\nThe longer handle of the plough is on the left. See the description\r\non p. 128.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] “And [I give] to euery of my seruentes that be used to Ryde\r\nwith me,” etc.; Sir A.

It should be observed that 1538 was the very\r\nyear of Sir Anthony Fitzherbert’s death, which took place on May 27.\r\n\r\n[7] In an edition printed by T. Petit in 1541, a copy of which is\r\nin the Cambridge University Library, the title is--“The Newe Booke\r\nof Justyces of Peas, made by Anthony Fitzherbard Judge, lately\r\ntra_n_slated out of Frenche into Englyshe, The yere of our Lord God\r\nMDXLI.”\r\n\r\n[8] Canon Simmons kindly tells me--“I find from the Ordnance Map\r\nthat Grimbald Bridge is the one over the Nidd below the town,\r\n_i.e._ a mile or a mile and a quarter from the town. There are two\r\ncrossing to the town. The upper one is on the Harrogate Road, a\r\nsecond ‘Low Bridge,’ and then the third, ‘Grimbald bridge’.”\r\n\r\n[9] It is the family tradition (which should go for something),\r\nthat the author of the Book of Husbandry was Sir Anthony\r\nFitzherbert, and no other.\r\n\r\n[10] The date is, therefore, October 12, 1537.--W.W.S.\r\n\r\n[11] See p. 81.--W.W.S.\r\n\r\n[12] See p. 93.--W.W.S.\r\n\r\n[13] This early edition, clearly the _second_, and using Pynson’s\r\nwoodcut, was kindly pointed out to me by Mr. Bradshaw. It is not\r\nnoticed in the usual books upon early printing, but a copy of\r\nit exists in the Cambridge University Library. The woodcut on\r\nthe title-page is (as I have just said) the same as that on the\r\ntitle-page of the first edition.\r\n\r\n[14] Probably printed in 1531, as it professes to be “amended, with\r\ndyuerse other thynges added thervnto;” for observe, that after this\r\ndate, editions follow in quick succession.\r\n\r\n[15] Mr. Wallis (see p. xiii, note 2) mentions also an undated\r\nedition, printed by _James Roberts_ for E. White.\r\n\r\n[16] The volume also contains a translation of Xenophon’s Treatise\r\nof Household (Λόγος οἰκονομικός), written by “Gentian Heruet.”\r\n\r\n[17] The colophon is the same. The Book on Surveying is dated 1539.\r\nThe copy in the Cambridge Univ. Library contains the Husbandry\r\n(1534); Surveying (1539); and Xenophon (1537); all bound together.\r\n\r\n[18] Possibly James Roberts; see p. xxiv, note 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nERRATA.\r\n\r\n\r\n  In the first side-note on p. 18, _for_ Beating _read_ Beeting.\r\n  See _Beate_ in the Glossary, p. 150.\r\n\r\n  P. 120, sect. 169, l. 36. For _a ut_ read _aut_.\r\n\r\n  P. 136. Headline. For _Notes_ (=34.= 1-=43=) read _Notes_ (=34.=\r\n  1-43).\r\n\r\n  P. 140, last line.

And as Job saythe, _Homo\r\n  nascitur ad laborem, sicut auis ad volandum_: That is\r\n  to saye, a man is ordeyned and borne to do labour, as                4\r\n  a bird is ordeyned to flye. And the Apostle saythe,\r\n  _Qui non laborat, non manducet: Debet enim in obsequio dei\r\n  laborare, qui de bonis eius vult manducare_: That is to saye,\r\n      [Sidenote: He that laboureth not should not eat.]\r\n  he that laboureth not, shulde not eate, and he ought to              8\r\n  labour and doo goddes warke, that wyll eate of his goodes\r\n  or gyftes. The whiche is an harde texte after the lyterall\r\n  sence. For by the letter, the kynge, the quene, nor all\r\n  other lordes spirituall and temporal shuld not eate, without        12\r\n  they shuld labour, the whiche were vncomely, and\r\n  not conuenyente for suche estates to labour.

The fote is one: the setting of the culture of            12\r\n  a depnes, is a-nother: and the thyrde is at the ploughe-tayle,\r\n      [Sidenote: Slot wedges.]\r\n  where be two wedges, that be called slote-wedges:\r\n  the one is in the slote above the beame, the other in\r\n  the saide slote, vnder the plough-beame; and other whyle          16\r\n  he wyll set bothe aboue, or bothe vndernethe, but alway\r\n  let hym take good hede, and kepe one generall rule, that\r\n  the hynder ende of the sharebeme alway touche the erthe,\r\n  that it may kyll a worde,[22] or elles it goth not truly. The     20\r\n      [Sidenote: Narrow and broad tempering.]\r\n  temperynge to go brode and narowe is in the settyng of\r\n  the culture: and with the dryuinge of his syde-wedges,\r\n  forewedge, and helewedge, whiche wolde be made of\r\n      [Sidenote: Setting on of the share.]\r\n  drye woode, and also the settynge on of his share helpeth         24\r\n  well, and is a connynge poynte of husbandry, and\r\n  mendeth and payreth moch plowyng: but it is so narowe\r\n  a point to know, that it is harde to make a man to vnderstande\r\n  it by wrytynge, without he were at the operation                  28\r\n      [Sidenote: [Fol. 4.]]\r\n  therof, to teache the practyue: for it muste leane moche\r\n  in-to the forowe, and the poynt may not stande to moch\r\n  vp nor downe, nor to moche in-to the lande, nor in-to\r\n      [Sidenote: Setting of the coulter.]\r\n  the forowe. Howe-be-it, the settynge of the culture               32\r\n  helpeth moche. Somme plowes haue a bende of yron\r\n  tryanglewise, sette there as the plough-eare shulde be,\r\n  that hath thre nyckes on the farther syde. And yf he\r\n      [Sidenote: Seed-furrow.]\r\n  wyll haue his plough to go a narowe forowe, as a sede-forowe      36\r\n  shulde be, than he setteth his fote-teame in the\r\n      [Sidenote: Mean furrow.]\r\n  nycke nexte to the ploughe-beame; and yf he wyll go\r\n  a meane bredth, he setteth it in the myddell nycke,\r\n      [Sidenote: Broad furrow.]\r\n  that is beste for sturrynge; and if he wolde go a brode           40\r\n  forowe, he setteth it in the vttermoste nycke, that is beste\r\n  for falowynge: The whyche is a good waye to kepe the\r\n  bredthe, and soone tempered, but it serueth not the\r\n  depenesse. And some men haue in stede of the plough-fote,         44\r\n  a piece of yron set vpryghte in the farther ende\r\n      [Sidenote: ‘A coke.’]\r\n  of the ploughe-beame, and they calle it a coke, made\r\n  with ii. or thre nyckes, and that serueth for depenes.\r\n      [Sidenote: Wheel-ploughs.]\r\n  The plowes that goo with wheles, haue a streyghte                 48\r\n  beame, and maye be tempred in the yron, as the other be,\r\n  for the bredth; but their most speciall temper is at the\r\n  bolster, where-as the plough-beame lyeth, and that\r\n  serueth both for depnes and for bredth. And they be               52\r\n      [Sidenote: [Fol. 4_b_.]]\r\n  good on euen grounde that lyeth lyghte, but me semeth\r\n  they be farre more costly than the other plowes. And\r\n  thoughe these plowes be well tempred for one maner\r\n  grounde, that tempre wyll not serue in an other maner             56\r\n  of grounde; but it muste reste in the dyscretion of the\r\n  housbande, to knowe whanne it gothe well.\r\n\r\n\r\n  5. ¶ The necessary thynges that belonge to a ploughe,\r\n  carte, and wayne.\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: Bows, yokes, &c.]\r\n  Bvt or he begyn to plowe, he muste haue his ploughe\r\n  and his ploughe-yren, his oxen or horses, and the geare\r\n  that belongeth to them; that is to say, bowes, yokes,\r\n  landes, stylkynges, wrethynge-temes. And or he shall               4\r\n  lode his corne, he muste haue a wayne, a copyoke, a\r\n  payre of sleues, a wayne-rope, and a pykforke. This\r\n      [Sidenote: The wain.]\r\n  wayne is made of dyuers peces, that wyll haue a greate\r\n  reparation, that is to saye, the wheles, and those be made         8\r\n  of nathes, spokes, fellyes, and dowles, and they muste\r\n  be well fettred with wood or yren. And if they be yren\r\n  bounden, they are moche the better, and thoughe they\r\n      [Sidenote: [Fol. 5.]]\r\n  be the derer at the fyrst, yet at lengthe they be better          12\r\n      [Sidenote: Iron-bound wheels.]\r\n  cheape; for a payre of wheles yren bounde wyl weare vii.\r\n  or viii. payre of other wheles, and they go rounde and\r\n  lyght after oxen or horses to draw. Howbeit on marreis\r\n  ground and soft ground the other wheles be better,                16\r\n  bycause they be broder on the soule, and will not go so\r\n      [Sidenote: Axle-tree, linch-pins, and axle-pins.]\r\n  depe. They must haue an axiltre, clout with .viii.\r\n  waincloutes of yren, ii. lyn-pinnes of yren in the axiltre-endes,\r\n  ii. axil-pynnes of yren or els of tough harde                     20\r\n  wodde. The bodye of the wayne of oke, the staues, the\r\n  nether rathes, the ouer rathes, the crosse somer, the keys\r\n  and pikstaues. And if he go with a hors-ploughe, than\r\n  muste he haue his horses or mares, or both his hombers or         24\r\n  collers, holmes whyted, tresses, swyngletrees, and togwith.\r\n      [Sidenote: The cart.]\r\n  Alsoo a carte made of asshe, bycause it is lyghte, and\r\n  lyke stuffe to it as is to a wayne, and also a cart-sadel,\r\n  bakbandes, and belybandes, and a carte-ladder behinde,            28\r\n  whan he shall carye eyther corne or kyddes, or suche\r\n      [Sidenote: Cart-ladders.]\r\n  other. And in many countreys theyr waynes haue carte-ladders\r\n  bothe behynde and before. Also an husbande\r\n      [Sidenote: Axe, hatchet, &c.]\r\n  muste haue an axe, a hachet, a hedgyngebyll, a pyn-awgur,         32\r\n  a rest-awgur, a flayle, a spade, and a shouell. And howe-be-it\r\n  that I gyue theym these names, as is most comonly\r\n      [Sidenote: [Fol. 5_b_.]]\r\n  vsed in my contrey, I knowe they haue other names in\r\n  other contreyes. But hereby a manne maye perceyue                 36\r\n      [Sidenote: Expense of husbandry.]\r\n  many thynges that belonge to husbandry, to theyr greate\r\n  costes and charges, for the mayntenance and vpholdyng\r\n  of the same. And many moo thynges are belongynge to\r\n  husbandes than these, as ye shall well perceyue, er I             40\r\n  haue made an ende of this treatyse. And if a yonge\r\n  husbande shulde bye all these thynges, it wolde be\r\n      [Sidenote: It is better to make than buy.]\r\n  costely for hym: wherfore it is necessarye for hym to\r\n  lerne to make his yokes, oxe-bowes, stooles, and all              44\r\n  maner of plough-geare.\r\n\r\n\r\n  6. ¶ Whether is better, a plough of horses or a plough of\r\n  oxen.\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: Ox-plough and horse-plough.]\r\n  It is to be knowen, whether is better, a plough of\r\n  horses, or a plough of oxen, and therin me semeth\r\n  oughte to be made a distinction. For in some places an\r\n  oxe-ploughe is better than a horse-plough, and in somme            4\r\n  places a horse-ploughe is better: that is to say, in euery\r\n  place where-as the husband hath seueral pastures to put\r\n  his oxen in whan they come fro theyr warke, there the oxe-ploughe\r\n      [Sidenote: The ox.]\r\n  is better. For an oxe maye nat endure his                          8\r\n      [Sidenote: [Fol. 6.]]\r\n  warke, to labour all daye, and than to be put to the\r\n  commons, or before the herdman, and to be set in a folde\r\n  all nyghte without meate, and go to his labour in\r\n  the mornynge. But and he be put in a good pasture all             12\r\n  nyghte, he wyll labour moche of all the daye dayely.\r\n\r\n  And oxen wyl plowe in tough cley, and vpon hylly\r\n  grounde, where-as horses wyll stande st[i]ll. And where-as\r\n      [Sidenote: The horse.]\r\n  is noo seuerall pastures, there the horse-plowe is better,        16\r\n  for the horses may be teddered or tyed vpon leys, balkes,\r\n  or hades, where as oxen maye not be kept: and it is not\r\n  vsed to tedder them, but in fewe places.\r\n\r\n  And horses wyl goo faster than oxen on euen grounde               20\r\n  or lyght grounde, & be quicker for cariage: but they be\r\n  ferre more costly to kepe in winter, for they must haue both\r\n  hey and corne to eate, and strawe for lytter; they must\r\n  be well shodde on all foure fete, and the gere that they          24\r\n  shal drawe with is more costely than for the oxen, and\r\n      [Sidenote: Oxen are cheap,]\r\n  shorter whyle it wyll last. And oxen wyll eate but straw,\r\n  and a lyttell hey, the whiche is not halfe the coste that\r\n  horsis must haue, and they haue no shoes, as horses haue.         28\r\n  And if any sorance come to the horse, or [he] waxe olde,\r\n  broysed, or blynde, than he is lyttell worthe. And if any\r\n  sorance come to an oxe, [and he] waxe olde, broysed, or\r\n      [Sidenote: [Fol. 6_b_.]]\r\n  blinde, for ii._s._ he maye be fedde, and thanne he is mannes     32\r\n      [Sidenote: and they can be eaten.]\r\n  meate, and as good or better than euer he was. And the\r\n  horse, whan he dyethe, is but caryen. And therfore me\r\n  semeth, all thynges consydered, the ploughe of oxen is\r\n  moche more profytable than the ploughe of horses.                 36\r\n\r\n\r\n  7. ¶ The dylygence and attendaunce that a husbande shulde\r\n  gyue to his warke, in maner of an other prologue, and\r\n  the speciall grounde of all this treatyse.\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: Take pains, keep measure, and be rich.]\r\n  Thou husbande, that intendeste to gette thy lyuynge\r\n  by husbandry, take hede to the sayenge of the wyse\r\n  phylosopher, the which sayth, _Adhibe curam, tene mensuram,\r\n  et eris diues_. That is to saye, Take hede to thy charge,          4\r\n  kepe measure, and thou shalt be ryche. And nowe to\r\n  speke of the fyrste artycle of these .iii. s[cilicet] _Adhibe\r\n  curam_. He that wyll take vpon hym to do any thinge,\r\n  and be slouthefull, recheles, and not diligent to execute          8\r\n  and to performe that thynge that he taketh vpon hym,\r\n  he shall neuer thryue by his occupation. And to the\r\n  same entente saythe our lorde in his gospell, by a parable.\r\n      [Sidenote: [Fol. 7.]]\r\n  _Nemo mittens manum suam ad aratrum respiciens retro, aptus       12\r\n      [Sidenote: Luke ix. 62.]\r\n  est regno dei._ The spirytuall constructyon of this texte, I\r\n  remytte to the doctours of dyuynitie, and to the greate\r\n  clarkes; but to reduce and brynge the same texte to my\r\n      [Sidenote: No man, putting his hand to the plough, &c.]\r\n  purpose, I take it thus. There is noo man, puttynge his           16\r\n  hande to the plough, lokyng backewarde, is worthy to\r\n  haue that thynge that he oughte to haue. For if he\r\n  goo to the ploughe, and loke backewarde, he seeth not\r\n  whether the plough go in rydge or rayne, make a balke,            20\r\n  or go ouerthwarte. And if it do so, there wyll be lyttell\r\n      [Sidenote: Be not idle.]\r\n  corne. And so if a man attende not his husbandrye, but\r\n  goo to sporte or playe, tauerne or ale-house, or slepynge\r\n  at home, and suche other ydle warkes, he is not than              24\r\n      [Sidenote: Do what you came to do.]\r\n  worthy to haue any corne. And therfore, _Fac quod venisti_,\r\n  Do that thou comest fore, and thou shalte fynde that thou\r\n  sekest fore, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n  8. ¶ Howe a man shulde plowe all maner of landes all tymes\r\n  of the yere.\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: Times of the year.]\r\n  Nowe these plowes be made and tempered, it is to\r\n  be knowen howe a man shoulde plowe all tymes of\r\n  the yere. In the begynnynge of the yere, after the\r\n      [Sidenote: [Fol. 7_b_.]]\r\n  feast of the Epiphany, it is tyme for a husbande to                4\r\n      [Sidenote: Plough leas early.]\r\n  go to the ploughe. And if thou haue any leys, to\r\n  falowe or to sowe otes vpon, fyrste plowe them, that\r\n  the grasse and the mosse may rotte, and plowe them\r\n  a depe square forowe. And in all maner of plowynge,                8\r\n  se that thy eye, thy hande, and thy fote do agree,\r\n  and be alwaye redy one to serue a-nother, and to turne\r\n      [Sidenote: Lay the mould flat.]\r\n  vp moche molde, and to lay it flat, that it rere not\r\n  on edge. For if it rere on edge, the grasse and mosse             12\r\n  wyll not rotte. And if thou sowe it with winter-corne,\r\n  as whete or ry, as moche corne as toucheth the mosse\r\n  wyll be drowned, the mosse dothe kepe such wete in\r\n  it self. And in some countreys, if a man plowe depe,              16\r\n  he shall passe the good grounde, and haue but lyttel\r\n  corne: but that countrey is not for men to kepe husbandry\r\n  vppon, but for to rere and brede catell or shepe, for\r\n      [Sidenote: Beeting land with mattocks.]\r\n  elles they muste go beate theyr landes with mattockes,            20\r\n  as they do in many places of Cornewayle, and in som\r\n  places of Deuonshyre.\r\n\r\n\r\n  9. ¶ To plowe for pease and beanes.\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: Peas and beans.]\r\n  Howe to plowe for pees and beanes, were necessarye\r\n  to knowe. Fyrst thou muste remember, whiche is\r\n      [Sidenote: [Fol. 8.]]\r\n  mooste cley-grounde, and that plowe fyrste, and lette\r\n  it lye a good space, er thou sowe it: bycause the                  4\r\n  froste, the rayne, the wynde, and the sonne may cause\r\n  it to breake smalle, to make moche molde, and to\r\n      [Sidenote: Plough a square furrow.]\r\n  rygge it. And to plow a square forowe, the bredthe\r\n  and the depenes all one, and to laye it close to his               8\r\n  felow. For the more forowes, the more corne, for a\r\n  generall rule of all maner of cornes. And that may\r\n  be proued at the comynge vp of all maner of corne,\r\n  to stande at the landes ende and loke toward the other            12\r\n  ende; And than may ye se, howe the corne groweth.\r\n\r\n\r\n  10. ==> Howe to sowe bothe pease and beanes.\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: Sowing of peas and beans.]\r\n  Thou shalt sowe thy peas vpon the cley-grounde,\r\n  and thy beanes vpon the barley-grounde: for they\r\n  wolde haue ranker grounde than pease. How-be-it\r\n  some husbandes holde opynion, that bigge and styffe                4\r\n  grounde, as cley, wolde be sowen with bigge stuffe,\r\n  as beanes; but me thynke the contrary. For if a dry\r\n  sommer come, his beanes wil be shorte. And if the\r\n  grounde be good, putte the more beanes to the pease,               8\r\n  and the better shall they yelde, whan they be thresshed.\r\n      [Sidenote: [Fol. 8_b_.]]\r\n  And if it be very ranke grounde, as is moche at euery\r\n  towne-syde, where catel doth resort, plowe not that\r\n  lande, tyll ye wyll sowe it; for if ye do, there wyll             12\r\n      [Sidenote: In rank ground sow beans.]\r\n  come vppe kedlokes and other wedes. And than sowe\r\n  it with beanes; for if ye sowe pees, the kedlokes wyll\r\n  hurte them; and wha_n_ ye se seasonable time, sow\r\n  both pees and beanes, so that they be sowen in the                16\r\n  begynnynge of Marche. Howe shall ye knowe seasonable\r\n      [Sidenote: If the land sing, it is too wet to sow.]\r\n  tyme? go vppon the lande, that is plowed, and if it\r\n  synge or crye, or make any noyse vnder thy fete, than\r\n  it is to wete to sowe: and if it make no noyse, and               20\r\n  wyll beare thy horses, thanne sowe in the name of god.\r\n      [Sidenote: How to sow peas.]\r\n  But howe to sowe? Put thy pees in-to thy hopper, and\r\n  take a brode thonge, of ledder, or of garthe-webbe of\r\n  an elle longe, and fasten it to bothe endes of the                24\r\n  hopper, and put it ouer thy heed, lyke a leysshe; and\r\n  stande in the myddes of the lande, where the sacke\r\n  lyethe, the whiche is mooste conueniente for the fyllynge\r\n  of thy hopper, and set thy lefte foote before, and take           28\r\n  an handefull of pees: and whan thou takeste vp thy\r\n  ryghte foote, than caste thy pees fro the all abrode; and\r\n  whan thy lefte fote ryseth, take an other handeful, and\r\n  whan the ryght fote ryseth, tha_n_ cast them fro the.             32\r\n      [Sidenote: [Fol. 9.]]\r\n  And so at euery ii. paces, thou shalte sowe an handful\r\n  of pees: and so se that the fote and the hande\r\n      [Sidenote: Cast them wide.]\r\n  agree, and than ye shal sowe euen. And in your\r\n  castynge, ye muste open as well your fyngers as your hande,       36\r\n  and the hyer and farther that ye caste your corne, the\r\n  better shall it sprede, excepte it be a greatte wynde.\r\n  And if the lande be verye good, and wyll breke small\r\n  in the plowynge, it is better to sowe after the ploughe           40\r\n  thanne tarye any lenger.\r\n\r\n\r\n  11. ¶ Sede of discretion.\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: Seed of Discretion.]\r\n  There is a sede, that is called Discretio_n_, and if\r\n  a husband haue of that sede, and myngle it amonge\r\n  his other cornes, they wyll growe moche the better;\r\n  for that sede wyll tell hym, how many castes of corne              4\r\n  euery lande ought to haue. And a yonge husbande, and\r\n  may fortune some olde husbande, hath not sufficyente\r\n      [Sidenote: Borrow discretion, if you have it not.]\r\n  of that sede: and he that lackethe, let hym borowe\r\n  of his neyghbours that haue. And his neyghbours                    8\r\n  be vnkynde, if they wyll not lende this yonge housbande\r\n  parte of this sede. For this sede of Discretion\r\n  hath a wonders property: for the more that it is taken\r\n  of or lente, the more it is. And therfore me semeth,              12\r\n      [Sidenote: [Fol. 9_b_.]]\r\n  it shoulde be more spyrituall than temporall, wherin\r\n      [Sidenote: Temporal things, when divided, wane.]\r\n  is a greate dyuersitie. For a temporall thynge, the\r\n  more it is deuyded, the lesse it is: and a spirytuall\r\n  thynge, the more it is deuided, the more it is. _Verbi            16\r\n  gratia._ For ensaumple, I put case a wyfe brynge a\r\n  lofe of breade to the churche, to make holy breade\r\n  of; whan it is cut in many smal peces, and holy\r\n  breade made therof, there may be so many men, women,              20\r\n  and children in the churche, that by that tyme the priest\r\n  hath delte to euery one of them a lyttell pece, there\r\n  shall neuer a crume be lefte in the hamper.

An acre of grounde, by the statute, that is to say         4\r\n  xvi. fote and a half to the perche or pole, foure perches\r\n  to an acre in bredth, and fortye perches to an acre in\r\n      [Sidenote: London bushels.]\r\n  lengthe, may be metelye well sowen with two London\r\n  busshelles of pease, the whyche is but two strykes in              8\r\n  other places. And if there be the .iiii. parte beanes, than\r\n  wylle it haue halfe a London bushelle more: and yf it be\r\n  halfe beanes, it wyll haue thre London bushels: and if it\r\n  be all beanes, it wyll haue foure London busshelles fullye,       12\r\n  and that is half a quarter; bycause the beanes be gret, and\r\n  grow vp streight, & do not sprede and go abrode as\r\n      [Sidenote: Beans worth more than peas.]\r\n  pease do. An acre of good beanes is worth an acre & a\r\n  half of good pees, bycause there wylle be more busshelles.        16\r\n  And the beste propertie that belongeth to a good\r\n  husband is, to sowe all maner of corne thycke ynough,\r\n  and specially beanes and barley. For commonly they be\r\n  sowen vpon ranke ground, and good grounde wylle haue              20\r\n  the burthen of corne or of wede. And as moche\r\n  plowynge and harowynge hath an acre of grounde, and\r\n      [Sidenote: [Fol. 10_b_.]]\r\n  sowe thervppon but oone busshelle, as yf he sowed .iiii.\r\n  busshelles.

In some\r\n  countreys they begyn to sowe pees soone after Christmasse:\r\n  and in some places they sowe bothe pees and                       32\r\n  beanes vnder forowe: and those of reson must be sowen\r\n      [Sidenote: Feb. 2.]\r\n  betyme. But moste generally, to begyn sone after Candelmasse\r\n  is good season, so that they be sowen ere the\r\n  begynnynge of Marche, or sone vpon. And specially let             36\r\n  them be sowen in the olde of the mone. For thopinion of\r\n  olde husbandes is, that they shoulde the better codde,\r\n  and the sooner be rype. But I speke not of hasty pees,\r\n  for they be sowen before Christmasse, &c.                         40\r\n\r\n\r\n  13. ¶ To sowe barley.\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: Barley.]\r\n  Every good housbande hath his barleye-falowe well\r\n  dounged, and lyenge rygged all the depe and colde of\r\n  wynter; the whiche ryggynge maketh the lande to be\r\n      [Sidenote: [Fol. 11.]]\r\n  drye, and the dongynge maketh it to be melowe and                  4\r\n  ranke.

And some yeres it maye so fortune,\r\n  that there cometh no seasonable wether before Marche,\r\n  to plowe his barley-erthe. And as soone as he hath                12\r\n  sowen his pees and beanes, than let hym caste his barley-erthe,\r\n  and shortly after rygge it agayne: soo that it be\r\n  sowen before Apryll. And if the yere-tyme be paste,\r\n  than sowe it vpon the castynge.                                   16\r\n\r\n  ¶ It is to be knowen that there be thre maner of barleys,\r\n  that is to say, sprot-barleye, longe-eare, and beare-barley,\r\n      [Sidenote: Sprot-barley.]\r\n  that some menne call bigge. Sprot-barley hath a flat\r\n  eare most comonly, thre quarters of an inche brode,               20\r\n  and thre inches long, and the cornes be very great\r\n      [Sidenote: Long-ear.]\r\n  and white, and it is the best barley. Long-eare hath\r\n  a flatte eare, halfe an inche brode, and foure inches\r\n  and more of length: but the corne is not so greate                24\r\n  nor soo whyte, and sooner it wyll turne and growe\r\n      [Sidenote: Bear-barley.]\r\n  to otes.

Blacke otes are as great as they be, but they\r\n  haue not so moche floure in them, for they haue a thycker\r\n  huske, and also they be not so good to make otemele.              12\r\n      [Sidenote: Rough oats.]\r\n  The roughe otes be the worste, and it quiteth not the\r\n  coste to sowe them: they be very lyghte, and haue longe\r\n  tayles, wherby they wyll hange eche one to other. All\r\n  these maner of otes weare the grounde very sore, and              16\r\n      [Sidenote: Observe how thick to sow.]\r\n  maketh it to beare quyche.

It is vsed in many countreys, the husbandes to             4\r\n      [Sidenote: The ox-harrow.]\r\n  haue an oxe-harowe, the whiche is made of sixe smal\r\n      [Sidenote: Harrow-bulls.]\r\n  peces of timbre, called harowe-bulles, made eyther of\r\n  asshe or oke; they be two yardes longe, and as moche as\r\n  the small of a mannes legge, and haue shotes[23] of wode           8\r\n  put through theym lyke lathes, and in euery bull are syxe\r\n  sharpe peces of yren called harowe-tyndes, set some-what\r\n  a-slope forwarde, and the formes[t] slote[24] must be bygger\r\n  than the other, bycause the fote-teame shall be fastened          12\r\n  to the same with a shakyll, or a withe to drawe by. This\r\n      [Sidenote: The horse-harrow.]\r\n  harrowe is good to breake the greatte clottes, and to make\r\n  moche molde, and than the horse-harowes to come after,\r\n  to make the clottes smaller, and to laye the grounde euen.        16\r\n  It is a greate labour and payne to the oxen, to goo to\r\n      [Sidenote: ‘The ox is never woe, Till he to the harrow go.’]\r\n  harowe: for they were better to goo to the plowe two\r\n  dayes, thanne to harowe one daye. It is an olde saying,\r\n  ‘The oxe is neuer wo, tyll he to the harowe goo.’ And             20\r\n  it is bycause it goeth by twytches, and not alwaye\r\n      [Sidenote: [Fol. 13.]]\r\n  after one draughte.

And if they beate the clot on\r\n  the syde, it wyll the better breake. And the clot wyll lye        48\r\n  lyghte, that the corne maye lyghtely come vp. And they\r\n      [Sidenote: Rolling the ground.]\r\n  vse to role theyr barley-grounde after a shoure of rayne,\r\n  to make the grounde euen to mowe, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n  16. ¶ To falowe.\r\n\r\n  Nowe these housbandes haue sowen theyr pees, beanes,\r\n  barley, and otes, and harowed them, it is the beste tyme,\r\n      [Sidenote: Fallow in April.]\r\n  to falowe, in the later ende of Marche and Apryll, for\r\n  whete, rye, and barley. And lette the husbande do the              4\r\n      [Sidenote: Plough broad and deep.]\r\n  beste he can, to plowe a brode forowe and a depe,\r\n  soo that he turne it cleane, and lay it flat, that it rere\r\n  not on the edge: the whiche shall destroy all the thistils\r\n  and wedes. For the deper and the broder that he gothe,             8\r\n  the more newe molde, and the greatter clottes shall he\r\n  haue, and the greatter clottes, the better wheate. For\r\n  the clottes kepe the wheate warme all wynter, and at\r\n  Marche they wyll melte and breake, and fal in manye               12\r\n  small peces, the whiche is a newe dongynge, and refresshynge\r\n      [Sidenote: [Fol. 14, _misprinted_ 16.]]\r\n  of the corne.

An other cause is, the rayne\r\n  shall beate the lande so flat, and bake it so hard to-gyther,\r\n  that if a drye Maye come, it wyll be to harde to stere in         24\r\n      [Sidenote: (3) the weeds will take deep root.]\r\n  the moneth of June. And the thyrde cause is, the wiedes\r\n  shall take suche roote, er sterynge-tyme comme, that they\r\n  wylle not be cleane tourned vndernethe, the whiche shal\r\n  be great hurte to the corne, whan it shall be sowen, and          28\r\n  specially in the weding-tyme of the same; and for any\r\n  other thynge, make a depe holowe forowe in the rydge of\r\n      [Sidenote: Do not rest-baulk.]\r\n  the lande, and loke wel, thou rest-balke it nat; for if\r\n  thou do, there wyll be many thystels: and than thou               32\r\n  shalte not make a cleane rydge at the fyrste sterynge,\r\n  and therfore it muste nedes be depe plowed, or elles\r\n  thou shalt nat tourne the wiedes cleane.\r\n\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: [Fol. 14_b_.]]\r\n  17. ¶ To cary out donge or mucke and to sprede it.\r\n\r\n  And in the later ende of Apryll, and the begynnynge of\r\n      [Sidenote: Carry out dung.]\r\n  Maye, is tyme to cary out his dounge or mucke, and\r\n  to lay it vppon his barley-grounde.

And this maner of foldynge\r\n  shall brede noo mathes nor scabbe, nor appeyre theym\r\n  of theyr flesshe, and shall be a greate sauegarde to the          32\r\n  shepe for rottynge: and in the mornynge put them out\r\n  of theyr pasture, and thou shalte not nede to bye any\r\n      [Sidenote: Use no hurdles.]\r\n  hurdels nor shepe-flekes; but howe ye shall salue them\r\n  or dresse them, ye shall vnderstande in the chaypter of           36\r\n  shepe after.\r\n\r\n\r\n  19. ¶ To cary wodde and other necessaryes.\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: In May carry wood.]\r\n  And in May, whan thou hast falowed thy grounde, and\r\n  set oute thy shepefolde, and caryed oute thy dounge or\r\n  mucke, if thou haue any wodde, cole, or tymbre to\r\n  cary, or suche other busynes, that muste nedes be doone,           4\r\n  with thy charte or wayne, than is it tyme to do it. For\r\n      [Sidenote: The days are then long.]\r\n  than the waye is lyke to be fayre and drye, and the days\r\n  longe, and that tyme the husbande hath leeste to doo in\r\n  husbandry. Perauenture I set one thynge to be done at              8\r\n  one tyme of the yere, and if the husbande shulde do it,\r\n  it shulde be a greatter losse to hym in an other thynge.\r\n  Wherefore it is moste conuenient to do that thynge fyrst,\r\n      [Sidenote: [Fol. 16_b_.]]\r\n  that is moste profytable to hym, and as soone as he               12\r\n  can, do the other labour.\r\n\r\n\r\n  20. ¶ To knowe dyuers maner of wedes.\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: In June weed the corn.]\r\n  In the later ende of Maye, and the begynnynge of\r\n  June, is tyme to wede thy corne. There be diuers maner\r\n  of wedes, as thistyls, kedlokes, dockes, cocledrake,\r\n  darnolde, gouldes, haudoddes, dogfenell, mathes, ter,              4\r\n  and dyuers other small wedes. But these be they that\r\n      [Sidenote: Thistles.]\r\n  greue mooste: The thistyll is an yll wede, roughe and\r\n  sharpe to handell, and freteth away the cornes nygh it,\r\n  and causeth the sherers or reapers not to shere cleane.            8\r\n      [Sidenote: Charlock.]\r\n  Kedlokes hath a leafe lyke rapes, and beareth a yelowe\r\n  floure, and is an yll wede, and groweth in al maner corne,\r\n  and hath small coddes, and groweth lyke mustard sede.\r\n      [Sidenote: Docks.]\r\n  Dockes have a brode lefe, and diuers high spyres, and             12\r\n      [Sidenote: Cockle.]\r\n  very small sede in the toppe. Cockole hath a longe small\r\n  lefe, and wyl beare fyue or vi. floures of purple colour, as\r\n  brode as a grote, and the sede is rounde and blacke, and\r\n  maye well be suffred in a breade-corne, but not in sede,          16\r\n      [Sidenote: ‘Drake.’]\r\n  for therin is moche floure. Drake is lyke vnto rye, till it\r\n      [Sidenote: [Fol. 17.]]\r\n  begynne to sede, and it hath many sedes lyke fenell-sedes,\r\n  and hangeth downewarde, and it maye wel be suffred in\r\n  breade, for there is moche floure in the sede: and it is an       20\r\n      [Sidenote: Darnel.]\r\n  opinion that it commeth of rye, &c. Dernolde groweth\r\n  vp streyght lyke an hye grasse, and hath longe sedes on\r\n  eyther syde the sterte, and there is moche floure in that\r\n  sede, and growethe moche amonge barley: and it is                 24\r\n      [Sidenote: Golds.]\r\n  sayde, that it cometh of small barley. Golds hath a shorte\r\n  iagged lefe, and groweth halfe a yarde hygh, and hath a\r\n  yelowe floure, as brode as a grote, and is an yll wede, and\r\n      [Sidenote: Hawdod.]\r\n  groweth commonlye in barleye and pees. Hawdod hath                28\r\n  a blewe floure, and a fewe lyttell leues, and hath .v. or syxe\r\n  braunches, floured in the toppe: and groweth comonly in\r\n      [Sidenote: Dog-fennel.]\r\n  rye vpon leane grounde, and dothe lyttel hurte. Dogge-fenell\r\n  and mathes is bothe one, and in the commynge vp                   32\r\n  is lyke fenell and beareth many white floures, with a\r\n  yelowe sede: and is the worste wede that is, excepte terre,\r\n  and it commeth moste commonly, whan great wete commeth\r\n      [Sidenote: Tares.]\r\n  shortly after the corne is sowen. Terre is the                    36\r\n  worste wede, and it neuer dothe appere tyll the moneth\r\n  of June, and specyallye whanne there is great wete in\r\n  that mone, or a lyttell before, and groweth mooste in rye,\r\n  and it groweth lyke fytches, but it is moche smaller, and         40\r\n      [Sidenote: [Fol. 17_b_.]]\r\n  it wyll growe as hyghe as the corne, and with the weyght\r\n  therof it pulleth the corne flatte to the erth, and freteth\r\n  the eares away; wherfore I haue seene housbandes mowe\r\n  downe the corne and it together: And also with sharp              44\r\n  hokes to repe it, as they doo pees, and made drye, and\r\n  than it wyll be good fodder.\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: Dee-nettles.]\r\n  There be other wedes not spoken of, as dee-nettylles,\r\n      [Sidenote: Dodder.]\r\n  dodder, and suche other, that doo moche harme.                    48\r\n\r\n\r\n  21. ¶ Howe to wede corne.\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: How to weed.]\r\n  Nowe it wolde be knowen, howe these cornes shulde be\r\n  weded. The chyefe instrument to wede with is a paire\r\n  of tonges made of wode, and in the farther ende it is\r\n  nycked, to holde the wed faster; and after a shoure of             4\r\n  raine it is beste wedynge, for than they maye be pulled\r\n  vp by the rotes, and than it cometh neuer agayne. And\r\n      [Sidenote: Weeding-hook.]\r\n  if it be drye wether, than muste ye haue a wedynge-hoke\r\n  with a socket set vpon a lyttel staffe of a yarde longe, and       8\r\n  this hoke wolde be well steeled, and grounde sharpe bothe\r\n      [Sidenote: Forked stick.]\r\n  behynde and before. And in his other hande he hath a\r\n  forked stycke a yarde longe, and with his forked stycke\r\n      [Sidenote: [Fol. 18.]]\r\n  he putteth the wede from hym, and he putteth the hoke             12\r\n  beyond the rote of the wede, and pulleth it to hym, and\r\n  cutteth the wede fast by the erthe, and with his hoke he\r\n  taketh up the wede, and casteth it in the reane, and if\r\n  the reane be full of corne, it is better it stande styll,         16\r\n  whan it is cut, and wyddre: but let hym beware, that he\r\n  trede not to moche vppon the corne, and specyallye after\r\n      [Sidenote: Cut not the corn.]\r\n  it is shotte, and whan he cutteth the wede, that he cut\r\n  not the corne: and therefore the hoke wolde not passe             20\r\n  an inche wyde. And whanne the wede is soo shorte,\r\n  that he can not with his forked stycke put it from hym,\r\n  and with the hoke pull it to hym, thanne muste he set\r\n  his hoke vppon the wede, fast by the erthe, and put it            24\r\n  from hym, and so shall he cutte it cleane. And with\r\n      [Sidenote: Stoop not.]\r\n  these two instruments, he shall neuer stoupe to his warke.\r\n  Dogfenell, goldes, mathes, and kedlokes are yll to wede\r\n  after this maner, they growe vppon so many braunches,             28\r\n      [Sidenote: Pull up darnel.]\r\n  harde by the erthe: and therfore they vse most to pul\r\n  them vppe with theyr handes; but loke well, that they\r\n  pull not vppe the corne with all; but as for terre, there\r\n  wyll noo wedynge serue.                                           32\r\n\r\n\r\n  22. ¶ The fyrst sturrynge.\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: [Fol. 18_b_.]]\r\n  Also in June is tyme to rygge vppe the falowe, the\r\n  whiche is called the fyrst sturrynge, and to plowe it as\r\n  depe as thou canste, for to tourne the rotes of the wedes\r\n  vpwarde, that the sonne and the drye wether maye kyll              4\r\n  them. And an housbande can not conuenyentelye plowe\r\n      [Sidenote: How to plough and load out dung.]\r\n  his lande, and lode out his dounge bothe vppon a daye,\r\n  with one draughte of beastes: but he maye well lode oute\r\n  his dounge before none, and lode heye or corne at-after            8\r\n  none: or he maye plowe before none, and lode hey or\r\n  corne at-after none, with the same draughte, and noo\r\n  hurte to the cattell: bycause in lodynge of hey or corne,\r\n  the cattel is alwaye eatynge or beytynge, and soo they            12\r\n  can not doo in lodynge of dounge and plowynge.\r\n\r\n\r\n  23. ¶ To mowe grasse.\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: End of June.]\r\n  Also in the later ende of June is tyme to begyn to\r\n  mowe, if thy medowe be well growen: but howe-so-euer\r\n      [Sidenote: July.]\r\n  they be growen, in July they muste nedes mowe, for\r\n  diuers causes. One is, it is not conuenient to haue hey            4\r\n      [Sidenote: Mow hay early.]\r\n  and corne bothe in occupation at one tyme. An other is,\r\n  the yonger and the grener that the grasse is, the softer\r\n      [Sidenote: [Fol. 19.]]\r\n  and the sweter it wyll be, whan it is hey, but it wyll haue\r\n  the more wyddrynge; and the elder the grasse is, the               8\r\n  harder and dryer it is, and the worse for al maner of\r\n  cattell: for the sedes be fallen, the whiche is in maner\r\n  of prouander, and it is the harder to eate and chowe.\r\n  And an other cause is, if drye wether come, it wyll drye          12\r\n  and burne vpon the grounde, and waste away. Take\r\n      [Sidenote: How to mow.]\r\n  hede that thy mower mow clene and holde downe the\r\n  hynder hand of his sith, that he do not endent the grasse,\r\n  and to mowe his swathe cleane thorowe to that that                16\r\n  was laste mowen before, that he leaue not a mane bytwene,\r\n  and specyallye in the common medowe: for in\r\n  the seuerall medowe it maketh the lesse charge, and that\r\n      [Sidenote: Mole-hills.]\r\n  the moldywarpe-hilles be spredde, and the styckes cleane          20\r\n  pycked out of the medowe in Apryll, or in the beginnynge\r\n  of Maye.\r\n\r\n\r\n  24. ¶ Howe forkes and rakes shulde be made.\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: Forks and rakes.]\r\n  A Good husbande hath his forkes and rakes made\r\n  redye in the wynter before, and they wolde be gotte\r\n  bytwene Mighelmasse and Martylmasse, and beyked, and\r\n      [Sidenote: [Fol. 19_b_.]]\r\n  sette euen, to lye vpryght in thy hande: and than they             4\r\n  wyll be harde styffe and drye. And whan the housbande\r\n  sytteth by the fyre, and hath nothynge to do, than maye\r\n  he make theym redye, and tothe the rakes with drye wethy-wode,\r\n      [Sidenote: Bore holes for the teeth of the rakes.]\r\n  and bore the holes with his wymble, bothe aboue                    8\r\n  and vnder, and driue the tethe vpwarde faste and harde,\r\n  and than wedge them aboue with drye woode of oke, for\r\n  that is hard, and wil driue and neuer come out. And if\r\n  he get them in sappe-tyme, all the beykyng and drienge            12\r\n  that can be had shal not make them harde and styffe,\r\n      [Sidenote: Use hazel and withy.]\r\n  but they woll alwaye be plyenge: for they be moste\r\n  comonly made of hasell and withee, and these be the\r\n  trees that blome, and specially hasell: for it begynneth          16\r\n      [Sidenote: Use no green wood.]\r\n  to blome as sone as the lefe is fallen. And if the rake\r\n  be made of grene woode, the heed wyll not abyde\r\n  vppon the stele, and the tethe wyll fall out, whan he\r\n  hath mooste nede to them, and let his warke, and lose             20\r\n      [Sidenote: Make all evenly.]\r\n  moche heye. And se that thy rake and forke lye vpryghte\r\n  in thy hand, for and the one ende of thy rake, or the syde\r\n  of thy forke, hang downe-warde, than they be not handsome\r\n  nor easy to worke with.                                           24\r\n\r\n\r\n  25. ¶ To tedde and make hay.\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: [Fol. 20.]]\r\n  Whan thy medowes be mowed, they wolde be well\r\n      [Sidenote: Tedding hay.]\r\n  tedded and layde euen vppon the grounde: and if the\r\n  grasse be very thycke, it wolde be shaken with handes,\r\n      [Sidenote: Ted hay carefully.]\r\n  or with a shorte pykforke. For good teddynge is the                4\r\n  chiefe poynte to make good hey, and than shall it be\r\n  wyddred all in lyke, or elles not: and whan it is wel\r\n  wyddred on the ouer syde, and dry, than turne it cleane\r\n  before noone, as soone as the dewe is gone: And yf thou            8\r\n  dare truste the wether, lette it lye so all nyghte: and\r\n  on the nexte daye, tourne it agayne before none, and\r\n  towarde nyght make it in wyndrowes, and than in smal\r\n      [Sidenote: Hay-cocks.]\r\n  hey-cockes, and so to stande one nyghte at the leaste, and        12\r\n  sweate: and on the nexte fayre day caste it abrode\r\n  agayne, and tourne it ones or twyse, and than make it\r\n      [Sidenote: Larger hay-cocks.]\r\n  in greatter hey-cockes, and to stande so one nyght or\r\n  more, that it maye vngiue and sweate. For and it sweate           16\r\n  not in the hey-cockes, it wyll sweate in the mowe; and\r\n  than it wyll be dustye, and not holsome for hors, beastes,\r\n  nor shepe. And whan it standeth in the cockes, it is\r\n  better to lode, and the more hey maye be loded at a lode,         20\r\n      [Sidenote: Quich-hay.]\r\n  and the faster it wyll lye. Quyche-hey commeth of a\r\n  grasse called crofote, and groweth flatte, after the erthe,\r\n      [Sidenote: [Fol. 20_b_.]]\r\n  and bearethe a yelowe floure halfe a yarde hygh and\r\n  more, and hath many knottes towarde the roote, and it             24\r\n  is the beste hey for horses and beastes, and the sweteste,\r\n  if it be well got; but it wyll haue moch more wyddrynge\r\n  than other hey, for els he wyll be-pysse hym-selfe and\r\n      [Sidenote: How to know when hay is dry.]\r\n  waxe hote, and after dustye. And for to knowe whanne              28\r\n  it is wyddred ynoughe, make a lyttell rope of the same,\r\n  that ye thinke shulde be moste greneste, and twyne it as\r\n  harde to-gether bytwen your handes as ye canne, and soo\r\n      [Sidenote: Twist a wisp, and then cut it.]\r\n  beynge harde twon, let one take a knyfe, and cut it faste         32\r\n  by your hande; and the knottes wyll be moyste, yf it be\r\n  not drye ynough. Shorte hey, and leye-hey, is good for\r\n  shepe, and all maner of catell, if it be well got. A man\r\n  maye speke of makynge of hey, and gettynge of corne,              36\r\n  but god disposeth and ordreth all thynge.\r\n\r\n\r\n  26. ¶ Howe rye shulde be shorne.\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: In July, shear rye.]\r\n  In the later ende of July, or in the begynnynge of\r\n  Auguste, is tyme to shere Rye, the whiche wolde be\r\n  shorne cleane, and faste bounden. And in somme\r\n  places they mowe it, the whiche is not soo good to the             4\r\n  housbandes profytte, but it is the sooner done. For\r\n      [Sidenote: [Fol. 21.]]\r\n  whan it is mowen, it wyll not be so fast bounden: and\r\n  he can not gather it soo cleane, but there wyll be moche\r\n  losse, and taketh more rowme in the barne than shorne              8\r\n  corne dothe. And also it wyll not kepe nor saue it selfe\r\n  from rayne or yll wether, whan it standeth in the couer,\r\n  as the shorne corne wyll do.\r\n\r\n\r\n  27. ¶ Howe to shere wheate.\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: Shear wheat clean.]\r\n  Wheate wolde be shorne cleane, and harde bounden\r\n  in lyke maner; but for a generall rule, take good hede,\r\n  that the sherers of all maner of whyte corne cast not\r\n  vppe theyr handes hastely, for thanne all the lose corne,          4\r\n  and the strawes, that he holdeth not fast in his hande,\r\n  flieth ouer his heed, and are loste: and also it wyll pull\r\n  of the eares, and specyallye of the cornes that be verye\r\n      [Sidenote: Shear wheat clean.]\r\n  rype. In somme places they wyll shere theyr cornes                 8\r\n  hyghe, to the entente to mowe theyr stubble, eyther to\r\n  thacke or to bren: if they so do, they haue greate cause\r\n  to take good hede of the sherers. For if the eares of\r\n  corne croke downe to the erthe, and the sherer take               12\r\n  not good hede, and put up the eare er he cut the\r\n  strawe: as many eares as be vnder his hoke or sicle\r\n      [Sidenote: Fol. 21_b_.]\r\n  fall to the erthe, and be loste; and whan they mowe\r\n  the stubble, it is great hyndraunce to the profytte of            16\r\n      [Sidenote: Near Ilchester and Martock they shear low.]\r\n  the grounde. And in Sommersetshire, about Zelcestre\r\n  and Martok, they doo shere theyr wheate very lowe,\r\n  and all the wheate-strawe that they pourpose to make\r\n  thacke of, they do not thresshe it, but cutte of the              20\r\n  eares, and bynde it in sheues, and call it rede: and\r\n  therwith they thacke theyr houses. And if it be a\r\n      [Sidenote: Best kind of thatching.]\r\n  newe house, they thacke it vnder theyr fote: the\r\n  whiche is the beste and the surest thacking that can              24\r\n  be of strawe, for crowes and douues shall neuer hurte it.\r\n\r\n\r\n  28. ==> To mowe or shere barley and otes.\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: Mow barley and oats.]\r\n  Barley and otes be moste commonly mowen, and a\r\n  man or woman folowythe the mower with a hande-rake\r\n  halfe a yarde longe, with .vii. or .viii. tethe, in the\r\n  lyfte hande, and a syckle in the ryghte hande, and                 4\r\n  with the rake he gethereth as moche as wyll make a\r\n  shefe. And thanne he taketh the barley or otes by the\r\n  toppes, and pulleth out as moche as wil make a band,\r\n  and casteth the band from him on the land, and with his            8\r\n  rake and his syckle taketh vp the barley or otes, &\r\n      [Sidenote: [Fol. 22.]]\r\n  layeth them vppon the bande, and so the barley lyeth\r\n  vnbounden .iii. or .iiii. dayes, if it be fayre wether,\r\n  and than to bynde it. And whan the barley is ledde                12\r\n      [Sidenote: Rake afterwards.]\r\n  away, the landes muste be raked, or els there wyll be\r\n  moche corne loste, and if the barley or otes lye, they\r\n  muste nedes be shorne.\r\n\r\n\r\n  29. ¶ To repe or mowe pees and beanes.\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: Reap or mow peas and beans.]\r\n  Pees and benes be moste commonly laste reped or\r\n  mowen, of diuers maners, some with sickles, some\r\n  with hokes, and some with staffe-hokes.

And yf thou shalte           4\r\n  by oxen for the ploughe, se that they be yonge, and\r\n  not gowty, nor broken of heare, neyther of tayle, nor\r\n  of pysell. And yf thou bye kye to the payle, se that\r\n      [Sidenote: How to buy cows.]\r\n  they be yonge and good to mylke, and fede her calues               8\r\n  wel. And if thou bye kye or oxen to feede, the yonger\r\n  they be, the rather they wyll fede; but loke well, that\r\n  the heare stare not, and that he lycke hym-selfe, and\r\n  be hoole-mouthed, and want no tethe. And thoughe he               12\r\n  haue the goute and be broken, bothe of tayle and\r\n  pysell, yet wyll he fede. But the gouty oxe wyll not\r\n      [Sidenote: How to choose an ox.]\r\n  be dryuen ferre; and se that he haue a brode ryb, and\r\n  a thycke hyde, and to be lose-skinned, that it stycke not         16\r\n  harde nor streyte to his rybbes, for than he wyll not fede.\r\n\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: [Fol. 35.]]\r\n  57. ¶ To bye fatte cattell.\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: How to buy fat cattle.]\r\n  If thou shalte bye fatte oxen or kye, handel them,\r\n  and se that they be soft on the fore-croppe, behynde\r\n  the shulder, and vpon the hindermost rybbe, and upon\r\n  the hucbone, and the nache by the tayle. And se                    4\r\n  the oxe haue a greate codde, and the cowe great\r\n  nauyll, for than it shulde seme that they shuld be wel\r\n      [Sidenote: See where, and of whom, you buy.]\r\n  talowed. And take hede, where thou byeste any leane\r\n  cattel or fat, and of whom, and where it was bred. For             8\r\n  if thou by out of a better grou_n_d than thou haste thy-selfe,\r\n  that cattell wyll not lyke with the. And also\r\n  loke, that there be no maner of sycknes amonge the\r\n  cattell in that towneshyp or pasture that thou byest thy          12\r\n  catel oute of. For if there be any murren or longe\r\n  sought, it is great ieoperdy: for a beast maye take sycknes\r\n  ten or .xii. dayes or more, ere it appere on hym.\r\n\r\n\r\n  58. ¶ Dyuers sycnesses of cattell, and remedies\r\n  therfore, and fyrst of murren.\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: Murrain.]\r\n  And yf it fortune to fall murren amonge thy beastes,\r\n  as god forbede, there be men ynough can helpe them.\r\n      [Sidenote: [Fol. 35_b_.]]\r\n  And it commeth of a ranknes of bloudde, and appereth\r\n  moste commonly fyrste in the heed; for his heed wyll               4\r\n  swell, and his eyen waxe greate and ronne of water\r\n  and frothe at the mouthe, and than he is paste remedy,\r\n  and wyl dye shortely, and wyll neuer eate after he be\r\n      [Sidenote: Flay the dead beast, and bury it.]\r\n  sycke. Than flee him, and make a depe pytte faste by,              8\r\n  there as he dyeth, and caste hym in, and couer hym with\r\n  erthe, that noo dogges may come to the caryen. For as\r\n  many beastes as feleth the smelle of that caryen, are\r\n  lykely to be enfecte; and take the skynne, and haue it            12\r\n  to the tanners to sell, and bryng it not home, for peryll\r\n  that may fal. And it is commonly vsed, and cometh of\r\n      [Sidenote: Set the beast’s head, on a pole, in the hedge.]\r\n  a greate charytie, to take the bare heed of the same beaste\r\n  and put vpon a longe pole, and set it in a hedge, faste           16\r\n  bounden to a stake, by the hyghe-waye syde, that euerye\r\n  man, that rydethe or goeth that waye, maye se and knowe\r\n  by that signe, that there is sycknes of cattell in the towneshyp.\r\n  And the husbandes holde an opynyon, that it shall                 20\r\n  the rather cease. And whanne the beaste is flaine, there\r\n  as the murren dothe appere bytwene the flesshe and the\r\n  skynne, it wyll ryse vppe lyke a ielly and frothe an inche\r\n      [Sidenote: Remedy for murrain.]\r\n  depe or more. And this is the remedy for the murren.              24\r\n  Take a smalle curteyne-corde, and bynde it harde aboute\r\n      [Sidenote: [Fol. 36.]]\r\n  the beastes necke, and that wyll cause the bloudde to\r\n  come in-to the necke, and on eyther syde of the necke\r\n  there is a vayne that a man may fele with his fynger; and         28\r\n      [Sidenote: Bleed the sick cattle.]\r\n  than take a bloud-yren, and set it streight vppon the\r\n  vayne, and smyte him bloudde on bothe sydes, and let\r\n  hym blede the mountenaunce of a pynte or nyghe it, and\r\n  than take awaye the corde, and it wyll staunche bleding.          32\r\n  And thus serue all thy cattell, that be in that close or\r\n  pasture, and there shall no mo be sicke, by goddes leue.\r\n\r\n\r\n  59. ¶ Longe sought, and remedy therefore.\r\n\r\n  There is an nother maner of sycknesse among bestes,\r\n      [Sidenote: ‘Long sought.’]\r\n  and it is called longe soughte; and that sickenes wyl\r\n  endure lo_n_g, and ye shal perceyue it by his hoystynge;\r\n  he wyl stande moche, and eate but a littel, and waxe very          4\r\n      [Sidenote: The beast coughs 20 times an hour.]\r\n  holowe & thin. And he wil hoyst .xx. times in an houre,\r\n  and but fewe of them do mende. The best remedy is to\r\n  kepe thy cattell in sondrye places, and as many as were\r\n  in companye with that beast that fyrst fell sycke, to let          8\r\n      [Sidenote: [Fol. 36_b_.]]\r\n  them a lyttel bloude. And there be many men, that can\r\n      [Sidenote: Cut the dewlap.]\r\n  seuer them, and that is to cutte the dewlappe before, and\r\n  there is a grasse that is called feitergrasse, take that\r\n  grasse, and broyse it a lyttell in a morter, and thanne put       12\r\n  therof as moche as an hennes egge in-to the sayd dewlappe,\r\n  and se it fall not oute.

This is the cause of his dysease.\r\n  There is a blyster rysen vnder the tounge, the whiche\r\n  blyster must be slytte with a knyfe a-crosse. Whan ye              8\r\n      [Sidenote: Find the blister under the tongue, and cut it.]\r\n  haue pulled out the tongue, rubbe the blyster well with\r\n  salte, and take an hennes egge, and breake it in the\r\n  beastes mouthe shell and all, and cast salte to it, and\r\n  holde vp the bestes heed, that all maye be swalowed               12\r\n  downe into the body. But the breakynge of the blyster\r\n  is the greate helpe, and dryue the beaste a lyttell aboute,\r\n  and this shall saue hym, by the helpe of Jesu.\r\n\r\n\r\n  62. ==> The turne, and remedy therfor.\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: [Fol. 37_b_.]]\r\n      [Sidenote: ‘The turn.’]\r\n  There be beastes that wyll turne about, whan they\r\n  eate theyr meate, and wyll not fede, and is great\r\n  ieoperdy for fallynge in pyttes, dyches, or waters: and\r\n      [Sidenote: There is a bladder between the brain and\r\n       brain-pan.]\r\n  it is bycause that there is a bladder in the foreheed              4\r\n  bytwene the brayne-panne and the braynes, the whiche\r\n  must be taken out, or els he shal neuer mende, but dye\r\n  at lengthe, and this is the remedy and the greatest cure\r\n  that can be on a beaste. Take that beast, and cast him             8\r\n  downe, and bynde his foure fete together, and with thy\r\n  thombe, thrust the beast in the foreheed, and where\r\n  thou fyndest the softest place, there take a knyfe, and\r\n  cut the skyn, three or foure inches on bothe sides                12\r\n  bytwene the hornes, and as moche benethe towarde\r\n  the nose, and fley it, and turne it vp, and pyn it faste\r\n  with a pyn, and with a knyfe cut the brayne-pan .ii.\r\n      [Sidenote: Cut the bone, but not the brain, and take out\r\n       the bladder.]\r\n  inches brode, and thre inches longe, but se the knyfe             16\r\n  go no deper than the thycknes of the bone for perysshynge\r\n  of the brayne, and take away the bone, and than\r\n  shalt thou se a bladder full of water two inches longe\r\n  and more, take that out, and hurte not the brayne, and            20\r\n  thanne let downe the skynne, and sowe it faste there\r\n  as it was before, and bynde a clothe two or thre folde\r\n  vpon his foreheed, to kepe it from colde and wete .x. or\r\n      [Sidenote: [Fol. 38.]]\r\n  .xii. dayes. And thus haue I seen many mended. But                24\r\n  if the beaste be fatte, and any reasonable meate vpon\r\n  hym, it is best to kyll hym, for than there is but lyttell\r\n  losse. And if the bladder be vnder the horne, it is\r\n  past cure. A shepe wyll haue the turne as well as a               28\r\n  beast, but I haue seen none mended.\r\n\r\n\r\n  63. ==> The warrybrede, and the remedy therfore.\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: ‘Warrybrede.’]\r\n  There be beastes that wyll haue warrybredes in dyuers\r\n  partes of theyr body and legges, and this is the remedy.\r\n  Cast hym downe, and bynde his foure fete together, and\r\n      [Sidenote: Take a hot iron, and sear it.]\r\n  take a culture, or a payre of tonges, or such an other             4\r\n  yren, and take it glowing hote: and if it be a longe\r\n  warrybrede, sere it of harde by the body, and if it be\r\n  in the beginninge, and be but flatte, than lay the hot\r\n  yren vpon it, and sere it to the bare skyn, and it will be         8\r\n  hole for euer, be it horse or beast.\r\n\r\n\r\n  64. ¶ The foule, and the remedy therfore.\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: ‘The foul.’]\r\n  There be bestes, that wyll haue the foule, and that\r\n  is betwene the cleese, sometyme before, and sometyme\r\n      [Sidenote: [Fol. 38_b_.]]\r\n  behynde, and it wyll swell, and cause hym to halt, and\r\n  this is the remedy. Cast hym downe and bind his foure              4\r\n      [Sidenote: Rub a rope between his claws till he bleeds.]\r\n  fete together, & take a rope of heare, or a hey-rope,\r\n  harde wrythen together, and put it betwene his cleese,\r\n  and drawe the rope to and fro a good season, tyll he\r\n  blede well, and than laye to it softe made terre, and              8\r\n  binde a cloute aboute it, that noo myre nor grauell\r\n  come betwene the clese: and put hym in a pasture, or\r\n  let hym stande styll in the house, and he wyll be\r\n  shortly hole.                                                     12\r\n\r\n\r\n  65. ¶ The goute, without remedy.\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: The gout.]\r\n  There be beastes, that wyll haue the goute, and moste\r\n  commonly in the hynder fete, and it wyll cause them to\r\n  halt, and go starkely. And I knewe neuer manne that\r\n      [Sidenote: No remedy.]\r\n  coulde helpe it, or fynde remedye therfore, but all-onely          4\r\n  to put hym in good grasse, and fede hym.\r\n\r\n\r\n  66. ¶ To rere calues.\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: To rear calves.]\r\n  It is conueniente for a housbande to rere calues, and\r\n  specyally those that come bytwene Candelmasse and\r\n  Maye, for that season he may spare mylke beste; and by\r\n      [Sidenote: [Fol. 39.]]\r\n  that tyme the calfe shall be wayned, there wyll be grasse          4\r\n  ynoughe to put hym vnto. And at winter he wyll be\r\n  bygge ynoughe to saue hym-selfe amonge other beastes,\r\n  with a lyttell fauoure. And the damme of the calfe shall\r\n  bull agayne, and brynge an other by the same time of               8\r\n  the yere: and if thou shalt tary tyll after May, the calfe\r\n  wolde be weyke in wynter, and the damme wolde not\r\n  bull agayne: but ofte tyme go bareyn. And if thou\r\n  shalte rere a calfe that commeth after Myghelmasse, it            12\r\n  wyll be costly to kepe the calfe all the wynter-season at\r\n  hey, and the damme at harde meate in the house, as they\r\n  vse in the playne champyon countrey. And a cowe shall\r\n      [Sidenote: A cow gives more milk on grass than on hay.]\r\n  gyue more mylke with a lyttell grasse and strawe, lyenge          16\r\n  without in a close, thanne she shall doo with hey and\r\n  strawe, lyenge in an house; for the harde meate dryeth\r\n  vp the mylke. But he that hath no pasture, muste do as\r\n  he may; but yet is it better to the housbande to sell those       20\r\n  calues than to rere them, bycause of the cost, and also\r\n  for the profytte of the mylke to his house, and the rather\r\n  the cowe wyll take the bull. If the husbande go with\r\n  an oxe-plough, it is conuenient that he rere two oxe-calues       24\r\n  and two cowe-calues at the least, to vpholde his\r\n  flocke, and if he maye do moo, it wyll be more profyte.\r\n      [Sidenote: [Fol. 39_b_.]]\r\n  And it is better, to wayne thy calues at grasse before.\r\n  And that man, that maye haue a pasture for his kye, and           28\r\n  an other for his calues, and water in them both, maye\r\n  rere and brede good beastes with lyghte coste. And if\r\n      [Sidenote: Do not wean calves on hay.]\r\n  thou waine thy calues with hey, it wyl make them haue\r\n  great belyes, and the rather they wyll rotte whan they            32\r\n  come to grasse, and in wynter they wolde be put in a\r\n  house by them-selfe, and gyuen hey on the nyghtes, and\r\n  put in a good pasture on the day, and they shal be moche\r\n  better to handell, whan they shal be kye or oxen.                 36\r\n\r\n\r\n  67. ==> To gelde calues.\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: To geld ox-calves.]\r\n  It is tyme to gelde his oxen calues in the olde of the\r\n  mone, whan they be .x. or .xx. dayes olde, for than it is\r\n  leaste ieoperdye, and the oxe shall be the more hyer, and\r\n  the lenger of body, and the le_n_ger horned: and that maye         4\r\n  be well prouyd, to take two oxe-calues, both of one kynde,\r\n  of one makynge, and both of one age; gelde one of\r\n  them, and let the other goo forthe and be a bull, and\r\n      [Sidenote: A gelt calf grows bigger than a bull.]\r\n  put theym bothe in one pasture, tyll they be foure or              8\r\n  fyue yere olde: and than shall ye se the oxe-calfe ferre\r\n      [Sidenote: [Fol. 40.]]\r\n  greatter euery waye than the bull; there is noo cause but\r\n  the geldynge; and yf thou gelde them not tyll they be\r\n  a yere olde, there is more ieopardye, he shall be lesse of        12\r\n  bodye, and shorte-horned.\r\n\r\n\r\n  68. ¶ Horses and mares to drawe.\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: Horses and mares.]\r\n  A husbande maye not be withoute horses and mares,\r\n  or bothe; and specially, if he go with a horse-ploughe, he\r\n  muste haue both his horses to drawe, and his mares to\r\n  brynge coltes, to vpholde his flocke, and yet at manye             4\r\n  tymes they maye drawe well, if they be well handled.\r\n  But they maye not beare sackes, nor be rydden vppon\r\n  noo iourneys whan they be with foole, and specyally\r\n  whanne they haue gone with foole .xx. or .xxiiii. wekes,           8\r\n      [Sidenote: Take care of the mares.]\r\n  for than is the greateste ieopardy. For yf she be rydden\r\n  vppon, and sette vp hotte, or tourned out and take cold,\r\n  she wil caste her foole, the whiche woll be a greatte losse\r\n  to the housbande. For she wyll labour and beare whan              12\r\n  she hath fooled, and drawe whan she is with foole, as\r\n  well as the horse. It is conuenient for the husbande to\r\n  knowe, whanne his mare wolde be horsed. It is the\r\n      [Sidenote: [Fol. 40_b_.]]\r\n  common sayenge, that she wyll take the hors within .ix. or        16\r\n  .x. dayes, nexte after that she hath fooled: but that saying\r\n  I holde not with, for and she do so, she wyll not holde\r\n  therto, for the hors dothe dryue her to it. But .xx.\r\n  days after, is tymely ynoughe to brynge her to a hors.            20\r\n  For she wyl not holde to it, excepte she be kene of horsyng,\r\n  and that shal ye knowe by her shap, for that wyll twyrle\r\n  open, and close agayne, many tymes in an houre: and than\r\n  brynge her to a hors, and let her be with hym a day or a          24\r\n  nyght, and that is suffycyent. For it is better, to kepe\r\n      [Sidenote: Keep the horse from the mares.]\r\n  the horse frome the mares, than to go with them, for\r\n  dyuers causes, and specyally he shall be more lusty, and\r\n  the moo horse-coltes shall he gete. But he that hath              28\r\n  very many mares, may not alway attende them, but let\r\n  them go to-gether, and take as god sendes it. Some\r\n  men holde an opinion, that if the horse be put to the\r\n      [Sidenote: Men have various opinions about foals.]\r\n  mare in the begynnynge of the moone, after it be prime,           32\r\n  he shall gete a horse-foole. And some men saye the contrary:\r\n  that if he be putte to the mare in the olde of\r\n  the mone, he shoulde gete horse-fooles.

A parke is best kept, where\r\n  there is neyther man, dogge, nor foure-foted beast therin,\r\n  except dere.

And also cheryes, filberdes, bulleys,\r\n  dampsons, plummes, walnuttes, and suche other. And                 4\r\n  therfore it is conuenyent to lerne howe thou shalte\r\n  graffe. Than it is to be knowen what thynges thou\r\n      [Sidenote: A grafting-saw.]\r\n  must haue to graffe withall. Thou muste haue a graffynge-sawe,\r\n  the whiche wolde be very thynne, and                               8\r\n  thycke-tothed; and bycause it is thynne, it wyll cut the\r\n  narower kyrfe, and the cleaner, for brusynge of the barke.\r\n  And therfore it is sette in a compasse pece of yren,\r\n  syxe inches of, to make it styffe and bygge. Thou                 12\r\n      [Sidenote: Grafting-knife.]\r\n  muste haue also a graffynge-knyfe, an inche brode, with\r\n      [Sidenote: [Fol. 55*.]]\r\n  a thycke backe, to cleue the stocke with-all. And also\r\n      [Sidenote: Mallet, and sharp small knives.]\r\n  a mallet, to dryue the knyfe and thy wedge in-to the\r\n  tree: and a sharpe knife, to pare the stockes heed, and           16\r\n  an other sharpe knyfe, to cutte the graffe cleane. And\r\n      [Sidenote: Two wedges.]\r\n  also thou muste haue two wedges of harde wood, or elles\r\n  of yren, a longe small one for a small stocke, and broder\r\n  for a bygger stocke, to open the stocke, whan it is clouen        20\r\n      [Sidenote: Clay, moss, and bast.]\r\n  and pared: and also good tough claye and mosse, and\r\n  also bastes or pyllynge of wethy or elme, to bynde them\r\n  with, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n  137. ¶ What fruite shuld be fyrste graffed.\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: Graft pears before apples.]\r\n  Peares and wardens wolde be graffed before any maner\r\n  of apples, bycause the sappe commeth sooner and rather\r\n  in-to the peare-tree and warden-tree, thanne in-to the\r\n      [Sidenote: Graft from Feb. 14 to March 25.]\r\n  apple-tree.

And a peare or a warden wolde be\r\n  graded in a pyrre-stocke; and if thou canst get none,\r\n      [Sidenote: [Fol. 55*_b_.]]\r\n  than graffe it in a crabbe-tree stocke, and it wyll do well:\r\n  and some men grade theym in a whyte-thorne, and than              12\r\n      [Sidenote: A crab-stock is best for apples.]\r\n  it wyll be the more harder and stonye. And for all\r\n  maner of appels, the crabtree stocke is beste.\r\n\r\n\r\n  138. ¶ Howe to graffe.\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: Select the graft.]\r\n  Thou muste get thy graffes of the fayrest lanses, that\r\n  thou canste fynde on the tree, and see that it haue a good\r\n      [Sidenote: Saw the crab-tree,]\r\n  knotte or ioynte, and an euen.

For the barke of the graffe is\r\n  neuer soo thicke as the barke of the stocke. And therfore\r\n  thou mayste not sette the barkes mete on the vtter\r\n  syde, but on the inner syde: than pulle awaye thy wedge,          24\r\n  and it wyl stande moche faster. Than take toughe cleye,\r\n  lyke marley, and ley it vppon the stocke-heed, and with\r\n  thy fynger laye it close vnto the graffe, and a lyttel vnder\r\n  the heed, to kepe it moyst, and that no wynde come into           28\r\n      [Sidenote: Cover with moss, and bind with bast.]\r\n  the stocke at the cleauynge. Than take mosse, and laye\r\n  thervpon, for chynynge of the claye: than take a baste\r\n  of whyte wethy or elme, or halfe a bryer, and bynd the\r\n  mosse, the clay, and the graffe together, but be well ware,       32\r\n  that thou breake not thy graffe, neyther in the clayenge,\r\n  nor in the byndynge; and thou muste set some-thinge\r\n  by the graffe, that crowes, nor byrdes do not lyght vpon\r\n  thy graffe, for if they do, they wil breake hym, &c.              36\r\n\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: [Fol. 56*_b_.]]\r\n  139. ¶ To graffe bytwene the barke and the tree.\r\n\r\n  There is an other maner of graffinge than this, and\r\n  soner done, & soner to growe: but it is more ieoperdy for\r\n      [Sidenote: Another way of grafting.]\r\n  winde whan it begynneth to growe. Thou muste sawe\r\n  thy stocke, and pare the heed therof, as thou diddest              4\r\n  before, but cleue it not: than take thy graffe, and cut it in\r\n  the ioynt to the myddes, and make the tenaunte therof\r\n  halfe an inche longe or a lyttell more, all on the one syde,\r\n  and pare the barke awaye a lyttel at the poynt on the              8\r\n      [Sidenote: Use a punch of hard wood.]\r\n  other syde: than thou muste haue made redy a ponch of\r\n  harde wood, with a stop and a tenaunte on the one syde,\r\n  lyke to the tenaunte of the graffe.

And this\r\n  can-not fayle, for now the sappe cometh on euery syde,\r\n  but it wyl spring soo faste, that if it stande on playne          16\r\n      [Sidenote: The graft requires protection from the wind.]\r\n  grounde, the wynde is lykelye to blowe it besyde the\r\n  heed, for it hath no fastnes in the wodde.

At grammer-scole I\r\n      [Sidenote: Early rising makes a man healthy, holy,\r\n       and rich.]\r\n  lerned a verse, that is this, _Sanat, sanctificat, et ditat\r\n  surgere mane_. That is to say, Erly rysyng maketh a man           12\r\n  hole in body, holer in soule, and rycher in goodes. And\r\n  this me semeth shuld be sufficient instruction for the\r\n  husbande to kepe measure.\r\n\r\n\r\n  150. ¶ How men of hye degree do kepe measure.\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: Men of high degree are too prodigal and wasteful.]\r\n  To me it is doubtefull, but yet me semeth, they be\r\n  rather to lyberall in expences, than to scarce, and\r\n  specyally in three thynges. The fyrste is prodigalytie in\r\n  outragious and costely aray, fer aboue measure; the                4\r\n  seconde thynge is costely charge of delycyous meates and\r\n  drynkes; the thyrde is outragious playe and game, ferre\r\n  aboue measure.

Nowe I haue shewed you the sayinge of the                  8\r\n  philosopher, wherby you haue goten moche worldely\r\n  possession, me semeth it were necessary, to shewe you\r\n  howe ye maye gette heuenly possessions, accordynge to\r\n      [Sidenote: Matt. xvi. 26.]\r\n  the sayenge of our lorde in his gospel, _Quid prodest             12\r\n  homini, si vniuersum mundum lucretur, animæ vero suæ detrimentum\r\n  paciatur_: What profyteth it to a man, thoughe\r\n  he wyn all the worlde, to the hyndraunce and losyng\r\n  of his soule? Howe be it, it shoulde seme vnconuenient            16\r\n  for a temporall man to take vpon hym to shewe\r\n  or teache any suche spirytuall matters; and yet there is\r\n  a great diuersytie betwene predication and doctrine.\r\n\r\n\r\n  155. ¶ A diuersitie betwene predication and doctrine.\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: [Fol. 70.]]\r\n  As sayncte Iherome saythe, there is greate difference or\r\n      [Sidenote: Difference between preaching and doctrine.]\r\n  diuersitie betwene preachinge and doctrine.

And it belongeth to theym that be ordeyned\r\n      [Sidenote: Every man may teach.]\r\n  there-vnto, and haue iurisdiction and auctorytie, and to\r\n  none other. But euery man may lawefully enforme and                8\r\n  teache his brother, or any other, at euery tyme and place\r\n  behouable, if it seme expedient to hym, for that is an\r\n  almes-dede, to the whiche euery man is holden &\r\n  bounde to do, accordyng to the sayenge of saynt                   12\r\n      [Sidenote: 1 Pet. iv. 10.]\r\n  Peter, _Vnusquisq_ue, _sicut accepit gratiam, in alterutrum\r\n  illam administrare debet_. That is to saye, as euery man\r\n  hath taken or receyued grace, he oughte to mynyster\r\n      [Sidenote: Chrysostom.]\r\n  and shewe it forthe to other. For as Chrisostome saythe,          16\r\n  great merite is to hym, and a great reward he shall haue\r\n  in tyme to come, the which writeth or causeth to be\r\n  writen, holy doctrine, for that entent, that he may se in\r\n  it, howe he may lyue holylye, and that other may haue             20\r\n  it, that they maye be edyfyed or sanctyfyed by the same;\r\n  for he saythe surely, knowe thou, that howe many soules\r\n      [Sidenote: [Fol. 70_b_.]]\r\n  be saued by the, soo many rewardes thou shalte haue for\r\n      [Sidenote: Gregory.]\r\n  eyther. For saynt Gregory saythe, _Nullum sacrificium ita         24\r\n  placet deo, sicut zelus animaru_m: There is no sacrifyce\r\n  that pleaseth god so moche, as the loue of soules. And\r\n      [Sidenote: Gregory.]\r\n  also he saythe, _Ille apud deum maior est in amore, qui ad\r\n  eius amorem plurimos trahit_: He is greateste in fauour           28\r\n  with god, that draweth moste men to the loue of god.\r\n  Wherfore me semeth, it is co_n_uenient to enforme and\r\n  shewe them, how they maye gette heuenly possessions,\r\n  as well as I haue shewed them to get worldly possessions.         32\r\n  Than to my purpose, and to the poynt where I lefte,\r\n  ‘nowe thou art ryche.’\r\n\r\n\r\n  156. ¶ What is rychesse.\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: What is riches.]\r\n  It is to be vnderstande what is rychesse; and as me\r\n  semeth, rychesse is that thynge, that is of goodnes, and\r\n  can-not be taken awaye from the owner, neyther in his\r\n  temporall lyfe, nor in the lyfe euerlastynge. Than these           4\r\n  worldly possessions, that I haue spoken of, is no richesse,\r\n  for why they be but floures of the worlde. And that may\r\n  be wel consydered by Iob, the whiche was the rychest\r\n  man of worldely possessions, that was lyuynge in those             8\r\n      [Sidenote: [Fol. 71.]]\r\n  daies, and sodeynely he was the poorest man agayne that\r\n  coulde be lyuynge, and all the whyle he toke pacyence, and\r\n      [Sidenote: Job i. 21.]\r\n  was content, as appereth by his sayenge, _Dominus dedit,\r\n  dominus abstulit: sicut domino placuit, ita factum est, sit       12\r\n  nomen domini benedictum_: Our lorde hath gyuen it, our\r\n  lorde hath taken it awaye, and as it pleaseth our lorde,\r\n  so be it, blessed be the name of our lorde. The whiche\r\n  Iob may be an ensample to euery true chrysten man, of             16\r\n  his pacyence and good liuing in tribulation, as appereth\r\n  in his storye, who that lyste to rede therin. And saynte\r\n      [Sidenote: Augustine.]\r\n  Austyne saythe: _Qui terrenis inhiat, et æterna non cogitat,\r\n  utrisq_ue _in futuro carebit_: he that gathereth in worldly       20\r\n  thynges, and thynketh not vppon euerlastynge thynges,\r\n  shall wante bothe in tyme to come. For sayncte\r\n      [Sidenote: Ambrose.]\r\n  Ambrose saythe, _Non sunt bona hominis, quæ secum ferre\r\n  non potest_: They are not the goodes of man, the whiche           24\r\n      [Sidenote: Bernard.]\r\n  he can-not beare with him. And saynte Bernarde saythe:\r\n  _Si vestra sint, tollite vobiscum_: Yf they be yours, take them\r\n  with you. Than it is to be vnderstande, what goodes a\r\n  man shall take with hym. And these be the good dedes              28\r\n  and warkes that thou doste here in this temporall lyfe,\r\n      [Sidenote: Chrysostom.]\r\n  wherof speketh Crysostome: _Fac bene, et operare iustitiam,\r\n      [Sidenote: [Fol. 71_b_.]]\r\n  vt spem habeas apud deum, et non desperabis in terra_: Doo\r\n  well, and worke ryghtwysly, that thou mayste haue truste          32\r\n  in god, and that thou be not in despayre in this worlde.\r\n      [Sidenote: Ps. xxxvii. 25.]\r\n  Accordynge to that saythe the prophete Dauyd, _Iunior\r\n      [Sidenote: (Ps. xxxvi. 25, Vulgate.)]\r\n  fui, etenim senui, et non vidi iustum derelictum, nec semen\r\n  eius querens panem_: I haue ben yonge, and I haue waxen           36\r\n  olde, and I haue not seen a ryghtwyse man forsaken, nor\r\n  his chyldren sekynge theyr breade.\r\n\r\n\r\n  157. ¶ What is the propertie of a riche man.\r\n\r\n  In myne opynyon the propertye of a ryche manne is, to\r\n  be a purchaser; and if he wyll purchase, I councell hym\r\n      [Sidenote: Augustine.]\r\n  to purchase heuen. For sayncte Austyne saythe, _Regnum\r\n  cælorum nulli clauditur, nisi illi, qui se excluserit_: The        4\r\n  kyngedome of heuen is to noo man closed, but to hym\r\n  that wyll putte oute hym-selfe. Wherfore this texte\r\n  maye gyue the a courage to prefixe thy mynde, to make\r\n  there thy purchase. And Salomon saythe: _Quod mali                 8\r\n  carius emunt infernum, quam boni cælum_: Ill men bye\r\n  hell derer, thanne the good men bie heuen. And that me\r\n      [Sidenote: [Fol. 72.]]\r\n  semeth maye well be proued by a common ensample: As\r\n  if I had a .M. shepe to sell, and dyuers men come to me,          12\r\n      [Sidenote: Suppose I sell 1000 sheep, 100 to each of\r\n       10 men.]\r\n  and bye euery manne a .C. of the shepe, all of one price,\r\n  to paye me at dyuers dayes. I am agreed, and graunt\r\n  them these dayes; some of the menne be good, and kepe\r\n  theyr promesse, and paye me at theyr dayes, and some of           16\r\n  theym doo not paye me. Wherfore I sue theym at the\r\n      [Sidenote: Those who do not pay I imprison for debt.]\r\n  lawe, and by course of the common lawe, I doo recouer\r\n  my duetie of them, and haue theyr bodyes in prisone for\r\n  execution, tylle they haue made me payment. Nowe these            20\r\n  men, that haue broken me promesse, and payed not theyr\r\n      [Sidenote: These men buy their sheep dearer than the others.]\r\n  dewetye, bye theyr shepe derer thanne the good menne\r\n  bought theyrs. For they haue imprysonment of theyr\r\n  bodyes, and yet must they pay theyr duetyes neuer the             24\r\n  lesse, or elles lye and dye there in pryson: the whiche\r\n  sheepe be derer to them, then to the good men that\r\n      [Sidenote: So it is with men who buy heaven.]\r\n  kepte theyr promes. Righte so euery man chepeth\r\n  heuen, and god hath sette on it a pryce, and graunted             28\r\n  it to euery man, and giuen to them dayes of payment:\r\n  the pryce is all one, and that is to kepe his commaundementes,\r\n  duryng theyr lyues: the good men kepe his\r\n  commaundementes, and fulfyll theyr promesse, and haue             32\r\n  heuen at theyr decease. The yll men breake promesse,\r\n      [Sidenote: [Fol. 72_b_.]]\r\n  & kepe not his commaundementes, wherfore at theyr\r\n  decease they be put in pryson, that is to say in hell,\r\n  there to abyde his ryghtuousenes. And soo the yll men             36\r\n      [Sidenote: Ill men buy hell dearer than good men buy\r\n       heaven.]\r\n  bye hell derer, than the good menne bye heuen. And\r\n  therfore it is better, to forgoo a lyttel pleasure, or suffer[33]\r\n  a lyttell payne in this worlde, than to suffer a moche\r\n  greatter and a lenger payne in an other worlde. Nowe              40\r\n  sythe helle is derer than heuen, I aduyse the specyally\r\n      [Sidenote: Wherefore buy heaven.]\r\n  to bye heuen, wherin is euerlastynge ioye without ende.\r\n\r\n\r\n  158. ¶ What ioyes or pleasures are in heuen.\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: Augustine.]\r\n  Saynt Austyn saythe, _Ibi erunt quæcunq_ue _ab hominibus\r\n  desiderantur, vita et salus, copia glorie, honor, pax, et\r\n  omnia bona_: That is to saye, There shall be euery thynge\r\n  that any man desyreth, there is lyfe, helth, plenty of ioye,       4\r\n  honour, peace, and all maner of goodnes. What wolde a\r\n      [Sidenote: 1 Cor. ii. 9. Isa. lxiv. 4.]\r\n  man haue more? And saynt Paule sayth, _Occulus non vidit,\r\n  nec auris audiuit, nec in cor hominis ascendit, quæ preparuit deus\r\n  diligentibus se_: That is to say, The eye hath not seen, nor       8\r\n  the eares hath herde, nor the herte of a man hath thought\r\n      [Sidenote: [Fol. 73.]]\r\n  of so goodly thynges, that god hath ordeyned for theym\r\n  that loue hym. O what a noble acte that were for an\r\n  husbande or houswyfe, to purchase suche a royall place in         12\r\n  heuen, to whiche is no comparyson. Than it is to\r\n  be knowen, what thynge pleaseth god most, that we myght\r\n  do it.\r\n\r\n\r\n  159. ¶ What thynges pleaseth god most.\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: 1 Cor. ii. 9.]\r\n  By the texte of sayncte Paule, before sayd, loue pleaseth\r\n  god aboue al thinge, and that maye be well proued by the\r\n      [Sidenote: Prov. xxxiii. 26.]\r\n  sayinge of our lorde hym-selfe, where he saythe: _Da mihi\r\n  cor tuum, et sufficit mihi_; Gyue me thy harte, and that is        4\r\n  sufficiente for me; for he that hath a mannes harte, hath\r\n  all his other goodes. What is this mans harte? it is\r\n  nothyng elles, but very trewe loue. For there can be no\r\n  true loue, but it commeth meryly and immediately from              8\r\n  the harte: and if thou loue god entyerlye with thy harte,\r\n  than wylte thou do his commaundementes. Than it wolde\r\n  be vnderstande and knowen whiche be his commandementes,\r\n  that a man may obserue and kepe them.                             12\r\n\r\n\r\n  160. ¶ What be goddes commaundementes.\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: [Fol. 73_b_.]]\r\n  There be in all .x. commaundementes, the which were\r\n  to long to declare, but they be all concluded and comprehended\r\n      [Sidenote: Deut. vi. 5. Lev. xix. 18.]\r\n  in two, that is to say: _Diliges dominum deum tuum\r\n  super omnia: Et proximum tuu_m _sicut te ipsum_: Loue thy          4\r\n  lorde god aboue al thing, and thy neyghboure as thy-selfe.\r\n  These be lyghte commaundementes, and nature byndeth\r\n  a man to fulfyll, obserue, and kepe them, or els he is not\r\n  a naturall man, remembryng what god hath doone for the.            8\r\n  Fyrste he hath made the to the symylytude and lykenes\r\n  of his owne ymage, and hathe gyuen to the in this worlde\r\n  dyuerse possessions, but specyally he hath redemed thy\r\n  soule vpon the crosse, and suffered great payne and               12\r\n  passion and bodelye deathe for thy sake. What loue,\r\n  what kyndenes was in hym, to doo this for the? What\r\n  couldest thou desyre hym to do more for the? And he\r\n      [Sidenote: God asks love for love.]\r\n  desyreth nothynge of the agayne, but loue for loue. What          16\r\n  can he desyre lesse?\r\n\r\n\r\n  161. ¶ Howe a man shulde loue god and please hym.\r\n\r\n  Surelye a man maye loue god and please hym very many\r\n  wayes: but fyrste and principally, he that wyll loue god,\r\n      [Sidenote: [Fol. 74.]]\r\n  and please hym, he muste doo as it is sayde in Symbalo\r\n      [Sidenote: Athanasian Creed.]\r\n  Athanasii: _Quicunq_ue _vult saluus esse, ante omnia opus est      4\r\n  vt teneat catholica_m _fidem_, Who so euer wyll be saued,\r\n  aboue all thynge he must nedes be stedfast in the faythe\r\n  of holy churche. And accordynge to that, saythe sayncte\r\n      [Sidenote: Heb. xi. 6.]\r\n  Paule: _Sine fide impossibile est placere deo_; Without faythe     8\r\n      [Sidenote: Seneca.]\r\n  it is impossible to please god. And Seneca sayth: _Nichil\r\n  retinet, qui fidem perdidit_: There abydeth no goodnes in\r\n  hym, that hath loste his faythe. And soo thou mayste\r\n  well perceyue, that thou canst not loue nor please god,           12\r\n  without perfyte fayth. And ferther-more thou mayste not\r\n  presume to study, nor to argue thy faithe by reason. For\r\n      [Sidenote: Gregory; xl. Homil. in Evang. ii. 26.]\r\n  saynte Gregory saythe: _Fides non habet meritum, vbi humana\r\n  ratio prebet experimentum_: Faythe hath no meryte, where          16\r\n  as mannes reasone proueth the same. This faythe is a\r\n  pryncypall sygne, that thou loueste god. Also thy good\r\n  dedes, and thy warkes, is a good sygne, that thou loueste\r\n      [Sidenote: Jerome.]\r\n  god. For saynt Iherome saythe: _Vnusquisque, cuius opera          20\r\n  facit, eius filius appellatur_: whose warkes euery man dothe,\r\n      [Sidenote: Bernard.]\r\n  his son or seruaunt he is called. And sayncte Bernarde\r\n  saythe, _Efficatior est vox operis, q_uam _vox sermonis_: The\r\n      [Sidenote: [Fol. 74_b_.]]\r\n  dedes and the warkes of a man is more euydent profe,              24\r\n      [Sidenote: Seven works of mercy.]\r\n  than his wordes. The fulfyllynge of the .vii. workes of\r\n  mercye is an other specyall sygne, that thou louest god:\r\n  and many mo there be, whiche were to longe to reherse\r\n  them all.                                                         28\r\n\r\n\r\n  162. ¶ Howe a man shulde loue his neyghbour.\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: Love of our neighbour.]\r\n  Thou must loue thy neyghboure as thy-selfe, wherin\r\n  thou shalt please god specially: for if thou loue thy\r\n  neyghbour as thy-selfe, it foloweth by reason, that\r\n  thou shalte do nothyng to hym, but suche as thou                   4\r\n  woldest shulde be done to the. And that is to\r\n  presume, that thou woldest not haue any hurte of thy\r\n  body, nor of thy goodes, done vnto the, and lykewyse\r\n  thou shuldest none do vnto hym. And also if thou                   8\r\n  woldest haue any goodnes done vnto the, eyther in thy\r\n  bodye, or in thy mouable goodes, lykewyse shuldest thou\r\n  do vnto thy neyghbour, if it lye in thye power, accordynge\r\n      [Sidenote: Gregory.]\r\n  to the sayinge of saynte Gregorye, _Nec deus sine proximo,        12\r\n  nec proximus vere diligitur sine deo_: Thou canste not loue\r\n  god, with-out thou loue thy neyghbour, nor thou canst not\r\n  loue thy neighbour, without thou loue god. Wherfore\r\n      [Sidenote: [Fol. 75.]]\r\n  thou muste fyrste loue god pryncypallye, and thy neyghbour        16\r\n  secondaryly.\r\n\r\n\r\n  163. ¶ Of prayer that pleaseth god very moche.\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: Prayer pleaseth God much.]\r\n  Prayer is honour and laude to god, and a specyall\r\n  thynge that pleaseth hym moche, and is a greate sygne,\r\n  that thou louest god, and that thou arte perfyte and\r\n  stedfaste in the faythe of holy churche: and that it is so,        4\r\n  it maye be well consydered by our forefathers, that haue\r\n  for the loue and honour of god made churches. And a\r\n  man muste dayly at some conuenyente tymes exercyse and\r\n  vse prayer hym-selfe, as he oughte to doo. For saynt               8\r\n      [Sidenote: Ambrose.]\r\n  Ambrose sayth, _Relicto hoc, ad quod teneris, ingratum est\r\n  spiritui sancto quicquid aliud operaris_: If thou leaue that\r\n  thynge vndone, that thou arte bounde to doo, it is not\r\n  acceptable to god, what-so-euer thou dooste elles. Than           12\r\n  it is necessarye, that thou do praye, and a poore manne\r\n  doynge his labour trewely in the daye, and thinketh well,\r\n  prayeth well: but on the holye daye, he is bounde to come\r\n  to the church, and here his diuyne seruyce.                       16\r\n\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: [Fol. 75_b_.]]\r\n  164. ¶ What thynge letteth prayer.\r\n\r\n  There be two impedimentes, that lette and hynder\r\n  prayer, that it maye not be herde. And of the fyrste impedimente\r\n      [Sidenote: Isa. i. 15.]\r\n  speketh Ysaye the prophete: _Quia manus vestræ\r\n  plenæ sunt sanguine .i. peccato, ideo non exaudiet vos dominus_:   4\r\n  Bycause your handes be full of bloude, that is to saye,\r\n  full of synne, therfore our lorde dothe not graciousely\r\n      [Sidenote: Prov. xv. 29.]\r\n  here you. And also prouerbiorum tertio, _Longe est dominus\r\n  ab impiis, et orationes iustorum exaudiet_. Our lorde is ferre     8\r\n  fro wycked men, and the prayers of ryghtewyse men he\r\n      [Sidenote: Bernard.]\r\n  gracyously hereth. And sayncte Bernarde saythe, _Qui a\r\n  præceceptis dei auertitur, quod in oratione postulat non meretur_:\r\n  He that dothe not goddes commaundementes, he                      12\r\n  deserueth not to haue his prayer harde. The seconde\r\n      [Sidenote: Anastasius.]\r\n  impediment, saythe Anastasius, is, _Si non dimittis iniuriam,\r\n  que tibi facta est, non orationem pro te facis, sed maledictionem\r\n  super te inducis_: If thou forgyue not the wronge done            16\r\n  vnto the, thou doste not praye for thy-selfe, but thou\r\n      [Sidenote: Isidore.]\r\n  enducest goddes curse to fall vppon the. And Isodorus\r\n  saythe, _Sicut nullum in vulnere proficit medicamentum, si\r\n  adhuc ferrum in eo sit: ita nihil proficiat oratio illius, cuius  20\r\n      [Sidenote: [Fol. 81; _sic._]]\r\n  adhuc dolor in mente vel odium manet in pectore_. Lyke as\r\n  the playster or medycyne can-not heale a wounde, if there\r\n  be any yren styckinge in the same, ryghte soo the prayer\r\n  of a man profyteth hym not, as longe as there is sorowe           24\r\n  in his mynde, or hate abydynge in his breste. For\r\n      [Sidenote: Augustine.]\r\n  sayncte Austyne saythe, _Si desit charitas, frustra habentur\r\n  cetera_. If charitie wante, all other thynges be voyde.\r\n  Wherfore thou muste se that thou stande in the state of           28\r\n  grace, and not infecte with deedly synne, and than praye\r\n  if thou wylt be harde.\r\n\r\n\r\n  165. ¶ Howe a man shulde praye.\r\n\r\n  It is to be vnderstande that there be dyuers maner\r\n      [Sidenote: Public prayer.]\r\n  of prayinges, _Quedam publica, et quedam priuata_; That\r\n  is to saye, some openlye, and some priuately. Prayer\r\n  openly muste nedes be done in the churche by the                   4\r\n  mynystratours of the same people. For it is done for\r\n  all the comynaltye, and therfore the people in that oughte\r\n  to conferme theym-selfe to the sayde mynystratours, and\r\n  there to be presente to praye vnto god after a dewe                8\r\n      [Sidenote: Private prayer.]\r\n  maner. _Oratio priuata._ The prayer pryuately done,\r\n      [Sidenote: [Fol. 81_b_.]]\r\n  oughte to be doone in secrete places, for two causes.\r\n  For prayer eleuateth and lyfteth vp a mannes mynde\r\n  to god. And the mynde of man is sooner and better                 12\r\n  lyfte vppe whan he is in a pryuye place, and separate\r\n  frome multytude of people. An other cause is to auoyde\r\n  vaynglory that myghte lyghtely ensue or ryse thervppon,\r\n  whan it is doone openly; and therof speketh our                   16\r\n      [Sidenote: Matt. vi. 5.]\r\n  sauyour, where he sayth, _Cum oratis, non eritis sicut\r\n  hypocritæ, qui amant in sinagogis et in angulis platearum\r\n  stantes orare_. That is to saye, whan ye praye, be not\r\n  you as the hypocrytes, the whiche loue to stande in               20\r\n  theyr synagoges and corners of hyghe-wayes to praye.\r\n  Also some folkes pray with the lyppes or mouthe, and\r\n  not with the herte, of whome spekethe our lorde by his\r\n      [Sidenote: Isa. xxix. 13.]\r\n  prophete, _Hij labiis me honorant, cor autem eorum longe          24\r\n  est a me_; They honour me with theyr mouthe, and\r\n      [Sidenote: Gregory.]\r\n  theyr hertes be ferre from me. And sayncte Gregory\r\n  saythe, _Quid prodest strepitus labiorum vbi mutum est cor?_\r\n  What profyteth the labour of the mouthe, where the                28\r\n      [Sidenote: Isidore.]\r\n  herte is dombe? And Isodore saythe, _Longe quippe a\r\n  deo est animus, qui in oratione cogitationibus sæculi fuerit\r\n  occupatus_. His soule is far from god, that in his prayer\r\n  his mynde is occupied in warkes of the worlde. There              32\r\n      [Sidenote: [Fol. 82.]]\r\n  be other that pray both with the mouth and hart, of\r\n      [Sidenote: John iv. 24.]\r\n  whom speketh sayncte Iohan .x. _Veri adoratores, adorabunt\r\n  patrem in spiritu et veritate_. The true prayers wylle\r\n  worshyp the father of heauen in spirite and with trouthe.         36\r\n      [Sidenote: Isidore.]\r\n  Isodorus saythe, _Tunc veraciter oramus, quando aliunde\r\n  non cogitamus_. Than we praye truely, whan we thynke\r\n      [Sidenote: Richard of Hampole.]\r\n  on nothynge elles. _Richardus de Hampole. Ille deuote\r\n  orat, qui non habet cor vacabundum in terrenis occupationibus,    40\r\n  sed sublatum ad deum in cælestibus._ He prayeth deuoutly,\r\n  that hath not his harte wauerynge in worldelye occupations,\r\n  but alwaye subleuate and lyfte vppe to god in\r\n  heuen. There be other that praye with the harte. vnde             44\r\n      [Sidenote: Matt. vi. 6.]\r\n  Mat. vi. _Tu autem cum oraueris, intra [in] cubiculum tuum\r\n  .i. in loco secreto, et clauso hostio, ora patrem tuum._ Whan\r\n  thou shalte praye, entre into thy chambre or oratory,\r\n  and steke the doore, and praye to the father of heuen.            48\r\n      [Sidenote: Isidore.]\r\n  Isodorus, _Ardens oratio est non labiorum sed cordium, potius\r\n  enim orandum est corde q_uam _ore_. The hoter prayer is\r\n  with the harte than with the lyppes, rather pray with\r\n      [Sidenote: 1 Sam. i. 13.]\r\n  thy herte than with thy mouth. _Regum primo. Anna                 52\r\n  loquebatur in corda._ Anna spake with the harte.\r\n\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: [Fol. 82_b_.]]\r\n  166. A meane to put away ydle thoughtes in prayinge.\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: Against idle thoughts.]\r\n  And to auoyde wauerynge myndes, in worldlye occupations\r\n  whanne thou shalte praye, I shall shewe vnto you\r\n  the beste experience that euer I coulde fynde for the same,\r\n  the whiche haue benne moche troubled therwith, and that            4\r\n      [Sidenote: If you understand Latin, keep your eye on the\r\n       book, and remember the English of it.]\r\n  is this. He that can rede and vnderstande latyne, let\r\n  hym take his booke in his hande, and looke stedfastely\r\n  vppon the same thynge that he readeth and seeth, that\r\n  8 is no trouble to hym, and remembre the englysshe of              8\r\n  the same, wherin he shall fynde greatte swetenes, and shall\r\n  cause his mynde to folowe the same, and to leaue other\r\n  worldly thoughtes. And he that canne-not reade nor\r\n      [Sidenote: If not, think of Christ’s passion,]\r\n  vnderstande his pater noster, Aue, nor Crede, he must             12\r\n  remembre the passyon of Christe, what peyne he suffered\r\n  for hym, and all mankynde, for redemynge of theyr soules.\r\n  And also the miracles and wonders that god hath doone,\r\n  and fyrste what wonders were doone the nyghte of his              16\r\n      [Sidenote: and of His miracles;]\r\n  natiuitie and byrthe. And howe he turned water in-to\r\n  wyne, and made the blynde to se, the dombe to speake,\r\n  the deafe to here, the lame to go, the sycke to be hole.\r\n      [Sidenote: [Fol. 83.]]\r\n  And howe he fed fyue thousande with two fysshes, and              20\r\n  fyue barley loues, wherof was lefte .xii. coffyns or skyppes\r\n  of fragmentes. And howe he reised Lazare from deathe\r\n  to lyfe, with manye moo myracles that be innumerable to\r\n  be rehersed. And also to remembre the specyall poyntes            24\r\n      [Sidenote: how He was betrayed,]\r\n  of his passion, howe he was solde & betrayed of Judas,\r\n  and taken by the iewes, and broughte before Pylate, than\r\n  to kynge Herode, and to bysshope Cayphas, and than to\r\n  Pylate agayne, that iudged hym to death, and howe he              28\r\n      [Sidenote: scourged,]\r\n  was bounde to a piller, and how they scurged, bobbed,\r\n  mocked hym, spytte in his face, crowned hym with thornes,\r\n  and caused hym to beare the crosse to the mounte of\r\n      [Sidenote: and crucified;]\r\n  Caluary, whervppon he was nayled both handes and                  32\r\n  fete, and wounded to the harte with a sharpe spere, and\r\n      [Sidenote: went down to hell; and rose again.]\r\n  soo suffered deathe. And howe he fette out the soules of\r\n  our forefathers forthe of hell. Howe he rose frome deathe\r\n  to lyfe, and howe ofte he appered to his discyples and            36\r\n  other moo. And what myracles he wroughte afterwarde,\r\n  and specyally what power he gaue to his dyscyples, that\r\n  were noo clerkes, to teache and preche his faythe, and\r\n  worke many myracles, and specyally whan they preached             40\r\n  before menne of dyuers nations and languages, and euerye\r\n      [Sidenote: [Fol. 83_b_.]]\r\n  man vnderstode in theyr own language, the whiche is\r\n  a sygne that god wolde haue euery manne saued, and\r\n  to knowe his lawes, the whiche was a myracle able to              44\r\n  conuerte all the infydeles, heretykes, and lollers in the\r\n  worlde.\r\n\r\n\r\n  167. ¶ A meane to auoyde temptation.\r\n\r\n  It is ofte-tymes seen, that the holyer that a man is, the\r\n      [Sidenote: The holier a man is, the more he is tempted.]\r\n  more he is tempted, and he that soo is, maye thanke god\r\n  therof. For god of his goodnes and grace hath not gyuen\r\n  to the dyuell auctoritie nor power to attempte any man             4\r\n  ferther and aboue that, that he that is so tempted, maye\r\n  withstande. For sayncte Gregory sayth, _Non est timendum_\r\n      [Sidenote: Gregory.]\r\n  (sic) _hostis, qui non potest vincere nisi volente_m. An enemye is\r\n  not to be dradde, the whiche maye not ouercome, but if a           8\r\n  manne be wyllynge. And it is to presume, that he that is\r\n  soo tempted, standeth in the state of grace. For sayncte\r\n  Ambrose saythe, _Illos diabolus[34] vexare negligit, quos iure\r\n      [Sidenote: Ambrose.]\r\n  hæreditario se possidere sentit_. The dyuell despyseth to         12\r\n  vexe or trouble those, the whiche he felethe him-selfe to\r\n  haue in possessyon by ryght inheritaunce. And if thou\r\n  be so tempted, vexed, or troubled, I shall shewe vnto the\r\n      [Sidenote: [Fol. 84.]]\r\n  two verses, that if thou do therafter, thou shalte be eased       16\r\n  of thy temptacyon, and haue greatte thanke and laude of\r\n  god and rewarde therfore; these be the verses.\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: Two useful verses.]\r\n        _Hostis no_n _ledit, nisi cum te_m_ptatus obedit._\r\n        _Est leo si sedit, si stat quasi musca recedit._             20\r\n\r\n  ¶ That is to say, The gostly enemy hurteth not, but whan\r\n      [Sidenote: The tempter is a lion, if we sit still;]\r\n  he that is tempted obeyeth to his temptation. Than his\r\n  ghostly enemy plaieth the lyon, if that he that is so\r\n  tempted syt styll and obey to hym. And if he that is              24\r\n      [Sidenote: but if we resist, he is but a fly.]\r\n  tempted, stande styfly agaynste hym, the ghostlye ennemye\r\n  flyeth awaye lyke a flye. This me semeth maye be wel\r\n  proued by a famylier ensaumple. As if a lorde had a\r\n      [Sidenote: A fainthearted captain loses his castle,]\r\n  castell, and deliuered it to a capitayne to kepe, if there        28\r\n  come ennemies to the castell, and call to the capytayn,\r\n  and byd hym delyuer them this castell. The capytayne\r\n  cometh and openeth them the gates, and delyuereth the\r\n  keyes. Nowe is this castell soone wonne, and this                 32\r\n     [Sidenote: and is a traitor. But if he resist, the enemy\r\n      will not tarry.]\r\n  capytayne is a false traytour to the lorde. But lette\r\n  the capitaine arme hym-selfe, and steke the gates, and\r\n  stande styfly vpon the walle, and commaunde them to\r\n  auoyde at theyr peryll, and they wyll not tary to make            36\r\n      [Sidenote: Every man is captain of his own soul.]\r\n      [Sidenote: [Fol. 84_b_.]]\r\n  any assaut. Ryght so euery man is capitayne of his owne\r\n  soule, and if thy gostely ennemy come and tempte the,\r\n  and thou, that art capytayne of thyne owne soule, wyll\r\n  open the gates, and delyuer hym the keyes and let hym             40\r\n  in, thy sowle is soone taken prysoner, and thou a false\r\n  traytour to thy soule, and worthye to be punysshed in\r\n  pryson for euer. And if thou arme thy-selfe and stande\r\n  styfly agaynste hym, and wyll not consente to hym, he             44\r\n  wyll auoyde and fle away, and thou shalt haue a greate\r\n  reward for withstandynge of the sayde temptation.\r\n\r\n\r\n  168. ¶ Almes-dedes pleaseth god moche.\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: Almsdeeds.]\r\n  Almes-dedes pleseth god very moche, and it is great\r\n  sygne that thou loueste bothe god and thy neyghboure.\r\n  And he of whome almes is asked, oughte to consyder\r\n  thre thynges, that is to saye, who asketh almes, what he           4\r\n      [Sidenote: God asketh.]\r\n  asketh, and wherevnto he asketh. Nowe to the fyrste,\r\n  who asketh almes, _Deus petit_. God asketh. For saynte\r\n      [Sidenote: Jerome.]\r\n  Jerome sayth, _Quia deus adeo diligit pauperes, quod quicquid\r\n  fit eis propter amorem suum, reputat sibi factum_. That is         8\r\n  to saye, bycause that god loueth poore men so moche,\r\n      [Sidenote: [Fol. 85.]]\r\n  what-someuer thynge is gyuen vnto them for the loue of\r\n  hym, he taketh it as it were done to hym-selfe; as it is\r\n      [Sidenote: Matt. xxv. 15.]\r\n  sayde in his gospell, _Quod vni ex minimis meis fecistis,         12\r\n  michi fecistis_. That thynge that ye gyue or do to the\r\n  least of those that be myne, ye do it to me. Thanne to\r\n      [Sidenote: He asks not ours, but his.]\r\n  the seconde, what asketh god? _Non nostrum, sed suum._ He\r\n  asketh not that thynge that is ours, but that thynge that is      16\r\n  his owne. As saythe the prophete Dauid, _Tua sunt domine\r\n  omnia: Et quæ de manu tua accepimus, tibi dedimus_. Good\r\n  lorde, all thynges be thyne, and those thynges that we\r\n  haue taken of the, of those haue we gyuen the. Thanne             20\r\n      [Sidenote: He asks only to borrow, and to repay a\r\n       hundredfold.]\r\n  to the thyrde, Where-vnto dothe god aske? He asketh\r\n  not to gyue hym, but all-onely to borowe, _Non tamen ad\r\n  triplas, s[c]ilicet, immo ad centuplas_. Not all-onely to haue\r\n  thryse soo moche, but forsothe to haue an hundred tymes           24\r\n      [Sidenote: Augustine.]\r\n  soo moche. As saynt Austyn saythe, _Miser homo, quid\r\n  veneraris homini; venerare deo, et centuplum accipies, et vitam\r\n  æternam possidebis?_ Thou wretched manne, why doste thou\r\n  worshyp or dreade manne: worshyp thou god and dreade              28\r\n  hym, and thou shalte receyue an hundred tymes so moche,\r\n  and haue in possessyon euerlastynge lyfe, the whiche many-folde\r\n      [Sidenote: [Fol. 85_b_.]]\r\n  passeth all other rewardes? Prouerbiorum xiiii.\r\n  _Veneratur domino,[35] qui miseretur pauperibus_: He worshyppeth  32\r\n      [Sidenote: Prov. xix. 7.]\r\n  our lorde, that hath mercye and pytye on poore\r\n  folkes. And the glose therof sayth, _Centuplum accepturus_.\r\n  And thou shalte receyue an .C. tymes so moche. And it\r\n      [Sidenote: Three kinds of alms-deeds.]\r\n  is to be vnderstande, that there be thre maner of almes-dedes,    36\r\n  that is to saye: _Egenti largire quicquid poteris:\r\n  dimittere eis a quibus lesus fueris: Errantem corrigere, et in\r\n  viam veritatis reducere._ That is to saye, to gyue to the\r\n  nedy what thou well mayste, to forgyue theym that haue            40\r\n  trespaced to the, and to correcte them that do amysse,\r\n  and to brynge them into the way of ryghte.\r\n\r\n\r\n  169. ¶ The fyrste maner of almes.\r\n\r\n  _Egenti largire quicquid poteris._ Gyue to the nedye what\r\n      [Sidenote: Luke xi. 41 vi. 38.]\r\n  thou well maye. For our lorde saythe in his gospell: _Date\r\n  elemosinam, et omnia munda sunt vobis. Et alibi. Date, et\r\n  dabitur vobis_: Gyue almes, and all worldly rychesse is            4\r\n  yours; gyue, and it shall be gyuen to you. Almes-dede\r\n  is a holy thynge, it encreaseth a mans welthe, it maketh\r\n  lesse a mannes synnes, it lengtheth a mans lyfe, it maketh\r\n      [Sidenote: [Fol. 86.]]\r\n  a man of good mynde, it delayeth yll tymes, and closeth            8\r\n  all thynges, hit delyuereth a manne from deathe, it ioyneth\r\n  a manne with aungelles, and seuereth hym from the dyuell,\r\n  and is lyke a wall vnable to be foughten agaynst. And\r\n  saynt James saythe: _Sicut aqua extinguit ignem, ita elemosina    12\r\n  peccatum._ As water slecketh fyer, soo dothe almes-dede\r\n      [Sidenote: Prov. xxviii. 27.]\r\n  slake synne. Salomon saythe, _Qui dat pauperi, non\r\n  indigebit._ He that giueth vnto a poore man, shal neuer\r\n      [Sidenote: Prov. xxi. 13.]\r\n  haue nede. And also he sayth, _Qui obturat aurem suam             16\r\n  ad clamorem pauperis, et ipse clamabit, et non exaudietur._\r\n  He that stoppeth his eare at the clamoure or crie of a\r\n  pore man, he shall crye, and he shall not be gracyousely\r\n  herde. There maye no manne excuse hym from gyuynge                20\r\n  of almes, thoughe he be poore. And let hym doo as\r\n      [Sidenote: Mark, xii. 42;]\r\n      [Sidenote: Luke, xxi. 2.]\r\n  the poore wydowe dyd, that offered a farthynge, wherfore\r\n  she hadde more thanke and rewarde of god, thanne the\r\n  ryche men that offered golde. And if thou mayste not              24\r\n  gyue a farthynge, gyue lesse, or gyue fayre wordes, or\r\n  good information, ensaumple, and token: and god shall\r\n  rewarde the bothe for thy dede and for thy good wyll. And\r\n  that thou dooste, do it with a good wyll. For saynte              28\r\n      [Sidenote: 2 Cor. ix. 7.]\r\n  Paule saythe, _Hilarem datorem diligit deus_. God loueth\r\n      [Sidenote: [Fol. 86_b_.]]\r\n  a glad gyuer, and that if it be of true begotten goodes.\r\n  For Salomon saythe, _De tuis iustis laboribus ministra\r\n  pauperibus_. Of thy trewe labours mynystre and gyue to            32\r\n      [Sidenote: Isidore.]\r\n  the poore folkes. For Isodorus saythe, _Qui iniuste tollit,\r\n  iuste nunquam tribuit_. He that taketh wrongfully, cannot\r\n  gyue trewelye. For it is wrytten Ecclesiastici xxxv.\r\n      [Sidenote: Eccles. xxxiv. 24.]\r\n  _Qui de rapinis, aut vsuris, aut de furto immolat: e[s]t quasi    36\r\n  qui coram patre victimat filium._ He that offereth of the\r\n  goodes, that he getteth by extortyon, vsurye, or thefte,\r\n  he is lyke as a man slewe the sonne in the presence of\r\n  the father. Thou mayste ryghte well knowe, the father             40\r\n  wolde not be well contente. Noo more wolde god be\r\n  pleased with the gyfte of suche begotten goodes.\r\n\r\n\r\n  170. ¶ The seconde maner of almes.\r\n\r\n  _Dimittere eis, a quibus lesus fueris._ To forgyue theym\r\n  that haue trespaced to the, wherin thou shalte please\r\n  god moche. For it is in the gospell of sayncte Marke\r\n      [Sidenote: Mark, xi. 6.]\r\n  .xii. _Si non dimiseritis aliis, nec pater vester celestis dimittet  4\r\n   vobis peccata vestra._ If you forgyue not, your father of\r\n      [Sidenote: [Fol. 87.]]\r\n  heuen wyll not forgyue you your synnes. Also if thou\r\n  doo not forgyue other, thou shalte be founde a lyer, as\r\n  ofte as thou sayeste thy _Pater noster_, where thou sayste:        8\r\n      [Sidenote: Matt. vi. 12.]\r\n  _Et dimitte nobis debita nostra, sicut et nos dimittimus debitoribus\r\n  nostris._ And forgyue to vs our dettes, as we forgyue\r\n  to our detters. By these dettes maye be vnderstande the\r\n  thynges that we oughte to do to god, and doo not them.            12\r\n  And also the trespaces and the synne that we haue\r\n  offended to god, in that we aske mercye of. And if\r\n  thou wylte not forgyue, thou mayst not aske mercy of\r\n      [Sidenote: Matt. vii. 2.]\r\n  ryght. _Eadem mensura, qua mensi fueritis, remetietur vobis._     16\r\n  The same measure that ye meate other men by, shall be\r\n  moten vnto you. _Dimittere autem rancorem et maliciam\r\n  omnino necessitatis est, dimittere vero actionem et emendam\r\n  opus est consilii._ To forgyue all rancour and malyce, that       20\r\n  a manne oweth to the in his harte, thou arte bounden\r\n  of necessitie to forgyue all the hole trespace, or to leaue\r\n  thyne actyon, or a reasonable mendes. Therfore it is\r\n  but a dede of mercye if thou so do, and no synne though           24\r\n  thou sue the lawe with charytie. But and a manne haue\r\n  done to the a trespace, and that thou arte gladde that\r\n      [Sidenote: [Fol. 87_b_.]]\r\n  he hathe soo done, that thou mayste haue a quarell, or\r\n  a matter, or an accyon agaynste hym, and nowe of malyce           28\r\n  or yll wyll thou wylte sue hym, rather than for the\r\n  trespace; nowe thou synnest dedely, bycause thou doest\r\n  rather of malyce than for the trespace, and than haste\r\n      [Sidenote: Prov. xxii. 9.]\r\n  thou loste thy charitie, Prouerbiorum .xxxii. _Qui pronus         32\r\n  est ad misericordiam, benedicetur._ He that is redy to forgiue,\r\n  shall be blessed.\r\n\r\n\r\n  171. ¶ The thyrde maner of almes.\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: Three ways of correction.]\r\n  _Errantem corrigere, et in viam veritatis reducere._ To\r\n  correcke a misdoer, and to brynge hym into the waye of\r\n  ryghte. It is to be vnderstand, that there be thre maner\r\n  of corrections.                                                    4\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: First, as an enemy.]\r\n  ¶ The fyrste correction is of an ennemye, the seconde\r\n  is of a frynde, and the thyrde correction is of a Iustyce.\r\n      [Sidenote: Chrysostom.]\r\n  The fyrste saythe Chrisostome, _Corripe non vt hostis\r\n  expetens vindictam, sed vt medicus instituens medicinam_.          8\r\n  Correcke not as an enemye doinge vengeaunce, but as\r\n      [Sidenote: Secondly, as a friend.]\r\n  a phisicyon or surgyon, mynistringe or gyuynge a medicyne.\r\n  To the seconde saythe Salomon. _Plus proficit\r\n  amica correctio, quam correctio turbulenta._ A frendelye          12\r\n      [Sidenote: [Fol. 88.]]\r\n  correction profyteth more than a troublous correction.\r\n  For yf thou speke courteysly to a man that hath offended,\r\n  and with sweete wordes of compassion, he shall rather\r\n  be conuerted by theym, than with hye wordes of great              16\r\n      [Sidenote: Isidore.]\r\n  punysshement. And Isodorus saythe, _Qui per verba blanda\r\n  castigatus non corrigetur, acrius necesse est, vt arguatur_.\r\n  He that wylle not be chastysed by fayre wordes, it is\r\n  necessary that he be more hardlyer and straytlyer reproued        20\r\n      [Sidenote: Jerome.]\r\n  or punysshed. To the thyrde saythe sayncte Ierome,\r\n  _Equum iudicium est, vbi non persona sed opera considerantur_.\r\n      [Sidenote: Thirdly, as a judge.]\r\n  There is an euen Iugemente, where the personne is not\r\n  regarded, but the warkes are consydered. And alsoo hit            24\r\n      [Sidenote: Matt. xvi. 27.]\r\n  is wrytten. _Reddet vnicuique iuxta opera sua._ He shall\r\n  yelde vnto euery manne after his workes. And sayncte\r\n      [Sidenote: Augustine.]\r\n  Augustyne saythe, _Sicut meliores sunt, quos corrigit amor,\r\n  ita plures sunt quos corrigit timor_. As those be better,         28\r\n  that be chastysed by loue, soo there be many moo that\r\n  be chastysed by feare. For and they feared not the\r\n  punyshement of the lawe, there wolde be but a fewe\r\n      [Sidenote: Gregory.]\r\n  chastysed by loue. And saynte Gregory sayth, _Facientis           32\r\n  procul dubio culpam habet, qui quod potest corrigere negligit\r\n      [Sidenote: [Fol. 88_b_.]]\r\n  emendare, et illicita non prohibere consensus erroris est_. He\r\n  that maye correcke, and dothe not, he taketh the offence\r\n  to hym-selfe of the dede; and he that dothe not forbede           36\r\n  vnlawefull thynges, consenteth to the same, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n  172. ¶ What is the greattest offence that a manne may doo\r\n  and offende god in.\r\n\r\n  In myne opynyon, it is to be in despayre of the mercye\r\n  of god. And therefore what soo euer thou haue doone\r\n  or offended god, in worde, warke, thought, or dede, be\r\n      [Sidenote: Isidore.]\r\n  neuer in despayre for it; for Isodorus saythe, _Qui veniam         4\r\n  de peccato desperat, plus de desperatione peccat quam de culpa\r\n  cadit_. He that despayreth to haue forgyuenes of his\r\n  synnes, he synneth more in despayrynge than he dyd in\r\n      [Sidenote: Jerome.]\r\n  the synne doynge. For saynte Iherome sayth, _Magis                 8\r\n  offendebat Iudas deum in hoc quod suspendebat, quam in\r\n  hoc, quod eum tradidit_: Judas offended god more in\r\n  that that he hanged hym-selfe, than he dydde whanne he\r\n      [Sidenote: Ezek. xxxiii. 11.]\r\n  betrayed god. For god sayth in his gospell, _Nolo mortem          12\r\n  peccatoris, sed magis vt conuertatur et viuat_. I wyll not the\r\n      [Sidenote: [Fol. 89.]]\r\n  deathe of a synner, but rather that he maye be conuerted\r\n      [Sidenote: Luke v. 32.]\r\n  and lyue. And also he saythe, _Non veni vocare iustos,\r\n  sed peccatores ad penitentiam_. I am not comen to call            16\r\n  ryghtwyse men, but to call synners to do penaunce.\r\n  For thou canste not so soone crye god mercy with thy\r\n  harte, but he is as redye to chaunge his sentence, and to\r\n  graunte the mercy and forgyuenes of all thy synnes. For           20\r\n      [Sidenote: Augustine.]\r\n  saynte Austyne saythe, _Sicut scintilia [sic] ignis in medio\r\n  maris, sic omnis impietas viri ad misericordiam dei_. As a\r\n  sparke of fyer is in comparison able to drye vppe all the\r\n  water in the se, noo more is all the wyckednes of man             24\r\n  vnto the me[r]cyfulnes of god. And therfore it is conuenyent\r\n  that a manne shulde be penytent, contryte, and aske\r\n  god mercye and forgyuenesse of his synnes and offences,\r\n      [Sidenote: Chrysostom.]\r\n  that he hath done; wherof speketh Chrysost[o]me, _Nemo            28\r\n  ad deum aliquando flens accessit quod non postulauerit accepit_.\r\n  No man hath gone any tyme wepynge to god, but he\r\n  hath taken or had that thynge that he hath asked. And\r\n      [Sidenote: Bernard.]\r\n  sayncte Bernarde saythe, _Plus cruciant lacrime peccatoris        32\r\n  diabolum quam omne genus tormentorum_. The teares of a\r\n  synner tourmenteth the deuyll more, than all other kyndes\r\n      [Sidenote: Augustine.]\r\n  of turmentes. And sayncte Austyne saythe, _Acriores\r\n      [Sidenote: [Fol. 89_b_.]]\r\n  dolores demonibus non inferrimus, q_uam _cum peccata nostra       36\r\n  penitendo et confitendo plangimus_. We canne not doo more\r\n  sharper sorowes to the dyuell, than whan we wayle or\r\n  wepe in confessyon, and doynge of penaunce. And\r\n      [Sidenote: Mary Magdalen.]\r\n  that maye be well proued by Mary Magdaleyn,                       40\r\n  whanne she kneled downe and cryed god mercye, and\r\n  kyste his fete, and wasshed theym with the teares of\r\n  her eyen, and wyped them with the heare of her\r\n  heed, to whom our lorde sayde, as in his gospell,                 44\r\n      [Sidenote: Luke vii. 48.]\r\n  _Dimittuntur tibi peccata tua_. Thy synnes are forgyuen\r\n      [Sidenote: Luke vii. 50.]\r\n  to the; and also he sayde to her: _Fides te saluam fecit,\r\n  vade in pace_. Thy faythe hath saued the, goo thou in\r\n  peace. To the whiche mercy and peace I besech                     48\r\n  almyghty Iesu brynge all chrysten soules. Amen.\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: The author’s protestation.]\r\n  Be it knowen to all men bothe spirytuall and temporall,\r\n  that I make protestacion before god and man,\r\n  that I entende not to wryte any-thynge that is or                 52\r\n  maye be contrary to the faythe of Chryste and al holy\r\n  churche.

R. in 1598. See the Preface.\r\n\r\nThe references are to the _Sections_ and _lines_, as numbered.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n=Prologue=; lines 2, 6. See Job, v. 7; 2 Thess. iii. 10.\r\n\r\n15. The allusion is to Caxton’s Book of the Chess; see the\r\ndescription of it in Ames’ Typographical Antiquities, ed. Dibdin,\r\ni. 36, where woodcuts will be found representing the several pieces.\r\n\r\n20. _iudges._ Caxton calls them _rooks_, as at present, but he\r\ndescribes them as being vicars and legates of the king, i.e. as\r\noccupying the position of judges.\r\n\r\n_yomenne_, pawns. In Caxton, we find the division of pawns into\r\neight classes (answering to the eight pawns on each side), in\r\nwhich the king’s rook’s pawn represents the _husbandman_. The next\r\nin order, the king’s knight’s pawn, is the _smith_; after which,\r\nin due order, we find the _notary_, _merchant_, _physician_,\r\n_taverner_, _guard_ (or watchman), and the _ribald_ or dice-player,\r\nwhose character is not well spoken of. This eight-fold division\r\nseems to me to have suggested the well-known formula which\r\ndivides men into the eight classes of ‘soldier, sailor, tinker,\r\ntailor, gentleman, apothecary, ploughboy, thief;’ which is\r\nsometimes otherwise varied. The German formula is. ‘Edelmann,\r\nBettelman, Amtmann, Pastor, Kaufmann, Laufmann, Maler, Major;’\r\nalso, be it observed, eight-fold. Our soldier, tinker, tailor,\r\napothecary, ploughboy, and thief, may be imagined to correspond,\r\nwith sufficient exactitude, to Caxton’s guard, smith, merchant,\r\nphysician, husbandman, and ribald.\r\n\r\n27. _Remytte_, leave. A word is evidently omitted; we must supply\r\n_to_ after _as_, or else substitute _to_ for _as_. In the Book of\r\nSurveying, ch. ix, we find, “I remytte that to menne of lawe;” and\r\nagain, in ch. xii, “I remytte all those poyntes to menne of lawe.”\r\nSee also sect. 7, l. 14.\r\n\r\n=1.= 1. For the manner in which I. R. rewrites this section, see\r\nthe Preface.\r\n\r\n=2.= 5. _Chylturne._ As to the sense, we find, in the Book of\r\nSurveying, c. 37, the following. “Chylturne grounde and flyntye\r\ngrounde be light groundes and drye, and full of small stones, and\r\nchalke grounde is moche of the same nature, and they wyll weare and\r\nwashe awaye with water.”\r\n\r\n6. _Meane erthe_, earth of ordinary character. _Mean_ is moderate,\r\nordinary. I. R. alters it to ‘_maine_ earth,’ which was probably\r\nnot intended. After _marle_, he inserts--“some neither Sand nor\r\nClay, but like a mixture of both, yet neither, which is called a\r\nHassell ground.”\r\n\r\n9. I. R. has--“In Sommerset-shiere, Dawset-shiere, and\r\nGloster-shiere.”\r\n\r\n_Zelcester._ The old character Ʒ, which had the force of _y_ at\r\nthe beginning of a word,[36] was often printed as Z, by confusion.\r\nBishop Percy used to print such ludicrous forms as _zow_,\r\n_zour_, instead of _yow_, _your_. I conclude that _Zelcester_ =\r\n_Yelcester_, _i.e._ Ilchester. The form occurs again in sect. 27,\r\nl. 17.\r\n\r\n16. _many other places._ J. R. says--“in some parte of\r\nHartford-shiere, Sussex, and Cornwall.”\r\n\r\n24. _aslope_] I. R. has _a flote_, _gyue out_, i.e. spread out, are\r\ntoo obtuse.\r\n\r\n26. I. R. says--“In Cambridge-shiere, Huntington-shiere,\r\nBedford-shiere, and for the most part of Northamton-shiere, theyr\r\nPloughes haue but one hale. In Leister-shiere, Lankishiere,\r\nYorkshiere, Lincolnshiere, and Notingham-shiere, they haue two; for\r\nall other Countries [_counties_] vnnamed, there is none of them but\r\nplow with some of these Ploughes before-mentioned.”\r\n\r\n=3.= 1. The parts of a plough are enumerated in Gervase Markham’s\r\nComplete Husbandman (1614), which is quoted at length in Rogers’s\r\nHist. of Agriculture and Prices, vol. i. p. 534. It is probable\r\nthat the plough, as described by Fitzherbert, did not materially\r\ndiffer from that in use in 1614.\r\n\r\nThe principal parts, according to Markham, are as follows.\r\n\r\n(1). ‘The _ploughbeam_, a large and long piece of timber, which\r\nforms an arch for the other parts of the plough.’ It is, says\r\nFitzherbert, the long beam above, which is slightly bent. The\r\nplough-sheath, the coulter, and the plough-foot, are all mortised\r\ninto it, pointing downwards.\r\n\r\n(2). ‘The _skeath_ (i.e. _sheath_), a piece of wood two and a half\r\nfeet long, eight inches broad, and two inches thick, which is\r\nmortised into the beam, and sloping forwards below it.’ Fitzherbert\r\nsays it is a thin piece of dry oak, fixed both in the plough-beam\r\nand the share-beam, and is the chief ‘band,’ i.e. strengthening\r\npiece or support, of the whole plough. By ‘thin,’ he must mean that\r\nit is thin (2 inches) in proportion to its breadth (8 inches);\r\nit is necessary that it should be very strong, as it holds the\r\nimplement together.\r\n\r\n(3). ‘The plough’s _principal hale_ on the left hand, a long bent\r\npiece of wood, somewhat strong in the midst, and so slender at the\r\nupper end that a man may easily gripe it.’ This is Fitzherbert’s\r\n_plough-tail_ (l. 16), which he says is mortised into the sharebeam\r\nbehind, and pinned to the ploughbeam behind also. The ploughman\r\nholds it in his _left_ hand. It is also called the _ploughstart_;\r\nwhere _start_ means _tail_, as in _red-start_.\r\n\r\n(4). ‘The _plough-head_, which is fixed with the skeath and the\r\nhale, all at one instant, into two several mortise-holes; a\r\nflat piece of timber, about three feet in length, seven inches\r\nin breadth, and two and a half in thickness, and having two\r\nnicks towards the head of the plough.’ This is the same as what\r\nFitzherbert calls the _sharebeam_; see the explanation in sect. 2,\r\nl. 10.\r\n\r\n(5). ‘The _plough-spindles_, two round pieces of wood which couple\r\nthe hales [handles] together.’ These are what Fitzherbert calls the\r\n_rough staves_; see l. 35.\r\n\r\n(6). ‘The _right-hand hale_, through which the other end of the\r\nspindles run, much more slender than the left-hand hale, because no\r\nforce is put on it.’ This is Fitzherbert’s _plough-stilt_; see l.\r\n21.\r\n\r\n(7). The _plough-rest_, a small piece of wood, fixed at one end\r\nin the further nick of the plough-head, and on the other end to\r\nthe right-hand hale.’ ‘In the Middle Ages,’ says Prof. Rogers,\r\n‘it appears that this part was made of iron, and that it was\r\noccasionally double.’ We must remember that _plough-head_ means the\r\n_sharebeam_.\r\n\r\n(8). ‘The _shelboard_ [i.e. shield-board], a board of more than an\r\ninch thick, covering the right side of the plough, and fastened\r\nwith two strong wooden pins to the skeath and right-hand hale.’\r\n\r\n(9). ‘The _coulter_, a long piece of iron made sharp at one end,\r\npassing on one side by a mortise-hole through the beam, and held in\r\nplace by an iron ring which winds round the beam and strengthens\r\nit.’ Fitzherbert’s description is slightly different; see l. 48.\r\nThe use of the coulter is to make the first incision into the\r\nearth; it precedes the share, which follows it and completes its\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n(10). ‘The _share_. If this be needed for a mixed earth, it is made\r\nwithout a wing, or with a small one only: if, however, it be needed\r\nfor a deep or stiff clay, it should be made with a large wing or an\r\nouter point.’\r\n\r\n(11). ‘The _plough-foot_. This is an iron implement, passed through\r\na mortise-hole, and fastened at the farther end of the beam by a\r\nwedge or two, so that the husbandman may at his discretion set it\r\nhigher or lower; the use being to give the plough earth or to put\r\nit from the earth, for the more it is driven downward the more it\r\nraises the beam from the ground and makes the irons forsake the\r\nearth, and the more it is driven upward, the more it lets down\r\nthe beam and makes the irons bite the ground.’ Fitzherbert well\r\ndescribes it as ‘a stay to order of what deepness the plough shall\r\ngo.’ The word _ploughfote_ occurs in Piers Plowman, B. vi. 105; see\r\nmy notes to that poem, vol. iv. p. 161. This part of the plough\r\nwas also called a _plough-shoe_ (in Latin, _ferripedalis_); see\r\nRogers (as above), p. 538. In a modern plough, the plough-foot is\r\ngenerally replaced by small wheels. I may remark that it was placed\r\nin front, before the coulter.\r\n\r\nIf we compare the preceding account with that given by\r\nFitzherbert, we shall see that the two nearly agree. Fitzherbert’s\r\n_plough-beam_, _plough-sheath_, and _plough-tail_ are Nos. 1, 2,\r\nand 3 above; his _stilt_, _rest_, and _shieldboard_ are Nos. 6, 7,\r\nand 8; his _rough staves_, _plough-foot_, _share_, and _coulter_,\r\nare Nos. 5, 11, 10, and 9. But he has three additional terms,\r\nviz. the _sharebeam_, which is the wooden frame for the _share_,\r\nand is called by Markham the _plough-head_ (No. 4). Secondly, the\r\n_fen-board_, i.e. _mud-board_, covering the _left_ side of the\r\nplough, and fastened to the _left_ of the sheath and the _left_\r\nhale, much as the shield-board is fastened to the _right_ of the\r\nsheath and the _right_ hale. Lastly, the _plough-ear_, defined\r\nas ‘three pieces of iron, nailed fast to the right side of the\r\nplough-beam,’ for which poor men substituted ‘a crooked piece of\r\nwood pinned fast to the plough-beam.’ What was the use of this\r\nappendage we are not expressly told; but it seems to have been used\r\nfor fastening the trace to, for draught; see =4.= 34.\r\n\r\nFitzherbert also notices the _plough-mal_, i.e. plough-mall or\r\nplough-mallet (l. 55), which seems to have consisted of a head of\r\nhard wood and a ‘pynne,’ or handle, and to have been loosely stuck\r\ninto the plough-beam by passing the handle through ‘an augurs\r\nbore,’ i.e. through a hole bored in the beam by an augur for this\r\nespecial purpose. This was no real _part_ of the plough, but only a\r\ntool conveniently kept at hand. He does not, however, mention the\r\nplough-staff (or akerstaff), which was ‘a pole shod with a flat\r\niron, the purpose of which was to clear the mould-board from any\r\nstiff earth which might cling to it while the plough was at work’;\r\nRogers, as above, p. 539. This was originally held in the right\r\nhand (see my notes to P. Plowman); but I think it likely that, when\r\na second handle, or _stilt_, came into use, the plough-staff was\r\ngiven up. Wright’s Prov. Glossary gives “_mell_, _mellet_, a square\r\npiece of wood fitted with a handle, a mallet.”\r\n\r\n10. I. R. says of the _sharbeame_, that “in some Countries it is\r\ncalled the plough-head.” Fitzherbert has already said this, see\r\n=2.= 10.\r\n\r\n12. _Oke_] Oake or Ashe; I.R.\r\n\r\n15. I. R. says of the _plough-tayle_, that “in many Countries [it\r\nis] called the Plough-hale, of which they haue two, but the other\r\nis fastened to the rough staues and the shelboard.” The other\r\n_hale_ is the _plough-stilt_.\r\n\r\n25. _sheldbrede_] Shelboard; I. R.\r\n\r\n27. _fenbrede_] Senbred; I. R. This is wrong.\r\n\r\n32. _to come past_] compasse; I. R.\r\n\r\n34. _roughe_] long; I. R.\r\n\r\n49. _bende_, _i.e._ bent] broad; I. R. This is inappropriate, for\r\nit is somewhat narrow, viz. of the breadth of three inches; see\r\nline 52.\r\n\r\n55. _plough-mal_] Plough Maule; I. R. As to the parts of a plough,\r\ncf. Tusser’s Husbandry, 17. 10, 11; and see above, note to =3.= 1.\r\n\r\n=4.= 14. _slot-wedges_] flote wedges; I. R. I. R. does not seem to\r\nhave understood it, as he alters _slote_ to _flatte_ in the two\r\nlines following.\r\n\r\n19. After _erthe_, I. R. has--“so that it may, as the best\r\nexperienced Plow-men say, kill a worme, or els it goeth not truly.”\r\n_Worme_ is clearly right. He further inserts--“The poynt of your\r\nCulture, and the poynt of your Share, must runne both in one\r\nleuell, so that they may cutte both in one instant, chiefely if the\r\nground be stiffe and tough; but if it be in a light land, then if\r\nthe point of your Culture be a little longer it shall be so much\r\nthe better, and in such light groundes, let your Culture be somwhat\r\nsickell-wise bowed, for the finer cutting, but in tough Clay ground\r\nit ought to be as straight as may be.”\r\n\r\n26. _payreth_] hurteth; I. R. This is a gloss.\r\n\r\n29. _practyue_] practise; I. R.[37]\r\n\r\n33. _bende_] band. But _bende_ probably means ‘bent piece.’\r\n\r\n35. _he_] you (throughout). This shews that this idiomatic use of\r\n_he_ was obsolescent in 1598.\r\n\r\n46. _coke_] Cocke.\r\n\r\n58. I. R. adds--“In diuers Countries, as namely in Cambridgshiere,\r\nHuntington, Hartford, Bedford, and Northamton, the share is alwayes\r\nnayled with certaine nayles vnto the shelboard, to which I am not\r\nso well affected, because by that meanes the shelboard can neuer\r\nbe turnd, or after he is once worne be [_sic_] for other purpose,\r\nwhereas in the Northerne partes of this Land, the share being only\r\nfastned in his socket to the Plough-head, which may at ease be done\r\nwith a crooked horne of a Ramme, which being put ouer the poynt\r\nof the share, may be knocked fast at ones pleasure, the shelboard\r\nbeing worne at the one end may be taken off, and the other end set\r\nforward, which will as sufficiently serue as euer it did before,\r\nyeelding to the Plough-man a double profit.”\r\n\r\n=5.= 1. _But or he_] Before we.\r\n\r\n2. _geare_] implements.

I. R. adds--“yet in all _Virgils_ writing the Oxe-plough is\r\nmost preferred.” There are other unimportant variations here.\r\n\r\n17. _teddered_] teathered.\r\n\r\n18. _hades_] hadds.\r\n\r\n24. _gere that they shal_] harnes and tyer they.\r\n\r\n27. _hey_] hay mingled, which Plough-men call bendfoder.\r\n\r\n28. _and they haue, &c._] and for shooes for the most part that\r\ncost in them is saued, except it be for some long iourney, or in\r\nstony wayes for feare of surbayting.\r\n\r\n30. _lyttell worthe_] worth nothing, except for a kennell of\r\nnoyse-begetting Hounds.\r\n\r\n32. _ii._ s.] tenne shillings.\r\n\r\n=7.= I. R. omits this section altogether.\r\n\r\n=8.= I. R. greatly expands this section, after the following manner.\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 8. ¶ How a man should plough all manner of Lands all times\r\nof the yeare.\r\n\r\nNow that I haue prescribed the manner to make and temper the most\r\nor all the sorts of Ploughs, it shall next seeme expedient for me\r\nto show the manner and time of the yeare in which a man ought to\r\nPlough, and for the better vnderstanding of the ignorant, I will\r\nbegin at the beginning of the yeare, and so succeede downe-ward:\r\nAfter the feast of _Epiphanie_ it is time for a Husbandman to goe\r\nto Plough, to wit, if your ground be a stiffe and a tough clay,\r\nthen shall you begin and Plough your Pease-earth, which is, where\r\nyou had your Wheate, Rye, and Barley, the yeere before: this\r\nground being ploughed, you shall let it so lye, which is called\r\nbayting some fiue or sixe dayes, that it may receaue a frost or\r\ntwo, which frost will so lighten and deuide the earth, that when\r\nyou shall come to harrow it, it will runne to a very good mold,\r\nthat otherwise it would neuer doe. If your ground be naturally\r\nlight and sandy, then may you immediatly vpon your ploughing sowe\r\nwithout giuing your ground any bayte at all. When your Pease earth\r\nis sowne, and the Spring is creeping on: then if you will follow\r\n_Virgils_ famous principles, begin to fallow your ground which must\r\nrest that yeare. In the beginning of Lent sow your Barley upon clay\r\ngrounds, but in hote sandy grounds, if you stay a moneth or more\r\nlonger it will be much the better. At mid-sommer stirre vp a-new,\r\nthat is, Plow againe your fallow ground: & before the rising of\r\nthe North-starre, which is eleuen dayes before the _Æquinoctial\r\nAutumnal_, or the thirteenth of September, then sow your Wheate and\r\nRye, and these be the seasons and the graynes to sow, except Oates,\r\nwhich is alwayes to be vsed in like manner as Barley is. If you\r\nhaue any ley ground to fallow or breake vp for to sowe Oates vpon,\r\nthen let that be the first thing you take in hand, that the grasse\r\nand the mosse may be rot in it, and let your Plough runne a deepe\r\nsquare furrow, and in all manner of ploughing, see that your eye,\r\nyour hand, and your foote agree, and be alwaies ready one to serue\r\nanother, and to turne vp so much mold and to lay it flatte that it\r\nreare not an edge: for if it stand vp vpon an edge, the grasse and\r\nmosse can neuer kindly rotte, which being vsed as it should, is an\r\nexcellent manuring.\r\n\r\nIf you sowe Winter-corne, as eyther Wheate or Rye vpon swarth\r\nground, looke how much Corne toucheth the mosse, so much will be\r\ndrowned and cannot spring, the mosse in his owne nature dooth keepe\r\nso much wette in it selfe. In some Countries, if a man plow deepe,\r\nhee shal plough past the good ground, and so haue little Corne, but\r\nthat Country in my iudgement is not fitte for tyllage, but rather\r\nthereto to reare and breede Cattell, as Oxen, Kine, or Sheepe, or\r\nels they must goe beate their lands with Mattocks, as they doo in\r\nmany places of Cornwall, and in some places of Deuonshiere. The\r\nmanner of plowing land is in three formes: eyther they be great\r\nLands, as with high ridges and deepe furrowes, as in all the\r\nNorth parts of this Land, and in some sotherne parts also, or els\r\nflatte and plaine, without ridge or furrow, as in most parts of\r\nCambridge-shiere: or els in little Lands, no Land containing aboue\r\ntwo or three furrowes, as in Midlesex, Essex, and Hartfordshiere.\r\n\r\nFor the first, it is needfull, where the grounde is stife, tough,\r\nand binding, beeing alwaies capable of much wette, that if the\r\nLands did not lie hie, not onely would the fatnesse choake the\r\nCorne ere it could come foorth, but also the colde soaking wette,\r\nwould confound the vigor and strengthe of the seede. For the\r\nsecond, that is good where the ground is somewhat light, and giuen\r\nto barrennesse: so that what forcst [_read_ forct] vertue soeuer\r\nyou thrust into the ground, either by manure or otherwise, the Land\r\nlying flatte and plaine, shall still retaine it, not suffering it\r\nas els it would to wash away with euery shower. For the last, that\r\nis, where the grounde is both barren, cold, and stiffe: if there\r\nyou plough in large Lands, the wether and season will so binde it\r\ntogether, that the seede shall burst, but not finde any passage to\r\nsproute. Againe, such ground is subiect to much weede, besides, if\r\nyour lands should be any greater, you should neuer possibly come to\r\nweede them, eyther as they would or they should be done.\r\n\r\n=9.= I. R. alters this section, noting--“Neuer sowe Pease or Beanes\r\non a light, hote sand ground, for that will neuer beare them, but\r\nfor the Beane, the extreamest and the stiffest ground is the best.\r\nIf it bee lesse stiffe, then the mingled ware[38] is best, as Pease\r\nand Beanes well sorted. If it bee neither stiffe nor light, then\r\ncleane Pease is the best, for they wil prosper most kindliest.”\r\n\r\n13. I. R. adds--“Pease are an excellent seede, and inrich ground\r\nas much as the light manuring: which is the reason, that in many\r\nplaces of Lincoln-shiere, and els where, sowing their inam Wheate\r\nwhere theyr Pease grew, they haue the finest Corne.”\r\n\r\n=10.= 1-9. Varied by I. R.\r\n\r\n13. _kedlokes_] Kellocks (_but elsewhere_ Kedlocks).\r\n\r\n41. I. R. adds--“because the freshnes of the molde is to the seede\r\nvery comfortable.”\r\n\r\n=11.= 11. _wonders_] wonderous (which is the later form). The whole\r\nof this section is re-written, merely to alter the language.\r\nFitzherbert speaks again of ‘the seed of discretion’ in the Book of\r\nSurveying, c. 39.\r\n\r\n=12.= 8. _strykes in other places_] two Northerne strikes. And as\r\nthe measure Northward is greater, so are their Akers larger.\r\n\r\n13. _quarter_] quarter, or halfe a seame.\r\n\r\n31. _Christmasse_] Christmas, as for the most part Northward, or\r\ngenerally vpon fat clay grounds.\r\n\r\n=13.= 7. _landes_] land and the balke.\r\n\r\n18. _sprot-barleye_] sport-Barley. So also in l. 19.\r\n\r\n28. _lyke pecke-whete_] like to an eare of Wheate.\r\n\r\n40. I. R. adds--“but how so euer the season of the yeare is, that\r\nBarley naturally of it selfe is a withered, deepe, yellow Corne,\r\nthat yeldeth much bran, & but litle flower. Barley for the most\r\npart chiefly in clay grounds would be sown vnder furrow, that is, a\r\ncast or two about the Land, then ploughed, then sowne agayne, and\r\nso harrowed.”\r\n\r\n=14.= 15. I. R. adds--“These are for the most barranest Heath or\r\nforrest ground that may be, as in Darbishiere, where they call them\r\nSkeyggs, and not Oates.”\r\n\r\n*** After section =14=, I. R. introduces section =34=, to bring\r\nall the kinds of sowing together.\r\n\r\n=15.= This is section =17= in the edition of 1598.\r\n\r\n7. _moche_] bigge (which is a gloss). So also in l. 24.\r\n\r\n8. _shotes_] flores. But this can hardly be right. See below.\r\n\r\n11. _slote_] slope. But this can hardly be right. It is clear that\r\nthe right word is _slote_, with the sense of ‘cross-bar,’ the\r\n_bulls_ being the thicker bars of the harrow.\r\n\r\n13. _withe_] withy.\r\n\r\n24. _sloted and tinded_] floted and tyned.\r\n\r\n27. _about Ryppon_] in Notinghamshire and more Northward.\r\n\r\n28. _bulder-stones_] bolder-stones. Also spelt _bulder-stones_ in\r\nthe Book on Surveying, c. 40.\r\n\r\n41. _hombers_] humbers. _withed_] writhed.\r\n\r\n42. _tresses_] traces (in both places).\r\n\r\n50. _after a shoure_, &c.] with great roles of wood, which\r\n_Virgill_ much commends, and doubtless is very good after a shower\r\nof raine, to make the ground euen to mow. And note that the dryer\r\nyour Lands be when you clot them, the sooner wil your clots break,\r\nand the more mold you shall haue.\r\n\r\n=16.= 3. _for whete, &c._] on which fallowes the next yeare\r\nfollowing, you shall sow your Rye, Wheat and Barly.\r\n\r\n24. _stere_] stirre (which is a later form).\r\n\r\n35. I. R. adds--“To fallow withall, sixe Oxen, or sixe Horses are\r\nno more then sufficient.”\r\n\r\n=17.= 29. I. R. adds--“Also let not your heapes stand too long ere\r\nthey be spread, for if they doo, the goodnesse of your manure,\r\nchiefely if it take a shower of raine, will runne into the ground\r\nwhere the heape stands, and the rest when it is spread will little\r\nprofit.”\r\n\r\n29-35. I. R. makes a new section of this, headed “Chapter 20. Of\r\nthe diuers kindes of Manure, and which is the best.” It is as\r\nfollows.\r\n\r\nThere be diuers sorts of Manures, and first of those that bee\r\nworst, as Swines dunge, which Manure breedeth and bringeth vp\r\nthistles; the scourings of Hay-barnes or Corne barnes, which\r\nbringeth vp sundry weedes and quirks [quicks?]; and rotten\r\nChaffe, which diuers vse, but brings little good. The shoueling\r\nof highwayes and streetes is very good, chiefely for Barley.\r\nHorse-dunge is reasonable. The dunge of all maner of Cattel that\r\nchew the cudde is most excellent. Doues dunge for colde ground is\r\nbest of all, but it must be spred very thinne. For grounds that are\r\ngiuen to riue and chap, ashes is excellent, for they will binde and\r\nknit together. Also for such grounds it is most singular to burne\r\nthe stubble on the ground, which is worth tenne manurings: for it\r\nfatneth (saith _Virgill_) the soyle, and yeeldeth a secrete force\r\nof nourishment vnto the seede. Also, euery euill is tryed out by\r\nthe fire, and the vnprofitable moisture is forced to sweat out,\r\nit giueth a vent and passage for the iuyce that quickeneth the\r\nCorne, and it closeth the gaping vaines and holes of the earth,\r\nthrough which, eyther extreame moysture, extreame heate, or wind,\r\nwould blast the Corne. Also in Cheshiere, Lankishiere, and other\r\nCountreys, they vse for manure a kinde of blewe Marble-like earth,\r\nwhich they call Marle. This is for those Countries an excellent\r\nmanure, and though it be exceeding chargeable, yet through good\r\nneighbour-hood it quiteth the cost: for if you manure your groundes\r\nonce in seauen or twelue yeares, it is sufficient, and look how\r\nmany yeares he beareth Corne, so many yeares he will beare grasse,\r\nand that plenty. Straw layd to rot in the Winter, is good dung.\r\n\r\n30. _sholynges_; _i.e._ shovellings. Note “the _shoueling_ of\r\nhighwayes” in the extract given just above.\r\n\r\n=18.= 3. _flyte_] shift (which is a gloss). So also in l. 28.\r\n\r\n10. _kelles begonne_] kells be gone. This shews that the reading\r\n_begonne_ in the original is a misprint for _be gone_.\r\n\r\n17. _appeyreth them sore_] abateth them much.\r\n\r\n23. _goynge vppon_] treading or going upon with their feete.\r\n\r\n31. _appeyre_] abate or diminish.\r\n\r\n33. _for_] from. This shews that the old idiomatic use of _for_ (=\r\nagainst) was obsolescent in 1598.\r\n\r\n=19.= 5. _charte_] Cart. And perhaps we should read _carte_ in the\r\ntext; the meaning of _charte_ is, of course, _cart_.\r\n\r\n8. Here I. R. inserts--“And for this purpose of carrying, I take\r\nthe Horse-Cart to be best, because they be most nimble, and goe\r\nwith best speede; & if the Horses be good, they will not at any\r\ntime loose company with his neighbours.”\r\n\r\n=20.= 3. _cocledrake_] Cockell, Drake. And such should be the\r\nreading; for see ll. 13, 17.\r\n\r\n4. _darnolde_] Darnell. _gouldes_] Golds. _haudoddes_] Hadods.\r\n\r\n6. _roughe_] tough.\r\n\r\n23. _sterte_] stalke (a gloss).\r\n\r\n32. _is_] are. Fitzherbert makes _is_ agree with _one_.\r\n\r\n47. _dee-nettles_] Dee, Nettels (wrongly).\r\n\r\n=21.= 15. _in the reane_] away. I. R. omits the rest, down to\r\n_wyddre_.\r\n\r\n=22.= 10. _at-after none_] in the after-noone. But _at-after_ is an\r\nold form, signifying much the same as _after_. See Glossary.\r\n\r\n12. _beytynge_] resting. At the end of the section, I. R.\r\nadds--“For this stirring foure horses are sufficient.”\r\n\r\n=23.= 8. _wyddrynge_] withering (the later form).\r\n\r\n11. _chowe_] chewe.\r\n\r\n16. _swathe_] swaithe.\r\n\r\n17. _mane_] man (!). The sense is, I suppose, a ridge of grass,\r\nwhich is likened to a horse’s mane.\r\n\r\n20. _moldywarpe-hilles_] Mole-hills. _styckes_] sticks and stones.\r\n\r\nIn the Book on Surveying, c. 25, we are told that the best way to\r\nspread _mouldy-warpe hilles_] is by bush-harrowing.\r\n\r\n=24.= 3. _beyked_] keyked (which I suspect to be nonsense). In line\r\n12, _beykyng_ is altered to _baking_.\r\n\r\n15. _hasell and withee_] Hassell or Withy.\r\n\r\n19. _and let his warke_] wherby he shall hinder his worke.\r\n\r\n21. _and_] if (a gloss of an obsolescent conjunction). So again in\r\nsect 25, 1. 16.\r\n\r\n=25.= 7. _ouer_] vpper. See the Glossary.\r\n\r\n22. _crofote_] Crow-foote.\r\n\r\n27. After _wyll_, I. R. inserts “as they say.”\r\n\r\n32. _twon_] twined (the weak form).\r\n\r\n=26.= 5. I. R. alters this so as to give a different sense--“when\r\nit is mowne, it will be so fast bound that no man can gather it so\r\ncleane but there wil be great losse.” This is contradictory, and\r\nprobably he missed the word _not_.\r\n\r\n=27.= 17. I. R. omits the phrase--“about Zelcestre and Martok.”\r\n\r\n=28.= 13. _And whan the barley_, &c.] and when the Barley is lead\r\naway, the Land must be raked with a great Rake with yron teeth,\r\nmade fast about a mans necke with a string, and so drawne vp and\r\ndowne the Lande, or els much Barley wil be lost. If Barley or\r\nOates be layd through winde or ill weather, then it must needes\r\nbe shorne, els not. The binding of barley in sheaues is very\r\nprofitable, yet many that haue great crops will not attend so great\r\ntrouble, but as soone as it is mowne make it in cocks like hay, and\r\nso carry it home: yet must they haue good respect vnto it, for if\r\nit bee full of weede and greeues (_sic_, _for_ greenes), then must\r\nit lye till they be withered, or els it will burne in the mow.\r\n\r\n=29.= 2. _sickles_] steeles. After _staffe-hokes_, I. R. adds--“and\r\nsome mow downe with Sythes.”\r\n\r\n4. _on repes_] in reaps.\r\n\r\n11. _codde_] codds. This is a better reading.\r\n\r\n=30.= 7. _to pervse_] peruse. This early use of _peruse_ in the\r\nsense of go through, lit. use up thoroughly, should be noted. It\r\noccurs again in the Book of Surveying, capp. 19, 24; see note to\r\n33. 7.\r\n\r\n18. As to the fall of the tenth part of the angels, see my notes to\r\nP. Plowman.\r\n\r\n21. After _truely_, I. R. adds--“but how eyther of the sayings hold\r\nwith vnconscionable impropriations, adiudge the learned, let me\r\nimagine.”\r\n\r\n=31.= 3. _halfe-throne_] halfe-theame (_sic_).\r\n\r\n=32.= 5. _reke_] Reeke, stack, or houell.\r\n\r\n6. _scaffolde_] houell; and in 11. 9, 11.\r\n\r\n7. _hedged for_] hedged or paled from.\r\n\r\n11. _shepe or catel_] Sheep, Cattel, Horse, Carts, Wains, or\r\nPloughs.\r\n\r\n=33.= 3. _meane_] reasonable.\r\n\r\n4. _ebbe_] shallow.\r\n\r\n6. _reane_] raine of balke.\r\n\r\n=33.= 7. So also in the Book of Surveying, c. 24. “And if it so be,\r\nthan take thy ploughe, and begyn to plowe a forowe in the myddes of\r\nthe syde of the land, and cast it downe as yf thou shulde falowe\r\nit, and so pervse both sydes tyl the rygge be cast down, and than\r\ntake thy plough agayn, and begyn to plowe where thou dyddest plowe\r\nfyrste, and rygge all the remeynant upwarde, and so shalt thou\r\nbothe cast thy landes, and rigge them, and all at one plowyng. And\r\nthis wyl make the lande to lye rounde, the whyche is good bothe for\r\ncorne and grasse.”\r\n\r\n=34.= This is Chapter 15 in I. R.’s edition. After _rye_ (l. 2), I.\r\nR. adds--“chiefely, if your ground be rich, clayie, and cold, but\r\nif it be dry and hote, then may you stay the latter season, as till\r\nthe latter end of October.”\r\n\r\n6. After _falowe_, I. R. adds--“and plow it vnder without\r\nharrowing.”\r\n\r\n8. After _yere_, I. R. adds--“as in other places euery third yeere,\r\nfor the one haue four fieldes, the other three.”\r\n\r\n23. _whyte wheate_] Oygrane Wheate. So in l. 31 below, he has\r\n“Oygrane or white Wheate.”\r\n\r\n25. _anis_] anns; so also in l. 29, and again in ll. 33, 36, 40,\r\n42; we should rather have expected the spelling _auns_.\r\n\r\n33. _and wyll make white breed_] it yeeldeth the finest flower of\r\nall. These three sorts of Wheat must euer bee sowne eyther on the\r\nPease stubble, or on a fallow ground that is not very proud or\r\nrich, for too rich ground for these Wheats wil make them mildewe\r\nand not prosper.\r\n\r\n35. After _whyte wheate_, I. R. adds--“but they are deceaued.”\r\n\r\n38. _rudeste_] ruddiest. This is clearly the right sense.\r\n\r\n43. _flyntered_] flintred. At the end of the section I. R. adds a\r\nlong piece, as follows.\r\n\r\nLastly, there is another Wheat, which is called hole-straw Wheat;\r\nit hath the largest eare of al Wheats, the boldest Corne, and\r\nyeeldeth the most, the finest, though not the whitest floure; it\r\nis foure-square, and hath short anns; the straw is not hollow, but\r\nhath a strong pith throughout, by reason wherof in his growth no\r\nweather whatsoeuer can beare him downe, but still he will stand and\r\nprosper; his straw yeeldeth as good thatch as Reeds, a singular\r\nprofit for a Husbandman: and it is an excellent fewell to bake or\r\nbrew with, euen as good as Gorsse or Whins: Onely Cattell will not\r\neate it, nor is it good for litter; this of all Wheats is the best:\r\nthese last named are to be sowne on the fallow ground, and the\r\nbetter the ground is, the better they will prosper.\r\n\r\nWhen you sowe your Rye choose a dry season, for small wet killeth\r\nRye. Rie, as the old husbands say, will drowne in the Hopper, that\r\nis, if in the Hopper hee catch a shower, his vigor is slaine.\r\nWherfore the drier his mold, is the better, which is the cause that\r\nthe hote, dry, and light sand is onely for Rye most excellent: his\r\nmold must harrow small like a Garden-bed, for the smallest clot\r\nhindereth his comming vp; his sprout is so small and tender.\r\n\r\nHere I. R. inserts a whole chapter, as follows.\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 16.\r\n\r\n¶ How to make barraine ground bring foorth good Corne.\r\n\r\nIf thy ground be barraine and hard, yeelding nothing but ill Hay\r\nof insuing profit, then shal it be necessary for thee to vse these\r\nsecrets in Art which is most auaileable. And first for thy Pease,\r\nBeanes, Barley, and Oates, if thou sowest any of them: sowe them\r\nvpon the eight day of April, which is the Equinoctiall vernall,[39]\r\nwhen _Libra_[40] draweth the houres of the day and night to an\r\neuen and iust proportion, and what Corne is so sowne prospereth\r\ngreatly: but if thou wilt be assured that no Corne thou sowest\r\nshall faile, then take Salt-peeter and mingle with thy Corne,\r\nand sow it, and thy labor shall neuer be frustrate. For want of\r\nit, take the black dreggs of Oyle, and wette thy seede ere thou\r\nsow it, and it shall vndoubtedly spring vp. If thou hast none of\r\nthese, then take Pigions dunge, and mingle it with thy seede in thy\r\nhopper, and sow it: though it be not so good as the other, yet is\r\nthe profitable vertue wonderfull.\r\n\r\n=35.= 7. _Kente_] Kent, and Hartfordshiere.\r\n\r\n8. _gise_] vse. _Gise_ = guise, way, manner, plan. I. R. has “great\r\nsafety for sheding the Corne,” retaining here the old use of _for_.\r\n\r\n12. I. R. adds--For your seede, if you will be aduised by me,\r\nyou shall change it alway once in two or three yeare. For to sow\r\ncontinually one seede bred in one soyle it will decay & grow ill:\r\nand in your exchange draw it alwayes from the harder soyle, and\r\nbeing brought into a better, it must the rather prosper.\r\n\r\n=36.= 3. _reed_] reeded. This form is wrong, like our use of\r\n_wonted_ for _wont_ (= won-ed).\r\n\r\nAt the end of this section, I. R. closes his First Booke.\r\n\r\n=37.= 6. Here I. R. inserts--Of Sheepe there be two sorts, that\r\nis, blacke and white, but the white is the best, for the Wooll\r\nthey beare there bee of diuers Staples: some long and hairie, as\r\nthose bredde in barren cold Countries, and that is the worst;\r\nsome hard, short, and curld, as those bred in woody grounds, and\r\nthat is better: some long, thicke, soft, and curled, and that is\r\nthe best of all: and they be bredde vpon fine heathes, where they\r\nhaue short, dry, and sweet foode. The profit of wooll the world\r\ncan witnesse, and yeerely your Ewes will bring forth Lambes,\r\nwhich is an other commoditie; and lastly, in some Countries, as\r\nin Suffolke, Essex, and Kent, with many other, they milke their\r\nEwes, a gaine equall to the rest. Therfore when you chuse sheepe,\r\nelect them big-boand and well-woolld, their colours beeing white.\r\nFor _Virgill_ faines, that _Cynthia_, the Goddess of Chastitie,\r\nin whose thoughts could neuer enter impuritie, was enamored of\r\n_Endimion_ onely through hys flocke of white sheepe. When therfore\r\nyou haue got a flock of white sheepe, then you must chuse Rams to\r\nequall them, for preseruing the breede: your Ram would bee white\r\nalso, and ouer and beside you must looke in his mouth, and if the\r\nroofe thereof be blacke, then is hee not good: for either hee will\r\nthen get blacke Lambes, or at least staine theyr fleeces with a\r\nduskie colour. The greater the homes of your Ram is, the worse; for\r\nthe pollard is the chiefest Ram.\r\n\r\n14. _blyssomme or ryde_] blossome and arride.\r\n\r\n16. _at the Exaltation of the holye crosse_] in September.\r\n\r\n32. I. R. adds--Wherfore be carefull to keepe thy sheepe well, both\r\nwith hay in Winter as well as with grasse in Sommer. Also in the\r\nWinter such Sheepe as thou intendest to fatte and sell, let them\r\neither haue straw or fleakes to lie vpon, for the cold earth will\r\nboth disease them and hinder their feeding.\r\n\r\n=38.= 3. _trouse_] brouse. See these words in the glossary.\r\n\r\n6, 7. The sense is--and if she (the ewe) will not stand sideways\r\nbeside the lamb; _i.e._ in such a position that the lamb can\r\napproach her side. There is an evident misprint in l. 7, where\r\nthe original has _ewe_ for _lambe_. I. R. tries to make sense\r\nby turning _all_ into _call_; thus--“and if she wil not stand\r\nside-long, call the Ewe and giue her a little hay.” This is an\r\nevident attempt at making sense by falsifying the grammar of the\r\ntext; for Fitzherbert does not say “_and_ give her,” but “_than_\r\ngyue her,” _i.e._ then give her. Consequently all that precedes the\r\nword _than_ belongs to the clause containing the supposition.\r\n\r\n=39.= 9. After _theym_, I. R. inserts--Yet _Virgill_ aduiseth you\r\nin such a case to haue a leather full of sharp poynted nayles,\r\nwhich being put about the musell of the Lambe, if it offer to\r\nsucke, it will so pricke the dugges of the Ewe th_a_t she will not\r\nsuffer it, but by that meanes weane it perforce: and by the same\r\ndeuise you may weane all maner of Cattell whatsoeuer. See Virg.\r\nGeorg. iii. 399.\r\n\r\n=40.= 14. _steke_] shutt (which is a gloss).\r\n\r\n24. _go belte, grese_, _i.e._ go and belt them, and grease them.\r\nAs to _belting_, see the next section. I. R. very stupidly alters\r\nthe phrase to _goe melt grease_, though he has to retain the word\r\n_belt_ below.\r\n\r\n=41.= 18. It is hard to make an old dog stoop; _i.e._ it is hard to\r\nmake him submit to being taught. This occurs in Heywood’s Proverbs,\r\n1562 (Hazlitt). In the most insipid way, I. R. alters _to stoupe_\r\ninto _for Sheepe_, spoiling the whole saying.\r\n\r\n=43.= To _medle terre_ is to mix tar. I. R. alters _medle_ in the\r\nrubric to _melt_, and then substitutes _mingled_ for _medled_ in l.\r\n1. This is very clumsy.\r\n\r\n=44.= In the rubric, I. R. alters _brome_ to _browne_, which is\r\ncertainly wrong; see the context.\r\n\r\n7. _gelly_] Ielly. Yet the spelling with _g_ is well enough.\r\n\r\n8. _pysse_] pisse or lye. See _lye_ in the glossary.\r\n\r\n14. _or of faldynge_, &c.] or a folding of some such soft cloth or\r\nwooll. It is clear that I. R. did not know the word _faldynge_, or\r\nhe would not thus have altered the text.\r\n\r\n17. _sheydes_] sheeds; _i.e._ partings; see sect. 42, l. 4.\r\n\r\n24. _for_] from (as in other places). _For_ = against, to prevent.\r\n\r\n=45.= 4. _fyled_] filled. This is wrong; _fyled_ means fouled,\r\ndefiled.\r\n\r\n=46.= 3. _rather_] sooner. I. R. adds--There be diuers waters for\r\nthis purpose, as water made of Sandiuer and burnt Allom, or the\r\niuyce of Housleeke strained and mingled with Rose-water; or the\r\nbraines of an hatched, as thus: Take a linnen cloth, and burne it\r\nvpon the head of a hatchet, then blow away the ashes, and there\r\nwilbe on the hatchets head a kind of oyle, that taken and put in a\r\nsheepes eye, is most excellent.\r\n\r\n=47.= 3. _clese_] clawes.\r\n\r\n9. _clese_] clea. _Clea_ is _claw_; _clese_ = _cleas_, claws.\r\n\r\n15. _pece of fleshe_] peece of fleame (i.e. phlegm).\r\n\r\n=48.= 12. I. R. adds--to the great hinderance of the sale.\r\n\r\n=49.= 1. _pockes_] Pox (the modern spelling).\r\n\r\n9. I. R. adds--but if you cannot wash them, then let them blood in\r\nthe roofes of the mouth, and after they haue left bleeding, giue\r\nthem a supping of milke and Saffron mingled together.\r\n\r\n=51.= 6. _murtheryng or ouer-pressyng_] smoothering or oppressing.\r\nAnd certainly _smothering_ seems the right word.\r\n\r\n10. I. R. adds--Wash your sheepe in running Riuers, for standing\r\nPonds are ill.\r\n\r\n=52.= 4. _tarboxe_] Tarbox, or bronne salue. Here _bronne_ is a\r\nmisprint for _broune_; and _broune_ is a mistake for _brome_. See\r\nnote to sect. 44 above.\r\n\r\n=54.= 14. After _shepe_, I. R. inserts--salt marshes onely excepted.\r\n\r\n22. _kelles vppon the grasse_] kels vpon the grasse like to\r\nSpinners webs. (A _spinner_ is a spider.)\r\n\r\n31. _white snailes_] white finells (not clearly printed).\r\n\r\n=55.= 2. _stryndes_] strings (badly). So also in l. 4.\r\n\r\n16. _lyttel quikens_] a little quicknes (absurdly). _flokes_]\r\nflocks. But _flukes_ are meant.\r\n\r\nHere I. R. inserts a chapter on goats, as follows.\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 20.\r\n\r\n¶ Of Goates and their profit or vse.\r\n\r\nThus hauing sufficiently debated touching the choosing, cherishing,\r\nand curing of sheep, I thinke it good a little to speake of Goates\r\nand their vse: a kinde of Cattell which albe heere in England we\r\nestimate not to his worth, yet in other places they be of highest\r\nvaluation: and the excellent poet _Virgill_ in his Countrey muse,\r\ndraweth them and sheepe to march in one euen equipage. Thus\r\ncomparing them, the Goate (saith he) yeeldeth in milke three times\r\nthe quantity a sheepe doth, theyr young ones are more plentifull,\r\nfor they will haue two or three, and sometimes more, and their\r\nbeards yearely being shorne and spunne, haue made an excellent\r\nduring stuffe, which for the continuance, hath made Marriners\r\ndesirous onely to weare it in their garments, so that though their\r\nbeards cannot in quantity and fineness be equall with the fleece of\r\nthe sheepe, yet ioyning their milke and their young ones to their\r\nbeards, there is no wonderfull difference.\r\n\r\nTheir manner of keeping, both wintering and sommering, is in the\r\nPoets rules the same that the Sheepe hath, onely theyr foulding\r\nand feed excepted: for the foulding they are not needfull, and\r\nfor their feede, Woods are the best, or the toppes of Mountaines:\r\nbushie and thorny grounds vnprofitable for any other vse, for the\r\nfeede of Goates is most excellent. They will obserue custome much\r\nbetter than Sheepe, for beeing but once or twice vsed there-vnto,\r\nthey will duely euery morning and euening come home, to pay theyr\r\ndue debt or tribute to the milke-paile. Theyr milk is excellent,\r\nand a great restoratiue, principally for a consumption, of what\r\nnature soeuer. The fourth howre after the Sun rise, is the best\r\ntime for Goates to drinke in. For the weaning of young Kidds from\r\ntheir Dams, vse the meanes that you doo with Ewes and Lambes.\r\n\r\nOf all Goates that are, _Virgil_ most commends the _Cinyphian_\r\nGoates, bred by the Towne _Cinyps_, as Cattell of wondrous great\r\nco_m_moditie: their disprofit is onely amongst young springs or\r\nplants, for they wil crop any young thing that groweth, and hinder\r\nthe springing thereof, also they wil pill away the barke of Trees,\r\nto the spoyle of the trees: yet no more then fallow Deare, or redde\r\nDeare will, wherfore where the one is suffered, the other may be\r\ntollerated. Cf. Virg. Georg. iii. 306-317.\r\n\r\n=56.= 4. _and fools_] foales, and pigs.\r\n\r\n7. _kye_] Kine. And so in l. 2 above.\r\n\r\n9. After _wel_ I. R. inserts--let thy Cowe be beetle-browed, and\r\nsterne of looke, her head and necke big, and from her throate\r\nhanging downe to her shanks a large and long dew-lappe; let her\r\nsides be proportionlesse and great, and euery part of her, euen her\r\nvery foote, so bigge as bigge may be. Let her eares be large and\r\nhairie, and her taile long, euen to the grounde, and bushie: if she\r\nbe spotted with white, or shrewd or wicked with her horne, it is an\r\nerror, but no fault, for it shewes mettle and goodnes; in generall,\r\nthe more bull-like a Cow is, the better she is. Let thy Cowe be\r\nfoure yeeres old ere she take the Bull, and at tenne yeeres sell\r\nher off, for then is her best caluing-time past. And thus much for\r\nthy Kine whose profit must goe to thy paile.\r\n\r\n17. I. R. adds--because he is hyde-bound, which is a foule\r\ninfirmitie.\r\n\r\n=57.= 1. _kye_] fatte Kine.\r\n\r\n2. _fore-croppe_] fore-crops.\r\n\r\n4. _hucbone_] huckle-bone. _nache_] natch.\r\n\r\n5. I. R. inserts _a_ after _cowe_; this is an improvement.\r\n\r\n=58.= 20. _husbandes_] antient Husbandmen. That is, I. R.\r\nrepudiates the notion as erroneous.\r\n\r\n32. I. R. adds--then giue him in a horne to drinke, olde Ale,\r\nSaffron, Treakle, and _Diascordion_, boyled together.\r\n\r\n34. _by goddes leue_] as writeth Chyron, Phillyrides, and Melampus.\r\nA singular variation.\r\n\r\n=59.= 11. _feitergrasse_] Fetter-grasse.\r\n\r\n=60.= 1. _dewbolne_] dew-boulne. _Bolne_ = bollen, swollen.\r\n\r\n14. I. R. adds--and then with a little Tarre and fresh Butter to\r\ncure the wound.\r\n\r\n=61.= 4. _ronne on water_] runne and water. The substitution is\r\nneedless; to _run on water_ means to run _with_ water.\r\n\r\n15. _and this_, &c.] to chafe him [_i.e._ to warm him]: and this\r\ncure is failelesse, so God be pleased.\r\n\r\n=62.= Rubric. _The turne_] Of the turne, otherwise called the\r\nsturdy.\r\n\r\n3. _for_] of (this use of _for_ being obsolescent).\r\n\r\n18. _for perysshynge_, _i.e._ to avoid piercing. _Perish_ for\r\n_pierce_ occurs in the various readings to P. Plowman, B. xvii.\r\n189, and Wycliffe, Job xl. 19.\r\n\r\n24. I. R. inserts--and anoynt it eyther with fresh butter or\r\nclarified Hoggs greace.\r\n\r\n=65.= 3. _Starkely_] stakely (a misprint). _Starkly_ is stiffly.\r\n\r\n5. I. R. adds--yet if a poore man shall haue such a beast & cannot\r\nspare his worke: if he will euery morning or euening bathe his legs\r\nwith Lynseede Oyle: it shall make him indure his worke, and keepe\r\nthe beast from any great paine or swelling.\r\n\r\nHere I. R. inserts two chapters, as follows.\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 31.\r\n\r\n¶ A soueraigne vnguent to cure the scabbe, itch, botches, or\r\nany surfeite whatsoeuer that commeth of heat or pouerty: or by\r\nmischance: taken from a most authentique Authour.\r\n\r\nTake a good quantitie of the blacke dregges of Oyle, foure\r\npenny-worth of Quicksiluer wel killed,[41] as much Brimstone,\r\nPitch, Wax, and Hoggs-grease as will make it thicke like an\r\noyntment: boyle these together, and with it annoynt the beast that\r\nis vnsound, and this will vndoubtedly cure him, and that in very\r\nshort season, if he be diligently tended.\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 32.\r\n\r\n¶ Another most excellent receite, to cure all manner of wounds,\r\nimpostumes, vlcers, or Fistulaes.\r\n\r\nTake the iuyce of the Onion called _Scilla_, take _Hellybor_, and\r\n_Bitumen Iudaicum_, mingle these together, and incorporate them\r\nin manner of a plaister. The _Macedonians_ and _Gelonians_ to\r\nthis receit adde the opening of a vaine in the sole of the foote\r\nof a beast, and then to giue him to drinke milke and horses blood\r\nmingled together, which cureth all inward impostumes, surfeits or\r\npoysons, and to the outward griefe to apply the plaister, which was\r\nneuer knowne to be frustrate.\r\n\r\n=66.= 27. I. R. has--and it is better to weane thy Calues at grasse\r\nthen at hard meate, if they went to grasse before.\r\n\r\n=68.= Here I. R. introduces a long flourish about the nobleness of\r\nhorses, instancing the fabulous brood born to Neptune and Ceres\r\n(who transformed herself into a mare), the transformation of Saturn\r\ninto a horse, and the like.\r\n\r\n22. I. R. has--and that shall yee knowe by diuers signes, as by\r\nher riding of other Horses, by her flinging about the fieldes, or\r\nlastly by her priuie part, for that will twirle open, and shut\r\nagaine, many times in an houre.\r\n\r\n37. _lx._] fortie (by misreading lx. as xl.).\r\n\r\n63-79. I. R. varies this, and has--put to your white Mares a\r\ndaple-gray Horse, so shall he gette all daples; to your bright\r\nbay mares a blacke bay horse, and so shall you gette all broune\r\nbayes; and to your blacke Mares, a blacke Horse, so he haue white\r\nfeet, white ratch, and white feather; so shall he gette well-marked\r\nblacke Colts. But for the Carte it much matters not for colours,\r\nbut for knowledge sake know that th_e_ broune bay, the daple-gray,\r\nthe bright bay, and the white lyard, are the best colours; all\r\nother colours haue defects and are imperfect: of markes one white\r\nfoote, a white starre, a white snyp, or a white rache is good: and\r\nan Ostrige feather in any place where the horse cannot see it, is\r\nthe best of all the markes that can be for a horse. And thus much\r\nfor horses or mares to be chosen or vsed.\r\n\r\n=70.= 3. _and hygh grasse_] and much fogge.\r\n\r\n8. _flasshes_] and flagges.\r\n\r\n9. _bunnes_] bands (wrongly).\r\n\r\n32. _aftermath_] after-croppe.\r\n\r\n33. _gyrre, &c._] gyre, and to scoure so much that hee wil hardly\r\nendure to labour.\r\n\r\n39. _horse_] horses. But _horse_ is the true old _plural_ form,\r\nthe sb. being neuter; A.S. _hors_, pl. _hors_. Nevertheless,\r\nFitzherbert himself has _horses_ in the line following.\r\n\r\n42. _put_] strike and hurte.\r\n\r\n=73.= 1. _rase or a ball_] starre. A _ball_ is a streak; hence the\r\nmod. E. _bald_, M.E. _ball-ed_. See _bald_ in my Etym. Dict.\r\n\r\n=74.= 2. _to be styffe-docked_] a stiffe docke or stearne of his\r\ntaile.\r\n\r\n=77.= 3. _syde-tailed_; _syde_ means ‘long.’\r\n\r\n=78.= 2. _cressed_] crested. And probably _cressed_ is a mere\r\nmisprint.\r\n\r\n5. _holowe-foted_] hollow-hooued.\r\n\r\n=79.= 7. _chowynge_] chewing.\r\n\r\n=80.= I. R. expands this chapter and the succeeding chapters\r\nso much that it would take up too much space to print all his\r\nadditions. He gives recipes for the cure of the various diseases,\r\nand inserts chapters ‘Of the head-ach or meagrum,’ ‘Of the\r\nstaggers,’ and ‘Of the Vines.’[42] I can only undertake to give\r\nhere a few notes to illustrate Fitzherbert’s text.\r\n\r\n=83.= I. R. has--The mourning of the tongue most commonly called\r\nthe Canker.\r\n\r\n=86, 87.= I. R. considers these two diseases together, and\r\ndiscourses of them at length, saying that he has ‘cured many very\r\nsore spent.’\r\n\r\n=88.= I. R. explains ‘Strangulion’ as appearing ‘in a swelling\r\nimpostume as bigge as a mans fist, iust betweene a horses chaules.’\r\n\r\n=89-113.= I. R. omits nearly all these sections, excepting 91\r\n(which agrees with his ‘Chapter 42. Of the Vines’) and sect. 109\r\n(which is his Chapter 54).\r\n\r\n=109.= I. R. has the rubric--‘Of enterfayring’; and\r\nsays--‘Enterfairing is a griefe that commeth sometimes by ill\r\nshooing, and sometimes naturally, when a Horse trots so narrow that\r\nhe hewes [knocks] one legge vpon another.’ It is what we now call\r\n‘over-stepping.’ The derivation is from the French form of Lat.\r\n_inter-ferire_; and it is from this term in farriery that we have\r\ntaken the mod. E. _interfere_.\r\n\r\n=116.= I. R. omits this section.\r\n\r\n=118.= I. R. introduces here ‘Chapter 55. How to make the pouder of\r\nhoney and lime.’\r\n\r\n=119.= 2, 6. The French lines are in doggerel rime, and the English\r\ntranslations seem also to be meant for verse, such as it is. The\r\nomission of the words or _iourneye_ (in l. 8) would improve the\r\nscansion.\r\n\r\n8. _or nyght_, i.e. ere night. Altered by I. R. to _out-right_.\r\n\r\n=120.= 4. _tame_] lame (!); an ominous mistake, for which the\r\ncompositor should have the credit.\r\n\r\n=121.= 4. We may feel sure that this _sayinge_ was originally in\r\nverse. Perhaps it ran thus:\r\n\r\n      “He that hath sheep, and swyne, and hyue,\r\n      Slepe he, wake he, he maye thryue.”\r\n\r\nOr we might write _been_ (Chaucer’s plural of _bee_), riming with\r\n_theen_, the usual M. E. word for ‘thrive.’\r\n\r\n9. _Hogges._ As to the exact sense of this word, see the note on\r\nit in the ‘Corrections and Additions’ to the larger edition of my\r\nEtymological Dictionary.\r\n\r\n=122.= 38. _sclatte_] slate.\r\n\r\n=124.= Here I. R. begins his third book, relating to timber and\r\ndistillations.\r\n\r\n12. _Midsummer-moon_ is an old phrase; it occurs in the second line\r\nof the prologue to the Plowman’s Tale, which is inserted in some\r\neditions of Chaucer, though really written by the anonymous author\r\nof the Plowman’s Crede.\r\n\r\n33. _muldes a spade-graffe depe_] mould with a spade a foot deepe.\r\n\r\n35. _peruse_] doo still.\r\n\r\n39. I. R. adds--or els beeing drowned, not to prosper.\r\n\r\n=125.= 4. _fyue fote brod, &c._] fiue foote broad, then it would\r\nbe set with three chesses or rowes one aboue another, but of what\r\ndepth or breadth soeuer, it would be double sette, &c.\r\n\r\n5. _hedge_] dead hedge.\r\n\r\n=126.= 2. _ellore_] Elder (the later form).\r\n\r\n6. _edderynge_] wood; see the glossary. So, in l. 7, I. R.\r\ntranslates _eddered_ by _bounde_; and again in l. 16, he alters\r\n_edderinges_ to _byndings_.\r\n\r\n9. _trouse_] brouse (as above); see 38. 3.\r\n\r\n=127.= 4. _the more halue_] more the_n_ halfe. But _the more\r\nhalfe_, i.e. the greater part, is right enough, and the older\r\nphrase. In l. 23, it is left unaltered.\r\n\r\n8. _in processe_] vnwares.\r\n\r\n15. _slaue_] stand (clearly not the right word). In l. 32, I. R.\r\nhas the spelling _sleaue_. So also in sect. 133, I. 6.\r\n\r\n=128.= 21. I. R. omits _and bolneth_; in l. 29, he alters _bolne_\r\nto _rise_.\r\n\r\n=129.= 10. _to leuse_] so looseneth.\r\n\r\n11. _gete_] got. But _gete_ is the old form of the pp.; A.S.\r\n_geten_.\r\n\r\n=130.= 4. _casses_] Kasses. I. R. omits _or wydes_.\r\n\r\n5. _slauynges_] sleanings (_sic_). The form _popeler_ reminds me\r\nthat I have heard the large poplar-tree at ‘Hyde-park Corner’ in\r\nCambridge called ‘the _popular_ tree.’ See l. 23.\r\n\r\n12, 16. _osyerde wethy_] Asiere Withy.\r\n\r\n=131.= 7. _kydde_] kid or faggot.\r\n\r\n9, 16. _brenne_] burne.\r\n\r\n14. _to peruse them_] persist.\r\n\r\n=132.= 4. I. R. omits ‘and also the yues.’\r\n\r\n5. _bowe_] hewe. But _bowe_ refers to the bending of it before it\r\nis cut; the bent piece is called the _byghte_ in the next line. I.\r\nR. alters _byghte_ to _bough_.\r\n\r\n18. _brede_] breadth (which is the later form).\r\n\r\n21. _xvi._] one and twenty (by misreading _xvi._ as _xxi._).\r\n\r\n=133.= 1. _gyse_] vse of men.\r\n\r\n6. _slaue_] sleaue; and in l. 16.\r\n\r\n10. _hym_] the seller.\r\n\r\n11. _an_] one (which is the meaning intended).\r\n\r\n14. _ouer_] vpper.\r\n\r\n=134.= 7. _garches_] garthes. In ed. 1534, it is plainly _garches_;\r\nbut confusion between _c_ and _t_ is extremely common, as they were\r\n_written_ nearly alike.\r\n\r\n18. _a greatte_] by great. The two phrases have different senses;\r\n_a greate_ means ‘in the lump,’ without cutting or dressing the\r\ntrees, as appears from the next line. But _by great_ means ‘by\r\nwholesale’; which contradicts l. 1.\r\n\r\n=136.= 6. _graffe_] graft (throughout; which is the later form).\r\n\r\n10. I. R. omits _the narower kyrfe, and_; to avoid the word _kyrfe_.\r\n\r\n=137.= 10. _pyrre-stocke_] Peare-tree stocke.\r\n\r\n14. I. R. says--a Crab-tree stocke is good, but the Apple-tree\r\nstocke it-selfe is much better.\r\n\r\n=138.= 1. _lanses_] branches.\r\n\r\n10. _nothynge_] any thing.\r\n\r\n26. _marley_] marle.\r\n\r\n29. _cleauynge_] place clouen.\r\n\r\n30. _for chynynge of the claye_] for feare the clay through drines\r\nshould cleaue or riue.\r\n\r\n33. _clayenge_] cleauing (which is clearly wrong).\r\n\r\n36. I. R. adds--And three grafts are enough for any stock\r\nwhatsoeuer, and sooner they will couer the head then foure, fiue,\r\nor sixe.\r\n\r\n=139.= 6. _tenaunte_] tennant.\r\n\r\n9. _ponch_] punch.\r\n\r\n10. _stop_] scope. _one syde_] other side.\r\n\r\n19. _clyppe_] slip.\r\n\r\n20. After _growe_, I. R. adds--and to fence it close about with\r\nsome thick-set hedge.\r\n\r\nAfter this section I. R. inserts ‘Chapter 17. Howe to graft by\r\nleafe, causing all manner of fruit to grow vpon one tree.’ His\r\nmethod is to insert what we should now call a slip, with a stalk\r\nand leaf growing from it.\r\n\r\n=140.= 2. _scyences_] syens. In fact, _scyences_ (= scions-es) is a\r\ndouble plural, and was probably a provincial term, like _nesteses_\r\nor _nesses_ for _nests_. So also _fairies-es_ is a country name\r\nfor _fairies_, which some lexicographers, not understanding,\r\nactually write and print as _Pharisees_!\r\n\r\n6. _he wyll_] you will. This alteration is made wherever the phrase\r\noccurs.\r\n\r\n8. _lyke_] like or prosper in any wise.\r\n\r\n*** Here I. R. inserts a large portion of his own (or perhaps\r\ncopied from other sources) without any hint that it is not in his\r\noriginal. The insertion extends from p. 103 to p. 143, and contains\r\nthe following chapters.\r\n\r\nChapter 19. Of gardening or planting.\r\n\r\nChapter 20. Of distillation, what it is.\r\n\r\nChapter 21. Of Beanes and the distillation thereof.\r\n\r\nChapter 22. Of Cherries and their distillation.\r\n\r\nChapter 23. Of Walnuts and their distillation.\r\n\r\nChapter 24. Of small Nuts and their distillation.\r\n\r\nChapter 25. Of Honny and the distillation thereof.\r\n\r\nChapter 26. Of Apples and their distillation.\r\n\r\nChapter 27. Of Peaches and their distillation.\r\n\r\nChapter 28. Of Mallowes and their distillation.\r\n\r\nChapter 29. Of Grapes and their distillation.\r\n\r\nChapter 30. Of Quinces and their distillation.\r\n\r\nChapter 31. The distillation of Cardus [_sic_] benedictus, or the\r\nblessed thistle.\r\n\r\nChapter 32. The distillation of Angellica.\r\n\r\nChapter 33. The distillation of Cammomile.\r\n\r\nChapter 34. The distillation of Germander.\r\n\r\nChapters 35-40. The distillation of Eyebright, Hopps, wood Lilly,\r\nBalme, Strawberries, and Cinamon.\r\n\r\nChapter 41. Of Nutmegs and their vse.\r\n\r\nChapters 42-44. Of Mace, Pepper, and Cloues.\r\n\r\nChapter 45. An excellent Balme to take away any blemish vppon the\r\nskinne.\r\n\r\nChapter 46. A receite to cure any wound or hurt.\r\n\r\nChapter 47. An approved receite for the gowte.\r\n\r\nWith this Chapter he closes ‘the third booke of Husbandry.’\r\n\r\nThe fourth book has an introductory chapter, not in Fitzherbert,\r\nsubdivided into sections with the following headings. The office of\r\na Steward of a houshold. For prouiding of victuals. The Steward and\r\nGarniter.[43] The Steward and Miller. The Steward and Baker. The\r\nPantry. The Butler. The Seller.[44] The Ewrie.[45] Of the Cooke.\r\nOf the Scullery. Of the Vsher of the Hall. Of the Yeoman of the\r\nWardrop [Wardrobe]. The Slaughter-man. The Cater [caterer]. The\r\nClarke of the Kitchin.\r\n\r\nAfter this, I. R. condescends to return to his original.\r\n\r\n=141.= 36. _sherde_] breach (which is a gloss).\r\n\r\n49. _tyne_] shut (a gloss). _traile_] tale (probably a misprint).\r\n\r\n59. _put it_] blot them.\r\n\r\n72. _loked uppon_] attended vnto.\r\n\r\n=142.= This is a most singular section, since it presupposes that\r\na gentleman’s servant would be able to recognise the rhythm of an\r\nEnglish hexameter. As an early experiment in hexameters, it is very\r\ncurious. In the original, it is printed as _prose_, but each line\r\nends with a full stop, and the next begins with a capital letter.\r\nI have therefore printed it as verse. It is, however, of a rather\r\nrude character; _horne boget_ hardly comes up to our idea of a\r\ndactyl, nor _and shoes_ to that of a spondee. For the reader’s\r\nassistance, I may remark that the _dactyls_ are as follows: _Purse\r\ndagger, -chef shoyng-, horne boget, -ter sadel-, hatte with thy,\r\nBowe arrowes, stringe and thy, Penne paper, -waxe pommes, bokes\r\nthou re-, -ble nedle, leste that thy, -gel gyue thy, se he be, Make\r\nmery, synge and thou, hede to thy, gere that thou_. The rest are\r\nspondees.\r\n\r\nI. R., not perceiving the law of rhythm, makes wild work of it. He\r\ncalls it “An excellent rude Lesson in rude ryme.” He divides the\r\nlines rightly, and leaves the first three verses untouched. But the\r\nrest assume the following fearful forms.\r\n\r\n      Penne, paper, incke, parchment, redde waxe, punisse (_sic_),\r\n        and bookes doe thou remember,\r\n      Penknife, combe, thymble, needle, thred, and poynt,\r\n        least that by chaunce thy garth breake.\r\n      Bodkin, knyfe, rubber, giue thy horse meate,\r\n        See he be shodde well, make merry, sing if thou can,\r\n        And take heede to thy needments, that thou loose none.\r\n\r\nI think we may fairly put these down as being the worst verses\r\nextant in the English language; though this is saying a good deal.\r\n\r\n=143.= 7. The saying doubtless represents a rude couplet in verse.\r\nThe dative case _wyfe_ (governed by _of_) was formerly spelt\r\n_wyue_, and rimed with _thryue_.\r\n\r\n=144.= _Salomon_, Solomon. But where to find, in his writings, this\r\nremarkable sentence, I do not know.\r\n\r\n*** After this section I. R. inserts a quantity of additional\r\nmatter, which he tells us (at p. 174) is drawn from his ‘owne\r\nexperience in byrds and foules.’ The additional chapters treat\r\nof choice of cocks, hens for brood, number of eggs to each hen,\r\nchickens, diseases of poultry (especially of the pip), choice of\r\npoultry, how to fat poultry, how to make capons, where to keep\r\npoultry, how to choose, keep, and fatten geese, how to keep ducks,\r\npeacocks, ‘ginny or turkie-cocks,’ pigeons, pheasants, turtles,\r\npartridges, and swans; after which digression he returns to his\r\ntext. I may remark that he considers it essential that a hen should\r\nsit upon _an odd number_ of eggs, say 19, and that matters should\r\nbe so arranged as to provide for the hatching of chickens ‘in the\r\nincrease of the Moone.’ The leaves of a bay-tree, ‘or els some\r\nBents or Grasse,’ will preserve eggs ‘from the hurt of thunder.’\r\nChickens ought not ‘to be breathed vpon by any Snake, Toade, or\r\nother venomous thing’; if they are, you must quickly burn amongst\r\nthem some ‘_Galbanum_, or womans hayre.’ Those that have the pip\r\nshould be dieted on Hearbgrace [rue] or garlic. Geese ‘are more\r\nwatchfull then Doggs.’ ‘You must vse in the time of brooding, to\r\nlay vnder your egges [of geese] the rootes of Nettles, to the end\r\nthe Gosling may escape stinging of Nettles, which otherwise many\r\ntimes killeth them.’ If geese are to have fat livers, feed them\r\non dry figs mingled with water. Ducks chiefly delight in acorns.\r\nIf you praise a peacock, ‘he will presently sette vp his taile.’\r\nA turkey-cock ‘is very highly esteemed of, both for his rarenesse\r\nand greatnes of body;’ and we are told that he changes the colour\r\nof the wrinkled skin about his head at pleasure, either to white,\r\nred, blue, yellow, ‘or what other colour els hee list; which thing\r\nmaketh him seeme wonderfull st[r]ange to them that behold it.’\r\n... ‘Their greatest diseases is the Pip and the Squecke.’ As to\r\npigeons, ‘I haue knowne some that haue builded their Doue-houses\r\nvpon high pillars ouer the midst of some Pond or great water, both\r\nbecause they delight much in water, and also to keepe them the\r\nsafer from vermine.’ Swans ‘will, when they waxe olde, declare the\r\ntime of their own death to be neere approching, by a sweete and\r\nlamentable note which they then sing.’\r\n\r\n=145.= 15. I. R. has--‘Wherefore it is conuenient (I say) that\r\nthey loue each other as effectually as loue can in the best sence\r\ncomprehend: and this worke especiallie, a woman is bound both by\r\nlaw and nature to performe.’ Why so?\r\n\r\n=146.= I. R. omits ll. 2-7; he was certainly a Protestant.\r\n\r\n8. _redy._ This is the old word for _dressed_, as might be shewn\r\nby many examples. It may suffice to say that I. R. explains _araye\r\ntheym_ in l. 11 by _make them ready_.\r\n\r\n10. _socle_] suckle. I. R. omits _sye vp thy mylke_, which he\r\nprobably did not understand.\r\n\r\n13. I. R. omits _and take thy parte with theym_; and, for _serue\r\nthy swyne_ (l. 20) he puts _looke to the seruing of thy Swine_.\r\nCustoms were probably changing.\r\n\r\n31. _the gleyd_] Kites. And _fullymartes_ is omitted.\r\n\r\n35. After _eate_, I. R. adds--in Sallets, or otherwise.\r\n\r\n42. _hecheled_] heckled.\r\n\r\n43. _wrapped_] warped.\r\n\r\n51. _ripeled_, i.e. rippled; I. R. has _repled_. In l. 41 above, I.\r\nR. has _repealed_; yet this is, I suppose, the same word.\r\n\r\n53. _loken_] Locken. It means locked or tightly closed up; for\r\n_lock_ was once a strong verb.\r\n\r\n57. _pulled_] culled (which is an ingenious alteration and perhaps\r\nright).\r\n\r\n104. The Knight of the Tour-Landry is the book here referred to,\r\nand was one of the books printed by Caxton. The edition printed\r\nby the Early English Text Society, and edited by T. Wright, is so\r\neasily accessible that it is needless to say more here than that\r\nFitzherbert’s description of it is perfectly correct.\r\n\r\n=147.= 12. _rendit_] tendit. This correction may be right, but I\r\nam not sure of it. The Leonine (or riming) verses quoted cannot be\r\nof any great antiquity, and it is quite possible that _rendit_ is\r\nintended as a Low-Latin translation of the French _rend_, pr. s.\r\nof _rendre_. The true Latin word is, of course _reddit_; which,\r\nhowever, gives no rime. Fitzherbert’s translation is intended to be\r\nin verse.\r\n\r\n=148.= 3. _brynke_] brim. “Better spare at brim than at bottom”;\r\nHazlitt’s Proverbs. And see note to Tusser, 10. 35.\r\n\r\n12. _tedure_] teathure (not a good spelling.)\r\n\r\n15. _lees_] ground. _flytte_] shift.\r\n\r\n17. _tyed_] stakt.\r\n\r\n26. _putteth hym in the pynfolde_] impoundes him.\r\n\r\n38. _ren ryot_] runne.\r\n\r\n43. _it is meruayle_] gracious were th_e_ stars of thy natiuitie (a\r\nfine phrase!).\r\n\r\n=150, 151, 152, 153.= I. R. omits these four sections.\r\n\r\n=153.= 3. This quotation, from Dionysii Catonis Disticha, iii. 7,\r\nappears also in P. Plowman, B. xii. 23.\r\n\r\n28. I do not know where to find this quotation.\r\n\r\n=155.= 10. _behouable_] behoouefull (which is a better form).\r\n\r\n=156.= In the rubric, I. R. has--‘what riches are’; but in l. 1, he\r\nhas--‘It is now requisite to know what riches is.’ Already _riches_\r\nwas becoming a plural substantive. It may be remarked that I. R.\r\nomits the _Latin_ forms of all the quotations.\r\n\r\n=157.= 19. _duetie_] debt (which is what is meant). So also in ll.\r\n22, 24.\r\n\r\n=160.= 2. After _declare_, I. R. inserts--and euery booke of Common\r\nprayer dooth containe them. A pertinent remark.\r\n\r\n=161.= 3. I. R. omits the reference to the Athanasian Creed, and\r\nsays we must ‘beleeue stedfastly the Catholick fayth.’\r\n\r\n25. I. R. omits from _The fulfyllynge_ to the end of the section.\r\nFor a description of the seven works of mercy, see Spenser, F. Q.\r\n1. 10. 36.\r\n\r\n=163.= 3. I. R. has--and hast a stedfast fayth in Christ. He has\r\nalmost wholly rewritten this section, and says we are bound ‘to\r\ncome to common prayer;’ and omits the quotation from St. Ambrose.\r\n\r\n=164.= 7. It is remarkable that the author should refer us to the\r\n3rd chapter of Proverbs instead of the 15th. Our forefathers seem\r\nto have had no idea either of giving a correct reference or of\r\nverifying one.\r\n\r\n10. _Qui a_ is printed, in Fitzherbert, as _Quia_, in one word. The\r\ncorrection being obvious, I have made it.\r\n\r\n18. _Isodorus_] Osorius. Why this alteration is made, I cannot\r\ntell. In l. 29 of the next section, I. R. has _Isidore_, and in l.\r\n37, _Isidorus_.\r\n\r\n=165.= 39. _Hampole_] Hanapole (wrongly). Richard Rolle, of\r\nHampole, was the author of the Pricke of Conscience, edited by Dr.\r\nMorris for the Philological Society, and of numerous other works,\r\nincluding some Religious Treatises edited by Mr. Perry for the\r\nEarly English Text Society.\r\n\r\n47. I. R. omits this line; he probably did not like the word\r\n_oratory_.\r\n\r\n52. The first book of Samuel was formerly called the first book of\r\nKings.\r\n\r\n=166.= I. R. rewrites this section, and avoids any reference to\r\n_Latin_ or to the _Ave Maria_.\r\n\r\n=167.= 19, 20. I. R. gives the Latin lines, and his own\r\ntranslation, as follows.\r\n\r\n      The ghostly enemy doth not stay\r\n      Till tempted persons doe obey:\r\n      For yeelding, hee a Lyon is,\r\n      Gainestood, a flie: his pray doth misse.\r\n\r\nHis syntax is as bad as his translation.\r\n\r\n34. _steke_] shutte.\r\n\r\n35. _styfly_] manfully. We have here an idea which is frequently\r\nmet with in our literature. It may suffice to refer to\r\nGrosseteste’s Chastel d’Amour, the sermon called Soules Warde\r\nprinted in Dr. Morris’s Specimens of English, part i., the extract\r\nfrom the Ayenbite of Inwyt printed in Morris and Skeat’s Specimens,\r\npart ii., the Tower of Truth and Castle of Caro described in Piers\r\nthe Plowman, &c. We are also reminded of Bunyan’s Holy War.\r\n\r\n=168.= 31. Here again Fitzherbert gives us the wrong reference to\r\nthe Proverbs, viz. to Chap. xiv. instead of Chap. xix. His reading\r\n_Veneratur dominus_] is extraordinary.\r\n\r\n=169.= 11. _vnable to be foughten agaynst_] inuinsible.\r\n\r\n13, 14. _slecketh_] slacketh. _slake_] quench.\r\n\r\n35. I. R. copies Fitzherbert’s reference to Chap. 35; but read 34.\r\n\r\n=172.= 14. _conuerted_] conuarted (a peculiar pronunciation).\r\n\r\n21. This quotation from St. Augustine appears also in Piers\r\nPlowman, B. v. 291.\r\n\r\n50. This last paragraph is called by I. R. ‘Fitzherberts\r\nprotestation;’ yet he actually alters his author’s words,\r\nsubstituting ‘the holy scriptures’ for ‘al holy churche,’ with\r\nvarious other smaller ‘corrections.’\r\n\r\nTo crown his effrontery, he gives the address of ‘The Authour to\r\nhis Booke’ in the following extraordinary (amended) form!\r\n\r\n      Goe grosse fram’d image of a holy saint,\r\n        present my loue, though rude my pensill paint;\r\n      If any blame thee for deformitie,\r\n        say Nature calld thee, and not Oratorie;\r\n      If on thy browes be starres of ignorance,\r\n        say Fortunes pype did neuer teach thee dance.\r\n      Wish them amend which best can iudge thine ill,\r\n        so shall both thou and I bee happy still.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[36] Such is the general rule; but in Lowland Scotch, we have\r\n_Dalziel_, _Menzies_, pronounced as _Dalyell_, _Menyies_, _i.e._\r\nwith _z_ for _y_ in the _middle_ of a word, where it usually has\r\nthe force of _gh_.\r\n\r\n[37] I shall in future drop the initials “I. R.” in these\r\ncollations. It will be understood that these various readings are\r\nall from the same source.\r\n\r\n[38] Cf. the name _pod-ware_, as applied to beans and peas. See\r\nHalliwell.\r\n\r\n[39] Printed--“Vernall. When.” This cuts the sentence in half, and\r\nmakes nonsense.\r\n\r\n[40] A singular mistake; he means _Aries_.\r\n\r\n[41] I.e. mortified. “_Mortify_, to change the outward form of\r\na mixt body, as when quicksilver ... is dissolved in an acid\r\nmenstruum”; Phillips.\r\n\r\n[42] _Sic_; but we commonly find _viues_ or _vives_. And in fact,\r\nFitzherbert treats of it below, in section 91.\r\n\r\n[43] I.e. the servant who had charge of the _garners_ or granaries,\r\nand whose business it was to send corn to the mill, the stable, and\r\nthe poultry-yard.\r\n\r\n[44] Cellar.\r\n\r\n[45] Ewery; where were kept ‘Napery, Basons, Ewers, sweete waters,\r\nPerfumes, Torches, Supper-lights, Prickets, sises of Waxe, and such\r\nlike;’ also ‘tallow Candles, Candle-sticks, Snuffers, and such\r\nother.’\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGLOSSARIAL INDEX.\r\n\r\n  The references are to the _sections_ and _lines_, as numbered.\r\n  Besides the usual contractions, note that _v._ = verb in the\r\n  infinitive mood, _pr. s._ = present tense, _third_ person\r\n  singular, unless 1 _p._ or 2 _p._ is added.
