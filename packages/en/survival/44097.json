The first age of French Canada, of New York, of great part\r\nof North America, was one of hunters and trappers, and it has\r\ncontinued in the Northwest till recent times. The first brief period\r\nof Rhodesia was that of the big-game hunter. The Boers of the\r\nTransvaal are still as much hunters as farmers. The American\r\nbackwoodsman who clears a patch, then sells his improvements to the\r\nfirst newcomer, and, placing his wife and children and scanty\r\nbelongings on a cart, proceeds _da capo_ elsewhere, is a nomadic\r\npioneer. The stage is in one way or another perpetual, for the class\r\nnever quite dies out. The drunken English quarryman who, driven by a\r\ndemon of restlessness, continually goes \"on tramp,\" and in his\r\nwanderings covers on foot a space equal to twice the circumference of\r\nthe globe, is a demi-savage whose nomadism is only checked by the\r\n\"abhorred approaches of old age.\" If he emigrates, he repeats the old,\r\nwild life as a pick-and-shovel man in Queensland or a quarryman in New\r\nSouth Wales. The soberer colonial youth, who more luxuriously canters\r\nfrom farm to farm in New Zealand on the back of a scrub, is a tamer\r\nspecimen who settles down when he marries. Nay, the \"restless man\" who\r\nperiodically applies for leave of absence from a colonial legislature\r\nin order to travel in India, China, and Timbuctoo, is a still milder\r\nbut not less incorrigible example of the same indestructible type.\r\n\r\nThe pastoral stage is all but universal. Wherever grass grows (and\r\nthere is wild grass almost everywhere) sheep can graze, and where\r\nthere are succulent twigs cattle will fatten on them. The South\r\nAmerican _estancias_ and the ranches of Colorado, the cattle runs of\r\nQueensland and northern New Zealand, the sheep runs of Victoria and\r\nNew South Wales repeat and perpetuate this stage. The genesis of it\r\nmay even now be daily observed. A Manchester accountant who has never\r\nbefore been astride a horse will in twelve months learn the mysteries\r\nof cattle and sheep farming, then purchase a hundred acres or two from\r\nthe colonial Government, gradually clear it of timber, build of his\r\nown trees, with no skilled assistance, a weatherboard cottage, and\r\ntake home a swiftly wooed wife to lead with him a rather desolate\r\nexistence in \"the bush.\" Or (on a larger scale) a squatter,[1] who is\r\ncommonly a gentleman by birth and education, comes out from England\r\nwith inherited wealth, buys or leases from the Government a large\r\ninland tract of grazing land, takes with him flocks and herds,\r\nshepherds and stockmen, builds a bark or wooden manor house, and\r\nsettles down to the life of Abram on the plains of Mamre. In earlier\r\ndays, when the colony was in its infancy, he would not have had to\r\npurchase or lease his \"run.\" One country after another saw the golden\r\nage of a would-be landed aristocracy. As Norman William parceled out\r\nall England among his nobles and knights, rulers of conquered\r\ncountries were then mighty free with what did not belong to them.\r\nPossessing the authority of a sovereign, Columbus made lavish grants\r\nof land, and thus pacified his rebels. Charles II presented Carolina\r\nto eight proprietors. Baronies of twelve thousand acres in South\r\nCarolina, manors of twenty thousand acres in Maryland, were dwarfed by\r\nterritorial principalities of more than a million acres in New York.\r\nThe absolute governors of early Australia gave away wide tracts. When\r\nland was not given it was taken, on Rob Roy's principle. During the\r\ninterregnum that followed the recall of the first Governor of New\r\nSouth Wales, military robbers seized fifteen thousand acres, and under\r\nsubsequent administrations they continued their depredations. Land was\r\nheld on various tenures. The first American forms were varieties of\r\nbelated feudalism; of a hundred often strange and ridiculous emblems\r\nof suzerainty perhaps a dozen repeated Old World customs.[2] Sir H. S.\r\nMaine has proved that nearly all the feudal exactions that maddened a\r\nwhole people to mutiny in 1789 were then in force in England. How\r\nshadowy they must have grown is shown by the fact that none of them\r\nwas transported to Botany Bay in that or later years. They were\r\natrophied portions of the British land system when Australia was\r\nfounded in 1788. For fully sixteen years the possession of lands\r\ngranted or seized was as absolute as the English law ever allows it to\r\nbe. Then the landholders, finding the large tracts already conceded\r\ninsufficient for the development of the pastoral industry, applied for\r\nmore, and themselves suggested in 1803 a plan of leasing crown lands\r\nwhich in the following year was legalized as \"the first charter of\r\nsquatterdom\"; it was the beginning of a system that has brought under\r\npastoral occupancy territories as extensive as the largest European\r\ncountries. The land system formed part of or gave birth to a political\r\norganization. A host of so-called _seigneurs_ imported into old Canada\r\nas much of the _ancien régime_ as would bear the voyage. Manors in\r\nMaryland reproduced the feudal courts-baron and courts-leet. The great\r\nNew York landowners, as inheriting both English and Dutch\r\ninstitutions, presided in such courts and were at the same time\r\nhereditary members of a powerful legislative order.[3] The courts were\r\ndropped on the way out to Australia, but the political influence of\r\nthe English landed aristocracy inhered in their representatives at the\r\nantipodes. As the Southern slavearchy, through its Washingtons and\r\nJeffersons, Clays and Calhouns, was for three quarters of a century\r\nthe driving force in American politics, the Australian squatterarchy\r\nfor one generation or more ruled the seven colonies with a sway that\r\nwaxed as the absolute power of the governor waned. It composed the\r\nlegislature, appointed the judges, controlled the executive, and if\r\nthe governor was refractory it sent him home. In both southern\r\ncountries social life reflected its tastes and was the measure of its\r\ngrandeur. It constituted \"society,\" ran the races, gave the balls, and\r\nkept open house; the surrounding villages lived in its sunshine. Why\r\ncould not this patriarchal state last, as it has lasted in Arabia for\r\nthousands of years and in Europe for centuries? In the Southern States\r\nit was brought to bankruptcy by the civil war. In Australia it\r\ncollapsed before two enemies as deadly--a succession of droughts and a\r\nfall in the price of wool. The banker has his foot on the squatter's\r\nneck. If one may judge from the published maps, three fourths of the\r\nfreehold land in the older colonies is in the hands of the money\r\nlenders. The once lordly runholder, who would have excluded from his\r\ntable, or at least from his visiting circle, any one engaged in\r\ncommerce, is now the tenant of a mortgage company which began by using\r\nhim too well and ended by crushing him unmercifully.\r\n\r\nIt is also brought to a close by the rise of the agricultural stage.\r\nThe colonial _latifundia_ gets broken up for the same economic reasons\r\nas that of the mother country. Whenever from the increase of\r\npopulation wheat-growing becomes more profitable than grazing, land\r\nrises in value, and vast sheep walks are subdivided into\r\ntwo-hundred-acre farms, which are put under the plow. The transition\r\nmay be retarded in some countries and altogether arrested in others.\r\nNasse has shown that, in consequence of the moisture of the climate,\r\nthere was in the sixteenth century a continual tendency in England to\r\nrevert from agriculture to pasture. The light rainfall, high\r\ntemperatures, and unfertilized soil will forever keep nine tenths of\r\nAustralia under grass. Most of the mountainous north and the\r\nglacier-shaved portions of the south of New Zealand must be perpetual\r\ncattle runs and sheep walks. A century or perhaps centuries will pass\r\nbefore much of the light soil of Tasmania, hardly enriched by the\r\nscanty foliage of the eucalyptus, is sufficiently fertilized by\r\ngrazing to grow corn. Rich alluvial or volcanic lands are put under\r\nthe plow, without passing through the pastoral stage, as soon as\r\nmarkets are created by the advent of immigrants. There is a cry for\r\nfarm lands. Companies that have bought large estates break them up\r\ninto allotments. When they or other large landholders still resist\r\npressure, the radical colonial legislature accelerates their\r\ndeliberations by putting on the thumbscrew of a statute which\r\nconfiscates huge cantles of their land. Or the colonial Government, if\r\nsocialist-democratic, purchases extensive properties, which it breaks\r\nup into farms and communistic village settlements. Over wide tracts\r\nthe agriculturist, great and small, takes the place of the\r\npastoralist. He holds his lands under a variety of tenures. New South\r\nWales, in its search for an ideal form, has flowered into fifteen\r\nvarieties. Other colonies are stumbling toward it more or less blindly\r\nthrough a succession of annual statutes. Where land is abundant the\r\ntenure will be easy. In North America nominal quitrents were general;\r\nthe system was long since introduced into South Africa, and it has\r\nlately been imported into New Zealand in spite of all previous\r\nexperience to the effect that such rents can not be collected. Mr.\r\nEggleston remarks that in the United States the tendency was to \"a\r\nsimple and direct ownership of the soil by the occupant.\" Since those\r\ndays Henry George has come and (alas!) gone. A craze for the\r\nnationalization of the land buzzes in the bonnets of all who have no\r\nland. There is an equal reluctance on the part of colonial\r\nlegislatures to grant waste lands as freeholds and on the part of\r\npurchasers to accept them on any other terms. Hence the constant\r\neffort to devise a tenure which shall reserve the rights of the colony\r\nand yet not oppress the tenant. One legislature has blasphemed into\r\nthe \"eternal lease,\" which would seem to be almost preferable to\r\nabsolute ownership in a country subject to earthquakes! But the\r\ntenure in the early days is unimportant. With a virgin soil yielding\r\nat first seventy and then regularly forty bushels to the acre, and\r\nhigh prices ruling, the farmer can stand any tenure. Seen at market or\r\ncattle show, his equine or bovine features and firm footing on mother\r\nearth suggest a sense of solidity in the commonwealth to which he\r\nbelongs. He gives it its character. The legislature consists of his\r\nrepresentatives. Laws are passed in his interest. He controls the\r\nexecutive. His sons fill the civil service. Judges sometimes come from\r\nhis ranks, and lawyers easily fall back into them. He supports the\r\nchurches and fills them. Small towns spring up in place of the\r\npastoral villages to supply his wants. As the period of the Golden\r\nFleece was the colonial age of gold, when Jason, the wool king, made a\r\nfortune, received a baronetcy, and, returning to the mother country,\r\nfounded a county family and intermarried with the British aristocracy,\r\nso the agricultural stage is the colonial age of silver, in money as\r\nin morals. It lasted in England till well into the century, in Germany\r\ntill the other day, in France till now. It is, in the main, the stage\r\nof contemporary colonies. What brings _it_ to an end? The soil gets\r\nexhausted, prices fall, and a succession of wet seasons in New Zealand\r\nor of dry seasons in Australia or South Africa sends the farmer into\r\nthe money market. Nearly every province of almost every colony gets\r\nmortgaged up to the hilt. The foot of the land agent is on the neck of\r\nthe farmer, who becomes his tenant or serf--_adscriptus glebæ_ as much\r\nas the Old English villeins who were the ancestors of the farmer, or\r\nthe Virginia villeins who repeated in the seventeenth century the Old\r\nEnglish status. But tenancy does not always arise out of bankrupt\r\nproprietorship. A capitalist may drain an extensive marsh (like that\r\nalong the valley of the Shoalhaven River in New South Wales) and\r\ndivide the rich alluvial soil into hundreds of profitable dairy farms.\r\nMore inland marshes, like the Piako Swamp in New Zealand, have been so\r\ncompletely drained as to make the soil too dry to carry wheat, and so\r\nhave swamped both capitalists and banker. Where the squatter owner\r\nkeeps the land in his own hands, he may lease an unbroken-up tract for\r\nthree or five years to a farmer who plows and fences it, takes off\r\ncrops, pays a light rent of from five to fifteen bushels per acre, and\r\nleaves it in grass. On one tenure or another the whole colony\r\ngradually comes into cultivation.\r\n\r\nThe predominance of the agricultural interest is long threatened and\r\nat length shaken by the rise of the industrial stage. It is partly\r\nevolved from the pastoral and agricultural stages and partly\r\nindependent. Nor do these stages at once and necessarily give rise to\r\ncollective industry. In all young colonies where the population is\r\nscanty and processes are simple there are no division and no\r\nassociation of labor. The account that one of the best of American\r\nhistorians gives of the Northwest Territory might be accepted as a\r\ndescription of this primitive state, and realizes Fichte's ideal of a\r\n_geschlossener Handelstaat_ (closed trade state). Shut in by\r\nmountains, the people raised their own flax and sometimes grew their\r\nown wool, which they spun and wove at home. They made their own\r\nspinning wheels and looms, as they made their own furniture. They\r\ntanned their own leather and cobbled rude shoes of it. Of Indian-corn\r\nhusks they spun ropes and manufactured horse collars and chair\r\nbottoms. Barrels and beehives were formed of sawn hollow trees. They\r\nextracted sugar from the maple and tea from the sassafras root. Their\r\nboats were dug-out canoes. In colonies of later foundation this\r\nself-sufficing stage, which repeats an earlier period in the mother\r\ncountry than the time when the colony was given off, is dropped,\r\nthough there are traces of it everywhere to be found. Sheep countries\r\ngive birth to the woolen industry. New Zealand reduplicates the woolen\r\nmanufactures of England and, owing to protective duties, has attained\r\na deserved success. New South Wales, with finer wools, has not\r\nsucceeded, for no other apparent reason than that she refuses to\r\nimpose such duties. For it is to be observed that it is under\r\nlegislative protection--bounties, bonuses, drawbacks, export and\r\nespecially import duties--that almost every colonial industry has\r\ngrown up, as the industries of the mother country grew up. Sometimes\r\nthe profit in a particular undertaking is exactly equal to the amount\r\nof the import duty, and it is seldom greater. By taking extravagant\r\nadvantage of the liberty long refused (as leave to manufacture was\r\nlong refused to the North American colonies), but at length conceded,\r\nto impose import duties, an Australasian colony, misled as much by its\r\nown splendid energy as by evil counselors (Carlyle among them), built\r\nup a whole artificial system of industries which sank in ruinous\r\ncollapse when the boom had passed. Independent industries spring first\r\nfrom the soil. Gold and silver mining lose their wild adventurous\r\ncharacter, and become regular industries, worked by companies with\r\nextensive plants. The digging of gum in Auckland (bled from the\r\ngigantic Kauri pine) is operated by merchants who keep the gum diggers\r\nin a species of serfage. The discovery of coal makes native industries\r\npossible or remunerative, but till iron has been found the system is\r\nincomplete. All countries, and therefore all colonies, are late in\r\nreaching this stage; the most advanced contemporary colonies have not\r\nyet reached it. None the less have they followed England with swifter\r\nsteps, if with less momentum, into the modern age of iron--that\r\nBrummagem epoch which has the creation of markets for its war cry,\r\nstate socialism for its gospel, Joseph of Birmingham for its prophet,\r\nand the British Empire for its deity.\r\n\r\nThe iron age is fitly inaugurated by the most degraded relationship\r\nthat man can bear to man--that of slavery. Only the oldest of modern\r\ncolonies imitate the mother countries in passing through this stage;\r\nin those of later foundation a mere shadow of it remains, or it takes\r\nother shapes. Colonists first enslave the natives of the country where\r\nthey settle. In the South American colonies, where they went to find\r\ngold, they would work for no other purpose; they therefore needed the\r\nnatives to till the soil; they needed them also as carriers. For these\r\npurposes they were used unscrupulously. They were distributed among\r\nthe Spaniards under a system of _repartimientos_ which repeated the\r\nprovisions of Greek and Roman slavery, and was itself reduplicated\r\nthree centuries later in the convict assignment system of New South\r\nWales. With such savage cruelty was it worked that, according to the\r\ntestimony of Columbus, six sevenths of the population of Hispaniola\r\ndied under it in a few years. The same form of slavery, but of a very\r\ndifferent character, prevailed in Africa down almost to our own times.\r\nIn the British colonies it was submerged in 1834, from causes exterior\r\nto itself, by the humanitarian wave that wrecked the West Indies; in\r\nthe French colonies it was abolished by the revolutionary government\r\nof 1848; in the Dutch colonies it possibly subsists to this day.\r\nTheoretically abolished or not, the relationship between civilized\r\nwhites and savage blacks must be everywhere a modified form of\r\nslavery; and a white colonization of the African tropics can only take\r\nplace under conditions indistinguishable from a limited slavery. In\r\ncolder or younger colonies, even if a more refined sentiment had\r\npermitted it, there could be no question of enslaving the fierce red\r\nIndians, the warlike Maoris, or the intractable Australian blacks. The\r\nIndians rendered some services to the northern colonists. The Maoris\r\nworked for the first immigrants into Canterbury, but as free laborers,\r\nand the phase soon passed away as more valuable labor arrived. Blacks\r\nwere in the early years employed by the Australian settlers, but like\r\nnearly all savages they were found incapable of continuous industry.\r\nThe next step is to import slaves. To lighten the oppression of the\r\nMexicans, negroes were introduced, as they had previously been into\r\nEurope. There, and still more in the southern colonies of North\r\nAmerica, they were the chief pioneers. They cut down forests, cleared\r\nthe jungles, drained the swamps, and opened up the country. For the\r\nbest part of two hundred years the world's sugar, rice, cotton,\r\ntobacco, and indigo were grown by negro labor. The effect on the negro\r\nhimself has been to raise him one grade in the scale of being. If, as\r\nMr. Galton believes, he is naturally two grades below the European, a\r\nplace in the \"organization of labor\" will have to be found for him\r\nmidway between the white workman and the slave. It is, indeed, being\r\nfound. As a farmer the negro has totally failed. \"But he is a good\r\nlaborer under supervision. He is a success in the mines. He has found\r\nacceptance in the iron furnaces and about the coke ovens. He is in\r\ngreat demand in periods of railroad construction,\" and he is a Western\r\npioneer. Above born and bred slaves for life there is the status of\r\nimported slaves for a term. For years Kanakas, hired or captured from\r\nthe Melanesian Islands of the Pacific, were used as slaves by the\r\nsugar planters of Queensland, until the outcry in England put a stop\r\nto an ill-conducted traffic. It has since been resumed under humaner\r\nconditions, which make it as defensible as slavery can ever be.\r\nCoolies from India are imported into Fiji and Hongkong practically as\r\nfree laborers. They are also employed on board the great liners that\r\nply between India, China, Australia, and England, much to the\r\ndiscontent of the working class and to the great satisfaction of the\r\nwell-to-do, who thus gain cheaper passages and lower freights. The\r\nradical opposition is no more likely to prevent this form of native\r\nlabor from spreading to all suitable environments than the\r\nconservative opposition has prevented women from filling the\r\nemployments within their improved capacities. The ubiquitous Chinaman,\r\nagain, has imported himself into most colonies, and so long as he\r\ntakes a place that the white laborer refuses to occupy, he will\r\npresent the ugly problem of the coexistence of an indestructible alien\r\nrace with a civilized people whose type of civilization and his are\r\nirreconcilable.\r\n\r\nEuropean colonies have also known white slavery, as Greek and Roman\r\ncolonies knew it, and slavery of their own race and nation, as\r\nEuropean countries knew it. Its most degraded type has doubtless been\r\nSpanish, English, and French convictism. The Australian-English is the\r\nmost familiar and the worst. The Australian convict was a slave for\r\nlife or a long term. Like the slave, he was at the mercy of his\r\nmaster, excepting that corporal punishment could not be inflicted by\r\nthe master's hands. The lash was none the less kept going; in a single\r\nyear, in New South Wales, nearly three thousand floggings were\r\nadministered. The Roman _ergastula_ were pleasure bowers compared with\r\nthe convict hells of Parramatta, in New South Wales, and Port Arthur,\r\nin Tasmania. Marcus Clarke's terrible fiction proves to be still more\r\nterrible fact. Convicts were herded together like pigs; kindness was\r\nrare, oppression general, and many fine men died inch by inch. Such\r\nwas the state of things even after the introduction of the assignment\r\nsystem. According to that system, convicts were assigned as\r\nagricultural laborers and shepherds to settlers who cried out for\r\nthem, as the American planters did for slaves. Craftsmen were allotted\r\nto high officials in lieu of salary or to influential persons who\r\nhired them to others (herein repeating English serfdom) or permitted\r\nthem to work for themselves, receiving a portion of their earnings\r\n(herein repeating Greek slavery). Mechanics were employed on public\r\nworks, and hundreds of buildings were erected by convict masons,\r\nbricklayers, and carpenters. Day laborers were employed on roads, and\r\nhundreds of miles of solid highway are a durable monument to the\r\nmemory of the convict. They were the true pioneers of the country,\r\nbraving the dangers of the \"bush,\" resisting the aborigines, clearing\r\nand cultivating the land, and developing the resources of the\r\ncolonies. For themselves they did well and ill. Many reformed, and\r\nafter manumission, which was at first special and at length general,\r\nbecame respectable citizens, dealers, and traders. Some grew to be\r\nprosperous merchants, wealthy squatters, editors, legislators, and all\r\nbut ministers. Their sons are judges, legislators, solicitors,\r\nGovernment officials, newspaper proprietors. After lasting for sixty\r\nyears the system of transportation was at length abolished in\r\nconsequence of the opposition of the working class, who objected to\r\ncompetition, and of the respectable classes generally. The legislative\r\nbody and the large landowners were rather in favor of its perpetuity,\r\nand there are still members of the old \"slave-driving party\" in\r\nTasmania who regret its discontinuance.\r\n\r\nThe bond servants, who were common in New England and at first more\r\nnumerous than slaves in the Southern States, repeated the status of\r\nthe English serfs. Their origin was various. Crime, debt, sale by\r\nparents, voluntary surrender, and kidnapping all contributed their\r\nquota. The period of indentured service was at first from seven to ten\r\nyears, and was ultimately reduced to a fixed term of four years. They\r\nwere exchanged and sold like any other commodity. Their treatment\r\nseems to have been often harsh. Like the Australian convicts, many of\r\nthem prospered. Leading families in the United States trace their\r\norigin to bondmen. Not a few of the Southern overseers, free laborers,\r\nand small farmers are believed to be descended from them. The vagabond\r\nelement in all the States, the \"white trash\" of the South, and the\r\ncriminal and pauper inhabitants of certain regions in the North are\r\nalso affiliated on the more degraded sections of the class.[4]\r\n\r\nThe worst of modern inventions, it has been said, is the invention of\r\nthe workingman. The workingman, however, has a pedigree; he is the son\r\nof the bondman or the serf, and the grandson of the slave, who would\r\nhave been still more discreditable \"inventions\" if they had not been\r\nthe outgrowth of their time and place. The servile character of the\r\nworkman long survived in European countries; it was not till the\r\nbeginning of this century that the last trades were emancipated in\r\nEngland. While in North America and New South Wales the transition is\r\nplainly traceable, all vestiges of it have disappeared in the younger\r\ncolonies. In these, almost from the first, the mechanic is master of\r\nthe situation. The carpenter who can put up a wooden cottage commands\r\nregular work and high wages, while the preacher who builds him a house\r\nnot made with hands is starved. The anomaly is in perfect consistency\r\nwith the biological analogy; the brain is everywhere of late\r\ndevelopment. As the colony grows, wages fall, and the position of\r\nprofessional men becomes more tolerable, but, _en revanche_, the\r\nworkman acquires and at length almost monopolizes political power. The\r\npremier and cabinet ministers are sometimes former peddlers, gold\r\ndiggers, coal miners, shepherds, etc. The legislative bodies consist\r\nlargely of labor representatives. Laws are passed in the interest of\r\nlabor. Not content with a share of political power out of all\r\nproportion to their numbers or importance, the regimented trades,\r\nunder the command of unscrupulous leaders, deliver a pitched battle\r\nagainst the employers, with the object of gaining practical possession\r\nof the agencies of production and distribution. They are necessarily\r\ndefeated. The value of labor and the importance of the mechanic\r\ndecline with the application of machinery to all industrial processes.\r\nAccumulated wealth, subsidizing inventions, acquires an increasing\r\nascendency. The industrial system is in no greater danger from the\r\nonslaughts of labor than civilized countries from the invasion of\r\nbarbarians.\r\n\r\nOnly the beginnings of the commercial epoch, or age of bronze, are to\r\nbe found in colonies. In production we witness the same supersession\r\nof individual enterprise by the limited liability company. This is\r\nalso the case in distribution, where many obsolete Old World stages\r\nare recapitulated. We may still see the long, slow bullock team, the\r\nwearied pack horse (the fur trade in Canada was carried on by\r\n\"brigades of pack horses\"), the hawker, purveyor of news and gossip.\r\nWe easily trace the evolution of the shop: at first a ship, then\r\nlanded, with everything inside--groceries, meat, bread, fruit, and\r\nvegetables, clothes, crockery, ironmongery, stationery, and tobacco;\r\nthe butcher first hives off, then the baker, the grocer; in course of\r\ntime reintegration takes place, and shops are to be found in the\r\ncolonial cities which reduplicate Whiteley's in London, where\r\neverything may again be had as in the beginning. The processes of\r\nexchange likewise recapitulate the past. Barter is long universal, and\r\nis still common in colonial villages. Even then a standard is needed.\r\nIn the Old English period the \"currency\" consisted of cattle, named by\r\na facetious writer \"the current _kine_ of the realm.\" In Virginia and\r\nMaryland tobacco was the circulating medium for a century and a half,\r\nsupplemented in Maryland with hemp and flax; taxes were paid in\r\ntobacco, and rent in kind. In Illinois and Canada, skins and furs,\r\nwith wampum for small coin; in New England the latter singular\r\ncurrency was used far into the eighteenth century. New South Wales has\r\nthe demerit of inventing the destructive medium of rum; wages were\r\npaid in it or in wheat; meal or spirits were taken at the doors of\r\ntheaters. Store receipts for produce were given by the Government and\r\npassed current, not without depreciation; military officers issued\r\nbills for all sums up to one hundred pounds; private individuals, in\r\nthe lack of specie, gave promissory notes. Fixed prices were long\r\nunknown; extortioners in the early days of all the colonies made a\r\nprofit of a thousand per cent; and in quite recent days usurious\r\nattorneys exacted interest at the rate of a hundred per cent.\r\n\r\nColonies sometimes anticipate the development of the mother country.\r\nThe communistic dreams of the forties in France and England were for a\r\nbrief while realized in old Virginia, as they are at this hour being\r\nrealized in the village settlements of South Australia; and the state\r\nsocialism rendered popular by the German victories of 1870 was perhaps\r\nmore thoroughly embodied in convict New South Wales than anywhere else\r\noutside of Peru under the Incas, as it is now sweeping all of the\r\nAustralasian colonies onward to an unknown goal.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] In its primary American sense the word _squatter_ denotes the\r\nbackwoodsman described in the foregoing paragraph.

This is the\r\ntruth, but not the whole truth. Indispensable as are the sense organs\r\nin gaining an acquaintance with the world in which we live, yet they\r\nalone do not determine how extensive or how accurate that acquaintance\r\nshall be. There is a mind behind the eye and the ear and the finger\r\ntips which guides them in gathering information, and gives value and\r\norder to the exercise of the senses. This is particularly true of\r\nvision, the most intellectual of all the senses, the one in which mere\r\nacuteness of the sense organ counts least and the training in\r\nobservation counts most. The eagle's eye sees farther, but our eyes\r\ntell us much more of what is seen.\r\n\r\nThe eye is often compared to a photographic camera, with its eyelid\r\ncap, its iris shutter, its lens, and its sensitive plate--the retina;\r\nwhen properly adjusted for distance and light, the image is formed on\r\nthe retina as on the glass plate, and the picture is taken. So far the\r\ncomparison is helpful; but while the camera takes a picture whenever\r\nand wherever the plate happens to be exposed, the complete act of\r\nseeing requires some co-operation on the part of the mind. The retina\r\nmay be exposed a thousand times and take but few pictures; or perhaps\r\nit is better to say that the pictures may be taken, but remain\r\nundeveloped and evanescent. The pictures that are developed are\r\nstacked up, like the negatives in the photographer's shop, in the\r\npigeonholes of our mental storerooms--some faded and blurred, some\r\npoorly arranged or mislaid, some often referred to and fresh prints\r\nmade therefrom, and some quite neglected.\r\n\r\nIn order to see, it is at once necessary that the retina be suitably\r\nexposed toward the object to be seen, and that the mind be favorably\r\ndisposed to the assimilation of the impression. True seeing,\r\nobserving, is a double process, partly objective or outward--the thing\r\nseen and the retina--and partly subjective or inward--the picture\r\nmysteriously transferred to the mind's representative, the brain, and\r\nthere received and affiliated with other images. Illustrations of such\r\nseeing \"with the mind's eye\" are not far to seek. Wherever the\r\nbeauties and conformations of natural scenery invite the eye of man\r\ndoes he discover familiar forms and faces (Fig. 1); the forces of\r\nNature have rough-hewn the rocks, but the human eye detects and often\r\ncreates the resemblances. The stranger to whom such curiosities of\r\nform are first pointed out often finds it difficult to discover the\r\nresemblance, but once seen the face or form obtrudes itself in every\r\nview and seems the most conspicuous feature in the outlook. The\r\nflickering fire furnishes a fine background for the activity of the\r\nmind's eye, and against this it projects the forms and fancies which\r\nthe leaping flames and the burning embers from time to time suggest.\r\nNot all see these fire-pictures readily, for our mental eyes differ\r\nmore from one another than the physical ones, and perhaps no two\r\npersons see the same picture in quite the same way. It is not quite\r\ntrue, however, as many have held, that in waking hours we all have a\r\nworld in common, but in dreams each has a world of his own, for our\r\nwaking worlds are made different by the differences in what engages\r\nour interest and our attention. It is true that our eyes when open are\r\nopened very largely to the same views, but by no one observer are all\r\nthese views, though visible, really seen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.[5]--The man's face in the rocks is quite\r\ndistinct, and is usually readily found when it is known that there is\r\na face somewhere. (For this view from the Dalles of the St. Croix,\r\nMinn., I am indebted to the courtesy of Mr. W. H. Dudley, of Madison,\r\nWis.)]\r\n\r\nThis characteristic of human vision often serves as a source of\r\namusement. The puzzle picture with its tantalizing face, or animal, or\r\nwhat not, hidden in the trees, or fantastically constructed out of\r\nheterogeneous elements that make up the composition, is to many quite\r\nirresistible. We turn it about in all directions, wondering where the\r\nhidden form can be, scanning every detail of the picture, until\r\nsuddenly a chance glimpse reveals it, plainly staring us in the face.\r\nWhen several persons are engaged in this occupation, it is amusing to\r\nobserve how blind each is to what the others see; their physical eyes\r\nsee alike, but their mental eyes reflect their own individualities.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--In order to see the lion's head, hold the\r\ndollar exactly inverted and the head will be discovered facing the\r\nleft, as above outlined. It is clearer on the dollar itself than in\r\nthis reproduction.]\r\n\r\nThousands upon thousands of persons handle our silver dollar, but few\r\nhappen to observe the lion's head which lies concealed in the\r\nrepresentation of the familiar head of Liberty; frequently even a\r\ncareful examination fails to detect this hidden emblem of British\r\nrule; but, as before, when once found, it is quite obvious (Fig. 2).\r\nFor similar reasons it is a great aid in looking for an object to know\r\nwhat to look for; to be readily found, the object, though lost to\r\nsight, should be to memory clear. Searching is a mental process\r\nsimilar to the matching of a piece of fabric in texture or color, when\r\none has forgotten the sample and must rely upon the remembrance of its\r\nappearance. If the recollection is clear and distinct, recognition\r\ntakes place when the judgment decides that what the physical eye sees\r\ncorresponds to the image in the mind's eye; with an indistinct mental\r\nimage the recognition becomes doubtful or faulty. The novice in the\r\nuse of the microscope experiences considerable difficulty in observing\r\nthe appearance which his instructor sees and describes, and this\r\nbecause his conception of the object to be seen is lacking in\r\nprecision. Hence his training in the use of the microscope is\r\ndistinctly aided by consulting the illustrations in the text-book, for\r\nthey enable his mental eye to realize the pictures which it should\r\nentertain. He may be altogether too much influenced by the pictures\r\nthus suggested to his mental vision, and draw what is really not under\r\nhis microscope at all; much as the young arithmetician will manage to\r\nobtain the answer which the book requires even at the cost of a resort\r\nto very unmathematical processes. For training in correct and accurate\r\nvision it is necessary to acquire an alert mental eye that observes\r\nall that is objectively visible, but does not permit the subjective to\r\nadd to or modify what is really present.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--Observe the appearance of these letters at a\r\ndistance of eight to twelve feet. An interesting method of testing the\r\nactivity of the mind's eye with these letters is described in the\r\ntext.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3_a_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3_b_.]\r\n\r\nThe importance of the mind's eye in ordinary vision is also well\r\nillustrated in cases in which we see or seem to see what is not really\r\npresent, but what for one cause or another it is natural to suppose is\r\npresent. A very familiar instance of this process is the constant\r\noverlooking of misprints--false letters, transposed letters, and\r\nmissing letters--unless these happen to be particularly striking. We\r\nsee only the general physiognomy of the word and the detailed features\r\nare supplied from within; in this case it is the expected that\r\nhappens. Reading is done largely by the mental eye; and entire words,\r\nobviously suggested by the context, are sometimes read in, when they\r\nhave been accidentally omitted. This is more apt to occur with the\r\nirregular characters used in manuscript than in the more distinct\r\nforms of the printed alphabet, and is particularly frequent in reading\r\nover what one has himself written. In reading proof, however, we are\r\neager to detect misprints, and this change in attitude helps to make\r\nthem visible. It is difficult to illustrate this process\r\nintentionally, because the knowledge that one's powers of observation\r\nare about to be tested places one on one's guard, and thus suppresses\r\nthe natural activity of the mind's eye and draws unusual attention to\r\nobjective details. Let the reader at this point hold the page at some\r\ndistance off--say, eight or twelve feet--and draw an exact\r\nreproduction of the letters shown in Fig. 3. Let him not read further\r\nuntil this has been done, and _perhaps_ he may find that he has\r\nintroduced strokes which were not present in the original. If this is\r\nnot the case, let him try the test upon those who are ignorant of its\r\nnature, and he will find that most persons will supply light lines to\r\ncomplete the contours of the letters which in the original are\r\nsuggested but not really present; the original outline, Fig. 3_a_,\r\nbecomes something like Fig. 3_b_, and so on for the rest of the\r\nletters. The physical eye sees the former, but the mental eye sees the\r\nlatter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.--For description, see text.]\r\n\r\nI tried this experiment with a class of over thirty university\r\nstudents of Psychology, and, although they were disposed to be quite\r\ncritical and suspected some kind of an illusion, only three or four\r\ndrew the letters correctly; all the rest filled in the imaginary light\r\ncontours; some even drew them as heavily as the real strokes. I\r\nfollowed this by an experiment of a similar character. I placed upon\r\na table a figure (Fig. 4) made of light cardboard, fastened to blocks\r\nof wood at the base so that the pieces would easily stand upright. The\r\nmiddle piece, which is rectangular and high, was placed a little in\r\nfront of the rest of the figure. The students were asked to describe\r\nprecisely what they saw, and with one exception they all described, in\r\ndifferent words, a semicircular piece of cardboard with a rectangular\r\npiece in front of it. In reality there was no half-circle of\r\ncardboard, but only parts of two quarter-circles. The students, of\r\ncourse, were well aware that their physical eyes could not see what\r\nwas behind the middle cardboard, but they inferred that the two side\r\npieces were parts of one continuous semicircle. This they saw, so far\r\nas they saw it at all, with their mind's eye.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--The black and white portions of this design\r\nare precisely alike, but the effect of looking at the figure as a\r\npattern in black upon a white background, or as a pattern in white\r\nupon a black background, is quite different, although the difference\r\nis not easily described.]\r\n\r\nThere is a further interesting class of illustrations in which a\r\nsingle outward impression changes its character according as it is\r\nviewed as representing one thing or another. In a general way we see\r\nthe same thing all the time, and the image on the retina does not\r\nchange. But as we shift the attention from one portion of the view to\r\nanother, or as we view it with a different mental conception of what\r\nthe figure represents, it assumes a different aspect, and to our\r\nmental eye becomes quite a different thing. A slight but interesting\r\nchange takes place if we view Fig. 5 first with the conception that\r\nthe black is the pattern to be seen and the white the background, and\r\nagain try to see the white as the pattern against a black background.\r\nI give a further illustration of such a change in Fig. 6. In our\r\nfirst and natural view of this we focus the attention upon the black\r\nlines and observe the familiar illusion, that the four vertical lines\r\nseem far from parallel. That they are parallel can be verified by\r\nmeasurement, or by covering up all of the diagram except the four main\r\nlines. But if the white part of the diagram is conceived as the design\r\nagainst a black background, then the design is no longer the same, and\r\nwith this change the illusion appears, and the four lines seem\r\nparallel, as they really are. It may require a little effort to bring\r\nabout this change, but it is very marked when once realised.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.--When this figure is viewed as a black pattern\r\non a white background, the four main vertical lines seem far from\r\nparallel; when it is viewed as a white pattern on a black background\r\nthis illusion disappears (or nearly so), and the black lines as well\r\nas the white ones seem parallel.]\r\n\r\nA curious optical effect which in part illustrates the change in\r\nappearance under different aspects is reproduced in Fig. 7. In this\r\ncase the enchantment of distance is necessary to produce the\r\ntransformation. Viewed at the usual reading distance, we see nothing\r\nbut an irregular and meaningless assemblage of black and white\r\nblotches. At a distance of fifteen to eighteen feet, however, a man's\r\nhead appears quite clearly. Also observe that after the head has once\r\nbeen realized it becomes possible to obtain suggestions of it at\r\nnearer distances.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.--This is a highly enlarged reproduction taken\r\nfrom a half-tone process print of Lord Kelvin. It appeared in the\r\nPhotographic Times.]\r\n\r\nA much larger class of ambiguous diagrams consists of those which\r\nrepresent by simple outlines familiar geometrical forms or objects. We\r\ncultivate such a use of our eyes, as indeed of all our faculties, as\r\nwill on the whole lead to the most profitable results. As a rule, the\r\nparticular impression is not so important as what it represents. Sense\r\nimpressions are simply the symbols or signs of things or ideas, and\r\nthe thing or the idea is more important than the sign. Accordingly, we\r\nare accustomed to interpret lines, whenever we can, as the\r\nrepresentations of objects. We are well aware that the canvas or the\r\netching or the photograph before us is a flat surface in two\r\ndimensions, but we see the picture as the representation of solid\r\nobjects in three dimensions. This is the illusion of pictorial art. So\r\nstrong is this tendency to view lines as the symbols of things that if\r\nthere is the slightest chance of so viewing them, we invariably do so;\r\nfor we have a great deal of experience with things that present their\r\ncontours as lines, and very little with mere lines or surfaces. If we\r\nview outlines only, without shading or perspective or anything to\r\ndefinitely suggest what is foreground and what background, it becomes\r\npossible for the mind to supply these details and see foreground as\r\nbackground, and _vice versa_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.--This drawing may be viewed as the\r\nrepresentation of a book standing on its half-opened covers as seen\r\nfrom the back of the book; or as the inside view of an open book\r\nshowing the pages.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.--When this figure is viewed as an arrow, the\r\nupper or feathered end seems flat; when the rest of the arrow is\r\ncovered, the feathered end may be made to project or recede like the\r\nbook cover in Fig. 8.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.--The smaller square may be regarded as either\r\nthe nearer face of a projecting figure or as the more distant face of\r\na hollow figure.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.--This represents an ordinary table-glass, the\r\nbottom of the glass and the entire rear side, except the upper\r\nportion, being seen through the transparent nearer side, and the rear\r\napparently projecting above the front. But it fluctuates in appearance\r\nbetween this and a view of the glass in which the bottom is seen\r\ndirectly, partly from underneath, the _whole_ of the rear side is seen\r\nthrough the transparent front, and the front projects above the back.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.--In this scroll the left half may at first\r\nseem concave and the right convex, it then seems to roll or advance\r\nlike a wave, and the left seems convex and the right concave, as\r\nthough the trough of the wave had become the crest, and _vice versa_.]\r\n\r\nA good example to begin with is Fig. 8. These outlines will probably\r\nsuggest at first view a book, or better a book cover, seen with its\r\nback toward you and its sides sloping away from you; but it may also\r\nbe viewed as a book opened out toward you and presenting to you an\r\ninside view of its contents. Should the change not come readily, it\r\nmay be facilitated by thinking persistently of the appearance of an\r\nopen book in this position. The upper portion of Fig. 9 is practically\r\nthe same as Fig. 8, and if the rest of the figure be covered up, it\r\nwill change as did the book cover; when, however, the whole figure is\r\nviewed as an arrow, a new conception enters, and the apparently solid\r\nbook cover becomes the _flat_ feathered part of the arrow. Look at the\r\nnext figure (Fig. 10), which represents in outline a truncated pyramid\r\nwith a square base. Is the smaller square nearer to you, and are the\r\nsides of the pyramid sloping away from you toward the larger square in\r\nthe rear? Or are you looking into the hollow of a truncated pyramid\r\nwith the smaller square in the background? Or is it now one and now\r\nthe other, according as you decide to see it? Here (Fig. 13) is a\r\nskeleton box which you may conceive as made of wires outlining the\r\nsides. Now the front, or side nearest to me, seems directed downward\r\nand to the left; again, it has shifted its position and is no longer\r\nthe front, and the side which appears to be the front seems directed\r\nupward and to the right. The presence of the diagonal line makes the\r\nchange more striking: in one position it runs from the left-hand\r\n_rear_ upper corner to the right-hand _front_ lower corner; while in\r\nthe other it connects the left-hand _front_ upper corner with the\r\nright-hand _rear_ lower corner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGS. 13, 13_a_, and 13_b_.--The two methods of viewing\r\nFig. 13 are described in the text. Figs. 13_a_ and 13_b_ are added to\r\nmake clearer the two methods of viewing Fig. 13. The heavier lines\r\nseem to represent the nearer surface. Fig. 13_a_ more naturally\r\nsuggests the nearer surface of the box in a position downward and to\r\nthe left, and Fig. 13_b_ makes the nearer side seem to be upward and\r\nto the right. But in spite of the heavier outlines of the one surface,\r\nit may be made to shift positions from foreground to background,\r\nalthough not so readily as in Fig. 13.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.--Each member of this frieze represents a\r\nrelief ornament, applied upon the background, which in cross-section\r\nwould be an isosceles triangle with a large obtuse angle, or a space\r\nof similar shape hollowed out of the solid wood or stone. In running\r\nthe eye along the pattern, it is interesting to observe how variously\r\nthe patterns fluctuate from one of these aspects to the other.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGS. 15, 15_a_, and 15_b_.--The two views of Fig. 15\r\ndescribed in the text are brought out more clearly in Figs. 15_a_ and\r\n15_b_. The shaded portion tends to be regarded as the nearer face.\r\nFig. 15_a_ is more apt to suggest the steps seen as we ascend them.\r\nFig. 15_b_ seems to represent the hollowed-out structure underneath\r\nthe steps. But even with the shading the dual interpretation is\r\npossible, although less obvious.]\r\n\r\nFig. 15 will probably seen at first glimpse to be the view of a flight\r\nof steps which one is about to ascend from right to left. Imagine it,\r\nhowever, to be a view of the under side of a series of steps; the view\r\nrepresenting the structure of overhanging solid masonwork seen from\r\nunderneath. At first it may be difficult to see it thus, because the\r\nview of steps which we are about to mount is a more natural and\r\nfrequent experience than the other; but by staring at it with the\r\nintention of seeing it differently the transition will come, and often\r\nquite unexpectedly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.--This interesting figure (which is reproduced\r\nwith modifications from Scripture--The New Psychology) is subject in a\r\nstriking way to interchanges between foreground and background. Most\r\npersons find it difficult to maintain for any considerable time either\r\naspect of the blocks (these aspects are described in the text); some\r\ncan change them at will, others must accept the changes as they happen\r\nto come.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 17_a_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 17_b_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 17.\r\n\r\nFIGS. 17, 17_a_, and 17_b_.--How many blocks are there in this pile?\r\nSix or seven? Note the change in arrangement of the blocks as they\r\nchange in number from six to seven. This change is illustrated in the\r\ntext. Figs. 17_a_ and 17_b_ show the two phases of a group of any\r\nthree of the blocks. The arrangement of a pyramid of six blocks seems\r\nthe more stable and is usually first suggested; but hold the page\r\ninverted, and you will probably see the alternate arrangement (with,\r\nhowever, the black surfaces still forming the tops). And once knowing\r\nwhat to look for, you will very likely be able to see either\r\narrangement, whether the diagram be held inverted or not. This method\r\nof viewing the figures upside down and in other positions is also\r\nsuggested to bring out the changes indicated in Figs. 13, 13_a_,\r\n13_b_, and in Figs. 15, 15_a_, 15_b_.]\r\n\r\nThe blocks in Fig. 16 are subject to a marked fluctuation. Now the\r\nblack surfaces represent the bottoms of the blocks, all pointing\r\ndownward and to the left, and now the black surfaces have changed and\r\nhave become the tops pointing upward and to the right. For some the\r\nchanges come at will; for others they seem to come unexpectedly, but\r\nall are aided by anticipating mentally the nature of the\r\ntransformation. The effect here is quite striking, the blocks seeming\r\nalmost animated and moving through space. In Fig. 17 a similar\r\narrangement serves to create an illusion as to the real number of\r\nblocks present. If viewed in one way--the black surface forming the\r\ntops of the blocks--there seem to be six arranged as in Fig. 18; but\r\nwhen the transformation has taken place and the black surfaces have\r\nbecome the overhanging bottoms of the boxes, there are seven, arranged\r\nas in Fig. 19. Somewhat different, but still belonging to the group of\r\nambiguous figures, is the ingenious conceit of the duck-rabbit shown\r\nin Fig. 20. When it is a rabbit, the face looks to the right and a\r\npair of ears are conspicuous behind; when it is a duck, the face looks\r\nto the left and the ears have been changed into the bill. Most\r\nobservers find it difficult to hold either interpretation steadily,\r\nthe fluctuations being frequent, and coming as a surprise.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.--Do you see a duck or a rabbit, or either?\r\n(From Harper's Weekly, originally in Fliegende Blätter.)]\r\n\r\nAll these diagrams serve to illustrate the principle that when the\r\nobjective features are ambiguous we see one thing or another according\r\nto the impression that is in the mind's eye; what the objective\r\nfactors lack in definiteness the subjective ones supply, while\r\nfamiliarity, prepossession, as well as other circumstances influence\r\nthe result. These illustrations show conclusively that seeing is not\r\nwholly an objective matter depending upon what there is to be seen,\r\nbut is very considerably a subjective matter depending upon the eye\r\nthat sees. To the same observer a given arrangement of lines now\r\nappears as the representation of one object and now of another; and\r\nfrom the same objective experience, especially in instances that\r\ndemand a somewhat complicated exercise of the senses, different\r\nobservers derive very different impressions.\r\n\r\nNot only when the sense-impressions are ambiguous or defective, but\r\nwhen they are vague--when the light is dim or the forms obscure--does\r\nthe mind's eye eke out the imperfections of physical vision. The vague\r\nconformations of drapery and make-up that are identified and\r\nrecognized in spiritualistic _séances_ illustrate extreme instances of\r\nthis process. The whitewashed tree or post that momentarily startles\r\nus in a dark country lane takes on the guise that expectancy gives it.\r\nThe mental predisposition here becomes the dominant factor, and the\r\ntimid see as ghosts what their more sturdy companions recognize as\r\nwhitewashed posts. Such experiences we ascribe to the action of\r\nsuggestion and the imagination--the cloud \"that's almost in shape like\r\na camel,\" or \"like a weasel,\" or \"like a whale.\" But throughout our\r\nvisual experiences there runs this double strain, now mainly outward\r\nand now mainly inward, from the simplest excitements of the retina up\r\nto the realms where fancy soars freed from the confines of sense, and\r\nthe objective finds its occupation gone.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[5] In order to obtain the effects described in the various\r\nillustrations it is necessary in several cases to regard the figures\r\nfor a considerable time and with close attention. The reader is\r\nrequested not to give up in case the first attempt to secure the\r\neffect is not successful, but to continue the effort for a reasonable\r\nperiod. Individuals differ considerably in the readiness with which\r\nthey obtain such effects; in some cases, such devices as holding the\r\ndiagrams inverted or at an angle or viewing them with the eyes half\r\nclosed are helpful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURE STUDY IN THE PHILADELPHIA NORMAL SCHOOL.\r\n\r\nBY L. L. W. WILSON, PH. D.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen it was first proposed to me to write for the Popular Science\r\nMonthly a brief account of the biological laboratories in the\r\nPhiladelphia Normal School, and of the Nature work carried on under my\r\ndirection in the School of Observation and Practice, I felt that I\r\ncould not do justice either to the place or the work; for, in my\r\njudgment, the equipment of the laboratories and the work done in\r\nconnection with them are finer than anything else of the kind either\r\nin this country or abroad--a statement which it seemed to me that I\r\ncould not make with becoming modesty. But, after all, it is not great\r\nBabylon that I have built, but a Babylon builded for me, and to fail\r\nto express my sense of its worth is to fail to do justice to Dr. W. P.\r\nWilson, formerly of the University of Pennsylvania, to whom their\r\ninception was due; to Mr. Simon Gratz, president of the Board of\r\nEducation, who from the beginning appreciated their value, and without\r\nwhose aid they never would have taken visible form; to the principals\r\nof the two schools, and, above all, to my five assistants, whose\r\nknowledge, zeal, and hard work have contributed more than anything\r\nelse to the rapid building up of the work.\r\n\r\nTHE LABORATORIES AND THEIR EQUIPMENT.--The rooms occupied by the\r\nbotanical and zoölogical departments of the normal school measure each\r\nseventy by twenty feet. A small workroom for the teachers cuts off\r\nabout ten feet of this length from each room. In the middle of the\r\nremaining space stands a demonstration table furnished with hot and\r\ncold water. Each laboratory is lighted from the side by ten windows.\r\nFrom them extend the tables for the students. These give plenty of\r\ndrawer space and closets for dissecting and compound microscopes.\r\nThose in the zoölogical room are also provided with sinks. Each\r\nstudent is furnished with the two microscopes, stage and eyepiece\r\nmicrometers, a drawing camera, a set of dissecting instruments,\r\nglassware, note-books, text-books, and general literature.\r\n\r\nThe walls opposite the windows are in both rooms lined with cases, in\r\nwhich there is a fine synoptic series.\r\n\r\nIn the botanical laboratory this systematic collection begins with\r\nmodels of bacteria and ends with trees. In other cases, placed in the\r\nadjoining corridor, are representatives, either in alcohol or by means\r\nof models, of most of the orders of flowering plants, as well as a\r\nseries illustrating the history of the theory of cross-fertilization,\r\nand the various devices by which it is accomplished; another, showing\r\nthe different methods of distribution of seeds and fruits; another,\r\nof parasitic plants; and still another showing the various devices by\r\nmeans of which plants catch animals.\r\n\r\nAs an example of the graphic and thorough way in which these\r\nillustrations are worked out, the pines may be cited. There are\r\nfossils; fine specimens of pistillate and staminate flowers in\r\nalcohol; cones; a drawing of the pollen; large models of the flowers;\r\nmodels of the seeds, showing the embryo and the various stages of\r\ngermination; cross and longitudinal sections of the wood; drawings\r\nshowing its microscopic structure; pictures of adult trees; and\r\nsamples illustrating their economic importance. For the last, the\r\nlong-leaved pine of the South is used, and samples are exhibited of\r\nthe turpentine, crude and refined; tar and the oil of tar; resin; the\r\nleaves; the same boiled in potash; the same hatcheled into wool; yarn,\r\nbagging and rope made from the wool; and its timber split, sawn, and\r\ndressed.\r\n\r\nThe series illustrating the fertilization of flowers begins with a\r\nlarge drawing, adapted by one of the students from Gibson, showing the\r\ngradual evolution of the belief in cross-fertilization from 1682, when\r\nNehemiah Grew first declared that seed would not set unless pollen\r\nreached the stigma, down to Darwin, who first demonstrated the\r\nadvantages of cross-fertilization and showed many of the devices of\r\nplants by which this is accomplished. The special devices are then\r\nillustrated with models and large drawings. First comes the dimorphic\r\nprimrose; then follows trimorphic _Lythrum_, to the beautiful model of\r\nwhich is appended a copy of the letter in which Darwin wrote to Gray\r\nof his discovery:\r\n\r\n     \"But I am almost stark, staring mad over Lythrum.... I\r\n     should rather like seed of Mitchella. But, oh, Lythrum!\r\n\r\n                                         \"Your utterly mad friend,\r\n                                                          \"C. DARWIN.\"\r\n\r\nModels of the cucumber, showing the process of its formation, and the\r\nunisexual flowers complete this series. Supplementing this are models\r\nand drawings of a large number of flowers, illustrating special\r\ndevices by which cross-fertilization is secured, such as the larkspur,\r\nbutter and eggs, orchids, iris, salvia, several composites, the\r\nmilkweed, and, most interesting of all, the Dutchman's pipe. This is a\r\nflower that entices flies into its curved trumpet and keeps them there\r\nuntil they become covered with the ripe pollen. Then the hairs wither,\r\nthe tube changes its position, the fly is permitted to leave, carrying\r\nthe pollen thus acquired to another flower with the same result.\r\n\r\nPictures and small busts of many naturalists adorn both of the rooms.\r\nOf these the most notable is an artist proof of Mercier's beautiful\r\netching of Darwin. Every available inch of wall space is thus\r\noccupied, or else, in the botanical laboratory, has on it mounted\r\nfungi, lichens, seaweeds, leaf cards, pictures of trees, grasses, and\r\nother botanical objects.\r\n\r\nThe windows are beautiful with hanging plants from side brackets\r\nmeeting the wealth of green on the sill. Here are found in one window\r\nferns, in another the century plant; in others still, specimens of\r\neconomic plants--cinnamon, olive, banana, camphor. On the tables are\r\nmagnificent specimens of palms, cycads, dracænas, and aspidistras, and\r\nnumerous aquaria filled with various water plants. Most of these\r\nplants are four years old, and all of them are much handsomer than\r\nwhen they first became the property of the laboratory. How much\r\nintelligent and patient care this means only those who have attempted\r\nto raise plants in city houses can know.\r\n\r\nThe zoölogical laboratory is quite as beautiful as the botanical, for\r\nit, too, has its plants and pictures. It is perhaps more interesting\r\nbecause of its living elements. Think of a schoolroom in which are\r\nrepresented alive types of animals as various as these: amoeba,\r\nvorticella, hydra, worms, muscles, snails and slugs of various kinds,\r\ncrayfish, various insects, including a hive of Italian bees, goldfish,\r\nminnows, dace, catfish, sunfish, eels, tadpoles, frogs, newts,\r\nsalamanders, snakes, alligators, turtles, pigeons, canaries, mice,\r\nguinea-pigs, rabbits, squirrels, and a monkey! Imagine these living\r\nanimals supplemented by models of their related antediluvian forms, or\r\nfossils, by carefully labeled dissections, by preparations and\r\npictures illustrating their development and mode of life; imagine in\r\naddition to this books, pamphlets, magazines, and teachers further to\r\nput you in touch with this wonderful world about us, and you will then\r\nhave some idea of the environment in which it is the great privilege\r\nof our students to live for five hours each week.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these laboratories there is a lecture room furnished\r\nwith an electric lantern. Here each week is given a lecture on general\r\ntopics, such as evolution and its problems, connected with the work of\r\nthe laboratories.\r\n\r\nTHE COURSE OF STUDY PURSUED BY THE NORMAL STUDENTS.--Botany: In\r\ngeneral, the plants and the phenomena of the changing seasons are\r\nstudied as they occur in Nature. In the fall there are lessons on the\r\ncomposites and other autumn flowers, on fruits, on the ferns, mosses,\r\nfungi, and other cryptogams. In the winter months the students grow\r\nvarious seeds at home, carefully drawing and studying every stage in\r\ntheir development. Meanwhile, in the laboratory, they examine\r\nmicroscopically and macroscopically the seeds themselves and the\r\nvarious food supplies stored within. By experimentation they get\r\ngeneral ideas of plant physiology, beginning with the absorption of\r\nwater by seeds, the change of the food supply to soluble sugar, the\r\nmethod of growth, the functions, the histology, and the modifications\r\nof stem, root, and leaves. In the spring they study the buds and\r\ntrees, particularly the conifers, and the different orders of\r\nflowering plants.\r\n\r\nThe particular merit of the work is that it is so planned that each\r\nlaboratory lesson compels the students to reason. Having once thus\r\nobtained their information, they are required to drill themselves out\r\nof school hours until the facts become an integral part of their\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\nFor the study of fruits, for example, they are given large trays, each\r\ndivided into sixteen compartments, plainly labeled with the name of\r\nthe seed or fruit within. Then, by means of questions, the students\r\nare made to read for themselves the story which each fruit has to\r\ntell, to compare it with the others, and to deduce from this\r\ncomparison certain general laws.\r\n\r\nAfter sufficient laboratory practice of this kind they are required to\r\nread parts of Lubbock's Flower, Fruit, and Leaves, Kerner's Natural\r\nHistory of Plants, Wallace's Tropical Nature, and Darwinism, etc.\r\n\r\nFinally, they are each given a type-written summary of the work, and\r\nafter a week's notice are required to pass a written examination.\r\n\r\nZoölogy: The course begins in the fall with a rather thorough study of\r\nthe insects, partly because they are then so abundant, and partly\r\nbecause a knowledge of them is particularly useful to the grade\r\nteacher in the elementary schools.\r\n\r\nThe locust is studied in detail. Tumblers and aquaria are utilized as\r\nvivaria, so that there is abundant opportunity for the individual\r\nstudy of living specimens. Freshly killed material is used for\r\ndissection, so that students have no difficulty in making out the\r\ninternal anatomy, which is further elucidated with large, home-made\r\ncharts, each of which shows a single system, and serves for a text to\r\nteach them the functions of the various organs as worked out by modern\r\nphysiologists.\r\n\r\nThey then study, always with abundant material, the other insects\r\nbelonging to the same group. They are given two such insects, a bug,\r\nand two beetles, and required to classify them, giving reasons for so\r\ndoing. While this work is going on they have visited the beehive in\r\nsmall groups, sometimes seeing the queen and the drone, and always\r\nhaving the opportunity to see the workers pursuing their various\r\noccupations, and the eggs, larvæ, and pupæ in their different states\r\nof development. Beautiful models of the bees and of the comb, together\r\nwith dry and alcoholic material, illustrate further this\r\nmetamorphosis, by contrast making clearer the exactly opposite\r\nmetamorphosis of the locust.\r\n\r\nAt least one member of each of the other orders of insects is compared\r\nwith these two type forms, and, although only important points are\r\nconsidered at all, yet from one to two hours of laboratory work are\r\ndevoted to each specimen. This leisurely method of work is pursued to\r\ngive the students the opportunity, at least, to think for themselves.\r\nWhen the subject is finished they are then given a searching test.\r\nThis is never directly on their required reading, but planned to show\r\nto them and to their teachers whether they have really assimilated\r\nwhat they have seen and studied.\r\n\r\nAfter this the myriapods, the earthworm, and peripatus are studied,\r\nbecause of their resemblance to the probable ancestors of insects. In\r\nthe meantime they have had a dozen or more fully illustrated lectures\r\non evolution, so that at the close of this series of lessons they are\r\nexpected to have gained a knowledge of the methods of studying\r\ninsects, whether living or otherwise, a working hypothesis for the\r\ninterpretation of facts so obtained, and a knowledge of one order,\r\nwhich will serve admirably as a basis for comparison in much of their\r\nfuture work.\r\n\r\nThey then take up, more briefly, the relatives of the insects, the\r\nspiders and crustaceans, following these with the higher\r\ninvertebrates, reaching the fish in April. This, for obvious reasons,\r\nis their last dissection. But with living material, and the beautiful\r\npreparations and stuffed specimens with which the laboratory is\r\nfilled, they get a very general idea of the reptiles, birds, and\r\nmammals. This work is of necessity largely done by the students out of\r\nschool hours. For example, on a stand on one of the tables are placed\r\nthe various birds in season, with accompanying nests containing the\r\nproper quota of eggs. Books and pamphlets relating to the subject are\r\nplaced near. Each student is given a syllabus which will enable her to\r\nstudy these birds intelligently indoors and out, if she wishes to do\r\nso.\r\n\r\nIn the spring are taken up the orders of animals below the insect, and\r\nfor the last lesson a general survey of all the types studied gives\r\nthem the relationships of each to the other.\r\n\r\nTHE COURSE OF STUDY PURSUED IN THE SCHOOL OF PRACTICE.--In addition to\r\nthe plants and animals about them, the children study the weather,\r\nkeeping a daily record of their observations, and summarizing their\r\nresults at the end of the month. In connection with the weather and\r\nplants they study somewhat carefully the soil and, in this connection,\r\nthe common rocks and minerals of Philadelphia--gneiss, mica schist,\r\ngranite, sandstone, limestones, quartz, mica, and feldspar.\r\n\r\nAs in the laboratories, so here the effort is made to teach the\r\nchildren to reason, to read the story told by the individual plant, or\r\nanimal, or stone, or wind, or cloud. A special effort is made to teach\r\nthem to interpret everyday Nature as it lies around them. For this\r\nreason frequent short excursions into the city streets are made. Those\r\nwho smile and think that there is not much of Nature to be found in a\r\ncity street are those who have never looked for it. Enough material\r\nfor study has been gathered in these excursions to make them a feature\r\nof this work, even more than the longer ones which they take twice a\r\nyear into the country.\r\n\r\nLast year I made not less than eighty such short excursions, each time\r\nwith classes of about thirty-five. They were children of from seven to\r\nfourteen years of age. Without their hats, taking with them\r\nnote-books, pencils, and knives, they passed with me to the street.\r\nThe passers-by stopped to gaze at us, some with expressions of\r\namusement, others of astonishment; approval sometimes, quite\r\nfrequently the reverse. But I never once saw on the part of the\r\nchildren a consciousness of the mild sensation that they were\r\ncreating. They went for a definite purpose, which was always\r\naccomplished.\r\n\r\nThe children of the first and second years study nearly the same\r\nobjects. Those of the third and fourth years review this general work,\r\nstudying more thoroughly some one type. When they enter the fifth\r\nyear, they have considerable causal knowledge of the familiar plants\r\nand animals, of the stones, and of the weather. But, what is more\r\nprecious to them, they are sufficiently trained to be able to look at\r\nnew objects with a truly \"seeing eye.\"\r\n\r\nThe course of study now requires general ideas of physiology, and, in\r\nconsequences, the greater portion of their time for science is devoted\r\nto this subject. I am glad to be able to say, however, that it is not\r\n\"School Physiology\" which they study, but the guinea-pig and The\r\nWandering Jew!\r\n\r\nIn other words, I let them find out for themselves how and what the\r\nguinea-pig eats; how and what he expires and inspires; how and why he\r\nmoves. Along with this they study also plant respiration,\r\ntranspiration, assimilation, and reproduction, comparing these\r\nprocesses with those of animals, including themselves.\r\n\r\nThe children's interest is aroused and their observation stimulated by\r\nthe constant presence in the room with them of a mother guinea-pig and\r\nher child. Nevertheless, I have not hesitated to call in outside\r\nmaterials to help them to understand the work. A series of lessons on\r\nthe lime carbonates, therefore, preceded the lessons on respiration;\r\nan elephant's tooth, which I happened to have, helped to explain the\r\nguinea-pig's molars; and a microscope and a frog's leg made real to\r\nthem the circulation of the blood.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the time required for the physiology, the fifth-year\r\nchildren have about thirty lessons on minerals; the sixth-year, the\r\nsame number on plants; and the seventh-year, on animals; and it would\r\nbe difficult to decide which of these subjects rouses their greatest\r\nenthusiasm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRINCIPLES OF TAXATION.[6]\r\n\r\nBY THE LATE HON. DAVID A. WELLS.\r\n\r\n\r\nXX.--THE LAW OF THE DIFFUSION OF TAXES.\r\n\r\nPART I.\r\n\r\nNo attempt ought to be made to construct or formulate an economically\r\ncorrect, equitable, and efficient system of taxation which does not\r\ngive full consideration to the method or extent to which taxes diffuse\r\nthemselves after their first incidence. On this subject there is a\r\ngreat difference of opinion, which has occasioned, for more than a\r\ncentury, a vast and never-ending discussion on the part of economic\r\nwriters. All of this, however, has resulted in no generally accepted\r\npractical conclusions; has been truthfully characterized by a leading\r\nFrench economist (M. Parieu) as marked in no small part by the\r\n\"simplicity of ignorance,\" and from a somewhat complete review\r\n(recently published[7]) of the conflicting theories advanced by\r\nparticipants one rises with a feeling of weariness and disgust.\r\n\r\nThe majority of economists, legislators, and the public generally\r\nincline to the opinion that taxes mainly rest where they are laid, and\r\nare not shifted or diffused to an extent that requires any\r\nrecognition in the enactment of statutes for their assessment. Thus,\r\na tax commission of Massachusetts, as the result of their\r\ninvestigations, arrived at the conclusion that \"the tendency of taxes\r\nis that they must be paid by the actual persons on whom they are\r\nlevied.\" But a little thought must, however, make clear that unless\r\nthe advancement of taxes and their final and actual payment are one\r\nand the same thing, the Massachusetts statement is simply an evasion\r\nof the main question at issue, and that its authors had no intelligent\r\nconception of it. A better proposition, and one that may even be\r\nregarded as an economic axiom, is that, regarding taxation as a\r\nsynonym for a force, as it really is, it follows the natural and\r\ninvariable law of all forces, and distributes itself in the line of\r\nleast resistance. It is also valuable as indicating the line of\r\ninquiry most likely to lead to exact and practical conclusions. But\r\nbeyond this it lacks value, inasmuch as it fails to embody any\r\nsuggestions as to the best method of making the involved principle a\r\nbasis for any general system for correct taxation; inasmuch as \"the\r\nline of least resistance\" is not a positive factor, and may be and\r\noften is so arranged as to make levies on the part of the State under\r\nthe name of taxation subservient to private rather than public\r\ninterests. Under such circumstances the question naturally arises,\r\nWhat is the best method for determining, at least, the approximative\r\ntruth in respect to this vexed subject? A manifestly correct answer\r\nwould be: _first_, to avoid at the outset all theoretic assumptions as\r\na basis for reasoning; _second_, to obtain and marshal all the facts\r\nand conditions incident to the inquiry or deducible from experience;\r\n_third_, recognize the interdependence of all such facts and\r\nconclusions; _fourth_, be practical in the highest degree in accepting\r\nthings as they are, and dealing with them as they are found; and on\r\nsuch a basis attention is next asked to the following line of\r\ninvestigations.\r\n\r\nIt is essential at the outset to correct reasoning that the\r\ndistinction between _taxation_ and _spoliation_ be kept clearly in\r\nview. That only is entitled to be called a tax law which levies\r\nuniformly upon all the subjects of taxation; which does not of itself\r\nexempt any part of the property of _the same_ class which is selected\r\nto bear the primary burden of taxation, or by its imperfections to any\r\nextent permits such exemptions. All levies or assessments made by the\r\nState on the persons, property, or business of its citizens that do\r\nnot conform to such conditions are spoliations, concerning which\r\nnothing but irregularity can be predicated; nothing positive\r\nconcerning their diffusion can be asserted; and the most complete\r\ncollection of experiences in respect to them can not be properly\r\ndignified as \"a science.\" And it may be properly claimed that from a\r\nnonrecognition or lack of appreciation of the broad distinction\r\nbetween taxation and spoliation, the disagreement among economists\r\nrespecting the diffusion of taxes has mainly originated.\r\n\r\nWith this premise, let us next consider what facts and experiences are\r\npertinent to this subject, and available to assist in reaching sound\r\nconclusions; proceeding very carefully and cautiously in so doing,\r\ninasmuch as territory is to be entered upon that has not been\r\ngenerally or thoroughly explored.\r\n\r\nThe facts and experiences of first importance in such inquiry are that\r\nthe examination of the tax rolls in any State, city, or municipality\r\nof the United States will show that surprisingly small numbers of\r\npersons primarily pay or advance any kind of taxes. It is not probable\r\nthat more than one tenth of the adult population or about one\r\ntwentieth of the entire population of the United States ever come in\r\ncontact officially with a tax assessor or tax collector. It is also\r\nestimated that less than two per cent of the total population of the\r\nUnited States advance the entire customs and internal revenue of the\r\nFederal Government.\r\n\r\nIn the investigations made in 1871, by a commission created by the\r\nLegislature of the State of New York to revise its laws relative to\r\nthe assessment and collection of taxes, it was found that in the city\r\nof New York, out of a population of over one million in the above\r\nyear, only 8,920 names, or less than one per cent of this great\r\nmultitude of people, had \"any household furniture, money, goods,\r\nchattels, debts due from solvent debtors, whether on account of\r\ncontract, note, bond, or mortgage, or any public stocks, or stocks in\r\nmoneyed corporations, or in general any personal property of which the\r\nassessors could take cognizance for taxation\"; and further, that not\r\nover _four_ per cent, or, say, forty thousand persons out of the\r\nmillion, were subject to any primary tax in respect to the ownership\r\nof any property whatever, real or personal; while only a few years\r\nsubsequent, or in 1875, the regular tax commissioners of New York\r\nestimated that of the property defined and described by the laws of\r\nthe State as personal property, an amount approximating two thousand\r\nmillion dollars in value was held in New York city alone. Later\r\ninvestigations show that this state of things has continued. Thus, in\r\n1895, out of a population of about two million, it was estimated that\r\nonly seventy-nine thousand, or not over four per cent of the\r\ninhabitants of the city, were subject to primary taxation, and that\r\none half the whole amount collected in that year was paid by less than\r\na thousand persons. In the city of Boston, where the tax laws are\r\nexecuted in the most arbitrary manner, the ratio of population\r\ndirectly assessed is somewhat greater, but aside from the poll tax,\r\nwhich is a per capita and not a property tax, only 7.27 per cent of\r\nresidents paid a property tax in 1895 out of a population of 494,205.\r\nIn one of the smaller cities of Massachusetts, where persons and\r\nproperty are capable of more thorough supervision than larger numbers\r\nand areas--namely, the city of Springfield, with a population of about\r\nfifty thousand--the report of its tax officials shows that for the\r\nyear 1894-'95 the number of persons and corporations assessed on\r\nproperty (mainly real estate) was 7,745, or one for every 6.4 of its\r\ncitizens, while 10,560 other citizens were assessed for a poll tax of\r\ntwo dollars only. Of the total amount of taxes assessed--namely,\r\n$735,948--the above number, 10,560, paid only $21,120; and this is the\r\nexperience generally throughout the United States, as it will be in\r\nevery country under a free popular government, where arbitrary\r\ninquisitions and arrests of persons and seizures of property are not\r\nallowed, and where a soldier does not practically stand behind every\r\ntax assessor and collector.\r\n\r\nThe time (1871) when the personal investigations above referred to\r\nwere made was when the masses of the city of New York were moved with\r\nindignation at the misuse and private appropriation by a few officials\r\n(Tweed and his associates) of the municipal revenues raised by\r\ntaxation, under cover of instituting public improvements, and which\r\nfinally led to their prosecution, imprisonment, or self-imposed exile;\r\nand the questions which naturally suggested themselves were: If only\r\nsome forty thousand of the million in New York city paid the taxes,\r\nwhat interest had the other nine hundred and sixty thousand who never\r\nsaw the face of a tax assessor or collector in opposing corruption?\r\nWhat, in an honest administration of the city government and in a\r\nreduction of taxes? Must it not be for the interest of the many that\r\nthe expenditures of the State shall always be as large as possible?\r\nMust they not be benefited by exorbitant taxes on the owners of\r\nproperty, and a distribution of the money collected, even if stolen by\r\ncorruptionists, but spent by them lavishly on enterprises that will\r\nfurnish new opportunities for employment or amusement for the masses?\r\nClearly, so far as any personal experience growing out of any _direct_\r\nassessment and levy was concerned, ninety-six per cent of the\r\npopulation of the city had no more cause of personal grievance by\r\nreason of the unlawful taking of money from the city treasury than\r\nthey would have had at the taking of an equivalent amount from the\r\nmunicipal treasuries of London, Paris, or any other city.\r\n\r\nThe answer to these questions is to be found in the fact, as John\r\nAdams once remarked, that \"if the Creator had given man a reason that\r\nis fallible, he has also impressed upon him an instinct that is sure.\"\r\nAnd this instinct teaches the masses everywhere, though they have\r\nnever read a book on political economy, or heard any one discourse\r\nlearnedly on the principles of taxation, that if taxes are increased,\r\neither by a lawful or unlawful expenditure of public money, they can\r\nnot in any possible way avoid paying some portion of its increase; or,\r\nin other words, that increased taxes meant increased cost of living,\r\nthrough increased rents, increased price of fuel, clothing, and\r\nprovisions, and possibly diminished opportunity to labor through such\r\nincreased cost of the products of labor as would limit and restrict\r\nmarkets or consumption. In short, that taxes inevitably fall upon them\r\nthrough the increased price of all they consume, even if they pay\r\nnothing to the tax collector directly. A large proportion of the\r\nmasses of the city of New York in 1871-'72, who paid no taxes\r\ndirectly, accordingly and spontaneously joined hands with the\r\ncomparatively few of their fellow-citizens who did pay in resisting\r\nextravagance and corruption.[8]\r\n\r\nWe are thus led up and forced to the recognition of two propositions,\r\nor rather principles, in respect to taxation that can not be\r\ninvalidated. The _first_ is, that it is not necessary that a tax\r\nassessor or collector should personally assess and levy upon every\r\ncitizen of a State or community in order that all should be compelled\r\nto contribute of his property for the support of such State or\r\ncommunity; _second_, that there is an inexorable law by which every\r\nman must bear a portion of the burden of public expenditures, even\r\nthough the official assessors take no direct cognizance of him\r\nwhatever.\r\n\r\nThe following incident may here be cited as instructive: In one of the\r\nrecent official hearings before a legislative committee of one of the\r\nStates, a strenuous advocate of the popular doctrine that there was\r\nand could be no such thing as equality in taxation except by rigidly\r\ntaxing everybody directly for all his property, of every description,\r\nboth real and personal, and that to not tax immediately and directly\r\nwas, in at least a great degree, to exempt from taxation, expressed\r\nhimself as entirely opposed to any system of restricting assessments\r\nto a comparatively few things, on the ground that it would be a\r\nrecognition in the United States of a system which in Great Britain\r\nhad ground down the masses into poverty. He, however, obtained some\r\nnew light on the subject of nondiffusion by being reminded that if the\r\nmasses of England had been grievously oppressed by taxation, it had\r\nbeen under a system of many years' standing, which never in any way\r\nbrings the tax collector in direct contact with nineteen twentieths of\r\nthe entire population; the customs taxes of Great Britain being\r\npractically levied on only four articles--spirits, tea, coffee, and\r\ntobacco; and the inland revenue also on practically four--spirits,\r\nbeer, legacies and successions, and stamps (on deeds, insurance\r\npolicies, bills of exchange, receipts, drafts, etc.). Generalizing,\r\nthen, on the basis of so broad a fact, how illogical and unscientific\r\nwas the assumption that whatever persons, property, or business are\r\nnot taxed directly are exempt from taxation!--and yet the practical\r\nexemplification of such a system, in the case of England, was a most\r\nefficient instrumentality for grinding the masses of her people down\r\nto poverty.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, to generalize from the experience of an individual\r\nor a class in place of that of a nation or community, let us take the\r\ncase of a person who passes all the year _in transitu_--moving\r\nbackward and forward, for example, in a boat on the line of the Erie\r\nCanal, or between the head waters of the Mississippi and its mouth; a\r\ncitizen of no one State, a resident in no one town, and buying all\r\nthat he eats, drinks, and wears wherever he can buy cheapest. Does\r\nthis man escape taxation because he has no permanent _situs_\r\n(residence as a citizen), and is unknown by any assessor? If he does,\r\nthen his occupation is more profitable to the extent of the taxes he\r\navoids than is that of the individual who, following analogous\r\noccupations, resides permanently in one location, and pays taxes\r\nregularly; or else some notable, easily discernible cause, as undue\r\ncompetition to obtain situations, will account for his exemption.\r\n\r\nLet us next consider how practical experience definitely indicates the\r\nline of least resistance, in conformity with which those contributions\r\nof property or service which the State requires its citizens to make\r\nfor its support, and are worthy of designation as taxes, diffuse\r\nthemselves. Let us take first that form of indirect taxation which is\r\nknown as customs, or taxes on imports, one from which the Federal\r\nGovernment of the United States has derived in recent years more than\r\nhalf of its revenue, and Great Britain more than one fourth of its\r\ntotal receipts from all forms of imperial taxes. That all such taxes\r\nas a rule diffuse themselves, and ultimately fall upon and are paid by\r\nfinal consumers, is capable of demonstration by a great variety of\r\nevidence. Every remission of customs duties on the imports into any\r\ncountry of its staple articles of consumption is followed by a\r\nreduction of cost approximately equal to such reduction, and a\r\nconsequent increase in consumption. On the other hand, nothing is\r\nbetter settled than that an increase in customs taxes on imported\r\narticles as a rule increases prices and tends to reduce consumption.\r\nWhen Great Britain, in 1863, reduced her taxes (duties) on her imports\r\nof tea from 1_s._ 5_d._ to 1_s._ per pound, her importation of tea\r\nincreased from 114,000,000 pounds in 1862 to 139,000,000 in 1866, and\r\nher per capita consumption during the same period from 2.70 pounds to\r\n3.42 pounds; and again, when the duty was further reduced in 1865 from\r\n1_s._ to 6_d._ per pound, the annual importations increased from\r\n139,000,000 in 1866 to 209,000,000 in 1881, and the per capita\r\nconsumption from 3.42 pounds to 4.58.\r\n\r\nWhen by the act of October, 1890, the tax was removed from the imports\r\nof crude sugars into the United States, the price of the same went\r\ndown almost immediately to an equal extent in all American markets;\r\nwhile the consumption of sugar in the country increased from an\r\naverage of about fifty-four pounds per capita in 1890 to more than\r\nsixty-seven pounds in 1892. A like result has attended a similar\r\nexperience in respect to this in other countries, and especially in\r\nGreat Britain. Thus, the aggregate consumption of sugar by the British\r\npeople in 1844 was returned at 237,143 tons. A reduction of taxes on\r\nits importation in 1864 increased its domestic use to 528,919 tons; a\r\nreduction of fifty per cent on existing rates in 1870 made it 695,029\r\ntons; another reduction of fifty per cent in 1873 carried up\r\nconsumption to 779,000 tons; and when, in 1874, all taxes on the\r\nimports of sugar were abolished, the annual domestic consumption\r\nincreased in little more than a year's period to 930,000 tons. On the\r\nother hand, when by the tariff act of 1890 an additional tax of half a\r\ncent per pound was imposed on the import of tin plate into the United\r\nStates, tin plate went up to an equal extent in price all over the\r\ncountry; and so also on pearl buttons, linen goods, and other articles\r\nof foreign production on the importations of which the tariff taxes\r\nwere largely increased. By the tariff act of 1890, also, eggs, which\r\ncould formerly be imported into the United States free of duty, were\r\nmade subject to a tax of five cents per dozen. Since then the price of\r\neggs imported from Canada into districts of the United States within\r\nthe same sphere of territorial competition has been increased to the\r\nAmerican consumers to almost exactly the extent of the import tax to\r\nwhich they are subjected. Thus, when the price of eggs was ten and a\r\nhalf cents per dozen in Toronto, they were sixteen cents in Buffalo\r\nand sixteen and a half to seventeen cents in New York. Such a result\r\nwould be unaccountable if the Canadian farmers paid the duty on eggs\r\nsent by them to the United States.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to here ask attention to the opinions entertained\r\nand expressed by those whose situation and experience have qualified\r\nthem to speak with authority: \"The duty constitutes the price of the\r\nwhole mass of the article in the market. It is substantially paid on\r\nthe article of domestic manufacture, as well as that of foreign\r\nproduction\" (John Quincy Adams). \"I said it, and I stand by it, that\r\nas a general rule the duties paid on imports operate as a tax upon the\r\nconsumer\" (John Sherman). Mr. Blaine, in his Twenty Years in\r\nCongress, says, speaking of the increase of duties on imports by the\r\ntariff act of July 14, 1862, that it \"shut out still more conclusively\r\nall competition from foreign fabrics. The increased cost was charged\r\nto the consumer.\" Mr. McKinley, in 1890, in a report introducing a\r\nbill for revision of the tariff of the United States, in the direction\r\nof increased rates of duties on imports, said it was not the intent of\r\nthe bill \"to further cut down prices,\" that the people were \"already\r\nsuffering from low prices,\" and would not be satisfied \"with\r\nlegislation which will result in lower prices.\" In an elaborate\r\nopinion given by the New York Court of Appeals in 1851 (see vol. iv,\r\nNew York Reports), in which there was no suspicion of any issue of\r\nfree trade or protection, the courts, in carefully considering the\r\nrelative powers of the legislature and the judiciary in respect to\r\ntaxation, assumed the proposition that \"_all duties on imported goods\r\nare taxes on the class of consumers_\" to be in the nature of a\r\nself-evident truth or economic axiom.\r\n\r\nHenry Clay, in a celebrated speech in the United States House of\r\nRepresentatives in 1833, in advocacy of a protective tariff policy,\r\ncandidly admitted that \"in general it may be taken as a rule that the\r\nduty upon an article forms a portion of its price.\" But he\r\nsubsequently qualified such admission by claiming that it does not\r\nfollow that any consequent enhancement of its price is a tax on\r\nconsumers, inasmuch as \"directly or indirectly, in one form or\r\nanother, all consumers of protected articles, enhanced in price,\" will\r\nget an equivalent. But this may be equally affirmed of all necessary\r\nand equitable taxation, and does not in any way antagonize the theory\r\nthat the final incidence of the class of taxes under consideration\r\nfalls on consumption.\r\n\r\nBut, notwithstanding these conclusions and the incontrovertible\r\nevidence by which they are supported, not a few persons occupying\r\nplaces of great legislative influence, and no small part of the\r\ngeneral public, hold to the view that taxes on imports are really in\r\nthe nature of premiums paid by foreigners for the privilege of selling\r\ntheir goods in the markets of the importing country, and do not fall\r\non its people who consume them. That means that if the foreigner has a\r\nyard of cloth, or other commodity, which he sells at home for one\r\ndollar, and the United States imposes a tariff of fifty cents on it,\r\nhe will then sell it for export to America at fifty cents. There is no\r\ninstance mentioned in history where this has ever been done, but\r\nhistory unfortunately is rarely taken into account by the public in\r\nthe discussion of these questions. In this connection the following\r\nhistorical incident is interesting and instructive: In 1782 an attempt\r\nby the Congress of the Confederation of the several American States to\r\nprovide a system of revenue to defray the general expenses of the\r\nConfederation by duties on imports, which then was not permissible,\r\nwas blocked by the refusal of the State of Rhode Island to concur in\r\nit, the Legislature of that State unanimously rejecting the measure\r\nfor three reasons--one of which was that it would bear hardest on the\r\nfew commercial States, particularly Rhode Island, which in virtue of\r\ntheir relations with foreign commerce monopolize imports, and lightest\r\non the agricultural States, that directly imported little or nothing.\r\nCongress appointed Alexander Hamilton to draft a reply to Rhode\r\nIsland, and in his answer he relied mainly on what he regarded as an\r\nincontrovertible fact, that duties on imports would not prove a charge\r\non an importing State, but on the final consumers of imports, wherever\r\nthey may be located.\r\n\r\nIf the theory and assumption so confidently and generally asserted are\r\nto be accepted as correct, that the foreigner pays the protective\r\ntaxes which a country levies on its imports, and that they do not fall\r\nupon or are not paid by its people who consume them, then it must\r\nfollow that to the extent that a country taxes its imports it lives at\r\nthe expense of foreign nations; and that, as Great Britain is the\r\ncountry with which the United States has the largest foreign trade, it\r\nmust pay the largest share of the customs taxes of the United States,\r\nor a good share of its annual revenue from all sources. Attention is\r\nfurther asked to the exact practical application of this theory. Thus,\r\nthe United States in 1895 imported $36,438,196 worth of woolen\r\nmanufactures, on which it assessed and collected duties (taxes) to the\r\namount of $20,698,264, or 56.80 per cent of the value of such imports.\r\nCertainly this was a pretty heavy tax on foreign nations in respect to\r\nthe sales of only one class of these commodities; but it represented\r\nbut a tithe of what the tariff taxes of the United States, if paid by\r\nforeigners, cost them. Thus they had to sell their woolens to the\r\npeople of the latter country at less than half their value in order to\r\ncompensate for the 56.8 per cent tax. But a nation engaged in foreign\r\ntrade can not as a rule have two prices for the product of its\r\nindustries; or one price for what it sells at home and another and\r\ndifferent price for what it sells to foreigners. So the fifty-six per\r\ncent deducted from the cost of the woolens sold by foreigners to the\r\nUnited States necessarily had to be deducted not only from so much of\r\ntheir product consumed at home, but also from what they sent for sale\r\nto all foreign countries. A further practical application of this\r\ntheory is worthy of consideration. As Great Britain imposes no\r\nprotective duties or taxes on its imports, it evidently can not\r\ncollect anything from other nations by the system of taxation under\r\nconsideration. On the other hand, the aggregate value of its exports\r\nsent to foreign nations during the year 1892 was $1,135,000,000, and\r\nif these several nations taxed this value at the average rate which\r\nthe United States imposed in 1894 on all its dutiable imports--namely,\r\nfifty per cent--Great Britain obviously had to pay some $557,000,000\r\nin that year for the support of foreign governments; and while this\r\nhas been the experience of Great Britain for more than forty years of\r\nthis century, she has as a nation been increasing in wealth during\r\nthis whole period.\r\n\r\nSome of the recent official experiences of the Government of the\r\nUnited States that are pertinent to the topic under consideration are\r\nsufficiently curious to make them worthy of an economic record. In a\r\nspeech introducing a bill into the United States House of\r\nRepresentatives, which subsequently resulted in the tariff act of\r\n1890, the then chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means laid down\r\nthe following proposition: \"The Government ought not to buy abroad\r\nwhat it can buy at home. Nor should it be exempted from the laws it\r\nimposes upon its citizens.\"\r\n\r\nThis would seem to warrant the characterization of a discovery that\r\nthe United States had some reliable and important source of revenue\r\nindependent of taxation,[9] and that, by compelling the application of\r\na part of this income to the payment of taxes to itself, the\r\nGovernment is placed upon an equality with the citizens. A legitimate\r\ncriticism on this proposition is that the idea that all the income of\r\nthe Treasury is derived from the people, and that to transfer portions\r\nof this income from one official recipient to another can have hardly\r\nany other result than an additional cost of bookkeeping, seems never\r\nto have entered the mind of the speaker.\r\n\r\nAgain, the United States tariff act of 1883 contained in its free list\r\na provision for the admittance of \"articles imported for the use of\r\nthe United States, provided that the price of the same did not include\r\nthe duty\" imposed on such importations. Under the tariff act of 1890\r\nthis provision was stricken out of the statute, with the result that\r\nwhen the Government imported any articles for its own use which were\r\nsubject to duties (as, for example, materials to be used in the\r\nNational Bureau of Printing and Engraving), it was obliged, in virtue\r\nof its nonexemption from the laws which it imposed on its own\r\ncitizens, to pay such duties itself. But as the Government has no\r\nauthority to expend money for any purpose without the authority of\r\nCongress, the latter body accordingly authorized the Federal Treasury\r\nto appropriate money from its tax receipts and make payments with the\r\nsame to the customhouse, which the customhouse was to immediately pay\r\nback into the Treasury. Just what process was gone through with to\r\neffect such a result the public was not informed, but probably the\r\ncollector of customs drew his warrant on the Treasury, had the amount\r\ncredited to his account, and then recredited to the Treasury. But, be\r\nthis as it may, it is clear that the Government, under the conditions\r\nabove stated, paid the tax on its imports; that the tax may be\r\nregarded in the light of a penalty on the Government for importing\r\narticles for its own use; and that the action of Congress in\r\nauthorizing the Treasury to appropriate money for the payment of such\r\ntaxes was a recognition or admission by that body that a tax upon\r\nimports neither puts anything _in_ nor takes anything _from_ the\r\npocket of the foreigner. Does it not, moreover, invest with a degree\r\nof comicality a law enacted by the Congress of the United States for\r\nthe purpose of taxing foreign importers, which necessitated the\r\nenactment by it of another law appropriating money to enable the\r\nUnited States to pay customs taxes every time on everything that it\r\nmay import for its own use?[10] Finally, if the foreigner and not our\r\ncitizens pays our customs taxes on imports, what is the object of\r\nplacing by specific statutes any article on the free list? Why not let\r\nhim continue to pay millions of taxes for us, as, for example, on\r\nsugar?\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[6] It is fortunate that Mr. Wells had practically completed his\r\nessays on taxation before death put an end to his activity. The\r\nmanuscript of two chapters was found among his papers--one on the Best\r\nMethods of Taxation, and the other on the Law of the Diffusion of\r\nTaxes, begun in this number. The first manuscript has some pages\r\nmissing, and it has been thought best to postpone its publication, in\r\nthe hope that the missing pages may be found. It is evident that the\r\nlast touches were yet to be put upon the chapter on the diffusion of\r\ntaxes--a chapter that was to sum up the theory of taxation developed\r\nby the writer. So much of that summary is contained in it as to make\r\nthe meaning of Mr. Wells unmistakable, and its publication is further\r\namply justified by the number of practical illustrations and happy\r\napplication of theory to fact, in the selection and explanation of\r\nwhich the author excelled. The entire series, which has been running\r\nin the Popular Science Monthly for more than three years, will now be\r\ncollected in a volume--a worthy memorial to one whose powers of\r\npopular exposition of abstract problems placed him among the first of\r\neconomists in the United States.\r\n\r\n[7] On the Shifting and Incidence of Taxation, by Prof. Edwin R.\r\nSeligman, 1892.\r\n\r\n[8] The assertion would not be warranted that the masses of New York\r\nwere wholly unanimous in condemning Tweed, for a portion of them were\r\nundoubtedly well content with the situation. He had curried favor with\r\nthe very poor and ignorant by distributing coal and flour, and making\r\nostentatious presents of money; and these \"charities\" are remembered\r\nto this day in the poorer parts of New York city, and Tweed is\r\nesteemed by many as the victim of injustice, and a man who suffered\r\nbecause he was the friend of the people.\r\n\r\n[9] Of the net ordinary receipts of the Federal Government\r\n($385,819,000) in 1893, only about $12,000,000 was derived from\r\nsources that could not be regarded as taxes, and were mainly receipts\r\nfrom the sales and surveys of public and Indian lands ($4,120,000) and\r\nof other Government property.\r\n\r\n[10] In 1897 the merchant tailors of the United States, who ought to\r\nknow something about the incidence of a custom tax on imported\r\nclothing, united in a petition to Congress asking that Americans\r\nreturning from Europe be permitted to introduce only two suits of\r\nforeign-made clothes free of duty; and in support of their request\r\nthey comment as follows on a ruling of the Treasury in respect to this\r\nmatter: \"Under this ruling it was possible to enter free of duty vast\r\nquantities of foreign-made garments which had never been actually in\r\nuse, and which were so imported solely because there exists a relative\r\ndifference of at least fifty per cent in values between the cost of\r\nmade-up garments in the United States and Europe, thus saving to the\r\npurchaser of garments abroad one half of their actual value upon\r\narrival within the United States duty free.\" But if the foreigner who\r\nmade and sold the goods in question was liable to pay the duty on\r\ndutiable clothing, and attended to his duty, there would be no profit\r\nto the returning tourist in importing clothing free of duty. It is\r\nfurther evident also that American tailors agree in opinion with\r\nAlexander Hamilton that the consumers of imported articles pay the\r\ncustoms taxes.\r\n\r\nThe records of the commercial relations between the United States and\r\nCanada are exceedingly instructive on this matter. They all show that\r\nfor the products which the Canadian sends to the United States, and on\r\nwhich somebody pays the duty, he receives exactly the same price as\r\nfor those products which he sends to England, on which nobody pays any\r\nduty. This experience is exactly the same as that of the farmers of\r\nthe Northwestern States of the Federal Union, who usually get the same\r\nprice for their wheat furnished to a Minnesota flour mill, or for\r\nshipment to free-trade England, as to countries like France and\r\nGermany, where heavy duties are assessed upon its import. The term\r\n\"usually\" is employed, for producers in the United States and Canada\r\nalike do not always get as large a price for the articles they export\r\nas for the same articles they sell to their fellow-countrymen. Again,\r\nif it be true, as the advocates of extreme protection assert, that the\r\nforeign exporter and not the consumer pays the duties on goods sent by\r\nhim for sale in this country, how does it happen that it is not true\r\nconcerning the farm produce and live stock exported from Canada? And\r\nwhy should American farmers be exempt from this rule in sending their\r\ngrain to Europe? Has anybody ever known of England buying American\r\nproducts any cheaper in New York than France or Germany, and is it not\r\nalso true that the French or German or Italian consumer usually pays\r\nat least the amount of the duty levied by his Government more for\r\nAmerican products than his English competitor has, whose imports are\r\nsubjected to no duty? During the period from 1854 to 1866 there was,\r\nunder the reciprocity treaty, practically free trade between Canada\r\nand the United States in live stock, wool, barley, rye, peas, oats,\r\nand other farm products, while subsequent to 1866, when the\r\nreciprocity treaty had been repealed, duties were imposed on all these\r\narticles on their import from Canada into the United States. During\r\nthe first period Canadian horses, for example, sold under free trade\r\nfor shipment to the United States at from sixty-five to eighty-five\r\ndollars each, while during the years next subsequent to 1866 the value\r\nof the Canadian horses imported into the United States was returned at\r\nfrom ninety-two to one hundred and four dollars each; thus showing\r\nthat the United States tariff did not force the Canadian horse\r\nbreeders to lower their prices in order to compensate American\r\npurchasers for the duties exacted. And as regards the other products\r\nmentioned, the official data show that in no case did the imposition\r\nof duties under the United States tariff reduce the prices paid by\r\nAmerican purchasers to the Canadian farmers for their products. These\r\nare very commonplace, very familiar, and very convincing facts which\r\nought to silence all this talk about the foreign exporter or anybody\r\nelse but the consumer paying the duty; but it is not at all probable\r\nthat they will.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR FLORIDA ALLIGATOR.\r\n\r\nBY I. W. BLAKE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn alligator is not an attractive creature. He has not a single virtue\r\nthat can be named. He is cowardly, treacherous, hideous. He is neither\r\ngraceful nor even respectable in appearance. He is not even amusing or\r\ngrotesque in his ungainliness, for as a brute--a brute unqualified--he\r\nis always so intensely real, that one shrinks from him with loathing;\r\nand a laugh at his expense while in his presence would seem curiously\r\nout of place.\r\n\r\nHis personality, too, is strong. Once catch the steadfast gaze of a\r\nfree, adult alligator's wicked eyes, with their odd vertical pupils\r\nfixed full upon your own, and the significance of the expression \"evil\r\neye,\" and the mysteries of snake-charming, hypnotism, and hoodooism\r\nwill be readily understood, for his brutish, merciless, unflinching\r\nstare is simply blood-chilling.\r\n\r\nZoölogically the alligator belongs to the genus _Crocodilus_, and he\r\nhas all the hideousness of that family, lacking somewhat its\r\nbloodthirstiness, although the American alligator is carnivorous by\r\nnature, and occasionally cannibalistic. Strictly speaking, however,\r\nthe true alligator is much less dangerous than his relatives of the\r\nOld World, and he is correspondingly less courageous.\r\n\r\nOne would suppose the saurians, or crocodilians, from their general\r\nappearance to be huge lizards, but the resemblance is superficial. The\r\nwhole internal structure differs widely, and, subdivided into\r\ngavials, crocodiles, and alligators, they form a family by themselves\r\nwhich is widespread, extending into considerable areas of the\r\ntemperate regions.\r\n\r\nAll crocodilians are great, ungainly reptiles, having broad, depressed\r\nbodies, short legs, and long, powerful, and wonderfully flexible tails\r\nwhich are compressed--that is, flattened sideways. Upon the upper\r\nsurface of the tail lie two jagged or saw-toothed crests, which unite\r\nnear the middle of the appendage, continuing in a single row to the\r\nextremity.\r\n\r\nAll have thick necks and bodies protected by regular transverse rows\r\nof long, horny plates or shields, which are elevated in the center\r\ninto keel-shaped ridges, forming an armor that is quite bullet-proof.\r\nThe throat, the under side of the neck, and belly are not thus\r\nprotected, and it is at these places, as well as at the eyes, and also\r\njust behind the ears, that the hunter directs his aim.\r\n\r\nThe principal points of difference between a gavial and a crocodile\r\nare these: the former has very long, slender jaws, set with\r\ntwenty-seven teeth in each side of the upper jaw and with twenty-five\r\nteeth in the under, while at the extremity of the snout there are two\r\nholes, through which pass upward the lower large front teeth, but all\r\nthe remaining teeth are free, and slant well outward; whereas a\r\ncrocodile has a head that is triangular, the snout being the apex; a\r\nnarrow muzzle, and canine teeth in the lower jaw, which pass freely\r\nupward in the notches in the side of the upper jaw.\r\n\r\nAn alligator has a broad, flat muzzle, and the canine teeth of the\r\nlower jaw fit into sockets in the under surface of the upper jaw. It\r\nis strictly an American form of the family. Its feet being much less\r\nwebbed, its habits are also less perfectly aquatic, and, preferring\r\nstill or stagnant fresh-water courses or swamps, it is rarely found in\r\ntide-water streams.\r\n\r\nThe crocodile, on the contrary, is commonly found in swift-running,\r\nfresh and salt water rivers. He is a sagacious brute, and ferocious,\r\noften attacking human beings without provocation; but the alligator,\r\nas a rule, is not disposed to fight, although in South America, where\r\nit goes by the name of _caiman_ or _cayman_, it grows to an enormous\r\nsize, and is said to be fully as dangerous as the crocodile. There is\r\nalso a variety of the family--that is, a true crocodile--found in\r\nFlorida, but it is very rare, and smaller than its Asiatic relative.\r\n\r\nThe mouths of all these reptiles, which are large and extend beyond\r\nthe ears, present a formidable array of sharp, conical teeth of\r\ndifferent sizes, set far apart in the crocodile and the alligator,\r\nsome being enlarged into tusks. All are implanted in separate sockets,\r\nand form a single row upon each jaw. When a tooth is shed or broken,\r\na new one promptly comes up beneath the hollow base of the old one;\r\nand in this way, all ready for the need, sometimes three or four\r\nwaiting teeth, packed together like a nest of thimbles, may be seen in\r\nthe jaw of a dead alligator.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: YOUNG PET ALLIGATOR. From photograph by E. L. Russell,\r\nPalm Beach.]\r\n\r\nThe alligator is at best an awkward brute. Slow and ungainly upon\r\nland--although even there his powerful tail can, when necessary,\r\nassist the scuffling paws to an astonishing extent if the creature is\r\nin haste--he shows to better advantage in the water. There he turns\r\nhis clumsy body with wonderful dexterity and swiftness, when, at the\r\nsight of a swimming muskrat or a wading dog, he instantly changes from\r\nwhat has resembled a drifting log idly floating upon the calm surface\r\nof the swamp, into a thing of life--fierce and horrible.\r\n\r\nThe general food of an alligator is fish, turtles, and frogs, with an\r\noccasional heedless dog or fowl. A number of adult alligators will\r\nquickly deplenish a small, clear-water lake of its finny inhabitants,\r\nwhich statement to would-be Florida fishermen will readily account for\r\nthe lack in many localities. There is also a curious belief in the\r\nSouth that the creature has an especial liking for a \"darkey steak,\"\r\nand for this reason he is feared by the negroes. That he becomes\r\ncarnivorous to a dangerous extent when pressed by hunger, there is no\r\ndoubt, for, the supply of fish exhausted, he must look for larger\r\ngame.\r\n\r\nPartially concealed by rubbish, or floating idly close to the\r\nbank--always only a short distance from his retreat--he so closely\r\nresembles an old and weather-worn log that no suspicion is aroused.\r\nPresently a razorback comes down the narrow trail that meanders\r\nthrough the scrub and passes close to the reptile. Let it pass between\r\nthe alligator and the water--that is, between the creature and his\r\n_cave_--and the end has come. An alligator seldom misses, and one\r\nspring, leap, or plunge, or whatever the swift, clumsy movement may be\r\ncalled, and the wretched animal is seized and held fast, either by the\r\nnose or leg, as a rule. Then the struggle begins, for the razorback\r\nloves its life, despised pig of the Florida flatwoods though it is.\r\n\r\nAlligators drown their prey. Their own nostrils and throats are so\r\narranged that they themselves can sink to the bottom without danger of\r\nsuffocation, although their mouths, or rather their jaws, may be\r\nwidely stretched with the body of their victim. Indeed, they can\r\nreascend to the surface to breathe without releasing the prize; and,\r\nas this power is so closely connected with their method of killing the\r\nlarger animals, a description of the latter, repulsive though it is,\r\nmay not be out of place.\r\n\r\nThe teeth of an alligator are better adapted for crushing and\r\ncrunching than for biting. Therefore, for him to eat a struggling\r\nanimal would be difficult. Instinct teaches him that it must first be\r\nkilled.\r\n\r\nTo dispose of a dog or a chicken is a small matter, for when the\r\nalligator meets it upon the bank one strong, far-reaching sweep of the\r\npowerful tail tosses it far out upon the lake. The alligator simply\r\nfollows, grasps the half-stunned creature in his jaws, and disappears\r\nbeneath the surface, where he remains until all is quiet. With a\r\nlarger animal, however, he proceeds differently, for the reason that a\r\nyearling, a colt, or a razorback is not so easily handled. First,\r\ntherefore, a description of an alligator's cave must be given, since\r\nit is to this grewsome retreat that the hideous brute takes his booty.\r\n\r\nSelecting some spot where the water is deep--usually beneath some\r\noverhanging bank--an alligator excavates what is called a \"cave.\" Any\r\none, standing upon the border of a lake or swamp in Florida, may, all\r\nunconsciously, be directly over one of these places. He makes it\r\nsufficiently large to accommodate one or more of his kind, by dragging\r\nout the mud and roots with the strong claws or nails that arm his fore\r\npaws or legs. These \"caves\" serve in winter for hibernation, and at\r\nother times for the purpose that will be explained.\r\n\r\nOnce in the water, then--to return to the unhappy razorback--the\r\nalligator does not rely wholly upon his teeth and jaws to hold the\r\ndesperate animal. He can not yet sink, for the victim is too strong.\r\nIt must first be drowned, and a furious struggle for the mastery then\r\nbegins.\r\n\r\nBy degrees the brute finally succeeds in dragging the animal out into\r\nwater sufficiently deep to suit his purpose, and then he clasps it\r\nfirmly with his paws, precisely like the hugging of a bear. He then\r\nbegins to roll over and over. Now beneath the surface, now out, he\r\nturns and turns, first the alligator uppermost, then his prey,\r\nalternately, until the poor animal is drowned literally by inches.\r\nBefore long the razorback weakens, his struggles lessen, and then the\r\nalligator sinks to the bottom, and when all motion has ceased he\r\ndeposits the body in his cave, well pleased with the prospect of a\r\nfull larder for some time to come.\r\n\r\nOne might naturally ask just here whether or not this scene would be\r\nthe same were a human being the victim. The reply would be--precisely.\r\n\r\nThe alligator undoubtedly prefers his food in a partly decomposed\r\ncondition, although it is an undecided point whether this preference\r\narises from a natural taste, or for the reason that food in that state\r\nis softer and more easily torn apart. Whichever may be the case,\r\nNature unasked supplies the remedy, and the alligator takes advantage\r\nof her assistance, and deposits his victim in his hiding place,\r\nconfident that at the proper time it will rise to the surface in the\r\ncondition best adapted to his needs.\r\n\r\nAlthough by nature the alligator is amphibious, he passes the greater\r\npart of his time upon land during the breeding season. At such times,\r\nalso, he migrates from one clear-water lake or swamp to another,\r\nshould he not find a mate in his own locality, and he may not\r\ninfrequently be met in his overland journeyings. Alligators are not\r\nstrictly gregarious, although large numbers are found in the same body\r\nof water; while, on the contrary, there will often be but one or two\r\nthat will haunt a certain tract for a long period.\r\n\r\nDuring this season the bull alligator is very noisy, and his deep\r\nbellowing may be heard for a long distance. To state that this noise\r\ncauses the ground to vibrate may seem an exaggeration, but the fact\r\nmay easily be proved by visiting a swamp where the reptiles have\r\ncongregated. The water in the vicinity will plainly show the jarring\r\nof the ground.\r\n\r\nThis bellow is a thundering, rumbling sound; and when it is combined\r\nwith the startling hisses, blowings, sighs, and deep-breathed snorts\r\nwhich the creature can produce at will, no one will be likely to\r\ndispute that his collection of diabolical noises is quite complete.\r\n\r\nDuring the period of incubation the female alligator is a devoted\r\nmother. She does not desert her nest from the time that the eggs are\r\nlaid until they are hatched--lying concealed in the scrub close\r\nby--and she is naturally, at this time, most dangerous to approach,\r\nalthough her vigilance does not always save a portion of her unhatched\r\nprogeny from the numerous enemies that have a fondness for alligator\r\nomelet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GROUP OF CAPTIVE ALLIGATORS. From photograph by O. P.\r\nHareus, Jacksonville.]\r\n\r\nThe nest is a large, well-rounded heap or mound, composed of sand and\r\nrubbish, which she drags and pushes together with her claws.\r\nThroughout this mound she deposits her eggs, from forty to seventy and\r\nover. These eggs resemble those of a goose, only that they are larger;\r\nthey have a thick, tough shell, and are of about the same size at both\r\nends. In about sixty days, the heat of the sun, combined with the\r\nwarmth and moisture generated by the fermentation of the rubbish,\r\ncompletes the process of incubation, and the little ones begin to come\r\nforth.\r\n\r\nForcing their way through the sand, they hurry down the sloping sides\r\nof the mound, straightway seeking the water by instinct. While these\r\nbaby 'gators are thus kicking and flinging off their shell overcoats\r\nas they emerge from their incubator, perfect little duplicates of\r\ntheir mother--only that they are rather pretty in their clean, glossy,\r\nblack or dark-brown skins, which have orange-colored stripes that\r\ncompletely ring their miniature tails and bodies--she wanders\r\nanxiously about, probably wondering how many of her family will\r\nsucceed in running the very uncertain gantlet of life.\r\n\r\nFor, eaten while in the egg stage by birds and animals, and swallowed\r\nby open-mouthed, expectant fishes, and by other alligators--often led,\r\nif the truth must be told, by the interesting father himself--as soon\r\nas they reach the water, the early days of an alligator are full of\r\ntrouble. That enough escape to prevent extinction, however, goes\r\nalmost without saying.\r\n\r\nAlligators are hunted for their teeth, which find a ready market when\r\nmade up into pretty ornaments; and of late years extensively for their\r\nhides, which make a very handsome leather. For this purpose the older\r\nspecimens are not valuable, their hides being too gnarled, knotty, and\r\nmoss-grown to tan well. After ten or fifteen years the hide coarsens.\r\nIt is always the skin from the under side of the body and head which\r\nis used, that from the back being so heavily armored with tough, horny\r\nplates and shields as to be practically useless. The flesh for food\r\nfinds but few admirers. Like the eggs, it is permeated by a strong,\r\nmusky flavor, too rank to find appreciation from a refined palate; but\r\nin some places the steaks from the reptile are eaten by the negroes\r\nand pronounced good.\r\n\r\nTo successfully hunt the alligator requires experience, for quick work\r\nis necessary, the brute disappearing at the least suspicion of danger.\r\nHunting by \"jack\" is the usual method pursued, for the light seems to\r\ncharm the creature, so that he may be more easily detained until a\r\nproperly directed bullet speedily puts an end to his existence.\r\n\r\nA professional alligator hunter, or a \"'gator man,\" as he is called,\r\nleads a life full of adventure, but his business is upon the wane,\r\nsince the fad for alligator leather is being pushed aside to make way\r\nfor something later and more novel. Nevertheless, a description of his\r\noutfit may not be uninteresting.\r\n\r\nA most important adjunct to this outfit is the man who usually\r\naccompanies the 'gator man upon his expeditions. He might properly be\r\ncalled the silent partner, for his duty is to instantly and silently\r\nobey the different hand signals, meaning \"To the right,\" \"To the\r\nleft,\" \"Stop,\" \"Back,\" \"Hurry,\" \"Forward,\" \"Spurt,\" \"Slow,\" given by\r\nthe hunter, while standing erect in the bow of the boat, when out with\r\nthe \"jack.\" Indeed, upon his alertness depends much of the success or\r\nfailure of the night's work.\r\n\r\nThe other tools used by the 'gator man are a light, strong boat, a\r\npair of light oars and a broad-bladed paddle with a four-foot handle,\r\nneatly coiled rope, a jack lamp furnished with a powerful reflector,\r\nan axe, a long, keen-bladed hunting knife, two guns (twelve-bore\r\nbreech-loaders, for a heavy charge at one delivery is absolutely\r\nnecessary), bags of ammunition, some strong chains, rawhide rope, and\r\na 'gator pole. This last-mentioned \"tool\" is a stout pole about ten\r\nfeet long, armed with a heavy hook of quarter-inch iron, bearing a\r\nbarbed shank of two inches or more, and it is used for hauling the\r\ndead alligators from the bottom, for the creatures sink as soon as\r\nkilled.\r\n\r\nThe brilliant rays from the \"jack\" reveal a curious and a grewsome\r\nsight when thrown upon a bank or island upon which a group of the\r\ncreatures have congregated. The shining waters of the swamp, so still\r\nand black at that hour of midnight; the hideous tangle of huge gray\r\nforms, as a dozen or more alligators, fairly intoxicated by the gleam\r\nof the mysterious light, steadfastly watch its incomprehensible\r\npresence. Gazing intently, their evil eyes blood-red in the glare from\r\nthe powerful reflector, some lie motionless, others roar and hiss and\r\nsnort with thrilling fierceness as the mystery deepens, incessantly\r\narching their bodies, then alternately depressing them to the ground.\r\nStill others, crawling from beneath their companions, scuffle angrily\r\nto the front, and stand with jaws partly open--now and then slowly\r\ninflating their lungs, until their throats and sides puff out like\r\nbellows. Yet, strange to say, instinct seems to warn the mother\r\nalligator, for there she may be seen quietly creeping away with her\r\nyoung.\r\n\r\nThen, the loud reports from the guns, and the mystery is dispelled!\r\nThe island is deserted, and the work of raising the successfully shot\r\nsaurians begins.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     Boards of rural engineering, syndicates of specialists\r\n     organized in several of the countries of northern Europe to\r\n     look after drainage and irrigation, have rendered great\r\n     services to the populations of the country districts. With\r\n     their aid 591 villages in Alsace-Lorraine were provided with\r\n     water between 1881 and 1895, and 516 communes in Baden have\r\n     been benefited by their assistance. The expense of the\r\n     improvement has not exceeded $6.61 (33 francs) per\r\n     inhabitant. The Agricultural Bureau in Prussia has in the\r\n     past five years drawn the plans and directed the work of 554\r\n     hydraulic syndicates, covering a total surface of more than\r\n     600,000 acres. A numerous body of these agricultural\r\n     engineers is formed every year in Germany, 517 students\r\n     having pursued the course of the section of rural\r\n     engineering in 1893 in the agronomical institutes of Bonn\r\n     and Berlin alone.\r\n\r\n     It is generally accepted that the spider is a solitary\r\n     animal, that will tolerate no companions, even the male\r\n     being in danger of being devoured by his female. But a\r\n     spider--the _Stregodyphus gregarius_--is described as living\r\n     in the Transvaal in communities, including males and\r\n     females, young and old. The nests are sometimes voluminous\r\n     and have partitions and numerous passages running through\r\n     them. The spiders usually escape observation by wrapping\r\n     themselves in dry leaves that hang from stems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RACIAL GEOGRAPHY OF EUROPE.\r\n\r\nA SOCIOLOGICAL STUDY.\r\n\r\n(_Lowell Institute Lectures, 1896._)\r\n\r\nBY WILLIAM Z. RIPLEY, PH. D.,\r\n\r\nASSISTANT PROFESSOR OF SOCIOLOGY, MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF\r\nTECHNOLOGY; LECTURER IN ANTHROPO-GEOGRAPHY AT COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUPPLEMENT.--THE JEWS (_continued_).\r\n\r\nTradition has long divided the Jewish people into two distinct\r\nbranches: the Sephardim, or southern, and the Ashkenazim, or north,\r\nEuropean. Mediæval legend among the Jews themselves traced the descent\r\nof the first from the tribe of Judah; the second, from that of\r\nBenjamin. The Sephardim are mainly the remnants of the former Spanish\r\nand Portuguese Jews. They constitute in their own eyes an aristocracy\r\nof the nation. They are found primarily to-day in Africa; in the\r\nBalkan states, where they are known as Spagnuoli; less purely in\r\nFrance and Italy. A small colony in London and Amsterdam still holds\r\nitself aloof from all communion and intercourse with its brethren. The\r\nAshkenazim branch is numerically far more important, for the German,\r\nRussian, and Polish Jews comprise over nine tenths of the people, as\r\nwe have already seen in our preceding article.\r\n\r\nEarly observers all describe these two branches of the Jews as very\r\ndifferent in appearance. Vogt, in his Lectures on Man, assumes the\r\nPolish type to be descended from Hindu sources, while the Spanish\r\nalone he held to be truly Semitic. Weisbach[11] gives us the best\r\ndescription of the Sephardim Jew as to-day found at Constantinople. He\r\nis slender in habit, he says; almost without exception the head is\r\n\"exquisitely\" elongated and narrow, the face a long oval; the nose\r\nhooked and prominent, but thin and finely chiseled; hair and eyes\r\ngenerally dark, sometimes, however, tending to a reddish blond. This\r\nrufous tendency in the Oriental Jew is emphasized by many observers.\r\nDr. Beddoe[12] found red hair as frequent in the Orient as in Saxon\r\nEngland, although later results do not fully bear it out.[13] This\r\ndescription of a reddish Oriental type corresponds certainly to the\r\nearly representations of the Saviour; it is the type, in features,\r\nperhaps, rather than hair, painted by Rembrandt--the Sephardim in\r\nAmsterdam being familiar to him, and appealing to the artist in\r\npreference to the Ashkenazim type. This latter is said to be\r\ncharacterized by heavier features in every way. The mouth, it is\r\nalleged, is more apt to be large, the nose thickish at the end, less\r\noften clearly Jewish, perhaps. The lips are full and sensual, offering\r\nan especial contrast to the thin lips of the Sephardim. The complexion\r\nis swarthy oftentimes, the hair and eyes very constantly dark, without\r\nthe rufous tendency which appears in the other branch. The face is at\r\nthe same time fuller, the breadth corresponding to a relatively short\r\nand round head.\r\n\r\nDoes this contrast of the traditional Sephardim and Ashkenazim facial\r\ntypes correspond to the anthropometric criteria by means of which we\r\nhave analyzed the various populations of Europe? And, first of all, is\r\nthere the difference of head form between the two which our\r\ndescriptions imply?[14] And, if so, which represents the primitive\r\nSemitic type of Palestine? The question is a crucial one. It involves\r\nthe whole matter of the original physical derivation of the people,\r\nand the rival claims to purity of descent of the two branches of the\r\nnation. In preceding papers we have learned that western Asia is quite\r\nuniformly characterized by an exceeding broad-headedness, the cephalic\r\nindex--that is to say, the breadth of the head in percentage of the\r\nlength from front to back--often rising to 86. This is especially\r\nmarked in Asia Minor, where some of the broadest and shortest crania\r\nin the world are to be found. The Armenians, for example, are so\r\npeculiar in this respect that their heads appear almost deformed, so\r\nflattened are they at the back. A head of the description appears in\r\nthe case of our Jew from Ferghanah on our second portrait page, 344.\r\nOn the other hand, the peoples of African or negroid derivation form a\r\nradical contrast, their heads being quite long and narrow, with\r\nindices ranging from 75 to 78. This is the type of the living Arab\r\nto-day. Its peculiarity appears in the prominence of the occipital\r\nregion in our Arab and other African portraits. Scientific research\r\nupon these Arabs has invariably yielded harmonious results. From the\r\nCanary Islands,[15] all across northern Africa,[16] to central Arabia\r\nitself,[17] the cephalic indices of the nomadic Arabs agree closely.\r\nThey denote a head form closely allied to that of the long-headed\r\nIberian races, typified in the modern Spaniards, south Italians, and\r\nGreeks. It was the head form of the ancient Phoenicians and Egyptians\r\nalso, as has recently been proved beyond all question.[18] Thus does\r\nthe European Mediterranean type shade off in head form, as in\r\ncomplexion also, into the primitive anthropological type of the negro.\r\nThe situation being thus clearly defined, it should be relatively easy\r\nto trace our modern Jews, if, indeed, as has so long been assumed,\r\nthey have remained a pure and undefiled race during the course of\r\ntheir incessant migrations. We should be able to trace their origin if\r\nthey possess any distinctive head form, either to the one continent or\r\nthe other, with comparative certainty.\r\n\r\n  -------------------------+--------------------+----------+------------\r\n        AUTHORITY.         |     Place.         |  Number. | Cephalic\r\n                           |                    |          |  Index.\r\n  -------------------------+--------------------+----------+------------\r\n  Lombroso, 1894 a         |Turin, Italy.       |   112    |  82.0\r\n  Weisbach, '77            |Balkan states.      |    19    |  82.2\r\n  Majer and Kopernicki, '77|Galicia.            |   316    |  83.6\r\n  Blechmann, '82           |W.

These have\r\nnaturally for the most part been taken from the Great Russian and\r\nPolish branch; a few observers, as Lombroso, Ikof, Jacobs, Glück, and\r\nLivi, have taken observations upon a more or less limited number from\r\nsouthern Europe. For purposes of comparison we have reproduced in our\r\nfootnote a summary of all the results obtained thus far. Inspection of\r\nthe table shows a surprising uniformity. Ikof's limited series of\r\nSpagnuoli from Constantinople, and that of the Jews from Caucasia and\r\nDaghestan, are the only ones whose cephalic index lies outside the\r\nlimits of 80 to 83. In other words, the Jews, wherever found in\r\nEurope, betray a remarkable similarity in head form, the crania being\r\nconsiderably broader than among the peoples of Teutonic descent. As we\r\nknow, the extremes of head form in Europe, measured by the cephalic\r\nindex, extend from 74 to 89; we thus observe that the Jews take a\r\nplace rather high in the European series. They are about like the\r\nnorthern French and southern Germans. More important still, they seem\r\nto be generally very closely akin in head form to the people among\r\nwhom they reside. Thus, in Russia and Poland scarcely an appreciable\r\ndifference exists in this respect between Jews and Christians. The\r\nsame is true in Turin, while in the direction of Asia our Jews are as\r\nbullet-headed as even the most typical Armenians and Caucasians round\r\nabout them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ARAB. Index, 76.\r\n\r\nMUSSULMAN, TUNIS. Index, 75.\r\n\r\nJEW, TUNIS. Index, 75.\r\n\r\nAFRICAN SEMITIC TYPES.]\r\n\r\nThis surprising similarity of head form between the Jews of North and\r\nSouth Europe bears hard upon the long-accepted theory that the\r\nSephardim is dolichocephalic, thereby remaining true to the original\r\nSemitic type borne to-day by the Arabs. It has quite universally been\r\naccepted that the two branches of the Jews differed most materially in\r\nhead form. From the facial dissimilarity of the two a correlative\r\ndifference in head form was a gratuitous inference. Dr. Beddoe\r\nobserves that in Turkey the Spagnuoli \"seemed\" to him to be more\r\ndolichocephalic. A few years later Barnard Davis (1867) \"suspected\" a\r\ndiversity, but had only three Italian skulls to judge from, so that\r\nhis testimony counts for little. Then Weisbach (1877) referred to the\r\n\"exquisitely\" long heads of the Spagnuoli, but his data show a\r\ndifferent result. Ikof, with his small series of crania from\r\nConstantinople, is the only observer who got a result which accords in\r\nany degree with what we know of the head form of the modern Semitic\r\npeoples. On the other hand, Glück in Bosnia and Livi in Italy find no\r\nother sign of long-headedness than a slight drop in index of a point\r\nor two. Jacobs, in England, whose methods, as Topinard has observed,\r\nare radically defective, gives no averages for his Sephardim, but they\r\nappear to include about eleven per cent less pure long-headed types\r\nthan even their Ashkenazim brethren in London. This, it will be noted,\r\nis the exact opposite of what might normally be expected. This tedious\r\nsummary forces us inevitably to the conclusion that, while a\r\nlong-headed type of Sephardim Jews may exist, the law is very far from\r\nbeing satisfactorily established.\r\n\r\nThus, from a study of our primary characteristic--the proportions of\r\nthe head--we find our modern Jews endowed with a relatively much\r\nbroader head than that of the average Englishman, for example: while\r\nthe best living representative of the Semitic race, the Arab, has a\r\nhead which is even longer and narrower than our own type. It is, in\r\nshort, one of the longest known, being in every way distinctly\r\nAfrican. The only modern Jews who even approach this type would seem\r\nto be those who actually reside to-day in Africa, as in the case of\r\nour two portrait types from that region. Two possible explanations are\r\nopen to us: either the great body of the Jews in Europe\r\nto-day--certainly all the Ashkenazim, who form upward of ninety per\r\ncent of the nation, and quite probably the Sephardim also, except\r\npossibly those in Africa--have departed widely from the parental type\r\nin Palestine; or else the original Semitic type was broad-headed, and,\r\nby inference, distinctly Asiatic in derivation; in which case it is\r\nthe modern Arab which has deviated from its original pattern. Ikof is\r\nthe only authority who boldly faces this dilemma, and chooses the\r\nAsiatic hypothesis with his eyes open.[19] Which, we leave it to the\r\nreader to decide, would be the more likely to vary--the wandering Jew,\r\never driven from place to place by constant persecution, and\r\nconstantly exposed to the vicissitudes of life in densely populated\r\ncities, the natural habitat of the people, as we have said; or the\r\nequally nomadic Arab, who, however, seems to be invariable in type,\r\nwhether in Algeria, Morocco, the Canary Islands, or Arabia Felix\r\nitself? There can be but one answer, it seems to us. The original\r\nSemitic stock must have been in origin strongly dolichocephalic--that\r\nis to say, African as the Arabs are to-day; from which it follows,\r\nnaturally, that about nine tenths of the living Jews are as widely\r\ndifferent in head form from the parent stock to-day as they well could\r\nbe. The boasted purity of descent of the Jews is, then, a myth. Renan\r\n(1883) is right, after all, in his assertion that the ethnographic\r\nsignificance of the word Jew, for the Russian and Danubian branch at\r\nleast, long ago ceased to exist. Or, as Lombroso observes, the modern\r\nJews are physically more Aryan than Semitic, after all. They have\r\nunconsciously taken on to a large extent the physical traits of the\r\npeople among whom their lot has been thrown. In Algiers they have\r\nremained long-headed like their neighbors, for, even if they\r\nintermarried, no tendency to deviation in head form would be provoked.\r\nIf, on the other hand, they settled in Piedmont, Austria, or Russia,\r\nwith their moderately round-headed populations, they became in time\r\nassimilated to the type of these neighbors as well.\r\n\r\nNothing is simpler than to substantiate the argument of a constant\r\nintercourse and intermixture of Jews with the Christians about them\r\nall through history, from the original exodus of the forty thousand\r\n(?) from Jerusalem after the destruction of the second temple. At this\r\ntime the Jewish nation as a political entity ceased to exist. An\r\nimportant consideration to be borne in mind in this connection, as\r\nNeubauer suggests very aptly, is that opposition to mixed marriages\r\nwas primarily a prejudice of religion and not of race. It was\r\ndissipated on the conversion of the Gentile to Judaism. In fact, in\r\nthe early days of Judaism marriage with a nonbeliever was not\r\ninvalid at all, as it afterward became, according to the Jewish\r\ncode. Thus Josephus, speaking of the Jews at Antioch, mentions that\r\nthey made many converts, receiving them into their community. An\r\nextraordinary number of conversions to Judaism undoubtedly took place\r\nduring the second century after Christ. As to the extent of\r\nintermarriage which ensued during the middle ages discussion is still\r\nrife. Renan, Neubauer, and others interpret the various rigid\r\nprohibitions against intermarriage of Jews with Christians--as, for\r\nexample, at the church councils of 538, 589, at Toledo, and of 743 at\r\nRome--to mean the prevalent danger of such practices becoming general;\r\nwhile Jacobs, Andree, and others are inclined to place a lower\r\nestimate upon their importance. Two wholesale conversions are known to\r\nhave taken place: the classical one of the Khozars, in South Russia,\r\nduring the reign of Charlemagne, and that of the Falashas, who were\r\nneighboring Arab tribes in Yemen. Jacobs has ably shown, however, the\r\nrelatively slight importance of these. It is probable that the\r\ngreatest amount of infusion of Christian blood must have taken place,\r\nin any event, not so much through such striking conversions, as\r\ninsidiously through clandestine or irregular marriages.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FERGHANAH, TURKESTAN.\r\n\r\nHÉRAULT, FRANCE.\r\n\r\nELIZABETHGRAD, RUSSIA.\r\n\r\nSPAGNUOLI, BOSNIA.\r\n\r\nELIZABETHGRAD, RUSSIA.\r\n\r\nJEWISH TYPES.]\r\n\r\nWe find, for example, much prohibitive legislation against the\r\nemployment of Christian servants by Jews. This was directed against\r\nthe danger of conversion to Judaism, by the master, with consequent\r\nintermarriage. It is not likely that these prohibitions were of much\r\navail, for, despite stringent laws in Hungary, for example, we find\r\nthe archbishop of that country reporting in 1229 that many Jews were\r\nillegally living with Christian wives, and that conversions by\r\nthousands were taking place. In any case, no protection for slaves was\r\never afforded. The confinement of the Jews strictly to the Ghettos\r\nduring the later centuries would naturally discourage such\r\nintermixture of blood, as also the increasing popular hatred between\r\nJew and Christian; but, on the other hand, the greater degree of\r\ntolerance enjoyed by the Israelites even during this present century\r\nwould be competent speedily to produce great results. Jacobs has\r\nstrenuously, although perhaps somewhat inconclusively, argued in favor\r\nof a substantial purity of the Jews by means of a number of other\r\ndata--such as, for example, by a study of the relative frequency of\r\nJewish names, by the supposed relative infecundity of mixed marriages,\r\nand the like. Experience and the facts of everyday observation, on the\r\nother hand, tend to confirm us in the belief that racially no purity\r\nof descent is to be supposed for an instant. Consider the evidence of\r\nnames, for example. We may admit a considerable purity, perhaps, to\r\nthe Cohns and Cohens, legitimate descendants of the Cohanim, the sons\r\nof Aaron, early priests of the temple. Their marital relations were\r\nsafeguarded against infusion of foreign blood in every possible way.\r\nThe name is, perhaps, in its various forms, the most frequent among\r\nJews to-day. But how shall we account for the equally pure Jewish\r\nnames in origin, such as Davis, Harris, Phillips, and Hart? How did\r\nthey ever stray so far from their original ethnic and religious\r\nsignificance, unless the marital bars were lowered to a large degree?\r\nSome of them certainly claim a foremost position numerically in our\r\nChristian English directories. We have an interesting case of\r\nindefinite Jewish delimitation in our portraits. The middle portrait\r\nat page 341 is certainly a Jewish type. Dr. Bertholon writes me that\r\nall who saw it immediately asserted it to be a Jew. Yet the man was a\r\nprofessed Mussulman, in fact, even though his face was against him.\r\n\r\nThere is, as we have sought to prove, no single uniform type of head\r\npeculiar to the Jewish people which may be regarded as in any sense\r\nracially hereditary. Is this true also of the face? Our first\r\nstatement encounters no popular disapproval, for most of us never,\r\nperhaps, happened to think of this head form as characteristic. But\r\nthe face, the features! Is this another case of science running\r\ncounter to popular belief?\r\n\r\nThe first characteristic to impress itself upon the layman is that the\r\nJew is generally a brunette. All scientific observers corroborate this\r\nimpression, agreeing in that the dark hair and eyes of this people\r\nreally constitute a distinct racial trait. About two thirds of the\r\nAshkenazim branch in Galicia and Russia, where the general population\r\nis relatively quite blond, is of the brunette type, this being\r\nespecially marked in the darker color of the hair. For example, Majer\r\nand Kopernicki,[20] in Galicia, found dark hair to be about twice as\r\nfrequent as the light. Elkind,[21] in Warsaw, finds about three fifths\r\nof the men dark. In Bosnia, Glück's observations on the Sephardim type\r\ngave him only two light-haired men out of fifty-five. In Germany and\r\nAustria[22] this brunette tendency is likewise strongly emphasized.\r\nPure brunette types are twice as frequent in the latter country, and\r\nthree times as frequent in Germany, among Jewish as among Christian\r\nschool children. Facts also seem to bear out the theory, to which we\r\nhave already alluded, that the Oriental Jews betray a slightly greater\r\nblond tendency, thus inclining to rufous. In Germany also the blond\r\ntendency becomes appreciably more frequent in Alsace-Lorraine, a\r\nformer center of gravity of the nation, as the map in our previous\r\narticle has shown. This comparative blondness of the Alsatian Jew is\r\nnot new, for in 1861 the origin of these same blondes was matter of\r\ncontroversy. Broca believed them to be of northern derivation, while\r\nPruner Bey traced them from a blondish Eastern source. The English\r\nJews seem also to be slightly lighter than their continental brethren,\r\neven despite their presumably greater proportion of Sephardim, who are\r\nsupposed to be peculiarly dark. As to the relative red blondness of\r\nthe Oriental Jew, the early observations of Dr. Beddoe, and those of\r\nLangerhans (1873) as to the blue eyes and red-brown hair of the Druses\r\nof Lebanon, do not seem to be borne out; or, as Jacobs puts it, the\r\n\"argument may be dismissed with costs.\" Certainly the living Semites\r\nare dark enough in type, and the evidence of the sacred books bears\r\nout the same theory of an original dark type. Thus \"black\" and \"hair\"\r\nare commonly synonymous in the early Semitic languages. In any case,\r\nwhatever the color in the past, we have seen that science corroborates\r\nthe popular impression that the Jews as a people are distinctively of\r\na brunette type. This constitutes one of the principal traits by which\r\nthey may be almost invariably identified. It is not without interest\r\nto notice that this brunetteness is more accentuated, oftentimes,\r\namong the women, who are, the world over, persistent conservators of\r\nthe primitive physical characteristics of a people.[23]\r\n\r\nSecondly, as to the nose. Popularly the humped or hook nose\r\nconstitutes the most distinctive feature of the Jewish face.\r\nObservations among the Jews, in their most populous centers, do not,\r\nhowever, bear out the theory. Thus Majer and Kopernicki (1885), in\r\ntheir extended series, found only nine per cent of the hooked type--no\r\ngreater frequency than among the Poles; a fact which Weissenberg\r\nconfirms as to the relative scarcity of the convex nose in profile\r\namong his South Russian Jews. He agrees, however, that the nose is\r\noften large, thick, and prominent. Weisbach (1877) measured the facial\r\nfeatures of nineteen Jews, and found the largest noses in a long\r\nseries of people from all over the earth; exceeded in length, in fact,\r\nby the Patagonians alone. The hooked nose is, indeed, sometimes\r\nfrequent outside the Jewish people. Olechnowicz found, for example,\r\nover a third of the noses of the gentry in southeast Poland to be of\r\nthis hooked variety. Running the eye over our carefully chosen series\r\nof portraits, selected for us as typical from four quarters\r\nof Europe--Algeria, Russia, Bosnia, and the confines of\r\nAsia--representing the African, Balkan Spagnuoli, and Russian\r\nAshkenazim varieties, visual impression will also confirm our\r\ndeduction. The Jewish nose is not so often truly convex in profile.\r\nNevertheless, it must be confessed that it gives a hooked impression.\r\nThis seems to be due to a peculiar \"tucking up of the wings,\" as Dr.\r\nBeddoe expresses it. Herein lies the real distinctive quality about\r\nit, rather than in any convexity of outline. In fact, it often\r\nrenders a nose concave in profile, immediately recognizable as Jewish.\r\nJacobs[24] has ingeniously described this \"nostrility,\" as he calls\r\nit, by the following diagrams: Write, he says, a figure 6 with a long\r\ntail (Fig. 1); now remove the turn of the twist, and much of the\r\nJewishness disappears; and it vanishes entirely when we draw the lower\r\ncontinuation horizontally, as in Fig. 3. Behold the transformation!\r\nThe Jew has turned Roman beyond a doubt. What have we proved, then?\r\nThat there is in reality such a phenomenon as a Jewish nose, even\r\nthough it be differently constituted from our first assumption. A\r\nmoment's inspection of our series of portraits will convince the\r\nskeptic that this trait, next to the prevalent dark hair and eyes and\r\nthe swarthy skin, is the most distinctive among the chosen people.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 1._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 2._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 3._]\r\n\r\nAnother characteristic of the Jewish physiognomy is the eyes. The\r\neyebrows, seemingly thick because of their darkness, appear to be\r\nnearer together than usual, arching smoothly into the lines of the\r\nnose. The lids are rather full, the eyes large, dark, and brilliant. A\r\ngeneral impression of heaviness is apt to be given. In favorable cases\r\nthis imparts a dreamy, melancholy, or thoughtful expression to the\r\ncountenance; in others it degenerates into a blinking, drowsy type;\r\nor, again, with eyes half closed, it may suggest suppressed cunning.\r\nThe particular adjective to be applied to this expression varies\r\ngreatly according to the personal equation of the observer. Quite\r\npersistent also is a fullness of the lips, often amounting in the\r\nlower one almost to a pout. The chin in many cases is certainly rather\r\npointed and receding, Jacobs to the contrary notwithstanding. A\r\nfeature of my own observation, perhaps not fully justified, is a\r\npeculiar separation of the teeth, which seem to stand well apart from\r\none another. But a truce to speculations. Entering into greater\r\ndetail, the flat contradictions of different observers show that they\r\nare vainly generalizing from an all too narrow base of observations.\r\nEven the fancied differences in feature between the two great branches\r\nof the Hebrew people seem to us to be of doubtful existence. Our\r\nportraits do not bear it out. It seems rather that the two\r\ndescriptions of the Ashkenazim and Sephardim types which we have\r\nquoted denote rather the distinction between the faces of those of the\r\nupper and the lower classes. Enough for us to know that there is a\r\nsomething Jewish in these faces which we instantly detect. We\r\nrecognize it in Rembrandt's Hermitage, or in Munkaczy's Christ before\r\nPilate. Not invariable are these traits. Not even to the Jew himself\r\nare they always a sure criterion. Weissenberg gives an interesting\r\nexample of this.[25] To a friend, a Jew in Elizabethgrad, he submitted\r\ntwo hundred and fifty photographs of Russian Jews and Christians in\r\nundistinctive costume. Seventy per cent of the Jews were rightly\r\nchosen, while but ten per cent of the Russians were wrongly classed as\r\nJews. Of what concern is it whether this characterization be entirely\r\nfeatural, or in part a matter of expression? The first would be a\r\nmatter of direct heredity, the second hypothesis partakes more of the\r\nnature of a characteristic acquired from the social environment. Some\r\none--Jacobs, I think--speaks of it as the \"expression of the Ghetto.\"\r\nIt certainly appears in the remarkable series of composite Jewish\r\nportraits published in his monograph. It would not be surprising to\r\nfind this true. Continued hardship, persecution, a desperate struggle\r\nagainst an inexorable human environment as well as natural one, could\r\nnot but write its lines upon the face. The impression of a dreary past\r\nis deep sunk in the bodily proportions, as we have seen. Why not in\r\nthe face as well?\r\n\r\nWe are now prepared, in conclusion, to deal with what is perhaps the\r\nmost interesting phase of our discussion. It is certainly, if true, of\r\nprofound sociological importance. We have in these pages spoken at\r\nlength of the head form--primary index of race; we have shown that\r\nthere are Jews and Jews in this respect. Yet which was the real Jew it\r\nwas not for us to decide, for the ninety-and-nine were broad-headed,\r\nwhile the Semite in the East is still, as ever, a long-headed member\r\nof the Africanoid races. This discouraged our hopes of proving the\r\nexistence of a Jewish cephalic type as the result of purity of\r\ndescent. It may indeed be affirmed with certainty that the Jews are by\r\nhereditary descent from early times no purer than most of their\r\nEuropean neighbors. Then we discovered evidence that in this head form\r\nthe Jews were often closely akin to the people among whom they lived.\r\nIn long-headed Africa they were dolichocephalic. In brachycephalic\r\nPiedmont, though supposedly of Sephardim descent, they were quite like\r\nthe Italians of Turin. And all over Slavic Europe no distinction in\r\nhead form between Jew and Christian existed. In the Caucasus also they\r\napproximate closely the cranial characteristics of their neighbors.\r\nHypnotic suggestion was not needed to find a connection here,\r\nespecially since all history bore us out in our assumption of a large\r\ndegree of intermixture of Gentile blood. Close upon this disproval of\r\npurity of type by descent came evidence of a distinct uniformity of\r\nfacial type. Even so impartial an observer as Weissenberg--certainly\r\nnot prejudiced in favor of cephalic invariability--confesses this\r\nfeatural unity.\r\n\r\nHow shall we solve this enigma of ethnic purity, and yet impurity, of\r\ntype? In this very apparent contradiction lies the grain of comfort\r\nfor our sociological hypothesis. The Jew is radically mixed in the\r\nline of _racial descent_; he is, on the other hand, the legitimate\r\nheir to all Judaism as a matter of _choice_. It is for us a case of\r\npurely artificial selection, operative as ever only in those physical\r\ntraits which appeal to the senses. It is precisely analogous to our\r\nexample of the Basques in France and Spain. What we have said of them\r\nwill apply with equal force here. Both Jews and Basques possessed in a\r\nhigh degree a \"consciousness of kind\"; they were keenly sensible of\r\ntheir social individuality. The Basques primarily owed theirs to\r\ngeographical isolation and a peculiar language; that of the Jews was\r\nderived from the circumstances of social isolation, dependent upon the\r\ndictates of religion. Another case in point occurs to us in this\r\nconnection. Chantre,[26] in a recent notable work, has shown the\r\nremarkable uniformity in physical type among the Armenians. They are\r\nso peculiar in head form that we in America recognize them at once by\r\ntheir foreshortened and sugar-loaf skulls, almost devoid of occiput.\r\nThey too, like the Jews, have long been socially isolated in their\r\nreligion. Thus in all these cases, Basques, Armenians, and Jews, we\r\nhave a potent selective force at work. So far as in their power lay,\r\nthe individuality of all these people was encouraged and perpetuated\r\nas one of their dearest possessions. It affected every detail of their\r\nlives. Why should it not also react upon their ideal of physical\r\nbeauty? and why not influence their sexual preferences, as well as to\r\ndetermine their choice in marriage? Its results became thus\r\naccentuated through heredity. But all this would be accomplished, be\r\nit especially noted, only in so far as the physical traits were\r\nconsciously or unconsciously impressed upon them by the facts of\r\nobservation. There arises at once the difference between artificial\r\nselection in the matter of the head form and that concerning the\r\nfacial features. One is an unsuspected possession of individuality,\r\nthe other is matter of common notice and, it may be, of report. What\r\nJew or Christian, till he became anthropologist, ever stopped to\r\nconsider the shape of his head, any more than the addition of a number\r\nof cubits to his stature? Who has not, on the other hand, early\r\nacquired a distinct concept of a Jewish face and of a distinctly\r\nJewish type? Could such a potent fact escape observation for a moment?\r\n\r\nWe are confirmed in our belief in the potency of an artificial\r\nselection, such as we have described, to perpetuate or to evolve a\r\nJewish facial type by reason of another observation. The women among\r\nthe Jews, as Jacobs[27] notes, in confirmation of our own belief,\r\nbetray far more constantly than the men the outward characteristics\r\npeculiar to the people. We have already cited Weissenberg's testimony\r\nthat brunetteness is twice as prevalent among Russian Jewesses as\r\namong the men. Of course this may be a matter of anabolism, pure and\r\nsimple. This would be perhaps a competent explanation of the\r\nphenomenon for physiologists like Geddes and Thompson. For us this\r\nother cause may be more directly responsible. Artificial selection in\r\na social group, wherein the active choice of mates falls to the share\r\nof the male, would seem to tend in the direction of an accentuated\r\ntype in that more passive sex on which the selective influence\r\ndirectly plays. At all events, observations from widely scattered\r\nsources verify the law that the facial individuality of a people is\r\nmore often than otherwise expressed most clearly in the women. Thus,\r\nfor example, the women betray the Mongol type more constantly than the\r\nmen among the Asiatic tribes of eastern Russia.[28] On the other hand,\r\nMainof, best of authority, confirms the same tendency among those of\r\nFinnic descent.[29] The _Setti Communi_ in northern Italy still\r\npreserve their German language as evidence of a historic Teutonic\r\ndescent. They seem to have lost their identity entirely in respect of\r\nthe head form,[30] but Ranke[31] states that among the women the\r\nGerman facial type constantly reappears. This, I confess, is not\r\naltogether easy to understand, unless the Lombards, of whom these\r\ncolonies are supposedly the remnants, brought their native women with\r\nthem across the Alps. Perhaps, however, not bringing their women, a\r\nnew Teutonic resemblance has been evolved out of whole cloth. A better\r\nexample than this is offered among the Hamitic peoples of Africa north\r\nof the Sahara. These peoples, from Abyssinia to Morocco, really belong\r\nto the white races of Europe. Among nearly all their tribes the\r\nnegroid traits are far more accentuated among the women, according to\r\nSergi.[32] It is not necessary to cite more specific testimony. The\r\nlaw occupies a respected place among anthropologists. That the Jews\r\nconfirm it, would seem to strengthen our hypothesis at every point.\r\n\r\nOur final conclusion, then, is this: It is paradoxical, yet true, we\r\naffirm. The Jews are not a race, but only a people, after all. In\r\ntheir faces we read its confirmation, while in respect of their other\r\ntraits we are convinced that such individuality as they possess--by no\r\nmeans inconsiderable--is of their own making from one generation to\r\nthe next, rather than as a product of an unprecedented purity of\r\nphysical descent.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[11] 1877, p. 214.\r\n\r\n[12] 1861 b, pp. 227 and 331.\r\n\r\n[13] Glück, 1896 a.

For\r\nhe had big splay feet, with all the toes turned forward and joined\r\ntogether in one broad web, and his wings were thick and clumsy, and\r\nunderneath his long bill there was a big red sack that he could fill\r\nwith fishes, and when it was full he could hardly walk or fly, so\r\nlarge the sack was and so great was his appetite.\r\n\r\nBut he kept the sack well filled and he emptied it out every day into\r\nhis stomach, and so he grew very soon to be a large bird, as big as a\r\nturkey, though not as fat, and each day uglier than ever.\r\n\r\nBut one morning, when he was walking out on the sand flat of the\r\nAstillero at Mazatlan, Mexico, where he lived, he saw a big fish which\r\nhad been left by the falling tide in a little pool of water. It was a\r\nblue-colored fish with a big bony head, and no scales, and a sleek,\r\nslippery skin. He did not know that it was a _bagre_, but he thought\r\nthat all fishes were good to eat, so he opened his mouth and slipped\r\nthe fish, tail first, down into his pouch. It went all right for a\r\nwhile, but when the fish woke up and knew he was being swallowed, he\r\nstraightened out both of his arms, and there he was. For the bagre is\r\na kind of catfish, and each arm is a long, stiff, sharp bone, or\r\nspine, with a saw edge the whole length of it. And all the bagre has\r\nto do is just to put this arm out straight and twist it at the\r\nshoulder and then it is set, and no animal can bend or break it. And\r\nit pierced right through the skin of the bird's sack, and the bird\r\ncould not swallow it, nor make it go up nor down, and the bagre held\r\non tight, for he knew that if he let go once he would be swallowed,\r\nand that would be the last of him.\r\n\r\nSo the bird tried everything he could think of, and the fish held on,\r\nand they kept it up all day. In the afternoon a little boy came out on\r\nthe sands. His name was Inocente, and he was the son of Ygnacio, the\r\nfisherman of Mazatlan. And Inocente took a club of mangrove and ran up\r\nto the struggling bird and struck it on the wing with the club. The\r\nblow broke the wing, and the bird lay down to die, for with a broken\r\nwing and a fish that would not go up nor down, there was no hope for\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nWhen Inocente saw what kind of a fish it was, he knew just what to do.\r\nHe reached down into the bird's sack and took hold of the fish's\r\nspines. He gave each one a twist so that it rolled over in its socket,\r\nthe upper part toward the fish's head, and then they were not stiff\r\nany more, but lay flat against the side of the fish, just as they\r\nought to lie. Then the fish knew that it had found a master, and lay\r\nperfectly still. So the bird gave a great gulp, and out the bagre went\r\non the sand, and when the tide came up it swam away, and took care\r\nnever to go again where a bird could get hold of it. And the bird with\r\nthe broken wing had learned something about fishes, too. But he could\r\nnot fly away, so he waited to see what the boy was going to do.\r\n\r\nThe boy took the bird into his boat and brought him home. And old\r\nYgnacio put a splint on his wing and covered it with salve, and by and\r\nby it healed. But the bone was set crooked, and the bird could not fly\r\nvery well. So the boys called the bird Señor Alcatraz, which is the\r\nSpanish for Mr. Pelican, and Señor Alcatraz and all the boys and dogs\r\nand goats became good friends, and all ran about on the streets\r\ntogether. And when the boys would shout and the dogs bark, all Señor\r\nAlcatraz could do was to squawk and hiss and open his big mouth and\r\nshow the inside of his red fish sack.\r\n\r\nAnd when the boys would go fishing on the wharf, Alcatraz would go,\r\ntoo, and he would stow away the fishes in his pouch as fast as the\r\nboys could catch them. But if they caught a bagre fish, he would turn\r\nhis head the other way and then run away home just as fast as his\r\nsplay feet would take him.\r\n\r\nAnd when the men drew the net on the beach Alcatraz would splash\r\naround inside the net, catching whatever he could, and having a great\r\ndeal of fun in his clumsy pelican fashion. Then he would run along the\r\nstreet with the boys, squawking and flapping his wings and thinking\r\nthat he was just like the rest of them. And if you ever go to\r\nMazatlan, ask for Dr. Rogers, and he will show you the way to\r\nYgnacio's cabin on the street they call Libertad. And there in the\r\nfront yard, in a general scramble of dogs, goats, and little Indian\r\nboys, you will see Señor Alcatraz romping and squabbling like the best\r\nof them. And you will know which he is by the broken wing and the red\r\nsack under his throat. But if you say \"Bagre\" to him, he will run\r\nunder the doorstep and hide his face till you go away.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.--THE LITTLE BLUE FOX.\r\n\r\nOnce there was a little blue fox, and his name was Eichkao, and he was\r\na thief. So he built his house down deep among the rocks under the\r\nmoss on the Mist Island, and his little fox children used to stay down\r\namong the rocks. There they would gurgle, gurgle, gurgle, whenever\r\nthey heard anybody walking over their heads. Eichkao and his fox wife\r\nused to run all round over the rocks to find something for them to\r\neat, and whenever Eichkao saw anybody coming he would go clin-n-n-g,\r\ncling-g-g, and his voice was high and sharp, just like the voice of a\r\nbuzz saw.\r\n\r\nOne day he walked out on the rocks over the water and began to talk to\r\nthe black sea parrot, whose name is Epatka, and who sits erect on his\r\ncarelessly built nest with one egg in it, and wears a great big bill\r\nmade of red sealing wax. He has a long white quill pen stuck over each\r\near, and over his face is a white mask, so that nobody can know what\r\nkind of a face he has, and all you can see behind the mask is a pair\r\nof little foolish twinkling white glass eyes. What the two said to\r\neach other I don't know, but they did not talk very long, for in a few\r\nminutes when I came back to his house among the rocks Eichkao was\r\ngone, and there lay out on the bank a bill made of red sealing wax, a\r\nwhite mask, and two little white quill pens. There were a few bones\r\nand claws and some feathers, but they did not seem to belong to\r\nanything in particular, and the little foxes in the rocks went gurgle,\r\ngurgle, gurgle.\r\n\r\nOne day I lay down on the moss out by the old fox walk on the Mist\r\nIsland, and Eichkao saw me there and thought I was some new kind of\r\nwalrus which might be good to eat, and would feed all the little foxes\r\nfor a month. So he ran around me in a circle, and then he ran around\r\nagain, then again and again, always making the circle smaller, until\r\nfinally the circle was so narrow that I could reach him with my hand.\r\nAs he went around and around, all the time he looked at me with his\r\ncold, gray, selfish eye, and not one of all the beasts has an eye as\r\ncruel-cold as his. When he thought that he was near enough, he gave a\r\nsnap with his jaws, and tried to bite out a morsel to take home to the\r\nlittle foxes; but all I offered him was a piece of rubber boot. And\r\nwhen I turned around to look at him he was running away as fast as he\r\ncould, calling klin-n-g-g, klin-n-g, klin-n-g, like a scared buzz saw\r\nall the time as he went out of sight. And I think that he is running\r\nyet, while the little foxes still go gurgle, gurgle under the rocks.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.-HOW THE RED FOX WENT HUNTING.\r\n\r\n(_With acknowledgment to Mr. A. C. Bassett, of Menlo Park,\r\nCalifornia._)\r\n\r\nOnce on a time there was a great tall rabbit, the kind the miners call\r\na \"narrow-gauge mule\"; but he was not a mule at all, and his real name\r\nwas \"Jack Rabbit.\" His home was in Montana, and he lived by the river\r\nthey call the Silver Bow. He could run faster than any of the other\r\nbeasts, and he went lickety-clip, lickety-clip, bounding over the tops\r\nof the sagebrush, for he had no brush of his own to carry.\r\n\r\nAnd there was a red fox who lived on the Silver Bow, too, and he went\r\nhunting because he wanted rabbit for dinner. But while he could run\r\nvery fast he could not bound over the tops of the sagebrush, for his\r\nown brush, which he always carried with him because he was so proud of\r\nit, would catch on the thorns of the other kinds of brush and so would\r\nkeep him back.\r\n\r\nSo he sent for his cousin, the coyote, to come and help him. Now, the\r\ncoyote lived out in the country by Emigrant Mountain. He was not proud\r\nat all, for he hadn't much of a brush, and nobody flattered him for\r\nhis beauty. But for all that the coyote could run very fast, as he had\r\nIndian blood in him. The only trouble was that his hind feet ran\r\nfaster than his fore feet. So he had to stop every little while and\r\nrun sidewise to unkink himself and give his fore feet a chance to\r\ncatch up.\r\n\r\nWhen the coyote came up the rabbit was bounding along through the\r\nbushes, going around in a great circle so that he always came back to\r\nthe same place, for that is the way of the rabbit-folk. So the fox lay\r\nlow and hid his brush in the sage, and the coyote followed the rabbit\r\naround the circle. And he just kept up with the rabbit all the way,\r\nfor the rabbit wasn't scared, and didn't run very fast. And when they\r\nhad gone once around the circle the rabbit passed the hidden fox. Then\r\nthe fox got up and chased him, and was only a few feet behind. And the\r\ncoyote stopped and ran sidewise for a while to unkink himself, and\r\nthen he lay down in the bushes and waited for the rabbit to come back.\r\nThe rabbit was much scared when he saw the fox close behind him, so he\r\nran and bounded very fast, and the fox kept falling behind because he\r\nhad his long brush to carry. But he kept at it just the same, and when\r\nthe rabbit came around the circle to where he started there was the\r\ncoyote waiting for him. The rabbit had to make a great jump to get\r\nover the coyote's head. Then they went around again and the coyote\r\nkept close behind all the way, and the rabbit began to get tired. When\r\nthe coyote's hind legs got tangled up then the fox was rested, and he\r\ntook up the chase; and so they kept on, each one taking his turn,\r\nexcept the rabbit, who had to keep his own turn all the time.\r\n\r\nWhen the race was over there was nobody there to see how they divided\r\nup what they caught. But I saw the coyote the next day, and he looked\r\nso very empty that I think that the red fox must have taken all the\r\nrabbit meat for himself. Most likely he left his cousin just the ears\r\nfor his part, with a rabbit's foot to carry in his pocket for good\r\nluck.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGLACIAL GEOLOGY IN AMERICA.\r\n\r\nBY PROF. DANIEL S. MARTIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder this title the vice-president of Section E (Geology) of the\r\nAmerican Association--Prof. Herman L. Fairchild, of the University of\r\nRochester, New York--gave an admirable _résumé_ of the whole history,\r\nprogress, and scope of the study of ice phenomena in North America, as\r\nthe opening address before the section at the recent Boston meeting.\r\nApart from the interest of the subject in itself considered, this\r\naddress was a model of what such addresses should be. While strictly\r\nscientific, without the least attempt at rhetorical effect, it was at\r\nthe same time so clear, so well arranged and so simple in language,\r\nthat any intelligent auditor could enjoy it and grasp it, and carry\r\naway a distinct impression of the gradual development and present\r\nstatus of this great department of geological study. Professor\r\nFairchild's choice of his subject was happy also in its fitness to the\r\noccasion, as covering almost exactly the half century of the life of\r\nthe association, though going back indeed a few years further, into\r\nthe period of the earlier society which developed into the association\r\nin 1848.\r\n\r\nThe great body of phenomena comprised under the term \"drift,\" and the\r\nsmoothed and scratched surfaces of rock, etc., had been by no means\r\nunnoticed by the early students of American geology, but they were\r\nattributed to violent and widespread water action, and were spoken of\r\nin general as \"diluvial\" formations. When the agency of ice began to\r\nbe recognized, it was regarded as that of floating and stranding\r\nbergs; and this view for a long time contended with the theory of\r\nglacial action, even when the latter had been adopted and advocated by\r\neminent students of the subject.\r\n\r\nThe first allusion to drifting ice as the agent of transportation of\r\nbowlders, etc., appears to have been made as early as 1825, by one\r\nPeter Dobson, of Connecticut, in a letter to Prof. Benjamin Silliman,\r\nof Yale College. Sir Roderick Murchison, who became the great champion\r\nof this view, credits Mr. Dobson's letter with giving him the first\r\nsuggestion of it. Twelve years later, in 1837, T. A. Conrad made the\r\nearliest reference to land ice as the cause of our drift phenomena; he\r\ndoes this in very striking words when read in the light of the studies\r\nand determinations of later years, although of course imperfectly and\r\nvaguely.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, however, Agassiz and others had been working among the\r\nglaciers of the Alps, and their views as to a great period of former\r\nextension, in Europe and the British Isles, were finding some\r\nacceptance abroad. In this country, Prof. Edward Hitchcock, in his\r\naddress as retiring president of the Association of American\r\nGeologists, in 1841, gave a broad and careful review of the drift\r\nphenomena in eastern North America, and referred to the work of\r\nAgassiz, Buckland, and Lyell with great interest, as having given him\r\n\"a new geological sense\" in observing these phenomena, and said, with\r\nprophetic foresight, \"Henceforth, glacial action must form an\r\nimportant chapter in geology.\"\r\n\r\nBut the time was not ripe for the understanding and acceptance of the\r\nglacial theory as a later generation has come to know it. The studies\r\nof Agassiz and his _confrères_ had been among glaciers upon mountain\r\nslopes, and hence, while many of the drift phenomena were strikingly\r\naccounted for, others were not and could not be. So it came to pass\r\nthat, while Professor Hitchcock and others in this country were\r\nstrongly impressed, they were not satisfied, and held for years an\r\nuncertain position. The glacial indications conformed in some aspects\r\nto the theory, but not in others; the striæ and groovings, instead of\r\nfollowing valleys, all had a general trend to the southward, and the\r\nbowlders were carried across great depressions and deposited upon\r\nheights. How could these conditions be due to glaciers? Could ice flow\r\nuphill, or move long distances over level areas? These and other\r\nphenomena, such as the peculiar distribution of drift material, in\r\n\"drumlin\" ridges and the like, had no explanation. Hence,\r\nnotwithstanding President Hitchcock's utterances above quoted, and his\r\nsimilar Postscript on the subject of drift and moraines, appended in\r\nthe same year to his volume on the Geology of Massachusetts, we find\r\nhim in 1843, when again addressing the Association of Geologists,\r\nadopting a modified tone, dwelling upon these points of difficulty,\r\nand seeking a compromise view, which he called \"glacio-aqueous.\" The\r\ngreat influence also of Murchison and Lyell had been thrown into the\r\nscale in favor of the iceberg theory, and this fact doubtless had much\r\nto do with the slow development of true conceptions. Lyell visited\r\nAmerica in 1842, and was present at the American Geologists' meeting,\r\nadvocating the floating-ice doctrine, to which most of our observers\r\nalready leaned; and so the views of Agassiz and the glacial school had\r\nto wait for a decade before they found general acceptance or even\r\naudience.\r\n\r\nThis, we may note in passing, is but one marked instance out of many\r\nin the history of science, wherein the personal influence of eminent\r\nleaders has obstructed and retarded the advance of true knowledge. The\r\nwhole recognition of the Cambrian system, as pre-Silurian and\r\ndistinct, was suppressed and prevented for many years by Murchison's\r\nintense opposition to the views of Sedgwick. Similar facts might be\r\ncited in this country, did we care to mention names. Science can not\r\nclaim, as is sometimes asserted, that it possesses or imparts any\r\nentire exemption from the influence of authority, and bestows complete\r\nindependence from the tendency to \"swear to the words of a master.\"\r\n\r\nOf the New York geologists, Vanuxem alone, in his Geology of the Third\r\nDistrict, 1842, inclined to the glacial theory; the others--Emmons,\r\nMather, and Hall--advocated floating ice, the latter urging as a chief\r\nobjection the absence of any great northern highlands from which\r\nglaciers could extend southward. Prof. Henry D. Rogers advocated De la\r\nBeche's view, of great catastrophic waves or _débacles_ of water and\r\nice, produced by sudden uplifts of the floor of a circumpolar ocean,\r\nand sweeping southward with tremendous power over the middle\r\nlatitudes. These views were presented by him in 1844, at the\r\nWashington meeting of the geologists, and are to us a most curious\r\nillustration of the old \"cataclysmic\" phase of geological conceptions.\r\n\r\nTwo years later Agassiz came to America, and at once set about\r\nstudying the ice evidences here, first in the White Mountains and then\r\naround the Great Lakes. At the first meeting of the American\r\nAssociation, in 1848, he presented his views as to the identity of our\r\nphenomena with those studied by himself, Desor, and Guyot abroad. His\r\nviews were not very warmly received, however, and he did not attempt\r\ntheir public presentation again for some years, turning his attention\r\nmore to the field of zoölogy. In 1850, in a work on Lake Superior, he\r\nrefers somewhat sharply to the prejudice that seemed to prevail in\r\nrelation to this subject.\r\n\r\nFrom this time, however, the aqueous theories began to be less\r\nstrongly presented; and a new generation of geologists was coming on,\r\nlargely under the training of Guyot and Agassiz, and more open to\r\ntheir observed results. C. B. Adams, in 1850, presented a view nearly\r\nakin to that adopted by Dana a few years later, of an elevation of the\r\nhigh northern latitudes, resulting in a southward-moving glacial\r\nsheet, and a subsequent depression connected with its retreat, to\r\naccount for the stratified deposits. Professor Dana accepted this\r\ndoctrine in his presidential address before the association in 1855,\r\nadding the \"Terrace period\" of partial re-elevation. From this time he\r\nbecame the leader of the American glacialists, and his great Manual,\r\nissued in 1862, carried these views into all the colleges of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nIn 1857 Prof. Edward Hitchcock published an important treatise on\r\nSurface Geology, particularly of the Connecticut Valley, in the\r\nSmithsonian Contributions to Knowledge. In this paper he noted the\r\ndistinction, so important and now so familiar, between local striæ and\r\nthose with the general southward course of the \"drift.\" Two years\r\nlater his son, Prof. C. H. Hitchcock, extended this distinction\r\nwidely over New England. In 1863 the report of progress of the\r\nGeological Survey of Canada gave an extended review of the surface\r\ngeology, by Prof. Robert Bell, in which he fully adopted the glacial\r\ntheory. Meantime, also, Professor Ramsay, in England, had abandoned\r\nthe iceberg doctrine for that of glaciers.\r\n\r\nIn 1866 and 1867 important papers appeared by Charles Whittlesey, and\r\none by Edward Hungerford; this last, read before the association,\r\nadopted the general views of Agassiz, with some important limitations\r\nnow generally received. In the same year the revised edition of Dana's\r\nManual gave yet fuller statement and wider diffusion to the generally\r\naccepted views as held to-day.\r\n\r\nProfessor Fairchild sums up this historical sketch as comprising four\r\nperiods--viz., prior to 1841, undisputed reign of diluvial hypotheses;\r\n1841 to 1848, suggestion and discussion of glacial hypotheses; 1849 to\r\n1866, gradual acceptance of the latter view; from 1867 onward,\r\ndevelopment of glacial geology.\r\n\r\nFrom this point, the address was occupied with consideration of the\r\nvarious aspects of the subject as studied and wrought out during the\r\npast twenty years by numerous observers. These are grouped under four\r\nmain heads, each with various subdivisions--viz., (1) the ice sheet,\r\nas to its area, its thickness, its centers of dispersion, its\r\nmigration of centers, etc.; (2) the ice period, as to its cause, its\r\ndivisions, its duration, its distance in time; (3) the interpretation\r\nof special phenomena, such as moraines, drumlins, eskers, \"kettles,\"\r\nand the like, valley drift, terraces, loess, etc.; and (4) existing\r\nglaciers, as discovered on our high mountains of the far West, and as\r\nstudied in closer relation to the ancient phenomena in the great ice\r\ncap of Greenland and the immense glacier development in Alaska.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to go into a detailed review of the numerous points\r\nof interest covered in this discussion. Suffice it to say that one who\r\nheard or who reads it finds an admirably clear and condensed account\r\nof all the problems and phenomena that have been and that are now\r\nencountered in the study of glacial geology on this continent, and of\r\ntheir gradual interpretation and solution by the combined labors of\r\nmany students. The progress of knowledge over this wide field,\r\nadvancing step by step, amid conflicting views and perplexing\r\nconditions, is beautifully shown, and leaves a very striking\r\nimpression on the mind, of the difficulties and the successes of\r\nscientific research. Nor is Professor Fairchild disposed to claim too\r\nmuch or assert too strongly. He recognizes that, with all that has\r\nbeen met and mastered, there are still questions unsolved, and laurels\r\nto be won by others.\r\n\r\nAmong the facts brought out, a few may be briefly alluded to. The\r\nearly abandonment of Agassiz's original view of a vast extension of\r\nthe polar snow caps, and the recognition of separate centers of\r\ncontinental glaciation, now distinctly determined as three in\r\nnumber--a western, a central, and an eastern--the former being the\r\nearliest, and the others following in succession; the recognition by\r\nthe Western geologists of the twofold character of the Glacial epoch,\r\nas also determined in western Europe, but less markedly traceable in\r\nour Eastern States, though now generally admitted; in close relation\r\nto this the determination of the line of the great terminal moraine,\r\ntraced by successive observers from the Atlantic seaboard to\r\nMinnesota, and the subsequent recognition of an older, eroded, and\r\nfragmentary morainal \"fringe,\" marking the line of the earlier ice\r\nsheet, somewhat beyond the later. With regard to the actual distance\r\nof the last glacial retreat, as expressed in years, Professor\r\nFairchild is both cautious and frank. He notes the general consensus\r\nof recent observers toward a much shorter period than was formerly\r\nsupposed--from five to ten or perhaps fifteen thousand years. At the\r\nsame time, there are many elements of uncertainty involved, and the\r\nproblem is by no means settled. The Niagara gorge, so long looked upon\r\nas a possible chronometer, grows more complicated as it is further\r\nstudied; the rate of erosion has evidently varied much with the volume\r\nof water carried by the river; and this, in turn, has varied with the\r\nchanges of level, and consequently of drainage routes, in the basin of\r\nthe Great Lakes. There have been times when only the Erie waters\r\nflowed through the Niagara outlet, the upper lake drainage passing\r\neastward independently, until a gradual northern rise of the land,\r\nwhich is proved to be still going on, turned the entire drainage into\r\nthe present St. Clair route from Lake Huron into Lake Erie, and so\r\nthrough Niagara.\r\n\r\nThis point leads us to digress for a moment from the address under\r\nconsideration to allude to a very interesting department of study that\r\nis now growing into prominence--to wit, the restoration of pre-glacial\r\ngeography and hydrography, and the genesis of our existing river and\r\nlake systems throughout the northern part of the country. The\r\ndiscussions and results in regard to Niagara and the Great Lakes are\r\nsomewhat familiar, but the work on the rivers and smaller lakes is not\r\nso widely known. Professor Fairchild himself has done much in relation\r\nto the \"central lakes\" of New York State; and one very interesting\r\npaper of this kind on The Development of the Ohio River was read\r\nbefore the section by Prof. William G. Light, of Granville, Ohio,\r\nbesides many papers by others on similar topics.\r\n\r\nThe work done within a few years upon the glaciers of Arctic America\r\nhas proved peculiarly fruitful in results. Here, again, the whole\r\nsubject is reviewed historically, and the name and work of each\r\nobserver are impartially noted. Much of the difficulty encountered by\r\nthe glacial theory arose, as we have seen, from the fact that only\r\nmountain glaciers had been studied, so that many of the phenomena\r\nproduced by continental ice could not be explained. Professor\r\nFairchild says, as to this aspect: \"More has been learned of the\r\nstructure, behavior, and work of our ancient ice sheets by the study\r\nof the Alaskan glaciers during the last ten years, and especially by\r\nthe study of the Greenland ice cap during the last four years, than by\r\nall the study of the Alpine glaciers for the seventy years since they\r\nhave been observed.\" Prominent among those who have worked in this\r\nfield are the names of Professors Chamberlain and Salisbury in\r\nGreenland, and Professors H. F. Reid and I. C. Russell in Alaska;\r\nother important contributors are Prof. W. P. Blake, the pioneer\r\ngeologist in Alaska, 1867; Dall and Baker, who discovered and named\r\nthe Malaspina Glacier in 1874; and John Muir, 1878, for whom the Muir\r\nGlacier was named; Wright, Baldwin, Schwatka, Libbey, and others, and\r\nBarton and Tarr in Greenland.\r\n\r\nProfessor Russell, in 1891, recognized and named a type of glacier\r\nthat was before unknown. In his studies on the Malaspina he found a\r\ncondition that does not occur, so far as yet observed, anywhere else\r\nthan on the northwest coast of America; this is where a number of\r\nmountain glaciers debouch upon a low, flat coast plain, and unite to\r\nform a great sluggishly moving sheet of ice. This particular\r\ndevelopment he called the Piedmont type.\r\n\r\nIn closing his address, Professor Fairchild remarks that the word\r\n\"theory,\" as applied to the glacial origin of the drift and its\r\nphenomena, may and should now be abandoned. The subject has passed\r\nbeyond the stage of theory, and is as well understood and as clearly\r\nestablished as the volcanic origin of the cone of Vesuvius or the\r\nsedimentary origin of stratified rocks.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     In the center of the artificial platforms or platform\r\n     mounds, characteristic of many of the ancient Peruvian\r\n     towns, Mr. Bandelier has observed features that recall\r\n     forcibly the New Mexican Indian custom of giving to each\r\n     inanimate object its heart. In some instances, says Mr. F.\r\n     W. Hodge, in his paper, round columns formed a kind of an\r\n     interior niche; in others, a small chamber contained urns or\r\n     jars with maize meal. A remarkable and very significant\r\n     feature was observed by the explorer in a partly ruined\r\n     mound at Chanchan. The core of this structure when opened\r\n     showed two well-preserved altars of adobe. In such interior\r\n     apartments, figurines of metal, clay, or wood are almost\r\n     invariably found; and the materially valuable finds made in\r\n     Peruvian ruins in earlier times came from the \"heart\" of one\r\n     or the other of the artificial elevations described.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMODERN STUDIES OF EARTHQUAKES.\r\n\r\nBY GEORG GERALAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe investigation of earthquakes, seismology, has become in the\r\npresent day an independent subject of scientific interest. In lands\r\nwhere earthquakes are frequent, as in Italy and Japan, seismic\r\nobservations have been officially systematized over the whole country,\r\nwith central and branch stations at which the work is never still. A\r\nnet of seismic observations of all nations is being more and more\r\nclosely woven over the whole earth, and there are yearly and monthly\r\ncollations of observations of even the slightest shocks. Seismic\r\nliterature is, therefore, nearly inexhaustible, and theory and praxis\r\nare in constant vogue; in short, seismics has grown to be a separate\r\nbranch of science, and to demand independent treatment, calling for\r\nthe energy and labor of many students. What gives it so great\r\nimportance? What is the condition of our present knowledge and its\r\nhistory? What will be reached in the future through the competition of\r\nthe nations? These questions possess a high scientific as well as\r\nculture-historical interest. We here attempt to answer them.\r\n\r\nThe first really scientific description of an earthquake--that of\r\nLisbon--with its far-reaching accompanying phenomena, was the work of\r\nthe greatest contemporary thinker, Kant, and it is not too much to say\r\nthat his paper opened a new epoch in the knowledge of earthquakes.\r\nThat terrible event and the extreme terror which it caused everywhere\r\nwere followed in 1783 by the likewise extremely destructive earthquake\r\nof Calabria. The attention of the people was thus directed to this\r\nmysterious mighty activity of the earth, and was kept especially\r\nlively in Italy, the country of Europe most subject to earthquakes.\r\nThe newly rising science of geology therefore found in the last third\r\nof the last century in these phenomena a problem of prominent\r\nimportance. Geologists were the first to apply themselves to seismic\r\nstudies, as the most widely current explanation of the phenomena is\r\nstill a geological one. The scientific interest of the question\r\nprevailed over the practical. More attentive observation was given to\r\nearthquakes, the accounts of them scattered through the ancient\r\nchronicles were collated, and the already very numerous seismic notes\r\nof great earthquake manifestations--such as those by Hoff, Perry,\r\nMallet, Volger, Fuchs, etc.--constituted a very important factor in\r\nthe study. One of the earliest results of the inquiry was to show that\r\ndirectly perceptible earthquakes are not perceptible everywhere; that\r\nthey are most common on the great upfoldings of the earth's crust on\r\nthe mountain chains, such as the Andes, Alps, and Himalayas; and that,\r\nfurther, they are connected with the shores of the Pacific, the\r\nAntilles, and the Mediterranean, and with places also where great\r\nbreaches and various disturbances are evident; that they are at home\r\nlikewise in volcanoes; and that they are most frequent in the northern\r\nhemisphere, and when the earth is nearest to the sun. The descriptions\r\nof powerful shocks furnish us evidence of a double movement of the\r\nearth's crust--an alternate up-and-down vibration and an often very\r\nmarked wave motion. The destruction which earthquake shocks and waves\r\ninflict on buildings, and the remarkably rapid and wide spread of the\r\ntremblings over the surface of the earth, have been very diligently\r\ninquired into; and when, in 1856, Naples and Calabria were visited by\r\na great earthquake, an English investigator, Robert Mallet, made a\r\nfull study of it, and believed that by comparing the direction of the\r\nrents in walls and buildings, which were assumed to correspond with\r\nthat of the tremblings, he could identify the focus of the shocks in\r\nthe earth's interior, and the course of the wave movement over its\r\nsurface--a view which has long prevailed in seismology. Still more\r\nimportant was the work of the geologist Karl von Seebach, of\r\nGöttingen, on the great earthquake in central Germany, which kept the\r\nnorthern part of the plains of the upper Rhine, around Mayence,\r\nGrossgerau, and Darmstadt, disturbed for several years after 1869. Von\r\nSeebach's chief effort was to obtain the most exact data possible as\r\nto the time of the beginning of the shocks from as many places as\r\npossible, from which he might deduce the spot where the shocks began\r\nand were strongest, the epicenter which lay directly over the point in\r\nthe earth's interior where the movement originated. From them he also\r\ndeduced a series of localities where the shocks were simultaneous and\r\nof equal intensity, which could be connected by certain nearly\r\ncircular lines called _homoseists_. As the distance of these from the\r\nepicenter increases, the undulations take place later and are weaker,\r\nand facts may be thus furnished from the velocity of propagation of\r\nthe shocks can be computed. The observations are also important\r\nbecause von Seebach undertook through a simple mathematical\r\ncalculation to determine from them the situation of the forces of the\r\nsubterranean point where the undulations originated.\r\n\r\nWith these investigations, the process of annihilating time and space\r\nby steam and the applications of electricity was also going on. By the\r\neffect of this great event, the conditions of earthquake investigation\r\nwere revolutionized. A comparative study of the phenomena, fundamental\r\nand essential to a science of seismology, on the basis of material\r\nfurnished from all the regions of the earth, was rendered possible. An\r\nearthquake service was organized in Japan, by J. Milne, of England;\r\none had already been organized for a considerable time in Italy, and\r\nthe results obtained at the two places of observation so widely\r\nseparated corresponded. Japanese, Indian, and American earthquakes\r\ncould be simultaneously studied in Italy, Russia, Germany, and\r\nEngland; and thus a new, hitherto undeveloped field was gained, the\r\nscope of which has already extended far beyond its merely geological\r\naspect.\r\n\r\nThis could have happened only through another advance that has been\r\nmade in our century, which has first rendered a real seismology, a\r\nscientific knowledge of the seismic conditions of the earth, possible\r\nthrough the immense development of technics, by which a system of\r\ninstrumental observation of earthquakes was established. Only through\r\nthis could the acquisitions of recent times be utilized. While\r\nformerly observations were macroscopic and touched only earthquakes\r\nthat could be directly felt, they now cover essentially microscopic\r\ntremors of the earth's crust, of less than a thousandth of a\r\nmillimetre, that are wholly imperceptible to human senses; and we can\r\nread them, enlarged at our pleasure, on our photographically\r\nregistering seismometers. We already had instruments which correctly\r\nindicated the time of the beginning and possibly the direction of a\r\nshock; but we needed and have invented new instruments--various sorts\r\nof horizontal and vertical pendulums--for the observation and\r\nrepresentation of the whole course of the movement. The vertical\r\nindicating instruments are much used in Italy, and the horizontal ones\r\nalmost exclusively in England, Japan, and Germany. The horizontal\r\npendulum was invented in Germany in 1832 by Hengler, adapted to\r\nscientific use by Professor Zöllner, of Leipsic, and afterward applied\r\nin that form by English, German, and other observers. The most\r\ncomplete shape and the one best adapted to extremely delicate seismic\r\nobservations was given to it by the late German astronomer and\r\ngeographer Dr. Ernst von Rebeur Paschnitz, of Merseburg. Having\r\nundergone a few small changes, fixed in a threefold combination it\r\nserves as our most sensitive and accurate seismometer. Its movements\r\nand its very exact time markings are photographically represented. The\r\npendulum box is only forty centimetres in diameter. In consequence of\r\nits convenience and cheapness, its self-action and its serviceability,\r\nit is becoming adopted more and more generally as an international\r\ninstrument.\r\n\r\nMicroseismic investigation and its wide extension over the earth have\r\nraised seismology another step during the last twenty years, so that\r\nit may be said that really exact seismic research began with it.\r\nModern seismology has confirmed many of the older results, such as the\r\nlocalization of earthquakes on the shores of the Pacific, the\r\nMediterranean and in the mountain chains of the earth, and also the\r\nimportance of homoseists and the epicenter. It has, on the other hand,\r\ngreatly modified the former estimates of the velocity of propagation\r\nof the shocks. It has cast much doubt on speculations as to the\r\nseasons in which earthquakes are more or less frequent; and it has\r\ndemonstrated the inadequacy of former methods of determining the\r\ncentral focus. It has furthermore brought us much that is new. First\r\nis the momentous fact that the earth's crust is never at rest; that it\r\nundergoes a multitude of very diversified movements besides those of\r\nthe earthquake. Thus a periodical swelling, a flood wave, is produced\r\nby the attraction of the moon; and other heavings are induced by the\r\ndaily and annual course of the sun's heat. But such movements and\r\nother similar ones do not come within the scope of this article.\r\n\r\nReal earthquakes, or movements that originate in the depths of the\r\nearth, also appear in very different forms. First are the directly\r\nperceptible shocks, from the powerful ones that create great\r\ndisturbances to the merely local ones often hardly remarked. Of the\r\nimmediate workings of these shocks, microscopic instruments have\r\ntaught us nothing essentially new. But very many macroscopic\r\nmovements, often continuing for several hours, but which are not felt,\r\nhave been revealed, that have been shown in many instances to be\r\ndistant effects of other strong earthquakes; effects which are\r\nsometimes propagated over the whole surface of the earth. There is,\r\nfurthermore, another series of movements, only partly explained as\r\nyet, of a peculiar sort: first, small, quickly passing disturbances,\r\nwhich appear in the photographic reproductions of the curves as larger\r\nor smaller knots, and which are regarded with great probability as\r\ndistant effects of minor seismic movements most likely imperceptible\r\nanywhere. They can not be local earthquakes, for they give entirely\r\ndifferent curves. There also appear, with considerable regularity, at\r\ncertain seasons of the year, very slow movements of the ground, called\r\npulsations; and finally the multitude of vibrations called tremors,\r\nwhich assume various forms. Sometimes they come as forerunners,\r\naccompaniments, or followers in close association with those great\r\ndisturbances that originate in distant earthquakes; sometimes as\r\nshocks of minute intensity in separate groups, which it has not yet\r\nbeen possible to account for; and in other cases they are traced to\r\nthe shaking of the ground by the wind. It is hardly necessary to\r\nobserve that the seismic apparatus should be most carefully guarded\r\nagainst disturbance by the movements of trade, wagons, etc., so that\r\nthe problem shall not be complicated by them.\r\n\r\nThe theory of the nature of earthquake shocks, their transmission and\r\ntheir velocity, has been set in a new light by the labors of Augustus\r\nSmith, of Stuttgart. From some calculations of their velocity made by\r\nG. von Nebeur, it is found that the earthquake of April 17, 1889, in\r\nTokio, Japan, was perceived in Potsdam, Prussia, nine thousand\r\nkilometres distant, in thirteen minutes; that of October 27, 1894, in\r\nSantiago, Chili, in Rome, eleven thousand five hundred kilometres\r\ndistant, in seventeen minutes, and in Charkow, Russia, two thousand\r\nkilometres from Rome, between one and two minutes later. It reached\r\nTokio at the same time, after a transit of seventeen thousand four\r\nhundred kilometres.\r\n\r\nStill another task of modern seismology is the investigation of\r\nearthquakes at sea, or seismic movements of the bottom of the ocean,\r\nand the manner in which they are propagated through the water, of\r\nwhich a very fine cartographic representation has been published by\r\nDr. C. Rudolph, of Strasburg.\r\n\r\nThe question of the origin of earthquakes stands in constant\r\nconnection with this external development of seismology. It is\r\nsignificant and remarkable that the answers to it, though they may be\r\ngiven differently from different scientific points of view, are always\r\nconsistent in one fact, that earthquakes are a phenomenon of the whole\r\nearth. Some of the investigators seek to explain them, aside from\r\nthose that occur in volcanic regions, as a part of the great changes\r\nin the earth's crust which have taken place during the last geological\r\nepoch, and are still, perhaps, taking place; others find their seat\r\nand cause in the unstable condition of the interior of the earth,\r\nbeneath its solid and red-hot envelope. The former explanation, the\r\nolder and heretofore the prevalent one, is called the tectonic theory,\r\nbecause it is based, leaving out volcanic earthquakes, on the\r\nstructure of the earth's crust; the second, which is gaining ground,\r\nand requires no separate explanation for volcanic earthquakes, may be\r\ncalled, reviving an expression used by L. Fr. Naumann, of Leipsic, the\r\nPlutonic theory, because it goes down into the unexplored depths of\r\nthe earth. If seismic manifestations depend upon the action of the\r\nwhole earth, a single explanatory principle, as is always the case\r\nwith great natural phenomena, is not sufficient, and tectonic as well\r\nas Plutonic earthquakes must be recognized, and the reverse.\r\n\r\nThe tectonic theory is of geological origin, and properly supplanted\r\nthe older Plutonic theory of Humboldt, which was only an unverified\r\nsupposition. As a whole it was first worked out by Otto Volger in\r\n1858, after various similar hypotheses had been set forth by other\r\ninvestigators. He was confirmed by the independent researches of\r\nRudolf Hoernes, Edouard Suess, and most of the German, French, and\r\nEnglish seismologists.\r\n\r\nTheir theory supposes that there are large hollow spaces in the crust\r\nof the earth, into which immense falls of material take place, and\r\nthat these are the cause of a part of the earthquakes; that the crust\r\nof the earth is often and variously disturbed in consequence of the\r\nconstant contraction dependent upon the cooling of the globe. It is\r\nbroken up into separate masses which in their turn are dislocated\r\nhorizontally or vertically; is lifted up and folded into immense\r\nmountain ranges, the arches of which, breaking, may again suffer\r\ndislocation. Thus continuous action in movement of masses and foldings\r\nis constantly going on in the earth. Edouard Suess, the distinguished\r\nAustrian geologist, has indeed constituted a special earthquake type\r\nto correspond with this type of mountain formation. Since, in\r\nconsequence of this condition, tension is present everywhere in the\r\ncrust of the earth, it may come to pass that it shall be relieved by a\r\ndistant earthquake, and another earthquake, which may be called a\r\nrelay or transmission earthquake, be produced thereby. Hence we have,\r\nbesides the volcanic, the landfall, the tectonic (in the strict\r\nsense), and the transmission earthquakes. The sources of earthquake\r\nforce lie, then, according to this theory, in the incompleteness of\r\nthe earth's crust, the effects of gravity, and the earth's loss of\r\nheat.\r\n\r\nAnd is the supposition not very probable? Do we not see similar\r\nprocesses going on over the whole earth, in the shape of earthquakes,\r\nlandslides, fissures, subsidences of land, and the like? And as the\r\nAlps were lifted up, and the plain of the Rhine was depressed between\r\nthe Vosges and the Black Forest, may not mightier dislocations,\r\nbreaches, and destruction occur? Why may not the processes which took\r\nplace in the earlier epochs of the earth's history and were so\r\npowerful in the more recent Tertiary be still going on? All this seems\r\nso plausible that, with a few exceptions, the theory has been almost\r\nuniversally agreed in.\r\n\r\nI briefly mention here Falb's theory, which, accepting the earlier\r\nviews, ascribes earthquakes to periodical swellings of the fiery fluid\r\ninterior of the earth, only because of the effect it has had on the\r\npublic in connection with some wholly unscientific predictions. More\r\nworthy of consideration is the theory of Daubrée, the late\r\ndistinguished master of French and especially Alsatian geology, who\r\ndid not attribute the similar phenomena of volcanic and nonvolcanic\r\nearthquakes to different causes, but maintained that all earthquakes\r\nwere produced by superheated steam issuing from surface waters. But\r\nthis theory needs no refutation. There are, however, some serious\r\nobjections to the tectonic theory of earthquakes, plausible as it may\r\nseem. In order to weigh them as we ought, we must as briefly as\r\npossible construct a picture of the constitution of the earth's\r\ninterior.\r\n\r\nThe average distance from the earth's surface to its center is\r\nsixty-three hundred and seventy kilometres. The temperature of the\r\nearth increases with the depth, at the rate, on a moderate estimate,\r\nof about one degree centigrade for every forty metres. Hence, at a\r\ndepth of one thousand kilometres we would have a temperature of\r\n25,000° C.; even if we call it only 15,000°, we should expect to find\r\nthere only gases, and those in a simple state, for with that heat all\r\nthe compound gases would be dissociated. The zone of fluidity for all\r\nrocks lies at a depth of about one hundred kilometres, where the\r\ntemperature is 2,500° C. While the crust of the earth is between 2.5\r\nand three times as heavy as distilled water at 4° C., its specific\r\ngravity rises toward the center of the earth to more than eleven, or\r\nabout fourfold. Iron has a specific gravity of 7.8, or about threefold\r\nthat of the crust of the earth; but the specific gravity of the earth\r\nat the greatest depth is considerably higher than this. Hence must\r\narise an enormous pressure, steadily increasing toward the center,\r\nwhere, according to the English geophysicist, the Rev. Osmond Fisher,\r\nit reaches about three million atmospheres to the English square inch.\r\nIt results from these conditions that with the enormous pressure and\r\nheat, and specific gravity, the interior of the earth consists of\r\ndissociated gases compressed to great rigidity, which exert an immense\r\ncounter-pressure--for their tendency is always to expand. They pass\r\nout continuously into a zone of fluid matter, and this again is held\r\nby the pressure of the interior gases in a like compact condition.\r\nThus a very high pressure still prevails in the lower parts of the\r\nsolid crust of the earth, which is so high that even the most solid\r\nrocks there are in a latent plastic condition--that is, they behave\r\ntoward different forces like plastic clay, and like it can be deformed\r\nwithout breaking. Rents, slides, caves, and clefts are out of the\r\nquestion there; things of that kind can exist only in the upper\r\nstrata.\r\n\r\nThis fact constitutes a very strong objection to the tectonic theory\r\nof earthquakes, and thus the very depths of the earth speak against\r\nit. We have already mentioned that K. von Seebach estimated the depth\r\nof the earthquake focus from the movements of the waves, and found it\r\nnot very great. But his estimates, as Prof. August Schmidt has shown,\r\nrest upon physically incorrect premises; according to Schmidt's more\r\ncorrect calculation, the center of the Charleston earthquake of 1886\r\nlay at a depth of one hundred and twenty kilometres, where there can\r\nbe no question of tectonic movements, because general fluidity is\r\nreached at one hundred kilometres. Further, the earthquake at Lisbon,\r\nif the tectonic theory is valid, might, taking the character of the\r\nregion into consideration, have been occasioned by a slide. But how\r\nlarge must the plunging mass, how deep the plunge or slide have been\r\nto produce such shocks as destroyed Lisbon and shook Europe to beyond\r\nBohemia! Where can we find room in the closely compressed interior of\r\nthe earth for such irruptions? Even if such a sudden sinking had left\r\nno trace in the interior, it should have left its marks on the\r\nsurface. Mr. John Milne counts up not less than 8,331 considerable\r\nearthquake shocks in Japan between 1885 and 1892; Julius Schmidt,\r\nformer director of the observatory in Athens, enumerated three hundred\r\nsevere and dangerous and fifty thousand light shocks for Phocis alone\r\nbetween 1870 and 1873, of which not a trace of land changes or\r\ndepressions can be perceived, aside from superficial avalanches (on\r\nParnassus, for example) and subsidence of meadows and other spongy\r\nsoil, like the famous depression of the Molo at Lisbon.\r\n\r\nAll this speaks so emphatically against the tectonic origin of\r\nearthquakes that it can not be considered as a general cause. Even the\r\nmighty disturbances and shocks of the times when such ranges as the\r\nAlps and Himalayas were lifted up can prove nothing for the present\r\ntime; for the conditions, the mechanical work and acting forces, of\r\nthe earth were quite different, and the latter much greater and more\r\nacute than in our time, as the number and magnitude of the volcanoes\r\nof those ages show, before which ours are almost as nothing. We have\r\nno adequate comprehension of the way that mechanical work was done. A\r\ndepression like that of the plain of the Rhine could certainly not\r\nhave taken place without severe earthquakes; but we do not know how\r\nthey may have come to pass, for we have nothing analogous to them. The\r\nupper strata of the earth's crust are broken up, fissured, and\r\ncavernous; hence purely local minor earthquakes may undoubtedly be\r\nproduced by cavings-in, landslides, and settlings of small extent. But\r\nthis explanation, in view of the nature of the crust, is not possible\r\nfor strong earthquakes, even in the upper layers, which send their\r\nwaves far over the land; their origin must be, almost of necessity, in\r\nthe greater deeps beneath the crust, far down where the immense gas\r\nglobe of the interior is constantly forcing its way into the fluid\r\nband, and this into the solid stone; in those zones of changing\r\nconditions a mighty movement must be incessantly prevailing. The\r\npressure upon the gases of the interior diminishes here, and the\r\nexcessive temperature as well. This can not take place without\r\nchanges. Temperature and pressure now fall, now rise again, but\r\ncontinue very high through it all. The dissociated gases unite and\r\nseparate again, and most violent explosions are infallibly produced\r\nthereby. Water exists in the interior in immense masses, and that not\r\nsolely in consequence of percolation from the surface. Vapor at very\r\nhigh pressure separates into its elements--hydrogen and oxygen--the\r\nreunion of which ensues with violent explosions, similar to our gas\r\nexplosions, which must be very numerous in the interior of the earth,\r\nand accompanied with great development of force. The principal effect\r\nof such explosions is, of course, against the cooler and more weakly\r\nresisting sides, and therefore not toward the interior but toward the\r\ncrust and the weakest parts of it, toward the rupture lines of the\r\nzones of disturbance, the synclinals. Such attacks, striking the\r\nearth's crust from within, occasion most earthquakes, especially\r\nviolent, destructive, deep-seated outbursts like those of Lisbon and\r\nCharleston. The relation of the seismic and the volcanic phenomena is\r\nclearly to be seen.\r\n\r\nOne series of seismic phenomena remains to be explained--the lighter\r\nundulations, the tremors, and the remarkable irregularity of the\r\nmovements of the ground. The indications of the vertical pendulum\r\napparatus which represent these movements form an inextricable tangle\r\nof lines running over and crossing one another. The late Japanese\r\nprofessor of seismology, Sekiya, prepared an enlarged model of the\r\ntracings of the seismic movements of a point of the earth's surface,\r\nwhich has been much copied. It represents an extremely confusing\r\nvibration of the lines.\r\n\r\nNow we have to confront a very important fact which adds much to the\r\ndifficulty of seismic research. We never feel and observe the\r\nearthquake shocks themselves, never directly in their simplicity or\r\nmultiplicity, but only the wave movements that are sent out from them\r\nin the elastic crust of the earth. These, however multifold their\r\norigin, proceed in an immense spherical wave which moves in more or\r\nless numerous repetitions through the earth's interior. It is this\r\nshaking of the earth by the spherical waves that our instruments\r\nrepresent as earthquakes. We can not include as the earth's crust the\r\nsurface of the earth on which we live, and which consists of loose\r\nmaterials disintegrated by weathering, breaking, and numerous causes,\r\nbut the solid crust, often lying at a considerable distance beneath\r\nus, which bears these materials, and from which the spherical waves\r\nemerge. As the waves of the sea, beating upon the coast, are turned,\r\nsplit up, divided, thrown up, etc., in their surging, so surge, too,\r\nthe seismic waves upon the disintegrated surface of shingle, pebbles,\r\nbroken rocks, sand, and earth, in clefts and gorges. We thus never\r\nobserve the original spherical waves, but only their fragmentary\r\nderivative forms, their resolution into numerous single waves which\r\ncome to us diverted into the most various directions. It is thus most\r\nplainly shown that Mallet's effort to determine the center and origin\r\nof the earthquake from the direction of the shock was futile. We can\r\nonly draw scientific conclusions respecting the time of beginning, the\r\nduration, and force of the movement. It is thus evident that many of\r\nthe tremors (not all, by any means) originate in this division; that a\r\nfixed point of the earth's surface must describe a very complicated\r\npath in so intricate a wave movement; that the division is less marked\r\non firm ground than on loose; that the former, in consequence of the\r\nmore evenly protracted movement, is less dangerous than the latter;\r\nand that multiplied waves interfere, overlay, weaken, or strengthen\r\none another just as water waves do. Thus are explained the earthquake\r\nbridges or spots which always remain unmoved through repeated\r\nearthquakes, either because they are firmer, or because the progress\r\nof the waves is arrested at them by interference.\r\n\r\nThe sounds, too, which so frequently accompany earthquakes are\r\nlikewise simply results of this division of the waves and their escape\r\ninto the air, for we perceive wave motions in the air as sound. The\r\nadmirable delicacy of our sense of hearing is here manifested, for\r\nseismic movements are not rarely perceptible, or heard, as air waves,\r\nwhich we can not perceive as movements of the ground. Earthquake\r\nthunder is caused, like storm thunder, by shocks to the air, of which\r\nwe hear the nearest and latest first, and the farthest and earliest\r\nlast. The different tone shades of the earthquake sound depend upon\r\ntheir various sources, as from small, sharp fragments, clinking,\r\nrattling, and humming; from sand and earth, dull rumbling; from trees,\r\nwhistling, etc. The echo in ravines not rarely operates to add\r\nstrength to them. Earthquake sounds that seem to come out of the air\r\nfrom above are caused by earthquake waves reaching us by way of trees,\r\nhouses, etc.; the different directions and degrees of force which they\r\nseem to indicate in different houses or in different rooms of the same\r\nhouse are explainable by the different elasticity conditions of the\r\nhouses and rooms. But not the most insignificant conclusion can be\r\ndrawn from these sounds concerning the nature and causes of\r\nearthquakes. It is important to emphasize this fact, for errors have\r\noften originated in conclusions drawn from such things.--_Translated\r\nfor the Popular Science Monthly from the Deutsche Rundschau._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     Examples of a race of curiously protectively colored mice\r\n     which inhabit the sandy island, the North Bull, in the Bay\r\n     of Dublin, were exhibited by Dr. H. Lyster Jameson in the\r\n     Zoölogical Section of the British Association. A\r\n     considerable percentage of them were distinctly lighter hued\r\n     than the ancestral type of house mouse, though every\r\n     possible gradation occurred between the typical house mouse\r\n     and the palest examples. The speaker regarded the marked\r\n     predominance of sand-colored specimens as due to the action\r\n     of natural selection. The hawks and owls which frequent the\r\n     island, and are the only enemies the mice have to compete\r\n     against, most easily capture the darkest examples, or those\r\n     that contrast most strongly with the color of the sand. Thus\r\n     a protectively colored race is becoming established. The\r\n     island came into existence only about a hundred years ago.\r\n     Consequently it is possible to fix a time limit within which\r\n     the sandy-colored race has been evolved. Its evolution also,\r\n     as Professor Poulton observed in his comment on Dr.\r\n     Jameson's paper, gives additional evidence to that afforded\r\n     by the shore crabs described by Professor Weldon in his\r\n     presidential address to the section, that the transmutation\r\n     of species is not necessarily so slow as to be\r\n     indiscernible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA SHORT HISTORY OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUCTION[33]\r\n\r\nBY J. NORMAN LOCKYER, K. C. B., F. R. S.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe two addresses by my colleagues, Professors Judd and\r\nRoberts-Austen, have drawn attention to the general history of our\r\ncollege and the details of one part of our organization. I propose to\r\ndeal with another part, the consideration of which is of very great\r\nimportance at the present time, for we are in one of those educational\r\nmovements which spring up from time to time and mold the progress of\r\ncivilization. The question of a teaching university in the largest\r\ncity in the world, secondary education, and so-called technical\r\neducation are now occupying men's minds.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning it is imperative that I should call your attention to\r\nthe fact that the stern necessities of the human race have been the\r\norigin of all branches of science and learning; that all so-called\r\neducational movements have been based upon the actual requirements of\r\nthe time. There has never been an educational movement for learning's\r\nsake; but of course there have always been studies and students apart\r\nfrom any of those general movements to which I am calling attention;\r\nstill we have to come down to the times of Louis Quatorze before the\r\nstudy of the useless, the _même inutile_, was recognized as a matter\r\nof national concern.\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps the more necessary to insist upon stern necessity as\r\nbeing the origin of learning, because it is so difficult for us now to\r\nput ourselves in the place of those early representatives of our race\r\nthat had to face the problems of life among conditionings of which\r\nthey were profoundly ignorant: when night meant death; when there was\r\nno certainty that the sun would rise on the morrow; when the growth of\r\na plant from seed was unrecognized; when a yearly return of seasons\r\nmight as well be a miracle as a proof of a settled order of phenomena;\r\nwhen, finally, neither cause nor effect had been traced in the\r\noperations of Nature.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtless in consequence of this difficulty that some of the\r\nearly races have been credited by some authors with a special love of\r\nabstract science, of science for its own sake; so that this, and not\r\nstern necessity, was the motive of their inquiries. Thus we have been\r\ntold that the Chaldeans differed from the other early races in having\r\na predilection for astronomy, another determining factor being that\r\nthe vast plains in that country provided them with a perfect horizon.\r\n\r\nThe first historic glimpses of the study of astronomy we find among\r\nthe peoples occupying the Nile Valley and Chaldea, say 6000 B. C.\r\n\r\nBut this study had to do with the fixing of the length of the year,\r\nand the determination of those times in it in which the various\r\nagricultural operations had to be performed. These were related\r\nstrictly to the rise of the Nile in one country and of the Euphrates\r\nin the other. All human activity was, in fact, tied up with the\r\nmovements of the sun, moon, and stars. These, then, became the gods of\r\nthose early peoples, and the astronomers, the seers, were the first\r\npriests; revered by the people because as interpreters of the\r\ncelestial powers they were the custodians of the knowledge which was\r\nthe most necessary for the purposes of life.\r\n\r\nEudemus of Rhodes, one of the principal pupils of Aristotle, in his\r\nHistory of Geometry, attributes the origin of geometry to the\r\nEgyptians, \"who were obliged to invent it in order to restore the\r\nlandmarks which had been destroyed by the inundation of the Nile,\" and\r\nobserves \"that it is by no means strange that the invention of the\r\nsciences should have originated in practical needs.\"[34] The new\r\ngeometry was brought from Egypt to Greece by Thales three hundred\r\nyears before Aristotle was born.\r\n\r\nWhen to astronomy and geometry we add the elements of medicine and\r\nsurgery, which it is known were familiar to the ancient Egyptians, it\r\nwill be conceded that we are, in those early times, face to face with\r\nthe cultivation of the most useful branches of science.\r\n\r\nNow, although the evidence is increasing day by day that Greek science\r\nwas Egyptian in its origin, there is no doubt that its cultivation in\r\nGreece was more extended, and that it was largely developed there. One\r\nof the most useful and prolific writers on philosophy and science who\r\nhas ever lived, Aristotle, was born in the fourth century B. C. From\r\nhim, it may be said, dates a general conception of science based on\r\n_observation_ as differing from experiment. If you wish to get an idea\r\nof the science of those times, read his writings on Physics and on the\r\nClassification of Animals. All sought in Aristotle the basis of\r\nknowledge, but they only read his philosophy; Dante calls him the\r\n\"master of those who know.\"[35]\r\n\r\nWhy was Aristotle so careful to treat science as well as philosophy,\r\nwith which his master, Plato, had dealt almost exclusively?\r\n\r\nThe answer to this question is of great interest to our present\r\nsubject. The late Lord Playfair[36] in a pregnant passage suggests the\r\nreason, and the later history of Europe shows, I think, that he is\r\nright.\r\n\r\n\"We find that just as early nations became rich and prosperous, so\r\ndid philosophy arise among them, and it declined with the decadence of\r\nmaterial prosperity. In those splendid days of Greece when Plato,\r\nAristotle, and Zeno were the representatives of great schools of\r\nthought, which still exercise their influence on mankind, _Greece was\r\na great manufacturing and mercantile community_; Corinth was the seat\r\nof the manufacture of hardware; Athens that of jewelry, shipbuilding,\r\nand pottery. The rich men of Greece and all its free citizens were\r\nactively engaged in trade and commerce. The learned class were the\r\nsons of those citizens, and were in possession of their accumulated\r\nexperience derived through industry and foreign relations. Thales was\r\nan oil merchant; Aristotle inherited wealth from his father, who was a\r\nphysician, but, spending it, is believed to have supported himself as\r\na druggist till Philip appointed him tutor to Alexander. Plato's\r\nwealth was largely derived from commerce, and his master, Socrates, is\r\nsaid to have been a sculptor. Zeno, too, was a traveling merchant.\r\nArchimedes is perhaps an exception, for he is said to have been\r\nclosely related to a prince; but if so, he is the only princely\r\ndiscoverer of science on record.\"\r\n\r\nIn ancient Greece we see the flood of the first great intellectual\r\ntide. Alas! it never touched the shores of western Europe, but it\r\nundoubtedly reached to Rome, and there must have been very much more\r\nobservational science taught in the Roman studia than we generally\r\nimagine, otherwise how account for Pliny, the vast public works, their\r\ncivilizing influence carried over sea and land from beyond\r\nBab-el-Mandeb to Scotland? In some directions their applications of\r\nscience are as yet unsurpassed.\r\n\r\nWith the fall of the Roman Empire both science and philosophy\r\ndisappeared for a while. The first wave had come and gone; its last\r\nfeebler ripples seem to have been represented at this time by the\r\ngradual change of the Roman secular studia wherever they existed into\r\nclerical schools, the more important of which were in time attached to\r\nthe chief cathedrals and monasteries; and it is not difficult to\r\nunderstand why the secular (or scientific) instruction was gradually\r\nreplaced by one more fitted for the training of priests.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be wondered at that the ceaseless strife in the center of\r\nEurope had driven what little learning there was to the western and\r\nsouthern extremities, where the turmoil was less--I refer to Britain\r\nand South Italy--while the exiled Nestorians carried Hellenic science\r\nand philosophy out of Europe altogether to Mesopotamia and Arabia.\r\n\r\nThe next wave--it was but a small one--had its origin in our own\r\ncountry. In the eighth century England was at its greatest height,\r\nrelatively, in educational matters, chiefly owing to the labors of two\r\nmen. Beda, generally called the Venerable Bede, the most eminent\r\nwriter of his age, was born near Monkwearmouth in 673, and passed his\r\nlife in the monastery there. He not only wrote the history of our\r\nisland and nation, but treatises on the nature of things, astronomy,\r\nchronology, arithmetic, medicine, philosophy, grammar, rhetoric,\r\npoetry, music, basing his work on that of Pliny. He died in 735, in\r\nwhich year his great follower was born in Yorkshire. I refer to\r\nAlcuin. He was educated at the Cathedral School at York under\r\nArchbishop Egbert, and, having imbibed everything he could learn from\r\nthe writings of Bede and others, was soon recognized as one of the\r\ngreatest scholars of the time. On returning from Rome, whither he had\r\nbeen sent by Eaubald to receive the pallium, he met Karl the Great,\r\nKing of the Franks and Lombards, who eventually induced him to take up\r\nhis residence at his court, to become his instructor in the sciences.\r\nKarl (or Charlemagne) then was the greatest figure in the world, and\r\nalthough as King of the Franks and Lombards, and subsequently Emperor\r\nof the Holy Roman Empire, his court was generally at Aachen, he was\r\nconstantly traveling throughout his dominions. He was induced, in\r\nconsequence of Alcuin's influence, not only to have a school always\r\nabout him on his journeys, but to establish, or foster, such schools\r\nwherever he went. Hence it has been affirmed that \"France is indebted\r\nto Alcuin for all the polite learning it boasted of in that and the\r\nfollowing ages.\" The universities of Paris, Tours, Fulden, Soissons,\r\nand others were not actually founded in his day, but the monastic and\r\ncathedral schools out of which they eventually sprang were\r\nstrengthened, and indeed a considerable scheme of education for\r\npriests was established--that is, an education free from all sciences,\r\nand in which philosophy alone was considered.\r\n\r\nKarl the Great died in 814, and after his death the eastward traveling\r\nwave, thus started by Bede and Alcuin, slightly but very gradually\r\nincreased in height. Two centuries later, however, the conditions were\r\nchanged. We find ourselves in presence of interference phenomena, for\r\nthen there was a meeting with another wave traveling westward, and\r\nthis meeting was the origin of the European universities. The wave now\r\nmanifested traveling westerly, spread outward from Arab centers first\r\nand finally from Constantinople, when its vast stores of Greek lore\r\nwere opened by the conquest of the city.\r\n\r\nThe first wavelet justified Eudemus's generalization that \"the\r\ninvention of the sciences originated in practical needs,\" and that\r\nknowledge for its own sake was not the determining factor. The year\r\nhad been determined, stone circles erected almost everywhere, and\r\nfires signaled from them, giving notice of the longest and shortest\r\ndays, so that agriculture was provided for, even away from churches\r\nand the festivals of the Church. The original user of geometry was not\r\nrequired away from the valleys of the Nile, Tigris, and Euphrates, and\r\ntherefore it is now medicine and surgery that come to the front for\r\nthe alleviation of human ills. In the eleventh century we find\r\nSalerno, soon to be famed throughout Europe as the great medical\r\nschool, forming itself into the first university. And medicine did not\r\nexhaust all the science taught, for Adelard listened there to a\r\nlecture on \"the nature of things,\" the cause of magnetic attraction\r\nbeing one of the \"things\" in question.\r\n\r\nThis teaching at Salerno preceded by many years the study of the law\r\nat Bologna and of theology at Paris.\r\n\r\nThe full flood came from the disturbance of the Arab wave center by\r\nthe crusades, about the beginning of the twelfth century. After the\r\nPope had declared the \"Holy War,\" William of Malmesbury tells us \"the\r\nmost distant islands and savage countries were inspired with this\r\nardent passion. The Welshman left his hunting, the Scotchman his\r\nfellowship with vermin, the Dane his drinking party, the Norwegian his\r\nraw fish.\" Report has it that in 1096 no less than six millions were\r\nin motion along many roads to Palestine. This, no doubt, is an\r\nexaggeration, but it reflects the excitement of the time, and prepares\r\nus for what happened when the crusaders returned. As Green puts\r\nit:[37] \"The western nations, including our own, 'were quickened with\r\na new life and throbbing with a new energy.' ... A new fervor of study\r\nsprang up in the West from its contact with the more cultured East.\r\nTravelers like Adelard, of Bath, brought back the first rudiments of\r\nphysical and mathematical science from the schools of Cordova or\r\nBagdad.... The long mental inactivity of feudal Europe broke up like\r\nice before a summer's sun. Wandering teachers, such as Lanfranc or\r\nAnselm, crossed sea and land to spread the new power of knowledge. The\r\nsame spirit of restlessness, of inquiry, of impatience with the older\r\ntraditions of mankind, either local or intellectual, that drove half\r\nChristendom to the tomb of its Lord, crowded the roads with thousands\r\nof young scholars hurrying to the chosen seats where teachers were\r\ngathered together.\"\r\n\r\n_Studium generale_ was the term first applied to a large educational\r\ncenter where there was a guild of masters, and whither students\r\nflocked from all parts. At the beginning of the thirteenth century the\r\nthree principal studia were Paris, Bologna, and Salerno, where\r\ntheology and arts, law and medicine, and medicine almost by itself,\r\nwere taught respectively; these eventually developed into the first\r\nuniversities.[38]\r\n\r\nEnglish scholars gathered in thousands at Paris round the chairs of\r\nWilliam of Champeaux or Abélard, where they took their place as one of\r\nthe \"nations\" of which the great middle-age university of Paris was\r\ncomposed.\r\n\r\nWe have only to do with the arts faculty of this university. We find\r\nthat the subject-matter of the liberal education of the middle age\r\nthere dealt with varied very little from that taught in the schools of\r\nancient Rome.\r\n\r\nThe so-called \"artiens,\" students of the arts faculty, which was the\r\nglory of the university and the one most numerously attended, studied\r\nthe seven arts of the trivium and quadrivium--that is, grammar,\r\nrhetoric, dialectic and arithmetic, geometry, music, astronomy.[39]\r\n\r\nThis at first looks well for scientific study, but the mathematics\r\ntaught had much to do with magic; arithmetic dealt with epacts, golden\r\nnumbers, and the like. There was no algebra, and no mechanics.\r\nAstronomy dealt with the system of the seven heavens.\r\n\r\nScience, indeed, was the last thing to be considered in the\r\ntheological and legal studia, and it would appear that it was kept\r\nalive more in the medical schools than in the arts faculties.\r\nAristotle's writings on physics, biology, and astronomy were not known\r\ntill about 1230, and then in the shape of Arab-Latin translations.\r\nStill, it must not be forgotten that Dante learned some of his\r\nastronomy, at all events, at Paris.\r\n\r\nOxford was an offshoot of Paris, and therefore a theological studium,\r\nin all probability founded about 1167,[40] and Cambridge came later.\r\n\r\nNot till the Reformation (sixteenth century) do we see any sign of a\r\nnew educational wave, and then we find the two which have had the\r\ngreatest influence upon the history of the world--one of them\r\ndepending upon the Reformation itself, the other depending upon the\r\nbirth of experimental inquiry.\r\n\r\nBefore the Reformation the universities were priestly institutions,\r\nand derived their authority from the Popes.\r\n\r\nThe universities were for the few; the education of the people, except\r\nin the various crafts, was unprovided for.\r\n\r\nThe idea of a general education in secular subjects at the expense of\r\nthe state or of communities is coeval with the Reformation. In\r\nGermany, even before the time of Luther, it was undreamed of, or\r\nrather, perhaps, one should say, the question was decided in the\r\nnegative. In his day, however, his zeal first made itself heard in\r\nfavor of education, as many are now making themselves heard in favor\r\nof a better education, and in 1524 he addressed a letter to the\r\ncouncils of all the towns in Germany, begging them to vote money not\r\nmerely for roads, dikes, guns, and the like, but for schoolmasters, so\r\nthat all children might be taught; and he states his opinion that if\r\nit be the duty of a state to compel the able-bodied to carry arms, it\r\nis _a fortiori_ its duty to compel its subjects to send their children\r\nto school, and to provide schools for those who without such aid would\r\nremain uninstructed.\r\n\r\nHere we have the germ of Germany's position at the present day, not\r\nonly in scientific instruction but in everything which that\r\ninstruction brings with it.\r\n\r\nWith the Reformation this idea spread to France. In 1560 we find the\r\nStates-General of Orleans suggesting to Francis II a \"levée d'une\r\ncontribution sur les bénéfices ecclésiastiques pour raisonablement\r\nstipendier des pédagogues et gens lettrés, en toutes villes et\r\nvillages, pour l'instruction de la pauvre jeunesse du plat pays, et\r\nsoient tenus les pères et mères, à peine d'amende, à envoyer les dits\r\nenfants à l'école, et à ce faire soient contraints par les segnieurs\r\net les juges ordinaires.\"\r\n\r\nTwo years after this suggestion, however, the religious wars broke\r\nout; the material interests of the clerical party had predominated,\r\nthe new spirit was crushed under the iron heel of priestcraft, and the\r\nFrench, in consequence, had to wait for three centuries and a\r\nrevolution before they could get comparatively free.\r\n\r\nIn the universities, or at all events alongside them, we find next the\r\nintroduction not so much yet of science as we now know it, with its\r\nexperimental side, as of the scientific spirit.\r\n\r\nThe history of the Collége de France, founded in 1531 by Francis I, is\r\nof extreme interest. In the fifteenth century the studies were chiefly\r\nliterary, and except in the case of a few minds they were confined\r\nmerely to scholastic subtleties, taught (I have it on the authority of\r\nthe Statistique de l'Enseignement Supérieur) in barbarous Latin. This\r\nwas the result of the teaching of the faculties; but even then,\r\noutside the faculties, which were immutable, a small number of\r\ndistinguished men still occupied themselves in a less rigid way in\r\ninvestigation; but still these studies were chiefly literary. Among\r\nthose men may be mentioned Danès, Postel, Dole, Guillaume Budé,\r\nLefèvre d'Étaples, and others, who edited with notes and commentaries\r\nGreek and Latin authors whom the university scarcely knew by name.\r\nHence the renaissance of the sixteenth century, which gave birth to\r\nthe Collége de France, the function of which, at the commencement, was\r\nto teach those things which were not in the ordinary curriculum of the\r\nfaculties. It was called the Collége des Deux Langues, the languages\r\nbeing Hebrew and Greek. It then became the Collége des Trois Langues,\r\nwhen the king, notwithstanding the opposition of the university,\r\ncreated in 1534 a chair of Latin. There was another objection made by\r\nthe university to the new creation: from the commencement the courses\r\nwere free; and this feeling was not decreased by the fact that around\r\nthe celebrated masters of the Trois Langues a crowd of students was\r\nsoon congregated.\r\n\r\nThe idea in the mind of Francis I in creating this Royal College may\r\nbe gathered from the following edict, dated in 1545: \"François, etc.,\r\nsavoir faisons à tous présents et à venir que Nous, considérant que le\r\nsçavoir des langues, qui est un des dons du Saint-Esprit, fait\r\nouverture et donne le moyen de plus entière connaissance et plus\r\nparfaite intelligence de toutes bonnes, honnêtes, saintes et\r\nsalutaires sciences.... Avons fait faire pleinement entendre à ceux\r\nqui, y voudraient vacquer, les trois langues principales, Hébraïque,\r\nGrecque, et Latine, _et les Livres esquels les bonnes sciences_ sont\r\nle mieux et le plus profondément traitées. A laquelle fin, et en\r\nsuivant le décret du concile de Vienne, nous avons piéça ordonné et\r\nestabli en nôtre bonne ville de Paris, un bonne nombre de personnages\r\nde sçavoir excellent, qui lisent et enseignent publiquement et\r\nordinairement les dites langues et sciences, maintenant\r\nflorissantautant ou plus qu'elles ne firent de bien longtemps ...\r\nauxquels nos lecteurs avons donné honnêtes gages et salaires, et iceux\r\nfait pourvoir de plusieurs beaux bénéfices pour les entretenir et\r\ndonner occasion de mieux et plus continuellement entendre au fait de\r\nleur charge, ... etc.\"\r\n\r\nThe Statistique, which I am following in this account, thus sums up\r\nthe founder's intention: \"Le Collége Royal avait pour mission de\r\npropager les nouvelles connaissances, les nouvelles découvertes. Il\r\nn'enseignait pas la science faite, il la faisait.\"\r\n\r\nIt was on account of this more than on account of anything else that\r\nit found its greatest enemy in the university. The founding of this\r\nnew college, and the great excitement its success occasioned in Paris,\r\nwere, there can be little doubt, among the factors which induced\r\nGresham to found his college in London in 1574.\r\n\r\nThese two institutions played a great part in their time. Gresham\r\nCollege, it is true, was subsequently strangled, but not before its\r\ninfluence had been such as to permit the Royal Society to rise\r\nphoenixlike from its ashes; for it is on record that the first step in\r\nthe forming of this society was taken after a lecture on astronomy by\r\nSir Christopher Wren at the college. All connected with them felt in\r\ntime the stupendous change of thought in the century which saw the\r\nbirth of Bacon, Galileo, Gilbert, Hervey, Tycho Brahe, Descartes, and\r\nmany others that might be named; and of these, it is well to remark,\r\nGilbert,[41] Hervey, and Galileo were educated in medical schools\r\nabroad.\r\n\r\nBacon was not only the first to lay down _regulæ philosophandi_, but\r\nhe insisted upon the far-reaching results of research, not forgetting\r\nto point out that \"_lucifera experimenta, non fructifera\r\nquærenda_,\"[42] as a caution to the investigator, though he had no\r\ndoubt as to the revolution to be brought about by the ultimate\r\napplication of the results of physical inquiry.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1560 the Academia Secretorum Naturæ was founded at Naples,\r\nfollowed by the Lincei in 1609, the Royal Society in 1645, the Cimento\r\nin 1657, and the Paris Academy in 1666.\r\n\r\nFrom that time the world may be said to have belonged to science, now\r\nno longer based merely on observation but on experiment. But, alas!\r\nhow slowly has it percolated into our universities.\r\n\r\nThe first organized endeavor to teach science in schools was naturally\r\nmade in Germany (Prussia), where, in 1747 (nearly a century and a half\r\nago), Realschulen were first started; they were taken over by the\r\nGovernment in 1832, and completely reorganized in 1859, this step\r\nbeing demanded by the growth of industry and the spread of the modern\r\nspirit. Eleven hours a week were given to natural science in these\r\nschools forty years ago.\r\n\r\nTEACHING THE TEACHERS.--Until the year 1762 the Jesuits had the\r\neducation of France almost entirely in their hands, and when,\r\ntherefore, their expulsion was decreed in that year, it was only a\r\nnecessary step to create an institution to teach the future teachers\r\nof France. Here, then, we had the École Normale in theory; but it was\r\na long time before this theory was carried into practice, and very\r\nprobably it would never have been had not Rolland d'Erceville made it\r\nhis duty for more than twenty years, by numerous publications, among\r\nwhich is especially to be mentioned his Plan d'Education, printed in\r\n1783, to point out not merely the utility but the absolute necessity\r\nfor some institution of the kind. As generally happens in such cases,\r\nthis exertion was not lost, for in 1794 it was decreed that an École\r\nNormale should be opened at Paris, \"ou seront appelés de toutes les\r\nparties de la République, des citoyens déjà instruits dans les\r\nsciences utiles, pour apprendre, sous les professeurs les plus habiles\r\ndans tous les genres, l'art d'enseigner.\"\r\n\r\nTo follow these courses in the art of teaching, one potential\r\nschoolmaster was to be sent to Paris by every district containing\r\ntwenty thousand inhabitants. Fourteen or fifteen hundred young men\r\ntherefore arrived in Paris, and in 1795 the courses of the school were\r\nopened first of all in the amphitheater of the Museum of Natural\r\nHistory. The professors were chosen from among the most celebrated men\r\nof France, the sciences being represented by Lagrange, Laplace, Haüry,\r\nMonge, Daubenton, and Berthollet.\r\n\r\nWhile there was this enormous progress abroad, represented especially\r\nby the teaching of science in Germany and the teaching of the teachers\r\nin France, things slumbered and slept in Britain. We had our coal and\r\nour iron, our material capital, and no one troubled about our mental\r\ncapital, least of all the universities, which had become, according to\r\nMatthew Arnold (who was not likely to overstate matters), mere _hauts\r\nlycées_, and \"had lost the very idea of a real university\";[43] and\r\nsince our political leaders generally came from the universities,\r\nlittle more was to be expected from them.\r\n\r\nMany who have attempted to deal with the history of education have\r\nfailed to give sufficient prominence to the tremendous difference\r\nthere must necessarily have been in scientific requirements before and\r\nafter the introduction of steam power.\r\n\r\nIt is to the discredit of our country that we, who gave the perfected\r\nsteam engine, the iron ship, and the locomotive to the world, should\r\nhave been the last to feel the next wave of intellectual progress.\r\n\r\nAll we did at the beginning of the century was to found mechanics'\r\ninstitutions. They knew better in Prussia, \"a bleeding and lacerated\r\nmass\";[44] after Jena (1806), King Frederick William III and his\r\ncouncilors, disciples of Kant, founded the University of Berlin, \"to\r\nsupply the loss of territory by intellectual effort.\" Among the\r\nuniversal poverty money was found for the Universities of Königsberg\r\nand Breslau, and Bonn was founded in 1818. As a result of this policy,\r\ncarried on persistently and continuously by successive ministers,\r\naided by wise councilors, many of them the products of this policy,\r\nsuch a state of things was brought about that not many years ago M.\r\nFerdinand Lot, one of the most distinguished educationists of France,\r\naccorded to Germany \"a supremacy in science comparable to the\r\nsupremacy of England at sea.\"\r\n\r\nBut this position has not been obtained merely by founding new\r\nuniversities. To Germany we owe the perfecting of the methods of\r\nteaching science.\r\n\r\nI have shown that it was in Germany that we find the first organized\r\nscience teaching in schools. About the year 1825 that country made\r\nanother tremendous stride. Liebig demonstrated that science teaching,\r\nto be of value, whether in the school or the university, must consist\r\nto a greater or less extent in practical work, and the more the\r\nbetter; that book work was next to useless.\r\n\r\nLiebig, when appointed to Giessen, smarting still under the\r\ndifficulties he had had in learning chemistry without proper\r\nappliances, induced the Darmstadt Government to build a chemical\r\nlaboratory in which the students could receive a thorough practical\r\ntraining.\r\n\r\nIt will have been gathered from this reference to Liebig's system of\r\nteaching chemistry that still another branch of applied science had\r\nbeen created, which has since had a stupendous effect upon industry;\r\nand while Liebig was working at Giessen, another important industry\r\nwas being created in England. I refer to the electric telegraph and\r\nall its developments, foreshadowed by Galileo in his reference to the\r\n\"sympathy of magnetic needles.\"\r\n\r\nNot only then in chemistry, but in all branches of science which can\r\nbe applied to the wants of man, the teaching must be practical--that\r\nis, the student must experiment and observe for himself, and he must\r\nhimself seek new truths.\r\n\r\nIt was at last recognized that a student could no more learn science\r\neffectively by seeing some one else perform an experiment than he\r\ncould learn to draw effectively by seeing some one else make a sketch.\r\nHence in the German universities the doctor's degree is based upon a\r\nresearch.\r\n\r\nLiebig's was the _fons et origo_ of all our laboratories--mechanical,\r\nmetallurgical, chemical, physical, geological, astronomical, and\r\nbiological.--_Nature._\r\n\r\n[_To be continued._]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[33] An address delivered at the Royal College of Science on October\r\n6, 1898.\r\n\r\n[34] Greek Geometry from Thales to Euclid, p. 2.

G. T. W. PATRICK.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are certain propositions about education so evidently true that\r\nprobably no parent or teacher would question them. For instance, the\r\nbest school is one in which the course of study is progressively\r\nadapted to the mental development of the children. Again, certain\r\nsubjects are adapted to children of certain ages or stages of\r\ndevelopment, and others are not. One would not recommend the study of\r\nlogic or of the calculus to the average child of ten, nor would the\r\nteaching of English be wisely deferred until the age of fifteen.\r\nFinally, if the courses of study in our present school system shall be\r\nfound to be arranged without regard to the order of mental\r\ndevelopment, they will sooner or later be modified in accordance with\r\nit.\r\n\r\nNow the educational system in practice in the two or three hundred\r\nthousand public schools in the United States is a somewhat definite\r\none, with a somewhat fixed order of studies through the different\r\nyears or grades. In a majority of the States children are admitted to\r\nthe schools at the age of six; in more than one third of the States\r\nchildren of five are admitted. In a general way we may say that during\r\nthe first four years of school life the principal subjects occupying\r\nthe time of the children are reading, writing, and arithmetic. To be\r\nmore exact, we may cite, for instance, the city schools of\r\nChicago.[45] Exclusive of recesses and opening exercises, there are in\r\nthese schools thirteen hundred and fifty minutes of school work per\r\nweek. Of this time, in the first and second grades, six hundred and\r\nseventy-five minutes are devoted to reading, seventy-five minutes to\r\nwriting, and two hundred and twenty-five minutes to mathematics.\r\nSeventy-two per cent of the total time is therefore consumed by these\r\nsubjects. In the third grade the proportion is the same; in the fourth\r\ngrade it is somewhat more than fifty per cent. I have mentioned the\r\nChicago schools because this is one of those school systems where a\r\nliberal introduction of other subjects, such as Nature study, physical\r\nculture, singing, and oral English, has somewhat lessened the time\r\ngiven to reading, writing, and arithmetic. Other cities, with few\r\nexceptions, will be found to give more rather than less time to these\r\nsubjects. In the country schools, and indeed in a vast number of town\r\nand city schools, practically all the time during these early years is\r\ngiven to reading, writing, and arithmetic.\r\n\r\nWe must conclude, therefore, if our educational system is a rational\r\none, that reading, writing, and arithmetic are the subjects peculiarly\r\nadapted to the mind of the child between the ages of five and ten. It\r\nis worth while to inquire from the standpoint of child psychology\r\nwhether this be true. It should be observed, in the first place, that\r\nthe manner in which our educational system has grown up is no\r\nguarantee that it rests upon a psychological basis. Our schools are\r\nexceedingly conservative. Any innovations or radical changes are\r\nresisted by the parents of the children even more strenuously than by\r\nschool boards, superintendents, and teachers. Notwithstanding numerous\r\nand important minor improvements, the school system as a whole remains\r\nunchanged. Our children of seven and eight years are learning to read\r\nand write because our grandfathers were so doing at that age.\r\n\r\nWe can not here discuss the origin of our present school curriculum,\r\nbut, as explaining the prominence given to reading, writing, and\r\narithmetic, it is worthy of notice that originally the elementary\r\nschool existed to teach just these three subjects. The primitive\r\nschoolmaster was not superior to the parents of the child, usually not\r\ntheir equal, in anything except his knowledge of \"letters.\" So the\r\nchild was sent to school for a short time to learn letters. It was not\r\nat all the function of the school to _educate_ the child in all that\r\nwas necessary to fit him for the duties of life. Afterward, as the\r\nscope of the school was enlarged, other subjects were added, and these\r\nwere put _after_ the original ones, and the schoolmaster, furthermore,\r\ncame rather to take the place of an educator than a mere teacher of\r\nletters. It is conceivable, therefore, that the present accepted order\r\nof studies in our elementary schools rests upon an accidental rather\r\nthan upon a psychological basis. It is true that modern educators have\r\nexpressly considered the subject of the order and correlation of\r\nstudies, as, for instance, in the case of the Committee of Fifteen,\r\nand that, while recommending minor changes in the school curriculum,\r\nthey have not usually thought of questioning the position so long held\r\nby reading, writing, and arithmetic. In the report of the committee\r\njust referred to we find this expression: \"The conclusion is reached\r\nthat learning to read and write should be the leading study of the\r\npupil in his first four years of school.\" But, again, it was not the\r\nfunction of this committee to suggest sweeping changes, nor to raise\r\nthe inquiry whether the system itself rests upon a psychological\r\nbasis. Even if it did not rest upon such a basis, expressions like the\r\nabove would not be unnatural on the part of committees appointed by\r\nbodies representing the system as a whole.\r\n\r\nWe may not, then, conclude _a priori_ that our system of primary\r\neducation is a sound one. There have indeed been other wholly\r\ndifferent systems giving excellent results in their time, as, for\r\ninstance, that of the ancient Greeks, where music and gymnastics, not\r\nreading, writing, and arithmetic, were the principal subjects\r\noccupying the time of the pupils.\r\n\r\nMuch attention has recently been given to the subjects of the\r\nphysiology and psychology of children. These studies have been\r\nsystematic, painstaking, and exact. It seems, indeed, to many people\r\nimprobable that anything very new or very remarkable should just at\r\nthis time be found out about children, and there have not been wanting\r\neither prominent educators or psychologists who have given public\r\nexpression to warnings against the new \"child study.\" But this, again,\r\nis not conclusive, for students of history may recall that every\r\nadvance in science has met just such opposition--for instance,\r\nbacteriology, organic evolution, chemistry, and astronomy.\r\nFurthermore, when we reflect that scientific advance in this century\r\nhas ever been, and inevitably, from the simple to the complex, and,\r\nfurther, that the brain of the child is the most complex thing in the\r\nwhole range of natural history which science will ever have to\r\nattempt, it is not difficult to understand that scientific knowledge\r\nof it with its pedagogical implications has not belonged, at any rate,\r\nto the past. It will belong to the future, having, perhaps, its\r\nbeginnings in the present. An educational system which has not\r\nreckoned with an accurate knowledge of the brain of the child may by\r\naccident be a correct one, but until such reckoning is made we can not\r\nbe sure.\r\n\r\nOur increasing knowledge of the child's mind, his muscular and nervous\r\nsystem, and his special senses, points indubitably to the conclusion\r\nthat reading and writing are subjects which do not belong to the early\r\nyears of school life, but to a later period, and that other subjects\r\nnow studied later are better adapted to this early stage of\r\ndevelopment. What is thus indicated of reading and writing may be\r\naffirmed also of drawing and arithmetic. The reasons leading to this\r\nconclusion can be only very briefly summarized here.\r\n\r\nAs regards reading, writing, and drawing, they involve, in the first\r\nplace, a high degree of motor specialization, which is not only\r\nunnatural but dangerous for young children. Studies in motor ability\r\nhave shown that the order of muscular development is from the larger\r\nand coarser to the finer and more delicate muscles. The movements of\r\nthe child are the large, free movements of the body, legs, and arms,\r\nsuch as he exhibits in spontaneous play. The movements requiring fine\r\nco-ordination, such as those of the fingers and the eyes, are the\r\nmovements of maturer life. If we reverse this order and compel the\r\nchild to hold his body, legs, and arms still, while he engages the\r\ndelicate muscles of the eyes and fingers with minute written or\r\nprinted symbols, we induce a nervous overtension, and incur the evils\r\nincident to all violation of natural order. The increasing frequency\r\nof nervous disorders among school children, particularly in the older\r\ncountries, is probably due in part to these circumstances. If we\r\nconsider the brain of the child of seven or eight years, our\r\nconclusions are strengthened that he should not be engaged in reading\r\nand writing. At this age the brain has attained almost its full\r\nweight, and is therefore large in proportion to the body. Its\r\ndevelopment is, however, very incomplete, particularly as regards its\r\nassociative elements--that is, the so-called association fibers and\r\napperception centers. Such a brain constantly produces and must expend\r\na large amount of nervous energy, which can not be used\r\ncentrally--that is, psychologically speaking--in comparison, analysis,\r\nthought, reflection. It must flow out through the motor channels,\r\nbecoming muscular movement. The healthy child is therefore incessantly\r\nactive in waking hours, the action being of the vigorous kind\r\ninvolving the larger members. Hence we can understand that, of all the\r\nways in which a young child may receive instruction, the method\r\nthrough the printed book is pre-eminently the one ill fitted to him.\r\n\r\nThe evil of this method is aggravated by the fact that, before the\r\nchild can receive instruction through the book, a long time--several\r\nyears, in fact--is spent in the confining task of learning to read. It\r\ncomes about, therefore, that the child, at the very age when he should\r\nbe leading a free and expansive life, is obliged to fix his eyes upon\r\nthe narrow page of a book and decipher small printed symbols, in\r\nthemselves devoid of life and interest. With respect to writing and\r\nlearning to write the case is worse. A considerable amount of motor\r\nspecialization is involved in forming letters upon the blackboard, but\r\nwhen the pencil and pen are used it becomes of an extreme kind. In the\r\nwhole life history of the man there are no movements requiring finer\r\nco-ordination than those of writing with pencil or pen, yet our school\r\nsystem requires these of the child of six or seven years, makes them,\r\nindeed, a prominent part of elementary school life. In addition to the\r\nmotor specialization of reading and writing is the physical\r\nconfinement in the narrow seat and desk which is necessarily connected\r\nwith them. The child of six or seven has not reached the age when such\r\nconfinement is natural or safe.\r\n\r\nThe injuries which I have mentioned relate to the nervous system as a\r\nwhole. There are other injuries resulting from the reading habit in\r\nyoung children which concern the eyes directly. So much has been said\r\nand written lately about the increase of myopia and other defects of\r\nthe eye among school children, that I shall merely refer to this\r\nsubject here. Upon entering school, children are practically free from\r\nthese defects. Upon leaving school, a strikingly large percentage are\r\nsuffering from them, more, however, as yet, in European countries than\r\nin America. The causes are many, but it is scarcely doubted that the\r\nchief cause is found in bending over finely printed books and maps,\r\nand fine writing, pencil work, and drawing. If pencils, pens, paper,\r\nand books could be kept away from children until they are at least ten\r\nyears of age, and their instruction come directly from objects and\r\nfrom the voice of the teacher, this evil could be greatly lessened.\r\n\r\nIf the above reasons for not teaching reading and writing to young\r\nchildren were the only ones, the objections could to a certain extent\r\nbe overcome. Writing might, for instance, be practiced only on the\r\nblackboard with large free-hand movements, and letters could be taught\r\nfrom large forms upon charts. But we have to consider the questions\r\nwhether reading and writing are in themselves branches of instruction\r\nwhich belong to the early years of school life, whether they may not\r\nbe acquired at a great disadvantage at this period, and whether more\r\ntime is not spent upon them than is necessary. It is a well-known\r\nfact that a child's powers, whether physical or mental, ripen in a\r\ncertain rather definite order. There is, for instance, a certain time\r\nin the life of the infant when the motor mechanism of the legs ripens,\r\nbefore which the child can not be taught to walk, while after that\r\ntime he can not be kept from walking. Again, at the age of seven, for\r\ninstance, there is a mental readiness for some things and an\r\nunreadiness for others. The brain is then very impressionable and\r\nretentive, and a store of useful material, both motor and sensory, may\r\nbe permanently acquired with great economy of effort. The imagination\r\nis active, and the child loves to listen to narration, whether\r\nhistorical or mythical, which plays without effort of his will upon\r\nhis relatively small store of memory images. The powers of analysis,\r\ncomparison, and abstraction are little developed, and the child has\r\nonly a limited ability to detect mathematical or logical relations.\r\nThe power of voluntary attention is slight, and can be exerted for\r\nonly a short time. All this may be stated physiologically by saying\r\nthat the brain activity is sensory and motor, but not central. The\r\nsensory and motor mechanism has ripened, but not the associative. The\r\nbrain is hardly more than a receiving, recording, and reacting\r\napparatus. It would be inaccurate, however, to express this\r\npsychologically by saying that perception, memory, and will are the\r\nmental powers that have ripened at the age of seven. This would be\r\ntrue only if by perception we mean not apperception, which involves a\r\nconsiderable development of associative readiness, but mere passive\r\napprehension through the senses, and if by memory we mean not\r\nrecollection, but mere retentiveness for that which interests, and if\r\nby will we mean not volition, but only spontaneous movement and\r\nreadiness to form habits of action, including a large number of\r\ninstinctive movement psychoses, such as imitation, play, and language\r\nin its spoken form.\r\n\r\nFollowing out, then, somewhat as above, the psychology of the child,\r\nwhat kind of education would be particularly adapted to his stage of\r\ndevelopment? We ask not what _can_ the child be taught, but what\r\nstudies are for him most natural and therefore most economical. In the\r\nfirst place, from the development of the senses and the perceptive\r\npower above described, we infer that the child is ready to acquire a\r\nknowledge of the world of objects around him through the senses of\r\nsight, hearing, touch, temperature, taste, and smell. His education\r\nwill have to do with real things and their qualities, rather than with\r\nsymbols which stand for things. If we wish a general term for this\r\nbranch of instruction, we may call it natural science, or, to\r\ndistinguish it from science in its more mature form as the study of\r\nlaws and causes, we may call it natural history, or, more briefly,\r\nNature study. Although the appropriateness and economy of this study\r\nfor young children has been known and proclaimed for more than a\r\ncentury, it is still in practice the study of later years, while young\r\nchildren study _letters_.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, from the development of the retentive powers of\r\nthe child we infer that he is qualified to gain acquaintance not only\r\nwith the real world around him, but with the real world of the past.\r\nWe may call this history. History is now studied later by means of\r\ntext-books. It may be studied with far greater economy during earlier\r\nyears by means of direct narration by parent or teacher. It is\r\nwonderful how eagerly a child will listen to historical narration, and\r\nhow easily he will retain it. This method of teaching history forms a\r\nstriking contrast to the perfunctory manner in which it is often\r\nstudied in the upper school grades, with the text-book \"lesson,\"\r\n\"recitation,\" and the \"final examination.\" Upon the minds of many\r\nyoung people the study of history has a deadening effect when the\r\nhistory epoch is passed and the mathematical epoch has arrived. It has\r\nalready been proposed, at a conference of educators lately held in\r\nChicago, to extend the study of history downward into the lower\r\ngrades, a proposition fully sanctioned by psychological pedagogy. In\r\nwhat I have here said about history for young people I refer not to\r\nthe philosophy of history, which comes much later in the life of the\r\nstudent, but to history as a mere record of facts and events, the kind\r\nof history which is now studied in the grammar and high schools, the\r\nkind which many educators who would make all children philosophers are\r\nnow saying should not be studied at all.\r\n\r\nIn the third place, what studies correspond to the development of the\r\nwill in the child from five to ten? It is the habit-forming epoch. It\r\nis the time when a large and useful store of motor memory images may\r\nbe acquired, and when permanent reflex tracts may be formed in the\r\nspinal cord and lower brain centers. This is the time to teach the\r\nchild to do easily and habitually a large number of useful things. If\r\nwe use the term in its broadest sense, we may call this branch of\r\ninstruction morals, but it will also include, besides habits of\r\nconduct, various bodily activities, certain manual dexterities, and\r\ncorrect habits of speech, expression, and singing. But here some\r\nrestrictions must be observed. The habit-forming period begins at\r\nbirth and continues far beyond the age of ten, and the period from\r\nfive to ten is not the time for the formation of all habits. The order\r\nof muscular development must be observed, and all dexterities\r\ninvolving finely co-ordinated movements of the fingers, or strain of\r\nthe eyes, should be deferred beyond this period, or at most begun only\r\nin the latter part of it; such, for instance, as writing, drawing,\r\nmodeling, sewing, knitting, playing upon musical instruments, and\r\nminute mechanical work, as well, of course, as the plaiting, pricking,\r\nstitching, weaving, and other finger work still practiced in some\r\nkindergartens and primary schools.\r\n\r\nWe have thus seen that there are certain branches of instruction for\r\nwhich the mind of the child from five to ten has ripened, and which\r\nmay therefore be taught most economically and safely during this\r\nperiod. Concerning the teaching of language I shall speak presently,\r\nbut thus far we have found that from the psychological standpoint\r\nthere are at any rate three subjects which are strikingly adapted to\r\nthis period, namely, natural science, history, and morals, using these\r\nterms with the latitude and restriction already explained. Certain\r\nbranches of Nature study and one branch of what we have called\r\nmorals--namely, manual training--have in recent years been introduced\r\ninto our best elementary city schools, and in a few schools history is\r\ntaught systematically in the lower grades by means of stories. They\r\nhave not, however, crowded out reading, writing, and arithmetic so\r\nmuch as crowded into them. But if we consider the great mass of\r\nschools in city, town, and country throughout the land, the subjects\r\nwhich practically complete the elementary school curriculum--reading,\r\nwriting, arithmetic, and geography--are, with the exception of the\r\nlatter, found to be subjects which do not naturally belong to this\r\nperiod at all. Mathematics in every form is a subject conspicuously\r\nill fitted to the child mind. It deals not with real things, but with\r\nabstractions. When referred to concrete objects, it concerns not the\r\nobjects themselves, but their relations to each other. It involves\r\ncomparison, analysis, abstraction. It calls for a fuller development\r\nof the association tracts and fibers of the cerebral hemispheres. The\r\ngrotesque \"number forms\" which so many children have, and which\r\noriginate in this period, are evidence of the necessity which the\r\nchild feels of giving some kind of bodily shape to these abstractions\r\nwhich he is compelled to study. Under mathematics I do not of course\r\ninclude the mere mentioning or learning a number series, such as in\r\nthe process called \"counting,\" or the committing to memory of a\r\nmultiplication table. Furthermore, in this and in all discussions of\r\nthis kind it must be remembered that there are exceptional children in\r\nwhom the mathematical faculty, or musical faculty, or literary\r\nfaculty, develops much earlier than with the average child. If\r\npossible, they should have instruction suited to their peculiarities.\r\nBut it is evident that, so long as children are educated in \"schools,\"\r\nthere must be a general plan of education, and that it can not be\r\nbased upon exceptional children.\r\n\r\nWhat we learn from physiology and psychology about the ripening of the\r\nchild's mind is confirmed by the theory of the \"culture epochs.\" I can\r\nnot discuss here the doctrine of \"recapitulation,\" with its great\r\ntruths and its minor exceptions, but it is well known that in a\r\ngeneral way the development of the child, both physical and mental, is\r\nan epitome of the development of the race. If we compare the physical\r\nand mental activities of the modern civilized man with those of the\r\nmore primitive member of the race, we may learn what forms of physical\r\nand mental activity are natural in the different periods of child\r\nlife. Some of the things which are characteristic of the modern as\r\ncontrasted with the primitive man are sedentary habits, manual\r\ndexterities requiring finely co-ordinated movements both of the eyes\r\nand fingers, increasing devotion to written language and books as\r\ncontrasted with spoken language, the lessened dependence upon the\r\nmemory, the increasing subjectivity of mental life as contrasted with\r\nthe purely objective life of the savage, and the increased importance\r\nof reflection, deliberation, and reasoning, with decrease of impulsive\r\nand habitual action. These things, then, we should expect to belong to\r\nthe later period of child life, and studied which involve these\r\nactivities will not be economically pursued in the elementary school\r\ngrades. These laws are wholly overlooked in our traditional school\r\ncurriculum. In practice we are saying to the young child: \"Man is a\r\nsedentary, reading, writing, thinking, reasoning being, possessing the\r\npower of voluntary attention. I am to educate you to be a man.\r\nTherefore you must learn to sit still, to read, write, think, reason,\r\nand give attention to your work.\" The child of six or eight years is\r\ntherefore given a book or pen, and put into a closely fitting seat and\r\nleft to give attention to his work. This is precisely as if the mother\r\nshould say to the infant at the beginning of the period of creeping:\r\n\"You are a man, not a brute. Men go upright, not on all fours. You\r\nmust walk, not creep.\"\r\n\r\nI wish to call especial attention to the fact that it is only late in\r\nthe history of the race that language has passed to its written form.\r\nMan is indeed now a reading and writing animal, but only recently has\r\nhe become so. It is only since the invention of printing and the wide\r\ndissemination of books, magazines, and newspapers that reading has\r\nbecome a real determining factor in the life of the people. Even now\r\nthe human organism is engaged in adapting itself to the new strain\r\nbrought upon the eyes and fingers in reading and writing. We can\r\nunderstand, therefore, that it will demand a considerable maturity in\r\nthe child before he is ready for that which has developed so late in\r\nthe history of the race. The language of the child, like that of the\r\nprimitive man, is the language of the ear and tongue. The child is a\r\ntalking and hearing animal. He is ear-minded. There has been in the\r\nhistory of civilization a steady development toward the preponderating\r\nuse of the higher senses, culminating with the eye. The average adult\r\ncivilized man is now strongly eye-minded, but it is necessary to go\r\nback only to the time of the ancient Greeks to find a decided\r\nrelative ear-mindedness. Few laboratory researches have been made upon\r\nthe relative rapidity of development of the special senses in\r\nchildren, but such as have been made tend to confirm the indications\r\nof the \"culture epochs\" theory, and to show that the auditory centers\r\ndevelop earlier than the visual.\r\n\r\nMore and more attention is given in our elementary schools to the\r\nsubject of language--more, as some think, than the relative importance\r\nof the subject warrants; but without discussing this question, it is\r\nindubitably shown by child psychology that it is the spoken language\r\nwhich belongs to the elementary school. The ear is the natural medium\r\nof instruction for young children, and all the second-hand knowledge\r\nwhich it is necessary that the child should receive should come to him\r\nin this way. It should come from the living words of the living\r\nteacher or parent, not through the cold medium of the printed book. In\r\nthe elementary school, then, the child may be instructed in language\r\nas it relates to the ear and the tongue, and this is the real\r\nlanguage. He may be taught to speak accurately and elegantly, and he\r\nmay be taught to listen and remember. He may study in this way the\r\nbest literature of his mother tongue, and get a living sympathetic\r\nknowledge of it, such as can never come through the indirect medium of\r\nthe book. Indeed, this language study need not be limited to the\r\nmother tongue. There is no age when a child may with so great economy\r\nof effort gain a lasting knowledge of a foreign language as when he is\r\nfrom seven to eleven years old.\r\n\r\nWhen the spoken language has been mastered in this way, and when the\r\nchild has arrived at the reading and writing age, language in its\r\nwritten form may be acquired in a very short time, and that which now\r\nfills so many weary years of school life will sink into the position\r\nof comparative insignificance in which it rightfully belongs. Reading\r\nand writing have usurped altogether too much time. In the schools of\r\nto-day there is a worship of the reading book, spelling book, copy\r\nbook, and dictionary not rightfully due them. By dropping the study of\r\nletters from the lower grades much needed time may be found for other\r\ntimely and important subjects, such as Nature study, morals, history,\r\noral language, singing, physical training, and play.\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest goods which would follow the banishing of the book\r\nfrom the primary and elementary schools would be the cultivation of\r\nbetter mental habits. Children suffer lasting injury by being left\r\nwith a book in their seats and directed to \"study\" at an age when the\r\npower of voluntary attention has not developed. They then acquire\r\nhabits of listlessness and mind-wandering afterward difficult to\r\novercome. They read over many times that which does not hold their\r\nattention and is not remembered. Lax habits of study are thus\r\nacquired, with the serious incidental result of weakening the\r\nretentive power which depends so much upon interest and concentration.\r\nWith the substitution of the oral for the book method, reliance upon\r\nthe memory during the memory period will permanently strengthen the\r\nchild's power of retention.\r\n\r\nThe period between the ages of five and ten years is an important one\r\nin the child's life. It is the time when the \"let-alone\" plan of\r\neducation is of most value, for the reason that nearly all our\r\neducational devices beyond the kindergarten are more or less attempts\r\nto make men and women out of children. If the child at this age must\r\nbe put into the harness of an educational system, his course of study\r\nwill not be impoverished by the omission of reading and writing. To\r\nteach him to speak and to listen, to observe and to remember, to know\r\nsomething of the world around him, and instinctively to do the right\r\nthing, will furnish more than enough material for the most ambitious\r\nelementary school curriculum.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[45] See the article on Courses of Study in the Elementary Schools of\r\nthe United States, by T.

D.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe word \"soil\" is used in several arts and sciences to denote the\r\nmaterial from which something derives nourishment. The meat broths and\r\njellies on which bacteria are grown are soils for them, as the earth\r\nof a field is a soil for the ordinary farm crops; but in general we\r\nmean by soils the various mixtures of mineral and organic substances\r\nthat make up the surface of the earth.\r\n\r\nThe object of this paper is to show as briefly as possible the way it\r\nwas formed, of what it is composed, the manner in which it nourishes\r\nplants, and the rules that should guide us in replenishing its\r\nnutritious matter when exhausted. So broad a field can be but lightly\r\ntouched, and the effort will be to give only hints from which rules\r\nfor specific cases may be deduced.\r\n\r\nWhen a sample of ordinary fertile soil is analyzed, it is found to\r\nconsist of a number of minerals, of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus\r\nin various combinations, water, and certain other ingredients\r\ndependent on the locality. Among the minerals the most important are\r\npotassium, sodium, lime, iron, and silicon, and the history of these\r\nis of the greatest interest.\r\n\r\nScientific students are generally agreed that the surface of the earth\r\nis but a shell inclosing a liquid, or at all events a highly heated\r\ninterior. Originally the whole mass was fluid, but the surface has\r\ncooled more rapidly than the interior, and so a firm crust has been\r\nformed. As the central mass cooled, it contracted, and the crust\r\nbecame wrinkled and folded, as does the skin of an apple as its pulp\r\ndries, and, by this folding, great ridges were thrown up in some\r\nplaces and vast depressions formed in others. When the crust became\r\ncool enough for water to remain on it, most of the depressions were\r\nfilled by it, and the \"dry land appeared,\" not only on the crests of\r\nthe ridges, but on the elevated plateaus about them, and thus oceans\r\nand continents were formed.\r\n\r\nHad one of us seen the earth at that time he would have been loath to\r\nselect it as a residence. Rugged, rocky ranges of precipitous\r\nmountains surrounded by stretches of naked rock made the landscape.\r\nDense clouds from the tepid oceans dashed against the icy peaks, and\r\ntorrents of water rushed back to the sea. Where the slopes permitted,\r\nthe glaciers spread over wide areas, for no vegetation checked the\r\nrapid radiation of heat, and night brought bitter cold. The crust\r\nwaved and fluctuated over the liquid interior as does thin ice under a\r\ndaring skater, and as it fell the sea rushed over the land, only to\r\nflow elsewhere as the depressed area rose again. The freezing and\r\nthawing and the effects of wind and water in time produced a change.\r\nThe rocks were riven and broken to powder, their nearly vertical\r\nslopes became less steep, and instead of bare rock the earth showed\r\ndreary morasses and stretches of sand.\r\n\r\nOver these marshes vegetation began to thrive. In the sea there lived\r\nthen, as now, a teeming population, animal, vegetable, and living\r\nbeings that can with difficulty be assigned to either of these\r\nclasses. Each of them, however, contained carbon, and many had built\r\nlime, phosphorus, nitrogen, and other valuable substances into their\r\nbodies. Where food was abundant these grew in vast numbers, and though\r\nmany are infinitely small singly, their aggregate mass is enormous.\r\nAmong the tiny organisms is one called the _Globigerina_, a being so\r\nsmall as to require a microscope to study it, but in the past, as now,\r\ngrowing in great numbers in the sea. The animal is soft and jellylike,\r\nbut it forms an outside skeleton of shell of carbonate of calcium or\r\nchalk, a structure that protects it living, but entombs it dead. When\r\ndeath comes, the little _Globigerina_ sinks to the bottom, and its\r\ntiny shell helps to cover the sea floor.\r\n\r\nIn the days of long ago these lived as now, and when some convulsion\r\nof Nature lifted the bottom of prehistoric seas, the _Globigerina_\r\nooze was lifted as well, and thus the \"limestone\" formed. In our land\r\na bed of this kind extends from Alabama to Newfoundland; thence, as\r\nthe \"telegraphic plateau,\" it passes under the Atlantic, rising into\r\nthe chalk downs and cliffs of England; then, again dipping under the\r\nsea, it passes through Europe, and finally furnishes the marble\r\nquarries of Greece. Heat, water, and chemical action give a ceaseless\r\nvariety to the forms of the limestone, but wherever found it shows the\r\nformer seat of an ocean.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the \"ooze\" was lifted from below the sea it began to\r\nchange. Some has been exposed to heat and has crystallized into\r\nmarble, but for our purposes the most interesting changes have been\r\nwrought by water. Chalk, limestone, and marble--for these are\r\nchemically the same--are almost insoluble in pure water. But water is\r\nrarely pure; it dissolves many things, and among them the\r\ncarbonic-oxide gas that every fire, every animal, every decaying scrap\r\nof wood is pouring into the atmosphere. The rain, charged with this\r\ngas, dissolves the limestone, but when the gas escapes the lime falls,\r\nas you know happens when \"hard\" water is boiled, for the heat drives\r\noff the gas. By this solution, however, the lime is scattered widely\r\nthrough the soil, and is rarely lacking in untilled earth.\r\n\r\nBesides lime, phosphorus is necessary in a good soil. This is widely\r\nspread in Nature, but its great reservoir is the ocean, that boundless\r\nmine of wealth. Many marine animals have the power of building it into\r\ntheir tissues, and the shells of oysters and other mollusks, the bones\r\nof nearly all animals, terrestrial and marine, and parts of other\r\norganisms, are composed of phosphates to a greater or less degree. In\r\nthe ceaseless changes of level the primal oyster beds and coral reefs\r\nare raised to the surface or far above it, and the slow action of time\r\nbegins to tear down the deposits and spread them wide-cast. Since that\r\nfar-off time \"in the beginning\" no new matter has been put on earth\r\nsave the small amounts of the meteorites, and the economy of Nature\r\ncan allow not one atom to lie in idleness, but calls on each one to\r\nplay its part ceaselessly, \"without haste and without rest.\" A certain\r\namount of a substance is disseminated through the earth; by rains it\r\nis washed into the streams, and thence to the sea. Here plants or\r\nanimals eagerly await it, and by means of them it is again restored to\r\nthe land, to begin again its endless round.\r\n\r\nThe metals most necessary for plant life are potassium, sodium, and\r\niron; indeed, the very name of the first shows its importance. If the\r\nashes which contain all the mineral constituents of plants be put in a\r\nvessel and water poured on them, a solution of lye will percolate\r\nthrough the mass. The word lye is an abbreviation for alkali, and when\r\nchemistry became sufficiently advanced, a metal was discovered in this\r\nlye to which the name potassium--i. e., potash-metal--was given. If\r\nseaweeds be burned and leeched in the same way we can obtain from the\r\nlye another metal, sodium, that is much like potassium, and that is\r\none of the most widely spread substances on earth as its chloride, or\r\ncommon salt.\r\n\r\nPotassium and sodium enter into the composition of many rocks, and as\r\nthese become eroded by weather they are scattered through the soil,\r\nwhence their salts are extracted by rootlets and enter into the\r\nformation of vegetable tissue.\r\n\r\nBehind these stands iron. The green coloring matter of plants is a\r\nvery complex substance known as chlorophyll, the duty of which is to\r\ntake carbonic oxide from the air, utilize the carbon, and restore the\r\noxygen. Iron enters into the composition of chlorophyll, and to it is\r\ndue the brown color of dead leaves. This metal is well-nigh universal,\r\nall the reds and browns in soils and rocks being made by it, and so it\r\nis rarely lacking anywhere.\r\n\r\nSo much for the metals in soils; but, important as they are, plants\r\ncan not live on them alone. Among the nonmetallic bodies phosphorus\r\nstands high among essentials, and for it we are indebted to the sea\r\nand the interior of the earth. Many living creatures extract\r\nphosphorus from the sea water--combine it chiefly with lime, and use\r\nthe phosphate for making skeletons or shells, as the case may be.\r\nAfter the death of the possessors the bones or shells sink to the\r\nbottom, as do the _Globigerina_, and in time are either lifted up, as\r\nwere the limestones, and form \"phosphate beds\" like those of Georgia\r\nand Florida, or are dredged up and ground into powder with bones of\r\nland animals.\r\n\r\nMuch of the matter forced up from the interior of the earth contains\r\nphosphorus; indeed, it is the bane of Southern iron ores; but though\r\niron masters dread it, farmers welcome it, as the rains and frosts\r\ncrumble the phosphatic rocks and add them to the mass of _débris_ that\r\nforms our soil.\r\n\r\nNow let us take a test tube and put into it lime, potash, soda, iron,\r\nsilicon, or sand, and phosphorus, add to it a grain of corn, and watch\r\nresults. Under suitable conditions of warmth and moisture the grain\r\nwill sprout, but when the store of food laid up in it is exhausted our\r\nlittle plant will die. It is obvious that something else is needed for\r\na soil, and analysis shows that it is nitrogen, the gas that forms\r\nnearly four fifths of our atmosphere--a gas useless, as such, to\r\nanimals, but essential to plants. Nitrogen is abundant in Nature.\r\nBesides being nearly four fifths of the air, it forms twenty-two per\r\ncent of nitric acid, forty-five per cent of saltpeter or niter,\r\neighty-two per cent of ammonia, and about twenty-five per cent of sal\r\nammoniac. Plants can not use nitrogen in its pure form, but one or\r\nanother of these forms will be found in the soil, whence it may be\r\nextracted.\r\n\r\nNow we have the chief articles of plant food, and it is necessary to\r\nknow how they are to be used. A plant usually consists of two parts,\r\none that appears above ground, bearing branches, twigs, and leaves,\r\nand another that remains below ground. It is this latter that concerns\r\nus now, and it is worth study. This lower part consists of a number of\r\ntwigs called rhizomes, from which proceed a vast number of fine,\r\nthreadlike rootlets, and these are the mouths of the plant, through\r\nwhich it draws nourishment from the earth about it.\r\n\r\nBefore any living thing can use nourishment from without, it must be\r\ndissolved, and this solution requires much preparation at times. Men,\r\nand other animals with a wide range of food stuffs, effect this by the\r\nsecretions of the digestive organs; but most plants have no digestive\r\napparatus, strictly speaking, and were they supplied with an abundance\r\nof the foods they most need, they would starve unless the food were in\r\na suitable state for absorption.\r\n\r\nThe way in which Nature effects this solution is the key to many of\r\nher secrets, and it has been understood only within the past few\r\nyears. If we have a piece of meat freshly taken from an animal we find\r\nit firm, coherent, and almost odorless. If it be put into a warm,\r\nmoist chamber for a few days a great change comes over it, and it\r\nbecomes soft, offensive in odor, and liable to fall to pieces. We say\r\nthat it is rotten or putrid. If a bit of it be put under a microscope,\r\nit is seen to be teeming with bacteria, and these are responsible for\r\nthe decay. Now, if a specimen of earth be examined, we find that it\r\ncontains bacteria, that attack all kinds of organic matter, tearing it\r\nto pieces to get their food, and making many different things out of\r\nwhat is left. There is one sort of ferment that grows in apple juice\r\nand splits the sugar into alcohol and carbonic acid, forming \"hard\r\ncider,\" and if the fermentation stops at this point the well-known\r\ndrink results. However, there is another ferment called \"mother of\r\nvinegar\" that may get in, and, if so, a different kind of fermentation\r\nis started that forms acetic acid instead of alcohol; or the bacteria\r\nof decomposition may come in and the whole go back to its elements.\r\n\r\nThere is a wonderful provision of Nature shown in these stages. The\r\nbacteria--the organisms that produce decay--can not live in a strong\r\nsugar solution, but the ferments, like common yeast, can live in it,\r\nand they split the sugar into alcohol, carbonic oxide, and other\r\nthings. In these another set can live, and when the first have died of\r\nstarvation or from the alcohol they form, the second set step in and\r\nturn the weak alcohol into acetic acid. Acetic acid is a preserving\r\nagent, as our sour pickles show, but if it is not too strong there are\r\nsome organisms that can live in it, and the whole process ends in\r\ndecay. Now, it should be noticed that each of these organisms paves\r\nthe way for the next by converting an unsuitable food stuff into a\r\nsuitable one.\r\n\r\nThis familiar example indicates the lines on which Nature works. It is\r\nthe same everywhere, and shows the advantage of specialization, of\r\nallowing some one with peculiar facilities for performing an act to do\r\nthat exclusively, that others may profit by his skill. So long as each\r\nman sought and killed his food, cooked his meals, made his own\r\nclothing, weapons, and implements--in a word, lived alone--advance was\r\nimpossible. It was only when he who was most skillful with the needle\r\nmade garments for the hunter in exchange for a haunch of venison, that\r\nthe hunter could practice marksmanship, and the tailor design a new\r\ncut for the mantle with which the warrior might dazzle the daughter of\r\nthe arrow maker. It is the same in Nature. Some organisms possess\r\npowers of elaborating certain materials of which others are quick to\r\navail themselves. Plants can manufacture starch, an article needed by\r\nanimals, but of which their own capacity, so far as producing it is\r\nconcerned, is very limited, and thus animals find it advantageous to\r\navail themselves of these stores instead of taxing their own\r\nresources. Similarly, plants need the organic matters of the animal\r\nbodies, and wise agriculture supplies carbon, nitrogen, and other\r\narticles of food in the shape of animal and vegetable refuse. But this\r\nmatter requires digestion; it must be made soluble before it can be\r\nabsorbed, and but few plants can effect this solution unaided. The\r\n\"Venus's flytrap,\" the sundew, the wonderful \"carrion plant,\" and\r\nothers, are equipped with elaborate apparatus by which they are\r\nenabled to capture, kill, and literally digest the insects that supply\r\nthem with nitrogeneous food, but these are exceptional cases. Nature\r\nusually employs other agents.\r\n\r\nThe action of bacteria in causing decay has been said to be in general\r\nsimilar to fermentation--that it is effected by the bacteria in\r\nseeking their food. If oxygen be abundant, putrefaction occurs; if it\r\nbe scant or absent, then fermentation takes place, for the tiny\r\norganisms require oxygen, and, if the air fails them, they pull to\r\npieces the organic matters near them to obtain it. In doing this they\r\nget the nitrogen into such shape that the plants can use it, and thus\r\ndigest their food for them. All organic matter contains carbon,\r\nhydrogen, and oxygen as a general rule, and to these are often united\r\nphosphorus, sulphur, nitrogen, and others, making very complex\r\narrangements, veritable houses of cards, in fact, only held together\r\nby the strange power of life. When a leaf falls or a bird dies, some\r\nof these combinations are broken, and then the bacteria and other\r\nlowly organisms have full sway, for living matter is impregnable to\r\nall save a few of them. As oxygen or something else is taken out of\r\nthe complex molecules, the compound falls to pieces, but as in the\r\nkaleidoscope the bits of colored glass tumble into endless varieties\r\nof symmetrical figures, so do the atoms fall into new combinations. If\r\nthe keystone of an arch be removed, the stones fall apart; but atoms,\r\nunlike bricks or stones, can not stand alone as a rule; they must be\r\nunited to something, and so, as soon as old associations are\r\ndissolved, new ones are formed. These new ones are those needed by\r\nplants, and thus is plant food digested.\r\n\r\nThe term \"plant food\" has been frequently used, and should now be\r\ndistinctly explained, for merely stating the chemical elements is not\r\ndescribing the food. When a physician tells a nurse to feed a patient\r\nhe does not order so much carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and the like,\r\nbut specifies a soup, certain vegetables, and so on, detailing every\r\nparticular; and the same should be done for vegetable invalids.\r\n\r\nIn medical practice a condition is recognized that is called scurvy.\r\nIt is not exactly starvation, but is produced by lack of some food\r\nmaterials usually supplied by fresh vegetables. If scurvy appears at\r\nsea, no amount of meat, bread, cakes, or pastry will stop it;\r\nvegetables, and they only, will stay it. Sometimes a similar condition\r\nprevails among crops: some ingredient in a soil is lacking, and the\r\nothers may be supplied indefinitely without giving the desired relief.\r\nTo this may be attributed much of the fault found with fertilizers;\r\nfor if the soil does not need a particular compound it is useless to\r\napply it, and an excellent fertilizer is often blamed for not\r\nproducing a crop on land already overstocked with it and crying for\r\nsomething else.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose a field on which cotton has been grown for many\r\nsuccessive years until it has become exhausted. Analysis shows that a\r\ncrop yielding one hundred pounds of lint to the acre removes from the\r\nsoil:\r\n\r\n  Nitrogen                 20.71 pounds;\r\n  Phosphoric acid           8.17   \"\r\n  Potash                   13.06   \"\r\n  Lime                     12.60   \"\r\n  Magnesia                  4.75   \"\r\n                           -----\r\n        Total              59.29   \"\r\n\r\nThe weight of the whole crop from which these figures were taken was\r\neight hundred and forty-seven pounds, so that cotton exhausts land\r\nless than any staple crop, if the roots, stems, leaves, etc., be\r\nturned under and only the lint and seed be removed. Of these the lint\r\n(one hundred pounds) takes 1.17 pound from the soil, and the seed\r\n13.89 pounds, making 15.06 pounds net loss.[47] But ignoring returns\r\nthat may be made in the shape of cotton-seed meal, etc., and lime,\r\nwith which our soils are abundantly supplied, we see that nitrogen,\r\nphosphoric acid, and potash have been removed. Suppose the owner puts\r\nbone meal on his exhausted land: the phosphoric acid in the bone will\r\nsupply one need, and an improvement results. On the strength of this,\r\nbone meal will be loaded into the soil again, and let us suppose the\r\ndeficit not yet made up, the crop again shows improvement. Now,\r\nphosphoric acid abounds in the soil, though the deficiency in nitrogen\r\nand potash has become steadily greater; so, when the customary bone\r\nmeal is applied, the crop falls back, because the plants are starving\r\nfor potash and nitrogen. They are like scurvy-smitten sailors, but\r\nmany thoughtless farmers would attribute the decline to the maker of\r\nthe bone meal, and say that its quality was not so high as\r\nformerly--an opinion similar to that of a sea captain who would\r\nascribe to the poor quality of salt beef an outbreak of scurvy on his\r\nvessel.\r\n\r\nAs crops of any description extract potash, nitrogen, and phosphoric\r\nacid from soils, the question how they are to be replaced is an\r\nimportant matter, and its answer may be most readily found by studying\r\nNature's methods. In parts of the Old World there are fields that are\r\nfertile in the extreme after thousands of years of tillage, and it is\r\napparent that mere cultivation does not prove injurious. The tropical\r\nforests have something growing wherever a plant can find foothold--a\r\npopulation in which the struggle for food is secondary to that for\r\nlight and air, and yet the soil supporting this vegetation is\r\nmarvelously rich. Every leaf that falls remains where it fell until in\r\nthe warm, moist, half-lighted forest it becomes a little heap of mold.\r\nThe bacteria of decomposition require warmth and moisture for their\r\nlife; light is deleterious to them, but they thrive in the dense shade\r\nof the jungle. The tangled web of roots, weeds, and vines retains the\r\nrainfall, retarding evaporation, and preventing both droughts and\r\nfreshets. Receiving dead and broken leaves, boughs, and other\r\nvegetable products, and spared the washing of violent torrents, the\r\nforest is inestimably fertile.\r\n\r\nOn a smaller scale this goes on universally. The annual weeds,\r\ndeciduous leaves, and such matter, fall prey to molds and bacteria, by\r\nwhich they are made soluble. Snows and rains bear the products into\r\nthe soil, and there other bacteria, clustering around the roots, form\r\nthe acids needed to complete solution. Every one knows that\r\n\"well-rotted\" manure is better than that which is fresh, and many\r\nwonder at this, but the reason is apparent. In feeding delicate\r\npatients, physicians often prescribe predigested foods or the\r\ndigestive ferments to aid enfeebled assimilation; and similarly the\r\nmanures that have been thoroughly acted on by bacteria, or containing\r\nthose capable of producing the matters that plants need, are of most\r\nvalue for nourishing vegetation.\r\n\r\nIn producing an article of any sort, the cheapness and ease with which\r\nit can be made is largely dependent on the shape in which the raw\r\nmaterial reaches the factory. If a foundry can procure iron that needs\r\nonly to be melted and cast, the owner can fill his orders more\r\nreadily than would be possible if he had to reduce the metal from the\r\nore; and Nature uses this principle over and over again. The\r\nimportance of nitrogen to plants and its abundance in Nature have been\r\nmentioned, but it has also been said that plants can not use it\r\ndirectly, as most animals do with oxygen. The tiny bacteria intervene,\r\nand this they do in two ways: first, by causing decay of animal or\r\nvegetable matter containing nitrogen, and by this decay producing\r\nsubstances that plants can absorb; and, secondly, by producing little\r\nnodules or \"tubercles\" on the rootlets, through which the plant can\r\ntake up nitrogen.[48] Now, when a plant is sated with nitrogen, it\r\nceases to form these tubercles, and their formation is a sure sign\r\nthat the plant is craving this article of food. When it is supplied,\r\nand its own life is ended, these form reservoirs from which other\r\nplants may be supplied, as new castings may be made from broken\r\nwheels. The great value of \"green manuring\" depends on the store of\r\navailable nitrogen so laid up, but it is open to failure in one\r\ndirection. The liability of fermentation to go to the acid stage from\r\ncontamination with acid-forming ferments has been mentioned, an\r\naccident the possibility of which is impressed on us from time to time\r\nby sour bread; and similarly the organic matter turned under may\r\nundergo acid fermentation, rendering the ground \"sour\" and unfit for\r\ncultivation.\r\n\r\nThe limits of this paper forbid the consideration of special\r\nfertilizers, but from the general principles laid down the rules for\r\nany special case may be deduced. A soil should contain a sufficient\r\namount of potash, soda, lime, iron, and a few other minerals;\r\nphosphoric acid, nitrogen, organic matter, and, for some special\r\ncrops, some other ingredients may be needed. When the soil needs\r\nrenewing, there are two ways of accomplishing it. One way is to guess\r\nat what is needed; to buy fertilizers at high prices, without\r\ninquiring whether the soil needs the substances in that particular\r\nbrand or not. Though very common, this is not a good plan. It is as\r\nthough a physician were to give a patient any drug that was\r\nconvenient, without inquiring into the disorder or the needs of the\r\nsystem, and it is followed by much the same result. That acid\r\nphosphate gave Farmer A a good crop, is no reason that Farmer B's land\r\nis also deficient in phosphorus. The same reasoning would teach that a\r\nheart stimulant that rouses a patient from shock would benefit one in\r\ndanger of apoplexy, where the least increase in heart force might be\r\nfatal. A physician using such reasoning as the basis of his practice\r\nwould not be considered a master of his art; and were he to attribute\r\nthe fatal outcome of his logic to the poor quality of his stimulant,\r\nhe would display criminal ignorance of drugs as well as disease; yet\r\nit is very common to see farmers put guano on a soil begging for\r\npotash, and then heap execration on the head of the dealer who sold\r\nthe guano when the crop failed. To revert to a simile used above, a\r\ncaptain must not blame the salt pork for scurvy.\r\n\r\nThe other way to buy and use fertilizers is to ascertain what a\r\ncertain crop needs; then find out whether these be in the soil, and to\r\nwhat extent. With these data the deficiency may be made good without\r\nthe wasteful cost of the former method. State and Federal Departments\r\nof Agriculture furnish their aid freely and gladly, and already the\r\nsigns are seen of the day when agriculture will take its place among\r\nthe semiexact sciences, and the present haphazard methods will become\r\nobsolete.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[46] An address delivered before the Richmond County (Georgia)\r\nAgricultural Society, on February 19, 1898.\r\n\r\n[47] United States Department of Agriculture.

Landrelt, president, announcing Kekulé's\r\ndeath in the German Chemical Society at Berlin, \"will be received with\r\nsorrow not only by our society but by the whole chemical world.\r\nScience has again lost one of its greatest representatives, one of\r\nthose extremely rare spirits who were called upon to found a new epoch\r\nin it and push it mightily forward.\"\r\n\r\nFRIEDRICH AUGUST KEKULÉ was born at Darmstadt, September 7, 1829, and\r\ndied, after a long illness, at Bonn, July 13, 1896. He was originally\r\ndestined by his father for the profession of an architect; and some\r\nhouses, he told his students in a festival address, still existed (in\r\n1892) in Darmstadt of which he drew the plans when, a youth, he was\r\nattending the gymnasium. The leading events of his life were very\r\ntersely told by himself in an address responding to an ovation from\r\nthe students of the University of Bonn on the twenty-fifth anniversary\r\nof his professorship there; a translation of which, from the\r\n_Kölnische Zeitung_, was published by Mr. J. E. Martin in Nature, June\r\n30, 1892.\r\n\r\nAt Giessen, he said, where he went to study architecture, he attended\r\nLiebig's lectures, and was thereby attracted to chemistry. But his\r\nrelatives would not at first hear of his changing his profession, and\r\nhe was given a half-year's grace to think over it. He spent his time\r\nin the Polytechnicum at Darmstadt. His first teacher in chemistry at\r\nDarmstadt was Moldenhauer, the inventor of lucifer matches. His\r\nleisure time was spent in modeling in plaster and at the lathe. He was\r\nthen permitted to return to Giessen. \"I attended,\" he said, \"the\r\nlectures, first of Will and then of Liebig. Liebig was at work on a\r\nnew edition of his letters on Chemistry, for which many experiments\r\nhad to be carried out. I had to make estimations of ash, of albumen,\r\nto investigate gluten in plants, etc. The names of the young chemists\r\nwho helped Liebig were mentioned in the book, among them mine. The\r\nproposal was then made to me, just at the time Liebig intended to make\r\nme his assistant, that I should go for a year abroad, either to\r\nBerlin, which was at that time to Giessen a foreign land, or to Paris.\r\n'Go,' said Liebig, 'to Paris; there your views will be widened; you\r\nwill learn a new language; you will get acquainted with the life of a\r\ngreat city; but you will not learn chemistry there.' In that, however,\r\nLiebig was wrong. I attended lectures by Frémy, Wurtz, Pouillet,\r\nRegnault; by Marchandis on physiology, and by Payen on technology. One\r\nday, as I was sauntering along the streets, my eyes encountered a\r\nlarge poster with the words _Leçons de philosophie chimique par\r\nCharles Gerhardt, ex-professeur de Montpellier_. Gerhardt had resigned\r\nhis professorship at Montpellier, and was teaching philosophy and\r\nchemistry as _privat docent_ in Paris. That attracted me, and I\r\nentered my name on the list. Some days later I received a card from\r\nGerhardt; he had seen my name in Liebig's Letters on Chemistry. On my\r\ncalling upon him he received me with great kindness, and made me the\r\noffer, which I could not accept, that I should become his assistant.\r\nMy visit took place at noon, and I did not leave his house till\r\nmidnight, after a long talk on chemistry. These discussions continued\r\nbetween us at least twice a week for over a year. Then I received the\r\noffer of the post of assistant to von Plauter, at the Castle of\r\nReichenau, near Chur, which I accepted, contrary to Liebig's wish, who\r\nrecommended me as assistant to Fehling, at Stuttgart. So I went to\r\nSwitzerland, where I had leisure to digest what I had learned in Paris\r\nduring my intercourse with Gerhardt. Then I received an invitation\r\nfrom Stenhouse, in London, to become his assistant, an invitation I\r\nwas loath to accept, since I regarded him, if I may be allowed the\r\nexpression, as a _Schmierchemiker_. By chance, however, Bunsen came to\r\nChur on a visit to his brother-in-law, at whose house I first met him.\r\nI consulted Bunsen as to Stenhouse's offer, and he advised me by all\r\nmeans to accept it. I should learn a new language, but I should not\r\nlearn chemistry. So I came to London, where as Stenhouse's assistant I\r\ndid not learn much. By means of a friend, however, I became acquainted\r\nwith Williamson. The latter had just published his ether theory, and\r\nwas at work on the polybasic acids (in particular on the action of\r\nPCl_{5} on H_{2}SO_{4}). Chemistry was at one of its turning points.\r\nThe theory of polybasic radicals was being evolved. With Williamson\r\nwas also associated Odling. Williamson insisted on plain, simple\r\nformulæ, without commas, without the buckles of Kolbe or the brackets\r\nof Gerhardt. It was a capital school to encourage independent\r\nthought. The wish was expressed that I should stay in England and\r\nbecome a technologist, but I was too much attached to home. I wished\r\nto teach in a German university. But where? In order to get acquainted\r\nwith the circumstances at several universities, I became a traveling\r\nstudent. In this capacity I came, among other universities, to Bonn.\r\nHere there was no chemist of eminence, and hence there were no\r\nprospects. Nowhere did there seem so much promise and so great a\r\nfuture as at Heidelberg. I could ask no help of Bunsen. 'I can do\r\nnothing for you,' he said, 'at least not openly. I will not stand in\r\nyour way, but more I can not promise.' I fitted up a small private\r\nlaboratory in the principal street of Heidelberg at the house of a\r\ncorn merchant--Gross, by name--a single room with an adjoining\r\nkitchen. I took a few pupils, among whom was Baeyer. In our little\r\nkitchen I finished my work on fulminate of silver, while Baeyer\r\ncarried out the researches, which subsequently became famous, on\r\ncacodyl. That the walls were coated thick with arsenious acid, and\r\nthat silver fulminate is explosive, we took no thought about. After\r\ntwo years and a half I received a call to Ghent as ordinary professor.\r\nThere I stayed nine years, and had to lecture in French. With me to\r\nGhent came Baeyer. Through the kindness of the then Prime Minister of\r\nBelgium, Rogier, I obtained the means to establish a small laboratory.\r\nI had there with me a number of students, among whom I may name\r\nBaeyer, Hübner, Ladenburg, Wichelhaus, Linnemann, Radzizewski. There\r\nwas not so much a systematic course of instruction as a free and\r\npleasant academic intercourse. After nine years' work I received the\r\ncall to Bonn.\" Professor Kekulé concluded his address with some\r\naccount of his work at Bonn, and of the great attention he had always\r\nreceived from his pupils. For a full account of Kekulé's scientific\r\ncareer and achievements, we are indebted to the memorial address made\r\nby President Landelt to the German Chemical Society on the occasion of\r\nhis death, of which we translate the more important passages from the\r\n_Berichte_:\r\n\r\n\"The works which Kekulé has left behind him belong, as we all know, to\r\nthe bases of all chemistry. His teachings have so passed into our\r\nflesh and blood that it seems almost superfluous to remind a circle of\r\nprofessional chemists of them. I shall be able to present only in the\r\nmost general outlines this evening the immense influence which the\r\ndead master has exercised upon science; a complete view of all his\r\nlabors is a subject for a biography, which we must wait for.\r\n\r\n\"Kekulé's scientific work began in 1854, with the discovery of\r\nthiacetic acid, by which he at once separated from the old school of\r\nchemistry that was still prevailing, and, founding a new one,\r\nrevealed himself as an adherent of the new doctrine of types. After\r\nhis habilitation at Heidelberg, which followed in 1856, came the essay\r\non fulminating mercury, in which the view so important for the future\r\nwas expressed, that to the three typical combinations of\r\nchlorhydrogen, water, and ammonia, hitherto recognized, might be added\r\na fourth, marsh gas. In the next essay, on binary combinations and the\r\ntheory of polyatomic radicals, he put forward the conception of mixed\r\ntypes, and first reached the knowledge of various atomicity or valency\r\nof the radicals. These researches were continued, and there appeared\r\nshortly afterward, in the spring of 1858, the two great treatises\r\nwhich have since exercised so powerful an influence on chemistry--that\r\non the constitution and metamorphoses of chemical combinations, and\r\nthat on the chemical nature of carbon. In these theses Kekulé passed\r\nfrom the valency of the radicals to that of the elements themselves,\r\nand showed that the composition of all those compounds that contain\r\none atom of carbon lead to the conclusion that that element is\r\nquadrivalent; and that, further, the relations of combination of a\r\ncomplex of carbon atoms are explainable if we suppose that the latter\r\nare mutually bound by a certain number of their four unities of\r\nattraction. This idea was suggested very carefully, and the words\r\nwhich the author added at the end of his essay read very curiously\r\nto-day: 'Finally, I think I ought still to insist that I attach only\r\nlittle value to speculations of this sort. Since one delving in\r\nchemistry must once in a while, in the lack of exact scientific\r\nprinciples, content himself with probabilities and temporary\r\nhypotheses, it seems proper to communicate these conceptions, because,\r\nas it appears to me, they furnish a simple and fairly general\r\nexpression for the newest discoveries, and because, therefore, the use\r\nof them may assist in the discovery of new facts.' How diffident the\r\nwords sound, and how far have the expectations been exceeded! We all\r\nknow that the theory of valency is to-day the leading guide through\r\nall our science; and, although another investigator had a share in its\r\norigination, no one disputes that its main foundation and its eminent\r\nvalue in organic chemistry are primarily due to Kekulé's idea of the\r\nquadrivalency of carbon.\r\n\r\n\"After he was called to the University of Ghent, in 1858, Kekulé\r\nexhibited an indefatigable activity. He began the great series of\r\ninvestigations of the organic acids which, beginning with succinic\r\nacid, malic acid, and tartaric acid, and extending afterward to many\r\nothers, have given complete conclusions as to the nature of these\r\nbodies. Contemporaneously, in 1860, appeared the first number of the\r\n_Lehrbuch der organischen Chemie_, which was soon followed by other\r\nnumbers, so that the whole first volume was completed in 1861. All his\r\nfellow-chemists who are acquainted with the events of that period\r\nwill remember the enthusiasm with which the work was received. For the\r\nfirst time, in place of the former system of organic chemistry based\r\non the old radicals of Berzelius, a system of treatment appeared which\r\nin the dress of the theory of types had the doctrine of valency as its\r\nfoundation, and exposed the construction as well as the isomeric\r\nrelations of the numerous carbon compounds with wonderful clearness.\r\nThe work, the first two published volumes of which contained the\r\nsubstances designated by Kekulé as the fatty compounds, is still\r\nrecognized as the prototype of many text-books that followed it.\r\n\r\n\"In 1855 Kekulé put forth the second of his great theories. First in\r\nthe Bulletin of the Chemical Society of Paris, and afterward in fuller\r\nform in Liebig's _Annalen_, appeared the essay, Researches among the\r\nAromatic Compounds, in which he showed that the substances so\r\ndesignated all contain six or more atoms of carbon, and that they\r\ncould be described as derivatives of the simplest of them, benzene. He\r\nproposed two hypotheses to explain the constitution of this substance,\r\none of which, the only one afterward pursued, supposed that the six\r\ncarbon atoms are associated in a ring, and alternately linked by one\r\nand two valencies. By replacing the hydrogen atoms corresponding to\r\neach carbon atom by other elements or radicals one could arrive at the\r\nknowledge of the constitution of a large number of aromatic bodies\r\nwhich now figure as benzol derivatives. These considerations led,\r\nhowever, to another question--namely, whether or not the supplied\r\nplaces of the six hydrogen atoms are chemically equivalent. The\r\nquestion of space relations in chemistry first came up in connection\r\nwith this investigation, and Kekulé at once endeavored to solve it.\r\nAll these ideas were, however, expressed at first with reserve, and\r\nthis essay closes with the words, 'I place no more value on these\r\nviews than they are worth, and I believe that much labor must still be\r\napplied before such speculations can be regarded as anything else than\r\nmore or less elegant hypotheses; but I believe, too, that at least\r\nexperimental speculations of this kind must be used in chemistry.'\r\n\r\n\"In this case, again, Kekulé's modest expectations have been\r\nsurpassed. The wonderful results that have accrued from the benzol\r\ntheory are patent to all of us. We know that it was the instigation to\r\nthe carrying out of an innumerable multitude of researches which are\r\nstill pursued with undiminished industry. Rarely has a thought\r\nexercised so fructifying and forwarding an influence on chemistry, and\r\nso redounded to the advantage of both pure science and art.\r\nThankfulness for this gift, as you know, prompted our society to honor\r\nthe author of the benzol theory and the twenty-fifth year of the\r\nannouncement of it by a public festival; and the Kekulé celebration,\r\nwhich took place in this house on the 11th of March, 1890, is\r\nmemorable to all for the brilliant and witty speech with which the\r\nmaster responded to the many addresses made to him. It is preserved in\r\nour reports (_Berichte_ 23, 1892), and the repeated reading of it\r\nalways affords rich enjoyment.\"\r\n\r\nKekulé assumed his last position, as professor at the University of\r\nBonn, in the fall of 1867. He there devoted his attention for a period\r\nto the erection of a new institute building, but it was not long\r\nbefore numerous works began again to appear--some of them by himself\r\nalone, like the important investigation of the condensation products\r\nof aldehyde; and others in co-operation with his many students. The\r\ncontinuation of his _Lehrbuch_ was taken in hand at the same time. In\r\n1867 he gratified his fellow-chemists by the publication of the first\r\nvolume of his Chemistry of the Benzol Derivatives. This was followed\r\nfrom 1880 to 1887 by single numbers, prepared with the help of\r\nco-workers, of the second and third volumes.\r\n\r\nProf. F. R. Japp, in the Kekulé memorial lecture before the Chemical\r\nSociety of London, speaking of Kekulé's residence in that city,\r\nSeptember, 1897, said that he always acknowledged the influence which\r\nLiebig and Odling and Williamson, with whom he became acquainted in\r\nLondon, exercised on the formation of his opinions. Kekulé's theories,\r\nProfessor Japp said, were based on Gerhardt's type theory; on\r\nWilliamson's theory of polyvalent radicals, which by their power of\r\nlinking together other radicals render possible the existence of\r\nmultiple types; and Odling's theory of mixed types, which was a\r\ndeduction from Williamson's theory. Less consciously, perhaps, his\r\nopinions were influenced by E. Frankland's theory of the valency of\r\nelementary atoms, and by Kolbe's speculation on the constitution of\r\norganic compounds. Kekulé gathered together the various ideas which he\r\nfound scattered throughout the writings of his predecessors, added to\r\nthem, and welded the whole into the consistent system which forms our\r\npresent theory of chemical structure. In 1857, in the course of a\r\nmemoir on the constitution of fulminic acid, he gave a tabular\r\narrangement of compounds formulated on the type of marsh gas, this\r\nbeing the earliest statement, though put forward only in an imperfect\r\nform, of the tetravalency of carbon. In the same year he published an\r\nimportant theoretical paper On the So-called Conjugated Compounds and\r\nthe Theory of Polyatomic Radicals, which contains a complete system of\r\nmultiple types and mixed types. In 1858 the celebrated paper, On the\r\nConstitution and Metamorphoses of Chemical Compounds, and on the\r\nChemical Nature of Carbon, appeared. It embodies the fully developed\r\ndoctrine of the tetravalency of carbon, together with Kekulé's views\r\non the linking of atoms and on the valency of such chains of atoms,\r\nthe foundation on which our modern system of constitutional chemistry\r\nrests. In 1865 Kekulé put forward his well-known benzene\r\ntheory--pronounced by Professor Japp the crowning achievement, in his\r\nhands, of the doctrine of the linking of atoms, and the most brilliant\r\npiece of scientific prediction to be found in the whole range of\r\norganic chemistry. The conception of closed chains, or cycloids, which\r\nhe thus introduced, has shown itself to be capable of boundless\r\nexpansion.\r\n\r\nKekulé's students all speak admiringly of his qualities as a teacher.\r\nThe memorialist of the German Chemical Society said: \"All of us who\r\nhave attended his lectures or heard him in other places will ever\r\nremember what a teacher Kekulé was. With incomparable lucidity and\r\nsometimes with the happiest humor, he could go playfully through the\r\ntheme he was considering, masterfully presenting it in new and often\r\nsurprising aspects. The charm of his personality affected all who came\r\nin contact with him; it was the geniality which shone out of his whole\r\nbeing, and involuntarily commanded admiration. Numerous pupils flocked\r\nto him, and many of those who to-day fill chairs of chemistry in\r\nGermany and other countries have made his name highly honored.\"\r\n\r\nProfessor Thorpe, of London, who spent a little time in Kekulé's\r\nlaboratory, describes him as having been one of the very best\r\nexpositors, with the single possible exception of Kirchhoff, to whom\r\nit had been his lot to listen. As a laboratory teacher he was\r\nexcellent. He was a most severe judge of work, striving to exact the\r\nsame high manipulative finish, the same neatness and order, which he\r\ninvariably bestowed on everything he did, and he was absolutely\r\nintolerant of anything slovenly or \"sloppy.\" \"But it was as a lecturer\r\nthat he was seen at his best. He was singularly luminous as a thinker,\r\na close and accurate reasoner, with a remarkable power of concentrated\r\nexpression.... His language was apt and well chosen, and his delivery\r\neasy and natural\"; and his whole address showed that every detail had\r\nbeen carefully considered.\r\n\r\nAt a distance of thirty years, Professor Dewar said, at the London\r\nmemorial meeting, that to look back and call to mind the presence and\r\npersonality of the great chemist as he knew him was indeed a pleasure.\r\nHe was a man of noble mien, handsome, dignified, and yet of a homely\r\nand kindly disposition. He was a severe critic, having a haughty\r\ncontempt for the accidental and bizarre in scientific work. His\r\noriginality and suggestiveness seemed endless, so that he had no need\r\nto commit trespass or to follow just in the wake of other people's\r\nideas. \"Everything that passed through the Kekulé alembic was indeed\r\ntransmuted into pure gold. His precision of thought and diction\r\nrendered his papers profoundly suggestive to other workers.\"\r\n\r\n\"The last years of the master's life,\" his German eulogist says, \"were\r\noften troubled by illness, but there were not wanting bright days\r\nwhich the love of his students and colleagues prepared for him.\" Such\r\na one was the celebration of the twenty-fifth anniversary of his\r\nprofessorship at Bonn, June 1, 1892, in which the students and\r\nofficers participated with cordial unanimity. The ceremony began in\r\nthe morning with an enthusiastic ovation by the students. The chemical\r\ntheater was decorated with plants; the benzene hexagon was figured on\r\nthe blackboard with garlands of flowers, in the midst of which the\r\nletters A. K. were wrought in a monogram of roses. Alfred Helle, one\r\nof the chemical students, delivered a felicitous address, in which he\r\ncongratulated his fellow-students on being privileged to sit at the\r\nfeet of the greatest of living chemists, after which three cheers were\r\ngiven to the professor. Kekulé responded to the offering in an address\r\ngiving some of the details of his life, from which we have already\r\nquoted. Kekulé's personal staff and the officers of the university\r\nthen presented their congratulations.\r\n\r\nIn the evening the students honored him with a torchlight procession,\r\nit being the third time he had received this, the most conspicuous\r\nhonor which is bestowed by German students. The first occasion was in\r\n1875, when he declined the professorship at Munich; the second was in\r\n1878, when he was rector of the university, and was given in\r\ncelebration of the restoration of unity among the students, after a\r\nlong period of disunion. Among the torchbearers on that occasion was\r\nthe present Emperor of Germany.\r\n\r\nDuring the later period of his life Kekulé was comparatively sterile.\r\nThose who knew him, however, Professor Thorpe says, \"would be the\r\nfirst to affirm that this seeming apathy sprang from no natural\r\nindifference. There is no doubt that he suffered, even in the early\r\nperiod of middle life, from the intense stress and strain of his\r\nmental labors prior to the Ghent period. He too surely exemplified the\r\nsad truth of Liebig's saying that he who would become a great chemist\r\nmust pay for his pre-eminence by the sacrifice of his health. There is\r\nreason to know that it was the consciousness of failing power which\r\nprevented him from finishing much to which he had put his hand, and\r\nthat his fastidiousness and his sense of 'finish,' amounting almost to\r\nhypercriticism, restrained him from publishing much which he realized\r\nfell short of his ideal.\"\r\n\r\nThe last time Kekulé's name was brought before the public was on the\r\noccasion of the renewal of the ancient title of nobility of his\r\nfamily, as August Kekulé von Stradowitz.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEditor's Table.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A VOICE FROM THE PULPIT._\r\n\r\nWe called attention last month to a weak attack on the doctrine of\r\nevolution by a certain Mr. A. J. Smith, Superintendent of Public\r\nSchools in the city of St. Paul. The only thing which gave any\r\nconsequence to the deliverance in question was that it was addressed\r\nto a large gathering of public-school teachers, who might possibly\r\nhave been unduly influenced in their appreciation of it by the\r\nspeaker's official position. We are glad now to learn that, very\r\nshortly after the publication of Superintendent Smith's address, an\r\nexcellent statement of the true relation of the doctrine of evolution\r\nto education was made in one of the city pulpits by the Rev. S. G.\r\nSmith, who did not boast, as the superintendent had done, of having\r\nmade an exhaustive study of the subject, but who, nevertheless, showed\r\nthat he had a grasp of it which the other altogether lacked. The Rev.\r\nMr. Smith's discourse would have merited attention wherever it might\r\nhave been delivered; but, considered as a pulpit utterance, it seems\r\nto us to possess a special and very encouraging significance. We need\r\nhardly say that the pulpit has not always been friendly to broad\r\nscientific views, but in this case it has spoken with a candor, a\r\nbreadth, and an intelligence which the lecture platform can not do\r\nmore than equal, and which it would certainly be too much to look for\r\nin all our colleges.\r\n\r\n\"The law of evolution,\" said the reverend gentleman, \"is as universal\r\nin its application as the law of gravitation. It holds that in every\r\nrealm the simple tends to become complex, and that the complex is more\r\nstable than the simple. Motion and matter have a history in which the\r\nsimple and the indefinite take on variety of organization and\r\ndefiniteness of adaptation.\" This is a statement in which the author\r\nof the Synthetic Philosophy would probably have very little change to\r\nsuggest. Mr. Smith does not, like so many who discuss the subject in a\r\nsuperficial manner, confound evolution with Darwinism. Darwinism, he\r\nrecognizes, may, in its particular explanations as to the origin of\r\nspecies and the descent of life, be in error; but evolution is\r\nuniversal in its scope, and can only fail if it can be shown that the\r\nfundamental postulates on which it rests, such as the instability of\r\nthe homogeneous, the continuity of motion, the law of rhythm, etc.,\r\nare not to be depended on. Must a person have made the circle of the\r\nsciences and comprehended all knowledge before he can reasonably\r\nprofess a belief in evolution? No, says Mr. Smith; when the\r\nfoundations of a doctrine have been clearly laid, when they have been\r\ntested by many different investigators from many different points of\r\nview, and when these, almost without exception, affirm that the\r\ndoctrine is not only in harmony with, but lends a new and deeper\r\nsignificance to, the several orders of fact with which they are\r\nindividually concerned, any person of ordinary intelligence is\r\njustified in considering that doctrine as satisfactorily proved and\r\ngiving it his personal adhesion.\r\n\r\nWhat chiefly excited the ire of Superintendent A. J. Smith was the\r\ncontention of evolutionists that the modern child reflects the earlier\r\nstages of human development. He asked his audience if they really\r\nthought the children of to-day were young savages, and quoted Emerson\r\nand Longfellow as authorities on the question. The Rev. S. G. Smith\r\ntakes up the point and expresses himself as follows: \"When it is\r\nstated that the child has many points of contact with primitive man,\r\nit is not meant that the child is a savage, but that 'in its\r\nimmaturity' we can learn much respecting it from the study of child\r\nraces. The child has neither the virtues nor the vices of the savage,\r\nbut he has many of the mental characteristics. Embryology does not\r\nteach that in prenatal life the child passes into the form of every\r\nanimal in a menagerie, but that its life passes through the stages\r\nthat mark the great subdivisions of all life. Nor do the comparisons\r\nof the child with primitive man imply that he must pass through all\r\nthe activities of savage races, but that the development of his\r\nfaculties, the tendencies of his desires, the state of his ignorance,\r\nall illustrate the history of the development of the race. Primitive\r\nman may be understood by a study of the child, and, conversely, the\r\nchild may be illustrated by primitive man.\"\r\n\r\nIt must be borne in mind that the child is in constant contact with\r\nits elders, that it is subject to the restraints which they impose,\r\nand that it lives more or less in an atmosphere of affection and care.\r\nThere is excellent reason, therefore, why it should not resemble\r\nprimitive man in all points. Its daily life is really controlled and\r\nguided by a higher power. In some cases there is even too much control\r\nand guidance; the conditions are made too artificial, and the\r\ndevelopment of the child's nature suffers in consequence. When the age\r\nof manhood or womanhood is reached there is something lacking,\r\nprecisely because enough scope was not left for the primitive or, as\r\nwe may very properly say, the \"savage\" instincts of childhood. A great\r\nFrench writer, Joseph de Maistre, quotes a popular saying to the\r\neffect that \"spoilt children always turn out well.\"[49] So far as\r\nthere is any truth in it, the explanation is that the spoilt child is\r\none that has a great deal of its own way, and is left to work out the\r\nsavage and so acquire a sounder foundation for its future life. In how\r\nmany of us are there not chained savages that might have made their\r\nescape in earlier years if they had only been allowed! It is a\r\ndangerous thing to try to make little angels of children.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Mr. Smith is quite right in what he says as to the\r\npredominance of the imagination in children, this being another strong\r\npoint of resemblance to primitive man. \"The beginnings of history and\r\ninstitutions,\" he truly says, \"can only be understood when we remember\r\nthat races in their early development do not have clearly marked\r\nactivities of imagination, reason, and memory. They mix the three. So\r\nlegends, myths, and heroics are earnest efforts of the undeveloped\r\nmind to make objective the truth, and are not clumsy lies at all.\"\r\nApplying this to the child, the conclusion is that \"he must be fed\r\nthrough his imagination or he will not grow.\" A very imaginative child\r\nis apt to be accused of falsehood, when he simply fails to distinguish\r\nbetween things imagined and things remembered. Neither the child nor\r\nthe savage can concentrate his attention, and to force either to do so\r\nbeyond a certain very limited measure is simply to injure and deform\r\nsuch natural powers as he possesses. The amount of mischief which a\r\ndogmatic and over-logical teacher, wholly ignorant of the psychology\r\nof the child, can do is beyond all calculation.\r\n\r\nIt is needless, however, to pursue the parallel further, though the\r\nRev. Mr. Smith very properly carries it into the region of morals,\r\nwhere it is no less close than in that of intellectual action. There\r\nis another interesting aspect of evolution which the reverend\r\ngentleman glances at, and that is its bearing on general courses of\r\nstudy. History and literature, considered as departments of research,\r\nit has largely transformed by substituting for conventional categories\r\nand abstract notions the perception of a genetic process pervading all\r\nthe works of the human spirit and linking them into an organic unity.\r\nIn conclusion, we may observe that, if Superintendent A. J. Smith had\r\nnot made some foolish remarks in a rather ostentatious manner, it is\r\nprobable the Rev. S. G. Smith would not have delivered the excellent\r\ndiscourse on which we have commented, and which we feel sure will far\r\noutweigh in general effect the performance which called it forth. The\r\nconclusions to be drawn are the pleasing ones that good may sometimes\r\ncome out of evil, and that a free pulpit is admirably adapted to guard\r\nthe interests of liberty and common sense.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[49] \"Les enfans gâtés réussissent toujours.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_LESSONS OF ANTHROPOLOGY._\r\n\r\nThe address delivered at the last meeting of the British Association\r\nby the president of the Anthropological Section contained nothing that\r\nwas strikingly novel--it is not every year that striking novelties can\r\nbe announced--but it dealt in an interesting manner with several\r\nphases of a most important subject. The speaker, Professor Brabrook,\r\ntook the position that the order of the universe is expressed in\r\ncontinuity, not cataclysm, and that this principle will be found\r\nillustrated in every branch of anthropological research, in direct\r\nproportion to the completeness of the data obtained. He admitted the\r\nvastness of the gap which still separates the remains of palaeolithic\r\nfrom those of neolithic man, but expressed the belief that further\r\nexplorations would bring intermediate relics to light. To quote the\r\nspeaker's words: \"The evidence we want relates to events which took\r\nplace at so great a distance of time that we may well wait patiently\r\nfor it, assured that somewhere or other these missing links must have\r\nexisted, and probably are still to be found.\"\r\n\r\nReference was made to the labors which are now being usefully expended\r\nin gathering what is called the folklore of various communities, and\r\nto the result which continually appears with fuller evidence, namely,\r\nthat the tendency of mankind everywhere is to develop like fancies and\r\nideas at a like stage of intellectual development. Full of detail as\r\nthese stories are, they are found to contain but a few primitive\r\nideas; and it seems not improbable that to a large extent they are\r\nessentially Nature myths. Mr. Brabrook happily quotes Lord Bacon's\r\ndescription of such narratives as \"sacred relics, gentle whispers and\r\nthe breath of better times.\" The \"better times\" are a part of the\r\ngeneral system of myth; but who will deny that there is a special\r\ncharm in these early documents of our race? \"Let one of our literary\r\nexquisites,\" said a thoughtful French writer, \"try to write a fairy\r\ntale which shall neither be a pretentious apologue nor a tiresome and\r\ntransparent allegory, and he will soon feel that mere cleverness does\r\nnot suffice to create these marvelous narratives, and will conceive a\r\njust admiration for those who constructed them, that is to say,\r\neverybody and nobody.\"\r\n\r\nThe progress of anthropology, according to the president of the\r\nsection, seems more and more to confirm the theory adopted by Fustel\r\nde Coulanges in France and Spencer in England, that the belief in\r\nspirits lies at the basis of all religious systems. We thus see, to\r\nuse his words, \"that the group of theories and practices which\r\nconstitute the great province of man's emotions and mental operations\r\nexpressed in the term 'religion' has passed through the same stages,\r\nand produced itself in the same way, from rude early beginnings, as\r\nevery other mental exertion.\" Mr. Brabrook mentions a work lately\r\npublished by \"a distinguished missionary of the Evangelical Society of\r\nParis,\" the Rev. Mr. Coillard, in which an account is given of the\r\nsuperstitions prevailing among the natives of the upper Zambesi. The\r\nreverend gentleman tells of their belief in witchcraft, and gives a\r\nstory of a young woman who was condemned to penal labor on suspicion\r\nof having bewitched, or tried to bewitch, another young woman who had\r\ntaken her husband from her; the evidence of the crime being found in a\r\ndead mouse, which had been discovered in the second young woman's\r\nchamber. The missionary says: \"She was made a convict. A few years ago\r\nshe would have been burned alive. Ah, my friends, paganism is an\r\nodious and a cruel thing!\" On which the president of the\r\nAnthropological Section observes: \"Ah, Mr. Coillard, is it many years\r\nago that she would have been burned alive or drowned in Christian\r\nEngland or Christian America? Surely the odiousness and the cruelty\r\nare not special to paganism any more than to Christianity.\" This is\r\nmuch to the point. If witchcraft is no longer a recognized crime in\r\nEngland or America, it is not because these lands are Christian, but\r\nbecause science is mixed with their Christianity. Even missionaries\r\nought to know this.\r\n\r\nA great many different sciences are grouped under the name\r\n\"anthropology,\" but they all have their rallying point in man, whose\r\nnature and history they seek to explore. The fact is that all sciences\r\nshould have the same rallying point; and we trust that the greater\r\ninterest which is visibly being taken year by year in anthropological\r\nstudies will tend to humanize in a beneficial degree the whole circle\r\nof human knowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\n_AN EXAMPLE OF SOCIAL DECADENCE._\r\n\r\nThat the incessant encroachment of the Government upon the rights of\r\nthe individual will produce social decadence is a truth that most\r\nAmericans have yet to learn. With a light heart they are constantly\r\napproving scheme after scheme for social regeneration that involves\r\nsome restriction upon freedom, or an increase of taxation, or both. It\r\nis not perhaps singular that the history of similar schemes in the\r\npast should possess no lesson for them. When President Eliot, of\r\nHarvard University, says that the experience of the Italian republics\r\nhas no value for us, it is not to be expected that persons with less\r\ncapacity to interpret the records of other times should attach little\r\nor no importance to them. But they ought not most certainly to\r\nmaintain the same attitude toward the experience of the nations of\r\nto-day. It is to blind their eyes to what does not rest upon hearsay\r\nor upon dubious documents--to what admits of the clearest\r\ndemonstration at the hands of living witnesses.\r\n\r\nFor this reason we urge upon all students of social science the study\r\nof the condition of the inhabitants of the black-earth region of\r\nRussia. In that field, one of the largest and most fruitful in the\r\nworld for investigation, they will find the amplest evidence of the\r\nfrightful havoc wrought by the abridgment of individual freedom and\r\nthe seizure of private property in the form of taxes for public\r\npurposes. If it be said that Russia is an autocracy, and can not\r\ntherefore furnish instruction to a democracy like the United States,\r\nthe answer is easy, if not obvious. Despotism, like gravitation, is\r\nthe same all over the world. It makes no difference in the long run\r\nwhether a law abridging freedom issues from the palace of a czar or\r\nfrom the legislative halls of a popular assembly. The individual\r\nobjecting to it is obliged to regulate his life, not in accordance\r\nwith his own notions, but in accordance with the notions of some one\r\nelse. It makes no difference, either, whether taxation is imposed by\r\nan imperial edict or by a legislative vote. The citizens that have to\r\nbear it against their will contribute money for purposes that some one\r\nelse only approves of. The only difference between Russia and the\r\nUnited States is that this kind of despotism has been carried to much\r\ngreater lengths in one country than in the other. If, therefore, we\r\ncan find out what the effect has been in Russia, we will be able to\r\npredict what the effect will be in the United States.\r\n\r\nAs every person familiar with Russia knows, the black-earth region is\r\none of the richest and most productive in the world. It ought to be\r\ninhabited by one of the wealthiest and happiest of peoples. Yet such\r\nis not the case. According to Count Tolstoi, who contributed recently\r\na letter to the London Times on the subject, the inhabitants are among\r\nthe poorest and most miserable in the world. They are in a state of\r\nchronic starvation. They are obliged to content themselves with nearly\r\na third less food than is sufficient to maintain normal health. The\r\nphysical effect of this insufficiency of food is a decrease in\r\nvitality, a diminished stature, and a check to the growth of\r\npopulation. It is proved, first, by the failure of the peasants of the\r\nregion to meet the requirements for military service, and, second, by\r\nthe statistics of population, which show that the increase of births\r\nover deaths has fallen from the maximum reached twenty years ago to\r\nzero.\r\n\r\nBut the mental effects of the destitution wrought by the robberies of\r\nthe Government are more distressing even than the physical. It gives\r\nbirth to a stolidity and despair that tend to paralyze all effort\r\ntoward betterment. The people subjected to it come to feel that there\r\nis no use of making any struggle beyond the maintenance of mere\r\nexistence. Whatever they get in excess of this requirement will be\r\ntaken from them. \"A peasant,\" says Tolstoi, illustrating this fact,\r\n\"feels that his position as an agriculturalist is bad, but he believes\r\nthat it can not be improved; and, consequently, adapting himself to\r\nthis hopeless position, he no longer fights against it, but lives and\r\nacts only in so far as he is stirred by the instinct of\r\nself-preservation. Moreover, the very wretchedness of his condition\r\nincreases still more his depression of spirit. The lower the economic\r\ncondition of a population sinks, like a weight on a lever, the more\r\ndifficult it becomes to raise it again; the peasants feel this, and,\r\nas it were, throw away the helve after the hatchet. 'Why should we\r\ntrouble ourselves?' they say. 'We sha'n't get fat. If we can only keep\r\nalive.'\"\r\n\r\nThe fruits of this mental state are as palpable as those of the lack\r\nof food. They are to be found in every direction. In manners, habits,\r\nand customs the peasants are hopelessly conservative. They belong, not\r\nto the nineteenth century, but to the ninth. Instead of adopting new\r\nand improved methods of agriculture, they cling to those of the\r\nsubjects of Rurik. They use the old plow, distribute tillage in three\r\ncrops, and divide their fields into long, narrow strips. So slowly do\r\nthey toil with primitive implements and debilitated animals, and so\r\nindifferent are they to what they are doing, that it takes them a day\r\nto do the work that a well-fed and alert peasant would do in half the\r\ntime. A more deplorable sign of demoralization is the prevalence of\r\nfamily discord and loss of interest in a higher life. The aggressions\r\nof the state have stimulated selfishness, bad temper, and incipient\r\nrebellion. The children disobey their parents, the younger brothers\r\nreject the primacy of the older, and money earned elsewhere is kept\r\nfrom the family treasury. With the decadence of family life there is a\r\ndecadence of religious life. Although the peasants are nominally\r\northodox, they care nothing for religion. Even the clergy confirm the\r\nfact that they are becoming more and more indifferent to the church.\r\nWhat they seek is not to penetrate the mysteries of life, but to\r\nobliterate consciousness of them. \"Under these circumstances,\" says\r\nTolstoi, alluding to the economic and mental decadence, \"the craving\r\nfor forgetfulness is natural, and accordingly spirits and tobacco are\r\nbeing consumed in ever greater and greater quantities.\" He adds that\r\n\"even quite young boys drink and smoke.\"\r\n\r\nSince the loss of freedom due to the seizure of property is the same\r\nin the last analysis as that due to an abridgment of the right to\r\nthink and act, the evils of ecclesiastical and bureaucratic despotism\r\ndo not differ from those of excessive taxation. Nevertheless, they\r\nreceive separate attention at the hands of Tolstoi. As a proof of the\r\nblight of a church that the peasants have no part in directing, he\r\npoints to the profound and beneficent change wrought the moment they\r\nfall in with a sect of dissenters. \"Their spirits at once rise,\" he\r\nsays, \"and at the same time the foundation of their material\r\nprosperity is laid.\" A blight of the same kind can be traced to the\r\nattempt of the state to play the paternal rôle. \"Nominally,\" says\r\nTolstoi again, \"there exist for the peasants special laws with regard\r\nto the possession and division of land, to inheritance, and to all the\r\nduties connected with it, but in reality there is a kind of\r\nhodge-podge of regulations, explanation, customary laws, decrees of\r\ncourts of cassation, and so on, which naturally makes the peasants\r\nfeel their absolute dependence on the will of innumerable officials.\"\r\nKnowing that they are powerless to resist the Government, which is\r\nconstantly flogging them for disobedience or stupidity, they comply as\r\nbest they can with the thousand rules and regulations made for them.\r\nSeldom do they think of acting upon their own responsibility. Thus\r\nthey lose the power of private initiative. What the impoverishment of\r\ntaxation has not done to ruin them is left to ecclesiastical and\r\nbureaucratic despotism to complete.\r\n\r\nIt is curious to note that Tolstoi's remedy for these evils is the one\r\nthat Herbert Spencer himself might have suggested. With one stroke he\r\ndismisses the prescriptions that the social reformer in the United\r\nStates as well as in Russia attaches so much importance to. It is not,\r\nin his opinion, \"the ministry of agriculture, with all its\r\ncontrivances,\" that will reclaim the peasants, nor is it \"exhibitions\r\nnor schools for rural economy,\" nor that \"unfailing\" remedy \"for all\r\nevils,\" i. e., parish schools. The thing they need is freedom. \"It is\r\nnecessary,\" says Tolstoi, \"to give them religious liberty, to subject\r\nthem to common instead of special laws--the will of rural officials;\r\nit is necessary to give them liberty of education, liberty of reading,\r\nliberty of moving about, and, above all, to remove the power to\r\ntorture brutally by flogging grown-up people simply because they\r\nbelong to the peasant class.\" But to give them such freedom means to\r\ndeliver them not only from excessive taxation but from vexatious rules\r\nand regulations. It is to apply to them the same remedy that must be\r\napplied in the United States to save the American people, now so\r\nheavily taxed and so oppressed by countless laws, from the same social\r\ndecadence that afflicts Russia.\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE ADVANCE OF SCIENCE._\r\n\r\nThe paper by Sir J. Norman Lockyer, which we publish in this number,\r\nrecounts in an interesting manner the steps by which science gained a\r\nplace for itself in the educational systems of the world. To us, in\r\nthe latter years of the nineteenth century, it is apt to seem strange\r\nthat the recognition of science as an essential element in all\r\neducation should have come so late in the world's history; but\r\nreflection shows that it could not well have been otherwise. To view\r\nand examine any subject scientifically involves not only a deliberate\r\nand prolonged mental effort, but the holding in check of some of the\r\nmost active propensities of the human mind, such as imagination and\r\nwhat Bagehot has called \"the emotion of belief.\" In a certain sense\r\nimagination is the precursor of science; but, in the early stages of\r\nhuman development the precursor is mistaken for the true teacher. The\r\nlesson that there is no royal road to truth, nothing but a highway on\r\nwhich much wearisome plodding must be done, is one which human nature\r\nin general does not take to kindly. Even in the present day how many\r\nthere are who chafe at the restraints which Science imposes on belief,\r\nwhose disposition is to break her bonds asunder and have none of her\r\nreproof! When we think, indeed, of what the intellectual condition of\r\nthe world is to-day, with the wonders which science has wrought\r\nraising their testimony on every hand, it is hardly surprising that, a\r\ncouple of centuries ago, it was difficult to get any systematic\r\nprovision made for the teaching of science. However, that battle has\r\nbeen fought and won, and Science has long since definitely entered on\r\nher career of beneficent conquest. Systems founded on imagination, or\r\non merely abstract reasoning, come and go, wax and wane; but the\r\nempire of science once set up can never be subverted. We must hope\r\nthat some day it will rule in the realm of morals as now it does in\r\nthat of material things. Not till then will its perfect work be done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScientific Literature.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL BOOKS.\r\n\r\nProf. _Dean C. Worcester_, of the University of Michigan, spent eleven\r\nmonths, beginning in September, 1887, in the Philippine Islands in\r\nconnection with the second scientific expedition of Dr. J. B. Steere.\r\nHe went there again, with an expedition of which he was chief, in\r\nJuly, 1890, and spent two years and eight months. His object in both\r\nexpeditions was the study of birds. In the course of them he visited\r\ntwenty-two islands. The first expedition was unofficial and was\r\nregarded suspiciously by the authorities of the islands; the second\r\nwas armed with a special permission from the Spanish Minister of the\r\nColonies and enjoyed every advantage. The scientific results of both\r\nwere reported to the United States National Museum, and the\r\ncollections were deposited in its cabinet. The general results, the\r\nstory of the adventures of the members of the expedition, with their\r\nobservations on the geographical features of the islands, their\r\npeoples, and the social conditions prevailing there, are given in a\r\npopular style in the volume before us.[50] The account is preceded by\r\na short sketch of the history of the islands, as an aid to the better\r\ncomprehension of their present condition and the reasons for it. Of\r\nthe natives, who form the bulk of the 8,000,000 of the population of\r\nthe islands, there are more than eighty distinct tribes, each with its\r\nown peculiarities, scattered over hundreds of islands. The more\r\nimportant of these islands may be reached by lines of mail and\r\nmerchant steamers, which afford tolerably frequent communication\r\nbetween them. The difficulties begin when one attempts to make his way\r\ninto the interior of the large and less explored of them, or desires\r\nto reach ports at which vessels do not call. Roads are scarce and to a\r\nlarge extent impracticable, while enemies and dangers are many, and\r\nsuch boats as one can find off the regular routes are precarious. As\r\nto climate, if one is well, able to live as he pleases, and most\r\nscrupulously observes all sanitary rules, keeping the most healthy\r\nspots, he may escape disease; but if he steps a little aside at any\r\npoint he is in danger. It is very doubtful, in the author's judgment,\r\nif many successive generations of European or American children could\r\nbe reared there. Evidences of the action of earthquakes and volcanoes\r\nare seen almost everywhere, and elevation and subsidence are going on\r\nwith great rapidity at the present time. Hence it is not safe to build\r\nsubstantial houses in Manila. The soil is astonishingly fertile:\r\nfruits--in about fifty varieties--are the chief luxury; the value of\r\nthe forest products is enormous; the mineral wealth is great, but has\r\nnever been developed. Professor Worcester speaks of five millions of\r\ncivilized natives of the Philippines. They belong for the most part to\r\nthree tribes: the Tagalogs, Ilocanos, and Visayans. Without drawing\r\nfine distinctions between these, they are regarded as showing\r\nsufficient homogeneity to be treated as a class. They have their bad\r\nqualities and their good, which are reviewed with an apparent\r\ninclination on the part of the author to like them, and the conclusion\r\nthat, having learned something of their power, they will now be likely\r\nto take a hand in shaping their own future. There are also barbarians,\r\nof whom the Moros of Sulu are a type--bloodthirsty and faithless, and\r\nas careless of human life as one would be of weeds in a field; and\r\nsavages of all degrees, down to the lowest. The government is various,\r\naccording to the particular governor and the people he has to deal\r\nwith, but all of the Spanish or Moro type. The clergy are the dominant\r\nclass; and of these the friars or brethren of the orders exert an evil\r\ninfluence, while the Jesuits are believed to be a distinctive power\r\nfor good. Much can be said in favor of the insurgents' demand that the\r\nfriars be expelled from the colony and their places taken by secular\r\nclergymen not belonging to any order. Professor Worcester has made a\r\nvery lively, interesting, and instructive book, which is marred,\r\nhowever, by occasional evidences that, while begun with serious\r\npurpose, it has been hurried to meet a passing demand, and by the too\r\nfrequent intrusion of trivialities and slang.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe are often surprised at manifestations of individuality and\r\nintelligence in domestic animals and pets, and are accustomed to\r\nattribute extraordinary qualities to the beasts in which we perceive\r\nthem; as if each animal could not have its peculiar traits and talents\r\nas well as each man. We hardly imagine that there are any special\r\ndifferences in wild animals, and that idiosyncrasies of character and\r\ndiversities of gifts and powers of adaptation may run through the\r\nwhole animal kingdom. A closer acquaintance with Nature would teach us\r\nbetter. Certain stories and myths of savages show that they had a fair\r\nappreciation of the individual peculiarities of animals, and farmers'\r\nboys, who live in natural surroundings, know something of these\r\nthings. The subject is now presented to us in a fairly clear light by\r\nMr. _Ernest Seton Thompson_, as illustrated in the careers of a number\r\nof typical specimens of animals and birds whose characters and acts,\r\nas they came under his observation, are related in _Wild Animals I\r\nhave Known_.[51] The stories, he avers, are true; the animals in the\r\nbook are all real characters. They lived the lives he has depicted,\r\nand showed the stamp of heroism and personality more strongly by far\r\nthan it has been in the power of his pen to tell. Among them was Lobo,\r\nthe wolf, of the Corrumpaw Cattle Range, New Mexico, the leader of a\r\ngang, who exhibited some of the qualities of an able general, and was\r\na beast of influence, powerful, vigilant, crafty, and the terror of\r\nthe settlement; and who was only trapped when grief for the loss of a\r\nfemale companion deprived him of the wit by which he had escaped all\r\nprevious efforts to take him. Silverspot, the crow, was the leader of\r\na large band. He had his calls, which the other crows obeyed, and was\r\nalways to be seen at the head of his company in their incursions into\r\nthe fields, and guiding them in their journeys northward and\r\nsouthward. Raggylug, the rabbit, is acknowledged to be a composite,\r\nembodying in one the ways of several rabbits, their nesting habits and\r\nways of concealment and devices to baffle pursuers. Bingo, the dog,\r\nhad associates as well as enemies among the wolves, and different\r\ncharacters by day and by night. In a similar way to these, the traits\r\nof the fox, the pacing mustang, other dogs than Bingo, and the\r\npartridge are portrayed. In all the stories the real personality of\r\nthe individual and his view of life are the author's theme, rather\r\nthan the ways of the race in general, as viewed by a casual and\r\nhostile human eye. The moral is suggested by the lives and emphasized\r\nby Mr. Thompson, that \"we and the beasts are kin. Man has nothing that\r\nthe animals have not at least a vestige of; the animals have nothing\r\nthat man does not at least in some degree share. Since, then, the\r\nanimals are creatures with wants and feelings differing only in degree\r\nfrom our own, they surely have their rights.\" It would be hard to\r\nspeak too well of the graphic expressiveness of the illustrations.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[50] The Philippine Islands and their People.

Professor Todd was the astronomer of the party,\r\nand Mrs. Todd, who has published a work on astronomy, was his\r\ncompanion. She believes that certain aspects of the trip, covering as\r\nit did more than ten thousand miles of sailing for the party, and at\r\nleast forty-five thousand miles of deep-sea voyaging for the Coronet,\r\nwere worthy of narration. The astronomical purposes of the expedition,\r\nthe objects it sought to obtain, the scientific bearings of the\r\nobservations, and the methods, are intelligibly set forth in the\r\nintroduction to the book. The rest is devoted mostly to narrative, the\r\nsocial aspects of the voyage, and the incidents. A short sojourn was\r\nmade at the Sandwich Islands, where the more interesting objects were\r\nvisited. Mrs. Todd was with Kate Field when she died there, and gives\r\nan account of her last hours. A voyage of four weeks carried the party\r\nto Yokohama, whence some of the members went to the capital and other\r\ninteresting points in Japan, while the rest were preparing the\r\nobserving station at Esashi, eleven hundred miles north of\r\nYokohama--\"a village on the shores of the Sea of Okotsk, among the\r\nhairy Ainu,\" in a region so remote that the native steamers had only\r\nrecently begun to go there at all. Besides the account of the\r\nobservations, descriptions are given of such Japanese experiences as\r\nlife in Kioto, cormorant fishing, yachting in the Inland Sea, the\r\ntidal wave, and observations among the Ainu, with a visit on the way\r\nhome to an Arizona copper mine.\r\n\r\nThe late Prof. _James D. Dana_ had begun a revision of his _Text-Book\r\nof Geology_ a short time before his death. Prof. William North Rice\r\nwas requested by his family to complete the revision, and the result\r\nis the present volume.[53] It was intended in the original plan of\r\nrevision to preserve as far as possible the distinctive\r\ncharacteristics of the book. It was to be brought down to date as\r\nregards its facts, but was still to express the well-known opinions of\r\nits author, with the general plan of arrangement kept unchanged. It\r\nsoon became evident, however, that more and greater changes than had\r\nbeen contemplated would be required. The zoölogical and botanical\r\nclassifications would have to be modified; the theory of evolution\r\nmust have more recognition than it had received, especially as\r\nProfessor Dana himself had adopted some of its features before his\r\ndeath; and the treatment of metamorphism was believed to require\r\nconsiderable modification. In the present edition the bearing of\r\nvarious events in geological history upon the theory of evolution is\r\npointed out in the appropriate places, and the general bearing of\r\npaleontology upon evolution is discussed in the concluding chapter.\r\nAll these changes seem to be in the line of continuing the usefulness\r\nof Professor Dana's most excellent and standard work, and of keeping\r\nhis name before students as that of \"one of the greatest of geologists\r\nand one of the noblest of men.\"\r\n\r\nA true son of Nature is Mr. _F. Schuyler Mathews_, and he shows\r\nhimself at his best in his _Familiar Life in Field and Forest_.[54]\r\n\"There are few things,\" he says, \"more gratifying to the lover of\r\nNature than these momentary glimpses of wild life which he obtains\r\nwhile passing through the field or forest. Wild animals do not confine\r\nthemselves exclusively to the wilderness; quite frequently they\r\nventure upon the highway, and we are apt to regard the meeting of one\r\nof them there as a rare and fortunate occurrence. The daisy and the\r\nwild rose appear in their accustomed places on the return of summer,\r\nand the song sparrow sings in the same tree he frequented the year\r\nbefore; but the wood-chuck, the raccoon, and the deer are not so often\r\nfound exactly where we think they belong. To seek an interview with\r\nsuch folk is like taking a chance in a lottery; there are numerous\r\nblanks and but few prizes. But because wild life is not in constant\r\nevidence, like the wild flower, is no proof that it is uncommon. To\r\nthose who keep in touch with Nature, it becomes a very familiar thing,\r\nand to live a while where the wild creatures make their homes is to\r\ncross their paths continually.\" Mr. Mathews is in touch with Nature.\r\nHe does not exactly know where to find the wild and shy, for they do\r\nnot come at call, but he can put himself where he will meet them if\r\nthey come around--and \"one can never tell at what moment some\r\nsurprising demonstration of wild life will occur at one's very\r\ndoorstep.\" In this book Mr. Mathews records some of his meetings, at\r\nhome and in his daily walks, offering as his excuse for the record,\r\nthat he has lived long enough among wild animals to \"respect their\r\nrights of life, and speak a good word for them when occasion offers.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Short Manual of Analytical Chemistry_,[55] prepared by Mr. John\r\nMuter, follows the course of instruction given in the South London\r\nSchool of Pharmacy. Encouraged by the continued favor which the book\r\nhas received in Great Britain, the author offers a special edition of\r\nit to American students, a concise and low-priced manual, designed to\r\nintroduce them to the chief developments of analytical chemistry from\r\nthe simplest operations upward. It includes many organic questions\r\ngenerally overlooked in initiatory books. By working through it the\r\nauthor claims the student may expect to become familiar with a great\r\nvariety of processes, and to be in a position to use with satisfaction\r\nthe more exhaustive treatises dealing with any special branch he may\r\ndesire to follow. In preparing it for American students, the\r\ndirections, wherever the British methods differ from the American,\r\nhave been modified to agree with the latter. The processes given\r\ninclude the qualitative analysis, all the general operations and those\r\nrelating to detection of the metals, of acid radicals and their\r\nseparation, of unknown salts, of alkaloids and certain organic bodies\r\nused in medicine--with a general sketch of toxicological procedure;\r\nand in quantitative analysis, directions on weighing, measuring, and\r\nspecific gravity; gravimetric analysis of metals and acids, ultimate\r\norganic analysis, special processes for the analysis of air, water,\r\nand food; analysis of drugs, urine, and calculi; and analysis of\r\ngases, polarization, spectrum analysis, etc.\r\n\r\nThe pure geometry of position is mainly distinguished, according to\r\nProfessor Reye's definition,[56] from the geometry of ancient times\r\nand from analytical geometry, in that it makes no use of the idea of\r\nmeasurement. Nothing is said in it \"about the bisection of segments of\r\nstraight lines, about right angles and perpendiculars, about ratios\r\nand proportions, about the computation of areas, and just as little\r\nabout trigonometric ratios and the algebraic equations of curved\r\nlines, since all these subjects of the older geometry assume\r\nmeasurement.... We shall be concerned as little with isosceles and\r\nequilateral triangles as with right-angled triangles; the rectangle,\r\nthe regular polygon, and the circle are likewise excluded from our\r\ninvestigations, except in the case of these applications to metric\r\ngeometry. We shall treat of the center, the axes, and the foci of\r\nso-called curves of the second order, or conic sections, only as\r\nincidental to the general theory; but, on the other hand, shall become\r\nacquainted with many properties of these curves, more general and more\r\nimportant than those to which most text-books upon analytical geometry\r\nare restricted.\" Of all the other branches of geometry, the\r\ndescriptive is the most helpful in facilitating the study of the\r\ngeometry of position; and perspective or central projection plays an\r\nimportant part in it. It stands in a certain antithetical relation to\r\nanalytical geometry on account of its method, which is synthetic, and\r\nwhence it is sometimes known as synthetic geometry. Since metric\r\nrelations are not considered in it, its theorems and problems are very\r\ngeneral and comprehensive. As presented in von Standt's complete work,\r\nit is regarded by the author as an excellent aid to the exercise and\r\ndevelopment of the imagination; and the important graphical methods\r\nwith which Professor Culmann has enriched the science of engineering\r\nin his work on graphical statistics, being based for the most part\r\nupon it, a knowledge of it has become important for students of that\r\nscience. In the present work, the outgrowth of his lectures, Professor\r\nReye has attempted to supply the want of a text-book which shall offer\r\nto the student the necessary material in a concise form.\r\n\r\nProf. _Cyrus Thomas_ brings the qualification which a lifetime devoted\r\nto study of the subject develops, to the preparation of an\r\n_Introduction to the Study of North American Archæology_.[57] He is\r\nknown to all students in this branch as a careful, judicious\r\ninvestigator whose work in the field has been supplemented by valuable\r\ncontributions to its literature. In this volume he presents a brief\r\nsummary of the progress that has been made in the investigation of\r\nAmerican antiquities--which has been recently great indeed, and well\r\ncalls for a new synopsis. His chief object has been to present the\r\ndata and arrange them so as to afford the student some means of\r\nbringing his facts and materials into harmony, and of utilizing them.\r\nHe presents the theories that have been advanced, and mentions\r\nopposing views; regarding it, he says, as important to the progress of\r\nthe student to know which of the questions that arise have been\r\nanswered, and which hypotheses have been eliminated from the class of\r\npossibilities. The materials for the study and the methods are first\r\nexplained. The relics of ancient men and the mounds are then described\r\nas under three divisions--the Arctic, the Atlantic, and the Pacific.\r\nLocal as well as regional characteristics and differences are pointed\r\nout; as in the mounds as a whole, the special class of animal mounds,\r\nthe pueblos, the cliff dwellings, and the Mexican and Central American\r\nmonuments, the peculiar features of each are pointed out, and their\r\nterritorial limits are defined. All these various kinds of works are\r\nascribed to substantially the same people, who are supposed to have\r\ncome down from somewhere in the north or northwest (the extreme\r\nnorthwest Pacific coast), although the different immigrations may\r\nperhaps have arrived by various routes. The people were the present\r\nIndians or their ancestors; the time of the immigration was not\r\nextremely remote; and the \"mound-building habit\" is shown to have\r\npersisted and been practiced till since the advent of the Europeans.\r\n\r\nIn entitling his book _The Art of Taxidermy_,[58] the chief of the\r\nDepartment of Taxidermy in the American Museum of Natural History\r\nevidently intends to use the word art in the high sense of a fine art;\r\nfor he speaks of the enormous strides toward perfection which it has\r\nmade from the former \"trade of most inartistically upholstering a\r\nskin\"--stuffing it, we used to call it--and of its study having been\r\ntaken up of late years by a number of men of genius and education. It\r\nis largely owing to the exertions of these men that the taxidermy of\r\nthe present day is so far in advance of what it was a decade since.\r\nThe proverb says that art is long, and accordingly Mr. Rowley takes\r\nfor the motto of his book a sentence from Thoreau, that \"into a\r\nperfect work time does not enter.\" To the possible objection that some\r\nof his methods seem to involve considerable time and expense, the\r\nauthor replies in substance that if the work is not worth this, it is\r\nhardly worth while to take it up at all. If it is a proper work, and\r\none has the proper degree of energy and enthusiasm, let him give the\r\nspecimen all the time it demands. In preparing his treatise, the\r\nauthor has aimed to eliminate all extraneous matter, and to give\r\nmainly the results of his own experience, coupled with that of other\r\ntaxidermists with whom he has come in contact. He begins with\r\ninstructions about collecting tools and materials, and casting, and\r\ntreats further of the preparation of birds, of mammals, and of fish,\r\nreptiles, and crustaceans; the cleansing and mounting of skeletons,\r\nand the reproduction of foliage for groups. The appendix contains\r\naddresses of reliable firms from whom tools and materials used in\r\ntaxidermy may be purchased.\r\n\r\nThe preparation of this book on _The Storage Battery_ was suggested to\r\nMr. Treadwell[59] by his finding a lack in working on these machines\r\nof any compact data concerning their construction, and the paucity of\r\nreliable discharge curves; and he concluded that a book containing\r\nsuch data and curves, with rules for the handling and maintenance of\r\ncells, would be valuable to all interested in storage batteries as\r\nwell as to the student and manufacturer. Among the points specially\r\nmentioned by the author are the lists of American and foreign patents\r\ngiven as footnotes for the various types, not complete but noticing\r\nthe principal patents for each cell; the chapter on the chemistry of\r\nsecondary batteries, which gives the latest and most generally\r\naccepted theory concerning the chemical reactions taking place in an\r\naccumulator, and which has been approved by Dr. Sewal Matheson; and,\r\nin the appendix, tables of data comprising figures of all the\r\nbatteries, methods for the measurement of the E. M. F. and internal\r\nresistance of a storage battery; and data from which the theoretical\r\nand practical capacity of an accumulator may be determined.\r\n\r\nThe _Natural Advanced Geography_[60] is a successful application of\r\nmodern methods to the teaching of this science, and presents it with\r\nthe interest undiminished which really appertains to it. While in the\r\nelementary book of this, the \"natural\" series, the pupil starts from\r\nhis own home and is introduced to the study of man in relation to his\r\nenvironment, in the present work the fact is developed that\r\nenvironment itself is the chief factor in the various activities and\r\neconomies of man. One of the salient features of the presentation of\r\nthe subject, marked throughout the work, and one that commands high\r\npraise, is the arrangement of the facts into such order that their\r\ncorrelation may be perceived and the unity of Nature recognized. The\r\nisolated, barren, curt, unrelated statements that made the study of\r\nmany of the old geographies hard and tedious are conspicuously absent,\r\nand the subject, studied in orderly sequence, \"unfolds itself\r\nnaturally and logically, each lesson preparing the way for those which\r\nfollow.\" The first part of the work is devoted to a study of the world\r\nas a whole. The second part, comprising about three fourths of the\r\nvolume, is an application of these laws to the various countries of\r\nthe globe, beginning with the United States. In the United States, for\r\ninstance, a general description of the whole is given, which presents\r\na real, comprehensive mental picture of the country; and the process\r\nis repeated, in measure according to the conditions, for the several\r\nStates, so that the pupil is taught what are the factors that give the\r\ncharacteristics and local features to each. A like method is pursued,\r\non a more general scale, with other countries. The colored maps are\r\ndrawn on a system of uniform scales, with reliefs plainly shown\r\naccording to the accepted conventions; graphic charts or sketch maps\r\nshowing the distribution of products and resources are employed; and\r\npedagogical exercises and aids are afforded abundantly.\r\n\r\nA text-book on the _Differential and Integral Calculus_,[61] for\r\nstudents who have a working knowledge of elementary geometry, algebra,\r\ntrigonometry, and analytical geometry, by Prof. _P. A. Lambert_, has\r\nthe threefold object of inspiring confidence, by a logical\r\npresentation of principles, in the methods of infinitesimal analysis;\r\nof aiding, through numerous problems, in acquiring facility in the use\r\nof these methods; and, by applications to problems in physics,\r\nengineering, and other branches of mathematics, to show the practical\r\nvalue of the calculus. By a division of the matter according to\r\nclasses of functions, it is made possible to introduce these\r\napplications from the start, and thereby to arouse the interest of the\r\nstudent. By simultaneous treatment of differentiation and integration\r\nand the use of trigonometric substitution to simplify integration it\r\nis sought to economize the time and effort of the student.\r\n\r\n_The Birds of Indiana_, by _Amos W. Butler_, lately published as part\r\nof Willis S. Blatchley's Twenty-second Annual Report on the Geology\r\nand Natural Resources of Indiana, is just at hand. It is one of the\r\nmost accurate, detailed, and satisfactory local catalogues yet\r\npublished. Three hundred and twenty-one species of birds have been\r\ntaken in Indiana, and of each of these is given a detailed\r\ndescription, with a general account of its habits, song, migration,\r\nand nesting. In the case of the more rare species, full records of the\r\ndates and places of capture of the known specimens are appended.\r\nAnalytical keys to genera and species are also given, so that every\r\nfacility is furnished for the identification of species. This book is\r\na model of its kind, and is a worthy fruit of Mr. Butler's twenty\r\nyears of devoted study of the birds of his native State.\r\n\r\n_Robert H. Whitten_, in his monograph on _Public Administration in\r\nMassachusetts_--the relation of central to local activity--pursues a\r\nparallel course with that taken by Mr. John A. Fairlie in a similar\r\nessay on the Centralization of Administration in New York State, of\r\nthis same series of Columbia University studies in History, Economics,\r\nand Public Law. Having found the systems and tendencies of\r\nadministration in the early settlement of Massachusetts all for\r\nexpansion and decentralization, Mr. Whitten now perceives the course\r\naltogether changed, and centralization more and more the rule. The\r\nchange corresponds with changes in the conditions of life, and keeps\r\ntrack with them step by step. Of great dynamic forces which have been\r\nset to work and are bringing about a complete reconstruction of the\r\nsocial structure, improvements in transportation and communication\r\nwere the most vital--first, turnpikes, then the steamboat, railroad,\r\nand telegraph; then the horse railway, cheap postage, the telephone,\r\nthe electric railway, and the bicycle. The tendency at first was to\r\nbring about a concentration which was attended by the congestion of\r\npopulation in cities and the depopulation of the rural towns. \"The\r\nelectric railway, the telephone, and the bicycle came in to counteract\r\nthese evils; while their tendency is strongly toward the\r\ncentralization of bureaus, it is also toward the diffusion of\r\nhabitations. These great socializing forces, going hand in hand with\r\nthe development of the factory system and improvement of machinery,\r\nmake possible a vastly higher organization of society than was\r\npossible under a stagecoach _régime_.\"\r\n\r\nThe first volume of the Final Report of the State Geologist of New\r\nJersey, on Topography, Magnetism, and Climate, was published in 1888.\r\nOther volumes embracing other topics have been published since, and in\r\nthe meantime the supply of the first volume has been exhausted, while\r\nthe demand has continued. It has been therefore necessary either to\r\nreprint the volume or to publish a new work which should include the\r\nimportant statistical matter of it. Accordingly, we have now _The\r\nPhysical Geography of New Jersey_, prepared by Prof. _Rollin D.\r\nSalisbury_, with an appendix embodying \"Data pertaining to the\r\nPhysical Geology of the State,\" by Mr. C. C. Vermeule, who was\r\nformerly in charge of the topographic survey, and is author of the\r\nvolume on water supply. The two parts of the volume treat of the\r\ntopography of New Jersey as it now is, and the geological history of\r\nthe topography. The report is accompanied by a relief map of the\r\nState, prepared by Mr. Vermeule on the basis of the topographical\r\nsurvey, and presenting, therefore, an accurate picture of the relief.\r\nIt shows the great features of the State, its ranges of mountains,\r\nhills, tablelands, plains, marsh lands, streams, and water areas in\r\ntheir proper relations to one another; and it is contemplated to put\r\nit in every schoolhouse in the State as an aid in the study of\r\ngeography.\r\n\r\nM. _Imbert de Saint-Amand's_ series of books about the Second French\r\nEmpire furnish very interesting reading, are, so far as our\r\nrecollection of events goes, historically accurate, and fill a gap\r\nwhich the literary world always has to suffer concerning any period\r\ntoo recently passed for a competent judicial mind to have appeared to\r\ntell its story. The second of the series--_Napoleon III and his\r\nCourt_--takes Louis Napoleon at the height of his success and\r\nhappiness, just after he had married the beautiful Eugénie, of whom\r\nthe world has nothing harsh to say, and carries him through the\r\nperiod of his wonderful popularity and brilliant accomplishments to\r\nthe close of the Crimean War and the birth of the prince whose fate\r\nwas so unhappy. It deals, in a pleasant manner, and all favorable to\r\nNapoleon, but not adulatory, with affairs social, political, and\r\nmilitary, in which it is hard to say whether the tact or the good\r\nfortune of the subject of the history shone most brilliantly. We are\r\ntold how Eugénie won the French nation; of Napoleon's good will,\r\nespecially manifested toward all that could contribute to his\r\nexaltation; of his dealings with the sovereigns around him, gradually\r\nwinning their recognition, including that of Nicholas of Russia; of\r\nthe darkening of the clouds of war, the Crimean campaigns; of the\r\ninterchanges of courtesies, gradually rising into close, firm\r\nfriendship, with the British court; and of the birth of the Prince\r\nImperial. Think what we may of the character of the reign of Louis\r\nNapoleon and of its influence, it marked an epoch in nearly every line\r\nof development of the world's history, and was as distinctly separated\r\nfrom what came before it and from what followed it as if a broad line\r\nwere drawn around it; and it left some important results that are not\r\nlikely to be soon effaced. M. de Saint-Amand writes from personal\r\nknowledge, having witnessed or participated in much of what he\r\ndescribes, and has in Elizabeth Gilbert Martin a fully competent and\r\nacceptable translator. (Published by Charles Scribner's Sons. Pp. 407.\r\nPrice, $1.50.)\r\n\r\nThe paper of the late Dr. _Theodor Eimer_ on _Orthogenesis and the\r\nImpotence of Natural Selection in Species Formation_ is published by\r\nthe Open Court Company, Chicago, as No. 29 of their Religion of\r\nScience Library. Pp. 56. Price, 25 cents.\r\n\r\nThe second volume of Uncle Robert's Geography, of Appletons'\r\nHome-Reading Series--_On a Farm_--Mr. _Francis W. Parker_, the editor,\r\nand _Nellie Lathrop Helm_, emphasizes the importance of parents and\r\nteachers, giving full and complete recognition of the immense\r\neducational value of spontaneous activities as displayed in motive and\r\ninterest; a recognition which \"should be followed by active\r\nencouragement and direction of the child's play, work, and\r\nobservations.\" The story deals entirely with the interests and life of\r\nchildren in the environment of the country. A little girl is in her\r\nplayhouse in a Virginia fence corner, with her doll and mimic\r\nhousekeeping. Her shy, retiring companions are the birds who peep into\r\nthe playhouse, and, after she has gone away, come into it and pick up\r\nthe crumbs she has left. This leads to talks about different birds and\r\ntheir nest building. A St. Bernard dog is introduced and furnishes the\r\nopportunity for bringing in stories of the Alps, their glaciers and\r\nsnows, and the Hospice of St. Bernard, and then about other dogs. Susy\r\nmakes a garden in the woods, and the wild flowers become the subjects\r\nof her spontaneous study. So with the rabbits, bread making and the\r\ngrain that furnishes the material for the bread, and other incidents;\r\nwith more birds' nests; the nature of bulbs, squirrels, etc.; and\r\nfinally Uncle Robert sets the child to finding out how the animals in\r\nthe woods spend the winter, and whether they are doing anything now in\r\npreparation for it. (New York: D. Appleton and Company. Price, 42\r\ncents.)\r\n\r\nThe _Thirty-fifth Annual Report_ of the Secretary of the State Board\r\nof Agriculture of Michigan includes the Ninth Annual Report of the\r\nAgricultural College Experiment Station, and is largely taken up with\r\nthe work of the latter institution, reviewing the records of the\r\ncollege departments and presenting the reports and bulletins of the\r\nstation. The record of meteorological observations, the Proceedings of\r\nthe Farmers' Institutes, the Transactions of the Association of\r\nBreeders of Improved Live Stock, and the Transactions of the State\r\nAgricultural Society are also incorporated in the volume. An\r\ninteresting feature of the publication is the insertion of a portrait\r\nand biographical notice of one of the pioneer farmers of the State,\r\nEnos Goodrich, who was also prominent in public life.\r\n\r\nThe translation by _Eleanor Marx Aveling_ of Lissagaray's _History of\r\nthe Commune of 1871_ was made many years ago at the request of the\r\nauthor from a contemplated second edition which the French Government\r\nwould not allow published. The work having been revised and corrected\r\nby the translator's father, and for other reasons, no changes have\r\nbeen made to adapt it to the time of its issue from the press. The\r\ntranslator claims that Lissagaray's work is the only reliable and\r\naccurate history that has yet been written of the Commune. He has not\r\nattempted, she says, to hide the errors of his party, or to gloss over\r\nthe fatal weakness of the revolution. Of course, a very different view\r\nof the movement is given from that presented in the French accounts,\r\nas well as that generally held by English and Americans; but the\r\ncommunists have a right to be represented and heard, and it is well\r\nthat they have so competent a spokesman.

There was a\r\npeculiar fitness in his delivering the Huxley lecture, for, while\r\nProfessor Virchow's work has been chiefly that of the specialist, his\r\nco-operation with laborers in other fields, his continued efforts to\r\npopularize science, and the prominent position which he has occupied\r\nfor the last thirty years in public life, have given him a standing in\r\nGermany somewhat akin to that of Huxley in England. His career is a\r\nstriking illustration, as was also Huxley's, of the happy results to\r\nhumanity from a combination in one man of great ability as an\r\ninvestigator with a facility for generalization and the practical\r\napplication of scientific truths to the concrete problems of science\r\nand civilization. Professor Virchow is described as modest and\r\nunassuming, and very much of a contrast in all ways to the ordinary\r\nGerman professor. His address was on The Recent Advances in Science,\r\nand their Bearing on Medicine and Surgery. It was inevitable that he\r\nshould refer to Huxley, of whom he was in some sense a pupil. In\r\nspeaking of the rapid growth of the latter during his four years on\r\nthe Beagle, he said: \"How this was possible any one will readily\r\nunderstand who knows from his own experience how great is the value of\r\npersonal observation.... Freed from the formalism of the schools,\r\nthrown upon his own intellect, compelled to test each single object as\r\nregards properties and history, we soon forget the dogmas of the\r\nprevailing system, and become first a skeptic and then an\r\ninvestigator.\" This paragraph is especially worthy of notice, because\r\nit points out one of the invariable characteristics of the great man.\r\nIn whatever field his greatness may lie, he will be found to have\r\nbroken away from the formalism and conservatism of the schools, and\r\nthat his great work is based on personal observation and research.\r\nThis was notably the case with Professor Virchow's establishment of\r\nthe cellular pathology, as well as of Huxley's researches in\r\ncomparative anatomy. Our present school system is lamentably weak in\r\nthis particular, tending to stifle rather than stimulate originality\r\nand self-dependence. Professor Virchow's address was, of course,\r\ninteresting and instructive, but, as he said, much too short for\r\nanything like an adequate treatment of the subject. The chief interest\r\nof the occasion lay in its associations. An address by Rudolph\r\nVirchow, at a meeting presided over by Lord Lister on an occasion\r\ncommemorating Professor Huxley, left only one thing to be desired--the\r\npresence of the latter. For a biologist, or in fact a modern scientist\r\nof any description, one can not imagine a more delightful occasion.\r\n\r\n=The Climate of Cuba.=--Systematic records of weather appear to be\r\nwanting in Cuba. The meteorological observations kept up for several\r\nyears by Andre Poey are not accessible, no need of their being\r\npublished having been found. The chief source of information on the\r\nsubject is the observations which have been kept up at Belen College,\r\nHavana, since 1859. From these and a few scattered observations of\r\nbrief periods at other towns, and by comparison with notes taken at\r\nother West Indian stations, W. F. B. Phillips, of the United States\r\nDepartment of Agriculture, has attempted to describe the climate of\r\nCuba. The average annual temperature of the past ten years at Havana\r\nwas 77° F., and the difference between the highest and the lowest\r\nyearly means was only 1.1° F. The warmest month is July, with an\r\naverage temperature of 82.7° F., and the coldest is January, with an\r\naverage temperature of 70.3° F. The highest temperature recorded was\r\n100.6° F., in July, 1891, and the lowest 49.6°. Brief intermittent\r\nrecords at Matanzas, more than sixty years old, give a mean annual\r\ntemperature of about 78°, with 93° as the highest and 51° as the\r\nlowest. At Santiago the annual mean appears to be about 80°, and the\r\ndifference between the warmest and coldest months about 6° F. Records\r\nof temperature in the interior, such as they are, give annual means of\r\nfrom 73.6° to 75°, apparently showing lower temperatures than on the\r\ncoast. The average daily range of temperature is about 10°, the\r\nhighest occurring between noon and two o'clock P. M., while sudden\r\nvariations in the temperature of the day are not unknown. The average\r\nyearly rainfall at Havana is about fifty-two inches. The season of\r\nheavy rainfall begins in the latter part of May and first of June, and\r\nlasts till October, and during this period about sixty-three per cent\r\nof the year's rain is precipitated. Rain occurs on about one day in\r\nthree, in heavy downpours of short duration. Notwithstanding the\r\nfrequency of rain during the summer months, these do not present the\r\ngreatest number of cloudy days. The days on which rain does not fall\r\nare usually perfectly cloudless, and, in general, no clouds are seen\r\nin summer except while the showers are falling; while in other months\r\ncloudy days sometimes occur without rain. The average velocity of the\r\nwind is about 7.5 miles an hour, with variations, according to the\r\nseason, from 8.5 miles in winter to 6.5 miles in summer. The diurnal\r\nvariation in wind velocity is much more pronounced than the seasonal\r\nvariation.\r\n\r\n=The New Planet D Q.=--The number of minor planets discovered during\r\nthe last few years, and their lack of practical importance in\r\nastronomy, has tended to distract astronomers' attention from the\r\nsearch for them, as unprofitable, and the announcement of a new one\r\nattracts little attention, as a rule. The planet D Q, however,\r\ndiscovered by Herr Witt, of the Urania Observatory, of Berlin, on\r\nAugust 13th last, has aroused from the first special attention through\r\nits remarkable behavior. The orbit is a very unusual one. Mars has\r\nalways been considered our nearest neighbor, although it was known\r\nthat some of the minor planets were slightly nearer to the sun when at\r\nperihelion than Mars is when at aphelion. But the mean distances of\r\nthe latter were in all cases much greater than that of Mars; while\r\nthat found for the new planet is only 1.46 as compared with 1.52 for\r\nMars, and, as the eccentricity amounts to 0.23, the perihelion\r\ndistance is only 1.13, and the least distance from the earth's orbit\r\nonly 0.15 as compared with 0.27 for Venus in transit, and 0.38 for\r\nMars in perihelion. The planet will thus be far closer to us than any\r\nother member of the solar system, and will afford a most excellent\r\nmeans of determining the sun's parallax. Its diameter is thought to be\r\nabout seventeen miles.\r\n\r\n=Extra-Organic Factors of Evolution.=--Observing that our civilization\r\nhas made advances or \"strides\" in recent years out of all proportion\r\nto any improvements that have taken place in our organic faculties,\r\nArthur Allin has insisted, in Science, on the importance of\r\nextra-organic factors in human development. Our sense and motor\r\norgans, he says, are essentially instruments and tools, and so is the\r\nbrain; and most if not all of the three hundred or more mechanical\r\nmovements known in the arts are found exemplified in the human body.\r\nOur sense organs are thus indefinitely multiplied and extended by such\r\nextra-organic sense organs as the microscope, telescope, resonator,\r\ntelephone, telegraph, thermometer, etc. Our motor organs are\r\nmultiplied by such agencies as steam and electrical machines, etc., in\r\nthe same manner. \"The printing press is an extra-organic memory far\r\nmore lasting and durable than the plastic but fickle brain. Fire\r\nprovides man with a second digestive apparatus by means of which hard\r\nand stringy roots and other materials for food are rendered digestible\r\nand poisonous roots and herbs innocuous. Tools, traps, weapons, etc.,\r\nare but extensions of bodily contrivances. Clothing, unlike the fur or\r\nlayer of blubber of the lower animals, becomes a part of the organism\r\nat will. One finds himself more or less independent of seasons,\r\nclimates, and geographical restrictions.\" By organic heredity or the\r\ntransmission of the congenital characteristics of the parents to the\r\nchildren, working alone, all progress depends upon the transmission of\r\nvariations occurring within the organism. \"Moreover, these\r\nadvantageous organic variations die with the individual, and must be\r\nborn again, so to speak, with each new individual.\" This requires\r\ntime, and progress depending on it would be indefinitely protracted.\r\nOn the other hand, by means of social heredity, each new member of the\r\nrace has handed to him at birth the accumulated organic advantageous\r\nvariations of sense and motor organs, and the extra-organic\r\nadaptations that have multiplied so indefinitely in the age of\r\ncivilized man. \"The vast importance of accumulation of capital is\r\nobvious.\"\r\n\r\n=Fossils as criterions of Geological Ages.=--Prof. O. C. Marsh said in\r\na paper on The Comparative Value of Different Kinds of Fossils in\r\ndetermining Geological Age, which was read at the meeting of the\r\nBritish Association, that the value of all fossils as evidence of\r\ngeological age depends mainly upon their degree of specialization. In\r\ninvertebrates, for example, a lingula from the Cambrian has reached a\r\ndefinite point of development from some earlier ancestor. One from the\r\nSilurian or Devonian, or even a later formation, shows, however,\r\nlittle advance. Even recent forms of the same or an allied genus have\r\nno distinctive characters sufficiently important to mark geological\r\nhorizons. With ammonites the case is entirely different. From the\r\nearliest appearance of the family the members were constantly\r\nchanging. The trilobites show a group of invertebrates ever subject to\r\nmodification, from the earliest known forms in the Cambrian to the\r\nlast survivors in the Permian. They are thus especially fitted to aid\r\nthe geologist, as each has distinctive features and an abiding place\r\nof its own in geological time. In the fresh-water forms of\r\nmollusca--the Unios, for example--there is little evidence of change\r\nfrom the palæozoic forms to those still living, and we can therefore\r\nexpect little assistance from them in noticing the succeeding periods\r\nduring their life history. The same law as to specialization holds\r\ngood among the fossil vertebrates.\r\n\r\n=Pedigree Photographs.=--Sir Francis Galton unfolded before the\r\nBritish Association a plan for the systematic collection of\r\nphotographs of pedigree stock, particularly of cattle breeds, and of\r\nmore information about them than is now obtainable. He believes that a\r\nsystem of this sort would greatly facilitate the study of heredity.\r\nThe author had previously shown how the general knowledge that\r\noffspring can inherit peculiarities from their ancestry as well as\r\nfrom their parents was superseded by a general law the nature of which\r\nwas first suggested to him by theoretical considerations, and this\r\nancestral law proves the importance of a much more comprehensive\r\nsystem of records than now exists. The breeder should be able to\r\ncompare the records of all the near ancestry of the animals he\r\nproposes to mate in respect to the qualities in which he is\r\ninterested. No present source for such information is comparable with\r\nwhat the system proposed would furnish. A habitual study of the form\r\nof each pure-bred animal in connection with the portraits of all its\r\nnearest ancestry would test current opinions and decide between\r\nconflicting ones, and could not fail to suggest new ideas. Likenesses\r\nwould be traced to prepotent ancestors, and the amount of their\r\nseveral prepotencies would be defined; forms and features that\r\nsupplement one another or \"nick in,\" and others that clash or combine\r\nawkwardly, would be observed and recorded; and conclusions based on\r\nincomplete and inaccurate memories of ancestry would give way to\r\nothers founded on more exact data. The value of the ancestral law\r\nwould be adequately tested, and it would be possible to amend it when\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\n=English Names for Plants.=--In the Proceedings of the Torrey\r\nBotanical Club, published in its journal for July, Dr. V. Havard\r\nsuggested some principles which it would be well to follow in applying\r\nEnglish names to plants, predicating that an authorized vernacular\r\nbinomial should be assigned to each plant, so that ambiguity and\r\nconfusion may be avoided. In the absence of suitable English names\r\nalready recognized, it seems best to adopt the Latin genus name, if\r\nshort and easy, like _Cicuta_, _Parnassia_, _Hibiscus_, or a close\r\ntranslation thereof, when possible, like astragal, chenopody,\r\ncardamin, while the specific English name should be an equivalent of\r\nthe Latin one or a descriptive adjective. In case of all English\r\nbinomials clearly applying to well-known individual species and no\r\nothers, all substantives are capitalized without a hyphen, as in Witch\r\nHazel, May Apple, and Dutchman's Pipe. In all genera in which two or\r\nmore species must be designated, the genus name is compounded into one\r\nword without a hyphen, as Peppergrass, Sweetbrier, Goldenrod,\r\nHedgenettle, etc.; except in long names, where the eye requires the\r\nhyphen, as Prairie-clover, Forget-me-not. Genus names in the\r\npossessive case (St. John's-wort) are written with the hyphen,\r\nfollowed by a lower-case initial. Plants commemorating individual men\r\n(Douglas Spruce, Coulter Pine) are written without the mark of the\r\npossessive. In specific names participial endings are suppressed, the\r\nparticiple becoming a substantive, which is added as a suffix without\r\nthe hyphen; thus Heartleaved Willow is changed to Heartleaf Willow. In\r\nthe discussion that followed this paper, President Addison Brown and\r\nDr. T. F. Allen deprecated the manufacture of book names. The\r\nsecretary defended the use of vernacular names, saying that they\r\ndeserved more attention, and adding that in their absence the generic\r\nname should be used unchanged. Many Latin names, as _Portulacca_, win\r\ntheir way without change as soon as they are fairly made familiar.\r\n\"Coined names seldom live. A name to be successful must be a growth,\r\nas language is.\"\r\n\r\n=Cooking Schools in Philadelphia.=--The establishment of schools in\r\nPhiladelphia for the teaching of cookery is mentioned, in the Annual\r\nReport of the Superintendent of Public Schools in that city, among the\r\nresults of the general movement for manual training, as a means of\r\nmental development and practical knowledge. The teaching was\r\nintroduced experimentally into the Girls' Normal School in 1887, and\r\nwas in the following year made a regular branch of the course. It was\r\nlater extended to other schools. There are now eight school kitchens\r\nunder the department of Public Instruction, situated in different\r\nparts of the city. The question of the proper place for cookery in the\r\nschool course has been solved, for Philadelphia, by putting it in the\r\nsixth school year, when the pupils are firmly established in the work\r\nof the grammar grades, and their attention has not yet been directed\r\nto preparation for admission to the High School. The course provides\r\nbetween twenty-five and thirty lessons, and is completed in a single\r\nyear. It includes instruction in the care of the kitchen, and of the\r\nstove or range, general lessons in the classification and nutritive\r\nvalues of foods, the cooking of vegetables, breakfast cereals, bread,\r\neggs, soups, meats, simple cakes and desserts, lessons in invalid\r\ncookery, and in table setting and serving. Special attention is given\r\nto the preparation of nutritious and savory dishes from inexpensive\r\nmaterials. About two thousand pupils, or less than one half of the\r\nnumber of girls of the sixth year now in the schools, are accommodated\r\nin the eight cookery schools. The pupils manifest an intelligent\r\ninterest in the instruction, and spend the half day per week in the\r\nschool kitchen without any appreciable loss in the other branches of\r\nstudy. \"It comes as a period of relaxation.\"\r\n\r\n=A Trait Common to us All.=--The doctrine of the tendency of mankind\r\nto develop the like fancies and ideas at the like stage of\r\nintellectual infancy was mentioned by Mr. E. W. Brabrook in his\r\npresidential address before the Anthropological Section of the British\r\nAssociation, as a generalization for which we are fast accumulating\r\nmaterial in folklore. It is akin to the generalization that individual\r\nsavage races present in their intellectual development a marked\r\nanalogy to the condition of the earlier races of mankind. The fancies\r\nand ideas of the child resemble closely the fancies and ideas of the\r\nsavage and the fancies and ideas of primitive man. Mrs. Gomme has\r\nfound that a great number of children's games consist of dramatic\r\nrepresentations of marriage by capture and marriage by purchase, and\r\nthat the idea of exogamy is distinctly embodied in them. There can be\r\nlittle doubt that they go back to a high antiquity, and there is much\r\nprobability that they are founded upon customs actually existing, or\r\njust passing away, at the time they were first played. Upon the same\r\nprinciple, if we view children's stories in their wealth of details,\r\nwe shall deem it impossible that they could have been disseminated\r\nover the world otherwise than by actual contact of the several peoples\r\nwith each other. But if we view them in their simplicity of idea, we\r\nshall be more apt to think that the mind of man naturally produces the\r\nsame result under like circumstances, and that it is not necessary to\r\npostulate any communication between the peoples to account for their\r\nidentity. It does not surprise us that the same complicated physical\r\noperations should be performed by far-distant peoples without any\r\ncommunication with each other; why should it be surprising that mental\r\noperations, not nearly so complex, should be produced in the same\r\norder by different peoples without any such communication?\r\n\r\n=The Toes in Walking.=--An instructive discussion of the walking value\r\nof the lesser toes by Dr. Heather Bigg is given in a recent copy of\r\nthe London Lancet. Dr. Bigg believes that the lesser toes of the human\r\nfoot are of little importance in walking--the great toe constituting\r\nthe important tread of the foot--and in proof of this he gives an\r\naccount of a patient, all of whose lesser toes it was found necessary\r\nto amputate because of persistent contraction of the tendons. On\r\nNovember 10, 1894, the toes were removed, especial care being taken to\r\nkeep the resulting scars well up on the dorsal aspect of the foot, so\r\nas to be well away from the subsequent tread. In three weeks the\r\npatient could stand on her feet, and, after her return home, sent the\r\nfollowing record of her progress toward complete recovery: December\r\n30, 1894: \"I am able to walk perfectly on my feet with little or no\r\npain, but can not yet wear either slippers or boots, as they are still\r\ntender.\"--January 15, 1895: \"I managed to get on my slippers yesterday\r\nand wore them with ease for more than six hours.\"--January 28th: \"I\r\nput on my boots to-day for the first time. It still pains me slightly\r\nto walk; otherwise my feet are going on all right.\"--February 18th: \"I\r\nought to say that the steel plates only half way answer\r\nsplendidly.\"--March 24th: \"You will be glad to hear that I can walk\r\nsplendidly now, just like a proper human being; it is just eighteen\r\nweeks next Tuesday since the operation.\"--May 5th: \"I have decided to\r\ncome to town next Monday week to let you see how well I can\r\nwalk.\"--June 17th: \"I played two sets of tennis on Saturday, and my\r\nfeet were none the worse afterward.\"--July 24th: \"You will be\r\nsurprised to hear that the big toes have lengthened half an inch since\r\nthe operation, and I have had all my boots lengthened and the toe line\r\nmade straighter.\"--August 30th: \"I know that you will be interested to\r\nhear that I have just accepted an invitation to a dance on September\r\n13th. Whether I shall dance comfortably or not is another\r\nthing.\"--September 14th: \"I went to the dance on Tuesday evening and\r\nthoroughly enjoyed myself after not dancing for so long. My feet were\r\non their best behavior, and did not pain me once during the evening. I\r\nnever realized before that I had no toes until I began to dance; then\r\nit seemed so odd only to have one toe, but I suffered no inconvenience\r\nwhatever from the loss of them.\"--December 5th: \"I get on so well with\r\nmy bicycle.\" Only two disadvantages showed themselves as the result of\r\nthe operation and these were temporary. One was that the great toes\r\ntended to pervert themselves toward the middle line of the feet, a\r\nthing which was readily remedied by the use of single-toed stockings,\r\nand by packing the space in the boot left vacant by the missing toes\r\nwith cotton wool; the other was a loss of local sense on the outer\r\nsides of the feet, which went to show that the lesser toes were missed\r\nrather as tactile organs than anything else. This failure of feeling\r\nrighted itself in time, presumably by a vicarious and intenser sense\r\nbeing acquired by the skin of the outer side of the foot. In all other\r\nrespects the loss of the toes discovered no inconvenience.\r\n\r\n=Animals' Bites.=--That there is something more serious than the mere\r\nwound in the bite even of a healthy animal is attested by Mr. Pagin\r\nThornton, from a chapter in his own experience, and in the testimony\r\nof a number of his own friends who have suffered for weeks together\r\nfrom having been bitten. \"And what is more surprising to me,\" he says,\r\n\"is that some of us may have hands crippled for some time from bites\r\nof a man's teeth.\" Dog bites are always dangerous, but largely from\r\nthe size of the wound which a dog biting in earnest will inflict. With\r\nmen they usually fail to do their best. Animals recover from wounds\r\nmore easily than men do; but Lord Ebrington says that deer bitten by\r\nthe dogs in Exmoor hardly ever recover. Much of the poisoning caused\r\nby bites is supposed to be due to the state of the animal's teeth; and\r\nin this way the bite of a herbivorous animal, whose teeth are usually\r\nsoiled, may cause worse after effects than that of a carnivore, whose\r\nwet mouth and wet tongue keep its teeth fairly clean. A similar\r\ndifference is observable in the effects of being clawed and bitten by\r\ncarnivora. Wounds made by the claws of leopards are poisonous, while\r\nthose caused by the teeth are rarely septic. The force with which a\r\nbite in earnest is inflicted is an important element in its dangerous\r\ncharacter. \"It seems,\" says the London Spectator, \"as if for the\r\nmoment the animal threw all its force into the combination of muscular\r\naction which we call a 'bite.' In most cases the mere shock of impact,\r\nas the beast hurls itself on its enemy, is entirely demoralizing, or\r\ninflicts physical injury. A muzzled mastiff will hurl a man to the\r\nground in the effort to fasten its teeth in his throat or shoulder.\r\nThen, the driving and crushing force of the jaw muscles is\r\nastonishing.\" Sir Samuel Baker noticed that the tiger usually seized\r\nan Indian native by the shoulder, and with one jaw on one side and the\r\nother on the other bit clean through chest and back. In nearly all\r\ncases the bite penetrates to the lungs. This kind of wound is\r\ncharacteristic of the bites of the _felidæ_. Hardly any bird recovers\r\nfrom a cat's bite, for the same reason. The canine teeth are almost\r\ninstantly driven through the lung under the wing.\r\n\r\n=Doulton Potteries.=--Sir Henry Doulton, head of the Lambeth\r\npotteries, whose death, November 17, 1897, has been recorded in the\r\nMonthly, preferred devoting himself to the factory to engaging in the\r\nstudy of a learned profession for which his parents intended him, and\r\nhimself did much of the largest work produced there in the earlier\r\ndays of his connection with it. As the factory was enlarged, it made\r\ndrain pipes, vessels and appliances of stoneware for chemical and\r\nother similar uses, for which it gained prizes at the great\r\nexhibitions of 1851 and 1862; ale pots and mugs of traditional and\r\noriginal designs; terra-cotta vases; and first exhibited articles of\r\nhigher artistic merit at Paris in 1867. It showed a magnificent\r\ncollection at Vienna in 1873, and its exhibit at Philadelphia in 1876\r\nwas one of the marked features of our Centennial. The chief styles of\r\nits work are the ornamental salt-glazed stoneware known as Doulton\r\nware, and the underglaze-painted earthenware called \"Lambeth faïence.\"\r\nSir George Birdwood ascribes as the great merit of Sir Henry's life\r\nwork his adherence to the two principles of making, as far as\r\npossible, every piece intended for decoration on the wheel, and of\r\ngiving the utmost scope to the designer into whose hands the piece\r\nfell for ornamentation. Four hundred designers, mostly women, and some\r\nof them real artists, are engaged at the potteries, and each has her\r\nway and signs her name to her work; so that \"Sir Henry Doulton\r\nsucceeded in creating a most prolific school, or rather several\r\nschools, of English pottery, the influence of which has been felt in\r\nthe revival of the ceramic arts in all the countries of the Old\r\nWorld\"--where they had been demoralized by the use of machinery; and\r\nthrough the influence of his example, working since 1871, the United\r\nKingdom now produces \"the most artistic commercial pottery of any\r\ncountry in the world.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMINOR PARAGRAPHS.\r\n\r\nA little over a year ago Professor Fraser published the results of\r\nsome researches which showed that the bile of several animals\r\npossessed antidotal properties against serpents' venom, and against\r\nthe toxines of such diseases as diphtheria and tetanus, and that the\r\nbile of venomous serpents is an antidote to their venom. The results\r\nfrom an extension of these first experiments have been recently\r\npublished in the British Medical Journal. The most important\r\nconclusions are as follows: The bile of venomous serpents is the most\r\npowerful antidote to venom, and is closely followed in efficiency by\r\nthe bile of innocuous serpents. Regarding the antidotal power of bile\r\non the toxines of disease, Professor Fraser found that the bile of\r\nvenomous serpents had more antidotal power than that of the majority\r\nof the other animals examined. It is curious that among the\r\nnon-venomous animals the rabbit's bile is the most powerful in\r\nantidotal properties.\r\n\r\nThree ways are mentioned by Prof. W. A. Herdman in which disease may\r\nbe communicated through oysters to the consumer; viz., by the presence\r\nin the animal of inorganic, usually metallic, poison; or of organic\r\npoison; or of a pathological organism or definite disease germ. From\r\nexperiments in the inoculation and disinfection of oysters, it was\r\nfound that all traces of these organisms could be removed by proper\r\nwashing. Good currents passing the beds are an important factor in\r\nkeeping the oyster healthy, and make it possible for the animal to\r\nabsorb large quantities of sewage and dispose of it. The effect of\r\nthis is to purify the water; but in the sifting process, while the\r\nsewage is passing through, the animal retains disease germs, and may\r\npass them on to the consumer. Oysters should therefore be given an\r\nopportunity to purify themselves, as is done in France, where they are\r\nkept for a time in clean tanks before being sent to market. Oysters\r\nmay be effectively washed in fresh water. Sea water is unfavorable to\r\ndisease germs. Greenness in oysters is caused by food administered to\r\nimprove their quality; by the presence of copper; and in some American\r\noysters by an inflamed condition of the mantle. Green spots are also\r\nproduced by wandering cells getting under the epithelium. These cells\r\nare loaded with granules which give a copper reaction.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting result of the massacre and sack of Benin, the\r\nSaturday Review says, was the capture of a large series of brass\r\nplaques, statuettes, box lids, pipes, etc., which have been brought to\r\nEngland. The various articles are all castings, and their elaborate\r\nornamentation bespeaks for their makers great skill in metal working.\r\nMost African tribes have smiths who hammer pieces of brass rod and\r\nwire into simple ornaments; but these Benin brasses represent a stage\r\nof metal working far more advanced than anything recorded for the\r\nnative races of Africa. Nothing like them is being made by any negro\r\nrace at present, and nothing is known that can be regarded as a\r\nprecursor of them. A statuette in the Liverpool Museum of a negro\r\nholding a flint gun fixes their date as not earlier than about 1630.\r\nIn trying to account for them, many think they were due to the\r\ninfluence of some comparatively advanced tribe that reached Benin from\r\nthe central Soudan and brought with them a knowledge of brass work\r\nderived from early, possibly Egyptian, sources; and others attribute\r\nthe work to some prisoner or trader who lived at Benin in the\r\nseventeenth century.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES.\r\n\r\nThe Committee of the British Association on Meteorological Photography\r\nreported that the result of their determinations of the heights of\r\nclouds showed the existence of greater altitudes in hot weather under\r\nthunderstorm conditions, when clouds may occur at five or six\r\ndifferent levels, extending as high as ninety thousand feet. A rise of\r\ncloud takes place in hot weather, also during the morning and early\r\nafternoons, while the lowest altitudes are found during cyclones.\r\n\r\nM. Maige, by varying the condition of exposure of plants to light, and\r\nkeeping flowering branches in the dark, has succeeded in transforming\r\nthe latter into sterile creeping or climbing branches. Inversely, he\r\nhas been able, by means of the localized action of light, to transform\r\ncreeping or climbing into flowering branches. These results were\r\nobtained at the vegetable biological laboratory of Fontainebleau.\r\n\r\nF. L. Washburn, of the State University of Oregon, reports that the\r\ncondition of the Eastern oysters introduced to the Oregon coast waters\r\ntwo years ago leaves nothing to be desired. The specimens have\r\nwithstood two winters successfully, and have made phenomenal growth,\r\n\"far exceeding what they would have made in the same time in their\r\nnative waters. Further, they spawned.\" The experiments in artificial\r\nfertilization were not so successful. The spawn suffer from the\r\nserious difficulties of sudden variations in the temperature and\r\nsalinity of the water resulting from the change of tide and strong\r\nwinds. It is hoped that better conditions may be found at Yaquina Bay.\r\n\r\nThe population of Egypt has been gradually increasing during the past\r\nhundred years. It is stated to have been about two and a half million\r\nin 1800, and is now estimated at nearly ten million.
