Its function consists in\r\nisolating and separating the cells from their cortex, and in putting\r\nthem in direct contact with the rollers or cylinders of the mill.\r\nAfter their passage into the apparatus, which is naturally placed in a\r\nline with the endless chain that carries them to the mill, the canes\r\narrive in less compact layers, pass through much narrower spaces, and\r\nfinally undergo a more efficient pressure, which is shown by an\r\nabundant flow of juice. The first trials of the machine were made in\r\n1879 at the Pointe Simon Works, at Martinique, with the small type\r\nthat was shown at the Paris Exhibition of 1878. These experiments,\r\nwhich were applied to a work of 3,000 kilos of cane per hour, gave\r\nentire satisfaction, and decided the owners of three of the colonial\r\nworks (Pointe Simon, Larcinty, and Marin) to adopt it for the season\r\nof 1880.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus is shown in longitudinal section in Fig. 1, and in plan\r\nin Fig. 2.\r\n\r\nFig. 3 gives a transverse section passing through the line 3-4, and\r\nFig. 4 an external view on the side whence the decorticated canes make\r\ntheir exit from the apparatus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FAURE'S MACHINE FOR DECORTICATING SUGAR CANE.]\r\n\r\nThe other figures relate to details that will be referred to further\r\nalong.\r\n\r\n_The Decorticating Cylinder._--The principal part of the apparatus is\r\na hollow drum, A, of cast iron, 430 mm. in internal diameter by 1.41\r\nm. in length, which is keyed at its two extremities to the shaft, a.\r\nExternally, this drum (which is represented apart in transverse\r\nsection in Fig. 5) has the form of an octagonal prism with well\r\ndressed projections between which are fixed the eight plates, C, that\r\nconstitute the decorticating cylinder. These plates, which are of\r\ntempered cast iron, and one of which is shown in transverse section in\r\nFig. 7, when once in place form a cylindrical surface provided with 48\r\nhelicoidal, dentate channels. The length of these plates is 470 mm.\r\nThere are three of them in the direction of the generatrices of the\r\ncylinder, and this makes a total of 24. All are strengthened by ribs\r\n(as shown in Fig. 8), and each is fixed by 4 bolts, _c_, 20mm. in\r\ndiameter. The pitch of the helices of each tooth is very elongated,\r\nand reaches about 7.52 m. The depth of the toothing is 18 mm.\r\n\r\n_Frame and Endless Chain._--The cylinder thus constructed rotates with\r\na velocity of 50 revolutions per minute over a cylindrical vessel, B',\r\ncast in a piece with the frame, B. This vessel is lined with two\r\nseries of tempered cast iron plates, D and D', called exit and\r\nentrance plates, which rest thereon, through the intermedium of well\r\ndressed pedicels, and which are held in place by six 20-millimeter\r\nbolts. Their length is 708 mm. The entrance plates, D, are provided\r\nwith 6 spiral channels, whose pitch is equal to that of the channels\r\nof the decorticating cylinder, C, and in the same direction. The depth\r\nof the toothing is 10 mm.\r\n\r\nThe exit plates, D', are provided with 7 spiral channels of the same\r\npitch and direction as those of the preceding, but the depth of which\r\nincreases from 2 to 10 mm. The axis of the decorticating cylinder does\r\nnot coincide with that of the vessel, B', so that the free interval\r\nfor the passage of the cane continues to diminish from the entrance to\r\nthe exit.\r\n\r\nThe passage of the cane to the decorticator gives rise to a small\r\nquantity of juice, which flows through two orifices, _b'_, into a sort\r\nof cast iron trough, G, suspended beneath the vessel. The cane, which\r\nis brought to the apparatus by an endless belt, empties in a conduit\r\nformed of an inclined bottom, E, of plate iron, and two cast iron\r\nsides provided with ribs. These sides rest upon the two ends of the\r\nvessel, B', and are cross-braced by two flat bars, _e_, to which is\r\nbolted the bottom, E. This conduit is prolonged beyond the\r\ndecorticating cylinder by an inclined chute, F, the bottom of which is\r\nmade of plate iron 7 mm. thick and the sides of the same material 9\r\nmm. thick. The hollow frame, B, whose general form is like that of a\r\nsaddle, carries the bearings, _b_, in which revolves the shaft, _a_.\r\nOne of these bearings is represented in detail in Figs. 9 and 10. It\r\nwill be seen that the cap is held by bolts with sunken heads, and that\r\nthe bearing on the bushes is through horizontal surfaces only. In a\r\npiece with this frame are cast two similar brackets, B², which support\r\nthe axle, _h_, of the endless chain. To this axle, whose diameter is\r\n100 mm., are keyed, toward the extremities, the pinions, H, to which\r\ncorrespond the endless pitch chains, _i_. These latter are formed, as\r\nmay be seen in Figs. 11 and 12, of two series of links. The shorter of\r\nthese latter are only 100 mm. in length, while the longer are 210 mm.,\r\nand are hollowed out so as to receive the butts of the boards, I. The\r\nchain thus formed passes over two pitch pinions, J, like the pinions,\r\nH, that are mounted at the extremities of an axle, _j_, that revolves\r\nin bearings, I', whose position with regard to the apparatus is\r\ncapable of being varied so as to slacken or tauten the chain, I. This\r\narrangement is shown in elevation in Fig. 13.\r\n\r\n_Transmission._--The driving shaft, _k_, revolves in a pillow block,\r\nK, cast in a piece with the frame, B. It is usually actuated by a\r\nspecial motor, and carries a fly-wheel (not shown in the figure for\r\nwant of space). It receives in addition a cog-wheel, L, which\r\ntransmits its motion to the decorticating cylinder through, the\r\nintermedium of a large wooden-toothed gear wheel, L'. The shaft, _a_,\r\nwhose diameter is 228 mm., actuates in its turn, through the pinions,\r\nM' and M, the pitch pinion, N, upon whose prolonged hub is keyed the\r\npinion, M. This latter is mounted loosely upon the intermediate axle,\r\n_m_. Motion is transmitted to the driving shaft, _h_, of the endless\r\nchain, I, by an ordinary pitch chain, through a gearing which is shown\r\nin Fig. 12. The pitch pinion, N', is cast in a piece with a hollow\r\nfriction cone, N², which is mounted loosely upon the shaft, _h_, and\r\nto which corresponds a second friction cone, O. This latter is\r\nconnected by a key to a socket, _o_, upon which it slides, and which\r\nis itself keyed to the shaft, _h_. The hub of the cone, O, is\r\nconnected by a ring with a bronze nut, _p_, mounted at the threaded\r\nend of the shaft, _h_, and carrying a hand-wheel, P. It is only\r\nnecessary to turn this latter in one direction or the other in order\r\nto throw the two cones into or out of gear.\r\n\r\nIf we allow that the motor has a velocity of 70 revolutions per\r\nminute, the decorticating cylinder will run at the rate of 50, and the\r\nsugar-cane will move forward at the rate of 12 meters per minute.\r\n\r\nThis new machine is a very simple and powerful one. The decortication\r\nis effected with wonderful rapidity, and the canes, opened throughout\r\ntheir entire length and at all points of their circumference, leave\r\nthe apparatus in a state that allows of no doubt as to what the result\r\nof the pressure will be that they have to undergo. There is no\r\ntearing, no trituration, no loss of juice, but merely a simple\r\npreparation for a rational pressure effected under most favorable\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus, which is made in several sizes, has already received\r\nnumerous applications in Martinique, Trinidad, Cuba, Antigua, St.\r\nDomingo, Peru, Australia, the Mauritius Islands, and\r\nBrazil.--_Publication Industrielle._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMOVING A BRIDGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn interesting piece of engineering work has recently been\r\naccomplished at Bristol, England, which consisted in the moving of a\r\nfoot-bridge 134 feet in length, bodily, down the river a considerable\r\ndistance. The pontoons by means of which the bridge was floated to its\r\nnew position consisted of four 80-ton barges, braced together so as to\r\nform one solid structure 64 feet in width, and were placed in position\r\nsoon after the tide commenced to rise. At six o'clock A.M. the top of\r\nthe stages, which was 24 feet above the water, touched the under part\r\nof the bridge, and in a quarter of an hour later both ends rose from\r\ntheir foundations. When the tide had risen 4 ft. the stage and bridge\r\nwere floated to the new position, when at 8.30 the girders dropped on\r\nto their beds.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GENERATION OF STEAM, AND THE THERMODYNAMIC PROBLEMS\r\nINVOLVED.[1]\r\n\r\n   [Footnote 1: Lecture delivered at the Institution of Civil\r\n   Engineers, session 1883-84. For the illustrations we are indebted\r\n   to the courtesy of Mr. J. Forrest, the secretary.]\r\n\r\nBy Mr. WILLIAM ANDERSON, M.I.C.E.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will not be necessary to commence this lecture by explaining the\r\norigin of fuel; it will be sufficient if I remind you that it is to\r\nthe action of the complex rays of the sun upon the foliage of plants\r\nthat we mainly owe our supply of combustibles. The tree trunks and\r\nbranches of our forests, as well as the subterranean deposits of coal\r\nand naphtha, at one time formed portions of the atmosphere in the form\r\nof carbonic acid gas; that gas was decomposed by the energy of the\r\nsolar rays, the carbon and the oxygen were placed in positions of\r\nadvantage with respect to each other--endowed with potential energy;\r\nand it is my duty this evening to show how we can best make use of\r\nthese relations, and by once more combining the constituents of fuel\r\nwith the oxygen of the air, reverse the action which caused the growth\r\nof the plants, that is to say, by destroying the plant reproduce the\r\nheat and light which fostered it. The energy which can be set free by\r\nthis process cannot be greater than that derived originally from the\r\nsun, and which, acting through the frail mechanism of green leaves,\r\ntore asunder the strong bonds of chemical affinity wherein the carbon\r\nand oxygen were hound, converting the former into the ligneous\r\nportions of the plants and setting the latter free for other uses. The\r\npower thus silently exerted is enormous; for every ton of carbon\r\nseparated in twelve hours necessitates an expenditure of energy\r\nrepresented by at least 1,058 horse power, but the action is spread\r\nover an enormous area of leaf surface, rendered necessary by the small\r\nproportion of carbonic acid contained in the air, by measure only\r\n1/2000 part, and hence the action is silent and imperceptible. It is\r\nnow conceded on all hands that what is termed heat is the energy of\r\nmolecular motion, and that this motion is convertible into various\r\nkinds and obeys the general laws relating to motion. Two substances\r\nbrought within the range of chemical affinity unite with more or less\r\nviolence; the motion of transition of the particles is transformed,\r\nwholly or in part, into a vibratory or rotary motion, either of the\r\nparticles themselves or the interatomic ether; and according to the\r\nquality of the motions we are as a rule, besides other effects, made\r\nconscious of heat or light, or of both. When these emanations come to\r\nbe examined they are found to be complex in the extreme, intimately\r\nbound up together, and yet capable of being separated and analyzed.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the law of definite chemical combination was firmly\r\nestablished, the circumstance that changes of temperature accompanied\r\nmost chemical combinations was noticed, and chemists were not long in\r\nsuspecting that the amount of heat developed or absorbed by chemical\r\nreaction should be as much a property of the substances entering into\r\ncombination as their atomic weights. Solid ground for this expectation\r\nlies in the dynamic theory of heat. A body of water at a given height\r\nis competent by its fall to produce a definite and invariable quantity\r\nof heat or work, and in the same way two substances falling together\r\nin chemical union acquire a definite amount of kinetic energy, which,\r\nif not expended in the work of molecular changes, may also by suitable\r\narrangements be made to manifest a definite and invariable quantity of\r\nheat.\r\n\r\nAt the end of last century Lavoisier and Laplace, and after them, down\r\nto our own time, Dulong, Desprez, Favre and Silbermann, Andrews,\r\nBerthelot, Thomson, and others, devoted much time and labor to the\r\nexperimental determination of the heat of combustion and the laws\r\nwhich governed its development. Messrs. Favre and Silbermann, in\r\nparticular, between the years 1845 and 1852, carried out a splendid\r\nseries of experiments by means of the apparatus partly represented in\r\nFig. 1 (opposite), which is a drawing one-third the natural size of\r\nthe calorimeter employed. It consisted essentially of a combustion\r\nchamber formed of thin copper, gilt internally. The upper part of the\r\nchamber was fitted with a cover through which the combustible could be\r\nintroduced, with a pipe for a gas jet, with a peep hole closed by\r\nadiathermanous but transparent substances, alum and glass, and with a\r\nbranch leading to a thin copper coil surrounding the lower part of the\r\nchamber and descending below it. The whole of this portion of the\r\napparatus was plunged into a thin copper vessel, silvered internally\r\nand filled with water, which was kept thoroughly mixed by means of\r\nagitators. This second vessel stood inside a third one, the sides and\r\nbottom of which were covered with the skins of swans with the down on,\r\nand the whole was immersed in a fourth vessel tilled with water, kept\r\nat the average temperature of the laboratory. Suitable thermometers of\r\ngreat delicacy were provided, and all manner of precautions were taken\r\nto prevent loss of heat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GENERATION OF STEAM. Fig 1.]\r\n\r\nIt is impossible not to admire the ingenuity and skill exhibited in\r\nthe details of the apparatus, in the various accessories for\r\ngenerating and storing the gases used, and for absorbing and weighing\r\nthe products of combustion; but it is a matter of regret that the\r\nexperiments should have been carried out on so small a scale. For\r\nexample, the little cage which held the solid fuel tested was only 5/8\r\ninch diameter by barely 2 inches high, and held only 38 grains of\r\ncharcoal, the combustion occupying about sixteen minutes. Favre and\r\nSilbermann adopted the plan of ascertaining the weight of the\r\nsubstances consumed by calculation from the weight of the products of\r\ncombustion. Carbonic acid was absorbed by caustic potash, as also was\r\ncarbonic oxide, after having been oxidized to carbonic acid by heated\r\noxide of copper, and the vapor of water was absorbed by concentrated\r\nsulphuric acid. The adoption of this system showed that it was in any\r\ncase necessary to analyze the products of combustion in order to\r\ndetect imperfect action. Thus, in the case of substances containing\r\ncarbon, carbonic oxide was always present to a variable extent with\r\nthe carbonic acid, and corrections were necessary in order to\r\ndetermine the total heat due to the complete combination of the\r\nsubstance with oxygen. Another advantage gained was that the\r\nabsorption of the products of combustion prevents any sensible\r\nalteration in the volumes during the process, so that corrections for\r\nthe heat absorbed in the work of displacing the atmosphere were not\r\nrequired. The experiments on various substances were repeated many\r\ntimes. The mean results for those in which we are immediately\r\ninterested are given in Table I., next column.\r\n\r\nComparison with later determinations have established their\r\nsubstantial accuracy. The general conclusion arrived at is thus\r\nstated:\r\n\r\n\"As a rule there is an equality between the heat disengaged or\r\nabsorbed in the acts, respectively, of chemical combination or\r\ndecomposition of the same elements, so that the heat evolved during\r\nthe combination of two simple or com-pound substances is equal to the\r\nheat absorbed at the time of their chemical segregation.\"\r\n\r\n       TABLE I.--SUBSTANCES ENTERING INTO THE COMPOSITION OF FUEL.\r\n\r\n  -----------------------+-------------+-----------+-------------------+\r\n                         |                         | Heat evolved in   |\r\n                         |     Symbol and Atomic   |the Combustion of  |\r\n                         |           Weight.       |  1 lb. of Fuel.   |\r\n                         +------------+------------+--------+----------+\r\n                         |            |            |        |In Pounds |\r\n                         |            |            |  In    | of Water |\r\n                         |            |            |British |Evaporated|\r\n                         |   Before   |    After   |Thermal | from and |\r\n                         | Combustion | Combustion | Units. | at 212°. |\r\n                         +------------+------------+--------+----------+\r\n  Hydrogen burned        | H        1 | H2O     18 | 62,032 |  64.21   |\r\n    in oxygen.           |            |            |        |          |\r\n  -----------------------+------------+------------+--------+----------+\r\n  Carbon burned to       | C       12 | CO      28 |  4,451 |   4.61   |\r\n    carbonic oxide.      |            |            |        |          |\r\n  -----------------------+------------+------------+--------+----------+\r\n  Carbon burned to       | C       12 | CO2     44 | 14,544 |  15.06   |\r\n    carbonic acid.       |            |            |        |          |\r\n  -----------------------+------------+------------+--------+----------+\r\n  Carbonic oxide burned  | CO      28 | CO2     44 |  4,326 |   4.48   |\r\n    to carbonic acid.    |            |            |        |          |\r\n  -----------------------+------------+------------+--------+----------+\r\n  Olefiant gas (ethylene)| C2H4    28 | 2CO2   124 | 21,343 |  22.09   |\r\n    burnt in oxygen.     |            | 2H2O       |        |          |\r\n  -----------------------+------------+------------+--------+----------+\r\n  Marsh gas (methane)    | CH4     16 | 2CO2    80 | 23,513 |  24.34   |\r\n  burnt in oxygen.       |            | 2H2O       |        |          |\r\n  -----------------------+------------+------------+--------+----------+\r\n\r\nComposition of air--\r\n\r\n  by volume 0.788 N + 0.197 O + 0.001 CO2 + 0.014 H2O\r\n  ----------------------------------------------------\r\n  by weight 0.771 N + 0.218 O + 0.009 CO2 + 0.017 H2O\r\n\r\nThis law is, however, subject to some apparent exceptions. Carbon\r\nburned in protoxide of nitrogen, or laughing gas, N_{2}O, produces\r\nabout 38 per cent. more heat than the same substance burned in pure\r\noxygen, notwithstanding that the work of decomposing the protoxide of\r\nnitrogen has to be performed. In marsh gas, or methane, CH_{4}, again,\r\nthe energy of combustion is considerably less than that due to the\r\nburning of its carbon and hydrogen separately. These exceptions\r\nprobably arise from the circumstance that the energy of chemical\r\naction is absorbed to a greater or less degree in effecting molecular\r\nchanges, as, for example, the combustion of 1 pound of nitrogen to\r\nform protoxide of nitrogen results in the absorption of 1,157 units of\r\nheat. Berthelot states, as one of the fundamental principles of\r\nthermochemistry, \"that the quantity of heat evolved is the measure of\r\nthe sum of the chemical and physical work accomplished in the\r\nreaction\"; and such a law will no doubt account for the phenomena\r\nabove noted. The equivalent heat of combustion of the compounds we\r\nhave practically to deal with has been experimentally determined, and\r\ntherefore constitutes a secure basis on which to establish\r\ncalculations of the caloric value of fuel; and in doing so, with\r\nrespect to substances composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, it is\r\nconvenient to reduce the hydrogen to its heat-producing equivalent of\r\ncarbon. The heat of combustion of hydrogen being 62,032 units, that of\r\ncarbon 14,544 units, it follows that 4.265 times the weight of\r\nhydrogen will represent an equivalent amount of carbon. With respect\r\nto the oxygen, it is found that it exists in combination with the\r\nhydrogen in the form of water, and, being combined already, abstracts\r\nits combining equivalent of hydrogen from the efficient ingredients of\r\nthe fuel; and hence hydrogen, to the extent of 1/8 of the weight of\r\nthe oxygen, must be deducted. The general formula then becomes:\r\n\r\n       Heat of combustion = 14,544 {C + 4.265 (H-(O/8))},\r\n\r\nand water evaporated from and at 212°, taking 966 units as the heat\r\nnecessary to evaporate 1 pound of water,\r\n\r\n       lb. evaporated = 15.06 {C + 4.265 (H-(O/8))},\r\n\r\ncarbon, hydrogen, and oxygen being taken at their weight per cent. in\r\nthe fuel. Strictly speaking, marsh gas should be separately\r\ndetermined. It often happens that available energy is not in a form in\r\nwhich it can be applied directly to our needs. The water flowing down\r\nfrom the mountains in the neighborhood of the Alpine tunnels was\r\ncompetent to provide the power necessary for boring through them, but\r\nit was not in a form in which it could be directly applied. The\r\nkinetic energy of the water had first to be changed into the potential\r\nenergy of air under pressure, then, in that form, by suitable\r\nmechanism, it was used with signal success to disintegrate and\r\nexcavate the hard rock of the tunnels. The energy resulting from\r\ncombustion is also incapable of being directly transformed into useful\r\nmotive power; it must first be converted into potential force of steam\r\nor air at high temperature and pressure, and then applied by means of\r\nsuitable heat engines to produce the motions we require. It is\r\nprobably to this circumstance that we must attribute the slowness of\r\nthe human race to take advantage of the energy of combustion. The\r\nhistory of the steam engine hardly dates back 200 years, a very small\r\nfraction of the centuries during which man has existed, even since\r\nhistoric times.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus by means of which the potential energy of fuel with\r\nrespect to oxygen is converted into the potential energy of steam, we\r\ncall a steam boiler; and although it has neither cylinder nor piston,\r\ncrank nor fly wheel, I claim for it that it is a veritable heat\r\nengine, because it transmits the undulations and vibrations caused by\r\nthe energy of chemical combination in the fuel to the water in the\r\nboiler; these motions expend themselves in overcoming the liquid\r\ncohesion of the water and imparting to its molecules that vigor of\r\nmotion which converts them into the molecules of a gas which,\r\nimpinging on the surfaces which confine it and form the steam space,\r\ndeclare their presence and energy in the shape of pressure and\r\ntemperature. A steam pumping engine, which furnishes water under high\r\npressure to raise loads by means of hydraulic cranes, is not more\r\ntruly a heat engine than a simple boiler, for the latter converts the\r\nlatent energy of fuel into the latent energy of steam, just as the\r\npumping engine converts the latent energy of steam into the latent\r\nenergy of the pumped-up accumulator or the hoisted weight.\r\n\r\nIf I am justified in taking this view, then I am justified in applying\r\nto my heat engine the general principles laid down in 1824 by Sadi\r\nCarnot, namely, that the proportion of work which can be obtained out\r\nof any substance working between two temperatures depends entirely and\r\nsolely upon the difference between the temperatures at the beginning\r\nand end of the operation; that is to say, if T be the higher\r\ntemperature at the beginning, and _t_ the lower temperature at the end\r\nof the action, then the maximum possible work to be got out of the\r\nsubstance will be a function of (T-_t_). The greatest range of\r\ntemperature possible or conceivable is from the absolute temperature\r\nof the substance at the commencement of the operation down to absolute\r\nzero of temperature, and the fraction of this which can be utilized is\r\nthe ratio which the range of temperature through which the substance\r\nis working bears to the absolute temperature at the commencement of\r\nthe action. If W = the greatest amount of effect to be expected, T and\r\n_t_ the absolute temperatures, and H the total quantity of heat\r\n(expressed in foot pounds or in water evaporated, as the case may be)\r\npotential in the substance at the higher temperature, T, at the\r\nbeginning of the operation, then Carnot's law is expressed by the\r\nequation:\r\n\r\n         / T - t \\\r\n   W = H( ------- )\r\n         \\   T   /\r\n\r\nI will illustrate this important doctrine in the manner which Carnot\r\nhimself suggested.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GENERATION OF STEAM. Fig 2.]\r\n\r\nFig. 2 represents a hillside rising from the sea. Some distance up\r\nthere is a lake, L, fed by streams coming down from a still higher\r\nlevel. Lower down on the slope is a millpond, P, the tail race from\r\nwhich falls into the sea. At the millpond is established a factory,\r\nthe turbine driving which is supplied with water by a pipe descending\r\nfrom the lake, L. Datum is the mean sea level; the level of the lake\r\nis T, and of the millpond _t_. Q is the weight of water falling\r\nthrough the turbine per minute. The mean sea level is the lowest level\r\nto which the water can possibly fall; hence its greatest potential\r\nenergy, that of its position in the lake, = QT = H. The water is\r\nworking between the absolute levels, T and _t_; hence, according to\r\nCarnot, the maximum effect, W, to be expected is--\r\n\r\n         / T - t \\\r\n   W = H( ------- )\r\n         \\   T   /\r\n                                / T - t \\\r\nbut H = QT [therefore]  W = Q T( ------- )\r\n                                \\   T   /\r\n\r\n   W = Q (T - t),\r\n\r\nthat is to say, the greatest amount of work which can be expected is\r\nfound by multiplying the weight of water into the clear fall, which\r\nis, of course, self-evident.\r\n\r\nNow, how can the quantity of work to be got out of a given weight of\r\nwater be increased without in any way improving the efficiency of the\r\nturbine? In two ways:\r\n\r\n1. By collecting the water higher up the mountain, and by that means\r\nincreasing T.\r\n\r\n2. By placing the turbine lower down, nearer the sea, and by that\r\nmeans reducing _t_.\r\n\r\nNow, the sea level corresponds to the absolute zero of temperature,\r\nand the heights T and _t_ to the maximum and minimum temperatures\r\nbetween which the substance is working; therefore similarly, the way\r\nto increase the efficiency of a heat engine, such as a boiler, is to\r\nraise the temperature of the furnace to the utmost, and reduce the\r\nheat of the smoke to the lowest possible point. It should be noted, in\r\naddition, that it is immaterial what liquid there may be in the lake;\r\nwhether water, oil, mercury, or what not, the law will equally apply,\r\nand so in a heat engine, the nature of the working substance, provided\r\nthat it does not change its physical state during a cycle, does not\r\naffect the question of efficiency with which the heat being expended\r\nis so utilized. To make this matter clearer, and give it a practical\r\nbearing, I will give the symbols a numerical value, and for this\r\npurpose I will, for the sake of simplicity, suppose that the fuel used\r\nis pure carbon, such as coke or charcoal, the heat of combustion of\r\nwhich is 14,544 units, that the specific heat of air, and of the\r\nproducts of combustion at constant pressure, is 0.238, that only\r\nsufficient air is passed through the fire to supply the quantity of\r\noxygen theoretically required for the combustion of the carbon, and\r\nthat the temperature of the air is at 60° Fahrenheit = 520° absolute.\r\nThe symbol T represents the absolute temperature of the furnace, a\r\nvalue which is easily calculated in the following manner: 1 lb. of\r\ncarbon requires 2-2/3 lb. of oxygen to convert it into carbonic acid,\r\nand this quantity is furnished by 12.2 lb. of air, the result being\r\n13.2 lb. of gases, heated by 14,544 units of heat due to the energy of\r\ncombustion; therefore:\r\n\r\n                14,544 units\r\n  T = 520° + ------------------ = 5,150° absolute.\r\n              13.2 lb. X 0.238\r\n\r\nThe lower temperature, _t_, we may take as that of the feed water, say\r\nat 100° or 560° absolute, for by means of artificial draught and\r\nsufficiently extending the heating surface, the temperature of the\r\nsmoke may be reduced to very nearly that of the feed water. Under such\r\ncircumstances the proportion of heat which can be realized is\r\n\r\n       5,150° - 560°\r\n    = --------------- = 0.891;\r\n           5,150°\r\n\r\nthat is to say, under the extremely favorable if not impracticable\r\nconditions assumed, there must be a loss of 11 per cent. Next, to give\r\na numerical value to the potential energy, H, to be derived from a\r\npound of carbon, calculating from absolute zero, the specific heat of\r\ncarbon being 0.25, and absolute temperature of air 520°:\r\n\r\n                                              Units.\r\n  1 lb. of carbon X 0.25 X 520              =    130\r\n  12.2 of air X 0.238 X 520                 =  1,485\r\n  Heat of combustion                        = 14,544\r\n                                              ------\r\n                                              16,159\r\n  Deduct heat equivalent to work of       \\\r\n    displacing atmosphere by products of   }\r\n    combustion raised from 60° to 100°,    }      32\r\n    or from 149.8 cubic feet to 161.3      }\r\n    cubic feet,                           /\r\n                                              ------\r\n          Total units of heat available       16,127\r\n\r\nEqual to 16.69 lb. of water evaporated from and at 212°. Hence the\r\ngreatest possible evaporation from and at 212° from a lb. of carbon--\r\n\r\n       16,159 u. X 0.891 - 32 u.\r\n  W = --------------------------- = 14.87 lb.\r\n               966 u.\r\n\r\nI will now take a definite case, and compare the potential energy of a\r\ncertain kind of fuel with the results actually obtained. For this\r\npurpose the boiler of the eight-horse portable engine, which gained\r\nthe first prize at the Cardiff show of the Royal Agricultural Society\r\nin 1872, will serve very well, because the trials, all the details of\r\nwhich are set forth very fully in vol. ix. of the _Journal_ of the\r\nSociety, were carried out with great care and skill by Sir Frederick\r\nBramwell and the late Mr. Menelaus; indeed, the only fact left\r\nundetermined was the temperature of the furnace, an omission due to\r\nthe want of a trustworthy pyrometer, a want which has not been\r\nsatisfied to this day.[2]\r\n\r\n   [Footnote 2: In the fifty-second volume of the _Proceedings_\r\n   (1887-78), page 154, will be found a remarkable experiment on the\r\n   evaporative power of a vertical boiler with internal circulating\r\n   pipes.

This\r\nwould make 18 lb. of air per 1 lb. of coal; consequently 19 lb. of\r\ngases would be heated by 14,727 units of heat. Hence:\r\n\r\n         14,727 u.\r\n  T = ---------------- = 3,257°\r\n       19 lb. × 0.238\r\n\r\nabove the temperatures of the air, or 3,777° absolute.

The rate of transfer of heat from the furnace\r\nto the water in the boiler, at any given point, is some way\r\nproportional to the difference of temperature, and the quantity of\r\nheat in the gases is proportional to their temperatures. Draw a base\r\nline representing -460° Fahr., the absolute zero of temperature. At\r\none end erect an ordinate, upon which set off T = 3,777°, the\r\ntemperature of the furnace. At 849° = _t_, on the scale of\r\ntemperature, draw a line parallel to the base, and mark on it a length\r\nproportional to the heating surface of the boiler; join T by a\r\ndiagonal with the extremity of this line, and drop a perpendicular on\r\nto the zero line. The temperature of the water in the boiler being\r\nuniform, the ordinates bounded by the sloping line, and by the line,\r\n_t_, will at any point be approximately proportional to the rate of\r\ntransmission of heat, and the shaded area above _t_ will be\r\nproportional to the quantity of heat imparted to the water. Join T by\r\nanother diagonal with extremity of the heating surface on the zero\r\nline, then the larger triangle, standing on the zero line, will\r\nrepresent the whole of the heat of combustion, and the ratio of the\r\ntwo triangles will be as the lengths of their respective bases, that\r\nis, as (T - _t_) / T, which is the expression we have already used. The\r\nheating surface was 220 square feet, and it was competent to transmit\r\nthe energy developed by 41 lb. of coal consumed per hour = 12,819 u. ×\r\n41 u. = 525,572 units, equal to an average of 2,389 units per square\r\nfoot per hour; this value will correspond to the mean pressure in an\r\nordinary diagram, for it is a measure of the energy with which\r\nmolecular motion is transferred from the heated gases to the\r\nboiler-plate, and so to the water. The mean rate of transmission,\r\nmultiplied by the area of heating surface, gives the area of the\r\nshaded portion of the figure, which is the total work which should\r\nhave been done, that is to say, the work of evaporating 544 lb. of\r\nwater per hour. The actual work done, however, was only 485 lb. To\r\ngive the speculations we have indulged in a practical turn, it will be\r\nnecessary to examine in detail the terms of Carnot's formula. Carnot\r\nlabored under great disadvantages. He adhered to the emission theory\r\nof heat; he was unacquainted with its dynamic equivalent; he did not\r\nknow the reason of the difference between the specific heat of air at\r\nconstant pressure and at constant volume, the idea of an absolute zero\r\nof temperature had not been broached; but the genius of the man, while\r\nit made him lament the want of knowledge which he felt must be\r\nattainable, also enabled him to penetrate the gloom by which he was\r\nsurrounded, and enunciate propositions respecting the theory of heat\r\nengines, which the knowledge we now possess enables us to admit as\r\ntrue. His propositions are:\r\n\r\n1. The motive power of heat is independent of the agents employed to\r\ndevelop it, and its quantity is determined solely by the temperature\r\nof the bodies between which the final transfer of caloric takes place.\r\n\r\n2. The temperature of the agent must in the first instance be raised\r\nto the highest degree possible in order to obtain a great fall of\r\ncaloric, and as a consequence a large production of motive power.\r\n\r\n3. For the same reason the cooling of the agent must be carried to as\r\nlow a degree as possible.\r\n\r\n4. Matters must be so arranged that the passage of the elastic agent\r\nfrom the higher to the lower temperature must be due to an increase of\r\nvolume, that is to say, the cooling of the agent must be caused by its\r\nrarefaction.\r\n\r\nThis last proposition indicates the defective information which Carnot\r\npossessed. He knew that expansion of the elastic agent was accompanied\r\nby a fall of temperature, but he did not know that that fall was due\r\nto the conversion of heat into work. We should state this clause more\r\ncorrectly by saying that \"the cooling of the agent must be caused by\r\nthe external work it performs.\" In accordance with these propositions,\r\nit is immaterial what the heated gases or vapors in the furnace of a\r\nboiler may be, provided that they cool by doing external work and, in\r\npassing over the boiler surfaces, impart their heat energy to the\r\nwater. The temperature of the furnace, it follows, must be kept as\r\nhigh as possible. The process of combustion is usually complex. First,\r\nin the case of coal, close to the fire-bars complete combustion of the\r\nred hot carbon takes place, and the heat so developed distills the\r\nvolatile hydrocarbons and moisture in the upper layers of the fuel.\r\nThe inflammable gases ignite on or near the surface of the fuel, if\r\nthere be a sufficient supply of air, and burn with a bright flame for\r\na considerable distance around the boiler. If the layer of fuel be\r\nthin, the carbonic acid formed in the first instance passes through\r\nthe fuel and mixes with the other gases. If, however, the layer of\r\nfuel be thick, and the supply of air through the bars insufficient,\r\nthe carbonic acid is decomposed by the red hot coke, and twice the\r\nvolume of carbonic oxide is produced, and this, making its way through\r\nthe fuel, burns with a pale blue flame on the surface, the result, as\r\nfar as evolution of heat is concerned, being the same as if the\r\nintermediate decomposition of carbonic acid had not taken place. This\r\nproperty of coal has been taken advantage of by the late Sir W.\r\nSiemens in his gas producer, where the supply of air is purposely\r\nlimited, in order that neither the hydrocarbons separated by\r\ndistillation, nor the carbonic oxide formed in the thick layer of\r\nfuel, may be consumed in the producer, but remain in the form of crude\r\ngas, to be utilized in his regenerative furnaces.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GENERATION OF STEAM.

MACCORD, Sc.D.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLANETARY WHEEL TRAINS. Fig. 14]\r\n\r\nIt has already been shown that the rotations of all the wheels of a\r\nplanetary train, relatively to the train-arm, are the same when the\r\narm is in motion as they would be if it were fixed. Now, in Fig. 14,\r\nlet A be the first and F the last wheel of an _incomplete_ train, that\r\nis, one having but one sun-wheel. As before, let these be so connected\r\nby intermediate gearing that, when T is stationary, a rotation of A\r\nthrough _m_ degrees shall drive F through _n_ degrees: and also as\r\nbefore, let T in the same time move through _a_ degrees. Then, if _m'_\r\nrepresent the total motion of A, we have again,\r\n\r\n       m' = m + a, or m = m' - a.\r\n\r\nThis is, clearly, the motion of A relatively to the fixed frame of the\r\nmachine; and is measured from a fixed vertical line through the\r\ncenter of A. Now, if we wish to express the total motion of F\r\nrelatively to the same fixed frame, we must measure it from a vertical\r\nline through the center of F, wherever that maybe; which gives in this\r\ncase:\r\n\r\n      n' = n + a, or n = n' - a.\r\n\r\nbut with respect to the train-arm when at rest, we have:\r\n\r\n      ang. vel. A     n\r\n      ------------ = ---, whence again\r\n      ang. vel. F     m\r\n\r\n        n' - a     n\r\n        ------ = --- .\r\n        m' - a     m\r\n\r\nThis is the manner in which the equation is deduced by Prof. Willis,\r\nwho expressly states that it applies whether the last wheel F is or is\r\nnot concentric with the first wheel A, and also that the train may be\r\ncomposed of any combinations which transmit rotation with both a\r\nconstant velocity ratio and a constant directional relation. He\r\ndesignates the quantities _m'_, _n'_, _absolute revolutions_, as\r\ndistinguished from the _relative revolutions_ (that is, revolutions\r\nrelatively to the train-arm), indicated by the quantities _m_, _n_:\r\nadding, \"Hence it appears that the absolute revolutions of the wheels\r\nof epicyclic trains are equal to the sum of their relative revolutions\r\nto the arm, and of the arm itself, when they take place in the same\r\ndirection, and equal to the difference of these revolutions when in\r\nthe opposite direction.\"\r\n\r\nIn this deduction of the formula, as in that of Prof. Rankine, all the\r\nmotions are supposed to have the same direction, corresponding to that\r\nof the hands of the clock; and in its application to any given train,\r\nthe signs of the terms must be changed in case of any contrary motion,\r\nas explained in the preceding article.\r\n\r\nAnd both the deduction and the application, in reference to these\r\nincomplete trains in which the last wheel is carried by the\r\ntrain-arm, clearly involve and depend upon the resolving of a motion\r\nof revolution into the components of a circular translation and a\r\nrotation, in the manner previously discussed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLANETARY WHEEL TRAINS. Fig. 15]\r\n\r\nTo illustrate: Take the simple case of two equal wheels, Fig. 15, of\r\nwhich the central one A is fixed. Supposing first A for the moment\r\nreleased and the arm to be fixed, we see that the two wheels will turn\r\nin opposite directions with equal velocities, which gives _n_/_m_ = -1;\r\nbut when A is fixed and T revolves, we have _m'_ = 0, whence in the\r\ngeneral formula\r\n\r\n  n' - a\r\n  ------   = -1, or n' = 2 a;\r\n    -a\r\n\r\nwhich means, being interpreted, that F makes two rotations about its\r\naxis during one revolution of T, and in the same direction. Again, let\r\nA and F be equal in the 3-wheel train, Fig. 16, the former being fixed\r\nas before. In this case we have:\r\n\r\n   n\r\n  --- = 1, m' = 0, which gives\r\n   m\r\n\r\n   n' - a\r\n  ------- = 1, [therefore] n' = 0;\r\n    -a\r\n\r\nthat is to say, the wheel F, which now evidently has a motion of\r\ncircular translation, does not rotate at all about its axis during the\r\nrevolution of the train-arm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLANETARY WHEEL TRAINS. Fig. 16]\r\n\r\nAll this is perfectly consistent, clearly, with the hypothesis that\r\nthe motion of circular translation is a simple one, and the motion of\r\nrevolution about a fixed axis is a compound one.\r\n\r\nWhether the hypothesis was made to substantiate the formula, or the\r\nformula constructed to suit the hypothesis, is not a matter of\r\nconsequence. In either case, no difficulty will arise so long as the\r\nequation is applied only to cases in which, as in those here\r\nmentioned, that motion of revolution _can_ be resolved into those\r\ncomponents.\r\n\r\nWhen the definition of an epicyclic train is restricted as it is by\r\nProf. Rankine, the consideration of the hypothesis in question is\r\nentirely eliminated, and whether it be accepted or rejected, the whole\r\nmatter is reduced to merely adding the motion of the train-arm to the\r\nrotation of each sun-wheel.\r\n\r\nBut in attempting to apply this formula in analyzing the action of an\r\nincomplete train, we are required to add this motion of the train-arm,\r\nnot only to that of a sun-wheel, but to that of a planet-wheel. This\r\nis evidently possible in the examples shown in Figs. 15 and 16,\r\nbecause the motions to be added are in all respects similar: the\r\ntrains are composed of spur-wheels, and the motions, whether of\r\nrevolution, translation, or rotation, _take place in parallel planes\r\nperpendicular to parallel axes_. This condition, which we have\r\nemphasized, be it observed, must hold true with regard to the motions\r\nof the first and last wheels and the train-arm, in order to make this\r\naddition possible. It is not essential that spur-wheels should be used\r\nexclusively or even at all; for instance, in Fig. 16, A and F may be\r\nmade bevel or screw-wheels, without affecting the action or the\r\nanalysis; but the train-arm in all cases revolves around the central\r\naxis of the system, that is, about the axis of A, and to this the axis\r\nof F _must_ be parallel, in order to render the deduction of the\r\nformula, as made by Prof. Willis, and also by Prof. Goodeve, correct,\r\nor even possible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLANETARY WHEEL TRAINS. Fig. 17]\r\n\r\nThis will be seen by an examination of Fig. 17; in which A and B are\r\ntwo equal spur-wheels, E and F two equal bevel wheels, B and E being\r\nsecured to the same shaft, and A being fixed to the frame H. As the\r\narm T goes round, B will also turn in its bearings in the same\r\ndirection: let this direction be that of the clock, when the apparatus\r\nis viewed from above, then the motion of F will also have the same\r\ndirection, when viewed from the central vertical axis, as shown at F':\r\nand let these directions be considered as positive. It is perfectly\r\nclear that F will turn in its bearings, in the direction indicated, at\r\na rate precisely equal to that of the train-arm. Let P be a pointer\r\ncarried by F, and R a dial fixed to T; and let the pointer be vertical\r\nwhen OO is the plane containing the axes of A, B, and E. Then, when F\r\nhas gone through any angle a measured from OO, the pointer will have\r\nturned from its original vertical position through an equal angle, as\r\nshown also at F'.\r\n\r\nNow, there is no conceivable sense in which the motion of T can be\r\nsaid to be added to the rotation of F about its axis, and the\r\nexpression \"absolute revolution,\" as applied to the motion of the last\r\nwheel in this train, is absolutely meaningless.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Prof. Goodeve states (Elements of Mechanism, p. 165)\r\nthat \"We may of course apply the general formula in the case of bevel\r\nwheels just as in that of spur wheels.\" Let us try the experiment;\r\nwhen the train-arm is stationary, and A released and turned to the\r\nright, F turns to the left at the same rate, whence:\r\n\r\n    n\r\n   --- = -1; also m' = 0 when A is fixed,\r\n    m\r\n\r\nand the equation becomes\r\n\r\n  n' - a\r\n  ------ = -1, [therefore] n' = 2a:\r\n   - a\r\n\r\nor in other words F turns _twice_ on its axis during one revolution of\r\nT: a result too palpably absurd to require any comment. We have seen\r\nthat this identical result was obtained in the case of Fig. 15, and it\r\nwould, of course, be the same were the formula applied to Figs. 5 and\r\n6; whereas it has never, so far as we are aware, been pretended that a\r\nmiter or a bevel wheel will make more than one rotation about its axis\r\nin rolling once around an equal fixed one.\r\n\r\nAgain, if the formula be general, it should apply equally well to a\r\ntrain of screw wheels: let us take, for example, the single pair shown\r\nin Fig. 8, of which, when T is fixed, the velocity ratio is unity. The\r\ndirectional relation, however, depends upon the direction in which the\r\nwheels are twisted: so that in applying the formula, we shall have\r\n_n/m_ = +1, if the helices of both wheels are right handed, and\r\n_n_/_m_ = -1, if they are both left handed. Thus the formula leads to\r\nthe surprising conclusion, that when A is fixed and T revolves, the\r\nplanet-wheel B will revolve about its axis twice as fast as T moves,\r\nin one case, while in the other it will not revolve at all.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLANETARY WHEEL TRAINS. Fig. 18]\r\n\r\nA favorite illustration of the peculiarities of epicyclic mechanism,\r\nintroduced both by Prof. Willis and Prof. Goodeve, is found in the\r\ncontrivance known as Ferguson's Mechanical Paradox, shown in Fig. 18.\r\nThis consists of a fixed sun-wheel A, engaging with a planet-wheel B\r\nof the same diameter. Upon the shaft of B are secured the three thin\r\nwheels E, G, I, each having 20 teeth, and in gear with the three\r\nothers F, H, K, which turn freely upon a stud fixed in the train-arm,\r\nand have respectively 19, 20, and 21 teeth. In applying the general\r\nformula, we have the following results:\r\n\r\n                    n     20     n' - a                         1\r\n  For the wheel F, --- = ---- = ---------, [therefore] n' = - ---- a.\r\n                    m     19       -a                          19\r\n\r\n                    n         n' - a\r\n   \"   \"    \"   H, --- = 1 = --------, [therefore] n' = 0.\r\n                    m           -a\r\n\r\n                    n     20     n' - a                         1\r\n   \"   \"    \"   K, --- = ---- = ---------, [therefore] n' = + ---- a.\r\n                    m     21       -a                          21\r\n\r\nThe paradoxical appearance, then, consists in this, that although the\r\ndrivers of the three last wheels each have the same number of teeth,\r\nyet the central one, H, having a motion of circular translation,\r\nremains always parallel to itself, and relatively to it the upper one\r\nseems to turn in the same direction as the train-arm, and the lower in\r\nthe contrary direction. And the appearance is accepted, too, as a\r\nreality; being explained, agreeably to the analysis just given, by\r\nsaying that H has no absolute rotation about its axis, while the other\r\nwheels have; that of F being positive and that of K negative.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLANETARY WHEEL TRAINS. Fig. 18]\r\n\r\nThe Mechanical Paradox, it is clear, may be regarded as composed of\r\nthree separate trains, each of which is precisely like that of Fig.\r\n16: and that, again, differs from the one of Fig. 15 only in the\r\naddition of a third wheel. Now, we submit that the train shown in Fig.\r\n17 is mechanically equivalent to that of Fig. 15; the velocity ratio\r\nand the directional relation being the same in both. And if in Fig. 17\r\nwe remove the index P, and fix upon its shaft three wheels like E, G,\r\nand I of Fig. 18, we shall have a combination mechanically equivalent\r\nto Ferguson's Paradox, the three last wheels rotating in vertical\r\nplanes about horizontal axes. The relative motions of those three\r\nwheels will be the same, obviously, as in Fig. 18; and according to\r\nthe formula their absolute motions are the same, and we are invited to\r\nperceive that the central one does not rotate at all about its axis.\r\n\r\nBut it _does_ rotate, nevertheless; and this unquestioned fact is of\r\nitself enough to show that there is something wrong with the formula\r\nas applied to trains like those in question. What that something is,\r\nwe think, has been made clear by what precedes; since it is impossible\r\nin any sense to add together motions which are unlike, it will be seen\r\nthat in order to obtain an intelligible result in cases like these,\r\nthe equation must be of the form _n'_/(_m'_ - _a_) = _n_/_m_. We shall\r\nthen have:\r\n\r\n                    n     20     n'                       20\r\n  For the wheel F, --- = ---- = ----, [therefore] n' = - ---- a;\r\n                    m     19     -a                       19\r\n\r\n                    n         n'\r\n  For the wheel H, --- = 1 = ----, [therefore] n' = -a;\r\n                    m         -a\r\n\r\n                    n     20     n'                       20\r\n  For the wheel K, --- = ---- = ----, [therefore] n' = - ---- a,\r\n                    m     21     -a                       21\r\n\r\nwhich corresponds with the actual state of things; all three wheels\r\nrotate in the same direction, the central one at the same rate as the\r\ntrain arm, one a little more rapidly and the third a little more\r\nslowly.\r\n\r\nIt is, then, absolutely necessary to make this modification in the\r\ngeneral formula, in order to apply it in determining the rotations of\r\nany wheel of an epicyclic train whose axis is not parallel to that of\r\nthe sun-wheels. And in this modified form it applies equally well to\r\nthe original arrangement of Ferguson's paradox, if we abandon the\r\nartificial distinction between \"absolute\" and \"relative\" rotations of\r\nthe planet-wheels, and regard a spur-wheel, like any other, as\r\nrotating on its axis when it turns in its bearings; the action of the\r\ndevice shown in Fig. 18 being thus explained by saying that the wheel\r\nH turns once backward during each forward revolution of the train-arm,\r\nwhile F turns a little more and K a little less than once, in the same\r\ndirection. In this way the classification and analysis of these\r\ncombinations are made more simple and consistent, and the\r\nincongruities above pointed out are avoided; since, without regard to\r\nthe kind of gearing employed or the relative positions of the axes, we\r\nhave the two equations:\r\n\r\n       n' - a     n\r\n   I. -------- = ---, for all complete trains;\r\n       m' - a     m\r\n\r\n          n'      n\r\n  II. -------- = ---, for all incomplete trains.\r\n       m' - a     m\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLANETARY WHEEL TRAINS. Fig. 19]\r\n\r\nAs another example of the difference in the application of these\r\nformulæ, let us take Watt's sun and planet wheels, Fig. 19. This\r\ndevice, as is well known, was employed by the illustrious inventor as\r\na substitute for the crank, which some one had succeeded in patenting.\r\nIt consists merely of two wheels A and F connected by the link T; A\r\nbeing keyed on the shaft of the engine and F being rigidly secured to\r\nthe connecting-rod. Suppose the rod to be of infinite length, so as to\r\nremain always parallel to itself, and the two wheels to be of equal\r\nsize.\r\n\r\nThen, according to Prof. Willis' analysis, we shall have--\r\n\r\n    n' - a     n                               -s\r\n   -------- = --- = -1, n' = 0, [therefore] -------- = -1, whence\r\n    m' - a     m                              m' - a\r\n\r\n          -a = a - m', or m = 2a.\r\n\r\nThe other view of the question is, that F turns once backward in its\r\nbearings during each forward revolution of T; whence in Eq. 2 we\r\nhave--\r\n\r\n       n'      n\r\n   -------- = --- = -1, n' = -a,\r\n    m' - a     m\r\n\r\n                 -a\r\n  [therefore] -------- -1, which gives -a = a - m', or m' = 2a,\r\n               m' - a\r\n\r\nas before.\r\n\r\nIt is next to be remarked, that the errors which arise from applying\r\nEq. I. to incomplete trains may in some cases counterbalance and\r\nneutralize each other, so that the final result is correct.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLANETARY WHEEL TRAINS. Fig. 20]\r\n\r\nFor example, take the combination shown in Fig. 20. This consists of a\r\ntrain-arm T revolving about the vertical axis OO of the fixed wheel A,\r\nwhich is equal in diameter to F, which receives its motion by the\r\nintervention of one idle wheel carried by a stud S fixed in the arm.\r\nThe second train-arm T' is fixed to the shaft of F and turns with it;\r\nA' is secured to the arm T, and F' is actuated by A' also through a\r\nsingle idler carried by T'.\r\n\r\nWe have here a compound train, consisting of two simple planetary\r\ntrains, A--F and A'--F'; and its action is to be determined by\r\nconsidering them separately. First suppose T' to be removed and find\r\nthe motion of F; next suppose F to be removed and T fixed, and find\r\nthe rotation of F'; and finally combine these results, noting that the\r\nmotion of T' is the same as that of F, and the motion of A' the same\r\nas that of T.\r\n\r\nThen, according to the analysis of Prof. Willis, we shall have\r\n(substituting the symbol _t_ for _a_ in the equation of the second\r\ntrain, in order to avoid confusion):\r\n\r\n                  n         n' - a\r\n  1. Train A--F. --- = 1 = --------; m' = 0,\r\n                  m         m' - a\r\n\r\n                            n' - a\r\n      whence               -------- = 1, n' = 0, = rot. of F.\r\n                               a\r\n\r\n                    n         n' - t\r\n  2. Train A'--F'. --- = 1 = --------; m' = 0,\r\n                    m         m' - t\r\n\r\n                              n' - t\r\n     whence again           -------- = 1, t = 0, = rot. of F'.\r\n                                -t\r\n\r\nOf these results, the first is explicable as being the _absolute_\r\nrotation of F, but the second is not; and it will be readily seen that\r\nthe former would have been equally absurd, had the axis LL been\r\ninclined instead of vertical. But in either case we should find the\r\nerrors neutralized upon combining the two, for according to the theory\r\nnow under consideration, the wheel A', being fixed to T, turns once\r\nupon its axis each time that train arm revolves, and in the same\r\ndirection; and the revolutions of T' equal the rotations of F, whence\r\nfinally in train A'--F' we have:\r\n\r\n      n         n' - t\r\n  3. --- = 1 = --------; in which t = 0, m' = a,\r\n      m         m' - t\r\n\r\n                n' - 0\r\nwhich gives    --------- = 1, or n' = a.\r\n                 a - 0\r\n\r\nThis is, unquestionably, correct; and indeed it is quite obvious that\r\nthe effect upon F' is the same, whether we say that during a\r\nrevolution of T the wheel A' turns once forward and T' not at all, or\r\nadopt the other view and assert that T' turns once backward and A' not\r\nat all. But the latter view has the advantage of giving concordant\r\nresults when the trains are considered separately, and that without\r\nregard to the relative positions of the axes or the kind of gearing\r\nemployed. Analyzing the action upon this hypothesis, we have:\r\n\r\n  In train A--F:\r\n\r\n    n            n'                         n'\r\n   --- = 1 = --------; m' = 0, [therefore] ---- = 1, or n' = -a;\r\n    m         m' - a                        -a\r\n\r\n  In train A'--F':\r\n\r\n    n'           n'                         n'\r\n   --- = 1 = --------; m' = 0, [therefore] ---- = 1, or n' = -t;\r\n    m         m' - t                       -t\r\n\r\nIn combining, we have in the latter train m' = 0, t = -a, whence\r\n\r\n    n           n'           n'\r\n   --- = 1 = -------- gives ---- = 1, or n' = a, as before.\r\n    m         m' - t         +a\r\n\r\nNow it happens that the only examples given by Prof. Willis of\r\nincomplete trains in which the axis of a planet-wheel whose motion is\r\nto be determined is not parallel to the central axis of the system,\r\nare similar to the one just discussed; the wheel in question being\r\ncarried by a secondary train-arm which derives its motion from a wheel\r\nof the primary train.\r\n\r\nThe application of his general equation in these cases gives results\r\nwhich agree with observed facts; and it would seem that this\r\ncircumstance, in connection doubtless with the complexity of these\r\ncompound trains, led him to the too hasty conclusion that the formula\r\nwould hold true in all cases; although we are still left to wonder at\r\nhis overlooking the fact that in these very cases the \"absolute\" and\r\nthe \"relative\" rotations of the last wheel are identical.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLANETARY WHEEL TRAINS. Fig. 21]\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 21 is shown a combination consisting also of two distinct\r\ntrains, in which, however, there is but one train-arm T turning freely\r\nupon the horizontal shaft OO, to which shaft the wheels A', F, are\r\nsecured; the train-arm has two studs, upon which turn the idlers B B',\r\nand also carries the bearings of the last wheel F'; the first wheel A\r\nis annular, and fixed to the frame of the machine. Let it be required\r\nto determine the results of one revolution of the crank H, the numbers\r\nof teeth being assigned as follows:\r\n\r\n      A = 60, F = 30, A' = 60, F' = 10.\r\n\r\nWe shall then have, for the train ABF (Eq. I.),\r\n\r\n      n       60          n' - a\r\n     --- = - ---- = -2 = --------, in which n' = 1, m' = 0,\r\n      m       30          m' - a'\r\n\r\n             1 - a                            1\r\nwhence -2 = -------, 2a = 1 - a, 3a = 1, a = ---.\r\n               -a                             3\r\n\r\nAnd for the train A'B'F' (Eq. II.),\r\n\r\n      n     60           n'                   1\r\n     --- = ---- = 6 = --------, in which a = ---, m' = 1,\r\n      m     10         m' - a'                3\r\n\r\n                           n'\r\nwhence            6 = -----------, or n' = 4.\r\n                       1 - (1/3)\r\n\r\nThat is, the last wheel F' turns _four_ times about the axis LL during\r\none revolution of the crank H. But according to Profs. Willis and\r\nGoodeve, we should have for the second train:\r\n\r\n      n     60         n' - a                 1\r\n     --- = ---- = 6 = --------, in which a = ---, m' = 1,\r\n      m     10         m' - a'                3\r\n\r\n                n' - (1/3)\r\nwhich gives 6 = -----------, n' - (1/3) = 4, n' = 4-1/3,\r\n                 1 - (1/3)\r\n\r\nor _four and one-third_ revolutions of F' for one of H.\r\n\r\nThis result, no doubt, might be near enough to the truth to serve all\r\npractical purposes in the application of this mechanism to its\r\noriginal object, which was that of paring apples, impaled upon the\r\nfork K; but it can hardly be regarded as entirely satisfactory in a\r\ngeneral way; nor can the analysis which renders such a result\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PANTANEMONE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe need of irrigating prairies, inundating vines, drying marshes, and\r\naccumulating electricity cheaply has, for some time past, led to a\r\nsearch for some means of utilizing the forces of nature better than\r\nhas ever hitherto been done. Wind, which figures in the first rank as\r\na force, has thus far, with all the mills known to us, rendered\r\nservices that are much inferior to those that we have a right to\r\nexpect from it with improved apparatus; for the work produced,\r\nwhatever the velocity of the wind, has never been greater than that\r\nthat could be effected by wind of seven meters per second. But, thanks\r\nto the experiments of recent years, we are now obtaining an effective\r\nperformance double that which we did with apparatus on the old system.\r\n\r\nDesirous of making known the efforts that have been made in this\r\ndirection, we lately described Mr. Dumont's atmospheric turbine. In\r\nspeaking of this apparatus we stated that aerial motors generally stop\r\nor are destroyed in high winds. Recently, Mr. Sanderson has\r\ncommunicated to us the result of some experiments that he has been\r\nmaking for years back by means of an apparatus which he styles a\r\npantanemone.\r\n\r\nThe engraving that we give of this machine shows merely a cabinet\r\nmodel of it; and it goes without saying that it is simply designed to\r\nexhibit the principle upon which its construction is based.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PANTANEMONE.]\r\n\r\nTwo plane surfaces in the form of semicircles are mounted at right\r\nangles to each other upon a horizontal shaft, and at an angle of 45°\r\nwith respect to the latter. It results from this that the apparatus\r\nwill operate (even without being set) whatever be the direction of the\r\nwind, except when it blows perpendicularly upon the axle, thus\r\npermitting (owing to the impossibility of reducing the surfaces) of\r\nthree-score days more work per year being obtained than can be with\r\nother mills. Three distinct apparatus have been successively\r\nconstructed. The first of these has been running for nine years in the\r\nvicinity of Poissy, where it lifts about 40,000 liters of water to a\r\nheight of 20 meters every 24 hours, in a wind of a velocity of from 7\r\nto 8 meters per second. The second raises about 150,000 liters of\r\nwater to the Villejuif reservoir, at a height of 10 meters, every 24\r\nhours, in a wind of from 5 to 6 meters. The third supplies the\r\nlaboratory of the Montsouris observatory.\r\n\r\nThe first is not directible, the second may be directed by hand, and\r\nthe third is directed automatically. These three machines defied the\r\nhurricane of the 26th of last January.--_La Nature._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRELVAS'S NEW LIFE-BOAT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Spanish and Portuguese papers have recently made known some\r\ninteresting experiments that have been made by Mr. Carlos Relvas with\r\na new life-boat which parts the waves with great facility and exhibits\r\nremarkable stability. This boat, which is shown in front view in one\r\nof the corners of our engraving, is T-shaped, and consists of a very\r\nthin keel connected with the side-timbers by iron rods. Cushions of\r\ncork and canvas are adapted to the upper part, and, when the boat is\r\non the sea, it has the appearance of an ordinary canoe, although, as\r\nmay be seen, it differs essentially therefrom in the submerged part.\r\nWhen the sea is heavy, says Mr. Relvas, and the high waves are\r\ntumbling over each other, they pass over my boat, and are powerless to\r\ncapsize it. My boat clears waves that others are obliged to recoil\r\nbefore. It has the advantage of being able to move forward, whatever\r\nbe the fury of the sea, and is capable, besides, of approaching rocks\r\nwithout any danger of its being broken.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RELVAS'S NEW LIFE BOAT.]\r\nA committee was appointed by the Portuguese government to examine this\r\nnew life-boat, and comparative experiments were made with it and an\r\nordinary life-boat at Porto on a very rough sea. Mr. Relvas's boat was\r\nmanned by eight rowers all provided with cork girdles, while the\r\ngovernment life-boat was manned by twelve rowers and a pilot, all\r\nlikewise wearing cork girdles. The chief of the maritime department,\r\nan engineer of the Portuguese navy and a Portuguese deputy were\r\npresent at the trial in a pilot boat. The three boats proceeded to the\r\nentrance of the bar, where the sea was roughest, and numerous\r\nspectators collected upon the shore and wharfs followed their\r\nevolutions from afar.\r\n\r\nThe experiments began at half past three o'clock in the afternoon. The\r\ntwo life-boats shot forward to seek the most furious waves, and were\r\nseen from afar to surmount the billows and then suddenly disappear. It\r\nwas a spectacle as moving as it was curious. It was observed that Mr.\r\nRelvas's boat cleft the waves, while the other floated upon their\r\nsurface like a nut-shell. After an hour's navigation the two boats\r\nreturned to their starting point.\r\n\r\nThe official committee that presided over these experiments has again\r\nfound in this new boat decided advantages, and has pointed out to its\r\ninventor a few slight modifications that will render it still more\r\nefficient.--_La Nature._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPERIMENTS WITH DOUBLE-BARRELED GUNS AND RIFLES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe series of experiments we are about to describe has recently been\r\nmade by Mr. Horatio Phillips, a practical gun maker of London. The\r\nresults will no doubt prove of interest to those concerned in the use\r\nor manufacture of firearms.\r\n\r\nThe reason that the two barrels of a shot gun or rifle will, if put\r\ntogether parallel, throw their charges in diverging lines has never\r\nyet been satisfactorily accounted for, although many plausible and\r\ningenious theories have been advanced for the purpose. The natural\r\nsupposition would be that this divergence resulted from the axes of\r\nthe barrels not being in the same vertical plane as the center line of\r\nthe stock. That this is not the true explanation of the fact, the\r\nfollowing experiment would tend to prove.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EXPERIMENTS WITH DOUBLE-BARRELLED GUNS.]\r\n\r\nFig. 1 represents a single barrel fitted with sights and firmly\r\nattached to a heavy block of beech. This was placed on an ordinary\r\nrifle rest, being fastened thereto by a pin at the corner, A, the\r\nblock and barrel being free to revolve upon the pin as a center.\r\nSeveral shots were fired both with the pin in position and with it\r\nremoved, the barrel being carefully pointed at the target each time.\r\nNo practical difference in the accuracy of fire was discernible under\r\neither condition. When the pin was holding the corner of the block,\r\nthe recoil caused the barrel to move from right to left in a circular\r\npath; but when the pin was removed, so that the block was not attached\r\nto the rest in any way, the recoil took place in a line with the axis\r\nof the bore. It will be observed that the conditions which are present\r\nwhen a double barreled gun is fired in the ordinary way from the\r\nshoulder were in some respects much exaggerated in the apparatus, for\r\nthe pin was a distance of 3 in. laterally from the axis of the barrel,\r\nwhereas the center of resistance of the stock of a gun against the\r\nshoulder would ordinarily be about one-sixth of this distance from the\r\naxis of the barrel. This experiment would apparently tend to prove\r\nthat the recoil does not appreciably affect the path of the\r\nprojectile, as it would seem that the latter must clear the muzzle\r\nbefore any considerable movement of the barrel takes place.\r\n\r\nWith a view to obtain a further confirmation of the result of this\r\nexperiment, it was repeated in a different form by a number of shots\r\nbeing fired from a \"cross-eyed\" rifle,[1] in which the sights were\r\nfixed in the center of the rib. Very accurate shooting was obtained\r\nwith this arm.\r\n\r\n   [Footnote 1: A cross-eyed rifle is one made with a crooked stock\r\n   for the purpose of shooting from the right shoulder, aim being\r\n   taken with the left eye.]\r\n\r\nA second theory, often broached, in order to account for the\r\ndivergence of the charge, is that the barrel which is not being fired,\r\nby its _vis inertia_ in some way causes the shot to diverge. In order\r\nto test this, Mr. Phillips took a single rifle and secured it near the\r\nmuzzle to a heavy block of metal, when the accuracy of the shooting\r\nwas in no way impaired.\r\n\r\nSo far the experiments were of a negative character, and the next step\r\nwas made with a view to discover the actual cause of the divergence\r\nreferred to. A single barrel was now taken, to which a template was\r\nfitted, in order to record its exact length. The barrel was then\r\nsubjected to a heavy internal hydrostatic pressure. Under this\r\ntreatment it expanded circumferentially and at the same time was\r\nreduced in length. This, it was considered, gave a clew to the\r\nsolution of the problem. A pair of barrels was now taken and a\r\ntemplate fitted accurately to the side of the right-hand one. As the\r\ntemplate fitted the barrel when the latter was not subject to internal\r\npressure, upon such pressure being applied any alterations that might\r\nensue in the length or contour of the barrel could be duly noted. The\r\nright-hand barrel was then subjected to internal hydrostatic pressure.\r\nThe result is shown in an exaggerated form in Fig. 2. It will be seen\r\nthat both barrels are bent into an arched form. This would be caused\r\nby the barrel under pressure becoming extended circumferentially, and\r\nthereby reduced in length, because the metal that is required to\r\nsupply the increased circumference is taken to some extent from the\r\nlength, although the substance of metal in the walls of the barrel by\r\nits expansion contributes also to the increased diameter. A simple\r\nillustration of this effect is supplied by subjecting an India-rubber\r\ntube to internal pressure. Supposing the material to be sufficiently\r\nelastic and the pressure strong enough, the tube would ultimately\r\nassume a spherical form. It is a well known fact that heavy barrels\r\nwith light charges give less divergence than light barrels with heavy\r\ncharges.\r\n\r\nAfter the above experiments it was hoped that, if a pair of barrels\r\nwere put together parallel and soldered only for a space of 3 in. at\r\nthe breech end, and were then coupled by two encircling rings joined\r\ntogether as in Fig. 4, the left-hand ring only being soldered to the\r\nbarrel, very accurate shooting would be obtained. For, it was argued,\r\nthat by these means the barrel under fire would be able to contract\r\nwithout affecting or being affected by the other barrel; that on the\r\nright-hand, it will be seen by the illustration, was the one to slide\r\nin its ring.\r\n\r\nA pair of able 0.500 bore express rifle barrels were accordingly\r\nfitted in this way. Fig. 3 shows the arrangement with the rings in\r\nposition. Upon firing these barrels with ordinary express charges it\r\nwas found that the lines of fire from each barrel respectively crossed\r\neach other, the bullet from the right-hand barrel striking the target\r\n10 in. to the left of the bull's eye, while the left barrel placed its\r\nprojectile a similar distance in the opposite direction; or, as would\r\nbe technically said, the barrels crossed 20 in. at 100 yards, the\r\nlatter distance being the range at which the experiment was made.\r\nThese last results have been accounted for in the following manner:\r\nThe two barrels were rigidly joined for a space of 3 in., and for that\r\ndistance they would behave in a manner similar to that illustrated in\r\nFig. 2, and were they not coupled at the muzzles by the connecting\r\nrings they would shoot very wide, the charges taking diverging\r\ncourses. When the connecting rings are fitted on, the barrel not being\r\nfired will remain practically straight, and, as it is coupled to the\r\nbarrel being fired by the rings, the muzzle of the latter will be\r\nrestrained from pointing outward.\r\n\r\nThe result will be as shown in an exaggerated manner by the dotted\r\nlines on the right barrel in Fig. 3.\r\n\r\nIt would appear from these experiments that when very accurate\r\nshooting is required at long ranges with double-barreled rifles, they\r\nshould be mounted in a manner similar to that adopted in the\r\nmanufacture of the Nordenfelt machine gun, in which weapon the barrels\r\nare fitted into a plate at the extreme breech end, the muzzles\r\nprojecting through holes bored to receive them in a metal plate. No\r\nunequal expansion would then take place, and the barrels would be free\r\nto become shorter independently of each other. We give the above\r\nexperiments on the authority of their author, who, we believe, has\r\ntaken great pains to render them as exhaustive as possible, so far as\r\nthey go.--_Engineering._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBALL TURNING MACHINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe distinguishing feature in the ball turning machine shown opposite\r\nis that the tool is stationary, while the work revolves in two\r\ndirections simultaneously. In the case of an ordinary spherical\r\nobject, such as brass clack ball, the casting is made from a perfect\r\npattern having two small caps or shanks, in which the centers are also\r\nmarked to avoid centering by hand. It is fixed in the machine between\r\ntwo centers carried on a face plate or chuck, with which they revolve.\r\nOne of these centers, when the machine is in motion, receives a\r\ncontinuous rotary motion about its axis from a wormwheel, D. This is\r\ndriven by a worm, C, carried on a shaft at the back of the chuck, and\r\ndriven itself by a wormwheel, B, which gears with a screw which rides\r\nloosely upon the mandrel, and is kept from rotating by a finger on the\r\nheadstock. This center, in its rotation, carries with it the ball,\r\nwhich is thus slowly moved round an axis parallel to the face plate,\r\nat the same time that it revolves about the axis of the mandrel, the\r\nresult being that the tool cuts upon the ball a scroll, of which each\r\nconvolution is approximately a circle, and lies in a plane parallel to\r\nthe line of centers.\r\n\r\nWhen the chuck is set for one size of ball, which may be done in a few\r\nminutes, any quantity of that diameter may be turned without further\r\nadjustment. A roughing cut for a 2 in. ball may be done in one minute,\r\nand a finishing cut leaving the ball quite bright in the same time.\r\nThe two paps are cut off within one-sixteenth of an inch and then\r\nbroken off, and the ball finished in the usual way. On account of the\r\nwork being geometrically true, the finishing by the ferrule tool is\r\ndone in one quarter of the time usually required.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IMPROVED BALL TURNING MACHINE.]\r\n\r\nThe chuck may be applied to an ordinary lathe or may be combined with\r\na special machine tool, as show in our illustration. In the latter\r\ncase everything is arranged in the most handy way for rapid working,\r\nand six brass balls of 2 in. in diameter can be turned and finished in\r\nan hour. The machine is specially adapted for turning ball valves for\r\npumps, pulsometers, and the like, and in the larger sizes for turning\r\ngovernor balls and spherical nuts for armor plates, and is\r\nmanufactured by Messrs. Wilkinson and Lister, of Bradford Road Iron\r\nWorks, Keighley.--_Engineering._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOOLING APPARATUS FOR INJECTION WATER.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt often happens in towns and where manufactories are crowded\r\ntogether, that the supply of water for condensing purposes is very\r\nsmall, and consequently that it attains an inconveniently high\r\ntemperature under unfavorable conditions of weather, resulting in the\r\ndeterioration of the vacuum and a consequent increase in the\r\nconsumption of fuel. To remedy or to diminish this difficulty, Messrs.\r\nBoase and Miller, of London, have brought out the water cooler\r\nillustrated above. This consists, says _Engineering_, of a revolving\r\nbasket of wire gauze surrounding an inner stationary vessel pierced\r\nwith numerous small holes, through which the heated water discharged\r\nby the air pump finds its way into the basket, to be thrown out in the\r\nform of fine spray to a distance of 20 ft. at each side. The drops are\r\nreceived in the tank or pond, and in their rapid passage through the\r\nair are sufficiently cooled to be again injected into the condenser.\r\n\r\nThe illustration shows a cooler having a basket three feet in\r\ndiameter, revolving at 300 revolutions per minute, and discharging\r\ninto a tank 40 ft. square. It requires 3 to 4 indicated horse-power to\r\ndrive it, and will cool 300 gallons per minute. The following decrease\r\nof temperature has been observed in actual practice: Water entering at\r\n95 deg. fell 20 deg. in temperature; water entering at 100 deg. to 110\r\ndeg. fell 25 deg.; and water entering at 110 deg. to 120 deg. fell 30\r\ndeg. The machine with which these trials were made was so placed that\r\nthe top of the basket was four ft. from the surface of the water in\r\nthe pond. With a greater elevation, as shown in the engraving, better\r\nresults can be obtained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IMPROVED WATER COOLING APPARATUS.]\r\n\r\nThe advantages claimed for the cooler are that by its means the\r\ntemperature of the injection water can be reduced, the cost and size\r\nof cooling ponds can be diminished, and condensing engines can be\r\nemployed where hitherto they have not been possible. The apparatus has\r\nbeen for two years in operation at several large factories, and there\r\nis every reason to believe that its use will extend, as it supplies a\r\nreal want in a very simple and ingenious manner.

Duncan\r\nBrothers, of Dundee and 32 Queen Victoria Street, E.C., are the\r\nmanufacturers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCORRUGATED DISK PULLEYS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a pulley recently introduced by Messrs. J. and E. Hall, of\r\nDartford Eng. With the exception of the boss, which is cast, it is\r\ncomposed entirely of steel or sheet iron. In place of the usual arms a\r\ncontinuous web of corrugated sheet metal connects the boss to the rim;\r\nthis web is attached to the boss by means of Spence's metal. Inside\r\nthe rim, which is flanged inward, a double hoop iron ring is fixed for\r\nstrengthening purposes. The advantageous disposition of metal obtained\r\nby means of the corrugated web enables the pulley to be made of a\r\ngiven strength with less weight of material, and from this cause and\r\nalso on account of being accurately balanced these pulleys are well\r\nadapted for high speeds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[KANSAS CITY REVIEW.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY HISTORY OF THE TELEGRAPH.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the electric telegraph is, comparatively speaking, a recent\r\ninvention, yet methods of communication at a distance, by means of\r\nsignals, have probably existed in all ages and in all nations. There\r\nis reason to believe that among the Greeks a system of telegraphy was\r\nin use, as the burning of Troy was certainly known in Greece very soon\r\nafter it happened, and before any person had returned from Troy.\r\nPolybius names the different instruments used by the ancients for\r\ncommunicating information--\"pyrsia,\" because the signals were always\r\nmade by means of fire lights. At first they communicated information\r\nof events in an imperfect manner, but a new method was invented by\r\nCleoxenus, which was much improved by Polybius, as he himself informs\r\nus, and which may be described as follows:\r\n\r\nTake the letters of the alphabet and arrange them on a board in five\r\ncolumns, each column containing five letters; then the man who signals\r\nwould hold up with his left hand a number of torches which would\r\nrepresent the number of the column from which the letter is to be\r\ntaken, and with his right hand a number of torches that will represent\r\nthe particular letter in that column that is to be taken. It is thus\r\neasy to understand how the letters of a short sentence are\r\ncommunicated from station to station as far as required. This is the\r\npyrsia or telegraph of Polybius.\r\n\r\nIt seems that the Romans had a method of telegraphing in their walled\r\ncities, either by a hollow formed in the masonry, or by a tube fixed\r\nthereto so as to confine the sound, in order to convey information to\r\nany part they liked. This method of communicating is in the present\r\nage frequently employed in the well known speaking tubes. It does not\r\nappear that the moderns had thought of such a thing as a telegraph\r\nuntil 1661, when the Marquis of Worcester, in his \"Century of\r\nInventions,\" affirmed that he had discovered a method by which a man\r\ncould hold discourse with his correspondent as far as they could\r\nreach, by night as well as by day; he did not, however, describe this\r\ninvention.\r\n\r\nDr. Hooke delivered a discourse before the Royal Society in 1684,\r\nshowing how to communicate at great distances. In this discourse he\r\nasserts the possibility of conveying intelligence from one place to\r\nanother at a distance of 120 miles as rapidly as a man can write what\r\nhe would have sent. He takes to his aid the then recent invention of\r\nthe telescope, and explains how characters exposed at one station on\r\nthe top of one hill may be made visible to the next station on the top\r\nof the next hill. He invented twenty-four simple characters, each\r\nformed of a combination of three deal boards, each character\r\nrepresenting a letter by the use of cords; these characters were\r\npushed from behind a screen and exposed, and then withdrawn behind the\r\nscreen again. It was not, however, until the French revolution that\r\nthe telegraph was applied to practical purposes; but about the end of\r\n1703 telegraphic communication was established between Paris and the\r\nfrontiers, and shortly afterward telegraphs were introduced into\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nThe history of the invention and introduction of the electric\r\ntelegraph by Prof. Morse is one of inexhaustible interest, and every\r\nincident relating to it is worthy of preservation. The incidents\r\ndescribed below will be found of special interest. The article is from\r\nthe pen of the late Judge Neilson Poe, and was the last paper written\r\nby him. He prepared it during his recent illness, the letter embodied\r\nin it from Mr. Latrobe being of course obtained at the time of its\r\ndate. It is as follows:\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of April, 1843, when the monthly meeting of the directors\r\nof the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company was about to adjourn, the\r\nPresident, the Hon. Louis McLane, rose with a paper in his hand which\r\nhe said he had almost overlooked, and which the Secretary would read.\r\nIt proved to be an application from Prof. Morse for the privilege of\r\nlaying the wires of his electric telegraph along the line of the\r\nrailroad between Baltimore and Washington, and was accompanied by a\r\ncommunication from B.H. Latrobe, Esq., Chief Engineer, recommending\r\nthe project as worthy of encouragement.\r\n\r\nOn motion of John Spear Nicholas, seconded by the Hon. John P.\r\nKennedy, the following resolution was then considered:\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, \"That the President be authorized to afford Mr. Morse such\r\nfacilities as may be requisite to give his invention a proper trial\r\nupon the Washington road, provided in his opinion and in that of the\r\nengineer it can be done without injury to the road and without\r\nembarrassment to the operations of the company, and provided Mr. Morse\r\nwill concede to the company the use of the telegraph upon the road\r\nwithout expense, and reserving to the company the right of\r\ndiscontinuing the use if, _upon experiment_, it should prove _in any\r\nmanner injurious_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whatever,\" said Mr. McLane, \"may be our individual opinions as to the\r\nfeasibility of Mr. Morse's invention, it seems to me that it is our\r\nduty to concede to him the privilege he asks, and to lend him all the\r\naid in our power, especially as the resolution carefully protects the\r\ncompany against all present or future injury to its works, and secures\r\nus the right of requiring its removal at any time.\"\r\n\r\n[In view of the fact that no railroad can now be run safely without\r\nthe aid of the telegraph, the cautious care with which the right to\r\nremove it if it should become a nuisance was reserved, strikes one at\r\nthis day as nearly ludicrous.]\r\n\r\nA short pause ensued, and the assent of the company was about to be\r\nassumed, when one of the older directors, famed for the vigilance with\r\nwhich he watched even the most trivial measure, begged to be heard.\r\n\r\nHe admitted that the rights and interests of the work were all\r\ncarefully guarded by the terms of the resolution, and that the company\r\nwas not called upon to lay out any of its means for the promotion of\r\nthe scheme. But notwithstanding all this, he did not feel, as a\r\nconscientious man, that he could, without further examination, give\r\nhis vote for the resolution. He knew that this idea of Mr. Morse,\r\nhowever plausible it might appear to theorists and dreamers, and\r\nso-called men of science, was regarded by all practical people as\r\ndestined, like many other similar projects, to certain failure, and\r\nmust consequently result in loss and possibly ruin to Mr. Morse. For\r\none, he felt conscientiously scrupulous in giving a vote which would\r\naid or tempt a visionary enthusiast to ruin himself.\r\n\r\nFortunately, the views of this cautious, practical man did not\r\nprevail. A few words from the mover of the resolution, Mr. Nicholas,\r\nwho still lives to behold the wonders he helped to create, and from\r\nMr. Kennedy, without whose aid the appropriation would not have passed\r\nthe House of Representatives, relieved the other directors from all\r\nfear of contributing to Mr. Morse's ruin, and the resolution was\r\nadopted. Of the President and thirty directors who took part in this\r\ntransaction, only three, Samuel W. Smith, John Spear Nicholas, and the\r\nwriter, survive. Under it Morse at once entered upon that test of his\r\ninvention whose fruits are now enjoyed by the people of all the\r\ncontinents.\r\n\r\nIt was not, however, until the spring of 1844 that he had his line and\r\nits appointments in such a condition as to allow the transmission of\r\nmessages between the two cities, and it was in May of that year that\r\nthe incident occurred which has chiefly led to the writing of this\r\npaper.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. LATROBE'S RECOLLECTIONS.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MR. POE: Agreeably to my promise, this morning I put\r\non paper my recollection of the introduction of the magnetic telegraph\r\nbetween Baltimore and Washington. I was counsel of the Baltimore &\r\nOhio Railroad Co. at the time, and calling on Mr. Louis McLane, the\r\nPresident, on some professional matter, was asked in the course of\r\nconversation whether I knew anything about an electric telegraph which\r\nthe inventor, who had obtained an appropriation from Congress, wanted\r\nto lay down on the Washington branch of the road. He said he expected\r\nMr. Morse, the inventor, to call on him, when he would introduce me to\r\nhim, and would be glad if I took an opportunity to go over the subject\r\nwith him and afterward let him, Mr. McLane, know what I thought about\r\nit. While we were yet speaking, Mr. Morse made his appearance, and\r\nwhen Mr. McLane introduced me he referred to the fact that, as I had\r\nbeen educated at West Point, I might the more readily understand the\r\nscientific bearings of Mr. Morse's invention. The President's office\r\nbeing no place for prolonged conversation, it was agreed that Mr.\r\nMorse should take tea at my dwelling, when we would go over the whole\r\nsubject. We met accordingly, and it was late in the night before we\r\nparted. Mr. Morse went over the history of his invention from the\r\nbeginning with an interest and enthusiasm that had survived the\r\nwearying toil of an application to Congress, and with the aid of\r\ndiagrams drawn on the instant made me master of the matter, and wrote\r\nfor me the telegraphic alphabet which is still in use over the world.\r\nNot a small part of what Mr. Morse said on this occasion had reference\r\nto the future of his invention, its influence upon communities and\r\nindividuals, and I remember regarding as the wild speculations of an\r\nactive imagination what he prophesied in this connection, and which I\r\nhave lived to see even more than realized. Nor was his conversation\r\nconfined to his invention. A distinguished artist, an educated\r\ngentleman, an observant traveler, it was delightful to hear him talk,\r\nand at this late day I recall few more pleasant evenings than the only\r\none I passed in his company.\r\n\r\nOf course, my first visit the next morning was to Mr. McLane to make\r\nmy report. By this time I had become almost as enthusiastic as Mr.\r\nMorse himself, and repeated what had passed between us. I soon saw\r\nthat Mr. McLane was becoming as eager for the construction of the line\r\nto Washington as Mr. Morse could desire. He entered warmly into the\r\nspirit of the thing, and laughed heartily, if not incredulously, when\r\nI told him that although he had been Minister to England, Secretary of\r\nState, and Secretary of the Treasury, his name would be forgotten,\r\nwhile that of Morse would never cease to be remembered with gratitude\r\nand praise. We then considered the question as to the right of the\r\ncompany to permit the line to be laid in the bed of the road--the plan\r\nof construction at that time being to bury in a trench some eight or\r\nten inches deep a half inch leaden tube containing the wrapped wire\r\nthat was to form the electric circuit. About this there was, in my\r\nopinion, no doubt, and it was not long after that the work of\r\nconstruction commenced. I met Mr. Morse from time to time while he\r\nlived, and often recurred to the evening's discussion at my house in\r\nBaltimore.\r\n\r\nThe above is the substance of what I have more than once related to\r\nother persons. I hope you will persist in your design of putting on\r\npaper your own very interesting recollections in this connection, and\r\nif what I have contributed of mine is of service to you, I shall be\r\nmuch pleased.\r\n\r\n                                  Most truly yours,\r\n                                    JOHN H.B. LATROBE.\r\nMarch 3, 1881.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE KRAVOGL ELECTRIC MOTOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the origin of every science, of whatever nature it may be, there is\r\nalways a fruitless period, of greater or less length, characterized by\r\nthe warfare of a few superior minds against general apathy. The finest\r\ndiscoveries pass unperceived, so to speak, since they cannot cross the\r\nlimits of a narrow circle; and it often happens that they fall into\r\noblivion before they have been seriously judged. Meanwhile, a slow\r\nprogress is imperceptibly made, and, in measure as theoretical\r\nprinciples more clearly disengage themselves, a few industrial\r\napplications spring up and have the effect of awakening curiosity. An\r\nimpulse is thus given, and from this moment a movement in advance goes\r\non increasing at a headlong pace from day to day.\r\n\r\nWith electricity this period has been of comparatively short duration,\r\nsince scarcely a century and a half separate us from the first\r\nexperiments made in this line of research. Now that it has truly taken\r\nits place in a rank with the other sciences, we like to go back to the\r\nhesitations of the first hour, and trace, step by step, the history of\r\nthe progress made, so as to assign to each one that portion of the\r\nmerit that belongs to him in the common work. When we thus cast a\r\nretrospective glance we find ourselves in the presence of one strange\r\nfact, and that is the simultaneousness of discoveries. That an\r\nabsolutely original idea, fertile in practical consequences, should\r\nrise at a given moment in a fine brain is well; we admire the\r\ndiscovery, and, in spite of us, a little surprise mingles with our\r\nadmiration. But is it not a truly curious thing that _several_\r\nindividuals should have had at nearly the same time that idea that was\r\nso astonishing in one? This, however, is a fact that the history of\r\nelectrical inventions offers more than one example of. No one ignores\r\nthe fact that the invention of the telephone gave rise to a notorious\r\nlawsuit, two inventors having had this ingenious apparatus patented on\r\nthe same day and at nearly the same hour. This is one example among a\r\nthousand. In the history of dynamo-electric machines it is an equally\r\ndelicate matter to fix upon the one to whom belongs the honor of\r\nhaving first clearly conceived the possibility of engendering\r\ncontinuous currents.\r\n\r\nWe do not wish to take up this debate nor to go over the history of\r\nthe question again. Every one knows that the first continuous current\r\nelectric generator whose form was practical is due to Zenobius Gramme,\r\nand dates back to July, 1871, an epoch at which appeared a memoir\r\n(entitled \"Note upon a magneto-electric machine that produces\r\ncontinuous currents\") that was read to the Academy of Sciences by Mr.\r\nJamin. Ten years previous, Pacinotti had had a glimpse of the\r\nphenomenon, and of its practical realization, but was unfortunately\r\nunable to appreciate the importance of his discovery and the benefit\r\nthat might be reaped from it. It is of slight consequence whether\r\nGramme knew of this experiment or not, for the glory that attaches to\r\nhis name could not be diminished for all that. But an interesting fact\r\nthat we propose to dwell upon now has recently been brought to light\r\nin an electrical review published at Vienna.[1] It results from\r\ndocuments whose authenticity cannot be doubted that, as far back as\r\n1867, Mr. L. Pfaundler, a professor at Innsbruck, very clearly\r\nannounced the reversibility of a magneto-electric motor constructed by\r\nKravogl, a mechanician of the same place, and that he succeeded some\r\ntime before Gramme in obtaining continuous currents.\r\n\r\n   [Footnote 1: _Zeitschrift des Electrotechnischen Vereines_ in\r\n   _Wien_, July, 1883.]\r\n\r\nThe Kravogl motor that figured at the Universal Exhibition of 1867 is\r\nbut little known, and it is now very difficult to obtain drawings of\r\nit. What is certain is that this motor is an application of the\r\nproperties of the solenoid, and, from this standpoint, resembles the\r\nBessolo motor that was patented in 1855. We may figure the apparatus\r\nto our mind very well if we suppose that in the Gramme ring a half and\r\nalmost two-thirds of the core are removed, and the spirals are movable\r\naround the said core. If a current be sent into a portion of the\r\nspirals only, and in such a way that only half of the core be exposed,\r\nthe latter will move with respect to the bobbin or the bobbin with\r\nrespect to the core, according as we suppose the solenoid or the\r\nbobbin fixed. In the first case we have a Bessolo motor, and in the\r\nsecond a Kravogl one.\r\n\r\nIn order to obtain a continuous motion it is only necessary to allow\r\nthe current to circulate successively in the different portions of the\r\nsolenoid. It is difficult to keep the core in place, since it is\r\nunreachable, being placed in the interior of the bobbin. Kravogl\r\nsolved this difficulty by constructing a hollow core into which he\r\npoured melted lead. This heavy piece, mounted upon rollers, assumed a\r\nposition of equilibrium that resulted from its weight, from friction,\r\nand from magnetic attraction. But for a current of given intensity\r\nthis position, once reached, did not vary, and so necessitated a\r\nsimple adjustment of the rubbers. Under such circumstances, with a\r\nsomewhat large number of sections, the polarity of the core was nearly\r\nconstant. The spirals as a whole were attached to a soft iron armature\r\nthat had the effect of closing up the lines of forces and forming a\r\nshell, so to speak.\r\n\r\nLike Bessolo, Kravogl never thought of making anything but a motor,\r\nand did not perceive that his machine was reversible. It results from\r\nsome correspondence between Dr. A. Von Waltenhofen and Mr. L.\r\nPfaundler at this epoch that the latter clearly saw the possibility of\r\nutilizing this motor as a current generator. Under date of November 9,\r\n1867, he wrote, in speaking of the Kravogl motor, which had just been\r\ntaken to Innsbruck in order to send it to Paris. \"I regret that I\r\nshall not be able to see it any more, for I should have liked to try\r\nto make it act in an opposite direction, that is to say, to produce a\r\ncurrent or an electric light by means of mechanical work.\" A little\r\nmore than two years later these experiments were carried out on a\r\nlarger motor constructed by Kravogl in 1869, and Mr. Pfaundler was\r\nenabled to write as follows: \"Upon running the machine by hand we\r\nobtain a current whose energy is that of one Bunsen element.\" This\r\nletter is dated February 11, 1870, that is to say, it is a year\r\nanterior to the note of Gramme.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.]\r\n\r\nIn the presence of the historic interest that attaches to the\r\nquestion, we do not think it will be out of place to reproduce here\r\nthe considerations that guided Prof. Pfaundler in the researches that\r\nled him to convert the Kravogl motor into a dynamo-electric machine.\r\nLet us consider two magnetized bars, _db_ and _bd'_, placed end to end\r\nand surrounded by a cylindrical armature forming a shell, this\r\narmature being likewise supposed to be a permanent magnet and to\r\npresent poles of contrary direction opposite the poles of the bars.\r\nFor the sake of greater simplicity this shell is represented by a part\r\nonly in the figure, _s n n s_. If, into a magnetic field thus\r\nformed, we pass a spiral from left to right, the spiral will be\r\ntraversed by a current whose direction will change according to the\r\nway in which the moving is done. It is only necessary to apply Lenz's\r\nlaw to see that a reversal of the currents will occur at the points,\r\n_a_ and _c_, the direction of the current being represented by arrows\r\nin the figure. If we suppose a continual displacement of the spirals\r\nfrom left to right, we shall collect a continuous current by placing\r\ntwo rubbers at _a_ and _c_. Either the core or the shell may be\r\nreplaced by a piece of soft iron. In such a case this piece will move\r\nwith the spiral and keep its poles that are developed by induction\r\nfixed in space. From this, in order to reach a dynamo-electric machine\r\nit is necessary to try to develop the energy of the magnetic field by\r\nthe action of the current itself. If we suppose the core to be of soft\r\niron, and make a closer study of the action of the current as regards\r\nthe polarity that occurs under the influence of the poles, _s_, _n_,\r\n_s_, we shall see that from _d_ to _a_ and from _b_ to _c_ the current\r\nis contrary, while that from _a_ to _b_ and from _c_ to _d'_ it is\r\nfavorable to the development of such polarity. In short, with a spiral\r\nmoving from _d_ to _d'_ the resulting effect is _nil_, a fact,\r\nmoreover, that is self-evident. Under such circumstances, if we\r\nsuppose the shell, as well as the core, to be of soft iron, we shall\r\nobtain a feeble current due to the presence of remanent magnetism; but\r\nthis magnetism will not be able to continue increasing under the\r\ninfluence of the current. To solve this difficulty two means present\r\nthemselves: (1) to cause a, favorable magnetic current and act upon\r\nthe armature, and (2) to suppress such portions of the current in the\r\nspirals as are injurious in effect. The first solution was thought of\r\nby Gramme in 1871, and is represented diagramatically in Fig. 2. The\r\nsecond is due to Prof. Pfaundler, and dates back to 1870. The core is\r\ncut through the center (Fig. 3), and the portion to the right is\r\nsuppressed; the current is interrupted between _da_ and _cd'_, and is\r\nclosed only between _a_ and _c_ (_v_, Fig. 1). It results from this\r\narrangement that, under the action of the current, the polarity due to\r\nremanent magnetism does nothing but increase. It suffices then for but\r\nlittle remanent magnetism to prime the machine; the polarity of the\r\nshell continues to increase, and the energy of the magnetic field, and\r\nconsequently of the current, has for a limit only the saturation of\r\nthe soft iron. If, now, we curve the core, the spirals, and the\r\narmature into a circle, we have a Gramme or a Pfaundler machine,\r\naccording as we consider Fig. 2 or Fig. 3.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.]\r\n\r\nThis latter apparatus has in this case the form shown in Fig. 4.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.]\r\n\r\nThe spiral, _s m b_, is movable, and the core, N _o s_, is kept in a\r\nposition of equilibrium by virtue of its weight, and is provided with\r\nrollers. For the sake of greater clearness, the front part of the\r\narmature is supposed to be removed. The current does not circulate in\r\nthe spirals to the right of the diameter, W O, which latter is not\r\nabsolutely vertical. The position of the rubbers and armature is\r\nregulated once for all. We do not know just what were the means\r\ndevised by Kravogl to suppress the current in the spheres to the\r\nright. At all events, it is probable that the system has grown old\r\nsince Gramme invented his collector. In the application of the Kravogl\r\nmotor to the generation of continuous currents, Professor Pfaundler\r\nnow proposes to ingeniously utilize the Gramme collector. In such a\r\ncase the arrangement shown in Fig. 5 would be adopted. Let us suppose\r\nan ordinary collector having as many plates as there are sections in\r\nthe ring, these plates being connected as usual with the entrance and\r\nexit wires of the sections. The diametrically opposite touches that\r\nare in the line, W O, are divided, and one of the halves is connected\r\nat the entrance, _c a'_ (Fig. 4), with the corresponding section,\r\nwhile the other communicates with the exit, _c' a_, of the neighboring\r\nsection. Each of these halves is prolonged by a piece of metal bent\r\ninto the form of an arc of a circle and embracing a little less than a\r\nsemi-circumference. Between these prolongations there is an insulating\r\npart. In the rotary motion of the spiral, at least one of the touches\r\nis always outside of the arc comprised between the brushes, R. In\r\norder to secure a continuity of the circuit in the effective arc, W S_ o_,\r\nit is only necessary to arrange a rubber, M, in such a way as to\r\nestablish a communication between the two parts of the divided touch\r\nas soon as this latter enters the arc under consideration.\r\n\r\nIn order to produce a current in the direction of the arrows shown in\r\nFig. 4, the spiral and axle must revolve from right to left. In this\r\ncase the rubber, M, occupies the position shown in the same figure,\r\nthe brushes embracing an arc of a little less than 180°. As soon as\r\nthe lower touch comes in contact with the brush, R, when the\r\nrevolution is being effected from left to right, the rubber, M,\r\nestablishes a communication between the two halves that have until now\r\nbeen isolated, and the current is no longer interrupted. The second\r\ntouch during this time is at any point whatever of the arc, W N _o_,\r\nand the spirals corresponding to the latter arc outside of the\r\ncircuit. In short, thanks to the rubber, M, we have an ordinary Gramme\r\ncollector in that portion of the circuit comprised between the\r\nbrushes, and a collector with a breakage of the circuit in the portion\r\nto the right.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.]\r\n\r\nThis type of machine is entirely theoretical. In the apparatus used\r\nfor Prof. Pfaundler's experiments in 1870, the armature revolved with\r\nthe solenoid. The core and armature were of soft iron, and the core\r\nwas arranged in a manner analogous to the preceding, and remained in\r\nplace under the action of its weight, and the shell, forming a\r\ncomplete circle, revolved with poles fixed in space.\r\n\r\nPractically, the machine that we have just described would prove\r\ninconvenient to realize, and would present serious inconveniences. In\r\nthe first place, it seems to us quite difficult to transmit the motion\r\nof the solenoid to the axle, supposing the former to revolve within\r\nthe armature. In the second place, considerable friction would surely\r\noccur between the spirals and core, and the axle, being submitted to a\r\nlateral stress, would be placed in a poor condition for work. It is\r\neven allowable to doubt whether such a type could be practically got\r\nup. At all events, no trial has as yet been made of it.\r\n\r\nCompared with the Gramme machine, from an absolutely theoretical point\r\nof view, the Pfaundler apparatus presents undoubted advantages. A\r\ntheoretically perfect dynamo electric machine would be one in which\r\nthere was a complete reciprocity between the magnetizing action of the\r\ncurrent and the inductive action of the magnetic field. Now, such is\r\nnot the case in the Gramme machine. In this apparatus the soft iron\r\ncore is at the same time a magnet through favorable induction and a\r\ndisadvantageous electro-magnet. This double polarization is only\r\nremedied to a certain extent by the adjustment of the brushes. In the\r\nPfaundler machine, on the contrary, the electro-magnetism and\r\nmagnetism through induction act in the same direction, and concur in\r\neffecting a polarization that favors the production of the current.\r\nLooked at it in this light, the latter machine more nearly approaches\r\nthe type of perfection than does that of Gramme.\r\n\r\nBut we must not forget that such qualities are purely theoretical. In\r\npractice the best machine is that in which the copper is best\r\nutilized, that is to say, that which with a given weight of this metal\r\nfurnishes the most work. Now, this is certainly not the case in the\r\nPfaundler machine, for here half or more than half of the ring is\r\ninert--a defect which is apparent at first sight. It results from this\r\nthat as soon as we propose to obtain an electromotive force, however\r\nslight it be, we must get it with machines of large dimensions. Now,\r\nit is permissible to believe that under such circumstances (taking\r\ninto consideration the complication of mechanical means that the\r\nconstruction of such apparatus necessitates, and the great friction\r\nthat occurs) it would be impossible to obtain practical rotary\r\nvelocities. Comparing his machine with Gramme's, Prof. Pfaundler\r\nexpresses the idea that between them there is the same analogy as\r\nthere is between a constant pressure and an expansion engine. With\r\ncylinders of equal diameters the work performed by the former of these\r\nis greater than that done by the second, but in the latter the\r\nexpansive force of the steam is better utilized. This comparison seems\r\nto us to be more ingenious than exact. Would it not be coming nearer\r\nto the truth if we were to suppose a case of a hydraulic motor whose\r\nperformance continued diminishing with the height of the fall, and\r\nwould it not be advantageous under such circumstances to utilize only\r\na portion of the fall for the purpose of increasing the motor's\r\nperformance?\r\n\r\nThis machine, however, as before stated, has never as yet been\r\nconstructed, so that experimental data relative to its mode of working\r\nare wanting. It is especially interesting as regards its origin, which\r\ndates back to an epoch at which researches on the dynamo electric\r\nmachine were at their heat. It is in its historical aspect that it is\r\nproper to regard it, and it is from such a point of view that we have\r\ndeemed it well to say a few words about it in this place.--_La Lumiere\r\nElectrique._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBORNHARDT'S ELECTRIC MACHINE FOR BLASTING IN MINES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe shall not attempt to pass in review the several apparatus that have\r\nhitherto been devised for igniting blasts in mining operations, but\r\nshall simply describe in this place a machine recently invented for\r\nthis purpose by Mr. Bornhardt, an engineer to the Grand Duke of\r\nBrunswick.\r\n\r\nThis apparatus (shown in the accompanying engravings) consists\r\nessentially of two hard-rubber disks, A (Figs. 2 and 3), keyed to an\r\niron axle, and of two rubbers, B, that are formed of skin and are held\r\nagainst the disks by small springs, R; motion is communicated to the\r\naxle, _a_, by means of a pair of gearings, _a_ and _b_, and a crank,\r\n_f_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BORNHARDT'S ELECTRIC MACHINE FOR BLASTING IN MINES.]\r\n\r\nEach disk revolves between two metallic rings, _c_, provided with\r\npoints that attract and collect in Leyden jars, D, the electricity\r\nproduced by the friction. For discharging the condensers there is\r\nemployed a manipulator formed of a rod, mm, which can be acted upon,\r\nfrom the exterior, by means of a button, _k_. Upon bringing the ball,\r\n_m_, of the rod in contact with the ball, _p_, of the condenser, the\r\nlever (which then takes the position shown by the dotted line)\r\ncontinues to remain in connection with a small ring, _q_, through a\r\nspecial spring. Another ring, _t_, is connected in the same way with\r\nthe external armature of the condenser. Upon connecting the rings, _p_\r\nand _t_, by a wire to which cartridges are attached, any number of the\r\nlatter may be ignited.\r\n\r\nThe parts that we have just enumerated are inclosed in a tin box\r\ncovered with a wooden casing, P. Between the two there is inserted a\r\nsheet of hard rubber in order to prevent a loss of electricity; the\r\nwhole is held in place by strong springs.\r\n\r\nIn order to show the normal state of the condenser, a scale consisting\r\nof 15 metallic buttons to give the dimensions of the sparks, is\r\narranged at X. This scale is capable of being connected with the\r\nrings, _q_ and _t_, by means of chains; when the spark obtained after 15\r\nor 20 revolutions considerably exceeds the intervals of the scale, it\r\nis a sure thing that the machine is in a proper state.\r\n\r\nIn order to prepare the apparatus for carriage, the winch is taken off\r\nand placed in the compartment, _m_, which is closed by means of a\r\ndoor, Q.\r\n\r\nFigs. 5 and 6 show the arrangement of the dynamite cartridges and\r\nwires in the blast hole. Figs. 7 to 10 show different arrangements of\r\nthe igniting wires. Figs. 11 and 12 give the general arrangement for\r\nigniting a number of cartridges simultaneously by means of the\r\nelectric machine. Fig. 13 shows the arrangement where powder is\r\nemployed. Fig. 14 shows the arrangement of a horizontal\r\nhole.--_Annales Industrielles._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVED ELECTRIC FIRE ALARM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe object of this apparatus is to close an electric circuit when the\r\ntemperature of a room rises above a certain point. Many devices have\r\nbeen invented for effecting this object, each of which have their own\r\nadvantages or disadvantages. The invention of Mr. Pritchett enables\r\nthe required result to be obtained in a very satisfactory manner. The\r\napparatus consists (as shown by the figure) of a long glass vessel\r\ncontaining air; connected to this vessel there is a glass tube filled\r\nwith mercury. The whole is mounted on a metal cradle, which turns on\r\npivots. According to the position which the glass vessel and its\r\nadjuncts occupy in the cradle (this position being adjustable by means\r\nof a thumb-screw, seen at the upper part of the cradle), so will the\r\nsame have a tendency to rock longitudinally over to one side or the\r\nother. Now, if we suppose the position to be such that the right hand\r\nend of the glass vessel is depressed, and the left hand end raised,\r\nthen if the vessel becomes subjected to an elevation of temperature,\r\nthe air inside the same will become expanded, and the mercury column\r\nin the tube will be driven over to the left, and will rise in the\r\nturned up end of the tube. This will cause the left hand branch of the\r\nglass vessel, and its attachments, to become increased in weight,\r\nwhile the right hand branch will become proportionally lighter; the\r\nconsequence of this will be that the vessel and its cradle will cant\r\nover, and by falling on an electrical contact will close a circuit and\r\nsound an alarm. It is obvious that the apparatus is equally well\r\nadapted for indicating a diminution as well as an increase of\r\ntemperature, for if the electrical contact be placed under the right\r\nhand portion of the cradle, and the latter be adjusted so that in its\r\nnormal position its left hand portion is depressed, then when the\r\nglass vessel becomes cooled, the air in it will contract, and the\r\nmercury will fall in the turned-up portion of the tube before referred\r\nto, and will rise in the limb connected to the vessel, consequently\r\nthe cradle and glass vessel will cant over in the reverse way to that\r\nwhich it did in the first case.\r\n\r\nOwing to the surface which the glass vessel exposes, the air inside\r\nquickly responds to any external change of temperature, consequently\r\nthe apparatus is very sensitive. Another important feature is the fact\r\nthat the cradle and vessel in canting over acquires a certain\r\nmomentum, and thus the contact made becomes very certain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PRITCHETT'S ELECTRIC FIRE ALARM.]\r\n\r\nMr. Pritchett proposes that his apparatus shall give external evidence\r\noutside the house by ringing a gong, and by dropping a semaphore arm\r\nreleased by an electromagnet. He also proposes (as has often been\r\nsuggested) that a water supply shall be automatically turned\r\non.--_Electrical Review._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA STANDARD THERMOPILE.\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. G. Gore, F.R.S., has invented an improved thermopile for\r\nmeasuring small electromotive forces. It consists of about 300 pairs\r\nof horizontal, slender, parallel wires of iron and German silver, the\r\nformer being covered with cotton. They are mounted on a wooden frame.\r\nAbout 1½ in. of the opposite ends of the wires are bent downward to a\r\nvertical position to enable them to dip into liquids at different\r\ntemperatures contained in long narrow troughs; the liquids being\r\nnon-conductors, such as melted paraffin for the hot junctions, and the\r\nnon-volatile petroleum, known as thin machinery oil. The electromotive\r\nforce obtained varies with the temperature; a pile of 295 pairs having\r\na resistance of 95.6 ohms at 16 deg. Cent. gave with a difference of\r\ntemperature of 100 deg. Cent. an electromotive force of 0.7729 volts,\r\nor with 130 deg. Cent. an electromotive force of 1.005 volt. Each\r\nelement, therefore, equaled 0.0000262 volt for each degree Cent.\r\ndifference of temperature. On having been verified with a standard\r\nvoltaic cell the apparatus becomes itself a standard, especially for\r\nsmall electromotive forces. It is capable of measuring the 1/34861\r\npart of a volt. For higher electromotive forces than a volt, several\r\nof these piles would have to be connected in series. The fractional\r\nelectromotive force is obtained by means of a sliding contact which\r\ncuts out so many pairs as is required.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEPHONIC TRANSMISSION WITHOUT RECEIVERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe annual meeting of the French Society of Physics, the success of\r\nwhich is continually increasing, took place this year in the salons of\r\nthe Observatory, which were kindly placed at the Society's disposal by\r\nAdmiral Mouchez.\r\n\r\nThere were three consecutive sessions, the one of Tuesday, April 15,\r\nbeing set apart for the members of the Association, the one of the\r\n16th for the invited guests of Admiral Mouchez, and that of the 17th\r\nfor the invited guests of the Society. The salons were partially\r\nlighted by the Siemens differential arc, continuous current lamps, and\r\npartially by the Swan incandescent lamp supplied by a distributing\r\nmachine that permitted of the lamps being lighted and extinguished at\r\nwill without changing the normal operation of all the rest. Many\r\napparatus figured at this exhibition, but we shall on the present\r\noccasion merely call attention to those that presented a certain\r\ncharacter of novelty or of originality.\r\n\r\nAmong the apparatus that we shall reserve a description of for the\r\npresent was Messrs. Richard Bros.' registering thermometer designed\r\nfor the Concarneau laboratory, an instrument which, when sunk at one\r\nmile from the coast, and to a depth of 40 meters, will give a diagram\r\nof the temperature of the ocean at that depth; and Mr. Hospitalier's\r\ncontinuous electrical indicators, designed for making known from a\r\ndistance such mechanical or physical phenomena as velocities, levels,\r\ntemperatures, pressures, etc.\r\n\r\nAmong the most important of the apparatus exhibited we must reckon Mr.\r\nCailletet's devices for liquefying gases, and those of Mr. Mascart for\r\ndetermining the ohm. The results obtained by Mr. Mascart (which have\r\nbeen submitted to the Committee on Unities of the Congress of\r\nElectricians now in session at Paris), are sensibly concordant with\r\nthose obtained independently in England by Lord Rayleigh. Everything\r\nleads to the hope, then, that a rapid and definite solution will be\r\ngiven of this important question of electric unities, and that nothing\r\nfurther will prevent the international development of the C.G.S.\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nMr. Jules Duboscq made a number of very successful projections, and we\r\nparticularly remarked the peculiar experiment made in conjunction with\r\nMr. Parinaud, that gave in projection two like spectra produced by the\r\nsame prism, and which, through superposition, were capable of\r\nincreasing the intensity of the colors, or, on the contrary, of\r\nreconstituting white light.\r\n\r\nAmong the optical applications we may cite Mr. Leon Laurent's\r\napparatus for controlling plane, parallel, perpendicular, and oblique\r\nsurfaces, and magic mirrors obtained with an ordinary light; Mr. S.P.\r\nThompson's apparatus for demonstrating the propagation of\r\nelectro-magnetic waves in ether (according to Maxwell's theory), as\r\nwell as some new polarizing prisms; and a mode of lighting the\r\nmicroscope (presented by Mr. Yvon), that was quite analogous to the\r\none employed more than a year ago by Dr. Van Heurck, director of the\r\nBotanical Garden of Anvers.\r\n\r\nAcoustics were represented by an electro-magnetic brake siren of Mr.\r\nBourbouze; Konig's apparatus for the synthesis of sounds; and Mr. S.P.\r\nThompson's cymatograph--a pendulum apparatus for demonstrating the\r\nphenomena of beats.\r\n\r\nIt was electricity again that occupied the largest space in the\r\nprogramme of the session.\r\n\r\nApparatus for teaching are assuming greater and greater importance\r\nevery day, and the exhibit of Mr. Ducretet included a large number of\r\nthe most interesting of these. The house of Breguet exhibited on a\r\nreduced scale the magnificent experiments of Gaston Plante, wherein\r\n320 leaden wire secondary elements charged for quantity with 3 Daniell\r\nelements, and afterward coupled for tension, served to charge a\r\nrheostatic machine formed of 50 condensers coupled for quantity. These\r\nlatter, coupled anew for tension, furnished upon being discharged a\r\nspark due to a difference of potential of about 32,000 volts that\r\npresented all the characters of the spark produced by induction coils\r\non the machines so improperly called \"static.\" Finally, we may cite\r\nthe apparatus arranged by Mr. S.P. Thompson for studying the\r\ndevelopment of currents in magneto-electric machines. The inventor\r\nstudies the influence of the forms of the inductors and armatures of\r\nmachines by means of an arrangement that allows him to change the\r\nrings or armatures at will and to take out the induced bobbins in\r\norder to sound every part of the magnetic field. Upon giving the\r\narmature an angular motion limited by two stops, there develops a\r\ncertain quantity of electricity that may be measured by causing it to\r\ntraverse an appropriate ballistic galvanometer. Messrs. Deprez and\r\nD'Arsonval's galvanometer answers very well for this purpose, and its\r\naperiodicity, which causes it quickly to return to zero as soon as the\r\ninduced current ceases, permits of a large number of readings being\r\ntaken within a very short space of time.\r\n\r\nMeasuring apparatus were represented by a new and very elegant\r\narrangement of Sir William Thomson's reflecting galvanometers, due to\r\nMr. J. Carpentier. The mounting adopted by Mr. Carpentier permits of\r\nan easy removal of the bobbins and of an instantaneous substitution\r\ntherefor. The galvanometric part, composed of the needles and mirror,\r\ntherefore remains entirely free, thus allowing of its being verified,\r\nand making it convenient to attach the silken fiber. Mr. Carpentier\r\nhas, moreover, adopted for all the minor apparatus a transparent\r\ncelluloid scale which simplifies them, facilitates observations, and\r\nrenders the use of reflection almost industrial.\r\n\r\nWe shall complete our enumeration of the measuring apparatus by citing\r\nDucretet's non-oscillating galvanometer, Sir William Thomson's\r\namperemeters, voltameters, ohmmeters, and mhosmeters, constructed and\r\nexhibited by Breguet, and a new aperiodic galvanoscope of Mr. Maiche.\r\nMr. Baudot exhibited the recent improvements that he has made in his\r\nmultiplex printing telegraph, and M. Boudet of Paris showed a new\r\nsystem of telephone transmission by submarine cables.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--DIAGRAM EXHIBITING THE ARRANGEMENT FOR\r\nTELEPHONIC TRANSMISSIONS WITHOUT A RECEIVER.]\r\n\r\nFinally, we shall conclude our enumeration by referring to the\r\ncuriosities. The house of Siemens exhibited a miniature electric\r\nrailway actuated by a new model of Reynier accumulators; M. Maiche\r\noperated a system of musical telephonic auditions that differed only\r\nin detail from those instituted by Mr. Ader at the exhibition of 1881;\r\nand Mr. Hospitalier presented a new form of an experiment devised by\r\nMr. Giltay, consisting of a telephonic transmission of sounds without\r\nthe use of receivers. Mr. Giltay's experiment is nothing but Mr.\r\nDunand's speaking condenser without the condenser. A glance at Fig. 1\r\nwill show how things are arranged for the experiment. The transmitting\r\nsystem comprises two distinct circuits, viz.: (1) one formed of a\r\npile, P, of 2 or 3 Leclanche elements, or of 1 or 2 small sized\r\naccumulators, an Ader microphane transmitter, M, and the inducting\r\nwire of a small induction coil, B; and (2) the other formed of the\r\ninduced wire of the coil, B, of a pile, P', of 10 or 12 Leclanche\r\nelements, and of a line whose extremities terminate at R, in two\r\nordinary electro-medical handles. With this arrangement the experiment\r\nperformed is as follows: When any one speaks or sings in front of the\r\ntransmitter, T, while two persons, A and B, each having one hand\r\ngloved, are holding the handles in the ungloved hand, it is only\r\nnecessary for A to place his gloved hand upon B's ear, or for the\r\nlatter to place his hand upon A's, or for each to place his hand on\r\nthe other's ear simultaneously, in order that A or B, or A and B\r\nsimultaneously, may hear a voice issuing from the glove. Under these\r\ncircumstances, Mr. Giltay's experiment is explained like Dunand's\r\nspeaking condenser--the hand of A and the ear of B here constituting\r\nthe armature of an elementary condenser in which the glove performs\r\nthe role of dielectric.\r\n\r\nUpon repeating this experiment at the laboratory of the School of\r\nPhysics and Industrial Chemistry of Paris, it has been found that the\r\nglove maybe replaced by a sheet of plain or paraffined paper. In this\r\ncase, when two persons are holding the handles, and have their ears\r\napplied, one against the other, if a sheet of paper be interposed,\r\nairs or words will be heard to proceed therefrom. Finally, it has been\r\nfound possible to entirely suppress the paper, or dielectric, and to\r\nhear directly, by simply interposing the auditor or auditors in the\r\ncircuit. One of the most curious forms of the experiment is the one\r\nshown in Fig. 2. Here a third person, C, hears the hands of A and B\r\nspeak when a circuit is formed by means of three persons, A, B, and C,\r\nthe two former, A and B, each holding one of the wires of the circuit\r\nand applying his free hand to the ear of C. Although the experiment is\r\none that requires entire silence, and could not on that account be\r\nperformed at the laboratory, a sort of telephonic chain can be formed\r\nin which five or six persons may hear at the same time. A, putting his\r\nhand on the ear of B, the latter putting his to that of C, and so on\r\nup to the last person, who closes the circuit by grasping one of the\r\nhandles, the other one being held by A.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EXPERIMENT ON TELEPHONIC TRANSMISSION WITHOUT\r\nRECEIVING APPARATUS.]\r\n\r\nIt is difficult in the present state of science to explain very\r\nclearly how these telephonic transmissions are effected without a\r\nreceiver. All that we can conclude from it so far is that the ear is\r\nan instrument of incomparable delicacy and of exquisite sensitiveness,\r\nsince it perceives vibrations in which the energy developer,\r\nparticularly in the telephonic chain, is exceedingly feeble.\r\n\r\nWithout any desire to seek an application for an experiment that is\r\nsimply curious, we yet believe that there is here a phenomenon of a\r\nnature to be studied by physicists. Discoveries in telephony and\r\nmicrophony have certainly opened up to science, as regards both theory\r\nand practice, new horizons that still promise other surprises for the\r\nfuture. But to return to the observatory: The success obtained by the\r\nexhibition of the French Society of Physics shows that these reunions\r\nrespond to a genuine need--that of instructing in and popularizing\r\nscience. While warmly congratulating the organizers of these meetings,\r\nwe may express a wish that the good example set by the Society of\r\nPhysics may be followed by other societies. We are convinced in\r\nadvance that an equal success awaits them.--_La Nature._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE ARRANGEMENT OF GROUND CONDUCTORS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn telegraphy, as well as in the question of lightning rods, attention\r\nhas been but incidentally paid to the improvement of ground\r\nconductors, and this point has not been the object of that careful\r\nstudy that has been bestowed upon the establishment of aerial lines.\r\nIt is only recently that the interest created by lightning rods has\r\ngiven rise to new forms of conductors differing from those formerly\r\nused. The publications of the Prussian Academy of Sciences of from\r\n1876 to 1880 contain some information of special importance in regard\r\nto this. It is stated therein that the effect of ground conductors may\r\nbe notably increased by the division of the earth plates and the use\r\nof metallic rods, without necessitating a greater output of material.\r\nThese facts, however, have not as yet been put to profit in practice\r\nfor the reason, perhaps, that the considerations, which have remained\r\ngeneral, have not at once permitted of obtaining forms what could be\r\nemployed with perfect knowledge of the results. This is what led Mr.\r\nUlbricht, of Dresden, to make calculations for a few forms of\r\nconductors, and to test their approximate values. The results of these\r\nresearches are printed in the _Elektrotechnischen Zeitschrift_ for\r\n1883 (p. 18).\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe equations found show, in the first place, that there exist three\r\nmeans of obtaining a considerable effect, as regards the ground\r\nconductor, with a slight expenditure of material: The cylindrical\r\nelectrode may be drawn out into the form of a bar or wire; the plate\r\nmay be rendered narrow, and elongated in the form of a ribbon; and,\r\nbesides, the annular plate may be enlarged in lessening the metallic\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nFinally, a short, open cylinder with a vertical axis may be formed by\r\ncurving a narrow plate or ribbon. It is not necessary to see the\r\nformula to recognize the fact that this cylinder must behave like a\r\nribbon and a flat ring. The radius increasing, and the surface\r\nremaining constant, the resistance of the earth here likewise\r\napproaches zero.\r\n\r\nAs the resistance of the earth is inversely proportional to the\r\ndiameter of the plates, the zero resistance can also be reached by\r\ndividing a plate _ad infinitum_. As the parts of the plate may be\r\nbrought quite close to each other without perceptibly interfering with\r\nthe action, a _network_ has finally been reached by a division carried\r\nvery far, yet limited, and by connecting the parts with one another by\r\nconducting cylinders.\r\n\r\nIf we seek to determine what forms of ground conductors are efficient\r\nand economical under given conditions, we shall have to begin by\r\ninforming ourselves as to the choice of material to be used for the\r\nelectrode, and shall then have to ascertain whether putting it in the\r\nground will or will not necessitate much outlay. The most suitable\r\nmaterial is copper, which may be used with advantage, in that it lasts\r\npretty well underground, and that the facility which it may be worked\r\npermits of easily giving it more appropriate forms than those that can\r\nbe obtained with cast iron, which is of itself less costly.\r\n\r\nIf the burying in the ground requires little or no labor, as when\r\nthere exist ponds, rivers, and wells, or subterranean strata of water\r\nnear the surface of the earth, elongated forms of conductors will be\r\nemployed, such as the solid or hollow cylinder, the wire, the ribbon,\r\nthe narrow ring, and the network. Plates approaching a square or\r\ncircular shape are not advantageous. But if the ground has to be dug\r\ndeeply in order to sink the conductor, the form of the electrode must\r\nbe more condensed, and selected in such a way that the necessary\r\naction may be obtained with a minimum output of copper and labor. For\r\ngreat depths, and when the ground will permit of boring, an elongated\r\nand narrow cylinder will be used. Such a system, however, can only be\r\nemployed when the cylinder is surrounded by spring water, since,\r\nwithout that, an intimate contact with earth that is only moist,\r\ncannot be obtained with certainty. In earth that is only moist and for\r\nmoderate depths, preference may be given to an electrode laid down\r\nflat. The digging necessary in this case is onerous, it is true, but\r\nit permits of very accurately determining the state of the earth\r\nbeneath and of obtaining a very perfect adherence of the electrode\r\ntherewith. Two forms, the annular ribbon or the flat ring and the\r\nnetwork, present themselves, according to calculations, as a\r\nsubstitute for copper plates, which are so expensive; and these forms\r\nare satisfactory on condition that the labor of digging be not notably\r\nincreased. These forms should always have a diameter a little greater\r\nthan that of the plate. The flat ring and the network, however, offer\r\none weak point, which they possess in common with the plate, and that\r\nis, their dimensions cannot be easily adapted to the nature of the\r\nground met with without a notable increase in the expense. Now, if the\r\nground should offer a conductivity less than what was anticipated, and\r\nit were desired to increase the plate, say by one-third, it would be\r\nimpossible to do so as a consequence of the closed form.\r\n\r\nOne important advantage is realized in this respect by combining the\r\nring and the network in the form of a reticulated ring having a\r\ndiameter of from 1 to 1½ meters. On cutting this ring at a given place\r\nand according to a certain radius we obtain the reticulated ribbon\r\nshown in the accompanying figure. The thickness of the wires is 2.5\r\nmm., and their weight is 0.475 kilo. per meter. L, L, and L are the\r\npoints at which the conducting cable is soldered. A reticulated ribbon\r\nof copper can be made in advance of any length whatever, and,\r\naccording to local exigencies, it may be easily curved and given the\r\nform of a flat or cylindrical ring of varying width. Even though the\r\nribbon has already been cut for a ring of given diameter, it may be\r\nstill further enlarged by drawing it out and leaving a bit of the ring\r\nopen, so as to thus obtain a nearly corresponding diminution in the\r\nresistance. Such a resistance may be still further diminished by\r\nrendering the ring higher, that is to say, by employing an annular\r\ncylindrical form.\r\n\r\nAfter assuring himself, by experiments on a small scale, that\r\ncalculation and observation gave concordant results for the flat ring,\r\nthe author made an experiment on a larger scale with the annular\r\nnetwork. For practical reasons he employed for this purpose a copper\r\nwire 2.5 mm. in diameter, which may be expected to last as long as one\r\nof iron plate 2 mm. in thickness. Calculation showed that in a ribbon\r\n160 mm. wide, meshes 40 mm. in breadth were advantageous and favorable\r\nas regards rigidity. A reticulated ribbon like this, 4 meters in\r\nlength, was made and formed into a flat ring having an external\r\ndiameter of 1.42 m. and an internal one of 1.10 m. The resistance of\r\nthis ring was found to be W = 0.3485 (1/_k_), and that of a plate one\r\nmeter square, W0 = 0.368 (1/_k_).\r\n\r\nAs the conductivity of the earth is very variable, and as we cannot\r\nhave an absolute guarantee that the ramming will be uniform, it seemed\r\nproper to make the measurements of the resistance by fixing the plate\r\nand the ring in succession to the lower surface of a small raft, in\r\nsuch a way that the contact with the water should correspond as well\r\nas possible to the suppositions made for the calculation. As a second\r\nground conductor, a system of water pipes was used, and, after this, a\r\nlightning rod conductor, etc.\r\n\r\nRepeated and varied experiments gave, for the calculation of the\r\nvalues of the resistances, equations so concordant that the following\r\nresults may be considered very approximate.\r\n\r\nThe square plate had a resistance of 35.5 Siemens units, and the\r\nreticulated ring one of 32.5. From the first figure we deduce k =\r\n1/91.12, that is to say, the specific conductivity of river-water is\r\n1:91120000. Calculation, then, gives as the resistance of the earth in\r\nSiemens units:\r\n\r\n                                    Calculated.

Other\r\nexperiments still had reference to the influence of immersion. In\r\norder to diminish polarization, only instantaneous currents from the\r\nmeasuring pile were employed. It was to be supposed that the current\r\nof water through which the bubbles of gas were removed from the\r\nelectrodes would not have permitted of a notable resistance of\r\npolarization. Later measurements, made upon a ribbon buried, like the\r\nplates, in the earth, gave likewise most favorable results.\r\n\r\nAs a result of these experiments, the State railways of Saxony have,\r\nin such cases as were practicable, introduced the annular network of\r\ncopper. There are some manufacturers, too, who seem desirous of\r\nadopting this system, although it has hardly emerged from the period\r\nof experiment. The pecuniary advantages that will result from an\r\napplication of it ought, it would seem, to dispel a large proportion\r\nof the criticisms directed against the erection of lightning rods,\r\nfrom the standpoint of expense, and contribute to extend an\r\narrangement which may be considered as a very happy one.\r\n\r\nIf we compare the square plate with the equivalent annular network,\r\nconstructed as above indicated, and which should possess, according to\r\nthe author an external diameter of 1.26 m. and of 3.45 m., we find\r\nthat:\r\n\r\n    The square plate, 1 mm. thick weighs 8.9 kilos.\r\n                 \"    2  \"    \"     \"   17.8   \"\r\n    The annular network             \"    1.64  \"\r\n\r\nThe cost of reticulated ribbon per meter amounts to about 4.4 francs,\r\nsupposing it to be arranged as shown in the cut.\r\n\r\nAs term of comparison, we may admit that the following forms are\r\nnearly the equivalent of a horizontal, unburied plate one meter\r\nsquare.\r\n\r\n                                   Length.

Between the two ground plates of a\r\ntelegraph line there is generally a distance such that the curves of\r\nthe current undergo no deviation in the vicinity of one of the\r\nelectrodes (the only part important for integrations) through the\r\ninfluence of the other. But it might be admitted that such would prove\r\nthe case with a lightning rod in a storm, at the time of the passage\r\nof the fluid into the earth. The ground plate here is one of the\r\nelectrodes, and the other is replaced by the surface of the earth\r\nstrongly charged to a great distance under the storm clouds. If we\r\nsuppose (what may be admitted in a good lightning rod) that there no\r\nlonger occurs any spark from the point downward, the curves of the\r\ncurrent, in starting perpendicularly from the ground plate, would be\r\nobliged to leave their rectilinear trajectory and strike the surface\r\nof the earth at right angles. When the electricity flows through a\r\nplane surface into an infinite body, it is only when such surface\r\npresents a very great development that the respective potentials\r\ndecrease very slowly in the vicinity of the said surface. No notable\r\nmodification occurs, then, in the curves of equal potential, in the\r\nvicinity of the ground plate through the action of this extended\r\ncharge, nor consequently any modification in the curves of the\r\ncurrent; but the electricity which spreads has but a short distance to\r\ntravel in order to overcome the most important resistances.\r\n\r\nThe calculations of resistances given above have, then, the same value\r\nfor discharges of atmospheric electricity.--_Bull. du Musee de\r\nl'Industrie._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON ELECTROLYSIS.\r\n\r\nBy H. SCHUCHT.\r\n\r\n\r\nConcerning the separations which take place at the positive pole, the\r\ncomposition of the peroxides, and the manner of their determination,\r\nrelatively little has been done.\r\n\r\nIf solutions of the salts of lead, thallium, silver, bismuth, nickel,\r\nand cobalt are decomposed by the current between platinum electrodes,\r\nmetal is deposited at the negative, and oxide at the positive\r\nelectrode. Manganese is precipitated only as peroxide. The formation\r\nof peroxide is, of course, effected by the ozone found in the\r\nelectrolytic oxygen at the positive pole; the oxide existing in\r\nsolution is brought to a higher degree of oxidation, and is separated\r\nout. Its formation may be decreased or entirely prevented by the\r\naddition of readily oxidizible bodies, such as organic acids, lactose,\r\nglycerine, and preferably by an excess of oxalic acid; but only until\r\nthe organic matter is transformed into carbonic acid. In this manner\r\nClassen separates other metals from manganese in order to prevent the\r\nsaline solutions from being retained by the peroxide.\r\n\r\nWith solutions of silver, bismuth, nickel, and cobalt, it is often\r\npracticable to prevent the separation of oxide by giving the current a\r\ngreater resistance--increasing the distance between the electrodes.\r\n\r\nThe proportion between the quantities of metal and of peroxide\r\ndeposited is not constant, and even if we disregard the concentration\r\nof the solution, the strength of the current and secondary influences\r\n(action of nascent hydrogen) is different in acid and in alkaline\r\nsolutions. In acid solutions much peroxide is formed; in alkaline\r\nliquids, little or none. The reason of the difference is that ozone is\r\nevolved principally in acid solutions, but appears in small quantities\r\nonly in alkaline liquids, or under certain circumstances not at all.\r\nThe quantity of peroxide deposited depends also on the temperature of\r\nthe saline solution; at ordinary temperatures the author obtained more\r\nperoxide--the solution, the time, and the strength of current being\r\nequal--than from a heated liquid. The cause is that ozone is destroyed\r\nby heat and converted into ordinary oxygen. With the exception of lead\r\nand thallium the quantity of metal deposited from an acid solution is\r\nalways greater than that of the peroxide.\r\n\r\n_Lead._--Luckow has shown that from acid solutions--no matter what may\r\nbe the acid--lead is deposited at the anode as a mixture of anhydrous\r\nand hydrated peroxide of variable composition. Only very strongly acid\r\nsolutions let all their lead fall down as peroxide; the precipitation\r\nis rapid immediately on closing the circuit, and complete separation\r\nis effected only in presence of at least 10 per cent. of free nitric\r\nacid. As the current becomes stronger with the increase of free acid,\r\nthere is deposited upon the first compact layer a new stratum of\r\nloosely adhering peroxide.\r\n\r\nIn presence of small quantities of other metals which are thrown down\r\nby the current in the metallic state, such as copper, mercury, etc.,\r\nperoxide alone is deposited from a solution of lead containing small\r\nquantities only of free nitric acid.\r\n\r\nThe lead peroxide deposited is at first light brown or dark red, and\r\nbecomes constantly darker and finally taking a velvet-black. As its\r\nstratification upon the platinum is unequal, it forms beautifully\r\ncolored rings.\r\n\r\nExperiments show that the quantity of peroxide deposited depends on\r\nthe nature of the solution and the strength of the current. In case of\r\nvery feeble currents and slight acidity, its quantity is so small that\r\nit does not need to be taken into consideration. If the lead solution\r\nis very dilute scarcely any current is observed, lead solutions _per\r\nse_ being very bad conductors of electricity.\r\n\r\nFaintly acid concentrated lead solutions give loose peroxide along\r\nwith much spongy metallic lead. Free alkali decreases the separation\r\nof peroxide; feebly alkaline solutions, concentrated and dilute, yield\r\nrelatively much peroxide along with metallic lead, while strongly\r\nalkaline solutions deposit no peroxide.\r\n\r\nDried lead peroxide is so sparingly hygroscopic that it may be weighed\r\nas such; its weight remains constant upon the balance for a long time.\r\nIn order to apply the peroxide for quantitative determinations, a\r\nlarge surface must be exposed to action. As positive electrode a\r\nplatinum capsule is convenient, and a platinum disk as negative pole.\r\nThe capsule shape is necessary because the peroxide when deposited in\r\nlarge quantities adheres only partially, and falls in part in thin\r\nloose scales. It is necessary to siphon off the nitric solution,\r\nsince, like all peroxides, that of lead is not absolutely insoluble in\r\nnitric acid. The methods of Riche and May give results which are\r\nalways too high, since portions of saline solution are retained by the\r\nspongy deposit and can be but very imperfectly removed by washing.\r\nThis is especially the case in presence of free alkali.\r\n\r\nThe author has proceeded as follows: The lead peroxide is dried in the\r\ncapsule, and there is passed over it pure dry gaseous sulphurous acid\r\nin a strong current from a rather narrow delivery tube. Lead sulphate\r\nis formed with evolution of heat; it is let cool under the exsiccator,\r\nand weighed as such. Or he ignites the peroxide along with finely\r\npulverized ammonium sulphite; the mass must have a pure white color.\r\nAfter the conclusion of the reaction it is ignited for about 20\r\nminutes. The results are too high. The proportion of actual lead\r\nperoxide in the deposit ranges from 94 to 94.76 per cent. The peroxide\r\nprecipitated from a nitric solution may, under certain circumstances,\r\nbe anhydrous. This result is due to the secondary influences at the\r\npositive pole, where the free acid gradually withdraws water from the\r\nperoxide.\r\n\r\nThe peroxide thrown down from alkaline solutions retains alkali so\r\nobstinately that it cannot be removed by washing; the peroxide plays\r\nhere the part of an acid. The lead nitrate mechanically inclosed in\r\nthe peroxide is resolved by ignition into oxide, hyponitric acid, and\r\noxygen; this small proportion of lead oxide does not exert an\r\nimportant influence on the final result. The quantity of matter\r\nmechanically inclosed is relatively high, as in the precipitation of\r\nmuch lead peroxide there is relatively more saline matter occluded\r\nthan when a few centigrammes are deposited. The peroxide incloses also\r\nmore foreign matter if it is thrown down upon a small surface than if\r\nit is deposited in a thin layer over a broad surface. From numerous\r\nanalyses the author concludes that in presence of much free nitric\r\nacid the proportion of water is increased; with free alkali the\r\nreverse holds good.\r\n\r\n_Thallium_ behaves similarly to lead. From a nitric acid solution it\r\nis thrown down, according to the proportion of free acid, either as\r\nsesquioxide only or in small quantities as silvery, metallic leaflets;\r\nfrom alkaline solutions it is deposited as sesquioxide and metal, the\r\nlatter of a lead-gray color. Thallium solutions conduct the electric\r\ncurrent badly. Thallium oxide resembles lead peroxide in color; at a\r\nstrong heat it melts, becomes darker, and is converted into peroxide,\r\nin which state it can be weighed.\r\n\r\n_Silver._--All solutions of silver salts, except the nitrate, and\r\nthose containing a very large quantity of free nitric acid or\r\nnitrates, deposit electrolytically merely metallic silver. In the\r\nabove mentioned exceptional cases there is formed a small quantity of\r\nperoxide which adheres to the anode as a blackish-gray deposit. The\r\ngreatest quantity of peroxide is obtained on employing a concentrated,\r\nstrongly acid solution of the nitrate, and a strong current. If the\r\nsolution is very dilute we obtain no peroxide, or mere traces which\r\ndisappear again toward the end of the process. The peroxide is\r\ndeposited at first in small, dark, shining octahedral crystals;\r\nsubsequently, in an amorphous state. At 110° it evolves oxygen\r\nsuddenly, and is converted into metallic silver. It dissolves in\r\nammonia with a violent escape of nitrogen. In nitric acid it dissolves\r\nwithout decomposition and with a red color.\r\n\r\nThe author uses a galvanic current for reducing silver residues,\r\nconsisting of sulphocyanide. The salt is mixed with sulphuric acid in\r\na roomy platinum capsule, and a fine platinum wire gauze is used as\r\npositive electrode.\r\n\r\n_Bismuth._--The current resolves bismuth solutions into metal and\r\nbismutic acid. The latter is deposited at the positive pole, and in\r\nthin layers appears of a golden-yellow, but in thick strata is darker,\r\napproaching to red. Its formation is very gradual, and in time it\r\ndisappears again, owing to secondary actions of the current. On\r\nignition it becomes lemon yellow, and transitorily darker, even brown,\r\nand passes into the sexquioxide.\r\n\r\n_Nickel and Cobalt._--On the electrolysis of the ammonical solution\r\nthe sesquioxide appears at the positive pole. Its formation is\r\nprevented by an excess of ammonia. The author never obtains more than\r\n3½ per cent. of the quantity of the metal. The sesquioxides dissolve\r\nin ammonia without escape of nitrogen, and are usually anhydrous.\r\n\r\n_Manganese._--Manganese is the only metal which is precipitated only\r\nas peroxide. It is deposited at once on closing the circuit, and is at\r\nfirst brown, then black and shining. Organic acids, ferrous oxide,\r\nchromic oxide, ammonium salts, etc., prevent the formation of peroxide\r\nand the red color produced by permanganic acid. In very dilute\r\nstrongly acid nitric solutions there is formed only permanganic acid,\r\nwhich according to Riche is plainly visible in solutions containing\r\n1/1000000 grm. manganese. On electrolyzing a manganiferous solution of\r\ncopper nitrate, red permanganic acid appeared in a stratum floating\r\nabove the platinum disk coated with brown peroxide. No manganese\r\nperoxide was deposited. The peroxide adheres firmly to the platinum\r\nwhen the proportion of free acid is small, not exceeding 3 per cent.,\r\nand the current is not too strong. If the action of the current is\r\nprolonged after the peroxide is thrown down, it falls off in laminæ.\r\nAccording to Riche, in a nitric solution the manganese is deposited as\r\nperoxide, also at the negative pole. This formation is not directly\r\ndue to the current, but is a precipitate occasioned by the production\r\nof ammonia by the reduction of nitric acid. To determine the manganese\r\nin peroxide electrolytically precipitated, it is heated to bright\r\nredness in the platinum capsule until the weight becomes constant. The\r\nresults are too high.\r\n\r\n_Selenium and Tellurium._--Both these bodies are readily and\r\ncompletely reduced by the current either in acid or alkaline\r\nsolutions. Selenium is thrown down at first of a fine brownish red,\r\nwhich gradually becomes darker. The deposit of tellurium is of a\r\nbluish black color. If the current is feeble, the deposit of selenium\r\nis moderately compact; that of tellurium is always loose, and it often\r\nfloats on the liquid. A strong current precipitates both as powders.\r\nThe positive pole is coated during electrolysis with a film of a dark\r\ncolor in case of selenium, but of a lemon yellow with tellurium. As in\r\ncase of arsenic and antimony, the hydrogen evolved at the negative\r\npole combines with the reduced substances, forming hydrogen, selenide,\r\nor telluride, which remain in part in solution in the liquid. The\r\nreduced metal separates out at the anode in a friable\r\ncondition.--_Zeitschrift fur Analytische Chemie, and Chemical News._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ELECTRO-CHEMICAL EQUIVALENT OF SILVER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA very careful and important determination of the electrochemical\r\nequivalent of silver has been made at the observatory of the Physical\r\nInstitute of Würzbourg, and the results are that an ampere current\r\nflowing for a second, or a coulomb of electricity deposits 1.1183\r\nmilligrammes of silver or 0.3281 milligramme of copper, and decomposes\r\n0.09328 milligramme of water, a result agreeing closely with that of\r\nLord Rayleigh recently communicated to the Physical Society. An ampere\r\ntherefore deposits 4.0259 grammes of silver per hour; Kohlrausch's\r\nvalue is 4.0824, a value hitherto accepted universally. This value is\r\nso useful in measuring electric currents with accuracy, and free from\r\nthe disturbances of magnetism, etc., that it is eminently satisfactory\r\nto find the German value agree with that of Lord Rayleigh, which will\r\nprobably be adopted by English electricians.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA NEW STANDARD LIGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\nHerr Hefner-Alteneck has suggested a new standard light for\r\nphotometric purposes, which promises to be very simple and effective\r\nin operation. The light is produced by an open flame of amyl-acetate\r\nburning from a wick of cotton fiber which fills a tube of German\r\nsilver 1 in. long and 316 mils. internal diameter; the external\r\ndiameter being 324 mils. The flame is 1.58 in. high from top to\r\nbottom; and it should be lighted at least ten minutes before using the\r\nlight for testing. A cylindrical glass chimney surrounds it to ward\r\noff air currents. About 2 per cent. of the light is absorbed by the\r\nglass. The power of the flame is that of a standard English candle;\r\nand experiments have shown that amyl acetate, which besides is not\r\nexpensive, is the best fuel for steadiness and brilliance. Neither the\r\nsubstitution of commercial amyl-acetate for pure nor the use of a wick\r\nof cotton thread for loose cotton fiber alters the illuminating power;\r\nbut the wick should be trimmed square across the mouth of the tube,\r\nfor if it project and droop the illuminating power is increased.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[NATURE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. FEUSSNER'S NEW POLARIZING PRISM.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a recent number of the _Zeitschrift fur Instrumentenkunde_ (iv.,\r\n42-50, February, 1884), Dr. K. Feussner of Karlsruhe has given a\r\ndetailed description of a polarizing prism lately devised by him,\r\nwhich presents several points of novelty, and for which certain\r\nadvantages are claimed. The paper also contains an account, although\r\nnot an exhaustive one, of the various polarizing prisms which have\r\nfrom time to time been constructed by means of different combinations\r\nof Iceland spar. The literature of this subject is scattered and\r\nsomewhat difficult of access, and moreover only a small part of it has\r\nhitherto been translated into English; and it would appear therefore\r\nthat a brief abstract of the paper may not be without service to those\r\namong the readers of _Nature_ who may be unacquainted with the\r\noriginal memoirs, or who may not have the necessary references at\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nFollowing the order adopted by Dr. Feussner, the subject may be\r\ndivided into two parts:\r\n\r\n\r\nI.--OLDER FORMS OF POLARIZING PRISMS.\r\n\r\nIn comparing the various forms of polarizing prisms, the main points\r\nwhich need attention are--the angular extent of the field of view, the\r\ndirection of the emergent polarized ray, whether it is shifted to one\r\nside of, or remains symmetrical to the long axis of the prism; the\r\nproportion which the length of the prism bears to its breadth; and\r\nlastly, the position of the terminal faces, whether perpendicular or\r\ninclined to the long axis. These requirements are fulfilled in\r\ndifferent degrees by the following methods of construction:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1., Fig. 2., and Fig. 3.]\r\n\r\n1. _The Nicol Prism_ (_Edin. New Phil. Journal_, 1828, vi., 83).--This\r\n(Fig. 1), as is well known, is constructed from a rhombohedron of\r\nIceland spar, the length of which must be fully three times as great\r\nas the width. The end faces are cut off in such a manner that the\r\nangle of 72° which they originally form with the lateral edge of the\r\nrhombohedron is reduced to 68°. The prism is then cut in two in a\r\nplane perpendicular to the new end surfaces, the section being carried\r\nobliquely from one obtuse corner of the prism to the other, in the\r\ndirection of its length. The surfaces of this section, after having\r\nbeen carefully polished, are cemented together again by means of\r\nCanada balsam. A ray of light, on entering the prism, is separated by\r\nthe double refraction of the calc-spar into an ordinary and an\r\nextraordinary ray; the former undergoes total reflection at the layer\r\nof balsam at an incidence which allows the extraordinary ray to be\r\ntransmitted; the latter, therefore, passes through unchanged. This\r\nprinciple of obtaining a single polarized ray by means of total\r\nreflection of the other is common to all the forms of prism now to be\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\nDr. Feussner gives a mathematical analysis of the paths taken by the\r\ntwo polarized rays within the Nicol prism, and finds that the emergent\r\nextraordinary ray can include an angular field of 29°, but that this\r\nextreme value holds good only for rays incident upon that portion of\r\nthe end surface which is near to the obtuse corner, and that from\r\nthence it gradually decreases until the field includes an angle of\r\nonly about half the previous amount. He finds, moreover, that,\r\nalthough of course the ray emerges parallel to its direction of\r\nincidence, yet that the zone of polarized light is shifted to one side\r\nof the central line. Also that the great length of the Nicol--3.28\r\ntimes its breadth--is not only an inconvenience, but owing to the\r\nlarge pieces of spar thus required for its construction, prisms of any\r\nbut small size become very expensive. To this it may be added that\r\nthere is a considerable loss of light by reflection from the first\r\nsurface, owing to its inclined position in regard to the long axis of\r\nthe prism.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4., Fig. 5., and Fig. 6.]\r\n\r\nIt is with the view of obviating these defects that the modifications\r\nrepresented in Figs. 2 to 6 have been devised.\r\n\r\n2. _The Shortened Nicol Prism_.--This arrangement of the Nicol prism\r\nis constructed by Dr. Steeg and Reuter of Homburg v.d.H. For the sake\r\nof facility of manufacture, the end surfaces are cleavage planes, and\r\nthe oblique cut, instead of being perpendicular, makes with these an\r\nangle of about 84°. By this alteration the prism becomes shorter, and\r\nis now only 2.83 times its breadth; but if Canada balsam is still used\r\nas the cement, the field will occupy a very unsymmetrical position in\r\nregard to the long axis. If balsam of copaiba is made use of, the\r\nindex of refraction of which is 1.50, a symmetrical field of about 24°\r\nwill be obtained. A prism of this kind has also been designed by Prof.\r\nB. Hasert of Eisenach (_Pogg. Ann._, cxiii., 189), but its performance\r\nappears to be inferior to the above.\r\n\r\n3. _The Nicol Prism with Perpendicular Ends._--The terminal surfaces\r\nin this prism are perpendicular to the long axis, and the sectional\r\ncut makes with them an angle of about 75°. The length of the prism is\r\n3.75 times its breadth, and if the cement has an index of refraction\r\nof 1.525, the field is symmetrically disposed, and includes an angle\r\nof 27°. Prisms of this kind have been manufactured by Dr. Steeg, Mr.\r\nC.D. Ahrens, and others.\r\n\r\n4. _The Foucault Prism_ (_Comptes Rendus_, 1857, xlv., 238).--This\r\nconstruction differs from all those hitherto mentioned, in that a film\r\nof air is employed between the two cut surfaces as the totally\r\nreflecting medium instead of a layer of cement. The two halves of the\r\nprism are kept in position, without touching each other, by means of\r\nthe mounting. The length of the prism is in this way much reduced, and\r\namounts to only 1.528 times its breadth. The end surfaces are cleavage\r\nplanes, and the sectional cut makes with them an angle of 59°. The\r\nfield, however, includes not more than about 8°, so that this prism\r\ncan be used only in the case of nearly parallel rays; and in addition\r\nto this the pictures which may be seen through it are to some extent\r\nveiled and indistinct, owing to repeated internal reflection.\r\n\r\n5. _The Hartnack Prism_ (_Ann. de Ch. et de Physique_, ser. iv., vii.,\r\n181).--This form of prism was devised in 1866 by MM. Hartnack and\r\nPrazmowiski; the original memoir is a valuable one; a translation of\r\nit, with some additions, has lately been published (_Journ. of the R.\r\nMicroscopical Soc._, June, 1883, 428). It is considered by Dr.\r\nFeussner to be the most perfect prism capable of being prepared from\r\ncalc-spar. The ends of the prism are perpendicular to its length; the\r\nsection carried through it is in a plane perpendicular to the\r\nprincipal axis of the crystal. The cementing medium is linseed oil,\r\nthe index of refraction of which is 1.485. This form of prism is\r\ncertainly not so well known in this country as it deserves to be; a\r\nvery excellent one, supplied to the present writer by Dr. Steeg is of\r\nrectangular form throughout, the terminal surfaces are 19 × 15 mm.,\r\nand the length 41 mm. The lateral shifting of the field is scarcely\r\nperceptible, the prism is perfectly colorless and transparent, and its\r\nperformance is far superior to that of the ordinary Nicol. The field\r\nof view afforded by this construction depends upon the cementing\r\nsubstance used, and also upon the inclination of the sectional cut in\r\nregard to the end of the prism; it may vary from 20° to 41°. If the\r\nutmost extent of field is not required, the prism may be shortened by\r\nlessening the angle of the section, at the expense, however, of\r\ninterfering with the symmetrical disposition of the field.\r\n\r\n6. _The Glan Prism_ (Carl's \"Repertorium,\" xvi., 570, and xvii.,\r\n195).--This is a modification of the Foucault, and in a similar manner\r\nincludes a film of air between the sectional surfaces. The end\r\nsurfaces and also the cut carried through the prism are parallel to\r\nthe principal axis of the calc-spar. The ends are normal to the\r\nlength, and the field includes about 8°. This prism is very short, and\r\nmay indeed be even shorter than it is broad. It is subject to the same\r\ndefect as that mentioned in the case of the Foucault, although perhaps\r\nnot quite to the same extent.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.--THE NEW POLARIZING PRISM.\r\n\r\nThis prism differs very considerably from the preceding forms, and\r\nconsists of a thin plate of a doubly refracting crystal cemented\r\nbetween two wedge-shaped pieces of glass, the terminal faces of which\r\nare normal to the length. The external form of the prism may thus be\r\nsimilar to the Hartnack, the calc-spar being replaced by glass. The\r\nindices of refraction of the glass and of the cementing medium should\r\ncorrespond with the greater index of refraction of the crystal, and\r\nthe directions of greatest and least elasticity in the latter must\r\nstand in a plane perpendicular to the direction of the section. One of\r\nthe advantages claimed for the new prism is that, it dispenses with\r\nthe large and valuable pieces of spar hitherto found necessary; a\r\nfurther advantage being that other crystalline substances may be used\r\nin this prism instead of calc-spar. The latter advantage, however,\r\noccurs only when the difference between the indices of refraction for\r\nthe ordinary and extraordinary rays in the particular crystal made use\r\nof is greater than in calc-spar. When this is the case, the field\r\nbecomes enlarged, and the length of the prism is reduced.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7.]\r\n\r\nThe substance which Dr. Feussner has employed as being most suitable\r\nfor the separating crystal plate is nitrate of soda (_natronsalpeter_),\r\nin which the above-mentioned values are [omega] = 1.587 and [eta] =\r\n1.336. It crystallizes in similar form to calcite, and in both cases\r\nthin plates obtained by cleavage may be used.\r\n\r\nAs the cementing substance for the nitrate of soda, a mixture of gum\r\ndammar with monobromonaphthalene was used, which afforded an index of\r\nrefraction of 1.58. In the case of thin plates of calcite, a solid\r\ncementing substance of sufficiently high refractive power was not\r\navailable, and a fluid medium was therefore employed. For this purpose\r\nthe whole prism was inclosed in a short glass tube with airtight ends,\r\nwhich was filled with monobromonaphthalene. In an experimental prism a\r\nmixture of balsam of tolu was made use of, giving a cement with an\r\nindex of refraction of 1.62, but the low refractive power resulted in\r\na very considerable reduction of the field. The extent and disposition\r\nof the field may be varied by altering the inclination at which the\r\ncrystal lamina is inserted (Fig. 7), and thereby reducing the length\r\nof the prism, as in the case of the Hartnack.\r\n\r\nIn order to obviate the effects of reflection from the internal side\r\nsurfaces if the prism, the wedge-shaped blocks of glass of which it is\r\nbuilt up may be made much broader than would otherwise be necessary;\r\nthe edges of this extra width are cut obliquely and suitably\r\nblackened.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying diagram (Fig. 8) represents a prism of cylindrical\r\nexternal form constructed in this manner, the lower surface being that\r\nof the incident light. In this the field amounts to 30°, and the\r\nbreadth is about double the length.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8.]\r\n\r\nDr. Feussner remarks that a prism similar in some respects to his new\r\narrangement was devised in 1869 by M. Jamin (_Comptes Rendus_,\r\nlxviii., 221), who used a thin plate of calc-spar inclosed in a cell\r\nfilled with bisulphide of carbon; and also by Dr. Zenker, who replaced\r\nthe liquid in M. Jamin's construction by wedges of flint glass.\r\n\r\nAmong others, the carefully considered modifications of the Nicol\r\nprism which have recently been devised by Prof. S.P. Thompson (_Phil.\r\nMag._, November, 1881, 349, and _Jour. R. Micros. Soc._, August, 1883,\r\n575), and by Mr. R.T. Glazebrook (_Phil. Mag._, May, 1883, 352), do\r\nnot appear to have been known to Dr. Feussner.\r\n\r\nThe following tabular view of different forms of polarizing prisms is\r\ntaken from the conclusion of Dr. Feussner's paper:\r\n\r\n  ---------------------------------------+------+---------+------+------\r\n                                         |      |Inclina- |Ratio |\r\n                                         |      |tion of  | of   |\r\n                                         |      |section  |length|\r\n                                         |      |in regard| to   |\r\n                                         |      |to long  |clear |\r\n                                         |Field.|axis.    |width.|Fig.\r\n  ---------------------------------------+------+---------+------+------\r\n  I.

So far as an analyzer is\r\nconcerned, the experience of the writer of this notice would lead to\r\nthe opinion that improvements are to be looked for rather in the way\r\nof the discovery of an artificial crystal which absorbs one of the\r\npolarized rays than by further modifications depending upon total\r\nreflection. The researches of Dr. Herapath on iodosulphate of quinine\r\n(_Phil. Mag._, March, 1852, 161, and November, 1853, 346) are in this\r\ndirection; but crystals of the so-called herapathite require great\r\nmanipulative skill for their production. If these could be readily\r\nobtained of sufficient size, they would be invaluable as analyzers.\r\n\r\nThis opinion is supported by the existence of an inconvenience which\r\nattends every form of analyzing prism. It is frequently, and\r\nespecially in projecting apparatus, required to be placed at the focus\r\nof a system of lenses, so that the rays may cross in the interior of\r\nthe prism. This is an unfavorable position for a prismatic analyzer,\r\nand in the case of a powerful beam of light, such as that from the\r\nelectric arc, the crossing of the rays within the prism is not\r\nunattended with danger to the cementing substance, and to the surfaces\r\nin contact with it.\r\n\r\nPHILIP R. SLEEMAN.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nZIRCON.\r\n\r\nBy F. STOLBA.\r\n\r\n\r\nFinely ground zircon is quickly rendered soluble if fused with a\r\nmixture of potassium borofluoride and potassium carbonate. The author\r\ntakes two parts of the former to three of the latter, and prepares an\r\nintimate, finely divided mixture, which is kept ready for use.\r\n\r\nOf this mixture four parts are taken to one of zircon, thoroughly\r\nmixed, and melted in a platinum crucible at a red heat. The mass fuses\r\nreadily, froths at first and gives off bubbles of gas, and flows then\r\nquietly, forming a very fluid melt. If the zircon is finely ground, 15\r\nminutes are sufficient for this operation. The loss of weight is 16\r\nper cent., and is not notably increased on prolonged fusion. It\r\ncorresponds approximately to the weight of the carbonic anhydride\r\npresent in the potassium carbonate.\r\n\r\nAs pungent vapors are given off during fusion, the operation should be\r\nconducted under a draught hood. The activity of the mixture in\r\nattacking zircon appears from the following experiment: Two zircon\r\ncrystals, each weighing ½ grm., were introduced into the melted\r\nmixture and subjected to prolonged heat. In a short time they\r\ndecreased perceptibly in size; each of them broke up into two\r\nfragments, and within an hour they were entirely dissolved. The melted\r\nmass is poured upon a dry metal plate, and when congealed is thrown\r\ninto water. It is at once intersected with a number of fissures, which\r\nfacilitate pulverization. This process is the more necessary as the\r\nunbroken mass is very slowly attacked by water even on prolonged\r\nboiling. The powder is boiled in a large quantity of water so as to\r\nremove everything soluble. There is obtained a faintly alkaline\r\nsolution and a sediment insoluble in water. From the filtrate alkalies\r\nthrow down zirconium hydroxide, free from iron.\r\n\r\nThe portion insoluble in water is readily dissolved in hydrofluoric\r\nacid, and is converted into zircon potassium fluoride. The chief bulk\r\nof the zirconium is found in the aqueous solution in the state of\r\ndouble fluorides. The platinum crucible is not in the least attacked\r\nduring melting. On the contrary, dirty platinum crucibles may be\r\nadvantageously cleaned by melting in them a little of the above\r\nmentioned mixture.\r\n\r\nIf finely divided zircon is boiled for a long time with caustic lye,\r\nit is perceptibly attacked. It is very probable that in this manner\r\nzircon might be entirely dissolved under a pressure of 10 atmospheres.\r\n\r\nPotassium borofluoride may be readily prepared from cryolite.\r\nCrucibles of nickel seem especially well adapted for the fusion of\r\nzircon in caustic alkalies.--_Ber.

Ward, A.M.,\r\n   M.E., February, 1884.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe numerous direct processes which have been patented and brought\r\nbefore the iron masters of the world, differ materially from that now\r\nintroduced by Mr. Wilson. After a careful examination of his process,\r\nI am convinced that Mr. Wilson has succeeded in producing good blooms\r\nfrom iron ore, and I think that I am able to point out theoretically\r\nthe chief reasons of the success of his method.\r\n\r\nWithout going deeply into the history of the metal, I may mention the\r\nwell known fact that wrought iron was extensively used in almost all\r\nquarters of the globe, before pig or cast iron was ever produced.\r\nWithout entering into the details of the processes by which this\r\nwrought iron was made, it suffices for my present purpose to say that\r\nthey were crude, wasteful, and expensive, so that they can be employed\r\nto-day only in a very few localities favored with good and cheap ore,\r\nfuel, and labor.\r\n\r\nThe construction of larger furnaces and the employment of higher\r\ntemperatures led to the production of a highly carbonized, fusible\r\nmetal, without any special design on the part of the manufacturers in\r\nproducing it. This pig iron, however, could be used only for a few\r\npurposes for which metallic iron was needed; but it was produced\r\ncheaply and with little loss of metal, and the attempt to decarbonize\r\nthis product and bring it into a state in which it could be hammered\r\nand welded was soon successfully made. This process of decarbonization,\r\nor some modification of it, has successfully held the field against\r\nall so-called, direct processes up to the present time. Why? Because\r\nthe old fashioned bloomeries and Catalan forges could produce blooms\r\nonly at a high cost, and because the new processes introduced failed\r\nto turn out good blooms. Those produced were invariably \"red short,\"\r\nthat is, they contained unreduced oxide of iron, which prevented the\r\ncontact of the metallic particles, and rendered the welding together\r\nof these particles to form a solid bloom impossible.\r\n\r\nThe process of puddling cast iron, and transforming it by\r\ndecarbonization into wrought iron, has, as everybody knows, been in\r\nsuccessful practical operation for many years, and the direct process\r\nreferred to so closely resembles this, that a short description of the\r\ntheory of puddling is not out of place here.\r\n\r\nThe material operated on in puddling is iron containing from 2½ to 4\r\nper cent. of carbon. During the first stage of the process this iron\r\nis melted down to a fluid bath in the bottom of a reverberatory\r\nfurnace. Then the oxidation of the carbon contained in the iron\r\ncommences, and at the same time a fluid, basic cinder, or slag, is\r\nproduced, which covers a portion of the surface of the metal bath, and\r\nprevents too hasty oxidation. This slag results from the union of\r\noxides of iron with the sand adhering to the pigs, and the silica\r\nresulting from the oxidation of the silicon contained in the iron.\r\n\r\nThis cinder now plays a very important part in the process. It takes\r\nup the oxides of iron formed by the contact of the oxidizing flame\r\nwith the exposed portion of the metal bath, and at the same time the\r\ncarbon of the iron, coming in contact with the under surface of the\r\ncinder covering, where it is protected from oxidizing influences,\r\nreduces these oxides from the cinder and restores them to the bath in\r\nmetallic form. This alternate oxidation of exposed metal, and its\r\nreduction by the carbon of the cast iron, continues till the carbon is\r\nnearly exhausted, when the iron assumes a pasty condition, or \"comes\r\nto nature,\" as the puddlers call this change. The charge is then\r\nworked up into balls, and removed for treatment in the squeezer, and\r\nthen hammered or rolled. In the Wilson process the conditions which we\r\nhave noted in the puddling operation are very closely approximated.\r\nIron ore reduced to a coarse sand is mixed with the proper proportion\r\nof charcoal or coke dust, and the mixture fed into upright retorts\r\nplaced in the chimney of the puddling furnace. By exposure for 24\r\nhours to the heat of the waste gases from the furnace, in the presence\r\nof solid carbon, a considerable portion of the oxygen of the ore is\r\nremoved, but little or no metallic iron is formed. The ore is then\r\ndrawn from the deoxidizer into the rear or second hearth of the\r\npuddling furnace, situated below it, where it is exposed for 20\r\nminutes to a much higher temperature than that of the deoxidizer. Here\r\nthe presence of the solid carbon, mixed with the ore, prevents any\r\noxidizing action, and the temperature of the mass is raised to a point\r\nat which the cinder begins to form. Then the charge is carried forward\r\nby the workmen to the front hearth, in which the temperature of a\r\npuddling furnace prevails. Here the cinder melts, and at the same\r\ntime the solid carbon reacts on the oxygen remaining combined with the\r\nore, and forms metallic iron; but by this time the molten cinder is\r\npresent to prevent undue oxidation of the metal formed, and solid\r\ncarbon is still present in the mixture to play the same role, of\r\nreducing protoxide of iron from the cinder, as the carbon of the cast\r\niron does in the ordinary puddling process. I have said that the cast\r\niron used as the material for puddling contains about 3 per cent. of\r\ncarbon; but in this process sufficient carbon is added to effect the\r\nreduction of the ore to a metallic state, and leave enough in the mass\r\nto play the part of the carbon of the cast iron when the metallic\r\nstage has been reached.\r\n\r\nIt would be interesting to compare the Wilson with the numerous other\r\ndirect processes to which allusion has already been made, but there\r\nhave been so many of them, and the data concerning them are so\r\nincomplete, that this is impossible. Two processes, however, the Blair\r\nand the Siemens, have attracted sufficient attention, and are\r\nsufficiently modern to deserve notice. In the Blair process a metallic\r\niron sponge was made from the ore in a closed retort, this sponge\r\ncooled down in receptacles from which the air was excluded, to the\r\ntemperature of the atmosphere, then charged into a puddling furnace\r\nand heated for working. In this way (and the same plan essentially has\r\nbeen followed by other inventors), the metallic iron, in the finest\r\npossible state of subdivision, is subjected to the more or less\r\noxidizing influences of the flame, without liquid slag to save it from\r\noxidation, and with no carbon present to again reduce the iron oxides\r\nfrom the cinder after it is formed. The loss of metal is consequently\r\nvery large, but oxides of iron being left in the metal the blooms are\r\ninvariably \"red short.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Siemens process pieces of ore of the size of beans or peas,\r\nmixed with lime or other fluxing material, form the charge, which is\r\nintroduced into a rotating furnace; and when this charge has become\r\nheated to a bright-red heat, small coal of uniform size is added in\r\nsufficient quantity to effect the reduction of the ore.\r\n\r\nThe size of the pieces of the material employed prevents the intimate\r\nmixture of the particles of iron with the particles of carbon, and\r\nhence we would, on theoretical grounds, anticipate just what practice\r\nhas proved, viz., that the reduction is incomplete, and the resulting\r\nmetal being charged with oxides is red-short. In practice, blooms made\r\nby this process have been so red-short that they could not be hammered\r\nat all.\r\n\r\nIt would be impracticable in this process to employ ore and carbon in\r\nas fine particles as Wilson does, as a very large portion of the\r\ncharge would be carried off by the draught, and a sticking of the\r\nmaterial to the sides of the rotating furnace could scarcely be\r\navoided. I do not imagine that a division of the material into\r\nanything like the supposed size of molecules is necessary; we know\r\nthat the graphitic carbon in the pig-iron employed in puddling is not\r\nso finely divided, but it is much smaller particles than bean or pea\r\nsize, and by approximating the size of the graphite particles in pig\r\niron, Wilson has succeeded in obtaining good results.\r\n\r\nIf we examine the utilization of the heat developed by the combustion\r\nof a given quantity of coal in this process, and compare it with the\r\nresult of the combustion of an equivalent amount of fuel in a blast\r\nfurnace, we shall soon see the theoretical economy of the process. The\r\ncoal is burned on the grate of the puddling-furnace, to carbonic acid,\r\nand the flame is more fully utilized than in an ordinary\r\npuddling-furnace, for besides the ordinary hearth there is the second\r\nor rear hearth, where additional heat is taken up, and then the\r\nproducts of combustion are further utilized in heating the retorts in\r\nwhich the ore is partly reduced. After this the heat is still further\r\nutilized by passing it under the boilers for the generation of steam,\r\nand the heat lost in the gases, when they finally escape, is very\r\nsmall. In a blast furnace the carbon is at first burned only to\r\ncarbonic oxide, and the products of combustion issue mainly in this\r\nform from the top of the furnace. Then a portion of the heat resulting\r\nfrom the subsequent burning of these gases is pretty well utilized in\r\nmaking steam to supply the power required about the works, but the\r\nrest of the gas can only be utilized for heating the blast, and here\r\nthere is an enormous waste, the amount of heat returned to the furnace\r\nby the heated blast being very small in proportion to the amount\r\ngenerated by the burning of that portion of carbonic oxide expended in\r\nheating it, and the gases escape from both the hot-blast and the\r\nboilers at a high temperature.\r\n\r\nIn the direct process under consideration the fuel burned is more\r\ncompletely utilized than in the puddling process, to which the cast\r\niron from the blast furnace is subjected to convert it into wrought\r\niron.\r\n\r\nThe economy claimed for this process, over the blast furnace and\r\npuddling practice for the production of wrought iron, is that nearly\r\nall the fuel used in the puddling operation is saved, and that with\r\nabout the same amount of fuel used in the blast furnace to produce a\r\nton of pig iron, a ton of wrought iron blooms can be made. I had no\r\nopportunity of weighing the charges of ore and coal used, but I saw\r\nthe process in actual operation at Rockaway, N.J. The iron produced\r\nwas hammered up into good solid blooms, containing but little cinder.\r\nThe muck-bar made from the blooms was fibrous in fracture, and showed\r\nevery appearance of good iron. I am informed by the manager of the\r\nSanderson Brothers' steel works, at Syracuse, N.Y., that they\r\npurchased blooms made by the Wilson process in 1881-1882, that _none_\r\nof them showed red-shortness, and that they discontinued their use\r\nonly on account of the injurious action of the titanium they contained\r\non the melting pots. These blooms were made from magnetic sands from\r\nthe Long Island and Connecticut coasts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NEW PROCESS FOR MAKING WROUGHT IRON FROM THE ORE.]\r\n\r\nThe drawing given shows the construction of the furnace employed. I\r\nquote from the published description:\r\n\r\n    \"The upper part, or deoxidizer, is supported on a strong\r\n    mantel plate resting on four cast iron columns.\r\n\r\n    \"The retorts and flues are made entirely of fire-brick, from\r\n    special patterns. The outside is protected by a wrought iron\r\n    jacket made of No. 14 iron. The puddling furnace is of the\r\n    ordinary construction, except in the working bottom, which is\r\n    made longer to accommodate two charges of ore, and thus\r\n    utilize more of the waste heat in reducing the ore to metallic\r\n    iron.\r\n\r\n    \"The operation of the furnace is as follows: The pulverized\r\n    ore is mixed with 20 per cent. of pulverized charcoal or coke,\r\n    and is fed into an elevator which discharges into the hopper\r\n    on the deoxidizer leading into the retorts marked C. These\r\n    retorts are proportioned so that they will hold ore enough to\r\n    run the puddling furnace 24 hours, the time required for\r\n    perfect deoxidation. After the retorts are filled, a fire is\r\n    started in the furnace, and the products of combustion pass up\r\n    through the main flue, or well, B, where they are deflected by\r\n    the arch, and pass out through suitable openings, as indicated\r\n    by arrows, into the down-takes marked E, and out through an\r\n    annular flue, where they are passed under a boiler.\r\n\r\n    \"It will be noticed that the ore is exposed to the waste heat\r\n    on three sides of the retorts, and owing to the great surface\r\n    so exposed, the ore is very thoroughly deoxidized, and reduced\r\n    in the retorts before it is introduced into the puddling\r\n    furnace for final reduction. The curved cast iron pipes marked\r\n    D are provided with slides, and are for the purpose of\r\n    introducing the deoxidized ore into the second bottom of the\r\n    furnace. As before stated, the furnace is intended to\r\n    accommodate two charges of ore, and as fast as it is balled up\r\n    and taken out of the working bottom, the charge remaining in\r\n    the second bottom is worked up in the place occupied by the\r\n    first charge, and a _new_ charge is introduced. As fast as the\r\n    ore is drawn out from the retorts the elevator supplies a new\r\n    lot, so that the retorts are always filled, thus making the\r\n    process continuous.\"\r\n\r\nThe temperature of the charge in the deoxidizer is from 800° to 1,000°\r\nF.--_Amer.

A perfectly normal lather was obtained when soap had been\r\nadded in quantities sufficient to neutralize 14° of hardness, whereas\r\nthe water contained salts of calcium and magnesium equivalent, on\r\nClark's scale, to a hardness of 27°.\r\n\r\nAlthough I was aware that similar observations had been made before, I\r\nthought that it might be useful to determine the conditions under\r\nwhich the soap test could not be depended upon for reliable results.\r\n\r\nI found with waters containing calcium or magnesium alone that,\r\nwhenever salts of either of these metals were in solution in\r\nquantities sufficient to give 23° of hardness on Clark's scale, no\r\ndependence could be placed upon the results given by the soap test. In\r\nthe case of waters containing salts of both calcium and magnesium, I\r\nfound that if the salts of the latter metal were in solution in\r\nquantities sufficient to give more than 10° of hardness, no evidence\r\ncould be obtained of their presence so long as the salts of calcium in\r\nthe same water exceeded 6°; in such a case a perfect and permanent\r\nlather was produced when soap had been added equivalent to 7° of\r\nhardness.\r\n\r\nIf any water be diluted so as to reduce the proportions of the salts\r\nof calcium and magnesium below those stated above, perfectly reliable\r\nresults will of course be obtained.\r\n\r\nInstead of dilution I found that heating the water to about 70° C. was\r\nsufficient to cause a complete reaction between the soap and the salts\r\nof calcium and magnesium, even if these were present in far larger\r\nquantities than any given here.\r\n\r\nThe experiments so far had all been made with a solution of Castile\r\nsoap of the strength suggested by Mr. Wanklyn in his book on \"Water\r\nAnalysis.\" My attention was next directed to the use of any one of the\r\ncompounds of which such a soap is composed. I commenced with sodium\r\noleate, and found that by employing this substance in a moderately\r\npure condition, perfectly reliable results could be obtained in very\r\nhard waters without the trouble of either diluting or heating. I was\r\nunable to try sodium stearate directly because of the slight\r\nsolubility of this substance in cold water or dilute alcohol; but I\r\nfound that a mixture of sodium oleate and stearate behaved in exactly\r\nthe same manner as the Castile soap.\r\n\r\nI am not prepared at present to state the exact reaction which takes\r\nplace between salts of calcium and magnesium and a compound soap\r\ncontaining sodium oleate and stearate. I publish these results because\r\nI have not noticed anywhere the fact that some waters show a greater\r\nhardness with soap when their temperatures approach the boiling point\r\nthan they do at the average temperature of the air, it being, I\r\nbelieve, the ordinary impression that cold water wastes more soap than\r\nhot water before a good and useful lather can be obtained, whereas\r\nwith very many waters the case is quite the reverse. Neither am I\r\naware at present whether it is well known that the use of sodium\r\noleate unmixed with sodium stearate dispenses with the process of\r\ndilution even in very hard waters.--_Chem.

Berthelot and Vielle have recently been studying the influence of\r\nthe density of detonating gaseous mixtures upon the pressure\r\ndeveloped. The measure of pressure developed by the same gaseous\r\nsystem, taken under two initial states of different density to which\r\nthe same quantity of heat is communicated, is an important matter in\r\nthermodynamics. If the pressures vary in the same ratio as the\r\ndensities, we may conclude, independently of all special hypotheses on\r\nthe laws of gases, first, that the specific heat of the system is\r\nindependent of its density (that is to say, of its initial pressure),\r\nand depends only on the absolute temperature, whatever that may mean;\r\nand secondly, that the relative variation of the pressure at constant\r\nvolume, produced by the introduction of a determinate quantity of\r\nheat, is also independent of the pressure, and a function only of the\r\ntemperature. Lastly, the pressure itself will vary proportionally with\r\nthe absolute temperature, as defined by the theory of a perfect gas,\r\nand will serve to determine it. MM. Berthelot and Vielle operated with\r\na bomb, at first kept at ordinary temperatures in the air, and\r\nafterward heated in an oil bath to 153 deg. Cent. They also employed\r\nisomeric mixtures of the gases; methylic ether, cyanogen, hydrogen,\r\nacetylene, and other gases were experimented upon, and the general\r\nconclusions are as follows: 1. The same quantity of heat being\r\nfurnished to a gaseous system, the pressure of the system varies\r\nproportionally to the density of the system. 2. The specific heat of\r\nthe gas is sensibly independent of the density as well toward very\r\nhigh temperatures as about deg. Cent. This is all true for densities\r\nnear to those that the gas possesses cold under normal pressure, and\r\nwhich varied in the experiment to double the original value. 3. The\r\npressure increases with the quantity of heat furnished to the same\r\nsystem. 4. The apparent specific heat increases parallel with this\r\nquantity of heat. These conclusions are independent of all hypotheses\r\non the nature and laws of gases, and were simply drawn from the\r\nexperiments in question.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTURKISH BATHS FOR HORSES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Turkish bath has become an established institution in this\r\ncountry; men of all classes now use it for sanitary as well as\r\nremedial purposes. Athletes of various descriptions find it invaluable\r\nin \"training,\" and all the distinguished jockeys and light weights\r\nkeep themselves in condition by its use.\r\n\r\nIt was thought probable that what was good for man might also be good\r\nfor the horse, and the fact has been proved. Messrs. Pickford, the\r\neminent carriers, in their hospital for horses at Finchley, have had a\r\nbath in operation over eleven years, and find the horses derive great\r\nbenefit from its use. The bath is put in operation three days a week,\r\nand is administered to over twenty horses in this time. The value of\r\nthe bath having been thus proved, it is rather strange that it has not\r\nbeen more generally adopted by the large carrying firms. However, the\r\nGreat Northern Railway Company at their new hospital for horses at\r\nTotteridge, are erecting a very complete Turkish bath. It consists of\r\nthree rooms. First, a large wash room or grooming room, from which is\r\nentered the first hot room, or tepidarium, from 140° to 150° Fahr.;\r\nfrom this room, the horse, after being thoroughly acclimated, can, if\r\nnecessary, pass to the hottest room, or calidarium, from 160° to 170°\r\nFahr., and without any turning round can pass on into the grooming and\r\nwashing room again. This last room is slightly heated from the two\r\nother rooms, and in each are stocks in which the animal can he\r\nfastened if required. The heating is done most economically by\r\nConstantine's convoluted stove, and thorough ventilation is secured\r\nfrom the large volume of hot air constantly supplied, which passes\r\nthrough the baths, and as it becomes vitiated is drawn off by\r\nspecially designed outlets. The wash room is supplied with hot and\r\ncold water, which can, of course, be mixed to any required\r\ntemperature.--_Building News._\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n   ||\r\n   |+-------------------------------------------------------+\r\n   |+-------------------++---__-------____------------__---+|\r\n   ||                   ||FOUL AIR  FOUL AIR       FOUL AIR||\r\n   ||                   ||                                 ||\r\n   ||                   ||                                 ||\r\n   ||                   ||         ==============          ||\r\n   ||                  /     /                             ||\r\n   ||                 /     /       1ST HOT ROOM           ||\r\n   ||                /     /                               ||\r\n   ||               /     /        ==============          ||\r\n   ||                   ||                                 ||\r\n   /         =======+   ||                                 ||\r\n  /                ||   ||                          CURTAIN||\r\n       WASHING ROOM||   |+===========================     =||\r\n  \\                ||   ||                                 ||\r\n   \\         =======+   ||                                 ||\r\n   ||                   ||                                 ||\r\n   ||               \\     \\        ==============          ||\r\n   ||                \\     \\                               ||\r\n   ||                 \\     \\       2ND HOT ROOM           ||  FRESH\r\n   ||                  \\     \\                             || / AIR\r\n   ||                   ||         ==============          ||==\r\n   ||                   ||                          +======||  |\r\n   ||                   ||                          | WARM ||  |\r\n   ||                   ||FOUL AIR          FOUL AIR| AIR  ||  |\r\n   |+-------------------++---__--+===+---------__----------+|==\r\n   |+----------------------------|_|_|---------------------+|\r\n   ||      |     ||||| |                                   ||\r\n   ||      |     ||||| |                                   ||\r\n   ||      |============           S T O K E R Y           ||\r\n   ||                 ||                                   ||\r\n   ||                 ||                                   ||\r\n   ||                 |+-----------------------------------||\r\n                      +-------------------------------------+\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMIRYACHIT, A NEWLY DESCRIBED DISEASE OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM, AND\r\nITS ANALOGUES.[1]\r\n\r\n   [Footnote 1: Read before the New York Neurological Society,\r\n   February 5, 1884.]\r\n\r\nBy WILLIAM A. HAMMOND, M.D., Surgeon-General, U.S. Army (Retired\r\nList); Professor of Diseases of the Mind and Nervous System in the New\r\nYork Post-Graduate Medical School and Hospital.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a very interesting account of a journey from the Pacific Ocean\r\nthrough Asia to the United States, by Lieutenant B.H. Buckingham and\r\nEnsigns George C. Foulk and Walter McLean,[2] United States navy, I\r\nfind an affection of the nervous system described which, on account of\r\nits remarkable characteristics, as well as by reason of certain known\r\nanalogies, I think should be brought to the special notice of the\r\nmedical profession. I quote from the work referred to, the following\r\naccount of this disease. The party is on the Ussuri River not far from\r\nits junction with the Amur in Eastern Siberia: \"While we were walking\r\non the bank here we observed our messmate, the captain of the general\r\nstaff (of the Russian army), approach the steward of the boat\r\nsuddenly, and, without any apparent reason or remark, clap his hands\r\nbefore his face; instantly the steward clapped _his_ hands in the same\r\nmanner, put on an angry look, and passed on. The incident was somewhat\r\ncurious, as it involved a degree of familiarity with the steward\r\nhardly to have been expected. After this we observed a number of queer\r\nperformances of the steward, and finally comprehended the situation.\r\nIt seemed that he was afflicted with a peculiar mental or nervous\r\ndisease, which forced him to imitate everything suddenly presented to\r\nhis senses. Thus, when the captain slapped the paddle-box suddenly in\r\nthe presence of the steward, the latter instantly gave it a similar\r\nthump; or, if any noise were made suddenly, he seemed compelled\r\nagainst his will to imitate it instantly, and with remarkable\r\naccuracy. To annoy him, some of the passengers imitated pigs grunting,\r\nor called out absurd names; others clapped their hands and shouted,\r\njumped, or threw their hats on the deck suddenly, and the poor\r\nsteward, suddenly startled, would echo them all precisely, and\r\nsometimes several consecutively. Frequently he would expostulate,\r\nbegging people not to startle him, and again would grow furiously\r\nangry, but even in the midst of his passion he would helplessly\r\nimitate some ridiculous shout or motion directed at him by his\r\npitiless tormenters. Frequently he shut himself up in his pantry,\r\nwhich was without windows, and locked the door, but even there he\r\ncould be heard answering the grunts, shouts, or pounds on the bulkhead\r\noutside. He was a man of middle age, fair physique, rather intelligent\r\nin facial expression, and without the slightest indication in\r\nappearance of his disability. As we descended the bank to go on board\r\nthe steamer, some one gave a loud shout and threw his cap on the\r\nground; looking about for the steward, for the shout was evidently\r\nmade for his benefit, we saw him violently throw his cap, with a\r\nshout, into a chicken-coop, into which he was about to put the result\r\nof his foraging expedition among the houses of the stanitza.\r\n\r\n   [Footnote 2: \"Observations upon the Korean Coast, Japanese-Korean\r\n   Ports, and Siberia, made during a journey from the Asiatic\r\n   Station to the United States, through Siberia to Europe, June 3\r\n   to September 8, 1882.\" Published by the United States Navy\r\n   Department, Washington, 1883, pp. 51.]\r\n\r\n\"We afterward witnessed an incident which illustrated the extent of\r\nhis disability. The captain of the steamer, running up to him,\r\nsuddenly clapping his hands at the same time, accidentally slipped and\r\nfell hard on the deck; without having been touched by the captain, the\r\nsteward instantly clapped his bands and shouted, and then, in\r\npowerless imitation, he too fell as hard and almost precisely in the\r\nsame manner and position as the captain. In speaking of the steward's\r\ndisorder, the captain of the general staff stated that it was not\r\nuncommon in Siberia; that he had seen a number of cases of it, and\r\nthat it was commonest about Yakutsk, where the winter cold is extreme.\r\nBoth sexes were subject to it, but men much less than women. It was\r\nknown to Russians by the name of 'miryachit'\".\r\n\r\nSo far as I am aware--and I have looked carefully through several\r\nbooks of travel in Siberia--no account of this curious disease has\r\nbeen hitherto published.\r\n\r\nThe description given by the naval officers at once, however, brings\r\nto mind the remarks made by the late Dr. George M. Beard, before the\r\nmeeting of the American Neurological Association in 1880, relative to\r\nthe \"Jumpers\" or \"Jumping Frenchmen\" of Maine and northern New\r\nHampshire.[3]\r\n\r\n   [Footnote 3: \"Journal of Nervous and Mental Diseases,\" vol. vii.,\r\n   1880, p. 487.]\r\n\r\nIn June, 1880, Dr. Beard visited Moosehead Lake, found the \"Jumpers,\"\r\nand experimented with them. He ascertained that whatever order was\r\ngiven them was at once obeyed. Thus, one of the jumpers who was\r\nsitting in a chair with a knife in his hand was told to throw it, and\r\nhe threw it quickly, so that it stuck in a beam opposite; at the same\r\ntime he repeated the order to throw it with a cry of alarm not unlike\r\nthat of hysteria or epilepsy. He also threw away his pipe, which he\r\nwas filling with tobacco, when he was slapped upon the shoulder. Two\r\njumpers standing near each other were told to strike, and they struck\r\neach other very forcibly. One jumper, when standing by a window, was\r\nsuddenly commanded by a person on the other side of the window to\r\njump, and he jumped up half a foot from the floor, repeating the\r\norder. When the commands are uttered in a quick, loud voice, the\r\njumper repeats the order. When told to strike he strikes, when told to\r\nthrow he throws whatever he may happen to have in his hand. Dr. Beard\r\ntried this power of repetition with the first part of the first line\r\nof Virgil's \"Æneid\" and the first part of the first line of Homer's\r\n\"Iliad,\" and out-of-the-way words of the English language with which\r\nthe jumper could not be familiar, and he repeated or echoed the sound\r\nof the word as it came to him in a quick, sharp voice, at the same\r\ntime he jumped, or struck, or threw, or raised his shoulders, or made\r\nsome other violent muscular motion. They could not help repeating the\r\nword or sound that came from the person that ordered them, any more\r\nthan they could help striking, dropping, throwing, jumping, or\r\nstarting; all of these phenomena were indeed but parts of the general\r\ncondition known as jumping. It was not necessary that the sound should\r\ncome from a human being; any sudden or unexpected noise, as the\r\nexplosion of a gun or pistol, the falling of a window, or the slamming\r\nof a door--provided it was unexpected and loud enough--would cause\r\nthese jumpers to exhibit some one or all of these phenomena. One of\r\nthese jumpers came very near cutting his throat, while shaving, on\r\nhearing a door slam. They had been known to strike their fists against a\r\nred-hot stove, to jump into the fire and into water. They could not\r\nhelp striking their best friend if near them when ordered. The noise\r\nof a steam whistle was especially obnoxious to them. One of these\r\njumpers, when taking some bromide of sodium in a tumbler, was told to\r\nthrow it, and he dashed the tumbler upon the floor. It was dangerous\r\nto startle them in any way when they had an ax or an knife in their\r\nhands. All of the jumpers agreed that it tired them to be jumped, and\r\nthey dreaded it, but they were constantly annoyed by their companions.\r\n\r\nFrom this description it will at once, I think, be perceived that\r\nthere are striking analogies between \"miryachit\" and this disorder of\r\nthe \"Jumping Frenchmen\" of Maine. Indeed, it appears to me that, if\r\nthe two affections were carefully studied, it would be found that they\r\nwere identical, or that, at any rate, the phenomena of the one could\r\nreadily be developed into those of the others. It is not stated that\r\nthe subjects of miryachit do what they are told to do. They require an\r\nexample to reach their brains through the sense of sight or that of\r\nhearing, whereas the \"Jumpers\" do not apparently perform an act which\r\nis executed before them, but they require a command. It seems,\r\nhowever, that a \"Jumper\" starts whenever any sudden noise reaches his\r\nears.\r\n\r\nIn both classes of cases a suggestion of some kind is required, and\r\nthen the act takes place independently of the will. There is another\r\nanalogous condition known by the Germans as _Schlaftrunkenheit_, and\r\nto English and American neurologists as somnolentia, or\r\nsleep-drunkenness. In this state an individual, on being suddenly\r\nawakened, commits some incongruous act of violence, ofttimes a murder.\r\nSometimes this appears to be excited by a dream, but in others no such\r\ncause could be discovered.\r\n\r\nThus, a sentry fell asleep during his watch, and, being suddenly\r\naroused by the officer in command, attacked the latter with his sword,\r\nand would have killed him but for the interposition of the bystanders.\r\nThe result of the medical examination was that the act was\r\ninvoluntary, being the result of a violent confusion of mind\r\nconsequent upon the sudden awaking from a profound sleep. Other cases\r\nare cited by Wharton and Stille in their work on medical\r\njurisprudence, by Hoffbauer, and by myself in \"Sleep and its\r\nDerangements.\"\r\n\r\nThe following cases among others have occurred in my own experience:\r\n\r\nA gentleman was roused one night by his wife, who heard the\r\nstreet-door bell ring. He got up, and, without paying attention to\r\nwhat she said, dragged the sheets off of the bed, tore them hurriedly\r\ninto strips, and proceeded to tie the pieces together. She finally\r\nsucceeded in bringing him to himself, when he said he had thought the\r\nhouse was on fire, and he was providing means for their escape. He did\r\nnot recollect having had any dream of the kind, but was under the\r\nimpression that the idea had occurred to him at the instant of his\r\nawaking.\r\n\r\nAnother was suddenly aroused from a sound sleep by the slamming of a\r\nwindow-shutter by the wind. He sprang instantly from his bed, and,\r\nseizing a chair that was near, hurled it with all his strength against\r\nthe window. The noise of the breaking of glass fully awakened him. He\r\nexplained that he imagined some one was trying to get into the room\r\nand had let his pistol fall on the floor, thereby producing the noise\r\nwhich had startled him.\r\n\r\nIn another case a man dreamed that he heard a voice telling him to\r\njump out of the window. He at once arose, threw open the sash, and\r\njumped to the ground below, fortunately only a distance of about ten\r\nfeet, so that he was not injured beyond receiving a violent shock.\r\nSuch a case as this appears to me to be very similar to those\r\ndescribed by Dr. Beard in all its essential aspects.\r\n\r\nA few years ago I had a gentleman under my charge who would attempt to\r\nexecute any order given him while he was asleep by a person\r\nwhispering into his ear. Thus, if told in this way to shout, he\r\nshouted as loud as he could; if ordered to get up, he at once jumped\r\nfrom the bed; if directed to repeat certain words, he said them, and\r\nso on.\r\n\r\nI am not able to give any certain explanation of the phenomena of\r\nmiryachit or of the \"Jumpers,\" or of certain of those cases of\r\nsleep-drunkenness which seem to be of like character. But they all\r\nappear to be due to the fact a motor impulse is excited by perceptions\r\nwithout the necessary concurrence of the volition of the individual to\r\ncause the discharge. They are, therefore, analogous to reflex actions,\r\nand especially to certain epileptic paroxysms due to reflex\r\nirritations. It would seem as though the nerve cells were very much in\r\nthe condition of a package of dynamite or nitro glycerin, in which a\r\nvery slight impression is sufficient to effect a discharge of nerve\r\nforce. They differ, however, from the epileptic paroxysm in the fact\r\nthat the discharge is consonant with the perception--which is in these\r\ncases an irritation--and is hence an apparently logical act, whereas\r\nin epilepsy the discharge is more violent, is illogical, and does not\r\ncease with the cessation of the irritation.\r\n\r\nCertainly the whole subject is of sufficient importance to demand the\r\ncareful study of competent observers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GUM DISEASE IN TREES.[1]\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 1: Communicated to the _Medical Times_ by Sir James Paget.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAn essay by Dr. Beijerinck, on the contagion of the gum disease in\r\nplants, lately published by the Royal Academy of Sciences at\r\nAmsterdam, contains some useful facts. The gum disease (_gummosis,\r\ngum-flux)_ is only too well known to all who grow peaches, apricots,\r\nplums, cherries, or other stone fruits. A similar disease produces gum\r\narabic, gum tragacanth, and probably many resins and gum resins. It\r\nshows itself openly in the exudation of thick and sticky or hard and\r\ndry lumps of gum, which cling on branches of any of these trees where\r\nthey have been cracked or wounded through the bark. Dr. Beijerinck was\r\ninduced to make experimental inoculations of the gum disease by\r\nsuspicions that, like some others observed in plants, it was due to\r\nbacteria. He ascertained that it is in a high degree contagious, and\r\ncan easily be produced by inserting the gum under the edge of a wound\r\nthrough the bark of any of the trees above named. The observation that\r\nheated or long boiled pieces of gum lose their contagious property\r\nmade it most probable that a living organism was concerned in the\r\ncontagions; and he then found that only those pieces of the gum\r\nconveyed contagion in which, whether with or without bacteria, there\r\nwere spores of a relatively highly organized fungus, belonging to the\r\nclass of Ascomycetes; and that these spores, inserted by themselves\r\nunder the bark, produced the same pathological changes as did the\r\npieces of gum. The fungus thus detected, was examined by Professor\r\nOudemans, who ascertained it to be a new species of Coryneum, and has\r\nnamed it _Coryneum Beijerincki_. The inoculation experiments are best\r\nmade by means of incisions through the bark of young branches of\r\nhealthy peach trees or cherry trees, and by slightly raising the cut\r\nedge of the bark and putting under it little bits of gum from a\r\ndiseased tree of the same kind. In nearly every instance these wounds\r\nbecome the seats of acute gum disease, while similar wounds in the\r\nsame or other branches of the same tree, into which no gum is\r\ninserted, remain healthy, unless, by chance, gum be washed into them\r\nduring rain. The inoculation fails only when the inserted pieces of\r\ngum contain no Coryneum. By similar inoculations similar diseases can\r\nbe produced in plum, almond, and apricot trees, and with the gum of\r\nany one of these trees any other can be infected; but of many other\r\nsubstances which Beijerinck tried, not one produced any similar\r\ndisease. The inoculation with the gum is commonly followed by the\r\ndeath of more or less of the adjacent structures; first of the bark,\r\nthen of the wood. Small branches or leaf stalks thus infected in\r\nwinter, or in many places at the same time, may be completely killed;\r\nbut, in the more instructive experiments the first symptom of the gum\r\ndisease is the appearance of a beautiful red color around the wound.\r\nIt comes out in spots like those which often appear spontaneously on\r\nthe green young branches of peach trees that have the gum disease; and\r\nin these spots it is usual to find Coryneum stromata or mycelium\r\nfilaments. The color is due to the formation of a red pigment in one\r\nor more of the layers of the cells of the bark. But in its further\r\nprogress the disease extends beyond the parts at which the Coryneum or\r\nany structures derived from it can be found; and this extension,\r\nBeijerinck believes, is due to the production of a fluid of the nature\r\nof a ferment, produced by the Coryneum, and penetrating the adjacent\r\nstructures. This, acting on the cell walls, the starch granules, and\r\nother constituents of the cells, transforms them into gum, and even\r\nchanges into gum the Coryneum itself, reminding the observer of the\r\nself-digestion of a stomach.\r\n\r\nIn the cells of the cambium, the same fluid penetrating unites with\r\nthe protoplasm, and so alters it that the cells produced from it form,\r\nnot good normal wood, but a morbid parenchymatous structure. The cells\r\nof this parenchyma, well known among the features of gum disease, are\r\ncubical or polyhedral, thin walled, and rich in protoplasm. This, in\r\nits turn, is transformed into gum, such as fills the gum channels and\r\nother cavities found in wood, and sometimes regarded as gum glands.\r\nAnd from this also the new ferment fluid constantly produced, and\r\ntracking along the tissues of the branches, conveys the Coryneum\r\ninfection beyond the places in which its mycelium can be found.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDRINKSTONE PARK.\r\n\r\n\r\nDrinkstone has long been distinguished on account of the successful\r\ncultivation of remarkable plants. It lies some eight miles southeast\r\nfrom Bury St. Edmund's, and is the seat of T.H. Powell, Esq. The\r\nmansion or hall is a large old-fashioned edifice, a large portion of\r\nits south front being covered by a magnificent specimen of the\r\nMagnolia grandiflora, not less than 40 feet in height, while other\r\nportions of its walls are covered with the finest varieties of\r\nclimbing roses and other suitable plants. The surrounding country,\r\nalthough somewhat flat, is well wooded, and the soil is a rich loam\r\nupon a substratum of gravel, and is consequently admirably suited to\r\nthe development of the finer kinds of coniferous and other ornamental\r\ntrees and shrubs, so that the park and grounds contain a fine and well\r\nselected assortment of such plants.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SNOWFLAKE, LEUCOJUM VERNUM, AT DRINKSTONE\r\nPARK.]\r\n\r\nConiferous trees are sometimes considered as out of place in park\r\nscenery; this, however, does not hold good at Drinkstone, where Mr.\r\nPowell has been displayed excellent taste in the way of improving the\r\nlandscape and creating a really charming effect by so skillfully\r\nblending the dressed grounds with the rich greensward of the park\r\nthat it is not easy to tell where the one terminates or the other\r\ncommences.\r\n\r\nThe park, which covers some 200 acres, including a fine lake over\r\neight acres in extent, contains also various large groups or clumps of\r\nsuch species as the Sequoia gigantea, Taxodium sempervirens, Cedres\r\ndeodora, Picea douglasii, Pinsapo, etc., interspersed with groups of\r\nornamental deciduous trees, producing a warm and very pleasing effect\r\nat all seasons of the year. Among species which are conspicuous in the\r\ngrounds are fine, well-grown examples of Araucaria imbricata, some 30\r\nfeet high; Cedrus deodara, 60 feet in height; Abies pinsapo, 40 feet;\r\nand fine specimens of Abies grandis, A. nobilis, and A. nordmanniana,\r\netc., together with Abies albertiana or mertensiana, a fine,\r\nfree-growing species; also Libocedrus gigantea, Thuiopsis borealis,\r\nThuia lobbii, Juniperus recurva, Taxas adpressa, fine plants; with\r\nfine golden yews and equally fine examples of the various kinds of\r\nvariegated hollies, etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ODONTOGLOSSUM ROSSI MAJOR VAR.

JAS. LLOYD, F.C.S., Lecturer on Agriculture, King's\r\nCollege.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe recently published number of the _Royal Agricultural Society's\r\nJournal_ contains some information upon the subject of silage which\r\nappears to me of considerable interest to those chemists who are at\r\npresent investigating the changes which take place in the conversion\r\nof grass into silage. The data[1] are, so far as I know, unique, and\r\nthough the analytical work is not my own, yet it is that of an\r\nagricultural chemist, Mr. A. Smetham, of Liverpool, whose work I know\r\nfrom personal experience to be thoroughly careful and reliable. I have\r\ntherefore no hesitation in basing my remarks upon it.\r\n\r\n   [Footnote 1: _Royal Agricultural Society's Journal_, vol. xx.,\r\n   part i., pp. 175 and 380.]\r\n\r\nWe have here for the first time an accurate account of the quantity of\r\ngrass put into a silo, of the quantity of silage taken out, and of the\r\nexact composition both of the grass and resulting silage. I desire\r\nmerely to place myself in the position of, so to speak, a \"chemical\r\naccountant.\"\r\n\r\nThe ensilage has been analyzed at three depths, or rather in three\r\nlayers, the first being 1 foot, the second 1 ft. to 1 ft. 6 in., and\r\nthe third 1 ft. 6 in. to 2 ft. from the bottom of the silo. By\r\ndoubling the figures of the bottom layer analysis, adding these to the\r\nsecond and third layer analysis, and dividing by 4, we obtain a fair\r\nrepresentation of the average composition of the silage taken\r\nthroughout the silo, for by so doing we obtain the average of the\r\nanalyses of each 6-inch layer of silage. The results of the analyses\r\nare as follows, calculated on the dry matter. The moisture was\r\npractically the same, being 70.48 per cent, in the grass and 72.97 in\r\nthe silage.\r\n\r\n\r\n         _Composition of Grass and Silage (dried at 100°C.)._\r\n\r\n                                         Grass.

I may say, however, that other analysts and I myself have\r\nfound similar striking differences. For instance, Prof. Kinch[2]\r\nfound in grass 8.50 per cent. mineral matter, in silage 10.10 per\r\ncent., which, as be points out, is equivalent, to a \"loss of about 18\r\nper cent. of combustible constituents\"--a loss which we have no proof\r\nof having taken place. In Mr. Smetham's sample the loss would have to\r\nbe 50 per cent., which did not occur, and in fact is not possible.\r\nWhat is the explanation?\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 2: _Journ. Chem. Society_, March, 1884, p. 124.]\r\n\r\nI am, however, considering now the organic constituents. Calculating\r\nthe percentages of these in the grass and silage, we obtain the\r\nfollowing figures:\r\n\r\n          _Percentage Composition of Organic Compounds._\r\n\r\n                                 Grass.

Practically it is a matter of\r\nimpossibility that the nitrogen could have increased in the silo, and\r\nit will be a very safe premise upon which to base any further\r\ncalculations that the total amount of nitrogen in the silage was\r\nidentical with that in the grass. There may have been a loss, but\r\nthat is not yet proved. Arguing then upon the first hypothesis, it is\r\nevident that 100 parts of the organic matters of silage represent more\r\nthan 100 parts of the organic matter of grass, and by the equation we\r\nobtain 10.75:11.43 :: 100:106 approximately. If now we calculate the\r\ncomposition of 106 parts organic matter of grass, it will represent\r\nexactly the organic matter which has gone to form 100 parts of that\r\npresent in silage.\r\n\r\nThe following table gives these results, and also the loss or gain in\r\nthe various constitutents arising from the conversion into silage:\r\n\r\n                 _Organic Matter_.\r\n\r\n                               In 106 pts.

But they show\r\nmost conclusively that the \"decrease in the amount of indigestible\r\nfiber and increase in digestible\" so much spoken of is, so far as our\r\npresent very imperfect methods of analyzing these compounds permit us\r\nto judge, a myth; and I have not yet found any sufficient evidence to\r\nsupport this statement. A loss, then, of 6 parts of organic matter out\r\nof every 106 parts put into the silo has in this instance taken place,\r\ndue chiefly to the decomposition of starch, sugar, and mucilage, etc.\r\nAnd as the grass contained 70 parts of water when put into the silo,\r\nthe total loss would only be 1.7 per cent. of the total weight. This\r\ntheoretical deduction was found by practical experience correct, for\r\nMr. Smith, agent to Lord Egerton, upon whose estate this silage was\r\nmade, in his report to Mr. Jenkins says the \"actual weight out of the\r\nsilo corresponds exactly with the weight we put into the same.\"\r\n\r\nIn my judgment these figures are of interest to the agricultural\r\nchemist for many reasons. First, they will clear the ground for future\r\nworkers and eliminate from their researches what would have greatly\r\ncomplicated them--changes in the cellulose bodies.\r\n\r\nSecondly, they are of interest because our present methods of\r\ndistinguishing between and estimating digestible and indigestible\r\nfiber is most rough, and probably inaccurate, and may not in the least\r\nrepresent the power of an animal--say a cow--to digest these various\r\nsubstances; and most of us know that when a new method of analysis\r\nbecomes a necessity, a new method is generally discovered. Lastly,\r\nthey are of interest to the agriculturist, for they point out, I\r\nbelieve for the first time, the exact amount of loss which grass--or\r\nat least one sample--has undergone in conversion into silage, and also\r\nthat much of the nitrogenous matter is changed, and so far as we know\r\nat present, lost its nutritive value. This, however, is only comparing\r\nsilage with grass. What is wanted is to compare silage with hay--both\r\nmade out of the same grass.

That pure ethylene, when burnt at the rate of 5 cubic\r\nfeet per hour from a Referee's Argand burner, emits a light of 68.5\r\nstandard candles. (2.) That the illuminating power of equal volumes of\r\nmixtures of ethylene with either hydrogen carbonic oxide or\r\nmarsh-gas is less than that of pure ethylene. (3.) That when the\r\nproportion of ethylene in such mixtures is above 63 per cent. the\r\nilluminating power of the mixture is but slightly affected by the\r\nnature of the diluent. When, on the other hand, the proportion of\r\nethylene in such mixtures is low, the illuminating power of the\r\nmixture is considerably the highest when marsh-gas is the diluent, and\r\nthe lowest when the ethylene is mixed with carbonic oxide. (4.) That\r\nif 5 cubic feet of ethylene be uniformly consumed irrespectively of\r\nthe composition of the mixture, the calculated illuminating power is\r\nin every case equal to or actually greater than that of pure ethylene\r\nuntil a certain degree of dilution is attained. This intrinsic\r\nluminosity of ethylene remains almost constant when the latter is\r\ndiluted with carbonic oxide, until the ethylene forms only 40 per\r\ncent. of the mixture, after which it rapidly diminishes to zero when\r\nthe ethylene forms only 20 per cent. of the mixture. When the ethylene\r\nis diluted with hydrogen, its intrinsic luminosity rises to 81 candles\r\nwhen the ethylene constitutes 30 per cent. of the mixture, after which\r\nit rapidly falls to zero when the ethylene amounts to only 10 per\r\ncent. In the case of mixtures of ethylene and marsh-gas, the intrinsic\r\nluminosity of the former is augmented with increasing rapidity as the\r\nproportion of marsh gas rises, the intrinsic luminosity of ethylene,\r\nin a mixture containing 10 per cent. of the latter, being between 170\r\nand 180 candles.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDIFFRACTION PHENOMENA DURING TOTAL SOLAR ECLIPSES.[1]\r\n\r\n   [Footnote 1: A paper read before the American Astronomical\r\n   Society, May 5, 1884.]\r\n\r\nBy G.D. Hiscox.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reality of the sun's corona having been cast in doubt by a leading\r\nobserver of the last total eclipse, who, from the erratic display\r\nobserved in the spectroscope, has declared it a subjective phenomenon\r\nof diffraction, has led me to an examination and inquiry as to the\r\nbearing of an obscurely considered and heretofore only casually\r\nobserved phenomenon seen to take place during total solar eclipses.\r\nThis phenomenon, it seems to me, ought to account for, and will\r\npossibly satisfy, the spectroscopic conditions observed just before,\r\nduring, and after totality; which has probably led to the epithet used\r\nby some leading observers--\"the fickle corona.\" The peculiar\r\nphenomenon observed in the spectroscope, the flickering bands or lines\r\nof the solar spectrum flashing upon and across the coronal spectrum,\r\nhas caused no little speculation among observers.\r\n\r\nThe diffraction or interference bands projected by the passage of a\r\nstrong beam of light by a solid body, as discovered long since by\r\nGrimaldi, and investigated later by Newton, Fresnel, and Fraunhofer,\r\nare explained and illustrated in our text books; but the grand display\r\nof this phenomenon in a total solar eclipse, where the sun is the\r\nsource of light and the moon the intercepting body, has as yet\r\nreceived but little attention from observers, and is not mentioned to\r\nmy knowledge in our text books.\r\n\r\nIn the instructions issued from the United States Naval Observatory\r\nand the Signal Office at Washington for the observation of the eclipse\r\nof July 29, 1878, attention was casually directed to this phenomenon,\r\nand a few of the observers at Pike's Peak, Central City, Denver, and\r\nother places have given lucid and interesting descriptions of the\r\nflight of the diffraction bands as seen coursing over the face of the\r\nearth at the speed of the moon's shadow, at the apparent enormous\r\nvelocity of thirty-three miles per minute, or fifty times the speed of\r\na fast railway train.\r\n\r\nFrom a known optical illusion derived from interference or fits of\r\nperception, as illustrated in quick moving shadows, this great speed\r\nwas not realized to the eye, as the observed motion of these shadows\r\nwas apparently far less rapid than their reality.\r\n\r\nThe ultra or diffraction bands outside of the shadow were distinctly\r\nseen and described by Mr. J.E. Keeler at Central City, both before and\r\nafter totality. He estimates the shadow bands at 8 inches wide and 4\r\nfeet apart.\r\n\r\nProfessor E.S. Holden, also at Central City, estimated the dark bands\r\nas about 3 feet apart, and variable.\r\n\r\nFrom estimates which he obtained from other observers of his party,\r\nthe distances between the bands varied from 6 to l½ feet, but so\r\nquickly did they pass that they baffled all attempts to count even the\r\nnumber that passed in one second.\r\n\r\nHe observed the time of continuance of their passage from west to east\r\nas forty-eight seconds, which indicates a width of 33 miles of\r\ndiffraction bands stretching outward from the edge of the shadow to\r\nthe number of many thousands.\r\n\r\nMr. G.W. Hill, at Denver, a little to the north of the central track\r\nof the shadow, observed the infra or bands within the shadow, alluding\r\nto the fact that they must be moving at the same rate as the shadow,\r\nalthough their apparent motion was much slower, or like the shadows of\r\nflying clouds. He attributes the discrepancy to optical illusion.\r\n\r\nAt Virginia City the _colors_ of the _ultra_ bands were observed, and\r\nestimated at five seconds' duration from the edge of the shadow, which\r\nis equal to about 4 miles in width. These are known to be the\r\nstrongest color bands in the diffraction spectrum, which accounts for\r\ntheir being generally observed.\r\n\r\nMr. W.H. Bush, observing at Central City, in a communication to Prof.\r\nHolden alludes to the brilliancy of the colors of these bands as seen\r\nthrough small clouds floating near the sun's place during totality,\r\nand of the rapid change of their rainbow colors as observed dashing\r\nacross the clouds with the rapidity of thought.\r\n\r\nAll of these bands, both ultra and infra, as seen in optical\r\nexperiments, are colored in reverse order, being from violet to red\r\nfor each band outward and inward from the edge of the shadow.\r\n\r\nIt is very probable that the velocity of the passage of all the bands\r\nduring a total eclipse very much modifies the distinctness of the\r\ncolors or possibly obliterates them by optically blending so as to\r\nproduce the dull white and black bands which occupied so large a\r\nportion of this grand panorama.\r\n\r\nThe phenomenon of these faint colored bands, with the observed light\r\nand dark shadows, may be attributed to one or all of the following\r\ncauses:\r\n\r\n1. A change in the direction of a small portion of the sun's light\r\npassing by the solid body of the moon, it being deflected outward by\r\nrepulsion or reflection from its surface, and other portions being\r\ndeflected inward after passing the body by mutual repulsion of its own\r\nelements toward a _light vacuum_ or space devoid of the element of\r\nvibration.\r\n\r\n2. The colored spectral bands being the direct result of the property\r\nof interference, or the want of correspondence of the wave lengths due\r\nto divergence; the same phenomenon being also observed in convergent\r\nlight. This is practically illustrated in the hazy definition of the\r\nreduced aperture of telescopes, and its peculiarities shown in the\r\nspectral rings within and beyond the focus.\r\n\r\n3. Chromatic dispersion by our atmosphere, together with selective\r\nabsorption, also by our atmosphere and its vapors, have been suggested\r\nas causes in this curious and complicated phenomena.\r\n\r\nIn none of the reports descriptive of the phenomena of polarization of\r\nthe corona is there the slightest allusion to the influence that the\r\ndiffraction bands may possibly have in modifying or producing the\r\nvarious conditions of polarization observed; although these\r\nobservations have been made and commented upon during the past\r\ntwenty-five years.\r\n\r\nInvestigations now in progress of the modifying relation of the\r\nphenomenon of diffraction in its effect upon not only the physical\r\naspect of the corona, but also in some strange spectroscopic anomalies\r\nthat have been observed near the sun at other times than during a\r\ntotal solar eclipse, will, it is hoped, result in a fuller\r\ninterpretation of the physical nature of one of the grandest elements\r\nof creation--_light_; let there be more of it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nA CATALOGUE containing brief notices of many important scientific\r\npapers heretofore published in the SUPPLEMENT, may be had gratis at\r\nthis office.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Scientific American Supplement.\r\n\r\nPUBLISHED WEEKLY.\r\n\r\nTerms of Subscription, $5 a Year.\r\n\r\nSent by mail, postage prepaid, to subscribers in any part of the\r\nUnited States or Canada.
