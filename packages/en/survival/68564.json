D.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Cape Cod to Cape Florida our coast is fringed with barrier\r\nbeaches. They are the reefs of sand which protect the mainland shore\r\nfrom the storm-waves of the ocean. Isolated and uninhabited were\r\nmost of these sea-born barriers for a long period in the history of\r\nour country, but the need of a breathing-place on the part of the\r\nthousands who inhabit our crowded cities has caused, within a few\r\nyears, a great transformation. Railroad and turnpike bridges have been\r\nbuilt, connecting many of them with the shore. Hotels and cottages,\r\nclub-houses and bathing-houses, in short, buildings for every purpose\r\nwhich contributes to the pleasure and comfort of man have sprung up, as\r\nit were by magic, on the south shore of Long Island, on the coast of\r\nNew Jersey, Virginia, and the Carolinas, on the famed sea-islands of\r\nGeorgia, and on the coast of eastern Florida.\r\n\r\nMuch alike are these peninsulas and islands wherever we view them along\r\nthe coast. The chief variation is in the vegetation which clothes them.\r\nThe beaches of Long Island are almost barren, but from New Jersey\r\nsouthward many are covered with dense forests which vary in their\r\ntrees according to the latitude. At Sandy Hook, oaks, red cedars,\r\nhollies, maples, and sassafras-trees grow in wonderful luxuriance. On\r\nSeven-Mile Beach and Holly Beach the swamp magnolia abounds among the\r\nothers. In the Carolinas the palmetto appears, often ragged in outline\r\nand blighted by the winter frosts. In northern Florida the palmettos\r\nare more numerous and show the influence of a warmer climate, while\r\non the southern extremity of the zone of barrier beaches the cocoanut\r\npalm, planted by accident or design, rears its leafy crown in luxuriant\r\nverdure.\r\n\r\nIt is not the design of the writer to describe in detail the beaches of\r\nthe Atlantic coast, but rather to consider their history and mode of\r\ngrowth. As it has been his fortune to spend much time on the sea-shore\r\nof New Jersey, he proposes to discuss the barrier beaches of that State\r\nas types of their genus.\r\n\r\nThey are sandy islands and peninsulas, from two to twenty miles in\r\nlength and from half a mile to a mile in width, separated by inlets\r\nand usually divided from the mainland by an interval of several miles,\r\nin which are broad expanses of salt meadow, fringing and separating a\r\nseries of channels, bays, and sounds.\r\n\r\nThe beaches which are now in their highest state of development are\r\nSandy Hook, Seven-Mile Beach, and Holly Beach near Cape May. These\r\ntypical examples of the sea-born barriers are much alike in structure,\r\nand consist of four principal divisions. The first division, or\r\ninterior, is an undulating area covered with heavy timber, of which\r\nthe size suggests its age. Immense hollies, oaks, pines, and red\r\ncedars abound, many of the first measuring two feet in diameter, and\r\nsome of the latter attaining a circumference of four or five yards.\r\nThe sassafras grows in remarkable luxuriance and immense grape-vines\r\nare everywhere to be seen, overhanging a dense undergrowth. In spring\r\nand summer the ground is covered with fragrant blossoms; columbines,\r\nviolets, pinks, orchids, and a host of other flowers lend their blight\r\ncolors to enhance the varied greens of the foliage. This is the beach\r\nprimeval. Skirting it seaward is the second division, which bears\r\nsmaller timber. Low cedars, hollies, and pines are here the chief forms\r\nof arboreal vegetation, and fewer flowering plants are seen. This zone\r\nis of later formation, and its trees are younger than those of the\r\nfirst. Adjoining it is the third division, which consists of a belt of\r\nundulating dunes a few hundred feet or yards in width, and bearing\r\nthe mossy Hudsonia or scrubby bushes of beach plum and wax-myrtle, or\r\nin some places, especially on the outer row of dunes, only supporting\r\na meager growth of beach grass. Frequently, between two rows of dunes,\r\nan expanse of salt meadow occurs, or a sand flat bearing stunted forms\r\nof plant life. With this third division ends the domain of vegetation,\r\nsucceeded by the sloping strand upon which the tide rises and falls.\r\nThe sand-bar, exposed at low water at the extremity of the beach,\r\nis constantly increased in length and height by the action of the\r\ncurrents, and the process of beach formation is here continually in\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nAs the tide falls, the sand laid bare is rapidly dried by the wind\r\nand carried above high-water mark. Then, safe beyond the reach of\r\nthe waves, the minute particles are borne still farther from the\r\nwater, and striking against some piece of drift-wood, bush, or tuft\r\nof grass, quickly build a hillock, which grows larger and larger as\r\nmore sand falls upon it, and a dune is formed many feet in height.\r\nThe material of which these dunes are composed is never at rest, but\r\nflies hither and thither with the wind, and a hillock ten or fifteen\r\nfeet high to-day may noiselessly be taken down to-morrow and rebuilt a\r\nhundred yards away. In time, as the beach grows seaward and the dunes\r\nincrease in number, those of earlier formation, which are somewhat\r\nprotected from the breeze, catch a few seeds, and tufts of grass begin\r\nto grow upon them. Still later, the mossy Hudsonia or some starveling\r\nwax-myrtle finds a little sustenance, and as years elapse the dunes\r\nbecome so thickly covered with vegetation that under the protection of\r\nthe seaward hillocks they retain their form with comparatively little\r\nchange.\r\n\r\nThus have the beaches grown. First a sand flat built by ocean waves\r\nand currents; then a series of low, shifting dunes; next sheltered\r\nhillocks, on which grasses and shrubs fasten their protecting roots;\r\nsucceeding the latter a growth of small cedars and pines; and, finally,\r\nas centuries roll on, majestic forest trees raise their spreading tops\r\nand shelter a dense undergrowth.\r\n\r\nThese few words suffice to describe the beaches’ growth, their\r\nphysiology; but many pages might be written upon their history,\r\nthe details of their development, their changes and their decay.\r\nUnfortunately, the records are but incomplete. From the memories of\r\nold men we can glean some facts in regard to the former condition and\r\nextent of certain beaches and concerning marked changes in them which\r\nhave been notable events to men of quiet lives. In a few instances,\r\nsurveys were made a century or two ago which can be compared with those\r\nof to-day. At present we can watch the changes which occur from year to\r\nyear. As geological science advances we can speculate concerning the\r\npast on the basis of present knowledge and observation. We have little\r\naccurate information, but, after all, we have much that is interesting.\r\n\r\nThe beach of Sandy Hook forms the northern extremity of the New Jersey\r\nsea-coast. Previous to 1778 it was connected with the base of the\r\nNavesink Highlands by a sandy isthmus, the mouths of the Navesink and\r\nShrewsbury Rivers being open to the east; but from that date until\r\nabout 1830, and from 1848 until 1889, it has been united with the\r\nmainland at Monmouth Beach by a narrow strip of sand.\r\n\r\nAccording to records in the office of the Surveyor-General of East\r\nJersey and in that of the United States Coast Survey, the point of\r\nSandy Hook advanced northward about one mile between 1685 and 1885. The\r\nlighthouse was built about 1764 near the water’s edge, and the ground\r\non which it stands had then existed for only fifteen years as a portion\r\nof _terra firma_.\r\n\r\nIn 1844 the point was about two hundred and fifty yards north of\r\nits present limit. Since that date it has receded slowly toward the\r\nsouth, and toward the west has extended a quarter of a mile. We have\r\nno evidence concerning the date of formation of the old “Hook” which\r\nexisted before 1685. It is now well marked by immense forest trees,\r\nwhich exceed in height and size of trunk any of their species known to\r\nthe writer in the neighborhood of New York.\r\n\r\nThe rapid growth of Sandy Hook is due to a current which flows\r\nnorthward from the vicinity of Manasquan, carrying with it a great\r\nquantity of sand removed from the water-front of Asbury Park, Long\r\nBranch, Seabright, and that vicinity, which is dropped along the border\r\nof the “Hook” and its extremity. The investigations of the United\r\nStates Coast and Geodetic Survey have shown that the ebb and flow of\r\nthe tides from and to New York Bay produce this current by drawing a\r\nstream of water through False Hook Channel, which lies between Sandy\r\nHook and a submerged bar called False Hook half a mile to the east.\r\nThe stream flows northward more than seven hours out of twelve, and\r\nfrom this fact property-owners in the neighborhood of Long Branch may\r\nappreciate what becomes of their real estate when it disappears during\r\nthe storms. If there were any means of identifying the soil, it might\r\nall be found on the rapidly growing point of Sandy Hook.\r\n\r\nAbout 1778 a channel was opened across the narrow isthmus which\r\nunited Sandy Hook with the base of the Navesink Highlands, and a new\r\npassage being thus afforded for the tidal currents of the Navesink and\r\nShrewsbury Rivers, the old Shrewsbury Inlet, which formed the common\r\nmouth of those two estuaries, was gradually closed by the northward\r\nextension of the sand-spit which formed the southern limit, and in\r\n1810 became impassable. The barrier thus formed existed until 1830 or\r\n1831, when it was broken through and a second inlet was created. By a\r\nchange in the tidal currents, due to the formation of this new inlet,\r\nthe isthmus which formerly connected Sandy Hook with the Highlands of\r\nNavesink was again brought into existence and remained until 1835. An\r\nartificial channel was then cut through it, and this being gradually\r\ndeepened and widened by the ebb and flow of the tides, has ever since\r\nremained open. The second Shrewsbury inlet closed in 1840 near Island\r\nBeach, having moved northward nearly three miles during its existence\r\nof nine or ten years. In 1837 or 1838 the third and last inlet opened\r\nnear the present Bellevue Hotel, and afforded a better channel for\r\nnavigation than the second inlet, which it followed in its northward\r\ncourse and survived by about eight years. From 1848 until September,\r\n1889, no inlet has been opened; but this fact is due rather to the\r\nefforts of the railroad company to maintain its road-bed than to a\r\ndiminution of the tendency of the waves and tidal currents to open a\r\npassage.\r\n\r\nThe facts and dates concerning the Shrewsbury Inlets have been obtained\r\nchiefly by inquiry from old fishermen and sailors who have spent\r\ntheir lives on or near the waters of the Navesink and Shrewsbury\r\nRivers. Coming from a number of independent sources, they agree very\r\nclosely, and those here given may be accepted as worthy of credence.\r\nThe tendency of the inlets to work northward, periodically closing and\r\nreopening farther south, has been observed in all those between Point\r\nPleasant and Sandy Hook, especially in those of Manasquan and Shark\r\nRivers. Between Point Pleasant and Cape May, however, all the inlets\r\nare moving southward.\r\n\r\nFrom Monmouth to the head of Barnegat Bay there is no beach similar to\r\nthat of Sandy Hook. Instead of a sand-reef separated from the mainland\r\nby a navigable channel, there is only the sloping strand adjoining,\r\nas at Long Branch, the foot of an upland bluff, or as at Spring Lake,\r\nSeagirt, and Point Pleasant, with its crest on a level with the surface\r\nof the upland. Between Bay Head and Cape May, however, there are twelve\r\nbeaches, mostly well developed and preserved, and named respectively\r\nSquan, Island, Long, Island or Little, Brigantine, Absecon, Peck’s,\r\nLudlam’s, Seven-Mile, Five-Mile or Holly, Two-Mile, and Poverty. The\r\nmajority of these, however, do not show the high degree of development\r\nexhibited by Seven-Mile and Five-Mile Beaches. Some appear to be only\r\nin the earlier stages of growth, while others have passed their prime\r\nand are now yielding to the attacks of wind and wave.\r\n\r\nThese agents have been hitherto considered only with reference to\r\ntheir constructive effect on the beaches, and it now remains to\r\nconsider their destructive action.\r\n\r\nWhen the wind blows from the west it carries back to the sea much of\r\nthe sand which the east wind had piled up in dunes, and, but for the\r\nfact that the latter wind prevails, the sand-hills would not long\r\nexist. By a surplus of constructive action, however, the beaches are\r\nall moving to the west. Year after year sand is removed from their\r\neastern margin by the winter storms, and carried north or south\r\naccording to the direction of the prevailing current. The winds from\r\nthe ocean drive the dunes westward, and, with the possible exception of\r\nSandy Hook, all the beaches are now underlaid by an old salt meadow,\r\noriginally formed in sheltered waters on their west side. In this turf,\r\nwhen exposed during an unusually low tide, the footprints of cattle\r\nare seen in many places, made, it is claimed, when the salt meadow was\r\na pasture and lay on the shoreward side of the beach. This westward\r\nrecession has, in many cases, amounted to more than a mile within two\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\nOn many of the beaches south of Point Pleasant the westward progress of\r\nthe dunes has been made over and through the native forest. As a result\r\nof this, gnarled cedars, dying and dead, are found among the dunes; and\r\nin many cases stumps may be seen in the sand within reach of the tide.\r\n\r\nNear the northern end of Seven-Mile Beach, at the time of the writer’s\r\nvisit in 1885, an immense dune forty feet in height and half a mile\r\nin length had been for many years encroaching steadily upon the dense\r\nforest. The tree-tops here projected above the summit of the ridge\r\nlike the heads of drowning men above the waves; while on the outer\r\nflank of the overwhelming mass of sand the gnarled, skeleton trunks\r\nof those which had perished in it stood bare and grim, showing with\r\ndreary grayness the fate of the earlier victims of which the ragged and\r\nwave-worn stumps alone remained. A more desolate scene the writer has\r\nnever witnessed.\r\n\r\nAt Long Branch the wear of the coast has been very great. According to\r\nthe United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, a strip of land varying\r\nfrom three hundred to five hundred feet in width was removed between\r\nDeal Beach and Monmouth during the twenty-seven years preceding 1868.\r\nIn the vicinity of Seabright the amount of wear was a little less\r\nthan two hundred feet during that period. Of late years the rate of\r\nrecession has been diminished in the neighborhood of Long Branch by\r\nthe means of artificial protection employed, but near Seabright the\r\nshore line is said to have receded at least two hundred feet during the\r\npast quarter of a century. At Cape May the wear of the shore has been\r\ncontinuous except where the land is protected by jetties or a stone\r\nsea-wall, the rate of encroachment varying from ten to thirty feet a\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nBesides these alterations produced in the beaches by their westward\r\nprogress, the variations in the positions of the inlets and the\r\nsubsidence of the coast have caused many important changes. The history\r\nof the Shrewsbury Inlets has already been given; it remains to mention\r\na few of those south of Point Pleasant.\r\n\r\nSquan and Island Beaches, which now form a peninsula about twenty miles\r\nlong, terminating at Barnegat Inlet, were separated from 1750 to 1812\r\nby Cranberry Inlet, which was nearly opposite the mouth of Tom’s River.\r\nSince 1812 near the site of this old inlet there have been others of\r\nbrief duration, and one is said to have existed before 1755 opposite\r\nthe mouth of the Metedeconk River, which separated Squan Beach from the\r\nmainland.\r\n\r\nThe old Barnegat Lighthouse is said to have stood nearly six hundred\r\nyards north of the present south shore of the inlet, at a point now\r\noccupied by the center of the channel. In 1855 the old tower was at\r\nthe water’s edge, so that the inlet has moved southward approximately\r\ntwenty yards per year.\r\n\r\nAbsecon Inlet, which separates Brigantine Beach from Absecon Beach, has\r\nencroached upon the latter about four hundred yards in twenty years;\r\nand the ocean front of that portion of Absecon Beach which is occupied\r\nby Atlantic City extended in 1855 nearly half a mile farther east than\r\nit did in 1885. About 1875 jetties were built which arrested the action\r\nof the tidal currents, and, the wear of the shore being thus prevented,\r\na considerable area was restored.\r\n\r\nSubmerged tree-stumps and other evidences of a subsidence of the coast\r\nmay be found on the beaches and the salt meadows, but a detailed\r\nenumeration of them would be beyond the scope of the present article.\r\n\r\nIn Cape May County the depression has not been less than twenty feet,\r\nand has possibly been much greater. The evidence of some old buildings\r\non the shore of Delaware Bay suggests a subsidence of about four feet\r\nduring the last two centuries.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful whether depression _alone_ has caused the wear of\r\nthe coast. A comparison of the present outline of Holly Beach with\r\nthat determined by a survey in 1772 shows an accretion on the south\r\nand east, since the latter date, more than three and a half miles\r\nlong and averaging three eighths of a mile in width, and on many\r\nother beaches a similar growth has taken place. During the past five\r\nyears the ocean has rapidly encroached upon these beaches, while the\r\nsubsidence of the coast, so far as we know, has been uniform throughout\r\nthe past two centuries. It would appear, therefore, that the growth\r\nand decay of the beaches are more dependent upon the action of the\r\nocean currents and winds than upon other agencies. Unquestionably the\r\ndepression of the coast renders the beaches more subject to overflow\r\nand erosion by the waves and currents; but the evidence at many points\r\nshows that the latter are capable of forming large areas of beach\r\nwhere the conditions of their existence and action favor construction\r\nrather than destruction. While these currents act as at present, the\r\ncost of preventing the ravages of the sea, by the methods commonly\r\nin use, would probably be much greater than the value of the land\r\nprotected, for the fine sand is so unstable when wet that bulkheads and\r\nbreakwaters are quite ephemeral.\r\n\r\nAfter an extended examination of the various systems of shore defense\r\nin use between Sandy Hook and Cape May, it appears to the writer that\r\nthe only effectual means of protection is the construction of jetties\r\nextending far enough from the shore to intercept the currents which\r\ncarry away the sand loosened by the waves. Such jetties have added a\r\nlarge area to the territory of Atlantic City, and have protected the\r\nshore at Cape May; no doubt they would be effective everywhere if\r\nproperly constructed.\r\n\r\nThe experience of the past ten years on the New Jersey coast shows\r\nconclusively that the ocean front is not fit for building purposes, for\r\nit is impossible to protect a house near the water’s edge from injury\r\nor destruction in the heaviest storms. The height and force of the\r\nwaves in such a tempest as that of September 10 and 11, 1889, render\r\nthem irresistible to any body or structure which nature or art has yet\r\nproduced, and anything within their reach must suffer. The immediate\r\nwater-front is only available for parks; and, if devoted to this use,\r\nwhen protected from the erosive action of the currents by suitable\r\njetties, would remain a neutral ground which, in fair weather, would\r\nafford numberless attractions to the occupants of dwellings placed far\r\nenough from the strand to be out of reach of the storm-waves.\r\n\r\nProperty-owners along the ocean front of the beaches have generally\r\nmade the mistake of supposing that the domain of the Atlantic was\r\nbounded by the high-water mark of the spring tides. Any one who\r\nshould build a dwelling on the strand below ordinary high-water mark\r\nwould be considered lacking in common sense, yet it is scarcely less\r\nfoolish to build within reach of the storm-waves. It is, of course,\r\ntrue that many cottages are now much nearer the water’s edge than\r\nthey were a few years ago. This is due to the wear of the shore by\r\ncurrents already described as flowing parallel to it and removing the\r\nsand which the waves have loosened. If the action of these currents\r\nshould be stopped--and there is good evidence to show that a system\r\nof jetties would intercept them and cause them to drop their stolen\r\nload of sand--the wear of the shore would be arrested and the yearly\r\nencroachments of the ocean would cease.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the inundation of Atlantic City by the sea in the\r\ngreat September storm of 1889 it should be said that this catastrophe\r\nought not to be considered very wonderful, since the greater portion\r\nof the city is less than ten feet above mean tide, and the highest\r\npoint recorded by the New Jersey State Survey is only thirteen feet\r\nabove that level. As ordinary tides rise a foot above this plane, and\r\nspring tides nearly two feet, it is evident that a prolonged easterly\r\nstorm would soon cause a considerable area to be overflowed. Since the\r\nbays and channels which lie between the beach and the mainland are\r\nalmost completely landlocked and the inlets are relatively narrow, the\r\nwater-level is soon raised to a height of two or three feet above the\r\nmeadows, and this is sufficient to cover most of the railroad tracks.\r\nTo be sure, no such inundation as the recent one has occurred since\r\nAtlantic City became a place of importance, nor do the old residents\r\non the coast remember such a storm in former years; but it is evident\r\nthat, while the beaches were uninhabited, such a storm as the one in\r\nquestion would attract less attention, since it would cause little if\r\nany loss of property.\r\n\r\nThe genesis of the beaches is still a matter for speculation, but\r\nit may be safely affirmed that they originated as sand-bars, formed\r\nunder water by wave and current action. How these bars were brought\r\nabove water, so that the wind could exert its constructive power, is\r\nuncertain. A plausible hypothesis is, that while the ocean was breaking\r\non the mainland shore and forming the Quaternary terraces, which may be\r\nseen there, sand-bars were made under water, and that the continental\r\nelevation which raised these terraces to their present position\r\nfrom twenty-five to eighty feet above tide, brought these sand-bars\r\nabove water into a horizon of Æolian action. Once above the sea, the\r\nbeaches would maintain their existence. A continued elevation of the\r\ncoast would add to their seaward extent and a depression would cause\r\na westward recession until they were brought to rest by contact with\r\nthe mainland shore. In New Jersey the latter condition may be observed\r\nbetween Long Branch and Point Pleasant and also at Cape May.\r\n\r\nSo far as it is known to the writer, the only way in which a beach can\r\nbe entirely destroyed is by an inlet shifting its position. In this\r\ncase the beach obliterated is replaced by the extension of an adjacent\r\nbeach.\r\n\r\nOf the beaches south of New Jersey not enough is known to the writer\r\nto permit of a detailed biographical sketch. Their form and structure\r\nshow that they have been subject to the same formative agencies and\r\nvicissitudes as those already described. In addition to the Georgia\r\nsea-islands of _ante-bellum_ fame, may be mentioned as familiar\r\nexamples the barriers which in Virginia and North Carolina separate\r\nAlbemarle and Pamlico Sounds from the ocean; in Florida, Amelia Island\r\non which is built the city of Fernandina; Anastasia Island, in front\r\nof St. Augustine; and the beaches which separate Halifax and Indian\r\nRivers from the Atlantic. The last named rivers are the lagoons which\r\nseparate the barriers from the mainland shore. Lake Worth is one of\r\nthese lagoons, of which the inlet has been closed.\r\n\r\nTo what extent the Florida Keys may be included in the category of\r\nbarrier beaches must be decided by future investigation. Key West\r\nis evidently a wave-built sand-bar composed of fragments of coral,\r\nmolluscan shells, and foraminifera, and it seems likely that Cayo Largo\r\nand others of that type may be of similar origin. The coquina deposits\r\nof the vicinity of St. Augustine are also wave-formed.\r\n\r\nThe hypothesis of Prof. Louis Agassiz, that the Florida Keys are all\r\nof organic origin--i. e., that they were formed by the growth of coral\r\nreefs--may be true so far as the determination of their location and\r\ndirection. A submerged reef of coral may have formed a nucleus on\r\nwhich the waves and currents deposited a load of calcareous sand, but\r\nthe superficial portion is evidently similar in origin to that of the\r\nbeaches farther north.\r\n\r\nBarrier beaches are found on all the sea-coasts of the world where\r\nopportunity for their growth has been afforded, and those of New Jersey\r\nmay be regarded as types of these formations in all their essential\r\nfeatures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSCRIBER’S NOTES:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Italicized text is surrounded by underscores: _italics_.\r\n\r\n  Inconsistencies in hyphenation have been standardized.\r\n\r\n  Archaic or variant spelling has been retained.\r\n\r\n  The cover image for this eBook was created by the transcriber and is\r\n    entered into the public domain.",
