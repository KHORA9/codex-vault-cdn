Our native\r\nfruits in particular are now receiving, in many parts of the country, a\r\nlarger share of the attention which they have always merited, and none\r\nhas proven itself more worthy of careful study and painstaking care than\r\nthe pecan.\r\n\r\nWithin the last ten or fifteen years it has rapidly emerged from a wild\r\nor semi-wild condition to the status of an orchard nut. The foundations\r\nof its culture were laid a considerable time ago, but only now is it\r\ncoming to its own, its well merited standing among the fruits of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nIn any horticultural industry many questions must be asked of the plant,\r\nthe soil, the climate, in short, of the plant in its environment. They\r\nmust be answered aright, if the industry is to succeed. The newer the\r\nplant in cultivation, the more numerous the questions are, the more\r\ndifficult to answer.\r\n\r\nIn an endeavor to aid in solving some of the problems connected with the\r\nculture of the pecan this small volume has been prepared. Pecan culture\r\nhas been the subject of careful study, observation and experimentation\r\non the part of the author for a number of years and the results of these\r\nstudies are presented in the following pages.\r\n\r\nTo the many who have so kindly and willingly assisted in its\r\npreparation, my thanks are herein expressed.\r\n\r\n                               H.

Botany.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PECAN AND ITS CULTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL AND ORNAMENTAL IMPORTANCE OF THE PECAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn all-around excellence, the pecan is equalled by none of the native\r\nAmerican nut-bearing trees and certainly it is surpassed by no exotic\r\nspecies. It stands in the list of nut trees with but few equals and no\r\nsuperiors. With this fact known and admitted by all, it seems reasonable\r\nto suppose that the pecan will be grown and cultivated much more\r\nextensively than it now is. Its intrinsic worth deserves a large share\r\nof attention, more than it has received. At present it is gaining a\r\nposition of so much importance as an orchard tree, that, ere long, it\r\nwill become an extremely important item in the horticultural wealth of\r\nthe Southern and Southwestern States.\r\n\r\nLarge quantities of pecans are sold in the American markets. These are\r\nthe product of uncultivated or forest trees. Many orchards of\r\nconsiderable size, planted with meritorious budded and grafted\r\nvarieties, are now in bearing, but the product of these plantings is\r\nentirely used by what may be termed a private trade, either by seedsmen,\r\nor by private individuals for dessert purposes. Some day, varieties of\r\npecans will become known in the markets just as varieties of grapes,\r\napples or pears are known. People ask for Niagara or Concord grapes,\r\nNorthern Spy or Greening apples, Bartlet or Seckel pears--ask for what\r\nthey want, and know what they are getting. The day is far distant when\r\nFrotscher, Schley, San Saba, Curtis, Georgia or other varieties of\r\npecans will be known by name by the purchasing public, asked for in the\r\nmarkets and recognized when procured. But that time must and will come,\r\nand until then there is no danger of the industry being overdone, and\r\nnot even then, because our population is constantly growing; because the\r\npecan nut is being put to a variety of new uses, and as yet the export\r\ntrade is comparatively undeveloped. (See table, page 15.) It would seem\r\nthen that the pecan might reasonably be expected to replace to a certain\r\nextent the foreign nuts in our own markets.\r\n\r\nAccording to the investigations of Woods and Merrill,[A] the pecan has a\r\nhigher food value than either the walnut, filbert, cocoanut, almond or\r\npeanut. The results of their analyses are as follows:\r\n\r\n-------------------+---------+---------------------------------------+--------\r\n                   |         |    EDIBLE PORTION.                    |\r\n                   |         +------+--------+------+---------+------+--------\r\n                   | Edible  |      |        |      |Carbo-   |      |Fuel\r\n                   | Portion.|Water.|Protein.|Fat.  |hydrates.| Ash. |Value\r\n                   |         |      |        |      |         |      |per\r\n                   |         |      |        |      |         |      |Pound.[A]\r\n-------------------+---------+------+--------+------+---------+------+--------\r\n                   |per cent.|pr ct.| pr ct. |pr ct.| pr ct.  |pr ct.|Calories\r\nPecans, kernels    | 100.0   | 2.9  |  10.3  | 70.8 |  14.3   | 1.7  | 3445\r\nWalnuts, kernels   | 100.0   | 2.8  |  16.7  | 61.4 |  14.8   | 1.3  | 3305\r\nFilberts, kernels  | 100.0   | 3.7  |  15.6  | 65.3 |  13.0   | 2.4  | 3290\r\nCocoanuts, shred'd |         | 3.5  |   6.3  | 57.3 |  31.6   | 1.3  | 3125\r\nAlmonds, kernels   | 100.0   | 4.8  |  21.0  | 54.9 |  17.3   | 2.0  | 3030\r\nShelled Peanuts    | 100.0   | 1.6  |  30.5  | 49.2 |  16.2   | 2.5  | 2955\r\n-------------------+---------+------+--------+------+---------+------+--------\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE II. An Avenue Shaded by Pecan Trees.]\r\n\r\nIt is a fact worthy of note that the average man requires 3,500 calories\r\nof energy each day, an amount which must be secured from food consumed.\r\nOne pound of pecan kernels, according to the above analysis, would\r\nsupply 3,445 calories, or only 55 calories less than the amount required\r\nper day. We are not, be it understood, pointing out this fact because we\r\nbelieve that the pecan alone would be a satisfactory food, though it is\r\nwholesome, nourishing and palatable and should be used in larger\r\nquantities than is usually the case, but simply to emphasize its high\r\nfood value.\r\n\r\nAccording to the foregoing analysis, the pecan is richer in fat than any\r\nof the other nuts. Seventy per cent. of the kernels is fat. The pecan\r\nmay at some time be in requisition as a source of oil--an oil which\r\nwould doubtless be useful for salad purposes--but it is never likely to\r\nbe converted into oil until the present prices of the nuts are greatly\r\nreduced.\r\n\r\nIf we turn from the dietary value of the nut to the ornamental value of\r\nthe tree, we cannot but be forcibly impressed with its value as a shade\r\nand ornamental tree. For these purposes it may be planted far outside\r\nthe area in which fruit may be reasonably expected. If given good soil\r\nand sufficient food supply, it grows quite rapidly, making a stately,\r\nvigorous, long-lived tree. In its native forests it is a giant tree,\r\nsometimes reaching a height of upwards of two hundred feet with a trunk\r\nof six feet. Isolated specimens, grown in the open, come to maturity\r\nwith wide-spreading branches and the whole tree has an exceedingly\r\ngraceful appearance. Wherever it will succeed, no other shade tree is so\r\nworthy of attention as the pecan, and in the fruiting area, beauty and\r\nhealthful shade may be combined with utility.\r\n\r\nAs an orchard tree it is well worth planting. The ground in which the\r\ntrees are planted may be cultivated in other crops for a number of\r\nyears, thus reducing to a minimum the cost of maintaining the planting,\r\nand when the trees have come into bearing, the same area in trees will\r\nyield more in net returns than the same area in cotton or corn at the\r\nusual market prices.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, considered from whatever standpoint we may choose, the\r\npecan is a valuable tree, whether cultivated for its nuts or planted for\r\nshade or ornamental effect.\r\n\r\nExports of Nuts from United States for Years 1900-1904 inclusive.\r\n\r\n+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+\r\n| 1900     | 1901     | 1902     | 1903     | 1904     |\r\n+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+\r\n| VALUE.   | VALUE.   | VALUE.   | VALUE.   | VALUE.   |\r\n+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+\r\n| $156,490 | $218,743 | $304,241 | $299,558 | $330,366 |\r\n+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+\r\n\r\nImportations of Nuts into the United States for the Years 1899 to 1904\r\ninclusive, according to the most authoritative statistics.[B]\r\n\r\n+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n|                  1899                  1900                  1901         |\r\n+----------+---------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+\r\n|VARIETY   |Quant'y  |Value.    |Quant'y   | Value.   |Quant'y   | Value.   |\r\n|OF NUTS.  |lbs.     |          |lbs.      |          |lbs.      |          |\r\n+----------+---------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+\r\n|Almonds   |9,957,427|$1,222,587| 6,317,633|  $949,083| 5,140,232|  $946,138|\r\n|Cocoanuts.|         |   625,789|          |   702,947|          |   804,233|\r\n|Walnuts   |   (a)   |    (a)   |   (a)    |    (a)   |   (a)    |    (a)   |\r\n|Other     |         |   879,166|          | 1,326,804|          | 1,518,184|\r\n+----------+---------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+\r\n|Total Nuts|         |$2,727,542|          |$2,978,834|          |$3,268,255|\r\n+----------+---------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+\r\n|                  1902                  1903                  1904         |\r\n+----------+---------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+\r\n|VARIETY   |Quant'y  |Value.    |Quant'y   | Value.   |Quant'y   | Value.   |\r\n|OF NUTS.  |lbs.     |          |lbs.      |          |lbs.      |          |\r\n+----------+---------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+\r\n|Almonds   |9,868,982|$1,240,886| 8,142,164|$1,337,717| 9,838,852|$1,246,474|\r\n|Cocoanuts.|         |   832,383|          |   908,242|          |   971,852|\r\n|Walnuts   |   (a)   |    (a)   |12,362,567| 1,106,033|23,670,761| 1,729,378|\r\n|Other     |         | 1,971,072|          | 1,514,406|          | 1,523,462|\r\n+----------+---------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+\r\n|Total Nuts|         |$4,044,341|          |$4,866,398|          |$5,471,166|\r\n+----------+---------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[A] Calculated from analysis.\r\n\r\n[B] Yearbook U.S. Dept. of Agr., 1903, page 686, and 1904, page 728.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nNATIVE AND CULTIVATED RANGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe pecan is found as a forest tree in the moist bottom lands along the\r\nMississippi river and its tributaries, from Indiana southward to\r\nMississippi, and from Iowa to Texas and Mexico.\r\n\r\nThis region (see Fig. 1) in which the pecan is, or has been found,\r\nnative, reaches its northern limit at Davenport, Iowa. It skirts the\r\nWabash as far north as Terre Haute, Indiana, and along the Ohio river\r\nnearly to Cincinnati, Ohio. From thence its range extends south to\r\nChattanooga, Tenn., and on to Vicksburg, Miss. From Vicksburg it skirts\r\nthe Gulf of Mexico at a distance of seventy-five to one hundred miles to\r\nLaredo, Texas; thence along the Salado river into Mexico. The western\r\nboundary embraces the headwaters of the Colorado river and returns more\r\nor less directly to Davenport, Iowa. On the outskirts of this area, it\r\nextends farthest in all directions along the streams and rivers, while\r\non the drier intervening ground the line does not extend so far from the\r\ncenter of the region. Particularly is this true in Southwestern Texas,\r\nwhere the pecan is confined almost solely to river bottoms.\r\n\r\n\r\nCULTURAL AREA.\r\n\r\nThe area in which the pecan is cultivated as an orchard tree is not\r\nconfined to the limits of its native range. Plantings have been made\r\noutside its native home in New Mexico, California and Oregon in the\r\nWest, and in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida,\r\nSouthern Alabama and the Gulf regions of Louisiana, Mississippi and\r\nTexas. In many other States experimental plantings have been made.\r\nLeaving these out of consideration, however, it will be seen that in\r\nabout twenty States the pecan is either found as a native tree in the\r\nforests or is cultivated in orchard form. The area corresponds in some\r\nmeasure with that in which cotton is grown, though it extends farther\r\nnorth and west than the cotton region.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1. Approximate Pecan areas. Native areas within\r\nsolid line. Cultural area within dotted line.]\r\n\r\nThe attempts which have been made from time to time to cultivate the\r\npecan in the more northerly States have not proved successful. The tree\r\nhas, in many cases, grown well, but fruit has not been produced. The\r\npistils and stamens of the pecan are not found in the same flower but in\r\ndifferent flowers borne some distance apart on new and one-year-old\r\nwood, respectively. Consequently, it frequently happens that the flowers\r\nare not matured at the same time, as a result of which pollination\r\ncannot take place. Moreover, late spring frosts often destroy one or\r\nboth sets of flowers, and the result, as far as fruit is concerned, is\r\nthe same in either case. As a result of these experiences, the pecan\r\ncannot be recommended as a nut-bearing tree north of its natural range\r\nin the Mississippi Valley, neither will it succeed at the high\r\nelevations in the Alleghany mountains. It reaches its most northerly\r\ncultural extension in the Mississippi valley and in the coastal plain of\r\nthe Atlantic seaboard. But it grows well and makes a good shade tree\r\nfarther north, and at elevations far above its native range. Even then,\r\nhowever, the nuts from which these seedling shade trees are grown should\r\nbe brought from the northern sections of its natural distribution. They\r\nare much more likely to withstand the rigorous cold of winter.\r\n\r\nFrequently the question is asked as to whether the pecan can be grown in\r\na certain given locality. Such a question can be answered only in the\r\nmost general way. The presence of the larger species of hickories in the\r\nvicinity may be used in some parts of the country as an indication of\r\nthe success which might attend the planting of pecan trees, but such a\r\nguide should not be followed too implicitly, and even if the pecan tree\r\nshould grow well, fruit might not be secured.\r\n\r\nThe presence of pecan trees, single specimens perhaps, or two or three,\r\nin yards or about buildings here and there throughout a region, may be\r\ntaken as a guide in the matter of planting, and no better can be had.\r\nNothing will take the place of a practical demonstration in the way of a\r\nvigorous fruiting tree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nPECAN BOTANY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe aborigines of the country used hickory nuts of different kinds as\r\nfood, and in the region in which the pecan grows as a native tree, it\r\nwas valued by them above all its relatives.\r\n\r\nPenicaut found in his travels that the Indians stored large amounts of\r\npecans for winter use. The scientific name of the pecan is appropriately\r\nderived from two Indian words, \"powcohiccora\" and \"pacan.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1785, the pecan was described under the name _Juglans Pecan_, by\r\nMarshall in his Arboretum Americanum. In 1818, Thomas Nuttall, an\r\nEnglish botanist, separated the hickories from the walnuts and\r\nbutternuts, putting them under a new genus which he called _Carya_,\r\nnaming the pecan _Carya olivaeformis_. Nuttall's classification was\r\nfollowed for many years until it was found that in the year previous to\r\nthe publication of his work, 1817, C. S. Rafinesque, a French\r\nnaturalist, had separated the hickories along the same lines as Nuttall\r\nand published them under the name _Hicoria_. In accordance with the laws\r\nof priority, Rafinesque's name, _Hicoria_, takes precedence over\r\n_Carya_.\r\n\r\nThe family _Juglandaceæ_, embraces but two genera, _Juglans_ and\r\n_Hicoria_, the former including the walnuts and butternuts, and the\r\nlatter the pecan and other hickories. With the exception of the\r\nShellbark hickory, _Hicoria ovata_ Britton, and the Big shellbark,\r\n_Hicoria laciniosa_ Sargent, the pecan is the only one of the genus\r\nworthy of cultivation.\r\n\r\n_Family._ Juglandaceæ Lindl.

Pecan Flowers. Pistillate enlarged below.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLLINATION.\r\n\r\nSince two kinds of flowers are produced on the pecan, one bearing the\r\npistils, the other stamens, the pollen must be transferred from the\r\nlatter to the former in order that pollination may take place. In many\r\nplants the pollen is transferred from one plant or flower to another by\r\nmeans of insects; but in the pecan there are no bright colors, no\r\nnectar, no scent to attract insects to carry pollen, but, instead, the\r\nwind is the carrying agent and it needs no attractions. Pollen is\r\nproduced in large quantities, necessarily so, since much of it is\r\nwasted.\r\n\r\nUnfavorable weather conditions at time of blooming may, however,\r\ninterfere seriously with pollination. Heavy winds or wind-storms, and\r\nrains of several days duration, may prevent the necessary and desired\r\ndistribution of the pollen, as a result of which no fruit is formed.\r\n\r\nSometimes the staminate blooms are destroyed by frost while the\r\npistillate ones escape. It makes little difference which is destroyed,\r\nhowever, as in either case the result is the same--no fruit sets.\r\n\r\nThe staminate flowers push out from the lateral buds at the same time\r\nthe new shoot develops from the terminal one. The pistillate blossom\r\ndoes not appear until the terminal shoot has grown six or eight inches,\r\nand in the meantime it is protected by the unfolded leaves. The\r\nstaminate bloom, on the contrary, is exposed from the first, having no\r\nleaves to protect it. In consequence it is much more likely to be cut\r\noff by frost. Dr. Trelease refers to several observations on proterandry\r\n(maturing of the pollen before the stigmas of the pistils) in the pecan.\r\nThis, together with the unprotected condition of the staminate blooms,\r\nwe believe, accounts in a large measure for the non-setting of fruit on\r\nthe northern boundaries of the pecan area.\r\n\r\nThe artificial or hand pollination of the pecan is an easy matter and\r\noffers an inviting field for those interested in plant breeding.\r\nEmasculation, or the removal of the stamens from the flowers necessary\r\nin breeding so many plants, is not necessary in the pecan. All that is\r\nneeded is to cover the pistillate blossoms with a sack until they are\r\nmatured. At this time the inner or stigmatic surfaces of the pistils\r\nwill be exposed and ready for the pollen. The pollen, collected from\r\nadjoining trees in bloom or brought from a distance, can then be placed\r\nupon the stigmas and the sack replaced. When the fruit is set, the paper\r\nsack should be replaced by one of mosquito netting. Some careful work\r\nhas already been done along this line, and it is hoped that many more\r\nwill take up the work. Much yet remains to be desired, and varieties may\r\nbe better adapted to different sections. The ideal, large, full-meated,\r\nthin-shelled, prolific and precocious variety of pecan has not yet been\r\nbrought forward. It may be accidentally discovered; it may be produced\r\nand can be produced by systematic, painstaking work in breeding. It is\r\nhoped that the number of workers in this inviting field may be\r\nincreased. Some may be deterred by the fact that it will take the\r\nseedlings so long to come into bearing. But scions may be taken from the\r\nseedlings raised from cross-bred nuts, top-worked on large trees, and\r\nfruit could be obtained in many cases in a period not exceeding five or\r\nsix years from the seed. Those which would not produce fruit in six\r\nyears in this way might perhaps as well be discarded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II.\r\n\r\nVarieties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nVARIETIES OF PECANS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the list of varieties of pecans is comparatively small, yet a\r\nsurprisingly large number of names has been used. The attempt has been\r\nmade to collect all the names which have appeared in different\r\npublications. These have presumably all been applied to some pecan at\r\nsome time or other, but many of them have never been propagated by\r\nbudding or grafting and a very large proportion of them have been lost\r\ntrack of entirely. In short, they are now represented by names only.\r\nHowever, they are all given, for the reason that it would be well not to\r\napply any of these names to other varieties. It might be well to\r\nemphasize the fact that many meritorious varieties would be the better\r\nfor re-naming.\r\n\r\nIn the original descriptions, it will be noted that the thickness of the\r\nshell is given in millimeters. A piece of the shell about the center of\r\nthe side covering the back of the half kernels, was accurately measured.\r\nThese measurements must not be regarded as absolute, but they are\r\ncomparative. All nut illustrations are natural size.\r\n\r\nFor the origin and synonomy of many varieties credit must be given to\r\nthe excellent work of Mr. William A. Taylor, of the United States\r\nDepartment of Agriculture, who has probably done more than any one else\r\nto straighten out the tangled nomenclature of the pecan.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASSIFICATION OF VARIETIES.\r\n\r\nHeretofore, no attempt has been made to group or classify the different\r\nvarieties of pecans. Classification does not become necessary until the\r\nnumber of varieties has increased sufficiently. The following\r\nclassification of the varieties with which the author is acquainted, is\r\nbased entirely upon the shape of the nuts. No classification of those\r\nvarieties of which descriptions are copied has been attempted, as the\r\ndescriptions are frequently so meagre as to render it impossible:\r\n\r\n     1. _Varieties:_ Hound or roundish oblong. Types--Post, Hollis,\r\n     Money-maker.\r\n\r\n     Bacon, Bolton, Extra Early, Georgia, Hollis, Money-maker, Post,\r\n     Randall, San Saba, Thomas.\r\n\r\n     2. _Varieties:_ Oblong, rounded at the base, blunt and\r\n     quadrangular at the apex.

Mr. Wilson's mother planted\r\n     four trees from nuts secured from a tree at Surry Courthouse,\r\n     Va., the Mantura being one of the four, The parent tree\r\n     measures about fourteen feet around the body, and bears crops\r\n     of good sized nuts.

E. Pabst, Ocean Springs, Miss. Originated\r\n     by and named for B. M. Young, Morgan City, Louisiana.\r\n\r\n\r\nHYBRID PECANS.\r\n\r\nThe pecan appears to inter-pollinate freely with some of the other\r\nspecies of hickory, particularly _H. minima_, _H. laciniosa_ and _H.\r\nalba_. A number of what are believed to be well-marked hybrids of the\r\npecan with these different species have been found, the most noteworthy\r\nof which, perhaps, are given below:\r\n\r\n     MCCALLISTER. (Syn.: _Floyd_.) Received from O. L. McCallister,\r\n     Mount Vernon, Ind. This is probably a hybrid. It is the largest\r\n     nut among all the hickories received at this office. The hull\r\n     is about one-fourth of an inch thick when dry, and opens\r\n     readily to the base with four valves. Nut 2-1/8 inches long,\r\n     1-5/16 inches wide, and 1-1/16 inches thick; base broad,\r\n     rounded; apex broad, blunt, angular. In compressed form, in\r\n     color of nut, also in the angularity and thickness of shell, it\r\n     is quite similar to shellbark hickory. The kernel of a\r\n     well-filled specimen is in color, consistency and flavor more\r\n     like a shellbark of high quality than a pecan. The tree is\r\n     reported to be \"so similar to pecan in bark and leaf that it\r\n     would be impossible to detect the difference,\" yet the buds and\r\n     young wood more closely resemble shellbark. The tree was found\r\n     many years ago on a farm now owned by Mr. McCallister. The nuts\r\n     have little pomological value, as grown on the original tree\r\n     some years, the kernel being shriveled and not filling more\r\n     than one-third of the space within the shell; yet nuts from the\r\n     crop of 1893 have been received at the Division of Pomology\r\n     which were well filled with a kernel of very pleasant flavor.\r\n     Possibly it may become more uniform in maturing fruit in\r\n     Mississippi or Texas, where the season is longer than in\r\n     Indiana. It is well worth a trial by experimenters in those\r\n     States. Sargent gives a short description of this nut under the\r\n     name Floyd, and accredits the points of his description to A.\r\n     S. Fuller in New York Tribune, weekly edition, July 9th, 1892,\r\n     and says it is perhaps a hybrid. (Nut Culture in the United\r\n     States, 1896, p. 63-4.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: (_Photo by Dr. Wm. Trelease._)\r\n\r\nFIG. 14.\r\n\r\nThe Nussbaumer Hybrid.]\r\n\r\n     NUSSBAUMER. In the American Agriculturist for 1884, p. 546,\r\n     fol., A. S. Fuller published an account of a supposed hybrid\r\n     between this species and the pecan, which has been called the\r\n     Nussbaumer hybrid, after J. J. Nussbaumer, of Okawville, Ill.,\r\n     who first brought it to the attention of Judge Samuel Miller,\r\n     of Bluffton, Mo. Mr. Nussbaumer writes me that the original\r\n     tree, which stands in the bottom between Mascoutah and\r\n     Fayetteville, Ill., in general appearance resembles laciniosa,\r\n     though the bark is intermediate between that of the Pecan and\r\n     Mockernut. Prof. Sargent states (Silva, vii, 158) that a small\r\n     tree grown from this in New Jersey, by Mr. Fuller, cannot be\r\n     distinguished from laciniosa of the same age; and I should\r\n     hardly be able to distinguish an imperfect twig from a small\r\n     tree, cultivated by Judge Miller, from laciniosa. The nut,\r\n     however, is very peculiar, being more elongated than is usual\r\n     in that species, and widened upwardly, less acutely angled \"as\r\n     if the ridges had been sandpapered down,\" and so thin-shelled\r\n     that it can be crushed easily by pressing two together in the\r\n     palm of the hand. A somewhat similar nut, originally from\r\n     Indiana, was described by Mr. Fuller In the New York Weekly\r\n     Tribune, July 9, 1892 (Sargent's Silva, l.c.), as cultivated by\r\n     R. M. Floyd, of Cedar Rapids, Iowa. And in the autumn of 1895,\r\n     Dr. J. Schneck sent me ample fruit, twig and leaf specimens of\r\n     a similar hickory from Posey county, Indiana. The nut of this\r\n     last is almost identical with a specimen of the Nussbaumer nut\r\n     in the Englemann herbarium, while its twigs closely resemble\r\n     those of laciniosa, and the leaves are decidedly of the pecan\r\n     type. I am led to the conclusion, therefore, that these several\r\n     forms really represent hybrids between H. pecan and H.\r\n     laciniosa. In size, quality, and thinness of shell they appear\r\n     to be the most valuable of American nuts. (Trelease, Wm., 7th\r\n     Report Mo. Bot. Garden, 1896, pp. 40-41.)\r\n\r\n     POOSHEE. Size small, 1-1/4 x 7/8 x 3/4 inches; ovate, flattened\r\n     wedged, sutures prominent; color dull brown with a very few\r\n     dark lines at the apex; base rounded; apex flattened abruptly,\r\n     short pointed; shell medium in thickness, 1.5 mm.; partitions\r\n     thin, 4-celled at base; kernel rounded in outline, light yellow\r\n     in color, sutures broad, shallow, halves indented at base;\r\n     surface much wrinkled and corrugated; flavor sweetish.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15. H. Minima and two of its hybrids, Westbrook and\r\nPooshee.]\r\n\r\n     Specimens of this nut were secured from Dr. J. F. Wilson,\r\n     Poulan, Ga., who received them from Prof. Burgess, Clemson\r\n     College, S. C. The nut presents exactly the same\r\n     characteristics as the Westbrook, except in flavor and color of\r\n     kernel. It, too, is doubtless a hybrid, _H. minima_ x _H.\r\n     pecan_. The original tree of this variety stands by or in the\r\n     old Ravenel cemetery, near Pinopolis, Berkely county, S. C.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by Dr. Wm. Trelease._\r\n\r\nFIG. 16. The Schneck Hybrid.]\r\n\r\n     SCHNECK. In the autumn of 1894, Dr. J. Schneck, of Mt. Carmel,\r\n     Ill., and F. Reppert, of Muscatine, Iowa, sent to the\r\n     herbarium twigs and fruit of bottom-land trees that appear to\r\n     be hybrids of this species with the pecan. The bark of the Iowa\r\n     tree is described as being much like that of the Mockernut,\r\n     while the tree of Dr. Schneck is smooth-barked, resembling the\r\n     pecan. So far as I have seen them, the twigs of both might pass\r\n     for those of alba, except that the outer scales of the\r\n     terminal buds are persistent, while the foliage, though\r\n     intermediate, is strongly suggestive of that of the pecan. The\r\n     fruit is oblong, almost 2 inches long, the husk 6 mm. thick,\r\n     parted nearly to the base, with strongly elevated margins to\r\n     the segments, and rather persistent on the tree. The nuts are\r\n     nearly as pale as in the Shagbark, conspicuously brown striped,\r\n     slightly 4-celled at the very base, and with a wall only 1 mm.\r\n     thick. As is usual in ALBA, they are upwardly attenuate, and\r\n     frequently the kernel is abortive. (Trelease, Wm., 7th Report\r\n     Mo. Bot. Garden, 1896, pp. 44-45.)\r\n\r\n     WESTBROOK. Size small, 1-3/8 x 7/8 inches; ovate, flattened,\r\n     prominently sutured; color brown with a few indistinct brownish\r\n     streaks close to the apex; base rounded; apex wedge-shaped,\r\n     ridge, abruptly-pointed; shell rough and irregular, thin, 8.5\r\n     mm.; partitions rather thin, 4-celled at base; kernel\r\n     reddish-brown, much wrinkled, sutures of moderate width and\r\n     depth, halves divided at the base, much corrugated in cross\r\n     section; flavor decidedly bitter and puckery.\r\n\r\n     The parent tree is one standing in the yard of J. H. Westbrook,\r\n     Mt. Olive, N. C., and grew from what, to all appearances, was a\r\n     pecan nut. The foliage and general aspect of the tree closely\r\n     resembles the pecan, though the serrations on the leaves are\r\n     coarser and larger. The fruit resembles, in many respects, that\r\n     of _Hicoria minima_, and, in short, it appears to be a\r\n     well-marked hybrid between that species and _Hicoria pecan_.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[C] Taylor, Wm.

To enable growers,\r\nnurserymen and judges to work on a common standard of merit, a scale of\r\npoints, in which each individual characteristic of the nut may receive a\r\ncertain fixed number of credits, is indispensable.\r\n\r\nAt the second annual meeting of the National Nut Growers' Association,\r\nheld in New Orleans, the following scale of points for judging pecans\r\nwas adopted:\r\n\r\n                    PECAN NUTS.\r\n\r\n     _External characters._              _Points._\r\n        Size,                               20\r\n        Form,                                5\r\n        Color,                               5\r\n     _Shell characters._\r\n        Thinness,                           10\r\n        Cracking quality,                   20\r\n     _Kernel characters._\r\n        Plumpness,                          20\r\n        Color,                               5\r\n        Quality,                            15\r\n                                          -----\r\n               Total,                      100\r\n\r\n     _Tree._                             _Points._\r\n        Vigor,                              10\r\n        Habit,                              10\r\n        Toughness,                          10\r\n        Resistance to disease, insects,     10\r\n        Precocity,                          10\r\n        Uniformity of ripening,             10\r\n        Productiveness,                     40\r\n                                          -----\r\n               Total,                      100\r\n\r\nThe rating of a variety to be determined by averaging the rating of nut\r\nand tree.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPLANATORY NOTES, CHARACTER AND CONDITION OF SAMPLES.\r\n\r\nAll samples submitted for judging shall be fair average samples of the\r\ncrop and not selected specimens. They should he tree-ripened, and should\r\nbe thoroughly cured before judging. Polishing, coloring or other\r\nmanipulation to disqualify:\r\n\r\n     _Size_--The nuts should be large and reasonably uniform in\r\n     size; nuts running smaller than 100 per pound, to be\r\n     disqualified.\r\n\r\n     _Form_--The nuts should be symmetrical in form and reasonably\r\n     smooth of surface.\r\n\r\n     _Color_--The shell should be bright and clear in color without\r\n     excess of surface markings.\r\n\r\n     _Thinness_--the shell should be sufficiently thin in proportion\r\n     to size of nut to crush readily.\r\n\r\n     _Cracking Quality_--The shell should be brittle and should\r\n     separate readily from the kernel leaving it clean and in\r\n     perfect halves.\r\n\r\n     _Plumpness_--The kernel should fill the shell and must be\r\n     smooth, externally, with solid meat of fine and uniform\r\n     texture, free from internal cavities and with high relative\r\n     weight of kernel to shell.\r\n\r\n     _Color_--The kernel should be uniformly bright and attractive\r\n     in color.\r\n\r\n     _Quality_--The flavor should be sweet and rich, free from\r\n     bitterness or astringence of either meat or skin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III.\r\n\r\nCultural.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nPROPAGATION OF THE PECAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe pecan tree is difficult of propagation by budding or grafting.\r\nSkillful propagators are satisfied with seventy-five per cent. of living\r\nbuds or grafts, while very many have to be content with less. The\r\ndifficulty is due, in part, to lack of skill; in part to lack of\r\njudgment in selecting good material with which to work; but in some\r\nregions it is due to the attacks of the bud-worm, _Proteopteryx\r\ndeludana_, more than to anything else. The buds are eaten out and\r\ndestroyed by this insect at the time they start into growth. In certain\r\nsections spring working of pecans has been abandoned entirely owing to\r\nthe destruction wrought by this pest. But notwithstanding all the\r\ndrawbacks, pecan trees can be, should be and are propagated in large\r\nnumbers by budding and grafting, and the seedling is becoming more and\r\nmore a thing of the past.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEEDLING VS. GRAFTED TREES.\r\n\r\nIt is a fact worthy of note that the beginning of every tree-fruit\r\nindustry is marked by the use of seedling trees. In the later stages of\r\nthe development of the industry the seedling, owing to a more intimate\r\nknowledge of its failings and shortcomings, gives way to the grafted[I]\r\ntree. This stage has already been reached in pecan orcharding.\r\n\r\nIt has been stated that a certain percentage of pecans would produce\r\nnuts identical with those of the parent tree. The author has yet to find\r\nthe first instance in which this was the case. This truth is borne out\r\nby the observations of others.\r\n\r\nIn view of the fact just stated, if a planter desires to secure a\r\ncertain definite fixed variety of pecan, it can only be done by planting\r\ngrafted trees. Even though all the seedlings were of good size, yet the\r\nvariation in time of ripening, quality, prolificness, form and size\r\nwould be against them. Take a certain quantity of each of a number of\r\nour largest pecans--Stuart, Van Deman, Centennial and Frotscher for\r\ninstance--mix them together, and under average circumstances the mixed\r\nlot will sell for less money in the open market than the same varieties\r\nand the same nuts would if marketed separately. Mixed nuts, no matter\r\nhow good the quality, cannot compete successfully in the market with a\r\nsingle uniform sample of the same or nearly the same quality.\r\n\r\nGrafted trees will come into bearing at an earlier age than seedlings.\r\nIn the case of seedlings it is very difficult to say when they will\r\nbegin to bear, while grafted trees of the more precocious varieties may\r\nbe expected to bear quite a little fruit in six or eight years from the\r\ntime of planting.\r\n\r\nThe great objection to grafted trees is the first cost, and yet, in the\r\nface of that objection, it is best to plant grafted trees even if fewer\r\nof them are planted. If grafted trees are out of the question, then\r\nplant seedlings and top-work them. Grow the seedlings from nuts if\r\nnecessary; but to those who live in sections where pecans can be grown,\r\nlet me say, _plant pecan trees_; plant budded or grafted trees if you\r\ncan--but plant pecan trees.\r\n\r\n\r\nPECAN STOCKS.\r\n\r\nNursery trees are propagated entirely on pecan stocks, and in the\r\npresent state of our knowledge, it is the best stock to use. It may be\r\nthat the pecan will grow and thrive as well on a number of different\r\nspecies of hickory, but definite information bearing on this point is\r\nlacking. _Hicoria tomentosa_, _H. alba_, and _H. aquatica_ have been\r\nused for stocks in North Carolina, Florida, and other States, the pecan\r\nbeing top-worked upon them. But for the present, at least, until our\r\nexperimental knowledge is farther advanced, the safest advice is to use\r\npecan stock only.\r\n\r\nToo little attention on the part of propagators has been given to the\r\nkind, source and quality of the seed used to raise stocks for\r\npropagation work. The main object held in view in making a selection for\r\nseed purposes is to get just as many nuts as possible in the pound. The\r\nresult of this policy is, that, without question, inferior seedlings are\r\noften used for stock; they lack stamina and vigor. Frequently in a\r\nnursery of budded or grafted stocks, or in a young pecan orchard, a wide\r\nvariation in the size and vigor of the trees can be noticed. No\r\nsatisfactory explanation has ever been offered, but there seems little\r\nreason to doubt that it is due to the use of heterogenous lots of seed\r\nfor stock purposes. _The point must be emphasized, that greater care\r\nshould be exercised in the selection of the seed used in nursery work._\r\nNuts from rapid-growing, vigorous, healthy trees only should be used. It\r\nis best to plant in spring only nuts which matured the previous autumn.\r\nPreferably these nuts should be of fair or medium size for the variety\r\nto give the young seedling a fair start in life.\r\n\r\nAs already pointed out in regard to pecan shade trees for more\r\nnortherly regions, so in the case of pecan nuts for use in raising\r\nstocks in northern sections. It is best to secure nuts from trees near\r\nthe northern limits of nut production.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTORING AND PLANTING SEED NUTS.\r\n\r\nIf pecan nuts, intended for seed purposes, are stored and kept as nuts\r\nordinarily are kept, they become dried out. Before they will germinate\r\nthe following spring they must absorb all the moisture lost and\r\nconsiderably more; in consequence of which they are slow in starting. If\r\ntoo thoroughly dried out, many may fail to germinate.\r\n\r\nTo obviate this, and to insure better and more prompt germination, it is\r\nbest to keep the seed nuts in moist sand or clay during the winter\r\nmonths. Procure a sufficient number of shallow boxes or trays; three\r\nfeet by one and a half feet by six or eight inches will answer nicely.\r\nThese are to be used in stratifying the nuts. The earth to be used\r\nshould preferably be good clean sand, free from organic matter, or, if\r\nthis cannot be secured, clay will answer. Place a layer of the earth\r\nabout one inch deep in the bottom of the boxes, then a single layer of\r\nnuts, then a two-inch layer of earth, and so on in alternating layers\r\nuntil the boxes are filled. These should then be slightly moistened and\r\nset aside in a sheltered place and covered with pine straw, leaves or\r\nstraw.\r\n\r\nIn spring, when germination has just begun in the nuts and the tiny\r\nsprouts are beginning to appear, they should be planted in rows. The\r\nground should be deeply plowed, well broken up, pulverized, and made\r\nmoderately rich. Ground which produced a heavy crop of cowpeas, velvet\r\nbeans or beggarweed the previous season is excellent for the purpose.\r\nFarm-yard manure, well decomposed and plowed in the autumn previous, is\r\none of the best manures to use. The ground should be lined off in\r\nperfectly straight rows four feet apart, running east and west, that,\r\nthe buds may be inserted on the north side. The nuts should be planted\r\nfour or five inches deep, depending upon their size and the character of\r\nthe soil. Large nuts should be planted deeper than small ones, and in\r\nheavy soils nuts may be planted somewhat nearer the surface than in\r\nlight sandy ones. The rows may be opened with a small turning plow, or,\r\nfor lesser areas, with a shovel. Place the nuts, a foot apart, carefully\r\nin the bottom of the furrow, cover with a hoe, roll the ground if the\r\nweather is dry, and then scarify the surface with a weeder or a light\r\nharrow to prevent evaporation of the soil moisture. Or the ground may be\r\nmulched with pine-straw, grass, leaves or other suitable material. If no\r\nmulch is applied, then the surface of the ground Should be cultivated\r\nshallow from time to time.\r\n\r\nSome propagators have adopted the plan, with good results, of planting\r\nthe nuts in the nursery rows, in late fall.\r\n\r\n\r\nCULTIVATION OF NURSERY SEEDLINGS.\r\n\r\nFrom the time the young shoots begin to appear above the surface\r\nfrequent shallow cultivation should be given. Once every ten days or two\r\nweeks is not too often, and the ground should be broken to a depth of\r\none inch or so after every shower of rain. During dry weather more\r\nfrequent cultivation, once every week, will be well repaid in the\r\nadditional growth and vigor of the seedlings. A good commercial\r\nfertilizer, analyzing 5 per cent. phosphoric acid, 6 per cent. potash\r\nand 4 per cent. nitrogen, may be applied to advantage at the rate of\r\nfifteen hundred or two thousand pounds per acre. By the following\r\nautumn, the better seedlings will have ten or twelve inches of top, and\r\ntwo and a half or three feet of taproot. The following spring some may\r\nhe whip-grafted at the crown, and by June, July and August of the same\r\nyear many of them should have attained sufficient size for budding.\r\nThose which are not of sufficient size at this time can be worked the\r\nfollowing spring and summer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE IV. A Pecan Nursery.\r\n\r\n_Photo by J. F. Jones._]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NECESSARY MATERIALS AND TOOLS.\r\n\r\nThe materials and tools used in grafting and budding are: a grafting\r\niron, a mallet, budding knives, grafting wax, strips of waxed cloth and\r\ntwine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17. Grafting Iron.]\r\n\r\nOf grafting irons there are a number of different kinds, but one after\r\nthe general type shown in Fig. 17, works very well. It will be noticed\r\nthat the blade is curved at the corners, and the edge instead of being\r\nstraight is curved downward in the center. This type of blade in some\r\nmeasure prevents the bruising of the bark when splitting the branch in\r\ncleft-grafting. Such a grafting iron may be made by almost any\r\nblacksmith. However, a good stout knife may be used instead.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18. Common Budding Knife.]\r\n\r\nFor use in grafting, an ordinary budding knife, one of which is\r\nillustrated in Fig. 18, is well nigh indispensable. No other knife is so\r\nwell adapted to making the smooth, sloping cuts on the scions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: White's Budding Tool.\r\n\r\nGalbreath's Budding Tool.\r\n\r\nNelson's Budding Tool.\r\n\r\nPLATE V.]\r\n\r\nSome persons can insert annular and veneer shield buds rapidly and well\r\nwith nothing but an ordinary budding knife. In general, however, a\r\nbudding knife having two blades, placed parallel with a space of\r\nthree-quarters of an inch or an inch apart, is best. A very satisfactory\r\nknife may be made by fastening the blades of two ordinary budding knives\r\non the sides of a piece of wood seven-eighths of an inch square and four\r\ninches in length. The blades can be firmly held in place by means of\r\nrivets and a piece of wire wound about the whole.\r\n\r\nThree special budding knives, for use in pecan budding, have been\r\nintroduced, one by Mr. Herbert C. White, of DeWitt, Ga., one by Mr. D.\r\nGalbreath, of New Orleans, La., and the other by Mr. Wm. Nelson, of New\r\nOrleans, La. In these knives the blades are fixed seven-eighths of an\r\ninch, one and one-eighth inch, and three-fourths of an inch apart,\r\nrespectively. These make it possible to cut the buds and the place where\r\nthey are to be inserted on the stock exactly the same size, an essential\r\npoint in pecan budding. They have not yet come into general use,\r\nalthough well recommended by some who have used them. The White budding\r\ntool is particularly well adapted for use in top-working trees.\r\n\r\nA good grafting wax may be made according to a number of different\r\nformulas. Either of the following will be found satisfactory:\r\n\r\n        {Resin          6 pounds.\r\n     I. {Beeswax        2 pounds.\r\n        {Linseed Oil    1 pound.\r\n\r\n        {Resin          4 pounds.\r\n     II.{Beeswax        1 pound.\r\n        {Linseed Oil    1 pint.\r\n\r\nBreak the resin and cut the beeswax into small pieces. Place in an iron\r\nvessel, pour the oil over them and melt over a slow fire. Stir slightly\r\nto insure their being well mixed together, pour out into a bucket of\r\ncold water, grease the hands, and as soon as the mass is cool enough to\r\nhandle, pull until it becomes light yellow in color. The wax may be made\r\nup in quantity and stored in greased tin or wooden boxes for future use.\r\n\r\nTo prepare waxed cloth, cut the cotton cloth into pieces of convenient\r\nsize, say eighteen inches square, dip them down into the melted wax,\r\nremove them with a couple of sticks and stretch them out until cooled.\r\nFor use, the cloth may be torn into strips of desired width and wound\r\nabout a stick eighteen inches or so in length. Use a little grease to\r\nprevent the grafting wax and grafting cloth from sticking to the hands.\r\n\r\nFor waxed twine, procure No. 18 knitting cotton and drop the balls into\r\nthe melted wax for a minute or two or until the wax penetrates them.\r\n\r\n\r\nSELECTION OF SCIONS.\r\n\r\nGreat care should be exercised in the selection of scions for use in\r\nbudding and grafting. Much of the immediate success of the work depends\r\nupon the character of the scions, while the health and longevity of the\r\nfuture tree may be materially influenced by the kind of wood used in\r\npropagating work.\r\n\r\nThe practice of taking scions and buds from young trees which have never\r\nborne, or from nursery stuck, must be strongly condemned. They should be\r\ncut only from thrifty, vigorous, prolific trees. Even trees of the same\r\nvariety differ in these things, and a thorough knowledge of what a tree\r\nwill do and has done is the only true guide in the selection of scions.\r\nIt is a well-known fact that desirable qualities can be reproduced and\r\nperpetuated by grafting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From Bul. 57, Florida Exp. Sta._\r\n\r\nFIG. 19. Scions: 1-3, Curtis; 4-6, Van Deman; 7-8, Stuart. 1. Poor\r\nScions--long, slender, pithy. 2,4,5,7,8. Scions from one year's growth.\r\n3. Scion, partly one, partly two years old. 6. Scion with cut, back of\r\ntip. 8. Scion which bore fruit at a.]\r\n\r\nGrafts should be selected from well-matured branches of one year's\r\ngrowth. Fig. 19, No. 1, shows an undesirable scion. The wood is angular,\r\nsmall, the internodes long, and the pith large in proportion to the\r\ndiameter. Either terminal portions of twigs may be used or portions back\r\nof the tip, but the buds should always be well developed, full and\r\nplump--Fig. 19, Nos. 2 to 6. For this reason grafts should not be cut\r\nfrom wood far back from the tip of the branch. As stated, twigs of the\r\nprevious season's growth are generally used, but scions composed partly\r\nof two-year-old wood may be used, provided the growth is not too large.\r\nFig. 19, No. 3, shows one of these. Grafts are generally cut about five\r\nor six inches long, and should be from one-quarter to three-eighths of\r\nan inch in thickness.\r\n\r\nIt is best that the grafts be cut while still in a dormant state, and\r\ninserted in the stock just before the growth starts. The scions may be\r\nkept for a considerable length of time by placing them, loosely packed,\r\nin damp moss or sawdust, in a box. The box should be covered over with\r\nearth and the scions kept sufficiently moist to prevent drying out.\r\n\r\nFor bud sticks, well developed one-year-old branches, one-half to\r\nseven-eighths of an inch in diameter, and on which the buds are well\r\nformed, may be used. Such sticks frequently show three buds at a node,\r\nand if some misfortune should overtake one or two of these, there is\r\nstill a chance of success, though the upper one being the strongest is\r\ngenerally the one which starts, provided it is uninjured and the bud\r\ntakes. The degree of maturity of the bud is important, and care should\r\nbe exercised that only those which are plump, full and well developed,\r\nare used. As soon as removed from the tree all bud sticks and grafts\r\nshould be wrapped in damp newspapers to prevent drying out.\r\n\r\n\r\nTIME.\r\n\r\nGrafts should be inserted in spring just before or at the time growth\r\nstarts. Buds may be inserted any time during the period when the bark\r\nwill slip readily. Last year's dormant buds may be inserted early in the\r\nseason, or buds of the current season's growth may be used during the\r\nlatter part of July and the month of August, at which time they have\r\nbecome fully matured in the southernmost parts of the Gulf States. The\r\ntime may even be extended into September. Very many of these\r\nlate-inserted buds remain dormant during winter and begin growth in\r\nspring.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUDDING.\r\n\r\n_Annular Budding._--A ring of bark about one inch in length is removed\r\nfrom the stock. A bud stick of the same size is selected, and from it a\r\nsimilar ring with a good bud on it is removed by cutting around the bud\r\nstick and slitting down the back or side opposite the bud. This bud is\r\nthen placed in position on the stock. After the buds are in place, a\r\npiece of stiff wrapping paper should be tied around the stock just above\r\nthe bud and allowed to flare out over the bud to protect it from the sun\r\nand wind. Preferably all buds should be inserted on the north side.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From Bul. 57, Florida Exp. Sta._\r\n\r\nFIG. 20. Annular Budding. 1. Stock prepared for bud. 2. Bud. 3. Bud in\r\nplace and tied.]\r\n\r\nStocks from three-eighths to three-quarters of an inch may be worked by\r\nthis method.\r\n\r\n_Veneer Shield-Budding. (Patch Budding)._ This method differs from the\r\nlast only in that the piece of bark removed from the stock and the piece\r\nwith the bud attached are not complete rings, but only parts. A\r\nrectangular or even a triangular piece of bark is taken out of the\r\nstock, a similar piece with a bud in its center taken from the bud\r\nstick is fitted in its place and wrapped in the usual way.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: From Bul. 57, Florida Exp. Sta.\r\n\r\nFIG. 21. Veneer Shield-Budding.]\r\n\r\nMr. George W. Oliver, of the Bureau of Plant Industry, Washington, D.\r\nC., has described[J] a modified method of veneer shield-budding, which\r\nhas given good satisfaction in his hands. Instead of removing the patch\r\nfrom the stock, it is slit down the center from top to bottom and the\r\nedges are lifted back, the buds inserted beneath and the side flaps are\r\nthen tied down over it. He has also found that dormant buds of last\r\nyear's growth give better results than buds of the current season.\r\n\r\nThe use of these buds has not, however, come into general use; first,\r\nbecause of the large amount of wood which must be destroyed to secure\r\nthem; and second, because in those sections where bud-worms are\r\nprevalent, their larvæ are to be found clustered about the buds until\r\nquite late in the season and make their attack as soon as the bud starts\r\nto grow.\r\n\r\nMr. E. W. Kirkpatrick,[K] McKinney, Texas, described a method\r\nsuccessfully used by him, as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"We prepare the stock to receive the bud by cutting out a\r\n     section of bark and wood as shown in Fig. 22. The bud is cut\r\n     from the scion in the same way the cut on the stock is made. It\r\n     should be about the same length, width, thickness and shape of\r\n     the bark removed from the stock (see Fig. 22), so that the bud\r\n     will fit the stock. * * * * The bud should be firmly tied until\r\n     growth begins, usually about twenty-five days, when the string\r\n     should be cut and the stock also cut just above the bud. * * *\r\n     All shoots must be kept rubbed off so as to give the buds the\r\n     right of way. The small buds about the base of the scions or\r\n     those on the two-year-old wood are preferred. Where the buds\r\n     are small and in a cluster, several may be included in one set\r\n     and the thinning done after the growth starts.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22. Chip Budding. Bud cut; Incision made; Bud in\r\nplace.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGRAFTING.\r\n\r\n_Cleft Grafting._ Having selected the branch for cleft grafting and the\r\npoint at which the scions are to be inserted, the branch should be\r\ncarefully and smoothly cut off. The limb is then split by using the\r\ngrafting iron. If rapid work is to be done, grafts should be prepared\r\nbeforehand and carried to the field, wrapped in damp paper. In preparing\r\nthe scion, a sloping cut should be made about one and one-half inches\r\nlong, cutting into the pith from a point one-half way up the cut down to\r\nthe lower end. On the opposite side, the cut should not be made to touch\r\nthe pith, but should be confined to woody tissue throughout its whole\r\nlength. The knife should have a keen, sharp edge. The cut should be\r\nclean, smooth and straight, and the scion should be left wider on the\r\nouter side. Start the cuts on each side of, and just at a bud, as shown\r\nin Fig. 23. Having made the cleft, it is opened with the wedge on the\r\nend of the grafting iron and the scion is placed in position. The\r\ncambium layers should be in contact. Slip the scion well down until the\r\nwhole of the cut surface is within the cleft. If the stock is large\r\nenough insert two scions. After inserting the scion it should be firmly\r\nheld in place by binding the stocks with strips of waxed cloth, after\r\nwhich a covering of wax may be placed over the cloth. The cut end of the\r\nstock should be covered, and if the scion be other than a terminal\r\nshoot, its distal end should be waxed also.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bul. 57, Fla. Exp. Sta.\r\n\r\nFIG. 23.

Scion. 3. Stock and\r\nScion ready for bandage.]\r\n\r\n_Whip Grafting._ Branches, which are to be worked by whip grafting,\r\nshould be less than one inch in diameter. The method is illustrated in\r\nFig. 24. A sloping cut, an inch and a half long, is made diagonally\r\nacross the stock. A corresponding cut is made on the scion, a tongue is\r\nraised about the center of each cut by making another cut with the\r\nbudding knife held almost parallel to the sides of the wood. The tongue\r\nis raised a little on both stock and scion and the two are shoved\r\ntogether. They should be securely bound with a strip of waxed cloth, and\r\na layer of wax should be spread over the whole, covering up all the cut\r\nsurfaces to the exclusion of water, air and the germs of decay.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by J. F. Jones._\r\n\r\nFIG. 25. One year Pecan in fruit. Unusual; due to bearing wood being\r\nused as a scion.]\r\n\r\nThe scion and stock are preferably chosen of nearly the same size, but\r\na scion somewhat smaller than the stock may be used, in which case the\r\ncambium layers along one side of the surfaces in contact should be\r\nplaced opposite each other, and the projecting portion of the stock\r\ntrimmed off.\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTER-CARE.\r\n\r\nIn from ten days to three weeks, the buds should unite. They should be\r\nexamined, and if union--indicated by the full, plump condition of the\r\nbuds or the commencement of growth--has taken place, the wrappings\r\nshould be removed. If growth has started, the stock should be cut off or\r\nlopped just above the insertion of the bud, in the case of budded trees.\r\nFrom time to time the trees should be examined, and all sprouts which\r\nmight rob the bud of sap, thereby preventing its growth, should be\r\nrubbed off.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[I] The term grafted, as here used, embraces budded trees as well.\r\n\r\n[J] Bulletin 30, Bureau Plant Industry, U. S. Dept. Agr., 1902.\r\n\r\n[K] Farm and Ranch, Dec. 3, 1904.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTOP-WORKING PECANS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany of the pecan trees planted in groves have not fulfilled the hopes\r\nof their planters. These trees, raised from large selected nuts, for\r\nwhich the planters paid a dollar or more per pound, have not come true\r\nto seed. Some are irregular, shy bearers; others, when they do\r\ncondescend to produce a few nuts, bear small-sized, inferior nuts, not\r\nlarger than ordinary playing marbles, while some produce a large crop of\r\ngood marketable nuts. Some are unhealthy, subject to the attacks of scab\r\nand rosette. It goes without saying that such pecan plantings are\r\nunprofitable. What is to be done with them? Briefly, this: Cut out and\r\ndestroy, root and branch, those affected by rosette, those which are\r\nunhealthy, and top-work the remainder of those which do not produce a\r\nsufficient quantity of marketable nuts of good quality.\r\n\r\nTop-working may be profitably applied to another class of trees--pecan\r\ntrees in their native woods and thickets, and in some cases hickories,\r\nviz.: Hicoria tomentosa, H. alba, and H. aquatica, may be top-worked.\r\nOur knowledge is not sufficiently advanced in regard to top-working on\r\nhickory to warrant us in making any very strong recommendations, but the\r\nauthor has seen a large number of pecans worked on hickory, a few of\r\nwhich were in bearing, and all appeared healthy and vigorous. There is\r\nno good reason why hickories cannot be top-worked to advantage, and the\r\ndelights of amateur efforts along this line will amply repay the\r\nattempt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VI. A two year top-worked Pecan tree. Variety, Van\r\nDeman.]\r\n\r\nAgain, seedling trees may be grown or purchased and set out in orchard\r\nform. When these have grown to an inch or so in diameter and have\r\ndeveloped several branches, they may be top-worked. This method of\r\nsecuring a pecan orchard is somewhat slow, and is open to the objection\r\nthat the buds or grafts frequently fail to take, and in consequence the\r\ntask of top-working extends over a number of years, resulting in trees\r\nof irregular size and shape. But by this plan a planting of desirable\r\nvarieties can be secured at little expense, and provided time is not a\r\nconsideration, the plan will prove quite satisfactory indeed.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHODS OF OPERATION.\r\n\r\nIt is best to insert both buds and grafts in parts having smooth bark,\r\nthough grafts can be placed in rough barked parts as well. Frequently\r\ntrees are in a very undesirable condition for top-working, and it should\r\nbe borne in mind that those branches nearest the center of the tree will\r\ngive the most satisfactory result in the rapid growth of buds inserted\r\nin them. If the tree is not in good shape for working--i. e., if no\r\nbranches of desirable size and age are found in convenient places--the\r\ntree should be partially trimmed to a pollard, cutting some of the main\r\nbranches back to stubs, and when shoots have started from these they may\r\nbe grafted or budded. In from six to twelve months from the time buds\r\nhave started from the branches thus cut back, under average conditions\r\nthe new shoots will have grown to sufficient size to permit of their\r\nbeing budded or grafted. The best time to prune back trees to start new\r\nshoots for top-working is early in the month of March. In removing large\r\nbranches there is always danger of splitting, because of the weight of\r\nthe heavy branches. This may be entirely obviated by sawing upward from\r\nthe under side of the branch as far as possible, then cutting from the\r\nupper side downward. A branch will split off and drop without injury to\r\nthe remaining parts. All cut surfaces should be well covered with white\r\nlead paint to prevent decay.\r\n\r\nThe method of procedure depends upon the size and age of the tree and\r\nwhether the tree is to be budded or grafted.\r\n\r\nIn top-working old trees, only a portion of the branches should be\r\nworked at one time. If the whole top be removed at once, the tree\r\nsuffers a severe shock. Two or three years are necessary to top-work a\r\nlarge tree, a half or a third of the top being worked each year. If the\r\ntrees are of small size, the whole top may be removed at one time.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARE OF TOP-WORKED TREES.\r\n\r\nFor several months after the new top has commenced to grow, the scions\r\nhave but a slight hold upon the stock. The leaf surface is often so\r\nlarge that a slight wind may twist them off. To prevent this, a number\r\nof branches may be tied together, or they may be fastened to stubs of\r\nbranches left temporarily. Posts may be driven into the ground close to\r\nthe growing scions, to which they may be tied. Use soft bandages and\r\nburlaps.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VII. An old Pecan tree Top-worked in the\r\nbranches.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nSOILS AND THEIR PREPARATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe pecan succeeds on such a wide range of soils, that it is really\r\neasier to list those on which it should not be set than it is to\r\nenumerate those on which it may be planted. Of the soils not adapted to\r\nit, deep sandy lands, soils underlaid with quicksand close to the\r\nsurface, soils with hardpan subsoil, wet, sour, poorly-drained lands,\r\nand stiff, pasty clays, may be mentioned particularly.\r\n\r\nIf pecans are planted on land with a quicksand subsoil, the roots are\r\nunable to make their way downward through the quicksand. So far as being\r\nable to take a downward direction is concerned, they might as well be\r\nplanted on top of a plate of metal. The writer once planted a few nuts\r\non such a soil, to see what they would do. At the end of three years the\r\ntops were about two feet in height; the taproot, while thick and stocky,\r\nwas not more than six inches long. It stopped abruptly after numerous\r\nefforts to penetrate the quicksand. In normally developed trees of the\r\nsame age, the taproot would have been three or four feet long. The same\r\nobjections hold against soils underlaid with a hard, impervious layer.\r\n\r\nWhile the pecan is at home on rich, alluvial river bottoms subject to\r\noverflow, yet it will not grow successfully on damp, soggy lands. It\r\nshould not be planted on such soils unless they can be well drained,\r\nand not then until they have been limed and cultivated for some time to\r\ncounteract the acidity of the land. We can definitely say that the pecan\r\nwill do well on alluvial river bottoms, on sandy, loamy soils with a\r\nclay or sandy-clay foundation, on sandy-clay lands with clay\r\npredominating, on the flat woods sandy lands so common in the\r\nsoutheastern Gulf States, and on the higher uplands where hickory,\r\ndogwood, holly and oak abound.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26. Pecan Tree grown on quicksand. Note the\r\ntaproot.]\r\n\r\nIt is a fact worthy of note, however, that on extremely rich soils, the\r\npecan will make wood growth at the expense of fruit, while on lands\r\ncontaining less fertility, less growth is developed with a\r\nproportionately large amount of fruit.\r\n\r\nChoose not the poorest soil by any means, but a good, sandy loam in\r\nwhich there is a considerable amount of humus. A subsoil containing a\r\nvery considerable amount of clay is to be preferred, by all means, for\r\nsuch a soil, with intelligent management, will gain rapidly in\r\nfertility.\r\n\r\n\r\nPREPARATION.\r\n\r\nThe preparation of the soil should be complete and thorough. It may be\r\nstated, as an axiomatic truth, that the soil cannot be prepared for\r\ntrees as well after they are planted as it can before, and nothing is to\r\nbe gained by planting the trees in poorly prepared land. Better by all\r\nmeans to spend a year or more in getting the land in shape.\r\n\r\nIf the land is covered with a growth of timber, this should be cleared\r\naway and the ground cultivated for a year at least before the trees are\r\nset. Corn is probably the best crop to grow on new land, and at the last\r\nworking cowpeas should be sowed. On fairly good land this will be\r\nsufficient, but on poorer ground the land should be continued in\r\ncultivation another year, sowing it down in beggarweed, cowpeas, soja\r\nbeans, or velvet beans. These crops should be plowed into the soil in\r\nautumn or early winter, after they are dead and dry.\r\n\r\nOn lands which have been cultivated for some time, these same crops\r\nshould be sowed for one season previous to planting, at least. Every\r\neffort should be made to insure a good stand and a good growth.\r\nInoculation of the seed with nitrogen-gathering germs will help, and a\r\ngood fertilizer, such as the one recommended for these crops elsewhere,\r\nshould be applied. Nothing will insure a good growth in the young trees\r\nso well as the nitrogen and humus added to the soil by leguminous crops.\r\nStable manure may also be used to advantage.\r\n\r\nThe ground should be deeply and thoroughly broken with a two-horse plow.\r\nIn many cases the soil conditions will be greatly improved by the use of\r\na subsoil plow, running it after the ordinary plow so as to break and\r\nloosen the soil to a depth of twelve or fifteen inches, or even more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nWHAT VARIETIES TO PLANT.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat varieties shall I plant? An easy question to ask--a difficult one\r\nto answer; for, though the one attempting a reply may know something of\r\nvarieties, their size, quality and prolificness, there is always an\r\nunknown personal equation entering into the problem.\r\n\r\nEvery variety of importance has its advocates. If a man has a preference\r\nfor a certain variety, and is interested in it, let him plant that\r\nvariety largely. He will be likely to give it better care and attention\r\nthan he will a variety for which he has no particular liking or for one\r\nwhich he may regard even with disfavor.\r\n\r\nThe question of adaptation of varieties to certain localities is an\r\nextremely important one. A variety which may do well in a certain state\r\nor region, may not succeed in another; and on the other hand, some\r\nvarieties may be grown almost anywhere. To answer questions of this\r\nsort, one must have an intimate knowledge of varieties in their local\r\nadaptations.\r\n\r\nTwo of the worst faults which a variety may have are partial barrenness\r\nor shy bearing and poor filling quality. In this last respect the worst\r\nsinners are the larger varieties, and in point of filling quality,\r\nmedium and small-sized varieties will, in nearly all cases, be found to\r\nhave the greatest range of adaptability. The larger varieties are more\r\nlikely to succeed on rich lands where the rainfall, particularly during\r\nthe summer months, is great.\r\n\r\nAgain, all varieties are not equally hardy, and some may not ripen their\r\nwood and fruit early enough in autumn to avoid late killing frosts. Such\r\nvarieties should not be selected for planting in sections where there is\r\ndanger of such injury, viz: principally along the more northerly\r\noutskirts of the pecan area. In such regions, early varieties should be\r\nplanted, for early ripening of fruit and wood usually go together in the\r\npecan.\r\n\r\nMany varieties are late in coming into bearing; others begin to bear\r\nwhile quite young. This difference in precocity is worthy of\r\nconsideration. Other things being equal, those varieties which begin to\r\nbear early and are prolific, should by all means be given the\r\npreference.\r\n\r\nIn addition to setting out an orchard of what he believes to be the best\r\nvarieties for his section, or which experience has taught to be the\r\nbest, the grower should, if he is thoroughly interested in his work,\r\nplant a tree or two of a number of other different kinds to test their\r\nmerits and to learn something of their characteristics.\r\n\r\n\r\nVARIETIES RECOMMENDED FOR DIFFERENT SECTIONS.\r\n\r\nThe following recommendations have been made by growers and others in\r\ndifferent parts of the South. These may be changed with the knowledge\r\nwhich time alone will bring; but they represent the best, most accurate\r\nand up-to-date knowledge which can be given at this time:\r\n\r\n     VIRGINIA, NORTH CAROLINA, SOUTH CAROLINA.--In these States the\r\n     different named varieties have not been grown and fruited long\r\n     enough to warrant any very strong recommendations, Pabst,\r\n     Stuart and Jewett have been planted in southeastern North\r\n     Carolina and have succeeded, but on the whole, for the entire\r\n     region of these three States, the most satisfactory and staple\r\n     progress in pecan culture will probably come from the\r\n     introduction of local varieties of merit.\r\n\r\n     GEORGIA.--Dr. J. F. Wilson, Secretary National Nut Growers'\r\n     Association, Poulan, Ga., has selected his varieties for that\r\n     section as follows: Stuart, Schley, Van Deman, Georgia and\r\n     Frotscher.\r\n\r\n     Herbert C. White, horticulturist, G. M. Bacon Pecan Co.,\r\n     DeWitt, Ga., says that Georgia and Stuart are the best of the\r\n     varieties thus far tested.\r\n\r\n     J. B. Wight, Cairo, Ga., believes in planting Frotscher\r\n     principally in his section.\r\n\r\n     FLORIDA.--Prof. H. K. Miller, Monticello, Fla., believes in\r\n     planting Schley, Dewey, Louisiana, Frotscher, Stuart, Russell,\r\n     Pabst, Van Deman and Sweetmeat.\r\n\r\n     James A. Bear, Palatka, Fla., reports that Frotscher, Stuart,\r\n     Van Deman, Curtis and Money-maker are doing well for young\r\n     trees, while Rome and Centennial have not proved satisfactory.\r\n\r\n     Dr. J. B. Curtis, Orange Heights, Fla., recommends Curtis,\r\n     Frotscher and Van Deman, these having proved most fruitful in\r\n     his orchard.\r\n\r\n     J. H. Girardeau, Monticello, Fla., regards Van Deman,\r\n     Frotscher, Pabst, Clarke and Schley as good varieties.\r\n\r\n     S. H. Graves, Gainesville, Fla., says: \"Curtis, Stuart, Van\r\n     Deman, Dalzell, Louisiana, Bolton and Frotscher are adapted\r\n     here, and have proven good fruiters. From study and observation\r\n     I would supplement this list with James, Money-maker, Success,\r\n     Russell, Robson and Schley.\"\r\n\r\n     J. F. Jones, Monticello, Fla., recommends Stuart, Van Deman,\r\n     Frotscher and Schley, emphasizing the first as a commercial\r\n     variety, and the last-named as an excellent variety for the\r\n     \"Fancy\" trade.\r\n\r\n     ALABAMA.--Prof. R. S. McIntosh, Auburn, Ala., believes Stuart,\r\n     Van Deman, Pabst, Centennial and Schley to be good varieties\r\n     for Alabama.\r\n\r\n     MISSISSIPPI.--Theo. Bechtel, Ocean Springs, Miss., says: \"My\r\n     selection at present for this section would be in the order\r\n     named--Success, Stuart, Pabst, Frotscher, Russell and Van\r\n     Deman.\"\r\n\r\n     Chas. E. Pabst, Ocean Springs, Miss., recommends Stuart, Pabst,\r\n     Russell, Success, Van Deman and Rome.\r\n\r\n     Stuart Pecan Co., Ocean Springs, Miss., recommends Stuart, Van\r\n     Deman and Russell.\r\n\r\n     Prof. H. E. Van Deman recommends Stuart, Van Deman, Money-maker\r\n     and Pabst for the Lower Mississippi Valley.\r\n\r\n     LOUISIANA.--S. H. James, Mound, La., has found Money-maker,\r\n     Stuart, Van Deman and Pabst, in the order named, best for his\r\n     section. He says that Money-maker is extremely hardy, having\r\n     withstood 20° below zero in Illinois, without injury.\r\n\r\n     Wm. Nelson, New Orleans, La., strongly recommends Frotscher and\r\n     Centennial for his section.\r\n\r\n     B. M. Young, Morgan City, La., is planting Stuart, Russell and\r\n     Young for commercial orchard.\r\n\r\n     TEXAS.--E. E. Risien, San Saba, Tex., says that San Saba is\r\n     more in demand than any other variety he has. It succeeds well\r\n     in his section. He recommends as well, Texas Prolific,\r\n     Colorado, Kincaid, Atwater, Concho and others.\r\n\r\n     E. W. Kirkpatrick, McKinney, Tex., President National\r\n     Nurserymen's Association, regards Stuart, Russell, Pabst and\r\n     Money-maker as valuable for his section. Good results have been\r\n     secured with Hollis and Wolford.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS.\r\n\r\nFrom careful observations, we believe that a list of varieties\r\ncomprising Stuart, Georgia, Money-maker, Pabst, Success, Frotscher, Van\r\nDeman and Russell of the larger sorts will be found to contain varieties\r\nwhich will prove satisfactory in most locations. To these we must add\r\nSchley, San Saba, Curtis and a number of other medium-sized or small\r\nvarieties of unsurpassed quality.\r\n\r\nWhen about to plant in a given region, study the local conditions, visit\r\nthe local trees or orchards, and upon these a conclusion may be based\r\nwhich is not likely to lead the prospective planter into very great\r\nerror.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nPURCHASING AND PLANTING PECANS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince, in most cases, the trees are to be set in late autumn and early\r\nwinter, the trees should be purchased in late summer and early autumn.\r\nDo not leave the purchasing of the trees until the last week, or the\r\nlast minute, before planting, but buy in good season, i. e., several\r\nmonths before planting time. Too many forget about the trees until the\r\ntime for setting them out has come, and not infrequently the matter is\r\nforgotten until after the season for planting is long since past.\r\n\r\nThe number of varieties in the commercial orchard should not be large.\r\nNo greater mistake can be made than that of planting a few trees each of\r\na large number of different varieties. Four or five, at most, are\r\nsufficient; got fewer varieties, rather than more.\r\n\r\nTrees can be purchased in two ways: They can be secured direct from the\r\nnurserymen (usually by catalogue), or they can be purchased from agents.\r\nBy far most of the pecan trees are bought from the nursery, and by many\r\nthis method is preferred. If trees are secured from agents, be certain\r\nthat they are responsible persons, representing responsible firms; be\r\ncertain that they are properly accredited, i. e., have certificates to\r\nshow whom they represent, and if they have not these, then send them\r\noff down the road, and the dog with them for company, if necessary. This\r\nmay seem to be harsh advice, but had it been followed by many purchasing\r\npecan trees in recent years, it would have been much to their advantage.\r\nPlenty of seedling trees have been bought and planted in the belief that\r\nthey were good grafted or budded stock.\r\n\r\nBut agents, with all sorts of credits, have represented firms which were\r\nnot honest. Budded and grafted trees of certain well-known varieties of\r\npecans have been sold, which were not those varieties.\r\n\r\nThere is every reason to believe that scions have been taken from\r\nordinary seedling trees of any kind, inserted in stocks and sold for the\r\nbest varieties, and that a large number of trees have been substituted\r\nand sold for what they were not. The prospective planter must depend\r\nupon the honesty and integrity of the nurseryman, and should inform\r\nhimself on this point.\r\n\r\nThe National Nut Growers' Association has done no greater service to the\r\npecan industry than that which they have rendered in protecting the\r\npublic from fraudulent agents and nurserymen. Happy is the nurseryman\r\nwhose reputation for square dealing merits the trust and confidence of\r\ntree-planters throughout the country.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOST OF NURSERY STOCK.\r\n\r\nAt present, the prices quoted for one and two year old stock of standard\r\nvarieties varies from 75 cents to $2.50 per tree, in small numbers, with\r\nconsiderable reduction for trees in lots of one hundred or one thousand.\r\nIt is not improbable that these prices may be somewhat reduced within\r\nthe next decade, as greater efficiency is gained in propagating.\r\n\r\n\r\nDETECTING BOGUS TREES.\r\n\r\nHow may budded or grafted trees be distinguished from ordinary seedlings\r\nor from \"doctored\" seedling trees? Many people have purchased seedling\r\ntrees at a dollar or so per tree, under the supposition that they were\r\nbudded or grafted stock. It is well to know something of the\r\ndistinctions between them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27. External and Longitudinal Interior View of Bud\r\nUnion.]\r\n\r\nIf the trunks are straight and smooth, with bark uniform in appearance\r\nthroughout, the trees have not been budded or grafted, unless the point\r\nof union is at the ground, and the trees having been grafted, and a\r\nterminal bud on graft has grown. If the young trees have been budded,\r\nthe trunks will not be straight; a bend will be seen at the point where\r\nthe bud was inserted (see Fig. 27), and the scars of the union of the\r\nveneer-shield or annular bud and the point at which the stock was cut\r\noff will be distinctly noticeable. The bark above the point of union on\r\nthe grafted or budded stocks will be different from that below. There is\r\nsomething characteristic about the color and appearance and the number,\r\nsize and shape of the lenticles of each variety of pecan, and while it\r\nis impossible to describe this difference in appearance (it can only be\r\nlearned after a large amount of experience and observation), yet the\r\nvery striking difference between the seedling stock and the wood of the\r\nvariety worked upon, will serve as a useful index to the genuineness of\r\nthe trees in question.\r\n\r\nIf the trees have been grafted instead of budded, the same statement\r\nwill be true of the appearance of the bark. But the tree will be more\r\nnearly or quite straight, and the marks and scars at the point of union\r\nwill be different. If the trees have been propagated by whip-grafting,\r\nthe scar will be shaped like the letter N, the scar on young trees\r\ncoming nearly or quite the whole distance across the stock. If the trunk\r\nof a whip-grafted tree is split through the point of union, the N-shaped\r\nmark in the form of a dark line may be distinctly made out, as shown in\r\nthe illustration. In trees propagated by cleft-grafting, the union scar\r\nwill be long, slim and V-shaped.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28. External and Longitudinal Interior View of\r\nWhip-graft Union.]\r\n\r\nBut to make the similarity between the bogus and genuine trees more\r\nstriking, the practice has been resorted to of scarring the stocks so as\r\nto make them resemble the genuine article. This we have known to be\r\ndone, more particularly in the case of budded trees. Incisions were\r\nmade in the trunks of seedling trees to resemble those made in inserting\r\na veneer-shield or an annular bud. The incisions were made so as to\r\ninclude a bud, and the top of the seedling tree was then cut off just\r\nabove the bud. A tree doctored in this way makes a very close imitation\r\nof the real article, and the buyer needs to be on his guard. But the\r\nappearance of the bark, as already noted, will serve as a guide. If in\r\ndoubt, it may be well to sacrifice a few trees and cut them carefully\r\nopen down to the pith just through the point of union. _If the trees\r\nhave been doctored, the tissues of the wood and the pith will be\r\ncontinuous; but, if the trees are genuinely budded or grafted, the\r\ntissues and pith will not be continuous._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29. Annular bud growing (left). Split through same\r\nunion (center). A normal branch union (right). Pith non-continuous\r\n(center); continuous (right).]\r\n\r\nFinally, if still in doubt, send two or three trees to the botanist or\r\nhorticulturist of the Experiment Station of your State, and ask his\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANTING PECAN TREES.\r\n\r\nToo often but slight attention is given to this important piece of work.\r\nThere is too frequently a disposition on the part of the person setting\r\ntrees of any kind to do the work as rapidly as possible without\r\nconsideration for the future welfare of the trees. Few realize that time\r\nspent in careful, intelligent preparation of the soil and in setting the\r\ntrees is time well spent, and well paid for in the after development of\r\ntrunk and branch. Better a month spent in preparing the future home of\r\nthe young tree, than years of its life spent in an unequal struggle for\r\nexistence. More than that, the tree may die outright, and a year must\r\nelapse before it can be replaced. It is generally stated that the pecan\r\nis a slow grower, and yet I have seen trees from twelve to fourteen\r\nyears old which measured from thirty-five to fifty-seven inches in\r\ncircumference at the base, while under less favorable circumstances\r\nothers stood still for a period of six or seven years, or until they had\r\naccumulated sufficient energy to overcome the untoward conditions of\r\ntheir environments.\r\n\r\n     _Time._ The best time to plant pecan trees is during the months\r\n     of December, January and February. Planting should not be\r\n     delayed until late in spring, as the percentage of loss will be\r\n     very materially increased. Preference must be given to the\r\n     earlier portion of the planting season, as the wounds on the\r\n     roots will have had time to callous over, and the ground will\r\n     be firmly packed about the roots by the winter rains. Then,\r\n     with the opening of the growing season in spring, the trees\r\n     will be ready to make a good, vigorous start.\r\n\r\n     _Distance Apart._ The distance apart at which the pecan trees\r\n     should be set must depend upon the character of the soil and\r\n     the amount of fertility and moisture it contains. If planted\r\n     too close, the trees may become their own worst enemies. Too\r\n     close planting will not prove satisfactory. It is doubtful\r\n     whether the trees should ever be planted closer than forty feet\r\n     apart even on light lands, while on heavier soils this distance\r\n     should be increased to sixty, seventy-five or eighty feet.\r\n\r\n     TABLE OF DISTANCES\r\n\r\n       DISTANCE.

The result will be the number\r\n     of trees which can be put on an acre of ground.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANTING SYSTEMS.\r\n\r\nFor setting orchards a number of different systems may be used, but the\r\ntwo best adapted to the pecan orchard, are the square or rectangular and\r\nthe hexagonal or septuple. If mixed plantings, such as pecans and\r\npeaches, are to be made, then the quincunx system should be used and a\r\npeach tree set in the center of the square or rectangle formed by every\r\nfour pecan trees.\r\n\r\n     _Square or Rectangular System._ In this system is included only\r\n     the methods of setting trees in rectangles, either square or\r\n     oblong. It is by far the most commonly used of all the systems,\r\n     and the ease with which a field can be laid off in rectangles,\r\n     is greatly in its favor.\r\n\r\n     The rows of trees intersect each other at right angles, and\r\n     cultivation may be carried on conveniently either crosswise or\r\n     lengthwise of the orchard. The planter has the choice of\r\n     placing the trees the same distance apart both ways, or of\r\n     planting them closer together in the rows than the distance\r\n     between the rows.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30. Rectangular Planting System.]\r\n\r\n     It has been argued that space is not equally divided among the\r\n     trees, and while this is apparently true, yet, on the other\r\n     hand, the roots of pecan trees, in most cases, penetrate and\r\n     permeate all the space allowed in ordinary distances. The roots\r\n     will certainly secure all the food and moisture in the top two\r\n     or three feet of soil.\r\n\r\n     When trees are to be planted by this system, the stakes must be\r\n     set so as to be exactly in line, whether viewed from the end or\r\n     from the side of the field.\r\n\r\n     _Hexagonal, Septuple or Equilateral Triangle System._ By this\r\n     system, six trees are set equidistant from a seventh placed in\r\n     the center. The basis of the system is not the square, but the\r\n     circle, since the radius of the circle is approximately equal\r\n     to one-sixth of the circumference of the circle. The name\r\n     septuple, sometimes applied to this system, refers to the fact\r\n     that the number of trees in each group-unit is seven.\r\n     Equilateral triangle system refers to the planting of the trees\r\n     in equilateral triangles, but is identical with the hexagonal\r\n     or septuple.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31. Hexagonal Planting System.]\r\n\r\n     It is the only system whereby each tree is placed equally\r\n     distant from each of its adjoining neighbors, and the only\r\n     system which equally divides the space among the trees. By this\r\n     method about fifteen per cent. more trees can be set per acre\r\n     than by the rectangular.\r\n\r\n     For permanent plantings, at regular distances, this system and\r\n     the rectangular should be recommended before other systems.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAYING OUT BEFORE PLANTING.\r\n\r\nLevel and smooth the ground, harrow and pulverize thoroughly, then\r\nproceed to stake the ground off, placing a stake for every tree.\r\n\r\n     _Laying Out Squares or Rectangles with the Plow._ If a good\r\n     plowman can be secured, very satisfactory work can be done with\r\n     the plow. In some cases a man can be found who needs nothing in\r\n     the way of a guide, except two or three stakes. But with a\r\n     sufficient number of stakes and a marker attached to the plow,\r\n     good results can be secured by almost any plowman.\r\n\r\n     Furrows should be run both lengthwise and crosswise of the\r\n     field, their intersections marking the place where the trees\r\n     are to stand. At each one set a stake.\r\n\r\n     It is essential that a true, square corner should be secured.\r\n     This may be done by sighting with an ordinary carpenter's\r\n     square set upon three posts.\r\n\r\n     _Laying Out in Rectangles with a Wire._ A wire, long enough to\r\n     reach down one side of the field, should be provided. Stretch\r\n     this straight out between two posts and mark off the distance\r\n     which the trees are to stand apart, upon it. At each point\r\n     marked, firmly twist a piece of small wire about the larger\r\n     one. These should then be soldered in place. It will not do to\r\n     have them shift. This wire may be rolled upon a roller when not\r\n     in use.\r\n\r\n     Measure off along both ends of the field and set small stakes\r\n     on the tree rows, at the marked places on the wire. Tightly\r\n     stretch the wire down the first tree row, attaching it firmly\r\n     at the ground level to a pair of good, stout posts. Then plant\r\n     a lath stake at each mark on the wire. Set all of them on the\r\n     outside of the wire, so as not to interfere with moving it.\r\n     When this row in completed, lift the end stake with the wire\r\n     attached, stretch on the second row, set the stakes as before\r\n     and repeat the operations until the work is completed.\r\n\r\n     _Laying Out in Hexagons._ Stretch the wire down one side of the\r\n     field and firmly set the tree stakes, or stake out the base\r\n     line by any method, firmly setting a stake for each tree. Then\r\n     procure two pieces of wire with rings at each end, the length\r\n     of each wire and ring to be exactly the distance between the\r\n     stakes as set on the base line. Stretch these wires out toward\r\n     the side where the next tree row is to stand. At the point\r\n     where the rings overlap set a stake for a tree. Remove wire\r\n     number one and set it on the third stake in the base line,\r\n     stretch the two tight and set a tree stake. Repeat as often as\r\n     necessary. In setting the third row of stakes, use the second\r\n     as a base line, and so on.\r\n\r\n     _Planting the Trees._ After setting a stake for each tree, the\r\n     ground is ready for digging the holes and setting the trees. A\r\n     planting board, such as is shown in the accompanying\r\n     illustration, should be provided. It is made of a piece of inch\r\n     board, four or five inches wide and five feet long. The ends\r\n     may be notched or holes may be bored in them. In the center of\r\n     one side, a notch, one and a half inches deep, should be cut.\r\n     Provide a large number of small wooden pins or sticks, about\r\n     one foot long and well sharpened.\r\n\r\n     When ready to dig a hole, place the planting-board so that the\r\n     notch in the side fits against the tree stake. Then place one\r\n     of the small pins in each of the holes or notches at the ends\r\n     of the board. Allow these to remain in the ground. Remove the\r\n     board and the tree stake and dig the hole.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32. Planting-Board.]\r\n\r\n     The hole should preferably be dug just before setting the tree.\r\n     In some cases, however, it may be necessary to have all the\r\n     holes dug in advance. Make them wide and deep, six or eight\r\n     inches wider than the extended lateral roots and eight inches\r\n     deeper than the length of the taproot.\r\n\r\n     In setting the tree, place the planting-board back on the pegs\r\n     and place the tree at the right depth, against the notch in the\r\n     side. It will then stand exactly where a stake stood, and if\r\n     the stakes were in line, the trees will be also, if they are\r\n     kept perpendicular while the earth is being filled in. The\r\n     earth should be packed about the roots by hand, the tree being\r\n     set no deeper than it stood in the nursery.\r\n\r\n     To start the trees off well, one pound to one pound and a half\r\n     of a good fertilizer, analyzing about six per cent. potash,\r\n     five per cent. phosphoric acid and four per cent. nitrogen,\r\n     should be thoroughly mixed with the earth that is used in\r\n     filling in the hole. Preferably, only surface soil should be\r\n     used to place about the roots.\r\n\r\n     When the hole is filled in about three-fourths, water may be\r\n     applied to advantage, particularly if the weather is dry. A\r\n     good application should be given after the work is completed,\r\n     so as to establish the capillary movement of the water in the\r\n     soil.\r\n\r\n     The greatest care should be taken to prevent the roots from\r\n     becoming dry, if they do, the chances of their living, after\r\n     planting, are very greatly reduced.\r\n\r\n     From the time the trees are lifted from the nursery row until\r\n     they are set in the orchard, the sun should never be allowed to\r\n     shine on them. Neither should they be exposed to hot or drying\r\n     winds. Should it happen that the trees are received before\r\n     everything is ready for planting them, they should be unpacked\r\n     and healed in, in a shady place.\r\n\r\n     The roots of the trees must be pruned before planting, but this\r\n     should be done under a shed. All broken parts of roots should\r\n     be carefully cut off, leaving good, smooth surfaces, and the\r\n     taproot cut or pruned back, as described in the chapter on\r\n     pruning. When the pruning is finished, _the trees should be\r\n     wrapped in a damp blanket or in damp sacks and taken to the\r\n     field_. When needed for planting, they should be removed one by\r\n     one and set out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nCULTIVATION AND FERTILIZATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nToo many of our ideas of fruit culture are borrowed from the woods, from\r\nthe trees in the pasture lands and uncultivated places generally. As the\r\npecan is a forest tree in many sections of the country, the inference\r\nis, that it needs no cultivation, no fertilizer, in short, is amply able\r\nto take care of itself. So it is, but not able to yield, at the same\r\ntime, the large crops of nuts that are the object of its being planted.\r\n\r\nFrom the woods, there is one lesson which it would be well for everyone\r\nto learn; a lesson, not of the trees, but of the soil, of the dense mass\r\nof mold, of partially decayed leaves, of vegetable matter, of humus that\r\ncovers the forest floor. The soil in the pecan orchard needs humus,\r\nvegetable matter; so does the soil in any other kind of orchard, and to\r\nobtain results it must be provided.\r\n\r\nNow, it is a well-known fact that a number of years (ten or twelve) must\r\nelapse before a pecan orchard will begin to give any adequate returns\r\nfor the time and care bestowed upon it and the money invested in it.\r\nDuring this period, if rightly handled, the ground may be made to\r\nproduce something else than pecan trees, and that, too, without injury\r\nto them. But in growing a crop in the orchard, bear in mind that the\r\ntrees need, and are benefited by, cultivation, and that fertilizer will\r\nmake them grow.\r\n\r\nBut, as already noted, humus is needed, and since this is the case, corn\r\nor cotton or clean-culture crops, which leave little behind them to make\r\nhumus after they are removed, should not be grown every year. Some of\r\nthe legumes should be brought in. Cowpeas, soja beans, beggarweed,\r\nvelvet beans, alfalfa and melilotus can all be grown in the pecan area.\r\nNot all of them in every locality, but some one or more of them in every\r\nsection. To keep up the supply of vegetable matter, grow one of these\r\nleguminous crops every two or three years, or oftener, and after they\r\nhave died and dried on the surface, plow them into the soil. And when\r\ncorn is grown, sow cowpeas at the last working of the crop, to enrich\r\nthe soil. These legumes will add nitrogen to the soil and help to reduce\r\nthe fertilizer bills, for nitrogen is the costliest of all the\r\nfertilizer materials which we buy.\r\n\r\nSometimes, it will not do to crop the orchard. A condition may have to\r\nbe met, in which there is not enough water to supply both the trees and\r\nthe growing crops and one or the other will suffer--the trees, usually.\r\nIn such a case the advisability of cropping is questionable unless, of\r\ncourse, water in sufficient quantity can be supplied by irrigation.\r\n\r\nSmall grains, oats, wheat, etc., should be rigidly excluded. When corn\r\nor cotton is planted, leave out a row or two of the crops where the tree\r\nrow is. Let the trees have feeding space, but cultivate all the ground.\r\n\r\nIf the season is dry, then give cultivation just as often as can be\r\ndone. Every week or ten days, between the first of April and the first\r\nor middle of July, the ground should be stirred in young orchards.\r\nShallow cultivation is all that is necessary after the first plowing. A\r\nweeder or light harrow will do the work. This shallow cultivation will\r\npreserve a dust mulch, a couple of inches or so in depth, and the loss\r\nof soil moisture by capillary action and evaporation will thereby be\r\nprevented; more moisture will be retained in the soil and the trees will\r\nbe benefited accordingly.\r\n\r\nWhether the orchard is planted in a crop or not, cultivation should\r\nbegin about the time growth starts in spring. The ground should be\r\nplowed and leveled with a cultivator. After that, frequent shallow\r\ncultivation should be given with a light harrow or weeder. Once every\r\nweek or ten days, if the weather is dry, will result in much good to the\r\ntrees. If a shower should fall during one of these dry periods, the\r\nground should be cultivated just as soon as it can be worked. A light\r\nharrow, which will break up the surface crust formed by the rain and\r\nleave instead a shallow mulch of pulverized soil, will go a long way\r\ntoward conserving and holding the water which has been added by the\r\nrecent rainfall.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of old orchards may vary somewhat from that given\r\nyounger ones. Some recommend that the old orchard be seeded to grass\r\n(Bermuda or Johnson grass) and used as a pasture. This may answer in\r\nsome cases, particularly on very rich, alluvial soils, but, in general,\r\nit will not do as a definite policy year in and year out. Those orchards\r\nplanted in grass which the author has had an opportunity to examine,\r\nhave usually shown a large percentage of trees with branches dead at the\r\ntips, \"stagheaded,\" with yellow leaves and a general appearance of\r\nunthriftiness. It may have been that these orchards were planted in\r\ngrass while the trees were too young. The better treatment, and the\r\nsafer one to follow in old orchards, is to cultivate the ground in\r\nspring and sow down in cowpeas or some other legume. Beggarweed, velvet\r\nbeans or soja beans will answer well in many localities. Allow these to\r\nmake what growth they will, and, when dead and dry, plow them back into\r\nthe soil. It may seem strange to cultivate a forest tree, but it is the\r\nplan to follow to get results. Good results could doubtless be secured\r\nby seeding the pecan orchard in alfalfa and using it for a hog pasture\r\nup to the ripening season.\r\n\r\nCultivation should not be prolonged too late. If it be, the trees will\r\ncontinue to grow later than they should. Enough time will not be left in\r\nmany sections before the coming of the first frosts. If the immature,\r\nsappy wood is caught by an early frost, severe injury may result. In the\r\nmore southern extension of the pecan area cultivation can be carried on\r\nlater than toward the northern limits of the region. Ordinarily, it is\r\nsafest to cease cultivation not later than July the first to July the\r\nfifteenth.\r\n\r\n\r\nFERTILIZATION.\r\n\r\nOn deep rich, alluvial soils the trees may not need to be fertilized,\r\nbut many of the soils on which pecans have been set in orchard form,\r\nrequire to be fertilized to secure the best results. The three important\r\nplant foods required by plants and most frequently deficient in soils\r\nare nitrogen, phosphorus and potash. One or two or all three of these\r\nsubstances may have to be supplied.\r\n\r\nNitrogen, which is used by the trees largely in making growth of leaf\r\nand wood, may be supplied from a number of different sources, viz:\r\nstable manure, cotton seed, cotton-seed meal, dried blood, fish scrap,\r\nsulphate of ammonia and nitrate of soda. These substances are the\r\nprincipal commercial sources of nitrogen. Large amounts of nitrogen are\r\ngathered by leguminous crops; cowpeas, vetch, beggarweed, velvet beans,\r\nalfalfa and others may be planted to advantage, resulting in a great\r\nsaving in fertilizer bills, and besides, adding the necessary vegetable\r\nmatter and humus.\r\n\r\nThe most common source of phosphorus, usually referred to as phosphoric\r\nacid, is acid phosphate. Some is obtained from bone, and bone meal is a\r\ngood fertilizer to use among pecan trees. The results obtained from its\r\nuse are not immediate, but since the bone does not decay rapidly, they\r\nextend over a considerable period. On the whole, acid phosphate is as\r\nsatisfactory as any material as a source of phosphoric acid, and the\r\ngoods with the highest percentage are usually the most economical in the\r\nend. A good grade is that analyzing fourteen per cent.\r\n\r\nPotash may be purchased, as kainit, the raw salt, or as muriate of\r\npotash, low grade sulphate of potash and high grade sulphate of potash.\r\nOf these the sulphates are usually given the preference in fruit\r\ngrowing. Of the domestic sources of potash, woodashes are important.\r\n\r\nThe amount of fertilizer which it is best to apply is difficult to\r\ndecide upon; much depends on the character of the soil, what crops are\r\ncultivated and whether a crop of legumes is grown or not.\r\n\r\nIf legumes are grown for the benefit of the orchard, they should be\r\nfertilized, and if the crop is turned back into the soil, this may be\r\nsufficient for the trees, particularly while they are young. For the\r\nlegumes, a good fertilizer to use per acre is:\r\n\r\n         Kainit, 100 lbs.; Acid Phosphate, 200 lbs.\r\n\r\n     or, High-Grade Sulphate of Potash, 50 lbs.\r\n         Acid Phosphate, 200 lbs.\r\n\r\nIn any case some allowance should be made for the amount of nitrogen\r\ncollected by the legumes. When corn, cotton or some other crops are\r\ngrown in the orchard, fertilizing may simply consist in distributing an\r\nadditional amount of the crop fertilizer for the benefit of the trees.\r\n\r\nFor the growth of the young trees, a larger amount of nitrogen and a\r\nrelatively smaller amount of phosphoric acid and potash are required,\r\nwhile for older trees, the reverse is true. Phosphoric acid and potash\r\nare required by bearing trees for the formation of fruit. Consequently,\r\nwhen the pecan orchard comes into bearing, these materials should be\r\nincreased in the fertilizer applied. If the soil is not very rich at the\r\ntime of planting, good results will follow the use of a pound of good\r\ncommercial fertilizer at the time of planting.\r\n\r\nA good fertilizer for young trees should analyze five per cent.\r\nphosphoric acid, six per cent. potash and four per cent. nitrogen. For\r\nbearing trees, one analyzing eight per cent. phosphoric acid, ten per\r\ncent. potash and four per cent. nitrogen will give good results. If so\r\ndesired, well-known brands of commercial fertilizers, having\r\napproximately the above analysis, can be purchased in the markets, but\r\nif preferred, the several materials may be purchased separately, then\r\nmixed and applied.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPLYING THE FERTILIZER.\r\n\r\nThe roots of young trees do not extend to any great distance away from\r\nthe trunk. In distributing the fertilizer this fact should be\r\nremembered. A safe rule for all small-sized trees is to commence just\r\noutside an imaginary circle of two feet radius and apply the fertilizer\r\nin a circular band extending out some distance beyond the spread of the\r\nbranches. Old trees, or those having a considerable spread of top, when\r\nplanted in orchard form, should be fertilized by broadcasting the\r\nfertilizer over the ground. In the northerly pecan sections, all the\r\nfertilizer should be given in one application, about the time growth\r\nstarts in spring, and plowed in, while farther south, two applications\r\nmay be made, one at the time mentioned above, the other from the first\r\nto the middle of June.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nPRUNING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe pruning of the pecan is neither difficult nor complicated. In short,\r\nafter the top of the tree is well started, little need be done except to\r\ncut back a branch here and there that the trees may develop\r\nwell-rounded, symmetrical tops. A splendid type of tree is shown in\r\nPlate VI.\r\n\r\n\r\nHIGH VS. LOW-HEADED TREES.\r\n\r\nFrequently trees are so pruned that their first branches are eight or\r\nten feet from the ground. Even young trees are pruned to slim stems,\r\nsurmounted by a small umbrella-like top. Such trees frequently have to\r\nbe tied to a post to keep them upright until such time as they attain\r\nsufficient size to support themselves. Such pruning should not be\r\ncountenanced. The trees will make a much more rapid and satisfactory\r\ngrowth, and their trunks will be less affected by the hot sun, if the\r\nbranches are allowed to develop lower down. Sometimes the system of\r\npruning pecans with tall, bare trunks is adopted to allow of crops being\r\ngrown under the trees, or because it is desired to use the ground as a\r\ncattle pasture. These considerations should not weigh against the\r\nwelfare of the trees. As much ground can be cropped around low-headed\r\ntrees as is good for them, and, in brief, the cows should be pastured\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nOrdinarily the top of the tree should be so shaped that the lower\r\nbranches will be about four feet from the ground. The trunk will be\r\nshaded and protected, the crop will be nearer the ground, and the low\r\ntops will be less subject to the destructive force of heavy winds, so\r\ninjurious to both fruit and branches.\r\n\r\nTo start the trees at four feet, the tops must be cut back to that\r\nheight at the time the trees are set, or, if smaller, when they have\r\ngrown to that height. Three or four buds nearest the top should then be\r\nallowed to develop and form the main framework of the tree. After this\r\nthe trees will need little or no pruning, except the cutting back of\r\nstraggling branches, and the removal of dead or broken ones.\r\n\r\nSome writers have advised the persistent and severe cutting back of the\r\ntops, from time to time, so as to keep them small, compact and low, but\r\nsuch a system of pruning must be put into practice on a considerable\r\nscale for a number of years before it can be recommended. Such a plan\r\nmight prove valuable where the trees are subject to the force of strong\r\nwinds, but otherwise it is of doubtful value.\r\n\r\n\r\nTIME TO PRUNE.\r\n\r\nPruning may be done at any convenient time, but the best period is\r\nprobably either just before the flow of sap in spring, or just after the\r\ntrees have fully developed their leaves in spring. Following the removal\r\nof branches of any considerable size--three-quarters of an inch and\r\nupward--the wounds should be carefully painted over with white lead\r\npaint to prevent decay.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARE OF BROKEN TREES.\r\n\r\nWhen trees are broken or injured by wind-storms, the broken branches\r\nshould be cut off and the resulting wounds carefully trimmed and\r\npainted. If the branches are only partly split off, the injury may be\r\nrepaired, in many cases, by pressing the branch back into place and\r\nbolting it there, so as to hold it firmly in place. Trees with forked\r\ntrunks should be protected by passing a bolt through the two branches\r\nsome distance above where they divide to prevent splitting.\r\n\r\n\r\nNURSERY ROOT-PRUNING.\r\n\r\nToo frequently the root system of pecan trees, intended for planting, is\r\nbut poorly developed. The root consists almost entirely of one large\r\ntaproot destitute of laterals. Such trees are slow in starting and are\r\nhard to transplant. Figure 33 shows an excellent root system on a\r\nnursery tree. Such a tree should be almost as easily transplanted as an\r\napple tree. A little more care on the part of nurserymen would insure\r\ngood root systems.\r\n\r\nIn a former publication it was suggested that the young seedlings\r\nintended for stocks be root-pruned \"in the fall, after the trees are one\r\nyear old. It could easily be accomplished by running the tree-digger\r\ndown the row at a depth of nine or ten inches. The taproots could thus\r\nbe severed, and the following spring, or summer, the trees could be\r\nworked (budded or grafted). This course of treatment would insure\r\ngreater success in transplanting, as it would have a tendency to develop\r\nthe lateral roots; and in addition to that, it would, in all\r\nprobability, induce earlier fruiting.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nROOT TRIMMING BEFORE PLANTING.\r\n\r\nTwo year old taproots should be cut to eighteen or twenty-four inches;\r\nlarger ones, in proportion. The old idea that transplanted pecan trees,\r\nthe taproots of which have been cut back, will not live and bear, is not\r\nborne out by experience. They are in no-wise injured by its partial\r\nremoval, and it might all be removed were it not that so many would die\r\nin transplanting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 33. A nursery tree with a good root system.]\r\n\r\nFigure 34 shows two pecan trees at two years. The one on the right was\r\ncarefully lifted so as to preserve as much as possible of the taproot,\r\nwhile the one on the left had the taproot cut when it was transplanted\r\nat one year. In the latter, six small roots from four and one-half to\r\neight inches in length had grown out to replace the taproot, these\r\ndoubtless having supplied the tree with as much nourishment as would\r\nhave been given by its single taproot. Furthermore, without doubt, one\r\nof these roots would have grown so as to replace the taproot.\r\n\r\nThe advice has been given to cut the taproots back to five or six\r\ninches, but under general average climatic conditions throughout the\r\npecan region anyone who follows this advice will have reason to regret\r\nit. Our experience in transplanting pecan trees has been such as to\r\nindicate the necessity of having a well-branched, well-developed root\r\nsystem, and a taproot, when present, should be left at least as long as\r\nindicated above.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34. a. Taproot cut at 1 yr. b. Taproot not cut.]\r\n\r\nA long taproot is objectionable on account of the additional cost and\r\nlabor entailed in digging holes of sufficient depth for planting. To\r\nshorten the length of the taproot, Mr. E. E. Risien, of San Saba, Tex.,\r\nhas patented a method which has given satisfactory results. The nuts\r\nfrom which the stocks are grown are planted over strips of mosquito\r\nnetting, the netting being some distance below the level of the nuts.\r\nWhen the taproots have penetrated to the netting, their growth is\r\nstopped, and the lateral roots develop better in consequence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART IV.\r\n\r\nHarvesting. Marketing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nGATHERING, STORING AND MARKETING PECANS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile, in preparing a crop of pecan nuts for market, such extreme care\r\nneed not be exercised as in handling a crop of peaches, plums or\r\noranges, still there are a number of details which require careful\r\nattention to secure the best results. Careful attention to these few\r\npoints is quite as necessary as in handling any other fruit crop, though\r\nit might appear otherwise.\r\n\r\n_Time to Gather._ As a rule the bulk of the nut crop must be disposed of\r\nbefore Thanksgiving, and there is in consequence a strong disposition to\r\ngather the crop anyway, whether ready or not. Much might be said on both\r\nsides of the question, but in general it must be granted that gathering\r\nthe crop while still somewhat immature, and beating the trees to cause\r\nthe nuts to drop, cannot be commended.\r\n\r\nWhen the great majority of nut husks are open, the crop of the tree is\r\nready to be harvested. It will not do to wait until every burr is open\r\n(some varieties never open, but such are extremely undesirable), for it\r\nwill usually be found that by far the most of those which do not open,\r\non trees which open their burrs uniformly, are faulty, and it will not\r\npay to wait for them. Neither should such be left on the tree, but the\r\nwhole tree should be stripped at the time already indicated. It will be\r\nnecessary to use light bamboo poles to remove the nuts with closed\r\nburrs.\r\n\r\n_Picking._ The nuts must either be picked by hand or knocked off the\r\ntrees onto the ground with sticks. From whatever standpoint we may\r\nregard the gathering of the crops, in orchards of good varieties, the\r\nbest plan for the removal of the nuts is to take them off, in so far as\r\npossible, by hand. Men should climb the trees and collect the nuts in\r\nsacks. Men provided with sacks can, with the help of a good extension\r\nladder, reach the most of the nuts on ordinary trees, up to forty or\r\nfifty feet in height. A good man will pick one hundred pounds of the\r\nshelled nuts in a day, at a cost of one dollar--or one cent per pound.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 35. After the Harvest.]\r\n\r\nIn gathering the crop, the product of each individual tree, in the case\r\nof heavy-bearing seedlings, or of each group of trees of a single\r\nvariety of grafted trees, should be kept in a single pile or lot. It\r\nwill not do to mix nuts of different sizes, shapes and colors, if the\r\nbest price is to be hoped for.\r\n\r\n_Curing._ As soon as removed from the trees the nuts should be carried\r\nto the curing house. This house should be absolutely rat-proof. Here\r\nthey are to be picked from the hulls, the unopened burrs being placed\r\napart by themselves. If they open later, well and good; some good nuts\r\nmay be found among them, but usually they are inferior and should be\r\nkept strictly apart from the other portion of the crop. The cost of\r\nremoving a hundred pounds of nuts from the hulls is about fifty cents.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the nuts have been separated from the hulls, they should be\r\nspread out in shallow trays for curing. These trays should be two and\r\none-half or three feet wide and four or five inches deep. The bottoms\r\nare best covered with wire netting with meshes about one-half inch\r\nsquare. They may be arranged around the walls of the curing room, one\r\ntier above another. The room should be provided with good ventilation so\r\nas to give a free circulation of air. In the trays the nuts may be\r\nplaced two or three layers deep; if placed too deep there is danger of\r\ntheir moulding. They should be turned over from time to time, and, under\r\naverage conditions, two weeks will be sufficient to cure them\r\nthoroughly.\r\n\r\n_Grading._ Before packing for market, the nuts should be carefully\r\ngraded. Too much attention cannot be given to this detail. Rigid grading\r\npays--it pays handsomely, and the more abundant the supply, the better\r\nit pays.\r\n\r\nIt will not do to mix together nuts of all sizes, shapes, and\r\ncolors--some small, some large, some pointed, some blunt, some dark,\r\nsome light, some streaked, and then expect to get the full value of the\r\ncrop. It cannot be done with a good grade of pecans.\r\n\r\nPerhaps in no kind of fruit which is placed on the market can a more\r\nnearly absolutely uniform grade be made (see Frontispiece). The variety\r\nshould be the basis of the grade. In gathering the crop, each variety\r\nshould be put by itself as it is gathered. In most varieties the size is\r\nquite uniform, and little else need be done; but if there is any\r\nconsiderable variation in size, the small ones should be removed from\r\nthe first grade of nuts.\r\n\r\nPolishing and staining should not be done. It is always best to let each\r\nvariety retain its own individual marks and characteristics. These are a\r\npart of the market quality of the variety and should, by all means, be\r\nretained. Mixed lots of seedling nuts may be polished to render them\r\nmore uniform, but the staining is an abomination, though some people\r\nwould rather have it, not knowing, perhaps, what a pecan looks like\r\nwithout it.\r\n\r\n_Shipping Packages._ The package should be strong and light, and should\r\nafford ample protection to the product. We have known pecans to be\r\nshipped by mail, freight or express, in bags, and losses have occurred.\r\nBarrels for larger shipments, and wooden boxes for smaller ones are\r\nbest, and afford the necessary protection. Gift packages, holding ten or\r\ntwenty pounds or even more, should be made of half inch stuff at least,\r\nwith ends three-quarters or one inch thick. Grocery boxes may be cut up,\r\nplaned off, and made over. In all cases the packages should be neat and\r\nclean, and in perfect keeping with the contents. The name and address of\r\nthe grower, the name of the variety, and the number of pounds should be\r\nneatly stamped on the outside.\r\n\r\n_Marketing._ As it is at present, so will it be for many years to come,\r\nstrictly first-class pecans will be handled almost entirely by or\r\nthrough a private trade. We know of several growers who dispose of their\r\ncrops of several thousand pounds annually to private customers who have\r\nlearned the value of good nuts. So greatly has the demand increased that\r\nin no single instance is anyone of these men able to supply the demand\r\nof the natural outgrowth of his own work, and orders are usually booked\r\na year or more in advance. This is the ideal method of handling the\r\ncrop, and the one method which enables the grower to secure the best\r\nprice for his product.\r\n\r\nIn building up such a private trade, advertising must be resorted to,\r\neither through the newspapers, magazines and other channels, or by\r\ndistributing samples of nuts. \"Once a customer, always a customer\"\r\nshould be the motto for the grower to hold in mind, and every effort\r\nshould be made and every precaution taken to _see that the nuts, from\r\nyear to year, are absolutely uniform in size, shape, and quality_. Do\r\nnot send a customer one size, shape, or quality one year, at a certain\r\nprice, and the next year vary it. Such treatment will tend to make\r\ncustomers dissatisfied, and the grower may lose them entirely. This\r\npoint cannot be too strongly emphasized.\r\n\r\nStrictly first-class nuts may be disposed of to advantage to the\r\nfirst-class grocery or fruit trade in the larger cities. In cities of\r\nany considerable size, there will always be found a grocer or fruiter\r\nwho is willing to take a first-class article at a price considerably\r\nabove the usual market price of ordinary nuts. The writer once submitted\r\nsamples of nuts of medium, but uniform size and good quality, to a\r\ngrocery firm in New York. They replied that they would take nuts like\r\nthe samples at twelve and a half to fifteen cents a pound in carload\r\nlots, when the common run of pecans could be purchased at four or five\r\ncents per pound.\r\n\r\nAs the output of high-grade pecans is increased, they may be disposed of\r\nthrough the usual nut trade channels--the commission men. The bulk of\r\nthe product in the country to-day is handled by commission men, either\r\nbeing purchased direct or sold on consignment. If sold for cash in the\r\nhome market, well and good, but if sold on consignment, choose one\r\nreliable commission house in each city in which the product is to be\r\nmarketed--never two in the same city--and ship to it right along.\r\n\r\n_Storing._ During the cold weather following the gathering of the crop,\r\nlittle or no change takes place in the flavor of the kernels. During the\r\nheat of summer, however, they deteriorate. The natural amount of\r\nmoisture in them is reduced, the air enters, oxidation takes place and\r\nthe flavor becomes rancid.\r\n\r\nThese changes can be prevented if the nuts are kept in cold storage, say\r\nat a temperature of from thirty-five to forty degrees. When nuts are\r\nkept in the house, they should be stored in the coolest possible place,\r\nin sealed jars or tight boxes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART V.\r\n\r\nDiseases. Insects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nFUNGOUS AND OTHER DISEASES OF THE PECAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fungous diseases attacking the pecan have not been thoroughly\r\ninvestigated. They have not, however, become so numerous or common as to\r\ncause serious damage except in a few instances. The true fungous\r\ndiseases are usually propagated and disseminated by means of spores, and\r\nthe most effectual method of control usually consists in spraying with\r\nBordeaux mixture or some other fungicide. For all fungous diseases of\r\nthe pecan which may be controlled by spraying no substance will give\r\nbetter results than Bordeaux mixture, and directions for preparing it\r\nare given at the end of this chapter. Paris green, at the rate of four\r\nounces to each fifty gallons of liquid, may be added to the mixture for\r\nthe destruction of biting insects. For effectual work in spraying large\r\ntrees, a platform should be erected on the wagon-bed to make it possible\r\nto reach the tops with the spray.\r\n\r\n     PECAN LEAF BLIGHT (_Cercospora Halstedii_): This disease of\r\n     pecan leaves causes them to turn brown, wither up and drop\r\n     prematurely. At first, small brown spots are noted. These\r\n     become larger, and at length the whole leaf is destroyed. When\r\n     attacked by this disease the tree makes no progress. An\r\n     examination of the discolored areas, under a microscope, shows\r\n     the presence of tuft-like growths of spores upon short\r\n     conidiophores. As they become matured the spores are scattered\r\n     by the rain or wind and so the disease is spread. It probably\r\n     lives over from one season to another on the diseased leaves.\r\n\r\n     The most effective remedy is to spray thoroughly three times\r\n     with Bordeaux mixture. The first application should be given\r\n     just when the young leaves are expanding, followed by two\r\n     others at intervals of two or three weeks. The fallen leaves\r\n     should, if feasible, be gathered and burned.\r\n\r\n     Pecan Scab (_Fusicladium effusum_): This disease attacks the\r\n     fruit, leaves and twigs. The husks of the diseased nuts become\r\n     covered with dark spots or specks. They become hardened and\r\n     crack open in places. As a result of the attack, growth is\r\n     stopped, the fruit does not fill out and mature, but drops\r\n     prematurely or, in some cases, remains attached to the trees\r\n     long after the leaves have fallen. Round, black spots form on\r\n     the leaves when attacked by the fungous. These become dead and\r\n     brown and in most cases the whole leaf is destroyed. When\r\n     attacked, the trees are usually so badly injured that they make\r\n     little progress. Not all varieties are subject to the disease\r\n     in the same degree and some appear to be entirely exempt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by H. A. Gossard._\r\n\r\nFIG. 36. Spraying Pecan Trees.]\r\n\r\n     Those varieties which are not attacked should be given\r\n     preference in propagating work. The disease may be further\r\n     controlled by spraying with Bordeaux mixture, as directed under\r\n     leaf-blight.\r\n\r\n     PECAN ROSETTE: [L]\"The earliest symptoms are a peculiar\r\n     crimping of the leaves at the ends of the branches. These\r\n     leaves are smaller with crimped margin, and when held to the\r\n     light show light green or yellow streaks between the veins. The\r\n     leaf tissue in these light-colored areas is thin and\r\n     undeveloped and often breaks away leaving angular holes in the\r\n     leaves. A tree usually shows the disease over the whole top at\r\n     once, though sometimes only a single branch is affected at\r\n     first. As the disease progresses, the foliage assumes a bunched\r\n     appearance, due to the formation of tufts of leaves at the ends\r\n     of the branches. This characteristic has led us to use the term\r\n     \"Rosette\" as a name for the malady.\r\n\r\n     \"The next stage of the disease which is observed the second\r\n     year or later, is a dying-back of the branches from the tips.\r\n     This is followed by the development of numerous small, lateral\r\n     branches from adventitious buds. These are short, producing\r\n     thick clusters of small, unhealthy leaves, sometimes reduced to\r\n     mere skeletons, so that the rosetted appearance of the tree is\r\n     intensified. This goes on from year to year. The growth of the\r\n     tree is checked and these abnormal branches are formed only to\r\n     die back each year. Trees in the earliest stages of rosette\r\n     have been observed to have light crops of nuts, but, when badly\r\n     diseased, are barren and unsightly or worse. Rosette has been\r\n     found in all ages, from nursery stock to trees forty feet high.\r\n\r\n     \"The cause of the disease remains a mystery. No fungous or\r\n     other parasite can be detected in the earliest stages. The\r\n     appearance of the trees leads us to infer that the trouble is\r\n     internal, due to some derangement of the nutritive or\r\n     assimilative functions of the plant, but we are unable to\r\n     correlate this with any corresponding external conditions. That\r\n     is to say, that so many cases have been observed on fertile\r\n     soil, when cultivation, drainage and plant food had all been\r\n     provided, that it is impossible to conclude that the disease\r\n     could be due to starvation or to the lack of any single element\r\n     in the soil, nor can it be due to over-feeding, since it occurs\r\n     in light soils and in neglected orchards.\r\n\r\n     \"It seems probable that it will be classed by the plant\r\n     pathologist with peach rosette, peach yellows, and related\r\n     diseases, the causes of which still remain unknown after years\r\n     of investigation. The indications are that it is contagious,\r\n     though a complete demonstration of this point remains to be\r\n     made; at any rate, it must be regarded with concern until more\r\n     knowledge is available.\"\r\n\r\n     The best recommendation that can be made in regard to pecans\r\n     affected by this disease is to dig them up and burn them.\r\n\r\n         BORDEAUX MIXTURE.\r\n\r\n         Copper sulphate,         5 pounds.\r\n         Lime (unslacked),        5 pounds.\r\n         Water,                  50 gallons.\r\n\r\n     Dissolve the copper sulphate in two gallons of water, place it\r\n     in barrel No. 1 and add water to make twenty-five gallons.\r\n     Slack the lime, reduce it to a very thin paste, place it in\r\n     barrel No. 2 and add water to make twenty-five gallons. To mix\r\n     the solutions of lime and copper sulphate, dip a bucketful from\r\n     each barrel, and pour together into the barrel of the spray\r\n     pump. _The two mixtures should flow together as they are poured\r\n     into the barrel._ This is one of the secrets of making a\r\n     first-class mixture. The best arrangement is to have the\r\n     barrels, Nos. 1 and 2, elevated, and use a piece of rubber hose\r\n     to run the liquids into the pump barrel.\r\n\r\n     If a large amount of spraying is to be done, a somewhat\r\n     different policy should be pursued. Too much time would be\r\n     taken up in preparing the ingredients in small quantities.\r\n     Instead, large amounts of copper sulphate should be dissolved\r\n     and large quantities of lime slacked beforehand. This may be\r\n     done as follows:\r\n\r\n     In a fifty-gallon barrel place about forty gallons of water.\r\n     Put one hundred pounds of copper sulphate in a sack and suspend\r\n     it in the water. As soon as dissolved, fill up to the\r\n     fifty-gallon mark. When well stirred, each gallon will contain\r\n     two pounds of copper sulphate. Each time some of the solution\r\n     is dipped out, the height of the remaining portion should be\r\n     marked on the inside of the barrel. Before taking more of the\r\n     solution out of the barrel, any amount of water lost by\r\n     evaporation should be made good by filling up to the mark last\r\n     made.\r\n\r\n     As soon as procured the lime should be slacked, placed in a\r\n     barrel and kept covered with an inch or two of water. In this\r\n     way it can be kept indefinitely.\r\n\r\n     To prepare Bordeaux mixture from these stock solutions, dip out\r\n     two and a half gallons of the copper sulphate solution, place\r\n     it in barrel No. 1 and dilute to twenty-five gallons. From the\r\n     slacked lime take fifteen pounds, or thereabouts, to allow for\r\n     the water it contains, reduce to a thin paste, place it in\r\n     barrel No. 2 and add water to make twenty-five gallons. Pour\r\n     the contents of barrels Nos. 1 and 2 together, as already\r\n     directed.\r\n\r\n     _Tests_: If free copper be present, severe injury may be done\r\n     to the foliage or other tender parts of the plants. Sufficient\r\n     lime should be added to neutralize it.\r\n\r\n     Dip out a small quantity in a porcelain saucer or shallow bowl,\r\n     and holding it on a level with the mouth, blow the breath\r\n     gently into it. If a thin pellicle forms on the surface, more\r\n     lime must be added. Add and test until it does not form. An\r\n     excess of lime will not hurt.\r\n\r\n     Another test is to dip the blade of a clean knife into the\r\n     mixture. If a thin film of copper forms on it after holding it\r\n     there a minute or so, more lime must be added.\r\n\r\n     Use good materials and prepare the mixtures thoroughly.\r\n\r\n     In making up the various mixtures, never use iron vessels, but\r\n     use glass, wood or crockery receptacles instead.\r\n\r\n     Strain all mixtures thoroughly into the spray pump to prevent\r\n     clogging of the pump or nozzles.\r\n\r\n     Spray thoroughly and in good season. _Be in time._\r\n\r\n     Do not use mixtures which have been leftover and allowed to\r\n     stand for some time.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[L] Orton, W. A., proceedings second annual convention National Nut\r\nGrowers' Association, 1903, p. 82. 1904.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nINSECTS ATTACKING THE PECAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome time ago the statement was occasionally made that the pecan had no\r\nknown enemies. This, to thinking and observing persons, was too good to\r\nbe true, and fortunately the words, \"no known,\" were inserted, for later\r\ninvestigations, particularly on the part of Profs. Gossard and Herrick,\r\nhave revealed the fact that the pecan, in common with all other fruit\r\ntrees, is subject to the attacks of insect and other enemies. But the\r\noutlook is hopeful, for we know of the abandonment of no fruit industry\r\nbecause of the attacks of insect pests, and the pecan industry is in no\r\nwise in danger of being abandoned because of their inroads.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEEDING HABITS OF INSECTS.\r\n\r\nIf an insect is to be successfully controlled, the grower must know\r\nsomething of its life-history, and particularly of its feeding-habits.\r\nCareful observation of the insect, while at its work of destruction,\r\nwill frequently give a clue to the method of control. Many insects, like\r\nthe caterpillars of the pecan, bud-moth and case-worm, obtain their food\r\nby biting off pieces of the leaves or other parts of the tree and\r\nswallowing the solid particles. On the other hand, a number of insects,\r\nsuch as the scales and plant-lice, obtain their food by thrusting their\r\nsmall, bristle-like sucking tubes into the tissues of the leaves and\r\nsucking out the juices contained in the cells.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VIII. The Pecan Bud Moth (Proteopteryx deludana).\r\n\r\n1. Winter stage on bud, enlarged. 2. Tube made in leaf. 3. Work of bud\r\ndestruction. 4. Caterpillar, enlarged about twice. 5. Cocoon, enlarged.\r\n6. Chrysalis, reduced. 7. Moth, enlarged. 8. Moth, about natural size.]\r\n\r\nIt is quite obvious that these two classes of insects cannot be\r\ncontrolled or destroyed in the same way. Those which eat solid particles\r\nof food may, in most cases, be destroyed by applying some poisonous\r\nsubstance, such as arsenate of lead or Paris green, to the food which\r\nthey eat. But those which obtain their food by sucking cannot be killed\r\nin this way. They can be destroyed, however, by spraying over their\r\nbodies some substance, such as kerosene emulsion, which will penetrate\r\ntheir bodies and so kill them. Or, they may be killed by suffocating\r\nthem with a gas or by stopping up their breathing pores with some\r\npowdered substance, such as pyrethrum. Some insecticides, such as resin\r\nwash, act both as a caustic application and a suffocating covering.\r\n\r\nFor convenience in referring to insects which attack the pecan, we have\r\ngrouped them as follows: (1) Insects attacking buds and leaves; (2)\r\nInsects attacking the trunk and branches; (3) Insects attacking the\r\nfruit.\r\n\r\n\r\n     INSECTS ATTACKING BUDS AND LEAVES.\r\n\r\n     THE BUD WORMS: At least two species of caterpillars are known\r\n     by this name. The moth of one has been called the bud-moth. The\r\n     caterpillar of the other has been called the case-worm. Prof.\r\n     Gossard writes, that he unexpectedly found adult moths of\r\n     _Proteopteryx deludana_, November 28th, 1905, and therefore\r\n     believes, from this observation and other circumstantial\r\n     evidence, that he was \"mixed\" regarding the autumn life-history\r\n     of these insects, as set forth in Bulletin 79 of the Florida\r\n     Experiment Station. He furnishes the following paragraph as a\r\n     summary of what he can say of the bud worms:\r\n\r\n     \"The Bud Moth, _Proteopteryx deludana_, is a serious pest,\r\n     especially in young orchards. Sometimes, in such orchards, even\r\n     when large, scarcely a tree can be found during the month of\r\n     May that does not contain one or several nests. The\r\n     caterpillars are usually found singly, each with one side of a\r\n     leaf folded over it and fastened to form a tube, or sometimes\r\n     two leaves are fastened together with silken bonds and the\r\n     caterpillar feeds between them. As fast as the leaves it has\r\n     attached become brown and die, it draws fresh leaves to the\r\n     dead ones and fastens them there, thus gradually making a very\r\n     conspicuous nest. The caterpillar is full grown during the last\r\n     of May and the first of June when they transform into moths.\r\n     Their pupæ cases are formed of silk and excrement, smoothly\r\n     lined with silk and snugly hidden away in a nest of leaves. In\r\n     about two weeks from the time of pupation, the moths appear.\r\n     Early specimens have sometimes been hatched from buds, only\r\n     partially expanded. They are small, about five-sixteenths of an\r\n     inch in length and five-eighths of an inch across the expanded\r\n     wings. In general color they are grayish, streaked and dotted\r\n     with blackish-brown. A characteristic habit is to alight and\r\n     rest on the tree trunk, head downward. The moths have again\r\n     been observed in November, suggesting that there are two broods\r\n     a year. Thorough, persistent spraying with arsenate of lead or\r\n     Paris green, in April and May, ought to control this species.\"\r\n\r\nTHE CASE WORM (_Acrobasis nebulella_): This insect, often found\r\nassociated with the bud moth, probably does more damage than any other\r\npecan insect. The caterpillars are about five-eighths of an inch in\r\nlength, a dirty brownish-green in color, and live in silk-lined cases or\r\ntubes attached to the petioles of the leaves. From these they protrude\r\nthemselves to feed. Frequently a pair of leaflets are tied together\r\n(Plate IX, Fig. 6), and between these the caterpillars live and feed\r\nupon the tips of the protecting leaflets. Opening buds, partially\r\ndeveloped and full-grown leaves alike are destroyed. Earlier in the\r\nseason, characteristic nests of partially eaten leaves, petioles and\r\nexcrement are formed by several caterpillars tying the mass together\r\nwith silk. In this nest they live and develop. The caterpillars pupate\r\nwithin their silken tubes, and the small gray moths (five-eighths to\r\nthree-fourths of an inch in length) emerge about two weeks after\r\npupation, chiefly in June. The small, hibernating \"cocoons\" found on and\r\naround the buds in winter and the tortuous tubes observed on the leaves\r\nin summer and fall, which have been referred to (_Proteopteryx\r\ndeludana_), probably belong to this species. At least, caterpillars\r\none-fourth grown and contained in cocoons apparently not essentially\r\ndifferent from the smaller ones, contain worms having the characteristic\r\nappearance of the grown _acrobasis_. Spraying with arsenicals in April,\r\nMay and June should destroy this pest. Spraying in late July and August\r\nwould also promise results of value.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE IX. The Case Worm.\r\n\r\n1. Supposed winter stage. 2. Caterpillar, enlarged. 3-4. Moth, nearly\r\nnatural size. 5. Cases. 6. Work on leaves.]\r\n\r\nTHE CATOTOCALAS (_Catocala piatrix_ and _C. viduata_): The caterpillars\r\nof these insects are frequently found during April, May and June feeding\r\nupon the leaves of the pecan. They are ravenous feeders, and if present\r\nin sufficient numbers, considerable damage is done. The caterpillars are\r\nfrom two to two and a half or three inches in length when fully\r\nextended, gray and striped, leathery in appearance, very closely\r\nresembling the back of the tree upon which they rest when not feeding.\r\nHaving attained its full growth as a caterpillar, it ties together two\r\nor three leaves with strands of silk, thus making a loose cocoon within\r\nwhich it pupates. The pupa is dark brown, covered with a whitish or\r\nbluish-white bloom. In about one month the moths emerge. They are large\r\nin size, the body being one to one and one-fourth inches long and the\r\nexpanded wings two and one-half to three inches across. When at rest\r\nthey are dull gray in color, more or less marked with irregular waving\r\nlines. The hind or under-wings are strikingly different from the\r\nfore-wings. In C. piatrix they are deep orange-yellow marked from side\r\nto side with two black bands. The hind-wings of C. viduata are dark\r\nbrown and edged with a narrow white band.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillars may be destroyed by spraying with some one of the\r\narsenical poisons, or they may be removed by hand and destroyed. Prof.\r\nGossard recommends the tying of a piece of burlap around the trees.\r\nBeneath this the caterpillars hide during the night and they may then be\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE X. A Pecan Catocala. (C. Piatrix.)\r\n\r\nCaterpillar, Cocoon, Chrysalis, and Moths about one-half natural size.]\r\n\r\nTHE FALL WEB-WORM (_Hyphantria cunea_): The caterpillars of this insect\r\nbegin work early in spring, shortly after the leaves are full grown.\r\nThey work in colonies, and the leaves on which they feed are enclosed in\r\na web, which is extended as the caterpillars grow or as they require\r\nadditional leaves to feed upon. When full grown the caterpillars measure\r\nabout one inch in length and are covered with hairs both long and short.\r\nThe matured caterpillars leave the webs and crawl down the trees to hunt\r\nfor places beneath the bark, under sticks, weeds and trash in which to\r\npupate. A light, flimsy cocoon, composed of silk and the hairs of the\r\nlarva, is made. From this, in due time, a beautiful moth, an inch or an\r\ninch and a quarter across the wings, emerges. The wings are pure white\r\nor white spotted with black or brownish-black. The eggs are laid in\r\nmasses of four or five hundred on the leaves. These hatch in about ten\r\ndays, and the colonies of young caterpillars begin their work of\r\ndestruction. There are two broods in the South each summer; the first\r\nappearing in May and June, the second in August and September. The fall\r\nbrood hybernates in the pupa state.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillars may be destroyed on small trees by removing the webs\r\nand killing the larvæ. On large trees a torch of some sort may be used\r\nto burn the web and the caterpillars within it. They may be also held in\r\ncheck by applying a spray of Paris green or arsenate of lead at the time\r\nthe broods are feeding.\r\n\r\nTHE PECAN CATERPILLAR (_Datana interrigma_): A buff-colored moth, having\r\na body about one-half inch long and a wing expanse of one and\r\nthree-fourths inches, with four transverse brown stripes on the front\r\nwings, lays its greenish or white eggs in clusters of five to twelve\r\nhundred on the underside of the lower leaves of the pecan trees. These\r\neggs hatch in less than a week, and the colonies of young caterpillars\r\nat first feed upon the undersides of the leaves. They cast their skins\r\nfour times, each time increasing in size and changing their color\r\nsomewhat. The last moult, and sometimes the last two, take place on the\r\ntrunk of the tree, and the clusters of discarded skins frequently remain\r\nfor several months afterwards. After the last moult they ascend the\r\ntrees, remain feeding for a short while, then go down to the ground to\r\npupate. When disturbed, the larvæ raise both ends of their bodies from\r\nthe twigs or leaves, on which they rest. They are easily recognized by\r\nthis habit. When full grown they are one and one-half to one and\r\nthree-quarters of an inch in length, covered with dirty white hair, and\r\nmarked with two conspicuous longitudinal white lines, one on each side\r\nof the body. There are two broods, the last one hibernating in the\r\nground in the pupa state.\r\n\r\nThe leaves on which the eggs are laid may be gathered and destroyed, or\r\nthe colonies of young caterpillars may be gathered and burned. Later,\r\nthey may be burned off with a torch, killed when clustered on the trunk\r\nduring the last moult, or poisoned with an arsenical spray.\r\n\r\n\r\nINSECTS ATTACKING THE TRUNK AND BRANCHES.\r\n\r\nTHE TWIG GIRDLER (_Oneideres cingulatus_ and _O. texana_): These two\r\ninsects frequently do considerable damage to pecan trees in late summer\r\nby cutting off the smaller branches. Branches from one-fourth to\r\nthree-fourths of an inch are usually the ones attacked. The insect is a\r\nbeetle, and the two species closely resemble each other. They are dark\r\ngray in color, one half to five-eighths inch in length, with antennæ\r\nlonger than the body and provided with stout, powerful mandibles. The\r\nfemale insect cuts the branch by working round and round it until it is\r\nalmost entirely severed. She then lays a number of eggs in it, usually\r\none or two being placed near each bud. A small cut is made and the egg\r\nis inserted between the bark and the wood, and the opening is then\r\nsealed up with a gummy substance. As the insect moves along the twig a\r\nseries of transverse cuts are made in the bark. The twigs usually drop\r\nto the ground. The eggs hatch as soon as the weather becomes\r\nsufficiently warm in spring, and the larvæ feed in the twigs, making\r\ntunnels through them as they grow. Later, they pupate within the tunnels\r\nand emerge during August and September as fully developed insects,\r\nhaving spent one year in their growth from egg to mature insect. It is\r\nbelieved that in some cases the life cycle lasts two years.\r\n\r\nThe best and most effective treatment is to gather and burn all the\r\ntwigs which have been cut from the trees. This should be done,\r\npreferably late in autumn after the leaves have fallen, as there is\r\ngreater certainty of getting all the severed twigs than if left until a\r\nlater date.\r\n\r\nTHE OAK PRUNER (_Elaphidion villosum_): Sometimes[M] pecan twigs, when\r\nsmartly bent, will snap off with a clean, square cut across the\r\nbranches, as if they were hollow-glass tubes, breaking at cracked or\r\nweakened places. An examination of such a broken stem shows \"that its\r\nwoody part, with the exception of a few fibers and the bark, has been\r\ncut across as if with a saw by a soft, yellowish-white grub, which can\r\noften be found in a burrow in the severed part. Since the uncut bark is\r\nthe chief support left for the branch, any stiff wind or even its own\r\nweight will break it off as soon as it has become deadened. * * * * * *\r\n\r\n     \"The adult is a longicorn beetle, of slender, cylindrical form,\r\n     over one-half inch in length and about one-eighth of an inch in\r\n     width. It is of a dull, black color, tinged with brown on the\r\n     wing covers, especially toward their tips. The underside of the\r\n     body and legs are chestnut colored. Over all parts of the body\r\n     can be found short, grayish hairs. Some small, gray spots on\r\n     the wing-covers and a whitish dot on each side of the thorax\r\n     are formed by dense collections of gray hairs at these points.\r\n     Coarse, round punctures are thickly sprinkled over the upper\r\n     surface of the thorax and wing-covers.\r\n\r\n     \"The larva, when grown, is about three-fifths of an inch long,\r\n     tapering backwards from the neck. The body is divided by deep\r\n     grooves into twelve rings or segments. There are three pairs of\r\n     feet. The color is yellowish-white, the front of the head being\r\n     blackish. Probably, about midsummer, with a possible variation\r\n     of two mouths in each direction from this date, the parent\r\n     beetle deposits her eggs, preferably on a small twig of the\r\n     preceding year's growth. Upon hatching, the young larva\r\n     commences to eat the tender wood just beneath the bark, and\r\n     later enters the center of the twig and works toward its base.\r\n     In this manner it works its way into the main limb, which may\r\n     be of considerable size, and feeds within it for a period of\r\n     about three years. The burrow thus becomes several inches in\r\n     length, in many cases. Just before transforming to pupæ some,\r\n     but not all, of the larvæ, cut the wood for the purpose of\r\n     dropping the branches, as before described. Limbs in which the\r\n     immature larvæ are working often break off with ragged end when\r\n     bent with the hand.\r\n\r\n     \"* * * Pick up and burn all fallen branches. Similar attention\r\n     should be given nearby oak and hickory limbs, which have\r\n     fallen.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PECAN TREE BORER (_Sesia scitula_): The moth of this insect is\r\nclear-winged and closely resembles the moth of the peach tree borer.\r\nLittle is known of its life-history.\r\n\r\n\"It[N] is probable that the eggs are deposited by the female moth on the\r\nbark of a tree near a fresh wound. For example, near newly set buds. The\r\neggs hatch and the larvæ bore into the bark, and there live for a time,\r\neating out the soft inner-bark and tender wood. It is certain that the\r\nborers live in these situations the over winter and change to pupæ in\r\nthe spring, from which the moths emerge in April. The moths I reared\r\nappeared April 3rd, 4th and 6th. The pupæ are in cocoons, just under the\r\nbark. The cocoons are made from excrement and bits of bark that have\r\nbeen fastened together with silk similar to the cocoons of the peach\r\ntree borer. Whether these moths, that emerge in the spring, lay eggs and\r\nproduce a brood in the summer, that in turn develops a fall brood of\r\nlarvæ, I am unable to say.\"\r\n\r\n\"The[O] young borer is apt to gain entrance to the sapwood through some\r\nwound in the bark, such as a graft-union, and here it feeds, sometimes\r\ncompletely girdling the sapwood above and below the wound. It is said to\r\nprefer to attack buds that have been budded on old, large trees. As a\r\ngeneral rule the burrows ascend the tree in a spiral about the trunk, so\r\ncomplete girdling is unusual, but growth sometime ceases above the\r\ngroove, new limbs being shot out from below.\"\r\n\r\nThe only satisfactory means of controlling this pest is to go carefully\r\nover the tree and dig out the borers. The trees should be examined from\r\ntime to time in order to keep them free from borers.\r\n\r\n\r\nINSECTS ATTACKING THE FRUIT.\r\n\r\nTHE PECAN WEEVIL (_Balantinus caryae_): In some localities considerable\r\ndamage has been caused by the pecan weevil. The insect is a small,\r\nbrownish-black snout beetle, somewhat less than one-half inch in length.\r\nThe proboscis or snout is slender and as long as the body. With this\r\nproboscis the beetle bores a very small hole through the husk and shell\r\nof the immature pecan to the kernel, and at the bottom deposits an egg.\r\nThis egg hatches into a larva, which feeds upon the kernel of the nut.\r\nIn autumn the larvæ, when full grown, bore holes through the shells of\r\nthe pecan and enter the ground in which they pass the winter. The next\r\nseason they emerge from the earth as fully-matured insects, and about\r\nthe month of August deposit their eggs in the nuts.\r\n\r\nAfter the harvesting of the crop the hogs should be allowed to feed\r\nunder trees in which the weevil is present, so as to devour any infested\r\nnuts which may have been left on the ground. Poultry may also be of\r\nassistance in destroying the insects after they have entered the ground\r\nto pupate. It is probable that the larvæ in the nuts may be destroyed by\r\nfumigating with carbon bi-sulphide. The nuts should be placed in a tight\r\nbox, and one-half pound for each five hundred cubic feet of space used,\r\nallowing them to remain for forty-eight hours.\r\n\r\nTHE HICKORY SHUCK WORM (_Grapholitha caryana_): Sometimes pecan nuts are\r\nattacked, as they approach maturity, by a small, white caterpillar,\r\nwhich mines its way through the shucks of the nuts. This caterpillar is\r\nthe hickory shuck worm, the larva of a small moth.\r\n\r\nBut little is known of its life-history, and until more is known of its\r\nhabits, the best advice that can be given is to gather and destroy the\r\ninfested nuts by burning them.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[M] Gossard.\r\n\r\n[N] Hedrick.

Literature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nPECAN KERNELS.\r\n\r\n\r\nPecan nuts are used in a variety of ways. Not so very long since they\r\nwere used almost entirely for dessert purposes, now they are largely\r\nused in making pastries and confections of different kinds. Based on\r\nthese uses, new industries for supplying the kernels have been\r\ndeveloped. The kernels are now put on the market in glass jars of\r\ndifferent kinds and sizes, usually retailing at from 50 cents to 75\r\ncents per pound. This is perhaps the most convenient form in which to\r\nbuy them, but unfortunately, they are too frequently old and rancid.\r\nWhen stock is carried through the heat of summer in the ordinary jar,\r\nthis is invariably the case, and some new method of packing them must be\r\nintroduced if this way of disposing of the product is to increase in\r\nfavor, as it should. Certain experiments now under way give promise that\r\nthe kernels can be kept fresh and free from rancidity indefinitely.\r\n\r\nFor the present, at least, the only certain way of procuring good, fresh\r\npecan kernels is to procure fresh nuts--those which have been kept over\r\nin cold-storage are good--and crack them at the time when they are\r\nneeded. For the household, an ordinary pair of nut-crackers will answer,\r\nbut they should be of a particular type. The jaws should be formed with\r\nsharp-cutting edges.\r\n\r\n\r\nNUT-CRACKERS.\r\n\r\nIn the accompanying illustration, four kinds of nut-crackers are shown.\r\nThe two at the right are reversible. The best pair is represented at the\r\nextreme left of the engraving. The bars are square, the grooves in them\r\nare curved inward leaving the teeth sharp and pointed out flush with the\r\nedge.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From American Nut Journal, Petersburg, Va._\r\n\r\nFIG. 37. Nut Crackers of different types.]\r\n\r\nTo remove the kernels without breaking, grasp the nut with the crackers\r\nas close to the end as possible, and gently but firmly apply sufficient\r\npressure to force the sharp teeth of the crackers into the shell.\r\nRevolve the nut and repeat the operation until the end is marked with a\r\nring of indentations. Then apply a little greater pressure to start a\r\nslight crack, and follow the crack around until the end of the shell\r\ndrops off. Treat the opposite end in the same way. Next, place the nut\r\nlengthwise between the crackers, so they will grasp the side, having the\r\nbacks of the two halves of the kernel, not the space between the halves,\r\ntowards the bars. This must be emphasized, because, if pressure is\r\napplied at right angles to the edges of the halves instead of against\r\ntheir backs, the chances are that they will be broken when the shell is\r\nbroken. Having the crackers in position, apply sufficient pressure to\r\ncrack the shell. Shift the crackers a little to one side of the crack,\r\napply pressure again and a piece of the shell breaks out. A few gentle\r\nsqueezes will remove the remainder of the shell and the kernel drops out\r\nintact.\r\n\r\nA hand-power cracker, capable of quite efficient work, is manufactured\r\nby Thomas Mills & Bro., Philadelphia, Penn. It has a capacity of one\r\nhundred pounds per day, and is capable of giving ninety per cent. of\r\nperfect halves.\r\n\r\nFor factory use, two machines, for extracting kernels at a rapid rate,\r\nhave been invented, one by Mr. Robert E. Woodson, St. Louis, Mo., and\r\nthe other by Mr. Grim, New York city. These make it possible to extract\r\npecans in large quantities for commercial purposes. The nuts are fed\r\ninto a hopper and the machine then takes care of them. In regard to the\r\nWoodson machine shown in the adjoining illustration, the inventor says\r\nthat \"in cracking one hundred pounds of nuts there were obtained 39-1/2\r\npounds of perfect halves and 3-1/2 pounds of broken pieces. This test\r\nshows 92 per cent. of perfect halves. I do not claim that this result\r\nmay be obtained at all times and under all conditions, for the hardness\r\nof the shell and the dryness of the nuts make a difference in the\r\nresults.\"\r\n\r\nPecans which have become somewhat dry should be soaked in water over\r\nnight. This renders them much more easily cracked.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 38. Woodson's Power Kernel Extractor.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPECAN OIL.\r\n\r\nOil extracted from almonds, peanuts, cocoanuts and other nuts is now\r\nused for various purposes, and at no distant time it is probable that\r\npecan oil may also be placed on the market. Only the cheaper, inferior\r\ngrades of nuts can be used in oil-making, as the larger and better\r\nquality of nuts are worth too much for dessert purposes.\r\n\r\nOrdinary nuts will run about fifty per cent. kernels, and these kernels\r\nanalyze about seventy per cent. oil or fat. On this basis one hundred\r\npounds would give approximately thirty-five pounds of oil. Of course the\r\nbetter grades of nuts will give sixty per cent. kernels, and would\r\nconsequently yield more oil.\r\n\r\nPecan oil might be used as a salad oil. It might be put to other\r\nculinary uses, as well as finding a possible place among medicinal\r\noils.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nPECAN LITERATURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut little has been written on the culture of the pecan.
